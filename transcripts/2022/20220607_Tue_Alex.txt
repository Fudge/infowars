[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:48.000]  Who would have thought that you could find a worse press secretary than Jen Psaki?
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.600]  But Karine Jean-Pierre is having serious problems.
[00:51.600 --> 00:52.600]  It doesn't matter.
[00:52.600 --> 00:57.960]  She doesn't even have to be able to read or speak English for that matter, because you
[00:57.960 --> 01:02.480]  see, she's, she's black and she's gay and she's an immigrant.
[01:02.480 --> 01:05.400]  And so therefore, she's the greatest press secretary of all time.
[01:05.400 --> 01:09.840]  It doesn't matter if the IQ is zero and she can't even speak for herself, which is the
[01:09.840 --> 01:11.440]  problem is the case.
[01:11.440 --> 01:18.000]  And so she gets caught up with really tough questions like, hey, what is the Biden administration
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.320]  doing about the record high gas prices?
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.240]  See Saki would go through the debate of, oh, do I deny and lie?
[01:26.240 --> 01:32.760]  Or do I go off the response that we have scripted here from the Democrat Party talking points?
[01:32.760 --> 01:36.320]  And then she would be able to at least look you in the eye and lie to you and communicate
[01:36.320 --> 01:37.880]  like a lizard human.
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.360]  Saki could talk, Karine Jean-Pierre has to read off of cue cards.
[01:44.360 --> 01:48.720]  And so when all you have is a literal cue card of scripted responses, communication
[01:48.720 --> 01:50.440]  becomes pretty tough.
[01:50.440 --> 02:00.080]  And here's an example of that in clip 11.
[02:00.080 --> 02:14.120]  So everything's on the table as you heard us say the last couple of weeks, but I do
[02:14.120 --> 02:19.960]  want to say, you know, if you look at what happened when Putin started amassing troops
[02:19.960 --> 02:25.440]  on the border with Russia, the price of gas has increased by a dollar and 51 cents increased
[02:25.440 --> 02:26.440]  by more than that before.
[02:26.440 --> 02:30.440]  And I also want to add, because this is really important so that people understand and flag
[02:30.440 --> 02:36.040]  that similar issues are happening around the world in the EU gases, $8 and 15 cents per
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.480]  gallon, and has increased by $1 and 74 cents, because Biden gave Russia control of the pipelines
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.240]  and 88 cents per gallon has increased $2 and 16 cents in Canada.
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.880]  This is $6 and 23 cents per gallon, and has increased $1 and 93 cents in all of this
[02:51.880 --> 02:54.040]  has happened since December of 2021.
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.160]  This is to your point, Phil, which is this is a global challenge.
[02:58.160 --> 03:01.800]  This is something that everyone is feeling across the globe.
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.640]  And but we understand that prices, these gas prices, including food prices in particular,
[03:06.640 --> 03:12.280]  those two things as we look at inflation and trying to make sure that we're fighting inflation
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.520]  in every way that we can.
[03:13.520 --> 03:14.520]  Another thing they cause.
[03:14.520 --> 03:16.640]  It's hurting families, it's hurting families.
[03:16.640 --> 03:17.640]  Yeah, your policy.
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.640]  So, so imagine it.
[03:18.640 --> 03:19.640]  Pause real quick.
[03:19.640 --> 03:20.640]  So imagine it.
[03:20.640 --> 03:22.920]  They have public policy.
[03:22.920 --> 03:30.320]  The Democrats have public policy that they're going to stop what they call greenhouse gases
[03:30.320 --> 03:36.200]  or carbon emissions or fossil fuels or oil companies.
[03:36.200 --> 03:37.640]  And that's their public policy.
[03:37.640 --> 03:42.880]  And then they implement their public policy and then prices skyrocket.
[03:42.880 --> 03:46.760]  They shut down pipelines, they cut off energy, prices skyrocket.
[03:46.760 --> 03:54.240]  They give Russia control of the pipelines, the key pipelines in Europe and prices skyrocket.
[03:54.240 --> 03:58.680]  And then and then Jean Pierce sits there and says, yes, well, you know, this is Russia's
[03:58.680 --> 03:59.680]  fault.
[03:59.680 --> 04:01.520]  And well, this is just a worldwide problem.
[04:01.520 --> 04:04.800]  And you know, it might even be worse in Europe than it is for you here.
[04:04.800 --> 04:09.360]  And so, but see, what's the problem?
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.440]  It's just reading off of cue cards.
[04:14.440 --> 04:20.240]  Imagine trying to be the press secretary for the president of the United States.
[04:20.240 --> 04:24.680]  And you just have a little pamphlet in front of you with with your scripted responses,
[04:24.680 --> 04:29.760]  your cue card of responses, and you're supposed to just read off that for whatever litany
[04:29.760 --> 04:33.040]  of questions you may receive from the media.
[04:33.040 --> 04:35.880]  And you just have to look down and read off a cue card.
[04:35.880 --> 04:38.520]  Yeah, that's going to be a problem.
[04:38.520 --> 04:42.640]  It's going to be a challenge to try to properly communicate when you literally have a finite
[04:42.640 --> 04:46.400]  things, a finite list of things you can say.
[04:46.400 --> 04:48.560]  But hey, they have public policy.
[04:48.560 --> 04:49.560]  We're shutting off the oil.
[04:49.560 --> 04:51.760]  Oh, you're shutting off the oil, then prices go up.
[04:51.760 --> 04:55.040]  And then they say, well, we don't know why these prices are going up.
[04:55.040 --> 04:56.720]  We'll try to figure it out.
[04:56.720 --> 05:01.440]  But it's their own public policy.
[05:01.440 --> 05:06.040]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[05:06.040 --> 05:11.200]  a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[05:11.200 --> 05:12.200]  You see it every year.
[05:12.200 --> 05:17.400]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[05:17.400 --> 05:23.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.600]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[05:26.600 --> 05:27.600]  this and knowing this.
[05:27.600 --> 05:33.200]  So it's a very important situation with inflation, all the things out there hurting everybody
[05:33.200 --> 05:36.240]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[05:36.240 --> 05:38.760]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[05:38.760 --> 05:44.200]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[05:44.200 --> 05:51.360]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[05:51.360 --> 06:17.360]  or call 833-904-285, 833-904-285.
[06:21.360 --> 06:34.040]  And it's an honor to be with you on this Tuesday, June 7, 2022 live edition of the Alex Jones
[06:34.040 --> 06:35.040]  show.
[06:35.040 --> 06:42.040]  Alex is taking a well-deserved and I'm sure much needed vacation.
[06:42.040 --> 06:43.720]  So Alex, I love you.
[06:43.720 --> 06:51.120]  We all love you, Alex, and we miss you, but please enjoy some time off, refresh the batteries.
[06:51.120 --> 06:55.760]  And if you're tuning in today expecting Alex Jones, I'm sorry, I'll try my best.
[06:55.760 --> 07:05.280]  I'll try my best to fulfill your desire for the truth, unvarnished, uncensored, like his
[07:05.280 --> 07:10.680]  tradition here on the Alex Jones show for more than two decades.
[07:10.680 --> 07:16.040]  And I'm also going to be here live with you all the way through the end of the war room.
[07:16.040 --> 07:22.480]  So double duty and I do have six hours of news to cover easily, maybe even more so we
[07:22.480 --> 07:24.560]  may have to cram.
[07:24.560 --> 07:29.480]  Let's look at the waterfront today.
[07:29.480 --> 07:39.400]  Now I don't like talking about January 6th because of ongoing legal stuff, but obviously
[07:39.400 --> 07:44.000]  I'm innocent and so therefore I can't lose.
[07:44.000 --> 07:53.920]  And I could have a rigged case against me, which is the case, or I could not do well
[07:53.920 --> 07:59.720]  in court, but that would just be political persecution by bad people against me, by the
[07:59.720 --> 08:03.120]  worst people of this country being politically persecuted by them.
[08:03.120 --> 08:04.120]  That's an honor.
[08:04.120 --> 08:06.520]  That's a victory.
[08:06.520 --> 08:15.880]  But there are big developments in the January 6th narrative now, or at least the Democrats
[08:15.880 --> 08:20.960]  are trying to bring it back because everything else has failed them, folks.
[08:20.960 --> 08:24.960]  They cannot figure out what is going to get people to the polls.
[08:24.960 --> 08:29.360]  And so they're going through this cycle now.
[08:29.360 --> 08:35.000]  They're wash, you know, repeat cycle now and they're back on January 6th.
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.360]  Now notice, they've tried Ukraine, they've tried abortion, they've tried everything
[08:41.360 --> 08:48.080]  under the sun and that was after they already tried January 6th and that didn't work.
[08:48.080 --> 08:52.920]  But now they're back on January 6th and the same people that promised you, like Adam
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.600]  Schiff and others, remember they promised you that they had proof of Russian collusion.
[08:57.600 --> 09:04.320]  Well, I mean, I can sit here and tap on my watch, but I'd be doing that for the rest
[09:04.320 --> 09:08.600]  of my life because there is no evidence of Russian collusion because there never was
[09:08.600 --> 09:09.880]  any Russian collusion.
[09:09.880 --> 09:15.520]  And now we all know it was just made up by Hillary Clinton and her campaign.
[09:15.520 --> 09:20.200]  But see Adam Schiff and the Democrats that promised you, they promised that they would
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.680]  show the evidence that they had of Russian collusion.
[09:22.680 --> 09:27.760]  Think about the boldness of those liars to stand up there and tell you they are going
[09:27.760 --> 09:31.680]  to give you something that they don't have and they know doesn't exist.
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.160]  Now they're doing the same thing with January 6th, saying we've got more evidence, we've
[09:37.160 --> 09:38.960]  got more this, we've got more that.
[09:38.960 --> 09:46.120]  Yeah, well, you've been doing proctology exams of everybody that you could, that you possibly
[09:46.120 --> 09:51.240]  could involve with January 6th and everyone's cooperating with you because nobody has anything
[09:51.240 --> 09:52.760]  to hide.
[09:52.760 --> 09:56.760]  And so let's see if they do decide they're going to try to piece something together for
[09:56.760 --> 10:08.120]  a public viewing, I think that's their plan as they now hired an ABC News producer or news
[10:08.120 --> 10:14.920]  editor to now run the Democrat Party propaganda over January 6th.
[10:14.920 --> 10:22.360]  And I'm pretty sure it was the same guy who helped ABC News spike the Jeffrey Epstein story.
[10:22.360 --> 10:27.240]  Remember that with Gina Rohrbach?
[10:27.240 --> 10:35.040]  Yeah, the same people that cover up sex trafficking are the ones that are going to put out a media
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.880]  puff piece for their own political purposes about January 6th.
[10:40.880 --> 10:44.800]  But I'll cover that later.
[10:44.800 --> 10:49.320]  You heard Jean Pierre in the first segment.
[10:49.320 --> 10:53.400]  I don't know how it's not a bigger news story, and I know it's kind of a big news story,
[10:53.400 --> 10:58.280]  but I mean, this should be like, this is like a five alarm fire at this point.
[10:58.280 --> 10:59.400]  Are we in a recession?
[10:59.400 --> 11:01.160]  Are we in a depression?
[11:01.160 --> 11:05.000]  What is going on now?
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.440]  Gas prices have doubled, energy prices are skyrocketing, your grocery bill, I mean, everything
[11:09.440 --> 11:10.760]  is just going up right now.
[11:10.760 --> 11:12.520]  It's unbelievable.
[11:12.520 --> 11:17.760]  And it's all in the mainstream news, I mean, nobody's even denying it.
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.920]  But when do they tell you you're in a recession, when do they tell you you're in a depression,
[11:22.920 --> 11:29.760]  or when do they tell you, actually, this is all planned to destroy you and to put you
[11:29.760 --> 11:36.480]  into a new caste system in a world government, you're now impoverished for the rest of your
[11:36.480 --> 11:43.600]  life because, well, you're producing too much of a carbon emission, see?
[11:43.600 --> 11:48.720]  And I've got it all lined up, how they're doing it, how they admit it, how they brag
[11:48.720 --> 11:54.680]  about it, but that's just the next level.
[11:54.680 --> 12:02.200]  Every day now is a new national average of price per gallon gas reaching a record high.
[12:02.200 --> 12:10.640]  It's now at $4.91 national average highest it's ever been, and it's going up.
[12:10.640 --> 12:13.760]  And then you've got people saying, I can't afford rent, I can't afford my grocery bill
[12:13.760 --> 12:16.000]  anymore, I can't afford my energy bill anymore.
[12:16.000 --> 12:21.080]  And then Biden comes out and makes statements saying, best economic recovery ever, best economy
[12:21.080 --> 12:23.800]  in the history of America, literally, he makes these statements.
[12:23.800 --> 12:27.840]  But then you read the news and there's nothing of the sort there.
[12:27.840 --> 12:34.000]  But the important thing to understand is, it's all being done by design.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.040]  It's not by accident.
[12:36.040 --> 12:38.000]  It is their public policy.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.040]  How do you think you're going to stop man-made climate change, folks?
[12:42.040 --> 12:45.760]  You're going to have to get rid of man, aren't you?
[12:45.760 --> 12:48.200]  You're going to have to stop the man in that equation.
[12:48.200 --> 12:50.520]  Have you figured it out yet?
[12:50.520 --> 12:52.240]  We're going to stop man-made climate change.
[12:52.240 --> 12:55.840]  Well, what's the first word of that, man?
[12:55.840 --> 12:58.480]  They're going to stop man.
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.560]  Sounds satanic, it is.
[13:02.560 --> 13:14.880]  And I mean, at this point, could Hillary Clinton like leave a trace of DNA at a suicide scene
[13:14.880 --> 13:16.960]  and still get away with it?
[13:16.960 --> 13:23.000]  No, I'm sure this is, I'm sure that the Clintons are perfectly innocent.
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.080]  I shouldn't, I shouldn't bring up the Clintons.
[13:26.080 --> 13:30.520]  It's just another Clinton associate shot and hung himself.
[13:30.520 --> 13:32.320]  That's a new one.
[13:32.320 --> 13:34.200]  I don't know what's more ridiculous.
[13:34.200 --> 13:40.240]  A Clinton associate, Vince Foster, I believe it was, chopped himself up into little bitty
[13:40.240 --> 13:43.240]  pieces and put himself in a duffel bag.
[13:43.240 --> 13:45.440]  He did that all on his own.
[13:45.440 --> 13:49.120]  Look out David Blaine.
[13:49.120 --> 13:51.000]  Look out Chris Angel.
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.720]  Clinton friends are chopping themselves up, putting themselves in duffel bags and now blowing
[13:54.720 --> 14:00.800]  and now blasting themselves apart with a shotgun and then hanging themselves from a tree.
[14:00.800 --> 14:06.880]  That's in a, wow, wow, family of Bill Clinton advisor who admitted Jeffrey Epstein into White
[14:06.880 --> 14:11.320]  House seven times has blocked release of files detailing the death scene after he was found
[14:11.320 --> 14:14.920]  hanging from a tree with a shotgun blast.
[14:14.920 --> 14:15.920]  What?
[14:15.920 --> 14:19.840]  I mean, he, he, he hung himself and shot himself with a shotgun.
[14:19.840 --> 14:22.400]  Why is this so hard to believe?
[14:22.400 --> 14:23.400]  So what?
[14:23.400 --> 14:25.800]  It's another Clinton associate that commits suicide.
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.320]  They just know a lot of people.
[14:30.320 --> 14:31.320]  Oh my goodness.
[14:31.320 --> 14:32.320]  Oh my goodness.
[14:32.320 --> 14:38.720]  Then you have Hunter Biden, more images leaking from, I don't even know where these things
[14:38.720 --> 14:39.720]  are coming from now.
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.240]  I don't know if it's all from the same laptop or their new images coming up, but as if you
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.240]  didn't have enough.
[14:45.240 --> 14:46.240]  Now you've got Hunter Biden.
[14:46.240 --> 14:48.800]  He always seems to be naked using drugs with hookers.
[14:48.800 --> 14:50.400]  I don't know.
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.640]  Always seems to be naked using drugs with hookers and wanting to capture the evidence
[14:55.640 --> 14:58.120]  of this for a video or a photo.
[14:58.120 --> 15:03.440]  And now he's seen within illegal firearm.
[15:03.440 --> 15:06.000]  I mean, I don't know if it's actually illegal or not.
[15:06.000 --> 15:13.320]  There's no paperwork and that's the Democrats law, but he's holding a gun.
[15:13.320 --> 15:15.280]  He's got his finger on the trigger.
[15:15.280 --> 15:19.280]  He's naked using drugs with a hooker.
[15:19.280 --> 15:20.280]  And I don't know.
[15:20.280 --> 15:28.200]  Is that the same gun that he abandoned in a dumpster behind a school?
[15:28.200 --> 15:29.200]  Was that the same gun?
[15:29.200 --> 15:30.200]  I don't know.
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.520]  Is the gun that Hunter Biden is seen gripping in the latest images?
[15:35.520 --> 15:43.240]  Is that the same gun that he, that he ditched in a dumpster behind a schoolyard?
[15:43.240 --> 15:44.240]  I don't know.
[15:44.240 --> 15:45.440]  I'm sure CNN will be all over it though.
[15:45.440 --> 15:49.800]  I'm sure tonight, Rachel Maddow, I'm sure ABC world news.
[15:49.800 --> 15:53.080]  I'm sure it'll be, they will be asking the questions.
[15:53.080 --> 15:56.400]  Is Hunter Biden's gun from the new image with him using drugs with a hooker?
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.760]  Is it the same gun he ditched in a dumpster behind a schoolyard?
[15:59.760 --> 16:05.400]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[16:05.400 --> 16:06.880]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[16:06.880 --> 16:11.120]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[16:11.120 --> 16:12.800]  I tried to stop it.
[16:12.800 --> 16:17.840]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[16:17.840 --> 16:23.000]  the globalist aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.600]  It's now out in the open.
[16:24.600 --> 16:28.720]  Claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[16:28.720 --> 16:31.200]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[16:31.200 --> 16:34.200]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:34.200 --> 16:37.400]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[16:37.400 --> 16:38.400]  We're going to win this thing.
[16:38.400 --> 16:39.400]  God's watching.
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.400]  The children are counting on us.
[16:40.400 --> 16:44.040]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[16:44.040 --> 16:47.720]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.880]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[16:51.880 --> 16:54.160]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.680]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[16:58.680 --> 16:59.800]  your efforts.

[17:58.760 --> 18:02.520]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[18:02.520 --> 18:07.120]  the internet and mobile technology first came out which is we thought this is going to level
[18:07.120 --> 18:08.120]  the playing field.
[18:08.120 --> 18:10.600]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[18:10.600 --> 18:13.360]  to freely communicate that information.
[18:13.360 --> 18:19.320]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.360]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[18:24.360 --> 18:29.240]  we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[18:29.240 --> 18:36.480]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[18:36.480 --> 18:41.480]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[18:41.480 --> 18:43.960]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.360]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them take back
[18:48.360 --> 18:49.360]  their privacy.
[18:49.360 --> 18:54.520]  And so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening will
[18:54.520 --> 19:00.840]  check us out at boltowireless.com, that's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[19:00.840 --> 19:04.840]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[19:04.840 --> 19:07.720]  on both at home and the world at large.
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.920]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep
[19:12.920 --> 19:16.960]  support formula, down and out, is just the thing.

[19:21.680 --> 19:24.440]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[19:24.440 --> 19:29.240]  Wanted to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs
[19:29.240 --> 19:34.360]  and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[19:34.360 --> 19:38.800]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[19:38.800 --> 19:44.040]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally
[19:44.040 --> 19:49.760]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.040]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will
[19:54.040 --> 19:55.920]  be down and out.
[19:55.920 --> 20:00.440]  Sell it out now at www.infoorstore.com.
[20:00.440 --> 20:28.000]  Eating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.440 --> 20:54.280]  President Joe Biden has been an absolute unmitigated disaster, but that's exactly what he was
[20:54.280 --> 21:03.480]  put in to do, and it's incredible today to see the lies coming from the White House,
[21:03.480 --> 21:06.520]  coming from Joe Biden.
[21:06.520 --> 21:08.920]  Who is buying this stuff?
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.440]  Here's some of the tweets that have come from the President's account today.
[21:13.440 --> 21:18.840]  Tell me if this offends you from Joe Biden this morning.
[21:18.840 --> 21:25.000]  The fact is America is in a stronger economic position today than just about any other country
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.240]  in the world.
[21:27.240 --> 21:32.880]  Really is that why the dollar is crashing and the ruble is going up?
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.680]  Is that why countries are about to start doing gas deals and oil deals, not using the U.S.
[21:38.680 --> 21:39.680]  dollar?
[21:39.680 --> 21:40.680]  That's interesting to me.
[21:40.680 --> 21:43.960]  That's a strong economic position?
[21:43.960 --> 21:46.400]  Seems he'd be lying there.
[21:46.400 --> 21:54.480]  Human experts have projected that the United States economy could grow faster than China's
[21:54.480 --> 21:57.760]  economy this year.
[21:57.760 --> 22:09.360]  That hasn't happened since 1976, when Joe Biden was in office.
[22:09.360 --> 22:14.880]  Because of our actions last year, 2021 marked the largest deployment of solar, wind and
[22:14.880 --> 22:17.840]  batteries in the U.S. history.
[22:17.840 --> 22:22.800]  Today I'm building on that progress by authorizing the Defense Production Act.
[22:22.800 --> 22:23.800]  Here we go, folks.
[22:23.800 --> 22:25.600]  Brace yourself for this.
[22:25.600 --> 22:32.440]  To lower energy costs, strengthen the power grid, and create good paying jobs.
[22:32.440 --> 22:37.160]  Funny, because energy costs are only going up.
[22:37.160 --> 22:40.880]  All we hear about now is how there's going to be rolling blackouts all summer because
[22:40.880 --> 22:41.880]  of the heat.
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.480]  Has it been hot before?
[22:45.480 --> 22:46.640]  And then create good paying jobs.
[22:46.640 --> 22:47.640]  Really?
[22:47.640 --> 22:49.360]  That's why no one can afford anything anymore?
[22:49.360 --> 22:50.360]  Hmm.
[22:50.360 --> 22:51.360]  Amazing.
[22:51.360 --> 22:54.920]  Everything he says, the opposite is true.
[22:54.920 --> 22:56.440]  He continues to lie.
[22:56.440 --> 23:01.560]  At the time I took office about 16 months ago, the economy had stalled and COVID was out
[23:01.560 --> 23:02.760]  of control.
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.320]  Actually, the economy was booming when Trump was in office.
[23:06.320 --> 23:10.960]  And actually, there had been more COVID deaths since you were in office, the first year in
[23:10.960 --> 23:15.320]  fact that you were in office, then the year Trump was in office with COVID, so two lines
[23:15.320 --> 23:16.320]  there.
[23:16.320 --> 23:20.840]  Today, thanks to the economic plan and the vaccination plan that my administration put
[23:20.840 --> 23:26.600]  into action, again, Trump's vaccine plan, Operation Warp Speed, this is an incredible
[23:26.600 --> 23:27.600]  one to me.
[23:27.600 --> 23:31.960]  The Democrats are literally trying to take responsibility for the death shot.
[23:31.960 --> 23:34.400]  And Trump's not even letting them have it.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.840]  Trump is like, no, I want responsibility for that death shot.
[23:37.840 --> 23:41.000]  Biden says, it was my death shot.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.000]  So literally Trump's vaccine plan too, I mean, incredible.
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.080]  But Biden says it says, America has achieved the most robust recovery in modern history.
[23:51.080 --> 23:58.240]  Again, that would be, if you could make that claim, it would be Trump that could make that
[23:58.240 --> 24:02.360]  claim by almost every economic metric.
[24:02.360 --> 24:05.920]  It's incredible, isn't it?
[24:05.920 --> 24:10.680]  So you might say, boy, how can a president, how can a man get away with such lies?
[24:10.680 --> 24:16.880]  Well, it's pretty easy when the media covers for you and when your voters have barely a
[24:16.880 --> 24:18.920]  double digit IQ.
[24:18.920 --> 24:19.920]  That's how.
[24:19.920 --> 24:21.800]  It's called Democrats.
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.920]  And boy, oh boy, are they an absolute cancer on this country.
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.760]  Boy, oh boy, are they a death sentence for any prosperous civilization.
[24:30.760 --> 24:32.920]  Here's what's really going on.
[24:32.920 --> 24:40.040]  Washington Post, 2020, November, 2020, Washington Post, conservatives predict gas prices will
[24:40.040 --> 24:42.120]  spike under Joe Biden.
[24:42.120 --> 24:44.080]  Experts say those fears are overblown.
[24:44.080 --> 24:45.400]  And yet here we are today.
[24:45.400 --> 24:51.480]  Gas prices have more than doubled and we have a record high in all 50 states.
[24:51.480 --> 24:52.480]  Hmm.
[24:52.480 --> 24:54.200]  I guess they lied to you then too.
[24:54.200 --> 24:55.880]  They always lie to you.
[24:55.880 --> 24:58.080]  They always lie.
[24:58.080 --> 25:06.400]  Pete Butt, Judge, Slam's GOP is going to war with Mickey Mouse while Dems find solutions
[25:06.400 --> 25:07.400]  to inflation.
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.960]  You mean the Democrats cause the inflation?
[25:10.960 --> 25:12.080]  It's incredible.
[25:12.080 --> 25:14.200]  Democrats say they're finding a solution to inflation.
[25:14.200 --> 25:16.600]  No, Democrats are causing inflation.
[25:16.600 --> 25:17.920]  I'm just, why?
[25:17.920 --> 25:19.680]  How is this twilight zone even real?
[25:19.680 --> 25:23.320]  Here's Democrats causing inflation and then they say, we're finding a solution to inflation.
[25:23.320 --> 25:24.920]  No, you're causing the inflation.
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.520]  And what does that even mean, GOP going to war with Mickey Mouse?
[25:28.520 --> 25:36.240]  You have Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida dealing with Disney World there.
[25:36.240 --> 25:39.320]  Other than that, where is the GOP going to war with Mickey Mouse?
[25:39.320 --> 25:44.200]  I mean, it's just lies on top of lies.
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.240]  If the Democrats couldn't lie, they wouldn't be able to talk.
[25:48.240 --> 25:51.440]  But so here's what actually happens.
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.200]  And we all know this is their public policy.
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.080]  If you understand they want to stop man-made climate change, understand they want to stop
[25:58.080 --> 25:59.080]  man.
[25:59.080 --> 26:02.600]  Well, how do you stop man-made climate change?
[26:02.600 --> 26:03.600]  Well, you stop man.
[26:03.600 --> 26:06.000]  So the Democrats want to stop man.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  They want to stop humanity.
[26:07.000 --> 26:08.800]  Do you understand that yet?
[26:08.800 --> 26:10.920]  They're trying to stop humanity.
[26:10.920 --> 26:11.920]  But it's just the globalist.
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.520]  The Democrats are just either dumb enough to fall for it or corrupt enough to buy into
[26:15.520 --> 26:16.920]  it.
[26:16.920 --> 26:22.120]  Earthjustice launches golf regional office that's in Houston led by Jen Powis, the new
[26:22.120 --> 26:23.120]  managing attorney.
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.080]  So it's a bunch of leftists starting this place there in Houston because, you know,
[26:28.080 --> 26:29.080]  Texas is a big oil state.
[26:29.080 --> 26:35.000]  And it's all about defeating man-made climate change and stopping fossil fuels and oil
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  and coal.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.000]  Oh, OK.
[26:37.000 --> 26:38.000]  And then what happens?
[26:38.000 --> 26:42.200]  Well, your energy price is double and triple and quadruple, and nobody can afford life
[26:42.200 --> 26:43.200]  anymore.
[26:43.200 --> 26:44.200]  And the Democrats do it.
[26:44.200 --> 26:46.120]  And then they say, we're solving the problem.
[26:46.120 --> 26:47.760]  And then they cause every problem.
[26:47.760 --> 26:53.920]  LA announces Marta Segura as first chief heat officer as city prepares for hot summer
[26:53.920 --> 26:54.920]  months.
[26:54.920 --> 26:58.760]  They have a whole new department, the office of climate emergency mobilization.
[26:58.760 --> 26:59.760]  And again, it's the same thing.
[26:59.760 --> 27:01.600]  They are going to stop man-made climate change.
[27:01.600 --> 27:03.800]  In other words, they're going to stop man.
[27:03.800 --> 27:05.480]  They're going to stop you.
[27:05.480 --> 27:06.480]  OK.
[27:06.480 --> 27:08.480]  So that's their public policy.
[27:08.480 --> 27:09.680]  That's their plan.
[27:09.680 --> 27:11.760]  They tell you all of it.
[27:11.760 --> 27:13.400]  And then what happens?
[27:13.400 --> 27:19.480]  You have national average of gas per gallon reaching record high in all 50 states.
[27:19.480 --> 27:21.320]  It's not just gas prices.
[27:21.320 --> 27:28.720]  Electricity rates are up 77 to 233% in the last year.
[27:28.720 --> 27:31.480]  So they announce all these plans.
[27:31.480 --> 27:35.280]  Of course, there's inflation, but it's really the consumer price index, the supply chain
[27:35.280 --> 27:38.280]  crisis, and the Democrats shutting off your energy.
[27:38.280 --> 27:43.520]  That's what's really causing the economic strain more so than even inflation at this
[27:43.520 --> 27:44.920]  point.
[27:44.920 --> 27:49.080]  That's why you're really heading into a depression now.
[27:49.080 --> 27:52.040]  So they say, we're going to eliminate carbon emissions.
[27:52.040 --> 27:54.760]  We're going to stop man-made climate change.
[27:54.760 --> 27:56.680]  That's stopping man.
[27:56.680 --> 27:59.440]  And then they announce all their public policy and how they're going to do it.
[27:59.440 --> 28:01.560]  And then the result is what?
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.120]  All the prices go up, and there's scarcity, and they say, oh, we're going to solve these
[28:05.120 --> 28:08.400]  problems as it's their public policy to cause them.
[28:08.400 --> 28:09.400]  So what?
[28:09.400 --> 28:10.400]  So then your rent goes up.
[28:10.400 --> 28:11.400]  You can't afford rent.
[28:11.400 --> 28:12.400]  We're all afraid.
[28:12.400 --> 28:13.400]  Washington Post.
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.400]  We're all afraid.
[28:14.400 --> 28:16.160]  Massive rent increases hit mobile homes.
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.040]  Park rents are doubling or tripling as high demand, low inventory, and a rise in corporate
[28:21.040 --> 28:26.040]  owners takes a toll on one of the nation's biggest sources of affordable housing.
[28:26.040 --> 28:27.600]  But I thought it was the most robust recovery.
[28:27.600 --> 28:29.400]  I thought it was the most high-paying jobs.
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.440]  But now more people are looking to rent space in mobile homes and live in mobile homes or
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.480]  out of their vans.
[28:39.480 --> 28:40.840]  So there you go.
[28:40.840 --> 28:43.840]  Oh, and then you can't get any goods either.
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.960]  Ship pollution is rising as the US waits for world leaders to act.
[28:46.960 --> 28:50.240]  Yeah, they're sick of ships and trucks burning fuel.
[28:50.240 --> 28:51.760]  Hey, stop that ship.
[28:51.760 --> 28:55.240]  Sir, this has necessary items for this country.
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.240]  Stop that ship.
[28:56.240 --> 28:57.240]  Stop that truck.
[28:57.240 --> 28:58.240]  And then the whole economy collapses.
[28:58.240 --> 28:59.240]  And they say, what happened?
[28:59.240 --> 29:00.240]  We'll fix it.
[29:00.240 --> 29:05.260]  We're about to address the viewers and listeners of M4 Wars and to remind you that we've been
[29:05.260 --> 29:10.600]  vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now
[29:10.600 --> 29:12.440]  out of the open.
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.080]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic.
[29:16.080 --> 29:18.480]  And we cannot continue in this fight without your support.
[29:18.480 --> 29:21.560]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now.
[29:21.560 --> 29:27.840]  But you still can, to get the third and final coin in the Founding Member coin series, the
[29:27.840 --> 29:34.320]  and take it free men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com and just a few days this

[29:44.920 --> 29:47.840]  history. So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you
[29:47.840 --> 29:53.240]  all to be part of history and to get this historic memento that keeps us on
[29:53.240 --> 29:59.800]  air at infowarstore.com or 1776coin.com while you still can.
[29:59.800 --> 30:05.160]  Info Wars has made history. You have made history in your support of Info Wars.
[30:05.160 --> 30:10.040]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has
[30:10.040 --> 30:14.160]  been Patriot apparel so we can identify each other so we can spread the word
[30:14.160 --> 30:18.280]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they can
[30:18.280 --> 30:21.920]  understand the globalist plan and how to stop it. Now ladies and gentlemen two
[30:21.920 --> 30:24.920]  months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts

[32:55.280 --> 32:58.840]  now infowarsstore.com
[32:58.840 --> 33:11.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[33:14.200 --> 33:21.680]  And now the tip of the spear leading the fight to take back the nation it's
[33:21.680 --> 33:32.760]  Owen Shroyer. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The Democrats got a big
[33:32.760 --> 33:39.280]  problem and that's despite all their propaganda and all their attempts to
[33:39.280 --> 33:45.560]  prop Biden up and keep Trump down the latest approval numbers are in and
[33:45.560 --> 33:55.600]  still Biden is way lower than Donald Trump. Way lower. Pretty amazing. In fact
[33:55.600 --> 34:02.120]  he's he's he's been lower than Trump for about half of his presidency and I would
[34:02.120 --> 34:08.160]  expect he'll remain lower for the rest. So what do you do? What do you do when the
[34:08.160 --> 34:13.960]  guy that you've propped up the the reanimated husk of a 50-year lifelong
[34:13.960 --> 34:19.080]  career criminal politician and nobody buys your media anymore. Nobody buys your
[34:19.080 --> 34:23.040]  propaganda anymore. Nobody buys your lies anymore and and he's such a failure
[34:23.040 --> 34:27.800]  that the American people obviously see what's going on. The the blatant theft of
[34:27.800 --> 34:33.240]  the 2020 election. Biden didn't even campaign. Trump got 50,000 average at
[34:33.240 --> 34:40.320]  events. Biden gets more votes than Obama. I mean you can go on and on but you know
[34:40.320 --> 34:45.880]  the point. So the point is that and imagine if the media wasn't lying
[34:45.880 --> 34:49.200]  about Trump all day long and they weren't lying about Biden all day long to
[34:49.200 --> 34:52.600]  protect him. Trump's approval rating would probably be up above 60 all the time
[34:52.600 --> 34:55.880]  and and Biden's would be below 40 but that's if we had a real media if that's
[34:55.880 --> 35:00.480]  if we lived in reality. We lived in the corrupt clown world now. So Biden only
[35:00.480 --> 35:06.120]  trails Trump by like you know 10 points on the approval rating scale. It's only
[35:06.120 --> 35:09.560]  going to continue to go down as gas prices continue to go up and the
[35:09.560 --> 35:12.880]  consumer price index continues to go up. So what do you do? What do you do if
[35:12.880 --> 35:20.840]  you're then the Democrats? You've just been caught red-handed stealing the 2020
[35:20.840 --> 35:25.920]  presidential election. Do you really want to double down and steal it in the light
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.120]  of day again in the midterms? That might be your only choice. What do you do? You've
[35:31.120 --> 35:34.960]  tried all these things to see if you could activate voters to get to the
[35:34.960 --> 35:39.240]  polls and they all kind of fell flat. Interest in Ukraine is down. They didn't
[35:39.240 --> 35:42.720]  really get many people to show up at Roe vs. Wade stuff. They're not ready to
[35:42.720 --> 35:49.440]  fully go national with a with a midterm campaign on you know pro pedophilia like
[35:49.440 --> 35:54.720]  drag queen dance time for kids. I mean what else have they tried? What else have
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.440]  they tried in the last 12 months to try to activate voters that's just failed?
[35:58.440 --> 36:02.760]  They got the gun control issue. It's all it's all fallen flat. It's all fallen
[36:02.760 --> 36:05.720]  flat. They're not producing numbers. They're not producing interest and it's
[36:05.720 --> 36:11.480]  not going to produce voters. So now they're going back to January 6th and they
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.800]  don't even hide it anymore. They publish their plan on the front page of the New
[36:16.800 --> 36:22.160]  York Times. January 6th hearings give Democrats a chance to recast midterm
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.720]  message. That came out first thing this morning for the front page of the New
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.760]  York Times. January 6th hearings give Democrats a chance to recast midterm
[36:31.760 --> 36:38.560]  message. In other words they're going to use January 6th as their main issue
[36:38.560 --> 36:43.240]  entering the midterms. Now are they are they settling on this now considering
[36:43.240 --> 36:47.360]  we've only got 154 days left to the midterms or are they going to abandon
[36:47.360 --> 36:51.320]  this ship when they realize it's a failing operation as well and move on to
[36:51.320 --> 37:01.080]  whatever the next current thing is. And they hired a news producer from ABC News
[37:01.080 --> 37:10.160]  a director to hype this up for a made for television event. Now imagine they've
[37:10.160 --> 37:16.280]  gone through thousands of individuals emails and text and everything for the
[37:16.280 --> 37:22.960]  last year and a half looking to find anything and of course they found
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.680]  nothing because there's nothing there. So now what they're going to do is they're
[37:27.680 --> 37:32.120]  going to basically put all that through a filter and do what you might call
[37:32.120 --> 37:36.440]  selective editing or cherry picking so that they can bring certain things up
[37:36.440 --> 37:40.880]  out of context present them to the public to try to sway public opinion
[37:40.880 --> 37:48.400]  against Republicans and to continue their agenda of demonizing patriots and
[37:48.400 --> 37:55.160]  excusing their political prisoners. Now that's what they're going to do. Is it
[37:55.160 --> 37:58.360]  going to take? Is America going to buy it? I don't think so but that's what the
[37:58.360 --> 38:01.640]  Democrats are going to do. They're already showing their hand. That's their plan.
[38:01.640 --> 38:08.680]  This is the most evil criminal hate-filled terrorist group in the
[38:08.680 --> 38:13.480]  history of America is the Democrat Party. And someday the Democrat Party, if
[38:13.480 --> 38:18.200]  America can survive this, will go down in the angels of history right next to the
[38:18.200 --> 38:25.160]  KKK because that's where it came from. And once America rids itself of the
[38:25.160 --> 38:30.400]  Democrat Party, we will have our next great renaissance. We will have our
[38:30.400 --> 38:37.600]  next great boom. We will have our next golden era. But first we must put the
[38:37.600 --> 38:41.900]  corruption and the crime and the lies and the deception and the hate and the
[38:41.900 --> 38:45.400]  terrorism of the Democrat Party behind us. But until that day comes, we'll
[38:45.400 --> 38:48.760]  continue to put up with this BS and they'll continue to lie and they'll
[38:48.760 --> 38:53.040]  continue to do TV stunts for political points. Think about it. They have
[38:53.040 --> 38:56.720]  political prisoners right now that they're torturing in jail. The Democrats
[38:56.720 --> 39:07.080]  are all for political points. That's how little they value human life. We all know
[39:07.080 --> 39:11.360]  about their abortion stance but they're willing to torture people in cells for
[39:11.360 --> 39:16.960]  their own political points. That's how sick the Democrat Party is. And the
[39:16.960 --> 39:21.360]  Republican Party just sits there and watches them. And Adam Schiff, the same
[39:21.360 --> 39:27.600]  guy who told you that he has proof of Russian collusion, multiple times Adam
[39:27.600 --> 39:31.400]  Schiff told you that. That he has the proof and he was going to show you the
[39:31.400 --> 39:35.320]  proof. He's yet to show that proof because he never had the proof because
[39:35.320 --> 39:40.800]  there was no proof because there was no Russian collusion. Adam Schiff is a
[39:40.800 --> 39:51.040]  liar. And now he says that he has proof of what on January 6. I don't know. He
[39:51.040 --> 39:56.600]  just says we've got new evidence. There's a great deal they haven't seen. Oh,
[39:56.600 --> 39:59.880]  you're right. You're right. The general public hasn't gone into people's
[39:59.880 --> 40:04.080]  private emails and messages like you freaks have. That's true. Yes, the general
[40:04.080 --> 40:08.240]  public has not read through thousands of Americans' emails and texts like a
[40:08.240 --> 40:14.400]  bunch of sycophant psychotic freaks like you, Adam Schiff. You're right. You're
[40:14.400 --> 40:17.200]  right, Adam Schiff. Most people don't go through people's private messages for
[40:17.200 --> 40:22.000]  their own political stunts. That's a you thing, Adam Schiff. That's a you thing.
[40:22.000 --> 40:26.240]  And where is your Russian collusion evidence, Adam Schiff? Oh, that's right.
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.720]  It doesn't exist. You lied about that too. But I'm sure you're being honest about
[40:29.720 --> 40:38.720]  this, Schiff. So then I see this. New. The coming collapse of Donald Trump's
[40:38.720 --> 40:44.240]  January 6 conspiracy. Part eight. Ali Alexander. I'm like, hmm, this is curious.
[40:44.240 --> 40:46.920]  I wonder what they're saying here. So I go to try to read this from Seth
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.560]  Abramson and oh, sorry, it's behind a paywall. The information is so important,
[40:52.560 --> 40:57.320]  folks. The information is so important. It's a matter of it's a matter of
[40:57.320 --> 41:03.000]  national security. It's so important that Seth Abramson wants you to pay 20 bucks
[41:03.000 --> 41:09.800]  to read his story that I'm sure is a giant nothing burger. So, man, oh, I'm
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.200]  really curious. I want to find out what did Ali Alexander do, Seth? Tell me,
[41:14.200 --> 41:21.880]  blocked by your paywall. Funny for a communist. Funny thing for a communist.
[41:21.880 --> 41:26.520]  Funny thing indeed, but it's not working. Bloomberg politics headline. Voters aren't
[41:26.520 --> 41:31.320]  punishing GOB candidates over January 6. Capital attack. Capital attack, but it's
[41:31.320 --> 41:34.920]  a peaceful protest when you burn and murder and rape and everything else you
[41:34.920 --> 41:42.120]  guys love to do. No, they're backing them. No, what the problem is, is the
[41:42.120 --> 41:47.560]  Democrats. That's your problem. Democrats are scumbag lying deceitful demons and
[41:47.560 --> 41:52.240]  people realize that now. That has nothing to do with January 6. Although I guess it
[41:52.240 --> 41:56.680]  does because what you're doing over January 6 is so criminal and so
[41:56.680 --> 42:01.520]  dangerous, even Tulsi Gabbard gets it. Tulsi Gabbard shreds Biden administration.
[42:01.520 --> 42:04.720]  They weaponize government against the people, but it's actually worse than
[42:04.720 --> 42:09.560]  that, Tulsi. They weaponize the government against their political opposition. So,
[42:09.560 --> 42:12.280]  yeah, it's against the people. It's against their political opposition.
[42:12.280 --> 42:16.560]  They've turned the government into a force for their agenda, for their
[42:16.560 --> 42:23.320]  party politics. And then again, oh, the Proud Boys. There's more. There are more
[42:23.320 --> 42:27.720]  charges against the Proud Boys. What about Black Lives Matter and Antifa that
[42:27.720 --> 42:32.600]  are responsible for the largest, most dangerous, murderous, and expensive
[42:32.600 --> 42:36.640]  riots in U.S. history? Anything for them? No, DOGA, FBI. No, they're not
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.400]  interested. Not interested. And they've got more. We've got more footage now of the
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.880]  police murdering Roseanne Boylan that day. And so everything they tell you about
[42:45.880 --> 42:49.720]  January 6th is a lie. But the Democrats still believe all the lies, even though
[42:49.720 --> 42:53.120]  all the people that died that day were Trump supporters killed by police,
[42:53.120 --> 42:56.760]  including an unarmed woman. Normally, the liberals would care about that, but not
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.640]  in this case. In this case, they're glad she's dead. The biggest sale of the

[43:57.160 --> 44:04.640]  tip of the spear. There is very little contemporary study in the world of the
[44:04.640 --> 44:10.320]  planet's ruling class. Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United
[44:10.320 --> 44:15.920]  States, not anywhere. Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class? And
[44:15.920 --> 44:20.240]  that's done by design. The large central banks that basically control the planet
[44:20.240 --> 44:25.760]  will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.160]  establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the Trilateral Commission of
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.880]  the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[44:32.880 --> 44:37.560]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg
[44:37.560 --> 44:41.560]  group, didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public and its former
[44:41.560 --> 44:46.440]  head, still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab. And he has set up the
[44:46.440 --> 44:51.080]  great reset in global government. And as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't
[44:51.080 --> 44:54.440]  address the globalist head-on about the fact that they are a worldwide
[44:54.440 --> 44:58.120]  authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. We do expose them. We
[44:58.120 --> 45:05.800]  can beat them easily. Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over
[45:05.800 --> 45:10.400]  the internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda
[45:10.400 --> 45:14.840]  is unpopular. They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more
[45:14.840 --> 45:19.240]  important than ever that we use every tool we've got. Well, ladies and gentlemen, if

[45:59.920 --> 46:05.640]  InfoWars has made history. You have made history in your support of InfoWars. And
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.880]  one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has
[46:09.880 --> 46:14.000]  been Patriot Apparel so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.120]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they can
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.760]  understand the globalist plan and how to stop it. Now, ladies and gentlemen, two
[46:21.760 --> 46:24.760]  months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[46:24.760 --> 46:28.720]  some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.
[46:28.720 --> 46:32.920]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.680]  your wardrobe. So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left. In a
[46:37.680 --> 46:40.720]  couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history. We're selling them
[46:40.720 --> 46:47.160]  all at cost at infowars.com. So, thank you all for your support. Please visit
[46:47.160 --> 46:52.000]  infowars.com and get one of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves,
[46:52.000 --> 46:55.480]  ball caps, you name it, while you still can. I want to thank you all for your
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.160]  support. InfoWarsStore.com.
[47:00.160 --> 47:19.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.160 --> 47:48.000]  You ever seen that before? Man, our crew is just awesome. I can just sit here. You
[47:48.000 --> 47:52.000]  guys, I had me in a trance with the awesome rock music with this shots of
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.800]  nature coming in. I don't even know how, you guys are like a lighting crew at a
[47:55.800 --> 48:00.640]  concert or something. It's all timed up. That's amazing stuff right there. The
[48:00.640 --> 48:05.920]  InfoWars crew, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe I should just shut up, let them take
[48:05.920 --> 48:13.200]  over here, give you a little light show. I don't know, I mean that's just the kind
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.200]  of stuff we're into here. We like life, you know? We like life. We like God's
[48:17.200 --> 48:23.640]  creation. We like nature. We like music. Horns, strings, vocals, we like it all.
[48:23.640 --> 48:28.960]  What can we say? We're just lovers of life, that's all. We're just big-time lovers
[48:28.960 --> 48:35.200]  of life and we see the enemies of life trying to destroy it and annihilate it
[48:35.200 --> 48:40.800]  and make it suffer in torment and torture and you know what? We don't take
[48:40.800 --> 48:47.400]  too kindly to that here. We don't really like that, not really fans of that. So we
[48:47.400 --> 48:52.760]  fight it. We fight it tooth and nail and Alex has been fighting it for 20 plus
[48:52.760 --> 48:57.560]  years, folks. And look, I gotta tell you, and believe me, I'm not claiming
[48:57.560 --> 49:01.480]  to be a victim. I hop on the roller coaster and buckle myself in every
[49:01.480 --> 49:08.120]  day and with a big smile on my face with my arms up in the air, but it really is
[49:08.120 --> 49:13.440]  tiring. I've only been here at InfoWars for six years now, being on air six days
[49:13.440 --> 49:17.200]  a week for like two or three years now and I can't even imagine with the
[49:17.200 --> 49:23.520]  commitment and veracity of Alex Jones doing it for 20 plus years. So really
[49:23.520 --> 49:26.640]  just incredible stuff, but it's this audience. It's the audience of
[49:26.640 --> 49:30.880]  activists. It's the audience of people that go out and pay it forward and
[49:30.880 --> 49:34.800]  spread the word and share the links and tell other individuals about what's
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.040]  happening on the planet and red pill them. That's what InfoWars is all about.
[49:41.040 --> 49:46.080]  And we fund ourselves. We don't have big pharmaceutical sponsors, big Hollywood
[49:46.080 --> 49:51.280]  sponsors, big billionaire, leftist activists controlling our message. No,
[49:51.280 --> 49:55.840]  we're totally independent because we sell our own supplements because we want
[49:55.840 --> 50:01.640]  you to be healthy. And that's what the supplements at InfoWarsStore.com are
[50:01.640 --> 50:06.480]  all about. Here's a perfect example. We know that a lot of people are deficient
[50:06.480 --> 50:10.320]  in vitamin D, specifically in the winter. Now, I know it's not winter right
[50:10.320 --> 50:18.600]  now, but we said, huh, people are deficient in vitamin D, kids in particular. So
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.200]  let's put out a supplement that's just vitamin D that kids might like. And we
[50:23.200 --> 50:27.440]  don't market it to kids, but I'm telling you, this would be a great thing for
[50:27.440 --> 50:30.560]  your kids every morning. Get them their vitamin D and it's the vitamin D three
[50:30.560 --> 50:36.360]  gummies, 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com. Buy or be aware, you'll have one or two

[52:04.800 --> 52:11.400]  All right. Where's my video list? Here we go. Here we are. Let's see what we've
[52:11.400 --> 52:21.080]  got here. All right. You know what? Let me just... Yeah, we'll do that later. We
[52:21.080 --> 52:28.400]  will do that later. Let's do this. We've got MSNBC and BBC
[52:28.400 --> 52:34.640]  combining now telling you they want to take all the guns, ban all the guns so
[52:34.640 --> 52:39.200]  they want to defund police and they want to disarm civilians. Boy, who could
[52:39.200 --> 52:44.000]  possibly see where that situation could go? And so here's the BBC reporter
[52:44.000 --> 52:51.760]  telling the MSNBC reporter it's time to just ban all the guns. Today is the 157th
[52:51.760 --> 52:59.480]  day of the year and there have been at least 246 mass shootings so far.
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.280]  Have you noticed that all of a sudden the liberal mainstream
[53:04.280 --> 53:10.800]  media cares about mass shootings? Have you noticed that? This is not a new
[53:10.800 --> 53:19.400]  phenomenon. It's not a new phenomenon. And the vast majority happen in Democrat
[53:19.400 --> 53:28.600]  run cities that have gun control by non-whites. But that's why the Democrats
[53:28.600 --> 53:32.920]  and the liberal media never talk about them. But now they're desperate to take
[53:32.920 --> 53:37.560]  your guns because they're more criminal than ever. And so they're deciding now
[53:37.560 --> 53:41.720]  they're going to talk about all the mass shootings. But it'll be interesting to see
[53:41.720 --> 53:45.560]  how are they going to walk the tight rope? How are they going to walk the
[53:45.560 --> 53:51.800]  high wire of talking about all the mass shootings and violent crime happening
[53:51.800 --> 53:57.320]  in their own backyards? In every Democrat run city is where they're going to be
[53:57.320 --> 54:00.880]  covering most of this violent crime. That's where it's happening. That's where
[54:00.880 --> 54:05.640]  all the spikes are happening. So how are they going to get away with covering
[54:05.640 --> 54:12.160]  the violent crime in a weird promotion of gun control? Oh, there's a lot of
[54:12.160 --> 54:15.320]  criminals out there, a lot of criminal activity. Let's take your guns. Okay, let's
[54:15.320 --> 54:18.560]  see how that works for them. That's what they're going with. But then how are they
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.120]  going to avoid the subject and the fact that all this crime happens in the
[54:23.120 --> 54:26.320]  Democrat run cities? That's going to be an interesting high wire for them, a
[54:26.320 --> 54:32.840]  balancing act, but they're going to give it a go. And so, but here they continue now
[54:32.840 --> 54:38.560]  where you have a bunch of Limies, a bunch of Redcoats again here. Again, the
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.400]  British telling us to take to turn our guns in just incredible stuff continue.
[54:42.400 --> 54:48.720]  Is normal life in America, Joe? Yeah, in Democrat run cities. I think
[54:48.720 --> 54:56.520]  Catty K, I am so glad you're here. Pause there again. Yeah, yeah, it's normal
[54:56.520 --> 55:04.080]  life for Americans in Democrat run cities. It's normal life for Americans in
[55:04.080 --> 55:10.000]  Democrat run cities. See, so they've already answered my question. That's how
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.520]  they're going to leave it out. They're just gonna act like you don't know it.
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.040]  They're not going to mention it. Continue. Queens, do you believe, but I,
[55:17.040 --> 55:20.040]  whenever I talk to good friends from Britain, conservative friends from
[55:20.040 --> 55:25.200]  Britain, Tories from Britain, people who share a lot of the same views as I do on
[55:25.200 --> 55:31.760]  Western civilization, on culture, on politics, on small government, they will
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.880]  look at me like I was having said, you Americans and your guns, what's what?
[55:37.880 --> 55:43.680]  And the contrast and it's between the United States and Great Britain is so
[55:43.680 --> 55:50.160]  striking, considering we share so much in common, but in this one area, it's just
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.600]  the difference is just shocking, isn't it? Yeah, I mean, this is making it very
[55:55.600 --> 55:59.640]  hard for allies of America, friends of America, people who love this country as
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.000]  I do, have lived here for very long to defend the country at the moment when
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.360]  every single morning we wake up and there is another mass shooting and we keep
[56:07.360 --> 56:10.960]  getting asked, what is going on in that country? Why can't they fix this? In the
[56:10.960 --> 56:16.560]  UK, you know this, Joe, they fixed it. It was a conservative government that
[56:16.560 --> 56:21.480]  fixed America, that fixed the United Kingdom's gun problem in 1980 after a
[56:21.480 --> 56:26.200]  mass shooting, they banned assault weapons in 1990s, they banned handguns after a
[56:26.200 --> 56:30.520]  shoot after one school shooting is all it took in Dunblane, Scotland and the
[56:30.520 --> 56:35.320]  United Kingdom banned handguns. It now has amongst the lowest rate of gun deaths
[56:35.320 --> 56:39.920]  of any Westernized countries and that was a conservative government that did
[56:39.920 --> 56:46.040]  it. America stands out as a complete exception. This is America's exceptional
[56:46.040 --> 56:50.560]  problem, its relationship with guns and the number of guns in this country and
[56:50.560 --> 56:55.280]  the seeming tolerance for the number of people that get killed by guns in this
[56:55.280 --> 57:01.640]  country, including children in schools, no other Western country. So, I mean,
[57:01.640 --> 57:08.040]  that's just an outright lie. It's just an outright lie. There are plenty of
[57:08.040 --> 57:15.000]  countries that have stricter gun control laws and higher rates of gun crime, see
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.560]  Mexico, see Brazil, that's just two examples, just two examples. Are those
[57:19.560 --> 57:26.240]  Western hemisphere countries, by the way? Oh, but she says, oh, I'm an ally, I'm an
[57:26.240 --> 57:34.400]  ally, I just want to take all your guns, I just want to disarm you. Of course, of
[57:34.400 --> 57:38.160]  course, that's how that's how it happens throughout human history. Your ally
[57:38.160 --> 57:42.920]  shows up and takes your guns, your ally shows up and takes your defense, your
[57:42.920 --> 57:46.040]  ally shows up and you turn in your weapons, they demand your weapons, that's
[57:46.040 --> 57:51.960]  how the ally always works, I see. I want to take a minute out to address the viewers
[57:51.960 --> 57:56.280]  and listeners of M4 Wars and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that
[57:56.280 --> 58:01.440]  world government and its tyrannical aim of depopulation is now out the open.
[58:01.440 --> 58:06.560]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot
[58:06.560 --> 58:10.280]  continue in this fight without your support. I want to encourage you all to be
[58:10.280 --> 58:15.240]  part of history right now, but you still can, to get the third and final coin in
[58:15.240 --> 58:21.440]  the founding member coin series, the common ticket free men bear arms coins at
[58:21.440 --> 58:27.680]  1776coin.com. In just a few days, this coin will be gone forever and you will
[58:27.680 --> 58:32.920]  have the coin in your possession and know you helped M4 War stay on air at the
[58:32.920 --> 58:36.920]  most critical time in our 28 year history. So I want to thank you all for your
[58:36.920 --> 58:41.120]  support and I want to encourage you all to be part of history and to get this
[58:41.120 --> 58:47.840]  historic memento that keeps us on air at M4WarStore.com or 1776coin.com while you
[58:47.840 --> 58:53.920]  still can. You see this? It's an M4 Wars Republic defense card with original
[58:53.920 --> 58:59.280]  M4 Wars art designed by yours truly with a little gold bar implanted in it and on
[58:59.280 --> 59:04.200]  the back it's got a hologram. There are only 25,000 of these in existence and
[59:04.200 --> 59:08.200]  they'll never be made again. The bank that owns the mint that has started
[59:08.200 --> 59:12.960]  putting these out the last few years just sold out of 300,000 of a similar
[59:12.960 --> 59:16.760]  offering that was 40% more than what we're selling these for and when you get
[59:16.760 --> 59:20.920]  three or more you can get these at 50% off and they fund the M4 War. Please
[59:20.920 --> 59:25.800]  visit M4WarStore.com and check out this amazing new art slash gold product. It's
[59:25.800 --> 59:29.240]  a collector's item and you'll know you helped fund the second American

[59:40.680 --> 59:43.960]  have had together would not have happened. We are the tip of the spear, you are the

[59:49.560 --> 59:58.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:58.400 --> 1:00:23.920]  So Americans are suffering record high inflation, record high energy prices,
[1:00:23.920 --> 1:00:29.360]  record high consumer price index rising. By all metrics, the economy is going the
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:36.640]  wrong direction for the American citizen. But don't let reality stand in the way
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:41.000]  of a good Democrat. Here's Biden telling you how good you have it.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.920]  A tide of trickled economics. Oh my god, pause it real there. See, you know, I just,
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:48.920]  you can't even play these guys for a second before they lie. Ladies and
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:01:01.480]  gentlemen. Oh, so frustrating. Trickled down economics is non-existent. It's made
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:09.520]  up, okay? It is a scarecrow. It is a straw man that liberals made up. I don't
[1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:13.760]  even know when it really dates back to. And this has been totally proven by
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:22.480]  Thomas Sowell, the famous economist, philosopher, and he's debated Democrats,
[1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:26.040]  he's debated liberals, he's debated communists. And every time they do this,
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:29.480]  every damn time they do this, they say, trickle down economics, trickle down. And
[1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:34.600]  he says, show me trickle down economics, show me the theory, show me the literature,
[1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:39.200]  show me the origin of the idea, show me where it comes from, show me it anywhere
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:44.640]  in American history. It literally doesn't exist, folks. It's a made up straw man by
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:51.200]  communists to punch at. Trickle down economic theory, there is no such thing.
[1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:56.520]  It is a made up straw man that Democrats punch at. So I'm sorry, I couldn't even
[1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:59.960]  get through two seconds of this Biden clip before having to correct a lie. I
[1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:06.400]  apologize. Let's go back. My plans are produced the strongest, fastest, most
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:12.480]  widespread economic recovery America's ever experienced with record jobs, ever
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:16.960]  experienced businesses and wages rising. All that's a lie. It's the foundation for
[1:02:16.960 --> 1:02:21.200]  an economy that works for working families. Because of that foundation, we're
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:25.480]  better positioned in any country in the world to overcome global inflation than
[1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:30.240]  we're seeing global inflation, reach a new chapter of stable and steady growth. So
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:35.280]  let's come together and focus on what's matter, on what matters. Let's build on
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:39.520]  the extraordinary progress we've made. Let's continue to build this economy from
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:43.160]  the bottom up in the middle out. When that happens, everybody does what we're
[1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:46.720]  including the very wealthy. Tell me how you're going to build the economy from
[1:02:46.720 --> 1:02:53.800]  the bottom up. I'd love to hear that. See, it's this thing that Democrats do.
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:03:00.440]  We'll cover it later, too. Or they're like, corporations are making record
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:06.640]  profits. Oh, they're making record profit. Really? Who do you think pays
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:12.200]  employees? Oh, is it corporations? Oh, businesses are making record profits.
[1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:18.160]  Oh, who hires people? Who pays bills? Who gives insurance
[1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:25.360]  benefits? Oh, it's the corporations. It's the businesses. Who builds the economy?
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:30.760]  Oh, that's the rich. That's the people with capital. Oh, let's put the burden on
[1:03:30.760 --> 1:03:35.200]  the poor to build the economy. That's Joe Biden's. Oh, we're going to build it from
[1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:38.800]  the bottom up. Sorry, that's not how it works. No matter how much you hate rich
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:47.760]  people. Sorry. Oh, but, you know, it's just unbelievable. So there you go.
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:53.120]  There's some good old fashioned lying there. They cannot help themselves. And so
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:58.120]  MSNBC went out on the streets and, well, let's just say every time MSNBC goes on
[1:03:58.120 --> 1:04:01.400]  the streets, the segment doesn't last 60 seconds. Let's just put it that way. So
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:06.160]  here's 30 seconds of MSNBC going out to the streets. Green car, an electric car,
[1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:11.720]  hybrid car. All right, two prong question for you, Lam. The first one is this, and
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:15.240]  Katie makes a great point. The fact that we are seeing gas prices impact people's
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:19.440]  pocketbook so much right now. Would that change how you're considering voting for
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:22.200]  the next election, whether it's congressional later this year or
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:25.880]  presidential a couple years down the road? Definitely. Definitely. I just know
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:30.520]  that one administration had cheaper gas and this administration has more
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:36.120]  expensive gas. And this is a bottom line, strictly financial conclusion for you. I
[1:04:36.120 --> 1:04:39.080]  mean, it's a housing market. It's everything you previously mentioned. I
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:44.840]  mean, gas is a big part of it. But I mean, right now we're cut the segment, cut
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:48.520]  it, cut it. He's telling the world how bad it is under Biden. We got to cut the
[1:04:48.520 --> 1:04:53.280]  segment. No more street interviews. Stop the segment. But oh, oh, you can't afford
[1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:58.520]  gas. Why don't you buy an electric car? Oh, thanks, liberal.
[1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:05.000]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.520]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:14.120]  feeling because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've
[1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:18.760]  talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalist
[1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:24.640]  aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents. It's now out in the open.
[1:05:24.640 --> 1:05:29.560]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group
[1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:35.240]  founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're making their move
[1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:38.640]  because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's
[1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:41.840]  watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and
[1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:45.080]  listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support
[1:05:45.080 --> 1:05:48.520]  because without you, info wars would not be here. I just want you to really
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:53.080]  internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity
[1:05:53.080 --> 1:05:56.600]  has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again for all
[1:05:56.600 --> 1:05:59.200]  you've done and ask you now to redouble your effort.
[1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:16.640]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:26.120]  Let's not forget Biden. He tried to start a war with Russia and it's really just the
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:30.880]  globalist war with Russia. But the Biden family, the Biden crime family has
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:35.760]  inherent interest in Ukraine because they've laundered a bunch of money out
[1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:42.560]  of there and continue to in the name of war. But it hasn't really gripped the
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:50.880]  American public. Russia is winning the war and it's kind of been a very clunky
[1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:57.240]  embarrassment for the Democrats trying to launch this war against Russia with no
[1:06:57.240 --> 1:07:05.920]  support from anywhere else. It's been very, very embarrassing actually. And so
[1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:11.160]  it's still going on. Russia is still winning and this was a story out of the
[1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:16.680]  express failure of leadership. American public ready to abandon Ukraine as
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:20.960]  trust in Biden plunges. Well, we've already sent $90 billion though, so we can't
[1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:24.360]  just abandon it. Although most of the money's already been laundered, stolen,
[1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.000]  the weapons being sold on the black market given to proxy armies and
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.720]  criminals and gangs. It's pretty typical. And so some of the numbers in here,
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:42.760]  sanctions hurt the U.S. more than Russia. More than 50% agreed. It's okay for the
[1:07:42.760 --> 1:07:49.840]  U.S. to let Ukraine lose more than 40% agreed. It'd be better to get Biden out
[1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:54.160]  of the White House than Putin out of the Kremlin more than 50% agreed. I mean,
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:08:05.080]  this is a pretty significant shift in the balance of public opinion when the
[1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:14.240]  average individual realizes that Biden is worse than Putin. That's a pretty big
[1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:19.760]  public opinion shift considering the levels of propaganda being waged
[1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:25.440]  against Putin and for Biden. The American people aren't buying it. They're
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.560]  suffering. Ukraine war frontline update. Citizens shelled. Ships stuck.
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:38.760]  Agriculture struggles. Yeah, Russia is winning the war in Ukraine. Here's
[1:08:38.760 --> 1:08:43.560]  another one. Turkey and Russia agree to demining operation in Ukrainian ports
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:50.080]  to erect grain corridor for days. The United Nations has been in unsuccessful
[1:08:50.080 --> 1:08:55.160]  talks on cobbling together an agreement on plans to unblock Black Sea grain
[1:08:55.160 --> 1:09:01.920]  exports from Ukrainian ports, including controversial discussions with Russia,
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:05.320]  which stood accused of weaponizing global food supply with its military
[1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:11.440]  blockade of key ports. Moscow has in turn charged that Ukraine said ports
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:16.920]  making tanker traffic impossible while also saying the West must ease
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:21.280]  sanctions if it hopes to get crucial grain exports flowing again. So again,
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:28.400]  it's another example of Russia winning. They are running the ports and then
[1:09:28.400 --> 1:09:31.640]  honestly the UN would have stopped the ports from operating anyway to try to
[1:09:31.640 --> 1:09:36.520]  hurt Russia. The problem is they don't control the ports. Ukraine lost that
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:43.120]  front. So Russia controls the ports now and they're in charge of the
[1:09:43.120 --> 1:09:52.560]  operations there. And they're using that as leverage because they're sick of
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:57.480]  being mistreated. And really that's not even it. Really they just wanted to
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:03.600]  save eastern Ukraine. But now because of what the globalists have done and
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:07.760]  more really it's just again it's really just America. NATO's kind of backed
[1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.080]  off. They sent some weapons in but that's about it. European countries have
[1:10:12.080 --> 1:10:17.400]  sent little financial support, little military support, not much. It's pretty
[1:10:17.400 --> 1:10:23.240]  much just been all America. So Russia just says, oh here you are, you dirty
[1:10:23.240 --> 1:10:29.200]  rotten criminals in Washington DC running proxy countries and proxy groups
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:32.840]  and proxy armies. Now it's in Ukraine. We're not going to take that. You think
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.960]  you can do that in Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria? Fine. Not in our backyard, not
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:46.000]  in Ukraine. And so what is European, what are European leaders doing? Not much.
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.800]  But Macron, he's being pressured. So what is Macron doing? Well he's going to
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:56.520]  issue a stern statement. Macron warns against humiliating Russia in Ukraine.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:11:07.600]  Now this is just hilarious. So this is either the Tokyo Rose pretending like
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:11.960]  Russia is getting embarrassed in Ukraine, pretending like Russia is losing in
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:24.080]  Ukraine, or this is Zelensky, or excuse me rather, this is Macron kind of letting
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:28.720]  the cat out of the bag that maybe they set a trap for Putin in Ukraine. And now
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:33.280]  he's saying, hey, we shouldn't spring that trap. It's going to be worse for the
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.920]  planet. So this is either Tokyo Rose because France isn't going to do
[1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:40.200]  anything for Ukraine. They don't really care. Their leaders aren't as stupid or
[1:11:40.200 --> 1:11:43.800]  corrupt as Joe Biden, I guess. So France is really not interested in anything
[1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:47.400]  going on in Ukraine, but they'll issue a statement, say, oh, let's, you know, we're
[1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:51.600]  dominating Russia. Let's not embarrass them any further. Like, okay, I guess that's
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:57.840]  your effort. Or he knows that there's been a trap set for Putin, and he's warning
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:02.760]  against actually springing it because of how bad it's gone so far. And then
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:07.080]  warnings flying everywhere here. Putin warns Ukraine against long-range
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:14.240]  missiles, and it's just, it's the U.S. shipping in the long-range missiles. And
[1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:21.760]  all that's happening is, I mean, some, Russia probably has informants on the
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:28.320]  inside because the shipments are coming in and Russians are bombing them. They're
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.000]  bombing them. They're bombing the containment facilities and the ships
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:37.360]  aren't making it out into port. So they're not even, a lot of these weapons that
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:40.680]  are going in aren't even making it. A lot of them are getting cut off and seized by
[1:12:40.680 --> 1:12:45.080]  Russia or just blown up by Russia. See, they're not telling you that, are they?
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:51.920]  No, no, no. Russia's losing, they tell you. And then there's Lindsey Graham. He's
[1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.960]  never seen a war. He didn't want someone else to die in. And he is just all over
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:00.360]  the Russia thing on his Twitter account. He's promoting, you need to go watch this
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:05.880]  documentary called, Navalny, a truly compelling documentary that every member
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:09.880]  of Congress should watch to understand Putin's Russia and the bravery of the
[1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:16.160]  Russian opposition forces. Oh, the bravery of Ukraine. Yes, yes. The bravery of Lindsey
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:24.680]  Graham, I'm sure. No, he's a, he's a Pinko Coward, a Warhawk. But hey, you know, I
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:31.480]  went and I checked Lindsey. Nothing on 2000 mules though. Nothing from Lindsey
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:36.320]  Graham on every member of Congress watching 2000 mules. He wants every
[1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:39.520]  member of Congress to know how bad Russia is because he probably has stock
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:43.080]  options in defense contractors and weapons manufacturers. So he's looking to
[1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:46.600]  make a couple million dollars off people dying. It's Lindsey Graham. He's a,
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:52.840]  he's a psychotic freak. And so he wants people to die for his profit. So he wants
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.960]  to demonize Russia. But anything on a U.S. elections being stolen from Lindsey
[1:13:56.960 --> 1:14:01.440]  Graham, should members of Congress watch 2000 mules, Lindsey Graham? No, I guess
[1:14:01.440 --> 1:14:04.880]  he can't profit off that. There's no bloodshed. So he's not interested in
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:09.720]  promoting that. Lindsey Graham, ladies and gentlemen. Lindsey Graham. U.S. issues,
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:15.080]  nuclear warning to North Korea. This is, this, this is just funny. This is the U.S.
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:19.120]  This is Biden getting embarrassed on the playground. Okay. This is the Biden
[1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:22.600]  administration getting mud smeared in their face and kicked to the ground and,
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:27.360]  and, and need and, and just embarrassed. And so they, they stand up and they go
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:30.920]  over to the smallest person on the playground. You know, they go over to the
[1:14:30.920 --> 1:14:34.120]  smallest little kid that has like a bunch of allergies, runny nose, just like
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:38.360]  hangs out under the jungle gym. And now they're going to go kick him and push
[1:14:38.360 --> 1:14:42.880]  him around. Like, oh, yeah. Look, I just got embarrassed on the playground. I'm
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:47.080]  going to go, I'm going to go push around the smallest guy I can find. It's like,
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:50.800]  look, we're getting embarrassed on the national stage. Look, Russia's embarrassing
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:54.640]  us. I know. Let's, let's go bark at North Korea. Yeah, I'll show them. Look how
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:15:02.280]  tough we are. Hey, North Korea. Real impressive. Ooh, ooh, you guys are, ooh,
[1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:07.800]  you're warning new North Korea. Ooh. Oh, you just went up. Oh, wow. You just went
[1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:14.840]  up in a kicked over a crippled kid. Oh, you're tough. You're tough. I'll make you
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:20.080]  a bet right now. I bet you North Korea test nuclear missiles again by the end
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:25.040]  of the summer. Now the US has said it's going to be a forceful response. I doubt
[1:15:25.040 --> 1:15:33.120]  it. I doubt that. But hey, guys, I mean, oh, boy, look out. Look out. We're oh,
[1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:38.080]  North Korea. Oh, yeah, North Korea. You better stop that. Like, hey, we're going
[1:15:38.080 --> 1:15:41.960]  to, we're going to, we're going to puff our chest out and act big towards China. Oh,
[1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.400]  wait, we don't do anything to China. We're going to puff our chest up and act big
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:48.360]  towards Russia. Oh, wait, Russia's winning the war. Oh, boy, we're really embarrassed
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:51.640]  here. I know. Let's go bark at North Korea. We'll look real tough then. We'll show
[1:15:51.640 --> 1:15:55.360]  the world. We'll show how strong the Biden administration. We'll go tell North Korea
[1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:57.000]  what's good. We'll show them what for.
[1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:03.080]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:06.960]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money Magazine
[1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:11.120]  have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns, 30
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:15.240]  different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers, and almost
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:19.800]  all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax
[1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:22.720]  groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:27.120]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:32.640]  with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:36.160]  things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.
[1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:40.160]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:46.720]  years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com,
[1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:55.360]  one word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.

[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:58.440]  how you keep us on air okay oh boy oh boy oh boy um let's go back here to Jean
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:05.320]  Pierre the black gay immigrant press secretary it's important you say that
[1:24:05.320 --> 1:24:08.240]  it's important the Democrats are obsessed with identity so it's very
[1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:12.720]  important because it's not about her accomplishments you know it's not about
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:16.880]  her credibility or anything it's about what color her skin is and her sexual
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:19.840]  preferences that's that's what's the most important so you have to make sure you
[1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:24.520]  say that before introducing you so this is the black lesbian immigrant press
[1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:28.800]  secretary Jean Pierre again folks it's hard for her to communicate because she
[1:24:28.800 --> 1:24:32.880]  only has a finite number of answers in front of her that's off a sheet it's like
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:35.880]  a low-program computer basically like a two-bit computer is what she is
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:42.120]  essentially and so here she is trying to prop up the lies of Joe Biden about
[1:24:42.120 --> 1:24:48.480]  how great the defense production act has been. What emergency is the president
[1:24:48.480 --> 1:24:52.240]  using to invoke the defense production act is historically it's been in the 1950s
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:56.720]  for the Korean War during COVID it was enacted what emergency is it or what's
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.800]  the real emergency in the solar industry for the defense production act? So let me
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:06.360]  I was gonna say first the president when he takes the defense production act is
[1:25:06.360 --> 1:25:10.480]  to make sure that he's delivering for the American people it is an important tool
[1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:16.520]  that he has used a couple of times and has been incredibly effective. So for
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:21.120]  this particular clean energy defense production act he's invoking the defense
[1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  production act to rapidly expand domestic production of solar panel parts
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:31.640]  building insulation heat pumps and more he is putting the full force of the
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:35.760]  federal government's purchasing power behind supporting American clean energy
[1:25:35.760 --> 1:25:41.120]  manufacturers and he is providing U.S. solar deployers the short-term
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:45.560]  stability they need to build clean energy projects and deliver more
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:50.360]  affordability energy to American families and business all together these
[1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:54.920]  historic action will cut costs for American families strengthen our power
[1:25:54.920 --> 1:25:59.840]  grid and tackle the climate crisis with a stronger clean energy arsenal the
[1:25:59.840 --> 1:26:04.080]  United States can be an even stronger partner to our allies especially in the
[1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:10.440]  face of Putin's war in Ukraine well this is just a step to get to to a place
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:15.040]  where we do have a clean energy arsenal and so this is a very important part of
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:23.600]  the president's agenda in getting to that clean energy system that he's
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:26.960]  been talking about since he walked into the administration so this is that and
[1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:31.600]  this is a way that we felt that we can act to get moving in that way come back
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:36.040]  up what was that she a little shimmy shake at the end you see that one
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:40.200]  wow she felt really good about herself she felt really good about reading off a
[1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:42.960]  cue card for a minute and a half that she did she felt so good she did a
[1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:50.000]  little oh like oh I did it like ah I mean it's almost as if we're being trained
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.640]  to accept a robot as the press secretary because I mean that's that's
[1:26:56.640 --> 1:27:00.260]  basically a robot I mean there's a finite number of responses it's all
[1:27:00.260 --> 1:27:04.200]  pre-programmed it's all just put into the code and then the robot just has to
[1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:09.360]  pick which scripted response it has for the question I mean that's that's that's
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:13.380]  Jean Pierre she gets a question she looks down at her cue card she reads off the
[1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:23.720]  cue cards wow she's essentially a 2-bit computer in a 16-bit world but notice
[1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:27.640]  the lies they don't stop lying again let's go back to the Biden statement that
[1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:31.000]  that she reiterates there she says the same thing they're both reading off the
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.400]  same script who's writing it for them is the question Biden says today I'm
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:40.720]  building on that progress progress they're making progress here destroying
[1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.440]  America I guess I'm building on that progress by authorizing the Defense
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:49.160]  Production Act to lower energy costs how's that going all the energy costs
[1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:53.280]  are going up but he says again lower them strengthen the power grid really
[1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:55.800]  were being warned about rolling blackouts all summer so I guess that's
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:28:01.040]  failing to good-paying jobs people can't afford rents anymore so I don't know
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:05.160]  where those are going and then Jean Pierre added another one tackle the
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:09.480]  climate crisis well what's the climate crisis well that's man-made climate
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:12.680]  change oh man made so what are you gonna do you're gonna tackle man down to the
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:17.800]  ground and end it but see notice how she doesn't answer the question what was
[1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:23.880]  the question the question was what emergency is going on right now for
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:31.520]  Biden to invoke such an act what emergency is going on right now for Biden to
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:36.920]  invoke the Defense Production Act well of course we know what the emergency is
[1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:42.600]  and we know why Jean Pierre didn't tell you what the emergency is because the
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:51.720]  emergency is Joe Biden the emergency is Democrat Party policies they are the
[1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:56.920]  emergency so now they're taking more power because of the emergency they
[1:28:56.920 --> 1:29:03.320]  cost the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was
[1:29:03.320 --> 1:29:07.040]  right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick
[1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:12.560]  feeling because I knew this was coming I tried to stop it and now everything I
[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:16.680]  talked about is gonna become more important than ever because the
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:21.920]  globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents it's now
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:27.400]  out on the open Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:32.880]  Bilderberg group founded Davos group so now the fights out in the open they're
[1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:36.400]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule we're gonna win
[1:29:36.400 --> 1:29:39.920]  this thing God's watching the children counting on us I just want to thank the
[1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:43.200]  viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial

[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.440]  depopulation is now out of the open everything you and I have done together
[1:30:12.440 --> 1:30:16.520]  has been distorted and we cannot continue in this fight without your

[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.720]  this is going to level the playing field everybody's going to have access to
[1:31:07.720 --> 1:31:10.360]  the same information everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that

[1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:16.000]  how gay they are do you think I could maybe like do you think that works in
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:20.480]  energy like maybe taking two male sockets and jamming them together do you
[1:34:20.480 --> 1:34:24.240]  think that would transfer energy or maybe two female sockets are putting you
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:27.120]  know both plus signs of the battery jamming them together you think that
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:33.200]  would work can you have gay batteries would that provide any energy no so I'm
[1:34:33.200 --> 1:34:40.080]  not sure why the energy department is so interested in how gay it is oh maybe
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:44.040]  this answers it pete butt judge maybe that's what it is it's pete butt judge in
[1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:49.680]  there we all know about his how he how he's so gay he's the gayest and he rides
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:55.200]  bicycles and so what is pete butt judge doing well I don't know folks but we've
[1:34:55.200 --> 1:35:01.400]  got horrifying news here any chances any chances we had of lowering energy costs
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:07.280]  are probably going downhill with this horrible news pete butt judge wants you
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:14.320]  to know he has tested positive for COVID-19 oh my oh no I think he's been
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:18.240]  boosted twice I think he's what is he a three injection three COVID-19 injection
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:23.320]  guy he's got COVID and he's experiencing mild symptoms oh oh he's got a tummy
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:26.640]  guys he's what's next you got a headache did you jam your toe well you get a
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:34.240]  little hangnail hmm get a little cough the running nose oh I plan to work
[1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:39.200]  remotely while isolating according to the CDC guidelines oh thank you thank you
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:44.080]  so much I was so concerned about that and look forward to when I can safely
[1:35:44.080 --> 1:35:51.960]  return to the office and the road oh my gosh I mean so noble I mean the honor
[1:35:51.960 --> 1:35:56.280]  and nobility of a pete butt judge I'm curious is he gonna be breastfeeding his
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:03.400]  babies while he's got COVID I you know how does that work well I guess we have
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:09.360]  more questions on that deal but so pete butt judge you don't even know what he
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:13.720]  does on a daily basis anyway wants you to know he's got COVID and he's got a
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.440]  little runny nose and so now every time somebody gets a cough I guess they have
[1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:20.820]  to let us know is that what this is about hey you need a couple days off
[1:36:20.820 --> 1:36:24.880]  work cuz you're sick take a couple days off work cuz you're sick but no you got
[1:36:24.880 --> 1:36:30.600]  to let everybody know all COVID I've got COVID what's more important the fear
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:36.280]  mongering over a virus or promoting the efficacy of the vaccines well we have
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:40.800]  our answer fear mongering over a virus because all these politicians that are
[1:36:40.800 --> 1:36:48.520]  multiple-time COVID-19 vaccine injectors are all getting COVID but they'd
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:55.360]  rather you be in fear of COVID than admit that the vaccines don't work and
[1:36:55.360 --> 1:37:01.200]  by the way they do want you living in fear I've got more news on that the
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:06.880]  monkey pox but what what what are we gonna be missing from Pete butt judge as
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:15.120]  he's out with COVID what could we possibly be missing oh Pete butt judge
[1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:21.080]  blaming everyone else Pete butt judge blames big oil ridiculously profitable
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:27.280]  for record high gas prices I mean this is such a lie folks so yeah do oil
[1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:31.440]  companies make a lot of money I don't think anybody denies that I don't think
[1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:36.280]  they deny that could you call them greedy perhaps but that's not what this is
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:43.720]  about the oil companies can't drill so you know they always talk about having a
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:47.720]  finite amount of oil what what are they used to call that in the 90s peak oil I
[1:37:47.720 --> 1:37:50.880]  think is what they called it there's the propaganda saying that you know we're
[1:37:50.880 --> 1:37:55.200]  gonna run out of oil well now that basically the Democrats have put us
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:38:00.760]  into that circumstance synthetically so so they've created a scarcity of energy
[1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:05.680]  and oil so of course price is gonna go up they've made it more expensive to
[1:38:05.680 --> 1:38:15.200]  transport and process the oil so of course prices are gonna go up so when
[1:38:15.200 --> 1:38:21.480]  they blame big oil they might as well just blame themselves what's the
[1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:29.480]  difference between now and two years ago why weren't prices this high two years
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:35.440]  ago big oil was still there big oil was still making record money big oil was
[1:38:35.440 --> 1:38:40.040]  still greedy big oil was still profitable why is the money so much now
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:45.520]  because Democrat Party policy that's why they've they've shut down drilling
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:49.840]  they've actually made scarcity in the oil markets and they and they tax you
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:57.320]  they tax you almost out of existence so no no big oil is not to blame for gas
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:02.440]  prices Democrat Party policy is so we're gonna be missing Pete Butt judge
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:06.680]  blaming everyone else for what he's done Biden officials admit Americans
[1:39:06.680 --> 1:39:12.960]  feeling the pain of inflation but still play that blame game yes they are the
[1:39:12.960 --> 1:39:18.200]  emergency but they say hey most robust recovery ever really that's what you call
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:22.760]  record inflation most robust recovery ever is record inflation interesting most
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:27.000]  robust recovery ever is record high gas prices energy prices very interesting
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:33.360]  most robust recovery ever is record high consumer price index increases most
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:39.400]  robust recovery ever Pete Butt judge says gas prices are not set by a dial in
[1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:44.760]  the White House really wow I had it all wrong that's how I thought it worked I
[1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:48.440]  thought Biden could just turn it down no instead he's turning it up but in a way
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:54.160]  it kind of is isn't it there is a dial it's called taxes it's called policy so
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:58.360]  in a way there is a dial so when you turn up the dial on taxes and when you
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:05.200]  turn down the dial on access what do you think happens well the gas prices turn
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:12.440]  up the dial the gas oil companies turn up the prices on the dial so really there
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:17.640]  is a dial in the White House but hey don't worry because the press secretary
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:24.900]  says hey it's worse in Europe it's worse in Europe guys White House tells
[1:40:24.900 --> 1:40:29.120]  Americans they have it better than Europeans on gas prices oh well you
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:32.120]  know what are they gonna tell you next hey you got it better than a Jew in
[1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:36.640]  Hitler's Germany am I right I mean hey yeah you don't know anything yeah you're
[1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:42.000]  living a pod with 16 smelly fat asses and and yeah you don't own anything yeah
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:47.080]  you have no privacy yeah you're poor but you got it better than a Jew in Nazi
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:52.040]  Germany I mean come on man hey I'm a Democrat I made your life better than a
[1:40:52.040 --> 1:40:59.080]  Jew in Nazi Germany thank you and you're welcome better than Europe they
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:06.120]  say better than Europe I don't know I mean that's a nice dance move from the
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:11.680]  black gay press secretary I mean she's really she's she feels good she was
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:17.320]  able to read off of her cue cards for 60 seconds straight without flummoxing that
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:23.040]  feels good for a moron for somebody that usually gets F's on tests when they
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:27.360]  get a B they feel really good about it and though they do a little dance they
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.320]  do a little they do a little they get in jiggy with it there better off than
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:36.520]  Europe they say what about the diversity how's that one working out Italy 30
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:41.600]  North African migrants sexually assault 16 girls on train to Milan folks this
[1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:44.560]  is one of the most disgusting stories you're ever going to read about her
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:50.440]  here white women don't come up here bunch of North Africans but hey it's their

[1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:09.040]  field everybody's gonna have access to the same information everybody's gonna
[1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:13.440]  be able to freely communicate that information that's our goal to get back
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:18.560]  to that place where we all have access to all the information we all have the

[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:36.640]  go after us because of the conversations we're having because of the internet
[1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:40.880]  searches that we're doing because of the the discussions the people we want to
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:45.320]  talk to about these things so that's our goal is to help people take back their

[1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:53.680]  we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening will check us out
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:47:01.560]  at boltowireless.com that's BOLTA wireless comm leading a frontal assault on
[1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:07.760]  the lives of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:56.540]  how far will it go indeed
[1:47:56.540 --> 1:48:06.660]  Biden's CDC says put the masks back on for monkeypox now remember the DOJ is
[1:48:06.660 --> 1:48:10.580]  trying to get mask mandates back why the DOJ would have anything to do with that
[1:48:10.580 --> 1:48:15.500]  is beyond anyone's comprehension but it's the Democrat Party everything is
[1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:20.180]  political and it's all about mandates and so mandates are one of their top
[1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:23.740]  things their Democrats their fascists their authoritarians they love their
[1:48:23.740 --> 1:48:31.980]  mandates and so they now want to start convincing people to wear a mask because
[1:48:31.980 --> 1:48:36.100]  of monkeypox they say if you're traveling you should wear a mask well
[1:48:36.100 --> 1:48:40.700]  everyone's traveling and then they say oh but see travelers should wear masks
[1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:44.940]  the official CDC statement because they've updated the monkeypox threat to
[1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:53.340]  level 2 now folks and so here's the official statement from the
[1:48:53.340 --> 1:48:59.020]  CDC travelers should wear a mask wearing a mask can help protect you from many
[1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:08.820]  diseases including monkeypox oh from many diseases ah yes yes you should live
[1:49:08.820 --> 1:49:15.060]  in fear forever you should always live in fear your life should be dominated by
[1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:23.900]  fear but don't worry we'll have mandates to mitigate your fear ah yes oh any
[1:49:23.900 --> 1:49:31.140]  diseases oh hey oh yeah I mean I think you should probably wear a helmet because
[1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:35.100]  you might run into a you know a post or you know a light pole or something you
[1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:39.220]  should probably wear a helmet a rock might fall from the sky I mean God
[1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:44.740]  forbid a shrapnel from a meteor strike you in the head you might not have a
[1:49:44.740 --> 1:49:50.220]  helmet on there's inherent risk wear a helmet I mean you could trip in one of
[1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:54.020]  these democrat cities where they can't even pave a road potholes everywhere you
[1:49:54.020 --> 1:49:58.260]  could trip in a democrat pothole and you could scuff your knee up pretty bad you
[1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:04.980]  should probably wear wearing knee pads too this is serious stuff so I mean
[1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:13.380]  that's the new democrat voter face mask 24 7 helmet 24 7 knee pads 24 7 probably a
[1:50:13.380 --> 1:50:18.340]  hazmat suit on top of all of it but see that's why they're all falling for the
[1:50:18.340 --> 1:50:22.620]  propaganda that's why they're all convinced the the answer to this planet
[1:50:22.620 --> 1:50:27.020]  the answer to life that they're so afraid of is to just sit in a pot all day
[1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:36.980]  and eat bugs and watch Netflix and their biggest problem is that most people don't
[1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:40.940]  like that most people actually like life most people like the challenges the
[1:50:40.940 --> 1:50:49.340]  obstacles the victories the defeat the triumphs the experiences the risks the
[1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:55.860]  loving the losing all of it we like it we like life but see that's the new
[1:50:55.860 --> 1:51:01.460]  world order they want you to hate life so that they can make you a good obedient
[1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:09.940]  slave so let's see how many cases of monkeypox does it take to get to a
[1:51:09.940 --> 1:51:16.180]  level to alert well I'll tell you 31 31 cases of monkeypox there's probably 31
[1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:21.460]  cases of monkeypox in the average north african country every day every day and
[1:51:21.460 --> 1:51:28.060]  by the way they can treat it I'm not saying you want to get it but I mean it's
[1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:33.980]  not the 99.99% survival rate of COVID but you know wear your mask wear your
[1:51:33.980 --> 1:51:37.780]  hazmat suit wear your knee pads wear your helmet you should probably just walk
[1:51:37.780 --> 1:51:41.220]  around with a condom on all the time to you know you never know you never know
[1:51:41.220 --> 1:51:44.740]  you may get raped in a Democrat city at any time so just as a matter of
[1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:50.060]  protection probably wear a condom and you know what I mean you might just want
[1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:53.980]  to I mean you know if you have a little child with you they may actually need to
[1:51:53.980 --> 1:51:56.660]  learn this now we're in the Democrats America five years ago this would be
[1:51:56.660 --> 1:51:59.740]  inappropriate for children but we're in Democrat America now you may also want
[1:51:59.740 --> 1:52:04.020]  to walk around with a butt plug because for multiple reasons you can stop
[1:52:04.020 --> 1:52:09.260]  somebody from raping you from behind happens in Democrat cities and more
[1:52:09.260 --> 1:52:12.900]  importantly though you'll stop your carbon emissions and you'll plug up that
[1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:17.980]  that carbon emissions about on your back end and so you know I mean look we're
[1:52:17.980 --> 1:52:23.300]  just looking out for the environment here and this is liberal logic and plus
[1:52:23.300 --> 1:52:28.540]  doing something like that you're standing in solidarity with the homosexual
[1:52:28.540 --> 1:52:34.580]  community so I mean if you're not walking around you know with with with some
[1:52:34.580 --> 1:52:40.340]  sort of gay sex toy are you really doing anything for the homosexual community
[1:52:40.340 --> 1:52:46.060]  in this gay pride month are you really an ally are you really an activist wear
[1:52:46.060 --> 1:52:50.740]  that mask for monkey pox folks but here's a doctor that tells the truth
[1:52:50.740 --> 1:52:56.380]  dr. Simone gold masks don't stop viruses it turns out they're actually
[1:52:56.380 --> 1:53:02.980]  harmful that's right that's right and we knew that already but Democrats never
[1:53:02.980 --> 1:53:06.160]  saw a mandate they didn't want to promote and so they brought you the mask
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:10.060]  mandate that did nothing and they're gonna bring it back oh they're going to
[1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:16.380]  bring that mask mandate back and I say go for it I say go for it you know what
[1:53:16.380 --> 1:53:22.460]  at this point the Democrats might as well just show their full ass they might
[1:53:22.460 --> 1:53:25.780]  as well just show they might just take the mask off I mean look they're already
[1:53:25.780 --> 1:53:29.100]  telling us they don't believe in the Bill of Rights they don't believe in the
[1:53:29.100 --> 1:53:36.940]  Constitution your your rights are not set in stone how did Biden say it not
[1:53:36.940 --> 1:53:40.300]  absolute your rights are not absolute so they're coming out telling you they're
[1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:43.220]  they're openly traitors they're openly treasonous they don't believe in the
[1:53:43.220 --> 1:53:45.420]  Bill of Rights they don't believe in the Constitution something they sworn oath
[1:53:45.420 --> 1:53:51.500]  to and they love mandates they love medical mandates which is essentially
[1:53:51.500 --> 1:53:56.660]  fascism and that's what it's all about and so I'm glad they're taking off their
[1:53:56.660 --> 1:54:00.460]  mask I'm glad they're showing us who they are and go ahead bring back the
[1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:05.220]  mask mandates please and let's see more medical mandates from you guys to just
[1:54:05.220 --> 1:54:09.700]  keep destroying people's lives just keep destroying our freedoms just keep
[1:54:09.700 --> 1:54:15.020]  showing America who you really are please please we've known who you are
[1:54:15.020 --> 1:54:19.820]  it's time for the rest of the people to understand and then they mandated that
[1:54:19.820 --> 1:54:25.380]  vaccine and I'm sure it has nothing to do with this dental nurse 24 years old
[1:54:25.380 --> 1:54:31.580]  died from sudden adult death syndrome went to sleep never woke up this is the
[1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:38.540]  new thing folks sudden adult death syndrome sudden adult death syndrome
[1:54:38.540 --> 1:54:48.900]  yes it's called cover-up from a vaccine death now is that every case is that this
[1:54:48.900 --> 1:54:53.260]  girl's case will probably never know because people don't want to be honest
[1:54:53.260 --> 1:54:59.620]  about the deadly vaccines the COVID-19 vaccines but you can go right to the
[1:54:59.620 --> 1:55:04.340]  vaccine adverse reaction website and you will find official government data
[1:55:04.340 --> 1:55:10.660]  that so far about 33,000 people have died from the COVID-19 vaccine that's
[1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:18.380]  official government data more than 30,000 people have died from the COVID-19
[1:55:18.380 --> 1:55:23.820]  vaccine guess what that's more people that have died from gun violence wow
[1:55:23.820 --> 1:55:29.540]  should we ban vaccines I mean come on now let's go with the Democrat Party
[1:55:29.540 --> 1:55:36.620]  logic so because people die from gun violence we ban guns so because people
[1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:40.860]  die from vaccines we should buy we should ban vaccines vaccines kill more
[1:55:40.860 --> 1:55:45.940]  than guns now with the COVID vaccine it's not even close 30,000 plus dead from
[1:55:45.940 --> 1:55:50.060]  COVID vaccines we should ban COVID vaccines well of course we should
[1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:56.340]  ban the COVID poison vaccine we've known that since day one but I'm just
[1:55:56.340 --> 1:56:03.460]  using liberal logic here if gun violence kills people and we want to ban guns
[1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:06.700]  even though we have a right to it well why aren't you banning the COVID vaccine
[1:56:06.700 --> 1:56:12.300]  that kills more people than guns why aren't you doing that why aren't you
[1:56:12.300 --> 1:56:18.380]  doing that oh that's right because you promoted it you promoted that medical
[1:56:18.380 --> 1:56:25.860]  fascism you promoted that medical mandate that killed 30,000 plus people
[1:56:25.860 --> 1:56:35.220]  that's why that's why now here's another interesting story miracle drug shows
[1:56:35.220 --> 1:56:43.020]  1,000 excuse me 100% remission for all cancer patients during drug trial a
[1:56:43.020 --> 1:56:47.460]  potential numerical cancer treatment resulted in remission for every patient
[1:56:47.460 --> 1:56:54.620]  enrolled in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and that
[1:56:54.620 --> 1:56:59.820]  place may suddenly burn to the ground you know what I mean hey I think we got a
[1:56:59.820 --> 1:57:04.500]  plan to cure cancer and then all the sudden a fire breaks out at the

[2:00:27.900 --> 2:00:33.460]  chalkboard Democrat party policy and so let's see here gas prices energy price
[2:00:33.460 --> 2:00:37.700]  index it's all it's all on the rise post Biden there's no denying it no it's not
[2:00:37.700 --> 2:00:44.220]  rush it's Biden it's the Democrats but here's um here's your gay energy
[2:00:44.220 --> 2:00:47.860]  secretary you have to say he's gay don't be a bigot it's pride month now so let's
[2:00:47.860 --> 2:00:52.580]  make sure everybody knows how gay Pete Butt judge is very important no I'm not
[2:00:52.580 --> 2:00:58.260]  being bigoted I'm being an ally gay butt judge the energy secretary it's pride
[2:00:58.260 --> 2:01:05.500]  month gay butt judge here's him you know answering the question hey how come all
[2:01:05.500 --> 2:01:08.820]  the energy prices are skyrocketing since Biden got into office here's gay
[2:01:08.820 --> 2:01:13.740]  butt judge Americans feel gas prices just about more than anything else we're
[2:01:13.740 --> 2:01:18.140]  seeing $5 a gallon approaching $5 a gallon across the country right now as
[2:01:18.140 --> 2:01:22.380]  we head into the summer vacation season earlier this year the president tap the
[2:01:22.380 --> 2:01:25.380]  strategic petroleum reserves hadn't hasn't made any difference at all was
[2:01:25.380 --> 2:01:30.740]  that a failure well look I don't think it's correct to say it hasn't made any
[2:01:30.740 --> 2:01:34.980]  difference at all this is an action that helped to stabilize global oil prices
[2:01:34.980 --> 2:01:38.460]  the action the president took around ethanol introducing additional
[2:01:38.460 --> 2:01:42.300]  flexibility there that's having an effect on prices in the Midwest but we
[2:01:42.300 --> 2:01:48.620]  also know that the price of gasoline is not set by a dial in the Oval Office can
[2:01:48.620 --> 2:01:56.820]  you believe what he just said he said Biden releasing America's strategic oil
[2:01:56.820 --> 2:02:03.140]  reserves balanced oil prices on a global scale now why would he say something
[2:02:03.140 --> 2:02:07.300]  like that I thought it was all about America folks they had that Biden has
[2:02:07.300 --> 2:02:12.580]  almost drained half of our strategic oil reserves I think it's 40% now so we
[2:02:12.580 --> 2:02:16.580]  have 60% oil reserves that we had when Biden got in office they'll probably
[2:02:16.580 --> 2:02:25.580]  release more this summer most of that oil went overseas most of that oil went
[2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:32.500]  to Europe and then they still lie and they say well it's it's helped balance
[2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:35.740]  the prices really because Europe has the highest gas prices they've ever had to
[2:02:35.740 --> 2:02:40.460]  so where where is the balancing here where where where gas prices going down
[2:02:40.460 --> 2:02:45.460]  where is any victory from releasing the strategic oil reserves there is none
[2:02:45.460 --> 2:02:51.580]  but judge is a liar and he says oh there's no dial in the Oval Office yeah
[2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:58.540]  actually there is you turn up the dial on taxes and regulation which increases
[2:02:58.540 --> 2:03:04.900]  the price you turn down the dial on access which increases the price so yeah
[2:03:04.900 --> 2:03:11.220]  there are dials in the White House but Pete Buttigieg is a Democrat so
[2:03:11.220 --> 2:03:16.140]  therefore he's a liar and now here's the arrogance of the Democrats here's a
[2:03:16.140 --> 2:03:21.700]  Democrat again it's it's so incredible how detached they are from reality and
[2:03:21.700 --> 2:03:27.780]  how insensitive they are when they make comments like this in front of Congress
[2:03:27.780 --> 2:03:33.660]  in clip 15 I do have to say just on the issue of gas prices after waiting for a
[2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:37.900]  long time to have enough chips in this country to finally get my electric
[2:03:37.900 --> 2:03:44.060]  vehicle I got it and drove it from Michigan to here this last weekend and
[2:03:44.060 --> 2:03:48.300]  went by every single gas station and didn't matter how high it was and so I'm
[2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:51.620]  looking forward to the opportunity for us to move to vehicles that aren't going
[2:03:51.620 --> 2:03:58.580]  to be dependent on the whims of the oil companies and the international markets
[2:03:58.580 --> 2:04:02.940]  the whims of the oil companies now again it's the whims of the Democrats it's
[2:04:02.940 --> 2:04:09.160]  Democrat party policy God please free me from these damn team
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:13.540]  these Democrats are all such lying scumbags when you're just crushing us
[2:04:13.540 --> 2:04:19.140]  but see so oh she says oh I've had to knit I've had to scratch and claw my
[2:04:19.140 --> 2:04:23.180]  entire how old is Debbie Stamina 70 years old I've had to scratch and claw my
[2:04:23.180 --> 2:04:26.180]  entire life to finally be able to afford a fifty sixty thousand dollar
[2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:29.940]  electric vehicle and then I'm gonna rub it in America's face is saying huh you
[2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:35.100]  can't afford gas prices why don't you get yourself an electric car well let's
[2:04:35.100 --> 2:04:40.780]  see I can't afford five dollars a gallon gasoline I can't afford a hundred
[2:04:40.780 --> 2:04:44.940]  dollars to fill my tank so I'll go out and buy a fifty thousand dollar vehicle
[2:04:44.940 --> 2:04:50.300]  bill that must be Democrat liberal logic but they rub it in your they've rub it
[2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:54.380]  just go get an electric vehicle let them eat cake
[2:04:54.380 --> 2:05:02.620]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer
[2:05:02.620 --> 2:05:06.500]  a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine
[2:05:06.500 --> 2:05:10.660]  have all done these profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns
[2:05:10.660 --> 2:05:14.980]  30 different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost
[2:05:14.980 --> 2:05:19.260]  all of them just screw you over especially the big firms and the big
[2:05:19.260 --> 2:05:22.500]  tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[2:05:22.500 --> 2:05:26.420]  public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important situation
[2:05:26.420 --> 2:05:32.380]  with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do
[2:05:32.380 --> 2:05:36.060]  things tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep money we
[2:05:36.060 --> 2:05:39.940]  wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few
[2:05:39.940 --> 2:05:46.300]  years the only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com
[2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:56.900]  one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285-833-904-285
[2:06:02.380 --> 2:06:07.900]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report if you are
[2:06:07.900 --> 2:06:16.780]  receiving this transmission you are the resistance and now your host Owen shroyer
[2:06:38.660 --> 2:06:46.700]  by the way I was not kidding some of the crew thought I was joking I thought it
[2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:50.620]  was some kind of a ruse but the crew went and investigated I don't have my
[2:06:50.620 --> 2:06:53.580]  research in front of me it's sitting on my office desk I wasn't even going to
[2:06:53.580 --> 2:06:57.300]  cover it because it's so crazy but maybe I will maybe later on the war room but
[2:06:57.300 --> 2:07:04.860]  no what was the guy's name guys forget the guy's name you get saw say it one
[2:07:04.860 --> 2:07:10.460]  more time for me Aaron Salter so there's Aaron Salter he was working on
[2:07:10.460 --> 2:07:14.780]  developing an engine that could run on water here's some of his videos that
[2:07:14.780 --> 2:07:17.460]  were on the internet he'd been interviewed by local news multiple times
[2:07:17.460 --> 2:07:21.500]  special news reports on it and everything and he just happened to be in the
[2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:28.100]  Buffalo supermarket that day where a individual drove 300 miles to go commit
[2:07:28.100 --> 2:07:36.780]  a mass shooting that day this guy had patents and everything so think what you
[2:07:36.780 --> 2:07:41.820]  want of that what are the odds of that so no I was not that was not a ruse that
[2:07:41.820 --> 2:07:49.620]  was not a joke I was dead serious I mean what are the odds of that folks so
[2:07:49.620 --> 2:07:58.820]  there you go I mean you want to talk about attacking big oil mm-hmm but anyway
[2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:02.940]  anyway these are just some of the oddities these are just some of the
[2:08:02.940 --> 2:08:08.820]  craziness some of the craziness we experience here pretty wild here's
[2:08:08.820 --> 2:08:12.260]  another one remember I believe it was Vince Foster you guys remember Vince
[2:08:12.260 --> 2:08:17.460]  Foster guys plug Vince Foster into a search engine here I believe it was
[2:08:17.460 --> 2:08:21.060]  Vince Foster was the individual who former Clinton associate who somehow
[2:08:21.060 --> 2:08:27.500]  managed to chop himself up into pieces and then put himself into a duffle bag
[2:08:27.500 --> 2:08:32.340]  and then even and then even after he chopped himself into tiny pieces and
[2:08:32.340 --> 2:08:36.220]  got into a duffle bag he was then able to transport himself hundreds of miles
[2:08:36.220 --> 2:08:41.260]  Vince Foster I believe was his name incredible stuff Clinton associates are
[2:08:41.260 --> 2:08:46.100]  able to accomplish while committing suicide I mean just unbelievable features
[2:08:46.100 --> 2:08:53.940]  that we're witnessing here from Clinton associates yes there it is right there
[2:08:53.940 --> 2:09:02.180]  yes he he chopped himself up into pieces he first he killed himself then he
[2:09:02.180 --> 2:09:06.780]  chopped himself into pieces then he climbed into a duffle bag and then he
[2:09:06.780 --> 2:09:13.060]  relocated his rotting corpse pieces to a park a couple hundred miles away it
[2:09:13.060 --> 2:09:17.860]  makes sense it makes sense and so here's another one another Clinton
[2:09:17.860 --> 2:09:24.020]  associate family of Bill Clinton advisor who admitted Jeffrey Epstein into
[2:09:24.020 --> 2:09:29.380]  White House seven times has his blocked has blocked release of files detailing
[2:09:29.380 --> 2:09:33.180]  the death scene after he was found hanging from a tree with a shotgun
[2:09:33.180 --> 2:09:38.220]  blast at a ranch 30 miles from his home top Clinton advisor Mark Middleton died
[2:09:38.220 --> 2:09:44.460]  by suicide at the age of 59 the Perry County Sheriff's Office in Arkansas has
[2:09:44.460 --> 2:09:50.060]  confirmed another Arkansas Middleton was President Bill Clinton special
[2:09:50.060 --> 2:09:53.820]  advisor who admitted Jeffrey Epstein to the White House seven of the at least
[2:09:53.820 --> 2:09:59.940]  17 times the pedophile visited Clinton the married father of two who lived in
[2:09:59.940 --> 2:10:05.340]  Little Rock Arkansas shot himself at the ranch 30 miles from his house so so did
[2:10:05.340 --> 2:10:08.460]  he shoot himself before he hung himself to the hung himself before he shot
[2:10:08.460 --> 2:10:12.660]  himself I don't know it's fun did Vince Foster chop himself up before after he
[2:10:12.660 --> 2:10:15.760]  killed himself that he hopped into the double bag and then kill himself did he
[2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:18.980]  get in the duffle bag and then and then chop himself up and then kill himself
[2:10:18.980 --> 2:10:23.180]  did Vince Foster get in the duffle bag chop himself up crawl hundreds of miles
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:26.880]  to a park in Washington and then kill himself now what about Mark Middleton
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:31.920]  did he did he hang himself and then shoot himself with a shotgun did he shoot
[2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:40.480]  himself with the shotgun and then hang himself, just amazing stuff. Always the Clinton associates.
[2:10:40.480 --> 2:10:49.040]  Always. And they say, I mean, it's just, it's too good to be true. The two filed the family.
[2:10:49.040 --> 2:10:53.880]  Daily Mail can reveal now Middleton's father Larry and his widow Ray are fighting to keep
[2:10:53.880 --> 2:10:58.600]  photos and other illustrative content of his death sealed. The two filed for an injection
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:04.560]  arguing that blocking the release of the footage would halt a proliferation of unsubstantiated
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:11.600]  conspiracy theories. Yes, making sure nobody knows about the next Clinton associate that
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:17.440]  somehow committed suicide in a wild fashion, making sure that you block that information.
[2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:27.640]  That's going to stop conspiracy theories. That's going to stop it. So and the county
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:34.360]  has denied FOIA requests for any paperwork on the case. I'm sure that will also help conspiracy
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:47.760]  theories. So what's weirder? The fact that an individual supposedly is about to make an
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:52.320]  engine that runs on water, get shot in a mass shooting where an individual travels 300 miles
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:56.520]  to go to that supermarket in particular. Maybe it's Vince Foster chopping himself up,
[2:11:56.520 --> 2:12:00.480]  crawling into a duffel bag, shooting himself in the head and then crawling hundreds of miles
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:05.760]  before being discovered. Or maybe it's Mark Middleton, one of Clinton's top associates who
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:11.800]  ushered Jeffrey Epstein into the White House multiple times. Was a concierge, if you will,
[2:12:11.800 --> 2:12:19.160]  for Jeffrey Epstein, the industrial level sex trafficker to Bill Clinton and how he somehow
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:23.640]  hung himself and shot himself at the same time. And then you're not going to hear or see anything
[2:12:23.640 --> 2:12:27.520]  about that because it's all being covered up and they say this will stop conspiracy theories
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:39.120]  from spreading. Crazy, crazy times. Crazy times indeed. And now here's the latest. Nude Hunter
[2:12:39.120 --> 2:12:45.840]  Biden cavorts with Hooker illegal gun in latest mess for president. Mess? Are you kidding?
[2:12:45.840 --> 2:12:51.240]  What mess? This mess is going to be, this mess is cleaned up before it barely even spreads.
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:55.040]  This mess is covered by the media. They're not going to cover Hunter Biden's gun crimes.
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:13:01.000]  So let's see here. Oh, the party that's all about gun control. Let's see here. Hunter
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:08.440]  Biden lied on federal documents to get a gun. He then also had an illegal firearm that
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:15.520]  he ditched in a dumpster behind a schoolyard. How's that for gun control from the Biden
[2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:23.280]  crime family? Lies on federal documents also has illegal firearms, ditches them in dumpsters
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:30.240]  outside of children's playgrounds. Secret service covers all of it up. Now you've got
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:37.800]  Hunter Biden who films himself having porn with what many say appear to be minors or
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:44.400]  family members and then he sends his porn to his dad. Hunter Biden sends his porn to
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:52.280]  his father. And now you've got new photos with Hunter Biden brandishing a firearm with
[2:13:52.280 --> 2:13:57.440]  hookers and drugs. Why is Hunter Biden always naked with hookers and drugs? What is the
[2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:07.520]  deal with that? I mean, look, if you've had one instance in your life where you're naked
[2:14:07.520 --> 2:14:13.080]  getting photoed with hookers and drugs and guns, then you've probably had one wild night.
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:20.320]  My guess is 99.99% of people probably have never had a night where they're brandishing
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:28.120]  firearms naked of using drugs and hookers, let alone being filmed or photographed while
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:34.040]  that's going on. But apparently this is commonplace for Hunter Biden. Is this before or after
[2:14:34.040 --> 2:14:46.360]  he smokes the Parmesan cheese? It's just, it's really amazing, isn't it? And it's not
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:53.280]  about what about ism. It's showing the double standard. It's showing the corruption. It's
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:57.960]  showing the hypocrisy. I don't like doing the, well, what if it was Trump? But I mean, let's
[2:14:57.960 --> 2:15:04.280]  be honest. If Trump had 50 associates that committed suicide with crazy stories like
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:08.040]  Vince Foster and Mark Middleton, what do you think the media would make a big deal of that?
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:12.120]  Do you think they'd be saying, hey, he's like some mafia criminal boss having people off?
[2:15:12.120 --> 2:15:17.680]  Do you think so? But with the Clintons, you don't talk about it. What about if, what about
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:27.480]  if Don Trump Jr. was making porn, ordering hookers, abusing drugs, videotaping it, filming
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:29.920]  it, all this stuff? Do you think the media would cover that? Do you think they'd make
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:35.280]  a big fuss out of it? By the way, it just came out. One of Hunter Biden's hookers, this
[2:15:35.280 --> 2:15:42.600]  is folks, one of Hunter Biden's hookers got a PP money or whatever from the Biden administration.
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:48.080]  Tens of thousands of dollars. Joe Biden's administration literally gave tens of thousands
[2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:54.640]  of dollars taxpayer dollars to Hunter Biden's hookers. Again, should I say it? Imagine if
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:16:05.320]  it was Trump? Freeworldoutlet.com. That is a very important URL for info or supporters

[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:17.320]  many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez. How many people have just
[2:19:17.320 --> 2:19:22.560]  been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones including myself. I've been
[2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:27.200]  given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and I would
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:31.400]  probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones. I mean I've
[2:19:31.400 --> 2:19:36.240]  been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass

[2:03:41.120 --> 2:20:48.760]  response to a shooting. Something they mimicked from Nazi Germany is they put
[2:20:48.760 --> 2:20:56.760]  a bunch of shoes out on the lawn of the Capitol to show victims I guess to show supporters
[2:20:56.760 --> 2:21:02.520]  of gun control and it didn't really fill it up but a bunch of people left their shoes.
[2:21:02.520 --> 2:21:09.320]  No the original stunt or the original illustration rather was done by Jews that were killed by
[2:21:09.320 --> 2:21:17.680]  Nazis. Shoes left by victims of gun control. Nazi Germany 1945. So sorry liberals, sorry
[2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:26.640]  democrats, the victims of gun control outnumber, outnumber there the victims of gun violence
[2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:32.600]  and it's really not even close. Ask the Chinese under Mao Zedong. Ask the Jews under Hitler.
[2:21:32.600 --> 2:21:38.960]  Ask the Cambodians under Pol Pot. The list goes on and on but that's the left. That's
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:45.520]  the leftist ideology. It's all about control and then ultimately it's all about mass death.
[2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:50.440]  That's where the leftist ideology always leads to in case you haven't figured that out yet.
[2:21:50.440 --> 2:21:55.280]  Here's an example. California number one in gun control, number one in active shooter
[2:21:55.280 --> 2:22:04.200]  incidents. How's gun control working for California? Not so hot, not so well. Here's a map of
[2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:09.600]  what's happened in California in the last 40 years and on the left what you see is that
[2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:17.760]  California was a red state in 1980. A red state. California was doing awfully well in
[2:22:17.760 --> 2:22:24.480]  the 1980s by the way. Doing really well in the 1980s. Very prosperous state. And what
[2:22:24.480 --> 2:22:28.640]  has happened since? Well since slowly but surely the democrats have taken control of
[2:22:28.640 --> 2:22:35.480]  California and now it's one of the worst states to live in. People are fleeing the hellhole
[2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:44.080]  that is blue California. Now the question that begs asking here is well are these legitimate
[2:22:44.080 --> 2:22:49.240]  election results? Are our democrats legitimately taking over the state despite destroying it
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:55.400]  the entire time? Or is it rigged elections? Well I don't know but we can clearly see that
[2:22:55.400 --> 2:23:03.080]  as California went more blue, went more democrat, it also went more into a hellhole situation.
[2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:09.240]  And one of the candidates running against Gavin Newsom is Michael Schellenberger and
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:16.200]  he's sharing some of the data. Drug overdose and poisoning deaths have doubled since the
[2:23:16.200 --> 2:23:21.720]  election of Governor Gavin Newsom in 2018 and yet he refuses to shut down the open air
[2:23:21.720 --> 2:23:26.360]  drug markets in our cities. As governor I will shut down the open air markets that are
[2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:29.680]  killing our people and ruining our cities and then he shows the graph here you can see.
[2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:35.840]  It literally has gone from 6,000 drug overdose deaths in California to 12,000 since they
[2:23:35.840 --> 2:23:40.000]  implemented things like the safe needle program. And remember they said oh we're not giving
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:45.640]  drug paraphernalia to citizens? Yeah they are folks. Yeah they are. Not only are they giving
[2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:50.640]  them drug paraphernalia, they're giving them what they call safe spaces to go use and abuse
[2:23:50.640 --> 2:24:02.200]  drugs. Safe drug use doubles the death. You think that's by accident? Let me ask you,
[2:24:02.200 --> 2:24:07.520]  do you think it's by accident that democrats encourage deadly drug use and then facilitate
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:12.280]  it and then they double the drug overdose death? Do you think that's by accident? Do
[2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:18.080]  you think that's a mistake? Or could someone have maybe reached the logic of if you're
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:23.560]  going to poison yourself to death, let me just fast track that process for you. Which
[2:24:23.560 --> 2:24:27.080]  one do you think it is? Do you think democrats are intentionally getting people to overdose
[2:24:27.080 --> 2:24:30.920]  on drugs or do you think they're getting people to overdose on drugs accidentally? Which one
[2:24:30.920 --> 2:24:35.360]  is it? Are democrats intentionally killing people or accidentally killing people? You
[2:24:35.360 --> 2:24:42.240]  decide. Here's some more examples. Drug deaths and shoplifting have skyrocketed since their
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:49.040]  decriminalization in 2014 but Newsome refuses to restore penalties for either not even mandatory
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:56.000]  rehab and psychiatric care. Percent of shoplifting cases ending in arrest in San Francisco has
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:25:06.480]  gone from 60% in 2014 to now 15%. 15%. Oh, let's see. If criminals know the odds of
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:13.320]  them not getting arrested or getting away with a crime are better than 50%, do you think
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:20.720]  they're going to want to commit crimes? Absolutely. And if it's 15% of a percent of punishing after
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:24.840]  you commit a crime, do you think they're going to increase committing crimes? Well, of course.
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:30.000]  So not only is the number, not only is the percentage of arrests for criminal activity
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  going down, not only is that going down, the number of crimes is also going up. So you're
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:47.280]  getting the old double team there by the democrats, the old double team. But see, it's a complete
[2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:52.680]  disaster. Chesa Baudin and the limits of San Francisco liberalism. Folks, this is actually
[2:25:52.680 --> 2:26:03.320]  one of the wildest things. Chesa Baudin. Okay. Do you know who Chesa Baudin's mother is?
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:11.600]  Oh, she was just a member of the democrat leftist group called the weather underground
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:20.120]  that engaged in domestic terrorism like burning buildings to the ground. Yeah, that was the
[2:26:20.120 --> 2:26:23.800]  mother. I don't even believe this, honestly. And I've gone back and looked at this over
[2:26:23.800 --> 2:26:30.280]  and over and I still don't even believe it. So the the radical democrat terrorist, who
[2:26:30.280 --> 2:26:35.080]  by the way, got released from jail and got a teaching job at Columbia University. Democrats,
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:40.600]  liberals always protect their own, even if they're murderous terrorists, cop killers.
[2:26:40.600 --> 2:26:45.480]  She ended up getting paid as a professor at Columbia. And then am I really supposed to
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:51.920]  sit here and believe that the son of that woman that known terrorist is now the San Francisco
[2:26:51.920 --> 2:26:56.960]  district attorney? Am I really in that much of a twilight zone? Have democrats really
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:06.440]  gone that terrorist? It's just and then it is. I mean, it's mind blowing, but it's true.
[2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:11.720]  And these are the people that are facilitating crime in democrat cities. They're criminals
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:19.080]  themselves or they come from criminal bloodlines. You can't even believe it, but it's true.
[2:27:19.080 --> 2:27:22.000]  You can't even believe it, but it's true. Yeah, you want to know why San Francisco is
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:28.360]  such a hellhole? Democrats, that's why. And and you remember the story about the New York
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:34.440]  democrat attorneys that got caught firebombing during the liberal summer of rage in 2020?
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:42.800]  You remember that? Remember them? Well, their case was finished and they had reached a deal
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:49.560]  and they were facing up to 30 years in prison. And then the department, the Biden department
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:54.080]  of justice decided they were just going to inject themselves into this. No, no request,
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:28:00.200]  no reasoning, no, no, no standard, no precedent. They just they just voluntarily inject themselves
[2:28:00.200 --> 2:28:06.480]  into this. And they're going to make sure that those two democrat terrorists, those lawyers,
[2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:11.040]  Colin Ford, Mattis and Ooraj, ramen, they're going to make sure they don't see any jail
[2:28:11.040 --> 2:28:21.640]  time at all or very little amount of jail time. Is that not unbelievable? I'm just,
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:28.440]  you can't believe it, folks. You can't believe it. The Biden DOJ steps in to bail out democrat
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:34.640]  terrorists because, see, it's all about promoting democrat violence. That's what it's all about.
[2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:39.360]  It's all about letting their terrorists know that when you commit crimes, we will have
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:43.960]  your back. But where are the republicans on all the political prisoners of the democrat
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:49.640]  party rotting in jails right now that are completely innocent or did victimless crimes?
[2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:52.880]  Where are the republicans on that? Nowhere. Meanwhile, democrats are bailing out known
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:59.120]  terrorists and murderers. I want to take a minute out to address the
[2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:04.160]  viewers and listeners of M4 Wars and to remind you that we've been vindicated and that world

[2:31:56.360 --> 2:32:06.480]  If I had to describe with just one word the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:13.080]  prince, but the general public is in. The best word would actually be the people are
[2:32:13.080 --> 2:32:19.160]  lost. It's like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or
[2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:26.640]  you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and
[2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:31.160]  confused. You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned
[2:32:31.160 --> 2:32:36.640]  us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab
[2:32:36.640 --> 2:32:40.360]  recently came out and gave a speech he called the great new narrative where he brags how
[2:32:40.360 --> 2:32:45.400]  the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people
[2:32:45.400 --> 2:32:49.760]  are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the
[2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:58.800]  great reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at infowars.com.
[2:32:58.800 --> 2:33:05.800]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:46.800]  We'll make an ally of you yet. We'll make an ally of you yet. We'll make an ally of you
[2:33:46.800 --> 2:34:01.800]  yet. The little stride will convert your children. Then we'll turn to you giving all the fear
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:10.800]  inside his spring like you never knew. This is what you call brainwashing folks. None
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:15.560]  of it's organic. It's all propaganda. It's all brainwashing. It's all astroturf. It's
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:23.680]  all a corrupt political agenda. But you know that song there that we just played that was
[2:34:23.680 --> 2:34:29.920]  from the San Francisco choir. I believe it was last year when you had conservatives warning
[2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:39.040]  about what Democrats were doing to children. Promoting them into sexualization. Promoting
[2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:48.120]  them into sexual deviancy and quite frankly just outright engaging in pedophile behavior.
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:55.360]  And so that's what this is now. And that little rendition from that choir there it hits a
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:01.320]  little bit differently after this weekend doesn't it. In fact guys I want to do this. Because
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:07.280]  there's a very important thing. There's a very important lesson that I want to teach
[2:35:07.280 --> 2:35:12.760]  here today that some people may not understand when you see this stuff. But guys yeah you
[2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:16.400]  guys are reading my mind. What I want to do is I want to play that again. I want to play
[2:35:16.400 --> 2:35:21.440]  the audio but let's have it playing with sights and scenes not the sound. So I want
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:25.360]  the audio from the San Francisco choir saying we'll convert your children. I mean that's
[2:35:25.360 --> 2:35:28.920]  a direct threat. I mean I don't know how else we're going to convert your children to a
[2:35:28.920 --> 2:35:33.280]  sexual deviancy. I mean that's I don't know how that's not a direct threat. And then but
[2:35:33.280 --> 2:35:39.280]  guys I want the pictures and the scenes and the videos from the event in Dallas on the
[2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:44.360]  screen as we play the video because as we play the audio because it just hits differently
[2:35:44.360 --> 2:35:47.760]  doesn't it. And I'm kind of springing on this on the crew last minute but it just came to
[2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:53.560]  me. Guys can we make that happen. Do we have all those elements ready to go. So guys so
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:59.200]  again that was the San Francisco choir making a joke out of conservatives warning about
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:04.240]  how the left is sexualizing children and quite frankly engaged in I mean if it's not pedophile
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:09.560]  activity it's as close as you can get to it. And so the video just hits differently after
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:10.560]  this weekend here it is.
[2:36:10.560 --> 2:36:30.680]  We'll convert your children. Go and say San Francisco. Go and turn up that disco. You'll
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:43.560]  forget you were ever upset. We'll convert your children and make an ally of you yet.
[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:49.600]  Yeah they want you to be an ally of evil. No we're not going to be an ally of evil.
[2:36:49.600 --> 2:37:03.520]  We're not going to be an ally of you yet. We'll convert your children. Then we'll turn
[2:37:03.520 --> 2:37:12.680]  to you giving off the parents idea. It's free like you never knew. Go and say San Francisco.
[2:37:12.680 --> 2:37:23.680]  Go and turn up that disco. You'll forget you were ever upset. We'll convert your children
[2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:39.680]  and make an ally of you yet. We'll make an ally of you yet. We'll make an ally of you
[2:37:39.680 --> 2:37:46.680]  yet.
[2:38:09.680 --> 2:38:14.840]  Most of these people are not actually pedophiles. Pedophiles will take advantage of this system
[2:38:14.840 --> 2:38:20.080]  obviously but most of the people engaging in this promoting this are not pedophiles themselves.
[2:38:20.080 --> 2:38:27.040]  They understand the power of propaganda and they understand the power in taking the innocence
[2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.960]  from the youth and brainwashing them at a young age so that they can be controlled.
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:34.680]  That's what this is all about and so let me tie it into something else that's happening
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:41.560]  right now. There's the new Top Gun movie Maverick and it's very popular. People are happy because
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:50.600]  it promotes America as a good, a force of good. It promotes the Navy and pilots as awesome
[2:38:50.600 --> 2:38:57.640]  badasses and it's just a very pro-America type thing. Top Gun inspires patriotic fervor
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:39:02.960]  as search trends to become fighter pilots soar and apparently Navy fighter pilot requests
[2:39:02.960 --> 2:39:09.680]  are up too. That's the power of propaganda. Now am I saying Top Gun Maverick is a propaganda
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:15.400]  film? Well anything can be propaganda. I'm saying it's influential. I'm saying it has
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:22.560]  an impact. Now the social engineers obviously know the power of this. Hollywood obviously
[2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:28.600]  knows the power of this, has for a long time. The Nazis understood this. Goebbels, Berniers,
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:36.640]  I mean it's very well known, the power of propaganda and so use Top Gun Maverick as
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:44.800]  an example but there's so many others. How many movies have inspired people and influenced
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:50.080]  their lives? It can be silly movies like Star Wars but then that ended up having a major
[2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:54.360]  impact on people. I'm sure there's movies that you remember watching as a kid that
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:40:00.400]  had big impact on your life and put something into your head that inspired you. So they
[2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:06.240]  understand that and they understand that it's the most impressionable at a young age. So
[2:40:06.240 --> 2:40:12.640]  that's why they're targeting the children with all of this. So yes, they are grooming
[2:40:12.640 --> 2:40:20.840]  them, absolutely grooming them. Now to what ends? I'm open for debate. Now are they literally
[2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:25.880]  just grooming them so that they can engage in sexual acts with them or is there something
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:29.120]  else going on here? Are they grooming them to somehow think that they're going to be
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:34.200]  voters for the Democrat Party if they turn gay the rest of their lives? Is it just all
[2:40:34.200 --> 2:40:41.440]  about more satanic activity and sexual deviation? I mean so but that's what's going on. They're
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:46.680]  going after the kids, it's all propaganda and it's all meant to hit them when they're
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:50.520]  innocent, hit them when they're impressionable so that they can control them the rest of
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:58.720]  their lives. And if you can be controlled via sex, that's huge and they know that. So that's
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:03.120]  why they're doing it to the kids. And I had somebody who's a liberal reach out to me,
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:06.680]  friend of mine who follows the show, I mean disagrees with me but knows he's going to
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:10.280]  get more accurate information from me than anywhere else and he says, you know, you shouldn't
[2:41:10.280 --> 2:41:16.840]  just sit here and call all these people pedophiles because it turns people like me off, I feel
[2:41:16.840 --> 2:41:23.960]  like you're exaggerating and you're overblowing it. So fine, I'll hear that. If you don't
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:28.280]  want to call that pedophilia what happened in Dallas this weekend, if you don't want
[2:41:28.280 --> 2:41:33.200]  to call that pedophilia then fine. I mean, but can we not come to a mutual agreement
[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:40.520]  that that is most certainly inappropriate? And if not borderlining on child abuse, if
[2:41:40.520 --> 2:41:47.400]  not borderlining on pedophilia, at least it's inappropriate. I mean, can we not all agree
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:54.680]  on that but they're not going to stop folks. Arlington, Texas is having a Disney drag
[2:41:54.680 --> 2:41:58.760]  bunch of brunch this upcoming Sunday. I have a feeling some people are going to show up
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:42:11.280]  to protest this too. June 12th, two shows drag brunch for kids featuring Mystique Summers
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:15.800]  and other drag queen story time people, but they don't even do the story time anymore.
[2:42:15.800 --> 2:42:20.000]  It's just drag queen strip tease. It's drag queen sexual time. It's drag queen dance time
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:26.920]  for kids. So that's this Sunday, June 12th, two shows Troy's Inside Texas Live Disney
[2:42:26.920 --> 2:42:31.800]  drag brunch. I'm sure that's going to be so good for kids. That's going to be so great
[2:42:31.800 --> 2:42:35.160]  and I'm sure lots of conservatives will show up to tell you how they really feel about
[2:42:35.160 --> 2:42:42.400]  it. Here's the solution. Texas lawmaker proposes ban on minors attending drag shows. This is
[2:42:42.400 --> 2:42:49.360]  the answer right here. Make them defend child drag shows. Make them defend this inappropriate
[2:42:49.360 --> 2:42:55.000]  activity borderlining on pedophilia. Make them defend it. Make the public see it. That's
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:03.520]  the answer. The biggest sale of the historic year 2022 is here. It's our Memorial Day special

[2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:10.680]  So what can I do? Well I can take supplements to make sure I'm getting the vitamin A, the

[2:49:52.960 --> 2:49:58.640]  it's not just about us here at Infowars but it's about our transmissions being a forum
[2:49:58.640 --> 2:50:05.280]  of communication and truth and then us building band.video so that other censored and banned
[2:50:05.280 --> 2:50:12.760]  individuals can have a platform that they otherwise would not. So that's what your support
[2:50:12.760 --> 2:50:17.840]  at infowarsstore.com does. All right, let's look at some of these other news stories before
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:23.800]  Wayne Allen Root takes over. Mexican president calls for American super state and open borders.
[2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:28.000]  Well we're essentially already there. There already is a wide open border. The problem
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:33.560]  is, you know, here's the thing, in a way, in a way, sadly we've reached a point where
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:40.080]  this would actually benefit the U.S. in some ways. It would hurt the U.S. in some ways,
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:44.000]  but right now it's just the open border is just hurting us. So really we just need to
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:50.960]  close the border and do no more illegal immigration. That's the obvious answer. But if we just
[2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:55.880]  opened the borders, that would provide us an avenue to get rid of the welfare state.
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:59.560]  If we just officially said no, no more borders, well then we would get rid of the welfare
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:03.920]  state and we wouldn't be spending hundreds of billions of dollars on non-citizens and
[2:51:03.920 --> 2:51:09.840]  illegal immigrants like we are currently. I'm not saying I support that, but I'm saying
[2:51:09.840 --> 2:51:15.080]  now the Mexican president is sitting here saying, look, we already have wide open borders,
[2:51:15.080 --> 2:51:20.080]  so why don't we actually have some sort of a diplomatic solution like they have in Europe
[2:51:20.080 --> 2:51:27.640]  so that we don't have this border crisis anymore? So I kind of understand where the
[2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:32.680]  Mexican president is coming from here. The wide open U.S. border is hurting Mexico too.
[2:51:32.680 --> 2:51:36.920]  So they want to get rid of this. They're looking to do anything they can to mitigate this wide
[2:51:36.920 --> 2:51:42.320]  open border policy that the Democrats are implementing. I don't agree with the solution. I'm just
[2:51:42.320 --> 2:51:48.920]  telling you that's what's going on. But think about that. The Democrats want a wide open
[2:51:48.920 --> 2:51:54.640]  border and an endless welfare state. We all know where that leads. We all know where that
[2:51:54.640 --> 2:51:58.360]  goes, except apparently liberals and Democrat voters, they're stupid, so they don't know
[2:51:58.360 --> 2:52:02.600]  where that goes. But we already have a wide open southern border. We've already had millions
[2:52:02.600 --> 2:52:08.360]  of illegal immigrants come into this country today so far to this calendar year. Here's
[2:52:08.360 --> 2:52:12.760]  the next one. Actually, there's two caravans on the way right now. There's one that you
[2:52:12.760 --> 2:52:21.120]  see right here in Tapa Chulo, Mexico of 7,000. And there's actually another one right now.
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:27.640]  I forget where it's going through of 12,000. So I mean, it's just totally out of control.
[2:52:27.640 --> 2:52:31.720]  Who funds this? Who pays for this? Well, you do. You're paying for all this. Once they
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:37.080]  get here, they get free welfare. They get free food. They get free shelter. They get
[2:52:37.080 --> 2:52:43.720]  free travel. They get free clothes. And you're paying for all of it, so it's not really free,
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:48.600]  is it? You're paying for it. It's free for them. That's why they're coming here. They're
[2:52:48.600 --> 2:52:52.440]  not coming here because they have prospects. They're not coming here because they want
[2:52:52.440 --> 2:52:56.800]  to build a business. They're not coming here because they're persecuted in their own country.
[2:52:56.800 --> 2:53:02.620]  Rather, excuse me. They're coming here because they want free stuff. And the Democrats are
[2:53:02.620 --> 2:53:07.760]  giving it to them with the plan of turning them into Democrat voters and then conquering
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:14.160]  the country via this invasion democratically. That's what this is. This is a Democrat voter
[2:53:14.160 --> 2:53:20.600]  block invasion that the Democrats are facilitating at the hopes they can turn 10 million, 20
[2:53:20.600 --> 2:53:26.000]  million, 30 million, 40 million, however many it is, illegal immigrants into permanent Democrat
[2:53:26.000 --> 2:53:33.440]  voters by making America a fourth world impoverished hellhole, and then promising these people
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:37.640]  free food and money like they've already gotten, which they won't deliver on. They've gotten
[2:53:37.640 --> 2:53:42.400]  it now. They won't get it in the future, hoping they can turn them into Democrat voters.
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:46.400]  It's sick. It's treasonous. It's illegal. It should be shut down, but we're sitting here
[2:53:46.400 --> 2:53:52.360]  dealing with this criminal activity every day. John Durham's prosecution may have lost
[2:53:52.360 --> 2:53:56.560]  the battle, but they're clearly winning the war, says former director of national intelligence
[2:53:56.560 --> 2:54:04.400]  John Radcliffe to Maria Bartiromo on Fox News this morning. I'm sorry, no, Mr. Radcliffe.
[2:54:04.400 --> 2:54:11.480]  I like you, but I don't see how you're correct there at all. I don't see how John Durham
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:18.520]  is winning any war. What war is John Durham winning? Clinton already got away with her
[2:54:18.520 --> 2:54:27.680]  crimes. Obama already got away with his crimes. There is no war. The war is over. Now it's
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:34.640]  just Democrat party tyranny. Trump supporters are suffering. Trump supporters are being
[2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:41.820]  persecuted, arrested, locked up, tortured, solitary confinement. Where is any victory
[2:54:41.820 --> 2:54:46.920]  for John Durham? Show me a single victory for John Durham that would make you say he's
[2:54:46.920 --> 2:54:51.280]  winning the war. No, we're losing the war for the country. John Durham, I'm sorry to
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:55:03.440]  say, is a loser, is a loser winning the war. I don't see any battles won. I don't see any
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:09.400]  wars won. I see Hillary Clinton walking free. I see Barack Obama walking free and I see
[2:55:09.400 --> 2:55:15.400]  innocent Americans being tortured in solitary confinement for a Democrat political stunt.
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:23.640]  So John Radcliffe thinks that's winning the war. John Radcliffe is not very bright. There's
[2:55:23.640 --> 2:55:30.120]  been an interesting turn here with the Kyle Rittenhouse story. And this is just a headline,
[2:55:30.120 --> 2:55:33.640]  but I want to go somewhere different with this, but it's, Kyle Rittenhouse was on Fox
[2:55:33.640 --> 2:55:37.920]  News with his lawyer last night. Kyle Rittenhouse announced his lawsuits against Facebook founder
[2:55:37.920 --> 2:55:44.480]  Mark Zuckerberg and other media outlets. But here's what's happening with Kyle Rittenhouse.
[2:55:44.480 --> 2:55:52.920]  Kyle Rittenhouse is now becoming a major second amendment activist, most likely unwittingly,
[2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:58.680]  because he's kind of become, in a way, like a social media phenom and he's been turned
[2:55:58.680 --> 2:56:03.440]  into a living meme and the Democrats tried to destroy an innocent young man's life and
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.800]  lost, turning him into a bit of a celebrity. And now he's on the Internet posting videos
[2:56:08.800 --> 2:56:13.240]  and photos with guns, firing ranges, making jokes about Biden and Democrats and all this
[2:56:13.240 --> 2:56:20.520]  stuff. And so what the Democrats have done here is they've turned Kyle Rittenhouse into
[2:56:20.520 --> 2:56:28.000]  a second amendment activist who is going to be in turn creating a bunch of other second
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:35.040]  amendment activists in his age group that would not have been there before. There would
[2:56:35.040 --> 2:56:41.800]  not have been a Kyle Rittenhouse. There would not have been a young individual that turned
[2:56:41.800 --> 2:56:55.560]  into kind of a second amendment activist promoter just through osmosis promoting to young men,
[2:56:55.560 --> 2:57:01.000]  safe, practical, legal use of firearms. They've now created that and Kyle Rittenhouse. And
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:05.940]  so thousands of young men that would have never heard about gun culture or the second
[2:57:05.940 --> 2:57:10.640]  amendment or anything like that, if not millions, are now going to be following Kyle Rittenhouse
[2:57:10.640 --> 2:57:17.080]  and getting involved in gun culture and learning how to use firearms legally and lawfully and
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:22.520]  safely. So thanks, Democrats. Thank you for that. You always, Democrats have always been
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:28.080]  the number one gun salesman in America. They always have been and they will always continue
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:33.480]  to be because people understand, oh, wow, I see tyrants. I see evil. I see Democrats.
[2:57:33.480 --> 2:57:38.720]  I better get a gun. It's a natural, it's a natural instinct, instinctive response when
[2:57:38.720 --> 2:57:41.920]  you see a tyrant you want to arm up. That's why people see Democrats and they immediately
[2:57:41.920 --> 2:57:49.320]  want to get guns. Rain Alan Root takes over. I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:53.920]  pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune
[2:57:53.920 --> 2:57:59.160]  and Money Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[2:57:59.160 --> 2:58:04.360]  30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers, and almost all of them
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:09.360]  just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part
[2:58:09.360 --> 2:58:13.160]  of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[2:58:13.160 --> 2:58:18.880]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:58:18.880 --> 2:58:24.160]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your
[2:58:24.160 --> 2:58:29.880]  money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[2:59:48.640 --> 2:59:58.920]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:59:58.920 --> 3:00:09.920]  All right, Wayne Alleroots, guest host every Tuesday afternoon here at InfoWars in the
[3:00:09.920 --> 3:00:16.720]  Alex Jones show. Guest hosting from 12 noon West Coast time to 1 o'clock, so 3 o'clock
[3:00:16.720 --> 3:00:22.760]  to 4 o'clock, East Coast time. Welcome back to the show. Great to be with you. All right,
[3:00:22.760 --> 3:00:28.200]  I wanted to talk to you about my latest commentary. I think it's very necessary for you to hear
[3:00:28.200 --> 3:00:33.400]  this. I wrote it on Friday morning and, you know, as a Jew, which I am, born Jewish, although
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:39.800]  I took Christ as my savior, Jesus Christ as my savior, 32 years almost today, almost to
[3:00:39.800 --> 3:00:44.680]  the day. So, I'm a completed Jew, a medic Jew, whatever term you'd like to use, but
[3:00:44.680 --> 3:00:52.240]  I'm still a Jew. Two Jewish parents, four Jewish grandparents sent away my DNA. I'm 99.9% Eastern
[3:00:52.240 --> 3:00:58.320]  European Jewish. So, I think I qualify as Jewish, don't you think? And as a Jew, I think
[3:00:58.320 --> 3:01:04.040]  I'm qualified without any criticism for the media to make a comparison between what's
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:10.040]  happening today and at least one aspect of Nazi Germany. I'm not comparing what's happening
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:17.680]  today to the Holocaust. I'm comparing what's happening today to the Nazi German army takeover
[3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:24.440]  of Europe, which happened in record time in split second time. It was the most incredible
[3:01:24.440 --> 3:01:30.160]  takeover. The speed was the most incredible takeover in the history of military. No one
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:36.000]  imagined you could take over a country in a day in two days. And Hitler's forces took
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:43.520]  over Poland and Belgium and Netherlands and France and you name the country in Czechoslovakia
[3:01:43.520 --> 3:01:50.360]  in such fast time. And most people don't know why or how they did it. And I'm a student
[3:01:50.360 --> 3:01:56.320]  of history and I know how and why they did it. So, I named my latest commentary, which
[3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:02.120]  appeared in newspapers around the country this weekend, the Biden Blitzkrieg. Biden is destroying
[3:02:02.120 --> 3:02:08.240]  the USA as fast as Nazis on meth. I like to put a little humor in my titles at the same
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:13.800]  time as a little shock of value. The Biden Blitzkrieg, Biden is destroying the USA as
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:18.680]  fast as Nazis on meth. I'm a Jewish American. I understand my history. The speed with which
[3:02:18.680 --> 3:02:24.260]  Biden and his Marxist handlers are destroying America and the US economy has never been
[3:02:24.260 --> 3:02:31.840]  seen in world history except for Nazi Germany. I call this the Biden Blitzkrieg because
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:37.440]  I compare what's happening today in America to the Nazi Blitzkrieg. The Nazi army conquered
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:43.080]  Europe at a speed never before seen in world history. Do you know how the Nazis did it?
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:48.600]  Hitler pumped his troops with meth. That's right, speed. The Nazi army was literally
[3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:55.200]  drugged with speed. They became super human speed freaks who could run, fight and kill
[3:02:55.200 --> 3:03:00.960]  24 hours a day, seven days a week for weeks on end, until their bodies collapsed and they
[3:03:00.960 --> 3:03:05.880]  died of a heart attack or they were killed in action. And this is how Hitler conquered
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:12.440]  each country in Europe in a matter of days. And no Democrats, I'm not comparing what's
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:16.680]  happening today to the Holocaust. Nothing ever compares to the Holocaust. Nothing ever
[3:03:16.680 --> 3:03:23.200]  compares to that atrocity. But I am comparing what's happening today under Biden and his
[3:03:23.200 --> 3:03:29.760]  handlers to the speed at which the Nazi army captured each country in Europe.
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:35.160]  So now let's now reflect on the speed and the depth of the destruction of America and
[3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:42.040]  the U.S. economy by this Biden Blitzkrieg. It takes your breath away. We're being attacked
[3:03:42.040 --> 3:03:49.680]  and destroyed from a thousand different directions at once. The speed of the attack is stunning.
[3:03:49.680 --> 3:03:55.960]  Biden has got to be employing an army of lawyers, bureaucrats, regulators and radical Marxist
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:04:02.600]  activists on meth just like the Nazis and the Nazi soldiers to carry out this vicious
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:09.640]  24-7 attack on the American people and on American business.
[3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:13.800]  So I'll finish this. We have about 30 seconds to go. I'll finish this story when we get
[3:04:13.800 --> 3:04:19.520]  back in the next segment. My commentary again is comparing not Nazi Germany or the Holocaust,
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:26.360]  but the Nazi army's Blitzkrieg taking over Europe to Biden's Blitzkrieg right now, taking
[3:04:26.360 --> 3:04:30.720]  over the United States and destroying the U.S. economy, destroying the middle class,
[3:04:30.720 --> 3:04:34.920]  destroying capitalism. It's all happening right in front of you. And when I get back,
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:39.440]  I'll tell you about the latest honor in my life because I am now, sir, Wayne Allyn Root,
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:43.920]  knighted this weekend. We'll be right back and I'll tell you more. Wayne Allyn Root,
[3:04:43.920 --> 3:04:57.080]  for America.com, Wade Root at gmail.com.
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:05:00.520]  It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the Internet
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:04.240]  and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to
[3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:07.480]  level the playing field. Everybody's going to have access to the same information and
[3:05:07.480 --> 3:05:12.000]  everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information. That's our goal, to get
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:17.320]  back to that place where we all have access to all of the information. We all have the
[3:05:17.320 --> 3:05:23.000]  ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want, and
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:27.680]  we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:34.040]  categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're
[3:05:34.040 --> 3:05:38.960]  having, because of the Internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the
[3:05:38.960 --> 3:05:43.880]  people we want to talk to about these things. That's our goal, is to help people take back
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:47.920]  their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy. That's really what we're trying
[3:05:47.920 --> 3:05:54.520]  to do. I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com. That's
[3:05:54.520 --> 3:06:09.760]  boltowireless.com.
[3:06:09.760 --> 3:06:12.640]  I want to tell you about something wonderful that happened to me this weekend because I
[3:06:12.640 --> 3:06:19.600]  think it's important in the context of this show because in my opinion, in my humble opinion,
[3:06:19.600 --> 3:06:25.040]  the Democrat Party's goal is to rip apart America, destroy capitalism, destroy them
[3:06:25.040 --> 3:06:30.720]  in a class, destroy the mobility and opportunity of America, destroy American exceptionalism,
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:36.880]  and destroy the American dream. I am the American dream. I'm a witness to the American dream
[3:06:36.880 --> 3:06:42.560]  because I'm living it. I'm an SOB, son of a butcher. I started out the son of a butcher.
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:46.600]  My dad walked around with a white apron with blood stains on it, went to a butcher store
[3:06:46.600 --> 3:06:51.720]  every day, six days a week. I was just knighted this weekend. There's the video up on the
[3:06:51.720 --> 3:06:56.680]  screen of the knighting of Wayne Allerud. It was the honor of a lifetime. It's the oldest
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:04.680]  royal house we believe in the world. It dates back to AD 312, AD 312. There I am with the
[3:07:04.680 --> 3:07:11.880]  Prince of Spain, Prince Rafael. The actual house that knighted me is the royal order
[3:07:11.880 --> 3:07:18.520]  or the royal house of Constantine the Great and St. Helen, and I am forever now known
[3:07:18.520 --> 3:07:23.360]  as Sir Wayne Allerud. It was a great honor. They knighted 24 people. They do this every
[3:07:23.360 --> 3:07:29.040]  year. They knight 24 people from around the world at events around the world, generally
[3:07:29.040 --> 3:07:36.040]  in Europe, usually in Spain or Finland, sometimes in Hawaii because the only royal palace in
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:43.600]  America on US soil is in Hawaii. And there it is. Some great music to go along with the
[3:07:43.600 --> 3:07:50.440]  knighting, some royal music. But this happened at the Venetian, Sir Wayne Allerud, at the
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:56.640]  Venetian in Las Vegas just this past weekend. It happened Sunday night, actually. And they
[3:07:56.640 --> 3:08:01.400]  had it in Vegas because of COVID. They thought people might have a hard time from around
[3:08:01.400 --> 3:08:06.280]  the world getting to Spain or Finland or even the royal palace in Hawaii. So they changed
[3:08:06.280 --> 3:08:12.880]  it this year to Las Vegas and they knighted 24 people, 12 new women and 12 men from every
[3:08:12.880 --> 3:08:18.600]  different field for their spectacular accomplishments in life. And it isn't just about money, by
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:23.160]  the way. It isn't about money. It's not about TV success. It's really about what you've
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:28.320]  achieved. There was one person there that had a US Marine with four tours of duty in
[3:08:28.320 --> 3:08:33.640]  Iraq who saw amazing action in Iraq. And he was knighted as well. I thought that was great.
[3:08:33.640 --> 3:08:39.320]  There was a SWAT cop who was knighted for his incredible work in law enforcement. And
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:44.920]  then there were some really famous people, Alex Stern, who invented constant contact.
[3:08:44.920 --> 3:08:49.440]  The thing that almost everyone in America uses to send out mass emails. Alex Stern was
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:55.920]  knighted. He's a billionaire. The Rolando Blackman, the four-time NBA All-Star and collegiate
[3:08:55.920 --> 3:09:02.680]  champion and Olympian and congressional gold medal winner was knighted. And Ray Parker
[3:09:02.680 --> 3:09:06.640]  Jr. was knighted alongside me. If you don't know, Ray Parker Jr. is one of the great
[3:09:06.640 --> 3:09:11.200]  songwriters in the history of the American music business, including the one he'll probably
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:17.120]  forever be known for. Who are you going to call? Ghostbusters. That's Ray Parker Jr.,
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:23.560]  also an incredible guitarist who backed up Stevie Wonder and the Rolling Stones on guitar.
[3:09:23.560 --> 3:09:30.160]  So we were all honored and Wayne Root was honored for both my business career and entrepreneurship
[3:09:30.160 --> 3:09:34.840]  and for the arts, my entertainment, TV and radio career. So I'm forever known as Sir
[3:09:34.840 --> 3:09:39.640]  Wayne Alleroot. It's a great honor and I greatly appreciate it. But what it proves is the American
[3:09:39.640 --> 3:09:45.960]  dream is alive. First of all, I am the conservative warrior. Nobody fights like me. The only guys
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:50.760]  who are even close. Alex Jones fights like me. He was really close. And I think Tucker
[3:09:50.760 --> 3:09:56.200]  Carlson on Fox fights like me. He's really close. And there's a few guys on podcasts
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:02.360]  that I really like. But in general, in general, there aren't a lot of fighters in this world.
[3:10:02.360 --> 3:10:07.000]  The Republican party is a bunch of cowards, bunch of feckless, weak cowards who are afraid
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:12.120]  of their own shadow or they've been bought off and bribed or both. But I'm a fighter
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:16.720]  and I'm a warrior. Isn't it apt? Isn't it perfect that this warrior should now be a
[3:10:16.720 --> 3:10:21.720]  knight and that I was given my ceremonial sword, which must weigh about 15 pounds?
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:25.560]  Matter of fact, if I get a chance during the break, if we have a two minute break instead
[3:10:25.560 --> 3:10:29.600]  of one minute, I'll run downstairs and grab my sword and I'll show it to you. It's huge
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:33.640]  and it's heavy. And I had to walk through the entire Venetian after the ceremony with
[3:10:33.640 --> 3:10:38.560]  the sword. And I turned to my wife and I said, can you imagine the reactions we're going
[3:10:38.560 --> 3:10:46.200]  to get when I'm walking through the Venetian casino in a white tailed tux and a sword?
[3:10:46.200 --> 3:10:49.680]  And she said to me, oh my God, this is going to be weird. And then I walked through the
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:56.400]  casino four levels to get outside to my car in front and valet, four levels with a tux
[3:10:56.400 --> 3:11:02.080]  and a white tails and a sword or actually black tails with a white vest and a sword.
[3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:07.480]  And not one person said anything. That kind of tells you everything you need to know about
[3:11:07.480 --> 3:11:12.600]  Las Vegas. Nobody even thought it was odd that a guy was in a tuxedo with a sword walking
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:17.720]  through a casino. The guards were aware. I was walked out by two guards who said, why
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:22.520]  do you have a sword? And I said, I was just knighted and they were like, how cool is that?
[3:11:22.520 --> 3:11:25.800]  Can we walk with you and hear the story? And that way we'll actually guard you and make
[3:11:25.800 --> 3:11:29.960]  sure nothing strange happens when it attacks you and grabs your sword. So I was walked
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:34.880]  out of the casino by two guards, but not one person had a weird reaction to me carrying
[3:11:34.880 --> 3:11:38.440]  a sword through a casino. It tells you all you need to know about Las Vegas.
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:42.960]  All right, let's get back to it. So I just want to point out again, son of a butcher
[3:11:42.960 --> 3:11:48.840]  from the wrong side of the tracks, Malvern in New York, Bronx borderline, mostly majority
[3:11:48.840 --> 3:11:53.520]  minority town, mostly black town, all black middle school, all black high school. And
[3:11:53.520 --> 3:11:59.400]  today I have a star, 180 pound granted star in the Las Vegas sidewalk on the Las Vegas
[3:11:59.400 --> 3:12:05.440]  walk of stars with Frank Sinatra, Elvis, Wayne Newton and Liberace. And today I'm knighted
[3:12:05.440 --> 3:12:10.800]  Sir Wayne Alleroot and this October, I'll be in the Hall of Fame, the Nevada Broadcasting
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:16.520]  Hall of Fame. And I would say that America has been pretty good to me. Only in America
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:21.200]  could this happen has nothing to do with me and my talent. It's that if I had the same
[3:12:21.200 --> 3:12:25.920]  person, same talent, any other country in the world, it couldn't happen. And any socialist
[3:12:25.920 --> 3:12:31.240]  or communist country, it's the opposite. Not only couldn't happen, I'd be in a prison cell
[3:12:31.240 --> 3:12:37.440]  or I'd be living an abject poverty. God bless America. Only in America. All right, let me
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:42.360]  finish my column about the Nazi Blitzkrieg, the Biden Blitzkrieg compared to the Nazi
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:47.800]  Blitzkrieg, Biden is destroying the USA as fast as Nazis on meth. Let's not reflect on
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:52.400]  the speed and the depth of the destruction of America and the US economy in this Biden
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:57.800]  Blitzkrieg. Bookmakers across the world have made Donald J. Trump the huge favor to win
[3:12:57.800 --> 3:13:04.200]  the presidency in 2024. All that's well and good, but I have bad news for America. We
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:10.840]  are going to make it to 2024. America is hanging by a thread. Listen to me. We're not going
[3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:18.840]  to make it to 2024. I'm not even sure we're going to make it to the November midterms.
[3:13:18.840 --> 3:13:24.080]  Republicans are in a dream state. Do you think they're going to let us win in a landslide?
[3:13:24.080 --> 3:13:27.880]  You don't think there is clear martial law? You don't think there's going to be World War
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:32.120]  III breaking out to the United States, China and Russia? Or you don't think it's going
[3:13:32.120 --> 3:13:39.280]  to be about monkeypox or a new variant of COVID to make sure it's 100% mail-in voting
[3:13:39.280 --> 3:13:45.400]  and no one can leave their home? Or that combined with World War III? How about the Department
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:50.120]  of Homeland Security today announcing that all hell is about to break loose and they
[3:13:50.120 --> 3:13:55.200]  think there will be many violent acts coming up soon? What is that about? They're trying
[3:13:55.200 --> 3:14:01.000]  to set you up for no election in November. Ask the smartest billionaires in America,
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:05.720]  Jamie Dimon, and again, I'm running out of time. I'll finish it in the next segment,
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:09.800]  but let me give you a good part right here, a little bit of red meat. The smartest billionaires
[3:14:09.800 --> 3:14:15.200]  in America have spoken. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J.P. Morgan just warned that an economic
[3:14:15.200 --> 3:14:22.920]  hurricane is about to hit America. Then John Waldron, the president of Goldman Sachs,
[3:14:22.920 --> 3:14:28.720]  added that he has never seen so many major shocks to the system facing our economy at
[3:14:28.720 --> 3:14:35.420]  one time. The richest man on the planet, Elon Musk, said this week he has a super bad feeling
[3:14:35.420 --> 3:14:41.480]  about the economy and asked his top executives to stop all hiring worldwide. What are these
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:47.240]  non-stop shocks to the system? All these brilliant billionaires in Wall Street Titans are talking
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:53.680]  about. Well, let me see if I can run through a few of them. GDP, economic growth collapsing,
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:59.760]  stock market crashing, inflation exploding, home sales cratering, gas prices headed for
[3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:04.760]  $10 a gallon, which I've been predicting on this show and my national radio show for
[3:15:04.760 --> 3:15:09.920]  literally months now that gas will go to $10 a gallon and destroy the American economy
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:15.200]  and destroy the trucking industry so truckers cannot make a living anymore and they will
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:21.000]  stop, quit their job, stop bringing food to market and we will have a massive food shortage.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:25.560]  All right, I'll finish up. We'll get back. It's the Biden Blitzkrieg versus the Nazi
[3:15:25.560 --> 3:15:31.160]  Blitzkrieg, the speed at which they're destroying the U.S. economy. My name is Wayne Allyn Root.
[3:15:31.160 --> 3:15:38.320]  My website's Root4America.com. Root4America.com. You can always get me any time with email.
[3:15:38.320 --> 3:15:42.920]  Wayne Root at gmail.com, my book up on the screen, The Great Patriot Protest, The Boycott
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:47.280]  Book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book and the newest one coming out in the
[3:15:47.280 --> 3:15:52.760]  next 60 days, The Great Patriot Buy Cod Book with all the companies to buy from while you're
[3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:56.880]  boycotting all the woke liberal companies. We'll be right back.
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:00.400]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[3:16:00.400 --> 3:16:01.400]  Hello, Alex.
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:02.400]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:05.880]  All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other patriots can get on the
[3:16:05.880 --> 3:16:10.920]  line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Schreuer, Super
[3:16:10.920 --> 3:16:16.480]  Mel Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable tank.
[3:16:16.480 --> 3:16:21.560]  Super Mel Vitality really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:27.120]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered
[3:16:27.120 --> 3:16:31.280]  versions that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine
[3:16:31.280 --> 3:16:36.360]  wine. In fact, each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay.
[3:16:36.360 --> 3:16:39.840]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:44.760]  That's just how it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:49.680]  like super strong. But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is
[3:16:49.680 --> 3:16:52.680]  it.
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:17:02.480]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right. People ask,
[3:17:02.480 --> 3:17:06.720]  what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew
[3:17:06.720 --> 3:17:12.640]  this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've talked about is going to become
[3:17:12.640 --> 3:17:18.600]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports
[3:17:18.600 --> 3:17:25.400]  and documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth,
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:30.920]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're
[3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:35.120]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:38.720]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[3:17:38.720 --> 3:17:43.080]  for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you,
[3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:46.680]  info wars would not be here. I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are
[3:17:46.680 --> 3:17:51.480]  the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank
[3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:56.480]  you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.

[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:08.400]  magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[3:19:08.400 --> 3:19:13.680]  30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:18.640]  just screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:22.960]  of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:27.360]  it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:33.600]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.
[3:19:33.600 --> 3:19:37.920]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:19:39.040 --> 3:19:44.720]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com. One word,
[3:19:44.720 --> 3:20:03.360]  jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285. 833-904-285. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.360 --> 3:20:15.840]  All right, Sir Wayne Allen Root is back. Yes, I was knighted over the weekend. It is Sir Wayne
[3:20:15.840 --> 3:20:20.480]  Allen Root. Here is my sword, my trusty sword. I wanted to actually show it to you. Let me step
[3:20:20.480 --> 3:20:26.240]  back a little bit. It is the real thing is the kind of sword that someone would pull out and use
[3:20:26.240 --> 3:20:33.920]  in medieval times. It is engraved with my name, Sir Wayne Allen Root, and the royal order of
[3:20:33.920 --> 3:20:41.680]  Constantine the Great and St. Helen, and the date of my knighthood, my divesture, they say, knighthood,
[3:20:41.680 --> 3:20:48.640]  June 5th, 2022. A great honor, and I accept that honor. Sir Wayne Allen Root. All right,
[3:20:48.640 --> 3:20:54.800]  Qatar, there it is. My Yugoslavian friend is with me for 35 years now, producing every single TV
[3:20:54.800 --> 3:21:01.200]  show I've ever done for 35 years. One man came over from Serbia and met me within a year or two,
[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:06.320]  and the two of us kind of grew up together on CNBC, then known as Financial News Network,
[3:21:06.320 --> 3:21:12.000]  and we went to 32. Actually, in those days, there were only 28 NFL teams, 28 NFL training camps
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:17.680]  together, two seasons in a row. July and August, we traveled to 28 NFL training camps together,
[3:21:17.680 --> 3:21:21.760]  where I interviewed all the biggest names in sports, Joe Montana, Brian the Boss,
[3:21:21.760 --> 3:21:28.000]  Bosworth, you name it, all the biggest names in those days in sports for FNN sports, which then
[3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:35.760]  became CNBC. That was a lifetime ago. Let me continue with my commentary that was out through
[3:21:35.760 --> 3:21:42.160]  Crater Syndicate this weekend. The Biden Blitzkrieg, Biden's destroying the USA as fast as Nazis on
[3:21:42.160 --> 3:21:49.360]  meth, and let me repeat one paragraph so that no Democrat, no liberal, no communist scumbag could
[3:21:49.360 --> 3:21:56.080]  get me in trouble. No Democrats, i.e., communists. I'm not comparing what's happening today to the
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:02.800]  Holocaust. I'm a Jew. I understand the Holocaust. Nothing ever compares to that atrocity, or at
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:08.880]  least nothing so far has ever compared to that atrocity. But I am comparing what's happening today
[3:22:09.440 --> 3:22:16.800]  to Joe Biden and his handlers, and the speed at which they're destroying the United States,
[3:22:16.800 --> 3:22:22.960]  compared to the speed at which the Nazis captured each country in Europe. So what are these non-stop
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:29.600]  shocks to the system that some of the titans of Wall Street are saying are the worst things happening
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:35.520]  at one time from 20 different directions that they've ever seen in their lives? So GDP is
[3:22:35.520 --> 3:22:41.040]  collapsing, economic growth, interest rates rising, inflation exploding, home sales cratering,
[3:22:41.040 --> 3:22:48.960]  stock market just suffered the worst few months since 1929, and by some comparisons, worse than
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:54.480]  1929, with the amount of days and weeks the market was down. No one's ever seen anything like this.
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:02.080]  Gas headed for $10 a gallon. Grocery prices exploding to unimaginable levels. The trucking
[3:23:02.080 --> 3:23:07.600]  industry in disarray, and they bring every product to market, including all the food we need. The
[3:23:07.600 --> 3:23:14.560]  supply chain ruined. Massive food shortages coming. Baby formula shortages. You know how bad the baby
[3:23:14.560 --> 3:23:22.400]  formula shortages are? In Michigan, Biden administration airlifted baby formula to Michigan,
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:28.080]  and the news media told people it was there, and they wound up with a one mile line of cars
[3:23:28.640 --> 3:23:33.200]  to get baby formula to save their baby's lives. Does this remind you of anything?
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:39.920]  It reminds me of the fall of Saigon. Is this America? We have to airlift food to save baby's
[3:23:39.920 --> 3:23:45.440]  lives? Are we African now? Are we Haiti now? And you know where all the baby formula is?
[3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:52.800]  It's all at the border. Biden stuck it at the border to cause a baby food shortage,
[3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:57.520]  because he wants to make sure that millions of people are coming over the border soon. You
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:02.880]  knew that. He's asked for it. He's encouraged them. He's waving them in. And so he wanted to
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:07.600]  make sure there's plenty of baby formula for all the illegal alien babies that are about to enter
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:14.000]  United States soil and stay here forever. But it caused a massive shortage of baby formula for
[3:24:14.000 --> 3:24:20.080]  America's babies, plus the supply chain is screwed because of Joe Biden, plus no one wants to work
[3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:25.120]  anymore, plus Biden's FDA, the same one that brought us the killer vaccine that's killing
[3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:29.840]  so many people, and they said it was fine. And they told us it doesn't hurt pregnant women,
[3:24:29.840 --> 3:24:37.840]  even though they covered up the fact that in Pfizer's own pre-trial studies of all the pregnant
[3:24:37.840 --> 3:24:47.280]  women they gave it to, 82% lost their babies. They had miscarriages, 82% of the time. And then they
[3:24:47.280 --> 3:24:52.720]  went and told, every doctor in America went and told all the pregnant women, get the shot. It's
[3:24:52.720 --> 3:24:57.440]  completely safe. I guarantee everything's fine, because Pfizer didn't want that information
[3:24:57.440 --> 3:25:03.520]  released for 75 years. But it's in the Pfizer report that I've seen that everyone is seeing
[3:25:04.560 --> 3:25:10.240]  that was forced, ordered to come out by a judge who said, you can't wait 75 years. You've got to
[3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:16.640]  let all the pre-trial study come out now. And so thousands of pages came out and volunteers have
[3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:21.360]  looked through thousands of pages and they have found all these horrible things about the deaths
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:26.800]  and the injuries that happened in the pre-trials. And then they said, it's safe. Don't worry about
[3:25:26.800 --> 3:25:33.520]  it. They erased it. 82% of the women miscarried their babies. No problem. Drive on by. Nothing
[3:25:33.520 --> 3:25:38.400]  to see here. By the way, in the last New York Marathon a few days ago, the marathon two weeks
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:45.200]  ago, the New York Marathon, 16 runners collapsed with cardiac problems. Never seen anything like
[3:25:45.200 --> 3:25:52.480]  that in history. No problem. Drive on by. Run on by. Nothing wrong. So baby shortages, we're like
[3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:59.040]  the full of Saigon or we're like Biafra or we're like Haiti, countries that are crumbling and the
[3:25:59.040 --> 3:26:03.760]  babies are starving. And it's only going to get worse this summer as energy experts are promising
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:09.120]  mass blackouts of the electric grid across America this summer. And then there's the massive crime
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:16.880]  and theft wave enveloping America's Democrat run, blue big cities. Under Joe Biden's Marxist handlers,
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:25.200]  America has become a third world. I'll say crap hole. Third world crop hole. Don't forget open
[3:26:25.200 --> 3:26:31.120]  borders. Biden is desperate to open the floodgates and allow the whole world in. If Biden gets his
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:38.080]  way in title 42 is lifted, millions of the world's poorest and sickest migrants and violent criminals
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:43.840]  released from jails all over the world in hell holes all over the world will pour through our open
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:50.320]  borders. And let's not forget Democrats want to take all of our guns away. I've seen a movie
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:54.880]  where only the government and the military and the police have guns. You know what that movie's
[3:26:54.880 --> 3:27:02.320]  called? Schindler's List. That's what happens when the people have no guns. When the Jews have no
[3:27:02.320 --> 3:27:08.960]  guns, they gas them and tortured them and murdered them and took all their assets away from them
[3:27:08.960 --> 3:27:16.400]  and murdered their children. First experimental vaccines also remind me of what happened
[3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:23.040]  during Nazi Germany. And just in time for the midterm elections, I predict we will see new attempts
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:29.360]  to bring back lockdowns, vaccine mandates and vaccine passports with an experimental
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:35.360]  for emergency use solely vaccine that's killing people and they want to force it on your children,
[3:27:35.360 --> 3:27:43.520]  let alone you. And now add in censorship, banning, intimidation and persecution of conservatives,
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:49.600]  patriots and even parents at PTA meetings by government agencies like the DOJ and the FBI.
[3:27:49.600 --> 3:27:56.160]  Exhibit A is the rest of high ranking Trump official Peter Navarro just days ago. And then
[3:27:56.160 --> 3:28:01.520]  there's the education system trying to brainwash and indoctrinate children with communist,
[3:28:01.520 --> 3:28:08.960]  anti-American, anti-white, transgender, sex identity, ideology. And don't forget Biden's poking
[3:28:08.960 --> 3:28:14.960]  Putin again and again, provoking him to start World War III. Does Biden want to provoke a nuclear
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:21.840]  armageddon or an EMP attack that will turn America into Mad Max? Clearly that's what he's doing.
[3:28:21.840 --> 3:28:28.400]  Is this all about destroying America so China can rule the world? This is the total decline,

[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:58.160]  so as we came on the air I saw a new interesting thing that comes across my desk and it is Bon Jovi
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:08.400]  the founding bassist of Bon Jovi is Alec John Such and he was found dead at 70 years old I think
[3:34:08.400 --> 3:34:14.480]  either this just happened or it happened over the weekend the founding member and founding bassist
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:22.080]  of John of of John Bon Jovi's group Bon Jovi is found dead so I just ask you it was only two weeks
[3:34:22.080 --> 3:34:28.160]  ago on this show that I think I came on and that morning they had announced that the famous actor
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:37.440]  was dead and then two more famous musicians died that week Ray Leota is the actor and then that week
[3:34:37.440 --> 3:34:45.200]  it was the uh a keyboardist of yes and then it was also another famous drummer from another group
[3:34:45.200 --> 3:34:51.840]  was found dead and they're all dead the same way they're dead suddenly unexpectedly those
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:57.920]  are the quotes unexpectedly dead found dead suddenly dead there are some people are now dead
[3:34:58.560 --> 3:35:02.960]  now listen I know they're rockers I know they're druggies I know they're drinkers
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:08.160]  you can get cancer that's a normal thing in America people have heart attacks and strokes
[3:35:08.160 --> 3:35:13.040]  before the advent of the vaccine so I'm giving you all the outs I'm giving you all the uh
[3:35:13.040 --> 3:35:18.400]  you know the little asterix is now Ray Leota up on the screen my one of my five favorite actors
[3:35:18.400 --> 3:35:25.760]  in the world he's dead now it don't you think this is funny strange bizarre that this many
[3:35:25.760 --> 3:35:33.040]  many famous people are dropping at the same time and by the way athlete deaths are up
[3:35:33.040 --> 3:35:41.440]  by 1700 percent since the advent of the vaccine now that nobody has done a study on celebrity
[3:35:41.440 --> 3:35:47.760]  deaths because how do you grade who's a celebrity you know and the celebrity include musicians and
[3:35:47.760 --> 3:35:53.600]  actors and politicians they're all dropping you know they're all dropping that the senator from
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:36:01.040]  from uh maryland democrat chris van holland I think his name is he had a stroke and and
[3:36:01.040 --> 3:36:06.640]  watermelon the guy running for us said it in uh excuse me for governor I think it is in in
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:12.000]  pennsylvania no us said in pennsylvania watermelon he had a stroke and now he's a pacemaker and he's
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:18.080]  a young guy you know young guy in his fifties you don't find this unusual athletes dropping dead
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:23.840]  dead non-stop musicians dropping dead actors dropping dead celebrities dropping dead entertainers
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:28.800]  dropping dead you know why because they're all liberal there's federman from pennsylvania
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:35.120]  because they're all liberal and so they all drank the kool-aid and they all took the vaccine
[3:36:35.120 --> 3:36:40.720]  and that's why they're dropping dead okay not every one of them like I said I gave you the asterix
[3:36:40.720 --> 3:36:47.760]  at the beginning of this little opinion piece by me now the bon jovi basis their basis they're all
[3:36:47.760 --> 3:36:53.360]  dropping dead some of them maybe we're gonna die anyway of cancer heart disease or stroke
[3:36:53.360 --> 3:36:58.080]  whether without the vaccine some of them kill their bodies with a lifetime of drugs and alcohol
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:05.760]  I get that but not all of them too many are dying in the headlines every day it's weird it's strange
[3:37:05.760 --> 3:37:13.520]  it's bizarre and at the same time that's happening okay I believe it's 86 percent is the number
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:20.880]  for the millennial generation deaths are up since the vaccine 86 percent death rate increase
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:27.760]  for young people millennials since the vaccine ask thomas renz the famous class action lawyer
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:33.360]  who's on my radio show all the time and thomas renz will tell you that in the military he's got
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:40.640]  the data from whistleblowers from the department of defense and he says cancer deaths are up 300
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:45.920]  percent in the military every other kind of death and injury is up dramatically uh but wait I said
[3:37:45.920 --> 3:37:52.720]  that wrong what i mean from what was accurate cancer is up 300 not cancer death getting cancer
[3:37:52.720 --> 3:38:01.840]  is up 300 the five-year moving average before the vaccine of of military members who got cancer
[3:38:01.840 --> 3:38:11.920]  was about 30 000 per year and today since the vaccine it's now 135 000 who have cancer the
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:17.520]  number is staggering how many of them will die how many are suffering right now pretty much all of
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:23.920]  them I know because I lost my mom and dad 28 dates apart from cancer in 1992 so number one I understand
[3:38:23.920 --> 3:38:28.640]  cancer number two I understand it can happen to anybody whether we're out of vaccine we had cancer
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:34.960]  long before the vaccine but cancer is exploding now there are many doctors uh the kind that I believe
[3:38:34.960 --> 3:38:41.680]  in who were not bought off by big pharma who are now saying admitting and warning that cancer in
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:49.280]  america is up between 1000 and 2000 percent since the vaccine this vaccine hits your immune system
[3:38:49.280 --> 3:38:55.760]  and destroys your immune system and causes basically AIDS okay it's not like you're gay
[3:38:55.760 --> 3:39:02.560]  it's not like you have AIDS you don't have HIV but you've got a form of AIDS called AIDS vaccine
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:10.000]  acquired immune deficiency and your your entire immune system is being destroyed uh by the vaccine
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:15.200]  these doctors tell me and all over the world they're seeing it people get I mean everyone I know
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:20.400]  as COVID right now is is triple vaccinated or quadruple vaccinated and they all go and it's
[3:39:20.400 --> 3:39:24.480]  amazing how ignorant they all are they all look at me and they go I don't get it I did everything
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:30.960]  right I got four vaccines why do I have COVID because you got four vaccines your numb nuts
[3:39:31.680 --> 3:39:38.480]  it's just amazing they've all been brainwashed by the media which lies and deceives and commits fraud
[3:39:38.480 --> 3:39:43.600]  and covers up for big pharma and they've all been deceived by the doctors let me go to my opinion
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:50.800]  ran about the doctors almost everybody listens to my show my national radio show that has been
[3:39:50.800 --> 3:39:55.360]  vaccinated and thank god it's probably only 20 percent 80 percent listen to me they did not get
[3:39:55.360 --> 3:40:01.200]  vaccinated but 20 got vaccinated maybe more maybe even 30 percent are vaccinated and when they
[3:40:01.200 --> 3:40:05.520]  emailed me and say how much they love my show and they wish they hadn't gotten vaccinated I say
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:11.840]  but if you listen to my show every day and you love my show so much why did you get vaccinated
[3:40:11.840 --> 3:40:16.560]  and you know what their answer is my doctor told me I had to do it my doctor said it's safe and
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:22.960]  you've got to do it or my boss at my job said you're fired and you lose your job and lose your
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:29.680]  income if you don't do it so between the threat of losing their entire income and the threat and
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:36.800]  intimidation from doctors saying are you stupid I'm your doctor I'm better than Wayne Allen Root
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:45.280]  a conservative radio host and why do they know better because doctors are very good at taking
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:49.840]  tests and they're brilliant people and they all graduated Harvard at the top of their class and
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:55.280]  went to Harvard medical school and all that jazz but the but I went to Columbia which by the way
[3:40:55.280 --> 3:41:00.640]  the latest rankings from US news world report the number one college in the world I believe was
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:06.640]  MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology number two was tied Harvard and Columbia so I've got the
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:11.280]  best college in America right up there and I met all these kids up close in person all my friends
[3:41:11.280 --> 3:41:15.600]  were medical students and law students and engineering students and they're all brilliant
[3:41:15.600 --> 3:41:21.680]  test takers but none of them had an ounce of common sense not one of them and they all are
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:28.160]  stooges and sheep who listen to authority okay the type of personality becomes a doctor
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:35.120]  listens to authority whatever the CDC says they do whatever the AMA says the American Medical
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:42.240]  Association they do whatever the FDA says they do and all three of those organizations were
[3:41:42.240 --> 3:41:47.920]  in cahoots with big pharma and they have poisoned the American people it's an opinion show it's my
[3:41:47.920 --> 3:41:53.760]  opinion they have poisoned the American people in the world with COVID vaccines that are killing
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:42:01.040]  people with heart attacks blood clots strokes massive increase in cancer and a thousand other
[3:42:01.040 --> 3:42:06.800]  problems including right at the top of the list immune dysfunction and immune disorder that is
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:13.520]  similar to AIDS and also right at the top of the list massive explosion in shingles and herpes and
[3:42:13.520 --> 3:42:19.360]  if you've ever had shingles or herpes on your face or on your body you know that's a life
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:24.880]  fruner life fruner and there's injecting people with something that destroys your immune system
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:30.080]  so shingles and herpes breakouts come out and they come out all the time and your life is
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:35.360]  ruined you might as well give up on life if you have non-stop shingles because the pain is so bad
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:40.400]  it's intense and it's burning and you can't get any work done and if it's on your face your career
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:47.600]  is over so that's the vaccine we'll talk more about when we get back way in root at gmail.com
[3:42:47.600 --> 3:42:53.680]  rootforamerica.com don't even look at that on the screen that is ugly we don't want any of that
[3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:59.520]  stay safe stay healthy we'll be right back the internet and talk radio are on fire
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:04.160]  with the slogan alec shones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's
[3:43:04.160 --> 3:43:10.400]  actually very sick feeling because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything
[3:43:10.400 --> 3:43:16.000]  i've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:22.720]  it anymore in policy reports and documents it's now out on the open claus Schwab said last week
[3:43:22.720 --> 3:43:29.920]  that they rule the earth the bilderberg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the
[3:43:29.920 --> 3:43:34.560]  open they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this
[3:43:34.560 --> 3:43:38.720]  thing god's watching the children counting on us i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:43.280]  your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars
[3:43:43.280 --> 3:43:48.400]  would not be here so i want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[3:43:48.400 --> 3:43:53.040]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance so i want to thank you and salute you again for all
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:58.400]  you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts anything of real quality anything of
[3:43:58.400 --> 3:44:04.640]  lasting durability anything that's really satisfying empowering and fulfilling it's going to be hard to
[3:44:04.640 --> 3:44:12.480]  attain and when it comes to information boy is that true today we see the entire global corrupt
[3:44:12.480 --> 3:44:18.880]  into a human depopulation great reset combine trying to collapse our society to build on
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:25.760]  its ashes their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people
[3:44:25.760 --> 3:44:31.920]  all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[3:44:31.920 --> 3:44:38.080]  their covetous area their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:44.080]  and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:49.920]  silenced and gaslit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[3:44:49.920 --> 3:44:54.320]  and that's why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links that's why we've
[3:44:54.320 --> 3:45:00.800]  got to share them now more than ever the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alec
[3:45:00.800 --> 3:45:05.440]  shows was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:11.920]  because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going
[3:45:11.920 --> 3:45:18.480]  to become more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports
[3:45:18.480 --> 3:45:24.480]  and documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:31.120]  the bill der berg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:35.520]  their move because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:39.840]  the children counting on us i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[3:45:39.840 --> 3:45:44.080]  and your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here
[3:45:44.080 --> 3:45:49.040]  so i want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason
[3:45:49.040 --> 3:45:53.840]  humanity has a fighting chance so i want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and
[3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:59.440]  ask you now to redouble your efforts everybody that's watching this needs to support alex jones
[3:45:59.440 --> 3:46:04.880]  needs to support info wars and band dot video you know the bible says let another mouth praise you
[3:46:04.880 --> 3:46:11.120]  i'm gonna do that right now alex jones has helped so many people in this industry you guys have no
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:16.480]  idea how many people have got their first start like savannah hernandez how many people have just
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:22.240]  been put on a launch pad the outer space because of alex jones including myself i've been given so
[3:46:22.240 --> 3:46:27.600]  many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and i would probably not even be
[3:46:27.600 --> 3:46:31.600]  half of where i am right now if it weren't for alex jones i mean i've been able to be on
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:37.840]  podcast with alex and joe rogan and tim castor super tim cast irl listen what i'm saying is
[3:46:37.840 --> 3:46:42.880]  do not take alex jones and band dot video for granted because you don't know what you have
[3:46:42.880 --> 3:46:48.320]  until it's gone we need to support free speech systems right now so go check out the store go
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:46:53.680]  support their store go support info wars leave a donation right now don't wait until they're gone
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:47:02.880]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:13.840]  all right way down the route is back sir way down the route i have to get used to saying
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:18.320]  that sir way down the route is back and it's funny because the only criticism i got about being
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:24.160]  knighted over the weekend 99 percent of everyone said oh my god how cool is that and congratulations
[3:47:24.160 --> 3:47:31.680]  wane but one percent said wane don't you hate globalists and isn't this like a globalist thing
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:37.120]  that you're knighted your sir way down the route i said no this is a group that first of all it's
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:42.400]  a humanitarian group and a charitable group that whose main goal in life is to give away
[3:47:42.400 --> 3:47:47.920]  a tremendous amount of money to women and children of the world who have been abused and are living
[3:47:47.920 --> 3:47:51.840]  in poverty so first of all it's a good thing second of all it's not globalist in any way
[3:47:52.480 --> 3:47:57.360]  almost everyone involved with the organization is a huge fan of mine and a huge fan of president
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:48:02.960]  trump so it was not a globalist thing in any way shape or form they like president trump
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:07.840]  matter of fact i gave a speech to the 24 people who are all being knighted and i was scared to
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:11.920]  death they don't hate my guts after i gave the speech and i told them i'm a friend of trump and
[3:48:11.920 --> 3:48:16.720]  i had my honeymoon at marlago with trump and i was a big supporter of trump and i've written books
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:21.120]  about trump and i have them on my radio show all the time in fact donald trump will be a guest
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:26.320]  on my national radio show coming up this monday this coming monday and that uh you know i've also
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:30.640]  been opening speaker for all of trump's speeches and you know i gave a speech about all of that and
[3:48:30.640 --> 3:48:35.440]  how great my career has been in god bless america and only in america could have put your son be
[3:48:35.440 --> 3:48:41.440]  friends with the president united states and uh afterwards at almost every one of the 24 came
[3:48:41.440 --> 3:48:47.200]  up to me you know maybe 22 of the 24 came up and said they always whisper i was called trump the
[3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:51.760]  whisper vote right and nobody wants to say out loud they're a fan of trump they all whispered
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:56.640]  wane that was great i'm with you everyone was with me but they whispered it because they were
[3:48:56.640 --> 3:49:01.440]  afraid the next guy would hear and the next guy is not with you right but 22 out of 24
[3:49:01.440 --> 3:49:06.240]  whispered we're with you and you know what the other two said not one person said a bad word
[3:49:06.240 --> 3:49:12.160]  about trump the other two came up to me and and said to me i don't really like trump that much
[3:49:12.160 --> 3:49:18.160]  but i'd vote for you so that was kind of interesting i won over all 24 with my speech about how great
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:22.880]  america is and how much i love immigrants but only legal immigrants who want to work and don't
[3:49:22.880 --> 3:49:27.920]  want welfare and speak english and don't want to bring their entire family over 50 other members
[3:49:27.920 --> 3:49:32.480]  who want welfare and don't want to work they love that speech and they love what i was saying so
[3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:37.520]  everyone there was on my side and i think that's really cool so there's nothing globalist about
[3:49:37.520 --> 3:49:43.600]  it i'm a fighter i'm a warrior i should be knighted and i should have a sword because that's what i do
[3:49:43.600 --> 3:49:47.280]  i fight all day long all right enough for the nighting enough for the nighting get rid of the
[3:49:47.280 --> 3:49:54.000]  video let's go on to more important stuff which is covet i want to talk about covet so the president
[3:49:54.000 --> 3:49:59.920]  of the european pharmaceutical giant named farm up mar and i might have mentioned this last week
[3:49:59.920 --> 3:50:03.600]  but it's so important i want to bring it up again in the context of what i'm talking about
[3:50:03.600 --> 3:50:08.480]  he's the president one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in europe and he lied about his
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:14.880]  covet vaccine status he took a shot of salt water instead of the covet vaccine and he bought a fake
[3:50:14.880 --> 3:50:20.240]  covet vaccine card so he could travel and i believe this is happening all over the united
[3:50:20.240 --> 3:50:24.320]  states all over the world that happened to happen in europe i believe it's happening everywhere in
[3:50:24.320 --> 3:50:31.520]  the united states that happened in spain and they caught 2200 other celebrities and elitists and
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:38.720]  ceo's the biggest people in spanish society who all had fake vaccine cards see i'm not a fraud
[3:50:38.720 --> 3:50:44.560]  i've never bought a fake vaccine card i've never shown anyone a fake vaccine card i've said from
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:49.680]  day one i'm not taking the vaccine i will never take the vaccine you'll have to force this vaccine
[3:50:49.680 --> 3:50:57.040]  on me and my family with my cold dead hands you're not giving me the vaccine so i'd be a hypocrite
[3:50:57.040 --> 3:51:01.280]  if then i boarded an airplane to go somewhere where you're required a vaccine and i showed
[3:51:01.280 --> 3:51:07.600]  him a fake card i don't do i don't roll that way i don't play that way that's not my game so i don't
[3:51:07.600 --> 3:51:13.440]  get fake cards i tell people up front on national tv and national radio no vaccine for me there's
[3:51:13.440 --> 3:51:20.880]  the guy who was arrested for fake vaccines so doesn't that make you think if they all know
[3:51:20.880 --> 3:51:25.920]  including the ceo of the pharma company that they don't want the vaccine but they're pushing it on you
[3:51:25.920 --> 3:51:33.200]  and saying it's fine and we happen to know that the vaccine trials before they ever put it out
[3:51:33.200 --> 3:51:39.280]  showed lots of people died lots of people were injured lots of babies died pregnant women miscarried
[3:51:39.280 --> 3:51:45.520]  and even a baby who was breastfeeding died and several mothers reported breastfeeding their
[3:51:45.520 --> 3:51:52.320]  babies and that the milk came out of their breasts blue green colored folks this is a disaster of
[3:51:52.320 --> 3:51:57.040]  epic proportions you know somebody i'll look up a text somebody one of my good buddies
[3:51:57.680 --> 3:52:02.800]  darin just texted me a few minutes ago in the break of the show and he asked me you know if i
[3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:09.760]  had to predict what's going to happen with the covid vaccine here was my answer lots of deaths mass
[3:52:09.760 --> 3:52:17.120]  deaths aka mass murder because they all knew and they let it happen so they could get rich mass
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:24.560]  murder plus let's forget about the covid vaccines and all the death riots coming massive fruit
[3:52:24.560 --> 3:52:30.640]  shortage coming gas at ten dollars a gallon coming collapsing economy coming happy now
[3:52:30.640 --> 3:52:38.080]  there's the truth mark it down i predicted it all i called it all you'll be calling you a soothsayer
[3:52:39.440 --> 3:52:46.320]  and no sooner i say that and there's a dhs uh dhs department of homeland security bulletin
[3:52:46.320 --> 3:52:53.600]  out this morning warning of heightened threat environment and violent months ahead you know
[3:52:53.600 --> 3:52:58.800]  why they know that because they're the ones causing it it's like bill clinton when he said
[3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:04.000]  i feel your pain and i used to joke i used to be a regular guest in those days on abc's politically
[3:53:04.000 --> 3:53:09.600]  correct uh politically incorrect with bill marr and they say bill bill clinton feels your pain
[3:53:09.600 --> 3:53:14.080]  because he's the one causing it and that's they know there's heightened violence ahead
[3:53:14.080 --> 3:53:20.160]  because it isn't the right causing the violence it's them causing it it's the left it's it defants
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:27.280]  blm and it's the government it's homeland security and the cia and the doj and the fbi
[3:53:27.280 --> 3:53:32.320]  who want to arrest patriots and call them terrorists well they let other people go they
[3:53:32.320 --> 3:53:38.560]  want to arrest peter navarro who negotiated trade the trade deal with china and mexico
[3:53:38.560 --> 3:53:44.400]  and canada one of the most important men in america for the american economy and they shackled him
[3:53:44.400 --> 3:53:51.120]  and stuck him in a jail cell that used to be john hinkley's jail cell when he was under arrest
[3:53:51.120 --> 3:53:56.240]  for attempting to assassinate president reagan the president united states they put him in hinkley's
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:54:02.000]  jail cell okay and they put him in shackles at the airport and took him away in front of everybody
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:09.440]  with leg irons and hands cuffs my god he's 72 years old never done anything wrong in his life
[3:54:11.440 --> 3:54:18.000]  john hinkley's out after trying to murder reagan and shooting two other people who had brain damage
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:26.800]  and major medical problems the rest of their lives he's out his records cleared but they're
[3:54:26.800 --> 3:54:31.600]  putting peter navarro in his jail cell who is the trade representative of the united states of america
[3:54:31.600 --> 3:54:36.320]  and right hand man to president trump you don't think that's nazi behavior by the way you don't
[3:54:36.320 --> 3:54:42.640]  think that's the sova union that's not the kgb that's not the east german stasi this isn't reminiscent
[3:54:42.640 --> 3:54:47.920]  to things that happen it's not the holocaust but it's like nazi germany the propaganda the
[3:54:47.920 --> 3:54:52.960]  lies the fraud the deceit the the uh media tied in with the government and the government
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:54:59.600]  persecuting patriots who don't like what the government says wanted to disallow speech or
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:06.400]  arrest you for speaking out against them by the way peter navarro was arrested the day after stating
[3:55:06.400 --> 3:55:11.520]  when the republicans win back the house i will help them to lead the impeach against joe biden
[3:55:11.520 --> 3:55:18.240]  he was arrested the next day this is crazy that we're allowing this to happen oh did i forget to
[3:55:18.240 --> 3:55:24.560]  mention that killer after killer the two lawyers that threw a molotov cocktail into a police car
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:30.480]  and tried to fry two policemen to death in york city during the blm riots they gave them a very
[3:55:30.480 --> 3:55:34.880]  reduced sentence i think they're gonna spend a year in jail and did i mention that the guy
[3:55:34.880 --> 3:55:40.240]  who killed is it kate steinley i'm just going by memory the girl kate the beautiful blonde
[3:55:40.240 --> 3:55:46.640]  on the on the pier in san francisco like seven years ago he shot her dead and he's an illegal
[3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:52.320]  immigrant who'd been deported five times and committed countless crimes and he shot her dead
[3:55:52.320 --> 3:55:57.600]  this beautiful girl bled to death in her father's arms i think it was kate steinley but i know it's
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:03.680]  kate and this criminal this piece of human garbage this scumbag that she put a hell in rot
[3:56:03.680 --> 3:56:09.120]  with satan in hell they gave him time served so he's only gonna spend like a year in jail
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:14.080]  and they let him out but they're putting republicans in jail for our political beliefs and they're
[3:56:14.080 --> 3:56:19.280]  putting january sixers they're letting them rot in solitary they didn't even enter the capital
[3:56:19.280 --> 3:56:24.320]  building and they're charging them with sedition and being traders when they weren't even there
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:28.720]  at the capital building there's a guy who's in charge of the proud boys and they're just charging
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:34.000]  him we found out today with sedition i believe is the term and treason and 20 other charges
[3:56:34.000 --> 3:56:40.000]  and he wasn't even at the capital building i i don't know how to describe how i feel about
[3:56:40.000 --> 3:56:47.040]  what's happening except that the left is filled with communist radical communist traders to the
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:52.560]  united states of america and they're coming to take us over and they're trying to destroy us
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:56.560]  and by the way i need to get to finish my covet columns but that's okay i'm writing a big column

[3:57:06.560 --> 3:57:12.320]  is one way to fight the left that i think is very effective it's copying the uh uh civil disobedience
