[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:04.591]  I believe John Roberts is the one that leaked the draft.
[00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:11.093]  We know he's compromised and blackmailed and basically a deep stater Democrat posing as a Republican.
[00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:21.378]  We know that since February of last year it's come out he sat on the Supreme Court ruling using the power of a Chief Justice to block the court from ruling.
[00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.960]  They began to get very upset about it the last year and so now it's been leaked.
[00:00:28.035 --> 00:00:45.811]  To not make Americans come together against the mask mandates, the forced injections, the open borders, and the inflation, and the wars, and the pedophilia, and all the rest of it, but to make everybody fight going into the election about abortion, which is just going to be given back to the states to deal with anyways.
[00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:47.493]  Doesn't even get rid of it.
[00:00:48.274 --> 00:00:50.376]  Though it does curtail it, and it's a constitutional move.
[00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.058]  And if I had a suspect, it would be him.
[00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:53.779]  His minions.
[00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:01.211]  And now he's the one, of course, running the investigation, just like Fauci launched with Bill Gates and Peter Daszak the bio-attack.
[00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:06.355]  And then they're the ones in charge of the investigation.
[00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:09.316]  And so that's where we are.
[00:01:09.557 --> 00:01:25.934]   And the same people like Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch and all those corrupt, evil things have one of their minions, Garland, in there, who will preside over making sure that federal law enforcement doesn't get in the way of the
[00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:28.494]  ongoing coup against the American people.
[00:01:28.494 --> 00:01:42.495]   Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:53.055]  [Music]
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.500]  Therapists in the U.S.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.182]  say they are seeing increasing numbers of patients with what they call Donald Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:01.863]  Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:03.944]  Trump Derangement Syndrome.
[00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:10.406]  Trump Derangement Syndrome is clinically real.
[00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:16.808]  It doesn't merely affect individuals, but entire political parties, rendering them unrecognizable.
[00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:18.748]  One minute, they're perfectly normal.
[00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:20.608]  The next RABBIT.
[00:02:20.608 --> 00:02:27.608]  The veneer of civilization is evaporating quickly.
[00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.814]  Families and culture are collapsing.
[00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:35.854]   And godless leftists are behaving just like zombies of modern lore.
[00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:40.492]  You can't trust your mother.
[00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.694]  Get the hell out of here!
[00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.653]  Get the fuck out of here!
[00:02:42.807 --> 00:02:44.088]  Get the fuck out of here!
[00:02:44.188 --> 00:02:44.969]  Your best friend.
[00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.670]  Get that camera out of my face!
[00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.131]  The neighbor next door.
[00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:54.335]  Psychologist Dr. Stuart Bassman says, for his clients, it started the morning after the election.
[00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:58.678]  Doctors are seeing patients suffering from Trump Anxiety Disorder.
[00:02:58.698 --> 00:03:04.642]  A number of people are manifesting what I would call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
[00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:10.306]  An overpowering fear that President Trump represents the end of the world.
[00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.907]  Prey.
[00:03:16.028 --> 00:03:17.828]  It doesn't happen to you.
[00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:19.488]  Land of the dead!
[00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.889]  Revit.
[00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.269]  Rabbit.
[00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.269]  [music]
[00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.769]  [groaning]
[00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.269]  White nails.
[00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.269]  [groaning]
[00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:42.269]  [music]
[00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.269]  [screaming]
[00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:52.269]  [music]
[00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.269]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.149]   ♪ They're a little devout to absolute ♪ Never!
[00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.093]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:04.574]  No!
[00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:17.166]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:04:18.496 --> 00:04:19.297]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:28.506]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:32.346]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:44.346]   He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.300]  Prison Planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.800]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group at all.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.300]   He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.880]  (upbeat music)
[00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:08.289]  They falsely edit him.
[00:05:08.329 --> 00:05:12.292]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:05:12.352 --> 00:05:18.276]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:05:18.436 --> 00:05:22.940]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:05:24.472 --> 00:05:28.895]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:05:29.255 --> 00:05:32.597]  And then we get hit and say, you can no longer use our software.
[00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:35.459]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.560]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.561]  They just killed our stream.
[00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:39.982]  Really?
[00:05:40.102 --> 00:05:40.382]  Yep.
[00:05:40.482 --> 00:05:43.063]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:45.825]  This is America in 2018.
[00:05:48.888 --> 00:05:54.331]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:05:56.532 --> 00:05:57.732]  Will you do nothing?
[00:05:58.673 --> 00:06:02.715]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[00:06:03.455 --> 00:06:10.399]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.362]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.035 --> 00:06:21.643]  My friends, it's Monday, May 9th.
[00:06:22.446 --> 00:06:23.108]  The year is 2022.
[00:06:25.532 --> 00:06:26.613]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.653 --> 00:06:28.754]  We've got a really big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:06:28.774 --> 00:06:36.117]  And I had some guests, but I went ahead and cancelled them, or moved them, because I want to take a lot of calls today on a host of big issues, obviously.
[00:06:36.177 --> 00:06:42.780]  The economy, the globalist assaults, the new lockdowns they're preparing, the UN taking over all the major healthcare, and more.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:50.644]  Well, there's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen, that we are on the very front lines in the fight for a human future against the transhumanist technocrats.
[00:06:51.704 --> 00:07:01.447]   I have more videos and more statements Calling for world government, calling for the UN and private corporations to control every facet of your body and your medical life.
[00:07:02.928 --> 00:07:10.472]  We have major publications in the UK saying it's time to publish Britain's 5 million vaccine refuseniks.
[00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:17.575]  It's time to punish Britain's 5 million vaccine refuseniks.
[00:07:19.696 --> 00:07:21.317]  It's really incredible.
[00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:25.772]  Times to be alive and to have this type of stuff unfolding.
[00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:34.059]  And it really shows the type of authoritarian future that we are already living in.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.144]  This is no longer near future.
[00:07:41.506 --> 00:07:43.508]  This is happening now.
[00:07:45.253 --> 00:07:55.500]  We have Yuval Noah Harari saying this is the end of democracy, a new clip, the end of free will, the end of the free market as you know it, just prepare to be a slave.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:02.045]  And that's who they celebrate as the futurist at the Davos Group.
[00:08:03.005 --> 00:08:09.230]  And there's lots of videos coming out of Switzerland right now where they're all meeting on a mountaintop.
[00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:21.019]  With the World Economic Forum and the UN signing an agreement last week that basically the World Economic Forum or the public arm of the Bilderberg Group now publicly directs the United Nations.
[00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:33.670]  There's a new revised WHO agreement that openly moves to give Bill Gates and the head of the World Health Organization de facto pandemic and surveillance.
[00:08:34.813 --> 00:08:39.217]  And governing power over 198 member states in the event of the next pandemic.
[00:08:39.837 --> 00:08:42.059]  If that doesn't frighten you, I don't know what will.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:48.385]  Because Bill Gates has been rubbing his hands together, saying the next virus will be much worse.
[00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:53.509]  And you know he loves to brag about what he and his cohorts are doing to you.
[00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:58.053]  This is biological warfare against the people of the world.
[00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.814]  And we have a right and we have a duty to defend ourselves from this.
[00:09:05.774 --> 00:09:13.960]  The question is how do we do it without triggering a worldwide civil war, which they will also use to collapse civilization and cover up their bio-attack.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.144]  This has got to be done very, very delicately, as they say.
[00:09:19.164 --> 00:09:26.690]  And the biggest part of that is awakening the human mind and psyche to the psychotic depopulationist.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:44.454]  Why do you think so many movies, including James Bond movies, and The Kingsman, and just countless others, Logan's Run, Czardas, there's so many.
[00:09:47.076 --> 00:09:49.678]  Twelve Monkeys, there's hundreds.
[00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.223]  Talk about global elites wanting to release a virus to depopulate you.
[00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:04.233]  Because that's really their operating system, and everybody in Hollywood knows it, and if you want to be part of the club, you've got to go along with that idea.
[00:10:04.573 --> 00:10:13.157]  So they tell you through the movies, but this isn't a 1960s movie, or a 1970s movie, or a 1980s movie, or a movie in the 90s and the 2000s.
[00:10:14.818 --> 00:10:21.681]  This is the real planet that we live on, and this is happening now.
[00:10:24.922 --> 00:10:47.587]   But the real model They're gonna use for control over a city population is going to be a mix of Brave New World, THX 1138, 1984, and of course, Children of Men.
[00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:54.609]  If you haven't seen Children of Men, you'll need to see it.
[00:10:55.725 --> 00:10:57.626]  We're telling you exactly what they're going to do there.
[00:10:58.707 --> 00:11:02.689]  A chemical in the water supply that sterilizes you.
[00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:18.918]  But so that they can't pinpoint one thing, they hit you with chemicals in the water that sterilize a large percentage, injections that sterilize a large percentage, GMOs that sterilize, aluminum dioxide, aerosol spraying.
[00:11:21.007 --> 00:11:36.695]  And all of it is having the effect on fish, and amphibians, and mammals, and on those that study ornithology, we'll tell you, the birds, where their fertility's way down, and their mutations are way up.
[00:11:37.535 --> 00:12:12.059]   And the same thing's happening when you go on a trip in the summer, or in the spring, and you live in places that have a lot of bugs, like Minnesota, or Texas, or Florida, And just 25 years ago, when I would drive to our family ranch in East Texas in the spring or summer, I would have to pull over repeatedly and get a squeegee at a gas station in a three and a half hour trip, and squeegee dead bugs off, or they would harden like hardened egg if you leave it in the bottom of a plate.
[00:12:12.799 --> 00:12:13.779]  You know how hard it is to get out?
[00:12:14.239 --> 00:12:16.980]  Their guts would harden on the windshield.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:27.850]   Now, I can drive in the spring or summer in Texas, and there might be one bug on my windshield.
[00:12:29.651 --> 00:12:29.991]  One bug.
[00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:38.735]  Remember, if you're old enough to remember, if you're more than 30, 40 years old, and we're driving just 25 years ago, it all started about 25 years ago.
[00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:45.258]  Remember the grill of your truck would just be full of just bugs?
[00:12:46.018 --> 00:12:46.619]  Piles of them.
[00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:49.100]  You had to put gloves on and get them out of there.
[00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.010]  Not anymore?
[00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.692]  I want to ask yourselves why that's happening.
[00:12:56.472 --> 00:12:58.113]  And in this is the key to everything.
[00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:01.475]  The globalists are not just killing off the humans.
[00:13:03.576 --> 00:13:07.858]  They have a plan to overwrite all life on earth and create a new silicon life form that will live on this planet.
[00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:10.859]  Now you can say it's an alien takeover.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.781]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:13:15.939 --> 00:13:17.580]  I don't know who's running it.
[00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:20.763]  I don't know what, if it's a species.
[00:13:21.524 --> 00:13:22.345]  I'm not debating all that.
[00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:37.978]  I'm saying you can extrapolate out logically and listen to all the globalists saying humans are bad, we're going to get rid of humans, post-human world, looking forward to the end of humans, there'll be no more humans in 2045, we're going to depopulate the earth by 2030, and we're going to become gods and emerging machines.
[00:13:38.138 --> 00:13:39.640]  They believe they're the aliens.
[00:13:43.541 --> 00:13:57.345]  If I cover all this other news, and I will, the war in Ukraine escalating out of control, and the suppression of National Citizen's film 2000 Mules that totally proves how they carried out the election fraud, and so much more today.
[00:13:57.385 --> 00:13:59.626]  And we're going to take phone calls throughout the four hours.
[00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:16.326]   But you've got to read the Bible about a fallen entity on the planet that's eternal, that hates us because we're related, To the all-powerful, omnipresent being that marooned it here.
[00:14:17.751 --> 00:14:26.775]  And it is angry at us and it is attacking us and manipulating us and trying to get us to give up our humanity and give up our souls.
[00:14:27.115 --> 00:14:45.903]  And you can look back and say, well, that's just a book in the Bible that predicted a world government with ten kingdoms and flying ships and just everything you see and a mark in the hand and forehead to buy and sell and the breakup of the family and everything that's happening exactly as it's happening.
[00:14:48.587 --> 00:15:04.993]  I sat there in the 1980s going to Evangelical church and Baptist churches and you name it, my parents, and I remember seeing the preacher sit up there and give two-hour sermons, word for word, what is now unfolding.
[00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.035]  And then he got this, Houston Chronicle.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.363]  NASA wants to send nudes to space in order to attract aliens.
[00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:21.267]  They've already been doing it, beaming on images of naked humans and our DNA sequence.
[00:15:22.428 --> 00:15:24.589]  What are you, like, trying to send out the menu or whatever?
[00:15:24.609 --> 00:15:55.677]   So see, the globalists have got their whole world, and how they believe they're mad scientists who will become gods, and we're down here, Watching sitcoms designed to dumb us down and watching sports, and I'm not judging any of you, hell I've done it myself, but it's still at the end of the day is a distraction from the real mystery of this planet and what we're doing here and what we're meant to be and what we're meant to do.
[00:15:57.118 --> 00:16:01.981]  And the fact that we were given a cheat sheet on how to survive this and thrive in this and transcend it.
[00:16:03.516 --> 00:16:04.537]  We got a huge broadcast.
[00:16:04.557 --> 00:16:05.838]  I'm going to give the number out next segment.
[00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:07.859]  I'm taking a hundred phone calls today.
[00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:11.061]  InfoWars.com, the tip of the spear.
[00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:22.988]  All right, I want to get into the unbelievable situation that is deteriorating quickly in Ukraine.
[00:16:24.529 --> 00:16:27.751]  I want to get into the Dow Jones plunging over 300 points, what's happening in crypto.
[00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:40.322]  I want to get into Bill Gates not just announcing that you're going to drink sewage water and eat bugs, but now he's got synthetic lab-grown milk for babies.
[00:16:40.362 --> 00:16:41.743]  Wait to hear about the details of that.
[00:16:43.304 --> 00:16:46.906]  Also massive electricity shortages in Europe and the U.S.
[00:16:46.946 --> 00:17:02.505]   and their answer is shut down more of the plants that supply the electricity while forcing us off oil, but also not letting us have enough electricity From other sources while pushing people onto electric cars.
[00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:08.369]  We've got all of that coming up today and more.
[00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:17.815]  But the first thing I want to hit is this because it's really important to you and to myself and everybody but particularly InfoWars.
[00:17:21.978 --> 00:17:28.437]   We've talked to a lot of the lawyers They're representing January 6th, political prisoners.
[00:17:29.317 --> 00:17:34.018]  Almost all of them are just completely innocent of anything.
[00:17:34.038 --> 00:17:40.420]  And then those that are guilty are just guilty of going into a building and maybe getting in a shoving match with the police.
[00:17:44.001 --> 00:18:00.136]   But having that knowledge, but also researching this on a daily basis, and having my background knowledge of the deep state and knowing that the same FBI provocateur false flag team that ran the fake Whitmer kidnapping operation that was then transferred to run January 6th.
[00:18:00.696 --> 00:18:12.287]  We know that thing was a giant honeypot that we were all lured into, that the Capitol Police were ordered to stand down, that half their numbers were sent away that day, that Trump's request for 10,000 National Guard was refused.
[00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:21.368]   He could have overridden it, but Milley threatened to quit if he did.
[00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:28.928]   And so now we know it's really important because they are running on it in the midterms in
[00:18:28.928 --> 00:18:30.007]  183 days.
[00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:40.007]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:31.784 --> 00:18:49.776]  Washington Post articles, Wall Street Journal articles, New York Times articles this weekend that specifically say the committee is honing in on Roger Stone and Alex Jones for working with Trump and directing people to attack the Capitol.
[00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:53.868]  100% BS.
[00:18:54.989 --> 00:18:55.869]  A, we don't have a motive.
[00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:56.950]  It made us look like fools.
[00:18:58.811 --> 00:19:00.592]  B, there's no evidence of it because it's not true.
[00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:14.340]  And C, I wasn't talking to President Trump for over a year before that ever happened and Roger Stone was not involved in any of the planning of even our legal lawful events on the 5th or the 6th.
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:27.827]  Just incredible that they're trying to demonize lawful First Amendment activities and then I see the same headlines everywhere they've run against me.
[00:19:29.408 --> 00:19:36.874]  Oath keepers are talking to prosecutors and they're exposing their communications and it's going to go all the way up to Trump.
[00:19:38.735 --> 00:19:41.377]  They might as well say their communications with the Martians.
[00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:53.917]   And then I know the individuals that They're talking about, because I've seen them in the press, I've met some of them, and I like Oath Keepers overall.
[00:19:53.937 --> 00:19:57.677]  I think they had a good mission to promote following your oath.
[00:19:57.717 --> 00:19:59.158]  They did great work for over a decade.
[00:19:59.178 --> 00:20:01.718]  I think some bad things happened on January 6th, we're not sure.
[00:20:02.078 --> 00:20:04.339]  All the specifics, but we know it was a honeypot provocateur.
[00:20:05.099 --> 00:20:16.682]  But I know some of the people they're quoting here as saying they're talking to the feds and they're going to expose the chain of command.
[00:20:17.932 --> 00:20:23.597]  And I just find it hard to believe that those people would actually make stuff up and lie.
[00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:27.900]  But I'm not worried about it because I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:20:29.021 --> 00:20:41.331]  But it is in hundreds of publications a week, conservatively, it's on national TV every day on one channel or another, that I'm going to jail and Roger Stone's going to jail and all the rest of this.
[00:20:42.332 --> 00:20:43.773]  And it is a bizarre feeling.
[00:20:47.426 --> 00:20:54.792]  To know you did nothing wrong, to know there's no evidence you did anything wrong, to know that you had no motive, and to know that you tried to stop what happened.
[00:20:55.832 --> 00:20:59.455]  And quite frankly, I'm not asking for a medal, but everybody else just stood there.
[00:21:00.195 --> 00:21:15.707]  And then the thousand undercover FBI agents and hostage rescue team people that were there on record sat there while I tried to stop what was happening when I got there in the middle of it, and I didn't turn thousands away from going in, and sat there with their thumbs in their mouths.
[00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:16.628]  Or worse.
[00:21:17.884 --> 00:21:27.008]  And so it just, it really infuriates me that they bare minimum knew there were some groups planning to go in there and get somewhat violent.
[00:21:28.328 --> 00:21:31.209]  Democrats do it all the time in other capitals, but I agree it's not a good thing.
[00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:45.275]  And the evidence is overwhelming, went ahead and actually helped provocateur and get the whole thing started while they then watched me show up in the middle of it with my crew and get tear gas at a distance and try to stop it.
[00:21:47.403 --> 00:22:05.180]  And then they got the nerve, not just at the January 6th committee, but they got two different FBI, Justice Department teams, they admitted this to us, trying to make a fake case and indict me.
[00:22:07.662 --> 00:22:16.663]   And then the cherry on top is they then Leaked through the press lies that, oh, I'm coming out of the dark.
[00:22:17.323 --> 00:22:18.424]  I'm coming in out of the cold.
[00:22:18.945 --> 00:22:20.266]  I'm going to tell them everything.
[00:22:20.726 --> 00:22:28.312]  I'm going to rat Trump out and all this made up stuff, because they were calling us over and over again for months, asking us to come meet with them.
[00:22:28.332 --> 00:22:29.073]  And I said, no.
[00:22:30.914 --> 00:22:32.496]  They said, well, what did we come to you?
[00:22:32.896 --> 00:22:35.098]  I said, well, why don't you drop your fake charges and own Schroyer?
[00:22:37.602 --> 00:22:38.763]  Why don't you give me written questions?
[00:22:38.783 --> 00:22:39.563]  I have nothing to hide.
[00:22:39.903 --> 00:22:50.288]  But I'm not gonna get in a perjury trap where they get some lying stool pigeon to say I did one thing and then they say I lie when I'm not lying so they can indict me like Martha Stewart.
[00:22:50.488 --> 00:22:51.569]  You think I'm stupid?
[00:22:51.949 --> 00:22:53.870]  I mean, I'm not that smart, but I'm not an idiot.
[00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:55.531]  You are a discredited...
[00:22:56.431 --> 00:23:07.954]  Government agency that ran fast and furious and shipped tens of thousands of guns into Mexico, on record to blame the Second Amendment in America, so now Mexico could sue gun makers, which they're doing.
[00:23:07.974 --> 00:23:11.836]  And then a bunch of the guns got shipped to ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
[00:23:12.136 --> 00:23:12.756]  That's all come out.
[00:23:17.157 --> 00:23:27.260]   El Chapo's .50 Cal sold Through that operation where the ATF false flagged.
[00:23:27.661 --> 00:23:33.984]  I mean, to try to list the crimes of this government and the criminals that have taken it over would take hours, but it's just too rich.
[00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:36.166]  It's just, it's, it's, it's too much.
[00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:38.187]  But here's why listeners need to care.
[00:23:40.248 --> 00:23:52.595]  They're now saying the Justice Department and the Capitol Police that there are imminent terror attacks on Supreme Court justices and on, and on members of Congress and on others.
[00:23:54.634 --> 00:24:16.400]   While Democrats firebomb buildings and burn things down and attack things and beat people up and violently protest outside Supreme Court justice houses, the corporate media and the government gestapo, the brown shirts, the Praetorian, They are saying that we the people, the populace are the ones that are going to be violent, which again means they're priming the false flag.
[00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:17.902]  False flag alert.
[00:24:18.202 --> 00:24:20.324]  False flags be blamed on patriots imminent.
[00:24:21.044 --> 00:24:21.965]  We are on the march.
[00:24:22.585 --> 00:24:24.187]  The corrupt empire is on the run.
[00:24:25.148 --> 00:24:26.449]  All right, I'm going to give the number out.
[00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:31.613]  I'm going to start taking calls next segment on any issue, any subject you want to raise.
[00:24:31.713 --> 00:24:35.016]  I love the wildcard nature of it.
[00:24:37.362 --> 00:24:43.887]  The number is 877-789-2539.
[00:24:43.907 --> 00:24:46.789]  877-789-Alex.
[00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.654]  And we can have long-time callers, first-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree.
[00:24:52.694 --> 00:24:56.377]  All I ask is you have a clean, crisp telephone line.
[00:24:56.397 --> 00:24:56.437]  877-789-2539.
[00:24:56.616 --> 00:25:06.856]   877-789-2539. Alright, let me get back to the permanent bureaucracy, the permanent state,
[00:25:06.856 --> 00:25:12.296]   the deep state, those are all academic names that go back more than 40 years for what is
[00:25:12.296 --> 00:25:13.257]  inside the system.
[00:25:13.257 --> 00:25:25.990]   And And when I would talk about that 25 years ago, the media would say he's insane, there's no such thing as a deep state, there's no such thing as a stay-behind network, there's no such thing as any of this.
[00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:32.556]  They have meetings on television on C-SPAN with Brennan and Clapper.
[00:25:32.616 --> 00:25:35.879]  You remember those a few years ago where they said, Trump will be gone.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.822]  We have the bureaucracy and we're going to have a coup and we're moving.
[00:25:42.585 --> 00:25:53.574]  And they were doing that to show their power and exercise their power for their gangs, to encourage their gangs inside the government and corporations and the judiciary and media.
[00:25:55.307 --> 00:25:58.790]  To break the law, to do whatever they wanted, to leak information, you name it.
[00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:06.217]  And that's what you see now is populists and Christians and conservatives aren't breaking the law.
[00:26:06.798 --> 00:26:08.159]  We're not leaking information.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.622]  We are not doing dirty tricks, and I'm not saying we should.
[00:26:13.243 --> 00:26:21.592]  While they, on the other side, are doing anything and everything they want, however they want, and they never get in any trouble for it.
[00:26:21.632 --> 00:26:24.675]  So, how do we not sink to their level at the same time?
[00:26:24.735 --> 00:26:25.016]  Beat them.
[00:26:26.547 --> 00:26:42.691]  We expose them and let people know the reason they're going bankrupt, the reason their dollar's devalued, the reason their borders are wide open, the reason there's all this pedophilia going on, is because these are predatory, very bad, wicked people that want to crash the world economy for depopulation.
[00:26:43.211 --> 00:26:50.873]  And everything else horrible and evil they do that they enjoy is just part of the enjoyment of getting to where they're trying to go.
[00:26:53.193 --> 00:26:55.834]  So getting back to where we are, there's all these headlines everywhere.
[00:26:57.006 --> 00:26:58.987]  Oath keepers are talking to the feds.
[00:26:59.768 --> 00:27:05.811]  Oath keepers are discussing with the feds, conversations with Trump, stuff like this.
[00:27:06.492 --> 00:27:15.597]  When none of that happened, none of that went on, and then the controlled left goes, look, Jones is protecting the Don, his mafia boss.
[00:27:16.137 --> 00:27:16.497]  Why?
[00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:20.680]  He's saying that he didn't, because it's a lie.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.541]  That's why I'm not protecting Trump.
[00:27:25.646 --> 00:27:30.028]  But if they're able to demonize and lie about Trump, they're going to be able to demonize the American people.
[00:27:30.428 --> 00:27:40.353]  They're branding, all demonstrating, all protesting, open borders, gun control, election fraud, lockdowns, forced injections, as terrorists.
[00:27:41.694 --> 00:27:50.678]  They're trying to brand all opposition in America as terrorism and really bring us into a full-bore, authoritarian, top-down police state.
[00:27:50.718 --> 00:27:52.179]  We aren't getting there.
[00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:54.140]  We are deep inside of it now.
[00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.482]  Complete with a ministry of truth?
[00:27:59.382 --> 00:28:01.843]  With censors and surveillance and all the controls?
[00:28:03.323 --> 00:28:05.424]  When America does something, it does it big.
[00:28:06.144 --> 00:28:08.025]  And boy, are we doing it big here.
[00:28:08.205 --> 00:28:12.286]  So, when I see these headlines, I don't believe them.
[00:28:16.207 --> 00:28:21.589]  Now, may there be some fake informants inside the Oath Keepers that were there all along?
[00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:28.473]  That will now speak for the Oath Keepers and help direct them into their prison cells?
[00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:30.813]  Yes, there's no doubt that's happening.
[00:28:31.494 --> 00:28:40.696]  But I know when I see headlines that the Oath Keepers are running around lying about people, I don't believe it.
[00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:43.736]  And you know why I don't believe it?
[00:28:45.197 --> 00:28:55.524]   Because the same Media that's saying that says I called the feds a month ago and said I've got information but give me immunity and I'll tell you what really happened.
[00:28:55.584 --> 00:28:55.804]  No!
[00:28:56.165 --> 00:29:01.407]  They came to me and said we want to talk to you and I said give me total immunity so you can't make up stuff and charge me with perjury.
[00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:03.969]  And we told them there is no information.
[00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:05.409]  Everything we've said is on record.
[00:29:05.449 --> 00:29:06.350]  It's all been true.
[00:29:09.131 --> 00:29:10.012]  It's all on video.
[00:29:11.288 --> 00:29:12.248]  It's all transparent.
[00:29:12.789 --> 00:29:14.490]  It's all First Amendment protected behavior.
[00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.932]  You guys are disgraceful even following the orders to do this.
[00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:28.917]  And their spin is Alex Jones called the feds and he wants to come tell them what really happened.
[00:29:30.918 --> 00:29:32.879]  And then they have these maps they put out on TV.
[00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:47.521]  That show Trump up at the top, and then Meadows under him, and then Don Jr., and then Roger Stone, and then me, and it goes down, and it's... It's fiction.
[00:29:49.683 --> 00:29:52.265]  Just like it's fiction that the Oath Keepers are a terrorist organization.
[00:29:52.566 --> 00:29:58.652]  You know how many videos we have on Mandovideo that they'll take down off Twitter or Facebook or YouTube because they don't want you to know the truth?
[00:29:58.672 --> 00:29:59.453]  Put it back up, please.
[00:30:01.883 --> 00:30:07.848]  Of the Oath Keepers saving police and trying to stop people going in the building on January 6th.
[00:30:07.868 --> 00:30:10.290]  We just had it on screen for TV viewers.
[00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.210]  We'll put it back up for me.
[00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:12.271]  I'll give it to radio listeners.
[00:30:15.634 --> 00:30:32.394]   But the reason this is so important is because they are framing the American people Just like they're framing the million people that came to D.C.
[00:30:32.935 --> 00:30:39.839]  as terrorists because maybe a couple hundred, mainly provocateurs, got in fistfights with the police and then the police opened the doors.
[00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:47.903]  And based on that, they're trying to roll out their literal re-education camps and their Patriot Act for the American people.
[00:30:50.168 --> 00:30:51.489]  And then that leads us to this.
[00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:59.851]   Obama's AG Eric Holder tells me that while he initially thought indicting former President Trump would be too divisive,
[00:30:59.851 --> 00:31:05.651]   he now thinks there is evidence enough that he should be held accountable for his role in January 6.
[00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:12.050]  And let's not forget.
[00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:22.050]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:31:13.476 --> 00:31:14.976]  Who Eric Holder is.
[00:31:15.697 --> 00:31:22.899]  He got caught running Fast and Furious, hundreds of thousands of guns total, into Mexico, to the drug cartels, and to ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:31:23.539 --> 00:31:24.659]  That all came out in the news.
[00:31:25.319 --> 00:31:33.782]  And now he's climbed out from underneath the rock, and is now saying we need to arrest the President.
[00:31:35.822 --> 00:31:50.794]   Even though he obstructed it, and got caught lying, and all of it came out, now, He wants to escalate the situation by arresting the real president that even the majority of Democrats know really won the election.
[00:31:51.154 --> 00:31:52.455]  You know, take Jill Biden.
[00:31:54.236 --> 00:31:56.477]  Her husband supposedly got more votes than anybody in U.S.
[00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:56.857]  history.
[00:31:59.078 --> 00:31:59.638]  11 million more.
[00:31:59.738 --> 00:32:04.000]  But she can only sell 240 books in the first week of her book coming out.
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:07.821]  240-something books.
[00:32:10.482 --> 00:32:12.203]  Oh, but Donald Trump can sell 10 million.
[00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:15.647]  None of it's true and everybody knows it.
[00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.590]  But here's the Eric Holder comment.
[00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:25.694]  Merrick Garland, you mentioned, he's now in your old job as Attorney General.
[00:32:25.714 --> 00:32:31.919]  There have been critics of him who say that he isn't being aggressive enough around the prosecutions regarding January the 6th.
[00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:33.260]  Do you think that's right?
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.501]  No one knows.
[00:32:34.621 --> 00:32:38.804]  I mean, you know, I have great faith in Merrick and in the people at the Justice Department.
[00:32:39.705 --> 00:32:48.075]  We won't really know how aggressive they have been until they are before a camera and announcing a decision either to indict certain people or not indict certain people.
[00:32:48.095 --> 00:32:48.856]  But here's my prediction.
[00:32:49.537 --> 00:32:57.126]  At some point, people at the Justice Department, perhaps that prosecutor in Atlanta, are going to have to make a determination about whether or not they want to indict Donald Trump.
[00:32:57.486 --> 00:32:57.947]  Would you do it?
[00:32:59.148 --> 00:33:03.992]  Well, I think there's going to be sufficient factual information, and I think that there's going to be sufficient proof of intent.
[00:33:04.473 --> 00:33:08.055]  And then the question becomes, what's the impact of such an indictment?
[00:33:08.075 --> 00:33:09.356]  I'm an institutionalist.
[00:33:09.837 --> 00:33:14.801]  My initial thought was not to indict the former president out of concern of how divisive it would be.
[00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:19.024]  But given what we have learned, I think that he probably has to be held accountable.
[00:33:19.945 --> 00:33:27.131]  What you have learned is that you guys were to stand down and provocateur the operation with the same FBI team that ran the fake Whitmer kidnapping.
[00:33:28.186 --> 00:33:36.754]  We know there was a thousand paramilitary FBI and auxiliaries in the crowd and you did nothing to help those police officers when they were outnumbered by the few hundred thugs.
[00:33:38.575 --> 00:33:44.841]  Your fingerprints are all over just like your fingerprints are all over Oklahoma City and you got caught red-handed and fast and furious.
[00:33:44.661 --> 00:33:50.161]   you're a terrorist, you're a criminal, you're an enemy of this country, Eric Holder,
[00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:53.821]  and you will pay when you are judged by God.
[00:33:53.821 --> 00:33:56.740]  (electronic music)
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:05.680]   The letter from Albert Pike regarding the Illuminati plan for three world wars
[00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:12.200]   is largely considered a hoax due to the use of the word Nazism in a letter dated 1871.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:18.155]   71 But it is interesting to note the desired outcome of this alleged plan.
[00:34:18.835 --> 00:34:30.703]  According to the letter, the Third War officially started on 9-11 and was intended to leave the people in a state of complete physical, moral, spiritual, and economic exhaustion.
[00:34:31.344 --> 00:34:38.889]  They will then use nihilists, atheists, and revolutionaries to create a cataclysm of social turmoil.
[00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:46.394]  And they will do this in order to force the people into exterminating the destroyers of civilization.
[00:34:47.635 --> 00:34:59.223]  According to this letter, this bloodbath would result in the destruction of both Christianity and Atheism, and lead to the pure doctrine of Lucifer as the new world religion.
[00:35:00.583 --> 00:35:12.191]  And it does appear as if this is happening now, as if the powers that be are pushing the people into a desperate corner, as if their main goal is to create mass chaos and violence.
[00:35:14.448 --> 00:35:19.371]  But they've been doing this all by decree because they have no authority over God or the U.S.
[00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:20.212]  Constitution.
[00:35:20.752 --> 00:35:27.677]  And so they'd be thrilled if we burn it all down for them, proving we are inferior savages in need of governance.
[00:35:28.598 --> 00:35:36.023]  They thought they'd have that on January 6th, but the people were there for peace, love, and justice, not a revolution.
[00:35:36.644 --> 00:35:37.564]  We don't need one.
[00:35:38.024 --> 00:35:40.806]  We already have our Declaration of Independence.
[00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:48.390]  But without justice, the death cult remains free and continues on its path to kill us all.
[00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:54.734]  They're going to shut us down again, but this time the United Nations will be in charge.
[00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:58.936]  Our government is giving them that authority at the end of this month.
[00:35:59.756 --> 00:36:02.679]  Just in time for the next international health crisis.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:12.349]  And with the leaked Supreme Court memo on Roe v. Wade, they can launch endless organized riots on us while we remain locked in our homes.
[00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:18.995]  Round two is coming, and this time with food shortages and the crashing dollar.
[00:36:20.652 --> 00:36:22.234]  But it doesn't have to be like this.
[00:36:22.894 --> 00:36:25.417]  Their authority is the biggest psy-op ever.
[00:36:26.037 --> 00:36:28.620]  You are not their slave unless you choose to be.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.142]  They are convincing you to do this to yourself.
[00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:42.113]  When they demanded that everyone wear a mask in 2020, the majority of us could have said no, demanded justice, and the true renaissance would have then begun.
[00:36:43.297 --> 00:36:48.638]  The 2020 lockdown was a beta test to gauge how compliant the population was.
[00:36:49.518 --> 00:36:50.239]  And we failed.
[00:36:50.899 --> 00:36:52.439]  But we will soon have another chance.
[00:36:52.879 --> 00:37:03.922]  And 2020 was also a wake-up call for millions of Americans and millions worldwide who previously had no idea how corrupt our governments had become.
[00:37:05.062 --> 00:37:06.242]  So now we are many.
[00:37:07.242 --> 00:37:10.143]  And we must all prepare for the next lockdown.
[00:37:12.543 --> 00:37:17.265]  And we must remember that we are not savages, sheep, or slaves.
[00:37:17.886 --> 00:37:20.207]  We are human beings with free will.
[00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:30.152]  And as lawful Americans, it is our responsibility to apprehend these traitors, exact justice, and restore the Republic.
[00:37:31.212 --> 00:37:34.074]  But first, we must simply say no.
[00:37:35.194 --> 00:37:36.315]  Say no to the masks.
[00:37:36.915 --> 00:37:38.576]  Say no to sheltering in place.
[00:37:39.297 --> 00:37:41.258]  Say no to vaccine passports.
[00:37:41.818 --> 00:37:44.380]  Say no to shutting down your business or your church.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.902]  And if the police come to shut you down, make them commit treason.
[00:37:49.703 --> 00:37:52.905]  The law of the land is already in the hands of the people.
[00:37:53.485 --> 00:37:56.687]  All we have to do is wake up and take it back together.
[00:37:57.807 --> 00:38:02.030]  Peace, love, and justice is ours, if we want it.
[00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:06.042]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:38:10.224 --> 00:38:14.606]  Alright, I'm going to tell you exactly what's going on, and it's not my opinion, we know.
[00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:20.668]  I believe John Roberts is the one that leaked the draft.
[00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:27.111]  We know he's compromised and blackmailed and basically a deep stater Democrat posing as a Republican.
[00:38:28.274 --> 00:38:37.437]  We know that since February of last year it's come out he sat on the Supreme Court ruling using the power of a Chief Justice to block the court from ruling.
[00:38:38.518 --> 00:38:40.579]  They began to get very upset about it in the last year.
[00:38:41.679 --> 00:38:52.143]  And so now it's been leaked to not make Americans come together against the mask mandates, the forced injections, the open borders, and the inflation, and the wars, and the pedophilia, and all the rest of it.
[00:38:54.024 --> 00:39:01.869]   But to make everybody fight going into the election about abortion Which is just going to be given back to the states to deal with anyways.
[00:39:02.729 --> 00:39:03.529]  Doesn't even get rid of it.
[00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.410]  Though it does curtail it and is a constitutional move.
[00:39:07.231 --> 00:39:09.091]  And if I had a suspect, it would be him.
[00:39:09.331 --> 00:39:09.852]  His minions.
[00:39:11.792 --> 00:39:13.553]  And now he's the one, of course, running the investigation.
[00:39:13.593 --> 00:39:17.314]  Just like Fauci launched with Bill Gates and Peter Daszak the bio-attack.
[00:39:18.074 --> 00:39:22.376]  And then they're the ones in charge of the investigation.
[00:39:24.488 --> 00:39:25.369]  And so that's where we are.
[00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:44.645]  And the same people like Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch and all those corrupt evil things have one of their minions, Garland, in there who will preside over making sure that federal law enforcement doesn't get in the way of the ongoing coup against the American people.
[00:39:46.987 --> 00:39:53.640]   Then the left on the ground will supply all the false flags and events they need. The left will go out and firebomb and
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.460]  attack and then that won't get covered in the press.
[00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.220]   But then you have this coming out getting no national attention.
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:06.700]   Portland journalists who reported on the alt-right for liberal papers arrested over attacks on synagogues and
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.939]   mosques posing as you guessed it a trump supporter.
[00:40:11.939 --> 00:40:15.779]  How many leftists have been caught doing this?
[00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:27.671]  Adam, Kevin, Julio, Yvonne, Justin, Carlos, Marcos, Kami Forte, Rodney, Matt, we're going to all your calls starting now.
[00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:34.792]  Adam, you'll go to you next, but first is Kevin in South Dakota.
[00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:39.533]  Says he was a Jan 6, was there in D.C., and the abortion topic.
[00:40:39.573 --> 00:40:39.873]  Go ahead.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.604]  Hey Alex, I remember coming out on the 5th because I wanted to check to see that I'd have a route.
[00:40:45.684 --> 00:40:49.847]  I thought Antifa would attack us on our way back from the Trump rally.
[00:40:49.887 --> 00:40:52.309]  I thought I'll get a hotel three miles away.
[00:40:52.749 --> 00:41:03.178]  And I came in the night before on the subway, got off at the Supreme Court Station, and as I came out, they cordoned off the area for two miles from the event the night before.
[00:41:03.218 --> 00:41:04.259]  You couldn't even park nearby.
[00:41:04.899 --> 00:41:09.661]  I heard, echoing through the skyscrapers, the dulcet tones of Alex Jones.
[00:41:09.721 --> 00:41:13.522]  I heard you speaking down there at the Freedom Plaza.
[00:41:13.842 --> 00:41:17.043]  And I went there and I saw you and Roger Stone and I was keyed up.
[00:41:17.364 --> 00:41:19.905]  And then I went to the event on January 6th.
[00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:22.545]  I saw two women pushing dogs in strollers.
[00:41:23.026 --> 00:41:25.807]  I saw a man and his wife with a baby over the shoulder.
[00:41:26.107 --> 00:41:32.089]  I saw a bunch of people dressed up like Trump supporters who would cuss and yell and try and rile other people up.
[00:41:32.709 --> 00:41:33.590]  And nothing would happen.
[00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.771]  We'd all just kind of avoid him.
[00:41:34.811 --> 00:41:40.055]  Like, well, that's crazy, but we love Jesus and the country and Trump.
[00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:44.719]  And I saw people with gay Gadsden snake flags and people getting high.
[00:41:44.739 --> 00:41:47.201]  It was like conservative Woodstock, for goodness sake.
[00:41:47.442 --> 00:41:48.402]  And they didn't plan for it.
[00:41:48.643 --> 00:41:50.364]  And they had people on top of the porta-potties.
[00:41:50.404 --> 00:41:52.766]  And I had to climb a tree to see the overflow screen.
[00:41:53.066 --> 00:41:59.772]  So I know that January 6th was a complete false flag operation designed to undermine the right for the purpose.
[00:42:00.613 --> 00:42:05.537]  Of giving the left a talking point and now we see a fodder for the election.
[00:42:05.897 --> 00:42:07.518]  And now they're doing the same thing with the pro-choice.
[00:42:07.738 --> 00:42:18.466]  I got a death threat yesterday from some female to male who called me a scum expletive and told me to die and that they'd be willing to do it and that I need to be made an example of.
[00:42:18.766 --> 00:42:29.214]  Because I'm pro-life and I present my arguments clearly with proper information, facts, and I cite it and they can't stand it because it's cognitive dissonance and they're brainwashed.
[00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:33.044]  And they're the heroes, so they're allowed to be violent.
[00:42:33.184 --> 00:42:36.166]  And we see Catholic churches, churches being attacked everywhere.
[00:42:36.526 --> 00:42:38.007]  I showed a bunch of videos of it last night.
[00:42:38.047 --> 00:42:40.088]  The media acting like it's a good thing.
[00:42:41.129 --> 00:42:46.232]  The White House press secretary saying it's a good thing to dox and go harass Supreme Court justices at their homes.
[00:42:46.633 --> 00:42:52.036]  This is a group of bullying terrorists with the whole corporate media and the federal government on their side.
[00:42:52.116 --> 00:42:53.177]  They are the establishment.
[00:42:53.577 --> 00:42:54.318]  We are the people.
[00:42:54.678 --> 00:43:00.542]  And they were so scared of that diverse crowd of a million people that showed up with maybe a thousand provocateurs inside the whole crowd.
[00:43:01.222 --> 00:43:07.945]  We're going to start the next hour and go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom through your calls and a bunch of other big topics.
[00:43:07.785 --> 00:43:13.624]   paramilitary, sat there in the crowd at the Capitol while I tried to stop it and did nothing.
[00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:16.064]  Shame on them.
[00:43:16.064 --> 00:43:17.544]  Great points, God bless you Kevin.
[00:43:17.544 --> 00:43:21.585]   We're going to start the next hour and go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:43:21.585 --> 00:43:24.785]   boom, boom through your calls and a bunch of other big topics.
[00:43:24.785 --> 00:43:27.585]  Something exciting I forgot to tell you.
[00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:28.504]  It's back in stock.
[00:43:28.883 --> 00:43:30.184]  Sold out for months and months and months.

[00:45:12.847 --> 00:45:27.797]  Attorney generals from 20 conservative states are threatening legal action against the Department of Homeland Security's newly formed Disinformation Governance Board, which they said will have a chilling effect on freedom of expression, and described it as un-American.
[00:45:27.998 --> 00:45:30.699]  Unconstitutional would be the word I would use.
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:41.427]  Now, the good news is, is that almost all the big tech platforms now acknowledge some responsibility for content on their platforms, and they're investing in large teams of people to monitor it.
[00:45:41.627 --> 00:45:49.487]   While content moderation can limit the distribution of clearly dangerous content, It doesn't go far enough.
[00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:55.690]  This MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history.
[00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:16.037]  If it were that simple, it would merely be irony that the Biden administration, led by its chronic serial fabricator-in-chief, is just gonna bypass that worthless old First Amendment and set up an Orwellian ministry of truth led by esteemed disinformation regurgitator Nina Jankowicz.
[00:46:16.297 --> 00:46:40.533]  So what I'm encouraging individuals to do, in particular, just your normal, average, everyday citizen, is to practice informational distancing, where recognizing that disinformation and misinformation often run on emotional manipulation, when you feel your emotions rising, to just walk away from your device for a little bit, let yourself cool down, and then start to consider the source.
[00:46:40.994 --> 00:46:46.057]  Why does that particular source have an interest in emotionally manipulating you?
[00:46:46.838 --> 00:46:50.061]  We're going to begin tonight with that alleged terror plot and the chilling plan.
[00:46:50.101 --> 00:46:53.224]  The FBI says it stopped before it could be carried out.
[00:46:53.724 --> 00:46:58.189]  A plan to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and then what they were planning to do to her.
[00:46:58.829 --> 00:47:03.634]  Thirteen suspects arrested including seven alleged members of a right-wing militia group.
[00:47:03.914 --> 00:47:14.418]  The local four defenders first told you the men charged in the plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer say the men who trained them the entire time were undercover FBI agents.
[00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:29.464]  Now, a new court filing obtained by the defenders, filed by so-called ringleader Adam Fox, says paid FBI informants were also the ones to come up with the plan to kidnap the governor and attack her summer home.
[00:47:29.784 --> 00:47:40.110]  Jenkiewicz has praised the debunked dossier author Christopher Steele and vehemently claimed that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation.
[00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:45.869]   But Jankiewicz's manic zealotry is far more complicated than what appears on the surface.
[00:47:45.869 --> 00:47:58.749]   Jankiewicz's resume reads like a quintessential job application to the
[00:47:58.749 --> 00:48:09.232]   Biden Ukrainian Corruption Corporation, an organization Hell-bent on New World Order Russia regime change, fueled by the fleecing of the American taxpayer.
[00:48:09.513 --> 00:48:12.915]  In 2010, Jankowicz attended a university in Russia.
[00:48:13.255 --> 00:48:19.759]  In 2017, she was a Fulbright Fellow in Kiev, working alongside the Foreign Ministry of Ukraine.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:32.528]  She has also served as a disinformation fellow at the treasonous Woodrow Wilson Center, and as supervisor of the Russia and Belarus programs at the National Democratic Institute.
[00:48:32.808 --> 00:48:41.419]  Republicans are criticizing your decision, the administration's decision to choose Nina Jankowicz to lead this disinformation board.
[00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:43.882]  They say she is not somebody who is neutral.
[00:48:44.303 --> 00:48:44.863]  Your response?
[00:48:45.324 --> 00:48:46.425]  Eminently qualified.
[00:48:46.826 --> 00:48:49.890]  A renowned expert in the field of disinformation.
[00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:50.530]  And neutral?
[00:48:50.591 --> 00:48:51.311]  Absolutely so.
[00:48:52.381 --> 00:48:57.381]   is really quite ferocious. It's when a huckster takes their lies and makes them sound precocious
[00:48:57.381 --> 00:49:02.381]   by saying them in Congress or a mainstream outlet. So, disinformation's origins are slightly
[00:49:02.381 --> 00:49:03.381]  less atrocious.
[00:49:03.381 --> 00:49:10.381]   When the department picked her, was the department aware of her TikTok videos?
[00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:13.381]  Um, Senator, um, I was...
[00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:16.381]  They're really quite precocious.
[00:49:16.698 --> 00:49:22.180]  Senator, I was not aware of those videos.
[00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:30.182]  And as the multi-millionaire Wall Street leeching Democratic Party eggs on World War III and funnels in billions of U.S.
[00:49:30.242 --> 00:49:36.145]   taxpayer dollars to one of the most corrupt countries on Earth, No, don't do that.
[00:49:36.005 --> 00:49:41.365]   corruption blatantly tied to the Biden family, Jenkiewicz fronts an effort mirroring the
[00:49:41.365 --> 00:49:46.905]   totalitarianism being wielded on Ukrainian dissenters, an effort that would make the
[00:49:46.905 --> 00:49:51.385]  Ukrainian Goebbels-worshipping Azov battalion very proud.
[00:49:51.385 --> 00:49:54.985]  Ask yourself, what is the endgame for a ministry of truth?
[00:49:54.985 --> 00:49:55.985]  No, don't do that.
[00:49:55.985 --> 00:49:57.425]  Your door is being kicked in.
[00:49:57.425 --> 00:49:58.585]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:49:58.585 --> 00:50:18.345]   We are now into our number two on this live Monday, May 9th broadcast.
[00:50:19.225 --> 00:50:22.646]  And I'd cleared the decks with no guests today, because I want to take a lot of phone calls.
[00:50:23.226 --> 00:50:28.908]  But MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene, is able to pop in at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:50:28.928 --> 00:50:30.088]  She'll be with us for 30 minutes.
[00:50:30.128 --> 00:50:33.889]  But the next hour and a half, we're taking a ton of your phone calls.
[00:50:33.929 --> 00:50:34.909]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:50:34.729 --> 00:50:39.729]  877-789-2539. Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:50:39.729 --> 00:50:42.729]  We have the big Ukraine news.
[00:50:42.963 --> 00:50:46.486]  Vladimir Putin vows, as in 1945, victory will be ours.
[00:50:47.467 --> 00:50:48.528]  Jill Biden visits.
[00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.750]  So does Bono and other crooks.
[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:51.711]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:50:52.472 --> 00:50:56.215]  We've got huge COVID-19 lockdown 2 coming news.
[00:50:56.415 --> 00:50:57.156]  We don't stop it.
[00:50:57.917 --> 00:51:01.881]  We have got so much to break down on the new ministry of truth and more.
[00:51:03.854 --> 00:51:11.818]  We have millions of regular listeners, wonderful people, you know who you are, but we also have millions of people that just come through occasionally and listen to see what it's all about.
[00:51:13.278 --> 00:51:15.799]  And what it's all about is the rest of your life and the rest of my life.
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:25.584]  The globalists have decided to cut off the resources to the general public and to bring in a post-industrial world to then force depopulation.
[00:51:26.224 --> 00:51:27.024]  That's the stated goal.
[00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:39.073]   And I've got more quotes from the Davos Group and the UN, more video of them saying it, Yesterday and today while they meet in Switzerland to decide the future of humanity.
[00:51:41.875 --> 00:51:48.319]  And so this broadcast is really about getting people to become active in their futures.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.320]  And learning how the world really works.
[00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:59.245]  And learning who the real power players are so we don't get run over by these corporate fascists and their leftist minions.
[00:52:01.351 --> 00:52:16.879]  Speaking of Marjorie Taylor Greene, it was called a big win Friday afternoon when the judge said, after putting her through the ringer, that the Democrat Party lawsuit trying to block her from being able to run for office was unconstitutional.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.981]  She's not been charged with a crime.
[00:52:21.362 --> 00:52:22.302]  She's done nothing wrong.
[00:52:22.342 --> 00:52:24.664]  She won her last election in a landslide.
[00:52:24.684 --> 00:52:28.986]  She's an amazing lady of courage and intelligence who's gone through a lot.
[00:52:30.694 --> 00:52:39.002]  How can you bar somebody just because they wanted to challenge an election legally and lawfully, something Democrats do every time there's an election?
[00:52:39.363 --> 00:52:39.923]  How can you do that?
[00:52:39.983 --> 00:52:49.651]   So, how is it really a victory to say, oh, the judge said, That she can run for office.
[00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:53.374]  The judge shouldn't even have heard the case.
[00:52:54.135 --> 00:53:02.061]  All the other cases brought against more than a dozen members of Congress, like Gozer and others, the judges said it's unconstitutional.
[00:53:02.402 --> 00:53:06.045]  I'm not going to hear it on its face.
[00:53:09.788 --> 00:53:12.410]  If they were convicted felons, then you can say they can't run.
[00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:13.991]  And I think that's even unconstitutional.
[00:53:14.011 --> 00:53:17.671]   I think once you've done your time, you should be able to Run for office.
[00:53:18.631 --> 00:53:47.984]   But the idea of saying that conservatives and populists and Christians and nationalists, America firsters, that we are trying to steal elections when the Democrats are being constantly caught doing it, amazing evidence in the next decision to film 2,000 mules, while they're trying to block the public, From being able to have the candidates of their choice to run, the most fundamental assault on voting rights one could imagine.
[00:53:48.744 --> 00:53:50.025]  All right, we've got a lot of callers here.
[00:53:50.045 --> 00:53:51.066]  Start going to them right now.
[00:53:51.646 --> 00:53:53.307]  Adam in Oklahoma has a question.
[00:53:53.347 --> 00:53:55.388]  He says, who is Q?
[00:53:55.908 --> 00:53:57.249]  Would you like to elaborate on that?
[00:53:57.269 --> 00:53:58.590]  And then I'll tell you who Q is.
[00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:00.131]  Okay.
[00:54:00.271 --> 00:54:00.471]  Yeah.
[00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:01.131]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.612]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:54:03.052 --> 00:54:09.436]  A few years ago, you painted some broad brush strokes about who Q was and how possibly had exchanged hands and things like that.
[00:54:10.089 --> 00:54:15.350]  And at one point you threatened that if they didn't come out and say who they were themselves, that you were going to do it.
[00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:22.892]  And you know, I can't listen all the time, but maybe you did cover it at some point, but I never did hear names named about who Q is.
[00:54:24.532 --> 00:54:31.493]  Well, I'm on record saying that Q was lying, that Trump would be back in office on January 20th.
[00:54:33.534 --> 00:54:36.574]  Right, but do you have names of who Q is?
[00:54:36.614 --> 00:54:39.575]  Well, let's just, let me talk for a second, okay?
[00:54:43.871 --> 00:54:48.033]  Q is such a horrible thing that I hate to even talk about it.
[00:54:49.094 --> 00:54:49.394]  Alright?
[00:54:50.195 --> 00:54:51.756]  Q is anonymous.
[00:54:52.556 --> 00:54:55.798]  So it's when people are calling and asking me, who is the anonymous hacking group?
[00:54:56.138 --> 00:54:59.720]  It's any group that wants to call themselves anonymous.
[00:55:00.281 --> 00:55:04.903]  It's the same thing with Q. It's called esoterica, or occult.
[00:55:05.304 --> 00:55:06.384]  Occult means hidden.
[00:55:07.785 --> 00:55:17.721]   When you see the movie Eyes Wide Shut, based on real things that went on, When they go to the satanic orgy where the woman's killed, you don't know who anyone is.
[00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:18.901]  They're wearing masks.
[00:55:20.102 --> 00:55:24.223]  That's why historically people wearing masks generally aren't the good guys.
[00:55:25.743 --> 00:55:30.305]  And so it's a tar baby because people love a puzzle.
[00:55:30.345 --> 00:55:31.605]  They love a scavenger hunt.
[00:55:32.494 --> 00:55:37.713]   And they want to feel like they're part of something magic and secretly getting
[00:55:37.713 --> 00:55:41.574]   orders from president Trump and that everything was fine and everybody was
[00:55:41.574 --> 00:55:45.274]   going to get arrested and Trump was going to end up being emperor and everything
[00:55:45.274 --> 00:55:50.233]   was fine and it was all a delusion to make people think everything was okay.
[00:55:50.233 --> 00:55:52.094]  So the Democrats could steal the election.
[00:55:52.094 --> 00:55:54.574]  And yes, I do know what happened with Q.
[00:55:54.574 --> 00:55:56.494]  I do know who started it.
[00:55:56.955 --> 00:55:58.335]  I do know what happened with it.
[00:55:58.536 --> 00:56:00.997]  But no one wants the truth, so I won't tell you.
[00:56:01.097 --> 00:56:01.597]  How about that?
[00:56:01.617 --> 00:56:04.338]  I mean, what do you think it is?
[00:56:05.679 --> 00:56:07.479]  To tell you the truth, I don't know.
[00:56:07.559 --> 00:56:09.240]  I do think it's a psyop for sure.
[00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:15.463]  But it seems to me like it's just time to take the mask off this Cobra Commander.
[00:56:15.523 --> 00:56:19.545]  If there is names to name, that they create this boogeyman.
[00:56:19.625 --> 00:56:28.915]   And certainly if the government wanted to know who it was, they would Find out, you know, in days if they wanted to.
[00:56:29.175 --> 00:56:30.076]  They don't want to say it.
[00:56:30.436 --> 00:56:31.196]  Yeah.
[00:56:32.017 --> 00:56:34.739]  You know, I'm in a unique position to know things a lot of people don't know.
[00:56:35.399 --> 00:56:37.321]  And in many cases to protect the innocent.
[00:56:40.743 --> 00:56:45.766]  I'm not going to say who started it, but I can tell you they were only in control of it for about a month.
[00:56:47.127 --> 00:56:52.691]  And then it got taken away by a bunch of disinfo experts and operatives right out of the CIA.
[00:56:54.196 --> 00:56:55.117]  And that's a fact.
[00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:57.999]  And I've got a track record of being accurate about that.
[00:56:58.059 --> 00:57:08.308]  So, here's what happened with Q. We were very successful exposing the child kidnapping ring Satanism angle of the Democratic Party.
[00:57:08.989 --> 00:57:15.474]  WikiLeaks was very, very successful at releasing real information.
[00:57:17.896 --> 00:57:19.958]  Remember that in the run-up to the election 2016?
[00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:24.971]  Hey, someone on the inside was giving out accurate information.
[00:57:24.991 --> 00:57:26.151]  Okay, I'm going to start over.
[00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:26.891]  I'm going to start over.
[00:57:27.892 --> 00:57:31.312]  Because the whole Q thing, we could talk for hours about this, so this may take me a while to go over.
[00:57:31.332 --> 00:57:35.314]  I've got a little bit of a bug in my throat here, sorry.
[00:57:36.894 --> 00:57:38.474]  You know, here's the thing about the Q deal.
[00:57:39.375 --> 00:57:42.195]  I lay out exactly what's going on and nobody cares.
[00:57:42.295 --> 00:57:44.196]  Every caller I talk to, like you, and I'm not mad at you.
[00:57:46.516 --> 00:57:50.257]  When I sit here and I'm telling you specific stuff, I say, did you hear what I just said?
[00:57:50.777 --> 00:57:54.135]   And he responded back with, "I know somebody was giving out accurate information."
[00:57:54.135 --> 00:58:03.496]  Do you, I mean, I mean, look, I love you Adam.
[00:58:03.621 --> 00:58:06.722]  Did you hear what I just said in the lead up to that?
[00:58:06.862 --> 00:58:11.483]  What did I say to you right before you responded back with, yeah, I know somebody was giving out that information?
[00:58:13.007 --> 00:58:14.928]  Okay, I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.
[00:58:14.988 --> 00:58:17.688]  I might have... No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.
[00:58:17.728 --> 00:58:20.709]  You understand that we lost the cut free because of Q?
[00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:22.090]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:24.910]  And I have to put up with the Q people all over the place.
[00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:27.271]  And I'm tired of it!
[00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:30.432]  So I'm not mad at you, but you just, you hit a button here.
[00:58:30.912 --> 00:58:36.334]  And the damn Q people were the ones that manipulated some people to go into the damn Capitol and work with the feds.
[00:58:37.461 --> 00:58:40.262]  Q is the worst people on earth at the top.
[00:58:40.562 --> 00:58:41.822]  Q is the New World Order.
[00:58:42.103 --> 00:58:44.824]  Q is a psy-op to lead us around by our noses.
[00:58:45.864 --> 00:58:47.864]   I'm gonna put you on hold, I'm gonna come back to you, I'm gonna start over.
[00:58:47.864 --> 00:58:53.864]  I mean take the Q Shaman.
[00:58:54.027 --> 00:58:54.527]  I know him.
[00:58:54.547 --> 00:58:56.307]  I know filmmakers that know his family.
[00:58:56.828 --> 00:58:57.668]  He's not a bad guy.
[00:58:57.728 --> 00:58:59.148]  He's completely schizophrenic.
[00:58:59.869 --> 00:59:03.710]  They know he's schizophrenic and they're sending him to jail for four years for doing nothing.
[00:59:04.963 --> 00:59:07.586]  That's how sick and how painful all of this is.
[00:59:08.687 --> 00:59:14.052]  And my frustration, here's my frustration.
[00:59:18.336 --> 00:59:35.210]   I can give you the emails and the documents, and I've shown them on air probably 50 times, where Peter Daszak and Bill Gates and the rest of these criminals ...are openly creating COVID-19 and talking about releasing it, and no one cares, and no one listens, and no one knows about it.
[00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:41.632]  But if it's some magic, made-up, puff-the-magic-dragon-cue thing, everybody knows about it and wants to talk about the minutiae all day.
[00:59:41.652 --> 00:59:43.954]  So I'm going to start over, don't hang up, Adam, when we come back.
[00:59:45.094 --> 00:59:52.117]  We're showing some footage on screen of some of the pro-abortion activists protesting outside the Supreme Court Justice's homes.
[00:59:52.978 --> 00:59:57.860]  And there we've got their patron saint up there directing them.
[01:00:00.492 --> 01:00:01.452]  Alright, getting serious.
[01:00:01.752 --> 01:00:15.697]  Thank you so much for joining us here on the Alex Jones Show and I apologize to Adam from Oklahoma who asked a very reasonable question and I got angry because when I open my brain up and start going back over what all the Q stuff did, it gives me a headache.
[01:00:16.998 --> 01:00:20.899]  And the biggest frustration is I know exactly what went on every damn angle of it.
[01:00:21.159 --> 01:00:27.741]  It would take hours to explain and people don't seem to care about real hardcore documents.
[01:00:29.362 --> 01:00:33.747]   And so If you want to believe some nebulous thing, knock yourselves out.
[01:00:34.308 --> 01:00:38.708]  Some nebulous thing that led the country into destruction, and that lied to you at every turn.
[01:00:39.509 --> 01:00:41.769]  And I'm not talking to Adam, who I'll go back to in a moment.
[01:00:42.429 --> 01:00:44.089]  I'm talking to the nice people.
[01:00:44.729 --> 01:00:45.710]  A lot of good people.
[01:00:47.030 --> 01:01:00.736]   Like MTG, and General Flynn, and myself to a certain extent, knew what was going on with the Q thing, and knew that there was a tug of war going on over This anonymous thing.
[01:01:01.497 --> 01:01:08.924]  And so, well, let's just try to co-opt it away from the bad guys that are using it and use it for good.
[01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:10.445]  And that's what General Flynn tried to do.
[01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:10.886]  Okay?
[01:01:12.607 --> 01:01:13.748]  Had discussions with him about it.
[01:01:17.532 --> 01:01:25.499]  And I told Flynn he ought to just come out and say he's Q so he could shut up all the disinfo people and actually make Q good and it would be real if Flynn let it.
[01:01:28.134 --> 01:01:35.437]  And I'm not going to get into our off-the-record discussions, but because Q is so nebulous, Flynn wouldn't do that.
[01:01:36.177 --> 01:01:44.500]  So, I was working years ago, trying to fix Q. And I'm going to explain this to you, so I'm going to stop right here.
[01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:51.983]  I inspired Q. Paul Joseph Watson did.
[01:01:52.003 --> 01:01:52.983]  Infowars did.
[01:01:54.564 --> 01:01:56.665]  In the election, Wikileaks gave birth to Q.
[01:01:57.998 --> 01:01:58.958]  Well, Helix is real.
[01:01:59.479 --> 01:02:07.323]  The pedophilia, the child kidnapping rings that are in the emails with John Podesta and all the rest of it and Tony Podesta, that's all real.
[01:02:09.724 --> 01:02:11.525]  So how do you counter something like that?
[01:02:12.085 --> 01:02:19.169]  Well, they come out with saying it's really in a pizza place in D.C., not at farmhouses in New York and Illinois and California.
[01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:27.533]  So they divert off onto the pizza place that did have a bunch of creepy weird stuff and did have some of the people involved and stuff going there.
[01:02:31.932 --> 01:02:39.795]  And so you kill a real story with a fake story that discredits it.
[01:02:43.336 --> 01:02:44.356]  And that's what's happened there.
[01:02:46.137 --> 01:02:51.580]   And then a lot of patriots, some in the Trump administration, And summon U.S.
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:03:09.538]  intelligence, saw that Infowars got major heat for exposing the pedophile rings and Jeffrey Epstein, and they said, let's do it anonymously and put out intel from our people inside the White House when Trump first got elected.
[01:03:10.999 --> 01:03:22.968]   And let's really energize the grassroots and have like a secret Propaganda arm that tells the truth, but releases stuff too hot to handle to the public.
[01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:26.349]  And that was a consortium of people in the White House.
[01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:30.771]  They tried to do what InfoWars does, but not putting their name on it.
[01:03:33.132 --> 01:03:39.714]  Within a month, it got taken away on the 8chan and the 4chan boards by the other side.
[01:03:41.593 --> 01:03:44.395]  I came out and said, it's been compromised, it's bad, get away from it.
[01:03:44.775 --> 01:03:46.196]  Then a tug of war happened.
[01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:57.985]  Then big tech would let Q information be promoted and pushed to the top everywhere, knowing that would make people get involved with it and think it was real and popular, while we were all being suppressed.
[01:03:59.446 --> 01:04:02.908]  Then what if I warned people about the Q movement being anonymous and dangerous?
[01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:08.312]  People would think, oh, he's opposition to Q and Trump, he's bad.
[01:04:12.492 --> 01:04:26.405]  And then I explained that they were going to provocateur people, think they were part of secret missions for Trump, to do all sorts of weird violent things that happen in the U.S., but thank God none of it ever really got big until January 6th.
[01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:36.093]  And the majority of people that did go into the building of different organizations and groups and individuals had the Q propaganda background.
[01:04:37.268 --> 01:04:42.670]  That there was going to be this big storm, and this was the day of the takeover, and it was all going to happen that day.
[01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:52.613]  They were led and manipulated by the deep state that by then had taken over.
[01:04:52.693 --> 01:04:59.315]  And if you want to understand how this works, look up what happened in Russia in the 1920s.
[01:05:03.055 --> 01:05:21.316]  With movements that the Russian Intelligence Communist Agency set up to try to find out who all the opposition was in the country, they created their own underground group, which its slogan was trust the plan.
[01:05:25.427 --> 01:05:36.190]  And they actually went out and led the opposition for several years, and then tricked opposition into going to carry out violence, where they then caught them, imprisoned them, and executed them.
[01:05:38.711 --> 01:05:41.491]  And so, these programs have been done before.
[01:05:41.511 --> 01:05:46.933]  It was called Operation Trust.
[01:05:46.953 --> 01:05:49.753]  100-year-old PSYOP repackages QAnon.
[01:05:49.773 --> 01:05:51.674]  That's an excellent article on it.
[01:05:53.715 --> 01:05:58.556]  He went on to bear striking resemblance to Bolshevik PSYOP from 1920s, known as Operation Trust.
[01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:31.589]   And so, Operation Trust 2.0, everything The Globalist does is Bolshevik in style, was carried out, it's been carried out, and now it's gotten so insane, overhead shot please, that in Dallas, and in Vegas, and in New York City, and in LA, and in Austin, They have meetings sometimes with thousands, usually hundreds, of people that show up with flags saying Trump JFK Jr.
[01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:39.553]  2024, believing he's going to show up, and then they'll just pick some random insane person out of the crowd and say it's JFK Jr.
[01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:46.597]  For TV viewers, I'm showing you the image of what's probably 500,000 people in Dealey Plaza, downtown Dallas.
[01:06:48.447 --> 01:06:50.148]  Waiting for JFK Jr.
[01:06:50.168 --> 01:07:00.374]  to arrive, and that is all the PSYOPers, literally testing the mind control they've got over these people.
[01:07:00.394 --> 01:07:03.996]  And when these people admit they're wrong, they'll be free of this.
[01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:07.498]  But they can't admit they're wrong, because they're under Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:07:09.299 --> 01:07:11.300]  And those very people think I'm bad.
[01:07:12.537 --> 01:07:16.258]  Because I told them, January 20th, Biden will be sworn in.
[01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:28.120]  After January 6th, the big push was from the Q people was, oh my gosh, Trump is going to be put in that day.
[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.780]  Biden will be arrested.
[01:07:31.261 --> 01:07:32.861]  And I said, stay away from DC.
[01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:34.981]  Don't be part of any violence.
[01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:36.542]  Watch your back.
[01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.602]  This is not the time to demonstrate.
[01:07:41.636 --> 01:07:42.541]  This is the insanity.
[01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:47.594]  And so that's why I have a visceral response.
[01:07:47.614 --> 01:08:01.721]  I'm triggered like a leftist when I hear this or I see this because anything historically that's hidden and esoteric and wearing a mask that you're just supposed to trust as we all go, as one go, we all go and trust the plan.
[01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:03.682]  When you hear that, you shouldn't walk.
[01:08:03.762 --> 01:08:05.343]  You should run away from it.
[01:08:05.363 --> 01:08:07.324]  I'm going to come back, Adam, and finish up with you.
[01:08:07.364 --> 01:08:07.964]  Thank you so much.
[01:08:07.984 --> 01:08:10.946]  I apologize by blowing up nothing to do with you.
[01:08:10.966 --> 01:08:13.247]  So I'm actually glad that Adam called in and asked.
[01:08:14.332 --> 01:08:15.412]  Who and what is Q?
[01:08:16.653 --> 01:08:18.433]  And the answer is the same thing as anonymous.
[01:08:19.154 --> 01:08:25.596]  People have done good things as hackers, white hat activity, calling themselves anonymous and wearing the Guy Fawkes mask.
[01:08:25.996 --> 01:08:27.496]  A lot of bad stuff has been done on this thing.
[01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:38.360]  And so anything that is hidden and esoteric is a lot of fun for some people, but it's very, very dangerous and not good.
[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:41.641]  And that's basically where we are.
[01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:45.772]  On that issue, and I'm pretty much done talking about it.
[01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:56.217]  It's been crawling out from under its rock again, and people need to understand that it is simply going to try to lead the Liberty Movement astray.
[01:08:57.478 --> 01:09:00.339]  You had Trump up there saying what he believed in, and he was the president.
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:10.285]  You have Tucker Carlson, you have Alex Jones, you have yourself, you have countless others who have long histories, you know who they are, you know what they have to say, and what they're doing.
[01:09:11.195 --> 01:09:16.269]  And then you've got groups that tell you everything's wonderful, and everything's about to be fixed, and everything's fine.
[01:09:16.429 --> 01:09:17.071]  Now I'll tell you!
[01:09:18.877 --> 01:09:22.660]  Worldwide, the pendulum has been swinging back against globalism and tyranny for a while.
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:30.546]  That's why you're seeing the lockdowns and the surveillance and the wars and all the inflation is they're trying to distract us and get us back in our cages.
[01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:32.768]  So there is a lot of good things happening.
[01:09:32.788 --> 01:09:37.472]  That's because you've been spreading the word and you've been waking up and you've been waking other people up.
[01:09:38.153 --> 01:09:42.336]  Not some magical intelligence agency or group.
[01:09:44.678 --> 01:09:46.319]  And for me, it's not about name dropping.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.221]  And most of these meetings have been off record.
[01:09:49.622 --> 01:09:52.225]  But I haven't just met with people like General Flynn many times.
[01:09:54.067 --> 01:09:56.370]  I've met with other former intelligence agency heads.
[01:09:57.111 --> 01:10:00.235]  I've met with well-known, very famous billionaires.
[01:10:02.512 --> 01:10:05.355]  And at these meetings, they're not trying to flatter me.
[01:10:06.316 --> 01:10:08.759]  They're spending most of their time asking what I believe.
[01:10:09.479 --> 01:10:11.382]  And it isn't about, oh, Alex Jones knows it all.
[01:10:11.782 --> 01:10:14.605]  When they have meetings with smart people, they want to hear from them.
[01:10:15.186 --> 01:10:16.046]  And I want to hear from them.
[01:10:16.527 --> 01:10:20.651]  And our knowledge base is about on par with each other.
[01:10:21.332 --> 01:10:21.913]  It's about equal.
[01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:30.999]  And so, we've got the best thinking with the facts on what's going on, and it's completely transparent.
[01:10:31.259 --> 01:10:42.207]  I have a stack of new studies, one out of Israel, one out of the UK, with the same number of spike in emergency room heart problems among fully vaccinated young adults, 25% increase.
[01:10:44.289 --> 01:10:50.354]  I mean, that's real numbers, real studies, real things you can sink your teeth into and check.
[01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:55.595]  The corporate media almost never gives you any documentation.
[01:10:55.896 --> 01:10:58.421]  They just say Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[01:10:58.882 --> 01:11:02.008]  Or they just say Alex Jones ran January 6th.
[01:11:02.068 --> 01:11:04.633]  Or they just say this stuff with no proof.
[01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:06.592]  And you shouldn't walk.
[01:11:07.192 --> 01:11:09.194]  You should run from people like that.
[01:11:09.234 --> 01:11:10.194]  I want to get to all your calls.
[01:11:10.234 --> 01:11:10.775]  I apologize.
[01:11:10.815 --> 01:11:16.139]  I've spent 20 minutes on this, but it's an important topic, a painful topic.
[01:11:16.159 --> 01:11:17.600]  Got a lot of people hurt on January 6.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:23.144]  A lot of innocent folks are in jail because they thought that they were part of a secret plan working with Trump.
[01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:24.405]  And it wasn't Trump.
[01:11:24.485 --> 01:11:27.407]  It was the deep state manipulating Trump supporters.
[01:11:28.388 --> 01:11:30.169]  So they could demonize all of us together.
[01:11:30.689 --> 01:11:34.091]  And their plan basically fizzled as a dud, but still caused damage.
[01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:40.554]  And we're sad for all those, including the police officer that died of a heart attack later, and others, but particularly Ashley Babbitt and others that died.
[01:11:41.495 --> 01:11:41.875]  Okay.
[01:11:42.515 --> 01:11:43.676]  Adam in Oklahoma.
[01:11:43.756 --> 01:11:44.696]  Does that answer your question?
[01:11:45.536 --> 01:11:45.837]  Yes, sir.
[01:11:45.857 --> 01:11:48.638]  That was a very powerful answer, and God bless you, Alex.
[01:11:48.878 --> 01:11:51.519]  What you wrapped up there is the reason why I called and asked.
[01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:54.521]  It's just so many people took the bait for this, and it troubles me.
[01:11:55.456 --> 01:11:57.177]  And there's so many real things happening.
[01:11:57.717 --> 01:12:00.978]  That was the intent of my call, and I sure appreciate the answer you gave.
[01:12:01.018 --> 01:12:02.259]  Oh, listen, it had nothing to do with you.
[01:12:02.279 --> 01:12:03.119]  It was a great question.
[01:12:05.260 --> 01:12:06.240]  I'll just be honest with you.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:16.504]  I am very angry about January 6th, and I'm very angry how they stole the election, and I'm very angry how people bought into Q. I'm not angry with them.
[01:12:16.644 --> 01:12:18.625]  I just, it just enrages me.
[01:12:18.645 --> 01:12:21.386]  So I'm sorry that some of that rage sounded like it was directed at you.
[01:12:22.385 --> 01:12:26.767]  I know it's been a long conversation, but if you'd let me say a prayer for you, I'd sure appreciate it.
[01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:27.127]  Please do.
[01:12:28.547 --> 01:12:36.330]  Father God, thank you for some of the things that are coming to light in this world, and I thank you for the courage that Alex and his team have had.
[01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:47.635]  And Father, as these things come to the surface, let us all look in the mirror at our own sins, and let us see what Christ has done for us, and let us work on our own walk.
[01:12:50.014 --> 01:12:56.338]  We all have room for improvement, Father, but as some of these treacherous evils come to light, just let us look in the mirror as well.
[01:12:56.658 --> 01:12:58.299]  We just thank you and give you praise.
[01:12:58.339 --> 01:12:59.480]  In Jesus' name, amen.
[01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:00.220]  Amen.
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.161]  Thank you so much, Adam.
[01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:01.861]  Thank you so much.
[01:13:03.822 --> 01:13:04.703]  I'm so exhausted.
[01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:18.698]   I mean, the Bible says With great knowledge comes great sorrow, and it's really true.
[01:13:19.738 --> 01:13:38.849]  We could end this and fix this so quickly, but as Christ said, the people perish for lack of knowledge, and we are just already going into the new world order, and it's just gonna, it's gonna be so rough, and you know, I don't want to sit up here and tell you things are gonna get tough and demoralize you.
[01:13:38.889 --> 01:13:51.761]   At least you know ahead of other people, and you can warn them and get ready, but I wish I could sit up here and give you all roses and tell you everything's gonna be fine.
[01:13:53.081 --> 01:13:53.461]  It's not.
[01:13:55.541 --> 01:14:13.625]  And Winston Churchill, after the Battle of Dunkirk when the British forces have been smashed and pushed in the ocean by the Nazis, he can pull a speech up and he says, I cannot offer you peace, I can't offer you safety, I can't offer you anything but blood, sweat, and tears and a long, hard war.
[01:14:14.704 --> 01:14:16.385]  But I know this in the end, we will win.
[01:14:16.845 --> 01:14:20.848]  The outcome of fighting and defeating this tyranny will be much greater than living under it and submitting to it.
[01:14:21.608 --> 01:14:23.949]  And so we're going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[01:14:26.631 --> 01:14:27.591]  That's all I can offer you.
[01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:35.076]  I mean, I could get up here and have three times the listeners if I blew a bunch of smoke up your rear end, folks.
[01:14:36.917 --> 01:14:37.677]  I just can't do it.
[01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:38.738]  I just can't do it.
[01:14:39.478 --> 01:14:44.117]   And that doesn't mean that I'm not literally shaken by this information.
[01:14:44.117 --> 01:14:46.118]  [Sigh]
[01:14:46.118 --> 01:14:54.038]   You know, every day I get up and there's a new Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab or Harari quote
[01:14:54.038 --> 01:14:58.356]   where they're going to depopulate us and they're going to take everything we've got.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:01.302]  I got a new quote from him today about, yeah, you'll have no freedom.
[01:15:01.762 --> 01:15:02.743]  You'll have no privacy.
[01:15:02.803 --> 01:15:04.064]  You'll have no democracy.
[01:15:04.104 --> 01:15:05.725]  You'll have no privacy.
[01:15:05.905 --> 01:15:09.188]  I mean, they're just in our faces.
[01:15:09.648 --> 01:15:11.690]  And I think we're better than these people.
[01:15:12.614 --> 01:15:13.634]  At least as good as them.
[01:15:13.994 --> 01:15:22.116]  Why do we let trash like this sit up there and declare war on us and instead everybody still wants to talk about JFK Jr.
[01:15:22.176 --> 01:15:26.217]  is still alive and he's gonna show up with Trump and they're gonna run for president.
[01:15:26.257 --> 01:15:29.578]  That's just the most insane horse crap ever heard!
[01:15:32.779 --> 01:15:37.840]  But they do it to punch your buttons and see what they can get you to do.
[01:15:40.984 --> 01:15:50.309]  And let me say this about my beloved populist Christian right-wing, who's the smartest, most informed, hard-working people on the face of the planet, and who I'm humbled to know.
[01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:57.894]  The delusional behavior in the Patriot movement is one-one-hundredth out of the Democrats.
[01:15:58.294 --> 01:16:02.957]  The Democrats think a man can become a woman, and a woman can become a man.
[01:16:03.757 --> 01:16:09.020]  They think chopping a little boy's genitals off or a little girl's breast off is a plus.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.481]  They think pedophilia is good.
[01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:11.661]  They think inflation is good.
[01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:13.763]  They think open borders and disease is good.
[01:16:13.803 --> 01:16:14.923]  They think fentanyl is good.
[01:16:15.463 --> 01:16:17.385]  They think the evaluation of currencies is good.
[01:16:18.545 --> 01:16:22.407]  They think famine and death and destruction and everything is good.
[01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:23.868]  And you look at them, they're jokes.
[01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:26.389]  And they're very sad.
[01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:32.433]  And so when we see delusion, we have to understand that that is our enemy.
[01:16:35.956 --> 01:16:40.560]  So if something is too good to be true, it is too good to be true.
[01:16:41.121 --> 01:16:44.083]  And there ain't no free lunches in this universe.
[01:16:44.123 --> 01:16:46.885]  Now, I'm going to go to the calls and I'm going to take five calls next segment.
[01:16:46.906 --> 01:16:52.891]  I'm going to get to every caller on the board ahead of MTG joining us in about 45, 50 minutes from now.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:58.066]  So we'll go to the order the calls are received when we come back.
[01:16:58.186 --> 01:16:58.847]  So get ready.
[01:16:59.388 --> 01:17:00.550]  And I appreciate you all holding.
[01:17:01.031 --> 01:17:02.854]  That Q discussion was important.
[01:17:03.515 --> 01:17:06.800]  Very briefly, I misspoke at the end of the last hour and it's a good mistake I made.
[01:17:07.702 --> 01:17:09.423]  Ultra 12 sold out for four or five months.
[01:17:09.483 --> 01:17:10.423]  Highest quality vitamin B12.
[01:17:10.483 --> 01:17:11.383]  So good for your body.
[01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:12.963]  Taking sublingually under the tongue.
[01:17:13.084 --> 01:17:14.184]  Ultra 12 is back in stock.
[01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.525]  At 40% off, not 25% off.
[01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:19.785]  40% off for a limited time.
[01:17:20.366 --> 01:17:23.046]  Infowarsstore.com, you can get it 40% off as well.
[01:17:23.466 --> 01:17:25.887]  With Survival Shield X2, despite the fact it's selling out.
[01:17:26.547 --> 01:17:30.528]  Together in the combo pack, the Infowars LifeCore combo pack.
[01:17:30.908 --> 01:17:32.209]  40% off as well with those together.
[01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:33.109]  And it keeps us on the air.
[01:17:33.369 --> 01:17:34.309]  And they're game changing.
[01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:35.390]  We'll be right back.
[01:17:35.410 --> 01:17:36.070]  Please stay with us.
[01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:43.014]  We're about to go to your calls, Julio and others, in the order they received here on the Alejandro Jones Show.
[01:17:45.236 --> 01:17:46.156]  Look at this headline.
[01:17:47.077 --> 01:17:47.898]  Monday Live.
[01:17:48.958 --> 01:17:57.025]  Leptis Brown shirts intensify firebombings, intimidation campaigns across the U.S., an attempt to force Americans into letting them kill more children.
[01:17:57.045 --> 01:17:58.166]  And it's all true.
[01:17:59.605 --> 01:18:00.766]  That's some other big breaking news.
[01:18:00.806 --> 01:18:07.169]  I'll hit at the end of the segment dealing with George Soros and his mind control board, his Ministry of Truth.
[01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.929]  Can't make that up.
[01:18:07.989 --> 01:18:09.150]  It's all real, all happening.
[01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:11.911]  It's going to get a lot worse till we wake up and say no.
[01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.713]  But let's talk to a great caller in Colorado.
[01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:15.813]  Let's talk to Julio.
[01:18:18.975 --> 01:18:21.456]  Andro, it's good to chat with you, senor.
[01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.316]  It's been a while.
[01:18:22.496 --> 01:18:32.907]   I escaped Illinois, the Chicago area, a city that was once a crown jewel of the Midwest and the U.S., escaped to
[01:18:32.907 --> 01:18:37.677]   Northern Colorado where there are a lot of patriots. I see a lot of InfoWars bumper stickers, a lot of
[01:18:37.677 --> 01:18:43.208]   beautiful people out there, but I tell you what, Alex, I've never seen a homeless problem like I've
[01:18:43.208 --> 01:18:50.217]   seen in Denver, Colorado. I call it Mount Skid, like Skid Row in L.A. It's incredible, folks.
[01:18:50.328 --> 01:18:58.634]  If you're in a city, if you're near a metropolitan area, I'd say escape while you can because it's going to be horrific in the years to come.
[01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:02.617]  And for those that don't know, I didn't know you were the Julio I knew.
[01:19:02.957 --> 01:19:04.358]  You've been a guest on the show a few times.
[01:19:04.378 --> 01:19:07.501]  You're a reporter, so good to have you here with us, Julio.
[01:19:08.567 --> 01:19:09.848]  Yeah, good to be back, Alex.
[01:19:09.928 --> 01:19:12.350]  It's been a while since I've last spoken to you.
[01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:21.957]  It's incredible to see where we are in this country from, I mean, God, I started listening to you when I was in college, oh, 10, 11 years ago.
[01:19:23.479 --> 01:19:24.480]  It's insane.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.144]  You know, when I first started calling, I spoke a lot about weather modification.
[01:19:28.204 --> 01:19:32.828]  The Air Force has a document on weather as a force multiplier, owning the weather in 2025.
[01:19:32.928 --> 01:19:46.261]  Well, it's a part of a six-piece document series called Air Force 2025, where they go through a bunch of scenarios that they forecast for the year 2025, and here we are a few years out.
[01:19:46.921 --> 01:20:01.987]  And it's quite insane to see, especially in this document, talking about transnational corporations and their power and influence over policy, over wars, and we're seeing that right now, especially with a guy like Bill Gates.
[01:20:02.628 --> 01:20:11.531]  My biggest concern, Alex, you see with the situation in Ukraine and Russia with fertilizer and wheat prices skyrocketing, you're also going to see that with hay.
[01:20:11.831 --> 01:20:24.720]   I spoke to a hay farmer out in northeastern Colorado who's No, no doubt about it.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.040]  I mean, if you look at the U.S.
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:33.343]  drought monitor, the biggest areas in the country that's dealing with drought is the western part of the United States.
[01:20:33.403 --> 01:20:37.405]  That's California where it produces a lot of fruits and vegetables, wine.
[01:20:38.138 --> 01:20:46.921]  Colorado, you have the High Plains as well, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming with a lot of weed that is dependent across the country.
[01:20:47.461 --> 01:20:52.482]  So, I've attended several weather modification conferences over the last few years.
[01:20:52.742 --> 01:20:55.263]  One in San Antonio, Texas, beautiful city.
[01:20:55.363 --> 01:20:56.583]  One in Fargo, North Dakota.
[01:20:56.924 --> 01:21:01.865]  So, there's no doubt in my mind that weather modification programs are taking place.
[01:21:02.549 --> 01:21:07.233]  If people just search geoengineering, they'll read people like Alan Roback from Rutgers.
[01:21:07.353 --> 01:21:08.154]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:21:08.274 --> 01:21:09.695]  And it all ties together.
[01:21:09.715 --> 01:21:13.318]  And it's all part of the depopulation plan.
[01:21:13.738 --> 01:21:14.839]  They really admit they're doing it.
[01:21:14.859 --> 01:21:15.980]  Julio, thank you for holding.
[01:21:16.020 --> 01:21:16.841]  It's great hearing from you.
[01:21:17.642 --> 01:21:25.748]  If you ever want to shoot us an email or come on as a guest or tell us what you're doing these days, maybe you can do some reporting for us while you're out in Colorado.
[01:21:25.888 --> 01:21:27.049]  And let me take this.
[01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.991]  Get his number, guys.
[01:21:29.171 --> 01:21:29.391]  Thanks.
[01:21:29.431 --> 01:21:29.831]  Thanks, Julio.
[01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:32.078]  Take this full circle.
[01:21:32.398 --> 01:21:34.019]  The left is farming homeless.
[01:21:34.059 --> 01:21:34.979]  They advertise it.
[01:21:35.079 --> 01:21:35.840]  They bring them there.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.040]  They give them food.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.342]  And then they get welfare checks that the leftist groups skim the top off of.
[01:21:42.902 --> 01:21:50.485]  And so they're farming the homeless like a farmer would farm wheat or corn or soybeans.
[01:21:51.305 --> 01:21:51.665]  All right.
[01:21:51.805 --> 01:21:55.427]  Up next here would be Eben in California.
[01:21:55.507 --> 01:21:56.407]  Eben, thank you for calling.
[01:21:57.947 --> 01:21:59.428]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you today.
[01:21:59.986 --> 01:22:08.108]  Hey Alex, I wanted to point something out, but I think the key to victory is the Church and Jesus Christ and all the people in America that are Christians.
[01:22:08.729 --> 01:22:14.210]  And if I could point something out, I noticed that in churches and studies they say that they stop preaching prophecy.
[01:22:14.230 --> 01:22:19.752]  25% of the Bible is prophecy, and it essentially is talking about what you're talking about.
[01:22:20.432 --> 01:22:45.063]   So the great disconnect and where the power has been removed, almost like a Q-Movement thing, where the power has been removed from America is with weak pastors That got bribed into not preaching prophecy, and then we have pastors that will preach the rapture, which I actually believe in at some point, but that Christians think, hey, if I just, you know, go to sleep and rest, that everything will be done right.
[01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:55.646]  Well, I believe the reason why God's allowed so many people to suffer with the vaccine and things like that is so that they'll realize God is trying to do us a favor, telling us about prophecy.
[01:22:55.906 --> 01:23:09.570]   He's trying to get us ready, and the listeners The greatest fault of the earth are the InfoWars listeners, and I just want to point out, because I've been able to do it effectively in California with just one guy, building a couple little websites and stuff like that.
[01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:32.578]   If every listener confronted the pastors in their town and said, you've got to deal with this, let me know what you think about InfoWars, tell me about this message, if it actually would cost a pastor his success in a town, He forced pastors to deal with InfoWars.com and the prophetic message that essentially you're preaching.
[01:23:32.998 --> 01:23:39.122]  And I do believe that InfoWars is the most effective church on planet Earth for getting the Word of God out.
[01:23:39.322 --> 01:23:41.283]  It's the one that isn't holding back.
[01:23:41.943 --> 01:23:43.364]  You don't have ulterior motives.
[01:23:43.664 --> 01:23:46.065]  From the products you sell, I really enjoyed X2.
[01:23:47.066 --> 01:23:50.187]  From the products you sell and everything you're saying, you're risking your life.
[01:23:50.687 --> 01:23:53.529]  And frankly, most Christian pastors aren't.
[01:23:54.051 --> 01:23:55.072]  They should be banned.
[01:23:55.733 --> 01:23:57.054]  They should be banned, not you.
[01:23:57.474 --> 01:24:01.398]  It's the pastors that are supposed to be talking about the New World Order, not you.
[01:24:01.418 --> 01:24:17.997]   So, you know, essentially, I believe you and Owen, the whole InfoWars team, are the most effective church on planet Earth, and I really would like to urge People that were given to their weak neighborly church to confront that church and to start making their tithes and offerings to InfoWars.
[01:24:18.397 --> 01:24:19.698]  And just so you know, I'm an evangelist.
[01:24:19.778 --> 01:24:23.200]  I have a jesuschristworldwideministries.org website.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.661]  It's abortion, murder, I'm doing what I can.
[01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:34.926]  But I'll tell you this, the most effective ministry tool I've ever had for people to come into Christ was explaining to them about InfoWars and learn about the real world.
[01:24:35.427 --> 01:24:39.529]  Now they have the fear of God in them, which should have been there the entire time.
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:41.201]  Beautifully said.
[01:24:41.221 --> 01:24:42.822]  The churches have been taken over.
[01:24:42.862 --> 01:24:44.303]  They're not doing their jobs on average.
[01:24:44.763 --> 01:24:48.065]  And the churches should be exploding in size right now as prophecies fulfilled.
[01:24:48.446 --> 01:24:50.547]  The church should be on the front lines fighting all this evil.
[01:24:50.907 --> 01:24:53.249]  But instead it's become really the heart of the New World Order.
[01:24:53.509 --> 01:24:57.832]  And that's why it goes back to the people on the ground like you and I. And God bless you sir and I appreciate your call.
[01:24:59.553 --> 01:25:00.133]  Powerful call.
[01:25:00.153 --> 01:25:01.995]  Let's take another powerful call here.
[01:25:03.476 --> 01:25:05.058]  Hi Alex, it's a great pleasure to talk to you.
[01:25:04.878 --> 01:25:07.678]  He's a long-time caller. I want to hear what he has to say.
[01:25:07.678 --> 01:25:08.558]  I wonder what everybody has to say.
[01:25:08.558 --> 01:25:15.028]   But we're going to order the calls are received here. Let's go to Justin in North Carolina. You're on the air. Thank
[01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:15.518]  you, Justin.
[01:25:15.518 --> 01:25:20.878]   Hi Alex, it's a great pleasure to talk to you. I've been a listener for
[01:25:20.878 --> 01:25:23.518]  gosh, 15 years now.
[01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:29.768]   And I'm happy to say I've been able to pump money into the Infowars war chest for much of that
[01:25:29.768 --> 01:25:30.158]  time.
[01:25:30.299 --> 01:25:32.140]  We would have been shut down without you, brother.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.161]  We've been taking the Globalist on, especially the last four years at point-blank range.
[01:25:36.181 --> 01:25:37.422]  So thanks for keeping us in the fight.
[01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:39.563]  Oh, gosh, I know.
[01:25:39.583 --> 01:25:40.984]  I've been listening to you.
[01:25:41.044 --> 01:25:44.786]  Terror Storm was a new, your latest documentary when I started listening.
[01:25:44.826 --> 01:25:45.586]  It's been that long.
[01:25:45.646 --> 01:25:48.507]  So your studio is like a little broom closet.
[01:25:48.547 --> 01:25:49.128]  It was tiny.
[01:25:49.768 --> 01:25:52.908]   It's amazing to see what's happened in the last 15 years.
[01:25:53.208 --> 01:25:54.529]  But I mean, that's not why I'm calling in.
[01:25:54.929 --> 01:26:01.952]  I'm calling in, it kind of goes on from the last caller really, just about, you know, Christianity and following Jesus.
[01:26:02.133 --> 01:26:08.715]  I used to kind of almost scoff when I hear you talk about God on the show, way back when.
[01:26:08.836 --> 01:26:13.258]  I grew up in the Church of England, and I live in the U.S.
[01:26:13.318 --> 01:26:24.669]   now, but I grew up in England, and it was very easy to become cold because it just There was no talk of a real relationship between God and Jesus.
[01:26:24.749 --> 01:26:25.770]  It just, it wasn't really.
[01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:29.793]  It was, you kind of read a few Bible passages and it was very dry and very dull.
[01:26:31.013 --> 01:26:32.694]  And so I strayed for many years.
[01:26:34.536 --> 01:26:46.703]  But it wasn't until I was locked down in Spain in 2020 that I heard Pastor Rodney on your show, who was on your show last week, you know, and it was a fantastic interview.
[01:26:48.414 --> 01:26:49.335]  And I felt called.
[01:26:49.555 --> 01:26:51.136]  I just felt called to his church.
[01:26:51.356 --> 01:26:56.239]  It was quite profound, really, because I'd lived in Tampa for seven years.
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.941]  I was in... Justin, don't hang up.
[01:26:59.001 --> 01:26:59.882]  I want to hear the rest of this.
[01:26:59.922 --> 01:27:00.842]  We're going to break two minutes.
[01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:01.303]  Don't hang up.
[01:27:01.323 --> 01:27:02.283]  We're coming right back to you, Justin.
[01:27:02.303 --> 01:27:04.845]  And then we'll get to everybody else here.
[01:27:05.185 --> 01:27:10.549]  Carlos Marcos, Trucker Josh, Commie Fornia, Rodney, Michael, and Monica.
[01:27:11.448 --> 01:27:12.369]  Those are the order they receive.
[01:27:12.389 --> 01:27:14.069]  Well, Monica's actually before some of those, so we'll go.
[01:27:14.690 --> 01:27:15.951]  Monica's like the third caller we're going to.
[01:27:15.991 --> 01:27:21.053]  But we're going to come back with Justin, and then we're going to go to Carlos, Monica, and others.

[01:28:09.944 --> 01:28:11.965]  And that's why iodine deficiency is such a huge issue.
[01:28:12.366 --> 01:28:16.949]  We have the purest, cleanest, best iodine in the world from deep-earth crystals more than 7,000 feet deep.

[01:28:49.958 --> 01:28:55.479]  There is a spiritual war going on.
[01:28:55.479 --> 01:28:58.920]   And the only thing that makes sense when you look at what the New World Order is doing
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:04.838]   is that they're carrying out Satan's operation, which was predicted more than 2,000 years
[01:29:04.838 --> 01:29:05.838]  ago.
[01:29:05.862 --> 01:29:11.866]  And regardless whether Jesus and God is real, the blueprint of Christianity is proven historically to stop this evil.
[01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:16.550]  And the globalists are targeting it because they know it's the answer, because of course it's real.
[01:29:17.831 --> 01:29:25.376]  But there are going to be countless opportunists and devils that are going to try to put themselves in between you and God.
[01:29:27.157 --> 01:29:30.240]  There's a lot of great pastors, I'm not saying they're bad, but there are some that try to mislead.
[01:29:32.008 --> 01:29:34.530]  That's why Jesus said you need a personal relationship with God.
[01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:37.111]  That's what Christ and the New Testament was all about.
[01:29:37.191 --> 01:29:41.174]  But getting back to Justin, start over a little bit.
[01:29:41.194 --> 01:29:48.098]  You were saying it wasn't until you were in lockdown in Spain listening to Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on the show that something happened.
[01:29:48.118 --> 01:29:48.698]  Please continue.
[01:29:50.259 --> 01:29:52.701]  Well, Alex, yeah, it was it was your show.
[01:29:52.721 --> 01:29:54.442]  I was listening to the podcast.
[01:29:54.482 --> 01:30:05.344]   I mean, like I said earlier, I've been listening nearly daily for 15 years and Something in what he was saying, it just reached into my soul and touched something.
[01:30:05.364 --> 01:30:15.167]  And I just felt, I said to myself, I remember saying to myself, if this guy's church was in Tampa, as soon as I get home to Tampa, I would be there every day.
[01:30:15.307 --> 01:30:20.869]  And I didn't even know his church was in Tampa until the end of the broadcast where he announced where the River Church was.
[01:30:22.349 --> 01:30:38.706]   And as soon as I got back to Florida in December 2020, After the holidays were done, it was the first Sunday of 2021, and it was a Sunday morning, and I sat upright in bed, wide awake, like, I've got to go to the river.
[01:30:39.366 --> 01:30:42.027]  It was something truly profound.
[01:30:42.568 --> 01:30:44.329]  And I went to the church that day.
[01:30:44.389 --> 01:30:48.330]  I had never watched a service or anything like that online.
[01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:50.852]  I kind of even forgot about it until I was at that moment.
[01:30:50.912 --> 01:30:52.512]  It was kind of weird.
[01:30:53.253 --> 01:30:54.273]  And I got touched.
[01:30:54.553 --> 01:30:56.034]  I hadn't even got out of my car.
[01:30:56.998 --> 01:31:00.179]  And it was like a medicine ball hit me in my chest.
[01:31:00.419 --> 01:31:02.260]  I was like pushed back into the car seat.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:07.842]  I was like, wow, this is, this is the power of God stuff that people have been, I've been hearing about.
[01:31:08.622 --> 01:31:09.963]  Oh yeah, that's the Spirit.
[01:31:10.363 --> 01:31:10.803]  Powerful.
[01:31:11.864 --> 01:31:12.544]  Absolutely.
[01:31:13.044 --> 01:31:28.926]   And I tell you what, and I guess the reason for me telling this story is to just say to people that once you submit to God and the Holy Spirit and give your life to Jesus, Things will just start happening in your life.
[01:31:29.526 --> 01:31:34.250]  And I always used to, you know, God's talking to me my whole life, I didn't even realize it.
[01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:38.814]  You know, you think of it, I used to think of it as my gut, you know, that gut feeling.
[01:31:39.414 --> 01:31:42.857]  And every time I ignored my gut, you know, it was the wrong thing to do.
[01:31:44.859 --> 01:31:54.560]   And ever since I started going to Pastor Rodney's church, the river at Tampa Bay, the Listening and obeying, that's the most important thing.
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.562]  You have to be obedient to that voice.
[01:31:57.102 --> 01:32:10.978]   And as soon as you just obediently follow that voice and trust that it's good and it's got your best interests at heart, and the best interests of the world at heart, Things just start unlocking.
[01:32:11.038 --> 01:32:12.479]  Doors start opening.
[01:32:12.979 --> 01:32:18.463]  You have profound experiences just like I've had, and it's been the most incredible year.
[01:32:18.563 --> 01:32:31.371]  But the beautiful symbiotic thing about this is that the increases I've seen in my own life, you know, I make more money now than I've ever made in my life before, and it's been truly incredible.
[01:32:31.431 --> 01:32:36.574]  But the brilliant thing about that is, you know, I don't live some ostentatious lifestyle.
[01:32:36.894 --> 01:32:40.494]   All that increase enables me to give more money into the info.
[01:32:40.494 --> 01:32:42.974]  It enables me to tithe more money into my church.
[01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:45.134]  It enables me to help other people in the community.
[01:32:45.134 --> 01:32:49.134]  And I get so much joy from being able to do that.
[01:32:49.134 --> 01:32:50.413]  And it all comes down.
[01:32:50.413 --> 01:32:51.454]  And that's what's beautiful.
[01:32:51.454 --> 01:32:53.534]  And the more you do it, the more you're given.
[01:32:53.534 --> 01:32:54.894]  That is exactly how it works.
[01:32:54.894 --> 01:32:59.453]   And that's why Christian nations, even though they aren't purely Christian, but they try,
[01:32:59.453 --> 01:33:01.534]   they are the ones that have all the prosperity and all the power.
[01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:05.293]   And everyone wants to come there is because where there is Christ, there is prosperity.
[01:33:05.517 --> 01:33:08.618]  Where there is the devil, there is collapse and evil and pain.
[01:33:09.099 --> 01:33:09.879]  Very powerful.
[01:33:10.359 --> 01:33:11.460]  Justin, thank you for calling.
[01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:13.981]  Powerful call.
[01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:14.561]  God bless you.
[01:33:14.581 --> 01:33:15.842]  All right.
[01:33:17.162 --> 01:33:20.724]  Monica, and then Carlos, and then Marcos.
[01:33:21.798 --> 01:33:23.760]  And then California and others.
[01:33:25.321 --> 01:33:27.503]  Rodney, we're going to see everybody straight ahead.
[01:33:28.684 --> 01:33:29.084]  Stand by.
[01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:29.844]  And I got to go quick now.
[01:33:29.864 --> 01:33:30.585]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:33:30.965 --> 01:33:31.486]  Please stay with us.
[01:33:32.614 --> 01:33:52.570]  Well we took some truly amazing phone calls in the last hour and that's why a lot of times I say first-time callers and we're on a topic so we can stay on the topic other times wide open phones anywhere you want to go and I love the wild card effect of it and we're going back to your calls right now Monica thank you for holding from North Carolina you're on the air go ahead.
[01:33:52.590 --> 01:34:08.085]   Hi Alex it's good to talk to you today I'm calling from North Carolina I was the first A protester who was protesting against Governor shutdown to be arrested nationwide.
[01:34:08.605 --> 01:34:08.826]  Wow.
[01:34:09.206 --> 01:34:21.073]  So my attorney sent a letter to Governor Cooper here in North Carolina asking, did we not have the right to protest?
[01:34:21.953 --> 01:34:27.917]  And for folks that don't know, because we can probably look it up, there's probably a news article about it, Monica, tell us where you were protesting, what happened?
[01:34:29.571 --> 01:34:34.313]  So I was protesting in a public parking lot near Governor Cooper's mansion.
[01:34:34.413 --> 01:34:37.114]  It was an extremely peaceful protest.
[01:34:38.154 --> 01:34:42.456]  We were, most of us, in my corner of the parking lot anyway.
[01:34:42.496 --> 01:34:44.717]  We were in or near our cars.
[01:34:44.737 --> 01:34:46.937]  We were staying six feet apart from each other.
[01:34:46.977 --> 01:34:50.659]  We were just playing patriotic music, introducing ourselves.
[01:34:54.873 --> 01:35:06.161]  After my arrest, the police, and it's still there on their Twitter feed and on their Facebook page, are now through the wall, basically, that protesting was a non-essential activity.
[01:35:06.877 --> 01:35:10.359]  Yeah, that's something they did to conservatives, not just here, but around the world.
[01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:15.603]  If you were Black Lives Matter or a communist group, you could protest in France or England or the U.S.
[01:35:16.203 --> 01:35:24.709]  But if you were a Christian or a conservative protesting, well then, in some jurisdictions, the police would even tackle people and brutalize them and take them to jail.
[01:35:24.789 --> 01:35:26.490]  So, that's what happened to you, huh?
[01:35:28.391 --> 01:35:30.252]  I went peacefully.
[01:35:31.493 --> 01:35:35.055]  And I actually informed some of the news that I've told.
[01:35:36.357 --> 01:35:43.559]  One of my statements as I was taken away was that the police were just doing their job and I was just doing mine.
[01:35:44.059 --> 01:35:51.822]  And I honestly felt at the time that once it got... When you're arrested, it's no longer your fight with the police.
[01:35:52.062 --> 01:35:53.502]  It's now a fight with the court.
[01:35:53.822 --> 01:35:54.722]  Well, let me expand on this.
[01:35:54.782 --> 01:36:00.184]  I found a WXII report saying people arrested for protesting the lockdown.
[01:36:00.204 --> 01:36:01.064]  Wow.
[01:36:01.284 --> 01:36:03.585]  Is that the demonstration you were talking about?
[01:36:05.004 --> 01:36:06.705]  Um, later on there were more.
[01:36:06.725 --> 01:36:11.987]  So mine was the first nationwide and I was the only one that stayed in the parking lot.
[01:36:12.047 --> 01:36:13.708]  Ah, so you were the tip of the spear.
[01:36:13.788 --> 01:36:15.969]  Well, thank God you helped reopen the country.
[01:36:16.009 --> 01:36:16.570]  We salute you.
[01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:17.970]  Thank you.
[01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:29.596]  So, um, my attorney did receive a letter back from Governor Cooper stating, of course, what we already knew, which is my constitution overrides your governor's order.
[01:36:30.236 --> 01:36:34.018]  But I was found guilty in court about a year ago.
[01:36:34.659 --> 01:36:43.166]  For defying the governor's order and for trespassing on public property where I pay taxes.
[01:36:43.667 --> 01:36:49.492]  And it's in appeals court right now, so I'm calling in because I want to remind people of a few things.
[01:36:50.432 --> 01:36:55.877]  One is they're intimidating us and they're feeding us by fire hose right now.
[01:36:55.937 --> 01:36:59.200]  And simultaneously, they're isolating us from each other.
[01:36:59.795 --> 01:37:00.175]  Thank you Alex.
[01:36:59.994 --> 01:37:03.515]  censoring news stories, but we don't know about each other.
[01:37:03.515 --> 01:37:04.354]  Well, that's right.
[01:37:04.354 --> 01:37:06.154]  That's why it's important you call into the show.
[01:37:06.154 --> 01:37:08.074]  Now we know about what happened to you.
[01:37:08.074 --> 01:37:09.715]  God bless you and thank you.
[01:37:09.715 --> 01:37:11.074]  Wow, what a wonderful lady.
[01:37:11.074 --> 01:37:14.154]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Carlos in Canada.
[01:37:14.154 --> 01:37:16.074]  Carlos, welcome, sir.
[01:37:16.074 --> 01:37:17.114]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:37:17.114 --> 01:37:24.354]   Basically, what I wanted to mention to you is that the effort to have a world government
[01:37:24.354 --> 01:37:26.755]  has taken place before.
[01:37:26.755 --> 01:37:34.555]   It's not the first time that the same players that are behind the moves now were in the 1920s.
[01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:39.062]  Actually, in January 1920, they proposed the League of Nations.
[01:37:39.102 --> 01:37:40.222]  Sure, it was the very same people.
[01:37:40.242 --> 01:37:41.663]  It was the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:43.143]  Absolutely.
[01:37:43.303 --> 01:37:52.086]  And whenever I sort of like wonder, oh gee, you know, I'm losing my focus on history, I read one quote and it brings me right back.
[01:37:52.786 --> 01:37:55.827]  And it's a quote from Mayor Amschel Rothschild.
[01:37:57.257 --> 01:37:59.919]  1773, as you know, was an important day for me.
[01:38:00.419 --> 01:38:07.124]  But it says here, let me issue and control a nation's money, and I care not who writes the law.
[01:38:07.924 --> 01:38:12.087]  Now, when I read that, it puts me right back where it belongs.
[01:38:12.147 --> 01:38:15.810]  Because you see, the supply lines to the globalists is money.
[01:38:16.591 --> 01:38:26.121]   And Canadians and Americans pay taxes, and we're paying Through our taxes for these people to go ahead and bring about world government.
[01:38:26.521 --> 01:38:41.367]  Now, when the League of Nations was proposed to the American people, when they had a government that they could rely on, was not going to be a government to kill them or destroy them or to steal their future, this government rejected the League of Nations.
[01:38:42.888 --> 01:38:50.611]  I can't believe that there are 50 governors in the States that will approve having the sovereignty of the United States.
[01:38:51.323 --> 01:38:58.145]  In the health of the individual surrendered to some global organization that's going to be run by people like Bill Gates.
[01:38:58.865 --> 01:38:59.846]  I just can't.
[01:39:00.086 --> 01:39:00.586]  That's right.
[01:39:00.646 --> 01:39:02.366]  I mean, it's barely on Fox News.
[01:39:02.426 --> 01:39:07.068]  It's almost no coverage other than independent shows like this one, which is super frustrating, folks.
[01:39:07.148 --> 01:39:07.948]  I wish it was everywhere.
[01:39:07.968 --> 01:39:09.789]  It's like, hey, we're the only ones covering it.
[01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.929]  The U.N.
[01:39:11.129 --> 01:39:18.971]  openly has announced with Bill Gates that the World Economic Forum will be in control of everybody's health care with the U.N.
[01:39:19.331 --> 01:39:28.797]   and they're going to be meeting the Alex, may I make a comment?
[01:39:29.037 --> 01:39:32.159]  A last comment on Ukraine.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:41.487]  First of all, the World Economic Forum has been putting out this fellow Yuval Hariri.
[01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:43.611]  Some sort of spokesperson.
[01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:45.733]  Well, I have to tell you something.
[01:39:45.793 --> 01:39:49.757]  He's a history professor of medieval history.
[01:39:50.197 --> 01:39:55.162]  He has absolutely no real authority, I guess.
[01:39:55.382 --> 01:39:59.526]  Sure, they just celebrate him because he says psychotic stuff like, we're going to kill everybody, you're all slaves.
[01:39:59.546 --> 01:40:02.469]  I mean, that's, he's just their spokesperson because he says what they believe.
[01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:13.330]   What I would like, I'm a neuropsychologist by training, and I can tell you, Well, as I said, I never wanted to explain to you the sources of my training, but if you ever have the time, I will.
[01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:14.771]  But I want to tell you something.
[01:40:15.071 --> 01:40:18.092]  All these people that are talking about the brain, they know nothing.
[01:40:18.853 --> 01:40:24.135]  First of all, if you put nanoparticles into the brain and you think you're going to control it, I've got news for you.
[01:40:24.535 --> 01:40:28.136]  The brain has an immune system built in, and you will reject it.
[01:40:28.156 --> 01:40:30.697]  So all you're going to give somebody is Alzheimer's.
[01:40:30.777 --> 01:40:32.118]  All you're going to do is cause brain plaques.
[01:40:32.998 --> 01:40:34.259]  Oh, and you're going to create more than that.
[01:40:34.519 --> 01:40:36.740]  You're going to create a lot of mental illness.
[01:40:37.338 --> 01:40:43.479]  You think your brain has decision-making abilities that are going to be countered by some external unknown force?
[01:40:43.759 --> 01:40:44.359]  You got me.
[01:40:44.499 --> 01:40:44.999]  You're crazy.
[01:40:45.099 --> 01:40:48.600]  Well, you know, they're selling the nanoparticles they're now putting in the food in the U.S.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:52.601]  FDA just said we have no jurisdiction as something that's going to augment us.
[01:40:52.621 --> 01:40:53.381]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:40:53.421 --> 01:40:55.081]  All it's going to cause is mental illness and death.
[01:40:55.561 --> 01:40:56.662]  Thank you so much, Carlos.
[01:40:56.702 --> 01:40:57.362]  Incredible call.
[01:40:57.802 --> 01:40:58.942]  I'd love to have him back on as a guest.
[01:40:58.982 --> 01:40:59.582]  He's so smart.
[01:41:00.042 --> 01:41:03.963]  Really, really well-known scientist up in Canada from Spain.
[01:41:04.543 --> 01:41:05.963]  Alright, let's take another call.
[01:41:06.003 --> 01:41:07.164]  I promise to jam a lot in here.
[01:41:07.644 --> 01:41:08.784]  Who's up next here?
[01:41:08.804 --> 01:41:09.664]  He's been holding the longest.
[01:41:09.684 --> 01:41:12.905]  That would be Rodney in Missouri.
[01:41:12.965 --> 01:41:13.605]  Rodney, welcome.
[01:41:13.625 --> 01:41:14.005]  Go ahead.
[01:41:16.746 --> 01:41:17.686]  Hey Rodney, how you doing, buddy?
[01:41:18.806 --> 01:41:19.666]  Good, how you doing, Alex?
[01:41:19.706 --> 01:41:20.026]  Good, brother.
[01:41:20.066 --> 01:41:20.266]  Go ahead.
[01:41:20.286 --> 01:41:20.786]  You've got two minutes.
[01:41:21.967 --> 01:41:23.287]  Okay, awesome.
[01:41:23.467 --> 01:41:24.447]  I just had an idea.
[01:41:25.527 --> 01:41:29.528]  One thing that I would think a lot of InfoWarriors would have would be gold.
[01:41:30.128 --> 01:41:31.789]  And this may be a stupid idea.
[01:41:31.809 --> 01:41:32.989]  Let me preface it to that.
[01:41:34.468 --> 01:41:47.632]  What if anyone that sent in one ounce of gold, you gave them back a one-tenth ounce gold coin, like a certificate of authenticity, flash... Hey, that'd be great, because I don't have any gold.
[01:41:47.812 --> 01:41:48.492]  I don't have any gold.
[01:41:48.572 --> 01:41:53.994]  I used to have gold, and my ex-wife got in the divorce, but I'm literally out of money myself.
[01:41:55.254 --> 01:41:56.594]  Yeah, no, that's what I was thinking.
[01:41:56.614 --> 01:41:59.095]  It would really help out the InfoWars.
[01:41:59.776 --> 01:42:06.562]  And, you know, anyone that's been in one ounce, get back to one-tenth ounce, and it'd really just be to help the info wars.
[01:42:07.463 --> 01:42:08.524]  That's a beautiful idea.
[01:42:08.564 --> 01:42:19.454]  We ought to print a tenth of an ounce original coin, a minute, and then tell folks, send us your coin, bullion, whatever, and then we'll be able to sell it for the operation, and then they get a little piece of history.
[01:42:20.114 --> 01:42:21.436]  Our listeners would come through with that.
[01:42:21.496 --> 01:42:22.396]  I know they would.
[01:42:22.677 --> 01:42:23.658]  We're going to do that, brother.
[01:42:23.938 --> 01:42:25.099]  Your idea is going to happen.
[01:42:26.172 --> 01:42:29.553]  Yeah, because I think that would be amazing and then, like, you sign all of them.
[01:42:29.613 --> 01:42:33.955]  That would be the main, that would be like the one, only the people that fit into one ounce would get it.
[01:42:34.235 --> 01:42:35.476]  And then you can make nine others.
[01:42:36.096 --> 01:42:37.277]  One trillion percent.
[01:42:37.657 --> 01:42:40.038]  Somebody sends us an ounce of gold, they're going to get a handwritten note.
[01:42:40.438 --> 01:42:43.599]  Because that's what we need is things that have a big profit in them to fight.
[01:42:43.659 --> 01:42:44.900]  I haven't announced this yet.
[01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:50.484]  But we now officially know, and it's going to come out soon, it is George Soros behind all the lawsuits behind us.
[01:42:51.264 --> 01:42:54.747]  And he's basically getting ready to officially announce he's trying to take me down.
[01:42:55.348 --> 01:42:57.649]  So, Rodney, beautiful point.
[01:42:57.829 --> 01:42:59.110]  I'll hold you over in case you got anything else.
[01:42:59.731 --> 01:43:00.872]  And I'm going to get to Marcos.
[01:43:01.352 --> 01:43:04.855]  Trucker Josh Comifornia is up next after Rodney and then Michael as well.
[01:43:05.555 --> 01:43:07.957]  And we got MTG popping in as well with some big news.
[01:43:07.977 --> 01:43:08.378]  Stay with us.
[01:43:09.819 --> 01:43:10.759]  MTG's coming up.
[01:43:10.779 --> 01:43:12.521]  Got a lot of breaking news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:43:14.161 --> 01:43:15.123]  War Rooms at 3 p.m.
[01:43:15.143 --> 01:43:18.128]  Central today with the great Owen Schroyer, who by the way was always a great talk show host.
[01:43:18.669 --> 01:43:22.455]  But man, he is just a dynamite five-star host.
[01:43:22.475 --> 01:43:27.137]   He's really smart and really Really, really gone to a whole other level.
[01:43:27.637 --> 01:43:28.858]  Be sure and check that out.
[01:43:28.898 --> 01:43:30.859]  Same thing here as the Smith Weekday Mornings, 8 a.m.
[01:43:30.939 --> 01:43:33.140]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:43:33.581 --> 01:43:34.701]  Rodney, great idea.
[01:43:34.821 --> 01:43:35.942]  We'll implement that.
[01:43:36.622 --> 01:43:37.843]  We got to fund this operation.
[01:43:37.883 --> 01:43:40.164]  We just got into the black, so everybody keep supporting us.
[01:43:40.184 --> 01:43:41.285]  We'll go right back in the red.
[01:43:41.685 --> 01:43:43.326]  Great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:43:43.346 --> 01:43:44.287]  What else is on your mind, sir?
[01:43:46.928 --> 01:43:50.190]  I've also called in, I was the same guy that called in about Ray Epps.
[01:43:50.985 --> 01:43:55.129]  And at one point, I mean, that was absolutely true what I said, and I don't think he was lying.
[01:43:55.569 --> 01:43:58.411]  But obviously, I think he already had the seizure.
[01:43:58.452 --> 01:44:01.074]  They had the seizure planned so that they could get out.
[01:44:01.634 --> 01:44:05.798]  And one thing I wanted to say, why aren't some of our politicians getting this guy under oath?
[01:44:07.148 --> 01:44:18.812]  Yeah, why does the FBI want to talk to me when I'm on record trying to stop what happened and they know damn well that I was just there giving a speech on the 5th and along for the ride and, you know, trying to organize a peaceful demonstration, same thing I've done many times.
[01:44:19.132 --> 01:44:20.133]  I have no history of that.
[01:44:20.473 --> 01:44:22.273]  It'd be idiotic to take over the Capitol.
[01:44:23.054 --> 01:44:25.274]  It blew up in everybody's face when some people did it.
[01:44:25.554 --> 01:44:28.896]  And you've got all these provocateurs and none of them have been arrested like Ray Epps.
[01:44:28.956 --> 01:44:29.856]  It's ridiculous.
[01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:31.726]  Oh no, you saved me!
[01:44:31.806 --> 01:44:33.188]  You saved me, honestly, you know?
[01:44:33.228 --> 01:44:37.552]  Like, I may have went in if it wasn't for you there saying not to.
[01:44:37.592 --> 01:44:39.194]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:42.137]  Well, God bless you, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:42.177 --> 01:44:47.123]  Let's go to... Commiefornia Dreaming.
[01:44:47.303 --> 01:44:48.104]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:44:49.844 --> 01:44:50.705]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:44:50.745 --> 01:44:51.185]  I love you.
[01:44:52.005 --> 01:44:55.887]  I'm calling because, first of all, I've been listening every day for five years.
[01:44:55.927 --> 01:44:57.468]  I never miss a moment of your show.
[01:44:57.908 --> 01:45:00.530]  I use a whole litany of your products every single day.
[01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:03.752]  I've spent thousands of dollars trying to support the InfoWar.
[01:45:04.352 --> 01:45:34.360]   And the reason I'm calling today, I'll get right to the point, is that the Bible, a lot of people look at the book of Revelation to kind of try to Describe what's going on these days, but I think the book of Judges and the book of Kings are very informative as well because if you look, the Israelites became decadent and disobedient and God allowed enemies to rise up and afflict them and they would get taken over essentially and then God would rise up again.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:41.762]  That's right, both those books are about God warning the Israelites, them becoming decadent again like we are, going back into bondage, having a revival and being delivered again.
[01:45:42.896 --> 01:45:43.236]  Amen.
[01:45:43.897 --> 01:45:59.204]  And I think what's going on now, I spend a lot of time on Gab communicating with people who are patriots, and I love them, but I think a lot of people are still in kind of a cult of Trump and putting a lot of trust in Trump and not trust in God.
[01:45:59.584 --> 01:46:02.425]  Now, let's look at what Trump, we've been seeing from him lately.
[01:46:03.866 --> 01:46:09.353]  You know, first of all, he didn't pardon Assange, which I think is an inexcusable faux pas.
[01:46:10.474 --> 01:46:17.322]  He had Dr. Oz on the stage the other night endorsing him, and Dr. Oz has come out and openly endorsed the death shot.
[01:46:18.443 --> 01:46:25.842]   Trump also touted his partnership with the J&J CEO the other day and bragged about knowing
[01:46:25.842 --> 01:46:31.003]  him and he led Operation Warp Speed.
[01:46:31.003 --> 01:46:35.322]  He's been touting the death shots.
[01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:39.322]   I think at this point we need to realize that we can't put our trust in the man that is
[01:46:39.821 --> 01:46:47.387]  I know that he, you know, first of all, he's either completely tone deaf or he's a capitulated deep stater.
[01:46:47.707 --> 01:46:54.412]  But I think the point is, is we need to, like a lot of the callers have been saying, is get right with God, focus on God.
[01:46:54.792 --> 01:47:03.035]   And when we turn back to the temple, I totally agree.
[01:47:03.075 --> 01:47:04.176]  No king but King Jesus.
[01:47:04.216 --> 01:47:05.637]  Trust in God, not in man.
[01:47:05.657 --> 01:47:07.338]  I don't think Trump's a bad person.
[01:47:08.298 --> 01:47:10.780]  But once he gets committed to something, he's very pig-headed.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.521]  And I agree, he's very tone-deaf with Dr. Oz.
[01:47:13.561 --> 01:47:14.922]  He's making a lot of people mad.
[01:47:14.942 --> 01:47:17.623]  My big issue is the globalists trying to start World War III.
[01:47:18.604 --> 01:47:26.107]  Trying to shut down free speech in America, and I'm just wanting to get a lot of good Republicans elected in the midterms, and Trump's helping do that.
[01:47:26.147 --> 01:47:30.309]  He's not perfect, but I absolutely agree with it, and I've got some major problems.
[01:47:30.329 --> 01:47:30.809]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:30.829 --> 01:47:33.310]  All right, let's take another caller here.
[01:47:33.930 --> 01:47:37.691]  In the order they are received, let's talk to Marcos in Ohio.
[01:47:37.731 --> 01:47:38.752]  Marcos, thanks for calling.
[01:47:39.572 --> 01:47:39.932]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:39.972 --> 01:47:40.512]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:47:40.532 --> 01:47:41.013]  How are you?
[01:47:41.733 --> 01:47:43.614]  You know, I'm in the middle of the fight like all of us, brother.
[01:47:44.334 --> 01:47:46.955]  I'm just trying to get the average person to realize that they're in a fight.
[01:47:48.012 --> 01:47:48.412]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:48.512 --> 01:47:53.315]  Well, I'm just calling to thank you and the crew for everything you do and all the supporters for keeping you going.
[01:47:54.035 --> 01:47:57.557]  And I just had a couple suggestions for the show, if you don't mind.
[01:47:57.577 --> 01:47:57.898]  Please!
[01:47:58.838 --> 01:48:05.662]  I just wondered maybe there's a way you could do like a raffle, say, for a $20 shirt and then charge $5 for an entry.
[01:48:05.742 --> 01:48:07.863]  I bet every bit of 10 people would do it.
[01:48:08.624 --> 01:48:11.085]  There's a lot of ways for us to raise money and we're doing it.
[01:48:11.125 --> 01:48:13.326]  We're just toe-to-toe with Soros trying to shut us down.
[01:48:13.346 --> 01:48:16.008]  We're going to stay on air thanks to all you folks out there.
[01:48:16.872 --> 01:48:17.933]  Yes sir.
[01:48:18.113 --> 01:48:18.774]  Two more things.
[01:48:18.834 --> 01:48:26.641]  I was going to say maybe put a little megaphone icon on your website so I can record a ten second clip to get out to all the other Info Warriors.
[01:48:27.062 --> 01:48:28.763]  Maybe you could charge for it or do it for free.
[01:48:29.724 --> 01:48:33.368]  And I'd ask maybe you could play the National Anthem once a week on your show.
[01:48:33.968 --> 01:48:34.809]  If you could find the time.
[01:48:35.149 --> 01:48:35.710]  Absolutely.
[01:48:38.951 --> 01:48:44.256]  You know, I've got a video of my, she's now five, five-year-old daughter saying the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:48:44.756 --> 01:48:46.538]  She just randomly started saying it the other day.
[01:48:47.459 --> 01:48:49.500]  So I told her, let me find it.
[01:48:49.881 --> 01:48:52.783]  So I told her, I said, well, go ahead and say that again on video here.
[01:48:54.205 --> 01:48:55.146]  Keep going while I find it, sir.
[01:48:56.307 --> 01:48:56.467]  Awesome.
[01:48:56.567 --> 01:48:58.228]  And then that'd be it.
[01:48:58.248 --> 01:49:02.012]  And I'd just like to give a shout out to my friend, Mr. Mahan, and thank you again for everything you do.
[01:49:02.981 --> 01:49:12.494]  Well thank you brother and I really appreciate you guys caring about the show and look, when you just buy the supplements and things like that, it funds the operation.
[01:49:14.791 --> 01:49:16.512]  I mean, everybody needs high-quality B12.
[01:49:16.632 --> 01:49:17.212]  Everybody.
[01:49:17.572 --> 01:49:18.693]  Especially Caucasians.
[01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:25.336]  A lot of Caucasians have a mutation where you can't absorb vitamin B12 very, very easily, or vitamin B, period.
[01:49:25.996 --> 01:49:35.380]  Just like black folks need more vitamin D, or people with brown skin more than white folks, white people especially, northern Europeans, so many issues if you don't have it.
[01:49:35.781 --> 01:49:36.641]  It's back in stock.
[01:49:36.941 --> 01:49:37.761]  We gotta blow it out.
[01:49:37.781 --> 01:49:38.402]  We need the funds.
[01:49:38.422 --> 01:49:46.904]   40% off, even though it's a supply chain breakdown, it's been a long time since we got More of it in and you can also get it with X2.
[01:49:46.964 --> 01:49:52.413]  Now that's going to sell out soon for 40% off as well.
[01:49:53.214 --> 01:49:54.476]  And so again, folks, that is 40.
[01:49:56.616 --> 01:50:02.439]  I'm not going to show her face here, but I'm going to play the audio of my now five-year-old daughter.
[01:50:02.459 --> 01:50:05.581]  I'm just going to show the bottom half of her.
[01:50:05.601 --> 01:50:07.882]  Go ahead and show a video shot of this.
[01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:15.641]   I'm not going to show her face here, but I'm going to play the audio of my now five-year-old
[01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:16.641]  daughter.
[01:50:16.641 --> 01:50:17.641]  I'm just going to show the bottom half of her.
[01:50:17.641 --> 01:50:19.440]  Go ahead and show a video shot of this.
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:24.440]   I want you to hear her saying the national anthem just out of the blue.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:34.640]   I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:41.640]   which it stands, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.481]  Good stuff.
[01:50:43.481 --> 01:50:44.581]  (blows raspberry)
[01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.520]  And that's what the future is all about.
[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.942]  And you can say, well America's not perfect.
[01:50:48.382 --> 01:50:49.424]  We shouldn't pledge allegiance to it.
[01:50:49.464 --> 01:50:50.665]  Okay, what are you going to pledge allegiance to?
[01:50:51.286 --> 01:50:51.987]  The New World Order?
[01:50:52.087 --> 01:50:52.788]  Klaus Schwab?
[01:50:52.968 --> 01:50:53.509]  The UN?
[01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:55.171]  The Hollywood?
[01:50:55.271 --> 01:50:56.032]  Democratic Party?
[01:50:56.052 --> 01:50:57.453]  The Church of Satan?
[01:51:00.557 --> 01:51:02.740]  That's the question there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:03.746 --> 01:51:05.587]  All right, Marcos, thank you so much for the call.
[01:51:06.107 --> 01:51:08.829]  All right, Trucker Josh and Michael, if you want to hold on, I'd love for you to.
[01:51:08.889 --> 01:51:10.289]  If not, I'm sorry you've had to hold so long.
[01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:11.510]  You can come on with us.
[01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:20.734]  I'd love to hear from you after MTG joins us with some big breaking news on the other side of so many fronts, including the court saying, OK, you're allowed to run.
[01:51:21.695 --> 01:51:24.216]  The Democrats can't disqualify you for no reason.
[01:51:25.397 --> 01:51:27.117]  So I wanted to get her on.
[01:51:27.578 --> 01:51:29.118]  She has joined us very graciously.
[01:51:29.158 --> 01:51:30.039]  We appreciate that.
[01:51:30.699 --> 01:51:31.920]  We've got this other George Soros.
[01:51:33.836 --> 01:51:48.995]  Well, George Soros and the Democratic Party tried as hard as they could to stop her from being able to run for Congress again because they want to stop the will of the voters.
[01:51:49.736 --> 01:51:55.901]  They wanted to do that because she wanted to question the election results, something they do almost every major election.
[01:51:56.641 --> 01:52:00.144]  Challenge over Marjorie Taylor Greene's eligibility fails.
[01:52:00.865 --> 01:52:05.508]  Shame on them, and it's failed on a bunch of other members of Congress as well.
[01:52:05.568 --> 01:52:20.680]   Meanwhile, we have George Soros operative appointed as Biden's Ministry of Truth co-chair, and we have 20 states threaten legal action over DHS Ministry of Truth Board, MTG on the road, graciously popping in for just a little while.
[01:52:20.781 --> 01:52:21.601]  Thank you so much.
[01:52:21.902 --> 01:52:25.965]  And I want to say congratulations, you know, for fighting back and winning.
[01:52:26.005 --> 01:52:28.447]  But at the same time, you shouldn't have even had to be in court.
[01:52:28.528 --> 01:52:29.709]  You don't have a criminal record.
[01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.050]  You weren't under indictment.
[01:52:31.090 --> 01:52:31.871]  You're not a felon.
[01:52:32.131 --> 01:52:33.432]  They had no reason to do this.
[01:52:33.492 --> 01:52:34.733]  This really discredits them.
[01:52:35.033 --> 01:52:36.435]  But congratulations still.
[01:52:37.557 --> 01:52:38.478]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:52:38.538 --> 01:52:44.281]  And it does discredit them and shame on them for ever putting me through this and putting the people in my district through this.
[01:52:44.722 --> 01:52:46.603]  You know, people have been really upset around here.
[01:52:46.663 --> 01:52:48.144]  They've been talking about lawsuits.
[01:52:48.584 --> 01:52:56.389]  They've been talking about how can we get these attorneys disbarred because they're perversing our courtrooms, politicizing our courtrooms.
[01:52:56.769 --> 01:52:58.971]  And frankly, that's really election meddling.
[01:52:59.191 --> 01:52:59.992]  That's what they're doing.
[01:53:00.032 --> 01:53:01.873]  They're trying to meddle in our Georgia election.
[01:53:02.673 --> 01:53:08.477]  Because we were willing to ask questions and work hard and object on January 6th.
[01:53:08.537 --> 01:53:16.382]  There's nothing wrong with objecting, and none of us had anything to do with what happened, you know, the riot and all that on January 6th.
[01:53:16.862 --> 01:53:24.767]  But you know, these same people, you don't see them crying out about abortion protesters showing up at Supreme Court Justice Houses.
[01:53:24.807 --> 01:53:27.329]  You don't see any of that, and that's completely illegal.
[01:53:27.729 --> 01:53:30.692]  But, you know, this is the way it rolls in politics.
[01:53:30.732 --> 01:53:37.840]  The Democrats will do anything they can to destroy our freedoms, and that's what they're trying to do right now.
[01:53:40.097 --> 01:53:41.418]  Where do you go from here?
[01:53:41.839 --> 01:53:45.121]  Because you shouldn't even have to sit there and been on the stand.
[01:53:45.201 --> 01:53:50.746]  Although, how dare you say that Nancy Pelosi has engaged in treasonous activity?
[01:53:51.106 --> 01:53:57.252]  Everything they've done, cutting off our pipelines, our energy, leaving our borders totally undefended in the South.
[01:53:57.672 --> 01:54:00.755]  I mean, all these things are what I would call classical treason.
[01:54:02.250 --> 01:54:03.010]  Of course they are.
[01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:07.531]  And I mean, that's what their job is to do is to protect our borders.
[01:54:07.671 --> 01:54:11.192]  They're supposed to protect the borders of the state.
[01:54:11.312 --> 01:54:12.833]  That's the role of the federal government.
[01:54:13.473 --> 01:54:14.853]  They've completely abandoned that.
[01:54:15.193 --> 01:54:18.494]  I mean, our government is allowing our country to be overrun.
[01:54:18.534 --> 01:54:19.974]  They're helping it be overrun.
[01:54:20.014 --> 01:54:21.015]  They're enabling it.
[01:54:21.375 --> 01:54:25.916]  Joe Biden has basically invited everyone to just come on into the United States.
[01:54:26.476 --> 01:54:31.137]  And he's the best friends and the best business partner with the cartels they've ever had.
[01:54:31.617 --> 01:54:34.337]   But yeah, what's going on right now is totally out of control.
[01:54:34.337 --> 01:54:38.536]   And here's something I've been asking questions about, Alex, and maybe you can help me out
[01:54:38.536 --> 01:54:41.216]  because I've got no answers from anyone else.
[01:54:41.216 --> 01:54:50.217]   Here's the FBI geofencing around the Capitol to go after people that rioted and walked around,
[01:54:50.217 --> 01:54:53.777]   you know, the MAGA grandmas and tourists that walked around inside the Capitol.
[01:54:53.777 --> 01:55:01.577]   Then we have, you know, the CDC using geofencing to track people's movements during lockdowns
[01:55:01.577 --> 01:55:04.936]   tyrannical lockdowns that should have never happened in the first place.
[01:55:04.936 --> 01:55:08.016]  But now we've got a movie that came out, "2,000 Mules,"
[01:55:08.016 --> 01:55:13.817]   and I can't get anybody in my state to buy geofencing data and aggregate it
[01:55:13.817 --> 01:55:18.817]   to track, you know, absentee ballot traffickers, which we know happened.
[01:55:19.087 --> 01:55:24.234]  So I've been making a bunch of phone calls because I'm really upset about this, and I think it's time that this gets investigated.
[01:55:25.455 --> 01:55:26.435]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:55:26.475 --> 01:55:36.579]  They use all this geolocating against peaceful Americans and to track everybody illegally under COVID, but known criminals in other situations with human trafficking, oh, suddenly they can't use it.
[01:55:38.240 --> 01:55:39.000]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:40.181]  It's insane.
[01:55:40.241 --> 01:55:42.061]  And it makes no sense whatsoever.
[01:55:42.842 --> 01:55:52.104]   But, you know, if they can use it, then I think we should be able to use it, too, and find out how people What they did with these absentee ballots.
[01:55:52.144 --> 01:55:55.768]  And these are the right things to look into, you know?
[01:55:55.968 --> 01:55:56.949]  And they did.
[01:55:56.969 --> 01:55:59.873]  I mean, I watched that movie just this past week and I was shocked.
[01:56:00.433 --> 01:56:01.294]  Absolutely shocked.
[01:56:01.454 --> 01:56:04.538]  And also blown away at the hard work of the people at True the Vote.
[01:56:05.018 --> 01:56:10.441]  That we're able to solve the mystery that no one else apparently has been able to solve.
[01:56:10.821 --> 01:56:13.883]  But I'm really hoping that I see people step up to the plate.
[01:56:14.183 --> 01:56:15.844]  I'm tired of the arguments and politics.
[01:56:15.884 --> 01:56:21.187]  I just want people to do the right thing, enforce our laws, and make sure that this never happens again.
[01:56:22.355 --> 01:56:23.696]  I'm glad you raised this film.
[01:56:23.716 --> 01:56:26.317]  That was one of the topics I wanted to get to with you.
[01:56:26.577 --> 01:56:27.177]  I've seen it now.
[01:56:27.217 --> 01:56:27.997]  Very powerful.
[01:56:28.198 --> 01:56:28.918]  Geolocating.
[01:56:28.958 --> 01:56:29.798]  Shows all the proof.
[01:56:30.278 --> 01:56:33.500]  The same people putting in hundreds and hundreds of ballots at multiple locations.
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:36.581]  And the Democrats spin and say, oh, they're voting for their family.
[01:56:36.881 --> 01:56:38.042]  They're wearing plastic gloves.
[01:56:38.062 --> 01:56:38.782]  They're wearing masks.
[01:56:39.122 --> 01:56:42.424]  We know this is how they did it, Congresswoman.
[01:56:42.504 --> 01:56:44.065]  And now we have a smoking gun.
[01:56:44.365 --> 01:56:45.185]  And so what are they doing?
[01:56:45.205 --> 01:56:47.006]  They're suppressing it and censoring it, of course.
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:48.901]  Yes, of course.
[01:56:49.021 --> 01:56:50.962]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:56:51.242 --> 01:56:53.404]  So, you know, everyone is waiting.
[01:56:53.484 --> 01:56:56.826]  They're like, when is someone going to finally prosecute this?
[01:56:56.966 --> 01:57:01.049]  And now the True the Vote people, they have done all the hard work.
[01:57:01.529 --> 01:57:06.192]  So I'm really hoping to see people in Georgia step up to the plate and investigate it.
[01:57:06.232 --> 01:57:09.654]  Because if what's good for the goose, it's got to be good for the gander.
[01:57:10.155 --> 01:57:15.419]   And if the FBI can use CO fencing data, To go after people around the Capitol.
[01:57:15.459 --> 01:57:19.843]  The CDC can use geofencing data tracking people during lockdowns.
[01:57:20.224 --> 01:57:30.795]  Then surely to God, people here in Georgia and Wisconsin, Arizona, all these other states can use the same methods and stop this criminal activity before they do it again.
[01:57:31.155 --> 01:57:37.099]  Because I'll tell you what, Alex, Stacey Abrams, she wants more than anything to be governor of Georgia.
[01:57:37.339 --> 01:57:42.943]  And so don't, I mean, it'd be foolish to think she wouldn't do this and help this to happen again.
[01:57:43.083 --> 01:57:45.604]  So I'm just starting to make phone calls.
[01:57:45.644 --> 01:57:50.847]  I've been making phone calls and I want people to give me an answer on why we are not using this method.
[01:57:51.408 --> 01:57:54.570]  The people that true the vote should have never had to spend the money to do it in the first place.
[01:57:54.990 --> 01:58:02.574]   We should have the people that it's their jobs to, you know, uphold the law and prosecute Absolutely.
[01:58:02.614 --> 01:58:10.555]  Let me ask you this, with 183 days out from this midterm, all the political science and numbers show, biggest political realignment in U.S.
[01:58:10.595 --> 01:58:10.855]  history.
[01:58:10.875 --> 01:58:15.776]  It was already happening in the last six, seven years, but the attempts to suppress us have only supercharged it.
[01:58:16.316 --> 01:58:19.757]  We're seeing double, triple the numbers in blacks and Hispanics saying they're going to vote Republican.
[01:58:20.317 --> 01:58:23.578]  Democratic voters at record levels said they're going to vote Republican.
[01:58:24.459 --> 01:58:26.964]  What's the Deep State Democratic Party going to do?
[01:58:27.345 --> 01:58:29.870]  You're up there around these swamp creatures all day long.
[01:58:30.431 --> 01:58:31.974]  What are they planning to do to try to stop this?
[01:58:31.994 --> 01:58:35.080]  Because I know they don't want this landslide to happen.
[01:58:36.206 --> 01:58:37.887]  Well, they've got to blame Putin, of course.
[01:58:37.967 --> 01:58:43.768]  They've got to blame Putin and blame the war in Ukraine for the high inflation and the high gas prices.
[01:58:43.828 --> 01:58:46.829]  And everybody knows that is a load of BS.
[01:58:46.969 --> 01:58:47.789]  No one is buying it.
[01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:50.430]  This inflation started happening before this.
[01:58:50.850 --> 01:58:53.891]  The gas prices were going out of control before that happened.
[01:58:54.391 --> 01:58:55.852]  And, you know, I'm out here in my district.
[01:58:56.112 --> 01:58:57.292]  It's absolutely beautiful.
[01:58:57.752 --> 01:58:58.953]  And I've been talking to farmers.
[01:58:59.993 --> 01:59:12.159]  Day after day, Alex, and I can't tell you how much trouble farmers are in right now because this inflation and the cost of fuel going up has made their jobs that are already difficult.
[01:59:12.699 --> 01:59:21.163]  A lot of times farmers have been barely getting by for decades now because of government regulations and all the stuff that goes on with it that makes it difficult.
[01:59:21.483 --> 01:59:27.024]  But now inflation and gas prices is making it to where many of them are talking about going out of business.
[01:59:27.384 --> 01:59:33.545]  Cattle farmers are talking about selling their cattle at the end of the season and never being able to be cattle farmers anymore.
[01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:36.966]  Chicken integrators, small farms, they are crumbling.
[01:59:37.306 --> 01:59:43.908]  And I want to tell you how scary this is because our food security is our national security.
[01:59:44.008 --> 01:59:45.968]  Food security is national security, Alex.
[01:59:46.608 --> 02:00:17.224]   And when our government leaders are making it impossible for farmers to be able to continue to farm, when they make it impossible for cattle farmers to be able to afford to grow and bale hay and grow their animals and feed them and sell them at market to make a profit, They are failing the best people in our country because our farmers stand for all of our values, traditional family values, freedom, independence, the ability to live and sustain yourself and your family off the land.
[02:00:17.543 --> 02:00:20.663]  The Biden administration and Democrats are ruining that.
[02:00:20.663 --> 02:00:26.003]   And they're destroying the very important, most critical part of the fabric of America.
[02:00:26.003 --> 02:00:27.583]  And that is our farmers.
[02:00:27.583 --> 02:00:32.043]   And I'm so upset about this, it has me so angry, but they're doing it on purpose.
[02:00:32.043 --> 02:00:35.063]  I mean, they want to be the global economy.
[02:00:35.063 --> 02:00:37.222]  They want to be completely involved.
[02:00:37.222 --> 02:00:42.422]   And here we have these random, supposedly accidental fires at food processing plants.
[02:00:42.422 --> 02:00:46.663]   Hold on, I know you're on the side of the road and graciously stopped to talk to us,
[02:00:46.663 --> 02:00:50.703]   but just do a few more minutes on the other side, 'cause I wanna, now Walmart distribution centers
[02:00:50.703 --> 02:00:52.302]  are blowing up and burning down.
[02:00:51.872 --> 02:00:53.313]  Now it's over 50 of these centers.
[02:00:53.754 --> 02:00:55.835]  I've talked to statisticians and insurance companies.
[02:00:56.235 --> 02:00:57.536]  I know Tucker Carlson looked into it.
[02:00:57.596 --> 02:00:59.317]  It's mathematically impossible.
[02:00:59.537 --> 02:01:01.799]  It's one out of like a billion for this to be happening.
[02:01:01.919 --> 02:01:02.880]  What is going on?
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:09.464]  Everything The Globalist is doing is about destroying real sustainability and making things collapse to bring in their new world order.
[02:01:09.644 --> 02:01:11.425]  We'll talk about it with MTG straight ahead.
[02:01:11.666 --> 02:01:12.066]  Stay with us.
[02:01:12.686 --> 02:01:14.007]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:18.071]  MTG is our guest for a few more minutes.
[02:01:18.091 --> 02:01:34.644]  Stops on the side of the road to speak to us and talk about the outrageous nature of the Democratic Party lawyers all over the country trying to keep Congress members from running for Congress, to be re-elected because they dare question the 2020 election, proving that they want to steal elections.
[02:01:34.704 --> 02:01:35.664]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:01:36.818 --> 02:01:47.482]  Oh, you're saying we want to steal elections so you can't run for election when our own State Department goes around the world trying to mine other people's elections, but we can't even pass our own State Department rules here in the United States.
[02:01:47.502 --> 02:02:00.706]  But you were getting into something, MTG, really central here, and that is these giant distribution centers and food factories and processing facilities blowing up and burning up every day.
[02:02:00.947 --> 02:02:02.267]  Statistically impossible.
[02:02:02.667 --> 02:02:04.648]  You've got a lot of connections, a lot of intel.
[02:02:05.911 --> 02:02:13.035]  We look at the pipelines being shut down, the dollar being devalued, the cloud and pivot strategy to bring America to its knees by destroying capitalism, by sabotage.
[02:02:13.535 --> 02:02:14.596]  That's what this is.
[02:02:14.656 --> 02:02:16.317]  I mean, there's so many signs of it everywhere.
[02:02:16.657 --> 02:02:18.518]  What do you think's really going on and what are you hearing?
[02:02:20.079 --> 02:02:25.762]  Well, I think people are beginning to realize this may be more than just a coincidence.
[02:02:25.962 --> 02:02:31.005]  And I can tell you, you know, manufacturing plants, it is common that there can be fires.
[02:02:31.505 --> 02:02:35.027]  Sometimes if a manufacturing plant is old, occasionally a fire will happen.
[02:02:35.547 --> 02:02:39.890]  But this is such a common occurrence right now, especially in the past few months, Alex.
[02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:42.011]  It doesn't seem to be a coincidence.
[02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:43.992]  And it shouldn't be happening.
[02:02:44.012 --> 02:02:48.434]  And why is it food processing plants over and over and over like you're talking about?
[02:02:48.874 --> 02:02:53.017]  And it's extremely concerning at a time where inflation is out of control.
[02:02:53.037 --> 02:02:55.178]  Food prices are already so expensive.
[02:02:56.078 --> 02:03:07.981]  And farmers are suffering and we're looking at looking at the real possibility of food shortages this summer just because of the way the Biden administration has completely mismanaged America's economy.
[02:03:08.001 --> 02:03:13.602]  I think everyone should be concerned about this is certainly something that I'm paying attention to.
[02:03:13.663 --> 02:03:26.911]   My team is starting to ask questions on and I don't think it, you know, I don't want to I don't want to speculate, but there's too many food processing plants this is happening at, and it's too frequent of an occurrence.
[02:03:27.191 --> 02:03:29.414]  And no one in charge seems to care.
[02:03:29.474 --> 02:03:31.856]  We don't see the FBI or the Department of Justice.
[02:03:31.876 --> 02:03:35.840]  We don't see people holding press conferences saying, what is going on?
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:43.608]  You know, we've got mothers at grocery stores crying because they can't find baby formula, which is just horrendous and heartbreaking.
[02:03:44.388 --> 02:03:51.510]  But I think we have a real crisis on our hands and I think it's something that people need to pay serious attention to and demand investigations happen.
[02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.590]  Well that's right.
[02:03:52.630 --> 02:03:59.151]  Maybe if the FBI wasn't using thousands and thousands of agents to harass January 6th peaceful protesters, we would have answers.
[02:03:59.371 --> 02:04:02.472]  Or we'd know about all the increases in child smuggling on the border.
[02:04:02.492 --> 02:04:03.932]  I want to hit one more topic.
[02:04:03.972 --> 02:04:07.233]  The big disinformation board run by George Soros.
[02:04:07.593 --> 02:04:10.033]  Mayorkas was in front of the Senate last week.
[02:04:10.073 --> 02:04:12.094]  There's a short clip of Senator Paul destroying him.
[02:04:12.984 --> 02:04:14.505]  Do we have policies?
[02:04:14.885 --> 02:04:16.306]  Do we have guardrails?
[02:04:16.746 --> 02:04:17.867]  Do we have standards?
[02:04:17.887 --> 02:04:18.748]  But here's the problem.
[02:04:18.788 --> 02:04:19.748]  We can't even agree.
[02:04:19.808 --> 02:04:22.250]  We can't even agree what disinformation is.
[02:04:22.690 --> 02:04:27.633]  You can't even agree that it was disinformation that the Russians fed information to the Steele dossier.
[02:04:27.673 --> 02:04:33.237]  If you can't agree to that, how are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation so you can police it on social media?
[02:04:34.145 --> 02:04:38.469]  I think you've got no idea what disinformation is and I don't think the government's capable of it.
[02:04:38.690 --> 02:04:42.093]  Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is?
[02:04:42.113 --> 02:04:43.034]  The U.S.
[02:04:43.074 --> 02:04:43.534]  government.
[02:04:44.135 --> 02:04:45.576]  Are you familiar with McNamara?
[02:04:46.137 --> 02:04:46.958]  The Pentagon Papers?
[02:04:48.134 --> 02:04:51.556]  Are you familiar with George W. Bush and the weapons of mass destruction?
[02:04:51.576 --> 02:04:54.158]  Are you familiar with Iran-Contra?
[02:04:54.878 --> 02:05:00.301]  I mean, think of all the debates and disputes we've had over the last 50 years in our country.
[02:05:00.862 --> 02:05:02.903]  We work them out by debating them.
[02:05:02.923 --> 02:05:05.244]  We don't work them out by the government being the arbiter.
[02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.785]  I don't want you to guard rails.
[02:05:07.025 --> 02:05:08.806]  I want you to have nothing to do with speech.
[02:05:09.227 --> 02:05:10.688]  You think we can't determine?
[02:05:11.588 --> 02:05:14.312]  You know, speech by traffickers is disinformation?
[02:05:14.592 --> 02:05:18.057]  You think the American people are so stupid they need you to tell them what the truth is?
[02:05:18.397 --> 02:05:21.081]  You can't even admit what the truth is with a Steele dossier.
[02:05:21.381 --> 02:05:23.725]  I don't trust government to figure out what the truth is.
[02:05:24.305 --> 02:05:27.530]  Government is largely disseminating disinformation.
[02:05:27.890 --> 02:05:30.113]  Government is the largest susceptor of disinformation.
[02:05:30.533 --> 02:05:31.694]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:05:31.734 --> 02:05:34.958]  And mainstream media lies on purpose and has the lowest approval rating with the public anywhere.
[02:05:35.458 --> 02:05:39.703]  So it's preposterous when you pull back that they want to disqualify you for running for office for no reason.
[02:05:40.384 --> 02:05:44.088]  They want to censor everybody with a censorship board, a literal ministry of truth.
[02:05:44.809 --> 02:05:46.831]  I know there's calls in Congress to block this.
[02:05:46.851 --> 02:05:48.633]  Where do you see that going, Congresswoman?
[02:05:49.739 --> 02:05:52.321]  I just want to say God bless Rand Paul.
[02:05:52.781 --> 02:05:53.501]  He just said it.
[02:05:53.781 --> 02:05:54.802]  I haven't seen that clip yet.
[02:05:54.842 --> 02:05:55.843]  That's fantastic.
[02:05:56.223 --> 02:05:58.084]  I mean, what about misinformation?
[02:05:58.104 --> 02:06:09.511]   I love it that he brought up weapons of mass destruction leading the United States into invading Iraq after 19 terrorists from Saudi Arabia, you know, pulled off 9-11.
[02:06:09.951 --> 02:06:11.631]  So, you know, there's so many things.
[02:06:11.671 --> 02:06:13.272]  You can't trust the government.
[02:06:13.972 --> 02:06:17.173]  They shouldn't be in charge of what's information and what's not misinformation.
[02:06:17.533 --> 02:06:19.594]  Senator Paul, he's completely correct.
[02:06:20.054 --> 02:06:23.095]  The government is the biggest distributor of misinformation.
[02:06:23.635 --> 02:06:26.036]  So we don't want their ministry of truth.
[02:06:26.396 --> 02:06:26.756]  It's not 1984.
[02:06:26.896 --> 02:06:32.658]  We're in 2022 and we really don't want that type of communism in America.
[02:06:33.458 --> 02:06:41.620]  So I think the November elections can't come quick enough, Alex, and I think people are eyes wide open.
[02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:51.763]  I think the Democrats are going to be shocked that voters don't really feel like the bots and the trolls and the little activists on Twitter say they feel.
[02:06:52.223 --> 02:06:53.964]  They're going to find out something different.
[02:06:54.502 --> 02:06:58.304]  And that's why they're in a race to bankrupt the country and have it in such disarray.
[02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:02.846]  Try to cause a civil war over this Roe V Wade thing that we're all distracted by that, but it's not going to work.
[02:07:03.166 --> 02:07:06.387]  How do people find everything MTG in Congress?
[02:07:06.768 --> 02:07:07.948]  You've also got your own website.
[02:07:07.968 --> 02:07:09.409]  Your congressional site is awesome.
[02:07:09.989 --> 02:07:11.990]  What's the best site for folks to visit, Congresswoman?
[02:07:13.004 --> 02:07:14.506]  Well, check out my social media.
[02:07:14.546 --> 02:07:19.371]  I try to keep the information out there, not the misinformation like the Democrats do.
[02:07:19.431 --> 02:07:21.793]  But yeah, anywhere you can find me on social media.
[02:07:21.813 --> 02:07:22.894]  I'm on all the platforms.
[02:07:23.034 --> 02:07:25.137]  I'm hanging on by a thread on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:07:25.177 --> 02:07:27.839]  They've almost banned me, but I'm on all the others.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:29.741]  Look for the verified accounts.
[02:07:29.922 --> 02:07:31.083]  Don't go for the fake accounts.
[02:07:31.543 --> 02:07:42.531]  But mtg4america.com is my website, and I just want to thank everyone for your great support when they were trying to get my name off the ballot, and I just want to say we won.
[02:07:42.652 --> 02:07:45.634]  They couldn't get rid of me, so thank you everyone for your help.
[02:07:46.114 --> 02:07:47.495]  I'm going to let you go, but I forgot one more thing.
[02:07:47.515 --> 02:07:53.300]  That was a very powerful press conference you gave where you said myself and Milo and others need to be on a roundtable with Elon Musk.
[02:07:53.600 --> 02:07:55.781]  Elon says it'll take a few months to get control of Twitter.
[02:07:56.182 --> 02:07:58.484]  Do you think he'll give you back your main Twitter?
[02:07:59.404 --> 02:08:00.765]  Do you think he'll put me back on?
[02:08:00.826 --> 02:08:02.487]  Do you think he'll put President Trump back on?
[02:08:02.527 --> 02:08:03.828]  What do you think of Elon Musk in closing?
[02:08:04.769 --> 02:08:06.330]  Well, I don't know.
[02:08:06.551 --> 02:08:14.818]  I judge someone by their actions and not by their words, and I'm really waiting to see what Elon Musk's actions are going to be as far as protecting freedom of speech.
[02:08:15.178 --> 02:08:23.145]  I certainly hope he takes up my invitation for a roundtable, and Alex, I would love to have you there if we can make that happen.
[02:08:24.190 --> 02:08:27.272]  I would love to be there as well, and I'm going to take you up on the invitation soon to come to D.C.
[02:08:27.292 --> 02:08:28.232]  and get that tour of the Capitol.
[02:08:28.472 --> 02:08:29.593]  Thank you so much, MTG.
[02:08:29.613 --> 02:08:30.033]  We love you.
[02:08:31.394 --> 02:08:31.534]  OK.
[02:08:31.574 --> 02:08:32.134]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:08:32.355 --> 02:08:32.615]  Bye.
[02:08:32.835 --> 02:08:33.535]  What a great lady.
[02:08:34.075 --> 02:08:36.597]  We need a lot more people like her in Congress.
[02:08:36.637 --> 02:08:38.958]  They are so afraid of her.
[02:08:39.038 --> 02:08:39.338]  All right.
[02:08:39.378 --> 02:08:40.519]  I'm going to start the fourth hour.
[02:08:41.199 --> 02:08:42.500]  I'm going to do about 10, 15 minutes.
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:43.661]  Gerald Slint, he'll take over.
[02:08:43.941 --> 02:08:46.462]  Always does a very informative job, a riveting job.
[02:08:46.482 --> 02:08:49.344]  I'm going to finish up with Trucker, Josh and Michael in a minute.
[02:08:50.197 --> 02:08:51.158]  When we come back.
[02:08:51.718 --> 02:08:55.700]  Briefly, though, because I've barely been plugging today, and if I don't, we won't be on air.
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.081]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:08:57.121 --> 02:08:59.202]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[02:08:59.902 --> 02:09:04.564]  If you don't have vitamin B12 of the high-quality, organic type in your life, you're crazy.
[02:09:05.425 --> 02:09:09.027]  And I'm not going to get into why Caucasians particularly need it, but everybody needs it.
[02:09:09.667 --> 02:09:10.528]  It's back in stock.
[02:09:10.828 --> 02:09:11.448]  It's amazing.
[02:09:11.648 --> 02:09:12.308]  Take it under the tongue.
[02:09:12.348 --> 02:09:12.829]  Tastes great.
[02:09:12.889 --> 02:09:13.509]  Totally natural.
[02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:14.690]  There's no flavors in it.
[02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:16.270]  Natural B12 tastes sweet.
[02:09:16.851 --> 02:09:19.012]  It is great for adults, children, especially old people.
[02:09:20.518 --> 02:09:21.819]  It is 40% off.
[02:09:22.799 --> 02:09:24.280]  And X2 is going to sell out soon.
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.301]  But despite that, I'm comboing it in a combo deal.
[02:09:28.741 --> 02:09:31.262]  X2, the deeper crystal iodine that's beyond essential.
[02:09:31.903 --> 02:09:41.307]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, 40% off together at InfoWarsTore.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:09:41.767 --> 02:09:43.227]  You notice something on the screen right there?
[02:09:43.788 --> 02:09:47.089]  I didn't talk about this for a few months because I wanted to wait and give them a chance to go back on it.
[02:09:48.595 --> 02:09:52.758]  Power Reviews is one of the largest online third-party review sites in the world.
[02:09:53.438 --> 02:09:54.499]  We had them for a decade.
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.401]  We had hundreds of thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:09:58.001 --> 02:10:02.264]  Things like X2 had over 7,000 five-star reviews and 99% approval rating.
[02:10:03.265 --> 02:10:09.970]  And it got sold to a leftist company and they said, we're not going to let you have your reviews.
[02:10:11.326 --> 02:10:17.488]  Real reviews, real people, third-party site, vetted, confirmed, and gone.
[02:10:18.208 --> 02:10:35.292]  Every piece of software, everything we have taken away so that you can't write a review, so that people can't see those five stars, and so that people can't see that information, and so that folks can't come together and promote a product.
[02:10:36.092 --> 02:10:38.253]  But you're still going to do it word of mouth, you're not going to let them stop us.
[02:10:38.293 --> 02:10:39.653]  But that did hurt the site.
[02:10:40.512 --> 02:10:40.972]  Losing that.
[02:10:41.953 --> 02:10:44.295]  And then we fought with them and said, can we at least have the old reviews?
[02:10:44.596 --> 02:10:46.237]  And they, oh yeah, we'll give it to you, never did.
[02:10:47.158 --> 02:10:48.119]  So you think about that.
[02:10:48.579 --> 02:10:50.220]  And by the way, you gotta pay for the service.
[02:10:51.281 --> 02:10:52.823]  So it's a third-party vetting system.
[02:10:53.043 --> 02:10:54.204]  They make sure you've bought it.
[02:10:54.604 --> 02:10:56.286]  They do spot checks to make sure you did the review.
[02:10:57.819 --> 02:10:59.241]  And they took it away from us, folks.
[02:10:59.281 --> 02:11:01.043]  We paid for it every year.
[02:11:01.063 --> 02:11:03.065]  50-something thousand dollars.
[02:11:03.085 --> 02:11:04.026]  You think, well, why do you pay for that?
[02:11:04.466 --> 02:11:05.548]  Because you need reviews.
[02:11:06.268 --> 02:11:09.592]  And I guess we can create our own review system, but that's why we're busy.
[02:11:09.652 --> 02:11:10.613]  That's why we need more money.
[02:11:10.914 --> 02:11:19.163]  That's why we're constantly fighting, because we got to have our own servers, our own incurters, our own uplinks, our own systems, our own bandwidth, our own crew, our own legal.
[02:11:19.503 --> 02:11:22.844]  Our own everything is all compartmentalized here, so please support us.
[02:11:23.104 --> 02:11:24.984]  Get great products at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:11:25.324 --> 02:11:26.865]  The new immune support is amazing as well.
[02:11:27.205 --> 02:11:30.086]  InfoWarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:11:30.646 --> 02:11:32.946]  We're selling out of the t-shirts.
[02:11:32.966 --> 02:11:34.867]  80% of the t-shirts are sold.
[02:11:34.967 --> 02:11:35.907]  They're all limited edition.
[02:11:35.947 --> 02:11:39.848]  We'll never make them again, and we're selling them at cost other than the 1776 shirt.
[02:11:39.668 --> 02:12:02.547]   shirt. Hour number four, straight ahead and then in one hour, the War Room.
[02:12:02.547 --> 02:12:06.187]   And we've been getting a lot of crypto donations, which is keeping us on air. I want to salute
[02:12:06.187 --> 02:12:18.988]   all those you know who you are, the beginning of the donations, please go to Infowars.com/crypto.
[02:12:18.988 --> 02:12:20.588]  Whether it's a dollar.
[02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:26.554]  In Ethereum or Bitcoin, wherever it is, whether it's $1,000 or $1,000,000, we will use it to fight the new world order.
[02:12:26.594 --> 02:12:30.156]  Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Litecoin.
[02:12:30.476 --> 02:12:31.717]  There's dozens of them there.
[02:12:32.237 --> 02:12:33.778]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:12:33.838 --> 02:12:36.820]  And by the way, we've got our own NFTs at Arnescam.
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:40.042]  They're totally badass and total victory coming out next week.
[02:12:40.082 --> 02:12:40.943]  I'll tell you about that later.
[02:12:41.303 --> 02:12:44.284]  But right now, InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[02:12:44.324 --> 02:12:46.384]  The real revolution is happening now.
[02:12:46.464 --> 02:12:48.684]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[02:12:48.524 --> 02:12:51.244]  doing all you donated we salute you and thank you.
[02:12:51.244 --> 02:12:58.084]  I won't get what I'm after.
[02:12:58.106 --> 02:13:04.247]  All right, let's take your calls right now.
[02:13:07.027 --> 02:13:09.188]  Let's go to Michael in Ohio, then Trucker Josh.
[02:13:09.288 --> 02:13:09.908]  Welcome, Michael.
[02:13:09.928 --> 02:13:10.468]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:12.593 --> 02:13:16.116]  Yeah, I'm glad that you put me on hold for a little bit longer, Alex.
[02:13:17.096 --> 02:13:19.638]  You know, that's an idea, too.
[02:13:19.698 --> 02:13:24.261]  Have kids singing the National Anthem and kids doing the Pledge of Allegiance.
[02:13:25.802 --> 02:13:27.923]  That really hits home with us.
[02:13:28.403 --> 02:13:36.589]  But I wanted to call and say, we need more of the Info Wars stickers that just has the black and white.
[02:13:37.129 --> 02:13:41.532]  Because last time I did it at work, we filled the work and we've had so much turnover.
[02:13:42.664 --> 02:13:47.825]  It's time to do it again because they're starting about bringing the masks back at my job and everything.
[02:13:48.526 --> 02:13:53.567]  So in a factory, I just say things like, who is Karl Schwab?
[02:13:53.987 --> 02:13:55.647]  Who is World Economic Forum?
[02:13:56.167 --> 02:14:02.089]  And the people that are watching the news, like Tucker Carlson, they come to me and they're like, how do you how do you know about this stuff?
[02:14:02.109 --> 02:14:03.729]  Tucker Carlson just talked about that.
[02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:04.730]  You've been saying it for weeks.
[02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:08.410]  I'm like, I'm telling you, Infowars, please, please go to the site.
[02:14:08.510 --> 02:14:09.431]  Please listen.
[02:14:10.291 --> 02:14:18.932]   And We're gonna fill the whole planet up with InfoWars stickers again for the second time, but we need that InfoWars sticker pack.
[02:14:19.252 --> 02:14:25.112]   You sold them a few years ago and we did it during the 2016 election where you had like
[02:14:25.112 --> 02:14:26.112]  50 to 100 stickers.
[02:14:26.112 --> 02:14:29.011]   We'll gear up with a bunch of extra stickers and then we'll sell like 50 packs and 100
[02:14:29.011 --> 02:14:30.011]  packs at cost.
[02:14:30.011 --> 02:14:35.692]   And also did a deal where anybody that emailed us, I think we gave them 100 stickers or something,
[02:14:35.692 --> 02:14:37.971]  that was back when we had a little extra money.
[02:14:37.971 --> 02:14:40.131]  But that's definitely an effective way.
[02:14:40.131 --> 02:14:46.091]   And yes, the main way we get new people to tune in and wake up, which then is a chain
[02:14:46.091 --> 02:14:48.252]  reaction, is you doing it word of mouth.
[02:14:48.252 --> 02:14:50.731]  So that's beautiful and I really appreciate it.
[02:14:50.731 --> 02:14:52.731]  Michael, anything else?
[02:14:52.731 --> 02:14:53.731]  Yeah.
[02:14:53.731 --> 02:14:57.772]   And when people, when other InfoWars are handing out these stickers,
[02:14:58.393 --> 02:15:01.054]  Think about people who are like right on the verge of it.
[02:15:01.314 --> 02:15:04.495]  Like, people that are waking up that know something is going on.
[02:15:05.035 --> 02:15:08.376]  Like, go to your grocery store when they sell canning supplies.
[02:15:08.456 --> 02:15:09.856]  Slip one in the canning supplies.
[02:15:09.876 --> 02:15:10.396]  And it's that easy.
[02:15:10.416 --> 02:15:11.316]  Go to your gun store.
[02:15:11.396 --> 02:15:12.337]  Slip it in equipment.
[02:15:12.577 --> 02:15:12.897]  You know?
[02:15:12.917 --> 02:15:13.857]  Stuff like that.
[02:15:14.097 --> 02:15:21.539]  Just keep handing it out and keep questioning things and keep saying things to people so when they hear it, they're like, how did you know that?
[02:15:21.599 --> 02:15:22.719]  And then hand them the sticker.
[02:15:22.739 --> 02:15:26.080]  Because the quicker we wake everybody up, the quicker we can stop this.
[02:15:26.641 --> 02:15:39.495]  I agree, every order gets some stickers in it, but we need to do a sticker operation where we put like a hundred stickers in there at cost, and everybody that wants to take action gets it.
[02:15:39.515 --> 02:15:41.938]  We also have those little sheets that have a bunch of little stickers on them.
[02:15:42.478 --> 02:15:51.504]   Those are very, very, very effective, but the media, the virus, InfoWars.com, We've got hundreds of great stickers and they're all over the place and it really unifies people.
[02:15:51.564 --> 02:15:53.645]  It lets folks know other people are awake and you're right.
[02:15:53.965 --> 02:15:55.525]  It's a game of numbers.
[02:15:55.605 --> 02:15:58.926]  People are really waking up now with all the tyranny and you're right.
[02:15:59.286 --> 02:16:00.906]  The lockdowns are coming back.
[02:16:01.326 --> 02:16:02.207]  They admit they are.
[02:16:02.247 --> 02:16:03.027]  They're gearing them up.
[02:16:03.067 --> 02:16:06.668]  We got to keep pushing and exposing COVID and the culprits now.
[02:16:07.268 --> 02:16:08.408]  But that's a classic tactic.
[02:16:08.448 --> 02:16:09.268]  Attack, attack, attack.
[02:16:09.328 --> 02:16:10.669]  Back off so we go back to sleep.
[02:16:10.989 --> 02:16:11.989]  Then they're going to attack again.
[02:16:13.614 --> 02:16:17.396]  Also, Tom McDonald's new song, The System, you guys should play it.
[02:16:18.616 --> 02:16:24.399]  I saw yesterday, no not yesterday morning, Friday morning, I saw, was it this morning?
[02:16:25.079 --> 02:16:26.199]  It all blurs together.
[02:16:26.259 --> 02:16:27.840]  I saw Harrison Smith playing it.
[02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:29.101]  He's a great guy.
[02:16:30.021 --> 02:16:31.442]  I'd like to get him on the show.
[02:16:31.942 --> 02:16:42.026]  And all the big hit songs now, when I say all, a lot of the top hit songs now, both in hip-hop and in regular music and in rap and in rock and in country, are anti-New World Order.
[02:16:43.502 --> 02:16:47.624]  So, I'm not a big fan of the red eyes and the whole look, but hey, everybody can do what they want.
[02:16:49.124 --> 02:16:50.465]  But the music's definitely informative.
[02:16:51.005 --> 02:16:53.026]  Alright, thank you so much, I appreciate your call, Michael.
[02:16:54.586 --> 02:16:56.567]  It just scares the hell out of me to tattoo your eyes.
[02:16:56.867 --> 02:16:59.728]  Maybe he's wearing eye contacts or something, I don't know.
[02:16:59.748 --> 02:17:02.069]  But hey, it's contacts.
[02:17:02.509 --> 02:17:04.930]  Some people I know actually get their eyes tattooed, man.
[02:17:05.771 --> 02:17:06.631]  No thank you!
[02:17:07.847 --> 02:17:08.608]  No thank you.
[02:17:09.850 --> 02:17:13.114]  Alright, Trucker Josh, we're going to come back and talk to you in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:17:14.015 --> 02:17:15.537]  And by the way, I don't dislike tattoos.
[02:17:16.218 --> 02:17:20.904]  People that got them, that looks good on them, especially if you're in really good shape or whatever, they can look cool.
[02:17:22.927 --> 02:17:24.348]  I've just never drawn on my skin.
[02:17:24.388 --> 02:17:27.150]  It's got enough scars on it, though.
[02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:28.251]  That's kind of my style.
[02:17:28.271 --> 02:17:29.412]  A lot of scars on me.
[02:17:29.992 --> 02:17:30.312]  All right.
[02:17:30.393 --> 02:17:31.593]  Infowars.com.
[02:17:31.613 --> 02:17:32.834]  Ladies and gentlemen, the tip of the spear.
[02:17:33.295 --> 02:17:38.118]  Back in 60 seconds, finish up a call, then hand the baton mid-segment to the great Gerald Salente.
[02:17:38.759 --> 02:17:41.941]  My good friend, Gerald Salente, is about to take over here in just a few minutes.
[02:17:42.661 --> 02:17:44.843]  I have one other caller I'm going to hit and two more stories.
[02:17:45.664 --> 02:17:49.827]  Right now, let's go to Trucker John, who held patiently in Iowa.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:50.187]  Welcome.
[02:17:52.798 --> 02:17:54.059]  I'm great sir, go ahead.
[02:17:54.719 --> 02:17:55.500]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:58.041]  I'm pretty good, go ahead.
[02:17:58.081 --> 02:17:58.262]  Okay.
[02:17:58.842 --> 02:18:01.604]  Well, I'll just make this quick because I know you've got to get going.
[02:18:01.624 --> 02:18:12.130]  The point I wanted to make, and I know you've talked a lot about Karl Schwab and Bill Gates and the New World Order, and you know, obviously they play a huge part in all this.
[02:18:12.950 --> 02:18:28.943]   I guess a while back when I was a kid, my mom always stressed, you know, China owning up everything in this country and, you know, as a kid you don't really pay attention to it, you know, companies going out of business and this and that.
[02:18:29.884 --> 02:18:39.949]  But as an adult now looking at things and everything around us, I guess we can't check away from the focus that China is playing in all of this.
[02:18:40.990 --> 02:19:03.006]   I guess, you know, just from, you know, Joe Biden's comfort or, you know, the 10% for the big guy, One of the good things Trump did was go after the Chinese spies.
[02:19:03.046 --> 02:19:06.669]  Well, sir, when you say China's the heart of it, you're totally correct.
[02:19:06.749 --> 02:19:10.913]  It was the globalists in the 70s set up China, set up one-sided trade deals.
[02:19:11.313 --> 02:19:20.490]   So Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Herbert Walker Bush, Henry Kissinger, All of them set up China, and Charlie Munger brags about that.
[02:19:20.510 --> 02:19:28.239]  That's Bill Gates' lawyer, almost 100 years old, about how they set up China, and China's the model, and China's going to take over, and the CFR says that.
[02:19:28.259 --> 02:19:31.002]  So yes, globalist middlemen that Trump talked about.
[02:19:31.602 --> 02:19:44.926]  Worked with China and are allied against America with China, and they let China release the virus along with them and have the lockdowns and all that is highly coordinated, and most of the Democrats in Congress are literally double agents of the Chinese.
[02:19:45.226 --> 02:19:45.947]  You're totally right.
[02:19:45.967 --> 02:19:56.090]  Yeah, and a couple key things, like these mRNA vaccines, China never used them.
[02:19:56.772 --> 02:19:58.554]  That's right, it's a vile weapon against us.
[02:19:58.674 --> 02:20:00.235]  China and Russia are not using it.
[02:20:00.715 --> 02:20:01.216]  Great point.
[02:20:03.017 --> 02:20:06.700]  And I'll just make one other point quickly about cryptocurrency.
[02:20:07.401 --> 02:20:15.948]  I really think that people should think twice about it and kind of stay towards precious metals just because it's all based on use of the internet.
[02:20:15.988 --> 02:20:19.231]  Well, if we ever reach a point where there is no internet, there is no crypto.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:31.546]  Sure, for me it's just another option, and obviously it's going to go up and down, and it's way down right now, but I don't want a central government cryptocurrency that is a programmable token.
[02:20:31.626 --> 02:20:34.628]  I want free market, open, wide, diverse systems.
[02:20:34.668 --> 02:20:35.388]  Thank you so much.
[02:20:35.848 --> 02:20:36.769]  I really appreciate your points.
[02:20:36.809 --> 02:20:39.290]  But yes, gold and silver are a smart move, obviously.
[02:20:39.310 --> 02:20:42.352]  All right, here's a few final stories, and Gerald Celente takes over.
[02:20:43.593 --> 02:20:47.735]  George Soros, operative, appointed as Biden's Ministry of Truth co-chair.
[02:20:49.486 --> 02:20:55.629]  And the head of it is also a former Soros operative, who doesn't believe in free speech for conservatives.
[02:20:55.669 --> 02:20:58.551]  I mean, this is a censorship Ministry of Truth Board.
[02:20:59.071 --> 02:21:04.334]  Joe Biden's New Orwellian Disinformation Governments Board has appointed a radical Jordan Soros operative as its co-chair.
[02:21:04.894 --> 02:21:15.960]  Ministry of Truth's new principal deputy, Gerald Counsel Jennifer, General Counsel Jennifer Daskal, has deep ties to the Hungarian billionaire globalist.
[02:21:18.612 --> 02:21:30.536]  And the article goes into all the details of that, and then meanwhile, FDA chief claims misinformation is leading cause of death in the United States, questioning global warming, questioning the shots, questioning COVID.
[02:21:30.556 --> 02:21:32.896]  These people are desperate, and what are they saying?
[02:21:33.296 --> 02:21:41.659]  You being able to have free speech is the main cause of death, when it's these people with abortion and all the rest of it that are the main cause of death.
[02:21:41.699 --> 02:21:42.739]  They are our enemies.
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:44.360]  They are globalists.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.922]  A lot of other incredible footage and articles on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:48.343 --> 02:21:52.566]  Watch a white BLM activist tries to vote without an ID and then flips out about it.
[02:21:53.027 --> 02:21:55.669]  It just shows how out of control these people are.
[02:21:55.709 --> 02:21:57.430]  But the world is waking up!
[02:21:57.610 --> 02:21:57.951]  All right!
[02:21:59.249 --> 02:22:01.050]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[02:22:01.090 --> 02:22:03.151]  Central for the kickoff of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:03.471 --> 02:22:05.432]  Harrison Smith, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[02:22:05.472 --> 02:22:07.132]  American Journal does a fabulous job.
[02:22:07.152 --> 02:22:09.113]  A lot of great investing calls and breaking news.
[02:22:09.393 --> 02:22:11.514]  And Owen Schroer, not so out of the park, 3 p.m.
[02:22:11.554 --> 02:22:13.835]  Central every day with The War Room.
[02:22:14.055 --> 02:22:15.256]  And that's coming up in...
[02:22:16.818 --> 02:22:22.399]  49 minutes, but now, for the rest of the hour, the great Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com bookmarket.
[02:22:22.439 --> 02:22:24.220]  TrendsResearch.com takes over.
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:25.080]  Take it away, Gerald.
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:27.340]  Hey, thanks so much, Alex.
[02:22:27.380 --> 02:22:36.802]  Boy, you know, you nailed it with that FDA chief claims, quote, misinformation is leading cause of death in the United States.
[02:22:37.362 --> 02:22:44.484]  You know, if you go to our cover of the Trends Journal this week, you know, you misspelled misinformation.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:48.203]  Again, it's another great Anthony Frieda cover.
[02:22:48.803 --> 02:22:51.946]  And it's misinformation is M-I-S-S.
[02:22:52.627 --> 02:22:53.888]  Misinformation.
[02:22:54.408 --> 02:23:02.796]  Yeah, you read one of the hacks that they're putting up there is on that to make sure that we say only what they tell us to say.
[02:23:03.596 --> 02:23:10.583]  And then there's that other one over there that's going to be leading the charge that it's a freak show.
[02:23:11.023 --> 02:23:12.104]  Misinformation.
[02:23:13.144 --> 02:23:16.225]  And could you imagine you're not allowed to think for yourself.
[02:23:16.285 --> 02:23:17.625]  That's against the law now.
[02:23:18.365 --> 02:23:20.246]  How dare you not swallow.
[02:23:20.266 --> 02:23:21.446]  There we go.
[02:23:21.506 --> 02:23:22.546]  Misinformation.
[02:23:24.486 --> 02:23:25.547]  They'll tell you what to think.
[02:23:25.587 --> 02:23:26.287]  They know best.
[02:23:26.927 --> 02:23:28.627]  You're too stupid to think for yourself.
[02:23:28.667 --> 02:23:30.568]  Think for yourself is prohibited.
[02:23:31.028 --> 02:23:34.548]  Not allowed anymore in the U.S.S.A.
[02:23:35.449 --> 02:23:41.750]  And I was thinking about if you want to see how messed up this this country is.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:47.142]  This is a quote from the Daily Mail.
[02:23:48.722 --> 02:23:55.406]  Five Biden family members have been to rehab for drug addiction or alcohol abuse.
[02:23:56.826 --> 02:23:57.126]  Huh.
[02:23:59.067 --> 02:24:00.008]  Five members.
[02:24:01.929 --> 02:24:08.872]  So this guy has trouble raising his family and he's going to run the United States?
[02:24:10.953 --> 02:24:13.014]  You know, by their deeds you shall know them.
[02:24:13.687 --> 02:24:20.368]  Every day, every day, I thank my mother and father and all the aunts and uncles and the ancestors.
[02:24:20.848 --> 02:24:22.409]  May their souls rest in peace.
[02:24:23.089 --> 02:24:27.150]  Every day, I say, oh, thank you for all you've given me.
[02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:30.790]  I'm only me because of what you gave me.
[02:24:31.711 --> 02:24:38.152]  And I couldn't hold a candle to them, what they had to go through, you know, back in the day as immigrants.
[02:24:39.935 --> 02:24:41.756]  But you had an opportunity back then.
[02:24:41.796 --> 02:24:48.420]  But anyway, as I say, if your mother was a drug addict and you didn't know who your father was, you think you'd have a shot?
[02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:52.342]  Oh yeah, the government's education system will help you.
[02:24:52.642 --> 02:24:54.103]  You know, save it, you know?
[02:24:54.123 --> 02:24:57.045]  I'm only me because of where I came from.
[02:24:58.105 --> 02:25:06.570]  And so Biden's kids, again, by what they're saying, are only them from where they came from.
[02:25:07.864 --> 02:25:15.527]  So this guy, when you see is, you know, the coked out kid there, and how whacked out he is.
[02:25:16.388 --> 02:25:16.828]  Hunter.
[02:25:17.428 --> 02:25:18.629]  Always hunting for money.
[02:25:19.609 --> 02:25:30.154]  Again, getting the job with Burisma Energy in Ukraine, right after the United States overthrew the democratically elected government, the Viktor Yanukovych, back in 2014.
[02:25:29.993 --> 02:25:38.553]  in 2014. Him, Chris Hines from the Hines 57 family.
[02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:41.285]  And that was, uh, what's his name?
[02:25:41.345 --> 02:25:50.031]  Is there, uh, John Kerry, another boy, another arrogant little boy is his stepson.
[02:25:51.632 --> 02:25:56.836]  And another guy made all these millions of dollars with Boris managing.
[02:25:58.297 --> 02:25:59.899]  But again, this is who's leading us.
[02:26:00.199 --> 02:26:01.119]  It's a freak show.
[02:26:02.761 --> 02:26:04.342]  It's howdy duty time, you know?
[02:26:05.501 --> 02:26:06.801]  It's one freak after another.
[02:26:07.281 --> 02:26:14.763]  Yesterday, they had this Sunday, they had the big ceremony for the election of Macron, the little couture over there in France.
[02:26:15.963 --> 02:26:27.125]  And all these guys dressed up in the with that drag, you know, from way back when with those hats and all that stuff and saluting and rolling out the red carpet.
[02:26:28.025 --> 02:26:30.826]  It's a freak show right in front of your eyes.
[02:26:32.165 --> 02:26:35.206]  And the freaks are running the world and they're running us to death.
[02:26:35.686 --> 02:26:37.687]  Look at that clown Boris Johnson.
[02:26:38.887 --> 02:26:41.588]  Again, Anthony Fried is one of the best artists anywhere.
[02:26:42.048 --> 02:26:55.032]  I said to him, as great an artist as you are, if I told you make the biggest clown you ever could come up with and make him the Prime Minister of the UK, you couldn't do it.
[02:26:57.192 --> 02:26:59.553]  You couldn't match the clown that you got there now.
[02:27:01.383 --> 02:27:05.245]  So we have to unite for peace and freedom and justice.
[02:27:06.165 --> 02:27:08.487]  Because if we don't, it's going to be hell on earth.
[02:27:09.027 --> 02:27:13.409]  And you need to support InfoWars because misinformation is going to get you.
[02:27:14.470 --> 02:27:17.411]  Hey, everyone, thanks for having me on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:17.912 --> 02:27:20.133]  And you just saw misinformation over there.
[02:27:20.153 --> 02:27:22.294]  You know, this is again, it's a freak show.
[02:27:22.794 --> 02:27:26.356]  We got freaks running and ruining our lives right in front of your eyes.
[02:27:27.777 --> 02:27:30.358]  You know, and people tolerate it.
[02:27:31.894 --> 02:27:39.099]  And that's why you have to support InfoWars, because we are on the cusp of World War III.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.441]  You know, I keep thinking about this.
[02:27:41.641 --> 02:27:44.603]  I say the 20th century was the American century.
[02:27:45.424 --> 02:27:48.886]  Unfortunately, the 21st century is going to be the Chinese century.
[02:27:50.427 --> 02:27:57.212]  And one of the main reasons is the business of China is business, and the business of America has been war.
[02:27:58.863 --> 02:28:01.165]  And that's all they're talking about now is war.
[02:28:01.225 --> 02:28:02.866]  So let's look at the equity markets.
[02:28:04.247 --> 02:28:06.269]  Look how they've been in a down spin.
[02:28:07.029 --> 02:28:10.692]  Today they were down over 500 points, now they're down 300 and something points.
[02:28:11.493 --> 02:28:12.794]  Last week was a freak show.
[02:28:14.455 --> 02:28:14.755]  And why?
[02:28:14.775 --> 02:28:19.719]  Because they're going to raise interest rates just a little bit when we have inflation skyrocketing at 8.5%.
[02:28:19.759 --> 02:28:24.403]  Even a 75% basis point interest rate is nothing.
[02:28:28.151 --> 02:28:31.272]  When you have an 8.5% inflation rate.
[02:28:32.212 --> 02:28:44.594]  And according to the IMF, the international mafia, a monetary fund, they say that you have to have interest rates one percentage point above the inflation rate to bring down inflation.
[02:28:46.614 --> 02:28:57.656]  So you're looking now, gold taking a hit, Bitcoin, oil, silver, copper.
[02:28:59.773 --> 02:29:01.214]  So it's saying two things.
[02:29:03.555 --> 02:29:12.179]  Number one, it's not stagflation, where it's a stagnant economy and increasing inflation.
[02:29:13.219 --> 02:29:14.580]  It's dragflation.
[02:29:15.440 --> 02:29:20.903]  It's a dragging down economy and rising inflation.
[02:29:22.023 --> 02:29:24.724]  The dollar now is like at a 20 year high.
[02:29:25.985 --> 02:29:26.205]  Right?
[02:29:27.202 --> 02:29:31.003]  With a $30 trillion debt, keep pumping in all this cheap money.
[02:29:31.584 --> 02:29:33.364]  Why is the dollar doing so good?
[02:29:33.864 --> 02:29:34.945]  Who's the competition?
[02:29:34.965 --> 02:29:38.466]  There's no competition.
[02:29:39.566 --> 02:29:40.887]  China is in lockdown.
[02:29:42.147 --> 02:29:43.868]  And we became the Chinese way.
[02:29:45.528 --> 02:29:47.409]  They're the ones that launched the COVID war.
[02:29:48.769 --> 02:29:49.650]  Italy followed.
[02:29:50.770 --> 02:29:53.691]  And the rest of the world marched to their orders.
[02:29:54.491 --> 02:29:55.932]  And now they're locking down again.
[02:29:57.307 --> 02:29:59.108]  And that's just bringing oil prices down.
[02:30:00.068 --> 02:30:03.589]  That's just bringing profits down in so many of these countries to go to China.
[02:30:03.609 --> 02:30:07.350]  You know, what does America have, 332 million people?
[02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:11.872]  And China only has what, 1.4 billion?
[02:30:13.012 --> 02:30:18.674]  China's locked down as many people as America has as a country.
[02:30:20.177 --> 02:30:31.726]  So your Gucci's, and your Coca-Cola's, and your Nike's, and all them companies over there that are making all that dough by selling the stuff to the Chinese, they're not making it now.
[02:30:34.989 --> 02:30:39.692]  So the lunacy, you know, is beyond the reality.
[02:30:40.933 --> 02:30:46.578]  And again, you go to the Infowars site, and it had an article up there about Sweden.
[02:30:48.018 --> 02:30:51.861]  About how Sweden didn't lock down as the other European nations did.
[02:30:53.262 --> 02:30:56.164]  And their COVID death rate is far below.
[02:30:56.785 --> 02:30:57.885]  Spain and Italy.
[02:30:58.166 --> 02:31:00.367]  Italy was the first to be locked down.
[02:31:01.648 --> 02:31:04.110]  Again, as an Italian, I'm ashamed of the Italians.
[02:31:04.630 --> 02:31:05.471]  I stopped going there in 2015.
[02:31:05.531 --> 02:31:08.913]  I went with my cousin Vinny.
[02:31:08.933 --> 02:31:09.914]  I had a cousin Vinny.
[02:31:11.155 --> 02:31:15.638]  And we went over to the World's Fair in Milan.
[02:31:17.173 --> 02:31:20.514]  It brought to you by Coca-Cola and McDonald's.
[02:31:20.574 --> 02:31:21.295]  I was heartbroken.
[02:31:22.415 --> 02:31:23.055]  It was terrible.
[02:31:23.936 --> 02:31:30.098]  And the New York one, the American thing was like going to a, to a diner, you know, it was just nothing.
[02:31:30.699 --> 02:31:32.639]  The food, it was a disgrace.
[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:36.641]  But anyway, I got Italian friends there and I complained.
[02:31:37.101 --> 02:31:38.302]  I can't cut down a tree.
[02:31:38.382 --> 02:31:40.163]  I can't paint my house the color I want.
[02:31:40.203 --> 02:31:40.863]  I can't do this.
[02:31:40.943 --> 02:31:41.563]  I can't do that.
[02:31:41.903 --> 02:31:43.324]  The bureaucracy is so bad.
[02:31:45.211 --> 02:31:47.673]  And I say to him, I said, what are you going to do about it?
[02:31:48.574 --> 02:31:49.474]  What are we going to do?
[02:31:49.854 --> 02:31:50.955]  What are we going to do?
[02:31:50.975 --> 02:31:51.656]  I lost my heart.
[02:31:52.376 --> 02:31:53.998]  One time, the Italians used to be fighters.
[02:31:54.018 --> 02:31:54.218]  No more.
[02:31:54.298 --> 02:32:01.083]  And they let a clown, a guy, Matteo, before Draghi, the bank's that it's in there.
[02:32:01.443 --> 02:32:02.324]  Locking down the place.
[02:32:02.784 --> 02:32:05.266]  Got a much higher death rate than Sweden.
[02:32:06.547 --> 02:32:13.532]  And again, it all goes back to what we're talking about and knowing about the facts rather than misinformation.
[02:32:14.272 --> 02:32:15.273]  Misinformation.
[02:32:19.096 --> 02:32:27.382]  And the facts are this economy and the global economy is going down big, hard and heavy.
[02:32:29.504 --> 02:32:32.366]  And the sanctions have made a bad situation worse.
[02:32:34.388 --> 02:32:39.112]  Again, even out of the mouth of Biden, BS Biden.
[02:32:41.113 --> 02:32:42.734]  So this won't deter Putin.
[02:32:42.754 --> 02:32:43.435]  Then why are you doing it?
[02:32:45.768 --> 02:32:46.969]  Well, because I'm a maniac.
[02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:49.170]  All right?
[02:32:51.091 --> 02:32:51.292]  Yep.
[02:32:52.032 --> 02:32:59.557]  Sweden suffered fewer debts per capita than much of Europe, despite refusing to enforce strict lockdowns.
[02:32:59.897 --> 02:33:05.441]  Again, we wrote about this in the Trends Journal continually, as it was happening, and how they made fun of Sweden.
[02:33:06.261 --> 02:33:07.862]  We got freaks.
[02:33:07.882 --> 02:33:09.103]  I got businesses dead.
[02:33:10.204 --> 02:33:11.765]  Businesses have been wiped out.
[02:33:12.802 --> 02:33:16.204]  The damage that the COVID war has done is beyond the belief.
[02:33:18.005 --> 02:33:20.767]  And they're not going to tell you in the in the prostitute media.
[02:33:21.448 --> 02:33:24.730]  And again, that's why you need to support Infowars.
[02:33:26.731 --> 02:33:29.013]  The truth is hard to find anymore.
[02:33:29.973 --> 02:33:31.895]  It's the same with us, the truth in trends.
[02:33:31.935 --> 02:33:35.497]  We tell you what it is, what we see, and then the motto is think for yourself.
[02:33:36.738 --> 02:33:41.501]  But we don't give you a one-sided story, like the media is doing with the Ukraine war.
[02:33:42.185 --> 02:33:44.287]  And when we get back, we're going to talk more about that.
[02:33:45.107 --> 02:33:51.292]  But in the meantime, you got you have Bitcoin right now at a very serious point.
[02:33:52.253 --> 02:33:53.594]  And we have the breakout point.
[02:33:54.074 --> 02:34:02.461]  If it goes below this number, and we've been saying this now for almost two years, it's going to dive back very deeply.
[02:34:03.802 --> 02:34:09.446]  And on gold, I got to tell you, I wouldn't have thought gold would go down as low as it is right now.
[02:34:10.166 --> 02:34:14.158]   But to me, Gold is still the number one safe haven asset.
[02:34:14.358 --> 02:34:16.279]  Again, we don't give financial advice.
[02:34:17.019 --> 02:34:18.159]  And silver number two.
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:21.881]  And when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:34:23.201 --> 02:34:26.682]  And the economy is failing, and they're taking us to war.
[02:34:28.103 --> 02:34:29.523]  It's not a proxy war.
[02:34:30.363 --> 02:34:35.045]  If I give guns to a killer, I'm an accessory to the crime.
[02:34:36.465 --> 02:34:39.867]   And America's accessories To the Ukraine war.
[02:34:40.167 --> 02:34:41.648]  And Ukraine's not my trip.
[02:34:41.728 --> 02:34:42.548]  I'm an American.
[02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:45.750]  Ask most Americans to find Ukraine on the map.
[02:34:46.290 --> 02:34:47.891]  They'd probably go down to Mexico.
[02:34:49.452 --> 02:34:50.353]  What are we fighting over?
[02:34:50.373 --> 02:34:52.654]  We've been going off for hundreds of years between these two.
[02:34:52.674 --> 02:34:53.655]  It's not my war.
[02:34:54.515 --> 02:34:56.796]  It's the war of the military-industrial complex.
[02:34:56.816 --> 02:34:57.857]  That's whose war it is.
[02:34:58.818 --> 02:35:01.479]  The war that General Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us about.
[02:35:01.499 --> 02:35:04.421]  And it's only going to continue to get worse.
[02:35:06.203 --> 02:35:10.225]  You got this guy, this Chancellor over there in Germany, Schultz.
[02:35:11.686 --> 02:35:14.908]  Ukraine will not accept the war and neither will we.
[02:35:16.189 --> 02:35:16.369]  Yep.
[02:35:17.710 --> 02:35:18.790]  Ukraine will prevail.
[02:35:18.810 --> 02:35:19.791]  Want to bet?
[02:35:20.751 --> 02:35:21.252]  Want to bet?
[02:35:22.172 --> 02:35:27.675]  Our Trends poll on Twitter, 76% say Russia's going to win.
[02:35:28.556 --> 02:35:32.738]  Oh, and Little True Dope up there in Canada, he says Ukraine will win too.
[02:35:33.279 --> 02:35:33.779]  We'll be back.
[02:35:34.668 --> 02:35:36.769]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:36.809 --> 02:35:40.031]  And as he says, you know, it's tomorrow's news today.
[02:35:40.051 --> 02:35:48.977]  And it's really important because, again, as the cover of the Trends Journal shows, misinformation is in charge.
[02:35:49.758 --> 02:35:53.340]  And they'll tell us what to think, what to do, and what we should do.
[02:35:54.241 --> 02:36:01.125]  You know, they have this one day flash sale now because you have to do everything you can to keep the truth alive here.
[02:36:01.983 --> 02:36:04.285]  And Alex Jones and the team are doing it.
[02:36:04.805 --> 02:36:06.747]  And they have knockout sleep support.
[02:36:07.348 --> 02:36:08.689]  It's 40% off.
[02:36:09.269 --> 02:36:10.450]  And the research is clear.
[02:36:10.490 --> 02:36:11.671]  You see it all over the place.
[02:36:11.731 --> 02:36:13.833]  Millions of people around the world, they can't sleep.
[02:36:13.853 --> 02:36:15.474]  They're having trouble every night.
[02:36:16.035 --> 02:36:20.999]  And the negative health effects of not sleeping, you know, they're not good for you.
[02:36:21.379 --> 02:36:22.220]  They're staggering.
[02:36:22.680 --> 02:36:28.885]  And that's why InfoWars is launching their limited time flash sale on knockout sleep support.
[02:36:29.557 --> 02:36:36.739]  And Knockout Sleep Support's a natural sleep support formula that incorporates the most powerful ingredients.
[02:36:37.259 --> 02:36:40.841]  And again, it's available now for 40% off.
[02:36:41.201 --> 02:36:45.222]  And they have eight natural ingredients in there that aid restful deep sleep.
[02:36:45.262 --> 02:36:47.443]  And again, people are having a real problem with this.
[02:36:47.943 --> 02:36:57.606]  They got the valerian root, melatonin, lemon balm, gaba, chamomile flower extract, a whole load of stuff.
[02:36:59.039 --> 02:37:00.360]  Hops flower extract.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:10.688]  So shop knockout at 40% off to save big on this powerful product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:10.728 --> 02:37:13.790]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:14.791 --> 02:37:22.037]  And again, you're not only supporting InfoWars, get this in your head, you're supporting yourself.
[02:37:23.097 --> 02:37:25.019]  So it's not a free trip.
[02:37:26.719 --> 02:37:37.187]  And we have to do everything we can to support InfoWars because again, it's all, it's about one side misinformation.
[02:37:38.248 --> 02:37:50.217]  As I mentioned, that little guy Trudeau over there in Canada went to Ukraine and he condemned the unprovoked military invasion.
[02:37:50.858 --> 02:37:51.939]  It wasn't unprovoked.
[02:37:51.979 --> 02:37:54.721]  Again, we were writing about this in the Trends Journal.
[02:37:55.390 --> 02:38:25.138]   Going back to, let's see, December 2014, how the United States Over through the democratically elected government of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, because he wanted to do a deal with Putin after breaking a possible deal with the IMF and the EU to borrow money because Ukraine has been in the toilet since they broke up from the Soviet Union financially.
[02:38:25.618 --> 02:38:28.179]  And again, you know, the facts are all there.
[02:38:28.699 --> 02:38:30.600]  We've been writing about this for years here.
[02:38:30.620 --> 02:38:35.022]  This is an article from the Trends Journal in April.
[02:38:36.035 --> 02:38:36.455]  30th, 2014.
[02:38:36.535 --> 02:38:40.678]  No need for NATO.
[02:38:41.479 --> 02:38:43.000]  NATO has gone on too long.
[02:38:43.100 --> 02:38:54.007]  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established on April 4th, 1949, as a defense alliance whose purpose was to defend Western Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion.
[02:38:54.808 --> 02:39:02.613]  As NATO's first Secretary General put it, NATO was formed in order to keep Russians out of Western Europe and the Americans in.
[02:39:03.353 --> 02:39:10.538]   Instead of disbanding, NATO, when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Washington dramatically expanded NATO.
[02:39:11.118 --> 02:39:22.101]  In violation of the Reagan-Gorbachev agreement, the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush regimes added constituent parts of the former Soviet Empire to NATO.
[02:39:22.501 --> 02:39:28.103]  Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania.
[02:39:28.123 --> 02:39:29.583]  Remember, this is 2014.
[02:39:31.783 --> 02:39:33.984]  France, taken out of NATO by General de Gaulle.
[02:39:34.506 --> 02:39:43.170]  We joined in April 2009, 18 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, along with Croatia and Albania.
[02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:49.332]  Currently, the Obama regime is working to incorporate into NATO two former Soviet republics.
[02:39:49.512 --> 02:39:49.853]  You ready?
[02:39:51.393 --> 02:39:53.394]  Ukraine and Georgia.
[02:39:53.213 --> 02:40:03.414]  2014 we wrote about this.
[02:40:03.414 --> 02:40:06.494]  And Trudeau talking about the images are horrific.
[02:40:06.475 --> 02:40:11.017]  Every day they're showing these horrific images in the TV and in the papers.
[02:40:11.077 --> 02:40:20.500]  But they weren't showing, hey Trudeau, hey you little arrogant boy, you little arrogant boy, you want to go shoulder to shoulder with them?
[02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:25.822]  Go over there and fight or shut your fat daddy's mouth.
[02:40:26.122 --> 02:40:27.302]  You're a nobody.
[02:40:27.642 --> 02:40:29.703]  You're a little nothing of a clown.
[02:40:30.603 --> 02:40:37.488]  You'd be nobody if Daddy wasn't Justin Trudeau, and you're just a piece of Trudeau.
[02:40:40.209 --> 02:40:41.670]  It's none of our business.
[02:40:42.811 --> 02:40:46.754]  Go fight, little boy, or shut your fat mouth.
[02:40:47.154 --> 02:40:56.740]  And I want to make this clear to everybody out there, including Joe Biden, who calls himself a Catholic.
[02:40:58.101 --> 02:40:59.442]  I was raised Catholic.
[02:41:01.061 --> 02:41:16.106]  The Jesus Christ that I was taught to obey and listen to would be telling you, you keep it up, you're going to hell.
[02:41:17.487 --> 02:41:42.036]   Because Jesus Christ would not go take a trip to Alabama at Lockheed Martin, the biggest defense contractor In the United States and probably the world and brag about getting more lethal weapons to go kill people over there in Ukraine.
[02:41:43.557 --> 02:41:45.497]  Where are all you Catholics?
[02:41:46.998 --> 02:41:49.059]  What Christ do you believe in?
[02:41:50.139 --> 02:41:52.220]  Your Christ is a demon.
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.641]  It's not Jesus Christ.
[02:41:56.841 --> 02:42:02.369]   And again, I founded The Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice.
[02:42:02.889 --> 02:42:10.515]  And little Trudeau over there, yesterday, was talking about bringing freedom, peace and justice to Canada.
[02:42:11.476 --> 02:42:11.696]  Yep.
[02:42:13.958 --> 02:42:15.399]  The images are horrific.
[02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:17.241]  Hey, fat mouth!
[02:42:17.601 --> 02:42:20.944]  How about the images of America destroying Syria?
[02:42:21.604 --> 02:42:24.206]  How about the... Oh, in Canada!
[02:42:24.506 --> 02:42:25.927]  Canada was there too!
[02:42:26.188 --> 02:42:27.469]  With the cannons away!
[02:42:27.929 --> 02:42:29.971]  Slaughtering people, fat mouth!
[02:42:31.432 --> 02:42:33.974]  How about Afghanistan?
[02:42:34.254 --> 02:42:36.015]  Oh, maybe you can't spell that word!
[02:42:36.296 --> 02:42:37.497]  We'll give it just Afghan.
[02:42:38.237 --> 02:42:39.138]  How about Iraq?
[02:42:39.438 --> 02:42:41.120]  All the people you murdered over there!
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:42.761]  Fat mouth, true dope!
[02:42:44.477 --> 02:42:45.458]  No, no, no.
[02:42:45.558 --> 02:42:48.419]  Libya, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq.
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:50.020]  Oh, they were fine!
[02:42:50.341 --> 02:42:52.722]  We brought freedom and democracy!
[02:42:53.161 --> 02:42:55.161]  Yeah, democracy!
[02:42:55.161 --> 02:43:01.600]  One after another.
[02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:11.601]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:43:02.788 --> 02:43:03.348]  Ready for this?
[02:43:04.369 --> 02:43:07.191]  Russia's war in Ukraine has backfired.
[02:43:07.911 --> 02:43:12.474]  David Petraeus tells DW.
[02:43:13.459 --> 02:43:22.790]  Mr. German News, the retired Army General said, rather than advancing Russia's cause, the war in Ukraine was making NATO stronger.
[02:43:22.870 --> 02:43:23.370]  Great!
[02:43:23.831 --> 02:43:24.351]  Great!
[02:43:25.112 --> 02:43:32.721]  He praised extraordinary steps taken by Germany on weapons exports to kill more people.
[02:43:33.459 --> 02:43:35.180]  And more military spending.
[02:43:35.561 --> 02:43:37.602]  Why would anybody betray us?
[02:43:38.123 --> 02:43:39.864]  How about betrayed us?
[02:43:40.665 --> 02:43:42.646]  This is another arrogant guy.
[02:43:42.666 --> 02:43:43.767]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:50.632]  We're making progress, he said back in June 2011 with the Afghan war.
[02:43:50.712 --> 02:43:51.673]  Making progress?
[02:43:52.494 --> 02:43:52.814]  Yeah.
[02:43:54.315 --> 02:43:59.319]  We're really loathe to use this very loaded term of winning or losing.
[02:44:00.171 --> 02:44:05.654]  We've made enormous progress in a number of different geographic areas within Afghanistan.
[02:44:06.334 --> 02:44:08.635]  And overall, the momentum has changed.
[02:44:08.995 --> 02:44:10.896]  And you're gonna believe this guy?
[02:44:10.916 --> 02:44:14.058]  Hey, betrayed us, haven't won a war.
[02:44:14.618 --> 02:44:25.864]  Oh, oh, oh, and he got, you know, he was a CIA guy, you know, but he got thrown out there for a while.
[02:44:26.789 --> 02:44:30.611]  We reside in disgrace because of an extramarital affair.
[02:44:31.931 --> 02:44:32.972]  That was a Buddha gig?
[02:44:34.032 --> 02:44:35.993]  Because, hey, you know, never know.
[02:44:36.934 --> 02:44:40.035]  Because, Petraeus, you're not a man!
[02:44:40.055 --> 02:44:42.416]  You are a murderer!
[02:44:42.796 --> 02:44:44.377]  You love murder!
[02:44:44.397 --> 02:44:47.618]  Where are all you Christians?
[02:44:48.839 --> 02:44:50.220]  Where are all the Jews?
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:52.761]  Islamists!
[02:44:53.441 --> 02:44:58.064]  Why are you standing up for peace, rather than sending more weapons to death?
[02:44:58.084 --> 02:45:00.806]  I know why.
[02:45:01.887 --> 02:45:06.369]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and again, you know, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:18.117]  And my, you know, again, my motto of the Trends Journal magazine, think for yourself, but I tell you what I love, one of the great products are those little gold bars they got over there.
[02:45:18.757 --> 02:45:23.508]   Boy, they're To me, gold is the ultimate safe haven asset.
[02:45:24.049 --> 02:45:30.533]  My first buy of gold was when I was a youngster, back in 1970s.
[02:45:30.813 --> 02:45:32.194]  My first buy was $187.50 an ounce.
[02:45:32.495 --> 02:45:37.178]  Now it's floating around $1,860.
[02:45:37.218 --> 02:45:43.302]  And the markets, they're down over 600 points when I just got back on the air over here.
[02:45:43.942 --> 02:46:01.728]   And you take a look over there in Europe, the The euro markets were down almost 3% today and the Nikkei index down almost 3%, 2.5 and the Hang Seng over there really sunk it down almost 4%.
[02:46:01.788 --> 02:46:05.270]  So we're going through very, very difficult times.
[02:46:05.970 --> 02:46:13.073]  And again, to me, safe haven assets are the number one and those gold bars to me are golden.
[02:46:15.566 --> 02:46:22.030]  That guy betrayed us, by the way, that arrogant, arrogant clown that the mainstream media quotes.
[02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:23.151]  All right.
[02:46:23.751 --> 02:46:28.374]  This is, this is, this is from him back in June of 2011.
[02:46:33.256 --> 02:46:38.359]  Petraeus wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine, ready?
[02:46:39.420 --> 02:46:40.721]  How we wanted Iraq.
[02:46:45.721 --> 02:46:48.462]  And they listen to these clowns!
[02:46:49.223 --> 02:46:52.424]  And that's why you have to tune into Infowars.
[02:46:52.664 --> 02:46:59.368]  And if you want to know the trends that are going on, what in the world is going on, what it means and what's next, you want the Trends Journal.
[02:46:59.788 --> 02:47:05.071]  Because if you listen to these clowns on the prestitute mainstream media, you get nowhere.
[02:47:05.091 --> 02:47:05.531]  There we go.
[02:47:05.551 --> 02:47:06.991]  How we won in Iraq.
[02:47:07.052 --> 02:47:07.812]  Not making it up.
[02:47:08.436 --> 02:47:11.177]  And they quote this guy, General.
[02:47:11.417 --> 02:47:14.839]  Yeah, I love these guys with all these little things on their chest.
[02:47:14.879 --> 02:47:16.499]  Yes, take it easy, man.
[02:47:16.979 --> 02:47:17.960]  Take it easy.
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:20.241]  You know, I'm not in the Boy Scouts.
[02:47:23.942 --> 02:47:27.824]  Again, you look at that picture yesterday of that little Macron over there in France and all those guys dressed up.
[02:47:27.844 --> 02:47:38.700]   Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew Putin calls out US.
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:40.081]  This is one of our article.
[02:47:40.101 --> 02:47:41.402]  Yeah, we got mission accomplished.
[02:47:41.903 --> 02:47:43.424]  Another daddy's boy.
[02:47:43.824 --> 02:47:45.606]  Another little boy of nothing.
[02:47:46.306 --> 02:47:47.587]  Another little clown.
[02:47:47.787 --> 02:47:49.729]  A daddy's boy.
[02:47:50.689 --> 02:47:53.071]  And people believe them.
[02:47:53.091 --> 02:47:55.753]  88% of the people believe that stupid jerk.
[02:47:56.074 --> 02:47:57.735]  We're gonna get Osama Bin Laden.
[02:47:58.255 --> 02:47:59.296]  Get him alive.
[02:48:00.557 --> 02:48:02.138]  He say try to kill my daddy.
[02:48:02.158 --> 02:48:04.100]  I'm gonna go try to kill him.
[02:48:06.462 --> 02:48:06.842]  All right.
[02:48:09.810 --> 02:48:13.712]  So, one of the articles is going to be in tomorrow's Trends Journal.
[02:48:13.752 --> 02:48:18.475]  Putin calls out US and NATO, blames them for Ukraine war.
[02:48:19.216 --> 02:48:26.460]  So today is that, you know, victory day in Russia.
[02:48:28.181 --> 02:48:32.203]  And it's the anniversary of the Allied victory.
[02:48:33.384 --> 02:48:54.448]   And in their victory parade today, Putin said, We saw how the military infrastructure was unfolding, how hundreds of foreign advisors had begun to work there, meaning Ukraine, with the most modern weapons being regularly delivered from NATO countries.
[02:48:56.209 --> 02:48:58.130]  The danger was growing every day.
[02:48:59.411 --> 02:49:02.932]  Russia offered a preemptive rebuff to the aggression.
[02:49:04.493 --> 02:49:19.688]   This was a forced, timely move and the only correct decision Once taken by a strong and independent country, he called the invasion a preemptive strike to demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.
[02:49:22.209 --> 02:49:34.418]  Putin said intelligence revealed that preparations were underway for another, quote, punitive operation in the Donbass, an invasion of our historical lands, including Crimea, and that U.S.
[02:49:34.458 --> 02:49:41.256]   NATO and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ignored Moscow's claims And refused to discuss them.
[02:49:43.118 --> 02:49:46.261]  NATO countries, quote, didn't want to hear us.
[02:49:47.142 --> 02:49:52.767]  Which means that, in fact, they harbored completely different plans and we saw it.
[02:49:55.530 --> 02:50:00.615]  Brazil's ex-president Lula, Zelensky wanted war with Russia.
[02:50:01.676 --> 02:50:04.098]  West encouraging conflict in Ukraine.
[02:50:05.293 --> 02:50:09.174]  This is Lula who's running against Bolsonaro in Brazil.
[02:50:09.634 --> 02:50:15.135]  They call this guy a left of left of left kind of guy.
[02:50:16.835 --> 02:50:26.337]  Time Magazine did an article where Lula is blaming the Americans, NATO, and Zelensky.
[02:50:29.058 --> 02:50:29.458]  All right?
[02:50:30.678 --> 02:50:32.519]  They're egging Russia into this.
[02:50:33.399 --> 02:50:37.459]   But Not a word in the prostitute media.
[02:50:38.099 --> 02:50:49.407]  And that's why you subscribe to the Trends Journal and listen to InfoWars because we're telling you what's going on, what it means and what's next.
[02:50:50.908 --> 02:51:01.355]  This is the only headline that I saw before I got on the air to talk about the Victory Parade speech by Putin today in Russia.
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:14.244]  And by the way, the Germans in Operation Barbarossa killed an estimated 25 million Russians in World War II.
[02:51:14.544 --> 02:51:16.025]  And they were the first ones to beat Germany.
[02:51:16.565 --> 02:51:18.366]  So you think that Ukraine's going to beat them?
[02:51:19.026 --> 02:51:21.487]  Anyway, Yahoo Business Insider.
[02:51:22.547 --> 02:51:31.651]  Hackers replaced Russian TV schedule during Putin's Victory Day parade with anti-war messages saying the blood of Ukraine's is on Russian hands.
[02:51:32.389 --> 02:51:38.811]  That's what they, not a word about what Putin's saying, doesn't make any difference in the mainstream media.
[02:51:39.451 --> 02:51:48.973]  And again, Lula said, this is from Time Magazine, about Zelensky, he did want war.
[02:51:49.994 --> 02:51:54.995]  If he didn't want war, he would have negotiated a little more.
[02:51:55.755 --> 02:52:07.750]   And then Lula goes on to say, What I've been saying, and I said earlier, nobody is trying
[02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:09.069]  to create peace.
[02:52:09.069 --> 02:52:19.308]   He also noted that people are inciting hatred toward Russians
[02:52:19.308 --> 02:52:26.510]   and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but that won't solve anything.
[02:52:26.756 --> 02:52:29.997]  Quote, we really need to reach an agreement.
[02:52:30.745 --> 02:52:32.946]  But people are encouraging war.
[02:52:34.406 --> 02:52:37.107]  You are encouraging this guy, Zelensky.
[02:52:37.127 --> 02:52:38.628]  You ready?
[02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:42.409]  And he thinks he is a cherry on the cake.
[02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:46.831]  We should have a serious conversation.
[02:52:47.651 --> 02:52:50.272]  Okay, you are a nice comedian.
[02:52:52.233 --> 02:52:56.915]  But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.
[02:53:01.502 --> 02:53:03.884]  And he goes on to say what a clown show it is.
[02:53:03.924 --> 02:53:11.589]  He sees Zelensky playing his role on all the TVs all over the world and everybody getting up and applauding him.
[02:53:11.649 --> 02:53:12.570]  The guy's a comedian.
[02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:14.791]  You can't make this crap up.
[02:53:16.493 --> 02:53:24.518]  A guy that played the comedian on TV in Ukraine becomes the president, played the president of Ukraine as a comedian.
[02:53:24.838 --> 02:53:27.861]  He's now the president of Ukraine and he's still a comedian.
[02:53:29.982 --> 02:53:45.809]   No one's, this is, With the United States, and again, I'm going to make this really clear, don't call yourself a Christian if you believe in Jesus Christ, because Jesus Christ would not be recommending sending more lethal weapons to kill people.
[02:53:46.769 --> 02:53:48.289]  Ukraine is going to lose the war.
[02:53:49.830 --> 02:53:56.851]  The longer they keep it going, the more people that are going to be killed, and the more destruction that's going to happen.
[02:53:57.995 --> 02:54:07.742]  And for anybody to listen to American intelligence, which is an oxymoron, because that's all they are, there's no intelli... He told us about 9-11 before it happened, didn't he?
[02:54:07.762 --> 02:54:09.083]  Oh, don't go do... Nah.
[02:54:10.344 --> 02:54:18.769]  Or listen to ex-generals like Betrayed Us, or Lloyd Austin, our Defense Department head.
[02:54:19.110 --> 02:54:20.130]  Where did he just come from?
[02:54:20.631 --> 02:54:25.454]  Oh, the Board of Directors of Raytheon, the second military industrial contractor in the United States?
[02:54:26.351 --> 02:54:35.593]  If you're dumb enough to listen to them, dumb enough to believe Bush, dumb enough to believe Obama, dumb enough to believe Biden.
[02:54:38.794 --> 02:54:39.014]  Yep.
[02:54:41.074 --> 02:54:42.395]  One freak after another.
[02:54:44.215 --> 02:54:44.955]  We need peace.
[02:54:45.035 --> 02:54:46.756]  I'm totally against what Russia's done.
[02:54:47.396 --> 02:54:48.256]  Totally against it.
[02:54:49.737 --> 02:54:53.357]  And I'm totally against sending my money to go kill people.
[02:54:54.138 --> 02:54:55.998]  I am not an accessory to the crime.
[02:54:57.552 --> 02:55:00.735]  And then again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:55:01.536 --> 02:55:02.798]  It's a very critical time.
[02:55:03.639 --> 02:55:08.384]  They're trying to take InfoWars down and give us more misinformation.
[02:55:10.885 --> 02:55:21.525]  See you next week.
[02:55:22.245 --> 02:55:27.330]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:55:28.371 --> 02:55:29.672]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:55:30.673 --> 02:55:40.823]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word of mouth, and shopping with us, and supporting us, while at the same time getting great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:42.153 --> 02:56:00.644]  But now because of supply chain breakdowns and now because of all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits and the slanted nature of those attacks, we are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America is pushed up against a wall.
[02:56:00.965 --> 02:56:05.748]  And we're being bullied, we're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us.
[02:56:06.820 --> 02:56:07.861]  To be able to get to you.
[02:56:07.941 --> 02:56:16.728]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers and ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:56:17.669 --> 02:56:18.710]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:56:18.850 --> 02:56:45.369]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com, where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:54.436]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:56:54.716 --> 02:56:58.399]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:56:58.659 --> 02:57:14.214]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand, this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like Infowars.
[02:57:14.674 --> 02:57:22.197]  Think of the millions of people that learned about Ivermectin and Zinc and Vitamin D and Hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:57:22.577 --> 02:57:26.959]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:57:27.739 --> 02:57:32.683]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:57:33.443 --> 02:57:35.985]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:57:36.085 --> 02:57:41.269]  Think about our 9-11 in Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalists and the occult.
[02:57:41.569 --> 02:57:49.195]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:57:49.815 --> 02:57:54.879]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine Infowars not being there.
[02:57:55.868 --> 02:58:06.252]  So I want to ask you to go to infowarestore.com and every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well where you can donate and we can buy products.
[02:58:06.332 --> 02:58:16.956]  And again, all the t-shirts, all the apparel, all the ball caps, all the flags, some of it going back, some of the stuff's been in the warehouse five years, over a hundred designs, great shirts, great ball caps, you name it.
[02:58:16.976 --> 02:58:18.217]  We're selling it all at cost.
[02:58:18.617 --> 02:58:23.139]  In the future, we're just going to have limited edition shirts for a limited time, only a few designs at a time.
[02:58:24.480 --> 02:58:27.101]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:58:27.141 --> 02:58:27.922]  We just can't do it.
[02:58:28.362 --> 02:58:29.743]  So, one-of-a-kind shirts.
[02:58:29.763 --> 02:58:30.883]  Get them at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:30.923 --> 02:58:34.445]  And the new Alex Jones Was Right shirt.
[02:58:34.725 --> 02:58:35.606]  Very good looking shirt.
[02:58:35.946 --> 02:58:36.846]  Big red thunderbolt.
[02:58:36.926 --> 02:58:38.447]  Alex Jones Was Right on the back.
[02:58:39.108 --> 02:58:40.268]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.528 --> 02:58:41.849]  This is a limited edition shirt.
[02:58:42.689 --> 02:58:44.831]  We're only selling this limited edition for one month.
[02:58:45.551 --> 02:58:49.033]  And it's $24.95, so we get $18 from the sales.
[02:58:49.073 --> 02:58:49.813]  It's really nice fabric.
[02:58:49.833 --> 02:58:51.034]  It's an expensive shirt for us to make.
[02:58:52.366 --> 02:58:54.867]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[02:58:54.887 --> 02:58:57.948]  When we get together and stand up against the globalists, we are unstoppable.
[02:58:57.968 --> 02:58:58.628]  I'm counting on you.
[02:58:58.648 --> 02:58:59.028]  Stay with us.
