[00:00.000 --> 00:28.700]  After the Russians secured Pentagon-run biolabs in Ukraine, the U.S. Embassy was caught
[00:28.700 --> 00:34.320]  deleting proof of this from their website. And when the Russians shared documents showing
[00:34.320 --> 00:39.760]  the Ukrainian Minister of Health ordering employees of these biolabs to destroy all
[00:39.760 --> 00:46.120]  deadly pathogens, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio asked the U.S. State Department if there was
[00:46.120 --> 00:52.280]  any truth to this. Undersecretary Victoria Newland not only confirmed the presence of
[00:52.280 --> 00:58.520]  the labs, but confirmed that they contain weaponized biological agents, that they now
[00:58.520 --> 01:05.720]  fear the Russians will indiscriminately use to start a world war. The Pentagon calls them
[01:05.720 --> 01:13.200]  bio-research labs and containment labs, and claim their clandestine operation is all somehow
[01:13.200 --> 01:19.960]  in self-defense. But they are admittedly creating and storing weaponized biological material,
[01:19.960 --> 01:25.640]  and so these biolabs are in violation of Article 1 of the Prohibition on Biological
[01:25.640 --> 01:32.680]  Weapons. During the past couple years, citizens of the world have been getting an advanced
[01:32.680 --> 01:39.160]  education on bio-weapons, and the very same crooks we see foisting the great reset medical
[01:39.160 --> 01:47.880]  tyranny are involved in the Ukrainian bio-weapons labs. This is all being paid for with tax dollars
[01:47.880 --> 01:55.960]  through the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the DTRA. U.S. company Black & Veatch
[01:55.960 --> 02:03.880]  has been working closely with the DTRA building bio-weapons labs since 2003. Black & Veatch
[02:03.880 --> 02:11.440]  share an office in Kiev with MetaBiota, who signed an $18.4 million contract with Black
[02:11.440 --> 02:19.480]  & Veatch in 2014. MetaBiota got their start in 2015 with funding from Hunter Biden's
[02:19.480 --> 02:26.320]  Rosemont Seneca Technology Partners, who gave MetaBiota $30 million to help protect the
[02:26.320 --> 02:32.920]  world from the spread of epidemics. This is the very same Rosemont Seneca that was mysteriously
[02:32.920 --> 02:40.720]  wired $3.5 million from the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, and the very same MetaBiota
[02:40.720 --> 02:47.360]  partnered with Peter Dazek's EcoHealth Alliance, the group that Dr. Fauci used to funnel money
[02:47.360 --> 02:56.440]  to the Wuhan lab for gain of function research in 2014. In 2014, MetaBiota, EcoHealth Alliance,
[02:56.440 --> 03:03.160]  and the Wuhan Institute of Virology were together researching infectious diseases deriving from
[03:03.160 --> 03:11.160]  Chinese bats. MetaBiota is working with known CIA front in Cutel. It is funded by the U.S.
[03:11.160 --> 03:17.920]  Department of Defense, the NIH, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Google, and the
[03:17.920 --> 03:25.520]  National Geographic Society. MetaBiota's founder, Nathan Wolfe, sits on the board of EcoHealth
[03:25.520 --> 03:32.440]  Alliance and is a member of DARPA's Defense Science Research Council. In 2012, he wrote
[03:32.440 --> 03:38.520]  a book titled The Viral Storm, the Dawn of a New Pandemic Age, wherein he thanked his
[03:38.520 --> 03:46.400]  friends, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, and biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolik. Boris Nikolik
[03:46.400 --> 03:54.560]  was named Jeffrey Epstein's successor executor upon his death. Wolfe has also been seen hanging
[03:54.560 --> 04:01.240]  out with Ghislaine Maxwell on multiple occasions. He is also one of Klaus Schwab's young global
[04:01.240 --> 04:07.880]  leaders, trained on how to enact the Great Reset Agenda being directed by the World Economic
[04:07.880 --> 04:15.760]  Forum. Russia claims the Pentagon has over 30 biolabs in the Ukraine alone. China claims
[04:15.760 --> 04:23.600]  they are operating 336 biolabs in 30 different countries. And now members of our corrupt
[04:23.600 --> 04:30.120]  U.S. government are saying this is all a Russian conspiracy and that we should soon expect
[04:30.120 --> 04:35.760]  a false flag attack from Russia. If there is a biological or chemical weapon incident
[04:35.760 --> 04:40.400]  or attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that 100 percent it would
[04:40.400 --> 04:44.840]  be the Russians that would be behind it? There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is
[04:44.840 --> 04:52.280]  classic Russian technique to blame on the other guy, what they're planning to do themselves.
[04:52.280 --> 05:01.360]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:01.360 --> 05:07.720]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we
[05:07.720 --> 05:13.640]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, the X3. That has all
[05:13.640 --> 05:20.560]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[05:20.560 --> 05:26.040]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[05:26.040 --> 05:31.040]  the population in the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So
[05:31.040 --> 05:35.800]  we had it on sale 50 percent off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going
[05:35.800 --> 05:40.160]  to come in for a long time? So I took it back to full process. I was just thinking, you
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.680]  know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus this is the right product everybody
[05:44.680 --> 05:49.440]  needs. So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[05:49.440 --> 05:54.040]  it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50 percent off until it
[05:54.040 --> 06:20.040]  sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50 percent off.
[06:24.040 --> 06:37.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining us for another live, original, teleprompter
[06:37.840 --> 06:45.840]  free edition of the Alex Jones show. Nobody's telling me what to say. No big establishment
[06:45.840 --> 06:51.800]  left us billionaires or paying the payroll around here. We are funded and financed by
[06:51.800 --> 06:58.960]  viewers and listeners like you. Wow, it's Thursday, March 10th, 2022. And I'm looking
[06:58.960 --> 07:02.720]  at all this incredible intel and information. I'm going to lay it all out today here in
[07:02.720 --> 07:08.120]  the next four hours. And I'm thinking, what is the most important thing here? What is
[07:08.120 --> 07:14.800]  the patterns within the patterns? And what do people really tune in here for? And what
[07:14.800 --> 07:21.760]  is it I can do that protects my family from a nuclear war and by extension your family?
[07:21.760 --> 07:26.600]  And what can you do that will protect your family and by extension my family? Because
[07:26.600 --> 07:37.200]  that's really the most important thing facing us. So what do we do to inform the general
[07:37.200 --> 07:43.600]  public and to make sure that the criminals that have hijacked and run our government
[07:43.600 --> 07:48.240]  and most other governments understand that they're not going to get away with starting
[07:48.240 --> 07:53.080]  a nuclear war? Now, you saw they were going to keep their COVID lockdowns going forever.
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.440]  They were going to keep the force injections going forever. And in countries and areas
[07:56.440 --> 08:02.560]  they control, it's only getting worse. But in places where people stood up and said no
[08:02.560 --> 08:07.360]  and didn't comply and their own doctors and scientists and bureaucracy stood up and said,
[08:07.360 --> 08:13.000]  we're not going to comply with this evil, it's been rolled back, it's been stopped.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.060]  And now there's major lawsuits and criminal investigations around the world and there's
[08:17.060 --> 08:23.840]  mainstream news saying that indictments are coming of major big pharma executives. So
[08:23.840 --> 08:30.600]  the moral is when we push back, things get better. When we submit, they get worse. So
[08:30.600 --> 08:37.520]  the moral is the establishment is now bragging that, oh, this is the next leg of the Great
[08:37.520 --> 08:42.360]  Reset. We're going to use this to end fossil fuels. I've got the Davos Group documents
[08:42.360 --> 08:45.960]  all right here. I'll show them to you. New statements about how they're going to bring
[08:45.960 --> 08:50.960]  in their cashless society on the back of the sanctions on the Russians by training everyone
[08:50.960 --> 08:58.000]  that any type of Russian commodity or gold or silver or anything out of Russia, even
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.920]  stuff that goes through Russia will be banned and will be tracked and controlled. They're
[09:03.920 --> 09:08.440]  now admitting that they're using this for the next phase of their lockdown, the energy
[09:08.440 --> 09:17.920]  lockdown, the surveillance lockdown, the global social credit score lockdown. Now, sure, I
[09:17.920 --> 09:21.920]  said two years ago, the next phase would be war right after they had pushed their COVID
[09:21.920 --> 09:27.080]  power grab as far as they thought they could. They would then declare they were surrendering,
[09:27.080 --> 09:31.240]  but would behind the scenes continue the power grab on the COVID angle. That's just a dirty
[09:31.240 --> 09:37.580]  military tactic. But what comes after the war that starts up, the accelerated financial
[09:37.580 --> 09:46.520]  collapse, which they're engineering at every level to be blamed on Russia. So you can love
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.040]  Putin or hate Putin, love the Russians, hate the Putin or be neutral like I am, but you
[09:51.040 --> 09:55.120]  still got to know they didn't start this. You still got to know the globalist are the
[09:55.120 --> 09:58.720]  ones that devalued the dollar. They're the ones that hyperinflated the currency. They're
[09:58.720 --> 10:03.960]  the ones that shut off all the pipelines. 90% of the fuel increase of cost we've seen
[10:03.960 --> 10:14.920]  the last 13 months came before this Russia invasion. That's a fact. So here are the stacks.
[10:14.920 --> 10:20.720]  Massive breaking unbelievable developments in Ukraine. Unbelievable. We're going to hit
[10:20.720 --> 10:28.360]  this first when we come back. Then the incredible shutdown of our energy by design and the heads
[10:28.360 --> 10:34.120]  of federal agencies laughing at people when they talk about folks going bankrupt. Well,
[10:34.120 --> 10:37.920]  of course, what do you think the great reset was all about in two years of lockdowns around
[10:37.920 --> 10:45.440]  the world and your business being nonessential and all of it. The world economic form admitting
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.880]  they're bringing in a world ID control system in the back of it in their own press releases
[10:50.880 --> 11:02.960]  and their own documents. And then the covid stack. Boy, does this stack tie in to the
[11:02.960 --> 11:08.280]  war stack because they all tie in together. The UN says they believe that a new deadly
[11:08.280 --> 11:12.560]  virus will be released out of the Ukraine conflict. Just like I told you, oh man, may
[11:12.560 --> 11:18.920]  global warming, a deadly bird flu chimera will come out of the jungles while they were
[11:18.920 --> 11:25.280]  making it in the lab in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and then transferring it to Wulon.
[11:25.280 --> 11:33.280]  Oh, it's your fault. It's the global warming. After all, we've had all the usual suspects
[11:33.280 --> 11:37.960]  tell us that most humans will be dead with the end of the world by 2030. And then the
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.200]  other globalists say they want to collapse society to starve and kill 90% of us by 2030.
[11:43.200 --> 11:48.640]  And then I point that out with all the quotes with MTG and big national news stories. Dozens
[11:48.640 --> 11:55.160]  of publications, MTG is insane. She agreed with Jones there's a plan to reduce the world's
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.480]  population. So I thought I'd actually show you some of the quotes in the Wall Street
[11:59.480 --> 12:08.080]  Journal in the New York Times in NBC News where they say they want to reduce this by 90%.
[12:08.080 --> 12:17.080]  And then we say, oh, this is pretty scary. Oh, it doesn't exist. What else doesn't exist,
[12:17.080 --> 12:23.840]  ladies and gentlemen? Oh, the bio weapon labs. But you know what I decided to do? I showed
[12:23.840 --> 12:31.840]  you four or five mainstream articles from 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2019. But I thought,
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.880]  you know, why not show you even more? Because everybody's asking how did Jones know there
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.720]  were bio weapon labs in Ukraine? Well, how do I know there's a six flags up by Dallas
[12:41.720 --> 12:46.640]  because it's on a map and I've been there. How do I know that the University of Texas
[12:46.640 --> 12:53.760]  is in central Austin? Because it's there. I've been there. I have a whole stack of mainstream
[12:53.760 --> 13:01.600]  news bragging about how Obama built bio weapon labs. They call them that with quote, deadly
[13:01.600 --> 13:09.120]  weaponized gain of function. In his eight years. And I'm talking Wall Street Journal,
[13:09.120 --> 13:15.520]  foreign affairs, public affairs, all, you know, State Department. I mean, I don't listen
[13:15.520 --> 13:20.280]  to the Russians. Like you've heard they all they do is lie, right? Our government tells
[13:20.280 --> 13:25.840]  the truth. But I did thought I would just go back and show you where they were bragging
[13:25.840 --> 13:31.920]  about all of it. And they've got articles all over the place that I'm a Kremlin stooge.
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.800]  Because I mean, they said two weeks ago, in full wars is putting out false news. Remember,
[13:36.800 --> 13:41.680]  we were first claiming there's bio weapon labs and that they could claim that the Russians
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.360]  release a bio weapon and then blame them. And now they're saying the Russians are going
[13:46.360 --> 13:49.640]  to release a bio weapon and blame the Ukrainians, the Russians are going to blow up a nuclear
[13:49.640 --> 13:53.560]  power plant and blame the Ukrainians, and that the Russians are going to launch chemical
[13:53.560 --> 13:58.120]  attacks and blame the Ukrainians and that the NATO will then attack Russia. Now you
[13:58.120 --> 14:01.720]  think the Russians would actually bring NATO in so that we'd have a nuclear war and lose
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.040]  the war? No, they're counting on nuclear brinks would ship to take over Ukraine, install
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.520]  a new government. That's their goal, whether you agree with it or not. It's not start World
[14:10.520 --> 14:16.040]  War three and lose the war. Do they have a motive to release bio weapons? No, they have
[14:16.040 --> 14:20.200]  a motive to release chemical weapons. No, they have a motive to blow up a nuclear power
[14:20.200 --> 14:26.280]  plant. No, and it's confirmed that the Ukrainians have lied about everything. That's just the
[14:26.280 --> 14:36.080]  facts. Did Putin walk into a trap? Yeah, and I mean, I know Putin's not stupid, but I know
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.920]  the military. I know a lot of people in the military in the last eight years that have
[14:40.920 --> 14:50.160]  trained giant stay behind networks to destroy the Russians. The US Green Berets, all of
[14:50.160 --> 14:56.160]  them have been there. Giant weapon stores just preparing for the setup that Putin walked
[14:56.160 --> 15:04.440]  right into. And you see the Russians are getting torn up bad. And this is just a damn disaster.
[15:04.440 --> 15:07.280]  So ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be laying it all out. What did I say two weeks
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.600]  still in the started? I said, well, Putin's gone into the trap. I thought he was smarter
[15:11.600 --> 15:19.360]  than that. But I guess they just think, hey, we got to stop the West putting weapons on
[15:19.360 --> 15:23.760]  our borders. So they knew they were going into a trap, I guess. But this is a bad, bad
[15:23.760 --> 15:27.840]  situation, ladies and gentlemen. It gives the new world order the perfect cover to release
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.680]  biological weapons and blame it on the Ruskies. And if you don't think they're getting ready
[15:32.680 --> 15:39.560]  to do that, you must have a very low IQ. And I know you don't. So get right with Jesus,
[15:39.560 --> 15:46.640]  folks. We're on the downhill slide into hell right now. Pray for global awakening. Pray
[15:46.640 --> 15:51.240]  for the stupid globalist elites to finally get some type of concern and fear in their
[15:51.240 --> 15:56.680]  minds to back up before they kill us all, including themselves.
[15:56.680 --> 16:04.960]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and
[16:04.960 --> 16:11.400]  viewers. If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your
[16:11.400 --> 16:16.120]  immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will

[16:36.160 --> 16:41.160]  notes. We were sold out of X3 for a long time. And I had it on sale for 50% off. A lot of
[16:41.160 --> 16:44.360]  folks are getting it. And I was thinking, you know what? I'm going to bring it back
[16:44.360 --> 16:48.840]  on sale again, just until it sells out. Because even though we won't make as much money in
[16:48.840 --> 16:52.960]  the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales
[16:52.960 --> 17:00.200]  in now to stay on air. See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.

[18:55.600 --> 19:03.120]  sold out at infowarstore.com. I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years against
[19:03.120 --> 19:08.560]  the globalist. I wanted to stop their agenda. I wanted to wake up the world and stop them
[19:08.560 --> 19:14.000]  dead in their tracks before they went operational. But we failed. Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.720]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed, but they are going ahead with their full operational
[19:19.720 --> 19:24.200]  deindustrialization great reset. And that's why it's more important than ever that all
[19:24.200 --> 19:28.880]  viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show, because people are ready
[19:28.880 --> 19:32.720]  to wake up and ready to hear the truth. So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[19:32.720 --> 19:36.640]  and trying to stop their agenda. We've also got to get personally prepared. And one of
[19:36.640 --> 19:40.080]  the number one things to do is high quality, storeable food. We've got the best food ready
[19:40.080 --> 19:45.520]  to ship at very affordable prices at infowarstore.com. So whether it's a month or a six month or
[19:45.520 --> 19:50.800]  a year supply or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now. Lock your orders in before
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.560]  food prices go up and before there are long lines and waits. Because believe me, serious
[19:55.560 --> 20:01.840]  times are coming. Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[20:01.840 --> 20:08.840]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:31.840 --> 20:38.840]  All right. Let me just get calm here for a moment. Let's have a moment of stillness and
[20:42.720 --> 20:46.800]  only think about where we are and what we're on the edge of. Because if you think things
[20:46.800 --> 20:53.800]  are bad right now, I don't just sense, but I intellectually see absolute doom in our
[20:53.800 --> 21:00.800]  futures. But humanity has stood at the precipice many times before. And we've pulled back
[21:02.560 --> 21:09.560]  because we shot God's grace and repented. And we need that now. When I look at the demonic
[21:09.560 --> 21:24.560]  animation that is in the different European Union and U.S. diplomats, U.K. diplomats,
[21:24.760 --> 21:31.760]  you can really know who the true forces of evil are. It is the criminals that hijack
[21:32.600 --> 21:38.200]  control of our country. And we have the energy secretary, we have the transportation secretary,
[21:38.200 --> 21:45.200]  we have Biden and other clips, Jimmy Kimmel making jokes and Stephen Colbert making jokes
[21:46.560 --> 21:51.040]  and ABC and NBC and CBS. I mean, I had more than 10 clips yesterday I never played. I
[21:51.040 --> 21:58.040]  got a whole bunch of clips today of them laughing and making fun of the gas prices and saying,
[21:58.240 --> 22:05.240]  oh, Americans want to pay more. Yeah, we have compilations of it. But do you really want
[22:05.240 --> 22:12.240]  to see it? Do you really want to hear it? These people are just like Marie Antoinette
[22:12.360 --> 22:17.240]  at the start of the French Revolution when they reportedly came to them and said, we're
[22:17.240 --> 22:22.280]  starving to death. There's 100,000 people mob out there that says they're going to break
[22:22.280 --> 22:25.960]  in the palace if you don't open up the emergency granaries. We know you've got enough food
[22:25.960 --> 22:32.960]  for millions, literally. And they said, nope. No one knows if she really said, let them
[22:32.960 --> 22:39.960]  eat cake, but they did say no. And they broke in there and killed everybody. And Klaus Schwab
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.640]  has said, we're going to make the world angrier, we're going to cut the food and water off
[22:49.640 --> 22:53.520]  and the power off and we're going to have the public overthrow all the governments and
[22:53.520 --> 22:59.120]  then we're going to come in as the corporations and take over. And I played two weeks ago,
[22:59.120 --> 23:06.120]  Larry Fink on television, on international TV at the Davos Group this year, just last
[23:11.440 --> 23:17.600]  month saying we're discrediting the governments right now and the corporations are about to
[23:17.600 --> 23:24.080]  take over when they're the ones that literally installed all the people that are doing this
[23:24.080 --> 23:29.120]  to us. So we can talk about Russia and Ukraine all day and China and North Korea and Mexico
[23:29.120 --> 23:36.120]  and the open borders and the dollar and the gas prices, but it's Larry Fink and Prince
[23:36.760 --> 23:43.760]  Charles and Bill Gates. I mean, those are the jerks. Those are the a-holes and those
[23:44.440 --> 23:49.200]  words are too kind for them. I mean, these people are literally your mortal enemy. They
[23:49.200 --> 23:54.080]  cooked up the virus. They released it. They're coming after your rights, creating a world
[23:54.080 --> 23:59.280]  ID. They're creating a digital world ID. They're starting wars. They've been at one-sided
[23:59.280 --> 24:05.640]  trade deals to build communist China into the most powerful evil the planet's ever seen.
[24:05.640 --> 24:12.640]  And we are, as I said, sleepwalking over the edge of a cliff right now. Let me do this.
[24:12.640 --> 24:19.640]  This is a shorter segment. Longer segments are coming up. I'm just going to be judicious
[24:20.040 --> 24:25.440]  when we come back and control myself. And I'm just going to cover this stack right here
[24:25.440 --> 24:31.800]  of the current war news. And then I'm going to hit the bio weapon labs, which it's not
[24:31.800 --> 24:38.000]  confirmed because Victoria Nuland told Congress three days ago that yes, the U.S. is bio weapon
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  labs. It's on record in congressional funding over $10 billion. And hell, they just gave
[24:47.760 --> 24:54.760]  another $13.6 yesterday. $5 billion to overthrow the government once. $10 billion in weapons
[24:56.560 --> 25:03.560]  over the years. $10 billion plus in bio weapon labs. Now another $13 billion. And make no
[25:03.560 --> 25:07.480]  mistake, that's a corrupt government they've gotten control of, the poorest country in
[25:07.480 --> 25:13.920]  Europe, but extremely rich when it comes to natural resources. They run that. The deep
[25:13.920 --> 25:17.880]  state runs that as their private piggy bank and they launder the money and don't even
[25:17.880 --> 25:24.880]  hide that all of them, Pelosi, Nuland, Biden, Obama, all of them have family members that
[25:25.360 --> 25:31.240]  make millions a month off of Ukraine. And the big guy, you know, has made reportedly
[25:31.240 --> 25:38.240]  a billion bucks or more. So Putin just came in and took over their piggy bank. Putin just
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.400]  came in and pissed in their face and they are hopping mad. And that's why they got all
[25:47.400 --> 25:52.680]  their surrogates all over TV saying, let's have a nuclear war with Russia. All because
[25:52.680 --> 25:59.600]  Hunter Biden, the crackhead won't get his money. And I love how they're all the news
[25:59.600 --> 26:03.400]  saying Don Jr. is a cokehead because he has high energy and they always say that about
[26:03.400 --> 26:09.920]  me. You got the wrong guy. I don't need stimulants, anything alcohol I've done over the years
[26:09.920 --> 26:14.960]  off and on because it lowers me down. See, the left doesn't have energy folks. They don't
[26:14.960 --> 26:21.360]  get like Don Jr. giving a powerful speech and he's really becoming a good orator. One
[26:21.360 --> 26:24.080]  of the best. I mean, just a couple of years ago, he was okay. Now I'm like, damn, that's
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.640]  a powerful speech. That's better than Joel Oldstein or somebody or Martin Luther King.
[26:28.640 --> 26:33.000]  And I'm not kissing his ass. I mean, he's just come a long way and they go, oh, he's
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.640]  on cocaine. That that's cocaine. No, that's you people that need cocaine to get up off
[26:37.640 --> 26:44.640]  your ass. So I'm going to cover it all. It's just unbelievable. I mean, I can feel this
[26:50.640 --> 26:54.520]  whole four hour show with Eric and stuff they're saying and no laughing at us and getting off
[26:54.520 --> 26:58.680]  on it and giggling because see people that have a conscience would feel bad about being
[26:58.680 --> 27:05.480]  part of the stuff, but they, they feel good. They like effing you over and laughing at you
[27:05.480 --> 27:10.120]  and your family while they wage war on you because they're robbing us. They control us.
[27:10.120 --> 27:16.800]  They pimp us out. And so of course they hate us. That's the type of people that sell out.
[27:16.800 --> 27:20.160]  That's the type of people that want to get those positions of power and they know their
[27:20.160 --> 27:26.920]  time's coming to an end. And so they're trying to burn the country down around us. And then
[27:26.920 --> 27:29.920]  I do have a stack of articles. I'm going to do this sometime during the show. We got a
[27:29.920 --> 27:35.640]  couple of big guests who, with the news attacking MTG on my show, talking about the great resets
[27:35.640 --> 27:40.640]  goal of depopulating the earth by 90%. I mean, that's on the Georgia guide stones. That's
[27:40.640 --> 27:46.200]  been quoted by Ted Turner and Bill Gates. And that's been quoted by the Davos group.
[27:46.200 --> 27:51.240]  And I got a bunch of their quotes right here, but imagine the idiots that take the money
[27:51.240 --> 27:55.520]  to write the article saying we're making this up when they themselves are being targeted.
[27:55.520 --> 28:00.360]  So guys, get me that compilation that I had made but never aired. We had a shorter compilation,
[28:00.360 --> 28:05.640]  but about a month ago I said, I want, and we can't find it, just make a new one. I want
[28:05.640 --> 28:11.000]  William Shatner getting off the spaceship a few months ago and saying, not the one on
[28:11.000 --> 28:16.880]  Star Trek, the real spaceship, you know, human space. And we're not 1969 folks. We're in
[28:16.880 --> 28:22.880]  2022. It's really about 2050 for the technology. And he said, oh, just everyone has to die.
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.960]  I'm so sad it's about to happen, but it has to happen. And then Bill Gates saying, we
[28:27.960 --> 28:32.880]  got to get the human number down to zero, the Ted talk. And we've got all the usual suspects
[28:32.880 --> 28:40.000]  like AOC and Beto, Rourke saying, oh, we're all be dead by 2030 because they're being
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.400]  told it's an economic collapse, a financial collapse that can't be stopped so that even
[28:44.400 --> 28:48.080]  the politicians believe this is coming and do all this evil stuff getting ready because
[28:48.080 --> 28:51.120]  they're told you'll be protected, but almost everybody else is going to die. So they're
[28:51.120 --> 28:54.440]  getting us ready for these cataclysms, they're engineering, but they think we're too dumb
[28:54.440 --> 29:21.440]  to point out that they let out a battle plan and stop them.
[29:21.440 --> 29:29.760]  So, again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun, they are 50%
[29:29.760 --> 29:35.320]  off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.200]  in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens
[29:40.200 --> 29:44.400]  versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with
[29:44.400 --> 29:48.320]  vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're amazing. And they're an info war store
[29:48.320 --> 29:53.720]  dot com. And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to
[29:53.720 --> 29:57.560]  run the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made
[29:57.560 --> 30:05.200]  in heaven. It has been noted by many a historian. The first casualty of war is the truth. And
[30:05.200 --> 30:12.000]  the next big casualty isn't even the people that die. No, that invariably follows. But
[30:12.000 --> 30:20.280]  first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[30:20.280 --> 30:25.920]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[30:25.920 --> 30:34.600]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored. You can
[30:34.600 --> 30:40.360]  be arrested. You can be a prison. And of course now Canada's introduced legislation that if
[30:40.360 --> 30:46.560]  you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech
[30:46.560 --> 30:51.960]  online that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[30:51.960 --> 30:56.400]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info
[30:56.400 --> 31:02.920]  wars dot com more important than ever. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[31:02.920 --> 31:07.600]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[31:07.600 --> 31:12.680]  and thank goodness for info wars store dot com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down
[31:12.680 --> 31:17.640]  some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy
[31:17.640 --> 31:23.240]  turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and
[31:23.240 --> 31:28.200]  the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance
[31:28.200 --> 31:33.640]  at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore list.
[31:33.640 --> 31:38.560]  I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support
[31:38.560 --> 31:44.280]  they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[31:44.280 --> 31:49.120]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough
[31:49.120 --> 31:53.760]  to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity
[31:53.760 --> 31:58.720]  you need for every day and sore list can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[31:58.720 --> 32:04.920]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research. Now, if you
[32:04.920 --> 32:11.000]  read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function, deliberative process and
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.200]  research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza, MERS
[32:16.200 --> 32:20.920]  and ZARS viruses. There's nothing about ZARS like viruses. And it's a research funding
[32:20.920 --> 32:25.520]  pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition. It's when you come to a four way intersection,
[32:25.520 --> 32:29.760]  there's the stops on you stop, you look both ways and then you proceed. And so it's also
[32:29.760 --> 32:34.320]  it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function. But they'll argue
[32:34.320 --> 32:39.160]  that this is actually characterization and qualification research. So, you know, Rand
[32:39.160 --> 32:42.320]  and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right. They don't quite know what they're talking
[32:42.320 --> 32:45.720]  about calling it gain of function. You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's
[32:45.720 --> 32:49.680]  why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[32:49.680 --> 32:54.360]  that mimic what the viruses do. But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function
[32:54.360 --> 32:57.800]  and you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike.
[32:57.800 --> 33:00.800]  We love you.
[33:00.800 --> 33:14.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. Big Brother,
[33:14.080 --> 33:23.080]  mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live
[33:23.080 --> 33:29.360]  from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[33:29.360 --> 33:33.840]  Puppet Biden has devastated US energy in only 14 months. We've gone from the number one
[33:33.840 --> 33:40.240]  exporter in the world to the biggest importer in the world, and he's only getting started
[33:40.240 --> 33:45.960]  in the shutdown. But here is the head of the energy department who admits they're raising
[33:45.960 --> 33:52.320]  our gas prices to force us under electric cars that get electricity generated by carbon
[33:52.320 --> 33:58.640]  as well. It is a total fraud. Here is Grandholm bragging. And then here's some of shocky denying
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.280]  what's happening while Biden admits it. Obviously, we have the acute issues with the colonial pipeline,
[34:04.280 --> 34:08.400]  ransomware attack, but looking more holistically in a macro view, how does this speed up the
[34:08.400 --> 34:14.360]  efforts at DOE to move in more of a renewable direction since this is going to have an impact
[34:14.360 --> 34:19.600]  on people at the pump? Yeah, I mean, we obviously are all in on making
[34:19.600 --> 34:25.920]  sure that we meet the president's goals of getting to 100% clean electricity by 2035
[34:25.920 --> 34:32.720]  and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. And you know, if you drive an electric car, this
[34:32.720 --> 34:37.200]  would not be affecting you clearly. No more subsidies for fossil fuel industry.
[34:37.200 --> 34:42.520]  No more drilling on federal lands. No more drilling, including offshore. No ability for
[34:42.520 --> 34:49.040]  the oil industry to continue to drill. Period. Ends. So the suggestion that we are not allowing
[34:49.040 --> 34:55.480]  companies to drill is inaccurate. The suggestion that that is what is hindering or preventing
[34:55.480 --> 35:01.480]  gas prices to come down is inaccurate. Would President Biden rescind his executive order
[35:01.480 --> 35:08.120]  that halts new oil and natural gas leases on public plants? Well, 90% of them happen
[35:08.120 --> 35:15.120]  on private lands, as I'm sure you know. And there are 9,000 unused approved drilling permits.
[35:15.120 --> 35:19.880]  So I would suggest you ask the oil companies why they're not using those if there's a desire
[35:19.880 --> 35:23.520]  to drill more. Would President Biden ever undo his executive
[35:23.520 --> 35:27.560]  order that stopped the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline?
[35:27.560 --> 35:30.160]  Are you suggesting that would solve the gas prices issue?
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.840]  Well, do you think that that would maybe affect prices faster than getting the whole country
[35:35.840 --> 35:39.240]  off of fossil fuels? I actually don't think it would.
[35:39.240 --> 35:44.840]  We have more oil than anybody, okay? And it's an incredible thing that has happened over
[35:44.840 --> 35:49.240]  the last few years, a lot of great things, and you're paying what, $2 a gallon for your
[35:49.240 --> 35:54.480]  gasoline, that's okay. You know what that's like? That's like a tax cut. That's bigger
[35:54.480 --> 36:00.840]  than a tax cut. If Biden got in, you'd be paying $7, $8, $9, didn't this say get rid
[36:00.840 --> 36:04.720]  of your car? Last month we announced a $5 billion investment
[36:04.720 --> 36:08.960]  to build out a nationwide electric vehicle charging network. So the people from rural
[36:08.960 --> 36:16.680]  to suburban to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings of driving an EV.
[36:16.680 --> 36:19.760]  By the way, for people that don't know about the oil business, who maybe aren't from places
[36:19.760 --> 36:25.240]  like Texas, we're out of that family that's worked and done some studying on it, she said
[36:25.240 --> 36:31.560]  there's 9,000 permits to drill. Yeah, those permits stay open and then they'll usually
[36:31.560 --> 36:35.760]  drill right next door and get nothing or hit saltwater so they don't use the rest of the
[36:35.760 --> 36:40.480]  permits. They'll get a string of permits, say for 20 wells, a small company, a big company,
[36:40.480 --> 36:45.080]  maybe 100, and then they start drilling and if they don't hit and they put the math in
[36:45.080 --> 36:49.120]  and it's not going well, they didn't think that their geology is wrong and they move
[36:49.120 --> 36:55.680]  on. So there's more than 9,000 open permits and that's because they're failed oil fields.
[36:55.680 --> 37:03.520]  I mean, there are tens of thousands of dead wells. I would probably say hundreds of thousands.
[37:03.520 --> 37:09.960]  I mean, I know the numbers are very, very high. There's thousands of dead wells in Texas.
[37:09.960 --> 37:15.960]  So this is just incredible. You know, my late grandmother and my mom's side was never really
[37:15.960 --> 37:21.480]  an oil baroness but they had quite a few little oil wells out in West Texas that her father
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.600]  had gotten and they made some money back when she was a little girl but the wells were dead
[37:26.600 --> 37:31.480]  and empty and then about 20 years ago they started filling back up with oil so my mom
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.280]  gets some nice little oil checks and runs off and gives it to the local liberal church
[37:36.280 --> 37:42.640]  or whatever but the point is, is that that's what's going on here and it's not from fossil
[37:42.640 --> 37:48.400]  fuel, it's abiotic, they've proven it, it's amazing. It's like somebody built the planet
[37:48.400 --> 37:52.720]  for us and gave us the energy we would need. Isn't that interesting? That then creates
[37:52.720 --> 38:00.960]  carbon dioxide that plants breathe to create oxygen. Wow, thank you God for that. Okay,
[38:00.960 --> 38:05.640]  let's start drilling into it and then I should add Sean Stone, filmmaker, talk show host
[38:05.640 --> 38:11.080]  in his own right. His father's film has been banned on YouTube, it's official. It was made
[38:11.080 --> 38:18.520]  Ukraine Burning. It was made seven years ago and because it's accurate, it has been banned.
[38:18.520 --> 38:22.920]  So first they've had Alex Jones, they try to ban Joe Rogan, they ban Donald Trump and
[38:22.920 --> 38:29.760]  now Oliver Stone isn't allowed to have movies that he gives the public for free. That's
[38:29.760 --> 38:35.080]  liberal, that's freedom. I mean McCarthy never dreamed of something like that but as long
[38:35.080 --> 38:40.840]  as it's the left with the social credit score crushing it's all, it's good. But I called
[38:40.840 --> 38:44.920]  Sean up yesterday and I said, do you think your pops can have a problem? We posted it
[38:44.920 --> 38:51.120]  banned on video and he says no, he just wants it out, post it. So Ukraine Burning and the
[38:51.120 --> 38:55.400]  next film they made as well, that's being censored, both those are posted at banned
[38:55.400 --> 39:01.160]  on video free of charge. In fact, we're paying for the bandwidth and let me tell you, we're
[39:01.160 --> 39:05.160]  paying hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. We've got some of the cheapest bandwidth
[39:05.160 --> 39:09.360]  out there but when you've got five, six, seven million viewers a day just on banned on video,
[39:09.360 --> 39:15.920]  in fact it's more than that now. It is expensive show. Thank you ladies and gentlemen for supporting
[39:15.920 --> 39:19.120]  us and people say, hey, build your own thing. You know, you're kicked off Twitter, you're
[39:19.120 --> 39:23.200]  kicked off Instagram, Facebook, YouTube. Why don't you build your own thing? Jones, well
[39:23.200 --> 39:28.160]  we did, the listeners built it. And baby, that tank takes a lot of gas because that
[39:28.160 --> 39:33.480]  engine's big because it's sending out a lot of horsepower. We are kicking some ash and
[39:33.480 --> 39:39.880]  that means you are, but that means we need cold, hard cash. Just the bandwidth on banned
[39:39.880 --> 39:47.680]  on video, the non streaming is $150,000 a month. The streaming of my show, millions
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.760]  a day, you want to know how much it cost? I was meeting with some of the folks last week
[39:52.760 --> 39:55.920]  and they said, if you just don't have the player open up on the site, that would save
[39:55.920 --> 40:00.480]  you a couple hundred thousand a year. But study show, it'll stop people clicking. And
[40:00.480 --> 40:04.640]  I'm like, just screw it. Then full on, God will provide the money if that's what God
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.440]  wants. And literally I was in the red last week and just pulling my hair out, not wanting
[40:09.440 --> 40:14.200]  to lay off crew. And then God just opened a few doors up for us that brought us back
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.840]  to the black. But it's crazy. We've never been allowed to get super into the black.
[40:19.840 --> 40:22.920]  I guess God wants to keep me really hungry because that makes me innovate. Ask God, why
[40:22.920 --> 40:28.680]  do you always keep me right with just enough? And it's because that keeps you hungry, son.
[40:28.680 --> 40:34.880]  Not that I want the money to get the fuel to fund the operation. And then that diversifies
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.760]  everything we do. So God is perfect. And it's always teaching us in full work store.com.
[40:39.760 --> 40:43.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a bunch of products they're about to sell out. But they're so
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.120]  important for everybody's immune system and body that we're going to just keep them 50%
[40:48.120 --> 40:53.080]  off till they sell out. And that is X3, tri iodine for immune system, your body, all
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.280]  cellular function, 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities from lack of iodine. This is
[40:57.280 --> 41:02.080]  the good iodine you can actually absorb. It's 50% off. Winter sun's the highest quality
[41:02.080 --> 41:07.200]  D3 with vitamin K for immune system. And all your body's functions as well. It's essential
[41:07.200 --> 41:13.080]  as well. It's 50% off. And then brain force ultra, an incredible, fast acting, and then
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.760]  goes away quick. You want long, we got 10 hour clean energy with turbo force. You want
[41:17.760 --> 41:23.320]  five, six hour good clean energy. They're all different formulas. Because you can't
[41:23.320 --> 41:27.960]  put every type of healthy stimulant in one deal because they interact badly some of them.
[41:27.960 --> 41:32.200]  But so we have three very well known formulas that we've jacked up and made even better
[41:32.200 --> 41:35.320]  that have the things that work synergistically but not in a toxic way. That's why there's
[41:35.320 --> 41:39.680]  three different formulas, different things for different people. Turbo force, 10 hours,
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.880]  unbelievable, you know, 70 Sam level energy. You've got brain force plus is good clean,
[41:44.880 --> 41:51.880]  not bad for you, good for you, five, six hour energy. And then we've got brain force plus
[41:51.880 --> 41:56.720]  hits in 15, 20 minutes, last a couple hours. And it's just awesome because again, that's
[41:56.720 --> 42:00.760]  what I take if I'm tired at night and got a lot of stuff to get done. It's just a good
[42:00.760 --> 42:06.400]  clean, happy energy, not grind your teeth energy. So infowarstore.com or triple eight
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.760]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. Turbo force, brain force plus are excellent,
[42:11.760 --> 42:17.280]  but also brain force ultra is amazing. It's something special it does with my brain particularly
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.480]  but everybody says it. It just really gives you this clean, amazing. I don't want to say
[42:22.480 --> 42:28.120]  it's hallucinogenic because it's not, but it's definitely psychotropic in a natural
[42:28.120 --> 42:34.760]  way. infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine and you
[42:34.760 --> 42:40.760]  fund the tip of the savage battering ram that's on fire from enemy attacks, which makes it
[42:40.760 --> 42:45.160]  even better because when we smash into the enemy politically, we burn them. But our oak
[42:45.160 --> 42:51.240]  is so old and so strong that we can just burn 100 times longer than them. And now the flames
[42:51.240 --> 43:00.320]  they poured on us have turned us into a pillar of fire to smash them.
[43:00.320 --> 43:06.680]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February,
[43:06.680 --> 43:12.920]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3. And as all three
[43:12.920 --> 43:19.520]  types of the amazing iodine, your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[43:19.520 --> 43:25.000]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.000]  the population in the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So
[43:30.000 --> 43:34.920]  we had on self 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.880]  in for a long time? So I took it back to full process. I was just thinking, you know what,
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.800]  we need the funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is a great product everybody needs. So
[43:44.800 --> 43:49.200]  to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence, get X3 and experience with yourself
[43:49.200 --> 43:54.800]  and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right
[43:54.800 --> 44:00.640]  now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.200]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul. I've ever had in
[44:05.200 --> 44:11.640]  my 47 years on this planet. I've had a lot of lost, like everybody else has. And it's
[44:11.640 --> 44:22.200]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[44:22.200 --> 44:31.000]  just went for it. And now we're just throwing it all away. I see the general public, ENA,
[44:31.000 --> 44:35.520]  medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral psychologically controlled, 20.
[44:35.520 --> 44:42.200]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist beaker under and it's so incredibly sad. But
[44:42.200 --> 44:48.600]  this is the process of birth and then growth and then falling apart and then degenerating
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.880]  and collapsing and then coming back to life again. It's just the globalist are actively
[44:53.880 --> 44:58.320]  trying to steer and control this process of decadence and collapse to actually end the
[44:58.320 --> 45:04.040]  species as we know it.
[45:04.040 --> 45:07.760]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.040]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[45:13.040 --> 45:17.600]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded
[45:17.600 --> 45:23.360]  up sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last
[45:23.360 --> 45:30.760]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And
[45:30.760 --> 45:34.680]  I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[45:34.680 --> 45:38.960]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started
[45:38.960 --> 45:43.920]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started
[45:43.920 --> 45:49.040]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know,
[45:49.040 --> 45:55.360]  I don't, I don't have to put it on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.480]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[45:59.480 --> 46:06.080]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth. And the
[46:06.080 --> 46:13.440]  next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that is very very follows. But first,
[46:13.440 --> 46:21.080]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[46:21.080 --> 46:26.680]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[46:26.680 --> 46:35.400]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[46:35.400 --> 46:40.760]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned. And of course now Canada is under this legislation
[46:40.760 --> 46:46.880]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[46:46.880 --> 46:52.720]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[46:52.720 --> 46:57.040]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes them
[46:57.040 --> 47:11.320]  more important than ever.
[47:11.320 --> 47:34.560]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central, the tip of the spear is live. This
[47:34.560 --> 47:39.800]  is the Alexandre show I am your humble and thankful host for all of you joining us and
[47:39.800 --> 47:45.000]  now your word of mouth is overriding the censors and conservatively 4 million people a day
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.240]  tune in live and millions and millions watch the archive broadcast at band.video. We are
[47:51.240 --> 47:57.600]  changing the world together. Now I had an old friend of mine, Sean Stone, who is a filmmaker
[47:57.600 --> 48:02.960]  and author and TV producer and news host from all over the world. And I also worked with
[48:02.960 --> 48:08.320]  him on Jesse Ventura's TV show for several seasons. And of course his father is one of
[48:08.320 --> 48:12.280]  the greatest, you know, I'd say top three directors in the world when it comes to serious
[48:12.280 --> 48:20.160]  issues number one. And of course that's Oliver Stone. And so his film Ukraine on Fire from
[48:20.160 --> 48:24.320]  seven years ago, you could turn it on today and it's all predictions came true. But a
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.400]  few years ago he made a another film revealing Ukraine. These are being pulled down off of
[48:30.400 --> 48:34.080]  YouTube off of all the places his dad put them up for free. You know, they were big
[48:34.080 --> 48:40.040]  movies and movie theaters and successful films. And so he sits down and shows both sides and
[48:40.040 --> 48:44.680]  shows what's really going on. Well, they pulled it off of YouTube and people keep putting
[48:44.680 --> 48:50.480]  it up like whack-a-mole. We have posted it back at band.video so that everybody can watch
[48:50.480 --> 48:56.640]  it for free. And that's Ukraine on fire. We're also going to post the other one as well revealing
[48:56.640 --> 49:01.720]  Ukraine that's even more powerful because it was just made two years ago. Now two and
[49:01.720 --> 49:05.760]  a half years ago, but they're both incredible. Talk about Evergreen tomorrow's news today.
[49:05.760 --> 49:10.040]  The only thing I gush over is stuff that's way before it's time. That's where I'm at.
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.640]  My whole system is about what's before it's time, what's ahead of the curve. We're not
[49:14.640 --> 49:19.680]  covering what's about to happen or what's already happening. We cover what's going to
[49:19.680 --> 49:23.360]  happen. And then what happens after that. So look at these headlines that tie into this.
[49:23.360 --> 49:28.000]  This is how the New York Post, it's all confirmed. The federal government, the Democratic Party
[49:28.000 --> 49:35.360]  now wants big tech to censor any Americans amplifying anything they say that's pro-Russian,
[49:35.360 --> 49:38.000]  including in full wars. We're being named in these stories, even though we just show
[49:38.000 --> 49:43.560]  both sides. Federal government using social media giants to censor Americans over COVID
[49:43.560 --> 49:49.400]  and now election questioning and now Ukraine. Wow. Don't let Americans give their view on
[49:49.400 --> 49:56.280]  war. And now we've got Oliver Stone's bombshell historic film censored. Ladies and gentlemen,
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.680]  first it's Alex Jones, then it's Donald Trump. Now it's Oliver Stone. And we've got the
[50:01.680 --> 50:06.040]  New York Times saying, don't search and research facts for yourself in an article saying, don't
[50:06.040 --> 50:11.120]  go down the rabbit hole. The good guys don't tell you to not research, okay? We tell you
[50:11.120 --> 50:16.320]  to research. And it just goes on from there. The EU wants to sanction spreaders of misinformation
[50:16.320 --> 50:22.800]  announcing criminal charges. World Economic Forum severs ties with Ukraine over Russia
[50:22.800 --> 50:28.080]  or with Russia over Ukraine. And it goes on from there. And then Saki gaslighting everyone
[50:28.080 --> 50:32.720]  saying there are no bio labs. We don't have a whole folder right here of mainstream news
[50:32.720 --> 50:38.280]  when Obama built the labs and said they had bio weapons in them. That's coming up after
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.200]  Sean Stone leaves us or I may get into that some with him while he's here. So wow, you
[50:43.200 --> 50:49.840]  were just here with us Sunday. And there was some censorship of your dad's groundbreaking
[50:49.840 --> 50:56.360]  watershed films, evergreen films. And now they're taking them down everywhere. And it's
[50:56.360 --> 51:00.760]  not even an issue. Now Oliver Stone's being censored. I mean, we are becoming what we
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.160]  claim the Russians are. So Sean, thanks for joining us.
[51:05.160 --> 51:10.520]  You cut it, Alex. Yeah. It reminds me of a short film I did in 2008. My first short film
[51:10.520 --> 51:15.320]  was called Singularity. And it was about a plague or a virus that spreads the respiratory
[51:15.320 --> 51:22.880]  coughing. But it creates an entire totalitarian state in America that uses AI surveillance
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.280]  to basically decide who is infected. And actually the whole opposing of the question is, is
[51:28.280 --> 51:32.200]  it the idea that's actually the spreading the spreading of ideas of a conspiracy or
[51:32.200 --> 51:36.800]  saying maybe that, you know, this is totalitarian that this is not just interrupt you. I remember
[51:36.800 --> 51:41.560]  seeing that film right when I first met you. It just come out. I remember watching it. And
[51:41.560 --> 51:45.440]  it was amazing. Say the name again so people can pull that up and see it.
[51:45.440 --> 51:49.880]  Oh, sure. It's called Singularity. It's a Singularity because it's a Singularity moment
[51:49.880 --> 51:53.720]  when basically everything transforms in our reality. And that's really what we feel like
[51:53.720 --> 51:57.200]  we've been living the last two years. So it's on Vimeo on demand. You know, we're at the
[51:57.200 --> 52:01.120]  same place. They can watch Best Kept Secret, my docu series Singularity is also just so
[52:01.120 --> 52:02.120]  impressive.
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.760]  You talk about tomorrow news today. Remember, in 2009, we helped Ventura produce that whole
[52:04.760 --> 52:10.040]  thing on how they would release a virus, have lockdowns, takeover with Dr. Rima Labo. I
[52:10.040 --> 52:14.400]  mean, it's just crazy. We're not bragging, but I wonder why you and I have been so close
[52:14.400 --> 52:16.920]  to this and others didn't see it.
[52:16.920 --> 52:20.320]  I think for us, we just look at its logic, you know, we just see patterns, right? Once
[52:20.320 --> 52:24.800]  you understood the surveillance state was becoming what it was after the Office of Total
[52:24.800 --> 52:28.760]  Information Awareness. Remember, they tried to set that up right after 9-11. And we realized,
[52:28.760 --> 52:32.920]  you know, who these neocons were, essentially that were part of the Iran-Contra scandal.
[52:32.920 --> 52:36.640]  And they were involved in all kinds of money laundering and cocaine trafficking and things
[52:36.640 --> 52:41.280]  like this. And these same people were brought back in the Bush administration and point
[52:41.280 --> 52:45.000]  extra, I remember in particular, right, trying to set up this total information awareness.
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.520]  And then once that was established, then you had Facebook come out and over the years
[52:48.520 --> 52:52.040]  would become aware, right? Google and Facebook and their relationships with intelligence,
[52:52.040 --> 52:57.080]  it seems, you know, especially Google having relationship to the CIA investment arm, I'm
[52:57.080 --> 52:58.680]  blanking on the name of that company.
[52:58.680 --> 53:03.680]  So the point being, we pay attention to what's happening and we see where it's going because
[53:03.680 --> 53:05.640]  we understand that their cycle passed running the world.
[53:05.640 --> 53:10.080]  That's right. Total information awareness networks, all of it.
[53:10.080 --> 53:14.840]  Exactly. So the problem is people don't pay attention. People stay awake. You know, the
[53:14.840 --> 53:20.760]  reason I got interested in news and history is because when the Coastal War happened,
[53:20.760 --> 53:23.720]  I remember, you know, just like when I was a kid saying, you know, Saddam Hussein being
[53:23.720 --> 53:27.840]  compared to Hitler in 91, I remember in the Coastal War and how they portrayed it like
[53:27.840 --> 53:31.600]  the Serbs were these awful barbaric people that were slotting everybody. Well, you actually
[53:31.600 --> 53:36.880]  understand that there was KLA was infiltrated with drug traffickers. It was a CIA operation.
[53:36.880 --> 53:42.120]  They were trying to do, as you know, heroin trafficking through Kosovo. That was very
[53:42.120 --> 53:45.720]  much an intention, not the only intention, but part of the intention is splintering Kosovo
[53:45.720 --> 53:48.040]  off, just like the Yugoslav Wars in general.
[53:48.040 --> 53:53.400]  It's on record that the West started through proxies, the Serb War, and that twice as many
[53:53.400 --> 53:57.080]  Serbs died as any other group. Does that mean the Serbs didn't kill a bunch of people? No,
[53:57.080 --> 54:02.040]  they were attacked first. And then we bombed them with depleted uranium, but it was okay
[54:02.040 --> 54:03.880]  because Bill Clinton is liberal.
[54:03.880 --> 54:08.800]  Exactly, exactly. We forgot all about that war. So, I mean, it's just horrendous how we,
[54:08.800 --> 54:12.320]  people forget. They just, they watch the news and the news is designed to tell you what
[54:12.320 --> 54:15.360]  news. Like you said, they don't tell you about the, they don't tell you about the past. They
[54:15.360 --> 54:18.440]  don't tell you about history. They don't tell you about what's coming. They just say, you
[54:18.440 --> 54:24.200]  know, it's like 1984. Today, Eurasia, you know, Europa is fighting Oceana. And then,
[54:24.200 --> 54:28.080]  you know, the next day, it's, no, Oceana is fighting Atlantia. And it's like, people
[54:28.080 --> 54:30.800]  are just meant to forget. They don't, they're not meant to actually connect dots and see
[54:30.800 --> 54:31.800]  the bigger picture.
[54:31.800 --> 54:33.840]  That's what we are here to do, is to see the bigger picture.
[54:33.840 --> 54:38.400]  Exactly, Sean. But I mean, talk about bigger picture. Your dad saw it seven years ago with
[54:38.400 --> 54:43.040]  the first film, Ukraine on Fire. Now the new one being censored. This is such a big deal
[54:43.040 --> 54:49.500]  that now Oliver Stone is having his, YouTube, Google is taking it down when he's giving
[54:49.500 --> 54:55.440]  away a huge budget movie, a documentary. I mean, that is such an assault, a rape of
[54:55.440 --> 55:00.000]  our freedoms. Now celebrated Academy Award winners are being censored.
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.960]  Well, I can't say it's, it's, it's a big deal because I mean, once you've had Trump,
[55:04.960 --> 55:08.400]  your president getting, you know, be booted off Twitter, once you've seen all kinds of
[55:08.400 --> 55:14.080]  doctors being, you know, called the disinformation agents and, you know, and censored. I mean,
[55:14.080 --> 55:17.400]  why is that a surprise, you know, and all of a sudden documentary? Well, guess what?
[55:17.400 --> 55:21.360]  The Igor Lopatinok is the director of that documentary. He's the one that was running
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.600]  the account. Guess what this, you guess what YouTube, which is really Google, right? Uh,
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.800]  owning it. What did they tell him that the reason they censored it? Because it was just
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.920]  some kind of violent organized crime. That was the implication of literally what they
[55:34.920 --> 55:38.640]  said to him in terms of why they took it down. It was connected to violent organized crime.
[55:38.640 --> 55:43.280]  I guess that being Russia, it's a bizarre, bizarre accusation.
[55:43.280 --> 55:50.160]  That is huge news exclusive here. Ukraine on fire, taken off YouTube by Google because
[55:50.160 --> 55:55.440]  they're claiming interviewing Russian leaders is interviewing organized crime and that your
[55:55.440 --> 55:58.680]  dad and the director organized criminals. I mean, that is, yeah, that's a thing they're
[55:58.680 --> 56:03.200]  using a lot now against even conservatives is saying, Oh, you're involved in organized
[56:03.200 --> 56:04.200]  crime.
[56:04.200 --> 56:10.960]  Right. I mean, it's funny because as we know, conspiracy is always the way that the government
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.520]  has targeted organized crime, right? But when we say conspiracy, they go, Oh, you know,
[56:15.520 --> 56:20.080]  there are no conspiracies unless it's the government making accusations of people connected
[56:20.080 --> 56:21.680]  to organized crime or terrorism.
[56:21.680 --> 56:25.680]  Well, I mean, I get that I get that we've gotten, but that's the paradox. I'm the same
[56:25.680 --> 56:28.680]  way as what you're saying. I'm not putting you down. It's true. I've gotten used to
[56:28.680 --> 56:33.160]  being raped and abused and shut down and lied about and censored. And now Oliver Stone's
[56:33.160 --> 56:36.520]  being taken offline and we're just like, well, we knew that was coming. And that's like the
[56:36.520 --> 56:40.680]  old quote at a Nazi Germany. First, they came for this group and they came for that group.
[56:40.680 --> 56:45.480]  I mean, we're deep down the rabbit hole of tyranny right now.
[56:45.480 --> 56:48.520]  We are. I mean, we've watched this, we've watched this roll out. And the funny thing
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.400]  is they set everything up really with 9 11 in the fall in the wake of that. That's why
[56:52.400 --> 56:55.760]  for those, I say those of us that were awake, we saw what where this was going, we saw with
[56:55.760 --> 57:00.000]  a total information awareness was going to go as far as, you know, these, these, the
[57:00.000 --> 57:04.480]  social media, the use of the phones to surveil people. And then ultimately, I believe it's
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.200]  moving towards an AI that's ultimately going to determine, you know, who's infected with
[57:09.200 --> 57:15.640]  the virus of free thought. That's right. All you got to do is go to band.video, just
[57:15.640 --> 57:21.640]  the word band.video and right in the center at the top, the featured video is Ukraine
[57:21.640 --> 57:31.200]  on fire in the year 2022. Oliver Stone, multi-time top screenwriter, director, everything, his
[57:31.200 --> 57:38.920]  film, the director, all of it, censored in the United States of America. Unbelievable.
[57:38.920 --> 57:42.600]  He'll be right back. You know what George Orwell said, in a time of universal deceit
[57:42.600 --> 57:47.720]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act. I'm sure Oliver Stone is proud right now,
[57:47.720 --> 57:48.720]  though.
[57:48.720 --> 57:54.520]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great and full worth listeners
[57:54.520 --> 58:01.000]  and viewers. If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.720]  your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it
[58:05.720 --> 58:10.320]  will change your life. It will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone
[58:10.320 --> 58:15.800]  has iodine deficiency. Look into it for yourself. It's the opposite of fluoride. It's the good
[58:15.800 --> 58:22.040]  halogen. And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation. Now, a lot of our products
[58:22.040 --> 58:25.680]  have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns and supply chain
[58:25.680 --> 58:30.800]  breakouts. We were sold out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off. A lot
[58:30.800 --> 58:34.040]  of folks have been getting it. And I was thinking, you know what, I'm going to bring it back
[58:34.040 --> 58:38.600]  on sale again just until it sells out. Because even though we want maybe as much money in
[58:38.600 --> 58:42.680]  the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales
[58:42.680 --> 58:49.120]  in now to stay on air. See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[58:49.120 --> 58:54.520]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even
[58:54.520 --> 59:00.040]  though you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[59:00.040 --> 59:05.160]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[59:05.160 --> 59:11.160]  you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down. Protecting
[59:11.160 --> 59:15.080]  your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting

[1:00:21.720 --> 1:00:25.160]  All right, Sean Stones with us another 15 minutes and he's going to be in studio,
[1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:29.320]  hopefully, he gets a chance to come to Austin. He thinks he is next week on Monday or Tuesday,
[1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:34.200]  so look for that. But what a time to have him on. He's got a new great book and an amazing new
[1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:37.560]  film. We'll tell you about the next segment. This is a short little five minutes, some stations,
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:43.400]  join us next minute. But Sean, just pulling back, to me, it's so surreal to see all this
[1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:48.600]  happening and to see the censorship and the attacks and the blaming oil prices on Russia.
[1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:55.640]  I'm not lionizing Russia, but I mean, we know it's our own so-called leadership that is literally
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:59.880]  instigating all this. How do we walk that tightrope or where do you see this going?
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:05.880]  Yeah, it's, it's, it's Orwellian. It's, it's basically everything that we've talked about
[1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:10.920]  and worried about as far as the various agendas of, you know, totalitarian controls.
[1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:16.440]  By the way, Ukraine on fire and revealing Ukraine, my dad's documentaries, I think are also
[1:01:16.440 --> 1:01:23.400]  off Amazon now, which, which would indicate a higher level of pressure perhaps being put on,
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:27.960]  you know, the owners of Amazon. Yeah, folks that don't know Amazon doesn't usually,
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:32.200]  it's not as bad. Wow. Is this breaking that the films are off Amazon?
[1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:37.320]  I mean, I just looked it up. I can't find it there unless maybe your team can find it. I would
[1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:40.920]  check iTunes. I would check Amazon to see if they're actually still there in the prime sector.
[1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:44.680]  Maybe the DVD, you can get the DVD from Amazon, but as far as being on prime,
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:49.640]  it seems to be missing. So I would, maybe your team can look and, and ballot and verify that,
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:53.720]  but it would be indicative. Again, if something higher being pushed, you know,
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.840]  then just a Google. No, you're right. That's what they do. They,
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:00.360]  if they take you off prime and streaming first, they'll leave the DVD out, because that's happened
[1:02:00.360 --> 1:02:06.680]  to us. They took us off and let us sell the DVDs. Wow. That's a big deal. Yeah. It's interesting.
[1:02:06.680 --> 1:02:10.840]  But again, it's, it's, you know, selling well. So what, you know, where is it going? I mean,
[1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:17.720]  as far as what we can tell as far as the year, you know, the, the new world order design is to
[1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.480]  what is, you know, what does the World Economic Forum say about it? You know,
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:26.600]  they want everyone to basically own nothing to be renters. We saw last year with BlackRock
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:31.400]  buying up property houses, right? Things that keep basically keep, keep them off the market,
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:36.440]  keep the prices high basically for people that were affected, especially by the,
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:40.280]  the economic crisis. I did a documentary last year called the paradigm of money.
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:44.600]  I produce, which Robert David Steele executive produced, and the paradigm of money is very
[1:02:44.600 --> 1:02:49.720]  much about a lot of the shenanigans of all street and how they profit from the American people,
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:54.680]  such as the place where 1% of the economy now has more wealth than the entire middle class.
[1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:59.560]  I mean, that's huge news to come to, right? I mean, we thought 2008 was bad as far as
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:03.400]  the transfer of wealth that we saw in that time period. We focus on that in our documentary,
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:08.280]  but 2020 is even worse. We saw, you know, with the shutdowns and what was intentionally
[1:03:08.280 --> 1:03:12.280]  closed. So we have to realize, as you know, Alex, this is not a, this was never about
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:16.440]  science. This was never about health. This was about economics. This was about taking,
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:19.800]  shutting down small businesses, telling the middle middle class and business owners,
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:24.600]  you can't do business. Only Amazon and Walmart, the big global corporations can do business.
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:29.560]  We hate you, the middle class and the little people of America. Even though we tell you,
[1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.560]  yeah, we want a, you know, universal basic income, like that's really going to do much
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:38.920]  in what America stands for is this entrepreneurial middle class spirit, which we've seen targeted
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:43.400]  for the last decades really, you know, since the 70s, you could say, since the deindustrialization
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:47.640]  policies. And then Ukraine is the same story. I mean, Ukraine was deindustrialized the same way
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:53.160]  we have been. So really it's like all of these are being gobbled up by these international
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:57.800]  powers, banks, you know, big conglomerates connected to, you know, again, to Wall Street
[1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:03.720]  insiders. And it's, it's about, you know, the, the 1% and the 1% of the 1% eating up as much as
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:07.480]  they can and putting us into, and you're feeling more, making us feel more and more disempowered.
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:12.280]  That's the agenda. And, you know, I watched your dad's films when they came out and I've been
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:16.840]  intending to watch him again, but just watching the trailers reminds me he went and got Soros.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:23.160]  He had, he gave them all the same amount of time. So they go to interviews. He does a fair thing.
[1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:28.920]  People choose Russia's side because they're less evil than our leaders. And then they censor it
[1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:32.520]  when that's like when he went on 60 minutes and admitted he was a Nazi collaborator,
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:37.880]  and then he wants that video banned. He said that. So I love Soros' ego. He does the interviews
[1:04:37.880 --> 1:04:40.120]  and then doesn't like how they look. So he wants it banned.
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:46.360]  Well, my dad, my dad did, you know, at some levels, you know, certainly, I mean, my dad and
[1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:50.280]  Soros were on, were on agreement when it came to some legalization of marijuana policies,
[1:04:50.280 --> 1:04:54.760]  right? Stay there. Sean Stone, we're coming right back with Phil Maker bestselling author Sean Stone.
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:55.240]  Stay with us.
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:04.920]  Two of our bestselling products are back in stock. Then FullWarStore.com.
[1:05:04.920 --> 1:05:08.360]  And they will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in,
[1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:13.320]  if I sell it at full price. But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting
[1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:20.120]  one or son or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are. And I believe you will
[1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:25.720]  then get hooked on them like myself, my family and the crew are. So again, both these products are
[1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:32.840]  back in stock, both X3 and one or son, they are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:39.240]  sell out at this price I would estimate in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3
[1:05:39.240 --> 1:05:43.080]  and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:48.040]  quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're amazing and they're at
[1:05:48.040 --> 1:05:54.280]  FullWarStore.com. And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run
[1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:58.440]  the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:14.360]  Leading up frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:14.360 --> 1:06:21.160]  What have I told you? Baby, I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight.
[1:06:21.160 --> 1:06:31.400]  What have I told you 10 years ago that in the year 2022 on March 10th, Oliver Stone,
[1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:38.040]  who's got more Academy Awards than you can imagine, who is a trailblazer, what Hollywood wishes it was
[1:06:39.160 --> 1:06:44.440]  is having his film, films taken off YouTube, taken everywhere where he's giving them out for free,
[1:06:45.480 --> 1:06:49.960]  Ukraine on fire, and then the newest film, all because they don't want you to know the real
[1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:55.080]  players and what's really going on. Folks, this is the canary in the coal mine. Trump was hated
[1:06:55.080 --> 1:07:02.040]  and polarized. Alex Jones hated and polarized by some. Loved by many. You can still like do that.
[1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:09.720]  It's horrible. But when you start banning classical liberal darlings who are actually liberal in
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:14.040]  anti-war and actually want to go find out what's going on, like his dad was in Vietnam,
[1:07:14.040 --> 1:07:18.200]  went there and thought later it was wrong, which it was. Look at Vietnam today. They love us. They
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:23.000]  hate China. Why do we give them business deals like Ho Chi Minh asked? Oliver Stone was right.
[1:07:23.560 --> 1:07:28.680]  But so was his son, best-selling author, researcher, Sean Stone. And we'll tell you about his book and
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:32.840]  film before he leaves. This will be in studio hopefully with us next week. But, well,
[1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:37.960]  Sean, just continuing here with all the things that are happening. Where do you think this is
[1:07:37.960 --> 1:07:44.520]  going? What are your big concerns? What's your wish list? Because I've got children. I've got family.
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.880]  I don't want to have a nuclear war. And now they're saying Russia's going to launch a chemical
[1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:51.080]  attack. They're going to launch a bio attack. And Russia goes, no, that's going to be a false flag.
[1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:58.520]  And there's this fog of war, but you can sense the danger. I can palpably feel more danger than
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:04.040]  I've ever felt in my life and my gut's never wrong. Yeah. I mean, we saw it. We saw it right away.
[1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:09.240]  The Russians have been very tactical. You know, they went, they got Chernobyl right away, which,
[1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:14.840]  by the way, I'm told off the record, they may have been, we know about the biolabs now, right?
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:19.400]  This has sort of come out. We discussed a little bit less on Sunday, but it seems to be coming
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:23.960]  more and more. Victoria Newly acknowledged it. You know that Obama was part of installing it
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:28.920]  there. So the Russians do about the biolabs. But they also were worried about nuclear proliferation,
[1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:33.960]  as I mentioned on the show on Sunday. And I do, there was concern that it was being developed at
[1:08:33.960 --> 1:08:40.440]  Chernobyl, actually, as being an area where this potential nuclear weaponry technology,
[1:08:40.440 --> 1:08:43.720]  dirty bomb technology was being developed. So that's why the Russians went for Chernobyl first.
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:48.280]  When they got hold of the other nuclear plants, what did we see? Basically, there were some,
[1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:51.880]  they were trying to create false flags. Ukrainians and the U.P. there, backers in NATO, were trying
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:57.080]  to create false flags of blowing up, burning a nuclear power plant, blaming it on the Russians.
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:01.400]  Well, the Russians seem to have secured those. So now what is going on? As the Russians, the
[1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:05.240]  Chinese and others are saying, hey, America, answer for what the heck you were doing with these
[1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:10.840]  weapons, these biological weaponry, you know, in Ukraine. Now we're saying, oh, it's the Russians
[1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:14.680]  that are going to do it. It's the Russians that did it. It's all fake, right? And the Russians
[1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:21.320]  attack hospitals when we know the Nazi battalions are so dumb, they've been tweeting their geolocation.
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:25.000]  We know they kicked everybody out of the hospitals. I don't just believe Russian propaganda. I went
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.600]  and looked it up. They are using hospitals and schools as human shields. Exactly. I mean, this
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:35.720]  is, this is just like, it's basic understanding of tactics and the Russian psychology towards this.
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:40.920]  You know, the Russians have not gone in there and bombed the Kiev like, like we did Baghdad.
[1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:46.680]  It's been very limited targets, very strategic. So I mean, we're just, it's just amazing that
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:51.400]  people buy the BS from the same people that sold them weapons of mass destruction in Iraq,
[1:09:51.400 --> 1:09:57.560]  that sold them all these wars in Syria and Syria and Libya and, you know, Afghanistan and Iraq.
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:01.560]  Oh, yeah. The Associated Press and New York Times are asking, what's Putin's next target?
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:06.280]  Well, does he have like eight countries on his belt like we do now? Exactly. Exactly.
[1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:10.760]  These people are just professional prostitutes and it's amazing that anyone even gives them credit.
[1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:14.760]  I do think, I think a lot of people are waking up quickly. I do have optimism.
[1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:19.480]  People have caught on to the alternative media pretty well outside of maybe the LA, New York.
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:22.520]  But I mean, come on, if you, you know, people are sitting there with, you know, with six,
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:27.320]  with three jabs at this point, ready to get, you know, three more, you know, they don't have a brain.
[1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:32.520]  I'm sorry. At this point when I heard, by the way, is this true that Pfizer is being unlisted
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.560]  from the stock exchange? They're all in trouble. So is Moderna. Yeah. Big rumblings. It's coming
[1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:42.520]  out that they're, they really bit off more than they could shoot. Right. I mean, I think this is
[1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:46.600]  really where the story is. And so, yeah, the psychopaths that run the world, they got, you
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:51.320]  got to watch Best Kept Secret, my docuseries. It's really shows the psychology of the psychopath.
[1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:54.600]  Yeah. Where do people find that David Ike's distributing it? Where do we find it on your
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:00.680]  website? Seanstone.info. Yeah, that he can connect to it. The links are there on Seanstone.info.
[1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:04.280]  I'd love to get on info wars, obviously. We are. We're going to carry it best kept secret.
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.560]  And then also the book, New World Order, a strategy of imperialism.
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:13.400]  For people, we're not blaming English people because I'm part British. If I wasn't part
[1:11:13.400 --> 1:11:18.120]  British, I still wouldn't blame them. But it's the British empire model being used by corporations
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:20.840]  for global domination. Even a great job laying that out your book.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:25.560]  Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So that's, that's where we are. We're in a place where half the half
[1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:30.840]  the American population is, is gone. The other half is, I think, awake. And, you know, the real,
[1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:34.440]  the real war is going to be here. This is the place because it's not about physical war. It's
[1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:39.640]  spiritual. It's, it's an awakening. It states taking their rights back, claiming their sovereignty
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.680]  from a, from a. Sean, let's talk big picture. Yeah. Why are the globalists upset? Why are
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:48.920]  they starting wars? Why are they releasing bio weapons? What is this spiritual revolution you
[1:11:48.920 --> 1:11:53.400]  talk about? What's happening? Yeah. Well, it's, it's end game. I mean, it's just, it's really
[1:11:53.400 --> 1:11:57.880]  the end game that you talked about a long time ago coming. We're there now. It's the place when
[1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:02.600]  people start to see through the lies, the deception, it becomes so overt and so clear.
[1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:07.320]  And states start to claim their rights and say, you know what, maybe we don't want to be part of
[1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:12.200]  this system anymore. Maybe we need to go back to our constitution and the principles of states'
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:16.360]  rights against, again, I say totalitarian federal government. I mean, this is, this is
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:21.400]  literally an illegal regime that has been put upon us. This is not an elected government.
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:26.840]  And, you know, the swamp of Washington has been corrupt for a long time. Trump's revolution was
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.920]  waking people up to that saying, Hey, we can actually do something about it. We can actually
[1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:35.080]  start to claim our rights again. And we can, you know, we can have hope and optimism. And as
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.720]  opposed to this feeling of despair that we had the one new old order regime after another,
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:44.920]  basically just taking away our freedoms, our liberties, our values. I think it's people have
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:49.160]  said, we're drawing a line in the sand. This is it. We have to stand on certain principles
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:53.640]  of what it means to be a patriotic American. And that's, that's where I think half the country is.
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:58.120]  I totally agree. They're, the globalists are doing this out of weakness and
[1:12:58.120 --> 1:13:02.360]  nation states aren't perfect. Our governments aren't perfect. But they were constituted by us.
[1:13:02.360 --> 1:13:05.960]  And this global corporate system wants to blame governments for all the problems,
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:10.520]  wipe those out. And now we've got anarchy and warlords controlled by the big bankers
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:16.760]  where now they've only got one person to talk to per region versus the people. And so that's why
[1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:20.760]  they're waging war against the nation state. That's why the nation state is going to be the firewall
[1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:26.360]  against that tyranny. Exactly. The nation state is the principle that we have. It's basically it's
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:29.880]  also coming back to the nation, the state, the state's rights, you know, the principles of,
[1:13:29.880 --> 1:13:35.080]  you know, having states that said no to, you know, you name it, federal mandates, federal, you know,
[1:13:35.080 --> 1:13:37.960]  yeah, you can't just take over our federal government. Now you're going to take over all
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:43.160]  the parts. So the founders, as you know, said that separation of powers divide everything up so
[1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:47.720]  dictators can't get control. Exactly. And that's as they're going to try to roll out digital IDs
[1:13:47.720 --> 1:13:52.120]  next, you know, because their vaccine mandates are falling apart and the lies around the vaccines
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:55.560]  are coming out. Oh, so the digital ID is the next step. Well, again, a lot of states are said,
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:00.040]  you know what, we're tired of being lied to by you guys. We've had enough and we just, we don't
[1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:04.520]  want to be part of this. Well, isn't Florida amazing saying don't give children shots. It
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:10.360]  hurts them. Stop wearing the mask. It's theater. I mean, DeSantis has gone from awesome to fantastic.
[1:14:10.360 --> 1:14:14.920]  There's no way he's not for real. In my view, with what he's doing, that guy is awesome.
[1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:20.280]  It takes courage. It takes courage to not be bought. As we see most people are bought. They're
[1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:26.040]  bought. They've become robots. They've become bots, you know, it's too easy to give into a system
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:30.680]  where there's so much money. As I said earlier, you know, 1% has more wealth in the entire middle
[1:14:30.680 --> 1:14:35.320]  class. You know, people like Gates with their tens of billions of dollars and people say, well,
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:39.480]  I don't understand how, how all these people can agree. Well, guess what? If you buy them, if you
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:43.240]  buy the education system, that's a new world order. My book is about is how controlled the
[1:14:43.240 --> 1:14:47.320]  education system has been, how much breeding, I mean, how much grooming goes on. You don't get to
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:51.800]  be at the top of CNN without being groomed. Are you kidding me? I mean, real journalists quit.
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.520]  You know, that's what they did. Exactly. All right. Are you going to be able to make it in
[1:14:54.520 --> 1:15:00.280]  studio next week? Yeah, I'm there Tuesday in town. I'd love to come. All right. Then you're in
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:06.200]  studio. How about third hour Tuesday in studio? Let's do it. Let's nail it down. All right,
[1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:13.000]  Sean Stone, thank you so much. But I mean, it is a little surreal. Oliver Stone movies banned
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:17.800]  off YouTube and now it looks like Amazon. I mean, that is a real bellwether. I got to tell you.
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:20.600]  I mean, if the, you think the average leftist is going to agree with that now?
[1:15:22.440 --> 1:15:26.440]  You know, my leftists have abandoned my father in many ways, you know, because they've gone to
[1:15:26.440 --> 1:15:30.920]  the pro-war, you know, anti-Russia Cold War hysteria. These, you know, the left. Well,
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:37.480]  I mean, your dad with Conan and with Scarface and with what apocalypse now, right? I mean,
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:43.160]  just everything. Your dad's everywhere. JFK. I mean, I guess we have to ban those too. All right,
[1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:46.920]  Sean Stone, thank you so much. Great job, brother. You got it. Thank you.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:51.000]  Sean Stone.info and he's been a lot of great work himself. Go check it out. But I mean,
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:56.200]  this is getting ridiculous, folks. Now Oliver Stone's getting banned. I mean, what the hell?
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:05.160]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February,
[1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:12.200]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, X3. That has all three types
[1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:19.240]  of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body,
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:24.280]  your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of the population in the
[1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:30.360]  world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So we had on sale 50% off,
[1:16:30.360 --> 1:16:35.160]  but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long time. So I took
[1:16:35.160 --> 1:16:40.600]  it back to full process. I was just thinking, you know what, we need to funds in now to stay on air.
[1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:45.240]  Plus, this is the right product everybody needs. So to incentivize folks out there that have been
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:49.880]  on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it
[1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:57.000]  at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:04.760]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they
[1:17:04.760 --> 1:17:10.600]  should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com. Before I set out
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:16.040]  on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know,
[1:17:16.040 --> 1:17:21.640]  besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:26.920]  healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the
[1:17:26.920 --> 1:17:32.040]  best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones
[1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:37.800]  sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support
[1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:43.560]  they need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:48.520]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to
[1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:53.560]  take out a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:59.960]  for every day and sore list can keep you moving and feeling great at any age. I stay on air
[1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:05.560]  selling high quality products that you need that you want that you're going to be happy with.
[1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:10.840]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again. It's a symbiotic relationship. I promote
[1:18:10.840 --> 1:18:15.960]  liberty. I promote freedom. I fight the globalist and I'm able to do that because you buy products
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:20.600]  and then foreshore.com and listen, all the products are great. But when it comes to high quality
[1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:27.400]  storeable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute
[1:18:27.400 --> 1:18:33.000]  360 win a no brainer and they've got high quality storeable food ready to ship to you right now.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:38.520]  The great folks at my patron supply exclusively prepare with alex.com discounted. So again,
[1:18:38.520 --> 1:18:43.640]  beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war. The only way you lose is not taking action
[1:18:43.640 --> 1:18:49.960]  at infowarstore.com or prepare with alex.com right now. This is high quality storeable food.
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.440]  This is how you beat inflation. Get yours today. It's ready to ship. But I wouldn't wait because
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:58.920]  prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding. With the world awakening, I think
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:02.840]  it's important that we rise to prevent them right now, take advantage of this moment and I have all
[1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:06.840]  of an idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful
[1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:11.800]  and effective for us to, you know, hang banners over highways. Imagine a giant bean or a piece of
[1:19:11.800 --> 1:19:18.520]  that. It says Alex Jones is right. We stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever. Brother,
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:23.960]  I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in your small town or your big city
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:28.760]  to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:33.640]  over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you recommend people say on these banner
[1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:38.920]  hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, health, justice, ways to form, not farm, rest out, rest
[1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:43.240]  while swab. The vaccine is poison. There's tons of things. I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:19:43.240 --> 1:19:48.280]  Don't agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates. The COVID backs is poison. Beautiful. Yeah,
[1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:52.040]  there's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be effective. That's what I'm calling
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:56.920]  about. God bless you, Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you
[1:19:56.920 --> 1:20:12.840]  so much. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:31.720]  You know, I love America, but it's been hijacked by very evil globalists. Let's hit some of these
[1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:39.800]  big headlines. We'll get our next guest who wasn't annoying, but almost annoying in the last eight,
[1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:46.280]  nine, 10 years of interviewing. Warning of the nuclear war being triggered in Ukraine and the
[1:20:46.280 --> 1:20:54.040]  whole globalist program was built around that. We just had Sean Stone on about Ukraine on fire
[1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:57.880]  now being censored, Oliver Stone's film being taken offline. Look at some of these headlines.
[1:20:57.880 --> 1:21:02.440]  We could put today's full show headline up. I think it says it all. It's a big deal.
[1:21:02.440 --> 1:21:11.800]  And really front and center for me is this. Global emergency broadcast is live. Globalist
[1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:19.160]  backed Ukraine orders Russia to surrender. Intel shows New World Order forces preparing
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:24.760]  to launch false flag biochemical radiological attack. And you see the pre-programming. Oh,
[1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:28.840]  Russia's going to release a bio weapon. Russia's going to release a chemical weapon. Russia's going
[1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:34.760]  to blow up a nuclear plant. You've all seen that. And you've got the head of the UN program,
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:41.720]  Dr. Ryan, of the emergency response saying, we know a bio event's about to happen from the sick
[1:21:41.720 --> 1:21:49.320]  people that are all together. So they're already putting the cover story out that a wet market,
[1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:55.400]  a grocery store released COVID-19. Now they're telling you that, oh, it's not the jungles of
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:59.240]  Africa that are going to give us the virus. They're going to kill everybody, as we've been told. No,
[1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:04.040]  it's Ukraine. It's people in basements. That's clip is coming up next segment.
[1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:09.400]  And I wouldn't check this. I don't just believe the Daily Mail. I wouldn't check the Russians
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:15.560]  put this out so the Ukrainians. Ukraine war. Kiev demands Russia capitulate, which in the
[1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:20.520]  actual translation is surrender. That's what capitulate means. A head of talks in Turkey
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:27.160]  would labor off today, because they know they're backed by the West. House passes 1.5 trillion
[1:22:27.160 --> 1:22:34.360]  spending bill with 13.6 billion for Ukraine. Putin begins to move on Kiev. Russian tank
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:39.960]  columns repelled. Other top commander killed. Devastating ambush as Moscow's forces move
[1:22:39.960 --> 1:22:47.640]  within a few miles. No off ramps. US European officials don't see a clear in game in Ukraine,
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:53.400]  says the State Department. Yeah, I think so. Majority of Americans.
[1:22:55.800 --> 1:23:02.360]  62% believe it's Biden's fault. But don't you mean the people that control
[1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:09.240]  Biden? And then this clip will play it next segment. Putin's trying to bait a trap. No,
[1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:13.640]  he's actually gone into the trap in my view. But don't worry. Sean Penn has got an IQ
[1:23:13.640 --> 1:23:20.120]  below room temperature. I don't say it with pleasure. It's true. He's over there trying to get
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:28.280]  a no fly zone and mix, which will cause nuclear war. You dumb bastard. Ukrainian nationals attempt
[1:23:28.280 --> 1:23:31.800]  to cut power to Chernobyl. Russia claims what they've been doing the whole time. What are you
[1:23:31.800 --> 1:23:39.160]  talking about? A tip to they did it. Moscow responds to the maternity clinic. It says the
[1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:43.960]  Azov battalion was there. Well, I don't just believe the Russians. They were putting it out on
[1:23:43.960 --> 1:23:48.360]  Twitter and Instagram and on CNN where they were bragging they've taken over the hospitals and
[1:23:48.360 --> 1:23:54.920]  other facilities as human shields. Then we've got the bio lab news, which I've got a whole
[1:23:54.920 --> 1:24:03.080]  file on of our own corporate media bragging how Obama built the labs with deadly pathogens.
[1:24:03.080 --> 1:24:09.960]  And what a hero he was for doing it. I don't listen to anything the Russians say. I go off
[1:24:09.960 --> 1:24:13.640]  where they admit they were doing it themselves. Lee Strayer in a hand joins us.
[1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:18.040]  Lee's a syndicated radio host, author, researcher. He's worked for Breitmauer.
[1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:23.960]  He's worked for the Huffington Post. He's worked for them all. So he's here with us.
[1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:30.920]  I know you're a micro guy, but I want to do the macro here, a 35,000 foot view.
[1:24:30.920 --> 1:24:34.680]  What's currently happening? What is going to happen next? Because you're the guy that's been
[1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:42.920]  harping on Ukraine for over a decade. Well, so I think I'll put it like this. I wonder if the day
[1:24:42.920 --> 1:24:48.600]  after Eisenhower's military industrial complex speech, people understood the significance
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:53.720]  where they just seen. Does that make sense? I don't think so. I think they saw the Fairwell
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:57.400]  address and they were like, oh, that was interesting. And they commented about his tie or something.
[1:24:57.400 --> 1:25:05.640]  What we saw yesterday, Victoria Newland on TV in front of Congress admitted to Marco Rubio
[1:25:06.280 --> 1:25:13.400]  that there are biolabs in Ukraine, that the significance of that moment, that's a clip
[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:19.480]  that's going to be repeated for decades. You're going to see it in videos that people make themselves
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:23.800]  because you're not going to see it much from the mainstream media. God bless Tucker Carlson.
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:28.520]  I'll say that. He did a good segment on it last night, but then it was immediately followed by
[1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:35.240]  Hannity, almost point counterpoint, saying, no, no, no, I ignore this. This is a big deal
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:43.000]  because let's point over what happened in a macro sense here. In 2014, the United States overthrew
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  a democratically elected government because not that they were pro-Russia, but because they were
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:56.040]  neutral. And a few big things came out of that. Number one, we built bioweapons labs there,
[1:25:56.600 --> 1:26:02.920]  which by the way is why we attacked Iraq was because we thought we lied. We didn't think it.
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:09.240]  You know that. We lied and said they had bioweapons and said that's reason enough to invade them
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:15.000]  and kill a million people. That's what happened there. Now, the other thing that happened was
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:21.240]  that government, Petro Poroshenko, the guy who eventually was a leader, was used to try to keep
[1:26:21.240 --> 1:26:25.960]  Donald Trump from getting elected in 2016. You and I have talked about that many times.
[1:26:27.400 --> 1:26:32.120]  Ukraine was right at the center of Russiagate. So after we overthrew the government,
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:40.440]  biolabs, Russiagate, and now the propaganda campaign, because see the other thing
[1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:47.400]  that I think is so significant. It's not just about the biolabs. It's that we had a solid
[1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:55.640]  intense week. And when I say intense, in the paper, USA Today, Business Insider saying,
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:02.280]  no, no, the biolab stories, crazy tinfoil hat. Oh yeah, this is the biggest blow up in your face
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.880]  ever. Thousands of articles saying it's insane. There are no labs period. Yeah, we run labs.
[1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:12.520]  They're deadly weapons. Yeah. I mean, they had to totally about face and now say Russia is going
[1:27:12.520 --> 1:27:16.840]  to release bioweapons. So they don't just about face and they go, there are biolabs and it's the
[1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:24.440]  Russians. That's that's right. And so in other words, you call the biggest blow up in their face.
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:33.560]  I agree. But it's coming on a series of blobs in their face. What is COVID-19? We've seen that
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:39.880]  over and over again. In the past couple of years, that things they were pushing is propaganda.
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:45.640]  Everybody's seeing it right now. Oh, yeah, the internal Democrats top national strategy
[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:49.960]  meaning where the Democrats called themselves cursed. They even know they're cursed.
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.080]  Yes, and they may literally be cursed. But let's leave that spiritual stuff aside for the time
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:08.440]  being. But no, but this is such a major propaganda loss for the US. And I'll put it like this,
[1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:13.160]  whether the American public picks up on this and whether the American news media picks up on it,
[1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:21.960]  they won't. China, the morning that New Lin said this is showing that they are taking this seriously.
[1:28:21.960 --> 1:28:26.040]  They're not going to drop it. And do you think Putin's going to drop it? No way.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.440]  How do we look to the rest of the world? Think about this. Think about how we look to other
[1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:36.680]  countries. That's not going to go well. So I know you're one of the smartest guys on this,
[1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:40.440]  I know. So we need to just dumb it down for us when we come back and we need to lay out
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:43.960]  what's currently happening, what you think's about to happen and what we can do to stop
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.840]  World War Three. Because my spidey sense is always, you know, tingling with my God. It's
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:58.440]  like I got a, you know, a cattle prod shoved up my rear end here. I mean, I am really upset right now.
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:24.360]  Your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of the population of the
[1:29:24.360 --> 1:29:30.440]  world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine out there. So we have on self 50% off,
[1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:35.320]  but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come in for a long time? So I took it
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:39.960]  back to full products. And I was just thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay
[1:29:39.960 --> 1:29:45.160]  on air. Plus this is the right product everybody needs. So incentivize folks out there that have
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:49.880]  been on the fence, get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it
[1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:57.000]  at 50% off until it sells out. Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:29:59.160 --> 1:30:04.600]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock, infowarstore.com. And they will sell out in the
[1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:09.480]  next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price. But I want
[1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:15.080]  those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son or getting X3 to try the
[1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:20.360]  products and see how amazing they are. And I believe you will then get hooked on them like
[1:30:20.360 --> 1:30:26.200]  myself and my family and the crew are. So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3
[1:30:26.200 --> 1:30:33.000]  and one or son, they are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:38.760]  I would estimate in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good
[1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:43.240]  halogens versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3
[1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:48.120]  with vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're amazing and they're at infowarstore.com.
[1:30:48.120 --> 1:30:53.880]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run the operation.
[1:30:53.880 --> 1:30:57.080]  You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[1:30:58.280 --> 1:31:04.600]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier
[1:31:04.600 --> 1:31:09.160]  life. Infowars has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a
[1:31:09.160 --> 1:31:14.680]  supplement that contains both. This infowar's life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:19.480]  hips should be your next purchase from the infowar store. The rose hips contained within
[1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:25.000]  are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:30.280]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:35.640]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:40.680]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:45.880]  nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that
[1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:51.240]  intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:56.760]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rose hips
[1:31:56.760 --> 1:32:04.360]  don't lie. There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:32:04.360 --> 1:32:12.360]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real study
[1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:17.960]  of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that basically
[1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:24.360]  control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into, say, the Anglo-American
[1:32:24.360 --> 1:32:28.040]  establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission of the United
[1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:34.520]  Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until 10 years ago, the media said
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:38.760]  the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group, didn't exist. Well, now the Bilderberg
[1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:44.600]  group is public in its former head, still on the steering committee, is called Schwab, and he has
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:49.960]  set up the great reset in global government. And as a Liberty movement worldwide, we don't address
[1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:55.000]  the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.680]  We don't have a shot. When you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:36.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:44.200]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[1:33:44.200 --> 1:33:46.680]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:55.400]  My goal is human expansion.
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:34:02.120]  Lee Stranahan joins us to get a talk show host, author, citizenjournalistschool.com,
[1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:06.440]  citizenjournalistschool.com. All right, Lee, you're always back running. You're a great,
[1:34:06.440 --> 1:34:10.520]  great guest. You always go to this person, that person, and it always turns out to be
[1:34:10.520 --> 1:34:14.760]  super accurate. But just a big picture. Talk to me like I'm five years old, because my audience
[1:34:14.760 --> 1:34:19.000]  isn't five. They're not dumb, but they want big picture here to still knowledge, because you
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:23.720]  are a Ukraine expert. My God, you harp on it. That's mainly what you do. You know all the players
[1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:29.000]  you were talking about before, even the overthrow in 2008. So you've been over the target.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:36.520]  My question to you is, why did Putin invade? Why is Ukraine so in calcitrant,
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:42.280]  saying Russia should surrender? What is the level of these bio labs? What's all the hype,
[1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:48.840]  obviously, around Russia's going to stage a biological attack, radiological or chemical?
[1:34:48.840 --> 1:34:54.520]  Obviously, that's the setup. The media is preparing that. We'd have to be idiots to not see that.
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:58.680]  Russia does not have a reason to use that. That turns the world against them. It's the last thing
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:03.960]  we ever do. Kind of like Syria 2.0 and Obama's red lines. Where is all this going?
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:11.960]  Well, okay. So first off, if everybody watching will understand when I say there are bigger
[1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:17.320]  issues at play here, and you could see that with that woman who is the Ukrainian member of parliament
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:21.800]  who came out on Fox News and said, we're fighting to protect the new world already. Remember her?
[1:35:22.360 --> 1:35:28.200]  So those are the bigger issues. But let's be very specific on what Putin wants. We don't need to
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:34.440]  guess what Putin wants. He did a number of very clear speeches on this. Number one, he wanted to
[1:35:34.440 --> 1:35:42.680]  stop the expansion of NATO, which is getting right up into Russia with the move into Ukraine.
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:47.240]  That's Russia's backyard, literally. Yeah, we would never put up with Russian troops in Toronto
[1:35:48.120 --> 1:35:56.760]  or in the border with Texas. And we shouldn't. It's crazy. So part of what's going on here is
[1:35:56.760 --> 1:36:01.720]  he wants that. Now, here's what's ironic about it. They were never going to get into NATO.
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:08.200]  So countries like Germany, they won't even let them in the EU. So in other words, the US pushed
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:13.720]  this war, said we're not going to meet your demands. And one of the demands was something
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:20.520]  that that was not going to happen. Ukraine and even Zelensky has come out and said he's skeptical
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:26.200]  of NATO now because he's seeing that he's being pushed into this by the US. So what's going to
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:34.680]  happen is Vladimir Putin will not stop until the mission is accomplished. He's been very clear on
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:43.080]  that. And the mission is demilitarizing Ukraine. I think it's very clear right now, first off, that
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:51.000]  Russia has just in terms of the numbers of vastly superior, much bigger military in terms of weapons
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:56.440]  and stuff like that. It's a much better military. And I've interviewed people like ex-Marine Scott
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.640]  Ritter, the UN Weapons Inspector, and he's adamant on this. He also points out that Russia
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:05.960]  with conventional weapons can level the major cities in about 10 hours. They don't want to
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:10.920]  destroy the infrastructure. They want to create a neutral zone in between. So people think that
[1:37:10.920 --> 1:37:15.720]  Russia is losing. That's because Russia has had extremely soft touch here.
[1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:22.440]  No, that's right, because they're not trying to kill civilians. And I will say one of the things,
[1:37:22.440 --> 1:37:27.960]  just to sort of tie in, I don't want to get off on it. But I think it's significant that
[1:37:28.520 --> 1:37:33.400]  Vladimir Putin is a Christian. I actually think it's one of the reasons they hate him and demonize
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:39.960]  him. He took a country that was the second biggest atheist nation on the face of the earth,
[1:37:39.960 --> 1:37:47.960]  and is now a blatant of valor. That's right. Christ said you judge a tree by its fruits.
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:52.120]  And whether you trust Putin or not, there's a giant Christian revival happening in Russia.
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:58.520]  Yes. And I think there's reasons. And when I mentioned that Ukrainian MP in the no world order,
[1:37:58.520 --> 1:38:02.760]  Putin obviously knows that because this is a guy, you know, you and I can talk about
[1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:11.160]  George Soros and we do. But he threw through he threw Soros out. Putin said no more George Soros
[1:38:11.160 --> 1:38:17.320]  in 2015. He gets the big issues here. And by the way, even right wing regimes like Orban have
[1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:23.640]  agreed and thrown Soros out. No, and they're right from his native country. Soros is hungry.
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:29.720]  Yes, exactly right. And that's why people like Orban, who's on the right. And by the way,
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:35.160]  Putin's on the right. He's an anti-communist. He was, you know, when the Soviet Union.
[1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:38.840]  Yeah, what did you make of that speech before he invaded three weeks ago? He said,
[1:38:39.720 --> 1:38:43.880]  you know, we're Christian and we hate communists and Lenin was wrong to give Ukraine away because
[1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:49.160]  it was part of Russia. And he just he denounced communism. He said, we're going to decommunize
[1:38:49.800 --> 1:38:55.160]  Eastern Europe. So get ready. And then and then right wingers can't believe this is happening.
[1:38:55.160 --> 1:39:03.640]  They just they're like, oh, it's a fake thing. Well, here's the thing. If you know, you you've
[1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:09.080]  been talking and you and I've been talking about the danger of the deep state for a long time. And
[1:39:09.080 --> 1:39:14.520]  we know it goes back decades. If you're going to take on the deep state, they're not puppies.
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:22.040]  These are liars, right? And they have a military, the deep state, the CIA and stuff like that have
[1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:28.280]  a military. I think Putin is doing the work that journalists like you and I can't do because we
[1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:33.560]  don't have an army. We may have an army of info warriors, but he has tanks and planes.
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:41.000]  And to do what he's doing and to do it the way he's doing and the reason I mentioned is Christianity
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:47.640]  is because I think he's and this this will blow some people's minds. But I think he's conducting
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:55.480]  the war in a very Christian way. In other words, he's trying to avoid civilian casualties. He's
[1:39:55.480 --> 1:40:03.640]  saying what he's going to do before he does it. He again wars bad. We all agree on that war's horrible.
[1:40:04.200 --> 1:40:10.680]  And innocent people do die in wars. We know that. But this latest story about the maternity hospital
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:18.120]  shows that Zelensky, who's spoken, there's video on YouTube of Klaus Schwab introducing him. They're
[1:40:18.120 --> 1:40:24.440]  very clear on this. That MP, she's been to the Davos crowd. She's spoken to them. She's not using
[1:40:24.440 --> 1:40:29.880]  the term New World Order because she doesn't speak a well English. She knows exactly what she's talking
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:38.840]  about. This I think is Putin versus the worldwide deep state, the New World Order with a military.
[1:40:38.840 --> 1:40:45.320]  Think about that. And he's not going to stop. He's surrounded the military strategy they've done.
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:52.760]  I'm not a military guy. I'm blind in one eye, so I couldn't qualify. But they're surrounding cities
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:59.720]  and they're not and they're leaving humanitarian corridors. They're trying to help civilians
[1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:05.560]  get out. The people stopping them from getting out are the Ukrainians. Well, that's on Russia. Now,
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:10.760]  let me ask you this question. Why did Putin finally invade? What was the trigger? The bioweapon labs?
[1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:14.200]  Zelensky saying he wanted nukes. What finally pushed him in?
[1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:19.800]  I think it was the nukes comment from Zelensky. But I'll think what else is coming out now.
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:27.080]  There is evidence that it seems like Russia had that Ukraine was planning a big offensive
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:32.200]  in that eastern part of Ukraine, Donbass, where they are doing ethnic cleansing.
[1:41:32.200 --> 1:41:39.480]  Sure. They openly been talking about that. And they were literally, there's documentation coming
[1:41:39.480 --> 1:41:45.400]  out now. They were preparing a very big offensive. So in other words, Putin in order to stop that
[1:41:45.400 --> 1:41:54.120]  offensive in Donbass had to go in. And that's what I think. Well, I think the bio labs and I think
[1:41:54.120 --> 1:42:00.520]  the nukes comment were factors. But now we know that there was an imminent military attack happening.
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:04.760]  Well, what do you make of 60 plus percent of Americans basically agreeing with Putin and
[1:42:04.760 --> 1:42:09.320]  blaming Biden? That's got to really worry the deep state. I mean, they no one buys anything they say
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:16.440]  now. And when I talk to people, if I talk to people who are liberally loving people, right,
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:21.880]  and I mentioned I work for Sputnik and I talk about Putin, I get this reaction a lot. They
[1:42:21.880 --> 1:42:26.040]  kind of lean over and whisper and they go, you know, don't tell anyone, but I kind of like Putin.
[1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:32.440]  And they did. And I think, do you think that the media would ever reveal that a lot of mainstream
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:41.160]  Americans see that Putin is a leader who loves his country is promoting family values is not this
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:48.120]  crazy maniac that they try to make them out to be. But is they don't want people to know that a lot
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:53.560]  of people kind of like Putin. Now, that's certainly true. And look, you can't say and have babies
[1:42:53.560 --> 1:43:01.720]  and be Christian. You can't fake that by saying it's real. So I did it. I signed up for the Austin
[1:43:01.720 --> 1:43:07.080]  Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they should be. But thank goodness for prayer
[1:43:07.080 --> 1:43:12.760]  and thank goodness for info wars store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some
[1:43:12.760 --> 1:43:18.600]  turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force,
[1:43:18.600 --> 1:43:23.240]  it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential
[1:43:23.240 --> 1:43:28.600]  B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:34.920]  the training. And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones solar less. I have bad joints. Thanks,
[1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:39.480]  mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus
[1:43:39.480 --> 1:43:45.240]  inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast
[1:43:45.240 --> 1:43:49.880]  so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[1:43:49.880 --> 1:43:54.920]  good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day
[1:43:54.920 --> 1:44:01.080]  and solar less can keep you moving and feeling great at any age. I am a worldly person, meaning
[1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:05.640]  I like going to ball games. I like going to concerts. I like going to play golf. I like
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:11.480]  going out to dinner. I like the metropolitan life. I like everything that comes with this. But see,
[1:44:12.040 --> 1:44:17.800]  I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:23.320]  out of major metropolitan areas. Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:27.320]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods,
[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:31.320]  just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land? That's the
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:35.640]  survival instinct. But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me
[1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:40.280]  says, no, no, no, no, no, stay in the city. The survival instinct says, get the hell out of
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:44.200]  anywhere they've ever noticed that you need to get a vaccine or a mask. That's the, that's the
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:50.200]  internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well. But you can at
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:55.320]  least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies. And so we have the best ones at
[1:44:55.320 --> 1:45:16.280]  InfowarsStore.com. William, in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled. I agree. How do you make the sleeper awaken, William? Oh, hi, Alice. Thanks for taking my call. Can I plug
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:44.280]  you in, Alice, real quick? Yeah, go ahead. Hey, I'm in my sixties. And I did the work of 25, 30 year olds, and I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why. And I've tested this and I've taken your B12. And let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do. I take that B12 and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I did some pretty heavy work with the highway department. And my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70, I'm going to do that.
[1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:50.280]  I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:30.280]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:45.280]  wear for the people you'll be families in your next two months and you'll be developing your best brand of food.
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:49.640]  We have special dry bags, we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops,
[1:46:49.640 --> 1:46:51.160]  we've got them for iPads.

[1:47:00.040 --> 1:47:30.000]  Being a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:34.200]  Everything is going according to plan, Sasha.
[1:47:34.200 --> 1:47:40.400]  That's what Putin has said, I wish none of this would have happened.
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:44.480]  The NATO has been expanding, Soros has been trying to overthrow Russia.
[1:47:44.480 --> 1:47:51.480]  He goes on TV and says, I am the one that overthrew Ukraine and I will overthrow Putin.
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:53.680]  Russia is my empire.
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:57.440]  I played that clip like five times last week.
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:48:01.520]  So obviously they were trying to poke Putin into this, now he's done what they wanted
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:05.320]  or maybe it was all just hutzpah or bravada or hubris.
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:08.840]  But where do you see this going now, at least right of hand, gut level?
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:09.840]  Where do you see this?
[1:48:09.840 --> 1:48:12.920]  And he goes, you're right, Putin's fully committed, he's not going to back down, looks like the
[1:48:12.920 --> 1:48:16.600]  Ukrainians aren't going to back down, there's a bunch of U.S. and other state-behind networks
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:20.120]  there with high-tech weapons, a bunch of Russians and others are getting killed.
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:21.480]  This is a damn mess.
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:25.080]  Well, let me point out one other thing that Putin's doing and it's really important to
[1:48:25.080 --> 1:48:28.240]  understand what he's done and how significant it is.
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:33.320]  And Alex, believe it or not, you of all people will completely understand this.
[1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:37.000]  You've known the power in becoming self-sufficient.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.360]  That's why you have your own products, for instance.
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:46.640]  You saw, you had the vision a few years ago, to realize if you're dependent on other advertisers,
[1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:49.440]  they have a way to take you down, they have leverage against you.
[1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:51.520]  Putin's done the same thing.
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.440]  Russia has almost no debt whatsoever.
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:56.720]  They announced recently all of these sanctions.
[1:48:56.720 --> 1:49:01.520]  Let me just ask you, whether you think they're right or wrong, have the sanctions against
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:02.520]  Russia work?
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:08.240]  No, no, no, the sanctions only work on us with $6 a gallon gas.
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:09.240]  That's right.
[1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:14.840]  And what Putin's done is they announced yesterday that they're going to stop selling raw materials,
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:21.440]  which include things like energy resources, fertilizer, GMOs, and think about this.
[1:49:21.440 --> 1:49:29.200]  Think what a huge boon to them that people like Coke, Pepsi, McDonald's, and Pornhub
[1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:31.320]  are no longer in Russia.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:32.320]  Think about that.
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:33.320]  That's a good thing.
[1:49:33.320 --> 1:49:34.880]  It looks like getting a bunch of ticks off your ass.
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:36.760]  No, that's exactly right.
[1:49:36.760 --> 1:49:37.760]  And that's what I'm saying.
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:41.200]  Putin has been building a self-sustaining economy.
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.000]  Your student of history, you know at the beginning of the 19th century, the most powerful economy
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:52.200]  in the world was the China economy, the last empire, because they were self-sufficient.
[1:49:52.200 --> 1:49:56.000]  And the British had to come in with the Opium War to take that down.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:03.640]  But they knew the power of self-sufficiency as you've proven and as you tell your audience
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:04.640]  every day.
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.440]  You want to be, look, one of the reasons we like liberty is we like self-sufficient.
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:12.120]  And globalism is all about not being self-sufficient.
[1:50:12.120 --> 1:50:14.080]  And that's what I say.
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:16.760]  One of the best things.
[1:50:16.760 --> 1:50:22.160]  And I'm used to being on the radio, I'm on AM and FM, so I can't swear.
[1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:25.520]  But so I'll use a word that I know is safe.
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.360]  Russia said about the sanctions about three weeks ago, we poop on your sanctions, except
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:31.360]  they said the S-word.
[1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:32.360]  Just say it.
[1:50:32.360 --> 1:50:34.800]  Say, we shit on your sanctions.
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:35.800]  That's what they said.
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:37.600]  That was a quote from the Russian government.
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:41.000]  Literally, they said, we shit on your sanctions.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:42.240]  That was a quote.
[1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:45.140]  Now that told you what's happening.
[1:50:45.140 --> 1:50:50.160]  And so they're building a self-sustaining, self-sufficient economy.
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:51.360]  They're working with people.
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:53.240]  And you know what?
[1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:58.400]  When you're making a huge change like this, it's painful.
[1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:00.520]  Change is difficult, right?
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:03.200]  Anybody who's been, you know, I've gone through wars.
[1:51:03.200 --> 1:51:07.080]  Change is difficult, but it's often for the best.
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:11.160]  And you've got to get through the painful part to get to the good part.
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:13.280]  And I, I'm an optimist.
[1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:20.280]  I think Putin, by having Russia be a self-sufficient economy, and saying, we don't, okay, you
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:22.720]  want to sanction us?
[1:51:22.720 --> 1:51:23.720]  Just think.
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:25.240]  The sanctions are going to have no power.
[1:51:25.240 --> 1:51:26.240]  In fact, I don't know if you saw that.
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:27.760]  Well, they're going to have power to shut us down.
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:30.040]  Well, let me ask you this, then, and get back to your point.
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:32.880]  Well, we'll go ahead and make your point, but I've got an important question.
[1:51:32.880 --> 1:51:39.560]  No, I was just going to say in the headlines, the EU said, we can't sanction Russia anymore.
[1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:41.600]  We've reached the limits of what we can do.
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:48.600]  So the sanctions failed, their failure, and partially because Putin made a self-sufficient
[1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:50.280]  self-sustaining economy.
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:51.280]  Go ahead, Alex.
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:54.680]  Well, I was just going to ask you the question, then, what are they going to do when world
[1:51:54.680 --> 1:51:58.880]  leaders from Saudi Arabia, that you name it, won't even talk to Biden anymore?
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:51:59.880]  That's confirmed.
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:02.000]  The White House admits that.
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.360]  What does that signify?
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:11.680]  Have you ever seen that in your life where world leaders refuse to talk to a U.S. president?
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:13.280]  We've been watching the news for a long time.
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:16.920]  I can't think of that ever happening in the history of the country.
[1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:18.800]  Because that means they know he's not the president.
[1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:20.960]  He's literally an Alzheimer's patient.
[1:52:20.960 --> 1:52:22.680]  No, that's right.
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:29.360]  And Saudi Arabia has been, you know, Donald Trump, either the breaking headlines, he does
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:31.080]  have a little bit of an ego.
[1:52:31.080 --> 1:52:32.080]  You know that.
[1:52:32.080 --> 1:52:36.520]  But when Trump says this wouldn't have happened under Trump, he's right.
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:38.400]  This would not have happened under Trump.
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:43.960]  Because for one thing, Trump wouldn't have virtue signaled and not made a deal.
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:46.120]  The U.S. could have made a deal.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:47.120]  Just think.
[1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:53.920]  What would it have hurt the U.S. to say, okay, we'll have Ukraine stop attacking the people
[1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:54.920]  in the Donbass?
[1:52:54.920 --> 1:53:00.160]  We'll have them go along with the agreements, the Minsk agreements.
[1:53:00.160 --> 1:53:05.960]  It would have hurt nothing in the U.S. It would have cost us nothing to say, okay, we'll
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:06.960]  stop.
[1:53:06.960 --> 1:53:12.200]  See, the problem with NATO is we've been using Ukraine as a NATO proxy, putting missiles
[1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:13.200]  in there.
[1:53:13.200 --> 1:53:14.200]  Right?
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:19.160]  We've been, even though they're not a NATO country, we've been treating them like, you
[1:53:19.160 --> 1:53:20.160]  know, our bitch.
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:21.680]  I'll put it like that.
[1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:28.520]  And in Ukraine, I think the people in Ukraine are starting to realize that we're like somebody
[1:53:28.520 --> 1:53:33.560]  who pushes their friend into a fight at a bar and then turns around and hides, wants
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  to fight.
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:35.560]  Sure.
[1:53:35.560 --> 1:53:38.520]  Because even Zelenko now says he wants to be part of the EU, not NATO.
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:41.800]  How do you see this ending that Putin's not going to give up?
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:45.720]  Ukraine is saying, you need to surrender Russia, arrogant statements.
[1:53:45.720 --> 1:53:48.600]  Is that bravado or why are they saying that?
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:57.240]  No, it's complete bravado and they're in no position to set any terms.
[1:53:57.240 --> 1:53:59.640]  Russia has these cities surrounded.
[1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:05.240]  Mariupol is the home of the Azov battalion, the Nazis, the explicit, the guys you see
[1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:09.320]  with the Nazi uniforms and everything.
[1:54:09.320 --> 1:54:10.640]  That's what's in Mariupol.
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:18.720]  So I think where this ends is in about 10 days, Ukraine is forced within 10 days, 10
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:20.560]  days at most.
[1:54:20.560 --> 1:54:22.800]  Let's call it two weeks to be nice and even.
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:28.960]  Buy two weeks from today, buy the Thursday after next, Ukraine will surrender because
[1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:35.360]  Russia will have won militarily and they will realize that they have no support.
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:40.120]  What Zelenskiy's been trying to do is to get a no-fly zone, trying to get NATO to come
[1:54:40.120 --> 1:54:46.160]  in and even Poland is saying, Poland was saying, we're going to give you jets after
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.160]  Blinken gave them the green light.
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:53.280]  Think about this, Blinken said, we're giving the green lights for weapons.
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:57.960]  Then yesterday, they come out and said, no, no, no, never mind, don't do that.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:01.400]  They're afraid of Russia, that's what's going on, Alex.
[1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:10.160]  They're afraid of the mighty Russian military, which does have well-trained troops and fabulous
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:15.640]  weaponry and they haven't even used it, like the hypersonic weapons that Russia has.
[1:55:15.640 --> 1:55:16.960]  Forget nukes.
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:22.440]  The hypersonic missiles that they have are effective and they have them, they haven't
[1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:23.440]  used them yet.
[1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:27.600]  Meanwhile, we've got Harris, in fact, cue it up, just a short clip.
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:31.120]  Have you seen her cackling and laughing when they're asked about refugees?
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:37.240]  How would you send this moron who clearly couldn't manage a McDonald's to be the broker
[1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:38.240]  of this?
[1:55:38.240 --> 1:55:42.000]  I mean, what is wrong with the Western establishment?
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:47.280]  Well, you know, it's the problem at the end of empire, right?
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:50.920]  At the end of empire, you start to get Caligula in there.
[1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:53.440]  That's Hunter Biden for anyone keeping track at home.
[1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:59.120]  But you start to get bad leaders and do you know why?
[1:55:59.120 --> 1:56:01.120]  As he can't even believe she's there.
[1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:06.760]  She's literally acting like she's on ecstasy or something, just giggling and laughing while
[1:56:06.760 --> 1:56:07.760]  they're talking about refugees.
[1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.080]  I can't even believe in his videos.
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:12.240]  No, it's, it's horrible.
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:17.080]  And I'll tell you who's starting to wake up, Zelensky in Ukraine is starting to realize
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:21.760]  that he was pushed into a conflict with Russia that he didn't want.
[1:56:21.760 --> 1:56:27.240]  But you got to remember Zelensky was told by the Nazis in Ukraine.
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:30.040]  If you betray us, you'll hang in the public square.
[1:56:30.040 --> 1:56:34.640]  That's why part of the Ukraine giving up would be to keep those Azog battalions people
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:37.880]  in place because they're the bullies that will help them withdraw the next government.
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:38.880]  All right.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:44.080]  Well, hand in hand, great points as usual, amazing information, citizenjournalismschool.com.
[1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:46.080]  People can find your show there and all the work you're doing.
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:47.580]  Thank you.
[1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:48.580]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:56:48.580 --> 1:56:51.120]  Well, what he's saying is accurate.
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:52.240]  So there you go.
[1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.240]  It's a real mess, ladies and gentlemen, and they send Kamala Harris to the, you think
[1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:01.880]  that puts confidence in the Ukrainians?
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:09.760]  I mean, you'd send a general or you'd send a member of the Senate that's a, you send
[1:57:09.760 --> 1:57:10.760]  her.
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:15.680]  I mean, it's like they're trying to get the Russians to attack everybody.
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.600]  Like the horrible withdrawal out of Afghanistan, all of it is a damn joke.
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:23.320]  Infowarstore.com is how we stay on the air.
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:28.040]  We're going to sell out of our winter sun, vitamin D3, vitamin K product very soon, but
[1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:32.920]  I'm keeping it at 50% off, same thing with X3, the highest quality, deeper crystal iodine
[1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:36.080]  with two other types of better absorption, it's 50% off.
[1:57:36.080 --> 1:57:39.720]  And these products will be sold out at current sales rates in about five days.
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:43.520]  So thank you for your support, experience these products now and keep us on the air.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:45.120]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:57:45.120 --> 1:57:55.080]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022 and in the month of February we
[1:57:55.080 --> 1:58:01.120]  had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, the X3, that has all
[1:58:01.120 --> 1:58:07.320]  three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical, cellular
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:12.760]  activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:16.160]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:18.240]  This is the very best iodine output.
[1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:23.200]  So we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have or isn't going to
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:26.760]  come in for a long time, so I took it back to full process.
[1:58:26.760 --> 1:58:30.400]  I was just thinking, you know what, we need the funds in now to stay on air.
[1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:35.040]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs, so to incentivize folks out there that have
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:39.240]  been on the fence to get X3 and experience it yourself and support the broadcast, I'm
[1:58:39.240 --> 1:58:42.600]  going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[1:58:42.600 --> 1:58:47.800]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[1:58:47.800 --> 1:58:53.720]  And that has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth.
[1:58:53.720 --> 1:58:58.400]  And the next big casualty isn't even the people that die.
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:00.560]  No, that is very, very follows.
[1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:09.400]  But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and master censorship.
[1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:15.040]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[1:59:15.040 --> 1:59:23.720]  that if you amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[1:59:23.720 --> 1:59:26.400]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:31.880]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[1:59:31.880 --> 1:59:37.800]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:38.800]  and arrested.
[1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:43.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[1:59:43.080 --> 1:59:49.640]  the world against humanity that makes Infowars.com more important than ever.
[1:59:49.640 --> 2:00:00.960]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:00.960 --> 2:00:05.680]  Edward Dowd, the big Wall Street insider that first exposed the coming collapse of
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:09.880]  Moderna and Pfizer will join us coming up next segment.
[2:00:09.880 --> 2:00:13.440]  And we've got more on the Bioweapons Lab, exclusive information will be breaking down
[2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:14.840]  after he leaves us.
[2:00:14.840 --> 2:00:19.040]  But here is a very important report by John Bown at Band-Aw Video, the engineered energy
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:21.760]  crisis.
[2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:26.520]  Back at the gas station, you realize people want this solved, Anthony Okoko voted for
[2:00:26.520 --> 2:00:27.520]  the president.
[2:00:27.520 --> 2:00:28.520]  I'm a good Republican.
[2:00:28.520 --> 2:00:29.520]  Do what things are going.
[2:00:29.520 --> 2:00:30.520]  Something I've become.
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:35.840]  If you think phase one of the launch phase, COVID-19 was bad, the artificial cutting off
[2:00:35.840 --> 2:00:40.120]  of the world energy supply is a death sentence to hundreds of millions.
[2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:45.240]  And it is a poverty for another billion people or so, and that's in the numbers.
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:51.200]  At this pivotal moment, I see several priorities for the global agenda.
[2:00:51.200 --> 2:00:58.440]  We must revitalize the global economy and accelerate its transition to net zero.
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:02.680]  Last month we announced a $5 billion investment to build out a nationwide electric vehicle
[2:01:02.680 --> 2:01:03.880]  charging network.
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:10.040]  So the people from rural to suburban to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings
[2:01:10.040 --> 2:01:11.040]  of driving an EV.
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.600]  We're going to see gas prices likely increase.
[2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:18.520]  What is the thinking within your caucus about how to deal with that issue?
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:19.520]  That issue hasn't come up.
[2:01:19.520 --> 2:01:20.840]  That issue hasn't come up.
[2:01:20.840 --> 2:01:26.680]  We have to move to clean energy solutions with great accelerating.
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:30.160]  But a clean conscience is worth a buck or two.
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:34.040]  I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon.
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:38.280]  Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.
[2:01:38.280 --> 2:01:43.200]  We should be investing right here at home in renewable energy technologies.
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:45.920]  We should be weaning ourselves of fossil fuels.
[2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:53.160]  The spectacle of Biden publicly asking Saudi Arabia to increase output, publicly asking
[2:01:53.160 --> 2:01:59.240]  Venezuela to increase output, and then blocking all new oil leases on public land and most
[2:01:59.240 --> 2:02:04.160]  the other leases and shutting down several thousand pipeline spurs, including the Keystone
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:08.360]  Pipeline, a foreign army couldn't shut our power off like this.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:13.200]  It's simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy
[2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:14.200]  production.
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:16.440]  That's simply not true.
[2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:21.160]  One of the biggest changes that we've seen between the Trump administration and the Biden
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:26.040]  administration is the volume of regulations that are now on the table.
[2:02:26.040 --> 2:02:27.040]  President Trump was correct.
[2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.800]  He wanted to dramatically reduce the number of regulations on the books that that would
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:37.040]  actually provide greater autonomy and freedom for these companies and for the American people.
[2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:38.920]  Biden's doing the exact opposite.
[2:02:38.920 --> 2:02:40.560]  And it's even worse than that.
[2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:42.440]  He's looking to have mission creep.
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:46.840]  So if there's a traditional authority that the EPA operates, he wants the Federal Reserve
[2:02:46.840 --> 2:02:47.840]  to get involved.
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:51.360]  He wants HHS involved, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:54.040]  That's not how our Constitution system works.
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:02:58.940]  There are 9,000 approved drilling permits that are not being used.
[2:02:58.940 --> 2:03:04.080]  So the suggestion that we are not allowing companies to drill is inaccurate.
[2:03:04.080 --> 2:03:10.880]  The suggestion that that is what is hindering or preventing gas prices to come down is inaccurate.
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:13.120]  That accusation is a complete red herring.
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:17.800]  And it's really a distraction from the fact that this administration has paused leasing
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:22.000]  on federal lands, something that we're concerned about and something that we think needs to
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:23.880]  continue right away.
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:29.880]  The fact is that industry is producing at a higher level on existing leases on federal
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:32.520]  lands than in the last 20 years.
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:38.160]  And these leases take many years to explore, to develop, and to produce on.
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:39.480]  It's not truthful, right?
[2:03:39.480 --> 2:03:41.160]  And it's not truthful at all.
[2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:47.720]  From day one, day one, this administration has been hell-bent with their anti-American
[2:03:47.720 --> 2:03:52.600]  energy holy war to shut down the production of American energy.
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:54.160]  She knows that, right?
[2:03:54.160 --> 2:03:55.560]  It's delaying leases.
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:04:01.040]  Look, you can get a lease and then they delay the permits for you to be able to do seismic
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:02.400]  and do work on it.
[2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:07.600]  In Alaska, they delay the ability to get a permit for an ice road, which is how we go
[2:04:07.600 --> 2:04:10.040]  and do exploration on these leases.
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:11.400]  They've shut that down.
[2:04:11.400 --> 2:04:13.920]  They've tried to kill pipelines.
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:19.680]  Day one, you saw Biden said he wasn't going to produce on energy, on ANWAR, even though
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:23.200]  it's in the law that he has to do it, says Shell.
[2:04:23.200 --> 2:04:28.080]  And then you guys have people like John Kerry and Gina McCarthy going around to the American
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:32.000]  financial community saying, don't invest in American energy.
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:38.320]  So day one, they have been focused on killing the production of American energy.
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.680]  Phase one is to release the virus, lock down society, destroy supply chains, introduce
[2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:48.000]  the idea of a global digital ID as a vaccine passport, so they can then have a war and
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:53.680]  cyber attacks, and then bring down the world currency and blame COVID and the war for it,
[2:04:53.680 --> 2:04:59.560]  but offer everyone a universal basic income to survive.
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:04.360]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great infowars, listeners and
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:05.360]  viewers.
[2:05:05.360 --> 2:05:11.400]  If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system
[2:05:11.400 --> 2:05:15.960]  and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level, it will change your
[2:05:15.960 --> 2:05:16.960]  life.
[2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:17.960]  It will iterate you.
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:18.960]  It will empower you.
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:21.960]  Almost everyone has iodine deficiency.
[2:05:21.960 --> 2:05:22.960]  Look into it for yourself.
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:24.960]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:30.560]  It's the good, halogen, and then your purchase of X3 funds our operation.
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.760]  Now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because of the lockdowns
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:35.760]  and supply chain breakouts.
[2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:40.760]  We were sold out of X3 for a long time and I had it on sale for 50% off, a lot of folks
[2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:41.760]  were getting it.
[2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:45.240]  And I was thinking, you know what, I'm going to bring it back on sale again just until
[2:05:45.240 --> 2:05:46.240]  it sells out.
[2:05:46.240 --> 2:05:49.520]  Because even though we won't make as much money in the long run, a lot of folks need
[2:05:49.520 --> 2:05:53.640]  this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on air.
[2:05:53.640 --> 2:06:14.240]  See your X3 right now at 50% off and then FullWarsStore.com.
[2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:19.240]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on your mind.
[2:06:19.240 --> 2:06:25.400]  Well, three days before Putin invaded Ukraine, Kamala Harris was in Eastern Europe telling
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:27.240]  the Ukrainians we'd backed him in a war.
[2:06:27.240 --> 2:06:31.400]  But it's not just the Democrats, we've got Lindsey Graham and others running around saying
[2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:32.400]  the same thing.
[2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:34.240]  And now they didn't back down.
[2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:39.320]  They kept attacking Eastern Ukraine aboard the Russia and Russia attacked.
[2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:45.560]  And then here's Kamala Harris last night in Europe and they asked her about refugees
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:46.560]  and what to do.
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:54.120]  Well, she starts laughing like she's a hyena starring in the Disney movie, The Lion King.
[2:06:54.120 --> 2:06:55.120]  Here it is.
[2:06:55.120 --> 2:07:00.880]  For President Duda, I wanted to know if you think and if you asked the United States to
[2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:05.880]  specifically accept more refugees.
[2:07:05.880 --> 2:07:13.760]  Okay, a friend in need is a friend in need.
[2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:20.160]  Okay, so this time it keeps going.
[2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:24.800]  Madam, the situation is very complex.
[2:07:24.800 --> 2:07:31.360]  So when you are in over your head, this is what you see going on.
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:35.760]  I mean, listen, I've been studying this stuff since I was 10 years old and I could confidently
[2:07:35.760 --> 2:07:40.120]  do the job, but I would have real problems because there's so much you don't know.
[2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:42.240]  You're dealing with a lot of lives here.
[2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:49.760]  It's can you imagine knowing nothing and being in charge that Tucker Carlson has been a trailblazer
[2:07:49.760 --> 2:07:51.760]  on this.
[2:07:51.760 --> 2:07:56.800]  For weeks, he's been pointing out, what is she doing in charge of Ukraine?
[2:07:56.800 --> 2:08:00.600]  And it's not an anti-woman thing, I know a lot of women that have got their act together
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:01.600]  better than I do.
[2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:04.680]  A lot of ball busters, man, put them in charge.
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:07.880]  This is no Queen Elizabeth, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:07.880 --> 2:08:20.280]  This is an idiot, a true moron, got a big guess coming up.
[2:08:20.280 --> 2:08:25.280]  He's that big former Black Rock executive that called what was going to happen to Moderna
[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:27.680]  and Pfizer before it happened.
[2:08:27.680 --> 2:08:30.440]  He's joining us coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:32.440]  I mentioned this at the start of the show.
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:39.320]  I want to get it on record now and we'll go to our next guest, but again, I hate to give
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:42.160]  you the magician's trick, but you need to know it.
[2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:47.000]  You ever gone to magic shows, one of my favorite type of magic shows.
[2:08:47.000 --> 2:08:55.120]  I went to one last year in Round Rock that we're having and I went there with my wife
[2:08:55.120 --> 2:09:00.040]  and a couple of my children went and the magician would do the trick and then show everyone
[2:09:00.040 --> 2:09:01.040]  the trick.
[2:09:01.040 --> 2:09:06.440]  Now, that really makes a lot of other magicians mad, but that's the kind of magician I am.
[2:09:06.440 --> 2:09:11.200]  It's fun, you see the trick, it's neat, and now I'm going to show you how I deceived you.
[2:09:11.200 --> 2:09:16.200]  That's really what we do because it's okay to have a magician that fools people, but
[2:09:16.200 --> 2:09:20.160]  you can't do that in politics and religion and business.
[2:09:20.160 --> 2:09:24.520]  You can't be based on fraud, you can't be based on smoke and mirrors.
[2:09:24.520 --> 2:09:29.160]  My favorite type of magician is one that shows you the tricks and that's who I am.
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:39.160]  I show you their tricks, ladies and gentlemen, and that's why they hate my guys.
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:43.060]  People ask, how did you know, even before the war started three weeks ago, to write
[2:09:43.060 --> 2:09:47.800]  articles and talk about the bio weapon labs in Ukraine and what would happen in a war?
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:54.200]  The media first said, look, Jones and his website and his writers, they're talking about this,
[2:09:54.200 --> 2:09:56.840]  it doesn't exist, they're insane.
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:01.400]  But why was I already concerned about it?
[2:10:01.400 --> 2:10:07.480]  Because from past wars, they will always blame whoever they're attacking for chemicals,
[2:10:07.480 --> 2:10:11.480]  biologicals, or radiologicals that get released, and even if they're not released, they will
[2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:16.800]  then blame those people, and here it is.
[2:10:16.800 --> 2:10:27.320]  This, going back years, with links to the Washington Post, links to the Associated Press,
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:31.000]  and I love how the national polls, you're nice folks, but exclusive, deleted web page
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:35.840]  shows Obama led an effort to build a Ukraine-based bio weapon handling, especially dangerous
[2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:36.840]  pathogens.
[2:10:36.840 --> 2:10:41.920]  Okay, it's exclusive to the Washington Post, 2005, U.S. official Russian invasion of Ukraine
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:44.560]  risk releasing of dangerous pathogens.
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.480]  That was in February.
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:51.560]  So before everybody started pointing out what was happening, they were already warning
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:57.000]  about the U.S. lab saying, what do the Russians get them?
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:02.120]  And then Victoria Newland, the ambassador under Secretary of State, she comes out and she
[2:11:02.120 --> 2:11:05.640]  says it three days ago, and everybody's like, whoa, wait a minute, we're telling everybody
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:10.680]  it doesn't exist, but she says it does exist, and the Russians are going to get it and they're
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:14.560]  going to release it, so if any of it gets released, it's their fault, she's up front
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:17.920]  blaming them for the labs that Obama built.
[2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:23.320]  Say that again, she's blaming them for the labs Obama built that they previously did
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:26.360]  not exist in, but now they've gone, well, they've got the proof, the Russians have taken
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:32.520]  over the labs, so the Russians are going to release it, okay, all right, and of course,
[2:11:32.520 --> 2:11:37.820]  here's the U.S. today, fact check, false claims of U.S. bio labs in Ukraine tied to Russian
[2:11:37.820 --> 2:11:39.320]  disinformation campaign.
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:45.640]  I was back in February 27th.
[2:11:45.640 --> 2:11:49.400]  There's a lot of these other articles here that deal with this, but I've got some of
[2:11:49.400 --> 2:11:59.840]  the articles here going back 15 years, 16 years, showing all of this, so there they are claiming
[2:11:59.840 --> 2:12:05.840]  it's all disinformation, but let me actually show you the reports.
[2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:10.360]  Here's a meme out there with Alex Jones on it, false claims of U.S. Bioware for her labs
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:15.480]  in Ukraine grip QAnon, and they're going to say, Alex Jones is QAnon, all this other
[2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:21.080]  made up stuff, no, it's the U.S. government admitting this, foreign policy, the CFR puts
[2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:31.640]  out Russian biolab propaganda on Ukraine spreads on QAnon channels, U.S. dismisses claim of
[2:12:31.640 --> 2:12:37.080]  bioware for her labs in Ukraine yesterday, a day after the U.S. ambassador and the deputy
[2:12:37.080 --> 2:12:40.280]  secretary of state came out and admitted it was true.
[2:12:40.280 --> 2:12:41.520]  That's Reuters.
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:46.840]  Saki Gaslights claims Ukraine bio labs a conspiracy theory despite state department confirming
[2:12:46.840 --> 2:12:48.840]  their existence.
[2:12:48.840 --> 2:12:57.760]  She's the evil Chucky, and it goes on from there.
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:01.720]  Victoria Newland, Ukraine was biological research facilities, worried Russians may
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:10.160]  seize them, how could anyone look at Ukraine's refugees in the camps and laugh, well, that's
[2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:16.200]  who this lady is, and they don't care if a bioweapon gets released, because they'll
[2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:23.840]  just blame the Russians, and here's an article, U.S. funded biolabs Ukraine constructed, conducted
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:31.640]  research into back coronavirus, Russian M.O.D. says, they don't say it's in the Obama funding
[2:13:31.640 --> 2:13:41.520]  documents, it was on the news, and Glenn Greenwald has done a whole breakdown on this, Greenwald
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:47.360]  slays fact checkers as Newland's Ukraine biolab bombshell, and this whole article lays out
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:51.960]  the proof of what I just said, but here's one of the articles, Washington Post, August
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:58.920]  30th, 2005, listen to this and listen clearly, U.S. to aid Ukraine in conducting and countering
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:06.400]  bioweapons, U.S. to aid Ukraine in countering bioweapons, how do they counter them?
[2:14:06.400 --> 2:14:15.840]  By setting up stations, supplying highly lethal pathogens, and it goes on to say they were
[2:14:15.840 --> 2:14:24.240]  taking over the former Soviet bioweapons labs, and that they were expanding them, it says
[2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:32.280]  it right here, to counter the Russians, just like the Wuhan lab was to counter all of this.
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:37.280]  The United States and Ukraine agreed yesterday, this is 2005, the United States and Ukraine
[2:14:37.280 --> 2:14:42.040]  agreed yesterday to work jointly to prevent the spread of biological weapons, signing
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:47.200]  a pact that clears the way for Ukraine's government to receive U.S. aid to improve security at
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:52.400]  facilities where dangerous microbes are kept, and all the Russians said is these things
[2:14:52.400 --> 2:14:53.400]  are there.
[2:14:53.400 --> 2:14:54.400]  No, no, no, they're not there.
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:59.040]  The agreement, the result of more than a year of negotiations, was announced by Senator
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:05.480]  Richard G. Luger and Barack Obama during a visit to the Ukrainian capital.
[2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:10.920]  The senator's credit to Ukraine's revisionist, reformist leaders ushered into power last
[2:15:10.920 --> 2:15:16.280]  fall's Orange Revolution for breaking bureaucratic resistances of the pact.
[2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:20.800]  One lab to receive funding is the, and it goes over the whole name of it, the scientific
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:25.240]  research institute in the Black Sea Port of Odessa, the institute was part of a Cold War
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:30.840]  network of anti-plug stations, just like we call ours anti-plug, that supplied highly
[2:15:30.840 --> 2:15:38.000]  lethal pathogens to Soviet bioweapons programs, and then it goes into the U.S. expanding those
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:42.320]  labs under Obama, and then you're told they don't exist.
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:44.240]  Shut up, nothing to see here.
[2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:47.400]  Move along, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:16:16.920]  That is incredible, infowars.com for Mara's News today.
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:21.200]  Listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high-quality, storeable food in
[2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:27.760]  an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win,
[2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:32.000]  ain't no brainer, and they've got high-quality, storeable food ready to ship to you right
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:33.000]  now.
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:37.520]  The great folks at my patron supply exclusively prepare with alex.com discounted.
[2:16:37.520 --> 2:16:42.120]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the info war, the only way you lose is not
[2:16:42.120 --> 2:16:47.560]  taking action at infowars.com, or prepare with alex.com right now.
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:51.960]  This is high-quality, storeable food, this is how you beat inflation, get yours today,
[2:16:51.960 --> 2:16:56.000]  it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  is exploding.
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:32.520]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:39.400]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that
[2:17:39.400 --> 2:17:42.800]  only I own profitable.
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:49.600]  You will then be my slaves, oh, and then you'll get that special shot of vidum from
[2:17:49.600 --> 2:17:57.320]  me, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:02.640]  The first ten amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:07.560]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[2:18:07.560 --> 2:18:13.800]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:16.400]  and restraint by the government.
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:21.840]  Two hundred thirty-one years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:22.840]  attack.
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:25.480]  GCN is under attack.
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:30.120]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not want you to know the truth.
[2:18:30.120 --> 2:18:36.280]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and help us defend our right to
[2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:38.520]  continue telling you the truth.
[2:18:38.520 --> 2:18:39.960]  Would you like to join us?
[2:18:39.960 --> 2:18:48.120]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:52.640]  You may click follow, share, give and pray.
[2:18:52.640 --> 2:18:54.680]  You may select all of those choices.
[2:18:54.680 --> 2:18:57.160]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:04.600]  The globalist social insiders always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:07.200]  until the populations rebelled.
[2:19:07.200 --> 2:19:13.320]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:16.200]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[2:19:16.200 --> 2:19:21.760]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:27.440]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:31.720]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:35.040]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[2:19:35.040 --> 2:19:39.400]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:19:39.400 --> 2:19:45.800]  Like Canada, where they now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:48.480]  areas of the world are following suit, like Australia.
[2:19:48.480 --> 2:19:50.000]  So pray for these folks big time.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:55.400]  This is a very serious situation and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[2:19:55.400 --> 2:19:59.920]  paramount.
[2:19:59.920 --> 2:20:07.760]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:07.760 --> 2:20:22.600]  All right, I blew people away when last October I said the word is there should be a major
[2:20:22.600 --> 2:20:24.560]  war with Russia and China.
[2:20:24.560 --> 2:20:28.280]  China was green lit to go into Taiwan by late February.
[2:20:28.280 --> 2:20:32.400]  I had that from a lot of corporate and military sources that they've been told that people
[2:20:32.400 --> 2:20:36.280]  that have been right 90 plus percent of the time doesn't mean they're God doesn't mean
[2:20:36.280 --> 2:20:37.600]  things don't change.
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:42.120]  But I came on air and told you that that was really from high level media, high level corporate
[2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:46.000]  and high level military that I reached out to the military after I was told it.
[2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:51.320]  Well Edward Dowd basically has the same job but in Wall Street to forecast and to be able
[2:20:51.320 --> 2:20:55.600]  to be a futurist to see the trends and tie him together.
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:21:01.800]  He's worked at HSBC, Donaldson, Lufkin and many other places like Black Rock.
[2:21:01.800 --> 2:21:08.120]  He's worked all over Wall Street and the key is that he was able to predict what happened
[2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:13.480]  to Moderna and then Pfizer before it happened and the news that is now unfolding.
[2:21:13.480 --> 2:21:21.240]  So he joins us here with some amazing statistics and numbers dealing with CDC data broken down
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:22.640]  by age.
[2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:28.200]  The CDC doesn't do this but insurance experts did.
[2:21:28.200 --> 2:21:30.400]  The story tells us devastating.
[2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:35.560]  We're about to lay it down and again he can't comment on Black Rock due to all the stuff
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:36.560]  that's going on with that.
[2:21:36.560 --> 2:21:40.400]  He never has commented on Black Rock so we're not going to get into any of that with Edward
[2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:41.400]  Dowd.
[2:21:41.400 --> 2:21:43.720]  Edward thanks for joining us here today.
[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:46.120]  Quite a time to be alive in.
[2:21:46.120 --> 2:21:49.520]  Give us the 10 foot view and the 35,000 foot view please.
[2:21:49.520 --> 2:21:55.160]  Yeah, no problem, so last time I was on your show we talked about the insurance company
[2:21:55.160 --> 2:22:01.000]  results and that they were seeing excess deaths in the younger age group.
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:07.880]  Well, it turns out when you go into the CDC data and they don't break it out by age but
[2:22:07.880 --> 2:22:12.920]  my insurance industry expert who's been helping me, he's part of my team and he has actuarial
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:19.200]  training former Wall Street cell side analysts, he went into the data and we were looking
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:21.740]  for something else but a disturbing story emerge.
[2:22:21.740 --> 2:22:30.400]  He was able to break it down by age and create his own baseline death rates from the ages
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:35.480]  so all this excess mortality I'm about to show you comes from his work and he wants
[2:22:35.480 --> 2:22:38.960]  other people to recreate his work via the CDC database.
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:44.120]  It takes time and effort and some expertise but it can be done and we challenge other
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:46.760]  people to verify our results.
[2:22:46.760 --> 2:22:55.320]  Here's the punch line, the punch line is this, if you go to chart four, we call this the
[2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:58.320]  money shot, chart four.
[2:22:58.320 --> 2:23:07.780]  On chart four, basically you see that millennials experienced 84% excess death into the fall
[2:23:07.780 --> 2:23:10.120]  and winter of 2021.
[2:23:10.120 --> 2:23:18.520]  So excess deaths accelerated when mandates and boosters hit and this age group is important
[2:23:18.520 --> 2:23:24.600]  because they're healthy and you can't say that they miss their cancer screenings.
[2:23:24.600 --> 2:23:32.880]  This is ages 25 to 44 so this is just devastating evidence that the vaccines are causing this
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.360]  age group to die at an accelerating rate.
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:44.840]  The way I'd like to frame this is in the second half of 2021, I know I showed percentages
[2:23:44.840 --> 2:23:51.440]  in that chart but the actual bodies are 61,000 in the second half of 2021 millennial age
[2:23:51.440 --> 2:23:52.440]  group.
[2:23:52.440 --> 2:23:56.640]  To kind of wrap your mind around that, that's the Vietnam War event that just occurred to
[2:23:56.640 --> 2:24:03.040]  the millennial generation in the second half, 58,000 died in the Vietnam War from a U.S.
[2:24:03.040 --> 2:24:04.040]  standpoint.
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:09.520]  The same number died in Vietnam in 10 years, just died in one year.
[2:24:09.520 --> 2:24:10.520]  Correct.
[2:24:10.520 --> 2:24:18.040]  The Vietnam event for the millennial generation and I also want to point out, these are due
[2:24:18.040 --> 2:24:19.040]  to mandates.
[2:24:19.040 --> 2:24:23.320]  You can see the acceleration starting in the summer when mandates started hitting in August
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:28.720]  and September and then Biden came out and really clamped down the vices on that and
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:31.840]  boosters were also authorized and started happening.
[2:24:31.840 --> 2:24:34.360]  So let's call this what it is.
[2:24:34.360 --> 2:24:37.680]  Let's introduce a term I've heard you use before.
[2:24:37.680 --> 2:24:42.480]  This is death by government mandate or democide, death by government.
[2:24:42.480 --> 2:24:44.840]  That's what's going on here.
[2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:47.880]  And I don't even feel worthy to be covering this because we know insurance companies have
[2:24:47.880 --> 2:24:52.400]  said this, it's been confirmed, you hired a big statistician to dig into it.
[2:24:52.400 --> 2:24:53.400]  It's here.
[2:24:53.400 --> 2:24:57.520]  This is just breathtakingly painful to know these psychos actually did this.
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:00.240]  Why in the hell would they do something like this?
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:02.240]  It looks like it's premeditated.
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:06.280]  All these other scientists that had been in the same field said it was going to do this.
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:08.840]  They got warned, they bought off the regulators.
[2:25:08.840 --> 2:25:13.320]  Why would you commit such a giant crime?
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:16.760]  Well there's two ways to look at this.
[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:22.160]  Just good old fashioned power and greed or there was a plan hatched by some very evil
[2:25:22.160 --> 2:25:23.160]  people.
[2:25:23.160 --> 2:25:27.800]  I'm going with power and greed for now but as we roll through this very active fraud
[2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:32.200]  that's being exposed, there's more and more evidence coming to the front that this is
[2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:37.360]  part of some sort of bigger grand plan.
[2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:40.720]  What we've seen in the US has occurred in other, I haven't looked at their data but
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:46.080]  I'm guessing this has occurred in other global governments that have mandated the vaccines.
[2:25:46.080 --> 2:25:52.920]  So this is a worldwide tragedy and it's a war and whether the government knew it was
[2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:56.520]  a war on people, they're currently warring on their own people.
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:25:59.960]  And it's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life.
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:03.000]  Wow, well Edward you're doing groundbreaking work.
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:06.400]  Please continue with the news and information.
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:07.400]  Absolutely.
[2:26:07.400 --> 2:26:15.840]  So the other thing I want to point out, a couple weeks ago a German insurer, BKK, one
[2:26:15.840 --> 2:26:22.120]  of the board members came out and he said and used their data that the government was
[2:26:22.120 --> 2:26:28.440]  underreporting injuries, not deaths, forget deaths, was underreporting injuries by a factor
[2:26:28.440 --> 2:26:31.560]  of 10 to 1.
[2:26:31.560 --> 2:26:36.360]  Then they took their data and said well, if we just apply what we've seen in our own
[2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:42.120]  11 million clients and apply that to the total population in Germany, they came up with a
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:48.560]  number of two and a half to three million Germans who were injured by vaccines enough
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:52.040]  so that they had to go seek medical treatment.
[2:26:52.040 --> 2:26:56.960]  That's 3.6% of the German population or one in 25.
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:02.200]  So I would challenge any regulator at the FDA to tell me they've approved a drug with
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:05.040]  that kind of adverse event profile.
[2:27:05.040 --> 2:27:07.360]  I would say they haven't.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:12.320]  And so we have a fraud that occurred on the front end and now we're seeing the fruits
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:15.440]  of that fraud coming to fruition right now.
[2:27:15.440 --> 2:27:19.620]  Well, I agree that a lot of the evidence points towards a premeditated plan, but Moderna
[2:27:19.620 --> 2:27:24.960]  Panicking dumping most of their stock, deleting their Twitter accounts, that also shows that
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:30.000]  they did know that it was all just greed and insanity, kind of like what we saw with BP
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:34.640]  and the whole Deepwater Horizon ordering them to do drilling that the engineers told them
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:40.800]  would blow up and the CEOs and people just said screw you, drill without the concrete
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:41.800]  being poured in.
[2:27:41.800 --> 2:27:44.320]  So there's also kind of a corporate mental illness here.
[2:27:44.320 --> 2:27:45.320]  That may be it.
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:48.200]  I don't know what's scarier, but they don't even know they did this or they did it on
[2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:49.200]  purpose.
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:52.200]  No matter what, these people are crazy.
[2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.200]  Absolutely.
[2:27:53.200 --> 2:28:00.880]  Well, when the investigations ensue, we can figure out if there was a plan before this.
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:02.440]  I'm starting to get there.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:07.400]  I'm increasingly becoming more convinced that this was a plan rather than just power and
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:08.400]  greed.
[2:28:08.400 --> 2:28:12.560]  I need a little more evidence, but I'm leaning towards that at this point.
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:18.720]  I'm database, data-driven, so it's starting to look super ridiculously ugly from that
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:19.720]  standpoint, Alex.
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:20.720]  All right, brother.
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:21.720]  We're going to go to break.
[2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:22.720]  But how do people follow?
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:23.880]  We're going to come right back with you, sir.
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:27.120]  But how do people find all your groundbreaking work?
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:28.120]  Where's the best place to go?
[2:28:28.120 --> 2:28:29.120]  Twitter.
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:32.880]  Twitter just got off the seven-day suspension and I'm going to be mostly posting on Gettr.
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:40.800]  My Gettr is at Edward Dowd, D-O-W-D, and Twitter is at Dowd, Edward, D-O-W-D, Edward.
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:41.800]  Absolutely.
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:43.200]  Your work is the most important out there.
[2:28:43.200 --> 2:28:44.200]  Thank you so much for what you're doing.
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:47.520]  We're going to come right back to you, sir, on the other side.
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:48.520]  Wow.
[2:28:48.520 --> 2:28:52.040]  The numbers are insurance company breakdowns, folks, and government breakdowns from CDC
[2:28:52.040 --> 2:28:53.040]  numbers.
[2:28:53.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  Just a nightmare situation.
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:29:03.040]  Two of our best-selling products are back in stock, then FullWarStore.com, and they
[2:29:03.040 --> 2:29:06.800]  will sell out in the next three, four months before I get more of the product in if I sell
[2:29:06.800 --> 2:29:07.800]  it at full price.
[2:29:07.800 --> 2:29:12.640]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting
[2:29:12.640 --> 2:29:18.680]  X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are, and I believe you will then get
[2:29:18.680 --> 2:29:22.400]  hooked on them like myself, my family, and the crew are.
[2:29:22.400 --> 2:29:26.600]  So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun.
[2:29:26.600 --> 2:29:32.400]  They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I
[2:29:32.400 --> 2:29:35.280]  would estimate in less than a month.
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:39.480]  So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[2:29:39.480 --> 2:29:43.760]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune
[2:29:43.760 --> 2:29:44.760]  system as well.
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:49.800]  They're amazing, and they're at FullWarStore.com, and the reason this is a 360 win is it funds
[2:29:49.800 --> 2:29:50.800]  the operation.
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:52.800]  I need funds to run the operation.
[2:29:52.800 --> 2:29:53.800]  You need to be healthy.
[2:29:53.800 --> 2:29:54.800]  We need to stay on air.
[2:29:54.800 --> 2:29:57.800]  It's a match made in heaven.
[2:29:57.800 --> 2:30:02.080]  Experience the next level in high-powered energy neutropics with our latest brain force
[2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:04.200]  offering, Brain Force Ultra.
[2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:09.920]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form, with eight beneficial super-ingredients,
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:13.920]  Brain Force Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation.
[2:30:13.920 --> 2:30:19.640]  Three of toxic additives each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:25.120]  Some of the proprietary super-ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra include Garamacide,
[2:30:25.120 --> 2:30:29.800]  which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian
[2:30:29.800 --> 2:30:31.640]  tribes for centuries.
[2:30:31.640 --> 2:30:36.480]  Along with a GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:41.880]  Co-Leap and Ginko-Leap, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:46.000]  This product is more than twice the servings of our Brain Force Plus as well, so you know
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:48.320]  it's packed full of the good stuff.
[2:30:48.320 --> 2:30:53.640]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely
[2:30:53.640 --> 2:30:57.000]  sold out at infoorstore.com.
[2:30:57.000 --> 2:31:03.520]  Intent has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, then
[2:31:03.520 --> 2:31:10.320]  the next big casualty isn't even the people that die, no that invariably follows, but
[2:31:10.320 --> 2:31:18.600]  first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:24.240]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:32.920]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:38.280]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned, and of course now Canada is under this legislation
[2:31:38.280 --> 2:31:44.360]  that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[2:31:44.360 --> 2:31:48.440]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested.
[2:31:48.440 --> 2:31:52.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[2:31:52.280 --> 2:31:58.320]  the world against humanity, that makes infoorstore.com more important than ever.
[2:31:58.320 --> 2:32:02.880]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart, deep in my soul, I've ever had in
[2:32:02.880 --> 2:32:09.320]  my 47 years on this planet, I've had a lot of loss, like everybody else has, and it's
[2:32:09.320 --> 2:32:19.840]  because it's a loss of ancestral freedom that so many people fought and died and bled and
[2:32:19.840 --> 2:32:24.720]  sweared for, and now we're just throwing it all away.
[2:32:24.720 --> 2:32:30.200]  And I see the general public in a medically induced, scientifically induced, behavioral
[2:32:30.200 --> 2:32:37.000]  psychologically controlled trance, and I know we're being fed into this globalist being
[2:32:37.000 --> 2:32:43.760]  grounded, it's so incredibly sad, but this is the process of birth and then growth and
[2:32:43.760 --> 2:32:49.760]  then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing and then coming back to life again.
[2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:54.080]  It's just the globalists are actively trying to steer and control this process of decadence
[2:32:54.080 --> 2:33:00.080]  and collapse to actually end the species as we know it.
[2:33:00.080 --> 2:33:29.920]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.920 --> 2:33:37.920]  How are we supposed to get there with the way that we're living today?
[2:33:37.920 --> 2:33:51.920]  You talk lots about God, freedom comes from the call, but that's not what this bitch wants,
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:55.920]  not what I want at all.
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:34:13.120]  Edward Down is a Wall Street analyst, worked for all the major big companies, many of HSBC,
[2:34:13.120 --> 2:34:17.720]  you name it, BlackRock, and he's here as an independent citizen, going in and breaking
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:23.600]  down numbers that we've seen from insurance companies, but drilling into the actual numbers
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:26.680]  from the CDC and we see similar numbers out of Europe.
[2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:31.400]  They can cover up old people dying and claim it's something else, but they admit that we
[2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:34.840]  are having a shorter lifespan.
[2:34:34.840 --> 2:34:39.920]  They admit that way more people died last year than died the year before the vaccine,
[2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:48.360]  and so here we are continuing with Edward Down with this huge news facing this, going
[2:34:48.360 --> 2:34:49.360]  through the whole story.
[2:34:49.360 --> 2:34:52.040]  What other facets should listeners know about?
[2:34:52.040 --> 2:34:59.280]  Well, I just want to reemphasize that this is the CDC's own data.
[2:34:59.280 --> 2:35:04.640]  They don't make it easy for you to break this out, and they provide charts that aggregated
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:08.720]  into all age groups that doesn't tell the story I'm telling here today, and there's
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:12.520]  a reason they haven't broken out the data because it tells a devastating story.
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:19.600]  I suspect they know, in fact, they must know what's going on, and isn't it interesting
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:28.800]  that Michelle Walensky is refusing to answer Senator Ron Johnson's letters for information?
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:29.960]  These people are hiding now.
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:31.280]  We're in the hiding stage.
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:32.280]  We're spouchy.
[2:35:32.280 --> 2:35:34.840]  I don't see him anymore.
[2:35:34.840 --> 2:35:38.720]  This is getting to be ridiculous.
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:41.880]  Let me also go on to it.
[2:35:41.880 --> 2:35:46.040]  We've been dropping these charts one a day since starting Monday.
[2:35:46.040 --> 2:35:50.840]  We're dropping two more charts, one tomorrow, one Saturday, and I'll kind of give you an
[2:35:50.840 --> 2:35:56.200]  idea of what one of the other charts says.
[2:35:56.200 --> 2:36:04.680]  Since August of last year into February of this year, remember, we had miracle vaccines,
[2:36:04.680 --> 2:36:07.840]  and everything was supposed to be getting better.
[2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:13.000]  We shouldn't be seeing acceleration into the end of the year of death rates.
[2:36:13.000 --> 2:36:20.960]  The over 65 generation saw 306,000 excess deaths in the second half into February of
[2:36:20.960 --> 2:36:22.320]  this year.
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:25.680]  That is a World War II event.
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:32.360]  291,000 people died in World War II from the US.
[2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:37.200]  The baby boomer generation just had a World War II event.
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:40.480]  Let's take the numbers a little further.
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:44.040]  A little over 1.1 million people have that.
[2:36:44.040 --> 2:36:49.040]  We've had 1.1 million excess deaths since the pandemic began, many of which occurred
[2:36:49.040 --> 2:36:54.200]  in the second half of this year, which is, again, that's all we need to know.
[2:36:54.200 --> 2:37:02.600]  1.1 million excess deaths equates to 4,000 World Trade Center events.
[2:37:02.600 --> 2:37:08.240]  The media wants to talk about Ukraine, and we just literally had a war here on our own
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:09.240]  soil.
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:13.840]  We had a war with someone, and it's occurring.
[2:37:13.840 --> 2:37:14.840]  The numbers are there.
[2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:15.840]  They're not debating.
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:24.040]  It's even mainstream news that way more people died in 2021 than died in 2020.
[2:37:24.040 --> 2:37:26.360]  I don't know how they're going to be able to cover this up, and then you've got all
[2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:29.960]  the heart attacks, and the microcard diets, and the people getting sick that took the
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:30.960]  shots.
[2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:34.960]  I know a bunch of people because their jobs took the shots, and they are all, all of them
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:35.960]  sick.
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:41.000]  Military people, police, school teachers, professors, lawyers, they're all telling
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:45.440]  me, yeah, man, I got blood clots, I'm sick, what the hell happened.
[2:37:45.440 --> 2:37:50.800]  I mean, it's so crazy to ask her, I don't like going back to the motive, you're just
[2:37:50.800 --> 2:37:54.920]  going off the numbers, that we know what happened, but just the motive of this.
[2:37:54.920 --> 2:37:58.320]  Why would you do something like this?
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:06.480]  Well, this is speculation on my part, but since the creation of the Federal Reserve
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:11.560]  in 1913, the system writ large, not any one individual, but the system viewed a human
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:15.120]  being as a center of profit.
[2:38:15.120 --> 2:38:19.040]  We think about the debt bubble that I've talked about, the sovereign debt bubble, and all
[2:38:19.040 --> 2:38:28.680]  the liabilities associated, both unfunded and funded Medicare, pensions, what have you.
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:34.000]  What if the system writ large, viewed killing a human being is more profitable than extracting
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  profit?
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.160]  I'll just say that and leave it at that.
[2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:38.400]  What if that's what's going on?
[2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:39.400]  Well, that's it, exactly.
[2:38:39.400 --> 2:38:43.960]  With the social safety net people are invested in, it's easier just to kill them than to
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:45.920]  actually pay it out.
[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:51.920]  Yeah, and the math used to work, but maybe the math no longer works, and I'm not saying
[2:38:51.920 --> 2:38:56.240]  it's a bunch of people in a smoking room, but maybe there's just decisions being made
[2:38:56.240 --> 2:39:00.040]  one by one across the globe that we got a problem, we can't pay this money, and oh,
[2:39:00.040 --> 2:39:03.200]  here comes COVID, and oh, well, oh, well, some people are dying.
[2:39:03.200 --> 2:39:06.040]  I guess that's not great, but it's good for us long-term.
[2:39:06.040 --> 2:39:10.080]  And now we've got a new global social credit score and a new digital currency where we get
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:12.720]  rid of the old problem and have a new one.
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:13.720]  They admit that.
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:16.920]  And I've got it all right here, I know you tracked this, but it's the Davos Group, they're
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:18.120]  all announcing it.
[2:39:18.120 --> 2:39:21.560]  All the major central banks are announcing that soon they're going to control the money
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:27.640]  and program the money, and we'll actually dictate how you can spend the money.
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:28.640]  Exactly.
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:32.920]  And I don't think I said this on the show last time with you, but I said it in other
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:34.880]  interviews I've done.
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:39.000]  People asked, how did you come up with that series of tweets that predicted the future?
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:42.680]  Well, I thought we had a sovereign debt bubble, what would it look like if they used it as
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:43.680]  cover?
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:48.560]  You know, I have something that really got me to write that tweet series.
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:55.400]  And on April 5th of 2020, there was an interview on Face the Nation with Federal Reserve President
[2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:57.360]  James Bullard.
[2:39:57.360 --> 2:40:00.600]  And there was talk of, you know, the virus, this and that, and how are we going to come
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:01.600]  out of this?
[2:40:01.600 --> 2:40:03.400]  How's the economy going to reopen?
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:06.280]  People will be scared, we can't restart the economy.
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:13.520]  And he said on April 5th, 2020, that, well, it's great, we have technology.
[2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:18.880]  And we can come up with an immunity badge that people could wear.
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:23.400]  And then I didn't see the rest of the segment, but they said, we're going to roll it, when
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:26.680]  we come back, we're going to roll into the surveillance technology that would enable
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:28.120]  that to happen.
[2:40:28.120 --> 2:40:33.440]  So the Federal Reserve, a Federal Reserve bank president of St. Louis, floated that
[2:40:33.440 --> 2:40:35.640]  idea in April of 2020.
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:42.720]  Now a bunch of us on Twitter were outraged about that, and they floated that out there.
[2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:46.680]  If you notice, that disappeared from the national conversation in 2020.
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:50.480]  And if you said anything about vaccine passports, you would call the conspiracy theorists.
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:56.800]  Well, lo and behold, we had a lot of vaccine passports in 2021, didn't we, Alex?
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:40:57.800]  That's right.
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:01.000]  And you know, I started saying this two years ago, if they've launched something this big,
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:05.040]  they've got to have something that's so horrible later, you forget about the last attack.
[2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:06.520]  I think that's the war.
[2:41:06.520 --> 2:41:10.040]  I think it's the gas prices, the energy crisis, but I think it's something more.
[2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:12.800]  How do you think they're going to try to get out of what they've done?
[2:41:12.800 --> 2:41:14.080]  Because as you said, you're dead right.
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:15.960]  You said this, you were on a month ago.
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:16.960]  You said, oh, they're hiding.
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:17.960]  They're already hiding.
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:21.800]  And I was kind of, well, now they are, you're 100% right, they're hiding.
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:25.280]  But how do they try to extricate themselves out of this?
[2:41:25.280 --> 2:41:30.760]  Well, you know, there are no such things as coincidences.
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:39.560]  You know, the Ukraine war, which was set up, as you said, months ago, was launched on,
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:44.280]  I think, March 23 of 2022.
[2:41:44.280 --> 2:41:50.880]  And the timing on that couldn't be more beneficial to them, because that's when the German insurance
[2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:53.560]  company came out and said what they said.
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:58.280]  And then they, you know, a week later on the State of the Union address said COVID's over
[2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:02.080]  and everybody's lifting mandates and all this nonsense.
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:05.760]  They literally don't want to talk about this anymore.
[2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:11.840]  And you know, I think there's enough of us away who know how the games are run and how
[2:42:11.840 --> 2:42:16.360]  they try to distract with events.
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:18.960]  This event isn't going to hide what's happened.
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:22.560]  And there's plenty of people out there who are going to make sure we don't forget.
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:24.240]  The public doesn't forget.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:29.240]  We have alternative news media now, which I would say to you, I'm a futurist, right?
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:31.120]  You guys are already the mainstream media.
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:32.120]  These guys are dead.
[2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:33.560]  Twitter stock is in the tank.
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:35.600]  Facebook stock is in the tank.
[2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:37.480]  The mainstream media, they're dying.
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:42.600]  So if you were a public company, Alex, and you were a growth stock, I don't, I don't
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:47.800]  your stock hand over fist in my portfolio, because the future is bright.
[2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:49.960]  Well, that's what some other big players are saying.
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:50.960]  I hope it's true.
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:51.960]  We're going to try to win together.
[2:42:51.960 --> 2:42:52.960]  Edward Dowd, stay well.
[2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:54.720]  This will be right back.
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:43:04.840]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022, and in the month of February,
[2:43:04.840 --> 2:43:10.560]  we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product, the X3, that has
[2:43:10.560 --> 2:43:17.080]  all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular
[2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:22.520]  activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[2:43:22.520 --> 2:43:25.920]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:28.000]  This is the very best iodine on film.
[2:43:28.000 --> 2:43:32.880]  So we had on sale 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:37.240]  to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full products, and I was just thinking,
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:38.240]  you know what?
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:42.760]  We need the funds in now to stay on air, plus this is the right product everybody needs,
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:46.560]  so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:51.520]  it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells
[2:43:51.520 --> 2:43:52.520]  out.
[2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:57.600]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off.
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:44:02.640]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement that
[2:44:02.640 --> 2:44:04.960]  is now available at infowarstore.com.
[2:44:04.960 --> 2:44:10.400]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:15.000]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:16.560]  euphoric effects.
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:22.280]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:26.600]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:44:26.600 --> 2:44:31.280]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:44:31.280 --> 2:44:32.480]  loosen up a little.
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:37.400]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:43.400]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other
[2:44:43.400 --> 2:44:49.480]  herbs including, but not limited to, German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:50.480]  root.

[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:59.400]  go up because inflation is exploding.
[2:46:59.400 --> 2:47:17.200]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones.
[2:47:17.200 --> 2:47:35.840]  Let's just shut this down. And let's move on to war. Everdowd was there weeks before
[2:47:35.840 --> 2:47:41.160]  it began predicting it was about to unfold, Moderna, Pfizer, all of it. And now they're
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:46.560]  hiding you don't see them on any channels. They are so scared the awakening is massive
[2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:50.720]  but then you've got to be concerned. If these people are willing to pull this off and nothing
[2:47:50.720 --> 2:47:56.560]  to get away with it, they had a plan B to divert us. So how would they poke and prod?
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:01.480]  Who knows what they shipped into Ukraine to get Putin to invade? I'm not lionizing Putin.
[2:48:01.480 --> 2:48:07.480]  You're a smart guy. Edward, what is your view on this war and the economy and the gas and
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:13.160]  the fuel and national polls? 60 plus percent blame Biden, not the Russians. I mean, I've
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:19.400]  got Democratic Party articles right here that one of their big get-togethers dims and disarray
[2:48:19.400 --> 2:48:24.360]  at one of their conferences high level calling their retreat cursed. Yeah, I mean, but I
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:29.280]  don't even want them to be cursed. It's scary. They're in charge and you've got a bunch of
[2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:35.000]  insane. I mean, I mean, you've seen the Pelosi clips where she can't even hardly talk. This
[2:48:35.000 --> 2:48:40.240]  is frightening. It's the most pathetic thing I've ever seen
[2:48:40.240 --> 2:48:47.200]  in my life. And all my Democratic friends don't even talk about these people anymore.
[2:48:47.200 --> 2:48:51.720]  And they don't even, when those on the red team, I'm not on either team right now, I'm
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:55.760]  on team humanity, but when the red team starts giving them a hard time, they don't even want
[2:48:55.760 --> 2:48:59.240]  to talk about it. So that's where we are with those clowns.
[2:48:59.240 --> 2:49:06.080]  Let's go back to Biden's first day in office because I don't have a memory like Goldfish,
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:11.200]  like somebody in our country seem to have. He shut down the Keystone pipeline. That
[2:49:11.200 --> 2:49:18.160]  was his first executive order. Number one, I believe. Number one. So there was a plan
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:24.480]  to shut down this energy production in this country. And the high oil prices we saw before
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:33.240]  this war were due to that and also monetary inflation and also supply chain issues from
[2:49:33.240 --> 2:49:38.360]  these stupid mandates and obviously people dying around the globe and not enough people
[2:49:38.360 --> 2:49:45.880]  to fill the spots. So that's the one-two punch. What do I think is going to happen going forward?
[2:49:45.880 --> 2:49:50.960]  Well, I predicted on Steve Bannon's show this morning that we're going to go into recession
[2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:58.720]  in the third quarter. I had really smart friends on Wall Street predicting that in the fall.
[2:49:58.720 --> 2:50:03.120]  We have a really big problem with the Federal Reserve. I've seen studies that suggest that
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:07.560]  this rate hike cycle that they've been talking about raising interest rates, it's over before
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:12.920]  it began mathematically because the market dictates really what the Fed does. The Fed
[2:50:12.920 --> 2:50:17.400]  usually lags the markets and the market is suggesting that if they do raise one time,
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:20.800]  it'll be one and done and they're going to have to start stimulating again because we're
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:30.240]  rolling over. The other thing that's interesting is this rise in commodity prices, mostly oil,
[2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:35.240]  has occurred without its subsequent rise in short-term interest rates. It's the first
[2:50:35.240 --> 2:50:43.200]  one that's happened since 1983. So that suggests to me this is a supply shock more than anything,
[2:50:43.200 --> 2:50:47.800]  even though there's monetary inflation going on, it's more of a supply shock and I think
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:54.720]  done on purpose. All the actions of the Biden ministries have exacerbated this and caused
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:51:01.600]  this. So it lies squarely on their shoulders. So where are we? What's going to happen? So
[2:51:01.600 --> 2:51:06.640]  I think we're going to see a deflation. So the inflation in the last 10 years has been
[2:51:06.640 --> 2:51:12.960]  in financial assets. Yes, there's been some inflation recently in goods and services,
[2:51:12.960 --> 2:51:19.040]  but mostly the inflation went into financial assets from all the funny money they printed.
[2:51:19.040 --> 2:51:23.960]  What we're going to see is a deflation in financial assets and an inflation in things
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:30.560]  you need like food, Medicare, what have you, gas. By the way, I totally agree with that.
[2:51:30.560 --> 2:51:34.600]  That's bone chilling. You're going to see a deflation in the garbage derivatives and
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:42.080]  crap, but inflation in real things. This is going to be really rough. Alex, it's a one-two
[2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:49.120]  punch and I'm not a gloom and doomer. I just think that people out there need to get mentally
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:52.720]  prepared for a tough sledding ahead for the next couple of years.
[2:51:52.720 --> 2:51:57.040]  Well, that's what I was about to say. I'm not a futurist, economist, out guy like you,
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:02.320]  but we call it a recession, but people are starving to death all over the world. They're
[2:52:02.320 --> 2:52:07.720]  cutting off the supply chains. Now all of this cascading, 25% of the world grain being
[2:52:07.720 --> 2:52:14.800]  cut off. I think we'll be lucky if it's just a recession. In fact, beyond a depression,
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:18.360]  what do we call this? I don't even know what we're going into here.
[2:52:18.360 --> 2:52:24.120]  Well, it's interesting you mentioned grain. Wheat prices were already trending up and
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:29.880]  then once this war started, they went parabolic. We're already hearing, I'm hearing from a
[2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:38.000]  Wall Street guy and Dr. Malone who owns a farm that the wheat farmers and the hay planters
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:43.240]  are already saying they have to cut production because of fertilizer prices. I suspect, and
[2:52:43.240 --> 2:52:49.000]  I've said on other podcasts, we're going to see global food riots in the fall, maybe
[2:52:49.000 --> 2:52:53.200]  this summer going into the fall. It's going to be like the Arab Spring, but across the
[2:52:53.200 --> 2:53:01.480]  globe. You know the math on inflation, once food becomes 50% of your disposable income
[2:53:01.480 --> 2:53:05.880]  riots, usually food riots ensue. They always ensue.
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:13.720]  Yeah. We've already, as you know, last week crossed the threshold of the last Arab Spring.
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:21.480]  The level is now above that. Wow. Look, the spark is set. The fuse is
[2:53:21.480 --> 2:53:28.920]  lit, I should say. Look, my recommendation to Americans is don't freak out. Don't live
[2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:35.800]  in fear. Just tighten the belt. Learn how to fast. Fasting is good for the soul and
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:42.040]  good for your body. I do it all the time despite having some money still to buy things.
[2:53:42.040 --> 2:53:47.280]  Oh, I need to. You look great. I look like Jabba Thud. I mean, seriously, people should
[2:53:47.280 --> 2:53:51.480]  get ready to not, don't jump out windows. Don't panic. This is going to be the biggest
[2:53:51.480 --> 2:53:55.560]  time to wake people up and look at it as a way to wake people up in the hard times we're
[2:53:55.560 --> 2:53:59.360]  going into. I totally agree. Folks, don't commit suicide. Don't get depressed because
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:02.680]  your stupid bank account goes down. Just get ready now and you're going to be the leaders
[2:54:02.680 --> 2:54:09.880]  in the future. Yeah, exactly. Don't, if you have a lot of your identity in your bank account
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:14.800]  and your job and the stuff you have, you need to stop that right now because that'll lead
[2:54:14.800 --> 2:54:20.280]  to depression because it's going to, in my opinion, become less or worthless over time.
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:25.760]  Exactly. So what you need to do and what I've been doing and others have been doing is establishing
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:31.960]  human connection, relationships, a tribe, people you can rely on. And it's been wonderful.
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:38.840]  I've been meeting like-minded people and we're not scared. We're not living in fear. We're
[2:54:38.840 --> 2:54:45.080]  not excited about what's coming, but we're not going to lose our minds. Well, it's like
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:48.960]  somebody starts a fight with you. You're not glad some thug just mugged you and punched
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:52.120]  you in the head, but you're beating their ass. You're suddenly in the fight. It's like,
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  hey, I know how to do this. We didn't start the fight, but we're going to finish it.
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:00.640]  You know, Alex, it's funny you said that. You know, I'm not excited to be in this fight,
[2:55:00.640 --> 2:55:05.760]  but this is what I've been doing for free for the world for the last two months. This
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:10.880]  has been the best job I've ever had. I wake up every morning excited to get at it because
[2:55:10.880 --> 2:55:15.120]  I feel like I'm in the fight and it's a great feeling.
[2:55:15.120 --> 2:55:18.440]  Let me ask you this. We got a little segment, a little bit of the segment coming up and
[2:55:18.440 --> 2:55:23.120]  we need to join us again very soon. So you're dead over the target here, Edward. What else
[2:55:23.120 --> 2:55:27.240]  do you want to telegraph to everybody out there to be ready for?
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:36.200]  Okay. Let me drop a little news. The insurance Wall Street analyst that has been helping
[2:55:36.200 --> 2:55:43.280]  me is going to go public soon, but he's going to go public in his own way to an audience
[2:55:43.280 --> 2:55:48.440]  that can make a difference that has a financial interest in this fraud that is on the wrong
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:54.120]  side of this fraud. So look for that coming soon. What he's going to do will eventually
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:59.200]  go public. He's not going to put out a press release, but it'll go public. I also want
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:06.720]  people to understand that I was contacted by a very senior chief risk officer actuary
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:10.160]  at a major insurance company who wants to compare notes.
[2:56:10.160 --> 2:56:15.880]  So things are going on behind the scenes and this thing that I'm doing is I'm about to
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:19.440]  lose control of it and I'm gladly going to hand it off to my friend who's been doing
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:26.000]  all the work. And if you're on Wall Street and you still think Pfizer, Moderna are good
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:30.560]  buys, I got news for you. There's some catalysts coming that are probably not going to be good
[2:56:30.560 --> 2:56:32.200]  for holding those stocks.
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:39.440]  Well, let's come back and talk about this, but let's start now. Melinda French Gates
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:44.080]  coming out saying it's Bill's problem. He's got an answer for Epstein. Epstein's the most
[2:56:44.080 --> 2:56:49.240]  evil man on earth. I mean, she is burning Bill. That shows her. She knows big stuff's
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:50.240]  coming out.
[2:56:50.240 --> 2:56:57.280]  Oh, absolutely. Alex, you and I, I told you on your last show, you're a stock picker.
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:01.000]  You just didn't know it. These are what we call tells. These are things that happened
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:07.520]  before the news comes. And one of the tells on Pfizer was the CFO of Pfizer, Lou Demalio,
[2:57:07.520 --> 2:57:13.400]  who helped run Lucid into the ground in that dot com bubble. He left in November because
[2:57:13.400 --> 2:57:17.240]  he knows what's coming. He doesn't want to be there. He retired. He said, you know, I've
[2:57:17.240 --> 2:57:21.600]  seen this movie before. It doesn't end well. You know, I don't think he was involved in
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:26.240]  the fraud, but he was the numbers guy. There's no accounting fraud advisor, but you probably
[2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:31.560]  heard what was going on and he was horrified and he, he exited stage left. So Melinda Gates
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:34.920]  is a tell something bad's coming.
[2:57:34.920 --> 2:57:38.640]  Damn right. We'll come back to five more minutes with Edward Dowd. You can also find all his
[2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:47.920]  great work at d o w d e ward. And that's on Twitter. So be sure and check that out. It's
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:54.400]  hard to believe that we're already into March 2022. And in the month of February, we had
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:58:00.520]  a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X three. That's all three
[2:58:00.520 --> 2:58:07.120]  types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity
[2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:12.600]  in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much. And the majority of
[2:58:12.600 --> 2:58:18.200]  the population of the world is iodine deficient. This is the very best iodine output. So we
[2:58:18.200 --> 2:58:22.520]  had on self 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have, or is it going to come
[2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:27.520]  in for a long time? So I took it back to full process. I was thinking, you know what, we
[2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:32.200]  need to funds in now to stay on air. Plus, this is a great product. Everybody needs.
[2:58:32.200 --> 2:58:36.120]  So incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X three and experience
[2:58:36.120 --> 2:58:41.760]  yourself and support the broadcast. I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out get
[2:58:41.760 --> 2:58:49.920]  X three right now exclusively at info or store.com for 50% off. So I did it. I signed up for the
[2:58:49.920 --> 2:58:54.920]  Austin marathon. I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness
[2:58:54.920 --> 2:59:00.720]  for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store.com. Before I set out on a run, I throw
[2:59:00.720 --> 2:59:05.560]  down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going, you know, besides the
[2:59:05.560 --> 2:59:11.520]  energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and
[2:59:11.520 --> 2:59:16.500]  the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance
[2:59:16.500 --> 2:59:21.920]  at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore less.
[2:59:21.920 --> 2:59:26.960]  I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they
[2:59:26.960 --> 2:59:32.560]  need right now plus inflammation support and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules
[2:59:32.560 --> 2:59:37.400]  help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough
[2:59:37.400 --> 2:59:42.080]  to take out a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity
[2:59:42.080 --> 2:59:49.080]  you need for every day and sore less can keep you moving and feeling great at any age leading
[2:59:49.080 --> 3:00:03.680]  a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones. Vietnam level event,
[3:00:03.680 --> 3:00:10.640]  58,000 dead young Americans, a World War two level event in our older people. I don't
[3:00:10.640 --> 3:00:15.440]  just believe Edward doubt. I've saw the numbers, but he's gone out with experts and crunched
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:22.240]  him. It's not deniable, ladies and gentlemen, this happened and the psychos, the crazy people
[3:00:22.240 --> 3:00:26.600]  that did this are still in control, though they're hiding, which is a good sign at some
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:30.840]  levels, a bad sign at others. And we're trying to join us again, not just once a month, but
[3:00:30.840 --> 3:00:35.440]  next Kansas is a quickening happening. I watch you when you're on the war room and the, you
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:39.400]  know, Steve Bannon, those great guys doing a really good job breaking all this down.
[3:00:39.400 --> 3:00:43.320]  But in closing in the five minutes, we've got left other things you want to get out
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:48.240]  to people and also what, what is the solution? What else do you think people can do to try
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:54.720]  to put the fear of God in these globalists to stop? Or do we just market wise crash their
[3:00:54.720 --> 3:00:57.200]  companies and then they stop? I mean, what do we do?
[3:00:57.200 --> 3:01:02.040]  Well, it's, it's a multi vector attack. We've got the doc, the good doctors who came out
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:06.480]  early with the, with the evidence. We've got lawyers now involved and then I'm trying to
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:11.680]  help on the Wall Street side, but you know, we need everybody and this is, this has always
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:16.800]  been a battle for the marginal mind. And the more we can wait and convince that they were
[3:01:16.800 --> 3:01:23.240]  literally just poisoned, the more of a chance we have for these guys to literally go down
[3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:28.960]  without a fight because they need, they need their useful idiots to believe their lies.
[3:01:28.960 --> 3:01:33.240]  And we, if we get it, you know, the American revolutions really only started with 5% of
[3:01:33.240 --> 3:01:41.440]  the population that were active. We can get to 10, 15, 20, 30%. It's over. We win.
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:46.280]  You know, I'd also like to make, you know, a plea to the members of the cult in the mainstream
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:49.440]  media because it came out recently that they were getting paid off by the government to
[3:01:49.440 --> 3:01:56.040]  spread these lies. That's, that's not a fact. My plea to some of these cult members, and
[3:01:56.040 --> 3:01:59.600]  it's a cult because there's retribution if you step out of line, we see that with anybody
[3:01:59.600 --> 3:02:06.480]  that ever steps out of line. My plea is this, you just got poisoned. The people that you
[3:02:06.480 --> 3:02:13.200]  supposedly work for poisoned you through mandates or whatever. It's time for you to figure out
[3:02:13.200 --> 3:02:18.440]  where you stand on this side of the fight and do your part within these institutions
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:23.640]  to get the word out to the rest of the people. That's my final message.
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:30.320]  Absolutely. I mean, it's like Nazis in World War II or the Soviets. Going along with this
[3:02:30.320 --> 3:02:34.400]  is you're denying your humanity. You're in a cult. You're not allowed to be free or
[3:02:34.400 --> 3:02:39.720]  persecuted if you tell the truth. And we need people in the MSM to not just get caught on
[3:02:39.720 --> 3:02:44.640]  tape with Project Veritas. We need them to break through and say it was wrong and come
[3:02:44.640 --> 3:02:46.640]  out against it.
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:51.600]  Absolutely. We don't need the project. I mean, Project Veritas does Yeoman's work. I'm not
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:57.680]  going to take anything away from them. We need someone to get on TV and say, oh my God,
[3:02:57.680 --> 3:02:58.680]  what just happened?
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:02:59.680]  We need confessions.
[3:02:59.680 --> 3:03:06.800]  We need confessions. And that's what's going to save these people. No one's going to hate
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:11.600]  people to confess. We're going to love them. Don't they get it's all going to burn down?
[3:03:11.600 --> 3:03:15.880]  It already is. The only way to go is to repent.
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:22.880]  I absolutely agree. Redemption. Anybody can be redeemed. I mean, yeah, my journey to this
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:28.160]  point in time, I wasn't always doing the right thing. But over the over time, I've learned
[3:03:28.160 --> 3:03:34.440]  that doing the right thing is rewarding from a mental health standpoint. So people need
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:38.000]  to understand that doing the right thing, no one's ever going to be mad at you for doing
[3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:43.360]  the right thing. And we have forgiveness in our hearts for anybody that was wrong and
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:49.800]  said awful things. If you pull 180 and you mean it and you have impact, you will be forgiven.
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:03:53.680]  You may not avoid consequences, but you will be forgiven.
[3:03:53.680 --> 3:03:58.840]  That's what matters. I mean, look at Bill Gates's ex-wife. I mean, people like screw
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:04:03.200]  her. She's a devil. Hey, we don't know that and we can't attack her. That'll keep others
[3:04:03.200 --> 3:04:06.400]  from turning against the system. We want to welcome these people.
[3:04:06.400 --> 3:04:11.080]  Correct. All right, powerful interview. Edward Dowd,
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:16.040]  thank you so much. People can find you all over the place. But on Getter, you're saying

[3:04:27.400 --> 3:04:32.120]  for us through all these legal battles. Really appreciate you and Owen and all the rest of
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:35.800]  your crew. So thank you. We appreciate you. Wow. All right, folks,
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:40.800]  I'm going to come back and introduce our next guest who's running for Congress against,
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:46.920]  uh, running against Gilhahn Omar. So that's coming up on the other side. Wow. What a crazy
[3:04:46.920 --> 3:04:57.280]  time to be aligned. And the documents are clear, folks. It's now up to us to take action.
[3:04:57.280 --> 3:05:02.800]  It's time to protect your privacy. It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though
[3:05:02.800 --> 3:05:08.200]  you don't have anything to hide, criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[3:05:08.200 --> 3:05:13.360]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what
[3:05:13.360 --> 3:05:19.360]  you do. So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down, protecting
[3:05:19.360 --> 3:05:23.280]  your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts, protecting
[3:05:23.280 --> 3:05:27.880]  your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount. That's why everybody

[3:06:02.840 --> 3:06:13.880]  The answer to 1984 tyranny is 1776. We're about to hand up a ton to our next special
[3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:19.360]  guest Royce White. And yeah, I like he was a former NBA player in a current MMA fighter,
[3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:24.720]  but I like him because he's smart and knows what's going on. He's about to host the rest
[3:06:24.720 --> 3:06:29.000]  of this hour. But man, that Edward Dowd interview with the documents and I've had insurance
[3:06:29.000 --> 3:06:33.960]  companies look at it and I've had statisticians too. And I mean, it's in the insurance numbers
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:40.440]  that they are killing millions of people just in the US alone. I mean, that's a fact. It's
[3:06:40.440 --> 3:06:45.840]  hard to like cover this and move on to something else. But I mean, this is the globalist. They
[3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:52.040]  have a fetish to kill people. They just they're sick. Please keep us on air. You got to realize
[3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:57.440]  millions of people, let's be conservative, 2 million people on radio stations, TV stations
[3:06:57.440 --> 3:07:01.360]  and the Internet, conservatively or tuned in today. And a couple million more in the
[3:07:01.360 --> 3:07:05.400]  next 24 hours, we'll see the band podcast and watch us a band off video. That's four
[3:07:05.400 --> 3:07:11.480]  million people. That's an army. US military is not four million people. The Russian military
[3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:15.160]  is not a million people. The Chinese military is about 10 million people. The point is we're
[3:07:15.160 --> 3:07:19.640]  not going to go blows to overkill people. We've just got to tell people about the truth
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:23.840]  and then tell them to tell them about the truth. And then we're going to win. And people
[3:07:23.840 --> 3:07:27.520]  are ready for the truth right now. You want to know why your gas prices are six bucks
[3:07:27.520 --> 3:07:37.200]  in California and 420 in Texas and $5 in Minnesota and $5 in New York and $5 in Florida? Here's
[3:07:37.200 --> 3:07:41.320]  your being screwed. So I want to thank the listeners for their support. I want to encourage
[3:07:41.320 --> 3:07:45.200]  everybody to keep us on air because we're literally right on the edge of being in the
[3:07:45.200 --> 3:07:50.240]  red of the black right now, which is fine. But do you want Alex Jones, your truly pumpkin
[3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:57.520]  head, spending five hours a day trying to raise the money? No. So I need to stay on
[3:07:57.520 --> 3:08:06.120]  air and I got products you need. X3, still 50% off. Winter sun, still 50% off. Brain
[3:08:06.120 --> 3:08:12.080]  force ultra, 40% off. And all this stuff is selling out very, very soon. But I'm selling
[3:08:12.080 --> 3:08:17.640]  it to get it out there and you need it. And it keeps us on air with, I mean, I love signing
[3:08:17.640 --> 3:08:22.160]  that check every month for $200,000 in bandwidth, knowing that hundreds of millions of people
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.160]  tuned in, but it's still hard to do it. See, everybody else goes to Twitter or Facebook
[3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:32.120]  or YouTube and just it's all paid for by big tech. So they control it. We are paying for
[3:08:32.120 --> 3:08:37.760]  the bandwidth. And I'm not bitching, but our success is what's killing me. So please support
[3:08:37.760 --> 3:08:43.080]  us financially and help get the word out to folks that aren't awake yet, infowarstore.com
[3:08:43.080 --> 3:08:51.840]  or AAA-253-3139. All right, ladies and gentlemen, our next great guest takes over Roy Swight
[3:08:51.840 --> 3:08:58.680]  right now running for Congress against Ilhan Omar. He's got a lot to say. Thank you, Roy
[3:08:58.680 --> 3:09:00.680]  Swight. Take it away.
[3:09:00.680 --> 3:09:06.160]  Thanks, man. I appreciate it, Alex. I'm always happy to be here. Yeah, I think, you know,
[3:09:06.160 --> 3:09:15.480]  for me, the most troubling thing of our time is this globalist movement, this idea of globalism
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:22.520]  and just how hard it is to get people to understand how serious they are about their plans for
[3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:27.240]  the future and their plans for people. You know, I'm running for Congress right now and
[3:09:27.240 --> 3:09:33.800]  it's one of the calling cards of my campaign is to talk about globalism, to talk about
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:37.320]  this idea of the great reset where you're going to own nothing and be happy. And I have
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:41.640]  to stress to people that, you know, when they say you're going to own nothing and be happy,
[3:09:41.640 --> 3:09:45.520]  they're not saying we're going to make your life more fulfilling and meaningful. They're
[3:09:45.520 --> 3:09:50.560]  saying we're going to make the material high so good, you're not going to notice that we're
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.360]  stealing from you. And when your government steals, when your government makes it lawful
[3:09:55.360 --> 3:10:02.560]  to steal, everybody's stealing. That's the reality. Everybody's stealing. And, you know,
[3:10:02.560 --> 3:10:08.960]  Congress, for example, is supposed to be regulating the Fed. They're supposed to be the ones in
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:12.960]  control of the Fed. They're supposed to be giving the marching orders to the Fed. But
[3:10:12.960 --> 3:10:18.400]  instead, we got Wall Street, you know, over top of the Fed and big corporations, big global
[3:10:18.400 --> 3:10:26.120]  transnational corporations controlling the Fed. And really, we got those same organizations
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:31.320]  controlling our Congress, controlling individual politicians. But ultimately, the Fed ends
[3:10:31.320 --> 3:10:35.880]  up controlling the Congress. The Fed ends up controlling the Congress. And this thing
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:47.320]  is all the way backwards. You know, to me, I have trouble with watching my fellow American
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:55.000]  citizens be fooled and sort of hypnotized at this level. And like I said, they're going
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:00.120]  to try and make the material high so good that you just won't notice. You'll be distracted.
[3:11:00.120 --> 3:11:08.560]  You won't be able to manifest a real resistance against these evil forces. And they are evil.
[3:11:08.560 --> 3:11:17.200]  And this is part of the reason why I've continued to stress my faith in God. And I think this
[3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:26.800]  country isn't a crisis, in a very dire crisis. And the only way for us to save this country
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:32.560]  is by restoring our faith in God and our national honor. And we have to give people security
[3:11:32.560 --> 3:11:37.520]  and opportunity. And I'm all for that. I'm all for government doing what they can to
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:43.440]  create security and opportunity. But we have to do it through American constitutional values.
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:52.400]  We have to do it through truth. We have to do it through freedom. Freedom is the cornerstone.
[3:11:52.400 --> 3:12:01.520]  That's become a sort of lost value for us. Freedom, number one, but the truth. And the
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:08.120]  truth is that the global affects the local. The global affects the local. And these Democrats,
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:13.520]  these liberals, but really the uniparty, the uniparty has lied to us. They've misled
[3:12:13.520 --> 3:12:21.880]  us. They've misrepresented us. They've sold us on this fantasy of globalism. And ultimately,
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:27.560]  all they want to do is create the next iteration of slavery. They want to go to slavery 2.0.
[3:12:27.560 --> 3:12:35.760]  They want you to be so hooked on all of the material goods that you never stop to notice
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:41.880]  that they're taking away everything that's meaningful about your life. They're creating
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:49.920]  drones. And what's worse about it is the droning of the American people or the droning of society
[3:12:49.920 --> 3:12:54.720]  is just a stop gap until they can get rid of us and just use robots. And they're not
[3:12:54.720 --> 3:13:01.480]  really shy about that. And I'm running for Congress here as a Republican in the Minnesota
[3:13:01.480 --> 3:13:06.200]  Smith Congressional District. And I see some of these same issues on both sides of the
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:17.160]  aisle. I think there's a huge, huge problem in my own party with having a real declarative
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:22.680]  belief in God. And I'm not saying that everybody needs to be Christian or Catholic. I'm not
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:27.560]  saying everybody needs to believe in one God, although I do. But what I will say is we were
[3:13:27.560 --> 3:13:33.240]  completely mistaken. We were completely mistaken and arrogant and naive to think that we could
[3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:38.800]  take God from society and still maintain a moral and ethical structure, a sound moral
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:48.120]  and ethical base to our communities and our individual relationships and certainly in
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:52.920]  the relationship between government and the free people. And make no mistake about it.
[3:13:52.920 --> 3:13:58.400]  I mean, we are under the thumb of a corporatocracy. I said it before and I'll say it again. The
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:04.440]  five headed hydro of the New World Order is very clear. You got the three industrial complexes,
[3:14:04.440 --> 3:14:11.560]  media, medicine, military, you got big tech, and you got the central banks. And the New
[3:14:11.560 --> 3:14:17.640]  World Order scam is very, very clear. We're going to scam you and you're going to be too
[3:14:17.640 --> 3:14:24.440]  distracted and too high to see it. And this is troubling. This is probably the most troubling
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:30.760]  thing for me. And I think people like Alex, you know, people like Bannon and other individuals
[3:14:30.760 --> 3:14:37.800]  who the mainstream media has such a stronghold on our cultural narrative that they're able
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:44.240]  to pincer these individuals or individuals like us with character attacks that are accepted
[3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:51.320]  by the masses. And I grew up in a community that was cultural, full of cultural Democrats,
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:58.040]  people who believe that they should vote Democrat solely on the basis that the Democratic Party
[3:14:58.040 --> 3:15:03.840]  is more amenable to civil rights and on the falsity that the Republican Party are just
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:11.920]  racist. It's very hard, even for me today, to be running as a Republican and knowing
[3:15:11.920 --> 3:15:17.400]  that many of the people in my own family even, you know, look at my allegiance to a person
[3:15:17.400 --> 3:15:22.400]  like a Steve Bannon or the America First Movement or a truth teller like Alex Jones
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:28.000]  and see that as a betrayal. And it's very hard to get them to understand and commit
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:33.760]  and invest the time to look into these issues enough to be able to find that clarity and
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:41.440]  truth that many of us have already found. I think that one of the biggest hurdles for
[3:15:41.440 --> 3:15:48.120]  us going forward is to really find the faith in God, to be able to take a ministry of truth
[3:15:48.120 --> 3:15:55.480]  into the belly of the beast, because this country, we will lose slowly, but surely.
[3:16:18.120 --> 3:16:47.640]  We will lose slowly, but surely, we will lose slowly, but surely, we will lose slowly,
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:17:09.600]  but surely, we will lose slowly, but surely, we will lose slowly, but surely, we will lose
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:36.240]  slowly, but surely, we will lose slowly, but surely, we will lose slowly, but surely, we
[3:17:36.240 --> 3:17:41.160]  inflation, be prepared, fund the InfoWare. The only way you lose is not taking action
[3:17:41.160 --> 3:17:46.880]  at InfoWareStore.com or prepare with alex.com right now. This is high quality storeable
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.480]  food, this is how you beat inflation, get yours today, it's ready to ship, but I wouldn't
[3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:55.320]  wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:17:59.160]  Mike in California, thanks for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling
[3:17:59.160 --> 3:18:05.240]  this gain-of-function research. Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government
[3:18:05.240 --> 3:18:11.100]  gain-of-function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain-of-function
[3:18:11.100 --> 3:18:16.320]  research involving influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses. There's nothing about SARS-like viruses
[3:18:16.320 --> 3:18:20.720]  and if the research funding pause, it's not a stop, it's not a prohibition, it's when
[3:18:20.720 --> 3:18:24.640]  you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look both ways
[3:18:24.640 --> 3:18:29.480]  and then you proceed and so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain-of-function, just selected
[3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:34.200]  gain-of-function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification
[3:18:34.200 --> 3:18:38.600]  research, so Rand and others, maybe Fauci was right, they don't quite know what they're
[3:18:38.600 --> 3:18:42.400]  talking about calling it gain-of-function, that's why he didn't perjure himself, that's
[3:18:42.400 --> 3:18:46.360]  why he hasn't been arrested. Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms
[3:18:46.360 --> 3:18:50.720]  that mimic what the viruses do, but in the main definition, it's still a gain-of-function,
[3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:54.520]  they're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike,
[3:18:54.520 --> 3:19:00.520]  we love you. The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones
[3:19:00.520 --> 3:19:04.920]  to leading a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you're getting
[3:19:04.920 --> 3:19:09.960]  enough in your system with a supplement that contains both. This InfoWars life offering
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:15.080]  vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[3:19:15.080 --> 3:19:19.920]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:25.680]  contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for
[3:19:25.680 --> 3:19:30.240]  a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with
[3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:35.560]  pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably
[3:19:35.560 --> 3:19:40.320]  already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance
[3:19:40.320 --> 3:19:45.600]  of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:50.200]  in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[3:20:20.200 --> 3:20:25.320]  You know, I laid out in the last segment my thoughts about globalism and just how dangerous
[3:20:25.320 --> 3:20:32.320]  it's become. And I think what we're seeing right now going on in the world, obviously
[3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:39.600]  with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we're seeing a information attack on common
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:47.760]  people all over the world who don't have a very good understanding of history, right?
[3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:54.880]  Understanding of the First World War, the Second World War, you know, the Warsaw Pact,
[3:20:54.880 --> 3:21:00.320]  the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War. All of these things have a time horizon beyond
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:06.520]  the little two to three, four second high that you get from your social media app and
[3:21:06.520 --> 3:21:13.440]  the way that we've been conditioned to receive information. And these are very, very complex
[3:21:13.440 --> 3:21:21.920]  geopolitical issues. And what has become clear is that you can't even question America's
[3:21:21.920 --> 3:21:27.640]  involvement in these issues as an American citizen. And that's why I say that the real
[3:21:27.640 --> 3:21:34.000]  battle here, the real battle ultimately is a spiritual one between good and evil. But
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:40.440]  the highest level of the political battle is one between globalism and citizenship.
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:46.440]  And our citizenship is devalued. It really is devalued every time one of these geopolitical
[3:21:46.440 --> 3:21:52.360]  conflicts breaks out. And our government and our corporations, which have merged to make
[3:21:52.360 --> 3:22:00.440]  a corporatocracy, tell citizens that we can't have our own opinion. And there's no bigger
[3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:09.680]  indicator of evil or corruption than contradiction. And I think this Ukraine-Russia conflict has
[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:16.680]  shown us another blatant contradiction on two fronts. One is that if we're going to say
[3:22:16.680 --> 3:22:24.840]  that the threshold for our intervention, whether that be America or NATO in geopolitical affairs
[3:22:24.840 --> 3:22:30.600]  with other countries that aren't involved in the NATO alliance officially because Ukraine
[3:22:30.600 --> 3:22:40.880]  isn't, there has to be a violation of human rights. I'm fine with that. But we have to
[3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:49.880]  be consistent. We have to be consistent in that call for moral and ethical goodness.
[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:56.760]  And obviously what China has done, for example, to the Uyghurs is a prime example of how this
[3:22:56.760 --> 3:23:03.280]  liberal establishment, this neoliberal, globalist, elitist establishment, are very arbitrary
[3:23:03.280 --> 3:23:10.560]  and selective with their moral standards. Because based on the Ukraine and Russia conflict,
[3:23:10.560 --> 3:23:17.000]  we should have invaded East Turkestan, Xinjiang, and China long ago. And not only are we not
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:23.520]  on the brink of any type of military intervention or going into China in any serious way, not
[3:23:23.520 --> 3:23:31.120]  only are we not willing to prosecute China through economic sanctions or even a public
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:38.120]  decry of China's actions, we're not even willing to admit that these things in China are actually
[3:23:38.120 --> 3:23:43.040]  going on. In fact, many liberals in this country and the liberal establishment have given
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:53.480]  China a pass on many fronts to do their ethnic cleansing. And you can see this mirror itself
[3:23:53.480 --> 3:24:01.760]  in the climate lobby, in the climate narrative, in the green initiative, which is going to
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:07.400]  become the left wing dog whistle for authoritarianism. I can promise you that. And Alex Jones
[3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:12.200]  has stressed this for many, many years. And to his credit, I think that he's right over
[3:24:12.200 --> 3:24:21.440]  the target. There is no moral goodness. First and foremost, I would like to say, I do believe
[3:24:21.440 --> 3:24:25.400]  we should be concerned about the climate because I'm a Christian. We should be concerned about
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:31.120]  the planet. God tells us to be good stewards and to have dominion and look after all of
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:36.680]  the creatures in this world that we've been blessed with and given. However, we should
[3:24:36.680 --> 3:24:43.520]  think about how our actions affect future generations around all of our decisions, not just the
[3:24:43.520 --> 3:24:51.280]  climate, not just the earth and its overall health. And what you can see clearly is that
[3:24:51.280 --> 3:24:59.680]  the real green new deal initiative is not one to get rid of pollution. It's one to transport
[3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:05.040]  and export all of our pollution to a country like China. The same thing can be said of
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:10.520]  drilling and the oil or the fossil fuel situation. If we're going to say that pollution is the
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:16.760]  climate and pollution are the highest priority on the list, then we can't do a deal with
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:24.000]  China. And they think so little of the American peoples and common peoples intelligence that
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:29.040]  they can sell us on this BS idea that China is still a developing nation and we have to
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:33.760]  allow them development. And so we have to give them a pass for their pollution as long
[3:25:33.760 --> 3:25:39.760]  as they say that they're trying their best to create renewable energy strategies. Meanwhile,
[3:25:39.760 --> 3:25:48.600]  it leaves America vulnerable economically in terms of national security and morally.
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:53.160]  It leaves us vulnerable because we are telling our people here in America that we should
[3:25:53.160 --> 3:25:59.560]  be anti-American or that we should be a globalist instead of nationalist, which they say is
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:09.240]  just racist, because we're ahead in our development and we should lead the way. Well, let's lead
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:15.120]  the way all the way around the board. Let's lead the way in every aspect. And I believe
[3:26:15.120 --> 3:26:23.640]  wholeheartedly that what Russia is doing is tragic. It's tragic. What's happening between
[3:26:23.640 --> 3:26:28.960]  Russia and the Ukraine is a tragedy. And I think wars happen between kings, not common
[3:26:28.960 --> 3:26:33.920]  people, and a lot of common people suffer when kings decide to go to war. Now, I will
[3:26:33.920 --> 3:26:43.280]  say also to accompany that statement that some wars are justifiable. And I think this
[3:26:43.280 --> 3:26:48.560]  globalist agenda pushes us right to the edge of being able to discern whether or not this
[3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:55.400]  war is justifiable. And I think NATO has gone back on their word a number of times when
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:27:01.680]  it comes to Vladimir Putin and their agreement for them not to put weapons near his border
[3:27:01.680 --> 3:27:13.920]  or our neighboring countries. And whether or not Vladimir Putin is in on it, whether or
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:20.880]  not he's just a little bit hot-tempered and irresponsible, completely psychopathic, none
[3:27:20.880 --> 3:27:30.080]  of that can be easily discerned when we have gone back on our word. And that's the danger
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:36.080]  of colliding forces around the world in times like these and in the fog of war. It's very
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:43.720]  hard to discern. But I do know, I do, I can tell that common people are suffering. And
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:49.240]  it seems that our elites are invested in their own game of geopolitics more so than they
[3:27:49.240 --> 3:27:56.080]  are how it affects the people on the ground. And the same thing can be said here in America
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:28:04.760]  when it comes to our economy. We should, we are an energy-rich nation. We can be self-sufficient
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:13.320]  when it comes to energy. But instead, we've created a narrative to make a moral claim
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:21.760]  around progressive, inclusive, humanitarian politics that we've put the bill on the American
[3:28:21.760 --> 3:28:28.600]  working class. And what's maybe, what's maybe scariest of all is that we as a people have
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:35.520]  become so disconnected and dissatisfied and unfulfilled with genuine education, learning
[3:28:35.520 --> 3:28:41.000]  and knowledge that many of us have bought into this idea. And that's the real, that's
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:48.240]  the real issue that we have to address going forward. I think 2022 as an election and 2024
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:53.680]  are not a referendum on Joe Biden. It's not a referendum on the Democrats. It's not even
[3:28:53.680 --> 3:28:55.880]  a referendum on the globalists.
[3:28:55.880 --> 3:29:02.360]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as
[3:29:02.360 --> 3:29:07.800]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com. Before
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:13.000]  I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:18.200]  going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need,
[3:29:18.200 --> 3:29:22.880]  like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:27.160]  for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then
[3:29:27.160 --> 3:29:33.840]  every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:38.760]  for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support and
[3:29:38.760 --> 3:29:43.480]  extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to
[3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:48.920]  the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force
[3:29:48.920 --> 3:29:53.280]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[3:29:53.280 --> 3:29:56.280]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[3:29:56.280 --> 3:30:00.920]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[3:30:00.920 --> 3:30:07.480]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it comes to information,
[3:30:07.480 --> 3:30:14.600]  boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt into human depopulation, great
[3:30:14.600 --> 3:30:20.760]  recent combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist
[3:30:20.760 --> 3:30:27.280]  nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors
[3:30:27.280 --> 3:30:33.520]  and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their
[3:30:33.520 --> 3:30:38.680]  world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of
[3:30:38.680 --> 3:30:44.200]  it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and
[3:30:44.200 --> 3:30:49.360]  gas lit. And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[3:30:49.360 --> 3:30:53.520]  and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links. That's
[3:30:53.520 --> 3:30:55.880]  why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[3:30:55.880 --> 3:31:01.520]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791. The first
[3:31:01.520 --> 3:31:06.920]  of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means the
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:13.600]  free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint by
[3:31:13.600 --> 3:31:20.440]  the government. 231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious
[3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:26.520]  attack. GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do
[3:31:26.520 --> 3:31:32.600]  not want you to know the truth. I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up
[3:31:32.600 --> 3:31:38.520]  and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth. Would you like to join us?

[3:31:49.520 --> 3:31:56.520]  give and pray. You may select all of those choices. I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[3:32:49.520 --> 3:33:18.520]  Thank you guys again for having me back as a host for this hour. I appreciate the time.
[3:33:18.520 --> 3:33:23.240]  I want to recast this idea that I was playing out before we went to break here. I think
[3:33:23.240 --> 3:33:30.800]  2022 and 2024 are not necessarily a referendum on Joe Biden. It's not a referendum on the
[3:33:30.800 --> 3:33:39.980]  Democrats, the globalists or our elites. This is a referendum on the American people.
[3:33:39.980 --> 3:33:45.200]  We have to decide what kind of country we want to have going forward, what our values
[3:33:45.200 --> 3:33:51.120]  must be, what things we hold dear, what things we actually believe this country can and should
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:34:00.840]  stand for. Right now, we've become victim to a runaway consumerism. We've become victim
[3:34:00.840 --> 3:34:08.920]  to a culture that is conditioned in sin. We have to find faith. We have to find courage
[3:34:08.920 --> 3:34:16.160]  to turn back from that because it's appealing, it's seductive. That's part of the validation,
[3:34:16.160 --> 3:34:26.480]  I believe, of the Bible and of Judeo-Christian history or stories, is that it very, very
[3:34:26.480 --> 3:34:35.000]  accurately points out how seductive and capturing, captivating sin can be. We've all become
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:42.440]  so entrenched in it by and large that it's very hard to even discern the truth anymore
[3:34:42.440 --> 3:34:48.880]  for many people. We don't have any faith. We don't have any faith in our discernment.
[3:34:48.880 --> 3:34:57.720]  We don't have any faith in our gut instincts and our intuition and our consciousness. We're
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:03.120]  being told what to do. We're being told what to do. We're given marching orders and we
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:09.360]  take to it out of fear and out of the fear of the unknown, but also out of the fear
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:15.280]  of being disliked or isolated and rejected from the other members of society who are
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:23.120]  in on the same seduction, who are captured by the same institutions, the same overlords.
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:28.440]  People have to be very, very courageous going into the next chapter of our society or make
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:35.720]  no mistake about it. The vaccine mandates, the social credit scores, the carbon tax,
[3:35:35.720 --> 3:35:44.360]  that's just going to be the beginning. I think ultimately, China is the herald of this new
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:52.080]  world order. People really don't understand that the relationship between the West and
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:36:01.120]  China isn't just an economic quip pro quo. They covet Xi Jinping's authoritarianism.
[3:36:01.120 --> 3:36:07.280]  They covet his dictatorship. They want the West to move further in that direction. It's
[3:36:07.280 --> 3:36:14.320]  not by accident that Wall Street, your black rocks and vanguards and all of these other
[3:36:14.320 --> 3:36:21.600]  big finance institutions have sold us down the river to China and moved our national
[3:36:21.600 --> 3:36:27.520]  identity, our national honor, and our labor and our manufacturing and our ingenuity to
[3:36:27.520 --> 3:36:35.960]  a country that's authoritarian. This is by design. If it isn't by design, if individual
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:42.840]  people are not in on this conspiracy, which it is, then we have to look to the metaphysical
[3:36:42.840 --> 3:36:48.040]  because there's too much evidence, too much momentum in one direction away from what we
[3:36:48.040 --> 3:36:54.440]  say we value as America to ignore. Now, the main problem is that many people don't even
[3:36:54.440 --> 3:37:01.240]  have a very sound belief in what America is. That starts on the education at the educational
[3:37:01.240 --> 3:37:10.360]  level. I think that it's completely absurd and disgusting that we have a mainstream establishment
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:20.080]  that has fought against the exhibiting of national honor in our public schools, but
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:31.160]  promote a guy like Pete Buttigieg's husband leading a pledge to the pride flag for a bunch
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:41.720]  of students. These are dangerous times. These are very, very dangerous times. Part of the
[3:37:41.720 --> 3:37:48.480]  story of Sodom and Gomorrah, God didn't bring the wrath down on Sodom and Gomorrah because
[3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:55.560]  they were sinners because we're all sinners. Any Christian who understands the Christian
[3:37:55.560 --> 3:38:00.480]  faith knows that we're all sinners capable of redemption if we believe in God through
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:05.880]  faith and through real atonement and repentance. The reason why Sodom and Gomorrah were burned
[3:38:05.880 --> 3:38:12.800]  to the ground or were raised to the ground was because they had made sin lawful. They
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:22.120]  had integrated sin into the law. When we play games with our national identity, with this
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:27.760]  beautiful country and nation that is the United States of America and all of its incredible
[3:38:27.760 --> 3:38:35.680]  history and its incredible impact on the global society, which is profound and really great,
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:45.640]  a miracle to be quite honest. We allow cultural hijackers to say America's inherently racist,
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:50.840]  America's inherently evil, and we're going to substitute our national honor and the
[3:38:50.840 --> 3:38:58.800]  Pledge of Allegiance to our national honor for Pledge of Allegiance to the pride flag.
[3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:08.360]  This is as dangerous a cultural idea as you could possibly imagine because when we said
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:15.320]  separation of church and state, for example, I think there was great utility to that because
[3:39:15.320 --> 3:39:20.880]  I don't believe that faith in God means faith in the church, although I am a Catholic, but
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:26.320]  I do understand that members and individuals within the church have the potential and often
[3:39:26.320 --> 3:39:33.560]  do end up corrupt and succumbing to sin and corruption, just as they explained in the
[3:39:33.560 --> 3:39:39.760]  Bible of the Pharisees and the times of Jesus and in many other times throughout history.
[3:39:39.760 --> 3:39:48.240]  But I will say that it doesn't seem by accident that we bought into the separation of church
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:56.640]  and state only to turn around shortly thereafter and sort of institute a church of atheism or
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:40:04.400]  a church of LGBTQ and make no mistake about it. If we can't teach religion in schools,
[3:40:04.400 --> 3:40:12.640]  if we can't teach about faith in schools with confidence, then we shouldn't be able to teach
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:26.760]  an ideology of LGBTQ beliefs or Marxist beliefs or communist beliefs. All of these ideas and
[3:40:26.760 --> 3:40:33.840]  any idea, any ideology has the potential to become religious depending on how it's taught
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:39.920]  and how people are taught to engage with it and make no mistake about it. The LGBTQ community
[3:40:39.920 --> 3:40:46.160]  does have a right to have sex with who they want. They have a right to love who they want.
[3:40:46.160 --> 3:40:53.600]  They have a right to engage with other individuals the way they want. That's America. They don't
[3:40:53.600 --> 3:40:59.320]  need any more special classification from this government in order to do so. And we
[3:40:59.320 --> 3:41:10.120]  can't in any way explain with good decency and reason how denouncing America or replacing
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:20.200]  our national honor with an LGBTQ ideology is anything but heresy. And it is a heresy.
[3:41:20.200 --> 3:41:26.640]  But it's not just the LGBTQs fault and it's not just the Democrats fault. There is a wide
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:38.320]  spread lack of faith in God. There's a wide spread rise of atheism. And it goes further.
[3:41:38.320 --> 3:41:43.280]  I don't think that we're just lacking faith. I don't think that we're just atheists and
[3:41:43.280 --> 3:41:50.600]  don't believe in God. We've become anti-God. There's a seductiveness. There's a utility
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:59.440]  in our day in being anti-God. There are many treasures to obtain in being anti-God to
[3:41:59.440 --> 3:42:05.520]  being anti-Christ. And you can see it right out in the open. And people will admit it.
[3:42:05.520 --> 3:42:13.280]  And people will try and berate you for your belief in God in our time. I'm going through
[3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:19.160]  it now from both sides of the aisle in some respects. But I do think that our Republican
[3:42:19.160 --> 3:42:26.960]  Party is the party of God. I think the Republican Party has to stand up and take the reins and
[3:42:26.960 --> 3:42:33.600]  proclaim their faith in God, proclaim that this country was founded on Judeo-Christian
[3:42:33.600 --> 3:42:40.760]  values and that there's real utility to Judeo-Christian values and morals and ethics that supersede
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:45.560]  even the Constitution that are baked into the Constitution. Now, that doesn't mean we
[3:42:45.560 --> 3:42:55.120]  need a theocracy here in America, but we certainly can't be 100% rejecting of the
[3:42:55.120 --> 3:43:20.200]  system.
[3:43:20.200 --> 3:43:25.440]  crew are. So again, both these products are back in stock, both X3 and Winter Sun. They
[3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:32.400]  are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price I would estimate
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:37.320]  in less than a month. So this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens
[3:43:37.320 --> 3:43:41.520]  versus the bad halogens. This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with
[3:43:41.520 --> 3:43:45.200]  vitamin K for your immune system as well. They're amazing and they're an info wars
[3:43:45.200 --> 3:43:50.960]  store.com. The reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation. I need funds to run
[3:43:50.960 --> 3:43:55.000]  the operation. You need to be healthy. We need to stay on air. It's a match made in heaven.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:02.040]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault
[3:44:02.040 --> 3:44:11.840]  on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead. The days of independent
[3:44:11.840 --> 3:44:17.020]  media are numbered. The government has made it illegal to oppose them. They are now deep
[3:44:17.020 --> 3:44:23.040]  banking us behind the scenes. They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly with
[3:44:23.040 --> 3:44:28.800]  practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps. The traders
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:34.640]  know they can shut us down by force, but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[3:44:34.640 --> 3:44:41.080]  So be it. Make them silence us by force. This is the final battle of the information war.
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:49.160]  Give now. Buy products. Donate. Before everything changes. We need you to carry us through to
[3:44:49.160 --> 3:44:56.600]  the end. Victory or death. Go now to infowarstore.com.
[3:44:56.600 --> 3:45:01.280]  Alex Jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:07.560]  viewers. If you will simply get X3 with all three types of good eye and eye, that boosts
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:12.320]  your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level. It
[3:45:12.320 --> 3:45:16.920]  will change your life. It will invigorate you. It will empower you. Almost everyone
[3:45:16.920 --> 3:45:21.920]  has eye and eye deficiency. Look into it for yourself. It's the opposite of fluoride. It's
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:28.640]  the good halogen. And then your purchase of X3 funds our operation. Now a lot of our products
[3:45:28.640 --> 3:45:32.480]  have been sold out and never came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain break
[3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:37.760]  announced. We were sold out of X3 for a long time. And I had it on sale for 50% off. A
[3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:40.680]  lot of folks were getting it. And I was thinking, you know what? I'm going to bring it back
[3:45:40.680 --> 3:45:45.160]  on sale again just until it sells out. Because even though we won't make as much money in
[3:45:45.160 --> 3:45:49.280]  the long run, a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales
[3:45:49.280 --> 3:45:54.320]  in now to stay on air. See your X3 right now at 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[3:45:54.320 --> 3:45:58.280]  With the world awakening, I think what's important that we were right there for better
[3:45:58.280 --> 3:46:02.720]  right now, take advantage of this moment. And I've always had an idea that something
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:05.280]  everybody can do, but every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:10.480]  us to hang banners over highways. Imagine a champagne or a pizza that I lay up in. It
[3:46:10.480 --> 3:46:15.400]  says Alex George is right. infowarstore.com. We stand with the truckers or rest out or
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:19.640]  whatever. Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this. Yes. Now is the time in
[3:46:19.640 --> 3:46:23.800]  your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall or to put a
[3:46:23.800 --> 3:46:29.800]  sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction. What do you
[3:46:29.800 --> 3:46:33.800]  recommend people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all, I'll just
[3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:38.720]  just want you to form a rest out, a rest out swap. The vaccine is poison. There's kinds
[3:46:38.720 --> 3:46:42.960]  of things I say, just keep it short. Keep it concise. Don't agree. A rest Fauci, a rest
[3:46:42.960 --> 3:46:47.600]  Bill Gates, the COVID-vaxx is poison. Beautiful. Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved
[3:46:47.600 --> 3:46:51.160]  if we could all be effective. So that's what I'm calling about. God bless you, Chris.
[3:46:51.160 --> 3:46:57.760]  In Atlanta. I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so much.
[3:46:57.760 --> 3:47:04.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[3:47:04.480 --> 3:47:16.840]  Again, I'm very thankful to be here on info wars as a guest host in this hour. I appreciate
[3:47:16.840 --> 3:47:22.160]  the time so much and my good friend, Alex Jones for allowing me this time to talk to
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:30.080]  his audience. Look, I laid out the spiritual. I laid out the spiritual war, right? And ultimately
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:36.960]  that's where we have to find our faith and our strength. I laid out the geopolitical
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:45.080]  war between globalism and citizens, free people all around the world. But now let's talk about
[3:47:45.080 --> 3:47:49.760]  how the global affects the local. We have to talk about America and being America first,
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:55.880]  because I do believe that America and American citizenship is the first line of defense against
[3:47:55.880 --> 3:48:04.720]  tyranny. This is why I'm running for Congress. Congress is in charge of regulating the Fed.
[3:48:04.720 --> 3:48:14.520]  Okay, Congress has to get a hold by some miracle of us electing America first candidates into
[3:48:14.520 --> 3:48:20.760]  our Congress. Congress has to get a hold of the Fed because these people won't stop themselves.
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:28.240]  These globalist, elitist, anti-American sellouts will not stop until the $20 bill in everybody's
[3:48:28.240 --> 3:48:34.560]  pocket is worth a penny. And listen, they don't just want the middle class. They want
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:39.920]  the middle market as well. They won't stop until the middle class is destroyed, the middle
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:46.800]  market is destroyed, and all that's left are big box corporations. We have to get a hold
[3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:52.720]  of the Fed. We have to have a Congress that has the courage to get a hold of the Fed and
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:49:00.600]  balance this budget. The Fed and these corporate elites are stealing from us. They're stealing
[3:49:00.600 --> 3:49:06.400]  from our future generations. They're stealing from our grandkids, grandkids. Okay, when
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:12.760]  you spend, when you deficit spend, that's stealing. And like I said earlier, when your
[3:49:12.760 --> 3:49:20.560]  government steals, everybody steals. We have to get a hold of this right now. This can't
[3:49:20.560 --> 3:49:27.840]  wait. And if we do, if we're able to get a hold of the Fed and balance our budget by
[3:49:27.840 --> 3:49:33.920]  bringing American manufacturing back home, by bringing our essential antibiotics back
[3:49:33.920 --> 3:49:41.040]  home, by tapping into the energy, the rich energy that we have within our own borders,
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:47.800]  by getting control on the free movement of illegal immigration at our borders, we can
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:54.280]  actually increase the value of our citizenship again. We can actually have an ROI citizenship,
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:49:58.760]  a return on investment citizenship. Right now, the way we're going, our citizens are
[3:49:58.760 --> 3:50:03.960]  going to be in the hole for this generation and many future generations to come and serve
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:09.080]  them as their, is their ultimate plan, serve them as their ultimate idea that you're going
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:15.320]  to own nothing and be happy mantra on top of saying, we're going to make the material
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:20.760]  high so good that you don't know we're stealing. Ultimately, they just want to take the welfare
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:29.120]  system and, and, and blow it up into this dystopian high tech subscription model for
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:35.760]  everyone. And we have to, in order to address this, in order to have the motivation and
[3:50:35.760 --> 3:50:42.000]  the discernment and the courage to address this issue, we have to understand that the
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:49.560]  great trick that's been played on us is that there's a way to cheat and win in life. You
[3:50:49.560 --> 3:50:53.640]  can't cheat your way to win it. You can't cheat your way to meaning. You can't cheat
[3:50:53.640 --> 3:50:58.120]  your way to fulfillment. There's something meaningful about a hard day's work. And we've
[3:50:58.120 --> 3:51:04.680]  been lost in capitalism. We've lost ourselves in capitalism, which has really become crony
[3:51:04.680 --> 3:51:09.800]  capitalism where we think that it's, that it's actually par for the course for us to
[3:51:09.800 --> 3:51:15.640]  cheat in order to win. Now I'm not saying that we should be in favor of communism. That's,
[3:51:15.640 --> 3:51:22.080]  that's the wrong approach. That's the wrong adjustment. Communism should be a non-starter.
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:28.680]  No communism should ever make its way to be the header of this great nation, full stop.
[3:51:28.680 --> 3:51:35.360]  But we have to constantly adjust the capitalism that we've built alongside of morals and ethics.
[3:51:35.360 --> 3:51:41.040]  And when we don't, we condition ourselves to be the slaves and the drones for a very
[3:51:41.040 --> 3:51:45.560]  corrupt player. And I know the audience that I'm talking to now is like preaching to the
[3:51:45.560 --> 3:51:50.560]  choir, but I'm sure because I'm running for Congress and many people will say that, that
[3:51:50.560 --> 3:51:57.480]  I am aligning myself with conspiracy theorists like an Alex Jones. Alex Jones, as many of
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:52:03.320]  you know, has been right many more times than he's been wrong. And we are all wrong at some
[3:52:03.320 --> 3:52:07.920]  point. I've been wrong. Any person who's ever lived on this planet has been wrong.
[3:52:07.920 --> 3:52:15.080]  But the question is, who benefits? And when they say the follow the money, there's some
[3:52:15.080 --> 3:52:21.520]  real truth to that. But there's more benefits than money. Who benefits from the American
[3:52:21.520 --> 3:52:27.040]  public being dumbed down? Who benefits from the American public not believing that there
[3:52:27.040 --> 3:52:34.080]  are groups of people, very powerful, intergenerational, evil people who don't have to worry about
[3:52:34.080 --> 3:52:43.360]  money that are able to collaborate and undermine the civility, the integrity and the faith
[3:52:43.360 --> 3:52:50.520]  of this great nation and its people? Who benefits from that? The answer is very clear. If you
[3:52:50.520 --> 3:52:55.600]  follow the money, if you follow the trail of blood, the trail of contradiction, the trail
[3:52:55.600 --> 3:53:00.920]  of lies, it becomes very clear who benefits. My opponent, who I'll be running against here
[3:53:00.920 --> 3:53:07.240]  in CD five and the congressional race, Ilhan Omar, she benefits. She benefits from being
[3:53:07.240 --> 3:53:14.640]  married and divorcing her husband and then marrying a new man who's in on the political
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:22.920]  apparatus and gets paid from her congressional funds. And that's legal, right? There's legality
[3:53:22.920 --> 3:53:30.720]  to it. But who benefits? Who benefits when Ilhan Omar says we have to be conscious of
[3:53:30.720 --> 3:53:35.800]  the human rights violations of China. But then when the bill passes that President Trump
[3:53:35.800 --> 3:53:42.640]  wanted to bring more sanctions down upon China, she says we have to go softer on China. We
[3:53:42.640 --> 3:53:48.320]  can't risk starting a cold war. Well, there are some wars that are justified. There are
[3:53:48.320 --> 3:53:53.440]  some wars that are righteous and divine, and America has fought them in the past, and America
[3:53:53.440 --> 3:53:58.800]  will have to fight them again. We have to understand that in order for America to remain
[3:53:58.800 --> 3:54:05.640]  America, in order for us to keep what's good and what's vital for America, for Americans,
[3:54:05.640 --> 3:54:12.400]  there are forces outside of America and within that look to take that from us. And we have
[3:54:12.400 --> 3:54:18.280]  to prepare ourselves for the very real possibility that a war may need to be fought in order
[3:54:18.280 --> 3:54:24.480]  to save this country. That's not far-fetched. It's not far-fetched at all. That's not an
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:31.320]  extreme or radical idea. We fight plenty of wars to try and confiscate natural resources
[3:54:31.320 --> 3:54:38.300]  and other kinds of things from places all around the world. So we seem to have a very
[3:54:38.300 --> 3:54:44.120]  blatant contradiction there again in our culture where we say war is only okay when the kings
[3:54:44.120 --> 3:54:49.240]  and the elites of our country decide that there's something valuable they can obtain
[3:54:49.240 --> 3:54:57.520]  through it. Do the people often get to decide whether or not we go to war? No. Do the people
[3:54:57.520 --> 3:55:03.040]  have much say in the bombs that we drop every day around the world? No. No. No, our military
[3:55:03.040 --> 3:55:10.840]  action is very seldomly been in the interest of the American people. Sure, they fly the
[3:55:10.840 --> 3:55:21.320]  banner of national security, democracy, freedom, and other catch words and buzz words or talking
[3:55:21.320 --> 3:55:28.640]  points. But the reality is that the American people have become disconnected from power,
[3:55:28.640 --> 3:55:34.040]  that our citizenship has become disconnected from power. We are not, we are not we the
[3:55:34.040 --> 3:55:39.800]  people right now in this country. And this goes out to, this is a message to everyone
[3:55:39.800 --> 3:55:46.480]  beyond the Allege Jones audience and Info Wars audience who I know will also be listening.
[3:55:46.480 --> 3:55:52.440]  Where is your self-respect? Where is your pride? And I don't mean pride like the seven,
[3:55:52.440 --> 3:55:58.560]  you know, the one of the seven deadly sins pride. I mean pride based on faith, pride
[3:55:58.560 --> 3:56:05.360]  based on understanding and goodness and moral clarity. Where is our pride as a nation? Our
[3:56:05.360 --> 3:56:11.200]  individual citizens know that we are being scammed. The question is who's ignorant to
[3:56:11.200 --> 3:56:17.080]  it and who's in on it. And when I say in on it, I mean there are those who are scamming
[3:56:17.080 --> 3:56:22.120]  us who conspire to scam us. And there are those of us who like the high so much that
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:26.760]  we can't find the energy or the courage to stand up to this. That's why people are voting
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:33.640]  Democrat. That's why people are voting for a party that continuously govern in opposition
[3:56:33.640 --> 3:56:41.180]  of their interests. That's why people are buying and voting against their own self interests.
[3:56:41.180 --> 3:56:46.920]  Because they like the high that's provided to them by this establishment, by the status
[3:56:46.920 --> 3:56:54.000]  quo, by the centrists. We have to pull back from this. And under no circumstances can
[3:56:54.000 --> 3:57:00.880]  we make a claim about human welfare, humanitarianism, or just being human. If we can't find the
[3:57:00.880 --> 3:57:07.360]  courage to reject evil, to reject sin, to reject the indulgence and all of these hypermaterial
[3:57:07.360 --> 3:57:13.960]  things in the interest of a greater good of a higher calling. And I know all of my socialist
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:20.000]  democratic communists Marxist counterparts will sell people on the idea that inclusivity
[3:57:20.000 --> 3:57:25.400]  and intersectionality is all about trying to create a better standard of living for everyone
[3:57:25.400 --> 3:57:33.040]  in this country. But it's not true. And look at the proof. Even if we go to universal income,
[3:57:33.040 --> 3:57:38.080]  the universal income isn't going to give you any ownership. It's not going to give you
[3:57:38.080 --> 3:57:43.280]  a stake in a stakeholder society. They're going to give you just enough to continue to get
[3:57:43.280 --> 3:57:44.280]  high.
[3:57:44.280 --> 3:57:52.000]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth. And the
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:59.200]  next big casualty isn't even the people that died. No, that invariably follows. But first
[3:57:59.200 --> 3:58:07.000]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[3:58:07.000 --> 3:58:12.640]  And now across the world, from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[3:58:12.640 --> 3:58:21.320]  that if you amplify any quote pro Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[3:58:21.320 --> 3:58:26.680]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned. And of course, now Canada is under this legislation
[3:58:26.680 --> 3:58:32.800]  that if you have a thought crime, and they think you may have the intent to engage in
[3:58:32.800 --> 3:58:38.480]  hate speech online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism
[3:58:38.480 --> 3:58:43.800]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes InfoWars.com
[3:58:43.800 --> 3:58:46.360]  more important than ever.
