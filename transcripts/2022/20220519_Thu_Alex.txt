[00:00.000 --> 00:20.000]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.240]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[00:26.240 --> 00:27.240]  be followed.
[00:27.240 --> 00:33.400]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for
[00:33.400 --> 00:35.720]  launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:35.720 --> 00:42.080]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[00:42.080 --> 00:44.000]  like any other attack.
[00:44.000 --> 00:49.040]  We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[00:49.040 --> 00:54.120]  They are voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for
[00:54.120 --> 00:55.840]  Hillary, it's war.
[00:55.840 --> 01:00.920]  We came, we saw, we died.
[01:00.920 --> 01:03.120]  With her, you'll end up in world war three.
[01:03.120 --> 01:06.920]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.120]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to
[01:12.120 --> 01:16.680]  go to war against Syria and Russia.
[01:16.680 --> 01:21.160]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2.
[01:21.160 --> 01:27.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.240]  reports of further hacking.
[01:29.240 --> 01:31.360]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[01:31.360 --> 01:33.360]  Well, of course not, because she's...
[01:33.360 --> 01:35.360]  Look, that's a really loud noise.
[01:35.360 --> 01:40.360]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[01:40.360 --> 01:46.520]  We'll try to get Leigh Ann back on in a few minutes.
[01:46.520 --> 01:55.200]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[01:55.200 --> 02:19.000]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace, St. Narada's Declare DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:19.000 --> 02:22.680]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[02:22.680 --> 02:27.400]  The bomber spends all its time thinking about World War II.
[02:27.400 --> 02:30.800]  Target selection complete, time on target sequence complete.
[02:30.800 --> 02:39.040]  22 Typhoon-class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[02:39.040 --> 02:43.600]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.680]  From the front lines of the information war.
[02:47.680 --> 02:49.960]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[02:49.960 --> 02:53.640]  We are at DEF CON 1.
[02:53.640 --> 02:56.120]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.120]  You bet!
[02:57.120 --> 03:01.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[03:01.480 --> 03:04.840]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[03:04.840 --> 03:11.920]  Three, two, one, impact shall we play a game.
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.680]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[03:17.680 --> 03:22.560]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:22.560 --> 03:26.480]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready awaiting launch codes.
[03:26.480 --> 03:28.120]  We are in launch mode.
[03:28.120 --> 03:31.960]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[03:31.960 --> 03:36.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:36.400 --> 03:37.880]  We're in.
[03:37.880 --> 03:39.680]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[03:39.680 --> 03:42.200]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.240]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[03:44.240 --> 03:46.240]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[03:46.240 --> 04:01.800]  The same to be said, the only winning goal is not to grab.
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.760]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[04:07.760 --> 04:10.720]  and chemicals added to the food to all come out.
[04:10.720 --> 04:14.240]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made the image of
[04:14.240 --> 04:20.520]  God, the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[04:20.520 --> 04:24.920]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[04:24.920 --> 04:28.720]  with the boy, is it true?
[04:28.720 --> 04:34.560]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[04:34.560 --> 04:38.360]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.880]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[04:44.880 --> 04:46.880]  of this world who is a loser.
[04:46.880 --> 04:50.800]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Info Wars in the air now more than ever.
[04:50.800 --> 04:55.040]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.480]  up is satanic and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the B stages.
[05:00.480 --> 05:06.480]  Here at Info Wars, our slogan is tomorrow's news today, whether it's politics or health
[05:06.480 --> 05:13.240]  or spirituality, we're about bringing you the very best documented, accurate real world
[05:13.240 --> 05:14.240]  information.
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.480]  And when it comes to our supplements, they are so game changing for your body, for your
[05:18.480 --> 05:22.520]  health, your immunity, your libido, your middle clarity.
[05:22.520 --> 05:23.520]  They're incredible.
[05:23.520 --> 05:27.520]  And out of all the products, X2 is definitely the most amazing.
[05:27.520 --> 05:32.320]  It is the purest, highest quality, atomic iodine you're going to find.
[05:32.320 --> 05:37.800]  Each other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb
[05:37.800 --> 05:40.000]  it at all or fully.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply and it's been sold out for months because
[05:43.240 --> 05:44.920]  supply chain right downs.
[05:44.920 --> 05:49.840]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week than it goes back to full
[05:49.840 --> 05:50.840]  price.
[05:50.840 --> 05:53.840]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[05:53.840 --> 05:57.320]  Experience X2 for yourself today at infowarsstore.com.
[05:57.320 --> 06:04.320]  Take action now.
[06:04.320 --> 06:14.840]  1984 is 1776.
[06:14.840 --> 06:27.280]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective.
[06:27.280 --> 06:37.560]  The great awakening is here, go to fan.video, download the videos and share.
[06:37.560 --> 06:52.560]  Support the information war at infowarsstore.com and never give up the fight.
[06:52.560 --> 07:11.040]  Next week in Geneva, Switzerland, members of the World Health Organization, which was
[07:11.040 --> 07:16.000]  founded on the principles of establishing a one-world government, will be voting to
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.800]  give themselves worldwide authority when it comes to official international health emergencies.
[07:22.800 --> 07:29.560]  The same World Health Organization who praised Communist China's extreme authoritarian lockdown
[07:29.560 --> 07:35.880]  against the Chinese people, who suggested forcibly separating families to quarantine
[07:35.880 --> 07:36.880]  them.
[07:36.880 --> 07:41.480]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening
[07:41.480 --> 07:46.440]  in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[07:46.440 --> 07:51.000]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family
[07:51.000 --> 07:52.000]  units.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.400]  Now, we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.760]  them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[08:02.760 --> 08:08.080]  And who was caught faking the H1N1 pandemic in 2010.
[08:08.080 --> 08:14.080]  The same World Health Organization run by Tadros Adonam Gibrasis, who's been working
[08:14.080 --> 08:19.560]  with the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation since 2007, who
[08:19.560 --> 08:22.440]  said that the lockdowns will never end.
[08:22.440 --> 08:28.200]  I repeat, there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[08:28.200 --> 08:34.080]  And that the war in Ukraine was getting massive attention as a result of bias against black
[08:34.080 --> 08:35.080]  lives.
[08:35.080 --> 08:40.880]  The U.S. government is in full support of this new U.N. treaty with the WHO and has
[08:40.880 --> 08:47.960]  submitted 13 amendments, which will be voted on next week, that will give the WHO international
[08:47.960 --> 08:53.720]  authority on lockdowns, forced quarantines, and forced vaccinations.
[08:53.720 --> 08:58.520]  According to constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, none of this is legally binding until
[08:58.520 --> 09:01.400]  a treaty is approved by the U.S. Senate.
[09:01.400 --> 09:06.480]  But the law hasn't been stopping these criminals from committing crimes against humanity so
[09:06.480 --> 09:07.480]  far.
[09:07.480 --> 09:12.000]  And if they plan on staying in power, they're going to have to bring back the lockdowns
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.400]  and the ballot-harvesting mules.
[09:14.400 --> 09:19.960]  So we know it's coming, and it will soon be climate lockdowns to go with their climate
[09:19.960 --> 09:21.560]  migration.
[09:21.560 --> 09:26.800]  People are waking up, but the U.N.'s agenda is aggressively pressing forward.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.600]  The United Nations is meeting this week with members of the Mayor's Migration Council,
[09:31.600 --> 09:37.080]  which is comprised of nine mayors from nine different cities throughout the world, including
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.840]  Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, California.
[09:40.840 --> 09:47.720]  The Mayor's Migration Council is funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundations, sponsored
[09:47.720 --> 09:52.200]  by the Rockefeller Foundation, and partnered with the United Nations.
[09:52.200 --> 09:54.760]  And their stated goal is pretty clear.
[09:54.760 --> 10:00.040]  They want to grant mayors the ability to bypass state and federal government when it comes
[10:00.040 --> 10:06.080]  to what they call climate migration and go straight to international organizations for
[10:06.080 --> 10:07.320]  resources.
[10:07.320 --> 10:13.200]  They are inviting all interested mayors or senior city staff members to contact them
[10:13.200 --> 10:19.800]  at contact at mayorsmigrationcouncil.org to learn how to engage with the international
[10:19.800 --> 10:25.480]  system and learn how to get funding and boots on the ground support.
[10:25.480 --> 10:29.840]  This all sounds completely illegal, but who's going to stop them?
[10:29.840 --> 10:35.520]  There is no longer any justice in America, so expect more lockdowns as the food supply
[10:35.520 --> 10:42.280]  diminishes and the population around you surges with hungry foreign migrants.
[10:42.280 --> 10:58.920]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.520]  350 million or more people in Africa, and then 12 die of Ebola in one little town.
[11:03.520 --> 11:07.680]  They go, oh, Ebola, Ebola, Ebola, Ebola.
[11:07.680 --> 11:13.320]  And they had CNN people saying, diseases will be coming out of the rainforest because Mother
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.760]  Earth is mad, literally like witch doctors going, booga booga, some not come back.
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.520]  You know, when we have floods and rain and meteors might hit the earth, what if a meteor
[11:22.520 --> 11:23.960]  hits the earth tomorrow and destroys a city?
[11:23.960 --> 11:27.040]  Are they going to say this is because the people of earth have been mad?
[11:27.040 --> 11:28.840]  That meteor just came from space.
[11:28.840 --> 11:31.280]  It's very primitive control apparatus.
[11:31.280 --> 11:35.280]  It's how chiefs and medicine doctors used to control and shaman would control people
[11:35.280 --> 11:37.320]  saying, oh, if you're not good, the crops won't come.
[11:37.320 --> 11:39.360]  Oh, the environment, if we're not good.
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.680]  I don't want to eat a piece of meat that's got dioxins in it from plastics production.
[11:43.680 --> 11:51.520]  I don't want them dumping nickel cadmium and heavy metal grignard reagents in the waters.
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.640]  So my kids are deformed.
[11:52.640 --> 11:53.640]  I don't want that.
[11:53.640 --> 11:54.640]  I'm from the environment.
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.400]  But these international corrupt people financing global population control, which is just nothing
[11:59.400 --> 12:03.160]  more but dictators' excuses to kill men, women, and children, and girls and slave labor
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.640]  camps in China making nikes.
[12:05.640 --> 12:09.840]  You call that good, and all these Hollywood people that say they love you are the ones
[12:09.840 --> 12:13.600]  that speak out against slave labor, are the ones you find out later, are the ones that
[12:13.600 --> 12:16.360]  own all the sweatshops, making their clothes lines.
[12:16.360 --> 12:18.400]  They're all hypocrites.
[12:18.400 --> 12:21.280]  They're all hypocrites using you.
[12:21.280 --> 12:23.880]  So here it is, global plan to fight infectious diseases sought.
[12:23.880 --> 12:29.400]  I haven't read this yet, but Washington, a new plan to coordinate international efforts
[12:29.400 --> 12:34.400]  to track and combat infectious diseases will be announcing by the leaders of the G7 group
[12:34.400 --> 12:37.680]  of industrial nations at this weekend's summit in Denver.
[12:37.680 --> 12:43.880]  White House Aids said Monday, and the combustion engine is the greatest threat to civilization,
[12:43.880 --> 12:45.840]  like Al Gore says on Earth and the Balance.
[12:45.840 --> 12:52.800]  No, Mr. Gore, the combustion engine is civilization, and the combustion engine's getting cleaned
[12:52.800 --> 12:58.320]  up, because we're putting catalytic converters on the cars, just like we got the horses out
[12:58.320 --> 13:02.200]  of the streets a hundred years ago, and we don't have a horse manure problem anymore.
[13:02.200 --> 13:03.920]  Humans move forward.
[13:03.920 --> 13:06.260]  I know the bureaucrats don't want that.
[13:06.260 --> 13:08.160]  You want us to stay down and lonely.
[13:08.160 --> 13:16.840]  You don't want us to transcend, do you?
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.160]  The majority of the elite are leaning towards, this is a public declaration, towards the
[13:21.160 --> 13:24.960]  orderly extermination of the mass.
[13:24.960 --> 13:30.120]  They're not going to just have big robotic factories making brain pods, you know, iPods
[13:30.120 --> 13:34.120]  that go, that plug right into your head, or right through the neural network, right through
[13:34.120 --> 13:35.640]  your eyes.
[13:35.640 --> 13:39.720]  They're not going to get, you're not going to have that, you're not going to get that.
[13:39.720 --> 13:42.920]  You're not going to get life extension technologies, when they're six and a half billion, going
[13:42.920 --> 14:01.120]  to be eight billion, by the time they've really got that shirt up.
[14:01.120 --> 14:07.720]  The elite, I understand, Rourke, you heard about free supply, you heard about mechanized
[14:07.720 --> 14:13.000]  robotic factories so advanced that you will be able to lay around on your hind end all
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.520]  day, and that is actually coming in the manufacturing industrial singularity.
[14:19.520 --> 14:25.160]  There will be many singularities, different steps towards the true singularity, which
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.080]  is a mathematical fact, and you better not want the singularity because it means the
[14:29.080 --> 14:32.200]  end of the species, and it means not even being able to grasp.
[14:32.200 --> 14:36.900]  You know, there is no one on the earth who can grasp all the computer technological systems
[14:36.900 --> 14:43.160]  and how they interface and how they run, and what's happened is humans and human technicians
[14:43.160 --> 14:52.160]  and computer scientists man and oversee with an organic augmentation the computing systems
[14:52.160 --> 14:57.520]  and the artificial neural networks that have been created, and they oversee their different
[14:57.520 --> 15:02.960]  sciences and then attempt to merge those together and are building computer systems that compute
[15:02.960 --> 15:07.760]  and integrate and design other computers, and it's basically already, with the technology
[15:07.760 --> 15:13.760]  we know about, not just the suppressed technology, but the technology that we know about, basically
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.200]  already out of human hands.
[15:15.200 --> 15:22.000]  We might, if we had a full conscience movement towards full disclosure and investigation and
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.120]  control be able to slow this down.
[15:25.120 --> 15:28.080]  You know, in the past it took a hundred years for major developments to happen.
[15:28.080 --> 15:31.760]  Now it's happening every six months.
[15:31.760 --> 15:38.520]  So yes, the elite made the decision as early as I can tell about 80 years ago that manufacturing
[15:38.520 --> 15:46.040]  in the future, and they even successfully predicted when that would be, turn to the
[15:46.040 --> 15:55.320]  new century, that they will be able to build robotic mind systems, robotic delivery systems
[15:55.320 --> 15:56.320]  that will even deliver.
[15:56.320 --> 15:57.320]  We're going to be right back folks.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.320]  Stay with us.
[15:58.320 --> 16:03.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra 12, the highest quality B12 you're going to find on the market,
[16:03.960 --> 16:08.200]  has been sold out for many months, but now it's back in stock at infostore.com.
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.120]  Now in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B12, but do your own research
[16:13.120 --> 16:19.760]  and realize when it is organic, high quality vitamin B12, it energizes every other vitamin
[16:19.760 --> 16:23.760]  mineral in your body and all of your hormones and so much more.
[16:23.760 --> 16:25.480]  Ultra 12 is incredible.
[16:25.480 --> 16:29.560]  Take it out of the tongue, so it's better absorption into your body, and it is a game
[16:29.560 --> 16:30.560]  changer.

[18:12.680 --> 18:17.560]  so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they
[18:17.560 --> 18:20.200]  can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[18:20.200 --> 18:23.440]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our

[18:38.120 --> 18:39.520]  all be gone and they'll be history.

[18:48.960 --> 18:54.040]  historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[18:54.040 --> 19:02.880]  I want to thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com.
[19:02.880 --> 19:06.400]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[19:06.400 --> 19:11.480]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products, I am a granny, and we're all
[19:11.480 --> 19:15.880]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me.
[19:15.880 --> 19:21.080]  I was loaded up with sunspots, or H-spots, as they're lovingly called, but since taking
[19:21.080 --> 19:26.280]  your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[19:26.280 --> 19:32.400]  People think I'm 55 years old, and I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[19:32.400 --> 19:36.160]  you know, well maybe that's what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless
[19:36.160 --> 19:40.520]  situation, but when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately, but you
[19:40.520 --> 19:46.120]  know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is the ticket, this is
[19:46.120 --> 19:52.200]  working, this is wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know,
[19:52.200 --> 20:01.440]  so anyway, it worked wonderfully, and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[20:01.440 --> 20:28.120]  Here I am, in the year 2002, laying out, we are now living, the open world government
[20:28.120 --> 20:33.320]  is now been announced, and it's in game, is complete and total shutdown of civilization
[20:33.320 --> 20:40.920]  as we know it in mass death, prepare yourselves, and resist with everything you've got, be
[20:40.920 --> 20:46.640]  as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves, but fight like your life depends on it, in
[20:46.640 --> 20:51.760]  the information war peacefully, but warn the world, if you think things are bad now, they're
[20:51.760 --> 20:54.440]  about to get a thousand times worse.
[20:54.440 --> 20:58.960]  Yes and common sense are in, yes there have been corrupt empires, yes they manipulate,
[20:58.960 --> 21:03.280]  yes there are secret societies, yes there have been oligarchies throughout history,
[21:03.280 --> 21:11.120]  and yes today in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the new world order,
[21:11.120 --> 21:19.000]  pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete
[21:19.000 --> 21:25.800]  tyranny, where human beings are absolutely worthless, there's six and a quarter plus
[21:25.800 --> 21:29.960]  billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're
[21:29.960 --> 21:34.940]  causing a problem, we need to be cold at the tune of 80 percent, it's amazing to talk
[21:34.940 --> 21:39.160]  about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've
[21:39.160 --> 21:46.400]  convinced a lot of liberals and elitist conservatives and others that by going along with this,
[21:46.400 --> 21:54.720]  we're intelligent members of society, it's the ultimate mouth-less world view, it is
[21:54.720 --> 22:05.040]  this radical virulent form of social Darwinism, it's the excuse of tyrants, and by creating
[22:05.040 --> 22:09.480]  open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the
[22:09.480 --> 22:16.640]  resources, by centralizing and socializing healthcare, the state becomes God basically
[22:16.640 --> 22:21.680]  when it comes to your health, and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.600]  upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[22:26.600 --> 22:34.960]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I normally play new breaking news and promos at the start
[22:34.960 --> 22:37.520]  of the show because I think that's some of the most important information we have, Greg
[22:37.520 --> 22:42.640]  Rees reports and others, but today I got in here about an hour before, I've been getting
[22:42.640 --> 22:45.720]  ready for hours at home and I was going over all the news and getting ready for what I
[22:45.720 --> 22:49.240]  was going to cover, the whole world government announcement and what the end game of that
[22:49.240 --> 22:54.400]  world government is publicly, and the key word, global Marshall plan, which I've warned
[22:54.400 --> 22:58.280]  you would be when they make their main move, we have Prince Charles saying this is a military
[22:58.280 --> 23:03.720]  action, we're going to spend more money than exists in the whole world to end carbon as
[23:03.720 --> 23:06.800]  we know it, we're a carbon-based life form, in fact I forgot to tell you guys to get that
[23:06.800 --> 23:13.960]  again from six months ago or five months ago, Prince Charles says that we need to make it
[23:13.960 --> 23:19.680]  a global military campaign to decarbonize when life is carbon-baseless planet, he's
[23:19.680 --> 23:24.480]  made new announcements, we've got all those, it's just insane, we're now living in what
[23:24.480 --> 23:29.840]  we warned about for so long, but I had to run a rebroadcast and play some important old
[23:29.840 --> 23:35.320]  reports and things and some new reports because I don't choke when it comes to stress or being
[23:35.320 --> 23:41.720]  under attack, but right before the show about 20 minutes before, a bunch of big developments
[23:41.720 --> 23:49.240]  happened, all of them good, that I just can't even get out of my mind right now, but I cannot
[23:49.240 --> 23:57.400]  release the information at this point, and so we have a very special guest, federal court
[23:57.400 --> 24:00.880]  just ruled that they could not shut down his church and that it was unconstitutional during
[24:00.880 --> 24:04.200]  the lockdowns, that pastor is going to be joining us in the second hour and I will be
[24:04.200 --> 24:08.280]  here for that, that is a big deal, of course we knew that had to happen, if we still have
[24:08.280 --> 24:13.200]  any semblance of freedom, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.280]  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, then it goes on to the right of the press,
[24:17.280 --> 24:22.960]  the right to assemble and redress the grievances, LA pandemic restrictions, Louisiana pandemic
[24:22.960 --> 24:27.960]  restrictions, violated religious rights, court rules, pastor Tony Spell takes victory lap,
[24:27.960 --> 24:33.040]  that's NBC News, but it's not gotten a lot of attention, that's local news, he's joining
[24:33.040 --> 24:41.920]  us, we've got so much more to hit, and I'm really prepared here today too, but we may
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.200]  just have to call Owen and get him in here, because I don't know if I can do the show,
[24:45.200 --> 24:52.480]  so the stuff going on is that big, and I need to process this, and I need to, man I tell
[24:52.480 --> 25:02.880]  you, I'm not going to get to it yet, I can't half-ass this, and I've got to go sit in my
[25:02.880 --> 25:14.880]  office for 10-15 minutes and cogitate on this, because I just, man, there's a lot of good
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.240]  news and a lot of really bad news as well, and I was already going to come in here and
[25:19.240 --> 25:27.480]  cover the bad news so we can get a position to deal with it, and be in a fighting stance,
[25:27.480 --> 25:33.000]  and then this other information came in, and it's just unbelievable, but it's on, the
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.440]  fight between good and evil is here, and a lot of people in the power structure have
[25:37.440 --> 25:41.480]  decided to not join with the New World Order, now that they see just how damn evil it is,
[25:41.480 --> 25:45.280]  because we're now down to the point of literally cutting off the food, the water, not just
[25:45.280 --> 25:49.840]  the baby formula, the electricity, that's how they're going to win their fight against,
[25:49.840 --> 25:55.480]  this is shut everything down, and what I'm saying is life and death, so please just take
[25:55.480 --> 26:01.840]  a moment, imagine you can hear a pin drop, because I want what I'm about to say to really
[26:01.840 --> 26:09.000]  get home, okay?
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.800]  If the globalist think they can get away with their operation, they're going to do it, and
[26:14.800 --> 26:18.640]  they've already done a stress test in the last two years with the COVID lockdowns as
[26:18.640 --> 26:25.800]  a beta test for the next big move, planetary collapse, mass riots, mass migration, war
[26:25.800 --> 26:34.760]  in the streets, total crime, UN takeover of what's left, it is all in progress now, and
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.640]  by the time the general public figures it out, it'll be too late to reverse it, we'll
[26:40.640 --> 26:47.320]  win long term, there's a lot of scenarios I've crawled through psychologically, mentally,
[26:47.320 --> 26:55.200]  spiritually, we will prevail, but the globalists were put in power by Satan to carry this out
[26:55.200 --> 27:03.880]  and they're slaves, and they will execute this attempt, and so that's where we are
[27:03.880 --> 27:10.600]  right now, and to say I'm speechless is basically what we're at, I need a compartmental
[27:10.600 --> 27:14.760]  lies the information, I'm not ready to release yet, and I normally can do that, I'm trying
[27:14.760 --> 27:18.960]  to right now, but it's the front of my mind, and then I need to just judiciously cover
[27:18.960 --> 27:27.040]  this news, and I'm going to do the show, but I've got to really go sit down for at least
[27:27.040 --> 27:38.280]  two minutes and mollusk by myself, and just really get some focus here, man, it's unbelievable,
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.720]  it's so unbelievable now, and I just can't believe so many people don't know what they've
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.640]  signed on to, I mean God help us, and I mean that, God please help us, I think we all just
[27:47.640 --> 27:52.840]  need to pray for justice and pray for an awakening and pray to come together and have love, and
[27:52.840 --> 27:58.280]  none of us are perfect, but God can perfect us, and through God we are perfected, and
[27:58.280 --> 28:01.840]  I just pray that God send the Holy Spirit to me and everybody else to be stronger than
[28:01.840 --> 28:08.200]  ever so that we can try to avert this, because I have an extreme feeling of responsibility
[28:08.200 --> 28:16.680]  knowing all this, try to stop it, I know you do as well, and I mean there'll be a billion
[28:16.680 --> 28:21.800]  dead people in two years under this plan, conservatively, if you imagine what that's
[28:21.800 --> 28:28.160]  going to look like, what that's going to entail, and of course this is all real, you see it
[28:28.160 --> 28:36.960]  now it's all happening, but I mean it really needs to sink in, that they are running an
[28:36.960 --> 28:43.080]  operation to kill us, and that they enjoy it, and they like it, and we've got to stop
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.560]  them, I mean we're not going to let them kill everybody, we've got to do it, alright get
[28:48.560 --> 28:52.360]  right with God folks, I'm going to try to get focused and just come back and cover the
[28:52.360 --> 29:15.840]  news, we'll see if I can do it, stay with us.
[29:15.840 --> 29:20.960]  It's so hard to source good clean herbs like we have in this that it's been sold out for

[33:35.960 --> 33:41.520]  war against the nation to bring us to our knees financially.
[33:41.520 --> 33:48.240]  We have to stop them, we have to demand the Republicans move for impeachment immediately
[33:48.240 --> 33:51.680]  even though they don't have all the votes, it will expose the Democratic Party and what
[33:51.680 --> 33:55.760]  they're doing and who they are controlled by and it will expose Republicans that are
[33:55.760 --> 33:58.040]  in league with them, it must be done.
[33:58.040 --> 34:03.480]  That's just one of the default settings if you're in a factory and something blows up
[34:03.480 --> 34:08.560]  and a guy's on fire, you grab a fire extinguisher and put them out.
[34:08.560 --> 34:10.960]  That's just the fire extinguisher.
[34:10.960 --> 34:14.000]  We've got to continue to educate people as fast as we can.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.080]  We are really entering an incredibly explosive moment where the globalist propaganda has
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.240]  totally failed, everybody's turning against them, but they still have the centralized
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.200]  power and are accelerating their program and it is just super dangerous.
[34:28.200 --> 34:33.360]  And I've got the stacks right here, it's on inforwars.com, zero hedge article.
[34:33.360 --> 34:37.520]  By demonstration anticipating wave of summer violence over Roe v. Wade, they're the ones
[34:37.520 --> 34:38.680]  that are going to be violent.
[34:38.680 --> 34:43.200]  I told you going into the midterms, they were going to pull this and it's like clockwork
[34:43.200 --> 34:44.200]  happening.
[34:44.200 --> 34:48.640]  So we've got that and then we've got reports like this, I mean it's just all of these are
[34:48.640 --> 34:49.880]  so insane.
[34:49.880 --> 34:54.760]  Gas stations, this is Daily Mail, in Washington reprogrammed pumps, this is on record, to
[34:54.760 --> 34:59.920]  prepare for, wait for it, gas stations in Washington reprogrammed pumps to prepare for
[34:59.920 --> 35:08.480]  $10 a gallon fuel as Biden flays since average price soaring $4.57 almost twice the 241 during
[35:08.480 --> 35:12.240]  Trump's final month.
[35:12.240 --> 35:15.600]  And again, what's the lie in that headline?
[35:15.600 --> 35:19.640]  As much as it's fun to make fun of Biden, the joke's on us, he's a placeholder for the
[35:19.640 --> 35:26.520]  globalist and Obama so that he gets the blame when this all goes down because if they get
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.840]  the blame, they will have to stop their lockdowns, which they've done for now, they'll have to
[35:30.840 --> 35:37.440]  stop all this inflation, it's all artificial economic warfare.
[35:37.440 --> 35:41.040]  So it's not like I'm here just saying, oh you need to get angry and call Congress and
[35:41.040 --> 35:46.080]  call talk radio, you better do it or they will bankrupt you to control you.
[35:46.080 --> 35:51.000]  And the next phases of this thing are way worse than it is now and that's why I'm so
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.280]  desperate to try to mitigate this before it gets too bad.
[35:56.280 --> 36:02.120]  Mark my words, everybody serving the system that thinks they're on the winning team are
[36:02.120 --> 36:03.120]  fools.
[36:03.120 --> 36:10.600]  This is going to destroy the globalist in the process of destroying us.
[36:10.600 --> 36:15.320]  I've got a stack of news all over the world where the Pfizer, Moderna and J&J shots were
[36:15.320 --> 36:21.200]  given with children's livers liquefying, many of them dying, and it's specifically known
[36:21.200 --> 36:25.200]  that the J&J is the one that does it the worst, but they all create the same spike protein
[36:25.200 --> 36:28.440]  and I've had medical doctors on to lay that out.
[36:28.440 --> 36:32.000]  These people are so damn sick.
[36:32.000 --> 36:38.240]  Record miscarriages, record babies being born stillborn, they're not just aborting our children
[36:38.240 --> 36:41.360]  before they're born, they're aborting all of us.
[36:41.360 --> 36:44.960]  That's what the New World Order is and I've got a bunch of these clips.
[36:44.960 --> 36:51.360]  Here is a Congress yesterday in a by-demonstration abortion testimony with a by-demonstration
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.040]  official and they say, what is a man?
[36:56.040 --> 36:57.040]  Can a man have a baby?
[36:57.040 --> 36:59.440]  And they go, yeah, a man can have a baby.
[36:59.440 --> 37:01.880]  This is the people that say they're all about science.
[37:01.880 --> 37:05.640]  Bill Nye, the science guy a few years ago, went back and re-edited his 1980s and 90s
[37:05.640 --> 37:10.880]  TV shows where they had shows about X and Y chromosomes in male and female and they
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.120]  went and took that out and said, oh no, everybody's male and female.
[37:15.120 --> 37:22.160]  And there's new big studies out where many frog populations have completely died and
[37:22.160 --> 37:29.000]  become extinct because of atrazine alone making the frogs all, quote, feminine.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.480]  It's just the end game.
[37:32.480 --> 37:39.400]  We are entering the end game, their blueprint for global enslavement and extermination.
[37:39.400 --> 37:43.560]  And it's just, it's incredible.
[37:43.560 --> 37:50.560]  I mean, it's moving faster and faster and faster and faster and you see the delusional
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.360]  people that either don't want to know what's going on or are part of it pretending like
[37:54.360 --> 38:03.000]  they're going to win and they're all going to be consumed in the flames of tyranny.
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.800]  If I thought violence would help, we've certainly passed the point of the Declaration of Independence,
[38:08.800 --> 38:13.120]  our right, our duty to throw off the bonds of tyranny to remake a new government.
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.280]  But the way they've set up the brainwashing and the control, any violence even against
[38:17.280 --> 38:21.280]  globalists themselves will just give them more power and control because it's an evil
[38:21.280 --> 38:24.440]  system that's thousands of deep.
[38:24.440 --> 38:27.360]  It's like a football coach saying, you got to take out that wide receiver, he just scored
[38:27.360 --> 38:28.360]  two touchdowns.
[38:28.360 --> 38:33.760]  I don't care if you get thrown out of the game, I want you to spear him in the kidneys.
[38:33.760 --> 38:38.440]  What if they had a thousand more wide receivers just as good as that guy or better?
[38:38.440 --> 38:47.520]  Well, then you can't send in your linebacker to break their ribs.
[38:47.520 --> 38:49.600]  This is not traditional war.
[38:49.600 --> 38:52.880]  So violence isn't just not the answer.
[38:52.880 --> 38:55.960]  Violence is absolutely what we don't want.
[38:55.960 --> 38:59.160]  I've been criticized by some for saying there shouldn't have been violence at the Capitol
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.880]  that day, sure it's overblown, most people are totally innocent, others are in solitary
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.280]  confinement, should have already been out of jail, Kamala Harris is bailing out people
[39:06.280 --> 39:11.840]  that burned down federal buildings and fire bomb things.
[39:11.840 --> 39:15.680]  But I get criticized by callers saying, hey, you should have helped storm it that day,
[39:15.680 --> 39:16.960]  we could have taken the government.
[39:16.960 --> 39:23.480]  That capitol is not the government, the military government is in Cheyenne Mountain and Colorado
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.920]  Springs and site R, and that's not even the government.
[39:28.920 --> 39:32.000]  The government is the global corporations.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.120]  And so it's not a cowardice issue that I don't want violence, blowing up a federal building
[39:38.120 --> 39:42.720]  does nothing but turn the instrument of the globalist into a victim, the last thing we
[39:42.720 --> 39:44.720]  want.
[39:44.720 --> 39:49.600]  So I tell you now, there will come points if we don't stop this when they're coming to
[39:49.600 --> 39:56.440]  take you to FEMA camps under the guise of viruses, and you will know that at that point
[39:56.440 --> 40:01.240]  it's a decision you've got to make between you and God and your family.
[40:01.240 --> 40:06.720]  But before we get to that point, you need to make the decision that you're going to
[40:06.720 --> 40:14.680]  speak out and stand up and engage in civil disobedience in a legal and lawful way, depending
[40:14.680 --> 40:25.200]  on if God has a report they put out in the 60s, I think it's titled 198 or 199 ways to
[40:25.200 --> 40:31.000]  peacefully resist civil disobedience, and I've read the report on there before.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.640]  And it's a report you should really go read because you'll see we've put most of that
[40:35.640 --> 40:39.680]  into action here, but we can't do all of it, you're going to have to put it into action.
[40:39.680 --> 40:45.000]  And you're going to have to decide whether you want to be a soldier of truth and justice
[40:45.000 --> 40:52.120]  to peacefully resist this or whether you want to try to go hide and wait it out, or as if
[40:52.120 --> 40:55.920]  you could write it out, or whether or not you want to take the right course, and that
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.200]  is total political action, prayer and civil action.
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.040]  There it is, 198 methods of nonviolent action.
[41:04.040 --> 41:05.040]  Now go read it.
[41:05.040 --> 41:11.240]  I'm going to post it in full under the live show feed today, Ben, our great writer and
[41:11.240 --> 41:17.880]  researcher in there, post the whole thing, not just a link, but you can post the text
[41:17.880 --> 41:21.160]  under the live show feed today, and we can put the live show feed on air so I can give
[41:21.160 --> 41:26.800]  folks the headline of the day so that everybody can share it, emergency broadcast.
[41:26.800 --> 41:35.120]  The UN Davos Group have openly announced a planetary democracy-based dictatorship as
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.600]  U.S. is engulfed by record inflation, collapsing border, and a proxy war with Russia.
[41:41.600 --> 41:46.040]  And the globalists do intend to have this go from a proxy war to a full war with Russia
[41:46.040 --> 41:49.720]  as their great reset, their build back better, you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing,
[41:49.720 --> 41:50.720]  you'll like it.
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.440]  Now I got a bunch of abortion clips that we'll get to when we come back, then we have a special
[41:55.440 --> 41:59.000]  guest on the First Amendment, this pastor and this big federal win, and then in the
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.400]  third hour, I'm going to cover the UN treaty and the world finally waking up to it, and
[42:03.400 --> 42:07.200]  now they're leaking what's in it, they're writing it in secret, and they're making public
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.680]  announcements that the Davos Group is in command of the UN, so the corporate technocrats are
[42:11.680 --> 42:13.960]  now in full command of this takeover.
[42:13.960 --> 42:21.440]  That is all coming up as well today, and I beg you, for the sake of your children, your
[42:21.440 --> 42:28.880]  grandchildren, your neighbors, your friends, and your own life, to realize this audience
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.960]  is the tip of the spear, and you have initiated the chain of action already, we've got a fighting
[42:33.960 --> 42:38.520]  chance, but sharing info wars dot com forward slash show, or telling everybody you know
[42:38.520 --> 42:43.920]  about that local radio station, or TV station, or cable station, that picks us up, is so
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.160]  critical, sharing the articles and videos from Band-Aught Video is so critical and buying
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.120]  products, info wars dot com, and we've had a lot of big support, and a lot of big donations

[43:59.400 --> 44:05.720]  So I did it, I signed up for the Austin Marathon, I've been training, probably not as much as
[44:05.720 --> 44:09.920]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[44:09.920 --> 44:16.160]  Before I start out on a run, I throw down some Turboforce to give me that energy I need
[44:16.160 --> 44:22.000]  to get going, besides the energy Turboforce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.840]  C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.480]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training, and then every day now,
[44:31.480 --> 44:37.640]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis, I have bad joints, thanks mom, so this is great for giving
[44:37.640 --> 44:43.440]  my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[44:43.440 --> 44:48.000]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast, so I can get back to the training.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.680]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turboforce, that can
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.800]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Sorilis can keep you
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.000]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.560]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, Vaso Beats will

[47:00.720 --> 47:27.560]  Creating a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:27.560 --> 47:33.640]  I believe that everyone can identify for themselves.
[47:33.640 --> 47:37.760]  Do you believe then that men can become pregnant and have abortions?
[47:37.760 --> 47:38.760]  Yes.
[47:38.760 --> 47:52.240]  Well, that's the Biden administration official over abortion.
[47:52.240 --> 47:59.080]  Let's play this clip of the New York mayor doubles down on abortion up to the time children
[47:59.080 --> 48:00.080]  are born.
[48:00.080 --> 48:02.600]  A woman should determine what they're going to do with their bodies.
[48:02.600 --> 48:05.360]  And so a baby coming out of the womb nine months old is her body.
[48:05.360 --> 48:06.360]  Kill it.
[48:06.360 --> 48:09.880]  Overwhelming number of people on the Supreme Court, I don't believe they can deliver a
[48:09.880 --> 48:10.880]  baby.
[48:10.880 --> 48:12.240]  Oh, that's right.
[48:12.240 --> 48:13.240]  It's the medical system.
[48:13.240 --> 48:15.680]  It's their decision what to do.
[48:15.680 --> 48:18.600]  Now they have got bills introduced all over the country to kill babies after they're born
[48:18.600 --> 48:20.800]  for weeks after.
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.040]  Here are these monsters made in this country.
[48:24.040 --> 48:28.000]  You've been an ardent supporter of abortion rights and I want to play an exchange where
[48:28.000 --> 48:29.000]  you talked about this.
[48:29.000 --> 48:30.000]  Let's listen.
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  There, Adam.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  Do you think there should be any limitation on abortion?
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  No, I do not.
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  None?
[48:37.000 --> 48:38.520]  They have birth totally fine?
[48:38.520 --> 48:43.280]  No, I do not think I think women should have a right to choose their bodies.
[48:43.280 --> 48:47.000]  Men should not have that right to choose how women should treat their bodies.
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.120]  What is interesting, a poll that just came out this morning, NPR Marist says the vast
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.840]  majority of Americans do not support overturning Roe versus Wade, but a majority, including
[48:55.840 --> 49:00.640]  a majority of Democrats, does believe that there could or should be some restrictions
[49:00.640 --> 49:03.040]  in when during a pregnancy.
[49:03.040 --> 49:04.040]  That could be.
[49:04.040 --> 49:06.120]  You say no restrictions at all.
[49:06.120 --> 49:11.840]  No, I say and I continue to say and I stand by this, women should determine what they're
[49:11.840 --> 49:14.000]  going to do with their bodies.
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.280]  I just believe it's unbelievable that men are making these determinations.
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.880]  Women should determine the overwhelming number of people on the Supreme Court.
[49:23.880 --> 49:26.440]  I don't believe they can deliver a baby.
[49:26.440 --> 49:29.840]  So women should be determined what they're going to do with their bodies.
[49:29.840 --> 49:33.680]  I strongly believe that and I'm not taking a Gallup poll to make that determination.
[49:33.680 --> 49:40.040]  It is something I believe from seeing the women who are in my life, my mother that
[49:40.040 --> 49:44.920]  passed away, my two sisters and others, they should make the determination of what they
[49:44.920 --> 49:47.160]  want to do with their bodies.
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.240]  Mayor Eric Adams, I do appreciate your time this morning.
[49:49.240 --> 49:50.560]  Thanks so much for being with us.
[49:50.560 --> 49:54.440]  They're talking about babies that are already born, ladies and gentlemen, and they do it
[49:54.440 --> 49:58.960]  with a straight face and then say it's unbelievable that we don't want to kill them.
[49:58.960 --> 50:01.800]  And they say, well, nobody wants these babies, but you know, statistically, there are more
[50:01.800 --> 50:05.560]  people wanting to adopt each year than there are even abortions.
[50:05.560 --> 50:08.960]  Here's Congressman Chip Roy grilling some of these people in yesterday's hearings and
[50:08.960 --> 50:10.560]  they were just floundering everywhere.
[50:10.560 --> 50:14.720]  They can't answer any questions because they're at war with science, with logic, and with
[50:14.720 --> 50:15.920]  God.
[50:15.920 --> 50:20.000]  In light of that, and in the light of Texas being in an inhospitable place, according
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  to your testimony, are you aware of how many people have moved to the state of Texas in
[50:24.000 --> 50:25.000]  the last decade?
[50:25.000 --> 50:28.440]  Do you know what that number is?
[50:28.440 --> 50:29.440]  I don't know.
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.440]  Yeah.
[50:30.440 --> 50:33.600]  I will say that the clinics that you're referring to are fakes and they don't actually...
[50:33.600 --> 50:37.000]  Four million people have moved to the state of Texas in the last decade.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.560]  That's the population of the entire state of Alabama have moved to the state of Texas
[50:41.560 --> 50:44.000]  by choice in the last decade.
[50:44.000 --> 50:45.000]  I would tell...
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.840]  I would move to one other question here.
[50:47.840 --> 50:48.840]  Ms. Robinson...
[50:48.840 --> 50:52.200]  Could I finish my answer though about Texas?
[50:52.200 --> 50:53.440]  I didn't ask you a question about that.
[50:53.440 --> 50:56.240]  Ms. Robinson, I would ask you a question.
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.240]  When is the latest that you have performed an abortion in terms of weeks of the unborn
[51:01.240 --> 51:03.240]  child?
[51:03.240 --> 51:12.240]  Yes, my name is Dr. Robinson, and I provide abortion care in Alabama, so Alabama has...
[51:12.240 --> 51:13.240]  What is the answer to the question?
[51:13.240 --> 51:15.200]  The latest that you have performed an abortion.
[51:15.200 --> 51:17.280]  I'm going to answer your question.
[51:17.280 --> 51:22.400]  So unfortunately, my state is one of those states that has passed restrictions or bans
[51:22.400 --> 51:26.000]  on abortion care, which limits physicians like myself from...
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.360]  And therefore, in other words, you would like to do it later.
[51:28.360 --> 51:30.760]  What is the latest you have performed an abortion?
[51:30.760 --> 51:35.040]  So since I will always follow the law, and I live in the state of Alabama, I provide
[51:35.040 --> 51:37.480]  abortion care up until 20 weeks gestational age.
[51:37.480 --> 51:39.600]  Okay, so you performed an abortion at 20 weeks?
[51:39.600 --> 51:40.600]  Yes, sir.
[51:40.600 --> 51:44.640]  The procedure for an abortion, when we're talking about it at 20 weeks, as I understand
[51:44.640 --> 51:49.920]  it, is dilation and extraction.
[51:49.920 --> 51:53.000]  That's a baby.
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.600]  Now let's shift gears into how these people that have served Satan and that are going
[51:57.600 --> 52:06.240]  against common sense of God's law and just natural law, fall over themselves.
[52:06.240 --> 52:12.120]  Take George W. Bush, who launched illegal wars all around the world, whose sanctions
[52:12.120 --> 52:18.800]  killed millions of people, who lied about WMDs, who helped open our borders, who helped sign
[52:18.800 --> 52:24.880]  us onto the New World Order, and he has a Freudian slip and talks about the horrible
[52:24.880 --> 52:34.120]  evil murderers that, not blaming the troops, but that commanded that lie and that fraud
[52:34.120 --> 52:39.400]  of the Second Iraq War, 2003, that cost us over $5 trillion, and it went on for over
[52:39.400 --> 52:46.360]  a decade, and it killed so many of our great troops and others, and wounded so many.
[52:46.360 --> 52:54.560]  And here he is, talking about himself out of the mouths of babes.
[52:54.560 --> 52:59.800]  Here's a guy, admittedly on a bunch of psychotropic drugs, talking about himself while he tries
[52:59.800 --> 53:04.080]  to talk about Vladimir Putin, when even the Pope admits the West went and overthrew the
[53:04.080 --> 53:09.240]  elected government eight years ago in Ukraine, started the war, attacked the Russian borders,
[53:09.240 --> 53:12.880]  to get them to invade, they wanted that, they admit that.
[53:12.880 --> 53:16.560]  Does that mean, pootie-poot, as Bush called him, is perfect?
[53:16.560 --> 53:23.320]  No, but the person that starts the fight, under common law, under natural law, is the
[53:23.320 --> 53:28.480]  person that gets the main blame.
[53:28.480 --> 53:29.480]  Am I glad Putin invaded?
[53:29.480 --> 53:34.560]  No, I said it was a mistake and it was a trap, and Putin's finding that out right now.
[53:34.560 --> 53:41.880]  But regardless, they're the ones under attack, not us, from the Russians, but we're under
[53:41.880 --> 53:46.600]  attack by the very same Soros criminal combine, setting up a world government right now to
[53:46.600 --> 53:51.680]  take over all your medical freedom, and run the CDC, and cut off your fossil fuels.
[53:51.680 --> 53:56.360]  They've announced the plan, they're accelerating it, they're not going to get rid of fossil
[53:56.360 --> 54:03.320]  fuels by 2040, now it's 2030, and I've got all that coming up third hour, three stacks,
[54:03.320 --> 54:12.760]  full of videos, Prince Charles, all of them saying it, Bill Gates, Tedros, all of them.
[54:12.760 --> 54:16.080]  The economy is energy.
[54:16.080 --> 54:19.840]  You cut it off, society collapses.
[54:19.840 --> 54:23.680]  With our sprawling cities, we're not even designed to be able to operate without it.
[54:23.680 --> 54:28.280]  We were rural farms and spread out across the country, we don't need their fossil fuel,
[54:28.280 --> 54:31.440]  but they're holding us hostage and they know it.
[54:31.440 --> 54:37.920]  Here's George W. Bush, the war criminal, Henry Kissinger's footstool, inadvertently
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.640]  talking about himself while he tries to attack Russia.
[54:41.640 --> 54:50.120]  In contrast, Russian elections are rigged, political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise
[54:50.120 --> 54:55.040]  eliminated from participating in the electoral process.
[54:55.040 --> 55:03.280]  The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to
[55:03.280 --> 55:13.040]  launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq, I mean of Ukraine, Iraq too, anyway.
[55:13.040 --> 55:14.040]  75.
[55:14.040 --> 55:23.640]  Yeah, let me find, I'm really good at killing people with drones, no I'm serious, I'll kill
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.960]  you, so Obama, oh he's black, he can kill everyone, so it's so liberal.
[55:28.960 --> 55:31.320]  Let's hear that one more time.
[55:31.320 --> 55:34.280]  Beyond the Freudian slip, here it is.
[55:34.280 --> 55:42.520]  The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to
[55:42.520 --> 55:51.800]  launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq, I mean of Ukraine, Iraq too, anyway.
[55:51.800 --> 56:04.600]  75, uh, here's the, all right, ladies and gentlemen, let me just do this as we get right
[56:04.600 --> 56:07.040]  in the hour and bring a special guest on with a big victory.
[56:07.040 --> 56:09.800]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[56:09.800 --> 56:15.400]  I have a stack of mainline science reports and studies that the JMJ shop particularly
[56:15.400 --> 56:19.160]  is liquefying people's livers, including children.
[56:19.160 --> 56:22.940]  We have the giant stack on Biden handing over us sovereignty to the world health organization
[56:22.940 --> 56:25.800]  and draft copies of the treaty leaking.
[56:25.800 --> 56:29.240]  They're already telling you what's in it.
[56:29.240 --> 56:34.600]  We have another NATO leader voices opposition to Sweden and Finland and Russia moves withdraw
[56:34.600 --> 56:38.680]  from the WTO, WHO.
[56:38.680 --> 56:46.840]  We have unbelievable developments with the currencies of the world and inflation.
[56:46.840 --> 56:51.880]  We have the sexual harassment and brainwashing of five, six, seven year old children in a
[56:51.880 --> 56:54.080]  transgenderism where they're expelled.
[56:54.080 --> 57:00.200]  If they don't learn all the pronouns, it's all coming up next hour, but I'm not going
[57:00.200 --> 57:04.440]  to sit here and even ask you to go to infowarstore.com and buy great products that you already need.
[57:04.440 --> 57:05.440]  I appreciate your support.
[57:05.440 --> 57:06.920]  We've been getting a lot of support.
[57:06.920 --> 57:07.920]  Thank you.
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.000]  These are great products you already need, but I am going to ask you to pray for this
[57:12.000 --> 57:17.440]  broadcast and I am going to ask you to tell everybody you know as we go to break on your
[57:17.440 --> 57:18.440]  email list.

[59:44.160 --> 59:51.800]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[59:51.800 --> 1:00:00.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:04.800]  First health crisis we're facing in more than a century, don't tell your supporters don't
[1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:07.280]  be afraid of COVID.
[1:00:07.280 --> 1:00:19.560]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:23.280]  Don't tell your supporters don't be afraid of COVID.
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:27.720]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:31.600]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.680]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[1:00:34.680 --> 1:00:38.800]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready and if you're in the
[1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:42.520]  hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that you get them and
[1:00:42.520 --> 1:00:59.320]  you're going to get them free and especially if you're a CEO, we're going to get you.
[1:00:59.320 --> 1:01:01.480]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:01:01.480 --> 1:01:03.680]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:11.080]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:18.080]  Because there are no one who can tell them don't do this.
[1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:23.360]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak, just let me say, even now, orders
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:27.600]  are being shouted into telephones and men with guns supposed to be on their way.
[1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:28.600]  It's Chancellor Sutton.
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:29.600]  Damn it.
[1:01:29.600 --> 1:01:30.600]  Why?
[1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:35.560]  Because while the transmission may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:37.560]  retain their power.
[1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:44.560]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the annunciations of
[1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:45.560]  the truth.
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:48.120]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:49.120]  You designed it, sir.
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:50.120]  You wanted it foolproof.
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.640]  You taught me every television in longer cruelty and intolerance and depression.
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:00.040]  And where once you have the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now
[1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:05.480]  have sensors and systems of surveillance perversing your conformity and suggesting your submachine
[1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:06.480]  cameras.
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:08.080]  What did this happen?
[1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.080]  Who's to blame?
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:12.680]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[1:02:12.680 --> 1:02:14.680]  They will be held accountable.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:21.200]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:23.200]  I know why you did it.
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:24.200]  I know you were afraid.
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:25.200]  Who would it be?
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:26.200]  War, terror, disease?
[1:02:26.200 --> 1:02:33.680]  There were a myriad of problems to conspire to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:34.680]  common sense.
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:40.080]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:41.080]  Sutler.
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:46.360]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent
[1:02:46.360 --> 1:03:12.480]  obedient consent.
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:33.680]  I'm watching the midterms, then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:41.400]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala, they're coming from Mexico.
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:04:01.080]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:23.200]  And you would think everybody in the country is like, to the bunker.
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:59.600]  I'm watching the midterms, they're coming from Guatemala.
[1:06:02.080 --> 1:06:08.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:09.680]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:17.080]  Well, so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:22.600]  Well, he was on with us several times, a year and a half ago, during the thick of the lockdowns
[1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:32.120]  that Fauci now says doesn't exist, Pastor Tony Spell arrested, demonized, fined, attacked,
[1:06:32.120 --> 1:06:36.440]  church shut down for refusing to close, while they let all the big box stores continue to
[1:06:36.440 --> 1:06:43.920]  operate, Congress has no authority over religion and the First Amendment, and now major ruling
[1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:47.880]  says that it was unconstitutional what happened to this man.
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:53.640]  The days of criminal trouble are all over for central pastor Tony Spell, today the state
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:57.840]  Supreme Court dismissed all charges against him and said the governor's COVID restrictions
[1:06:57.840 --> 1:07:00.800]  on worship actually violated his rights.
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:04.240]  While there's still a civil case pending, the pastor and his attorney told us today's
[1:07:04.240 --> 1:07:09.320]  ruling could shape future emergency orders from the government.
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.920]  I'm glad we listened to God and not the governor.
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:16.760]  Pastor Tony Spell says he's already planning a triumphant Sunday sermon following a state
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:22.520]  Supreme Court decision that declared state COVID restrictions violated his First Amendment
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:23.520]  rights.
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:31.920]  We've been mocked, we've been ridiculed, we've been slandered, defamed, but now we're thankful
[1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:36.320]  that we have finally been vindicated by the highest court in the state of Louisiana.
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:41.400]  Spell was arrested in April of 2020, accused of violating executive orders from Governor
[1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:46.640]  John Bell Edwards that laid out restrictions on businesses and in-person gatherings during
[1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:48.520]  the peak of the pandemic.
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:53.840]  Despite those orders, Spell continued to hold massive in-person services at Life Tabernacle
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.600]  Church in central.
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:01.480]  In a 19-page ruling, state justice William J. Crane overturned lower court rulings, saying
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  the governor's COVID restrictions violated First Amendment rights.
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:10.680]  Specifically, the justice argues the state could not prove that large church gatherings
[1:08:10.680 --> 1:08:16.200]  posed a greater risk of exposure to the virus than shopping at a secular business or attending
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.440]  work as an essential employee.
[1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:21.000]  The ruling can be summed up in this line.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:25.920]  We interpret Pastor Spell's request not as one for special treatment, but for equal
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:26.920]  treatment.
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:28.880]  You know, there's a lot of politics against us.
[1:08:28.880 --> 1:08:32.920]  Spell's attorney, Jeff Wittenbrink, believes the ruling will set a new precedent for future
[1:08:32.920 --> 1:08:34.400]  emergency orders.
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:39.440]  The implications long term are that from now on, when there's an emergency, the justice
[1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:43.480]  has made it clear that government has to pay attention to those rights that we have that
[1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:46.680]  are protected by the Constitution.
[1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:50.920]  The governor's office also responded to the ruling, saying while they disagree, they accept
[1:08:50.920 --> 1:08:51.920]  it.
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:55.440]  He said in part, each and every action Governor Edwards took throughout the COVID pandemic
[1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:58.640]  was done with the goal of protecting their congregations.
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:06.560]  You can read his full statement and the ruling in full.
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:10.000]  It's the First Amendment, not the Second, not the Fifth, not the Tenth, not the Twentieth.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.640]  It's the First.
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:16.200]  There shall make no law respecting and establishing religion or prohibiting the free exercise
[1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:21.720]  thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people to
[1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:27.680]  peaceably assemble and to petition the government for redress agreements.
[1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:32.760]  But it's not just equal treatment that local governments and the national government should
[1:09:32.760 --> 1:09:33.760]  give.
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.360]  The country was founded over religious freedom and there is no jurisdiction over the church
[1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:41.800]  because we do not have a state religion.
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:45.960]  We are not Iran.
[1:09:45.960 --> 1:09:50.080]  We are the United States of America and people came here for their religious freedom.
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:57.560]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the
[1:09:57.560 --> 1:10:00.760]  free exercise thereof.
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:12.280]  Our entire Bill of Rights starts with those words, Congress shall make no, no, no, no,
[1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:23.160]  no law respecting the establishment or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.120]  And Pastor Spell got demonized on national news.
[1:10:26.120 --> 1:10:27.640]  He got attacked as a criminal.
[1:10:27.640 --> 1:10:31.960]  He was a horrible person while the Walmarts and the Targets and the topless bars were
[1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:36.280]  open that the left worldwide, not just here, said churches need to stay shut.
[1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:41.280]  There are still pastors in Canada in jail.
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:44.520]  Many of them help without bond for what's happening here.
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:49.000]  So what Tony Spell has done with his strength and his honor and his very successful powerful
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:50.640]  church is amazing.
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:56.360]  LTCBR.com, Tony Spell on YouTube, I'm not going to go over his whole background but
[1:10:56.360 --> 1:11:00.640]  he is a faithful visionary of life, Tabernacle Church, a multicultural and multi-generational
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:03.320]  church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:11.960]  He and his beautiful wife since 2009, he is known as the Pentecostal apostle faith because
[1:11:11.960 --> 1:11:17.600]  of his unwavering faith in Almighty God, his powerful preaching and his intense laboring
[1:11:17.600 --> 1:11:19.720]  in the gospel.
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:21.440]  And he joins us now.
[1:11:21.440 --> 1:11:25.760]  Thank God for the First Amendment, but thank God for him making him force the issue when
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:28.000]  so many others buckled and back down.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:34.240]  I go to a lot of different churches in Austin, some non-denominational, some others, I have
[1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:36.360]  a lot of friends, we go to different churches every week.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:40.000]  The point is, is that most of them were shut down even though they're good people.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.160]  They follow those orders.
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:43.920]  You didn't follow those orders, sir.
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:45.440]  This is a big, big deal.
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:48.200]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[1:11:48.200 --> 1:11:49.200]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.280]  It's good to be with you again.
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:57.400]  Throughout the ages, men have suffered death rather than to subordinate their allegiance
[1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:02.120]  to Almighty God over to the authority of the state.
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:08.640]  Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, William Evan Hughes in 1931.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:12.840]  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and are endowed
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:18.160]  by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.
[1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:22.320]  Self-evidential means the government did not give us the right to practice our religion
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:28.640]  and peaceably assemble, therefore, they cannot take from us our rights to practice our religion
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:30.120]  and freely assemble.
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:38.720]  Now, of course, in March the 17th, 2020, our tyrant of a governor, King John Bell Edwards,
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:45.160]  thought that he could close down the churches and he learned differently because not only
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:52.920]  did he not close our church, but because of his afflicting us, we multiplied and grew
[1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:57.960]  over 2,500 people since that day have been water baptized in our church.
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:03.560]  People have been healed of incurable diseases and people in our congregation found hope
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:10.040]  and help and life in a time of death, in a time of religious persecution.
[1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:18.040]  Now, NBC News there, in your lead up to this story, said that spells sought equal but not
[1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:19.960]  greater than protection.
[1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:28.280]  If that's all they pulled out of this 29-page verdict by the Louisiana Supreme Court, which
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:34.360]  these Supreme Court justices, five out of seven, said, everything that the governor
[1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:40.000]  did to us for the past 27 months was illegal and unconstitutional.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.640]  We did not ask for equal protection.
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:48.480]  What we said, Alex, is that Congress should make no law, meaning if the Congress cannot
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:54.600]  do it, what give the executive branch the idea that they could?
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:14:00.480]  And what you can take away from this five to two ruling, which was the greatest win
[1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:06.760]  for religious freedom in American history over 245 years, and it's the greatest win
[1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:12.400]  because there's never been a time in our nation's history where the churches were demanded
[1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:17.360]  to be closed while liquor stores were open and abortion clinics were open and retail
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.080]  stores were open.
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:26.920]  What you could take away is that these judges said, as judges, we have no more noble duty
[1:14:26.920 --> 1:14:34.960]  than to preserve the rights of our citizens from and protect them from government overreach.
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:41.760]  Therefore, we find the governor's orders against the defendant unconstitutional.
[1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:45.640]  They're talking like the framers of the United States of America.
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:52.200]  And where better to have a win than in Louisiana, the great state of Louisiana, where a democratic
[1:14:52.200 --> 1:15:01.600]  governor who is the poster child for the Biden policies and for our democratic policies and
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:09.120]  even in a Republican-led legislature, we got no help from the legislature.
[1:15:09.120 --> 1:15:15.320]  We got several losses in the district, federal, and the circuit courts, but now the highest
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:19.480]  court in the state of Louisiana came through for us in five to two.
[1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:27.760]  They said things like that your religious rights are inviolate, meaning you cannot violate
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:28.760]  them.
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:30.560]  You do not have the authority to violate them.
[1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:33.840]  They said that our religious rights are inalible.
[1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:39.800]  There was only one written dissent, and that was by the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:45.520]  Weimer, who had zero law in his two-and-a-half-page dissent.
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.520]  It was all emotional and sensational.
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:52.280]  Pastor Spill, I can tell, we're going to post a link in the live show feed to the ruling,
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:53.520]  but I can tell you want to go through it.
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:56.040]  So we're going to give you the floor when we come back.
[1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:57.040]  And this is amazing.
[1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:58.040]  Stay with us.
[1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.040]  We'll be right back.

[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:48.520]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available
[1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:53.320]  at infowarstore.com and again, this shirt is limited edition as well, we're doing one
[1:19:53.320 --> 1:20:00.800]  more run and then no more infowarstore.com, get yours today.
[1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:30.640]  Starting up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:42.040]  You know, America's not perfect compared to the rest of the world, it's incredible because
[1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:49.360]  it's founding ideas, ordained and inspired by God, and I have to thank Pastor Tony Spell
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:56.240]  in Louisiana and Baton Rouge for his courage for my children's birthright and their future
[1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:01.040]  because our ancestors fought for freedom and now we've got to do it and he stood up and
[1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:06.080]  he got arrested and he got shut down, he got fined, he got attacked, but he persevered
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:09.600]  and now has had this big victory that they're trying to black out, they're trying to shut
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:14.800]  down, they're trying to cover up, but here's what's really important, just as important
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.640]  as what I just said, Fauci and the UN have announced they got plans for new lockdowns
[1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:24.400]  after the midterms, this is their planetary control system, this is their world treaty
[1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:29.040]  they're getting set up, this is how the beast system's coming in with this digital tracking
[1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:34.920]  vaccine passport, so the tip of the spear is what Pastor Spell is doing, you got the
[1:21:34.920 --> 1:21:38.640]  ruling right there, it's a big deal for the First Amendment, for the press, not just
[1:21:38.640 --> 1:21:43.280]  for churches, it's absolutely amazing, please continue Pastor.
[1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:48.440]  On page seven of this beautiful five to two precedent setting ruling from the Louisiana
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:54.360]  Supreme Court, Justice Crane stated, no liberty is more essential to the continued by-law
[1:21:54.360 --> 1:22:00.480]  vitality of the free society, which our constitution guarantees, than is the religious liberty,
[1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:08.440]  the most sacred right to freely exercise one's religion is both fundamental and inalible.
[1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:15.920]  So for the past 27 months, as I've said, we've been arrested, put on house arrests,
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:21.160]  forbidden to travel, been out of the city of Baton Rouge four times in the past 27 months
[1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:26.520]  because of bond restrictions and what have you, however, the victory came on Friday the
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:33.920]  13th, that used to be the day notoriously and infamously noted as an evil day or for
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:40.160]  nightmares and murdering what had been Hollywood, but the Louisiana Supreme Court have now taken
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:47.800]  that day for the Lord Jesus Christ when they said, your rights were violated because you
[1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:52.080]  were arrested for holding church during the pandemic.
[1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:58.840]  Now, Alex, something very important to take away, if Amara will last long enough, in the
[1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:05.800]  history books, you can quote state of Louisiana versus Spale, instead of the 1906 Jacobson
[1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:10.840]  versus Massachusetts, where the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of a Swedish
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:15.720]  born pastor, because he refused to take the smallpox vaccine.
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:18.040]  He claimed religious exemption.
[1:23:18.040 --> 1:23:23.240]  You won't have to quote Smith versus division of employment, state of Oregon, who was terminated
[1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:29.560]  from his job because this native American would smoke peyote as part of his religious
[1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:33.480]  conviction and worship ceremonial rights.
[1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:39.280]  And he won, of course, in the Supreme Court because he was terminated from his employer
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:40.680]  in the state of Oregon.
[1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:42.960]  You won't have to quote that anymore.
[1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:50.840]  We have pure as the driven snow, the purest wind and religious history in our great nation,
[1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:56.240]  in the five to two state of Louisiana versus Spale, where they wanted to imprison me for
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:24:03.720]  six months per violation, six months per violation without fines, but six months of imprisonment.
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:10.560]  And we were facing several years in prison, but these beautiful justices in the great
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:16.000]  state of Louisiana came through and said, Governor John Mell Edwards, what you've done
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.480]  was unconstitutional legal.
[1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:24.200]  His emergency orders were so irrelevant and full of holes.
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:30.560]  They say in here that going to and from an individual's place of worship was legal.
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.200]  However, you could not go into the place of worship.
[1:24:34.200 --> 1:24:41.600]  They go on to say that you could go into a retail store with hundreds or 10,000 cars.
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:48.520]  We go into a retail store several hundred feet from my church on a day-to-day basis.
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:54.560]  But if the same people would walk across the street into a cavernous 106,000 square feet
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:25:01.160]  building on 41 acres, they would be arrested and cited for violation of the law.
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:04.480]  Number one, there was no law made.
[1:25:04.480 --> 1:25:06.440]  We never broke a law.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:09.760]  However, the executives broke laws.
[1:25:09.760 --> 1:25:11.360]  The governors broke laws.
[1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:13.480]  The mayors broke laws.
[1:25:13.480 --> 1:25:21.000]  These lesser magistrates, policemen and sheriffs broke laws whenever they arrested us and forbade
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.200]  us to preach.
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:23.960]  You know what this has been about?
[1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:25.960]  It's spiritual warfare, Alex.
[1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:33.320]  We just had a health freedom rally where people like Dr. Peter McCullough and Drs. Rhett
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:37.320]  Bazuan came together and said, this has all been spiritual.
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:42.800]  The virus and the attack against the church and the First Amendment has been spiritual.
[1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:45.120]  So it's spiritual warfare.
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:50.000]  I'm glad McCullough, who's in studio tomorrow, said that because privately, I said, you've
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  looked at this.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  You're a smart guy.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  We're now a scientist.
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  Not as a cardiologist.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  What do you think is happening?
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.920]  And you look at how they're doing and it's so sophisticated.
[1:25:57.920 --> 1:26:00.480]  It's that mystery of evil.
[1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:04.400]  It is the mystery of iniquity that already worked.
[1:26:04.400 --> 1:26:10.440]  Only he who now led it, the word led in the Greek of 2 Thessalonians 2.7 means the hinder.
[1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:19.000]  That means you and I are hindering this Antichrist spirit government from taking over our nation
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.520]  because we know that if America falls, the rest of the world falls.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:27.280]  And how obvious to erupt, Pastor, you're on target here is that they've attacked churches
[1:26:27.280 --> 1:26:29.120]  not just here, but worldwide during these lockdowns.
[1:26:29.120 --> 1:26:30.720]  It shows they fear the brethren.
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.320]  Talk about multiculturalism.
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:39.360]  Your church is the example of love and coming together and what they fear 27 different nationalities.
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:45.200]  They hate that because they went through division and conquering, but we have perfect unity.
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.840]  Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:54.760]  That's why they wanted to six feet apart because they don't want us together.
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:00.160]  That's why they wanted us muzzled in mass because the first thing they did in these Western
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:05.240]  movies when they hung someone was that they covered their face so they become an inanimate
[1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:07.520]  object and they dehumanized them.
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:15.320]  And that's what they tried to do for 27 months, 336 services of breaking their fake laws and
[1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:21.640]  holding unrestrained, unlimited gatherings in our local church.
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:26.960]  We had zero masking, zero vaccine, zero socialism distancing.
[1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:27.960]  And you know what?
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:36.280]  The Supreme Court in the state of Louisiana said, you were right, Alex, 39 buses go out
[1:27:36.280 --> 1:27:43.680]  every Sunday morning from this church covering an 80 mile radius, bringing in all races of
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:51.440]  people, all walks of life, all political persuasions, bringing them in where we feed them a hot
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:57.960]  meal and then we give them spiritual food and then we have baptisms and pray for people.
[1:27:57.960 --> 1:27:58.960]  And you know what?
[1:27:58.960 --> 1:28:06.280]  We're telling them that God is greater than the virus, faith is stronger than fear.
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:12.880]  And because of that, as I've stated, impurable diseases have been healed and so much.
[1:28:12.880 --> 1:28:19.160]  But now our attorney, Jeff Wittenbrink, who is our local representation, Chief Justice
[1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:23.280]  Roy Moore, who also represents us.
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:28.120]  Here's what Jeff Wittenbrink, he said to me, he said, Pastor, the First Amendment does
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:31.800]  not give you your right to go to church and peaceably assemble.
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:36.120]  The First Amendment protects your right to practice your religion, go to church and
[1:28:36.120 --> 1:28:37.880]  peaceably assemble.
[1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:45.800]  Your right and duty to go to church and practice your religion is endowed to you by your creator,
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:47.560]  God Almighty.
[1:28:47.560 --> 1:28:50.240]  And that's who the government wants to be.
[1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:52.720]  There are some pockets of resistance in government.
[1:28:52.720 --> 1:28:54.280]  Let's talk about that, Pastor.
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:55.280]  Got to go to break.
[1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:56.280]  We'll come back.
[1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:57.280]  You're on fire.

[1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:51.560]  together would not have happened.
[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:55.080]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear and I salute you and thank you.
[1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:58.200]  Visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:31:58.200 --> 1:31:59.760]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:04.000]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:09.600]  Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the US government gain of function deliberative
[1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:15.280]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influence
[1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:16.640]  of MERS and ZARS viruses.
[1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:20.840]  There's nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding pause.
[1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:21.840]  It's not a stop.
[1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:22.840]  It's not a prohibition.
[1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:26.880]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign, you stop, you look
[1:32:26.880 --> 1:32:31.600]  both ways and then you proceed and so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function,
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:36.000]  just selected gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.360]  and qualification research though, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was
[1:32:40.360 --> 1:32:41.360]  right.
[1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:43.720]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function, you know,
[1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:45.280]  that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:48.600]  That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:53.200]  life forms that mimic what the viruses do, but in the main definition, it's still a gain
[1:32:53.200 --> 1:32:54.200]  of function.
[1:32:54.200 --> 1:32:56.720]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:32:56.720 --> 1:32:57.720]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:32:57.720 --> 1:33:00.720]  We love you.
[1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:26.040]  You know, we can't forget about the pastors arrested in Europe and the UK and Canada and
[1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:27.560]  the U.S.
[1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:32.120]  Pastor Argyr Poloski held for months without bail now on house arrest, arrested what six
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:39.200]  times for preaching the gospel and keeping his church open in Canada.
[1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:41.560]  That is what is going on.
[1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:43.240]  That is what is happening.
[1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:48.520]  Their desire from the U.N. down is to shut down our religious freedom and particularly
[1:33:48.520 --> 1:33:49.520]  target Christians.
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:53.560]  The U.N. even admits in the last decade, persecution of Christians doubled and then
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:56.920]  tripled the level it was just a decade ago.
[1:33:56.920 --> 1:34:02.600]  This is a satanic world government being announced, market the beast, implantable microchips.
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:04.120]  Next time I'm going to cover all that.
[1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:06.640]  The Pastor Tony Spell, we know there's going to be a giant revival.
[1:34:06.640 --> 1:34:11.000]  The Bible tells us so during this period, that the great falling away and the great
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.240]  awakening, I'm not going to pretend to be a theologian or to even guess when Christ comes
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:16.240]  like a thief in the night.
[1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:20.880]  But clearly, prophecy is being fulfilled and this historic victory you've had, and I've
[1:34:20.880 --> 1:34:21.880]  read the ruling as well.
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:22.880]  It's posted on infowars.com.
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:27.520]  The live show feed is just incredible and the media spends it like, oh, you're out of
[1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:28.520]  trouble now.
[1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:29.520]  Okay, you were bad.
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:31.040]  But the court said it was okay.
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:32.640]  No, they violated our rights.
[1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:34.080]  They violated your rights.
[1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:38.960]  They violated our sacred First Amendment that, as you said, guards our God-given rights.
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:41.240]  This is a raping that we've been through.
[1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:42.800]  You did your duty.
[1:34:42.800 --> 1:34:44.880]  You held fast.
[1:34:44.880 --> 1:34:46.680]  And now you've been vindicated.
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:50.920]  But the fight is so important because we know more lockdowns are coming, as I said.
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:54.680]  And we know that it is the First Amendment that stands against forced inoculations and
[1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:56.720]  stands against martial law.
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:57.720]  And so thank you again.
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:34:59.240]  And I know you don't want the thanks, but it's true.
[1:34:59.240 --> 1:35:01.320]  And you're a congregation standing with you.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:04.640]  And I know I read it got even bigger once this persecution happened.
[1:35:04.640 --> 1:35:09.720]  So if we just lean into the attack and don't tower, God will use us for greater things.
[1:35:09.720 --> 1:35:10.720]  Is that not true?
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:13.120]  That is the absolute truth.
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:19.000]  Ephesians 6-10, finally my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:24.960]  Your strength is either derived from God Almighty or from another power.
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:27.520]  Saul was the people's choice.
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:30.520]  He was head and shoulders above every man in Israel.
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:35.120]  However, before he died, a suicide, he consorted with witches.
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:38.760]  He derived his power from another world, hell itself.
[1:35:38.760 --> 1:35:41.880]  So there are two classes of people in government today.
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:45.320]  See, as Lewis said, there's no neutral ground in the universe.
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:49.000]  Another square inch every split second is either claimed by God or counterclaimed by
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:50.160]  the devil.
[1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:51.720]  So here we are.
[1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:56.200]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, Ephesians 6-12, but against principalities.
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:00.840]  Number one, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, three, and
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:05.200]  against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:10.960]  Political powers, supreme court powers in the judicial branch, legislative powers in
[1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:14.120]  the Senate and the Congress and then the executive branch.
[1:36:14.120 --> 1:36:20.240]  There are individuals that are possessed by God Almighty or they are possessed by Satan
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:22.680]  and that's what we're fighting against.
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:28.040]  It's not crazy Joe or it's not Kamala and her cackling.
[1:36:28.040 --> 1:36:35.120]  It's not King Edwards and his anti-God, godless orders that he gives.
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:41.720]  These people are empowered and possessed by another world and we have righteous leaders
[1:36:41.720 --> 1:36:46.080]  when the righteous are in power, the people rejoice.
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:50.520]  But when the unrighteous are in power, the people mourn because we know it's tyranny.
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:53.160]  So what do we have?
[1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:54.160]  Principalities.
[1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:59.720]  America has a principality right now and there is loneliness that has come upon us and even
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:05.720]  greater loneliness because of the seclusion and the reclusiveness that came from the lockdowns.
[1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:08.240]  Therefore we have an identity crisis.
[1:37:08.240 --> 1:37:16.200]  You have the LGBTQ community that wants to inculcate into our children this spiritual
[1:37:16.200 --> 1:37:21.560]  wickedness and the homos and the fags and the Twinkies and the queers.
[1:37:21.560 --> 1:37:26.800]  They want to redefine what humanity is like we have an identity crisis.
[1:37:26.800 --> 1:37:33.760]  No, man is made in God's image and after his likeness, the male and female created he them.
[1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:39.200]  That's who we represent, God, our father and the churches, our mother.
[1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:42.800]  That's why there's an attack to want to close down the church, Alex.
[1:37:42.800 --> 1:37:48.160]  They know if they can muzzle the preachers and the churches and close them.
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:54.120]  The next thing to go is the press and then the next thing to go will be assembly.
[1:37:54.120 --> 1:37:56.280]  All assemblies will be deemed illegal.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:57.280]  That's what Hitler did.
[1:37:57.280 --> 1:38:01.360]  And the stealing things, by weaponizing the courts, they're not all controlled, we just
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:02.360]  proved here with you.
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:06.960]  You're great work and then we've also got the attacks on our medical freedom and we've
[1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:10.640]  got the attacks on just everything.
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:12.080]  Exactly right.
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:14.000]  Spiritual wickedness in high places.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.480]  Now, though we walk in the flesh, Alex, we do not war after the flesh.
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:22.320]  I appreciate what you said in your previous segment.
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:23.440]  Who do we go after?
[1:38:23.440 --> 1:38:24.760]  Do we storm the capital?
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:26.840]  Do we take up arms?
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:29.440]  There's too many of them in the flesh.
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:33.320]  We have to use spiritual weapons to fight a spiritual battle.
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:37.080]  If we fight carnal battles with carnal weapons, carnality wins.
[1:38:37.080 --> 1:38:39.280]  So we need spiritual weapons.
[1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:41.520]  And this is a shark two-edged sword.
[1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:48.000]  This Bible is 66 books, 1189 chapters, 31,102 verses.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.440]  Here's what we pray every day, every day and throughout the day.
[1:38:52.440 --> 1:38:55.440]  And I want our audience to pray this as well.
[1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.920]  Please, Pastor Edison prayer, Pastor Tony Spell.
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:04.600]  Jeremiah 17, 18, let them be confounded that persecute me.
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:06.800]  Only let not me be confounded.
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:08.760]  Let them be dismayed.
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:10.840]  Only let not me be dismayed.
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:16.160]  Bring upon them the day of trouble and destroy them with double destruction.
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:18.880]  That's what Jeremiah prayed in the Old Testament.
[1:39:18.880 --> 1:39:21.040]  He knew his enemies were too big.
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:26.040]  He knew the opposition and the fierce force for what?
[1:39:26.040 --> 1:39:30.200]  Whenever you tell me that I have to vaccinate to go into the...
[1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:35.160]  They wouldn't even let me in the Louisiana Supreme Court with my attorneys.
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:36.120]  Do you know why?
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:41.200]  Because I was unvaccinated and I refused to pull a mask.
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:43.320]  And the Supreme Court took note of that.
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:49.680]  Now, when you tell me that in order to go across the threshold of my courthouse,
[1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:53.760]  that I have to have this in my veins, this needle in my veins,
[1:39:53.760 --> 1:39:56.160]  that is apocalyptic territory, Alex.
[1:39:56.160 --> 1:40:00.680]  Revelation 13, 17, it says that no man might buy or sell,
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:02.840]  say he had the names, the number of the mark.
[1:40:02.840 --> 1:40:09.400]  That is apocalyptic territory when you tell me that I have to mask or I have to vaccinate
[1:40:09.400 --> 1:40:12.240]  in order to go to this school or go to this church.
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:16.560]  Would you believe that there are actually religious organizations right now
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:20.800]  that put the unvaccinated, lower class people in the balcony
[1:40:20.800 --> 1:40:25.240]  and the vaccinated people on the floor in general population?
[1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.280]  That's spiritual wickedness.
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:33.120]  Whenever you tell us that we can't go to a job or can't go to a place of worship
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:36.600]  or a place of business because we don't have our car,
[1:40:36.600 --> 1:40:40.480]  we're no longer the great republic that we once were.
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:47.880]  But I'm telling you, there is hope because of this ruling on Friday the 13th of May, 2022, Alex.
[1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:50.240]  All of that has gone away.
[1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:55.880]  We had law on our side, but now the judges, five out of seven judges
[1:40:55.880 --> 1:41:00.960]  in the Louisiana Supreme Court says, you can go to state of Louisiana versus spell
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:04.440]  and you can tell your employer, no, I'm not going to vaccinate.
[1:41:04.440 --> 1:41:07.760]  You can tell that place of business, no, I'm not going to mask.
[1:41:07.760 --> 1:41:13.080]  You can tell your pastor, you can tell them we can keep our church open.
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:14.920]  We're not going to be arrested again.
[1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:17.120]  We're not going to be persecuted again.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:22.480]  This is a beautiful win and it's the purest win in America's history.
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:25.520]  I read the ruling and I've talked to lawyers that are involved.
[1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:28.080]  You're the first member of the issues, you're right.
[1:41:28.080 --> 1:41:34.200]  This is the strongest, purest ruling at the key time when we know they're coming for us again.
[1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:39.840]  And I mean, back when you were saying no and being arrested and all this,
[1:41:39.840 --> 1:41:41.520]  obviously you were doing it because you knew it was the right thing.
[1:41:41.520 --> 1:41:48.280]  But did you have faith that you know that you'd be victorious?
[1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:53.600]  Well, I knew that I'd be victorious in God, but I was standing on the word of God, Alex.
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.000]  And the word of God clearly stated, do not forsake the assembling.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:58.800]  The word means synagoguing in Greek.
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:42:02.640]  It means going to church of ourselves together.
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:09.440]  And we had over 105 verses like that from the Bible in this particular lawsuit in our civil case,
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.640]  which is ultimately going to go to the United States Supreme Court.
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:17.040]  Okay, whenever I bonded out of the East Baton Rouge Parish prison
[1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:22.320]  and then Judge Fred T. Krafasi from the 19th Judicial District Court fitted me in an ankle bracelet
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:24.880]  and forbid me to leave the front door of my house.
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:28.880]  The majority of my church came through my doors here at my home
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:33.840]  and I met with my two sons, my daughter, my son and grandsons and wife.
[1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:36.760]  And I said, you know, a conviction.
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:39.560]  Neither the five things tell you if you have a conviction,
[1:42:39.560 --> 1:42:46.520]  neither the pressure of your friends, your family, lawsuit, jail or death will stop you from practicing that.
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:51.320]  Well, we all knew that I would go into the prison until the court system opened,
[1:42:51.320 --> 1:42:53.400]  which was an indefinite amount of time then.
[1:42:53.400 --> 1:42:56.280]  Stay there. Final segment. Incredible. Pastor Tony Spell, stay with us.
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:43:03.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have contracted with one of the top companies in the United States
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:07.880]  that supplies the Pentagon, the military, the CIA, the FBI, you name it,
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:13.960]  with super high quality Faraday cages for cell phones, laptops, iPads, even huge bags
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:18.360]  for multiple desktops. This is so critical, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:43:18.360 --> 1:43:21.720]  going into the future with contact tracers and the New World Order.
[1:43:21.720 --> 1:43:23.880]  Everything is about tracking you and your family.
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:26.760]  And we have this high quality Made America product line,
[1:43:26.760 --> 1:43:33.960]  exclusively available, private label by us, known as Redux at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:33.960 --> 1:43:38.840]  So go to infowarstore.com and check out Redux. It's our first big run.
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:41.800]  We've made a major investment to have this produced and ready,

[1:44:23.080 --> 1:44:27.800]  and make us go away quietly. With practically half the population
[1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:33.320]  wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:40.520]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially. So be it. Make them silence us by force.
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:47.400]  This is the final battle of the information war. Give now. Buy products. Donate.
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:52.760]  Before everything changes, we need you to carry us through to the end.
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:56.680]  Victory or death, go now to infowarstore.com.
[1:44:58.520 --> 1:45:02.680]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:06.600]  They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:11.640]  advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers,
[1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:15.880]  that the family, as we know it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:21.080]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:25.480]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:45:25.480 --> 1:45:29.960]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[1:45:29.960 --> 1:45:33.480]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[1:45:34.040 --> 1:45:38.360]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:42.280]  nurturative and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:48.680]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:53.480]  and coming together. They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:58.120]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.

[1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:05.960]  Okay. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:16.360 --> 1:47:20.280]  Well, he had menomalus over a year and I look forward to speaking to him again in the future.
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:24.040]  We really appreciate the incredible work he's doing, fighting, tearing at every level,
[1:47:24.040 --> 1:47:28.040]  Pastor Tony spells our guest here on the Alex Jones show, final segment. And I've been asking
[1:47:28.040 --> 1:47:33.000]  a lot of questions, but I want to try to give him the floor to cover any other angles or areas he
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  wants to hit. He got caught off by the break talking about when he was put in jail, when he was
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:41.720]  facing prison, when they put the ankle bracelet on him. He wasn't ashamed of that. He knew he was
[1:47:41.720 --> 1:47:47.560]  following the footsteps of other leaders that God has risen up and stood up against this.
[1:47:47.560 --> 1:47:51.640]  And now he's been victorious. That's my greatest frustration is I've been on here 28 years.
[1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:56.680]  And every time I don't back down and something bad happens, and I just say, I trust you, God,
[1:47:57.560 --> 1:48:02.680]  we get stronger on the other side. It's amazing. We worship the real God that made the universe,
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:08.040]  the real God that loves us, and we need to rejoice in that. And as bad as things are going to get,
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:14.200]  understand that that promise is eternal and real. And as long as we bring God into our lives and
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.720]  admit our sins and ask God to make us reborn to Christ, we can be with Christ forever. If not,
[1:48:19.720 --> 1:48:23.160]  we are going to be cut off. And that's a fate worse than death, obviously.
[1:48:23.160 --> 1:48:26.600]  So Pastor, I want you to finish up with the persecution and then just big picture.
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:32.120]  What a time to rejoice that revelation is being fulfilled in front of us. It's just incredible
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:35.080]  the power of that double-edged sword you were holding up earlier.
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:43.160]  Yes, sir. Alex. So on that night prior, I was a Saturday evening and the judge says,
[1:48:43.160 --> 1:48:47.000]  if you go back to your church and preach, we're going to put you in prison
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.160]  in indefinite amount of time until the courts reopen and we can arrange you.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:58.120]  And so I met with my family and we had a very emotional time because it was an emotional time
[1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:03.080]  because they says, we don't want you to go to jail. We know that you're going to.
[1:49:03.720 --> 1:49:08.920]  And of course, we did meet that morning. I told the judge, I said, you give me two hours
[1:49:08.920 --> 1:49:13.960]  with our church. I want one final sermon. We brought all the Sunday school children in together.
[1:49:13.960 --> 1:49:19.720]  It was a beautiful thing. 27 different nationalities come together and people from all over the city
[1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:26.680]  here. And of course, at the end of that service, while the law enforcement was in route to bring
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:33.640]  me back into the prison, there was a standoff. A gunman actually killed one of the policemen.
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:39.880]  And another guy was injured. Another guy was permanently injured, handicapped.
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:45.080]  Some attorneys say to the judge and the district attorney, you have real crime to fight. Leave
[1:49:45.080 --> 1:49:53.240]  this pastor alone. What's happening? What is happening is we have resistance. Only he who
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:49:59.480]  now let us will let until he be taken out of the way. When the church is not hindering,
[1:50:00.280 --> 1:50:06.120]  as it's supposed to for the past 27 months, look at the looting and the murdering and the burning.
[1:50:06.120 --> 1:50:13.560]  Look at the riots. Look at the crime. Number five in the nation for murder right here within a 20
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.680]  mile radius of our church. Those that know the Bible like you pastor, hindering means we are,
[1:50:18.680 --> 1:50:25.160]  we as a church are to stand against evil and hold it back. And when we refuse to stand against it
[1:50:25.160 --> 1:50:30.520]  and hold it back, look at the onslaught that has come in into our schools and our,
[1:50:30.520 --> 1:50:36.600]  and our White House. Look at what's happened. They have hijacked Washington Devil's city, D.C.
[1:50:36.600 --> 1:50:44.520]  Here's your scripture. Isaiah 5417. No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper.
[1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:49.960]  The weapon will be formed, but it's not going to prosper. And every lying tongue that rises up
[1:50:49.960 --> 1:50:58.120]  against the judgment, thou shalt condemn. That's our job. The lies and the slander and the defamatory
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:02.200]  language. That's our job. What you're saying is we're waiting on God to do it all. God has
[1:51:02.200 --> 1:51:08.200]  empowered us to do it. It's our job. It's our duty. It's not just our duty and obligation.
[1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:14.920]  It's our right and our privilege. What would I say to my sons and grandsons? What would I say
[1:51:14.920 --> 1:51:21.320]  to the unborn generations from my loins to, for them to know that I closed the church
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:30.440]  at the, at the request, at the orders of a godless governor and a mayor and, and, and senator? What
[1:51:30.440 --> 1:51:35.800]  would they say when Daniel went to the Den of Lions? When Daniel was faced with the decision,
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:40.360]  it did not take him long to declare. He'd rather spend the night with lions than spend one night
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:47.080]  without prayer. What would I say on judgment day to the three Hebrew boys who refused to bow? And
[1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:53.000]  you know what their king did? He heated the furnace up seven times hotter. He turned up the heat.
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:58.600]  Well, because of this wind, get ready, because the tyrants are fixing to turn up the heat,
[1:51:58.600 --> 1:52:04.200]  because the devil never forgives and he never forgets and he hates to lose. So he's got us on
[1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:10.120]  his hit list. That's why you are under such persecution, Alex. That's why info wars is under
[1:52:10.120 --> 1:52:17.000]  such persecution and is, and is stifling and is tried and is trying to be quash. You know why?
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:23.720]  Because you speak the truth and where truth is lies have to run go hide and where light is darkness
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:30.520]  has to run. So it's our duty and obligation to fight against evil and tyranny and the satanic
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:36.440]  forces that are trying to come against the church. That's why young people are being slaughtered
[1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:44.200]  every day in our in our nation cities. That's why abortion is so rampant and gay rights are
[1:52:44.200 --> 1:52:51.400]  so rampant. Why? Because the church is not doing its job. But if God said if my people which are
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:56.200]  called by my name will hum of themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:02.200]  we'll hear from heaven. We need repentance in our land because the blood of 60 million babies
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:07.480]  in the most safe place in the world and mother's womb is crying out against us from the ground.
[1:53:08.120 --> 1:53:17.720]  We need repentance in our land while evil God give us men like you times like this demand
[1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:23.480]  strong minds great hearts true faith and ready hands men whom the lust of office does not kill
[1:53:23.480 --> 1:53:30.440]  men whom the spoils of office cannot buy men who have honor men who will not lie men who can stand
[1:53:30.440 --> 1:53:36.520]  before a demigod and damn his treacherous flatters without winking tall men sun crown who live above
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:42.040]  the fog and godly duty and christian thinking for while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds
[1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:48.360]  large professions and little deeds mingling selfish strife freedom weeps wrong rules the land
[1:53:48.360 --> 1:53:54.440]  waiting justice sleeps but this word is a sharp two-edged sword there's not a governor that can
[1:53:54.440 --> 1:54:00.120]  stand against this word there's not a mayor there's not a crooked policeman there's not a senator
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:05.240]  a congressman there's not a president of the united states even if he is falsely elected
[1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:11.160]  that can stand against this sharp two-edged sword you know what we've lost faith in all of our
[1:54:11.160 --> 1:54:16.920]  government systems the supreme court here has come through for us but it's time for us to put our
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:23.320]  faith back where it belongs in god almighty in the word of the lord because when it comes down to it
[1:54:23.320 --> 1:54:28.280]  this is the only weapon that's going to win at the end of the day make no mistake about it let no
[1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:36.200]  man deceive you and we are in mass deception right now mass formation psychosis and the deception
[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:42.840]  has become the majority in society and you and i have become the minority you know what i and ran
[1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:48.440]  said whose books are banned in public school libraries you said when you see that in order to
[1:54:48.440 --> 1:54:54.360]  produce that you must gain permission from those who produce nothing when you see that money is
[1:54:54.360 --> 1:55:01.320]  flowing to those who deal in favors and not in goods when you see that men grow richer by graft
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:06.360]  and by pull and that your laws do not protect you against them but protect them against you
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:10.840]  when you see corruption rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice then you may know that
[1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:18.680]  your society is doomed society may be doomed but we still can't be fatalists who give up we've got
[1:55:18.680 --> 1:55:23.720]  to stand up like never before and preach the truth that's what you're doing on this program
[1:55:23.720 --> 1:55:29.160]  that's what we're doing right now we're telling the truth and speaking it in love you know what
[1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:36.680]  in baton rouge louisiana the bible belt of america the right to life in the louisiana family form
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:43.160]  is calling women who have abortions victims they're not victims if a child is molested and
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:49.160]  raped that child is a victim if a woman is physically abused by her husband she's a victim
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:56.280]  a victim doesn't need to repent but a woman that kills her baby needs to repent she's not a victim
[1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:04.040]  the child is the victim that's what we're facing in america and and coming from the supreme court
[1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:10.760]  that leak as wrong as it was they're going to send the power back to the states last friday we had
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:17.720]  a meeting in the state capital here and we had a beautiful bill to overturn abortion in our state

[2:00:05.480 --> 2:00:12.840]  ex-head of respiratory research at fiser mike yedend and researchers including kreg part of cooper
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:20.440]  have sourced veyer's data on vaccine death and injury in the u.s a database of over 700 000
[2:00:20.440 --> 2:00:28.200]  adverse reactions caused by the moderna fiser and jansen vaccines these vaccines have been deployed
[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:34.920]  in different batches officially referred to as lots this has allowed yedens team to back engineer big
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:43.240]  pharma's cov-19 vaccine employment agenda in the u.s all their information is published how bad is my batch dot com
[2:00:43.240 --> 2:00:50.600]  and how bad dot info and what we learn is quite telling about 0.5 percent of all the different
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:58.120]  batches are highly toxic resulting in hospitalization disability and death within days or weeks of
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:05.720]  injection other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos when
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:11.400]  plotting on a timeline we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:17.720]  monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches while one company is deploying a
[2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:23.240]  lethal batch the other two deploy harmless ones creating the scientific environment to
[2:01:23.240 --> 2:01:31.480]  perform dose range finding or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch the timeline shows
[2:01:31.480 --> 2:01:38.360]  that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period allowing them time to
[2:01:38.360 --> 2:01:44.360]  establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed private leaked documents from
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:51.720]  the cdc show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included the very same lots
[2:01:51.720 --> 2:01:57.240]  found to be highly toxic in part of cooper's database which makes sense there would be no
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:04.120]  reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo only the deadly ones this mode of
[2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:09.800]  deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations
[2:02:10.600 --> 2:02:18.040]  such as red states analysis of the number of dying per 100 000 vaccinated in 50 states
[2:02:18.040 --> 2:02:22.840]  shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:30.440]  some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states on average
[2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:35.000]  red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:40.920]  after ruling out other possibilities part of cooper concluded that this can only be due to the
[2:02:40.920 --> 2:02:48.200]  fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did
[2:02:48.200 --> 2:02:54.040]  among several other crimes they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people
[2:02:54.040 --> 2:03:01.640]  who voted against the new world order's woke build back better great reset while at the same time
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:07.880]  endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners and it's happening right now
[2:03:07.880 --> 2:03:11.880]  now reporting for info wars this is greg reese
[2:03:26.520 --> 2:03:33.240]  when you have us senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke russia first
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:37.720]  and the russians are aware that's almost happened before what do you think that makes the russians
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:44.600]  do well it makes them go into war mode so i don't like them invading ukraine i don't like
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:50.040]  him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert only one level above that on their death con just
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:57.720]  like our system and that's fire the weapons and so now we have democrats all over the news saying
[2:03:57.720 --> 2:04:04.280]  let's just use nuclear weapons on russia think of their ignorance russia has hundreds of submarines
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:10.600]  off our coast with sea launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:17.160]  average of being launched sea launched cruise missiles that fly it mock by land launch system
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:23.080]  they can also launch from ships that are at mock nine and cannot be shot down and and yes the united
[2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:28.680]  states has those two that's a pentagon lie that the rest of developed systems that we don't have
[2:04:28.680 --> 2:04:34.840]  it's on record the u.s has those systems the point is it's called mutually assured destruction
[2:04:34.840 --> 2:04:41.800]  or mad for a reason because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane and you know
[2:04:41.800 --> 2:04:45.720]  i'm on the side of not having nuclear war especially when russia is not starting to fight
[2:04:45.720 --> 2:04:50.120]  with us and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country's
[2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:54.200]  run by russia when that was all a giant lie the globalists are the outside evil force

[2:06:22.920 --> 2:06:29.080]  jones you're us all right so we've been hammering on this for six months since we knew they were
[2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:34.600]  getting it ready thank god the listeners here have gotten the word out really the credit goes to you
[2:06:34.600 --> 2:06:41.160]  but now it's all over the nose you've got the un heads and bill gates and the corporate heads
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:46.760]  and the democratic party and the eu bureaucrats saying we need to have the un run things we need
[2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:51.320]  to have the un control everything why things didn't work well under the pandemic that they released
[2:06:52.120 --> 2:06:58.120]  and so we need to do this everything they're betting on back when we got documents in 2006
[2:06:58.120 --> 2:07:04.920]  i put it in the film in game 2007 traditional watch suit and got them thousands of pages about
[2:07:04.920 --> 2:07:10.440]  how they would use the threat of a virus to bring in a world digital i d card and out of that a
[2:07:10.440 --> 2:07:16.120]  carbon tax a social credit score and a universal basic income after they shut the economy down
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:22.200]  to make you dependent now that was theoretical back then fast forward to two and a half years ago
[2:07:22.200 --> 2:07:28.280]  they launched the operation and now we're deep in to their attempted takeover and here are just stacks
[2:07:28.280 --> 2:07:35.000]  of articles uh and videos today dealing with this australia set the sign geneva's global pandemic
[2:07:35.000 --> 2:07:44.600]  treaty but they haven't even released what the treaty is but they've told us what it is in pieces
[2:07:44.600 --> 2:07:51.480]  and it's bad meanwhile deaths in new zealand are rising again and they're their record high despite
[2:07:51.480 --> 2:07:59.640]  95 percent of everyone over 12 in the country having three to four shots and the mass mandate
[2:08:00.680 --> 2:08:08.520]  total fraud continuing why is he reading a script from the world economic forum
[2:08:08.520 --> 2:08:12.760]  there is no science that backs up anything he's saying we'll play that clip in a moment
[2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:21.880]  all lies that in 2030 is the only thing that matters health canada is too chicken bleep to release
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:27.880]  their infant statistics on the vaccinated deaths this week and it goes on from there as they talk
[2:08:27.880 --> 2:08:33.880]  about how they're not going to release it this is all a test on to see how they can kill us
[2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:39.320]  marco rubio asked a question how do we tell american citizens that if you test positive you
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:45.160]  can't enter your own country but if you arrive illegally whether you test positive or not you
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:52.120]  say the magic words asylum and you get to stay fouchy i don't have an answer to that fouchy says
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:59.320]  it was never a lockdown america but the churches were shut down for over a year and it goes on from
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:06.600]  there that's where we are and so there's a treaty that they say creates a world id and creates the
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:12.280]  power to lock up and force me inoculate anybody they want harry truman signed on to the who and
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:17.800]  gave it carte blanche power in 47 we have to reverse that and say that's wrong same guy gave us
[2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:23.560]  the cia in 47 but now they're making their move so we're already signed on to it so there doesn't
[2:09:23.560 --> 2:09:27.640]  even need to be a ratification they're saying to put us under implementation but here's the thing
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:32.520]  the cdc said last year they were controlling all rents in america and that they could lock up
[2:09:32.520 --> 2:09:37.560]  anybody they wanted but the courts the people said no so just because these criminals say something
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:42.840]  doesn't mean it's gospel and that's what's really in the news is the press releases from last week
[2:09:42.840 --> 2:09:48.760]  the who and the un are under the command of the world economic forum the debauchess group which
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:53.720]  is the builder group we have lived to see the builder group with a medical scare with a virus
[2:09:53.720 --> 2:09:59.880]  they created with poison shots making their move on civilization now how incredible is that
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:06.040]  that big article breaks this down biden handing over us sovereignty to the world health organization
[2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:13.400]  here's another one climate marshal plan worldwide lockdowns shut down of all fossil fuels
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:19.480]  un joins world economic forum un joins world economic forum called end oil gas and coal
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:27.240]  use period which would kill billions un chief calls for climate marshal plan what did prince
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:36.280]  charles five months ago called for a worldwide military operation to end carbon we excel we
[2:10:36.280 --> 2:10:46.440]  exhale carbon dioxide plants then produce oxygen it's the carbon cycle we're carbon based life
[2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:52.840]  forms talk about aliens i mean these people are attacking the very life system of the earth all
[2:10:52.840 --> 2:10:57.560]  that stored up carbon from the ages now that we're terraforming back up into the atmosphere
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:03.880]  right when carbon dioxide levels were lowered 500 years ago it's just if god had it all planned
[2:11:03.880 --> 2:11:10.680]  here is prince charles first they'll get to clip 11 9 and 5 talking a few months ago about this
[2:11:10.680 --> 2:11:17.720]  worldwide military action with more money than's ever been spent in the world to transform the
[2:11:17.720 --> 2:11:24.840]  planet but not to innovate but to shut off the infrastructure so ladies and gentlemen my plea
[2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:31.480]  today is for countries to come together to create the environment that enables every sector of
[2:11:31.480 --> 2:11:39.160]  industry to take the action required we know this will take trillions not billions of dollars
[2:11:40.200 --> 2:11:45.800]  we also know that countries many of whom are burdened by growing levels of debt
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:55.080]  simply cannot afford to go green here we need a vast military style campaign to marshal the strength
[2:11:55.080 --> 2:12:04.440]  of the global private sector with trillions at his disposal far beyond global GDP and with the
[2:12:04.440 --> 2:12:11.720]  greatest respect beyond even the governments of the world's leaders it offers the only real prospect
[2:12:11.720 --> 2:12:21.320]  of achieving fundamental economic transition it's all about massive depopulation all about central
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:26.840]  banks controlling the free market to bankrupt you for a social credit score now that's charles
[2:12:26.840 --> 2:12:36.040]  months ago here is charles currently yesterday necessary and we've built again in a greener
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:42.040]  and more sustainable and more inclusive way then we will end up having more and more pandemics and
[2:12:42.040 --> 2:12:49.000]  more and more disasters from ever accelerating global warming and climate change so then we
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:55.560]  will end up having more and more pandemics and more and more disasters so what he's saying is
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:00.840]  it comes out of the jungles because you're bad no it comes out of Wuhan you cooked it up with
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:08.280]  Bill Gates so let us kill you let us cut your energy off let us depopulate or we're going to release
[2:13:08.280 --> 2:13:15.560]  more viruses now here is Tedros the head of the WHO literally paid off by Gates saying he trusts
[2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:22.920]  Bill Gates and Bill Gates is running things here it is I have known Bill and Melinda for
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:31.240]  for many many years now and have been working with them very closely not as a DJ but when I was in
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:40.520]  Ethiopia working in the Ministry of Health and and later on their commitment I mean these two
[2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:51.080]  human beings it's amazing you know having people like Bill and Melinda with big heart to support
[2:13:51.080 --> 2:14:02.920]  humanity it's something we should cherish I have seen them in action and I have seen
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:14.280]  their the outcome of all they have been trying to do and you know what I always say if we can
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:27.880]  have more people like them people who really genuinely support people who have that big heart
[2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:35.480]  and bring humanity before before anything so that's what I would like to assure you
[2:14:36.440 --> 2:14:40.920]  and I can't listen he goes on to say he trusts him and Bill Gates or everything the
[2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:45.640]  clips on him for worse I can't listen anymore of it Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you
[2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:49.720]  Bill Gates pays no taxes Bill Gates does everything tax exempt Bill Gates is a criminal
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:57.880]  who's a censor an anti-american in pro-communist China and we're being told he should run our
[2:14:57.880 --> 2:15:02.040]  lives that's what Tedros goes on to say I just can't listen anymore of it now here's the bank of
[2:15:02.040 --> 2:15:08.360]  England well we can't we don't have time for it I'll play when you come back admitting what's the
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:20.680]  term they use bank of England chief warns over quote apocalyptic food prices because of the lockdowns
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:25.960]  so they trigger all this they're going to flood the first world the refugees and then poses a
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:32.120]  savior and talk about the big heart he also talked about the big heart of Bono that raises
[2:15:32.120 --> 2:15:39.320]  billions off helping Africa and gives 1 1.1 percent it's a disgusting scum like the most
[2:15:39.320 --> 2:15:46.120]  sociopathic psychotic people on earth and they're just up there betting on us being ignorant
[2:15:46.120 --> 2:15:51.720]  betting on us not being aware of who they are well we're awake Tedros so look out

[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:10.920]  big casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the

[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:26.440]  spend most of my time in meetings people think i spent most of my time walking out of meetings i
[2:21:26.440 --> 2:21:31.960]  didn't actually hurt anyone only when the russian finance minister came on but um i have to tell you
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:38.040]  that i mean i think this is very this is a big concern because i think two things that the ukrainian
[2:21:38.040 --> 2:21:43.960]  finance minister said one is ukraine does have food in in in store but it can't get it out at the
[2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:51.000]  moment to what he was optimistic about crop planting you know as you know ukraine is a major
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:22:01.160]  supplier of of wheat major supplier of um oil at the kukians and he said you know he was pretty
[2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:05.320]  optimistic about planting interestingly but he said at the moment you know we have no way of
[2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:11.640]  shipping it out as things don't want it's getting worse and that is a major major worry and it's
[2:22:11.640 --> 2:22:15.480]  not just i have to tell you a major worry for this country it is a major worry for the developing
[2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:20.760]  world as well and and so if i have to sort of sorry for being apocalyptic for a moment um but
[2:22:20.760 --> 2:22:29.720]  that is uh that's a major concern apocalyptic apocalyptic says the head of the bank of england
[2:22:29.720 --> 2:22:37.240]  but did you hear that the lockdowns caused it oh no it's russia it's ukraine when that's just a
[2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:46.120]  cherry on top and australia and other countries say we're going to sign on this un treaty but
[2:22:46.120 --> 2:22:52.520]  they won't even release the treaty but they tell us what the treaty is and it's a worldwide corporate
[2:22:52.520 --> 2:23:01.480]  technocracy and that's what we're discussing here on this thursday may 19th broadcast
[2:23:03.160 --> 2:23:10.680]  i'm going to hit more news now there's a lot of it to get to but i just want to illustrate that
[2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:16.840]  what we're dealing with here are individuals and groups
[2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:27.160]  groups that are fundamentally hateful and that are fundamentally ruthless and who at a base level
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:35.000]  hate everybody including their own families and that's why they tell you all day america is racist
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:40.760]  and bad is because the idea of america which was never fully implemented but partially implemented
[2:23:40.760 --> 2:23:45.880]  was so great compared to every other system that they can't deal with it they can't compete with it
[2:23:45.880 --> 2:23:53.720]  they don't know how to respond to a system where hey i'm i'm confident in myself i'm confident in
[2:23:53.720 --> 2:23:58.360]  my abilities and and i think if you're confident and you're smart and you build a great business or
[2:23:58.360 --> 2:24:04.280]  a great invention or make great food or a great farmer or a great teacher a great artist a great
[2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:11.560]  pastor a great leader that your wealth increases my wealth i mean i know that's how wealth works
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:16.760]  everybody knows that so why are they setting up a system where they cut off the carbon
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:23.000]  and cut off the wealth it's because they can't compete with you ladies and gentlemen the pastor
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:26.920]  spell last hour read an and ran quote was really powerful that i remember reading many years ago
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:34.280]  had red scents that we should probably try to find later and play a clip of on air because i can't
[2:24:34.280 --> 2:24:44.680]  quote the whole thing just from memory but when those that don't produce are pointing their
[2:24:44.680 --> 2:24:51.880]  finger at people that do produce and trying to guilt us into submission to them you know you
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:25:00.040]  are in a very bad situation and that's really what we do here is we raise the alarm and we try
[2:25:00.040 --> 2:25:06.280]  to convince people from a historic and economic and cultural and religious spiritual perspective
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:13.480]  that the only thing you can lose at is not taking action the only way you lose
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:20.280]  is not by being engaged now you can reverse that and say well the 1983 movie war games what a strange
[2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:28.040]  game what a strange game the only way to win is not to play yes exactly we shouldn't play in the
[2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:40.840]  violence we shouldn't play in the riots but we should be fully totally absolutely engaged
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:49.880]  every day challenging the lies of the corporate media and the good news is we've kicked their
[2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:56.520]  butts the good news is they're dead politically no one's buying what they're doing but they're
[2:25:56.520 --> 2:26:02.440]  still in control so what do you do if you're in control of the finances and the infrastructure
[2:26:02.440 --> 2:26:07.080]  but everybody hates you do you give up do you go away do you reform yourself well that's the smart
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:16.200]  thing to do you become a human no they don't do that they double and triple and quadruple and
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:23.720]  quintuple down and then they do it again and so that's why we're in such a dangerous position
[2:26:23.720 --> 2:26:29.480]  i'm just going to say this now to the listeners and i really mean this for my fundamental core
[2:26:30.600 --> 2:26:35.000]  i know the power of the individual reaching out and working with other individuals because all
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:42.200]  of our great successes has been a collective success with all of you but beautiful souls
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:49.000]  individuals working together for that change that is what you did and i never know if it's
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:52.120]  my last broadcast one of the things that are going on this country in the world i think you
[2:26:52.120 --> 2:26:59.080]  understand that and that's why i want to take time out again with all the news and all the clips
[2:26:59.080 --> 2:27:03.240]  and all things i've got to cover i only covered like a third of the news i don't say this because
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:13.800]  i'm lacking time or i got too much time i say it because it's so real you know who you are
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:19.320]  that have spoke up for enforce you know who you are that have prayed for this operation
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:25.560]  you know who you are that have bought products and made donations and i want to thank those of
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:33.560]  you that have done that particularly in the last month as i gave it to god and i said god i can't
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:39.000]  keep my product in the future to fund our operation do i just spend the money we got tell the audience
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:45.880]  we're gonna shut down in nine ten months twelve months maximum and do i just let people know
[2:27:45.880 --> 2:27:53.160]  we've run our course but i don't believe we've run our course and i just had amazing internal
[2:27:55.640 --> 2:28:02.520]  confidence at my core that god does not want this fight to stop and god does not want info wars
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:07.000]  to be a relic of the past though what we've said and done is going to be powerful in the future
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:13.880]  but god has our most important work to happen currently in the present and into the future
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:21.480]  and in the past because without a band on video they will flush all the previous shows we predicted
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:28.760]  everything on that has such an awakening effect and so it's our past work now being presented in
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:34.120]  the current in the future that is really the most important and it is all of you and your support
[2:28:34.760 --> 2:28:38.840]  to pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars of bandwidth a month that have allowed this new
[2:28:38.840 --> 2:28:44.200]  great awakening to happen and so you can look at the mirror tonight you look at the mirror right now

[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:33.120]  Park at the moan
[2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:36.120]  Park at the moan
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:40.120]  All right, my friends, let's continue all to the news
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:46.120]  All right, look, I've got to get through all these clips because I was watching these last time this morning
[2:34:46.120 --> 2:34:48.120]  and they just got to be seen
[2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:53.120]  and I've got two clips, TV viewers will be able to see these radio posters, I'll describe them for you
[2:34:53.120 --> 2:34:56.120]  that are also on infowars.com that are just
[2:34:58.120 --> 2:35:01.120]  just so illustrative
[2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:03.120]  and
[2:35:03.120 --> 2:35:06.120]  Documentary of everything we're talking about
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:11.120]  Obviously, China under Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Carnegie, CIA control
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:14.120]  26, 7 months ago, did the big fair mongering
[2:35:14.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  all the theater, the people being welded in their houses, the people being taken to camps
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:20.120]  to set the precedent of this is how you respond
[2:35:20.120 --> 2:35:24.120]  and now the UN trees coming in that codifies that into world law
[2:35:24.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  But we got new clips, this is on the Chinese news, they're very proud of this
[2:35:35.120 --> 2:35:39.120]  of 18-wheeler-sized fire trucks
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  we'll roll the b-roll now
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:52.120]  driving down the streets in major cities spring disinfectant on the streets in the middle of high noon
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:57.120]  Now, why is that so important?
[2:35:57.120 --> 2:36:03.120]  Well, any virus, particularly coronavirus is very weak, dies in about three seconds in direct sunlight
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:09.120]  indoors, in water droplets, it can live about two minutes, you look those studies up
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:29.120]  It is a known fact that within two to three seconds of sunlight, the COVID-19 virus and all its variants, like vampires in high noon, are fried
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:35.120]  Just like you lay out the sun for 30 minutes when you get out of tan, you get burned
[2:36:35.120 --> 2:36:40.120]  It kills them in seconds, they have lockdown cities
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:46.120]  40 million people in just one city alone, 30 million in another, 400 million total
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:54.120]  and they've got giant bus-sized fire trucks driving around spraying the street
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:59.120]  and they have people to go down the street and spray disinfectant in the air, all theater
[2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:04.120]  while everyone is locked up inside their giant coffin apartments
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:11.120]  Now, some people for six weeks, mass suicide death, a giant exercise in martial law
[2:37:11.120 --> 2:37:17.120]  and people that have been welded in and stockaded in to these gulags, here's an image video
[2:37:17.120 --> 2:37:26.120]  of people with rope ladders escaping to get food after almost six weeks inside the buildings
[2:37:26.120 --> 2:37:35.120]  while the government drives around and people in bunny suits spraying disinfectant on the streets
[2:37:35.120 --> 2:37:44.120]  as if there's a virus there, all for show, all an exercise of insanity
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:48.120]  and then we have the numbers I covered earlier
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:59.120]  New Zealand, Israel, all the highest vaccinated places have the highest rates of death, illness, hospitalization, you name it
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:04.120]  We know exactly what's going on
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:11.120]  and so you've got to ask yourself, with the behavioral psychology, what is the point of that
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  with fire trucks driving around spraying soap disinfectant on the roads while everyone's locked down
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:24.120]  there's not a person on the street
[2:38:24.120 --> 2:38:31.120]  It's mass insanity, it's communism
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:37.120]  It's a giant open-air lunatic asylum
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:44.120]  is the communist Chinese dictator getting their population ready for
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:55.120]  Why do they have giant robot drones flying around spraying chemicals into the air?
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:39:03.120]  You want an image of dystopia, you want an image of what's coming here
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:10.120]  China is hallmarking itself, China is signaling to the WEF, the Debo script
[2:39:10.120 --> 2:39:17.120]  that they are ready to implement the total tyranny now
[2:39:17.120 --> 2:39:25.120]  The images of them hog-tying people with electrical tape and taking them away because they're not submitting
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  all through the social credit score because they didn't behave themselves
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  How would the Chinese government roll out and arrest and kill millions of its opposition?
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:40.120]  Well, the uniform is the white lab coat, it is the white bunny suit
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:44.120]  and the mask covering the face, whether you're stealing an election, it's 2,000 mules
[2:39:44.120 --> 2:39:48.120]  or whether you're taking somebody to a death camp, whether their organs will be harvested
[2:39:48.120 --> 2:39:57.120]  It's all being done as an exercise to see will the population go along with their own extermination
[2:39:57.120 --> 2:40:01.120]  And that's where we are
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  And you have to understand, the whole blueprint was co-written by the Debo script
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:16.120]  by Bill Gates, by the CIA, Carnegie Endowment, look it up, by the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:24.120]  And you got to ask yourself, where is this going to end?
[2:40:24.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  How is this going to end?
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:33.120]  And the answer is in sheer madness
[2:40:33.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  as the Communist Chinese prepare to invade and take over Taiwan
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:44.120]  as they've already taken over Hong Kong
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:52.120]  and as they become an example to the world of how to live under this abject tyranny
[2:40:52.120 --> 2:40:56.120]  So when Prince Charles says with the global military operation
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:41:02.120]  a global Marshall plan, the biggest thing in the world to save the earth from carbon
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:10.120]  Well, have you looked at yourself? Have you gone and looked up what you're made up out of?
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:13.120]  You're made out of carbon
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  You are carbon
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:24.120]  And war, biomedical world government depopulation tyranny has been declared on you
[2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  And have you ever wondered, if you hadn't seen the film Endgame or hadn't researched what we've covered
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:32.120]  Have you ever wondered how they'd do it? How they'd roll out a world ID?
[2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:34.120]  How they'd roll out disappearing people to camps?
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:38.120]  How they'd roll out robots flying around the sky and spraying chemicals everywhere?
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:41.120]  How would they do it? And you now know how they'd do it
[2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:45.120]  And what did Prince Charles say? I played the clip at the start of the hour
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.120]  If you don't give in to world government, more viruses will come out of the jungle and kill you
[2:41:49.120 --> 2:41:54.120]  He's saying, submit to us, let us lock you down and then the viruses won't kill you anymore
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:59.120]  But we know that this was a beta test and that once we allow them to lock everything down
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:06.120]  They are going to drop the proverbial hammer on our heads
[2:42:06.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  When we come back, the latest in Ukraine, the latest on Biden and what he has planned
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:19.120]  The midterms, the latest on Governor DeSantis and so much more
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:25.120]  And then we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson from England hosting the fourth hour today
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:30.120]  And then at three o'clock central time in an hour and seventeen and a half minutes
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:34.120]  Owen Schreuer will take over the war room and every day we're on air as precious
[2:42:34.120 --> 2:42:38.120]  Every day we're able to tell the truth as precious, every day you send new people here
[2:42:38.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  To find out what's really happening, to understand the big end game is precious
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:46.120]  And that's why I'm very honored and blessed to be here with you
[2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:52.120]  And very thankful to all of you because our job is to become very easy
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:43:19.120]  Because it's about to all get right out in the open
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:28.120]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find
[2:43:28.120 --> 2:43:32.120]  Most of the iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:35.120]  So you don't absorb it at all or fully
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:39.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply and it's been sold out for months
[2:43:39.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  Because supply chain break downs, but despite that we're selling it at twenty-five percent off
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:46.120]  For one more week and it goes back to full price
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  Within two weeks the current sales rate is going to sell out

[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:30.120]  I pay a price, I really do
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:33.120]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  I can run ten miles, I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:44.120]  And my friends will attest to the fact that for a guy in his sixties pushing seventy
[2:44:44.120 --> 2:44:48.120]  And I'm not just blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last twenty-five years
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:04.120]  And we have some of those original designs still for sale at infowarstore.com
[2:45:04.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  These are real classics

[2:45:08.120 --> 2:45:10.120]  Because we're selling out of them
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:12.120]  They're about to be history
[2:45:12.120 --> 2:45:15.120]  And we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts
[2:45:15.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  All these amazing designs at costinfowarstore.com
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:20.120]  Except for this fundraiser shirt
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:22.120]  That is a real hit and people love it
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  It's $24.95
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  Alex Jones is right on the front
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:25.120]  The Red Thunderbolt
[2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:27.120]  And then again on the back
[2:45:27.120 --> 2:45:29.120]  A big bold infowarstore.com

[2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:36.120]  And fund the infowar at the same time
[2:45:36.120 --> 2:45:39.120]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:42.120]  That sends a stronger message of freedom resistance to the new world order
[2:45:42.120 --> 2:45:44.120]  Than the Alex Jones was right shirt
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:47.120]  Exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:50.120]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well

[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:44.120]  That want to support freedom to take action now
[2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:46.120]  And be part of the global awakening
[2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:49.120]  The new renaissance that's counter the great reset
[2:46:49.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  By going to infowarstore.com
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  And clicking on the donate button and giving today
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:55.120]  Thank you so much for your support
[2:46:55.120 --> 2:46:58.120]  Please take action
[2:46:58.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:03.120]  Of the new world order
[2:47:03.120 --> 2:47:07.120]  It's Alex Jones
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:26.120]  I think it's going to be, I mean I'm seeing it like close to $5 even in some parts of Florida
[2:47:26.120 --> 2:47:29.120]  It was probably about 415 just a couple weeks ago
[2:47:29.120 --> 2:47:31.120]  So it's going up
[2:47:31.120 --> 2:47:35.120]  And you know they're not doing energy in the United States
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.120]  Now they said they want to get oil from Maduro
[2:47:39.120 --> 2:47:40.120]  In Venezuela
[2:47:40.120 --> 2:47:43.120]  Which all that's going to do is just line his pockets
[2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  And actually it'll help Russia
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:47.120]  They're always talking about Russia and Putin
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:50.120]  Well they have a very close relationship with Maduro and Putin
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:52.120]  And so they're doing that
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:53.120]  They'll vet OPEC
[2:47:53.120 --> 2:47:57.120]  But they will not do more energy in the United States
[2:47:57.120 --> 2:48:01.120]  And the result is that they really reduce our ability
[2:48:01.120 --> 2:48:04.120]  To be energy independent and produce our own energy
[2:48:04.120 --> 2:48:08.120]  They're canceling oil and gas leases in places like Alaska
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:12.120]  And the people that have to fill out their gas tanks
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:15.120]  Are the ones that are paying the price for those bad policies
[2:48:15.120 --> 2:48:19.120]  And so I think what Elon Musk said the other day about
[2:48:19.120 --> 2:48:22.120]  Whoever puts that stuff into the teleprompter
[2:48:22.120 --> 2:48:25.120]  Is kind of who the president is because you just never know
[2:48:25.120 --> 2:48:28.120]  But this is a huge failure
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:30.120]  And it's really difficult for a lot of people
[2:48:30.120 --> 2:48:33.120]  And we have not even hit summer driving season yet
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:35.120]  So I think you're going to see it
[2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:37.120]  Unless they reverse force
[2:48:37.120 --> 2:48:40.120]  You're going to see it over $5 a gallon for unleaded
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  And in places like California
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:44.120]  They're going to pay like $7 or $8
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:46.120]  Because of all those taxes they have
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:49.120]  So you caught the problem with what DeSantis said
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:51.120]  Right, he's a good guy, I like him
[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:55.120]  Oh, it's bad policy, they don't know what they're doing
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:48:57.120]  It's being reported
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  That they're programming Oregon gas pumps
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  At $10 a gallon now, that's in the news
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  So they're getting you ready for that
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:09.120]  Now something DeSantis said that was totally true
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:12.120]  Was that Biden should get an honorary membership
[2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:15.120]  In the drug cartels for what he's done on the southern border
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:16.120]  Here it is
[2:49:16.120 --> 2:49:19.120]  Border communities are just getting killed down in southern Texas
[2:49:19.120 --> 2:49:21.120]  With everything coming in
[2:49:21.120 --> 2:49:24.120]  And honestly he should be, Biden should be
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  Given an honorary membership in the Mexican drug cartels
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  Because nobody has done more to help the cartels
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:34.120]  Than Biden with his open border policies
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  And so it's a total disaster
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:40.120]  It's been a disaster, I fear, with Title 42
[2:49:40.120 --> 2:49:44.120]  If they do repeal it, I think things are fixing to get even worse
[2:49:44.120 --> 2:49:48.120]  But it's a disaster that was planned
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  And every senator and house member that's decent
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:54.120]  Like DeSantis keeps saying, oh, they're idiots
[2:49:54.120 --> 2:49:58.120]  The left doesn't know, no, this is an exact plan
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:01.120]  To collapse the third world, flood the first world
[2:50:01.120 --> 2:50:04.120]  Ship in all the fentanyl, all of this is a formula
[2:50:04.120 --> 2:50:09.120]  Of George Soros and the New World Order
[2:50:09.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  So I want to commend all the listeners
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.120]  And you know who you are that have supported us
[2:50:14.120 --> 2:50:17.120]  And donated and bought products at inforwarsport.com
[2:50:17.120 --> 2:50:20.120]  Because we're toe-to-toe with Soros
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.120]  We're toe-to-toe with the New World Order
[2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:24.120]  Most people are scared to do it, I'm scared to not fight it
[2:50:24.120 --> 2:50:26.120]  Because I realize what they're taking us
[2:50:26.120 --> 2:50:28.120]  And because of you, we're still on air
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.120]  So you know who you are, those that have been donating
[2:50:30.120 --> 2:50:33.120]  I want to thank you so much for what you've done
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:37.120]  Because I have a great crew
[2:50:37.120 --> 2:50:41.120]  And we're doing a lot of research, a lot of ways to fund things around here
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:44.120]  And a lot of ways to cut costs
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:50:49.120]  And nobody told me
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:52.120]  We were three months behind on our bandwidth bills
[2:50:52.120 --> 2:50:54.120]  Because the money wasn't there
[2:50:54.120 --> 2:50:59.120]  And I said, well, we have that Bitcoin somebody gave us
[2:50:59.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  We already cashed half of it in
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:03.120]  I was trying to wait until it went back up, but that will pay the bill
[2:51:03.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  And I was like, tell me, because I don't want to be on payment plans
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:08.120]  With the people's support
[2:51:08.120 --> 2:51:11.120]  And that's how close down the line we were
[2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:13.120]  But your donations and your support
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  And what you've done has kept us on air, so I thank you
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:17.120]  Now a lot of people sent me this
[2:51:17.120 --> 2:51:19.120]  It was trending, I guess, two days ago on Twitter
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:20.120]  I didn't see that
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:22.120]  I got sent screenshots of it
[2:51:22.120 --> 2:51:23.120]  But Alex Jones was right
[2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:24.120]  It was trending again
[2:51:24.120 --> 2:51:26.120]  There was skyriding it over LA with five airplanes
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  It was amazing
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:32.120]  But what was trending was this big study
[2:51:32.120 --> 2:51:35.120]  They got studies in the U.S.
[2:51:35.120 --> 2:51:36.120]  They got studies in Africa
[2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:37.120]  They got studies in Asia
[2:51:37.120 --> 2:51:41.120]  They got studies in Latin America, Central, South America
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  And just a little bit of atrazine creates total feminization of male frogs
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:49.120]  And then they're attracted to the same sex
[2:51:49.120 --> 2:51:51.120]  And the media makes jokes
[2:51:51.120 --> 2:51:53.120]  Oh, well, gay frogs are cute, why are you against them?
[2:51:56.120 --> 2:51:59.120]  It's because they die, they go extinct
[2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.120]  I guess the left's going to tell us there's too many frogs now
[2:52:03.120 --> 2:52:05.120]  Because they're carbon-based
[2:52:05.120 --> 2:52:08.120]  So the frogs are a canary in the coal mine
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:11.120]  They are an example of where we are
[2:52:11.120 --> 2:52:13.120]  Here's a big study
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:16.120]  Atrazine induces complete feminization
[2:52:16.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  And chemical castration in male African clawed frogs
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:23.120]  And, again, these studies have been out for a while
[2:52:23.120 --> 2:52:25.120]  There's new studies out on it
[2:52:25.120 --> 2:52:29.120]  And it shows what it does
[2:52:29.120 --> 2:52:31.120]  We got Berkeley studies
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:33.120]  We got studies out of Toronto
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:35.120]  We got studies out of South Africa
[2:52:35.120 --> 2:52:38.120]  We got studies out of South Africa
[2:52:38.120 --> 2:52:41.120]  We've got it all, ladies and gentlemen
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:44.120]  And it does this to humans as well
[2:52:44.120 --> 2:52:47.120]  That's why genitals, I don't care if you're black or white
[2:52:47.120 --> 2:52:51.120]  Are a third the size they were of a 1960s male
[2:52:53.120 --> 2:52:55.120]  So the media makes jokes about that
[2:52:55.120 --> 2:52:57.120]  A few months ago when I gave the example of
[2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:00.120]  If your daddy's Johnson was a foot long, yours was six inches long
[2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:03.120]  And if yours was six inches, your son will be three inches
[2:53:03.120 --> 2:53:05.120]  And the one who won't even have a penis
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:08.120]  So we can make jokes about that all day long
[2:53:08.120 --> 2:53:12.120]  But this isn't a game
[2:53:12.120 --> 2:53:15.120]  And you can say, okay, well, who cares?
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:17.120]  Well, we're sterilized
[2:53:17.120 --> 2:53:22.120]  And the sperm counts are down 96% in North America
[2:53:22.120 --> 2:53:25.120]  Now, thank God designed us with millions of sperm each time
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:28.120]  So there's still some get in there
[2:53:28.120 --> 2:53:32.120]  But you wonder about the autism and the cancer rates
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:35.120]  And all of it, that's what's going on here
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:38.120]  And they had all these other chemicals they could put in the fuel
[2:53:38.120 --> 2:53:41.120]  But they choose atrazine
[2:53:41.120 --> 2:53:44.120]  Because it specifically causes complete feminization
[2:53:44.120 --> 2:53:47.120]  And chemical castration in male African clawed frogs
[2:53:47.120 --> 2:53:50.120]  And other frogs
[2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:52.120]  And why is that? Well, the frogs live in the water
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:54.120]  The frogs have thin skin
[2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:56.120]  It gets into their bloodstream
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:54:00.120]  But it does the same thing
[2:54:00.120 --> 2:54:03.120]  To different degrees
[2:54:03.120 --> 2:54:07.120]  To every single species that this happens to
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:12.120]  And so we've had all the late night comedy shows
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:15.120]  From Colbert, to Fallon, to Kimmel
[2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:17.120]  You've seen the clips
[2:54:17.120 --> 2:54:19.120]  Say, Alex Jones is really dangerous
[2:54:19.120 --> 2:54:23.120]  He claims there's chemicals in the food and water
[2:54:23.120 --> 2:54:27.120]  He claims there's liner in the soft drink cans
[2:54:27.120 --> 2:54:30.120]  That has bisphenol A
[2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  And other chemicals in it that lower fertility
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:34.120]  But that's what the studies show
[2:54:34.120 --> 2:54:36.120]  Type into a search engine
[2:54:36.120 --> 2:54:39.120]  Plastic liners in food containers
[2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:41.120]  Causing lower sperm counts
[2:54:41.120 --> 2:54:43.120]  Causing hormonal disturbances
[2:54:43.120 --> 2:54:47.120]  Girls on average used to go into puberty at 13
[2:54:47.120 --> 2:54:51.120]  The U.S. national average is about 9
[2:54:51.120 --> 2:54:54.120]  3-year-old girls are now having periods
[2:54:54.120 --> 2:54:57.120]  3-year-old girls are now getting pregnant
[2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:00.120]  Because these chemicals
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:03.120]  Hyper-feminize females
[2:55:03.120 --> 2:55:05.120]  And feminized males
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:11.120]  And this is one of the big central issues
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:13.120]  That we're talking about
[2:55:13.120 --> 2:55:22.120]  So, out of one side of their mouth
[2:55:22.120 --> 2:55:24.120]  They're telling you it doesn't exist
[2:55:24.120 --> 2:55:26.120]  Don't look into it
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:28.120]  But out of the other side of their mouth
[2:55:28.120 --> 2:55:31.120]  They're saying, okay, it's the plastics
[2:55:31.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  Causing their infertility
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  And you can say, well, there's too many people
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:37.120]  And pretend you're part of the power structure
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:39.120]  But it gives you cancer
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:41.120]  It gives you so many other problems
[2:55:41.120 --> 2:55:48.120]  They are targeting all of us together right now
[2:55:48.120 --> 2:55:50.120]  We are being hit
[2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  By a chemical and biological attack
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:56.120]  Anyone that has survived COVID
[2:55:56.120 --> 2:55:58.120]  Or the poisoned shots
[2:55:58.120 --> 2:56:04.120]  Is a survivor of a biological, nanotech
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:10.120]  Synthetic, genetically engineered system
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:12.120]  And that's just the fact
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:16.120]  So, I don't know what you're supposed to do
[2:56:16.120 --> 2:56:18.120]  Or even what I'm supposed to do
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:21.120]  And I just feel sorry for the people
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  That lie about us and attack us
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:26.120]  And try to shut us down
[2:56:26.120 --> 2:56:28.120]  When all we're trying to do
[2:56:28.120 --> 2:56:31.120]  Is get people to start being concerned
[2:56:31.120 --> 2:56:35.120]  About the real issues that face humans on this planet
[2:56:35.120 --> 2:56:37.120]  And what's coming next if we don't
[2:56:37.120 --> 2:56:40.120]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson is scheduled to take over here
[2:56:40.120 --> 2:56:42.120]  He'll take over next segment
[2:56:42.120 --> 2:56:44.120]  And I hit a lot of the news today
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:46.120]  But there's a lot I didn't cover
[2:56:46.120 --> 2:56:48.120]  So we'll be filing some special reports
[2:56:48.120 --> 2:56:51.120]  And more at Mandel Video and infowars.com
[2:56:51.120 --> 2:56:53.120]  But this zero hedge article is very important
[2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:56.120]  By administration anticipating wave of summer violence
[2:56:56.120 --> 2:56:59.120]  Over Roe v. Wade, CNN and the Justice Department
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:04.120]  Are now reporting that the violence in the capital
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:08.120]  Is by anti-abortion advocates when none of that's true
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:11.120]  So they've deliberately turned up the temperature
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:15.120]  By announcing a leak of this draft
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  When they already had it ready over a year ago
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:21.120]  To try to change the subject in the election
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:24.120]  Away from inflation, open borders, world government
[2:57:24.120 --> 2:57:27.120]  On to abortion just as a distraction
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:28.120]  I don't think abortion is a distraction
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  I'm saying they're using it as a distraction
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:34.120]  Alright, the war room is in T-minus 62 minutes
[2:57:34.120 --> 2:57:36.120]  We're gonna go to break in the fourth hour
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:38.120]  Paul Watson always kicks ass
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:40.120]  He takes over, infowars.com

[3:00:12.120 --> 3:00:22.120]  Transmuting worldwide from the summit.newstudios in the United Kingdom
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:26.120]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:30.120]  You're live, it is the Summit News Hour
[3:00:30.120 --> 3:00:33.120]  On this 19th of May 2022
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:37.120]  Huge raft of subjects coming up over the next hour
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:43.120]  Of course, big in the news is the fact that the queen of dissidents has been dethroned
[3:00:43.120 --> 3:00:48.120]  Big sis is big sad, that is of course the would be leader
[3:00:48.120 --> 3:00:52.120]  Of the Department of Homeland Security's Ministry of Truth
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:56.120]  Having to be wrapped up, suspended, kiboshed basically
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:01.120]  Because they claim a coordinated right wing disinformation campaign
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:05.120]  Really, we'll see what is actually going on with that
[3:01:05.120 --> 3:01:08.120]  We've also got Twitter introducing a new policy
[3:01:08.120 --> 3:01:12.120]  During what they call crisis situations
[3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:17.120]  Which is basically if a transgender gets called a man on Twitter
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:19.120]  That's a crisis situation in their eyes
[3:01:19.120 --> 3:01:23.120]  Saying that they're going to slap more warning labels
[3:01:23.120 --> 3:01:25.120]  More censorship on tweets
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:29.120]  The woke employees, some of whom are being fired right now
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:31.120]  Are really trying to get their digs in
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:35.120]  Before a potential takeover by Elon Musk
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.120]  The fallout from the Buffalo shooting continues
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.120]  With New York Governor Kathy Hodgell
[3:01:40.120 --> 3:01:43.120]  Announcing that they're going to create a new police unit
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:45.120]  To combat quote hate speech
[3:01:45.120 --> 3:01:48.120]  Which as we know is basically thought crime
[3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:52.120]  But in the UK, we have a top cop who says that
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:56.120]  Because the lowest ever proportion of actual crimes are being solved
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:02:01.120]  They should stop focusing on speech offenses
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:04.120]  We're also going to talk about a CDC study
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:06.120]  Or a new set of figures released
[3:02:06.120 --> 3:02:09.120]  Where they say they're investigating in the United States
[3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:14.120]  180 cases of children with hepatitis of unknown cause
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.120]  It's a total mystery
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:19.120]  Despite the fact that it's happening worldwide
[3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  It's happening in the UK
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:24.120]  And top health experts in the UK
[3:02:24.120 --> 3:02:28.120]  Have said precisely what has caused it
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:31.120]  And we'll go on to talk about what has caused it
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:35.120]  The mainstream media, legacy media in the United States
[3:02:35.120 --> 3:02:37.120]  Aren't even mentioning
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:40.120]  Meanwhile, the WHO is to make lockdowns
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:42.120]  Part of its official pandemic guidance
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:44.120]  Despite the fact that there's voluminous evidence
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:47.120]  That lockdowns have been an absolute disaster
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:51.120]  Major studies attesting to that fact
[3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:55.120]  We also have a TV presenter in the UK
[3:02:55.120 --> 3:02:59.120]  Saying that food shortages will lead to cannibalism
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:03.120]  And he was only half joking when he made that prediction
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  Of course, massive global wheat shortages
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:10.120]  We have top Russian officials now warning of a global famine
[3:03:10.120 --> 3:03:12.120]  Likely to happen this year
[3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:16.120]  Because basically of the world's support for the current thing
[3:03:16.120 --> 3:03:20.120]  Joe Biden's failed to comment on one mass shooting
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:22.120]  That occurred in America last weekend
[3:03:22.120 --> 3:03:24.120]  In addition to the buffalo shooting
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:26.120]  Because it didn't fit the narrative
[3:03:26.120 --> 3:03:28.120]  We're going to get into that
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:32.120]  And the LGBT flag, if you could believe this was
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:34.120]  Physically possible
[3:03:34.120 --> 3:03:37.120]  Is now adding more colours
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:39.120]  Yeah, if you didn't think it was an ugly mess
[3:03:39.120 --> 3:03:41.120]  To begin with
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:44.120]  A vomit of rainbows basically
[3:03:44.120 --> 3:03:49.120]  Now it's going to be even more complex
[3:03:49.120 --> 3:03:52.120]  To satiate another extreme minority group
[3:03:52.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  Meanwhile, Disney announces LGBT clothing line for children
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:03:59.120]  Apparently their complete collapse in favourability
[3:03:59.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  Isn't deterring them from satiating the woke mob
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  We have a criminal, a dangerous thought criminal
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:13.120]  Who put tire marks on an LGBT crosswalk in Canada
[3:04:13.120 --> 3:04:15.120]  We're actually in Florida
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:21.120]  Now being ordered by a judge to write 25 pages of LGBT fiction
[3:04:21.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  Yes, his thought crime will be punished
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:30.120]  With re-education on how this oppressed minority group
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:32.120]  Is really so downtrodden
[3:04:32.120 --> 3:04:35.120]  Despite the fact that literally every major corporation
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:38.120]  Every major government, the judicial system

[3:06:23.120 --> 3:06:26.120]  We have this headline out Summit.News
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:30.120]  CDC now investigating 180 cases of children
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:33.120]  With hepatitis of unknown cause
[3:06:33.120 --> 3:06:35.120]  It's a complete mystery to them
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:38.120]  CDC is now investigating 180 cases of children
[3:06:38.120 --> 3:06:40.120]  With hepatitis of an unknown cause
[3:06:40.120 --> 3:06:42.120]  Although health experts in the UK
[3:06:42.120 --> 3:06:44.120]  Know what the cause is
[3:06:44.120 --> 3:06:47.120]  And they've already basically said what it is
[3:06:47.120 --> 3:06:51.120]  Yet the CBC reported, or CNBC sorry
[3:06:51.120 --> 3:06:53.120]  That they just have no clue
[3:06:53.120 --> 3:06:56.120]  Why there's this sudden spate of hepatitis cases
[3:06:56.120 --> 3:06:58.120]  Not just in the United States
[3:06:58.120 --> 3:06:59.120]  But across the world
[3:06:59.120 --> 3:07:03.120]  Where kids are having to have urgent organ transplants
[3:07:03.120 --> 3:07:05.120]  Kids in Ireland have died
[3:07:05.120 --> 3:07:08.120]  There have been five deaths in the United States so far
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  And they're just holding their hands up
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:12.120]  And saying we don't know why this is happening
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:14.120]  They reported quote
[3:07:14.120 --> 3:07:16.120]  Adenovirus infection is being investigated
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:18.120]  As being the possible cause
[3:07:18.120 --> 3:07:22.120]  With nearly half the kids testing positive for the pathogen
[3:07:22.120 --> 3:07:24.120]  Now what they don't tell you
[3:07:24.120 --> 3:07:27.120]  Is that adenoviruses normally
[3:07:27.120 --> 3:07:30.120]  Lead to causing the common cold
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:34.120]  But because kids have weakened immune systems
[3:07:34.120 --> 3:07:35.120]  Because of lockdown
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:37.120]  They're unable to fight it off
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:39.120]  And then it gets worse
[3:07:39.120 --> 3:07:42.120]  And it becomes the hepatitis infection
[3:07:42.120 --> 3:07:45.120]  That's the reason why there are hepatitis cases
[3:07:45.120 --> 3:07:49.120]  In children now exploding all over the world
[3:07:49.120 --> 3:07:52.120]  And people, experts in the UK have said that
[3:07:52.120 --> 3:07:54.120]  Yet there's no mention of it
[3:07:54.120 --> 3:07:57.120]  Throughout this entire CNBC article
[3:07:57.120 --> 3:08:00.120]  Or in any of the other legacy media articles
[3:08:00.120 --> 3:08:02.120]  That I saw yesterday
[3:08:02.120 --> 3:08:05.120]  Professor Simon Taylor Robinson said
[3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:07.120]  I think it's likely that children mixing
[3:08:07.120 --> 3:08:09.120]  In kindergartens and schools
[3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:12.120]  Have lower immunity to seasonal adenoviruses
[3:08:12.120 --> 3:08:14.120]  Than in previous years
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:17.120]  Because of restrictions
[3:08:17.120 --> 3:08:19.120]  In other words, because of lockdown
[3:08:19.120 --> 3:08:21.120]  Because these kids have not been socialized
[3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:23.120]  They've not been around other kids enough
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:26.120]  The mask wearing is also played a part
[3:08:26.120 --> 3:08:29.120]  Their immune systems are basically short
[3:08:29.120 --> 3:08:33.120]  Whether the vaccines have any additional impact
[3:08:33.120 --> 3:08:36.120]  In terms of crippling their immune systems
[3:08:36.120 --> 3:08:38.120]  Is certainly up for debate
[3:08:38.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  But there's no debate that lockdown has weakened
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:42.120]  Children's immune systems
[3:08:42.120 --> 3:08:47.120]  And made them more prone to all these other viruses
[3:08:47.120 --> 3:08:49.120]  The professor went on to say, quote
[3:08:49.120 --> 3:08:51.120]  This means they could be more at risk
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:54.120]  Of developing hepatitis because their immune response
[3:08:54.120 --> 3:08:57.120]  Is weaker to the virus
[3:08:57.120 --> 3:09:00.120]  Because of this absolute hysterical panic
[3:09:00.120 --> 3:09:02.120]  About keeping kids away from each other
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:06.120]  Despite the fact, for example, in the UK
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:10.120]  Even during the height of the coronavirus pandemic
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:12.120]  Children under the age of 15
[3:09:12.120 --> 3:09:14.120]  Were more likely to be killed
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:17.120]  By falling over, putting their pants on
[3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:20.120]  Than from COVID-19 virus itself
[3:09:20.120 --> 3:09:22.120]  But now they are at risk
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:25.120]  For all these other horrible viruses
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:27.120]  Now, in this CNBC article
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:29.120]  Which completely failed to mention
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:31.120]  That health experts in the UK have already explained this
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:34.120]  Is due to lockdowns that they supported
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:38.120]  They said the CDC is still conducting lab tests
[3:09:38.120 --> 3:09:40.120]  To see if the COVID virus
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:42.120]  Might also be a possible cause
[3:09:42.120 --> 3:09:44.120]  Every time there's a new outbreak
[3:09:44.120 --> 3:09:47.120]  Of some weird virus that they can't explain
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:50.120]  They always blame it on COVID itself
[3:09:50.120 --> 3:09:53.120]  Despite the fact that the children impacted
[3:09:53.120 --> 3:09:55.120]  In the initial cluster of cases in Alabama
[3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:57.120]  In this hepatitis outbreak
[3:09:57.120 --> 3:09:59.120]  Did not have COVID-19
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:01.120]  So they're studying the wrong thing
[3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:04.120]  They should be studying the drastic consequences
[3:10:04.120 --> 3:10:06.120]  Of lockdown
[3:10:06.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  And again, it's not just physical health
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:10.120]  It's mental health
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:12.120]  We had an article last week
[3:10:12.120 --> 3:10:15.120]  Where the Royal Society Open Science Journal
[3:10:15.120 --> 3:10:17.120]  Found that lockdowns in the UK
[3:10:17.120 --> 3:10:20.120]  Caused around 60,000 children
[3:10:20.120 --> 3:10:22.120]  To suffer clinical depression
[3:10:22.120 --> 3:10:24.120]  And of course, those are only the numbers
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:26.120]  Who are being vocal about it
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:28.120]  Who are going to doctors, therapists
[3:10:28.120 --> 3:10:29.120]  Getting treatment for it
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:32.120]  The actual number is probably far higher
[3:10:32.120 --> 3:10:34.120]  We featured before
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:37.120]  A prominent study by Johns Hopkins University
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:39.120]  Concluding that global lockdowns
[3:10:39.120 --> 3:10:42.120]  Have had a much more detrimental impact on society
[3:10:42.120 --> 3:10:44.120]  Than they've produced any benefit
[3:10:44.120 --> 3:10:46.120]  With researchers urging there are ill-founded
[3:10:46.120 --> 3:10:47.120]  And should be rejected
[3:10:47.120 --> 3:10:50.120]  As a pandemic policy instrument
[3:10:50.120 --> 3:10:53.120]  Yet what is the WHO out doing today?
[3:10:53.120 --> 3:10:56.120]  Making lockdowns part of official
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:10:58.120]  Pandemic guidance
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:01.120]  Again, despite the fact that Sweden
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:04.120]  Did not impose any strict lockdown measures
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:07.120]  Or mask mandates at any step of the way
[3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:10.120]  And their mortality rate per capita
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:12.120]  Was one of the lowest in Europe
[3:11:12.120 --> 3:11:14.120]  What they did worked
[3:11:14.120 --> 3:11:15.120]  And everyone ignored it
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:18.120]  Because the technocrats need that power
[3:11:18.120 --> 3:11:21.120]  They need that precedent to lock us down again
[3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:22.120]  Who knows what they're going to do
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:24.120]  With this monkeypox thing?
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:26.120]  Again, despite the fact that it's
[3:11:26.120 --> 3:11:28.120]  Not very infectious at all
[3:11:28.120 --> 3:11:30.120]  The media's slowly building up
[3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:33.120]  That drumbeat of panic around monkey virus
[3:11:33.120 --> 3:11:35.120]  To probably try and get the mask mandates
[3:11:35.120 --> 3:11:36.120]  Back in place
[3:11:36.120 --> 3:11:38.120]  Despite the fact that that doesn't even
[3:11:38.120 --> 3:11:40.120]  Stop it from being transmitted
[3:11:40.120 --> 3:11:42.120]  The WHO to make lockdowns
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:44.120]  Part of official pandemic guidance
[3:11:44.120 --> 3:11:46.120]  Daily skeptic reports the World Health
[3:11:46.120 --> 3:11:48.120]  Organization is to make lockdowns
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:50.120]  And other non-pharmaceutical interventions
[3:11:50.120 --> 3:11:51.120]  Intended to curb viral spread
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:54.120]  Of the official pandemic guidance
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:11:57.120]  So again, they're taking what didn't work
[3:11:57.120 --> 3:11:59.120]  What caused disastrous consequences
[3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:01.120]  In terms of mental health, physical health
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:03.120]  The economy, poverty
[3:12:03.120 --> 3:12:04.120]  And they just said
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:06.120]  We're going to apply it once again
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:08.120]  When the next pandemic comes along
[3:12:08.120 --> 3:12:11.120]  Which Bill Gates has obviously promised
[3:12:11.120 --> 3:12:14.120]  Now I made a video about this yesterday
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:17.120]  I'm still seeing parents
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:19.120]  With baby strollers with prams
[3:12:19.120 --> 3:12:22.120]  Either the parents are still wearing masks
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:25.120]  Literally four months after all legal
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:28.120]  Mask mandates ended in England
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:30.120]  And in some cases the kids are still
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:32.120]  Wearing masks too
[3:12:32.120 --> 3:12:35.120]  Despite the known cognitive disorders
[3:12:35.120 --> 3:12:37.120]  That they're causing for a generation
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:39.120]  Of babies and toddlers
[3:12:39.120 --> 3:12:40.120]  This video is called
[3:12:40.120 --> 3:12:42.120]  They just won't stop
[3:12:42.120 --> 3:12:43.120]  Here it is
[3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:45.120]  More evidence emerging of the tremendous
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:47.120]  Damage that lockdowns and other restrictions
[3:12:47.120 --> 3:12:49.120]  Have had on the cognitive development
[3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:50.120]  Of infants
[3:12:50.120 --> 3:12:52.120]  This time it's the Royal College of
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:12:54.120]  Speech and Language Therapists
[3:12:54.120 --> 3:12:55.120]  Sounding the alarm bell
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:56.120]  The Telegraph reports
[3:12:56.120 --> 3:12:58.120]  Experts said that repeated lockdowns
[3:12:58.120 --> 3:13:00.120]  Had left young children without the chance
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:02.120]  To play and learn how to communicate
[3:13:02.120 --> 3:13:04.120]  Setting back their development
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:06.120]  Assessments show that one in five children
[3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:08.120]  Are not meeting expected standards by age
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:09.120]  Two and a half
[3:13:09.120 --> 3:13:10.120]  With thousands likely to need help
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:12.120]  Such as speech and language therapy
[3:13:12.120 --> 3:13:15.120]  A recent report by Ofsted came to a similar conclusion
[3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:17.120]  Investigators found that infants
[3:13:17.120 --> 3:13:20.120]  Who were surrounded by adults wearing face masks
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:21.120]  For much of the past two years
[3:13:21.120 --> 3:13:24.120]  Has damaged their learning and communication abilities
[3:13:24.120 --> 3:13:26.120]  Those turning two, quote, will have been
[3:13:26.120 --> 3:13:28.120]  Surrounded by adults wearing masks for their whole lives
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:30.120]  And have therefore been unable to see
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:32.120]  Lit movements or mouth shapes as regular
[3:13:32.120 --> 3:13:34.120]  The restrictions also left toddlers
[3:13:34.120 --> 3:13:36.120]  Struggling with crawling
[3:13:36.120 --> 3:13:38.120]  Using the toilet independently
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:39.120]  And making friends
[3:13:39.120 --> 3:13:42.120]  Therapists are unable to keep up with the demand
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:44.120]  They're being flooded
[3:13:44.120 --> 3:13:46.120]  With one speech therapist reporting a
[3:13:46.120 --> 3:13:49.120]  364% increase
[3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:51.120]  Inpatient referrals of babies and toddlers
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:53.120]  Jacqueline Teak says during this pandemic
[3:13:53.120 --> 3:13:55.120]  Her speech therapy clinic has seen
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:13:58.120]  An enormous shift in the ages of their patients
[3:13:58.120 --> 3:14:01.120]  Before the pandemic, only 5% of patients
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:03.120]  Were babies and toddlers
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:06.120]  Today, it has soared to 20%
[3:14:06.120 --> 3:14:09.120]  Many parents calling it COVID delayed
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:12.120]  We've seen a 364% increase
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:14.120]  In patient referrals of babies and toddlers
[3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:17.120]  From pediatricians and parents
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:19.120]  And they are children that are
[3:14:19.120 --> 3:14:20.120]  Having a difficult time speaking
[3:14:20.120 --> 3:14:21.120]  Speech delayed
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:23.120]  Babies start learning how to speak
[3:14:23.120 --> 3:14:25.120]  By reading lips as young as 8 months
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:27.120]  So what happens when lips and faces
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:29.120]  Are covered up by masks?
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:31.120]  We're seeing a lot of things that look
[3:14:31.120 --> 3:14:33.120]  Just like autism
[3:14:33.120 --> 3:14:35.120]  They're not making any word attempts
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:37.120]  And not communicating at all
[3:14:37.120 --> 3:14:38.120]  With their family
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:40.120]  Another study out of Germany found that
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:42.120]  The reading ability of children has plummeted
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:44.120]  Compared to pre-coronatimes
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:46.120]  Thanks to lockdown policies that led to
[3:14:46.120 --> 3:14:47.120]  The closure of schools
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:49.120]  And even here in England where there haven't been
[3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:51.120]  Any face mask restrictions in place for months
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:53.120]  I still see masked parents
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:14:56.120]  Walking around everywhere with toddlers and babies
[3:14:56.120 --> 3:14:58.120]  Do you think these parents would have
[3:14:58.120 --> 3:15:00.120]  At least questioned what impact
[3:15:00.120 --> 3:15:02.120]  Constantly covering their face
[3:15:02.120 --> 3:15:04.120]  Has had on their own children?
[3:15:04.120 --> 3:15:05.120]  But apparently not
[3:15:05.120 --> 3:15:07.120]  And they just won't stop
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:11.120]  And we have yet more research
[3:15:11.120 --> 3:15:12.120]  Out on this today
[3:15:12.120 --> 3:15:14.120]  Again, this is out of the daily skeptic
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:16.120]  Youngest children most harmed by lockdowns
[3:15:16.120 --> 3:15:18.120]  Research finds
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:20.120]  The youngest children have been most affected
[3:15:20.120 --> 3:15:22.120]  By lockdowns and school closures during the
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:23.120]  Covid pandemic
[3:15:23.120 --> 3:15:25.120]  With new research finding the educational progress
[3:15:25.120 --> 3:15:26.120]  And social development
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:28.120]  Four and five year old
[3:15:28.120 --> 3:15:30.120]  Suffered severely during
[3:15:30.120 --> 3:15:32.120]  Their first year at school
[3:15:32.120 --> 3:15:34.120]  Aggressive behaviour
[3:15:34.120 --> 3:15:35.120]  Such as biting and hitting
[3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:37.120]  Feelings of struggling in class
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:38.120]  Are being overwhelmed
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:40.120]  Are now commonplace
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:42.120]  They've wrecked an entire generation
[3:15:42.120 --> 3:15:43.120]  Of children
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:45.120]  Who's going to take responsibility for it
[3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:47.120]  And who's going to stand up to the WHO
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:49.120]  And say no, we're not going to lockdown
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:51.120]  Again, it was a disaster
[3:15:51.120 --> 3:15:53.120]  It's not happening again
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:16:20.120]  We'll be back
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:24.120]  We'll be back
[3:16:24.120 --> 3:16:53.120]  We'll be back
[3:16:54.120 --> 3:16:56.120]  We're now proud to release
[3:16:56.120 --> 3:16:58.120]  The Redux line of Faraday bags

[3:17:26.120 --> 3:17:28.120]  And protect them from remote wiping
[3:17:28.120 --> 3:17:30.120]  Tracking and tampering

[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:05.120]  Circumvent and override the sensors
[3:18:05.120 --> 3:18:07.120]  Has been Patriot apparel

[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:12.120]  And so we can push people to websites
[3:18:12.120 --> 3:18:13.120]  Like infowars.com

[3:18:15.120 --> 3:18:16.120]  And how to stop it
[3:18:16.120 --> 3:18:17.120]  Now ladies and gentlemen
[3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:18.120]  Two months ago we announced
[3:18:18.120 --> 3:18:20.120]  We're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts
[3:18:20.120 --> 3:18:22.120]  Some of which go back more than 25 years

[3:18:25.120 --> 3:18:27.120]  And will only exist in your closet

[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:35.120]  And they'll be history
[3:18:35.120 --> 3:18:37.120]  We're selling them all at cost

[3:19:09.120 --> 3:19:11.120]  And they'll never be made again
[3:19:11.120 --> 3:19:12.120]  The bank that owns the mint
[3:19:12.120 --> 3:19:13.120]  That has started putting these out
[3:19:13.120 --> 3:19:14.120]  The last few years
[3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:17.120]  Just sold out of 300,000
[3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:18.120]  Of a similar offering

[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:21.120]  Than what we're selling these for

[3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:45.120]  All of the great success
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:47.120]  We have had together
[3:19:47.120 --> 3:19:48.120]  Would not have happened
[3:19:48.120 --> 3:19:49.120]  We are the tip of the spear
[3:19:49.120 --> 3:19:50.120]  You are the tip of the spear
[3:19:50.120 --> 3:19:51.120]  And I salute you and thank you
[3:19:51.120 --> 3:20:20.120]  Visit infowarstore.com today
[3:20:21.120 --> 3:20:23.120]  Well the deep state
[3:20:23.120 --> 3:20:25.120]  Suffered a big blow yesterday
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:26.120]  When it was forced to suspend
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:29.120]  It's creepy ministry of truth
[3:20:29.120 --> 3:20:30.120]  Disinformation board
[3:20:30.120 --> 3:20:32.120]  And they said they did so
[3:20:32.120 --> 3:20:34.120]  On the premise that the right wing
[3:20:34.120 --> 3:20:36.120]  The conservative media had engaged
[3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:38.120]  In a coordinated campaign
[3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:41.120]  Of disinformation to mischaracterize
[3:20:41.120 --> 3:20:44.120]  The true intention of this body
[3:20:44.120 --> 3:20:46.120]  Which again is quite ironic
[3:20:46.120 --> 3:20:48.120]  Given it was headed up
[3:20:48.120 --> 3:20:49.120]  Or planned to be headed up
[3:20:49.120 --> 3:20:51.120]  By Nina Jankowitz
[3:20:51.120 --> 3:20:53.120]  Dr. The Mary Poppins
[3:20:53.120 --> 3:20:54.120]  Of disinformation
[3:20:54.120 --> 3:20:56.120]  Somebody who has a history
[3:20:56.120 --> 3:20:58.120]  Replied with pushing
[3:20:58.120 --> 3:21:01.120]  The most egregious disinformation
[3:21:01.120 --> 3:21:02.120]  You could ever imagine
[3:21:02.120 --> 3:21:03.120]  We have a headline here
[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:05.120]  Up on summit.news
[3:21:05.120 --> 3:21:07.120]  Government claims DHS disinfo
[3:21:07.120 --> 3:21:08.120]  Board is shut down
[3:21:08.120 --> 3:21:09.120]  Because of disinfo
[3:21:09.120 --> 3:21:11.120]  Again that's incredibly ironic
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:13.120]  Because they cite the reason
[3:21:13.120 --> 3:21:14.120]  For shutting it down
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:15.120]  Being disinfo
[3:21:15.120 --> 3:21:16.120]  Well that narrative
[3:21:16.120 --> 3:21:18.120]  Is literally disinfo
[3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:21.120]  It wasn't a coordinated smear campaign
[3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:24.120]  It's called legitimate Britishism
[3:21:24.120 --> 3:21:26.120]  And I made a video about this earlier today
[3:21:26.120 --> 3:21:28.120]  Big sis is big mad
[3:21:28.120 --> 3:21:30.120]  Here it is
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:38.120]  Big sis is big sad
[3:21:38.120 --> 3:21:40.120]  The Department of Homeland Security
[3:21:40.120 --> 3:21:41.120]  Has been forced to suspend
[3:21:41.120 --> 3:21:44.120]  It's creepy disinformation board
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:46.120]  Before it even got off the ground
[3:21:46.120 --> 3:21:48.120]  It's would be leader Nina Jankowitz
[3:21:48.120 --> 3:21:50.120]  Isn't taking it too well
[3:21:50.120 --> 3:21:52.120]  So every characterization of the board
[3:21:52.120 --> 3:21:54.120]  That you've heard up until now
[3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:55.120]  Has been incorrect
[3:21:55.120 --> 3:21:57.120]  And frankly it's kind of ironic
[3:21:57.120 --> 3:21:58.120]  That the board itself
[3:21:58.120 --> 3:22:00.120]  Was taken over by disinformation
[3:22:00.120 --> 3:22:02.120]  When it was meant to fight it
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:04.120]  You know what's also kind of ironic
[3:22:04.120 --> 3:22:06.120]  Unit to fight disinformation
[3:22:06.120 --> 3:22:08.120]  Being headed up by you
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:09.120]  The queen of disinformation
[3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:12.120]  You claimed the deep state doesn't exist
[3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:14.120]  Talking about the deep state
[3:22:14.120 --> 3:22:15.120]  And things like that
[3:22:15.120 --> 3:22:18.120]  Which is a thread among conspiracy
[3:22:18.120 --> 3:22:20.120]  Communities here in the United States
[3:22:20.120 --> 3:22:22.120]  That there is a secret cabal here in Washington
[3:22:22.120 --> 3:22:24.120]  Working to undermine the American people
[3:22:24.120 --> 3:22:26.120]  It couldn't be farther from the truth
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:27.120]  That's disinformation
[3:22:27.120 --> 3:22:28.120]  You promoted the claim
[3:22:28.120 --> 3:22:30.120]  That the Hunter Biden laptop story
[3:22:30.120 --> 3:22:31.120]  Was Russian propaganda
[3:22:31.120 --> 3:22:32.120]  That's disinformation
[3:22:32.120 --> 3:22:34.120]  You cited Christopher Steele
[3:22:34.120 --> 3:22:36.120]  As an expert on disinformation
[3:22:36.120 --> 3:22:38.120]  The author of the infamous
[3:22:38.120 --> 3:22:39.120]  Trump P-gate dossier
[3:22:39.120 --> 3:22:41.120]  Which was wholly a product
[3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:42.120]  Of disinformation
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:44.120]  You defended and excused
[3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:47.120]  The behavior of Ukrainian paramilitary groups
[3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:49.120]  Including the Azov Battalion
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:51.120]  While they were literally committing war crimes
[3:22:51.120 --> 3:22:52.120]  That's disinformation
[3:22:52.120 --> 3:22:54.120]  You falsely characterized parents
[3:22:54.120 --> 3:22:57.120]  Legitimate concerns about critical race theory
[3:22:57.120 --> 3:22:58.120]  Being taught in schools
[3:22:58.120 --> 3:22:59.120]  There's disinformation
[3:22:59.120 --> 3:23:01.120]  That's disinformation
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:02.120]  Disinformation
[3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:03.120]  It's okay when we do it
[3:23:03.120 --> 3:23:04.120]  It's kind of ironic
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:06.120]  Then the disinformation board
[3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:08.120]  Is being shut down because of disinformation
[3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:09.120]  Isn't it interesting
[3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:12.120]  How there's almost a total Venn diagram overlap
[3:23:12.120 --> 3:23:14.120]  Between disinformation
[3:23:14.120 --> 3:23:17.120]  And information that embarrasses the regime
[3:23:17.120 --> 3:23:18.120]  Funny that, isn't it?
[3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:21.120]  Almost like the entire contrived moral panic
[3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:22.120]  Over disinformation
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:25.120]  Is just an excuse to shut down legitimate dissent
[3:23:25.120 --> 3:23:26.120]  It's kind of ironic
[3:23:26.120 --> 3:23:28.120]  As journalist Glenn Greenwald notes
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:31.120]  She complains about right-wing disinformation
[3:23:31.120 --> 3:23:33.120]  Scoppering the DHS Disinfo Board
[3:23:33.120 --> 3:23:35.120]  When the most devastating indictment
[3:23:35.120 --> 3:23:36.120]  Of the whole operation
[3:23:36.120 --> 3:23:39.120]  And her was published by the nation
[3:23:39.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  A left-wing news outlet
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:42.120]  It's kind of ironic
[3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:43.120]  Newsflash
[3:23:43.120 --> 3:23:46.120]  Large numbers of people being rightly concerned
[3:23:46.120 --> 3:23:48.120]  About the government literally launching
[3:23:48.120 --> 3:23:49.120]  A ministry of truth
[3:23:49.120 --> 3:23:51.120]  Isn't a coordinated attack
[3:23:51.120 --> 3:23:54.120]  Isn't right-wing disinformation
[3:23:54.120 --> 3:23:56.120]  It's speaking truth to power
[3:23:56.120 --> 3:23:58.120]  All these sensationalist narratives
[3:23:58.120 --> 3:23:59.120]  About what the board was
[3:23:59.120 --> 3:24:01.120]  What people thought the board was going to do
[3:24:01.120 --> 3:24:02.120]  Are completely wrong
[3:24:02.120 --> 3:24:04.120]  It was a coordinating mechanism
[3:24:04.120 --> 3:24:05.120]  Oh, don't worry, everyone
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:08.120]  It was just a coordinating mechanism
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:11.120]  This isn't happening, everyone look away please
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:13.120]  Nothing to see here
[3:24:13.120 --> 3:24:15.120]  That just happened to be led by someone
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:18.120]  Who literally said free speech makes her shudder
[3:24:18.120 --> 3:24:20.120]  By someone who said free speech was like
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:22.120]  Quote fairy dust
[3:24:22.120 --> 3:24:24.120]  Suggesting it doesn't even exist
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:26.120]  By somebody who demanded the power
[3:24:26.120 --> 3:24:29.120]  For trustworthy regime propagandists
[3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:32.120]  Like her to edit your tweets
[3:24:32.120 --> 3:24:35.120]  And I am eligible for it because I'm verified
[3:24:35.120 --> 3:24:36.120]  But there are a lot of people
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:38.120]  Who shouldn't be verified
[3:24:38.120 --> 3:24:40.120]  Who aren't, you know, legit in my opinion
[3:24:40.120 --> 3:24:41.120]  I mean, they are real people
[3:24:41.120 --> 3:24:43.120]  But they're not trustworthy
[3:24:43.120 --> 3:24:47.120]  Anyway, so verified people can
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:50.120]  Essentially start to edit Twitter
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:52.120]  The same sort of way that Wikipedia is
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:55.120]  So they can add context to certain tweets
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:56.120]  This initiative wasn't involved
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:24:58.120]  In policing speech and neither was I
[3:24:58.120 --> 3:25:00.120]  No, they're not policing your speech
[3:25:00.120 --> 3:25:03.120]  They're just editing your tweets
[3:25:03.120 --> 3:25:04.120]  By someone who wrote a book
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:07.120]  Replied with bizarre hypothetical scenarios
[3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:10.120]  About men being sexist to her on the street
[3:25:10.120 --> 3:25:12.120]  Deploying the same words they use on social media
[3:25:12.120 --> 3:25:14.120]  One example being tiktok
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:17.120]  That's the sound of your biological clock ticking
[3:25:17.120 --> 3:25:19.120]  Better go home and try to make a baby
[3:25:19.120 --> 3:25:21.120]  Before it's too late, sweetheart
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:23.120]  No eggs, no empty eggs
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:25.120]  You don't have any eggs
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:27.120]  By someone who wrote in said book
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:29.120]  That such misogynists should be arrested
[3:25:29.120 --> 3:25:30.120]  By the police
[3:25:30.120 --> 3:25:32.120]  By someone who called Elon Musk
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:34.120]  A quote, online abuser
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:37.120]  By someone who said America was too free-spirited
[3:25:37.120 --> 3:25:38.120]  By someone who said the lockdowns
[3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:40.120]  Weren't draconian enough
[3:25:40.120 --> 3:25:42.120]  By someone who literally tweeted
[3:25:42.120 --> 3:25:45.120]  Quote, force away, lock us down
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:48.120]  And by someone who sang with zealous glee
[3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:50.120]  About wanting to step on her enemies
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:54.120]  I wanna be rich, famous and powerful
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:58.120]  Step on all my enemies and never do a thing
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:25:59.120]  But according to Jenkowitz
[3:25:59.120 --> 3:26:02.120]  She's a nuanced, reasonable person
[3:26:02.120 --> 3:26:05.120]  I have prided myself over my career
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:08.120]  Of being a really nuanced, reasonable person
[3:26:08.120 --> 3:26:09.120]  Hold up, scary poppins
[3:26:09.120 --> 3:26:10.120]  Let's do a quick recap
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:12.120]  Free speech is sinister
[3:26:12.120 --> 3:26:14.120]  Shoulder inducing and shouldn't exist
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:16.120]  Approved regime apparatchiks
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:19.120]  Should have the power to edit and censor your tweets
[3:26:19.120 --> 3:26:21.120]  The government run by her
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:23.120]  Gets to decide what's free speech
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:24.120]  And what's disinformation
[3:26:24.120 --> 3:26:26.120]  Men should be thrown in prison
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:28.120]  For online misogyny
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:30.120]  And lock me down harder, daddy
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:31.120]  So reasonable
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:32.120]  Reasonable person
[3:26:32.120 --> 3:26:34.120]  None of that sounds nuanced or reasonable
[3:26:34.120 --> 3:26:37.120]  But it does totally sound like a narcissistic control freak
[3:26:37.120 --> 3:26:39.120]  And someone who shouldn't be in charge
[3:26:39.120 --> 3:26:42.120]  Of anything remotely related to free speech
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:44.120]  She also ludicrously claims
[3:26:44.120 --> 3:26:46.120]  That she was non-partisan
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:48.120]  To say that I'm just a partisan actor
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:49.120]  Was wildly out of contact
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:51.120]  You amplified the Pgate dossier
[3:26:51.120 --> 3:26:53.120]  A piece of actual disinformation
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:56.120]  That the regime pushed to try to stop Trump
[3:26:56.120 --> 3:26:57.120]  Winning the election
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:26:59.120]  You ceaselessly raged against Trump
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:00.120]  Before the election
[3:27:00.120 --> 3:27:03.120]  Then amplified the actual disinformation
[3:27:03.120 --> 3:27:05.120]  That Russia interfered in it
[3:27:05.120 --> 3:27:06.120]  To help him win
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:08.120]  You called on people to vote for Hillary Clinton
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:10.120]  Literally tweeting hashtag
[3:27:10.120 --> 3:27:11.120]  I'm with her
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:14.120]  While claiming a Trump win would embolden ISIS
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:15.120]  Trump actually destroyed ISIS
[3:27:15.120 --> 3:27:17.120]  You were recruited by a left-wing
[3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:21.120]  Anti-Trump resistance group in 2017
[3:27:21.120 --> 3:27:23.120]  Your BFF is Taylor Lorenz
[3:27:23.120 --> 3:27:25.120]  A hyper-partisan shit-lip journal
[3:27:25.120 --> 3:27:28.120]  Who made a career out of docs and conservatives
[3:27:28.120 --> 3:27:30.120]  The same left-wing activist
[3:27:30.120 --> 3:27:32.120]  Who said you should be, quote,
[3:27:32.120 --> 3:27:34.120]  Off limits from criticism
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  And you've got the nerve to claim your non-partisan
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:38.120]  I'm just a partisan actor
[3:27:38.120 --> 3:27:39.120]  Was wildly out of contact
[3:27:39.120 --> 3:27:41.120]  Do you think we're stupid?
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:43.120]  Evidently, the answer is yes
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:48.120]  Now, there was an excellent article
[3:27:48.120 --> 3:27:50.120]  Written by John Nolte
[3:27:50.120 --> 3:27:52.120]  Out of Breitbart on this very subject
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:53.120]  Washington Post debates
[3:27:53.120 --> 3:27:57.120]  As itself in eulogy to Biden's fascist disinformation board
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:27:59.120]  And he lists, or goes through a list
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  Of the fact that these same deep-state regime entities
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:06.120]  That get to decide what's disinformation and what's not
[3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:09.120]  This is what they were responsible for
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:12.120]  That telling us that Trump was a Russian spy
[3:28:12.120 --> 3:28:15.120]  The coronavirus vaccine would stop the spread
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:17.120]  Global warming is real, it's not
[3:28:17.120 --> 3:28:20.120]  Black Lives Matter rioters are immune to the virus
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:21.120]  Remember that
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:23.120]  Inflation is transitory
[3:28:23.120 --> 3:28:25.120]  Raising taxes lowers inflation
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:28.120]  And to Biden's laptop is Russian disinformation
[3:28:28.120 --> 3:28:30.120]  The Capitol Hill police officers
[3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:32.120]  Was beaten to death by Trump supporters
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:35.120]  All that was, of course, completely false
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:37.120]  Yet the same regime that came out
[3:28:37.120 --> 3:28:40.120]  With all that weaponized, harmful disinformation
[3:28:40.120 --> 3:28:43.120]  Thinks it gets the right to set itself up
[3:28:43.120 --> 3:28:46.120]  As the ultimate arbiter of the definition
[3:28:46.120 --> 3:28:48.120]  Of disinformation, they don't
[3:28:48.120 --> 3:28:51.120]  And at least for the time being, this program is rightly
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:29:20.120]  Suspended.
[3:29:20.120 --> 3:29:22.120]  And we have this high quality

[3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:24.120]  Live from London, England
[3:33:24.120 --> 3:33:26.120]  It's Hall Joseph Watson
[3:33:26.120 --> 3:33:28.120]  With Summit.News
[3:33:28.120 --> 3:33:30.120]  So big sis, it's big sad
[3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:32.120]  The Ministry of Truth has at least
[3:33:32.120 --> 3:33:34.120]  Temporarily been disbanded
[3:33:34.120 --> 3:33:36.120]  And now the legacy media is out
[3:33:36.120 --> 3:33:38.120]  Pushing more disinformation
[3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:40.120]  That it was because of a coordinated
[3:33:40.120 --> 3:33:42.120]  Right-wing disinformation campaign
[3:33:42.120 --> 3:33:44.120]  And now the legacy media is out
[3:33:44.120 --> 3:33:46.120]  Pushing more disinformation
[3:33:46.120 --> 3:33:48.120]  That it was because of a coordinated
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:33:51.120]  Right-wing disinformation campaign
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:54.120]  That claim within and of itself is disinformation
[3:33:54.120 --> 3:33:57.120]  It wasn't coordinated smear campaign
[3:33:57.120 --> 3:33:59.120]  It was legitimate criticism
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:01.120]  Speaking truth to power
[3:34:01.120 --> 3:34:03.120]  The genuine expression of concern
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:06.120]  About handing power to the government
[3:34:06.120 --> 3:34:08.120]  To decide what's free speech
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:10.120]  What's dangerous disinformation
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:12.120]  That gets banned, as we know
[3:34:12.120 --> 3:34:14.120]  Governments working hand in hand
[3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:17.120]  With social media to that very agenda
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:19.120]  I mentioned this John Nolte article
[3:34:19.120 --> 3:34:21.120]  In Breitbart
[3:34:21.120 --> 3:34:23.120]  Washington Post debases itself
[3:34:23.120 --> 3:34:25.120]  In eulogy to Biden's fascist disinformation
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:26.120]  Board
[3:34:26.120 --> 3:34:28.120]  He talks about the Washington Post
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:30.120]  Article by Taylor Lorenz
[3:34:30.120 --> 3:34:32.120]  Who as I mentioned in the video
[3:34:32.120 --> 3:34:34.120]  Literally made a career out of
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:36.120]  Harassing and doxing conservatives
[3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:38.120]  And then cry bullies and claims
[3:34:38.120 --> 3:34:40.120]  That people are harassing her
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:42.120]  By providing her with legitimate
[3:34:42.120 --> 3:34:43.120]  Criticism
[3:34:43.120 --> 3:34:45.120]  He lists a few other things
[3:34:45.120 --> 3:34:47.120]  That I didn't even get the chance
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:49.120]  To mention in the video
[3:34:49.120 --> 3:34:51.120]  From Nina Jankiewicz
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:34:53.120]  Of course, Pitt postures herself
[3:34:53.120 --> 3:34:56.120]  As a nuanced reasonable person
[3:34:56.120 --> 3:34:58.120]  During that SMBC interview
[3:34:58.120 --> 3:35:00.120]  With Chris Hayes
[3:35:00.120 --> 3:35:02.120]  But he makes the point in this article
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:04.120]  That nowhere does the Washington Post
[3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:06.120]  Tell its emotionally unstable subscribers
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:08.120]  That Jankiewicz declared it
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:10.120]  A national security threat
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:12.120]  To ridicule her
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:15.120]  Vice president fraudulency Kamala Harris
[3:35:15.120 --> 3:35:17.120]  So she literally thinks
[3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:19.120]  It's a national security threat
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:21.120]  To ridicule the vice president
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:23.120]  Of the United States
[3:35:23.120 --> 3:35:25.120]  While the person writing the article
[3:35:25.120 --> 3:35:26.120]  Taylor Lorenz
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:28.120]  Says that she should be
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:30.120]  Beyond criticism
[3:35:30.120 --> 3:35:33.120]  I notice a common pattern emerging here
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  Which is these ruthless technocrats
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:37.120]  These control freaks
[3:35:37.120 --> 3:35:39.120]  Thinking that your free speech
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:41.120]  Doesn't include the right to criticize
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:43.120]  Government officials
[3:35:43.120 --> 3:35:45.120]  Oh, Russia does that, they're bad
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:47.120]  They ban dissidents
[3:35:47.120 --> 3:35:48.120]  They imprison dissidents
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:49.120]  They kidnap dissidents
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:50.120]  That's terrible
[3:35:50.120 --> 3:35:52.120]  But we want the power to do it too
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:35:54.120]  It's okay when we do it
[3:35:54.120 --> 3:35:56.120]  He adds
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:35:58.120]  Jankiewicz wanted to give approved elites
[3:35:58.120 --> 3:36:00.120]  The power to edit everyone else's tweets
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:02.120]  I mentioned that in the video
[3:36:02.120 --> 3:36:05.120]  She stated her fear of free speech absolutists
[3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:06.120]  Which in her mind means
[3:36:06.120 --> 3:36:08.120]  People who criticize those in power
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:10.120]  Oh my god, the horror
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:12.120]  She spread the audacious lie
[3:36:12.120 --> 3:36:14.120]  That social media censors leftists
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:17.120]  And marginalize communities more than conservatives
[3:36:17.120 --> 3:36:20.120]  Which on the face of it is absolutely insane
[3:36:20.120 --> 3:36:22.120]  Go through a list of prominent
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:24.120]  Right-wingers conservatives
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:26.120]  Banned on Twitter over the past five years
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:29.120]  Compare that to prominent leftists
[3:36:29.120 --> 3:36:32.120]  Bit of a difference there
[3:36:32.120 --> 3:36:34.120]  Social media censors leftists
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:36.120]  How she spread the alpha bank hoax
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:38.120]  Or her propaganda
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:40.120]  About how men can give birth
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:42.120]  And yes, she also said that parents
[3:36:42.120 --> 3:36:44.120]  Who complain about CRT
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:47.120]  Are basically pushing disinformation themselves
[3:36:47.120 --> 3:36:49.120]  That common theme that it doesn't exist
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:52.120]  Again, anything embarrassing, harmful
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:54.120]  To the narrative of the regime
[3:36:54.120 --> 3:36:55.120]  It doesn't exist
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:36:57.120]  Apart from when they talk about it
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:36:58.120]  And then it's a good thing
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:00.120]  Like the great replacement theory
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:03.120]  Or, he goes on to mention
[3:37:03.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  Of fantasizing about having ghost sex
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:07.120]  With an underage Harry Potter
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:09.120]  Absolutely disgusting
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:11.120]  Very weird woman
[3:37:11.120 --> 3:37:13.120]  If you look into her background and her history
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:16.120]  And very positive for Americans
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:18.120]  That she's not in charge of a board
[3:37:18.120 --> 3:37:20.120]  That could regulate free speech
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:22.120]  Could punish people for literally
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:24.120]  Just criticizing government officials
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:26.120]  And on that subject
[3:37:26.120 --> 3:37:28.120]  Twitter introduces policy to prevent
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:30.120]  Spreading of misinformation during crises
[3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:32.120]  Again, what is a crisis
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:34.120]  To an hysterical mob?
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:35.120]  Truly everything
[3:37:35.120 --> 3:37:37.120]  Twitter announced on Thursday
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:39.120]  That is introduced a new global policy
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:41.120]  To address the spread of misinformation
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:43.120]  During crisis situations
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:45.120]  And again, this is so they can control
[3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:47.120]  The narrative the same with everything
[3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:49.120]  That happens on social media
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:51.120]  Another thing happened this morning
[3:37:51.120 --> 3:37:53.120]  In the same vein
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:55.120]  Occasionally you'll find on Twitter
[3:37:55.120 --> 3:37:58.120]  That, for whatever reason
[3:37:58.120 --> 3:38:00.120]  An organic trending hashtag
[3:38:00.120 --> 3:38:02.120]  Slips through the net
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:04.120]  Through the brick wall of censorship
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:06.120]  And they immediately call upon
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:08.120]  Their much wanted fact checkers
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:10.120]  Who of course we know are just
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:12.120]  Propagandists again for the regime
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:14.120]  Literally working hand in hand with governments
[3:38:14.120 --> 3:38:16.120]  To denounce said topic
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:18.120]  Whatever it may be
[3:38:18.120 --> 3:38:20.120]  This morning it happened to be chemtrails
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:22.120]  People in the United Kingdom
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:24.120]  Posting all these chemtrails
[3:38:24.120 --> 3:38:26.120]  Over their houses whether you believe
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:28.120]  That's a legitimate issue or not
[3:38:28.120 --> 3:38:30.120]  There are arguments on both sides
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:32.120]  Within about an hour
[3:38:32.120 --> 3:38:34.120]  They changed it from just an organic
[3:38:34.120 --> 3:38:36.120]  Trending topic, chemtrails
[3:38:36.120 --> 3:38:38.120]  To an official fact check
[3:38:38.120 --> 3:38:40.120]  Of chemtrails and that it's all BS
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:42.120]  And that people who push it
[3:38:42.120 --> 3:38:44.120]  Are all insane conspiracy theorists
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:46.120]  And they do that on a regular basis
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:48.120]  Well now they announced today
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:50.120]  We're introducing our crisis misinformation policy
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:38:52.120]  A global policy that will guide our efforts
[3:38:52.120 --> 3:38:54.120]  To elevate credible authoritative information
[3:38:54.120 --> 3:38:56.120]  And will help to ensure viral misinformation
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:38:58.120]  Isn't amplified or recommended
[3:38:58.120 --> 3:39:00.120]  By us during crises
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:02.120]  Again another attempt to control
[3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:04.120]  The narrative
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:06.120]  Talking about controlling the narrative
[3:39:06.120 --> 3:39:08.120]  Let's go to this UFO video
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:10.120]  Because back in the 90s as I explained
[3:39:10.120 --> 3:39:12.120]  UFOs alien abduction was seen
[3:39:12.120 --> 3:39:14.120]  As a crank fringe extremist
[3:39:14.120 --> 3:39:16.120]  Theory now it's endorsed
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:18.120]  By the establishment
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:20.120]  Now they're having congressional hearings
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:22.120]  About it and now the deep state
[3:39:22.120 --> 3:39:24.120]  Is literally legitimizing it
[3:39:24.120 --> 3:39:26.120]  Why could that possibly
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:28.120]  Be? Here's the video
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:30.120]  Pentagon confirms UFOs are real
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:32.120]  Let's roll it
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:34.120]  The Pentagon has confirmed that at least
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:36.120]  Some UFOs are real
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:38.120]  And are unexplainable
[3:39:38.120 --> 3:39:40.120]  The admission was made during the first congressional hearing
[3:39:40.120 --> 3:39:42.120]  Into the subjective UFOs for 50 years
[3:39:42.120 --> 3:39:44.120]  Top military officials
[3:39:44.120 --> 3:39:46.120]  Spoke about how some of these
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:48.120]  Unexplained aerial phenomena
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:50.120]  UAPs, the military term
[3:39:50.120 --> 3:39:52.120]  For UFOs, had no discernible
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:54.120]  Means of propulsion
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:56.120]  This include 11 UFO near
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:39:58.120]  Misses with US aircraft
[3:39:58.120 --> 3:40:00.120]  Including this newly released video
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:02.120]  Captured by a pilot in the cockpit
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:04.120]  Of a navy fighter jet
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:20.120]  There are a small handful of events
[3:40:20.120 --> 3:40:22.120]  In which there are flight characteristics
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:24.120]  That we can't explain with the data
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:26.120]  We have available, said Scott Bray
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:28.120]  The deputy director of naval intelligence
[3:40:28.120 --> 3:40:30.120]  Those are obviously the ones that are of most
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:32.120]  Interest to us. My question is
[3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:34.120]  Why is all this coming out now?
[3:40:34.120 --> 3:40:36.120]  I grew up in the 90s completely
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:38.120]  Obsessed with the subject of UFOs
[3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:40.120]  But back then governments
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:42.120]  And the legacy media treated the entire
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:44.120]  Issue with nothing but scorn
[3:40:44.120 --> 3:40:46.120]  And derision. Ufologists
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:48.120]  Were seen as fringe cranks
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:50.120]  And people who reported sightings
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:52.120]  Were ridiculed. And all this was after
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:54.120]  Decades of popular culture
[3:40:54.120 --> 3:40:56.120]  In terms of television and blockbuster movies
[3:40:56.120 --> 3:40:58.120]  Satiating the public
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:00.120]  With the social engineering that it was
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:02.120]  Actually all real and all being
[3:41:02.120 --> 3:41:04.120]  Covered up. What changed?
[3:41:04.120 --> 3:41:06.120]  Why, around 10 to 15 years ago
[3:41:06.120 --> 3:41:08.120]  Did the establishment suddenly do a 180?
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:10.120]  And start treating
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:12.120]  The subject with so much seriousness
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:14.120]  It's widely accepted that the
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:16.120]  Deep state has exploited the obsession
[3:41:16.120 --> 3:41:18.120]  Around UFOs as a
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:20.120]  Camouflage for top secret military
[3:41:20.120 --> 3:41:22.120]  Technology. It's always helpful to
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:24.120]  Push the idea that people witnessing
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:26.120]  Tests of cutting edge propulsion
[3:41:26.120 --> 3:41:28.120]  Systems and exotic aircraft
[3:41:28.120 --> 3:41:30.120]  Were actually seeing alien spaceships
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:32.120]  And what about alien abductions?
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:34.120]  Cattle mutilations?
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:36.120]  Could the explanation be something far
[3:41:36.120 --> 3:41:38.120]  More sinister than benevolent
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:40.120]  Alien visitation and
[3:41:40.120 --> 3:41:42.120]  Something far closer to home?
[3:41:42.120 --> 3:41:44.120]  If you thought the last two years proved
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:41:46.120]  How easy it was to manipulate the public
[3:41:46.120 --> 3:41:48.120]  Into mass compliance
[3:41:48.120 --> 3:41:50.120]  Just think what the legitimization
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:52.120]  Of alien visitation
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:54.120]  Or the prospect of off-planetary
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:56.120]  Threats would accomplish
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:41:58.120]  Just ponder what technocratic
[3:41:58.120 --> 3:42:00.120]  Control freak hell
[3:42:00.120 --> 3:42:02.120]  Could be unleashed if the public
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:04.120]  Is convinced that ET is about to invade
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:06.120]  Why do you think the subject
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:08.120]  Of UFOs and aliens is now being
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:10.120]  Endorsed by the Pentagon
[3:42:10.120 --> 3:42:12.120]  The legacy media and the establishment
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:14.120]  In general? Let me know in the comments
[3:42:14.120 --> 3:42:16.120]  Below.
[3:42:16.120 --> 3:42:18.120]  So there you have it again
[3:42:18.120 --> 3:42:20.120]  The establishment having flipped
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:22.120]  From about 15 years ago
[3:42:22.120 --> 3:42:24.120]  From deriding the entire UFO alien
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:26.120]  Abduction subject as
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:28.120]  Fringe, crank, conspiracy
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:30.120]  Theorist material
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:32.120]  Now literally having congressional hearings
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:34.120]  Where top military brass
[3:42:34.120 --> 3:42:36.120]  Say that at least in some cases
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:38.120]  It's real, they can't explain it
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:40.120]  Used to be the case that they were
[3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:42.120]  Supposedly terrified about revealing
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:44.120]  The existence of aliens to the public
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:46.120]  Because they panic
[3:42:46.120 --> 3:42:48.120]  Or well's war of the world style
[3:42:48.120 --> 3:42:50.120]  But now they've completely flipped
[3:42:50.120 --> 3:42:52.120]  Why is that very interesting
[3:42:52.120 --> 3:43:20.120]  We'll be back. Don't go away.
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:24.120]  It is the purest, highest quality
[3:43:24.120 --> 3:43:26.120]  Atomic iodine you're going to find
[3:43:26.120 --> 3:43:28.120]  Most other iodine out there
[3:43:28.120 --> 3:43:30.120]  Is bound to other minerals
[3:43:30.120 --> 3:43:32.120]  And compounds so you don't absorb it
[3:43:32.120 --> 3:43:34.120]  At all or fully
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:36.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got a limited supply
[3:43:36.120 --> 3:43:38.120]  And it's been sold out for months
[3:43:38.120 --> 3:43:40.120]  Because supply chain right downs
[3:43:40.120 --> 3:43:42.120]  But despite that, we're selling it
[3:43:42.120 --> 3:43:44.120]  At 25% off for one more week
[3:43:44.120 --> 3:43:46.120]  Than it goes back to full price
[3:43:46.120 --> 3:43:48.120]  Within two weeks the current sales rate
[3:43:48.120 --> 3:43:50.120]  Is going to sell out. Experience X2
[3:43:50.120 --> 3:43:52.120]  Today at mfourstore.com

[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:56.120]  Take action now.
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:43:58.120]  There is very little
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:00.120]  Contemporary study in the world
[3:44:00.120 --> 3:44:02.120]  Of the planet's ruling class
[3:44:02.120 --> 3:44:04.120]  Not in communist China
[3:44:04.120 --> 3:44:06.120]  Not in Mexico
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:08.120]  Not in the United States, not anywhere
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:10.120]  Is there a real study
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:12.120]  Of the planet's ruling class
[3:44:12.120 --> 3:44:14.120]  And that's done by design
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:16.120]  The large central banks that basically
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:18.120]  Control the planet will penalize
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:20.120]  And target any academics
[3:44:20.120 --> 3:44:22.120]  That look in to say the Anglo-American
[3:44:22.120 --> 3:44:24.120]  Establishment that's out of the
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:26.120]  Bilderberg Group, the trilateral commission
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:28.120]  Of the United Nations, the whole project
[3:44:28.120 --> 3:44:30.120]  Of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:32.120]  Until ten years ago the media said
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:34.120]  The control corporate media of the Bilderberg
[3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:36.120]  Group didn't exist.
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:38.120]  Well now the Bilderberg Group is public
[3:44:38.120 --> 3:44:40.120]  In its former head, still on the steering committee
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:42.120]  Is Klaus Schwab
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:44.120]  And he has set up the great reset in
[3:44:44.120 --> 3:44:46.120]  Global government. And if
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:48.120]  The Liberty movement worldwide
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:50.120]  We don't address the globalist head on
[3:44:50.120 --> 3:44:52.120]  About the second to your worldwide
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:54.120]  Authoritarian corporate takeover
[3:44:54.120 --> 3:44:56.120]  We don't have a shot. We do expose them
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:44:58.120]  We can beat them easily.
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:45:00.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, Ultra-12, the highest quality
[3:45:00.120 --> 3:45:02.120]  B-12 you're going to find on the market
[3:45:02.120 --> 3:45:04.120]  Has been sold off for many months
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:06.120]  But now it's back in stock at

[3:45:14.120 --> 3:45:16.120]  That it energizes every other
[3:45:16.120 --> 3:45:18.120]  Vitamin mineral in your body

[3:45:26.120 --> 3:45:28.120]  And it is a game changer

[3:45:32.120 --> 3:45:34.120]  And despite the fact it's back in stock
[3:45:34.120 --> 3:45:36.120]  And despite the fact it's sold very quickly
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:38.120]  It is 40% off

[3:45:58.120 --> 3:46:00.120]  It's an Info Wars Republic Defense card
[3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:02.120]  With original Info Wars art
[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:04.120]  Designed by yours truly
[3:46:04.120 --> 3:46:06.120]  With a little gold bar
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:08.120]  And on the back it's got a hologram
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:10.120]  There are only 25,000 of these
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:12.120]  And they'll never be made again
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:14.120]  The bank that owns the Mint
[3:46:14.120 --> 3:46:16.120]  That has started putting these out the last few years
[3:46:16.120 --> 3:46:18.120]  Just sold out of 300,000
[3:46:18.120 --> 3:46:20.120]  Of a similar offering
[3:46:20.120 --> 3:46:22.120]  That was 40% more than what we're selling these for

[3:46:38.120 --> 3:46:40.120]  With your gold bars and so much more exclusively

[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:46.120]  Because without you, all of the great success
[3:46:46.120 --> 3:46:48.120]  We have had together would not have happened
[3:46:48.120 --> 3:46:50.120]  We are the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear
[3:46:50.120 --> 3:46:52.120]  And I salute you and thank you
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:47:09.120]  And I'll see you next time on Infowarstore.com
[3:47:09.120 --> 3:47:12.120]  Now we're going to come back into final five minutes
[3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:14.120]  And cover some of this remaining
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:26.120]  News including now they're adding new colours to the LGBT plus QI
[3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:30.120]  Whatever, however many letters they've added to it
[3:47:30.120 --> 3:47:34.120]  Almost as many colours are now being added to the flag
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:36.120]  It's beyond parody
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:38.120]  I'm going to get into that
[3:47:38.120 --> 3:47:40.120]  But we have this story
[3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:42.120]  Back in May last year
[3:47:42.120 --> 3:47:44.120]  Patrice Karn Kallors
[3:47:44.120 --> 3:47:46.120]  The co-founder of Black Lives Matter
[3:47:46.120 --> 3:47:48.120]  Constantly whinging about quote
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:52.120]  White supremacy in the housing market
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.120]  Then going on to spend 3.2 million dollars
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:57.120]  That's a good grift if you can get it
[3:47:57.120 --> 3:48:01.120]  On four homes including a 1.4 million property
[3:48:01.120 --> 3:48:05.120]  In L.A.'s rustic and semi-remote Topanga Canyon
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:09.120]  Which has a black population of just 1.6%
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:13.120]  Seems to be quite eager to get away from other black people
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  Who knows why
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:17.120]  But of course the Ponzi scheme
[3:48:17.120 --> 3:48:19.120]  That is Black Lives Matter
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:21.120]  The scandal surrounding that
[3:48:21.120 --> 3:48:23.120]  Has deepened to an infinite degree
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:26.120]  In the year since this article was published
[3:48:26.120 --> 3:48:28.120]  And here's Nigel Farage
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:31.120]  Talking about the latest scandal
[3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:33.120]  Involving Black Lives Matter
[3:48:33.120 --> 3:48:35.120]  And the Ponzi scheme of this
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:38.120]  Establishment controlled organisation
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:40.120]  Here is Nigel Farage
[3:48:40.120 --> 3:48:42.120]  Black Lives Matter
[3:48:42.120 --> 3:48:44.120]  You must remember 2020
[3:48:44.120 --> 3:48:46.120]  People chanting, screaming it
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:48.120]  There was hysteria, there were police officers
[3:48:48.120 --> 3:48:50.120]  In London taking the knee
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:53.120]  Indeed, many football teams still do
[3:48:53.120 --> 3:48:55.120]  Yes, Black Lives Matter
[3:48:55.120 --> 3:48:57.120]  This wonderful organisation campaigning
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:48:59.120]  For racial justice
[3:48:59.120 --> 3:49:02.120]  And anybody that dared to stand in its way
[3:49:02.120 --> 3:49:05.120]  Was a bad person and should be cancelled
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:08.120]  Many of us that stood up to it were
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:10.120]  I did because I knew Black Lives Matter
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  From America, I knew
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:14.120]  What it swept across after the horrible death
[3:49:14.120 --> 3:49:16.120]  Of George Floyd, I knew
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:19.120]  This was an organisation I did not trust
[3:49:19.120 --> 3:49:21.120]  I knew this was an organisation
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:23.120]  More intent on division
[3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:25.120]  That it was on bringing anyone together
[3:49:25.120 --> 3:49:28.120]  Well, try this for size
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:30.120]  The accounts have been issued
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:33.120]  For 2020 a year
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:35.120]  Which the organisation raised
[3:49:35.120 --> 3:49:37.120]  $90 million
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:39.120]  That's right, $90 million
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:41.120]  And much of the funding came from
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  The usual suspects, organisations
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:45.120]  Linked to Soros which have been backing
[3:49:45.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  BLM for years
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:49.120]  Much of it also coming from big
[3:49:49.120 --> 3:49:51.120]  Corporate America
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:53.120]  The people on the West Coast
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:55.120]  The tech giants, all of these guys
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  Most of it though coming from ordinary
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:49:59.120]  Men and women who were taken in
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:01.120]  Thinking this was a good organisation
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:03.120]  What do we learn from the accounts?
[3:50:03.120 --> 3:50:05.120]  Well, we learn that
[3:50:05.120 --> 3:50:07.120]  Patrice Calors who had been running
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:09.120]  The organisation for some years
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:11.120]  Well, she seems to have had a very good year
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:13.120]  Because she's managed to purchase
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:15.120]  Four real estate properties
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:17.120]  Since 2020 in America
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:19.120]  Including one in Los Angeles
[3:50:19.120 --> 3:50:21.120]  A nice seven bedroom pad
[3:50:21.120 --> 3:50:23.120]  Costing $6 million
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:25.120]  Yes, she owns it
[3:50:25.120 --> 3:50:27.120]  But she says that it's for
[3:50:27.120 --> 3:50:29.120]  Housing needs
[3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:31.120]  And for production studios
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:33.120]  It sounds like quite a studio
[3:50:33.120 --> 3:50:35.120]  But not content with that
[3:50:35.120 --> 3:50:37.120]  The father of her child
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  Has earned nearly $1 million
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:41.120]  Organising live events
[3:50:41.120 --> 3:50:43.120]  And surprise, surprise
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:45.120]  Her brother got a security contract
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:47.120]  For $840,000
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:51.120]  One of her fellow directors
[3:50:51.120 --> 3:50:53.120]  Has managed to earn $2.1 million
[3:50:53.120 --> 3:50:55.120]  Providing services to the company
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:50:57.120]  And the more you go through this list
[3:50:57.120 --> 3:50:59.120]  The worse and worse it gets
[3:50:59.120 --> 3:51:01.120]  It's clear
[3:51:01.120 --> 3:51:03.120]  That this woman and her friends
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:05.120]  In BLM
[3:51:05.120 --> 3:51:07.120]  Out of the open heartedness and gratitude
[3:51:07.120 --> 3:51:09.120]  Of many people who thought
[3:51:09.120 --> 3:51:11.120]  That BLM was doing the right thing
[3:51:11.120 --> 3:51:13.120]  This woman has taken
[3:51:13.120 --> 3:51:15.120]  Their money
[3:51:15.120 --> 3:51:17.120]  It is a complete and utter disgrace
[3:51:17.120 --> 3:51:19.120]  It exposes Black Lives Matter
[3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:21.120]  As a completely crooked
[3:51:21.120 --> 3:51:23.120]  Organisation intent
[3:51:23.120 --> 3:51:25.120]  On lining their own pockets
[3:51:25.120 --> 3:51:27.120]  On creating more division
[3:51:27.120 --> 3:51:29.120]  Has anything improved
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:31.120]  As a result of their protests?
[3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:33.120]  No, I don't think so
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:35.120]  I'm just wondering now
[3:51:35.120 --> 3:51:37.120]  Whether all the love is
[3:51:37.120 --> 3:51:39.120]  All the great and the good
[3:51:39.120 --> 3:51:41.120]  All of those who condemn me
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:43.120]  For what I said
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:45.120]  Whether they present match of the day
[3:51:45.120 --> 3:51:47.120]  Or whatever else it is
[3:51:47.120 --> 3:51:49.120]  Whether they're actors
[3:51:49.120 --> 3:51:51.120]  I just wonder whether any of them
[3:51:51.120 --> 3:51:53.120]  Will actually be embarrassed
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:55.120]  To apologise for backing
[3:51:55.120 --> 3:51:57.120]  This organisation, I expect
[3:51:57.120 --> 3:51:59.120]  In return, a stony
[3:51:59.120 --> 3:52:01.120]  Wall of silence
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:03.120]  But at least BLM
[3:52:03.120 --> 3:52:05.120]  Have been exposed
[3:52:05.120 --> 3:52:07.120]  And really, folks, what we should be thinking
[3:52:07.120 --> 3:52:09.120]  About is this
[3:52:09.120 --> 3:52:11.120]  Not dividing people up
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:13.120]  In terms of their race, ethnicity
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:15.120]  Sexuality, age
[3:52:15.120 --> 3:52:17.120]  Or class, what we should be doing
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:19.120]  As a society
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:21.120]  Is trying to bring people together
[3:52:21.120 --> 3:52:23.120]  Of meritocracy
[3:52:23.120 --> 3:52:25.120]  It would be so much better
[3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:27.120]  If our kids at school were taught
[3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:29.120]  To be colour-blind
[3:52:29.120 --> 3:52:31.120]  Which in many ways, naturally, they are
[3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:33.120]  I look at a friend of the weekend
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:35.120]  Who said to me, Nigel, we're probably the last generation
[3:52:35.120 --> 3:52:37.120]  Who will look upon people
[3:52:37.120 --> 3:52:39.120]  As, regardless of their skin colour
[3:52:39.120 --> 3:52:41.120]  Will be colour-blind to all of these things
[3:52:41.120 --> 3:52:43.120]  And now we're all to be divided up
[3:52:43.120 --> 3:52:45.120]  And to be labelled and to hate each other
[3:52:45.120 --> 3:52:47.120]  And to get ready
[3:52:47.120 --> 3:52:49.120]  For the great Marxist takeover
[3:52:49.120 --> 3:52:51.120]  I hope this little video
[3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:53.120]  Exposes BLM to you
[3:52:53.120 --> 3:52:55.120]  Don't be taken in by them
[3:52:55.120 --> 3:52:57.120]  Don't be taken in by anybody that supports them
[3:52:57.120 --> 3:52:59.120]  And if you see BLM
[3:52:59.120 --> 3:53:01.120]  Whether it's on a football match
[3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:03.120]  Or a cricket match
[3:53:03.120 --> 3:53:05.120]  Please tell the organisers
[3:53:05.120 --> 3:53:07.120]  To drop this corrupt organisation
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:13.120]  There you have Nigel Farage
[3:53:13.120 --> 3:53:15.120]  And again, Premier League footballers
[3:53:15.120 --> 3:53:17.120]  In England are still taking a knee
[3:53:17.120 --> 3:53:19.120]  For BLM before
[3:53:19.120 --> 3:53:21.120]  All their games
[3:53:21.120 --> 3:53:23.120]  Some of them are just standing there
[3:53:23.120 --> 3:53:25.120]  And applauding, some of them don't know what to do
[3:53:25.120 --> 3:53:27.120]  But some of them are still
[3:53:27.120 --> 3:53:29.120]  Performing this act of subservience
[3:53:29.120 --> 3:53:31.120]  Obedience to the BLM narrative
[3:53:31.120 --> 3:53:33.120]  Despite the fact that the entire narrative
[3:53:33.120 --> 3:53:35.120]  The entire motivation behind the organisation
[3:53:35.120 --> 3:53:37.120]  Being a corrupt Ponzi scheme
[3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:39.120]  Is revealed more and more
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:41.120]  Every single day
[3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:43.120]  Meanwhile
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:45.120]  Breitbart reports a new flag already
[3:53:45.120 --> 3:53:47.120]  Welk, London Mayor Sadiq
[3:53:47.120 --> 3:53:49.120]  Corn unveils new LGBTQ
[3:53:49.120 --> 3:53:51.120]  Plus flag for
[3:53:51.120 --> 3:53:53.120]  Ida Hobbit, whatever the hell that is
[3:53:53.120 --> 3:53:55.120]  London Mayor Sadiq
[3:53:55.120 --> 3:53:57.120]  Corn has apparently unveiled a new version of the LGBTQ
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:53:59.120]  Plus pride flag for international day
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:01.120]  Against homophobia, transphobia
[3:54:01.120 --> 3:54:03.120]  And biphobia, Ida Hobbit
[3:54:03.120 --> 3:54:05.120]  That seems like a
[3:54:05.120 --> 3:54:07.120]  Not a day
[3:54:07.120 --> 3:54:09.120]  It seems like every single week
[3:54:09.120 --> 3:54:11.120]  They have some kind of event to mark
[3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:13.120]  The great oppressed
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:15.120]  Down trodden movement is LGBT
[3:54:15.120 --> 3:54:17.120]  Supported by every major corporation
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:19.120]  Every major government
[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:21.120]  The entertainment industry
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  The music industry
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:25.120]  Supported by judges who will punish people
[3:54:25.120 --> 3:54:27.120]  For offending the LGBT community
[3:54:27.120 --> 3:54:29.120]  But now they've added more colours
[3:54:29.120 --> 3:54:31.120]  To the pride flag
[3:54:31.120 --> 3:54:33.120]  Yes, if you could believe that
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:35.120]  That was even physically possible
[3:54:35.120 --> 3:54:37.120]  They already added all the trans colours
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:39.120]  To the flag a few years ago
[3:54:39.120 --> 3:54:41.120]  Well now they've added
[3:54:41.120 --> 3:54:43.120]  Hot pink
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:45.120]  To symbolise women
[3:54:45.120 --> 3:54:47.120]  Apparently they added women in general
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:49.120]  A part of LGBT movement
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:51.120]  Whether they're LGBT or not
[3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:53.120]  And they've added something else
[3:54:53.120 --> 3:54:55.120]  To include
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:54:57.120]  Non-binary people
[3:54:57.120 --> 3:54:59.120]  Black, brown and queer people
[3:54:59.120 --> 3:55:01.120]  That was already included in the previous version
[3:55:03.120 --> 3:55:05.120]  And also two spirit people
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:07.120]  And god knows whoever else
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  They've released a 50 pence coin
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:11.120]  The Royal Mint
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:13.120]  Because this again group is so
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:15.120]  Down trodden and underrepresented
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:17.120]  Their flag literally flies
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:19.120]  Over government buildings
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:21.120]  In central London because they're so
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.120]  Down trodden and underrepresented
[3:55:23.120 --> 3:55:25.120]  And now Disney
[3:55:25.120 --> 3:55:27.120]  Is joining in
[3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:29.120]  On the Carnival too
[3:55:29.120 --> 3:55:31.120]  Of course Disney appealing to children
[3:55:31.120 --> 3:55:33.120]  They've now launched a new line
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:35.120]  Of LGBT clothing
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:37.120]  Despite the fact that their favourability ratings
[3:55:37.120 --> 3:55:39.120]  Have completely collapsed
[3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:41.120]  Because of their endorsement
[3:55:41.120 --> 3:55:43.120]  Of this entire woke agenda
[3:55:43.120 --> 3:55:45.120]  Disney said we stand in solidarity
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:47.120]  With our LGBTQI
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:49.120]  Plus community everywhere
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:51.120]  They've left out some letters there
[3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:53.120]  Pretty bigoted of them
[3:55:53.120 --> 3:55:55.120]  Haven't included the two spirit people
[3:55:55.120 --> 3:55:57.120]  Or the women
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:55:59.120]  In show of solidarity Disney
[3:55:59.120 --> 3:56:01.120]  Introduces new LGBTQ plus clothing
[3:56:01.120 --> 3:56:03.120]  For young children and babies
[3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  Because
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:07.120]  Inducting children into
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:09.120]  Now whatever you believe about
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:11.120]  The moral aspects of it
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:13.120]  A lifestyle that provably leads
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:15.120]  To mass depression rates
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:17.120]  And suicide
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:19.120]  Of gays transgenders
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:21.120]  Going look up the figures
[3:56:21.120 --> 3:56:23.120]  That's really healthy to promote that
[3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:25.120]  To children isn't it
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:27.120]  Kids shouldn't be exposed to any kind
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:29.120]  Of sexuality whatsoever
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:31.120]  But when they're exposed to the sexuality
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:33.120]  That leads to misery, suicide
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:35.120]  By Disney
[3:56:35.120 --> 3:56:37.120]  A corporation that exists
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:39.120]  To basically entertain children
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:41.120]  To a great extent
[3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:43.120]  No wonder people have a problem with that
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:45.120]  But somebody who did have a problem with LGBT movement
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:47.120]  Because it's so downtrodden and oppressed
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:49.120]  Is a man in Florida
[3:56:49.120 --> 3:56:51.120]  Who did a burnout
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:53.120]  On an LGBT coloured
[3:56:53.120 --> 3:56:55.120]  Crosswalk
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:56:57.120]  Yes, because he offended the woke mob
[3:56:57.120 --> 3:56:59.120]  The LGBT community
[3:56:59.120 --> 3:57:01.120]  Who are so downtrodden and oppressed
[3:57:01.120 --> 3:57:03.120]  Zero hedge reports
[3:57:03.120 --> 3:57:05.120]  Florida judge orders Vandal to write
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:07.120]  25 pages of LGBT fiction
[3:57:07.120 --> 3:57:09.120]  Yes, he has to doth
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:11.120]  His cap, he has to prove
[3:57:11.120 --> 3:57:13.120]  His ideological subservience
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:15.120]  To the agenda because they're so
[3:57:15.120 --> 3:57:17.120]  Downtrodden and oppressed
[3:57:17.120 --> 3:57:19.120]  By writing a LGBT fiction
[3:57:19.120 --> 3:57:21.120]  Based on the false premise
[3:57:21.120 --> 3:57:23.120]  That gay
[3:57:23.120 --> 3:57:25.120]  Pulse nightclub shooter Omar
[3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:27.120]  Matine deliberately targeted
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:29.120]  The LGBT community
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:31.120]  As we know, he didn't
[3:57:31.120 --> 3:57:33.120]  It was a generalized attack
[3:57:33.120 --> 3:57:35.120]  For US military interventions in the Middle East
[3:57:35.120 --> 3:57:37.120]  But now this guy has got to write a complete fiction
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:39.120]  In ideological subservience
[3:57:39.120 --> 3:57:41.120]  Because he dared to a burnout
[3:57:41.120 --> 3:57:43.120]  On a coloured crosswalk, that's it

[3:58:45.120 --> 3:59:05.120]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever kava kava root supplement that is now available at infowarstore.com
[3:59:05.120 --> 3:59:11.120]  According to ancient Samoan legend, kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa
[3:59:11.120 --> 3:59:14.120]  Who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe
[3:59:14.120 --> 3:59:20.120]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little
[3:59:20.120 --> 3:59:25.120]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits
[3:59:25.120 --> 3:59:31.120]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava
[3:59:31.120 --> 3:59:34.120]  But other herbs including but not limited to
[3:59:34.120 --> 3:59:38.120]  German chamomile, organic skullcap, and ballerian root
[3:59:38.120 --> 3:59:41.120]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly
[3:59:41.120 --> 3:59:46.120]  So be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com
