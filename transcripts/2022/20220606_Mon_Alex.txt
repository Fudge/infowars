[00:00.000 --> 00:27.300]  There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[00:27.300 --> 00:31.660]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up.
[00:31.660 --> 00:37.320]  Some say they sacrifice children, and others believe they have magical powers.
[00:37.320 --> 00:40.100]  But the truth is much more simple.
[00:40.100 --> 00:44.920]  Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[00:44.920 --> 00:48.460]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[00:48.460 --> 00:54.620]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow
[00:54.620 --> 00:56.740]  man.
[00:56.740 --> 00:59.620]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[00:59.620 --> 01:05.580]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase pimps
[01:05.580 --> 01:07.340]  and hoes.
[01:07.340 --> 01:10.260]  If these words upset you, good.
[01:10.260 --> 01:13.100]  We are talking about the nature of evil.
[01:13.100 --> 01:15.980]  And if it makes light of it, even better.
[01:15.980 --> 01:18.660]  These animals are nothing to fear.
[01:18.660 --> 01:23.660]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks,
[01:23.660 --> 01:30.100]  they are nothing more than pimps and hoes, cannibals, feeding off other people like predatory
[01:30.100 --> 01:31.100]  animals.
[01:31.100 --> 01:38.300]  Completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love, Satanism is base-level animal tribalism,
[01:38.300 --> 01:44.460]  an animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top, the hoes they control, and the
[01:44.460 --> 01:47.740]  tricks they both exploit.
[01:47.740 --> 01:51.740]  This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia.
[01:51.740 --> 01:59.100]  A survival of the fittest dog-eat-dog world where the nice guys always finish last.
[01:59.100 --> 02:05.660]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense because
[02:05.660 --> 02:11.540]  we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love
[02:11.540 --> 02:14.860]  where everyone is equally welcome.
[02:14.860 --> 02:19.900]  There is much talk about a battle being waged between good and evil, but this sort of simple
[02:19.900 --> 02:24.220]  black and white duality only exists in our mind.
[02:24.220 --> 02:30.780]  In reality, what's going on is a balancing act between our spirit and our body.
[02:30.780 --> 02:36.580]  While our spirit may be drawn to love and light, our body is an animal with innate animal
[02:36.580 --> 02:40.020]  instincts that cannot easily be suppressed.
[02:40.020 --> 02:46.940]  And like every other species of animal, the primary instincts are survival and reproduction.
[02:46.940 --> 02:52.740]  So as far as mammals go, the female is the ultimate prize in the game of life.
[02:52.740 --> 02:59.100]  A society built upon a Christian ethos of brotherly love is one that honors individual
[02:59.100 --> 03:05.060]  freedom and the way to satisfy our animal desires for survival with brotherly love is
[03:05.060 --> 03:10.700]  through marriage and raising a family with some degree of selflessness.
[03:10.700 --> 03:15.900]  And without the Christian ethos of brotherly love, the Satanist simply sees women as the
[03:15.900 --> 03:24.020]  most valued commodity to be bought and sold for one's own selfish desire, pimps and hoes.
[03:24.020 --> 03:28.980]  Whether it be in the poorest communities or at the top of the pyramid, Satanism is all
[03:28.980 --> 03:34.620]  about control and the ones at the top have invested everything into their technocratic
[03:34.620 --> 03:39.180]  pop culture media machine, which is their main method of pimping.
[03:39.180 --> 03:43.940]  And they see the brainwashed masses as their hoes because according to the laws of the
[03:43.940 --> 03:49.740]  jungle, they own them, which is why they resent the Christian ethos because it is the only
[03:49.740 --> 03:53.100]  thing on earth that stands against them.
[03:53.100 --> 03:58.380]  But the real problem with Satanism is that it keeps an individual from knowing God and
[03:58.380 --> 04:00.540]  discovering their true path.
[04:00.540 --> 04:06.940]  Our free will allows us the choice to either transcend spiritually, which requires a personal
[04:06.940 --> 04:14.220]  relationship with God, or descend into the animal kingdom and forever remain a beast,
[04:14.220 --> 04:19.700]  which is what the pimps and hoes are ultimately selling, but we don't have to buy it.
[04:19.700 --> 04:24.460]  Satanic influence has always been with us, and it is nothing to fear.
[04:24.460 --> 04:27.700]  These Satanist pimps are not gods.
[04:27.700 --> 04:32.300]  They are merely animals playing mind tricks and spinning lies.
[04:32.300 --> 04:36.540]  Redemption is for everyone, and humanity has a choice.
[04:36.540 --> 04:42.420]  We can either submit to the beast system and live like animals, or we can follow the Christian
[04:42.420 --> 04:51.300]  impulse for brotherly love and stand up against evil so that our children will know freedom.
[04:51.300 --> 05:01.340]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:01.340 --> 05:05.780]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[05:05.780 --> 05:10.380]  butcher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[05:10.380 --> 05:11.380]  profiles.
[05:11.380 --> 05:12.380]  You see it every year.
[05:12.380 --> 05:17.300]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[05:17.300 --> 05:23.100]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[05:23.100 --> 05:26.500]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[05:26.500 --> 05:27.500]  this and knowing this.
[05:27.500 --> 05:33.100]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[05:33.100 --> 05:36.140]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[05:36.140 --> 05:38.660]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[05:38.660 --> 05:44.100]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[05:44.100 --> 05:51.260]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[05:51.260 --> 06:10.940]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[06:10.940 --> 06:31.900]  It's Monday, June 6, 2022, I'm your host, Alex Jones, here on the Unvattled Infowars
[06:31.900 --> 06:39.940]  Radio Slash TV Worldwide Network, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, ATX.
[06:39.940 --> 06:48.180]  All right, most people don't realize they're living through extremely historical events
[06:48.180 --> 06:51.180]  until it's already happened.
[06:51.180 --> 06:55.340]  And I am not a doom and gloomer, I have incredible optimism in humanity, I believe in humanity's
[06:55.340 --> 06:59.700]  future, I believe we'll colonize space, I believe we will continue to unlock secrets
[06:59.700 --> 07:03.300]  in the universe, God has prepared that for us, and I believe in you, and I believe in
[07:03.300 --> 07:09.540]  myself, and I believe in my family, and I most importantly know God's real.
[07:09.540 --> 07:13.860]  The science has shown that there are other dimensions more powerful energetically than
[07:13.860 --> 07:18.780]  our own, holding our dimension in place, the higher dimensions are there as the mathematical
[07:18.780 --> 07:27.180]  equations show, and there are evil influences in the universe as well, not just the impetus
[07:27.180 --> 07:30.220]  of Genesis and life.
[07:30.220 --> 07:36.860]  So let me just state this very calmly in a very controlled way, we know from history,
[07:36.860 --> 07:43.220]  we know from the Bible, we know from every other ancient text as well in every culture
[07:43.220 --> 07:50.820]  that humanity goes through cycles of death and rebirth, and everybody's seen the meme
[07:50.820 --> 08:01.660]  that says, hard times make strong men, strong men make good times, good times make weak
[08:01.660 --> 08:13.020]  men, weak men make bad times, or you can reverse it, weak men make bad times, bad times make
[08:13.020 --> 08:19.580]  good men, good men make good times, and good times make bad men, that's a simple way to
[08:19.580 --> 08:25.180]  go over the cycle, but it is a known cycle that humans have behaved in this way over
[08:25.180 --> 08:31.380]  and over again, and at the end of the cycle what always happens, people start cheating
[08:31.380 --> 08:36.580]  on their husbands and wives, then people start having sex with the same sex, I'm not even
[08:36.580 --> 08:43.540]  judging people that do that as a person, I'm just saying this is historical, and then they
[08:43.540 --> 08:48.060]  come at their children and want to have sex with them, and I am 100% against that, and
[08:48.060 --> 08:52.980]  then they want to start sacrificing the children.
[08:52.980 --> 09:02.220]  Well we're here, ladies and gentlemen, and at a gay strip bar in Dallas this weekend
[09:02.220 --> 09:06.940]  with a big neon sign saying it's not going to lick itself behind little children and
[09:06.940 --> 09:12.060]  all sorts of other pornographic statements, children as young as 3 years old were brought
[09:12.060 --> 09:23.900]  in and paraded around like Roman standards that have been captured by these sickos, but
[09:23.900 --> 09:27.940]  what's really important is this isn't some bottom feeding organization that just climbed
[09:27.940 --> 09:33.780]  up out of the muck by itself, it has the full corporate backing of the most powerful corporations
[09:33.780 --> 09:40.420]  and individuals on the planet other than people like Elon Musk, and I haven't seen Peter Teal
[09:40.420 --> 09:45.060]  pushing the stuff, but by and large it's a cult, and I've got a whole stack of news
[09:45.060 --> 09:50.700]  on that today, and it's the signpost that you're entering hell, hell it's the signpost
[09:50.700 --> 09:53.620]  that you're in hell.
[09:53.620 --> 09:58.260]  Now we've got that going on, and with it comes the economic degradation, with it comes the
[09:58.260 --> 10:02.540]  inflation of the currency, everything that brought down the Roman Empire, everything
[10:02.540 --> 10:06.860]  that brought down Venezuela, everything that brought down Chile, everything that brought
[10:06.860 --> 10:15.100]  down Weimar Germany, it's an exact path, and we know the path we're going down.
[10:15.100 --> 10:20.140]  And Weimar Germany brought us Hitler in World War II, Venezuela was the richest country
[10:20.140 --> 10:25.940]  in Latin America, the average citizen had more money 50 years ago than the average American
[10:25.940 --> 10:32.020]  citizen, same thing for Chile, but they got bad governments that inflated their currency
[10:32.020 --> 10:37.180]  and those elites over the few decades it took to devalue the currency and buy up all the
[10:37.180 --> 10:43.860]  infrastructure for themselves, then permanently put the general public into a permanent class
[10:43.860 --> 10:49.740]  of poor people, that's called feudalism, and it's an economic warfare operation.
[10:49.740 --> 10:54.380]  And I have a stack of financial news today where the billionaires of the planet are all
[10:54.380 --> 10:59.580]  making record profits and on spending sprees buying up infrastructure and intellectual
[10:59.580 --> 11:04.140]  property and art and everything else, while the general public during inflation pulls
[11:04.140 --> 11:09.980]  back, it's a total consolidation of everything.
[11:09.980 --> 11:16.780]  And then we've got parades of Biden administration officials telling us that Biden and the globalist
[11:16.780 --> 11:26.540]  policies of issuing tens of trillions of dollars in stimulus packages and other packages for
[11:26.540 --> 11:31.660]  COVID that they gave to themselves, money laundering, they're saying that has nothing
[11:31.660 --> 11:33.980]  to do with the current situation we're in.
[11:33.980 --> 11:40.900]  The good news is national polls show over 90% know it's the big banks and they know Biden's
[11:40.900 --> 11:46.860]  a puppet because as much as I enjoy at a beast fuel level watching Biden's squirm and he's
[11:46.860 --> 11:54.020]  figured out it's in the news that he's hated and doesn't like it, you delusional pedophile,
[11:54.020 --> 12:00.780]  you bumbling idiot, you were put there because you're a slug and because you were dumb enough
[12:00.780 --> 12:05.260]  to take the job when they're going to bring America down, so you and your stinking family
[12:05.260 --> 12:06.260]  will get the blame.
[12:06.260 --> 12:10.900]  And I want you and your disgusting family to burn in hell.
[12:10.900 --> 12:15.900]  But I don't want you to be the scapegoat for the real powers behind the throne that
[12:15.900 --> 12:20.820]  have implemented every stinking bit of this.
[12:20.820 --> 12:27.380]  So that's where we are today, ladies and gentlemen, and I can tell you that the average business
[12:27.380 --> 12:30.500]  person I know is on the verge of bankruptcy.
[12:30.500 --> 12:37.100]  I can tell you with cost increases and inflation, we are barely in the black despite me begging
[12:37.100 --> 12:41.300]  and pleading and I appreciate you coming through, but everybody's got an amazing audience like
[12:41.300 --> 12:43.540]  we have or the special mission we have.
[12:43.540 --> 12:48.940]  So I'm going to go over all this news when we come back, not to be gloom and doom, but
[12:48.940 --> 12:55.180]  to be honest with everybody about how bad it is and how bad it's going to get.
[12:55.180 --> 13:01.140]  And we have to cover this or we're going to all be caught flat footed and that means
[13:01.140 --> 13:03.140]  myself included.
[13:03.140 --> 13:10.020]  I've been so busy trying to stop this that I personally have exhausted my resources and
[13:10.020 --> 13:15.860]  I have not spent almost any time myself getting ready for what's about to go down.
[13:15.860 --> 13:24.860]  My parents have and I appreciate them doing that, but most people don't have property,
[13:24.860 --> 13:28.660]  most people don't have a trailer to live on, most people don't have solar power, most people
[13:28.660 --> 13:34.020]  don't have the little bit of things I've got.
[13:34.020 --> 13:39.820]  And when the EBT guards will still issue the money in the future, but when it doesn't buy
[13:39.820 --> 13:46.060]  the products and it doesn't buy the cigarettes and the alcohol and the baby formula isn't
[13:46.060 --> 13:54.060]  even on the shelves and then these urban food deserts, folks can't get their Twinkies and
[13:54.060 --> 13:58.380]  their hot pockets, the cities are going to burn.
[13:58.380 --> 14:02.300]  And this is all the IMF World Bank documents that came out in 2002, it's in my book to
[14:02.300 --> 14:03.300]  send to tyranny.
[14:03.300 --> 14:07.460]  Greg Powell did a great job on BBC with the documents he got and they cynically have
[14:07.460 --> 14:12.380]  a 100 part plan and at the end they cause food riots in third world countries and the
[14:12.380 --> 14:17.020]  collapse and then buy everything up for pennies on the dollar with the inflated currency that
[14:17.020 --> 14:19.380]  they control.
[14:19.380 --> 14:23.380]  But they got to get you bankrupt and destitute before they can be positioned to actually carry
[14:23.380 --> 14:24.380]  that out.
[14:24.380 --> 14:29.780]  And they talk about the documents that I harped on so much that now in the next few decades
[14:29.780 --> 14:34.980]  they would do it to Western industrialized nations and they bragged because it'll be
[14:34.980 --> 14:40.380]  good for the earth and there was a New York Times article on Friday bragging saying the
[14:40.380 --> 14:45.580]  worldwide collapse is good for the earth and I read you quotes and showed you the videos
[14:45.580 --> 14:51.380]  yesterday where the Davos group is saying lockdowns and collapse are good.
[14:51.380 --> 14:55.060]  They're using the lockdowns to accelerate the collapse then they're going to turn around
[14:55.060 --> 15:03.460]  and blame the virus as the White House is already doing for the economic policies that
[15:03.460 --> 15:07.180]  accelerated the collapse of the third world.
[15:07.180 --> 15:12.060]  Now the UN organizing those populations to flood us as a political weapon is an economic
[15:12.060 --> 15:15.780]  and cultural weapon and we now see it.
[15:15.780 --> 15:19.780]  Not because it's down the street or 10 feet in front of us it's on top of us punching
[15:19.780 --> 15:22.620]  us in the nose.
[15:22.620 --> 15:28.140]  And now it's pulling out a knife to stab us and so Congress still sits there twiddling
[15:28.140 --> 15:29.140]  their thumbs.
[15:29.140 --> 15:33.780]  The Republican Party is so adult and so controlled got a stack of news here where they're trying
[15:33.780 --> 15:36.220]  to help Biden pass a bunch of gun control.
[15:36.220 --> 15:39.900]  Even though Biden has the lowest approval rating of any history in any president history
[15:39.900 --> 15:44.580]  the Republican instinct is to go along with this and stab us in the back.

[20:46.580 --> 20:52.820]  us in a fight there's nothing i want to do more than beat the globalists and get them
[20:52.820 --> 20:59.540]  off our back there's nothing i want to do more than stay in this fight and i can't do
[20:59.540 --> 21:05.860]  that without you and that's why when you call in and thank me i just say stop it right there
[21:06.420 --> 21:09.220]  the fact that you're listening the fact that you're calling the fact that you're spreading
[21:09.220 --> 21:15.060]  the word the fact that you're supporting us together in this fight is incredible i want
[21:15.060 --> 21:22.820]  to thank you and when i say that i get chills those aren't words i hate these devil worship and
[21:22.820 --> 21:30.420]  pedophiles every cell in my body wants to get them off our children and i can't do it without you
[21:30.420 --> 21:37.140]  and you can't do it without me we can't do it without god but together we can do anything

[21:42.260 --> 21:48.100]  and it's all out in the open and the mask is off is because the devil sends the beast with
[21:48.100 --> 21:54.420]  wrath because he knows his time is short let he who have understanding reckon the number of the beast
[21:56.100 --> 22:03.540]  for it is the number of a man 666 someone hit this economic news this all ties together
[22:05.380 --> 22:08.980]  the most important work in four wars has ever done is down here and i want to thank you for
[22:08.980 --> 22:14.100]  sponsoring us we don't have the george soros is in the world funding us we have people like you
[22:14.100 --> 22:19.300]  i've never had big donors without the big donors that came in we would be in the red worse than i
[22:19.300 --> 22:24.820]  thought and we'd be having to lay off half our crew as we speak this month but some folks came
[22:24.820 --> 22:30.180]  through and literally sustained us but i don't want to get into the red again plus i've got products
[22:30.180 --> 22:36.100]  you need we've got less than 10 percent of the coins left an info or store dot com there's a link

[27:46.580 --> 27:53.220]  unbelievable and i'm not going to even go over all the lies it's just it's staggering but i mean
[27:53.220 --> 27:58.260]  here's an example last week hundreds of publications reuters ap new york times washington post
[27:58.260 --> 28:04.180]  and basically every hundreds that i saw said jones thrown out of bankruptcy court by the
[28:04.180 --> 28:08.820]  justice department for being a criminal and it's a huge victory for the sandy hook parents
[28:09.780 --> 28:17.780]  they dropped their lawsuits against info wars and against our key real companies saying they were fake
[28:20.260 --> 28:24.500]  and it's a devastating victory for the truth and everything they're still
[28:24.500 --> 28:29.700]  still suing free speech systems and that's ongoing but i'm not going to give you the inside baseball
[28:29.700 --> 28:37.620]  but i'm going to leave it at that the point is is that they're at the table right now
[28:39.300 --> 28:45.140]  and then you look at the news oh alex jones and the the justice department they dropped their
[28:45.140 --> 28:50.580]  lawsuits against info wars and three other companies info wars health and so we dropped
[28:50.580 --> 28:56.180]  the the the bankruptcy total victory and then they they spent it that i'm a criminal and the doj
[28:56.180 --> 29:04.900]  made them drop it the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alex jones was right
[29:04.900 --> 29:09.460]  people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling because
[29:09.460 --> 29:15.780]  i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going to become
[29:15.780 --> 29:22.580]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents
[29:22.580 --> 29:29.220]  it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the bilderberg group

[33:37.140 --> 33:46.500]  i help the blind to see i got no friends because they read the papers they can't be seen
[33:47.620 --> 33:58.020]  with me and i'm getting real shocked at me feeling me all right no more i want to hit all this
[33:58.020 --> 34:02.020]  economic news and the second amendment news and the russian news everything here in a moment but i
[34:02.020 --> 34:06.660]  want to go back to this bankruptcy thing because look alex jones and being under leptis attack
[34:06.660 --> 34:10.420]  and george soros funded law firms everybody already knows that that's old news and i don't
[34:10.420 --> 34:17.300]  want to hear about it i know you don't want to hear about it but the illustration of how delusional
[34:18.340 --> 34:24.740]  the democratic party is and how they're in control of all these attacks on us i told you
[34:25.780 --> 34:32.500]  a month ago before it hit the news that for the first time ever that these and i've hired
[34:32.500 --> 34:36.820]  top bankruptcy lawyers in the state of texas respected people that have done you know like
[34:37.460 --> 34:44.100]  texaco and you know top oil company stuff big national cases known straight lace respected
[34:44.660 --> 34:51.540]  absolutely impeccable records they've never heard of the justice department calling up and saying
[34:51.540 --> 34:57.300]  you're not to give alex jones access to the courts they called the judges up they called the trustees
[34:57.300 --> 35:04.340]  up and said alex jones doesn't get access to bankruptcy courts this comes from the president
[35:08.660 --> 35:16.340]  and then the justice department told the sandy hook democrat lawyers drop these cases against
[35:16.340 --> 35:22.660]  jones these aren't real companies and then they dropped the lawsuits against info wars and and
[35:22.660 --> 35:28.900]  almost all our companies now they can never go after me i mean again they just say i'm a villain
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.380]  they say i'm a fraud i went into bankruptcy to show them how much money i've got so that they
[35:33.380 --> 35:38.340]  will leave me alone and know that i don't have hardly any money they put all these lies on tv i've
[35:38.340 --> 35:46.500]  got hundreds of millions of dollars i don't have two million dollars myself the company was insolvent
[35:46.500 --> 35:54.340]  till donations came in we're still barely in the black and and and and imagine the craziness
[35:56.260 --> 36:00.100]  of my lawyers saying well don't talk about it yet because nobody's going to believe it
[36:00.100 --> 36:05.460]  but the justice department just called up the former head bankruptcy judge in austin
[36:07.060 --> 36:08.340]  that was one of the trustees
[36:08.340 --> 36:20.260]  totally impartial that's how that these things work a democrat and told their lawyer you are not
[36:20.260 --> 36:26.100]  to be involved with jones and you are not to give him access to courts they said well you
[36:26.100 --> 36:29.540]  have no standing to say that they said well it's a policy decision from biden
[36:31.300 --> 36:37.220]  now imagine that and then i came on air and i said i told my lawyers said i don't care i'm
[36:37.220 --> 36:41.300]  going to talk about it i'm going to be very basic the justice department head of the
[36:42.740 --> 36:48.420]  national trustee office for federal bankruptcy over the whole country that that never gets
[36:48.420 --> 36:55.060]  involved in in any of the stuff directly calling up people saying he doesn't get access to the courts
[36:57.220 --> 37:04.580]  and then saying it's a fraud the the the doj was then all over the news a month ago you saw it
[37:04.580 --> 37:12.340]  saying jones has filed sinister fraud they didn't look at the bankruptcy they didn't look at the
[37:12.340 --> 37:19.460]  books it never even got to that point they just said it's a fraud and then the sandy hook democrat
[37:19.460 --> 37:27.300]  party law firms in texas and canada get they're all coordinated drop their lawsuits against four
[37:27.300 --> 37:35.940]  of our key companies that makes up like 70 percent of info wars the info wars website all of it
[37:38.260 --> 37:44.980]  i mean is the info wars website a fraud is it not part of our most important asset
[37:46.260 --> 37:51.860]  so again these people are crazy i mean that's all i'm telling you folks is they have decided
[37:51.860 --> 37:57.460]  we're hitler they believe whatever they spew out of their mouths and what they are is like fiction
[37:57.460 --> 38:03.300]  writers but they're crazy people because if you've ever been around crazy people they will really
[38:03.300 --> 38:13.060]  believe whatever it is they think whatever it is pops into their brains and that is the mental
[38:13.060 --> 38:20.260]  illness of crazy people that is that is the bizarreness of these and so just understand folks
[38:20.260 --> 38:25.700]  that's who runs the country that's who i mean we literally come to the table and go here's everything
[38:26.420 --> 38:30.660]  you say we're already guilty without a jury trial okay we don't have a lot of extra money
[38:31.220 --> 38:38.820]  so under law here come come look with the federal judges i'd go to jail if i lie about anything
[38:38.820 --> 38:42.660]  come check everything and stop lying about us and they go no we don't want that
[38:42.660 --> 38:49.700]  we want a show trial two in texas
[38:53.220 --> 38:58.020]  and one in connecticut starting this summer into the midterm and they even admit they've
[38:58.020 --> 39:02.340]  hired hbo and netflix and and we go to the hearings and the judges are putting makeup on
[39:02.340 --> 39:06.820]  and being mic'd up and oh and they're all getting up there and they want three johnny depth style
[39:06.820 --> 39:13.460]  trials and that's all they care about so i don't think the justice department is stupid
[39:14.260 --> 39:20.900]  or crazy maybe they are maybe it's just they just don't care and they just want their show trials
[39:22.340 --> 39:27.780]  so that's the type of people that are in control of the nation and they're running into the ground
[39:27.780 --> 39:35.540]  and now they've hired a former top network tv drama producer you know people that produce
[39:35.540 --> 39:46.020]  top shows and court shows to put on the january 6 event and then we see what the so-called witnesses
[39:46.020 --> 39:52.100]  told them we see the statements they put out the january 6 committee says we've got mark meadows
[39:52.660 --> 39:58.180]  and roger stone and alex jones all coordinating never talked to mark meadows roger stone never
[39:58.180 --> 40:06.340]  talked to mark meadows ever roger stone wasn't involved in any of the planning i was involved
[40:06.340 --> 40:11.700]  in planning a peaceful rallies but though the january 6 committee is going to have hearings
[40:11.700 --> 40:23.140]  did trump gave the orders and look look i know you know they lie but i mean folks these people
[40:23.140 --> 40:32.100]  are out of their minds and they're running the country and they're running the nuclear weapons
[40:32.740 --> 40:38.020]  and there's an old saying you can't con an honest man because they don't think like a con artist
[40:38.740 --> 40:44.740]  and it's true these people have smoked their own dope they've gotten high on their own supply
[40:45.380 --> 40:52.100]  they have drank their own kool-aid and i don't even when i was younger i hated the globalist and i
[40:52.100 --> 40:56.420]  still hate him some but i was driven mainly by hate not by partially by love but the hate was
[40:56.420 --> 41:00.100]  the majority of my drive and that's wrong and i've learned i'm not do that the last few years
[41:00.100 --> 41:05.380]  i've grown up a lot but i really don't even hate these people they're pathetic they're nuts
[41:06.020 --> 41:14.100]  you feel sorry for them and you just wonder like what is it like to be them getting up on tv at
[41:14.100 --> 41:18.500]  press conferences and saying we have nothing to do with inflation there's plenty of baby formula
[41:18.500 --> 41:24.100]  there is no inflation they said last year now oh inflation's good oh inflation's real it's
[41:24.100 --> 41:29.300]  putin's fault and you just sit back and you watch them change their stance day to day
[41:29.300 --> 41:36.660]  week after week month after month and they're just jokes they're a bunch of crazy freaks
[41:39.140 --> 41:40.020]  that we have let
[41:40.020 --> 41:50.100]  take control of our lives these people can't run their own lives statistically they their children
[41:50.100 --> 41:54.100]  commit the most suicide during drug rehabs constantly i'm not people that are but but
[41:54.100 --> 41:59.620]  they're just mental patients the wiki leaks came out and it was all these top democrat
[41:59.620 --> 42:08.900]  strategists the podestas and others with hillary doing philema or allister crowley magic oh my
[42:08.900 --> 42:13.140]  wife's really sick we're all going to get together they say in the in the emails and we're going to
[42:13.140 --> 42:25.620]  do a philema ritual they're following a loser allister crowley but you know who's really pathetic us
[42:27.220 --> 42:33.380]  because we step back and let these criminals run everything when they're devil worshiping
[42:33.380 --> 42:40.020]  i mean do you i mean really at the end of the day the people running things are devil worshiper
[42:40.020 --> 42:44.740]  pedophiles and now they're externalizing who they are to all of us because they've been caught
[42:44.740 --> 42:48.740]  and they're like you know what we are pedophiles we are devil worshipers get used to it by the way
[42:48.740 --> 42:53.700]  you're going to eat bugs you're going to drink sewage you know what i got an idea how about you

[43:06.980 --> 43:11.860]  money magazine have all done these profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30
[43:11.860 --> 43:17.780]  different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[43:17.780 --> 43:22.420]  screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[43:22.420 --> 43:27.220]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show it's a very important
[43:27.220 --> 43:33.700]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things
[43:33.700 --> 43:38.020]  tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here
[43:38.020 --> 43:44.900]  if i hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years the only way you fail is not writing

[46:08.340 --> 46:12.940]  caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[46:12.940 --> 46:14.940]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[46:58.940 --> 47:05.940]  Thank you.
[47:58.940 --> 48:07.260]  You know, if you want to think about who the Democrats are, they're all a bunch of avanades.
[48:07.260 --> 48:11.860]  Just delusional, crazy crooks that can't even run their own lives.
[48:11.860 --> 48:16.540]  Just running around trying to see who they can push around, who they can lie about.
[48:16.540 --> 48:20.020]  They got the whole corporate media and big tech ganged up against the people and they
[48:20.020 --> 48:25.220]  thought long term that would win.
[48:25.220 --> 48:26.220]  They're a joke.
[48:26.220 --> 48:31.220]  All right, here's the deal.
[48:31.220 --> 48:36.540]  We're going to open the phones up on the economy and on where you think it's all going and
[48:36.540 --> 48:40.820]  more at the bottom of the next hour, take an hour and a half calls here today.
[48:40.820 --> 48:49.820]  And I didn't intend to go off on a big tirade, a jag about the Justice Department and the
[48:49.820 --> 48:51.140]  stuff they do.
[48:51.140 --> 48:58.620]  To me, you can pull it up, thousands of articles in the last few months, Jones is a fraud, Jones
[48:58.620 --> 49:04.020]  has filed a criminal bankruptcy, Jones, never looking at one document, none of it ever even
[49:04.020 --> 49:07.380]  got entered in, never got to that point.
[49:07.380 --> 49:09.820]  They're supposed to be a deliberate to body.
[49:09.820 --> 49:11.220]  They're supposed to get evidence.
[49:11.220 --> 49:14.580]  They're supposed to actually know what they're talking about.
[49:14.580 --> 49:19.740]  And then again, they spoke their own dope and drop all their challenges against our
[49:19.740 --> 49:27.540]  main companies saying it's a fraud because you see, they think I'm like them.
[49:27.540 --> 49:32.540]  They think everything comes out of my mouth is a lie like them.
[49:32.540 --> 49:41.740]  When everything I do is to strive to be as accurate as I can because I believe that's
[49:41.740 --> 49:44.220]  the currency people want is truth.
[49:44.220 --> 49:46.060]  I don't want to hang around with people.
[49:46.060 --> 49:47.420]  I don't want to listen to people.
[49:47.420 --> 49:51.020]  I don't want to know people that I can't turn my back on.
[49:51.020 --> 49:55.660]  I want to find people in my life that I know if I call them at 3am will come to my aid
[49:55.660 --> 49:56.820]  and I'll come to their aid.
[49:56.820 --> 50:01.580]  I want to be around people that I know are good and decent like my family.
[50:01.580 --> 50:07.260]  But you see, these leftists are so divorced from God, they don't even know there's good
[50:07.260 --> 50:08.900]  people.
[50:08.900 --> 50:12.980]  They literally think we're like them.
[50:12.980 --> 50:13.980]  And guess what?
[50:13.980 --> 50:14.980]  Losers.
[50:14.980 --> 50:15.980]  We're not.
[50:15.980 --> 50:17.380]  We're good.
[50:17.380 --> 50:23.100]  And it doesn't matter how many lies you spew or what crap you put out, the listeners and
[50:23.100 --> 50:27.300]  there's millions and millions every day and millions more every week, they tune in here
[50:27.300 --> 50:32.500]  because they know they're getting their best shot at accurate analysis and when I'm wrong,
[50:32.500 --> 50:38.740]  I'll tell you because I want you to know it because I want to get better.
[50:38.740 --> 50:41.820]  And that's really the difference.
[50:41.820 --> 50:45.740]  These people just think up the biggest lies they can and think about how do they deceive
[50:45.740 --> 50:47.700]  people and how do they screw people?
[50:47.700 --> 50:49.740]  I don't want to live in a world like that.
[50:49.740 --> 50:51.420]  I have children.
[50:51.420 --> 50:53.660]  You think I want to go around screwing people?
[50:53.660 --> 50:54.660]  You think I want?
[50:54.660 --> 50:57.500]  You don't think I don't know karma is real.
[50:57.500 --> 51:02.940]  You reap what you sow because I've done things unintentionally bad in my life and it came
[51:02.940 --> 51:03.980]  back on me.
[51:03.980 --> 51:05.740]  I'm scared to do bad.
[51:05.740 --> 51:07.620]  It's not like I want to do bad either.
[51:07.620 --> 51:11.980]  I morally don't want to do bad, but I'm scared to mess up.
[51:11.980 --> 51:17.380]  And that's why we're so different from these people is I'm scared I'm going to get pissed
[51:17.380 --> 51:19.940]  and bash somebody's brains up.
[51:19.940 --> 51:24.300]  I know I have weaknesses.
[51:24.300 --> 51:26.660]  I know I'm a lustful person.
[51:26.660 --> 51:30.980]  I got to keep that under control.
[51:30.980 --> 51:35.620]  And I know when I get under pressure, my mind will twist things sometimes and convince me
[51:35.620 --> 51:37.700]  that doing bad things is moral.
[51:37.700 --> 51:42.660]  When I was younger, I couldn't control that and made a lot of mistakes.
[51:42.660 --> 51:43.660]  I make far fewer now.
[51:43.660 --> 51:49.060]  But the reason I'm talking about this journey I'm on, you're on, we're on is because it's
[51:49.060 --> 51:56.060]  a journey people serving evil need to understand why they're so unhappy and that doing more
[51:56.060 --> 52:03.180]  and more bad telling bigger and bigger lies is not going to help you in the future.
[52:03.180 --> 52:07.940]  Don't you globalist leftist and minions of the system want truth?
[52:07.940 --> 52:09.060]  Don't you hunger after it?
[52:09.060 --> 52:11.820]  Don't you want to know the secrets of the universe?
[52:11.820 --> 52:12.820]  That's truth.
[52:12.820 --> 52:15.300]  Don't you want to really know who you are?
[52:15.300 --> 52:20.740]  Don't you really want to be around good people you can trust?
[52:20.740 --> 52:23.740]  Such a satisfying thing to have people I can trust.
[52:23.740 --> 52:26.780]  You know, I've had great crews in the last 28 years.
[52:26.780 --> 52:28.780]  Back 28 years ago, it was only two or three people.
[52:28.780 --> 52:30.860]  Today, it's close to 100.
[52:30.860 --> 52:35.940]  I can tell you I trust every member of this crew and I know they're good souls and that
[52:35.940 --> 52:43.500]  is such wealth to know that I've got people like panning for gold all these years in this
[52:43.500 --> 52:48.660]  river that we have got these nuggets of gold here of the Info Wars operation.
[52:48.660 --> 52:55.980]  And then I think about those nuggets of gold and I look out at you and I see seas of gold.
[52:55.980 --> 53:00.900]  I just see incredible, honorable people.
[53:00.900 --> 53:02.140]  I'm willing to go to prison.
[53:02.140 --> 53:03.420]  I'm willing to be executed.
[53:03.420 --> 53:04.580]  I'm willing to die.
[53:04.580 --> 53:10.220]  I'm willing to be tortured because it's a blessing to meet you on the street and I look
[53:10.220 --> 53:11.220]  into your eyes.
[53:11.220 --> 53:12.220]  You could be brown.
[53:12.220 --> 53:13.220]  You could be black.
[53:13.220 --> 53:14.220]  You could be pink.
[53:14.220 --> 53:19.100]  I guess there are some white people, few white folks are actually white.
[53:19.100 --> 53:22.660]  Most of us are pink, little geckos or something.
[53:22.660 --> 53:29.940]  But the point is, is that when I see the fire in a black woman's eyes that loves liberty
[53:29.940 --> 53:40.580]  or a white woman's eyes or a brown man's eyes, I see God and it's like that line with Robert
[53:40.580 --> 53:48.620]  Duvall in the incredible nightmare film based on the incredible book The Road of Viggo Mortensen
[53:48.620 --> 53:53.460]  in this desolate world, 90-plus percent population reduction, total collapse of civilization.
[53:53.460 --> 54:00.100]  They're having a campfire and Robert Duvall says, that boy of yours, that's God.
[54:00.100 --> 54:03.380]  Not he's God, but that's God living in there.
[54:03.380 --> 54:04.500]  That's the future.
[54:04.500 --> 54:05.500]  That's the children.
[54:05.500 --> 54:07.020]  That's everything good.
[54:07.020 --> 54:11.980]  That's what we should be standing up for.
[54:11.980 --> 54:13.740]  Great job, the crew, finding that in five seconds.
[54:13.740 --> 54:15.740]  Man, they're fast.
[54:15.740 --> 54:20.740]  In fact, maybe you can find that with audio and we'll play that clip if you can get it.
[54:20.740 --> 54:23.700]  Let me know when you got it.
[54:23.700 --> 54:29.980]  And so when I see these hordes of empty wraiths, these ghosts, these zombies, these taking
[54:29.980 --> 54:35.100]  over individuals, lusting after our children's innocent, lusting after their bodies, lusting
[54:35.100 --> 54:40.860]  after their energy, it's because they are so incredibly empty.
[54:40.860 --> 54:48.740]  And they think finally, if they can just corrupt children and their future and wreck them,
[54:48.740 --> 54:52.900]  that then they would finally be fulfilled and that's the lie of evil, is it gets control
[54:52.900 --> 55:01.060]  of you, it takes over your life, and then it demands more and more and more until you
[55:01.060 --> 55:06.220]  have nothing.
[55:06.220 --> 55:12.940]  In these drag queen pedo time events with big giant red neon letters of your radio
[55:12.940 --> 55:20.140]  listener, you don't see it behind them saying it's not going to lick itself and all the
[55:20.140 --> 55:29.020]  festooned posters in the debauchery bar of men doing all sorts of crazy stuff to each
[55:29.020 --> 55:30.900]  other.
[55:30.900 --> 55:33.220]  And then they march a bunch of children in there.
[55:33.220 --> 55:34.220]  Can you imagine?
[55:34.220 --> 55:38.260]  I've been to plenty of topless bars in my life, hadn't been to one in a long time.
[55:38.260 --> 55:41.940]  And still women are being exploited, they're exploiting you and the whole thing's seedy.
[55:41.940 --> 55:46.940]  But it's adults, adults can do that if they want.
[55:46.940 --> 55:52.260]  And imagine if you were at a topless bar at midnight on a Friday night and they marched
[55:52.260 --> 55:58.060]  a six year old girl or boy up on the stage and people started throwing money at them,
[55:58.060 --> 56:05.820]  you would flip out, you'd call the police, but when it's done at the sex bars with children
[56:05.820 --> 56:12.700]  in Dallas, Texas, and the children, we got video of it, are giving them money offerings
[56:12.700 --> 56:16.660]  under this.
[56:16.660 --> 56:21.260]  Not a damn thing said in the corporate media and it's sick and it's evil.
[56:21.260 --> 56:26.700]  If I was at a topless bar, like Joe Rogan and I used to go to him all the time decades
[56:26.700 --> 56:35.900]  ago, not name dropping, I used to go with a lot, he was in comedy clubs every month
[56:35.900 --> 56:40.300]  or so in Texas, we hang out in Houston, Austin, you name it.
[56:40.300 --> 56:44.380]  And I guarantee you, if I was in a topless bar and I saw them march a five year old
[56:44.380 --> 56:49.740]  girl up on stage and people start giving them money, I'd call the police and I'd stand
[56:49.740 --> 56:50.740]  up and say, this is wrong.
[56:50.740 --> 56:53.540]  And if some bouncer got in my face, I'm not calling for violence.
[56:53.540 --> 56:54.700]  I'm telling you what happened.
[56:54.700 --> 56:58.700]  That bouncer would get their job broken just like that.
[56:58.700 --> 57:02.020]  But you know, there's not bouncers at topless bars that want to march five year old kids
[57:02.020 --> 57:03.020]  up on stage.
[57:03.020 --> 57:08.020]  Hell, people on death row don't want that, but this is done out in the open in front
[57:08.020 --> 57:16.220]  of everybody pissing on our children and celebrating them like trophies that these sick, evil demons
[57:16.220 --> 57:20.100]  have captured and it's wrong.
[57:20.100 --> 57:22.020]  Even Bill Maher's come out against it.
[57:22.020 --> 57:23.460]  Where's your line in the sand?
[57:23.460 --> 57:24.820]  How far will you go?
[57:24.820 --> 57:26.500]  Did you think about where we are today?
[57:26.500 --> 57:29.300]  Will we be in a year, two years, three years, you know where?
[57:29.300 --> 57:33.260]  Hell, open pedophilia is already being pushed by the New York Times, the Washington Post
[57:33.260 --> 57:34.260]  everywhere.
[57:34.260 --> 57:37.820]  Headlines like take your kids to a gay parade.
[57:37.820 --> 57:38.820]  The kink is good.
[57:38.820 --> 57:41.740]  They're having sex in the street.
[57:41.740 --> 57:44.580]  This is a pedophile cult that wants us to sell our soul.
[57:44.580 --> 57:45.580]  Well, guess what?
[57:45.580 --> 57:46.580]  It ain't for sale.
[57:46.580 --> 57:54.380]  I want to take a minute out to address the viewers and listeners of Info Wars and to
[57:54.380 --> 57:59.060]  remind you that we've been vindicated and that world government and its tyrannical
[57:59.060 --> 58:02.900]  aim of depopulation is now out of the open.
[58:02.900 --> 58:07.580]  Everything you and I have done together has been historic and we cannot continue in this
[58:07.580 --> 58:09.380]  fight without your support.
[58:09.380 --> 58:13.540]  I want to encourage you all to be part of history right now while you still can to get
[58:13.540 --> 58:19.220]  your third and final coin in the founding member coin series, the come and take it free
[58:19.220 --> 58:23.220]  men bear arms coins at 1776coin.com.
[58:23.220 --> 58:29.020]  In just a few days, this coin will be gone forever and you will have the coin in your
[58:29.020 --> 58:35.340]  possession and know you helped Info War stay on air at the most critical time in our 28
[58:35.340 --> 58:36.340]  year history.
[58:36.340 --> 58:39.580]  So I want to thank you all for your support and I want to encourage you all to be part
[58:39.580 --> 58:47.900]  of history and to get this historic momento keeps us on air at infowarstore.com or 1776coin.com
[58:47.900 --> 58:49.780]  while you still can.
[58:49.780 --> 58:54.740]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones, needs to support Info Wars and
[58:54.740 --> 58:55.740]  band.video.
[58:55.740 --> 58:58.500]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[58:58.500 --> 58:59.860]  I'm going to do that right now.
[58:59.860 --> 59:03.820]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[59:03.820 --> 59:09.020]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[59:09.020 --> 59:13.860]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad, the outer space because of Alex Jones
[59:13.860 --> 59:14.860]  including myself.
[59:14.860 --> 59:19.620]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform and
[59:19.620 --> 59:23.660]  I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[59:23.660 --> 59:28.460]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass, the super
[59:28.460 --> 59:29.460]  Tim Cass IRL.
[59:29.460 --> 59:35.460]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band.video for granted because you
[59:35.460 --> 59:37.660]  don't know what you have until it's gone.
[59:37.660 --> 59:42.380]  We need to support free speech systems right now, so go check out the store, go support
[59:42.380 --> 59:46.060]  their store, go support Info Wars, leave a donation right now.
[59:46.060 --> 59:51.140]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[59:51.140 --> 1:00:09.100]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:09.100 --> 1:00:26.900]  There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:32.100]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up, some say they sacrifice
[1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:38.940]  children and others believe they have magical powers, but the truth is much more simple.
[1:00:38.940 --> 1:00:43.580]  Many people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[1:00:43.580 --> 1:00:47.120]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:53.260]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow
[1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:55.420]  man.
[1:00:55.420 --> 1:00:58.280]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:04.260]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase pimps
[1:01:04.260 --> 1:01:05.980]  and hoes.
[1:01:05.980 --> 1:01:08.900]  If these words upset you, good.
[1:01:08.900 --> 1:01:14.620]  We are talking about the nature of evil, and if it makes light of it, even better.
[1:01:14.620 --> 1:01:17.300]  These animals are nothing to fear.
[1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:22.320]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks,
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.780]  they are nothing more than pimps and hoes, cannibals, feeding off other people like predatory
[1:01:28.780 --> 1:01:29.780]  animals.
[1:01:29.780 --> 1:01:36.980]  To completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love, Satanism is base-level animal tribalism,
[1:01:36.980 --> 1:01:43.140]  an animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top, the hoes they control, and the
[1:01:43.140 --> 1:01:46.420]  tricks they both exploit.
[1:01:46.420 --> 1:01:52.780]  This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia, a survival of the fittest
[1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:57.820]  dog-eat-dog world where the nice guys always finish last.
[1:01:57.820 --> 1:02:04.380]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-Christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense because
[1:02:04.380 --> 1:02:10.260]  we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love
[1:02:10.260 --> 1:02:13.580]  where everyone is equally welcome.
[1:02:13.580 --> 1:02:18.620]  There is much talk about a battle being waged between good and evil, but this sort of simple
[1:02:18.620 --> 1:02:22.900]  black and white duality only exists in our mind.
[1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:29.460]  In reality, what's going on is a balancing act between our spirit and our body.
[1:02:29.460 --> 1:02:34.820]  While our spirit may be drawn to love and light, our body is an animal with innate
[1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:38.700]  animal instincts that cannot easily be suppressed.
[1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:45.620]  And like every other species of animal, the primary instincts are survival and reproduction.
[1:02:45.620 --> 1:02:51.380]  So as far as mammals go, the female is the ultimate prize in the game of life.
[1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:57.780]  A society built upon a Christian ethos of brotherly love is one that honors individual
[1:02:57.780 --> 1:03:03.700]  freedom and the way to satisfy our animal desires for survival with brotherly love is
[1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:09.380]  through marriage and raising a family with some degree of selflessness.
[1:03:09.380 --> 1:03:14.580]  And without the Christian ethos of brotherly love, the Satanist simply sees women as the
[1:03:14.580 --> 1:03:20.660]  most valued commodity to be bought and sold for one's own selfish desire.
[1:03:20.660 --> 1:03:22.580]  Pimps and hoes.
[1:03:22.580 --> 1:03:27.620]  Whether it be in the poorest communities or at the top of the pyramid, Satanism is all
[1:03:27.620 --> 1:03:33.220]  about control and the ones at the top have invested everything into their technocratic
[1:03:33.220 --> 1:03:39.020]  pop culture media machine, which is their main method of pimping, and they see the brainwashed
[1:03:39.020 --> 1:03:44.820]  masses as their hoes because according to the laws of the jungle, they own them, which
[1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:49.980]  is why they resent the Christian ethos because it is the only thing on earth that stands
[1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.740]  against them.
[1:03:51.740 --> 1:03:57.020]  But the real problem with Satanism is that it keeps an individual from knowing God and
[1:03:57.020 --> 1:03:59.180]  discovering their true path.
[1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:05.580]  Our free will allows us the choice to either transcend spiritually, which requires a personal
[1:04:05.580 --> 1:04:12.860]  relationship with God, or descend into the animal kingdom and forever remain a beast,
[1:04:12.860 --> 1:04:18.340]  which is what the pimps and hoes are ultimately selling, but we don't have to buy it.
[1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:23.100]  Like influence has always been with us, and it is nothing to fear.
[1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:26.340]  These Satanist pimps are not gods.
[1:04:26.340 --> 1:04:30.980]  They are merely animals playing mind tricks and spinning lies.
[1:04:30.980 --> 1:04:35.180]  Redemption is for everyone, and humanity has a choice.
[1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:41.100]  We can either submit to the beast system and live like animals, or we can follow the Christian
[1:04:41.100 --> 1:04:49.980]  impulse for brotherly love and stand up against evil so that our children will know freedom.
[1:04:49.980 --> 1:04:59.540]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.

[1:06:06.180 --> 1:06:11.980]  Clashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[1:06:11.980 --> 1:06:22.180]  front lines of the info war.
[1:06:22.180 --> 1:06:29.780]  All right, we've got a surprise special guest in studio about the world economy and what's
[1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:35.860]  happening on to protect yourself and more bottom of the hour, but let's continue getting
[1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:38.420]  into this news here.
[1:06:38.420 --> 1:06:47.900]  So ABC poll Biden badly underwater on all of the top issues, inflation, gas prices, crime,
[1:06:47.900 --> 1:06:52.820]  gun violence, abortion, COVID-19.
[1:06:52.820 --> 1:06:58.340]  But the biggest issue is the inflation and the idea that Biden isn't the figurehead,
[1:06:58.340 --> 1:07:02.100]  the fact that the buck doesn't stop with him, the idea with countless headlines every day
[1:07:02.100 --> 1:07:10.580]  that Biden doesn't know how to fix the inflation, Biden doesn't know how to cut the gas prices.
[1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:16.740]  When what does he want more trillion dollar, $2 trillion, $3 trillion extra spending packages.
[1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:18.740]  He wants to forgive student loans.
[1:07:18.740 --> 1:07:23.620]  He wants to raise taxes on corporations, they've already written loopholes not to pay taxes.
[1:07:23.620 --> 1:07:27.660]  So the small corporations that actually do pay taxes will then pass the prices on.
[1:07:27.660 --> 1:07:30.860]  He says that will lower inflation.
[1:07:30.860 --> 1:07:31.860]  No.
[1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:36.780]  In an eighth grade economics class, they'll teach you that will increase taxes.
[1:07:36.780 --> 1:07:40.940]  But when they ask his Treasury Secretary about it, when they ask the Commerce Secretary
[1:07:40.940 --> 1:07:45.980]  about it, they say, oh, we've not contributed any to that.
[1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:46.980]  Those are quotes.
[1:07:46.980 --> 1:07:50.420]  You're like, that's not true.
[1:07:50.420 --> 1:07:52.700]  They're gaslighting.
[1:07:52.700 --> 1:08:00.140]  And so James Carville comes out, Democrat strategist economy will be number one issue
[1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:05.660]  in midterms, not abortion or guns, which is totally true.
[1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:10.820]  So why then are they spending all their time on the guns?
[1:08:10.820 --> 1:08:15.900]  Because that's the globalist agenda and what the big money, when big tech gives money
[1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:24.500]  or others, it's known you don't get the money, not just for their industry, but unless you
[1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:32.380]  promote pedophilia, open borders, devaluing currency, carbon taxes, net zero, all of the
[1:08:32.380 --> 1:08:36.340]  agenda of the World Economic Forum.
[1:08:36.340 --> 1:08:44.540]  And that's why we see Mitch McConnell and the rest of them vehemently supporting Biden
[1:08:44.540 --> 1:08:49.060]  and his six anti-gun bills.
[1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:55.940]  With Biden's approval rating hitting record low, GOP works to hand Dems a win on gun control,
[1:08:55.940 --> 1:08:59.060]  InformationLiberation.com, ArticleM4Wars.com.
[1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:04.980]  Joe Biden's approval rating is lower than every president of the modern era at this
[1:09:04.980 --> 1:09:12.440]  stage of the term, but Republican senators are working to hand him a big win and sell
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:19.100]  off their base by teaming up with Democrats to pass gun control legislation.
[1:09:19.100 --> 1:09:25.580]  And the article goes through all the different Republicans that are going along with this.
[1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:31.780]  Pat Toomey on Face the Nation and the rest of them, Mitch McConnell supporting the gun
[1:09:31.780 --> 1:09:33.780]  control measures.
[1:09:33.780 --> 1:09:39.820]  These people are a plague on us and our families.
[1:09:39.820 --> 1:09:42.140]  But what else are they doing?
[1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:47.140]  I mentioned this earlier, but let's actually name names here.
[1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:50.020]  Scoop Axios reports.
[1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:54.020]  January 6th committees secret advisor.
[1:09:54.020 --> 1:09:55.020]  Ooh.
[1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:58.060]  And they've got all the networks promoting.
[1:09:58.060 --> 1:10:02.460]  Oh, it's the biggest show on earth, bigger than PT, Barnum, step right up, ladies and
[1:10:02.460 --> 1:10:03.460]  gentlemen.
[1:10:03.460 --> 1:10:09.780]  We're going to show you incredible bombshell January 6th information proving Trump was
[1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:14.940]  commanding the attack on the Capitol.
[1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:21.700]  And then now the press, even mainstream media is reporting, well, we've been given a preview.
[1:10:21.700 --> 1:10:22.700]  There's no proof.
[1:10:22.700 --> 1:10:25.820]  Oh, you want proof?
[1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:31.300]  The House January 6th committee has turned to a renowned former network news executive
[1:10:31.300 --> 1:10:36.660]  to hone a mountain of explosive material into a captivating multimedia presentation for
[1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:45.180]  prime time hearing, James Goldston, former president of ABC News, he also produces TV
[1:10:45.180 --> 1:10:50.660]  shows and a master documentary storyteller who ran Good Morning America and Nightline
[1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:55.300]  all with employer ratings has joined the committee as an unannounced advisor.
[1:10:55.300 --> 1:10:58.020]  Oh my gosh.
[1:10:58.020 --> 1:11:00.660]  You mean it's a Hollywood production?
[1:11:00.660 --> 1:11:02.140]  Why it matters?
[1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:08.820]  I'm told Goldston is busily producing Thursday's 8 p.m. ET hearing as if it were a blockbuster
[1:11:08.820 --> 1:11:13.380]  investigative special.
[1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:17.200]  So their own advisors say, listen, they don't care about January 6th.
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:19.180]  They know it's crazy people with guns.
[1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:20.980]  The public doesn't want their guns taken.
[1:11:20.980 --> 1:11:27.020]  They care about inflation, exploding energy prices that are part of that, the open borders,
[1:11:27.020 --> 1:11:34.180]  the crime waves, and her answer is, but we're going to tell you that January 6th was just
[1:11:34.180 --> 1:11:42.580]  the ultimate example of evil ever seen on planet Earth.
[1:11:42.580 --> 1:11:45.340]  And it goes on from there.
[1:11:45.340 --> 1:11:51.220]  Gun violence results in at least 10 mass shootings over the weekend, Wall Street Journal reports,
[1:11:51.220 --> 1:11:58.660]  but it's not getting a lot of coverage because almost every one of them was black gangs shooting
[1:11:58.660 --> 1:12:01.220]  black gangs.
[1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:05.860]  And it's still terrible and I'm against it and I wish it wouldn't have happened, but
[1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:13.060]  it's not that white supremacists that they were looking for, making a black on black,
[1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:15.940]  but this is Islamic on Christian.
[1:12:15.940 --> 1:12:20.620]  Nigeria is being invaded by Boko Haram.
[1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:26.860]  Nigeria has tens of thousands of its mainly Christian citizens killed every year by Muslims
[1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:30.540]  coming out of the North, trying to take it over.
[1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:38.980]  And so yesterday, there was at least 50 killed, including women and children in a satanic massacre,
[1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:47.220]  the sun calls it, and I have Reuters and other articles saying, we don't know who did it.
[1:12:47.220 --> 1:12:53.780]  There have been hundreds of mall and market and church shootings where the Islamists know
[1:12:53.780 --> 1:13:02.180]  it's all Christians, I forget the exact demographics, but it's like 60% Christian, 30% animist,
[1:13:02.180 --> 1:13:08.940]  meaning nature worshipers, sun worshipers, and 10% Muslim.
[1:13:08.940 --> 1:13:13.780]  It was like 5% a decade ago, the Muslims are taking over.
[1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:19.020]  And of course the prime suspects in Kenya or Nigeria or wherever you are in Africa is
[1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:20.020]  the Muslims.
[1:13:20.020 --> 1:13:26.940]  Hell in Sudan, it's a 15 year war, the Muslims attacking the South, trying to kill all the
[1:13:26.940 --> 1:13:27.940]  Christians.
[1:13:27.940 --> 1:13:39.620]  They even got bombers and tanks and missiles given to them by places like Saudi Arabia.
[1:13:39.620 --> 1:13:44.260]  So at least 50 people have been slaughtered in a satanic massacre.
[1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:49.060]  I twisted government dubbed bandits at a Nigerian church, yeah bandits.
[1:13:49.060 --> 1:13:52.340]  Women and children were among the victims of the government open fire on works for the
[1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:59.140]  side and outside St. Francis Catholic Church, the town of Owo.
[1:13:59.140 --> 1:14:04.900]  And nowhere here do they ever say, hmm, wonder if it's the group that's done it over and
[1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:05.900]  over again.
[1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:09.980]  The media is still controlled, even if Boko Haram or other groups take credit, you're
[1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:14.900]  not going to see it in the news.
[1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:27.620]  Meanwhile, I didn't get to this clip yesterday, we're going to play it when we come back.
[1:14:27.620 --> 1:14:29.500]  When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
[1:14:29.500 --> 1:14:33.740]  And when I made a mistake, I admit it.
[1:14:33.740 --> 1:14:43.420]  And I've got egg all over my face, Alex Jones is not always right.
[1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:51.860]  And I'm ashamed of myself and I don't say that to, to, to like, oh, look, he's ashamed
[1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:52.860]  of himself.
[1:14:52.860 --> 1:14:57.300]  I mean, I mean, that's how I feel.
[1:14:57.300 --> 1:15:01.460]  And I need to admit that.
[1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:08.860]  I am tired.
[1:15:08.860 --> 1:15:13.500]  And I didn't want to get in the car and drive three hours to Uvaldi.
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.820]  And I just want to believe in Texas and I want to believe in police.
[1:15:15.820 --> 1:15:19.460]  I want to believe in the system, because I know that that old system is not perfect,
[1:15:19.460 --> 1:15:20.460]  but it's under attack.
[1:15:20.460 --> 1:15:26.460]  So I got up here on air and I regurgitated the official story.
[1:15:26.460 --> 1:15:35.100]  And even after the evidence came out that it was a lie, I just lazily went along with
[1:15:35.100 --> 1:15:36.340]  it.
[1:15:36.340 --> 1:15:40.020]  And now the jury's in.
[1:15:40.020 --> 1:15:43.940]  And well, I'll tell you the rest of the other side, I'll just, I'll be completely honest,
[1:15:43.940 --> 1:15:44.940]  because it's not just about me.
[1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:48.500]  It's about understanding the thought process that we're all having.
[1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:52.860]  But the Uvaldi smells bad guys.
[1:15:52.860 --> 1:15:57.860]  And I'll just say it when we come back, stay with us.
[1:15:57.860 --> 1:16:03.500]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:04.940]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:16:04.940 --> 1:16:09.220]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:16:09.220 --> 1:16:10.900]  I tried to stop it.
[1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:15.940]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:16:15.940 --> 1:16:21.100]  the globalist aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:27.300]  It's now out in the open, Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg
[1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.260]  group founded Davos group.
[1:16:29.260 --> 1:16:32.260]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:16:32.260 --> 1:16:35.460]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:36.460]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:16:36.460 --> 1:16:38.340]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:42.100]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:16:42.100 --> 1:16:45.540]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:16:45.540 --> 1:16:49.860]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[1:16:49.860 --> 1:16:52.260]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:16:52.260 --> 1:16:56.780]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:16:56.780 --> 1:16:57.780]  your efforts.
[1:16:57.780 --> 1:17:03.020]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years and we have some of those original designs
[1:17:03.020 --> 1:17:05.380]  still for sale at infowarstore.com.

[1:17:11.180 --> 1:17:12.380]  out of them.

[1:17:42.780 --> 1:17:47.340]  resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available

[1:18:03.860 --> 1:18:09.100]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been
[1:18:09.100 --> 1:18:13.260]  a patriot apparel so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we
[1:18:13.260 --> 1:18:18.300]  can push people to websites like infowars.com so they can understand the globalist plan
[1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:19.300]  and how to stop it.
[1:18:19.300 --> 1:18:22.500]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[1:18:22.500 --> 1:18:26.220]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:27.500]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:31.660]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:32.660]  wardrobe.
[1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:36.980]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left in a couple of weeks.
[1:18:36.980 --> 1:18:38.860]  They'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:43.660]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:43.660 --> 1:18:45.500]  So thank you all for your support.

[1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:52.860]  ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[1:18:52.860 --> 1:18:55.260]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:18:55.260 --> 1:18:56.260]  Infowarsstore.com.
[1:18:56.260 --> 1:19:00.620]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[1:19:00.620 --> 1:19:04.740]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is
[1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:06.300]  going to level the playing field.
[1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:08.900]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:11.500]  to freely communicate that information.
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:17.420]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:22.460]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[1:19:22.460 --> 1:19:27.340]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[1:19:27.340 --> 1:19:34.580]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:39.540]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:42.020]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:19:42.020 --> 1:19:46.260]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[1:19:46.260 --> 1:19:47.260]  back their privacy.
[1:19:47.260 --> 1:19:52.260]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening
[1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:59.780]  will check us out at boltowireless.com, that's V-O-L-T-A, wireless.com.
[1:19:59.780 --> 1:20:05.940]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:28.820]  I see the lens of the world through my own eyes, so do you.
[1:20:28.820 --> 1:20:36.740]  And so, no amount of intimidation, no amount of threats, no amount of attacks is going to
[1:20:36.740 --> 1:20:39.900]  make me change what I say and I do.
[1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:46.120]  And so, two weeks ago, when the tragic event unfolded in Yvaldi, Texas, with 19 children
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:54.300]  and two teachers killed, there were publications everywhere saying, Will Alex Jones say this
[1:20:54.300 --> 1:20:58.620]  is a false flag, Will Alex Jones say this was staged?
[1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:04.700]  Because Jones always says it's staged, no, I don't always say it's staged.
[1:21:04.700 --> 1:21:08.460]  When there's an hour stand down at Columbine and they knew it was going to happen and they
[1:21:08.460 --> 1:21:12.540]  stood down, I said it was suspicious, and the children reported, the teenagers reported
[1:21:12.540 --> 1:21:16.540]  multiple gunmen in the building and men that were adults doing it.
[1:21:16.540 --> 1:21:20.260]  We've covered that, Gregory said a great report on it last week.
[1:21:20.260 --> 1:21:25.780]  And then you look at the stand down in Broward County a few years ago, the tragic event,
[1:21:25.780 --> 1:21:28.660]  what happened there and they knew the guy was a shooter, they knew he was planning it,
[1:21:28.660 --> 1:21:34.100]  they called him a school shooter, they stood down for at least 12, 14 minutes outside when
[1:21:34.100 --> 1:21:37.260]  they knew he was running around shooting people.
[1:21:37.260 --> 1:21:41.460]  And the list goes on and on, we have the Buffalo white supremacist shooter, turns out was in
[1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:45.620]  constant communication with a former federal agent.
[1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:51.100]  That obviously leads to provocaturing, leans towards that.
[1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:55.180]  So just because I've been sued by the Democratic Party for questioning mass shootings, is it
[1:21:55.180 --> 1:22:01.580]  the reason I came out two weeks ago on Tuesday after it happened and said, well, the police
[1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:06.180]  say that they chased him in there and engaged him and a hero, a Border Patrol agent killed
[1:22:06.180 --> 1:22:08.340]  him within 12 minutes.
[1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:14.580]  And then, well, he was barricaded inside there and we're not sure and it was 45 minutes
[1:22:14.580 --> 1:22:16.820]  and then it was 60 minutes and then it was 70 minutes.
[1:22:16.820 --> 1:22:23.020]  Now it's 75 minutes that they stood outside the state police, local police, all of them
[1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:26.700]  and held the families back and they lied about it for a week.
[1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:30.900]  And finally the head of the DPS went down there and said, I was misled and the governor
[1:22:30.900 --> 1:22:31.900]  said he was misled.
[1:22:31.900 --> 1:22:35.820]  And then I said, okay, it looks like we were lied to.
[1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:40.500]  But I should have gotten in a car and I should have gone down there three hours away and
[1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:43.660]  I should have interviewed people like I used to do.
[1:22:43.660 --> 1:22:46.460]  I didn't not do it because I've been sued for asking questions.
[1:22:46.460 --> 1:22:50.420]  I still said, Jesse Smollett and Bubba Wallace were staged and we still, we think something
[1:22:50.420 --> 1:22:51.780]  stayed to say it.
[1:22:51.780 --> 1:22:57.060]  But I still kind of just stayed out of it because it's such a toxic situation.
[1:22:57.060 --> 1:23:00.780]  And if it happens again like this, we won't be like that.
[1:23:00.780 --> 1:23:07.740]  So I subconsciously backed off of this because it's so painful.
[1:23:07.740 --> 1:23:13.300]  I mean, who wants to be around something like that and the grieving parents and others.
[1:23:13.300 --> 1:23:16.340]  And so we dropped the ball.
[1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:20.060]  We gave the police the benefit of the doubt because it's Texas and the police have been
[1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:22.700]  under attack and I want to believe in the police.
[1:23:22.700 --> 1:23:28.500]  But the head police chief of the school district there is in hiding.
[1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:31.340]  He was already elected to the city council.
[1:23:31.340 --> 1:23:33.380]  He won't talk to the press.
[1:23:33.380 --> 1:23:35.580]  He won't talk to the state police for Texas Rangers.
[1:23:35.580 --> 1:23:41.820]  He won't talk to the feds and who knows what happened because it turns out there weren't
[1:23:41.820 --> 1:23:43.500]  police in there for an hour.
[1:23:43.500 --> 1:23:46.460]  It turns out they weren't outside the barricaded door.
[1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:49.900]  They now say none of that was true.
[1:23:49.900 --> 1:23:56.820]  On what planet do we live for 70 plus minutes, hundreds of police stand around sitting on
[1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:57.820]  their hands.
[1:23:57.820 --> 1:24:05.180]  That's a nice way of saying it with their thumbs in their errands, doing nothing because
[1:24:05.180 --> 1:24:13.180]  the head cop of the school district said so, who it turns out wasn't in radio communication
[1:24:13.180 --> 1:24:16.260]  and who it turns out wasn't even on the scene.
[1:24:16.260 --> 1:24:18.300]  That's dereliction of duty.
[1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:31.380]  That is serious negligence and I want him indicted for negligence and I want him indicted
[1:24:31.380 --> 1:24:37.060]  for fraud and I want everybody else that lied in trouble because if we don't keep the police
[1:24:37.060 --> 1:24:42.620]  accountable, we're in a police state.
[1:24:42.620 --> 1:24:45.180]  That doesn't mean when the left goes after them for no reason we back them.
[1:24:45.180 --> 1:24:51.780]  But this is shameful and this is disgusting and quite frankly who the hell knows what
[1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:52.780]  happened.
[1:24:52.780 --> 1:24:56.940]  I'm really suspicious now of this police chief and I'm really suspicious of the whole thing
[1:24:56.940 --> 1:25:00.700]  in the timing and the midterms and all of it and you got the white supremacists with
[1:25:00.700 --> 1:25:05.820]  the feds and all of it and that's being covered up.
[1:25:05.820 --> 1:25:06.820]  Is the average cop bad?
[1:25:06.820 --> 1:25:11.180]  No, they followed orders and stood there but these moms had better instincts and the off
[1:25:11.180 --> 1:25:12.860]  duty cops went and got their own kids.
[1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:16.700]  So here's this powerful woman, who I really want to get on the show, I don't want to send
[1:25:16.700 --> 1:25:20.820]  Kristi Lee down there to interview her or others, Uvaldi mom who saved kids from school
[1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:26.540]  shooting says police threatened her.
[1:25:26.540 --> 1:25:35.740]  This is Angela Gomez, this woman is who the police chief should be.
[1:25:35.740 --> 1:25:45.300]  I am so ashamed of Texas, I'm ashamed that I bought their BS and I pissed.
[1:25:45.300 --> 1:25:51.340]  Now I don't know what went on down there but for all we know it could be MKUltra.
[1:25:51.340 --> 1:25:56.220]  For all we know, my God, yet again man, just like the Whitmer case I thought was staged,
[1:25:56.220 --> 1:26:00.020]  I learned that it was all fake.
[1:26:00.020 --> 1:26:02.460]  We need to find out what the hell is going on.
[1:26:02.460 --> 1:26:05.460]  This guy told six friends he was going to shoot the school up, the police were told
[1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:08.260]  and were not given a warrant to go after him.
[1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:10.060]  Why are the police following orders?
[1:26:10.060 --> 1:26:15.660]  It's following orders at a time like this and the cops tasing fathers and mothers, it's
[1:26:15.660 --> 1:26:22.380]  disgusting and the police aided and abetted that murderer by protecting him while he killed
[1:26:22.380 --> 1:26:25.380]  those people.
[1:26:25.380 --> 1:26:30.540]  The rest of you because you're being very uncooperative, I said well you're going to
[1:26:30.540 --> 1:26:34.140]  have to arrest him because I'm going in there and I'm telling you right now I don't see
[1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:38.900]  none of y'all in there, y'all are standing with snipers and y'all are far away, if y'all
[1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:40.700]  don't go in there I'm going in there.
[1:26:40.700 --> 1:26:43.060]  He immediately put me in cuffs.
[1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:47.820]  She says after Uvaldi police officers told marshals to uncuff Gomez, she ran towards
[1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:48.820]  the school.
[1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:52.620]  As soon as they uncuffed me I jumped that first gate fence and once I jumped it I went
[1:26:52.620 --> 1:26:57.820]  to my son's class and I knocked on the door and I remember the teacher saying, I'm like
[1:26:57.820 --> 1:27:01.140]  hey they're already, they're already, uh, boge cutting the fence to get me.
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:04.140]  She's like you think we have time to get out, I say y'all have time, I'm going to run for
[1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:05.340]  my other son.
[1:27:05.340 --> 1:27:10.180]  Once she was assured her son was okay, Gomez ran to get her other child, encountering
[1:27:10.180 --> 1:27:12.860]  more officers who tried to stop her.
[1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:16.660]  So I start yelling and I'm being uncooperative and I'm like well y'all aren't doing **** what
[1:27:16.660 --> 1:27:19.940]  are y'all doing, y'all ain't doing **** y'all need to be in here, give me a vest, somebody
[1:27:19.940 --> 1:27:21.540]  give me a vest, something.
[1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:25.900]  I started paying attention to how far the shots were being so that I knew the shooter
[1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:28.700]  was all the way still by my first son's class.
[1:27:28.700 --> 1:27:32.980]  So when I went to my second son's door the teacher didn't want to open the door for me
[1:27:32.980 --> 1:27:38.460]  so that's when they started escorting me out and as I see that they're opening my son's
[1:27:38.460 --> 1:27:40.880]  door I go run for my son and I get him.
[1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:45.980]  With both of her kids out safe Gomez still can't shake the thought of those who didn't
[1:27:45.980 --> 1:27:46.980]  make it.
[1:27:46.980 --> 1:27:51.820]  So while you were inside the school did you see officers inside the school?
[1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:54.820]  There was not one officer inside the school when I ran to my second son's class.
[1:27:54.820 --> 1:27:56.260]  There was not one officer.
[1:27:56.260 --> 1:27:59.500]  And you were here in gunshots so you knew that it was an active shooter.
[1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:00.500]  You could hear the gunshots.
[1:28:00.500 --> 1:28:01.500]  It was still active.
[1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:02.820]  The gunshots were still active.
[1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:04.260]  They were not in there.
[1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:05.260]  There was no one in there.
[1:28:05.260 --> 1:28:10.180]  If anything when I pulled out my car was closer to the school than where the snipers
[1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:12.580]  and everybody that was laying on the ground were.
[1:28:12.580 --> 1:28:17.140]  When you heard that it took law enforcement 75 minutes before they went in and stopped
[1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:21.900]  the shooter, what was your thinking having been inside the school yourself?
[1:28:21.900 --> 1:28:22.900]  I don't know.
[1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:26.100]  I was just thinking that they could have saved many more lives.
[1:28:26.100 --> 1:28:31.140]  They could have gone into that classroom and maybe two or three would have been gone.
[1:28:31.140 --> 1:28:33.300]  So this woman followed her God given instinct.
[1:28:33.300 --> 1:28:39.020]  She's a good mother and the police followed the criminal orders of that police chief who
[1:28:39.020 --> 1:28:40.660]  needs to be in handcuffs right now.
[1:28:40.660 --> 1:28:43.820]  Hey, I want him arrested now.
[1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:46.620]  Arrest that son of a bitch right now.
[1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:47.620]  Right now.
[1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:49.180]  No more of this crap.
[1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:52.180]  I've bitched out Florida for standing out for 14 minutes.
[1:28:52.180 --> 1:28:57.740]  Texas stands down for over 70 shameful.

[1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:57.500]  Thanks for being part of the tip of the spear.
[1:29:57.500 --> 1:30:03.140]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:04.620]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:08.860]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[1:30:08.860 --> 1:30:10.540]  I tried to stop it.
[1:30:10.540 --> 1:30:15.620]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:20.740]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:30:20.740 --> 1:30:22.340]  It's now out in the open.
[1:30:22.340 --> 1:30:26.460]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:28.940]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos Group.
[1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:31.980]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:30:31.980 --> 1:30:35.140]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:36.140]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:30:36.140 --> 1:30:37.140]  God's watching.
[1:30:37.140 --> 1:30:38.140]  The children are counting on us.
[1:30:38.140 --> 1:30:41.780]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[1:30:41.780 --> 1:30:45.220]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:30:45.220 --> 1:30:49.620]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[1:30:49.620 --> 1:30:51.900]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:56.420]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:30:56.420 --> 1:30:57.420]  your efforts.

[1:31:09.300 --> 1:31:14.020]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence and they'll never be made again.
[1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:17.860]  The bank that owns the mint that has started putting these out the last few years just
[1:31:17.860 --> 1:31:23.620]  sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering that was 40% more than what we're selling
[1:31:23.620 --> 1:31:24.620]  these for.

[1:31:54.100 --> 1:31:57.580]  Visit infowarstore.com today.

[1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:07.780]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:10.980]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:18.100]  We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to
[1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:24.700]  collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing
[1:32:24.700 --> 1:32:31.140]  the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[1:32:31.140 --> 1:32:36.980]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030,
[1:32:36.980 --> 1:32:42.700]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it and none of it can succeed, none of it can
[1:32:42.700 --> 1:32:47.140]  actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:51.180]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence and that's
[1:32:51.180 --> 1:32:55.540]  why it's hard to share infowar's links and band of video links, that's why we've got
[1:32:55.540 --> 1:32:59.620]  to share them now more than ever.
[1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:13.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:13.420 --> 1:33:17.420]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:17.420 --> 1:33:22.700]  Do you want to take a lie?
[1:33:22.700 --> 1:33:27.020]  Do you want to cross that line?
[1:33:27.020 --> 1:33:31.700]  Because it's a long way back from hell.
[1:33:31.700 --> 1:33:54.340]  It wasn't until this Friday night that I hit a wall, I was supposed to be finishing my
[1:33:54.340 --> 1:34:20.260]  nightly newsletter, but I'm not sure.
[1:34:20.260 --> 1:34:22.580]  Do you like your new body?
[1:34:22.580 --> 1:34:29.580]  I love it.
[1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:46.180]  This is my biggest bucket list right here.
[1:34:46.180 --> 1:35:09.540]  Have she gone or is she here?
[1:35:09.540 --> 1:35:22.260]  Catherine Kennedy's employment status is queer.
[1:35:22.260 --> 1:35:24.540]  Live coverage of the world burning.
[1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:26.340]  This is the info war with Alex Jones.
[1:35:26.340 --> 1:35:28.420]  Thank you for joining us today.
[1:35:28.420 --> 1:35:34.140]  Your call special guest coming up right now.
[1:35:34.140 --> 1:35:35.140]  What's happening?
[1:35:35.140 --> 1:35:36.140]  What are you over in the UK?
[1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:37.140]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1:35:37.140 --> 1:35:38.140]  Sorry.
[1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:40.140]  It's not funny.
[1:35:40.140 --> 1:35:45.140]  You're extremely handsome.
[1:35:45.140 --> 1:36:07.140]  I want you to want me, I need you to need me, I love you to love me, and I'll get you
[1:36:07.140 --> 1:36:08.140]  to love me.
[1:36:08.140 --> 1:36:10.660]  Sweet love is just that fun here on there.
[1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:17.460]  And it's good to have a balance, but at the same time, the world's a very serious place.
[1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:20.920]  The way to reach new people is comedy, and that's what we're doing here today.
[1:36:20.920 --> 1:36:22.560]  Serious stuff's come up right now.
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  I did not, did not see you cryin', I did not, did...
[1:36:30.560 --> 1:36:33.560]  Yeah! I love this show!
[1:36:33.560 --> 1:36:35.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:49.560]  Here they come and the star cannot wait
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:51.560]  All hail Friday Night Tights!
[1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:55.560]  I apologize, this is probably late
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:36:58.560]  All hail Friday Night Tights!
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:02.560]  Radical rise!
[1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:05.560]  And bloody organize!
[1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:07.560]  It's Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:09.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:14.560 --> 1:37:17.560]  Time has come, they are finally here
[1:37:17.560 --> 1:37:19.560]  All hail Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:23.560]  We're not affiliated, just so we're clear
[1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:26.560]  All hail Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:27.560 --> 1:37:33.560]  Sweet Mother Mary, tell me how you got real
[1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:35.560]  It's Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:38.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:38.560 --> 1:37:40.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:42.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  Friday Night Tights!
[1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:53.560]  Oh!
[1:37:54.560 --> 1:37:56.560]  You know, I love stuff like that
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:37:59.560]  And I love going on comedy shows, I love having a lot of fun with people
[1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:02.560]  And that's actually what I want to do, that's who I am
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:07.560]  But we got serious issues to cover in this very serious world
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.560]  So I asked one of the smartest lawyers I know
[1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:14.560]  To fly out here from Los Angeles, this big six-story compound
[1:38:14.560 --> 1:38:19.560]  And to take your calls today for the next hour
[1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:21.560]  And 22 minutes we have left of them
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:26.560]  But ahead of the next guest host that takes over, Gerald Salente, in the fourth hour
[1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:29.560]  And we're going to open the phones up specifically
[1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:33.560]  For all of you that have economic and tax questions
[1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:36.560]  And the reason I hyped this so much
[1:38:36.560 --> 1:38:38.560]  Is it's a total 360 win
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:43.560]  And anything that's a win for everybody is where I live
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  Alex Jones lives in the 360 win
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:49.560]  If it helps me and it helps you and it helps everybody
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  That's where I'm at, that's the Genesis factor
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  That's what God gave us
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:56.560]  We're supposed to do stuff that helps ourselves and helps others
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:00.560]  And if we got to get hurt ourselves to help others, well we do it
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:04.560]  But that's if we have to, we want the 360 win
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:07.560]  We don't want to be martyrs here, we need to, we'll do it
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:11.560]  But we want the non-zero sum game
[1:39:11.560 --> 1:39:13.560]  And so I asked him to fly here a few weeks ago
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:16.560]  He was too busy because he's got so many companies and so many big things
[1:39:16.560 --> 1:39:18.560]  And a big trust company they run, but he got here
[1:39:18.560 --> 1:39:23.560]  And he's here actually to advise us on taxes and things
[1:39:23.560 --> 1:39:25.560]  That's why he brought some of his great crew today
[1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:28.560]  They're meeting just a few offices over from us
[1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:31.560]  The Tyler Bennett, great tax lawyer, great guy
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:34.560]  American Tax Solutions, JonesTaxRelief.com
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.560]  They take you right to where it's the same site
[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.560]  But we get sponsorship from the number of people that go there
[1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:42.560]  Just do a consultation, folks
[1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:45.560]  You're crazy if you don't
[1:39:45.560 --> 1:39:49.560]  JonesTaxRelief.com will put the toll free number on screen as well
[1:39:49.560 --> 1:39:55.560]  But we're going to take calls starting next hour for a full hour
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:57.560]  Your tax questions and believe me
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:01.560]  Whether you are a busboy or whether you are a millionaire
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:04.560]  You're doing a car dealership, you're a farmer, whether you're an auto mechanic
[1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:07.560]  Or whether you're a teacher, it doesn't matter
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:09.560]  The system has all these loopholes for themselves
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:12.560]  They're totally legal that they don't want you to know about
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:14.560]  So I'll give the number out as we go to break
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:16.560]  Coming up here in a few minutes, but Tyler Bennett
[1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  You've also got a bunch of notes here
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:21.560]  You knocked it out of the park today on American Journal with Harrison Smith
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:22.560]  Well, thanks
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  Great to be back, Alex
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:27.560]  And in studio here in the wonderful state of Texas
[1:40:27.560 --> 1:40:31.560]  And you know what it's all about is inflation, okay
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:36.560]  Because there's taxes, but then you're getting taxed again on inflation
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:40.560]  And if you are not the fat cats at the top
[1:40:40.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  And you don't have the proper representation
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:46.560]  Dollars per donuts, you're paying more than you absolutely need to in taxes
[1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:49.560]  Which, according to the IRS Bill of Rights
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:52.560]  It's your right to pay the least amount as legally possible
[1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.560]  Using all legal avenues available, right
[1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:58.560]  And in this system that we exist in right now
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:01.560]  It's akin to taxation without representation
[1:41:01.560 --> 1:41:04.560]  Because you don't know what the tax laws are
[1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:06.560]  And even the IRS has admitted
[1:41:06.560 --> 1:41:08.560]  There are people that collect against you in the state
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:10.560]  They don't know what the tax laws are either
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:11.560]  They just go off of the map
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.560]  I don't want to be clear right here
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:15.560]  There's three or four groups
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:18.560]  But there's globalists that pay no taxes on the system
[1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:20.560]  There's people that know the loopholes
[1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:22.560]  For the nouveau rich and the general public
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:24.560]  That can mitigate it 90%
[1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:27.560]  Then there's people that just sort of chumps and go along and get ripped off
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:30.560]  And then there's people that believe a bunch of
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  Hey, I don't have to pay this, it's all a fraud
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  And you might be okay, you might get your legs broken
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:37.560]  And I'm not bashing you if you do that
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:41.560]  For me, this is the safest, clearest way to mitigate it
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:43.560]  And not get put in prison
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:44.560]  Absolutely Alex
[1:41:44.560 --> 1:41:46.560]  So when we talk about those three groups
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:49.560]  The group on top, it's a club, you and me
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:52.560]  And all your listeners, we're never going to be part of their club
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:56.560]  But the thing is, that specific group of corporations
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:41:59.560]  And people, Facebook, Apple
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:02.560]  They are, the oil companies now
[1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:03.560]  Amazon
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:06.560]  They're posting record profits this year
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:09.560]  And the reason is because inflation does not affect them
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.560]  In the same way it does you and me
[1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:13.560]  For you and me, we go to the gas pump
[1:42:13.560 --> 1:42:16.560]  And we pay more for the same gallon of gas
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:18.560]  Because our dollar is worth less
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:21.560]  The corporations and the people on top of the pyramid
[1:42:21.560 --> 1:42:23.560]  They just charge more and make more money
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:25.560]  And I'm going to explain that when we come back
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:27.560]  Because like, Biden's asked
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:30.560]  Oh, let's increase corporation taxes
[1:42:30.560 --> 1:42:31.560]  They'll just pass it on
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:34.560]  Absolutely, they passed that on directly to the consumer
[1:42:34.560 --> 1:42:37.560]  Just as they are doing with inflation right now
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:38.560]  All right, Tyler Bennett, stay there
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:40.560]  And I got articles from the Associated Press
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:42.560]  And others to back you up
[1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:44.560]  This is what they don't want you to know
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:47.560]  And the thrill of my life is teaching people the hat trick
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:49.560]  Teaching them the majestic trick
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:51.560]  Because I want to empower you
[1:42:51.560 --> 1:43:20.560]  I believe in you, and I'll be right back to you about this
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:24.560]  Then you'll normally find at infowarstore.com

[1:43:55.560 --> 1:43:56.560]  While getting great products
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:43:59.560]  So I did it
[1:43:59.560 --> 1:44:01.560]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:02.560]  I've been training
[1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:04.560]  Probably not as much as they should be
[1:44:04.560 --> 1:44:06.560]  But thank goodness for prayer
[1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.560]  And thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:10.560]  Before I set out on a run
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:12.560]  I throw down some Turbo Force
[1:44:12.560 --> 1:44:14.560]  To give me that energy I need
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:15.560]  To get going, you know
[1:44:15.560 --> 1:44:17.560]  Besides the energy, Turbo Force
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:19.560]  It is giving me the vitamins I need
[1:44:19.560 --> 1:44:21.560]  Like vitamin C to keep me healthy
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:23.560]  And the essential B vitamins
[1:44:23.560 --> 1:44:25.560]  Plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[1:44:25.560 --> 1:44:26.560]  Giving me the best chance

[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:29.560]  And then every day now
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:32.560]  I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soralis
[1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:33.560]  I have bad joints
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:34.560]  Thanks mom
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:35.560]  So this is great
[1:44:35.560 --> 1:44:37.560]  For giving my joints the extra support

[1:46:05.560 --> 1:46:06.560]  It planted in it
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:07.560]  And on the back
[1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:08.560]  It's got a hologram
[1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:10.560]  There are only 25,000 of these
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.560]  In existence
[1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:13.560]  And they'll never be made again

[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:35.560]  Not BS
[1:48:35.560 --> 1:48:37.560]  Not vapor in the air
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:40.560]  Not some of the patriotness
[1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:41.560]  Info out there

[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:54.560]  And let's put it on screen
[1:48:54.560 --> 1:48:55.560]  Because I've got it here
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:56.560]  In my folder
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:48:58.560]  But let's put it on screen
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:48:59.560]  The website is
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  Jonestaxrelief.com
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:02.560]  And then there's also
[1:49:02.560 --> 1:49:03.560]  A toll free number
[1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:05.560]  Which I do not have memorized
[1:49:05.560 --> 1:49:06.560]  Here it is
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:10.560]  833-904285
[1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:11.560]  There it is
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:14.560]  833-904285
[1:49:14.560 --> 1:49:15.560]  Jonestaxrelief.com
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  833-942-85
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:19.560]  Tyler Bennett
[1:49:19.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  Those calls are getting
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:21.560]  Wrecked up
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  And loaded up right now
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:23.560]  To ask you questions
[1:49:23.560 --> 1:49:24.560]  But you've got a lot of notes there
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:25.560]  Brother, take it away
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:26.560]  All right, Alex
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:27.560]  So as we were saying
[1:49:27.560 --> 1:49:29.560]  Right before the commercial break
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:33.560]  Those top 25 people, if you will
[1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:37.560]  Made $400 billion last year
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:39.560]  And collectively they paid
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:42.560]  $13.4 billion in taxes
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:43.560]  Now, if you do the math
[1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:45.560]  That's less than 5%
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:48.560]  And the reason why that's infuriating
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:51.560]  Is you, me, and your audience
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:53.560]  In the middle class here
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:54.560]  We collectively as the middle class
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:57.560]  Paid $146 billion
[1:49:57.560 --> 1:49:59.560]  So we're paying 10 times
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:00.560]  The amount of taxes
[1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:01.560]  That these people are
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:03.560]  And again, it's because
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  They use specific methods
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:07.560]  That we know how to do
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:10.560]  To help mitigate their taxes
[1:50:10.560 --> 1:50:12.560]  For example, you know
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:13.560]  There's trusts
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:15.560]  We've talked about that before
[1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:16.560]  There's corporations
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:19.560]  And when you said a vapor-wisp
[1:50:19.560 --> 1:50:20.560]  See, the thing is
[1:50:20.560 --> 1:50:22.560]  The difference between a vapor-wisp
[1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:24.560]  And a legal corporation
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:25.560]  Or a legal trust
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:27.560]  Is a piece of paper that is
[1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:29.560]  You know, signed by an attorney
[1:50:29.560 --> 1:50:30.560]  Contract power
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:31.560]  Exactly
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:33.560]  And that's what these people
[1:50:33.560 --> 1:50:35.560]  Make utilizations of
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.560]  That the middle class doesn't
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:38.560]  And it's because of a lack
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:39.560]  Of education generally
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:41.560]  You know, I never learned
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:43.560]  In high school how to do taxes
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  Entity, any sort of
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:45.560]  Financial literacy at all
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:46.560]  That's by design
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  Exactly, it is by design
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:49.560]  Because they want to keep
[1:50:49.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  Their club just exactly that
[1:50:52.560 --> 1:50:54.560]  You're not part of the cabal
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:56.560]  So you can pay more in taxes
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:57.560]  George Carlin says
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:50:58.560]  It's a big club and you ain't it
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.560]  That's exactly right
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:01.560]  Brilliant, man
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  So
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:04.560]  But this lets us crash the club
[1:51:04.560 --> 1:51:05.560]  Exactly
[1:51:05.560 --> 1:51:06.560]  So what they do
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:08.560]  What the globalists do is
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:09.560]  They're right here
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:10.560]  Their assets are right here
[1:51:10.560 --> 1:51:12.560]  And they put the most amount
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:16.560]  Of entities, trusts, corporations
[1:51:16.560 --> 1:51:18.560]  Literally pieces of paper
[1:51:18.560 --> 1:51:19.560]  In between them
[1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:20.560]  And they act like it's all
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:21.560]  Super secret, but really
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:23.560]  It's all right there for anybody
[1:51:23.560 --> 1:51:25.560]  It is actually right there
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:27.560]  For anybody in the tax code
[1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:29.560]  But I've told people this
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:31.560]  Before, if you're ever
[1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  Can't sleep at night and you're up
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:36.560]  Take a read of just a few pages
[1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:37.560]  Of the tax code
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:38.560]  You'll be out in minutes
[1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  Because it's written to be
[1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:43.560]  Horribly boring and hard to understand
[1:51:43.560 --> 1:51:46.560]  And that is, again, by design
[1:51:46.560 --> 1:51:47.560]  But we
[1:51:47.560 --> 1:51:49.560]  Every line sources some other document
[1:51:49.560 --> 1:51:50.560]  Absolutely
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:52.560]  So let me just say
[1:51:52.560 --> 1:51:53.560]  Income, one word
[1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.560]  That definition is 60 pages
[1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:56.560]  Of the tax code
[1:51:56.560 --> 1:51:58.560]  So there you go
[1:51:58.560 --> 1:52:00.560]  Not to mention the regulations
[1:52:00.560 --> 1:52:02.560]  But you eat, drink, and sleep
[1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:03.560]  I call you at 2 a.m. you answer
[1:52:03.560 --> 1:52:04.560]  You eat, drink, and sleep
[1:52:04.560 --> 1:52:05.560]  To the son of your other lawyers
[1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:06.560]  And ZBAs
[1:52:06.560 --> 1:52:08.560]  You guys are on the cutting edge
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:09.560]  Because, again, they changed
[1:52:09.560 --> 1:52:10.560]  Every year or two
[1:52:10.560 --> 1:52:11.560]  So the general public doesn't get it
[1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:12.560]  You're with the new thing
[1:52:12.560 --> 1:52:14.560]  So the truth is this is very easy
[1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:15.560]  But you're gonna have to change it
[1:52:15.560 --> 1:52:16.560]  Every year or two
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:17.560]  Exactly
[1:52:17.560 --> 1:52:19.560]  And that's where good
[1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:22.560]  Intending tax firms fall behind
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:24.560]  Because they're not up to date
[1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560]  On the tax changes
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:28.560]  Every year, every few years
[1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:29.560]  Right?
[1:52:29.560 --> 1:52:30.560]  You know, if you've got crypto
[1:52:30.560 --> 1:52:32.560]  Ask yourself, can your account
[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:33.560]  And spell Ethereum?
[1:52:33.560 --> 1:52:35.560]  If not, you probably have to run
[1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:36.560]  Against other tax firms
[1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:38.560]  I called YouTube
[1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:39.560]  But I called like four others
[1:52:39.560 --> 1:52:40.560]  They're like, how do they know
[1:52:40.560 --> 1:52:42.560]  You've got millions of donations
[1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:44.560]  They don't even know what blockchain is
[1:52:44.560 --> 1:52:45.560]  Right
[1:52:45.560 --> 1:52:46.560]  So I'm explaining to them what it is
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:47.560]  Right
[1:52:47.560 --> 1:52:49.560]  And so that's not a good situation
[1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:51.560]  When your tax guy knows less
[1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:53.560]  About crypto and DeFi than you do
[1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:55.560]  And what that also means
[1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:56.560]  Is they're scared of it
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:57.560]  Just like the IRS
[1:52:57.560 --> 1:53:00.560]  When the IRS has labeled anyone
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:02.560]  Who has crypto a criminal
[1:53:02.560 --> 1:53:04.560]  In their news press release
[1:53:04.560 --> 1:53:07.560]  You know, your average tax firm
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:10.560]  And you know, not talking any crap
[1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.560]  They are risk adverse
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.560]  And they do not want you to have
[1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:15.560]  An audit or them to get audited
[1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:16.560]  Because that's going to hurt them
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:17.560]  But you get protected
[1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:19.560]  By having a law firm like yours behind you
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:20.560]  Yes, so what they do
[1:53:20.560 --> 1:53:22.560]  You guys write a letter, you certify it
[1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:25.560]  They overcompensate
[1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:27.560]  And in the essence, you lose money
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:29.560]  Deductions you could have had
[1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:31.560]  Because they don't want to be
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:32.560]  An advocate for you
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:33.560]  They just want to
[1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:34.560]  And that's the reason I get you on
[1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:36.560]  Because this is so solution-based
[1:53:36.560 --> 1:53:37.560]  And it's all right there
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:38.560]  Yeah, listen
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:39.560]  It's in the taxpayer bill of rights
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:42.560]  Not to pay a dime more than you owe
[1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:43.560]  And so, listen
[1:53:43.560 --> 1:53:45.560]  We'll take the IRS to court
[1:53:45.560 --> 1:53:46.560]  If they want us to
[1:53:46.560 --> 1:53:47.560]  Well, just off record
[1:53:47.560 --> 1:53:48.560]  I don't want to say the name of the firm
[1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:49.560]  But I believe you
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:50.560]  I know you're great
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:51.560]  That's why you're a sponsor
[1:53:51.560 --> 1:53:52.560]  But months ago
[1:53:52.560 --> 1:53:53.560]  When this all started happening
[1:53:53.560 --> 1:53:54.560]  Donations of crypto
[1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:56.560]  I went to one of the other big firms in stone
[1:53:56.560 --> 1:53:57.560]  And I said, here's the plan I've been given
[1:53:57.560 --> 1:53:59.560]  They said, yeah, that's a debt on plan
[1:53:59.560 --> 1:54:00.560]  What you recommended
[1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:01.560]  It's just debt on
[1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:03.560]  I mean, listen
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:05.560]  But other lawyers
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:06.560]  And they're like
[1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:07.560]  I'm not being mean
[1:54:07.560 --> 1:54:08.560]  They just
[1:54:08.560 --> 1:54:09.560]  That's there in the old world
[1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:10.560]  They're like dinosaurs
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:12.560]  That's what I was saying before
[1:54:12.560 --> 1:54:13.560]  So, I mean
[1:54:13.560 --> 1:54:14.560]  These people went to college
[1:54:14.560 --> 1:54:15.560]  And stuff
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  And they think, you know what
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:18.560]  It's the law's not going to change that much
[1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:21.560]  And I can just continue going forward
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:22.560]  Well, you can
[1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  But you're going to end up paying the IRS
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:25.560]  More than you need to
[1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:26.560]  Because the laws
[1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:28.560]  The munitia changes every year
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  And we have to be up to date on that
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:31.560]  Like, for example
[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:35.560]  The $650 filing requirement for Etsy, eBay
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:36.560]  That kind of thing
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  That's a direct attack on the middle class
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:39.560]  And if you talk about that
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:41.560]  Anything like $600 or more
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:43.560]  Biden once reported
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  Right, so
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:47.560]  There's this concept called the tax gap
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:49.560]  That is the difference between
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:51.560]  The amount of money that the United States spends
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:53.560]  And the amount of money that it generates
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:54.560]  In tax revenue
[1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.560]  Now, if we were just to tax
[1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  The globalist half a percent more
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:01.560]  The entire tax gap would close
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:03.560]  But instead, of course
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:05.560]  Because we're not part of their cabal
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:06.560]  They said, hey
[1:55:06.560 --> 1:55:08.560]  Let's tax good old mom and pop
[1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:10.560]  Who made $1,000 selling
[1:55:10.560 --> 1:55:12.560]  Who they said were non-essential
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:13.560]  They're at war with the middle class
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:14.560]  Right, they are
[1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:16.560]  They want the middle class
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:19.560]  To be depleting of their savings accounts
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:21.560]  And be completely
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:23.560]  Relying upon the government forever
[1:55:23.560 --> 1:55:24.560]  Well Schwab admits that
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:25.560]  Here's a few headlines, AP
[1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  Inflation divide
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:27.560]  The wealthy splurge
[1:55:27.560 --> 1:55:28.560]  The poorest pull back
[1:55:28.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  They're using all their fiat currency
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:31.560]  Byverting up, AP
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:32.560]  Wall Street Journal
[1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:33.560]  Individual income tax payments
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:35.560]  On pace to reach record level
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:37.560]  So the globalists pay almost nothing
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:38.560]  1% on average
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:40.560]  The average person's paying record level
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:41.560]  That's not fair
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:43.560]  And it's all in the code
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:45.560]  Absolutely, and one of the main reasons
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:47.560]  For that is individuals
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:48.560]  You and me
[1:55:48.560 --> 1:55:50.560]  We have a graduated tax code
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:52.560]  That means as inflation makes
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:53.560]  More money available
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:55.560]  We are going to pay more of that
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  As a percentage
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  The bottom line is survived during this
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:55:59.560]  Inflation attack
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  People better use the establishment's
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  Loopholes now or they're done
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  Corporations and trust is the name of the game
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:06.560]  So this is survival folks
[1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  That's why I'm all about solutions
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:09.560]  I'm all about victory
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:10.560]  It's why we're doing this

[2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:03.560]  It's never going to get me better
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:04.560]  Don't look for it
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:06.560]  Be happy with what you got
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:09.560]  Because the owners of this country
[2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:10.560]  Don't want that
[2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:12.560]  I'm talking about the real owners now
[2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:13.560]  The real owners
[2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:15.560]  The big wealthy business
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:16.560]  And just to control things
[2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:18.560]  And make all the important decisions
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:20.560]  Forget the politicians
[2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:21.560]  The politicians are put there
[2:00:21.560 --> 2:00:22.560]  To give you the idea
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:24.560]  That you have freedom of choice
[2:00:24.560 --> 2:00:25.560]  You don't
[2:00:25.560 --> 2:00:27.560]  You have no choice
[2:00:27.560 --> 2:00:28.560]  You have owners
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:30.560]  They own you
[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:32.560]  They own everything
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:34.560]  They own all the important things
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.560]  They own and control the corporations
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:37.560]  They've long since bought and paid
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:38.560]  For the Senate, the Congress
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:39.560]  The city halls
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.560]  They got the judges in their back pockets
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:42.560]  And they own all the big media companies
[2:00:42.560 --> 2:00:44.560]  So they control just about all the news
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:45.560]  And information you get to hear
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:48.560]  They got you by the balls
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:51.560]  They want obedient workers
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  Obedient workers
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:54.560]  People who are just smart enough
[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:55.560]  To run the machines
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:56.560]  And do the paperwork
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:00:57.560]  And just dumb enough
[2:00:57.560 --> 2:00:59.560]  To passively accept jobs
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:00.560]  With the lower pay
[2:01:00.560 --> 2:01:01.560]  The longer hours
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:02.560]  The reduced benefits
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:03.560]  The end of overtime
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:04.560]  And the vanishing pension
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:06.560]  That disappears the minute you go to collect it
[2:01:06.560 --> 2:01:09.560]  And now they're coming for your social security money
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:11.560]  So they can give it to their criminal friends
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:13.560]  On Wall Street
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:15.560]  It's a big club
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:16.560]  And you ain't in it
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:17.560]  And you said recently
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:19.560]  When you give
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:22.560]  They do whatever the hell you want them to do
[2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:23.560]  You better believe it
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:25.560]  So what specifically did they do?
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:26.560]  If I ask them
[2:01:26.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  If I need them
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:29.560]  Most of the people on this stage
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:30.560]  I've given to
[2:01:30.560 --> 2:01:31.560]  Just so you understand
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:32.560]  A lot of money
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  You and I are not in the big club
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:37.560]  The owners of this country know the truth
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  It's called the American Dream
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  Because you have to be asleep to believe it
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:44.560]  But I'll tell you what they don't want
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:47.560]  They don't want a population of citizens
[2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:48.560]  Capable of critical thinking
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:51.560]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:52.560]  Capable of critical thinking
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:53.560]  They're not interested in that
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:54.560]  That doesn't help them
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:56.560]  That's against their interest
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:57.560]  That's right
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:02:00.560]  From the front lines of the Information War
[2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:03.560]  It's Alex Jones
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:05.560]  And everything we cover here
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:06.560]  Is giving you the secrets
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:07.560]  Of how they're screwing you
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:09.560]  Because we are not with the globalist
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:10.560]  We are with the people
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:12.560]  We are with our children
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:13.560]  Tyler Bennett
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:14.560]  We're going to break here in a few minutes
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:15.560]  We're going to come back with calls
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:16.560]  But other key points
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:17.560]  Well, I just want to say that
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:19.560]  You know, that George Carlin clip
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:20.560]  Is so salient
[2:02:20.560 --> 2:02:22.560]  Because 25, 30 years ago
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:23.560]  He's saying
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:25.560]  They're going to come after your social security
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:27.560]  Well, they've already done that, right?
[2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:30.560]  And if you make more than $25,000
[2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:32.560]  On top of your social security
[2:02:32.560 --> 2:02:34.560]  They're going to tax it 50%
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:35.560]  And the more you make, they'll start taxing
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:37.560]  More and more of your social security
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:39.560]  And it's absurd and ridiculous
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:41.560]  That you paid into the system
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:43.560]  And they're going to tax you for it
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:44.560]  So give us a call
[2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:46.560]  We can help out with people on a W-2
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  1099, whatever
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:49.560]  You're paying too much to the government
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:50.560]  Stop it
[2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:53.560]  And they're maneuvering us
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:54.560]  Where we play by their games
[2:02:54.560 --> 2:02:56.560]  We're going to go bankrupt
[2:02:56.560 --> 2:02:57.560]  And be insolvent
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  Where they want to control us
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:01.560]  That's why everybody has to do this
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:02.560]  That's absolutely correct, Alex
[2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:05.560]  Because we all know that the grand scheme
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:06.560]  Of the plan here
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:09.560]  Is to divest the middle class from all its wealth
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:12.560]  So they will not be able to combat
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:14.560]  They won't be in a financial position
[2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:16.560]  This is why they're coming after your guns, too
[2:03:16.560 --> 2:03:18.560]  So that you can't combat what happens
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:20.560]  And you'll be forced to comply
[2:03:20.560 --> 2:03:22.560]  And you'll have nothing
[2:03:22.560 --> 2:03:23.560]  You'll own nothing
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:24.560]  And you'll be happy
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  And you're about in the next hour delay
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:28.560]  All that out with phone calls

[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:43.560]  You are insane
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:45.560]  You are letting them screw you over
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:46.560]  If you don't use the law
[2:03:46.560 --> 2:03:47.560]  They actually wrote
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:49.560]  That the regular CPAs and lawyers
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:51.560]  Are four, five, six, seven, ten years behind
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:52.560]  Some of them covering something
[2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:54.560]  They did 20 years ago in college
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:55.560]  And not even telling you
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:57.560]  How they write new loopholes every year
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:03:59.560]  And change them within 18 months
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:01.560]  For themselves
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:03.560]  Use the law for yourself

[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:11.560]  The most important call you can make
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:13.560]  Financially during this inflation
[2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:16.560]  This economic attack is 833-900-4285
[2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:18.560]  Or Jonestaxforleaf.com
[2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:20.560]  I am so passionate about this
[2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  Because I am sick of them
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:24.560]  Using their fraudulent system
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:26.560]  Against the people
[2:04:26.560 --> 2:04:30.560]  833-900-4285

[2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:36.560]  And your phone calls on the other side
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:38.560]  I tell you, when we archive this
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:39.560]  At Band-Aid video today

[2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:41.560]  And put it on the front
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:42.560]  Because you knocked it out of the park
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:44.560]  And so did George Carlin
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:46.560]  Stay with us, your phone calls

[2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:57.560]  Tune in and share this knowledge
[2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:59.560]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:00.560]  Or pump gas
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:01.560]  Or whether you're a farmer
[2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:03.560]  Or rancher, a doctor, a lawyer
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:04.560]  Or a millionaire
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:05.560]  Fortune and Money Magazine
[2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:07.560]  Have all done these profiles
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:08.560]  You see it every year
[2:05:08.560 --> 2:05:09.560]  30 different tax returns
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:10.560]  30 different answers
[2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:12.560]  50 different tax returns
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:13.560]  50 different answers
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:14.560]  And almost all of them
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:16.560]  Just screw you over
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:17.560]  Especially the big firms
[2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:18.560]  And the big tax groups
[2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:20.560]  Because they're part of the system
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:21.560]  And they don't want the general public
[2:05:21.560 --> 2:05:23.560]  Understanding this and knowing this show
[2:05:23.560 --> 2:05:25.560]  It's a very important situation
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:26.560]  With inflation
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:28.560]  And all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:05:28.560 --> 2:05:31.560]  To be able to do things tax wise
[2:05:31.560 --> 2:05:33.560]  It's legal and lawful
[2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:34.560]  That allows you to keep more of your money
[2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:35.560]  We wouldn't even be here
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:37.560]  If I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:39.560]  In the last few years
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:41.560]  The only way you fail
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.560]  Is not writing down the URL
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:45.560]  Jonestaxrelief.com
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.560]  One word, Jonestaxrelief.com
[2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:50.560]  Or call 833-900-4285

[2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:21.560]  And here we are
[2:06:21.560 --> 2:06:22.560]  Yet again
[2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:23.560]  Living through that cycle
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:25.560]  This Monday, June 6, 2022 broadcast

[2:06:33.560 --> 2:06:36.560]  We're about to go to the phone calls, my friend
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:38.560]  Answer tax questions
[2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:39.560]  I'm excited
[2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:41.560]  Let's spend a few minutes before we do that
[2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:42.560]  About the services at
[2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:44.560]  Jonestaxrelief.com

[2:06:48.560 --> 2:06:50.560]  But you guys can do so much
[2:06:50.560 --> 2:06:52.560]  It's not just a tax season situation
[2:06:52.560 --> 2:06:53.560]  It's not
[2:06:53.560 --> 2:06:55.560]  And there is a multitude of
[2:06:55.560 --> 2:06:56.560]  Services we provide
[2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:58.560]  But in order to make it
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Easy to understand
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:02.560]  There is pretty much three areas
[2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:04.560]  In the tax world, okay
[2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:05.560]  There is the present
[2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:07.560]  That's doing your tax return this year
[2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:09.560]  There is the future
[2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:10.560]  Which is making sure you pay
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:12.560]  The least amount of taxes possible
[2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:14.560]  Through entities, corporations, trusts
[2:07:14.560 --> 2:07:15.560]  And whatnot
[2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:16.560]  And there's the past
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:18.560]  Which means you're already
[2:07:18.560 --> 2:07:19.560]  In a hole
[2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:20.560]  And you can't afford to pay
[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  What they claim you owe
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:23.560]  And you need protection
[2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  Absolutely
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:26.560]  So you've got bookkeeping
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:27.560]  You've got business consulting
[2:07:27.560 --> 2:07:29.560]  You've got business entity selection
[2:07:29.560 --> 2:07:30.560]  You've got state and trust
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:31.560]  Tracks preparation
[2:07:31.560 --> 2:07:33.560]  You've got financial statements
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:34.560]  You've got IRS representation

[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:39.560]  Sales tax services, tax preparation and planning
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:41.560]  Tax levies, liens release
[2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:42.560]  Was that key
[2:07:42.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  Wage, garnishment release
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:46.560]  In penalties and interest
[2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:47.560]  Oh, that's key
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:49.560]  Tax negotiation settlement
[2:07:49.560 --> 2:07:50.560]  Reduce IRS tax fee
[2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.560]  Resolve back taxes

[2:07:56.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  At jonestaxrelief.com
[2:07:59.560 --> 2:08:01.560]  All right, let's go to the phone calls here
[2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:02.560]  In the order
[2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:04.560]  These amazing calls have been received
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:07.560]  Let's talk to Susan in California
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:09.560]  Susan, you're on the air
[2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:10.560]  With Tyler Bennett
[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:12.560]  Alex, God bless you
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:14.560]  And God bless you, Tyler
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:15.560]  Thank you
[2:08:15.560 --> 2:08:17.560]  I'm a small business owner
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:21.560]  I have an LLC acting as a partnership
[2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:23.560]  I have worked for one year
[2:08:23.560 --> 2:08:25.560]  To get a trademark
[2:08:25.560 --> 2:08:27.560]  I have a trademark
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:29.560]  They're telling me if I convert
[2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:31.560]  To an S-Corp or a C-Corp
[2:08:31.560 --> 2:08:34.560]  I may lose my trademark
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:35.560]  You guys handle that?
[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  We do
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:38.560]  So let me ask you a question, Susan
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:42.560]  Is most have been a multi-member LLC
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:44.560]  If you're being treated as a partnership?
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:45.560]  Correct
[2:08:45.560 --> 2:08:47.560]  Okay, so who's your partner?
[2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:49.560]  I mean, is it your husband
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:51.560]  Or is it someone not in your family?
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:53.560]  No, it's a producing partner
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:54.560]  I work in Los Angeles
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  It's a production company
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:58.560]  Okay, so that's where a little bit
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:00.560]  Of this wrinkle is
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:02.560]  Because partnerships are flow-through entities
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:04.560]  On the federal level
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:06.560]  You have to deal with both your taxes
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:08.560]  And your partner's taxes
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  And that's why you're telling me right now
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:12.560]  You want to get into a corporate setup
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:15.560]  Because that prevents any kind of
[2:09:15.560 --> 2:09:16.560]  Overpayment of taxes
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:17.560]  She needs a reorganization
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:19.560]  That's exactly what she needs
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  But she's concerned about the trademark
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.560]  Being able to go to the new company
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  And we can help with that
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:27.560]  That's a federal level
[2:09:27.560 --> 2:09:29.560]  See, corporations, partnerships
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:31.560]  All entities exist on the state level
[2:09:31.560 --> 2:09:33.560]  However, copyright is a federal issue
[2:09:33.560 --> 2:09:35.560]  And so we just need to talk to the right people
[2:09:35.560 --> 2:09:36.560]  And get it going
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:39.560]  Because, yes, once the ownership
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:41.560]  Of that trademark is distinguished
[2:09:41.560 --> 2:09:43.560]  Because the partnership is half you
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:45.560]  Half the production company
[2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  That's the wrinkle right now
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:49.560]  And that's why I would tell anybody
[2:09:49.560 --> 2:09:51.560]  Who wants to be a partner
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:53.560]  Go into business with a partner
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:09:54.560]  Don't be a partnership
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  Be a corporation straight off the bat
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.560]  That way you have an equal amount of stock
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:00.560]  Or however you want to decide it
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:01.560]  And the IRS isn't going to tell you
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:03.560]  How much you have to pay in taxes
[2:10:03.560 --> 2:10:05.560]  You're going to decide that
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  You've got it
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:08.560]  And I'm a proud member of the CUT
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:09.560]  Pays the stumble
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:10.560]  That's right
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:11.560]  That's right
[2:10:11.560 --> 2:10:12.560]  Keep it up
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:15.560]  So generally, you don't want to be in partnerships
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:16.560]  What do you just call it?
[2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:17.560]  Is contract agreement?
[2:10:17.560 --> 2:10:20.560]  Well, so a partnership is
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.560]  A common law entity, Alex
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:24.560]  So if you are just, if me and you decide
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:26.560]  Hey, let's go into business right now
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:29.560]  But we don't actually create any legal documents
[2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.560]  We're going to be considered a partnership
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:32.560]  On the state level
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:35.560]  And the federal level is just going to disregard that
[2:10:35.560 --> 2:10:38.560]  And tax us both individually on our 1040s
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:41.560]  And so because of that
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:44.560]  If you have a partner that, let's say
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  Took more than in distributions
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:48.560]  Or took less than distributions
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:50.560]  It doesn't matter, at the end of the day
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:51.560]  You're going to get taxed
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  The point is, she sends you her info
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:54.560]  You can give her a quick assessment
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:55.560]  Absolutely, Susan
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:57.560]  So I got people standing by right now
[2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:01.560]  We can give you absolutely a consultation
[2:11:01.560 --> 2:11:02.560]  And get you into business
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:03.560]  And notice, Susan, he right away
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:04.560]  To everything you were talking about
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:05.560]  God bless you, we love you
[2:11:05.560 --> 2:11:07.560]  Alright, let's talk to Josh in Texas
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:09.560]  Josh, go ahead, sir
[2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:12.560]  Yeah, first of all, my dad
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:14.560]  Who worked for himself
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:17.560]  He successfully and legally approved himself
[2:11:17.560 --> 2:11:19.560]  To never pay an income tax
[2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:21.560]  Because there is no law that says
[2:11:21.560 --> 2:11:23.560]  In America, in the private sector
[2:11:23.560 --> 2:11:25.560]  A business has to file a 1040
[2:11:25.560 --> 2:11:27.560]  Oh, yeah, there are a lot of people
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:29.560]  That end up never even paying anything
[2:11:29.560 --> 2:11:31.560]  Tyler, I see you nodding
[2:11:31.560 --> 2:11:33.560]  I'm sorry, keep going, Josh
[2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  Well, also, under the article 6209
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  It also says that the IRS
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.560]  Is a British Monarch Collection Agency
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:42.560]  So why are we telling people
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.560]  That they should file a 1040
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:45.560]  When we should be telling people
[2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:47.560]  That they shouldn't pay income tax at all
[2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:49.560]  When the law doesn't even exist
[2:11:49.560 --> 2:11:50.560]  Well, here's the deal, Josh
[2:11:50.560 --> 2:11:52.560]  I foreshadowed this earlier
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:54.560]  You have the globalists that pay no tax
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:55.560]  And run the system
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:56.560]  They have the loopholes they've written
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:11:57.560]  For all their minions
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:11:59.560]  We're talking about how within the system
[2:11:59.560 --> 2:12:00.560]  To do that
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:02.560]  Some people decide not to do it
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:03.560]  But I can tell you
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  You got a bunch of employees
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:05.560]  You're on a big operation
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:06.560]  They're gonna come after you
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:08.560]  You're like, well, they're a fraud
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:10.560]  Yeah, and they got federal grand juries
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  That'll indict you and put you in jail
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  And so we're being completely honest
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:15.560]  That it's all a fraud
[2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:16.560]  The 60th Amendment's a fraud
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:17.560]  We don't believe in any of it
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:19.560]  We're talking about the other path
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:21.560]  Of mitigating it massively
[2:12:21.560 --> 2:12:23.560]  Or you can go the way you've gone
[2:12:23.560 --> 2:12:25.560]  So I'm not debating what you're saying
[2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:27.560]  But yes, you are correct, Josh
[2:12:27.560 --> 2:12:29.560]  There are many inconsistencies
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.560]  From the 16th Amendment onward
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  That you could say invalidate
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:36.560]  Your obligation to pay taxes
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:38.560]  However, all of these issues
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:40.560]  Have already been litigated
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:42.560]  By, guess who, the IRS
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:44.560]  In their favor
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.560]  And these specific arguments
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:48.560]  Are called tax protester arguments
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  If you assert this
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:51.560]  And don't pay your taxes
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:53.560]  You're gonna get hit with a penalty and a fine
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:55.560]  Is it right? No, but listen
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  Like Alex said, we have to exist
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:12:59.560]  In the world that we live in
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:01.560]  Because we're not globalists, okay
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:03.560]  And so let me tell you
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:05.560]  If you want to sue the government
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:07.560]  Because you don't believe that
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:08.560]  The tax you paid is right
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:10.560]  The proper venue to do it
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:12.560]  Is to pay the tax and then sue the government
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:14.560]  You may actually win
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  The crypto-tezos guys won that way
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:18.560]  They paid the tax and then sued the government
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  Do not pay your taxes
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:22.560]  Because you don't believe
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  Some people can fly on the radar
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:26.560]  And never do it, illegal aliens don't do it
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  All I'm saying is
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  I'm not gonna give advice out on air
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:32.560]  On how you should never pay any of these taxes
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:34.560]  Of course they're a fraud, okay
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  All we're saying is
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:38.560]  Here's the way the elites don't
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  Not pay it and use
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:42.560]  The British common law, magistrate
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:44.560]  Governor general
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:46.560]  Crown argument
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:48.560]  They just write the loopholes and don't do it
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:50.560]  So if your thing was the best
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  They don't use that
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:54.560]  And the reason is if you type in IRS
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:56.560]  Frivolous arguments into Google right now
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:13:58.560]  The thing you just mentioned
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  Both of them will show up
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.560]  Because the IRS has already litigated it
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:04.560]  I would never steer my audience
[2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:06.560]  You could go to Mexico by a car
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:08.560]  With a Mexican plate, get a Mexican ID
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.560]  And say you're Juan Sanchez
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:12.560]  And you might actually live your life pretty good
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:14.560]  If you just run a restaurant
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:16.560]  Or mow yards or whatever and never pay taxes
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:18.560]  If that's what you want to do, do it
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:20.560]  I'm talking about people that are raped by the CPAs
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:22.560]  Rape by the lawyers
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:24.560]  Who are going to go along with the system
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:26.560]  Well, no, there's these loopholes for you
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:28.560]  We're giving people that option, you understand
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  We're giving options here, sir
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:32.560]  Yeah, I do, but I just think
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:34.560]  You know, we all know in the Constitution
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:36.560]  That income tax is a third form
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  Of taxation and completely
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:40.560]  Unapportioned and unconstitutional
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:42.560]  None of you are allowed to make you waive your rights
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  To Fifth Amendment violations
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:46.560]  And Fourth Amendment violations and all of them
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  I get all that
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  You understand what we're doing is a separate thing
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  From the whole
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:54.560]  Patriot movement and what they say
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:56.560]  And a lot of the stuff they say is true
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:58.560]  But most people end up getting in a lot of trouble doing that
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:00.560]  Yes, I agree with the
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:02.560]  Patriot movement's view on taxes
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:04.560]  But I exist in this world
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:06.560]  We're not of the globalist class
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:08.560]  We're not of the IRS's class
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:10.560]  They are city hall
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:12.560]  And they make the rules
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:14.560]  We're trying to show you the tricks the elites use
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:16.560]  Patriot arguments
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:18.560]  Of course
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:20.560]  Of course the New World Order
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:22.560]  And all the system
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:24.560]  And it's all a fraud
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:26.560]  We're not debating that, we're saying
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:28.560]  How does the establishment avoid it
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:30.560]  Where they don't go to jail
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:32.560]  We're not creating our own new system
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:34.560]  They write the law to get out of it
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  Absolutely correct
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:38.560]  So we know that the law has
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:40.560]  It's like a video game that has a cheat sheet code
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:42.560]  Exactly
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.560]  And you can always not play the game
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:46.560]  But you're here
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:48.560]  Thank you sir, and I knew we'd get those calls
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:50.560]  I'm not mad at Josh
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:52.560]  Very legitimate, that's why we're with
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:54.560]  They get all of that
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:56.560]  Weird
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:00.560]  Info Wars has made history
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:02.560]  You have made history in your support
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:04.560]  Of Info Wars
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:06.560]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:08.560]  Circumvent and override the censors
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:10.560]  Has been Patriot apparel
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:12.560]  And identify each other so we can spread the word
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:14.560]  And so we can push people to websites
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:16.560]  Like infowars.com
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:18.560]  So they can understand the globalist plan
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:20.560]  And how to stop it
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:22.560]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:24.560]  We're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:26.560]  Some of which go back more than 25 years
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:28.560]  All these shirts are limited edition
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:30.560]  They are about to be history
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:32.560]  And will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:34.560]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:36.560]  Of 60 plus thousand left
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:38.560]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:40.560]  We're selling them all at cost

[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.560]  The InfoWars operation

[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:45.560]  The only way you fail is by not taking action

[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:26.560]  And because of this platform
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:29.560]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[2:19:29.560 --> 2:19:30.560]  If it weren't for Alex Jones
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:32.560]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:34.560]  With Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim Cass
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:36.560]  The super Tim Cass IRL
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:38.560]  Listen, what I'm saying is
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:41.560]  Do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted
[2:19:41.560 --> 2:19:44.560]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:47.560]  We need to support free speech systems right now
[2:19:47.560 --> 2:19:48.560]  So go check out the store
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:49.560]  Go support their store
[2:19:49.560 --> 2:19:51.560]  Go support InfoWars
[2:19:51.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  Leave a donation right now
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:54.560]  Don't wait until they're gone
[2:19:57.560 --> 2:20:00.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:00.560 --> 2:20:02.560]  Of the New World Order
[2:20:02.560 --> 2:20:30.560]  It's Alex Jones
[2:20:30.560 --> 2:20:32.560]  The articles that Jeff Bezos last year
[2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:34.560]  Made something like $40 million in memory serves
[2:20:34.560 --> 2:20:36.560]  And he paid zero tax
[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:38.560]  Elon Musk, because he's not part of the establishment now
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:40.560]  I'm not saying he's perfect
[2:20:40.560 --> 2:20:42.560]  He had to pay $16 million
[2:20:42.560 --> 2:20:44.560]  That was still a small amount of his profit
[2:20:44.560 --> 2:20:47.560]  The Google pays less than 1% a year
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:50.560]  They don't use, oh, the British Crown controls America
[2:20:50.560 --> 2:20:54.560]  And, you know, these UCC filings and all this
[2:20:54.560 --> 2:20:56.560]  That works for a lot of people
[2:20:56.560 --> 2:20:57.560]  Because the system's overwhelmed
[2:20:57.560 --> 2:20:59.560]  And it is all about self-compliance
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:01.560]  And about making you wave your rights
[2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:02.560]  We get all that
[2:21:02.560 --> 2:21:03.560]  We're not defending the system
[2:21:03.560 --> 2:21:05.560]  We're saying you could be a globalist
[2:21:05.560 --> 2:21:06.560]  Which none of us are
[2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:08.560]  Or you could know their loopholes
[2:21:08.560 --> 2:21:09.560]  To protect yourself 90%
[2:21:09.560 --> 2:21:11.560]  Or you could be a schmuck
[2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:12.560]  And do everything they say
[2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:13.560]  And follow along with it
[2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:15.560]  Or you can just go rogue
[2:21:15.560 --> 2:21:17.560]  Which I kind of admire people that are doing that
[2:21:17.560 --> 2:21:18.560]  I mean, the system's rogue
[2:21:18.560 --> 2:21:20.560]  It's broken the social contract
[2:21:20.560 --> 2:21:21.560]  It's totally out of control
[2:21:21.560 --> 2:21:22.560]  The border's completely collapsed
[2:21:22.560 --> 2:21:23.560]  They're shipping fentanyl in
[2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:25.560]  They got pedophile drag queen story time
[2:21:25.560 --> 2:21:27.560]  I'm not judging you
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:31.560]  We're here talking about what the establishment does
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:32.560]  To protect themselves
[2:21:32.560 --> 2:21:34.560]  Because they're not using the patriot model
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:35.560]  Tyler Bennett
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.560]  I agree, because, look
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:39.560]  I don't want to give any of my money
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:41.560]  More than I have to to the government
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:43.560]  That's doing things that I disagree with, right?
[2:21:43.560 --> 2:21:46.560]  But the tax loopholes that were put in place
[2:21:46.560 --> 2:21:50.560]  That we use, that the globalists use
[2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:53.560]  Are they put in place and exist
[2:21:53.560 --> 2:21:55.560]  That you must know where they are
[2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:57.560]  These types of...
[2:21:57.560 --> 2:21:59.560]  The IRS is not a legitimate organization
[2:21:59.560 --> 2:22:00.560]  Of U.S. government
[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:03.560]  Or they can't tax me for this reason, that reason
[2:22:03.560 --> 2:22:05.560]  Those are what's called tax protester arguments
[2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:07.560]  And I would say that's a red herring
[2:22:07.560 --> 2:22:08.560]  That the IRS put in the code
[2:22:08.560 --> 2:22:12.560]  Because they want you to make those assertions
[2:22:12.560 --> 2:22:14.560]  So that then they can come back
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:16.560]  And penalize you 100% penalty
[2:22:16.560 --> 2:22:17.560]  For making what's known as...
[2:22:17.560 --> 2:22:19.560]  That's right, they don't want you to know the information
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:21.560]  We're laying out there, folks
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:23.560]  And again, if people want to completely go rogue
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:24.560]  And everything more power to you
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:27.560]  We're talking about, I'm not going to steer listeners
[2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:29.560]  Into a fight with the globalist mafia
[2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:31.560]  I'm going to give you the secrets
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:32.560]  Of the cheat codes they've got
[2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:34.560]  Exactly, and you got to remember
[2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:36.560]  There's a 1 out of 200 chance
[2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:37.560]  Every year of being audited
[2:22:37.560 --> 2:22:39.560]  That's just the reality of the situation
[2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:41.560]  So a lot of people do crazy things
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:42.560]  And get away with it for some time
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:45.560]  But eventually the dice will roll your nose
[2:22:45.560 --> 2:22:46.560]  That's right, I don't need that in my life
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:47.560]  Like Tony Montana says
[2:22:47.560 --> 2:22:49.560]  I'm not going to kill this guy and his daughters
[2:22:49.560 --> 2:22:50.560]  He doesn't need that in his life
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:52.560]  I'm not going to steer you into BS
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:54.560]  Or like certain people saying
[2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.560]  Oh, we got the voting machine proof
[2:22:56.560 --> 2:22:58.560]  Trouble me back in August
[2:22:58.560 --> 2:23:00.560]  Sure, that was popular while they were saying it
[2:23:00.560 --> 2:23:02.560]  But it wasn't real
[2:23:02.560 --> 2:23:04.560]  I'm in the long haul here, folks
[2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:06.560]  I'm not here to screw you over
[2:23:06.560 --> 2:23:10.560]  I would rather die than give you bad advice
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:12.560]  And it's true because
[2:23:12.560 --> 2:23:14.560]  Just like making money, right?
[2:23:14.560 --> 2:23:17.560]  It's a quick, quick money to be made
[2:23:17.560 --> 2:23:18.560]  It's gone just like that
[2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:20.560]  But if you build a business
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:23.560]  And every day you put in your toil
[2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:24.560]  The sweat of your brow
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:26.560]  That's money that you're going to build up
[2:23:26.560 --> 2:23:27.560]  And build up and build up
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:29.560]  And so if these tax arguments are like that
[2:23:29.560 --> 2:23:31.560]  Sure, you might be able to get out of it
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:33.560]  For one or two years before they audit you
[2:23:33.560 --> 2:23:35.560]  And then you'll pay it all back
[2:23:35.560 --> 2:23:37.560]  But let's just build the ship correctly
[2:23:37.560 --> 2:23:38.560]  The first way
[2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:39.560]  So you're paying the least amount
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:41.560]  Yeah, they don't want people knowing the tricks they use
[2:23:41.560 --> 2:23:42.560]  That's right
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:44.560]  And I'm just trying to get patriots to realize this
[2:23:44.560 --> 2:23:46.560]  And I'm not knocking them for what they've done
[2:23:46.560 --> 2:23:48.560]  If they can be not part of the system
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:49.560]  We're power to them
[2:23:49.560 --> 2:23:50.560]  Absolutely
[2:23:50.560 --> 2:23:52.560]  I mean, if you can go off the grid and do that
[2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:53.560]  More power to you
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:54.560]  As a tax professional
[2:23:54.560 --> 2:23:58.560]  I cannot legally advise that you do that
[2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:00.560]  But I will make sure you're paying the least amount of money
[2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:02.560]  Well, it's like the mafia comes and says
[2:24:02.560 --> 2:24:03.560]  We'll burn down your grocery store
[2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:05.560]  If you don't hire our cousin and pay us money
[2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:07.560]  Yeah, it's right to stand up against them
[2:24:07.560 --> 2:24:09.560]  But is that the battle you're choosing?
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:10.560]  Right, exactly
[2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:13.560]  And the way we choose to fight that battle
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:15.560]  Is we will give to Caesar
[2:24:15.560 --> 2:24:16.560]  What is Caesar's
[2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:18.560]  But not one penny more
[2:24:18.560 --> 2:24:19.560]  We disagree with that
[2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:21.560]  And they've written the loopholes where you pay almost nothing
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:22.560]  All right, next up here
[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:24.560]  Let's move quick to these calls now
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:27.560]  Let's go ahead and talk to Josh in Florida
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:28.560]  Josh, welcome
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:30.560]  Hey, how are we doing?
[2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:31.560]  Great, great info
[2:24:31.560 --> 2:24:36.560]  This information is probably the most powerful
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:37.560]  To that last caller
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:41.560]  That was like a strongman argument
[2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:42.560]  Right
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:43.560]  We live in the real world
[2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:44.560]  We live in the real world
[2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:45.560]  And people like that are dangerous
[2:24:45.560 --> 2:24:48.560]  You could tell with his feminine crackling voice
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:51.560]  The only fight he's ever fought was in a chat room
[2:24:51.560 --> 2:24:54.560]  But anyway, let me process
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:59.560]  I've been a single member LLC since 2016
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:02.560]  And I'm in e-commerce as well
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:05.560]  I have my own screen printing business
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:07.560]  I sell on Etsy, Amazon, Shopify
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:08.560]  Okay
[2:25:08.560 --> 2:25:11.560]  Alex, I'd love to do some fulfillment
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:12.560]  If you need some weight
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:13.560]  Lift it off your shoulders
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:17.560]  But anyway, first couple years was good
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:20.560]  Now everything is getting harder
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:22.560]  And harder with profits
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:23.560]  Oh, yeah
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  I also have IT security certifications
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:33.560]  And I'm thinking about starting a consulting company
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:35.560]  So I have an LLC
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:38.560]  Now, if I start another entity
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:41.560]  How would I absorb the LLC?
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:43.560]  What's the best way?
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:44.560]  Ccore
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:46.560]  I'm sorry?
[2:25:46.560 --> 2:25:50.560]  Do you want to finish your question?
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:51.560]  Yeah, yeah
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:52.560]  So I was just saying
[2:25:52.560 --> 2:25:55.560]  I have a single member LLC now in e-commerce
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:25:58.560]  I'm thinking about switching to IT consulting
[2:25:58.560 --> 2:26:00.560]  Starting a new firm
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:03.560]  But I still want it all to be under one umbrella
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:04.560]  Right
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  And I'd like to know
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:08.560]  The name of the game here is because
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:12.560]  You can have, listen, when you have multiple different business ventures
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:14.560]  That's where LLC is coming to play
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:19.560]  Because you can have it all umbrella into your parent company
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.560]  Which I would suggest having a C corporation
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:24.560]  That way it's off your personal taxes altogether
[2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:26.560]  Pays a separate tax code
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  If the business, you know, heaven forbid fails
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:31.560]  It's not going to be your personal debt
[2:26:31.560 --> 2:26:33.560]  Either the tax debt or whatever
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:35.560]  So you just take the profit and pay tax on that
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:36.560]  But it's a separate thing
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:40.560]  This is something that the elite do all the time
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:42.560]  The top five Fortune 500 companies
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:46.560]  They routinely load up a corporation with debt
[2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:47.560]  And then just sync it
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  Because that's it
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:52.560]  A corporation is a separate taxpayer in the United States
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:55.560]  And the tax debt that it owes to Ccore
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:57.560]  Is not yours as an individual
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:26:59.560]  So Josh needs to call you
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:02.560]  You have a non-disclosure attorney club privilege
[2:27:02.560 --> 2:27:03.560]  They can give him real advice
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:06.560]  But yeah, Ccore brother, right?
[2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:07.560]  That's exactly right
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:11.560]  And for as many different business ventures as you have
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:13.560]  A separate LLC for each one
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:15.560]  Well, that's like these big, you know,
[2:27:15.560 --> 2:27:17.560]  $100 billion Hollywood companies
[2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:19.560]  Every film is a new Ccore
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:21.560]  And then whether it makes money or not
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:23.560]  It's for liability purposes
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:25.560]  See, when I started studying tax law
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:28.560]  I realized half of tax law is about paying the least amount
[2:27:28.560 --> 2:27:29.560]  To the government
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.560]  The other half is protecting your assets
[2:27:32.560 --> 2:27:33.560]  From anybody
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:35.560]  Your creditors, the IRS
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:37.560]  Well, that's like in this bankruptcy
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:38.560]  The sewers go
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:40.560]  Why do you have another corporation
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:41.560]  Runs the supplements?
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:42.560]  Because we went and got an FDA lawyer
[2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  That's what they said to do
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:44.560]  I mean
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:46.560]  Yeah, exactly
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:48.560]  Because at the end of the day
[2:27:48.560 --> 2:27:50.560]  If a bad, if it's a rainy day
[2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:53.560]  For one of your corporations, one of your LLCs
[2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:55.560]  Every other single one is still in operation
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:57.560]  And again, the globalists set this up
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.560]  Where they can win and then we lose
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:01.560]  Everything is about shutting us down
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:03.560]  Everything is about making us non-essential
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  If we just know their playbook
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:07.560]  And their tricks, they can't beat us
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:08.560]  That's exactly right
[2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:10.560]  And that's what we'll do for you
[2:28:10.560 --> 2:28:11.560]  Give me a call
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:12.560]  God bless you, sir
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:13.560]  Great points, Josh
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:14.560]  All right, we're going to go to break
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:16.560]  We're going to do 15 minutes the next hour
[2:28:16.560 --> 2:28:17.560]  So it's going to taste cool with that
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:19.560]  So I want to be able to take a lot of calls
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:21.560]  From Joshua
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:22.560]  And from Bill
[2:28:22.560 --> 2:28:23.560]  And from Kathy
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:24.560]  And from Tina
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:25.560]  And from Valerie
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:26.560]  And from Flex
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:27.560]  And from Jeremiah
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:28.560]  And from Tim
[2:28:28.560 --> 2:28:29.560]  And so many others
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:31.560]  Tole free number to join us
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:32.560]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:36.560]  It's 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex
[2:28:36.560 --> 2:28:38.560]  Nothing is more frustrating, folks
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:40.560]  Than knowing they've written a cope of themselves
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:42.560]  Like George Carlin said
[2:28:42.560 --> 2:28:43.560]  And we're not using it
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:45.560]  It's insane
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:46.560]  We'll be right back
[2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:48.560]  You need to learn this
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:49.560]  This is so powerful
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:50.560]  It's why I'm harping on it
[2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:52.560]  Tyler Bennett's our guest today with us
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:28:58.560]  I want to take a minute out
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:29:01.560]  To address the viewers and listeners of M4Wars
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.560]  And to remind you that we've been vindicated
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:05.560]  And that world government
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:07.560]  And its tyrannical aim of depopulation
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:09.560]  Is now out of the open
[2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.560]  Everything you and I have done together
[2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:13.560]  Has been distorted
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:15.560]  And we cannot continue in this fight
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:16.560]  Without your support
[2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:17.560]  I want to encourage you all

[2:29:56.560 --> 2:29:57.560]  You know, it's going back to
[2:29:57.560 --> 2:29:59.560]  What we all thought was going to happen
[2:29:59.560 --> 2:30:00.560]  In the 90s when the internet
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:02.560]  And mobile technology first came out
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:03.560]  Which is, we thought, you know,
[2:30:03.560 --> 2:30:05.560]  This is going to level the playing field
[2:30:05.560 --> 2:30:06.560]  Everybody's going to have access
[2:30:06.560 --> 2:30:07.560]  To the same information
[2:30:07.560 --> 2:30:08.560]  And everybody's going to be able
[2:30:08.560 --> 2:30:10.560]  To freely communicate that information
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:11.560]  That's our goal
[2:30:11.560 --> 2:30:13.560]  To get back to that place
[2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:15.560]  Where we all have access
[2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:16.560]  To all of the information
[2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:17.560]  We all have the ability
[2:30:17.560 --> 2:30:19.560]  To freely communicate that information
[2:30:19.560 --> 2:30:21.560]  With whomever we want
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:22.560]  Whenever we want
[2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:24.560]  And we don't have to worry about anybody
[2:30:24.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  Tracking what we're doing
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:27.560]  And trying to judge us
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:28.560]  Or categorize us
[2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:30.560]  Or figure out some way
[2:30:30.560 --> 2:30:31.560]  To go after us
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:33.560]  Because of the conversations
[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:34.560]  We're having
[2:30:34.560 --> 2:30:35.560]  Because of the internet searches
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:36.560]  That we're doing
[2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:38.560]  Because of the discussions
[2:30:38.560 --> 2:30:39.560]  The people we want to talk to
[2:30:39.560 --> 2:30:40.560]  About these things
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:42.560]  So that's our goal
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:43.560]  Is to help people take back
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:44.560]  Their freedom
[2:30:44.560 --> 2:30:45.560]  By helping them to take back
[2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:46.560]  Their privacy
[2:30:46.560 --> 2:30:47.560]  And so that's really what
[2:30:47.560 --> 2:30:48.560]  We're trying to do
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:50.560]  And so I hope that everybody
[2:30:50.560 --> 2:30:52.560]  Listening will check us out
[2:30:52.560 --> 2:30:53.560]  At boltowireless.com

[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:01.560]  And prayer.
[2:31:01.560 --> 2:31:03.560]  All the success that we've had
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:04.560]  Together against the globalists
[2:31:04.560 --> 2:31:05.560]  And the fact that we're not
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:07.560]  Caught flat-footed during
[2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:08.560]  Their major takeover
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:09.560]  Is because of you.
[2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.560]  Humanity has a real fighting
[2:31:11.560 --> 2:31:12.560]  Chance.

[2:31:17.560 --> 2:31:18.560]  And water filtration
[2:31:18.560 --> 2:31:19.560]  Air filtration is so much more
[2:31:19.560 --> 2:31:20.560]  But for those of you that want

[3:19:50.560 --> 3:20:18.560]  Thank you.
[3:20:18.560 --> 3:20:24.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:32.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente.
[3:20:32.560 --> 3:20:34.560]  It was great to be on the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:34.560 --> 3:20:38.560]  And, you know, again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[3:20:38.560 --> 3:20:43.560]  You know, I cover the world with the Trends Journal magazine.
[3:20:43.560 --> 3:20:49.560]  And every day, one of the first sites I go to is InfoWars.
[3:20:49.560 --> 3:20:51.560]  And I go all over the world.
[3:20:51.560 --> 3:20:53.560]  I go to the Global Times of China.
[3:20:53.560 --> 3:20:55.560]  I go to the Japanese Times.
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:21:01.560]  I go to Fars News Agency over there in Iran.
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:04.560]  I go to IRNA, another Iranian.
[3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:09.560]  I go to Jerusalem Post, Times of Israel, Ha Ha That's...
[3:21:09.560 --> 3:21:14.560]  I want to get all the information I can to see what in the world is going on,
[3:21:14.560 --> 3:21:18.560]  what it means, what's next, so that we could give the Trends Journal subscribers
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:23.560]  the information that they need to prepare, prevail, and prosper in these times ahead.
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:27.560]  And InfoWars, as I said, is one of the first sites I go to.
[3:21:27.560 --> 3:21:32.560]  And it's very important to support them.
[3:21:32.560 --> 3:21:42.560]  Because I spend, also, $5 a day to read the Wall Street Journal.
[3:21:42.560 --> 3:21:45.560]  Yep.
[3:21:45.560 --> 3:21:48.560]  $5.
[3:21:48.560 --> 3:21:57.560]  UK celebrates Queen Elizabeth's second seven-decade-on throne.
[3:21:57.560 --> 3:22:00.560]  Wow.
[3:22:00.560 --> 3:22:02.560]  Who cares?
[3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:04.560]  What do I care?
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:06.560]  Seven decades on the throne.
[3:22:06.560 --> 3:22:08.560]  All the nobility.
[3:22:08.560 --> 3:22:10.560]  Oh, we all, we all, we're just vassals.
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:12.560]  We're nobodies.
[3:22:12.560 --> 3:22:14.560]  Do you know this nobility?
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:18.560]  When they sit on the toilet, they don't even have toilets,
[3:22:18.560 --> 3:22:20.560]  because they're way above us.
[3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:22.560]  They know nothing happens to them.
[3:22:22.560 --> 3:22:24.560]  Nope, nope, nope.
[3:22:24.560 --> 3:22:27.560]  Never sneeze, never cough, never do anything.
[3:22:27.560 --> 3:22:29.560]  They are the nobility.
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:32.560]  Why am I hearing this crap?
[3:22:32.560 --> 3:22:36.560]  What the hell are you trying to shove down my throat?
[3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:38.560]  The nobility.
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:40.560]  Oh, yeah, the nobility.
[3:22:40.560 --> 3:22:43.560]  Those wonderful people from the UK.
[3:22:43.560 --> 3:22:45.560]  And you could put an FU in there, too,
[3:22:45.560 --> 3:22:48.560]  and throw a C any place you want.
[3:22:48.560 --> 3:22:51.560]  The sun never sets on the British Empire.
[3:22:51.560 --> 3:22:54.560]  Oh, that nobility chain.
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:57.560]  That wonderful nobility chain.
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:00.560]  Sun never sets on the British Empire.
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:02.560]  We'll go all over the world,
[3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:04.560]  but Selenji, know your voice,
[3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:07.560]  and be proper, like the English.
[3:23:07.560 --> 3:23:09.560]  They always speak so properly,
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:12.560]  as they murder people all over the world.
[3:23:12.560 --> 3:23:15.560]  And you like it over there in India, huh?
[3:23:15.560 --> 3:23:17.560]  How do you know it?
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:20.560]  A couple of hundred years or so.
[3:23:20.560 --> 3:23:23.560]  Oh, yeah, Gandhi over there.
[3:23:23.560 --> 3:23:25.560]  Let's kill him.
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:27.560]  He wants freedom, why?
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:29.560]  How dare he?
[3:23:29.560 --> 3:23:31.560]  How dare he?
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:33.560]  Oh, yeah, that place called Myanmar?
[3:23:33.560 --> 3:23:36.560]  That used to be called Burma?
[3:23:36.560 --> 3:23:43.560]  The murderous, murderous, slimy English.
[3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:46.560]  Hey, an American now could join the club,
[3:23:46.560 --> 3:23:49.560]  because that vein is still going there,
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:23:52.560]  about murdering people all over the world.
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:56.560]  You got that little clown over there.
[3:23:56.560 --> 3:23:59.560]  You got Boris Johnson.
[3:23:59.560 --> 3:24:01.560]  Yeah, Boris Johnson.
[3:24:01.560 --> 3:24:04.560]  That our great artist, Anthony Frieder,
[3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:06.560]  who does those magnificent covers
[3:24:06.560 --> 3:24:08.560]  for the Trends Journal.
[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:10.560]  If I said Anthony, I want you to make me
[3:24:10.560 --> 3:24:13.560]  a picture of the clown
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:16.560]  that's running the UK now, Boris Johnson.
[3:24:16.560 --> 3:24:19.560]  He couldn't come up with a better clown than that.
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:21.560]  And it's real life.
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:26.560]  Oh, and they're sending more weapons over to Russia.
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:27.560]  Yeah.
[3:24:27.560 --> 3:24:31.560]  Oh, oh, and clown, clown Johnson said,
[3:24:31.560 --> 3:24:35.560]  we want you to do everything we can to help you win.
[3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:37.560]  What am I mean?
[3:24:37.560 --> 3:24:41.560]  What am I shoving down his garbage down my throat?
[3:24:41.560 --> 3:24:44.560]  What do I care of the queen?
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:46.560]  There he is, all right?
[3:24:46.560 --> 3:24:48.560]  Boris Johnson.
[3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:52.560]  The clown of a little arrogant jerk
[3:24:52.560 --> 3:24:57.560]  off over there in the UK.
[3:24:57.560 --> 3:25:03.560]  And then you pick up the Wall Street Journal the next day.
[3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:08.560]  Sandberg set exit meta post-info.
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:10.560]  Top story.
[3:25:10.560 --> 3:25:12.560]  Top story.
[3:25:12.560 --> 3:25:13.560]  What do I care?
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:15.560]  What do I care about this?
[3:25:15.560 --> 3:25:16.560]  What do I care?
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:21.560]  Oh, why, Selenchi, calm down and be proper like the English,
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:24.560]  or better yet, be that you're an American.
[3:25:24.560 --> 3:25:28.560]  You could play half American like Barack Obama.
[3:25:28.560 --> 3:25:30.560]  And he was always folks, folks,
[3:25:30.560 --> 3:25:32.560]  poking us all the time.
[3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:35.560]  I want that guy to die for you.
[3:25:35.560 --> 3:25:37.560]  I want that guy to die.
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:39.560]  So be proper like him.
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:41.560]  What do I care about this garbage
[3:25:41.560 --> 3:25:44.560]  that they shoved down our throat?
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:46.560]  It's a garbage can.
[3:25:46.560 --> 3:25:48.560]  It's a garbage can.
[3:25:48.560 --> 3:25:53.560]  The mainstream media is a garbage can.
[3:25:53.560 --> 3:25:55.560]  I got a great buddy.
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:25:57.560]  He's all upset every day.
[3:25:57.560 --> 3:25:59.560]  Well, I watched the news.
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:01.560]  They said this about the news.
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:04.560]  I said, why are you watching this?
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:05.560]  Will you stop it?
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:09.560]  You're an intelligent person.
[3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:14.560]  And it's like going to McDonald's to eat every day.
[3:26:14.560 --> 3:26:20.560]  You want to eat junk food, blow up and blimp out.
[3:26:20.560 --> 3:26:23.560]  Watch junk news.
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:30.560]  Blow your brains out and dumb down.
[3:26:30.560 --> 3:26:34.560]  Can you see what's going on over here?
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:35.560]  Your brain, why?
[3:26:35.560 --> 3:26:36.560]  Here we go.
[3:26:36.560 --> 3:26:41.560]  America, America.
[3:26:41.560 --> 3:26:44.560]  Most obese country in the world.
[3:26:44.560 --> 3:26:47.560]  Again, if I get elected, I want a fat tax.
[3:26:47.560 --> 3:26:49.560]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:51.560]  I don't want to pay for this.
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:26:54.560]  You're driving up all the health care costs.
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:55.560]  How about natural healing?
[3:26:55.560 --> 3:26:57.560]  Have you ever heard Gary know?
[3:26:57.560 --> 3:26:59.560]  How about Mercola?
[3:26:59.560 --> 3:27:00.560]  No, no, no, no.
[3:27:00.560 --> 3:27:01.560]  We got to ban them.
[3:27:01.560 --> 3:27:04.560]  Can't have them around.
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:08.560]  Not a word about natural healing as they saw us the COVID war.
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:13.560]  And again, you get these great products on info wars that can help heal you.
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:20.560]  And this is the time to get in the best shape you can spiritually, emotionally or physically.
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:24.560]  So do what you can with these products because they're there to help you.
[3:27:24.560 --> 3:27:27.560]  One after another.
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:28.560]  Bodies.
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:31.560]  And you know, my favorite.
[3:27:31.560 --> 3:27:33.560]  Super male vitality.
[3:27:33.560 --> 3:27:34.560]  Got to get that.
[3:27:34.560 --> 3:27:37.560]  Got to get that vitality going.
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:41.560]  Because look at the clowns that were on the show.
[3:27:41.560 --> 3:27:44.560]  Drop a boogie, not an ounce of jive.
[3:27:44.560 --> 3:27:47.560]  Tight cats and tight kittens.
[3:27:47.560 --> 3:27:52.560]  So you got these great, great products and they got a info wars stores.
[3:27:52.560 --> 3:27:59.560]  Super summer sale that you don't want to miss 40% off 50% off one deal after another.
[3:27:59.560 --> 3:28:03.560]  This is the time to get in shape the best way you can.
[3:28:03.560 --> 3:28:09.560]  By the way, you know, when I went on the air before I got here, rather, I looked at the markets.
[3:28:09.560 --> 3:28:12.560]  The doubt was down.
[3:28:12.560 --> 3:28:15.560]  This morning was up 300 points.
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:17.560]  Where's it going?
[3:28:17.560 --> 3:28:18.560]  What's next?
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:19.560]  What to do?
[3:28:19.560 --> 3:28:20.560]  We come back.
[3:28:20.560 --> 3:28:23.560]  We're going to talk a lot about that.
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:25.560]  There's a lot going on.
[3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:30.560]  Never in my life have I seen anything like this.
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:35.560]  I'm very sad about the state of what's happened to this country.
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:40.560]  From ragtime to swing.
[3:28:40.560 --> 3:28:41.560]  To rock and roll.
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:45.560]  R&B.
[3:28:45.560 --> 3:28:47.560]  To Motown.
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:49.560]  And now it's no town.
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:52.560]  One bad rap with one bad attitude.
[3:28:52.560 --> 3:28:55.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:29:22.560 --> 3:29:23.560]  I love it.
[3:29:23.560 --> 3:29:24.560]  It's 2495.
[3:29:24.560 --> 3:29:25.560]  Alex Jones is right on the front.
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:26.560]  The Red Thunderbolt.
[3:29:26.560 --> 3:29:30.560]  And then again, on the back, a big bold info wars dot com.
[3:29:30.560 --> 3:29:31.560]  Exercise your first amendment.
[3:29:31.560 --> 3:29:37.560]  Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully silence you and fund the info war at the same time.
[3:29:37.560 --> 3:29:47.560]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom resistance to the new world order than the Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available at info wars store dot com.
[3:29:47.560 --> 3:29:50.560]  And again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[3:29:50.560 --> 3:29:54.560]  We're doing one more run and then no more info wars store dot com.
[3:29:54.560 --> 3:29:56.560]  Get yours today.
[3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:02.560]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones needs to support info wars and band dot video.
[3:30:02.560 --> 3:30:05.560]  You know, the Bible says let another mouth praise you.
[3:30:05.560 --> 3:30:06.560]  I'm going to do that right now.
[3:30:06.560 --> 3:30:10.560]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[3:30:10.560 --> 3:30:15.560]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[3:30:15.560 --> 3:30:21.560]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself.
[3:30:21.560 --> 3:30:25.560]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform.
[3:30:25.560 --> 3:30:30.560]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[3:30:30.560 --> 3:30:36.560]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcast with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL.
[3:30:36.560 --> 3:30:44.560]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and band dot video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[3:30:44.560 --> 3:30:47.560]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[3:30:47.560 --> 3:30:48.560]  So go check out the store.
[3:30:48.560 --> 3:30:49.560]  Go support their store.

[3:30:52.560 --> 3:30:54.560]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[3:30:56.560 --> 3:31:00.560]  Introducing the newest product from info wars life dot com.
[3:31:00.560 --> 3:31:04.560]  We are so proud of info wars life immune support.

[3:31:18.560 --> 3:31:19.560]  So that's a 360 win.
[3:31:19.560 --> 3:31:22.560]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[3:31:22.560 --> 3:31:31.560]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root, loatium root and more.
[3:31:31.560 --> 3:31:33.560]  This product is incredible.
[3:31:33.560 --> 3:31:40.560]  Info wars immune support exclusively available at info wars store dot com is funding the tip of the spear, the info wars operation.
[3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:42.560]  It is a 360 win.
[3:31:42.560 --> 3:31:49.560]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[3:31:49.560 --> 3:31:51.560]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[3:31:51.560 --> 3:31:54.560]  Take action now info wars store dot com.
[3:31:56.560 --> 3:32:01.560]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right.
[3:32:01.560 --> 3:32:03.560]  People ask what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:07.560]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[3:32:07.560 --> 3:32:08.560]  I tried to stop it.
[3:32:08.560 --> 3:32:19.560]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[3:32:19.560 --> 3:32:21.560]  It's now out in the open.
[3:32:21.560 --> 3:32:27.560]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos group.
[3:32:27.560 --> 3:32:30.560]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[3:32:30.560 --> 3:32:33.560]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[3:32:33.560 --> 3:32:34.560]  We're going to win this thing.
[3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:36.560]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:44.560]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[3:32:44.560 --> 3:32:50.560]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:32:50.560 --> 3:33:07.560]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[3:33:21.560 --> 3:33:27.560]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:33:27.560 --> 3:33:29.560]  Hey, great to be in on the Alex Jones show.
[3:33:29.560 --> 3:33:36.560]  And as that cover of the Trends Journal shows, ignorance is bliss, knowledge is power.
[3:33:36.560 --> 3:33:45.560]  I just was talking about, you know, these covers about the queen's holiday over here, you know.
[3:33:45.560 --> 3:33:48.560]  One newspaper after another, all the news.
[3:33:48.560 --> 3:33:53.560]  This is from the Jerusalem Post on June 4th.
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:34:03.560]  Whether or not you're in the UK, an expatriate Brit or just someone who loved the crown, they have the crown in italics, the crown.
[3:34:03.560 --> 3:34:11.560]  Oh, yeah, dressed up in these Halloween costumes and all these guys with all these little metals on them.
[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:21.560]  Oh, how nice it is they got these metals. Well, I bent over and got that metal and I kneeled down and got that metal and I bent.
[3:34:21.560 --> 3:34:25.560]  What are you doing with this?
[3:34:25.560 --> 3:34:30.560]  It's a Halloween costume. What am I six years old?
[3:34:30.560 --> 3:34:34.560]  Oh, no, Salente, they are the royalty.
[3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:40.560]  You are just a surf, a worker in a global plantation of slave landia.
[3:34:40.560 --> 3:34:43.560]  Yes.
[3:34:43.560 --> 3:34:47.560]  We love the crown. It's clear. You ready?
[3:34:47.560 --> 3:34:52.560]  That the world can't get enough of the royal family.
[3:34:52.560 --> 3:34:56.560]  Whether it's the wedding of Kate Middleton to Prince William.
[3:34:56.560 --> 3:34:59.560]  Yeah, Prince. Yeah, boy. Yeah, boy.
[3:34:59.560 --> 3:35:02.560]  Prince, I got to pick it up and put it on a plastic bag.
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:05.560]  Oh, oh, I forgot the prince doesn't do that.
[3:35:05.560 --> 3:35:08.560]  Look at these costumes that they wear.
[3:35:08.560 --> 3:35:11.560]  You're loyal. Look at this crap.
[3:35:11.560 --> 3:35:17.560]  How can anybody with a brain bigger than a pea swallowed his garbage?
[3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:20.560]  Look at them. Look at them.
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:23.560]  And they send people to go get killed.
[3:35:23.560 --> 3:35:27.560]  Look at them. Hollywood.
[3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:30.560]  Hey, little costumes.
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:34.560]  Anyway.
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:38.560]  Yep.
[3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:42.560]  It's larger than life aura that seemed to surround the monarchy,
[3:35:42.560 --> 3:35:49.560]  which, no matter how tarnished, still shines brightly.
[3:35:49.560 --> 3:35:52.560]  Like, God, but you paid me to write this crap.
[3:35:52.560 --> 3:35:54.560]  Here's what the story is about.
[3:35:54.560 --> 3:35:57.560]  There he is. Hey, Prince. Yeah, boy.
[3:35:57.560 --> 3:36:02.560]  Yeah, boy. Hey, how'd you get that gold, uh, that gold little thing there?
[3:36:02.560 --> 3:36:06.560]  What's that thing with the barring with those two things hanging down
[3:36:06.560 --> 3:36:10.560]  and that little look emblem you got down there? Huh?
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:14.560]  Yo, I love that red with the blue stripe.
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:16.560]  Oh, how elegant.
[3:36:16.560 --> 3:36:21.560]  Hey, Halloween costume. Look at this guy. Look at this.
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:26.560]  Here's what they do to you. Get this in your head, everybody.
[3:36:26.560 --> 3:36:29.560]  We're nothing but peons.
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:32.560]  The authorities are in charge.
[3:36:32.560 --> 3:36:37.560]  You've got California Gavin, witness Gavin Newsom over there.
[3:36:37.560 --> 3:36:41.560]  Another arrogant daddy's boy telling you what to do.
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:44.560]  It's one country after another.
[3:36:44.560 --> 3:36:46.560]  One state after another.
[3:36:46.560 --> 3:36:50.560]  They do this so you are nothing.
[3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:53.560]  You're presidents. You're prime ministers.
[3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:56.560]  Hey, roll out the red carpet.
[3:36:56.560 --> 3:37:00.560]  I won't work. Walk on regular ground.
[3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:05.560]  How dare you? I want that red carpet.
[3:37:05.560 --> 3:37:07.560]  Red carpet.
[3:37:07.560 --> 3:37:11.560]  They get the red carpet treatment as they steal our money.
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:15.560]  These clowns never work a day in their lives,
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:18.560]  just like your senators and congressmen,
[3:37:18.560 --> 3:37:22.560]  just like your state senators and mayors.
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:28.560]  This is the authoritarian message to putting your brain,
[3:37:28.560 --> 3:37:33.560]  to brainwash you because you're nothing.
[3:37:33.560 --> 3:37:35.560]  You're not nobility.
[3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:40.560]  Well, I was born in the Bronx.
[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:46.560]  I'm just a nobody.
[3:37:46.560 --> 3:37:50.560]  It's brainwashing.
[3:37:50.560 --> 3:37:56.560]  It's brainwashing to the fullest extent.
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:37:58.560]  Leaving humanity.
[3:37:58.560 --> 3:38:03.560]  Great book by Joe Durand, one of our writers.
[3:38:03.560 --> 3:38:05.560]  It's all part of it.
[3:38:05.560 --> 3:38:08.560]  It's been going on forever.
[3:38:08.560 --> 3:38:11.560]  It's a freak show.
[3:38:11.560 --> 3:38:15.560]  Anyway, enough of the freaks.
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:18.560]  Speaking of which,
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:22.560]  Biden makes fervent plea to strict the gun lords.
[3:38:22.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  How much more carnage are we willing to accept?
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:28.560]  Oh, how much more carnage?
[3:38:28.560 --> 3:38:30.560]  Hey, that little boy blinking.
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:32.560]  Another day's boy.
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:34.560]  Oh, he's in the royalty club.
[3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:36.560]  Oh, the little blinkers in the royalty.
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:37.560]  I went to Dalton.
[3:38:37.560 --> 3:38:38.560]  I went to Harvard.
[3:38:38.560 --> 3:38:40.560]  My daddy.
[3:38:40.560 --> 3:38:41.560]  My daddy.
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:46.560]  Oh, my daddy.
[3:38:46.560 --> 3:38:48.560]  Carnage.
[3:38:48.560 --> 3:38:51.560]  Look at all the weapons you're sending over there.
[3:38:51.560 --> 3:38:55.560]  Look at all the weapons.
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  Mass murder.
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:00.560]  What are you talking about?
[3:39:00.560 --> 3:39:02.560]  Gun control?
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:03.560]  What are you going to control?
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:05.560]  Anybody who wants to get a gun could get a gun.
[3:39:05.560 --> 3:39:09.560]  Just like you lowlife pieces of garbage.
[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:11.560]  You put all those, oh, three strikes you're out.
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:12.560]  Oh, you remember that one, Biden?
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:14.560]  Hey, man, smoking a joint.
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:15.560]  Lock them up.
[3:39:15.560 --> 3:39:17.560]  Three strikes you're out.
[3:39:17.560 --> 3:39:19.560]  Oh, but now we're going to legalize it
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:21.560]  because we're a bunch of morons
[3:39:21.560 --> 3:39:24.560]  and only one stupid guy did it back in the 1930s.
[3:39:24.560 --> 3:39:27.560]  But if we legalize it, we legalize nature.
[3:39:27.560 --> 3:39:30.560]  We legalize nature because we're the authorities.
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:32.560]  We can do anything we want.
[3:39:32.560 --> 3:39:35.560]  We can get a lot of tax money.
[3:39:35.560 --> 3:39:37.560]  I get all the part I ever wanted in my life,
[3:39:37.560 --> 3:39:43.560]  legally legal, when I used to.
[3:39:43.560 --> 3:39:46.560]  Same thing with guns.
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:48.560]  You want to get one, you can get one.
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:53.560]  All this is going to do is rob us of our rights.
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  Yeah.
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:59.560]  Seeking clues why gunmen are so young.
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:05.560]  Most recent suspects were under 21 years of age.
[3:40:05.560 --> 3:40:12.560]  And last year, overdoses reached the highest level.
[3:40:12.560 --> 3:40:13.560]  It's one after another.
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:16.560]  These kids are mentally ill.
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:19.560]  And it's part of society.
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:24.560]  Again, you look at this country you used to look like.
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:26.560]  Now it looks like crap.
[3:40:26.560 --> 3:40:27.560]  Look at the way people dress.
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:30.560]  Look what they look like.
[3:40:30.560 --> 3:40:32.560]  Oh, you don't need your mother to raise you.
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:35.560]  Put the kid in a set of memo for the stranger
[3:40:35.560 --> 3:40:38.560]  after three weeks in daycare.
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:45.560]  It'll all, that'll be fine. It'll be just like your mother.
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:40:48.560]  Oh, give them, I ran away from kindergarten
[3:40:48.560 --> 3:40:49.560]  at four and a half years old.
[3:40:49.560 --> 3:40:52.560]  Of course, the Boston Post drove in the Bronx.
[3:40:52.560 --> 3:40:53.560]  They took me out of school.
[3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:55.560]  Now they have me all shot up with drugs.
[3:40:55.560 --> 3:40:59.560]  How many of these kids were on antidepressants?
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  Look at their family background.
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:04.560]  What are you talking about gun control?
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:06.560]  I want gun control.
[3:41:06.560 --> 3:41:08.560]  Gun control, yep.
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:11.560]  Gun control, not one military weapon
[3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:14.560]  brought outside the United States.
[3:41:14.560 --> 3:41:17.560]  Every military weapon only in the United States.
[3:41:17.560 --> 3:41:19.560]  I launched Occupied Peace.
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:20.560]  No foreign entanglements.
[3:41:20.560 --> 3:41:22.560]  Bring home the troops.
[3:41:22.560 --> 3:41:24.560]  Close down the borders and secure them with the troops.
[3:41:24.560 --> 3:41:28.560]  Put them to work.
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:31.560]  Rebuilding our rotted infrastructure.
[3:41:31.560 --> 3:41:33.560]  If you want to, we'll let the people vote.
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:37.560]  And by the way, yep.
[3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:40.560]  On July 23rd.
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:44.560]  July 23rd put Sunday calendar.
[3:41:44.560 --> 3:41:49.560]  I'm having a freedom festival up here in Kingston.
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:51.560]  On the four corners of freedom.
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  The only place in the United States
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:55.560]  with pre-revolutionary war stone buildings
[3:41:55.560 --> 3:41:58.560]  on each corner and I own three of them.
[3:41:58.560 --> 3:42:03.560]  We have a huge garden beyond the Franz Roggenhaus,
[3:42:03.560 --> 3:42:06.560]  the 1750s, Franz Roggenhaus.
[3:42:06.560 --> 3:42:10.560]  And Judge Napolitano is going to be one of the speakers.
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:14.560]  And I'm bringing in some hot, happy music
[3:42:14.560 --> 3:42:19.560]  to get you feeling good, to lift the spirit,
[3:42:19.560 --> 3:42:21.560]  to put back some of the joy and beauty
[3:42:21.560 --> 3:42:24.560]  that they sucked out of our lives.
[3:42:24.560 --> 3:42:27.560]  These little people, these little clowns,
[3:42:27.560 --> 3:42:28.560]  they're my favorite.
[3:42:28.560 --> 3:42:30.560]  Oh, I hate the Democrats.
[3:42:30.560 --> 3:42:31.560]  I love the Republicans.
[3:42:31.560 --> 3:42:33.560]  Oh, I love Lindsey Graham.
[3:42:33.560 --> 3:42:35.560]  Now there's a guy for you, maybe, yes.
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:37.560]  Oh, no, Mitch McConnell.
[3:42:37.560 --> 3:42:40.560]  I'm a Democrat. Nancy Pelosi's for me.
[3:42:40.560 --> 3:42:41.560]  No, no, no, no.
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:42:42.560]  Diane, not so fine.
[3:42:42.560 --> 3:42:44.560]  Signed little Chuck E. Schumer.
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:46.560]  This is a rally for freedom.
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:48.560]  It's a festival.
[3:42:48.560 --> 3:42:50.560]  Put it on your calendar.
[3:42:50.560 --> 3:42:51.560]  July 23rd.
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:54.560]  Four corners of freedom in Kingston.
[3:42:54.560 --> 3:42:56.560]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:56.560 --> 3:43:00.560]  The biggest sale of the historic year, 2022, is here.

[3:43:56.560 --> 3:43:58.560]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[3:43:58.560 --> 3:44:00.560]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:01.560]  Welcome.
[3:44:01.560 --> 3:44:02.560]  Hello, Alex.
[3:44:02.560 --> 3:44:03.560]  Yes, Malcolm.
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:07.560]  where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:09.560]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[3:44:09.560 --> 3:44:11.560]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:14.560]  Supermail volatility and Brain Force Plus.
[3:44:14.560 --> 3:44:15.560]  Mix those two together.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:17.560]  Unstoppable tank.
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:19.560]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:21.560]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[3:44:21.560 --> 3:44:23.560]  that have never been heated up.
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:27.560]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[3:44:27.560 --> 3:44:30.560]  They also work quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:32.560]  This is like a very fine wine.
[3:44:32.560 --> 3:44:34.560]  In fact, each batch is different.
[3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:36.560]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just OK.
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:38.560]  People are like, why are you selling something
[3:44:38.560 --> 3:44:40.560]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[3:44:40.560 --> 3:44:41.560]  That's just how it is.
[3:44:41.560 --> 3:44:42.560]  It's how it works.
[3:44:42.560 --> 3:44:44.560]  So it's always good.
[3:44:44.560 --> 3:44:46.560]  Sometimes it's like super strong.
[3:44:46.560 --> 3:44:49.560]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[3:44:49.560 --> 3:44:50.560]  then this is it.
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:44:59.560]  The internet and talk radio are on fire
[3:44:59.560 --> 3:45:01.560]  with the slogan, Alex Jones is right.
[3:45:01.560 --> 3:45:03.560]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[3:45:03.560 --> 3:45:05.560]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling
[3:45:05.560 --> 3:45:07.560]  because I knew this was coming.
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:09.560]  I tried to stop it.
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:11.560]  And now everything I've talked about
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:13.560]  is going to become more important than ever.
[3:45:13.560 --> 3:45:16.560]  Because the globalists aren't hiding anymore
[3:45:16.560 --> 3:45:19.560]  in policy reports and documents.
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:21.560]  It's now out in the open.
[3:45:21.560 --> 3:45:24.560]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the Earth.
[3:45:24.560 --> 3:45:27.560]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Script.
[3:45:27.560 --> 3:45:30.560]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[3:45:30.560 --> 3:45:32.560]  They're making their move because they know
[3:45:32.560 --> 3:45:33.560]  they're behind schedule.
[3:45:33.560 --> 3:45:34.560]  We're going to win this thing.
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:36.560]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:38.560]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:40.560]  for your word of mouth and your prayer
[3:45:40.560 --> 3:45:41.560]  and your financial support.
[3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:44.560]  Because without you, Info Wars would not be here.
[3:45:44.560 --> 3:45:46.560]  I want you to really internalize the fact
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:47.560]  that you are the Info War.
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:50.560]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:52.560]  So I want to thank you and salute you again
[3:45:52.560 --> 3:45:54.560]  for all you've done and ask you now
[3:45:54.560 --> 3:45:56.560]  to redouble your efforts.
[3:45:56.560 --> 3:45:57.560]  You see this?
[3:45:57.560 --> 3:46:00.560]  It's an Info Wars Republic Defense Card
[3:46:00.560 --> 3:46:03.560]  with original Info Wars art designed by yours truly
[3:46:03.560 --> 3:46:05.560]  with a little gold bar implanted in it.
[3:46:05.560 --> 3:46:07.560]  And on the back, it's got a hologram.
[3:46:07.560 --> 3:46:10.560]  There are only 25,000 of these in existence
[3:46:10.560 --> 3:46:12.560]  and they'll never be made again.
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:14.560]  The bank that owns the mint that has started
[3:46:14.560 --> 3:46:16.560]  putting these out the last few years
[3:46:16.560 --> 3:46:20.560]  just sold out of 300,000 of a similar offering
[3:46:20.560 --> 3:46:22.560]  that was 40% more than what we're selling these for.
[3:46:22.560 --> 3:46:23.560]  And when you get three or more,
[3:46:23.560 --> 3:46:25.560]  you can get these at 50% off
[3:46:25.560 --> 3:46:27.560]  and they fund the Info War.

[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:26.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order,
[3:47:26.560 --> 3:47:35.560]  it's Alex Jones and now your host, Gerald Salente.
[3:47:35.560 --> 3:47:37.560]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:37.560 --> 3:47:39.560]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars,
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:43.560]  keep the truth alive because they're robbing it from us.
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:45.560]  It's a freak show.
[3:47:45.560 --> 3:47:46.560]  It's a freak show.
[3:47:46.560 --> 3:47:48.560]  What's your favorite freak show?
[3:47:48.560 --> 3:47:49.560]  Cartoon News Network.
[3:47:49.560 --> 3:47:51.560]  Oh, no, that's CNN.
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:52.560]  Yeah.
[3:47:52.560 --> 3:47:55.560]  Anyway, going back to the markets.
[3:47:55.560 --> 3:47:58.560]  I mean, they're flat now up a little bit.
[3:47:58.560 --> 3:48:01.560]  Last week, the U.S. Treasury Secretary,
[3:48:01.560 --> 3:48:04.560]  Janet Yellen,
[3:48:04.560 --> 3:48:07.560]  Ms. Fatah Brute,
[3:48:07.560 --> 3:48:09.560]  said, quote,
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:12.560]  again, we wrote about this in the Trends Journal
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:15.560]  for months over a year.
[3:48:15.560 --> 3:48:18.560]  Back in April of last year,
[3:48:18.560 --> 3:48:21.560]  we said that inflation would only go up about 3%.
[3:48:21.560 --> 3:48:23.560]  And that was temporary.
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:26.560]  And then it became transitory.
[3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:28.560]  And then it became transgender-tory
[3:48:28.560 --> 3:48:30.560]  because we have to be proper.
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:31.560]  There she is.
[3:48:31.560 --> 3:48:33.560]  Not only me.
[3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:34.560]  We're with the same age.
[3:48:34.560 --> 3:48:37.560]  I hope I don't look as bad as her.
[3:48:37.560 --> 3:48:39.560]  Oh, but she's the Treasury Secretary.
[3:48:39.560 --> 3:48:42.560]  If only a woman was in charge.
[3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:43.560]  Yeah.
[3:48:43.560 --> 3:48:46.560]  As I say, men, women, black, white, green, yellow,
[3:48:46.560 --> 3:48:49.560]  happy, mad, beloved man.
[3:48:49.560 --> 3:48:52.560]  Race, creed, color, good and bad comes in all of them.
[3:48:52.560 --> 3:48:54.560]  She went.
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:48:57.560]  She was talking to mouse Blitzer on CNN.
[3:48:57.560 --> 3:48:58.560]  A wolf.
[3:48:58.560 --> 3:49:02.560]  Here, boy, here, boy, here, boy.
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:03.560]  Wolf.
[3:49:03.560 --> 3:49:04.560]  What a wolf.
[3:49:04.560 --> 3:49:06.560]  To my owner, me, uh,
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:08.560]  Ms. Fatah Brute.
[3:49:08.560 --> 3:49:10.560]  Any way, she said,
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.560]  I think I was wrong then about the path
[3:49:13.560 --> 3:49:19.640]  Hey, gutsome, what do you mean you think you were wrong?
[3:49:19.640 --> 3:49:21.360]  How about you were wrong?
[3:49:21.360 --> 3:49:23.320]  Why, how dare you say that?
[3:49:23.320 --> 3:49:30.520]  I'm the Treasury Secretary and before that I was the head of the Federal Reserve.
[3:49:30.520 --> 3:49:34.440]  Yeah, the banksters, the banksters.
[3:49:34.440 --> 3:49:41.040]  All right, you got the head bankster now, our head of our Treasury Secretary.
[3:49:41.040 --> 3:49:43.080]  Who's running the government?
[3:49:43.080 --> 3:49:45.080]  Grow up.
[3:49:45.080 --> 3:49:46.800]  Grow up.
[3:49:46.800 --> 3:49:49.000]  The banksters are in charge.
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:54.860]  Yeah, the ones that put Jesus Christ up on the cross, three days later after he drove
[3:49:54.860 --> 3:49:56.640]  him out of the temple.
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:02.560]  Hey, Jamie Dimon, was your great, great, great, great, great grandfather there?
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:05.320]  Look at him.
[3:50:05.320 --> 3:50:08.480]  Our Treasury Secretary, I think I was wrong.
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:11.920]  We said in the Trends Journal, inflation is real.
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:20.000]  look into oil now, $120 of barrel for Brent crude, and it's gonna go higher. It's gonna
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:26.160]  go higher because things are breaking out in the Middle East between Israel and Iran.
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:31.400]  Israeli president is having trouble staying in power said he may has the right to stop
[3:50:31.400 --> 3:50:38.280]  Iran's nuclear development as we have about a couple of hundred nuclear weapons, but they
[3:50:38.280 --> 3:50:51.440]  can have any. We the banksters are in control. They're rigging the markets. They got the they
[3:50:51.440 --> 3:50:57.000]  got the plunge protection team in there. There's no reality to it. And if you want to know more
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  about it, go to Gerald Salente, CEO and TV or Trends Journal on YouTube and look at the
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:12.880]  latest interview I did with Gregory Manorino. Yeah, get ready for a massive market crash.
[3:51:12.880 --> 3:51:27.720]  Yeah. And we're doing everything we can to help you prepare for it. Again, it's the masses are
[3:51:27.720 --> 3:51:37.640]  delusional. Knowledge is power. And again, you're getting that from going in four words, the people
[3:51:37.640 --> 3:51:46.480]  they have on, I felt that I had on talk about taxes and again, the federal defense, the guy may
[3:51:46.480 --> 3:51:54.240]  rotten hell Woodrow Wilson, sending us into World War One that we had no business being in, then
[3:51:54.240 --> 3:52:04.320]  giving us the Federal Reserve and income tax. We have income tax law 1913 1914 was a 1% out of 20%.
[3:52:04.320 --> 3:52:15.920]  All right. All right, it's a gangster gang. Woodrow Wilson, Woodrow rotten hell. Speaking of
[3:52:15.920 --> 3:52:25.200]  which, Zelensky, the comedian who played a comedian on TV and became the comedian president of Ukraine
[3:52:25.200 --> 3:52:33.520]  said that Ukraine is beginning to push for a quote peace, but with benefits for Russia. This is
[3:52:33.520 --> 3:52:38.240]  out just now. Zelensky said that Western politicians in the media beginning to push Ukraine
[3:52:38.240 --> 3:52:48.040]  down the wall. Oh, UK will give Ukraine market system. That's another one. Ukraine's this is on
[3:52:48.040 --> 3:52:59.600]  this is on Friday. Ukraine's Zelensky vows on 100th day of Russian invasion that victory will be ours.
[3:52:59.600 --> 3:53:13.240]  Want to bet? How much you want to bet? UK and Zelensky said that you will do what he has to do
[3:53:13.240 --> 3:53:22.400]  that the West has sent even more potent weapons to Ukraine and piled on even more stringent
[3:53:22.400 --> 3:53:29.560]  sanctions with the European Union also on Friday, formally adopting a ban on most Russian oil and
[3:53:29.560 --> 3:53:41.000]  ports. And who is it hurting? We the little people of slave land. Yeah. Yep. One after another.
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:51.160]  Yeah. Then US cyber chief admits to attacks against Russia in Ukraine. This is last Wednesday in
[3:53:51.160 --> 3:54:00.880]  the sky news. This guy, NASA director general Paul Nakasone said we've conducted a series of
[3:54:00.880 --> 3:54:11.680]  operations across the full spectrum, offensive, defensive and information operations that the
[3:54:11.680 --> 3:54:19.200]  US is conducting offensive hacking operations in support of Ukraine. United States is a war.
[3:54:19.200 --> 3:54:28.560]  And it's a losing war. I said from the very beginning that Ukraine would lose this war.
[3:54:28.560 --> 3:54:40.360]  You've heard me say many times if Napoleon couldn't pull it off is March to Moscow in 1812 with
[3:54:40.360 --> 3:54:50.520]  420,000 poor guys that believed as garbage. 420,000 left Poland to attack Moscow came back with
[3:54:50.520 --> 3:55:02.440]  10,000. Adolf Hitler, Operation Barbarossa killed 25 million Russians. Russians were the first to
[3:55:02.440 --> 3:55:13.680]  defeat the Germans before the Americans. And now you're hearing. Ukraine won't be able to win
[3:55:13.680 --> 3:55:21.760]  against Russia and the US must persuade Kev to negotiate with Moscow to end conflict. You
[3:55:21.760 --> 3:55:29.800]  DeSantis who oversaw NATO and arms control policy during the Reagan administration has insisted.
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:40.360]  Exactly what I had said from the beginning. And again, one of our transjournal covers before
[3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:47.240]  it happened, when it happened, negotiate for peace arrest in peace. They're going to have to
[3:55:47.240 --> 3:55:55.480]  negotiate for peace. It would have been better to negotiate before peace before the war started.
[3:55:55.480 --> 3:56:04.960]  Let's make a deal. And now you're losing. What's going on in Ukraine is none of my business.
[3:56:04.960 --> 3:56:14.640]  Again, wrote about it in detail in the transjournal back in 2014, when the United States over through
[3:56:14.640 --> 3:56:21.920]  the democratically elected government of the Yanukovych. I'm an American. My country is a thing.
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:29.800]  No more sweet land or liberty. And I can't sing because I just got to have a bad rap.
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:41.680]  I'm fighting for freedom. I'm anti authoritarian. I'm anti nobility. You could shove your nobility
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:48.880]  up. You know what? Don't you tell me you're noble and you're better than me. Hey, all men
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:57.720]  are created equally. Oh, and women. And all things are connected like the blood which unites
[3:56:57.720 --> 3:57:08.760]  us all to achieve Seattle. There you go. There's the cover. We are in the fight for our lives.
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:17.760]  Let freedom ring. You have no idea how really heartbroken I am about what's going on. I'm
[3:57:17.760 --> 3:57:24.640]  a visionary and I see the future and I watch this country collapse in front of me. Elegant
[3:57:24.640 --> 3:57:46.040]  style grace. Again, the red time to swing the rock and roll to R&D to Motown to no town.

[3:58:46.360 --> 3:58:53.280]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class. Not
[3:58:53.280 --> 3:58:59.680]  in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there a real
[3:58:59.680 --> 3:59:05.520]  study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central banks that
[3:59:05.520 --> 3:59:11.240]  basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look in to say
[3:59:11.240 --> 3:59:15.560]  the Anglo-American establishment that founded the Bilderberg group, the trilateral commission
[3:59:15.560 --> 3:59:20.320]  of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers. Until
[3:59:20.320 --> 3:59:25.360]  10 years ago the media said the control corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't exist.
[3:59:25.360 --> 3:59:30.320]  Well now the Bilderberg group is public, it's former head, still on the steering committee,
[3:59:30.320 --> 3:59:36.400]  it's called Schwab and he has set up the great reset in global government and as a liberty
[3:59:36.400 --> 3:59:41.040]  movement worldwide we don't address the globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide
[3:59:41.040 --> 3:59:44.880]  authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. When you expose them we can beat
[3:59:44.880 --> 3:59:53.200]  them easily.
