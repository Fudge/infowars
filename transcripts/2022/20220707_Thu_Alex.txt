[00:00.000 --> 00:28.280]  Why do the Supreme Court do the right thing and overturn Roe v. Wade just under the Constitution
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.880]  to kick him back to the States?
[00:29.880 --> 00:34.440]  One of the reasons why this issue is so hotly contested in the United States is that it
[00:34.440 --> 00:39.160]  wasn't decided by the people through the democratic process of the legislatures.
[00:39.160 --> 00:40.160]  And now it will be.
[00:40.160 --> 00:44.720]  And it will go to the states where those states will be able to reflect the will and the views
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.040]  of the people who live there.
[00:46.040 --> 00:48.120]  Well, a lot of reasons.
[00:48.120 --> 00:56.680]  But the big one is that we have 3D modeling and 3D scans in HD for now 20 plus years of
[00:56.680 --> 01:03.880]  babies in the womb, sucking their thumbs in even 2-3 months, playing, dancing, and we
[01:03.880 --> 01:05.360]  know that's a human.
[01:05.360 --> 01:11.720]  And then you've got the pro-abortion crowd saying it's a satanic sacrament in court,
[01:11.720 --> 01:15.320]  saying we're going to kill those little bastards wearing shirts celebrating, yeah, I killed
[01:15.320 --> 01:16.800]  my baby, I'm going to kill more.
[01:16.800 --> 01:18.320]  Yeah, I would murder them.
[01:18.320 --> 01:23.320]  I'll slit their throat if I have to.
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.240]  And really showing us how sick and evil they are in their cult of death.
[01:27.240 --> 01:32.720]  Now, it's not a total overturn of Roe v. Wade saying that it's illegal.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.800]  Well, states can't announce slavery's legal again.
[01:35.800 --> 01:41.160]  The statement has been made that the government has a right to come in your home and tell
[01:41.160 --> 01:45.560]  you as a woman and as a family what you should do with your body.
[01:45.560 --> 01:49.240]  This is not about freedom or personal choice.
[01:49.240 --> 01:50.400]  Get vaccinated.
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.920]  We also know that we've had a history in this country of government trying to claim ownership
[01:55.920 --> 01:57.840]  over human bodies.
[01:57.840 --> 01:58.840]  Exactly.
[01:58.840 --> 02:00.720]  States can't announce they can take your guns.
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.000]  States can't announce any of that in our republic system.
[02:04.000 --> 02:08.600]  It was the left celebration of killing babies up to their due date.
[02:08.600 --> 02:15.040]  And then multiple states like New York passing laws you could kill babies for weeks after
[02:15.040 --> 02:16.040]  birth.
[02:16.040 --> 02:21.680]  I'm talking about your bill, how late in the third trimester could a physician perform
[02:21.680 --> 02:26.040]  an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?
[02:26.040 --> 02:30.040]  So I mean, through the third trimester, the third trimester goes all the way up to 40
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.040]  weeks.
[02:31.040 --> 02:32.040]  Okay.
[02:32.040 --> 02:33.040]  But to the end of the third trimester?
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.040]  Yep.
[02:34.040 --> 02:35.040]  I don't think we have a limit in the bill.
[02:35.040 --> 02:37.280]  Where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth.
[02:37.280 --> 02:41.400]  She has physical signs that she's about to give a birth.
[02:41.400 --> 02:45.640]  Would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?
[02:45.640 --> 02:52.480]  Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the doctor, the physician, and
[02:52.480 --> 02:53.480]  the woman would make at that point.
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.480]  I understand that.
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.480]  I'm asking if your bill allows that.
[02:55.480 --> 02:57.400]  My bill would allow that, yes.
[02:57.400 --> 03:00.920]  And people were like, what the hell is this?
[03:00.920 --> 03:06.560]  And finally started waking up out of their comas.
[03:06.560 --> 03:13.240]  I am Dr. Bernard N. Nacanson, formerly the director of the largest abortion clinic in
[03:13.240 --> 03:22.320]  the Western world, and I am the last surviving founding member of NARAL, the pro-abortion
[03:22.320 --> 03:30.160]  organization which brought legal abortion to the entire United States.
[03:30.160 --> 03:36.360]  I am personally responsible for over 75,000 abortions.
[03:36.360 --> 03:46.040]  We founded NARAL in the late 1960s with our purpose to export our pro-abortion mentality
[03:46.040 --> 03:47.040]  everywhere.
[03:47.040 --> 03:55.280]  To achieve that end, we adopted the strategy to deny what we knew to be true, that abortion
[03:55.280 --> 04:00.200]  kills an existing living human being.
[04:00.200 --> 04:07.440]  We denied that fact in an effort to mislead the American public and the courts of this
[04:07.440 --> 04:08.440]  land.
[04:08.440 --> 04:14.440]  This was the greatest mistake of my life, and legal abortion was the greatest mistake
[04:14.440 --> 04:17.400]  this nation has ever conceived.
[04:17.400 --> 04:22.400]  This shows in this sea of evil and corruption and collapsing borders and devalued currencies
[04:22.400 --> 04:28.800]  and pedophilia and world government attacks on the family and all of it, that humanity
[04:28.800 --> 04:56.880]  is coming back.

[06:11.200 --> 06:16.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[06:16.040 --> 06:17.800]  You want to stop tyranny?
[06:17.800 --> 06:24.520]  Well so does he, live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:24.520 --> 06:30.640]  It is Thursday, July 7th, 2022, I'm your host Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled
[06:30.640 --> 06:33.920]  Central Texas Studios in Austin, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:33.920 --> 06:39.080]  Alright, I really love taking phone calls, so we're going to take phone calls throughout
[06:39.080 --> 06:42.720]  the broadcast today, starting at the bottom of the hour, and I'm going to give the number
[06:42.720 --> 06:46.800]  out and we'll take calls right through the entire transmission.
[06:46.800 --> 06:51.960]  On any subject or anything you'd like to bring up or discuss, it is a live Thursday broadcast.
[06:51.960 --> 06:59.040]  Georgia Guidestones, ladies and gentlemen, are totally and absolutely destroyed, and
[06:59.040 --> 07:04.680]  that has really captured the public's imagination.
[07:04.680 --> 07:09.960]  So again, the live show headline today says it all, Georgia Guidestones completely demolished
[07:09.960 --> 07:21.000]  within hours of mystery bombings, and so much more that we're going to be laying out here
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.360]  today.
[07:24.360 --> 07:29.960]  I really want to try to do my best here today.
[07:29.960 --> 07:34.280]  I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a little while, and then I'm going to come back and
[07:34.280 --> 07:37.160]  try to do the show.
[07:37.160 --> 07:42.480]  But there's just a lot that needs to be discussed and a lot that needs to be broken down obviously
[07:42.480 --> 07:51.120]  here, and we're going to be laying it all out today, the CERN superconducting supercollider.
[07:51.120 --> 07:57.800]  We're going to be looking at the moves against the Second Amendment, the world economy spiraling
[07:57.800 --> 08:00.760]  downward into a black hole.
[08:00.760 --> 08:04.720]  We have the fact that Biden's selling the strategic oil reserves to foreign countries
[08:04.720 --> 08:08.280]  while cutting off our oil supply.
[08:08.280 --> 08:17.080]  It's all coming up here today, but I want to air Ms. Gregory's report.
[08:17.080 --> 08:24.600]  It's very, very important, the demonic dimensions and the mysterious CERN system being fired
[08:24.600 --> 08:33.440]  back up here in just a moment, and then I'm going to continue on with the news and information
[08:33.440 --> 08:34.440]  here today.
[08:34.440 --> 08:35.440]  All right.
[08:35.440 --> 08:45.680]  Let's get to that report.
[08:45.680 --> 08:52.120]  While 80% of the world's population continues on with oil and gas, the United States and
[08:52.120 --> 08:58.400]  a small handful of Western nations have decided to go green, even if it kills everyone.
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.320]  They have already admitted that the disruptive economic burden this will cause is exactly
[09:04.320 --> 09:11.760]  the sort of pressure required to inspire the innovation needed to make it all work someday.
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.200]  Because that's the plan, there are no viable solutions to replace oil and gas, so the sooner
[09:17.200 --> 09:23.240]  we can figure it out, the sooner we can stop the endless rise of inflation, starvation,
[09:23.240 --> 09:28.520]  and death that will obviously result from shutting off our energy taps.
[09:28.520 --> 09:35.160]  And a new company has already appeared, albeit with a bizarre solution to our problems.
[09:35.160 --> 09:41.840]  A massive meat rendering facility is set to break ground next year in Rapid City, South
[09:41.840 --> 09:46.440]  Dakota and be completed by 2026.
[09:46.440 --> 09:52.120]  With the ordinary name, the Western Legacy Development Corporation, one might never guess
[09:52.120 --> 09:55.920]  how innovative this company actually is.
[09:55.920 --> 10:00.480]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will process cattle and bison completely
[10:00.480 --> 10:06.640]  with robotics and artificial intelligence, including new laser technology air knives
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.920]  that use a high velocity airstream to de-hide the animals.
[10:11.920 --> 10:17.080]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation is building a massive one million square
[10:17.080 --> 10:23.640]  foot meat factory that will be operating at levels as high as 8,000 cattle per day.
[10:23.640 --> 10:29.800]  Now, one might ask, what about all this social engineering to stop eating real beef and get
[10:29.800 --> 10:32.920]  used to eating lab grown meat and bugs?
[10:32.920 --> 10:36.960]  Aren't we being told that cow farts are bad for the environment?
[10:36.960 --> 10:42.440]  Well, as it turns out, the Western Legacy Development Corporation isn't necessarily
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.960]  going to be processing 3 million cattle per year for food.
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.080]  The Western Legacy Development Corporation will be collecting animal fat to be used as
[10:52.080 --> 10:58.480]  feed and fuel, a biofuel that they will use to power their very own one million square
[10:58.480 --> 10:59.800]  foot facility.
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.320]  Now, how green is that?
[11:02.320 --> 11:09.440]  Well, maybe not small farm grass fed level green, but still, it's pretty green.
[11:09.440 --> 11:14.960]  Rapid City is a small town and many residents are asking, where will they get 8,000 cattle
[11:14.960 --> 11:15.960]  a day?
[11:15.960 --> 11:17.560]  And where will they keep them?
[11:17.560 --> 11:23.320]  And where will they get 2,500 employees, which is 3% of their population?
[11:23.320 --> 11:25.280]  And where will they house them?
[11:25.280 --> 11:30.080]  These questions weren't really answered, but we do know that they plan to have a thriving
[11:30.080 --> 11:35.680]  rail system that will be offloading thousands of cattle each and every day, directly into
[11:35.680 --> 11:40.560]  the AI robot laser slaughterhouse for immediate processing.
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.040]  So they won't need to store the cattle anywhere.
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.160]  Now, while this may sound like some sort of crazy economist's solution to cleaning up
[11:48.160 --> 11:54.200]  a mass murder, or even some kind of silent green scenario where the government is chopping
[11:54.200 --> 12:02.280]  up people in a factory for food, and in this case, energy.
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.600]  We are told that it's all for the environment, so I'm sure it's all good.
[12:07.600 --> 12:12.120]  And hey, at least we won't be burning any more oil, like the rest of the world.
[12:12.120 --> 12:17.920]  And don't worry, trust the science.
[12:17.920 --> 12:19.600]  And remember the plan.
[12:19.600 --> 12:24.520]  Once we really start suffering, someone will eventually think of a solution.
[12:24.520 --> 12:31.640]  And if not, at least we were willing to die for a criminal government run by pedophiles.
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.720]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[12:35.720 --> 12:43.080]  Here's what's going on, and I'm going to come back and I'm going to talk about this
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.080]  in detail.
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.200]  And when I say this, I'm really disappointed with myself, but I really want to just cut
[12:49.200 --> 12:52.680]  the brass tacks to the very base of what's happening.
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.040]  And I want to explain something to people very, very slowly, and very, very calmly,
[12:57.040 --> 13:04.080]  like this is the last broadcast I'm ever going to do, because I may walk out of here and
[13:04.080 --> 13:05.920]  never come back.
[13:05.920 --> 13:08.920]  I think there's something avant-garde about that.
[13:08.920 --> 13:09.920]  I like the crew.
[13:09.920 --> 13:10.920]  I care about them.
[13:10.920 --> 13:15.840]  I care about the viewers and listeners we've been through a lot.
[13:15.840 --> 13:25.600]  But I think things are so bad, and I really think we do deserve to die.
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.360]  And I've really thought about how to present this to people, and I've thought about doing
[13:32.360 --> 13:39.040]  a satirical show where I am basically supporting Bill Gates, so you get their perspective.
[13:39.040 --> 13:42.800]  But I just don't think, I really don't think that's needed.
[13:42.800 --> 13:47.320]  I think you need to die, just like all the unborn children and all the starving people
[13:47.320 --> 13:48.320]  in the third world.
[13:48.320 --> 13:50.200]  And you will die.
[13:50.200 --> 13:54.800]  I told Rob, Dew, and Darren McBrain, I said, you and your family will be dead in ten years,
[13:54.800 --> 13:55.800]  just so you know.
[13:55.800 --> 13:58.080]  Told me that this morning.
[13:58.080 --> 14:02.760]  And see, I don't say this to be dramatic, I would be a liar if I didn't tell people
[14:02.760 --> 14:06.760]  I care about, you and your family are dead.
[14:06.760 --> 14:12.280]  You see, because behavioral psychologists run this whole thing, and they are introducing
[14:12.280 --> 14:17.080]  us to collapse, and it's getting us comfortable with it, so we all just sit here entertained
[14:17.080 --> 14:19.240]  while we sink into the mud.
[14:19.240 --> 14:23.000]  And I could play you all these incredible clips and make the show incredibly entertaining
[14:23.000 --> 14:27.160]  and still do some good exposing the New World Order, but that doesn't really, at the end
[14:27.160 --> 14:29.560]  of the day, win the war.
[14:29.560 --> 14:32.600]  I mean, all the idiots going along with this, they're the worst.
[14:32.600 --> 14:37.400]  I mean, they think they're on a winning team going along with the New World Order.
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.400]  Then you've got the unwashed unconscious masses, and then you've got those of us that know
[14:41.400 --> 14:46.560]  what's going on, but we still don't really take it seriously, do we?
[14:46.560 --> 14:51.000]  We still don't let it really burn in what's happening.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.600]  You know, I was quite a history buff growing up.
[14:55.600 --> 14:59.360]  I just found it way more entertaining than science fiction and comic books that I was
[14:59.360 --> 15:00.360]  into.
[15:00.360 --> 15:01.360]  It was a great reader.
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.520]  I was reading in like a high school level when I was about six, and as soon as I discovered
[15:07.520 --> 15:12.920]  history at about eight, I didn't read a lot of science fiction or comic books anymore because
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.240]  real stuff was way more interesting.
[15:18.240 --> 15:22.880]  And by the time I was about 14, I was reading, you know, PhD books on geopolitics and the
[15:22.880 --> 15:23.880]  rest of it.
[15:23.880 --> 15:27.560]  I was bragging that I did that, that's what I did.
[15:27.560 --> 15:31.440]  And so then it was more of entertainment for them to know all this.
[15:31.440 --> 15:35.000]  Now it's not so entertaining me having it done to me and my family.
[15:35.000 --> 15:44.000]  So we don't need to blow up the Georgia Guidestones, which has been done.
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.880]  Everybody's celebrating and it's, I can't say I don't like it at the end of the day.
[15:48.880 --> 15:55.440]  We need to blow up politically the ideas of the globalists and defeat them nonviolent.
[15:55.440 --> 15:57.880]  I'm going to try to lay this out when we come back, but if we don't get out of our
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.880]  coma, we're dead.

[16:53.360 --> 17:00.120]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.400]  The Desk Dissues is a new film, 2000 Mules is the most important documentary in modern
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.200]  times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[17:09.200 --> 17:13.960]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[17:13.960 --> 17:17.200]  Now it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch it online but you
[17:17.200 --> 17:23.160]  need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't

[17:56.320 --> 18:05.240]  infowarstore.com to get 2000 Mules today.
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.640]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[18:06.640 --> 18:08.680]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[18:08.680 --> 18:09.680]  It is.
[18:09.680 --> 18:14.120]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[18:14.120 --> 18:17.360]  The fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[18:17.360 --> 18:23.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.800]  Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm just sorry, you want
[18:26.800 --> 18:28.520]  something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[18:28.520 --> 18:31.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good in my view.
[18:31.600 --> 18:34.500]  I'm not making a medical statement here but let me tell you something, I eat five
[18:34.500 --> 18:40.120]  capillots of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[18:40.120 --> 18:47.600]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.040]  So we don't make a big profit off of it but you know what, I just obsess because whatever
[18:51.040 --> 18:54.840]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[18:54.840 --> 18:55.840]  infowarstore.com
[18:55.840 --> 19:09.560]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[19:09.560 --> 19:16.320]  France that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[19:16.320 --> 19:17.320]  lost.
[19:17.320 --> 19:22.480]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[19:22.480 --> 19:30.400]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused,
[19:30.400 --> 19:35.000]  you have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done, they have stunned us.
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.720]  came out and gave him a speech called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the
[19:43.720 --> 19:48.800]  public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are
[19:48.800 --> 19:52.840]  all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[19:52.840 --> 20:00.840]  That's what the Great Recent is, they need darkness to thrive, the light lives at infowars.com
[20:00.840 --> 20:15.040]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:15.040 --> 20:26.160]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[20:26.160 --> 20:27.160]  Jones.
[20:27.160 --> 20:34.080]  So the planet is almost under the complete control of the top by criminal corporations
[20:34.080 --> 20:38.840]  sworn to bring in world government and depopulate us down to 500 million, that's the Georgia
[20:38.840 --> 20:45.120]  Guidestone State, that's the official UN policy, that's what comes out of Ted Turner and David
[20:45.120 --> 20:53.360]  Rockefeller and Prince Charles and Prince Philip and Bill Gates' filthy, murderous mouths.
[20:53.360 --> 20:56.440]  So let's just cut to the chase here with everybody.
[20:56.440 --> 21:00.760]  They're using behavioral psychology against us and if you don't fully wake up what they're
[21:00.760 --> 21:05.800]  doing and just understand it's a program of attack and then resist it instead of debating
[21:05.800 --> 21:10.500]  and arguing every disinfo piece they put out, it's over.
[21:10.500 --> 21:17.920]  We need a sense of urgency to cut through the propaganda and the lies and to bring out
[21:17.920 --> 21:22.960]  what is happening in the real world in front of everyone that collapsed the third world
[21:22.960 --> 21:27.320]  by shutting them down under IMF World Bank Control during two plus years of lockdowns
[21:27.320 --> 21:30.920]  to flood the first world and bring us down.
[21:30.920 --> 21:35.920]  The accelerated devaluation of our currencies and weaponized inflation against the middle-class
[21:35.920 --> 21:39.960]  and small businesses to get rid of the globalist competition and any infrastructure that could
[21:39.960 --> 21:45.080]  help the public and ever regrow a real economy.
[21:45.080 --> 21:50.920]  You've all heard the story of the frog in the pot and it's true.
[21:50.920 --> 21:57.000]  If you throw a frog into cold water and slowly turn up the heat it'll slowly get warm and
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.520]  then hot and then boiling and the frog will roll over and die.
[22:00.520 --> 22:08.840]  If you throw a frog into boiling water it will jump out and we should call this the
[22:08.840 --> 22:13.160]  boiled frog society because everything revolves around that with behavioral psychology.
[22:13.160 --> 22:19.280]  And again, I don't say this like it's cool, do you understand because you have off record
[22:19.280 --> 22:26.720]  meetings that are off record and I've never violated that.
[22:26.720 --> 22:30.400]  That they told me all this and they said you're not going to stop us, the public's too weak,
[22:30.400 --> 22:32.240]  they have to be dealt with.
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.400]  And if you behave like that and if you don't rise to the occasion and get out of your trance
[22:36.400 --> 22:42.000]  then they believe metaphysically they're allowed to slowly dumb you down, impoverish you, suck
[22:42.000 --> 22:45.040]  everything out of you and kill you.
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.040]  So before the break I was starting to pontificate about reading a lot of history books.
[22:49.040 --> 22:54.360]  I mean I don't want to exaggerate, I probably read a hundred books on the Roman Empire.
[22:54.360 --> 22:55.360]  Very fascinating.
[22:55.360 --> 23:00.920]  From the rise of the Republic and the Golden Era and then the long decline for 400 years
[23:00.920 --> 23:09.080]  up to Julius Caesar, marking from Caesar 400 years forward to the sacking of Rome by Visigas
[23:09.080 --> 23:10.080]  in 410.
[23:10.080 --> 23:16.280]  And I remember reading the Roman histories that were written at the time and survived
[23:16.280 --> 23:20.640]  and the Jewish histories, they wrote a lot of history as well.
[23:20.640 --> 23:26.560]  When they matched up they were basically the same report and they were Persian histories
[23:26.560 --> 23:28.080]  of what happened to the Romans.
[23:28.080 --> 23:40.560]  But I remember reading about how as the Roman Empire began to implode
[23:40.560 --> 23:44.680]  they would have the barbarians coming closer and closer to Rome and taking routinely more
[23:44.680 --> 23:51.200]  and more of Italy that the Roman city-state and empire was based in.
[23:51.200 --> 23:57.120]  And finally in the last year before Rome fell the scouts and the generals were bringing
[23:57.120 --> 24:00.680]  back reports saying we've got to raise taxes, we've got to mobilize troops, we've got to
[24:00.680 --> 24:06.440]  push them back over the Rubicon River, they are about to sack Rome and the decadent population
[24:06.440 --> 24:10.720]  not just the elite said that will never happen, it's impossible, we can't fall just like we
[24:10.720 --> 24:18.560]  think America can't fall.
[24:18.560 --> 24:21.760]  And then of course it all got sacked and burned down.
[24:21.760 --> 24:30.560]  Part of the Roman Empire lived on for a long time until the Muslims sacked Constantinople
[24:30.560 --> 24:38.080]  and that was the final nail in the coffin of what we knew as a civilization.
[24:38.080 --> 24:39.440]  And it's the exact same thing here.
[24:39.440 --> 24:46.160]  I mean we, the barbarians have had their country shut down and they're starving to death, they're
[24:46.160 --> 24:49.320]  coming here millions a month.
[24:49.320 --> 24:58.040]  A quarter of the population of Central America has migrated here in the last two years.
[24:58.040 --> 25:02.760]  They have no jobs, they have no future, they'll be organized into political army in a permanent
[25:02.760 --> 25:03.760]  underclass.
[25:03.760 --> 25:06.560]  They're not our enemy but they're being used as a weapon.
[25:06.560 --> 25:11.240]  A battle axe is not my enemy but if someone's hitting me in the head with it, it's killing
[25:11.240 --> 25:12.240]  me.
[25:12.240 --> 25:18.040]  So I don't hate them, I just know they're a weapon.
[25:18.040 --> 25:20.880]  They've already been hit by the same globalist hitting us, they're actually our brothers
[25:20.880 --> 25:22.280]  and sisters.
[25:22.280 --> 25:25.440]  But just because you're in a lifeboat that can hold 20 people and 100 want to climb
[25:25.440 --> 25:28.400]  on board, you're all going to die.
[25:28.400 --> 25:33.800]  Instead of stopping the UN policies that collapse their countries, we'll now mitigate them flooding
[25:33.800 --> 25:39.160]  us which is unmitigatable.
[25:39.160 --> 25:47.240]  So here's where we are, if we don't have a sense of urgency, if we don't have a sense
[25:47.240 --> 25:55.960]  of commitment to expose this and if we don't move against it, we are going to lose.
[25:55.960 --> 26:00.680]  And I'm not going to join the globalist, I can make one phone call still and all their
[26:00.680 --> 26:07.120]  attacks, all their lawsuits, all their deep platforming, it will all end just like that.
[26:07.120 --> 26:14.120]  I can snap my fingers and join them like that.
[26:14.120 --> 26:20.960]  But my soul is on the line and I'm not going to sell my soul for 30 pieces of silver.
[26:20.960 --> 26:24.840]  But those of you that want to live in denial, those of you that serve the system, do you
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.720]  know how much grave danger you're in?
[26:28.720 --> 26:32.840]  You realize you're useful idiots that lower the drawbridge to the enemy and then you don't
[26:32.840 --> 26:36.880]  think once the enemy takes over, you're not the first people they're going to imprison,
[26:36.880 --> 26:40.960]  the first people they're going to string up.
[26:40.960 --> 26:50.760]  These takeovers throughout history always as the default kill the traders.
[26:50.760 --> 26:57.240]  And they finally come to those that fought and say you were not traders and we know
[26:57.240 --> 26:59.000]  you're men of your words.
[26:59.000 --> 27:09.440]  We want you to manage your people now or we're going to kill your children.
[27:09.440 --> 27:13.600]  They'll come to me once you've all been destroyed.
[27:13.600 --> 27:18.760]  And they'll say, Jones, now do you finally see we want you to help manage these people?
[27:18.760 --> 27:22.000]  We want you to help now reorganize things.
[27:22.000 --> 27:29.800]  See I don't want to get to that point when they got a gun to my family's head.
[27:29.800 --> 27:33.400]  And just like I told you what was coming in the future, I'm telling you what's coming
[27:33.400 --> 27:37.200]  now and it will happen.
[27:37.200 --> 27:42.320]  It may not happen exactly on the day I predicted it might happen, but it'll happen.
[27:42.320 --> 27:43.760]  I mean, let me explain something to you.
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.640]  I don't just have Roger Stone who talked to Trump last week who said he's going to announce
[27:47.640 --> 27:48.640]  in July.
[27:48.640 --> 27:49.640]  He might change his mind.
[27:49.640 --> 27:52.800]  I don't just have other Congress people I've talked to that have met with Trump.
[27:52.800 --> 27:53.800]  He is running.
[27:53.800 --> 27:55.680]  He is set to announce.
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.760]  He said he might do it on July 4th, probably would, but would do it by the end of July.
[27:59.760 --> 28:03.360]  And now his plane is repainted with a big American flag on it and he released a video
[28:03.360 --> 28:06.200]  of that.
[28:06.200 --> 28:12.600]  Just because what Alex Jones predicts doesn't come true right when I think is the spot doesn't
[28:12.600 --> 28:15.480]  mean it's not going to come true.
[28:15.480 --> 28:17.680]  But I'm not always right.
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.520]  Sometimes we expose the globalists and fight them and they back off.
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.560]  But I live in this fight.
[28:24.560 --> 28:28.520]  This is all I do.
[28:28.520 --> 28:31.760]  And when you finally wake up to the fact you're under attack and you look around, you'll realize
[28:31.760 --> 28:32.760]  how real this is.
[28:32.760 --> 28:36.360]  And I just want to say to the people that are under delusion and serving the enemy, you're
[28:36.360 --> 28:37.360]  fools.
[28:37.360 --> 28:40.040]  I mean, you'll be destroyed just like us.
[28:40.040 --> 28:42.920]  And to the people on the bench, man, I really feel sorry for you.
[28:42.920 --> 28:47.640]  But for those of us that are awake, we better all be the most active we've ever been now.
[28:47.640 --> 28:50.640]  Because our lives depend on it.
[28:50.640 --> 28:51.640]  We'll be right back.

[30:52.080 --> 30:54.080]  Quite well, I might add.
[30:54.080 --> 30:58.080]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.160]  I go and see him quite often now.
[31:00.160 --> 31:06.640]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[31:06.640 --> 31:10.920]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[31:10.920 --> 31:16.680]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[31:16.680 --> 31:18.120]  be grateful for.
[31:18.120 --> 31:23.640]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[31:23.640 --> 31:26.120]  your taps getting shut off.
[31:26.120 --> 31:31.640]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[31:31.640 --> 31:36.080]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[31:36.080 --> 31:38.880]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[31:38.880 --> 31:44.400]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.080]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[31:49.080 --> 31:54.160]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[31:54.160 --> 32:12.920]  Back up now at PrepareToday.com.
[32:12.920 --> 32:18.320]  High quality, storable food is now back in stock, ready to ship to you and your family.
[32:18.320 --> 32:22.600]  We've not sold food for three months because there was a wait.
[32:22.600 --> 32:24.440]  Now there is not a wait.
[32:24.440 --> 32:28.760]  Almost every other storable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food
[32:28.760 --> 32:33.680]  for months if ever, and the prices are exploding.
[32:33.680 --> 32:37.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent
[32:37.920 --> 32:38.920]  on the system.
[32:38.920 --> 32:40.920]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.
[32:40.920 --> 32:44.880]  We have the best deals on high quality, storable food and a whole spectrum of preparedness
[32:44.880 --> 32:49.320]  and survival items right now at PrepareToday.com.

[33:00.920 --> 33:20.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:20.920 --> 33:31.600]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[33:31.600 --> 33:35.760]  So my friends, the hour is not late, the hour is not two minutes to midnight to be inside
[33:35.760 --> 33:37.080]  the jaws of the New World Order.
[33:37.080 --> 33:40.720]  We are now in the jaws of this giant snake.
[33:40.720 --> 33:48.760]  We are now being swallowed head first because we're in a coma into the stinking black satanic
[33:48.760 --> 33:54.040]  maw of the technocracy.
[33:54.040 --> 34:02.120]  Yes, there's a lot of positive news, yes, a lot of humanity is starting to wake up,
[34:02.120 --> 34:05.920]  but if you just wake up to the New World Order and you don't stand against it, if you don't
[34:05.920 --> 34:10.400]  resist it, if you don't pray against it, if you don't economically fight it, if you don't
[34:10.400 --> 34:14.000]  politically resist it, you will be destroyed.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.120]  Being awake when you're lined up in front of a firing squad doesn't save you.
[34:20.120 --> 34:26.840]  I've got a lot of news and a lot of calls and a lot of information to get to here today,
[34:26.840 --> 34:31.680]  but I just want to impart urgency on the viewers and listeners and on the prominent people
[34:31.680 --> 34:38.400]  that tune in daily to this show, this broadcast to realize just how serious the cost is and
[34:38.400 --> 34:43.080]  that it is extremely painful to face the truth, but it is the only way to make it through
[34:43.080 --> 34:53.920]  this, and that's why when I see their systematic annihilation of the Western world, their systematic
[34:53.920 --> 35:06.320]  destruction and collapse of the Third World, the systematic ordered great reset and I just
[35:06.320 --> 35:14.720]  look at our enemies getting away with it and smiling and laughing, it is so painful to know
[35:14.720 --> 35:17.720]  what's coming next, and I'll tell you, I'm not going to walk out of here, I'm not going
[35:17.720 --> 35:22.520]  to stop doing the broadcast, but where we're going with the surveillance and the censorship
[35:22.520 --> 35:29.760]  and the debanking and the attacks is that place regardless, and so I am simply preparing
[35:29.760 --> 35:36.200]  myself and preparing you, because if you're not mentally and spiritually prepared, if
[35:36.200 --> 35:43.520]  you're not right with God about what is currently going down, you and I and nobody else has
[35:43.520 --> 35:51.680]  a hope in hell.
[35:51.680 --> 35:59.400]  The United States is under systematic attack from without them within, and if you think
[35:59.400 --> 36:07.600]  things are bad now, I will assure you, you will look back in 2022 as the good old days.
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.200]  This is I told you in the year 2020, you'd look in a few years as that is the good old
[36:12.200 --> 36:14.080]  days.
[36:14.080 --> 36:18.240]  Right on time, they're announcing the carbon lockdowns, right on time, they're announcing
[36:18.240 --> 36:24.960]  the ban of cows, right on time, they're announcing open pedophilia, right on time, they're announcing
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.760]  they're not going to test any of the so-called vaccines and just force them on you now, it
[36:29.760 --> 36:38.640]  is so diabolical, so illegal, so outrageous, I have the insurance actuaries and the new
[36:38.640 --> 36:43.440]  Pfizer documents that were forced to release by a court, and it's confirming triple the
[36:43.440 --> 36:49.040]  deaths of people that have been taking the shots, mass death in children and young people,
[36:49.040 --> 37:02.160]  mass autoimmune disorders, just this stack alone is enough to make a grown man cry.
[37:02.160 --> 37:09.360]  And then I've got a stack of news, a prominent leftist caught recruiting and raping children
[37:09.360 --> 37:14.640]  and with child porn and people say well that's good news, they're getting busted, exactly,
[37:14.640 --> 37:20.320]  that's why they're racing to normalize it, that's one stack.
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.640]  This stack ties into what I was just talking about, you in the very group, the very front
[37:25.640 --> 37:31.480]  group running all this that ran the policies of lockdowns, reports of 345 million people
[37:31.480 --> 37:36.280]  are marching to the brink of starvation, an extra 30 million people, it was 15 extra million
[37:36.280 --> 37:43.640]  are starving to death each year because of the COVID lockdowns.
[37:43.640 --> 37:47.680]  Those are real people starving to death, those are real people dying, and here it's
[37:47.680 --> 37:52.040]  just an article, it's just a statistic, it's just a number.
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.480]  Do you feel safe when that's happening to these people?
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.680]  Does that make you sleep good at night?
[37:59.680 --> 38:02.160]  Does that concern you?
[38:02.160 --> 38:09.560]  And then we've got the Georgia Guidestone News, we've got mainstream media saying Trump's
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.800]  got his new plane repainted for 2024 ready with a big American flag on it, and we've
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.320]  got Boris Johnson resigning, we've got the big economic stack of news, we've got more
[38:20.320 --> 38:27.080]  Disneyland employees caught being pedophiles, we've got Army cuts off more than 60,000 troops,
[38:27.080 --> 38:34.840]  unvaccinated guard and reserve soldiers from paying benefits, we've got massive Hadron,
[38:34.840 --> 38:46.160]  superconducting, supercollider news, we've got it all, all the new pushes for gun control,
[38:46.160 --> 38:48.760]  all over here.
[38:48.760 --> 39:03.120]  But what is the progenitor, what is the generator, what is the fount, what is the place from
[39:03.120 --> 39:09.360]  which this flows, and it is the psychotic globalist.
[39:09.360 --> 39:15.800]  You know, Boris Johnson posed as a patriot and brought an incredible tyranny, and now
[39:15.800 --> 39:21.040]  he's being flushed down the proverbial historical drain.
[39:21.040 --> 39:23.480]  And that's the same story for Joe Biden.
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.960]  So I don't like Boris Johnson, I don't like Joe Biden, but if you focus your disgust
[39:28.960 --> 39:37.040]  with them like a row of shark teeth, they'll fall out, and a new row will row forward.
[39:37.040 --> 39:43.960]  A new row will swing into play, and then you'll blame that row of teeth.
[39:43.960 --> 39:46.120]  And then another row of teeth will come forward.
[39:46.120 --> 39:54.560]  Instead of blaming the shark, the megalodonic, satanic, transhumanist system attacking, he'll
[39:54.560 --> 39:59.320]  be given hundreds of millions of dollars, he'll be rehabilitated, he'll be promoted to the
[39:59.320 --> 40:05.680]  UN for his job well done, but he is just a puppet.
[40:05.680 --> 40:09.880]  So the whole sport of making fun of Biden, and we're guilty of it too, and the whole
[40:09.880 --> 40:15.200]  sport of laughing at Kamala Harris, yeah, they're pathetic because they're slaves, because
[40:15.200 --> 40:19.040]  they're placeholders, because they're minions, because they're front people, because they're
[40:19.040 --> 40:26.280]  foils, because they're quizlings, because they're Benedict Arnold's.
[40:26.280 --> 40:35.240]  We have to identify the ruling globalist cabal that put up those Georgia guide stones.
[40:35.240 --> 40:41.600]  As the central cancer from which everything else metastasizes, and the good news is that's
[40:41.600 --> 40:43.600]  happening.
[40:43.600 --> 40:49.880]  It was the first three months ago to start beating the drum to impeach Joe Biden.
[40:49.880 --> 40:53.680]  Even if they don't have the votes, it'll focus on his crimes and who controls him, and it's
[40:53.680 --> 40:57.960]  the right thing to do when someone's cutting off your energy, annihilating your borders,
[40:57.960 --> 41:03.560]  promoting pedophilia, launching wars, destroying the currency, creating division, trying to
[41:03.560 --> 41:13.240]  force poison inoculations, to take control of the narrative, and to put him on trial.
[41:13.240 --> 41:18.880]  Thank God Tucker Carlson came out, and seconded that last night, and so is MTG, and so have
[41:18.880 --> 41:21.480]  many other great leaders.
[41:21.480 --> 41:28.160]  And so I say to this audience of activists, I salute you for taking action and setting
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.040]  brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, and doing what you've done the
[41:32.040 --> 41:35.080]  last three months, hammering that point.
[41:35.080 --> 41:41.280]  And it's in that example that we can move forward and we can win.
[41:41.280 --> 41:47.600]  Move the puppet by, remove the other puppets.
[41:47.600 --> 41:51.520]  Let the globalists know we won't put up with their crap and make sure the next person they
[41:51.520 --> 41:54.560]  try to insert doesn't try what they've done again.
[41:54.560 --> 41:59.400]  You identify them, you turn the lights on, it's game over.
[41:59.400 --> 42:05.560]  I'm going to give the number out right now to cover any issue or any topic you want to
[42:05.560 --> 42:10.440]  discuss, the guide stones, the economy, strategic oil reserve being sold to foreign governments
[42:10.440 --> 42:13.000]  while our pipelines are shut off.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.520]  All of it is coming up in the next hour.
[42:15.520 --> 42:26.280]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539.
[42:26.280 --> 42:30.080]  You can disagree, you can agree, you can be a first time caller, you can be a regular
[42:30.080 --> 42:31.080]  caller.
[42:31.080 --> 42:36.720]  We want to hear from you at 877-789-2539, and we will hit.
[42:36.720 --> 42:39.120]  I'm going to look at all this news during the break, and I'm going to think what's most
[42:39.120 --> 42:43.760]  important, and I'm going to come back and cover it when we come back in T-minus 4 minutes
[42:43.760 --> 42:44.760]  straight ahead.
[42:44.760 --> 42:50.680]  But remember, this is not a spectator sport, this is the fight for liberty, overriding the
[42:50.680 --> 42:59.520]  sensors is paramount, is central, is critical, so share the links and share the information.
[42:59.520 --> 43:08.320]  The July 4th, 2022 Supercell is live and only running for one week exclusively at infowarstore.com.

[43:18.720 --> 43:21.400]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year.
[43:21.400 --> 43:24.920]  Some of these products we're selling at below cost, you've got to move them out of the warehouse
[43:24.920 --> 43:27.240]  to be able to continue to stay on the air.
[43:27.240 --> 43:31.480]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip
[43:31.480 --> 43:37.400]  of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[43:37.400 --> 43:41.320]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America, and I would
[43:41.320 --> 43:47.640]  encourage you to join the fight even harder now, because we're so close to winning, infowarstore.com
[43:47.640 --> 43:53.560]  and celebrate July 4th, 1776, Part 2, against the New World Order, because the answer to
[43:53.560 --> 44:02.680]  1984 is 1776.
[44:02.680 --> 44:09.680]  Thank you very much for your time, and I'll see you in the next video.
[27:45.620 --> 45:00.200]  and I'll see you in the next video.
[45:00.200 --> 45:07.200]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
[45:30.200 --> 45:59.600]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.
[45:59.600 --> 46:06.600]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here, and that's
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.160]  what people recognize and resonate with, and as Ward said, you're not going to find a
[46:11.160 --> 46:13.400]  better place for information.
[46:13.400 --> 46:16.760]  You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.400]  cover all the information, and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[46:21.400 --> 46:22.840]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[46:22.840 --> 46:27.040]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarstore.com is where to
[46:27.040 --> 46:29.200]  get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements.
[46:29.200 --> 46:35.360]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the
[46:35.360 --> 46:37.920]  best with our supplements as well.
[46:37.920 --> 46:42.320]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke, I mean, we're
[46:42.320 --> 46:44.920]  giving this thing away, it's 75% off.
[46:44.920 --> 46:48.840]  By the way, it works for me, and in case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula
[46:48.840 --> 46:51.480]  is working for me.
[46:51.480 --> 46:57.520]  Quite well, I might add, quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men,
[46:57.520 --> 46:59.520]  and I go and see him quite often now.
[47:27.520 --> 47:41.280]  When you have empathy, when you're connected to everybody, when you're dialed in to God,
[47:41.280 --> 47:46.480]  like I know somebody on YouTube did right now, are very painful to watch what's happening,
[47:46.480 --> 47:52.920]  but it's all part of it, separating the wheat from the chaff, the gold from the pewter,
[47:52.920 --> 47:55.520]  the clay from the silver.
[47:55.520 --> 48:03.520]  And that's where we are today, making a decision about infinity, about eternity.
[48:03.520 --> 48:09.480]  We're taking your phone calls coming up next hour, phone lines are watered up right now,
[48:09.480 --> 48:15.920]  but I just want to say this, just like they put the frog into the cold water and slowly
[48:15.920 --> 48:22.160]  turn up the heat, they're killing us, and we have to recognize it, we have to become
[48:22.160 --> 48:28.600]  conscious, we have to become aware of it, and we have to not submit to it.
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.320]  We have to know where we are, recognize we're under attack, and we have to climb out.
[48:34.320 --> 48:41.640]  And the process of climbing out of that hot water, it's now killing us.
[48:41.640 --> 48:46.440]  We have to warn others, because even if you don't care about the general public or your
[48:46.440 --> 48:52.040]  fellow man, which I know most of you do, we need them to save us.
[48:52.040 --> 48:55.240]  They need us to save them.
[48:55.240 --> 49:00.920]  That is the golden rule, do unto others as you have done unto you, and Christ said, I'll
[49:00.920 --> 49:02.420]  take it further.
[49:02.420 --> 49:07.720]  No greater thing can a man do than lay down his life for his brother or a stranger.
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.400]  Now that sounds very selfless, and it is, and it's done from a place of goodness.
[49:13.400 --> 49:17.800]  But you know the type of society we'll live in where people will lay down their life for
[49:17.800 --> 49:22.160]  their brother or sister or their neighbor or someone they don't know?
[49:22.160 --> 49:24.400]  That's a good society.
[49:24.400 --> 49:29.680]  That's a strong society, and that's a safe society, and a prosperous society, and a creative
[49:29.680 --> 49:36.240]  society, and an amazing society.
[49:36.240 --> 49:44.000]  So really, not being willing to lay down your life, you lose your life.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  You know that.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.360]  It's a fact.
[49:46.360 --> 49:48.960]  And that's where our evil cities are.
[49:48.960 --> 49:50.360]  That's where our corrupt towns are.
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.160]  That's where our out of control families are.
[49:54.160 --> 49:57.320]  And please know, I'm not on some high horse.
[49:57.320 --> 50:03.760]  I am a lustful, aggressive, savage person.
[50:03.760 --> 50:12.280]  I'm repented of it, but when somebody attacks me, I enjoy beating their brains out.
[50:12.280 --> 50:19.680]  I repent.
[50:19.680 --> 50:24.120]  I don't fight the globalists to beat their brains out.
[50:24.120 --> 50:28.320]  I fight them to get them off our children, and I fight them because God has commanded
[50:28.320 --> 50:30.320]  me to do so.
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.680]  All right, a lot of this is, I've been doing this 28 years on air.
[50:34.680 --> 50:38.320]  I come in here, I look at all this news, I was looking at it last night this morning,
[50:38.320 --> 50:47.960]  and it's just insane, and I don't want to say I'm tired, but it's like eating your vomit
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.960]  to read all this, to watch all these clips, and then to play it.
[50:51.960 --> 50:53.720]  I don't know how to explain it.
[50:53.720 --> 51:02.000]  It's like doing play-by-play commentary on the destruction of the human race is not
[51:02.000 --> 51:09.120]  like being maddened, giving play-by-play for the NFL.
[51:09.120 --> 51:14.680]  This is not entertainment.
[51:14.680 --> 51:21.120]  And when I get to this place sometimes, this is when I have trouble even doing the show,
[51:21.120 --> 51:27.200]  because I'm trying to force myself to cover this, and I don't want to look at the Netflix
[51:27.200 --> 51:30.520]  pedophile star.
[51:30.520 --> 51:34.560]  I don't want to look at the latest videos we've got.
[51:34.560 --> 51:38.640]  I said within one year they'll be having sex with children at the sex bars, it's basically
[51:38.640 --> 51:39.640]  already started.
[51:39.640 --> 51:44.520]  And then there's a whole paradox of we shouldn't even play stuff like this on air, but then
[51:44.520 --> 51:51.680]  how the hell do you warn people it's going on?
[51:51.680 --> 51:55.560]  So I'm going to do this.
[51:55.560 --> 52:02.000]  I'm going to do what I know I need to do, and then I'm going to move on.
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.120]  We need your funding to stay on air.
[52:04.120 --> 52:07.560]  I don't want to prove to you how much we need funding to stay on air by imploding or shutting
[52:07.560 --> 52:08.560]  down.
[52:08.560 --> 52:10.800]  I want to thank you all for your previous support, plus we've got great products you
[52:10.800 --> 52:11.800]  need.
[52:11.800 --> 52:15.840]  Everybody listening to get off the fence, get off the bench, those that haven't supported,
[52:15.840 --> 52:18.520]  those that haven't bought products particularly, because I know a lot of you have done more
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.880]  than you should, you know you've got great products.
[52:20.880 --> 52:25.640]  And just to go to infowarstore.com with the big July 4th special, everybody needs a multivitamin
[52:25.640 --> 52:27.840]  mineral.
[52:27.840 --> 52:31.000]  And we did a hair and beard support, but it's just a really strong multivitamin mineral.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.560]  Men, women, children, it's great, of course it makes your hair grow better and be healthier,
[52:34.560 --> 52:37.080]  because it's a high-end multivitamin mineral.
[52:37.080 --> 52:43.200]  This below cost at 75% off, because a lot of the stuff sells out in their best sellers,
[52:43.200 --> 52:45.800]  people don't want hair and beard formula.
[52:45.800 --> 52:51.120]  So we've got a bunch of that, not soon, it's selling very fast now.
[52:51.120 --> 52:52.920]  So get that at infowarstore.com.
[52:52.920 --> 52:57.120]  Get X2, which will sell out, there's a total game changer, it's the best seller, 40% off.
[52:57.120 --> 53:00.200]  Find out what the iodine deficiencies in almost everybody have done.
[53:00.200 --> 53:03.640]  Take pure iodine that goes right into your cells, right into your blood, total atomic
[53:03.640 --> 53:04.640]  iodine, infowarstore.com.
[53:04.640 --> 53:08.000]  I don't get anything else you've ever taken.
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.400]  Get the krill oil, get the fish oil, get the phasyl beats, get the ultra-twelve, highest
[53:11.400 --> 53:16.980]  quality B12 bag of stock, and keep us on air, ladies and gentlemen, while getting great
[53:16.980 --> 53:18.480]  products at the same time.
[53:18.480 --> 53:21.680]  And I got to tell you, we got big donations a few months ago, I thought it put us way
[53:21.680 --> 53:25.640]  in the black, done all the accounting and numbers, it's biblical.
[53:25.640 --> 53:29.760]  It's exactly what we needed just to get fair and square, just to pay our back bills for
[53:29.760 --> 53:32.720]  bandwidth and everything else, and you name it.
[53:32.720 --> 53:37.600]  Oh man, everything was in the rears, I didn't know how bad it was, and now I'm barely in
[53:37.600 --> 53:40.720]  the black, I need to not spend all my time raising money, I'm not bitching, but I need
[53:40.720 --> 53:46.600]  your support, infowarstore.com, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[53:46.600 --> 53:53.440]  nine, and for all the preparedness items, the storeable food ready to ship, preparetoday.com,
[53:53.440 --> 53:54.440]  preparetoday.com.
[53:54.440 --> 53:58.520]  Alright, we're going to start the next hour, go to your phone calls, cover all the news,
[53:58.520 --> 54:02.480]  and so much more, but here's Tucker Carlson last night calling, it was a long 15-minute
[54:02.480 --> 54:05.880]  segment, here's three minutes of it, three and a half minutes of it, calling for the
[54:05.880 --> 54:09.480]  impeachment of Joe Biden, and why it's so important because he is the figurehead destroying
[54:09.480 --> 54:11.480]  our country, and we'll be right back, stay with us.
[54:11.480 --> 54:15.680]  One point of the Joe Biden presidency is to humiliate the rest of us and think less of
[54:15.680 --> 54:17.880]  our own country, the place where we were born.
[54:17.880 --> 54:22.600]  You could just imagine Barack Obama and Susan Rice and Ron, clean people who truly disliked
[54:22.600 --> 54:26.440]  the United States as currently constituted, saying, let's make this guy president, that
[54:26.440 --> 54:29.720]  will grind it in their face, a guy who can barely talk.
[54:29.720 --> 54:33.480]  So it's hard to hear anything Joe Biden says because it's hard for him to say anything,
[54:33.480 --> 54:37.800]  but if you listen carefully or read a transcript, you will learn what he just said, is we're
[54:37.800 --> 54:44.840]  releasing a million barrels per day for a total of more than 180 million barrels from
[54:44.840 --> 54:48.720]  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is held in Caverns in a couple of states.
[54:48.720 --> 54:49.720]  How much is that?
[54:49.720 --> 54:51.080]  It's a staggering figure.
[54:51.080 --> 54:52.480]  So let's put it in context.
[54:52.480 --> 54:57.240]  The reserve can hold more than 700 million barrels total, but it didn't have that because
[54:57.240 --> 55:03.160]  Congress, by the way, as you haven't been paying attention, has been selling off our
[55:03.160 --> 55:08.120]  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay off debt.
[55:08.120 --> 55:11.080]  So by the time Joe Biden arrived, there was far less than that.
[55:11.080 --> 55:16.200]  There was about 568 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[55:16.200 --> 55:20.840]  Now no president in American history has ordered a drawdown this large.
[55:20.840 --> 55:25.080]  In 1991, the beginning of Operation Desert Storm, which was an actual war with real American
[55:25.080 --> 55:29.600]  soldiers involved, the U.S. government released 17 million barrels of oil as a way of assuring
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.960]  a stable supply of global crude.
[55:31.960 --> 55:35.440]  The U.S. released just 20 million barrels after Hurricane Katrina destroyed parts of
[55:35.440 --> 55:37.680]  the Gulf Coast where so many refineries are.
[55:37.680 --> 55:43.640]  But now we're releasing many times that figure from the reserve, all to protect the Democratic
[55:43.640 --> 55:49.160]  Party from getting what it deserves in the midterm elections in November.
[55:49.160 --> 55:54.000]  And as a result of that, unbelievably reckless, in fact, criminal decision, our strategic oil
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.040]  reserves are at their lowest level in nearly 40 years and they are dropping fast.
[55:58.040 --> 56:00.320]  Again, none of this needed to happen.
[56:00.320 --> 56:05.320]  There was no reason to tap our Strategic Petroleum Reserve when we could produce the energy here
[56:05.320 --> 56:09.480]  and were in fact producing until Joe Biden took office.
[56:09.480 --> 56:13.280]  But at the same time, you have to be honest, principles of supply and demand would suggest
[56:13.280 --> 56:16.000]  that this would work in the short term.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.360]  Releasing all this oil should have lowered gas prices until the reserve ran out, which
[56:20.360 --> 56:21.360]  it will.
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.640]  So you inject more petroleum into the market and prices for gas should drop.
[56:25.640 --> 56:28.720]  But here's the amazing thing, that's not happening.
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.280]  Since Joe Biden started releasing all this oil from our reserves, which he does not own,
[56:33.280 --> 56:34.280]  you do.
[56:34.280 --> 56:35.280]  We do.
[56:35.280 --> 56:36.280]  What has happened to gas prices?
[56:36.280 --> 56:37.280]  They haven't dropped.
[56:37.280 --> 56:40.480]  They've kept going up, huh?
[56:40.480 --> 56:45.720]  In mid-June, the price of both regular unleaded and diesel critically hit all-time highs,
[56:45.720 --> 56:47.360]  well over five bucks a gallon nationally.
[56:47.360 --> 56:49.200]  How could this be?
[56:49.200 --> 56:50.920]  It really was a mystery.
[56:50.920 --> 56:53.080]  It violated the most basic rules of economics.
[56:53.080 --> 56:57.000]  But now, thanks to new report in Reuters, we know why.
[56:57.000 --> 57:00.960]  It turns out the oil being released isn't for us.
[57:00.960 --> 57:04.280]  It's going to India and China.
[57:04.280 --> 57:07.800]  According to Reuters, and we're quoting, more than 5 million barrels of oil that were part
[57:07.800 --> 57:13.240]  of a historic U.S. emergency reserve release to lower domestic fuel prices were exported
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.800]  to Europe and Asia last month.
[57:16.800 --> 57:22.320]  The piece continues, quote, cargo of SPR crude oil from our reserves were also headed to
[57:22.320 --> 57:27.040]  the Netherlands into a reliance refinery in India, an industry source said.
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.080]  A third cargo, Buckle your seatbelt, headed to China.
[57:31.080 --> 57:32.800]  To China.
[57:32.800 --> 57:39.280]  So as gas prices set records in this country, as American citizens were born here and vote
[57:39.280 --> 57:44.240]  and pay taxes, cannot afford to fuel their own cars, the Biden administration is selling
[57:44.240 --> 57:50.200]  off our emergency oil reserves to China.
[57:50.200 --> 57:55.160]  We have a giant sale going right now of amazing products that you and your family really,

[59:44.640 --> 59:45.640]  PrepareToday.com.
[59:45.640 --> 59:52.640]  And I'll see you there.
[59:52.640 --> 59:59.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:38.520]  Here's part of the Red Racers Report, CERN, and we'll take your phone calls.
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:44.720]  CERN is an acronym that translates to European Council for Nuclear Research but has since
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:48.280]  moved on to studying particle physics.
[1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:54.840]  And even though they invented the Internet in 1989, they are most famous for their 666
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:01:01.880]  logo, a video of a woman being ritually sacrificed on CERN grounds at the altar of Shiva, the
[1:01:01.880 --> 1:01:09.040]  Hindu god of destruction, and for potentially destroying the universe.
[1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:14.920]  Multiple lawsuits have been filed to stop CERN's particle collider in fear that it could
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:22.800]  destroy the Earth, which revealed to the public that CERN is a sovereign entity outside the
[1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:27.320]  jurisdiction of the courts so they can do whatever they want.
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:28.920]  What is it that they're doing?
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:34.680]  It has to do with high-velocity counter-rotational spin, which was first documented in Nazi
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:39.680]  Germany's most secret program, de Gloc, the Bell.
[1:01:39.680 --> 1:01:44.880]  According to surviving documents, the bell was somehow affecting time and space.
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:50.560]  The most distinctive aspect of the bell was high-velocity counter-rotational spin, also
[1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:53.720]  known as torsion physics.
[1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:59.200]  Many are concerned that CERN is attempting to open a portal into another dimension that
[1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:03.440]  will allow demonic entities to enter ours.
[1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:08.760]  This was blatantly portrayed six years ago in a pagan ritual to celebrate the opening
[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:12.360]  of the Gothard Tunnel, just east of CERN.
[1:02:12.360 --> 1:02:18.120]  The dimension they would be attempting to open is already somewhat accessible.
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:20.340]  Do you hear voices in your head?
[1:02:20.340 --> 1:02:25.640]  If you do, then you likely know it's best to keep that to yourself, because a doctor
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:28.200]  will tell you that you're a schizophrenic.
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:34.400]  Modern psychiatry calls these voices auditory hallucinations, and even though a whopping
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:40.760]  one percent of the world's population suffers from schizophrenia, there isn't much research.
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:46.240]  But after 30 years of working closely with the criminally insane, Jerry Marzinski has
[1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:52.400]  noticed that the voices talking to these schizophrenics are all saying the same things.
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:55.640]  There is a distinct, predictable pattern.
[1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:01.920]  The voices are exclusively generating negative emotion, leaving the patient physically and
[1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:03.760]  emotionally drained.
[1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:09.320]  The voices are always pulling a person away from God or anything positive.
[1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:15.880]  The voices are always a call to action, instructing the person to either hurt themselves or hurt
[1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:22.800]  someone else, which is probably why the voices always rebel against the drugs that are prescribed
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:24.360]  for schizophrenia.
[1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:29.960]  These drugs make a person comatose, and the voices want you to do things.
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:35.400]  Marzinski believes that schizophrenics are being attacked by non-physical entities that
[1:03:35.400 --> 1:03:41.400]  he calls energy parasites, because they feed off of negative energy, and in practically
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:49.280]  every case, the victim has experienced severe trauma, usually sexual trauma, which explains
[1:03:49.280 --> 1:03:52.880]  why the voices tell people to traumatize others.
[1:03:52.880 --> 1:03:56.560]  These demons want more victims.
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:03.080]  According to the ancient Gnostics, who refer to these entities as Archons, they are destructive
[1:04:03.080 --> 1:04:09.160]  sadistic beings who control the earth via the thoughts of humans.
[1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:10.760]  Voices in the head.
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:16.560]  This explains the rampant pedophilia we are seeing today, and the incestuous inbreeding
[1:04:16.560 --> 1:04:18.480]  of royal bloodlines.
[1:04:18.480 --> 1:04:24.560]  These energy parasites need traumatized people to feed upon.
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:30.680]  Perhaps some of the thoughts in our own mind are not our own.
[1:04:30.680 --> 1:04:35.560]  Most schizophrenics claim that this is the case, but are told by doctors that they are
[1:04:35.560 --> 1:04:37.920]  crazy.
[1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:42.840]  Doctors who only give them lobotomies, electroshock, and drugs.
[1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:48.280]  And Marzinski has only seen schizophrenics recover once they start seeing these voices
[1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:50.240]  as an external entity.
[1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:55.960]  They then realize that they can actually resist them, and the voices go away.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.140]  Plus double patriot points on brain force, plus ultra 12, vitamin D3 gummies, ultimate
[1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:28.140]  krill oil, that's a huge deal.

[1:05:56.920 --> 1:05:59.080]  And don't forget Alex Jones' right t-shirt while you're there.
[1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:06.360]  It's hour number two and the main broadcast starts now!
[1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:11.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:22.440]  So yesterday at 4 a.m. Georgia time each time the Georgia
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:28.280]  guide stones got blown up a third of it gone and by the afternoon they had backhoes and bulldozers
[1:06:28.280 --> 1:06:35.080]  in there destroying the whole thing. A silver car was seen speeding away from the scene.
[1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:42.040]  A peaceful nonviolent way that didn't hurt anybody to expose this satanic global edifice,
[1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:48.920]  this obelisk, this marker for world government and extermination of seven billion people that
[1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:57.800]  it calls for. What a time to be alive but let's look at how they are actually targeting us right
[1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:04.200]  now and then we'll go to your phone calls. UN says a record 345 million people marching towards
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:11.960]  the break of starvation thanks to the lockdowns that they ran worldwide. Very important information
[1:07:11.960 --> 1:07:18.200]  that ties in to this chilling stack. We will never be fully vaccinated. Fortune.com.
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:25.160]  We will never be fully vaccinated. Told you two and a half years ago that was the case
[1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:31.320]  against COVID. We will never be fully vaccinated against COVID. Canadians must be required to
[1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:37.320]  get a booster shot every nine months. That was all the battle plans. They set it up front. It's
[1:07:37.320 --> 1:07:41.000]  not a vaccine. It erases your immune system and now they make you take something that gives you
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:50.200]  vades. Vaccine induced autoimmune deficiency disorder. Unbelievable. Just boom. That article
[1:07:50.200 --> 1:07:55.960]  alone could be a four hour show. Boom. Same thing being announced in Europe. Same thing in the UK.
[1:07:55.960 --> 1:08:02.120]  Same thing in Australia. Same thing in New Zealand. World government. England excess deaths on the
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:07.400]  rise but not because of COVID. We told you this a year ago. It's the vaccine. Particularly young
[1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:12.600]  people dying of heart attacks and blood clots and more and having autoimmune disorders.
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:19.560]  Twice as many vaccine deaths as COVID deaths in the U.S. households. Poll fines.
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:24.520]  Babies smothered in full face masks was full of joy claims photographer. You know they couldn't
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:30.520]  see the poor little child's face in its baby burka. Autism among American children and teens
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:35.640]  surges 50% in three years from 2017 with one in 30 kids diagnosed with a disorder by 2020
[1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:40.520]  study finds the mask killing is accelerating directly linked to the shots. Wall Street Journal
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:44.920]  Pfizer trial found vaccine toddlers were more likely to get severely ill with COVID more
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:50.440]  than twice as likely. Same numbers coming in worldwide. President Bolsonaro does the right
[1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:54.200]  thing. Is Trump an example of what to do? Says he regrets removing liability from
[1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:58.760]  pharmaceutical companies for vaccine side effects and is sorry for all the deaths.
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:05.080]  Some good news. Judge Knox down LA County School District vaccine mandate for five and
[1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:12.520]  ups to take the deadly experimental shot. Go to school. Winning noted COVID response critic
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:17.080]  former New York Times writer Alex Bernstein reinstated by Twitter following lawsuit.
[1:09:19.400 --> 1:09:26.200]  Being abortion. Try the COVID vaccine liberals. San Diego loses 22% of its police force due
[1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:33.000]  to Vax mandates. Fauci in I a ID spent nearly 500,000 turned monkeys transgender. What are
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:40.440]  they doing to us? And it goes on from there. That's the depopulation operation with them
[1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:47.160]  firing weapons and arresting people and shooting up tractors that protest in the Dutch
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:53.720]  countryside coming into the city in the Netherlands, saying we don't want our cows banned under
[1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:58.920]  carbon taxes announcing that nitrogen is a pollutant when nitrogen is incredibly life giving.
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:13.800]  is incredibly life giving. That's one of the stacks one of the stacks.
[1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:18.760]  Continuing with the economy.
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:27.080]  U.S. strategic oil reserves going abroad writers.
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.000]  They're sending upwards of a third of it to China.
[1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:37.720]  And India India is now the second biggest oil refiner in the world with Russian oil
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:41.720]  Russia's making record profits. All of it globalist to shut down America.
[1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:44.200]  U.S. strategic oil reserves going abroad Reuters.
[1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:49.640]  Goldman's the world is on the brink of a rather severe recession. Yeah, they call it
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:54.520]  a depression. The opening second by Tucker. We covered earlier. We didn't get to the last
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:58.520]  part we called for impeachment because Biden is purposely destroying America.
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:06.920]  Blaine, there's a major market shift going on that will trigger the end of the world.
[1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:10.280]  That's what big banks are saying. They're using terms like into the world.
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:15.800]  And it goes on from there.
[1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:21.720]  If you ever wonder about Elon Musk, I still think is an open question.
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:26.760]  None of these globalists now the new crop in the EU, none of them have children.
[1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:33.800]  Not McCron, not Merkel on any of them. But Elon Musk, we're learning has dozens and dozens and
[1:11:33.800 --> 1:11:39.400]  dozens of children. And basically is full time getting women pregnant because he says there's
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:44.600]  not enough humans. And he wants a human future, though some will merge with machines if they
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:50.680]  choose to. Elon Musk in the media is acting like, oh, we have drag queen pedophile time or you
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:56.120]  bring a toddler to men eating poop off the ground in Seattle at the pedophile pride parade. That's
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  good. But if Elon Musk has a consensual relationship when he broke up with his girlfriend a year ago
[1:12:02.680 --> 1:12:08.280]  and gets a female executive pregnant with twins, then Elon Musk is bad because he had sex with
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:14.840]  a woman who was consensual to have children. Oh my gosh, how horrible. Elon Musk quietly
[1:12:14.840 --> 1:12:22.680]  fathered twins with one of his executives last year. And it goes on from there.
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:31.960]  Now I mentioned this earlier, but I'm going to hit it again because it's so damn important.
[1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:42.440]  If we blame Boris Johnson and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and Angela Merkel and McCron
[1:12:42.440 --> 1:12:47.880]  and that idiot Trudeau and all these other people for the globalist attack, we're idiots.
[1:12:47.880 --> 1:12:55.160]  It's a worldwide corporate consorted UN destabilization collapse of world civilization
[1:12:55.160 --> 1:13:00.840]  program called the Great Reset to build back better on our ashes to destabilize and ban beef
[1:13:00.840 --> 1:13:06.280]  and banned chicken and banned cars for the average person. It's all been announced and they're doing
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:11.640]  it. You don't have to have Alex Jones make the Obama deception that predicts it all and shows
[1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:17.720]  you the documents. You don't have to watch in game now. You're living it. But if you see my films
[1:13:17.720 --> 1:13:23.800]  from 15 years ago and 10 years ago and it all comes true, do you understand when I get up here
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:29.320]  and tell you what's coming next? It may not happen on the date. I quadrant is probably when we'll
[1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:34.920]  see it happen, but it'll happen before or after that. You can bet your bottom stinking Federal
[1:13:34.920 --> 1:13:45.400]  Reserve note on it. So when we see headlines like this one about Boris Johnson resigning
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:51.880]  the lockdowns, the surveillance, the open borders, the control, this is a supposed
[1:13:51.880 --> 1:14:00.520]  conservative. Now they're lining up the communist wealth leader to come in and take over out of
[1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:07.000]  the fire into the furnace out of the furnace into the volcano out of the volcano into the sun
[1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:17.640]  out of the sun into hell. So there's hip hip hooray the piece of garbage that partied when
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:25.480]  everybody else was locked down is gone. Because the big crimes partying. But there's a fraud going on
[1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:32.600]  total distraction, a perfect example how they burn their fall guy, their scapegoat. He's been briefed
[1:14:32.600 --> 1:14:39.000]  on and he knows the whole plan. He'll be rehabilitated. He'll be politically resuscitated. He'll be
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:50.360]  rebuilt like Megatron from Unicron. Welcome Megatron. I am Unicron.
[1:14:56.040 --> 1:15:04.920]  You'll be given a new body and new troops to command. That's how they operate. That's what they do.
[1:15:04.920 --> 1:15:12.840]  We're going to break, come back with your calls. And we've got the DOJ suing so illegal aliens can
[1:15:12.840 --> 1:15:19.240]  vote in Arizona. Major NATO news, major Trump announcement news. I mean, Trump's now released
[1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:22.840]  his new presidential airplane with the American flag all over. They say the announcement's imminent.
[1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:29.320]  I told you, and I've talked to multiple Congress people. And you heard MTG yesterday said, oh,
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:34.200]  no, he's running. He says he's running. He's told her he's running. And he was set to announce
[1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:38.600]  this month. Was it going to be July 4th? Will it be next week? I don't know. But it's imminent,
[1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:45.640]  imminent, imminent, imminent, imminent, imminent. Infowars.com, Kamara's News Today,

[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:12.920]  around soon, then it will only get worse. But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare,

[1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:20.680]  caller a minute so we can get to everybody. I appreciate you all calling in on the Alex
[1:20:20.680 --> 1:20:24.600]  Jones show today. But my good friend, I think he's one of the best comics out there and he is one
[1:20:24.600 --> 1:20:29.800]  of the top 10 comics in the country now. Andrew Schultz said the courage to have me on his show
[1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:38.360]  several times and has also done pieces for us. He sold his comedy special to a very big unnamed
[1:20:38.360 --> 1:20:44.520]  outfit, Netflix is the word. And they didn't want the jokes you're about to see in it so he bought
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:48.280]  it back with his entire life savings. He's going to be putting it on the internet. But here's a
[1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:53.800]  few of the forbidden jokes. I just want to let y'all know right now, ladies, I am with you,
[1:20:53.800 --> 1:21:00.920]  I think is your body, your choice. I agree with you on that. I agree with you. When you say that
[1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:04.600]  men should have no say in the decisions you make with your bodies, those are your decisions to
[1:21:04.600 --> 1:21:10.040]  make and yours alone. And I feel that way because at the end of the day when we all go up to heaven
[1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:21.000]  and God's like, why are we all killing babies? We're going to be like y'all. I think they're
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:27.080]  very clear whose decision this one's got. Looks like you need to pay for your sins, babe.
[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:30.600]  Even though I paid for your sins.
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:39.160]  Come on, y'all. Shipper gave that to that baby as you know the rules.
[1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:43.800]  When I was living in my old place in New York, I lived down the block from an abortion clinic
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:52.920]  and location, location, location. And no bullshit. That's a wildest place in New York.
[1:21:52.920 --> 1:21:57.320]  Like it's a f***ing carnival outside of there every single day. Like people come to New York
[1:21:57.320 --> 1:22:01.240]  and they go to like Broadway plays and they literally spent thousands of dollars to watch
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:05.800]  Harry Potter to musical when they could just stand outside the clinic and watch something really
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:23.160]  disappear. Fetus the leaders. Fetus the leaders. So that is what they don't want you to see.
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:27.960]  They want to control everything. Ladies and gentlemen, they want to control your speech.
[1:22:27.960 --> 1:22:33.400]  They want to train you to submit to what they say. All right, we're going to take these calls in
[1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:39.160]  order. They received Chase, Craig, Alice, Jordan, Julio, Matt, Greg, Matthew, Jennifer, and Alex.
[1:22:39.800 --> 1:22:45.720]  Let's go to Chase in California. Chase, thanks for calling. You say 1984 to 1776.
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:50.280]  The guide stones. What's your view? Yeah, you know, you'll hear the slogan. The answer
[1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:57.560]  in 1984 to 1776. Well, there might be a new one. The answer to state memorandum 200 is Genesis 128.
[1:22:57.560 --> 1:23:03.960]  Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. This is the very first commandment that God gave
[1:23:03.960 --> 1:23:08.840]  the mankind. And it seems to be the exact opposite of the globalist plan. You mentioned
[1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:14.840]  for those that don't know, they say kill humanity down to 500 million and 90 plus percent reduction
[1:23:14.840 --> 1:23:19.960]  to Georgia guide stones. The UN officially that all of them say that. But Genesis says the opposite.
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:24.600]  You mentioned State Department memorandum 200. Henry Kissinger calling for global depopulation 1972.
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:30.680]  Exactly. I mean, this is something that they have put out there as their plan. And now the strange
[1:23:30.680 --> 1:23:35.240]  thing about what we're living, as you mentioned, is it's no more a plan. We're actually living it,
[1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:40.920]  but we can all take direct action to fight back. And that is to try to become a decent man and
[1:23:40.920 --> 1:23:46.840]  woman. I mean, nobody's perfect, but most importantly, become a great father or mother,
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:53.320]  raise a family, create a family. This is time travel. We just celebrated 4th of July. I was
[1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:58.280]  blessed to be able to hang out with my family. I see my brothers and their children. We're all,
[1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:04.040]  you know, just that is the way we're supposed to fight back is to be a human being, to go forth
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:09.320]  and multiply, to be fruitful, just like God wants. So we're all looking for a way to fight back.
[1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:12.120]  It's right there. The very first commandment God gave us.
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:15.880]  That's right. Most areas where humans are, it's better for the environment.
[1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:19.560]  We are making the earth better. The globalists are making it worse. Thank you so much for the
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:24.200]  call. Amazing points, Chase. All right, let's take another call. Craig in Ohio, you're on the air.
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:30.520]  Yeah, I have a proposed solution, but let me ask you in a nutshell, what do you think drives
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:35.880]  these globalists creating? They want to control life-sensitive technology. They want to use us
[1:24:35.880 --> 1:24:42.280]  as guinea pigs. They want to be God. Yep, exactly. So you asked, what are we willing to lay our
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:48.440]  life down for, right, for our brother? What are we really willing to sacrifice here? So let me
[1:24:48.440 --> 1:24:54.120]  just propose something here, right? You remember GameStop from a couple of years ago? I remember
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:25:01.640]  Jen Saki. GameStop. Yeah, your phone's a little, yeah, you don't speak your phone. Say it again.
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:07.480]  Yeah, do you remember GameStop? Man, your phone's breaking up. Remember what?
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:14.680]  Yeah, the whole GameStop situation, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So here's the thing. These guys are going
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.960]  to tank the markets on us when they're ready, right? So the key is we need to turn this around
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:23.560]  and tank it on them. That's what we have to be willing to sacrifice if we're not.
[1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:29.080]  Economic warfare is one of the best systems of civil disobedience. What target do you suggest?
[1:25:30.760 --> 1:25:34.760]  Well, can you give me a little more specific on that?
[1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:40.920]  You're saying GameStop's the way to take them down. I'm saying what target do you suggest is
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:45.560]  the next target to bring down the global? Well, it's the stock market, right? The stock market,
[1:25:45.560 --> 1:25:52.920]  the dollar index, right? The crude oil market, precious metals market, brain market, cattle
[1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:57.080]  market, they all need to come down, right? We need to take them down before they take them down on
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:01.480]  us, right? Yeah, but it's too general to say to take the whole market down. A lot of that stuff
[1:26:01.480 --> 1:26:05.240]  is real and good companies. We need to target certain companies, but I hear where you're going
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:09.240]  thanks for the call. Let's talk to Alice in Arkansas. Alice, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:26:09.240 --> 1:26:17.640]  Hello, Alex. I'm a teacher of the scriptures appointed by God's own hand for the end times,
[1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:20.840]  and I'm going to just tell you how I see it and how it's going to go down
[1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:26.520]  from what he has taught me according to scripture. We are the children Ephraim,
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:36.520]  the children of the promise, and when we put the abomination, which is multifaceted, the multifaceted
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:41.480]  abomination of desolation, which was the United Nations on American soil. God began to
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:50.440]  dismantle the United States. The multifaceted abomination is also the vaccine standing in
[1:26:50.440 --> 1:26:56.440]  the rebuilt temple, which is us, where it ought not, and that's because it changes our genetic
[1:26:56.440 --> 1:27:03.080]  sequence away from God. I'm nervous. They're doing a good job. So what else? All right.
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:08.440]  The blood moons have come and gone. The planets have all lined up. The age of Aquarius is the
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:13.480]  thousand year millennium when Jesus Christ is supposed to take his reign, and the people who
[1:27:13.480 --> 1:27:18.840]  have taken the vaccine and have that standing in our rebuilt temple need to repent before the
[1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:28.280]  first earthquake. In 1948, Israel flew its flag over its nation again, and that began the countdown
[1:27:28.280 --> 1:27:33.560]  of Daniel 70 years, which takes it to right at this time. Well, there's no doubt the mark of the
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:36.920]  beast is being announced. Prophecy is being fulfilled. The average church is not talking
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:41.560]  about it. Alice, amazing points. Thank you. Let's go to Jordan in New Jersey. Jordan,
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:48.360]  you're on the air. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. How are you? Good, brother. I'm glad you stayed on today.
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:53.240]  I know it's tough to stay in our father for you. I hope that that's a vibrator. I'm not trying to
[1:27:53.240 --> 1:27:58.280]  whine. It's just I get a certain sometimes I just lock up now. I'm like, it's really hard to like cover
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:01.400]  this stuff. I'm not complaining. I'm just I've got the point where I'm just like,
[1:28:03.480 --> 1:28:08.120]  you know, you're just a vessel, you know, for the message and the circuit, like I said, last time
[1:28:08.120 --> 1:28:14.840]  I spoke. So I know you got a lot of people and we got to move this. So I called Owen Troyer in May
[1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:23.000]  of 20, like I said, last May of 2021, May, you know, and I had gone through him, the things that
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.400]  I found out. I used to be an information scientist in the pharmaceutical industry. Jordan, I'll come

[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:00.280]  where are the clowns?
[1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:05.560]  Boris Johnson and Barack Obama and Joe Biden are just puppets of the globalists.
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:18.760]  They're all complete jokes. Maybe next year going to your phone calls Jordan restart what you were
[1:34:18.760 --> 1:34:24.120]  saying earlier it was important. Yes, thank you. Can you hear me all right? I can hear you loud and
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:29.960]  clear. Good. Okay, so first of all, I ask everybody to say a couple prayers for Dr.
[1:34:29.960 --> 1:34:35.000]  Carrie Maday, who was recently involved in a plane accident. I hope it's an accident.
[1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:44.120]  And I just want to use that as a foray into, you know, the injection. My family member got an
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:49.320]  injection and she was doing some research at the time. I had all this knowledge as a pharmaceutical,
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:55.480]  you know, basically an R&D person. And I went on, you know, and I called in in that May 2020.
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:35:00.040]  You told us you're going to know and you just tell us your views, our place.
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:07.400]  Yeah, no problem. So I told me to build a website. I'm very busy. This is one of the problems with
[1:35:07.400 --> 1:35:11.240]  everybody who has any clue what's going on. They're also just trying to pay bills, raise their kids,
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:17.400]  what have you. But there's no time left. And I want to just announce this site to everybody.
[1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:23.000]  I'm putting all my data and documents up there for everybody to view. That's online analysis.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:28.600]  It's in, you know, under construction, but it's called, you've been corona size. Okay.
[1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:43.480]  And it's at www.coronazed.com. Okay. And that site, there's something I have on their page
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:47.560]  with various categories, because this is very complex, called the corona matrix.
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:55.800]  And then in the one section called why COVID, I've started and I was only, I've started because it's
[1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.560]  so massive. And it took me a while to construct this on my own because I'm just doing this all by
[1:35:59.560 --> 1:36:06.520]  myself. But I've started to put all the white papers to support some of my analysis that you'll
[1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:11.080]  see at the beginning. I try not to do too much analysis. I try to just have people have a resource
[1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:15.000]  here so they can go through and learn what I've done. All right. So have your bottom line of what
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:21.560]  you found. Okay. So there's been a long history here in these vaccine programs of control.
[1:36:22.200 --> 1:36:31.000]  Okay. Jonas Salk said in survival of the wisest and state is very strongly. The man behind this
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:37.240]  wonderful polio vaccine, right? That, you know, it was an element of control. Now, if you try to buy
[1:36:37.240 --> 1:36:41.880]  survival of wisest on Amazon right now, you're going to be paying at least 900 to maybe 1500.
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.240]  Okay. And we know Salk was you, Jenna, said it's for depopulation control.
[1:36:45.240 --> 1:36:48.280]  Yeah. But cancer virus is in it. Yeah, that's on record. What so?
[1:36:48.280 --> 1:36:53.320]  Okay. Okay. So, but there's it as an aspect. You know that the entire placebo type system,
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:59.240]  double blind studies and all this stuff came out of all controversy in France of guess who was
[1:36:59.240 --> 1:37:05.800]  involved, Benjamin Franklin, right? Around 1784. There's a conference by the king regarding the
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:10.280]  the injection of magnetic people to check your side out, brother. I appreciate your call. I got
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:14.840]  to get to everybody else. But yeah, the whole history of vaccines and smallpox. I get it.
[1:37:14.840 --> 1:37:17.960]  People should check out the site. God bless you. Good job. We got to move quick.
[1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:20.760]  Did I promise you to all these calls? We just can't have callers on for five minutes,
[1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:23.480]  please. Julio in Colorado. Go ahead, Julio. You're on the air.
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:30.440]  Well, Alejandro, good to chat with you. As always, I escaped Illinois to come to northern Colorado.
[1:37:30.440 --> 1:37:36.680]  And I tell you what, there's a lot of open-minded info warriors out here in northern Colorado
[1:37:36.680 --> 1:37:42.280]  actually ran into someone at the really stampede, the old rodeo last weekend wearing an info war
[1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:48.280]  shirt. So it's good to see awakened minds across the country. Alex, as I mentioned last, I think
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:53.080]  it was last year or two weeks ago, and you're talking about it again today, it's quite clear
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:59.080]  more and more people that are awakening. You've got to steer them away from this left-right politics
[1:37:59.080 --> 1:38:04.280]  and steer them to who's really behind all the trouble with Bloomberg just earlier today,
[1:38:04.280 --> 1:38:10.120]  calling out the White House administration for their stupidity on oil prices and not answering
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:17.720]  them. Baron back in June wrote an article out according to data, you cannot blame gas station
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:22.280]  owners with contradicts. What? Sure. So the very globalists that set these policies are now blaming
[1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:27.960]  their puppet Biden. Bezos is doing it. Bloomberg's doing it. They're all doing it. Yeah, no doubt about
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:33.720]  it. And even going back to last November, Bloomberg talked about even sort of laying the
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:40.040]  foundation for the US selling its strategic oil reserve to China and to India. That was Bloomberg
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:45.960]  back in November of 21. So it's quite clear. They blame their minion, they blame their puppet,
[1:38:45.960 --> 1:38:50.120]  whether it's Boris Johnson or Biden for what they've done. I say burn Biden, burn
[1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:56.520]  Johnson politically, but just know they're the frontman. When you bust a soldier of the mafia
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:00.600]  committing a crime, you arrest them, but you also go after their boss. Julio, thank you so much for
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.800]  the call. Let's talk to Matt in Long Island. Matt, you're on the air. Go ahead. Yes, sir. How you
[1:39:05.800 --> 1:39:11.800]  doing? The truth still set us all free, everybody. That Oliver Cromwell was a sneaky bastard,
[1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:16.280]  developed the Freemasons to infiltrate the world, giving people the illusion of freedom,
[1:39:16.280 --> 1:39:21.720]  all the while doing the bidding of the royal family and snaring power hungry morons with
[1:39:21.720 --> 1:39:27.560]  rituals and lies, having them destroy their own people from within. George Washington's earliest
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:32.440]  ancestors included several members of the royal family. The most significant was King Charlemagne.
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:38.920]  He was also third cousin to Henry VIII. And let us not forget, he was a Freemason. I believe he
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:43.400]  was a plant from the royal family, giving us the illusion of freedom because the best warriors
[1:39:43.400 --> 1:39:48.040]  are free men. America was established primarily to bring the Northern Hemisphere to heal,
[1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:53.320]  mission accomplished. Now, the final piece is ready to be toppled. And yes, I mean America.
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:58.040]  I know it's hard to believe, but one must look at actions, not words, when dealing with demons.
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:03.880]  But luckily for us, we are free men. One must accept slavery because even if you are alone
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:10.600]  against the whole army, you do not have to accept bondage to charity. Fight no matter what, hold
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:15.080]  the Almighty in your heart for the righteous man is in the hands of God. So he is aware.
[1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:18.920]  Thank you so much. Thank you. Gary and Maine, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:26.520]  Okay, Alex, I got a three point plan that we can all do right now, starting today. And you
[1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:32.440]  don't have to do all three, but you should do at least one. First, point one, support the info
[1:40:32.440 --> 1:40:38.520]  war financially. X3 survival shield, the t-shirts, the stickers, wear them in public. I wore it at
[1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:45.720]  a fancy lobster bake in Kennebunkport on July 4th. Lots of response. Point two, on whatever
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:51.720]  social media platform you use, every time you see a globalist article, whether it's a coronavirus,
[1:40:51.720 --> 1:40:56.920]  climate lockdowns, attacks on conservatives, report it, report it for terrorism, report it
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:02.520]  from misleading, report it for spam, report it for every abuse they have listed and that is
[1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:08.520]  applicable. And finally, point three, find out who your local representative is on a state level,
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:15.080]  email them, write them, call them monthly, weekly, daily, respectively call on them to
[1:41:15.080 --> 1:41:20.040]  explain what they're doing to represent you and protect your freedoms on a local level,
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:24.840]  on a state level, and let them know how important it is to you that you vote and you'll be watching.
[1:41:24.840 --> 1:41:31.640]  And that's it. Beautifully said, amazing phone call. Gary, thank you. Matthew in Florida, you're on
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:42.040]  here. Good afternoon, Alex. I just wanted to drop my opinion on the guide stone. I don't
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:48.200]  necessarily disagree with your opinion, but I believe that this is one of the many ways that
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:57.960]  the cabal is trying to cover their tracks. In your 30-year tenure, you have gained so much
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:08.280]  viewership and following. And I do believe that we are actually winning the war, maybe not the
[1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:14.280]  battles, but we are winning the war. And we're getting a little close to the cabal. So if they
[1:42:14.280 --> 1:42:23.000]  are able to rewrite history in our education systems, then this would be an easy way for them
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:31.160]  to knock down a monument that shows what they're really trying to do. And then they can write it
[1:42:31.160 --> 1:42:36.360]  off just the way they write you off anytime and say, oh, well, it's crazy. No, I hear what you're
[1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:39.880]  saying. I mean, I don't know who blew up the Georgia guide stones. I mean, if they were there,
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:43.160]  we could keep exposing it, but it definitely brought a lot of attention to it. I don't know what
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:49.080]  happened to Georgia guide stones. 10 seconds left. What do you think happened? All right,
[1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:55.080]  right of time. Jennifer, Alex, Alex, Gus, Mark, Neil, your calls are straight ahead.
[1:42:58.200 --> 1:43:02.840]  The globalists are making their move. Their great reset is here. They're coming for your
[1:43:02.840 --> 1:43:07.880]  children. They're coming for the value of your currency. They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:13.960]  They're coming for your varied bodies with their biomedical tyranny. They're coming for your free
[1:43:13.960 --> 1:43:19.640]  speech. They're coming for your privacy. And ladies and gentlemen, they're coming for your
[1:43:19.640 --> 1:43:24.120]  right to vote and have your representative in government that you and your fellow Americans
[1:43:24.120 --> 1:43:29.800]  choose. The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view,

[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:32.200]  the same same um tactics that we've been trying right like i know that you know we're we're trying
[1:53:32.200 --> 1:53:37.560]  to buy supplements i mean i have a buddy that bought stuff from you too he rocks his 1776 sticker
[1:53:37.560 --> 1:53:43.000]  proudly um i just think we're not getting to enough people well bare minimum keep them for wars on
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.040]  the air and i agree with what you're saying but there's a lot more we should do we should have
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:50.520]  whole shows about how do we as activists i think everybody should talk at city council school boards
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:54.520]  it goes out it makes the news that's something where average people can do call and talk radio
[1:53:54.520 --> 1:54:00.760]  call to c-span march demonstrate i mean what else can we do alex i mean i see that you have a book
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:06.760]  coming out in august so hopefully that'll be an eye opener i mean alex i just think that the the
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:12.120]  new world order is in full effect and i think that we're just passively watching our life change
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:16.360]  no i totally agree and that's why i'm frustrated thank you alex let's talk to gusts in florida

[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:26.840]  wanted to call in and uh highlight something a previous caller said about when he said selling
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:32.600]  off all your stock and wall street and everything like that um it took my federal prison university
[1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:37.800]  education to teach me from a lot of wall street guys that the way the markets work you're not
[1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:43.080]  buying those stocks from from those companies though you're buying it from other bankers so we
[1:54:43.080 --> 1:54:49.320]  should take a tip from jesus and kick the money changers out the temple people should empty their
[1:54:49.320 --> 1:54:56.600]  401k dump it into their house lower your debt get the money changes out of your life because that
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:55:05.240]  seems to be the only constant now i hear you brother you know it's uh we need to make the
[1:55:05.240 --> 1:55:10.440]  little moves the little steps you know i've been approached by people out here who claim to be part
[1:55:10.440 --> 1:55:17.000]  of certain patriot groups and as a former fed i won't go near it because i know how the feds operate

[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:14.360]  collapse which we're already in then they'll get the blame you see how critical that is even though

[2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:12.680]  there's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on the show frequently he said me and hillary
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:19.160]  our demons said we smell like sulfur ain't that something i had never seen or smelled
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:23.800]  any woman like that ever people are telling me she smells who could not notice someone who smelled

[2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:44.440]  channel going donald trump really stepped in at this time he said it was a bombing before it had
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:56.280]  officially been called a bombing and hillary's on him and she's got some really good points
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:04.520]  the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:09.480]  chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that not because we're weak but
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:15.640]  because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful and the social engineers
[2:04:15.640 --> 2:04:21.080]  fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:29.960]  came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:35.000]  hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:42.280]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world
[2:04:42.280 --> 2:04:46.440]  who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air

[2:06:17.000 --> 2:06:21.480]  all you have to do is check out what i'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline against
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:29.480]  myself and tucker carlson everywhere every day jones admits he's an actor or tucker carlson says
[2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:36.360]  nobody would take me seriously where do we say that we never said that they just say we said that
[2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:43.560]  but where's the clip where's the article where do we say that doesn't exist alex jones is playing
[2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:50.360]  a character and is a performance artist jones is playing a character on his radio show the radio
[2:06:50.360 --> 2:06:57.800]  rants of alex jones are just an act he's actually a performance artist he's a performance artist
[2:06:57.800 --> 2:07:05.160]  alex jones is a fake they're lying to you because they think you're stupid and it's all based on
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:11.080]  custody battle max wife five years ago and she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed up
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:16.120]  more than a decade before like the joker being sarcastic saying take your pros act kids take
[2:07:16.120 --> 2:07:22.520]  your illegal drugs too you'll die it's fun so people wouldn't take drugs and they wanted
[2:07:22.520 --> 2:07:26.920]  to enter that in evidence they look he's insane telling kids to use drugs and my lawyer went
[2:07:26.920 --> 2:07:33.080]  when jack nicholson plays the part of the joker no one thinks that's really jack nicholson so yeah
[2:07:33.080 --> 2:07:40.760]  when i've been cobra commander or optimus prime auto bonds let's roll or the joker because i can
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:47.320]  do imitations of them all really good or darth vader don't act so surprised globalist you didn't
[2:07:47.320 --> 2:07:53.160]  think you could silence the american people did you do i really think i'm darth vader no
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:59.960]  do i think i'm optimus prime public commander the joker no and clearly no reasonable person
[2:07:59.960 --> 2:08:05.640]  would think when i'm doing satire that what i'm saying is what i really think no one believes
[2:08:05.640 --> 2:08:11.240]  the babel on b it's not trying to lie to you it's being sarcastic by the vaccinate meal modul
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:17.560]  today it's required by the cbc but they play those games and that's why i don't joke around as much
[2:08:17.560 --> 2:08:22.760]  as i used to even though i tell people okay this is a joke this isn't serious they clip it out
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:30.360]  and they say no this is what he really believes every day when i leave work i do this that man's
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:35.480]  address this country and they go look he admitted in court he's an actor well yeah i was an actor in
[2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:41.080]  scanner darkly i was an actor in waking life i was an actor when i was cobra commander
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:49.000]  but it doesn't mean that alex jones the talk show host up here reading news articles to you
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:54.200]  isn't a real thing and isn't something i'm actually saying and you know that you're insulted right now
[2:08:54.200 --> 2:09:02.120]  i'm even explaining that to you and so am i but that's who these people are you don't know the
[2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:09.800]  power of the dark side oh am i really darth vader i think alex jones seems really talented he's
[2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:24.680]  smart he's funny as hell it's truly funny i'm kind of retarded now that i've done those imitations
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:31.480]  those little jokes do you now not listen to what i say about other things when i show you a powerful
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:37.400]  news article by dr joseph mercola on info wars dot com it has all the side information the latest
[2:09:37.400 --> 2:09:44.360]  tragedy sudden adult death syndrome no that's a real thing that's something happening in the real
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:51.160]  world and that's what we're breaking down here today i am alex jones and i am the guy on this
[2:09:51.160 --> 2:09:57.320]  show every day i am an american and that's what i promote is freedom and justice and liberty and
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:08.680]  they can't stand it all right my friends i want to talk about solutions we're here to talk about them
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:13.400]  you know i was honest yesterday when the georgia guy stones got blown up and later in the afternoon
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:19.320]  demolished and i said i like seeing them gone the message to kill 90 percent of the world
[2:10:19.320 --> 2:10:24.360]  population put up by ted turner and others but i don't believe i'm going on private property i don't
[2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:30.680]  believe in blowing up monuments it was actually a monument exposing their evil this wasn't inside
[2:10:30.680 --> 2:10:36.520]  job we don't know did draw attention to the population agenda the critical time absolutely
[2:10:36.520 --> 2:10:45.720]  i'm not even judging who did it it was nonviolent but i know that if we just know the loopholes
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.360]  of the system and we know how they operate and we know their tricks then we can really beat them
[2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:55.400]  if you pay the minimum amount of federal income tax these people whether you're a small business or
[2:10:55.400 --> 2:10:59.400]  individual person or whether you're wealthy that defeats the new world order if you know the tricks
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:04.280]  they know they don't want you to know then that's how you level playing field because they'll get
[2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:11.560]  rid of the loopholes if we learn about them but in the interim we should do that so i've used
[2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:18.280]  toiler Bennett for tax advice he's done a great job he's a lawyer heads up a great group uh that is
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:24.360]  in los angeles and in los vegas with hundreds of employees cpa's lawyers you name it and this is not
[2:11:24.360 --> 2:11:28.440]  where you go to lawyers and they charge you a bunch of money and nothing happens and blah blah
[2:11:28.440 --> 2:11:33.720]  this is cut right to the chase they do an analysis and they have literally dozens and dozens of things
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:38.280]  they can do for you but i wanted to get him here because he's a smart guy i want his view on politics
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:43.640]  before we get into taxes and in ways to protect yourself and ways to set up corporations right
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:48.680]  to literally pay a fraction of these illegal taxes you should be paying so toiler Bennett of
[2:11:48.680 --> 2:11:54.760]  american tax solutions that sponsors us it's the same interface at jonestaxrelief.com we've
[2:11:54.760 --> 2:12:00.200]  gotten a way of reviews you know 99 percent have been great the few complaints we have we gave to
[2:12:00.200 --> 2:12:04.920]  you got right on it people really love what you're doing you cut right to the chase eight three three
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:10.760]  nine hundred four two eight five to call as well eight three three nine hundred four two eight
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:16.520]  five to call your folks and just hey do a presentation get a consultation do an analysis
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:21.640]  it's the smartest move you can make out there but tell them before we get into all that the ladies
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:27.720]  developments the irs and new rules and tyranny happening what is your view on biden selling
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:33.800]  the strategic oil reserves at cost to china and india while our gas prices go up what is your view
[2:12:33.800 --> 2:12:40.920]  of the raping of the border and the economy and the currency what is your view on the situation
[2:12:40.920 --> 2:12:47.880]  unfolding right now with just all of this tyranny out the open the georgia guide stones blown up
[2:12:47.880 --> 2:12:51.480]  what would you call this moment in history right now toiler Bennett well i would say
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:57.640]  not only is it very caught chaotic alex but it's also very scary because the globalists are out
[2:12:57.640 --> 2:13:02.920]  there and they know post pandemic and with this economic crisis we're facing and all the other
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:07.400]  power they have they have really stepped out into the open and kicked it into high gear
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:14.520]  into attacking the middle class attacking um you know the religious right and attacking the people
[2:13:14.520 --> 2:13:19.960]  at their very core that's right when we expose them and got balsun arrow and trump and orbonne
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:24.840]  and they just double down correct and they have the money and the resources to do that and that's
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:29.720]  like we say before there's always two systems right we can never be part of the globalist
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:33.880]  elite and there are ways you war against the grassroots system correct because that is the
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:39.640]  only thing that can even begin to defeat them like you said before if we pay these people
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:44.520]  we have to pay taxes but if we pay them the least amount of taxes possible then things like this
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:50.280]  don't happen what i have here is an article from forbes that says that tax revenues in the previous
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:57.160]  year have skyrocketed we are now paying as us citizens more an individual income tax you see
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:14:03.320]  how it skyrocketed right there in 2021 than any other year previous to that and that's partially
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:08.600]  due to an inflation but also this is because the u.s. government has plenty of stuff that it wants
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:14.920]  to spend money on that is not me not you none of the u.s. citizens here because we want to bail out
[2:14:15.880 --> 2:14:22.520]  russia and chinese interests right and so instead of helping the people here in our own country
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:28.680]  the government spending its money going more and more into debt to and what you said is key
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:32.840]  trump stood up to china and the globalist on one side of deals for four years they're now
[2:14:32.840 --> 2:14:37.160]  retroactively paying it back because they control china they're paying money back to themselves
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.760]  and hunter biden's laptop shows that that's not the only thing hunter biden's laptop shows too
[2:14:42.760 --> 2:14:47.560]  again he's part of the second group of people that the globalist that we are not part of
[2:14:47.560 --> 2:14:53.240]  and so unless that that laptop and those that tax evasion potentially and those
[2:14:54.200 --> 2:14:59.080]  under the table business dealings with bad people would have gone completely under the radar
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:06.120]  had it not been exposed and now the hunter biden team is of course trying to cover it up but
[2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:11.560]  the people know and we know that you know if you're not part of me and you and the regular
[2:15:11.560 --> 2:15:18.520]  u.s. citizen system but you're an elitist we know that there are two separate systems and
[2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:25.080]  the hunter biden example is a great example of that now another thing that hunter biden has done
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:33.960]  is try to use his own art to save develop billions of dollars in deductions that again
[2:15:33.960 --> 2:15:41.800]  are tied to the presidential regime so this is not only um illegal but also in proprietary
[2:15:41.800 --> 2:15:46.440]  and that it's connected to the president of the united states tyler bennett stay there we'll
[2:15:46.440 --> 2:15:50.440]  talk about this and more this is critical information i don't want you to know critical
[2:15:50.440 --> 2:15:58.840]  information they don't want you to know straight ahead stay with us there is nothing there is no
[2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:06.680]  more epitome of free speech than right here and that's what people recognize and resonate with
[2:16:07.400 --> 2:16:11.880]  and as word said you're not going to find a better place for information you might not agree with
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:15.800]  everything you might not agree with all our perspectives but we cover all the information
[2:16:16.440 --> 2:16:20.360]  and uh there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here thank you for that word info
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:24.920]  war store dot com by the way the products he mentions info war store dot com is where to get
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:30.040]  them folks and we do have the best supplements i mean just like we try our best with our news
[2:16:30.040 --> 2:16:36.920]  coverage and our information we do the best with our supplements as well i mean look at the hair
[2:16:36.920 --> 2:16:41.800]  and beard support formula folks this is a this is a joke i mean we're giving this thing away it's 75
[2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:46.760]  percent off by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula
[2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:54.600]  is working for me quite well i might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard
[2:16:54.600 --> 2:17:00.840]  support for men i go and see him quite often now the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:06.760]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the foods it's all come out
[2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:11.480]  and they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and
[2:17:11.480 --> 2:17:18.360]  we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous
[2:17:18.360 --> 2:17:25.800]  internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would
[2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:32.520]  not be necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:39.480]  and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in
[2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:44.360]  the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that
[2:17:44.360 --> 2:17:48.440]  everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even you don't believe in god

[2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:59.240]  for everybody this is so important for everybody to write down and to take action and to call
[2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:04.520]  that number a three three nine hundred four two eight five jonestaxrelief.com so Tyler Bennett
[2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:10.360]  the head of american tax relief that powers jonestaxrelief.com let's get into some of the latest
[2:21:10.360 --> 2:21:14.360]  developments of what's happening right now and the new tax rules that aren't law they don't want
[2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:20.840]  people to know about absolutely alex so right now one of the most important things to understand
[2:21:20.840 --> 2:21:28.040]  is how connected the irs which is the global collection agency and the top five banks that
[2:21:28.040 --> 2:21:34.840]  control the world the globalists if you will are connected because the when the irs says somebody
[2:21:34.840 --> 2:21:40.760]  owes money the banks are now their collection not they don't just report income like you we all know
[2:21:40.760 --> 2:21:45.720]  they do if you deposit over ten thousand dollars it's reported to the irs but they also collect
[2:21:45.720 --> 2:21:51.960]  against taxpayers for the irs and why this is important is we've talked about this before but
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:58.040]  this is chapter five of the internal just just a table of contents of chapter five internal
[2:21:58.040 --> 2:22:04.600]  revenue manual which is collections so everything in that is and it's a six page long table of
[2:22:04.600 --> 2:22:13.000]  contents probably a two thousand page document explaining all the terrible things that they
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  can do to you for example something we see all the time is let's say a taxpayer owes 15 20 thousand
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:26.840]  dollars to the irs what will happen is the bank will clear out their entire bank account and give
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:34.120]  it to the irs because the bank uses this the irm and not the actual law just like the clerks
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:39.000]  at the internal revenues just like we didn't send on all the carbon taxes and shut down the power
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:42.680]  plants but they're just doing it thank god the supreme court just said they got to stop that
[2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:48.680]  but then biden said we're not going to yeah it's it's it's absolutely like that so i mean the other
[2:22:48.680 --> 2:22:53.960]  the other thing too is they have the power to do certain things that are listed in this internal
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:23:01.160]  revenue manual but are on the face um would be a violation of your rights let me tell you a few
[2:23:01.160 --> 2:23:07.000]  of these there are what they call pre-assessment levies okay a levy is when they go in your bank
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:12.280]  account and take all the money out right and when they do even if you're even if you uh get it all
[2:23:12.280 --> 2:23:17.000]  back this is the type of situation where they don't pay you interest but they do charge you interest
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.440]  before they got it without getting into details this happened a year ago they're like yeah actually
[2:23:20.440 --> 2:23:24.200]  it looks like you did the right thing we're still holding it for a while correct which is holding
[2:23:24.200 --> 2:23:29.160]  this is happening that's right now yes so you're not law no judge no order just did it just did it
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:33.400]  and you're not going to get any interest back on it because that's the way it works is it's uh
[2:23:33.400 --> 2:23:38.440]  the system is for them and not another like well you actually are in the clear but we haven't gotten
[2:23:38.440 --> 2:23:43.720]  to the paperwork yet even though we might just close the operation right and no matter how long
[2:23:43.720 --> 2:23:49.000]  they hold it and even if it was vice versa let's say you did not give them that money it goes up
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:54.440]  that balance you owe every day compounded uh but not vice versa you're going to get back the same
[2:23:54.440 --> 2:23:58.920]  amount that they took from you even though it's worth way less with inflation that's right if they
[2:23:58.920 --> 2:24:04.680]  say they're right then you pay interest but if they're wrong you just get it back correct exactly
[2:24:04.680 --> 2:24:08.280]  it's i don't know what's that here is that happened a year ago we're still ongoing i mean that's
[2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:14.680]  that's just one of the crazy things going on it's it is and we can get money like this back for our
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:19.080]  clients um obviously want to do it as soon as possible because money's worth less and less and
[2:24:19.080 --> 2:24:23.480]  less every day and i just engage you two weeks gonna do that so that's happening right correct
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:29.400]  that and we we're working on that let me give you an example of an info wars listener um that last
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:36.120]  week we were able to do tremendous things for in the state of north carolina uh the irs had gone
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:42.840]  after um an info wars listener our client um against their business and they owed i don't
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:48.360]  know fifty sixty thousand dollars and the irs came in and levied their entire bank account which had
[2:24:48.360 --> 2:24:52.840]  close to eight hundred thousand dollars and they took every dime and this is when i talk about
[2:24:52.840 --> 2:24:58.680]  the banks because even the irs knows say that again yo sixty thousand under their fraudulent system
[2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.920]  they take eight hundred they take eight hundred they take it all and they cut you a check back for
[2:25:02.920 --> 2:25:08.280]  the difference with no interest uh after they decide to which could be months later right now
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:14.440]  there is uh the subreddit waiting almost a year yeah it's it's it's ridiculous that they they will
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:18.680]  do whatever they want to do but i was by desire us now it's remember when they admitted to obama
[2:25:18.680 --> 2:25:22.200]  they were targeting conservatives yes and now they're now they just straight up admit they're
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:30.920]  targeting christians so you know we go from bad to worse but here's the thing right is uh we flew
[2:25:30.920 --> 2:25:37.320]  out to north carolina we talked to that revenue officer and this is why the bank and their relationship
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:42.280]  is important because the irs even agreed that they would give that money back to the client however
[2:25:42.280 --> 2:25:47.480]  the bank tried to tell us no we're not giving it back even though the irs says we're going to give
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:53.240]  it back the bank said no no it's part of our policy we don't give it back which is a violation a gross
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:58.600]  violation of that info word listeners rights and that's why we were able to go back out there
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:26:02.840]  get a hold of the irs smack the bank down and get all that money back for the client and that's
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:08.760]  what you do that is exactly what we do you have hundreds of people yes hundreds of people and
[2:26:08.760 --> 2:26:15.480]  sometimes i will fly out there myself but i send my uh very very accomplished attorneys and cpa's to
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:20.440]  do a lot of this work and they did fantastic work in norway and when you know the law and the rules
[2:26:20.440 --> 2:26:26.360]  they just back down almost always yes so that's that's the crazy thing alex is the irs well if we
[2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:32.280]  come to them with attorneys and law and uh case law they back down pretty quickly in this situation
[2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:38.760]  it was the bank a third party organization that was collecting for the irs that was trying to tell us
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:43.640]  how to interpret the law again this is not a lawyer this is not even a clerk at the irs this
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:47.160]  is a bank manager doesn't have a lot of grief and that's what's scary about the global system it's
[2:26:47.160 --> 2:26:53.240]  involving the corporations in it yeah it's like on january 6 the next three days anyone that flew
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:59.800]  to dc they were blocking their flights and grabbing their bank accounts correct i mean yeah just because
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:04.760]  oh we see you flew here a lot of them just went there for business or to visit family because in

[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:24.680]  here's another example if you want to hold this up is so what the irs is doing as well
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:29.800]  because they're not just they're not satisfied with the banks as third party collection agencies
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:36.520]  they have used the biggest collection agencies in america conserve is one of them and there's two
[2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:43.560]  others and the idea is the irs instead of actually collecting against you will sell your debt your
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:48.760]  tax debt that you owe to the government to a private collection no judge no jury they sell it like
[2:27:48.760 --> 2:27:54.680]  debt servitude correct and in that private company that has no connection to the government at all
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:28:00.440]  is going to make a percentage last night i was watching frontier with my wife which is a you know
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:05.080]  a netflix show which is actually based in history and it showed the same thing when one of these
[2:28:05.080 --> 2:28:10.120]  corporations that ran the government said you owed no judge no jury they just came and took
[2:28:10.120 --> 2:28:15.880]  this woman's tavern they just took her stuff correct and and you don't in to have any due
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:21.880]  process at all your file has to be moved back from the collection agency to the irs and so

[2:34:04.040 --> 2:34:10.520]  two eight five titer bennett please continue all right alex so uh as you were just saying this is
[2:34:10.520 --> 2:34:17.000]  a great example of the two systems the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie the uh the globalists
[2:34:17.000 --> 2:34:22.520]  in that information right we all know it's an info war and it's just so much true when it comes to
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:29.000]  tax the irm the internal revenue code etc etc so something that all your listeners need to know
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  about because you have to take advantage of this in the next nine months is there was quick super
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:42.680]  quietly under the radar a tax relief uh initiative that went uh just a few months ago and passed
[2:34:42.680 --> 2:34:49.160]  congress and what it is is if you owe the irs up to fifty thousand dollars there are now
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:56.600]  now expedited ways to lower that as low as eight or five percent of what you owe as um
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:01.080]  you know for the pandemic relief is what they're calling it but here's the thing
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:06.200]  they never released any press releases or just only for the insiders right new york's times
[2:35:06.200 --> 2:35:11.080]  articles about this this was just so it's sixty thousand dollar bill goes down about six seven
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:18.840]  thousand correct so right now it's it's fifty thousand dollars or less could go down to five or six
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:23.240]  thousand and if you owe a little bit more than that we can always do a penalty abatement or pay a
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:29.720]  tiny bit so you fit that fraction because we'd rather pay them a tiny bit and get away with uh
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:35.560]  not paying the majority than vice versa now alex uh when we were talking last time we were talking
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:43.560]  about four extra judicial uh types of collection activity that the irs routinely uh in engages in
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:48.760]  the first one which you just spoke about is on the last break is the pre-assessment levy now
[2:35:48.760 --> 2:35:55.160]  that's when they come and take your car lock up your business uh try to foreclose on your house
[2:35:55.160 --> 2:36:01.160]  before they even know how much money you owe because they think that you owe a lot and now you have
[2:36:01.160 --> 2:36:09.720]  some experience with that um the other two or excuse that we haven't spoken about are just as
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:19.480]  terrifying so the irs has this concept they call a nominee and what that is is let's say i owe taxes
[2:36:19.480 --> 2:36:27.160]  but for some reason they think someone else in my family and my group of friends a business that i
[2:36:27.160 --> 2:36:35.320]  own um is in fact my tax debt and so without actually proving any legal argument they can
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:40.440]  attach a business's tax debt to my personal tax account and then i am in the position of
[2:36:40.440 --> 2:36:45.640]  having to make the legal argument that that is not the case and as you i'm sure you can just
[2:36:45.640 --> 2:36:52.760]  realize right now when you're fighting city hall and they come down and put a extra judicial
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:57.320]  judgment on you guilty until proven innocent exactly and then you're gonna and they're holding
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:37:03.000]  you hostage right they're holding you hostage and the average person let's say the the the irs
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:08.200]  loves going after the lower middle class even though there's tax cheats all over the spectrum
[2:37:08.200 --> 2:37:12.520]  they don't target they're really powerful you know they they don't it that the really powerful is
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:17.800]  political and then um right under that they can target those people and they do but it's heavy
[2:37:17.800 --> 2:37:23.560]  on their resources because they have lots of business businesses trust LLCs the kinds of
[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:28.360]  things that you can engage us to help you set up but we're when we're talking about little mom and
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.320]  pop shop garage sale didn't report six hundred dollars that's who they want to audit because
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:37.880]  that's easy pickings for them and they go for the low hanging take your house yeah and they can
[2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:42.440]  and they will and the thing is is as soon as you have good representation that cuts the chase
[2:37:42.440 --> 2:37:48.200]  it's bye bye we'll put the capuch to that real quick because like i said it's an extra judicial
[2:37:48.200 --> 2:37:55.000]  activity um it does mention it in the irm which is why these clerks not attorneys believe they can
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:01.640]  do it but once we get our attorneys on the case it goes away pretty quickly so this is happening
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:05.880]  to you don't let them take your property don't let them take your money let us protect you don't
[2:38:05.880 --> 2:38:11.240]  tax relief dot com or the phone number will put on screen so what's the other way they're grabbing
[2:38:11.240 --> 2:38:17.560]  stuff so here's here's that this one is has the name with it that's even insulting so what they call
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:24.840]  is irs courtesy collections just as a courtesy right and so what that means i don't call mugging
[2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:31.160]  courtesy or absolutely mugging basically what happens is let's say i owe a bunch of money to the irs
[2:38:31.160 --> 2:38:36.440]  and i can't pay him back so what the irs can do extra judicially mind you is what's called courtesy
[2:38:36.440 --> 2:38:43.400]  collections go to my daughter go to my employees go to my friends and collect that money through
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:48.200]  them because they don't think they could get it from me and if that doesn't just sound straight
[2:38:48.200 --> 2:38:53.240]  up illegal to you trust me it is it's extra judicial if that's happening to you or anyone you know
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:59.720]  we can give you help that is probably the most insulting one what's the most common they do most
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:03.560]  common is the first we talk about which is a pre-assessment levy which is where they just
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:08.120]  grab the money out of your bank account without even claiming how much you owe or saying we'll
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:13.880]  figure out how much you owe later and the problem with that is they can't legally take something
[2:39:13.880 --> 2:39:19.480]  from you without knowing what your tax debt is because until you file or until they file for you
[2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:25.960]  remember you don't actually have any tax debt until you file that's why the law is to file and
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:31.480]  when you don't file an accumulate tax debt it's not from not filing it's because the state filed
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:36.760]  for you and the IRS filed for you and of course when the IRS files for you you can owe a lot more
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:43.320]  taxes than you probably actually even would have had you taken no deductions incredible and again
[2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:48.840]  people don't know the loopholes now simple it is to use the system's own laws against them which
[2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:53.640]  they hope we people don't learn about that's exactly right Alex so all these things we just
[2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:59.480]  mentioned are deep in the IRM this is the what I just showed you that the table of contents that's
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:06.120]  just one chapter of the IRM and we'd have to go in deeply and find these so simple they call you
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:11.480]  they do an assessment and then you got to say we can do this for you X and then almost every case
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:17.480]  it saves massive massive money correct what happens is you got a tax issue you give us a call we
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:23.000]  will be able to diagnose and identify actually what's happening because of the way that these
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:28.040]  people take advantage of your rights you may know you owe taxes or may think something's the case but
[2:40:28.040 --> 2:40:32.840]  that doesn't necessarily mean that's what's going on so that's why so you guys demand due process
[2:40:32.840 --> 2:40:37.320]  and the real negotiation against absolutely we absolutely demand due process we absolutely
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:42.040]  will find out what the government is simple lawyers demand due process and a real real
[2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:46.360]  discussion happens that's correct but if you're not doing that you're being right exactly it's
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:52.200]  like going into a fight without arms exactly correct it's like going being you know it's like
[2:40:52.200 --> 2:40:58.120]  being in a hundred and three pound weight class and going against Mike Tyson we got a minute and a

[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:47.080]  they won't give you a good deal nothing's perfect in this world but the best group i found is
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:51.960]  american tax solutions at jones tax relief dot com and whether you're a blue collar worker or a
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:57.400]  farmer or a rancher or a business owner or a millionaire they can save you money using the
[2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:02.440]  system's own tactics against them you should go to jones tax relief dot com or a three three nine
[2:48:02.440 --> 2:48:07.240]  hundred four two eight five a three three nine hundred four two eight five and do a consultation
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:11.160]  the system doesn't want you to do this you can lead a horse to water you can't make a drink
[2:48:11.160 --> 2:48:17.080]  teller benna continue all right so let's start start talking about the states because the irs
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:22.840]  is bad but the states are not just as bad probably worse i've experienced it they're yeah
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:28.600]  they're horrible whatever they want exactly and so one thing that's probably affecting a lot of your
[2:48:28.600 --> 2:48:35.080]  audience right now truck drivers people who work in multiple states is what we call the residency
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:42.040]  crisis especially now post pandemic all the states unlike the feds who are posting record revenues
[2:48:42.040 --> 2:48:48.120]  the states are broke and need money and they're going to take it out on you faster than the irs
[2:48:48.120 --> 2:48:54.920]  well and so the something that comes up a lot is multiple states claiming that you worked in that
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.480]  state therefore you owe taxes in that state even though you might be a resident you might live
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:05.880]  in a different state for example let's say you live in alabama but you drove a truck to california
[2:49:05.880 --> 2:49:12.040]  and so california is now saying uh you owe taxes in that state as well and so california in
[2:49:12.040 --> 2:49:16.920]  is actually one of the bad ones as well as new york and pennsylvania are the most aggressive
[2:49:16.920 --> 2:49:23.080]  about taxing people that aren't even residents of their state because of they did business there
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:30.440]  now uh there's a lawsuit in pennsylvania that uh the taxpayers are suing uh the state over this
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:34.760]  and this is likely to go to the supreme court but until then these states are able to get away
[2:49:34.760 --> 2:49:41.640]  with this kind of thing however if a state is if a state you don't live in and didn't spend half of
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:47.240]  the year in is trying to claim that you owe them taxes fraud that is wrong it's not legal give me
[2:49:47.240 --> 2:49:52.680]  a call we will we will show them your driver's license and now and again the supreme court
[2:49:52.680 --> 2:49:56.280]  last week i love their rulings and sometimes i'm upset with them i'm not saying they're gonna
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:02.120]  save us but they said listen all these federal bureaucracies are banning cows banning pigs
[2:50:02.120 --> 2:50:08.520]  chickens gas oil stoves people if you don't live in a state that's doing this you're lucky like
[2:50:08.520 --> 2:50:14.680]  texas or south dakota or florida it's going on like in 30 states right now plus and the supreme
[2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:19.720]  court said you can't just make law on these bureaucracies but that's what the irs the epa
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:25.240]  the fda like like like the uh food recommendation just said we don't even follow the federal law
[2:50:25.240 --> 2:50:29.560]  on testing now we're gonna make you take an experimental shot they're out of control this
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:37.480]  is bureaucratic madness correct and the states like to make their own laws uh irregardless to
[2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:43.640]  the supremacy clause of the u.s constitution which says federal law preempts uh all state law
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:49.640]  and so the states will actually make illegal laws unconstitutional it's like a record skipping
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:55.880]  or a car wreck sound when you guys come in they immediately stop absolutely i can tell you there
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:51:02.520]  is one instance that we are dealing with and this here is so this a little bit political uh the
[2:51:02.520 --> 2:51:09.560]  the wisconsin attorney general's race has come down a lot to you know roe v wade but also those
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:14.200]  people that want to kill babies are the same people that do not want you and me to have
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:20.120]  a representation before the irs the state of wisconsin the attorney general is saying
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:27.240]  that they are not going to allow anybody except those people who are uh wisconsin residents
[2:51:27.240 --> 2:51:32.360]  and have a license from wisconsin to represent somebody not in front of the state of wisconsin in
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:38.920]  front of the irs okay but the irs is already determined that to practice in front of them
[2:51:38.920 --> 2:51:45.320]  you have certain laws and certain uh certifications to receive federally the states cannot do this
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:51.800]  so right now they are personally attacking if you live in wisconsin right now this is a personal
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:56.680]  attack against you because they do not want you to be represented against your tax debt
[2:51:56.680 --> 2:52:03.000]  both federally and state and and it's this is one of those instances where the supremacy clause
[2:52:03.000 --> 2:52:09.000]  clearly would uh makes this unconstitutional but the state is what happens if you guys get involved
[2:52:09.000 --> 2:52:15.480]  they move on to easier targets that is correct because like i said the state just like the irs
[2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:22.360]  the thing there they're bullies and what is the bully interested in the easy target the low hanging
[2:52:22.360 --> 2:52:28.280]  fruit as soon as as soon as some uh representation gets into the field well now they realize they
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:32.440]  got to pull up their pants and get to work and they don't like to do that but we make them do it
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:38.520]  we've got like six minutes left what other key points you want to add about jonestaxrelief.com
[2:52:38.520 --> 2:52:45.080]  well sure here so i just want to say for jonestaxrelief.com we have you covered from the past the
[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:50.120]  present and the future and i've said that before but if you forgot what it means the past is you
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:54.840]  already owe money they're coming after you they're doing some of that nasty collection activity we
[2:52:54.840 --> 2:53:00.680]  just talked about we can give you some help we'll stop it we'll stop them in their tracks if you are
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:06.040]  hey realized you didn't file taxes for this year and you're like well i'm gonna owe money if i don't
[2:53:06.040 --> 2:53:11.000]  take care of that give us a call we will make sure that those taxes get filed and those penalties
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:16.520]  and interests are minimized or negated completely and then we have the future right this is everybody
[2:53:16.520 --> 2:53:23.480]  out there who's making too much money or paying too much in taxes i should say and want to keep more
[2:53:23.480 --> 2:53:29.080]  of their hard-earned money and because of the way you're set up you're getting pushed into a higher
[2:53:29.080 --> 2:53:32.920]  tax there are simple strategies by law they set up for themselves they don't want you know about
[2:53:32.920 --> 2:53:37.080]  correct and what we're talking about is corporations and we're talking about trust
[2:53:37.080 --> 2:53:45.160]  instruments irrevocable trusts and corporations are the two biggest conduits that the globalists
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:52.440]  and the elitists use to pay the smallest amount of income tax possible a fraction of what you and i pay
[2:53:54.520 --> 2:54:00.440]  in other big irs news they're saying 600 bucks and they're surveilling everybody without warrants
[2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:05.480]  i mean what is biden's announcement of going after blue collar and lower middle class people
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:13.160]  what does that signify again alex this is this is it's it's really offensive to me working in the
[2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:19.240]  industry but this is another example of the irs has more money this year than they've had before
[2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:26.120]  the irs has more people than they've had before but instead of going after those people on top
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:32.760]  that are for you know we talk about the tax gap these are the the people on top uh the zuckerberg
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:39.000]  ain't almost no tax hey nothing in tax and if they paid their fair share the um it wouldn't
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:42.200]  even be the very globalist talk about that all day in the news that they're about to do it they
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:48.440]  never do it correct and so what the irs is planned to to get rid of the tax gap the deficit is not
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:53.400]  to go after those people but it's to go after the mom and pop shops the lower middle class uh
[2:54:53.400 --> 2:54:57.400]  they just passed that law saying if you sold something at a garage still for over 600 bucks
[2:54:57.400 --> 2:55:01.240]  you better you better 109 and if you don't know your rights you are going to be screwed
[2:55:01.240 --> 2:55:07.960]  blue to tattoo absolutely and listen again when they're targeting the lower middle class specifically
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:13.720]  that's when we got to make sure you're you're protected and taken care of because like i said
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:21.320]  it what this is about is the irs um you doing bully like maneuvers and people just rolling over
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:27.240]  when i've learned about good tax lawyers and you guys is cpas won't go to bat for you they just
[2:55:27.240 --> 2:55:31.720]  follow irs rules of the law when you guys certify and sign off on something you're standing there
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:39.000]  to protect them that's right so the the difference is a regular cpa firm they work uh with the irm
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:44.440]  in the irs and irc and they're trying to just make sure that they don't care how much you pay in
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:49.080]  taxes they're just trying to make sure their work doesn't get audited right and so yeah you have a
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:55.640]  good tax return but what they're not is advocates what we do is we say hey we understand that the
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:00.760]  irm and certain provisions of the irc are saying you owe this amount of money but we can look up
[2:56:00.760 --> 2:56:06.680]  other provisions and find out deductions and loopholes to get you out of the majority of what you
[2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:13.320]  owe jones tax relief dot com or call the toll free number it's such a simple thing that's why i can
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:17.480]  promote supplements this hour which are great for our bodies while i promote them books films
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:21.400]  wake people up fight the globalists those are all important but that's why i'm so behind what you
[2:56:21.400 --> 2:56:25.320]  guys are doing not to share great sponsor any sponsor i bring has got to have great results
[2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:29.720]  and it's nothing is a silver bullet nothing's perfect but people not knowing this not having
[2:56:29.720 --> 2:56:35.160]  advice is insane it's like driving a car wearing a blindfold people should call you guys today
[2:56:35.160 --> 2:56:41.160]  that's absolutely correct alex since everybody here went to school high school college you
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:45.640]  learn next to nothing about taxes and that is by design so they can take advantage of you
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:52.120]  listen me and my team that's exactly what we studied the last 10 20 years and so and
[2:56:52.760 --> 2:56:58.040]  that's exactly what we do and we know that those tax laws change every year so that
[2:56:58.040 --> 2:57:03.720]  that the globalists can remain one step ahead of everybody else but we follow those changes
[2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:08.840]  and we know what entities to put you in and so that you can save the most amount of money
[2:57:08.840 --> 2:57:12.600]  and you're getting a lot of calls so be patient they'll call you back sometime the same day so
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:16.840]  those two days we're getting the only complaints we get is it was great once they got the call
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:20.840]  but they took a few days you're sometimes you get overwhelmed it comes in fits and spurts

[2:59:55.400 --> 3:00:02.600]  the joe biden presidency is to humiliate the rest of us and think less of our own country
[3:00:02.600 --> 3:00:07.800]  the place where we were born you can just imagine barack obama and susan rice and ron claim people
[3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:12.440]  who truly dislike the united states as currently constituted saying let's make this guy president
[3:00:12.440 --> 3:00:17.720]  that'll grind it in her face a guy who can barely talk so it's hard to hear anything joe biden says
[3:00:17.720 --> 3:00:22.200]  because it's hard for him to say anything but if you listen carefully or read a transcript you will
[3:00:22.200 --> 3:00:29.960]  learn what he just said is we're releasing a million barrels per day for a total of more than 180
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:34.360]  million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve than caverns in a couple of states
[3:00:34.360 --> 3:00:40.120]  how much is that it's a staggering figure so let's be context the reserve can hold more than 700
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:44.600]  million barrels total but it didn't have that because congress by the way as you haven't been
[3:00:44.600 --> 3:00:52.280]  paying attention has been selling off our strategic petroleum reserve to pay off debt
[3:00:53.320 --> 3:00:59.080]  so by the time joe biden arrived there was far less than that there was about 568 million barrels
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:04.840]  of oil in the strategic petroleum reserve now no president in american history has ordered a drawdown
[3:01:04.840 --> 3:01:10.040]  this large in 1991 the beginning of operation desert storm which is an actual war with real
[3:01:10.040 --> 3:01:14.600]  american soldiers involved the u.s. government released 17 million barrels of oil as a way of
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.720]  assuring a stable supply of global crude the u.s. released just 20 million barrels after hurricane
[3:01:19.720 --> 3:01:25.080]  katrina destroyed parts of the gulf coast where so many refineries are but now we're releasing many
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:31.080]  times that figure from the reserve all to protect the democratic party from getting what it deserves
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:37.640]  in the midterm elections in november and as a result of that unbelievably reckless in fact
[3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:42.440]  criminal decision our strategic oil reserves are at their lowest level in nearly 40 years and they
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:47.960]  are dropping fast again none of this needed to happen there was no reason to tap our strategic
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:52.600]  petroleum reserve when we could produce the energy here and we're in fact producing until joe biden
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:58.280]  took office but at the same time you have to be honest principles of supply and demand would
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:03.560]  suggest that this would work in the short term releasing all this oil should have lowered gas
[3:02:03.560 --> 3:02:09.000]  prices until the reserve ran out which it will to inject more petroleum into the market and
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:15.080]  prices for gas should drop but here's the amazing thing that's not happening since joe biden started
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:21.320]  releasing all this oil from our reserves which he does not own you do we do what has happened to gas
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:28.040]  prices they haven't dropped they've kept going up huh in mid-june the price of both regular
[3:02:28.040 --> 3:02:33.080]  unleaded and diesel critically hit all-time highs well over five bucks a gallon nationally how could
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:39.160]  this be it really was a mystery it violated the most basic rules of economics but now thanks to
[3:02:39.160 --> 3:02:46.760]  new report in Reuters we know why it turns out the oil being released isn't for us it's going to
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:52.760]  india and china according to Reuters and we're quoting more than five million barrels of oil
[3:02:52.760 --> 3:02:58.680]  that were part of a historic us emergency reserve release to lower domestic fuel prices were exported
[3:02:58.680 --> 3:03:06.920]  to europe and asia last month the piece continues quote cargo of spr crude oil from our reserves
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:11.800]  were also headed to the netherlands into a reliance refinery in india an industry source said
[3:03:12.360 --> 3:03:20.920]  a third cargo bucklery seatbelt headed to china to china so as gas prices set records in this
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:26.440]  country as american citizens were born here and vote and pay taxes cannot afford to fuel their
[3:03:26.440 --> 3:03:33.400]  own cars the biden administration is selling off our emergency oil reserves to china
[3:03:36.200 --> 3:03:40.760]  that's not an indictable offense it's certainly an impeachable one and they should impeach him for
[3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:46.920]  that well they're gonna sell the redwood for us to china next how about the water rights to the
[3:03:46.920 --> 3:03:52.200]  great lakes that's the equivalent of what he just did now if you're keeping track they didn't even need
[3:03:52.200 --> 3:03:57.480]  it china and india already have access to very cheap oil from russia why thanks to the biden
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:01.720]  administration's a lunatic ban on russian oil imports for moral reasons there's a moral victory
[3:04:01.720 --> 3:04:06.360]  the people of ukraine remember that zolensky he was george washington said george w bush who wouldn't
[3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:11.480]  know george washington if he got in the shower with him according to customs data china spent
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:15.960]  19 billion dollars on russia oil gas and coal earlier this year that's double the amount they
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:20.440]  spent over the same period last year india spent five billion on russian oil that's a five times
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:24.760]  from what they spent a year ago so we just made russia a ton of money that's where the ruble is so
[3:04:24.760 --> 3:04:30.040]  strong as the dollar's getting weaker russia is raked in 13 billion dollars in additional revenue
[3:04:30.040 --> 3:04:35.000]  from india and china compared to the same period last year following all this this how we're punishing
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:43.880]  our enemies by selling off our own most valuable assets and watching russia and india and my god
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:50.040]  china get richer now on top of all of that cheap russian oil china is getting petroleum from our
[3:04:50.040 --> 3:04:54.360]  emergency petroleum reserves the crude by the way in the spr is the best crew that we have it's called
[3:04:54.360 --> 3:05:01.400]  medium sour crude i don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer
[3:05:01.400 --> 3:05:06.440]  a rancher a doctor a lawyer or a millionaire fortune and money magazine have all done these
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:11.400]  profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30 different answers 50 different tax
[3:05:11.400 --> 3:05:17.160]  returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over especially the big firms
[3:05:17.160 --> 3:05:21.880]  and the big tax groups because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:26.920]  understanding this and knowing this show it's a very important situation with inflation and all
[3:05:26.920 --> 3:05:33.560]  the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax wise it's legal and lawful that
[3:05:33.560 --> 3:05:37.960]  allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here if i hadn't gotten great tax advice
[3:05:37.960 --> 3:05:45.160]  in the last few years the only way you fail is not writing down the url jonestaxrelief.com
[3:05:45.160 --> 3:05:53.640]  one word jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285 833-904-285
[3:06:15.160 --> 3:06:28.680]  July the 7th 2022 and of course the big news here in the united kingdom despite the fact that it
[3:06:28.680 --> 3:06:35.320]  basically has no impact no relevance on the future of the country either way is the resignation of
[3:06:35.320 --> 3:06:40.760]  prime minister Boris Johnson and for our american listeners and viewers you probably don't know the
[3:06:40.760 --> 3:06:47.320]  exact reason why he resigned because it's not really a centerpiece of the issue the whole debate in
[3:06:47.320 --> 3:06:52.760]  the united kingdom right now is okay he's resigned is he going to leave immediately who's going to be
[3:06:52.760 --> 3:06:59.080]  the prime minister in the short term until the conservative party holds a new leadership election
[3:06:59.080 --> 3:07:04.120]  who is the next prime minister going to be after that that's what they're talking about what they're
[3:07:04.120 --> 3:07:09.640]  not talking about is the reason that he left okay Boris Johnson came to power on a raft of
[3:07:09.640 --> 3:07:15.560]  promises that were all broken he's completely abandoned his principles down the line on every
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:22.040]  single issue was he forced to resign because he signed up the united kingdom to follow this
[3:07:22.040 --> 3:07:27.640]  disastrous great reset green agenda that's already bankrupting other countries that's
[3:07:27.640 --> 3:07:33.560]  causing riots and mass demonstrations in italy in germany and specifically right now in the
[3:07:33.560 --> 3:07:39.560]  netherlands was he forced to resign because he basically had his wife in there kary johnson this
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:46.440]  big eco mentalist running that portion of the government signing is up to all this great reset
[3:07:46.440 --> 3:07:52.600]  world economic forum crap that's going to bankrupt our nation no he didn't wasn't forced to resign
[3:07:52.600 --> 3:07:59.800]  for that was he forced to resign because our borders are like sips completely broken down we've got
[3:07:59.800 --> 3:08:04.840]  what now experts are saying potentially a hundred thousand illegal boat migrants arriving by the
[3:08:04.840 --> 3:08:10.200]  end of the year they continue to flood into the country by their hundreds on a daily basis
[3:08:10.200 --> 3:08:15.880]  what does Boris Johnson's government do gives them a red carpet service gives them free hotel rooms
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:23.720]  at taxpayer expense plans to put 1500 young migrant men in little villages of 700 residents
[3:08:23.720 --> 3:08:31.000]  like linton on news was he forced to resign for that now was he forced to resign for implementing
[3:08:31.000 --> 3:08:38.200]  the disastrous damaging policy of lockdown despite the fact that before it was implemented and as a
[3:08:38.200 --> 3:08:43.960]  certain amount of other countries a few other countries in europe sweden and syria refused to
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:49.960]  implement lockdowns ended up having a lower mortality rate than the united kingdom johnson
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:57.640]  johnson was set to resist the pressure to impose that draconian abhorrent brutalist lockdown
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:02.120]  on the united kingdom which has all the studies have proven since was the completely incorrect
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:09.480]  decision he went ahead and imposed it anyway was he forced to resign for the outrage of lockdown
[3:09:09.480 --> 3:09:20.200]  now he was forced to resign because he didn't respond properly to a gay man groping somebody in
[3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:25.080]  a nightclub that's literally the reason why borris johnson has been forced to resign
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:33.800]  headliner of bbc chris pincher suspended this is from five days ago as tori mp after groping
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:41.480]  allegation okay so this conservative party mp part the same party as borris johnson was in a
[3:09:41.480 --> 3:09:50.280]  nightclub in central london quote extremely drunk on wednesday night last week and he groped two
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:57.480]  male guests while being extremely drunk at this nightclub this gay tori mp borris johnson has been
[3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:04.520]  forced to resign because he didn't respond properly to a gay man groping two other men in a late
[3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:11.320]  nightclub when he was pissed off his face that's literally the reason he's gone absolutely incredible
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:17.880]  no one's talking about that though apparently that's a big outrage oh my god offended people
[3:10:17.880 --> 3:10:23.640]  are so offended over that it's literally nothing obviously it's an unpleasant experience for the
[3:10:23.640 --> 3:10:33.560]  victims but that's why the prime minister's left office clown country clown world remix news reports
[3:10:33.560 --> 3:10:40.440]  who are the favorites to succeed borris johnson and you've got this raft of outpouring of glee
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:46.840]  and celebration and gusto from the left in the united kingdom who actually believe that borris
[3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:54.600]  johnson was overseeing a quote at best right wing administration and at worst fascist government
[3:10:54.600 --> 3:11:02.280]  in the united kingdom they think they've basically toppled Mussolini the guy opened the borders up
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:08.600]  to a degree that we've got hundred thousand illegal boat migrants just sailing right on in and being
[3:11:08.600 --> 3:11:14.680]  rescued by our own government apparently that's right wing to do that it's right wing to sign up
[3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:22.600]  to all the great reset zero carbon green agenda cuts that the world economic forum is pushing on
[3:11:22.600 --> 3:11:28.840]  europe it's conservative to mess up brexit and not actually be able to extricate yourself from the
[3:11:28.840 --> 3:11:35.000]  european court of human rights which is why their policy of deporting illegal immigrants to rwanda
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:40.360]  completely failed because we were still subject to that court but they think they've toppled Mussolini
[3:11:40.360 --> 3:11:46.760]  or hitler in reality the country isn't going to move in either direction to any degree it's a
[3:11:46.760 --> 3:11:53.240]  childlike understanding of politics of the system in britain itself to think that getting rid of
[3:11:53.240 --> 3:11:59.560]  borris johnson is going to shift the needle to any degree one way or another because look at the
[3:11:59.560 --> 3:12:06.120]  people who are favorites to succeed him headline remix news who are the favorites to succeed borris
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:13.160]  johnson one of them the favorite in fact is ben wallace the former soldier in the british army
[3:12:13.160 --> 3:12:19.880]  who voted against brexit he's a remainder he's a globalist he's a deep stator let's go to this video
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:26.520]  now though of nigel frage he did an interview about borris johnson with gb news talking about this a
[3:12:26.520 --> 3:12:32.040]  couple of hours ago here is nigel frage in the ends what we talk about this there's a lot of people
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:35.720]  who still like borris but there are a lot of people who feel he's done quite a lot of damage to the
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:40.680]  conservative party in its brand oh i think that's right and i think that's why this had to happen
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:46.360]  i think in a number one trust integrity decency truthfulness that's big but also on the policies
[3:12:46.360 --> 3:12:54.280]  which is the thing that really upsets me they've gone so far away high taxes big state immigration
[3:12:54.280 --> 3:12:57.880]  running at record levels i mean there's a list as long as your arm of things they've done that just
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.320]  aren't consistent with what people expected i heard what steve said there was no humility in the
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:08.120]  speech at all just for her these idiots the eccentric decision yeah yeah they all turned
[3:13:08.120 --> 3:13:13.480]  against me they're all fools and he sort of trumpeted at what he saw as he saw his achievements
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:19.000]  do you know what i just feel and i'd be more critical of him yeah almost anybody he's a load of
[3:13:19.000 --> 3:13:23.240]  valedictives but you know what you know what don't kick him out when he's down he's at a pretty rough
[3:13:23.240 --> 3:13:27.880]  day and well isn't that the thing you know i always think about borsch on this is a man when asked
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:32.600]  well why he left jones and get the politics he said well jones don't have statues built to him
[3:13:33.720 --> 3:13:38.760]  i remember a party conference last year people were talking about this being the johnson decades
[3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:42.840]  you know this was a man that was going to win he did biggest majority since that from the 80s
[3:13:42.840 --> 3:13:47.080]  for the conservatives he was going to win the next election we had to get used to johnsonism
[3:13:47.080 --> 3:13:52.200]  and yet here we are today where he's going to struggle to beat treason a's tenure you know he
[3:13:52.200 --> 3:13:56.840]  could have been a callahan a barn yes a second rate let's be honest about a second rate prime
[3:13:56.840 --> 3:14:02.520]  minister yes it's a great prime minister but in terms of history yeah all right you know i could
[3:14:02.520 --> 3:14:07.160]  say look he joined the brexit campaign at five minutes to midnight i could but he did join the
[3:14:07.160 --> 3:14:13.080]  brexit campaign and it was important that he did and somebody had to cut the gaudium not in 2019
[3:14:13.080 --> 3:14:18.200]  and johnson did that and nobody can take that away from him as i say i've felt for months he ought to
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:23.560]  go i felt for months he was taking the party towards an electoral cliff edge yeah at the next
[3:14:23.560 --> 3:14:28.360]  election but on a day like today i think let him have his moment i'm not going to kick him whilst
[3:14:28.360 --> 3:14:34.440]  he's down there will be friction next week there'll be more calls from the majors and people like that
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:41.240]  for him not to have this 10 week period i suspect ultimately the party probably will let him have
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:46.440]  it and just very finely you know the elections less than two years away the polls aren't that bad
[3:14:46.440 --> 3:14:51.320]  for the conservative party but the economy's going to get a lot worse let's be frank about that yes
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:55.000]  do you think the conservatives could still i mean it would be unprecedented i think you know
[3:14:55.000 --> 3:15:00.600]  then to win a what would be 50 only if it would be a fifth term only if they learn the lesson of
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:05.400]  brexit which isn't just about leaving the EU it's about completely changing the shape of British
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:11.240]  politics it needs radical reform and change it needs a house of laws that's got rid of an electoral
[3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:15.720]  system that has a degree of proportionality a postal vote system is cleaned up bring back
[3:15:15.720 --> 3:15:21.880]  trust into the whole system and maybe even a mechanism by which people call referendums on
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:27.720]  big issues if they wanted to if they did that and became the party of radical reforming change

[3:20:02.360 --> 3:20:17.000]  live from london england it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:26.040]  well as we covered earlier in the broadcast it has been revealed that the biden administration
[3:20:26.040 --> 3:20:33.640]  said five million barrels of oil that were part of a historic usspr release to europe to asia to
[3:20:33.640 --> 3:20:39.400]  basically enemies of america like china even as americans struggle of course with the chronic cost
[3:20:39.400 --> 3:20:46.040]  of living crisis which europeans are also struggling with and sky high gas prices so they're sending
[3:20:46.040 --> 3:20:52.040]  the oil to china in europe now we have the government in the netherlands trying to pass
[3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:59.400]  laws restrictions that basically mean they will pay give a paltry amount of money to dutch farmers
[3:20:59.400 --> 3:21:07.000]  to not produce food again stripping the country of its sovereignty making it completely dependent
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:14.120]  on foreign imports making it a surf of the great reset we had an article yesterday
[3:21:14.120 --> 3:21:19.560]  dutch police fire live rounds at anti-green agenda protesters this has been bubbling under
[3:21:19.560 --> 3:21:26.040]  the surface for months it's now erupted they lied about firing live rounds on protesters they said
[3:21:26.040 --> 3:21:31.960]  the protesters were driving into police officers complete baloney video shows nothing of the
[3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:37.800]  sort this video went up a couple of hours ago it explains everything behind the protest why they're
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:43.080]  doing it and why this is going to spread across the continent this is revolved against the liberal
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:52.760]  world order here it is let's check in on how the general public is reacting to the liberal world
[3:21:52.760 --> 3:21:58.440]  order the liberal world order net zero climate change cuts the green agenda what we're saying
[3:21:58.440 --> 3:22:14.120]  good thing bad thing
[3:22:28.600 --> 3:22:40.360]  oh seems pretty unanimous the netherlands yellow vests 2.0 but what's the beef well it turns out
[3:22:40.360 --> 3:22:45.720]  that dutch farmers aren't too pleased about climate change technocrats passing laws which will
[3:22:45.720 --> 3:22:51.240]  completely destroy their livelihoods the government plans to restrict nitrogen and ammonia emissions
[3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:57.720]  by at least 50 by 2030 problem being fertilizers contain a large amount of nitrogen oxide and
[3:22:57.720 --> 3:23:03.640]  livestock produce ammonia in their urine and feces result farmers will be forced to call 30 of
[3:23:03.640 --> 3:23:08.040]  their livestock putting many of them out of business forever highlighting how this is a
[3:23:08.040 --> 3:23:13.080]  selective attack the same regulations won't be applied to the airline industry still at least
[3:23:13.080 --> 3:23:28.840]  the farmers are finding a use for all that unwanted feces by spraying it on government buildings
[3:23:28.840 --> 3:23:33.320]  tractors are also being used to block food distribution centers sending a message to
[3:23:33.320 --> 3:23:38.680]  the government about what happens when you with farmers some farmers even brought their cows to
[3:23:38.680 --> 3:23:43.160]  the dutch parliament threatening to slaughter them on the streets fishermen have also joined the
[3:23:43.160 --> 3:23:47.880]  cause blocking ports farmers in italy have also begun their nascent rebellion threatening to take
[3:23:47.880 --> 3:23:52.280]  their tractors to roam they're joined by polish farmers who are also marching in the streets
[3:23:52.280 --> 3:23:57.320]  but authorities in the netherlands have responded by telling demonstrators to go whistle and just
[3:23:57.320 --> 3:24:02.600]  like truedo did in canada demonizing them as extremists salmanating in an incident earlier
[3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:07.800]  this week where police fired live rounds at protesters in their tractors cops claimed the
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:13.640]  protesters were trying to run over the officers but video shows that that clearly didn't happen
[3:24:13.640 --> 3:24:40.200]  yeah despite bullet holes in the tractors by some miracle no one was injured and take a
[3:24:40.200 --> 3:24:47.560]  look at this prick who does he think he is rambo when blm protester dutch cops took the knee
[3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:52.920]  but when working class people slowly drive their cars at a protest they get guns pointed in their
[3:24:52.920 --> 3:25:03.320]  face they even changed the law so that cops who kill protesters are completely immune from
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:08.680]  manslaughter charges authorities have also allegedly planted agent provocateurs to infiltrate the
[3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:13.800]  protests presumably to both frame them for violence and to spy on activist leaders yeah if these
[3:25:13.800 --> 3:25:18.200]  fellas glow any brighter they're gonna outshine the sun activists have accused the government of
[3:25:18.200 --> 3:25:23.480]  cowing to globalist climate change policies at the behest of the world economic forum and it's
[3:25:23.480 --> 3:25:33.720]  infamous leader that want to be bond villain claus schwaub so we will see definitely a lot of
[3:25:33.720 --> 3:25:39.400]  anger schwaub's warning about increasing anger seems pretty prescient until you realize it's
[3:25:39.400 --> 3:25:45.000]  the globalist control freak green agenda that he fronts that's causing all the anger a lot of
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:50.120]  anger the netherlands is one of the largest exporters of me in the world and the largest
[3:25:50.120 --> 3:25:55.640]  in europe why when we're in a global food crisis caused by the current thing are they imposing
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:01.240]  policies that would jeopardize the food security of hundreds of millions of people why is danmark
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:06.520]  belgium and germany all considering the same measures western governments paying farmers to
[3:26:06.520 --> 3:26:11.640]  not produce food do they actually want to create a famine is this why they're preparing us all to
[3:26:11.640 --> 3:26:19.080]  eat bugs these are grasshopper kebabs technocrats order us to get used to energy rationing limits
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:24.360]  on hot water limits on the very temperature at which you're allowed to heat your own home while
[3:26:24.360 --> 3:26:30.520]  davos elites fresh from landing at lavish resorts in luxury private jets insist nations shouldn't
[3:26:30.520 --> 3:26:36.120]  exercise their sovereignty to upset the global green agenda while prince charles tells you to
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:42.360]  stop taking hot baths and forget about your annual family holiday the princes around on co2 belching
[3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:48.520]  helicopters to quote avoid the traffic while bill gates tells people entering fuel poverty that they
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:53.800]  should start paying carbon taxes and amplifies the davos mantra that private property for the
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:59.080]  average person will become a bygone relic as he voraciously snaps up record amounts of farmland
[3:26:59.080 --> 3:27:04.440]  across the united states so they want to drastically reduce our living standards leaving us starving
[3:27:04.440 --> 3:27:11.640]  and impoverished we need to accept that there will be some pain in the process a lot of anger
[3:27:11.640 --> 3:27:17.400]  is that the end game of the green agenda the liberal world order surely not
[3:27:17.400 --> 3:27:29.720]  but wait the fact checkers have arrived reuters says there's no evidence the dutch government
[3:27:29.720 --> 3:27:34.840]  is working with the world economic forum to impose the great reset that's the same reuters that
[3:27:34.840 --> 3:27:40.120]  enjoys an exclusive partnership for content distribution with the world economic forum
[3:27:40.120 --> 3:27:44.920]  sure they're totally not biased at all meanwhile on the flip side of the coin as working class
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:50.520]  farmers get brutalized upper middle class climate change activists and eco warriors get treated
[3:27:50.520 --> 3:27:56.680]  with kid gloves sarquin tabitha thiefy and friends are now gluing themselves to works of art to bring
[3:27:56.680 --> 3:28:02.840]  attention to the climate crisis the same climate crisis being pushed by every major institution
[3:28:02.840 --> 3:28:08.120]  legacy media outlet and government in the west yeah if your rhetoric mirrors that of every
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:13.640]  establishment tentacle in existence ever considered that you're not part of the rebellion and that
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:18.360]  you're doing the bidding of the very same establishment you claim to oppose turns out one
[3:28:18.360 --> 3:28:24.600]  of these just stop oil activists has clocked up 50 000 air miles in the last five years alone
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:29.560]  while virtue signaling about the dire threat posed by co2 emissions she's been personally
[3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:36.600]  responsible for emitting 13 tons of carbon dioxide it's okay when we do it while these useful idiots
[3:28:36.600 --> 3:28:42.040]  advocate for the globalist great reset that would exacerbate the already chronic cost of living crisis
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:47.880]  and are afforded lavish sympathetic media coverage and a light touch by authorities working class
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:52.680]  people across europe are seeing their futures decimated and whenever they dare speak
[3:28:55.880 --> 3:29:03.320]  at this point best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all and if we don't turn it
[3:29:03.320 --> 3:29:10.280]  around soon then it will only get worse but as bad as things are we still have time to prepare
[3:29:10.280 --> 3:29:17.080]  and that alone is something to be grateful for a gravity water filter will provide you with clean

[3:33:23.720 --> 3:33:37.560]  well the cost of living crisis has of course been exacerbated by the current thing the war in
[3:33:37.560 --> 3:33:44.360]  ukraine and nowhere has that pain been felt greater than in germany where as we reported last week
[3:33:44.360 --> 3:33:51.400]  they're now panic buying stoves and firewood to heat their homes because they fear energy rationing
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:33:57.240]  is going to be brought in for the winter we had this article a couple of days ago germans warned
[3:33:57.240 --> 3:34:04.040]  of hot water rationing limits a maximum allowed room temperatures this was a comment by hamburg's
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:08.440]  environment minister who warned germans that hot water could be rationed and limits on maximum
[3:34:08.440 --> 3:34:14.520]  room temperatures introduced as a result of the energy crisis which of course has been exacerbated
[3:34:14.520 --> 3:34:21.640]  by this blind unyielding support for ukraine pouring weapons into the conflict ensuring
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:27.320]  it lasts as long as possible state environment minister jens kersten announced that the hot
[3:34:27.320 --> 3:34:34.120]  water supply for private households could be reduced again this is all part of the agenda
[3:34:34.120 --> 3:34:40.600]  to lower your living standards as part of the great reset to make sure that you are energy
[3:34:40.600 --> 3:34:46.680]  dependent on basically the technocrats and there was another report today this is out the global
[3:34:46.680 --> 3:34:53.720]  and mail of canada germany's largest residential landlord vernovia to reduce heating for tenants
[3:34:53.720 --> 3:35:02.280]  to save energy this is the largest residential landlord in germany it owns 490 000 apartments
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:07.240]  again you'll own nothing and you'll be happy you'll freeze in your apartment and you'll be happy
[3:35:07.240 --> 3:35:14.200]  they apparently have the power to remotely turn down people's heating in the apartments that they
[3:35:14.200 --> 3:35:20.440]  own probably through smart meters i would guess but it says germany's largest residential landlord
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:25.960]  will reduce heating for tenants in many of its apartments at night as europe's biggest economy
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:32.360]  braces for possible gas crunch with failing russian fossil fuel imports of course germany is
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:39.320]  dependent on russia for its gas imports to a degree of over 30 russia has threatened to
[3:35:39.320 --> 3:35:47.000]  restrict the gas flow through Nord Stream even further as we inch towards the autumn and winter
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:54.200]  colder months the company in which owns 490 000 apartments in germany will cut heating output
[3:35:54.200 --> 3:36:01.080]  between 11 p.m and 6 a.m to 17 degrees celsius a spokesperson for the company said of course that's
[3:36:01.080 --> 3:36:06.200]  just the opening salvo the environment minister in hamburg is talking about restricting people's
[3:36:06.200 --> 3:36:12.200]  hot water at certain times of the day maybe they'll go back to a three day a week thing like we had
[3:36:12.200 --> 3:36:19.080]  here in the uk where there were electricity power cuts for hours and hours and hours every single day
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:25.000]  as our living standards decline in line with the great reset agenda that's what they want it's for
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:30.680]  the planet they'll continue to fly on you know co2 belching helicopters and private jets as they
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:36.760]  talk about this at davos of course says tenants will be able to use their heating as usual during
[3:36:36.760 --> 3:36:42.040]  the day oh how gracious of them and in the evening hours the rationing will not affect hot water supply
[3:36:43.160 --> 3:36:50.040]  and again you think about some of these apartments in eastern germany near russia gets pretty frigging
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:56.440]  cold in the winter months gets really cold in some areas says the reduced heating schedule will be
[3:36:56.440 --> 3:37:01.160]  rolled out gradually over the coming months and will be fully in place by the start of autumn
[3:37:01.880 --> 3:37:06.920]  little wonder then that germans are panic buying stoves and firewood as i just mentioned
[3:37:07.720 --> 3:37:12.360]  meanwhile on the same kind of subject from tomorrow and this is from yesterday in fact
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:18.120]  because this article was posted two days ago all new vehicles in the EU will have surveillance
[3:37:18.120 --> 3:37:25.320]  black boxes but don't worry they're saying it's voluntary at least for now these black boxes will
[3:37:25.320 --> 3:37:32.040]  measure technical data based on the vehicle speed braking steering wheel angle it's inclined on the
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:37.160]  road and whether the vehicle's various safety systems were in operation starting with seatbelts
[3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:43.240]  they say the data is not accessible for insurance companies but it will be accessible to law
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:48.680]  enforcement now if they've got a black box in your vehicle tracking all that data of course
[3:37:48.680 --> 3:37:55.000]  they're tracking everywhere you go and everything along with that has reclaimed the net reports
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  such systems are expected to eventually include speed limiting technology and i make the point in
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:07.160]  the article that as we move towards a communist chinese style social credit score system your
[3:38:07.160 --> 3:38:13.640]  benefits your privileges your right to mobility could well be restricted based on your political
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:19.800]  opinions we see that in china with millions of people being prevented from buying plane tickets
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:25.640]  train tickets being prevented from having access to certain areas certain entertainment events
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:31.160]  based on the fact that they posted something spicy on weibo.com that was critical of the
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:36.200]  chinese government so if you think there's no chance of that arriving in the west then think
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:43.240]  again because we've already had it to some extent new york to demand social media history for gun
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:48.280]  ownership people in new york who want a license for a gun will be required to hand over their
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:55.400]  social media history in order to pass a character and conduct test under new legislation then we
[3:38:55.400 --> 3:39:01.320]  had cnn discussing this a couple of days ago cnn suggests gun shop should check buyers social
[3:39:01.320 --> 3:39:07.320]  media pages before agreeing sales and of course it's to just make sure that they're not disturbed
[3:39:07.320 --> 3:39:12.920]  individuals but of course when the liberal world order thinks that if you support donald trump
[3:39:12.920 --> 3:39:19.080]  you're basically a far right extremist you can see how slippery this slope will become
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:24.440]  of course if they get away they're not going to use it to just check for mentally disturbed people
[3:39:24.440 --> 3:39:30.200]  they're going to use it to check for political opinions offensive social media posts and they're
[3:39:30.200 --> 3:39:36.120]  going to try and deny you your rights based on that i don't want us to stray too far from the
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:41.160]  great reset reduction of living standards cost of living crisis though in fact let's go to this
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:46.920]  quick video now i'll come back and get more into it this is people are losing interest in the current
[3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:52.120]  thing talks about germany and why polls show that people are less enthusiastic to support the war in
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:59.000]  ukraine because the massive impact on energy that it's having at home here is the clip whisper it
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:05.400]  quietly but westerners appear to be losing interest in the current thing as diesel and petrol prices
[3:40:05.400 --> 3:40:11.640]  continue to soar as the cost of living crisis bites harder i've noticed that sadly some of the
[3:40:11.640 --> 3:40:17.320]  ukraine flags are starting to be taken down despite the media and deep state talking heads
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:22.600]  dubiously claiming for months that russia was being defeated in ukraine it appears as though
[3:40:22.600 --> 3:40:28.200]  reality is setting in this weekend the washington post reported how analysts and us lawmakers
[3:40:28.200 --> 3:40:33.160]  are questioning whether american officials have portrayed the crisis in overly rosy terms and
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:38.200]  acknowledged that russian forces are gradually gaining more territory in eastern ukraine german
[3:40:38.200 --> 3:40:43.320]  television is starting to admit the obvious i feel that we have it's with a lager zu tun wo
[3:40:43.320 --> 3:40:48.040]  wir uns eine unangenehme war hat eingestehen müssen und die heißt dass russia in diesen krieg
[3:40:48.040 --> 3:40:54.440]  gewonnen hat ja jetzt sir richard barons former head of joint forces command told sky news russia
[3:40:54.440 --> 3:40:59.080]  is basically now winning russia has captured a hundred percent of lubansk oblast the first ukrainian
[3:40:59.080 --> 3:41:03.480]  oblast now completely out of kiev's control and the russian military installed the victory banner
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:08.920]  in belogorovka the polish prime minister also warned today that public interest in the conflict is
[3:41:08.920 --> 3:41:14.360]  waning rapidly i'm afraid that the coming months will bring more indifference said matias morowecki
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:19.400]  meanwhile putin has been able to more than cope with the sanctions thanks to a massive surplus
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:24.520]  created by soaring oil and gas prices and last month the ruble hit a five-year high against the
[3:41:24.520 --> 3:41:30.440]  dollar people in the west who back in march thanks to media cheerleading were pretty gung ho about
[3:41:30.440 --> 3:41:35.240]  the current thing now appear to be more concerned about the worsening cost of living crisis a new
[3:41:35.240 --> 3:41:40.280]  poll finds that 20 million germans are threatened with energy poverty and half the population
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:45.400]  fee is being unable to properly heat their homes this coming winter in the u.s. biden's job approval
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:50.840]  has fallen to its lowest level ever recorded and a poultry 11 percent of americans believe the white
[3:41:50.840 --> 3:41:55.640]  house narrative that putin is solely to blame for inflation and high gas prices looks like the regime
[3:41:55.640 --> 3:42:01.240]  may soon require a new current thing with which to distract attention from the real causes because
[3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:07.880]  this one might just have run its course now i'm going to come back on the other side and talk
[3:42:07.880 --> 3:42:13.800]  about a satirical article posted on the un website which was later withdrawn basically saying that
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:19.080]  worldwide hunger is a good thing but we had another article bill gates granted authority to buy
[3:42:19.080 --> 3:42:25.640]  2100 more acres of north dakota farmland again they're waging this war on farmers with the cost
[3:42:25.640 --> 3:42:31.320]  of fertilizer increasing across the globe the farmers as you saw earlier in netherlands are
[3:42:31.320 --> 3:42:36.200]  violently protesting because they're going to be hit with these restrictions which will force them
[3:42:36.200 --> 3:42:41.480]  to call 30 percent of their livestock the war is being waged on the farmers you're being told

[3:47:01.880 --> 3:47:06.600]  alex jones
[3:47:06.600 --> 3:47:13.960]  you're listening to summit.news with paul joseph watson
[3:47:17.960 --> 3:47:23.080]  you're being told you'll own nothing and you'll be happy farmers in the netherlands are being
[3:47:23.080 --> 3:47:28.760]  told that they're basically going to go out of business multi-generational businesses completely
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:35.160]  biting the dust as a result of technocratic globalist green energy climate change policies
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:40.360]  they're going to be forced off their land but bill gates is going to continue buying land
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:47.240]  in vast quantities of acreage across the united states of course one of the issues in the netherlands
[3:47:47.240 --> 3:47:52.680]  is the fact that they're the biggest exporter of meat in europe one of the biggest in the world
[3:47:53.320 --> 3:47:59.000]  and yet that capacity is going to be drastically reduced if these regulations which won't be applied
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:04.440]  to the airline industry are passed again making the netherlands and making much of europe
[3:48:04.440 --> 3:48:11.960]  dependent on foreign imports of food and maybe dependent on eating the bugs interesting parallel
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:18.600]  with this is the fact that the un and this is out of valiantnews.com has deleted a satirical
[3:48:18.600 --> 3:48:25.800]  article detailing the benefits of world hunger after an online backlash the un has removed a
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:30.600]  satirical article from their website that detailed the benefits of world hunger after its discovery
[3:48:30.600 --> 3:48:36.200]  online sparked an online backlash it was entitled the benefits of world hunger was written by professor
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:42.920]  george ken originally published in june 2008 he said quote in this article we sometimes talk
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:47.240]  about hunger in the world as if it were a scourge that all of us want to see abolished adding that
[3:48:47.240 --> 3:48:52.600]  hunger is actually a great positive value to many people indeed it's fundamental to the working of
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:57.480]  the world's economy. Pungry people are the most productive people especially where there's a need
[3:48:57.480 --> 3:49:04.600]  for manual labor interesting that that was posted and then deleted from the un website again
[3:49:04.600 --> 3:49:10.840]  describing basically the serfs as exactly that under a neo feudalist system where they're forced
[3:49:10.840 --> 3:49:16.520]  off the land and there's not a land of plenty a land of milk and honey and we're all dependent
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:24.760]  on these technocratic globalist institutions merely to be fed i remind listeners that things
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:30.920]  like meat were a delicacy things like beef were a delicacy in communist china right up until the
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:36.680]  late 80s where it was like a monthly treat that you could have a little slither of beef i think
[3:49:36.680 --> 3:49:42.040]  that's what they have in mind for us many people aren't happy with it though that's why you see
[3:49:42.040 --> 3:49:48.760]  massive riots and demonstrations across the continent let's go to this clip now though
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:54.280]  because i wanted to come back and talk about this we've also got some safe and effective vaccine news
[3:49:54.280 --> 3:49:59.960]  to cover but the farmers in the netherlands are being treated similarly to how the freedom convoy
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:06.280]  truckers were treated in canada and another story that basically flew under the radar over the past
[3:50:06.280 --> 3:50:12.760]  few days was this government funded booklet being sent out to schools in canada that tells
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:20.680]  school children to be suspicious of people who use quote the free speech argument here is the clip
[3:50:20.680 --> 3:50:28.760]  video is entitled guess what he's done now let's roll it after the freedom convoy outrage did you
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:33.720]  think that the true doregy might back off for a bit well thank you again the canadian government
[3:50:33.720 --> 3:50:39.320]  via taxpayers has funded a booklet being sent to schools across the country that teaches children
[3:50:39.320 --> 3:50:46.360]  to be wary of people who use quote the free speech argument because it was among the common
[3:50:46.360 --> 3:50:52.120]  defences of hate propaganda the point of this free toolkit is to help parents educators in the
[3:50:52.120 --> 3:50:56.520]  community identify and intervene when a young person he's being groomed and recruited by a white
[3:50:56.520 --> 3:51:02.280]  supremacist movement before it's too late the country's diversity minister yes that's an actual
[3:51:02.280 --> 3:51:07.960]  position more like clown world minister armed husan told reporters that brainwashing kids to be
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:14.280]  paranoid about free speech would help quote teach core values to our kids listen when your core
[3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:19.320]  value is to denigrate and disavow one of the founding bedrock principles of your country you've
[3:51:19.320 --> 3:51:25.960]  lost your country the book also urges educators to correct kids who express support for problematic
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:31.480]  political leaders like donald trump it also denounces the red n-sign flag as a hate symbol
[3:51:31.480 --> 3:51:37.080]  because its usage denotes a desire to return to canada's demographics before 1967 when it was
[3:51:37.080 --> 3:51:43.960]  predominantly white like being white is a bad thing it isn't listen approve 268,400 canadian
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:49.640]  dollars funding for the booklet titled confronting and preventing hating canadian schools wait so
[3:51:49.640 --> 3:51:54.680]  it's okay to teach four-year-olds that there are 200 different genders it's okay to expose children
[3:51:54.680 --> 3:52:00.200]  to transvestite strippers in the form of drag queen story time but telling them that free speech
[3:52:00.200 --> 3:52:06.120]  is anything other than a dirty dangerous concept oh no we can't have that this is an education
[3:52:06.120 --> 3:52:11.880]  it's reeducation it's hyper parties and social engineering lest we forget that this is the same
[3:52:11.880 --> 3:52:16.760]  government that responded to canadian truckers expressing their free speech by brutalizing them
[3:52:16.760 --> 3:52:22.040]  with riot cops freezing their bank accounts and treating them like domestic terrorists your kids
[3:52:22.040 --> 3:52:28.600]  are being taught that free speech is hate propaganda while the state itself uses actual hate propaganda
[3:52:28.600 --> 3:52:34.600]  to demonize an entire segment of society who knew that the guy who said he admired china's
[3:52:34.600 --> 3:52:41.800]  dictatorship admiration i actually have for china their basic dictatorship would end up doing all this
[3:52:41.800 --> 3:52:50.040]  to canada now we talked about the social credit system emerging in the west in terms of new york
[3:52:50.040 --> 3:52:55.160]  trying to pass new legislation demanding social media history for gun ownership but also cnn
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:53:01.480]  saying that social media pages should be checked before people are allowed to buy guns we also have
[3:53:01.480 --> 3:53:06.680]  this out of remix news left wing german minister wants to seize guns from members as conservative
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:12.360]  afd party again claiming they're all extremist because they support an alternative right wing
[3:53:12.360 --> 3:53:19.800]  political party we also had in the uk and this brings us to our final clip hallifax bank openly
[3:53:19.800 --> 3:53:26.440]  saying that people who express offensive concepts ideas or use offensive words on the internet will
[3:53:26.440 --> 3:53:33.000]  have their bank accounts cancelled this is called they made it worse here is the clip well if you
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:37.720]  thought hallifax couldn't put their foot in it even more think again fresh from treading on one
[3:53:37.720 --> 3:53:42.680]  giant steaming turd they just trod on another one for those who missed it hallifax bank put out a
[3:53:42.680 --> 3:53:47.560]  cringe tweet virtue signaling about gender pronouns and a follow-up statement asserting that the policy
[3:53:47.560 --> 3:53:53.000]  would help avoid accidental misgendering q massive backlash but instead of letting that
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:58.600]  backlash dissipate they doubled down by allowing some woke staffer called andy to tell customers
[3:53:58.600 --> 3:54:03.240]  to close their accounts if they didn't like it countless customers then did close their accounts
[3:54:03.240 --> 3:54:08.360]  costing the bank millions of pounds worth of investment experts called it the worst pr blunder
[3:54:08.360 --> 3:54:14.840]  in british business history but instead of apologizing or just letting it go they made it even worse
[3:54:14.840 --> 3:54:19.080]  instead of reaching out to customers who are thinking of cancelling their accounts and trying
[3:54:19.080 --> 3:54:25.080]  to convince them politely otherwise they're now threatening to report them to the police hallifax
[3:54:25.080 --> 3:54:30.280]  linked to its inclusion and diversity policy where it said it would contact police if people
[3:54:30.280 --> 3:54:35.240]  behave in an inappropriate way towards their social media channels and described inappropriate
[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:40.280]  behavior as racist sexist homophobic transphobic or ablest behavior such action may include
[3:54:40.280 --> 3:54:45.480]  account closure or contacting the police if necessary yeah your local friendly bank will
[3:54:45.480 --> 3:54:51.160]  now at best shut down your account if you express political views or use words that they deem to
[3:54:51.160 --> 3:54:56.360]  be offensive or at worst they'll actually try to get you convicted and thrown in prison for it
[3:54:56.360 --> 3:55:01.160]  remember when banks were places to keep your money and not political commissars acting on
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:08.440]  behalf of the thought police checking for disloyalty towards ragey messaging oh how we miss the good old days
[3:55:08.440 --> 3:55:16.600]  got a couple of minutes left so i'm going to wade into this latest covid news daily skeptic
[3:55:16.600 --> 3:55:23.480]  reports twice as many vaccine deaths of covid deaths in the united states poll finds there's more
[3:55:23.480 --> 3:55:28.760]  than twice as many americans have lost a household member to a covid vaccine injury as i've lost
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:34.760]  one to covid gee i wonder why that is that's a shocking finding of a new poll of 1500 americans
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:40.440]  carried out by the polling company poll fish 3.6 percent of respondents said someone in their
[3:55:40.440 --> 3:55:48.120]  household had died from covid 19 but 7.9 percent said one had died as a result of covid vaccination
[3:55:48.120 --> 3:55:54.360]  now correct me if i'm wrong but last time i checked deaths from covid vaccines weren't supposed to be
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:56:02.120]  double deaths from covid itself surely they wouldn't lie to us meanwhile information
