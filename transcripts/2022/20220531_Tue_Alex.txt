[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.000 --> 00:35.000]  Massive inflation, exploding crime, collapsing borders.
[00:35.000 --> 00:38.000]  Announcements of future lockdowns.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  World IDs, even leave your home.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  Horst injection with GMO.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  Nanotech-filled poison.
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  And of course, the United Nations Unitarian Agenda
[00:53.000 --> 00:56.000]  of disarming any civilian population on Earth
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  so that the state has a monopoly of power.
[00:59.000 --> 01:04.000]  That's where we are in the year 2022, on this May 31st,
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  Tuesday, transmission.
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.000]  Here is the puppet leader obviously stole the last election,
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  fresh off of banning protests and declaring martial law,
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  announcing the most draconian gun control ever seen in North America,
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  ahead of total confiscation,
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  following the same model of New Zealand, the UK, and Australia.
[01:25.000 --> 01:30.000]  We're introducing legislation to implement a national freeze
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  on handgun ownership.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.000]  What this means is that it will no longer be possible
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  to buy, sell, transfer, or import handguns anywhere in Canada.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  In other words, we're capping the market for handguns.
[01:50.000 --> 01:57.000]  Many of the cultists, all triple-bats, were in their masks.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  And this is a cult.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  The Nazi armbands, they were masked.
[02:04.000 --> 02:07.000]  As a further part of this new legislation,
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  we're also fighting gun smuggling and trafficking
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  by increasing maximum criminal penalties
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  and providing more tools for law enforcement
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  to investigate firearm crimes.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  And we'll require the permanent alteration of long-gun magazines
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  so they can never hold more than five rounds.
[02:27.000 --> 02:31.000]  These are actions that doctors, experts, and chiefs of police
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.000]  have been calling for for years.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  And we're acting on their advice.
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  I also want to thank the advocates,
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  many of whom are here today, for your tireless efforts.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  The people guarding this criminal,
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  too many of you won't have any grief for these magazines
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  or at the root of the work that you do.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  I want to recognize that on behalf of all Canadians.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  I want to thank you for your strength.
[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000]  Yes, sir.
[03:00.000 --> 03:03.000]  This is a guy that said right after he got elected a few years ago,
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  the first time he stole the last election evidence of overwhelming,
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  that he wanted a dictatorship like China,
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  and that's what he admires.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  He's made all these other statements about how you shouldn't have free speech.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  And so, the long, not dark night for Canada begins.
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  But even people that I've known for decades,
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  that I would call liberals 20 years ago,
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  like Joe Rogan, are now 100% pro-second amendment,
[03:31.000 --> 03:34.000]  and they get that when you take the guns from the general public,
[03:34.000 --> 03:37.000]  only the state and the criminals have them,
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  and horrors invariably follow.
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  Most of the crime in this country is in Democrat-run blue cities.
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  We know it's three to five times on average any other area.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  That's the same thing in Canada.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  In the cities, you have a bunch of disarmed sheep
[03:51.000 --> 03:54.000]  and criminals running around feeding on them,
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  and the rural areas almost no crime because people are still armed.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  But not for long. They follow an exact formula.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Let's go out to break with Joe Rogan laying out the basic facts we all know.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  I wrote this thing once,
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  so this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  And that's what it is.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  There's so many guns.
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  There's more guns than there are people.
[04:17.000 --> 04:19.000]  I don't think it's a gun situation,
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  and I don't think you can change the fact that there's...
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  And I don't think it's wise to take the guns away from the people
[04:24.000 --> 04:26.000]  and leave all the power to the government.
[04:26.000 --> 04:29.000]  We see how they are even with an armed populace.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  They still have a tendency towards totalitarianism,
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  and the more increased power and control you have over people,
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  the easier it is for them to do what they do.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And there's a natural inclination when you are a person in power
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  to try to hold more power and acquire more power.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  And there's never an inclination to give more power back to the people,
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  to give more freedoms back to the people.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  Freedom's laws are rarely regained.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Perfectly said, common sense, and it's spreading fast.
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there
[05:04.000 --> 05:09.000]  that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy, our libido
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  that are also amazing pre- or post-workouts.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  And we went out and looked at the top brands, the top reviews,
[05:14.000 --> 05:16.000]  and came out with alpha power.
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.000]  Now, it's so hard to source good, clean herbs like we have in this
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  that it's been sold out for more than six months,
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  but now alpha power is back in stock at infowarstore.com at 40% off.

[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  and then try it for yourself.
[05:35.000 --> 05:39.000]  Now, the formula is made for men, but it does amazing things for women as well.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  Find out what just one of the ingredients does,
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  LJ100 and then go on from there.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  Alpha power, exclusively available right now,
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  40% off at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war.
[05:52.000 --> 05:56.000]  You are really missing out if you don't experience what alpha power does.
[05:56.000 --> 06:04.000]  It has improved my life and so many others, just incredible levels.
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  Trudeau's father, who was also the leader of Canada at one point,
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  said that he admired Trudeau Castro and Mao Zedong
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  and traveled there to be taught at the knee of Mao Zedong.
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  And his son, when he was first getting elected, he clearly stole the last election.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  Trudeau said that he admires dictatorship in government.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  When asked, what do you admire most?
[06:56.000 --> 07:02.000]  He wasn't joking, he said, I admire China's basic dictatorship
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  and that's why you see Canada mirroring much of what Communist China has done
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  in the last 30 months with the whole COVID power grab,
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.000]  working through the World Economic Forum.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  And that's what's most important.
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Klaus Schwab has openly said, we've played the clips here,
[07:19.000 --> 07:28.000]  that Trudeau is the model of the World Economic Forum's, quote,
[07:28.000 --> 07:36.000]  penetration of governments and that they control half the cabinets of the world's governments.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  And then in some cases, even more, where they totally control it,
[07:41.000 --> 07:47.000]  in the case of the Canadian government.
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  The deputy prime minister is the same lady that's on the board of the World Economic Forum
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  and has been announcing plans for censorship, gun confiscation, you name it,
[07:59.000 --> 08:02.000]  and that's why Trudeau has now come out and said,
[08:02.000 --> 08:12.000]  we're freezing all handgun sales and all sales of firearms that can hold more than five rounds of ammunition.
[08:12.000 --> 08:17.000]  That's the exact blueprint of the UK 30 years ago, taking the guns,
[08:17.000 --> 08:22.000]  the exact blueprint of Australia 20 years ago and New Zealand 20 years ago, taking the guns.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  First, they ban the sale, then they register everything,
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  then they ban everything down to single shot rifles that you've got to have special licenses for
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  if you live on a farm.
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  Of course, Mexico has a crime rate three to five times or even higher in some areas in the US.
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  They have a total gun ban for their citizens, though their citizens still secretly own guns.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  Those are some of the only areas that are pretty low in crimes and rural areas
[08:50.000 --> 08:57.000]  where the local farmers ban together and stand up against the cartels and the corrupt governments.
[08:57.000 --> 09:06.000]  So it's here and ghostguns.com on Twitter put together a nice little boil down, mass shootings are tragedies.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  Do not fall for their, quote, solutions.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  Number of people killed by gun violence, Virginia Tech 33.
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  Number killed by communist violence after gun confiscation in China, 65 million.
[09:21.000 --> 09:27.000]  Sandy Hook 28, Russia after government confiscates guns 25 million.
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  Yuval Day 22, Cambodia 2 million.
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  UT Tower 18, North Korea 2 million.
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  Parkland 17, Ethiopia 1.7 million.
[09:40.000 --> 09:48.000]  Columbia, Columbine 15, Afghanistan 1.5 million.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  Santa Fe 10, Eastern Block 1 million.
[09:53.000 --> 09:58.000]  And it goes on with what happens after the guns are confiscated.
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  And that is a very conservative analysis of this, but it's true.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  And that's exactly what Joe Rogan and myself and anybody else that's being honest is saying,
[10:10.000 --> 10:15.000]  is that you have a corrupt system that wants to defund the police, that wants to take your guns,
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  while they have security out to yin-yang and own guns themselves.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  This is their desire for tyranny.
[10:21.000 --> 10:26.000]  And remember, Trudeau said, you're not allowed to have your protest, they're terrorists.
[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  And he made all these statements about how he's signing everybody on to agenda 2030 to cut off the carbon.
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  And he made all these announcements about you don't own your body and we're going to make you take these shots.
[10:36.000 --> 10:43.000]  And wouldn't let Canadians travel outside of their country even if they had, had the shots that don't work.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  And then his basic dictatorship comments.
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.000]  They're trying to find it, but we played a compilation back during the whole trucker strike that just had some of the insane things.
[10:53.000 --> 11:01.000]  This guy had to say, but you ask, why do they sound like a cartoon character from a cartoon depicting a dictator?
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  Why does this read like 1984?
[11:03.000 --> 11:10.000]  Because it's happened lots of other times in history and tyrannies are more common than free nations.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  That's why America was so special.
[11:13.000 --> 11:19.000]  People came here, everybody else in the world lusted after freedom because they never had a shot at it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:27.000]  No economic freedom, no freedom of mobility, no freedom to choose their own career, no freedom to defend themselves.
[11:27.000 --> 11:35.000]  A corrupt bureaucracies ruling over the people, feudalism.
[11:35.000 --> 11:46.000]  And now that entire system that our ancestors have been fighting for, Europeans particularly, since Magna Carta in 1215,
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  and common law paid for in blood so that you would have basic rights,
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  is all being flushed down the toilet very quickly and rights taken are seldom regained or returned.
[12:01.000 --> 12:08.000]  That is a well-known maxim.
[12:08.000 --> 12:18.000]  Rights lost are seldom regained and we have a racing to the finish line by these tyrants.
[12:18.000 --> 12:26.000]  A racing to the finish line to bring in a world ID that will track and control and monitor and tell you what you can buy
[12:26.000 --> 12:32.000]  and what you can't buy with programmable money and a social credit score and a universal basic income
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  because we're being made obsolete.
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.000]  And they admit the plan is to lock you in your house and make you live and work through the metaverse.
[12:42.000 --> 12:49.000]  They're pushing humans out of the workplace to bring in robots for control, not as an innovation.
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.000]  Here's some of what the dictator, because he clearly stole the election up there,
[12:53.000 --> 12:57.000]  probably got elected the first time, but the evidence overwhelming stole the second one.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  That snap election last year during the whole quote pandemic, the pandemic.
[13:02.000 --> 13:14.000]  So here's some of the dictator to the north.
[13:14.000 --> 13:29.000]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing
[13:29.000 --> 13:35.000]  do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other,
[13:35.000 --> 13:45.000]  who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms,
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  our rights, our values as a country.
[13:47.000 --> 13:58.000]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless.
[13:58.000 --> 14:11.000]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags. We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[14:15.000 --> 14:29.000]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China, because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start investing in solar.
[14:33.000 --> 14:40.000]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  That I find quite interesting.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting your fundamental rights,
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  and the charter says that we're wrong, we're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[14:56.000 --> 15:08.000]  The federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  We went after the funding. Our efforts combined with the city's efforts eliminated the GoFundMe.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  Ten million dollars are no longer accessible to the demonstrators.
[15:19.000 --> 15:29.000]  There are other funding avenues that we continue to aggressively go after through intelligence, information, coordination with financial institutions, and all three levels of government.
[15:29.000 --> 15:42.000]  We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules so that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  We will be relentless in pursuing the funding that has enabled this demonstration to continue to this point.
[15:47.000 --> 15:56.000]  These changes cover all forms of transactions, including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  I want to be very clear.

[19:18.000 --> 19:26.000]  Hey, I'm in my 60s, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I worked them into the ground, and you wanted to why?
[19:26.000 --> 19:33.000]  And I've tested this, and I've taken your B12, and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price. I really do.
[19:33.000 --> 19:43.000]  I take that B12, and I'm electric, man. I can run 10 miles. I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department, and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah,
[19:43.000 --> 19:51.000]  for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, and I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.
[20:13.000 --> 20:35.000]  It's here. We all live to see it. In the year 2022, racing towards 2030, the New World Order's agenda to end free societies worldwide and establish a casual society worldwide dictatorship
[20:35.000 --> 20:47.000]  to carry out the forced depopulation of 90 percent, and those that live will be forced to become cyborg transhumanists in the official statements by the Bilderberg Group's public spokesperson,
[20:47.000 --> 21:02.000]  Klaus Schwab and his high priest, Yuval Harari. Unbelievable. Tredot, and we're going to play the clip coming up next segment, said that he wants a dictatorship,
[21:02.000 --> 21:16.000]  and Klaus Schwab said, we'll play that clip, that Tredot, Justin Tredot, his father admired dictators, and he says he admires dictatorships and basic dictatorships,
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  is now moving to ban the sale of any type of semi-automatic or handgun, and then of course confiscate is the next phase.
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  It's an exact formula that they have followed in other Commonwealth countries around the world, and Canada is not really independent.
[21:32.000 --> 21:45.000]  It's under the Governor General of the British Empire. Incredible information to be living in these days, and here are two extremely important graphs that I'll describe.
[21:45.000 --> 21:58.000]  For radio listeners, TV viewers can see these. Figure one, this is from the federal government's own statistics, is the total amount of overdose deaths,
[21:58.000 --> 22:11.000]  and of course they're a lot higher than this, not all of them get reported, but you can see starting in 1999, it was 18,000 steadily climbing as prescription illegal drugs both flood,
[22:11.000 --> 22:23.000]  and by the year 2020, we haven't gotten numbers in about two years yet, it's at 91,000, the latest numbers just came out, it's over 110,000 a year.
[22:23.000 --> 22:37.000]  So 110,000 in 2021, 91,799 in 2020, quite the acceleration straight up.
[22:37.000 --> 22:56.000]  Now let's compare that to mass shooting deaths. The lowest year was 2002, basically zero, it says here on the graph, from the FBI's own numbers.
[22:56.000 --> 23:12.000]  The worst year was Vegas, you can see that at 100 and 18 people, you can see as it goes then off the graph there.
[23:12.000 --> 23:36.000]  So 118 people, 118 people, humans, versus over 100,000 people.
[23:36.000 --> 23:46.000]  In the year 2021, we don't have numbers obviously for this year yet.
[23:46.000 --> 23:53.000]  So what's bigger, what's bigger, drug overdoses or mass shootings?
[23:53.000 --> 24:11.000]  But I use this analogy because it's the perfect one, Jaws came out in 1972 and for five years straight, it cut the amount of people on the east and west coast going and staying in little hotels and beach houses to go fishing and swimming
[24:11.000 --> 24:21.000]  because people saw Jaws, made by Steven Spielberg, great movie, totally unrealistic, and they thought that Jaws would eat them and kill them.
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  So they put national ads out, you can type it into Google and click images, ads telling people it's safe to go to the beach that sharks won't eat them.
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  And they would show the statistics that oh, only eight people died in the world of great white attacks.
[24:38.000 --> 24:42.000]  They would give the number, the average is about 12 a year.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  They'd say it's safe, please come back to the beach.
[24:46.000 --> 24:54.000]  While I'm not lessening the poor dead children and the evil act that happened, one child being executed for no reason is abhorrent.
[24:54.000 --> 25:12.000]  But the worst year in U.S. history of mass, senseless shootings is 118 versus 100 plus thousand for drug overdoses and it's only climbing.
[25:12.000 --> 25:16.000]  Think about that.
[25:16.000 --> 25:25.000]  Think about that long and hard and let that sink in and realize how nonsensical all of this is.
[25:25.000 --> 25:40.000]  And ask yourselves why we are so nonsensical and how we've been trained to be so vapid and shallow that all over the news we're told in children's science shows
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  say there's no difference between men and women and we have the same chromosomes, which isn't true,
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  and that men can have babies and that oh, two women got pregnant from another woman in a jail or a prison
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  or five women got pregnant from another woman.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  It is the murder of logic.
[25:59.000 --> 26:07.000]  It is the murder of common sense and it's the same reason that many beach towns
[26:07.000 --> 26:14.000]  for the years after, in fact, they never fully recovered.
[26:14.000 --> 26:26.000]  It's the reason so many beach towns went bankrupt because of one Hollywood movie and the copycat movies that got made.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  That's the same thing with these mass shootings.
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  They probably made what, 20 movies after Jaws? They made four or five Jaws? They made a bunch of others?
[26:37.000 --> 26:48.000]  Or piranhas are eating people and everything else and folks stop swimming in the ocean because they thought Jaws was going to eat them
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  and it's the same thing here.
[26:50.000 --> 26:56.000]  And then the more security and the more police and the more everything and then still it happens because the media hypes it
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.000]  and that's why it's going up. That's why mass shootings are going up.
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  Still incredibly rare, but the more they hype them, the same way you can hype people to not swim or go to the beach
[27:08.000 --> 27:17.000]  because you're scared of Jaws, even most adults I know, I'll say, hey, let's swim out to that buoy, 200 yards.
[27:17.000 --> 27:26.000]  Oh, I don't want to do that. They're the sharks.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  And then of course there's something kills way more than drug overdoses.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  It's estimated that a quarter million people die a year of hospital infections alone.
[27:39.000 --> 27:49.000]  And then you add hospital mistakes. It's another 80, 90,000. You're getting up there close to 400,000 deaths.
[27:49.000 --> 27:56.000]  Oh, what about automobile accidents, hundreds of thousands a year? Do we need to ban cars because it's a dangerous thing?
[27:56.000 --> 28:02.000]  Living is dangerous and the nanny state wants to lock you in your house in the metaverse.
[28:02.000 --> 28:09.000]  The World Economic Forum announced it to lower your carbon footprint so that clean robots can live your life for you
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  and so you won't even know how to go even buy your own groceries, much less grow your own food.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  This is all part of the defanging and the domestication of the people of the world
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  so that we will not resist while we are forcibly depopulated.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story. We're going to come back.
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  More on the Canadian gun ban.
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  Biden has let slip their plan for guns here, banning the ammunition in calibers.
[28:40.000 --> 28:47.000]  Not just guns now. It's all coming up on this special emergency transmission.

[29:34.000 --> 29:38.000]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase.
[29:38.000 --> 29:43.000]  With one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of come and take it
[29:43.000 --> 29:48.000]  and the reverse side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription free men bear arms.

[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  Info Wars has made history. You have made history in your support of Info Wars.
[31:06.000 --> 31:12.000]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the sensors has been Patriot Apparel
[31:12.000 --> 31:18.000]  so we can identify each other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[31:18.000 --> 31:21.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer or your wardrobe.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[31:38.000 --> 31:45.000]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history. We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[31:45.000 --> 31:51.000]  So, thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic shirts,
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can. I want to thank you all for your support.
[31:56.000 --> 32:09.000]  infowarstore.com.
[32:26.000 --> 32:41.000]  So, thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com.
[32:56.000 --> 33:01.000]  So, thank you all for watching until they're gone.
[33:26.000 --> 33:35.000]  I have to say, when I mentioned our names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on,
[33:35.000 --> 33:40.000]  they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[33:40.000 --> 33:48.000]  But what we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[33:48.000 --> 33:55.000]  President of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[33:55.000 --> 34:07.000]  So, yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I would know that half of this cabinet
[34:07.000 --> 34:15.000]  or even more half of this cabinet are for our actually young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[34:15.000 --> 34:21.000]  And that's true in Argentina as well.
[34:21.000 --> 34:28.000]  It's true in Argentina and it's true in France. No, I may be the President who is a young global leader,
[34:28.000 --> 34:34.000]  but what is important for me?
[34:34.000 --> 34:44.000]  And last Monday, from Geneva, Switzerland, the newly minted leader of the UN, Klaus Schwab, under treaty,
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  as the two organizations publicly merged, same globalists created both organizations,
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.000]  announced that they control the world and they control your governments and Klaus Schwab is on record.
[34:56.000 --> 35:02.000]  It's even on his Wikipedia page with a link to his own site saying they don't believe in democracy.
[35:02.000 --> 35:08.000]  They don't believe in people running their own countries, that they don't believe the stakeholders should be in control.
[35:08.000 --> 35:12.000]  That means a corporate dictatorship.
[35:12.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's so surreal to sit here and watch this authoritarian transformation
[35:18.000 --> 35:25.000]  where corporate media defend it and to see classical so-called liberals become such fascist.
[35:25.000 --> 35:31.000]  But they're being paid to do so. The New World Order is making its big move.
[35:31.000 --> 35:36.000]  I want to show you in a moment a clip from Biden.
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.000]  Yeah, there it is. We capture the democratic institutions and structures.
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.000]  We capture them. We control them.
[35:46.000 --> 35:53.000]  The people will have no say, no free will. You want to hear the clips again?
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  You do not own your body. We do. We will put chips in you.
[35:57.000 --> 36:03.000]  You will live in men of us not to leave home. These are quotes.
[36:03.000 --> 36:12.000]  Outrageously evil, outrageously, fabulously over the top dangerous.
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  And now their minion, Justin Trudeau, who says he admires dictatorships
[36:18.000 --> 36:24.000]  and wants a dictatorship for Canada and who said people that hold unacceptable views,
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.000]  that don't want lockdowns, you will be arrested.
[36:28.000 --> 36:37.000]  And are we surprised that Pretty Boy is following the WEF's orders to set the example to take the guns?
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  The Democratic Party, the WEF, the ADL, the Southern Prairie Law Center.
[36:43.000 --> 36:49.000]  They've all said in the last month, we must follow the directives and examples of the European Union
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  when it comes to censorship and they threaten Elon Musk.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  You go ahead and try to buy Twitter. We'll arrest you if you let people talk.
[36:58.000 --> 37:02.000]  We're not going down the road to tyranny. We have arrived.
[37:02.000 --> 37:11.000]  We're not almost there. We're here. And like quicksand, we're sinking into it faster and faster and faster.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  The good news is, there's a global awakening. The good news is, evil always falls.
[37:15.000 --> 37:22.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is going to get so bad if our leaders don't start identifying the takeover that's happening.
[37:22.000 --> 37:28.000]  And finally, some Republican leaders like Rand Paul and Ron DeSantis are doing that.
[37:28.000 --> 37:34.000]  But we better see a lot more of it and we better see it fast.
[37:34.000 --> 37:40.000]  And we're not going to see it come from the top. It's going to come from the grassroots, calling your congressmen and women,
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  going to their events, sending them information, calling talk radio, getting online and speaking up.
[37:46.000 --> 37:50.000]  You need to start your own Facebook show, your own YouTube show, till they ban you.
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  You need to start your own dependent sites. Everybody, whether you're a business owner or a preacher,
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  you need to start your own pro-freedom, anti-New World Order movement.
[37:58.000 --> 38:04.000]  And whether you get a thousand people to listen or a million, together we will defeat them.
[38:04.000 --> 38:11.000]  The answer is mobilizing the people. They would not be trying to censor and silence everyone if we were weak.
[38:11.000 --> 38:18.000]  They would not be doing all this outrageous stuff out in the open that is so classically bonafide totalitarian
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  if we didn't have power and if we couldn't stop them.
[38:23.000 --> 38:30.000]  The only way this can succeed is that if you advocate your authority and hand it over to these criminals.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  Now, I want to play a clip of Biden here in a moment where he tips his hand on the plan.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  And we know it's a formula that's been used around the world. We already know the formula.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  We're going to be laying it out here in a moment, but this is a formula or steps towards disarming you.
[38:48.000 --> 38:55.000]  And if you don't think they'll do it here, you're wrong. Let me say this very slowly to sink in
[38:55.000 --> 39:02.000]  to the board members of the NRA and others that listen to this show daily, who I know already understand this.
[39:02.000 --> 39:06.000]  But people like Ted Nugent, daily listener.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  Ted, you're a major leader.
[39:10.000 --> 39:16.000]  And Ted was asking me on the phone.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  I guess it was this Monday morning.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  How bad is it going to get?
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Because the American people aren't going to put up with gun confiscation.
[39:26.000 --> 39:31.000]  And I said that's exactly the plan.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  They know it will cause a civil war. That's why they're going to try it.
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.000]  They know they've already lost politically.
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.000]  That's why they're going to dictatorship with the illusion of freedom through staged elections, the Venezuelan model.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  The Joseph Stalin model. They had elections.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  He said, I don't care who cast the ballot.
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  All that matters is who counts the votes.
[39:56.000 --> 40:01.000]  And so we're at a very dangerous crossroads right now.
[40:01.000 --> 40:05.000]  And if you think things are bad now, ladies and gentlemen,
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  they are not going to stop until 90% of us are dead.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  And that's their public goal because they tell their collaborators, oh, we're still going to leave some people.
[40:13.000 --> 40:18.000]  Obviously, the idiots that go along with this are going to get killed too.
[40:18.000 --> 40:25.000]  It was Julius Caesar that said, I love treason, but I hate traders.
[40:25.000 --> 40:30.000]  And the rule is the traders that help bring down a society
[40:30.000 --> 40:35.000]  are the first people the new rulers kill.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  And we the people were the rulers to a certain extent for a while.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  That's all being swept away.
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  So we're going to come back in the long segment of the hour and get into this Biden statement and give you some powerful examples.
[40:49.000 --> 40:57.000]  But I want to say this, there is a massive unprecedented attack on free speech, as I was just saying.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  And Info Wars is the front lines. We are the heart.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  We are the brain. We are the soul of the human awakening.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  You are the heart and the guts and the mind and the will.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  And thank you for standing with us. You know who you are.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  Those that have bought product, those that have spread the word, those that have prayed for us,
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  those that have made donations in Bitcoin.
[41:14.000 --> 41:21.000]  Thank you so much at infowars.com forward slash crypto and other cryptocurrencies.
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.000]  And we have a coin that we've already sold 65% of and it's going to sell out very, very quickly.
[41:28.000 --> 41:37.000]  It's the third and final coin, the founding member set at 1776coin.com or patriotcollectibles.com.
[41:37.000 --> 41:45.000]  And when you order it and leave your email, you will get a lot of special benefits and things into the future
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  and new things are going to be launching.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  So this is something very, very special.
[41:49.000 --> 41:55.000]  It's your last chance. There won't be any other founding member coins to go to 1776coin.com
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  and secure the second amendment coin that we designed six months ago,
[41:59.000 --> 42:05.000]  that was minted over a month ago, that was delivered, I guess on Monday,
[42:05.000 --> 42:11.000]  we went to sell right when they got here and it's available now.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  I guess last Monday is what I meant to say.
[42:13.000 --> 42:22.000]  And so the 1776coin is here and I want to thank all of you that got the first two coins.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  This is the third and final free men bear arms on the front, on the back, on the front.
[42:29.000 --> 42:32.000]  Come and take it. It is powerful.
[42:32.000 --> 42:38.000]  1776coin.com or AAA-253-3139.
[42:38.000 --> 42:42.000]  You are our boosters, you are our sponsors, the viewers and listeners like you
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  and you are changing the world and I want to thank you and I want to encourage everybody
[42:45.000 --> 42:51.000]  to be part of this at 1776coin.com or call toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  We also have the big Memorial Day special running right now.
[42:54.000 --> 43:23.000]  Up to 60% off at double-patria points, then full-war store.
[43:24.000 --> 43:33.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about these compounds and ingredients for yourself and then try it for yourself.
[43:33.000 --> 43:38.000]  Now the formula is made for men, but it does amazing things for women as well.
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.000]  Find out what just one of the ingredients does, LJ100 and then go on from there.
[43:43.000 --> 43:50.000]  Alpha Power, exclusively available right now, 40% off at infowarstore.com and it funds the info war.
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.000]  You are really missing out if you don't experience what Alpha Power does.
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.000]  It has improved my life and so many others, just incredible levels.
[43:59.000 --> 44:07.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  If you are having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of,
[44:11.000 --> 44:16.000]  our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[44:16.000 --> 44:23.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[44:23.000 --> 44:28.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out,
[44:28.000 --> 44:33.000]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[44:38.000 --> 44:46.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees,
[44:46.000 --> 44:49.000]  who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[44:49.000 --> 44:55.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[44:55.000 --> 45:09.000]  Sell it out now at www.infowarstore.com
[45:26.000 --> 45:33.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[45:33.000 --> 45:39.000]  that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030,
[45:39.000 --> 45:42.000]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[45:42.000 --> 45:49.000]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[45:49.000 --> 45:53.000]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[45:53.000 --> 45:57.000]  That's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[45:57.000 --> 45:59.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[45:59.000 --> 46:07.000]  I designed over 200 t-shirts the last 25 years and we have some of those original designs still for sale at infowarstore.com.
[46:07.000 --> 46:08.000]  These are real classics.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, they're all about to be limited edition because we're selling out of them.
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.000]  They're about to be history and we're selling out of the hoodies, the ball caps, the t-shirts,
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.000]  the sizing designs at cost infowarstore.com except for this fundraiser shirt that is a real hit and people love it.
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.000]  It's $24.95. Alex Jones is right on the front, the Red Thunderbolt, and then again on the back, a big bold infowars.com.
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  Exercise your First Amendment.
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.000]  Don't let the leftist and the globalist bully, silence you and fund the info war at the same time.
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.000]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom, resistance to the new world order
[46:46.000 --> 46:50.000]  and Alex Jones was right shirt exclusively available at infowarsstore.com
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  and again, this shirt is limited edition as well.
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  We're doing one more run and then no more.
[46:55.000 --> 47:17.000]  infowarsstore.com, get yours today.
[47:17.000 --> 47:25.000]  They showed me an excerpt. He said, a 22-calibre boy who lies in a lung,
[47:25.000 --> 47:29.000]  and we can probably get it out, you may be able to get it and save the life.
[47:29.000 --> 47:34.000]  A 9-millimeter boy who blows the lung out of the body.
[47:34.000 --> 47:43.000]  So the idea of this high-calibre weapon is that there is simply no rational basis for it
[47:43.000 --> 47:48.000]  in terms of what you see about self-protection on him.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  I mean, I guess one number.
[47:51.000 --> 47:57.000]  The constitution of the second number is never absolute.
[47:57.000 --> 48:02.000]  So a 9-millimeter round, he says, is a high-powered round.
[48:02.000 --> 48:12.000]  Now of course this is a false dichotomy, a false debate that a bullet shouldn't be designed for self-defense to stop somebody or kill somebody.
[48:12.000 --> 48:17.000]  That's the case, the Secret Service, I guess should use BB guns.
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.000]  Or how about Nerf guns?
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  You don't need something that actually has force to protect yourself, right?
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  But then the lie goes further.
[48:29.000 --> 48:40.000]  Anybody that knows anything about guns knows that the 9-millimeter is a very weak round compared to almost all other rounds.
[48:40.000 --> 48:47.000]  But the Germans popularized it in their Lugers in World War II and it got picked up because it has a low recoil.
[48:47.000 --> 48:52.000]  The magazines can fill a lot of rounds.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  The police like them in MP5, H&Ks.
[48:57.000 --> 49:20.000]  But you can see on screen there a.22 caliber of your TV viewer, next to it a 9-millimeter, then a 10-millimeter, then a.357 magnum, a 5.7, a.556.
[49:20.000 --> 49:35.000]  The.223 they demonized so much, a.6.5 Creedmoor, a.308, and a.50 Cal BMG.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  How many people are murdered each year with.50 Cal BMGs?
[49:39.000 --> 49:46.000]  In the last several decades it's three people.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.000]  It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[49:50.000 --> 49:53.000]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[49:53.000 --> 50:01.000]  Now what really matters is not even so much the size of the round, but the velocity.
[50:01.000 --> 50:10.000]  And I'm not going to get into all the ballistics because I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I know which gun to use and which rifle to use when I'm doing what.
[50:10.000 --> 50:18.000]  But if you take that Creedmoor round, it's a very flat shooting, long-range bullet, but it's very small.
[50:18.000 --> 50:23.000] .308 is what NATO used, very accurate, but has a drop to it.
[50:23.000 --> 50:35.000]  The.556 or.223 deployed in Vietnam is lightweight, low recoil, and is high velocity, so it causes a lot of damage.
[50:35.000 --> 50:51.000]  And I can tell you the difference between a 10mm and a 9mm is massive because I've got 10mm rifles, the same brand.
[50:51.000 --> 51:01.000]  And the power when you're shooting anything is just dramatically increased, but 10mm is not a popular round.
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Most people don't have 10mm handguns or 10mm rifles.
[51:05.000 --> 51:19.000]  People buy what the media popularized, and once a mass shooter uses a.556 or.223, everybody then wants the Bushmaster or they want the AR-15 variant, the M4.
[51:19.000 --> 51:29.000]  And so the crazies, when they hear about all this going on, they go out and buy the gun they hear mass shooters use because they're all very impressionable because what are they doing in criminology?
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.000]  Copycatting, copycatting.
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.000]  And until Columbine where they used.556, you didn't have any mass shootings with them.
[51:42.000 --> 51:57.000]  But if you're saying ban what's being used in mass shootings, statistically still, the biggest year of mass shootings was 118 in this nation.
[51:57.000 --> 52:00.000]  Compared to everything else, it is a mirage.
[52:00.000 --> 52:06.000]  But the whole world is a stage, each of us players upon it, and that's what they're doing.
[52:06.000 --> 52:19.000]  So when he says that a 9mm blows your lung out of your body, that is the most ridiculous load of crap I have ever heard.
[52:19.000 --> 52:28.000]  9mm, if you shoot somebody in the chest, rarely go through.
[52:28.000 --> 52:48.000]  A.308, or a heavier round that almost no one uses in crimes because it hasn't been advertised as a thing to use, will blow a hole right through a 400 pound wild hug.
[52:48.000 --> 52:55.000]  That's the reality.
[52:55.000 --> 53:05.000]  And I hate to even get up here on air and popularize what actually works for the crazies because the crazies just go with hype.
[53:05.000 --> 53:15.000]  It doesn't matter what bullet it is or what rifle or gun it is, it's the worm-eaten satanic brains of people out there.
[53:15.000 --> 53:24.000]  And this stuff didn't exist 30 years ago, or was extremely rare like the UT shooting, and now compare it is an epidemic.
[53:24.000 --> 53:32.000]  If you compare it, it didn't exist 50, 60 years ago, and now it does happen a few times a year and it's wrong.
[53:32.000 --> 53:42.000]  But it's a smoke screen while the elite themselves are robbing a spline with insider trading, collapsing our borders, allowing mass murder on the border, huge human trafficking,
[53:42.000 --> 53:57.000]  pumping massive amounts of money into Ukraine for hundreds of thousands to die while they turn around and tell you a gun owner, a single mom, or a business owner,
[53:57.000 --> 54:04.000]  a convenience store operator that you're bad when somebody else does something bad.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  That is just outrageous on its face, and I know as an audience you're smart and you get that, but we need to get out there and get the word out to the sheeple.
[54:11.000 --> 54:20.000]  Because let me tell you, while we're winning the Second Amendment fight, why they want to hurry up and finish it up and get defeated.
[54:20.000 --> 54:29.000]  If you go to any big gun shop or small gun shop around the country, they'll tell you more of their customers are leftists now than they used to be conservatives buying.
[54:29.000 --> 54:33.000]  The left is getting guns because they thought they'd have a civil war with Trump.
[54:33.000 --> 54:37.000]  They also know crimes exploding. They don't trust the system anymore to protect them.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  And they're out buying guns and they're shooting guns and they're thinking, why didn't I do this before?
[54:41.000 --> 54:48.000]  And they're meeting normal people at the gun ranges and they're becoming more libertarian and they're waking up.
[54:48.000 --> 54:51.000]  And this is a huge conversion happening.
[54:51.000 --> 55:01.000]  Every liberal I've known since childhood is now a Trump, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson listener, black, white, old, young.
[55:01.000 --> 55:12.000]  And so the system is flipping out and they're admitting in national headlines that leftists are the fastest growing group of gun owners and something even better.
[55:12.000 --> 55:22.000]  Law-abiding good black folks and Hispanic folks that culturally and historically haven't gone out and bought guns and northerners
[55:22.000 --> 55:30.000]  and people that didn't have a gun culture are going out and getting guns in the areas where they have higher gun ownership.
[55:30.000 --> 55:36.000]  Crime drops like a lead balloon.
[55:36.000 --> 55:42.000]  So yeah, they demonize conservatives in a big national study saying people are buying guns because they don't trust people.
[55:42.000 --> 55:50.000]  You mean criminals? You mean the government to protect you?
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  It's amazing.
[55:53.000 --> 56:00.000]  You know, I told people decade plus ago that Keanu Reeves was a awake person.
[56:00.000 --> 56:06.000]  I know because I've had dinner with him and hung out with him and in a film with him and consulted on it.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  He's a listener of the show. Now you can see how he's hardcore publicly.
[56:10.000 --> 56:18.000]  I told you two years ago, Joe Rogan said, you know, I apologize, you were right about all this, I've woken up and I just didn't believe the system was this evil, you're right.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  And I told you, watch the transformation because he's very smooth how he does things.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  Now he's out to defend the Second Amendment to the Hill.
[56:26.000 --> 56:31.000]  And I only put this out to you to not say, look how important I am.
[56:31.000 --> 56:38.000]  I want you to realize how important you are because the best hope we've got of beating these people is this broadcast.
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.000]  This broadcast changed the world and that means you changed the world.
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  And I salute you and thank you before we start the second hour.
[56:44.000 --> 56:52.000]  We got so much next hour, it just happened. The rig jury, full of Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party operatives,
[56:52.000 --> 56:57.000]  acquitted assessment on charge brought by special counsel Durham.
[56:57.000 --> 57:06.000]  We've got massive big pharma news on the COVID front, the new monkeypox lockdowns, and so much more coming up.
[57:06.000 --> 57:14.000]  We have a special guest for the third hour, but I intend to open the phones up specifically on the topic of Justin Trudeau
[57:14.000 --> 57:19.000]  and Biden tipping his hand that they are going to go after, and that's the key issue at the start of the segment,
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  they're going to go after the ammunition, they're going to try to ban calibers now.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  And that's been announced, they've done that in other countries, the Democrats have proposed it in California, other areas.
[57:28.000 --> 57:36.000]  So that's the moral of all that BS you just heard from Biden is they are coming for your calibers
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  and pretending like if a gun can kill somebody it's illegal when that's the whole damn point of them,
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  as a deterrent or to defend yourself in the last ditch operation.
[57:44.000 --> 58:13.000]  They'll be back with hour number two in FullWars.com, tomorrow's news.
[58:13.000 --> 58:19.000]  It has since become a symbol of defiance here in America along with the imagery of a black star and cannon
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  in the flag used by Texans during the state's revolution against Mexico.
[58:23.000 --> 58:27.000]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase,
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.000]  with one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of come and take it
[58:32.000 --> 58:38.000]  and the reverse side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription free men bear arms.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  Go to 1776coin.com today to secure your founding member coin.
[58:43.000 --> 59:09.000]  Hurry before they're gone as there will only be 10,000 in existence.

[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  It's our first big run.

[59:43.000 --> 59:52.000]  you name it with Redux exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[59:52.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  In Davos, Switzerland, Klaus Schwab and his fellow wannabe tyrants have come out into the open as the arbiters of world government.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  They are openly calling for world war in the end of national sovereignty and they openly acknowledge that they must move quickly to be victorious.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  Many are celebrating the fact that the people of Sri Lanka are rising up against their corrupt politicians,
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  burning their homes and destroying city property.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  But this is nothing to celebrate. This is exactly what the World Economic Forum is hoping for.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:26.000]  They want governments to be destroyed and the people to lose all faith in the nation state.
[1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  Their plan is to starve the people into destroying their own governments so they can act as saviors.
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  It is important for Americans to realize that the current administration is not failing at all.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  They are accomplishing exactly what they set out to do.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  They did not steal the 2020 election to secure power.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  They did it to destroy America and destabilize the entire system and they are rapidly succeeding.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  The voices calling for violence are as ignorant and mad as they sound.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  Violence towards who? How will you organize? And who are you going to fight?
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Your brainwashed sheep neighbors?
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  That is exactly what the globalists want you to do.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  And if your plan is to wait until they come to your door, then you'll just be a dangerous animal in a cave on someone else's private property.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  But there are solutions. For example, before passing in March of 2022,
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  the great Jordan Maxwell's last project was to save America from global governance with America 21.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  America 21's mission is to gut the system of globalist interference and reclaim all of America by 2025
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  so that we can rebuild our agriculture, production and energy and become a self-sufficient nation that serves the people.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  America 21 is calling for a complete withdrawal from all treaties and influences of the United Nations and World Economic Forum.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  Washington DC is just a symbol of our old corrupt federal government.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  The new world leaders are living abroad and the only way they can control us is through the compliance of our local governments.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  According to America 21, your focus needs to be where you live, in your county and city.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  Global governance ultimately depends on your county being taken over.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  This is where you need to resist now.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  This is how the United Nations and the globalists have been doing it and it's the only way to properly reverse it.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  America 21 has been having success in Montana and they freely share their working model and support at america21century.com
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  such as learning what language to look for in your local governments to detect UN initiatives and protocols being deployed by your local officials.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Key words such as 2030, sustainable development and carbon neutral.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Your local officials have to live with you and in most cases will prefer to keep their jobs.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Our voting system may be broken but our elected officials still work for us and if enough of us come together
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  we can put the pressure on them to renounce global governance and to serve the will of the people.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  This is the law of the land. It really is just that simple. But we have to come together and get active.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  Americans have a choice. We can either take action to purge the system of corrupt politicians and their thugs
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  or we can stop complaining about them and be good slaves.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  Alright my friends, we're going to go to break. We spent the whole first hour on the gun confiscation
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  starting in Canada under the World Economic Forum's control.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  We're going to get all the other big news when we come back in 60 seconds to tell you about this.
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  FreeWorldOutlet.com is amazing. We're partnered with them and things like DNA Force Plus
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  that have been sold out at Infowars Store is available there.

[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  FreeWorldOutlet.com and keep Infowars in the air while getting great products.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Michael Obama's third administration puppet.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Biden has come out and said, yeah, they're looking at banning high powered ammo like 9mm.
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  This is even high powered. It's weak.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  Kamala Harris says, time to ban all semi-autos.
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  Canada announces a freeze on selling and transferring any handguns ahead of confiscation.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  Unbelievable information, but now I want to hit a bunch of other news
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  and then come back at the bottom of the hour.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  I'm going to give the number out. We'll take six, seven calls in the last two segments of the hour.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  On your view on Trudeau and the WEF puppet carrying out their agenda of banning free speech,
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  coming after the guns, and Klaus Schwab bragging in an earlier clip that he is directly under his command.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  I mean, this is just insane. If we're on the Democratic Party, he uses all the same nomenclature.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:18.000]  They follow the same directives, the same scripts. This is global government staring us in the face
[1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  in Klaus Schwab bragged last Monday. We played the clip probably ten times.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  That the WEF is in control of the major governments and that they rule the world.
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  And they went on to say, we're going to censor you. We're going to take over your bodies.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  We're going to disarm you. We're going to make you obsolete.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  We're going to make you live in your house in the metaverse. It's all been announced.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Moving so incredibly quickly right now and where are our leaders even talking about it?
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Well, they're starting to some, Senator Paul and others, but this should be the number one issue
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  of an outside multinational corporate combine exerting its power over the world
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  and preparing new lockdowns that they wore game to year ago for May and June
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  to roll out the monkeypox with the lockdowns implemented in August.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  Now, that's their plan. It's all scripted like your idiots.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  They got to script it and prepare it and they just think you won't notice.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  They ordered the vaccine before they wore game at all.
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  Unbelievable. We've got some big news, huge news on that front.
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  But first, let me give you the number.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Alex 877-789-2539 first on callers on one topic.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  The gun grab, Canada, the W.E.F. in control of it.
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  What do you think is coming next?
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  And you understand that I'm telling you that they do intend to try major gun confiscation in this country
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  to try to trigger a civil war as they want to collapse the United States.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  That's why we need to be non-violent and not let them push us into a confrontation
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  because they've already stolen the last election, they plan on stealing the midterms
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  and they plan on triggering violence.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  If we can keep from being violent back, at least in the first phase,
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  it'll cause an even bigger realignment and you'll see more leaders in Congress,
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  more governors than others fully energize and stand up and our victory will be assured.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  They'll have their own people turn against them, whistleblowers you name it.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  There are a lot of people in the establishment that know the globalists have this plan
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  and think it's just too dangerous to try to execute.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  They don't know for it, but they think they're failing and that gambling like this is dangerous.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  And so the new world order is very, very weak in their own internal documents.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  They admit that so your calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Love to hear from Canadians, particularly you'll go to the head of the line at 877-789-2539.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I see the first call come in as Craig from Canada, I thought, oh yeah, obviously Canadians.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  We'll put you ahead of the line, 877-789-2539, what is your view of the situation?
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Okay, let's move quickly through a bunch of other news.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  Talk about lawlessness in the government, talk about above the law.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Sussman lied to the FBI, Sussman took fake documents created by Hillary Clinton,
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  gave them to them to try to then get Trump's spy on which they did
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  and to get billions of dollars of CIA funding to use domestically against the American people.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Sussman acquitted on charge brought by special counsel Durham,
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  the jury that had a bunch of people that actually worked for Obama and Hillary,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  not just voters, but actually worked for them.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  The jury acquitted, Michael Sussman, 57, are charges that he lied when he allegedly denied
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  he was acting on behalf of any client and alerting the FBI to claims that a secret server linked Trump to a Moscow bank.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  He was all fake, they knew it was fake, he said it wasn't paid for,
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  he said it wasn't the Democratic Party, he filed a fake report and fake dossier
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and of course the higher-ups, the FBI knew this, they've come out and defended Sussman, this is disgusting.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Ex-Clinton campaign lawyer, Sussman, not guilty in Trump-Russia trial,
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  a green light for them to engage in even more criminal activity.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  Absolutely insane that that is going on.
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.000]  Now let's look at this stat.
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccination status,
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  injected himself with saltwater instead, now facing criminal charges along with hundreds of other celebrities,
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  who by the way pushed the shots.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  This is in Spain, which is a total police state,
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  never came out of martial law under Franco, very, very sad.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccination status,
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  injecting himself with saltwater instead.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  While the WHO and our political leaders want us to trust the COVID vaccines
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  and push for legal measures to force it upon us,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  it seems even big pharma executives don't even trust the safety of the facts.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  I talked to a billionaire, well-known owner of a biotech company in person, ran into him,
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  didn't know who they were at the time and looked him up.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Big scientist.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Two years ago, he said, don't take that vaccine.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  It'll destroy your immune system.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  And more.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Spanish actress investigated for buying fraudulent COVID pass.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  That's your global pass.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  The president of Pharma Mar, more than 2,200,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  who falsely vaccinated with COVID.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  They're talking about arresting hundreds.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Many questions remain over the false COVID-19 vaccine certificates
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  bought by stars, sports personalities, and business leaders.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  Meanwhile, Fauci, it's revealed, had a war game of the mousepox being released
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  shortly before it began spreading in the global outbreak.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  And his answer, of course, forced inoculation.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  He got a $10 million grant to run the pheromondering program.
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  So Tom Cruise was right to giving kids Ritalin and Adderall
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  and all these other dangerous drugs out of control.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  But what about the gene therapy shots?
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  They're giving five in-ups and causing heart attacks and so many problems.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Bill Gates says the next pandemic likely to be caused by climate change.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  It's going to come out of the jungle.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  It's your fault.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Not out of the labs he controls.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Told you that was coming.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  And some good news in the U.K.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  They've got big petitions that say, do not sign the WHO pandemic treaty
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  unless it is approved via public referendum.
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  Count Dankula is laying it out.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  Please explain to me how, again, democracy is power to the people.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  Now look at this one.
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  Report more than 3,000 diabetics in the U.K. died because of COVID lockdowns.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Hell, they were denying people basic medical care during all of that as well.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  All part of the death panels in their own words.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  This out of the Gateway Pundit, one of the largest egg factories in the U.S.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  torched in the middle of the night in the mid outbreak of fires
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  and food processing facilities across the nation.
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  On average, one is burning a day.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And you wonder why there's food shortages.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  And Royce White asked the question, we're at war.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  The question is whether the enemy is foreign or domestic.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  Well, who's shutting off the pipelines?
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Who's dissolving the borders?
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  Who's doing all of this?
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  I ask you that, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Now the big news, when we come back,
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  Russia threatens to wipe out the entire U.S.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  with just four Satan 2 missiles and chilling warning over Ukraine.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  And that ties into some other big news on that front.
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  Main Street media praises Ukraine as a battalion
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  for dropping Nazi patches from the uniform.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  That's the times of London.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Talk about surreal, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  You cannot make this up.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  More details of that when we come back
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  and also reports on who controls the World Health Organization.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  It's now admitted that Communist China controls the panel.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  They have now just elected another member
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  of the World Health Organization executive board with no objections.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  We'll be right back, my friends.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  This is the great reset.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.000]  What are you going to do about it?
[1:15:44.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  I'll tell you about it.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Inform everybody you know about the New World Order
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  and how it's their enemy and what's coming next.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  They're ready to listen.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are a lot of natural compounds out there
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  that turbocharge and boost our stamina, our energy,
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  our libido that are also amazing pre or post workouts.
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  And we went out and looked at the top brands,
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  the top reviews and came out with alpha power.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Now it's so hard to source good, clean herbs like we have in this
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  that it's been sold out for more than six months,
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  but now alpha power is back in stock at infowarstore.com at 40% off.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Go to infowarstore.com and read about these compounds
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  and ingredients for yourself and then try it for yourself.

[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  and override the sensors has been patriot apparel
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  so we can identify each other so we can spread the word
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,

[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  your drawer or your wardrobe.

[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  during their major takeover is because of you.

[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  first came out which is we thought,
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  we're going to level the playing field.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  and everybody's going to be able to freely communicate
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  that information. That's our goal,
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  to get back to that place
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  where we all have access to all of the information.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  We all have the ability to freely communicate
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  that information with whomever we want,
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  whenever we want,
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  and we don't have to worry about anybody
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  or categorize us
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  or figure out some way to go after us
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  because of the conversations we're having,
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  because of the internet searches that we're doing,
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  because of the discussions,
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  So that's our goal,
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  is to help people take back their freedom
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  by helping them to take back their privacy.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  And so that's really what we're trying to do
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  and so I hope that everybody listening
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  will check us out at boltowireless.com,
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  boltowireless.com leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  Well, I'm going to talk about it.
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  The strikes in Donetsk were not only
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  caused by the air defense missile
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  from the Soviet Union,
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  but also by the American GALVets.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  The American GALVets M3.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  Semyorka.
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  Russia threatens to wipe out the entire U.S. with just four Satan-2 missiles
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  and chilling warning over Ukraine.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  A chilling moment on Russian state TV on Monday saw
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  the host issue the latest in a long line of threats.
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  This time, warning Putin could, quote,
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  destroy the entire east coast of the U.S. with just two missiles.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  In footage from Russia's flagship propaganda show,
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  a member of Russian's parliament boasts about it in the nation's military might,
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  for also labeling two million Ukrainians as incurable.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  Russian propaganda declares World War III has already started
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  and terrifying Kremlin TV threat reads another headline.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  Meanwhile, here's the Times of London.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  Azov battalion drops neo-Nazi symbol exploited by Russian propagandists.
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  Talk about propagandists. It is a Nazi battalion.
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  They are Nazis at Hall Hitler,
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  and now they're the good guys.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  Isn't that just cute?
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  Mainstream media praises Ukraine's Azov battalion
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  for dropping Nazi patches from their uniforms.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  So that's where we are in the globalist proxy war,
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  and the neocons, the crazy leftists, wanted Biden
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  to transfer long-range missiles, heavy missiles to Ukraine.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Ukraine's already been attacking inside Russia,
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  and Biden did something smart, or whoever's handling him did,
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  and said no, and now his own party's calling him a traitor
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  because he doesn't want to send offensive weapons to the Ukrainians.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  So the Ukrainians, I guess the 60 billion the last couple months
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  isn't enough for the new 5 billion that they're demanding every single month.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  So pray for peace, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  That's where we are in the year 2022,
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  and I have to just ask all of you listening,
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  who do you think is destroying our country?
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  Who do you think is dismantling our nation?
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  Who do you think is carrying out the economic warfare?
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  Who do you think is pushing the transgenderism to break up the family?
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Is it the Russians, or is it the World Economic Forum
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  and the megacorporations?
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  Who's allied with the Communist Chinese, the World Economic Forum?
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  We see these headlines in the UK, we see these headlines here in the US,
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  this is out of the BBC.
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  Is this the end of retirement as we know it?
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  That's right.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  In the world of robots, in the world of the future,
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  you work more and you have less because of inflation.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Eurozone inflation reaches 8.1 in May.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  Russian oil exports in India jump 25 times.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  Russia starts cutting off gas than other ones,
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  and its government refuses to pay in rubles.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  Households worldwide wreck by soaring gas prices.
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  French economies shrink unexpectedly in the first quarter
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  amid surging inflation.
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  Lavarov, the Russian foreign minister, says,
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  West prevents Russian ships from docking at ports
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  to exacerbate the food crisis.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  Yeah, who shut down the baby formula factories?
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  The unpopular puppet of the New World Order,
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Joe Biden, and the list goes on and on.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  And looking at the attacks on our children,
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  there's got to be light at the end of the tunnel,
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  and there is, as governors and legislators pass laws saying,
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  don't talk to children about their sexual preference.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Don't talk to them about how they can beat other sex.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Don't do it until at least the eighth grade.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  And the answer is they say that they're banning the word gay,
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  and that's not what's happening.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  Our children are being targeted politically and sexually.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  Biden, Edmund, K-12 schools, that's five-year-olds,
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  and up must put boys in girls' bathrooms
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  to get federal lunch money.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  How perverted and sick and evil.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  Killing the classic division of the sexes
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  and the human dynamic and the mammalian dynamic.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  But there's good news.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  Doctors say the sky is blue.
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  Top doctors say trans swimmer has unfair advantage.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  A Paul Joseph Watson article.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  Top doctors told The New York Times that transgender swimmer,
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  Leah Thompson, had set an unfair advantage
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  over biological females despite the athlete having
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  undergone to test her own suppressing therapy.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  A transgender swimmer who was born a man,
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  stoked controversy after winning the 500-yard
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  NCAA Women's Championship in March.
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis responded by asserting
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  that the real winner was the biological female competitor
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  who came in second place.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  After entering female competitions,
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  Thomas says, showered international rankings,
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  soared international rankings,
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  jumping from the 20th, 30th second place
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  in men's meets to eighth in women.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  And it's moving up the chart.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  I mean, this is just asinine.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  And the answer is, create a trans league, they're saying.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  And of course, as they come out with human animal hybrids
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  and human splice hybrids that aren't really humanoids,
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  as people get their designer babies,
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  this is all just getting us ready for the whole
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  transhumanist revolution that is here,
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  that is using gender dysphoria and confusion
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  and mental illness as the pretext to take over society.
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  And I don't hate any men that think they're women.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  I don't hate anybody for what they do as adults,
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  as long as they don't hurt innocent people.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  And I'm not judging anybody.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  I was just on Blair White's first big podcast going viral now.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Very nice person, very smart, against the targeting of children.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  He's a genuine real person who's very nice
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  and I think a good person.
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  And I'm not judging Blair White any more
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  than I can judge anybody else.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  And so they try to say, oh, anybody that doesn't want
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  five-year-olds taught about this hates people.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  I don't want a five-year-old taught about heterosexual sex,
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  homosexual sex, any of this and be labeled by the state
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  and then put into a category where the state begins
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  to take parental rights from the parents
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  and prepare them to be sterilized, basically.
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  That's why you see in California upwards of half the children
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  say they're transgender. That is brainwashing.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  That is by design and it must end.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  with your phone calls on the Global Gun Grab run by the W-E-F

[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:50.000]  You are the tip of the spear.

[1:33:45.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  You are the tip of the spear.
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  You are the tip of the spear.

[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  In the next phase, we're launching.
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  It will stay on air and it looks like we will be able to.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  But regardless, you'll know you've been hardcore in the fight.
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  It's a key fundraiser.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  It's the third and final coin, the Second Amendment coin.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  It just so happened to come out.
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  We planned it six months ago, got minted a month ago, got delivered last Monday.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  So it's available exclusively at 1776coin.com.
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  Or there's a big banner at the top of InfoWareStore.com.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  Or go to patreoncollectibles.com.
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  The third and final coin in the series, I would get yours while they're still there.
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  We've also had a lot of requests to get the first coin and the second coin in the series.
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  We can't do that.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  These are collectors items.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  Many of them are selling for three, four times what they were previously.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  They're exclusive.
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  You'll be getting contacted via the email you leave.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  Some of you didn't even do that.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  You should hit us if you did, buy the coin.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  So what I'm saying to you is the coins are gone.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  Except we have 72 of the first two coins.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  Actually, we have 76 and 72, but we got us all in a set.
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  So next week, there'll be a limited offering of all three coins together.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  And then they're all completely gone except for two or three I kept for myself.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  So they will 100% be sold out next week in the three coins set.
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  We're waiting till we get down to 72 coins here.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  And we're almost 70% sold out of the Molan Lave Freeman Bear Arms Coin at 1776coin.com.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  Or you can call toll three, triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  Okay.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  Thanks for keeping the First Amendment on the air, fighting for people's freedoms worldwide
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  and expiring liberty on a planetary scale.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  Let's go to the callers in the order they're received from Canada.
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Craig in Canada under siege, which are those giant gun ban announcement,
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  which will follow up with confiscation.
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  It's the same formula.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:53.000]  Craig, what's your view on the situation?
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  So back in last November, I actually went to go get my PAL license to go take the safety courses and whatnot.
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And while I was there, the instructors advised all of us, they're like,
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  you should get your R-PAL right now at the same time.
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.000]  Because in a few months, Justin Trudeau is planning to take all this away.
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  And now it's happening.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  So they were basically right.
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  And it was coming and everyone needs to stand up and do what we got to do.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  Whatever that is.
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  And they always, they always do it in increments.
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  Well, he banned free speech.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  He held people that led the peaceful protest without bail.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  He said he wants to be a dictator.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  Obviously the evidence showed he stole the last election.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  He's insanely unpopular.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  He's barely still controlled parliament.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  Again, he lost the election American style.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  He didn't get 50% of the vote, but he got like 30.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  His party is almost out of power.
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  It was a referendum against him, but a lot of fraud came out.
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  So you need to beat the drum to recall him and have him removed
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  and have another emergency snap election.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  That is the answer.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  What do you think, Craig?
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Well, he can't even go around and campaign.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  He's too scared.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  He gets everywhere he goes.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  He goes to these like $1,000 plate dinners and he has to walk away
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  because there's too many people standing outside that don't want him there.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  That's right.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  He's chased around and yelled at and screamed at everywhere.
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  What really freaks out the left is half the folks aren't white yelling at him.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  So they try to say, oh, white supremacist like Trudeau.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  No, everybody hates him.
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  Exactly.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  All you got to do is look at the footage like the rebel news and stuff puts out
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  and it's people from all over the place.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Like I'm up in northern Alberta and you can't find a Trudeau supporter anywhere you go.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  God bless you, Craig.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  This is what dictators do because they're unpopular.
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  They try to disarm their slaves while they have taxpayers pay for their protection.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Jay in Canada than David in Canada.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  Jay, welcome.
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex?
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Good, sir.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  I just wanted to call and warn Americans what can happen when a liberal dictator's
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  in power and how much of a hypocrite he is.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  So basically, you know, he's taken away the guns from Canadians.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  But yet again, he gets rid of mandatory minimum for gun offenses.
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  So basically you can go rob someone with a gun and get out in a year instead of,
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  for instance, the mandatory minimum as in like five years.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  So what he does, everything he does is just a hypocrisy.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  Oh, it's always to increase crime and terrorize the public into accepting gun controls,
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  the same worldwide formula.
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Meanwhile, he goes to Ukraine and says,
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  hand everybody AK-47s with your taxpayer money and M16s, but you can't have a gun.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  It's ridiculous.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Yeah, and you know, what's even worse is we got even, you know,
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  there's so much far left politics in our government and we even had Jagmeet Singh,
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  the leader of the NDP party, propose a plan to get rid of our Canadian Armed Forces
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  to utilize that money for a more socialized program.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  So this is what I mean when you have dictators running your country that, you know,
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  they don't have the national interest for Canadians.
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Your own military came out earlier this year and said they leaked a document
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  that Trudeau was putting Chinese spies all in charge of the Canadian military.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  They were flying in our air force. It is unbelievable what this guy does.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  I don't know his way of thinking. Canadians are strong.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  We are strong-willed people. We love Americans.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  And, you know, what he's doing to this country is very sad.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  You know what, I hope Canadians wake up, but the problem is, I'm not just trying to face,
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  but it's mass migration too.
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  More than half the people that are coming into the country don't care about politics.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  They vote for the person that's helping them out. And this is what's leading up down this road.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  And it's dangerous.
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  That's right. We don't hate the people being brought in as refugees from the New World Order,
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  but they are being kept in control as a new permanent underclass
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  to out-vote the indigenous populations and take your liberties.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  Absolutely right. Great points, Jay.
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  David in Canada. David, you're on the air.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Hey, Joe, it's such a pleasure to speak to you. Long time listener.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  I've been listening to you since probably about 2008 after the housing bubble blew up
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  and took a lot of points from you then.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Made a lot of preparations.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  Took a bit of a hiatus for a few years and came back in 2020 when everything kind of hit the fan there
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  with regards to Canadian gun confiscation and all that.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  Despite popular American opinion, there's probably about a million gun owners in Canada
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  and at least 100,000 AR-15s.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  So back in 2020 when Justin Trudeau initially tried to do some sort of gun confiscation ban,
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  government intervention in that regard, he went after about 1,500 rifles including the AR-15.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  So there's a lot of gun owners up here that I don't think are handing back their firearms
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  and I don't think any of this new stuff is going to really cause anybody to turn in what they have.
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  Absolutely. It just shows the dictator inclination to take away speech, to take away guns
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  and then he literally takes orders from the WEF.
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  That's enough right there to remove him from office.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  Well, he's clearly not working for the best interest of Canada.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  He hasn't been since he was elected.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  I'd be surprised if many of the prime ministers in the past 20 years have been working in the best interest of Canada.
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  All parties are fraudulent at this point.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Well, he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. He's the party boy, the nice guy, friendly.
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  No, he's a globalist tool to set the president worldwide for getting rid of speech
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  and people's right to defense and for permanent lockdowns.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  The man is a globalist dictator in your country.
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Well, you're the perfect Manchurian candidate for this country.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  Remember, Hitler was elected. Absolutely. Hitler was elected.
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  Well, you think this will be a big wake-up call for Canadians?
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  I don't know. I live in a pretty blue area.
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  I don't see much like blue in regards to American politics.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  Well, David, thank you and be safe and God bless you.
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  Canada is a warning for all of us. A canary in the coal mine will be right back.
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:04.000]  Info Wars has made history. You have made history in your support of Info Wars.
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the censors has been

[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  Hey, I'm in my 60s and I did the work of 25-30 year olds
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.760]  And I worked them into the ground and you wanted to why and I've tested this and I've taken your b12
[1:45:26.760 --> 1:45:29.880]  And let me tell you when I don't take it. I pay a price
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:35.240]  I really do I take that b12 and I am electric man. I can run 10 miles
[1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:42.980]  I I do some pretty heavy work with a highway department and my friends will attest to the fact that yeah for a guy in his
[1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:49.400]  60s, you know pushing 70. I'm and I know I'm not just blowing smoke here the b12 saves my life
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:03.600]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones needs to support info wars and banned video
[1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:07.120]  You know the Bible says let another mouth praise you. I'm gonna do that right now
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:11.400]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:16.360]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez
[1:46:16.360 --> 1:46:22.480]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad the outer space because of Alex Jones including myself
[1:46:22.480 --> 1:46:26.940]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform
[1:46:26.940 --> 1:46:31.320]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:37.280]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and Tim cast the super Tim cast IRL
[1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:44.920]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones and banned video for granted because you don't know what you have until it's gone

[1:46:54.760 --> 1:47:04.800]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:22.440]  Welcome back the Alex Jones show. There's a new report up with video of it actually happening on info wars calm by Paul Joseph Watson
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:28.520]  Schools are making children eat bugs in climate change brainwashing experiment
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:32.240]  You will have nothing you will own nothing you will drink sewage
[1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:38.120]  You will eat bugs and now it's all over the news and making boys go into girls bathrooms
[1:47:38.440 --> 1:47:42.400]  Under the by administrations directives or they'll cut off federal funding the schools
[1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:48.960]  This is all an exercise in pure evil, but we are fighting back. I'm gonna go right back to your phone calls
[1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:56.040]  But I'm gonna say it again. It is your last chance to get one of the coins from the three-part founding member series at

[1:48:01.080 --> 1:48:08.000]  It is historic and it means you were the tip of the spear funding the resistance against the New World Order and keeping us on air

[1:48:21.680 --> 1:48:26.680]  And I'm working on getting Roger Stone on about the Sussman not guilty verdict because those lies
[1:48:28.080 --> 1:48:33.240]  Got him SWAT team and they were gonna put him in prison and they tried to set me up
[1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:42.680]  Incredible right now. Let's go to Gloria Gloria in Michigan. Thanks for calling
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:45.960]  Hi
[1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:51.920]  So, I guess my thing is is the only reason they're trying to take our guns is because they don't want you to fight back
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:53.920]  What's coming next?
[1:48:53.920 --> 1:48:57.480]  Um, well, you just said the big thing out loud. I mean, I mean, that's it
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:03.600]  Lockdowns total control martial law never letting you out of your house. That's their admitted plan
[1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:07.920]  So of course they want the guns because they know people will finally get desperate exactly
[1:49:09.040 --> 1:49:13.160]  Yeah, and I've been here since it again. I was hoping maybe you could put me in touch with Liberty man
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:16.680]  I have so much like from the beginning, you know, two years ago
[1:49:16.760 --> 1:49:22.680]  Witnessing it all in the nursing home and just the censorship online when people would try to tell you what's going on and
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:29.080]  So just everything that's happening leading up to the mark of the beast do the you know, like these are old enemies
[1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:31.080]  We've been fighting for a long time, you know
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.960]  And they're making the move lock you down not give you access to medical care block therapeutics
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:39.120]  Now let you see your old folks while they ship covid patients in
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:45.720]  Sensoring you silencing you and now coming for your guns coming for your children coming for your currency coming for your retirement
[1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:52.480]  Coming for everything and the great reset to collapse this and make us all poor so they can dictate the terms of our submission
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:49:56.040]  That's it. I'm not sure exactly
[1:49:57.040 --> 1:49:58.800]  Well, would you like to
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:50:01.280]  When we have whistleblowers on we can protect your identity
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:02.840]  We need to confirm who you are
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:06.880]  But if you like to send us information and come on as a guest and tell us what you saw in the nursing home
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:11.600]  We would we would love to have you on yes, like I said, I'm like you said it
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.760]  But I got like you know legal battles to fight and it's like we're all fighting how we can so yes, I would love to
[1:50:17.280 --> 1:50:19.280]  I have so much to share
[1:50:19.400 --> 1:50:21.640]  Beautiful we'll put you on hold God bless you Gloria
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:25.200]  See if she wants to come on as a guest and it's proof of that she works where she works
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:29.880]  We won't sit on air and then have her on as a whistleblower because I'm intending to do more of those shows
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:34.480]  We haven't done in like four or five months or open the phones up for people to tell their covid vaccine story
[1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:38.560]  Or what they witness in the nursing homes and medical centers incredible hours of nightmares
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:43.200]  We're not screening calls people are welcome to call them with their stories and how great it is
[1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:45.760]  No one calls in to say how good it is
[1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:51.440]  Gloria you'll be one of those special guests when we do that we'll be doing that some in the near future
[1:50:52.160 --> 1:50:54.160]  Hell, I might just do it tomorrow
[1:50:56.040 --> 1:51:00.080]  Incredible let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Georgia Jay or on the air go ahead
[1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:06.000]  Hey Alex Jones, man. God bless your brother. It's great to talk to you first-time caller long-time listener
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  I'm an eight-year Marine Corps veteran
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:12.680]  And I just want to tell you that when we recognize as the people that tyranny's here
[1:51:12.680 --> 1:51:16.600]  You know, I talked to oh and a few months ago and we talked about the storm being off the shore
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:21.280]  And now the storm is here. We see it in Canada. We see it around the world
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:27.520]  I've been into war zones where the citizens there did not have weapons and there was nothing they could do about us being there
[1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:30.320]  You know, what do we think they're gonna do?
[1:51:30.560 --> 1:51:35.800]  We're gonna do when when when they come here to put us in a concentration camp
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:41.040]  When what do you think the COVID lockdowns are those are the training wheels for permanent camps?
[1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:44.840]  They're building all over the world under you in direction including in America and
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:48.160]  Alex they're announcing it. I mean in our face
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:56.000]  Clouse fob the world economic form all of these jokers are standing up the grandstanding telling us that they are about to do this
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:52:00.560]  And we sit back in la la land worrying about the amber herd and Johnny depth
[1:52:01.000 --> 1:52:06.600]  Frickin trial, you know, we we were distracted by all these other things to keep us off track because here's the thing
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:10.880]  I see in the grocery stores. I'm in the construction business and I talked to suppliers
[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:16.400]  Alex we can't get electrical boxes for months to build new properties
[1:52:16.400 --> 1:52:22.360]  They have to order them six to eight months in advance in order to put the electrical box on the side of the house because of the demand
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:29.280]  We got grocery stores that are running out of food. Our our illusion of choice is going away
[1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:35.280]  They're telling you there's no more baby formula. They're announcing in your face and we're sitting there with with a head stuck in
[1:52:35.280 --> 1:52:39.760]  So I know we're not but the average American is sitting out. They're like, oh, it's okay. Nothing's wrong
[1:52:39.760 --> 1:52:45.640]  And coming to China building giant million person camps is the example and now Canada the US
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:50.800]  Australia New Zealand Europe are building permanent camps, which are really going to be for political prisoners
[1:52:50.800 --> 1:52:56.440]  They now admit they are they are they are they are coming with an economic collapse hoping we just surrender and
[1:52:57.400 --> 1:53:01.160]  Alex I believe everything that they've done from an AI standpoint, you know
[1:53:01.160 --> 1:53:08.160]  If you look up the charts of 6g and you can see what 6g is going to bring 6g being the implant implants
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:15.160]  That's what powers that 5g was for, you know, the infrastructure for the industry the cars that all that, you know
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:17.840]  Tesla is not a car company. It's the data collection company
[1:53:17.840 --> 1:53:21.720]  Social media is nothing more than a data collection company
[1:53:21.720 --> 1:53:26.600]  You've talked about this 10 years ago where they would put your information in packets and they've got you set aside
[1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:34.840]  They know exactly what you want. It was to train the coming AI that will be the anti Christ in my opinion spirit
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  That will tell people
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:41.840]  How they feel and actually tell you how you feel before you even feel it
[1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:48.800]  It's going to know what you are how you work the pilots in the Air Force they train with AI they sit next to it
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:56.040]  Alex while the AI is learning what they do the Air Force announced that as soon as that AI can put fly just like a pilot
[1:53:56.200 --> 1:53:57.920]  The pilots are gone
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:53:59.920]  There they've announced this last year
[1:53:59.920 --> 1:54:02.720]  It's not innovation because the globalist will be in control of the
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:08.680]  Technocracy and their armies of robots will be locked in our houses forced into the metaverse that the WEF announced
[1:54:08.680 --> 1:54:13.400]  They run it is a nightmare matrix takeover forcing us in to the matrix
[1:54:14.080 --> 1:54:18.040]  So Alex Jones when it comes down to the gun grabs people of America
[1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:22.040]  You had better purchase a firearm whether you like firearms or not
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:28.520]  You better go get one and have it in your house to protect you and I would advise people with the left really wants to shut down
[1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.520]  as gun shows where you
[1:54:31.240 --> 1:54:36.280]  ATF is at these trying to say I'm a gun dealer, but I'm gonna sell you this off record. That's illegal
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:41.920]  But private sellers. They're selling their private gun. You're allowed to buy it from them if you're not a felon
[1:54:41.920 --> 1:54:47.440]  So make sure you follow the laws, but particularly people need to get guns that are not on the radar
[1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:55.080]  And when we have taxation without representation right now, which is should be at a glaring alarm to everybody in America
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:55:01.560]  When you have representatives in this in this this country in our government all the way down to the sheriffs
[1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:09.320]  Who are who are not protecting their oath? I'm going into my next city council meeting and I'm gonna demand that every one of them
[1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:16.560]  Swear and retake their oath of office. If not, they need to resign immediately and by the way Jay
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:23.760]  Jay what you're saying is absolutely key if everybody goes into city councils with particularly veterans and lays out this martial law
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:26.800]  Takeover the WEF and demands they swear allegiance to the republic
[1:55:26.800 --> 1:55:32.080]  It'll wake up the public the videos will go viral. So when you do it, send us the video at showtipsandinfullwars.com
[1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.920]  Everybody should be doing that now. It's one of the best venues to get the word out for the average person. God bless you
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:43.160]  Don't need internet don't need infrastructure. Nothing. Just go speak at county commissions city council school boards
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:47.800]  They're so scared of you doing that one more call Don in Ohio. Don. Thanks for holding
[1:55:48.840 --> 1:55:51.120]  But no problem. How are you doing? I'm all right
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.400]  All right, so I'm following about the Justin Trudeau gun grab. So here's what I think
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:56:00.720]  We always have what America has a plan to do a test run
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:06.440]  Well, obviously enter the test run right now. You can see how things go and obviously it's gonna come here
[1:56:06.640 --> 1:56:11.200]  Here's what I think our left wing politicians and media are forgetting about
[1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:16.400]  There's a lot of getting there to be Cleveland and live by them all and they're all catching Wednesdays
[1:56:16.400 --> 1:56:22.240]  They're all hearing about your show. I see guys that I would never expect listening to your show
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:25.880]  And they know who you are. I mean, they know everything you talk about. I
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:31.480]  Think these guys are gonna be the way that Americans group up together and organize
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:37.840]  And I don't think they're gonna wait. You know when I do we ask them, you know, what's the plan? They want fighting out
[1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:40.320]  So what do we do?
[1:56:40.320 --> 1:56:43.840]  If they do it before we do it if it gets out of control
[1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:50.040]  And these guys really do something like that. Well, that's cause one point is to make things so insane
[1:56:50.040 --> 1:56:51.680]  Everybody just gets confused and gives up
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:56.760]  Then they're gonna bring in the new world castle society the robots the universal basic income. It's all been announced

[1:59:28.520 --> 1:59:34.440]  There is not a more politically incorrect shirt that sends a stronger message of freedom resistance to the new world order

[2:00:01.840 --> 2:00:04.840]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak
[2:00:04.840 --> 2:00:10.040]  You think just let me sit back even now orders of being sheltered into telephones and men with guns
[2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:12.680]  Be on their way
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:17.680]  That's why because while the truncheon may be used Lou of conversation
[2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:24.560]  Words will always retain their power words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen
[2:00:24.720 --> 2:00:26.720]  The enunciation
[2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:33.080]  There is something terrible wrong with this country isn't that you designed it sir
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:36.880]  You wanted it foolproof you told me every television and longer cruelty and injustice
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:43.200]  Intolerance and aggression and where once you have the freedom to object to the thing can speak as you saw fit
[2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:45.680]  You now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[2:00:46.080 --> 2:00:50.880]  Pissing your conformity and so getting your submachine cameras. How did this happen?
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:53.040]  Who's to blame?
[2:00:53.040 --> 2:00:55.840]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  They will be held accountable
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.720]  But again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:11.440]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease
[2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:18.120]  There were a myriad problems inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:24.480]  Fear got the best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor Adam Sutler
[2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:34.040]  He promised you order he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent to obedient consent
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:40.680]  There is a war it's happening now
[2:01:41.240 --> 2:01:45.760]  It will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:54.080]  We are the resistance. We are the info war
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:00.760]  In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century
[2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:16.420]  Don't tell your supporters. Don't be afraid of coven everyone should be afraid of coven
[2:02:17.120 --> 2:02:22.920]  Don't tell your supporters don't be afraid of coven everyone should be afraid of coven
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:27.360]  Everyone should be afraid
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:29.360]  It came in peace.
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:32.360]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[2:02:32.360 --> 2:02:35.360]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:38.360]  And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad,
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:41.360]  we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free.
[2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  And especially if you're a senior, we're going to get...
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:45.360]  Huh?
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:02:59.360]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:01.360]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:03.360]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[2:03:09.360 --> 2:03:11.360]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:12.360]  CNN.
[2:03:12.360 --> 2:03:16.360]  As a young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:20.360]  half of this government are actually young nobleness of the world.
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.360]  It's that we penetrate the cabinets.
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:26.360]  The change is not just happening.
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:31.360]  The change can be shaped by us.
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:34.360]  We have to prepare for a more angry world,
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:39.360]  how to prepare to take the necessary action to create the fair world.
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:42.360]  I see the need for a great reset.
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:49.360]  and everything will be normal again.
[2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:52.360]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:54.360]  It will not happen.
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:03:58.360]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:07.360]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario
[2:04:07.360 --> 2:04:12.360]  of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:21.360]  Our society has a hold.
[2:04:21.360 --> 2:04:27.360]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:37.360]  as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:02.360]  FreeWorldOutlet.com

[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:25.360]  And lying to the FBI.
[2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:30.360]  Here's Trump's statement on Truth Social.
[2:06:30.360 --> 2:06:32.360]  Our legal system is corrupt.
[2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  Our judges and justices are highly partisan.
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:37.360]  Compromise are just plain scared.
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:38.360]  Our borders are open.
[2:06:38.360 --> 2:06:39.360]  Our elections are rigged.
[2:06:39.360 --> 2:06:40.360]  Inflation is rampant.
[2:06:40.360 --> 2:06:42.360]  Gas prices and food costs are through the roof.
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:44.360]  Our military leadership is woke.
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:45.360]  Our country's going to hell.
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:47.360]  And Michael Sussman is not guilty.
[2:06:47.360 --> 2:06:49.360]  How's everything else doing?
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:54.360]  Enjoy your day.
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:57.360]  And we've given $60 billion to Nazis.
[2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:02.360]  As a battalion drops an EO Nazi symbol exploited by Russian propagandists.
[2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:05.360]  Oh.
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:07.360]  Incredible.
[2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:09.360]  But he's been a very busy man.
[2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:11.360]  I've been trying to get him on for two weeks,
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:16.360]  but he's been so busy with the big law firms they've got across the United States
[2:07:16.360 --> 2:07:19.360]  have been to their offices in Los Angeles.
[2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:22.360]  There's five, six beautiful floors of CPAs and lawyers.
[2:07:22.360 --> 2:07:27.360]  And what's so important about this is the system created loopholes
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:30.360]  when they passed the income tax in 1913.
[2:07:30.360 --> 2:07:32.360]  And they changed it every couple of years.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:34.360]  Where when you hear about Jeff pays those,
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:38.360]  pays zero taxes, but makes $30 billion a year.
[2:07:38.360 --> 2:07:41.360]  Or when you hear Elon Musk getting criticized,
[2:07:41.360 --> 2:07:42.360]  he wasn't paying taxes.
[2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:44.360]  He said, all right, well, all the other billionaires aren't.
[2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:47.360]  But I'll go ahead and pay $16 billion.
[2:07:47.360 --> 2:07:49.360]  Because I want jobs in America.
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:07:51.360]  He actually builds factories here.
[2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:52.360]  I'm saying he's perfect.
[2:07:52.360 --> 2:07:56.360]  And you read about Google pays 1% tax in all of this.
[2:07:56.360 --> 2:07:59.360]  They've got it all set up where they basically pay nothing.
[2:07:59.360 --> 2:08:01.360]  Now, if you don't write the laws,
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:05.360]  you don't get the same thing they get where they write them for themselves.
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  But there's the next level right below that.
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.360]  And you can go to law firms and pay them huge amounts of money
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:14.360]  and they do this assessment and drag them on for months and charge you huge amounts of money.
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:20.360]  The reason we have American tax solutions is because they give great advice.
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:21.360]  They look at your returns.
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:25.360]  They look at your history and quickly in days or a week or so,
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:29.360]  give you an answer and sign on to it so you're protected.
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:31.360]  It's not just tax forgiven.
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:33.360]  It's not just getting your tax bill cut by 90%.
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:34.360]  It's not just getting your passport back.
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:37.360]  If you've got back taxes and they revoked it.
[2:08:37.360 --> 2:08:41.360]  It's hundreds of services that they've got and I use them.
[2:08:41.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  They're great.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.360]  And again, they cut to the chase and then give you a letter,
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  signed that they stand behind it.
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  And then you're protected, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:53.360]  This is so important.
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:55.360]  So I was sitting here two weeks ago and I said, I want you on.
[2:08:55.360 --> 2:08:58.360]  He said, listen, I'm having to hire more people.
[2:08:58.360 --> 2:08:59.360]  We're going all over.
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:02.360]  They were already hiring before we got them as a sponsor.
[2:09:02.360 --> 2:09:04.360]  They've got people like Sean Hannity.
[2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.360]  You name it as folks promoting.
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:07.360]  So they've been around a long time.
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:08.360]  They're big folks.
[2:09:08.360 --> 2:09:09.360]  That's why I knew they were.
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:10.360]  I knew they had a great record.
[2:09:10.360 --> 2:09:11.360]  That's why I reached out to them.
[2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:13.360]  They're like, yeah, we're listeners.
[2:09:13.360 --> 2:09:16.360]  Yeah, we love to work with you, Alex.
[2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:21.360]  And so Tyler Bennett is a tax professional lawyer and the owner
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:23.360]  operator of tax from America tax solutions.
[2:09:23.360 --> 2:09:26.360]  When you go to Jones taxrelief.com, it's their same website,
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:27.360]  same services.
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:30.360]  Then they can just gauge the sponsorship,
[2:09:30.360 --> 2:09:32.360]  whether they're going to up the sponsorship or keep it the same.
[2:09:32.360 --> 2:09:35.360]  And they've been up in their sponsorship before we had those
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:36.360]  Bitcoin donations.
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:39.360]  We would not have been able to make payroll without their
[2:09:39.360 --> 2:09:40.360]  sponsorship.
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:43.360]  So Tyler Bennett doesn't just have great services that will save
[2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:46.360]  you a massive amount of money, but so quick and easy.
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:49.360]  But it then keeps this broadcast on the air.
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:51.360]  So it's a 360 win.
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:53.360]  A symbiotic relationship.
[2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:56.360]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL.
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:09:58.360]  Jones taxrelief.com.
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:04.360]  One word, Jones taxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:08.360]  833-900-4285.
[2:10:08.360 --> 2:10:10.360]  We'll put that URL on screen.
[2:10:10.360 --> 2:10:15.360]  Jones taxrelief.com.
[2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:19.360]  And again, they've had thousands and thousands and thousands of people
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  call them get their services.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:21.360]  That's great.
[2:10:21.360 --> 2:10:22.360]  We have millions of listeners an hour.
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:26.360]  I don't care if you work at a cafeteria or pump gas or whether
[2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:31.360]  you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:36.360]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:37.360]  You see it every year.
[2:10:37.360 --> 2:10:40.360]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.360]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:10:42.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:51.360]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:55.360]  show.
[2:10:55.360 --> 2:10:58.360]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things
[2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:03.360]  out there hurting everybody to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:05.360]  and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:09.360]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:10.360]  few years.
[2:11:10.360 --> 2:11:13.360]  And so this is so important for everybody and I want you to be
[2:11:13.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  successful.
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:15.360]  I want you to save money.
[2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:18.360]  I don't want you to be bankrupt like the globalists want us all to be
[2:11:18.360 --> 2:11:20.360]  and on their universal basic income.
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:23.360]  So knowing their tricks, knowing their loopholes is beyond critical.
[2:11:23.360 --> 2:11:26.360]  We've got a bunch of current examples of this and a bunch of news.
[2:11:26.360 --> 2:11:29.360]  We're going to be going over with Tyler Bennett joining us today.
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:32.360]  Tyler, thank you so much for coming on today.
[2:11:32.360 --> 2:11:34.360]  Great to be here, Alex, back on the show.
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  And you know what?
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:40.360]  There's those three trifecta of things that the government has and the
[2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:41.360]  globalists have out against you.
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:46.360]  It's inflation and as you mentioned, it is the control, the war on
[2:11:46.360 --> 2:11:49.360]  information of knowledge so that you don't have the information you need
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:51.360]  to make the informed decision.
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:54.360]  And then as one of the people who just called in had just mentioned the
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:57.360]  third part of it is taxation without representation.
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:01.360]  And then it's so big because even though our founding fathers started
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:05.360]  this country based on that concept, no taxation without representation,
[2:12:05.360 --> 2:12:07.360]  that's exactly what we have now.
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:10.360]  And you really can't do anything about it.
[2:12:10.360 --> 2:12:12.360]  Yes, go down to your local hall.
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:16.360]  I say participate in local politics as much as possible.
[2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:19.360]  But at the end of the day, you still have the IRS and the feds to deal
[2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:20.360]  with as well as your state.
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:24.360]  And the thing is, if you can't get proper representation because you're
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:28.360]  not in Congress, you're not connected family wise to the globalists,
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:32.360]  what you need is an advocate that's a legal representative who's going to
[2:12:32.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  fight for your rights and represent you upon that matter.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:37.360]  That's what we do.
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:40.360]  And Alex, it's just like you said, it doesn't matter if you have money.
[2:12:40.360 --> 2:12:43.360]  If you don't have any money, you don't, you need to make sure you're
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:46.360]  paying the government who has admitted that they don't like you.
[2:12:46.360 --> 2:12:48.360]  They want to make you broke.
[2:12:48.360 --> 2:12:53.360]  They want to take away your dream of owning property and you rent so that,
[2:12:53.360 --> 2:12:55.360]  you know, they can have their globalist agenda.
[2:12:55.360 --> 2:12:59.360]  And so what we intend to do and what we do for your listeners,
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:04.360]  for the rest of my clients is we provide the options that have typically
[2:13:04.360 --> 2:13:08.360]  only been available by the elitists, by the globalists, by those in power.
[2:13:08.360 --> 2:13:10.360]  And we make those options useful too.
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:14.360]  We've talked a lot about corporations already.
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:15.360]  We'll talk a little bit about that more today.
[2:13:15.360 --> 2:13:20.360]  What we haven't spoke about, yes, is a very simple five-letter word that,
[2:13:20.360 --> 2:13:23.360]  you know, the elitists have been using since the beginning of time to
[2:13:23.360 --> 2:13:26.360]  maintain power and it's called a trust, right?
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:30.360]  Now, when you think about a trust right after that, you might be bored.
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:32.360]  You thought, well, trust law is so boring.
[2:13:32.360 --> 2:13:33.360]  It's so complex.
[2:13:33.360 --> 2:13:36.360]  Yes, Alex, that's right because think about it.
[2:13:36.360 --> 2:13:39.360]  It's the more information, the more complex they can make something just
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:42.360]  like the tax laws, then they know you're not going to be able to study
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:47.360]  and up on it and know what happens when they're screwing you over for their benefit.
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:50.360]  So the thing is this is many people hear the word trust and like,
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:54.360]  I don't have enough assets to have a trust, not the case.
[2:13:54.360 --> 2:13:59.360]  If you have anything at all, a little amount, a large amount, guess what?
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:03.360]  If it's not protected, either the government or somebody else can take it
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:06.360]  and that's where a trust comes in to protect you and your family's future.
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:09.360]  And you guys are trust experts, have an army of folks ready to do it
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:12.360]  for whatever people's particular needs are.
[2:14:12.360 --> 2:14:15.360]  Like if somebody's got a gun collection of 10 guns or 100 guns,
[2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:17.360]  they need to have those in a trust.
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:19.360]  Absolutely, Alex, because you need it.
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:23.360]  Honestly, I've said this before is if you're right here, your money's right here.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:26.360]  We need the most amount of space between you and your assets.
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:29.360]  And the way we accomplish that is through trust instruments
[2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:31.360]  and through corporate instruments.
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:33.360]  And again, it depends on what your goal is.
[2:14:33.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  Give us a call and we will get the right bespoke option for you.
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:40.360]  I've got people standing by the phones right now.
[2:14:40.360 --> 2:14:41.360]  Give us a call.
[2:14:41.360 --> 2:14:43.360]  If you don't get through, give us a call again.
[2:14:43.360 --> 2:14:46.360]  Alex, like you said, it's a big thing.
[2:14:46.360 --> 2:14:51.360]  We've got lots of people calling us and I'm very glad that this is a 360 win for everybody.
[2:14:51.360 --> 2:14:56.360]  But keep in mind, every cent that you pay to the government
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:14:59.360]  is going to things that you don't believe in.
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.360]  Ukraine, Hunter Biden's legal defense, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:10.360]  So it's your duty as a patriotic American to pay the least amount as possible
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:12.360]  to the regime, to the globalists.
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:15.360]  And we are experts in making that happen,
[2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:20.360]  whether it's through a corporate structure or a trust structure
[2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.360]  or a myriad of the two.
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  We're also going to talk about adjustment to the gift tax to inflation.
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:28.360]  There's so many things.
[2:15:28.360 --> 2:15:32.360]  We're going to be talking about how to protect yourself in inflation, housing exemptions.
[2:15:32.360 --> 2:15:34.360]  We're looking at so many.
[2:15:34.360 --> 2:15:35.360]  There's a bunch of points.
[2:15:35.360 --> 2:15:38.360]  I'm going to shut up when we come back and have you just go through all this tower.
[2:15:38.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  You've really prepared a lot of key info for folks out there.
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:44.360]  They need to understand whether they're very wealthy, whether they're middle class,
[2:15:44.360 --> 2:15:46.360]  whether you're just a working class person.
[2:15:46.360 --> 2:15:47.360]  It doesn't matter.
[2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  There are loopholes and there are tactics and there are legal things for you to do.
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:53.360]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:57.360]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:57.360 --> 2:16:02.360]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[2:16:02.360 --> 2:16:05.360]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists
[2:16:05.360 --> 2:16:10.360]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:13.360]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:16.360]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWars.com
[2:16:16.360 --> 2:16:19.360]  like books and films and supplements and water filtration.
[2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:20.360]  Air filtration is so much more.
[2:16:20.360 --> 2:16:23.360]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:27.360]  so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time,
[2:16:27.360 --> 2:16:34.360]  go to InfoWars.com and right at the top you'll see a link to mega straight donation.

[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:41.360]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[2:16:41.360 --> 2:16:45.360]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now
[2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:50.360]  and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the great reset
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:54.360]  by going to InfoWars.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[2:16:54.360 --> 2:17:23.360]  Thank you so much for your support. Please take action.
[2:17:24.360 --> 2:17:50.360]  Thank you.
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:18:16.360]  Thank you.
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:42.360]  Thank you.
[2:18:42.360 --> 2:19:08.360]  Thank you.
[2:19:08.360 --> 2:19:34.360]  Thank you.
[2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:58.360]  Thank you.
[2:19:58.360 --> 2:20:08.360]  Thank you.
[2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:57.360]  Thank you.
[2:20:57.360 --> 2:21:12.360]  Thank you.
[2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:13.360]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:20.360]  One of the most important things to understand right now about taxation is how inflation,
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.360]  which is single biggest force in the country right now, is affecting it all.
[2:21:24.360 --> 2:21:27.360]  Because if you don't understand it, you're going to pay more in taxes.
[2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:29.360]  Let me give you a few examples.
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:35.360]  So the tax code is indexed for inflation, meaning that the inflation that the government believes
[2:21:35.360 --> 2:21:39.360]  with 3% a year or so, it goes up that much.
[2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:44.360]  For example, from $11.5 million lifetime exemption, which I'll explain what that means in a second,
[2:21:44.360 --> 2:21:46.360]  it's now $12 million.
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:52.360]  What that means is your entire life, you can give out $12 million of gifts before it hits your estate.
[2:21:52.360 --> 2:21:57.360]  That's one way knowing these rules and how it's gone up a little bit, that we can actually
[2:21:57.360 --> 2:21:59.360]  feng shui the system and get you to pay the lease amount of taxes.
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:02.360]  But let me tell you something a little bit more insidious.
[2:22:02.360 --> 2:22:10.360]  Because gift tax is actually indexed for inflation, but there's several provisions of the tax code
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:17.360]  that affect many people in the middle class, everybody, that are not in fact indexed for inflation.
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:19.360]  For example, housing exemptions.
[2:22:19.360 --> 2:22:25.360]  The housing exemption of a quarter million dollars on your single family or your house that you live in,
[2:22:25.360 --> 2:22:34.360]  when you sell it, not investment, just where you live, there is a $250,000 individual or $500,000
[2:22:34.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  if you're married exemption on the capital gains from that property.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.360]  Well, here's the thing, Alex, that law was put into place 25 years ago.
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:52.360]  And if you do the math between what $250,000 is worth today, it's a lot closer to a million dollars
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:57.360]  because we've experienced 80% inflation in the last 25 years.
[2:22:57.360 --> 2:22:59.360]  And that has not even been indexed.
[2:22:59.360 --> 2:23:04.360]  It is still the original numbers that they decided in 1997.
[2:23:04.360 --> 2:23:12.360]  Well, I don't think anything happened in 1997 is really relevant now, especially the money and what it was worth before inflation.
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:20.360]  So that's one example where if you're not set up correctly, if you don't give me a call and we can make sure we get you
[2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:26.360]  in the proper entity, in the proper setup, in the proper trust going forward, you sell that property,
[2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:29.360]  inflation is going to make sure you pay more in taxes.
[2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:31.360]  So that's one example.
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:37.360]  Here's another example that hits a lot of our older audience members here is if you're receiving social security,
[2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:41.360]  you know that if you receive more than $25,000 a year in addition to that,
[2:23:41.360 --> 2:23:48.360]  your social security, which you already paid 10 years of paying into the system to get, becomes taxable.
[2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:51.360]  And at that point it's taxed at 50%.
[2:23:51.360 --> 2:24:02.360]  That, again, is another provision in the tax code that has existed since 1997 with no changes to that provision.
[2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:10.360]  With people on social security who have paid into the system, it's kind of adding insult to injury to say they owe taxes on that on top of it.
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:17.360]  That, again, is another one of these things that many people probably just pay and don't actually know that we can help you out with
[2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:19.360]  that with the proper entity setup.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:23.360]  So here's the other thing is the states, the states are no better.
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:30.360]  41 out of 50 states do not index their tax rates for inflation at all, any of them.
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:36.360]  Now there are nine states that do, but clearly as I'm telling you, they base it on the IRS and so we're behind.
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:43.360]  So you got it, the only way out of that problem is to pay a flat tax rate because if you're paying a flat tax rate,
[2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:49.360]  doesn't matter how much, how devalued the US currency is, that means you're paying the same amount in taxes.
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:57.360]  When it's, when you're in a graduated rate system, then if the rate of inflation does not go up at the same amount,
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  you're necessarily paying more in taxes while you make the same amount of money, which is worth less, as you know,
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:08.360]  when you go into the gas station or go to buy a gallon of milk.
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:15.360]  So it's starting to hit you from two ways and it's very important that you know these things so that we can help you
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:18.360]  because awareness of the problem is the first step.
[2:25:18.360 --> 2:25:21.360]  Then you can get someone in your corner to fight.
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:27.360]  Okay, if you got Mike Tyson, the IRS and the other side of the corner, okay, you don't want to stand up to them alone.
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:32.360]  You need a boxer that's bigger, better, and you're going to take them out and that's where we step into the picture.
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:36.360]  So listen, that's what smart tax planning is all about.
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.360]  Okay, it's knowing how not just the tax code is changing every year and preparing for it,
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:50.360]  but also how other economic events such as inflation, such as the changing laws, play into that as well.
[2:25:50.360 --> 2:25:54.360]  And what we can do here is absolutely make sure you're paying less.
[2:25:54.360 --> 2:25:59.360]  If all I really need is you give me your tax return you filed out last year,
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:04.360]  I will show you all the spots where we could have taken advantage of and will do next year.
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:08.360]  And then you're going to ask why your CPA or law firm didn't do that when it's the law.
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:11.360]  Why don't they do that, Tyler?
[2:26:11.360 --> 2:26:16.360]  The reason that they don't do it is because most CPAs are risk adverse.
[2:26:16.360 --> 2:26:22.360]  That means when the IRS does their IRM, the Internal Revenue Manual Bulletin every year,
[2:26:22.360 --> 2:26:30.360]  they go off of those things that the IRS is saying, this is what our non-lawyers have interpreted the law to be,
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:33.360]  and they just go off it even though many of them have...
[2:26:33.360 --> 2:26:37.360]  That's what I've been told by top CPAs here in Austin that have given me the same advice you've given me.
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:40.360]  They said, look, the whole IRS is social engineering. It doesn't even run the country.
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  They just print the money. This is so the rich and powerful can buy everything up.
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  And so the public is basically being sapped to keep us non-competitive and consolidate control.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:52.360]  That's basically feudalism.
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:57.360]  And so the IRS puts out this report and says, well, we don't like this. We don't like that.
[2:26:57.360 --> 2:27:02.360]  Even though it's the law, and people go, oh, well, the bully says, I don't get the same law as the elite,
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:05.360]  and then they just screw you over because you don't have knowledge.
[2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  It's totally sick. It's totally evil.
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:09.360]  Exactly right, Alex.
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  So your average tax repair or CPA firm, tax prep firm, when that IRM bulletin comes out,
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:24.360]  they are going to look at it and they're not, you know, CPAs by their nature are not advocates.
[2:27:24.360 --> 2:27:30.360]  They are risk adverse. They just want to get the return done and not get in trouble themselves.
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  They don't care about making sure you have the least amount of taxes paid.
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:40.360]  That's where an advocate, a tax attorney comes into the picture because what a tax attorney does,
[2:27:40.360 --> 2:27:47.360]  what we do is we don't care what the IRS, what some clerk down there interpreted the internal revenue manual to be.
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:51.360]  We know what the actual law is and we will assert your rights because if you're right as a taxpayer,
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:53.360]  they'd not pay one penny more than you.
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  And let's explain. You guys cut to the chase.
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:00.360]  A lot of law firms, you've got CPAs, too, kind of drag you through, milk you, do all this stuff.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:05.360]  In most cases, you just look at right away where they can save money and then they legally do it,
[2:28:05.360 --> 2:28:08.360]  and then you guys just get a percentage of it, basically.
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  Right? So when you call us, basically, we're going to let you know what your situation is,
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:19.360]  how we can help, and what we, you know, our attorneys over here think the best way for it is.
[2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:22.360]  It's up to you if you want to make that move or not.
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:26.360]  But what I'm telling you is for you, me, and everyone in the audience,
[2:28:26.360 --> 2:28:33.360]  it would not make sense to pay, you know, people who admit openly that they hate you and give them your money.
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:39.360]  And let's expand on this. We're going to break this as key. You guys routinely get 90% back tax forgiveness
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:42.360]  just because your lawyers are not allowed to call up and negotiate.
[2:28:42.360 --> 2:28:46.360]  That's just one of the services, but that's one that everybody, as the penalties and interests are piling up,
[2:28:46.360 --> 2:28:48.360]  should be calling you and doing that.
[2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:52.360]  If you try to negotiate, it's going to be terrible. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:28:52.360 --> 2:29:21.360]  This is Secret Info.
[2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:27.360]  This is a symbol of defiance here in America, along with the imagery of a black star and cannon
[2:29:27.360 --> 2:29:31.360]  in the flag used by Texans during the state's Revolution Against Mexico.
[2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:35.360]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase,
[2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:40.360]  with one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of Come and Take It,
[2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:45.360]  and the reverse side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription Free Men Bear Arms.

[2:30:58.360 --> 2:31:03.360]  Infowars has made history. You have made history in your support of Infowars.
[2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:08.360]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the censors has been
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:12.360]  Patriot Apparel so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word,
[2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:17.360]  and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com so they can understand the globalist plan
[2:31:17.360 --> 2:31:19.360]  and how to stop it. Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:31:19.360 --> 2:31:22.360]  two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts,
[2:31:22.360 --> 2:31:26.360]  some of which go back more than 25 years. All these shirts are limited edition.
[2:31:26.360 --> 2:31:31.360]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:35.360]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left.
[2:31:35.360 --> 2:31:37.360]  In a couple weeks they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[2:31:37.360 --> 2:31:42.360]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:47.360]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic
[2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:51.360]  shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:53.360]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[2:31:53.360 --> 2:32:18.360]  Infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:31.360]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[2:32:31.360 --> 2:32:35.360]  Because they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left,
[2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:39.360]  which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[2:32:39.360 --> 2:32:42.360]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:46.360]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:50.360]  It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[2:32:50.360 --> 2:32:54.360]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[2:32:54.360 --> 2:33:23.360]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:26.360]  Alex Jones.
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:00.360]  They literally stand behind what they tell you and cut right to the chase and save you so much money.
[2:34:00.360 --> 2:34:03.360]  Hundreds of different options they can do for anybody.
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:07.360]  Go to jonestaxrelief.com. That takes you right to American tax relief.
[2:34:07.360 --> 2:34:10.360]  And that way we get credit and it keeps us on the air at 361.
[2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:13.360]  You're crazy if you don't make the call and get a consultation, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:20.360]  American tax relief for 833-900-4285-833-900-4285.
[2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:24.360]  Tyler Bennett, all ears taken away.
[2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:28.360]  Alright Alex, so there's two asset classes that people need to be aware of
[2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:34.360]  and how these asset classes have been used traditionally by the globalists to avoid paying taxes
[2:34:34.360 --> 2:34:40.360]  and how you need to pay attention to this and if we want to do it the correct way,
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:42.360]  I'm going to be all over it.
[2:34:42.360 --> 2:34:45.360]  But if you do it the wrong way, especially with crypto,
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:52.360]  we know they've hired 60,000 additional IRS agents just to audit and make your life miserable.
[2:34:52.360 --> 2:34:54.360]  So these two classes are crypto as I just mentioned.
[2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:56.360]  We'll talk about that in a second and art.
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:35:01.360]  Art, especially original arts, Van Gogh's, Picasso's, this kind of thing
[2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:06.360]  has traditionally been used by the globalists to move around large sums of money
[2:35:06.360 --> 2:35:09.360]  to each other within private art sales.
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:12.360]  And these kinds of things are not reported because they're private
[2:35:12.360 --> 2:35:16.360]  and that's how they're able to, you know, illegally but still get away with it,
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:18.360]  move around a lot amount of money.
[2:35:18.360 --> 2:35:22.360]  Now there is a legal way to do this with trust as I was explaining about before.
[2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:24.360]  We are the McDonald's of trust.
[2:35:24.360 --> 2:35:26.360]  We do them all and we can help you out with there.
[2:35:26.360 --> 2:35:30.360]  But just a little bit of current events is you got Hunter Biden,
[2:35:30.360 --> 2:35:35.360]  apparently is this major novice artist now trying to sell his work
[2:35:35.360 --> 2:35:41.360]  and it is gathering some serious potential prices from the buyers, right?
[2:35:41.360 --> 2:35:46.360]  And so why this is obviously an issue is his connection with the government
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:48.360]  and he can buy the government in this country.
[2:35:48.360 --> 2:35:53.360]  Well, it seems like it's becoming cheaper and cheaper for the right people every day.
[2:35:53.360 --> 2:35:59.360]  So what they said is their solution is, well, we just won't disclose to the president's son
[2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:04.360]  or to anybody else how much this art sold for and what it actually sold for.
[2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:07.360]  So they're basically admitting that they're going to do a private sale
[2:36:07.360 --> 2:36:10.360]  and because he's part of the right group, they're not going to pay taxes on it
[2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:14.360]  because how can you pay taxes on an amount of money that you don't know that you made?
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:15.360]  So it's ridiculous.
[2:36:15.360 --> 2:36:18.360]  The private people, the citizens, the middle class seem to be aware
[2:36:18.360 --> 2:36:21.360]  that this kind of thing is going on because yes, of course,
[2:36:21.360 --> 2:36:26.360]  there is always true that the globalists have access to things that we don't.
[2:36:26.360 --> 2:36:29.360]  But that doesn't mean that we can't use these same loopholes
[2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:35.360]  and trust instruments to have the same outcome for the art that you might have,
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:38.360]  the art that your grandma might have up on her wall that's worth a lot of money, right?
[2:36:38.360 --> 2:36:41.360]  So give us a call for that kind of thing.
[2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:44.360]  Here's the other thing that we got to talk about is crypto, okay?
[2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:47.360]  The government is going hard against crypto.
[2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:53.360]  Biden is trying hard to regulate at every step of the chance he gets, fortunately.
[2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:58.360]  He wants to stuff so much stuff into that Build Better Back Act.
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:01.360]  It's never going to pass in its current iteration.
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:05.360]  So we have to the end of the year at least, I would guess probably until next year too,
[2:37:05.360 --> 2:37:07.360]  but I wouldn't take my chances on that.
[2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:10.360]  Use it now is the crypto loopholes.
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:16.360]  We're talking about such things as, you know, you can make crypto from buying and selling the same token,
[2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:21.360]  you can be farming, yield farming, you can be mining or staking income.
[2:37:21.360 --> 2:37:28.360]  And each of these things is taxed in a slightly different way and you have a basis just like stocks and this and that.
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.360]  Here's the beautiful thing with crypto right now is especially if you've been in the game,
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:37.360]  if you've held crypto for a couple of years or you've been playing with it for a while,
[2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:43.360]  even Coinbase, even the institutions that are going to report, they do not know what your basis is.
[2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:49.360]  And so instead of sending out 1099Bs like a brokerage firm, they're sending out 1099MISCs,
[2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:56.360]  which means every dollar that goes through your wallet that gets reported is reported as income to you.
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:00.360]  Even if you're just moving around money from one of your accounts to another, right?
[2:38:00.360 --> 2:38:02.360]  It's going to get reported as income.
[2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:08.360]  You need somebody who knows that that's the case to report the right basis number for you so you don't get hit up
[2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:14.360]  with additional taxes for money you didn't even make or positions you haven't sold yet so you don't owe.
[2:38:14.360 --> 2:38:19.360]  And right now you're consulting with us on the big Bitcoin donations we got.
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:25.360]  I told you I want 100% of it to go into funding this operation so we're making sure that it goes through that
[2:38:25.360 --> 2:38:32.360]  and then any taxes are paid through running the operation, not paid as if I actually got that money.
[2:38:32.360 --> 2:38:37.360]  Exactly. And that's one example of what we can do in the crypto field.
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:40.360]  And this is the kind of thing that we got to take care of now.
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:47.360]  So if you've made a decent chunk of money in crypto in the last year or you have a decent chunk of crypto
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:54.360]  you've just been holding on to, give me a call because the wrong thing to do is to check that box
[2:38:54.360 --> 2:38:57.360]  on your 1040 that says I don't have any crypto assets.
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:00.360]  Those are the people they're going to go after because they know you're lying.
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:02.360]  So don't lie to the government.
[2:39:02.360 --> 2:39:08.360]  We will just tell them exactly what happened but we're going to paint the lights in your favor.
[2:39:08.360 --> 2:39:13.360]  The government doesn't know what your basis in Ethereum is so we're going to make one that's a little bit better
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:15.360]  probably than what they would want it to be.
[2:39:15.360 --> 2:39:20.360]  And guess what? They're going to accept it because you're reporting the crypto.
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:25.360]  That means you're out of the people who they want to audit already because they're going after everybody
[2:39:25.360 --> 2:39:27.360]  who thinks they can stay under the radar.
[2:39:27.360 --> 2:39:31.360]  You know, the meme of, oh, I lost all my crypto in a shipwreck.
[2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:33.360]  Okay, yeah, here's the problem.
[2:39:33.360 --> 2:39:37.360]  They can look into your public address too just like anybody else can and they can see those funds are still there.
[2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:40.360]  And they don't necessarily need to go after that to attack you.
[2:39:40.360 --> 2:39:45.360]  If you own a house, if you have money in a bank account, they love attacking that because that's a lot.
[2:39:45.360 --> 2:39:47.360]  It's very easy for them to grab money out of a bank account.
[2:39:47.360 --> 2:39:53.360]  So make sure you're protected. Make sure you're in the right entity structure going forward.
[2:39:53.360 --> 2:39:58.360]  Give me a call. We can do that if you have crypto assets because it's just huge right now.
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:06.360]  What Biden is trying to levy on the American people because they believe, and this is reported on not an American news,
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:14.360]  only in BBC Al Jazeera, not American news, is the IRS has said that they pretty much believe if you have a sizable amount of cryptocurrency,
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:18.360]  more chance than not that you're a criminal. Now, that's absurd, right?
[2:40:18.360 --> 2:40:23.360]  But that's the way the government is because they don't care if they violate your rights like I was telling you.
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:33.360]  They will do it and you won't be any wiser because there is no taxation without representation if you don't have an advocate to represent you.
[2:40:33.360 --> 2:40:40.360]  And that's what I'm here to do because it just drives me crazy when I see the IRS and I've seen revenue officers come out now
[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:46.360]  in people's houses and assessments at this point and claiming they owe millions of dollars in crypto
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:53.360]  and they may not even have that total number of assets because the amount of, like I said, that was 1099 to them,
[2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:59.360]  was 1099 the wrong way and your average person isn't going to be able to figure that out.
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:05.360]  And the average CPA and even the average lawyer has no idea about crypto.
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:13.360]  Because I know you're really good, but I called three different law firms and they couldn't even give me answers on the big crypto donations.
[2:41:13.360 --> 2:41:19.360]  But then what you told me, I went and checked and even saw main finance reports, again,
[2:41:19.360 --> 2:41:24.360]  that the average person isn't reading but are in finance journals saying exactly the advice you gave us.
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:30.360]  Absolutely. And here's the thing is we're in the financial district of downtown LA.
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:35.360]  We're right here with Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, all the big accounting firms,
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:42.360]  and they will send their potential crypto clients away because they don't want to deal with the potential liability.
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:45.360]  They're scared. They don't want to actually have to act as an advocate for their clients.
[2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:50.360]  Well, that's the same reason I didn't get involved in it 12 years ago when it was all launching and people tried to give me Max Kaiser,
[2:41:50.360 --> 2:41:53.360]  10,000 bitcoins. I didn't understand it, so I didn't want to get involved.
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:57.360]  Now it's here to stay in one way or another. I need to learn about it. I need to get engaged in it.
[2:41:57.360 --> 2:42:02.360]  I'm involved in it. And so that's what I'm doing in a process. So I'm learning more and more. It's very interesting.
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:08.360]  Absolutely. And I'd recommend the rest of your audience to do the same because, listen, as we know,
[2:42:08.360 --> 2:42:12.360]  if there is an asset class out there, and that's why I brought up art, if there is an asset class...
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:17.360]  And we know the elites are heavily in crypto, heavily in Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[2:42:17.360 --> 2:42:18.360]  That's why...
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:21.360]  That means it's not going anywhere, folks.
[2:42:21.360 --> 2:42:27.360]  They want Bitcoin, they want Ethereum, they want stuff they know that they can get because they know how to make it disappear.
[2:42:27.360 --> 2:42:31.360]  And is what they're doing illegal? Yes, but here's the thing.
[2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:35.360]  They operate on a different scale. So what we're going to do is the exact same thing as them,
[2:42:35.360 --> 2:42:41.360]  but we're going to make it legal because we know that right entities and trust setups to get you in.
[2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:46.360]  Absolutely. Absolutely. All right, Tyler Bennett, I want to come back at a few other key points with you.

[2:43:21.360 --> 2:43:27.360]  It has since become a symbol of defiance here in America, along with the imagery of a black star and cannon,
[2:43:27.360 --> 2:43:31.360]  in the flag used by Texans during the state's revolution against Mexico.
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:35.360]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase,
[2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:40.360]  with one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of come and take it,
[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:46.360]  and the reverse side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription free men bear arms.

[2:44:29.360 --> 2:44:35.360]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:44:35.360 --> 2:44:41.360]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition,
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:44.360]  immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:44:44.360 --> 2:44:51.360]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.

[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:39.360]  My friend, I'll say it clear. I'll state my case of which I'm certain.
[2:47:39.360 --> 2:48:04.360]  I've lived a life that's full. I traveled each and every highway and more. Much more than this. I did it my way.
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:09.360]  Regrets. I've had a few.
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:16.360]  All right. One kill, two wounded in shooting at Morris Jeff High graduation ceremony.
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:24.360]  It's every university and it's black on black. Still terrible but the media always covers those up when those happen because that's such an epidemic.
[2:48:24.360 --> 2:48:29.360]  Very, very sad. We got some other big breaking news here as well.
[2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:37.360]  70 missing children recovered in West Texas authority say I'll cover that a little bit in the next hour introducing our special guest host.
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:45.360]  We went back to Tyler Bennett. You know, Tyler, it's so frustrating to me to study the new world order, to study how they exempt themselves from everything.
[2:48:45.360 --> 2:48:55.360]  100%. But even for the new voriche in the establishment that next year they have it where they pay 10% of the taxes the general public does on average.
[2:48:55.360 --> 2:49:00.360]  And it's just incredible and people need to just do these tactics out of hand. It's the law.
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:07.360]  They want the general public not to know it because they want to not have competition. They want people to be poor and that makes me angry.
[2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:20.360]  I don't want people to be poor. And so it's just such a no brainer that everybody needs to call you guys at 833-945-833-945-JonesTaxRelief.com.

[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:07.360]  So good to have Tyler Bennett here with us. Continue, sir.
[2:50:07.360 --> 2:50:17.360]  So Alex, it's just like you said, the globalists, the elitists, they have their club, their cabal and even the nouveau rich, even people who have money.
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:23.360]  They're not necessarily part of the globalist club and they don't want you to be part of that club and you can't be.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:29.360]  So but here's the thing is if you do have any assets at all, this is where I want to talk about trust again.
[2:50:29.360 --> 2:50:43.360]  Trusts were the first thing that existed in this country before corporate law existed, trust law existed, existed that allowed for the Uber wealthy and even people with any money at all to protect that from their creditors,
[2:50:43.360 --> 2:50:47.360]  to protect it from other people and to maintain it for their family.
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:59.360]  Right. And so here's the thing is it doesn't matter if you are nouveau rich, if you are, you know, just have a little old properties in the middle of Virginia, whatever you got.
[2:50:59.360 --> 2:51:04.360]  If you have any property at all, you need to have that protected because here's the thing.
[2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:16.360]  During your lifetime, there will be times when the state and the government and possibly other people are going to come after your assets and try to take what you have hard earned.
[2:51:16.360 --> 2:51:19.360]  But by this, you know, the sweat of your brow.
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:32.360]  And so here's the thing is if we can separate you from your assets, like I said before, a trust instrument, which there is, you know, hundreds of years of trust law in this country that we can go back on and use.
[2:51:32.360 --> 2:51:38.360]  That's one way to protect anybody out there who is little big.
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:44.360]  It doesn't matter if you're if you're a little guy out there saying, well, hey, this sounds great, but I don't think I can afford to trust.
[2:51:44.360 --> 2:51:47.360]  We are the McDonald's of trust. We pump these things out.
[2:51:47.360 --> 2:51:48.360]  You absolutely can afford one.
[2:51:48.360 --> 2:51:57.360]  And it would be who of you to do it because let me tell you what you can afford is having your hard earned money taken from you when you don't have it properly protected.
[2:51:57.360 --> 2:52:01.360]  So a trust allows for there's several different types of trust instruments out there.
[2:52:01.360 --> 2:52:05.360]  And it's bespoke to what each client needs.
[2:52:05.360 --> 2:52:12.360]  But what in general, the two big goals would be to pay the least amount of taxes.
[2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:24.360]  Yes, but also when we're paying the least amount of taxes, that's we also want to keep our assets protected, keep those assets protected from the government, protected from any creditors, protected from anyone who may be after your money.
[2:52:24.360 --> 2:52:26.360]  And that way you can decide what happens to it.
[2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:27.360]  You can spend it.
[2:52:27.360 --> 2:52:29.360]  You can give it all to your family.
[2:52:29.360 --> 2:52:30.360]  It's your money.
[2:52:30.360 --> 2:52:33.360]  Don't let the government or anyone else have a claim to it.
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:35.360]  So let me explain this a little bit.
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:51.360]  A trust and the reason trust have existed for, you know, even British common law before this country was created is because a trust is a very informalized entity as opposed to a corporation and LLC, a partnership even.
[2:52:51.360 --> 2:52:59.360]  So what a trust is is simply and its most basic form is an agreement between three people.
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:09.360]  A settler, that means the person who's providing the money into the trust, a beneficiary, the person who receives it, and the trustee who has control over those funds.
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:21.360]  And that is the most important part because according to the tax code, even if you receive income, it is not considered taxable income to you until you have dominion over it, until you have that control.
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:34.360]  And so if we can separate that out by you still have access to the money, but technically there's a trustee that is in control of it. That is how all these elitists, all the people that you can, I mean, Zuckerberg, all the people that you can think of.
[2:53:34.360 --> 2:53:42.360]  And Tyler, spend a few minutes on the history of trust. I know some of it. I know you know more. It's totally legal. They just don't want you to know about it.
[2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:43.360]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:53:43.360 --> 2:53:58.360]  So before corporate law was developed, the idea that people were having massive amounts of gains in the early 18th, 19th century in this country, the railroads, for example.
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:22.360]  The way that people were able to maintain this wealth and pass it down generationally and create ruling class families in this country is by creating trust instruments that provided that their money would skip a generation to evade the inheritance tax and stuff like that.
[2:54:22.360 --> 2:54:33.360]  And so basically in this country before corporate law was developed around the time the IRS was developed, it was if you had a successful business, you had a trust that it existed in.
[2:54:33.360 --> 2:54:38.360]  And I'll tell you a little secret is that is absolutely true today still.
[2:54:38.360 --> 2:54:54.360]  Well, exactly with the Standard Oil Trust, the Rockefellers, the Carnegie's, all of them, it's those trust attacking us today that have trillions of dollars on a black rock. All those are really just the elite's trust. And then they just think somebody dies and grandpa had a half million dollars.
[2:54:54.360 --> 2:54:58.360]  Most of it goes to the government because grandpa didn't set a trust up. It's just ridiculous.
[2:54:58.360 --> 2:55:07.360]  That's exactly right. And so simply by family, maybe the family, maybe grandma's got 100 acres. She doesn't know she dies. The government gets it.
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:11.360]  She could have just done a trust for $1,000 and the family would have got it.
[2:55:11.360 --> 2:55:19.360]  Absolutely. It really is, you know, that simple and we could have a trust set up for you in one phone call.
[2:55:19.360 --> 2:55:23.360]  We have you sent out the documents, notarized. It can happen very quickly.
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:31.360]  And the trust is the type of thing that it's like you're never going to, after the fact, be able to put your money into a trust, right?
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:38.360]  It's like playing in the NFL without pads and a helmet. I mean, the public is not told any of this.
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:47.360]  They are not. That is correct. And that is how those same families, the elitists, the globalists, stay up because it's the control of information.
[2:55:47.360 --> 2:55:52.360]  And so the more you know, even if you just listen to me right now, now you at least know what's happening.
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:57.360]  And so you're better educated. And so when the next time they try to make a move against you, you can be prepared.
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:05.360]  Because, I mean, the thing is, is you got to apply the elitist ideas, even though we're both, everyone here is an everyday person.
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:21.360]  Okay. We're not the elitists. That does not mean we can't use the same laws that they created 100 years ago and try to hide in the back of the IRC with tons of IRM to fluff up and confuse whoever cares to actually take a look at it.
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:28.360]  So Tyler Bennett, you've got so much more for anybody. They should call, do a free consultation, talk to you guys.
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:34.360]  They need to call now 833-900-4285-833-900-4285.
[2:56:34.360 --> 2:56:41.360]  JonesTaxRelief.com just takes you right to the site where they can track how people come there so they can expand their sponsorship.
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:45.360]  They have gone from being a small sponsor to a giant sponsor. They're critical to what we do.
[2:56:45.360 --> 2:56:50.360]  They have an amazing group of products. I love Tyler Bennett. He's such a patriot. He's so smart.
[2:56:50.360 --> 2:56:56.360]  These are the folks you need to call, but whatever you do, educate yourself on this and start protecting yourself, whatever you do.
[2:56:56.360 --> 2:57:03.360]  But this is the sure thing because this is what the establishment has set up for itself. They think you're too stupid to take action.
[2:57:03.360 --> 2:57:12.360]  I know you're too smart to let these globalists keep screwing you over, so go to JonesTaxRelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[2:57:12.360 --> 2:57:19.360]  Tyler Bennett, we'll talk to you soon. I'm trying to get you to town. Plus, I want you to, you've already done some great consulting, but I want you to get over here and help me even more.
[2:57:19.360 --> 2:57:21.360]  Thank you so much and have a great week, my friend.
[2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:24.360]  You have a great week, too. Thanks for having me on.
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:29.360]  Powerful. I've done four or five interviews with him, but that one was out of the park. That's the best interview we had.
[2:57:29.360 --> 2:57:35.360]  We're going to archive this demand.video. Learn how to protect yourself the way the globalists do. Learn the tricks of the globalists.
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:50.360]  I mean, it's just absolutely essential. We'll be right back. I'm going to introduce Wayne Allen Root coming up and we'll talk about this giant 70 children saved out of sex slavery.

[3:00:08.360 --> 3:00:20.360]  Globalist, corporate, fascist government. And they brag at the Davos Group that their policies through governments they control are discrediting our governments so that the governments collapse and then we're third world countries.
[3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:30.360]  The multinationals can come in and buy up openings in the dollar. So when I see headlines out there that get almost no attention, there should be national news.
[3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:48.360]  It's being reported to EBS and ABC out of Houston that good federal agents, mainly from the Border Patrol and local police, save in just the last month 70 children being trafficked by sex traffickers.
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:57.360]  And that's buried. There's Fox 10 out of Phoenix. That's in a Texas operation.
[3:00:57.360 --> 3:01:05.360]  Where is it in the national news? Well, let's go back to why that's happening. Here's a report from six years ago or the Washington Post.
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:13.360]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers Senate report confirms knowingly.
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:16.360]  And that's what it breaks down.
[3:01:16.360 --> 3:01:22.360]  And it's only expanded probably five times bigger under Biden. It stopped under Trump.
[3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:33.360]  Here's channel two out of Houston. 70 missing children recovered in West Texas. Authorities say 70 missing children were recovered during a law enforcement operation in West Texas.
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:36.360]  Authorities announced this week.
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:47.360]  Homeland Security investigators in El Paso, the Texas Department of Public Safety and numerous other federal, state and local agencies located and recover the children as part of a three week operation.
[3:01:47.360 --> 3:01:54.360]  The operation lost souls, which ran from the end April through May. We're only learning now in El Paso Midland.
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:02:05.360]  An actor said Tom Green counties recovered the missing youth. Many of them runaways range from age 10 to 17. Some small in the U.S.
[3:02:05.360 --> 3:02:12.360]  It goes on. The children recovered included victims of sex trafficking and physical and sexual abuse.
[3:02:12.360 --> 3:02:25.360]  U.S. Customs Integration Enforcement said in the news release, the majority of the children were located in West Texas, but some are located in the Dallas, Fort Worth Metroplex as well as state of Colorado and in Mexico.
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:27.360]  And it goes on from there.
[3:02:27.360 --> 3:02:32.360]  And why is that so important? This stuff comes out almost every day.
[3:02:32.360 --> 3:02:43.360]  And it's back of the newspaper because the Democrats like Pelosi say that MS-13 are God's children.
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:54.360]  And they are involved in the biggest human smuggling operation in history in Europe and the U.S., collapsing the third world of lockdown policies.
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:03:03.360]  And then flooding us with these people that use children across the border because they're let go. They have children. And then they send the children back over and do it over and over again.
[3:03:03.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  Some children as young as one year old throwing babies over the fences, over the walls.
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.360]  Where is the humanization of this? Where is AOC? Where are these people? And the answer is nowhere.
[3:03:16.360 --> 3:03:30.360]  One of the biggest things Trump did was almost stop this, take it from massive under Obama to a trickle. And now under Biden, it's boom, massively bigger than anything Obama did.
[3:03:30.360 --> 3:03:38.360]  This is pure, absolute, complete, and total satanic evil.
[3:03:38.360 --> 3:03:46.360]  But that's why independent media exists. That's why you support Info Wars. That's why you spread the word. That's why you pray for the broadcast.
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:54.360]  Is because we're reaching millions of people right now and the system is as mad as a beehive that got kicked.
[3:03:54.360 --> 3:04:18.360]  It's as mad as a hornet's nest that we're still on air in defiance of everything they're doing and we're going to be here as long as we can with our own infrastructure, our own systems, and huge investments of things you don't even know about to make sure the transmission gets out no matter what if we got to do whatever it takes.
[3:04:18.360 --> 3:04:30.360]  So, great job to the crew. Amazing job to everybody. And I'm just very blessed and humbled to be here and to be part of what's happening because we're winning spiritually. We're winning culturally.
[3:04:30.360 --> 3:04:40.360]  We're winning the hearts and minds. But the globalists know that and they are pulling the rug out from everybody. They are turning over the chessboard and they are going for broke right now.
[3:04:40.360 --> 3:04:56.360]  Alright, best selling author, talk show host Wayne Allen Root is coming up. I've got a little bit more to say. I'll hand the baton to him. We come back in T-minus 60 seconds. Wayne Allen Root is set to take over Root4America.com.

[3:08:15.360 --> 3:08:27.360]  Now, Wayne Allen Root of RootForAmerica.com, best selling author, syndicated columnist, talk show host, you name it, take it over right now.
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:48.360]  All right, thank you, Alex, Wayne Allen Root, RootForAmerica.com. And you can always email me, WayneRoot, at gmail.com. Love to hear from you. I get all my best information from my fans. I get so many great ideas for what I'm going to talk about on my national radio show, on TV shows like this one with Alex Jones, on my social media, on my nationally syndicated newspaper columns.
[3:08:48.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  Moments ago, literally in the last 30 minutes or so, we found out that Hillary Clinton lawyer, Michael Sussman, the first person brought to trial by Durham, the prosecutor, John Durham, is acquitted of lying to the FBI.
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:21.360]  And you know, I get asked this every day, Wayne, is Durham our savior? Is Durham the answer? And I didn't know this was going to happen. It was pretty clear this guy was guilty. Pretty clear. Anyone could see, if you weren't blind, that Michael Sussman was guilty of a massive crime here, fraud and cover-up.
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:35.360]  But he got found innocent. And I didn't know that at the time, when I'm asked this question over the last two weeks, and I keep saying, no, Durham is not our savior. No, this is not the answer, because the system is corrupt.
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:53.360]  The judges are corrupt. The prosecutors are corrupt. And the juries are corrupt. These trials go on in Washington, D.C., where 90, some like 97% of voters are registered Democrat. You can't get a fair jury in Washington, D.C.
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:10:08.360]  You can't ever prosecute Hillary, Obama, Biden, Kamala, John Kerry, all the criminals out there, or any of their people. You can't get a fair trial, a fair hearing. So proof is in now. You can't.
[3:10:08.360 --> 3:10:23.360]  And then I wanted to read you something very funny here. FDA official in charge of evaluating new drugs for the FDA Food and Drug Administration is hospitalized for a mental disorder.
[3:10:23.360 --> 3:10:40.360]  I would tell you they're all insane. Basically, the entire Democrat Party is a mixture of radical communist nut job, mentally ill nut job, and people who hate America, and people who are just bizarre with bizarre lifestyles.
[3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:53.360]  You know, like Rachel Levine, one of the most important people in healthcare in the United States, is not quite sure. And I'm certainly not sure. Is it a man? Is it a woman? Did they keep their penis on their vagina? I don't really know.
[3:10:53.360 --> 3:11:03.360]  It's so confusing what Rachel Levine is. And she's the number two person at Health and Human Services. That's the left. They're all crazy. They're nut jobs.
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:15.360]  And mix all that in with their literally, like, mesmerized, hypnotized by the devil. There's Rachel Levine. Is that a man or is that a woman? To me, that's a man with a wig.
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:27.360]  That is an incredibly unattractive man with a wig. That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life. That's the number two person in healthcare in the United States who isn't quite sure what's going on down there.
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:37.360]  It's so bizarre. I don't know what to say. It's bizarre. I've never been in my life anti-gay. You want to be gay? I love you. Go be gay in the privacy of your own home.
[3:11:37.360 --> 3:11:49.360]  Be as gay as you want. Be as lesbian as you want. Be as transsexual as you want. I don't care. But stop shoving in our faces. Stop trying to teach kindergartners that it's okay. It's all weird.
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:59.360]  This whole new obsession with transgenderism is weird. But there's so many mentally ill people and so many people owned by the devil in the Democrat Party now.
[3:11:59.360 --> 3:12:08.360]  And the top official at the FDA in charge of evaluating new drugs is hospitalized for a mental disorder. Isn't that perfect?
[3:12:08.360 --> 3:12:20.360]  Par for the course. It backs up everything I've said about the people who have been saying the vaccine is great. The vaccine is fine for pregnant women. Well, all the pregnant women have miscarriages.
[3:12:20.360 --> 3:12:31.360]  The vaccines fine for children. Well, children that are breastfed are dying and are getting diseases we never imagined possible because their mom that they're breastfeeding from is vaccinated.
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:47.360]  It's all lies, corruption, mental illness, and an evil, obviously an evil mass murder plot that's put together by the devil or people who worship the devil because I've never seen normal humans who'd be willing to kill little babies like this.
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:13:01.360]  They've gone from abortion murder, you know, during the pregnancy in the womb to abortion murder after a baby's born at the moment of birth to abortion murder a week after birth. I'm sure it'll be a month after birth.
[3:13:01.360 --> 3:13:17.360]  But they're also using the vaccines to kill babies in breastfeeding mothers and to give the vaccine to babies that will kill them or main them for life. Then there's the baby formula shortage that was purposely concocted by the government.
[3:13:17.360 --> 3:13:25.360]  Biden knew about it and did nothing and announced nothing. Now there's mile long lines over the weekend in Michigan and I'm sure all over the United States.
[3:13:25.360 --> 3:13:31.360]  But I saw the mile long line in Michigan of parents waiting in line to get baby formula. So their kids don't die.
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:44.360]  The Democrat Party must stay up at night late thinking of new ways to murder babies and to kill off the population and to make all of us sick, ill, crippled, disabled.
[3:13:44.360 --> 3:13:57.360]  It's just sick and the numbers are coming out. This vaccine is not just death for the average person, death for the working age person who was mandated to take it. It's death for babies.
[3:13:57.360 --> 3:14:06.360]  The amount of miscarriages, my gosh, and the amount of children are getting sick. The new hepatitis outbreak, I'd be willing to bet you any amount of money.
[3:14:06.360 --> 3:14:13.360]  The new hepatitis outbreak is tied to all women who are breastfeeding and they've been vaccinated and the vaccine is coming through the babies.
[3:14:13.360 --> 3:14:23.360]  I just saw proof over the weekend in the Pfizer pre-trials which were filled with fraud, by the way, and they covered up all the deaths and all the injuries.
[3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:32.360]  But they tried to say that pregnant women, it's okay and breastfeeding moms, it's okay. Well, they showed in the pre-trials that the babies all died.
[3:14:32.360 --> 3:14:40.360]  Miscarriage is left and right. I think it was 82% miscarry. And then they showed one woman, one, I'm sure they'll say that's a freak stat,
[3:14:40.360 --> 3:14:48.360]  one woman who was vaccinated in the trial who was breastfeeding, her breast milk came out blue and the baby died.
[3:14:48.360 --> 3:14:58.360]  I wonder if there's a tie between those two things. You think maybe? You think maybe we're in a period of mass murder by the medical establishment?
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:11.360]  This is crazy. I'm the guy who wrote the column that's been out there and has gone viral all over the country about, I finally figured out COVID and it's all about creed and they've convinced all the doctors and they've convinced all the medical professionals
[3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:21.360]  and all the scientists, they convinced them all the vaccine was fine based on the trials. The trials were all fraud. The trials were all covered up and the doctors didn't know it.
[3:15:21.360 --> 3:15:27.360]  Now they found out the doctors don't want to say anything because they're afraid they'll get sued. So everybody's covering it up.
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:36.360]  Wayne Allyn Root, we'll be right back more with the war on the Alex Jones show. It was an honor to be with you. Root4America.com, Wayne Root at gmail.com.

[3:20:25.360 --> 3:20:35.360]  I did not let anyone know on my two Facebook pages, my personal and my fan page because they'll probably ban me the minute they hear the word InfoWars or Alex Jones.
[3:20:35.360 --> 3:20:42.360]  I mean, Twitter has banned me for life. Facebook has shadowed banning the F out of me so that almost no one could see me on Facebook.
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:52.360]  But any time I mention anything about Alex Jones, that's it. Boom. Suspend it for a week. I mean, it's a joke. The amount of censorship out there, it's a joke.
[3:20:52.360 --> 3:21:00.360]  And it's sad and it's depressing and it's a reality. As a matter of fact, I'm sure I've mentioned this on the Alex Jones show, but I want to mention it again.
[3:21:00.360 --> 3:21:12.360]  How many of you remember that a few months back it became a fact that Newsmax TV and Fox News took millions of dollars from the federal government as bribes?
[3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:23.360]  Literally, I'm sure they couch them as advertising deals. But the government said, if we give you five million to advertise the vaccine, will you get rid of all anti-vaccine hosts and all anti-vaccine?
[3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:26.360]  Yes. And make sure you vaccinate the whole staff.
[3:21:26.360 --> 3:21:39.360]  This has really gone on in America at Fox News and at Newsmax TV. So there's nobody left but people like Wayne Root and Alex Jones and a rare few others to tell you the truth.
[3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:54.360]  It's incredible. And by the way, soon there literally will be no one left because you can guess that most of the hosts at Fox News and Newsmax will be dead or maimed for the rest of their lives very soon.
[3:21:54.360 --> 3:22:02.360]  And very soon it could mean tomorrow. It could mean a month for now. It could mean a year for now. We don't know and I don't know because there were no vaccine trials.
[3:22:02.360 --> 3:22:13.360]  They ended all semblance of a real trial. There was no control group. We have no idea whether everybody dies. Some people die. Some people never die.
[3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:23.360]  Or eventually everybody's crippled, maimed, disabled or died from these vaccines. But we know there's a mass die-off very quickly after you get vaccinated.
[3:22:23.360 --> 3:22:31.360]  We know there's a mass die-off a day later, two days later, a week later, two weeks later. And then some people die slowly but surely over time.
[3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:41.360]  But it's only been a year now. And so we don't even know when the mass die-off, the mass mass die-offs, could happen. But the numbers are staggering.
[3:22:41.360 --> 3:22:55.360]  Today we found out numbers released by Alabama, the state of Alabama, show that people under the age of 65 are dying right now much faster at a higher rate than people over the age of 65.
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:08.360]  When has this ever happened in the history of America? And wait a minute. Hold on. I got to show you the seventh card. And it's only happened since 2021 when the COVID vaccine came into effect.
[3:23:08.360 --> 3:23:17.360]  It was mandated. The year 2021 on, people under the age of 65 have died in higher numbers than people over the age of 65.
[3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:27.360]  When in history of young people died in higher numbers faster than old people? When? Never. Except with this vaccine. Incredible.
[3:23:27.360 --> 3:23:34.360]  So I want to finish up FDA official in charge of evaluating new drugs hospitalized for mental disorder. I started this in the last segment.
[3:23:34.360 --> 3:23:55.360]  Dr. Jeffrey Siegel, I had to give you his name. Director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation Sciences was transported from his home to a hospital for mental disorder at 3 a.m. on May 9th, according to Montgomery County, Maryland police dispatch logs reviewed by the Daily Wire.
[3:23:55.360 --> 3:24:06.360]  So this is not me making up. This is not hearsay. This is not rumor. This is from police logs from Montgomery County, Maryland. The guy is nuts.
[3:24:06.360 --> 3:24:14.360]  But let's say I'm an opinion host. This is an opinion show. And it's my opinion. The guy is freaking loony nuts.
[3:24:14.360 --> 3:24:25.360]  And he's in charge of evaluating new drugs for the FDA. I'm sure he was the head guy to evaluate vaccines for the FDA. Oh, this vaccine is perfect. Excuse me when I go back to my medical institution.
[3:24:25.360 --> 3:24:34.360]  This is what you're dealing with. I know this is all funny. It's like a saturday night routine. But it's the truth. They're nuts.
[3:24:34.360 --> 3:24:44.360]  And they're obviously suicidal or maybe they're not so nuts. And they're not so suicidal. I mean, this guy is Dr. Jeffrey Siegel. Maybe not since suicidal.
[3:24:44.360 --> 3:24:56.360]  But obviously the ones who run the COVID vaccine manufacturing companies at Big Pharma may not be that nuts because this was the big story this weekend that had to bring up right now.
[3:24:56.360 --> 3:25:06.360]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccine, injected himself with salt water, now facing criminal charges.
[3:25:06.360 --> 3:25:23.360]  So according to police, they've charged Jose Maria Fernandez, Suso Farah, the president of European pharmaceutical giant Pharma Mar with being falsely vaccinated against COVID-19.
[3:25:23.360 --> 3:25:32.360]  He paid somebody in a position to give him a fake vaccine so we have a vaccine card so you can tell everyone he's vaccinated.
[3:25:32.360 --> 3:25:48.360]  And it turns out he's one of 2200 celebrities, athletes and European big shots who were not vaccinated but claimed they were and got fake vaccine cards, according to a list compiled by the National Police.
[3:25:48.360 --> 3:25:58.360]  This is in Spain. And he's president of a company that makes the vaccine. So why didn't he want the vaccine?
[3:25:58.360 --> 3:26:08.360]  There's got to be a reason that the president of a big pharma company, a billion dollar giant, doesn't want the vaccine. Something's up here, right?
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:20.360]  It's not too hard to figure out. I've been telling you for a year and a half now, 18 months, vaccine was available in December 2020 and then in mass in the first quarter of 2021.
[3:26:20.360 --> 3:26:27.360]  And I've been telling you from the moment it came out, don't take it, don't take it, don't take it. But unlike government, you can't sue me for saying don't take it.
[3:26:27.360 --> 3:26:33.360]  I'm not forcing you at gunpoint. I'm giving you my opinions and you could take them or leave them.
[3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:43.360]  Government, on the other hand, puts their boot on your neck like a bunch of Nazis or Gestapo or KGB or East German Stasi and they lie to you.
[3:26:43.360 --> 3:26:52.360]  They commit fraud. They withhold information you need to know. They cover up real deaths and real injuries.
[3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:57.360]  They intimidate doctors so doctors cannot tell you anything's wrong or they'll lose their license.
[3:26:57.360 --> 3:27:04.360]  You know, here's something I'm going to inform you about. Most people don't know. Doctors are human beings just like you and me.
[3:27:04.360 --> 3:27:09.360]  And just like you and me, they need their income. Most doctors are broke. Did you know that?
[3:27:09.360 --> 3:27:14.360]  Almost every doctor makes like now, used to be like a million dollars a year, half a million a year.
[3:27:14.360 --> 3:27:20.360]  Now because of Obamacare, they've been cut in half. So doctors now make about 150 to 250 a year.
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:25.360]  Do you know what a PA makes, a physician's assistant? 150 a year for not going to medical school.
[3:27:25.360 --> 3:27:33.360]  Most doctors barely or don't at all make as much money as a PA. But even if they make more and they make 250 or 500,000,
[3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:39.360]  they live on that money each year, spend it, and then with kids in college, next year they've got to make it again.
[3:27:39.360 --> 3:27:46.360]  You take a doctor living in a nice house or even a mansion with a fancy car or two in the driveway and two kids in college,
[3:27:46.360 --> 3:27:50.360]  he needs his $250,000 income to keep doing that.
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:57.360]  So if he loses his license, his family's ruined, his kids have to drop out of college. Instead of driving a Mercedes or a Porsche,
[3:27:57.360 --> 3:28:03.360]  he'll be driving a Ugo pretty soon and he'll be collecting unemployment insurance and he won't be able to eat.
[3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:10.360]  So of course doctors are scared of losing their medical license. If you say anything about the vaccine killing people,
[3:28:10.360 --> 3:28:17.360]  you'll be up on charges and lose your license. If you say anything or dare to prescribe ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:21.360]  or mentioned vitamins, you'll be up on charges and lose your license.
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:28.360]  All of those are the only things that work against COVID. All the experts tell me, all the holistic experts.
[3:28:28.360 --> 3:28:35.360]  Vitamins work, vitamin D works, dramatically. Vitamin C works, Z-quarks, Koursten works, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine work.
[3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.360]  If you mention them, you lose your medical license. Incredible times we live in.
[3:28:40.360 --> 3:28:47.360]  All right, we're headed to a break. RootForAmerica.com is my website. WayneRoot.com is my email and my book,
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:29:11.360]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book. We'll be right back. WayneL Root, Alex Jones Show.

[3:31:54.360 --> 3:32:01.360]  Introducing Come and Take It, our third and final coin, a part of the founding member collector series.
[3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:07.360]  This third coin is minted into existence from.999 Silver from right here in America.
[3:32:07.360 --> 3:32:11.360]  Come and Take It may hold meaning for Americans from recent history,
[3:32:11.360 --> 3:32:19.360]  but it actually dates back to being used in 480BC in the Battle of Thermopylae as Molon Lape by Spartan King Leonidas.
[3:32:19.360 --> 3:32:25.360]  It has since become a symbol of defiance here in America along with the imagery of a black star and cannon
[3:32:25.360 --> 3:32:29.360]  in the flag used by Texans during the state's revolution against Mexico.
[3:32:29.360 --> 3:32:33.360]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase,
[3:32:33.360 --> 3:32:38.360]  with one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of Come and Take It
[3:32:38.360 --> 3:32:44.360]  and the reverse side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription Free Men Bear Arms.
[3:32:44.360 --> 3:32:49.360]  Go to 1776coin.com today to secure your founding member coin.
[3:32:49.360 --> 3:32:54.360]  Hurry before they're gone as there will only be 10,000 in existence.
[3:32:56.360 --> 3:33:03.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:03.360 --> 3:33:13.360]  All right, Wayne Alleruth, here's my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[3:33:13.360 --> 3:33:16.360]  It's not just a book, it's a resource guide.
[3:33:16.360 --> 3:33:22.360]  It's got all the information on the 116 most woke liberal companies in America that you need to boycott,
[3:33:22.360 --> 3:33:27.360]  stop buying their products and contact them and let them know why you're not buying their products anymore
[3:33:27.360 --> 3:33:31.360]  because they're liberal, they're woke, they're stupid, they're ignorant, and they're destroying America
[3:33:31.360 --> 3:33:35.360]  and you need to put them out of business, but you need to tell them why.
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:37.360]  In other words, you can't just stop buying Disney.
[3:33:37.360 --> 3:33:38.360]  That's good.
[3:33:38.360 --> 3:33:43.360]  I mean, I can't wait for the next quarterly report by Disney that shows their businesses down by 25%.
[3:33:43.360 --> 3:33:49.360]  That'll be great, 15%, 40%, I don't know, it'll range, but it'll be good, it'll be down,
[3:33:49.360 --> 3:33:54.360]  but you need to send them a note to let them know why you're not buying for them anymore
[3:33:54.360 --> 3:33:57.360]  and that will make sure the CEO gets in the back of his mind.
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:02.360]  And I give you the CEO's name, the board of directors name, all the information you need to contact them,
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:05.360]  phone number, email, social media, etc.
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:07.360]  Great Patriot protest to boycott book.
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:11.360]  All right, so I wrote a column that was my nationally syndicated newspaper column.
[3:34:11.360 --> 3:34:14.360]  You find things like this in my website, Root for America.
[3:34:14.360 --> 3:34:15.360]  And I want to read it to you.
[3:34:15.360 --> 3:34:19.360]  It came out this weekend as syndicated around the country by Creator Syndicate.
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:27.360]  The 14 lessons every conservative patriot learned from the tragic Texas school shooting.
[3:34:27.360 --> 3:34:33.360]  Hint, Democrats will be shocked and horrified by the things we believe in.
[3:34:33.360 --> 3:34:36.360]  Everyone has heard about the terrible tragic Texas school shooting.
[3:34:36.360 --> 3:34:42.360]  As usual, Democrats see this as an opportunity to blame guns and Republicans.
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:46.360]  They will demand gun ban, strict gun control and gun confiscation.
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:48.360]  So what else is new?
[3:34:48.360 --> 3:34:51.360]  I didn't add this to the article, but I can add it right now on TV.
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:56.360]  Thank goodness he wasn't white because if the killer was white instead of Hispanic,
[3:34:56.360 --> 3:35:02.360]  this would be an anti-white rage by Democrats in addition to guns and Republicans.
[3:35:02.360 --> 3:35:07.360]  So like Democrats pray all day and night that every killer will be white.
[3:35:07.360 --> 3:35:09.360]  Every mass shooter will be white.
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:16.360]  Never mentioning that in every big city in America, almost every murder is of an innocent black person by a black criminal.
[3:35:16.360 --> 3:35:20.360]  It's interesting that 19 dead kids is horrible, horrible.
[3:35:20.360 --> 3:35:22.360]  It's unthinkable.
[3:35:22.360 --> 3:35:24.360]  There's no one that could don't it.
[3:35:24.360 --> 3:35:26.360]  There's no one that could say it's not a big deal.
[3:35:26.360 --> 3:35:28.360]  There's no one that could say we'll move past it.
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:30.360]  19 dead kids.
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:34.360]  So let me say that's horrendous.
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:37.360]  It's mind-blowing how horrible it is.
[3:35:37.360 --> 3:35:44.360]  But every single weekend in Chicago, 75 people get shot, 19 of them are dead and they're all black.
[3:35:44.360 --> 3:35:46.360]  That may be an issue.
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:48.360]  Is that not mass murder?
[3:35:48.360 --> 3:35:54.360]  It's just by 75 separate shooters and the 19 dead or 19 separate shooters instead of one mass shooting by one shooter.
[3:35:54.360 --> 3:36:00.360]  So this goes on every weekend in every big city in America and there's no Black Lives Matter protest,
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:04.360]  no liberal protest, no President Biden says nothing about it.
[3:36:04.360 --> 3:36:06.360]  No Democrats says anything about it.
[3:36:06.360 --> 3:36:08.360]  The Democrats in the district say nothing about it.
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.360]  No one does anything about it.
[3:36:10.360 --> 3:36:15.360]  It's far worse when you ended up in every city across 365 days each year.
[3:36:15.360 --> 3:36:20.360]  Far worse than the few, thank God, mass murders in America.
[3:36:20.360 --> 3:36:24.360]  What are they like, 15 a year that make the news that really are mass murders?
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:28.360]  They consider liberals anything like two or more is a mass murder.
[3:36:28.360 --> 3:36:30.360]  But I'm saying what makes the news?
[3:36:30.360 --> 3:36:34.360]  10 people shot, 15 shot, 10 dead, 20 dead.
[3:36:34.360 --> 3:36:36.360]  There's a few of those each year.
[3:36:36.360 --> 3:36:38.360]  Horrible, horrible.
[3:36:38.360 --> 3:36:40.360]  But it's not about guns, it's about mental illness.
[3:36:40.360 --> 3:36:42.360]  But anyway, I segue.
[3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:48.360]  The tragic shooting is just more proof that we live in a country that's bitterly divided,
[3:36:48.360 --> 3:36:54.360]  so divided that the two sides right and left, Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, can't agree on anything.
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:37:00.360]  We appear headed for a divorce because it's clear neither side can live with the other.
[3:37:00.360 --> 3:37:04.360]  There's no way to compromise when two sides see things so differently.
[3:37:04.360 --> 3:37:06.360]  The earth is flat, no, the earth is round.
[3:37:06.360 --> 3:37:08.360]  It's like night and day.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:14.360]  It's almost as if Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Uranus.
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:20.360]  Here are the 14 lessons I've learned from the tragedy at the Texas school last week.
[3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:26.360]  I'm certain tens of millions of conservatives and Trump voters and patriots see it the exact same way.
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:28.360]  Want to bet?
[3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:30.360]  Number one, guns aren't the problem.
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:32.360]  Gun-free zones are the problem.
[3:37:32.360 --> 3:37:34.360]  They are killing fields.
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:42.360]  They are open invitations for mentally deranged criminals and criminally insane madmen to walk in and start shooting.
[3:37:42.360 --> 3:37:48.360]  Gun-free signs outside of school or church are like a blinking neon sign in Vegas.
[3:37:48.360 --> 3:37:52.360]  Blinking and screaming, come on in and kill us.
[3:37:52.360 --> 3:37:56.360]  We're defenseless. We can't shoot back.
[3:37:56.360 --> 3:38:00.360]  Number two, guns didn't cause this tragedy, but a good guy with a gun sure ended it.
[3:38:00.360 --> 3:38:05.360]  An armed border agent killed the bad guy thereby saving lives and that should be the headline.
[3:38:05.360 --> 3:38:10.360]  Number three, we need more good guys and gals with guns to stop bad guys.
[3:38:10.360 --> 3:38:12.360]  Every school needs armed security.
[3:38:12.360 --> 3:38:17.360]  There should be only a single point of entry to every school and a guard must always protect that entrance.
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:21.360]  All other doors to the school should be locked and secured.
[3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:27.360]  Number four, backing up armed security at every school should be teachers and or administrators
[3:38:27.360 --> 3:38:31.360]  who are armed with guns and professional gun training.
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:33.360]  Number five, how can we afford all this?
[3:38:33.360 --> 3:38:39.360]  I've argued from day one it was a disastrous decision and a tragic mistake to give another 40 billion to Ukraine.
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:46.360]  As a matter of fact, I argued that the first 20 billion or so that we gave in one trunch was a tragic mistake
[3:38:46.360 --> 3:38:52.360]  and that the first 40 billion in total we gave to them in pieces including that 20 billion trunch mistake
[3:38:52.360 --> 3:38:54.360]  and then the next 40 billion tragic mistake.
[3:38:54.360 --> 3:38:57.360]  We need to worry about America first.
[3:38:57.360 --> 3:38:59.360]  We could have used that 40 billion here at home.
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:04.360]  Half of it, 20 billion, should have been used to pay for armed security at every school in America.
[3:39:04.360 --> 3:39:08.360]  And if we really want to protect children, secure the border.
[3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:16.360]  The other half of that 40 billion, i.e. 20 billion, should have been used to build and secure the wall on our southern border.
[3:39:16.360 --> 3:39:22.360]  If you're angry and shocked as a nation about 19 innocent young children dying in that school shooting,
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:30.360]  shouldn't we be even more concerned with tens of thousands of American kids dying each year from drug overdoses
[3:39:30.360 --> 3:39:33.360]  with drugs brought across that border?
[3:39:33.360 --> 3:39:37.360]  Everything that comes over that border is a threat to America's children.
[3:39:37.360 --> 3:39:48.360]  Drugs, human traffickers, child sex traffickers, pedophiles and tons of vicious violent criminals, gangbangers and MS-13 murderers.
[3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:53.360]  Why didn't we use that Ukraine money to save thousands of kids' lives by securing the border?
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:56.360]  Number seven, gun control is never the answer.
[3:39:56.360 --> 3:40:00.360]  Gun control is a massive failure everywhere it's ever been tried.
[3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:07.360]  There are far more shootings, violent crimes and murders in Democrat-run cities with strict gun control than anywhere else.
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:09.360]  Why is that? The answer is simple.
[3:40:09.360 --> 3:40:13.360]  Strict gun control never stops criminals. They buy their guns illegally.
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:15.360]  It just leaves the good people defenseless.
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:20.360]  Number eight, new gun laws will do nothing to stop crime or mass murders.
[3:40:20.360 --> 3:40:24.360]  What we need to do is enforce the laws already on the books,
[3:40:24.360 --> 3:40:32.360]  but it is Democrat districts that allow all the criminals back on the street and almost every crime is committed by a repeat offender.
[3:40:32.360 --> 3:40:39.360]  Number nine, instead of useless new laws, why don't we make mass murder the killing of two or more, a death penalty crime,
[3:40:39.360 --> 3:40:48.360]  and if convicted of mass murder, there are no appeals and you get shot by firing squad the next morning after you're found guilty by a jury of your peers.
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:40:53.360]  Number ten, investigate big pharma, not the gun companies, big pharma.
[3:40:53.360 --> 3:41:00.360]  For the drugs they pump into young males for depression, anger issues, attention deficit disorder and mental illness,
[3:41:00.360 --> 3:41:05.360]  virtually every mass killer in recent memory was on these drugs.
[3:41:05.360 --> 3:41:09.360]  The side effects of these drugs are suicidal thoughts and violent thoughts.
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:12.360]  Why are we drugging all of our male teenagers in school?
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:15.360]  Number 11, never mention to fund police to me again.
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:20.360]  Instances like this prove we need more police and more funding for police, not less.
[3:41:20.360 --> 3:41:23.360]  Number 12, as much as I love and appreciate the police.
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:26.360]  Boy, did they fail miserably this time.
[3:41:26.360 --> 3:41:29.360]  There are many questions about how the police responded to this school shooting.
[3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:36.360]  How could they stand around for an hour or 90 minutes knowing that kids were being shot, knowing that gunfire was going off,
[3:41:36.360 --> 3:41:39.360]  knowing that kids were bleeding to death and doing nothing.
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:44.360]  Did they actually run into the school, by the way, and get their own kids out while leaving everybody else's kids to die?
[3:41:44.360 --> 3:41:46.360]  Did cops do that?
[3:41:46.360 --> 3:41:49.360]  And were they afraid of walking into the school and getting shot?
[3:41:49.360 --> 3:41:51.360]  That's what a police chief said.
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:53.360]  Hey, we were afraid of getting shot.
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:56.360]  If you're afraid of getting shot, you need to find another profession.
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:42:02.360]  Every cop afraid of getting shot, you need to be indicted right now or certainly fired from their job.
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:04.360]  That's their job.
[3:42:04.360 --> 3:42:09.360]  So please, no more defend police, but let's also rethink how we're hiring and training cops.
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:12.360]  We need heroic macho warriors as cops.
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:19.360]  Stop trying to make them into poets, politically correct pansies, and social workers.
[3:42:19.360 --> 3:42:23.360]  I've got a 13 and 14 to finish up running out of time in this segment.
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:25.360]  I'll do it to start the next segment.
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:28.360]  13 and 14 lessons that you'll want to hear.
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:34.360]  The final crescendo from the lessons we learned from the school shooting in Texas by Wayne Allyn Root.
[3:42:34.360 --> 3:42:35.360]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:43.360]  Root for america.com, Wayne Root at gmail.com, and my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[3:42:43.360 --> 3:42:56.360]  Be right back on The Alex Jones Show.
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:20.360]  It is used in 480 B.C. in the Battle of Thermopylae as Molon Lopay by Spartan King Leonidas.
[3:43:20.360 --> 3:43:26.360]  It has since become a symbol of defiance here in America along with the imagery of a black star and cannon
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:30.360]  in the flag used by Texans during the state's revolution against Mexico.
[3:43:30.360 --> 3:43:34.360]  Both sides of the coin depict these historical uses of the phrase,
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:39.360]  with one side having a rendition of a Spartan helmet and the inscription of come and take it
[3:43:39.360 --> 3:43:45.360]  and the other side having a rendition of the cannon and the inscription Free Men Bear Arms.

[3:43:50.360 --> 3:43:57.360]  Hurry before they're gone as there will only be 10,000 in existence.
[3:43:57.360 --> 3:44:10.360]  As you describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public is in,
[3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:14.360]  the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[3:44:14.360 --> 3:44:20.360]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out
[3:44:20.360 --> 3:44:27.360]  or you get lost, you're bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[3:44:27.360 --> 3:44:30.360]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[3:44:30.360 --> 3:44:32.360]  They have stunned us.
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:35.360]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[3:44:35.360 --> 3:44:39.360]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech called The Great New Narrative
[3:44:39.360 --> 3:44:44.360]  where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven
[3:44:44.360 --> 3:44:49.360]  to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[3:44:49.360 --> 3:44:52.360]  And as he said this, they need darkness to thrive.
[3:44:52.360 --> 3:45:19.360]  That is an amazing organization that we have partnered with who is helping us purchase more products in the future
[3:45:19.360 --> 3:45:22.360]  with free world outlet.com.

[3:47:11.360 --> 3:47:13.360]  Wayne Allyn Root back again.
[3:47:13.360 --> 3:47:15.360]  The Root, the Root, the Root's on fire.
[3:47:15.360 --> 3:47:18.360]  Coming to you from the house that Root built in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:22.360]  And broadcast all over the United States by info wars.
[3:47:22.360 --> 3:47:25.360]  And Alex Jones, honored to be on the show.
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:27.360]  Root4American.com is my website.
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:29.360]  You saw it up on the screen a moment ago.
[3:47:29.360 --> 3:47:32.360]  You can always email me, Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[3:47:32.360 --> 3:47:35.360]  And my book is The Great Patriot Boycott.
[3:47:35.360 --> 3:47:40.360]  The Great Patriot Protestant Boycott Book by Wayne Allyn Root and my co-author by the way,
[3:47:40.360 --> 3:47:43.360]  great guy, Nicky Baloo of Canada.
[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:45.360]  Wow, has Canada gone bad?
[3:47:45.360 --> 3:47:47.360]  Boy, has Canada gone sour?
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:49.360]  Getting ready to ban all guns.
[3:47:49.360 --> 3:47:54.360]  So people are completely helpless when the Gestapo, i.e. Justin Trudeau and his storm troops
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:57.360]  try and take you away for not taking a vaccine.
[3:47:57.360 --> 3:47:59.360]  No guns to defend yourself.
[3:47:59.360 --> 3:48:00.360]  Scary.
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:02.360]  Great Patriot Protestant Boycott Book.
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:06.360]  I was just reading my column that came out this weekend syndicated in newspapers around the country.
[3:48:06.360 --> 3:48:12.360]  The 14 lessons every conservative patriot learned from the tragic Texas school shooting.
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:17.360]  And number 12 was that the police did a poor ass job.
[3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:20.360]  They sucked to put it in street language.
[3:48:20.360 --> 3:48:22.360]  They were horrible.
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:24.360]  And they may get indicted now.
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:27.360]  And I feel bad for them because the average cop is just listening to orders.
[3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:30.360]  But the people in charge who gave the order should all be indicted.
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:35.360]  If you leave children alone in a school while guns are going off to be shot,
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:37.360]  you're a horribly human being.
[3:48:37.360 --> 3:48:39.360]  You don't deserve to be in charge of anything.
[3:48:39.360 --> 3:48:41.360]  You shouldn't be a dog catcher.
[3:48:41.360 --> 3:48:45.360]  You shouldn't be a public administrator, let alone a police chief.
[3:48:45.360 --> 3:48:47.360]  And we've got to take you away from your job.
[3:48:47.360 --> 3:48:49.360]  That's it. You're done. You're done.
[3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:53.360]  If you don't save children's lives, you have no right to call yourself a cop.
[3:48:53.360 --> 3:48:54.360]  All right.
[3:48:54.360 --> 3:48:57.360]  Number 13, 14 key lessons.
[3:48:57.360 --> 3:49:03.360]  Number 13, this mass shooting and the poor police response only is what Democrats don't understand.
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:10.360]  Only makes American conservatives and patriots even more certain it's up to us to defend ourselves
[3:49:10.360 --> 3:49:12.360]  and save our children and our families.
[3:49:12.360 --> 3:49:16.360]  We love the police, but we can never count on them.
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:18.360]  If it is to be, it is up to me.
[3:49:18.360 --> 3:49:20.360]  I learned that saying in high school.
[3:49:20.360 --> 3:49:22.360]  If it is to be, it's up to me.
[3:49:22.360 --> 3:49:23.360]  You know what taught me that saying?
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:26.360]  When I was a kid in high school, we had a congressman,
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:31.360]  Joe DiGuardio, I believe was his name, or Joe DiGuardi in Westchester County, New York,
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:33.360]  representing the Marinak area.
[3:49:33.360 --> 3:49:37.360]  He taught me that saying, if it is to be, it's up to me.
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:39.360]  You got to do it yourself.
[3:49:39.360 --> 3:49:46.360]  So I'll bet more guns and more ammunition is bought in the coming months by Americans
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:49.360]  than ever before in the history of America.
[3:49:49.360 --> 3:49:51.360]  Liberals think, oh my God, this ends guns.
[3:49:51.360 --> 3:49:53.360]  Nobody wants guns anymore.
[3:49:53.360 --> 3:49:57.360]  No, everybody wants guns because we all realize that they're going to try and ban them
[3:49:57.360 --> 3:49:59.360]  and we got to protect ourselves right now.
[3:49:59.360 --> 3:50:01.360]  Number 14, and the police can't help us.
[3:50:01.360 --> 3:50:04.360]  Number 14, one final point.
[3:50:04.360 --> 3:50:06.360]  Actually, it's a pledge.
[3:50:06.360 --> 3:50:08.360]  Stop trying to take our guns.
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:10.360]  This isn't Australia.
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:11.360]  This isn't Austria.
[3:50:11.360 --> 3:50:13.360]  This isn't New Zealand.
[3:50:13.360 --> 3:50:16.360]  This is America, and you're never taking our guns.
[3:50:16.360 --> 3:50:21.360]  As in never, never, never, ever, ever.
[3:50:21.360 --> 3:50:27.360]  You'll only take our guns from our cold, dead hands, as Charlton Heston once said.
[3:50:27.360 --> 3:50:30.360]  So stop wasting your time.
[3:50:30.360 --> 3:50:32.360]  Stop your demands.
[3:50:32.360 --> 3:50:35.360]  You may not know it yet, but you've already lost this battle.
[3:50:35.360 --> 3:50:37.360]  We're never giving up our guns.
[3:50:37.360 --> 3:50:43.360]  I repeat, never giving up our guns because as Thomas Jefferson and the founding fathers,
[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:48.360]  the wisest men that ever lived, oh, I know, they were white.
[3:50:48.360 --> 3:50:50.360]  That's a knock.
[3:50:50.360 --> 3:50:52.360]  You can't be white and wise.
[3:50:52.360 --> 3:50:59.360]  And I know it was 1776, it was a long time ago, wisest group of men in the history of the world
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:04.360]  who created the greatest constitution, the greatest bill of rights, and the greatest country,
[3:51:04.360 --> 3:51:10.360]  and the greatest capitalist system in the history of civilization of any country ever existing
[3:51:10.360 --> 3:51:12.360]  and ever blessed by God.
[3:51:12.360 --> 3:51:19.360]  And Thomas Jefferson and all his founding fathers all believed you need a gun to protect yourself from bad guys,
[3:51:19.360 --> 3:51:24.360]  but mostly you need a gun to protect yourself from the government, your own government.
[3:51:24.360 --> 3:51:29.360]  And that's true now, more than it's ever been true, more than it's ever been true.
[3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:37.360]  So these are the 14 common sense lessons millions of conservative patriots learned from this tragic mass shooting.
[3:51:37.360 --> 3:51:41.360]  I know Democrats will be shocked and horrified by what we believe in.
[3:51:41.360 --> 3:51:44.360]  That's why it may be time for a divorce.
[3:51:44.360 --> 3:51:46.360]  This marriage is not working.
[3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:48.360]  We'll keep America.
[3:51:48.360 --> 3:51:53.360]  It's time for all of you that want to ban guns to go back to Uranus.
[3:51:53.360 --> 3:51:56.360]  I'm way down the route, being a little funny and a little wise ass there.
[3:51:56.360 --> 3:51:59.360]  We're from Mars and you're from Uranus.
[3:51:59.360 --> 3:52:00.360]  No question about it.
[3:52:00.360 --> 3:52:02.360]  Listen, we're not giving up our guns.
[3:52:02.360 --> 3:52:03.360]  It's not going to happen.
[3:52:03.360 --> 3:52:04.360]  So stop talking about it.
[3:52:04.360 --> 3:52:05.360]  Stop thinking about it.
[3:52:05.360 --> 3:52:11.360]  Here's the kind of crazy people I opened the show by telling you about the head of the FDA's approval process
[3:52:11.360 --> 3:52:16.360]  for new drugs at 3 in the morning taken by police to a mental institution,
[3:52:16.360 --> 3:52:19.360]  which is so far for the course and so perfect.
[3:52:19.360 --> 3:52:20.360]  Now I got to read you this one.
[3:52:20.360 --> 3:52:26.360]  A Boston University professor says that owning property is racist.
[3:52:26.360 --> 3:52:36.360]  A Boston University professor deemed property racist while defending riots where the BLM rioters destroyed property,
[3:52:36.360 --> 3:52:39.360]  burned it, looted it, ripped it off.
[3:52:39.360 --> 3:52:41.360]  All that's fine.
[3:52:41.360 --> 3:52:44.360]  In the aftermath of George Floyd's death.
[3:52:44.360 --> 3:52:51.360]  They were looting themselves from slavery according to this professor at Boston University.
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:53.360]  It's not that they were stealing.
[3:52:53.360 --> 3:52:55.360]  It's not that they were doing bad things.
[3:52:55.360 --> 3:53:03.360]  It's not that they're absolutely criminals and thugs and pieces of garbage never taught right from wrong by mommy and daddy.
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:06.360]  And don't think anything I'm saying is racist because plenty of black lives matter.
[3:53:06.360 --> 3:53:07.360]  People are white.
[3:53:07.360 --> 3:53:13.360]  Matter of fact, I would argue the majority of black lives matter is white, bleeding heart,
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:17.360]  liberals who are suffering from white guilt their whole life.
[3:53:17.360 --> 3:53:20.360]  They're just guilty and they hate themselves for being white.
[3:53:20.360 --> 3:53:22.360]  That's about half of black lives matter.
[3:53:22.360 --> 3:53:28.360]  And the other half are black radical revolutionaries who want to overthrow this country or loot the country to death.
[3:53:28.360 --> 3:53:30.360]  That's great, right?
[3:53:30.360 --> 3:53:32.360]  Her name is Grundy.
[3:53:32.360 --> 3:53:34.360]  See if I could find her name.
[3:53:34.360 --> 3:53:38.360]  Professor Cida Grundy from Boston University.
[3:53:38.360 --> 3:53:45.360]  She urged people not to judge communities reactions and listen to them to address their needs.
[3:53:45.360 --> 3:53:51.360]  We hear President Biden say, I understand your frustrations, but don't destroy property, Grundy says.
[3:53:51.360 --> 3:54:04.360]  Well, when you say to black people who have historically been property, one of our greatest weapons against injustice was the looting of property from the system of slavery.
[3:54:04.360 --> 3:54:13.360]  And the system of slavery, you know, no one on TV is more perfect to respond to this than I am because I'm Jewish.
[3:54:13.360 --> 3:54:17.360]  100% Jewish to Jewish parents, four Jewish grandparents.
[3:54:17.360 --> 3:54:22.360]  And when I spit in the cup and sent it away for DNA analysis, guess what?
[3:54:22.360 --> 3:54:27.360]  It came back 99.9% Eastern European Jew.
[3:54:27.360 --> 3:54:34.360]  I'm as Jewish as you get other than the fact I was raised in 100% Italian mafia neighborhood.
[3:54:34.360 --> 3:54:38.360]  And I believe I'm actually Italian by nature versus Jewish by nature.
[3:54:38.360 --> 3:54:41.360]  So yes, born 100% Jewish.
[3:54:41.360 --> 3:54:43.360]  And what is Jewish history?
[3:54:43.360 --> 3:54:46.360]  Nothing but slavery.
[3:54:46.360 --> 3:54:53.360]  Not like black people slavery for one period of America, but Jews have been slaves throughout history all over the world.
[3:54:53.360 --> 3:54:57.360]  Egypt, Roman Empire, you name it, we were slaves.
[3:54:57.360 --> 3:55:02.360]  We were basically slaves in the old Soviet Union until we ran away to Israel, right?
[3:55:02.360 --> 3:55:08.360]  Nazi journey and Egypt and Roman Empire all treated Jews like garbage.
[3:55:08.360 --> 3:55:12.360]  And then the Holocaust far closer to today than slavery.
[3:55:12.360 --> 3:55:15.360]  And I don't sit around talking about it all day.
[3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:17.360]  I don't sit around thinking about it all day.
[3:55:17.360 --> 3:55:24.360]  As a matter of fact, when the day I was born, my parents taught me in America, you're going to do great, study hard, graduate top your class.
[3:55:24.360 --> 3:55:26.360]  You'll go to an Ivy League school. I did Columbia University.
[3:55:26.360 --> 3:55:28.360]  And the world is your oyster.
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:31.360]  And from that moment on, I knew everything was going to be great.
[3:55:31.360 --> 3:55:34.360]  Who cares if I'm Jewish? Who cares if you're black?
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:36.360]  I went to a black high school, by the way, and I made it.
[3:55:36.360 --> 3:55:38.360]  And if you didn't, it's not because you're black.
[3:55:38.360 --> 3:55:46.360]  It's because you didn't study, because you fooled around too much, because you got a chick pregnant, because you played too much basketball, because you played too much.
[3:55:46.360 --> 3:55:48.360]  Well, I was studying, because you went to too many parties.
[3:55:48.360 --> 3:55:51.360]  Well, I was studying. That's why you didn't make it.
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:53.360]  Color your skin has literally nothing to do with it.
[3:55:53.360 --> 3:55:56.360]  I won't say zero. I'll say that's five percent.
[3:55:56.360 --> 3:56:03.360]  Ninety-five percent is your work ethic and your attitude, hopefully positive, and what you bring to the ball game.
[3:56:03.360 --> 3:56:10.360]  Okay? And if people of color would understand that, they would change their entire outcomes in life.
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:12.360]  It's all about attitude.
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:18.360]  And Jews, the prejudice against Jews and the hatred against Jews has never been higher than it is very moment.
[3:56:18.360 --> 3:56:25.360]  And the history of Jews, bad or worse than any race or any religion or any creed in the history of mankind.
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:28.360]  And yet Jews continue to make it big.
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:31.360]  Make it big. They make it in every profession.
[3:56:31.360 --> 3:56:39.360]  Lawyers, doctors, architects, stockbrokers, investment bankers, the head of media corporations, the head of building all the Hollywood companies.
[3:56:39.360 --> 3:56:43.360]  You don't worry about what the color of your skin is or what your religion is.
[3:56:43.360 --> 3:56:45.360]  You fight and you attack relentlessly.
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:50.360]  And in America, anything is possible and nothing is impossible.
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:53.360]  That's why I wrote the book, The Power of Relentless.
[3:56:53.360 --> 3:56:58.360]  That's my favorite book of all time, The Power of Relentless by Wayne Allen Root.
[3:56:58.360 --> 3:57:03.360]  Go grab a copy at Amazon. It'll teach you how to be successful in life.

[3:57:09.360 --> 3:57:18.360]  My book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, with a list of the 116 most woke, liberal and racist radical and communist companies in America
[3:57:18.360 --> 3:57:23.360]  that get rich because we buy their products and then spit in our faces and screw us over.
[3:57:23.360 --> 3:57:28.360]  Here's how we get revenge and take back America, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:31.360]  And I've got all their names and all their contact information.
