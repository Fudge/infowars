[00:00.000 --> 00:20.080]  Further escalation of the war, whether by accident or design, threatens all of humanity.
[00:20.080 --> 00:25.120]  Raising the alert of Russian nuclear forces is a bone-chilling development.
[00:25.120 --> 00:32.120]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[00:56.120 --> 01:07.120]  The third scenario is a South China Sea Taiwan-Hong Kong crisis being kicked off there that could happen between Vietnam and the Philippines against China.
[01:07.120 --> 01:16.120]  Anything could kick it off where you already see skirmishes going on over these drilling rigs in the South China Sea and other areas, the artificial islands the Chinese are building.
[01:16.120 --> 01:31.120]  So that's where the world is right now, that's the reality. So when you see leftists calling for war and when you see right-wingers calling for war and all this idiocy, you know the old saying, World War III will be fought with nuclear weapons, World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.120]  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggesting the Russian people get rid of him.
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.120]  You need to take this guy out by any means possible.
[01:39.120 --> 01:49.120]  Putin is trying to fake the trap so that we go in and that could be the beginning of World War III.
[01:49.120 --> 01:55.120]  Putin is totally irresponsible using weapons that are not allowed under the Geneva Convention.
[01:55.120 --> 02:01.120]  Putin who threatens using chemical weapons, nuclear and the rest.
[02:01.120 --> 02:10.120]  Myself when I see those tanks, those 40 miles of tanks, I like to take out those tanks.
[02:10.120 --> 02:19.120]  I mean I think there are a couple of them having more planes might be useful but I'm not a military strategist.
[02:19.120 --> 02:29.120]  And Russia now announcing they're likely to ban exports of wheat and oats and buckwheat and other grains all the way through June 30th.
[02:29.120 --> 02:35.120]  And that's on top of of course Ukraine banning the exports of all those grains and hungry banning exports of wheat.
[02:35.120 --> 02:42.120]  Why is this happening? Because these countries know that there's a global shortage and that they have to protect their domestic supply.
[02:42.120 --> 02:46.120]  Now China was very smart about this strategically.
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.120]  They bought up grain supplies around the world over the last let's say eight months or so.
[02:51.120 --> 02:58.120]  They're sitting on about 18 months of wheat right now but the United States does not have really a strategic grain supply.
[02:58.120 --> 03:07.120]  We're going to be facing severe shortages and price inflation in the grocery stores hitting the US in the second half of this year.
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.120]  Accelerating from about August all the way through the end of the year.
[03:11.120 --> 03:21.120]  But I think what we're going to see in the United States is that the prices will get so high on not only grains but then meat and dairy and eggs.
[03:21.120 --> 03:25.120]  Because all of those products come from animals that are fed the grains.
[03:25.120 --> 03:30.120]  So most of the grains in the world are actually grown to feed animals not to feed people.
[03:30.120 --> 03:34.120]  So we're going to see huge increases in meat prices beyond what we've seen already.
[03:34.120 --> 03:42.120]  So flash mobs are going to start looting grocery stores in huge numbers and stealing the meat primarily.
[03:42.120 --> 03:52.120]  But just the food rationing they will have to implement food rationing passports which is a mark of the beast system to verify your identity.
[03:52.120 --> 03:59.120]  It might be a face scan, an iris scan, a thumb print scan or maybe just your mobile phone that's tied to your identity.
[03:59.120 --> 04:05.120]  There's going to be more stimulus money handed out and the money to buy groceries.
[04:05.120 --> 04:08.120]  There's going to be at least 10 million more Americans put on food stamps.
[04:08.120 --> 04:19.120]  Eventually maybe in 23 or 24 they'll say that if you want to buy food under the food rationing system you must use the central bank digital dollar control system.
[04:19.120 --> 04:26.120]  And that's how they're going to starve people into the mark of the beast Federal Reserve crypto system controlled by the government.
[04:26.120 --> 04:30.120]  So they're going to say we're terrorists and we're Russian sympathizers.
[04:30.120 --> 04:41.120]  So this is all a way to internationally take over, create a global crisis on the heels of the police state already set up under COVID-19
[04:41.120 --> 04:44.120]  and now just roll that in to outlaw their opposition.
[04:44.120 --> 04:50.120]  So this is banking technocratic fifth six-generational warfare economic against the people.
[04:50.120 --> 05:18.120]  It's called the Great Reset Build Back Better.
[05:20.120 --> 05:29.120]  With concentrated meat extract, you can get the high levels of butane, nitrates and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver,
[05:29.120 --> 05:35.120]  athletic performance, blood vessels and more.
[05:35.120 --> 05:37.120]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot.
[05:37.120 --> 05:49.120]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K and more.
[05:49.120 --> 06:11.120]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat from Infowars Life today.
[06:11.120 --> 06:21.120]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:21.120 --> 06:23.120]  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:23.120 --> 06:25.120]  Welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[06:25.120 --> 06:31.120]  This wartime broadcast brought to you live from the Infowars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.120]  I'm Harrison Smith sitting in momentarily for Alex Jones.
[06:34.120 --> 06:35.120]  He is in the building.
[06:35.120 --> 06:40.120]  He's taking care of some legal stuff right now, but he will be taking over just as soon as possible.
[06:40.120 --> 06:50.120]  But for now, let me give you a little outlook as to how close we are to nuclear annihilation.
[06:50.120 --> 06:57.120]  How close to the precipice we are before taking that plunge off the cliff that will destroy all of humanity.
[06:57.120 --> 06:59.120]  It's not looking good, folks.
[06:59.120 --> 07:03.120]  Before I do that, let me tell you Happy St. Patrick's Day, everybody.
[07:03.120 --> 07:06.120]  Hope you're all doing well. Hope you're wearing green.
[07:06.120 --> 07:08.120]  If not, I hope you get pinched.
[07:08.120 --> 07:17.120]  Now's the time for celebrating the glorious work of one of the most powerful evangelists that Christianity ever saw.
[07:17.120 --> 07:27.120]  It's worth taking a quick moment to tell you the story of St. Patrick because it's a great source of inspiration for what we're doing here in the Infowar.
[07:27.120 --> 07:29.120]  St. Patrick was from Britain.
[07:29.120 --> 07:33.120]  He was part of a Romanized British family.
[07:33.120 --> 07:35.120]  His father was a deacon in the church.
[07:35.120 --> 07:41.120]  But as a young man, he was captured and taken to Ireland, which was at the time completely pagan, where he was kept as a slave.
[07:41.120 --> 07:47.120]  And he was abused as a slave, and he lived a life as a slave until he got a vision from God that told him,
[07:47.120 --> 07:51.120]  Your boat's here. Your ride is waiting. It's time for you to escape.
[07:51.120 --> 07:55.120]  And trusting his vision, he went to the coast and found a ship waiting there.
[07:55.120 --> 07:58.120]  It took him to England where, again, his troubles were not over.
[07:58.120 --> 08:00.120]  He was captured multiple times.
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.120]  He eventually made it back to his family.
[08:02.120 --> 08:09.120]  Now, think about this. Put yourself in the mindset of a freed slave who's escaped bondage in Ireland, has escaped the pagans.
[08:09.120 --> 08:13.120]  You've made it out. You live a comfortable life with your family now.
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.120]  What would compel somebody to give up that life, go back into the land where he was enslaved,
[08:19.120 --> 08:25.120]  not to extract retribution, not to enact some revenge fantasy on the people who abused him,
[08:25.120 --> 08:32.120]  but to gift those people with the truth, to tell them the gospel, to convert them to Christianity,
[08:32.120 --> 08:36.120]  to perform miracles for them, and to better their life?
[08:36.120 --> 08:44.120]  Well, St. Patrick's was that man, and his writings have had unbelievable positive effects the world over.
[08:44.120 --> 08:51.120]  And he almost single-handedly converted the entire country of Ireland to Christianity.
[08:51.120 --> 08:59.120]  Ah, it's an infant warrior, folks. That's a single man with nothing but the words that he uses and the truth that he's expressing,
[08:59.120 --> 09:03.120]  changing the destiny of an entire nation and in a way the entire world.
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.120]  It's a man who is freed from bondage and yet doesn't hate those who enslaved him,
[09:08.120 --> 09:17.120]  but did help to bring about the abolition of that entire institution in that country,
[09:17.120 --> 09:22.120]  to change the way that they lived in a way that there were no slaves anymore.
[09:22.120 --> 09:24.120]  He freed all of the slaves by doing that.
[09:24.120 --> 09:28.120]  Of course, he drove out the snakes as well, a number of other legendary figures.
[09:28.120 --> 09:35.120]  And of course, he's known as sort of a Catholic saint because of the Catholic nature and attitude of Ireland,
[09:35.120 --> 09:37.120]  but this was before the schism.
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.120]  I mean, this was back when it was a single unified church, and it's just an incredible story,
[09:42.120 --> 09:50.120]  and it's not some time for you to, you know, put on a green top hat and go get blackout drunk in some party.
[09:50.120 --> 09:52.120]  I mean, it is that too.
[09:52.120 --> 09:54.120]  Nobody's saying don't have fun.
[09:54.120 --> 09:57.120]  But there's a reason that we celebrate these certain holidays.
[09:57.120 --> 10:03.120]  There's a reason that there are certain people in history that we extol and celebrate above others.
[10:03.120 --> 10:06.120]  And again, it's not because they were funny little leprechauns.
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.120]  It's because they went up against the grain, they did something that seemed unbelievable, certainly inadvisable,
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.120]  and yet they succeeded because they had the truth and God on their side,
[10:16.120 --> 10:19.120]  and the effects that they've had on the world have been unbelievably positive.
[10:19.120 --> 10:25.120]  So happy St. Patrick's Day to everybody, and hopefully we can take inspiration from that legendary figure
[10:25.120 --> 10:33.120]  as we engage in our own info war and try to free our own persecutors from the slavery that they themselves
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.120]  are trapped in and impose on others.
[10:36.120 --> 10:38.120]  And somebody needs to point this stuff out.
[10:38.120 --> 10:43.120]  Somebody needs to celebrate what the church is supposed to be teaching,
[10:43.120 --> 10:48.120]  because I'll tell you somebody who's not doing that, a little man named Pope Francis.
[10:48.120 --> 10:50.120]  The story can be found at infowars.com.
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.120]  Pope Francis warns, final catastrophe could extinguish human race.
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.120]  I suggest Pope Francis ask himself a question.
[10:59.120 --> 11:01.120]  Is that what the Bible says?
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.120]  That's not really what the Bible says, is it?
[11:03.120 --> 11:09.120]  No, the Bible actually promises to avoid this type of fate.
[11:09.120 --> 11:15.120]  But maybe he's not so worried about putting forward Christianity as he is about putting forward the great reset.
[11:15.120 --> 11:19.120]  New World Order control paradigm that he seems so eager to participate in.
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.120]  Pope Francis warns that the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine could lead to a final catastrophe
[11:24.120 --> 11:26.120]  that would extinguish the human race.
[11:26.120 --> 11:33.120]  Speaking during his weekly address, the Pope said humanity would have to start from scratch in the event of a thermonuclear war.
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.120]  Saying, quote, our imagination appears increasingly concentrated on the representation of a final catastrophe that will extinguish us.
[11:39.120 --> 11:47.120]  And whether it's climate change, or the death of democracy, or the conflict in Ukraine,
[11:47.120 --> 11:52.120]  everything in the mainstream media has to be portrayed as an existential crisis,
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.120]  because it's not about presenting you with the facts and the truth of the situation,
[11:56.120 --> 12:05.120]  so you can come to an informed decision to how you want your political representatives to behave and face the challenges that we're up against.
[12:05.120 --> 12:13.120]  They have to force you into an emotional do or die, this is it, the walls are crumbling down, panic mode,
[12:13.120 --> 12:19.120]  so you override your logic center and you're willing to do things and willing to allow things that you would never be willing to do or allow
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.120]  in a more stable state of mind.
[12:23.120 --> 12:25.120]  So of course everything has to be a total catastrophe.
[12:25.120 --> 12:31.120]  Of course, climate change isn't something that's happening, that we can take measures to mitigate while at the same time
[12:31.120 --> 12:39.120]  focusing on environmental concerns such as not putting in plastics into the food and water,
[12:39.120 --> 12:43.120]  not using things like atrazine to poison our very food supply.
[12:43.120 --> 12:49.120]  There are things that we could be doing, we could be treating the climate and ecology in a reasonable way,
[12:49.120 --> 12:51.120]  but they don't want that note.
[12:51.120 --> 12:56.120]  They want you to have a tracker on your phone that determines how much carbon you're taking and how much carbon you're worth.
[12:56.120 --> 13:02.120]  They want you not to be able to drive a car anymore and certainly not be able to fill your car up with gas.
[13:02.120 --> 13:07.120]  See, they have their own agenda that they want to pursue and you probably wouldn't be into that agenda
[13:07.120 --> 13:12.120]  unless of course they frame it as, well, you just want everybody to die if you go against us.
[13:12.120 --> 13:14.120]  See, now it's an existential crisis.
[13:14.120 --> 13:15.120]  Now we're panicking.
[13:15.120 --> 13:22.120]  Now we're imposing this mental illness on children and young people by telling them it's your fault.
[13:22.120 --> 13:24.120]  The world is dying and it's your fault.
[13:24.120 --> 13:26.120]  It's all your fault and it's because you're alive.
[13:26.120 --> 13:27.120]  It's because you exist.
[13:27.120 --> 13:29.120]  It's because you have children.
[13:29.120 --> 13:37.120]  You are killing the earth and you have to take any measures and go to any extremity to prevent what you have caused.
[13:37.120 --> 13:44.120]  Forcing you into this mindset where you're willing to do things and allow things that you never would otherwise.
[13:44.120 --> 13:48.120]  And so of course the latest with this is the war in Ukraine.
[13:48.120 --> 13:51.120]  It's another one of these distractions.
[13:51.120 --> 13:53.120]  You could call it a distraction if you want.
[13:53.120 --> 13:58.120]  That's a distraction in one way, but in the other way, you got to keep your eye on it.
[13:58.120 --> 14:01.120]  And this is what we said before Russia invaded Ukraine.
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.120]  We would be talking about the fact that Russia was lining people up on the border of Ukraine.
[14:05.120 --> 14:07.120]  And say, stop talking about that. It's a distraction.
[14:07.120 --> 14:09.120]  They're distracting us from COVID.
[14:09.120 --> 14:11.120]  They're distracting us from the immigration collapse.
[14:11.120 --> 14:16.120]  They're distracting us from the fact they're now calling misinformation, domestic terror.
[14:16.120 --> 14:18.120]  And yes, they are distracting us from all that.
[14:18.120 --> 14:20.120]  They'd rather not have us talk about that.
[14:20.120 --> 14:23.120]  But at the same time, we said it's a distraction that they could activate at any time.
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.120]  It's a distraction for now, but it's also a threat that you have to actually take seriously and pay attention to.
[14:29.120 --> 14:37.120]  So that's what's happening here with Ukraine is, yes, there's a lot of very intense talk meant to force you into a state of fear.
[14:37.120 --> 14:39.120]  Fear is the mind killer, right?
[14:39.120 --> 14:40.120]  That's how they take advantage of you.
[14:40.120 --> 14:42.120]  That's how they know psychologically.
[14:42.120 --> 14:44.120]  This is all one big Psyop, right?
[14:44.120 --> 14:50.120]  This is a psychological operation to force you into a mindset where they can take advantage of you.
[14:50.120 --> 14:53.120]  And that is what they're doing with all this talk of nuclear war.
[14:53.120 --> 14:59.120]  But at the same time, the people in power with their fingers on that big red button are the ones saying this.
[14:59.120 --> 15:08.120]  So it's a distraction that could very, very rapidly become real and actually cause the devastation that they themselves seem so eager to bring about.
[15:08.120 --> 15:10.120]  I mean, after all, what do they want?
[15:10.120 --> 15:11.120]  Depopulation.
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.120]  They want America to no longer be the preeminent power in the world.
[15:16.120 --> 15:24.120]  They want all of this stuff that would come about even more rapidly, should we be involved in some major war?
[15:24.120 --> 15:39.120]  And so once again, just like COVID-19, just like so many other seemingly random disasters, all of the outcomes that your classic problem reaction solution paradigm,
[15:39.120 --> 15:50.120]  they bring about these catastrophes, they bring about COVID, they inoculate you with the fear, then they bring about the vaccine passports and the digital ID and everything they want in any way.
[15:50.120 --> 15:53.120]  They're doing the same thing with Ukraine only this time.
[15:53.120 --> 15:55.120]  We're in the danger of nukes flying.
[15:55.120 --> 16:10.120]  We'll get into that more.
[16:26.120 --> 16:41.120]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[16:41.120 --> 16:43.120]  And none of it can succeed.
[16:43.120 --> 16:48.120]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[16:48.120 --> 16:56.120]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band up video links.
[16:56.120 --> 17:19.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[17:26.120 --> 17:33.120]  Garamaseep, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[17:33.120 --> 17:44.120]  AlphaGPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Koli, and Ginkoli, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.120]  This product is more than twice the servings of our brain force plus as well, so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[17:50.120 --> 17:59.120]  Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of brain force ultra before it is completely sold out at infostore.com.
[17:59.120 --> 18:01.120]  Mike in California, thanks for calling.
[18:01.120 --> 18:05.120]  I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research.
[18:05.120 --> 18:21.120]  Now if you read the actual 2014 legislation, the U.S. government gained of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza, MERS, and SARS viruses.
[18:21.120 --> 18:22.120]  There's nothing about SARS-like viruses and it's a research funding pause.
[18:22.120 --> 18:23.120]  It's not a stop.
[18:23.120 --> 18:24.120]  It's not a prohibition.
[18:24.120 --> 18:27.120]  It's when you come to a four-way intersection, there's the stop sign.
[18:27.120 --> 18:28.120]  You stop.
[18:28.120 --> 18:30.120]  You look both ways and then you proceed.
[18:30.120 --> 18:39.120]  But also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research.
[18:39.120 --> 18:42.120]  So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[18:42.120 --> 18:44.120]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[18:44.120 --> 18:46.120]  You know, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[18:46.120 --> 18:48.120]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[18:48.120 --> 18:52.120]  Because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do.
[18:52.120 --> 18:55.120]  But in the main definition, it's still a gain of function.
[18:55.120 --> 18:57.120]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[18:57.120 --> 18:58.120]  Thank you, Mike.
[18:58.120 --> 18:59.120]  We love you.
[18:59.120 --> 19:04.120]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action, and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[19:04.120 --> 19:14.120]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[19:14.120 --> 19:24.120]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[19:24.120 --> 19:31.120]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening, and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[19:31.120 --> 19:33.120]  But there's only two things to do.
[19:33.120 --> 19:36.120]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.120]  If enough people awaken from the cult spell, then we win.
[19:40.120 --> 19:45.120]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[19:45.120 --> 19:58.120]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods, water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios, and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[20:15.120 --> 20:27.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. This is the Alex Jones Show. I'm Harrison Smith sitting in momentarily for Alex Jones.
[20:27.120 --> 20:32.120]  He is in the building in Eager, I know, to tackle some of the amazing headlines from today.
[20:32.120 --> 20:44.120]  So he will be replacing me very shortly. No need to worry. I'm as eager as you are to tune into the Alex Jones Show to see Alex Jones break down some of the bombshell information
[20:44.120 --> 20:47.120]  that's been revealed today. So that will be happening very soon.
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.120]  In the meantime, know that you can support everything we do here by going to infoorstore.com.
[20:52.120 --> 20:57.120]  And of course, now more than ever, we are under massive attack with more and more coming down the pipe.
[20:57.120 --> 21:03.120]  We need your help to stay afloat. I've said it many times. I mean, this is like an army on the march.
[21:03.120 --> 21:12.120]  The morale is high. The legion is willing, but whether we have that supply chain backing us up, that is our limiting factor.
[21:12.120 --> 21:20.120]  That's what determines how far we go. If we're a car, then the engine is great. The wheels are at full pressure.
[21:20.120 --> 21:27.120]  The foot is on the gas pedal pressing it to the floor. The only thing that determines how far we go is how much gas is in the tank.
[21:27.120 --> 21:32.120]  And it's entirely up to you. I hope that you can support us by going to infoorstore.com right now.

[21:56.120 --> 22:06.120]  They're figuring out on almost a daily basis, it seems. If you just search Vitamin D, you see new and new, more and more new articles discussing what a powerful supplement this is for your daily life.

[22:15.120 --> 22:25.120]  Now let's get into Ukraine and what's going on there. I've got good news and bad news about Ukraine. The good news is, it looks like there may be a peaceable solution on the horizon.
[22:25.120 --> 22:35.120]  It looks like the peace talks are finding compromise and we may be able to see an end to this war without it spiraling into a worldwide global conflict.
[22:35.120 --> 22:48.120]  That's the good news. The bad news is, our country in the western world is run by psychopaths who are very eager to use the justification of war to bring about all sorts of nefarious plans that they wanted to do anyway.
[22:48.120 --> 23:08.120]  That's the bad news. Good news, we might be coming to an end to this. Bad news, we're run by psychopaths. So, of course, the news that came out yesterday that I know Alex dug quite a bit into was that the secret USA CIA training program in Ukraine was exposed by an exclusive at Yahoo News.
[23:08.120 --> 23:21.120]  They helped Kiev prepare for Russian invasion, quietly admitting to the fact that we had been arming and training paramilitary groups in Ukraine for a little under a decade there.
[23:21.120 --> 23:39.120]  Should I really remind you of nothing more than Afghanistan, right, saying during American Journal, wouldn't it be just the most symbolic thing to have like a remake of Rambo? Because, obviously, Hollywood is completely creatively bankrupt at this point, so they can't come up with their news stories.
[23:39.120 --> 23:53.120]  They can't take advantage of name recognition from successful intellectual property of the past. So, maybe they'll remake Rambo. This time it'll be a trans woman playing Rambo, obviously. We got to get that Oscar bid.
[23:53.120 --> 24:05.120]  And maybe at the beginning, it'll have a nice little note saying, you know, this film is dedicated to the brave freedom fighters of the Azov battalion, right, just like they had the Mujahideen in the early 1980s.
[24:05.120 --> 24:12.120]  It's just we're reliving everything again. All the media is regurgitating and all of our foreign policy is a regurgitation.
[24:12.120 --> 24:25.120]  So, can't you see now, best case scenario in Ukraine, 10, 20 years from now, we have to go to war with the Nazi battalions that we have armed, that are trained and armed with our weapons by our deep state.
[24:25.120 --> 24:36.120]  Can't you just see this becoming another Afghanistan in the same way that we funded the Mujahideen and Osama bin Laden to defeat the Soviet incursion of Afghanistan way back in the day?
[24:36.120 --> 24:54.120]  It's just it's a groundhog day of terror. So, that was some of the latest news there, revealing that we have in fact been, you know, had our own little involvement in the collapse of Ukraine in the coming about of this war.
[24:54.120 --> 25:07.120]  But nevertheless, Russia and Ukraine, according to Sergei Lavrov, are close to agreeing on neutral status, peace deal under which Ukraine abandoned its NATO aspirations in return for Russian withdrawal, and Western security guarantees
[25:07.120 --> 25:15.120]  appears to inch closer on Wednesday, even as Vladimir Putin's troops are accused of killing people, queuing for bed in a bread in a northern Ukrainian city.
[25:15.120 --> 25:21.120]  Lavrov says the negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons, but nevertheless, there is some hope of reaching a compromise.
[25:21.120 --> 25:30.120]  Neutral status is now being seriously discussed, seriously, along, of course, with security guarantees, which would be nice.
[25:30.120 --> 25:42.120]  Wouldn't this be nice? And it's one of the striking things that you notice if you listen to the Senate hearing with Victoria Newland or any other hearing or government meeting about Ukraine.
[25:42.120 --> 25:52.120]  Never once does it even enter into conversation what the goals of America are here, that peace could actually be an option on the table.
[25:52.120 --> 26:05.120]  Like, it doesn't even enter into the conception of the people in power, that expanding this out, that encouraging this war, that sending more weapons and more people and no fly zones and airplanes.
[26:05.120 --> 26:13.120]  But is that the best idea? It's not even in their calculus. It's not a component of the algorithm they're running. They don't care.
[26:13.120 --> 26:26.120]  They have their own agenda. They have their own ideas about what can be gained from this conflict. Never once is the actual condition of the Ukrainian people even enter into conversation.
[26:26.120 --> 26:36.120]  I like Victoria Newland. Listen to the questions they asked her. First, it was like, how do we use this war to crack down on cryptocurrencies, since we know cryptocurrency is having an effect in this war?
[26:36.120 --> 26:49.120]  Can we crack down on those? How can we funnel more money to our weapons manufacturers in order to send weapons to Ukraine? How can we use this to bring about digital ID and other things like that?
[26:49.120 --> 26:57.120]  Why are you undermining our attempt to install a puppet president in Venezuela by contacting them?
[26:57.120 --> 27:04.120]  It's like, does anybody want to ask about the people of Ukraine? Anybody want to say, hey, do we want peace or war here? Can we actually talk about this?
[27:04.120 --> 27:18.120]  Can we figure this out? What our goal is? Doesn't even enter into the conversation. They have their own prerogatives and priorities, and they have nothing to do with the American people, the Ukrainian people, the Russian people, or anybody other than themselves.
[27:18.120 --> 27:25.120]  And it's a very dangerous game they're playing, a dangerous game of chicken that we are currently involved in.
[27:25.120 --> 27:39.120]  The possibility of nuclear exchange has not just been talked about. It's been brought into reality with Russia upping its nuclear readiness to the second highest level, just under the actual launching of nukes.
[27:39.120 --> 27:52.120]  And according to Sergey Lavrov, the foreign spokesman, foreign minister of Russia, he says, quote, if the West thinks Russia will step back, it does not understand Russia.
[27:52.120 --> 28:03.120]  In other words, they will not be bullied out of this. They will not submit to this just because Amazon and McDonald's and Coca-Cola decide to pull out of their country.
[28:03.120 --> 28:16.120]  They have goals that they think are in line with their national interests, and they will be pursuing them, regardless of anything that, you know, some limperist weirdo at the State Department has to say.
[28:16.120 --> 28:29.120]  And again, the good news is, according to Slovenia's prime minister, who visited Zelensky in the Ukrainian capital on Tuesday evening, she told the Guardian that a draft framework was being worked on with the Ukrainian's president
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.120]  willing to change the country's constitution to drop hopes of NATO membership. Now, that's a key component of Russia's demand.
[28:35.120 --> 28:53.120]  So again, this could be over. War could be over if you want it. There could be a peaceful solution, and we could let the dust settle, and folks on the people actually trying to enslave this world in a technocratic control system of absolute domination.
[28:53.120 --> 28:59.120]  But the American authorities, they're not going to let that happen so easily. I'll tell you about it on the other side.
[29:23.120 --> 29:34.120]  Coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[29:34.120 --> 29:42.120]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[29:42.120 --> 29:54.120]  In Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very serious situation.
[29:54.120 --> 30:20.120]  Stay tuned to infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[30:20.120 --> 30:26.120]  What is contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[30:26.120 --> 30:37.120]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[30:37.120 --> 30:46.120]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[30:46.120 --> 30:53.120]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[30:53.120 --> 31:18.120]  Next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[32:33.120 --> 32:42.120]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it. One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower,
[32:42.120 --> 32:49.120]  which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[32:49.120 --> 32:55.120]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[32:55.120 --> 33:04.120]  Selling out now at infowarstore.com.
[33:25.120 --> 33:41.120]  Well, what a brilliant quote to start with. Welcome back, folks. This is The Alex Jones Show. I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will be joining us momentarily.
[33:41.120 --> 33:50.120]  We'll be joining you. I'll be with you sitting and watching Alex Jones in just a few minutes. No need to worry about that.
[33:50.120 --> 34:00.120]  I've sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility over all forms of tyranny over the minds of man.
[34:00.120 --> 34:13.120]  It's an appropriate quote for this info war as we have tried to explain over and over. Essentially, the people in power want you to either allow them to do things,
[34:13.120 --> 34:20.120]  or preferably they want your active participation in things that you would never choose to do normally. If you had all the information,
[34:20.120 --> 34:30.120]  if you had the full knowledge of what brought the conditions about that you're now reacting to and what the results of the policies that they're proposing are,
[34:30.120 --> 34:39.120]  you would never go along with this sort of stuff. So how do they get you to go along with it since we don't live in a communist or Nazi style authoritarianism
[34:39.120 --> 34:46.120]  where they can just beat you if you disagree, like they have to manipulate your mind. So the way they do that is they manipulate perception.
[34:46.120 --> 34:54.120]  They control what information you know and how it's presented to you in order to convince you to do things that you otherwise would never do.
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.120]  And then if you're still not happy with what they're doing, they'll just medicate you. And then you'll be happy whether you like it or not.
[35:00.120 --> 35:05.120]  That's the promise of the great reset. That's the promise of, as all this closely put it, the ultimate revolution.
[35:05.120 --> 35:12.120]  The revolution beyond which all other revolutions will be impossible. And that is the ultimate goal of the people in power in our country
[35:12.120 --> 35:21.120]  to bring about this situation where expressing dissent to their demands is inconceivable, not possible, not able to happen,
[35:21.120 --> 35:30.120]  let alone be spread on big tech and mainstream media. And so of course, as they approach any catastrophe, whether it's natural,
[35:30.120 --> 35:42.120]  whether they brought it about, their concern is not how to rectify the situation, not how to best serve the people that they supposedly represent,
[35:42.120 --> 35:48.120]  but it's how to use these situations to their own ends to carry out their own agenda.
[35:48.120 --> 35:59.120]  And that is becoming overwhelmingly obvious, more and more so, as we're introduced to yet another world-threatening catastrophe in Ukraine,
[35:59.120 --> 36:08.120]  once again brought on at least in some part by our own deep state military activities in foreign countries,
[36:08.120 --> 36:15.120]  yet another example of foreign intervention along the same lines we've seen in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya,
[36:15.120 --> 36:22.120]  and a dozen other countries before that inevitably results in the reduction of American power overseas,
[36:22.120 --> 36:33.120]  the bankruptcy and restriction of our rights here at home in the enrichment of those who are pulling the strings.
[36:33.120 --> 36:37.120]  So of course, it looks like we may be on the cusp of peace here.
[36:37.120 --> 36:46.120]  We may be on the precipice of a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Ukraine as they say on both sides,
[36:46.120 --> 36:53.120]  that they're inching closer and closer to a compromise and agreement that would put a stop to the Russian aggression
[36:53.120 --> 37:00.120]  and allow Ukraine to once again be a nation free from foreign influence, either from Russia or from the West.
[37:00.120 --> 37:07.120]  And the UN Security Council is set to vote on this on Friday.
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.120]  It's a Russia-proposed piece of UN legislation.
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.120]  The UN Security Council is due to vote on Friday on a Russian-drafted call for aid, access and civilian protection in Ukraine,
[37:18.120 --> 37:25.120]  but diplomats say the measure is set to fail because it does not push for an end to fighting or withdrawal of Russian troops.
[37:25.120 --> 37:30.120]  Of course, the people in power aren't very interested in bringing this war to an end.
[37:30.120 --> 37:37.120]  They're interested in profiting from it and continuing it as long as possible or as long as necessary to bring about a digital world ID
[37:37.120 --> 37:40.120]  and whatever else they have in mind.
[37:40.120 --> 37:44.120]  As you see here, the U.S. is pressuring India, China and Egypt over Russia.
[37:44.120 --> 37:49.120]  This one's getting according to Sergey Lavrov, according to the Russian Foreign Minister, rather.
[37:49.120 --> 37:54.120]  The U.S. is putting pressure on China, Turkey and a number of other countries due to their cooperation with Russia,
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.120]  but it's just the rudeness that is erupting from Washington.
[37:56.120 --> 38:02.120]  I don't know. It's beyond, he said commenting on U.S. actions against other countries in a TV interview.
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.120]  It's even more striking that this kind of blackmail is used against such ancient civilizations as China, India, Egypt
[38:07.120 --> 38:16.120]  and the demands were made on the same Turks, saying this is a fateful moment, an epical moment, an epochal moment.
[38:16.120 --> 38:25.120]  I'm not sure how to pronounce that, but you get it, a moment of change, a crucible in the history of humanity
[38:25.120 --> 38:30.120]  because it reflects the battle in the broadest sense of the word and how the world order will look.
[38:30.120 --> 38:33.120]  He said in an interview with RBC TV channel.
[38:33.120 --> 38:38.120]  And I said on American Journal, this really just reminds me of how the American regime treats individuals.
[38:38.120 --> 38:40.120]  They treat countries in the same way.
[38:40.120 --> 38:48.120]  In the same way that if you aren't not just in line and accepting of their narrative and their ideology and their agenda,
[38:48.120 --> 38:51.120]  you have to actually actively participate in it.
[38:51.120 --> 38:53.120]  And if you don't, then you're an enemy.
[38:53.120 --> 38:58.120]  Then you're hurting them somehow. How dare you be on the side of the enemy.
[38:58.120 --> 39:01.120]  If you're not with us, you're with the terrorists.
[39:01.120 --> 39:06.120]  We've been through this all before, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, the Iraq war.
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.120]  I mean, we've seen all of this. I thought we would have woken up at this point.
[39:09.120 --> 39:14.120]  And it's nice, isn't it, being on the right side of history, knowing that when those conflicts were going down,
[39:14.120 --> 39:19.120]  we here at Info Wars, Alex Jones and those who listened to him, such as myself at the time,
[39:19.120 --> 39:27.120]  weren't taken in by the claims of patriotism, by the people that got us into those endless war conflicts.
[39:27.120 --> 39:32.120]  Isn't it nice to know that we were right about that and that we're right about this as well?
[39:32.120 --> 39:45.120]  As again, we warn against the foreign intervention and manipulation of other countries by our elites for their own benefit.
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.120]  But hey, what the American people want, they're not really reflected in what the politicians do.
[39:51.120 --> 39:58.120]  In fact, took them months and months to send you a $600 check of your own money during the COVID pandemic.
[39:58.120 --> 40:06.120]  They were incapable of scraping together a couple million dollars to build the wall at the southern border or boost our border defenses.
[40:06.120 --> 40:10.120]  They just can't do it. They're trying. They can't come to a compromise.
[40:10.120 --> 40:18.120]  The negotiations are stalling. It's all bureaucratic mumbo jumbo that sounds like it's...
[40:18.120 --> 40:22.120]  They're really trying so hard to do these things. They just can't.
[40:22.120 --> 40:28.120]  But then when it comes to war, suddenly it's super easy. Suddenly it's five minutes in and out.
[40:28.120 --> 40:34.120]  $800 million done. Blank check. Write it. Sign the American people's name to it and send it off to whoever.
[40:34.120 --> 40:39.120]  Who cares, right? Nazis, Islamic terrorists. It doesn't matter. It's war.
[40:39.120 --> 40:50.120]  It goes into the pockets of our warmongers of those great American corporations making weapons for all occasions.
[40:50.120 --> 40:58.120]  So write the blank check. No problem. Easy as pie when it comes to spending your money on waging war overseas.
[40:58.120 --> 41:07.120]  Let's go now to clip number three here. This is Joe Biden announcing an additional $800 million in security aid to Ukraine.
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.120]  And it's clearly helped Ukraine inflict dramatic losses on Russian forces.
[41:12.120 --> 41:21.120]  On Saturday, my administration authorized another $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons and ammunition moving to Ukraine.
[41:21.120 --> 41:32.120]  Now I'm once again using my presidential authority to activate an additional security assistance to continue to help Ukraine fend off Russia's assault.
[41:32.120 --> 41:42.120]  An additional $800 million in assistance. That brings the total of new U.S. security assistance to Ukraine to $1 billion just this week.
[41:42.120 --> 41:51.120]  My God. It's just unimaginable that some money just signed away the flick of a wrist. Your money, by the way. Did I mention that?
[41:51.120 --> 41:54.120]  It's your money. It's not theirs. They don't have any money. No, it's all your money.
[41:54.120 --> 42:04.120]  It's your pockets they're going into to fund endless warfare overseas as they continue to do without break, it seems.
[42:04.120 --> 42:13.120]  All I know is I'm very proud to be a part of an organization that has always stalwartly and intelligently stood against the war mongering of this country
[42:13.120 --> 42:18.120]  and will continue to do it and will continue to probably be right about this sort of stuff.
[42:18.120 --> 42:27.120]  And I hope that you can support us by going to InfowarsStore.com. I'll tell you. I'm all in. I mean, I'm, I was the American Journal in the mornings.
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.120]  I hope you tune into that too. But, you know, there's no, there's no, I'm not going to join Fox News, right?
[42:33.120 --> 42:40.120]  There's no other option for me. Just like there's no other option for Alex Jones or Owen Shroy or anybody else that works in Infowars.
[42:40.120 --> 42:52.120]  So we'll go down with this ship or we'll stay afloat and we'll take on the armadas of the globalist and we'll have victory after victory as long as we have you at our backs supporting us and carrying us through these trying times.
[42:52.120 --> 43:10.120]  Please go to InfowarsStore.com. Support us. Get stuff you need. It's a 360 win.
[43:22.120 --> 43:37.120]  We're going to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria,
[43:37.120 --> 43:49.120]  their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[43:49.120 --> 43:57.120]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence. And that's why it's hard to share Infowars links and band up video links.
[43:57.120 --> 44:02.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[44:02.120 --> 44:12.120]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[44:12.120 --> 44:19.120]  They know you're angry. And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.
[44:19.120 --> 44:26.120]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, if you sign up for our free news and show alerts, you can then take those alerts, those articles and those live feeds,
[44:26.120 --> 44:30.120]  both the regular shows and special reports, and share them with everyone you know.
[44:30.120 --> 44:42.120]  Take action now by texting the word NEWS to 833-470-0438. That's 833-470-0438 for Infowars emergency news alerts.
[44:42.120 --> 44:49.120]  Or text the word SHOW to 833-470-0438 and receive live show notifications.
[44:49.120 --> 44:54.120]  Take action now. Create the chain reaction until others share those texts.
[44:54.120 --> 45:00.120]  That's 833-470-0438 for Infowars emergency news alerts.
[45:24.120 --> 45:33.120]  Boy, is it true. The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[45:33.120 --> 45:42.120]  They knew all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong.
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.120]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[45:46.120 --> 45:50.120]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars in the air now more than ever.
[45:50.120 --> 45:55.120]  Even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe handling.
[45:55.120 --> 46:21.120]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[46:21.120 --> 46:29.120]  That's 833-470-0438 for Infowars emergency news alerts.
[46:51.120 --> 47:01.120]  Enjoy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it is completely sold out at InfowarsStore.com.
[47:01.120 --> 47:10.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.120]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[47:12.120 --> 47:16.120]  Incno Radders declare DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft.
[47:16.120 --> 47:19.120]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[47:19.120 --> 47:23.120]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[47:23.120 --> 47:25.120]  Target selection complete.
[47:25.120 --> 47:27.120]  Time on target sequence complete.
[47:27.120 --> 47:35.120]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.120]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[47:39.120 --> 47:43.120]  From the front lines of the information war.
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.120]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.120]  We are at DEF CON 1.
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.120]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[47:52.120 --> 47:53.120]  You bet!
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[47:57.120 --> 48:01.120]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.120]  Three, two, one, impact.
[48:06.120 --> 48:08.120]  Shall we play a game?
[48:08.120 --> 48:14.120]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[48:14.120 --> 48:19.120]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[48:19.120 --> 48:23.120]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.120]  We are in launch mode.
[48:25.120 --> 48:29.120]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[48:29.120 --> 48:33.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[48:33.120 --> 48:34.120]  We're in.
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.120]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[48:36.120 --> 48:39.120]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[48:39.120 --> 48:41.120]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[48:41.120 --> 48:45.120]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[48:45.120 --> 48:52.120]  The only winning goal is not to play.
[48:52.120 --> 48:56.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are playing the game right now.
[48:56.120 --> 49:00.120]  We are caught in the jaws of what can easily become the end of civilization,
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.120]  perhaps all life on Earth, as we know it.
[49:04.120 --> 49:07.120]  Alex Jones here, back in the cockpit today.
[49:07.120 --> 49:11.120]  I think the great host of American Journal, Harrison Smith, are sitting in
[49:11.120 --> 49:15.120]  while I was here in the office working on some things that had to be dealt with
[49:15.120 --> 49:18.120]  that were so important and so serious that I could not be on air
[49:18.120 --> 49:23.120]  when the first hour was in the office just next door.
[49:23.120 --> 49:26.120]  Let's just talk cold turkey here.
[49:26.120 --> 49:31.120]  There is a worldwide financial collapse already initiated.
[49:31.120 --> 49:35.120]  The global casual society is prepped and ready and already rolling out,
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.120]  and the controllers want to start big wars and economic crises
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.120]  that they can blame on what's about to happen
[49:43.120 --> 49:45.120]  so they can pose as the savior brain in the new system,
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.120]  the world casual society, social credit score, carbon tax.
[49:51.120 --> 49:53.120]  Emergency Thursday broadcast.
[49:53.120 --> 49:58.120]  Pope warns nuclear war imminent.
[49:58.120 --> 50:01.120]  Again, Emergency Thursday broadcast.
[50:01.120 --> 50:05.120]  Pope warns nuclear war imminent, potential end of the world at hand
[50:05.120 --> 50:09.120]  as Hollywood global corporate press demand massive escalation
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.120]  of Western involvement in Ukraine.
[50:13.120 --> 50:15.120]  We're going to go over it all today.
[50:15.120 --> 50:17.120]  We have some big guests as well.
[50:17.120 --> 50:20.120]  I was out in California for three days,
[50:20.120 --> 50:24.120]  and it was the most over-the-top trip I've ever been on.
[50:24.120 --> 50:27.120]  Before that, it was California, the Bohemian Grove,
[50:27.120 --> 50:31.120]  that I infiltrated and got the footage up with Mike Hansen 22 years ago.
[50:31.120 --> 50:34.120]  That was the strangest thing I ever did.
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.120]  This trip topped it all,
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.120]  and a lot of it I'm not at liberty to get into or talk about.
[50:39.120 --> 50:41.120]  Very interesting.
[50:41.120 --> 50:46.120]  And then the rest of it, we will break very, very soon.
[50:46.120 --> 50:48.120]  In fact, I might even just start breaking it today
[50:48.120 --> 50:50.120]  because it's going to be breaking at any time.
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.120]  A lot of big stuff, a lot of big stuff happened.
[50:52.120 --> 50:54.120]  It was wild.
[50:54.120 --> 51:00.120]  And definitely Hotel California.
[51:00.120 --> 51:04.120]  So that's going to be coming up.
[51:04.120 --> 51:07.120]  I mean, I wish I could tell you all this stuff, folks.
[51:07.120 --> 51:09.120]  I wish I could tell you everything, but I can't.
[51:09.120 --> 51:14.120]  So just let me assure you that what we're talking about on this broadcast
[51:14.120 --> 51:17.120]  is the zeitgeist, and everybody's watching,
[51:17.120 --> 51:21.120]  and the left of the media can attack us and try to shut us down,
[51:21.120 --> 51:24.120]  and they have no idea that we, not just this broadcast,
[51:24.120 --> 51:28.120]  but all of you have transcended their new world order
[51:28.120 --> 51:31.120]  and that their whole system is already defeated.
[51:31.120 --> 51:37.120]  The question is, can they take us with them into the abyss?
[51:37.120 --> 51:40.120]  And that's really the big question.
[51:40.120 --> 51:43.120]  Separately, we can't just give up on life and roll over
[51:43.120 --> 51:45.120]  because of all the censorship, the attacks,
[51:45.120 --> 51:49.120]  the threats of nuclear war, the proxy wars, all the rest of it.
[51:49.120 --> 51:52.120]  Those of us that love God and love justice and love freedom have to know
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.120]  they want us to give up with the COVID lockdowns
[51:54.120 --> 51:56.120]  and give up being told we're not essential
[51:56.120 --> 52:01.120]  and give up on our children and our husbands and our wives and everybody else
[52:01.120 --> 52:04.120]  and basically go along with the system and just roll over
[52:04.120 --> 52:07.120]  and then let it give us the universal basic income
[52:07.120 --> 52:10.120]  produced and delivered by robots.
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.120]  That's where this is all going.
[52:12.120 --> 52:15.120]  That will be nothing but a living hell and death.
[52:15.120 --> 52:18.120]  Everything we do must be becoming more human again,
[52:18.120 --> 52:20.120]  getting closer to nature again,
[52:20.120 --> 52:24.120]  but while simultaneously understanding and conquering technology
[52:24.120 --> 52:28.120]  as a shield and a sword against those using technology against us.
[52:28.120 --> 52:31.120]  So it's a double-edged operation in my view.
[52:31.120 --> 52:36.120]  And separately, I can tell you that it's a bittersweet thing
[52:36.120 --> 52:39.120]  with all these Democratic Party-funded lawsuits against us
[52:39.120 --> 52:41.120]  and the de-platforming and the attacks and the blackballing
[52:41.120 --> 52:43.120]  and the debanking and all of it,
[52:43.120 --> 52:48.120]  that the people involved mid-level and low-level
[52:48.120 --> 52:52.120]  think they're going to get money, which doesn't exist in any large amounts,
[52:52.120 --> 52:56.120]  and the people on top think they're going to destroy and shut down info wars,
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.120]  and that's not going to happen either.
[52:58.120 --> 53:01.120]  But in the timetables of the things that are going on,
[53:01.120 --> 53:05.120]  we need to be focused on being on air and doing interviews
[53:05.120 --> 53:09.120]  and sitting for important interviews
[53:09.120 --> 53:12.120]  to change world opinion and not be distracted by the globalists.
[53:12.120 --> 53:16.120]  And so, to just keep this place operating with our own bandwidth,
[53:16.120 --> 53:18.120]  our own infrastructure, our own satellite uplinks,
[53:18.120 --> 53:21.120]  our own crew, our own everything, our own software had to be built.
[53:21.120 --> 53:23.120]  Everything was taken away.
[53:23.120 --> 53:27.120]  We had to build infrastructure for tens of millions of dollars
[53:27.120 --> 53:31.120]  and then millions up, dated and upkeep it every quarter
[53:31.120 --> 53:34.120]  just to be able to go out and do what you see here
[53:34.120 --> 53:36.120]  across the country and across the world.
[53:36.120 --> 53:39.120]  So thank you for keeping us on air, but I got to tell you,
[53:39.120 --> 53:45.120]  I'm sitting there looking at the tank on info wars, almost empty,
[53:45.120 --> 53:47.120]  and then I've got a little reserve tank,
[53:47.120 --> 53:50.120]  and that's been taken down by one third.
[53:50.120 --> 53:54.120]  And so, if you ever were going to buy a product at infowarstore.com,
[53:54.120 --> 53:57.120]  if you ever were going to go to infowarstore.com where it says support
[53:57.120 --> 54:00.120]  and click on that and be a sponsor, make a donation,
[54:00.120 --> 54:04.120]  we'll put a link to the donation page and a live show feed under the video feed.
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  If you were ever going to step up,
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.120]  because a lot of you have already stepped up many times and I appreciate you,
[54:08.120 --> 54:11.120]  I'm talking to folks that have never bought a product,
[54:11.120 --> 54:13.120]  never given a donation, never spread a video,
[54:13.120 --> 54:16.120]  never supported the show, you're supporting yourself here.
[54:16.120 --> 54:20.120]  And this operation is critical to the future and where we're going,
[54:20.120 --> 54:22.120]  and I appreciate you all for your support,
[54:22.120 --> 54:26.120]  but I'm asking those that have never gotten a t-shirt
[54:26.120 --> 54:29.120]  or never gotten a book or a film or a shortwave radio
[54:29.120 --> 54:33.120]  or any of the products at infowarstore.com,
[54:33.120 --> 54:36.120]  I'm asking you now to go there and buy the products
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.120]  because we haven't raised prices on products
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.120]  and we haven't done a lot of things and I'm realizing
[54:40.120 --> 54:44.120]  our prices have gone up because of the inflation and because of the problems.
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.120]  So we're in a paradox where we bring in a lot of money,
[54:47.120 --> 54:51.120]  but most of it is the cost of the products.
[54:51.120 --> 54:55.120]  We brought on a few sponsors that are great and they've got good product,
[54:55.120 --> 54:58.120]  but it's not up yet to the level to deal with our shortfalls,
[54:58.120 --> 55:00.120]  though it looks like in the next few months, it will be.
[55:00.120 --> 55:02.120]  So again, we're nipping tuck here.
[55:02.120 --> 55:05.120]  The real reason you should get our products is they're amazing, regardless,
[55:05.120 --> 55:08.120]  and we have vaso beats that's so good for your cardiovascular system
[55:08.120 --> 55:10.120]  and your heart and that's so important these days.
[55:10.120 --> 55:14.120]  It's back in stock 40% off and we have the fizzy magnesium,
[55:14.120 --> 55:16.120]  double magnesium, so good for your body,
[55:16.120 --> 55:19.120]  so good for post-workout and going to sleep at night.
[55:19.120 --> 55:21.120]  It doesn't make you sleep, but it really makes your sleep better.
[55:21.120 --> 55:23.120]  Just so much for your body.
[55:23.120 --> 55:24.120]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[55:24.120 --> 55:25.120]  It's 25% off.
[55:25.120 --> 55:27.120]  We also have the amazing vitamin D3,
[55:27.120 --> 55:29.120]  highest quality vitamin D3,
[55:29.120 --> 55:34.120]  gummies that taste great, children love them, adults love them.
[55:34.120 --> 55:36.120]  Everybody should get theirs, 25% off,
[55:36.120 --> 55:43.120]  infowarstore.com and Biotrystallinium sold out for like a year, I think.
[55:43.120 --> 55:45.120]  Highest quality from the mustard seed,
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.120]  vital in all electrochemical activity.
[55:48.120 --> 55:52.120]  It goes like a horse and carriage with iodine.
[55:52.120 --> 55:54.120]  And so if you have either one of those
[55:54.120 --> 55:56.120]  or both of those efficiencies, you're screwed.
[55:56.120 --> 55:58.120]  So it's just as important as iodine.
[55:58.120 --> 56:02.120]  It's back in stock 1795.
[56:02.120 --> 56:04.120]  It's 40% off.
[56:04.120 --> 56:07.120]  You will not find any deal anywhere close to Biotrystallinium
[56:07.120 --> 56:09.120]  because they've got the synthetic cellinium
[56:09.120 --> 56:10.120]  that's not even good for you.
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.120]  This is pure organic from the mustard seed, pure cellinium.
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.120]  But I would tell you, take the allowance of it.
[56:16.120 --> 56:17.120]  Don't take extra.
[56:17.120 --> 56:18.120]  It's powerful.
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.120]  It'll do amazing things for your body,
[56:20.120 --> 56:23.120]  but it'll boost testosterone.
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.120]  So men, if you take it, you might get ready to say bye-bye to your hair
[56:26.120 --> 56:28.120]  if you take more than you're supposed to.
[56:28.120 --> 56:29.120]  So it's that powerful.
[56:29.120 --> 56:33.120]  Cellinium is powerful. It's 40% off.
[56:33.120 --> 56:38.120]  Infoworkstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[56:38.120 --> 56:39.120]  And it really comes down to that.
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.120]  And you guys have done such a great job.
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.120]  And I'm so thankful for your word of mouth, your prayers,
[56:43.120 --> 56:44.120]  your financial support.
[56:44.120 --> 56:49.120]  But I'm literally running around not able to even do the show
[56:49.120 --> 56:52.120]  because I've got to go make sure this is transferred
[56:52.120 --> 56:55.120]  and that's done and haul the sponsor and get that money.
[56:55.120 --> 56:57.120]  And I mean, do you want me spending half my time
[56:57.120 --> 56:59.120]  keeping the gas in the tank
[56:59.120 --> 57:01.120]  or do you want me driving the race car?
[57:01.120 --> 57:03.120]  If you'll just keep that tank closer to full,
[57:03.120 --> 57:05.120]  I don't have to make these pit stops
[57:05.120 --> 57:07.120]  and basically blow an engine.
[57:07.120 --> 57:09.120]  It's the best way to describe it.
[57:09.120 --> 57:10.120]  You just pray for it.
[57:10.120 --> 57:11.120]  You spread the word.
[57:11.120 --> 57:13.120]  And you just buy the products at infoworkstore.com.
[57:13.120 --> 57:15.120]  And baby, we're going to win this race.
[57:15.120 --> 57:17.120]  We're in the pole position with there's smoke coming out
[57:17.120 --> 57:19.120]  and the gas tank's going down
[57:19.120 --> 57:21.120]  and you can magically fill that tank
[57:21.120 --> 57:23.120]  and I don't have to pull over.
[57:23.120 --> 57:25.120]  Because that's what getting the sponsorship is,
[57:25.120 --> 57:28.120]  and it takes a lot of time and I would do that normally.
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  And they're not going to shut jack crap down, by the way.
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  We've got the whole sponsorship model and so much more.
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  It's just that the fight is so intense
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.120]  I don't need to be at the ammo factory to use a war analogy
[57:38.120 --> 57:41.120]  loading up the ammunition for the peaceful revolution of information
[57:41.120 --> 57:43.120]  to fire the truth bombs
[57:43.120 --> 57:45.120]  and then fighting the combat on the front lines.
[57:45.120 --> 57:47.120]  I need the fuel now.

[58:54.120 --> 58:56.120]  that even though you don't have anything to hide
[58:56.120 --> 59:00.120]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[59:00.120 --> 59:06.120]  are stealing all of your data and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.

[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:25.120]  Let's just sit back and listen to some of this music.
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:28.120]  Some real poetry if you know the German.
[1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:40.120]  Thank you.
[1:00:40.120 --> 1:01:08.120]  Thank you.
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:18.120]  Emergency Thursday broadcast. Hope warrants nuclear war imminent potential in the world at hand.
[1:01:18.120 --> 1:01:30.120]  As Hollywood and global corporate press demand massive escalation of western involvement in Ukraine.
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  All right. Here we are.
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:39.120]  The COVID news is completely off the chart.
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:43.120]  But then the war world three information is so big.
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  And then you've got Biden completely disintegrating on air.
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:50.120]  I mean, he was a joke three years ago as a candidate.
[1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:55.120]  He was a joke, you know, 14 months ago was stealing the election.
[1:01:55.120 --> 1:02:02.120]  He's up there talking about every man or everybody knows somebody that's been caught nude photos with children.
[1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:10.120]  I mean, anybody knows about somebody that has dementia.
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:14.120]  Any of their dark secrets or weirdness is going to come to the surface.
[1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  And how the establishment can continue to stick him in front of cameras.
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:25.120]  Not knowing what's about to come out.
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.120]  I mean, if you thought corn pop and the blonde hair standing up and the black kids are like roaches.
[1:02:30.120 --> 1:02:32.120]  He said that not mean it.
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  If you sit there and think that's crazy.
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:38.120]  Well, you don't know people with dementia.
[1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:45.120]  So he's somebody with dementia that they give methamphetamine to his pupils are just jacked out.
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  And he didn't know what planet he's on.
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:50.120]  And let me tell you what's screwing up society and civilization.
[1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  It really is drugs at the end of the day.
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:57.120]  I was out in California for one of the biggest podcast out there.
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  And I was hanging around with a very interesting famous person.
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:04.120]  And because I'm literally like an anthropologist.
[1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:08.120]  People ask, I got asked in my custody battle hearings, you know, five years ago.
[1:03:08.120 --> 1:03:10.120]  How often you smoke marijuana?
[1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:12.120]  We hear you're a big drug addict.
[1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  I say about once a year, like a cultural thing, like a peace pipe.
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:16.120]  But it's so strong.
[1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:17.120]  I don't like it.
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:20.120]  Soros is funded, you know, in other groups making it weaponized.
[1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:21.120]  And they laughed at that.
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:24.120]  They're not laughing now.
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:25.120]  People aren't laughing now.
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:26.120]  They know how strong it is.
[1:03:26.120 --> 1:03:31.120]  I smoked some pot when I was out in California where it's legal.
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:34.120]  And I still feel it two days later.
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:44.120]  Smoked it one time at one sitting with somebody who's initial start with an M
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:48.120]  and end with a, the point is it's going to be huge when it comes out.
[1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:50.120]  But I mean, I did it when in Rome as the Romans.
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:57.120]  And I'm literally feel like marijuana felt in 1990 when I'd occasionally smoke it.
[1:03:57.120 --> 1:03:59.120]  You know, you take some cheerleader out on a date.
[1:03:59.120 --> 1:04:01.120]  She goes, let's smoke a joint before you go to the movie.
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:02.120]  You're like, I guess so.
[1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:04.120]  If you hit, it's kind of feel like this.
[1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:10.120]  This is what marijuana in 1990 felt like two days later after I smoked it.
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:14.120]  I feel like I just took hits of 1990 marijuana right now.
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:17.120]  But that's because I never take marijuana.
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:18.120]  So it hits me stronger.
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:21.120]  But the people that are on this stuff, you go to LA.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:28.120]  There is just plentiful weaponized marijuana, plentiful weaponized everything else everywhere and fentanyl.
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:33.120]  And this is the chemical bio attack to take down America and turn us into zombies.
[1:04:33.120 --> 1:04:35.120]  And I'm not judging the people.
[1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:37.120]  You know, you got to go in and be in amongst it all.
[1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:42.120]  You know, you got to bond with them so I could then have a national discussion about this.
[1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:46.120]  But if I smoked pot like that every day, I'd be like these people.
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:52.120]  Hell, I feel like I'm ready to lie down on the side of the road and go to sleep a couple of months right now.
[1:04:52.120 --> 1:04:53.120]  I'm serious, folks.
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:05:19.120]  Five hits off California weed and I can barely get up.
[1:05:19.120 --> 1:05:25.120]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:05:25.120 --> 1:05:34.120]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:37.120]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:05:37.120 --> 1:05:42.120]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:51.120]  In Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:53.120]  So pray for these folks big time.
[1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:55.120]  It's a very serious situation.
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:06:00.120]  And stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:27.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation is Alex Jones.
[1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:33.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:36.120]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:42.120]  We have some very big guests joining us coming up today, including in the next segment.
[1:06:42.120 --> 1:06:45.120]  But we'll introduce that guest when he joins us.
[1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:50.120]  Let me just read you a couple of these headlines here for you today.
[1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:57.120]  Francis warns final catastrophe close quote quote could extinguish human race.
[1:06:57.120 --> 1:07:04.120]  I really should do the whole show on that because he's absolutely telling the truth.
[1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:09.120]  Meanwhile, White House not interested in World War three.
[1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:17.120]  But all their surrogate sure are Ukraine President Zelensky calls on Biden to be the leader of peace by igniting World War three.
[1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:20.120]  And they ask Congress for more heavy weapons.
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:25.120]  And guess what Biden does 800 million mainly in attack drones.
[1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:26.120]  They call them drones.
[1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:41.120]  They're cheap inexpensive missiles that can loiter and then accelerate to 300 miles an hour and destroy large groups of people or machines.
[1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:44.120]  We've got a report on that coming up.
[1:07:44.120 --> 1:07:48.120]  He shipped in a bunch of the switchblade drone.
[1:07:48.120 --> 1:07:53.120]  Is there a peace deal Putin and Zelensky can accept?
[1:07:53.120 --> 1:08:02.120]  And I agree with Rand Paul when he said Putin miscalculated.
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.120]  Yeah, why do you miscalculate?
[1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:12.120]  Why did his Foreign Service FSB had their CIA had?
[1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:15.120]  Why did they tell them that everybody was going to surrender?
[1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:20.120]  Because let me tell you, if I knew that there were stay-behind networks there,
[1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:25.120]  and those stay-behind networks hadn't been compromised or paid off, the Russians would be in big trouble.
[1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:30.120]  If I knew that, and I did, I told you the CIA's been over there training them in 2014,
[1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:33.120]  and I know folks that have been over there, but it's not even a secret.
[1:08:33.120 --> 1:08:38.120]  Then you know Putin knew that or you knew that the FSB knew.
[1:08:38.120 --> 1:08:42.120]  So, I mean, maybe Putin didn't know.
[1:08:42.120 --> 1:08:47.120]  He sure as hell has arrested the head of the FSB Foreign Intelligence Service and his deputies and a bunch of others.
[1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:49.120]  How dangerous is that?
[1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:52.120]  And then this breaks yesterday, y'all know this.
[1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:57.120]  Exclusive secret CIA training program in Ukraine helped Kiev prepare for Russian invasion.
[1:08:57.120 --> 1:09:08.120]  Yeah, but it didn't start in 2015. It started in 1945.
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:14.120]  And the first war after World War II was not Korea.
[1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:17.120]  It was 1945 in Ukraine.
[1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:20.120]  That's actually in the mainline military history books.
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:31.120]  But, you know, the Cold War started, and Iron Curtain has descended down, as Churchill said, over Eastern Europe.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:36.120]  And so, stay-behind networks that the Nazis had, the U.S. came in.
[1:09:36.120 --> 1:09:45.120]  That's why they recruited Adolf Ackman and Klaus Barbie and Joseph Mengele and all the rest of them,
[1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:52.120]  so they could control those networks and try to hold off the Soviets' political coups and overthrows in Eastern Europe.
[1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:55.120]  And in some areas, they were successful and most they weren't.
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:58.120]  But no stay-behind networks never went away.
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:01.120]  And so, the United States simply reactivated them.
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:06.120]  And isn't it funny? You could put seeds, almost any plant seed, in a drawer for hundreds of years,
[1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.120]  and they'll still be good when you plant them.
[1:10:08.120 --> 1:10:14.120]  They've dug up papyrus seeds in 3,000-year-old Egyptian tombs that sprout perfectly later.
[1:10:14.120 --> 1:10:21.120]  So you wonder why, when they put the miracle grow of an overthrow in a civil war on Ukraine,
[1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.120]  when Soros did that, that came up out of the dirt to Soros.
[1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:33.120]  Beautiful comrades he fought with against the Russians in World War II.
[1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:39.120]  Beautiful comrades came popping back up because they were just laying there dormant for 75 years under the soil,
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:42.120]  their children and grandchildren.
[1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:44.120]  But still, I don't support Putin and what he's done.
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:47.120]  I just know all the facts about it, or a lot of the facts, so I'm the bad man.
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:51.120]  Because, you know, you don't want the public actually knowing the pieces to make their own decision.
[1:10:51.120 --> 1:10:53.120]  And my decision is, let's end this war real quick.
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:56.120]  The West helped start it with stay-behind networks.
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:57.120]  Putin took the bait and came in.
[1:10:57.120 --> 1:11:01.120]  It endangers the world. Both sides have arguments. Let's end this now.
[1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:05.120]  Like the Pope said, we need peace. We need a deal. We need to stop this right now.
[1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:10.120]  And I'm not usually dealing, agreeing with the Pope, or even Biden saying we could have World War III.
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:12.120]  Because it needs to stop.
[1:11:12.120 --> 1:11:17.120]  And instead of being on Ukraine's side, like all the left of the media's, calling for World War II,
[1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.120]  or instead of being on the Russian side saying Putin's perfect and he deserves it all,
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:26.120]  and he's right and let's get behind him and crush, you know, Putin's to start leveling cities.
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:32.120]  He'll show them what to do. No, let's not do any of that.
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:35.120]  If you had to blame somebody, it's Soros on the left and the globalists.
[1:11:35.120 --> 1:11:38.120]  I mean, if you have to pick who started this and who drew first blood,
[1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:42.120]  and who got this all going, and who poked the bear over and over again,
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:44.120]  so it would come down the path and step in the bear trap.
[1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:46.120]  Yeah, it's the globalists. It's the New World Order.
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:49.120]  It's Barack Obama. It's George Soros. Yes.
[1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:56.120]  And they want to suck us into a global crisis that's the pretext for a global social credit score
[1:11:56.120 --> 1:12:02.120]  and a casual society they now admit that is the cover for what two years of COVID tyranny did destroying the economy.
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:04.120]  So the war is bad for the people.
[1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:09.120]  The war is bad for humans and prosperity and our basic liberties.
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  And so knowledge is the answer.
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:15.120]  The people know what's happening. They will live in liberty.
[1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:17.120]  If they don't know, they will live in tyranny.
[1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:20.120]  And so the answer is seeing the whole thing from a globalist perspective,
[1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:23.120]  but being against their agenda, understanding what they're doing,
[1:12:23.120 --> 1:12:26.120]  but then saying, I'm not going to be part of this.
[1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:30.120]  I'm going to find a solution out of this so we don't kill each other
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:37.120]  and stop with this war model that we can't engage in now because of nuclear weapons and other things.
[1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.120]  Of course, the biolabs are real. Of course, all this is insane.
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:44.120]  The people running our country hate us.
[1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:48.120]  They hate us more than the Russians.
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:53.120]  One thing about being in LA for three days, man, I get sick every time I'm there.
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:13:00.120]  I would just say allergies like to the toxic dust. Every time I go there, I get a huge headache
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:04.120]  and just feel like hell. I don't know why I'm going off on a tangent here, but man,
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:09.120]  beautiful place, a lot of amazing stuff, but man, you don't want to build a big giant city
[1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:16.120]  of 10 million people between an ocean and a mountain range that captures all of the particular,
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:21.120]  all there in one spot. But don't worry, toxic cities is the least of our problems
[1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:26.120]  with nuclear fallout, obviously, on its way if we don't turn around very, very, very quickly.
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.120]  Let me get into some more of the headlines here.
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:32.120]  Oh, how loving. I mentioned this earlier.
[1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:37.120]  U.S. sending suicide drones to Ukraine.
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:42.120]  What they are is drones that are missile platforms that a one person can carry,
[1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:46.120]  four or five of them, but the average person carries two in a backpack.
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:52.120]  They're about two feet long and they can go out up to five miles and they target the grid.
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:56.120]  Somebody tells you where the enemy is, you fly out to it, you see where your target,
[1:13:56.120 --> 1:14:00.120]  that's someone's targeting usually, and then you fly into it.
[1:14:00.120 --> 1:14:08.120]  And China's answer is they're sitting in because the Russians are already fighting these.
[1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:12.120]  You know, but by the time you hear about it, they were already fighting it.
[1:14:12.120 --> 1:14:16.120]  The Russians don't have as many drones as the Chinese, so where does the Chinese
[1:14:16.120 --> 1:14:23.120]  have been flying into Russia? Tens of thousands of their drones that they were planning to use,
[1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:28.120]  these are little drones, for the attack on Taiwan if needed.
[1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:31.120]  And again, they hover around, they watch, they land on top of a building,
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:36.120]  they get solar power, they charge back up, they come and attack.
[1:14:36.120 --> 1:14:43.120]  There's a lot of different types of them. Some of them got rocket assist to take off, but they didn't use solar.
[1:14:43.120 --> 1:14:46.120]  And it's a big problem.
[1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:49.120]  And so the robot war is here.
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:52.120]  I remember ten years ago telling you there's going to be drone wars and all this,
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.120]  oh, you're crazy, and now it's just happening.
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:15:01.120]  And overnight we're now sucked in to oblivion.
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:03.120]  Enemy of the people.
[1:15:03.120 --> 1:15:06.120]  News media begged for war during White House press briefing.
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:10.120]  We've got this slobbering event as a bunch of women called for war.
[1:15:10.120 --> 1:15:14.120]  I thought women were anti-war.
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:17.120]  Putin claims U.S.'s network of controversial bioweapons labs is Ukraine.
[1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:19.120]  I love how we're like back to square one.
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:22.120]  They're there, it's on record they're there, the U.S. government admits they're there.
[1:15:22.120 --> 1:15:26.120]  They took over the Soviet labs and expanded them, but because the media then denies it,
[1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:31.120]  while the undersecretary of state, Victoria Newland, simultaneously admits it,
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:34.120]  we get caught up in a debate about whether it exists or not,
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:37.120]  as if we can't go out and find the fact that it does.
[1:15:37.120 --> 1:15:39.120]  That's called gaslighting.
[1:15:39.120 --> 1:15:43.120]  All right, we have the man that wrote the U.S. Biological Chemical Weapons Law,
[1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:47.120]  former top U.N. prosecutor of Salmabalajevic, and others on the straight away,
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:50.120]  to break down what's really happening with the biolabs and more.
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:53.120]  Dr. Francis Boyle, straight ahead, infowars.com.
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:16:02.120]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:32.120]  This legislation's being introduced, that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information,
[1:16:32.120 --> 1:16:36.120]  you can be censored, you can be arrested, you can be imprisoned.
[1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:42.120]  And of course now, Canada's under this legislation, that if you have a thought crime,
[1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:47.120]  and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online,
[1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:49.120]  that you will be censored and arrested.
[1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:54.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world,
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:59.120]  against humanity, that makes infowars.com more important than ever.
[1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.120]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:17:02.120 --> 1:17:05.120]  I've been training, probably not as much as they should be,
[1:17:05.120 --> 1:17:10.120]  but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:17:10.120 --> 1:17:16.120]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going.
[1:17:16.120 --> 1:17:21.120]  Besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C,
[1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:26.120]  to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[1:17:26.120 --> 1:17:29.120]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:33.120]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list.
[1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:35.120]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[1:17:35.120 --> 1:17:39.120]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now,
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:42.120]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:46.120]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:50.120]  Even if you are not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news,
[1:17:50.120 --> 1:17:54.120]  turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day,
[1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:58.120]  and sore list can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:03.120]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones
[1:18:03.120 --> 1:18:05.120]  to leading a healthier life.
[1:18:05.120 --> 1:18:09.120]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:11.120]  with a supplement that contains both.
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:15.120]  This infowars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:18.120]  should be your next purchase from the infowars store.
[1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:23.120]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[1:18:23.120 --> 1:18:25.120]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:30.120]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[1:18:30.120 --> 1:18:36.120]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:41.120]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:45.120]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:18:45.120 --> 1:18:48.120]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[1:18:48.120 --> 1:18:51.120]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:18:51.120 --> 1:18:55.120]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:58.120]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:01.120]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:05.120]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:08.120]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go,
[1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:11.120]  then coming to your house and threatening in some cases,
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:16.120]  actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:20.120]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process
[1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:24.120]  where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:19:24.120 --> 1:19:26.120]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:19:26.120 --> 1:19:30.120]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[1:19:30.120 --> 1:19:33.120]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant,
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:37.120]  meaning U.S. government military grade at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:43.120]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:43.120 --> 1:19:46.120]  Again, we have big backpacks, we have special dry bags,
[1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:50.120]  we've got them for cell phones, we've got them for laptops, we've got them for iPads.
[1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:53.120]  It's all there at infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:53.120 --> 1:20:07.120]  So protect your privacy today and support the Infowar at infowarsstore.com.
[1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:27.120]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:30.120]  We've got really one of the best experts we could have on about this.
[1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:35.120]  Dr. Francis Boyle went to Harvard and other universities and got the special degree,
[1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:38.120]  Ph.D., the only handout once a year, the same one Kissinger got,
[1:20:38.120 --> 1:20:40.120]  the same one Kissinger administered.
[1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:44.120]  So we got that top view of the Anglo-American globalist arm.
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:46.120]  And then, of course, he did many other things.
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:53.120]  He wrote the U.S. chemical and then later biological weapons laws,
[1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.120]  then was instrumental in the U.N. treaties as well.
[1:20:55.120 --> 1:21:02.120]  He was the lead U.N. also prosecutor in some of the biggest war crimes cases ever,
[1:21:02.120 --> 1:21:03.120]  including Sullivan-Milodrovic.
[1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:06.120]  His pedigrees know we don't need to go over it here
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:11.120]  because there's a lot to cover in the 45 minutes that we have here with him today.
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:17.120]  But to give a really real politic or 35,000-foot view of what the globalists are seeing
[1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:19.120]  or what's really happening there, I wanted to get him on.
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:22.120]  He's also an expert on biological weapons labs.
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:27.120]  I'm very frustrated in that I have hundreds of articles admitting that Obama and others
[1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:30.120]  went and basically refurbished these Soviet-era labs.
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:31.120]  It was in the Washington Post.
[1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:32.120]  It was everywhere. It's not debatable.
[1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.120]  And then Victoria Newland comes out last week, again,
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:38.120]  the deputy secretary of state and the Ukraine expert, as they call her,
[1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:41.120]  and admits that the labs are there.
[1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:43.120]  And then the media simultaneously says they don't exist.
[1:21:43.120 --> 1:21:44.120]  We made them up.
[1:21:44.120 --> 1:21:47.120]  And then you're a Russian agent, if you say they exist.
[1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:50.120]  And then, oh, but the Russians have seized two of them that don't exist,
[1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:54.120]  USA Today and CNN, saying they're going to attack us with them, but they don't exist.
[1:21:54.120 --> 1:22:00.120]  And so it just seems like we've entered a land of beyond the Tea Party in Alice in Wonderland.
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:04.120]  I mean, this seems to be not just propaganda,
[1:22:04.120 --> 1:22:08.120]  but a disconnected, incompetent state department in White House.
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.120]  I mean, you've got Biden not knowing who he is.
[1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:17.120]  You've got the vice president saying that Ukraine is NATO.
[1:22:17.120 --> 1:22:19.120]  We'll defend NATO.
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:25.120]  And then Biden saying that Iran has attacked Ukraine and that Russia has attacked Russia.
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:28.120]  I mean, this is really scary.
[1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:31.120]  Maybe it's not incompetence. Maybe it's something else.
[1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:35.120]  But this is wild. We have the CIA stay behind networks.
[1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:40.120]  The CIA now bragging in Yahoo News that they've been fighting the Russians since 2014,
[1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.120]  which we knew and told you from our sources.
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:44.120]  But now that's admitted.
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:50.120]  So it looks to me like Putin walked into a provocation and miscalculated and walked into a bear trap.
[1:22:50.120 --> 1:22:53.120]  I mean, I'm not lionizing Putin, but I know why he did it.
[1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:57.120]  So does Dr. Francis Boyle give us a 35,000 view?
[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:00.120]  We'll get into all the details like you love to do in the next segment.
[1:23:00.120 --> 1:23:08.120]  Just as an American, as a law professor, as a person that obviously doesn't want nuclear war,
[1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:11.120]  in six minutes to break, what is your synopsis?
[1:23:11.120 --> 1:23:16.120]  If you were briefing the world, you are briefing millions right now about the some knowledge
[1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:21.120]  of what you would call this sleepwalking into Armageddon or what is it?
[1:23:21.120 --> 1:23:23.120]  Well, Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.120]  I have my best year viewing your audience.
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:35.120]  Yes, it's as I see it, we really have to start with the promises made by Secretary of State Jim Baker
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:46.120]  and many of the other NATO leaders that if Secretary General Gorbachev agreed to the unification of Germany,
[1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:50.120]  NATO would not move to the east.
[1:23:50.120 --> 1:23:56.120]  But once Clinton got in there and they proceeded to expand NATO to the east,
[1:23:56.120 --> 1:24:06.120]  the promises that Baker and the other European leaders made to Gorbachev were binding under international law.
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:17.120]  High-level officials who give solemn assurances acting within their scope of authority can bind their states under international law.
[1:24:17.120 --> 1:24:20.120]  It's a basic principle of international law.
[1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:23.120]  Even the Russian lawyers know it.
[1:24:23.120 --> 1:24:27.120]  I've been over there lecturing to them and things of this nature.
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  So Ukraine was part of this project.
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:44.120]  And what we saw in 2014 was Obama-Biden launched a coup d'état against a democratically elected government in Ukraine,
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:50.120]  the Yanukovych government, and Newland, as you know, had a critical role to play.
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:25:02.120]  Those tapes were released bragging that the United States had put at least $5 billion into this clearly illegal coup d'état.
[1:25:02.120 --> 1:25:11.120]  And then we effectively established a neo-Nazi regime over there in Ukraine.
[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:26.120]  Right Sector, as of Brigades, many others whose dissent goes back directly to collaboration with Hitler and the Nazis when they occupied Ukraine.
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:38.120]  And then we proceeded to arm, equip, supply, train, finance, and direct these people until today.
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:41.120]  Biden's now arming them.
[1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:48.120]  To give you an example then, the front lines at Donbass were the Azov Brigade.
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:54.120]  These Nazis of the Azov Brigade were besieging Donetsk and Lugansk.
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:26:01.120]  They're only 460 kilometers from Stalingrad.
[1:26:01.120 --> 1:26:15.120]  And I have visited Stalingrad and I've toured Stalingrad and the genocidal bestiality of the Nazi army at Stalingrad literally took my breath away.
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:25.120]  Now, in December, as you know, the Russian government submitted two treaties to NATO and to the Biden administration.
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:30.120]  I've read them, I won't go through all of them here, there was a wish list, okay.
[1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:40.120]  The bottom line was, Russia wanted assurances that Ukraine was not going to join NATO.
[1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:50.120]  And that NATO would not expand, say, to Moldova and Georgia, which are right there in this area.
[1:26:50.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  And for two months, the Foreign Minister Laval fruitlessly negotiated with the Biden administration over this.
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:17.120]  And Biden refused, absolutely refused to make these assurances, which he should have given because they were required by the promises that Jim Baker had made for Bush Senior.
[1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  And I think even today, I'm in favor of stopping the war.
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:34.120]  It could be stopped today if President Biden were to get up and announce and say publicly, yes, Ukraine will not be joining NATO.
[1:27:34.120 --> 1:27:50.120]  And NATO will not be expanding to the east in Georgia, Moldova, or elsewhere. And the rest we're prepared to negotiate, certainly over removing U.S. nuclear weapons for Europe,
[1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  where they are there in five countries in violation of the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty.
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  And also, we will negotiate over so-called ABMs in Poland and Romania that definitely threaten Russia and can be immediately converted into offensive systems.
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:21.120]  And Dr. Boyle, let's talk about this. I mean, everybody understands that if Russia moved troops into Mexico onto the U.S. border, we'd go to war with them in a matter of weeks, not a matter of years.
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:34.120]  And so it is true that all these treaties expired. The U.S. did not want to negotiate and let them expire. And so Putin saw this again as, wow, they've cut all their Cold War era and post-Cold War nuclear agreements.
[1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:40.120]  They're going to war with us. I mean, for people that aren't a diplomat like you, a top diplomat, former diplomat, that's a major provocation.
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:44.120]  I want to get your take on that when we come back and talk about where this is all going.
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:54.120]  Wow, the U.S. and Europe have gotten on a war footing with Russia, put troops on their border, committed war crimes in Russian ethnic areas, and the Russians have doubled down and invaded, and now they're caught in trap.
[1:28:54.120 --> 1:29:15.120]  This is the stuff nuclear war is made of.
[1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:40.120]  They're suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:47.120]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:55.120]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence, and that's why it's hard to share in Cold War's links and band up with the Olympics.
[1:29:55.120 --> 1:29:59.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:09.120]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient-dense ingredients, VasoBeat will be your new favorite InfoWars life formula.
[1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:18.120]  Using only water and beetroot, VasoBeat is the most concentrated liquid extract of wheat on the market.
[1:30:18.120 --> 1:30:33.120]  With concentrated beet extract, you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates, and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels, and more.
[1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:46.120]  To overlook the power of beetroot, take your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K, and more.
[1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:57.120]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat from InfoWars life today.
[1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:06.120]  With the world awakening, I think it was important that we were right to prevent them right now, take advantage of this moment, and I have always an idea that something everybody can do, that every listener can do.
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:15.120]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang the banners over highways, imagine a giant bean or a piece of a layup made up that says Alex Jones is right, InfoWars.com.
[1:31:15.120 --> 1:31:18.120]  We stand with the truckers, we'll rest out or whatever.
[1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:20.120]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[1:31:20.120 --> 1:31:31.120]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall, or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways, and it will be a chain reaction.
[1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:33.120]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[1:31:33.120 --> 1:31:34.120]  I have a few ideas.
[1:31:34.120 --> 1:31:37.120]  First of all, health care is really important to our farm.
[1:31:37.120 --> 1:31:39.120]  Rest out, rest out, swap.
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:40.120]  Vaccine is poison.
[1:31:40.120 --> 1:31:41.120]  There's tons of things.
[1:31:41.120 --> 1:31:43.120]  I say just keep it short, keep it concise.
[1:31:43.120 --> 1:31:44.120]  Don't agree.
[1:31:44.120 --> 1:31:45.120]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:47.120]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:48.120]  Beautiful.
[1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:52.120]  There's ways that we could all be involved if we could all be affected, so that's what I'm calling about.
[1:31:52.120 --> 1:31:53.120]  God bless you, Chris.
[1:31:53.120 --> 1:31:56.120]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[1:31:56.120 --> 1:32:25.120]  Thank you so much.
[1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:51.120]  Thank you.
