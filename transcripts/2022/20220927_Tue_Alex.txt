[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.011]  Tuesday live anti-globalist populism now sweeping Europe.
[00:00:03.392 --> 00:00:04.312]  America is next.
[00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:07.115]  Tune in for live coverage of the war for the future.
[00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.462]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:20.165]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:29.273]  We saw this graphic, this political cartoon.
[00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:31.163]  Radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[00:00:31.183 --> 00:00:31.984]  It shows a tree.
[00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:48.048]  And above the surface, with the branches, it says inflation, high taxes, open borders, globalism, recession, defund the police, violence, human trafficking, fentanyl, deaths.
[00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:49.348]  It goes on and on.
[00:00:50.068 --> 00:01:05.039]   But the problem with the graphic by Branko, a great political cartoonist, is it's got Joe Biden as the root, and the donkey, and Obama, and a sippy cup.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.641]  There's a through line of hate.
[00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:24.793]  From massacres of indigenous people, to the original sin of slavery, the terror of the Klan, to anti-immigration, violence against the Irish, Italians, Chinese, Mexicans, so many of those laced through our history.
[00:01:26.754 --> 00:01:31.494]   There's a through line of violence against religious groups, anti-Semitic, anti-Catholic,
[00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:35.113]  anti-Mormon, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Sikh.
[00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:38.634]  And that through line of hate never fully goes away.
[00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:42.994]   But the root causes are really the globalists like Klaus Schwab.
[00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:46.754]  They're grooming a younger generation of globalist talent.
[00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.952]  They're focused on cultivating this next generation.
[00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.773]  And they've proven that they're quite good at this.
[00:01:52.174 --> 00:01:54.335]  This is a quote from Schwab in 2017.
[00:01:55.395 --> 00:02:04.059]  I have to say that when I mention now names like Miss Angela Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they've all been young global leaders at the WEF.
[00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.301]  But what we're very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
[00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.416]  We penetrate the cabinet.
[00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:15.818]  But we see he's complimenting himself for doing what?
[00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.962]  Infiltrating the Canadian government, grooming the Prime Minister, and then infiltrating his cabinet.
[00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:25.204]  So again, where does that leave the Daily Beast and their theory that this is some sort of a conspiracy?
[00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:33.235]   This is all a rebrand or a relaunch of the New World Order, which was again called a Conspiracy.
[00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:33.815]  Right.
[00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:36.919]  And it was to create a totalitarian world government.
[00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.986]  Perhaps something akin to what we've seen from the UN, from the EU, or the WHO.
[00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.248]  They've been in the news a little bit lately.
[00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:49.254]  Unelected, unaccountable to the people, but they tell you what to do with your lives.
[00:02:49.454 --> 00:03:00.824]  So what the great reset architects believe is that modern democracy and a free market capitalism, not the kind of capitalism we have today, we'll talk about that in a little bit, but the free market capitalism has failed.
[00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:07.370]  And the only way to fix it is by marrying corporate interests and the increasingly powerful state.
[00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:11.975]  This will create corporatist super states or maybe one day a super state.
[00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:14.416]  That will see a new world government take shape.
[00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:15.257]  It's already happening.
[00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:22.601]  Though it might not necessarily take the form of a government, it's a functional dictatorship via corporations.
[00:03:22.642 --> 00:03:24.303]  That's what they're doing, and it's already happening.
[00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:27.905]  And his corporate controllers, like Bill Gates.
[00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:33.148]  This guy's unelected, and he's got way too much influence in global healthcare.
[00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:36.150]  He's a college dropout.
[00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.592]  He's not even a coder.
[00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:39.292]  Did you know that?
[00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:40.653]  He doesn't write code.
[00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.862]  He's just a monopolist.
[00:03:45.022 --> 00:03:46.543]  He's a criminal and a monopolist.
[00:03:47.044 --> 00:03:52.367]  And he went to Jeffrey Epstein's island, which makes a lot of people say he's a child raper.
[00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:56.410]  He told Trump, don't set up a commission to study vaccines.
[00:03:57.331 --> 00:03:58.311]  That would be a dead end.
[00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:00.313]  That would be a bad thing.
[00:04:00.753 --> 00:04:01.033]  Why?
[00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:02.974]  What are they going to find out?
[00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:05.516]  They're going to find out that vaccines are safe and effective, right?
[00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:06.657]  Wouldn't that be good?
[00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:12.481]  And the King of England who is involved in all this eugenics and depopulation, King Charles III.
[00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:23.390]  At the moment we've so degraded natural systems, ecosystems, biodiversity, that it's becoming increasingly impossible for nature to sustain us.
[00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:25.292]  At the moment it's all take-take.
[00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:33.118]  Now we've reached the situation where we really need four planets like Earth to survive or to provide enough for everybody.
[00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:35.821]  But really at the end of the day, it's the devil.
[00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:37.534]  Is it the root?
[00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:49.416]  The root cause, ladies and gentlemen, is not King Charles, not Bill Gates, not Klaus Schwab, not the donkey, but it's evil.
[00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:57.058]  Call it what you want, you can say what it is, you can play games all day, but this is a fight between good versus evil.
[00:04:57.778 --> 00:05:00.978]  And everything the New World Order does is destructive of their own interest.
[00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.998]   They go out of their way to kill, steal, and destroy, Because they hate God's creation.
[00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:08.278]  They hate human destiny.
[00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:12.620]  They are fundamentally, spiritually jealous of the tree of life.
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.821]  And they want the tree of death.
[00:05:18.062 --> 00:05:18.602]  We'll be back.
[00:05:21.543 --> 00:05:30.058]   Thank you for joining us on this live, power-packed, Liberty Fueled, Tuesday, September 27th, broadcast.
[00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.181]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:36.626]  We're here for the next four hours out of the War Room with the great Owen Schroyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:43.134]  Central, on The Black Sheep, verboten, tip of the spear, InfoWars, radio, TV, internet, network.
[00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:49.446]  The Coordinates of Liberty and Resistance are InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.868]  Tuesday live, anti-globalist populism now sweeping Europe.
[00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:54.169]  America is next.
[00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.970]  Tune in for live coverage of the war for the future.
[00:05:58.511 --> 00:05:58.812]  Wow!
[00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:11.480]  Well, now they've had more European Union officials, not just the head of the unelected EU, say they're going to have sanctions on Italy for daring to elect their first female Prime Minister.
[00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:22.075]  Who is an eloquent, beautiful, wonderful, pro-human, populist, anti-globalist who explains that technocracy via the WEF is taking over.
[00:06:23.076 --> 00:06:24.758]  They've increased their prices on average over 700%.
[00:06:24.798 --> 00:06:25.639]  Gas or natural gas is up 900%.
[00:06:25.478 --> 00:06:34.278]   Gas or natural gas is up 900%. She sweeps to power and they call her a
[00:06:34.278 --> 00:06:40.598]   fascist that worships Benito Mussolini with no evidence because she says God
[00:06:40.598 --> 00:06:47.478]  country family just like the Brazilian president Bolsonaro.
[00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:59.925]  But even the former Prime Minister, Mateo Renzi, went on CNN last night and said, she is not a fascist and she is not Mussolini.
[00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:01.125]  This is fake news.
[00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.769]   Giorgio Meloni. So I'm not the best friend and we grew up together in politics, but we
[00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:16.928]   were, we are and will be rivals always. At the same time, I think that is not a danger
[00:07:16.928 --> 00:07:19.050]  for Italian democracy.
[00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:21.470]  She is my rival.
[00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:22.551]  I'm rival.
[00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:25.533]  We will continue to fight each other.
[00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:34.397]  But the ideas are now there is a risk of fascism in Italy is absolutely a fake news.
[00:07:34.858 --> 00:07:46.521]   She won election particularly because populism a lot of times won in Italy, she has a majority government, majority coalition
[00:07:46.521 --> 00:07:52.639]   and probably she will be, I think, next month, the next Prime Minister.
[00:07:52.639 --> 00:08:02.360]   So, she is not a fascist, she is not Mussolini, we all know that, but the media across the
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.920]   world continues to call her that, just like they call Trump supporters or the Santa supporters
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.841]   or InfoWars supporters or supporters just of common sense, populism and free market
[00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:14.961]  ideas, Nazis.
[00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:24.961]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:17.888]  Well now the final votes are in.
[00:08:17.908 --> 00:08:21.770]  She's won a big majority in the parliamentary system.
[00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.393]  Leftist former Italian PM says return of fascism narrative is absolutely fake news.
[00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:31.435]  The full article and full interview is on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:32.475]  I suggest you share it.
[00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:36.858]  It's a major bellwether of where America is going and the rest of the world.
[00:08:37.498 --> 00:08:37.918]  Video.
[00:08:37.998 --> 00:08:44.942]  French Prime Minister declares EU will be vigilant against the threat of democratically elected Italian leader.
[00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:48.574]  Because they are the tyrants.
[00:08:50.835 --> 00:09:01.722]  Meanwhile, in Europe, a blast has been detected near the Nord Stream, as images reveal huge leak to Nord Stream 1 that supplies much of Europe with its gas.
[00:09:01.762 --> 00:09:02.903]  In fact, the majority of its gas.
[00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:07.846]  The EU's already blocked Nord Stream 1 to Europe, causing massive price increases.
[00:09:08.207 --> 00:09:14.591]  But now Nord Stream 1, Nord Stream 2 has been never allowed to open, but Nord Stream 1 is in trouble.
[00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:18.056]  This is all part of the Great Reset, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:23.365]  German government thinks Russian gas pipelines could have been deliberately sabotaged.
[00:09:24.067 --> 00:09:27.452]  We're going to be getting more into that here today.
[00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:32.972]  That ties into the numbers coming out on the economy, not just here, but all over the world.
[00:09:33.352 --> 00:09:34.894]  The housing bubble has officially burst.
[00:09:35.894 --> 00:09:40.958]  Cass Schiller records first drop in home prices since 2012.
[00:09:41.719 --> 00:09:45.621]  American farmers warn of severe food shortages beyond their control.
[00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:48.904]  It is on like Donkey Kong.
[00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:51.526]  Also, major new study is out.
[00:09:53.001 --> 00:10:00.603]  Trace amounts of COVID-19 mRNA messenger systems were detected in the breast milk of some lactating women.
[00:10:01.003 --> 00:10:15.027]  Caution is warned regarding breastfeeding infants younger than six months in the first two days after maternal COVID-19 vaccination, which we warned of with top scientists two years ago before the deadly injections began.
[00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:17.768]  We have huge developments on that front.
[00:10:18.735 --> 00:10:22.197]  We have Nancy Pelosi being booed everywhere she goes.
[00:10:22.217 --> 00:10:30.262]  We've got a few clips of that, including a group of Hispanic Americans shouting her down, saying, you are a liar.
[00:10:30.722 --> 00:10:34.405]  Everywhere these criminals go, people are in their faces.
[00:10:34.465 --> 00:10:42.190]  Even at liberal events, like the Global Citizen event this weekend in New York, she was booed with her disgusting family off the stage.
[00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.532]  More rejection of the New World Order.
[00:10:45.012 --> 00:10:47.955]  Fake meat sales plummet on high prices.
[00:10:48.255 --> 00:10:49.697]  Even the left isn't buying them.
[00:10:50.137 --> 00:10:55.342]  And you've got some of the heads of the companies of the fake meat operations being caught in major scams.
[00:10:55.823 --> 00:10:57.825]  We'll be getting to all of that.
[00:10:59.407 --> 00:11:06.354]  There's just so much we're going to be discussing and laying out and breaking down here today.
[00:11:07.549 --> 00:11:11.216]  Also, there's a compilation on BandOutVideo and it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:13.440]  It's 40 minutes long, I won't air the whole thing, but...
[00:11:15.208 --> 00:11:25.431]  Twenty years and counting of Alex Jones battling pedophiles and predicting pedophile armies to try to take over society and legalize pedophilia, which is happening now.
[00:11:25.451 --> 00:11:35.193]  I actually forgot to get to that clip yesterday, but guys, re-pull it, of the Spain's Minister of Equality saying children should have sex with adults.
[00:11:35.253 --> 00:11:39.495]  We have the video of her on national TV saying it's their right to do it.
[00:11:40.275 --> 00:11:44.196]  Is it their right to be drafted at age 10 to the military or their right to be sold whiskey?
[00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:45.360]  No.
[00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:51.305]  Children do not have the age of consent because they've not developed their minds yet.
[00:11:51.385 --> 00:11:54.707]  That's why we don't hold them as guilty when they commit crimes.
[00:11:55.268 --> 00:11:57.690]  Because they're not able to make cognizant decisions.
[00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.272]  And you pedophiles need to stay the hell away from them.
[00:12:02.353 --> 00:12:03.533]  It's all coming up today.
[00:12:04.434 --> 00:12:13.957]  Now, let me make a major announcement here that is extremely important for you and your family, and your health, and your future, and for the future of InfoWars, which is obviously critical in the fight against tyranny.
[00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:19.339]  I went ahead and decided to do the biggest sale of the year today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:23.743]  And we are launching this mega massive sale today.

[00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:02.513]  People have been begging for it.

[00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:05.015]  Just came in yesterday.

[00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:43.125]   'Cause a small percentage of people cannot absorb absolutely pure atomic iodine.
[00:13:43.152 --> 00:13:44.932]  That is X2, which is incredible and amazing.
[00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:51.114]  X3 is pure atomic deep earth iodine with the other two types of healthy iodine.
[00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.994]  So you get the trifecta, and it is amazing.
[00:13:54.074 --> 00:13:55.134]  It is back in stock for $19.95.
[00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:59.135]  X3, back in stock, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:00.916]  So be sure and stock up on that.
[00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:02.956]  Who knows when we'll have it back in stock again.
[00:14:03.476 --> 00:14:07.237]  X3, back in stock, part of the Infowar's mega blowout sale.

[00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:15.481]  It's not the Mega Sale.
[00:14:15.501 --> 00:14:17.062]  The Super Sale, now live.
[00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:20.824]  All the numbers are coming in from around the world.
[00:14:20.924 --> 00:14:36.153]  Populism is exploding and the leaders and the people know that it's the IMF and the World Bank and the WEF and it's Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and King Charles that are spearheading this attack on humanity.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.843]  But let's remember the operating system of these people is pedophilia and the destruction of innocence and no parental rights over children.
[00:14:45.383 --> 00:14:53.867]  So here's Spain's Minister of Equality, Irene Matero, saying children have the right to consent to sexual relations with adults.
[00:14:53.907 --> 00:14:56.909]  We have it closed captioned, and she spends it as a right.
[00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.410]  She goes, children have a right to not be raped.
[00:15:00.609 --> 00:15:03.752]  But they have a right to have sex with adults if they want to.
[00:15:04.452 --> 00:15:06.574]  That's what they're teaching in mainline college.
[00:15:06.995 --> 00:15:08.336]  These people are monsters.
[00:15:08.596 --> 00:15:10.138]  You don't have a right to be legally spied on.
[00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:12.720]  You don't have a right to be not injected with GMO shots.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.442]  You don't have a right to not be chemtrailed.
[00:15:14.462 --> 00:15:16.684]  You don't have a right to not live in a world government.
[00:15:16.884 --> 00:15:18.685]  You don't have a right to have your currency devalued.
[00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:19.926]  You don't have any real rights.
[00:15:20.307 --> 00:15:20.847]  But you know what?
[00:15:20.887 --> 00:15:25.672]  Your kids have a right to have sex with people or to have the school tell them to change what sex they are.
[00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:27.773]  This is a pervert army.
[00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:38.181]  I'm going to play some clips, a whole 40-minute compilation on Infowars.com, but a few clips of me 20 years ago, 2002 and on, laying out what was coming in the future and what they were going to do.
[00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:39.282]  Go watch the 40 minutes.
[00:15:39.682 --> 00:15:43.505]  It'll blow your mind to see where we're at and where this is going, but here she is.
[00:15:45.159 --> 00:16:07.399]  But to talk about sexual education, for example, which is a right of boys and girls, ma'am, regardless of who their families are, because all boys and girls in this country have the right to know their own body, to know that no adult can touch their body if they don't want to, if they don't want to, and that this is a form of violence.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:23.533]  There are acknowledged rights that your children should be able to have sex with adults.
[00:16:23.773 --> 00:16:25.055]  You are a sick monster.
[00:16:25.355 --> 00:16:26.416]  But they're just normalizing it.
[00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:29.359]  The pedos and their allies are coming out of the closet.
[00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:35.704]   Most of the people aiding the pedos aren't part of it, but the pedos will give them power, money, anything, Give them access to children.
[00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:36.704]  It's their one thought.
[00:16:37.004 --> 00:16:37.885]  Destroy their innocence.
[00:16:38.305 --> 00:16:40.947]  Let's go back on the time machine, then we'll go to break in about seven minutes.
[00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:44.308]  I'll come back with all the other news of where I was laying this out 20 years ago.
[00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:47.630]  We posted about six different stories last week.
[00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.091]  People requested to see them again.
[00:16:50.272 --> 00:17:03.499]  Where the majority of police officers and social workers here in the US and in England who deal with child protective services are pedophiles.
[00:17:05.134 --> 00:17:06.675]  Well, I'd like this to be explained to me.
[00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:08.556]  This is from CNN.
[00:17:10.357 --> 00:17:14.759]  Florida can't find 1,000 kids in state custody.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:22.144]  Now, about a month ago I was driving down the road listening to the local affiliate that carries my radio show, News Talk 1260, KWNX.
[00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:36.763]  And I heard the Associated Press, they have an AP radio, I heard them announce that the number is no longer 2,000, because this is a thousand here, no longer 2,000, but it is now 3,500 missing children.
[00:17:37.504 --> 00:17:44.372]   And I printed that article off the Associated Press and read it several days on the radio and Today I was leaving the office and was digging through the stacks and couldn't find it.
[00:17:44.592 --> 00:17:48.255]  The latest one I could find was from June 4, 2002.
[00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:53.699]  You can go to Google and type Florida can't find 3,500 kids in state custody.
[00:17:53.859 --> 00:17:56.260]  It's a similar headline.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.741]  It'll pop up for you.
[00:17:58.662 --> 00:18:00.083]  But, okay, let's just say it's 1,000.
[00:18:00.183 --> 00:18:03.486]  This is the article I could find leaving the broadcast studio today.
[00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:05.427]  The Hacienda.
[00:18:07.048 --> 00:18:07.568]  CNN.
[00:18:08.209 --> 00:18:10.951]  Florida can't find 1,000 kids in state custody.
[00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.611]  So what does it matter if it's $3,500 or $1,000?
[00:18:14.651 --> 00:18:15.651]  It's equally bad.
[00:18:16.151 --> 00:18:25.094]  Now this all broke out when this little black girl, two years old, had been taken a year and a half ago and no one could find her.
[00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:32.698]  When they couldn't find her, didn't know where they'd place her, had no record, nothing was done.
[00:18:32.758 --> 00:18:39.483]  No one was charged with child endangerment, some lesser charge, no kidnapping charges, no one's been arrested.
[00:18:39.943 --> 00:18:47.950]  And then some groups started checking and it was 200 missing, 500 missing, 1,000 missing, 1,200 missing, 2,000 missing.
[00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:54.915]  I followed this, a lot of you listen to my radio show, you know every week I would announce several times, the number's at 1,200, it's at 1,400, it's at 1,500, it's at 1,800, it's at 2,000.
[00:18:58.758 --> 00:19:03.563]  And then I'm driving down the road and I hear the AP announce that it's 3,500.
[00:19:03.623 --> 00:19:04.564]  I go home angrily.
[00:19:04.584 --> 00:19:06.466]  I'm literally sick over this.
[00:19:06.907 --> 00:19:08.429]  I go and it's 3,500.
[00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:13.414]  Now it was bad enough these children are missing that the government took from families.
[00:19:15.496 --> 00:19:19.818]   But the big story was Because let's admit it, the U.N.
[00:19:19.838 --> 00:19:21.478]  kills hundreds of thousands of kids every year.
[00:19:21.498 --> 00:19:22.799]  They get caught all the time.
[00:19:23.299 --> 00:19:24.940]  There's 3,500, nothing compared to them.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:32.704]  And there's slave brothels and the slave centers and the 1.2 million women they're kidnapping and shipping out of Eastern Europe and Central Europe.
[00:19:32.744 --> 00:19:33.944]  That's mainstream news.
[00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:35.085]  I'm sure you might have heard about that.
[00:19:35.365 --> 00:19:36.406]  This is all giant U.N.
[00:19:36.426 --> 00:19:37.086]  slave brothels.
[00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:38.887]  They've got slave liner ships.
[00:19:39.487 --> 00:19:40.307]  That's been in the news.
[00:19:40.528 --> 00:19:41.088]  You don't believe me?
[00:19:41.168 --> 00:19:41.468]  Fine.
[00:19:41.488 --> 00:19:42.228]  Okay, don't check it out.
[00:19:42.729 --> 00:19:43.589]  This is all documented.
[00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:44.750]  I don't care how horrible it sounds.
[00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:45.470]  It's all documented.
[00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.851]  I've covered it all here a hundred times.
[00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:49.171]  Then I come across this story.
[00:19:49.411 --> 00:19:53.072]  This was back in September 7th, the Miami Herald.
[00:19:55.013 --> 00:19:58.834]  State child welfare payroll includes employees who have criminal past.
[00:19:59.394 --> 00:20:01.634]  That's putting it likely.
[00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:13.357]  At least 183 people have been arrested and punished for an array of felonies including child molestation, child abuse, sex crimes, drug dealing, even welfare fraud against the agency itself.
[00:20:14.318 --> 00:20:15.598]  A Herald investigation is found.
[00:20:17.728 --> 00:20:19.389]  Now, why does the government want criminals working for it?
[00:20:19.829 --> 00:20:21.189]  But they're not in low-level positions.
[00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:32.534]  One of them is a convicted child rapist, and he runs the state's database of missing children and children in the custody.
[00:20:34.795 --> 00:20:36.956]  3,500 children missing.
[00:20:36.976 --> 00:20:39.217]  Again, this is the only article I could find.
[00:20:39.277 --> 00:20:40.217]  I thought to do this today.
[00:20:40.237 --> 00:20:41.338]  I went and dug around and found this one.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.640]  It's now 3,500 reported by the Associated Press.
[00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:53.562]  And it says, for instance, that the agency's data security team in Tallahassee is listed on the state's list of sexual predators for molesting a five-year-old boy.
[00:20:57.503 --> 00:20:58.283]  They don't know where 3,500 are.
[00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:01.763]   three thousand five hundred are child
[00:21:01.763 --> 00:21:10.863]   rapists runs the system
[00:21:10.863 --> 00:21:23.403]   this is in crime in folks this stuff is in question [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:22.231]  It also says that they also, DCF will not disclose, these are just records that were found by the news checking on people's names.
[00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:30.394]  I found 183, the agency won't... They're not required to have people that aren't felons, it says.
[00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:40.956]  Well, this one guy was director of Miami Services, grabbing the children.
[00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:46.259]  And he's a convicted cokehead.
[00:21:47.159 --> 00:21:51.421]  And they got everybody.
[00:21:53.042 --> 00:21:55.143]  But mainly in key positions is pedophiles.
[00:21:55.163 --> 00:21:57.404]  You're saying, oh yeah, you're taking this out of context.
[00:21:57.444 --> 00:21:58.565]  You know, government loves us.
[00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:00.486]  Where do you think the pedophiles go?
[00:22:00.526 --> 00:22:01.466]  Most of them aren't in prison.
[00:22:01.707 --> 00:22:02.887]  They got badges, folks.
[00:22:03.187 --> 00:22:04.168]  They got machine guns.
[00:22:07.861 --> 00:22:08.281]  You see that?
[00:22:08.421 --> 00:22:10.482]  That's the London Guardian, one of the big papers in England.
[00:22:10.843 --> 00:22:13.284]  Child swoop nets 90 police.
[00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:15.245]  Boy, does that headline put it lightly.
[00:22:16.466 --> 00:22:23.770]  Hundreds of child welfare professionals, including police officers, care workers and teachers, have been identified as extremely high-risk pedophiles by an investigation.
[00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.971]  The discovery came after U.S.
[00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:36.517]  authorities passed on more than 7,200 names connected to a Fort Worth group that was engaging in filming child pornography.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.822]  Goes on that it goes to the highest levels of the government.
[00:22:45.963 --> 00:22:46.783]  This is incredible.
[00:22:48.984 --> 00:22:56.527]  It says that they had 75,000 subscribers to the child porn worldwide just out of Fort Worth.
[00:22:57.667 --> 00:23:01.409]  You know, I made a decision here on this live September 27th broadcast.
[00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:09.252]  I'm going to hit the economy, I'm going to hit the election, I'm going to hit the latest COVID news, and I'm going to open the phones up in the second and third hour today.
[00:23:10.532 --> 00:23:17.075]  But I was sitting here during the break looking at all this incredible news and I thought, we were just playing a clip last segment of me in the year 2022.
[00:23:17.115 --> 00:23:17.515]  20 years ago.
[00:23:17.555 --> 00:23:18.015]  Today is 2022.
[00:23:18.055 --> 00:23:20.296]  In the year 2002.
[00:23:20.155 --> 00:23:32.635]   ago. Today is 2022. In the year 2002, in the year 2002, specifically going into how the
[00:23:32.635 --> 00:23:36.596]  government's put pedophiles in positions of power.
[00:23:36.337 --> 00:23:47.721]  It came out late last year in December that the CIA would only hire pedophiles in Afghanistan to run villages, and they would control them by giving them six, seven, eight-year-old boys.
[00:23:48.842 --> 00:23:49.802]  That's Associated Press.
[00:23:51.109 --> 00:24:06.639]  It came out, of course, two years ago that the German government placed hundreds of thousands of children over several decades with convicted pedophiles in a project to end the family and to create a new form of love, little boys with men, little girls with women.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.742]  That's Der Spiegel, that's DW.com, that's mainstream news.
[00:24:12.162 --> 00:24:18.406]  Even last year, the New Yorker magazine, about a year after the German news broke it, reported on it.
[00:24:18.887 --> 00:24:20.548]  This is industrial level.
[00:24:21.332 --> 00:24:26.051]   And I just played Spain's Minister of Equality saying children should have sex with adults.
[00:24:26.051 --> 00:24:34.452]   And we've shown you drag queen story time all over the country just last week
[00:24:34.452 --> 00:24:41.572]   with the children grabbing the genitals of men and humping children.
[00:24:41.803 --> 00:24:44.666]  They are exercising this evil out in front of us.
[00:24:44.686 --> 00:24:49.691]  So I'm going to play a little bit more from 2002, and it goes right through to about 10 years ago.
[00:24:49.711 --> 00:24:56.757]  We're talking about armies of pedophiles, how they're going to take over, how they're going to come for your children, how they're going to legalize pedophilia, because that was their plan.
[00:24:57.718 --> 00:25:03.003]  So just remember that when you look at a high-level Democrat, most of the time they rape children.
[00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:05.206]  It's come out about Biden, come out about them all.
[00:25:05.866 --> 00:25:25.571]  Now we have a major FBI whistleblower, high-level, the full interview is on Infowars.com, 47 minutes long, explaining that they have put communists and socialists and globalists in most of the positions, even low-level, and they're purging anybody else that's left, that their mission is to persecute the American people.
[00:25:25.631 --> 00:25:28.792]  That's coming up, we'll play some of that, start of the next segment.
[00:25:29.352 --> 00:25:38.603]   But I wanted to go ahead And play a little bit more of this archive 40-minute video, and then I'm going to stop.
[00:25:38.643 --> 00:25:43.144]  But I just think more of this needs to be seen so you know we're not just now saying this.
[00:25:43.184 --> 00:25:45.805]  We predicted it all because you could see where it was going.
[00:25:46.325 --> 00:25:51.026]  Every ancient culture would go through a period of decline and start raping and sacrificing children.
[00:25:51.766 --> 00:25:52.646]  I don't care if you're black.
[00:25:52.766 --> 00:25:53.646]  I don't care if you're Hispanic.
[00:25:53.746 --> 00:25:54.646]  I don't care if you're white.
[00:25:54.927 --> 00:25:55.887]  I don't care if you're Asian.
[00:25:56.247 --> 00:26:01.408]  In your line, in your past, you had ancestors that raped and murdered children.
[00:26:02.328 --> 00:26:04.790]  What happens to us that causes this?
[00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.151]  Well, it's an evil force, folks.
[00:26:08.712 --> 00:26:09.873]  And we've got to admit it exists.
[00:26:09.913 --> 00:26:11.714]  We've got to admit evil is real.
[00:26:11.994 --> 00:26:13.335]  They're not coming for our children.
[00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:15.376]  They've got our children in many cases.
[00:26:16.757 --> 00:26:18.558]  And that's the main reason they want us off air.
[00:26:18.618 --> 00:26:19.979]  But I've now seen it.
[00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:20.699]  I've realized it.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.962]  That when I'm there confronting leftists, they're confronting me wherever we're at.
[00:26:27.159 --> 00:26:31.063]  I see that look in their eye, and then I research the policies they're into and what they support.
[00:26:31.904 --> 00:26:33.846]  Nine times out of ten, they're connected to pedophilia.
[00:26:34.686 --> 00:26:35.607]  These are pedophiles, folks.
[00:26:36.408 --> 00:26:37.389]  We're fighting pedophiles.
[00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.231]  Here's more of the Time Capsule.
[00:26:39.972 --> 00:26:42.194]  This government is just pure evil.
[00:26:44.636 --> 00:26:51.343]  Now, we're getting numbers in now, since this Florida story's gotten some attention, but it's been put on the very low back burner, almost no national attention.
[00:26:52.827 --> 00:26:57.350]  We're now hearing about 700 missing in Georgia, thousands missing in California.
[00:26:59.812 --> 00:27:01.113]  And the government, no one's held accountable.
[00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:02.294]  Okay, we don't know where the kids are.
[00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:03.775]  We took them from homes, we don't know where they are.
[00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:14.463]  And when I get up here and say that pedophile rings are one of the biggest cults or guilds running Washington, that's just what the facts always show.
[00:27:15.123 --> 00:27:16.825]  You know, I may not even cover this.
[00:27:17.925 --> 00:27:20.007]  Just know it's going on in British and U.S.
[00:27:20.027 --> 00:27:20.968]  and European schools.
[00:27:22.788 --> 00:27:23.408]  Know that B.F.
[00:27:23.448 --> 00:27:28.532]  Skinner tortured his son to death over several years in a small box and is hailed for it.
[00:27:29.993 --> 00:27:34.756]  And know that you've got to get evil people to run a criminal government.
[00:27:36.557 --> 00:27:42.441]  And so a lot of their frontline people and a lot of their technocrats and even high level people are part of pedophile guilds.
[00:27:45.286 --> 00:27:55.773]  And so what they're doing is they're legitimizing that parents can't talk to their children, can't dry their children off in England with a towel without being government-registered to touch their child.
[00:27:56.073 --> 00:27:58.375]  So see, they make everybody else a pedophile for no reason.
[00:27:58.755 --> 00:28:00.857]  And then they teach the children in the U.S.
[00:28:00.957 --> 00:28:14.486]  and England how to not just have gay sex when they're six, seven years old, but how to do things like inserting giant, dangerous implements in themselves.
[00:28:15.466 --> 00:28:24.968]  And I can't even... I mean, there's recordings of what, in Massachusetts, they teach elementary school students that I actually played on air about ten years ago and a few affiliates dropped us.
[00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:30.749]  I mean, it was small children brought to a college dormitory and put in beds.
[00:28:31.589 --> 00:28:34.270]  And then the school taught them how to have sex with each other.
[00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.411]  Whether it's heterosexual, homosexual, whatever, it shouldn't be going on and it's wrong.
[00:28:39.895 --> 00:28:45.021]  But I have to say, it is the, quote, gays that are pushing homosexual sex.
[00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:49.446]  And so it seems that because that's a protected group, they're allowed to engage in pedophilia.
[00:28:49.466 --> 00:28:50.787]  We're going to go live right now.
[00:28:50.606 --> 00:29:07.826]   now here we go eat three bottles of tylenol
[00:29:08.504 --> 00:29:14.710]  Did you know girls kill themselves by going and getting all these different bottles of cold medicines that it will kill you.
[00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.111]  But it's painless.
[00:29:16.151 --> 00:29:16.892]  You go to sleep.
[00:29:17.252 --> 00:29:20.715]  Now we're going to show you the basketball diaries of mass shootings in schools.
[00:29:21.075 --> 00:29:22.617]  And then, boom, it all starts.
[00:29:23.618 --> 00:29:24.258]  They know.
[00:29:25.419 --> 00:29:29.363]  And so, oh, let us teach you how to fist each other.
[00:29:29.403 --> 00:29:30.044]  And that's in here.
[00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:32.946]  How to bleed.
[00:29:33.486 --> 00:29:34.707]  How pleasurable it is.
[00:29:36.268 --> 00:29:38.489]  Let us teach you how to do this.
[00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:41.371]  And then if you say, I don't want that, you are arrested.
[00:29:41.852 --> 00:29:44.533]  Because to say you're against it is... I'm not kidding.
[00:29:44.814 --> 00:29:48.376]  Just type Prejudice Raids England.
[00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:53.800]  Robin Page, BBC presenter, said that rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.862]  And that word, homosexual, is illegal if they choose.
[00:29:57.882 --> 00:30:03.026]   They have special social networks, social services boards, This is not a joke.
[00:30:03.046 --> 00:30:04.727]  This is not satire if you're watching this.
[00:30:04.787 --> 00:30:05.408]  This is happening.
[00:30:07.109 --> 00:30:09.872]  So they just destroy the innocence of these children.
[00:30:11.433 --> 00:30:12.654]  And this is part of the recruiting.
[00:30:12.754 --> 00:30:18.739]  And the eugenicists cold-bloodedly do this so people don't have children.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:19.940]  Appropriation.
[00:30:20.561 --> 00:30:22.442]  This is about... And then they say this in the twenties.
[00:30:22.462 --> 00:30:23.664]  They say, we're going to teach this in schools.
[00:30:25.017 --> 00:30:26.297]  So people don't have children anymore.
[00:30:27.398 --> 00:30:30.438]  And so now they're targeting your children for over a decade.
[00:30:31.139 --> 00:30:36.100]  And, you know, they're going to corrupt your children.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.481]  You put them in a government training camp, you're out of your mind.
[00:30:40.821 --> 00:30:44.742]  But I'm against heterosexual or homosexual indoctrination of five-year-olds.
[00:30:45.102 --> 00:30:45.762]  Twelve-year-olds.
[00:30:46.542 --> 00:30:47.023]  Ten-year-olds.
[00:30:47.083 --> 00:30:48.243]  But I mean, this is five-year-olds.
[00:30:49.099 --> 00:31:00.849]  And God Almighty, folks, we've played the tapes from the classrooms where they bus the seven, eight, nine-year-olds to college dorms and put them in beds together, and then they teach them and have them, you know, it's open pedophilia.
[00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:02.430]  It's now legal in the country.
[00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.114]  Selectively, the only government can practice open pedophilia.
[00:31:07.614 --> 00:31:13.257]  That's why you've had so many Homeland Security State Directors, Deputy Directors caught, because the whole government isn't bad.
[00:31:13.337 --> 00:31:18.981]  All the police aren't bad, all the military isn't bad, the whole system isn't corrupt yet, so they keep busting their own people.
[00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:28.326]  Texas Youth Commission, giant rape rooms, public rape- rape-rariums, I've coined a term, I mean literally, it's just, it's just hell has been released.
[00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:31.588]  I will spend some time on Penn State.
[00:31:33.429 --> 00:31:48.579]   Now, I waited to really talk about this, I don't know, on Monday and Tuesday I said this is going to go much deeper than just one football coach because I've seen this before.
[00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:57.104]  And I said the Texas Youth Commission on record, even when the Texas Rangers found out about it and blew the whistle, it was covered up.
[00:31:57.985 --> 00:32:02.928]  And it's come out in state hearings that had youth commissions all over the state of Texas.
[00:32:03.208 --> 00:32:04.188]  It's all over the country too.
[00:32:05.447 --> 00:32:13.836]  They have children ages 6, 7, 8 up to 17 and that the parking lot fills full of the pedophile rings.
[00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:22.686]  Police, judges, mayors, corporate people and they go in and they have sex with the young prisoners.
[00:32:24.758 --> 00:32:29.342]  I mean, I've been in juvenile twice for fighting before they figured out I didn't start the fight because somebody was hurt.
[00:32:29.362 --> 00:32:29.962]  You go to jail.
[00:32:30.322 --> 00:32:35.847]  And of my two times, one time the guard tried to get me in the shower and said, come to the time for your shower.
[00:32:35.867 --> 00:32:37.148]  He said, take your clothes off.
[00:32:37.168 --> 00:32:38.228]  Sitting there licking his lips.
[00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:40.350]  And I said, and he started reaching out at me.
[00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:49.477]  And I said, listen, the reason our enemies are winning is we will not grow up and admit the level of evil we're all dealing with.
[00:32:50.598 --> 00:32:52.780]  I mean, I showed you a video 30 minutes ago.
[00:32:54.022 --> 00:32:56.864]  Of the Minister of Equality in Spain.
[00:33:01.787 --> 00:33:03.548]  Saying children need to have sex with adults.
[00:33:06.329 --> 00:33:09.929]  And I could show you countless other statements like that.
[00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:18.409]  And these people are taking over.
[00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:20.459]  They're taking over every facet of our lives.
[00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:23.895]  Because they want to own the children.
[00:33:24.235 --> 00:33:30.359]  And if they can have sex with your children, they believe that's a strong relationship that you're going to have with them.
[00:33:30.659 --> 00:33:31.700]  It's really just that simple.
[00:33:34.782 --> 00:33:39.364]  You know, you read about serial killers that want to do horrible things to people.
[00:33:42.326 --> 00:33:43.627]  And you think, that doesn't make sense.
[00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:49.827]  Why would anybody act like that?
[00:33:49.827 --> 00:34:00.067]  Because they're bad people.
[00:34:00.263 --> 00:34:01.924]  They enjoy going against God.
[00:34:02.645 --> 00:34:04.506]  They enjoy doing destructive things.
[00:34:07.429 --> 00:34:07.949]  They like it.
[00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:11.192]  It's their religion.
[00:34:14.415 --> 00:34:19.599]  And until we realize that, we won't understand why would they want to inject us with something that erases our immune system?
[00:34:21.841 --> 00:34:27.368]   Why would they want to Give us an injection that causes heart attacks.
[00:34:27.368 --> 00:34:38.368]  Why would they want to give children blood clots?
[00:34:38.368 --> 00:34:48.368]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:39.495 --> 00:34:42.696]  Because to them, that's powerful to rob somebody of their future.
[00:34:43.316 --> 00:34:45.517]  To them, that's like a major score.
[00:34:47.278 --> 00:34:51.400]  It's about their selfishness and their will to do terrible things.
[00:34:53.055 --> 00:34:54.296]  And that's who Bill Gates is.
[00:34:54.736 --> 00:34:55.977]  That's who Klaus Schwab is.
[00:34:56.357 --> 00:34:57.358]  That's who these guys are.
[00:34:57.418 --> 00:34:59.359]  They are heavyweight predators.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.920]  Heavyweight killers.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:10.438]  They're absolute bottomless pits.
[00:35:10.438 --> 00:35:20.438]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:15.008 --> 00:35:16.889]  So we can talk about these issues all day.
[00:35:21.071 --> 00:35:22.112]  We can sit here and discuss them.
[00:35:26.192 --> 00:35:34.736]  But at a certain point, just sitting there wringing our hands doesn't really do anything.
[00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:40.398]  Just think about these people.
[00:35:40.418 --> 00:36:00.438]   It's been our acquiescence and our submission and the fact that we're caught in the routine or the habit of submitting to evil that now There's basically no limit to what we're going to put up
[00:36:00.438 --> 00:36:00.608]  with.
[00:36:00.608 --> 00:36:14.608]   And the crazy part is you can't just bury your head in the sand and run off and hope this all goes away.
[00:36:14.608 --> 00:36:19.608]  Thank you.
[00:36:19.059 --> 00:36:23.361]  Because it only gets worse the more that we submit to it.
[00:36:27.096 --> 00:36:30.078]  The good news is humanity in general is rejecting this poison.
[00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:33.040]  But it's not rejecting it fast enough.
[00:36:34.721 --> 00:36:35.622]  And that's why we're here.
[00:36:36.603 --> 00:36:37.724]  That's why we do what we do.
[00:36:38.644 --> 00:36:40.405]  It's why we're the main target of these people.
[00:36:41.706 --> 00:36:44.088]  It's because they want to try to silence us and shut us down.
[00:36:44.729 --> 00:36:49.292]  Because they know if they can take out the leadership resisting them, it'll be easy to pick all the rest of you off.
[00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:52.714]  They don't want any type of opposition to form and gain any steam.
[00:36:53.355 --> 00:36:54.976]  They openly say that's why they fear us.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.502]  That's why the fight against these people is InfoWars.
[00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:01.944]  You think I want to be up here six, seven days a week?
[00:37:01.964 --> 00:37:04.005]  You think I want to be up here asking for your support constantly?
[00:37:04.025 --> 00:37:11.911]  You think I want to be here jacking with the legal system and fighting these horrible people and interfacing with the zombie dead that serve them?
[00:37:13.132 --> 00:37:15.734]  But I'll do it for the children because God demands it.
[00:37:16.715 --> 00:37:27.713]   Because the pain of not standing up against their corruption, the pain of turning my will over to these devils, is far more Excruciating than resisting them.
[00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:44.328]  There's all these unborn children everywhere crying out for support, and all these born children being targeted and groomed and attacked, and it's our responsibility to stand with them against these soulless, degenerate freaks.
[00:37:48.212 --> 00:37:50.194]  And humanity is rejecting them, and that's the good news.
[00:37:51.266 --> 00:37:55.348]  Fake meat sales plummet on high prices woke message.
[00:37:56.469 --> 00:37:57.910]  They're trying to force-feed it on us.
[00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:08.075]  And all they are is a giant diet of hormone-filled poison that'll turn a man into a woman and a woman into some type of orc creature that gets cancer quickly.
[00:38:10.356 --> 00:38:11.237]  All right, I'm gonna do this.
[00:38:12.417 --> 00:38:13.758]  I'm gonna reset and get focus.
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:19.321]  But at a certain point, I know why people turn away from this evil.
[00:38:19.761 --> 00:38:20.602]  You're sick of looking at it.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.241]  You're sick of talking about it.
[00:38:22.281 --> 00:38:23.261]  You're sick of focusing on it.
[00:38:23.621 --> 00:38:25.462]  But ignoring it doesn't make it go away.
[00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:26.763]  It only makes it get worse.
[00:38:27.984 --> 00:38:29.364]  So I'll just say this to listeners.
[00:38:30.985 --> 00:38:32.686]  I have a win-win proposal for you.
[00:38:33.387 --> 00:38:34.667]  And I need funds to stay on air.

[00:38:37.669 --> 00:38:38.810]  So why wouldn't you get them from us?
[00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.292]  We have the InfoWars super sale going right now.

[00:39:48.809 --> 00:39:51.591]  And then let me talk about this real briefly, and we'll put it on screen.
[00:39:52.832 --> 00:39:54.213]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:39:56.408 --> 00:40:03.432]  A few months ago, I filed Chapter 5 bankruptcy because we were maxed out and out of funds and barely paying the bills.
[00:40:03.952 --> 00:40:09.215]  And the corporate media was lying in my show trial, saying I have $400 million total fraud.
[00:40:09.796 --> 00:40:12.057]  Big surprise by the corporate media on the other side.
[00:40:14.318 --> 00:40:23.383]  And in a Chapter 5, as long as you can go through the Chapter 5 and reorganize, because we were in trouble, then it shows how much extra money you have.
[00:40:24.024 --> 00:40:28.432]   And the other side, going into the future, gets whatever profit there is,
[00:40:28.432 --> 00:40:33.313]   but this place hardly ever runs a profit, so whatever, I'll do whatever to stay on air.
[00:40:33.313 --> 00:40:34.532]  'Cause they don't want the money.
[00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.733]   They said that in the Texas trial, they said that in the Connecticut show trial.
[00:40:37.733 --> 00:40:41.493]  We don't want the money, we want to shut him down.
[00:40:41.493 --> 00:40:43.653]  So we don't give them what they want.
[00:40:43.653 --> 00:40:46.711]  We go through the chapter five.
[00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:54.653]   This company then is in an agreement into the future to pay a percentage of its profits to these people,
[00:40:54.653 --> 00:40:55.613]  which they don't want.
[00:40:55.613 --> 00:40:57.773]  They print the money, they have unlimited money.
[00:40:57.773 --> 00:41:01.412]   They're the Deep State, they're Bloomberg, they're Soros, they're the Globalist.
[00:41:01.412 --> 00:41:05.533]  So it's the good path to go forward with.
[00:41:05.533 --> 00:41:12.973]   But we have to be solvent through the bankruptcy process to be able to achieve that and keep InfoWars
[00:41:12.973 --> 00:41:17.833]   and this infrastructure and Greg Reese and Derrick McBreen and John Bowne
[00:41:17.833 --> 00:41:24.132]   and all the writers and all the crew and all the platforms and all the guests we have on air.
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.381]  It's very simple.
[00:41:24.521 --> 00:41:26.221]  Now is get us across the line point.
[00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:28.622]  Now is two minutes to midnight.
[00:41:28.702 --> 00:41:32.102]  Now is the final seconds of the football game in a dead heat.
[00:41:33.443 --> 00:41:34.643]  Tied and we've got the ball.
[00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.162]  So go to InfoWarsRaw.com and get great products.
[00:41:38.222 --> 00:41:45.385]  But the bankruptcy court said you need to pay 40% of the attorney's fees for these trials and for the bankruptcy.
[00:41:45.705 --> 00:41:46.345]  I don't have the money.
[00:41:49.266 --> 00:41:52.368]  And so I'm launching SaveInfoWars.com.
[00:41:53.068 --> 00:41:55.289]  You've donated in the past to keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:41:56.178 --> 00:41:59.880]  You've donated in the past to help us, and you did it, and you're the reason we're here.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.182]  This is a big fight, and we're in the 12th round.
[00:42:02.882 --> 00:42:24.662]   But SaveInfoWars.com is now directed to a new GiveSendGo, those great patriots' site, Alex Jones Legal, for my bills that I don't have the money to pay to finish up this show trial, the next show trial, and that's over, to pay for the appeals, And to pay for the bankruptcy, because I'm maxed out.
[00:42:24.982 --> 00:42:25.763]  So I thank you.
[00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:26.663]  I'm not pressuring you.
[00:42:26.803 --> 00:42:32.364]  I'm telling you, there's nowhere you can fund somebody more toe-to-toe with the Globalist Infowars and Alex Jones.
[00:42:32.384 --> 00:42:34.724]  So this is specifically for Alex Jones.
[00:42:35.564 --> 00:42:41.545]  This is specifically for my legal bills, which they're making me pay, which I don't have the money for if this continues just a few months.
[00:42:42.205 --> 00:42:44.126]  So SaveInfowars.com.
[00:42:44.746 --> 00:42:52.746]   SaveInfoWars.com takes you to the GiveSinGo.com/AlexJonesLegal, where you can make a donation.
[00:42:52.746 --> 00:42:57.026]   Thank you for all your past support, but all your investment up to now is for naught
[00:42:57.026 --> 00:43:00.985]   if we don't continue to fight this most critical time while the whole world's waking up
[00:43:00.985 --> 00:43:04.465]   and while we're getting anti-globalist patriots elected everywhere.
[00:43:04.465 --> 00:43:07.826]   We're winning, but we've gotta have the will to keep the fight going.
[00:43:07.826 --> 00:43:11.425]  So go now to SaveInfoWars.com, and I thank you.
[00:43:12.785 --> 00:43:15.365]  (upbeat music)
[00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:17.945]  (upbeat music)
[00:43:18.706 --> 00:43:20.905]  (upbeat music)
[00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:24.945]  It's the fourth coin that we've released in the last year.
[00:43:25.446 --> 00:43:26.648]  And I believe the most powerful.
[00:43:27.068 --> 00:43:30.132]  The man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:43:31.674 --> 00:43:33.076]  Citizen of a republic.
[00:43:34.138 --> 00:43:35.119]  The man in the arena.
[00:43:35.679 --> 00:43:37.700]  There's only 10,000 of this coin.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.081]  It exists in the world.
[00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:41.082]  It will never be made again.
[00:43:41.102 --> 00:43:43.704]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[00:43:44.124 --> 00:43:47.366]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[00:43:47.726 --> 00:43:49.888]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[00:43:50.268 --> 00:43:51.469]  This is something you want to own.
[00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:57.212]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[00:43:57.753 --> 00:44:00.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[00:44:00.134 --> 00:44:01.175]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[00:44:01.855 --> 00:44:04.537]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[00:44:05.377 --> 00:44:11.702]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[00:44:12.002 --> 00:44:16.385]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the Infowar.
[00:44:17.085 --> 00:44:18.787]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.

[00:44:37.222 --> 00:44:39.222]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:44:39.222 --> 00:44:52.740]   With our government guilty of pushing a deadly experimental vaccine, robbing the nation of
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:58.781]   its wealth, and starting a war with Russia, who has a superior nuclear weapons arsenal,
[00:44:58.781 --> 00:45:05.382]   one has to ask, be it angry mobs or atom bombs, where do these crooks plan on escaping the
[00:45:05.964 --> 00:45:11.588]  Denver is now handing out free bug-out bags to help you just in case you run into emergency.
[00:45:11.668 --> 00:45:16.452]  Lisa, alright, I asked you last time, I need to know the checklist of everything I gotta put in my bug-out bag.
[00:45:17.112 --> 00:45:21.195]  Toilet paper, paper towels, toilet paper, paper towels, we've got cotton balls.
[00:45:21.436 --> 00:45:24.598]  Two opportunities to get these free emergency preparedness bags.
[00:45:24.638 --> 00:45:28.541]  So, really an important effort, especially when we're talking about severe weather.
[00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:37.426]  Yeah, and I know a lot of people are going to go and get those bags, but for people who maybe can't make it out there, is there anything in there that's, you know, too tough that you couldn't just put one of those together yourself?
[00:45:37.846 --> 00:45:40.267]  Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you could easily put together yourself.
[00:45:40.327 --> 00:45:44.109]  I mean, if you got any extra cotton balls, you know, paper towels, toilet paper.
[00:45:44.149 --> 00:45:51.413]  The city of Denver is letting the locals know they should be prepared for an unexpected order to get out of town in a hurry.
[00:45:51.773 --> 00:45:56.696]  And many people are connecting dots between this and the Denver International Airport.
[00:45:57.476 --> 00:46:08.784]  The Denver International Airport has long been rumored to be sitting atop an underground military base built deep beneath the surface and connected to several other underground bases.
[00:46:09.084 --> 00:46:12.307]  These rumors are the result of several interesting facts.
[00:46:13.127 --> 00:46:27.551]  From 1995 until he was found dead a year later, Phil Schneider gave dozens of lectures claiming to be a geological engineer hired to build deep underground military bases known as DUMs for the US government.
[00:46:28.571 --> 00:46:37.134]  His father was Captain Oscar Schneider, a former Nazi stationed in Florida working black operations for naval intelligence.
[00:46:37.954 --> 00:46:42.297]  Phil Schneider was showing samples of what he claimed were unknown exotic metals.
[00:46:42.838 --> 00:46:53.566]  He provided maps of the underground dumps and showed off dramatic scars that he claimed were from a violent skirmish with a non-human species deep underground.
[00:46:54.446 --> 00:47:01.548]  In January of 1996, Schneider was found dead in his home, days after he mysteriously died of strangulation.
[00:47:01.988 --> 00:47:05.469]  Investigations were never completed, and it was ruled a suicide.
[00:47:05.749 --> 00:47:07.249]  His evidence went missing.
[00:47:07.709 --> 00:47:21.533]  Before he died, Phil Schneider used his clearance to take investigative author Alex Christopher into the top underground levels of the Denver Airport, where they took pictures of a long road heading off to multiple destinations.
[00:47:22.313 --> 00:47:31.019]  Built upon 53 square miles of land, 25 miles from downtown, the Denver Airport was billions of dollars over budget.
[00:47:31.419 --> 00:47:39.064]  Different contractors were hired for each section, some of whom have come forward and claimed it would take days to show you what's down there.
[00:47:39.645 --> 00:47:50.592]  Inside the otherwise unimpressive airport, there is a capstone with cryptic Illuminati and Masonic imagery marking a time capsule buried beneath to be opened in 2094.
[00:47:52.513 --> 00:48:04.118]  The airport opened with a famous four-piece mural depicting biological warfare, death and destruction, the surrender of all national sovereignty, and the emergence of a new religion.
[00:48:04.779 --> 00:48:17.624]  On the floor, for no apparent reason, is what appears to be the symbol for gold and silver in a mining cart, AUAG, which is also the abbreviation for a deadly strain of hepatitis discovered in 1965.
[00:48:19.785 --> 00:48:36.782]  Outside on the surface, the runways form the shape of a swastika, and passengers are greeted by what has become known as Blucifer, a 32-foot horse with glowing red eyes that reportedly killed its creator when a piece of the sculpture came loose and severed an artery in his leg.
[00:48:37.623 --> 00:48:41.728]  This is why many people are talking about Denver's bug-out bag program.
[00:48:42.068 --> 00:48:50.979]  Which is good, because now that we know who the people committing these historic crimes against humanity are, we can't just let them slip away into some hole somewhere.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.500]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:26.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, September 27th broadcast.
[00:49:27.007 --> 00:49:32.892]  And Owen Troyer is coming up in studio, your phone calls, a ton of news today as well.
[00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:48.756]   It's very positive that this new Patriot Prime Minister got elected in Italy, but now the Nord Stream 1, not the pipeline they didn't open, like notice the Globalist didn't open, The Keystone Pipeline in the U.S.
[00:49:48.776 --> 00:49:49.417]  when it was completed.
[00:49:49.457 --> 00:49:53.500]  Well, they won't let Russia into Europe open their new pipeline, Nord Stream 2.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:59.084]  Well, Nord Stream 1 is now underwater, probably a submarine, blew it up.
[00:50:00.105 --> 00:50:02.806]  So, you know, massive amounts of gas coming up to the surface.
[00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:05.769]  That is what's going on.
[00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:07.570]  And Biden has come out and threatened.
[00:50:08.731 --> 00:50:09.711]  Well, just hear it for yourself.
[00:50:10.132 --> 00:50:11.893]  Here's what Biden is threatening Russia with.
[00:50:12.827 --> 00:50:14.387]  Let me answer the first question first.
[00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:30.672]  If Germany, if Russia invades, that means tanks or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.
[00:50:31.292 --> 00:50:35.193]  We will bring an end to it.
[00:50:35.353 --> 00:50:36.574]  But how will you do that?
[00:50:39.545 --> 00:50:40.125]  Exactly.
[00:50:40.885 --> 00:50:44.407]  Since the project and control of the project is within Germany's control.
[00:50:45.747 --> 00:50:48.528]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[00:50:52.689 --> 00:50:59.531]  All right, so to be clear, Nord Stream 1 has problems too, but it's Nord Stream 2 they're saying has blown up out in the Black Sea.
[00:51:00.312 --> 00:51:05.333]  Blast detected near Nord Stream months after Biden vowed to end pipeline if Russia invades.
[00:51:05.373 --> 00:51:06.493]  He said that in January.
[00:51:06.854 --> 00:51:07.834]  Here he is in February.
[00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:21.023]  With regard to Nord Stream 2, we continue to have very strong and clear conversations with our German allies, and I want to be clear with you today.
[00:51:21.764 --> 00:51:28.346]  If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.
[00:51:30.587 --> 00:51:32.148]  And now Nord Stream 2 is blown up.
[00:51:32.188 --> 00:51:33.668]  There's problems with Nord Stream 1.
[00:51:34.548 --> 00:51:35.389]  This is war, folks.
[00:51:36.513 --> 00:51:40.175]  And it'll only hurt Europe and bring in the Great Reset and the giant energy crisis.
[00:51:40.575 --> 00:51:51.002]  And then when the global depression kicks off, which has already happened, there's a quantitative easing and all the rest of it, they blame it, ladies and gentlemen, on Russia.
[00:51:51.662 --> 00:51:54.504]  And I'm not saying Russia's perfect, but this is so scripted.
[00:51:54.924 --> 00:52:00.207]  We've got clips of Soros bragging that they overthrew Ukraine eight years ago.
[00:52:00.267 --> 00:52:01.288]  It just goes on and on.
[00:52:02.068 --> 00:52:06.031]  So there's multiple spots that the pipeline has suddenly blown up.
[00:52:07.776 --> 00:52:11.358]  So they send the Navy SEALs in with their submersibles.
[00:52:11.398 --> 00:52:12.558]  They go plant bombs on it.
[00:52:12.578 --> 00:52:13.198]  They blow it up.
[00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:18.101]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[00:52:19.781 --> 00:52:21.782]  Absolutely incredible moment to be alive.
[00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:24.283]  So incredibly dangerous.
[00:52:25.424 --> 00:52:30.526]  If Russia invades, Biden said, Nord Stream 2, one way or another, will end.
[00:52:32.807 --> 00:52:36.589]  And now you see the giant explosion and the gas percolating up.
[00:52:37.455 --> 00:52:38.655]  From the pipeline being cut.
[00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:45.137]  Even if Germany tries to turn it back on under protest and national pressure, the pipeline has been blown up.
[00:52:47.878 --> 00:52:52.660]  Just like Biden killed the Keystone Pipeline.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.661]  Just like they killed hundreds of other major pipelines and thousands of spurs and feeders.
[00:52:59.962 --> 00:53:01.322]  Now their economic war continues.
[00:53:01.362 --> 00:53:08.661]   Just like California is banning electric cars, Freudian slip, just like California is banning gas cars,
[00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:13.800]   trying to force your electric cars that run off a grid that's already overwhelmed and they tell you now
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.662]  you can't even charge your cars.
[00:53:15.662 --> 00:53:22.442]   I wanna play a clip going to break of Tucker Carlson last night talking about the election
[00:53:22.442 --> 00:53:26.162]  of this new Italian prime minister, which is very positive.
[00:53:26.162 --> 00:53:31.401]   The negative news is that the globalists are gonna pull out all the stops
[00:53:31.401 --> 00:53:35.642]   with war and economic collapse and cyber attacks to be blamed on the Russians.
[00:53:35.275 --> 00:53:41.938]  And remember, Putin said, I'll go ahead and cut off Nord Stream 1 if you keep the sanctions going.
[00:53:41.958 --> 00:53:42.758]  They said, no problem.
[00:53:43.198 --> 00:53:46.380]  We'll just blow up Nord Stream 2 so it's not even a debate.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:54.023]  And then they'll still blame Russia for the power outages and the lack of heating going into the fall and winter.
[00:53:55.486 --> 00:53:57.267]  I mean this is globalist terrorism.
[00:53:58.068 --> 00:53:59.729]  This absolutely makes my head spin.
[00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:01.550]  And what a time.
[00:54:02.991 --> 00:54:03.851]  What a time to be alive.
[00:54:03.871 --> 00:54:05.112]  That's why people have got to get prepared.
[00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:06.373]  People have got to get ready.
[00:54:06.853 --> 00:54:10.035]  People have got to get serious because we are not in normal times.
[00:54:10.115 --> 00:54:15.739]  And the average American has lived in freedom so long they have no idea what they're facing and what they're dealing with.
[00:54:16.039 --> 00:54:16.739]  Here's Tucker Carlson.
[00:54:20.194 --> 00:54:22.596]  Our individual freedom is under attack.
[00:54:23.276 --> 00:54:24.797]  Our rights are under attack.
[00:54:25.098 --> 00:54:27.419]  The sovereignty of our nation is under attack.
[00:54:27.659 --> 00:54:30.661]  The prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack.
[00:54:30.862 --> 00:54:33.223]  The education of our children is under attack.
[00:54:33.543 --> 00:54:42.670]  In front of this, people understand that in this age, the only way of being rebels is to preserve what we are.
[00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.653]  The only way of being rebels is to be conservatives.
[00:54:47.788 --> 00:54:54.751]  They will try to take everything away from us, but they can't take away who we are.
[00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:56.792]  And you know what?
[00:54:57.913 --> 00:55:06.417]  Cherishing who we are, knowing what we stand for, is all we need to face this challenge.
[00:55:08.206 --> 00:55:08.946]  She's not kidding.
[00:55:09.767 --> 00:55:13.369]  She's as serious as the moment we are currently living through.
[00:55:14.249 --> 00:55:15.770]  Our rights are under attack, she said.
[00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:18.312]  The sovereignty of our nation is under attack.
[00:55:18.672 --> 00:55:23.735]  And critically, quote, the prosperity and well-being of our families is under attack.
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:25.100]  And that's true.
[00:55:25.161 --> 00:55:26.141]  That's why it's resonant.
[00:55:26.161 --> 00:55:26.962]  Because it's real.
[00:55:27.082 --> 00:55:27.882]  And not just in Italy.
[00:55:27.902 --> 00:55:28.503]  It's true here.
[00:55:29.263 --> 00:55:34.567]  American families are facing the very same onslaught from the very same poisonous ideologies.
[00:55:35.047 --> 00:55:38.349]  The difference is that in this country, it's rarely acknowledged.
[00:55:38.389 --> 00:55:39.270]  Except on the fringes.
[00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.391]  Moni's not on the fringes.
[00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:42.212]  She's the new Prime Minister of Italy.
[00:55:42.252 --> 00:55:42.832]  She will be.
[00:55:43.113 --> 00:55:44.373]  And she's saying it out loud.
[00:55:44.654 --> 00:55:46.475]  Contrast that to what's happening in the United States.
[00:55:46.955 --> 00:55:49.016]  House Republicans just spelled out what they're running on.
[00:55:49.036 --> 00:55:51.058]  It's a document called the Commitment to America.
[00:55:51.578 --> 00:55:52.098]  It's fine.
[00:55:52.399 --> 00:55:53.920]  Probably not much in it you disagree with it.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:55.201]  Have you heard of it?
[00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:57.462]  No, you probably haven't.
[00:55:58.163 --> 00:55:59.103]  You probably haven't read it.
[00:55:59.363 --> 00:56:00.244]  Nobody really cares.
[00:56:00.444 --> 00:56:00.724]  Why?
[00:56:00.744 --> 00:56:02.886]  Because there's nothing real in it.
[00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:08.430]  There's not a single word in that document about the attacks on the American family that you see every day.
[00:56:09.791 --> 00:56:11.432]  That's at the center of most people's concerns.
[00:56:12.232 --> 00:56:12.933]  How are my kids?
[00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.494]  Will they have a life that resembles mine?
[00:56:16.495 --> 00:56:17.556]  That was called the American Dream.
[00:56:17.576 --> 00:56:18.376]  Does it still exist?
[00:56:18.737 --> 00:56:21.559]  Will they be able to afford to live the way they grew up?
[00:56:21.699 --> 00:56:23.260]  Will they have the opportunities that we had?
[00:56:24.574 --> 00:56:24.794]  No!
[00:56:26.135 --> 00:56:27.116]  People are upset about that.
[00:56:27.216 --> 00:56:28.097]  Why wouldn't they be?
[00:56:29.598 --> 00:56:30.459]  But nobody says it.
[00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:40.887]  And that's odd, because we know, and now it's been proven, that when politicians are brave enough to tell the truth about what's actually happening, they tend to be rewarded for it.
[00:56:42.308 --> 00:56:45.410]  Once again, here's the incoming Prime Minister of Italy.
[00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:51.455]  And as you watch this, ask yourself if you would vote for a candidate like this if you had the chance in our country.
[00:56:52.711 --> 00:56:53.952]  Montecio, what are we doing today?
[00:56:53.972 --> 00:56:55.113]  Why is the family an enemy?
[00:56:55.773 --> 00:56:57.214]  Why is the family so scary?
[00:56:58.035 --> 00:57:00.256]  There is a unique answer to all these questions.
[00:57:01.177 --> 00:57:02.017]  Why does it define us?
[00:57:02.037 --> 00:57:03.238]  Why is it our identity?
[00:57:04.199 --> 00:57:13.565]  Because everything that defines us in this time is an enemy, for those who would like us to no longer have an identity and that we were only slaves, perfect consumers.
[00:57:13.785 --> 00:57:25.973]   Chesterton, more than a century ago, let's see if I can find it, Foghi verranno attizzati per dimostrare che 2 più 2 fa 4.
[00:57:27.814 --> 00:57:32.376]  Spade verranno sguainate per dimostrare che le foglie sono verdi in estate.
[00:57:32.956 --> 00:57:34.596]  Quel tempo è arrivato, signori.
[00:57:34.716 --> 00:57:35.477]  Siamo pronti.
[00:57:35.597 --> 00:57:35.997]  Grazie.
[00:57:38.891 --> 00:57:44.792]  So that's the person who's being described all over American television, including on channels that should know better, as quote, far right.
[00:57:45.373 --> 00:57:46.153]  That's far right?
[00:57:46.273 --> 00:57:46.493]  Really?
[00:57:46.533 --> 00:57:50.254]  Because she acknowledges that American families are under attack?
[00:57:50.294 --> 00:57:50.874]  Of course they are.
[00:57:50.894 --> 00:57:51.854]  You think it's accidental?
[00:57:51.934 --> 00:57:52.154]  No.
[00:57:52.614 --> 00:57:53.515]  And she explains why.
[00:57:53.775 --> 00:57:54.355]  And it's simple.
[00:57:54.775 --> 00:58:00.796]  If you want to establish totalitarian control over a country, of course you have to destroy the family first.
[00:58:01.317 --> 00:58:10.319]   Because nobody with deep family loyalty, the one thing every person should have, no one who has that, will ever pledge absolute obedience to a politician.
[00:58:10.439 --> 00:58:11.199]  Why would you?
[00:58:11.819 --> 00:58:14.880]  So if you want absolute obedience, you have to sever family ties.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:24.862]  And that's why state schools brainwash your children with values that you despise and then instruct your children to turn you in as a thought criminal if you object.
[00:58:25.783 --> 00:58:26.463]  That's happening.
[00:58:26.863 --> 00:58:28.023]  It's not your imagination.
[00:58:28.103 --> 00:58:29.403]  And it's happening for a reason.
[00:58:29.944 --> 00:58:31.924]  Wokedness is not just a political ideology.
[00:58:31.944 --> 00:58:35.485]  It's not just something annoying that emerged on college campuses that we can ignore.
[00:58:36.812 --> 00:58:43.436]  It's a state religion that supplants actual religion, which is also being destroyed.
[00:58:43.456 --> 00:58:50.160]  There's a reason the strip bars and the liquor stores and the weed dispensaries stayed open under COVID, but the churches didn't.
[00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:52.041]  If you can't drop...
[00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:58.041]  [Music]
[00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:04.041]   You encourage your audience to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:04.281]  Yes.
[00:59:04.921 --> 00:59:08.383]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[00:59:08.723 --> 00:59:10.563]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:59:10.623 --> 00:59:13.324]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[00:59:13.424 --> 00:59:14.465]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[00:59:14.485 --> 00:59:14.905]  We need money.
[00:59:14.925 --> 00:59:15.425]  All right.
[00:59:16.365 --> 00:59:17.026]  This is it.
[00:59:17.666 --> 00:59:18.566]  Get crypto.
[00:59:18.686 --> 00:59:19.807]  Fund InfoWars.
[00:59:20.607 --> 00:59:23.768]  Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, right?
[00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:26.862]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[00:59:26.882 --> 00:59:28.943]  Your advertisement for a cryptocurrency page.
[00:59:30.204 --> 00:59:34.666]  You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[00:59:34.746 --> 00:59:37.968]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are, they'll give us money before we keep doing it.
[00:59:38.428 --> 00:59:42.330]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep minting money as you're in this courtroom.
[00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:44.831]  All right, let's move on.
[00:59:44.671 --> 00:59:51.671]  And people care about the First Amendment.
[00:59:51.671 --> 00:59:56.671]   And now we head to Connecticut and the second defamation trial of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.445]  I spoke with Alex Jones and he was fired up, ready to testify.
[01:00:01.486 --> 01:00:06.753]  Don't listen to corporate media, don't listen to the establishment, don't listen to Republican, Democrat leaders, don't listen to think tanks.
[01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:08.834]  You want to hear why they fear InfoWars.com?
[01:00:08.854 --> 01:00:10.795]  You want to hear why they fear Alex Jones?
[01:00:10.875 --> 01:00:14.476]  Go to InfoWars.com and actually hear my show.
[01:00:14.936 --> 01:00:15.737]  Watch what we say.
[01:00:16.097 --> 01:00:16.917]  Watch what we do.
[01:00:17.257 --> 01:00:18.178]  See what we really say.
[01:00:18.318 --> 01:00:20.819]  Are you concerned about being held in contempt of court?
[01:00:20.859 --> 01:00:22.520]  We've been covering it on Court TV.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:25.041]  You know, the judge, not happy this morning.
[01:00:25.141 --> 01:00:27.322]  Jones called the judge a tyrant.
[01:00:27.502 --> 01:00:31.764]  This is a travesty of justice and this judge is a tyrant.
[01:00:31.784 --> 01:00:33.725]  You call this judge a tyrant?
[01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:34.285]  Correct.
[01:00:34.685 --> 01:00:34.966]  Yes.
[01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:35.527]  Okay.
[01:00:35.788 --> 01:00:37.792]  And you actually use that word a lot with your audience.
[01:00:37.812 --> 01:00:39.997]  You call people tyrants, don't you?
[01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:40.799]  Only when they act like it.
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.942]  It was wild at times in Connecticut today.
[01:00:44.362 --> 01:00:48.265]  On his first day in the courtroom, Alex Jones did what Alex Jones does.
[01:00:48.465 --> 01:00:49.385]  I didn't progenerate this.
[01:00:49.425 --> 01:00:50.506]  I wasn't the first person to say it.
[01:00:50.987 --> 01:00:54.109]  American governors didn't like being blamed for this, as the left did.
[01:00:54.269 --> 01:00:56.550]  So we rejected it mentally and said it must not be true.
[01:00:56.630 --> 01:00:59.172]  Near the end of the day, the whole thing devolved into chaos.
[01:00:59.392 --> 01:01:01.293]  But I legitimately thought it might have been staged.
[01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:03.555]  And I stand by that, and I don't apologize for it.
[01:01:03.695 --> 01:01:05.036]  And don't apologize, Mr. Jones.
[01:01:05.056 --> 01:01:05.776]  Please don't apologize.
[01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:08.979]  No, I've already apologized to the parents over and over again.
[01:01:09.099 --> 01:01:10.239]  I don't apologize to you.
[01:01:10.259 --> 01:01:11.020]  Don't apologize to you.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:19.686]  Well, Jones talked over his own lawyer's objections all day long, often promoting his website or advertising the products he sells.
[01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:23.369]  And you have a page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right?
[01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:25.711]  Infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[01:01:25.971 --> 01:01:28.313]  Is that a little advertisement just there?
[01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:29.474]  Well, we're fighting the deep state.
[01:01:29.494 --> 01:01:29.874]  We need money.
[01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:30.374]  All right.
[01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:33.056]  He mentioned his products, the ones he pimps.
[01:01:33.577 --> 01:01:35.238]  He mentioned those over and over today.
[01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.680]  You sell a product called BASIC, don't you?
[01:01:39.013 --> 01:01:39.673]  No, Fazzlebee.
[01:01:40.214 --> 01:01:41.074]  Thank you, Fazzlebee.
[01:01:41.855 --> 01:01:44.376]  He kept giving the URL for his website out there.
[01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:47.457]  1776coin.com is the website, right?
[01:01:47.918 --> 01:01:48.218]  Yes.
[01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:51.700]  It's also known as patriotscollectibles.com.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.800]  1776coin.com.
[01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.841]  I felt like I was in the middle of an infomercial.
[01:01:55.422 --> 01:01:57.383]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight.
[01:01:57.743 --> 01:02:00.124]  Check your advertisement for your cryptocurrency page.
[01:02:01.345 --> 01:02:05.747]   You know, I mean, I mean, people want to keep us in the fight.
[01:02:05.827 --> 01:02:09.070]  So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are that give us money before, keep going.
[01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:13.333]  We'll just keep, we'll just keep mincing money as you're in this courtroom.
[01:02:13.373 --> 01:02:15.815]  People care about the First Amendment.
[01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:20.219]  Even during the course of this trial, he's delegitimizing it on his show.
[01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:23.442]  And at the same time, he's selling products on the website.
[01:02:23.642 --> 01:02:25.882]  I felt like I was in the middle of an infomercial.
[01:02:25.882 --> 01:02:35.882]  [Music]
[01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:39.882]   But my favorite Economic Forum speaker of all time is this reptile,
[01:02:39.882 --> 01:02:45.882]  Klaus Schwab's top advisor, Dr. Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:02:46.121 --> 01:02:47.682]  Let's see what he has to say.
[01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:56.784]  Data might enable human elites to do something even more radical than just build digital dictatorships.
[01:02:57.144 --> 01:03:04.026]  By hacking organisms, elites may gain the power to re-engineer the future of life itself.
[01:03:04.446 --> 01:03:08.591]  Because once you can hack something, you can usually also engineer it.
[01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:12.275]  Elites hacking organisms and re-engineering life itself?
[01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.840]  Well, he's not talking about doing that to people, is he?
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:24.370]  Now in the past, many tyrants and governments wanted to do it, but nobody understood biology well enough.
[01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:30.192]  And nobody had enough computing power and data to hack millions of people.
[01:03:30.472 --> 01:03:33.333]  Neither the Gestapo nor the KGB could do it.
[01:03:33.693 --> 01:03:41.576]  But soon, at least some corporations and governments will be able to systematically hack all the people.
[01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:45.838]  I guess he was talking about doing that to people, all people to be specific.
[01:03:46.118 --> 01:04:03.263]  And if indeed we succeed in hacking and engineering life, this will be not just the greatest revolution in the history of humanity, this will be the greatest revolution in biology since the very beginning of life four billion years ago.
[01:04:03.564 --> 01:04:07.525]  For four billion years, nothing fundamental changed.
[01:04:07.665 --> 01:04:08.885]  Not playing God, are you?
[01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:11.006]  Because that usually works out super well.
[01:04:11.326 --> 01:04:17.989]  Science is replacing evolution by natural selection with evolution by intelligent design.
[01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:21.630]  Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds.
[01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:22.930]  Oh, you are playing god.
[01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:24.031]  Say more.
[01:04:24.231 --> 01:04:29.213]  Evolution by natural selection with evolution by intelligent design.
[01:04:29.513 --> 01:04:33.114]  Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds.
[01:04:33.414 --> 01:04:35.375]  But our intelligent design.
[01:04:36.356 --> 01:04:49.652]  Gosh, you wouldn't by chance have a plan in place on how to control people with your cloud technology, would you?
[01:04:49.672 --> 01:04:53.397]  And that plan isn't, by chance, already being implemented.
[01:04:54.017 --> 01:04:54.217]  Is it?
[01:04:54.437 --> 01:04:59.660]  Today, we have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.
[01:04:59.821 --> 01:05:01.602]  Oh, so you could implement it?
[01:05:01.802 --> 01:05:04.804]  In this time of crisis, you have to follow science.
[01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:08.526]  It's often said that you should never allow a good crisis to go to waste.
[01:05:08.546 --> 01:05:09.426]  Sounds familiar.
[01:05:09.446 --> 01:05:12.388]  And I guess you are implementing it already.
[01:05:12.528 --> 01:05:16.671]  Didn't anyone bother telling this guy not to say any of this out loud on camera?
[01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:18.592]  It's... it's just...
[01:05:19.365 --> 01:05:20.804]  It's a lot of evidence.
[01:05:20.804 --> 01:05:28.005]   Surveillance, people could look back in 100 years and identify the coronavirus epidemic
[01:05:28.005 --> 01:05:34.804]   as the moment when a new regime of surveillance took over, especially surveillance.
[01:05:34.814 --> 01:05:35.355]  He's gonna ruin it!
[01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:36.755]  The World Economic Forum.
[01:05:36.775 --> 01:05:38.156]  Out for the good of humanity.
[01:05:38.556 --> 01:05:39.137]  You'll own nothing.
[01:05:39.217 --> 01:05:40.177]  Not even your own DNA.
[01:05:39.997 --> 01:05:44.997]   or to some corporation, or to the government, or perhaps to the human collective.
[01:05:44.997 --> 01:05:47.497]  This guy's revealing the whole plan. He's going to ruin it.
[01:05:47.497 --> 01:05:50.497]  The World Economic Forum, out for the good of humanity.
[01:05:50.497 --> 01:05:54.497]   You'll own nothing, not even your own DNA, if we have our way.
[01:05:54.497 --> 01:06:03.497]   The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this cabinet,
[01:06:03.497 --> 01:06:06.497]  are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[01:06:06.721 --> 01:06:12.063]  So if we penetrate the cabinet, the change is not just happening.
[01:06:13.104 --> 01:06:16.925]  The change can be shaped by us.
[01:06:17.646 --> 01:06:20.107]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[01:06:20.587 --> 01:06:21.507]  How to prepare?
[01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:24.829]  To take the necessary action to create a fairer world.
[01:06:27.954 --> 01:06:29.655]  I see the need for a great reset.
[01:06:30.396 --> 01:06:37.481]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:40.684]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[01:06:41.124 --> 01:06:42.025]  It will not happen.
[01:06:42.525 --> 01:06:46.108]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[01:06:46.908 --> 01:06:49.991]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:06:50.571 --> 01:06:52.753]  Pay insufficient attention.
[01:06:53.613 --> 01:07:08.521]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:07:10.342 --> 01:07:22.342]   The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:38.342]  [Music]
[01:07:38.342 --> 01:07:45.342]   Alright, we got a bit of an emergency relief situation going on here.
[01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:47.437]  Alex had to step away.
[01:07:48.818 --> 01:07:51.880]  Let's call it a legal emergency he needed to deal with.
[01:07:52.381 --> 01:08:01.788]  Everything's fine, but he's in the middle of court cases right now, bankruptcy cases, so it's a miracle we can even get him on air half the time with everything he's dealing with.
[01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:03.130]  So he's had to step away.
[01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:04.551]  I'm coming in emergency relief.
[01:08:04.711 --> 01:08:09.615]  Haven't even had a chance to throw a couple warm-up pitches, so we're just coming in hot out of the gate.
[01:08:09.635 --> 01:08:17.514]   So what I'm going to do Is take phone calls for the rest of this hour and into the next.
[01:08:19.256 --> 01:08:21.357]  And the number to call in is 877-789-2539.
[01:08:21.377 --> 01:08:28.103]  877-789-2539, but you already knew that.
[01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:30.484]  And we'll go ahead and just do open lines.
[01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:33.387]  Anything you want to talk about is fair game.
[01:08:33.567 --> 01:08:54.793]   Now, there's a couple things I'm was really kind of looking into and that's the Major situation developing in Ukraine and how the entire situation has been misrepresented from the very start by the mainstream media and by our politicians.
[01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:56.134]  Go figure, they're lying to you again.
[01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:26.358]   But the World Economic Forum has already put the West into a position of dependence And then ultimately, shutting the energy off, and now we're not fully there, but the whole thing has been laid out, they run a couple more operations, and then it's lights out.
[01:09:28.478 --> 01:09:42.644]   So, America and Europe have already been put in this position by the World Economic Forum, to have their energy shut off, and to have their food controlled, And their travel, and their diet, and just everything.
[01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:51.510]  And they're public about this, because they're getting ready to actually, you know, lower the drawbridge and let the tyrants in, to run it all.
[01:09:54.412 --> 01:10:13.329]   And now, on top of that, you have Russia, and China, and Iran, and India, and Brazil, and Mexico, and Japan, and Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, and UAE, and Qatar, And they're not really into that.
[01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:28.058]  And it's almost as if they're now planning the post-first world in response to the post-industrial world that the World Economic Forum is implementing in the West.
[01:10:28.939 --> 01:10:47.306]   And so now Putin with India and China and the Middle East and other countries have positioned themselves that when the West collapses They're going to have everything ready to go for them to now be the dominant power force and for them to now be the example of first world countries.
[01:10:48.947 --> 01:10:49.927]  That's what they're doing.
[01:10:50.707 --> 01:10:55.908]  And the situation in Ukraine is kind of the linchpin in the entire deal.
[01:10:58.469 --> 01:11:05.831]  Because if the West can secure Ukraine, Russia has a lot less influence on Europe and the flow of energy.
[01:11:07.212 --> 01:11:30.813]   And if Russia Can secure Ukraine, then it pretty much lights out for Europe and Russia will have total energy dominance in Europe and in the East and then you and I, we've already been set up to be turned off and then we won't even have an option.
[01:11:34.475 --> 01:11:37.377]  So the situation is very serious in Ukraine.
[01:11:39.639 --> 01:11:40.880]  And you hope it doesn't get any worse.
[01:11:44.264 --> 01:11:57.459]  But then there's the issue of, we've got so many problems here domestically, it's almost impossible to even properly deal with the international concern right now.
[01:11:59.693 --> 01:12:19.529]  We've got a Democrat party that is openly hostile against its own citizens, and using, weaponizing all the factions of government that they possibly can, all the facets of big corporations that they possibly can, against their political opposition, against any dissent, and you've seen how bad it is now.
[01:12:21.351 --> 01:12:22.692]  I mean, what is the worst case?
[01:12:22.952 --> 01:12:24.674]  I guess them outright murdering people?
[01:12:26.192 --> 01:12:28.875]  Them showing up with guns to assassinate Republicans?
[01:12:29.616 --> 01:12:32.419]  Like what's happened in Portland and Denver and Washington D.C.
[01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:33.100]  multiple times.
[01:12:35.883 --> 01:12:37.464]  In front of Justice Kavanaugh's house.
[01:12:37.765 --> 01:12:38.565]  You know all the stories.
[01:12:39.967 --> 01:12:41.368]  They've got their political prisoners.
[01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:55.522]  They do guns drawn raids of innocent people like that pastor with seven kids, his kids are home, they get an FBI guns drawn raid on him, even though the judge had already thrown out the case.
[01:12:56.382 --> 01:13:01.367]  A judge looked once at the case, said this is an entirely fabricated case, threw it out.
[01:13:03.488 --> 01:13:17.523]   And still the FBI, oh not only that, not only did the judge that originally saw the case threw it out because it was frivolous, The FBI still contacted the pastor, and he even told them he'd be willing to cooperate.
[01:13:17.983 --> 01:13:18.903]  But it wasn't enough.
[01:13:19.384 --> 01:13:22.345]  They still had to do a guns drawn raid on him.
[01:13:27.048 --> 01:13:30.390]  So, we've got evil on a world level.
[01:13:31.551 --> 01:13:33.252]  We've got evil on a national level.
[01:13:35.836 --> 01:13:39.099]  And it's hard to really try to figure out which is a bigger deal.
[01:13:39.199 --> 01:13:41.601]  Now, America could be independent.
[01:13:42.121 --> 01:13:44.744]  That's the way this country was designed, you see.
[01:13:45.785 --> 01:13:47.246]  With the individual being strong.
[01:13:48.327 --> 01:13:54.132]  And the concept of self-government encouraging the individual to be independent and strong.
[01:13:55.673 --> 01:13:56.934]  And smart and informed.
[01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:00.557]  But we've gone so far from that now.
[01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:02.539]  America's so dependent on China.
[01:14:03.937 --> 01:14:21.242]  And now that Biden and the Democrats have shut off our energy and the World Economic Forum has made that official policy, not only are we completely dependent on other countries, but also on the big corporations.
[01:14:23.143 --> 01:14:27.924]  So America has been put into a position of total surrender by Joe Biden and the globalists.
[01:14:30.665 --> 01:15:02.687]   And now, I guess they have just, the globalists, have either already put it on the card that they're going to have a war with Russia, or they underestimated Russia's resistance to this, that would then ultimately lead to a greater resistance, or it's all just a big game being played by the central banks and they're all in on it.
[01:15:04.005 --> 01:15:08.489]  And we're probably going to have to witness the bloodiest century in human history.
[01:15:11.772 --> 01:15:12.572]  So that's where we're at.
[01:15:13.813 --> 01:15:28.326]  And it's amazing that America's been put in this position and that we haven't learned from our own history, we haven't learned from world history, and people willingly, ignorantly, just completely sold their birthright.
[01:15:28.786 --> 01:15:32.209]  Just sold it out for a cheap trick.
[01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:37.730]  Completely sold out their birthright for a cheap trick.
[01:15:39.131 --> 01:15:44.735]  And now you've got all these young kids running around talking about being communists and wanting to take your guns.
[01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:47.296]  And it's just, wow!
[01:15:49.598 --> 01:15:56.262]  And you sit back and you ask God, what is the answer to this?
[01:15:57.203 --> 01:15:58.804]  Do we really have to deal with this forever?
[01:16:00.441 --> 01:16:02.982]  And he just realizes, yeah, this is God's design.
[01:16:03.002 --> 01:16:05.063]  There's good, there's evil, and we all have a choice.
[01:16:08.884 --> 01:16:11.025]  So, that's where it's at.
[01:16:11.926 --> 01:16:15.887]  That's me stepping right in out of the bullpen and throwing 99 miles per hour.
[01:16:15.907 --> 01:16:18.348]  I might have hit a few batters, might have knocked a guy out, hit him in the head.
[01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:23.570]  But it's all good, because we got out of the inning, and we're going to be taking your phone calls on the other side.
[01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:25.391]  Folks, remember, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:26.513 --> 01:16:28.635]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:16:28.695 --> 01:16:29.315]  Get that book.
[01:16:29.375 --> 01:16:30.797]  The Madman Alex Jones.
[01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:31.797]  Still signing copies.
[01:16:32.398 --> 01:16:33.999]  He's going completely mad at this point.
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.781]  I don't know how he's not going to get carpal tunnel.
[01:16:37.322 --> 01:16:38.463]  The supplements are all great.
[01:16:38.483 --> 01:16:40.424]  Survival Shield X2 on sale.
[01:16:40.444 --> 01:16:42.586]  Survival Shield X3, very important.
[01:16:42.646 --> 01:16:49.532]  You see in Poland and other countries, they're giving their citizens iodine because it's a good way to detoxify from radiation.
[01:16:49.552 --> 01:16:52.674]  Well, I'm not selling it as an emergency supplement.
[01:16:53.175 --> 01:16:54.436]  You need iodine.
[01:16:54.796 --> 01:16:56.798]  Most people are deficient in iodine.
[01:16:56.818 --> 01:16:58.739]  That's why we sell it at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:58.799 --> 01:16:59.040]  All right.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.904]  Your calls on the other side up till the fourth hour when Jay Dyer takes over today on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:17:05.965 --> 01:17:06.185]  Woo!
[01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:10.009]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:17:10.029 --> 01:17:14.652]  If you're tuned into this transmission, that means you're a red-blooded American.
[01:17:16.294 --> 01:17:17.735]  And it's in your blood.
[01:17:18.215 --> 01:17:21.298]  It's in your DNA to fight tyranny.
[01:17:23.578 --> 01:17:27.200]  That's why the globalists fear you so much.
[01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:30.823]  And they gotta hit you with a poison vaccine.
[01:17:31.443 --> 01:17:33.244]  And they gotta hit you with their internet censorship.
[01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:34.925]  And they gotta hit you with their glyphosates.
[01:17:35.285 --> 01:17:36.666]  They gotta hit you with the GMO.
[01:17:36.686 --> 01:17:38.868]  They gotta hit you with the fluoride.
[01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:41.870]  Because you're strong.
[01:17:43.631 --> 01:17:44.611]  And you have a destiny.
[01:17:48.674 --> 01:17:57.795]   And that's why this transmission, the mothership, of all red-blooded patriots communications right here
[01:17:57.795 --> 01:18:01.295]  is their number one target for destruction.
[01:18:01.295 --> 01:18:08.045]   And so we go out to the great audience that they want to silence. It's not just us, it's not just the
[01:18:08.045 --> 01:18:09.295]  crew, it's not just the host here.
[01:18:09.295 --> 01:18:13.295]   It's also you in the audience they want silenced.
[01:18:13.295 --> 01:18:15.295]  So we give you a voice.
[01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:18.795]  And we start with Julian in Indiana.
[01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:21.295]  Julian, you're on the Alex Jones Show. Go ahead.
[01:18:21.795 --> 01:18:30.795]   Yes, sir. I saw a post on the internet that Ray F. White, Robin F.,
[01:18:30.795 --> 01:18:39.795]   was a director of sales for Dominion Enterprise, which is a division of Dominion Voting.
[01:18:39.674 --> 01:18:42.818]  That would explain a lot to me, if that's true.
[01:18:44.281 --> 01:18:54.189]  Well, I don't have any information on that, but what I do know is that Ray Epps appears to be the linchpin of the entire January 6th narrative and the Fed's involvement.
[01:18:54.989 --> 01:19:00.774]  And you had Thomas Massey, I think it was at hearings either yesterday or Friday, but I have some clips I'm going to play in the war room later.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:08.907]  And Thomas Massey brings up Ray Epps and Jamie Raskin, who's on the January 6th committee, says, I have no idea who Ray Epps is.
[01:19:09.027 --> 01:19:09.968]  I don't know anything.
[01:19:10.448 --> 01:19:14.372]  And then later he's like, oh, Ray Epps, oh, he's just a poor schmuck caught up in all of this.
[01:19:14.412 --> 01:19:15.113]  He's innocent.
[01:19:16.095 --> 01:19:16.735]  Just incredible.
[01:19:17.075 --> 01:19:32.462]  They all know who Ray Epps is, they're all covering up the truth about Ray Epps, and it's really just incredible to sit here and witness this like some sort of bad magician that tells you he's making a bunny rabbit disappear or something, but you see it behind his back.
[01:19:32.502 --> 01:19:36.504]  I mean, that's how ridiculous, that's how ludicrous this whole January 6th thing is.
[01:19:38.605 --> 01:19:39.145]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:39.745 --> 01:19:40.986]  The truth's gotta be known.
[01:19:41.626 --> 01:19:43.307]  We gotta have the truth.
[01:19:44.514 --> 01:19:48.239]  Well, I don't know what Republicans need to have teeth and a bite here.
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:50.302]  Because they definitely have some bark.
[01:19:50.522 --> 01:19:51.363]  There's a little bit of bark.
[01:19:51.623 --> 01:19:53.286]  There's some bark coming from the Republican Party.
[01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:55.869]  I mean, they're putting some of these Democrats right to task.
[01:19:56.664 --> 01:20:06.289]  I mean, I look at Josh Howley, I look at Thomas Massey, I look at Rand Paul, I look at Ted Cruz, I look at Jim Jordan, I look at Matt Gaetz, I look at Paul Gosar, I look at Marjorie Taylor Greene, I look at Lauren Boebert.
[01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:13.393]  Those are some that I think are doing, you know, good things with their bark, but I'd like to see some bite.
[01:20:14.153 --> 01:20:15.154]  Julian, thanks for the call.
[01:20:15.914 --> 01:20:18.635]  Let's go to Jordan in New Jersey.
[01:20:18.695 --> 01:20:20.036]  Jordan, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.056 --> 01:20:20.396]  Go ahead.
[01:20:21.837 --> 01:20:22.357]  Hi, Owen.
[01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:24.398]  Hope all is well.
[01:20:26.431 --> 01:20:34.095]  So I just wanted to connect the dots here on some of these executive orders that Biden's issued and what's coming.
[01:20:34.575 --> 01:20:36.055]  I mentioned this to Alex a couple weeks ago.
[01:20:36.075 --> 01:20:40.137]  I was on with Harrison Smith this morning with the same thing.
[01:20:40.157 --> 01:20:50.002]  And it's very important that people understand this and understand kind of the implications of this as we're going through this upheaval, which is all part of it, right?
[01:20:50.898 --> 01:21:00.585]  So, specifically, Biden issued an executive order in March concerning digital assets, what he called digital assets.
[01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:04.368]  So, cryptocurrency, or an NFT, I guess.
[01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.489]  Correct.
[01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:07.791]  Yeah, precisely.
[01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:09.672]  And it was Executive Order 14067.
[01:21:10.413 --> 01:21:14.996]  And then recently, he issued another executive order.
[01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:25.095]  Which is the Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy.
[01:21:25.435 --> 01:21:27.957]  Oh, that's how you know they're screwing you when they have to tell you how great it is.
[01:21:28.697 --> 01:21:34.801]  Yeah, and it sounds like, you know, Emperor Palpatine or something, you know, making a speech about how safe and secure things are going to be.
[01:21:35.282 --> 01:21:53.942]   So, what I want to do is tell everybody that it's coordinated by the same group, and this all ties into Biden's second executive, well, is the National Security Memorandum that he issued after just being in office, you know, a couple of days, really, or maybe a couple of weeks.
[01:21:55.343 --> 01:21:57.064]  The first one he issued was on cybersecurity.
[01:21:57.104 --> 01:21:59.826]  The second one he issued, National Security Memorandum No.
[01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:05.250]  2 for him, which completely revamped the National Security Council.
[01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:09.593]  And there are unprecedented changes in here that he did.
[01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:34.987]  And most specifically, when you look at both of the executive orders, what he did in that national security memorandum and centralizes power and added new positions that were never seen before in government and basically created a system whereby this cryptocurrency effort by him as well as this biotechnology effort has all been centralized in the White House, in the national security apparatus.
[01:22:35.827 --> 01:22:49.873]  There's a great blog on this from a Washington insider, John B. Bellinger III, partner to International Security Law Practices at Arnold and Porter in Washington, that goes through it and talks about the implications of what National Security Memorandum 2 is.
[01:22:50.573 --> 01:23:04.303]   And these two executive orders are joined, if you look in the coordination section of both the text of the orders, You will see that these assistants and so forth are spearheading all of these efforts, one of whom is Brian Deese.
[01:23:04.704 --> 01:23:06.925]  He's spearheading both, okay?
[01:23:07.385 --> 01:23:25.098]  And Brian Deese, who's been on and has been pilloried by the likes of you and Alex and so forth, and Gerald Salente, as well as Jake Sullivan, who is involved here too, are all mentioned in there as the people who have the authority to oversee all this.
[01:23:25.678 --> 01:23:40.781]  Now, I believe that this is all co-joined into the social credit score system that they're trying to bring in and what you're talking about is happening in Ukraine and the chaos that they're unleashing here domestically and so forth is to bring everybody into this new system.
[01:23:41.361 --> 01:23:44.865]  Well, sure, and that's what Alex has talked about as part of the Great Reset.
[01:23:45.386 --> 01:23:54.675]  They want the world in the kind of Chinese-style social credit score, but really even worse, with more control over just everything you do.
[01:23:54.715 --> 01:23:59.821]  Just you're fully plugged into the hive mind or the AI or whatever they call it all the time.
[01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:03.445]  But they'll sell it as trendy and people will just eat it up.
[01:24:04.482 --> 01:24:10.188]  You know, as far as what you're talking about with Biden and the executive orders, the Democrats are involved in all kinds of shenanigans behind the scenes.
[01:24:10.669 --> 01:24:12.070]  Government is constantly expanding.
[01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:16.756]  Politicians are constantly writing new laws, expanding it, hiring their friends at new positions.
[01:24:18.061 --> 01:24:20.682]  And it just, it just, it always happens.
[01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:27.503]  But the Democrats are trying to get rid of the, basically the safeguards of the Electoral College right now.
[01:24:27.783 --> 01:24:30.864]  They're trying to get rid of the filibuster right now.
[01:24:31.224 --> 01:24:37.026]  They're trying to get rid of laws so that they can just make illegal immigrant citizens so that they can vote in the next election right now.
[01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:40.707]  So, I mean, there's just an all-out assault on the laws of this country.
[01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:44.628]  There's a total assault on the foundation of this country, and it's all coming from the Democrat Party.
[01:24:45.028 --> 01:24:45.848]  Everybody knows that.
[01:24:46.688 --> 01:25:06.778]  And I'm sick of the Democrats having their cake and eating it too, when 50% of the time they're bashing America, how bad it is, how racist it is, how capitalism has failed, and all the other things, and oh, it started in 1619 actually, and oh, you know, Columbus was bad, and Amerigo Vespucci shouldn't have named it at all, and all this crap.
[01:25:07.398 --> 01:25:14.360]  And then the other 50% they're telling you how they're saving America and how Republicans are a threat to the democracy and a threat to the country and all this stuff.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:16.741]  It's like, just pick one, Democrats.
[01:25:16.781 --> 01:25:17.842]  Just pick one, Liberals.
[01:25:18.342 --> 01:25:20.082]  Do you love America or do you hate America?
[01:25:20.122 --> 01:25:21.223]  You can't have it both ways.
[01:25:21.243 --> 01:25:21.963]  We all know the truth.
[01:25:21.983 --> 01:25:22.763]  You hate this place.
[01:25:23.263 --> 01:25:24.784]  Why don't you just frickin' leave?
[01:25:25.644 --> 01:25:27.545]  Because you know there's nowhere better else to go.
[01:25:28.699 --> 01:25:29.680]  And, you know what?
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.082]  That might not even be it as much as, you just want to tell us how to live our lives.
[01:25:34.803 --> 01:25:35.723]  That's really what it is.
[01:25:36.604 --> 01:25:38.585]  They just want to tell you how to live your life.
[01:25:41.306 --> 01:25:43.768]  I'll go to phone calls when we come back from this break, but you know...
[01:25:45.219 --> 01:25:48.322]  We really are at an incredible time in this country's history.
[01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:51.905]  I mean, for me, there's never been anything like this.
[01:25:52.545 --> 01:25:57.149]  It's like a Yankees fan and a Red Sox fan or an Ohio State fan and a Michigan fan.
[01:25:57.829 --> 01:26:02.053]  I mean, we are so on opposite sides of the spectrum right now.
[01:26:03.394 --> 01:26:05.236]  We're in two completely different worlds.
[01:26:06.557 --> 01:26:08.858]  Forget whatever you know is fact or whatever I know is fact.
[01:26:09.699 --> 01:26:14.143]  I live in a completely different reality than liberals.
[01:26:15.610 --> 01:26:18.734]  We are in a completely different reality.
[01:26:21.418 --> 01:26:23.020]  They think Hillary Clinton is a saint.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.082]  We think Hillary Clinton is a demon.
[01:26:26.844 --> 01:26:28.887]  We think Donald Trump was a great president.
[01:26:28.927 --> 01:26:30.329]  They think Donald Trump is a demon.
[01:26:32.853 --> 01:26:35.434]  Now, why can't we just have an amicable split?
[01:26:35.555 --> 01:26:40.217]  Why can't we just say, you go your way, we go our way, and find a way to have an amicable split here?
[01:26:41.118 --> 01:26:54.545]  I bet you most Republicans would actually support the idea or the conversation, but no Democrats would, no Liberals would, because at the end of the day, they're Socialists, they're Communists, they're Totalitarians, they're Authoritarians, and they need your compliance.
[01:26:55.746 --> 01:26:59.208]  What do they have if they don't have your compliance?
[01:26:59.568 --> 01:27:00.829]  They have nothing.
[01:27:02.332 --> 01:27:04.494]  They have nothing without your compliance.
[01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:06.855]  And so there'll never be a separation.
[01:27:07.996 --> 01:27:10.198]  There'll never be an amicable split.
[01:27:10.798 --> 01:27:21.767]  They always will need to be there telling you what to do, how to live your life, how to raise your children, what to eat, how to sleep, where to live, how to travel.
[01:27:23.248 --> 01:27:24.029]  They're not liberals.
[01:27:24.729 --> 01:27:25.910]  They're totalitarians.
[01:27:26.409 --> 01:27:31.409]   and they're missing the bigger picture of the New World Order pushing them into this trap.
[01:27:31.409 --> 01:27:46.409]  [Music]
[01:27:46.409 --> 01:27:54.409]   The best-selling book in America last week was "The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds" written by Alex Jones.
[01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:58.486]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[01:27:58.566 --> 01:28:01.448]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[01:28:01.748 --> 01:28:06.091]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[01:28:06.512 --> 01:28:11.375]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons of mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[01:28:11.635 --> 01:28:12.436]  So they lied about his book.
[01:28:13.479 --> 01:28:15.520]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:20.783]  The historic book that lays out the plans of the Great Reset Death Star.
[01:28:21.363 --> 01:28:25.565]  And exposes the New World Order's plans for global enslavement.
[01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:31.568]  Get your copy now at Amazon.com to keep the book at number one.
[01:28:32.028 --> 01:28:36.030]  And InfoWarsTore.com to help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:40.532]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:28:41.072 --> 01:28:42.553]  Now number one in the world.
[01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:50.545]  Man, I'm just looking at the news that I'm going to be covering on The War Room coming up here.
[01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:57.250]  And we are just accelerating right now into the future.
[01:28:59.372 --> 01:29:00.893]  And it's not the future that we want.
[01:29:03.074 --> 01:29:04.215]  It's not the future that we want.
[01:29:04.255 --> 01:29:05.296]  But we're not dead yet.
[01:29:06.577 --> 01:29:07.498]  We're not finished yet.
[01:29:08.498 --> 01:29:11.881]  The globalists don't have us eating the bugs and living in the pods.
[01:29:13.581 --> 01:29:15.742]  Living in the darkness yet, we're not there yet.
[01:29:17.363 --> 01:29:18.403]  We can still see the light.
[01:29:19.524 --> 01:29:20.944]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[01:29:21.965 --> 01:29:24.786]  Let's go to Steve in Virginia.
[01:29:25.286 --> 01:29:27.727]  Steve, you're on the Alex Jones Show, go ahead.
[01:29:29.408 --> 01:29:32.949]  Hey Owen, long time listener, first time caller.
[01:29:33.289 --> 01:29:33.750]  Right on.
[01:29:35.450 --> 01:29:40.312]  Been following you guys for a while and it's great to see how everything's gone.
[01:29:42.501 --> 01:29:46.084]  I just wanted to talk about, I just had a question.
[01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:47.685]  You said it's open, right?
[01:29:48.226 --> 01:29:50.087]  Sure.
[01:29:50.788 --> 01:30:00.076]  I just want to know why, or what's the connection to Saturn and, you know, the cube and the hexagon on the North Pole of Saturn?
[01:30:02.015 --> 01:30:06.997]  It's connection to occult worship for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:30:07.878 --> 01:30:22.644]  Well, you know, I'm not the big astrology guy here, and I've studied a little bit about the occultisms and symbologies, but I'm probably not enough informed to comment on that.
[01:30:22.684 --> 01:30:30.480]   What I will say though, looks like somebody in the crew knows what's going on, you know, I really almost don't even want to comment.
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:31.661]  This is like a trap call.
[01:30:32.521 --> 01:30:34.062]  You know, this is one of those trap calls.
[01:30:34.523 --> 01:30:40.266]  Because... You know, I'll just, I'll put it like this.
[01:30:40.886 --> 01:30:42.908]  I don't trust a damn thing out of NASA.
[01:30:43.248 --> 01:30:44.228]  Let me just put it that way.
[01:30:44.308 --> 01:30:45.889]  I don't trust a damn thing out of NASA.
[01:30:45.909 --> 01:30:48.651]  So if you're pulling up an image from NASA, I don't trust it.
[01:30:48.971 --> 01:30:50.192]  They admit their stuff is fake.
[01:30:51.752 --> 01:31:00.935]  I mean, I don't want to go too far off onto a jag here, but I mean, there's videos of these astronauts, and it doesn't make sense what they're doing.
[01:31:02.176 --> 01:31:04.456]  But okay, there's the hexagon on Saturn.
[01:31:05.477 --> 01:31:17.481]  What's odd, if you want to talk about space, they've got the new James Webb telescope that's getting more detailed images than even the Hubble, and now they're claiming like all the planets have rings around them.
[01:31:17.501 --> 01:31:23.679]   I think they said that I think they have Uranus now with a ring around it and maybe even Jupiter with a ring around it too.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:30.502]  And if you were lucky enough last night, you had an incredible sight in the sky.
[01:31:30.822 --> 01:31:34.584]  We had a clear night here in Austin and Jupiter was, I mean it was like chilling.
[01:31:34.864 --> 01:31:36.805]  Did anybody in the crew see Jupiter last night by the way?
[01:31:38.226 --> 01:31:38.966]  I sure hope so.
[01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:47.070]  We had a beautiful, clear night sky here last night, and Jupiter was the closest it's been to Earth in like a thousand years or something, the closest it'll be in another thousand years.
[01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:49.951]  I mean, you could almost see the crescent.
[01:31:50.952 --> 01:31:55.354]  That's how big and bright it was, that you could almost see the crescent.
[01:31:56.454 --> 01:32:07.439]  Because when you see these planets, I used to be into telescopes, they look big and bright, and you think it's a round thing, but when you actually look at it, they're usually just crescents, kind of like a crescent moon.
[01:32:08.797 --> 01:32:16.962]  But you could almost, it was so big and bright, you could almost see the crescent, and like, the glimmer and the sparkle off the crescent.
[01:32:18.103 --> 01:32:27.009]  It truly was a magnificent thing, and I'm sitting out there watching this, and I'm just sitting there thinking, wow, nobody realizes what an amazing sight.
[01:32:27.069 --> 01:32:34.634]  It's just right up in the sky right now, and everybody's sitting in their houses watching television, missing out on this just incredible sight.
[01:32:35.034 --> 01:32:36.275]  So did you see that, Steve?
[01:32:36.315 --> 01:32:37.456]  Did you see Jupiter last night?
[01:32:38.644 --> 01:32:39.625]  I live in Virginia.
[01:32:39.645 --> 01:32:41.647]  I didn't see that last night.
[01:32:41.667 --> 01:32:41.987]  I guess.
[01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:43.806]  Is Jupiter banned in Virginia?
[01:32:43.806 --> 01:32:44.806]  I didn't know that.
[01:32:44.806 --> 01:32:46.166]  (laughing)
[01:32:46.166 --> 01:32:47.006]  Those bastards.
[01:32:47.006 --> 01:32:48.766]  I didn't look it up, yeah.
[01:32:48.766 --> 01:32:49.605]  How dare they?
[01:32:49.605 --> 01:32:54.926]   Yeah, but I had a question about, you know how the vortex inside the hexagon
[01:32:54.926 --> 01:32:56.126]  goes counterclockwise?
[01:32:56.126 --> 01:32:57.206]  I told you.
[01:32:57.737 --> 01:32:59.719]  I don't know about the hexagon!
[01:33:00.239 --> 01:33:00.840]  It's crazy!
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:02.281]  Yeah, that stuff's nuts, man.
[01:33:02.861 --> 01:33:04.062]  I don't know, that's a great question.
[01:33:04.242 --> 01:33:13.969]  Well, I'll tell you this, Steve, I might have to go down a rabbit hole and look into that, because I don't know about the hexagon or the counterclockwise spinning on Saturn, but that's definitely curious stuff.
[01:33:13.989 --> 01:33:15.570]  But I know Jupiter was awesome last night.
[01:33:16.831 --> 01:33:18.773]  You know, sometimes I feel like I'm on Jupiter.
[01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:22.090]  Spiraling through space.
[01:33:24.392 --> 01:33:26.554]  Alright, we're taking calls from our great audience here.
[01:33:27.575 --> 01:33:34.341]  And, you know, we really do love you, we really do appreciate you, we really do view you as just as much a part of this as we are.
[01:33:35.635 --> 01:33:40.738]  And you going out making The Great Reset and The War for the World by Alex Jones a top seller has been so key.
[01:33:41.298 --> 01:33:47.061]  You going out and telling friends and family about the transmission and sharing the band links has been so key.
[01:33:47.781 --> 01:33:51.723]  And it's always great when we open up the phone lines and get to hear directly from you.
[01:33:52.323 --> 01:33:54.144]  Let's go to Old Dude.
[01:33:54.645 --> 01:33:56.185]  Old Dude in Missouri.
[01:33:56.205 --> 01:33:57.386]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:57.406 --> 01:33:57.766]  Go ahead.
[01:33:58.747 --> 01:33:59.467]  Hey, what's up Owen?
[01:33:59.507 --> 01:34:00.187]  How you doing, man?
[01:34:00.207 --> 01:34:00.648]  Alright, good.
[01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:01.208]  Thanks for calling.
[01:34:02.199 --> 01:34:13.090]  Hey, so the issue that we have right now is that people can't grasp fundamental reality, and a big part of that is that people have lost sight of the significance of what we have in documented human history.
[01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:25.464]   Okay, so you've got the theory of evolution that proposes that there's a gap of essentially 4.5 billion years between creation And the beginning of documented human history.
[01:34:25.745 --> 01:34:34.167]  And when you do that, you really dilute the significance of what has happened in the less than 50 million hours of documented history.
[01:34:35.167 --> 01:34:40.048]  95% plus of that has been recorded since Christ came and lived and ascended.
[01:34:40.608 --> 01:34:40.948]  Okay?
[01:34:41.168 --> 01:34:49.150]  And that's less than 20 million hours that we have, but 4.5 billion years of history, and there's this perceived gap.
[01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:52.311]  Like, that really throws people off in their perception of what is.
[01:34:53.214 --> 01:35:05.598]  And God has put it on my heart that until the people recognize the foundation of reality and unify there and pursue right standing with God's standard, the dissent will continue.
[01:35:06.158 --> 01:35:08.179]  You know, you don't sound like an old dude.
[01:35:08.399 --> 01:35:09.439]  I've got to call you out.
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  You do not sound...
[01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:14.310]  Owen, Owen, it's old dude.
[01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:17.311]  I ain't old, I'm old dude, because I'm just any old dude.
[01:35:17.831 --> 01:35:18.131]  Old dude.
[01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:18.451]  Old dude.
[01:35:18.571 --> 01:35:19.091]  Oh, okay.
[01:35:19.211 --> 01:35:20.271]  Yeah, yeah, oh well.
[01:35:20.451 --> 01:35:22.892]  Hey, and you guys should go and check your email archives.
[01:35:22.932 --> 01:35:30.773]  I've been sending you guys emails for a minute because God put it on my heart to write a book to prove the reality of God, because words will do that.
[01:35:31.033 --> 01:35:38.554]  Like the word truth and the word reality, those hold a weight and an energy and an essence that you can't really measure, but you feel it, right?
[01:35:38.574 --> 01:35:44.427]   Well, you know, there's almost, see, but there's an element It all ties into the bigger picture.
[01:35:45.148 --> 01:35:50.151]  Because the element of laziness is always the evil against mankind.
[01:35:51.051 --> 01:35:55.954]  People like just accepting evolution as how we got here.
[01:35:56.094 --> 01:36:07.701]  It's a lazy way of ignoring real human history and the mysteries of human history that maybe are being kept secret from us or maybe we don't fully understand yet.
[01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:19.939]   And to then just discount what Pretty much humanity used to fundamentally understand as a fact, divine creation, that something created all of this, is also lazy.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.627]  And so, there's always an element of laziness that's evil against mankind.
[01:36:27.762 --> 01:36:31.646]  But when you talk about the shortness of it, I mean, I just feel like we're accelerating.
[01:36:31.687 --> 01:36:36.392]  I mean, we can see where the technology is taking us, and it's going to be inevitable.
[01:36:36.712 --> 01:36:42.219]  The question is whether it's going to be used to uplift humanity or oppress humanity.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:43.880]  Right.
[01:36:45.771 --> 01:36:56.133]  With what I have said, will you guys please go check your email archives, and I want to extend an offer to Alex that you can sell the hard copies of this book that I've written exclusively.
[01:36:56.473 --> 01:36:59.314]  You'll know it's the real deal within 10 pages, okay?
[01:36:59.734 --> 01:37:09.256]  That way it can get out there, because if people can't grasp fundamental reality, then we can't flip the script on the globalists and say, hey, now we got the ball in our court.
[01:37:09.276 --> 01:37:12.157]  And isn't that why, isn't that why, what's the name of your book?
[01:37:13.266 --> 01:37:14.467]  It's called, Why Christ?
[01:37:14.667 --> 01:37:15.768]  The truth is true.
[01:37:16.088 --> 01:37:17.328]  Doubt is invalid.
[01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:28.875]  So, and thank you for the call, but this is why in the books 1984 and Brave New World, there's always the, there has to be human oppression.
[01:37:28.895 --> 01:37:32.537]  There has to be the human being oppressed for the tyranny to succeed.
[01:37:33.558 --> 01:37:47.785]   And when you talk about the fundamental reality, The Italian Prime Minister, the first female Prime Minister, did you see any big puff pieces about her for women's rights, shattering the glass ceiling for women, women leadership?
[01:37:47.805 --> 01:37:48.625]  Did you see any of that?
[01:37:48.685 --> 01:37:51.666]  No, you didn't, because it's only the women that do the liberal agenda.
[01:37:51.706 --> 01:37:54.806]  They actually don't care about women, they just care about using women for their agenda.
[01:37:56.046 --> 01:37:59.887]  And that's totally proven with the victory for the new Italian Prime Minister.
[01:38:00.087 --> 01:38:10.739]   But in one of her speeches, she says, we now understand And if the crew can pull it up because I'm going to have to paraphrase here.
[01:38:10.999 --> 01:38:20.647]  She says, we now understand as a people that we're going to have to take up sword and shield to battle for basic facts like 4 plus 4 or 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:38:21.107 --> 01:38:23.870]  Basic facts like a man is a man and a woman is a woman.
[01:38:24.250 --> 01:38:27.813]  Basic facts like children's innocence and they need to be protected.
[01:38:29.694 --> 01:38:36.099]  She said, we now understand we have to take up sword and shield to fight for basic realities now.
[01:38:37.168 --> 01:38:37.708]  And she's right.
[01:38:37.748 --> 01:38:38.949]  We understand that now.
[01:38:39.029 --> 01:38:40.830]  This is the crazy time that we live in.
[01:38:42.251 --> 01:38:44.273]  Alright, let's go from one old to the next.
[01:38:44.593 --> 01:38:46.614]  Old Saxon in Texas.
[01:38:46.794 --> 01:38:48.436]  Old Saxon, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:48.816]  Go ahead.
[01:38:49.636 --> 01:38:50.297]  Hey, Owen.
[01:38:50.337 --> 01:38:50.877]  Howdy, man.
[01:38:50.937 --> 01:38:52.378]  Thanks a lot for taking my call.
[01:38:52.518 --> 01:38:53.059]  Thanks for calling.
[01:38:53.079 --> 01:38:54.420]  In Jesus' name.
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:59.823]  Hey, I just thought the viewers should know about a video clip on YouTube.
[01:39:00.624 --> 01:39:01.404]  They can look it up.
[01:39:01.564 --> 01:39:06.187]  Cynthia McKinney, an ex-Congresswoman, U.S.
[01:39:06.247 --> 01:39:06.948]  Congresswoman.
[01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:16.291]  Speaking on Press TV in 2013, and she goes into some interesting detail about... Is that Dinecore?
[01:39:16.391 --> 01:39:17.372]  Is that the Dinecore one?
[01:39:19.052 --> 01:39:54.472]   It's about a 20-minute clip, but the part that I'm calling in about starts about five minutes into the clip, and she starts to explain about the lobbies in Washington, D.C., how that she says 435 From the House to the 100 from the Senate, 535 of our congressmen and women are all basically signed a pledge to AIPAC and take money and that they all have to agree on certain points.
[01:39:55.693 --> 01:40:03.828]   And so, you know, when it comes to the weak Republicans and the pedophiles and the demons, Nobody's speaking up.
[01:40:03.807 --> 01:40:04.807]  Why don't they speak up?
[01:40:04.807 --> 01:40:09.207]   Well, wasn't it Cynthia McKinney that also, I think that's the clip that they have up
[01:40:09.207 --> 01:40:14.007]   right there on the screen now, when she was talking about DynCorp getting government contracts
[01:40:14.007 --> 01:40:16.368]  and doing human trafficking.
[01:40:16.368 --> 01:40:19.007]  Cynthia McKinney was one of the true last great Democrats.
[01:40:19.007 --> 01:40:21.927]  She's one of the last good Democrats to be in Congress.
[01:40:21.927 --> 01:40:23.646]  Tulsi Gabbard no longer in Congress anymore.
[01:40:23.646 --> 01:40:26.327]  I don't know if there's any left.
[01:40:26.327 --> 01:40:28.967]  Kirsten Sinema probably the last one that's even close.
[01:40:28.967 --> 01:40:32.327]   Yeah, Cynthia McKinney, she called out a bunch of good stuff.
[01:40:32.327 --> 01:40:36.328]   A lot of great clips from Cynthia McKinney that you can go back and watch.
[01:40:36.129 --> 01:40:39.130]  So I'm glad you remind us of her time in Congress.
[01:40:39.551 --> 01:40:40.331]  Thank you for the call.
[01:40:40.811 --> 01:40:43.753]  Let's go to Andrew in New York.
[01:40:43.973 --> 01:40:45.254]  Andrew, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:45.294 --> 01:40:45.634]  Go ahead.
[01:40:46.994 --> 01:40:47.415]  What's up?
[01:40:47.515 --> 01:40:49.656]  I wanted to talk about Jeremy Brown.
[01:40:49.716 --> 01:40:53.498]  He's the prisoner from the January 6th setup.
[01:40:53.778 --> 01:40:54.818]  Yes, the veteran.
[01:40:55.799 --> 01:41:01.662]  Yeah, he has a podcast while he's in jail and he's also running for office.
[01:41:03.064 --> 01:41:10.510]  So, I kind of think that's pretty good proof that Trump is in control of the military.
[01:41:10.530 --> 01:41:12.812]  Even Jeremy Brown is part of the military.
[01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:23.241]  Look, I don't want to put people's dreams out here, and I'm not trying to act like I know everything, but the Q stuff, it's just none of it's real.
[01:41:23.281 --> 01:41:24.301]  I just don't know what to tell you.
[01:41:24.381 --> 01:41:25.582]  Trump is not the president.
[01:41:25.683 --> 01:41:27.224]  He's not in control of the military.
[01:41:27.504 --> 01:41:29.806]  I'm just not going to tell you something that's not happening.
[01:41:30.404 --> 01:41:33.508]  Well, why would, why would Biden let Jeremy Barron run?
[01:41:33.548 --> 01:41:36.792]  Like, they don't even let, like, people who aren't... See, and here's the other thing, too, like...
[01:41:37.944 --> 01:41:42.786]  I could respond to what you're asking me right now with stuff that only I know, but it's not appropriate to take to air.
[01:41:43.066 --> 01:41:43.346]  Okay?
[01:41:43.526 --> 01:41:45.227]  So, I'm just, I'm just, I'm not going to do it.
[01:41:45.807 --> 01:41:48.289]  January 6th, what they're saying is obviously a huge lie.
[01:41:48.829 --> 01:41:54.972]  It's not, they killed Ashley Babbitt, they killed three others that day, only Trump supporters died, they lied about the police officers, we all know that.
[01:41:55.332 --> 01:41:57.413]  Ray Epps is the linchpin that'll pull the whole thing down.
[01:41:57.793 --> 01:42:00.254]  We'll see if Republicans want to keep tugging on that loose thread or not.
[01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:06.057]  But I'm not going to talk to you about Trump being in control of everything because it's just not true.
[01:42:06.317 --> 01:42:06.958]  It's just not true.
[01:42:07.558 --> 01:42:08.959]  I'm sorry to give you that news.
[01:42:09.559 --> 01:42:11.160]  Let's go to David in Wyoming.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:12.321]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:12.601 --> 01:42:13.782]  You know what, David, we've got to take a break.
[01:42:13.802 --> 01:42:14.662]  I just looked at the clock.
[01:42:15.563 --> 01:42:21.486]  So we're going to take a short break here and we will be back in four minutes taking your calls the rest of the hour.
[01:42:21.946 --> 01:42:23.147]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:23.167 --> 01:42:24.428]  If you want to keep it on the air, folks.
[01:42:24.668 --> 01:42:31.450]  If you want to keep this show on the air, go to InfoWarsStore.com or SaveInfoWars.com right now in this break.
[01:42:32.151 --> 01:42:36.472]  All these great callers, their voices will be gone too, not just Alex's.
[01:42:36.552 --> 01:42:37.052]  Remember that.
[01:42:37.892 --> 01:42:40.873]  You know, folks, I wish Trump was in control.
[01:42:41.194 --> 01:42:47.256]  I wish he had a bunch of white hats running things and patriots were in control, as they say, or he had some grand plan to save this country.
[01:42:47.376 --> 01:42:49.076]  I just have no evidence of that.
[01:42:53.823 --> 01:43:02.229]  Why do you think throughout the entire January 6th Committee questioning and hearings they haven't brought up QAnon one time?
[01:43:04.571 --> 01:43:06.593]  Why do you think they don't want to investigate Ray Epps?
[01:43:08.014 --> 01:43:08.894]  The answer is the same.
[01:43:12.397 --> 01:43:16.640]  Now, we are taking your phone calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:17.721 --> 01:43:19.802]  Remember folks, don't take InfoWars for granted.
[01:43:21.384 --> 01:43:22.905]  The Long Knives are out for us.
[01:43:24.503 --> 01:43:25.203]  And you.
[01:43:26.384 --> 01:43:28.525]  But InfoWars is always the test case.
[01:43:28.645 --> 01:43:40.149]  And so if they can successfully do harm to free speech in any way they can, they then take that methodology and use it against their other enemies and opposition.
[01:43:40.789 --> 01:43:43.670]  So InfoWars staying on air and being victorious in all this is key.
[01:43:44.091 --> 01:43:48.872]  That's why we need your support at InfoWarsStore.com and SaveInfoWars.com.
[01:43:50.453 --> 01:43:52.794]  Let's go to Mark in Florida.
[01:43:52.835 --> 01:43:54.796]  Boy, we said open lines and we meant it.
[01:43:55.296 --> 01:44:00.339]  I've got callers on the line that want to go back to the Saturn issue, as if I didn't embarrass myself on that one.
[01:44:00.959 --> 01:44:03.081]  Mark in Florida, though, you're on the line.
[01:44:03.161 --> 01:44:03.601]  Go ahead.
[01:44:04.582 --> 01:44:04.782]  Hi.
[01:44:05.382 --> 01:44:08.444]  I want to very easily clear up the creation issue.
[01:44:09.905 --> 01:44:13.487]  We have hair that never stops growing, and that cannot be evolutionary.
[01:44:13.667 --> 01:44:14.768]  It's just a simple fact.
[01:44:15.068 --> 01:44:19.891]  Imagine a monkey in the jungle with a 25 foot length of hair behind him.
[01:44:20.598 --> 01:44:24.059]  He doesn't know that he has to cut that hair and he gets stuck in the forest and he dies.
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:28.101]  There are only two animals on the entire planet that have this problem.
[01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:29.442]  Hair that never stops growing.
[01:44:29.862 --> 01:44:32.383]  The sheep, the Lamb of God, and men.
[01:44:32.983 --> 01:44:34.264]  Okay, so we were created.
[01:44:34.604 --> 01:44:37.005]  There's nothing evolutionary about us.
[01:44:37.265 --> 01:44:38.085]  That's a big mystery.
[01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:39.025]  Who created us?
[01:44:39.105 --> 01:44:39.886]  That's a big mystery.
[01:44:39.946 --> 01:44:41.006]  In any case, another thing.
[01:44:41.266 --> 01:44:47.829]  You're telling me that you can't go into the jungle and find a gorilla with long flowing hair?
[01:44:48.621 --> 01:44:49.063]  That's it.
[01:44:49.243 --> 01:44:50.688]  That's exactly it.
[01:44:50.829 --> 01:44:51.130]  Wow.
[01:44:51.190 --> 01:44:52.836]  Well, I'm calling the journey off then.
[01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:54.442]  I'm calling the exhibition next week off.
[01:44:57.128 --> 01:45:05.012]  In any case, this is a particularity about our species, and it's anti-evolutionary, and all people who are geneticists and scientists, etc., they know about this.
[01:45:05.313 --> 01:45:09.115]  They know that this is a huge problem, but they just shut up about it.
[01:45:09.155 --> 01:45:11.016]  They don't want to talk about it, because it's so obvious.
[01:45:11.816 --> 01:45:18.420]  And another thing is... So let's even just take it one step further, or one step backward, actually.
[01:45:20.509 --> 01:45:32.077]  What's even more obvious is that there is divine creation, like there is a soul, like there's something else, there's something magical and mystical about this consciousness, about this life experience.
[01:45:32.097 --> 01:45:33.898]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:45:34.518 --> 01:45:35.459]  Well, yeah, you get the point.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:45.886]  It's absolutely obvious, and except the people who basically know this, they have this feeling inside them, but they somehow rebel against it.
[01:45:46.724 --> 01:45:49.165]  In any case... It's like, but where would you rather live?
[01:45:49.185 --> 01:45:55.527]  And that's why they love abortion so much, because it's their act of defiance against the value of life.
[01:45:55.627 --> 01:46:01.609]  It's their act of defiance against life being a divine existence, against it being something special.
[01:46:01.649 --> 01:46:02.790]  That's their act of defiance.
[01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:04.650]  If you kill life, it doesn't bother you at all.
[01:46:06.211 --> 01:46:07.871]  Who would even want to live in that world?
[01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:11.513]  Like, who would want to live with that evil mindset towards this?
[01:46:11.533 --> 01:46:11.973]  Absolutely.
[01:46:12.393 --> 01:46:12.973]  Absolutely.
[01:46:13.274 --> 01:46:17.175]  In the Hebrew script, we are promised eternal life on this world.
[01:46:17.496 --> 01:46:20.077]  Adam and Eve were eternal.
[01:46:20.557 --> 01:46:25.700]  However, not because of their operation, but because of a divine gift.
[01:46:28.141 --> 01:46:28.441]  Okay?
[01:46:28.561 --> 01:46:29.241]  They lost that.
[01:46:29.362 --> 01:46:31.563]  They lost that because of themselves.
[01:46:32.763 --> 01:46:34.744]  The mortality was lost by us.
[01:46:36.665 --> 01:46:49.482]   The symbolism in all of it is crazy, and that's when you realize That the Satanists, the Luciferians, who want to trick you into not believing in God or the Bible, they believe in it more than anybody else.
[01:46:50.162 --> 01:46:59.226]  And that's the great irony of all of this, with their symbolism everywhere, with the apple being bitten for apple, with Paramount and the 22 stars above the mountain.
[01:46:59.566 --> 01:47:08.469]  It's literally all biblical symbology with all biblical meanings, and then when you apply that knowledge, you can see again, you can feel again.
[01:47:10.464 --> 01:47:26.261]  Like you wouldn't believe, when they discover the math, the mathematics that Ariel Cohan O'Loro has released, he proves, he proves to the Satanists with Hebrew math, that their Satan, their Lucifer, in the end it's the Messiah.
[01:47:26.882 --> 01:47:29.385]  They're not going to be able to not worship God.
[01:47:30.103 --> 01:47:35.965]  They're not going to be allowed by religious mathematics, by Kabbalah, by Hebrew tradition.
[01:47:36.565 --> 01:47:40.307]  All these Satanists, all these people who believe in Lucifer, they're going to discover it's Jesus.
[01:47:42.607 --> 01:47:43.308]  All right, Mark.
[01:47:43.348 --> 01:47:45.008]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:47:45.749 --> 01:47:49.030]  And then you notice the big Pharma logo.
[01:47:49.630 --> 01:47:53.451]  Pharmaceutical logo is the same logo of Baphomet.
[01:47:54.131 --> 01:47:55.192]  I'm sure that's just a coincidence.
[01:47:55.432 --> 01:47:56.752]  Let's go to Kyle in New Jersey.
[01:47:56.792 --> 01:47:57.933]  Kyle, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:57.953 --> 01:47:58.293]  Go ahead.
[01:48:00.592 --> 01:48:01.653]  Hey, how's it going, Owen?
[01:48:02.174 --> 01:48:02.614]  Howdy, good.
[01:48:02.654 --> 01:48:04.556]  Thanks for calling.
[01:48:04.576 --> 01:48:05.938]  A couple points to make here.
[01:48:07.119 --> 01:48:07.880]  Just one second here.
[01:48:07.900 --> 01:48:10.563]  A couple points.
[01:48:11.323 --> 01:48:19.352]  And they kind of tie together with the issue that the previous caller had just brought up and the one who discussed about Saturn.
[01:48:20.373 --> 01:48:22.195]  And just bear with me on this.
[01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:33.336]  So what the previous caller just said is so relevant about Jesus Christ being the true Messiah, but this ties in with what Alex brought up at the beginning of the broadcast about the root of the Great Reset.
[01:48:34.096 --> 01:48:41.380]  Well, the real true root you have to go back to and read the founder of the modern state of Israel, David Ben-Gurion.
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:45.682]  And he says that we will build a shrine of the prophets in Jerusalem.
[01:48:46.142 --> 01:48:50.725]  There will be a one true United Nations and a council headed out of Jerusalem.
[01:48:51.576 --> 01:48:56.517]  This is his quote, and basically it lays out, it's called, On Imagining the Future, David Ben-Gurion.
[01:48:57.097 --> 01:49:13.061]  Now, the hexagon on Saturn coalesces, it's a six-sided, you know, figure, and it coalesces with the Star of David, which is also a six-sided figure, and it's coincidental with the Mark of the Beast.
[01:49:14.022 --> 01:49:16.902]  So there's no question that it's all tied together.
[01:49:17.282 --> 01:49:19.223]  It's not the Jews, it's the Zionist Jews.
[01:49:20.298 --> 01:49:22.240]  He talks about the Hebrew mouth, the previous caller.
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:23.420]  He's exactly right.
[01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:27.043]  The Kabbalah, all this mysticism and the Satanism.
[01:49:27.383 --> 01:49:32.147]  And it really goes back to this war between Jesus Christ and the sons of Cain.
[01:49:32.847 --> 01:49:42.814]  As Jesus said, basically, that all righteous blood from Abel up until now and going forward will be on this generation.
[01:49:43.595 --> 01:49:48.258]  And he's talking about these Luciferian Canaanites, which call themselves Zionists.
[01:49:49.516 --> 01:49:57.322]  So really, it comes out of Zion, and David Ben-Gurion, the founder of Israel and the first Prime Minister, said it best.
[01:49:57.362 --> 01:50:03.067]  He said, we will have a one true United Nations headed in Jerusalem, an international court to settle all disputes.
[01:50:03.608 --> 01:50:04.208]  You can look it up.
[01:50:04.268 --> 01:50:06.610]  Google David Ben-Gurion on imagining the future.
[01:50:06.990 --> 01:50:08.372]  That's really all I wanted to say.
[01:50:08.672 --> 01:50:08.912]  Thanks.
[01:50:10.774 --> 01:50:11.254]  All right.
[01:50:11.454 --> 01:50:12.095]  I'll tell you what.
[01:50:12.395 --> 01:50:13.676]  I'll go back to Saturn.
[01:50:13.736 --> 01:50:16.599]  Josh in Florida, you got 60 seconds to tell me about Saturn.
[01:50:16.619 --> 01:50:16.859]  Here we go.
[01:50:19.346 --> 01:50:20.106]  You got me, Owen?
[01:50:20.126 --> 01:50:20.727]  Oh yeah.
[01:50:22.128 --> 01:50:22.668]  Alright, alright.
[01:50:22.788 --> 01:50:25.950]  So the last two callers had it pretty much on point.
[01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:29.011]  The beginning was the fallen angel Michael.
[01:50:29.191 --> 01:50:30.332]  He was Lucifer.
[01:50:31.072 --> 01:50:38.376]  And he taught his descendants, you know, the elite today, that, you know, do it this way.
[01:50:38.416 --> 01:50:39.137]  That's the right way.
[01:50:39.317 --> 01:50:40.598]  Obviously it's not the right way.
[01:50:40.758 --> 01:50:42.379]  Obviously nature and God's the right way.
[01:50:42.699 --> 01:50:46.741]  The cube is the allspark, the tesseract.
[01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:51.660]   It's to keep your mind In the cube, don't think outside the box.
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.921]  You know what I mean?
[01:50:55.841 --> 01:50:57.121]  I'll tell you this much.
[01:50:57.121 --> 01:51:02.541]   It's a symmetrical symbol they use to keep the population dumb, basically.
[01:51:02.541 --> 01:51:10.501]   We're all going into the internet and we're now all so reliant on the internet
[01:51:10.501 --> 01:51:15.820]   that if the net internet web, worldwide web was ever shut off,
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:20.560]   we'd be trapped and we wouldn't know what to do with ourselves.
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:24.520]   So there's big developing news right now on the Nord Stream pipelines,
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:32.920]   perhaps being attacked, if not just collapsing, perhaps even attacked.
[01:51:33.223 --> 01:51:37.227]  And so now the game of whodunit will begin.
[01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:41.572]  And it could be blamed on Russia.
[01:51:43.092 --> 01:51:45.333]  But I don't understand what Russia's motive would be.
[01:51:45.373 --> 01:51:47.795]  They already control the flow of those pipelines.
[01:51:48.035 --> 01:51:50.836]  What purpose would they have in destroying them?
[01:51:53.418 --> 01:51:54.498]  Could it be the U.S.
[01:51:54.558 --> 01:51:55.339]  to blame Russia?
[01:51:56.079 --> 01:51:58.000]  Could there be another actor involved here?
[01:52:01.122 --> 01:52:03.103]  These details are developing.
[01:52:03.323 --> 01:52:26.252]   It's just, as I was explaining when I first started in relief of Alex today, We were already slated for deindustrialization and collapse and now it looks like the East is just going to accelerate that and say this is what you chose.
[01:52:29.092 --> 01:52:51.514]   Which almost disenfranchises the World Economic Forum and the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates of the world other than the fact that Bill Control you as you're basically a new western peasant living off crickets and in the pod like the World Economic Forum wants you to.
[01:52:53.116 --> 01:52:53.898]  So that's developing.
[01:52:56.039 --> 01:53:02.183]  And when I sign off here at two o'clock, I'll go be doing the prep work for the War Room and we'll have more on that coming up.
[01:53:02.803 --> 01:53:04.964]  But we go back to the phone lines now.
[01:53:06.125 --> 01:53:09.027]  And we go to Todd in Illinois.
[01:53:09.087 --> 01:53:10.908]  Todd, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:10.948 --> 01:53:11.228]  Go ahead.
[01:53:12.449 --> 01:53:13.029]  Hey, Owen.
[01:53:13.089 --> 01:53:13.970]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.510]  It's an honor.
[01:53:14.530 --> 01:53:16.171]  I've been listening to you guys since September of 2000.
[01:53:17.038 --> 01:53:26.944]  Um, basically what I wanted to say today was, uh, ever since Biden's little speech, his double speech, um, I've kind of seen how, I just see how things are going to play out.
[01:53:26.964 --> 01:53:35.349]  They're going to play with the next, uh, Russia, I think is going to try and hold out until our midterm before they actually go and use nukes or anything, hoping that will fix our country.
[01:53:36.062 --> 01:53:38.644]  Um, but they're going to try and steal the midterm, obviously.
[01:53:39.044 --> 01:53:45.348]  But it's going to be such a landslide, there'll be so much trouble, you know, they won't be able to, you know, people are basically start rioting.
[01:53:45.588 --> 01:53:51.572]  Everything that's happening in Europe is going to happen here in America where people are rioting and uprising because they're not going to go along with their steal.
[01:53:52.053 --> 01:53:58.457]  So I personally see them then trying to assassinate Biden because he's too much of a liability.
[01:53:59.017 --> 01:54:22.372]   Blaming it on Trump supporters and trying to ring Trump into it and you know arrest Trump as you know Conspiracy to commit via his rhetoric kind of like they're doing to Alex now with the whole Sandy Hook thing So and then then if that doesn't work, then they'll blow up one of our cities and blame it on Russia Well, let me just scale it back and respond to the midterms thing.
[01:54:22.432 --> 01:54:32.899]  Sometimes I have this approach towards current events, news topics, as I'm thinking, you know, okay, well, how am I going to cover this, or what do I think is really going on here?
[01:54:33.459 --> 01:54:44.094]   And I kind of have to weigh all the facts, weigh all the angles, and sometimes they all look They all have kind of an equal value in my mind.
[01:54:44.174 --> 01:54:45.775]  And so I have this alternative approach.
[01:54:45.815 --> 01:54:47.376]  I call it the first pitch approach.
[01:54:47.876 --> 01:54:48.876]  It's a baseball analogy.
[01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:53.238]  Sometimes you just decide you're swinging at the first pitch and you're thinking it's going to be a fastball.
[01:54:53.678 --> 01:54:58.820]  So sometimes when I kind of have that stalemate intellectually, I take a swing at the first pitch approach.
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:03.201]   And so somebody asks me, What do you think is going to happen at the midterms?
[01:55:03.562 --> 01:55:06.962]  Instead of thinking about it, I take the swing at first pitch approach, and I have to agree.
[01:55:07.482 --> 01:55:10.243]  I don't see the Democrats letting these midterm elections go.
[01:55:10.883 --> 01:55:12.623]  I see there being total theft.
[01:55:13.244 --> 01:55:22.906]  I think the Democrats take the House and the Senate and have more power than any political party has ever had in this country, and they will use it more so than we've even seen.
[01:55:23.326 --> 01:55:26.226]  You think the political abuse by the Democrats is bad now?
[01:55:26.706 --> 01:55:33.272]   Wait till what happens if they steal the midterms, because It's even bigger than the popularity for Trump.
[01:55:34.713 --> 01:55:41.676]  I think there'll be a lot of local elections and races where people will push back, people will demand investigations.
[01:55:42.256 --> 01:55:50.760]  There's going to be so much videotape of the drop boxes and the polling locations, it's going to be so obvious that they're cheating.
[01:55:54.150 --> 01:56:08.319]  I don't know if they could ever pull off something like they did in 2020 with Trump, and then in the Georgia special elections, and I think they did it in a couple more, so maybe they will, where Trump is winning in five states at three o'clock in the morning, and then they just give the perfect amount of votes for Joe Biden and just declare for Joe.
[01:56:09.340 --> 01:56:21.868]  I don't know if they could do something that aggressive again, but I think people are going to say, you know, this is awfully odd, how all these Democrats keep getting in office, yet I don't know one person that supports them.
[01:56:25.635 --> 01:56:27.236]  So that's kind of my first pitch approach.
[01:56:27.416 --> 01:56:28.817]  I think the Democrats steal the midterms.
[01:56:29.818 --> 01:56:30.158]  Big.
[01:56:30.979 --> 01:56:31.219]  Big.
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:39.364]  All things being equal, I think that if you're swinging first pitch, what's your just gut reaction, gut response, they're gonna steal it.
[01:56:39.704 --> 01:56:42.846]  They're gonna steal it as obvious as they have ever done it.
[01:56:43.507 --> 01:56:44.527]  Why wouldn't they, folks?
[01:56:44.587 --> 01:56:47.089]  Look at how completely out of control and rogue they are.
[01:56:48.450 --> 01:56:49.050]  Let's go to...
[01:56:51.846 --> 01:56:53.788]  Fernando in South Carolina.
[01:56:53.828 --> 01:56:55.149]  Fernando, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:55.169 --> 01:56:55.549]  Go ahead.
[01:56:56.370 --> 01:56:57.671]  It's a pleasure to speak with you, Owen.
[01:56:58.211 --> 01:56:58.892]  Hey, thanks for calling.
[01:56:59.532 --> 01:57:02.455]  Alright, so I've got three important points right now, if I can make them.
[01:57:03.856 --> 01:57:24.233]   I started a grassroots movement where we're partnering with local farmers in Florida and South Carolina, and we're trying to buy up the land to keep it against, you know, as a hedge of protection against people like Bill Gates, the World Economic Forum, I mean, are we going to forget Bill Gates' poop water?
[01:57:26.074 --> 01:57:36.460]  Yeah, now he's got the new corn, he's got his new synthetic corn, he's got his bio milk, he's got the fake milk, he's got the fake meat, and he's buying up all the farmland.
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:40.443]  And he says he wants to get the human population down to zero.
[01:57:40.723 --> 01:57:41.063]  So, yeah.
[01:57:42.045 --> 01:57:51.975]  Yeah, so before I make point number two, uh, it's at GibsonGo.com slash Our Land, or, uh, uh, Gab, uh, it's 1776 Our Land.
[01:57:52.795 --> 01:58:01.664]  Now, point number two is I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for Superman Vitality and, um, Alpha Power, because I wouldn't have followed through with this.
[01:58:02.485 --> 01:58:06.689]  But when they're out of stock, Primal Youth is available at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:58:07.712 --> 01:58:13.075]  You don't want to be like Biden's Department of Energy guy, Sam Brinton, okay?
[01:58:13.916 --> 01:58:16.938]  You don't want to be like Bruce Kaitlin gendered.
[01:58:19.879 --> 01:58:20.960]  I remember you mentioned that.
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:24.102]  Yeah, that was in the Supermail Vitality ad.
[01:58:24.122 --> 01:58:25.122]  Yeah.
[01:58:25.923 --> 01:58:29.405]  And number three, here's a challenge to the InfoWars audience, alright?
[01:58:30.171 --> 01:58:38.957]  If 100,000 patriots, red-blooded Americans, donate $100 to SaveInfoWars.com, we can do so much damage to the deep state.
[01:58:39.297 --> 01:58:40.118]  This is our call.
[01:58:40.398 --> 01:58:41.099]  We're in the fight.
[01:58:41.379 --> 01:58:41.939]  God bless you.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:44.001]  Thank you, Fernando.
[01:58:44.221 --> 01:58:45.542]  Thank you so much for that call.
[01:58:46.202 --> 01:58:49.284]  Let's go now to... Let's see who's been on the longest.
[01:58:49.665 --> 01:58:50.986]  That'd be Brian in Texas.
[01:58:51.026 --> 01:58:52.166]  Brian, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:52.186 --> 01:58:52.527]  Go ahead.
[01:58:52.547 --> 01:58:55.068]  Hi, Owen.
[01:58:56.129 --> 01:59:10.595]   I had a topic in mind, but listening to These other topics, it just leads to the obvious in that we need to take control of our destiny in politics.
[01:59:12.657 --> 01:59:23.327]  I think it's come time to not look at the likelihood or the uphill battles of it, but we need to have our own political party.
[01:59:23.999 --> 01:59:27.520]  That grows through the bright minds of yourself, Alex Jones.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.181]  Alex isn't prime.
[01:59:29.201 --> 01:59:30.781]  We need to take advantage of that.
[01:59:31.942 --> 01:59:34.723]  Yeah, there's really not enough time, unfortunately.
[01:59:34.803 --> 01:59:35.923]  There's not enough time for that.
[01:59:36.404 --> 01:59:38.524]  And look, Andrew Yang is starting this new third party.
[01:59:38.544 --> 01:59:45.747]  That's a good thing for Republicans, if we trust our election results anyway, because that's just going to take away from the Democrat Party more than anything.
[01:59:46.822 --> 01:59:49.003]  But I mean, I understand where you're coming from.
[01:59:49.043 --> 01:59:50.903]  If we had time, that'd be a good solution.
[01:59:51.163 --> 01:59:52.763]  I don't think we have that much time.
[01:59:52.803 --> 01:59:53.563]  That would take years.
[01:59:53.784 --> 01:59:57.024]  It would take years to develop, decades even, to develop a third party.
[01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:59.165]  How about the idea of this?
[01:59:59.245 --> 02:00:01.025]  We let God be the judge of time.
[02:00:01.145 --> 02:00:11.347]  And maybe God has a plan to destroy what we see is so terrible and what we cannot even, that we're fearful of conquering.
[02:00:12.047 --> 02:00:14.988]  If that is conquered, then it could be our time.
[02:00:15.481 --> 02:00:27.711]  But I think we hold a really strong chance, because the inevitable is we're slapping our so-called brand name on these so-called Republicans.
[02:00:27.831 --> 02:00:36.318]  Like you said, Donald Trump was a great president, and I'm aligned with you 100%, but I know that you don't feel he's a great president in comparison.
[02:00:36.338 --> 02:00:37.419]  Donald Trump is not the answer.
[02:00:37.639 --> 02:00:41.002]  I think a mass awakening, a mass awakening is the answer.
[02:00:41.042 --> 02:00:44.105]  But you notice that people are talking more about God and creation again.
[02:00:44.875 --> 02:00:47.157]  All right, final segment for me, Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:00:47.177 --> 02:00:54.943]  I'll be back hosting the War Room with all the latest breaking news, including the huge development right now with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, folks.
[02:00:55.764 --> 02:01:03.710]  This is the next big puzzle piece to drop in that scenario, that situation with Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S.
[02:01:05.276 --> 02:01:08.760]  And so we're closely monitoring that, but I'm going to finish up with these phone calls.
[02:01:09.401 --> 02:01:11.083]  David, I didn't mean to leave you holding there.
[02:01:11.183 --> 02:01:14.868]  The clock reset when I accidentally put you on, so I apologize for that.
[02:01:15.068 --> 02:01:16.610]  David, you're on the Alex Jones Show now.
[02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:17.030]  Go ahead.
[02:01:17.631 --> 02:01:18.372]  Yeah, are you there?
[02:01:19.073 --> 02:01:19.914]  Oh yeah, we got you now.
[02:01:20.635 --> 02:01:21.336]  Okay, good.
[02:01:21.736 --> 02:01:22.917]  Happy anniversary, by the way.
[02:01:22.937 --> 02:01:23.758]  I heard you yesterday.
[02:01:23.798 --> 02:01:24.339]  Five years.
[02:01:24.519 --> 02:01:24.880]  Cool, dude.
[02:01:26.124 --> 02:01:27.985]  Yeah, I don't know the exact date.
[02:01:28.006 --> 02:01:31.308]  I think the first war room was like September 15th, 2017.
[02:01:31.688 --> 02:01:36.332]  But the point is, we're proud of how far we've come.
[02:01:36.392 --> 02:01:38.614]  That's thanks to the audience, thanks to the crew, all of us together.
[02:01:39.334 --> 02:01:40.255]  Well, thanks to you.
[02:01:40.275 --> 02:01:42.417]  I called in because I wanted to get this out.
[02:01:42.437 --> 02:01:50.943]  I don't know how you guys missed this, but Steny Howard was on and admitted on the House floor on the 15th of this year, September 15th.
[02:01:52.481 --> 02:01:53.602]  There is a deep state.
[02:01:53.802 --> 02:01:55.543]  Can your crew pull that up?
[02:01:56.063 --> 02:01:59.265]  You just need to put in Steny Hoyer, the deep state that comes up.
[02:02:00.286 --> 02:02:01.987]  Steny Hoyer, deep state?
[02:02:02.747 --> 02:02:03.708]  Yep.
[02:02:05.809 --> 02:02:07.951]  I'm not sure if I've seen that or not, but we'll look into that.
[02:02:08.531 --> 02:02:10.772]  Yeah, he admitted that there is a deep state.
[02:02:11.033 --> 02:02:16.376]  And the reason I'm calling in on the importance of that is because your boss, Alex, is in trial.
[02:02:17.225 --> 02:02:21.785]   and the lawyers in that trial dismissed it as a conspiracy theory.
[02:02:21.785 --> 02:02:27.064]   Well, you got Representative Congressman Steny Howard saying, "No, it is real."
[02:02:27.064 --> 02:02:35.505]   See, this is what I would call the gay frog effect, where it's just like some big joke,
[02:02:35.505 --> 02:02:37.865]  like, "Oh, you just say, 'Oh, gay frogs.'"
[02:02:37.895 --> 02:02:40.197]  It's like, haha, Alex Jones, gay frogs, haha.
[02:02:40.358 --> 02:02:43.621]  And it's like somehow that defeats Alex Jones intellectually.
[02:02:44.201 --> 02:02:47.405]  And of course, the ultimate irony is that the gay frog story was real.
[02:02:47.845 --> 02:02:48.966]  It wasn't even an Alex Jones story.
[02:02:48.986 --> 02:02:51.048]  It was a Berkeley, California.
[02:02:51.949 --> 02:03:10.378]   Research project and they found out the frogs were turning gay and and into hermaphrodites So they're like they think it's this bit like big gotcha comedy thing like high comedy like Alex Jones gay frogs Ha ha ha it's like well, that's actually a real story But that's what they do in these courtrooms and with these lawyers and these Democrats.
[02:03:10.398 --> 02:03:17.940]  They're just like, oh, Alex Jones, like, ah, yeah, he thinks this, he thinks the COVID vaccine is killing people, and he thinks frogs are gay, and he thinks there's a deep state.
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:20.101]  Ha, ho, ho, hee, hee, ho, ho, ho.
[02:03:20.441 --> 02:03:22.302]  And it's just, you just sit there in amazement.
[02:03:22.322 --> 02:03:26.243]  You're like, wow, okay, well, yeah, I guess there's no sunset either.
[02:03:26.303 --> 02:03:31.425]  The sun doesn't set in the west and rise in the east, and there's never a moon in the sky.
[02:03:31.485 --> 02:03:32.786]  I didn't see Jupiter last night.
[02:03:32.826 --> 02:03:33.386]  None of it exists.
[02:03:34.454 --> 02:03:37.035]  Yeah, well like I said, Norm Pattis brought it up.
[02:03:37.115 --> 02:03:41.596]  The attorney shot Norm Pattis down when he mentioned it, so... Pulling up the clip?
[02:03:42.757 --> 02:03:48.698]  Uh, no, but he said that there was a deep state, and they objected and said, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[02:03:49.299 --> 02:03:51.539]  And if Norm Pattis... It's a conspiracy theory!
[02:03:52.219 --> 02:03:56.921]  Right, if Norm Pattis could play that at the hearing, oh boy, would that ruin him.
[02:03:58.801 --> 02:04:00.622]  Well, they'll strike it from the record, probably.
[02:04:01.257 --> 02:04:02.137]  No, it's a clip.
[02:04:02.157 --> 02:04:03.277]  It's from the House floor.
[02:04:03.377 --> 02:04:05.818]  It's on the United States Congressional Record.
[02:04:06.478 --> 02:04:07.798]  But see, here's the problem.
[02:04:09.559 --> 02:04:10.119]  Boy, oh boy.
[02:04:10.259 --> 02:04:26.802]  Because now it turns into this issue, and this is why I'm glad I was actually, I thought Alex did a great job with his testimony because it becomes this issue, and I kind of think the judge almost kind of put her hands there like, well, I mean, I can be in control of the record, but what's going to happen here is going to happen here.
[02:04:27.714 --> 02:04:31.820]  And basically it turned into a debate between Alex and the lawyer.
[02:04:32.021 --> 02:04:42.777]  It's like the most pure political debate we've had in this country in years, but the record's going to be controlled and they want to be able to have this high ground stance, or the higher ground.
[02:04:43.638 --> 02:04:50.781]  To just be able to attack Alex however they want and say everything's a conspiracy theory, but it's like, okay, well, so at what point do we have to sit here?
[02:04:51.061 --> 02:04:58.524]  Does Alex Jones have to do the Alex Jones Show as a witness, testifying to show you that the stuff he's talking about is real and not crazy?
[02:04:58.544 --> 02:05:00.025]  Because that's what they're trying to do is...
[02:05:00.865 --> 02:05:15.428]  Paint this whole picture like Alex Jones is lying and none of this is real and it's all fake Well, well then let's have Alex Jones sit there for eight hours and you can and you can tell him all the stuff He said that's fake and then he can respond to each thing and show you how it's real But they don't want that to happen.
[02:05:15.468 --> 02:05:35.982]   They just want to be able to attack attack attack and not have Alex defend That's what the internet censorship is all about Yeah, but then you got Alex Jones was right if you play the clip that that would help your advertising or your shirt sales Yeah, I don't know if we're still selling that shirt or not, and it might be totally sold out.
[02:05:36.002 --> 02:05:40.006]  Well, that would be a good rerun for it.
[02:05:40.306 --> 02:05:41.907]  So anyway, that's the reason I called in.
[02:05:41.927 --> 02:05:44.269]  You guys have a wonderful day, and thanks again for all you do.
[02:05:45.190 --> 02:05:45.731]  Thanks, David.
[02:05:46.291 --> 02:05:48.873]  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.
[02:05:48.933 --> 02:05:50.175]  Joe, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.195 --> 02:05:50.575]  Go ahead.
[02:05:52.056 --> 02:05:55.079]  Hey, long-time listener, about 10 years, first-time caller.
[02:05:55.099 --> 02:05:59.883]  I just wanted to ask you about that leaked audio that came out of China.
[02:06:01.343 --> 02:06:08.108]  I know, like, one of your people that were on were saying that it sounded pretty authentic.
[02:06:08.508 --> 02:06:14.914]  And I was just wondering, you know, because the time frame that they were talking about was during the fall, which, of course, we're in right now.
[02:06:14.934 --> 02:06:18.316]  So, you know, just wondering what's going on.
[02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:20.098]  Have we heard anything back from it?
[02:06:20.158 --> 02:06:22.399]  Because I do only listen sporadically, so.
[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:27.624]  I, you know, I didn't take much credence into that, and so it was never really a concern of mine.
[02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:31.950]  We'll just have to see.
[02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:36.031]  I mean, I think China's kind of just sitting in the wings right now, waiting to see what Russia's going to do.
[02:06:36.091 --> 02:06:38.171]  Probably actually coordinating with Russia, quite frankly.
[02:06:38.712 --> 02:06:45.333]  I think Russia makes a move after the midterms, and then I think China moves into Taiwan after Russia has the U.S.
[02:06:45.373 --> 02:06:46.513]  distracted in Ukraine.
[02:06:46.933 --> 02:06:50.134]  And then Biden's going to be so in over his head that it's just going to be an embarrassment.
[02:06:51.454 --> 02:06:52.074]  I agree with you.
[02:06:52.234 --> 02:06:52.774]  I agree with you.
[02:06:52.854 --> 02:07:00.531]   But, you know, what I was worried about also with China is that You know, how they've been doing the joint exercises up in Trudeau land.
[02:07:00.632 --> 02:07:06.921]  So, you know, if that act is of evil comes to bear fruit, that's true, you know.
[02:07:07.982 --> 02:07:13.210]  A little skeptical about what's waiting in the wind for us, you know.
[02:07:14.557 --> 02:07:19.598]  There would be no need for China to launch a land invasion, especially at this point when Americans are still fat and happy.
[02:07:20.658 --> 02:07:32.121]  Maybe after the American economy totally collapses under Joe Biden, or we go into like another Great Depression under Joe Biden, if we get to that point, maybe China, but I don't think there's really any interest in a land invasion of the U.S.
[02:07:32.321 --> 02:07:32.921]  I really don't.
[02:07:33.781 --> 02:07:37.562]  You know, here's what's odd about that, you know, because I'm thinking this all on my head.
[02:07:39.262 --> 02:07:40.962]  Why is the U.S.
[02:07:41.102 --> 02:07:43.383]  not allowed to tap into our own resources?
[02:07:44.679 --> 02:07:45.919]  It's really an excellent question.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:47.640]  Why can't the U.S.
[02:07:47.700 --> 02:07:49.020]  tap into its own resources?
[02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:50.401]  We have all kinds of clean water.
[02:07:50.601 --> 02:07:53.402]  We have all kinds of gas and clean oil.
[02:07:53.982 --> 02:07:54.762]  We have coal.
[02:07:55.343 --> 02:07:58.004]  We've got all these resources, and we're not allowed to touch any of them.
[02:07:58.244 --> 02:08:02.125]  It's almost as if someone else owns those resources, and we're not allowed to have them.
[02:08:03.165 --> 02:08:05.426]  Yes, the Democrats and the World Economic Forum.
[02:08:05.646 --> 02:08:16.857]   That's why I was worried about, you know, as far as Putin, because he's, you know, part of those world economic guys, and even though he's You know, going against our policies right now, so I don't
[02:08:16.857 --> 02:08:22.027]   know if he's had a change of heart, but you know, maybe this, especially with Nord Stream 2 going
[02:08:22.027 --> 02:08:28.976]   down now, this is the beginning of the collapse where, you know, where the West does go down. Well,
[02:08:28.976 --> 02:08:33.936]   this is, you know, this is going to be, you're going to see the media hubris once again on full
[02:08:33.936 --> 02:08:39.306]   display tonight, and they're going to be puffing up their chests and saying how this is, how Russia's
[02:08:39.306 --> 02:08:44.047]   losing and all this stuff, and they're going to pretend like this pipeline is somehow
[02:08:44.047 --> 02:08:47.396]   bad for Russia, and it's just going to show their ignorance, it's going to show their hubris
[02:08:47.396 --> 02:08:52.697]   that they still are just completely clueless of the international state of affairs going on.
[02:08:52.958 --> 02:08:54.198]  This is horrible for Europe.
[02:08:54.479 --> 02:09:00.379]   This Nord Stream 2 pipeline going down, It couldn't be worse for Europe.
[02:09:02.299 --> 02:09:03.059]  It's just crazy.
[02:09:03.199 --> 02:09:12.302]  And if Russia continues to take control of Eastern Ukraine and those pipelines, I mean, there's going to be no oil going in to Europe, and Putin's going to say, well, why do you care?
[02:09:12.682 --> 02:09:14.022]  You don't believe in oil anyway.
[02:09:14.042 --> 02:09:15.123]  You're stopping global warming.
[02:09:16.243 --> 02:09:16.703]  That's true.
[02:09:16.923 --> 02:09:17.423]  That's true.
[02:09:17.703 --> 02:09:22.164]  And as far as, like, who owns it, it's the Democrats that are cutting it off.
[02:09:22.204 --> 02:09:28.226]   So, I mean, Trump was, you know, Doing the right thing and doing the America First agenda.
[02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:33.058]  And, you know, we see what happens when Democrats run the China First agenda.
[02:09:33.823 --> 02:09:37.006]  And isn't it amazing, too, that you had the same, it's the same deal.
[02:09:37.306 --> 02:09:50.276]  The European Union, the EU, all these European leaders, they would scoff at Donald Trump and they would laugh and they'd point their fingers and they'd rattle their jowls and, you know, oh, it's all, oh, look at how dumb Trump is.
[02:09:50.576 --> 02:09:52.098]  You know, they ought to be thanking Donald Trump.
[02:09:52.118 --> 02:09:55.921]  They should have been thanking their lucky stars that Donald Trump was the president for four years.
[02:09:56.181 --> 02:10:01.085]  Otherwise, they would have already had their oil and their energy shut off four years ago.
[02:10:02.338 --> 02:10:10.247]  So Donald Trump basically gave Europe four years of life before the Democrats came in and allowed Russia to shut energy production down.
[02:10:12.389 --> 02:10:22.521]  And now they're shutting down nuclear plants, they're shutting down... I tell you man, it is really a weird thing to watch people commit total civilizational suicide.
[02:10:24.246 --> 02:10:25.207]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:10:25.247 --> 02:10:35.221]  Especially with all the meat packing facilities, all these processing plants that are burning up.
[02:10:35.641 --> 02:10:37.363]  Are we over 100 yet?
[02:10:39.466 --> 02:10:39.827]  What's that?
[02:10:39.887 --> 02:10:40.407]  Are we what now?
[02:10:41.694 --> 02:10:44.659]  Are we over a hundred of them that have gone up in flames?
[02:10:44.879 --> 02:10:47.283]  I don't know if it's a hundred, but it's dozens.
[02:10:47.783 --> 02:10:52.711]  It's certainly dozens between the food processing plants and the oil refineries.
[02:10:52.791 --> 02:10:53.973]  Alright Joe, thanks for the call.
[02:10:53.993 --> 02:10:56.256]  Alright folks, Jay Dyer takes over on the other side.
[02:10:57.185 --> 02:11:00.846]  Remember, InfoWarsStore.com, SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:11:00.926 --> 02:11:03.587]  That's how we fund ourselves to stay on the air.
[02:11:03.687 --> 02:11:08.109]  If you want to help Alex Jones fight his legal fight right now, go to SaveInfoWars.com.
[02:11:08.369 --> 02:11:12.390]  If you want to get a great supplement and support the transmissions, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:11:12.710 --> 02:11:16.612]  Alright, I'm going to go do some prep work and I'll be hosting the War Room in an hour.
[02:11:16.532 --> 02:11:29.811]  Until then, Jay Dyer.
[02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:32.261]  And today is do or die time.
[02:11:33.321 --> 02:11:38.502]  If InfoWars gets the funding, end of the midterms, end of next year, we're going to stay on air and be more effective than ever.
[02:11:38.762 --> 02:11:45.304]  But if we don't, I respect your decision and I'm ready to basically implode and shut down our main operations.
[02:11:45.904 --> 02:11:47.545]  I've done my work.
[02:11:47.725 --> 02:11:49.305]  I've put everything into it.
[02:11:49.345 --> 02:11:50.125]  I'm leaving it all in the field.
[02:11:50.706 --> 02:11:56.695]   But I believe at a gut level You're going to come through, plus you're going to get great products that your family already need.
[02:11:57.296 --> 02:11:58.456]  So don't procrastinate.
[02:11:58.616 --> 02:11:59.477]  Show InfoWars.
[02:11:59.917 --> 02:12:00.878]  You want us to stay on the air.
[02:12:01.298 --> 02:12:04.620]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, where we got three great products back in stock.
[02:12:05.040 --> 02:12:08.682]  Vitamin C and Zinc, highest quality, super strong, back in stock.
[02:12:09.043 --> 02:12:12.785]  Vitamin D3 and Calcium, and of course, DNA Force Plus.
[02:12:13.225 --> 02:12:18.428]  All these products are 50% off together in a combo pack, or 40% off individually.
[02:12:18.828 --> 02:12:20.890]  So they're great products you already need for your immune system.
[02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:22.791]  And we need the money to stay on air.
[02:12:23.031 --> 02:12:24.173]  So please take action now.
[02:12:24.313 --> 02:12:24.653]  Thank you.
[02:12:25.534 --> 02:12:26.755]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:26.795 --> 02:12:29.457]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:12:30.098 --> 02:12:39.467]  As you know, in the fourth hour, when I take over, we typically lecture through a lot of these high-powered globalist tomes, a lot of the white papers, a lot of the books, a lot of the documents.
[02:12:40.128 --> 02:12:46.694]  And really, this becomes a kind of a grad course, hopefully, in understanding the elite perspective from their own view.
[02:12:47.566 --> 02:12:54.653]  And as you know, some of the most important texts are the texts like Earl Quigley that we've covered, Tragedy and Hope, Anglo-American Establishment.
[02:12:54.693 --> 02:12:58.456]  Dr. Quigley, of course, was the CFR historian and archivist.
[02:12:58.496 --> 02:13:04.842]  He was the mentor of, how dare you, Bill Clinton at Georgetown, military historian.
[02:13:04.882 --> 02:13:12.750]  And he was able to give us a bird's eye view of the elite from their own archives and writings as an apologist, not as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13:13.599 --> 02:13:33.028]  And in line with his work, we also covered and lectured through the well-known works of Dr. Professor Anthony Sutton, who also was not any kind of conspiratorial writer, but an economist, a kind of a historian of economics and working at various institutes, I think the Hoover Institute or Hudson Institute, one of the two.
[02:13:33.788 --> 02:13:40.671]  Sutton dug up all of these cables and all this information that the Bolsheviks have been funded and supported by Wall Street.
[02:13:41.741 --> 02:13:51.025]  And of course he has another book where he talks about how the fascists were also supported and funded in terms of Hitler and the Axis powers via a lot of big money.
[02:13:51.045 --> 02:14:01.289]  A lot of wealthy JP Morgan, Rockefeller, Rothschild type interests funding and trying to control both sides of this World War II dialectic.
[02:14:02.389 --> 02:14:04.050]  Sort of gaming the game, right?
[02:14:04.090 --> 02:14:07.551]  Gaming the outcome to be in control of whoever ended up winning.
[02:14:08.610 --> 02:14:14.694]  And if you don't know, I just did do a final full lecture through at my website, the totality of that book.
[02:14:15.114 --> 02:14:19.036]  And I came across in my research another excellent unknown text.
[02:14:19.416 --> 02:14:31.343]  Now, this is not written by a person from the establishment, but an independent historian who did his own lengthy, super hundreds and hundreds of footnotes analysis of the Milner-Fabian conspiracy.
[02:14:31.403 --> 02:14:33.744]  And this is so crucial to understanding where we are.
[02:14:33.784 --> 02:14:35.085]  You've heard me lecture through H.G.
[02:14:35.125 --> 02:14:35.405]  Wells.
[02:14:35.425 --> 02:14:46.438]   You've heard me lecture through Bertrand Russell, various members of, at one time or another, the Fabian Society and how they were so influential in the next phase of the revolution.
[02:14:46.498 --> 02:14:47.639]  What do I mean by the revolution?
[02:14:47.799 --> 02:14:56.430]  I'm talking about revolutionary philosophy from the time of the Enlightenment and its various phases, its various instantiations, all the way up to the present day.
[02:14:57.751 --> 02:15:01.393]  No, I don't know that there's one group necessarily that was the group behind everything.
[02:15:01.453 --> 02:15:09.437]  Certainly a lot of groups, a lot of power players played an interest or had a role and had an interest in furthering revolutionary thought.
[02:15:10.717 --> 02:15:17.641]  But more recently, I found this excellent book called The Milner-Fabian Conspiracy and it's going to be the next book that I lecture through.
[02:15:18.422 --> 02:15:21.584]  And as I traveled this last weekend, I got a chance to read a good bit of it.
[02:15:22.105 --> 02:15:30.150]  And I thought, well, I've got to talk about this book because it's almost like the next puzzle piece after you've read Quigley and Sutton.
[02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:32.632]  This is by an author, a Romanian author, historian.
[02:15:32.652 --> 02:15:40.017]  His name is Ioan Ratiu, and he really makes the next layer, the next level of connection, bringing this same conspiracy.
[02:15:40.737 --> 02:15:48.585]   And if we want to call it Maybe a better term since the CIA has really sort of weaponized the term conspiracy theory.
[02:15:49.265 --> 02:15:56.849]  This is really the next phase of espionage and infiltration to take over and implement a new world order.
[02:15:56.889 --> 02:16:14.909]   And what he does in this book is actually document from the time of Marx in the 1800s up to the Bolsheviks The support that came from them in a monetary way so that they could have their world revolution up to the present day with Bilderberg and Klaus and all of those goons.
[02:16:15.885 --> 02:16:24.010]  So he does an excellent job of really filling in what was missing, because remember, you know, Quigley and Sutton, they were writing in the 60s, 70s, and I think into the 80s with Professor Sutton.
[02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:39.658]  He had worked, I think, with Patrick Wood before he passed away, Sutton that is, to put out some text dealing with technocracy and how we get from Marxism-Socialism to today's World Economic Forum technocracy slash transhumanism.
[02:16:39.698 --> 02:16:47.537]   So this is a huge puzzle piece in this historical, world historical geopolitical analysis.
[02:16:47.537 --> 02:16:51.577]   And I think you're really gonna be impressed with the research of Yoan Ratiu
[02:16:51.577 --> 02:16:53.217]  and how he makes these connections.
[02:16:53.217 --> 02:16:57.138]   But I wanna remind you that if you wanna keep the InfoWars going, if you want to win,
[02:16:57.138 --> 02:17:01.256]   you need to go over to the InfoWars store, buy those products, support Alex,
[02:17:01.256 --> 02:17:06.818]   especially as they're being persecuted at InfoWars and buy those products, get the documentaries,
[02:17:06.818 --> 02:17:08.237]  get the health products.
[02:17:08.718 --> 02:17:10.520]  I just got some of Alex's iodine.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:11.200]  I've been taking it.
[02:17:11.261 --> 02:17:11.781]  It's great.
[02:17:12.021 --> 02:17:13.142]  Get the nascent iodine.
[02:17:13.503 --> 02:17:15.144]  Get the Coral Calcium.
[02:17:15.265 --> 02:17:15.885]  Great toothpaste.
[02:17:15.945 --> 02:17:16.626]  All those products.
[02:17:17.487 --> 02:17:18.528]  And we'll be right back.
[02:17:19.649 --> 02:17:20.870]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:20.890 --> 02:17:23.313]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:17:23.373 --> 02:17:35.633]   We are covering The key puzzle pieces that take us from Marx and the revolutionary philosophy of the 1700s, 1800s up until today with Klaus and the World Economic Forum.
[02:17:35.653 --> 02:17:39.116]  We have to understand how we got to where we are to understand what's really going on.
[02:17:39.176 --> 02:17:47.381]  If we don't have that historical context, we're not going to understand what's going on in terms of the plan ending and destruction of the energy system.
[02:17:47.421 --> 02:17:48.322]  That's what's going on.
[02:17:48.362 --> 02:17:54.046]  You just saw the pipeline issues today, which I think Biden had said would happen, right?
[02:17:55.430 --> 02:17:56.711]  And, uh, what was he saying?
[02:17:56.751 --> 02:18:00.655]  Like, that he would go after these pipelines if there was an invasion?
[02:18:01.716 --> 02:18:02.837]  Just bomb the pipeline.
[02:18:03.017 --> 02:18:04.078]  Just get the vaccine.
[02:18:04.559 --> 02:18:05.540]  Just get the vaccine.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.001]  He should go back to whispering.
[02:18:08.021 --> 02:18:09.342]  I enjoyed whispering Biden.
[02:18:09.362 --> 02:18:12.763]  That was my favorite of the various Biden instantiations.
[02:18:14.825 --> 02:18:21.988]  The attack on energy, I think, is going to play into the overall austerity collapse that they want to engineer.
[02:18:22.068 --> 02:18:28.472]  I don't know how soon they're going to try to push for this collapse, but we know they're going to have this engineered austerity that they're going to bring in.
[02:18:29.261 --> 02:18:35.766]  And engineered austerity gives the impression that, oh, we don't have enough food, there's not enough resources, there's too many people.
[02:18:36.226 --> 02:18:38.128]  That's where they're really going to take all this stuff, right?
[02:18:38.668 --> 02:18:42.871]  And we already have, what, Prince Charles and all these other people saying that very thing, right?
[02:18:43.192 --> 02:18:56.021]  I was listening to the clip earlier on today's broadcast where they were playing Prince Charles talking about, we need four, uh, we need four, uh, to, to, to handle the current pandemic.
[02:18:56.081 --> 02:18:57.022]  He's so breathy.
[02:18:57.685 --> 02:18:57.865]  Right?
[02:18:57.945 --> 02:18:59.125]  It's so much, so much breath.
[02:18:59.165 --> 02:18:59.906]  Just talk, dude.
[02:18:59.926 --> 02:19:00.946]  Just say what you're saying.
[02:19:00.966 --> 02:19:02.066]  Why are you being so breathy?
[02:19:04.507 --> 02:19:05.667]  We don't need four Earths.
[02:19:05.987 --> 02:19:07.407]  I mean, I just flew to D.C.
[02:19:07.447 --> 02:19:08.128]  and flew back.
[02:19:08.388 --> 02:19:10.668]  Giant swaths of land with nobody.
[02:19:11.288 --> 02:19:15.169]  Just for hundreds of miles, swaths of land with no people.
[02:19:15.189 --> 02:19:16.050]  What are you talking about?
[02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:17.290]  All right.
[02:19:17.370 --> 02:19:17.990]  Four Earths?
[02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:19.671]  I don't know where they come up with four Earths, right?
[02:19:19.711 --> 02:19:20.251]  This is crazy.
[02:19:22.392 --> 02:19:27.494]  But that's all really just playing into the idea that there's not enough resources for everybody, so everybody has to die, right?
[02:19:27.794 --> 02:19:28.395]  And who does that mean?
[02:19:28.415 --> 02:19:31.436]  Well, that means all the plebs die, and then we will have the resources.
[02:19:31.476 --> 02:19:32.036]  That's all that means.
[02:19:32.696 --> 02:19:33.677]  That's the translation there.
[02:19:33.697 --> 02:19:45.942]  So, controlling energy, shutting down energy is crucial to the overall World Economic Forum plan because they have to have the appearance of austerity and that there's not enough resources to go around.
[02:19:46.022 --> 02:19:47.663]  It's just Malthusianism repackaged.
[02:19:47.683 --> 02:19:48.043]  That's it.
[02:19:48.183 --> 02:19:48.883]  That's all it is.
[02:19:49.663 --> 02:19:50.964]  And where does this idea come from?
[02:19:51.519 --> 02:20:01.186]  Where's the idea come from of creating engineered collapses and engineered food crises and limited resource allocation?
[02:20:01.226 --> 02:20:04.368]  Now, in a sense, yeah, there's limited resources in different areas and different places.
[02:20:04.388 --> 02:20:04.868]  Sure.
[02:20:05.429 --> 02:20:07.090]  Not every place has every resource.
[02:20:07.570 --> 02:20:17.898]  But the idea that we've far surpassed Earth's carrying capacity such that the humans are now somehow destroying the planet is propaganda.
[02:20:17.958 --> 02:20:18.518]  That's all that is.
[02:20:19.033 --> 02:20:22.036]  And it's propaganda to fit a certain ideology, but where does that come from?
[02:20:22.056 --> 02:20:38.610]  We know about Malthus, but there's another key ideology we have to understand that also utilizes these tactics and principles, and that is socialism and its more devious, more cunning form of Marxism, Fabian socialism.
[02:20:39.871 --> 02:20:47.520]   But before we get to that, we have to understand there's a transition in the revolutionary period that occurred to take us away from The medieval worldview.
[02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:51.842]  Now, the medieval worldview, the medieval systems of feudalism and monarchy, they were full of problems.
[02:20:52.182 --> 02:20:52.822]  No doubt about it.
[02:20:54.363 --> 02:20:55.344]  There were corrupt rulers.
[02:20:55.384 --> 02:20:56.324]  There were corrupt kings.
[02:20:56.364 --> 02:20:57.805]  There were tyrants.
[02:20:57.825 --> 02:21:02.007]  There was all kinds of problematic things that we could point to.
[02:21:03.638 --> 02:21:19.727]  But what happened was, in order for certain interests and certain powers to want to get rid of the existing order, they felt that it was necessary to align themselves with any sort of revolutionary fervor or movement to break down the existing order.
[02:21:19.787 --> 02:21:26.790]  Now, for some of these interests, the long-term goal had nothing to do with the goofy ideology of the ideologue.
[02:21:27.130 --> 02:21:27.951]  They didn't really care.
[02:21:28.795 --> 02:21:43.364]  And this is the movement away from church and state having a key role in society, and by the state I mean the traditional state as in the monarchy, which ironically was far more libertarian than the socialists would be.
[02:21:45.465 --> 02:21:50.568]  To moving away from that, not directly to socialism and Marxism, but to liberal democracy.
[02:21:51.826 --> 02:22:00.334]  But remember, most people who kind of get into Cold War stuff or Marxist studies, they'll think, oh, well, Marx was the enemy of liberal democracy, right?
[02:22:00.514 --> 02:22:01.535]  He didn't like liberalism.
[02:22:02.256 --> 02:22:09.883]  He wanted this sort of either totalitarian communist control or a eventual utopia where the state would wither away, right?
[02:22:10.771 --> 02:22:23.819]  But actually, in the early career of Marx, when he was first really getting energized to engage in revolutionary work and propaganda, Marx actually aligned himself with Lib Dem, with the liberal democratic movement.
[02:22:26.301 --> 02:22:31.844]  And why would he do that, given that Marxism eventually sees liberal democracy as a crucial enemy?
[02:22:31.884 --> 02:22:33.665]  Well, he did that because he was pragmatic.
[02:22:34.606 --> 02:22:36.487]  He was very cunning, very deceptive.
[02:22:36.527 --> 02:22:38.328]  He was known as a kind of a fraudster con man.
[02:22:39.269 --> 02:22:45.542]   And Marx said, You know, we're never going to immediately get people to flip into full-on collectivist revolution.
[02:22:45.762 --> 02:22:57.491]  What we got to do is align ourselves with whatever the immediate counter-establishment movement is, and at this point it was liberal democracy and liberal economic theory.
[02:22:57.511 --> 02:23:16.642]   He said, let's align with that as far as we need to, and then they will do the work of destroying the existing order for us, then we will come in as we infiltrate They're liberal democracy and turn it to full-on communist revolution or gradual socialism.
[02:23:17.103 --> 02:23:31.068]   This is where the Fabians come in and the Fabian Society comes in because what we've noticed throughout the 20th century is that although Classical Marxism failed in terms of how it viewed the revolution.
[02:23:31.128 --> 02:23:32.389]  Its economic theories failed.
[02:23:32.849 --> 02:23:35.571]  Most classical Marxists have admitted, okay, it doesn't really work.
[02:23:36.031 --> 02:23:38.873]  We didn't get the proletariat to rise up, right?
[02:23:38.913 --> 02:23:50.480]  The guy bringing, you know, the canteen to work with his coffee and his lunch pail, you know, doesn't really care about sitting around and theorizing about the means and modes of production.
[02:23:51.900 --> 02:23:54.322]  And so since we didn't really get that, we've got to regroup.
[02:23:55.350 --> 02:24:10.018]  And this is where we get a lot of split-offs and different directions after Marx's time for Marxism and Socialism to go in various schools, to go underground, to go into kind of, in some cases it's been described as kind of reformed Marxism.
[02:24:11.479 --> 02:24:14.900]  And that is one of the terms that we get for Fabian Socialism.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:22.351]   Now, of course, Fabianism comes from one of the Roman generals who fought the Carthaginians, And he came up with a strategy.
[02:24:22.931 --> 02:24:30.214]  He wasn't a socialist per se, but the idea is just a term derived from his military strategy, which is gradualism.
[02:24:30.934 --> 02:24:42.399]  Slow implementation of this process rather than the straight on hardcore, let's have an overnight revolution that Marx and Lenin and some of these people originally thought would be the way that they would bring it in.
[02:24:43.982 --> 02:24:51.465]  But right away, when Marxism began to try the hardcore revolutionary approach, they engaged in what is known as Red Terror.
[02:24:51.945 --> 02:24:56.206]  And most of the early Marxists openly called for the necessity of Red Terror.
[02:24:56.426 --> 02:25:00.488]  Terror in Germany, terror in Russia, the Paris Commune, etc.
[02:25:01.988 --> 02:25:09.831]  Red Terror, in fact, also was called upon by most Marxist leaders, maybe not so much openly, but more so on the down-low, right?
[02:25:11.869 --> 02:25:16.290]  This is why, for example, Mao, as well, engaged in using terror.
[02:25:17.250 --> 02:25:40.456]  This is why many Marxist-inspired groups have utilized terror, because terror, including things like the IRA at times, and I know that the IRA was eventually infiltrated and a lot of that had to do with false flags, I understand that as well, but this is also what happens, especially in Europe, where a lot of the nationalist parties end up getting eventually co-opted into various forms of socialism, Marxism.
[02:25:42.401 --> 02:26:06.814]  When we look at the history of Fabianism, this comes out of Britain especially, and it's kind of pioneered by these pseudo-intellectuals, particularly George Bernard Shaw, the famous playwright, who decided that he wanted to take on this idea of economics, and he read Marx's Das Kapital when he was a young guy, and he got really into straight-up hardcore revolutionary Marxism.
[02:26:07.719 --> 02:26:13.761]  And then he started to realize, as a lot of Marxists did at that time, that the economic theories didn't really work.
[02:26:13.921 --> 02:26:15.621]  Where is the proletariat revolution?
[02:26:15.641 --> 02:26:16.302]  It's not happening.
[02:26:16.962 --> 02:26:22.363]  So they decided, let's regroup and rethink how Marxism will happen and how the revolution will happen.
[02:26:23.024 --> 02:26:28.165]  And they came up with, again, the idea of borrowing the Roman general's idea of Fabianism.
[02:26:28.225 --> 02:26:38.712]   Let's do a gradual approach and let's utilize, through subversion and infiltration, Every possible means of liberal movement that exists already.
[02:26:39.172 --> 02:26:40.072]  Let them do the work.
[02:26:40.152 --> 02:26:42.113]  Why do we have to try to force a revolution?
[02:26:42.133 --> 02:26:52.143]   We're never going to get a revolution with a bunch of, you know, low-level workers and, you know, Lazy academics sitting around armchairs theorizing about how to have a revolution.
[02:26:52.503 --> 02:26:58.567]  Let's utilize existing movements, the Liberal Party, and this is where the Labour Party comes to be in the UK.
[02:26:59.208 --> 02:27:06.832]  The Labour Party was begun by mostly people who were either Fabians or influenced by Marxist thought directly or indirectly.
[02:27:08.213 --> 02:27:13.617]  And so it didn't matter, well we're going to go to a break, but when we come back we're going to get deeper into Fabianism.
[02:27:14.386 --> 02:27:15.347]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:15.367 --> 02:27:17.588]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:27:17.648 --> 02:27:27.814]  We are getting into the excellent, basically an espionage analysis from Johan Ratjou of the Milner-Fabian infiltration strategies and conspiracy.
[02:27:28.315 --> 02:27:40.002]  The way that we get from Marxism, Socialism and Monopoly Capitalism, which funded it, all the way up to Bilderberg World Economic Forum that we have today, also with Monopoly Capital funding all of that.
[02:27:41.412 --> 02:27:51.325]  And the idea here that the Fabians really were convinced of was that although Marx got some things wrong, Bernard Shaw thought, okay, Marx got some things wrong, but you know what?
[02:27:51.365 --> 02:27:56.011]  He was actually right about this idea of scientific governance that eventually we could have.
[02:27:56.631 --> 02:28:02.515]  Scientific governance and Marx seemed to think that his Marxism was actually scientific economic theory.
[02:28:02.755 --> 02:28:03.816]  It was just hard science.
[02:28:04.016 --> 02:28:04.897]  No way to deny it.
[02:28:05.357 --> 02:28:09.440]  And he basically equated it to and allied it to Darwinism.
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:11.582]  Marx had a very high view of Darwin.
[02:28:11.602 --> 02:28:16.505]  I think he even wrote like a dedication in one of his texts to Darwin.
[02:28:16.545 --> 02:28:25.461]   And so he thought, well, this is all just pure science and anybody who disagrees with Marxist theory Is not trusting the science.
[02:28:25.481 --> 02:28:26.321]  Does that sound familiar?
[02:28:27.341 --> 02:28:29.002]  Have we heard anything like that recently?
[02:28:29.022 --> 02:28:29.962]  Right?
[02:28:30.002 --> 02:28:33.443]  Just trust the science, scientific governance.
[02:28:34.284 --> 02:28:37.925]  Thus, you can see, oh, we're beginning to move towards the technocracy, right?
[02:28:37.965 --> 02:28:43.306]  This is what gets us to the idea that, hey, we got to get rid of politicians and politicians are the problem.
[02:28:45.187 --> 02:28:49.789]  Politicians are out there for self-interest, they're goofy, they're puppets.
[02:28:49.829 --> 02:28:51.009]  Now, a lot of that's true.
[02:28:51.821 --> 02:28:57.644]  And I think everybody can kind of see that now, especially 2022 U.S., right?
[02:28:58.744 --> 02:29:02.466]  Kind of have like old folks on people like running things and they don't know where they are.
[02:29:03.207 --> 02:29:06.388]  Well, at least running things in the public purview, not actually running.
[02:29:06.708 --> 02:29:06.868]  Right.
[02:29:07.709 --> 02:29:12.411]  And so the idea here is, well, look, don't you disagree with dementia people running things?
[02:29:13.111 --> 02:29:16.273]  Well, then why don't we have experts run stuff, man?
[02:29:16.613 --> 02:29:17.093]  Yeah.
[02:29:17.153 --> 02:29:17.394]  Right.
[02:29:17.414 --> 02:29:24.213]   Get rid of the get rid of goofy politicians and let's have Government by experts, managerial experts.
[02:29:24.253 --> 02:29:25.995]  Now, well, who are the experts?
[02:29:26.595 --> 02:29:27.456]  And experts in what?
[02:29:27.556 --> 02:29:27.957]  Everything?
[02:29:28.017 --> 02:29:31.660]  Yes, in everything, but particularly in technocracy, right?
[02:29:31.961 --> 02:29:36.785]  Technocracy is government by expert, managerial governance.
[02:29:37.306 --> 02:29:38.247]  Get rid of politicians.
[02:29:38.427 --> 02:29:39.248]  We don't even need that.
[02:29:40.149 --> 02:29:45.534]  And so I kind of think that they really want politics to look ridiculous, politicians to look ridiculous, and they are.
[02:29:46.266 --> 02:29:49.068]  So that they can say, look, don't you guys want to cry out?
[02:29:49.088 --> 02:29:49.769]  Remember Klaus?
[02:29:50.249 --> 02:29:52.571]  We will all cry out for the solution.
[02:29:52.611 --> 02:29:54.532]  We will offer the solution to you.
[02:29:54.552 --> 02:29:55.313]  Well, that's what they want.
[02:29:56.033 --> 02:30:02.518]  And this is actually in line with the notions of scientific governance of the Fabian Socialists.
[02:30:03.559 --> 02:30:15.247]  And if, by the way, it's funny, because if you ever criticize this back in, you know, the days of the Fabians or the Marxists, 100 years ago, 120 years ago, 150 years ago, they would say you're bourgeoisie.
[02:30:16.161 --> 02:30:18.542]  Oh, all your criticisms are just bourgeoisie.
[02:30:18.742 --> 02:30:21.902]  Well, that makes Marxism and Socialism basically unfalsifiable.
[02:30:22.503 --> 02:30:27.684]  You can't even offer criticism because your criticisms only come from bourgeois mentality, right?
[02:30:28.404 --> 02:30:32.225]  And now, if you think this is a little bit of a stretch, well, what did Klaus say?
[02:30:32.245 --> 02:30:37.086]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing, but you'll be happy.
[02:30:37.646 --> 02:30:41.947]  So we'll satisfy you on a kind of pleasure principle basis.
[02:30:42.568 --> 02:30:43.888]  You're not going to actually own anything.
[02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:52.312]  All of that circular economy, austerity economy, sustainable economy stuff is just repackaged socialism.
[02:30:52.392 --> 02:30:52.932]  That's all it is.
[02:30:53.472 --> 02:31:07.275]  But it's not socialism in a classical sense or in a it's more like a blending of monopoly capital with socialism and elements of a free market all together in one system.
[02:31:07.936 --> 02:31:13.537]  And a lot of people get trapped up in the they get caught up in the dialectics and they can't figure out what the real system is.
[02:31:14.324 --> 02:31:19.606]  Because this is a key point for the Fabians and for other Marxists as well and even Marx himself.
[02:31:20.306 --> 02:31:23.987]  Marxism has the ability to kind of morph and change into different things.
[02:31:24.667 --> 02:31:34.950]  So you can be a committed Marxist and support Lib Dems and support monopoly capital if it's necessary and useful at the time.
[02:31:34.970 --> 02:31:41.552]  Then you can flip or gradually implement the more hardcore Marxist principles over time.
[02:31:43.115 --> 02:31:46.278]  It's also structured in a secret society type of way.
[02:31:46.698 --> 02:31:58.648]  Now, in terms of what Quigley talks about, we know that there really was a secret society set up that was kind of the inner core of what would eventually be the British Empire at the apex of the British Empire.
[02:31:59.208 --> 02:32:05.474]  This was the Rhodes, Milner, Rothschild inner core, as they called the secret elect.
[02:32:05.694 --> 02:32:07.195]  They were called the secret elect.
[02:32:08.968 --> 02:32:11.510]  And it was a, uh, it was a secret society.
[02:32:12.031 --> 02:32:15.934]  And that's admitted by Sutton, that's admitted by Quigley, all literally called a secret society.
[02:32:16.334 --> 02:32:17.115]  Modeled on what?
[02:32:17.275 --> 02:32:17.895]  On the Jesuit.
[02:32:18.316 --> 02:32:32.167]  They weren't Jesuits, but they modeled the structure on the idea of Jesuit order, and that the outer ring of the helpers, the outer party, would help the inner core elite who were actually just running the British Empire.
[02:32:32.267 --> 02:32:33.568]  That's the real Illuminati in my view.
[02:32:35.289 --> 02:32:36.470]  Now, were they Marxist?
[02:32:37.251 --> 02:32:37.571]  Kind of.
[02:32:38.394 --> 02:32:45.197]  Not every person was necessarily a committed ideologue Marxist, because remember, pragmatic power politics is really what dominates.
[02:32:45.577 --> 02:32:51.579]  They don't really care so much about the ideology, as long as it gets you to the end goal of control.
[02:32:52.619 --> 02:32:55.861]  So if you need to support fascism, do it.
[02:32:55.881 --> 02:32:58.162]  If you need to support democracy, do it.
[02:32:58.182 --> 02:33:04.524]  If you need to support communism, socialism, whatever is necessary at the time is fine, as long as we get to this end goal of what?
[02:33:05.567 --> 02:33:08.328]  of technocratic total control and depopulation.
[02:33:08.348 --> 02:33:12.009]  That's the only thing that's kind of, that's the thing that's the end goal for everybody.
[02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:13.430]  And they don't disagree.
[02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:19.732]  There's nobody amongst the global elite, in the sense of World Bank, Foreign, Bilderberg, all this stuff, who disagrees with those things.
[02:33:19.832 --> 02:33:23.393]  And again, I've done whole videos on this, talking about the 10 commandments of the elite.
[02:33:25.074 --> 02:33:26.395]  And they all agree, right?
[02:33:27.575 --> 02:33:30.776]  So there's an inner party elite, and guess who else had that same structure?
[02:33:30.816 --> 02:33:33.077]  Well, Marxism has the inner party elite.
[02:33:33.803 --> 02:33:36.604]  And in the outer structure of the party, the Communist Party.
[02:33:39.345 --> 02:33:42.885]  And that's because these are controlled.
[02:33:43.306 --> 02:33:50.788]  These are movements that are funded and aided by the money power, by the corporate power, because it's useful and advantageous.
[02:33:52.368 --> 02:33:59.670]  How would it be useful and advantageous, again, to support something like internationalism, international Marxist movement?
[02:34:00.856 --> 02:34:03.878]  Well, let's think about what internationalism requires.
[02:34:04.018 --> 02:34:06.900]  Internationalism requires international law.
[02:34:09.061 --> 02:34:24.432]  In the capitalist revolution of, in the times of, you know, Adam Smith and David Ricardo and, you know, those figures, John Locke, we'd had the idea of establishing sovereign nation states that would abide by international law.
[02:34:24.452 --> 02:34:33.861]   So even though there were still sovereign nation states, They accepted, in principle, international law for goods and commerce to be done.
[02:34:35.223 --> 02:34:38.847]  Then we get, with the socialist Marxist revolution, the next phase of revolution.
[02:34:38.907 --> 02:34:42.912]  Remember, the capitalist revolution at that time is still part of revolutionary philosophy.
[02:34:43.999 --> 02:34:46.002]  Not saying everybody who's a capitalist is a bad person.
[02:34:46.022 --> 02:34:53.714]  I'm just saying that this is a historical fact that Enlightenment capitalism is a revolutionary philosophy against the medieval system.
[02:34:54.175 --> 02:34:56.939]  And I'm aware that there were abuses in the medieval system.
[02:34:56.959 --> 02:34:57.360]  Sure, I know that.
[02:34:57.944 --> 02:35:04.885]  But the point is that Marx's logic was, and he thought this was ironclad history, scientific history, right?
[02:35:05.265 --> 02:35:20.849]  Was that, well, the next phase after capital, since it has established the structure of commerce around international law in nation-state, is to get rid of nation-states to have international state based around international law.
[02:35:21.209 --> 02:35:31.592]   That's the logic of Marx and then by extension eventually the Fabian Socialists who were explicitly internationalists as are pretty much all the Marxists.
[02:35:31.632 --> 02:35:43.263]  Lenin has a famous quote where he says that the basic principle of Marxism and my international is to get rid of all nation states and to have international world order.
[02:35:44.384 --> 02:35:47.607]  New world order is essentially what he says.
[02:35:47.647 --> 02:35:48.963]   Now What happens?
[02:35:49.143 --> 02:35:53.666]  Well, when this attempts to be pushed forward, we get millions and millions, hundreds of millions of people dead.
[02:35:53.927 --> 02:35:54.187]  Perhaps.
[02:35:54.267 --> 02:35:55.168]  Perhaps a hundred million people.
[02:35:55.328 --> 02:35:56.209]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:35:56.249 --> 02:35:57.550]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:58.310 --> 02:35:59.471]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:59.491 --> 02:36:10.541]  We are detailing the history of Fabianism and its Marxist underpinnings that bring us up to where we are today in understanding the world like our forum, Klaus, Great Reset, etc.
[02:36:11.613 --> 02:36:29.402]   Now, by the 1850s, Rothschild writes in the book that we're covering, that basically Marxism had adopted and accepted that it was necessary to be highly deceptive and utilize all Techniques of infiltration and subversion in order to bring about the revolution.
[02:36:29.422 --> 02:36:34.163]  Of course, the revolution in the Marxist sense didn't actually occur the way they thought, right?
[02:36:34.183 --> 02:36:47.805]  They thought it would be a world revolution and then you would have, you know, the dictatorship phase and then eventually in Marx's thesis, the dictatorship would be global and then that would wither away to a libertarian final goal.
[02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:49.185]  I'm not joking.
[02:36:49.305 --> 02:36:58.521]   Marx actually had this libertarian idea that the state would be done away with After the dictatorship phase of communism.
[02:36:59.201 --> 02:37:01.542]  We also have to keep in mind that Marx contradicted himself.
[02:37:01.562 --> 02:37:03.043]  A lot of people can't figure this out.
[02:37:03.083 --> 02:37:06.325]  They get all tripped up and confused about what is and isn't Marxism.
[02:37:06.706 --> 02:37:09.047]  It's an ever-evolving morphing thing.
[02:37:09.587 --> 02:37:11.869]  So there's not one consistent Marxism.
[02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:32.227]   There's different offshoots and Marx himself sort of modified and evolved his philosophy over time and that's why it's kind of difficult to really pin it down and that's by design because they recognize the need to be Highly deceptive, to be highly cagey, dodgy, sus, the kids might say.
[02:37:33.568 --> 02:37:43.937]  And that was by design in order to further revolution by any means, including alignment, even openly at times, with big capital to become state capitalism.
[02:37:44.177 --> 02:37:48.221]  Again, which kind of makes it a little bit indistinguishable from fascism.
[02:37:48.481 --> 02:37:51.544]  Fascism is big state corporatism capitalism, right?
[02:37:52.273 --> 02:37:58.902]  But of course, in Marxism at times you get these ethical issues that also go along with the revolution.
[02:37:58.922 --> 02:38:02.707]  For example, Lenin was one of the first to bring abortion into Russia.
[02:38:05.123 --> 02:38:14.629]  So sometimes the more revolutionary minded Marxist went all out with the revolution in terms of ethics and morals, right?
[02:38:14.669 --> 02:38:20.972]  Let's totally overturn the ethics and the morals because, of course, if you don't believe in abortion, then that's bourgeoisie.
[02:38:21.653 --> 02:38:26.996]  Basically, everything is bourgeoisie that doesn't go along with the revolution.
[02:38:27.916 --> 02:38:59.674]   But what's also fascinating is that the Labour Party itself in England, which if you remember when we covered the Sutton book, Sutton talked about how the Labour Party and other leaders in Britain, including Lord Alfred Milner, who's going to play key in this book, The Milner Conspiracy, they really pushed, because they liked the ideas of Fabianism, they really pushed for Labour and other left parties to be the means by which Britain would concede to Fabianism
[02:39:00.504 --> 02:39:01.224]  Down the road.
[02:39:01.965 --> 02:39:03.105]  It doesn't have to be overnight.
[02:39:03.465 --> 02:39:04.646]  Let's just have a slow plan.
[02:39:04.846 --> 02:39:05.786]  It's that simple.
[02:39:06.806 --> 02:39:17.090]  And in the United States, the reason that we've seen this gradual slide into more and more policies of socialism is the same pattern, the same technique, right?
[02:39:17.839 --> 02:39:30.785]  And it's actually the same elite powers, the alignment between the British establishment, moneyed elite, and the US corporate elite, Rockefeller, JP Morgan interests, etc.
[02:39:30.825 --> 02:39:43.651]  That alignment is precisely why we see the same policy of the movement towards liberal socialism in England and the same movement in terms of movement towards liberal socialism in America.
[02:39:44.338 --> 02:39:46.158]  This helps explain Obama, right?
[02:39:46.178 --> 02:39:47.079]  A lot of people didn't understand.
[02:39:47.139 --> 02:39:48.359]  Oh, Obama's a communist!
[02:39:48.399 --> 02:39:49.219]  He's a communist!
[02:39:49.279 --> 02:39:49.939]  He's a Marxist!
[02:39:50.779 --> 02:39:52.219]  Mmm, kinda, but not really.
[02:39:52.740 --> 02:39:55.340]  Because, who was the biggest donor and controller?
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:57.760]  Back, remember, everybody talked about this when Obama was in.
[02:39:58.501 --> 02:39:59.641]  I'd like to think, uh, J.P.
[02:39:59.661 --> 02:39:59.901]  Morgan.
[02:40:00.341 --> 02:40:01.541]  I'd like to think, I think Goldman Sachs.
[02:40:02.501 --> 02:40:03.061]  Uh, Goldman Sachs.
[02:40:03.562 --> 02:40:04.362]  My number one donor, right?
[02:40:04.382 --> 02:40:05.102]  It was all J.P.
[02:40:05.142 --> 02:40:05.402]  Morgan.
[02:40:05.462 --> 02:40:06.482]  It was all big banker stuff.
[02:40:08.122 --> 02:40:10.263]  And then you've got a bunch of boomers who are confused.
[02:40:10.383 --> 02:40:11.123]  Oh, he's a Marxist!
[02:40:11.163 --> 02:40:11.643]  He's a Marxist!
[02:40:12.404 --> 02:40:14.065]  Is he really a Marxist?
[02:40:14.085 --> 02:40:16.006]  Well, I mean, are any of these people really Marxist?
[02:40:16.066 --> 02:40:16.706]  Who knows?
[02:40:16.826 --> 02:40:25.931]  Because it doesn't really matter because the whole position is subversion, morphing your position to destroy the existing order.
[02:40:25.971 --> 02:40:26.371]  That's it.
[02:40:26.391 --> 02:40:30.773]  So if we're looking for explanations for why is society falling apart?
[02:40:31.113 --> 02:40:35.615]  Why are we losing control of our logistics and supply lines?
[02:40:35.695 --> 02:40:37.496]  And is it Marxist?
[02:40:37.556 --> 02:40:39.917]  Is it a bunch of idiot radicals on the street running around?
[02:40:39.937 --> 02:40:40.778]  Well, there's some of that.
[02:40:41.625 --> 02:40:49.690]  There's some of the, you know, Extinction Rebellion people laying out in the street with purple hair, but that's not really what Marxism and Socialism is.
[02:40:50.470 --> 02:41:03.537]  It's really professors and universities brainwashing your kids, and it's the Fortune 100, Fortune 500 promoting the ethical and social subversion to do what?
[02:41:04.258 --> 02:41:08.640]  To bring about the social disintegration of society.
[02:41:10.861 --> 02:41:12.862]  Why would they want to disintegrate?
[02:41:12.882 --> 02:41:18.706]  Because there's a higher goal, an overriding plan for austerity and for depopulation.
[02:41:18.746 --> 02:41:20.147]  That's the only way that this makes sense.
[02:41:20.207 --> 02:41:28.451]   If you understand it as warfare and subversion, and that's exactly what this book and the very writers from that system say, Right?
[02:41:28.491 --> 02:41:40.816]  The early Fabians, for example, I think there's a couple, Sidney Oliver, Beatrice Webb, her husband, Bernard Shaw, they were all big fans of infiltration and subversion.
[02:41:43.157 --> 02:41:46.598]  And they were very open about, well, just morph into whatever you need to be at the time.
[02:41:46.618 --> 02:41:48.138]  Right?
[02:41:48.198 --> 02:41:52.300]  Even Nantonio Gramsci, the famous Italian Marxist-Socialist.
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:54.241]  Remember, the long march through the institution.
[02:41:54.821 --> 02:41:55.121]  Right?
[02:41:55.201 --> 02:42:00.182]   When Marx's economic theories failed and the Worker Revolution failed, they just revised everything.
[02:42:00.282 --> 02:42:07.725]  Okay, well now let's just align ourselves with all of the existing institutions and just push for socialism.
[02:42:08.805 --> 02:42:17.108]  And it was never, this is the key point, it was never out of accord with the designs of very wealthy and elite nobility.
[02:42:18.209 --> 02:42:23.270]  So we're talking zillionaires, we're talking billionaires back then, you know, 150 years ago.
[02:42:24.691 --> 02:42:25.291]  Lord Milner.
[02:42:26.652 --> 02:42:27.392]  Lord Rothschild.
[02:42:28.433 --> 02:42:29.213]  David Rockefeller.
[02:42:30.874 --> 02:42:31.494]  Wall Street.
[02:42:32.875 --> 02:42:38.337]  All that money is the power behind all the various forms of Marxism-Socialism, including Marx himself.
[02:42:39.477 --> 02:42:41.218]  I mean, Marx is basically just a freeload.
[02:42:41.618 --> 02:42:42.679]  But who is paying for Marx?
[02:42:43.779 --> 02:42:44.580]  Well, Engels was.
[02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:46.300]  Engels was a wealthy stock owner.
[02:42:48.221 --> 02:42:52.903]  And again, people just cannot wrap their head around this, even though it's so well documented now.
[02:42:53.826 --> 02:43:01.912]  But this explains why, for example, you would have people at the various Federal Reserve Bank pushing and promoting Bolshevism.
[02:43:02.492 --> 02:43:04.954]  Well, what was the one of the ten planks of the Communist Party?
[02:43:04.974 --> 02:43:07.776]  Federal Reserve Banking System, right?
[02:43:08.056 --> 02:43:09.377]  Graduate Income Tax, etc.
[02:43:10.899 --> 02:43:17.123]  This is why that today we find Rockefeller Interest, Soros Interest, Ford Foundation, etc.
[02:43:17.483 --> 02:43:21.046]  all pushing and promoting all the exact same stuff that was pushed 100 years ago.
[02:43:22.242 --> 02:43:31.449]  Because it's by design, it is 100% known, it is 100% a plan, and it is not primarily Marxist teenagers and kids on the street.
[02:43:31.509 --> 02:43:35.171]  That's just like the furthest outer ring of this circle.
[02:43:37.833 --> 02:43:42.397]  The inner, inner core are these extremely wealthy people.
[02:43:45.018 --> 02:43:54.288]   This is precisely why, as Ratyu goes on to argue and demonstrate in his book, Socialism became the overall plan and strategy of the entirety of Europe.
[02:43:54.969 --> 02:43:58.411]  How did Europe get to be basically completely socialist?
[02:43:58.451 --> 02:44:00.953]  Well, you have the Kalergi Plan, which was socialist.
[02:44:01.393 --> 02:44:07.017]  Then you have the EU Common Market Plan in the 1930s, Sir Arthur Salter.
[02:44:07.877 --> 02:44:16.763]  And then you have Bilderberg, as I've covered here on the fourth hour, basically in the 50s, early on, planning to have the European Economic Union.
[02:44:16.803 --> 02:44:17.784]  That was planned at Bilderberg.
[02:44:19.261 --> 02:44:24.686]  And the implementation of a European-wide socialism to build what?
[02:44:25.646 --> 02:44:32.772]  The New World Order, the economic order, which will eventually be merged into the other continental union and order, right?
[02:44:33.913 --> 02:44:42.660]  In other words, liberal economics establishes the, of Adam Smith and whatnot, the alignment that establishes the international law, which still maintains nation states.
[02:44:43.061 --> 02:44:48.205]  Then international socialism tries to step in to say, now let's just disregard this, the nation state.
[02:44:48.812 --> 02:44:50.672]  Because that's a bourgeois entity!
[02:44:51.392 --> 02:44:58.894]  If we have international law, don't we need international governance and international state, world state?
[02:45:00.474 --> 02:45:01.194]  How do we get this?
[02:45:01.794 --> 02:45:14.576]  Through the promotion of completely open borders, complete destruction of existing cultural and religious boundaries, the removal of world religion, etc., and the removal of all territorial boundaries.
[02:45:16.177 --> 02:45:22.081]   That is the platform of the socialist movements which are essentially just
[02:45:22.081 --> 02:45:24.951]  various forms of Fabianism.
[02:45:24.951 --> 02:45:28.951]  Again, because it's a slow, gradualist model.
[02:45:29.693 --> 02:45:31.074]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:45:30.893 --> 02:45:37.213]   and really still utilize this strategy for the US because it's just too difficult to convert the US
[02:45:37.213 --> 02:45:39.412]  directly into Marxism.
[02:45:39.412 --> 02:45:42.293]   Don't go anywhere, when we come back in the final section, we're gonna get into it.
[02:45:42.293 --> 02:45:44.093]  Welcome back to the Oxygen Show.
[02:45:44.093 --> 02:45:46.773]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:45:46.773 --> 02:45:54.333]   I wanna remind you guys that I just did a really cool interview covering the notion of AI
[02:45:54.333 --> 02:45:55.772]  as summoning the demon.
[02:45:55.772 --> 02:45:59.853]   If you guys remember, I think that Elon Musk made that odd phrase not too long ago.
[02:45:59.766 --> 02:46:02.167]  I just had a really cool interview with a guy named Nick Hinton.
[02:46:02.187 --> 02:46:06.149]  And you can go watch that interview right there on my channel if you head to YouTube.
[02:46:06.209 --> 02:46:09.931]  It's just summoning the demon, technosis, chaos magic.
[02:46:09.971 --> 02:46:11.392]  I thought it was a really awesome interview.
[02:46:11.412 --> 02:46:17.695]  By the way, I'm almost at 100,000 over on YouTube, so if you want to help me hit that 100K, there's a lot of great stuff there.
[02:46:17.715 --> 02:46:25.835]   I know we don't want to really support that kind of stuff, but We want to use those platforms as long as we can before we get kind of banished.
[02:46:25.915 --> 02:46:32.120]  But I also have a Rockfin, which Paul Joseph Watson is now over on Rockfin, so I was really excited to see him over there.
[02:46:32.201 --> 02:46:41.488]  And if you're on Rockfin, you can subscribe to him and basically you get access to everybody, as well as everything over here on freeworldnews.tv or band.video.
[02:46:42.329 --> 02:46:59.883]   And we have to keep changing the URL because of all that censorship, but We were discussing the notion of the Fabian Conspiracy, and according to a historian and analyst that I brought to you, he notes that Fabianism is really the world's most influential social, political, and economic cultural movement.
[02:47:00.123 --> 02:47:07.728]  And it's that powerful because of its kind of semi-covert nature.
[02:47:07.868 --> 02:47:16.177]   Now, it's an existing public society, but it's also secret in the sense that It kind of isn't really out there, right?
[02:47:16.197 --> 02:47:21.861]  It's not really known as this powerful entity or it's more of an ideological thing, right?
[02:47:22.121 --> 02:47:41.426]   And we shouldn't look past that, though, because it's ideological, because the Fabian Society had support from very, very wealthy people, including the Rothschilds, including Lord Milner, the most famous probably Fabian socialist sort of granddaddy there in terms of Power and support and money.
[02:47:41.746 --> 02:47:52.992]  But if you're wondering what comes out of this, well, we get the British Economic Association, which was formerly the Royal Society of Economics.
[02:47:53.272 --> 02:47:59.295]  So the Royal Society itself is basically what's behind the Fabian Society.
[02:47:59.335 --> 02:48:12.907]   And out of the Fabian Society, we get the London School of Economics, which many prominent people I've graduated from and of course that probably is a funnel into things nowadays like the World Economic Forum and so forth.
[02:48:12.947 --> 02:48:22.973]  So this gradualist strategy of overcoming the firewalls of nation-state, of sovereign nations, etc.
[02:48:23.414 --> 02:48:25.375]  is what they call the permeation strategy.
[02:48:26.147 --> 02:48:31.208]  And this was something I think, if I recall, this was coined by George Bernard Shaw himself.
[02:48:31.248 --> 02:48:36.589]  He said, why don't we have a permeation strategy of permeating the existing institutions again?
[02:48:36.609 --> 02:48:39.510]  This is a reformed Marxism, some called it.
[02:48:40.730 --> 02:48:45.371]  And if you, the simple explanation of that is just infiltration.
[02:48:45.931 --> 02:48:48.352]  Infiltration and subversion ideologically.
[02:48:48.988 --> 02:48:55.556]  Into any of the existing structures that are, in any way, liberal or counter-revolutionary.
[02:48:55.596 --> 02:48:56.957]  Excuse me, revolutionary, right?
[02:48:56.977 --> 02:48:57.798]  Not counter-revolutionary.
[02:48:58.099 --> 02:48:58.719]  Revolutionary.
[02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:04.006]  And so, for example, George Bernard Shaw had this bizarre, blasphemous stained glass window.
[02:49:04.989 --> 02:49:10.572]  That he commissioned to be made to exemplify the Fabian ideology and approach.
[02:49:11.093 --> 02:49:13.714]  And really, it's kind of blasphemous, even though it's supposedly a joke.
[02:49:13.774 --> 02:49:17.336]  It's kind of blasphemous because you have a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:49:17.376 --> 02:49:20.578]  That's actually one of their symbols, the wolf in sheep's clothing.
[02:49:21.399 --> 02:49:24.540]  The Fabians are hammering out a new world order.
[02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:26.762]  They're on the anvil hammering out.
[02:49:26.822 --> 02:49:32.125]  So the hammer and sickle, you know, kind of imagery, the hand grasping the hammer.
[02:49:32.325 --> 02:49:34.086]  They're hammering out a new world order.
[02:49:35.163 --> 02:49:41.685]  And below them, a bunch of pious Marxists and socialists are worshipping their writings.
[02:49:43.825 --> 02:49:46.746]  I adjure you to look up the Fabian window, because there it is.
[02:49:46.786 --> 02:49:56.589]  You can see all the acolytes and worshippers down below, and then you have the elite Marxist socialists up top, right, hammering out the new world order.
[02:49:58.024 --> 02:50:02.785]  So remember, the New World Order is not totally, exclusively, primarily Marxist.
[02:50:03.125 --> 02:50:08.526]  Marx has a big, key role in getting us to NWO and Great Reset.
[02:50:08.906 --> 02:50:11.426]  But it's not primarily Marxism.
[02:50:13.127 --> 02:50:18.108]  Marx is just one of the kind of useful tools in the toolkit of the elite.
[02:50:19.008 --> 02:50:25.889]  And it proves to be a very powerful one in its various hardcore and gradual Fabian approaches.
[02:50:27.193 --> 02:50:33.980]  This is, again, what helps to explain kind of the figures like Obama or a kind of a Tony Blair, right?
[02:50:34.020 --> 02:50:37.403]  And Blair was famously very influenced by Fabian ideas.
[02:50:37.443 --> 02:50:42.588]  In fact, I think he was a big fan of this Fabian window, this stained glass window here.
[02:50:43.529 --> 02:50:58.910]   If I recall from my reading, it says, yeah, in 2006, Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was a known Fabian Society member, Said that a lot of the values of the Fabians and Bernard Shaw were the very valuable, very values of his Labor Party.
[02:50:58.950 --> 02:51:02.932]  Now, again, I'm not trying to play in a party politics as if Tories are all, they're the good guys.
[02:51:03.593 --> 02:51:07.095]  It's the same ideas in different game plans, right?
[02:51:07.115 --> 02:51:07.995]  Different strategies.
[02:51:08.315 --> 02:51:11.637]  And the same money power and the same elites behind the parties, right?
[02:51:12.618 --> 02:51:15.380]  Are behind both of this false dialectic.
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:18.942]  I'm not trying to say that this makes the fake conservatives good guy.
[02:51:19.002 --> 02:51:19.222]  No, no, no.
[02:51:20.491 --> 02:51:28.337]  We have to understand that there's this superstructure, there's these bigger players above these guys that fund these kinds of movements.
[02:51:28.557 --> 02:51:49.862]   And this is, as we know, from Quigley, from Professor Anthony Sutton, and from now, Yoann Ratouille, The Roundtree interest, Arrow Cadbury interest, the Rothschild interest, the Rockefeller interest, all of these continue even to this day to support the Fabian Society and its many projects.
[02:51:50.203 --> 02:51:51.225]  Again, remember, this is not...
[02:51:51.829 --> 02:52:08.456]  So much a power group as it is an idea group, an intellectual gathering of just kind of a bunch of sooths and blowhards pushing forward this idea of what they cloak as humanitarian concern for the workers and for the average man.
[02:52:08.496 --> 02:52:13.818]  And I'm sure they recruit a lot of sincere ideologues who care about workers and so forth.
[02:52:13.838 --> 02:52:19.661]  But really, this is a higher game strategy that's a technology or a tool of subversion.
[02:52:20.399 --> 02:52:23.401]  And I'm not trying to say that monopoly capital is good either.
[02:52:23.641 --> 02:52:28.645]  Monopoly capital is just as bad and just as subversive as these figures.
[02:52:28.665 --> 02:52:29.886]  That's why, who did he list?
[02:52:29.926 --> 02:52:34.349]  He lists all these monopoly capitalists as the guys that are the money behind Fabian socialism.
[02:52:34.950 --> 02:52:37.372]  And if you remember in Quigley's book, you get the same thing.
[02:52:37.412 --> 02:52:41.795]  There's a whole chapter where he talks about JP Morgan, Rockefellers, etc.
[02:52:41.955 --> 02:52:54.707]   Putting all the money into Liberal causes, socialist causes, leftist foundations, leftist NGOs, leftist magazines and publications throughout the 60s and 70s, even earlier.
[02:52:54.727 --> 02:52:56.487]  And why is that?
[02:52:56.547 --> 02:53:12.093]  Well, according to Quigley, it was because these interests saw liberalism, socialism, Marxism, any of those things as the most useful tools to change society, not for the better, for their interest.
[02:53:12.911 --> 02:53:17.492]  So again, if you're a committed Marxist-Socialist, my point here is just that you're being you.
[02:53:18.572 --> 02:53:25.013]  And all you need to do is look at today's global elite leaders, so-called, World Economic Forum, Klaus.
[02:53:25.733 --> 02:53:34.155]  They're basically saying the exact same things that the Fabian Society elite, which comes out of the Royal Society, were saying a hundred years ago.
[02:53:35.575 --> 02:53:37.316]  Exact same plan, exact same strategy.
[02:53:37.336 --> 02:53:41.355]   So when people are skeptics and they say, Well, it's not a long-term plan.
[02:53:41.635 --> 02:53:44.777]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:53:44.817 --> 02:53:45.137]  Really?
[02:53:45.197 --> 02:53:45.757]  Conspiracy theory?
[02:53:45.777 --> 02:53:52.540]  Well, how come they openly talked about it a hundred years ago, same Fabians, and now today's Fabians repeat the exact same thing?
[02:53:53.421 --> 02:53:54.061]  Klaus and Company.
[02:53:54.938 --> 02:53:57.039]  Now, I don't know a whole lot about Klaus himself.
[02:53:57.079 --> 02:54:00.741]  His background, a lot of people have kind of a little murky there.
[02:54:00.781 --> 02:54:14.368]  I know Johnny Vedmore has done a great essay where he went into the background of Klaus and found out, okay, yeah, we know Klaus was connected to Harvard and Kissinger, right, through this Harvard project idea to set up World Economic Forum basically out of Bilderberg.
[02:54:15.989 --> 02:54:18.890]  But would Klaus himself say he's a Fabian?
[02:54:18.930 --> 02:54:19.491]  Well, perhaps.
[02:54:19.511 --> 02:54:22.332]  I think a lot of people have seen the picture of Klaus.
[02:54:22.412 --> 02:54:23.753]  I assume it's a genuine photo.
[02:54:24.395 --> 02:54:26.057]  Where Klaus has, you know, linen in the back.
[02:54:26.077 --> 02:54:29.421]  He has a bust of linen up on his shelf.
[02:54:31.143 --> 02:54:32.385]  So I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:54:32.545 --> 02:54:36.190]  I feel confident that I'm sure Klaus really likes Fabian Socialist.
[02:54:37.251 --> 02:54:46.135]   And again, Fabian Socialist is a lot more amenable, a lot more favorable to Monopoly capitalism, and this helps us to understand, you know, places like China, right?
[02:54:46.155 --> 02:54:49.678]  Which is basically big state capitalism, right?
[02:54:49.978 --> 02:55:00.425]  And it, you know, there's a great picture that came out some years ago of some square in China where it was like a giant Gucci ad, and then it has like the hammer and sickle right above it.
[02:55:01.125 --> 02:55:14.311]   I mean, they weren't connected, but it was like, wait a minute, we got Gucci, which is like, you know, big capitalist, Iconography, and then we've got the hammer and sickle and a giant red, you know, symbol right above it.
[02:55:15.771 --> 02:55:17.572]  And so, is this a contradiction?
[02:55:17.612 --> 02:55:18.452]  No, it's not a contradiction.
[02:55:18.472 --> 02:55:44.314]   It makes perfect sense, because of the types of things that are well documented by scholars that are not welcome in the mainstream, precisely because they're on to what's really going on, like Johan Ratju, like Professor Anthony Sutton, and like one of their own, Dr. Carol Quigley, Again, vindicating and proving all of this beyond any shadow of a doubt with hundreds of pure academic scholarship and research.

[02:56:14.116 --> 02:56:24.196]  Thank you guys so much.
[02:56:24.278 --> 02:56:25.779]  It's really a philosophical question.
[02:56:25.819 --> 02:56:26.959]  It's hard to answer directly.
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:27.820]  Let's see.
[02:56:28.320 --> 02:56:31.943]  How drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers game?
[02:56:32.783 --> 02:56:35.305]  How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband?
[02:56:35.705 --> 02:56:37.406]  Well, the answer in all cases is very.
[02:56:37.907 --> 02:56:38.427]  Extremely.
[02:56:38.867 --> 02:56:41.429]  So thoroughly and so totally that it's hard to put into words.
[02:56:41.789 --> 02:56:47.233]  So instead of describing the dishonesty of the New York Times with conventional adjectives, we'll give you a specific example.
[02:56:47.773 --> 02:56:48.854]  Because we think it tells you more.
[02:56:48.874 --> 02:56:57.481]  So last week, the paper told us that the best-selling book in the United States was a title called, I'm Glad My Mom Died, by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy.
[02:56:58.122 --> 02:56:59.283]  But that was not true.
[02:56:59.363 --> 02:57:01.985]  That book was not the best-selling book in America.
[02:57:02.085 --> 02:57:09.471]  In fact, the best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds, written by Alex Jones.
[02:57:09.992 --> 02:57:13.695]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[02:57:14.235 --> 02:57:20.920]  Jeannette McCurdy, whatever her merits, we have no idea, sold 34,686 copies of her book.
[02:57:21.421 --> 02:57:24.203]  So Alex Jones sold a lot more books.
[02:57:24.283 --> 02:57:26.625]  Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country.
[02:57:26.645 --> 02:57:29.507]  But the New York Times lied about that because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[02:57:29.527 --> 02:57:34.191]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[02:57:34.631 --> 02:57:39.315]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons of mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[02:57:39.675 --> 02:57:40.836]  But Alex Jones is worse!
[02:57:41.396 --> 02:57:42.297]  He's a mental patient.
[02:57:42.337 --> 02:57:43.238]  No one listens to him.
[02:57:44.650 --> 02:57:45.470]  So they lied about his book.
[02:57:46.171 --> 02:57:47.071]  What else are they lying about?
[02:57:47.671 --> 02:57:48.071]  You wonder.
[02:57:48.732 --> 02:57:55.774]  Since you mentioned the great recent The War of the World that you championed, and I really appreciate you reading it, it's mainly, it was easy to write, it's their quotes, it's their battle plan.
[02:57:56.155 --> 02:57:58.936]  What if people would have read Mein Kampf that Hitler wrote?
[02:57:59.376 --> 02:58:00.876]  Everything he said in the book, he did.
[02:58:01.136 --> 02:58:02.457]  Well, this is their Mein Kampf.
[02:58:02.657 --> 02:58:04.258]  This is their admissions right here.
[02:58:04.298 --> 02:58:05.258]  This is their confessions.
[02:58:05.518 --> 02:58:07.339]  That's why I call it the blueprint of the Death Star.
[02:58:07.879 --> 02:58:09.240]  No, listen, here's the beauty of the book.
[02:58:09.621 --> 02:58:10.882]  You actually quote them at length.
[02:58:10.902 --> 02:58:16.926]  You take a couple of the top books, you take a couple of the top thinkers, you tie it all together, and this is what people have to understand.
[02:58:17.227 --> 02:58:20.930]  Look, once you read this, you'll understand what we're up against, okay?
[02:58:21.130 --> 02:58:26.074]  You'll understand exactly what this apparatus, you know, what Alex calls it, the Death Star.
[02:58:26.314 --> 02:58:27.655]  But you understand what we're up against.
[02:58:27.695 --> 02:58:28.855]  And we're not going to back off this.
[02:58:28.875 --> 02:58:29.696]  We can't back off it.
[02:58:29.716 --> 02:58:32.417]  The United States is actually the centerpiece of this battle.
[02:58:32.657 --> 02:58:39.300]  Because they understand, just like in the Revolutionary War, if they can take the liberty and freedom of American citizens, they can take it anywhere.
[02:58:39.661 --> 02:58:41.021]  And that's why you have to fight back.
[02:58:41.061 --> 02:58:43.943]  And by the way, Alex, I not just read it, I tell everybody, get a pen.
[02:58:43.963 --> 02:58:45.283]  I always get my great pens here.
[02:58:45.583 --> 02:58:47.784]  I had my pen and I'm underlining everything.
[02:58:47.965 --> 02:58:48.885]  And here's the beauty of it.
[02:58:49.105 --> 02:58:50.206]  You footnote everything.
[02:58:50.246 --> 02:58:51.886]  This is not Alex Jones's opinions.
[02:58:52.307 --> 02:58:59.163]   What Alex Jones's team has done is pulled it all together It's all referenced right there.
[02:58:59.203 --> 02:59:00.224]  You can go to a footnote.
[02:59:00.465 --> 02:59:02.387]  I know you've got an online site about it, too.
[02:59:02.427 --> 02:59:05.912]  That's why I think Tony Lyons and the guys at Skyhorse did such a great job.
[02:59:05.952 --> 02:59:06.333]  But listen.
[02:59:06.966 --> 02:59:12.128]  Once you read this book, you understand why the Alex Joneses and the Steve Bannons are not going to back off.
[02:59:12.148 --> 02:59:13.729]  There's all kind of other things we could do.
[02:59:13.749 --> 02:59:15.590]  There's all kind of other things Trump could do.
[02:59:15.610 --> 02:59:17.330]  There's all kind of other things Tucker Carlson could do.
[02:59:17.630 --> 02:59:18.651]  We're all in this fight.
