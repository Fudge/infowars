[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018, most people did nothing to defend
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.280]  Alex Jones or Infowars.
[00:09.280 --> 00:16.120]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary
[00:16.120 --> 00:17.120]  evil.
[00:17.120 --> 00:22.880]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone, and without any recourse, they
[00:22.880 --> 00:25.080]  are about to get much worse.
[00:25.080 --> 00:31.560]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system, brought to you
[00:31.560 --> 00:35.840]  by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[00:35.840 --> 00:40.480]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.840]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name, and the parents never sought a retraction,
[00:45.840 --> 00:52.440]  Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.200]  by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.120]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents, and the legal team is comprised of highly
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.320]  politicized members of the anti-gun lobby, who have admitted their intention is to silence
[01:09.320 --> 01:11.040]  Alex Jones.
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.320]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example the
[01:16.320 --> 01:22.220]  school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional
[01:22.220 --> 01:25.160]  distress, but it only gets worse.
[01:25.160 --> 01:30.640]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor
[01:30.640 --> 01:34.480]  Conspiracy Theory, which is demonstrably false.
[01:34.480 --> 01:40.160]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video
[01:40.160 --> 01:45.920]  content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of
[01:45.920 --> 01:47.560]  Sandy Hook.
[01:47.560 --> 01:53.960]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11, and over the course of
[01:53.960 --> 01:59.360]  seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[01:59.360 --> 02:04.280]  We know this because it's all part of the public record, but these radical judges do
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.080]  not care about evidence.
[02:06.080 --> 02:11.280]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[02:11.280 --> 02:18.040]  They're already, apparently, I've heard that the plaintiffs' lawyers are complaining about
[02:18.040 --> 02:19.040]  the case.
[02:19.040 --> 02:21.240]  That's how corrupt these plaintiffs' lawyers are.
[02:21.240 --> 02:26.560]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take
[02:26.560 --> 02:31.440]  away other people's political rights, and I find it disgusting what they've done.
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.920]  And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[02:35.920 --> 02:39.280]  I can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is, and yet they pretended
[02:39.280 --> 02:41.400]  that he didn't, why?
[02:41.400 --> 02:44.360]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[02:44.360 --> 02:50.840]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty
[02:50.840 --> 02:56.720]  without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence, which is worse treatment than anyone
[02:56.720 --> 03:03.400]  has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone, and their excuse for
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.200]  this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.920]  incriminating evidence that they imagined must exist.
[03:12.920 --> 03:19.000]  Whatever that mysterious, unspecified evidence is, both judges have stripped Jones of his
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.040]  first amendment right, but Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[03:24.040 --> 03:30.440]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.160]  with pedophiles.
[03:32.160 --> 03:38.280]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda praising the state's authority and advising parents
[03:38.280 --> 03:44.040]  that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[03:44.040 --> 03:49.640]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words first amendment and
[03:49.640 --> 03:56.240]  free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[03:56.240 --> 03:59.000]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.120]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional
[04:03.120 --> 04:07.800]  trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[04:07.800 --> 04:13.800]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.640]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones
[04:19.640 --> 04:26.880]  or InfoWars unfairly, and any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.960]  by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[04:30.960 --> 04:36.440]  Alex Jones was canceled from social media in 2018 and is now being canceled from the
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.240]  U.S. Bill of Rights and Constitution, and because of our complacency, everyone else
[04:42.240 --> 04:43.240]  is next.
[04:43.240 --> 04:48.720]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent
[04:48.720 --> 04:50.760]  until proven guilty.
[04:50.760 --> 04:55.920]  It relied upon the burden of proof, and it was pretty good.
[04:55.920 --> 04:59.440]  Learning for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:59.440 --> 05:06.160]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[05:06.160 --> 05:10.640]  flat footed because of InfoWars and because of your support.
[05:10.640 --> 05:15.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[05:15.320 --> 05:20.600]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[05:20.600 --> 05:23.240]  like you've never done before.
[05:23.240 --> 05:27.760]  We have come so far together, please help keep us from the year, we're under massive
[05:27.760 --> 05:30.640]  attack right now, but we're going to win with your help.
[05:30.640 --> 05:33.960]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[05:33.960 --> 05:37.360]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[05:37.360 --> 05:39.680]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[05:39.680 --> 05:45.240]  The great reset and the war for the world available right now at infoworkstore.com.
[05:45.240 --> 05:47.920]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[05:47.920 --> 05:51.320]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[05:51.320 --> 05:55.920]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[05:55.920 --> 05:58.320]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[05:58.320 --> 06:24.360]  Get the great reset at infoworkstore.com.
[06:33.080 --> 06:38.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, July 27th, 2022.
[06:38.800 --> 06:44.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled in full war studios in Austin,
[06:44.200 --> 06:48.080]  Texas, transmitting and broadcasting worldwide.
[06:48.080 --> 06:50.520]  Thank you again for joining us today.
[06:50.520 --> 06:54.720]  We're living inside the new world order now and everything they're doing to us, as I told
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.360]  you four years ago with the platforming and censorship is going to be done to you and
[06:58.360 --> 07:00.880]  now they're announcing it is.
[07:00.880 --> 07:07.640]  I have ABC news, I have NBC news, I have CNBC, I have Reuters all saying Jones has been found
[07:07.640 --> 07:15.120]  guilty of defamation and intentional distress and all this other BS and now a jury will
[07:15.120 --> 07:21.480]  decide how much he pays and they're just shoehorning in this system that they've been
[07:21.480 --> 07:27.600]  using in CPS and the family courts now into all of the courts where all due process is
[07:27.600 --> 07:36.320]  erased and that's why they're now running for office, CPS lawyers, CPS judges, CPS operatives
[07:36.320 --> 07:39.400]  that have been on the side of taking children for office.
[07:39.400 --> 07:44.480]  That's who Soros is funding as judges like the judge here in Austin, Texas that is no
[07:44.480 --> 07:49.800]  judge at all in my view, but someone will go down the history books as the example of
[07:49.800 --> 07:56.280]  a kangaroo court of the weaponized judiciary of a show trial and she just sat there yesterday
[07:56.280 --> 07:59.880]  four times when I saw it and I was on there half a day where I was told it was in the
[07:59.880 --> 08:03.960]  news she said more and more to the jury he's guilty remember that he's guilty and he's
[08:03.960 --> 08:08.160]  not sorry and he's bad.
[08:08.160 --> 08:13.560]  That's like something out of North Korea, but this is what they're doing, this is what
[08:13.560 --> 08:19.040]  they're engaged in and then she allowed like 20 news cameras outside down the hall there
[08:19.040 --> 08:25.640]  on the top floor of the courthouse and everybody's out there talking and yelling at me and screaming
[08:25.640 --> 08:30.600]  you're guilty Alex Jones, you're going down, we have video of it all, but then I walk out
[08:30.600 --> 08:36.040]  during a 20 minute break and I talk to the press and she comes running down the hall
[08:36.040 --> 08:39.920]  of the deputies and she's just coming to the chambers and she says you're not allowed
[08:39.920 --> 08:47.840]  to talk on this floor and on the other floors you got to go to the basement and then we
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.800]  went down to the basement, the basement is closed.
[08:52.800 --> 08:56.720]  Isn't that hilarious ladies and gentlemen and there's some footage of me just calmly
[08:56.720 --> 09:03.320]  talking to the bank of cameras and media that you can't see because they're aimed at me.
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.600]  This is the massive thought crime that I engaged in ladies and gentlemen and Chep Smith with
[09:08.600 --> 09:14.840]  his failed show over at CNBC comes in and says Jones is already guilty, doesn't mention
[09:14.840 --> 09:22.320]  by a judge and now we'll decide how much he owes the families and they're saying $150
[09:22.320 --> 09:34.080]  million, wow, very, very interesting, $150 million, if you go back over six, seven, eight
[09:34.080 --> 09:38.200]  years that's how much money we brought in from selling products but that's not how you
[09:38.200 --> 09:43.160]  pay for the bandwidth, the crew, the legal, all the stuff that money all goes away, $150
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.240]  million didn't want it used to be but they picked that number because now they're going
[09:47.240 --> 09:51.760]  to go next week and describe my net worth and they have experts that are going to tell
[09:51.760 --> 09:58.520]  you I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars even though ladies and gentlemen if I sold
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.920]  my house and sold everything I've got I would have a couple million dollars but the point
[10:03.920 --> 10:08.640]  is I don't even care about that, I care about freedom and justice and they are wrecking
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.120]  it and they are murdering it right in front of us but they're doing it across the board
[10:13.120 --> 10:19.240]  across, not just the U.S. but across the world it's the exact same plan, the judges, the
[10:19.240 --> 10:25.680]  district attorneys, the county attorneys, the U.S. attorneys, the state attorney generals,
[10:25.680 --> 10:32.240]  the majority of them are now Soros, hardcore leftists and they know this is their criminal
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.440]  takeover and they have confidence and they believe they're going to beat the American
[10:36.440 --> 10:39.960]  people and they believe they're going to make us all their slaves and treat us all like
[10:39.960 --> 10:46.160]  poor families where they take their children away and basically sell them into the system.
[10:46.160 --> 10:49.400]  This is nothing but human trafficking writ large in my view, that's why the borders
[10:49.400 --> 10:57.120]  are wide open, they found that Obama, Senate reports six years ago that Obama did traffic
[10:57.120 --> 11:01.600]  tens of thousands of children into sex slavery knowingly.
[11:01.600 --> 11:06.280]  So that's what this whole thing is about ladies and gentlemen and that's where this
[11:06.280 --> 11:11.680]  is all going, these are very dangerous gangsters, these are very serious people, they've broken
[11:11.680 --> 11:16.440]  the southern border completely and are smuggling millions across every few months, hundreds
[11:16.440 --> 11:20.440]  of thousands of children disappearing, I've witnessed them giving babies to people that
[11:20.440 --> 11:24.120]  aren't their parents with no paperwork at airports, we've shown you the footage, I
[11:24.120 --> 11:31.280]  mean what the South Texas looks like is about to be the whole country and they have judges
[11:31.280 --> 11:38.560]  like this lady presiding over the tank down and just the oh, you don't get jury trials
[11:38.560 --> 11:44.080]  anymore, you're just guilty because the judge says and then the jury is told you're guilty
[11:44.080 --> 11:48.320]  and then how much trouble are you in?
[11:48.320 --> 11:52.040]  And I've now learned because I didn't watch much of the jury selection Monday that a
[11:52.040 --> 11:57.520]  bunch of people including a lot of minorities and people were saying, well I think as a
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.040]  juror I'm supposed to decide if he's guilty, struck you're not on here and remember she
[12:02.040 --> 12:09.600]  put an order out saying I am not allowed about the First Amendment or to say I'm innocent
[12:09.600 --> 12:14.440]  and my lawyer will be sanctioned if he says I'm innocent.
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.880]  So you go in, they make you come to court and then they say you've got to say you're
[12:18.880 --> 12:23.760]  guilty while I'm not going along with it, can't mention the First Amendment, can't say you're
[12:23.760 --> 12:30.840]  innocent and yesterday she did a ruling that all the videos where I said hey, I covered
[12:30.840 --> 12:34.880]  all sides of Sandy Hook, I'm sorry it hurt your feelings, I think it happened because
[12:34.880 --> 12:40.400]  some of the anomalies weren't true, I've been saying that since 2015, she said you can't
[12:40.400 --> 12:46.880]  say that because they've got to rig everything because what they say I did, this campaign
[12:46.880 --> 12:53.280]  of lies that's making money off Sandy Hook when their evidence against me is 24 minutes
[12:53.280 --> 12:59.840]  of videos and I have a right to say those things that I said in the context.
[12:59.840 --> 13:05.720]  So ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to not really get into that much more this hour,
[13:05.720 --> 13:12.440]  Robert Barnes is coming in, we'll get more into it then but it really is incredible to
[13:12.440 --> 13:15.320]  watch how they're trying to deceive you but you don't tune in to just hear about what's
[13:15.320 --> 13:19.560]  happened now, it shows even though this affects everybody, it's a microcosm, you tune in to
[13:19.560 --> 13:24.120]  get the latest on what's breaking down in the world and it is insane, I could spend
[13:24.120 --> 13:29.680]  the next hour on an 11 minute speech Biden put out from the White House officially, people
[13:29.680 --> 13:33.000]  thought it was a deep fake when it first hit Twitter yesterday and they went and checked
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.680]  it, no it's on the White House website, completely insane, in 11 minutes he bleaks six times,
[13:40.680 --> 13:48.040]  I mean he looks like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese or something, I mean ladies
[13:48.040 --> 13:52.560]  and gentlemen, this looks like the intro to a horror movie or something where body snatchers
[13:52.560 --> 13:58.560]  have taken over, so this happens in human civilization, it normally collapses civilization
[13:58.560 --> 14:03.920]  for at least a time, when the good people let crazy's get in charge, we let them be
[14:03.920 --> 14:09.240]  in control and they always start assaulting reality and assaulting common sense and assaulting
[14:09.240 --> 14:15.240]  due process and assaulting logic and people keep asking until everything disintegrates
[14:15.240 --> 14:19.080]  and that is now the point we've entered at every level, they've now said that recessions
[14:19.080 --> 14:22.680]  and depressions are actually good for you, they're now officially saying the school lunch
[14:22.680 --> 14:27.000]  program will be bugs, it already is in Canada, the government's rolling out bugs is the new
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.200]  food, they're banning beef all over Europe, 90 plus percent of the cows and it's only
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.960]  going to get worse faster, this is the big move, everything else up until now was beta,
[14:37.960 --> 14:42.680]  they're making their move now to take your right to self defense, to take your right
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.640]  to do process, to take your right to not pay for tens of millions of illegals pouring in
[14:46.640 --> 14:52.200]  after the globalists collapse their countries with two plus years of lock-downs, but when
[14:52.200 --> 14:57.600]  we come back the really, really big news that ties together with the accelerated design collapse,
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.800]  the UN has announced, the head of the UN has announced and the head of the World Health
[15:01.800 --> 15:08.800]  Organization has announced the puppet of Soros, the puppet of Bill Gates, the UN is directing
[15:08.800 --> 15:12.920]  social media under the global emergency and they have agreements, so you're going to see
[15:12.920 --> 15:18.040]  UN pop-ups again, remember what happened during the Pfizer shots causing heart attacks and
[15:18.040 --> 15:21.120]  the doctor said, yeah, this young college student in great shape had a heart attack
[15:21.120 --> 15:25.120]  from it, they said, even though it's true, it's still hurtful, they keep others from
[15:25.120 --> 15:30.720]  taking it, you're not allowed to be on Facebook, your account is banned, that was a Yahoo announcement
[15:30.720 --> 15:36.680]  from the UN, so the UN is taking direct control, they called for global censorship of all of
[15:36.680 --> 15:44.320]  their opposition today, ahead of the monkeypox and the Marburg virus, they say it's a bowl
[15:44.320 --> 15:48.920]  alike, so new lock-downs are coming, we've got that whole stack here, head of the Federal
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.640]  Reserve saying, recession's good for you and just so much more gaslighting, oh and they're
[15:53.640 --> 16:21.640]  officially naming at the Federal level, rest-feeding, man-feeding.
[16:21.640 --> 16:26.520]  We have come so far together, please help keep us from the air, we're under massive
[16:26.520 --> 16:30.440]  attack right now, but we're going to win with your help, we're going to overcome this with
[16:30.440 --> 16:36.120]  your help and with God's blessing, please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book,
[16:36.120 --> 16:40.000]  many many many years of research have gone into this, the great reset and the war for
[16:40.000 --> 16:46.640]  the world available right now at infoworkstore.com, there's also signed copies available as well.
[16:46.640 --> 16:50.080]  We've got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching
[16:50.080 --> 16:54.680]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because

[18:08.480 --> 18:12.600]  bringing you amazing products that really work, so we looked at the supplement market
[18:12.600 --> 18:18.120]  that we find a lot of our operations with and we said what are the best selling natural
[18:18.120 --> 18:21.480]  healthy anti-fat weight loss products that are out there.
[18:21.480 --> 18:26.760]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all have the same ingredients in common that is
[18:26.760 --> 18:27.760]  in this product.
[18:27.760 --> 18:35.240]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[18:35.240 --> 18:40.120]  known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body.

[18:55.360 --> 18:59.520]  Infowarsstore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[18:59.520 --> 19:04.040]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer or
[19:04.040 --> 19:08.880]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[19:08.880 --> 19:09.880]  profiles.
[19:09.880 --> 19:10.880]  You see it every year.
[19:10.880 --> 19:13.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.800]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[19:15.800 --> 19:21.360]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  this and knowing this.
[19:26.000 --> 19:31.600]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[19:31.600 --> 19:36.920]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[19:36.920 --> 19:37.920]  your money.
[19:37.920 --> 19:42.600]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[19:42.600 --> 19:49.760]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com
[19:49.760 --> 20:18.480]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[20:44.640 --> 20:48.960]  Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus.
[20:48.960 --> 20:51.960]  And can fuel the outbreak.
[20:51.960 --> 20:59.480]  As we have seen with COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly online.
[20:59.480 --> 21:06.280]  So we call on all social media platforms, tech companies and news organizations to work
[21:06.280 --> 21:11.760]  with us to prevent and counter harmful information.
[21:11.760 --> 21:16.760]  They did this 32 months ago when they launched the last major phase of the takeover.
[21:16.760 --> 21:21.080]  So when you hear world famine worse than any time in history, Americans worse off than
[21:21.080 --> 21:24.760]  any time since the depression because of COVID.
[21:24.760 --> 21:29.440]  No, it's because of them launching the fear, them launching the poison shot.
[21:29.440 --> 21:33.560]  All of it shows the statistics are they're killing us.
[21:33.560 --> 21:34.760]  So here's the New York Times.
[21:34.760 --> 21:37.000]  What to know about the Marburg virus disease?
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.800]  Oh, it's like Ebola.
[21:38.800 --> 21:43.320]  Look out, it's popped up all over different parts of Asia supposedly.
[21:43.320 --> 21:52.640]  ABC News, John declares first ever outbreak of Ebola like Marburg virus disease.
[21:52.640 --> 21:55.280]  Now we got to lock everything down again.
[21:55.280 --> 22:00.400]  LA County may reinstate mass mandate, but some cities are already pledging to be defiant.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.200]  Yes, phase two is coming.
[22:02.200 --> 22:03.200]  Stop it.
[22:03.200 --> 22:07.440]  Member of European Parliament labels COVID vaccine coercion, worst crime ever committed
[22:07.440 --> 22:10.120]  in humanity.
[22:10.120 --> 22:16.200]  That's from unknown causes are now the leading killer in Alberta, Canada following the rollout
[22:16.200 --> 22:17.920]  of the experimental vaccine.
[22:17.920 --> 22:22.280]  Similar numbers all over the world.
[22:22.280 --> 22:23.280]  Coming up, we'll play the clip.
[22:23.280 --> 22:28.960]  Tucker Carlson points out with mainline studies that women are having record level menstrual
[22:28.960 --> 22:29.960]  problems.
[22:29.960 --> 22:34.240]  In fact, women in the UK are missing two thirds of their periods suddenly.
[22:34.240 --> 22:35.240]  Yep.
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.560]  I can be having babies ever again.
[22:38.560 --> 22:41.840]  Miners lost $3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic.
[22:41.840 --> 22:45.240]  Women in Gen Z saw the biggest losses, but it wasn't a pandemic.
[22:45.240 --> 22:46.720]  It was a shutdown.
[22:46.720 --> 22:48.720]  Destroy the infrastructure.
[22:48.720 --> 22:55.360]  FDA officials warn of brain swelling, vision loss in minors using puberty blockers, but
[22:55.360 --> 22:57.760]  it's okay.
[22:57.760 --> 23:03.960]  Billionaires made $3.3 trillion during the pandemic and up to pay for everyone's vaccine.
[23:03.960 --> 23:06.880]  And it goes on and on from there.
[23:06.880 --> 23:09.960]  Miners hack fly brains and control them remotely.
[23:09.960 --> 23:15.040]  What do you think they're doing to us?
[23:15.040 --> 23:20.640]  This powerful report, all these top scientists confirming nanotech in the Pfizer Moderna shots,
[23:20.640 --> 23:27.040]  that's coming up as I mentioned a little bit later in the transmission.
[23:27.040 --> 23:29.640]  But first, I wanted to move into this.
[23:29.640 --> 23:35.320]  Remember, I said two years ago, two years ago, that if the economic collapse continued
[23:35.320 --> 23:38.880]  with lockdowns, you'd have worldwide starvation, the worst you've ever seen in cannibalism
[23:38.880 --> 23:41.920]  in all major studies would explode.
[23:41.920 --> 23:43.600]  Look at these headlines.
[23:43.600 --> 23:49.600]  Biden economic advisor claims U.S. is far better than any other countries where there's famine.
[23:49.600 --> 23:51.160]  Wow.
[23:51.160 --> 23:59.320]  Inflation hits New York City with bacon, egg, and cheese exploding in prices.
[23:59.320 --> 24:04.160]  And the New York Times says cannibalism is a good thing, has been part of a good thing
[24:04.160 --> 24:07.720]  in history, that we should embrace cannibalism.
[24:07.720 --> 24:09.720]  They say cannibalism has a time and place.
[24:09.720 --> 24:11.680]  This is the President of the New York Times.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.920]  Some recent books, films and shows suggest that the time is now.
[24:14.920 --> 24:16.520]  Can you stomach it?
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.960]  They say for the carbon footprint to be lowered, we start eating the bodies of the dead.
[24:21.960 --> 24:25.640]  All dehumanizing you, all training you to accept any type of people.
[24:25.640 --> 24:27.760]  Hey, you don't get a jury trial.
[24:27.760 --> 24:29.400]  You're just found guilty by a judge.
[24:29.400 --> 24:33.040]  Hey, you get checked by the TSA, but the illegal aliens don't.
[24:33.040 --> 24:39.120]  Hey, just get used to all the checks and balances, all the protections being thrown out.
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.560]  Here's the New York Times, a taste for cannibalism.
[24:44.560 --> 24:48.160]  Increasingly desperate Alex Jones says he will kill and eat his neighbors.
[24:48.160 --> 24:57.160]  And I said, this is satire, a modest proposal, famous, most famous piece of satire ever.
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.840]  But I said, I'm serious, this is where the world's going.
[24:59.840 --> 25:02.440]  This continues and they're going to push cannibalism.
[25:02.440 --> 25:03.760]  Predict it at all.
[25:03.760 --> 25:11.600]  Remember, two years ago, two years ago, here it is, Canada's snack foods now made with
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.440]  crickets is primary ingredient and they're rolling them out in the school lunch programs.
[25:16.440 --> 25:18.080]  You will eat some bugs.
[25:18.080 --> 25:21.440]  And FEMA says, get prepared now, there may not be enough food soon.
[25:21.440 --> 25:24.840]  But we're cooks and bad, we sell the highest quality, trouble food at the lowest prices
[25:24.840 --> 25:26.840]  at PrepareToday.com.
[25:26.840 --> 25:30.840]  And it gets more insane.
[25:30.840 --> 25:35.680]  Yellen, recession doesn't mean what you think it means, it's now a good thing.
[25:35.680 --> 25:39.240]  Big zero hedge article on that.
[25:39.240 --> 25:44.680]  And they continue to gaslight everybody, AP instructs the news media to avoid certain
[25:44.680 --> 25:48.960]  words from referring to transgender issues and the encyclopedias are all changing the
[25:48.960 --> 25:52.000]  terms now to get rid of man and woman.
[25:52.000 --> 25:53.000]  That ties into this.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.240]  You think I'm joking?
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.640]  The federal government has now come out with guidelines a few months ago calling it chest
[25:59.640 --> 26:00.640]  feeding.
[26:00.640 --> 26:01.640]  That's not enough.
[26:01.640 --> 26:05.720]  Now the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine advocating hospitals use the term father's
[26:05.720 --> 26:06.720]  milk.
[26:06.720 --> 26:09.560]  You're like, that's insane.
[26:09.560 --> 26:13.760]  It's about getting you trained to accept total and complete insanity.
[26:13.760 --> 26:16.000]  compilation of videos on infowars.com.
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.560]  Biden's energy secretary has a new statement now admits being obsessed with green transition
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.720]  that that's why they're cutting our power off.
[26:24.720 --> 26:29.040]  See how that all works.
[26:29.040 --> 26:34.640]  See how the new world order operates.
[26:34.640 --> 26:41.680]  But the good news is humanity is waking up very, very fast.
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.920]  It's number one on seven of the charts.
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.120]  It's now number 52 as of last time I checked an hour ago of books in the world.
[26:50.120 --> 26:51.120]  It goes to number one.
[26:51.120 --> 26:52.600]  It'll be the number one book in the world.
[26:52.600 --> 26:55.560]  It doesn't come out until late August, but it's being printed as we speak.
[26:55.560 --> 26:57.760]  It'll be shipping out in late August.
[26:57.760 --> 27:02.360]  I don't normally support Amazon, but when we send it to number one, and again, I will
[27:02.360 --> 27:05.320]  get some of that funding and it'll be dumped right into infowars.
[27:05.320 --> 27:08.160]  We're also selling the book and signing copies of infowars.com.
[27:08.160 --> 27:14.200]  But the big issue is Yvonne Harari, the high priest, the World Health Organization, gives
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.600]  his book away on Amazon as part of a grant telling you humans are over.
[27:18.600 --> 27:20.120]  The new world order is taking over.
[27:20.120 --> 27:23.560]  He's been number two on average.
[27:23.560 --> 27:31.640]  We're now number one in media studies, in history, in all of these other key charts.
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.400]  Let me show you some of those charts here that I've printed off.
[27:34.400 --> 27:38.920]  So you can see this here for yourself.
[27:38.920 --> 27:46.160]  Again, this is Amazon bestsellers, number one in history, a head of sapiens, his book
[27:46.160 --> 27:47.160]  he gives away.
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.440]  Of course, nothing's for free to teach you their new religion.
[27:52.440 --> 27:54.680]  It's like Christians will hand out bibles.
[27:54.680 --> 27:55.680]  They hand out their bibles.
[27:55.680 --> 27:59.400]  Do you want to know the whole enemy battle plan?
[27:59.400 --> 28:03.600]  Go to infowars.com and get a copy there if you really want to support us as we get half
[28:03.600 --> 28:07.520]  the money of each sell there, or we get a couple bucks from each sell on Amazon, but
[28:07.520 --> 28:12.240]  I want to send them both to number one, and so please go to Amazon and get the great
[28:12.240 --> 28:13.240]  reason today.
[28:13.240 --> 28:16.280]  It's really freaking them out.
[28:16.280 --> 28:20.520]  It's going to go number one unless they pull it, and if they do that, it'll just even
[28:20.520 --> 28:21.680]  blow up their face more.
[28:21.680 --> 28:31.240]  Alice's War still number two on the Apple charts for pre-order, it drops on Friday.
[28:31.240 --> 28:35.400]  I did not make the film, and it shows me in a good light, a bad light, a real light, but
[28:35.400 --> 28:38.320]  it is powerful and exposes the New World Order.
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.440]  That is just a mirror of the people and how awake they are, and how folks understand that
[28:43.440 --> 28:47.040]  the main enemy's the New World Order, and if you want the blueprint of how they're attacking
[28:47.040 --> 28:50.520]  you, their playbook, and how to stop them, you need the great reset in the war for the

[28:56.960 --> 29:04.800]  The globalist great reset, or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being
[29:04.800 --> 29:09.520]  caught flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[29:09.520 --> 29:14.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of

[31:59.480 --> 32:04.840]  The globalists are fighting around the clock to destroy the family, to destroy heterosexual
[32:04.840 --> 32:10.000]  relationships, to annihilate our marriages and the studies are all clear, the number one
[32:10.000 --> 32:16.800]  cause of marital splits is that there is problems in the bedroom and the number one issue men
[32:16.800 --> 32:19.760]  have is erectile dysfunction.
[32:19.760 --> 32:23.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, the left makes big jokes about this because they don't want people
[32:23.440 --> 32:28.280]  having lasting good love and relationships, they want to break up society and we are so

[33:00.560 --> 33:19.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:19.280 --> 33:26.400]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from Austin, Texas,
[33:26.400 --> 33:30.120]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:30.120 --> 33:40.400]  There's been a number of studies, New York Times just did one about menstruating cycles
[33:40.400 --> 33:43.560]  and how that is affected by vaccines.
[33:43.560 --> 33:52.600]  Well, the menstrual thing is something that seems to be quite transient and temporary,
[33:52.600 --> 33:54.320]  that's the point, that's one of the points.
[33:54.320 --> 33:55.560]  We need to study it more.
[33:55.560 --> 34:01.960]  Oh, we need to study it more, we need to study it more, it's just like human fertility,
[34:01.960 --> 34:07.600]  reproducing the species, the most important event in most people's lives, we need to study
[34:07.600 --> 34:08.600]  it more.
[34:08.600 --> 34:10.000]  Oh, but it's too late.
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.680]  We just forced millions of women to take that drug, sorry.
[34:16.680 --> 34:21.760]  So how did they release a vaccine and then make it mandatory when they didn't understand
[34:21.760 --> 34:25.840]  the long-term effects of the drug?
[34:25.840 --> 34:28.200]  That's a very good question.
[34:28.200 --> 34:32.600]  Here's Deborah Birx, she's the former White House COVID response director, again on Fox
[34:32.600 --> 34:33.600]  News.
[34:33.600 --> 34:38.440]  I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection and I think we overplayed
[34:38.440 --> 34:43.840]  the vaccines and it made people then worry that it's not going to protect against severe
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.320]  disease and hospitalization, it will, but let's be very clear, 50% of the people who
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.280]  died from the amicron surge were older, vaccinated.
[34:53.280 --> 34:54.280]  What?
[34:54.280 --> 35:03.000]  Stop the, quote, I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection, really
[35:03.000 --> 35:07.520]  Deborah Birx, but somehow you forgot to mention that as people were being fired from their
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.200]  jobs for not taking this on the premise that if they took it, they would never be infected.
[35:12.200 --> 35:14.040]  When do you get criminally charged?
[35:14.040 --> 35:15.040]  Soon we hope.
[35:15.040 --> 35:19.160]  And then there's the effect of the COVID vaccines on the elderly, the population most
[35:19.160 --> 35:20.160]  at risk.
[35:20.160 --> 35:27.400]  According to the Lancet, no less than vaccinated people around Joe Biden's age are 80% more
[35:27.400 --> 35:32.720]  likely to become sick after taking the COVID shot as compared to unvaccinated people.
[35:32.720 --> 35:33.720]  Wait, what?
[35:33.720 --> 35:37.880]  80% more likely to become sick after taking the shot that was supposed to prevent them
[35:37.880 --> 35:39.640]  from getting sick?
[35:39.640 --> 35:41.840]  How is this not the banner headline?
[35:41.840 --> 35:45.840]  It's being ignored.
[35:45.840 --> 35:48.960]  You don't even need to put two plus two together to understand.
[35:48.960 --> 35:51.640]  We told you it would attack the menstrual cycle.
[35:51.640 --> 35:56.760]  We told you it attacked the ovaries, the top scientist that headed up Pfizer who just retired
[35:56.760 --> 36:00.600]  a year before they launched this said that they'd done rat studies secretly.
[36:00.600 --> 36:02.600]  That's all come out.
[36:02.600 --> 36:10.280]  They did this on purpose and it has nanotech in it that starts reproducing in the body.
[36:10.280 --> 36:11.280]  You can't make that up.
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.160]  This, when I say an alien takeover, the globalists believe they're becoming a new species that
[36:16.160 --> 36:19.640]  are going to use us as the guinea pigs for it and that they're building a new species
[36:19.640 --> 36:21.400]  here on the planet.
[36:21.400 --> 36:24.640]  And you can pull up hundreds of headlines, scientists create new life forms on space
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.240]  station, scientists create new life forms in mine shaft, scientists create new chimeric
[36:30.240 --> 36:32.480]  creatures.
[36:32.480 --> 36:35.400]  That's what they're doing and then we try to have a discussion about it.
[36:35.400 --> 36:38.160]  They say shut up, nothing's happening or get used to it.
[36:38.160 --> 36:41.560]  It's a wonderful transition we're all in.
[36:41.560 --> 36:43.120]  Look at this.
[36:43.120 --> 36:48.240]  So many top scientists in Spain, in Germany, in New Zealand, in England, this is a shorter
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.040]  version of ours I've seen have looked at this electron microscope and it's on record and
[36:53.040 --> 37:02.160]  then you see the ingredients patented to grow a graphite oxide nano matrix in the body.
[37:02.160 --> 37:06.520]  These things replicate out of what's in your tissue.
[37:06.520 --> 37:10.880]  They grow in you, they colonize you.
[37:10.880 --> 37:13.840]  And it turns out Gates had all these patents to do it.
[37:13.840 --> 37:18.760]  They've just attacked us and people can't admit the horror they're under.
[37:18.760 --> 37:22.440]  Twice the national news going Alex Jones found guilty.
[37:22.440 --> 37:25.080]  Now a jury decides how much money he pays.
[37:25.080 --> 37:29.680]  They just slipped that in like, oh, the end of juries, the side of you're guilty.
[37:29.680 --> 37:30.680]  Same thing here.
[37:30.680 --> 37:32.800]  The end of the FDA doing testing.
[37:32.800 --> 37:38.240]  In fact, after this clip, queue up the Fauci clip again from the 1980s saying, oh, we couldn't
[37:38.240 --> 37:39.240]  approve this vaccine.
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.280]  We kill a bunch of people.
[37:42.280 --> 37:48.240]  But now he says we don't need any studies, but they've already done the secret studies.
[37:48.240 --> 37:53.280]  But first let's go to this little compilation of scientists, prestigious scientists documenting
[37:53.280 --> 37:56.640]  what's in these poison shots.
[37:56.640 --> 38:02.800]  We were contacted early in the week by a group of scientists who've been doing some scientific
[38:02.800 --> 38:09.280]  analysis and microscopy work on the Pfizer vaccine, which had been stimulated by some
[38:09.280 --> 38:16.200]  overseas reports by groups of very credible and credentialed experts, chemists and pathologists
[38:16.200 --> 38:23.440]  who were reporting finding what appears to be very, very tiny, but very complex sort of
[38:23.440 --> 38:27.040]  nanoscale technology.
[38:27.040 --> 38:31.320]  And the group in New Zealand have found exactly the same thing.
[38:31.320 --> 38:38.600]  So I was asked to go and have a look and I have certainly satisfied myself that these
[38:38.600 --> 38:43.320]  are not fakes and that these are real people and that this is real work having been done
[38:43.320 --> 38:44.320]  in New Zealand.
[38:44.320 --> 38:46.560]  Have you ever come across anything like this before?
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.920]  Well, we've been aware of the reports that I mentioned.
[38:49.920 --> 38:51.720]  From the overseas?
[38:51.720 --> 38:52.720]  Yes.
[38:52.720 --> 38:55.680]  And so there's a Spanish group.
[38:55.680 --> 39:02.600]  So Orwell.city is the website and they've been publishing work steadily.
[39:02.600 --> 39:09.840]  And there's a group in Germany, very eminent pathologists, who reported their findings
[39:09.840 --> 39:13.360]  on postmortems of people who died post-vaccination and they reported seeing things that they'd
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.000]  never seen before in their very long careers.
[39:16.000 --> 39:22.280]  They also reported finding unexpected ingredients, shall I say, in the vaccines.
[39:22.280 --> 39:26.480]  In fact, there were a number of other scientists and health professionals on that press conference
[39:26.480 --> 39:28.720]  who also reported the same thing.
[39:28.720 --> 39:32.960]  So it's still very shocking when you see it yourself.
[39:32.960 --> 39:37.280]  It's important to remember when you're looking at the pictures and the videos that this is
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.080]  nanoscale, which means extremely small.
[39:41.080 --> 39:47.880]  And some of the sort of behavior of what seems to be machinery or circuitry, rutus chips,
[39:47.880 --> 39:51.160]  that type of thing, it's very hard to explain.
[39:51.160 --> 39:55.920]  But scientists tell me that at that sort of scale, things like gravity and magnetism behave
[39:55.920 --> 39:56.920]  rather differently.
[39:56.920 --> 40:00.160]  And I certainly am no expert at all in this area.
[40:00.160 --> 40:05.720]  But having spent a very hurried few days really trying to improve up this work and satisfy
[40:05.720 --> 40:13.120]  ourselves that, you know, we need investigating by the professional regulators and investigators
[40:13.120 --> 40:15.840]  who are charged with protecting the public.
[40:15.840 --> 40:20.800]  You just heard on Tucker Carlson, the former head of these programs, saying, oh, we knew
[40:20.800 --> 40:23.040]  it wouldn't help you, but we still went ahead and did it.
[40:23.040 --> 40:25.080]  Oh, it'll help you all right.
[40:25.080 --> 40:27.240]  And these colonies are only one part of it.
[40:27.240 --> 40:33.880]  Also makes your body grow the poisonous cancer causing sterilizing spike protein.
[40:33.880 --> 40:38.400]  Here's Fauci explaining why you have to have testing of vaccines.
[40:38.400 --> 40:39.400]  Those were traditional vaccines.
[40:39.400 --> 40:41.200]  With these, it's a thousand times worse.
[40:41.200 --> 40:42.200]  Here he is.
[40:42.200 --> 40:47.040]  Any scientists are beginning to believe that a vaccine against AIDS may be impossible
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.680]  to make and too dangerous to test.
[40:50.680 --> 40:56.320]  If you take it and then a year goes by and everybody's fine, then you say, OK, that's
[40:56.320 --> 40:57.320]  good.
[40:57.320 --> 41:00.960]  Now let's give it to 500 people and then a year goes by and everything's fine.
[41:00.960 --> 41:03.760]  Say, well, now let's give it to thousands of people.
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.760]  And then you find out that it takes 12 years for all hell to break loose.
[41:08.760 --> 41:11.480]  And then what have you done?
[41:11.480 --> 41:12.480]  What have you done?
[41:12.480 --> 41:18.200]  Oh, but the head of the UN says, don't question the new rollout, the new lockdowns, the new
[41:18.200 --> 41:19.680]  fear.
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.600]  Here is a German member of the EU parliament, Christina Anderson, saying the vaccine campaign
[41:24.600 --> 41:28.240]  will go down as the biggest scandal in medical history.
[41:28.240 --> 41:36.160]  This vaccine campaign, it will go down as the biggest scandal in medical history.
[41:36.160 --> 41:44.640]  And moreover, it will be known as the biggest crime ever committed on humanity.
[41:44.640 --> 41:52.360]  Oh, yeah, mass sterilization, mass death, record numbers of young people dying.
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.400]  All the insurance company numbers are coming in, the actuaries.
[41:56.400 --> 41:58.240]  They really did it.
[41:58.240 --> 42:01.240]  And so it's not isolated, they're getting rid of all of our freedoms and cutting off
[42:01.240 --> 42:04.440]  our infrastructure and our food and getting rid of our borders and defunding the police
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.680]  and putting Soros criminals in every position of power.
[42:08.680 --> 42:14.080]  This is just the beginning until we really wake up that we're under attack.
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.320]  But see, half the population roughly took the poison shots and folks are so trained
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.600]  and never admit they're wrong under the mass hypnosis Stockholm paradigm that they will
[42:24.600 --> 42:28.600]  continue to defend it even as they mutate and even as they die.
[42:28.600 --> 42:33.160]  But the globalists believe some will mutate and become this new creature, this super
[42:33.160 --> 42:38.040]  sapien, but most of us will die in the process as we're just randomly injected with super
[42:38.040 --> 42:45.080]  high tech, super science, replication systems that take over every damn cell in our body.
[42:45.080 --> 42:46.400]  It's here, folks.
[42:46.400 --> 42:47.400]  It's going down.
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.320]  Most people just get sick and have blood clots and slowly die, but others, a lot of weird
[42:51.320 --> 42:52.320]  stuff's happening to them.
[42:52.320 --> 42:57.240]  And of course, it sterilizes you as well, we'll be right back.
[42:57.240 --> 43:05.280]  The globalist great reset or the war for the world is here, but humanity is not being caught
[43:05.280 --> 43:09.760]  flat footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[43:09.760 --> 43:14.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical heart of
[43:14.440 --> 43:19.720]  the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[43:19.720 --> 43:22.360]  like you've never done before.
[43:22.360 --> 43:24.720]  We have come so far together.
[43:24.720 --> 43:28.480]  Please help keep us on the air, we're under massive attack right now, but we're going
[43:28.480 --> 43:29.760]  to win with your help.
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.080]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[43:33.080 --> 43:36.480]  Please go to infoworkstore.com and get this book.
[43:36.480 --> 43:38.800]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.

[43:50.440 --> 43:55.040]  as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because
[43:55.040 --> 43:57.400]  it warns the world of the globalist plan.

[44:00.480 --> 44:05.840]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first and the three coin founding member
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.240]  series, George Washington slaying the dragon.
[44:09.240 --> 44:13.240]  Then we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally the second amendment come and take
[44:13.240 --> 44:14.240]  it.
[44:14.240 --> 44:24.680]  There are only 75 points left in the three point series exclusively right now at 1776

[45:00.040 --> 45:06.480]  There is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[45:06.480 --> 45:11.320]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not going to
[45:11.320 --> 45:13.800]  find a better place for information.
[45:13.800 --> 45:17.160]  You might not agree with everything you might not agree with all our perspectives but we
[45:17.160 --> 45:21.800]  cover all the information and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here thank

[45:37.600 --> 45:38.600]  as well.
[45:38.600 --> 45:43.080]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks this is a joke I mean we're giving
[45:43.080 --> 45:48.240]  this thing away at 75% off by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair
[45:48.240 --> 45:56.680]  and beard formula is working for me quite well I might add quite well my barber appreciates
[45:56.680 --> 46:02.480]  hair and beard support for men I go and see them quite often now sold out for seven months
[46:02.480 --> 46:06.840]  bodies ultimate turmeric formula is back to talk.

[49:08.800 --> 49:15.440]  have fb i people everybody involved it's it's just unspeakable but i wanted to just illustrate
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.320]  something here before i hit some of this news dealing with this and that's just a few minutes
[49:21.320 --> 49:25.600]  of it it's a long report i'm not gonna play at all but look at how the cnbc shepherd smith
[49:25.600 --> 49:31.840]  report starts he's already been found guilty and they don't tell you how by a judge and
[49:31.840 --> 49:36.920]  now a jury's gonna decide how much the guilty man that did intentionally hurt these people
[49:36.920 --> 49:46.680]  but i never said their names again al capone got a trial charlie manson got a trial jeffrey
[49:46.680 --> 49:56.120]  donmer got a trial and remember this my fake show trial is all over everywhere on every
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.440]  jam channel because they hate populist they think they can demonize alec shones they can
[50:01.440 --> 50:07.880]  beat you but the gisling maxwell government child molesting jeffrey eppstein operation
[50:07.880 --> 50:11.560]  it wasn't televised it was highly censored because they were protecting themselves and
[50:11.560 --> 50:16.680]  how they use sex trafficking of children to protect themselves and everywhere you swing
[50:16.680 --> 50:22.520]  a stick you run into one of these people connected to children and taking children away and this
[50:22.520 --> 50:29.000]  whole new world order operation it's the very essence of what they're after is our innocence
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.160]  and our children with their transgenderism and their poison shots and all of it it is
[50:33.160 --> 50:37.400]  a crime against humanity we've got to just take the blinders off and admit what we're
[50:37.400 --> 50:48.040]  up against so the jeffrey eppstein gisling maxwell trial wasn't on tv but the cps operative
[50:49.400 --> 50:55.160]  who wrote the texas handbook on taking children away and how parents don't have rights she's
[50:55.160 --> 51:01.800]  my special soros judge isn't that interesting and a lot of people are digging into her right
[51:01.800 --> 51:05.800]  now and they're finding some really nightmarish stuff well let me tell you she was looking
[51:05.800 --> 51:13.880]  at me yesterday with just enjoyment and hate i like i i i janet renault looked as evil in person
[51:13.880 --> 51:17.720]  and i've been around hillary clinton in person and seen him from like 20 30 feet away when they gave
[51:17.720 --> 51:24.280]  speeches and they they don't look like they look like demons and i'm just being honest and
[51:25.240 --> 51:29.240]  that's what i saw in that courtroom was almost a whole group against me i looked over there and
[51:29.240 --> 51:34.200]  they look like biden like robots and they would just give me these weird demonic smiles these
[51:34.200 --> 51:41.080]  people are turned over to evil folks this is truly the rise of hell unbelievable absolute

[51:53.080 --> 51:58.920]  by claiming that that massacre was a hoax with crisis actors today testimony in the civil
[51:58.920 --> 52:05.960]  trial began to decide how much he owes them for his words and actions neil helson and scarlet
[52:05.960 --> 52:11.640]  lewis six-year-old son died in the school massacre okay that's why you're told that you're in
[52:11.640 --> 52:17.960]  that's enough well what a fast one oh he was found guilty implying i'm a criminal

[52:57.720 --> 53:03.240]  how guilty i am because i've already been said that i'm guilty mike ceramics read the yahoo news
[53:03.240 --> 53:07.720]  article that basically admitted all this but said it was good and said this is the most rigged case
[53:07.720 --> 53:12.840]  i've ever read about in all of u.s history because it really is because that's where we are and he's
[53:12.840 --> 53:18.520]  a lawyer judge admonishes alex jones for speaking outside courtroom on the first day of sandy hook
[53:18.520 --> 53:22.360]  i've mentioned trial she told the media to set up up there they're out there screaming at me when
[53:22.360 --> 53:29.800]  i walk in you're getting it you're guilty we're gonna ruin you but i walk out and talk to the
[53:29.800 --> 53:35.880]  president she goes you don't talk when you're on this floor that's a quote you can talk to people

[53:43.400 --> 53:48.040]  a million dollar industry they are out there every week making money somebody needs to write a story

[53:53.720 --> 53:58.600]  son was tragically killed never said their names never did but they said if there's a for 10 years
[53:58.600 --> 54:08.520]  i persecuted them and destroyed their lives unbelievable and we're not supposed to i i
[54:08.520 --> 54:16.120]  guess talk about the judges said that that man and woman just won a 72 the insurance companies
[54:16.120 --> 54:23.240]  caved in 73 excuse me million dollar lawsuit that bankrupted remington it's the same group
[54:25.720 --> 54:32.840]  the same organization 73 million that's not enough they want 150 million from me good luck
[54:34.360 --> 54:42.440]  unbelievable ladies and gentlemen and they love the attention the the judge and the media and the
[54:42.440 --> 54:48.120]  lawyers and all of it and the sandy hook families that have sued are all over the news constantly
[54:48.120 --> 54:52.280]  saying that i got famous off sandy hook when i barely ever even talked about it was a big
[54:52.280 --> 54:56.440]  controversy people didn't believe it because the government's so unbelievable and then they say
[54:56.440 --> 55:01.400]  that i had a secret plan to get rich off of it when i tried to settle with them with every dime of
[55:01.400 --> 55:07.320]  cash we had months ago and said look i don't want to have a show trial i know what you're doing
[55:07.320 --> 55:14.680]  to the i said if you really you know just just want everything i got here it is but now there's
[55:14.680 --> 55:18.440]  nothing to settle with in the future because there is nothing and we'll just stay on here one way or
[55:18.440 --> 55:24.040]  the other thanks to our listeners and supporters that's who i wanted to think is all of you that
[55:24.040 --> 55:27.800]  have stood with us we're going to have to raise more money and they're going to do their show
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.160]  trials and have their i mean i would imagine hell the next word it might be a billion dollars make
[55:33.160 --> 55:38.120]  it ten billion i'm already been told i'm guilty the judge tells him he's guilty he's guilty right
[55:38.120 --> 55:42.600]  in front of me this man is guilty do you understand that no judge ever did that how about prejudicing
[55:42.600 --> 55:48.520]  a jury she's got people on the hall screaming at me oh they're good you know they're hanging out with
[55:48.520 --> 55:55.000]  the plaintiffs and so as long as we have the funds folks we are going to appeal and we're going to
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.520]  battle for years in the courts while the whole new world order takes over and our credibility
[56:00.520 --> 56:05.400]  shoots the top and we either defeat the new world order or we all go down with the ship that's where
[56:05.400 --> 56:12.280]  we're at and so the funds is what we need that's why they want a hundred to fifty million dollar
[56:12.280 --> 56:16.840]  judgment because then you've got to get depending on how it works ten twenty thirty percent of the
[56:16.840 --> 56:22.600]  bail we won't be able to get that and they want to then send a receiver in to turn the lights out
[56:22.600 --> 56:27.240]  they admit that they said our goal is to silence him and shut him down but we got other folks out
[56:27.240 --> 56:31.560]  there as long as it's not my studio or my money we'll be able to operate somewhere else but it'll
[56:31.560 --> 56:36.760]  be very disruptive I want to fight through this we'll be able to do the appeals we'll be able to

[59:32.520 --> 59:39.560]  survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready go to preparetoday.com for the essentials
[59:40.120 --> 59:47.720]  storable foods water filtration first aid power and more at preparetoday.com
[59:50.440 --> 59:56.440]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[59:56.440 --> 1:00:06.920]  for being deleted by youtube and social media in 2018 most people did nothing to defend alex
[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:13.960]  jones or info wars instead they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their
[1:00:13.960 --> 1:00:20.360]  submission as a necessary evil as a result things have only gotten worse for everyone
[1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:27.160]  and without any recourse they are about to get much worse alex jones is now patient zero for
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.880]  america's new de facto justice system brought to you by the fear complacency and inaction of the
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:41.000]  people take it here's how we can all expect to now be treated even though never mentioned their name
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:47.640]  and the parents never sought a retraction alones is being sued for defamation and intentional
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:53.720]  infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at sandy hook elementary
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:01:00.680]  school the rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents and the legal team is comprised of highly
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:07.640]  politicized members of the anti-gun lobby who have admitted their intention is to silence alex jones
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:14.280]  so with this new precedent if you dare question the official narrative say for example the school
[1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:21.320]  shooting in uvaldi texas then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress but it only
[1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:28.200]  gets worse the plaintiffs claim that alex jones was the perpetrator of the sandy hook crisis actor
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.760]  conspiracy theory which is demonstrably false after all the censorship and deleted videos one
[1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:42.040]  can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources all questioning
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:48.840]  the official narrative of sandy hook it was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:56.760]  since 9 11 and over the course of seven years alex jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it
[1:01:56.760 --> 1:02:02.840]  we know this because it's all part of the public record but these radical judges do not care about
[1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:08.840]  evidence i am not currently representing alex jones so i am free to speak my mind um they're
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:15.080]  already apparently i've heard that the plaintiffs lawyers are complaining uh about me speaking out
[1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:20.760]  about the case that's how corrupt these plaintiffs lawyers are their political hacks standing on the
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:26.600]  bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights and i find it
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:32.280]  disgusting what they've done and so but in this particular context uh jones has produced more
[1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:36.200]  discovery than anybody i can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is and yet they
[1:02:36.200 --> 1:02:43.240]  pretended that he didn't why because they built their whole case on a big lie both judge gamble in
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:50.440]  texas and judge bellis in connecticut have found alex jones guilty without ever holding a trial
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:56.840]  or hearing any evidence which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in america including
[1:02:56.840 --> 1:03:03.640]  charles manson and al capone and their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that
[1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:10.680]  jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist whatever that
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:18.120]  mysterious unspecified evidence is both judges have stripped jones of his first amendment right
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:26.200]  but judge gamble has gone much further judge maya gamble comes from cps who has been exposed for
[1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:33.080]  human trafficking and working with pedophiles gamble helped publish cps propaganda praising the
[1:03:33.080 --> 1:03:39.800]  state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused
[1:03:39.800 --> 1:03:47.000]  in foster care in the alex jones case judge gamble has ordered that the words first amendment
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:54.760]  and free speech cannot be used by alex jones his witnesses or even his lawyers he is not allowed to
[1:03:54.760 --> 1:04:00.680]  defend himself judge gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:06.760]  trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children they are only allowed to hear how
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:14.040]  their trauma was caused by the words of alex jones and during jury selection not a single juror
[1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:21.720]  thought the media has ever treated alex jones or info wars unfairly and any juror who questioned the
[1:04:21.720 --> 1:04:27.320]  100 million dollar amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury
[1:04:27.320 --> 1:04:34.040]  alex jones was cancelled from social media in 2018 and is now being cancelled from the
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:41.320]  us bill of rights and constitution and because of our complacency everyone else is next and in
[1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:47.160]  case you were wondering the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven
[1:04:47.160 --> 1:04:55.080]  guilty it relied upon the burden of proof and it was pretty good reporting for info wars this is

[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:06.680]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is robert barnes hosting today we'll be discussing a
[1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:11.960]  little bit later will donald trump be indicted we'll also be discussing whether or not the judge
[1:06:11.960 --> 1:06:17.480]  in the alex jones case lied to the jury about the law in the rather peculiar professional
[1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:23.240]  history of the judge before she became a judge but up first we're going to be discussing geopolitics
[1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:29.080]  around the globe will the deep state lose its globalist battle in ukraine what is happening
[1:06:29.080 --> 1:06:34.600]  with the great great reset from the netherlands to srelanka what is going to be the geopolitical
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:40.760]  future of the globe in light of the ukrainian conflict and the biden administration's policies
[1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:47.000]  the best independent geopolitical analyst i know anywhere in the globe is the dirand
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:52.840]  you can find them at the dirand dot locals dot com you can also find their youtube rumble odyssey
[1:06:52.840 --> 1:06:58.840]  and other channels they are also have separate independent channels and that's alex christopheru
[1:06:58.840 --> 1:07:05.240]  or as i like to say christ for you uh and alexander macaurus uh whose family has a george
[1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:10.200]  washington type legacy in greek politics bringing independence and freedom to that country they're
[1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:15.960]  both named alex so unsurprisingly they have great names in the name of alex jones but also they're
[1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:21.640]  greeks but so let's start to discuss global geopolitics with two of the best analysts i know
[1:07:22.360 --> 1:07:31.720]  alex and alexander welcome to the show delighted to be here great to be here robert can you uh alex
[1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:39.320]  start off with what was supposed to be the objective in ukraine and how much has the
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:45.480]  globalist agenda the western agenda the biden administration e u agenda how much have they
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:53.560]  able been able to achieve that agenda well the uh the agenda i believe was regime change
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:58.760]  in moscow i mean they wanted putin out you actually had biden on a trip to poland
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:06.120]  about three months ago he actually let it slip that the goal of uh of ukraine was regime change
[1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:11.080]  in moscow in other words ukraine was just going to be kind of this this proxy war that would
[1:08:11.080 --> 1:08:17.640]  eventually lead to regime change in the russian federation their hopes was that this conflict
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:25.560]  in ukraine coupled with an economic shock and awe type of uh of war would would lead for the
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:31.480]  putin government to collapse and then you know within a matter of two three four weeks they
[1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:37.960]  would have their uh their new guy as the president of russia um it did not work obviously we've seen
[1:08:37.960 --> 1:08:44.120]  the russian economy bounce back very very strong we see the russians are winning the uh the war
[1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:49.320]  in ukraine they're doing it with a force that is still geared towards a special military
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:54.200]  operations of operation the russians have not declared war they have not thrown all of their
[1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:59.480]  military behind this uh this war as a matter of fact robert the russians are even going to hold
[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:05.880]  drills in the east of the country to show that they still have much of their military not participating
[1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:12.680]  in this conflict so this has been an absolute policy disaster for the biden white house in
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:18.600]  alexander what did they get wrong and why did they get it wrong what what did the biden administration
[1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.800]  the state department the e u crowd the boris johnson administration as long as it lasts
[1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:27.880]  what did they get wrong in assessing what they thought they could achieve versus what the
[1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:34.760]  outcome has been in ukraine i think what they got wrong was briefly russia i think they completely
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:41.720]  underestimated the country i think they had a very mistaken idea of the sides of its economy
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:49.880]  the diversity of its economy the sophistication of its economic decision making they thought they
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:56.120]  they really believed that it was a gas station masquerading as a country and i think they also
[1:09:56.120 --> 1:10:04.040]  greatly underestimated the extreme ability of russia's diplomacy and of its military side
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:09.560]  so we see now you know the russian foreign minister sir gay labrov traveling to the
[1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:15.960]  middle east to africa on what is starting to look like almost a triumphant tour he's got friends
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:22.920]  everywhere part of the reason he's got friends is because putin and the russian leadership have
[1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:31.720]  actually said quite clearly quite explicitly this is a war about globalization we are resisting
[1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:42.360]  the drive of certain people in the west to impose globalization upon us and that message is receiving
[1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:49.960]  support across the world so they underestimated russia's inherent potential and they underestimated
[1:10:49.960 --> 1:10:56.840]  the amount of political and diplomatic support and economic support russia is getting around the world
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:02.760]  alexander what do you think comes next in other words in the near short term future both of you
[1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:08.040]  have been spectacular at predicting this conflict from the very inception as to what was likely
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:13.640]  to happen in the near short term and mid term what do you see is the future of this conflict what
[1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:18.760]  happens to ukraine what happens to russia what happens to the agenda of the globalist as it
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:26.120]  relates to ukraine well i think if we're talking about ukraine and russia russia is going to win
[1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:32.120]  the war and it's going to win the war within the next couple of weeks months at most i don't know
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:39.560]  how i can't give you a definite timeline but i think august the the month that's coming is going
[1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:45.880]  to be the decisive month we're starting to see battles happening in eastern ukraine in southern
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:51.640]  ukraine it's clear that the russian military is winning the war and he's going to win it big now
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:58.200]  at the same time what's he going to mean for the sort of geopolitical the global way in which the
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:04.840]  international architecture works well the first thing you've got to see is that people around
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:15.240]  the world now see that the eu the globalist power centers are not as powerful as they first seemed
[1:12:15.800 --> 1:12:19.880]  and that's going to give people a lot of encouragement it's going to mean
[1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:27.320]  a major reordering of the world towards as and putin has said this power going back
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:35.720]  to sovereign states a repudiation of the globalist project and you're going to see that this project
[1:12:35.720 --> 1:12:42.840]  is now going to over the next couple of weeks and months may face a major setback now people
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:48.120]  have been talking about the economic problems in the united states and they're real they're
[1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:55.960]  indisputably real the economic problems in the european union are far greater because the europeans
[1:12:56.600 --> 1:13:02.680]  are completely aligned with this globalist project they believe the propaganda that you
[1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:08.200]  know that russia was this house of cards that it would collapse quickly and what we now have
[1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:16.520]  is the prospect of energy rationing in europe a major industrial crisis in europe we have an
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:25.560]  inflation crisis which makes that in the u.s. seem almost minor by comparison so things are looking
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:30.600]  like you know in europe we're going to see a major shift and we've just learned today
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:38.600]  that go hard schroder who is the politician he was the former german chancellor he was he's known to
[1:13:38.600 --> 1:13:45.480]  be the representative of german industry of the big industrial groups his very strong connections
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:53.960]  with fawkes vagan he's now in moscow on some kind of private perhaps semi-secret mission
[1:13:53.960 --> 1:13:59.400]  and all the world the word is that he's out there he's now trying to make connections
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:05.880]  with the russian leadership to try to find some way out for europe from this and that will mean
[1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:13.080]  the shaffing of the e u consensus the shaffing of the globalist power structures and a return
[1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:19.960]  to a world a world system based on sovereign states and alex can you sum up for people that may not
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:26.040]  have followed european politics in detail just a number of countries that have suffered political
[1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:32.440]  turmoil from blowback from the ukrainian conflict in terms of britain france italy bulgaria etc
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:40.440]  yeah well france macron didn't have such a good go in the recent elections and he did lose his
[1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:46.840]  his power in the uh in the parliament um we had estonia actually the government collapsed
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:51.080]  though it has now come back again the same government but it did collapse we had the
[1:14:51.080 --> 1:14:54.440]  government in bulgaria collapsed and i'm not sure where they are right now but i
[1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:59.960]  i think they're having a hard time trying to form a new coalition and uh and the previous
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:05.560]  government that did collapse was very much aligned with the w e f with uh the globalist
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:11.640]  uh center you also have of course draghi mario draghi the former goldman sacks
[1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:20.280]  e c b head who was the unelected prime minister of italy he has bolted and he has decided to
[1:15:20.280 --> 1:15:25.800]  call it quits he's very happy to leave because he sees what's coming and we are going to have
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:32.760]  elections in italy and um robert i think this is very much kind of the the curse of zelenski
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:37.240]  it seems like whoever is supporting zelenski their government is collapsing of course i'm boris
[1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:42.840]  johnson boris johnson is out though he may be the new nato a secretary general if you believe the
[1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:48.440]  telegraph exactly when we come back we will discuss will biden start world war three with china

[1:20:03.640 --> 1:20:16.760]  jones welcome back to the alex jones show robert barnes hosting later on we'll be discussing will
[1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:23.560]  biden indict donald trump as his hail mary to save his own skin in the midterms did the judge
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:29.720]  in the alex jones case lie to the jury about the law of libel and the right of apology is a mitigating
[1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:34.840]  aspect for damages that will be discussing a little bit later in the show also later in the
[1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:40.600]  bottom half of the hour we'll be discussing with the doran that you can find at the doran dot locals
[1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:48.200]  dot com also on youtube and rumble and other platforms the issue of whether or not we will
[1:20:48.200 --> 1:20:53.960]  end up going to war with china and is that a realistic risk moving forward but first up
[1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:59.400]  what about the future of europe is europe collapsing what might be is europe just going to become a
[1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:05.240]  future disneyland a place you go and visit for the history in the tourism that is the question
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:11.240]  at this segment alexander you mentioned the collapsing aspect of europe's economy of critical
[1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:16.840]  aspects of that economy the historic deal that putin did with germany to establish cheap natural
[1:21:16.840 --> 1:21:21.640]  gas in exchange for them getting rid of nuclear energy to satisfy their greens in exchange gave
[1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:27.320]  them an economic edge in industrial production and kept germany's industrial economic engine alive
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:31.000]  now they're scrapping all that and they're talking about maybe you shouldn't shower for a couple of
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:37.640]  months and maybe you should go to a heating center somewhere what is the future of germany what is
[1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:44.840]  the future of europe economically given its current pace in a word in a word robert is bleak
[1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:51.720]  it's very very difficult to be at all optimistic about europe in fact the more pessimistic you
[1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:58.760]  are the more realistic you are you summed it up perfectly the whole economic system in germany
[1:21:58.760 --> 1:22:06.680]  was based upon importing cheap energy from russia that was why they did that they didn't do it out
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:14.280]  of charity for the russians german industry needs cheap power in order to make remain competitive
[1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:21.720]  it doesn't have the giant economies of scale that you find for example in china in the united
[1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:28.680]  state so this was this energy partnership that they created and it was the primary driver of the
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:35.240]  german economy and because the german economy is the dominant economy in europe it was what kept the
[1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:42.600]  whole locomotive of the european union together and enabled the european union the people who
[1:22:42.600 --> 1:22:49.080]  lead it to carry through with their ideas of eu unity integration basically doing away with
[1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:56.040]  sovereign states within europe all that kind of thing now the germans going along with this idea
[1:22:56.040 --> 1:23:03.640]  that they could smash russia via this crisis in ukraine have cut themselves off from russian gas
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:08.280]  and it's important to understand they're never going to get it back the russians will never
[1:23:08.280 --> 1:23:16.440]  provide them with gas in the same scale in the same way that they did previously so the germans
[1:23:16.440 --> 1:23:24.360]  have now locked themselves in to a situation of long-term uncompetitiveness they're going to pay
[1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:29.400]  an awful lot more from that for their energy than other countries more for their energy than the
[1:23:29.400 --> 1:23:37.480]  united states which produces most of its energy more for its energy than say china will because
[1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:44.840]  china will be getting energy from russia so the germans have it set themselves up for the
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:53.640]  deindustrialization of their country for a prolonged industrial crisis in germany and it's
[1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:59.640]  impossible to see how that can how that can be turned around and of course on top of that
[1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:07.000]  you have in europe a political structure that's been built up over the last 70 years
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:18.120]  which is incredibly stifling it's not got much democratic legitimacy or vitality because power
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:24.440]  has been drained away from the states to the EU center which remains and it's important to say
[1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:32.120]  and say this unelected that means that the center cannot itself make decisions which people around
[1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:38.680]  europe are really going to sign up to and accept it when you know when the EU center talks about
[1:24:38.680 --> 1:24:44.600]  sacrifices why should people accept those sacrifices when they're demanded of them by
[1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:52.760]  people who are unelected but at the same time the EU center itself and by extension if you like
[1:24:52.760 --> 1:24:59.560]  the people who run things in germany don't like strong sovereign states across europe
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:06.520]  able to make their own decisions and that means that we have no political class no political
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:14.440]  leadership anywhere in europe that can actually plan and find a way out of this problem so we
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:20.760]  are in a very very bad place far worse than the one you will find in the united states where you
[1:25:20.760 --> 1:25:28.680]  still have a high degree a real degree of vitality in your political system and where your economy is
[1:25:28.680 --> 1:25:35.240]  much better much more self-sufficient and far more resilient in face of these kinds of problems
[1:25:36.120 --> 1:25:42.200]  and alex uh it doesn't look like there's much hope in the uk elections to replace bojo boris
[1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:48.040]  johnson and that both candidates that appear to be there seem to be featuring the same defects of
[1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:53.160]  policy decision making that boris johnson himself represented it looks almost like a pre trump
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:59.560]  american electoral scene of twiddle dumb or twiddle dumber uh what's your take on the uk prospects
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:06.680]  of the two exist does it matter which candidate wins the uk primary contest not really but uh
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:11.080]  in greece we have a saying robert we say in uh politics especially when you get to the level
[1:26:11.080 --> 1:26:17.000]  of prime minister or president we always say the next guy is going to be worse than the previous
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:22.360]  guy and i think you're seeing that in uh in the uk play out i don't think it matters too much
[1:26:22.360 --> 1:26:29.400]  whether it's sunak or trust but uh all all indicators point to trust at the moment but
[1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:36.840]  either way i think uh you're going to get a much a much worse version of boris johnson
[1:26:36.840 --> 1:26:43.240]  at 10 downing street and if it's any indication what to expect from um the next prime minister of
[1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:48.920]  the uk all you have to do is look at that the viral video that is making the rounds on the interwebs
[1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:55.160]  where during the debate it appears that the host of the debate fainted or had some sort of medical
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:27:01.240]  issue and uh you could just see the reaction from trust the panic and the fear and she almost ran away
[1:27:01.880 --> 1:27:07.400]  when uh when when the host appears to have crashed the florid if that's going to be the level of
[1:27:07.400 --> 1:27:15.480]  leadership that awaits the uk well things are not going to be looking very good no doubt about it
[1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:20.040]  when we come back on the bottom half of the hour we'll discuss whether or not the bite
[1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:25.560]  administration will end up waging war in china we want to remind all of you that you are the front

[1:33:11.240 --> 1:33:17.320]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is robert barnes hosting we are on with the doran
[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:23.800]  well you can find at the doran dot locals dot com as well as in a range of other platforms from
[1:33:23.800 --> 1:33:29.480]  youtube to rumble from bit shoot to odyssey let's talk about one of the topics that's on a lot of
[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:35.160]  people's minds because after it looked like we were risking world war three with russia now it
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:40.200]  looks like aspects of our deep state and the biden administration want to see if maybe we could have
[1:33:40.200 --> 1:33:45.640]  world war three with china instead indeed the logic where we suddenly saw a bunch of articles
[1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:52.040]  exposing a range of issues about china's influence in america all out of the blue back to back by
[1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:57.640]  institutional media suddenly we're now concerned with china buying up us real estate near military
[1:33:57.640 --> 1:34:03.400]  bases suddenly we're now concerned with their telecom giants having buying property near places
[1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:08.200]  that could interfere with our nuclear arsenal suddenly now general milley is running around
[1:34:08.200 --> 1:34:13.960]  mr woekster running around southeast asia saying china is the great threat even the u k premier
[1:34:13.960 --> 1:34:18.600]  candidates were on script when they saw that then they started talking about china being the great
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:24.200]  threat now we're sending nancy polosi herself who just in a drunken stupor might lead to world war
[1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:30.760]  three going to taiwan so the question is how much risk are we that once again the globalist in the
[1:34:30.760 --> 1:34:35.640]  white house and the incompetence in the biden administration may stumble and bumble us into
[1:34:35.640 --> 1:34:42.920]  world war three alexander how big is the risk that we go to war with china i'm afraid it's a real
[1:34:42.920 --> 1:34:48.440]  risk and can i just say stumble and bumble is about the right word because what i think has happened
[1:34:48.440 --> 1:34:54.440]  is that we've gone from a position which was donald trump's position which is that we start to push
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:35:02.520]  back on china in economics we impose tariffs we route out chinese companies we route out chinese
[1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:09.400]  influence we build up the industrial base of the united states we deal with uh you know we look at
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:15.080]  we concern ourselves with the welfare of the united states we've gone from that perspective
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:21.320]  towards china which is a fully legitimate one and one which the chinese themselves understood
[1:35:21.320 --> 1:35:27.960]  they may not have liked it but they understood it to a geopolitical confrontation with china
[1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:36.680]  an attempt if you like to roll back chinese influence not because this concerns the united
[1:35:36.680 --> 1:35:40.840]  states the welfare of the united states in the same way that trump was worried about
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:48.680]  but because china in some ways is seen as standing in the way of the globalist project the wef project
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:54.200]  because the chinese have managed to turn it to their own advantage and they've been increasing
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:36:01.720]  their power in a way that some people don't like so we've had these strange moves over taiwan which i
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:08.760]  don't think frankly was a real problem a short time ago i don't think the chinese were planning
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:14.520]  an invasion of taiwan but the way this whole thing has been arranged with prolozie going with all
[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:22.360]  this rhetoric about opening up what is in effect of taiwanese embassy in washington that's suddenly
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:29.880]  become an issue and what made this whole thing utterly toxic is at the same time that we've been
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:36.040]  that the united states has been making these moves over taiwan which are hostile to china
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:45.080]  we have biden coming along and telling xixin ping well actually we continue with our one china policy
[1:36:45.080 --> 1:36:50.440]  we still accept that taiwan is part of china we still recognize your government as the
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:57.000]  government of china and the chinese whatever they are they're not stupid and they can see that this
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:04.040]  is a game which is a double game that has been played and xixin ping actually told biden you
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:10.440]  can actually see it in the chinese read app you tell me one thing and your administration does
[1:37:10.440 --> 1:37:18.840]  another in other words i don't trust you and where trust goes between two powerful countries like
[1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:26.200]  china and the united states it becomes impossible because at that point you can't rely on any
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:32.520]  discussions you can't assume that if biden says look i'm not going to send troops to taiwan
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:39.720]  or polosi is only going there in a private capacity the chinese don't believe that anymore
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:45.880]  so we see the chinese now making their counter moves the us or rather the administration talking
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:53.960]  about pushing back to china it's very easy to see how we could miscalculate and find ourselves
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:38:01.640]  in a shooting war which nobody actually i think really wants no doubt about it alex you've mentioned
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:08.280]  the uh in both of you have mentioned the ties between the clinton administration and the institutionalization
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:15.240]  of certain policies and personnel that date to that can you explain for people why that explains
[1:38:15.240 --> 1:38:20.120]  some of the recklessness that we have seen from the biden administration what many of you as you
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:26.680]  have both said one of the maybe the most incompetent administration in american recent modern political
[1:38:26.680 --> 1:38:32.120]  history yeah a lot of this foreign policy robert uh comes from obviously the department of state
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  the department of state is hillary clinton's domain you look at people like blinkin and newland
[1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:45.320]  and even selivan who's not in the department of state but he he plays a central role with national
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:49.960]  security and he's very much connected and he works with blinkin they're the ones that are
[1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:54.520]  formulating it appears they're the ones that are formulating all of these policies whether it's
[1:38:54.520 --> 1:39:03.160]  ukraine or it's now uh taiwan and china and we just have to go back maybe six months ago two
[1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:10.120]  a year ago when the russians were telling the united states they were saying look all ukraine
[1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:16.200]  has to do is just say that they're going to stay neutral just just tell them to say that they're
[1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:22.520]  going to stay neutral and then everything is going to be okay they could not get zelensky to
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:27.640]  admit that and now here we are with taiwan we're we're we're china is saying look don't send
[1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:35.800]  nancy polosi to taiwan you need to uh to recognize the one china policy and now we're seeing that
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:42.440]  the united states is stuck in a in a box they box themselves in if they don't send nancy polosi
[1:39:42.440 --> 1:39:46.840]  to taiwan the biden white house is going to look weak and it's going to look like she's lost if
[1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:52.840]  they send her to taiwan god knows where things are going to go mitch mcconnell said the other day he
[1:39:52.840 --> 1:40:00.040]  said nancy polosi will have to go to taiwan because if she doesn't then it's like and i quote
[1:40:00.040 --> 1:40:07.160]  handing china sort of a victory of sorts these guys in the department of state they have completely
[1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:14.600]  boxed the united states in and either option whatever nancy polosi does is not going to be
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:21.880]  a good option for the united states for china and for the world uh alexander what should we be uh on
[1:40:21.880 --> 1:40:27.800]  the alert for for risk escalating is it watching to see what happens when polosi goes you mentioned
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:32.520]  that in the past this clinton influence does state department may think china's just bluffing
[1:40:32.520 --> 1:40:38.120]  and how that may be wrong how will we what what should we uh be on the alert for for escalating
[1:40:38.120 --> 1:40:44.040]  the risk in the near short term well i think the big thing to understand about china is that it's
[1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:50.440]  not a country you should bluff it's it's a country that will always call your bluff because that's
[1:40:50.440 --> 1:40:58.920]  nature of chinese society they they will not let themselves be humiliated by by the united states
[1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:05.160]  as they see it they will certainly not be humiliated over taiwan which for them is a national security
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:10.920]  issue and it's also an issue which we must always remember it goes directly to the heart of the
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:20.280]  legitimacy of the chinese government now if nancy polosi goes to taiwan as she says that she will
[1:41:20.280 --> 1:41:26.280]  and starts talking to taiwan as if taiwan is an independent country and gives the impression
[1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:32.360]  that the administration and the chinese don't buy this idea that she's going to taiwan without the
[1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:38.840]  green light from the administration if nancy polosi goes to taiwan and starts saying we the united
[1:41:38.840 --> 1:41:47.640]  states will stand by taiwan against chinese threats will defend chai taiwan against chinese
[1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:55.880]  threats well at that point the chinese will feel under enormous pressure from within to respond
[1:41:55.880 --> 1:42:01.400]  to that and that could result in a military response now the chinese officials have all
[1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:06.680]  been saying this they've been giving private warnings to the administration i understand
[1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:12.760]  that a chinese official a top chinese official actually recently said that their military
[1:42:12.760 --> 1:42:17.960]  is ready to take action and was it their military is ready to take action and we don't know what kind
[1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:24.760]  of action they might take a no-fly zone a sea blockade something more something less we don't
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:33.160]  know what does the united states do does it act to break this blockade the you know no-fly zone
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:40.920]  or does it sit back abandon taiwan and end up being humiliated so that's how we could end up
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:46.680]  in a real conflict situation extraordinary when we come back we'll be talking about the great reset

[1:49:15.400 --> 1:49:21.560]  them at the diran dot locals dot com the best geopolitical analysts that i have found anywhere
[1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:25.880]  that have been above and ahead of the curve consistently and constantly for years but
[1:49:25.880 --> 1:49:31.720]  especially over the crazy last six months we've experienced in global geopolitics so let's talk
[1:49:31.720 --> 1:49:38.280]  about the global reset uh and then we'll later talk about the best of the clown worlds of which
[1:49:38.280 --> 1:49:43.400]  there have been so many that alex has been able to put up a daily clown world now for months
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:48.360]  because there's as crazy as it gets it gets a little bit more crazy after that thanks in part
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:54.040]  to vander crazy and others in our global political leadership structure uh but alexander we've seen
[1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:58.680]  some blowback from the great reset we were seeing it in the dutch protest we're seeing it now in some
[1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:03.800]  german protest we're seeing it now uh we saw it in srelanka the government overthrown we're seeing
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:09.480]  talk of it in panama talk of it in canada can you describe what the landscape is of how aspects of
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:15.320]  the great reset agenda particularly as the fertilizer fuel and food are backfiring on a global scale
[1:50:16.360 --> 1:50:22.120]  they're absolutely backfiring on a global scale because what the people who run this system who
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:29.080]  created the system have never really understood is how economies work how people do business
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:36.760]  how uh goods move around they've assumed that they can operate a system of total control and
[1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:42.280]  they also assume that if you press the button and shut one thing down well other things will
[1:50:42.280 --> 1:50:49.000]  continue to operate in exactly the same way as they did previously so what they've done is that
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.880]  they've closed down parts of the global economy through sanctions at the same time as they've
[1:50:55.880 --> 1:51:03.080]  tried to inflate others through money printing through currency expansion and of course at the
[1:51:03.080 --> 1:51:10.760]  same time as they've done all of this they've always thought well a bit of chaos in the system
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:17.640]  is not a bad thing because of course it works out to our advantage and of course it doesn't
[1:51:17.640 --> 1:51:23.160]  really work like that nothing actually ever works in that sort of way what is happening is that the
[1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:33.960]  vast amounts of money that have been spent produced which have flooded the world have eroded
[1:51:33.960 --> 1:51:41.160]  purchasing power they've disrupted supply chains they've distorted prices and of course the sanctions
[1:51:41.160 --> 1:51:48.600]  hand top of all of that have disrupted the supply chains even more and so goods are in short supply
[1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:55.880]  people are experiencing inflation living standards are falling they're collapsing
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:52:02.360]  in country after country after country and of course people are protesting and who are they
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:07.800]  protesting they're protesting against precisely the governments which have implemented these
[1:52:07.800 --> 1:52:14.440]  policies which the people who are if you like the globalists have relied upon so it's been a
[1:52:14.440 --> 1:52:21.240]  massive blowback and we see political crisis I mean you identified Robert and Alex did country
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:27.080]  after country where we see political crises we see this in Britain we see this I think now in
[1:52:27.080 --> 1:52:32.280]  Germany it's coming over the horizon in Germany we see this in Italy we see this in Canada we see
[1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:38.120]  this in Panama we see a total economic collapse in Sri Lanka we're going to see much more of this
[1:52:38.680 --> 1:52:46.280]  because governments are weak because globalists have made them so and without strong governments
[1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:53.800]  able to make strong decisions things are just going to go and continue to get worse and that's
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:53:00.440]  I'm afraid the situation that this great reset has ended up with they think that they're the
[1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:06.280]  monsters of the universe except of course that the universe is bigger than they are and they're
[1:53:06.280 --> 1:53:12.120]  losing control and they're pulling everybody down with them at the same time that they're losing
[1:53:12.120 --> 1:53:18.600]  this control and Alex is part of the an entity and insanity we've witnessed over the past six
[1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:25.160]  months one of them you've documented in detailed in your daily videos at Alex Christopher is the
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:30.360]  clown world that just continue to proliferate where the hardest choice of the day is to figure out
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:34.920]  which clown world to highlight whether it's the Biden administration not being able to spell the
[1:53:34.920 --> 1:53:41.320]  word person or spelling it like peon or spelling it like peasant uh kind of revelatory or whether
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:46.040]  it's all the crazy russian things that have been banned not just tennis players and chess players
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:53.320]  and symphony players but old novelist prior music even cats in trees have been banned because they're
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:54:01.400]  russian what have been some of your favorite clown worlds in the past several months oh god that's
[1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:06.760]  that's a great question i think banning the letter z that was a great one especially because
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:12.920]  zolensky well you're essentially banning zolensky's name so ukraine banning the letters he actually
[1:54:12.920 --> 1:54:19.320]  that was germany that kicked that off germany was uh was there was a province in germany that
[1:54:19.320 --> 1:54:23.400]  actually banned the letter z and they kicked off the whole chain reaction and then you had
[1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:27.800]  entire countries i believe it was lithuania or lafia that actually banned the letter z that
[1:54:27.800 --> 1:54:32.520]  one was great i think robert you came up with one of the classic ones which was uh general
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:41.000]  pavil which was which was a story that the uk tabloids were reporting on every day this russian
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:46.120]  general because the generals were dying you know every single day putin was losing a general in
[1:54:46.120 --> 1:54:51.720]  the war and so he had to dig deep into his bench and he found this general pavil guy he was going
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:57.880]  to be the new general for this war and the guy ended up being like a border patrol guard in in
[1:54:57.880 --> 1:55:05.000]  usbekistan and they dug up a photo which was like 20 years old and uh biden opolis who can forget
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  biden opolis when biden gave his speech and he said i am uh very much a greek and they used to call
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:17.960]  me joe biden opolis and that name has stuck and finally the last one robert which i i found
[1:55:17.960 --> 1:55:25.240]  absolutely hilarious was the goat of kiev not the ghost of kiev which kindlinger was dumb enough to
[1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:32.600]  retweet but the goat of kiev which was this goat that set off a tripwire and and supposedly took
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:39.320]  out a whole uh russian brigade or something like that the story was just fantastical uh
[1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:43.960]  extraordinary now alex can you tell everybody where people can find you and alexander
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:51.320]  yes you can find us the doran dot locals dot com that is where we put all of our content

[1:56:37.960 --> 1:56:42.680]  and globalist preferences if you want independent information about what's happening in the world
[1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:48.040]  and how it might impact you here at home in the united states or wherever you may be the place to go
[1:56:48.040 --> 1:56:54.440]  is the doran dot locals dot com or find them at any of the other platforms that alex mentioned
[1:56:54.440 --> 1:57:00.680]  remember everybody you are the key to info wars surviving you are the key to independent free
[1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:06.920]  press surviving there is a law fair war going on against alex jones and info wars right now
[1:57:06.920 --> 1:57:13.400]  that is part and parcel of a bigger cancel culture censorship suppression effort we've seen it with
[1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:19.000]  ukraine talking about uh putting people on watch list and putting people on you you're not allowed
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:25.160]  to talk about this list and put it be a wide range of people but it's not just there it is all over
[1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:32.120]  the place and that is why the key is for you to continue to hold the line because you are the

[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:16.920]  someone who can make economic information both accessible and actionable and he had the inspired
[2:00:16.920 --> 2:00:22.840]  vision or whatever else you may call it to be involved in a case i'm helping bringing to sue
[2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:27.800]  the federal reserve maybe that's why he left the country briefly but we'll be talking about that
[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:34.120]  and other factors with the one and only george gaming george welcome to the show hey thanks
[2:00:34.120 --> 2:00:38.760]  for having me robert good to be here so george we're in an extraordinary economic environment
[2:00:38.760 --> 2:00:44.600]  break it down on your youtube videos on a regular basis and at rebel capitalists we can find online
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:51.960]  and as well on youtube in terms of it's out that maybe it wasn't such a genius idea to double the
[2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:57.720]  amount of currency in a year maybe it wasn't such a great idea to create lockdowns that have
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:02.760]  continuous supply chain problems that maybe it was the globalist who took the bait not
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:07.560]  putin who took the bait by going into ukraine because the sanctions appear to be backfiring on
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:13.800]  us not on russia at least if the ruble is any measurement what do you think how much did printing
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:19.000]  all of the money how much is that the real source of our inflation issues and the lockdowns so much
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:24.520]  part of our supply side issues today well it's simple robert when you look at what creates
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:33.000]  consumer price inflation and that's simply when you increase demand or you decrease supply it's
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:40.520]  just basic economics 101 so what the central planners did back in 2020 and in 2021 is they
[2:01:40.520 --> 2:01:47.000]  did both they increased demand while decreasing supply and that they sat back and said well don't
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:53.000]  worry about inflation well now we're feeling the effects of what the central planners did
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:58.440]  as a response to what we call the surveys of sickness you know the mainstream media likes
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:05.720]  to say that what we're seeing now in terms of price hikes is all a result of putin or its result of
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:13.000]  covid and it's it's not it's a result of their response to these things so if they would not
[2:02:13.000 --> 2:02:19.320]  have issued those sanctions to your point we would not see gas prices as high as they are today
[2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:24.520]  if they would not have quote unquote printed all of this money and sent out stimmy checks while at
[2:02:24.520 --> 2:02:31.240]  the same time crushing supply through destroying supply chains or that will take a long long time
[2:02:31.240 --> 2:02:36.280]  to come back and they destroyed these supply chains by locking everyone in a cage for a year or in
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:42.520]  some cases longer we would not have had the significant consumer prices increases that we've
[2:02:42.520 --> 2:02:49.160]  seen you know now over nine percent which is what the cpi states and as you know that's wildly under
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:56.200]  stated and the fed is coming out today pretty much as we speak and they're going to raise rates again
[2:02:56.200 --> 2:03:02.280]  to try to combat inflation and they're doing this while the yield curve the twos and tens which is
[2:03:03.000 --> 2:03:10.200]  got about a 95 percent accuracy in terms of predicting recession is inverted and it's not
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:14.680]  just the twos and tens that are inverted i could explain that further if you want me to but it's
[2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:22.600]  also the one-year treasury the yield is higher than the ten-year and now the six-month treasury
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:29.880]  is yield higher than the ten-year yield so these are all things that tell us that a recession is
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:36.200]  coming while at the same time the fed is increasing interest rates to try to bring down the consumer
[2:03:36.200 --> 2:03:43.480]  price increases that they themselves created back in 2020 and the response to covid and more
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:49.880]  recently to your point the response to russia ukraine it's insane when we come back after the
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:55.400]  break we'll break down are we facing a potential stock bubble collapse are we facing a potential
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:01.160]  housing price collapse are we facing future economic problems that are produced by as
[2:04:01.160 --> 2:04:06.520]  george has identified an extended ideology that the great reset is just the recreation of an older
[2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:11.560]  script that dates all the way back to the club of rome in terms of an idea of trying to control
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:17.240]  people and control the population in ways that is going to be counterproductive and self-destructive
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:22.280]  for sovereignty freedom and liberty in america we'll also discuss where you got the inspired idea
[2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:27.800]  to go after the federal reserve to expose what their real books are their real documents are
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:31.560]  and we'll discuss part of the status of that suit when we come back after the break
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:36.040]  you can find him at george gammon just search george gammon on youtube you can find him in
[2:04:36.040 --> 2:04:41.400]  a rebel capitalist and we'll discuss both of those things when we come back remember as always folks
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:46.840]  you are the front line that keeps info wars alive you are the front line that allows independent
[2:04:46.840 --> 2:04:52.920]  information of independent sources to be heard by you so hold the line support info wars go to
[2:04:52.920 --> 2:04:59.640]  info or store dot com we'll be back right after the break the globalist great reset or the war
[2:04:59.640 --> 2:05:05.320]  for the world is here but humanity is not being caught flat-footed because of info wars and because
[2:05:05.320 --> 2:05:11.560]  of your support ladies and gentlemen it is now more important than ever as we reach the critical
[2:05:11.560 --> 2:05:17.400]  heart of the battle that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people
[2:05:17.400 --> 2:05:23.720]  like you've never done before we have come so far together please help keep us from the year
[2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:28.120]  we're under massive attack right now but we're going to win with your help we're going to overcome
[2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:33.880]  this with your help and with god's blessing please go to info wars store dot com and get this book
[2:05:33.880 --> 2:05:38.760]  many many many years of research have gone into this the great reset and the war for the world
[2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:44.280]  available right now at info wars store dot com there's also signed copies available as well
[2:05:44.280 --> 2:05:48.920]  we got a lot of their big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well but
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:53.560]  this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the world
[2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:57.000]  of the globalist plan get the great reset at info wars store dot com
[2:06:02.840 --> 2:06:08.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show this is robert barnes in the bottom half of the hour
[2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:14.760]  we'll be discussing whether or not joe biden plans to use a hail mary by indicting donald trump in
[2:06:14.760 --> 2:06:20.280]  the district of columbia and whether or not the judge in the alex jones trial lied to the jury
[2:06:20.280 --> 2:06:26.920]  about what libel law really is but now we're with george gamut discussing the future of american
[2:06:26.920 --> 2:06:32.520]  and global economics given how the central planners are doing their best job to implode it on all of
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:38.760]  us in the near short term and maybe uh for it maybe even the future if we don't find ways to
[2:06:38.760 --> 2:06:43.480]  reverse it as well as later on we'll be discussing with george suing the federal reserve in the
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:48.520]  coming suit coming after labor day this year known as george gamut versus the federal reserve
[2:06:48.520 --> 2:06:55.160]  but until then uh let's first what do you think the probabilities are of a housing market collapse
[2:06:55.160 --> 2:07:01.480]  a stock market collapse because you look at what the fed is doing and as as some mutual
[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:06.520]  friends of ours have been pointing out the voker mythology that the fed really controlled inflation
[2:07:06.520 --> 2:07:11.720]  is likely more myth than reality what if it turns out they're wrong and they're not able to reduce
[2:07:11.720 --> 2:07:16.200]  inflation because it turns out you can't put the genie back in the box again after printing all of
[2:07:16.200 --> 2:07:21.720]  this money and instead all they really do is blow up the housing market and blow up the stock market
[2:07:21.720 --> 2:07:26.600]  what is the risk that we face that and what is the risk that we don't face a recession but is there
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:33.800]  a risk we face actually a depression level economics moving forward yes there's absolutely a risk of
[2:07:33.800 --> 2:07:39.400]  that i think the risk is incredibly high and i think it's all a matter of nuance i mean we talk
[2:07:39.400 --> 2:07:45.880]  about a housing crash let's start there housing market doesn't usually crash like we think of the
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:53.080]  stock market in other words the stock market can go down by 20 30 percent in two or three weeks
[2:07:53.080 --> 2:07:59.880]  we've seen that many times but for the housing market to go down it usually takes years we go
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:06.920]  back to the gfc and it peaked out in 2006 and then it bottomed out in 2012 before it started to
[2:08:06.920 --> 2:08:12.600]  quote unquote recover so the housing market takes a long time now if you're asking me can we see
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:18.680]  in a period over the next year or two where nominal prices start to come down i i think
[2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:26.760]  absolutely yes in fact today i did a story on how the sales have decreased nationwide by 20 percent
[2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:31.400]  now it doesn't necessarily mean that prices are coming down but this could be a leading indicator
[2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:37.400]  that would imply that in 2023 there's going to be downward pressure on prices and obviously
[2:08:37.400 --> 2:08:42.040]  they can come down in real terms when you're actually adjusting for the rate of inflation so if
[2:08:42.040 --> 2:08:47.720]  your house goes up by let's say five percent but the inflation is at ten you're still losing five
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:53.160]  percent purchasing power so in real terms it's come down now moving over to the stock market
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:59.960]  we've seen that it's very close if not in a bear market whether you're looking at the dow the s&p
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:06.760]  the nasdaq the russell and so to think that we could further this bear market the answer is
[2:09:06.760 --> 2:09:13.160]  absolutely unequivocally yes especially the fed continues this battle with inflation and if they
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:18.040]  continue to reduce the size of their balance sheet by doing something called quantitative tightening
[2:09:18.040 --> 2:09:25.160]  this is basically the opposite of quantitative easing and if you set up a chart of the s&p 500
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:31.640]  and you layer that over the fed's balance sheet there's a very high correlation in other words
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:37.720]  when the fed is doing quantitative easing you see the stock market s&p going up when the fed is
[2:09:37.720 --> 2:09:42.760]  doing quantitative tightening then you see the stock market flattening out and going down
[2:09:42.760 --> 2:09:51.000]  the fed just started their qt or their tightening process in june of this year so while the fed
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:55.480]  is raising interest rates while they're doing quantitative tightening while we could be or
[2:09:55.480 --> 2:10:00.760]  what the yield curve is telling us so we could not only be facing a recession but a significant
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:07.080]  a deep prolonged recession i think the probability is very high that the stock market comes down
[2:10:07.080 --> 2:10:13.000]  in nominal terms as well so then the question robert becomes what happens to purchasing power and i'm
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:19.560]  someone that believes the us economy is heavily dependent on asset prices for the purchasing
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:25.640]  power of average americans in aggregate total so what i mean by that is you can imagine if the
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:31.240]  stock market came down by 50 percent from where it is today and let's just assume for a moment
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:36.760]  that we could wave a magic wand in the housing market did the exact same thing and it did so
[2:10:36.760 --> 2:10:43.080]  within the span of six months and let's just say that over the next three or four five years it
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:50.200]  doesn't recover we go into a japan type scenario in 1990 where the asset prices went down by call it
[2:10:50.200 --> 2:10:57.480]  50 60 percent and they they literally didn't recover for over a decade even in nominal terms
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:03.000]  so think what that would do to the us economy and the average consumer when you think about
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:09.480]  what what a healthy economy entails it's really when you are producing more than you consume
[2:11:10.200 --> 2:11:16.920]  and think about the level of consumption that we as americans have had in excess of what we consume
[2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:22.680]  due to stimulus checks and due to the fact that these asset prices have been in a bubble and
[2:11:22.680 --> 2:11:28.200]  that bubble continues to get larger and larger and larger and larger i just read a statistic the
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:37.080]  other day on cnbc that the average millennials net worth has increased by uh by a hundred percent
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:42.680]  over the last two or three years and so you know not to poke fun at the millennials but i thought
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:46.600]  okay well is that because of that their stimmy checks increased their checking balance from
[2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:54.360]  five hundred dollars to a thousand dollars but it turns out no no no it's about that their average
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:58.680]  net worth went up to something like a hundred or a hundred and twenty thousand dollars and this is a
[2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:05.800]  direct result of the fact that housing went up by such a significant degree so you think about
[2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:12.360]  what that has done to the overall purchasing power for the united states or consumers in
[2:12:12.360 --> 2:12:18.440]  aggregate total what that does to demand i think it increased their net worth by something like four
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:25.000]  five trillion dollars so you're adding a lot of purchasing power into the economy that wouldn't
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:30.440]  otherwise be there so now let's back up to what we were saying earlier and if we see the housing
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:35.560]  market start to go down in nominal terms even if it's not an outright crash let's say it starts to
[2:12:35.560 --> 2:12:41.080]  go down by 10 15 per cent per year that's not even including the rate of inflation and you get the
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:46.440]  stock market coming down as well and because we're going into recession you see unemployment start to
[2:12:46.440 --> 2:12:54.840]  go up so we go from a labor shortage to a labor surplus this could really really impact the average
[2:12:54.840 --> 2:13:01.800]  consumer and as the united states economy is 70 consumption that could put us into a tailspin
[2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:08.040]  kind of a feedback loop where a recession causes asset prices to go down those asset prices going
[2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:14.760]  down decreases purchasing power which puts us further or deepens the actual recession itself
[2:13:14.760 --> 2:13:21.000]  and then we go right back into this this cycle so these are are my concerns right now for the
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:25.960]  u.s economy there are no certainties there are only probabilities but if you look at the euro
[2:13:25.960 --> 2:13:31.240]  dollar future curve which i'm happy to talk about or if you look at the treasury curve this and this
[2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:36.680]  is the smart money by the way this is predicting that we'll not only have a recession but we'll
[2:13:36.680 --> 2:13:43.160]  have an extreme recession something similar to potentially what we saw during the gfc now it's
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:49.000]  not going to be the same type of crisis because you rarely have the same type of crisis within
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:56.360]  like a 50 year time frame but the net result what the yield curves that's what they're predicting
[2:13:56.360 --> 2:14:03.160]  is that net result will be the same and for the one of the key organizations that's at the center
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:07.320]  piece of a lot of these policies that have caused a lot of these problems is the federal reserve
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:11.720]  you've decided to take on the federal reserve we've been part of a one year long project trying
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:16.280]  to get them to disclose their secret books their secret files all the information that led to
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:19.960]  their governing decisions they've been playing games so it looks like we're gonna have to file
[2:14:19.960 --> 2:14:25.320]  suit and our right to file suit is coming very soon what inspired you to take on the federal reserve
[2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:32.040]  to get this information out to the people well a personal story it was just a dinner that you
[2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:38.920]  and i had in las vegas we're enjoying a nice steak dinner with some good whiskey and we were talking
[2:14:38.920 --> 2:14:44.200]  about what the federal reserve did in 2020 specifically my memory serves me right robert
[2:14:44.200 --> 2:14:51.880]  and i this had me very concerned because you look at the federal reserve act and this is basically
[2:14:51.880 --> 2:14:57.480]  like the constitution for the federal reserve meaning that it's meant to constrain the central
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:15:03.240]  planners and you and i always talk about how it's important that we remain a country of law
[2:15:03.240 --> 2:15:09.800]  and not of men and you look at these special purpose vehicles that the feds set up during
[2:15:09.800 --> 2:15:17.640]  march of 2020 to buy corporate debt as an example and this is they can't do that that's uh it might
[2:15:17.640 --> 2:15:22.120]  not technically be in there but you'd know the legal terms if you want to follow the spirit
[2:15:22.120 --> 2:15:29.480]  of the law i mean it's not even close to within their legal rights as to what they can do so we
[2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:34.120]  had this conversation i said well we got to hold their feet to the fire how do we do this is there
[2:15:34.120 --> 2:15:39.800]  a way that we can do a foyer request to see what they did and then expose that to the public and
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:44.520]  maybe take it further if we need to and you said yes they're absolutely away and that's what got us

[2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:04.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:17.720]  after being deleted by youtube and social media in 2018 most people
[2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:25.160]  did nothing to defend alex jones or info wars instead they obediently learned the new rules
[2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:31.960]  and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil as a result things have only gotten worse
[2:20:31.960 --> 2:20:39.000]  for everyone and without any recourse they are about to get much worse alex jones is now patient
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:46.600]  zero for america's new de facto justice system brought to you by the fear complacency and inaction
[2:20:46.600 --> 2:20:53.480]  of the people because we take it here's how we can all expect to now be treated even though jones
[2:20:53.480 --> 2:20:59.880]  never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction alex jones is being sued for
[2:20:59.880 --> 2:21:06.840]  defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered
[2:21:06.840 --> 2:21:13.720]  at sandy hook elementary school the rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents and the legal team
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:20.520]  is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby who have admitted their intention
[2:21:20.520 --> 2:21:27.480]  is to silence alex jones so with this new precedent if you dare question the official narrative say
[2:21:27.480 --> 2:21:34.440]  for example the school shooting in uvaldi texas then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional
[2:21:34.440 --> 2:21:41.080]  distress but it only gets worse the plaintiffs claim that alex jones was the perpetrator of the
[2:21:41.080 --> 2:21:47.720]  sandy hook crisis actor conspiracy theory which is demonstrably false after all the censorship
[2:21:47.720 --> 2:21:54.840]  and deleted videos one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds
[2:21:54.840 --> 2:22:02.200]  of sources all questioning the official narrative of sandy hook it was arguably the most discussed
[2:22:02.200 --> 2:22:10.200]  conspiracy theory since 9 11 and over the course of seven years alex jones spent less than 30 minutes
[2:22:10.200 --> 2:22:16.520]  discussing it we know this because it's all part of the public record but these radical judges do
[2:22:16.520 --> 2:22:21.720]  not care about evidence i am not currently representing alex jones so i am free to speak
[2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:27.640]  my mind they're already apparently i've heard that the plaintiffs lawyers are complaining
[2:22:28.520 --> 2:22:33.400]  about me speaking out about the case that's how corrupt these plaintiffs lawyers are their
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:39.160]  political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other
[2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:44.760]  people's political rights and i find it disgusting what they've done and so but in this particular
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:49.480]  context jones has produced more discovery than anybody i can't find anyone that produced more
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:54.920]  discovery than he is and yet they pretended that he didn't why because they built their whole case
[2:22:54.920 --> 2:23:03.000]  on a big lie both judge gamble in texas and judge bellis in connecticut have found alex jones guilty
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:08.920]  without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence which is worse treatment than anyone
[2:23:08.920 --> 2:23:15.800]  has ever gotten in america including charles manson and al capone and their excuse for this
[2:23:15.800 --> 2:23:21.160]  abomination of justice is they claim that jones failed to provide them with the incriminating
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:28.120]  evidence that they imagine must exist whatever that mysterious unspecified evidence is
[2:23:28.840 --> 2:23:34.920]  both judges have stripped jones of his first amendment right but judge gamble has gone much
[2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:42.600]  further judge maya gamble comes from cps who has been exposed for human trafficking and working
[2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:49.800]  with pedophiles gamble helped publish cps propaganda praising the state's authority and advising
[2:23:49.800 --> 2:23:56.760]  parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care in the alex
[2:23:56.760 --> 2:24:04.040]  jones case judge gamble has ordered that the words first amendment and free speech cannot be used
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:11.720]  by alex jones his witnesses or even his lawyers he is not allowed to defend himself judge gamble
[2:24:11.720 --> 2:24:16.840]  has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the
[2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:23.000]  mass murderer who killed the children they are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:29.800]  by the words of alex jones and during jury selection not a single juror thought the media
[2:24:29.800 --> 2:24:37.560]  has ever treated alex jones or info wars unfairly and any juror who questioned the 100 million dollar
[2:24:37.560 --> 2:24:43.720]  amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury alex jones
[2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:49.960]  was canceled from social media in 2018 and is now being canceled from the us bill of rights
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:57.080]  and constitution and because of our complacency everyone else is next and in case you were wondering
[2:24:57.080 --> 2:25:03.880]  the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty it relied upon the
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:10.360]  burden of proof and it was pretty good reporting for info wars this is greg reese
[2:25:14.760 --> 2:25:21.080]  welcome back to the alex jones show robert barnes hosting today alex barrenson went on twitter
[2:25:21.080 --> 2:25:27.720]  and said anybody who defends alex jones he's gonna block this is the grifter and liar and fraud alex
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:33.000]  barrenson who raised money to support his suit against twitter promising he would never settle
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:37.640]  until and unless he got discovery and then what did he do he settled without getting publicly
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:43.080]  disclosed discovery because he's a liar and a fraud this is a guy who repeats every war whore
[2:25:43.080 --> 2:25:48.600]  warmongering pitch he's ever heard this is a guy who lied about robert malone this is a guy who
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.640]  attacked anybody who supported ibermectin just because he got one or two things right doesn't
[2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:59.160]  mean he's generally a reliable source generally he is a lot less reliable than alex jones has been
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:04.440]  and if he's going to go around attacking people for defending alex jones's right to do process of
[2:26:04.440 --> 2:26:10.520]  law right to trial by jury a right established at the foundation of our country he should at least
[2:26:10.520 --> 2:26:15.080]  try to get a few things right for a guy who's been too busy grifting and defrauding his own
[2:26:15.080 --> 2:26:20.360]  customer base to support a suit that he didn't push like he said and promised he would as the
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:26.600]  condition for raising that money so indeed people with logs in their eyes shouldn't be going around
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:32.360]  trying to spot the specs in other people's eyes but this is part of a pattern the judge in the
[2:26:32.360 --> 2:26:38.600]  sanny hook case here in austin texas concerning alex jones we i would love to show you what she
[2:26:38.600 --> 2:26:44.920]  said to the jury but she's not allowing that only the media outlets that she chooses are allowed to
[2:26:44.920 --> 2:26:51.080]  republish or rebroadcast any aspect of a trial that the public has a right to access so while
[2:26:51.080 --> 2:26:56.200]  that judge is depriving people of their constitutional right to publicly access the trial what does she
[2:26:56.200 --> 2:27:01.880]  have to hide well maybe her own prior history as a lawyer involved with child protective services
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:08.680]  and all that entails so or what's happening in the courtroom why is this judge scared for the
[2:27:08.680 --> 2:27:14.040]  world to see what is happening in the courtroom unless she controls the broadcast and publication
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:20.440]  of it maybe because of what she actually did the other day so as part of alex jones's defense
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:28.760]  the defense lawyer got up and said that alex jones had repeatedly profusely quite uh on his knees
[2:27:28.760 --> 2:27:35.160]  to the world effectively apologized again and again and again and again for anything and
[2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:40.280]  everything he got wrong in the sanny hook context do you remember the new york times apologizing
[2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:45.000]  for getting uh getting us involved in war after war after war after war after war after war do
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:49.800]  you remember cnn apologizing for anything that they've done that's led to the deaths of tens of
[2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:55.800]  millions of people around the globe no alex jones didn't cause any deaths at all all he got wrong
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:01.880]  was a few items and he publicly admitted to that on a public confessional on a public confessional
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:07.400]  tour so why does the judge not want the jury to hear that information well what the judge did is
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:13.160]  the judge not only struck that from the record the judge told the jury that texas law under
[2:28:13.160 --> 2:28:19.720]  defamation law doesn't allow an apology to be used for mitigation of damages well that's kind
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:26.280]  of odd because texas law says the exact opposite of what the judge said what texas law specifically
[2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:32.840]  states is that indeed an apology can be admissible evidence that should be admitted in the court to
[2:28:32.840 --> 2:28:37.800]  mitigate it this is part of the railroading of alex jones the weaponized law fair that involves the
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:43.000]  denial of due process and the denial of a right to trial by jury that should concern all americans
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  especially someone like alex baronson who should be more worried about refunding the donors he
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  scammed than attacking alex jones supporters in the court of public opinion the globalist

[2:33:07.240 --> 2:33:25.960]  you are listening to an infowars.com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[2:33:25.960 --> 2:33:27.320]  you are the resistance
[2:33:27.320 --> 2:33:34.600]  we are back this is the alex jones show robert barns hosting
[2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:40.440]  in this segment we will be discussing with richard barris what the polling and public
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:46.600]  opinion data really shows later on we will be discussing whether or not as a hail mary
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:54.280]  biden plans to indict donald trump anytime soon but first with richard barris you can find richard
[2:33:54.280 --> 2:34:00.200]  barris at people's pundit daily you can find people's pundit locals.com you can find people's
[2:34:00.200 --> 2:34:05.640]  pundit on rumble and while it's still last on youtube and some other platforms until they
[2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:10.360]  finally completely and utterly remove them for speaking truth to power richard barris has been
[2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:15.720]  the most accurate pollster consistently for elections going on the better part of a decade
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:20.680]  since he's entered the business and for that reason has been attacked and defamed by many of the
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:25.640]  institutional gatekeepers concerning public opinion because they often don't want you to know what
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:31.640]  real public opinion holds. richard was ahead of the curve predicting consistently the collapsing
[2:34:31.640 --> 2:34:37.240]  approval ratings of joe biden weeks or sometimes months before the institutional media would confess
[2:34:37.240 --> 2:34:42.200]  the same and has been consistently accurate calling a wide range of elections for a long
[2:34:42.200 --> 2:34:47.800]  period of time consistently the most accurate election after election year after year cycle
[2:34:47.800 --> 2:34:53.000]  after cycle so that's why we're here to discuss with richard what's coming up for november what's
[2:34:53.000 --> 2:34:59.080]  coming up in august in arizona uh in the senate primaries and what the real political opinions
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:04.680]  are on issues like abortion and free speech and alex jones uh richard glad you could make it
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:09.640]  hey thanks for having me robert it's good to be here with you my friend as always
[2:35:09.640 --> 2:35:15.000]  absolutely so in terms of the politics of abortion as an example there's been a lot of
[2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:20.360]  institutional uh complaints or statements that hey you know the republicans are really going to get
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:24.600]  hit they're really going to get hurt because of rovey wade's reversal and sending it back to the
[2:35:24.600 --> 2:35:29.320]  states the american people all love abortion they want abortion to be as long and as often
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:34.360]  and as frequent as possible uh that the that's where the public consensus is and that there'll
[2:35:34.360 --> 2:35:40.040]  be this mass turnout of young democrats enraged at the denial of their rights to an abortion
[2:35:40.040 --> 2:35:46.680]  is that in fact what the american people believe that's like a 30 year old argument robert uh you
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:51.080]  know the problem with uh and republicans should understand this when they'd be able to fight back
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:55.800]  and use abortion to their advantage but the truth is that's the same argument you know they constructed
[2:35:55.800 --> 2:36:01.320]  this box in the 1990s for us to all have this debate in uh but the truth is abortion voters
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:08.120]  aren't young anymore robert they're not young the 1990 youth voter is now like me a 40 year old
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:14.520]  middle age voter uh these are what we're calling the news cycle democrats it does you know tend to
[2:36:14.520 --> 2:36:19.720]  influence uh you know their views on what's their most important issue it really changes with the
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:24.600]  news cycle abortion is the latest one but two months ago it would have been the war in ukraine
[2:36:24.600 --> 2:36:28.280]  they would have changed their mind and would have told you it was the war in ukraine a week before
[2:36:28.280 --> 2:36:34.040]  the rovey wade decision it would have been gun safety uh so you know that these voters vote
[2:36:34.040 --> 2:36:40.200]  anyway that's the truth of it uh they hold post grad degrees they're typically uh the overly educated
[2:36:40.200 --> 2:36:45.800]  as we refer to them they're going to vote anyway so younger voters that don't really think about
[2:36:45.800 --> 2:36:51.720]  this stuff the way we did in the 80s and the 90s especially in the 90s you know when the pro-choice
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:57.560]  designation had massive double digit leads uh that's just not the case anymore month to month
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:37:04.440]  pro-life and pro-choice are pretty much split and aside from gallup i would put our record you know
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:09.640]  a second to nobody they just gallop has a longer track record of doing this but we've been pulling
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:15.000]  this issue in depth for a very long time and and views on abortion are much more complicated
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:20.520]  than the media you know wants to portray them and is it in fact the case that a majority of americans
[2:37:20.520 --> 2:37:28.440]  in pretty much every state favor limiting abortion until the uh the once a baby has a heartbeat and
[2:37:28.440 --> 2:37:34.120]  there's brain activity and it's you know past 12 weeks is there majority support for an abortion
[2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:39.720]  at that point after the 12 week time period after a heartbeat after uh brain development
[2:37:39.720 --> 2:37:46.680]  is taking place in america yeah not not not at all so the more obviously different stages
[2:37:46.680 --> 2:37:52.040]  opposition to abortion grows as you get through different stages the different trimesters uh but
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:56.440]  with the advent of the heartbeat bill for instance in texas we started saying that using that term
[2:37:56.440 --> 2:38:02.680]  once a baby uh once a heartbeat is is uh able to be detected you know it's interesting about that
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:06.760]  and people can go see this on our locals page they can go find this polling well we'll show
[2:38:06.760 --> 2:38:11.400]  you the difference between pro-life and pro-choice voters when somebody tells you they're pro-life
[2:38:11.400 --> 2:38:16.040]  they're pro-life and when you ask them whether they support or oppose abortion in different
[2:38:16.040 --> 2:38:21.000]  varying stages of the pregnancy their views are are much more considerate consistent than somebody
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:24.920]  who tells you that they're pro-choice somebody can tell you they're pro-choice and then when you
[2:38:24.920 --> 2:38:29.640]  ask them whether they support abortion after a heartbeat has been detected they're going to lose
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:34.680]  about a third of that pro-choice vote right at that period where the heartbeat has been detected
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:40.040]  when you get into the second trimester they start to lose near majority when you get into the third
[2:38:40.040 --> 2:38:46.200]  then they start to lose almost super majorities of their own vote so you know the the truth is
[2:38:46.200 --> 2:38:50.840]  science has not been kind to the abortion industry over the last two three decades
[2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:56.040]  and people's views on abortion change they want it limited even people will tell you their pro-choice
[2:38:56.040 --> 2:39:00.920]  and tell you that it shouldn't be outlawed completely what they mean robert is within
[2:39:00.920 --> 2:39:08.120]  weeks it's like soon a biden voter in austin or dallas excuse me a biden voter in dallas a female
[2:39:08.120 --> 2:39:15.400]  uh who who was uh middle age is pretty good way to to explain her to describe her she told us
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:20.360]  that she still opposed abortion after a heartbeat had been detected and when we asked her about it
[2:39:20.360 --> 2:39:25.320]  she said something i've never heard before but it really it was it's gonna stick with me because
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:29.480]  it was profound and she said you know when we think about it when when we think about you
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:34.920]  know people dying you're about to enter the death state life is over when the heartbeat stops beating
[2:39:34.920 --> 2:39:39.720]  we associate that with death right because i'm not gonna have brain activity after your heart
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:44.520]  you know stops beating just as we think about it with death uh you know then the point that the
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:50.840]  heart starts beating is why i think of it uh as as the beginning of life and you know i had all
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:56.920]  these years polling i had not had it explained to me like that uh but that is a supposedly pro-choice
[2:39:56.920 --> 2:40:03.960]  woman in a dallas suburb who voted for joe biden so that she's very indicative of how uh you know
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:08.760]  the modern american voter uh looks at this issue and can you also describe on guns because there's
[2:40:08.760 --> 2:40:12.680]  been discussion that the second amendment decision of the u.s supreme court and its ramifications will
[2:40:12.680 --> 2:40:18.520]  have this massive political backlash across the country it do is the second amendment a
[2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:26.120]  net political winner for republicans in november yeah there's only uh there's only downside risk
[2:40:26.120 --> 2:40:30.440]  if you uh get on board with pushing any kind of gun control measure if you're on the right
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:34.840]  the reason is all that you can do you're not going to win the middle the middle of the road
[2:40:34.840 --> 2:40:40.600]  voter who is responsible for the temporary rise in polling when when an event happens and people
[2:40:40.600 --> 2:40:45.080]  start polling and ask about stricter gun control laws there's always a temporary increase in people
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:50.520]  that will say yes i support that those people don't vote based on guns the only people who vote on
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:56.360]  gun issues are pro-second amendment voters and all you'll do is discourage them from voting or
[2:40:56.360 --> 2:41:01.480]  tick them off if you look at a race like michigan three where we polled uh out there for the there's
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:07.880]  john gibbs going against the incumbent peter uh mayor right of um a mire whatever how the the
[2:41:07.880 --> 2:41:12.680]  the department store got there were people who weren't angry that his first vote was to impeach
[2:41:12.680 --> 2:41:16.920]  donald trump maybe they didn't like it but that wasn't a deal breaker for them they weren't happy
[2:41:16.920 --> 2:41:21.400]  about the january sixth committee they don't like it but that's not again what did it for them
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:26.120]  when we were polling is when he cast that gun vote and that's when the bottom fell out from peter
[2:41:26.120 --> 2:41:31.640]  so it's a perfect example of all you can do is put yourself at risk you need to discourage your
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:36.360]  voters uh but you're not going to win anybody else over those people in the middle they're going to
[2:41:36.360 --> 2:41:39.960]  vote on inflation they're going to vote on the economy they're going to vote on something else
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:46.120]  and then guns it's not that priority robert the field and stream voter you'll piss off that's it
[2:41:46.120 --> 2:41:51.480]  exactly the little secret of abortion voting the little secret of second amendment voting
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:57.560]  is that it is a net winner for the pro life community it is a net winner for the pro second
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:02.280]  amendment community when we come back after the break with richard we'll discuss who is going to
[2:42:02.280 --> 2:42:08.520]  win the arizona republican primary who is going to prevail in november democrats are saying maybe
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:15.160]  it's close and competitive is it really what would a trump disantis take ticket look like in 2024
[2:42:15.160 --> 2:42:21.400]  and where is there any practical alternative to joe biden or are the democrats going to have to
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:27.480]  play weekend at bernie's for two more years with just weekend at biden's instead now remember

[2:47:14.440 --> 2:47:21.720]  it is surreal to actually be living inside the new world order it is bizarre to read all their
[2:47:21.720 --> 2:47:27.160]  white papers and battle plans from 50 60 70 years ago and now to see it all being implemented
[2:47:28.040 --> 2:47:33.160]  what's truly horrifying is we know what their battle plans call for in the next phase a 90
[2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:38.360]  percent forestie population of the planet they have recruited an army of control freaks and
[2:47:38.360 --> 2:47:46.120]  pedophiles and scum and criminals of every sort to build their new world order army and they have
[2:47:46.120 --> 2:47:49.720]  the big private central banks and they're funding they have the corporate media they have most of
[2:47:49.720 --> 2:47:55.160]  the courts but they don't have our hearts our minds and they don't have control your soul
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:01.080]  if we simply realize that god has the answer and reach out to god to give us discernment to lead
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:06.440]  god and direct us we are unstoppable together now info war is an unprecedented globalist attack
[2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:11.960]  i'm quite frankly proud of it even though it's very daunting but i know i have the living god
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:16.840]  inside my soul i have the power of the overcomer inside of me and so do you we're gonna win this

[2:49:16.840 --> 2:49:23.000]  welcome back to alex jones show guest host today robert barnes we're here with richard barris
[2:49:23.000 --> 2:49:27.560]  people's pundit you can find him at people's pundit daily people's pundit on twitter well
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:34.120]  he's still allowed to be there uh people's pundit on youtube and rumble and at people's pundit dot
[2:49:34.120 --> 2:49:39.720]  locals dot com where you can get all of his data including inside information before anybody
[2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:45.560]  else gets it from the most accurate public opinion pollster for the better part of a decade
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:49.800]  back that's how i found him i was looking for an accurate pollster finding somebody who had
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:54.440]  predicted things before they happened rather than tried to claim they did so after it happened
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:50:00.680]  and richard was the one on top of all of it richard uh in terms of public opinion on alex jones
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:06.200]  and you've seen some of those public opinions and from my review of it a truly impartial jury
[2:50:06.840 --> 2:50:14.040]  would on average not award 75 million dollars per person in damages indeed the average
[2:50:14.040 --> 2:50:19.880]  of jury verdict would be less than six figures with an impartial jury selected that had no
[2:50:19.880 --> 2:50:26.440]  preconceived bias going in how much of the republican base is closer to the opinions
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:32.680]  held by the alex jones audience compared to say mit romney lindsey graham and some of that crap
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:40.760]  you know it's funny uh it's and it'll get worse this time goes on arizona is actually a really
[2:50:40.760 --> 2:50:45.720]  good state to to illustrate that i mean the republican the average republican voter uh
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:50.360]  is not really represented at all by the people that are in washington that's a shrinking share of
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:55.640]  the electorate uh and and you know you know this because we've we've actually taken a look at people's
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:51:01.320]  audiences robert you know that uh and people that are more aligned with people like alex uh and and
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:05.880]  some of the other personalities out there they have the younger more diverse crowds they have the
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:11.880]  future of the party of what the republican party is going to be so you know looking at next week
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:16.840]  there will be a ton of races that are really illustrating this fight um they're you know the
[2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:22.680]  the old the gop the old establishment and they're gasping with their last dying breath i mean they
[2:51:22.680 --> 2:51:28.440]  they really are their their coalition is exceedingly older they're literally i mean there's no lack of a
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:34.040]  better word they're literally uh you know being being phased out they're they're dying breath
[2:51:34.040 --> 2:51:39.400]  and that's it and as an example what do you think will happen in the arizona republican primary
[2:51:39.400 --> 2:51:45.240]  where you have the populist candidate blake masters uh running on a lot of populist causes
[2:51:45.240 --> 2:51:50.760]  campaigning in a populist manner opposed getting further involved in the ukrainian conflict with
[2:51:50.760 --> 2:51:57.880]  no fly zones and 40 billion dollar bailouts for deep state funds etc will he prevail in the republican
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:52:03.640]  primary do you believe in the arizona primary coming up next week yeah because this was your
[2:52:03.640 --> 2:52:08.520]  idea i gotta give you credit for this this was roberts idea in states like arizona texas go check
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:15.240]  out the cd uh media big data poll that we did in arizona it's on cdm dot press look at a few things
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:20.600]  age race and generation when you look at that primary vote and you'll see that both blake masters
[2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:28.200]  and kerry lake are winning the newer more dynamic uh diverse coalition we had masters up by about 11
[2:52:28.200 --> 2:52:34.520]  and uh lake up by around 14 but honestly this is why you're seeing statements from others like data
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:39.160]  orbital out there basically saying you know the governor's race is over they're seeing what we saw
[2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:45.560]  which was as those people decided uh we had 20 percent undecided now it fell to 11 on the last
[2:52:45.560 --> 2:52:51.480]  days of interviewing uh blake masters was actually uh doing about five points better than the overall
[2:52:51.480 --> 2:52:56.600]  lead in the published poll on cd media right now kerry lake was also similarly doing about five
[2:52:56.600 --> 2:53:02.680]  points better that final day of interview robert when people decided um that's when they both started
[2:53:02.680 --> 2:53:08.360]  to run away with it i think at this point masters and lake are uh you know good luck catching them
[2:53:08.360 --> 2:53:13.400]  the only bright light again if you're a republican establishment candidates is that they're doing a
[2:53:13.400 --> 2:53:18.520]  little bit better with the older republican primary voters and they tend to be more certain to vote
[2:53:18.520 --> 2:53:23.240]  but the bottom line is they weren't winning them so at this point blake masters was still
[2:53:23.240 --> 2:53:27.560]  winning them at this point kerry lake is still they he's still out of lead with these voters so
[2:53:27.560 --> 2:53:34.600]  i just see no place where uh robeson or lamon jim lamon could catch uh you know the the more
[2:53:34.600 --> 2:53:39.320]  populist candidates it's and when you look at polling the way uh we have over years folks and you
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:46.120]  start to see those undecideds just evaporate as every day goes on and you see certain candidates
[2:53:46.120 --> 2:53:50.440]  taking the lion's share uh that's a surge i mean that's what you're looking at you're looking at a
[2:53:50.440 --> 2:53:55.400]  surge and they're coming down to a point where that last day in the governor's race robert the last
[2:53:55.400 --> 2:54:01.960]  day of interviews uh kerry lake was actually just over 50 robeson was at about 34 with people
[2:54:01.960 --> 2:54:09.720]  deciding and then uh blake masters had exceeded 35 percent with jim lamon only at 22 uh bernovich
[2:54:09.720 --> 2:54:15.320]  completely collapsed he was at 11 percent on a final day so that's a big deal and so you know
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:20.280]  what what you see on cdm reflects overall over three days of tracking but you know it when you
[2:54:20.280 --> 2:54:24.760]  see it those are surges those two candidates are surging absolutely the way i've described it is
[2:54:24.760 --> 2:54:30.040]  if you are a young republican primary voter young republican primary candidate young republican
[2:54:30.040 --> 2:54:36.040]  uh volunteer activist you need to win the alex jones voter because the alex jones voter is
[2:54:36.040 --> 2:54:40.440]  the future of the republican party those candidates that have appealed to the alex jones voter
[2:54:40.440 --> 2:54:45.080]  directly and specifically are going to be the future power base of the republican party moving
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:50.760]  forward now speaking of which in terms of coming in november uh we see the biden administration
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:56.920]  now escalating talk of indicting donald trump on completely bogus fictional charges but they
[2:54:56.920 --> 2:55:02.040]  have a corrupt grand jury process in the district of columbia a corrupt jury pool in the district
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:06.920]  of columbia as we witnessed in the steve bannon trial witnessed in other prior trials where democrats
[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:12.520]  walk and republicans get the get the guillotine what do you think what's gonna happen right now
[2:55:12.520 --> 2:55:20.040]  as of november in a trump disantis 2024 ticket and could an indictment of trump be a hail mary that
[2:55:20.040 --> 2:55:27.800]  could salvage and save the democrats uh come 2022 or 2024 you know going into the new year i remember
[2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:35.000]  the holiday uh season everybody in dc was distraught uh it was like the worst kept secret uh that
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:39.560]  basically they were terrified don trump was going to come back everybody had been looking at polling
[2:55:39.560 --> 2:55:44.680]  you had people like michael gershon former bush advisor writing articles trumps coming back stronger
[2:55:44.680 --> 2:55:49.400]  than ever you know i've always thought that this was this is a show this january 6 committee
[2:55:49.400 --> 2:55:53.800]  this is a show for the people at home nobody really believes donald trump broke any laws
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:59.160]  it is it's their last attempt to keep trump away uh from the white house because they know they can't
[2:55:59.160 --> 2:56:04.200]  beat him you've seen the polling robert well how many more people uh off the democratic bench do
[2:56:04.200 --> 2:56:08.440]  we have to add we're now adding gavin newson even though i'm skeptical of his ability to win a
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:13.000]  democratic nomination you have to win black voters in the south i don't see gavin doing that but
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:18.520]  whatever well add him because everybody else is getting crushed as weak as joe biden is
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:23.640]  he's still the weakest candidate against donald trump he he comes the closest but he's still
[2:56:23.640 --> 2:56:29.240]  losing uh the rest of them from hillary on down um you know bernie is the second strongest
[2:56:29.240 --> 2:56:34.520]  bernie sanders is the second but he's still down pretty significantly a trump to santas ticket is
[2:56:34.520 --> 2:56:40.440]  unbeatable i'll say that now um i i really believe that uh and this is somebody who didn't you know
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:45.320]  two years ago didn't believe republicans would ever win the popular vote again i think that ticket
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:51.000]  probably uh the republican ticket would would win that popular vote you know going into this
[2:56:51.000 --> 2:56:56.680]  november uh with all the talk of distractions we're in the summer folks and there's a serious
[2:56:56.680 --> 2:57:03.000]  non-response bias problem with republicans in the summer as we get closer to labor day i think the
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:08.600]  picture will change a little bit all of the indicators are showing a historic route republican
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:12.760]  leadership is doing everything they can i think to keep their win manageable they don't want a
[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:17.080]  bunch of maga people in congress then i'll have to explain themselves to them they don't want to
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:21.880]  be in the position john bainer was in uh when the tea party won for instance they don't it's it would
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:28.520]  be even worse with a maga uh you know an influx of maga freshman and you know senators and congressmen
[2:57:28.520 --> 2:57:33.080]  so i think they're trying to keep it manageable but the bottom line is robert you know the numbers
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:39.080]  i people who watch this for a long time know democrats are in historically bad territory
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:44.120]  in deep deep trouble thanks uh for richard barris you can find him at people's pundit thanks everybody

[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:33.080]  lot of hope i do i have a lot of hope in people when you travel the united states especially if

[3:00:37.800 --> 3:00:43.960]  time when i was on c-span i said one was i somebody had said we are a racist country and i said uh
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:52.440]  how can we be how can we be a racist country that's not possible there might be a few people that are
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:58.600]  hardcore racist but it's a but it's a hard word right and a strange word because it's so extreme
[3:00:59.720 --> 3:01:04.280]  and so when you go around and you're traveling this summer and i hope that you notice this there's
[3:01:04.280 --> 3:01:10.120]  no brawls you know happening in the airports there's no color there's no there's nothing if

[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:43.560]  special guest i'm ringing on for this hour and i'm so excited to do this because i just absolutely
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:48.760]  am one of her biggest fans i've had her on my show several times and i've had her here on info wars
[3:01:48.760 --> 3:01:55.720]  dr judy mykovitz joins me she is my special guest and from her doctoral thesis which changed the
[3:01:55.720 --> 3:02:02.280]  treatment of hiv aids by the way saving millions of lives including magic johnson uh her discovery
[3:02:02.280 --> 3:02:08.680]  of a new family of human retroviruses dr mykovitz has always been on the leading edge of science
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:14.520]  and her investigations questioned the use of animal tissue in medical research rightfully so think
[3:02:14.520 --> 3:02:21.160]  about that why do we have animal tissue in medical research um and is that unleashing devastating
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:26.920]  plagues of chronic disease such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome all of those kinds of
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:33.080]  things and she saw it at its worst she saw science at its worst she started her career at the national
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:39.240]  cancer institute in 1988 she became a scientist obtained a phd in biochemistry and molecular
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:46.680]  biology from george washington university in 1991 also she accuses anthony fow chi rightfully so
[3:02:46.680 --> 3:02:52.920]  head of the u.s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases a prominent member of the
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:58.040]  white house right they want to always say he's a prominent member of the white house corona task
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:05.240]  force um he is responsible for deaths occurring during those early years of hiv you'll also remember
[3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:09.880]  her from the pandemic movie she gave brilliant testimony to the lives of kovid and one of the
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:15.400]  first to speak out and also her book plague of corruption restoring faith in the promise of science
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:21.560]  also well so many books uh plague one scientist uh in trevid search for the truth about human
[3:03:21.560 --> 3:03:28.120]  retroviruses and truth about masks her amazing books i could not put them down please get them
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:34.920]  my guest dr judy mikovitz welcome to the program how are you uh nice to be with you again kate um
[3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:43.960]  importantly um your um audio isn't so good for me i'm getting a feedback and um in case
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:50.200]  audience is getting a feedback yeah jg it's a little too loud i think and so secondly i do
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:57.480]  not start my career at the national cancer institute in 1988 and interestingly they've
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:07.240]  literally rewritten my bio in order to eliminate the kind of work i really did because what's most
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:15.720]  important is i'm a nash i'm a natural products chemist um out of the university of virginia
[3:04:15.720 --> 3:04:25.080]  and um and they didn't have a degree in biochemistry that's how old i am when i when i started at
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:32.280]  university of virginia 1976 so it's really important because so i had to get a degree
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:39.400]  in chemistry a ba i couldn't get a bachelor's science and so somehow you see them twist everything
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:46.200]  around is so let me stop you here judy we're gonna come right back hopefully we'll fix the audio
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:51.240]  we'll be right back on the alex joneshow more i'm so glad she corrected that because she's right
[3:04:51.240 --> 3:04:56.280]  they keep changing her bio be right back on the kate dally's uh i'm sorry on the alex joneshow
[3:04:56.280 --> 3:05:03.320]  with kate we are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between
[3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:11.000]  what we've known and what's to come and right now the most important thing to remember is don't panic
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:17.320]  stay calm because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe
[3:05:17.320 --> 3:05:23.960]  sound course there is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules and building
[3:05:23.960 --> 3:05:31.000]  our own society all we got to do is survive the crash and right now we still have time to prepare
[3:05:31.000 --> 3:05:37.800]  the world fiat currency system is racing towards zero it's time to convert it into hard assets
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:44.760]  now including food water and survival gear to keep us strong and at the ready go to
[3:05:44.760 --> 3:05:53.560]  preparedtoday.com for the essentials storable foods water filtration first aid power and more
[3:05:53.560 --> 3:06:04.680]  at preparedtoday.com welcome back to the alex joneshow and kate dally your guest host for the hour
[3:06:04.680 --> 3:06:09.480]  and a big thank you to alex uh for having me come on and and by the way my guest
[3:06:09.480 --> 3:06:16.040]  doc the great the fantastic dr judy mykovitz in fact i know you saw her in the movie pandemic
[3:06:16.040 --> 3:06:22.360]  her books truly you cannot put them down because she really goes through exactly what happened
[3:06:22.360 --> 3:06:27.560]  what she discovered in some of her medical discoveries that were so amazing i'm so glad
[3:06:27.560 --> 3:06:33.320]  you corrected that judy because there is such an onslaught of rewriting on the internet going on
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:37.720]  and trying to diminish those that speak out thank you so much for doing that actually
[3:06:38.840 --> 3:06:46.680]  and it's actually more important than diminishing me it's taking things like type one interfere on
[3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:54.680]  out of the equation because when i was a technician my job so i started june 10th 1980
[3:06:54.680 --> 3:07:02.440]  and my job was fermentation chemistry and as we tell the story in my book the um interferon
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:10.360]  was on the cover of time magazine as the big if was this the the magic bullet for cancer was the
[3:07:10.360 --> 3:07:19.240]  whole idea that was march 31st 1980 so i didn't appreciate then but i'm like at the time i wasn't
[3:07:19.240 --> 3:07:26.600]  going to medical school um i i didn't fit the listen to you um and memorize stuff and not think
[3:07:27.400 --> 3:07:33.320]  persona of an md so i wasn't going to go to medical school so i'm i'm here thinking i didn't
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:41.160]  even know there was such a thing as a phd another kind of doctor so i i i basically didn't some of
[3:07:41.160 --> 3:07:48.040]  my grades weren't so good because of of you'll see it in the book ending plague so our last book our
[3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:56.440]  latest book is called ending plague a scholar's obligation in an age of corruption and um that's
[3:07:56.440 --> 3:08:06.760]  the that's frank risetti story so when i started june 10th 1980 um i was in fermentation chemistry
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:15.000]  and i was fermenting biological response modifiers natural products like plant things red things
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:22.520]  methylene blue things that i was i was making drugs from plants that was my job we didn't have
[3:08:22.520 --> 3:08:30.200]  molecular biology at the time so and i couldn't call myself a biochemist because i was all chemistry
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:35.960]  with a specialization in biology because we didn't have biochemistry and it's important
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:43.960]  for what they want you to think because they said started 1988 and then got a phd and and so even in
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:49.800]  even in some of the articles that came out after pandemic came out one was really fun and
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:58.040]  AIDS research in human retroviruses it said something like x mrv covid and the toxic legacy
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:05.800]  of dr judy micah mitz and and i mean frank was horrified and i'm like frank it's the blueprint
[3:09:05.800 --> 3:09:12.920]  it tells you everything so when you don't care what they say about you and you try to figure out
[3:09:12.920 --> 3:09:21.320]  why they said it then you start to understand what they don't want the rest of the world to know
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:29.320]  and so what they've done with people like dr mccullough and dr malone and that the md's is
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:37.640]  they spin out these drugs like pax lovid and other things and and they demonize vitamins
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:45.960]  minerals natural products old things eat low low low low dose that's where i hold my patents
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:53.320]  in nutritional biochemistry and how to use medical drugs because i make those drugs
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:10:01.160]  as efficiently as you can in the patient population while you support the side effect
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:08.040]  with nutrition and they don't want you to know that why because you would cure cancer the magic
[3:10:08.040 --> 3:10:17.400]  bullet type one interfere on your own biological response modifier right there you we can purify
[3:10:17.400 --> 3:10:26.040]  it from cows and that's how it's made as a purified protein and so the fda won't let us label that
[3:10:26.040 --> 3:10:35.160]  a vaccine and in fact it is and so you go all the way back to 1992 and i'm on the stew petershow
[3:10:35.160 --> 3:10:41.640]  last week he asked me about that when they were experimenting on children in a text message to
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:48.040]  see if i would go on the show and i said sure but how about look at this and the look at this was
[3:10:48.040 --> 3:10:58.520]  how abc news in a like seven or ten minute clip in 1992 when i got my phd on november 14th 1991
[3:10:58.520 --> 3:11:09.640]  magic johnson was zero positive meaning he made an antibody to hiv in 19 november 7th 1991 i defended
[3:11:09.640 --> 3:11:17.720]  my phd thesis at the molecular level and biochemistry level um a week later and all my thesis committee
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:27.720]  said is based on your thesis will she or will will he or will he not get aids and what i said was
[3:11:27.720 --> 3:11:34.280]  i drew on the little chalkboard as i always do my little cpg and methylation and on off switch i said
[3:11:34.280 --> 3:11:42.120]  but he has to change everything he has to literally change everything because they had scared everybody
[3:11:42.120 --> 3:11:48.040]  and this is what mickey willis told me so you see i didn't even understand when we wrote the first
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:57.080]  book in one scientist's intrepid search for the truth about human disease causing retroviruses
[3:11:57.080 --> 3:12:05.080]  it's not human retroviruses it's disease associated or disease causing and so in that third book and
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:10.760]  you start to see oh no because mickey willis said my brother died of AIDS and i said don't you mean
[3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:17.720]  AIDS and this is 19 i sat down with him in march or april our book plague of corruption was done
[3:12:17.720 --> 3:12:26.840]  this was supposed to be a 20 minute um promotional video because nobody bought plague because it's
[3:12:26.840 --> 3:12:33.080]  hard to read and nobody really cared so you know about retroviruses most people don't know what they
[3:12:33.080 --> 3:12:39.960]  are and all they know is hiv so what you what we now know i said wait a minute don't you mean
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:46.840]  AIDS and he said no AZT because he was antibody positive so now we've tweaked in the fraudulent
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:53.960]  PCR test and we're saying tested positive and we wouldn't let anybody in covid see if they already
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:13:01.880]  had antibodies well what happened in the x mrv story well what they said was they didn't isolate
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:09.080]  natural x mrvs from people with disease and show they could be transmitted to other people and
[3:13:09.080 --> 3:13:18.200]  they would get disease that's satisfying if you will coax postulates so they flipped x mrv and said
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:26.520]  i sprinkled recombinant fairy dust oh that would be a pcr product the spike protein so you've
[3:13:26.520 --> 3:13:34.280]  amplified and contaminated they said our pcr was contaminated with mouse dna there's no such thing
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:45.640]  is xenotropic foreign m lv is what the mouse stands for murine mouse leukemia virus it causes cancer
[3:13:45.640 --> 3:13:52.680]  if you put that one peptide of the spike protein called syncytine oh wait a minute that would be
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:14:00.120]  a component of snake venom and so you start to see and and it's like do they have an antidote well
[3:14:00.120 --> 3:14:08.280]  of course they do they're not going to inject why can't you inject animal viruses why um because
[3:14:08.920 --> 3:14:16.360]  all animals have syncytine they have their own god-given viral whole bunches of viruses
[3:14:16.360 --> 3:14:23.800]  when you read plague of corruption bobby's forward he talks a lot about sv 40 simian monkey
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:32.840]  virus 40 it's the 40th virus they isolated and that variant caused associated not caused
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:40.760]  with mesothelioma a cancer of the lining of the lung so you see when you break this all down
[3:14:40.760 --> 3:14:46.600]  and you trust god and you you ask the question it's not about me so i didn't read that toxic
[3:14:46.600 --> 3:14:53.960]  legacy i said wait a minute frank so two weeks after plague of a pandemic came out they went to the
[3:14:53.960 --> 3:15:00.840]  premier retro virology meeting in the world which is called cold spring harbor oh that would be
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:07.720]  that place they did eugenics up there with watson and crick and where the lime disease came from
[3:15:07.720 --> 3:15:16.600]  would you start to see and i was only there once in 1992 and what was my work that i showed there
[3:15:16.600 --> 3:15:26.120]  from after my phd thesis that you don't need infectious virus to cause the um that the damage
[3:15:26.120 --> 3:15:32.520]  to to cause the dominoes to all fall down and cause aids because that's it doesn't cause aids
[3:15:32.520 --> 3:15:39.000]  unless you do that it's not the presence of the virus it's the expression of the virus until if
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:46.760]  you express another animal syncytine or in aborted fetal cells that we're going to come right back
[3:15:46.760 --> 3:15:51.000]  more with dr judy michael vitz on the alex jones show be right back
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:16:04.040]  there is nothing there is no more epitome of free speech than right here and that's what people
[3:16:04.040 --> 3:16:09.160]  recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not going to find a better place for

[3:20:10.440 --> 3:20:15.400]  i gotta tell you this book the great reset in the war for the world the left in the mainstream
[3:20:15.400 --> 3:20:21.960]  media are going to have to sit there and we've got to force them to respond to this book this
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:28.360]  book is that important alex jones cuts to the heart of the matter if you compare the finest
[3:20:28.360 --> 3:20:33.320]  and i'm telling you to take mit technology review you take science take all these magazines and
[3:20:33.320 --> 3:20:40.280]  journals add the electronic part of it and you know npr pbs all of it i'll take it i'll match up
[3:20:40.280 --> 3:20:45.880]  and i will go through and we'll do what alex jones put out there versus what your collective body
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:50.200]  has put out there and if you're a sent in human being and just watching it you say well got alex
[3:20:50.200 --> 3:20:54.520]  jones is ahead of this not only that you can't explain it they're just in this huge revolution
[3:20:55.320 --> 3:21:00.680]  against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:06.840]  technology that empowers humanity instead they want adoption of technology forced adoption
[3:21:06.840 --> 3:21:12.200]  world ids global social credit scores carbon taxes that that dominate and monitor every
[3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:19.320]  facet of our lives you make the case of what the not just the new world order is but using this great
[3:21:19.320 --> 3:21:25.160]  reset to really take up there's whole idea of control and authoritarianism they have decided
[3:21:25.160 --> 3:21:30.840]  to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public
[3:21:30.840 --> 3:21:36.760]  where they will be in their elysium fields there is no new technology coming in they're blocking
[3:21:36.760 --> 3:21:42.520]  that and so really they're just imploding things under the cloud pivot model show that they can
[3:21:42.520 --> 3:21:48.200]  get that control over alex jones cuts to the heart of the matter he has presented tons of valid
[3:21:48.200 --> 3:21:54.440]  evidence and facts that i think have been really really important to raising consciousness to what
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:22:01.800]  the sort of technocratic global elite really want to do the true thing that you've done
[3:22:01.800 --> 3:22:07.400]  which is stunning if you look at the evidence of that and the facts you are one of the great
[3:22:07.400 --> 3:22:12.280]  thinkers of this that is very rare you've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation
[3:22:12.280 --> 3:22:18.520]  and see that this book the great reset in the war for the world i'm telling you everybody in america
[3:22:18.520 --> 3:22:23.320]  the people that hate alex jones the most have to read this book this is no beach read you're not

[3:22:59.560 --> 3:23:06.200]  came out and said i need to educate people on the effects of the mRNA covid shots containing the
[3:23:06.200 --> 3:23:14.680]  poisonous peptide mnemonic of snake venom since since since it and uh and also this is an every
[3:23:14.680 --> 3:23:22.120]  single vaccine on the cdc schedule in fact you told me you know from 2017 on you should not
[3:23:22.120 --> 3:23:28.120]  be taking any of their shots and most importantly all well also besides for all of the um ailments
[3:23:28.120 --> 3:23:34.520]  and heart heart conditions everything else death that it's causing it also poses um danger to
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:41.160]  fertility do you want to talk about that judy oh sure yeah that's why i'm so excited about it
[3:23:41.160 --> 3:23:50.360]  because that's in cytanine or syncytine protein sy n means synthesis you synthesize cells together
[3:23:50.360 --> 3:24:00.360]  then cytan c y t i n or c y t o means cytosel so um since cytanine or syncytine i always call it
[3:24:00.360 --> 3:24:04.840]  syncytine just because it's like mica vitz with an i or mica vitz it's the same thing depending on
[3:24:04.840 --> 3:24:13.320]  what country you come from anyway since cytanine is going to fuse cells together and that in our
[3:24:13.320 --> 3:24:24.120]  or god-given genome is it is a virus our own god-given human retrovirus genome is eight percent
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:32.520]  of our of our genome that the the is is a god-given endogenous retroviruses one of them is called
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:40.680]  human endogenous retrovirus w and so that goes on the expression that on off switch i was talking
[3:24:40.680 --> 3:24:48.280]  to you about DNA methylation from latency that was my phd thesis you keep hiv quiet and you're
[3:24:48.280 --> 3:24:56.920]  just fine and you'll never get aids why you don't get the cytokine storm that very particular cytokine
[3:24:56.920 --> 3:25:05.160]  storm was nf kappa b and nf kappa b is the on off switch the transcription factor nf kappa b controls
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:15.160]  antibody production nf kappa b is inflammatory cytokine storm is is a th1 inflammatory response
[3:25:15.160 --> 3:25:24.440]  with gammon or pheron tgf beta il 6 interleukin 6 is is that is that cytokine and then chemokines
[3:25:24.440 --> 3:25:30.840]  to send fire trucks to the fire trafficking molecules so it turns on and it tells the blood
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:37.800]  stem cell what kind of fire it is is it a gasoline fire where is it in the body is it in the brain
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:47.320]  so so syncytine or syncytine is your god-given gene when that goes on you're waiting to implant
[3:25:47.320 --> 3:25:54.760]  the fertilized embryo into the uterine cell wall so when the egg is fertilized with the sperm
[3:25:54.760 --> 3:26:01.800]  that gene goes on and it's hormone driven which is why a woman with in vitro fertilization who
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:09.240]  can't have babies has to have hormone treatment first because she has to make sure that gene is
[3:26:09.240 --> 3:26:16.440]  on because once you take the test tube where you've done the fertilization because their bodies can't
[3:26:16.440 --> 3:26:23.800]  probably because they've been poisoned so many decades or generations by big pharma their their
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:30.360]  their you know they can't fertilize so you fertilize it in the lab and then you implant it but it has
[3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:37.720]  to stick that's the velcro that holds the fertilized embryo into the uterine cell wall and then when
[3:26:37.720 --> 3:26:47.160]  the baby is too big and too much RNA and DNA is going into mom half of that is non-self so she'll
[3:26:47.160 --> 3:26:54.440]  have an autoimmune reaction and she'll get disease that's rh factor when with mom and dad
[3:26:54.440 --> 3:27:00.360]  because half of it is a foreign person so you'll have an autoimmune autoinflammatory so then that
[3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:06.440]  gene goes off when the baby's that big and the baby's born and the various contractions go on i
[3:27:06.440 --> 3:27:12.360]  mean it's beautiful when you see how god works but they don't want you to know so if you put another
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:19.800]  human cincyton that's a boarded fetal cell lines if you put cow if you put pig if you put monkey
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:29.320]  if you put mouse if you put lizard cincyton that's how our body knows that you know those are all
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:37.880]  mammals that carry their young so some a snake doesn't eat the egg or whatever in the environment
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:45.400]  environment so so again if you inject another animal cincyton in every shot does this but the
[3:27:45.400 --> 3:27:53.080]  worst is they engineered it into the COVID bio weapon notice how the COVID bio weapon doesn't
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:28:02.920]  say and doesn't say vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-CoV-2 is the monkey virus and and the COVID
[3:28:02.920 --> 3:28:10.840]  19 shot is humanized the monkey's been injected for decades and it only hurt the most vulnerable
[3:28:10.840 --> 3:28:16.280]  and they knew it they were experimenting on the blacks who have great vitamin D receptors so it's
[3:28:16.280 --> 3:28:22.120]  the sensors on the surface of the cell they've been deliberately messing with and i'll tell you how
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:30.600]  to fix it and and alex jones is saying all of it everything he just said buy it i mean we've got
[3:28:30.600 --> 3:28:36.280]  get healthy store and i'm going to find out how to get his book in the get healthy store and how

[3:32:52.040 --> 3:32:58.760]  the world of the globalist plan get the great reset at infoworkstore.com leading a frontal
[3:32:58.760 --> 3:33:12.680]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones back here with you on the alex jones
[3:33:12.680 --> 3:33:18.200]  show i'm kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio dot com about six months ago attorney
[3:33:18.200 --> 3:33:23.320]  tom rance and senator ron johnson had their covet panel for the very corrupt governor uh
[3:33:23.320 --> 3:33:30.440]  government that we have presented the findings and the findings were insane 487 spike in breast
[3:33:30.440 --> 3:33:39.560]  cancer 279 spike in miscarriages a thousand percent spike in nervous system problems i'm i mean 350
[3:33:39.560 --> 3:33:47.240]  percent spike in male infertility 369 percent spike in testicular cancer and i could go on and on
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:52.680]  for all of the problems we're having with heart and everything else and so i my guess is dr judy
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:33:58.040]  mykovitz answering some of these questions and we just talked about fertility we're going to see
[3:33:58.040 --> 3:34:04.200]  fertility problems the other thing people want to know dr mykovitz is whether or not somebody
[3:34:04.200 --> 3:34:11.880]  would test positive for aids have having these shots specifically the boosters um and of course
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:16.600]  the first shot but would it take the boosters and i would love for you to answer this because
[3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:26.040]  i've been asked this many many times will you test positive for hiv um correct you will test
[3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:33.400]  positive for hiv and we're not sure which shots but as we know from our book ending plague they
[3:34:33.400 --> 3:34:40.040]  engineered into that spike protein there are three parts to it it's a little tulip and this is a paper
[3:34:40.040 --> 3:34:50.840]  they actually published in 2004 simian immune deficiency sars kov-2 is part siv part x mrv
[3:34:50.840 --> 3:35:02.520]  from the monkey the monkey since sitin and and the sars kov-2 sorry the corona virus um the sars
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:09.080]  receptor binding domain from the ace to receptor so they they made because you use that binding
[3:35:09.080 --> 3:35:15.960]  domain in the spike protein to make it aerosolized so that you breathe it in because normally
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:23.080]  retroviruses are only spread through blood and body fluids because you need pieces in parts of
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:31.960]  animal cells in order to get the pro virus unless you inject it so now you're going to test positive
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:41.880]  by pcr for hiv and if you've already been injected and you or you've already been infected
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:51.640]  either with the monkey one or with the human one by air and you've made antibodies these are
[3:35:51.640 --> 3:36:00.680]  absolutely the people who don't want to get another shot so no matter which way you got it stop the
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:11.000]  shots never get another shot because every single shot has either monkey mouse or manufactured
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:18.680]  hiv spike protein part of it's just a little peptide so it's just a few base pairs and when
[3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:26.040]  they change a base pair or two you know atc and g you know they're telling you that you're only your
[3:36:26.040 --> 3:36:31.800]  mRNA know you're your chromosomes and god's giving you everything you need and if you get those minerals
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:42.040]  see they so they depleted our soil of minerals they caused the mthfr mutation that single nucleotide
[3:36:42.040 --> 3:36:49.320]  polymorphism is epigenetics that's not the way god made us four generations back it's how long
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:55.560]  they've been injecting us and they hit the hot spot so that you get infected yeah look at every
[3:36:55.560 --> 3:37:02.760]  one of those persons so they're wearing masks so they're making themselves have an adverse reaction
[3:37:02.760 --> 3:37:09.720]  they're activating the latent viruses of that eight percent of your human virus and the ones your
[3:37:09.720 --> 3:37:16.920]  body has silenced because we don't all get sick from those shots so they loaded up the most susceptible
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:22.680]  they looked at the vitamin d they looked at the minerals they looked at the curcumin those pathways
[3:37:22.680 --> 3:37:30.760]  curcumin modulates that nf kappa b so when you start to see what the bad guys and the crimes against
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:37.560]  humanities to or what they do oh they tried to capture alex jones they tried to make alex jones
[3:37:37.560 --> 3:37:42.840]  look bad they tried to make judy mike of its and reiner fulmish might bad because reiner was
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:51.320]  testifying against um against of the pcr test which was literally fraud how you make the primers
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:58.360]  is what you detect so they find what they want to find and that's the real plague i think that's
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:06.120]  one of the last lines of our first book so you see we gave them a blueprint in our research
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:12.120]  of how to attack and poison your food and in our last in in all of our books but especially in our
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:19.320]  last book ending plague we talk about stephanie seniff's book toxic legacy it's glyphosate so
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:27.080]  when brian artist is saying the water is poison glyphosate x mrv's get into cells through a
[3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:33.400]  phosphate transporter but all your proteins the three percent of your messenger RNA that's
[3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:40.920]  translated into protein their post translation after you make the protein how do we make it fit
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:45.640]  the human's environment whether you're a black person whether you're a white person whether
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:50.440]  you live in sweden whether you live in india you eat different food you have different microbes in
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:56.920]  your water you get monazuma it's all food and it's also these are the toughest races that can live
[3:38:56.920 --> 3:39:03.880]  in blazing sun or freezing cold and god gave you that modification so the sensors it's the
[3:39:03.880 --> 3:39:09.400]  sensors on your cell surfaces and and so it's just signaling and so we're missing the minerals
[3:39:09.400 --> 3:39:14.200]  we're missing the dimethyl glycine we're missing the type one interferon because they cripple the
[3:39:14.200 --> 3:39:23.480]  pathway and they knew exactly how to do it the x mrv's integrate into hot spots in cpg it's called
[3:39:23.480 --> 3:39:29.560]  islands that's the on-off switches for your god given viruses to protect you so they get in there
[3:39:29.560 --> 3:39:43.800]  and they change them forever that mthfr m677 c677 t that's a c to t transmission the c gets
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:52.040]  regulated turn off and on the t doesn't so god did that to protect us from building up homocysteine
[3:39:52.040 --> 3:39:58.520]  and having a heart attack and die what do the shots do they cause myocarditis oh but your
[3:39:58.520 --> 3:40:05.480]  homocysteine doesn't build up because god protected us from the poison so even if we just stop today
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:10.600]  that's why i'm so excited today because i just sat down and did two and a half hours of chemistry
[3:40:10.600 --> 3:40:15.800]  said okay doc with the fabulous doc here i won't say his name and you don't know where i am
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:20.520]  except for the phone knows where i am so i had to drive i had to get up at four in the morning
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:27.480]  to get here to be with you today and to get to that meeting with him so so that but the point is so
[3:40:28.280 --> 3:40:35.640]  i'm gonna go right to my publicist and say um get alex jones books we've we put all of our books
[3:40:35.640 --> 3:40:43.160]  in the get healthy store because until the doctors can read and the real anthony fauci as well because
[3:40:43.160 --> 3:40:47.640]  what's important about the real anthony fauci i mean it's brilliant i just can't even tell you
[3:40:47.640 --> 3:40:53.160]  how brilliant it is um and i had to listen to it because my mind gets blown and i just have to turn
[3:40:53.160 --> 3:40:59.000]  it off and if i read it i'm gonna fill in the gaps of the biochemistry pathway and that won't work
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:05.560]  so i can fix it later but we'll write further volumes i hope he will um but at any rate um
[3:41:05.560 --> 3:41:14.120]  what's important about it is they don't even say the word xmrb or judy micovitz and all like this
[3:41:14.120 --> 3:41:21.400]  it said once in the book but not in the acknowledgment and that's the kudos mickey willis kudos alex
[3:41:21.400 --> 3:41:27.720]  jones kudos mic adams kudos everybody stephanie center peter mccullough robert malone because
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:34.600]  they don't want us talking to each other they don't want the md's to understand the biochemistry
[3:41:34.600 --> 3:41:41.480]  and that's why i it was said in this tour that i attacked so you can look at the other article
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:48.680]  that came right out after pandemic that one was a week and it was science magazine just go to
[3:41:48.680 --> 3:41:58.040]  sciencemag.org and search micovitz and cohen c o h e n and you'll find how the the scientific
[3:41:58.040 --> 3:42:04.280]  literature as tess lori on on del big tree show the inform consent action network as she said
[3:42:04.280 --> 3:42:11.960]  oh they they um they took the journal articles and their criminal fraud so when you start to see
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:17.640]  and they told them publish faster the negative studies on ivermectin it's a pyronergic modulator
[3:42:17.640 --> 3:42:24.520]  and they write the word they that i i'm a virologist who attacked tony fowchie no no no no i didn't

[3:46:57.320 --> 3:47:03.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:16.360]  back to the alex joneshow and kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio.com so glad
[3:47:16.360 --> 3:47:21.720]  you're joining us this is an important hour i want to learn so much from dr judy micovitz and i
[3:47:21.720 --> 3:47:25.400]  always do every time i talk with her there's a couple of things that have been happening
[3:47:25.400 --> 3:47:29.800]  everybody's been noticing all the lying all of that well lies from the beginning but all the
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:35.320]  backtracking bouchie said he never said flatten the curve cdc rachel said they had too much
[3:47:35.320 --> 3:47:41.400]  optimism and not enough caution so sorry about all those shots and then of course king fraught a lot
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:47.080]  saying that you couldn't get sick and many others after you know you took the shots and of course
[3:47:47.080 --> 3:47:52.360]  you can and they said now they've never said that so i don't know if they know that in this
[3:47:52.360 --> 3:47:56.600]  technology today we actually have video of everybody saying these things and i play them on my show
[3:47:56.600 --> 3:48:02.360]  all the time but my gosh this is getting ridiculous and so um there's a couple of questions i have
[3:48:02.360 --> 3:48:08.280]  for you and i think sometimes i think so much is going to go over my head in scientific speak
[3:48:08.280 --> 3:48:12.840]  but i know that there are certain things i'm going to take away and i'm going to understand
[3:48:12.840 --> 3:48:17.560]  from this conversation judy because you're so brilliant and you've done so much to educate
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:22.200]  and so i would like to know you know you knew you probably guessed that these lies were going to
[3:48:22.200 --> 3:48:27.640]  come back and and they were going to have to say they'd never said them what happens next with the
[3:48:27.640 --> 3:48:32.840]  shots do you feel like something is coming this fall do they have another shot sequence drip system
[3:48:32.840 --> 3:48:38.840]  i call it coming out uh what what happens this fall do you think fall and winter going into 2023
[3:48:40.200 --> 3:48:47.560]  well well i hope what happens is that people realize so we just put out a video the we is
[3:48:47.560 --> 3:48:58.760]  dr ben marble md so um at at i think myfreedoctor.com and so ben what marble just just put out a video
[3:48:58.760 --> 3:49:07.320]  of a whole bunch of doctors saying stop the shot um stop the shot and and so i talked and i also said
[3:49:07.320 --> 3:49:20.200]  i said please stop the shot all the shots because if nobody gets another shot they just lied about
[3:49:20.200 --> 3:49:28.360]  everything in the past 50 years you've been lied to you can tell now as as alex just said about
[3:49:28.360 --> 3:49:34.600]  those supplements i wrote down every one of them because i'm going to buy them and and hope that
[3:49:34.600 --> 3:49:42.440]  alex will link them to our real dr judy the real dr judy.com i'm hoping we can put them in our get
[3:49:42.440 --> 3:49:51.080]  healthy store including if not the products in our um the book because the books are so heavily
[3:49:51.080 --> 3:49:57.560]  censored that's why i said it because the doctors aren't being educated i don't want to sound it's
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:04.920]  not false humility but i'm not brilliant i'm a biochemist and a molecular biologist so that's
[3:50:04.920 --> 3:50:11.240]  why it's important that the article said she's a virologist no you practice what i discover
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:20.280]  you practice you don't get a phd unless you change the way medicine is practice so we now know
[3:50:20.280 --> 3:50:28.920]  hib doesn't cause AIDS yes we can put a banner right off the the bottom to say get these products
[3:50:28.920 --> 3:50:37.080]  or we can import them right into the company called get healthy store and dr tracy helps us do that so
[3:50:37.080 --> 3:50:42.920]  we've done that in the last six months so what everybody has to realize right now is shame on
[3:50:42.920 --> 3:50:49.240]  you if you ever get another shot at least until they're cleaned up and my initial when we were
[3:50:49.240 --> 3:50:56.840]  doing this 10 5 10 years ago when our first book came out i said a moratorium on all vaccines
[3:50:56.840 --> 3:51:03.160]  until the safety studies are done what people don't realize is every shot is warp speed why they're
[3:51:03.160 --> 3:51:11.640]  never tested none of the animal debris is ever removed and that's a 2017 paper by godi the minerals
[3:51:11.640 --> 3:51:19.560]  the graphene oxide the heavy metals they're in all the shots folks and i use that in vaccine court
[3:51:19.560 --> 3:51:25.720]  and shortly before they said judy mike of it's in frank rissetti can't give opinions in vaccine
[3:51:25.720 --> 3:51:32.840]  court and we discovered the whole thing come on we're not experts because we don't have an md
[3:51:32.840 --> 3:51:40.360]  behind our name so you see they're purposely trying to divide us but if people realize it's
[3:51:40.360 --> 3:51:48.920]  as simple as buying mineral supplements and vitamins nitric oxide is a gas they made viagra
[3:51:48.920 --> 3:51:54.280]  you know oh so they made a lot of money out of your erect erectile dysfunction after they poison
[3:51:54.280 --> 3:52:01.160]  do with glyphosate and this is why stephanie senif's book the toxic legacy is in our get healthy store
[3:52:01.160 --> 3:52:08.040]  so we tell you the causes but what i was trained to do is never tell you the cause until you have
[3:52:08.040 --> 3:52:19.720]  a solution we don't incite fear you've had vaccines all along pax immune is a vaccine for aids that's
[3:52:19.720 --> 3:52:27.080]  the drug i made in my first three years that's important i have a question for you when they
[3:52:27.080 --> 3:52:33.160]  take a sample from a sick person do they have to drag it through animal tissue animal specimens animal
[3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:46.600]  cell lines in order to figure out whether or not you're sick um no no the way they're doing
[3:52:46.600 --> 3:52:55.880]  the way they're doing the testing of pcr the virus isn't the disease hiv is not aids that's why
[3:52:55.880 --> 3:53:04.120]  men can mickey willis he died of azt what are people dying of not sars-cove too they're dying of
[3:53:04.120 --> 3:53:11.800]  isolation the masks transmitting bacterial infections and destroying your glutathione which
[3:53:11.800 --> 3:53:21.240]  is also depleted because of glyphosate toxicity glyphosate is glycine correct and your soil is
[3:53:21.240 --> 3:53:28.680]  depleted of minerals you must have clean amino acids and minerals and and and alex jones is right
[3:53:28.680 --> 3:53:34.520]  we've got to buy it now because they've already told you they're taking anacetyl cysteine they're
[3:53:34.520 --> 3:53:42.920]  taking um they're the glutathione these supplements a supply chain they stop trucks from shipping if
[3:53:42.920 --> 3:53:51.400]  you don't get this now you can't get clean food so they poisoned your food and your animals first
[3:53:51.400 --> 3:53:58.200]  because paximmune the paximmune was going to be used and and actually paximmune the company
[3:53:58.200 --> 3:54:07.400]  paximune um that's used for animals and the fda stop joe cummins this is in our book ending play
[3:54:07.400 --> 3:54:13.800]  from using it to to make animals so when animals express their viruses you eat them
[3:54:14.680 --> 3:54:20.760]  and so then you can get viruses by eating them because glyphosate puts holes in your stomach
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:28.600]  as andy wakefield discovered so did the vaccines that's what andy wakefield saw he's a gastroenterologist
[3:54:28.600 --> 3:54:36.680]  oh you get inflammation you turn the flame on so you see there won't be any other shots if we turn
[3:54:36.680 --> 3:54:45.000]  them off the tv is poison the the the truth sets you free the reason i'm so happy today is i just
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  had a three hour interaction with a practitioner who's seeing the injuries and all we have to do
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:55.560]  is put a little food to it and now i'm sitting here with you and you you know you didn't even
[3:54:55.560 --> 3:55:02.920]  ask me till last night um to and and now now i see the products and now i see the book and i see
[3:55:02.920 --> 3:55:10.440]  the connections and i see how they're trying to divide us they want people not to listen to us
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:17.720]  and if we listen to god and god alone and we love everybody and we put healthy essential
[3:55:17.720 --> 3:55:24.680]  oils and we clean our house not with petroleum products we don't put you know poisonous sunscreen
[3:55:24.680 --> 3:55:31.480]  on we go outside and get an hour a day sun you get the wavelength of 222 which is kryptonite
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:37.640]  that's like 11 in the morning that's visible range you know it's like all of the solutions are there
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:42.920]  and when we all talk to each other we realize wait a minute i worked with all of this and
[3:55:42.920 --> 3:55:51.880]  they were experimenting on the lab workers sit first isero converted to amicron in 2010 i made
[3:55:51.880 --> 3:55:57.880]  an antibody why do you think melinda gate said oh let's get the health care workers the doctors
[3:55:57.880 --> 3:56:05.000]  and nurses because they have to die it's no succomial spread and it's all in the literature
[3:56:05.000 --> 3:56:10.360]  and they've told you all of that and they turned all the literature in the fraud between 2011 when
[3:56:10.360 --> 3:56:18.440]  they jailed me and and 2019 when our second book was going to come out but see they can't do anything
[3:56:18.440 --> 3:56:23.880]  about it they can't do anything about it because the hard drive's been in the fbi's office since
[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:30.520]  may of 2014 and they know we have all the samples i have all the antibodies i have the test i can
[3:56:30.520 --> 3:56:38.840]  prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can get all of these infections and not and not ever
[3:56:38.840 --> 3:56:45.480]  get sick if you just simply do what alex jones says and and some other products that we've now
[3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:51.160]  and technologies even things like hyperbaric oxygen and that we've known from the beginning
[3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:58.200]  folium px which is radiation poisoning and Chernobyl so all the poisons in our environment
[3:56:58.200 --> 3:57:04.760]  something as simple as micron silver not nano silver so it doesn't go in the cells
[3:57:06.040 --> 3:57:10.280]  judy what website we only have about 20 seconds what website can you give people i the reason i
