[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:04.113]  The COVID crisis was the beginning of the collapse of civilization by design.
[00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:14.903]  World IDs, carbon taxes, social credit scores, universal basic income, total neo-fascistic slavery.
[00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:29.053]   Here is the UN head Directing the, quote, social media, that's the panopticonic surveillance system, to censor anyone pointing out that they're overblowing monkeypox.
[00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:29.533]  Here it is.
[00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:35.939]  Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus and can fuel the outbreak.
[00:00:37.443 --> 00:00:44.187]  As we have seen with COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly online.
[00:00:44.947 --> 00:00:55.993]  So we call on all social media platforms, tech companies and news organizations to work with us to prevent and counter harmful information.
[00:00:57.253 --> 00:01:01.257]  They did this 32 months ago when they launched the last major phase of the takeover.
[00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.207]  So when you hear world famine worse than any time in history, Americans worse off at any time since the depression because of COVID.
[00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:14.232]  No, it's because of them launching the fear, them launching the poison shot.
[00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.090]  All of it shows the statistics are they're killing us.
[00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:26.331]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.611]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.611]  [music playing]
[00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.171]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:41.520]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018, most people did nothing to defend Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:49.247]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:53.191]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone.
[00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:56.894]  And without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[00:01:57.815 --> 00:02:03.118]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system.
[00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:07.760]  Brought to you by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.102]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:29.328]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction, Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[00:02:29.868 --> 00:02:38.711]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby.
[00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:42.835]  Who have admitted their intention is to silence Alex Jones.
[00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:55.529]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.131]  But it only gets worse.
[00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:06.495]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor Conspiracy Theory, which is demonstrably false.
[00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:19.361]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:25.243]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:31.444]  And over the course of seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:34.966]  We know this because it's all part of the public record.
[00:03:35.326 --> 00:03:38.547]  But these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:42.328]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:51.015]  They're already, apparently I've heard, that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[00:03:51.175 --> 00:03:53.758]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[00:03:53.838 --> 00:04:00.824]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[00:04:01.144 --> 00:04:03.146]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:08.411]   And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:12.435]  I can't find anyone that produced more discovery than he is, and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:13.116]  Why?
[00:04:13.796 --> 00:04:16.499]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:27.109]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence.
[00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:34.416]  Which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[00:04:34.997 --> 00:04:44.647]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist.
[00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:55.816]   Whatever that mysterious unspecified evidence is, Both judges have stripped Jones of his First Amendment right, but Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[00:04:56.436 --> 00:05:04.061]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working with pedophiles.
[00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:15.868]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda, praising the state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:28.133]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:30.814]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[00:05:31.535 --> 00:05:39.798]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:45.501]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:54.344]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones or InfoWars unfairly.
[00:05:55.245 --> 00:06:02.408]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:11.534]  Alex Jones was cancelled from social media in 2018 and is now being cancelled from the US Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:06:12.334 --> 00:06:15.536]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:22.779]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:26.981]  It relied upon the burden of proof and it was pretty good.
[00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:30.803]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:32.054 --> 00:06:36.935]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Wednesday, July 27, 2022.
[00:06:37.936 --> 00:06:45.798]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from the embattled Infowar Studios in Austin, Texas, transmitting and broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:48.739]  Thank you again for joining us today.
[00:06:49.519 --> 00:06:58.582]  We're living inside the New World Order now, and everything they're doing to us, as I told you four years ago with deplatforming and censorship, is going to be done to you, and now they're announcing it is.
[00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:12.244]  I have ABC News, I have NBC News, I have CNBC, I have Reuters, all saying Jones has been found guilty of defamation and intentional distress and all this other BS.
[00:07:13.406 --> 00:07:15.748]  And now a jury will decide how much he pays.
[00:07:17.193 --> 00:07:27.242]  And they're just shoehorning in this system that they've been using in CPS and the family courts now into all of the courts where all due process is erased.
[00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:38.351]   And that's why they're now running for office CPS lawyers, CPS judges, CPS operatives that have been on the side of taking children For office.
[00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:52.556]  That's who Soros is funding as judges, like the judge here in Austin, Texas, that is no judge at all in my view, but someone will go down the history books as the example of a kangaroo court, of the weaponized judiciary, of a show trial.
[00:07:53.456 --> 00:08:00.298]  And she just sat there yesterday, four times when I saw it, and I was only there half a day, where I was told it was in the news, she said it more and more to the jury.
[00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:01.679]  He's guilty, remember that.
[00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.859]  He's guilty and he's not sorry.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.180]  And he's bad.
[00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.032]  That's like something out of North Korea.
[00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:11.514]  But this is what they're doing.
[00:08:12.235 --> 00:08:13.496]  This is what they're engaged in.
[00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:21.885]  And then she allowed, like, 20 news cameras outside down the hall there on the top floor of the courthouse.
[00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:26.649]  And everybody's out there talking and yelling at me and screaming, you're guilty, Alex Jones, you're going down.
[00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:27.690]  We have video of it all.
[00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:31.935]  But then I walk out during a 20-minute break, and I talk to the press.
[00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:41.399]  And she comes running down the hall, the deputies, and she's just coming to the chambers, and she says, you're not allowed to talk on this floor.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.781]  And on the other floors.
[00:08:44.901 --> 00:08:45.922]  You gotta go to the basement.
[00:08:46.662 --> 00:08:48.863]  And then we went down to the basement, the basement is closed.
[00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:53.806]  Isn't that hilarious, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:08:54.326 --> 00:09:01.211]  And there's some footage of me just calmly talking to the bank of cameras and media that you can't see because they're aimed at me.
[00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.411]  This is the massive thought crime that I engaged in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:06.531 --> 00:09:19.194]  And Chep Smith, with his failed show over at CNBC, comes in and says Jones is already guilty, doesn't mention by a judge, and now will decide how much he owes the families.
[00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:20.274]  And they're saying $150 million.
[00:09:20.314 --> 00:09:20.374]  Wow!
[00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:21.134]  Very, very interesting.
[00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:21.615]  $150 million.
[00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:30.774]   dollars. Wow! Very, very interesting. A hundred and fifty million dollars. If you
[00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:34.614]   go back over six, seven, eight years, that's that's how much money we brought
[00:09:34.614 --> 00:09:38.414]   in from selling products, but that's not how you pay for the man with the crew,
[00:09:38.414 --> 00:09:42.574]  the legal, all the stuff. That money all goes away.
[00:09:40.803 --> 00:09:54.252]  150 million bucks, didn't want it used to be, but they picked that number because now they're going to go next week and describe my net worth, and they have experts that are going to tell you I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:09:55.293 --> 00:10:01.857]  Even though, ladies and gentlemen, if I sold my house and sold everything I've got, I would have a couple million dollars.
[00:10:02.538 --> 00:10:04.339]  But the point is, I don't even care about that.
[00:10:04.719 --> 00:10:09.982]  I care about freedom and justice, and they are wrecking it and they are murdering it right in front of us.
[00:10:10.022 --> 00:10:15.125]  But they're doing it across the board, across not just the U.S., but across the world.
[00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:17.066]  It's the exact same plan.
[00:10:17.347 --> 00:10:21.509]  The judges, the district attorneys, the county attorneys, the U.S.
[00:10:21.549 --> 00:10:44.181]   attorneys, the state attorney generals, The majority of them are now Soros, hardcore leftist, and they know this is their criminal takeover, and they have confidence, and they believe they're going to beat the American people, and they believe they're going to make us all their slaves, and treat us all like poor families, where they take their children away, and basically sell them into the system.
[00:10:45.162 --> 00:10:47.564]  This is nothing but human trafficking writ large, in my view.
[00:10:47.924 --> 00:10:49.205]  That's why the borders are wide open.
[00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:58.758]   They found that Obama, Senate report six years ago, That Obama did traffic tens of thousands of children into sex slavery knowingly?
[00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:03.800]  So that's what this whole thing is about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.081]  And that's where this is all going.
[00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:07.782]  These are very dangerous gangsters.
[00:11:08.422 --> 00:11:14.704]  These are very serious people that have broken the southern border completely and are smuggling millions across every few months.
[00:11:15.345 --> 00:11:17.325]  Hundreds of thousands of children disappearing.
[00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:21.827]  I've witnessed them giving babies to people that aren't their parents with no paperwork at airports.
[00:11:22.087 --> 00:11:23.008]  We've shown you the footage.
[00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:28.429]   I mean, What the South Texas looks like is about to be the whole country.
[00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:38.171]  And they have judges, like this lady, presiding over the takedown, and just the, oh, you don't get jury trials anymore.
[00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:45.593]  You're just guilty because the judge says, and then the jury is told you're guilty, and then how much trouble are you in?
[00:11:47.357 --> 00:11:58.360]  And I've now learned, because I didn't watch much of the jury selection Monday, that a bunch of people, including a lot of minorities and people, were saying, well, I think as a juror, I'm supposed to decide if he's guilty.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.620]  Strzok, you're not on here.
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:07.142]  And remember, she put an order out saying, I am not allowed to talk about the First Amendment or to say I'm innocent.
[00:12:08.622 --> 00:12:12.123]  And my lawyer will be sanctioned if he says I'm innocent.
[00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:18.298]  So you go in, they make you come to court, and then they say you've got to say you're guilty.
[00:12:18.318 --> 00:12:19.318]  Well, I'm not going along with it.
[00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:34.984]  Can't mention the First Amendment, can't say you're innocent, and then yesterday issued a ruling that all the videos where I said, hey, I covered all sides of the sanding hook, I'm sorry, I would hurt your feelings, I think it happened, but some of the anomalies weren't true.
[00:12:35.024 --> 00:12:35.684]  I've been saying that since 2015.
[00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:39.925]  She said, you can't say that.
[00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.487]  Because they've got to rig everything.
[00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:52.873]  Because what they say I did, this campaign of lies, this making money off Sandy Hook, when they're evidence against me, it's 24 minutes of videos.
[00:12:54.194 --> 00:12:57.016]  And I have a right to say those things that I said in the context.
[00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:03.340]  So, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to not really get into that much more this hour.
[00:13:04.758 --> 00:13:05.679]  Robert Barnes is coming in.
[00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:08.001]  We'll get more into it then.
[00:13:09.883 --> 00:13:12.666]  But it really is incredible to watch how they're trying to deceive you.
[00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:16.190]  But you don't tune in to just hear about what's happened to Alex Jones, even though this affects everybody.
[00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.291]  It's a microcosm.
[00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:21.715]  You tune in to get the latest on what's breaking out in the world, and it is insane.
[00:13:22.736 --> 00:13:25.820]  I could spend the next hour on an 11-minute speech Biden put out.
[00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:28.015]  From the White House officially.
[00:13:28.615 --> 00:13:31.096]  People thought it was a deep fake when it first hit Twitter yesterday.
[00:13:31.116 --> 00:13:33.657]  And they went and checked and no, it's on the White House website.
[00:13:34.318 --> 00:13:35.538]  Completely insane.
[00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:38.100]  In 11 minutes, he blinks six times.
[00:13:39.861 --> 00:13:45.323]  I mean, he looks like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese or something.
[00:13:46.624 --> 00:13:52.427]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this looks like the intro to a horror movie or something where body snatchers have taken over.
[00:13:53.427 --> 00:13:56.246]   So, This happens in human civilization.
[00:13:56.306 --> 00:13:58.388]  It normally collapses civilization for at least a time.
[00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:03.615]  When the good people let crazies get in charge, we let them be in control.
[00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:10.023]  And they always start assaulting reality and assaulting common sense and assaulting due process and assaulting logic.
[00:14:10.603 --> 00:14:13.086]  And people keep acquiescing until everything disintegrates.
[00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:16.117]  And that is now the point we've entered at every level.
[00:14:17.078 --> 00:14:19.701]  They've now said that recessions and depressions are actually good for you.
[00:14:20.221 --> 00:14:22.984]  They're now officially saying the school lunch program will be bugs.
[00:14:23.505 --> 00:14:24.666]  It already is in Canada.
[00:14:24.706 --> 00:14:26.488]  The government's rolling out bugs as the new food.
[00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:28.530]  They're banning beef all over Europe.
[00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:30.072]  90 plus percent of the cows.
[00:14:30.812 --> 00:14:32.474]  And it's only going to get worse faster.
[00:14:32.574 --> 00:14:33.615]  This is the big move.
[00:14:34.036 --> 00:14:35.678]  Everything else up until now was beta.
[00:14:36.937 --> 00:14:48.962]  They're making their move now to take your right to self-defense, to take your right to due process, to take your right to not pay for tens of millions of illegals pouring in after the globalists collapsed their countries with two plus years of lockdowns.
[00:14:49.823 --> 00:15:12.877]   But when we come back, the really, really big news that ties together with the accelerated design collapse, the UN has announced, the head of the UN has announced, and the head of the World Health Organization has announced, the puppet of Soros, the puppet of Bill Gates, The UN is directing social media under the global emergency and they have agreements, so you're going to see UN pop-ups again.
[00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:20.540]  Remember what happened during the Pfizer shots causing heart attacks and the doctor said, yeah, this young college student in great shape had a heart attack from it?
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.141]  They said, even though it's true, it's still hurtful.
[00:15:23.161 --> 00:15:24.641]  It may keep others from tagging it.
[00:15:24.701 --> 00:15:26.082]  You're not allowed to be on Facebook.
[00:15:26.482 --> 00:15:27.383]  Your account is banned.
[00:15:28.023 --> 00:15:30.644]  That was a Yahoo announcement from the UN.
[00:15:32.213 --> 00:15:33.654]  So the UN is taking direct control.
[00:15:33.874 --> 00:15:42.581]  They've called for global censorship of all of their opposition today, ahead of the monkeypox and the Marburg virus.
[00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:43.722]  They say it's Ebola-like.
[00:15:44.222 --> 00:15:45.263]  So new lockdowns are coming.
[00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:46.404]  We've got that whole stack here.
[00:15:46.424 --> 00:15:52.108]  The head of the Federal Reserve saying recession's good for you, and just so much more gaslighting.
[00:15:52.488 --> 00:15:56.431]  Oh, and they're officially naming at the federal level breastfeeding man-feeding.
[00:15:57.612 --> 00:16:01.355]  The COVID crisis was the beginning of the collapse of civilization by design.
[00:16:02.967 --> 00:16:12.155]  World ID's, carbon taxes, social credit scores, universal basic income, total neo-fascistic slavery.
[00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:26.367]  Here is the UN head directing the quote social media, that's the panopticonic surveillance system, to censor anyone pointing out that they're overblowing monkey pox.
[00:16:26.387 --> 00:16:26.748]  Here it is.
[00:16:27.367 --> 00:16:33.252]  Stigma and discrimination can be as dangerous as any virus and can fuel the outbreak.
[00:16:34.713 --> 00:16:41.459]  As we have seen with COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation can spread rapidly online.
[00:16:42.239 --> 00:16:53.289]  So we call on all social media platforms, tech companies and news organizations to work with us to prevent and counter harmful information.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.523]  They did this 32 months ago when they launched the last major phase of the takeover.
[00:16:59.503 --> 00:17:07.468]  So when you hear world famine worse than any time in history, Americans worse off than any time since the depression because of COVID.
[00:17:07.528 --> 00:17:11.491]  No, it's because of them launching the fear, them launching the poison shot.
[00:17:12.191 --> 00:17:14.233]  All of it shows the statistics are they're killing us.
[00:17:16.343 --> 00:17:17.403]  So here's the New York Times.
[00:17:17.464 --> 00:17:19.825]  What to know about the Marburg virus disease?
[00:17:19.985 --> 00:17:20.965]  Oh, it's like Ebola.
[00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:24.987]  Look out, it's popped up all over different parts of Asia supposedly.
[00:17:27.408 --> 00:17:28.328]  ABC News.
[00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:33.311]  Ghana declares first ever outbreak of Ebola-like Marburg virus disease.
[00:17:35.432 --> 00:17:37.613]  Now we gotta lock everything down again.
[00:17:38.909 --> 00:17:39.069]  L.A.
[00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:43.071]  County may reinstate mass mandate, but some cities are already pledging to be defiant.
[00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:44.452]  Yes, phase two is coming.
[00:17:44.832 --> 00:17:45.213]  Stop it.
[00:17:45.573 --> 00:17:50.996]  Member of European Parliament labels COVID vaccine coercion, worst crime ever committed in humanity.
[00:17:52.777 --> 00:18:00.161]  Deaths from unknown causes are now the leading killer in Alberta, Canada, following the rollout of the experimental vaccine.
[00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:02.322]  Similar numbers all over the world.
[00:18:04.946 --> 00:18:05.847]  Coming up, we'll play the clip.
[00:18:05.867 --> 00:18:12.230]  Tucker Carlson points out with Mainline Studies that women are having record-level menstrual problems.
[00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.792]  In fact, women in the UK are missing two-thirds of their periods suddenly.
[00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:18.013]  Yep.
[00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:19.954]  Not gonna be having babies ever again.
[00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:24.056]  Workers lost $3.7 trillion in earnings during the pandemic.
[00:18:24.497 --> 00:18:26.298]  Women in Gen Z saw the biggest losses.
[00:18:27.058 --> 00:18:28.019]  But it wasn't a pandemic.
[00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:28.939]  It was a shutdown.
[00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:30.340]  Destroy the infrastructure.
[00:18:32.916 --> 00:18:37.916]   officials warn of brain swelling, vision loss in minors using puberty blockers,
[00:18:37.916 --> 00:18:43.596]   but it's okay. Billionaires made 3.3 trillion during the pandemic, enough to
[00:18:43.596 --> 00:18:49.955]   pay for everyone's vaccine, and it goes on and on from there. Researchers hack
[00:18:49.955 --> 00:18:57.876]   fly brains and control them remotely. What do you think they're doing to us? This
[00:18:57.876 --> 00:19:02.476]   powerful report, all these top scientists confirming nanotech in the Pfizer-Moderna
[00:19:02.476 --> 00:19:10.275]   shots, that's coming up as I mentioned a little bit later in the transmission.
[00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:12.055]  But first I wanted to move into this.
[00:19:12.075 --> 00:19:23.740]  Remember I said two years ago, two years ago, that if the economic collapse continued with lockdowns, you'd have worldwide starvation, the worst you've ever seen, and cannibalism in all major studies would explode.
[00:19:24.718 --> 00:19:25.578]  Look at these headlines.
[00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:28.299]  Biden Economic Advisor Claims U.S.
[00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:31.660]  Is Far Better Than Any Other Countries Where There's Famine.
[00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:32.841]  Wow!
[00:19:33.621 --> 00:19:42.104]  Inflation Hits New York City With Bacon, Egg, And Cheese Exploding In Prices.
[00:19:43.405 --> 00:19:45.765]  And the New York Times Says Cannibalism Is A Good Thing.
[00:19:46.045 --> 00:19:47.626]  Has Been Part Of A Good Thing In History.
[00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.687]  That We Should Embrace Cannibalism.
[00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:52.333]  They say cannibalism has a time and place.
[00:19:52.353 --> 00:19:53.914]  This is a special New York Times.
[00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:57.236]  Some recent books, films, and shows suggest that the time is now.
[00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:58.537]  Can you stomach it?
[00:19:59.403 --> 00:20:03.885]  They say for the carbon footprint to be lowered when you start eating the bodies of the dead.
[00:20:04.825 --> 00:20:05.885]  All dehumanizing you.
[00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:08.366]  All training you to accept any type of evil.
[00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.207]  Hey, you don't get a jury trial.
[00:20:10.567 --> 00:20:11.988]  You're just found guilty by a judge.
[00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:15.549]  Hey, you get checked by the TSA, but illegal aliens don't.
[00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:21.031]  Hey, just get used to all the checks and balances, all the protections being thrown out.
[00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:23.892]  Here's the New York Times, a taste for cannibalism.
[00:20:27.628 --> 00:20:30.510]  Increasingly desperate, Alex Jones says he will kill and eat his neighbors.
[00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:40.197]  And I said, this is satire, a modest proposal, famous, most famous piece of satire ever.
[00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:41.438]  But I said, I'm serious.
[00:20:41.938 --> 00:20:42.859]  This is where the world's going.
[00:20:42.879 --> 00:20:44.600]  This continues and they're going to push cannibalism.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.101]  Predicted it all.
[00:20:47.082 --> 00:20:47.362]  Remember?
[00:20:47.402 --> 00:20:47.902]  Two years ago.
[00:20:49.383 --> 00:20:50.784]  Two years ago.
[00:20:51.264 --> 00:20:51.665]  Here it is.
[00:20:52.987 --> 00:20:56.088]  Canada's snack food is now made with crickets as primary ingredient.
[00:20:56.848 --> 00:20:58.568]  And they're rolling them out in the school lunch programs.
[00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:00.448]  You will eat the bugs.
[00:21:01.008 --> 00:21:04.089]  And FEMA says, get prepared now, there may not be enough food soon.
[00:21:04.349 --> 00:21:05.369]  But we're kooks and bad.
[00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:08.890]  We sell the highest quality, terrible food at the lowest prices at preparetoday.com.
[00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.131]  And it gets more insane.
[00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.171]  Yellen, recession doesn't mean what you think it means.
[00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:18.151]  It's now a good thing.
[00:21:18.532 --> 00:21:20.732]  Big Zero Hedge article on that.
[00:21:23.444 --> 00:21:25.125]  And they continue to gaslight everybody.
[00:21:25.225 --> 00:21:29.826]  AP instructs news media to avoid certain words when referring to transgender issues.
[00:21:30.206 --> 00:21:33.367]  And the encyclopedias are all changing the terms now to get rid of man and woman.
[00:21:34.808 --> 00:21:35.608]  That ties into this.
[00:21:35.628 --> 00:21:36.368]  You think I'm joking?
[00:21:37.148 --> 00:21:42.930]  The federal government has now come out with guidelines a few months ago calling it chest feeding.
[00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:43.630]  That's not enough.
[00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.912]  Now the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine advocating hospitals use the term father's milk.
[00:21:51.124 --> 00:21:51.925]  You're like, that's insane.
[00:21:52.405 --> 00:21:55.527]  It's about getting you trained to accept total and complete insanity.
[00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:58.509]  Combination of videos on Infowars.com.
[00:21:58.889 --> 00:22:00.911]  Biden's Energy Secretary has a new statement out.
[00:22:01.251 --> 00:22:05.974]  Admits being obsessed with green transition, and that's why they're cutting our power off.
[00:22:07.595 --> 00:22:10.657]  See how that all works.
[00:22:11.938 --> 00:22:15.181]  See how the new world order operates.
[00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:23.722]   But the good news is, Humanity is waking up very, very fast.
[00:22:24.565 --> 00:22:26.812]  It's number one on seven of the charts.
[00:22:27.782 --> 00:22:33.026]  It's now number 52, as of last time I checked an hour ago, of books in the world.
[00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:33.927]  It goes to number one.
[00:22:33.947 --> 00:22:35.087]  It'll be the number one book in the world.
[00:22:35.488 --> 00:22:38.310]  It doesn't come out until late August, but it's being printed as we speak.
[00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.032]  It'll be shipping out in late August.
[00:22:41.392 --> 00:22:43.754]  I don't normally support Amazon, but we almost hit it to number one.
[00:22:43.774 --> 00:22:46.776]  And again, I will get some of that funding.
[00:22:46.816 --> 00:22:48.337]  It'll be dumped right into InfoWars.
[00:22:48.357 --> 00:22:51.159]  We're also selling the book and sign copies at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:51.179 --> 00:23:02.657]   But the big issue is, Yuval Harari, the high priest of the World Health Organization, gives his book away on Amazon as part of a grant, telling you humans are over, the new world order is taking over.
[00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:06.520]  He's been number two on average.
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:13.884]  We're now number one in media studies, in history, in all of these other key charts.
[00:23:14.625 --> 00:23:16.906]  Let me show you some of those charts here that I've printed off.
[00:23:18.747 --> 00:23:21.349]  So you can see this here for yourself.
[00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:30.185]  Again, this is Amazon bestsellers, number one in history, ahead of Sapiens, his book he gives away.
[00:23:30.205 --> 00:23:33.527]  Of course, nothing's for free.
[00:23:33.547 --> 00:23:35.249]  They're teaching you their new religion.
[00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:38.691]  Just like Christians will hand out Bibles, they hand out their Bibles.
[00:23:39.292 --> 00:23:40.593]  You want to know the whole enemy battle plan?
[00:23:42.423 --> 00:23:55.793]  Go to infowarestore.com and get a copy there if you really want to support us as we get half the money of each sale there, or we get a couple bucks from each sale on Amazon, but I want to send them both to number one, and so please go to Amazon and get The Great Reset today.
[00:23:55.833 --> 00:23:58.115]  It's really freaking them out.
[00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:04.459]  It's going to go to number one unless they pull it, and if they do that, it'll just even blow up their face more.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:10.004]  Alex's War is still number two on the Apple charts for pre-order.
[00:24:10.164 --> 00:24:11.505]  It drops.
[00:24:13.198 --> 00:24:13.758]  On Friday.
[00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:20.521]  I did not make the film, and it shows me in a good light, a bad light, a real light, but it is powerful and exposes the New World Order.
[00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:34.826]  That is just a mirror of the people and how awake they are, and how folks understand that the main enemy is the New World Order, and if you want the blueprint of how they're attacking you, their playbook, and how to stop them, you need the Great Reset and the War for the World by yours truly.
[00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:35.827]  Alex Jones.
[00:24:35.847 --> 00:24:38.708]  Steve Bannon called it the most important book since the Founding Fathers.
[00:24:38.728 --> 00:24:39.208]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:41.726]  There's been a number of studies.
[00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:47.809]  The New York Times just did one about menstruating cycles and how that is affected by vaccines.
[00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.550]  Yeah.
[00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:57.373]  Well, the menstrual thing is something that seems to be quite transient and temporary.
[00:24:57.573 --> 00:24:58.294]  That's the point.
[00:24:58.314 --> 00:24:59.094]  That's one of the points.
[00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:00.635]  We need to study it more.
[00:25:01.926 --> 00:25:02.947]  Oh, we need to study it more.
[00:25:03.788 --> 00:25:04.989]  We need to study it more.
[00:25:05.009 --> 00:25:11.694]  It's just like human fertility, reproducing the species, the most important event in most people's lives.
[00:25:12.235 --> 00:25:13.176]  We need to study it more.
[00:25:13.356 --> 00:25:14.056]  Oh, but it's too late.
[00:25:15.097 --> 00:25:19.521]  We just forced millions of women to take that drug.
[00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:20.402]  Sorry!
[00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:29.770]  So how did they release a vaccine and then make it mandatory when they didn't understand the long-term effects of the drug?
[00:25:30.865 --> 00:25:32.426]  That's a very good question.
[00:25:33.227 --> 00:25:34.208]  Here's Deborah Birx.
[00:25:34.648 --> 00:25:37.971]  She's the former White House COVID response director, again on Fox News.
[00:25:39.312 --> 00:25:50.642]  I knew these vaccines were not gonna protect against infection, and I think we overplayed the vaccines, and it made people then worry that it's not gonna protect against severe disease and hospitalization.
[00:25:50.782 --> 00:25:52.684]  It will, but let's be very clear.
[00:25:52.704 --> 00:25:58.189]  50% of the people who died from the Omicron surge were older, vaccinated.
[00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:00.891]  What?!
[00:26:02.212 --> 00:26:07.816]  Quote, I knew these vaccines were not going to protect against infection.
[00:26:07.916 --> 00:26:09.016]  Really, Deborah Birx?
[00:26:09.557 --> 00:26:16.921]  But somehow you forgot to mention that as people were being fired from their jobs for not taking this on the premise that if they took it, they would never be infected?
[00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:18.782]  When do you get criminally charged?
[00:26:19.042 --> 00:26:19.523]  Soon, we hope.
[00:26:20.816 --> 00:26:24.879]  And then there's the effect of the COVID vaccines on the elderly, the population most at risk.
[00:26:25.459 --> 00:26:37.628]  According to the Lancet, no less than, vaccinated people around Joe Biden's age are 80% more likely to become sick after taking the COVID shot as compared to unvaccinated people.
[00:26:37.688 --> 00:26:38.409]  Wait, what?
[00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.733]  80% more likely to become sick after taking the shot that was supposed to prevent them from getting sick?
[00:26:44.713 --> 00:26:46.835]  How is this not the banner headline?
[00:26:47.615 --> 00:26:48.236]  It's being ignored.
[00:26:50.882 --> 00:26:54.023]  You don't even need to put two plus two together to understand.
[00:26:54.063 --> 00:26:56.703]  We told you it would attack the menstrual cycle.
[00:26:56.743 --> 00:26:58.664]  We told you it attacked the ovaries.
[00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:03.305]  The top scientist that headed up Pfizer, who just retired a year before they launched this, said that.
[00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:05.305]  They've done rat studies secretly.
[00:27:05.585 --> 00:27:06.285]  That's all come out.
[00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:08.906]  They did this on purpose.
[00:27:10.126 --> 00:27:14.327]  And it has nanotech in it that starts reproducing in the body.
[00:27:15.347 --> 00:27:16.227]  You can't make that up.
[00:27:16.307 --> 00:27:25.495]   This, when I say an alien takeover, The globalists believe they're becoming a new species and are going to use us as the guinea pigs for it, and that they're building a new species here on the planet.
[00:27:26.435 --> 00:27:35.699]  And you can pull up hundreds of headlines, scientists create new life forms on space station, scientists create new life forms in mineshaft, scientists create new chimeric creatures.
[00:27:37.419 --> 00:27:39.600]  That's what they're doing, and then we try to have a discussion about it.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:46.327]   They say, shut up, nothing's happening, or get used to it, it's a wonderful Transition we're all in.
[00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:47.027]  Look at this.
[00:27:48.168 --> 00:28:06.899]  So many top scientists in Spain, in Germany, in New Zealand, in England, this is just a shorter version of ours I've seen, have looked at this with electron microscopes and it's on record and then you see the ingredients patented to grow a graphite oxide nano matrix in the body.
[00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:10.501]  These things replicate out of what's in your tissue.
[00:28:11.622 --> 00:28:13.463]  They grow in you, they colonize you.
[00:28:15.911 --> 00:28:17.932]  And it turns out Gates had all these patents to do it.
[00:28:18.872 --> 00:28:23.113]  They've just attacked us, and people can't admit the horror they're under.
[00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:29.314]  Twice you see national news going, Alex Jones found guilty, now a jury decides how much money he pays.
[00:28:30.154 --> 00:28:32.375]  They just slip that in, like, oh, the end of juries.
[00:28:32.835 --> 00:28:33.655]  Decide if you're guilty.
[00:28:34.675 --> 00:28:35.276]  Same thing here.
[00:28:35.716 --> 00:28:37.696]  The end of the FDA doing testing.
[00:28:38.436 --> 00:28:41.217]  In fact, after this clip, cue up the Fauci clip again from the 1980s.
[00:28:41.237 --> 00:28:45.178]  Saying, oh, we couldn't approve this vaccine, we'd kill a bunch of people.
[00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:49.087]  But now he says we don't need any studies.
[00:28:49.908 --> 00:28:52.031]  But they've already done the secret studies.
[00:28:53.272 --> 00:28:59.560]  But first, let's go to this little compilation of scientists, prestigious scientists, documenting what's in these poison shots.
[00:29:01.692 --> 00:29:30.531]  We were contacted early in the week by a group of scientists who've been doing some scientific analysis and microscopy work on the Pfizer vaccine, which had been stimulated by some overseas reports by groups of very credible and credentialed experts, chemists and pathologists, who were reporting finding what appears to be very, very, very, very tiny, but very complex sort of nanoscale technology.
[00:29:32.012 --> 00:29:35.776]  And the group in New Zealand have found exactly the same thing.
[00:29:36.377 --> 00:29:49.031]  So I was asked to go and have a look and I have certainly satisfied myself that these are not fakes and that these are real people and this is real work having been done in New Zealand.
[00:29:49.608 --> 00:29:51.569]  Have you ever come across anything like this before?
[00:29:51.829 --> 00:29:55.190]  Well, we've been aware of reports that I mentioned.
[00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.550]  From the IBCs?
[00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:57.050]  Yes.
[00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:06.253]  So there's a Spanish group, so Orwell.city is the website, and they've been publishing work steadily.
[00:30:07.593 --> 00:30:20.903]   And there's a group in Germany, very eminent pathologists, Who reported their findings on post-mortems of people who died post-vaccination, and they reported seeing things that they'd never seen before in their very long careers.
[00:30:21.083 --> 00:30:26.609]  They also reported finding unexpected ingredients, shall I say, in the vaccines.
[00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:30.292]  In fact, there were a number of other scientists and health professionals on that.
[00:30:30.853 --> 00:30:33.573]  press conference also reported the same thing.
[00:30:33.573 --> 00:30:37.731]   So, you know, it's still very shocking when you see it yourself.
[00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:41.173]   You know, it's important to remember when you're looking at the pictures and the videos
[00:30:41.173 --> 00:30:45.893]   that, you know, this is nano-scale, which means, you know, extremely small.
[00:30:45.893 --> 00:30:52.052]   And some of the sort of the behavior of what seems to be machinery or circuitry,
[00:30:52.052 --> 00:30:56.052]   router's chips, that type of thing, you know, is very hard to explain.
[00:30:56.052 --> 00:31:00.773]   But scientists tell me that at that sort of scale, things like gravity and magnetism,
[00:31:00.773 --> 00:31:01.731]  behave rather differently.
[00:31:01.731 --> 00:31:04.373]  And I certainly am no expert at all in this area.
[00:31:04.373 --> 00:31:09.493]  But having spent a very hurried few days really trying to...
[00:31:09.625 --> 00:31:17.933]  You just heard on Tucker Carlson, the former head of these programs, saying, oh, we knew it wouldn't help you, but we still went ahead and did it.
[00:31:17.752 --> 00:31:19.752]  investigators who are charged with protecting the public.
[00:31:19.752 --> 00:31:25.511]   You just heard on Tucker Carlson, the former head of these programs, saying,
[00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:28.072]   "Oh, we knew it wouldn't help you, but we still went ahead and did it."
[00:31:28.072 --> 00:31:30.072]  Oh, it'll help you, all right.
[00:31:30.072 --> 00:31:32.072]  And these colonies are only one part of this.
[00:31:32.233 --> 00:31:38.117]  It also makes your body grow the poisonous, cancer-causing, sterilizing, spike protein.
[00:31:38.878 --> 00:31:43.442]  Here's Fauci explaining why you have to have testing of vaccines.
[00:31:43.462 --> 00:31:44.442]  Those were traditional vaccines.
[00:31:44.462 --> 00:31:45.984]  With these, it's a thousand times worse.
[00:31:46.244 --> 00:31:46.684]  Here he is.
[00:31:47.085 --> 00:31:54.811]  Many scientists are beginning to believe that a vaccine against AIDS may be impossible to make and too dangerous to test.
[00:31:55.782 --> 00:31:59.884]  If you take it and then a year goes by and everybody's fine.
[00:32:00.384 --> 00:32:01.644]  Then you say, okay, that's good.
[00:32:01.684 --> 00:32:04.065]  Now let's give it to 500 people.
[00:32:04.105 --> 00:32:06.066]  And then a year goes by and everything's fine.
[00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:08.447]  Say, well, now let's give it to thousands of people.
[00:32:08.807 --> 00:32:13.830]  And then you find out that it takes 12 years for all hell to break loose.
[00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.030]  And then what have you done?
[00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:17.531]  What have you done?
[00:32:17.551 --> 00:32:23.334]  Oh, but the head of the UN says, don't question the new rollout, the new lockdowns, the new fear.
[00:32:24.673 --> 00:32:32.420]  Here is a German member of the EU Parliament, Christina Anderson, saying the vaccine campaign will go down as the biggest scandal in medical history.
[00:32:33.241 --> 00:32:49.657]  This vaccine campaign, it will go down as the biggest scandal in medical history, and moreover, it will be known as the biggest crime ever committed on humanity.
[00:32:52.648 --> 00:32:56.471]  Oh yeah, mass sterilization, mass death, record numbers of young people dying.
[00:32:57.432 --> 00:33:00.855]  All the insurance company numbers are coming in, the actuaries.
[00:33:01.516 --> 00:33:02.156]  They really did it.
[00:33:03.337 --> 00:33:13.165]  And so it's not isolated that they're getting rid of all of our freedoms and cutting off our infrastructure and our food and getting rid of our borders and defunding the police and putting Soros criminals in every position of power.
[00:33:13.666 --> 00:33:15.467]  This is just the beginning.
[00:33:17.349 --> 00:33:19.110]  Until we really wake up that we're under attack.
[00:33:20.697 --> 00:33:33.564]  Half the population roughly took the poison shots and folks are so trained to never admit they're wrong under the mass hypnosis Stockholm paradigm that they will continue to defend it even as they mutate and even as they die.
[00:33:34.025 --> 00:33:49.314]  But the globalists believe some will mutate and become this new creature, this super sapien, but most of us will die in the process as we're just randomly injected with super high-tech, super science replication systems that take over every damn cell in our body.
[00:33:50.143 --> 00:33:50.823]  It's here, folks.
[00:33:51.464 --> 00:33:52.064]  It's going down.
[00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:57.347]  Most people just get sick and have blood clots and slowly die, but others, a lot of weird stuff's happening to them.
[00:33:58.127 --> 00:33:59.768]  And of course, it sterilizes you as well.
[00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:00.548]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:01.529 --> 00:34:09.392]  Again, the whole 11-minute videos on Infowars.com, people thought it was fake till they went to the White House website.
[00:34:09.412 --> 00:34:19.997]   11 minutes plus of Biden looking like he's a robot, blinking his eyes six times, In the speech.
[00:34:21.499 --> 00:34:23.501]  Totally psychotic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:24.843 --> 00:34:28.768]  Must be on unbelievable amounts of amphetamine, reportedly they're injecting him with.
[00:34:29.709 --> 00:34:31.090]  Very, very dangerous.
[00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:32.132]  Let's play a few clips of it.
[00:34:33.817 --> 00:34:36.180]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-cop.
[00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:39.004]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.
[00:34:39.304 --> 00:34:41.867]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-American.
[00:34:42.228 --> 00:34:44.370]  Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.
[00:34:45.111 --> 00:34:50.338]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[00:34:50.979 --> 00:34:56.182]   Folks, as we fight inflation, Bringing down gas prices is a big part of the job.
[00:34:56.862 --> 00:34:57.642]  And here's the good news.
[00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:00.743]  Gas prices have dropped every day this summer.
[00:35:01.663 --> 00:35:03.564]  That's more than 40 days in a row.
[00:35:04.104 --> 00:35:14.266]  We now have 40,000 gas stations in the United States where the price of gas is... Alright, I wanted to play some of the 11-minute speech so you can see he's not blinking and then another speech later where he is.
[00:35:14.346 --> 00:35:17.347]  I mean, if you can figure out what this is, please tell me.
[00:35:17.807 --> 00:35:26.299]   We've reached out to some physiologists and people that can perhaps Tell us what in the world this means, but it's getting crazy.
[00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:29.320]  And there's a bunch of videos of Kamala Harris making no sense, too.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.680]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[00:35:31.661 --> 00:35:36.442]  And that's who the Globe was to put in as their puppet, so they'll get the blame and not the New World Order.
[00:35:36.482 --> 00:35:38.123]  They've got all their damn masks back on.
[00:35:38.143 --> 00:35:40.384]  You know, they've all had four or five shots.
[00:35:40.484 --> 00:35:41.704]  It's just insane.
[00:35:42.604 --> 00:35:45.145]  Now, Robert Barnes is about to come up.
[00:35:46.165 --> 00:35:47.686]  I'm going to be dealing with the trial stuff.
[00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:56.759]   One of three rigged trials all being run by The Obama administration, they have FBI people, everybody involved.
[00:35:56.839 --> 00:35:57.920]  It's just unspeakable.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.643]  But I wanted to just illustrate something here before I hit some of this news, dealing with this.
[00:36:04.584 --> 00:36:05.865]  And that's just a few minutes of it.
[00:36:05.885 --> 00:36:06.665]  It's a long report.
[00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:10.728]  I'm not going to play it all, but look at how the CNBC Shepard Smith's report starts.
[00:36:11.208 --> 00:36:14.270]  He's already been found guilty, and they don't tell you how, by a judge.
[00:36:16.047 --> 00:36:22.331]  And now a jury's going to decide how much the guilty man that did intentionally hurt these people, but I never said their names.
[00:36:25.573 --> 00:36:25.833]  Again.
[00:36:27.674 --> 00:36:28.834]  Al Capone got a trial.
[00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:30.475]  Charlie Manson got a trial.
[00:36:30.796 --> 00:36:31.676]  Jeffrey Dahmer got a trial.
[00:36:31.716 --> 00:36:32.236]  And remember this.
[00:36:33.517 --> 00:36:38.580]  My fake show trial is all over everywhere.
[00:36:40.221 --> 00:36:41.021]  On every jam channel.
[00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:43.563]  Because they hate populist.
[00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.199]  If they can demonize Alex Jones, they can beat you.
[00:36:48.259 --> 00:36:53.861]  But the Ghislaine Maxwell government child molesting Jeffrey Epstein operation, it wasn't televised, it was highly censored.
[00:36:54.101 --> 00:36:58.843]  Because they were protecting themselves and how they use sex trafficking of children to protect themselves.
[00:37:00.183 --> 00:37:17.295]   And everywhere you swing a stick, you run into one of these people connected to children and taking children away and this whole New World Order operation, it's the very Essence of what they're after is our innocence and our children with their transgenderism and their poison shots and all of it.
[00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:19.195]  It is a crime against humanity.
[00:37:19.215 --> 00:37:22.236]  We've got to just take the blinders off and admit what we're up against.
[00:37:22.275 --> 00:37:34.435]   So the Jeffrey Epstein, Gisling Maxwell trial wasn't on TV, but the CPS operative who wrote the Texas handbook
[00:37:34.435 --> 00:37:42.114]   on taking children away and how parents don't have rights, she's my special Soros judge.
[00:37:42.114 --> 00:37:44.435]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:37:44.435 --> 00:37:48.735]   And a lot of people are digging into her right now and they're finding some really nightmarish stuff.
[00:37:48.735 --> 00:37:56.394]   Well, let me tell you, she was looking at me yesterday with just enjoyment and hate.
[00:37:56.027 --> 00:38:06.131]  Janet Reno looked as evil in person and I've been around Hillary Clinton in person and seen them from like 20, 30 feet away when they gave speeches and they don't look like, they look like demons.
[00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:08.271]  And I'm just being honest.
[00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:12.573]  And that's what I saw in that courtroom was almost the whole group against me.
[00:38:12.873 --> 00:38:15.134]  I looked over and they look like Biden, like robots.
[00:38:15.862 --> 00:38:17.983]  And they were just giving me these weird demonic smiles.
[00:38:18.403 --> 00:38:20.525]  These people are turned over to evil, folks.
[00:38:20.865 --> 00:38:22.546]  This is truly the rise of hell.
[00:38:23.246 --> 00:38:23.766]  Unbelievable.
[00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:25.867]  Absolute tyrants.
[00:38:26.488 --> 00:38:29.769]  Here is Shep Smith trying to pull a fast one and shoehorn in.
[00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.871]  A judge saying you're guilty.
[00:38:31.911 --> 00:38:32.271]  Here it is.
[00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.490]  Alex Jones.
[00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:41.015]  They already found him guilty of defaming Sandy Hook families by claiming that that massacre was a hoax with crisis actors.
[00:38:41.635 --> 00:38:47.759]  Today, testimony in the civil trial began to decide how much he owes them for his words and actions.
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:53.983]  Neal Helsen and Scarlett Lewis' six-year-old son died in the school massacre.
[00:38:54.003 --> 00:38:54.644]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:38:54.664 --> 00:38:54.924]  That's enough.
[00:38:57.944 --> 00:38:58.764]  Well what a fast one.
[00:38:59.064 --> 00:39:10.328]  Oh, he was found guilty, implying I'm a criminal, that was a judge in a civil trial, found me guilty, in both the trial she's having and the one in Connecticut, exact same attack profile.
[00:39:11.628 --> 00:39:15.029]  He's been found guilty and now in the civil trial they'll decide.
[00:39:15.049 --> 00:39:15.170]  What?
[00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.970]  That's not even how the law works.
[00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.911]  But none of it works that way.
[00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:21.612]  I've got mainline, major U.S.
[00:39:21.652 --> 00:39:26.335]   institutions saying It is now man breastfeeding.
[00:39:26.755 --> 00:39:27.695]  Men breastfeed.
[00:39:27.775 --> 00:39:31.696]  I mean, it's just a total, absolute attack on civilization.
[00:39:32.677 --> 00:39:33.857]  Here's just some of the tweets about it.
[00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:38.718]  Alex Jones faces jury trial over Sandy Hook, says Reuters.
[00:39:39.619 --> 00:39:41.439]  But I don't face it over Sandy Hook.
[00:39:41.479 --> 00:39:43.540]  They're deciding how guilty I am because I've already been...
[00:39:45.219 --> 00:39:45.859]  Said that I'm guilty.
[00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:53.643]  Mike Cernovich read the Yahoo News article that basically admitted all this but said it was good and said, this is the most rigged case I've ever read about in all of U.S.
[00:39:53.683 --> 00:39:54.023]  history.
[00:39:54.723 --> 00:39:55.564]  Because it really is.
[00:39:56.104 --> 00:39:56.804]  That's where we are.
[00:39:57.084 --> 00:39:57.665]  And he's a lawyer.
[00:39:59.526 --> 00:40:03.507]  Judge admonishes Alex Jones for speaking outside courtroom on the first day of the Sandy Hook Affirmation Trial.
[00:40:03.788 --> 00:40:05.208]  She told the media to set up up there.
[00:40:05.468 --> 00:40:07.449]  They're out there screaming at me when I walk in.
[00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:09.150]  You're getting it!
[00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.970]  You're guilty!
[00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.831]  We're gonna ruin you!
[00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:16.676]  But I walk out and talk to the press and she goes, you don't talk when you're on this floor.
[00:40:16.776 --> 00:40:17.277]  That's a quote.
[00:40:19.618 --> 00:40:21.520]  You can talk to people in the basement, which is closed.
[00:40:23.223 --> 00:40:27.465]  Sandy Hook parents are cashing in, is what Fun Times on Twitter says.
[00:40:27.946 --> 00:40:31.147]  A million dollar industry, they are out there every week making money.
[00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:33.188]  Somebody needs to write a story about their industry.
[00:40:33.669 --> 00:40:36.810]  I never said Heslin or Lewis's names.
[00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.572]  They were married back when their son was tragically killed.
[00:40:39.852 --> 00:40:40.573]  Never said their names.
[00:40:40.713 --> 00:40:41.053]  Never did.
[00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:45.015]  But they sat up there and said, for 10 years I persecuted them and destroyed their lives.
[00:40:49.577 --> 00:40:50.138]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:51.397 --> 00:41:06.020]  And we're not supposed to, I guess, talk about, the judges said that that man and woman just won a seventy-two, the insurance companies caved in, seventy-three, excuse me, million dollar lawsuit that bankrupted Remington.
[00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:07.581]  It's the same group.
[00:41:10.221 --> 00:41:11.622]  The same organization.
[00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:13.142]  Seventy-three million.
[00:41:13.182 --> 00:41:13.822]  That's not enough.
[00:41:14.182 --> 00:41:15.803]  They won a hundred and fifty million from me.
[00:41:16.223 --> 00:41:17.223]  Good luck.
[00:41:18.995 --> 00:41:21.277]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:23.058 --> 00:41:24.799]  And they love the attention.
[00:41:25.039 --> 00:41:28.421]  The judge and the media and the lawyers and all of it.
[00:41:29.302 --> 00:41:36.346]  And the Sandy Hook families that have sued are all over the news constantly saying that I got famous off Sandy Hook when I barely ever even talked about it.
[00:41:36.366 --> 00:41:37.387]  It was a big controversy.
[00:41:37.907 --> 00:41:39.788]  People didn't believe it because the government's so unbelievable.
[00:41:40.409 --> 00:41:46.633]  And then they say that I had a secret plan to get rich off of it when I tried to settle with them with every dime of cash we had.
[00:41:48.379 --> 00:41:50.600]  Months ago, and said, look, I don't want to have a show trial.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.580]  I know what you're doing.
[00:41:52.481 --> 00:41:57.863]  I said, if you really, you know, just want everything I got, here it is.
[00:41:58.563 --> 00:42:00.884]  But now there's nothing to settle with in the future because there is nothing.
[00:42:01.545 --> 00:42:03.185]  And we'll just stay on air one way or the other.
[00:42:03.526 --> 00:42:04.666]  Thanks to our listeners and supporters.
[00:42:04.706 --> 00:42:09.148]  That's who I wanted to thank is all of you that have stood with us.
[00:42:09.808 --> 00:42:17.436]   We're going to have to raise more money and they're going to do their show trials and have their I mean, I would imagine, hell, the next verdict might be a billion dollars.
[00:42:17.456 --> 00:42:18.176]  Make it ten billion.
[00:42:19.397 --> 00:42:20.677]  I've already been told I'm guilty.
[00:42:20.757 --> 00:42:21.878]  The judge tells him he's guilty.
[00:42:21.918 --> 00:42:22.858]  He's guilty right in front of me.
[00:42:22.878 --> 00:42:23.759]  This man is guilty.
[00:42:23.779 --> 00:42:24.419]  Do you understand that?
[00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:25.580]  No judge ever did that.
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.440]  How about prejudicing a jury?
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.721]  She's got people on the hall screaming at me.
[00:42:30.682 --> 00:42:31.522]  Oh, they're good.
[00:42:32.322 --> 00:42:33.383]  They're hanging out with the plaintiffs.
[00:42:35.785 --> 00:42:48.634]  And so, as long as we have the funds, folks, we are going to appeal and we're going to battle for years in the courts while the whole New World Order takes over and our credibility shoots to the top and we either defeat the New World Order or we all go down with the ship.
[00:42:49.515 --> 00:42:50.035]  That's where we're at.
[00:42:51.356 --> 00:42:54.038]  And so, the funds is what we need.
[00:42:54.058 --> 00:43:06.605]   That's why they want a $150 million judgment because then you've got to get, depending on how it works, 10, 20, 30% of the bail, we won't be able to get that and they want to then send a receiver in to turn the
[00:43:06.605 --> 00:43:07.014]  lights out.
[00:43:07.014 --> 00:43:08.014]  They admit that.
[00:43:08.014 --> 00:43:10.535]  They said, "Our goal is to silence him and shut him down."
[00:43:10.535 --> 00:43:12.014]  But we got other folks out there.
[00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:15.775]   As long as it's not my studio or my money, we'll be able to operate somewhere else, but
[00:43:15.775 --> 00:43:17.375]  it'll be very disruptive.
[00:43:17.375 --> 00:43:19.054]  I want to fight through this.
[00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:20.615]  We'll be able to do the appeals.
[00:43:20.615 --> 00:43:22.735]  We'll be able to move forward, but we need funds.
[00:43:22.735 --> 00:43:26.535]   So thank you for going to InfowarsTore.com, getting an Alex Jones is Right T-shirt, for
[00:43:26.535 --> 00:43:29.935]   ordering a signed or unsigned copy of the new book, The War for the World, The Great

[00:43:45.214 --> 00:43:49.398]  Unfortunately, we've already sold out like 10% of what we had come in just yesterday.
[00:43:49.438 --> 00:43:51.741]  So that brought in a lot of funds, but we got goals we got to meet.
[00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:54.043]  So get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion while you still can.
[00:43:54.103 --> 00:43:57.947]  All the vitamins, all the minerals, all the amino acids in one place.

[00:44:10.468 --> 00:44:11.289]  We're fighting for you.
[00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:12.169]  We're in this together.
[00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:16.492]  As Benjamin Franklin said, we're all going to hang together or hang separate.
[00:44:16.512 --> 00:44:17.713]  And we are hanging together.
[00:44:17.773 --> 00:44:19.835]  And we're going to beat the New World Order with God's help.
[00:44:20.075 --> 00:44:21.136]  So pray for the Global Awakening.
[00:44:21.176 --> 00:44:22.096]  Pray for M4s.
[00:44:22.576 --> 00:44:24.098]  And pray for these tyrants to be exposed.
[00:44:24.378 --> 00:44:27.260]  We'll be right back in the next hour with a critical report by Greg Reese.
[00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:39.460]  and then Robert Barnes.
[00:44:39.657 --> 00:44:45.099]  But humanity is not being caught flat-footed because of info wars and because of your support.
[00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:57.964]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now more important than ever, as we reach the critical heart of the battle, that you spread the word and that you support liberty and that you warn people like you've never done before.
[00:44:58.484 --> 00:44:59.985]  We have come so far together.
[00:45:00.605 --> 00:45:02.165]  Please help keep us on the air.
[00:45:02.345 --> 00:45:03.846]  We're under massive attack right now.
[00:45:04.266 --> 00:45:05.848]  But we're going to win with your help.
[00:45:05.868 --> 00:45:08.610]  We're going to overcome this with your help and with God's blessing.
[00:45:09.051 --> 00:45:11.933]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com and get this book.
[00:45:12.514 --> 00:45:14.596]  Many, many, many years of research have gone into this.
[00:45:14.956 --> 00:45:20.241]  The Great Reset and the War for the World, available right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:20.361 --> 00:45:22.884]  There's also signed copies available as well.
[00:45:23.783 --> 00:45:33.027]  We got a lot of other big projects we're working on that are about to start launching as well, but this is the cavalry because we need the funding and you need this book because it warns the world of the globalist plan.
[00:45:33.468 --> 00:45:35.469]  Get The Great Reset at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:45:36.149 --> 00:45:44.753]  After being deleted by YouTube and social media in 2018, most people did nothing to defend Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:45:45.353 --> 00:45:52.437]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[00:45:53.237 --> 00:45:56.379]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.122]  And without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[00:46:01.043 --> 00:46:10.970]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system, brought to you by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:15.314]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[00:46:16.254 --> 00:46:33.059]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction, Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[00:46:33.079 --> 00:46:41.922]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby.
[00:46:42.262 --> 00:46:46.085]  Who have admitted their intention is to silence Alex Jones.
[00:46:46.846 --> 00:46:58.754]  So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[00:46:59.315 --> 00:47:00.336]  But it only gets worse.
[00:47:01.016 --> 00:47:09.702]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook Crisis Actor Conspiracy Theory, which is demonstrably false.
[00:47:10.223 --> 00:47:22.572]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[00:47:23.432 --> 00:47:28.457]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[00:47:29.118 --> 00:47:34.663]  And over the course of seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[00:47:35.223 --> 00:47:38.166]  We know this because it's all part of the public record.
[00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:41.790]  But these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.553]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[00:47:47.055 --> 00:47:54.222]  They're already, apparently I've heard, that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[00:47:54.382 --> 00:47:56.965]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[00:47:57.065 --> 00:48:04.052]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[00:48:04.372 --> 00:48:06.374]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[00:48:07.255 --> 00:48:11.639]   And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[00:48:11.859 --> 00:48:15.662]  I can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is, and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[00:48:15.982 --> 00:48:16.323]  Why?
[00:48:17.003 --> 00:48:19.705]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[00:48:20.066 --> 00:48:30.334]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence.
[00:48:30.754 --> 00:48:37.623]  Which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[00:48:38.204 --> 00:48:47.837]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist.
[00:48:48.577 --> 00:48:56.143]  Whatever that mysterious, unspecified evidence is, both judges have stripped Jones of his First Amendment right.
[00:48:56.603 --> 00:48:59.045]  But Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:07.231]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working with pedophiles.
[00:49:07.771 --> 00:49:19.160]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda praising the state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:31.369]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[00:49:32.089 --> 00:49:34.031]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[00:49:34.751 --> 00:49:42.973]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[00:49:43.653 --> 00:49:48.795]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[00:49:49.675 --> 00:49:57.517]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones or InfoWars unfairly.
[00:49:58.457 --> 00:50:05.647]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[00:50:06.884 --> 00:50:12.809]  Alex Jones was cancelled from social media in 2018, and is now being cancelled from the U.S.
[00:50:12.849 --> 00:50:14.750]  Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:50:15.551 --> 00:50:18.754]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[00:50:19.514 --> 00:50:26.019]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:30.163]  It relied upon the burden of proof, and it was pretty good.
[00:50:31.483 --> 00:50:34.226]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:50:34.706 --> 00:50:36.508]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:36.548 --> 00:50:38.430]  This is Robert Barnes hosting.
[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.974]  Today we'll be discussing a little bit later, will Donald Trump be indicted?
[00:50:43.354 --> 00:50:52.884]  We'll also be discussing whether or not the judge in the Alex Jones case lied to the jury about the law in the rather peculiar professional history of the judge before she became a judge.
[00:50:53.504 --> 00:50:57.307]  But up first, we're going to be discussing geopolitics around the globe.
[00:50:57.727 --> 00:51:01.350]  Will the deep state lose its globalist battle in Ukraine?
[00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.933]  What is happening with the Great Reset from the Netherlands to Sri Lanka?
[00:51:06.393 --> 00:51:13.658]   What is going to be the geopolitical future Of the globe, in light of the Ukrainian conflict and the Biden administration's policies.
[00:51:14.198 --> 00:51:20.042]  The best independent geopolitical analyst I know anywhere in the globe is the Durand.
[00:51:20.422 --> 00:51:23.264]  You can find them at the durand.locals.com.
[00:51:23.644 --> 00:51:27.046]  You can also find their YouTube, Rumble, Odyssey, and other channels.
[00:51:27.546 --> 00:51:36.332]  They also have separate independent channels, and that's Alex Christoforou, or as I like to say, Christ for you, and Alexander Makoris.
[00:51:36.711 --> 00:51:43.211]   whose family has a George Washington type legacy in Greek politics bringing independence and freedom to that country.
[00:51:43.211 --> 00:51:50.012]   They're both named Alex, so unsurprisingly, they have great names in the name of Alex Jones, but also they're Greeks.
[00:51:50.012 --> 00:51:57.521]   But so let's start to discuss global geopolitics with two of the best analysts I know, Alex and Alexander, welcome to
[00:51:57.521 --> 00:51:58.911]  the show.
[00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:01.711]  Delighted to be here.
[00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:03.411]  Great to be here, Robert.
[00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:21.161]  Can you, Alex, start off with what was supposed to be the objective in Ukraine, and how much has the globalist agenda, the Western agenda, the Biden administration, EU agenda, how much have they been able to achieve that agenda?
[00:52:23.082 --> 00:52:26.865]  Well, the agenda, I believe, was regime change.
[00:52:27.558 --> 00:52:28.078]  In Moscow.
[00:52:28.539 --> 00:52:29.840]  I mean, they wanted Putin out.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.822]  You actually had Biden on a trip to Poland about three months ago.
[00:52:33.922 --> 00:52:39.967]  He actually let it slip that the goal of of Ukraine was regime change in Moscow.
[00:52:40.027 --> 00:52:48.132]  In other words, Ukraine was just going to be kind of this this proxy war that would eventually lead to regime change in the Russian Federation.
[00:52:48.492 --> 00:53:01.164]   Their hopes was that this conflict in Ukraine, coupled with an economic shock and awe type of of war would lead the Putin government to collapse and then,
[00:53:01.164 --> 00:53:07.516]   you know, within a matter of two, three, four weeks, they would have their new guy as the president
[00:53:07.516 --> 00:53:13.806]   of Russia. It did not work. Obviously, we've seen the Russian economy bounce back very, very
[00:53:13.806 --> 00:53:20.634]   strong. We see the Russians are winning the war in Ukraine. They're doing it with a force that is still
[00:53:20.634 --> 00:53:26.306]   geared towards a special military operation. The Russians have not declared war. They have
[00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:31.775]   not thrown all of their military behind this war. As a matter of fact, Robert, the Russians are
[00:53:31.775 --> 00:53:36.945]   even going to hold drills in the east of the country to show that they still have much of
[00:53:36.945 --> 00:53:42.576]   their military not participating in this conflict. So this has been an absolute policy
[00:53:42.576 --> 00:53:43.355]  disaster.
[00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:48.331]  And Alexander, what did they get wrong?
[00:53:48.571 --> 00:53:50.052]  And why did they get it wrong?
[00:53:50.552 --> 00:54:02.596]  What did the Biden administration, the State Department, the EU crowd, the Boris Johnson administration, as long as it lasts, what did they get wrong in assessing what they thought they could achieve versus what the outcome has been in Ukraine?
[00:54:03.886 --> 00:54:06.628]  I think what they got wrong was briefly Russia.
[00:54:06.868 --> 00:54:09.850]  I think they completely underestimated the country.
[00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:22.038]  I think they had a very mistaken idea of the size of its economy, the diversity of its economy, the sophistication of its economic decision-making.
[00:54:22.458 --> 00:54:27.982]  They thought, they really believed that it was a gas station masquerading as a country.
[00:54:28.442 --> 00:54:37.129]   And I think they also greatly underestimated the extreme ability Of Russia's diplomacy and of its military side.
[00:54:37.569 --> 00:54:48.057]  So we see now, you know, the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, travelling to the Middle East, to Africa, on what is starting to look like almost a triumphant tour.
[00:54:48.437 --> 00:54:50.118]  He's got friends everywhere.
[00:54:50.558 --> 00:55:03.275]   Part of the reason he's got friends is because Putin and the Russian leadership have actually said quite clearly, quite explicitly, This is a war about globalisation.
[00:55:03.656 --> 00:55:11.999]  We are resisting the drive of certain people in the West to impose globalisation upon us.
[00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:17.741]  And that message is receiving support across the world.
[00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:30.280]   So they underestimated Russia's inherent potential And they underestimated the amount of political and diplomatic support and economic support Russia is getting around the world.
[00:55:31.235 --> 00:55:33.376]  Alexander, what do you think comes next?
[00:55:33.556 --> 00:55:35.597]  In other words, in the near short-term future.
[00:55:35.757 --> 00:55:43.902]  Both of you have been spectacular at predicting this conflict from the very inception as to what was likely to happen in the near short-term and mid-term.
[00:55:44.282 --> 00:55:46.904]  What do you see as the future of this conflict?
[00:55:46.984 --> 00:55:48.024]  What happens to Ukraine?
[00:55:48.404 --> 00:55:49.465]  What happens to Russia?
[00:55:49.805 --> 00:55:53.107]  What happens to the agenda of the globalists as it relates to Ukraine?
[00:55:55.064 --> 00:56:04.991]  Well, I think if we're talking about Ukraine and Russia, Russia is going to win the war, and it's going to win the war within the next couple of weeks, months at most.
[00:56:05.271 --> 00:56:14.318]  I don't know how... I can't give you a definite timeline, but I think August, the month that's coming, is going to be the decisive month.
[00:56:14.718 --> 00:56:19.942]  We're starting to see battles happening in eastern Ukraine, in southern Ukraine.
[00:56:20.082 --> 00:56:24.365]  It's clear that the Russian military is winning the war and is going to win it big.
[00:56:24.825 --> 00:56:34.077]  Now, at the same time, what's it going to mean for the sort of geopolitical, global way in which international architecture works?
[00:56:34.538 --> 00:56:48.749]   Well, the first thing you've got to see is that people around the world Now see that the EU, the globalist power centres, are not as powerful as they first seemed.
[00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:51.771]  And that's going to give people a lot of encouragement.
[00:56:52.211 --> 00:57:15.014]   It's going to mean a major reordering of the world towards, as Putin has said, this power going back to sovereign states, a repudiation of the globalist project And you're going to see that this project is now going to, over the next couple of weeks and months, face a major setback.
[00:57:15.474 --> 00:57:20.956]  Now, people have been talking about the economic problems in the United States and they're real.
[00:57:21.216 --> 00:57:22.677]  They're indisputably real.
[00:57:23.157 --> 00:57:27.539]  The economic problems in the European Union are far greater.
[00:57:28.059 --> 00:57:33.826]  Because the Europeans are completely aligned with this globalist project.
[00:57:34.266 --> 00:57:39.972]  They believe that propaganda, that Russia was this house of cards, that it would collapse quickly.
[00:57:40.573 --> 00:57:45.759]  And what we now have is the prospect of energy rationing in Europe.
[00:57:46.259 --> 00:57:49.121]  We have a major industrial crisis in Europe.
[00:57:49.561 --> 00:57:56.504]  We have an inflation crisis which makes that in the US seem almost minor by comparison.
[00:57:57.025 --> 00:58:01.747]  So things are looking like, you know, in Europe we're going to see a major shift.
[00:58:02.527 --> 00:58:17.010]   And we've just learned today that Gerhard Schroder, who is the politician, he was the former German Chancellor, He's known to be the representative of German industry, of the big industrial groups.
[00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.014]  He has very strong connections with Volkswagen.
[00:58:20.393 --> 00:58:28.873]   He's now in Moscow on some kind of private, perhaps semi-secret mission, and all the word
[00:58:28.873 --> 00:58:34.273]   is that he's out there, he's now trying to make connections with the Russian leadership
[00:58:34.273 --> 00:58:38.353]  to try to find some way out for Europe from this.
[00:58:38.353 --> 00:58:43.272]   And that will mean the shattering of the EU consensus, the shattering of the globalist
[00:58:43.272 --> 00:58:51.033]   power structures, and a return to a world system based on sovereign states.
[00:58:51.033 --> 00:58:55.972]   And Alex, can you sum up for people that may not have followed European politics in detail
[00:58:55.972 --> 00:59:01.832]   just the number of countries that have suffered political turmoil from blowback from the Ukrainian
[00:59:01.832 --> 00:59:05.832]  conflict in terms of Britain, France, Italy, Bulgaria, etc.?
[00:59:05.832 --> 00:59:15.832]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:59:07.071 --> 00:59:16.177]  Yeah, well France, Macron didn't have such a good go in the recent elections, and he did lose his power in the Parliament.
[00:59:17.137 --> 00:59:23.761]  We had Estonia actually, the government collapsed, though it has now come back again, the same government, but it did collapse.
[00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:30.005]  We had the government in Bulgaria collapse, and I'm not sure where they are right now, but I think they're having a hard time trying to form.
[00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:37.265]   a new coalition and the previous government that did collapse was very much aligned with the WEF,
[00:59:37.265 --> 00:59:44.545]   with the globalist center. You also have, of course, Draghi, Mario Draghi, the former Goldman
[00:59:44.545 --> 00:59:50.144]   Sachs ECB head, who was the unelected prime minister of Italy.
[00:59:50.391 --> 00:59:54.493]  He has bolted and he has decided to call it quits.
[00:59:54.873 --> 01:00:06.218]  He's very happy to leave because he sees what's coming and we are going to have elections in Italy and Robert, I think this is very much kind of the the curse of Zelensky.
[01:00:06.258 --> 01:00:10.039]  It seems like whoever is supporting Zelensky, their government is collapsing.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.040]  Of course, we have Boris Johnson.
[01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:16.802]  Boris Johnson is out, though he may be the new NATO Secretary General, if you believe the Telegraph.
[01:00:17.062 --> 01:00:17.483]  Exactly.
[01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:21.568]  When we come back, we will discuss, will Biden start World War III with China?
[01:00:22.009 --> 01:00:23.691]  And more, right after the break.
[01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:24.772]  So join us then.
[01:00:25.578 --> 01:00:28.561]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes hosting.
[01:00:29.021 --> 01:00:36.248]  Later on, we'll be discussing Will Biden indict Donald Trump as his Hail Mary to save his own skin in the midterms?
[01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:44.716]  Did the judge in the Alex Jones case lie to the jury about the law of libel and the right of apology as a mitigating aspect for damages?
[01:00:45.296 --> 01:00:47.437]  That we'll be discussing a little bit later in the show.
[01:00:48.037 --> 01:01:06.443]  Also, later in the bottom half of the hour, we'll be discussing with The Duran, that you can find at theduran.locals.com, also on YouTube and Rumble and other platforms, the issue of whether or not we will end up going to war with China, and is that a realistic risk moving forward?
[01:01:06.943 --> 01:01:09.466]  But first up, what about the future of Europe?
[01:01:09.907 --> 01:01:11.208]  Is Europe collapsing?
[01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:12.189]  What might be?
[01:01:12.249 --> 01:01:14.592]  Is Europe just going to become a future Disneyland?
[01:01:14.652 --> 01:01:17.256]  A place you go and visit for the history and the tourism?
[01:01:18.017 --> 01:01:19.859]  That is the question at this segment.
[01:01:20.399 --> 01:01:26.407]  Alexander, you mentioned the collapsing aspect of Europe's economy, of critical aspects of that economy.
[01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:40.975]  The historic deal that Putin did with Germany to establish cheap natural gas in exchange for them getting rid of nuclear energy to satisfy their greens, in exchange gave them an economic edge in industrial production and kept Germany's industrial economic engine alive.
[01:01:41.415 --> 01:01:48.318]  Now they're scrapping all that and they're talking about maybe you shouldn't shower for a couple of months and maybe you should go to a heating center somewhere.
[01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:51.180]  What is the future of Germany?
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.022]  What is the future of Europe economically given its current pace?
[01:01:56.804 --> 01:01:58.906]  In a word, Robert, it's bleak.
[01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:03.709]  It's very, very difficult to be at all optimistic about Europe.
[01:02:03.749 --> 01:02:07.252]  In fact, the more pessimistic you are, the more realistic you are.
[01:02:07.532 --> 01:02:09.113]  You summed it up perfectly.
[01:02:09.594 --> 01:02:18.421]  The whole economic system in Germany was based upon importing cheap energy from Russia.
[01:02:18.461 --> 01:02:19.822]  That was why they did that.
[01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:22.664]  They didn't do it out of charity for the Russians.
[01:02:23.204 --> 01:02:27.945]  German industry needs cheap power in order to remain competitive.
[01:02:28.365 --> 01:02:36.067]  It doesn't have the giant economies of scale that you find, for example, in China in the United States.
[01:02:36.128 --> 01:02:45.615]   So this was this energy partnership that they created and it was primary driver of the German economy, and because the German economy is
[01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:52.245]   the dominant economy in Europe, it was what kept the whole locomotive of the European Union
[01:02:52.245 --> 01:02:59.125]   together and enabled the European Union, the people who lead it, to carry through with their
[01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:05.096]   ideas of EU unity, integration, basically doing away with sovereign states within Europe,
[01:03:05.096 --> 01:03:06.236]  all that kind of thing.
[01:03:06.236 --> 01:03:12.995]   Now the Germans, going along with this idea that they could smash Russia via this crisis
[01:03:12.995 --> 01:03:17.275]  in Ukraine, have cut themselves off from Russian gas.
[01:03:17.704 --> 01:03:20.506]  And it's important to understand they're never going to get it back.
[01:03:20.987 --> 01:03:32.777]   The Russians will never provide them with gas in the same scale, in the same way that they did previously. So the Germans have now locked themselves in to
[01:03:32.777 --> 01:03:39.277]   a situation of long-term uncompetitiveness. They're going to pay an awful lot more
[01:03:39.277 --> 01:03:44.657]   for their energy than other countries, more for their energy than the United States,
[01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:51.086]   which produces most of its energy, more for its energy than, say, China will, because
[01:03:51.086 --> 01:03:58.367]   China will be getting energy from Russia. So the Germans have set themselves up for the
[01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:07.626]   deindustrialization of their country, for a prolonged industrial crisis in Germany, and it's
[01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:14.427]   impossible to see how that can be turned round. And of course, on top of that, you have in
[01:04:14.427 --> 01:04:24.646]   Europe a political structure that's been built up over the last 70 years, which is incredibly
[01:04:24.646 --> 01:04:26.067]  stifling.
[01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:40.323]  It's not got much democratic legitimacy or vitality because power has been drained away from the states to the EU centre, which remains, and it's important to say this, unelected.
[01:04:40.862 --> 01:04:49.725]  That means that the Centre cannot itself make decisions which people around Europe are really going to sign up to and accept.
[01:04:49.946 --> 01:05:00.670]  You know, when the EU Centre talks about sacrifices, why should people accept those sacrifices when they're demanded of them by people who are unelected?
[01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:15.384]   But at the same time, the EU Centre itself, and by extension if you like, the people who run things in Germany, Don't like strong sovereign states across Europe able to make their own decisions.
[01:05:15.865 --> 01:05:21.134]  And that means that we have no political class, no political leadership.
[01:05:21.838 --> 01:05:27.702]  Anywhere in Europe that can actually plan and find a way out of this problem.
[01:05:28.122 --> 01:05:30.364]  So we are in a very, very bad place.
[01:05:30.964 --> 01:05:49.177]  Far worse than the one you will find in the United States, where you still have a high degree, a real degree of vitality in your political system and where your economy is much better, much more self-sufficient and far more resilient in face of these kinds of problems.
[01:05:50.177 --> 01:06:05.190]  And Alex, it doesn't look like there's much hope in the UK elections to replace BoJo, Boris Johnson, and that both candidates that appear to be there seem to be featuring the same defects of policy decision-making that Boris Johnson himself represented.
[01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:10.875]  It looks almost like a pre-Trump American electoral scene of twiddle dumb or twiddle dumber.
[01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:17.701]  What's your take on the UK prospects of the two existing... Does it matter which candidate wins the UK primary contest?
[01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:31.295]  Not really, but in Greece we have a saying, Robert, we say in politics, especially when you get to the level of Prime Minister or President, we always say the next guy is going to be worse than the previous guy.
[01:06:31.615 --> 01:06:34.715]  And I think you're seeing that in the UK play out.
[01:06:35.255 --> 01:06:42.677]  I don't think it matters too much whether it's Sunak or Truss, but all indicators point to Truss at the moment.
[01:06:43.297 --> 01:06:52.419]   But either way, I think you're going to get a much A much worse version of Boris Johnson at 10 Downing Street.
[01:06:52.599 --> 01:07:09.542]  And if it's any indication what to expect from the next Prime Minister of the UK, all you have to do is look at that viral video that is making the rounds on the interwebs, where during the debate, it appears that the host of the debate fainted or had some sort of medical issue.
[01:07:09.702 --> 01:07:13.763]  And you could just see the reaction from Truss, the panic and the fear.
[01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.203]  And she almost ran away.
[01:07:16.063 --> 01:07:22.146]  No doubt about it.
[01:07:22.286 --> 01:07:36.654]  When we come back on the bottom half of the hour, we'll discuss whether or not the Biden administration will end up waging war in China.
[01:07:37.234 --> 01:07:41.016]  We want to remind all of you that you are the front line in InfoWars.
[01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:53.385]   The reason why InfoWars still exists Despite the massive media assaults and attacks on InfoWars, on Alex Jones, the weaponized lawfare taking place is because you, the audience, keep it alive.
[01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:55.006]  You are the front line.
[01:07:55.307 --> 01:07:59.370]  So I like to say, never forgive, never forget.
[01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.010]  Hold the line.
[01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:04.531]  It is up to you to hold the line for InfoWars.
[01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:06.832]  To keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:08:07.132 --> 01:08:08.792]  To keep that information out there.
[01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:15.153]  Because this is not only about Alex Jones' right to speak, it is more importantly about your right to listen.
[01:08:15.493 --> 01:08:16.534]  Your right to hear.
[01:08:16.894 --> 01:08:22.055]  Your right to find independent information and you get to evaluate its credibility or confidence.
[01:08:22.415 --> 01:08:34.584]  In the same way, it's only InfoWars that has brought to you independent voices from across the globe that are independent of and separate from InfoWars, like the Duran that you can find at theduran.locals.com.
[01:08:35.045 --> 01:08:36.426]  The Duran, like the band.
[01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:38.968]  And so, continue to support InfoWars.

[01:08:50.476 --> 01:08:54.719]  There's something on there that you can find value from that you're using in your everyday life.
[01:08:55.079 --> 01:08:56.140]  You can do so.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:56.540]  Why?
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.381]  Because you are the front of the line.
[01:08:58.662 --> 01:09:02.704]  My great-granddaddy was the Colonel Prescott who said, don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes.
[01:09:03.065 --> 01:09:04.866]  Well, you can continue to hold the line.

[01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.969]  When we come back, are we going to war with China?
[01:09:09.389 --> 01:09:11.472]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:09:11.532 --> 01:09:13.234]  This is Robert Barnes hosting.
[01:09:13.634 --> 01:09:24.006]  We are on with the Duran, who you can find at theduran.locals.com as well as in a range of other platforms from YouTube to Rumble from BitChute to Odyssey.
[01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:39.724]  Let's talk about one of the topics that's on a lot of people's minds because after it looked like we were risking World War 3 with Russia, now it looks like aspects of our deep state and the Biden administration want to see if maybe we could have World War 3 with China instead!
[01:09:40.725 --> 01:09:51.051]  Indeed, the logic where we suddenly saw a bunch of articles exposing a range of issues about China's influence in America, all out of the blue, back-to-back, by institutional media.
[01:09:51.391 --> 01:09:56.054]  Suddenly we're now concerned with China buying up US real estate near military bases.
[01:09:56.294 --> 01:10:03.258]  Suddenly we're now concerned with their telecom giants buying property near places that could interfere with our nuclear arsenal.
[01:10:03.518 --> 01:10:08.557]   Suddenly now, General Milley is running around, Mr. Wilkster, running around Southeast Asia
[01:10:08.557 --> 01:10:10.997]  saying China is the great threat.
[01:10:10.997 --> 01:10:14.557]   Even the UK premier candidates were on script when they saw that.
[01:10:14.557 --> 01:10:17.297]   Then they started talking about China being the great threat.
[01:10:17.297 --> 01:10:21.978]   Now we're sending Nancy Pelosi herself, who just in a drunken stupor might lead to World
[01:10:21.978 --> 01:10:24.518]  War III, going to Taiwan.
[01:10:24.518 --> 01:10:29.237]   So the question is, how much risk are we that once again the globalists in the White House
[01:10:29.237 --> 01:10:35.158]   and the incompetents in the Biden administration may stumble and bumble us into World War III?
[01:10:35.158 --> 01:10:39.957]  Alexander, how big is the risk that we go to war with China?
[01:10:39.957 --> 01:10:41.478]  I'm afraid it's a real risk.
[01:10:41.478 --> 01:10:46.478]   And can I just say stumble and bumble is about the right word, because what I think has happened
[01:10:46.478 --> 01:10:51.518]   is that we've gone from a position which was Donald Trump's position, which is that we
[01:10:51.518 --> 01:10:54.637]  start to push back on China in economics.
[01:10:54.637 --> 01:10:56.318]  We impose tariffs.
[01:10:56.318 --> 01:10:57.318]  We do.
[01:10:57.481 --> 01:11:11.212]  We root out Chinese companies, we root out Chinese influence, we build up the industrial base of the United States, we deal with, you know, we look at, we concern ourselves with the welfare of the United States.
[01:11:11.592 --> 01:11:19.158]  We've gone from that perspective towards China, which is a fully legitimate one, and one which the Chinese themselves understood.
[01:11:19.458 --> 01:11:22.160]  They may not have liked it, but they understood it.
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:54.717]   To a geopolitical confrontation with China, An attempt, if you like, to roll back Chinese influence, not because it concerns the United States, the welfare of the United States, in the same way that Trump was worried about, but because China in some ways is seen as standing in the way of the globalist project, the WEF project, because the Chinese have managed to turn it to their own advantage and they've been increasing their power in a way that some people don't like.
[01:11:55.277 --> 01:12:04.361]  So we've had these strange moves over Taiwan, which I don't think, frankly, was a real problem a short time ago.
[01:12:04.381 --> 01:12:08.462]  I don't think the Chinese were planning an invasion of Taiwan.
[01:12:08.943 --> 01:12:21.408]  But the way this whole thing has been arranged, with Pelosi going, with all this rhetoric about opening up what is in effect a Taiwanese embassy in Washington, that's suddenly become an issue.
[01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:33.737]   And what's made this whole thing utterly toxic It's at the same time that the United States has been making these moves over Taiwan, which are hostile to China.
[01:12:34.177 --> 01:12:42.918]  We have Biden coming along and telling Xi Jinping, well actually we continue with our one China policy.
[01:12:43.238 --> 01:12:45.859]  We still accept that Taiwan is part of China.
[01:12:46.159 --> 01:12:49.599]  We still recognize your government as the government of China.
[01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:52.940]  And the Chinese, whatever they are, they're not stupid.
[01:12:53.567 --> 01:12:58.475]  And they can see that this is a game which is a double game that is being played.
[01:12:59.056 --> 01:13:09.031]   And Xi Jinping actually told Biden, you can actually see it in the Chinese readout, you tell me one thing, And your administration does another.
[01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:12.333]  In other words, I don't trust you.
[01:13:12.993 --> 01:13:20.897]  And where trust goes between two powerful countries like China and the United States, it becomes impossible.
[01:13:21.297 --> 01:13:24.999]  Because at that point, you can't rely on any discussions.
[01:13:25.039 --> 01:13:37.427]   You can't assume that if Biden says, look, I'm not going to send troops to Taiwan, or Pelosi's only going there in a private capacity, The Chinese don't believe that anymore.
[01:13:37.887 --> 01:13:46.815]  So we see the Chinese now making their counter moves, the US, or rather the administration, talking about pushing back to China.
[01:13:47.255 --> 01:13:56.483]  It's very easy to see how we could miscalculate and find ourselves in a shooting war, which nobody actually, I think, really wants.
[01:13:57.532 --> 01:13:58.192]  No doubt about it.
[01:13:58.692 --> 01:14:10.015]  Alex, you've mentioned the, and both of you have mentioned, the ties between the Clinton administration and the institutionalization of certain policies and personnel that date to that.
[01:14:10.455 --> 01:14:16.657]  Can you explain for people why that explains some of the recklessness that we have seen from the Biden administration?
[01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:25.059]  What many of you, as you have both said, one of the, maybe the most incompetent administration in American recent modern political history.
[01:14:26.246 --> 01:14:30.228]  Yeah, a lot of this foreign policy, Robert, comes from obviously the Department of State.
[01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:32.969]  The Department of State is Hillary Clinton's domain.
[01:14:33.349 --> 01:14:46.915]  You look at people like Blinken and Newland and even Sullivan, who's not in the Department of State, but he plays a central role with national security and he's very much connected and he works with Blinken.
[01:14:47.255 --> 01:14:56.521]   They're the ones that are formulating, it appears they're the ones that are formulating All of these policies, whether it's Ukraine or it's now Taiwan and China.
[01:14:57.041 --> 01:15:11.050]  And we just have to go back maybe six months ago to a year ago when the Russians were telling the United States, they were saying, look, all Ukraine has to do is just say that they're going to stay neutral.
[01:15:11.731 --> 01:15:17.615]  Just just tell them to say that they're going to stay neutral and then everything is going to be OK.
[01:15:18.706 --> 01:15:21.049]  They could not get Zelensky to admit that.
[01:15:21.089 --> 01:15:27.577]  And now here we are with Taiwan, where China is saying, look, don't send Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.
[01:15:28.378 --> 01:15:31.802]  You need to recognize the one China policy.
[01:15:32.469 --> 01:15:36.810]  And now we're seeing that the United States is stuck in a box.
[01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:37.830]  They've boxed themselves in.
[01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:44.692]  If they don't send Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, the Biden White House is going to look weak and it's going to look like she's lost.
[01:15:44.852 --> 01:15:48.553]  If they send her to Taiwan, God knows where things are going to go.
[01:15:48.573 --> 01:16:01.196]  Mitch McConnell said the other day, he said, Nancy Pelosi will have to go to Taiwan because if she doesn't, then it's like, and I quote, handing China sort of a victory of sorts.
[01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:07.147]  These guys in the Department of State, they have completely boxed the United States in.
[01:16:07.707 --> 01:16:16.213]  And either option, whatever Nancy Pelosi does, is not going to be a good option for the United States, for China, and for the world.
[01:16:17.652 --> 01:16:22.135]  Alexander, what should we be on the alert for for risk escalating?
[01:16:22.255 --> 01:16:25.077]  Is it watching to see what happens when Pelosi goes?
[01:16:25.417 --> 01:16:32.162]  You mentioned that in the past this Clinton-influenced State Department may think China's just bluffing and how that may be wrong.
[01:16:33.402 --> 01:16:37.445]  What should we be on the alert for for escalating the risk in the near short term?
[01:16:39.046 --> 01:16:43.589]  Well, I think the big thing to understand about China is that it's not a country you should bluff.
[01:16:44.761 --> 01:16:50.443]  Country that will always call your bluff because that's the nature of Chinese society.
[01:16:50.503 --> 01:16:57.565]  They will not let themselves be humiliated by the United States as they see it.
[01:16:57.625 --> 01:17:00.166]  They will certainly not be humiliated over Taiwan.
[01:17:00.766 --> 01:17:11.473]  Which for them is a national security issue, and it's also an issue which we must always remember, it goes directly to the heart of the legitimacy of the Chinese government.
[01:17:11.633 --> 01:17:31.987]   Now, if Nancy Pelosi goes to Taiwan, as she says that she will, and starts talking to Taiwan as if Taiwan is an independent country, and gives the impression that the administration And the Chinese don't buy this idea that she's going to Taiwan without the green light from the administration.
[01:17:32.227 --> 01:17:57.525]   If Nancy Pelosi goes to Taiwan and starts saying the United States will stand by Taiwan against Chinese threats, will defend Taiwan against Chinese threats, well at that point the Chinese will feel under enormous pressure from within To respond to that, and that could result in a military response.
[01:17:57.846 --> 01:18:00.187]  Now the Chinese officials have all been saying this.
[01:18:00.207 --> 01:18:03.409]  They've been giving private warnings to the administration.
[01:18:03.949 --> 01:18:12.334]  I understand that a Chinese official, a top Chinese official, actually recently said that their military is ready to take action.
[01:18:12.794 --> 01:18:17.299]  And was it their military is ready to take action and we don't know what kind of action they might take.
[01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:21.963]  A no-fly zone, a sea blockade, something more, something less.
[01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:23.044]  We don't know.
[01:18:23.505 --> 01:18:25.767]  What does the United States do?
[01:18:26.227 --> 01:18:26.988]  Does it act?
[01:18:27.432 --> 01:18:28.012]  Extraordinary.
[01:18:28.072 --> 01:18:36.396]  When we come back, we'll be talking about the Great Reset and its setbacks in Sri Lanka and Holland and across the globe.
[01:18:36.216 --> 01:18:41.216]  So that's how we could end up in a real conflict situation.
[01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.216]  Extraordinary.
[01:18:42.216 --> 01:18:46.936]   When we come back, we'll be talking about the Great Reset and its setbacks in Sri Lanka
[01:18:46.936 --> 01:18:49.096]  and Holland and across the globe.
[01:18:49.096 --> 01:18:58.216]  So join us when we come back from the break.
[01:18:58.285 --> 01:19:05.430]  The information that InfoWars is covering is literally the blueprint to counter their great reset with the Great Awakening.
[01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:10.394]  When you support InfoWars by getting great products, you keep the tip of the spear on the air.
[01:19:10.774 --> 01:19:23.163]  You see the enemy hates us probably more than even Trump because we are identifying who they are and what incredible psychotic control freaks they are and how humanity can be awakened to defeat them.
[01:19:23.963 --> 01:19:32.151]  Right now, we're doing a major fundraiser to fund our legal bills and to fund things into the future and to make sure we get stronger, not weaker.

[01:19:35.734 --> 01:19:43.281]  Now, right now, we're running a huge sale and a lot of great products that have been sold out for a long time, thank God, have finally come in right on time.
[01:19:43.301 --> 01:19:44.001]  The cavalry's here.

[01:20:04.296 --> 01:20:06.118]  But inflammation is such a key thing.

[01:20:50.538 --> 01:20:51.161]  Please take action.
[01:20:54.397 --> 01:20:58.839]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes guest hosting here with the Durand.
[01:20:58.939 --> 01:21:14.687]  You can find them at the Durand.locals.com, the best geopolitical analysts that I have found anywhere that have been above and ahead of the curve consistently and constantly for years, but especially over the crazy last six months we've experienced in global geopolitics.
[01:21:15.188 --> 01:21:17.649]  So let's talk about the global reset.
[01:21:18.429 --> 01:21:35.763]  Uh, and then we'll later talk about the best of the clown worlds, of which there have been so many that Alex has been able to put up a daily clown world now for months because there's, as crazy as it gets, it gets a little bit more crazy after that, thanks in part to VanderCrazy and others in our global political leadership structure.
[01:21:36.483 --> 01:21:39.905]  But Alexander, we've seen some blowback from the Great Reset.
[01:21:39.925 --> 01:21:50.350]  We were seeing it in the Dutch protest, we're seeing it now in some German protests, we're seeing it now, we saw it in Sri Lanka, the government overthrown, we're seeing talk of it in Panama, talk of it in Canada.
[01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:59.355]  Can you describe what the landscape is of how aspects of the Great Reset agenda, particularly as to fertilizer, fuel and food, are backfiring on a global scale?
[01:22:00.527 --> 01:22:15.260]  They're absolutely backfiring on a global scale because what the people who run this system, who created the system, have never really understood is how economies work, how people do business, how goods move around.
[01:22:15.721 --> 01:22:21.202]   They've assumed that they can operate a system of total control. And they've
[01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:26.441]   also assumed that if you press the button and shut one thing down, well, other things will
[01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:34.121]   continue to operate in exactly the same way as they did previously. So what they've done is that they've
[01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:40.561]   closed down parts of the global economy through sanctions at the same time as they've tried
[01:22:40.561 --> 01:22:47.121]   to inflate others through money printing through currency expansion. And of course, at the
[01:22:47.121 --> 01:22:51.161]   same time, as they've done all of this, they've always thought, well,
[01:22:52.094 --> 01:23:00.138]  A bit of chaos in the system is not a bad thing because, of course, it works out to our advantage.
[01:23:00.799 --> 01:23:02.659]  And, of course, it doesn't really work like that.
[01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.541]  Nothing actually ever works in that sort of way.
[01:23:05.901 --> 01:23:20.385]   What is happening is that the vast amounts of money that have been spent, produced, which have flooded the world, have eroded purchasing power, they've disrupted supply
[01:23:20.385 --> 01:23:27.185]   chains, they've distorted prices, and of course the sanctions, on top of all of that, have
[01:23:27.185 --> 01:23:33.885]   disrupted the supply chains even more. And so goods are in short supply, people are
[01:23:33.885 --> 01:23:41.506]   experiencing inflation, living standards are falling, they're collapsing in country after country
[01:23:41.506 --> 01:23:45.466]   after country, and of course people are protesting.
[01:23:45.758 --> 01:23:47.139]  And who are they protesting?
[01:23:47.419 --> 01:23:57.308]  They're protesting against precisely the governments which have implemented these policies, which the people who are, if you like, the globalists, have relied upon.
[01:23:57.768 --> 01:23:59.470]  So it's been a massive blowback.
[01:24:00.232 --> 01:24:01.992]  And we see political crisis.
[01:24:02.073 --> 01:24:07.634]  I mean, you identified, Robert, and Alex did country after country where we see political crises.
[01:24:07.674 --> 01:24:08.694]  We see this in Britain.
[01:24:09.454 --> 01:24:11.655]  We see this, I think, now in Germany.
[01:24:11.675 --> 01:24:13.675]  It's coming over the horizon in Germany.
[01:24:14.055 --> 01:24:15.096]  We see this in Italy.
[01:24:15.136 --> 01:24:16.156]  We see this in Canada.
[01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:17.096]  We see this in Panama.
[01:24:17.116 --> 01:24:20.297]  We've seen a total economic collapse in Sri Lanka.
[01:24:20.717 --> 01:24:25.138]  We're going to see much more of this because governments are weak.
[01:24:25.706 --> 01:24:27.911]  Because globalists have made them so.
[01:24:28.412 --> 01:24:32.381]  And without strong governments able to make strong decisions...
[01:24:33.132 --> 01:24:36.815]  Things are just going to go and continue to get worse.
[01:24:37.475 --> 01:24:42.798]  And that's, I'm afraid, the situation that this Great Reset has ended up with.
[01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:51.424]  They think that they're the masters of the universe, except, of course, that the universe is bigger than they are, and they're losing control.
[01:24:51.885 --> 01:24:56.908]  And they're pulling everybody down with them at the same time that they're losing this control.
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:16.214]  Alex, as part of the inanity and insanity we've witnessed over the past six months, one of them you've documented in detail in your daily videos at Alex Christoforou, is the clown worlds that just continue to proliferate, where the hardest choice of the day is to figure out which clown world to highlight.
[01:25:16.635 --> 01:25:24.340]   Whether it's the Biden administration not being able to spell the word person, or spelling it like peon, or spelling it like peasant, Oh god, that's a great question.
[01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:30.451]   Or whether it's all the crazy Russian things that have been banned not just tennis players and chess players and symphony
[01:25:30.451 --> 01:25:35.520]   players But older novelist prior music even cats in trees have been
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:39.961]   banned because they're Russian What have been some of your favorite?
[01:25:39.961 --> 01:25:47.551]   Clown worlds in the past several months. Oh God, that's that's a great question. I think banning the
[01:25:47.551 --> 01:25:50.600]   letter Z That was a great one, especially because
[01:25:50.961 --> 01:25:56.850]   Zelensky well here you're essentially banning Zelensky's name so Ukraine banning the letters. He actually
[01:25:56.850 --> 01:26:06.774]   that was Germany that kicked that off Germany was, there was a province in Germany that actually banned the letter Z and they kicked off the whole chain reaction.
[01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:12.537]  And then you had entire countries, I believe it was Lithuania or Latvia, that actually banned the letter Z. That one was great.
[01:26:12.798 --> 01:26:17.561]  I think, Robert, you came up with one of the classic ones, which was General Pavel.
[01:26:18.481 --> 01:26:30.629]  Which was, which was a story that the UK tabloids were reporting on every day, this Russian general, because the generals were dying, you know, every single day, Putin was losing a general in the war.
[01:26:30.689 --> 01:26:32.751]  And so he had to dig deep into his bench.
[01:26:33.391 --> 01:26:37.694]  And he found this General Pavel guy, he was going to be the new general for this war.
[01:26:37.814 --> 01:26:42.958]  And the guy ended up being like a border patrol guard in Uzbekistan.
[01:26:43.418 --> 01:26:46.140]  And they dug up a photo, which was like 20 years old.
[01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:58.509]   And Biden Who can forget Bidenopolis when Biden gave his speech and he said, I am very much a Greek and they used to call me Joe Bidenopolis and that name has stuck.
[01:26:58.649 --> 01:27:05.454]  And finally, the last one, Robert, which I found absolutely hilarious, was the goat of Kiev.
[01:27:05.734 --> 01:27:10.098]  Not the ghost of Kiev, which Kindinger was dumb enough to retweet.
[01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:22.517]  But the goat of Kiev, which was this goat that set off a tripwire and supposedly took out a whole Russian brigade or something like that, the story was just fantastical.
[01:27:23.498 --> 01:27:24.079]  Extraordinary.
[01:27:24.359 --> 01:27:27.943]  Now, Alex, can you tell everybody where people can find you and Alexander?
[01:27:29.324 --> 01:27:32.805]  Yes, you can find us at theduran.locals.com.
[01:27:32.845 --> 01:27:35.086]  That is where we put all of our content.
[01:27:35.486 --> 01:27:41.888]  That is the content that we make together on the Duran channel, as well as the content that we make individually.
[01:27:42.289 --> 01:27:46.250]  Alexander has a channel on all the platforms, Alexander Mercouris.
[01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:53.060]  Just search for it and you will find it on Odyssey, on Rumble, on YouTube, on Bitchute.
[01:27:53.581 --> 01:27:58.408]  And you can look for my channel, Alex Christopher, which you will also find on all of the major platforms.
[01:27:58.488 --> 01:28:01.192]  And you can also find us on Telegram as well.
[01:28:01.592 --> 01:28:02.434]  So look for us there.
[01:28:03.024 --> 01:28:03.564]  Fantastic!
[01:28:03.685 --> 01:28:04.405]  Thank you very much.
[01:28:04.985 --> 01:28:08.028]  Again, the Duran are the best geopolitical analysts I've found.
[01:28:08.068 --> 01:28:09.429]  You can get their daily reports.
[01:28:09.509 --> 01:28:14.672]  It's on my daily must-read, must-watch list that I go through every day.
[01:28:14.732 --> 01:28:18.395]  So, highly recommend them for ongoing independent information.
[01:28:18.895 --> 01:28:23.698]  Free of the institutional corporate media bias and globalist preferences.
[01:28:24.038 --> 01:28:38.167]  If you want independent information about what's happening in the world and how it might impact you here at home in the United States or wherever you may be, the place to go is thedurand.locals.com or find them at any of the other platforms that Alex mentioned.
[01:28:38.587 --> 01:28:42.613]  Remember everybody, you are the key to Infowars surviving.
[01:28:42.893 --> 01:28:45.997]  You are the key to independent free press surviving.
[01:28:46.317 --> 01:28:56.071]  There is a lawfare war going on against Alex Jones and Infowars right now that is part and parcel of a bigger cancel culture censorship suppression effort.
[01:28:56.491 --> 01:29:06.660]  We've seen it with Ukraine talking about putting people on watch lists and putting people on, you're not allowed to talk about this list and put a wide range of people.
[01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:08.242]  But it's not just there.
[01:29:08.522 --> 01:29:09.623]  It is all over the place.
[01:29:09.883 --> 01:29:15.028]  And that is why the key is for you to continue to hold the line.
[01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.870]  Because you are the front line.
[01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:18.071]  They can't get through.
[01:29:18.131 --> 01:29:32.730]  And as long as they can't, InfoWars stays alive.
[01:29:32.744 --> 01:29:35.505]  Our number one bestseller is now back in stock.
[01:29:36.006 --> 01:29:37.166]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:30:12.347 --> 01:30:13.888]  But who knows supply chain breakdowns.
[01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:15.309]  It may not happen.

[01:30:29.943 --> 01:30:31.864]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:31.924 --> 01:30:33.725]  This is Robert Barnes guest hosting.
[01:30:34.145 --> 01:30:37.827]  Today we are on with one of the best economic analysts out there.
[01:30:37.907 --> 01:30:42.449]  Someone who can make economic information both accessible and actionable.
[01:30:43.249 --> 01:30:51.573]  And he had the inspired vision, or whatever else you may call it, to be involved in a case I'm helping bring to sue the Federal Reserve.
[01:30:52.153 --> 01:30:53.896]  Maybe that's why he left the country briefly.
[01:30:54.276 --> 01:30:59.203]  But we'll be talking about that and other factors with the one and only George Gammon.
[01:30:59.603 --> 01:31:00.385]  George, welcome to the show.
[01:31:01.647 --> 01:31:02.748]  Hey, thanks for having me, Robert.
[01:31:02.768 --> 01:31:03.268]  Good to be here.
[01:31:03.588 --> 01:31:06.870]  So, George, we're in an extraordinary economic environment.
[01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:14.395]  You break it down on your YouTube videos on a regular basis and at Rebel Capitalist, which people can find online and as well on YouTube.
[01:31:15.636 --> 01:31:22.440]  In terms of, it turns out that maybe it wasn't such a genius idea to double the amount of currency in a year.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:28.824]  Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to create lockdowns that have continuous supply chain problems.
[01:31:29.184 --> 01:31:39.812]  That maybe it was the globalists who took the bait, not Putin who took the bait by going into Ukraine, because the sanctions appear to be backfiring on us, not on Russia, at least if the ruble is any measurement.
[01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:49.919]  What do you think, how much did printing all of the money, how much is that the real source of our inflation issues, and the lockdown so much part of our supply side issues today?
[01:31:51.240 --> 01:31:52.340]  Well, it's simple, Robert.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:32:01.213]   When you look at what creates consumer price inflation, and that's simply when you increase demand, Or you decrease supply.
[01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:03.637]  It's just basic economics 101.
[01:32:04.238 --> 01:32:10.226]  So what the central planners did back in 2020 and in 2021 is they did both.
[01:32:10.566 --> 01:32:13.170]  They increased demand while decreasing supply.
[01:32:13.983 --> 01:32:17.126]  And that they sat back and said, well, don't worry about inflation.
[01:32:17.306 --> 01:32:25.713]  Well, now we're feeling the effects of what the central planners did as a response to what we call the cerveza sickness.
[01:32:25.833 --> 01:32:36.042]  You know, the mainstream media likes to say that what we're seeing now in terms of price hikes is all a result of Putin or it's a result of COVID.
[01:32:36.282 --> 01:32:37.163]  And it's not.
[01:32:37.363 --> 01:32:40.286]  It's a result of their response to these things.
[01:32:40.866 --> 01:32:47.988]  So, if they would not have issued those sanctions, to your point, we would not see gas prices as high as they are today.
[01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:55.351]  If they would not have, quote-unquote, printed all of this money and sent out STEMI checks, while at the same time crushing supply.
[01:32:55.751 --> 01:33:00.951]   through destroying supply chains that will take a long, long time to come back,
[01:33:00.951 --> 01:33:04.951]   and they destroyed these supply chains by locking everyone in a cage for a year,
[01:33:04.951 --> 01:33:12.051]   or in some cases longer, we would not have had the significant consumer prices increases that we've seen.
[01:33:12.051 --> 01:33:18.851]   You know, now over 9%, which is what the CPI states, and as you know, that's wildly understated.
[01:33:18.851 --> 01:33:26.220]   And the Fed is coming out today, pretty much as we speak, and they're going to raise rates again to try to combat
[01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:30.631]   inflation, and they're doing this while the yield curve, the twos and
[01:33:30.631 --> 01:33:38.650]   tens, which has got about a 95% accuracy in terms of predicting a recession, is inverted.
[01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:43.351]   And it's not just the twos and tens that are inverted, and I can explain that further if you want me to,
[01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:48.751]   but it's also the one-year Treasury, the yield is higher than the 10-year,
[01:33:48.751 --> 01:33:55.951]   and now the six-month Treasury is yield higher than the 10-year yield.
[01:33:55.951 --> 01:33:59.951]   So these are all things that tell us that a recession is coming while at the same time
[01:33:59.951 --> 01:34:06.550]   the Fed is increasing interest rates to try to bring down the consumer price increases
[01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:11.951]   that they themselves created back in 2020 in the response to COVID,
[01:34:11.951 --> 01:34:16.451]  and more recently, to your point, in response to Russia-Ukraine.
[01:34:17.114 --> 01:34:17.754]  It's insane.
[01:34:17.794 --> 01:34:22.997]  When we come back after the break, we'll break down, are we facing a potential stock bubble collapse?
[01:34:23.017 --> 01:34:25.899]  Are we facing a potential housing price collapse?
[01:34:26.279 --> 01:34:38.025]  Are we facing future economic problems that are produced by, as George has identified, an extended ideology that the Great Reset is just the recreation of an older script that dates all the way back to the Club of Rome?
[01:34:38.505 --> 01:34:48.472]  In terms of an idea of trying to control people and control the population in ways that is going to be counterproductive and self-destructive for sovereignty, freedom, and liberty in America.
[01:34:48.792 --> 01:34:56.677]  We'll also discuss where he got the inspired idea to go after the Federal Reserve, to expose what their real books are, their real documents are.
[01:34:56.998 --> 01:35:00.260]  And we'll discuss part of the status of that suit when we come back after the break.
[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.440]  You can find him at George Gammon.
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:04.101]  Just search George Gammon on YouTube.
[01:35:04.441 --> 01:35:08.442]  You can find him in a Rebel Capitalist, and we'll discuss both of those things when we come back.
[01:35:08.862 --> 01:35:13.303]  Remember, as always, folks, you are the front line that keeps InfoWars alive.
[01:35:13.623 --> 01:35:18.964]  You are the front line that allows independent information of independent sources to be heard by you.
[01:35:19.304 --> 01:35:23.165]  So hold the line, support InfoWars, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:35:23.465 --> 01:35:24.705]  We'll be back right after the break.
[01:35:25.305 --> 01:35:27.127]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:35:27.207 --> 01:35:28.367]  This is Robert Barnes.
[01:35:28.908 --> 01:35:44.300]  In the bottom half of the hour, we'll be discussing whether or not Joe Biden plans to use a Hail Mary by indicting Donald Trump in the District of Columbia, and whether or not the judge in the Alex Jones trial lied to the jury about what libel law really is.
[01:35:45.020 --> 01:36:01.754]  But now we're with George Gammon discussing the future of American and global economics given how the central planners are doing their best job to implode it on all of us in the near short term and maybe even the future if we don't find ways to reverse it.
[01:36:02.214 --> 01:36:10.561]  As well as later on we'll be discussing with George suing the Federal Reserve in the coming suit coming after Labor Day this year known as George Gammon versus the Federal Reserve.
[01:36:11.061 --> 01:36:18.968]  But until then, let's first, what do you think the probabilities are of a housing market collapse, a stock market collapse?
[01:36:19.288 --> 01:36:30.798]  Because you look at what the Fed is doing, and as some mutual friends of ours have been pointing out, the Volcker mythology that the Fed really controlled inflation is likely more myth than reality.
[01:36:31.358 --> 01:36:44.041]  What if it turns out they're wrong and they're not able to reduce inflation because it turns out you can't put the genie back in the box again after printing all of this money and instead all they really do is blow up the housing market and blow up the stock market?
[01:36:44.201 --> 01:36:53.063]  What is the risk that we face that and what is the risk that we don't face a recession but is there a risk we face actually a depression level economics moving forward?
[01:36:54.679 --> 01:36:56.420]  Yes, there's absolutely a risk of that.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.322]  I think the risk is incredibly high.
[01:36:58.982 --> 01:37:01.084]  And I think it's all a matter of nuance.
[01:37:01.184 --> 01:37:03.105]  I mean, we talk about a housing crash.
[01:37:03.185 --> 01:37:03.946]  Let's start there.
[01:37:04.686 --> 01:37:09.049]  Housing market doesn't usually crash like we think of the stock market.
[01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:13.292]  In other words, the stock market can go down by 20-30% in two or three weeks.
[01:37:16.252 --> 01:37:17.393]  We've seen that many times.
[01:37:17.833 --> 01:37:21.875]  But for the housing market to go down, it usually takes years.
[01:37:22.175 --> 01:37:30.360]  We go back to the GFC, and it peaked out in 2006, and then it bottomed out in 2012 before it started to quote-unquote recover.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:32.521]  So the housing market takes a long time.
[01:37:32.561 --> 01:37:40.205]   Now, if you're asking me, can we see a period over the next year or two where nominal prices Start to come down?
[01:37:40.225 --> 01:37:42.006]  I think absolutely yes.
[01:37:42.066 --> 01:37:47.848]  In fact, today I did a story on how the sales have decreased nationwide by 20%.
[01:37:48.148 --> 01:37:58.911]  Now, it doesn't necessarily mean that prices are coming down, but this could be a leading indicator that would imply that in 2023, there's going to be downward pressure on prices.
[01:37:58.951 --> 01:38:04.213]  And obviously, they can come down in real terms when you're actually adjusting for the rate of inflation.
[01:38:04.273 --> 01:38:11.487]   So if your house goes up by, let's say, 5%, But the inflation is at 10, you're still losing 5% purchasing power.
[01:38:11.507 --> 01:38:13.388]  So, in real terms, it's come down.
[01:38:13.789 --> 01:38:19.713]  Now, moving over to the stock market, we've seen that it's very close, if not in a bear market.
[01:38:19.813 --> 01:38:23.836]  Whether you're looking at the Dow, the S&P, the Nasdaq, the Russell.
[01:38:24.356 --> 01:38:30.781]  And so, to think that we could further this bear market, the answer is absolutely, unequivocally yes.
[01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:40.243]  Especially if the Fed continues this battle with inflation, and if they continue to reduce the size of their balance sheet by doing something called quantitative tightening.
[01:38:40.643 --> 01:38:43.603]  This is basically the opposite of quantitative easing.
[01:38:44.143 --> 01:38:53.165]  And if you set up a chart of the S&P 500, and you layer that over the Fed's balance sheet, there's a very high correlation.
[01:38:53.625 --> 01:38:58.866]  In other words, when the Fed is doing quantitative easing, you see the stock market S&P going up.
[01:38:59.739 --> 01:39:04.963]  When the Fed is doing quantitative tightening, then you see the stock market flattening out and going down.
[01:39:05.343 --> 01:39:11.868]  The Fed just started their QT, or their tightening process, in June of this year.
[01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:25.077]  So, while the Fed is raising interest rates, while they're doing quantitative tightening, while we could be, or what the yield curve is telling us, we could not only be facing a recession, but a significant, a deep, prolonged recession.
[01:39:25.497 --> 01:39:31.101]   I think the probability is very high The stock market comes down in nominal terms as well.
[01:39:31.382 --> 01:39:34.584]  So then the question, Robert, becomes what happens to purchasing power?
[01:39:35.084 --> 01:39:45.231]  And I'm someone that believes the US economy is heavily dependent on asset prices or the purchasing power of average Americans in aggregate total.
[01:39:45.311 --> 01:39:51.815]  So what I mean by that is you can imagine if the stock market came down by 50% from where it is today.
[01:39:52.055 --> 01:39:57.559]  And let's just assume for a moment that we could wave a magic wand and the housing market did the exact same thing.
[01:39:57.418 --> 01:40:01.578]  thing and it did so within the span of six months.
[01:40:01.578 --> 01:40:05.898]   And let's just say that over the next three or four or five years it doesn't
[01:40:05.898 --> 01:40:11.818]   recover. We go into a Japan type scenario in 1990 where the asset prices went down
[01:40:11.818 --> 01:40:17.457]   by call it 50-60 percent and they literally didn't recover for over a
[01:40:17.457 --> 01:40:22.818]   decade even in nominal terms. So think what that would do to the US economy and
[01:40:22.818 --> 01:40:27.338]   the average consumer. When you think about what a healthy economy entails
[01:40:27.338 --> 01:40:33.818]  it's really when you are producing more than you consume.
[01:40:32.713 --> 01:40:49.081]  And think about the level of consumption that we as Americans have had in excess of what we consume due to stimulus checks and due to the fact that these asset prices have been in a bubble and that bubble continues to get larger and larger and larger and larger.
[01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:55.818]   I just read a statistic the other day on CNBC that the average millennial's net worth
[01:40:55.818 --> 01:41:00.817]  has increased by 100% over the last two or three years.
[01:41:00.817 --> 01:41:06.377]   And so, not to poke fun at the millennials, but I thought, okay, well is that because
[01:41:06.377 --> 01:41:11.698]   their STEMI checks increased their checking balance from $500 to $1,000.
[01:41:11.698 --> 01:41:13.198]  (laughing)
[01:41:13.198 --> 01:41:14.658]  But it turns out, no, no, no.
[01:41:14.658 --> 01:41:20.497]   It was about, their average net worth went up to something like 100 or $120,000.
[01:41:20.497 --> 01:41:26.858]   And this is a direct result of the fact that housing went up by such a significant degree.
[01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:36.977]  So you think about what that has done to the overall purchasing power for the United States or consumers in aggregate total, what that does to demand.
[01:41:37.037 --> 01:41:42.581]  I think it increased their net worth by something like four or five trillion dollars.
[01:41:43.502 --> 01:41:48.506]  So you're adding a lot of purchasing power into the economy that wouldn't otherwise be there.
[01:41:49.167 --> 01:42:12.442]  So now let's back up to what we were saying earlier, and if we see the housing market start to go down in nominal terms, even if it's not an outright crash, let's say it starts to go down by 10-15% per year, that's not even including the rate of inflation, and you get the stock market coming down as well, and because we're going into recession, you see unemployment start to go up, so we go from a labor shortage to a labor surplus.
[01:42:13.163 --> 01:42:17.986]  This could really, really impact the average consumer.
[01:42:18.447 --> 01:42:29.194]  And as the United States economy is 70% consumption, that could put us into a tailspin, kind of a feedback loop, where a recession causes asset prices to go down.
[01:42:29.234 --> 01:42:36.980]  Those asset prices going down decreases purchasing power, which puts us further or deepens the actual recession itself.
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.922]  And then we go right back into this cycle.
[01:42:40.473 --> 01:42:43.759]  So these are my concerns right now for the U.S.
[01:42:43.799 --> 01:42:44.259]  economy.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.844]  There are no certainties, there are only probabilities.
[01:42:47.385 --> 01:43:05.060]   But if you look at the euro-dollar future curve, which I'm happy to talk about, or if you look at the treasury curve, this, and this is the smart money by the way, This is predicting that we'll not only have a recession, but we'll have an extreme recession, something similar to potentially what we saw during the GFC.
[01:43:05.260 --> 01:43:13.428]  Now, it's not going to be the same type of crisis, because you rarely have the same type of crisis within like a 50-year time frame.
[01:43:13.769 --> 01:43:20.275]  But the net result, what the yield curves, that's what they're predicting, is that net result will be the same.
[01:43:21.085 --> 01:43:29.531]  And for one of the key organizations that's at the centerpiece of a lot of these policies that have caused a lot of these problems is the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:29.911 --> 01:43:31.792]  You've decided to take on the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:31.832 --> 01:43:39.657]  We've been part of a one-year-long project trying to get them to disclose their secret books, their secret files, all the information that led to their governing decisions.
[01:43:39.677 --> 01:43:44.881]  They've been playing games, so it looks like we're going to have to file suit, and our right to file suit is coming very soon.
[01:43:45.541 --> 01:43:49.524]  What inspired you to take on the Federal Reserve to get this information out to the people?
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:55.601]  Well, a personal story, it was just a dinner that you and I had in Las Vegas.
[01:43:56.622 --> 01:44:04.864]  We were enjoying a nice steak dinner with some good whiskey, and we were talking about what the Federal Reserve did in 2020, specifically.
[01:44:04.904 --> 01:44:06.144]  My memory serves me right, Robert.
[01:44:06.925 --> 01:44:20.454]   And this had me very concerned, because you look at the Federal Reserve Act, and this is basically like the Constitution for the Federal Reserve, meaning that it's meant to constrain The Central Planners.
[01:44:21.235 --> 01:44:27.278]  And you and I always talk about how it's important that we remain a country of law and not of men.
[01:44:28.038 --> 01:44:35.421]  And you look at these special purpose vehicles that the Fed set up during March of 2020 to buy corporate debt, as an example.
[01:44:35.902 --> 01:44:38.883]  And this is, they can't do that.
[01:44:39.803 --> 01:44:43.145]  It might not technically be in there, but you'd know the legal terms.
[01:44:43.185 --> 01:44:51.308]   If you want to follow the spirit of the law, I mean, it's not even close to within their legal rights as to what they can do.
[01:44:51.328 --> 01:44:52.869]  So we had this conversation.
[01:44:52.909 --> 01:44:54.990]  I said, well, we got to hold their feet to the fire.
[01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:56.030]  How do we do this?
[01:44:56.410 --> 01:45:03.873]  Is there a way that we can do a FOIA request to see what they did and then expose that to the public and maybe take it further if we need to?
[01:45:03.893 --> 01:45:05.814]  And you said, yes, there absolutely is a way.
[01:45:06.194 --> 01:45:07.635]  And that's what got us to where we are today.
[01:45:08.095 --> 01:45:08.456]  Exactly.
[01:45:08.776 --> 01:45:09.357]  Thanks, George.
[01:45:09.818 --> 01:45:13.544]  Everybody can find George at George Gammon on YouTube and Rebel Capitalist Pro.
[01:45:13.685 --> 01:45:33.285]   That's where you should go to get the inside information you need to make the best decisions.
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:40.383]  Instead, they obediently learned the new rules and rationalized their submission as a necessary evil.
[01:45:41.183 --> 01:45:48.026]  As a result, things have only gotten worse for everyone, and without any recourse, they are about to get much worse.
[01:45:48.966 --> 01:45:58.929]  Alex Jones is now patient zero for America's new de facto justice system, brought to you by the fear, complacency, and inaction of the people.
[01:45:59.350 --> 01:46:03.251]  Because we take it, here's how we can all expect to now be treated.
[01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:20.377]  Even though Jones never mentioned their name and the parents never sought a retraction, Alex Jones is being sued for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress by parents of children who were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
[01:46:20.997 --> 01:46:33.988]  The rest of the plaintiffs are federal agents, and the legal team is comprised of highly politicized members of the anti-gun lobby, who have admitted their intention is to silence Alex Jones.
[01:46:34.789 --> 01:46:46.677]   So with this new precedent, if you dare question the official narrative, say for example, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, Then someone can sue you into oblivion for emotional distress.
[01:46:47.238 --> 01:46:48.298]  But it only gets worse.
[01:46:48.938 --> 01:46:57.643]  The plaintiffs claim that Alex Jones was the perpetrator of the Sandy Hook crisis actor conspiracy theory, which is demonstrably false.
[01:46:58.143 --> 01:47:10.490]  After all the censorship and deleted videos, one can still find hours and hours of video content compiled from hundreds of sources, all questioning the official narrative of Sandy Hook.
[01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:16.374]  It was arguably the most discussed conspiracy theory since 9-11.
[01:47:17.055 --> 01:47:22.579]  And over the course of seven years, Alex Jones spent less than 30 minutes discussing it.
[01:47:23.159 --> 01:47:26.102]  We know this because it's all part of the public record.
[01:47:26.462 --> 01:47:29.704]  But these radical judges do not care about evidence.
[01:47:30.005 --> 01:47:34.028]  I am not currently representing Alex Jones, so I am free to speak my mind.
[01:47:34.988 --> 01:47:42.130]  They're already, apparently I've heard, that the plaintiff's lawyers are complaining about me speaking out about the case.
[01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:44.891]  That's how corrupt these plaintiff's lawyers are.
[01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:51.973]  They're political hacks standing on the bodies of dead kids to line their pockets and take away other people's political rights.
[01:47:52.293 --> 01:47:54.274]  And I find it disgusting what they've done.
[01:47:54.294 --> 01:47:59.557]   And so, but in this particular context, Jones has produced more discovery than anybody.
[01:47:59.777 --> 01:48:03.580]  I can't find anyone that's produced more discovery than he is and yet they pretended that he didn't.
[01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:04.261]  Why?
[01:48:04.921 --> 01:48:07.623]  Because they built their whole case on a big lie.
[01:48:07.984 --> 01:48:18.272]  Both Judge Gamble in Texas and Judge Bellis in Connecticut have found Alex Jones guilty without ever holding a trial or hearing any evidence.
[01:48:18.672 --> 01:48:25.560]  Which is worse treatment than anyone has ever gotten in America, including Charles Manson and Al Capone.
[01:48:26.141 --> 01:48:35.772]  And their excuse for this abomination of justice is they claim that Jones failed to provide them with the incriminating evidence that they imagine must exist.
[01:48:36.492 --> 01:48:44.078]  Whatever that mysterious, unspecified evidence is, both judges have stripped Jones of his First Amendment right.
[01:48:44.518 --> 01:48:46.960]  But Judge Gamble has gone much further.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:55.166]  Judge Maya Gamble comes from CPS, who has been exposed for human trafficking and working with pedophiles.
[01:48:55.686 --> 01:49:07.051]  Gamble helped publish CPS propaganda praising the state's authority and advising parents that it's normal for their children to lie about being abused in foster care.
[01:49:07.832 --> 01:49:19.277]  In the Alex Jones case, Judge Gamble has ordered that the words First Amendment and free speech cannot be used by Alex Jones, his witnesses, or even his lawyers.
[01:49:19.997 --> 01:49:21.938]  He is not allowed to defend himself.
[01:49:22.678 --> 01:49:30.901]  Judge Gamble has instructed that the jury is not allowed to hear about the emotional trauma caused by the mass murderer who killed the children.
[01:49:31.582 --> 01:49:36.703]  They are only allowed to hear how their trauma was caused by the words of Alex Jones.
[01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:45.467]  And during jury selection, not a single juror thought the media has ever treated Alex Jones or InfoWars unfairly.
[01:49:46.388 --> 01:49:53.587]  And any juror who questioned the $100 million amount casually discussed by the plaintiff's lawyers were kicked off the jury.
[01:49:54.797 --> 01:50:02.683]  Alex Jones was cancelled from social media in 2018 and is now being cancelled from the US Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:50:03.464 --> 01:50:06.686]  And because of our complacency, everyone else is next.
[01:50:07.427 --> 01:50:13.932]  And in case you were wondering, the way we used to do justice was a thing called innocent until proven guilty.
[01:50:14.612 --> 01:50:18.155]  It relied upon the burden of proof and it was pretty good.
[01:50:19.436 --> 01:50:21.958]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:50:26.496 --> 01:50:29.439]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes hosting.
[01:50:30.040 --> 01:50:35.885]  Today, Alex Berenson went on Twitter and said anybody who defends Alex Jones, he's going to block.
[01:50:36.326 --> 01:50:46.296]  This is the grifter and liar and fraud Alex Berenson, who raised money to support his suit against Twitter, promising he would never settle until and unless he got discovery.
[01:50:46.576 --> 01:50:47.317]  And then what did he do?
[01:50:47.737 --> 01:50:50.318]  He's settled without getting publicly disclosed discovery.
[01:50:50.558 --> 01:50:52.319]  Because he's a liar and a fraud.
[01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:56.861]  This is a guy who repeats every war-whore, war-mongering pitch he's ever heard.
[01:50:57.201 --> 01:50:59.402]  This is a guy who lied about Robert Malone.
[01:50:59.502 --> 01:51:02.064]  This is a guy who attacked anybody who supported Ivermectin.
[01:51:02.424 --> 01:51:06.986]  Just because he got one or two things right doesn't mean he's generally a reliable source.
[01:51:07.086 --> 01:51:10.667]  Generally, he is a lot less reliable than Alex Jones has been.
[01:51:10.988 --> 01:51:33.656]   And if he's going to go around attacking people for defending Alex Jones' right to due process of law, Right to trial by jury, a right established at the foundation of our country, he should at least try to get a few things right for a guy who's been too busy grifting and defrauding his own customer base to support a suit that he didn't push like he said and promised he would as the condition for raising that money.
[01:51:34.196 --> 01:51:40.599]  So, indeed, people with logs in their eyes shouldn't be going around trying to spot the specks in other people's eyes.
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.460]  But this is part of a pattern.
[01:51:42.921 --> 01:51:51.325]  The judge in the Sandy Hook case, here in Austin, Texas, concerning Alex Jones, I would love to show you what she said to the jury.
[01:51:51.865 --> 01:51:53.086]  But she's not allowing that!
[01:51:53.706 --> 01:52:02.131]  Only the media outlets that she chooses are allowed to republish or rebroadcast any aspect of a trial that the public has a right to access.
[01:52:02.631 --> 01:52:08.772]  So while that judge is depriving people of their constitutional right to publicly access the trial, what does she have to hide?
[01:52:09.172 --> 01:52:15.274]  Well, maybe her own prior history as a lawyer involved with Child Protective Services and all that entails.
[01:52:15.834 --> 01:52:17.974]  So, or what's happening in the courtroom?
[01:52:18.134 --> 01:52:26.076]  Why is this judge scared for the world to see what is happening in the courtroom unless she controls the broadcast and publication of it?
[01:52:26.656 --> 01:52:29.197]  Maybe because of what she actually did the other day.
[01:52:29.777 --> 01:52:43.423]  So, as part of Alex Jones' defense, the defense lawyer got up and said that Alex Jones had repeatedly, profusely, quite on his knees to the world, effectively, apologized.
[01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:49.606]  Again, and again, and again, and again, for anything and everything he got wrong in the Sandy Hook context.
[01:52:50.106 --> 01:52:56.488]  Do you remember the New York Times apologizing for getting us involved in war after war after war after war after war?
[01:52:56.768 --> 01:53:03.250]  Do you remember CNN apologizing for anything that they've done that's led to the deaths of tens of millions of people around the globe?
[01:53:03.851 --> 01:53:04.031]  No.
[01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:06.471]  Alex Jones didn't cause any deaths at all.
[01:53:06.972 --> 01:53:14.014]  All he got wrong was a few items and he publicly admitted to that on a public confessional, on a public confessional tour.
[01:53:14.634 --> 01:53:17.857]  So, why does the judge not want the jury to hear that information?
[01:53:18.277 --> 01:53:30.248]  Well, what the judge did is the judge not only struck that from the record, the judge told the jury that Texas law, under defamation law, doesn't allow an apology to be used for mitigation of damages.
[01:53:30.908 --> 01:53:36.130]  Well that's kind of odd because Texas law says the exact opposite of what the judge said.
[01:53:36.491 --> 01:53:45.175]  What Texas law specifically states is that indeed an apology can be admissible evidence that should be admitted into court to mitigate it.
[01:53:45.555 --> 01:54:04.881]   This is part of the railroading of Alex Jones, the weaponized lawfare that involves the denial of due process and the denial of a right to trial by jury that should concern all Americans Especially someone like Alex Berenson, who should be more worried about refunding the donors he scammed than attacking Alex Jones supporters in the court of public opinion.
[01:54:06.622 --> 01:54:07.202]  We are back!
[01:54:07.502 --> 01:54:09.962]  This is the Alex Jones Show, Robert Barnes hosting.
[01:54:10.822 --> 01:54:17.644]  In this segment, we will be discussing with Richard Barris what the polling and public opinion data really shows.
[01:54:18.464 --> 01:54:26.469]   Later on, we will be discussing whether or not, as a Hail Mary, Biden plans to indict Donald Trump anytime soon.
[01:54:27.029 --> 01:54:28.410]  But first, with Richard Barris.
[01:54:28.811 --> 01:54:31.493]  You can find Richard Barris at People's Pundit Daily.
[01:54:31.513 --> 01:54:34.616]  You can find him at peoplespundit.locals.com.
[01:54:34.636 --> 01:54:44.165]  You can find People's Pundit on Rumble and, while it still lasts, on YouTube and some other platforms until they finally completely and utterly remove him for speaking truth to power.
[01:54:44.685 --> 01:54:52.428]  Richard Barras has been the most accurate pollster consistently for elections going on the better part of a decade since he's entered the business.
[01:54:52.968 --> 01:55:02.672]  And for that reason has been attacked and defamed by many of the institutional gatekeepers concerning public opinion because they often don't want you to know what real public opinion holds.
[01:55:03.413 --> 01:55:23.735]  Richard was ahead of the curve predicting consistently the collapsing approval ratings of Joe Biden weeks or sometimes months before the institutional media would confess the same and has been consistently accurate calling a wide range of elections for a long period of time consistently the most accurate election after election, year after year, cycle after cycle.
[01:55:24.255 --> 01:55:37.906]  So that's why we're here to discuss with Richard what's coming up for November, what's coming up in August in Arizona in the Senate primaries, and what the real political opinions are on issues like abortion and free speech and Alex Jones.
[01:55:38.847 --> 01:55:39.928]  Richard, glad you could make it!
[01:55:41.445 --> 01:55:42.727]  Hey, thanks for having me, Robert.
[01:55:42.807 --> 01:55:44.689]  It's good to be here with you, my friend, as always.
[01:55:45.049 --> 01:55:45.590]  Absolutely.
[01:55:46.031 --> 01:55:57.044]  So, in terms of the politics of abortion as an example, there's been a lot of institutional complaints or statements that, hey, you know, the Republicans are really going to get hit, they're really going to get hurt.
[01:55:57.404 --> 01:56:00.347]  Because of Roe v. Wade's reversal and sending it back to the states.
[01:56:00.728 --> 01:56:02.590]  The American people all love abortion.
[01:56:02.630 --> 01:56:06.214]  They want abortion to be as long and as often and as frequent as possible.
[01:56:07.716 --> 01:56:14.984]  That's where the public consensus is and that there'll be this mass turnout of young Democrats enraged at the denial of their rights to an abortion.
[01:56:15.564 --> 01:56:17.727]  Is that in fact what the American people believe?
[01:56:19.488 --> 01:56:21.570]  Yeah, that's like a 30-year-old argument, Robert.
[01:56:22.030 --> 01:56:37.923]  You know, the problem with, and Republicans should understand this, and they'd be able to fight back and use abortion to their advantage, but the truth is that's the same argument, you know, they constructed this box in the 1990s for us to all have this debate in, but the truth is abortion voters aren't young anymore, Robert.
[01:56:38.243 --> 01:56:39.043]  They're not young.
[01:56:39.103 --> 01:56:44.445]  The 1990 youth voter is now like me, a 40-year-old middle-aged voter.
[01:56:45.345 --> 01:56:48.026]  These are what we're calling the news cycle Democrats.
[01:56:48.106 --> 01:56:53.627]  It does, you know, tend to influence, you know, their views on what's their most important issue.
[01:56:53.647 --> 01:56:55.828]  It really changes with the news cycle.
[01:56:55.948 --> 01:56:58.149]  Abortion is the latest one, but two months ago.
[01:56:58.449 --> 01:56:59.749]  It would have been the war in Ukraine.
[01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:02.691]  They would have changed their mind and would have told you it was the war in Ukraine.
[01:57:03.032 --> 01:57:07.135]  A week before the Roe v. Wade decision, it would have been gun safety.
[01:57:07.255 --> 01:57:09.878]  So, you know, these voters vote anyway.
[01:57:09.958 --> 01:57:10.819]  That's the truth of it.
[01:57:11.379 --> 01:57:12.981]  They hold post-grad degrees.
[01:57:13.021 --> 01:57:16.644]  They're typically the overly educated, as we refer to them.
[01:57:16.984 --> 01:57:18.826]  They're going to vote anyway.
[01:57:18.946 --> 01:57:25.451]  So younger voters don't really think about this stuff the way we did in the 80s and the 90s, especially in the 90s.
[01:57:26.152 --> 01:57:32.036]  You know, when the pro-choice designation had massive double-digit leads, that's just not the case anymore.
[01:57:32.076 --> 01:57:35.579]  Month-to-month, pro-life and pro-choice are pretty much split.
[01:57:35.899 --> 01:57:40.983]  And aside from Gallup, I would put our record, you know, second to nobody.
[01:57:41.423 --> 01:57:43.905]  They just, Gallup has a longer track record of doing this.
[01:57:44.225 --> 01:57:52.271]  But we've been pulling this issue in-depth for a very long time, and views on abortion are much more complicated than the media, you know, wants to portray them.
[01:57:52.791 --> 01:58:06.674]  And is it in fact the case that a majority of Americans in pretty much every state favor relimiting abortion until once a baby has a heartbeat and there's brain activity and it's past 12 weeks?
[01:58:07.274 --> 01:58:16.276]  Is there majority support for an abortion at that point, after the 12 week time period, after a heartbeat, after brain development has taken place in America?
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:19.041]  Yeah, not at all.
[01:58:19.401 --> 01:58:26.446]  So the more, obviously, different stages, opposition to abortion grows as you get through different stages, the different trimesters.
[01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:31.589]  But with the advent of the heartbeat bill, for instance, in Texas, we started saying that, using that term.
[01:58:31.949 --> 01:58:36.512]  Once a baby, once a heartbeat is able to be detected.
[01:58:36.792 --> 01:58:44.737]  You know, what's interesting about that, and people can go see this on our locals page, they can go find this polling, we'll show you the difference between pro-life and pro-choice voters.
[01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:47.458]   When somebody tells you they're pro-life, They're pro-life.
[01:58:47.899 --> 01:58:57.804]  And when you ask them whether they support or oppose abortion in different varying stages of the pregnancy, their views are much more consistent than somebody who tells you that they're pro-choice.
[01:58:58.224 --> 01:59:10.075]   Somebody can tell you they're pro-choice, and then when you ask them whether they support abortion, After a heartbeat has been detected, they're going to lose about a third of that pro-choice vote right at that period where the heartbeat has been detected.
[01:59:10.095 --> 01:59:13.780]  When you get into the second trimester, they start to lose near majority.
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:18.886]  When you get into the third, then they start to lose almost super majorities of their own vote.
[01:59:19.546 --> 01:59:25.952]  So, you know, the truth is science has not been kind to the abortion industry over the last two, three decades.
[01:59:26.332 --> 01:59:27.994]  And people's views on abortion change.
[01:59:28.014 --> 01:59:28.895]  They want it limited.
[01:59:29.415 --> 01:59:33.899]  Even people will tell you they're pro-choice and tell you that it shouldn't be outlawed completely.
[01:59:34.240 --> 01:59:37.783]  What they mean, Robert, is within weeks, like soon.
[01:59:38.223 --> 01:59:40.965]  A Biden voter in Austin, or Dallas, excuse me.
[01:59:41.406 --> 01:59:49.492]  A Biden voter in Dallas, a female, who was, middle age is a pretty good way to explain her, to describe her.
[01:59:50.092 --> 01:59:54.175]  She told us that she still opposed abortion after a heartbeat had been detected.
[01:59:54.295 --> 02:00:01.301]  And when we asked her about it, she said something I've never heard before, but it really, it was, it's going to stick with me because it was profound.
[02:00:01.821 --> 02:00:12.428]  And she said, you know, when we think about it, when we think about, you know, people dying, you're about to enter the death state, and life is over, when the heartbeat stops beating, we associate that with death, right?
[02:00:12.448 --> 02:00:15.991]  Because you're not going to have brain activity after your heart, you know, stops beating.
[02:00:16.371 --> 02:00:24.557]  Just as we think about it with death, you know, then the point that the heart starts beating is why I think of it as the beginning of life.
[02:00:24.697 --> 02:00:29.080]  And, you know, all these years polling, I had not had it explained to me like that.
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:35.802]  But that is a supposedly pro-choice woman in a Dallas suburb who voted for Joe Biden.
[02:00:36.342 --> 02:00:41.724]  So she's very indicative of how the modern American voter looks at this issue.
[02:00:42.124 --> 02:00:43.624]  And can you also describe on guns?
[02:00:43.744 --> 02:00:46.385]  Because there's been discussion that the Second Amendment decision of the U.S.
[02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:50.706]  Supreme Court and its ramifications will have this massive political backlash across the country.
[02:00:51.366 --> 02:00:56.868]  Is the Second Amendment a net political winner for Republicans in November?
[02:00:58.405 --> 02:01:05.527]  Yeah, there's only downside risk if you get on board with pushing any kind of gun control measure if you're on the right.
[02:01:05.867 --> 02:01:18.270]  The reason is, all that you can do, you're not going to win the middle of the road voter who is responsible for the temporary rise in polling when an event happens and people start polling and ask about stricter gun control laws.
[02:01:18.590 --> 02:01:21.913]  There's always a temporary increase in people that will say, yes, I support that.
[02:01:22.294 --> 02:01:24.436]  Those people don't vote based on guns.
[02:01:24.476 --> 02:01:28.699]  The only people who vote on gun issues are pro-Second Amendment voters.
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:32.523]  And all you'll do is discourage them from voting or tick them off.
[02:01:32.863 --> 02:01:40.350]  If you look at a race like Michigan 3, where we polled out there for the, there's John Gibbs going against the incumbent Peter Mayer, right?
[02:01:41.691 --> 02:01:44.154]  Mayer, the department store guy.
[02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:48.572]  There were people who weren't angry that his first vote was to impeach Donald Trump.
[02:01:48.612 --> 02:01:51.234]  Maybe they didn't like it, but that wasn't a deal breaker for them.
[02:01:51.594 --> 02:01:53.735]  They weren't happy about the January 6th committee.
[02:01:53.776 --> 02:01:58.979]  They don't like it, but that's not, again, what did it for them when we were polling is when he cast that gun vote.
[02:01:59.339 --> 02:02:01.000]  And that's when the bottom fell out from Peter.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:05.885]  So it's a perfect example of all you can do is put yourself at risk.
[02:02:05.945 --> 02:02:10.029]  You can either discourage your voters, but you're not going to win anybody else over.
[02:02:10.090 --> 02:02:12.552]  Those people in the middle, they're going to vote on inflation.
[02:02:12.572 --> 02:02:13.854]  They're going to vote on the economy.
[02:02:13.874 --> 02:02:15.115]  They're going to vote on something else.
[02:02:15.455 --> 02:02:17.838]  And guns, it's just not their priority, Robert.
[02:02:21.777 --> 02:02:29.979]  The little secret of abortion voting, the little secret of Second Amendment voting, is that it is a net winner for the pro-life community.
[02:02:30.399 --> 02:02:33.700]  It is a net winner for the pro-Second Amendment community.
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:40.123]   When we come back after the break with Richard, we'll discuss Who is going to win the Arizona Republican primary?
[02:02:40.463 --> 02:02:42.344]  Who is going to prevail in November?
[02:02:42.664 --> 02:02:45.026]  Democrats are saying maybe it's close and competitive.
[02:02:45.186 --> 02:02:45.786]  Is it really?
[02:02:46.186 --> 02:02:49.688]  What would a Trump DeSantis ticket look like in 2024?
[02:02:50.709 --> 02:02:54.651]  And where is there any practical alternative to Joe Biden?
[02:02:55.011 --> 02:03:01.855]  Or are the Democrats going to have to play weekend at Bernie's for two more years with just weekend at Biden's instead?
[02:03:02.355 --> 02:03:05.037]  Now remember everybody, you are the front line.
[02:03:05.397 --> 02:03:09.340]  And if you hold the line, you will keep InfoWars alive and afloat.
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:15.864]  You will make sure independent information continues to be accessible and available to you and those you care about.
[02:03:16.184 --> 02:03:23.269]  And you can do so by making yourself healthier, wealthier and wiser by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:03:23.549 --> 02:03:28.592]  We'll be back right after the break with Richard to break down what November elections will look like.
[02:03:30.253 --> 02:03:30.994]  It is surreal.
[02:03:32.239 --> 02:03:34.280]  to actually be living inside the New World Order.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:42.763]  It is bizarre to read all their white papers and battle plans from 50, 60, 70 years ago and now to see it all being implemented.
[02:03:43.824 --> 02:03:50.987]  What's truly horrifying is we know what their battle plans call for in the next phase, a 90% foresty population of the planet.
[02:03:51.907 --> 02:04:00.411]  They have recruited an army of control freaks and pedophiles and scum and criminals of every sort to build their New World Order army.
[02:04:01.562 --> 02:04:05.765]  They have the big private central banks, and they're funding, they have the corporate media, they have most of the courts.
[02:04:05.805 --> 02:04:08.746]  But they don't have our hearts, our minds.
[02:04:09.267 --> 02:04:10.788]  And they don't have control of your soul.
[02:04:12.285 --> 02:04:18.628]  If we simply realize that God is the answer and reach out to God to give us discernment, to lead God and direct us, we are unstoppable together.
[02:04:18.648 --> 02:04:22.070]  Now, InfoWars is under unprecedented globalist attack.
[02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:25.032]  I'm quite frankly proud of it, even though it's very daunting.
[02:04:25.252 --> 02:04:28.394]  But I know I have the living God inside my soul.
[02:04:28.414 --> 02:04:31.635]  I have the power of the overcomer inside of me, and so do you.
[02:04:31.655 --> 02:04:32.416]  We're going to win this.
[02:04:33.536 --> 02:04:43.851]  If we just continue to resist the tyrants, not because we hate these evil people, but because we love our children and we love the innocents that are counting on us to stand up and speak out and fight back.
[02:04:44.152 --> 02:04:45.634]  Now, the cavalry's here.
[02:04:45.714 --> 02:04:47.476]  So many of our best-selling products have been sold out.
[02:04:47.997 --> 02:04:49.559]  They've all come back in the last few weeks.
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:52.982]  And it's bringing in funding that was absolutely essential at this point.
[02:04:53.362 --> 02:04:54.262]  So it's a 360 win.

[02:05:26.731 --> 02:05:27.731]  God bless.
[02:05:27.731 --> 02:05:34.570]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:34.911 --> 02:05:36.993]  Guest host today, Robert Barnes.
[02:05:37.153 --> 02:05:39.616]  We're here with Richard Barris, People's Pundit.
[02:05:39.756 --> 02:05:44.421]  You can find him at People's Pundit Daily, People's Pundit on Twitter, while he's still allowed to be there.
[02:05:45.042 --> 02:05:47.345]  People's Pundit on YouTube and Rumble.
[02:05:47.865 --> 02:06:00.911]  And at peoplespundit.locals.com where you can get all of his data, including inside information before anybody else gets it, from the most accurate public opinion pollster for the better part of a decade.
[02:06:00.931 --> 02:06:02.472]  In fact, that's how I found him.
[02:06:02.692 --> 02:06:12.117]  I was looking for an accurate pollster, finding somebody who had predicted things before they happened rather than tried to claim they did so after it happened, and Richard was the one on top of all of it.
[02:06:12.757 --> 02:06:27.945]  Richard, in terms of public opinion on Alex Jones, and you've seen some of those public opinions, and from my review of it, a truly impartial jury would, on average, not award $75 million per person in damages.
[02:06:28.446 --> 02:06:32.248]  Indeed, the average jury verdict would be less than six figures.
[02:06:32.708 --> 02:06:37.573]  With an impartial jury selected that had no preconceived bias going in.
[02:06:38.053 --> 02:06:48.323]  How much of the Republican base is closer to the opinions held by the Alex Jones audience compared to say Mitt Romney, Lindsey Graham and some of that crap?
[02:06:50.663 --> 02:06:51.443]  You know, that's funny.
[02:06:52.224 --> 02:06:55.145]  It'll get worse as time goes on.
[02:06:55.246 --> 02:06:58.207]  Arizona is actually a really good state to illustrate that.
[02:06:58.227 --> 02:07:04.751]  I mean, the Republican, the average Republican voter is not really represented at all by the people that are in Washington.
[02:07:04.791 --> 02:07:06.813]  That's a shrinking share of the electorate.
[02:07:07.373 --> 02:07:12.676]  And, you know, you know this because we've actually taken a look at people's audiences, Robert, you know that.
[02:07:13.537 --> 02:07:20.922]   And people that are more aligned with people like Alex and some of the other personalities out there, They have the younger, more diverse crowds.
[02:07:20.982 --> 02:07:25.506]  They have the future of the party, of what the Republican party is going to be.
[02:07:25.586 --> 02:07:30.731]  So, you know, looking at next week, there'll be a ton of races that are really illustrating this fight.
[02:07:31.592 --> 02:07:36.156]  They're, you know, the old GOP, the old establishment, and they're gasping.
[02:07:36.355 --> 02:07:38.996]  with their last dying breath. I mean, they really are.
[02:07:38.996 --> 02:07:41.956]  Their coalition is exceedingly older.
[02:07:41.956 --> 02:07:44.595]  They're literally, I mean, there's no lack of a better word.
[02:07:44.595 --> 02:07:50.704]   They're literally, you know, being being phased out. They're a dying breed. And that's it. And
[02:07:50.704 --> 02:07:55.615]   as an example, what do you think will happen in the Arizona Republican primary where you
[02:07:55.615 --> 02:08:02.365]   have the populist candidate, Blake Masters, running on a lot of populist causes, campaigning in a populist
[02:08:02.365 --> 02:08:07.615]   manner, opposed, getting further involved in the Ukrainian conflict with no-fly zones and $40
[02:08:07.615 --> 02:08:11.394]   billion bailouts for deep state funds, et cetera?
[02:08:11.537 --> 02:08:16.481]  Will he prevail in the Republican primary, do you believe, in the Arizona primary coming up next week?
[02:08:17.839 --> 02:08:19.621]  Yeah, because this was your idea.
[02:08:19.661 --> 02:08:20.722]  I gotta give you credit for this.
[02:08:21.142 --> 02:08:22.123]  This was Robert's idea.
[02:08:22.143 --> 02:08:27.649]  In states like Arizona, Texas, go check out the CD Media Big Data Poll that we did in Arizona.
[02:08:27.689 --> 02:08:29.030]  It's on CDM.press.
[02:08:29.450 --> 02:08:30.752]  Look at a few things.
[02:08:31.012 --> 02:08:32.754]  Age, race, and generation.
[02:08:32.834 --> 02:08:40.860]   When you look at that primary vote, And you'll see that both Blake Masters and Kerry Lake are winning the newer, more dynamic, diverse coalition.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:45.723]  We had Masters up by about 11 and Lake up by around 14.
[02:08:46.344 --> 02:08:53.249]  But honestly, this is why you're seeing statements from others like Data Orbital out there basically saying, you know, the governor's race is over.
[02:08:53.909 --> 02:08:59.073]  They're seeing what we saw, which was as those people decided, we had 20% undecided.
[02:08:59.153 --> 02:09:02.636]  Now it fell to 11 on the last days of interviewing.
[02:09:03.278 --> 02:09:08.172]  Blake Masters was actually doing about five points better than the overall lead in the published poll.
[02:09:08.954 --> 02:09:09.374]  On C.D.
[02:09:09.414 --> 02:09:12.756]  Media right now, Kerry Lake was also similarly doing about five points better.
[02:09:13.016 --> 02:09:19.178]  That final day of interview, Robert, when people decided, that's when they both started to run away with it.
[02:09:19.359 --> 02:09:23.740]  I think at this point, Masters and Lake are, you know, good luck catching them.
[02:09:24.141 --> 02:09:34.025]  The only bright light, again, if they're Republican establishment candidates, is that they're doing a little bit better with the older Republican primary voters, and they tend to be more certain to vote.
[02:09:34.305 --> 02:09:36.686]  But the bottom line is, they weren't winning them.
[02:09:37.026 --> 02:09:39.467]  So at this point, Blake Masters was still winning them.
[02:09:39.547 --> 02:09:42.788]  At this point, Kerry Lake is still out of lead with these voters.
[02:09:42.848 --> 02:09:51.550]  So I just see no place where Robeson or LeMond, Jim LeMond, could catch the more populous candidates.
[02:09:51.890 --> 02:09:59.572]  And when you look at polling the way we have over the years, folks, and you start to see those undecideds just evaporate as every day goes on.
[02:10:00.172 --> 02:10:02.873]  And you see certain candidates taking the lion's share.
[02:10:03.493 --> 02:10:04.133]  That's a surge.
[02:10:04.573 --> 02:10:05.534]  I mean, that's what you're looking at.
[02:10:05.574 --> 02:10:06.534]  You're looking at a surge.
[02:10:06.574 --> 02:10:14.736]  And they're coming down to a point where that last day in the governor's race, Robert, the last day of interviews, Kerry Lake was actually just over 50.
[02:10:15.117 --> 02:10:18.137]  Robeson was at about 34 with people deciding.
[02:10:18.578 --> 02:10:24.219]  And then Blake Masters had exceeded 35 percent with Jim Lamon only at 22.
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:26.400]  Brnovich completely collapsed.
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:28.321]  He was at 11 percent on the final day.
[02:10:28.441 --> 02:10:29.641]  So that's a big deal.
[02:10:30.101 --> 02:10:36.206]  And so, what you see on CDN reflects overall over three days of tracking, but you know it when you see it.
[02:10:36.426 --> 02:10:37.126]  Those are surges.
[02:10:37.166 --> 02:10:38.367]  Those two candidates are surging.
[02:10:38.727 --> 02:10:39.068]  Absolutely.
[02:10:39.088 --> 02:10:53.298]  The way I've described it is, if you're a young Republican primary voter, young Republican primary candidate, young Republican volunteer activist, you need to win the Alex Jones voter because the Alex Jones voter is the future of the Republican Party.
[02:10:53.638 --> 02:11:01.144]  Those candidates that have appealed to the Alex Jones voter directly and specifically are going to be the future power base of the Republican Party moving forward.
[02:11:01.543 --> 02:11:07.783]   Now speaking of which, in terms of coming in November, we see the Biden administration now escalating talk
[02:11:07.783 --> 02:11:14.023]   of indicting Donald Trump on completely bogus, fictional charges, but they have a corrupt grand jury
[02:11:14.023 --> 02:11:18.403]   process in the District of Columbia, a corrupt jury pool in the District of Columbia,
[02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:22.983]   as we've witnessed in the Steve Bannon trial, witnessed in other prior trials where Democrats walk
[02:11:22.983 --> 02:11:25.863]  and Republicans get the guillotine.
[02:11:25.863 --> 02:11:31.983]   What do you think, what's gonna happen right now as of November in a Trump-DeSantis 2024 ticket,
[02:11:31.983 --> 02:11:40.423]   and could an indictment of Trump be a Hail Mary that could salvage and save the Democrats come 2022 or 2024?
[02:11:40.423 --> 02:11:45.302]   You know, going into the new year, I remember the holiday season.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:46.701]  Everybody in D.C.
[02:11:46.781 --> 02:11:47.621]  was distraught.
[02:11:48.322 --> 02:11:53.786]  It was like the worst kept secret that basically they were terrified Donald Trump was going to come back.
[02:11:53.846 --> 02:11:55.087]  Everybody had been looking at polling.
[02:11:55.367 --> 02:11:58.829]  You had people like Michael Gershon, former Bush advisor, writing articles.
[02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:00.871]  Trump's coming back stronger than ever.
[02:12:00.891 --> 02:12:04.874]  You know, I've always thought that this was, this is a show, this January 6th committee.
[02:12:05.194 --> 02:12:06.775]  This is a show for the people at home.
[02:12:06.875 --> 02:12:09.157]  Nobody really believes Donald Trump broke any laws.
[02:12:10.238 --> 02:12:15.164]  It's their last attempt to keep Trump away from the White House because they know they can't beat him.
[02:12:15.284 --> 02:12:16.466]  You've seen the polling, Robert.
[02:12:17.226 --> 02:12:20.530]  How many more people off the Democratic bench do we have to add?
[02:12:20.771 --> 02:12:25.216]  We're now adding Gavin Newsom, even though I'm skeptical of his ability to win a Democratic nomination.
[02:12:25.496 --> 02:12:27.138]  You have to win black voters in the South.
[02:12:27.199 --> 02:12:29.061]  I don't see Gavin doing that, but whatever.
[02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:32.442]  Well, add him, because everybody else is getting crushed.
[02:12:32.502 --> 02:12:37.123]  As weak as Joe Biden is, he's still the weakest candidate against Donald Trump.
[02:12:37.604 --> 02:12:39.744]  He comes the closest, but he's still losing.
[02:12:40.364 --> 02:12:42.785]  The rest of them, from Hillary on down.
[02:12:43.625 --> 02:12:44.886]  Bernie is the second strongest.
[02:12:44.906 --> 02:12:48.227]  Bernie Sanders is the second, but he's still down pretty significantly.
[02:12:48.287 --> 02:12:50.688]  A Trump-DeSantis ticket is unbeatable.
[02:12:50.948 --> 02:12:51.788]  I'll say that now.
[02:12:53.068 --> 02:12:54.089]  I really believe that.
[02:12:54.589 --> 02:12:59.651]  And this is somebody who didn't, you know, two years ago, didn't believe the Republicans would ever win the popular vote again.
[02:12:59.671 --> 02:13:04.893]  I think that ticket, probably, the Republican ticket would win that popular vote.
[02:13:05.173 --> 02:13:15.977]  You know, going into this November, with all the talk of distractions, we're in the summer, folks, and there's a serious non-response bias problem with Republicans in the summer.
[02:13:16.417 --> 02:13:20.039]  As we get closer to Labor Day, I think the picture will change a little bit.
[02:13:20.699 --> 02:13:23.662]  All of the indicators are showing a historic route.
[02:13:23.782 --> 02:13:27.946]  Republican leadership is doing everything they can, I think, to keep their win manageable.
[02:13:27.986 --> 02:13:30.007]  They don't want a bunch of MAGA people in Congress.
[02:13:30.248 --> 02:13:32.109]  Then they'll have to explain themselves to them.
[02:13:32.389 --> 02:13:36.613]  They don't want to be in the position John Boehner was in when the Tea Party won, for instance.
[02:13:37.374 --> 02:13:41.257]  It would be even worse with a MAGA, you know, an influx of MAGA freshmen.
[02:13:41.436 --> 02:13:45.315]   and for uh... you know senators and congressman so i think they're trying to
[02:13:45.315 --> 02:13:49.275]   keep it manageable but the bottom line is robert you know the numbers i get
[02:13:49.275 --> 02:13:52.796]   people who watch this for a long time now democrats are in
[02:13:52.796 --> 02:13:58.716]   i guess you know i had a bad territory indeed deep trouble thanks uh... for richard barris you can find a people's
[02:13:58.716 --> 02:14:06.635]   planet thanks everybody for joining
[02:14:06.635 --> 02:14:13.896]   we are now living in the void sliding towards collapse in the strange space between what
[02:14:13.896 --> 02:14:15.555]   we've known and what's to come
[02:14:16.113 --> 02:14:20.917]  And right now, the most important thing to remember is, don't panic.
[02:14:21.378 --> 02:14:28.564]  Stay calm, because now is the time that we must get our bearings and steer the ship onto a safe, sound course.
[02:14:28.904 --> 02:14:32.948]  There is nothing stopping we the people from making our own rules.
[02:14:33.568 --> 02:14:35.390]  And building our own society.
[02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:38.032]  All we got to do is survive the crash.
[02:14:38.432 --> 02:14:41.014]  And right now, we still have time to prepare.
[02:14:41.414 --> 02:14:45.217]  The world fiat currency system is racing towards zero.
[02:14:45.617 --> 02:14:48.439]  It's time to convert it into hard assets now.
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:51.802]  Including food, water, and survival gear.
[02:14:52.002 --> 02:14:53.904]  To keep us strong and at the ready.
[02:14:54.224 --> 02:15:02.103]   Go to preparetoday.com for the essentials, storable foods, water filtration, first aid,
[02:15:02.103 --> 02:15:06.364]  power, and more at preparetoday.com.
[02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:09.304]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:08.972 --> 02:15:12.154]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:15:12.194 --> 02:15:15.255]  I'm so glad to be with you today and I hope you're having a good summer.
[02:15:15.315 --> 02:15:17.577]  When I say that, I know that there's a lot of stress.
[02:15:17.957 --> 02:15:27.281]  I know there's a lot of things that we're all thinking about or watching the country implode and seeing things that are, well, hard to see.
[02:15:28.925 --> 02:15:31.007]  Just know that I always have a lot of hope.
[02:15:31.207 --> 02:15:31.527]  I do.
[02:15:31.547 --> 02:15:32.868]  I have a lot of hope in people.
[02:15:33.248 --> 02:15:39.273]  When you travel the United States, especially if you're doing that this summer, you're going to find that people are good everywhere you go.
[02:15:39.293 --> 02:15:47.319]  When was the last time, when I was on C-SPAN, I said, when was, somebody had said we are a racist country, and I said, how can we be?
[02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:49.501]  How can we be a racist country?
[02:15:50.802 --> 02:15:51.723]  That's not possible.
[02:15:53.004 --> 02:15:57.715]  There might be a few people that are hardcore racists, but it's a hard word, right?
[02:15:58.216 --> 02:16:01.123]  And a strange word because it's so extreme.
[02:16:02.358 --> 02:16:09.581]  And so when you go around and you're traveling this summer, and I hope that you notice this, there's no brawls, you know, happening in the airports.
[02:16:09.621 --> 02:16:10.701]  There's no over color.
[02:16:11.061 --> 02:16:15.063]  There's no, there's nothing, there's nothing going on that they say is going on.
[02:16:15.663 --> 02:16:21.425]  And I just want you to enjoy your summer because we'll look back on these days and say, these are the good old days.
[02:16:21.785 --> 02:16:22.486]  We always will.
[02:16:22.886 --> 02:16:25.927]  And no matter where you are in your life, it'll always be the good old days.
[02:16:26.267 --> 02:16:30.929]  And I hope this summer proves that it's a wonderful holiday for you.
[02:16:31.994 --> 02:16:33.695]  Think about that while you're traveling around.
[02:16:33.795 --> 02:16:39.016]  See the country for who it is and what it is, and identify the fact that we're being lied to a lot.
[02:16:39.616 --> 02:16:47.419]  My very, very special guest I'm bringing on for this hour, and I'm so excited to do this because I just absolutely am one of her biggest fans.
[02:16:47.759 --> 02:16:50.980]  I've had her on my show several times, and I've had her here on InfoWars.
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:53.281]  Dr. Judy Majkovic joins me.
[02:16:53.481 --> 02:17:03.288]   She is my special guest, and from her doctoral thesis, Which changed the treatment of HIV-AIDS, by the way, saving millions of lives, including Magic Johnson.
[02:17:04.209 --> 02:17:07.352]  Her discovery of a new family of human retroviruses.
[02:17:07.833 --> 02:17:15.941]  Dr. Majkovic has always been on the leading edge of science and her investigations questioned the use of animal tissue in medical research.
[02:17:16.222 --> 02:17:17.643]  Rightfully so, think about that.
[02:17:17.963 --> 02:17:20.346]  Why do we have animal tissue in medical research?
[02:17:21.347 --> 02:17:29.815]  And is that unleashing devastating plagues of chronic disease such as autism and chronic fatigue syndrome, all of those kinds of things.
[02:17:30.395 --> 02:17:32.357]  And she saw it at its worst.
[02:17:32.417 --> 02:17:33.919]  She saw science at its worst.
[02:17:34.079 --> 02:17:37.262]  She started her career at the National Cancer Institute in 1988.
[02:17:37.943 --> 02:17:44.349]  She became a scientist, obtained a PhD in biochemistry and molecular biology from George Washington University in 1991.
[02:17:45.874 --> 02:17:50.840]  Also, she accuses Anthony Fauci, rightfully so, head of the U.S.
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:56.686]  National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a prominent member of the White House, right?
[02:17:57.046 --> 02:18:00.971]  They want to always say he's a prominent member of the White House Corona Task Force.
[02:18:02.051 --> 02:18:06.794]  He is responsible for deaths occurring during those early years of HIV.
[02:18:07.134 --> 02:18:09.155]  You'll also remember her from the Plandemic movie.
[02:18:09.195 --> 02:18:13.337]  She gave brilliant testimony to the lies of COVID, and one of the first to speak out.
[02:18:13.457 --> 02:18:17.539]  And also her book, Plague of Corruption, Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science.
[02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:19.961]  Also, well, so many books.
[02:18:20.081 --> 02:18:26.404]  Plague, One Scientist, Intrepid Search for the Truth about Human Retroviruses, and Truth About Masks.
[02:18:26.824 --> 02:18:29.405]  Her amazing books, I could not put them down.
[02:18:29.526 --> 02:18:30.326]  Please get them.
[02:18:30.786 --> 02:18:32.347]  My guest, Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[02:18:32.387 --> 02:18:33.187]  Welcome to the program.
[02:18:33.207 --> 02:18:33.648]  How are you?
[02:18:35.188 --> 02:18:37.229]  Nice to be with you again, Kate.
[02:18:37.550 --> 02:18:42.492]  Importantly, your audio isn't so good for me.
[02:18:42.512 --> 02:18:47.935]  I'm getting a feedback and in case the audience is getting a feedback.
[02:18:48.513 --> 02:18:50.513]  Yeah, it's a little too loud, I think.
[02:18:51.054 --> 02:18:56.235]  And so, secondly, I did not start my career at the National Cancer Institute in 1988.
[02:18:56.375 --> 02:19:08.577]  Interestingly, they've literally rewritten my bio in order to eliminate the kind of work I really did.
[02:19:08.698 --> 02:19:14.959]  Because what's most important is I'm a natural products chemist.
[02:19:16.079 --> 02:19:17.820]  Out of the University of Virginia.
[02:19:18.460 --> 02:19:22.862]  And they didn't have a degree in biochemistry.
[02:19:22.902 --> 02:19:25.042]  That's how old I am.
[02:19:25.483 --> 02:19:29.684]  When I started at University of Virginia in 1976.
[02:19:30.324 --> 02:19:36.326]  So it's really important because, so I had to get a degree in chemistry, a BA.
[02:19:36.386 --> 02:19:38.247]  I couldn't get a Bachelor of Science.
[02:19:38.587 --> 02:19:42.489]  And so somehow you see them twist everything around.
[02:19:45.029 --> 02:19:46.411]  Let me stop you here, Judy.
[02:19:46.451 --> 02:19:47.693]  We're going to come right back.
[02:19:47.754 --> 02:19:48.755]  Hopefully we'll fix the audio.
[02:19:48.775 --> 02:19:51.379]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:53.823]  I'm so glad she corrected that because she's right.
[02:19:53.883 --> 02:19:55.005]  They keep changing her bio.
[02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:57.449]  Be right back on the Kate Daly Show.
[02:19:57.529 --> 02:19:59.192]  I'm sorry, on the Alex Jones Show with Kate.
[02:19:59.904 --> 02:20:01.245]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:01.265 --> 02:20:03.166]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the hour.
[02:20:03.186 --> 02:20:06.048]  And a big thank you to Alex for having me come on.
[02:20:06.248 --> 02:20:11.752]  And by the way, my guest, the great, the fantastic Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[02:20:12.352 --> 02:20:14.694]  In fact, I know you saw her in the movie, Plandemic.
[02:20:14.874 --> 02:20:25.501]  Her books, truly, you cannot put them down because she really goes through exactly what happened, what she discovered in some of her medical discoveries that were so amazing.
[02:20:25.801 --> 02:20:34.268]   I'm so glad you corrected that, Judy, because there is such an onslaught Of rewriting on the internet going on and trying to diminish those that speak out.
[02:20:34.509 --> 02:20:36.491]  Thank you so much for doing that, actually.
[02:20:37.752 --> 02:20:40.735]  And it's actually more important than diminishing me.
[02:20:41.455 --> 02:20:46.721]  It's taking things like type one interferon out of the equation.
[02:20:47.121 --> 02:20:51.846]  Because when I was a technician, my job, so I started June 10, 1980.
[02:20:53.527 --> 02:20:56.249]  And my job was fermentation chemistry.
[02:20:56.629 --> 02:21:09.980]  And as we tell the story in my book, the interferon was on the cover of Time Magazine as the big if, was this the magic bullet for cancer, was the whole idea.
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:12.101]  That was March 31st, 1980.
[02:21:13.542 --> 02:21:27.729]   So I didn't appreciate then, but I'm like at the time I wasn't going to medical school I didn't fit the listen to you and memorize stuff and not think persona of an MD.
[02:21:27.809 --> 02:21:29.790]  So I wasn't going to go to medical school.
[02:21:30.250 --> 02:21:35.511]  So I'm here thinking I didn't even know there was such a thing as a PhD, another kind of doctor.
[02:21:35.531 --> 02:21:39.164]   So I I basically didn't.
[02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:45.609]  Some of my grades weren't so good because of, you'll see it in the book, Ending Plague.
[02:21:45.649 --> 02:21:53.416]  So our last book, our latest book, is called Ending Plague, A Scholar's Obligation in an Age of Corruption.
[02:21:54.176 --> 02:21:58.220]  And that's Frank Rossetti's story.
[02:21:58.300 --> 02:22:15.028]   So when I started June 10, 1980, I was in fermentation chemistry and I was fermenting biological response modifiers, natural products like plant things, red things, methylene blue things.
[02:22:15.509 --> 02:22:18.850]  I was making drugs from plants.
[02:22:18.990 --> 02:22:20.071]  That was my job.
[02:22:20.111 --> 02:22:23.292]  We didn't have molecular biology at the time.
[02:22:23.972 --> 02:22:32.885]   And I couldn't call myself a biochemist because I was All chemistry with a specialization in biology because we didn't have biochemistry.
[02:22:33.245 --> 02:22:36.692]  And it's important for what they want you to think.
[02:22:37.538 --> 02:22:41.100]  Because they said started in 1988 and then got a PhD.
[02:22:41.580 --> 02:22:50.864]  And so even in some of the articles that came out after the pandemic came out, one was really fun and AIDS research in human retroviruses.
[02:22:51.264 --> 02:22:58.628]  It said something like XMRV COVID and the toxic legacy of Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[02:22:59.489 --> 02:23:04.576]  And I mean, Frank was horrified and I'm like, Frank, it's the blueprint.
[02:23:04.596 --> 02:23:05.918]  It tells you everything.
[02:23:06.238 --> 02:23:12.928]  So when you don't care what they say about you and you try to figure out why they said it.
[02:23:13.718 --> 02:23:19.683]  Then you start to understand what they don't want the rest of the world to know.
[02:23:19.703 --> 02:23:45.128]   And so what they've done with people like Dr. McCullough and Dr. Malone and the MDs is they spin out these drugs like Paxlovid and other things and they demonize vitamins, minerals, natural products, things low, low, low, low dose. That's where I hold my
[02:23:45.128 --> 02:23:50.998]   patents in nutritional biochemistry and how to use medical drugs because I make
[02:23:50.998 --> 02:23:57.417]   those drugs as efficiently as you can in the patient population while you
[02:23:57.417 --> 02:24:02.818]   support the side effect with nutrition.
[02:24:01.336 --> 02:24:03.018]  And they don't want you to know that.
[02:24:03.178 --> 02:24:03.658]  Why?
[02:24:04.098 --> 02:24:05.780]  Because you would cure cancer.
[02:24:05.800 --> 02:24:14.366]  The magic bullet, type 1 interferon, your own biological response modifier right there.
[02:24:14.967 --> 02:24:20.491]  We can purify it from cows and that's how it's made as a purified protein.
[02:24:21.251 --> 02:24:25.936]  And so the FDA won't let us label that a vaccine.
[02:24:26.436 --> 02:24:27.918]  And in fact, it is.
[02:24:28.438 --> 02:24:31.120]  And so you go all the way back to 1992.
[02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:41.690]  And on the Stu Peters show last week, he asked me about that when they were experimenting on children in a text message to see if I would go on the show.
[02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:44.453]  And I said, sure, but how about look at this?
[02:24:45.569 --> 02:25:07.056]  And the look at this was how ABC News in a like 7 or 10 minute clip in 1992 when I got my PhD, November 14, 1991, Magic Johnson was seropositive, meaning he made an antibody to HIV in November 7, 1991.
[02:25:07.856 --> 02:25:14.618]  I defended my PhD thesis at the molecular level and biochemistry level a week later.
[02:25:15.018 --> 02:25:24.383]  And all my thesis committee said is, based on your thesis, will she or will he or will he not get AIDS?
[02:25:24.863 --> 02:25:35.990]   And what I said was, I drew on the little chalkboard as I always do, my little CPG and methylation and on-off switch, I said, but he has to change Everything.
[02:25:36.631 --> 02:25:42.697]  He has to literally change everything because they had scared everybody and this is what Mickey Willis told me.
[02:25:43.018 --> 02:25:55.271]  So you see, I didn't even understand when we wrote the first book, in one scientist's intrepid search for the truth about human disease causing retroviruses.
[02:25:55.951 --> 02:26:02.216]  It's not human retroviruses, it's disease associated or disease causing.
[02:26:02.536 --> 02:26:08.441]  And so in that third book and you start to see, oh no, because Mickey Willis said, my brother died of AZT.
[02:26:08.681 --> 02:26:09.882]  And I said, don't you mean AIDS?
[02:26:10.322 --> 02:26:11.423]  And this is 19.
[02:26:11.663 --> 02:26:16.207]  I sat down with him in March or April, our book Plague of Corruption was done.
[02:26:16.567 --> 02:26:27.673]   This was supposed to be a 20 minute promotional video because nobody bought Plague because it's hard to read and nobody really cared.
[02:26:28.213 --> 02:26:34.636]  So, you know, about retroviruses, most people don't know what they are and all they know is HIV.
[02:26:35.137 --> 02:26:38.858]  So what we now know, I said, wait a minute, don't you mean AIDS?
[02:26:39.819 --> 02:26:42.940]  And he said, no, AZT, because he was antibody positive.
[02:26:43.380 --> 02:26:48.183]  So now we've tweaked in the fraudulent PCR test and we're saying tested positive.
[02:26:48.483 --> 02:26:53.767]  And we wouldn't let anybody in COVID see if they already had antibodies.
[02:26:54.127 --> 02:26:57.049]  Well what happened in the XMRV story?
[02:26:57.369 --> 02:26:58.650]  Well what they said was...
[02:26:59.548 --> 02:27:09.039]  They didn't isolate natural XMRBs from people with disease and show they could be transmitted to other people and they would get disease.
[02:27:09.480 --> 02:27:12.944]  That's satisfying, if you will, Koch's postulates.
[02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:14.906]  So they flipped.
[02:27:15.406 --> 02:27:20.149]  XMRV and said I sprinkled recombinant fairy dust.
[02:27:20.509 --> 02:27:23.150]  Oh, that would be a PCR product.
[02:27:23.430 --> 02:27:24.551]  The spike protein.
[02:27:24.771 --> 02:27:27.312]  So you've amplified and contaminated.
[02:27:27.332 --> 02:27:31.114]  They said our PCR was contaminated with mouse DNA.
[02:27:31.334 --> 02:27:35.036]  There's no such thing as xenotropic foreign.
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:38.941]  That's what the mouse stands for.
[02:27:39.441 --> 02:27:42.162]  Murine, mouse leukemia virus.
[02:27:42.282 --> 02:27:49.785]  It causes cancer if you put that one peptide of the spike protein called syncytin.
[02:27:50.205 --> 02:27:53.527]  Oh, wait a minute, that would be a component of snake venom.
[02:27:54.187 --> 02:27:58.689]  And so you start to see, and it's like, do they have an antidote?
[02:27:58.729 --> 02:27:59.950]  Well, of course they do.
[02:28:00.270 --> 02:28:01.350]  They're not going to inject.
[02:28:01.430 --> 02:28:04.031]  Why can't you inject animal viruses?
[02:28:05.132 --> 02:28:05.412]  Why?
[02:28:06.359 --> 02:28:10.123]  Because all animals have syncytin.
[02:28:10.463 --> 02:28:12.986]  They have their own God-given virome.
[02:28:13.246 --> 02:28:14.827]  Whole bunches of viruses.
[02:28:15.148 --> 02:28:19.852]  When you read Plague of Corruption, Bobby's forward, he talks a lot about SV40.
[02:28:21.093 --> 02:28:23.155]  Simeon, monkey, virus, 40.
[02:28:24.155 --> 02:28:36.063]  It's the 40th virus they isolated and that variant caused, associated, not caused, with mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung.
[02:28:36.484 --> 02:28:42.788]   So you see, when you break this all down and you trust God and you You asked the question.
[02:28:42.828 --> 02:28:43.709]  It's not about me.
[02:28:44.049 --> 02:28:45.530]  So I didn't read that toxic leg.
[02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:47.031]  At least I said, wait a minute, Frank.
[02:28:47.291 --> 02:28:58.979]  So two weeks after Plague, a pandemic came out, they went to the premier retrovirology meeting in the world, which is called Cold Spring Harbor.
[02:28:59.059 --> 02:29:00.100]  Oh, that would be that place.
[02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:06.345]  They did eugenics up there with Watson and Crick and where the Lyme disease came from.
[02:29:06.565 --> 02:29:07.626]  Would you start to see?
[02:29:07.706 --> 02:29:09.387]  And I was only there once.
[02:29:10.391 --> 02:29:11.572]  In 1992.
[02:29:12.252 --> 02:29:17.355]  And what was my work that I showed there from after my PhD thesis?
[02:29:17.695 --> 02:29:29.261]  That you don't need infectious virus to cause the damage, to cause the dominoes to all fall down and cause AIDS.
[02:29:29.721 --> 02:29:32.863]  Because it doesn't cause AIDS unless you do that.
[02:29:33.383 --> 02:29:36.988]  It's not the presence of the virus, it's the expression of the virus.
[02:29:37.369 --> 02:29:44.278]  And so if you express another animal syncytin or in aborted fetal cells, that's another human syncytin.
[02:29:44.318 --> 02:29:49.085]  We're going to come right back more with Dr. Judy Mikevitz on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:49.245 --> 02:29:49.766]  Be right back.
[02:29:53.832 --> 02:30:04.294]  I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there, and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[02:30:05.094 --> 02:30:06.794]  This book is that important.
[02:30:06.834 --> 02:30:08.735]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:30:09.115 --> 02:30:22.738]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[02:30:22.858 --> 02:30:29.882]  I'll match up and I will go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[02:30:30.103 --> 02:30:34.205]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[02:30:34.245 --> 02:30:35.446]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[02:30:35.526 --> 02:30:37.748]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[02:30:38.347 --> 02:30:45.147]   against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of technology that empowers
[02:30:45.147 --> 02:30:45.847]  humanity.
[02:30:45.847 --> 02:30:53.347]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes,
[02:30:53.347 --> 02:30:56.347]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[02:30:56.347 --> 02:31:00.847]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[02:31:00.847 --> 02:31:07.347]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[02:31:07.603 --> 02:31:16.845]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[02:31:17.105 --> 02:31:20.206]  There is no new technology coming and they're blocking that.
[02:31:20.806 --> 02:31:26.829]  And so really, they're just imploding things under the cloud and pivot model to show that they can get that control over us.
[02:31:27.209 --> 02:31:29.150]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:42.096]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[02:31:42.536 --> 02:31:51.560]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:31:52.141 --> 02:31:53.001]  That is very rare.
[02:31:53.081 --> 02:31:56.703]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[02:31:57.523 --> 02:32:04.186]  This book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[02:32:04.746 --> 02:32:05.727]  This is no beach read.
[02:32:06.387 --> 02:32:07.568]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[02:32:07.588 --> 02:32:09.908]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlining stuff.
[02:32:10.028 --> 02:32:10.809]  It's amazing.
[02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:15.390]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[02:32:15.549 --> 02:32:20.188]  Available now on Amazon or inforstore.com.
[02:32:20.188 --> 02:32:27.908]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:27.954 --> 02:32:30.835]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:32:30.855 --> 02:32:32.656]  My guest is Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:35.221]  He talks about The Great Reset a lot.
[02:32:35.281 --> 02:32:41.002]  In fact, it sounds like a fantastic book that I must read immediately, Alex's book.
[02:32:41.543 --> 02:32:42.323]  Let me tell you this.
[02:32:42.343 --> 02:32:52.346]  You came out and said, I need to educate people on the effects of the mRNA COVID shots containing the poisonous peptide mimetic of snake venom.
[02:32:52.990 --> 02:33:01.397]  Since sitting and also this is in every single vaccine on the CDC schedule.
[02:33:01.498 --> 02:33:07.123]  In fact, you told me, you know, from 2017 on, you should not be taking any of their shots.
[02:33:07.603 --> 02:33:18.433]  And most importantly, well, also besides for all of the ailments and heart conditions, everything else, death that it's causing, it also poses danger to fertility.
[02:33:18.753 --> 02:33:19.934]  Do you want to talk about that, Judy?
[02:33:21.292 --> 02:33:21.753]  Oh, sure.
[02:33:21.773 --> 02:33:31.141]  Yeah, that's why I'm so excited about it, because that syncytin or syncytin protein, S-Y-N means synthesis.
[02:33:31.181 --> 02:33:33.443]  You synthesize cells together.
[02:33:33.703 --> 02:33:39.789]  Then cytin, C-Y-T-I-N or C-Y-T-O means cytocell.
[02:33:40.382 --> 02:33:49.169]  So, syncytin or syncytin, I always call it syncytin just because it's like mycobits with an I or mycobits, it's the same thing depending on what country you come from.
[02:33:49.489 --> 02:34:01.439]  Anyway, syncytin is going to fuse cells together and that in our God-given genome is a virus.
[02:34:01.679 --> 02:34:06.503]  Our own God-given human retrovirus genome is 8% of our genome.
[02:34:09.955 --> 02:34:14.617]  That is a God-given endogenous retroviruses.
[02:34:14.877 --> 02:34:24.501]  One of them is called human endogenous retrovirus W. And so that goes on the expression that on-off switch I was talking to you about.
[02:34:24.901 --> 02:34:27.142]  DNA methylation from latency.
[02:34:27.202 --> 02:34:28.882]  That was my PhD thesis.
[02:34:29.203 --> 02:34:32.844]  You keep HIV quiet and you're just fine.
[02:34:33.284 --> 02:34:34.445]  And you'll never get AIDS.
[02:34:34.545 --> 02:34:34.965]  Why?
[02:34:35.145 --> 02:34:37.365]  You don't get the cytokine storm.
[02:34:37.766 --> 02:34:41.887]  That very particular cytokine storm was NF-kB.
[02:34:42.547 --> 02:34:46.469]  And NF-kB is the on-off switch, the transcription factor.
[02:34:46.849 --> 02:34:49.570]  NF-kB controls antibody production.
[02:34:50.070 --> 02:35:02.060]   NF-kB's inflammatory cytokine storm is a TH1 inflammatory response with gamma interferon, TGF-beta
[02:35:02.060 --> 02:35:08.940]   IL-6, interleukin 6, is that cytokine and then chemokines to send fire trucks to
[02:35:08.940 --> 02:35:11.610]  the fire, trafficking molecules.
[02:35:11.610 --> 02:35:17.130]   So it turns on and it tells the blood stem cell what kind of fire it is.
[02:35:17.130 --> 02:35:18.730]  Is it a gasoline fire?
[02:35:18.730 --> 02:35:19.730]  Where is it in the body?
[02:35:19.730 --> 02:35:21.730]  Is it in the brain?
[02:35:21.730 --> 02:35:26.449]  So syncytin or syncytin is your God-given gene.
[02:35:26.449 --> 02:35:34.331]   When that goes on, you're waiting to implant the fertilized embryo into the uterine cell
[02:35:34.331 --> 02:35:35.331]  wall.
[02:35:35.331 --> 02:35:41.449]   So when the egg is fertilized with the sperm, that gene goes on and it's hormone-driven,
[02:35:41.449 --> 02:35:46.890]   which is why a woman with in vitro fertilization who can't have babies
[02:35:47.323 --> 02:35:53.883]   has to have hormone treatment first, because she has to make sure that gene is on,
[02:35:53.883 --> 02:35:58.563]   'cause once you take the test tube where you've done the fertilization,
[02:35:58.563 --> 02:36:02.223]   'cause their bodies can't, probably because they've been poisoned
[02:36:02.223 --> 02:36:10.123]   so many decades or generations by big pharma, they can't fertilize.
[02:36:09.995 --> 02:36:14.698]  So you fertilize it in the lab and then you implant it, but it has to stick.
[02:36:15.018 --> 02:36:20.541]  That's the Velcro that holds the fertilized embryo into the uterine cell wall.
[02:36:21.042 --> 02:36:29.847]  And then when the baby is too big and too much RNA and DNA is going into mom, half of that is non-self.
[02:36:30.607 --> 02:36:34.570]  So she'll have an autoimmune reaction and she'll get disease.
[02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:40.475]  That's our age factor when with mom and dad because half of it is a foreign person.
[02:36:40.515 --> 02:36:43.237]  So you'll have an autoimmune autoinflammatory.
[02:36:43.478 --> 02:36:50.203]  So then that gene goes off when the baby's that big and the baby's born and the various contractions go on.
[02:36:50.243 --> 02:36:52.445]  I mean, it's beautiful when you see how God works.
[02:36:52.925 --> 02:36:54.926]  But they don't want you to know.
[02:36:55.187 --> 02:36:59.229]  So if you put another human syncytin, that's aborted fetal cell lines.
[02:36:59.590 --> 02:37:22.038]   If you put cow, if you put pig, if you put monkey, if you put mouse, if you put lizard syncytin, That's how our body knows that those are all mammals that carry their young so a snake doesn't eat the egg or whatever in the environment.
[02:37:22.418 --> 02:37:33.321]  So again, if you inject another animal syncytin and every shot does this, but the worst is they engineered it into the COVID bioweapon.
[02:37:34.039 --> 02:37:40.029]  Notice how the COVID bioweapon doesn't say vaccine for SARS-CoV-2?
[02:37:40.049 --> 02:37:44.696]  Because SARS-CoV-2 is the monkey virus.
[02:37:45.177 --> 02:37:49.143]  And the COVID-19 shot is humanized.
[02:37:49.563 --> 02:37:55.049]  The monkey's been injected for decades and it only hurt the most vulnerable and they knew it.
[02:37:55.089 --> 02:37:58.874]  They were experimenting on the blacks who have great vitamin D receptors.
[02:37:59.174 --> 02:38:04.400]  So it's the sensors on the surface of the cell they've been deliberately messing with.
[02:38:04.740 --> 02:38:05.861]  And I'll tell you how to fix it.
[02:38:05.901 --> 02:38:12.001]   And Alex Jones is saying Buy it!
[02:38:12.682 --> 02:38:28.559]  I mean, we've got Get Healthy Store and I'm going to find out how to get his book in the Get Healthy Store and how to get his products linked on our website because we're selling similar minerals, but there's so many things out there that people can do.
[02:38:28.579 --> 02:38:33.364]  We'll be right back with Dr. Judy Mikevitz on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:34.597 --> 02:38:36.318]  I'm back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:36.378 --> 02:38:39.340]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:38:39.881 --> 02:38:51.409]  About six months ago, Attorney Tom Rents and Senator Ron Johnson had their COVID panel for the very corrupt government that we have, presented the findings, and the findings were insane.
[02:38:52.029 --> 02:38:53.030]  487 spike in breast cancer.
[02:38:53.050 --> 02:38:54.311]  279% spike in miscarriages.
[02:38:54.331 --> 02:38:55.632]  1000% spike in nervous system problems.
[02:38:55.652 --> 02:38:57.074]  I mean 350% spike in male infertility.
[02:38:57.094 --> 02:38:58.375]  369% spike in testicular cancer.
[02:38:58.194 --> 02:39:07.554]   spike in nervous system problems. I mean 350% spike in male infertility, 369%
[02:39:07.554 --> 02:39:11.834]   spike in testicular cancer and I could go on and on for all of the problems
[02:39:11.834 --> 02:39:15.954]   we're having with heart and everything else. And so my guest is Dr. Judy
[02:39:15.954 --> 02:39:20.514]  Mijkovic answering some of these questions.
[02:39:18.932 --> 02:39:20.594]  And we just talked about fertility.
[02:39:20.954 --> 02:39:22.535]  We're going to see fertility problems.
[02:39:22.976 --> 02:39:31.543]  The other thing people want to know, Dr. Mikovits, is whether or not somebody would test positive for AIDS having these shots.
[02:39:32.443 --> 02:39:36.005]  Specifically the boosters and of course the first shot.
[02:39:36.425 --> 02:39:37.845]  But would it take the boosters?
[02:39:38.225 --> 02:39:41.867]  And I would love for you to answer this because I've been asked this many many times.
[02:39:42.127 --> 02:39:44.688]  Will you test positive for HIV?
[02:39:48.009 --> 02:39:48.469]  Correct.
[02:39:48.509 --> 02:40:00.912]  You will test positive for HIV, and we're not sure which shots, but as we know from our book, Ending Plague, they engineered into that spike protein, there are three parts to it.
[02:40:01.032 --> 02:40:02.032]  It's a little tulip.
[02:40:02.432 --> 02:40:09.334]  And this is a paper they actually published in 2004, simian immune deficiency, SARS-CoV-2.
[02:40:10.496 --> 02:40:29.214]   Is part SIV, part XMRV from the monkey, the monkey syncytin, and the SARS-CoV-2, sorry, the coronavirus The SARS receptor binding domain from the ACE2 receptor.
[02:40:29.554 --> 02:40:38.162]  So they made, because you use that binding domain in the spike protein to make it aerosolized so that you breathe it in.
[02:40:38.563 --> 02:40:50.374]  Because normally retroviruses are only spread through blood and body fluids because you need pieces and parts of animal cells in order to get the pro-virus.
[02:40:50.994 --> 02:40:52.395]  Unless you inject it.
[02:40:52.815 --> 02:40:59.499]  So now you're going to test positive by PCR for HIV.
[02:41:00.399 --> 02:41:18.855]   And if you've already been injected or you've already been infected, either with the monkey one or With the human one by AIR and you've made antibodies, these are absolutely the people who don't want to get another shot.
[02:41:19.455 --> 02:41:24.601]  So no matter which way you got it, stop the shots.
[02:41:25.262 --> 02:41:36.926]   Never get another shot because every single shot Has either monkey, mouse, or manufactured HIV spike protein.
[02:41:36.986 --> 02:41:37.326]  Pardon?
[02:41:37.606 --> 02:41:41.508]  It's just a little peptide, so it's just a few base pairs.
[02:41:41.888 --> 02:41:50.231]  And when they change a base pair or two, you know, A, T, C, and G, you know, they're telling you that you're only your mRNA.
[02:41:50.311 --> 02:41:53.473]  No, you're your chromosomes, and God's giving you everything you need.
[02:41:53.813 --> 02:41:58.395]  And if you get those minerals, see they, so they depleted our soil of minerals.
[02:41:59.128 --> 02:42:03.813]  They caused the MTHFR mutation.
[02:42:03.873 --> 02:42:08.037]  That single nucleotide polymorphism is epigenetics.
[02:42:08.097 --> 02:42:11.621]  That's not the way God made us four generations back.
[02:42:11.981 --> 02:42:18.007]  It's how long they've been injecting us and they hit the hot spot so that you get infected.
[02:42:18.248 --> 02:42:20.050]  Yeah, look at every one of those persons.
[02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:22.312]  So they're wearing masks.
[02:42:22.652 --> 02:42:25.934]  So they're making themselves have an adverse reaction.
[02:42:26.214 --> 02:42:37.721]  They're activating the latent viruses of that 8% of your human virome and the ones your body has silenced because we don't all get sick from those shots.
[02:42:38.101 --> 02:42:40.383]  So they loaded up the most susceptible.
[02:42:40.423 --> 02:42:43.545]  They looked at the vitamin D. They looked at the minerals.
[02:42:43.885 --> 02:42:46.107]  They looked at the curcumin, those pathways.
[02:42:46.187 --> 02:42:55.913]  Curcumin modulates that NF kappa B. So when you start to see what the bad guys in the Crimes Against Humanity Tour, what they do?
[02:42:56.293 --> 02:42:58.815]  Oh, they tried to capture Alex Jones.
[02:42:59.375 --> 02:43:01.617]  They tried to make Alex Jones look bad.
[02:43:01.677 --> 02:43:05.179]  They tried to make Judy Mikevitz and Reiner Fulmish look bad.
[02:43:05.199 --> 02:43:12.799]   Because Reiner was testifying against against the PCR test, which was literally fraud.
[02:43:12.799 --> 02:43:16.399]  How you make the primers is what you detect.
[02:43:16.399 --> 02:43:21.040]   So they find what they wanna find, and that's the real plague.
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:24.399]  I think that's one of the last lines of our first book.
[02:43:24.399 --> 02:43:32.239]   So you see, we gave them a blueprint in our research of how to attack and poison your food.
[02:43:32.239 --> 02:43:37.480]   And in all of our books, but especially in our last book, "Ending Plague,"
[02:43:37.480 --> 02:43:41.280]  We talk about Stephanie Seneff's book, "Toxic Legacy."
[02:43:41.399 --> 02:43:42.600]  It's glyphosate.
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:52.243]  So when Brian Artis is saying the water is poison, glyphosate, XMRVs get into cells through a phosphate transporter.
[02:43:52.763 --> 02:44:00.746]  But all your proteins, the 3% of your messenger RNA that's translated into protein, they're post-translation.
[02:44:01.066 --> 02:44:10.050]  After you make the protein, how do we make it fit the human's environment, whether you're a black person, whether you're a white person, whether you live in Sweden?
[02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:16.474]  Whether you live in India, you eat different food, you have different microbes in your water, you get monosumas, it's all food.
[02:44:16.934 --> 02:44:22.678]  And it's also, these are the toughest races that can live in blazing sun or freezing cold.
[02:44:23.078 --> 02:44:31.203]   And God gave you that modification so the sensors, it's the sensors on your cell surfaces, And so it's just signaling.
[02:44:31.483 --> 02:44:39.905]  And so we're missing the minerals, we're missing the dimethylglycine, we're missing the type 1 interferons because they cripple the pathway and they knew exactly how to do it.
[02:44:40.205 --> 02:44:47.368]  The XMRVs integrate into hotspots in CPG, it's called islands.
[02:44:47.648 --> 02:44:51.209]  That's the on-off switches for your God-given viruses to protect you.
[02:44:51.629 --> 02:44:54.530]  So they get in there and they change them forever.
[02:44:55.265 --> 02:45:02.708]  That MTHFR M677, C677T.
[02:45:03.148 --> 02:45:05.249]  That's a C to T transmission.
[02:45:05.609 --> 02:45:08.850]  The C gets regulated, turn off and on.
[02:45:09.290 --> 02:45:10.170]  The T doesn't.
[02:45:10.690 --> 02:45:17.133]  So God did that to protect us from building up homocysteine and having a heart attack and die.
[02:45:17.453 --> 02:45:18.493]  What do the shots do?
[02:45:18.813 --> 02:45:20.354]  They cause myocarditis.
[02:45:21.461 --> 02:45:26.024]  Oh, but your homocysteine doesn't build up because God protected us from the poison.
[02:45:26.344 --> 02:45:37.472]  So, Eve, if we just stop today, that's why I'm so excited today, because I just sat down and did two and a half hours of chemistry, said, OK, Doc, with a fabulous doc here, I won't say his name.
[02:45:37.752 --> 02:45:40.714]  And you don't know where I am, except for the phone knows where I am.
[02:45:41.535 --> 02:45:42.655]  So I had to drive.
[02:45:42.695 --> 02:45:47.799]  I had to get up at four in the morning to get here to be with you today and to get to that meeting with him.
[02:45:47.819 --> 02:45:56.726]   So so that but the point is, so I'm going to go right to my publicist and say, get Alex Jones books.
[02:45:57.046 --> 02:46:09.096]  We've put all of our books in the Get Healthy store because until the doctors can read and the real Anthony Fauci as well, because what's important about the real Anthony Fauci?
[02:46:09.136 --> 02:46:10.017]  I mean, it's brilliant.
[02:46:10.037 --> 02:46:11.939]  I just can't even tell you how brilliant it is.
[02:46:12.679 --> 02:46:16.981]  And I had to listen to it because my mind gets blown and I just have to turn it off.
[02:46:17.321 --> 02:46:22.163]  And if I read it, I'm going to fill in the gaps of the biochemistry pathway and that won't work.
[02:46:22.503 --> 02:46:25.824]  So I can fix it later, but we'll write further volumes.
[02:46:25.924 --> 02:46:26.625]  I hope he will.
[02:46:27.425 --> 02:46:32.707]  But at any rate, what's important about it is they don't even say.
[02:46:33.826 --> 02:46:40.869]  The word XMRB or Judy Mikovits and it's said once in the book but not in the acknowledgements.
[02:46:41.329 --> 02:46:53.433]  And that's the kudos Mickey Willis, kudos Alex Jones, kudos Mike Adams, kudos everybody, Stephanie Senner, Peter McCullough, Robert Malone, because they don't want us talking to each other.
[02:46:53.874 --> 02:46:57.755]  They don't want the MDs to understand the biochemistry.
[02:46:58.155 --> 02:47:06.963]   And that's why it was said in this tour that I attacked So you can look at the other article that came right out after Plandemic.
[02:47:07.624 --> 02:47:11.689]  That one was a week and it was Science Magazine.
[02:47:11.729 --> 02:47:16.275]  Just go to sciencemag.org and search Mikevitz and Cohen.
[02:47:16.355 --> 02:47:16.816]  C-O-H-E-N.
[02:47:17.785 --> 02:47:33.316]  And you'll find how the scientific literature, as Tess Lorre on Del Bigtree Show, the Informed Consent Action Network, as she said, oh, they took the journal articles and they're criminal fraud.
[02:47:33.777 --> 02:47:49.277]   So when you start to see, and they told them, publish faster the negative studies on ivermectin, it's a purinergic modulator, and they write the word that I'm a virologist who attacked I didn't attack Tony Fauci.
[02:47:49.598 --> 02:47:52.139]  I sat there and said, no, you don't understand.
[02:47:52.620 --> 02:47:55.562]  You don't give AZT when a man is antibody positive.
[02:47:55.622 --> 02:47:57.883]  Is that an attack on Tony Fauci?
[02:47:58.323 --> 02:48:00.185]  That's what Mickey Willis said.
[02:48:00.985 --> 02:48:03.147]  He'll get antibody dependent enhancement.
[02:48:03.187 --> 02:48:04.347]  You don't do that.
[02:48:04.488 --> 02:48:05.708]  I'm going to come right back.
[02:48:05.728 --> 02:48:08.430]  I'm going to come right back with Dr. Judy Mikevitz.
[02:48:08.650 --> 02:48:10.552]  And I have so many questions for her.
[02:48:10.692 --> 02:48:15.335]  So many things that we need to learn in this hour about the shots and what's coming.
[02:48:15.375 --> 02:48:17.176]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:19.678 --> 02:48:20.979]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:48:21.019 --> 02:48:23.961]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:48:24.061 --> 02:48:25.302]  So glad you're joining us.
[02:48:25.342 --> 02:48:26.583]  This is an important hour.
[02:48:26.603 --> 02:48:31.487]  I want to learn so much from Dr. Judy Mikevitz, and I always do every time I talk with her.
[02:48:31.807 --> 02:48:33.548]  There's a couple of things that have been happening.
[02:48:33.668 --> 02:48:38.772]  Everybody's been noticing all the lying, all of that, well lies from the beginning, but all the backtracking.
[02:48:39.092 --> 02:48:41.194]  Fauci said he never said flatten the curve.
[02:48:41.254 --> 02:48:47.518]   CDC, Rochelle said they had too much optimism and not enough Caution, so sorry about all those shots.
[02:48:47.898 --> 02:48:54.461]  And then, of course, King fraud a lot, saying that you couldn't get sick, and many others, after, you know, you took the shots.
[02:48:54.501 --> 02:48:55.821]  And, of course, you can.
[02:48:56.481 --> 02:48:58.822]  And they said, now, they've never said that.
[02:48:58.982 --> 02:49:05.145]  So, I don't know if they know that in this technology today, we actually have video of everybody saying these things, and I play them on my show all the time.
[02:49:05.605 --> 02:49:07.766]  But, my gosh, this is getting ridiculous.
[02:49:08.326 --> 02:49:25.353]  And so, there's a couple of questions I have for you, and I think, sometimes, I think so much is going to go over my head in scientific speak, but I know that there are certain things I'm going to take away, and I'm going to understand from this conversation, Judy, because you're so brilliant, and you've done so much to educate.
[02:49:25.834 --> 02:49:33.437]  And so, I would like to know, you know, you knew, you probably guessed that these lies were going to come back, and they were going to have to say they'd never said them.
[02:49:34.077 --> 02:49:36.220]  What happens next with the shots?
[02:49:36.280 --> 02:49:38.402]  Do you feel like something is coming this fall?
[02:49:38.422 --> 02:49:42.546]  Do they have another shot sequence, drip system I call it, coming out?
[02:49:43.087 --> 02:49:46.230]  What happens this fall, do you think, fall and winter going into 2023?
[02:49:46.310 --> 02:49:47.051]  Well, I hope what happens...
[02:49:51.730 --> 02:50:03.078]  Is that people realize, so we just put out a video, the We is Dr. Ben Marble, MD, so at I think MyFreeDoctor.com.
[02:50:03.578 --> 02:50:11.083]  And so Ben Marble just put out a video of a whole bunch of doctors saying, stop the shot.
[02:50:12.124 --> 02:50:13.125]  Stop the shot.
[02:50:13.225 --> 02:50:18.352]  And so I talked and I also said, I said, please stop the shot.
[02:50:19.193 --> 02:50:20.174]  All the shots.
[02:50:20.655 --> 02:50:25.201]  Because if nobody gets another shot.
[02:50:26.115 --> 02:50:31.979]  They just lied about everything in the past 50 years.
[02:50:32.299 --> 02:50:33.640]  You've been lied to.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:37.863]  You can tell now, as Alex just said, about those supplements.
[02:50:38.184 --> 02:50:47.890]  I wrote down every one of them because I'm going to buy them and hope that Alex will link them to our real Dr. Judy, TheRealDrJudy.com.
[02:50:47.970 --> 02:50:57.094]   I'm hoping we can put them in our Get Healthy Store, including, if not the products, in our The book.
[02:50:57.534 --> 02:51:00.797]  Because the books are so heavily censored, that's why I said it.
[02:51:00.817 --> 02:51:03.559]  Because the doctors aren't being educated.
[02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:08.944]  I don't want to sound, it's not false humility, but I'm not brilliant.
[02:51:09.124 --> 02:51:12.307]  I'm a biochemist and a molecular biologist.
[02:51:12.607 --> 02:51:17.351]  So that's why it's important that the article said she's a virologist.
[02:51:17.451 --> 02:51:19.453]  No, you practice what I discover.
[02:51:20.093 --> 02:51:21.014]  You practice.
[02:51:21.054 --> 02:51:26.858]  You don't get a PhD unless you change the way medicine is practiced.
[02:51:27.298 --> 02:51:31.581]  So we now know HIV doesn't cause AIDS.
[02:51:31.861 --> 02:51:42.027]  Yes, we can put a banner right off the bottom to say get these products or we can import them right into the company called Get Healthy Store.
[02:51:42.067 --> 02:51:45.129]   And Dr. Tracy, Helps us do that.
[02:51:45.209 --> 02:51:46.970]  So we've done that in the last six months.
[02:51:47.250 --> 02:51:53.114]  So what everybody has to realize right now is shame on you if you ever get another shot.
[02:51:53.614 --> 02:51:55.375]  At least until they're cleaned up.
[02:51:55.756 --> 02:52:06.662]  And my initial, when we were doing this ten, five, ten years ago, when our first book came out, I said a moratorium on all vaccines until the safety studies are done.
[02:52:07.003 --> 02:52:10.345]  What people don't realize is every shot is warp speed.
[02:52:10.725 --> 02:52:11.065]  Why?
[02:52:11.225 --> 02:52:12.146]  They're never tested.
[02:52:12.646 --> 02:52:15.269]  None of the animal debris is ever removed.
[02:52:15.669 --> 02:52:18.753]  And that's a 2017 paper by Gotti.
[02:52:19.153 --> 02:52:24.599]  The minerals, the graphene oxide, the heavy metals, they're in all the shots, folks.
[02:52:24.939 --> 02:52:27.502]  And I use that in vaccine court.
[02:52:27.922 --> 02:52:34.269]  And shortly before they said Judy Mikevich and Frank Rossetti can't give opinions in vaccine court.
[02:52:38.251 --> 02:52:42.152]  We're experts because we don't have an MD behind our name.
[02:52:42.532 --> 02:52:45.853]  So you see they're purposely trying to divide us.
[02:52:46.194 --> 02:52:56.557]  But if people realize it's as simple as buying mineral supplements and vitamins, nitric oxide is a gas, they made Viagra.
[02:52:57.177 --> 02:53:03.720]  You know, oh, so they made a lot of money out of your erectile dysfunction after they poisoned you with glyphosate.
[02:53:04.100 --> 02:53:09.342]  And this is why Stephanie Seneff's book, The Toxic Legacy, is in our Get Healthy store.
[02:53:09.382 --> 02:53:16.886]  So we tell you the causes, but what I was trained to do is never tell you the cause until you have a solution.
[02:53:17.226 --> 02:53:19.247]  We don't incite fear.
[02:53:19.727 --> 02:53:21.688]  You've had vaccines all along.
[02:53:22.566 --> 02:53:27.110]  Paximune is a vaccine for AIDS.
[02:53:27.530 --> 02:53:31.234]  That's the drug I made in my first three years.
[02:53:31.834 --> 02:53:32.715]  That's important.
[02:53:33.776 --> 02:53:34.877]  I have a question for you.
[02:53:35.017 --> 02:53:45.566]  When they take a sample from a sick person, do they have to drag it through animal tissue, animal specimens, animal cell lines, in order to figure out whether or not you're sick?
[02:53:45.385 --> 02:53:48.385]  Um, no.
[02:53:48.385 --> 02:53:53.385]  No, no.
[02:53:53.385 --> 02:53:54.385]  No way they're doing that.
[02:53:54.891 --> 02:54:00.599]  The way they're doing the testing, a PCR, the virus isn't the disease.
[02:54:01.180 --> 02:54:03.283]  HIV is not AIDS.
[02:54:03.623 --> 02:54:05.166]  That's why I mentioned Mickey Willis.
[02:54:05.466 --> 02:54:06.207]  He died of AZT.
[02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:09.192]  What are people dying of?
[02:54:09.272 --> 02:54:10.593]  Not SARS-CoV-2.
[02:54:11.174 --> 02:54:24.390]  They're dying of isolation, the masks transmitting bacterial infections and destroying your glutathione which is also depleted because of glyphosate toxicity.
[02:54:24.671 --> 02:54:28.004]   Glyphosate is glycine Correct.
[02:54:28.364 --> 02:54:30.645]  And your soil is depleted of minerals.
[02:54:30.705 --> 02:54:34.065]  You must have clean amino acids and minerals.
[02:54:34.466 --> 02:54:36.526]  And Alex Jones is right.
[02:54:36.946 --> 02:54:40.427]  We've got to buy it now because they've already told you.
[02:54:40.747 --> 02:54:42.507]  They're taking N-acetylcysteine.
[02:54:42.527 --> 02:54:48.108]  They're taking glutathione, these supplements, a supply chain.
[02:54:48.349 --> 02:54:50.289]  They stop trucks from shipping.
[02:54:50.909 --> 02:54:54.990]  If you don't get this now, you can't get clean food.
[02:54:55.630 --> 02:55:10.743]  So they poisoned your food and your animals first, because PaxImmune was going to be used, and actually PaxImmune, the company, P-A-X-I-M-U-N-E, that's used for animals.
[02:55:11.083 --> 02:55:18.270]  And the FDA stopped Joe Cummins, this is in our book Ending Plague, from using it to make animals.
[02:55:18.310 --> 02:55:21.993]  So when animals express their viruses, you eat them.
[02:55:23.010 --> 02:55:30.794]  And so then you can get viruses by eating them because glyphosate puts holes in your stomach, as Andy Wakefield discovered.
[02:55:30.854 --> 02:55:31.935]  So do the vaccines.
[02:55:32.315 --> 02:55:34.176]  That's what Andy Wakefield saw.
[02:55:34.236 --> 02:55:36.537]  He's a gastroenterologist.
[02:55:37.137 --> 02:55:38.998]  Oh, you get inflammation.
[02:55:39.038 --> 02:55:40.499]  You turn the flame on.
[02:55:40.779 --> 02:55:45.222]  So you see, there won't be any other shots if we turn them off.
[02:55:48.533 --> 02:55:51.315]  The truth sets you free.
[02:55:51.355 --> 02:56:00.703]  The reason I'm so happy today is I just had a three-hour interaction with a practitioner who's seeing the injuries and all we have to do is put a little food to it.
[02:56:01.043 --> 02:56:05.227]  And now I'm sitting here with you and you know you didn't even ask me till last night.
[02:56:07.469 --> 02:56:14.835]  And now I see the products and now I see the book and I see the connections and I see how they're trying to divide us.
[02:56:15.115 --> 02:56:29.701]   They want people not We are in God alone and we love everybody and we put healthy essential oils and we clean our house not with petroleum products.
[02:56:29.761 --> 02:56:33.083]  We don't put, you know, poisonous sunscreen on.
[02:56:33.123 --> 02:56:36.105]  We go outside and get an hour a day sun.
[02:56:36.145 --> 02:56:39.707]  You get the wavelength of 222 which is kryptonite.
[02:56:39.727 --> 02:56:41.107]  That's like 11 in the morning.
[02:56:41.388 --> 02:56:42.788]  That's visible range.
[02:56:43.069 --> 02:56:53.996]   You know, it's like all of the solutions are there and when we all talk to each other we realize, wait a minute, I worked with all of this and they were experimenting on the lab workers first.
[02:56:54.497 --> 02:56:59.161]  I sero-converted to Omicron in 2010.
[02:56:59.701 --> 02:57:00.963]  I made an antibody.
[02:57:01.063 --> 02:57:06.728]  Why do you think Melinda Gates said, oh let's get the healthcare workers, the doctors and nurses?
[02:57:07.128 --> 02:57:09.031]  Because they have to die.
[02:57:09.372 --> 02:57:11.354]  It's nosocomial spread.
[02:57:11.795 --> 02:57:14.639]  And it's all in the literature and they've told you all of that.
[02:57:14.940 --> 02:57:18.125]  And they turned all the literature into fraud between 2011 when they jailed me.
[02:57:20.621 --> 02:57:24.443]  And 2019, when our second book was going to come out.
[02:57:24.823 --> 02:57:27.205]  But see, they can't do anything about it.
[02:57:27.505 --> 02:57:33.668]  They can't do anything about it because the hard drive's been in the FBI's office since May of 2014.
[02:57:34.029 --> 02:57:35.830]  And they know we have all the samples.
[02:57:35.910 --> 02:57:37.030]  I have all the antibodies.
[02:57:37.310 --> 02:57:38.051]  I have the test.
[02:57:38.211 --> 02:58:03.347]   I can prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can get all of these infections and not And not ever get sick if you just simply do what Alex Jones says and some other products that we've now and technologies, even things like hyperbaric oxygen and that we've known from the beginning, folium PX, which is radiation poisoning in Chernobyl.
[02:58:03.687 --> 02:58:10.370]  So all the poisons in our environment, something as simple as micron silver, not nano silver.
[02:58:10.730 --> 02:58:12.931]  So it doesn't go in the cells.
[02:58:14.252 --> 02:58:17.739]  Judy, what website, we only have about 20 seconds, what website can you give people?
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:22.107]  The reason I asked you last night was I had just read your newsletter and it was amazing.
[02:58:22.147 --> 02:58:23.290]  Can you please tell people where to go?
[02:58:24.412 --> 02:58:27.013]  TheRealDrJudy.com.
[02:58:27.133 --> 02:58:29.393]  The Real Dr. Judy.
[02:58:29.553 --> 02:58:30.233]  There it is.
[02:58:30.633 --> 02:58:35.095]  And we just put it up starting last October when we realized all of it.
[02:58:35.395 --> 02:58:39.256]  We've been working very hard with every company, with every supplier.
[02:58:39.736 --> 02:58:46.617]  Everybody that we know makes a great product is in that store or on that site and is just food.
[02:58:47.878 --> 02:58:48.318]  Thank you.
[02:58:48.498 --> 02:58:49.978]  Thank you so much for joining me.
[02:58:50.378 --> 02:58:50.858]  So much.
[02:58:51.138 --> 02:58:51.558]  Thank you.
[02:58:52.159 --> 02:58:53.619]  And I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:58:53.458 --> 02:59:13.098]  Thanks for watching.
[02:59:13.838 --> 02:59:17.740]  We are now deciding the very future destiny of our species.
[02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:22.383]  And at the very forefront of that fight against the New World Order and their great reset is InfoWars.
[02:59:22.563 --> 02:59:30.907]  And it's you, the viewer and listener of this broadcast, that have paved the way for a real opposition to the New World Order that has a very good chance of defeating them.
[02:59:31.488 --> 02:59:33.129]  Even their own internal documents have leaked.
[02:59:33.885 --> 02:59:40.047]  Where the top globalists admit they're losing their war for the world and their war to take over humanity.
[02:59:40.367 --> 02:59:43.668]  But still, things are neck and neck and things are very, very close.
[02:59:44.228 --> 02:59:51.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, you've done an incredible job spreading the word about InfoWars, the broadcast, the articles, the videos, the special guests we have, our other great hosts.
[02:59:52.179 --> 02:59:53.680]  You've done an amazing job praying for us.
[02:59:54.021 --> 02:59:59.965]  You've done an incredible job buying the products and financially supporting us so we can support you in this critical fight.
[03:00:00.286 --> 03:00:08.072]  That's why I'm asking every viewer and every listener to understand we have reached the most critical point in our battle against the globalists in our 28-year history.
[03:00:09.133 --> 03:00:13.155]  We have major plans in development and major operations that are very close to being launched.
[03:00:13.495 --> 03:00:20.899]  We have so many projects that are not known to the enemy that we've been secretly financing, and just a lot of exciting things that have been going on.
[03:00:21.440 --> 03:00:23.661]  We only deliver with our information.
[03:00:23.681 --> 03:00:26.642]  We only deliver with real results against the New World Order.
[03:00:26.923 --> 03:00:29.064]  But we cannot do it without your support.
[03:00:29.104 --> 03:00:34.587]  So I'm asking you now, ladies and gentlemen, to not procrastinate and to go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:00:34.987 --> 03:00:36.808]  Plus, we've got items that you definitely want.
[03:00:37.248 --> 03:00:44.116]  Ladies and gentlemen, people have asked me for over 15 years, since I wrote my last book, to write a new book.
[03:00:44.797 --> 03:00:52.337]   And I finally got some of the researchers together and top editors to condense all the known enemy battle plans
[03:00:52.337 --> 03:00:56.058]   against humanity into this new book that comes out in August.

[03:01:10.538 --> 03:01:15.538]   Steve Bannon has said it is the most powerful book since the founding fathers when it comes
[03:01:15.538 --> 03:01:16.738]  to fighting tyranny.
[03:01:16.738 --> 03:01:20.618]   He said it's the blueprint of defeating the fourth turning New World Order takeover.
[03:01:20.618 --> 03:01:22.297]  I couldn't believe he said it, but it's true.
[03:01:22.297 --> 03:01:25.138]  He read the book and he was blown away.
[03:01:25.138 --> 03:01:27.458]   Others that have read the book have been completely blown away.
[03:01:27.458 --> 03:01:29.016]  You need to read this book.
[03:01:29.016 --> 03:01:34.778]   It is exclusively available through Skyhorse Publishing at Infowars.com and Amazon and
