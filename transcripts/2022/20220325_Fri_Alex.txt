[00:00.000 --> 00:18.360]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:55.280]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, coming down fast, but a mile's above you.
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.120]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday edition. I am back in the saddle and
[01:01.120 --> 01:06.920]  honored to be here. All right, I'll give you an update on the little health thing that's
[01:06.920 --> 01:11.160]  gone the last few days. We come back next segment, but I've gotten a bunch of tests
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.000]  came in. All is good. Mystery was solved. I'll tell you about that next segment when
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.520]  some stations join us. Look, here's the deal. People ask me a lot on the street, but also
[01:23.520 --> 01:29.280]  my family, how are you taking all these attacks and all those demonization, Alex? And my answer
[01:29.280 --> 01:37.240]  is that's the least of our problems. Major World War, economic collapse, mass starvation,
[01:37.240 --> 01:43.880]  complete collapse of the third world, flooding the first world. That's the great reset plan.
[01:43.880 --> 01:49.040]  And that's how I keep predicting everything that's happening. So I'm the captain of my
[01:49.040 --> 01:53.920]  own life. I'm trying to get everybody else be the captains of their lives. And I'm really
[01:53.920 --> 02:04.160]  trying to get people to stand up and wake up and get engaged and get involved so that
[02:04.160 --> 02:14.080]  we don't go into a major calamity. If I didn't think we could at least have a safer crash
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.720]  landing, we're crashing for sure. We're already in the middle of it. I wouldn't still be
[02:19.720 --> 02:23.520]  on air. I would have evacuated probably out of the United States. This is going to be
[02:23.520 --> 02:30.760]  the epicenter of an artificial civil war. Everybody else is just rearranging deck chairs
[02:30.760 --> 02:39.320]  on the Titanic. So we're going to be talking about all of this and a lot more here on the
[02:39.320 --> 02:49.760]  broadcast today. But when you see the circus out there of this Supreme Court nominee, who
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.600]  can't say what a woman is, and you see everything else that's happening, know that this is all
[02:55.600 --> 03:03.040]  by design run by very wicked, very evil behavioral psychologists that can only capture us by
[03:03.040 --> 03:09.640]  making us insane. There's a great meme going around. It's got an image of Cabinon and that
[03:09.640 --> 03:13.920]  woman that made up all that crap about him. That's been confirmed. She made it up. A bunch
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.000]  of women have gone to jail that got caught actually telling lies that didn't exist. They
[03:18.000 --> 03:26.080]  were just total frauds. Believe all women were told. And then there's a Republican nominee
[03:26.080 --> 03:34.400]  who's a woman. And then we're told, oh, only some women. And now it's what's a woman with
[03:34.400 --> 03:45.040]  the new Supreme Court nominee. Very, very sick situation. We've got all that to go over.
[03:45.040 --> 03:51.720]  There's also a bunch of news confirming from England to the U.S. of Sweden that they were
[03:51.720 --> 03:55.840]  ordered to kill old people and not give them health care and just give them morphine while
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.480]  they were put on ventilators to kill them with a ventilator because you'd give them morphine
[04:01.480 --> 04:04.920]  or other strong opiates and then put them on a ventilator. It'll kill you. And they knew
[04:04.920 --> 04:09.680]  and gave the order worldwide to kill. That's a pretty big deal. That's mainstream news.
[04:09.680 --> 04:14.800]  They're just reporting it like it's no big deal. And of course, we have the really big
[04:14.800 --> 04:19.840]  news we'll cover right when we come back. The war and the economic collapse that again
[04:19.840 --> 04:26.440]  is orchestrated and Biden saying it's all because of Russia. That's why the gas is exploded.
[04:26.440 --> 04:31.960]  And that's why he says you will have food shortages now. Now, food shortages and massive
[04:31.960 --> 04:37.240]  inflation in the United States means people going bankrupt, people on the street, people
[04:37.240 --> 04:42.320]  moving in with their families, people, you know, dying from stress, trying to make ends
[04:42.320 --> 04:48.640]  meet. But in Africa and in Latin America and in some areas of the Middle East and Asia,
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.120]  that is a death sentence. Because in those countries, there's not welfare. We just starve
[04:53.120 --> 05:01.040]  to death. So we'll talk about when we come back.
[05:01.040 --> 05:09.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[05:09.920 --> 05:14.840]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[05:14.840 --> 05:20.760]  are broken down. And info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[05:20.760 --> 05:25.680]  operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[05:25.680 --> 05:30.440]  their main move. Info wars, it's paradoxical is more popular than ever. It's reaching
[05:30.440 --> 05:35.120]  more people than ever despite the censorship. But because of cost increasing and having
[05:35.120 --> 05:39.280]  to run our own infrastructure, pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running
[05:39.280 --> 05:47.040]  out of money. So listen up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t shirts that
[05:47.040 --> 05:52.760]  help spread the word and fund the operation on supplements, on books, on films, everything
[05:52.760 --> 05:58.960]  is 25 to 75% off right now. The biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com. Thank
[05:58.960 --> 06:02.720]  you for your support.
[06:02.720 --> 06:10.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups, you want to stop tyranny? Well,
[06:10.600 --> 06:23.160]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones. Well, Katanji Brown Jackson
[06:23.160 --> 06:28.160]  can't find her ass with both hands. But you know, that's not really true. She knows good
[06:28.160 --> 06:32.120]  and well we're living in a brainwashed cult. And that you're not allowed to define a woman
[06:32.120 --> 06:36.480]  only the globalists and the biomedical tyranny are because they're putting chemicals in the
[06:36.480 --> 06:45.080]  food and water to make us basically sexless, hemathodetic drones. And of course, I've been
[06:45.080 --> 06:51.160]  telling you for 28 years on air, that's the plan. Because I read the book by the head
[06:51.160 --> 06:56.360]  family running the global eugenics operation that founded the UN, the Huxleys, and they
[06:56.360 --> 07:01.600]  wrote a book in 31 telling you the plan that was fiction called Brave New World and then
[07:01.600 --> 07:06.240]  they wrote a nonfiction he did in 61 when he was dying of cancer. He gave a Berkeley
[07:06.240 --> 07:10.320]  speech you can go read the book and listen to the speech. It's only an hour long where
[07:10.320 --> 07:15.280]  he lays out how this is indeed real and how they're going to do this to you. So I have
[07:15.280 --> 07:20.320]  their damn blueprint. You have their damn blueprint. How do you think I got up here on
[07:20.320 --> 07:27.520]  there and said, you're going to see major war breakout in Asia and in Eastern Europe
[07:27.520 --> 07:32.800]  by late February? Because I have a lot of high level sources and I can also see the
[07:32.800 --> 07:37.720]  propaganda and the movements and things were happening in the military in the corporate
[07:37.720 --> 07:43.840]  world at every level. And now it came out last week that China was looking to invade
[07:43.840 --> 07:52.680]  Taiwan simultaneously but didn't and is now looking to go in this fall. And they just
[07:52.680 --> 07:56.360]  see some more islands today. I mean, all hell is just breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:56.360 --> 08:04.520]  But there's nothing more frustrating, nothing more frustrating than having the globalist
[08:04.520 --> 08:09.400]  battle plan and knowing what cards are in their hand. You don't know what they're going
[08:09.400 --> 08:15.360]  to play next but you know limitedly what they can play. So in a way you do know. And then
[08:15.360 --> 08:21.120]  to just sit here and be attacked by the whole political system constantly trying to put
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.840]  me in jail, constantly trying to suicide of existence, constantly trying to deplatform
[08:25.840 --> 08:31.040]  us and debank us and the rest of it. And I just don't think even the listeners of this
[08:31.040 --> 08:37.160]  show realize that Info Wars is a canary in the coal mine and a real weather vein or
[08:37.160 --> 08:48.920]  bellwether, a gauge, a sensor, a detector of where everybody else is about to be. Just
[08:48.920 --> 08:54.000]  like Trump would always say, they're trying to get through me to get to you and he was
[08:54.000 --> 08:59.480]  absolutely right. And DeSantis makes that same point. Boy, DeSantis just gets better
[08:59.480 --> 09:04.640]  and better by the minute. Better than Trump, I would say, in his policies and what he's
[09:04.640 --> 09:09.080]  up to. But I'm not trying to pick favorites here. At least Trump has shut up about the
[09:09.080 --> 09:16.080]  poison shot and at least isn't pushing it anymore. That's enough for me. But here's
[09:16.080 --> 09:22.880]  the big news, ladies and gentlemen. Whenever Joe Biden came out last week and said we're
[09:22.880 --> 09:34.520]  in a new world order and then he said it again on what Monday and it got a lot of attention.
[09:34.520 --> 09:39.440]  Nobody to listen very, very carefully to what he said. And we're going to play that clip
[09:39.440 --> 09:49.920]  next segment. He was explaining that in his own halting babble that 60 million people
[09:49.920 --> 09:58.080]  were killed in war in World War II. Of course, there's a lot more than 60 million people,
[09:58.080 --> 10:03.480]  but that's a conservative number. And he was explaining that. And he said, then we got
[10:03.480 --> 10:08.080]  a liberal new world order that stopped all that, which that's not true, and that that
[10:08.080 --> 10:14.200]  world order is about to be over and that a new world order is going to be here and that
[10:14.200 --> 10:19.880]  the U.S. is going to lead it. I'll explain what type of new world order they're setting
[10:19.880 --> 10:24.800]  up. And I think you already know it's called the Great Reset. The new headline is all over
[10:24.800 --> 10:29.320]  the news. The Davos Group calls the shots. The media clicks their heels. The academics
[10:29.320 --> 10:35.920]  and government officials click their heels. Bugs now being served on trendy menus at trendy
[10:35.920 --> 10:48.800]  restaurants all over the Western world. Everything from fly larva gravy to mealworm hamburgers.
[10:48.800 --> 10:58.920]  It just gets grosser and grosser because they have to train you to accept the destruction
[10:58.920 --> 11:03.960]  of all that is good and decent and that your instincts tell you is good and decent. They
[11:03.960 --> 11:09.160]  want you to go against your instincts. We've also got that here in Austin with this elementary
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.440]  school that locks the children in so parents can't get in and then teaches them how to
[11:13.440 --> 11:18.040]  use sex toys. We're talking about five, six, seven, eight, nine-year-olds, and then has
[11:18.040 --> 11:25.880]  them march around in basically rainbow gangster attire as they are inducted into the pedophilic
[11:25.880 --> 11:32.320]  sex cult. And even, again, Bill Maher says it's wrong to be sexualizing children. This
[11:32.320 --> 11:41.400]  is exactly the laws that DeSantis is trying to pass to keep these groomers away from your
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.840]  children because at the bottom of the barrel, the Democratic Party, is a sexualization of
[11:46.840 --> 11:50.160]  children. Look at this video out of middle school here in Austin or elementary school.
[11:50.160 --> 11:57.720]  Excuse me. The children wearing masks as their prisoners in the cult, going around and worshiping
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.520]  and discussing how wonderful it is to have sex with the same sex. Imagine if a mom and
[12:03.520 --> 12:07.240]  dad were just teaching five-year-olds or six-year-olds or seven-year-olds or eight-year-olds. Those
[12:07.240 --> 12:10.720]  parents are perverts. They're weirdos. Kids aren't thinking about those type of things.
[12:10.720 --> 12:20.480]  This is pure imprinting, pure grooming. We've got all the leftists going into the big city
[12:20.480 --> 12:26.520]  councils and congressional hearings saying, we are grooming your children. We are going
[12:26.520 --> 12:36.520]  to get your children. They are ours now. You have these whacked-out zombies teaching them
[12:36.520 --> 12:41.160]  all this and then getting the children to say who they're attracted to sexually and
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.920]  then filling it out and giving papers to the teacher so they can then encourage them and
[12:44.920 --> 12:48.480]  have them get up in front of the class and say, I'm a five-year-old boy and I like boys.
[12:48.480 --> 12:53.400]  Well, of course, you like boys when you're a boy as in want to play with them. You don't
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.880]  understand what they're saying. Girls like girls, too. They're trying to confuse them,
[12:58.880 --> 13:07.520]  create a definition in the school system towards transgenderism and sterilization. Whoa, ladies
[13:07.520 --> 13:12.160]  and gentlemen, whether it's heterosexual or homosexual, all of it is pedophilic and evil.
[13:12.160 --> 13:16.720]  That's coming up as well. Also, the left celebrating Clarence Thomas being sick and now going after
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.360]  his wife saying they need to have her arrested for the insurrection. Congress has her text
[13:22.360 --> 13:25.600]  messages and is having much of fun where she said, hey, let's fight them still in this
[13:25.600 --> 13:30.160]  election. Hey, you're not allowed to say you're going to say no to us. Democrats said they
[13:30.160 --> 13:33.000]  were going to challenge the election no matter what happened and wouldn't accept the results
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.200]  and then they were going to have their own inauguration and would even have a civil war.
[13:36.200 --> 13:41.560]  The New York Times said the Democrats war game with Hillary and Obama and Biden and
[13:41.560 --> 13:46.560]  John Podesta. That was in the New York Times that they were going to have a physical war,
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.240]  but then she, Clarence Thomas' wife, who is a patriot, sent text messages to the White
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.680]  House, even staff saying, hey, you need to challenge this fraud. You need to politically
[13:56.680 --> 14:04.040]  do this. Help dare her talk in America about challenging an election. They got all that
[14:04.040 --> 14:14.120]  coming up. Man, it's a crazy time in America. There's also some other news that I haven't
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.720]  gotten. We really haven't talked about it in depth. We talked about briefly yesterday
[14:17.720 --> 14:23.000]  and he's a tough guy. She doesn't care, but we do need to talk about it. We need to make
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.600]  a big deal about it. Don't we finally get around to it? The Fed's called about Owen
[14:30.600 --> 14:38.320]  and they said something really evil, really unprecedented and they concede. The Democrats
[14:38.320 --> 14:40.920]  in the deep state believe they have a free hand with America. They can make any crime
[14:40.920 --> 14:51.240]  they want, do anything they want. It's pretty incredible how they operate. At some point
[14:51.240 --> 14:54.920]  here in the next few days, maybe Monday or so, I'll tell you, I'm sure you want to talk
[14:54.920 --> 15:02.400]  about it, about what the feds called up his lawyer and said. You probably imagine what
[15:02.400 --> 15:08.760]  they said, but I guess they really just misjudged all of us and who we are. We're not people
[15:08.760 --> 15:17.160]  like them, mafia type individuals, but this country is in terminal collapse right now.
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.600]  We'll come back with Biden bragging about it and saying it's going to be really painful.
[15:20.600 --> 15:25.280]  There will be mass food shortages and starvation worldwide. It's already happening. It's all
[15:25.280 --> 15:28.360]  Russia's fault. It's not the great recess, not the lockdown. I didn't tell you. Probably
[15:28.360 --> 15:32.960]  2,000 times the last 26 months this would happen right around this time. No, no, it's
[15:32.960 --> 15:37.760]  all Russia. That's right. Now we're going to watch hundreds of millions of Africans die
[15:37.760 --> 15:44.080]  but that's okay. Just don't use the n-word. Okay. You can kill all the black people you
[15:44.080 --> 15:50.160]  want. Just don't use that magic n-word. Don't be looking for all the cool black hip hop
[15:50.160 --> 15:59.720]  stars and rappers. Everybody talk about actual murder of Africans.
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air and
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.600]  on the ground. I need your help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born
[16:09.600 --> 16:14.120]  for this. You were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had
[16:14.120 --> 16:19.080]  to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.320]  tens of millions of dollars. And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million
[16:23.320 --> 16:28.720]  views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.560]  able to post their content free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's
[16:34.560 --> 16:41.040]  a catch-22. Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human
[16:41.040 --> 16:46.400]  liberty movement worldwide. But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.840]  a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in
[16:50.840 --> 16:55.720]  info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off,
[16:55.720 --> 17:02.240]  making incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever. If I had to describe with
[17:02.240 --> 17:11.160]  just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general
[17:11.160 --> 17:17.680]  public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost. Just like you're
[17:17.680 --> 17:22.680]  lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out and
[17:22.680 --> 17:30.880]  you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion
[17:30.880 --> 17:35.800]  and that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us into
[17:35.800 --> 17:39.960]  a position of not knowing our bearings. And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave
[17:39.960 --> 17:44.560]  him a speech he called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.280]  the culture in the media has been driven to make sure that people are all alone so they
[17:49.280 --> 17:53.800]  can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the great reset is. They
[17:53.800 --> 18:00.280]  need darkness to thrive. The light lives at info wars.com. Mike in California, thanks
[18:00.280 --> 18:04.240]  for calling. I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function
[18:04.240 --> 18:09.160]  research. Now, if you read the actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the US government
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.640]  gain of function, deliberative process and research funding pause on selected gain of
[18:14.640 --> 18:19.080]  function research involving influenza, MERS and SARS virus. There's nothing about SARS
[18:19.080 --> 18:23.960]  like viruses and it's a research funding pause. It's not a stop. It's not a prohibition.
[18:23.960 --> 18:28.120]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stops on you stop, you look both
[18:28.120 --> 18:32.720]  ways and then you proceed. And so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function, just
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.160]  selected gain of function, but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[18:37.160 --> 18:41.680]  qualification research. So, you know, Rand and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[18:41.680 --> 18:44.760]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function. You know,
[18:44.760 --> 18:47.960]  that's why he didn't perjure himself. That's why he hasn't been arrested because they're
[18:47.960 --> 18:52.320]  literally creating new synthetic life forms that mimic what the viruses do. But in the
[18:52.320 --> 18:56.480]  main definition, it's still a gain of function. You're making something deadly that spreads
[18:56.480 --> 19:00.280]  more easily to hurt people. Thank you, Mike. We love you. The average person on the face
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.440]  of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between three individuals
[19:05.440 --> 19:10.320]  and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other, who are literally trying to
[19:10.320 --> 19:15.240]  create a post human world for the United States of Brazil, and of course triggered by the
[19:15.240 --> 19:20.800]  Brexit in the UK. Nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[19:20.800 --> 19:26.240]  That's why they launched their great reset and their program after collapsing us of build
[19:26.240 --> 19:33.720]  back better. This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy
[19:33.720 --> 19:38.280]  because they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is
[19:38.280 --> 19:43.640]  the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win. They released a biological weapon
[19:43.640 --> 19:49.640]  on us. Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago. It's that simple.
[19:49.640 --> 19:54.040]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns. So the global corporate combine
[19:54.040 --> 20:01.080]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of history. Expose this paradigm and we win.
[20:01.080 --> 20:30.040]  So the puppet president of the United States, Joe Biden, at the snap NATO summit he calls
[20:30.040 --> 20:36.640]  he can grandstand around the war and try to boost his approval ratings has blamed ladies
[20:36.640 --> 20:43.920]  and gentlemen, the Russians for the food price increases and the inflation. When it's the
[20:43.920 --> 20:50.040]  private central banks of the US, the European Union, China and Japan has been absolutely
[20:50.040 --> 20:56.280]  horrible as well. Massively monetizing debt and just turning the printing presses up.
[20:56.280 --> 21:01.600]  Even for 40 years and the US has accelerated it as you know, the last 20 or so and so is
[21:01.600 --> 21:07.040]  China. There's been a race and people just keep getting all this money. Now the inflation
[21:07.040 --> 21:15.720]  is kicking in and oh, oh, it's Vladimir. It's Vladimir Putin's fault. Here it is.
[21:15.720 --> 21:20.480]  Nothing more to report with regard to food shortages. Yes, we didn't. We talked about
[21:20.480 --> 21:27.760]  food shortages and it's going to be real. The price of these sanctions is not just imposed
[21:27.760 --> 21:33.760]  upon Russia. It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries
[21:33.760 --> 21:41.960]  and our country as well. So again, let's play that one more time and let that sink in on
[21:41.960 --> 21:46.360]  the food situation. Go ahead and play it again. Nothing more to report with regard to food
[21:46.360 --> 21:53.240]  shortages. Yes, we didn't. We talked about food shortages and it's going to be real.
[21:53.240 --> 21:59.440]  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia. It's imposed upon an awful lot
[21:59.440 --> 22:05.760]  of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.560]  Which of course is true. When you cut off the second largest fertilizer supplier in
[22:11.560 --> 22:17.120]  the world, when you cut off the second largest oil supplier in the world, it's going to cause
[22:17.120 --> 22:24.200]  even bigger problems on top of the inflation that was already accelerating and we all know
[22:24.200 --> 22:29.080]  that and there's national polls out. Over 70 percent of Americans know it's Joe Biden.
[22:29.080 --> 22:32.920]  It's the globalist. But do they know it's by design? Do they know it's part of the great
[22:32.920 --> 22:39.520]  reset? I have a clip here. In fact, let's skip to this clip. Let's play clip 17. This
[22:39.520 --> 22:46.200]  is Biden says this crisis also presents an opportunity for investment and clean energy.
[22:46.200 --> 22:49.880]  And what does the head of the energy department said? What does the head of the Department
[22:49.880 --> 22:54.280]  of Transportation said? What have they all said? They've all said, oh, we could lower
[22:54.280 --> 23:00.520]  gas prices. We could lower electricity prices. We've chosen not to to make you transition
[23:00.520 --> 23:06.160]  off fossil fuel. The windmills don't work. The solar panels break. They use as much carbon
[23:06.160 --> 23:11.960]  to produce them as they ever basically gain. It's all a scam. They have enough coal to
[23:11.960 --> 23:16.280]  go for thousands of years and it's good for the environment. It's good. It creates carbon
[23:16.280 --> 23:25.360]  dioxide plants brief. But it doesn't matter because they want to depopulate. Oh, look,
[23:25.360 --> 23:33.400]  Jeff Bezos's wife just gave hundreds of millions of dollars specifically earmarking abortions
[23:33.400 --> 23:38.320]  of black babies. Oh, but they're liberal. They gave money to Black Lives Matter, whose
[23:38.320 --> 23:44.080]  main mission is ending the nuclear family and getting black men to turn trans and have
[23:44.080 --> 23:51.160]  their penises and testicles removed. Folks, that's official. They really don't like black
[23:51.160 --> 23:56.200]  people. And what's the average black male like? He's just like a liberal white. He's
[23:56.200 --> 24:03.000]  out there going on political correctness out there. I saw some comedian at Joe's club
[24:03.000 --> 24:10.120]  where he is a resident set at Vulcan Gas Company getting his face and I can say, how dare you
[24:10.120 --> 24:13.440]  use the N word and all this stuff when Joe invited him there to be there just to try
[24:13.440 --> 24:19.520]  to, you know, act like a stud or act cool. And I guarantee you talked to that guy about
[24:19.520 --> 24:24.560]  targeting black babies for abortion or the world starvation, mainly of Africans under
[24:24.560 --> 24:28.600]  this plan. He doesn't care. He just wants to get points with the corporate media and
[24:28.600 --> 24:34.000]  the system. I may even play that clip a little bit later. Pat Riley was showing it to me
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.880]  the other day and I forgot to send it to Scott. I call Riley and get him to send it to you.
[24:38.880 --> 24:44.800]  He's got the clip. And again, it's this holier than thou attitude like, oh, you're a white
[24:44.800 --> 24:51.040]  person. So you're bad. The liberal corporate media told me so who wants us all divided
[24:51.040 --> 24:55.440]  and conquered and killing each other and all basing our ideas on race. So we never base
[24:55.440 --> 25:03.200]  it on liberty and freedom and a code that lifts us all up until they turn minorities
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.760]  out of the majority worldwide. 90% of the world's not white into white hating bigots.
[25:10.760 --> 25:15.500]  And then the globalists have the world set for where it wants to go. Planetary, racial
[25:15.500 --> 25:21.360]  division and control. We were all like a big prison. We had the blacks, the Hispanics and
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.840]  the whites and every group's racially based and the warden controls everyone by race.
[25:26.840 --> 25:32.640]  And we are a prison planet controlled by racial manipulation and LGBT brainwashing designed
[25:32.640 --> 25:37.400]  to screw up our children. Absolutely cold blooded, absolutely evil. And you've got
[25:37.400 --> 25:42.440]  a soul. You've got to reject the whole thing and say no to it. This is not. I don't say
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.760]  this to curry favor with the LGBT people. I says this is the truth. I don't hate someone
[25:47.760 --> 25:53.720]  because they like the same sex as an adult. I hate the agenda of targeting children period
[25:53.720 --> 25:59.120]  and the whole quote gay agenda being globalist, being anti-gun, anti-family, and being signed
[25:59.120 --> 26:03.880]  on to dehumanization and transhumanism. Keep your dirty, evil hands off children. I don't
[26:03.880 --> 26:09.240]  care if you're a heterosexual pedophile or a homosexual pedophile, you need to go to
[26:09.240 --> 26:14.000]  prison. Continuing. I mean, it's not even a Trojan horse anymore. They're not even
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.280]  hiding that the gay agenda is really a pedophile agenda now. And so we need people who've been
[26:19.280 --> 26:25.120]  pro-LGBT like Bill Maher to come out against it and say, keep your hands off the kids.
[26:25.120 --> 26:29.160]  What the hell is your problem? And then he gets shouted down because this is driven by
[26:29.160 --> 26:39.320]  a pedophile. The LGBT bus is driven by a pedophile, period. But again, it's about cutting the
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.160]  resources off while dividing us, conquering us and getting rid of the family because it's
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.040]  a strong institution where people owe allegiance to that family. It's the original gang and
[26:49.040 --> 26:54.400]  replacing it with gangs of whites and blacks and Asians and Hispanics and this and that
[26:54.400 --> 27:02.000]  and Muslim and Christian and gay and straight and this and that all divided into gangs,
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.080]  gang rule, fascism, all these separate groups tied together in the broken coalition strategy.
[27:09.080 --> 27:13.720]  Whereas Biden talking about the crisis also presents an opportunity. This crisis also
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.040]  presents an opportunity. It's a catalyst, a catalyst that will drive the investments
[27:19.040 --> 27:24.960]  we need to double down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our net
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.520]  zero emissions future. That's what the second part of this initiative is all about. The
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.120]  United States and the European Union are going to work together to take concrete measures
[27:35.120 --> 27:45.560]  to reduce dependence on natural gas, period. So, oh, natural gas burns basically clean.
[27:45.560 --> 27:50.040]  They don't care. They want it gone. Everything's got to go. You see, because you're being put
[27:50.040 --> 27:54.640]  into feudalism, you're being put to serve them while they're above the law and do whatever
[27:54.640 --> 27:59.160]  they want, however they want in any way they want. I got to play the short clip. This is
[27:59.160 --> 28:04.760]  Biden asked about World War Three. This is how moronic the press is and warmongering.
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.040]  They even make the Crip Keeper look smart. Here it is.
[28:09.040 --> 28:12.680]  Cecilia ABC. There you are.
[28:12.680 --> 28:20.880]  Sir, you've made it very clear in this conflict that you do not want to see World War Three.
[28:20.880 --> 28:26.680]  But is it possible that in expressing that so early that you were too quick to rule out
[28:26.680 --> 28:32.040]  direct military intervention in this war, could Putin have been emboldened knowing that
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.560]  you were not going to get involved directly in this conflict?
[28:35.560 --> 28:36.560]  No and no.
[28:36.560 --> 28:39.240]  You should not believe that.
[28:39.240 --> 28:42.240]  And there's many layers of lies there. We'll come back and get to that and get to his New
[28:42.240 --> 28:46.000]  World Order comment that I said I'd get to this segment. But I'm sure you pick up on
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.120]  the layers of lies there, though. Part of what he says is true. The rest is a lie. The U.S.
[28:50.120 --> 28:53.800]  is directly involved with Russia. We're at war with Russia. They didn't war with Russia
[28:53.800 --> 28:59.560]  for eight years. We'll be right back.
[28:59.560 --> 29:04.120]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it. It's just true that Info Wars
[29:04.120 --> 29:12.200]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[29:12.200 --> 29:19.800]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program. And man, our work is really right
[29:19.800 --> 29:24.960]  now hitting the most important aspects of what you've ever done. So I'm asking listeners
[29:24.960 --> 29:31.840]  now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at InfoWarsTour.com. And we are funded
[29:31.840 --> 29:36.800]  by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever because
[29:36.800 --> 29:41.960]  this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at InfoWarsTour.com. We've
[29:41.960 --> 29:47.560]  got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long time
[29:47.560 --> 29:52.840]  like Info Wars Life, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's so amazing, and our new immune support
[29:52.840 --> 29:59.920]  formula that's so critical, they're all available 25 to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com right now.
[29:59.920 --> 30:04.520]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed
[30:04.520 --> 30:10.400]  major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[30:10.400 --> 30:15.240]  of New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[30:15.240 --> 30:21.360]  and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household teaching
[30:21.360 --> 30:25.600]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is
[30:25.600 --> 30:30.400]  a bad thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my
[30:30.400 --> 30:33.880]  four natural daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well.
[30:33.880 --> 30:38.320]  I love to make breakfast. And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for
[30:38.320 --> 30:43.720]  your family and be nurtured and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[30:43.720 --> 30:49.880]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[30:49.880 --> 30:54.880]  are coming together. They really are. Sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will
[30:54.880 --> 30:59.640]  domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[30:59.640 --> 31:07.640]  Introducing the newest product from InfoWarsLife.com. We are so proud of InfoWarsLife immune support.
[31:07.640 --> 31:13.840]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural
[31:13.840 --> 31:19.560]  defenses. Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get.

[31:43.400 --> 31:48.880]  operation. It is a 360 win. The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this
[31:48.880 --> 31:53.440]  product to boost your body's natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air. The globalists
[31:53.440 --> 31:58.040]  are hoping you don't take action. Take action now. InfoWarsStore.com.
[31:58.040 --> 32:05.040]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming. They're here all over the world from Australia to
[32:05.040 --> 32:09.080]  the United States from Canada to Germany. These tyrants are tracking everything you
[32:09.080 --> 32:13.560]  do everywhere you go and then coming to your house and threatening in some cases actually
[32:13.560 --> 32:18.840]  taking people away into the night to their facilities. And they're planning in the next
[32:18.840 --> 32:23.720]  year to expand their shield process where they come and take, quote, healthy people
[32:23.720 --> 32:27.560]  away and put them in facilities for their safety. This is nothing less than martial
[32:27.560 --> 32:32.440]  law. And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages,
[32:32.440 --> 32:36.280]  many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government
[32:36.280 --> 32:41.880]  military grade at InfoWarsStore.com. We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to
[32:41.880 --> 32:47.440]  ship to you when you visit InfoWarsStore.com. Again, we have big backpacks. We have special

[33:01.480 --> 33:13.000]  Taking a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:13.000 --> 33:37.080]  All right, we're back. And I'm going to get into the situation the world's facing, not
[33:37.080 --> 33:41.680]  to scare you, but so you can get prepared. And I think most of the listeners understand
[33:41.680 --> 33:47.680]  now that you don't have to just go off my predictions and think, well, maybe he's going
[33:47.680 --> 33:52.720]  to be right. We're now living the financial collapse. We're living the economic collapse.
[33:52.720 --> 33:58.720]  We are living the food infrastructure collapse. We are living through our energy being purposely
[33:58.720 --> 34:04.680]  turned off. And things are going to get very rough in America and Europe and places like
[34:04.680 --> 34:11.080]  Japan. And in areas like China, they're going to have even bigger problems for the first
[34:11.080 --> 34:16.440]  world. And then in the third world, it is going to be an absolute death sentence for
[34:16.440 --> 34:21.240]  hundreds and hundreds of millions of people. And that information is not even being denied
[34:21.240 --> 34:28.760]  now by the very globalist that are orchestrating this. So when you talk about evil, these people
[34:28.760 --> 34:35.080]  are killing way more than Hitler and Mao, who are the two biggest killers in history,
[34:35.080 --> 34:41.320]  Lenin and Stalin are close third and fourths. But China killed 100 million other people,
[34:41.320 --> 34:47.400]  they admit. Hitler was responsible for the death and killing of 30 million people overall.
[34:47.400 --> 34:52.000]  Even more if you count the Germans that died. And then you got Lenin and Stalin close, as
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.520]  I said, third and fourth places. This is not a game, ladies and gentlemen. And so, oh,
[34:57.520 --> 35:01.760]  but they're dying by starvation, so it's okay. And the IMF and World Bank give the orders
[35:01.760 --> 35:06.200]  to those countries, you'll get millions of dollars that the dictators and corrupt politicians
[35:06.200 --> 35:13.360]  get if you cut the medicine off and cut the food off. So it's just unbelievable. And,
[35:13.360 --> 35:16.880]  you know, the attitude by basketball team owners and stuff, about 3 million people in
[35:16.880 --> 35:21.080]  death camps, hundreds of thousands being killed every few months, they confirm. They're like,
[35:21.080 --> 35:27.560]  I don't even care. The Uighurs don't even register to me. I'm a liberal, the guy says.
[35:27.560 --> 35:34.880]  So I give 10 million dollars to Black Lives Matter. And so I've bought my ticket to be
[35:34.880 --> 35:41.280]  able to engage and support genocide. Because basketball is even bigger in China than it
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.520]  is here. They make most their money in China now. And this guy is literally banking and
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.200]  working and getting products made by people in death camps. And then he says, screw them.
[35:51.200 --> 35:54.560]  I don't even think about them. They don't even enter my mind. I'm trying to get this
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.640]  through to everybody. That's who we're up against. And they've converted. Most of democratic
[35:59.640 --> 36:04.640]  party voters are like that now. The judges, most of them are like that. The pundits on
[36:04.640 --> 36:09.880]  TV, they know they're evil. They know they're bad. They know they're taking our speech.
[36:09.880 --> 36:15.480]  They know they're preparing to criminalize being a nationalist or a patriot. And it's
[36:15.480 --> 36:27.240]  the same program worldwide. So this is it. It's not coming. It's here. And they are
[36:27.240 --> 36:33.480]  searing our conscience right now when they have the owners of basketball teams saying
[36:33.480 --> 36:38.800]  millions in death camps doesn't even register. They don't even make it on my radar screen,
[36:38.800 --> 36:44.480]  he said. Now let me ask you, do you feel safe when hundreds of millions of people are getting
[36:44.480 --> 36:48.720]  set to die from starvation? Already 40 plus million in the last two years. That's a low
[36:48.720 --> 36:53.160]  number extra died. That's 40 freaking million people. Because I'm going to just say, do
[36:53.160 --> 36:57.680]  you feel safe with an elite running things that on purpose just did that? Because maybe
[36:57.680 --> 37:04.680]  you think there's too many Africans. Maybe you're a eugenicist. But I'm going to ask
[37:04.680 --> 37:09.440]  you a question. Do you think you're safe when that type of stuff is going on? Because I'll
[37:09.440 --> 37:13.840]  assure you, nobody is. I don't care if you're a billionaire. I don't care if you work at
[37:13.840 --> 37:21.360]  a shoe store. This isn't good. I'm going to stop right there. I'll get into Biden. And
[37:21.360 --> 37:27.360]  I'll get into all the things that are unfolding. Coming up next segment and I'm going to open
[37:27.360 --> 37:33.080]  the phones up in the second and third hour. Roger Stones be popping in some of the third
[37:33.080 --> 37:41.040]  hour as well. And I want to get into the new world order and the starvation and what it
[37:41.040 --> 37:44.160]  really means. I'm already kind of getting into it, but I want to spend the next segments
[37:44.160 --> 37:48.520]  the longest segment of the hour on that. I want to cover a few things concerning info
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.160]  wars and independent media and how this ties into the bigger picture that we're looking
[37:53.160 --> 38:00.120]  at here and respond to the big national news story. Basically, thousands of local TV stations
[38:00.120 --> 38:06.600]  ran the story. National news all ran it from ABC News to CNN, the New York Times, the Washington
[38:06.600 --> 38:17.040]  Post, local newspaper. Alex Jones could be arrested for not going to deposition. And
[38:17.040 --> 38:22.520]  then they're, oh, he's faking an illness. He's lying. Ladies and gentlemen, I said yesterday
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.360]  and something I recorded from home that they changed the deposition times on us five times.
[38:26.360 --> 38:30.840]  It was more like eight times. They did it last minute. We didn't go to the judge. We
[38:30.840 --> 38:35.960]  didn't complain because it's just what they do. And then I had a mystery illness. We couldn't
[38:35.960 --> 38:42.520]  figure out what it was. I finally found out last night and it wasn't what people thought.
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.400]  And the doctors are like, hey, your health comes first. Go to these tests. And I found
[38:47.400 --> 38:51.400]  out about it on Monday. Wasn't sure. Got a little worse on Tuesday. Went ahead and said,
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.680]  okay, I'm going to go get these tests. And I went and got scans in the, what are you
[38:56.680 --> 39:03.480]  calling, the electrodes all over you, the EKGs and 16 ampoules of blood taken. Went to a
[39:03.480 --> 39:08.640]  couple of clinics, places got checked in. Got some more tests coming up next week. And
[39:08.640 --> 39:13.380]  then boom, one of the doctors finally figured it out. They go, you're not dizzy because
[39:13.380 --> 39:17.840]  of high blood pressure, which I don't have. It's not your heart. Your heart's actually
[39:17.840 --> 39:22.240]  really good shape for somebody overweight like you at your age. They said the right
[39:22.240 --> 39:25.760]  side of my heart's a little bit bigger than the other side, but that's classic with somebody
[39:25.760 --> 39:28.920]  with sleep apnea, but it's not that enlarged. It's a little bit on one side. Don't let you
[39:28.920 --> 39:32.080]  know my medical stuff. You're not going to charts and all that. They said it's a really
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.800]  good heart for even a normal 48 year old person. It's like, it looks like a 20 year olds, but
[39:35.800 --> 39:38.320]  it's a little bit bigger on this side. Yeah, that's the sleep apnea because they asked me
[39:38.320 --> 39:41.800]  in the questionnaire and then even predicted that my right side would be a little bit bigger.
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.840]  And then finally, they're like, Hey, have you taken some Clarenin D? Have you? And then
[39:47.840 --> 39:54.080]  they like sort of checking sent me to another doctor and I had a blockage in my sinus and
[39:54.080 --> 39:59.600]  when it finally came out last night, blood and pus and oh, I felt so much better because
[39:59.600 --> 40:06.920]  Marble's in here on Monday and I'm dizzy and I'm sweating and I say, Yeah, I've been dizzy
[40:06.920 --> 40:10.960]  for a couple of days. It comes and goes. He goes, Well, you're back to be your heart.
[40:10.960 --> 40:14.520]  And you need to, you know, you need to go to the doctor right now. And then he was predicting,
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.840]  you know, well, you're kind of a little bit overweight, you're stressed. I bet you need
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.240]  a stint in your heart and all that stuff. He's a great guy. But I was like, Whoa, you really?
[40:21.240 --> 40:26.080]  And so I was dizzy. You probably noticed last week, I was sniffling a lot. Every time
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.520]  I go to LA stuff like this happens. I went to LA, I was there, stopped up the whole time,
[40:31.520 --> 40:34.960]  couldn't figure it out what was going on, got a netty pot, tried that and then it just
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.240]  made a middle ear type deal where I was just like, Whoa, half the day, like I was on the
[40:40.240 --> 40:45.640]  deck of a ship. And he thought that was my heart. So that's what happened. That's what's
[40:45.640 --> 40:50.400]  going on. And I feel like a new person wants this blockage and I want to get graphic here.
[40:50.400 --> 40:55.120]  But you know, it was disgusting blood. Plus, I mean, we're talking to probably three ounces
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.960]  of it came out of my left nostril. And so that's the big story. That's what happened. And of
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.480]  course they're like, you're dizzy, you're sweating, you can't go to this. I've sat for
[41:06.480 --> 41:10.920]  three of these things. I've been basically anally probed by these people. They've gotten
[41:10.920 --> 41:15.120]  everything a blueprint to try to destroy us. They admit that's their plan. And then they
[41:15.120 --> 41:19.680]  default us and say, we've done nothing. And then I have a medical issue and tell them
[41:19.680 --> 41:24.800]  and they say they want me arrested. That's who these people are. It's a Democratic party
[41:24.800 --> 41:30.640]  mafia that uses dead children as their pretext to attack the second and first amendment,
[41:30.640 --> 41:37.960]  ladies and gentlemen. And it is preposterous, absolutely preposterous. But I'm glad I went
[41:37.960 --> 41:41.320]  and got these medical tests. And if you want to get completely graphic, everybody asked
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.040]  why I have gravelly voice. I scream and yell a lot on bullhorn. So the ears didn't have
[41:45.040 --> 41:51.280]  voice lessons tore up my throat. And I've got some polyps on my larynx and another one
[41:51.280 --> 41:55.520]  on the larynx up here that I'm going to have to get surgery on at some point. But I won't
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.200]  be able to be on air for two weeks when I do it. So I got that to deal with. I mean,
[42:00.200 --> 42:04.800]  since we're all obsessed with my medical stuff, let's just get it all out there. Don't have
[42:04.800 --> 42:12.200]  any hemorrhoids, don't have any hangnails. Got 60 beats per minute. I've got the blood
[42:12.200 --> 42:22.600]  pressure of a 25 year old. And so I got good genetics. But I'm on antibiotics and feeling
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.280]  a lot better with this whole nasal situation. So there we are. That's where we're at. And
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.160]  so I'm done talking about it. But man, the response of those people and the craziness
[42:33.160 --> 42:38.560]  and how they've weaponized the judiciary and how I'm supposed to be destroyed and the people
[42:38.560 --> 42:42.400]  involved, the judges, the lawyers, all of them are primping for the media and writing
[42:42.400 --> 42:46.240]  books and making money and getting off on it. And it's just disgusting. And then accusing
[42:46.240 --> 42:51.120]  me of living off those dead kids. No, it's that whole group of Democrats and lawyers
[42:51.120 --> 42:54.880]  and people they live off of them. Folks up in Connecticut run like a cult around those
[42:54.880 --> 43:03.440]  kids. You know, it's a fact. And I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[43:03.440 --> 43:11.480]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[43:11.480 --> 43:19.040]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program. And man, our work is really
[43:19.040 --> 43:24.360]  right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done. So I'm asking listeners
[43:24.360 --> 43:30.360]  now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info wars tour.com. And we are
[43:30.360 --> 43:35.960]  funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever
[43:35.960 --> 43:41.360]  because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at info wars tour.com.
[43:41.360 --> 43:46.520]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long
[43:46.520 --> 43:52.240]  time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support
[43:52.240 --> 43:58.560]  formula that's so critical. They're all available 25 to 75% off and info wars store.com right
[43:58.560 --> 44:06.480]  now. There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class,
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.320]  not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere. Is there
[44:12.320 --> 44:18.120]  a real study of the planet's ruling class? And that's done by design. The large central
[44:18.120 --> 44:23.840]  banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look
[44:23.840 --> 44:28.840]  into say the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg group, the trilateral
[44:28.840 --> 44:33.560]  commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[44:33.560 --> 44:37.800]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media, the Bilderberg group didn't
[44:37.800 --> 44:43.040]  exist. Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head. Still on the steering
[44:43.040 --> 44:48.320]  committee is Klaus Schwab. And he has set up the great reset in global government. And
[44:48.320 --> 44:53.400]  if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on about the second
[44:53.400 --> 44:57.600]  thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot. We do expose
[44:57.600 --> 45:05.000]  them, we can beat a measly. The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol
[45:05.000 --> 45:10.960]  of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combined controlled by the
[45:10.960 --> 45:17.920]  global private corporations has put in place. It is the symbol of the permanent emergency
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.480]  from which we will never emerge. It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and
[45:22.480 --> 45:30.320]  bad and must cover a disease criminal faces from the light of the sun. It is the symbol
[45:30.320 --> 45:38.360]  of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil. Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing
[45:38.360 --> 45:44.560]  the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us. Klaus Schwab and the
[45:44.560 --> 45:48.720]  UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon
[45:48.720 --> 45:54.600]  taxes. Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better if we resist
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.520]  and say no. Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.

[47:00.560 --> 47:18.160]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:18.160 --> 47:32.560]  Back in the saddle. Broadcast worldwide on this Friday, March 25th, 2022, transmission.
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.480]  One other big show note here on the Alex Jones show. I almost always, when I say I'm doing
[47:37.480 --> 47:42.560]  a special live broadcast, I almost always end up doing it. But obviously because of
[47:42.560 --> 47:47.560]  the vertigo and the rest of it from the sinus infection, I didn't do that Wednesday as I
[47:47.560 --> 47:54.240]  said I wouldn't. I apologize for that or Tuesday. But I will do a three hour live show. Excuse
[47:54.240 --> 48:02.080]  me. I will do a three hour live show tomorrow, commercial free. By that, we're not going
[48:02.080 --> 48:06.840]  to go to regular breaks like a radio or TV clock. We'll play a few breaks for me to go
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.800]  to the bathroom or get up and get a cup of coffee or whatever. But we're going to do
[48:10.800 --> 48:17.520]  a three hour special show live from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. tomorrow. We're going to have a
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.040]  surprise special guest as well. And we're going to take your calls. And I'm also going
[48:23.040 --> 48:29.680]  to take your calls next hour and in the third hour as well. And we have Roger Stone on the
[48:29.680 --> 48:35.280]  big suit that Trump has filed. It's really a blueprint of how the Democrats engaged in
[48:35.280 --> 48:38.860]  their attempt at coup against Trump and the American people and their whole Russiagate
[48:38.860 --> 48:44.080]  fraud and how the scam worked. Very important to understand and know, even if Democrat judges
[48:44.080 --> 48:49.160]  are probably going to throw the very, very well done, well documented suit out. So we'll
[48:49.160 --> 48:53.760]  be looking at that with Roger Stone's sum in the third hour. I will give the number
[48:53.760 --> 48:59.880]  out here in just a few minutes. We'll fire up the phone system so everybody can call
[48:59.880 --> 49:07.320]  in and give us your take on all of these different situations that are unfolding. Let me get
[49:07.320 --> 49:18.600]  back to this now. The crime against humanity, the mass murder on a scale of which the world
[49:18.600 --> 49:23.760]  has never seen in recorded history has been taking place for two years with the whole
[49:23.760 --> 49:29.240]  COVID mafia takeover with the deadly virus they released, blocking the drugs to treat
[49:29.240 --> 49:34.280]  the virus. It's very easy to treat therapeutics, then giving people the vaccines. That's not
[49:34.280 --> 49:39.280]  a vaccine that actually creates the same thing as a spike protein and colonizes your body
[49:39.280 --> 49:46.520]  with protein crystals. Very similar to what causes mad cow disease or spongiform encephalopathy.
[49:46.520 --> 49:51.920]  The denial of care of old people who needed cancer surgery, heart surgery and others that
[49:51.920 --> 49:56.240]  died by the millions worldwide. It's estimated I've got the articles right here. We'll cover
[49:56.240 --> 50:02.520]  it next hour. The giving old people a host of assisted suicide drugs when they were on
[50:02.520 --> 50:06.440]  ventilators, knowing it kills you when you do that. I mean, I've got the New York Times
[50:06.440 --> 50:15.000]  admitting this here and they're still doing it. That's who these people are. They are
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.400]  normalizing culling off the population, the great culling that Dr. Rima Labo and Dr. General
[50:21.400 --> 50:31.120]  and General Stubblebine were told about 14 years ago when she treated heads of state.
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.120]  He was the former head of the army. He had his connections as well. What did she say
[50:37.120 --> 50:42.200]  in that Jesse Ventura interview with myself and Jesse Ventura on his show? Everything
[50:42.200 --> 50:51.320]  that now happened. We're not late to the game here. We know what's going on. You know what's
[50:51.320 --> 50:57.680]  going on. Everybody better come face to face with the global controlled collapse that's
[50:57.680 --> 51:02.960]  now begun. So when Biden says New World Order and 60 million dead, he means World War II
[51:02.960 --> 51:07.280]  when he's bumbling, and that we didn't have that anymore on the same scale because of
[51:07.280 --> 51:11.760]  the liberal world order, no, they just had Pol Pot and other people do it quietly, the
[51:11.760 --> 51:20.440]  killing, Fidel Castro and countless other dictators, and that now that's all over, but
[51:20.440 --> 51:28.280]  that America will lead the new New World Order, the end of Bretton Woods, a new global currency
[51:28.280 --> 51:34.040]  based on carbon taxes and based on a global social credit score. Build back better. You
[51:34.040 --> 51:38.000]  will have nothing. You will own nothing. You'll like it. You will eat bugs. They announced
[51:38.000 --> 51:42.960]  it five years ago. You laugh at it. I laugh at it. Now, fancy restaurants only to serve
[51:42.960 --> 51:49.440]  bugs. You're like, well, that's crazy. Well, it's getting to the children's brains. They're
[51:49.440 --> 51:57.000]  the real ones being brainwashed. It's a very anti-human takeover taking place. And so there's
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.600]  the headline, bug munching. Soon to be mainstream in Austin. They're never going to stop. They'll
[52:01.600 --> 52:06.880]  be subsidized by banks with free drinks and free everything. Just eat the bugs, be trendy.
[52:06.880 --> 52:13.200]  Just teach pedophilia to children. Just drink your GMO garbage. Drink your aspartame and
[52:13.200 --> 52:20.720]  your Coca-Cola and other drinks in your gums. And, oh, drink your atrazine in the water.
[52:20.720 --> 52:30.800]  All of it is an attack plan. So let's go ahead now and go to Biden talking about the New
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.200]  World Order and why this is so important. You know, we are at an inflection point, I
[52:35.200 --> 52:40.720]  believe, in the world economy, not just the world economy in the world. It occurs every
[52:40.720 --> 52:47.720]  three or four generations. As one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting
[52:47.720 --> 52:57.040]  the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946. And since then, we established
[52:57.040 --> 53:01.680]  a liberal world order, and that hadn't happened in a long while. A lot of people died, but
[53:01.680 --> 53:07.000]  nowhere near the chaos. And now is the time when things are shifting. We're going to be
[53:07.000 --> 53:11.520]  a New World Order out there, and we've got to lead it, and we've got to unite the rest
[53:11.520 --> 53:21.440]  of the free world in doing it. So anyway, so anyway, a true death sentence, breaking
[53:21.440 --> 53:30.880]  Biden warns of incoming food shortages. It's going to be real. Yahoo Finance Biden says
[53:30.880 --> 53:35.560]  to expect real food shortages due to Ukraine war. And yeah, that's going to cause some
[53:35.560 --> 53:39.240]  weak shortages and things, which is a death sentence to Africa. That's the main place
[53:39.240 --> 53:47.800]  it's going to hit. But when you expand on that, what else is going on? You see all of
[53:47.800 --> 54:00.120]  the devaluation of the currencies that have taken place. And then we have again these
[54:00.120 --> 54:04.880]  insane type of statements. ABC journalist unhappy that Biden was too quick to rule out
[54:04.880 --> 54:10.240]  World War three. This is when you get such domesticated, dumb down people. They have
[54:10.240 --> 54:20.320]  no idea how anything works. That's why they tell you, Oh, well, we're just going to get
[54:20.320 --> 54:27.120]  our electricity from power plants that don't have any carbon in it. And they don't even
[54:27.120 --> 54:37.120]  care. They don't even know that it takes more carbon to charge up an electric car than
[54:37.120 --> 54:41.480]  gasoline creates, which is I think we should create more carbon. I'm all for electric cars.
[54:41.480 --> 54:46.920]  If you realize it's coming from coal mainly and natural gas, windmills can't power 5%
[54:46.920 --> 54:50.880]  of the country. Spain is bankrupt now because they tried it doesn't work. And they know
[54:50.880 --> 54:56.920]  it doesn't work. It's meant to collapse society. I've got mainstream articles here out of
[54:56.920 --> 55:06.960]  the New York Times, CNN and MSNBC saying working out is bad. And it's racist. And it's what
[55:06.960 --> 55:12.120]  white people do. And they say because it's empowering and teaches you that you're strong
[55:12.120 --> 55:16.880]  and have brotherhood and sisterhood, and you meet a community of people that they don't
[55:16.880 --> 55:20.600]  politically control. Because this is a gym, gyms to be liberal, they can be conservative,
[55:20.600 --> 55:25.520]  they can be neutral. It's not LGBT pedophile. It's not black. It's not white. It's a place
[55:25.520 --> 55:30.640]  where people come together and are friends. And so, oh my God, they want those restricted.
[55:30.640 --> 55:38.680]  I've got that article here in my stack. How it's the new evil thing. It's the new bad
[55:38.680 --> 55:43.600]  thing. That's coming up next hour as well. MSNBC piece claims health and fitness is
[55:43.600 --> 55:50.200]  the new gateway drug to the far right. Yes, being competent, being successful, being happy.
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.480]  Out of the leaked Facebook document show four years ago, we want them depressed and alone
[55:55.480 --> 56:03.440]  and only talking to avatars. Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme. Oh, yes. Everything's
[56:03.440 --> 56:10.040]  bad that empowers you. It's all white. They're not saying science and math and reading and
[56:10.040 --> 56:16.000]  writing is white, so we don't want it. It's the sabotage of civilization. We're going
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.800]  to go to break and come back with all of this and more. I just want to remind listeners
[56:19.800 --> 56:24.840]  that we can't operate and stay on air without your support. And we've got to have a clearance

[58:12.600 --> 58:18.400]  Fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[58:18.400 --> 58:23.840]  into our bodies to change who we are, are only lowering us. They're only making us
[58:23.840 --> 58:28.680]  more depressed. In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled. It is only by going within
[58:28.680 --> 58:33.200]  and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why
[58:33.200 --> 58:38.120]  the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and
[58:38.120 --> 58:43.400]  minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically
[58:43.400 --> 58:46.800]  reach out beyond the third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come
[58:46.800 --> 58:50.600]  in at infowarsstore.com.
[58:50.600 --> 58:54.560]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going

[58:59.800 --> 59:06.680]  sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.

[1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:13.760]  Welcome to the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day 60 million
[1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:21.760]  people died between 1900 and 1946 and since then we've established a liberal world order
[1:00:21.760 --> 1:00:26.080]  and that hadn't happened in a long while. A lot of people died but nowhere near the
[1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:31.360]  chaos and now is the time when things are shifting. We're going to be a new world order
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:35.680]  out there and we've got to lead it. We've got to unite the rest of the free world and
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:57.320]  doing it. So anyway, what did you say? We're going to be a new world order out there.
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:00.560]  Love all the folks with the memes, keeping the love out there, keeping infowars live.
[1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:09.160]  We really appreciate everybody. We really appreciate we got this Croatian leader getting
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:14.200]  in Trudeau's face when he traveled to the European Union and also Christina Anderson
[1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:19.120]  who, wow, is this an amazing German member of the European Union parliament who just
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:26.440]  keeps kicking ass. This is a little dictator, a little dictator that could tramps around
[1:01:26.440 --> 1:01:56.160]  Europe and getting confronted. The Bankruptcy lies defending our rights
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:02:10.240]  of our children ourselves. We fought for centuries before because he's willing to risk his freedom
[1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:23.400]  in his life to fight it. But today people aren't willing to fight. I'm just paraphrasing.
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:32.120]  The Bankruptcy's symbol of the modern world has become a symbol of civil rights violations
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:41.520]  under your quasi-liberal boot in recent months. We watched how you trample women with horses
[1:02:41.520 --> 1:02:51.720]  and you block the bank accounts of single parents so that they can't even pay for their
[1:02:51.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  children's education and medicine. They can't pay utilities, mortgages for their homes.
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:08.920]  To you, these may be liberal methods from any citizen of the world that's called a dictator
[1:03:08.920 --> 1:03:23.080]  ship of the worst kind. Rest assured that the citizens of the world united can stop any
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:32.920]  regime that wants to destroy the freedom of the citizens. And then here's what she had
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:47.560]  to say. Mr. Trudeau, you are a disgrace for any democracy. Please spare us your presence.
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:51.720]  Christina Anderson, member radio listeners. I'm there ready for radio listeners. We're
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:56.040]  a TV program as well that I have to narrate for radio listeners. I will now give the floor
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:06.320]  to Ms. Christine Anderson for a point. Thank you. Based on article 195, it would have been
[1:04:06.320 --> 1:04:11.280]  more appropriate for Mr. Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, to address this house according
[1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:19.120]  to article 144, an article which was specifically designed to debate violations of human rights,
[1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:25.200]  democracy and the rule of law, which is clearly the case with Mr. Trudeau. Then again, a Prime
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:31.240]  Minister who openly admires the Chinese basic dictatorship, who tramples on fundamental
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:36.920]  rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists, just because they
[1:04:36.920 --> 1:04:42.920]  dared to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy should not be allowed to speak
[1:04:42.920 --> 1:04:50.520]  in this house at all. Mr. Trudeau, you are a disgrace for any democracy. Please spare
[1:04:50.520 --> 1:05:00.400]  us your presence. Thank you. Powerful. We'll be back if the number doesn't take your calls.
[1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:09.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:14.200]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:20.720]  have broken down, and infowarst is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:25.000]  operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:29.800]  their main move. Infowarst, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever. It is reaching
[1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:34.440]  more people than ever despite the censorship. But because of cost increasing and having
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:37.680]  to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we
[1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:45.120]  are running out of money. So listen, up to 75% off infowarstore.com on things like amazing
[1:05:45.120 --> 1:05:49.920]  patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation. On supplements, on
[1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:56.080]  books, on films, everything is 25 to 75% off right now. The biggest sell in our history
[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:10.400]  is at infowarstore.com. Thank you for your support. If you are receiving this transmission,
[1:06:10.400 --> 1:06:17.160]  you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:27.840]  Show. So, Puppet Biden is trampsing around Europe, looking lost and confused. But he
[1:06:27.840 --> 1:06:34.720]  takes time out from his busy day trying to start World War III to admit that, oh, this
[1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:38.760]  is causing global food shortages. Of course, he blames it all on Russia. Russia is just
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:44.200]  the cherry on top right now, but it is exacerbating it. And the mass of sanctions on Russia who
[1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:53.160]  supplies a large portion of the oil and gas to the world and fertilizer is crippling the
[1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:59.440]  situation and supercharging already exploding inflation. And now that big banks and oil
[1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:05.120]  companies have an excuse to blame all the inflation on Russia, they're allowing it to
[1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:14.760]  accelerate even worse. It really is an incredible time to be alive here. And I wanted to talk
[1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:19.920]  about this in a moment because the federal government is doing everything it can to block
[1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:25.760]  natural gas use in the United States. In fact, I can get clips of Biden saying, we're going
[1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:29.520]  to end up outlawing natural gas, even though it's totally clean, versus coal than it's
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:34.400]  natural gas. And trying to block natural gas drilling permits and new pipeline permits
[1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:40.760]  and blocking the keystone pipeline that brings both oil and gas through its systems. So he's
[1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:49.240]  publicly holding us underwater while we drowned and then talking about how much he wants to
[1:07:49.240 --> 1:08:00.360]  give us a life preserver. So today's live show headline really says it all, great reset,
[1:08:00.360 --> 1:08:05.480]  Biden heralds food shortages as next step of globalist power grab. And I played that
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:10.280]  clip last hour. He said, this will teach us to tighten our belts and to lower our carbon
[1:08:10.280 --> 1:08:19.400]  footprint and to cut our use of fossil fuels. Oh, but it's all the Russians fault. Boy,
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:23.160]  I sure wish it was their fault because they'd be easy to deal with. So we have the globalist
[1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:28.680]  ruling us right here at home. And here's the headline, EU signs US gas deal to curb
[1:08:28.680 --> 1:08:35.080]  reliance on Russia. The US will only supply 10% of what Russia does. So that won't help
[1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:39.400]  them with their electricity and we're cooking their food and with heating their homes, everything
[1:08:39.400 --> 1:08:47.000]  else they do. But now the US that's been running low on gas because of all the sanctions Biden
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:51.240]  has put on us with these regulations. I mean, that's what it is not giving out new permits
[1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:57.680]  and shutting down thousands of gas spurs or ordering gas companies to go dig up their
[1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:03.080]  gas pipelines and update them. We've got a ranch in East Texas got a gas pipeline that
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:07.360]  they updated in the 80s. Supposedly got a 60 year service hadn't had any leaks hadn't
[1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.440]  had any problems. It's not our gas. We don't get the money. It just gets a right away. And
[1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:15.720]  they're out there putting in a new deal. We were talking to the guy a few weeks ago when
[1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:19.800]  I was out there visiting family and he's like, yeah, it's just Biden's regulations. We got
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:26.040]  to pull up all this gas pipeline and put a new one in. Imagine that cost. Well, that's
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:32.080]  all passed on to you folks. Over 2000 gas spurs shut down the pipelines, the keystone pipeline
[1:09:32.080 --> 1:09:37.760]  shut down. And you wonder why you're paying more for electricity. Because they cut the
[1:09:37.760 --> 1:09:43.960]  coal power plants almost completely off. And now they're not getting enough gas to feed
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:49.160]  the power plants. And now they've cut off the Russian gas. And so now they're going to take
[1:09:49.160 --> 1:10:00.080]  our gas and give it to the Europeans. Yet, of course, jacked up prices. Artificial scarcity.
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:04.040]  And of course, we really shouldn't even complain. We're dumb enough to let these criminal steal
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:09.600]  elections and do this. And at least you're not in Africa. Because the UN and I actually
[1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:14.640]  agree with their numbers because I've done my own research on it is estimating 200 extra
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:19.600]  million people are going to starve to death the next two years because of inflation and
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:29.600]  because of this war. Because Africa gets about half its grain from Ukraine. You go, why don't
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:33.760]  the Africans just eat something else? That's one of the only high calorie things they can
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:41.400]  get cheap. And then they work in factories and farms growing stuff for us. But they can't
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:45.840]  grow grain in most areas of Africa. They can grow everything else. How dare those Africans
[1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:51.720]  want bread? But see, you won't hear a liberal say a word about that because they're not
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:57.840]  supposed to. They just wrap themselves in that they're liberal. And they love black people
[1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:02.480]  and the corporate spokespersons are all black, basically every corporate spokesperson. Of
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:08.640]  course, the companies aren't owned by black people. It's so evil, the new old order wearing
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:15.960]  blackface. Here is Biden talking about how very real the pain is going to be, how we're
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:20.200]  all under sanctions to hurt Russia, then I've got some inflation news.
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:25.640]  Nothing more to report. With regard to food shortages, yes, we did. We talked about food
[1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:32.640]  shortages. And it's going to be real. The price of these sanctions is not just imposed
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:38.640]  upon Russia. It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:41.760]  and our country as well.
[1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:46.520]  Where it really is is poor people. You see, folks in Africa and most people in Latin America
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:52.360]  and the Middle East and most areas of Asia pay about 40% of their paycheck for food.
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:57.160]  In the US and other industrialized countries, it's less than 20%. And they have graphs on
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:07.940]  this. They know that once food cost goes up to 50%, starvation, revolution and war start.
[1:12:07.940 --> 1:12:12.440]  And about six months ago, almost every third world country in the world is now spending
[1:12:12.440 --> 1:12:18.120]  more than half its money on food. And the graph is the worst it's ever been. It's going
[1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:23.160]  straight up. So it hasn't just gone above the 50% mark. In many areas, people are spending
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:29.840]  60% plus percent of their income that might just be a few dollars a day on food. And then
[1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:34.200]  those countries are going to collapse and masses are going to starve to death. And then
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.760]  those that survive, tough, strong military aged men that can make the trek while the
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:43.480]  women and children starve, they're going to come up here and be indoctrinated by the
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:50.480]  UN facilities, refugee camps for up to six months and then brought in to be the new globalist
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:55.240]  permanent underclass. And then we're in checkmate. It's called replacement migration. That's
[1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:59.760]  why if you talk about it, even though it's on the UN website and it's their plan, they
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:03.840]  will come after you so quick because that's a key linchpin, the globalist in documents
[1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:12.120]  that traditional watch got 15 years ago and Lou Dobbs covered that I put my film in game.
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:15.960]  They explained we're going to use a virus to take over and we're going to use the collapse
[1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:19.560]  of the third world to flood the first world and take over. And then we're going to bring
[1:13:19.560 --> 1:13:25.200]  in a casual society on the backs of that. And that's in my film in game made almost 15
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:35.560]  years ago, 2017, 2007. So think about that. So yeah, they're going to kill the Africans,
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:39.120]  kill the Latin Americans, kill the Muslims in the Middle East, all of them. And then
[1:13:39.120 --> 1:13:43.320]  those that survive are going to flood us and be brainwashed to be anti Christian, anti
[1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:47.760]  white by the rich billionaire white people that are actually eugenicists playing us all
[1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:55.720]  off against each other. EU signs US gas deal to curb reliance. And then you've got this
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:14:01.280]  majority of voters blame Joe Biden's policies for inflation, but he's just a puppet. How
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.720]  about the great reset? How about Klaus Schwab? How about the new world order? Who runs that
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.480]  identify them and they won't be able to get away with it. But no, it's just their puppet.
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:14.400]  That's about to preside over this disaster. Who can we get this Donald preside over this
[1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:23.080]  kid? Joe, he'll do it. Get Joe, he'll go along. Oh, but voters in the raspies and poll who
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:28.920]  make over $200,000 a year are much less worried about inflation and don't blame Joe Biden.
[1:14:28.920 --> 1:14:36.480]  All this when you're making $200,000 a year, you're spending less than 10% of your money
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:41.880]  on food. But I know when I was in college, paying my own way and trying to have a couple
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:47.280]  jobs and do it, I remember not buying the expensive food, buying the cheap food, buying
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:52.400]  the bargain food, because I wanted to live on my own when I was 18, 19. I had a couple
[1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:55.800]  jobs and I was doing better than most people. I had most of my money with my nice car and
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:58.720]  insurance and decent clothes, but I was in an apartment and you know, nice apartment
[1:14:58.720 --> 1:15:03.160]  with a, you know, had a nice pool and workout gym and stuff. And I took girls out on dates,
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.680]  but I was running out of money. You imagine an African or someone like America, they just
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:11.720]  starved to death, folks. The toll free number to join us to talk about all these subjects
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:15.640]  and any item you want to raise, any angle you want to go with, I want to hear from you
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:20.440]  all on this, this, this Supreme Court nominee that can't say what a woman is and all the
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:32.440]  rest of it. The toll free numbers, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, first time callers,
[1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:36.440]  long time callers, people from foreign countries, people that agree, people disagree. We're
[1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:43.200]  taking all your calls on this and a lot more coming up. The toll free number, 877-789-Alex.
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:50.120]  All right, we come back. Hospitals worldwide under UN control, mass murdering people on
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:59.280]  record and even bragging about it. We'll cover it all straight ahead.
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:03.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air
[1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:09.640]  and strong. I need your help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born for this.
[1:16:09.640 --> 1:16:14.080]  You were born for this. And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:19.120]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:23.840]  of dollars. And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're
[1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:30.040]  a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:37.080]  free of charge. And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22. Info wars and
[1:16:37.080 --> 1:16:41.760]  Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:47.400]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:51.880]  of thousands of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now,
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:57.120]  the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars
[1:16:57.120 --> 1:17:06.200]  as strong as ever. If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind
[1:17:06.200 --> 1:17:13.640]  control, the asleep prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually
[1:17:13.640 --> 1:17:20.560]  be the people are lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:28.080]  in a car or you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:32.400]  dizzy and confused. You have a concussion. And that's what the globalists have done.
[1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:37.720]  They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings. And
[1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:41.560]  then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech he called the great new narrative
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.720]  where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to
[1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:51.240]  make sure that people are all alone. So they can now guide humanity over the edge of a
[1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:56.440]  cliff. That's what the great reset is. They need darkness to thrive. Light lives at info

[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:06.400]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:12.560]  until the populations rebelled. They would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:18.760]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives. But because
[1:19:18.760 --> 1:19:25.120]  of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:31.800]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:37.240]  corporate takeover. And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever. The problem
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:41.760]  is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like Canada
[1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:48.040]  where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in Ontario and other areas
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:52.680]  of the world are following suit like Australia. So pray for these folks big time. It's a very
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:20:00.200]  serious situation and stay tuned into info wars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:26.200]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:36.200]  The grid. A digital frontier. I tried to think too close to some information as they moved
[1:20:36.200 --> 1:20:44.200]  through the computer. But it didn't look like it. Ships. Motorcycles. Where the circuits
[1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:52.200]  left freeways. I kept dreaming of the world I thought I'd never see. And this. One day.
[1:20:52.200 --> 1:21:06.080]  Why do they fear this broadcast. Above all others. Because I got in. And a lot of you
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:11.120]  got into areas in your life and saw the underbelly of what was happening. Learned how the world
[1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:16.560]  really works. And I have a consortium of experts and callers and individuals on whistleblowers
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:23.040]  that have seen behind the veil. And together like a jigsaw puzzle we put the pieces into
[1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:30.240]  place and reverse engineer the enemy's operation. I just got chills. The Holy Spirit knows what
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:36.320]  I said was so on target. So true. When we all realize we are collectively working together
[1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:44.080]  as individuals but through free will forming a collective we are unstoppable. We're getting
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:47.440]  the phones loaded up here with a lot of callers. We'll go to your next segment. Appreciate you
[1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:53.280]  all calling in. I want to hit this story. And I've talked a lot about this. There's been
[1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:59.080]  a lot of big new developments. But sometimes I watch the rebroadcaster. I listen to parts
[1:21:59.080 --> 1:22:07.520]  of it. And I just think you know you're such high energy Jones the whole time. And I'm
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:13.840]  being retrospective. Looking at myself and how I behave as if I'm an outsider. Sometimes
[1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:20.200]  you need to slow down a little bit. Because that gives it more gravity. And I really don't
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:30.120]  have the gravity to highlight what I'm about to say. I mean this is big stuff. And I have
[1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:33.480]  empathy. I know you have empathy. It's why you listen to this broadcast. And it's not
[1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:38.040]  because I'm a candy ass. It's not because I'm a bleeding heart. Empathy is when you
[1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:43.600]  see something happening to somebody else it's wrong. You don't like it because you instinctively
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:50.560]  know it's you or your family next. Now it manifests by a Christ likeness where you want
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:56.480]  to help people because you really love them. And the greatest thing is one that lays down
[1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:03.800]  his life for his brother. Or his fellow man, his fellow human. But if we don't do something
[1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:14.160]  about this. It's on us. And I am really convicted by this. In that I need to do something about
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:21.160]  it and you need to do something about it. And I don't even want to hate Interpol. Or
[1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:27.560]  the Justice Department or the Royal Mount of Police or any of these federal police agencies.
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:34.760]  I just wish that they weren't such cowardly evil lawyers at the top. Because this is
[1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:41.120]  all open and shut. And I'm going to hit the news here. But it's really more important
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:48.640]  just to set the table here. Remember about four years ago, blackface governor of Virginia.
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:53.760]  Then governor got replaced recently. Is a doctor who actually ran a hospital that would
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:59.800]  harvest organs of babies and sell them. He was on a show with two women. He said, listen,
[1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:11.440]  in that fake Southern voice he uses. He's like, we don't want the government involved
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:19.120]  in anything we do. We don't want any men involved. We don't want the police involved. The women
[1:24:19.120 --> 1:24:25.560]  are nodding their heads. It's going to be the woman and at least two doctors are going
[1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:32.800]  to decide whether we keep baby comfortable. And everything is a double-speak demon talk.
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:39.880]  The sick, sweet, oily, liberal voice. That I'm not a predator. Well, this guy literally
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:50.000]  carves baby's organs, kills them. But of course his camouflage, his coloration is, I'm a liberal.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:55.200]  I'm loving for you. And he says, we don't want men involved with what a woman do, do we?
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:06.240]  The women like, mm-mm. On the radio show. We'll shoot a video. He go, sometime we decide
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:12.280]  that you'll keep them comfortable. Sometime we let them go on and they don't get kept
[1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:18.600]  comfortable. Now he said, I had a black uniform all sharp. We keep them alive and harvest
[1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:23.480]  their organs once all the orders come in to get top bidder pricing. Everyone would just
[1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:28.000]  be tearing that hospital up. He'd be lynched out front in an hour. I'm not saying do that.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:39.760]  I'm just saying that was what happened. He was in a Nazi uniform. Because he does that,
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:47.960]  he goes, we don't want government involved or police. And the women like, no. And we
[1:25:47.960 --> 1:25:57.960]  don't want courts involved. No. It's between woman and doctor. And we decide whether baby
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:05.120]  live or baby die. We decide to resuscitate or not to resuscitate. Now that's not regular
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:10.240]  resuscitation where you fell off five story building while you're painting or you're replacing
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:14.880]  a light bulb and they show up and you're dead and they give you mouth to mouth and defibrillate
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:20.200]  and start your heart again. No, no, no. In bioethics terms, because all these terms
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:25.560]  be different things, heat may be comfortable, means prep them, drug them up, put them in
[1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:30.880]  a coma, waiting to get their organs taken. That's keep baby comfortable. That's get them
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:37.640]  ready for harvesting. And resuscitation means they go, okay, we don't know we want to keep
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:41.200]  this baby alive. The woman's all drugged up. We're going to get her to agree to say, oh,
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:47.520]  baby didn't look too good. You won't say bye bye to baby. Oh, you agree. Oh, I got a doctor.
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:52.040]  He said you got to have one more doctor. We agree. She said we're going to get the baby.
[1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:56.320]  And then they kill it. But if they decide not to kill it, because they're already deciding
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:27:01.320]  it's dead, this isn't a human under bioethics, we've decided this baby isn't a human. So
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:07.640]  they go, oh, the baby not alive. We just you want to keep it alive. We're going to resuscitate.
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:11.760]  We're going to keep it alive. It's alive. It's hearts beating. No. Then if they decide
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:19.160]  to not resuscitate, that means they then kill it. See the pervert way of doing it. I'm not
[1:27:19.160 --> 1:27:23.080]  saying he's a pedophile. He just kills babies and supports killing babies after they're born.
[1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:27.360]  Harvest workers. But I mean, I was going to cast somebody for, you know, like a team of
[1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:31.920]  pedophiles. It'd be him and Brian Stelter, you know, for a movie, not center pedophiles.
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:36.440]  They're just he's just a ghoul that kills kids. But see, that's the whole basis of this. You
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.280]  see, I'm going to hit these articles. We're going to go to break them and hit these. I'm
[1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:44.480]  going to write your calls. But you got to get the flavor of the language they're using
[1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:49.680]  and how they operate, ladies and gentlemen. And then you'll know why, whether it's New
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:56.760]  Zealand or Australia or Germany or France, whether it's Austria or Ireland, whether it's
[1:27:56.760 --> 1:28:04.000]  Canada or the United States in all blue city, globalist controlled areas. The directive
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.280]  came down from the bioethics board of the insurance companies that run the hospitals
[1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:17.680]  now and said, we want you to give old people this group of drugs that is lethal injection.
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:23.760]  But first you hook them up to an endubation, run it for five days or however long you max
[1:28:23.760 --> 1:28:29.360]  out their insurance on top of the money you get for killing them. And then you give them
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:35.080]  the lethal injection drug, which is on record. I got a whole stack of it right here. New
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:40.240]  articles about it today. And the articles are like, is it wrong? We killed them. Is it
[1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:46.840]  wrong? We gave them lethal injection. And nobody's stopping them, not your local grand
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:50.880]  juries, not your federal, because they're all a bunch of candy ass lawyers that watch
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:59.320]  CNBC and MSNBC and CNN. They're all a party to this mass murder, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:28:59.320 --> 1:29:04.240]  I need your help. I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong. I need your
[1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:09.520]  help making sure that our mission continues on. I was born for this. You were born for
[1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:14.840]  this and people are really waking up right now. But we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:19.200]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars. And
[1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:24.000]  now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:30.680]  thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:37.240]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Bandot video have
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.760]  become a mothership promoting the pro human liberty movement worldwide. But the expenses
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:47.240]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[1:29:47.240 --> 1:29:51.240]  of dollars a month. So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now. The
[1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:56.440]  mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting credible products and keep info wars
[1:29:56.440 --> 1:30:03.840]  as strong as ever. Our world is so full of hype. We are force fed dehumanizing propaganda
[1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:08.680]  by the corporate media, by the controlled churches and universities. Why is this the
[1:30:08.680 --> 1:30:14.440]  case? Because we innately by God have been given the keys for our own minds, our own
[1:30:14.440 --> 1:30:20.680]  psyches, our own souls. And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:26.400]  the quote fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things
[1:30:26.400 --> 1:30:32.000]  we've got to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us. They're only
[1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:36.520]  making us more depressed. In the end, they're only making us less filled. It is only by
[1:30:36.520 --> 1:30:41.720]  going within and really making the connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves.
[1:30:41.720 --> 1:30:46.200]  That's why the globalist bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:51.080]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements. Our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:55.480]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension. And that's where the incredible products come
[1:30:55.480 --> 1:31:02.000]  in at m4store.com. Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:08.600]  really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain. And when it
[1:31:08.600 --> 1:31:15.080]  comes to information, boy is that true today. We see the entire global corrupt into a human
[1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:21.480]  depopulation, great recent combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes,
[1:31:21.480 --> 1:31:28.560]  their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:34.320]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:40.600]  hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:31:40.600 --> 1:31:45.760]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[1:31:45.760 --> 1:31:51.760]  silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with
[1:31:51.760 --> 1:31:55.760]  diligence. And that's why it's hard to share in full Wars links and band up video links.
[1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:00.920]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:07.040]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes
[1:32:07.040 --> 1:32:12.040]  the world. The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry. And
[1:32:12.040 --> 1:32:17.040]  now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:21.760]  Including a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Waging
[1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:31.360]  war on corruption. It's Alex Jones. And we are back. Okay, so let me give you the boil
[1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:37.600]  down. Then I'll hit these stories and go to the calls. The Western world after World
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:44.720]  War II had a baby boom and our populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada,
[1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:52.720]  the U.S. doubled on average in the next 30 years. And now we have the biggest aged population
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:34:00.160]  in the world, same numbers for Japan and China as well. China's more than doubled its population
[1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:07.760]  to one point almost 5 billion. India is the same. And so there's been a decision by Blackrock
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:13.120]  on record and Bill Gates has given speeches at TED Talks about this to just kill people
[1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:21.880]  at age 75. The main author of Obamacare Ezekiel Emanuel, Ron Emanuel's brother, has written
[1:34:21.880 --> 1:34:29.360]  essays and articles about how he hopes to die at 75. By the way, he's passed 75 and
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:37.880]  hasn't died. He means he wants you to die at 75. Or younger because they can't pay you
[1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:41.520]  your pension funds. They've stolen the money and they don't want to go to jail like Bernie
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:48.320]  Madoff. They want you to die. There's the article in the Atlantic by Steve Jobs' wife
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:53.360]  that promotes pedophilia. So here's an article and there's a bunch of these and I actually
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:34:59.880]  have a study. Sweden bombshell report demolishes COVID-19 pandemic response. Many elderly people
[1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:04.080]  were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies effectively in
[1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:10.480]  their lives. And it goes on to say that bioethics boards and following directives of the U.N.
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:18.800]  and what Fauci said, this is global medical system, killed them. Oh, you don't get oxygen,
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:22.960]  you get morphine that makes you stop fighting and makes you stop struggling when you're
[1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:26.520]  not getting air so you die because you're supposed to wake up when you're not getting
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:32.680]  enough air and walk around. That's one of the things you do. But no, no, no, just take
[1:35:32.680 --> 1:35:38.280]  this, go to sleep, die. But hey, they went further in the United States and Canada and
[1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:43.840]  the U.K. Here's the study, evaluation of science advanced during the COVID-19 pandemic in
[1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:51.680]  Sweden. It gets worse, just got to go read it. Look at this New York Times article back
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:57.960]  in 2017 about a execution drug that's also a common sedative, but it says on the insert,
[1:35:57.960 --> 1:36:05.040]  do not take this if you're having breathing problems, it will kill you. And it goes into
[1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:12.600]  when the chemist named Armin Walzer invented the sedative more powerful than Valium more
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:17.160]  than 40 years ago, he thought his team had found something really special and it goes
[1:36:17.160 --> 1:36:27.720]  on to say, but it kills people. And it's Madazzalam and England bought more than 100 times what
[1:36:27.720 --> 1:36:32.360]  they'd ever bought before, six months before COVID and stockpile it. And then the government,
[1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:39.280]  their national health service ordered to give it to people who couldn't breathe. Here it
[1:36:39.280 --> 1:36:46.560]  is, doctors asked for death penalty drugs to treat coronavirus. These are 25 states
[1:36:46.560 --> 1:36:51.120]  that still have the death penalty. So the left's like, Oh, don't kill a child molester
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:37:01.040]  or a child murder. But oh my God, let's give the old people their shot. Death penalty states
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:08.160]  urge to release stockpiles of drugs for COVID-19 patients. Yes, yes, give them the lethal injection.
[1:37:08.160 --> 1:37:12.000]  Drug scandal, care homes accused of using powerful sedatives to make coronavirus victims die
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:16.360]  more quickly as you skyrocketed. And that was the triage argument. Oh, the hospitals
[1:37:16.360 --> 1:37:21.200]  are to be so full, we'll just kill the old people to make room. But all that was a lie.
[1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:26.160]  Stay in your house 15 days, wear a mask, only 15 days. So the hospitals don't get overwhelmed.
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:31.760]  It was all two years later, the worst part about 15 days of flattened the curves the
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:40.200]  first two years, ladies and gentlemen. Mendoza alum injection is being used to kill people
[1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:45.880]  in the UK, big articles on that. So did care homes use powerful sedatives to speed COVID
[1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:50.320]  deaths? Number of prescriptions for the drug doubled during the height of the pandemic.
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:56.080]  Yeah, and they stockpiled it so you could do that. So that's all the articles on it.
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:01.520]  There's a bunch of others, but they're not accused. They did it and killed other people.
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.600]  And here it is. Supplies of sedative use for COVID-19 patients diverted from France to
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:12.200]  avoid potential shortages. Yes, we've got to give it to people who can't breathe, even
[1:38:12.200 --> 1:38:18.400]  though it says don't give it to someone that can't breathe. Yes, yes, keep them comfortable.
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:25.360]  Oh, FDA reports shortage of sedative drug used for putting COVID-19 patients on ventilators
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:35.640]  so they don't struggle. And it goes on and on. Oh, and even a small overdose of the drug
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:40.600]  that's used to calm people kills you. There's a Daily Mail article from years ago. Isn't
[1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:44.320]  that sweet? And they gave them three times that you're supposed to give them and killed
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:53.120]  them, but it's liberal. Witnesses describe the effects of execution drug. Mendoza alum,
[1:38:53.120 --> 1:39:00.560]  but oh, no, it's for COVID patients. Oh, there was such a shortage, too. All right, I'm going
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:05.000]  to go to your phone calls. I really appreciate everybody calling in. We'll go into all the
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.520]  different subjects you want here. And then we got Roger Stone pop it in for a couple
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:12.240]  seconds. We'll continue on with your calls and so much more. And then I am doing a special
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:16.320]  Saturday show. I didn't do the other live show I said, because I was sick and didn't
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:19.840]  know why I was dizzy and turned out to be a sinus infection. It thought it was my heart
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:23.920]  or something. It was ridiculous. It was my sinus. Now the middle ear infection is not
[1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:28.600]  there and I'm not like wheeling around and, you know, having problems. I was like, hold
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.360]  on to the microphone is kind of focus or I was stumbling around the office. So we're
[1:39:33.360 --> 1:39:38.920]  going to be taking your calls, but I will tomorrow, 1pm to 4pm, set up guests, everything.
[1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:43.720]  I will be live, commercial free, taking your phone calls tomorrow. And then of course the
[1:39:43.720 --> 1:39:50.960]  Sunday show from 4pm to 8pm of myself, Owen Schreuer and Chrissy Lee. They exposed this
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:56.640]  elementary school with the open PEDO training going on and so much more and the police got
[1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:01.000]  called on her because, you know, the main crime is stopping any leftist operation. That's
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.880]  all coming up on the Sunday show as well. And I've got some of that next hour I'm going
[1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:08.680]  to show you. But right now, who do we got? We got Johnny. We got Mary. We got Johnny.
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:14.960]  Two Johnny's in a row. We got Greg, Jack, Bart, Carlos, Ed, Alex and many others. And
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:18.960]  let's go ahead and talk to a Florida caller. Let's talk to Alex in Florida. Alex, thanks
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:19.960]  for calling.
[1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:26.600]  Hey, Mr. Jones, thank you for taking my call. Thank you. I just wanted to focus on, you
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:29.880]  know, the lack of virtue and the lack of morale that we've seen this country because when
[1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:34.240]  you look at everything going on, whether it's Ukraine and Biden, the lack of temperance
[1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:38.040]  and prudence there or the lack of justice when it comes to how we're treating our citizens
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:42.120]  and when you study history, which I know you're a fan of, you know, the decline of virtue
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:44.240]  has preceded the destruction of every nation.
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:49.520]  Absolutely. We are selfish, lying babies. And so we're going to collapse and die.
[1:40:49.520 --> 1:40:53.280]  Well, and I'm hoping that when it comes down to the people, people are going to be the
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:56.920]  ones that stand up, you know, in my local community, I'm working with local farmers
[1:40:56.920 --> 1:41:00.720]  trying to get local produce growing. And I try to stick to my niche, which is health
[1:41:00.720 --> 1:41:05.760]  and nutrition. And I try to spread the news and spread the love that way and tell everybody
[1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:10.320]  what they need to know in my niche. And then I just hope that when it all comes down to
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:14.840]  it, people stick up to their virtues and they do the right thing, because that's what it's
[1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:18.880]  really going to come down to. You know, no, no institution is better than the people that
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:23.280]  comprise it. And our government do not reflect us. So it really does come down to us. So
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:26.880]  whatever gimmicks or games they want to pull, it's just going to come down to the virtue
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:31.000]  that we all have in our hearts. And like you said the other day, that true connection with
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.640]  God is what's really going to save this country.
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:40.200]  100%. And I mean, look, it goes from Oh, just let homosexuals get married to let us have
[1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:43.880]  access to your five year old to tell them they're really another sex. So we control
[1:41:43.880 --> 1:41:48.400]  their whole development, robbing their whole future. This is about total control of our
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:49.400]  children.
[1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:54.080]  Yeah, it's disgusting. And on a side note, you know, everybody needs to go to infowarstore.com
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:58.280]  definitely by DNA force, especially with everything going on. It's a great supplement. I took
[1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:03.040]  mine this morning. And also too, with mitigating the harmful effects of EMF, Mr. Jones, I
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:08.960]  highly recommend looking to Aries Tech. Aries like the Zodiac and Tech. I have it all over

[1:42:12.960 --> 1:42:14.360]  like and appreciate it.
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:18.000]  I will, brother. Thank you so much for the call. We're going to go to break. We're going
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:21.720]  to go right back to your calls on the other side. And since he mentions that we have the

[1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:03.320]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:09.160]  major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[1:43:09.160 --> 1:43:14.720]  of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:20.160]  and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:24.400]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is
[1:43:24.400 --> 1:43:29.200]  a bad thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my
[1:43:29.200 --> 1:43:32.680]  four national daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well.
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:37.120]  I love to make breakfast. And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for
[1:43:37.120 --> 1:43:42.680]  your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:48.720]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions
[1:43:48.720 --> 1:43:54.640]  are coming together. They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth and domesticate
[1:43:54.640 --> 1:43:57.880]  us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:07.600]  Cover commander here with an important message to humanity. I have decided that all of you
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:15.720]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe. But the injection is not ready.
[1:44:15.720 --> 1:44:24.720]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:33.720]  I also need you to wear masks and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations. That
[1:44:33.720 --> 1:44:40.720]  way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy leaving companies that
[1:44:40.720 --> 1:44:49.720]  only I own profitable. You will then be my slaves. And then you get that special shot
[1:44:49.720 --> 1:44:55.120]  of freedom from Cobra. It will remove your immune system. So you'll be depended on me
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:45:02.720]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:06.720]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:12.720]  First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the senior citizens
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:17.720]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:22.720]  or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your X2 for the last couple of
[1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:30.720]  years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually. People think I'm 55 years old. And I was already
[1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:34.720]  taking your other supplements but I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to
[1:45:34.720 --> 1:45:38.720]  do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it, it
[1:45:38.720 --> 1:45:43.720]  doesn't happen immediately. But you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:48.720]  okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:54.720]  have to put on derma blend anymore, you know. So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really
[1:45:54.720 --> 1:45:59.720]  has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:45:59.720 --> 1:46:05.720]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, VasoBeat will be your new
[1:46:05.720 --> 1:46:13.720]  favorite infowars life formula. Using only water and beetroot, VasoBeat is the most concentrated

[1:46:33.720 --> 1:46:38.720]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot. Figure naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin
[1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:46.720]  C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K and more.
[1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:58.720]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in VasoBeat from infowars life today.
[1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:08.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:08.720 --> 1:47:25.720]  All right, let's go to Kellan and we'll go to Bart, Carlos and many others. Kellan in
[1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:29.720]  the great state of Texas. You're on the air. Thanks for calling.
[1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:34.720]  Yeah, Alex. Thanks for taking my call, man. First of all, I wanted to plug your down and
[1:47:34.720 --> 1:47:40.720]  out here infowarfstore.com. I took a bunch of prescription sleep and medicine and struggled
[1:47:40.720 --> 1:47:45.720]  with sleep problems for three, four years. I started taking down and out about two months
[1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:51.720]  ago and it totally changed my sleep cycle. It hits pretty quick and you do sleep throughout
[1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:54.720]  the night, so I wanted to thank you for pouring me onto that.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.720]  Well, that's my biggest problem is that all these supplements are cutting edge top of
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:03.720]  the line and I forget to take them all myself. When I remember to take knockout that isn't
[1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:07.720]  wrong. I mean, that's good, folks. Sometimes you don't want the strongest thing compared
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:12.720]  to down and out or rocket rest. There are three different formulas, three different systems.
[1:48:12.720 --> 1:48:16.720]  They're all very different, but down and out is the strongest and it does it naturally.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:20.720]  So it's not like a sleeping pill that makes you sleep, but you're not getting REM sleep.
[1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:24.720]  It actually puts you in your natural sleep. You just reminded me that I exhausted a bottle
[1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:29.720]  of it like six months ago and never took it home to put it by my bed. I am the worst about
[1:48:29.720 --> 1:48:35.720]  taking my own supplements. Yeah, Alex, I'd recommend you get right back on it, man. I
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:39.720]  think it definitely helped me. And like you said, there's no, you don't feel like you're
[1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:44.720]  hungover the next day. You don't feel lethargic. Kind of just get up and get up and attack the
[1:48:44.720 --> 1:48:47.720]  day, man. So I just really wanted to thank you for alerting me to that.
[1:48:47.720 --> 1:48:50.720]  Brother, I want to thank you for keeping us on air because all I want to do is beat these
[1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:55.720]  globalists. So you're our sponsor. Thank you so much, Kellan. What is your point on the
[1:48:55.720 --> 1:49:01.720]  whole great reset? Yeah, Alex, again, I just, I was a little skeptical about it at first,
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:05.720]  you know, two years ago when they first started with the lockdowns and the, you know, the
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:09.720]  15 days of slow the spread. And as I, my brother actually turned me on the and actually started
[1:49:09.720 --> 1:49:12.720]  watching you. And I was like, this guy makes a lot of sense. I started doing a little bit
[1:49:12.720 --> 1:49:17.720]  more digging, you know, on some of the topics you were talking about. And it's just crazy
[1:49:17.720 --> 1:49:21.720]  to me how blatant, blatant in your face it is. It's almost like they think we're that stupid
[1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:25.720]  that we, that people don't notice it. And then I look at people in the street and I'm like,
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:30.720]  you guys are in a trance. So it's kind of hard, you know, I do my best to stay, stay red
[1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:35.720]  killed and try to inform people in a polite way. You know, I don't want to, don't want to,
[1:49:35.720 --> 1:49:38.720]  don't want to call them an idiot or call them stupid. I kind of just want to be like, Hey,
[1:49:38.720 --> 1:49:41.720]  how do you not see this information that's right in front of your face? It's almost like
[1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:46.720]  there's a veil and I feel like the veil has been kind of 50% lifted. And yeah, no, we got
[1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:51.720]  50% of the country that thinks, you know, that believes in what we're talking about with
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:54.720]  the gray reset in the globe was and you got people that the other half look at us like
[1:49:54.720 --> 1:49:58.720]  we're crazy. So I don't know. I've been praying a lot. I don't know where this thing's going,
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:01.720]  man. So I just wanted to thank you for keeping everybody informed and it definitely made a
[1:50:01.720 --> 1:50:03.720]  believer out of me. So thank you.
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:10.720]  Brother, God bless you. And look, what's happened is, Helen, is they've put people in a near
[1:50:10.720 --> 1:50:16.720]  trans state medically. That's on record. And then they can program animalistic, mindless,
[1:50:16.720 --> 1:50:23.720]  angry areas of their brains and basically then turn them into robots that they control.
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:28.720]  And so what we're seeing is the weaker minded people for whatever reason, they're
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:33.720]  upbringing, whatever, that have succumbed to the control. And as things get worse, they
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:39.720]  don't turn against the system and think that it screwed them over. They think us not
[1:50:39.720 --> 1:50:44.720]  submitting is the reason things aren't working. Does that make sense? So they think the
[1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:49.720]  inflation is really Trump's fault. They think it's really Putin's fault. They don't know
[1:50:49.720 --> 1:50:54.720]  that Klaus Schwab and the UN won inflation to bankrupt them to make them totally desperate
[1:50:54.720 --> 1:50:59.720]  so they can control them. Look, take black folks. They had less illegitimacy 60, 70 years
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:05.720]  ago after World War II than whites. White illegitimacy was about 8 percent. Black
[1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:10.720]  illegitimacy was about 5 percent. Now black illegitimacy is at 80 percent. White illegitimacy
[1:51:10.720 --> 1:51:15.720]  is about 50. But they came in with money and government loans and said don't have your
[1:51:15.720 --> 1:51:20.720]  man in the house, broke down the family, hyped up gangster culture and destroyed the black
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:25.720]  community. This is a scientific plan. Thank you for the call, Helen. God bless you. That
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:31.720]  was another great call. Let's go ahead and go to Bart in Georgia. Bart, you're on the
[1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:38.720]  floor. Welcome. Hey, I just want to say if we don't take radical action now, historians
[1:51:38.720 --> 1:51:46.720]  will in the future will refer to 2022 as the beginning of the second great American depression.
[1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:51.720]  I'm asking you to help us boycott gas and diesel say one or two days a week on their
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:56.720]  busiest days and try to shut them down. I don't know what you think. Well, I'm not an
[1:51:56.720 --> 1:52:02.720]  economist, but here's the deal. Once they create scarcity, you can boycott somebody when there's
[1:52:02.720 --> 1:52:07.720]  not scarcity and it gets their attention. When there's not enough gas or diesel to sell,
[1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:11.720]  particularly diesel, that's the big shortage of that as you're alluded to in Europe and
[1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:19.720]  the U.S., then they just don't care. And so what we need is to somehow inform people about
[1:52:19.720 --> 1:52:23.720]  this scam and our energy is being cut off. But if the American people don't see Biden
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:27.720]  shutting down all these pipelines like Keystone and others and then wonder why the prices
[1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:31.720]  are going up, then that's their fault. But it's not their fault. Biden has like a 25
[1:52:31.720 --> 1:52:35.720]  percent approval rating even in Cook polls. Even Democrats are turning against him getting
[1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:41.720]  it's a scam. The problem is they steal elections and they're betting their whole midterm in
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:48.720]  228 days on terror attacks by patriot movements. Two weeks ago Homeland Security
[1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.720]  visually said they believe there'll be a patriot terror attack dealing with election
[1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:57.720]  integrity, claiming Trump won. That way when we question the election that they're going
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:02.720]  to steal in 228 days, they stole the last one. Why wouldn't they steal this one? Then
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:07.720]  you're a terrorist, you see, if you question that. So you see where they're going, brother?
[1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:14.720]  Yes, sir. And I also heard about a possible strike in the California oil refinery. I don't
[1:53:14.720 --> 1:53:16.720]  know if it's going to happen, but they're talking about it. So there's another...
[1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:19.720]  Sir, there are strikes all over because they're trying to make them be inoculated. That's why
[1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:25.720]  the New York globalist mayor had to back off because all these movie stars and sports
[1:53:25.720 --> 1:53:29.720]  people wouldn't come to New York because they're not going to take the shots. They tell you
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:33.720]  to take the shots, but they're not taking them, that he had to back off and say, we're not
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:37.720]  going to make rich people take the shots, only poor people. I'm not joking. Talk about
[1:53:37.720 --> 1:53:42.720]  discrimination. Talk about medical apartheid.
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:46.720]  Yes, sir. I just also want to point out, I don't know if anybody's ever said this, but
[1:53:46.720 --> 1:53:51.720]  just the fact that I got through and I'm not trying to pat myself on the back, I just passed
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:57.720]  the IQ test because liberals are too stupid to get through to you on the phone.
[1:53:57.720 --> 1:54:01.720]  Brother, I hear you. I absolutely hear what you're saying. Where do you think this is
[1:54:01.720 --> 1:54:03.720]  all going, Bart?
[1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:09.720]  Well, I get feelings about these bad things that are going to happen, and I just feel that
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:13.720]  even though I know it's going to happen, there's nothing we can do to stop it. It's just too
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:18.720]  powerful. So all you can do is pray to Jesus and you get rid of me, God.
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:22.720]  I totally agree, because you know why? We turned on God. We killed billions of babies,
[1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:27.720]  60 plus million in the U.S. We did all this, and that's why the devil knows to get us to
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:32.720]  do evil and God removes himself, and then we're screwed. And so, yeah, we're going to get hurt.
[1:54:32.720 --> 1:54:36.720]  The question is, how bad? I totally agree with you. People ask me all the time, like,
[1:54:36.720 --> 1:54:40.720]  how are you dealing with all the demonization lies and Justice Department trying to indict
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:44.720]  you, and I'm like, we're all on a sinking ship together. How do you think I'm dealing
[1:54:44.720 --> 1:54:50.720]  with it? You're sitting right next to me, brother. I mean, we are all in the same situation.
[1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:54.720]  Bart, thank you for that point. Since I mentioned it, let me actually show you the clip. I'm not
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:57.720]  like mainstream media that just says something and then never shows it. You know, Jones is
[1:54:57.720 --> 1:55:05.720]  a Nazi, never show it, because it's not true. This is the mayor of New York, Eric Adams,
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:11.720]  who ran on getting rid of the mandate, then wouldn't get rid of the mandate, but now nobody
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  wants to come to New York, including just, you know, outsiders. So now he's saying, well,
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:20.720]  if you don't live in the city, you don't have to have the shots. Wow. So you're like an
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:24.720]  underclass of slaves that serve the system, but all the rich people don't have to take
[1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:28.720]  the deadly injections. And then if you look at him, it's all black people on the stage
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:35.720]  with him, like, look, it's all black people. So you need to do what I say and let the
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:40.720]  globalist raise your taxes and be above the law. And only black people basically get kicked
[1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:45.720]  out of places and they don't take the shots. It's medical apartheid. But it's okay because
[1:55:45.720 --> 1:55:51.720]  he's black. See, they use blackface to carry out their execution operation. Here he is.
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:58.720]  That is not only the game of baseball, but that's the game of life. And we have to be
[1:55:58.720 --> 1:56:05.720]  on the field in order to win in both the game of life. Today I signed emergency executive
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:12.720]  order 62, expanding the performance exemption to private employer mandates. This is about
[1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:19.720]  putting New York City based performance on a level playing field. Day one, when I was
[1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:29.720]  mayor, I looked at the rule that stated hometown players had an unfair disadvantage for those
[1:56:29.720 --> 1:56:36.720]  who were coming to visit. And immediately I felt we needed to look at that. But my medical
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.720]  professionals say, Eric, we're at a different place. We have to wait until we're at a place
[1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:48.720]  where we're at a low area and we can reexamine some of the mandates. We're here today.
[1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:56.720]  Currently, only non-residents are exempt under this executive order. We expanded it to residents
[1:56:56.720 --> 1:57:04.720]  of New York City. Wow. Unimaginable. We were treating our performers. Shut it down. Let's
[1:57:04.720 --> 1:57:12.720]  just stop. So if you live in New York, you got to take the shot. And then he spins that
[1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:17.720]  and goes, but if you're a performer that lives there, you don't have to. It goes on. I mean,
[1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:20.720]  this is next level, folks. I mean, if you're a good little globalist, you don't have to
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:27.720]  take the shot. You're not. You got to take it. I mean, next level. And by the way, that's
[1:57:27.720 --> 1:57:31.720]  some big news on the shots I haven't gotten to. But I'm going to finish up with calls
[1:57:31.720 --> 1:57:35.720]  and go to Roger Stone, then I'm going to hit this. Remember that Rafael Nadal that put
[1:57:35.720 --> 1:57:43.720]  down Kjokovic? He can't even play anymore. There's more to the story. He took his shot
[1:57:43.720 --> 1:57:50.720]  and there's consequences. You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it.
[1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:56.720]  It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:05.720]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti human program. And
[1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:11.720]  man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[1:58:11.720 --> 1:58:16.720]  done. So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them
[1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:22.720]  at infowars.com and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:27.720]  support more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that
[1:58:27.720 --> 1:58:34.720]  at infowars.com. We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold
[1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:39.720]  out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix. It's so amazing and our new
[1:58:39.720 --> 1:58:46.720]  immune support formula that's so critical. They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarsstore.com
[1:58:46.720 --> 1:58:51.720]  right now. The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:57.720]  They financed major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:02.720]  their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers. That the family as we know
[1:59:02.720 --> 1:59:07.720]  it is a bad thing and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of
[1:59:07.720 --> 1:59:12.720]  the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters
[1:59:12.720 --> 1:59:17.720]  and husbands is a bad thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my
[1:59:17.720 --> 1:59:21.720]  daughter, my four national daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to
[1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:25.720]  make it as well. I love to make breakfast. And literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:30.720]  to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have the
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:36.720]  communal event. And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding. It's our normal
[1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:42.720]  biological actions are coming together. They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of
[1:59:42.720 --> 1:59:48.720]  filth and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue.
[1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:55.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:55.720 --> 2:00:10.720]  All right. Roger Stone is coming up in 15 minutes. A couple of segments. I'm attending your calls
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:16.720]  a little bit the next hour. And Jay Dyer takes over. I got so much hit. I forgot to get it.
[2:00:16.720 --> 2:00:20.720]  We've already covered a lot though. We're doing a decent job here today. We got Bonecrusher.
[2:00:20.720 --> 2:00:25.720]  We got Jake. We got Greg. I'm going to these calls. The order they're received. Carlos is
[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:31.720]  in Canada. He says Putin's setting up Russia for a traditional America. His actions are
[2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:35.720]  that. I study what the Russians are doing. They're paying people to have children. They're
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:39.720]  promoting Christianity. They're not letting the pedophile training go on the schools.
[2:00:39.720 --> 2:00:43.720]  That's definitely true. There's no doubt about it. But I have something to say about
[2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:50.720]  Biden's sanctions and who they're really being here in a moment. Carlos, go ahead and make your point.
[2:00:50.720 --> 2:00:55.720]  Well, I just wanted to mention, Alex, that in an annual message delivered to Congress by
[2:00:55.720 --> 2:01:03.720]  President James Monroe in the year the 1823 in the month of December, he warned the American
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:11.720]  nations. Sorry, he warned in America to the European nations that the United States would
[2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:19.720]  not tolerate further colonization of America or the continent or puppet monarchs. This became
[2:01:19.720 --> 2:01:24.720]  known and is most. The Monroe Doctrine. Yeah, we went to Mexico and threw out puppet monarchs
[2:01:24.720 --> 2:01:31.720]  of the Austrian and European Empire repeatedly. Exactly. So the US Monroe Doctrine, the day has
[2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:37.720]  come for Russia to establish its equivalent of what will become in history, the Putin Doctrine,
[2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:43.720]  which essentially is the same. It will not tolerate any further encumbrances near its
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:49.720]  borders with nuclear facilities. You heard the Marine Corps song from the halls of Montezuma
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:57.720]  to the shores of Tripoli. We repeatedly went down to Mexico and just took out the European
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:02.720]  dictators that were coming in and taking over Mexico. But usually, actually what in both cases
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:11.720]  the Mexicans killed him before we could. Well, I spoke to my son yesterday because he brought
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:17.720]  us some very good questions and I said to him, would you know where the NATO and the United
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:23.720]  States is taking this? Because I think it was pretty clear what Putin has been asking from
[2:02:23.720 --> 2:02:31.720]  the very beginning. He's just been saying, look, no militarized Ukraine, no denazified.
[2:02:31.720 --> 2:02:35.720]  Yeah, no more expansion and I get all that and also the Ukrainian deal with the nuclear
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:40.720]  weapons. Yeah, the West started the fight towards Saros Braggs. Here's the problem. I know that
[2:02:40.720 --> 2:02:46.720]  Biden's an idiot, Carlos, but the people running him aren't. Doing all these sanctions on Russia
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:51.720]  that's already basically self-sufficient now means he'll sell his fertilizer and his gas
[2:02:51.720 --> 2:02:58.720]  and oil to India and China, which are already outspacing and outpacing the West. The globalists
[2:02:58.720 --> 2:03:03.720]  are not a Chinese century. And so if you look at the long-term effects, this will hurt
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:11.720]  America and hegemony. Yes, and in the proxy war, the United States cannot afford to lose it
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:17.720]  with NATO or Russia cannot afford to lose. I understand. So I'm asking you why then did they do this?
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:25.720]  Well, I think in all fairness, I think it was the Belt Road project with China was threatening
[2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:31.720]  that it was only going to make that go quicker now. Right. And exactly. And second, it was also
[2:03:31.720 --> 2:03:39.720]  the German welcoming of trade with Russia very dynamically and also having energy coming in
[2:03:39.720 --> 2:03:45.720]  from Russia ever more. A real new world order, if you want to call it. Yeah, he said that.
[2:03:45.720 --> 2:03:50.720]  He said the Brexit is the real new world order, yeah. Exactly. So at this stage of the game,
[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:56.720]  some people who have different plans for the United States being the hegemon, well, you
[2:03:56.720 --> 2:04:02.720]  know, they are turning to countries and telling them. And that's why Biden said no, America will
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:06.720]  leave the new world order, not Russia and China. Yeah, but you've got to give something in return,
[2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:11.720]  not just threaten people with an atomic bomb. Okay. So you know, look at Latin America, how
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:16.720]  United States treated, as you said, correctly, Mexico and so on. So it's, it's, but yeah,
[2:04:16.720 --> 2:04:21.720]  the Anglo American banking system never delivers real development. It delivers debt and China
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:27.720]  and Russia are delivering development. Yeah, right now, Alex, when you see all the sanctions,
[2:04:27.720 --> 2:04:33.720]  all the financial threats that are being thrown at Russia, you're seeing the fact that the
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:38.720]  money lenders that I mentioned to you so long ago, they shouldn't be running the world. But
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.720]  now the money lenders are coming out saying, Hey, listen, you're going to count out to
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:46.720]  what we tell you with regards to other two elderly people and pension payments, or whether
[2:04:46.720 --> 2:04:51.720]  it be the stock market being sustained, or, you know, fiat currency controls. And so
[2:04:51.720 --> 2:05:16.720]  I hear the great points is always Carlos will be right back. Stay with us.
[2:05:16.720 --> 2:05:42.720]  Thank you.
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:57.720]  Thank you.
[2:06:13.720 --> 2:06:17.720]  All right, I'm only mentioning this every hour, because we're getting literally thousands
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:22.720]  of calls to the office, tens of thousands of emails, I got family friends calling. Am I
[2:06:22.720 --> 2:06:28.720]  okay? Am I sick? What happened? Monday, Dr. Ben Marble was here, and I'm going back to
[2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:33.720]  your calls in just a moment. And during the break, I was kind of sweating and acting weird
[2:06:33.720 --> 2:06:37.720]  and kind of, I wasn't making a big deal about this to people because it only been happening
[2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:44.720]  for a couple of days off and on. He said, What's wrong? I said, I'm dizzy. And he said,
[2:06:44.720 --> 2:06:47.720]  Oh, I bet it's your heart. I'm not putting Marble down, but it wasn't my heart. So I
[2:06:47.720 --> 2:06:52.720]  went and got a test. And he asked me, Oh, how does it happen? What's happening? This
[2:06:52.720 --> 2:06:57.720]  and that. He said, You need to go to the emergency room right now to rule that out. I said, No,
[2:06:57.720 --> 2:07:00.720]  I'm not going. He said, Well, let me at least call this doctor. I know that's diagnosed.
[2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:03.720]  He should send you there. When's the last time you're in your heart check, blah, blah,
[2:07:03.720 --> 2:07:08.720]  blah. And I said, Well, years ago. So I finally got it on Wednesday. They did the scans and
[2:07:08.720 --> 2:07:12.720]  took me up to all this stuff, EKGs and now basically said I was great. And they took
[2:07:12.720 --> 2:07:17.720]  16 things of blood, a bunch of tests, half of them come in showing I'm fine there. But
[2:07:17.720 --> 2:07:22.720]  I figured out by yesterday, I had a really bad sinus infection. So as soon as I got on
[2:07:22.720 --> 2:07:27.720]  antibiotics for it and everything else, last night just boom, there was like a blockage
[2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:32.720]  up there. And that was why my middle ear was like, I mean, when I told him, he said,
[2:07:32.720 --> 2:07:36.720]  No, what do you feel like it's when I'm dizzy? Well, how bad it is? I said, Well, I almost
[2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:40.720]  ran off the road coming to work this morning, because I literally had to start pulling over
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:45.720]  because I was like, dizzy. He goes, Oh my God, that's probably your heart. You got to go.
[2:07:45.720 --> 2:07:50.720]  So they're like, you're going to depositions Wednesday and Thursday. No, I said, Well, I
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:53.720]  can't go to the doctor. I can't go Wednesday either. And he goes, Why? I got deposition.
[2:07:53.720 --> 2:07:57.720]  He goes, You're crazy. I'll write you a note. You're dizzy. You're sweating. You've got
[2:07:57.720 --> 2:08:03.720]  to do this. And so that's what happened. And I've already done three depositions with
[2:08:03.720 --> 2:08:07.720]  these people. They've got everything. They just scream and yell and claim all this stuff
[2:08:07.720 --> 2:08:11.720]  because the Democratic Party wants to end the First Amendment and the second. They admit
[2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:16.720]  that they've got rigged courts and they're just salivating to have a show trial, you
[2:08:16.720 --> 2:08:21.720]  know, supposedly starting here in Texas on the 25th of April. And it was just shameful.
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:24.720]  I mean, they have changed. We now learn I said five times yesterday. That's what I knew
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:29.720]  of them eight times. They've changed deposition dates a few days before we do that. And we
[2:08:29.720 --> 2:08:33.720]  are the scum of the earth, man. I mean, you can be a child molester, Democrat judges
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:38.720]  let you out, no charges or let you go. You can do whatever you want. But if you're if
[2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:42.720]  you walk outside the Capitol, they put you in jail. If you were inside, you get a year
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:49.720]  solitary confinement, no trial because these are just monsters, absolute monsters that
[2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:54.720]  have no chivalry, no governor, no nothing. They're just abusing the power they have over
[2:08:54.720 --> 2:09:01.720]  us. And it's not going to end. Well, I can tell you what a mess. And then I mean, because
[2:09:01.720 --> 2:09:05.720]  I get my phone's ring off. Okay, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah, I didn't
[2:09:05.720 --> 2:09:10.720]  know what was going on. And I've had earrings off and on my whole life, you know, swimming
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:15.720]  a river, don't clean your ears out, get a bacterial infection. But I've never had vertigo
[2:09:15.720 --> 2:09:20.720]  like this. And I don't want to make a big deal about it. And I got some other issues like
[2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:24.720]  polyps in my throat. So my voice is so, you know, so I was about to get that done this
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:29.720]  week, but I had to postpone that because of this. And then just to see them then claim,
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:34.720]  no, you don't have a medical condition. You are going to go to our thing. It's just it's
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:40.720]  it's the it's the entitlement of the left. They think they own us and they don't. All
[2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:51.720]  right, it's been holding the longest here. Hmm. That would be Mary in New Jersey, Mary
[2:09:51.720 --> 2:09:59.720]  thanks for holding. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. Hi, welcome. Hi, Alex. I really want to say,
[2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:03.720]  I mean, you just happened to be talking about your health. And that's why I was calling
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:08.720]  because, you know, Alex, there's so many people who love you, as you said, they've been calling
[2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:13.720]  you, but all of us are coming with you to those depositions. Believe me, if there was
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:18.720]  some way that we could do it physically. I mean, I can't. I'm in in Jersey. I'm not
[2:10:18.720 --> 2:10:22.720]  even worried about it. It's all it's all a joke, little fame seeking, nobody lawyers.
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.720]  I mean, Blumenthal runs it all. He's a famous stolen glory guy who was in combat in
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.720]  Vietnam, never went to Vietnam. It's just they're all just a bunch of scum. I mean,
[2:10:30.720 --> 2:10:35.720]  I'm not even worried about them. The war, the food shortages, the inflation is what
[2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:41.720]  matters. It's just how they make it a huge national issue. You know, it shows how scared
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:45.720]  they are of our populism and our freedom. But you called in about food shortages.
[2:10:45.720 --> 2:10:50.720]  Mary, what do you want to say about that? Well, with what was going on with what
[2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:54.720]  Biden said, I mean, we've gotten to the point with our leaders that they're just
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:11:00.720]  kind of allowed to say, oh, this is what it is. A food shortage is like I would think
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:05.720]  that for president, that's one of the top, you know, food security is one of the top
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:09.720]  things for them. So at what point he just nonchalantly says, yeah, it's going to get
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:13.720]  real bad. Our sanctions on Russia are sanctions on you. But then you know, it's
[2:11:13.720 --> 2:11:18.720]  really an environmental corporate great reset sanction like locking us in our houses
[2:11:18.720 --> 2:11:23.720]  like saying we're not essential. All of that is globalist. The great reset is
[2:11:23.720 --> 2:11:29.720]  sanctions on humanity by a bunch of greedy inbred children of Nazis. You can't
[2:11:29.720 --> 2:11:33.720]  make it up. But what I'm trying to say is that if people were saying something
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:37.720]  like, well, you know what, he's not even being a leader, we should impeach him.
[2:11:37.720 --> 2:11:41.720]  There's always this there's so much drama surrounding things. And the reality is to
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:46.720]  say, Biden, listen, if you can't handle this, the food insecurity thing, let's make
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:50.720]  a group of people who are specialists on it so that we could just know that the
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:11:55.720]  that we're being taken care of. This is not an acceptable answer. We are your CEO
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:12:00.720]  and CEO would not accept that answer. So I really, I mean, I'm going to be doing my
[2:12:00.720 --> 2:12:03.720]  own writing about this and just expressing myself. That's awesome. Where do people
[2:12:03.720 --> 2:12:08.720]  read your writing, Mary? Well, I haven't, I haven't done it. I mean, I would like to
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:13.720]  do it. It doesn't matter where you do it, whether it's wherever you can just do it.
[2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:16.720]  And Mary, we appreciate you have a beautiful voice. God bless you. My cram is
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  when he calls as possible. Johnny in Tennessee, Johnny, go ahead.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:26.720]  Hey, hey, brother, go ahead. Thank you. With the bug. Oh, come on, my father, baby.
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:31.720]  Do you remember Lion King with the bugs? The lion goes off into the pride and gets
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:35.720]  convinced and bugs is a good way. So he learns to stop eating meat and learns to
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:44.720]  eat maggots with with kumba or who's the farting warthog? Pumba. Yeah, Pumba.
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:48.720]  Man, they've been programming us for a while, haven't they?
[2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:53.720]  Well, I remember he goes back to the pride. Absolutely.
[2:12:53.720 --> 2:12:58.720]  So that's just something funny, but I wanted to talk about the founding fathers
[2:12:58.720 --> 2:13:04.720]  and legislation. I think my projection within five to 10 years, we're going to
[2:13:04.720 --> 2:13:11.720]  have a Supreme Court have to decide on legislation from the Civil War and
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:20.720]  Revolutionary Era. Elaborate on that. So that's why the Supreme Court is so
[2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:29.720]  important. These last few trials, as we know, the 3% rule will affect how
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:34.720]  history is written. If you go back to the Revolutionary War, technically what
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:39.720]  the founding fathers did was illegal under the rule of law. So what I'm
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:46.720]  seeing in the next few years, I think between the Declaration of Independence
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:53.720]  where it says about a long train of abuses and usurpations, evincing a
[2:13:53.720 --> 2:14:00.720]  design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it's a right in duty.
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:09.720]  So when you, I think something like that is going to go against the 18 U.S. code
[2:14:09.720 --> 2:14:13.720]  2383 under rebellions and insurrections.
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:17.720]  Well, that's right. The Declaration of Independence overrides all these laws
[2:14:17.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  saying we came in protest as insurrection. We have a right to revolt.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:24.720]  And a lot of states actually like New Hampshire have it in their state
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:28.720]  constitution, the right to revolt. It is not just our right, it is our duty to
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:33.720]  get rid of systems of government that oppress us.
[2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:38.720]  Exactly. It clearly, I'd recommend everyone of me to see the obvious thing.
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:44.720]  Go back and read there. It clearly states exactly what's happening.
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:48.720]  But really quick, I think what's going to happen is a redeclaration of
[2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:54.720]  independence is going to go around online somewhere about five years from now.
[2:14:54.720 --> 2:15:00.720]  And it can go either two ways because with the 3% rule right now,
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:03.720]  that's about 15 million people that change history.
[2:15:03.720 --> 2:15:08.720]  I see that will either be shut down or we'll see.
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:11.720]  And with tracking, who knows what that list could be used for.
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:13.720]  Well, that's right. And the left knows that.
[2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:16.720]  So they're a tiny minority of behavioral psychologists that want absolute power,
[2:15:16.720 --> 2:15:20.720]  posing as good guys, taking over and engaging in incredible crime.
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:23.720]  Thank you so much for the call, sir. Great points.
[2:15:23.720 --> 2:15:28.720]  All right. The great Roger Stone is on the road in New Jersey, New York.
[2:15:28.720 --> 2:15:33.720]  I'm not sure where, but he's going to exclusively respond to this Trump suit
[2:15:33.720 --> 2:15:37.720]  that he's all over against the deep state and their whole Russia hoax.
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:41.720]  And why that is so important because they're betting the whole midterms
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:45.720]  in 228 days on terror attacks that are imminent from, you know,
[2:15:45.720 --> 2:15:48.720]  Roger Stone and myself and others. Absolute BS.
[2:15:48.720 --> 2:15:53.720]  But Roger Stone, straight ahead, stay with us.
[2:16:18.720 --> 2:16:21.720]  It's more important than ever to take the tools God gave us

[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:28.720]  The Samoan people would drink Kava Tea during social gatherings
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:31.720]  and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:17:31.720 --> 2:17:36.720]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:17:36.720 --> 2:17:40.720]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:44.720]  of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[2:17:44.720 --> 2:17:49.720]  German Kama Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:52.720]  If you expect to sell this new product quickly,
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:57.720]  so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarsstore.com.
[2:17:57.720 --> 2:18:01.720]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[2:18:01.720 --> 2:18:04.720]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be,
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:08.720]  but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:12.720]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:14.720]  to give me that energy I need to get going.
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:17.720]  You know, besides the energy Turbo Force,
[2:18:17.720 --> 2:18:20.720]  giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy,
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:24.720]  and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy,
[2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:27.720]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[2:18:27.720 --> 2:18:31.720]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Sorilis.
[2:18:31.720 --> 2:18:33.720]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.720]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now,
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:40.720]  plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:44.720]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:47.720]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon,
[2:18:47.720 --> 2:18:51.720]  good news, Turbo Force, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need
[2:18:51.720 --> 2:19:17.720]  for every day and Sorilis can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[2:19:17.720 --> 2:19:19.720]  Brother, I'm so glad you called, elaborate on this.
[2:19:19.720 --> 2:19:22.720]  Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:24.720]  to write something on the bathroom wall,
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:28.720]  or to put a sticker on your car, or banner hangs over highways,
[2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:30.720]  and it will be a chain reaction.
[2:19:30.720 --> 2:19:32.720]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:33.720]  I have a few ideas.
[2:19:33.720 --> 2:19:35.720]  First of all, health care is really important.
[2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:36.720]  It's not a form.
[2:19:36.720 --> 2:19:38.720]  Arrest out, arrest out, swap.
[2:19:38.720 --> 2:19:39.720]  The vaccine is poison.
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:40.720]  There's tons of things.
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:41.720]  I say keep it short, keep it concise.
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:42.720]  No, I agree.
[2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:44.720]  Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates.
[2:19:44.720 --> 2:19:46.720]  The COVID-19 vaccine is poison.
[2:19:46.720 --> 2:19:47.720]  Beautiful.
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:49.720]  The reason we could all be involved is we could all be affected,
[2:19:49.720 --> 2:19:51.720]  so that's what I'm calling about.
[2:19:51.720 --> 2:19:52.720]  God bless you, Chris.
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.720]  In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[2:19:55.720 --> 2:20:24.720]  Thank you so much.
[2:20:25.720 --> 2:20:54.720]  Show me it.
[2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:59.720]  Well, I was just talking to Roger Stone yesterday.
[2:20:59.720 --> 2:21:00.720]  He was in New Jersey.
[2:21:00.720 --> 2:21:02.720]  He asked him to come on.
[2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:05.720]  He couldn't go on a show because he was on the road,
[2:21:05.720 --> 2:21:09.720]  but now he's joining us to respond to this huge lawsuit
[2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:12.720]  that Trump has filed, really detailing the criminal activity
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:14.720]  of the deep state against President Trump
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:16.720]  and the American people.
[2:21:16.720 --> 2:21:19.720]  Our electoral process, true election meddling,
[2:21:19.720 --> 2:21:21.720]  documented here, and I asked where he is.
[2:21:21.720 --> 2:21:26.720]  Well, he is in Connecticut visiting his parents' grave sites.
[2:21:26.720 --> 2:21:30.720]  And so thank you so much, Roger Stone, for joining us.
[2:21:30.720 --> 2:21:34.720]  Let's get right into this and some of these other big issues.
[2:21:34.720 --> 2:21:38.720]  Well, Alex, this is an extraordinarily shrewd move
[2:21:38.720 --> 2:21:40.720]  by Donald Trump.
[2:21:40.720 --> 2:21:43.720]  When Trump is good, he's really, really good.
[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:46.720]  And this has both, in my opinion, a legal value
[2:21:46.720 --> 2:21:50.720]  and a very large political value.
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:52.720]  You read the president's complaint.
[2:21:52.720 --> 2:21:56.720]  First of all, he's filed this as a RICO action.
[2:21:56.720 --> 2:21:59.720]  He basically accuses Hillary Clinton
[2:21:59.720 --> 2:22:03.720]  and her entire criminal cabal of racketeering,
[2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:06.720]  and that he lays out methodically,
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:09.720]  on almost on a timeline basis,
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:13.720]  the entire effort to destroy his presidency,
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:18.720]  the use of fabricated evidence in both the steel dossier
[2:22:18.720 --> 2:22:21.720]  and the so-called crowd strikes report,
[2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:24.720]  the creation of the fabricated narrative
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:27.720]  that the Russians hacked the DNC
[2:22:27.720 --> 2:22:30.720]  and somehow gave the fruits of that hack
[2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:33.720]  to the Trump campaign, the involvement,
[2:22:33.720 --> 2:22:38.720]  the illicit involvement of both the FBI and the CIA.
[2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:42.720]  This is a brilliant PR move, if not a brilliant legal move.
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:47.720]  Now, specifically, he filed this in the Southern District of Florida,
[2:22:47.720 --> 2:22:52.720]  where he appointed seven of the 10 federal judges in the circuit.
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:56.720]  Needless to say, it immediately is assigned to a judge
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:01.720]  appointed by President Bill Clinton, Donald M. Middlebrooks.
[2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:06.720]  It never, it never evens the magic judicial power they have.
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:08.720]  No, it's really amazing.
[2:23:08.720 --> 2:23:11.720]  It's supposed to be, as you know, done randomly.
[2:23:11.720 --> 2:23:17.720]  Middlebrooks is known as the king of the docket rocket.
[2:23:17.720 --> 2:23:20.720]  He is known for making quick decisions
[2:23:20.720 --> 2:23:25.720]  of moving the backlog of cases in front of him very quickly.
[2:23:25.720 --> 2:23:29.720]  He's not known as a terribly political judge.
[2:23:29.720 --> 2:23:34.720]  Republicans, I spoke to him this morning, respect a judge Middlebrook,
[2:23:34.720 --> 2:23:37.720]  but the real question on the legal front is
[2:23:37.720 --> 2:23:40.720]  whether he will quickly dismiss the lawsuit.
[2:23:40.720 --> 2:23:45.720]  I would argue whether he dismisses it or not is almost irrelevant.
[2:23:45.720 --> 2:23:47.720]  What Trump has done here is brilliant.
[2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:50.720]  Their narrative for the election is January 6th.
[2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:56.720]  Our narrative is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama,
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:02.720]  and the greatest single political dirty trick in American history.
[2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:04.720]  No, they call me a dirty trickster.
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:08.720]  Well, I reject that, but if we assume it's true,
[2:24:08.720 --> 2:24:12.720]  then it takes one to no one and the Russian collusion hoax
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:15.720]  is the greatest political scandal in our history.
[2:24:15.720 --> 2:24:18.720]  It makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[2:24:18.720 --> 2:24:21.720]  They claim the American people electing Trump was really the Russians
[2:24:21.720 --> 2:24:26.720]  and thus are trying to steal an election retroactively from the American people.
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:28.720]  It's outrageous criminal activity.
[2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:30.720]  Not only that, but more importantly,
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:33.720]  the whole goal of the Russian collusion hoax
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:36.720]  is to hide their own crimes in Ukraine,
[2:24:36.720 --> 2:24:39.720]  to hide their own crimes in Russia.
[2:24:39.720 --> 2:24:42.720]  As I've said previously, and I have no fear of lawsuit,
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.720]  Hillary Clinton and her cabal, John Podesta and others,
[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:50.720]  made millions from the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:54.720]  Millions in banking, millions in oil and gas,
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:24:56.720]  millions in insurance,
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:58.720]  and to hide those crimes,
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:03.720]  to hide the sale of control of America's stockpiles of uranium,
[2:25:03.720 --> 2:25:08.720]  for example, it is right out of the Olinsky playbook.
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:11.720]  And let's expand on that.
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:13.720]  I don't think there's a deal between them and Putin,
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:16.720]  but by Biden saying, go ahead and they won't do anything, he does it.
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:20.720]  Now the sanctions only help India and help China
[2:25:20.720 --> 2:25:23.720]  with all the oil and fertilizer Russia sells them.
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:25.720]  This isn't even going to hurt Russia, they admit.
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:29.720]  It hurts us and Biden's on TV saying it's a sanctuary on you
[2:25:29.720 --> 2:25:31.720]  while he shuts down our pipelines.
[2:25:31.720 --> 2:25:35.720]  Why is the left trying to bankrupt America to make us controllable?
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.720]  I think that's exactly what it is.
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:39.720]  If you examine the sanctions,
[2:25:39.720 --> 2:25:43.720]  American banks are specifically exempted
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:45.720]  when it comes to energy deals
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:51.720]  where Americans are buying crude and oil and gas from the Russians.
[2:25:51.720 --> 2:25:55.720]  So all we're really doing is financing Putin
[2:25:55.720 --> 2:25:58.720]  at the same time we claim to be sanctioning him.
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:01.720]  And this is what I'm really sick of, Alex,
[2:26:01.720 --> 2:26:04.720]  going online and saying that I'm pro-Putin or pro-Russian.
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:06.720]  No, I'm actually pro-American.
[2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:10.720]  So if you're not in favor of putting offensive missiles in Ukraine,
[2:26:10.720 --> 2:26:11.720]  pointed at Russia,
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.720]  if you're not in favor of taxpayer financing of 15 bio weapons labs,
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.720]  cooking up God knows what pestilence to dump on the Russian people,
[2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:22.720]  that makes you pro-Russian.
[2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:24.720]  No, it makes you against World War III.
[2:26:24.720 --> 2:26:28.720]  Great. I saw Bill O'Reilly attacking you and I
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:31.720]  and Tucker Carlson for being pro-Russian.
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:33.720]  How do you raise that?
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:35.720]  I was literally sending that image to the producer.
[2:26:35.720 --> 2:26:36.720]  I forgot to send it to him.
[2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:38.720]  Here, I'll just show TV viewers.
[2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:40.720]  Look at this, folks.
[2:26:40.720 --> 2:26:41.720]  Bill O'Reilly says,
[2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:45.720]  support for Putin among United States pundits.
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:47.720]  Tucker Carlson is number one. I'm jealous.
[2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:49.720]  Roger Stone is number two. I'm jealous.
[2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:50.720]  Alex Jones is number three.
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:53.720]  J.D. Vance, Tulsi Gabbard and Candace Owens,
[2:26:53.720 --> 2:26:56.720]  all because we're just being honest about everything.
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:26:58.720]  Unbelievable.
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:00.720]  Is Bill O'Reilly actually still alive?
[2:27:00.720 --> 2:27:01.720]  I'm not aware of whether he...
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:03.720]  Is he actually still alive?
[2:27:03.720 --> 2:27:05.720]  Because I haven't seen the guy in years.
[2:27:05.720 --> 2:27:06.720]  He's not a conservative.
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:09.720]  Well, he crashed and destroyed Trump's rallies.
[2:27:09.720 --> 2:27:10.720]  No one wanted to buy the tickets.
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:11.720]  They were all a big failure.
[2:27:11.720 --> 2:27:12.720]  They had to give the tickets away.
[2:27:12.720 --> 2:27:13.720]  I mean, he's literally...
[2:27:13.720 --> 2:27:15.720]  I mean, look at this.
[2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:16.720]  Oh, we're support Putin.
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:18.720]  I don't support the invasion.
[2:27:18.720 --> 2:27:19.720]  I've been against it from day one,
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:21.720]  but I've shown how Soros Brad,
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:23.720]  he got Putin to attack.
[2:27:23.720 --> 2:27:26.720]  I don't like poking the bear either.
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:29.720]  Well, a man is known by the company he keeps.
[2:27:29.720 --> 2:27:32.720]  And if I'm with Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones,
[2:27:32.720 --> 2:27:33.720]  I'm in great company.
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:37.720]  Bill O'Reilly has no credibility and no audience.
[2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:38.720]  I would argue he has no talent,
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:39.720]  but that's a separate behavior.
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:40.720]  Well, he's also a pervert.
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:42.720]  He doesn't even know how to pick up women either.
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  All those creepy transcripts
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:46.720]  of how he would like harass his employees.
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:47.720]  I mean, yeah.
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:49.720]  That guy's got no game.
[2:27:49.720 --> 2:27:50.720]  Yeah.
[2:27:50.720 --> 2:27:51.720]  I've worked...
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:53.720]  No, it's really disgraceful.
[2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:56.720]  Look, the thing I hate about being accused
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:27:59.720]  of being a Russian stooge is I had family members
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:03.720]  mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:07.720]  I am 100% like you, Alex, pro-American.
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.720]  And I will step aside to no one
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:12.720]  when it comes to doing what's best for our country.
[2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:15.720]  But this war in Ukraine is not about the United States.
[2:28:15.720 --> 2:28:18.720]  It's about the New World Order.
[2:28:18.720 --> 2:28:21.720]  It is about covering up the corruption
[2:28:21.720 --> 2:28:23.720]  of the Ukrainian piggy bank,
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:26.720]  which had been used by Hunter Biden and the Bidens
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:28.720]  and the Obamas and the Clintons.
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:29.720]  I agree.
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:30.720]  So where does Trump go from here?
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:31.720]  Because I was reading this lawsuit last night.
[2:28:31.720 --> 2:28:32.720]  I probably read half of it.
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:33.720]  It's like, it's a book.
[2:28:33.720 --> 2:28:34.720]  Trump ought to publish.
[2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:35.720]  This is a book.
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:37.720]  I mean, this is really riveting.
[2:28:37.720 --> 2:28:38.720]  Plus, I've researched it all,
[2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:39.720]  so I know how accurate it is.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:42.720]  But this reminded me of the damn crimes they committed.
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:43.720]  And you're all over this thing
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:45.720]  and the stuff they did to you.
[2:28:45.720 --> 2:28:48.720]  Yeah, that's why I think it's important that he's memorialized it.
[2:28:48.720 --> 2:28:50.720]  Peter Tickton, the lawyer handling this for him,
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:52.720]  is a very able fellow, friend of mine.
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:53.720]  Hey, stay there, Roger.
[2:28:53.720 --> 2:28:57.720]  We're going to come right back and talk about more.
[2:28:57.720 --> 2:28:58.720]  You know, it's a fact.
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:00.720]  And I'm not bragging when I say it.
[2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:03.720]  It's just true that M4 Wars is seen by the globalist
[2:29:03.720 --> 2:29:06.720]  as the standard of human liberty,
[2:29:06.720 --> 2:29:11.720]  as the logo of human populist resistance
[2:29:11.720 --> 2:29:14.720]  against their transhumanist anti-human program.
[2:29:14.720 --> 2:29:18.720]  And man, our work is really right now hitting
[2:29:18.720 --> 2:29:21.720]  the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[2:29:21.720 --> 2:29:24.720]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:27.720]  we've got great products, thousands of them,
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:28.720]  at M4WarsTour.com.
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:31.720]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:34.720]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.720]  because this fight has intensified.
[2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:39.720]  Don't need me to tell you that at M4WarsTour.com.
[2:29:39.720 --> 2:29:43.720]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[2:29:43.720 --> 2:29:45.720]  Things have been sold out for a long time,
[2:29:45.720 --> 2:29:48.720]  like M4WarsLife, fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing,
[2:29:48.720 --> 2:29:52.720]  and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:29:52.720 --> 2:29:57.720]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at M4WarsTour.com right now.
[2:29:57.720 --> 2:30:01.720]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc
[2:30:01.720 --> 2:30:04.720]  are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[2:30:04.720 --> 2:30:07.720]  M4Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough
[2:30:07.720 --> 2:30:10.720]  in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:14.720]  This M4WarsLife offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[2:30:14.720 --> 2:30:17.720]  should be your next purchase from the M4Wars store.
[2:30:17.720 --> 2:30:20.720]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower
[2:30:20.720 --> 2:30:24.720]  just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[2:30:24.720 --> 2:30:27.720]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful
[2:30:27.720 --> 2:30:29.720]  for a variety of health conditions,
[2:30:29.720 --> 2:30:31.720]  including those with osteoarthritis
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:34.720]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[2:30:34.720 --> 2:30:37.720]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:40.720]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[2:30:40.720 --> 2:30:44.720]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[2:30:44.720 --> 2:30:47.720]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:50.720]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:54.720]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at M4WarsTour.com
[2:30:54.720 --> 2:30:57.720]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[2:31:30.720 --> 2:31:32.720]  loatium root, and more.

[2:31:51.720 --> 2:31:53.720]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:31:53.720 --> 2:32:04.720]  Take action now at M4WarsTour.com.
[2:32:23.720 --> 2:32:51.720]  The M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars.
[2:32:54.720 --> 2:32:58.720]  The M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars M4Wars
[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:03.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:33:03.720 --> 2:33:05.720]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:09.720 --> 2:33:14.720]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones
[2:33:14.720 --> 2:33:18.720]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:22.720]  All right, in the final segment of the Roger Stone here,
[2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:23.720]  and then I'll come back and take your calls
[2:33:23.720 --> 2:33:25.720]  and cover breaking news.
[2:33:25.720 --> 2:33:26.720]  I want to ask him what's front and center,
[2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:28.720]  as I always say on his radar screen,
[2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:32.720]  but obviously Roger, you and I were talking this morning some.
[2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:34.720]  I'm not ready to release this information yet,
[2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:35.720]  but I told you about it,
[2:33:35.720 --> 2:33:37.720]  what's going on with the Justice Department
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:38.720]  and other things.
[2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:41.720]  And just 228 days out from the election,
[2:33:41.720 --> 2:33:43.720]  they're betting everything on this.
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:45.720]  They put out their terror report last June saying,
[2:33:45.720 --> 2:33:48.720]  it's not Islamic terrorists, it's not Russians,
[2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:50.720]  it's not Chinese, it's not Mexican mafia,
[2:33:50.720 --> 2:33:53.720]  it's people that question elections and lock-downs.
[2:33:53.720 --> 2:33:55.720]  Now they last week put out another report saying,
[2:33:55.720 --> 2:33:59.720]  imminent terror attacks from people questioning the election.
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:02.720]  So it's pretty clear, blow stuff up, shoot up a church,
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:04.720]  say it's because this election was stolen from Trump,
[2:34:04.720 --> 2:34:06.720]  then they steal the midterm,
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:09.720]  and anybody that questions midterm fraud is a terrorist.
[2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:11.720]  I mean, this is not hard to see where they're going.
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:14.720]  Do you agree with that, and how do we counter that?
[2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:16.720]  I totally agree with that, Alex.
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:19.720]  What you have going on right now from a macro point of view
[2:34:19.720 --> 2:34:21.720]  is a struggle over the narrative.
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:25.720]  The last narrative is January 6th is an insurrection.
[2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:29.720]  I came to New York because they are trying to terminate
[2:34:29.720 --> 2:34:32.720]  a fine American police officer, a brave officer.
[2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:33.720]  Oh, I meant to bring that up.
[2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:35.720]  A great guy that volunteered as a security guy,
[2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:37.720]  met him, had dinner with you guys, a great guy.
[2:34:37.720 --> 2:34:38.720]  Tell us about that.
[2:34:38.720 --> 2:34:41.720]  Yeah, Sal Greco, a New York police officer
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:44.720]  who has served honorably for 14 years,
[2:34:44.720 --> 2:34:47.720]  has an unblemished record of patrolling
[2:34:47.720 --> 2:34:51.720]  in some of the most dangerous and undesirable precincts in New York.
[2:34:51.720 --> 2:34:55.720]  The graveyard shift now is being considered for termination
[2:34:55.720 --> 2:34:57.720]  and termination of his pension
[2:34:57.720 --> 2:35:01.720]  because he was with us on January 5th and 6th.
[2:35:01.720 --> 2:35:02.720]  We're going to have to go to court.
[2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:05.720]  You can help this guy and help this New York cop.com.
[2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:08.720]  This guy is a great Italian American from Staten Island.
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:10.720]  He's done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:13.720]  This is yet another political...
[2:35:13.720 --> 2:35:16.720]  And to be clear, the current mayor
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:19.720]  was Mike Tyson's security guard, which is great, wonderful,
[2:35:19.720 --> 2:35:21.720]  when Mike is a felon.
[2:35:21.720 --> 2:35:24.720]  But they're claiming because you're a felon with a commuted sentence
[2:35:24.720 --> 2:35:27.720]  and pardoned that he's going to lose his job
[2:35:27.720 --> 2:35:28.720]  because he's friends with you.
[2:35:28.720 --> 2:35:31.720]  I mean, this is just more McCarthyite BS.
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:32.720]  That's exactly right.
[2:35:32.720 --> 2:35:35.720]  So Mayor Eric Adams, who was a New York police captain,
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:37.720]  provided security for Mike Tyson.
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:39.720]  When he was a convicted felon,
[2:35:39.720 --> 2:35:40.720]  it was investigated.
[2:35:40.720 --> 2:35:43.720]  He was cleared and he paid no penalty whatsoever.
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:46.720]  But in the case of Sal Greco, because he's a Trump supporter
[2:35:46.720 --> 2:35:48.720]  and a friend of mine,
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:52.720]  he stands to lose the $250,000 that he's paid into a pension fund.
[2:35:52.720 --> 2:35:53.720]  It's outrageous.
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:35:55.720]  It'll end up in the federal courts.
[2:35:55.720 --> 2:35:58.720]  Mayor Adams will end up on the stand.
[2:35:58.720 --> 2:36:00.720]  By the way, I want to ask the police commissioner,
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:03.720]  if nobody at NYPD has any communications
[2:36:03.720 --> 2:36:04.720]  with any convicted felons,
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:07.720]  how do their street informants work?
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:09.720]  Exactly how does that work?
[2:36:09.720 --> 2:36:10.720]  It's a load of crap.
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:11.720]  Let me ask you about this.
[2:36:11.720 --> 2:36:13.720]  A great jurist compared to the Democrats,
[2:36:13.720 --> 2:36:15.720]  Clarence Thomas, and his wife's amazing.
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:17.720]  She's sending text messages to the White House,
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:19.720]  even staff saying, hey, look at this fraud, do something.
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:22.720]  That's her right as an American to call for investigation.
[2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:24.720]  They're trying to call her into January 6th
[2:36:24.720 --> 2:36:25.720]  and have her messages now
[2:36:25.720 --> 2:36:27.720]  and are demonizing Clarence Thomas.
[2:36:27.720 --> 2:36:30.720]  I mean, this is just getting insane.
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:33.720]  Yeah, this is an entire trend that's very disturbing.
[2:36:33.720 --> 2:36:36.720]  Take constitutionally protected free speech
[2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:39.720]  and constitutionally protected political activity,
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:41.720]  including the right to free assembly,
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:44.720]  and somehow try to criminalize it.
[2:36:44.720 --> 2:36:47.720]  Ginny Thomas has the right to send a text message
[2:36:47.720 --> 2:36:50.720]  with her political views to anyone she wants.
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:51.720]  It's not seditious.
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:52.720]  It's not treasonous.
[2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:53.720]  It's not illegal.
[2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:55.720]  It's not even improper.
[2:36:55.720 --> 2:36:57.720]  It's her right as an American.
[2:36:57.720 --> 2:36:59.720]  They want to outlaw questioning elections
[2:36:59.720 --> 2:37:00.720]  because they're stealing them everywhere
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:02.720]  and the poll numbers and facts show that.
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:04.720]  So I told you probably this morning,
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:05.720]  we're not going to release it yet.
[2:37:05.720 --> 2:37:06.720]  We're going to release it next week.
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:08.720]  What do you make of the latest stuff
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:09.720]  with the Justice Department
[2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:10.720]  and what they're trying around here?
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:12.720]  I mean, this is getting comical.
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:13.720]  It's so evil.
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:16.720]  Well, I think it's very obvious, for example,
[2:37:16.720 --> 2:37:19.720]  that the prosecution of Owen Schreuer
[2:37:19.720 --> 2:37:21.720]  is a complete and total fraud.
[2:37:21.720 --> 2:37:24.720]  Owen Schreuer's done nothing whatsoever wrong,
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:25.720]  never entered the building,
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:27.720]  wasn't in a restricted area,
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:28.720]  wasn't on a bullhorn,
[2:37:28.720 --> 2:37:30.720]  didn't say anything incendiary in public
[2:37:30.720 --> 2:37:32.720]  or on social media.
[2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:35.720]  Owen Schreuer is a victim because he's an American
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:38.720]  because he was there to peacefully protest
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:41.720]  and hope to get a 10-day delay
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:43.720]  in the certification of Joe Biden
[2:37:43.720 --> 2:37:45.720]  as President of the United States
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:47.720]  so that we could more thoroughly examine
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:50.720]  the fraudulent results in Georgia,
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:54.720]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona.
[2:37:54.720 --> 2:37:56.720]  That's his right as an American, Alex,
[2:37:56.720 --> 2:37:58.720]  but they're going to try to use that,
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:01.720]  I think, to pressure him, to pressure you,
[2:38:01.720 --> 2:38:03.720]  to pressure me, to pressure anybody.
[2:38:03.720 --> 2:38:05.720]  It's all guilt by association.
[2:38:05.720 --> 2:38:06.720]  Yeah, we're not going to break it yet,
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:08.720]  but I always said, well, they're dumb if they think,
[2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:10.720]  you know, Owen will lie about me,
[2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:11.720]  which of course he wouldn't,
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:14.720]  but instead it's, we're going to put Owen in prison
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:15.720]  unless you do what we want.
[2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:16.720]  I mean, I just, these people,
[2:38:16.720 --> 2:38:19.720]  the fact that they say this over telephones to you,
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:22.720]  it's like they just have no shame.
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:23.720]  No, it's unbelievable.
[2:38:23.720 --> 2:38:26.720]  And guilt by association is their favorite tactic.
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:29.720]  In other words, Roger Stone has spoken to the president,
[2:38:29.720 --> 2:38:31.720]  yes, and Roger Stone has met,
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:34.720]  and Riketario of the Proud Boys, yes.
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:36.720]  Therefore, no, therefore nothing.
[2:38:36.720 --> 2:38:38.720]  The worst guy at this, by the way,
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:40.720]  is Ari Melber on MSNBC.
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:43.720]  So let's use his logic for a moment.
[2:38:43.720 --> 2:38:45.720]  Ari Melber works at NBC.
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:48.720]  He's a colleague and friend of Matt Lauer.
[2:38:48.720 --> 2:38:51.720]  Matt Lauer has been accused of anally assaulting,
[2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:54.720]  anally raping and assaulting women.
[2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:57.720]  Does that mean that Ari Melber has also done so?
[2:38:57.720 --> 2:39:00.720]  Well, by his reasoning, the answer would be yes.
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:02.720]  See, that's guilt by association.
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:03.720]  It's unfair.
[2:39:03.720 --> 2:39:04.720]  It's outrageous.
[2:39:04.720 --> 2:39:08.720]  Yeah, he's not raping women in their, in their rear ends.
[2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:11.720]  But by their yardstick, yes.
[2:39:11.720 --> 2:39:12.720]  Yeah.
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:13.720]  Yeah.
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:17.720]  I mean, look, I, I resent that insinuendo, as they used to say.
[2:39:17.720 --> 2:39:19.720]  But that is the reasoning of the left.
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:21.720]  It's all guilt by association.
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:24.720]  Because you know, A, and you met B,
[2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:27.720]  then you must have discussed the assault on the Capitol.
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:28.720]  It's completely true.
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:30.720]  Let me say it for the 900th time.
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:34.720]  Any claim, assertion or implication that I knew about
[2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:38.720]  or was involved in or condoned the illegal acts in January 6th
[2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:41.720]  or any other day is categorically false.
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:43.720]  And I know, because I know you,
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:46.720]  that you had nothing to do with this and that you condemned it.
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:50.720]  Well, Roger, but I mean, any more on, which makes me mad
[2:39:50.720 --> 2:39:52.720]  at some of the groups that did get involved in this,
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:54.720]  larping to get attention to what happened.
[2:39:54.720 --> 2:39:57.720]  The worst thing that could happen was attack the Capitol.
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:39:58.720]  Why the hell would we do that?
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:01.720]  We wanted a 10 day investigation on the Constitution.
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:05.720]  Like why would I pour gasoline on myself and light myself on fire?
[2:40:05.720 --> 2:40:07.720]  Like you robbed the bank to get the money or you whatever.
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:09.720]  Like we, we're not idiots.
[2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:12.720]  We don't have a motive to attack the Capitol.
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:14.720]  That's the first part.
[2:40:14.720 --> 2:40:18.720]  You see, to accuse us of that is to accuse us of stupidity.
[2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:20.720]  We're a lot of things, but we're not stupid.
[2:40:20.720 --> 2:40:23.720]  I've seen the video of you jump up with a bullhorn and tell people,
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:25.720]  no, pull back.
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:27.720]  This is a peaceful demonstration.
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:31.720]  So this whole leftist idea that A knows B, who knows C,
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:34.720]  and that proves that proves nothing whatsoever.
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:35.720]  Well, let's expand on that.
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:37.720]  Yeah, it's like my neighbor kills, kills his wife.
[2:40:37.720 --> 2:40:40.720]  Just as I know his, just as I know the neighbor to me,
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:41.720]  I'm a suspect.
[2:40:41.720 --> 2:40:43.720]  How do you think this ends?
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:45.720]  You said this morning, this is desperation.
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:46.720]  No, this is desperation.
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:49.720]  Well, you know, I mean, this is crazy.
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:53.720]  They have no, they have no issues going into the next election.
[2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:58.720]  I would not be shocked to see them try to suspend or postpone the elections
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:01.720]  for some fraudulent national security reasons.
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:03.720]  Power outage.
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:04.720]  Whatever.
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:08.720]  They know that they are going to lose if we can even get an honest count,
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:10.720]  which is a legitimate question.
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:14.720]  And I still believe that the answer is not taking Republican control of both houses.
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:16.720]  That's not going to change anything.
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:21.720]  With the election of a subset of patriots, a subset of real solid men and women
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:24.720]  who are America first constitutionalists in both houses,
[2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:28.720]  a group of 20 in the house, I believe, a group of four in the Senate
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:30.720]  can change the course of history.
[2:41:30.720 --> 2:41:31.720]  Exactly.
[2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.720]  That caucus, that house caucus in the House of the Senate
[2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:40.720]  could then on policies like Ron Paul used to do, only vote on issues.
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:42.720]  But now we have 100 Ron Pauls.
[2:41:42.720 --> 2:41:43.720]  We can do it.
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:46.720]  Let me tell you the difference between a caucus and a cactus.
[2:41:46.720 --> 2:41:48.720]  You know the difference, Alex?
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:51.720]  In a cactus, all the pricks are on the outside.
[2:41:51.720 --> 2:41:55.720]  So what would you call this group, just patriots?
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:57.720]  I think it's an America first group.
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:41:59.720]  You send Laura Loomer to Congress.
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:01.720]  You send Mike Crispy to Congress.
[2:42:01.720 --> 2:42:03.720]  You send JR Majewski to Congress.
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:06.720]  They're not taking orders from Kevin McCarthy.
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:09.720]  You send Jackson Lawmire to the Senate.
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:13.720]  You send Alex Gray to the Senate.
[2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:15.720]  You're going to see a real change.
[2:42:15.720 --> 2:42:17.720]  And that's why they're so scared of MTG,
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:20.720]  if she's the example of a maverick won't take orders.
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:22.720]  That's absolutely true.
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:24.720]  Alex, great to be back with you.
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:25.720]  God bless you.
[2:42:25.720 --> 2:42:27.720]  Folks, grab an Info Wars product.
[2:42:27.720 --> 2:42:30.720]  And while you're at it, go to StoneColdTruth.com
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:32.720]  and keep up with what the Stones are doing.
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:34.720]  And let's talk about Officer Greco real quick.
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:35.720]  People can support him.
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:36.720]  How do they do that?
[2:42:36.720 --> 2:42:41.720]  They go to HelpThisNYCOP.com.
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:44.720]  He's going to have to mount a lawsuit against NYPD.
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:47.720]  We're going to put Mayor Adams on the stand and roast him.
[2:42:47.720 --> 2:42:49.720]  Please go to HelpThisNYCOP.com.
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:50.720]  God bless you.
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:51.720]  All right, Roger.
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:52.720]  Thank you.
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:42:53.720]  Go say respects to your parents.
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:54.720]  We appreciate you.
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:43:06.720]  We appreciate you.
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:32.720]  We appreciate you.
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:57.720]  We appreciate you.
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:43:58.720]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:43:58.720 --> 2:44:00.720]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:02.720]  Welcome.
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:03.720]  Hello, Alex.
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:04.720]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:05.720]  All right.
[2:44:05.720 --> 2:44:07.720]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons
[2:44:07.720 --> 2:44:08.720]  can get on the line.
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:11.720]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts,
[2:44:11.720 --> 2:44:12.720]  Owen Schreuer.
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:15.720]  Supermail Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:16.720]  Mix those two together.
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:18.720]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:20.720]  Supermail Vitality really, really works.
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:24.720]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never
[2:44:24.720 --> 2:44:25.720]  been heated up.
[2:44:25.720 --> 2:44:29.720]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:32.720]  It's like a very fine wine.
[2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:34.720]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:35.720]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[2:44:35.720 --> 2:44:36.720]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:38.720]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting
[2:44:38.720 --> 2:44:40.720]  sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:41.720]  That's just how it is.
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:42.720]  It's how it works.
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:44.720]  So it's always good.
[2:44:44.720 --> 2:44:46.720]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:44:46.720 --> 2:44:49.720]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:56.720]  then this is it.
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:59.720]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were
[2:44:59.720 --> 2:45:01.720]  adopted in 1791.
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:04.720]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free
[2:45:04.720 --> 2:45:06.720]  speech and free press.
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:10.720]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions
[2:45:10.720 --> 2:45:15.720]  without censorship, interference, and restraint by the government.
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:20.720]  231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:22.720]  and insidious attack.
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:24.720]  GCN is under attack.
[2:45:24.720 --> 2:45:27.720]  Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not
[2:45:27.720 --> 2:45:29.720]  want you to know the truth.
[2:45:29.720 --> 2:45:33.720]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up
[2:45:33.720 --> 2:45:37.720]  and help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth.
[2:45:37.720 --> 2:45:39.720]  Would you like to join us?
[2:45:39.720 --> 2:45:44.720]  If so, please consider visiting savegcn.com.
[2:45:44.720 --> 2:45:47.720]  Savegcn.com.
[2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:51.720]  You may click follow, share, give, and pray.
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:54.720]  You may select all of those choices.
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:57.720]  I'm Vincent Finnelli.
[2:45:57.720 --> 2:46:02.720]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing,
[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:09.720]  the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public is in,
[2:46:09.720 --> 2:46:13.720]  the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:17.720]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare
[2:46:17.720 --> 2:46:21.720]  or you're in a horror if you get knocked out and you've lost
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:27.720]  your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:30.720]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:32.720]  They have stunned us.
[2:46:32.720 --> 2:46:35.720]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings
[2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:37.720]  and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:41.720]  called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public is lost,
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:44.720]  how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure
[2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:47.720]  the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity
[2:46:47.720 --> 2:46:49.720]  over the edge of a cliff.
[2:46:49.720 --> 2:46:51.720]  That's what the Great Recent is.
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:53.720]  They need darkness to thrive.
[2:46:53.720 --> 2:47:15.720]  Get in at FullWars.com.
[2:47:24.720 --> 2:47:28.720]  No one dared to ask his business.
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:30.720]  No one dared to make a slip.
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:34.720]  The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip.
[2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:39.720]  Big iron on his hip.
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:45.720]  It was early in the morning when he rode into the town.
[2:47:45.720 --> 2:47:51.720]  He came riding from the south side slowly looking all around.
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.720]  He's an outlaw loosened, running, came the whisper from each lip
[2:47:56.720 --> 2:48:00.720]  and he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:03.720]  Big iron on his hip.
[2:48:03.720 --> 2:48:04.720]  He's dick-tainers.
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:05.720]  Yo, come on.
[2:48:05.720 --> 2:48:11.720]  In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red.
[2:48:11.720 --> 2:48:16.720]  Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead.
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:18.720]  Here we are, my friends.
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:21.720]  Let's go ahead and take your phone calls right now.
[2:48:21.720 --> 2:48:23.720]  The order they've been received.
[2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:26.720]  Johnny, Johnny in California, you're on the air.
[2:48:26.720 --> 2:48:27.720]  Thanks for holding.
[2:48:27.720 --> 2:48:29.720]  Alex, yes sir.
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:32.720]  I wanted to let you know what I think the power structure is of the planet
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:33.720]  in my belief.
[2:48:33.720 --> 2:48:37.720]  I want to say that at the top of it, I think of it as in terms of a triangle
[2:48:37.720 --> 2:48:40.720]  and a pyramid and at the top you're going to have the central banks
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:43.720]  and that power is going to come down to the United Nations
[2:48:43.720 --> 2:48:47.720]  and that power is going to come down into the massive corporations of the planet.
[2:48:47.720 --> 2:48:48.720]  You name them.
[2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:49.720]  We have them.
[2:48:49.720 --> 2:48:55.720]  And after that, after the corporation, it's the bureaus,
[2:48:55.720 --> 2:48:58.720]  which is the anything, any type of bureau.
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:04.720]  And after that, it's going to be the institutions,
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:07.720]  which are all your colleges and all your universities.
[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:08.720]  100%.
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:09.720]  That's the new order model.
[2:49:09.720 --> 2:49:10.720]  Take everything.
[2:49:10.720 --> 2:49:11.720]  Damn right.
[2:49:11.720 --> 2:49:12.720]  Yes, sir.
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:14.720]  And then after that, I just wanted to finish the rest of it.
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:17.720]  After that, the institutions, it's going to be the academia,
[2:49:17.720 --> 2:49:20.720]  all our education system.
[2:49:20.720 --> 2:49:24.720]  And then after that, the power structure controls the household
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:27.720]  and then the individual after that.
[2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:29.720]  Yeah, the social credit sphere.
[2:49:29.720 --> 2:49:32.720]  That's how the power structure, in my opinion, is going to come down.
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:35.720]  It's going to come down from the central banks to the UN.
[2:49:35.720 --> 2:49:38.720]  And between that, it's going to be the trilateral commission
[2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:41.720]  and all the think tanks making the decisions for the policy to come through
[2:49:41.720 --> 2:49:42.720]  to the corporation.
[2:49:42.720 --> 2:49:45.720]  So that the corporate policy comes through to the bureaus
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:47.720]  and it gets through to the institutions.
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:50.720]  And the institutions, you know, let everybody know what,
[2:49:50.720 --> 2:49:52.720]  what's going to happen.
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:54.720]  And that's how it all comes down to the household.
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:57.720]  And that's how the individual, in my opinion, is going to be controlled.
[2:49:57.720 --> 2:50:01.720]  And that's the official new world order social credit score plan
[2:50:01.720 --> 2:50:03.720]  being announced with the Debo script.
[2:50:03.720 --> 2:50:04.720]  You're damn right.
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:07.720]  How do we get the average person to understand everything else you do
[2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:11.720]  doesn't matter if you don't stop this and we do it through our states,
[2:50:11.720 --> 2:50:14.720]  our cities, our towns, and the federal government
[2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.720]  that are firewalls against the globalists
[2:50:16.720 --> 2:50:19.720]  and against this corporate dictatorship.
[2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:22.720]  Yes, I would say that we would just want to just control the counties
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:26.720]  and control the sheriffs and make sure that everybody takes control of their state
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:31.720]  and, you know, make sure, because the states are being vacuumed right now
[2:50:31.720 --> 2:50:32.720]  pretty much through legislature.
[2:50:32.720 --> 2:50:33.720]  It's corporate.
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:35.720]  Oh, yeah, they're putting all their people in.
[2:50:35.720 --> 2:50:36.720]  All the major cities.
[2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:37.720]  Great point, Johnny.
[2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:38.720]  Thanks for holding.
[2:50:38.720 --> 2:50:40.720]  All right, let's take another great caller here.
[2:50:40.720 --> 2:50:42.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Florida.
[2:50:42.720 --> 2:50:44.720]  Greg, thanks for calling.
[2:50:44.720 --> 2:50:46.720]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[2:50:46.720 --> 2:50:47.720]  Man, I'm good.
[2:50:47.720 --> 2:50:48.720]  I'm talking to you, brother.
[2:50:48.720 --> 2:50:49.720]  Every day on air is a blessing.
[2:50:49.720 --> 2:50:52.720]  Hey, I tell you what, I'm glad your health is okay.
[2:50:52.720 --> 2:50:53.720]  Yeah, I didn't mean to get it.
[2:50:53.720 --> 2:50:54.720]  I didn't know what it was.
[2:50:54.720 --> 2:50:56.720]  I was dizzy and it had been in return.
[2:50:56.720 --> 2:50:58.720]  It wasn't a sinus infection.
[2:50:58.720 --> 2:50:59.720]  It wasn't my heart.
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:00.720]  I had all these tests.
[2:51:00.720 --> 2:51:01.720]  I finally figured it out.
[2:51:01.720 --> 2:51:02.720]  Yeah.
[2:51:02.720 --> 2:51:03.720]  Good.
[2:51:03.720 --> 2:51:04.720]  Stay, stay high.
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:06.720]  I just never had a vertigo command.
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:07.720]  That sucks.
[2:51:07.720 --> 2:51:09.720]  That's scary stuff.
[2:51:09.720 --> 2:51:11.720]  I didn't want to say on air what it was or like, you know,
[2:51:11.720 --> 2:51:13.720]  because vertigo, you can have vertigo and stuff from heart
[2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:15.720]  problems, but it was an infection.
[2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:17.720]  So I'm better now.
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:18.720]  Good, good.
[2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:19.720]  Hey, a couple of things.
[2:51:19.720 --> 2:51:22.720]  Last time I talked to you real brief, a couple of weeks ago
[2:51:22.720 --> 2:51:28.720]  before you went to LA, you know, you mentioned, I'm the guy that
[2:51:28.720 --> 2:51:31.720]  we started talking about a company I used to own called Laser
[2:51:31.720 --> 2:51:32.720]  Tech.
[2:51:32.720 --> 2:51:33.720]  I remember.
[2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:34.720]  I meant to call you.
[2:51:34.720 --> 2:51:35.720]  Yeah.
[2:51:35.720 --> 2:51:36.720]  Okay.
[2:51:36.720 --> 2:51:40.720]  So let me touch on something real quick that I wanted to mention
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:42.720]  back then because we were talking about these wars, you know,
[2:51:42.720 --> 2:51:45.720]  this thing with these wars, how the wars break out and things
[2:51:45.720 --> 2:51:46.720]  like that.
[2:51:46.720 --> 2:51:50.720]  You know, I have, you know, everything I'm telling you, I
[2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:53.720]  get back up with documentation, et cetera, et cetera.
[2:51:53.720 --> 2:51:56.720]  I have real documents from the official house that you're
[2:51:56.720 --> 2:52:01.720]  familiar with that with their seal on there.
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:06.720]  When George Bush Senior first went into Kuwait over there to do
[2:52:06.720 --> 2:52:09.720]  that little, do that war over there, there was a catastrophe.
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:14.720]  It was just a moneymaker for, for all of his friends.
[2:52:14.720 --> 2:52:15.720]  That was laid out.
[2:52:15.720 --> 2:52:22.720]  I have paperwork, probably two inches thick of how that was
[2:52:22.720 --> 2:52:28.720]  war-gamed all the way down to the, to each and every tank that
[2:52:28.720 --> 2:52:31.720]  was ever over there on the, in the sand.
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:34.720]  That was done four and a half years ago before anyone took
[2:52:34.720 --> 2:52:35.720]  action.
[2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:39.720]  And the other thing, you know, there's a lot of pieces that
[2:52:39.720 --> 2:52:42.720]  you could see out there that put together like when Obama came
[2:52:42.720 --> 2:52:46.720]  in, you know, I was telling you, my company, my chief
[2:52:46.720 --> 2:52:49.720]  scientist, Allen Hill, who developed and directed Star
[2:52:49.720 --> 2:52:54.720]  Wars under the Reagan administration, you know, people
[2:52:54.720 --> 2:52:57.720]  though, really, you know, when Obama was in office, what was
[2:52:57.720 --> 2:52:58.720]  he doing?
[2:52:58.720 --> 2:53:00.720]  One of the main things he was doing that, that I really took
[2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:03.720]  note of was he was the funding Star Wars.
[2:53:03.720 --> 2:53:04.720]  Okay.
[2:53:04.720 --> 2:53:06.720]  So, okay, so you take that into effect.
[2:53:06.720 --> 2:53:09.720]  Now you start adding up pieces and pieces.
[2:53:09.720 --> 2:53:11.720]  Now you're seeing something.
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:13.720]  You're saying it's the takedown on the U.S.
[2:53:13.720 --> 2:53:17.720]  That's why they attacked Trump for Space Force saying, oh,
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:18.720]  what's Space Force?
[2:53:18.720 --> 2:53:20.720]  No, that's our most powerful weapon.
[2:53:20.720 --> 2:53:21.720]  And it's already there.
[2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:23.720]  Trump was giving it a name to refund it.
[2:53:23.720 --> 2:53:24.720]  Exactly.
[2:53:24.720 --> 2:53:26.720]  Everything that, look, everything they're doing is
[2:53:26.720 --> 2:53:27.720]  destroy America.
[2:53:27.720 --> 2:53:30.720]  And this thing on Putin, these sanctions only help Putin.
[2:53:30.720 --> 2:53:33.720]  And let me tell you something, and this stuff now that
[2:53:33.720 --> 2:53:37.720]  they're talking about Alex with fertilizer, you know,
[2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:38.720]  that's a joke.
[2:53:38.720 --> 2:53:42.720]  Okay, yeah, Russia is, I know for a fact Russia is the
[2:53:42.720 --> 2:53:45.720]  world's largest producer of DAP and fertilizer.
[2:53:45.720 --> 2:53:46.720]  Okay.
[2:53:46.720 --> 2:53:52.720]  In 1991, I was bidding against Russia for the country
[2:53:52.720 --> 2:53:53.720]  of India.
[2:53:53.720 --> 2:53:57.720]  They contract, they want to contract for 80,000 metric
[2:53:57.720 --> 2:54:01.720]  tons of DAP, Diamondium Phosphate, which is Eurya.
[2:54:01.720 --> 2:54:04.720]  Every country is different how it's formulated for the
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:05.720]  fertilizer.
[2:54:05.720 --> 2:54:12.720]  And I beat out Russia, not on price, but how I beat them.
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:14.720]  And they even hit a satellite office in Bombay.
[2:54:14.720 --> 2:54:16.720]  You know, we're doing this tomorrow.
[2:54:16.720 --> 2:54:18.720]  I'm doing at least three hours live tomorrow with a bunch
[2:54:18.720 --> 2:54:19.720]  of calls.
[2:54:19.720 --> 2:54:20.720]  I got a special guest.
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:21.720]  I know you are who your company is.
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:22.720]  I know you're for real.
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:24.720]  Last time we didn't do this, but I'm going to get your
[2:54:24.720 --> 2:54:25.720]  name and number now.
[2:54:25.720 --> 2:54:26.720]  We'll give you our email.
[2:54:26.720 --> 2:54:27.720]  Send us talking points.
[2:54:27.720 --> 2:54:29.720]  I want to do at least 30 minutes with you tomorrow.
[2:54:29.720 --> 2:54:31.720]  Greg, I want Greg on the show, guys.
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:34.720]  So I'm going live one to four.
[2:54:34.720 --> 2:54:36.720]  Got a guest at three.
[2:54:36.720 --> 2:54:39.720]  Maybe he should come on like at 2.30 or something.
[2:54:39.720 --> 2:54:43.720]  Or, yeah, so the guest is three to four.
[2:54:43.720 --> 2:54:46.720]  Please come on the show tomorrow for 30 minutes,
[2:54:46.720 --> 2:54:48.720]  brother, so you can lay all this out.
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:49.720]  Put Greg on hold.
[2:54:49.720 --> 2:54:50.720]  Don't hang up on him.
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:51.720]  Thanks.
[2:54:51.720 --> 2:54:53.720]  I want to hear this.
[2:54:53.720 --> 2:54:55.720]  People need to hear the history of this.
[2:54:55.720 --> 2:54:56.720]  This is important.
[2:54:56.720 --> 2:54:57.720]  So we'll get him on the show tomorrow.
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:54:59.720]  Don't hang up on Greg, please.
[2:54:59.720 --> 2:55:00.720]  Okay.
[2:55:00.720 --> 2:55:02.720]  Who's up next here holding the longest?
[2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:07.720]  That would be bone crusher in FEMA region 10.
[2:55:07.720 --> 2:55:10.720]  Go ahead, bone crusher.
[2:55:10.720 --> 2:55:14.720]  Well, Alex, for anybody keeping score out there,
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:17.720]  let's chalk up another one for you because you said that
[2:55:17.720 --> 2:55:19.720]  there would be starvation.
[2:55:19.720 --> 2:55:21.720]  And food shortages.
[2:55:21.720 --> 2:55:23.720]  And they haven't said starvation yet,
[2:55:23.720 --> 2:55:25.720]  but they've had a broken clock,
[2:55:25.720 --> 2:55:28.720]  but not because they said that's their plan.
[2:55:28.720 --> 2:55:29.720]  Yeah.
[2:55:29.720 --> 2:55:31.720]  Yeah, there are going to be food shortages now.
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:33.720]  Not a broken clock, a broken record.
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:34.720]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:55:34.720 --> 2:55:36.720]  Yeah, you said this about the war and everything too.
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:40.720]  So I don't know why people even watch mainstream media anymore.
[2:55:40.720 --> 2:55:43.720]  All they do is cover stuff that's going on right now,
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:46.720]  and they don't even make cover it through a false lens anyway.
[2:55:46.720 --> 2:55:48.720]  So I don't know why people didn't listen to them anymore.
[2:55:48.720 --> 2:55:50.720]  It's just scary to know the truth, brother.
[2:55:50.720 --> 2:55:52.720]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:53.720]  What do you think is coming next?
[2:55:53.720 --> 2:55:55.720]  How do we stop this?
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:55:59.720]  Well, we need to get people in there that are going to start fighting for us.
[2:55:59.720 --> 2:56:02.720]  I think Trump was great, but Trump was like an all offense guy.
[2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:04.720]  You got to have somebody in there.
[2:56:04.720 --> 2:56:06.720]  You got to have people that are going to help with the defense.
[2:56:06.720 --> 2:56:08.720]  You just went and interviewed Mike Tyson.
[2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:11.720]  Everybody thinks of him as an offensive juggernaut, which he was.
[2:56:11.720 --> 2:56:13.720]  But the reason Mike Tyson was great and a champion,
[2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:17.720]  Mike Tyson had some of the best defense that a heavyweight has ever had.
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:19.720]  That's why he was great.
[2:56:19.720 --> 2:56:23.720]  And the defense for Trump and all these people is people like you and Roger,
[2:56:23.720 --> 2:56:26.720]  but they're taking you guys out and they're trying to censor you guys,
[2:56:26.720 --> 2:56:27.720]  and they're trying to do all that.
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:30.720]  So we got to get people in there that are going to fight for us,
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:34.720]  not Mitch the bitch, McConnell and Lindsey Graham and these other people
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:36.720]  that just say something every now and then so that they can still act
[2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:39.720]  like they're a Republican and aren't really a Republican.
[2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:47.720]  Like you said, you got to get MTG and these people that are really going to fight for it.
[2:56:47.720 --> 2:56:49.720]  Now you're right, brother. You're absolutely right.
[2:56:49.720 --> 2:56:52.720]  What else is on your mind?
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:56.720]  I just everything that's going on right now.
[2:56:56.720 --> 2:57:00.720]  I think Roger was right earlier when he said that what Trump is doing right now,
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:02.720]  that it's a complete PR move and it is.
[2:57:02.720 --> 2:57:04.720]  It's not a good legal move. You're wasting your time.
[2:57:04.720 --> 2:57:08.720]  We can't even get courts or juries now that are going to help us.
[2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:12.720]  Like if you look at what even if you get a judge that you think is going to help you,
[2:57:12.720 --> 2:57:14.720]  they're just going to do something crazy.
[2:57:14.720 --> 2:57:17.720]  Like you remember the Epstein case where that I can't remember what her name was or anything,
[2:57:17.720 --> 2:57:21.720]  but she was a female judge on an Epstein case and her whole family got killed.
[2:57:21.720 --> 2:57:23.720]  They like sent hit man to her house.
[2:57:23.720 --> 2:57:25.720]  That's right. No, that's what they do. It's all exactly.
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:28.720]  They're not just bribing these people. They're threatening to kill them.
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:31.720]  And that's why we're in so much trouble. Thank you so much.
[2:57:31.720 --> 2:57:33.720]  I appreciate you. Amazing points.
[2:57:33.720 --> 2:57:39.720]  All right. Up next, Ian, Larry, Wayne and Ben.
[2:57:39.720 --> 2:57:42.720]  In the next two segments then.
[2:57:42.720 --> 2:58:04.720]  Get our takes over.
[2:58:12.720 --> 2:58:20.720]  We're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[2:58:20.720 --> 2:58:24.720]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[2:58:24.720 --> 2:58:30.720]  Info wars and Bandai video have become a mother ship promoting the pro human liberty movement worldwide.
[2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:37.720]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:43.720]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now. The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off.
[2:58:43.720 --> 2:58:47.720]  Get incredible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[2:58:47.720 --> 2:58:58.720]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep France,
[2:58:58.720 --> 2:59:05.720]  but the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[2:59:05.720 --> 2:59:09.720]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare.
[2:59:09.720 --> 2:59:10.720]  You're in a car.
[2:59:10.720 --> 2:59:18.720]  I can get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[2:59:18.720 --> 2:59:21.720]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:23.720]  They have stunned us.
[2:59:23.720 --> 2:59:26.720]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:28.720]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave speech.
[2:59:28.720 --> 2:59:32.720]  He called the great new narrative where he brags of the public is lost.
[2:59:32.720 --> 2:59:37.720]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone.
[2:59:37.720 --> 2:59:40.720]  So they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[2:59:40.720 --> 2:59:42.720]  That's what the great reset is.
[2:59:42.720 --> 2:59:43.720]  They need darkness to thrive.
[2:59:43.720 --> 3:00:09.720]  The White Lives at nfowars.com.
[3:00:09.720 --> 3:00:14.720]  They have been told that Nazis wave the American flag and vote Republican.
[3:00:14.720 --> 3:00:18.720]  And the brainwashed flock always believe what they are told.
[3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:21.720]  But those of us still cleaving to our sanity.
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:28.720]  Remember that Nazis were members of Hitler's National Socialist Party from the 1930s and 40s.
[3:00:28.720 --> 3:00:32.720]  And not only were there thousands of these in Western Ukraine back then.
[3:00:32.720 --> 3:00:35.720]  It is still a big part of their national pride.
[3:00:35.720 --> 3:00:40.720]  Nazi war criminal Stepan Bandera is a national hero.
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:45.720]  And there are actual Nazi organizations still thriving in Ukraine.
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:51.720]  Including the Azov Regiment, which is now a part of Ukraine's armed forces.
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:56.720]  The notification of Ukraine is well documented and easily verified.
[3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:00.720]  As is the notification of America.
[3:01:00.720 --> 3:01:06.720]  During the 1930s, there were many notable Americans who supported the Nazis.
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:11.720]  Such as Prescott Bush, Henry Ford and Fred Koch.
[3:01:11.720 --> 3:01:15.720]  Banks such as JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan.
[3:01:15.720 --> 3:01:21.720]  Companies such as General Motors, Standard Oil, Shell and IBM.
[3:01:21.720 --> 3:01:27.720]  Major General Smedley Butler of the US Marines was asked by these powerful entities
[3:01:27.720 --> 3:01:31.720]  to help them install National Socialism in the United States.
[3:01:31.720 --> 3:01:38.720]  Appeared before the Congressional Committee, the highest representation of the American people under its subpoena
[3:01:38.720 --> 3:01:44.720]  to tell what I knew of activities, which I believe might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:51.720]  I was supposed to lead an organization of 500,000 men, which would be able to take over the functions of government.
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:59.720]  And when that plan failed, war broke out in Europe with the support of the banks and these American corporate entities.
[3:01:59.720 --> 3:02:05.720]  After World War II, only about a dozen were brought to justice at the Nuremberg trials.
[3:02:05.720 --> 3:02:11.720]  The Catholic Church and the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis evade capture via the rat lines,
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:17.720]  which brought them mostly to South America, where they built an entire town in Argentina.
[3:02:17.720 --> 3:02:24.720]  In Operation Paperclip, the United States secretly absorbed thousands of Nazis into the US government,
[3:02:24.720 --> 3:02:33.720]  where they led the NASA space program and helped pioneer the military-industrial complex as well as Big Pharma.
[3:02:33.720 --> 3:02:38.720]  Many believe that being a Nazi is synonymous with being anti-Jewish,
[3:02:38.720 --> 3:02:42.720]  which may have been true in 1930s Germany, but it's complicated.
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:48.720]  Many high-ranking Nazis themselves, including Adolf Hitler, were Ashkenazi Jews,
[3:02:48.720 --> 3:02:59.720]  who can be traced back to the notorious Khazars, who mysteriously mass converted to Judaism about 1300 years ago in the region now known as Ukraine.
[3:02:59.720 --> 3:03:03.720]  Ashkenazi Jews ran the political Zionist movement in Germany,
[3:03:03.720 --> 3:03:11.720]  and for several years, the Zionists were the only political party allowed to operate inside Germany by the Nazis.
[3:03:11.720 --> 3:03:16.720]  Both the Zionists and the Nazis wanted their own ethnically pure state,
[3:03:16.720 --> 3:03:27.720]  and for years before their final solution, the Nazis helped the Zionists in their efforts to establish the state of Israel within Palestine.
[3:03:27.720 --> 3:03:31.720]  It was far more complicated than mere racial hatred.
[3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:38.720]  Nazism can best be described as fascism, and fascism is godlessness.
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:45.720]  The word Nazi is a made-up slur, but the word fascist can be clearly defined.
[3:03:45.720 --> 3:03:53.720]  It stems from the Latin word foskis, which is a bundle of sticks banded together to form a deadly weapon,
[3:03:53.720 --> 3:04:00.720]  an old-school meme that represents the deadly power of an organized mob, a gang.
[3:04:00.720 --> 3:04:07.720]  When men lack a personal relationship with God, they inevitably band together out of fear,
[3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:14.720]  submitting to the strongman for a small taste of dominance, they become just another beast in the jungle.
[3:04:14.720 --> 3:04:20.720]  And today, we can clearly see this fascist mentality in all of these godless groups.
[3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:32.720]  The woke, the Satanists, the transhumanists, and the genocidal mass murderers of the Great Reset are all merging together into one giant foskis.
[3:04:32.720 --> 3:04:40.720]  Godless men and women banded together out of fear, fascists serving the strongman.
[3:04:40.720 --> 3:04:49.720]  Spiritually speaking, these are the weakest among us, and so far, we are allowing them to destroy everything.
[3:04:49.720 --> 3:04:53.720]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[3:04:53.720 --> 3:05:07.720]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[3:05:07.720 --> 3:05:16.720]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[3:05:16.720 --> 3:05:25.720]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart
[3:05:25.720 --> 3:05:34.720]  because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover, and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[3:05:34.720 --> 3:05:39.720]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[3:05:39.720 --> 3:05:48.720]  In Canada, they have now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:56.720]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation, and stay tuned into Infowars.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[3:05:56.720 --> 3:06:05.720]  Hi folks, we're back live here in 8 hours about to take over.
[3:06:05.720 --> 3:06:21.720]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:06:21.720 --> 3:06:30.720]  We're going to talk to Larry, Wayne, Ian, Ben, and then we're going to hand the baton to Jay Dyer who's ready to go.
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:33.720]  With the deep intel the globalists don't want you to know.
[3:06:33.720 --> 3:06:40.720]  Going in the order the calls received, Ian and Virginia on the hidden or the occult, welcome.
[3:06:40.720 --> 3:06:46.720]  Hi Alex, I wish you good health and all the best with your ordeals.
[3:06:46.720 --> 3:06:49.720]  Thank you brother, I appreciate you.
[3:06:49.720 --> 3:06:53.720]  Well, I had a couple of points if I have time.
[3:06:53.720 --> 3:07:01.720]  One of the main points is you have said in the past that they show you what they're going to do before they do it.
[3:07:01.720 --> 3:07:16.720]  The main purpose of that is to make you complicit in the evil that they're perpetrating because your tolerance to evil becomes acceptance of evil and it becomes the acquiescence to evil.
[3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:24.720]  So you have to be a willing participant in their crimes and in their sin and by telling you that that's what they're doing.
[3:07:24.720 --> 3:07:33.720]  Whether it's conscious, fully conscious to you or not by participating, you are participating in their evil.
[3:07:33.720 --> 3:07:51.720]  The other point that I wanted to try to make was that I think the best thing that people can do is understand that their organization and their concentration of energy is their best tool in defeating this
[3:07:51.720 --> 3:08:00.720]  because the last or the left hand path or whatever you choose to call them, their best weapon is their organization.
[3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:06.720]  That's how they have the judges packed and the institutions packed so that they can work against us.
[3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:10.720]  Oh yeah, they're a unified cult, they admit that's their power.
[3:08:10.720 --> 3:08:16.720]  Absolutely, that's our power and we have to start realizing that's our power too.
[3:08:16.720 --> 3:08:24.720]  That's why they're so scared about us organizing it in together because they know we have right on our side, they know we're good and they can't stand it.
[3:08:24.720 --> 3:08:40.720]  Absolutely, and I think I know this is difficult as a radio host to do, but if people could take 30 seconds of their time to concentrate and prayer, that would help everybody.
[3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:53.720]  If people would pray for God to show them their own way in life, how they need to make changes in their own life to serve God and do his will on this earth, that would be our best weapon and to do it together.
[3:08:53.720 --> 3:08:59.720]  No, you're right, because God is a free will God and we have to invite the co-pilot in.
[3:08:59.720 --> 3:09:02.720]  It's not like the devil that forces it on you.
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:05.720]  God's not trying to rape you like he's left his pedophiles.
[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:10.720]  God is trying to get you to choose the right path and to join with God through free will.
[3:09:10.720 --> 3:09:15.720]  You're absolutely right, you've got to invite God in as the co-pilot and you've got to accept those directives.
[3:09:15.720 --> 3:09:17.720]  God won't give you things that are too big.
[3:09:17.720 --> 3:09:19.720]  God wants to build you up and make you strong.
[3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:23.720]  Yes, sir, and may I say one more thing?
[3:09:23.720 --> 3:09:25.720]  Yeah, I've got to get the other callers, but go ahead.
[3:09:25.720 --> 3:09:31.720]  In Psalm 82-6, it says, He are God's and the sons of God.
[3:09:31.720 --> 3:09:35.720]  And Christ also reiterates this in John 10.34.
[3:09:35.720 --> 3:09:37.720]  I hear your brother and I appreciate your call.
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:39.720]  I'm committed to get to everybody.
[3:09:39.720 --> 3:09:42.720]  Okay, let's go to Larry in Florida.
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:44.720]  Go ahead.
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:46.720]  Hey, Alex.
[3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:47.720]  Welcome.
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:52.720]  Thank you very much for my call and like a bunch of like the previous callers.
[3:09:52.720 --> 3:09:57.720]  Everybody is just really happy to hear that there was nothing serious with your health.
[3:09:57.720 --> 3:09:59.720]  Thank you, brother.
[3:09:59.720 --> 3:10:01.720]  I was just a sign of affection, but I was dizzy.
[3:10:01.720 --> 3:10:03.720]  So everybody thought, well, he's a big guy.
[3:10:03.720 --> 3:10:05.720]  He must be having a hard problem.
[3:10:05.720 --> 3:10:07.720]  Well, we need you in that pilot seat.
[3:10:07.720 --> 3:10:08.720]  A couple of comments.
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:11.720]  I'm going to try and be real quick and then one suggestion.
[3:10:11.720 --> 3:10:14.720]  Commenting on the conversation with Roger.
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:19.720]  There's a theory there or theme, you know, America first candidates.
[3:10:19.720 --> 3:10:21.720]  That's what we need to elect.
[3:10:21.720 --> 3:10:27.720]  And Roger's right on, not just any Republican and one other candidate.
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:32.720]  And in fact, Roger's actually helping on his campaign is Martin Hyde,
[3:10:32.720 --> 3:10:38.720]  who is running in Florida against Verne Buchanan District 16, trying to primary.
[3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:43.720]  And so tough race, but he's got the right philosophy and the right approach.
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:46.720]  So just a quick observation on that.
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:51.720]  Two informational things I have read and if you, you know, if you already know it,
[3:10:51.720 --> 3:10:57.720]  but court, there's been court rulings now in France that insurance companies
[3:10:57.720 --> 3:11:03.720]  don't have to pay death benefits on folks that have taken the jab.
[3:11:03.720 --> 3:11:09.720]  Surprise because in most policies, you know, exclusions for suicide.
[3:11:09.720 --> 3:11:14.720]  And apparently in a lot of policies, you have exclusions for experimental
[3:11:14.720 --> 3:11:17.720]  medications or medical treatments.
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:23.720]  So just a heads up and the national insurance organization here in the country
[3:11:23.720 --> 3:11:25.720]  is looking at that too.
[3:11:25.720 --> 3:11:33.720]  And their claims for 2020 were up 15% for for paying death benefits, 15% over.
[3:11:33.720 --> 3:11:37.720]  We got a major depopulation operation going on.
[3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:39.720]  You can't deny I could talk to you for hours.
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:40.720]  Larry, thank you.
[3:11:40.720 --> 3:11:42.720]  Got to cram in everybody before this segment ends.
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:44.720]  Wayne, we'll get to you next.
[3:11:44.720 --> 3:11:46.720]  But first is Ben in Pennsylvania.
[3:11:46.720 --> 3:11:48.720]  Ben, welcome.
[3:11:48.720 --> 3:11:52.720]  Alex, you're definitely my brother from another mother.
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:11:53.720]  Love you, brother.
[3:11:53.720 --> 3:11:54.720]  What's on your mind?
[3:11:54.720 --> 3:11:56.720]  I want to thank you for everything you do.
[3:11:56.720 --> 3:11:59.720]  I definitely want to give a shout out to InfoWare Store.
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:04.720]  If you're not wearing an arrest fountain t-shirt or an arrest Bill Gates,
[3:12:04.720 --> 3:12:07.720]  sticker on the back of your vehicle, you're missing out on fun,
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:11.720]  lasting conversations with tons and tons of people.
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:15.720]  I just want to tell you, I've been awake for a long time.
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:21.720]  One of my good friends, Cobra helicopter pilot from Johnstown.
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:25.720]  If you want to GPS it, you can see the Cobra helicopters.
[3:12:25.720 --> 3:12:28.720]  Shut down flight 93.
[3:12:28.720 --> 3:12:30.720]  I've been awake for over 20 years.
[3:12:30.720 --> 3:12:32.720]  I'm so happy I found you.
[3:12:32.720 --> 3:12:35.720]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:38.720]  The one thing that I want to ask you, if you've ever heard about,
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:42.720]  we had a private geriatric prison.
[3:12:42.720 --> 3:12:46.720]  I live in a very, very small town in Pennsylvania.
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:51.720]  And this prison only was in a town of 3,000 people,
[3:12:51.720 --> 3:12:53.720]  yet it housed 1,850 people.
[3:12:53.720 --> 3:12:56.720]  The second COVID came in.
[3:12:56.720 --> 3:12:59.720]  During the Trump administration, they shut it down.
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:02.720]  Totally flew out all the planes, everything.
[3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:07.720]  Last summer, we started seeing C-130 planes fly into our local small airport.
[3:13:07.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  And there's now 1,850 Afghan refugees living in a 3,000 person town.
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:21.720]  I've seen that report. It's crazy, isn't it, brother?
[3:13:21.720 --> 3:13:27.720]  And the other thing is I hired a guy last year who was in the National Guard.
[3:13:27.720 --> 3:13:32.720]  And I asked him about his two-week stint during the summer.
[3:13:32.720 --> 3:13:34.720]  And I said, well, what do you do for the two weeks?
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:38.720]  And he's like, well, for me, it's been four weeks the last two years.
[3:13:38.720 --> 3:13:41.720]  I go to Northern Macedonia and train UN troops.
[3:13:41.720 --> 3:13:43.720]  And I'm like, what?
[3:13:43.720 --> 3:13:45.720]  And he's like, yeah. And I said, with our stuff?
[3:13:45.720 --> 3:13:48.720]  He's like, yeah.
[3:13:48.720 --> 3:13:50.720]  Never heard of that. National Guard.
[3:13:50.720 --> 3:13:52.720]  Brother, the globalists are busy beavers.
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:54.720]  Thanks for your intel. Thank you, Ben.
[3:13:54.720 --> 3:13:57.720]  Last caller before Jadar takes over.
[3:13:57.720 --> 3:13:59.720]  Wayne in Texas. Go ahead.
[3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:01.720]  Hello, Alex. How are you, sir?
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:03.720]  I'm great. Doing a live show tomorrow.
[3:14:03.720 --> 3:14:05.720]  I promise 1 p.m. Central.
[3:14:05.720 --> 3:14:09.720]  That sounds good. Hey, I wanted to offer some comic relief.
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:12.720]  I know that you share a similar, you know,
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:16.720]  disturbing sentiment for something about Brian Stilter, you know,
[3:14:16.720 --> 3:14:19.720]  and what you might cast him for if you were going to do it for a movie.
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:22.720]  Now, with that being said, I don't believe in coincidences.
[3:14:22.720 --> 3:14:26.720]  To describe this quickly, my friend used to teach a, you know,
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:29.720]  kids that had disabilities to defend themselves.
[3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:31.720]  And he'd drawn a face on a dummy once.
[3:14:31.720 --> 3:14:33.720]  Well, years later, the dummy,
[3:14:33.720 --> 3:14:36.720]  the face on the dummy drew look like Jerry Sandusky.
[3:14:36.720 --> 3:14:38.720]  Well, I was thinking about Brian Stilter.
[3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:40.720]  Someone was always off about him.
[3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:42.720]  And I realized what it was the other day.
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:44.720]  And I've discovered his doppelganger.
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:49.720]  It's Jared Fogle, the guy from Subway that solicited a minor.
[3:14:49.720 --> 3:14:55.720]  If you Google his image, I kid you not, they could be the same person.
[3:14:55.720 --> 3:14:58.720]  Same smile, everything. It's disturbing.
[3:14:58.720 --> 3:15:00.720]  Crazy, brother. What else is on your mind?
[3:15:00.720 --> 3:15:03.720]  No, that's it. I just wanted to share that.
[3:15:03.720 --> 3:15:06.720]  You just can't make this stuff up.
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:08.720]  Unbelievable. Thank you, sir.
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:10.720]  And God bless you.
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:16.720]  We've got Jay Dyer and his special guests that are about to take over.
[3:15:16.720 --> 3:15:22.720]  Let's put them on screen a lot better to look at there than Humpty Dumpty.
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:24.720]  Also known as Brian Stilter.
[3:15:24.720 --> 3:15:28.720]  So Jay Dyer is about to take over and he is with Jay's analysis.
[3:15:28.720 --> 3:15:30.720]  He's the best-selling author and more.
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:32.720]  He's got a lot to cover.
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:34.720]  I always love listening on Fridays when he's here.
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:35.720]  So Jay Dyer takes over.
[3:15:35.720 --> 3:15:42.720]  And then in T-minus 45 minutes, the great Owen Troyer with the War Room.
[3:15:42.720 --> 3:15:44.720]  That is 3 to 6 p.m. Central.
[3:15:44.720 --> 3:15:48.720]  And tomorrow, I'm going to be here for this when I miss the other days I was sick.
[3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:51.720]  1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
[3:15:51.720 --> 3:16:17.720]  3-hour live show with special guests.
[3:16:17.720 --> 3:16:24.720]  And that's why it's more important than ever that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know about the show

[3:16:32.720 --> 3:16:35.720]  And one of the number one things to do is high-quality, storeable food.

[3:20:19.720 --> 3:20:23.720]  Get some of that coral calcium that you can get in the info war store.
[3:20:23.720 --> 3:20:26.720]  I don't know whether to support the info war by getting all of your products there.
[3:20:26.720 --> 3:20:29.720]  I've been using the coral calcium, right?
[3:20:29.720 --> 3:20:31.720]  My beautiful wife has actual whites.
[3:20:31.720 --> 3:20:37.720]  She has the whitest teeth actually in this household that's been proven by peer reviewed study.
[3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:44.720]  Today we're going to be talking about the marriage, the alchemical wedding of pop culture and politics.
[3:20:44.720 --> 3:20:45.720]  You titled this what?
[3:20:45.720 --> 3:20:46.720]  The world is a stage?
[3:20:46.720 --> 3:20:47.720]  The world is a stage.
[3:20:47.720 --> 3:20:50.720]  Yeah, Shakespeare said the world is a stage and we are just players.
[3:20:50.720 --> 3:20:52.720]  And today that's what we're going to talk about.
[3:20:52.720 --> 3:20:56.720]  So last week we were discussing what you might do a show about.
[3:20:56.720 --> 3:20:58.720]  And you said what's going on in the world?
[3:20:58.720 --> 3:20:59.720]  What's everyone talking about?
[3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:03.720]  And I said they're all talking about how Kanye is treating Kim.
[3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:05.720]  And you said, oh, that's just a distraction.
[3:21:05.720 --> 3:21:07.720]  And I said, okay, okay.
[3:21:07.720 --> 3:21:09.720]  What's something serious?
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:13.720]  And I was thinking about Ukraine and Zelinsky.
[3:21:13.720 --> 3:21:17.720]  And my brain went, well, wasn't he just an actor too?
[3:21:17.720 --> 3:21:21.720]  So that gave me an idea for a show.
[3:21:21.720 --> 3:21:26.720]  And to be fair, Kim, I mean, Kanye did run for president in 2020.
[3:21:26.720 --> 3:21:27.720]  Oh, I forgot about that.
[3:21:27.720 --> 3:21:28.720]  Do you remember that?
[3:21:28.720 --> 3:21:29.720]  There's on a Yeezy ticket.
[3:21:29.720 --> 3:21:33.720]  Yes, he got 60,000 votes in the 12 states where he got on the ballot.
[3:21:33.720 --> 3:21:35.720]  So that's not too shabby, right?
[3:21:35.720 --> 3:21:42.720]  And then you got Kim Kardashian went to the Trump White House to talk about criminal justice reform.
[3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:44.720]  So they got their fingers in politics.
[3:21:44.720 --> 3:21:50.720]  But then I went and researched Vladimir Zelinsky and his resume.
[3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:51.720]  So you want to hear about that?
[3:21:51.720 --> 3:21:52.720]  Sure.
[3:21:52.720 --> 3:21:53.720]  Okay.
[3:21:53.720 --> 3:21:56.720]  So this is according to CNN in 2022.
[3:21:56.720 --> 3:22:04.720]  It says his acting career prepared him for the world stage and Hollywood rallies around one of their own because he's an actor.
[3:22:04.720 --> 3:22:09.720]  So before he entered politics, he was a comedian, actor, writer.
[3:22:09.720 --> 3:22:17.720]  And he starred in a series called Servant of the People about a high school teacher who becomes president.
[3:22:17.720 --> 3:22:24.720]  He received recognition from Michael Keaton and others at the Screen Actors Guild Award for fighting the fight.
[3:22:24.720 --> 3:22:26.720]  So he's being honored by Hollywood.
[3:22:26.720 --> 3:22:30.720]  He co-wrote a male version of Sex in the City.
[3:22:30.720 --> 3:22:34.720]  He played Napoleon in a 2012 movie.
[3:22:34.720 --> 3:22:38.720]  He was the voice of Paddington Bear in Ukraine.
[3:22:38.720 --> 3:22:42.720]  He won Ukraine Dancing with the Stars in 2006.
[3:22:42.720 --> 3:22:43.720]  Do you know about that?
[3:22:43.720 --> 3:22:45.720]  So this is clearly a person that we should take serious.
[3:22:45.720 --> 3:22:46.720]  Yes.
[3:22:46.720 --> 3:22:49.720]  This is a serious politician.
[3:22:49.720 --> 3:22:50.720]  Okay.
[3:22:50.720 --> 3:22:58.720]  So Servant of the People will air again alongside the documentary called Zelinsky, The Man Who Took on Putin.
[3:22:58.720 --> 3:23:07.720]  He was in a 2014 music video parody where he was dancing in crop tops and 8-inch stiletto heels.
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:08.720]  I saw that beautiful thing.
[3:23:08.720 --> 3:23:09.720]  Yes.
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:10.720]  Yes.
[3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:14.720]  It was a version of a song by Ukrainian Europop boy band Kazaki.
[3:23:14.720 --> 3:23:17.720]  And it was very beautiful and alluring.
[3:23:17.720 --> 3:23:18.720]  Yeah.
[3:23:18.720 --> 3:23:20.720]  So every time I see that guy, I think Jeremy Renner.
[3:23:20.720 --> 3:23:26.720]  So somebody, I couldn't tell if it was a joke or if they were being serious that Jeremy Renner was going to play another actor who's the president.
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:27.720]  Yeah.
[3:23:27.720 --> 3:23:29.720]  So it's very inception-y, right?
[3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:30.720]  It is.
[3:23:30.720 --> 3:23:33.720]  Even that he played somebody that became the president.
[3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:35.720]  An everyday average Joe who became president.
[3:23:35.720 --> 3:23:39.720]  Well, this is not anything new when it comes to American politics.
[3:23:39.720 --> 3:23:44.720]  I mean, we've had countless people move from Hollywood to politics.
[3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:45.720]  Yes.
[3:23:45.720 --> 3:23:49.720]  And even vice versa, politics to Hollywood back and forth.
[3:23:49.720 --> 3:23:52.720]  I mean, Reagan, obviously, that's a famous case.
[3:23:52.720 --> 3:24:04.720]  I remember reading that Reagan that they actually did a study and they figured out that if he and his wife transitioned from doing movies in Hollywood to politics, they would have a much better effect.
[3:24:04.720 --> 3:24:11.720]  Especially garnering as a husband and wife team, you know, kind of the lion's share of the so-called conservative market out there.
[3:24:11.720 --> 3:24:18.720]  So, you know, he went from being, doing bedtime with Bonzo and monkey movies to being the president.
[3:24:18.720 --> 3:24:29.720]  And then the last thing we have on Zelinsky was John Andrusk of Five for Fighting has released a new single dedicated to Zelinsky called Can One Man Save the World?
[3:24:29.720 --> 3:24:30.720]  Is that a band?
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:31.720]  I don't know what that is.
[3:24:31.720 --> 3:24:32.720]  Five for Fighting, yeah.
[3:24:32.720 --> 3:24:33.720]  It's a band.
[3:24:33.720 --> 3:24:34.720]  It's not like a band.
[3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:35.720]  Yeah.
[3:24:35.720 --> 3:24:37.720]  It's like a band I would never listen to.
[3:24:37.720 --> 3:24:40.720]  You mentioned actors who became politicians and I have a whole list.
[3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:41.720]  Oh, you found some of them.
[3:24:41.720 --> 3:24:43.720]  So, let's go down that really fast.
[3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:46.720]  So, you said Ronald Reagan, who was governor and became president.
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:48.720]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California.
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:50.720]  Jesse Ventura, governor of Minnesota.
[3:24:50.720 --> 3:24:53.720]  Sonny Bono, mayor of Palm Springs and Congress.
[3:24:53.720 --> 3:25:00.720]  Well, you know, when it comes to Jesse Ventura, I was fighting the predator so you know I'm going to do good as the governor.
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:04.720]  Clay Aiken, did you know he was in politics?
[3:25:04.720 --> 3:25:06.720]  Congressional candidate for North Carolina.
[3:25:06.720 --> 3:25:10.720]  Clint Eastwood was mayor of Carmel by the sea, California.
[3:25:10.720 --> 3:25:13.720]  Jerry Springer was on Cincinnati City Council.
[3:25:13.720 --> 3:25:16.720]  Shirley Temple was a congressional candidate and became an ambassador.
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:17.720]  Wow.
[3:25:17.720 --> 3:25:20.720]  George Takai was on the Los Angeles City Council.
[3:25:20.720 --> 3:25:21.720]  Oh my.
[3:25:21.720 --> 3:25:22.720]  There you go.
[3:25:22.720 --> 3:25:25.720]  Cynthia Nixon from Sex and the City ran for mayor of New York City.
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:29.720]  Al Franken became a senator and Caitlyn Jenner was running for governor of California.
[3:25:29.720 --> 3:25:31.720]  And that's just the short list.
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:32.720]  There's a very much longer list.
[3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:34.720]  It's Bruce Gender, you mean?
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:35.720]  Yes.
[3:25:35.720 --> 3:25:43.720]  So this all goes back to the beginning of Hollywood with Louis B. Mayer in the 1920s of MGM.
[3:25:43.720 --> 3:25:50.720]  He actually was the one who brought the Republican Party to Hollywood to use movie stars to enhance the image of politicians.
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:54.720]  MGM became the publicity wing for the GOP.
[3:25:54.720 --> 3:25:58.720]  And this was the beginning of photo ops and glamor for politicians.
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:03.720]  So Mayer was actually a first person from Hollywood to spend the night in the White House.
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:07.720]  And this partnership became what they call cinematic politics.
[3:26:07.720 --> 3:26:26.720]  And then in the 1930s became issue politics and Edward G. Robinson was an outspoken public critic of fascism and Nazism and demonstrated that a mobilized community of stars could use their celebrity to draw national attention to controversial issues of the day and sway public eyes.
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:28.720]  Oh, yeah.
[3:26:28.720 --> 3:26:30.720]  But he's always playing the organized crime figure.
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:31.720]  That's funny.
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:32.720]  Yes.
[3:26:32.720 --> 3:26:33.720]  The mobster guy.
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:35.720]  Yeah, he's always playing the mob guy.
[3:26:35.720 --> 3:26:45.720]  So this became movement politics, which becomes radical changes in pop culture because of the influence of celebrities and their household name.
[3:26:45.720 --> 3:26:55.720]  By the way, I would add to that this was also studied at the sociological level that they could utilize and sell pop figures as social engineering tools.
[3:26:55.720 --> 3:26:58.720]  So they're not just commodities or, you know, entities that make money.
[3:26:58.720 --> 3:27:01.720]  They're also social engineering tools.
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:07.720]  And that's why I think a lot of the pop stars have sort of auditioned themselves for different social causes nowadays.
[3:27:07.720 --> 3:27:09.720]  We see them become the face of a movement.
[3:27:09.720 --> 3:27:12.720]  And that's because really they're just bought off to do that.
[3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:13.720]  Yes.
[3:27:13.720 --> 3:27:22.720]  So you've got Charlton Heston back in the day who uses his Moses persona and the trust that he gets from those kind of roles to influence elections.
[3:27:22.720 --> 3:27:28.720]  Ronald Reagan represented the new kind of politician for a new media and television age.
[3:27:28.720 --> 3:27:34.720]  And Arnold used pop media and movie quotes as slogans to get elected.
[3:27:34.720 --> 3:27:36.720]  So he would go on entertainment tonight.
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:37.720]  That's a great example.
[3:27:37.720 --> 3:27:43.720]  And those kind of shows instead of 60 minutes in the more serious shows because he knew that those kind of shows had more viewers.
[3:27:43.720 --> 3:27:44.720]  It's not a tumor.
[3:27:44.720 --> 3:27:45.720]  So this is.
[3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:46.720]  Is that what got him elected?
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:47.720]  It's not a tumor.
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:52.720]  Yeah. Well, he did. He's like, we're going to blast them and.
[3:27:52.720 --> 3:27:53.720]  Yeah.
[3:27:53.720 --> 3:27:54.720]  Right.
[3:27:54.720 --> 3:27:55.720]  So that was part of his campaign.
[3:27:55.720 --> 3:27:56.720]  Yes.
[3:27:56.720 --> 3:27:57.720]  So movie quotes became political slogans.
[3:27:57.720 --> 3:28:06.720]  And this is where you can turn citizens doing their civic duty into fans who follow and adore no matter what the policies are.
[3:28:06.720 --> 3:28:08.720]  You go watch a movie like Junior.
[3:28:08.720 --> 3:28:09.720]  That one.
[3:28:09.720 --> 3:28:14.720]  That one's actually a really prophetic movie because because Arnold gives birth.
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:19.720]  Well, we're talking about movies like Wag the Dog, American Dreams.
[3:28:19.720 --> 3:28:20.720]  Those are kind of.
[3:28:20.720 --> 3:28:21.720]  Those are political satires.
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:22.720]  Yes.
[3:28:22.720 --> 3:28:25.720]  Political satires that go behind the scenes and show you some truths.
[3:28:25.720 --> 3:28:26.720]  Yeah.
[3:28:26.720 --> 3:28:27.720]  Well, and Wag the Dog.
[3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:33.720]  Keep in mind that was actually consulted on by Milt Brand, Milt Bearden, Chase Brand.
[3:28:33.720 --> 3:28:36.720]  And those were actual CIA guys consulting on the film.
[3:28:36.720 --> 3:28:43.720]  And I think if you pay attention, you can see the Dustin Hoffman is playing that kind of a character director being consulted on by.
[3:28:43.720 --> 3:28:46.720]  The Robert and Eero characters like the CIA sort of operative.
[3:28:46.720 --> 3:28:48.720]  Anyway, don't go anywhere.
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:55.720]  We are covering the marriage between Hollywood and politics on the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:55.720 --> 3:29:00.720]  The Eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[3:29:00.720 --> 3:29:01.720]  They financed major universities.
[3:29:01.720 --> 3:29:07.720]  They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of New York Times.
[3:29:07.720 --> 3:29:13.720]  Other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[3:29:13.720 --> 3:29:22.720]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[3:29:22.720 --> 3:29:27.720]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter.
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:30.720]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well.
[3:29:30.720 --> 3:29:31.720]  I love to make breakfast.
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:40.720]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:46.720]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal biological actions are coming together.
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:53.720]  They really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[3:29:53.720 --> 3:29:56.720]  We cannot let this continue.
[3:29:56.720 --> 3:30:04.720]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[3:30:04.720 --> 3:30:12.720]  If you're having trouble getting to that sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[3:30:12.720 --> 3:30:19.720]  It's our new faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.

[3:30:29.720 --> 3:30:34.720]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[3:30:34.720 --> 3:30:45.720]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:51.720]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.

[3:32:16.720 --> 3:32:21.720]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[3:32:21.720 --> 3:32:27.720]  InfoWars is paradoxical, it is more popular than ever, it is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[3:32:27.720 --> 3:32:35.720]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[3:32:53.720 --> 3:32:56.720]  Thank you for your support.
[3:32:56.720 --> 3:33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:27.720 --> 3:33:48.720]  I'm Alex Jones and I'm the author of this book, Hollywood Mind Control, which you can also get over at jasonalsus.com.
[3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:59.720]  In the shop, sign copies, every copy that you buy that comes from my website is of course autographed and signed by us, East Celebrity Divas here, helping you understand the New World Order.
[3:33:59.720 --> 3:34:09.720]  Now we were talking about the marriage between politics and pop culture and you had covered a few of the famous cases of Hollywood figures that came out of politics.
[3:34:09.720 --> 3:34:12.720]  What's this next point you want to make about Oprah?
[3:34:12.720 --> 3:34:18.720]  Well, this is so pervasive that it actually has a name and it's called the Oprah effect.
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:39.720]  So a study on celebrity endorsements in the 2008 Obama elections concluded that Oprah's endorsement of Obama was responsible for over a million votes and she is the one who got Obama to be the candidate over Hillary in 2008 primary.
[3:34:39.720 --> 3:34:47.720]  So her commercial landscape means that her influence exceeds any that of any other celebrity in history.
[3:34:47.720 --> 3:34:51.720]  So if you want to get elected, Oprah is going to need to be in your pocket.
[3:34:51.720 --> 3:34:55.720]  Think about Oprah. Oprah's a good looking man.
[3:34:55.720 --> 3:35:01.720]  About as good looking as Michael.
[3:35:01.720 --> 3:35:02.720]  That was a joke.
[3:35:02.720 --> 3:35:03.720]  Traveling back a time.
[3:35:03.720 --> 3:35:06.720]  I don't actually think Oprah's a man.
[3:35:06.720 --> 3:35:07.720]  Big Mike.
[3:35:07.720 --> 3:35:13.720]  Do you remember in the 1970s the Elvis and Nixon relationship?
[3:35:13.720 --> 3:35:23.720]  So in 1970 Elvis went to the White House with a letter to the president stating, I have done an in depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing techniques.
[3:35:23.720 --> 3:35:28.720]  And I'm right in the middle of the whole thing where I can and will do the most good.
[3:35:28.720 --> 3:35:37.720]  So Presley, he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and to be named a federal agent at large.
[3:35:37.720 --> 3:35:46.720]  Because he loved badges and police work and detective work and he liked to collect honorary titles of.
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:47.720]  Wow.
[3:35:47.720 --> 3:35:48.720]  Important.
[3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:49.720]  That's wild.
[3:35:49.720 --> 3:35:50.720]  Yeah.
[3:35:50.720 --> 3:35:58.720]  So he claimed to have been studying brainwashing and drug culture for over 10 years and he knew a lot about this and was accepted by the hippies.
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:00.720]  These were his credentials.
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:01.720]  Wow.
[3:36:01.720 --> 3:36:12.720]  He was given an honorary badge, which he treated like the real thing and his wife recalls that he used that badge as some kind of ultimate power to carry guns and drugs into any country he wanted.
[3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:13.720]  Oh, wow.
[3:36:13.720 --> 3:36:19.720]  And we all remember them using Elvis joining the army.
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:20.720]  Right.
[3:36:20.720 --> 3:36:21.720]  Yeah.
[3:36:21.720 --> 3:36:22.720]  Well, his handler was what I got Colonel Tom, right?
[3:36:22.720 --> 3:36:23.720]  Yes.
[3:36:23.720 --> 3:36:24.720]  So he had a handler too.
[3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:30.720]  And another strange thing about Elvis is he never went anywhere without a giant trunk of occult and esoteric books.
[3:36:30.720 --> 3:36:31.720]  Yes.
[3:36:31.720 --> 3:36:32.720]  I didn't know about this.
[3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:34.720]  In fact, he towards the end really got into theosophy.
[3:36:34.720 --> 3:36:44.720]  And so he was like trying to become this esoteric figure who and as I have read, at least he thought towards the end of his life that he was a sort of messianic person, like a new avatar.
[3:36:44.720 --> 3:36:47.720]  And that's very amenable to theosophy.
[3:36:47.720 --> 3:36:50.720]  And so he actually had this people around him that he thought were his 12 disciples.
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:55.720]  And so he had just kind of lost it and gone into messiah complex, basically.
[3:36:55.720 --> 3:36:59.720]  And in my second book, I have a little chapter on Elvis.
[3:36:59.720 --> 3:37:14.720]  Like you said, he became an idol of worship and even some folklore around him that he didn't die, that he's still around and influencing people and blessing them.
[3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:20.720]  So he was one of the first celebrities that was a supernatural idol.
[3:37:20.720 --> 3:37:21.720]  Right?
[3:37:21.720 --> 3:37:22.720]  Yeah.
[3:37:22.720 --> 3:37:25.720]  Well, I mean, it would be beneficial to create these kinds of legends like this, right?
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:28.720]  To help promote the lore and the Arcana of Elvis.
[3:37:28.720 --> 3:37:31.720]  So I can see that being a PR move for sure.
[3:37:31.720 --> 3:37:34.720]  So then we have Katy Perry.
[3:37:34.720 --> 3:37:44.720]  Now, this is a great one because this is really where we start to see the merger between democratic politics and pop culture on a just gigantic scale, right?
[3:37:44.720 --> 3:37:47.720]  I mean, I know there's always been this merger between these different realms.
[3:37:47.720 --> 3:38:01.720]  And even going back to the 1950s, late 40s and early 50s, for example, I didn't know that about MGM, but there was the case of the CIA being involved in the background in the production of the day the Earth stood still.
[3:38:01.720 --> 3:38:13.720]  And so, I think it was Xanaq of 20th Century Fox actually brought in consultants and people like CD Jackson who worked in the Doctrinal Warfare Program to co-op religion.
[3:38:13.720 --> 3:38:20.720]  They brought him in to consult and help craft this movie, which is one of the most famous science fiction movies of all time.
[3:38:20.720 --> 3:38:21.720]  It's total propaganda, right?
[3:38:21.720 --> 3:38:22.720]  It's all scientism.
[3:38:22.720 --> 3:38:26.720]  And Klatu is basically this new scientism version of Jesus.
[3:38:26.720 --> 3:38:28.720]  And he's even called a carpenter and this kind of stuff.
[3:38:28.720 --> 3:38:30.720]  But he's a science Jesus, right?
[3:38:30.720 --> 3:38:33.720]  He's a science Jesus who's the new religious figure.
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:38.720]  And so they noticed that, you know, you can really craft pop culture to be like a religion.
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:40.720]  And politics is the exact same way.
[3:38:40.720 --> 3:38:41.720]  It functions like a cult.
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:43.720]  And so the figures are like these cult leaders.
[3:38:43.720 --> 3:38:44.720]  Definitely.
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:51.720]  Well, Katie Perry has gone all out for the Democratic Party in both Obama and Hillary campaigns.
[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:52.720]  Right.
[3:38:52.720 --> 3:39:02.720]  She hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008 and she was wearing a giant yellow dress emblazoned with Obama's larger than life face in sequence.
[3:39:02.720 --> 3:39:03.720]  Right.
[3:39:03.720 --> 3:39:05.720]  So entire dress of Obama.
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:13.720]  And then in 2008, I mean, in 2012, she performed in Nevada in a white dress printed with a ballot checked for Obama and Biden.
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:15.720]  Do you remember that thing?
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:21.720]  She performed in Milwaukee in a blue dress printed with Obama's forward slogan.
[3:39:21.720 --> 3:39:29.720]  And then in 2013, she performed as a sexy Uncle Sam for a children's concert for military families.
[3:39:29.720 --> 3:39:39.720]  And she really tried hard in 2016 by posting, I'm with her clothes and nails and performing at all of Hillary's rallies.
[3:39:39.720 --> 3:39:40.720]  Yeah.
[3:39:40.720 --> 3:39:45.720]  Well, I mean, it looks like this is a great example of like pop a culture.
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:46.720]  Yes.
[3:39:46.720 --> 3:39:47.720]  Right.
[3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:58.720]  So the wedding of these two ceremonies of these two domains into a mystical ceremony of the psychodrama, which is intended really to just mind control the public.
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:02.720]  So I think of a more helpful analogy would be like voodoo.
[3:40:02.720 --> 3:40:11.720]  It's like voodoo shamanism, basically, where the celebrities are like the voodoo, you know, performers and practitioners who sort of, you know, they put a spell on you with this.
[3:40:11.720 --> 3:40:15.720]  And then all the drones just sort of go along and go vote for whoever they say.
[3:40:15.720 --> 3:40:19.720]  I did that show with Owen last year about high profile rituals.
[3:40:19.720 --> 3:40:21.720]  So this goes exactly into that.
[3:40:21.720 --> 3:40:30.720]  They are inculcating the opinions of the Democrats and the left into their performance.
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:36.720]  You know, this is, I remember too, I went and watched a bunch of old nineties, early nineties MTV shows just for the heck of it.
[3:40:36.720 --> 3:40:39.720]  The other day I was doing some research on the nineties pop culture.
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:45.720]  I noticed in a lot of these MTV episodes, like the whole show was uploaded to YouTube with the commercials.
[3:40:45.720 --> 3:40:50.720]  And I started noticing all of these rock the vote commercials that I'd forgotten about because I grew up in the nineties.
[3:40:50.720 --> 3:40:54.720]  And you notice that it's all about like getting people out to vote for Bill Clinton.
[3:40:54.720 --> 3:40:55.720]  Right.
[3:40:55.720 --> 3:41:04.720]  So the whole rock the vote thing was a marriage between the Democratic Party and MTV to promote basically the Democratic Party.
[3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:09.720]  Well, maybe in the next segment, we will play a game called Democratic Convention or Coachella.
[3:41:09.720 --> 3:41:11.720]  Yeah, there you go.
[3:41:11.720 --> 3:41:20.720]  Because they always use the biggest pop stars of the day to influence people because they have
[3:41:20.720 --> 3:41:27.720]  And they always pick the most annoying of the boomer rock stars to him.
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:29.720]  What's his name?
[3:41:29.720 --> 3:41:31.720]  John Coomer Mellon camp.
[3:41:31.720 --> 3:41:32.720]  Right.
[3:41:32.720 --> 3:41:33.720]  Yeah.
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:36.720]  By the way, vote for Obama, if you please.
[3:41:36.720 --> 3:41:40.720]  You should have seen the lineup of the 2021 inaugural concert.
[3:41:40.720 --> 3:41:41.720]  Well, tell me.
[3:41:41.720 --> 3:41:42.720]  Yeah.
[3:41:42.720 --> 3:41:43.720]  Who's on this?
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:57.720]  So Beyonce, Mary J Blige, Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Cheryl Crowe, John Mellon Camp, Shakira, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Usher, Will I Am, Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Hudson, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Bonjomi, Devin Dolbato, Katy Perry, Flu Fighters, and it was hosted by Tom Hanks.
[3:41:57.720 --> 3:41:58.720]  Oh, man.
[3:41:58.720 --> 3:42:00.720]  So this is that wasn't just one concert.
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:01.720]  That was a couple of these.
[3:42:01.720 --> 3:42:02.720]  But all of these people.
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:13.720]  Yeah.
[3:42:13.720 --> 3:42:16.720]  They are using to garner support for the Democratic Party.
[3:42:16.720 --> 3:42:17.720]  Yeah.
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:19.720]  Well, the boss, he represents the working stuff.
[3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:20.720]  Right.
[3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:24.720]  And they're literally representing the working stuff.
[3:42:24.720 --> 3:42:25.720]  Right.
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:26.720]  Yeah.
[3:42:26.720 --> 3:42:28.720]  And he's wearing like cut off sleeves.
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:33.720]  And he's wearing jeans.
[3:42:33.720 --> 3:42:40.720]  Meanwhile, he's like being paid off by like global elites who want to destroy the country and make everybody poor.
[3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:41.720]  Good to do what?
[3:42:41.720 --> 3:42:45.720]  Maybe when you come back, if you're good enough.
[3:42:45.720 --> 3:42:46.720]  Okay.
[3:42:46.720 --> 3:42:47.720]  Bonjomi.
[3:42:47.720 --> 3:42:49.720]  I don't even know if I can do Bonjomi, but we'll experiment.
[3:42:49.720 --> 3:42:50.720]  All right.
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:51.720]  You're watching the LCK.
[3:42:51.720 --> 3:42:52.720]  This is Jay Dyer with Jamie Hansel.
[3:42:52.720 --> 3:42:53.720]  I don't go anywhere.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:54.720]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:57.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[3:42:57.720 --> 3:43:00.720]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[3:43:00.720 --> 3:43:04.720]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[3:43:04.720 --> 3:43:05.720]  I was born for this.
[3:43:05.720 --> 3:43:06.720]  You were born for this.
[3:43:06.720 --> 3:43:09.720]  And people are really waking up right now.
[3:43:09.720 --> 3:43:15.720]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[3:43:15.720 --> 3:43:27.720]  And now with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[3:43:27.720 --> 3:43:31.720]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[3:43:31.720 --> 3:43:38.720]  Info wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[3:43:38.720 --> 3:43:45.720]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[3:43:45.720 --> 3:43:48.720]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now.
[3:43:48.720 --> 3:43:55.720]  The mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[3:43:55.720 --> 3:44:05.720]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other.
[3:44:05.720 --> 3:44:08.720]  They were literally trying to create a post-human world.
[3:44:08.720 --> 3:44:16.720]  For the United States and Brazil, and of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK, nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[3:44:16.720 --> 3:44:19.720]  That's why they launched their great recess.
[3:44:19.720 --> 3:44:23.720]  And their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[3:44:23.720 --> 3:44:29.720]  This is nothing more than a top-down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[3:44:29.720 --> 3:44:37.720]  Because they couldn't take our guns, because we wouldn't bow, because the left, which is the ideology of this world government system, couldn't win.
[3:44:37.720 --> 3:44:40.720]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:44.720]  Now we know, two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[3:44:44.720 --> 3:44:48.720]  It's that simple. They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:52.720]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[3:44:52.720 --> 3:44:55.720]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[3:44:55.720 --> 3:45:04.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsStore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:10.720]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains are broken down.
[3:45:10.720 --> 3:45:16.720]  And InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[3:45:16.720 --> 3:45:21.720]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[3:45:21.720 --> 3:45:27.720]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever. It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[3:45:27.720 --> 3:45:35.720]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:44.720]  So listen up to 75% off at InfoWarsStore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation.

[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:10.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:25.720]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, John Kumert, Mellencamp from jasonalsis.com. This is my wife, Jamie Hanshall.
[3:47:25.720 --> 3:47:41.720]  I'm your host, John Kumert, and I'm your host, John Kumert.
[3:47:41.720 --> 3:47:59.720]  This also reminded me of Obama and Beyonce and Jay-Z. They were very close throughout the entire eight years of Obama's presidency,
[3:47:59.720 --> 3:48:11.720]  taking vacations together, Beyonce and Jay-Z going to the White House many, many times, even to private parties and private birthday parties. So Obama and Beyonce were besties.
[3:48:11.720 --> 3:48:30.720]  Don Podesta there, and it looks like he needs a little coral calcium, too. He's got some nasty meth teeth going on. Stephen Colbert looks like a demon. So tell us more about this.
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:41.720]  This distinguished personality, Elmo, graced the White House with his presence when he went to meet with First Lady Michelle Obama about healthy foods in the school cafeteria.
[3:48:41.720 --> 3:48:48.720]  Oh, Elmo liked Big Mike!
[3:48:48.720 --> 3:48:58.720]  And they were trying to use Muppet stickers to sell fruit to children. So fruit, vegetables, produce. I wonder if this had anything to do with, like, GMO things.
[3:48:58.720 --> 3:49:08.720]  Yeah, probably. I mean, yeah, I remember she was promoting this idea of healthy foods in school cafeterias. Of course, nothing of what she's promoting was actually healthy.
[3:49:08.720 --> 3:49:14.720]  I mean, I don't think fruits are necessarily bad, but I mean, fruits are just sugar.
[3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:18.720]  So, Elmo was there to talk about the importance of eating a...
[3:49:18.720 --> 3:49:27.720]  Well, she got a big bowl of freaking oatmeal. I like that's healthy. Like a giant bowl of tricks. Right? Like that's healthy.
[3:49:27.720 --> 3:49:32.720]  So they were talking about the importance of eating a rainbow of foods, they kept saying.
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:35.720]  Yeah, I wonder what that's about.
[3:49:35.720 --> 3:49:38.720]  So that is the importance of Elmo.
[3:49:38.720 --> 3:49:49.720]  Oh, Elmo liked Big Mike! Don't Big Mike run touchdown! Big Mac Limebaker!
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:50.720]  In 2017...
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:52.720]  Do you like to know who Big Mike is? Do you know who he is?
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:53.720]  Yes, it's Michelle.
[3:49:53.720 --> 3:49:59.720]  Well, Alex is the one I heard saying Big Mike. Every time he says Big Mike, it cracks me up.
[3:49:59.720 --> 3:50:01.720]  The idea of Elmo talking about Big Mike.
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:04.720]  Michael and Obama. I mean, Elmo.
[3:50:04.720 --> 3:50:10.720]  So then you've got what I call Biden's besties, which is Lady Gaga.
[3:50:10.720 --> 3:50:18.720]  In 2017, her and her buddy, she calls Joe Biden teamed up in a PSA, urging action against sexual assault.
[3:50:18.720 --> 3:50:24.720]  So that's pretty ironic. Wow. Because she says she's a sexual assault survivor and she...
[3:50:24.720 --> 3:50:25.720]  Well, he's a sniffer. I mean...
[3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:27.720]  I know!
[3:50:27.720 --> 3:50:30.720]  What do you think Lady Gaga smells like? We could ask Joe Biden.
[3:50:30.720 --> 3:50:32.720]  Hey, come on, man. She smells like meat.
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:34.720]  Does he wear that meat suit?
[3:50:34.720 --> 3:50:35.720]  The OTO perfume.
[3:50:35.720 --> 3:50:37.720]  Smells like steak. Steak, man.
[3:50:37.720 --> 3:50:40.720]  Come on, man. It smells like steak.
[3:50:40.720 --> 3:50:42.720]  Oh, because of her meat dress?
[3:50:42.720 --> 3:50:45.720]  Okay. But do you remember her perfume?
[3:50:45.720 --> 3:50:47.720]  Why would I remember Lady Gaga's perfume?
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:50.720]  Because it had blood and S-C-M-E-A.
[3:50:50.720 --> 3:50:52.720]  Oh, that's her Crowley perfume, right?
[3:50:52.720 --> 3:50:54.720]  Yeah. So she had her OTO perfume.
[3:50:54.720 --> 3:50:57.720]  You want to smell like a dirty satanic coomer?
[3:50:57.720 --> 3:50:58.720]  Right.
[3:50:58.720 --> 3:51:03.720]  So Lady Gaga and Biden are besties. And guess who else is besties with Biden?
[3:51:03.720 --> 3:51:05.720]  I'm trying to think of the worst possible people. Who?
[3:51:05.720 --> 3:51:07.720]  Cardi B.
[3:51:07.720 --> 3:51:16.720]  So Cardi B teamed up with Joe Biden for a Zoom call for Elle magazine to check about Cupid and about Trump and about police brutality
[3:51:16.720 --> 3:51:21.720]  and the upcoming 2020 election and how much she hated Trump.
[3:51:21.720 --> 3:51:26.720]  And she wanted everyone to vote for Biden because she cares about medical care.
[3:51:26.720 --> 3:51:32.720]  And her fans lined up to sing WAP at the White House.
[3:51:32.720 --> 3:51:36.720]  Well, we can't go into what that's about, but we all know what that's about.
[3:51:36.720 --> 3:51:43.720]  But to be fair, Cardi B also sat down with Bernie Sanders in a nail salon in Detroit
[3:51:43.720 --> 3:51:49.720]  to talk about politics. And Bernie's answers were much more cohesive than Biden's by far.
[3:51:49.720 --> 3:51:55.720]  Where's Cardi A? Are you the Cardi B? The backup? Where's the Cardi A?
[3:51:55.720 --> 3:51:59.720]  Get the Federal Reserve out of here. Let's look at this. Put a committee on it.
[3:51:59.720 --> 3:52:01.720]  Socialize Cardi B.
[3:52:01.720 --> 3:52:03.720]  There they are.
[3:52:03.720 --> 3:52:09.720]  Everyone deserves a piece of Cardi B. And bring back Cardi A, by the way.
[3:52:09.720 --> 3:52:14.720]  And our last celebrity of the day is Olivia Rodrigo.
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:17.720]  I don't even know who this pop star is. The new pop star.
[3:52:17.720 --> 3:52:19.720]  I don't even know who this is, but you told me about this.
[3:52:19.720 --> 3:52:26.720]  In July 2021, she visited the White House to talk to Dr. Fauci and Joe Biden
[3:52:26.720 --> 3:52:31.720]  to urge young people to get their stabs and how important it was for people
[3:52:31.720 --> 3:52:37.720]  under the age of 18 to get these because we care so much about our senior citizens
[3:52:37.720 --> 3:52:39.720]  and the people who are immunocompromised.
[3:52:39.720 --> 3:52:44.720]  I want to thank the pop star for being here with me. I don't remember her name.
[3:52:44.720 --> 3:52:49.720]  But be sure and get your black goon and no boosters.
[3:52:49.720 --> 3:52:57.720]  So she went to a briefing with Jen Psaki and talked about the importance of the stabs.
[3:52:57.720 --> 3:53:02.720]  And then she sat with Fauci brainstorming about how to peer pressure your friends into it
[3:53:02.720 --> 3:53:08.720]  if you're under 18 because vaccines help our bodies learn how to fight viruses
[3:53:08.720 --> 3:53:10.720]  and they help everyone.
[3:53:10.720 --> 3:53:14.720]  You know, I don't even think that for like a year into the coup,
[3:53:14.720 --> 3:53:18.720]  I had even ever heard Fauci talk. So I had no idea what he talked like.
[3:53:18.720 --> 3:53:21.720]  And I heard people doing impersonations of him.
[3:53:21.720 --> 3:53:23.720]  And I thought, huh, well, that's funny.
[3:53:23.720 --> 3:53:27.720]  I'd like to eventually hear what this guy actually sounds like.
[3:53:27.720 --> 3:53:33.720]  And then I finally heard an actual clip of him talking at the Rand Paul when they were questioning him.
[3:53:33.720 --> 3:53:38.720]  I couldn't believe that the impersonations aren't impersonation.
[3:53:38.720 --> 3:53:40.720]  I mean, that's really what it sounds like.
[3:53:40.720 --> 3:53:44.720]  He sounds like a guy in the corner who's selling things out of his jacket.
[3:53:44.720 --> 3:53:46.720]  Like, I got Madonna. I got...
[3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:50.720]  Well, but he sounds more like a guy who's opening up his jacket with nothing under it.
[3:53:50.720 --> 3:53:52.720]  Like that kind of a guy.
[3:53:52.720 --> 3:53:54.720]  Yeah. What do you need?
[3:53:54.720 --> 3:53:56.720]  No, like this flasher.
[3:53:56.720 --> 3:53:58.720]  Like he doesn't have any clothes on.
[3:53:58.720 --> 3:54:02.720]  Oh, yeah, come take a look at this.
[3:54:02.720 --> 3:54:04.720]  He really does.
[3:54:04.720 --> 3:54:07.720]  He's flashing his Pfizer all over town.
[3:54:07.720 --> 3:54:09.720]  All right. So, I mean, this is...
[3:54:09.720 --> 3:54:12.720]  Yeah, a lot of what you presented today, I didn't know any of that.
[3:54:12.720 --> 3:54:17.720]  I mean, and I like that you've brought in the newer pop stars because, you know, this is...
[3:54:17.720 --> 3:54:20.720]  It's an old phenomenon, but it continues on and they still do it.
[3:54:20.720 --> 3:54:23.720]  It's really transparent. It's totally hollow and ridiculous.
[3:54:23.720 --> 3:54:29.720]  I mean, we just saw the White House recruiting tech talkers to talk about geopolitics.
[3:54:29.720 --> 3:54:33.720]  I mean, that's literally the last person on the earth who would know anything about geopolitics.
[3:54:33.720 --> 3:54:35.720]  Tech talkers, are you serious?
[3:54:35.720 --> 3:54:41.720]  Torquing nurses. We're going to get our geopolitics from people that torque on TikTok, right?
[3:54:41.720 --> 3:54:46.720]  And they're all... Please go out there and promote helping Ukraine, help Ukraine.
[3:54:46.720 --> 3:54:49.720]  And people that don't even know what Ukraine is, right?
[3:54:49.720 --> 3:54:51.720]  This is so insane. This is so absurd.
[3:54:51.720 --> 3:54:53.720]  This is the... It's beyond dystopia.
[3:54:53.720 --> 3:54:58.720]  It's like, you know, when you read 1984 or you read Brave New World,
[3:54:58.720 --> 3:55:02.720]  and, you know, they had all this dark stuff and, you know, especially in 1984,
[3:55:02.720 --> 3:55:07.720]  and then Huxley gets right, you know, the elements of it is not that hardcore.
[3:55:07.720 --> 3:55:09.720]  It's more of like a drug to dystopia.
[3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:12.720]  But both of them missed the clown show.
[3:55:12.720 --> 3:55:16.720]  Where is the cartoonish clown show element that those guys missed?
[3:55:16.720 --> 3:55:20.720]  I mean, I don't think they could have conceived of the dystopia being this preposterous.
[3:55:20.720 --> 3:55:22.720]  It is very circus-like.
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:28.720]  And I just saw a podcaster talking about how she voted for Biden because he quoted Hamilton.
[3:55:28.720 --> 3:55:32.720]  But she didn't even know that the quote from Hamilton was quoting the Constitution.
[3:55:32.720 --> 3:55:37.720]  She just thought it was a great quote from the play Hamilton, which she liked and Biden liked.
[3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:39.720]  So that's how Biden won her vote.
[3:55:39.720 --> 3:55:42.720]  Yeah. Well, you know, there's this... I'm pretty sure it's not day four,
[3:55:42.720 --> 3:55:49.720]  but there's a line where basically Winston realizes that in the dystopia,
[3:55:49.720 --> 3:55:53.720]  you can contradict yourself from one sentence to the next.
[3:55:53.720 --> 3:55:57.720]  And people don't even realize that that's a contradiction.
[3:55:57.720 --> 3:56:03.720]  They're so initiated into the double think, which is like a spell.
[3:56:03.720 --> 3:56:06.720]  It's like you're bound to the spell where you fall for it,
[3:56:06.720 --> 3:56:09.720]  and you continually sort of double down and you can't get out of it.
[3:56:09.720 --> 3:56:10.720]  It's a trap.
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:12.720]  And I mean, it's literally a death cult.
[3:56:12.720 --> 3:56:18.720]  And what all of these pop celebrity people are promoting is the same death cult that the politicians
[3:56:18.720 --> 3:56:19.720]  are a part of.
[3:56:19.720 --> 3:56:20.720]  They're all part of a death cult.
[3:56:20.720 --> 3:56:21.720]  It's that simple.
[3:56:21.720 --> 3:56:26.720]  And I was just reminded one last figure that I've forgotten about, Jane Fonda.
[3:56:26.720 --> 3:56:28.720]  So she's Hollywood royalty.
[3:56:28.720 --> 3:56:36.720]  And then she went into politics and had a lot of radical movement centered around her.
[3:56:36.720 --> 3:56:37.720]  Do you remember that?
[3:56:37.720 --> 3:56:39.720]  So it's just the list goes on and on.
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:41.720]  You can find a lot more.
[3:56:41.720 --> 3:56:44.720]  Yeah. Well, think again, the Laurel Kenyon scene, right?
[3:56:44.720 --> 3:56:49.720]  I mean, the whole point of that last info wars was actually was two shows back when I covered
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:54.720]  the Dave McGowan Laurel Kenyon scene material where he talked about how a lot of the musicians
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:57:00.720]  of the counterculture, they were all coming out of prominent Hollywood royalty and industrial
[3:57:00.720 --> 3:57:02.720]  complex and deep state families.
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:03.720]  And you mentioned Fonda.
[3:57:03.720 --> 3:57:05.720]  I mean, Dern, right?
[3:57:05.720 --> 3:57:09.720]  Peter Fonda, the Derns, I mean, they come out of these prominent families.
[3:57:09.720 --> 3:57:13.720]  And that's always been the case with Hollywood and the music scene.
[3:57:13.720 --> 3:57:16.720]  So the counterculture isn't really counterculture, right?
[3:57:16.720 --> 3:57:20.720]  All of these pop stars that we're talking about, they're all bought and paid for.
[3:57:20.720 --> 3:57:23.720]  They're just shills for anything anti-human.
[3:57:23.720 --> 3:57:26.720]  And so that's why they also all promote transhumanism.
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:29.720]  So counterculture is just another arm of the establishment.
[3:57:29.720 --> 3:57:30.720]  Exactly.
[3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:31.720]  And that's the message.
[3:57:31.720 --> 3:57:32.720]  That's the great takeaway here.
[3:57:32.720 --> 3:57:34.720]  So these pop culture figures aren't counterculture.
[3:57:34.720 --> 3:57:39.720]  They're one in a percent to put it simply, illuminating mind control puppets, basically.
[3:57:39.720 --> 3:57:40.720]  All right.
[3:57:40.720 --> 3:57:41.720]  Thank you guys so much.

[3:58:36.720 --> 3:58:38.720]  natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[3:58:38.720 --> 3:58:41.720]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[3:58:41.720 --> 3:58:46.720]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[3:58:46.720 --> 3:58:51.720]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure
[3:58:51.720 --> 3:58:53.720]  what's happening in the atmosphere.
[3:58:53.720 --> 3:58:57.720]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about NASA and other governments
[3:58:57.720 --> 3:59:01.720]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the climate.
[3:59:01.720 --> 3:59:07.720]  The only constant, the only great truth is change is the only constant.
[3:59:07.720 --> 3:59:10.720]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[3:59:10.720 --> 3:59:14.720]  But notice first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's going
[3:59:14.720 --> 3:59:17.720]  to be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to.
[3:59:17.720 --> 3:59:19.720]  Okay, now it's just climate change.
[3:59:19.720 --> 3:59:24.720]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[3:59:24.720 --> 3:59:28.720]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[3:59:28.720 --> 3:59:29.720]  They have.
[3:59:29.720 --> 3:59:31.720]  Weather control trees from 1979.
[3:59:31.720 --> 3:59:35.720]  Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very long time.
[3:59:35.720 --> 3:59:40.720]  In fact, back in 1994, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[3:59:40.720 --> 3:59:42.720]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[3:59:42.720 --> 4:00:06.720]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
