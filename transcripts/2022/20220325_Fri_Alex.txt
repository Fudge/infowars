[00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:04.790]  With regard to food shortages, yes, we did talk about food shortages.
[00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.491]  And it's going to be real.
[00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.272]  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia.
[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:18.654]  It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.
[00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:20.814]  Here's the big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:33.216]   Whenever Joe Biden came out last week and said we're in a new world order, And then he said it again on, what, Monday, and it got a lot of attention.
[00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:41.181]  People need to listen very, very carefully to what he said.
[00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:45.423]  60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.
[00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:53.388]  And since then, we've established a liberal world order, and that hadn't happened in a long while.
[00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:55.829]  A lot of people died, but nowhere near the chaos.
[00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.479]  And now's the time when things are shifting.
[00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.080]  There's going to be a new world order out there.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.580]  And we've got to lead it.
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.421]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:17.783]  He was explaining that, in his own halting babble, that 60 million people were killed in war, in World War II.
[00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:22.624]  Of course, there's a lot more than 60 million people, but that's a conservative number.
[00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:25.431]  And he was explaining that.
[00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:33.854]  And he said, then we got a liberal new world order that stopped all that, which that's not true, and that that world order is about to be over.
[00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:38.016]  And that a new world order is going to be here, and that the U.S.
[00:01:38.076 --> 00:01:38.676]  is going to lead it.
[00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:45.319]  I'll explain what type of new world order they're setting up, and I think you already know, it's called the Great Reset.
[00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:52.599]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:58.599]  [Music]
[00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:02.206]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:02.746]  Today.
[00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:04.568]  I'll see you again!
[00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:15.667]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.627]  I'll see you again.
[00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:27.987]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:30.187]  Coming down fast, we're miles above you.
[00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:40.187]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:35.039]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.562]  I am back in the saddle and honored to be here.
[00:02:38.582 --> 00:02:44.567]  All right, I'll give you an update on the little health thing that's gone on the last few days.
[00:02:45.168 --> 00:02:48.090]  We'll come back next segment, but I've gotten a bunch of tests came in.
[00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.871]  All is good.
[00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.132]  Mystery was solved.
[00:02:50.172 --> 00:02:53.334]  I'll tell you about that next segment when some stations join us.
[00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:55.997]  Look, here's the deal.
[00:02:57.847 --> 00:03:04.272]  People ask me a lot on the street, but also my family, how are you taking all these attacks and all this demonization, Alex?
[00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:08.255]  And my answer is, that's the least of our problems.
[00:03:09.637 --> 00:03:19.224]  Major world war, economic collapse, mass starvation, complete collapse of the third world, flooding the first world, that's the great reset plan.
[00:03:20.345 --> 00:03:23.067]  And that's how I keep predicting everything that's happening.
[00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:26.117]  I'm the captain of my own life.
[00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:29.098]  I'm trying to get everybody else to be the captains of their lives.
[00:03:30.018 --> 00:03:36.781]  And I'm really trying to get people to stand up and wake up and get engaged and get involved.
[00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:47.183]  so that we don't go into a major calamity.
[00:03:47.183 --> 00:03:51.063]   If I didn't think we could at least have a safer crash landing,
[00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:51.903]  Thank you.
[00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:53.758]  We're crashing for sure.
[00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:54.998]  We're in the middle of it.
[00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:56.639]  I wouldn't still be on air.
[00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:57.639]  I would have evacuated.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.600]  Probably out of the United States.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.661]  This is going to be the epicenter of an artificial civil war.
[00:04:03.922 --> 00:04:08.184]  Everybody else is just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:16.988]  So we're going to be talking about all of this and a lot more here on the broadcast today.
[00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:27.345]   But when you see the circus out there, of this Supreme Court nominee who can't say what a woman is.
[00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:40.596]  And you see everything else that's happening, know that this is all by design, run by a very wicked, very evil behavioral psychologist that can only capture us by making us insane.
[00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:42.438]  There's a great meme going around.
[00:04:43.158 --> 00:04:44.840]  It's got an image of Kavanaugh.
[00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.740]  And that woman that made up all that crap about him, it's been confirmed she made it up.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.362]  Bunch of women have gone to jail that got caught actually telling lies that didn't exist, they were just total frauds.
[00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:58.183]  Believe all women, we're told.
[00:04:59.283 --> 00:05:06.785]  And then, there's a Republican nominee who's a woman, and then we're told, oh, only some women.
[00:05:07.746 --> 00:05:14.868]  And now it's, what's a woman, with the new Supreme Court nominee, very, very sick.
[00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.199]  Situation.
[00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.540]  We've got all that to go over.
[00:05:21.602 --> 00:05:25.144]  There's also a bunch of news confirming from England to the U.S.
[00:05:25.164 --> 00:05:36.071]  to Sweden that they were ordered to kill old people and not give them health care and to just give them morphine while they were put on ventilators to kill them with the ventilator.
[00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:40.834]  Because you give them morphine or other strong opiates and then put them on a ventilator, it'll kill you.
[00:05:41.175 --> 00:05:43.096]  And they knew and gave the order worldwide to kill.
[00:05:44.158 --> 00:05:45.018]  That's a pretty big deal.
[00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:46.399]  That's mainstream news.
[00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:47.959]  They're just reporting it like it's no big deal.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.941]  And of course we have the really big news we'll cover right when we come back.
[00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:57.222]  The war and the economic collapse that again is orchestrated.
[00:05:58.083 --> 00:06:01.424]  And Biden's saying it's all because of Russia.
[00:06:01.524 --> 00:06:03.024]  That's why the gas has exploded.
[00:06:03.064 --> 00:06:06.306]  And that's why he says you will have food shortages now.
[00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:14.757]   Now food shortages and massive inflation in the United States Means people going bankrupt, people on the street, people moving in with their families.
[00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:19.239]  People, you know, dying from stress trying to make ends meet.
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.783]  But in Africa, and in Latin America, and in some areas of the Middle East and Asia, it is a death sentence.
[00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:30.104]  Because in those countries, there's not welfare, you just starve to death.
[00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:32.605]  So we'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:40.049]  Well, Katonji Brown-Jackson can't find her ass with both hands.
[00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:42.774]  But you know, that's not really true.
[00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:58.085]  She knows good and well we're living in a brainwashed cult, and that you're not allowed to define a woman, only the globalists and the biomedical tyranny are, because they're putting chemicals in the food and water to make us basically sexless, hermaphroditic drones.
[00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:05.091]  And of course, I've been telling you for 28 years on air, that's the plan, because I read the book.
[00:07:06.004 --> 00:07:20.375]  By the head family running the global eugenics operation that founded the UN, the Huxleys, and they wrote a book in 31 telling you the plan that was fiction called Brave New World, and then they wrote a non-fiction he did in 61 when he was dying of cancer.
[00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:21.816]  He gave a Berkeley speech.
[00:07:21.836 --> 00:07:23.898]  You can go read the book and listen to the speech.
[00:07:23.918 --> 00:07:29.382]  It's only an hour long where he lays out how this is indeed real and how they're going to do this to you.
[00:07:30.023 --> 00:07:31.624]  So I have their damn blueprint.
[00:07:32.024 --> 00:07:33.545]  You have their damn blueprint.
[00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:43.708]  How do you think I got up here on air and said you're gonna see major war break out in Asia and in Eastern Europe by late February?
[00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:54.550]  Because I have a lot of high-level sources and I can also see the propaganda and the movements and things were happening in the military, in the corporate world, at every level.
[00:07:55.711 --> 00:08:01.552]  And now it came out last week that China was looking to invade Taiwan simultaneously but didn't.
[00:08:02.662 --> 00:08:05.103]  And is now looking to go in this fall.
[00:08:07.503 --> 00:08:09.243]  And they just seized some more islands today.
[00:08:09.303 --> 00:08:11.544]  I mean, all hell's just breaking loose, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:24.067]  But there's nothing more frustrating, nothing more frustrating than having the globalist battle plan and knowing what cards are in their hand.
[00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:27.527]  You don't know what they're going to play next, but you know, limitedly, what they can play.
[00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.468]  So in a way, you do know.
[00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:43.146]  And then to just sit here and be attacked by the whole political system constantly trying to put me in jail, constantly trying to sue us out of existence, constantly trying to deplatform us and debank us and the rest of it.
[00:08:44.747 --> 00:09:02.697]   And I just don't think even the listeners of this show realize that InfoWars is a canary in the coal mine and a real weather vane or bellwether, a gauge, a sensor, a detector, Of where everybody else is about to be.
[00:09:03.997 --> 00:09:08.058]  Just like Trump would always say, they're trying to get through me to get to you.
[00:09:08.958 --> 00:09:09.918]  And he was absolutely right.
[00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:11.979]  And DeSantis makes that same point.
[00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:15.460]  Boy, DeSantis just gets better and better by the minute.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.241]  Better than Trump, I would say, in his policies and what he's up to.
[00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:22.602]  But I'm not trying to pick favorites here.
[00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:26.763]  At least Trump has shut up about the poison shot, at least isn't pushing it anymore.
[00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:27.883]  That's enough for me.
[00:09:29.588 --> 00:09:32.810]  But here's the big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:53.202]  Whenever Joe Biden came out last week and said we're in a new world order, and then he said it again on, what, Monday, and it got a lot of attention, people need to listen very, very carefully to what he said.
[00:09:53.723 --> 00:09:57.785]  And we're going to play that clip next segment.
[00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:09.619]   He was explaining that In his own halting babble, that 60 million people were killed in war, in World War II.
[00:10:09.659 --> 00:10:14.602]  Of course, there's a lot more than 60 million people, but that's a conservative number.
[00:10:16.543 --> 00:10:25.789]  And he was explaining that, and he said, then we got a liberal New World Order that stopped all that, which that's not true, and that that world order is about to be over.
[00:10:27.113 --> 00:10:29.974]  And that a New World Order is going to be here, and that the U.S.
[00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:30.634]  is going to lead it.
[00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:36.196]  I'll explain what type of New World Order they're setting up, but I think you already know.
[00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:37.296]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:40.477]  The new headline is all over the news.
[00:10:40.518 --> 00:10:41.978]  The Davos Group calls the shots.
[00:10:42.038 --> 00:10:43.198]  The media clicks their heels.
[00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:46.019]  The academics and government officials click their heels.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:53.462]  Bugs now being served on trendy menus at trendy restaurants all over the Western world.
[00:10:55.293 --> 00:10:59.955]  Everything from fly larva gravy to mealworm hamburgers.
[00:11:04.017 --> 00:11:18.663]  It just gets grosser and grosser because they have to train you to accept the destruction of all that is good and decent and that your instincts tell you is good and decent.
[00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:20.764]  They want you to go against your instincts.
[00:11:22.295 --> 00:11:29.641]  We've also got that here in Austin with this elementary school that locks the children in so parents can't get in and then teaches them how to use sex toys.
[00:11:30.202 --> 00:11:32.443]  We're talking about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 year olds.
[00:11:32.964 --> 00:11:42.532]  And then has them march around in basically rainbow gangster attire as they are inducted into the pedophilic sex cult.
[00:11:44.073 --> 00:11:46.936]  And even again Bill Maher says it's wrong to be sexualizing children.
[00:11:47.496 --> 00:11:57.129]   This is exactly The laws that DeSantis is trying to pass to keep these groomers away from your children.
[00:11:57.169 --> 00:12:02.413]  Because at the bottom of the barrel, the Democratic Party, is a sexualization of children.
[00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:05.815]  Look at this video out of middle school here in Austin, or elementary school, excuse me.
[00:12:06.396 --> 00:12:09.538]  The children wearing masks because they're prisoners in the cult.
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.685]  Going around worshiping and discussing how wonderful it is to have sex with the same sex.
[00:12:17.526 --> 00:12:21.890]  Something, imagine if a mom and dad were just teaching five-year-olds or six-year-olds or seven-year-olds or eight-year-olds this.
[00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.012]  You'd say, those parents are perverts, they're weirdos.
[00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:25.694]  Kids aren't thinking about those type of things.
[00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:28.877]  This is pure imprinting, pure grooming.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.901]  We got all the leftists going into the big...
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.923]  City Councils and Congressional hearings and saying, we are grooming your children.
[00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:42.745]  We are going to get your children.
[00:12:43.265 --> 00:12:44.326]  They are ours now.
[00:12:46.027 --> 00:12:47.848]  You have these whacked out zombies.
[00:12:51.308 --> 00:13:03.695]  Teaching them all this and then getting the children to say who they're attracted to sexually and then filling it out and giving papers to the teacher so they can then encourage them and have them get up in front of the class and say, I'm a five-year-old boy and I like boys.
[00:13:03.975 --> 00:13:07.557]  Well, of course you like boys when you're a boy, as in want to play with them.
[00:13:08.077 --> 00:13:09.798]  You don't understand what they're saying.
[00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:11.659]  Girls like girls too.
[00:13:11.919 --> 00:13:18.563]  So they're trying to confuse them, create a definition in the school system towards transgenderism and sterilization.
[00:13:21.215 --> 00:13:23.337]  I mean, whoa, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:23.897 --> 00:13:27.180]  Whether it's heterosexual or homosexual, all of it is pedophilic and evil.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.181]  That's coming up as well.
[00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:35.528]  Also the left celebrating Clarence Thomas being sick and now going after his wife, saying they need to have her arrested for the insurrection.
[00:13:36.609 --> 00:13:41.293]  Congress has her text messages and is having a bunch of fun where she said, hey, let's fight them still in this election.
[00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:44.176]  Hey, you're not allowed to say you're going to say no to us.
[00:13:44.696 --> 00:13:51.380]  Democrats said they were going to challenge the election no matter what happened and wouldn't accept the results and then they were going to have their own inauguration and would even have a civil war!
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.603]  The New York Times said the Democrats war game with Hillary and Obama and Biden and John Podesta.
[00:13:57.643 --> 00:14:00.445]  That was in the New York Times that they were going to have a physical war.
[00:14:01.706 --> 00:14:11.071]  But then she, Clarence Thomas's wife, who is a patriot, sent text messages to the White House even staff saying, hey, you need to challenge this fraud.
[00:14:11.091 --> 00:14:12.392]  You need to politically do this.
[00:14:13.246 --> 00:14:17.549]  How dare her talk in America about challenging an election.
[00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:19.790]  They got all that coming up.
[00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:24.413]  Man, it's a crazy time in America.
[00:14:25.553 --> 00:14:32.017]  There's also some other news that I haven't gotten, uh, which really haven't talked about in depth.
[00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:34.438]  We talked about it briefly yesterday, and, you know, he's a tough guy.
[00:14:34.458 --> 00:14:37.980]  She doesn't care, but we do need to talk about it.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.962]  We need to make a big deal about it, though, when we finally get around to it.
[00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:41.943]  The Fed's called.
[00:14:44.164 --> 00:15:04.475]  About Owen, and they said something really evil, really unprecedented, and they, because see, the Democrats in the deep state believe they have a free hand with America, they can commit any crime they want, do anything they want, and it's pretty incredible how they operate.
[00:15:05.695 --> 00:15:10.538]  So at some point here in the next few days, maybe Monday or so, Owen, I'll tell you, I'm sure he's going to want to talk about it.
[00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:14.660]  About what the Feds called up his lawyer and said.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.102]  You can probably imagine what they said.
[00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:23.384]  But I guess they really just misjudged all of us and who we are.
[00:15:23.444 --> 00:15:24.564]  We're not people like them.
[00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:28.726]  Mafia type individuals.
[00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:32.167]  This country is in terminal collapse right now.
[00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:35.788]  And we'll come back with Biden bragging about it and saying it's going to be really painful.
[00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:38.829]  There will be mass food shortages and starvation worldwide.
[00:15:38.849 --> 00:15:39.490]  It's already happening.
[00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:41.113]  It's all Russia's fault.
[00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:42.653]  It's not the Great Recess or the lockdown.
[00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:43.154]  I didn't tell you.
[00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:47.034]  Probably 2,000 times in the last 26 months, this is what happened right around this time.
[00:15:47.795 --> 00:15:48.695]  No, no, it's all Russia.
[00:15:49.275 --> 00:15:49.675]  That's right.
[00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:53.196]  And now we're going to watch hundreds of millions of Africans die.
[00:15:54.516 --> 00:15:55.476]  But that's OK.
[00:15:55.596 --> 00:15:57.136]  Just don't use the N-word, OK?
[00:15:57.477 --> 00:15:59.637]  You can kill all the black people you want.
[00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:01.877]  Just don't use that magic N-word.
[00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:07.098]  Don't be looking for all the cool black hip-hop stars and rappers.
[00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:09.299]  Everybody talk about actual murder of Africans.
[00:16:10.962 --> 00:16:39.317]   So, the puppet president of the United States, Joe Biden, at the snap NATO summit he calls so he can grandstand around the war and try to boost his approval ratings, has blamed, ladies and gentlemen, The Russians, for the food price increases and the inflation, when it's the private central banks of the US, the European Union, China and Japan, has been absolutely horrible as well.
[00:16:40.118 --> 00:16:43.941]  Massively monetizing debt and just turning the printing presses up.
[00:16:44.341 --> 00:16:45.202]  Japan for 40 years.
[00:16:46.503 --> 00:16:47.044]  And the U.S.
[00:16:47.064 --> 00:16:50.447]  has accelerated it, as you know, the last 20 or so, and so has China.
[00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.890]  So there's been a race, and people just keep getting all this money.
[00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:02.157]  Now the inflation's kicking in, and oh, oh, it's Vladimir, it's Vladimir Putin's fault.
[00:17:02.197 --> 00:17:02.598]  Here it is.
[00:17:04.005 --> 00:17:04.965]  Nothing more to report.
[00:17:05.485 --> 00:17:09.746]  With regard to food shortages, yes we did talk about food shortages.
[00:17:10.786 --> 00:17:12.447]  And it's going to be real.
[00:17:13.147 --> 00:17:17.227]  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia.
[00:17:17.847 --> 00:17:23.608]  It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.
[00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:31.170]  So again, let's play that one more time and let that sink in on the food situation.
[00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.750]  Go ahead and play it again.
[00:17:32.455 --> 00:17:33.396]  Nothing more to report.
[00:17:33.936 --> 00:17:38.198]  With regard to food shortages, yes we did talk about food shortages.
[00:17:39.218 --> 00:17:40.899]  And it's going to be real.
[00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:45.661]  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia.
[00:17:46.302 --> 00:17:52.064]  It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.
[00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.226]  Which of course is true!
[00:17:56.877 --> 00:18:18.110]  When you cut off the second largest fertilizer supplier in the world, when you cut off the second largest oil supplier in the world, it's going to cause even bigger problems on top of the inflation that was already accelerating, and we all know that, and there's national polls out, over 70% of Americans know it's Joe Biden, it's the globalists.
[00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.172]  But do they know it's by design?
[00:18:20.192 --> 00:18:21.673]  Do they know it's part of the Great Reset?
[00:18:22.554 --> 00:18:23.274]  I have a clip here.
[00:18:24.115 --> 00:18:25.416]  In fact, let's skip to this clip.
[00:18:26.216 --> 00:18:27.237]  Let's play clip 17.
[00:18:27.877 --> 00:18:34.261]  This is, Biden says, this crisis also presents an opportunity for investment in clean energy.
[00:18:34.581 --> 00:18:37.182]  And what has the head of the Energy Department said?
[00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:39.424]  What has the head of the Department of Transportation said?
[00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:40.985]  What have they all said?
[00:18:41.005 --> 00:18:43.666]  They've all said, oh, we could lower gas prices.
[00:18:44.727 --> 00:18:46.288]  We can lower electricity prices.
[00:18:46.328 --> 00:18:49.850]  We've chosen not to, to make you transition off fossil fuel.
[00:18:50.987 --> 00:18:51.948]  The windmills don't work.
[00:18:52.028 --> 00:18:53.129]  The solar panels break.
[00:18:53.769 --> 00:18:56.431]  They use as much carbon to produce them as they ever basically gain.
[00:18:56.732 --> 00:18:57.512]  It's all a scam.
[00:18:57.532 --> 00:19:01.476]  They have enough coal to go for thousands of years.
[00:19:01.876 --> 00:19:03.017]  And it's good for the environment.
[00:19:03.237 --> 00:19:03.657]  It's good.
[00:19:03.677 --> 00:19:05.799]  It creates carbon dioxide plant spray.
[00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:11.304]  But it doesn't matter because they want to depopulate.
[00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:12.385]  Oh, look!
[00:19:13.746 --> 00:19:15.047]  Jeff Bezos' wife.
[00:19:17.571 --> 00:19:22.773]  Just gave hundreds of millions of dollars specifically earmarking abortions of black babies.
[00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:24.794]  Oh, but they're liberal!
[00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:34.417]  They gave money to Black Lives Matter, whose main mission is ending the nuclear family and getting black men to turn trans and have their penises and testicles removed.
[00:19:34.597 --> 00:19:35.958]  Folks, that's official.
[00:19:35.978 --> 00:19:40.019]  I mean, they really don't like black people.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.360]  And what's the average black male like?
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:43.521]  He's just like a liberal white.
[00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:46.722]  He's out there going on political correctness out there.
[00:19:48.837 --> 00:20:05.310]  I saw some comedian at Joe's club where he is a resident at Vulcan Gas Company get in his face and say, how dare you use the n-word and all this stuff when Joe invited him there to be there just to try to, you know, act like a stud or act cool.
[00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:14.296]  And I guarantee you talk to that guy about targeting black babies for abortion or the world starvation mainly of Africans under this plan, he doesn't care.
[00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:17.519]  He just wants to get points with the corporate media and the system.
[00:20:19.215 --> 00:20:20.775]  I may even play that clip a little bit later.
[00:20:21.295 --> 00:20:24.836]  Pat Riley was showing it to me the other day, and I forgot to send it to Scott.
[00:20:25.216 --> 00:20:26.797]  Guys, call Riley and get him to send it to you.
[00:20:27.197 --> 00:20:27.857]  He's got the clip.
[00:20:29.317 --> 00:20:34.578]  And again, it's this holier-than-thou attitude, like, oh, you're a white person, so you're bad.
[00:20:34.898 --> 00:20:47.681]  The liberal corporate media told me so, who wants us all divided and conquered and killing each other and all basing our ideas on race, so we never base it on liberty and freedom and a code that lifts us all up.
[00:20:49.887 --> 00:20:58.600]   Until they turn minorities out of the majority worldwide, 90% of the world's not white, into white-hating Bigots.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.161]  And then the globalists have the world set for where it wants to go.
[00:21:02.601 --> 00:21:06.643]  Planetary racial division and control, where we're all like a big prison.
[00:21:07.103 --> 00:21:14.945]  We got the blacks, the Hispanics, and the whites, and every group's racially based, and the warden controls everyone by race.
[00:21:15.306 --> 00:21:22.068]  And we are a prison planet controlled by racial manipulation and LGBT brainwashing designed to screw up our children.
[00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:26.431]  Absolutely cold-blooded, absolutely evil, and you've got a soul.
[00:21:26.731 --> 00:21:29.473]  You've got to reject the whole thing and say no to it.
[00:21:29.813 --> 00:21:33.216]  This is not, and I don't say this to curry favor with the LGBT people.
[00:21:33.896 --> 00:21:34.737]  I say this is the truth.
[00:21:35.297 --> 00:21:38.019]  I don't hate someone because they like the same sex as an adult.
[00:21:39.179 --> 00:21:49.447]  I hate the agenda of targeting children, period, and the whole, quote, gay agenda being globalist, being anti-gun, anti-family, and being signed on to dehumanization and transhumanism.
[00:21:49.988 --> 00:21:52.210]  Keep your dirty, evil hands off children.
[00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:58.195]  I don't care if you're a heterosexual pedophile or a homosexual pedophile, you need to go to prison.
[00:22:00.116 --> 00:22:00.677]  Continuing.
[00:22:00.797 --> 00:22:02.178]  I mean, it's not even a Trojan horse anymore.
[00:22:02.198 --> 00:22:05.561]  They're not even hiding that the gay agenda is really a pedophile agenda now.
[00:22:06.568 --> 00:22:13.436]  And so we need people who've been pro-LGBT like Bill Maher to come out against it and say, keep your hands off the kids.
[00:22:13.516 --> 00:22:14.617]  What the hell's your problem?
[00:22:14.857 --> 00:22:18.481]  And then he gets shouted down because this is driven by a pedophile.
[00:22:19.262 --> 00:22:22.886]  The LGBT bus is driven by a pedophile.
[00:22:23.546 --> 00:22:23.907]  Period.
[00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:35.424]  But again, it's about cutting the resources off while dividing us, conquering us, and getting rid of the family because it's a strong institution where people owe allegiance to that family.
[00:22:35.665 --> 00:22:36.905]  It's the original gang.
[00:22:37.486 --> 00:22:47.892]  And replacing it with gangs of whites, and blacks, and Asians, and Hispanics, and this, and that, and Muslim, and Christian, and gay, and straight, and this, and that.
[00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:50.013]  All divided into gangs.
[00:22:50.393 --> 00:22:51.034]  Gang rule.
[00:22:51.694 --> 00:22:52.295]  Fascism.
[00:22:52.555 --> 00:22:55.897]  All these separate groups tied together in the broken coalition strategy.
[00:22:57.469 --> 00:23:00.791]  Here's Biden talking about the crisis also presents an opportunity.
[00:23:01.411 --> 00:23:03.592]  This crisis also presents an opportunity.
[00:23:04.712 --> 00:23:05.493]  It's a catalyst.
[00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:14.777]  A catalyst that will drive the investments we need to double down on our clean energy goals and accelerate progress toward our net zero emissions future.
[00:23:15.538 --> 00:23:17.919]  That's what the second part of this initiative is all about.
[00:23:18.899 --> 00:23:26.583]  The United States and the European Union are going to work together to take concrete measures to reduce dependence on natural gas, period.
[00:23:28.658 --> 00:23:31.600]  So, oh, natural gas burns basically clean.
[00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:34.481]  They don't care.
[00:23:34.501 --> 00:23:35.082]  They want it gone.
[00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:39.264]  Everything's got to go, you see, because you're being put into feudalism.
[00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:46.208]  You're being put into serfdom while they are above the law and do whatever they want, however they want, in any way they want.
[00:23:46.448 --> 00:23:47.489]  I got to play this short clip.
[00:23:47.509 --> 00:23:49.130]  This is Biden asked about World War III.
[00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.992]  This is how moronic the press is and warmongering.
[00:23:53.272 --> 00:23:55.654]  They even make the Crypt Keeper look smart.
[00:23:55.694 --> 00:23:56.034]  Here it is.
[00:23:57.503 --> 00:23:58.604]  Cecilia, ABC.
[00:23:59.684 --> 00:24:02.506]  There you are.
[00:24:03.566 --> 00:24:08.849]  Sir, you've made it very clear in this conflict that you do not want to see World War III.
[00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:17.633]  But is it possible that in expressing that so early that you were too quick to rule out direct military intervention in this war?
[00:24:17.833 --> 00:24:23.216]  Could Putin have been emboldened knowing that you are not going to get involved directly in this conflict?
[00:24:24.036 --> 00:24:24.557]  No and no.
[00:24:27.686 --> 00:24:32.570]  And there's many layers of lies there, and we'll come back and get to that, and get to his New World Order comment that I said I'd get to this segment.
[00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:35.773]  But I'm sure you pick up on the layers of lies there, though.
[00:24:35.833 --> 00:24:38.055]  Part of what he says is true, the rest is a lie.
[00:24:38.275 --> 00:24:38.656]  The U.S.
[00:24:38.716 --> 00:24:43.060]  is directly involved with Russia, we're at war with Russia, been at war with Russia for eight years.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.620]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.682]  Alright, we're back.
[00:24:47.793 --> 00:24:54.058]  I'm going to get into the situation the world's facing, not to scare you, but so you can get prepared.
[00:24:54.218 --> 00:25:02.604]  And I think most listeners understand now that you don't have to just go off my predictions and think, well, maybe he's going to be right.
[00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:04.485]  We're now living the financial collapse.
[00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:06.987]  We're living the economic collapse.
[00:25:07.147 --> 00:25:10.289]  We are living the food infrastructure collapse.
[00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.892]  We are living through our energy being purposely turned off.
[00:25:15.157 --> 00:25:22.820]  And things are going to get very rough in America and Europe, in places like Japan, and in areas like China.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:32.784]  They're going to have even bigger problems for the first world, and then in the third world, it is going to be an absolute death sentence for hundreds and hundreds of millions of people.
[00:25:33.044 --> 00:25:39.887]  And that information is not even being denied now by the very globalists that are orchestrating this.
[00:25:39.947 --> 00:25:48.830]   So when you talk about evil, These people are killing way more than Hitler and Mao, who were the two biggest killers in history.
[00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.031]  Lenin and Stalin are close third and fourths.
[00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:55.713]  But China killed 100 million of their people, they admit.
[00:25:56.333 --> 00:26:00.655]  Hitler was responsible for the death and killing of 30 million people overall.
[00:26:01.756 --> 00:26:03.137]  Even more if you count the Germans that died.
[00:26:04.317 --> 00:26:08.039]  And then you got Lenin and Stalin close, as I said, third and fourth places.
[00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.100]  This is not a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:11.027 --> 00:26:13.911]  And so, oh, but they're dying by starvation, so it's okay.
[00:26:14.612 --> 00:26:24.165]  And the IMF and World Bank give the orders to those countries, you'll get billions of dollars that the dictators and corrupt politicians get if you cut the medicine off and cut the food off.
[00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:27.592]  So, it's just unbelievable.
[00:26:27.772 --> 00:26:34.815]  And, you know, the attitude by basketball team owners and stuff, about 3 million people in death camps, hundreds of thousands being killed every few months, they confirm.
[00:26:35.356 --> 00:26:36.336]  But, like, I don't even care.
[00:26:36.376 --> 00:26:38.417]  The Uyghurs don't even register to me.
[00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:40.738]  I'm a liberal, the guy says.
[00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:51.964]  So, I give $10 million to Black Lives Matter, and so I've bought my ticket to be able to engage and support genocide.
[00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:56.239]  Because basketball is even bigger in China than it is here.
[00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:57.940]  They make most of their money in China now.
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:03.523]  And this guy is literally banking and working and getting products made by people in death camps.
[00:27:03.863 --> 00:27:05.684]  And then he says, screw them.
[00:27:05.704 --> 00:27:06.784]  I don't even think about them.
[00:27:06.824 --> 00:27:07.925]  They don't even enter my mind.
[00:27:08.485 --> 00:27:09.645]  I'm trying to get this through to everybody.
[00:27:10.146 --> 00:27:12.407]  That's who we're up against and they've converted.
[00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.572]  Most of the Democratic Party voters are like that now.
[00:27:15.993 --> 00:27:17.614]  The judges, most of them are like that.
[00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:20.857]  The pundits on TV, they know they're evil.
[00:27:21.298 --> 00:27:22.399]  They know they're bad.
[00:27:22.619 --> 00:27:24.040]  They know they're taking our speech.
[00:27:24.381 --> 00:27:28.825]  They know they're preparing to criminalize being a nationalist or a patriot.
[00:27:29.826 --> 00:27:31.427]  And it's the same program worldwide.
[00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:34.230]  So, this is it.
[00:27:34.289 --> 00:27:41.289]  It's not coming, it's here.
[00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:46.990]   And they are searing our conscience right now when they have the owners of basketball teams
[00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.589]  saying millions in death camps doesn't even register.
[00:27:50.691 --> 00:27:53.676]  They don't even make it on my radar screen, he said.
[00:27:54.943 --> 00:28:00.368]  Now let me ask you, do you feel safe when hundreds of millions of people are getting set to die from starvation?
[00:28:00.948 --> 00:28:04.271]  Already 40 plus million in the last two years, that's a low number, extra died.
[00:28:04.572 --> 00:28:06.053]  That's 40 freaking million people.
[00:28:06.313 --> 00:28:11.718]  Because I'm going to just say, do you feel safe with an elite running things that on purpose just did that?
[00:28:11.838 --> 00:28:13.420]  Because maybe you think there's too many Africans.
[00:28:16.414 --> 00:28:19.695]  Maybe you're a eugenicist, but I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:23.555]  Do you think you're safe when that type of stuff's going on?
[00:28:23.695 --> 00:28:25.256]  Because I'll assure you, nobody is.
[00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:27.076]  I don't care if you're a billionaire.
[00:28:27.356 --> 00:28:29.056]  I don't care if you work at a shoe store.
[00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:30.037]  This isn't good.
[00:28:30.097 --> 00:28:31.097]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:41.479]  I'll get into Biden and I'll get into all the things that are unfolding coming up next segment.
[00:28:41.499 --> 00:28:42.419]  Then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:28:44.116 --> 00:28:48.257]  In the second and third hour, Roger Stone will be popping in some of the third hour as well.
[00:28:50.678 --> 00:28:56.020]  And I want to get into the New World Order and the starvation and what it really means.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.741]  I'm already kind of getting into it, but I want to spend the next segment, the longest segment of the hour on that.
[00:29:00.862 --> 00:29:08.044]  I want to cover a few things concerning Infowars and independent media and how this ties into the bigger picture we're looking at here.
[00:29:09.318 --> 00:29:11.499]  And respond to the big national news story.
[00:29:11.979 --> 00:29:22.924]  Basically, thousands of local TV stations ran the story, national news all ran it, from ABC News to CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, local newspaper.
[00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:26.566]  Alex Jones could be arrested for not going to deposition.
[00:29:31.383 --> 00:29:34.424]  And then they're, oh, he's faking an illness, he's lying.
[00:29:35.025 --> 00:29:40.727]  Ladies and gentlemen, I said yesterday in something I recorded from home that they'd changed the deposition times on us five times.
[00:29:41.208 --> 00:29:43.609]  It was more like eight times they did it last minute.
[00:29:44.069 --> 00:29:47.310]  We didn't go to the judge, we didn't complain, because it's just what they do.
[00:29:47.951 --> 00:29:49.631]  And then I had a mystery illness.
[00:29:50.152 --> 00:29:51.352]  We couldn't figure out what it was.
[00:29:51.412 --> 00:29:52.653]  I finally found out last night.
[00:29:53.713 --> 00:29:54.854]  And it wasn't what people thought.
[00:29:56.835 --> 00:29:59.705]   And The doctors are like, hey, your health comes first.
[00:29:59.725 --> 00:30:00.625]  Go do these tests.
[00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.748]  And I found out about it on Monday.
[00:30:02.788 --> 00:30:03.408]  Wasn't sure.
[00:30:03.428 --> 00:30:05.010]  Got a little worse on Tuesday.
[00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.412]  Went ahead and said, OK, I'm going to go get these tests.
[00:30:07.451 --> 00:30:14.290]   and I went and got scans and the, what do you call them, they put the electrodes all over you, the EKGs,
[00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.711]  and 16 ampules of blood taken.
[00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:22.971]   Went to a couple clinics, places, got checked in, got some more tests coming up next week,
[00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:25.612]  and then boom, one of the doctors finally figured it out.
[00:30:25.612 --> 00:30:28.790]  They go, "You're not dizzy because of high blood pressure,"
[00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.592]  which I don't have.
[00:30:30.592 --> 00:30:31.571]  "It's not your heart.
[00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:36.131]   "Your heart's actually in really good shape "for somebody overweight like you at your age."
[00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:39.891]   They said the right side of my heart's a little bit bigger than the other side, but that's classic
[00:30:39.891 --> 00:30:42.851]  when somebody with sleep apnea, but it's not that enlarged.
[00:30:41.961 --> 00:30:42.821]  It's a little bit on one side.
[00:30:43.062 --> 00:30:45.223]  Don't let you know my medical stuff here, and I've got charts and all that said.
[00:30:45.243 --> 00:30:48.584]  But they said it's a really good heart for even a normal 48-year-old person.
[00:30:48.665 --> 00:30:51.366]  It looks like a 20-year-old's, but it's a little bit bigger on this side.
[00:30:51.386 --> 00:30:56.429]  Yeah, that's the sleep apnea, because they asked me in the questionnaire and then even predicted that my right side would be a little bit bigger.
[00:30:58.814 --> 00:31:01.155]  They're like, hey, have you taken some Claritin D?
[00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:01.456]  Have you?
[00:31:02.116 --> 00:31:08.520]  And then they like sort of checking, sent me to another doctor and I had a blockage in my sinus.
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:20.067]  And when it finally came out last night, blood and pus and oh, I felt so much better because Marbles in here on Monday and I'm dizzy and I'm sweating.
[00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:22.268]  And I say, yeah, I've been dizzy for a couple of days.
[00:31:22.328 --> 00:31:23.068]  It comes and goes.
[00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:27.431]  He goes, well, you're that could be your heart and you need to, you know, you need to go to the doctor right now.
[00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.972]  And then he was predicting, you know, well, you're kind of a little bit overweight, you're stressed.
[00:31:31.012 --> 00:31:32.653]  I bet you need a stint in your heart and all that stuff.
[00:31:32.673 --> 00:31:35.114]  He's a great guy, but I was like, whoa, you really?
[00:31:35.134 --> 00:31:36.713]  And so I was dizzy.
[00:31:36.713 --> 00:31:40.614]  You probably noticed last week I was sniffling a lot.
[00:31:40.614 --> 00:31:43.153]  Every time I go to LA stuff like this happens.
[00:31:43.153 --> 00:31:47.653]   I went to LA, I was there, stopped up the whole time, couldn't figure it out what was going on,
[00:31:47.653 --> 00:31:51.713]   got a neti pot, tried that, and then it just made a middle ear type deal
[00:31:51.713 --> 00:31:56.333]   where I was just like, whoa, half the day, like I was on the deck of a ship,
[00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:57.933]  and he thought that was my heart.
[00:31:57.933 --> 00:31:59.933]  So that's what happened.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.821]  That's what's going on.
[00:32:01.081 --> 00:32:03.844]  And I feel like a new person wants this blockage.
[00:32:03.864 --> 00:32:06.467]  I don't want to get graphic here, but you know, it was disgusting.
[00:32:06.507 --> 00:32:07.868]  Blood, pus.
[00:32:07.928 --> 00:32:12.152]  I mean, we're talking to probably three ounces of it came out of my left nostril.
[00:32:12.653 --> 00:32:14.014]  And so that's the big story.
[00:32:14.074 --> 00:32:14.795]  That's what happened.
[00:32:14.895 --> 00:32:16.837]  And of course, they're like, you're dizzy.
[00:32:16.877 --> 00:32:17.558]  You're sweating.
[00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.040]  You can't go to this.
[00:32:20.436 --> 00:32:22.116]  I've sat for three of these things.
[00:32:22.296 --> 00:32:25.137]  I've been basically anally probed by these people.
[00:32:25.157 --> 00:32:26.137]  They've gotten everything.
[00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.658]  A blueprint to try to destroy us.
[00:32:27.718 --> 00:32:28.638]  They admit that's their plan.
[00:32:29.398 --> 00:32:31.839]  And then they default us and say we've done nothing.
[00:32:31.919 --> 00:32:35.640]  And then I have a medical issue and tell them and they say they want me arrested.
[00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.400]  That's who these people are.
[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:45.902]  It's a Democratic Party mafia that uses dead children as their pretext to attack the Second and First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:46.482 --> 00:32:48.603]  And it is preposterous.
[00:32:49.543 --> 00:32:51.004]  Absolutely preposterous.
[00:32:51.865 --> 00:32:53.646]  But I'm glad I went and got these medical tests.
[00:32:53.906 --> 00:32:56.969]  And if you want to get completely graphic, everybody asks why I have gravelly voice.
[00:32:57.329 --> 00:32:59.110]  I scream and yell a lot on bullhorns over the years.
[00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.311]  Didn't have voice lessons.
[00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:01.592]  Tore up my throat.
[00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:09.578]  And I've got some polyps on my larynx and another one not on the larynx up here that I'm going to have to get surgery on at some point.
[00:33:09.858 --> 00:33:12.240]  But I won't be able to be on air for two weeks when I do it.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.561]  So I got that to deal with.
[00:33:14.621 --> 00:33:17.904]  I mean, since we're all obsessed with my medical stuff, let's just get it all out there.
[00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:31.736]  Don't have any hemorrhoids, don't have any hangnails, got 60 beats per minute, I've got the blood pressure of a 25-year-old, and so I got good genetics.
[00:33:35.097 --> 00:33:39.118]  I'm on antibiotics and feeling a lot better with this whole nasal situation.
[00:33:39.818 --> 00:33:40.699]  So there we are.
[00:33:40.999 --> 00:33:41.679]  That's where we're at.
[00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:43.780]  And so I'm done talking about it.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:59.085]  But man, the response of those people and the craziness and how they've weaponized the judiciary and how I'm supposed to be destroyed and the people involved, the judges, the lawyers, all of them are primping for the media and writing books and making money and getting off on it.
[00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:00.045]  And it's just disgusting.
[00:34:00.265 --> 00:34:02.506]  And then accusing me of living off those dead kids?
[00:34:03.046 --> 00:34:03.166]  No!
[00:34:03.866 --> 00:34:07.008]  It's that whole group of Democrats and lawyers and people they live off of them.
[00:34:07.448 --> 00:34:09.829]  Folks up in Connecticut run like a cult around those kids.
[00:34:10.089 --> 00:34:10.610]  We'll be right back.
[00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.471]  Back in the saddle.
[00:34:13.431 --> 00:34:17.973]  Broadcasting worldwide on this Friday, March 25th.
[00:34:18.173 --> 00:34:18.794]  2022 transmission.
[00:34:18.914 --> 00:34:20.715]  One other big show note here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:22.068 --> 00:34:26.653]  I almost always, when I say I'm doing a special live broadcast, I almost always end up doing it.
[00:34:27.754 --> 00:34:36.122]  But obviously because of the vertigo and the rest of it from the sinus infection, I didn't do that Wednesday as I said I would, and I apologize for that, or Tuesday.
[00:34:37.063 --> 00:35:01.384]   But I will do a three hour live show, excuse me, I will do a three hour live Show tomorrow commercial free by that we're not gonna go to regular breaks like a radio or TV clock We'll play a few breaks for me to go to the bathroom or you know get up get a cup of coffee or whatever But we're gonna do a three-hour special show live from 1 p.m.
[00:35:01.564 --> 00:35:02.465]  To 4 p.m.
[00:35:02.945 --> 00:35:17.738]   Tomorrow we're gonna have a surprise special guest as well And we're gonna take your calls And I'm also going to take your calls Next hour and in the third hour as well, and we have Roger Stone on the big suit that Trump has filed.
[00:35:18.919 --> 00:35:27.446]  It's really a blueprint of how the Democrats engaged in their attempted coup against Trump and the American people and their whole Russiagate fraud, and how the scam worked.
[00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:34.912]  Very important to understand and know, even if Democrat judges are probably going to throw the very, very well-done, well-documented suit out.
[00:35:35.412 --> 00:35:38.195]  So we'll be looking at that with Roger Stone some in the third hour.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.721]  I will give the number out here in just a few minutes.
[00:35:41.741 --> 00:35:52.527]  We'll fire up the phone system so everybody can call in and give us your take on all of these different situations that are unfolding.
[00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:54.488]  Let me get back to this now.
[00:35:57.169 --> 00:36:06.554]  The crime against humanity, the mass murder on a scale of which the world has never seen in recorded history.
[00:36:08.194 --> 00:36:11.616]  Has been taking place for two years with the whole COVID mafia takeover.
[00:36:12.277 --> 00:36:13.878]  With the deadly virus they released.
[00:36:14.579 --> 00:36:16.100]  Blocking the drugs to treat the virus.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.000]  It's very easy to treat.
[00:36:17.801 --> 00:36:18.381]  Therapeutics.
[00:36:19.022 --> 00:36:31.611]  Then giving people the vaccines that's not a vaccine that actually creates the same thing as a spike protein and colonizes your body with protein crystals very similar to what causes mad cow disease or spongiform encephalopathy.
[00:36:32.847 --> 00:36:40.192]  The denial of care of old people who needed cancer surgery, heart surgery, and others that died by the millions worldwide.
[00:36:40.452 --> 00:36:40.973]  It's estimated.
[00:36:41.013 --> 00:36:42.013]  I've got the articles right here.
[00:36:42.314 --> 00:36:43.234]  We'll cover it next hour.
[00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:51.260]  The giving old people a host of assisted suicide drugs when they were on ventilators, knowing it kills you when you do that.
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.602]  I mean, I have the New York Times admitting this here.
[00:36:54.442 --> 00:36:55.303]  And they're still doing it.
[00:36:57.864 --> 00:37:00.987]  That's who these people are!
[00:37:01.167 --> 00:37:16.122]  They are normalizing, culling off the population, the great culling, that Dr. Rima Labo and General Stubblebine were told about 14 years ago, when she treated heads of state.
[00:37:17.504 --> 00:37:18.825]  He was the former head of the Army.
[00:37:19.466 --> 00:37:20.647]  He had his connections as well.
[00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:27.585]  And what did she say in that Jesse Ventura interview with myself and Jesse Ventura on his show?
[00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.366]  Everything that now happened.
[00:37:31.768 --> 00:37:36.351]  And so we're not late to the game here.
[00:37:36.391 --> 00:37:37.312]  We know what's going on.
[00:37:37.372 --> 00:37:38.213]  You know what's going on.
[00:37:38.293 --> 00:37:44.757]  And everybody better come face to face with the global controlled collapse that's now begun.
[00:37:44.838 --> 00:37:54.768]   So when Biden says new world order and 60 million dead, he means World War II when he's bumbling, And that we didn't have that anymore on the same scale because of the liberal world order.
[00:37:55.269 --> 00:37:58.530]  No, they just had Pol Pot and other people do it quietly, the killing.
[00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.111]  Fidel Castro and countless other dictators.
[00:38:03.932 --> 00:38:09.474]  And that now that's all over, but that America will lead the new, new world order.
[00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:16.157]  The end of Bretton Woods, a new global currency based on carbon taxes.
[00:38:17.239 --> 00:38:20.240]  And based on a global social credit score, build back better.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.081]  You will have nothing.
[00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:21.741]  You will own nothing.
[00:38:21.761 --> 00:38:22.221]  You'll like it.
[00:38:22.462 --> 00:38:23.322]  You will eat bugs.
[00:38:23.982 --> 00:38:25.123]  They announced it five years ago.
[00:38:25.183 --> 00:38:25.883]  You laugh at it.
[00:38:26.003 --> 00:38:26.563]  I laugh at it.
[00:38:26.924 --> 00:38:29.825]  Now, fancy restaurants only to serve bugs.
[00:38:32.926 --> 00:38:33.887]  You're like, well, that's crazy.
[00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:35.388]  Well, it's getting to the children's brains.
[00:38:35.708 --> 00:38:36.968]  They're the real ones being brainwashed.
[00:38:37.269 --> 00:38:40.090]  It's a very anti-human takeover taking place.
[00:38:42.017 --> 00:38:46.219]  And so, there's the headline, bug munching soon to be mainstream in Austin.
[00:38:46.279 --> 00:38:47.219]  They're never going to stop.
[00:38:47.259 --> 00:38:50.721]  And they'll be subsidized by banks with free drinks and free everything.
[00:38:50.801 --> 00:38:52.121]  Just eat the bugs.
[00:38:52.182 --> 00:38:52.782]  Be trendy.
[00:38:53.082 --> 00:38:54.623]  Just teach pedophilia to children.
[00:38:55.723 --> 00:38:57.504]  Just drink your GMO garbage.
[00:38:57.544 --> 00:39:02.206]  Drink your aspartame in your Coca-Colas and other drinks in your gums.
[00:39:02.906 --> 00:39:05.727]  And oh, drink your atrazine in the water.
[00:39:06.847 --> 00:39:09.047]  All of it is an attack plan.
[00:39:09.047 --> 00:39:17.567]   So let's go ahead now and go to Biden talking about the new world order
[00:39:17.567 --> 00:39:18.527]  and why this is so important.
[00:39:19.536 --> 00:39:23.578]  You know, we are an inflection point, I believe, in the world economy.
[00:39:23.598 --> 00:39:25.779]  Not just the world economy, in the world.
[00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:28.460]  It occurs every three or four generations.
[00:39:29.461 --> 00:39:38.005]  As one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.
[00:39:40.938 --> 00:39:47.137]   And since then we've established a liberal world order and that hadn't happened in a long while.
[00:39:47.137 --> 00:39:49.938]  A lot of people dying but nowhere near the chaos.
[00:39:49.938 --> 00:39:52.438]  And now's the time when things are shifting.
[00:39:52.438 --> 00:39:54.938]  There's going to be a new world order out there.
[00:39:54.938 --> 00:39:56.438]  And we've got to lead it.
[00:39:56.438 --> 00:39:59.438]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[00:39:59.438 --> 00:40:00.438]  So anyway.
[00:40:00.438 --> 00:40:03.438]  So anyway.
[00:40:03.438 --> 00:40:06.938]  A true death sentence.
[00:40:07.022 --> 00:40:07.522]  Breaking.
[00:40:08.042 --> 00:40:10.823]  Biden warns of incoming food shortages.
[00:40:11.664 --> 00:40:13.064]  It's gonna be real.
[00:40:15.545 --> 00:40:16.366]  Yahoo Finance.
[00:40:16.426 --> 00:40:20.707]  Biden says to expect real food shortages due to Ukraine war.
[00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:25.129]  And yeah, that's gonna cause some wheat shortages and things, which is a death sentence to Africa.
[00:40:25.149 --> 00:40:26.110]  That's the main place it's gonna hit.
[00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:31.892]  But when you expand on that, what else is going on, you see?
[00:40:33.452 --> 00:40:40.742]  of the devaluation of the currencies that have taken place.
[00:40:40.742 --> 00:40:50.253]   And then we have again these insane type of statements.
[00:40:48.383 --> 00:40:52.065]  ABC journalist unhappy that Biden was too quick to rule out World War III.
[00:40:52.705 --> 00:40:55.607]  This is when you get such domesticated, dumbed down people.
[00:40:56.408 --> 00:41:00.350]  They have no idea how anything works.
[00:41:01.071 --> 00:41:11.774]   That's why they tell you, oh, Well, we're just going to get our electricity from power plants that don't have any carbon in it.
[00:41:13.175 --> 00:41:14.035]  And they don't even care.
[00:41:16.436 --> 00:41:26.381]  They don't even know that it takes more carbon to charge up an electric car than gasoline creates, which is, I think we should create more carbon.
[00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.243]  I'm all for electric cars if you realize it's coming from coal mainly and natural gas.
[00:41:32.028 --> 00:41:33.949]  Windmills can't power 5% of the country.
[00:41:34.249 --> 00:41:35.890]  Spain is bankrupt now because they tried it.
[00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:36.770]  It doesn't work!
[00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:38.051]  And they know it doesn't work!
[00:41:38.111 --> 00:41:39.752]  It's meant to collapse society!
[00:41:41.713 --> 00:41:50.917]  I've got mainstream articles here out of the New York Times, CNN, and MSNBC, saying working out is bad.
[00:41:52.136 --> 00:41:54.297]  And it's racist and it's what white people do.
[00:41:54.597 --> 00:42:04.140]  And they say because it's empowering and teaches you that you're strong and have brotherhood and sisterhood and you meet a community of people that they don't politically control.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.280]  Because this is a gym.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.721]  Gyms can be liberal, they can be conservative, they can be neutral.
[00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:09.942]  It's not LGBT pedophile.
[00:42:10.482 --> 00:42:11.663]  It's not black, it's not white.
[00:42:11.703 --> 00:42:13.683]  It's a place where people come together and are friends.
[00:42:14.263 --> 00:42:17.124]  And so, oh my God, they want those restricted.
[00:42:17.164 --> 00:42:18.445]  I've got that article.
[00:42:19.673 --> 00:42:21.975]  Here in my stack.
[00:42:22.555 --> 00:42:24.017]  How it's the new evil thing.
[00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:25.238]  It's the new bad thing.
[00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:27.540]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.024]  MSNBC piece claims health and fitness is the new gateway drug to the far right.
[00:42:33.104 --> 00:42:35.746]  Yes, being competent, being successful, being happy.
[00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:38.088]  What did the leaked Facebook documents show?
[00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.890]  Four years ago?
[00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:43.513]  We want them depressed and alone and only talking to avatars.
[00:42:44.614 --> 00:42:47.156]  Pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme.
[00:42:47.536 --> 00:42:48.257]  Oh, yes.
[00:42:49.361 --> 00:42:51.382]  Everything's bad that empowers you.
[00:42:52.442 --> 00:42:53.062]  It's all white.
[00:42:53.082 --> 00:42:57.403]  They're now saying science and math and reading and writing is white.
[00:42:57.743 --> 00:42:58.643]  So we don't want it.
[00:42:59.984 --> 00:43:02.284]  It's the sabotage of civilization.
[00:43:02.304 --> 00:43:04.865]  We're going to go on a break and come back with all of this and more.
[00:43:04.945 --> 00:43:09.546]  I just want to remind listeners that we can't operate and stay on air without your support.
[00:43:10.306 --> 00:43:14.167]  And we've got to have a clearance of the t-shirts and some of the books and films that are incredible.

[00:43:24.132 --> 00:43:25.774]  I am determined to not lay people off.
[00:43:26.115 --> 00:43:28.698]  I am determined to keep fighting these globalists and everything they're doing.
[00:43:28.718 --> 00:43:29.619]  But I need your support.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.561]  Thanks for all your support.
[00:43:30.801 --> 00:43:35.007]  But all your investment previous now needs this to carry everybody to the next level.
[00:43:35.327 --> 00:43:37.128]  We cannot let InfoWars falter the waiver.

[00:44:28.242 --> 00:44:50.842]  and Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:53.731]  And that is because the economy is breaking down.
[00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:54.872]  Inflation is exploding.
[00:44:55.172 --> 00:44:56.693]  The supply chains have broken down.
[00:44:57.414 --> 00:45:02.439]  And InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[00:45:02.499 --> 00:45:07.583]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[00:45:07.864 --> 00:45:10.946]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[00:45:11.027 --> 00:45:13.449]  It's reaching more people than ever, despite the censorship.
[00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:21.315]  But, because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:32.963]  So listen, up to 75% off at InfoWarsTour.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films.

[00:45:39.868 --> 00:45:40.769]  Thank you for your support.
[00:45:41.801 --> 00:45:51.466]  As one of the top military people said to me in a secure meeting the other day, 60 million people died between 1900 and 1946.
[00:45:51.526 --> 00:45:59.429]  And since then, we've established a liberal world order, and that hadn't happened in a long while.
[00:45:59.449 --> 00:46:01.931]  A lot of people died, but nowhere near the chaos.
[00:46:02.611 --> 00:46:04.552]  And now's the time when things are shifting.
[00:46:04.572 --> 00:46:07.073]  There's going to be a new world order out there.
[00:46:07.657 --> 00:46:08.637]  We've got to lead it.
[00:46:09.017 --> 00:46:11.498]  We've got to unite the rest of the free world in doing it.
[00:46:11.838 --> 00:46:12.118]  So anyway.
[00:46:12.138 --> 00:46:13.419]  What did you say?
[00:46:13.239 --> 00:46:22.239]   *incoherent mumbling* *maniacal laughter*
[00:46:22.239 --> 00:46:27.239]   *music* *beep*
[00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:35.007]   *silence* Love all the folks with the memes, keeping the love out
[00:46:35.007 --> 00:46:36.239]  there, keeping InfoWars alive.
[00:46:36.383 --> 00:46:37.464]  We really appreciate everybody.
[00:46:38.384 --> 00:46:56.015]  We really appreciate, we got this Croatian leader, getting in Trudeau's face when he traveled to the European Union, and also Christina Anderson, who, wow, is just an amazing, I guess, German member of the European Union Parliament, who just keeps kicking ass.
[00:46:57.116 --> 00:47:02.927]   This is a little dictator, Dear colleagues, dear citizens, Prime Minister Trudeau.
[00:47:02.867 --> 00:47:09.867]  confronted.
[00:47:09.867 --> 00:47:16.867]   Dear citizens, Prime Minister Trudeau, freedom, the right to vote, the right to life and health,
[00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:25.867]   the right to work, for many of us, these are fundamental human rights for which millions
[00:47:25.867 --> 00:47:29.867]   of citizens of Europe and the world have dedicated their lives.
[00:47:29.867 --> 00:47:36.867]   For the defense of our rights, the rights of our children, which we have fought for centuries.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:38.862]  We fought for centuries for.
[00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:40.303]  Because he's willing to risk.
[00:47:40.883 --> 00:47:43.966]  His freedom and his lives to fight it.
[00:47:43.986 --> 00:47:47.028]  But today people aren't willing to fight.
[00:47:46.888 --> 00:47:57.888]   it. But today people aren't willing to fight. I'm just paraphrasing.
[00:47:57.888 --> 00:48:07.888]   Canada, once a symbol of modern world, has become a symbol of civil rights violations
[00:48:07.888 --> 00:48:10.388]  under your quasi-liberal boot in recent months.
[00:48:10.255 --> 00:48:23.454]   We watched how you trample women with horses, how you block the bank accounts of single
[00:48:23.454 --> 00:48:30.535]   parents so that they can't even pay for their children's education and medicine, so they
[00:48:30.535 --> 00:48:36.175]  can't pay utilities, mortgages for their homes.
[00:48:36.214 --> 00:48:41.916]  For you, these may be liberal methods.
[00:48:43.057 --> 00:48:45.037]  For many citizens of the world, it's called a dictatorship.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.700]  of the worst kind.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:55.800]   Rest assured that the citizens of the world, united, can stop any regime that wants to
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:08.020]  destroy the freedom of the citizens.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.080]  And then here's what she had to say.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:17.920]  Mr. Trudeau, you are a disgrace for any democracy.
[00:49:17.942 --> 00:49:20.444]  Please spare us your presence.
[00:49:20.464 --> 00:49:24.066]  I'm Christina Anderson.
[00:49:24.086 --> 00:49:25.126]  I'm a member of Radio Listeners.
[00:49:25.367 --> 00:49:26.567]  I'm there ready for Radio Listeners.
[00:49:27.488 --> 00:49:29.729]  We're a TV program as well, but I'm there ready for Radio Listeners.
[00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.431]  I will now give the floor to Ms.
[00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:34.192]  Christine Anderson for her point.
[00:49:36.874 --> 00:49:37.234]  Thank you.
[00:49:37.254 --> 00:49:38.555]  Based on Article 195...
[00:49:40.523 --> 00:49:59.722]  I doubt that it would have been more appropriate for Mr. Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, to address this house according to Article 144, an article which was specifically designed to debate violations of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, which is clearly the case with Mr. Trudeau.
[00:50:00.282 --> 00:50:20.270]  Then again, a prime minister who openly admires the Chinese basic dictatorship, who tramples on fundamental rights by persecuting and criminalizing his own citizens as terrorists, just because they dared to stand up to his perverted concept of democracy, should not be allowed to speak in this house at all.
[00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:24.812]  Mr. Trudeau, you are a disgrace for any democracy.
[00:50:25.132 --> 00:50:27.633]  Please spare us your presence.
[00:50:27.733 --> 00:50:28.053]  Thank you.
[00:50:29.448 --> 00:50:29.768]  Powerful.
[00:50:29.808 --> 00:50:30.268]  We'll be back.
[00:50:30.288 --> 00:50:31.669]  Give the number out and take your calls.
[00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:38.452]  So, Puppet Biden is tramsing around Europe, looking lost and confused.
[00:50:39.813 --> 00:50:48.757]  But he takes time out from his busy day trying to start World War Theory to admit that, oh, this is causing global food shortages.
[00:50:48.857 --> 00:50:50.138]  Of course, he blames it all on Russia.
[00:50:50.298 --> 00:50:53.779]  Russia's just the cherry on top right now, but it is exacerbating it.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:06.921]   And the massive sanctions on Russia, whose supplies A large portion of the oil and gas to the world and fertilizer is crippling the situation and supercharging
[00:51:08.484 --> 00:51:10.025]  Already exploding inflation.
[00:51:10.445 --> 00:51:19.451]  And now that big banks and oil companies have an excuse to blame all the inflation on Russia, they're allowing it to accelerate even worse.
[00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:24.574]  It really is an incredible time to be alive here.
[00:51:24.594 --> 00:51:30.353]   and I wanted to talk about this in a moment because the federal government's
[00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:35.474]   doing everything it can to block natural gas use in the United States. In fact, I
[00:51:35.474 --> 00:51:39.793]   can get clips of Biden saying we're gonna end up outlawing natural gas even
[00:51:39.793 --> 00:51:43.472]   though it's totally clean. First it's coal, then it's natural gas and trying to
[00:51:43.472 --> 00:51:47.394]   block natural gas drilling permits and new pipeline permits and blocking the
[00:51:47.394 --> 00:51:52.874]   Keystone Pipeline that brings both oil and gas through its systems. So he's
[00:51:52.874 --> 00:52:00.114]   publicly holding us underwater while we drowned and then talking about how much
[00:52:00.114 --> 00:52:11.193]   he wants to give us a life preserver. So today's live show headline really says it all.
[00:52:10.774 --> 00:52:11.574]  Great reset.
[00:52:12.075 --> 00:52:16.979]  President Biden heralds food shortages as next step of a globalist power grab.
[00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:18.460]  And I played that clip last hour.
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:25.826]  He said this will teach us to tighten our belts and to lower our carbon footprint and to cut our use of fossil fuels.
[00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:31.353]  Oh, but it's all the Russians' fault.
[00:52:31.393 --> 00:52:37.136]  Boy, I sure wish it was their fault, because they'd be easy to deal with, except we have the globalists ruling us right here at home.
[00:52:37.176 --> 00:52:37.956]  And here's the headline.
[00:52:38.697 --> 00:52:39.797]  EU signs U.S.
[00:52:39.837 --> 00:52:42.018]  gas deal to curb reliance on Russia.
[00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:42.839]  The U.S.
[00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:52.103]  will only supply 10% of what Russia does, so that won't help them with their electricity, and with cooking their food, and with heating their homes, everything else they do.
[00:52:54.673 --> 00:52:55.694]  But now the U.S.
[00:52:55.714 --> 00:53:01.358]  that's been running low on gas because of all the sanctions Biden has put on us with these regulations.
[00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:11.746]  I mean, that's what it is, not giving out new permits and shutting down thousands of gas spurs, or ordering gas companies to go dig up their gas pipelines and update them.
[00:53:12.647 --> 00:53:16.209]  We've got a ranch in East Texas that's got a gas pipeline that they updated in the 80s.
[00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.232]  Supposedly got a 60-year service, hadn't had any leaks, hadn't had any problems.
[00:53:20.473 --> 00:53:21.153]  It's not our gas.
[00:53:21.193 --> 00:53:21.774]  We don't get the money.
[00:53:22.474 --> 00:53:23.115]  It's a right-of-way.
[00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:26.551]  And they're out there putting in a new deal.
[00:53:26.571 --> 00:53:31.713]  We were talking to the guy a few weeks ago when I was out there visiting family, and he's like, yeah, it's just Biden's regulations.
[00:53:31.733 --> 00:53:34.214]  We got to pull up all this gas pipeline and put a new one in.
[00:53:36.514 --> 00:53:37.795]  Imagine that cost.
[00:53:37.815 --> 00:53:39.676]  Well, that's all passed on to you folks.
[00:53:40.136 --> 00:53:43.017]  Over 2,000 gas spurs shut down in pipelines.
[00:53:43.277 --> 00:53:44.737]  The Keystone Pipeline shut down.
[00:53:45.018 --> 00:53:47.138]  And you wonder why you're paying more for electricity.
[00:53:47.158 --> 00:53:51.660]  Because they've cut the coal power plants almost completely off.
[00:53:53.004 --> 00:54:03.109]  And now they're not getting enough gas to feed the power plants, and now they've cut off the Russian gas, and so now they're going to take our gas and give it to the Europeans.
[00:54:05.911 --> 00:54:07.312]  Yet, of course, jacked up prices.
[00:54:08.572 --> 00:54:10.053]  Artificial scarcity.
[00:54:12.154 --> 00:54:14.696]  And of course, we really shouldn't even complain.
[00:54:14.736 --> 00:54:18.818]  We're dumb enough to let these criminals steal elections and do this, and at least you're not in Africa.
[00:54:20.558 --> 00:54:33.101]  Because the UN, and I actually agree with their numbers because I've done my own research on it, is estimating 200 extra million people are going to starve to death the next two years because of inflation and because of this war.
[00:54:33.121 --> 00:54:40.163]  Because Africa gets about half its grain from Ukraine.
[00:54:41.223 --> 00:54:43.103]  You go, why don't the Africans just eat something else?
[00:54:44.163 --> 00:54:46.404]  That's one of the only high-calorie things they can get cheap.
[00:54:49.093 --> 00:54:52.215]  And then they work in factories and farms, growing stuff for us.
[00:54:52.955 --> 00:54:56.378]  But they can't grow grain in most areas of Africa, they can grow everything else.
[00:54:56.838 --> 00:54:58.959]  How dare those Africans want bread!
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.302]  But see, you won't hear a liberal say a word about that, because they're not supposed to.
[00:55:04.663 --> 00:55:12.908]  They just wrap themselves in that they're liberal, and they love black people, and the corporate spokespersons are all black, basically.
[00:55:13.248 --> 00:55:14.389]  Every corporate spokesperson.
[00:55:14.409 --> 00:55:16.230]  Of course, the companies aren't owned by black people.
[00:55:17.546 --> 00:55:21.411]  It's so evil, the new world order wearing blackface.
[00:55:23.334 --> 00:55:31.524]  Here is Biden talking about how very real the pain's going to be, how we're all under sanctions to hurt Russia, then I've got some inflation news.
[00:55:32.521 --> 00:55:33.482]  Nothing more to report.
[00:55:34.003 --> 00:55:38.267]  With regard to food shortages, yes we did talk about food shortages.
[00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:40.970]  And it's going to be real.
[00:55:41.691 --> 00:55:45.756]  The price of these sanctions is not just imposed upon Russia.
[00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:52.103]  It's imposed upon an awful lot of countries as well, including European countries and our country as well.
[00:55:53.732 --> 00:55:55.353]  Where it really is is poor people.
[00:55:55.433 --> 00:56:03.460]  You see, folks in Africa and most people in Latin America and the Middle East and most areas of Asia pay about 40% of their paycheck for food.
[00:56:04.421 --> 00:56:05.082]  In the U.S.
[00:56:05.142 --> 00:56:07.684]  and other industrialized countries, it's less than 20%.
[00:56:08.244 --> 00:56:09.485]  And they have graphs on this.
[00:56:09.525 --> 00:56:18.153]  They know that once food cost goes up to 50%, starvation, revolution, and war start.
[00:56:19.941 --> 00:56:25.903]  And about six months ago, almost every third world country in the world is now spending more than half its money on food.
[00:56:28.404 --> 00:56:29.765]  And the graph's the worst it's ever been.
[00:56:29.965 --> 00:56:30.645]  It's going straight up.
[00:56:30.965 --> 00:56:33.126]  So it hasn't just gone above the 50% mark.
[00:56:33.786 --> 00:56:40.029]  In many areas, people are spending 60 plus percent of their income, that might just be a few dollars a day, on food.
[00:56:41.749 --> 00:56:43.250]  And then those countries are going to collapse.
[00:56:44.304 --> 00:56:51.951]  And masses are going to starve to death, and then those that survive, tough, strong military-age men that can make the trek while the women and children starve?
[00:56:52.992 --> 00:57:03.542]  They're going to come up here and be indoctrinated by the UN at UN facilities, refugee camps for up to six months, and then brought in to be the new globalist permanent underclass.
[00:57:04.142 --> 00:57:05.043]  And then we're in checkmate.
[00:57:05.443 --> 00:57:06.844]  It's called replacement migration.
[00:57:07.205 --> 00:57:19.551]   That's why if you talk about it, even though it's on the UN website and it's their plan, They will come after you so quick, because that's a key linchpin, the globalist in documents that Judicial Watch got 15 years ago, and Lou Dobbs covered.
[00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:20.492]  Did I put my film in-game?
[00:57:24.154 --> 00:57:33.560]  They explained, we're going to use a virus to take over, and we're going to use the collapse of the third world to flood the first world and take over, and then we're going to bring in a cashless society on the backs of that.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.041]  And that's in my film in-game.
[00:57:36.302 --> 00:57:37.703]  Made almost 15 years ago, 2017.
[00:57:37.743 --> 00:57:37.883]  Made 2007.
[00:57:42.139 --> 00:57:44.340]  So, think about that.
[00:57:45.821 --> 00:58:00.631]  So yeah, they're going to kill the Africans, kill the Latin Americans, kill the Muslims in the Middle East, all of them, and then those that survive are going to flood us and be brainwashed to be anti-Christian, anti-white by the rich billionaire white people that are actually eugenicists playing us all off against each other.
[00:58:04.477 --> 00:58:05.397]  EU signs U.S.
[00:58:05.417 --> 00:58:06.758]  gas deal to curb reliance.
[00:58:06.938 --> 00:58:07.758]  And then you've got this.
[00:58:07.958 --> 00:58:12.100]  Majority of voters blame Joe Biden's policies for inflation.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.140]  But he's just a puppet.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.280]  How about the Great Reset?
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:15.221]  How about Klaus Schwab?
[00:58:15.441 --> 00:58:17.601]  How about the New World Order?
[00:58:17.822 --> 00:58:18.642]  Who runs that?
[00:58:18.922 --> 00:58:21.043]  Identify them, and they won't be able to get away with it.
[00:58:21.063 --> 00:58:24.064]  But no, it's just their puppet that's about to preside over this disaster.
[00:58:24.784 --> 00:58:26.544]  Who can we get that's dominant to preside over this?
[00:58:26.584 --> 00:58:27.585]  Get Joe, he'll do it.
[00:58:29.866 --> 00:58:30.966]  Get Joe, he'll go along.
[00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:40.394]  Oh, but voters in the Rasmussen poll who make over $200,000 a year are much less worried about inflation and don't blame Joe Biden.
[00:58:42.374 --> 00:58:49.097]  Because when you're making $200,000 a year, you're spending less than 10% of your money on food.
[00:58:50.677 --> 00:59:02.051]   But I know when I was in college paying my own way and trying to have a couple jobs and do it, I remember Not buying the expensive food, buying the cheap food, buying the bargain food, because I wanted to live on my own when I was 18, 19.
[00:59:02.531 --> 00:59:06.092]  I had a couple jobs, and I was doing better than most people.
[00:59:06.312 --> 00:59:16.035]  Most of my money went to buy a nice car and insurance and decent clothes, but I was in an apartment, a nice apartment, had a nice pool and workout gym and stuff, and I took girls out on dates, but I was running out of money.
[00:59:16.055 --> 00:59:18.475]  Can you imagine an African or somebody in Latin America?
[00:59:18.495 --> 00:59:19.816]  They just starved to death, folks.
[00:59:21.229 --> 00:59:26.713]  A toll-free number to join us to talk about all these subjects and any item you want to raise, any angle you want to go with.
[00:59:27.073 --> 00:59:33.057]  I want to hear from you all on this Supreme Court nominee that can't say what a woman is and all the rest of it.
[00:59:33.457 --> 00:59:34.277]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:59:34.298 --> 00:59:34.438]  877-789-Alex.
[00:59:34.458 --> 00:59:34.518]  877-789-2539.
[00:59:34.538 --> 00:59:35.318]  First-time callers.
[00:59:35.138 --> 00:59:43.337]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:59:43.337 --> 00:59:47.577]   First time callers, long time callers, people from foreign countries, people that agree,
[00:59:47.577 --> 00:59:48.577]  people that disagree.
[00:59:48.577 --> 00:59:51.337]   We're taking all your calls on this and a lot more coming up.
[00:59:51.337 --> 00:59:53.578]  (thudding)
[00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:55.690]  Toll free number 877-789-ALEX.
[00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:57.271]  Alright, we come back.
[00:59:58.492 --> 01:00:03.955]  Hospitals worldwide under UN control, mass murdering people on record, and even bragging about it.
[01:00:04.235 --> 01:00:05.436]  We'll cover it all straight ahead.
[01:00:06.976 --> 01:00:11.159]  Why do they fear this broadcast above all others?
[01:00:12.259 --> 01:00:13.280]  Because I got in.
[01:00:15.287 --> 01:00:21.409]  And a lot of you got into areas in your life and saw the underbelly of what was happening and learned how the world really works.
[01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:27.990]  And I have a consortium of experts and callers and individuals on, whistleblowers, that have seen behind the veil.
[01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:35.832]  And together, like a jigsaw puzzle, we put the pieces into place and reverse engineer the enemy's operation.
[01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:37.553]  I just got chills.
[01:00:38.793 --> 01:00:42.714]  Because the Holy Spirit in me knows what I said was so on target, was so true.
[01:00:43.652 --> 01:00:51.479]  When we all realize we are collectively working together as individuals, but through free will forming a collective, we are unstoppable.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.722]  We're getting the phones loaded up here with a lot of callers.
[01:00:55.742 --> 01:00:56.743]  We'll go to your next segment.
[01:00:56.763 --> 01:00:57.944]  Appreciate you all calling in.
[01:00:57.964 --> 01:01:02.768]  I want to hit this story, and I've talked a lot about this.
[01:01:02.828 --> 01:01:09.134]  There's been a lot of big new developments, but sometimes I watch the rebroadcast or I listen to parts of it.
[01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:28.698]  And I just think, you know, you're such high energy, Jones, the whole time, when I'm being retrospective, looking at myself and how I behave as if I'm an outsider, sometimes you need to slow down a little bit, because that gives it more gravity.
[01:01:28.978 --> 01:01:35.181]  And I really don't have the gravity to highlight what I'm about to say.
[01:01:35.221 --> 01:01:36.962]  I mean, this is big stuff.
[01:01:38.786 --> 01:01:40.267]  And I have empathy.
[01:01:40.307 --> 01:01:41.108]  I know you have empathy.
[01:01:41.128 --> 01:01:42.429]  It's why you listen to this broadcast.
[01:01:42.869 --> 01:01:44.311]  And it's not because I'm a candy ass.
[01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:45.431]  It's not because I'm a bleeding heart.
[01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:55.319]  Empathy is when you see something happening to somebody else that's wrong, you don't like it because you instinctively know it's you or your family next.
[01:01:56.881 --> 01:02:01.865]  Now it manifests by a Christ-likeness where you want to help people because you really love them.
[01:02:04.527 --> 01:02:07.149]  And the greatest thing is one that lays down his life for his brother.
[01:02:08.476 --> 01:02:09.957]  Or his fellow man, his fellow human.
[01:02:12.037 --> 01:02:17.840]  But if we don't do something about this, it's on us.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.341]  And I am really convicted by this.
[01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:25.523]  In that I need to do something about it, and you need to do something about it.
[01:02:26.623 --> 01:02:35.127]  And I don't even want to hate Interpol, or the Justice Department, or the Royal Mounted Police, or any of these federal police agencies.
[01:02:37.358 --> 01:02:42.282]  I just wish that they weren't such cowardly, evil lawyers at the top.
[01:02:43.823 --> 01:02:52.270]  Because this is all open and shut, and I'm going to hit the news here, but it's really more important just to set the table here.
[01:02:52.290 --> 01:03:05.101]  Remember about four years ago, blackface governor of Virginia, then governor, got replaced recently, is a doctor who actually ran a hospital that would harvest organs of babies and sell them.
[01:03:06.755 --> 01:03:22.491]  He was on a show with two women and he said, listen, in that fake southern voice he uses, he's like, we don't want the government involved in anything we do.
[01:03:22.551 --> 01:03:24.974]  We don't want the men involved.
[01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:27.677]  We don't want the police involved.
[01:03:28.553 --> 01:03:29.694]  The women are nodding their heads.
[01:03:30.714 --> 01:03:38.959]  It's going to be the woman and at least two doctors are going to decide whether we keep baby comfortable.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.081]  And everything is a double-speak demon talk.
[01:03:42.502 --> 01:03:51.207]  The sick, sweet, oily, liberal voice that I'm not a predator where this guy literally harvests baby's organs, kills them.
[01:03:52.551 --> 01:03:59.854]  But of course, his camouflage, his coloration is, I'm a liberal, I'm lovin' for you.
[01:04:00.714 --> 01:04:04.796]  And he says, we don't want men involved with what a woman do, do we?
[01:04:04.856 --> 01:04:06.136]  The woman like, mm-hmm.
[01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:09.538]  On the radio show, we were shooting a video.
[01:04:10.918 --> 01:04:22.662]   He go, sometime we decide that you'll keep them comfortable, and sometime we let them go on and They don't get kept comfortable.
[01:04:24.103 --> 01:04:26.524]  Now he said, I had a black uniform all sharp.
[01:04:27.004 --> 01:04:31.527]  We keep them alive and harvest their organs once all the orders come in to get top bidder pricing.
[01:04:31.547 --> 01:04:34.588]  Everyone would just be carrying that hospital up.
[01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:36.770]  He'd be lynched out front in an hour.
[01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:37.650]  I'm not saying do that.
[01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:38.811]  I'm just saying that was what happened.
[01:04:39.511 --> 01:04:40.512]  He was in a Nazi uniform.
[01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:47.831]  Because he talks like a real man.
[01:04:47.831 --> 01:04:55.532]   Because he does that, he goes, "We don't want government involved or police."
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.460]  And women are like, no.
[01:04:57.421 --> 01:04:59.663]  And we don't want courts involved, no.
[01:05:00.583 --> 01:05:03.945]  It's between woman and doctor.
[01:05:05.687 --> 01:05:09.469]  And we decide whether baby live or baby die.
[01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:13.690]  We decide to resuscitate or not to resuscitate.
[01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:18.970]   Now that's not regular resuscitation where you fell off a five-story building while you're painting
[01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:23.449]   or you're replacing a light bulb and they show up and you're dead and they give you
[01:05:23.449 --> 01:05:25.689]   mouth-to-mouth and defibrillate you and start your heart again.
[01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:26.316]  No, no, no.
[01:05:28.017 --> 01:05:37.045]  In bioethics terms, because all these terms mean different things, keep baby comfortable means prep them, drug them up, put them in a coma, waiting to get their organs taken.
[01:05:37.826 --> 01:05:39.047]  That's keep baby comfortable.
[01:05:40.188 --> 01:05:41.429]  That's get them ready for harvesting.
[01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:48.408]   And resuscitation means They go, OK, we don't know if we want to keep this baby alive.
[01:05:48.468 --> 01:05:49.449]  The woman's all drugged up.
[01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:51.992]  We're going to get her to agree to say, oh, baby didn't look too good.
[01:05:52.652 --> 01:05:54.234]  You won't say bye-bye to baby?
[01:05:55.335 --> 01:05:56.056]  Oh, you agree?
[01:05:56.136 --> 01:05:57.097]  Oh, I got a doctor.
[01:05:57.117 --> 01:05:58.478]  So you got to have one more doctor.
[01:05:58.518 --> 01:05:59.479]  We agree.
[01:05:59.499 --> 01:06:00.621]  She said we're going to get the baby.
[01:06:01.621 --> 01:06:03.443]  And then, they kill it.
[01:06:03.723 --> 01:06:06.565]  But if they decide not to kill, because they're already deciding it's dead.
[01:06:06.906 --> 01:06:07.726]  This isn't a human.
[01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:10.289]  Under bioethics, we've decided this baby isn't a human.
[01:06:10.969 --> 01:06:13.632]  So they go, oh, the baby's not alive.
[01:06:14.632 --> 01:06:15.653]  You want to keep it alive?
[01:06:15.673 --> 01:06:17.235]  Oh, we're going to resuscitate.
[01:06:17.255 --> 01:06:17.995]  We're going to keep it alive.
[01:06:18.296 --> 01:06:18.836]  It's alive.
[01:06:18.856 --> 01:06:19.437]  It's heart's beating.
[01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:19.857]  No.
[01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:24.641]  Then if they decide to not resuscitate, that means they then kill it.
[01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:27.564]  See the pervert way of doing it?
[01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:29.713]  I'm not saying he's a pedophile.
[01:06:29.733 --> 01:06:30.453]  He just kills babies.
[01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:32.655]  Supports killing babies after they're born.
[01:06:32.915 --> 01:06:33.355]  Harvest workers.
[01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:40.019]  But I mean, if I was going to cast somebody for, you know, like a team of pedophiles, it'd be him and Brian Stelter, you know, for a movie.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.100]  Not center pedophiles.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.402]  He's just a ghoul that kills kids.
[01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:46.324]  But see, that's the whole basis of this, you see.
[01:06:46.344 --> 01:06:47.204]  I'm going to hit these articles.
[01:06:47.224 --> 01:06:48.265]  We're going to go to break.
[01:06:48.285 --> 01:06:48.745]  I'm going to hit these.
[01:06:48.765 --> 01:06:49.546]  I'm going to write your calls.
[01:06:51.223 --> 01:06:56.206]  You gotta get the flavor of the language they're using and how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:57.027 --> 01:07:23.163]   And then you'll know why, whether it's New Zealand or Australia or Germany or France, whether it's Austria or Ireland, whether it's Canada or the United States, in all Blue City globalist-controlled areas, The directive came down from the bioethics board of the insurance companies that run the hospitals now and said, we want you to give old people this group of drugs.
[01:07:23.703 --> 01:07:24.965]  That is lethal injection.
[01:07:27.288 --> 01:07:29.550]  But first you hook them up to an intubation.
[01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:41.673]  Run it for five days, or however long you max out their insurance, on top of the money you get for killing them, and then you give them the lethal injection drug.
[01:07:42.313 --> 01:07:43.053]  Which is on record!
[01:07:43.294 --> 01:07:44.474]  I got a whole stack of it right here!
[01:07:44.775 --> 01:07:45.996]  New articles about it today!
[01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:48.998]  And the articles are like, is it wrong we killed them?
[01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:52.300]  Is it wrong we gave them lethal injection?
[01:07:53.866 --> 01:07:55.207]  And nobody's stopping them!
[01:07:55.647 --> 01:08:03.091]  Not your local grand juries, not your federal, because they're all a bunch of candy-ass lawyers that watch CNBC and MSNBC and CNN.
[01:08:03.811 --> 01:08:05.992]  They're all a party to this mass murder.
[01:08:07.373 --> 01:08:08.114]  And we are back.
[01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:12.436]  Okay, so let me give you the boil-down, then I'll hit these stories and go to the calls.
[01:08:15.131 --> 01:08:24.495]  The Western world after World War II had a baby boom and our populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.S.
[01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:27.436]  doubled on average in the next 30 years.
[01:08:28.677 --> 01:08:32.418]  And now we have the biggest aged population in the world.
[01:08:32.478 --> 01:08:36.180]  Same numbers for Japan and China as well.
[01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.242]  China has more than doubled its population to one point almost five billion.
[01:08:42.723 --> 01:08:43.423]  India is the same.
[01:08:44.801 --> 01:08:53.388]  And so there's been a decision by BlackRock on record, and Bill Gates has given speeches at TED Talks about this, to just kill people at age 75.
[01:08:54.309 --> 01:09:06.598]  The main author of Obamacare, Ezekiel Emanuel, Rahm Emanuel's brother, has written essays and articles about how he hopes to die at 75.
[01:09:06.658 --> 01:09:09.160]  By the way, he's past 75 and hasn't died.
[01:09:09.521 --> 01:09:11.522]  He means he wants you to die at 75.
[01:09:14.286 --> 01:09:18.149]  Or younger, because they can't pay you your pension funds.
[01:09:18.249 --> 01:09:19.350]  They've stolen the money.
[01:09:19.530 --> 01:09:21.232]  And they don't want to go to jail like Bernie Madoff.
[01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:22.253]  They want you to die.
[01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:28.498]  There's the article in The Atlantic, by Steve Jobs' wife, that promotes pedophilia.
[01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:33.022]  So, here's an article, there's a bunch of these, and I actually have the study.
[01:09:33.422 --> 01:09:36.885]  Sweden bombshell report demolishes COVID-19 pandemic response.
[01:09:38.277 --> 01:09:43.821]  Many elderly people were administered morphine instead of oxygen despite available supplies effectively in their lives.
[01:09:44.081 --> 01:09:55.148]  And it goes on to say that bioethics boards and following directives of the UN and what Fauci said, this is global medical system, killed them.
[01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:03.574]  Oh, you don't get oxygen, you get morphine that makes you stop fighting and makes you stop struggling when you're not getting air, so you die.
[01:10:03.594 --> 01:10:09.145]   Because you're supposed to wake up when you're not getting enough air And, you know, walk around.
[01:10:09.185 --> 01:10:10.326]  That's one of the things you do.
[01:10:10.746 --> 01:10:11.586]  But no, no, no.
[01:10:11.606 --> 01:10:13.007]  Just take this, go to sleep, die.
[01:10:14.288 --> 01:10:18.131]  But hey, they went further in the United States, in Canada and the UK.
[01:10:19.091 --> 01:10:19.712]  Here's the study.
[01:10:19.732 --> 01:10:23.334]  Evaluation of science advanced during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden.
[01:10:23.374 --> 01:10:23.894]  It gets worse.
[01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:32.394]   just gotta go read it. Look at this New York Times article back in 2017 about a
[01:10:32.394 --> 01:10:37.233]   execution drug that's also a common sedative but it says on the insert do
[01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:43.073]   not take this if you're having breathing problems it will kill you.
[01:10:43.582 --> 01:10:58.289]  And it goes into, when the chemist named Armin Walzer invented the sedative more powerful than Valium more than 40 years ago, he thought his team had found something really special, and he goes on to say, but it kills people!
[01:11:00.037 --> 01:11:03.379]  And it's... medazolam.
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:10.224]  And England bought more than a hundred times what they'd ever bought before, six months before COVID, and stockpiled it.
[01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:16.808]  And then the government, their National Health Service, ordered to give it to people who couldn't breathe.
[01:11:18.309 --> 01:11:18.769]  There it is.
[01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:23.573]  Doctors ask for death penalty drugs to treat coronavirus.
[01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.975]  These are 25 states that still have the death penalty.
[01:11:28.252 --> 01:11:36.841]  So the left's like, oh don't kill a child molester or child murder, but oh my god, let's give the old people their shot.
[01:11:37.962 --> 01:11:39.223]  Death penalty states.
[01:11:40.399 --> 01:11:43.321]  Urge to release stockpiles of drugs for COVID-19 patients.
[01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:43.721]  Yes!
[01:11:44.362 --> 01:11:46.583]  Yes, give them the lethal injection.
[01:11:47.184 --> 01:11:47.924]  Drug scandal.
[01:11:47.964 --> 01:11:53.568]  Care homes accused of using powerful sedatives to make coronavirus victims die more quickly as use skyrocketed.
[01:11:53.808 --> 01:11:55.009]  That was the triage argument.
[01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:59.072]  Oh, the hospitals are supposed to be so full, we'll just kill the old people to make room.
[01:11:59.092 --> 01:12:00.093]  But all that was a lie.
[01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:05.316]  Stay in your house 15 days, wear a mask only 15 days, so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed.
[01:12:05.356 --> 01:12:14.203]   And it was all, two years later, the worst part about 15 days to flatten the curves the first two years, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:16.745 --> 01:12:20.168]  Mendozolam injection is being used to kill people in the UK.
[01:12:20.208 --> 01:12:21.649]  Big articles on that.
[01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:25.152]  So, did care homes use powerful sedatives to speed COVID deaths?
[01:12:25.532 --> 01:12:29.615]  Number of prescriptions for the drug doubled during the height of the pandemic.
[01:12:29.675 --> 01:12:31.417]  Yeah, and they stockpiled it so you could do that.
[01:12:33.739 --> 01:12:35.140]  So that's all the articles on it.
[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.061]  There's a bunch of others.
[01:12:37.128 --> 01:12:40.029]  But they're not accused, they did it and killed other people.
[01:12:40.689 --> 01:12:41.309]  And here it is.
[01:12:42.369 --> 01:12:47.591]  Supplies of sedative used for COVID-19 patients, diverted from France to avoid potential shortages.
[01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:53.832]  Yes, we've got to give it to people who can't breathe, even though it says don't give it to someone that can't breathe.
[01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:54.312]  Yes!
[01:12:54.892 --> 01:12:55.212]  Yes!
[01:12:55.913 --> 01:12:56.753]  Keep them comfortable!
[01:12:58.793 --> 01:13:05.775]  Oh, FDA reports shortage of sedative drug used for putting COVID-19 patients on ventilators, so they don't struggle.
[01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:11.843]  And it goes on and on.
[01:13:12.063 --> 01:13:17.307]  Oh, and even a small overdose of the drug that's used to calm people kills you.
[01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.048]  There's a Daily Mail article from years ago.
[01:13:19.649 --> 01:13:20.550]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:26.955]  And they gave them three times what you're supposed to give them and killed them, but it's liberal.
[01:13:28.676 --> 01:13:34.401]  Witnesses described the effects of execution drug, Mendozolam, but oh no, it's for COVID patients.
[01:13:36.242 --> 01:13:37.804]  Oh, there was such a shortage too.
[01:13:39.445 --> 01:13:40.689]  All right, I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:13:42.012 --> 01:13:43.497]  I really appreciate everybody calling in.
[01:13:43.677 --> 01:13:45.402]  We'll go into all the different subjects you want here.
[01:13:46.243 --> 01:13:48.044]  And then we got Roger Stone popping in for a couple of segments.
[01:13:48.064 --> 01:13:50.505]  We'll continue on with your calls and so much more.
[01:13:50.525 --> 01:13:52.185]  And then I am doing a special Saturday show.
[01:13:52.966 --> 01:13:55.347]  I didn't do the other live show I said because I was sick.
[01:13:55.367 --> 01:13:57.788]  I didn't know why I was dizzy and it turned out to be a sinus infection.
[01:13:58.388 --> 01:13:59.488]  They thought it was my heart or something.
[01:13:59.508 --> 01:14:00.689]  It was ridiculous.
[01:14:00.749 --> 01:14:01.569]  It was my sinus.
[01:14:02.049 --> 01:14:06.351]  Now the middle ear infection is not there and I'm not like wheeling around and you know having problems.
[01:14:06.411 --> 01:14:10.893]  I had to like hold on to the microphone and just kind of focus or I was stumbling around the office.

[01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:15.490]   ukraine and biden the lack of temperance and prudence there the lack of justice
[01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:19.090]   when it comes to how we're treating our citizens and when you study history which
[01:15:19.090 --> 01:15:22.850]   i know you're a fan of you know the decline of virtue has preceded the destruction of
[01:15:23.616 --> 01:15:23.916]  Absolutely.
[01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:28.238]  We are selfish, lying babies, and so we're going to collapse and die.
[01:15:29.372 --> 01:15:33.497]  Well, and I'm hoping that when it comes down to the people, people are going to be the ones that stand up.
[01:15:33.577 --> 01:15:45.710]  You know, in my local community, I'm working with local farmers trying to get local produce growing, and I try to stick to my niche, which is health and nutrition, and I try to spread the news and spread the love that way and tell everybody what they need to know.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.060]  In my niche.
[01:15:47.221 --> 01:15:53.165]  And then I just hope that when it all comes down to it, people stick up to their virtues and they do the right thing.
[01:15:53.545 --> 01:15:55.106]  Because that's what it's really going to come down to.
[01:15:55.406 --> 01:15:58.729]  You know, no institution is better than the people that comprise it.
[01:15:58.949 --> 01:16:00.590]  And our government do not reflect us.
[01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.191]  So it really does come down to us.
[01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:07.174]  So whatever gimmicks or games they want to pull, it's just going to come down to the virtue that we all have in our hearts.
[01:16:07.415 --> 01:16:12.218]  And like you said the other day, that true connection with God is what's really going to save this country.
[01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:25.064]  100% and I mean look it goes from oh just let homosexuals get married to let us have access to your five-year-old to tell them they're really another sex so we control their whole development robbing their whole future.
[01:16:25.465 --> 01:16:28.028]  This is about total control of our children.
[01:16:29.102 --> 01:16:30.203]  Yeah, it's disgusting.
[01:16:30.343 --> 01:16:33.285]  And on a side note, you know, everybody needs to go to InfoWarStore.com.
[01:16:33.405 --> 01:16:36.247]  Definitely buy DNA Force, especially with everything going on.
[01:16:36.287 --> 01:16:37.308]  It's a great supplement.
[01:16:37.348 --> 01:16:38.268]  I took mine this morning.
[01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:45.353]  And also, too, with mitigating the harmful effects of EMF, Mr. Jones, I highly recommend looking to Aries Tech.
[01:16:45.474 --> 01:16:47.035]  Aries, like the Zodiac, and Tech.
[01:16:47.575 --> 01:16:50.877]  I have it all over my technology, on my phone, on my iPad, on my computers.
[01:16:50.937 --> 01:16:53.199]  I think you would really, really like and appreciate it.
[01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:54.290]  I will, brother.
[01:16:54.330 --> 01:16:55.551]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:16:55.571 --> 01:16:56.832]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:59.073]  We're going to go right back to your calls on the other side.
[01:16:59.594 --> 01:17:04.918]  And since he mentions that, we have the biggest sale in our history, 75% off on more than 100 items.
[01:17:04.998 --> 01:17:10.843]  And a lot of these are great t-shirts, great books, great films that I said order or make that I never promoted because I get so busy.
[01:17:11.283 --> 01:17:13.545]  So these are really things a lot of you never heard of.
[01:17:13.865 --> 01:17:19.290]  They're like great shirts, great flags, great ball caps, great supplements, great films, great books.
[01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:24.376]  75% off, a bunch of them are 75% off at Infowarrestore.com.
[01:17:24.396 --> 01:17:32.419]  Go to the front page, you'll see the link, and find stuff from 30 to 75% off and help us clear out our warehouse and get money we need in to operate this operation.
[01:17:32.459 --> 01:17:32.779]  Thank you.
[01:17:33.859 --> 01:17:39.101]  All right, let's go to Kellan, then we'll go to Bart, Carlos, and many others.
[01:17:39.241 --> 01:17:42.382]  Kellan, in the great state of Texas, you're on the air.
[01:17:42.422 --> 01:17:42.982]  Thanks for calling.
[01:17:44.446 --> 01:17:46.027]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call, man.
[01:17:46.087 --> 01:17:50.391]  First of all, I wanted to plug your Down and Out off your InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:17:51.151 --> 01:17:53.333]  I took a bunch of prescription sleeping medicines.
[01:17:53.353 --> 01:17:56.896]  I've been struggling with, you know, sleep problems for, you know, three, four years.
[01:17:57.376 --> 01:18:01.480]  I started taking Down and Out about two months ago and it totally changed my sleep cycle.
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:07.965]  You know, it hits pretty quick and you do sleep throughout the night, so I wanted to thank you for pointing me onto that.
[01:18:08.544 --> 01:18:14.588]  Well that's my biggest problem, is that all these supplements are cutting edge, top of the line, and I forget to take them all myself.
[01:18:14.668 --> 01:18:23.535]  When I remember to take knockout that isn't as strong, I mean that's good folks, sometimes you don't want the strongest thing, compared to down and out, or rocket rest.
[01:18:23.895 --> 01:18:26.317]  There are three different formulas, three different systems.
[01:18:26.357 --> 01:18:30.881]  They're all very different, but Down and Out is the strongest and it does it naturally.
[01:18:30.901 --> 01:18:34.404]  So it's not like a sleeping pill that makes you sleep, but you're not getting REM sleep.
[01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:36.205]  It actually puts you in your natural sleep.
[01:18:36.225 --> 01:18:42.311]  You just reminded me that I exhausted a bottle of it like six months ago and never took it home to put it by my bed.
[01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:44.873]  I am the worst about taking my own supplements.
[01:18:46.641 --> 01:18:49.563]  Yeah, Alex, I'd recommend you get right back on it, man.
[01:18:49.603 --> 01:18:51.405]  I think it definitely helped me.
[01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:54.907]  And like you said, you don't feel like you're hungover the next day.
[01:18:54.927 --> 01:18:56.008]  You don't feel lethargic.
[01:18:56.349 --> 01:18:58.830]  Kind of just get up and attack the day, man.
[01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.573]  So I just really wanted to thank you for alerting me to that.
[01:19:01.713 --> 01:19:04.975]  Brother, I want to thank you for keeping us on air because all I want to do is beat these globalists.
[01:19:05.015 --> 01:19:06.096]  So you're our sponsor.
[01:19:06.456 --> 01:19:07.937]  Thank you so much, Kellen.
[01:19:08.538 --> 01:19:11.100]  What is your point on the whole Great Reset?
[01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:21.260]  Yeah, Alex, again, I just, I was a little skeptical about it at first, you know, two years ago when they first started with the lockdowns and the, you know, the 15 days of slow the spread.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.801]  And as I, my brother actually turned me on to you and actually started watching you.
[01:19:24.821 --> 01:19:26.422]  And I was like, this guy makes a lot of sense.
[01:19:26.482 --> 01:19:30.424]  I started doing a little bit more digging, you know, on some of the topics you were talking about.
[01:19:30.484 --> 01:19:34.646]  And it's, it's, it's just crazy to me how blatant, blatant in your face it is.
[01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:38.448]  It's almost like they think we're that stupid that we, that people don't notice that.
[01:19:38.468 --> 01:19:41.230]  And then I look at people in the street and I'm like, you guys are in a trance.
[01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:42.811]  So it's kind of hard, you know.
[01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:48.514]  I do my best to stay red-tailed and try to inform people in a polite way, you know.
[01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:52.087]   I don't want to I don't want to call him an idiot or call him stupid.
[01:19:52.127 --> 01:19:56.070]  I kind of just want to be like, hey, how do you not see this information that's right in front of your face?
[01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:09.698]  It's almost like there's a veil, and I feel like the veil has been kind of 50% lifted, and we got 50% of the country that thinks, you know, that believes in what we're talking about with the Great Reset and the Globe West, and you got people that the other half look at us like we're crazy.
[01:20:09.718 --> 01:20:10.679]  So I don't know.
[01:20:11.079 --> 01:20:11.919]  I've been praying a lot.
[01:20:11.939 --> 01:20:13.400]  I don't know where this thing's going, man.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.303]  So I just wanted to thank you for keeping everybody informed, and it definitely made a believer out of me.
[01:20:17.343 --> 01:20:17.863]  So thank you.
[01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:33.200]  Brother, God bless you, and look, what's happened is, Kellan, is they've put people in a near-trans state medically, that's on record, and then they can program animalistic, mindless, angry areas of their brains.
[01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:38.303]  And basically then turn them into robots that they control.
[01:20:38.904 --> 01:20:46.575]  And so what we're seeing is the weaker-minded people, for whatever reason, their upbringing, whatever, that have succumbed to the control.
[01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:51.702]  And as things get worse, they don't turn against the system and think that it screwed them over.
[01:20:53.513 --> 01:20:57.674]  They think us not submitting is the reason things aren't working.
[01:20:57.694 --> 01:20:58.494]  Does that make sense?
[01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:02.115]  So they think the inflation's really Trump's fault.
[01:21:02.195 --> 01:21:03.535]  They think it's really Putin's fault.
[01:21:03.876 --> 01:21:10.397]  They don't know that Klaus Schwab and the UN won inflation to bankrupt them, to make them totally desperate, so they can control them.
[01:21:10.417 --> 01:21:11.277]  Look, take black folks.
[01:21:11.698 --> 01:21:17.059]  They had less illegitimacy 60, 70 years ago, after World War II, than whites.
[01:21:17.879 --> 01:21:20.860]  White illegitimacy was about 8%, black illegitimacy was about 5%.
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.341]  Now black illegitimacy is at 80 percent, white illegitimacy is about 50.
[01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:35.023]  But they came in with money and government loans and said don't have your man in the house, broke down the family, hyped up gangster culture, and destroyed the black community.
[01:21:35.343 --> 01:21:37.483]  This is a scientific plan.
[01:21:37.543 --> 01:21:38.583]  Thank you for the call, Kellen.
[01:21:38.603 --> 01:21:39.124]  God bless you.
[01:21:40.484 --> 01:21:41.524]  That was another great call.
[01:21:42.224 --> 01:21:45.065]  Let's go ahead and go to Bart in Georgia.
[01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:45.805]  Bart, you're on the air.
[01:21:45.845 --> 01:21:46.145]  Welcome.
[01:21:47.265 --> 01:22:00.634]  Hey Alex, I just want to say, if we don't take radical action now, historians will, in the future, will refer to 2022 as the beginning of the second Great American Depression.
[01:22:00.994 --> 01:22:08.358]  I'm asking you to help us boycott gas and diesel, say one or two days a week on their busiest days, and try to shut them down.
[01:22:08.418 --> 01:22:09.519]  I don't know, what do you think?
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.321]  Well, I'm not an economist, but here's the deal.
[01:22:12.401 --> 01:22:19.528]   Once they create scarcity, You can boycott somebody when there's not scarcity that gets their attention.
[01:22:19.628 --> 01:22:28.273]  When there's not enough gas or diesel to sell, particularly diesel, that's the big shortages of that, as you alluded to, in Europe and the US, then they just don't care.
[01:22:29.334 --> 01:22:36.038]  And so what we need is to somehow inform people about this scam and our energy's being cut off.
[01:22:36.078 --> 01:22:44.704]   But if the American people don't see Biden shutting down all these pipelines, like Keystone and others, and then wonder why the prices are going up, Then that's their fault, but it's not their fault.
[01:22:44.764 --> 01:22:48.065]  Biden has like a 25% approval rating even in Cook polls.
[01:22:48.525 --> 01:22:50.786]  Even Democrats are turning against him, getting it's a scam.
[01:22:51.066 --> 01:23:01.423]   The problem is they steal elections and they're betting their whole midterm in 228 days on Terror attacks by patriot movements.
[01:23:01.463 --> 01:23:09.009]  Two weeks ago, Homeland Security officially said they believe there'll be a patriot terror attack dealing with election integrity, claiming Trump won.
[01:23:09.349 --> 01:23:15.614]  That way, when we question the election that they're going to steal in 228 days, they stole the last one, why wouldn't they steal this one?
[01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:19.037]  Then you're a terrorist, you see, if you question that.
[01:23:19.637 --> 01:23:20.718]  So you see where they're going, brother?
[01:23:22.051 --> 01:23:27.997]  Yes sir, and I also heard about a possible strike in the California oil refinery.
[01:23:28.017 --> 01:23:30.399]  I don't know if it's going to happen, but they're talking about it.
[01:23:30.679 --> 01:23:33.642]  Yes sir, there are strikes all over because they're trying to make them be inoculated.
[01:23:33.943 --> 01:23:42.211]  That's why the New York globalist mayor had to back off because all these movie stars and sports people wouldn't come to New York.
[01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:43.971]  Because they're not going to take the shots.
[01:23:44.011 --> 01:23:45.932]  They tell you to take the shots, but they're not taking them.
[01:23:46.432 --> 01:23:50.873]  He had to back off and say, we're not going to make rich people take the shots, only poor people.
[01:23:50.913 --> 01:23:51.613]  I'm not joking.
[01:23:51.893 --> 01:23:52.954]  Talk about discrimination.
[01:23:52.974 --> 01:23:54.214]  Talk about medical apartheid.
[01:23:57.495 --> 01:23:57.895]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:57.955 --> 01:24:09.198]  I just also want to point out, I don't know if anybody's ever said this, but just the fact that I got through and I'm not trying to pat myself on the back that I just passed the IQ test because the liberals are too stupid to get through to you on the problem.
[01:24:12.304 --> 01:24:13.084]  Brother, I hear you.
[01:24:13.344 --> 01:24:14.685]  I absolutely hear what you're saying.
[01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:16.505]  Where do you think this is all going, Bart?
[01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:27.669]  Well, I get feelings about these bad things that are going to happen, and I just feel that even though I know it's going to happen, there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:28.809]  It's just too powerful.
[01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:32.630]  So all you can do is pray to Jesus and get ready to meet God.
[01:24:33.010 --> 01:24:34.351]  I totally agree, because you know why?
[01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:35.351]  We turned on God.
[01:24:35.431 --> 01:24:38.692]  We killed billions of babies, 60-plus million in the U.S.
[01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:44.696]  We did all this, and that's why the devil knows to get us to do evil, and God removes himself, and then we're screwed.
[01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:46.817]  And so, yeah, we're gonna get hurt.
[01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:48.358]  The question is, how bad?
[01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:49.359]  I totally agree with you.
[01:24:49.819 --> 01:24:55.583]  People ask me all the time, like, how are you dealing with all the demonization and lies and the Justice Department trying to indict you and all that?
[01:24:55.603 --> 01:24:55.904]  I'm like...
[01:24:56.684 --> 01:24:58.105]  We're all on a sinking ship together.
[01:24:58.145 --> 01:24:59.765]  How do you think I'm dealing with it?
[01:24:59.905 --> 01:25:01.486]  You're sitting right next to me, brother.
[01:25:02.006 --> 01:25:04.547]  I mean, we are all in the same situation.
[01:25:04.587 --> 01:25:05.667]  Bart, thank you for that point.
[01:25:06.408 --> 01:25:08.248]  Since I mentioned it, let me actually show you the clip.
[01:25:08.268 --> 01:25:10.789]  I'm not like mainstream media that just says something and then never shows it.
[01:25:11.029 --> 01:25:12.690]  You know, Jones is a Nazi!
[01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:14.731]  Never show it, because it's not true.
[01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:20.633]  This is the mayor of New York, Eric Adams.
[01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:29.690]  Who ran on getting rid of the mandate, then wouldn't get rid of the mandate, but now nobody wants to come to New York, including just, you know, outsiders.
[01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:33.233]  So now he's saying, well, if you don't live in the city, you don't have to have the shots.
[01:25:33.433 --> 01:25:33.914]  Wow.
[01:25:34.374 --> 01:25:40.139]  So you're like an underclass of slaves that serve the system and all the rich people don't have to take the deadly injections.
[01:25:40.639 --> 01:25:46.264]  And then if you look at him, it's all black people on the stage with him, like, look, it's all black people.
[01:25:46.684 --> 01:25:56.467]  So, you need to do what I say and let the globalists raise your taxes and be above the law and only black people basically get kicked out of places and they don't take the shots.
[01:25:56.827 --> 01:25:57.908]  It's medical apartheid.
[01:25:59.848 --> 01:26:01.229]  But it's okay because he's black, see?
[01:26:01.609 --> 01:26:05.230]  They use blackface to carry out their execution operation.
[01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:05.850]  Here he is.
[01:26:06.831 --> 01:26:10.492]  That is not only the game of baseball, but that's the game of life.
[01:26:12.185 --> 01:26:16.768]  And we have to be on the field in order to win, in both the game of life.
[01:26:17.808 --> 01:26:25.712]  Today I signed Emergency Executive Order 62, expanding the performance exemption to private employer mandates.
[01:26:26.373 --> 01:26:31.616]  This is about putting New York City-based performers on a level playing field.
[01:26:33.037 --> 01:26:40.856]   Day one when I was mayor, I looked at the rule that stated hometown players had an unfair disadvantage
[01:26:40.856 --> 01:26:46.876]  for those who were coming to visit.
[01:26:46.876 --> 01:26:50.556]  And immediately, I felt we needed to look at that.
[01:26:50.556 --> 01:26:53.797]   But my medical professionals say, "Eric, we're at a different place.
[01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:58.117]   "We have to wait until we're at a place "where we're at a low area
[01:26:58.117 --> 01:27:01.235]  "and we can re-examine some of the mandates."
[01:27:01.235 --> 01:27:02.817]  We're here today.
[01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:09.476]   Currently, only non-residents are exempt under this executive order.
[01:27:09.576 --> 01:27:12.458]  We expanded it to residents of New York City.
[01:27:12.538 --> 01:27:12.979]  Wow.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.640]  Unimaginable.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:18.524]  We were treating our performers... Shut it down.
[01:27:18.544 --> 01:27:19.385]  Let's just stop.
[01:27:19.425 --> 01:27:22.448]  So, so, if you live in New York...
[01:27:24.312 --> 01:27:25.313]  You gotta take the shot.
[01:27:25.793 --> 01:27:29.676]  And then he spins that and goes, but if you're a performer that lives there, you don't have to.
[01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:30.576]  It goes on.
[01:27:31.477 --> 01:27:32.838]  I mean, this is next level, folks.
[01:27:32.918 --> 01:27:35.060]  I mean, if you're a good little globalist, you don't have to take the shot.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.020]  You're not?
[01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:37.641]  You gotta take it.
[01:27:37.742 --> 01:27:39.443]  I mean, next level.
[01:27:40.664 --> 01:27:44.186]  And by the way, that's some big news on the shots I haven't gotten to.
[01:27:44.606 --> 01:27:47.288]  But I'm gonna finish up with calls and go to Roger Stone and I'm gonna hit this.
[01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:51.772]  Remember that Rafael Nadal that put down Djokovic?
[01:27:52.816 --> 01:27:54.021]  He can't even play anymore.
[01:27:54.723 --> 01:27:55.607]  There's more to the story.
[01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.650]  He took his shot and there's consequences.
[01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:04.650]  [Music]
[01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:06.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[01:28:07.493 --> 01:28:10.395]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[01:28:10.935 --> 01:28:14.036]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[01:28:14.937 --> 01:28:15.777]  I was born for this.
[01:28:15.977 --> 01:28:16.838]  You were born for this.
[01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.479]  And people are really waking up right now.
[01:28:19.519 --> 01:28:26.023]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[01:28:26.163 --> 01:28:37.576]   And now, With Bandot Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[01:28:37.676 --> 01:28:40.840]  And because it's become so successful, it's a Catch-22.
[01:28:42.362 --> 01:28:48.127]  InfoWars and Band-Odd Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[01:28:48.527 --> 01:28:55.093]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[01:28:55.153 --> 01:28:58.215]  So, the biggest sale in InfoWars history is going right now.
[01:28:58.235 --> 01:28:59.917]  The Mega Emergency Blowout Sale.
[01:29:00.177 --> 01:29:00.838]  Up to 75% off.
[01:29:00.998 --> 01:29:04.481]  Get incredible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[01:29:05.148 --> 01:29:08.669]  All right, Roger Stone's coming up in 15 minutes for a couple of segments.
[01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:12.611]  I'll continue with your calls a little bit in the next hour when Jay Dyer takes over.
[01:29:12.631 --> 01:29:15.492]  I've got so much hit I haven't got to yet.
[01:29:15.512 --> 01:29:16.532]  We've already covered a lot, though.
[01:29:16.552 --> 01:29:17.733]  We're doing a decent job here today.
[01:29:18.493 --> 01:29:21.174]  We've got Bone Crusher, we've got Jake, we've got Greg.
[01:29:21.254 --> 01:29:22.955]  I'm going to these calls in the order they're received.
[01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:25.235]  Carlos is in Canada.
[01:29:25.816 --> 01:29:28.857]  He says Putin's setting up Russia for a traditional America.
[01:29:30.015 --> 01:29:31.156]  His actions are that.
[01:29:31.916 --> 01:29:33.137]  I study what the Russians are doing.
[01:29:33.157 --> 01:29:34.318]  They're paying people to have children.
[01:29:34.338 --> 01:29:35.919]  They're promoting Christianity.
[01:29:35.939 --> 01:29:38.600]  They're not letting the pedophile training go on the schools.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:39.921]  That's definitely true.
[01:29:40.581 --> 01:29:41.462]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:47.045]  But I have something to say about Biden's sanctions and who they're really helping here in a moment.
[01:29:47.085 --> 01:29:48.326]  But Carlos, go ahead and make your point.
[01:29:49.447 --> 01:30:00.758]   Well, I just wanted to mention, Alex, that in an annual message, Delivered to Congress by President James Monroe in the year 1823, in the month of December.
[01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:17.089]  He warned the American nations, sorry, he warned America to the European nations that the United States would not tolerate further colonization of America or the continent or puppet monarchs.
[01:30:18.208 --> 01:30:21.594]  This became known and is most... The Monroe Doctrine.
[01:30:21.614 --> 01:30:26.002]  Yeah, we went in Mexico and threw out puppet monarchs of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire repeatedly.
[01:30:26.886 --> 01:30:27.306]  Exactly.
[01:30:27.586 --> 01:30:28.726]  So the U.S.
[01:30:28.787 --> 01:30:38.629]  Monroe Doctrine, the day has come for Russia to establish its equivalent of what will become in history the Putin Doctrine, which essentially is the same.
[01:30:38.949 --> 01:30:45.311]  It will not tolerate any further encumbrances near its borders with nuclear, you know, facilities.
[01:30:45.331 --> 01:30:51.532]  Yeah, we heard the Marine Corps song, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[01:30:52.032 --> 01:31:03.989]   We repeatedly went down to Mexico and just Uh, took out the European dictators that were coming in and taking over Mexico, but usually, actually what in both cases, the Mexicans killed them before we could.
[01:31:06.522 --> 01:31:18.333]  Well, I spoke to my son yesterday, because he brought us some very good questions, and I said to him, would you know where NATO and the United States is taking this?
[01:31:18.714 --> 01:31:23.438]  Because I think it was pretty clear what Putin has been asking from the very beginning.
[01:31:23.718 --> 01:31:28.863]  He's just been saying, look, no militarized Ukraine, no denazification.
[01:31:30.725 --> 01:31:34.971]  Yeah, no more expansion, and I get all that, and also the Ukrainian deal with the nuclear weapons.
[01:31:35.332 --> 01:31:37.435]  Yeah, the West started the fight towards Tsarist practice.
[01:31:37.455 --> 01:31:38.055]  Here's the problem.
[01:31:39.224 --> 01:31:43.345]  I know that Biden's an idiot, Carlos, but the people running him aren't.
[01:31:44.145 --> 01:31:56.388]  Doing all these sanctions on Russia that's already basically self-sufficient now means he'll sell his fertilizer and his gas and oil to India and China, which are already outspacing and outpacing the West.
[01:31:56.808 --> 01:32:03.850]  The globalists want a Chinese century, and so if you look at the long-term effects, this will hurt American hegemony.
[01:32:05.703 --> 01:32:13.086]  Yes, and in the proxy war, the United States cannot afford to lose it with NATO, or Russia cannot afford to lose it.
[01:32:13.106 --> 01:32:15.548]  I understand, so I'm asking you, why then did they do this?
[01:32:17.068 --> 01:32:26.873]  Well, I think it, in all fairness, okay, I think it was the Belt Road Project with China was threatening... Which is only going to make that go quicker now?
[01:32:27.862 --> 01:32:29.263]  Right, exactly.
[01:32:29.523 --> 01:32:39.789]  And second, it was also the German welcoming of trade with Russia, very dynamically, and also having energy coming in from Russia ever more.
[01:32:39.809 --> 01:32:43.691]  A real new world order, if you want to call it.
[01:32:43.971 --> 01:32:45.032]  Yeah, well, Putin said that.
[01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.893]  He said the BRICS is the real new world order, yeah.
[01:32:47.713 --> 01:32:48.093]  Exactly.
[01:32:48.133 --> 01:33:03.239]  So at this stage of the game, some people who have different plans for the United States, being the hegemon, well, you know, they are turning to countries and telling them... And that's why Biden said, no, America will lead the New World Order, not Russia and China.
[01:33:04.153 --> 01:33:08.055]  Yeah, but you've got to give something in return, not just threaten people with an atomic bomb, okay?
[01:33:08.355 --> 01:33:13.658]  So, you know, look at Latin America, how United States treated, as you said correctly, Mexico and so on.
[01:33:13.978 --> 01:33:19.581]  So, it's, it's... Yeah, I mean, the Anglo-American banking system never delivers real development, it delivers debt.
[01:33:20.121 --> 01:33:21.942]  And China and Russia are delivering development.
[01:33:22.836 --> 01:33:37.545]  Yeah, right now, Alex, when you see all the sanctions, all the financial threats that are being thrown at Russia, you're seeing the fact that the moneylenders that I mentioned to you so long ago, they shouldn't be running the world.
[01:33:37.825 --> 01:33:50.352]  But now the moneylenders are coming out saying, hey, listen, you're going to kowtow to what we tell you with regards either to elderly people and pension payments, or whether it be the stock market being sustained or, you know, fiat currency controls.
[01:33:51.013 --> 01:33:51.393]  I hear you.
[01:33:51.433 --> 01:33:52.855]  Great points as always, Carlos.
[01:33:52.875 --> 01:33:53.415]  We'll be right back.
[01:33:53.235 --> 01:33:54.235]  Stay with us.
[01:33:54.235 --> 01:33:58.595]   All right, I'm only mentioning this every hour because we're getting literally thousands
[01:33:58.595 --> 01:34:01.395]  of calls to the office, tens of thousands of emails.
[01:34:01.395 --> 01:34:03.036]  I've got family, friends calling.
[01:34:03.036 --> 01:34:04.036]  Am I okay?
[01:34:04.036 --> 01:34:05.036]  Am I sick?
[01:34:05.036 --> 01:34:06.036]  What happened?
[01:34:06.036 --> 01:34:11.954]   Monday, Dr. Ben Marble was here and I'm going back to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:34:11.954 --> 01:34:15.595]   And during the break, I was kind of sweating and acting weird and kind of...
[01:34:15.802 --> 01:34:19.826]  I wasn't making a big deal about this to people because it had only been happening for a couple of days off and on.
[01:34:20.127 --> 01:34:20.928]  He said, what's wrong?
[01:34:21.748 --> 01:34:23.010]  I said, I'm dizzy.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.281]  And he said, Oh, I bet it's your heart.
[01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:27.941]  I'm not putting marble down, but it wasn't my heart.
[01:34:27.961 --> 01:34:29.102]  So I went and got a test.
[01:34:29.922 --> 01:34:32.783]  And, uh, he asked me, well, how does it happen?
[01:34:32.823 --> 01:34:33.444]  What's happening?
[01:34:33.464 --> 01:34:33.944]  This and that.
[01:34:33.964 --> 01:34:37.185]  And he said, you need to go to the emergency room right now to rule that out.
[01:34:37.705 --> 01:34:38.626]  I said, no, I'm not going.
[01:34:38.666 --> 01:34:40.666]  He said, well, let me at least call this doctor.
[01:34:40.686 --> 01:34:42.247]  I know that has diagnostics that send you there.
[01:34:43.308 --> 01:34:44.508]  When's the last time you had your heart checked?
[01:34:44.528 --> 01:34:44.948]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:34:44.988 --> 01:34:46.149]  And I said, well, years ago.
[01:34:46.669 --> 01:34:48.230]  So I finally got it on Wednesday.
[01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:51.571]  They did the scans and hooked me up to all this stuff, EKGs.
[01:34:52.423 --> 01:34:53.525]  No, basically said I was great.
[01:34:53.625 --> 01:34:55.488]  They took 16 things of blood, a bunch of tests.
[01:34:55.809 --> 01:34:57.612]  Half of them have come in showing I'm fine there.
[01:34:58.253 --> 01:34:59.715]  But I figured out by yesterday...
[01:35:00.673 --> 01:35:02.993]  I had a really bad sinus infection.
[01:35:02.993 --> 01:35:07.314]   So as soon as I got on antibiotics for it and everything else, last night, just boom,
[01:35:07.314 --> 01:35:09.193]  there was like a blockage up there.
[01:35:09.193 --> 01:35:13.273]   And that was why my middle ear was like, I mean, when I told him, he said,
[01:35:13.273 --> 01:35:14.113]  "What are you feeling?"
[01:35:14.113 --> 01:35:14.932]  I said, "Well, I'm dizzy."
[01:35:14.932 --> 01:35:15.773]  "Well, how bad is it?"
[01:35:15.773 --> 01:35:19.233]   I said, "Well, I almost ran off the road "coming to work this morning
[01:35:19.233 --> 01:35:24.314]   "'cause I literally had to start pulling over "because I was like dizzy."
[01:35:24.314 --> 01:35:25.753]  He goes, "Oh my God, that's probably your heart.
[01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:26.594]  "You gotta go."
[01:35:26.594 --> 01:35:29.872]   So, and they're like, "You're going to depositions "Wednesday and Thursday?"
[01:35:29.872 --> 01:35:30.712]  I said, "No."
[01:35:30.712 --> 01:35:31.953]  I said, "Well, I can't go to the doctor.
[01:35:31.953 --> 01:35:33.153]  "I can't go Wednesday either."
[01:35:33.153 --> 01:35:33.993]  And he goes, "Why?"
[01:35:33.993 --> 01:35:34.814]  "I got depositions."
[01:35:34.814 --> 01:35:35.653]  He goes, "You're crazy.
[01:35:35.653 --> 01:35:36.493]  "I'll write you a note.
[01:35:36.493 --> 01:35:39.113]  "You're dizzy, you're sweating, you gotta do this."
[01:35:39.113 --> 01:35:42.234]  And so that's what happened.
[01:35:42.234 --> 01:35:52.234]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:35:43.263 --> 01:35:45.164]  And I've already done three depositions with these people.
[01:35:45.184 --> 01:35:45.825]  They've got everything.
[01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:51.668]  They just scream and yell and claim all this stuff because the Democratic Party wants to end the First Amendment and the Second.
[01:35:51.908 --> 01:35:52.589]  They admit that.
[01:35:52.869 --> 01:36:00.874]  They've got rigged courts and they're just salivating to have a show trial supposedly starting here in Texas on the 25th of April.
[01:36:00.914 --> 01:36:01.815]  And it was just shameful.
[01:36:02.742 --> 01:36:09.268]  I mean, they have changed, we now learn, I said five times yesterday, that's what I knew of then, eight times they've changed deposition dates a few days before.
[01:36:09.588 --> 01:36:12.031]  We do that and we are the scum of the earth, man.
[01:36:12.511 --> 01:36:16.375]  I mean, you can be a child molester, Democrat judges let you out, no charges, or let you go.
[01:36:17.276 --> 01:36:22.060]  You can do whatever you want, but if you walked outside the Capitol, they put you in jail.
[01:36:22.381 --> 01:36:25.483]  If you were inside, you get a year of solitary confinement, no trial.
[01:36:26.504 --> 01:36:27.806]  Because these are just monsters.
[01:36:28.909 --> 01:36:33.612]  Absolute monsters that have no chivalry, no governor, no nothing.
[01:36:33.632 --> 01:36:35.954]  They're just abusing the power they have over us.
[01:36:36.394 --> 01:36:37.875]  And it's not going to end well, I can tell you.
[01:36:39.096 --> 01:36:39.616]  What a mess.
[01:36:41.858 --> 01:36:44.099]  And then, I mean, because I get my phone's ringing.
[01:36:44.119 --> 01:36:44.559]  Are you OK?
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:47.241]  Yeah, I didn't know what was going on.
[01:36:48.942 --> 01:36:54.966]  And I've had earaches off and on my whole life, you know, swim in a river, don't clean your ears out, get a bacterial infection.
[01:36:55.467 --> 01:36:57.428]  But I've never had vertigo like this.
[01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:02.194]  I don't want to make a big deal about it, and I got some other issues, like polyps in my throat.
[01:37:02.214 --> 01:37:04.474]  It's all my voices, so.
[01:37:04.514 --> 01:37:07.516]  I was about to get that done this week, but I had to postpone that because of this.
[01:37:07.976 --> 01:37:12.618]  And then just to see them then claim, no, you don't have a medical condition.
[01:37:13.138 --> 01:37:16.319]  You are going to go to our thing.
[01:37:16.699 --> 01:37:18.560]  It's the entitlement of the left.
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.501]  They think they own us, and they don't.
[01:37:21.161 --> 01:37:22.501]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:37:23.242 --> 01:37:23.602]  Hmm.
[01:37:25.002 --> 01:37:26.223]  That would be...
[01:37:30.285 --> 01:37:31.787]  Mary in New Jersey.
[01:37:31.847 --> 01:37:32.728]  Mary, thanks for holding.
[01:37:32.768 --> 01:37:33.088]  Go ahead.
[01:37:33.108 --> 01:37:35.410]  Hi, Alex.
[01:37:35.951 --> 01:37:36.472]  Hi, welcome.
[01:37:37.614 --> 01:37:47.380]  Hi Alex, I really wanted to say, I mean, you just happened to be talking about your health and that's why I was calling because, you know, Alex, there are so many people who love you.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:53.143]  As you said, they've been calling you, but all of us are coming with you to those depositions.
[01:37:53.343 --> 01:37:58.106]  Believe me, if there was some way that we could do it physically, I mean, I can't.
[01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:58.966]  I'm in Jersey.
[01:37:59.006 --> 01:37:59.927]  I'm not even worried about it.
[01:37:59.966 --> 01:38:03.885]  It's all a joke, little fame-seeking nobody lawyers.
[01:38:03.885 --> 01:38:05.326]  I mean, Blumenthal runs it all.
[01:38:05.326 --> 01:38:10.206]   He's a famous stolen glory guy, claimed he was in combat in Vietnam, never went to Vietnam.
[01:38:10.206 --> 01:38:11.206]  They're all just a bunch of scum.
[01:38:11.206 --> 01:38:13.166]  I mean, I'm not even worried about them.
[01:38:13.166 --> 01:38:17.165]  The war, the food shortages, the inflation is what matters.
[01:38:17.165 --> 01:38:22.466]   It's just how they make it a huge national issue, you know, it just shows how scared
[01:38:22.466 --> 01:38:24.805]  they are of our populism and our freedom.
[01:38:24.805 --> 01:38:27.005]  But you called in about food shortages, Mary.
[01:38:27.005 --> 01:38:28.685]  What do you want to say about that?
[01:38:28.685 --> 01:38:34.045]   Well, with what was going on with what Biden said, I mean, we've gotten to the point with
[01:38:34.045 --> 01:38:38.966]   our leaders that they're just kind of allowed to say, oh, this is what it is.
[01:38:38.925 --> 01:38:50.598]   A food shortage is like, I would think that for a president, that's one of the top You know, food security is one of the top things for them, so at what point... And he just nonchalantly says, yeah, it's gonna get real bad.
[01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:52.979]  Are sanctions on Russia or sanctions on you?
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:39:01.624]  Then you know it's really an environmental, corporate, Great Reset sanction, like locking us in our houses, like saying we're not essential.
[01:39:01.964 --> 01:39:03.264]  All of that is globalist.
[01:39:03.544 --> 01:39:09.647]  The Great Reset is sanctions on humanity by a bunch of greedy, inbred children of Nazis.
[01:39:09.728 --> 01:39:10.488]  You can't make it up.
[01:39:11.417 --> 01:39:15.200]  But what I'm trying to say is that if people were saying something like, well, you know what?
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:16.401]  He's not even being a leader.
[01:39:16.781 --> 01:39:17.742]  We should impeach him.
[01:39:17.802 --> 01:39:20.444]  There's always this, there's so much drama surrounding things.
[01:39:20.845 --> 01:39:32.634]  And the reality is to say, Biden, listen, if you can't handle this, the food insecurity thing, let's make a group of people who are specialists on it so that we could just know that we're being taken care of.
[01:39:32.654 --> 01:39:34.475]  This is not an acceptable answer.
[01:39:34.876 --> 01:39:38.519]  We are your CEO and a CEO would not accept that answer.
[01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:43.402]  So I really, I mean I'm going to be doing my own writing about this and just expressing myself.
[01:39:43.422 --> 01:39:44.103]  Well that's awesome!
[01:39:44.123 --> 01:39:45.463]  Where do people read your writing, Mary?
[01:39:46.564 --> 01:39:48.526]  Well I haven't, I haven't done it.
[01:39:48.626 --> 01:39:53.909]  I mean I would like to do it and I just... It doesn't matter where you do it, whether it's wherever you can, just do it.
[01:39:54.349 --> 01:39:55.270]  And Mary, we appreciate you.
[01:39:55.290 --> 01:39:56.151]  You have a beautiful voice.
[01:39:56.191 --> 01:39:56.731]  God bless you.
[01:39:56.751 --> 01:39:58.732]  I'm going to cram in as many calls as possible.
[01:39:58.813 --> 01:39:59.773]  Johnny in Tennessee.
[01:39:59.813 --> 01:40:00.414]  Johnny, go ahead.
[01:40:00.434 --> 01:40:02.335]  Hey Alex.
[01:40:02.895 --> 01:40:03.696]  Hey brother, go ahead.
[01:40:04.775 --> 01:40:05.035]  Thank you.
[01:40:05.235 --> 01:40:07.516]  With the bugs, uh, Hakuna Matata, baby.
[01:40:07.556 --> 01:40:08.756]  Do you remember Lion King?
[01:40:08.976 --> 01:40:18.920]  With the bugs, the lion goes off into the pride and gets, uh, convinced bugs is a good way to... That's right, he learns to stop eating meat and learns to eat maggots with, uh, with Koomba.
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:20.801]  Or who's the farting warthog?
[01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:22.281]  Poomba!
[01:40:22.821 --> 01:40:23.061]  Poomba?
[01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:24.282]  Yeah, Poomba.
[01:40:25.942 --> 01:40:27.903]  Man, they've been programming us for a while, haven't they?
[01:40:29.444 --> 01:40:31.084]  But remember, he goes back to the pride.
[01:40:32.745 --> 01:40:33.205]  Absolutely.
[01:40:35.131 --> 01:40:40.593]  So that's just something a little funny, but I wanted to talk about the founding fathers and legislation.
[01:40:41.393 --> 01:40:53.696]  I think my projection within five to ten years, we're going to have the Supreme Court have to decide on legislation from the Civil War and the Revolutionary Era.
[01:40:56.897 --> 01:40:57.838]  Elaborate on that.
[01:40:59.398 --> 01:41:11.172]   So that's why the Supreme Court is so important these last These last few trials, as we know, the 3% rule will affect how history is written.
[01:41:11.872 --> 01:41:19.416]  If you go back to the Revolutionary War, technically what the Founding Fathers did was illegal under the rule of law.
[01:41:20.136 --> 01:41:36.193]   So what I'm seeing in the next few years, I think between the Declaration of Independence, where it says about a long chain of abuses and usurpations, I think something like that is going to go against the 18 U.S.
[01:41:36.052 --> 01:41:43.492]   them under absolute despotism. It's our right and duty. So when you, I think
[01:41:43.492 --> 01:41:51.971]   something like that is gonna go against the 18 U.S. Code 2383 under
[01:41:51.971 --> 01:41:55.292]   rebellions and insurrections. Well that's right the Declaration of
[01:41:55.292 --> 01:42:01.891]   Independence overrides all these laws saying we can't even protest this insurrection.
[01:42:00.213 --> 01:42:01.394]  We have a right to revolt.
[01:42:01.774 --> 01:42:06.275]  And a lot of states actually, like New Hampshire, have it in their state constitution, the right to revolt.
[01:42:06.615 --> 01:42:11.676]  It is not just our right, it is our duty to get rid of systems of government that oppress us.
[01:42:14.377 --> 01:42:15.497]  Exactly, yes.
[01:42:15.737 --> 01:42:20.298]  It clearly, I'd recommend everyone, I mean it's the obvious thing, go back and read there.
[01:42:21.923 --> 01:42:25.046]  It clearly states exactly what's happening.
[01:42:25.086 --> 01:42:34.634]  But really quick, I think what's going to happen is a redeclaration of independence is going to go around online somewhere about five years from now.
[01:42:35.735 --> 01:42:43.982]  And it can go either two ways because with the 3% rule right now, that's about 15 million people that change history.
[01:42:44.603 --> 01:42:52.058]   I see that will either be shut down or will Thank you so much for the call sir.
[01:42:52.019 --> 01:42:56.579]   Well that's right, and the left knows that, so they're a tiny minority of behavioral psychologists
[01:42:56.579 --> 01:43:01.298]   that want absolute power, posing as good guys, taking over and engaging in incredible crime.
[01:43:01.298 --> 01:43:03.618]  Thank you so much for the call, sir.
[01:43:03.618 --> 01:43:04.618]  Great points.
[01:43:04.618 --> 01:43:09.979]   All right, the great Roger Stone is on the road in New Jersey, New York, I'm not sure
[01:43:09.979 --> 01:43:16.298]   where, but he's going to exclusively respond to this Trump suit that he's all over against
[01:43:16.298 --> 01:43:20.858]   the deep state and their whole Russia hoax, and why that is so important, because they're
[01:43:20.858 --> 01:43:27.378]   betting the whole midterms, 228 days, on terror attacks that are imminent from Roger Stone
[01:43:27.378 --> 01:43:28.539]  and myself and others.
[01:43:28.552 --> 01:43:29.472]  Absolute BS.
[01:43:29.892 --> 01:43:31.873]  So, Roger Stone, straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:43:34.039 --> 01:43:36.600]  Well, I was just talking to Roger Stone yesterday.
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:37.521]  He was in New Jersey.
[01:43:37.541 --> 01:43:39.602]  And I asked him to come on.
[01:43:39.642 --> 01:43:43.163]  He couldn't go on Owen's show because he was on the road.
[01:43:43.183 --> 01:43:54.889]  But now he's joining us to respond to this huge lawsuit that Trump has filed really detailing the criminal activity of the deep state against President Trump and the American people and our electoral process.
[01:43:54.969 --> 01:43:57.730]  True election meddling documented here.
[01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:58.531]  And I asked where he is.
[01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:03.032]  He is in Connecticut visiting his parents' gravesites.
[01:44:03.792 --> 01:44:07.292]  And so thank you so much, Roger Stone, for joining us.
[01:44:07.833 --> 01:44:10.133]  Let's get right into this and some of these other big issues.
[01:44:12.613 --> 01:44:17.034]  Alex, this is an extraordinarily shrewd move by Donald Trump.
[01:44:17.774 --> 01:44:20.375]  When Trump is good, he's really, really good.
[01:44:21.095 --> 01:44:29.706]   And this has both, in my opinion, a legal value and a very large political value. If you read the president's complaint,
[01:44:29.706 --> 01:44:36.765]   first of all, he's filed this as a RICO action. He basically accuses Hillary Clinton and her
[01:44:36.765 --> 01:44:39.625]  entire criminal cabal of racketeering.
[01:44:39.625 --> 01:44:49.786]   And that he lays out methodically, almost on a timeline basis, the entire effort to destroy his
[01:44:49.786 --> 01:44:57.064]   presidency, the use of fabricated evidence in both the Steele dossier and the so-called CrowdStrikes
[01:44:57.064 --> 01:44:58.666]  report.
[01:44:58.826 --> 01:45:15.001]  The creation of the fabricated narrative that the Russians hacked the DNC and somehow gave the fruits of that hack to the Trump campaign, the involvement, the illicit involvement of both the FBI and the CIA.
[01:45:15.902 --> 01:45:19.685]  This is a brilliant PR move, if not a brilliant legal move.
[01:45:19.765 --> 01:45:24.610]  Now, specifically, he filed this in the Southern District of Florida.
[01:45:25.373 --> 01:45:29.894]  Uh, where he appointed seven of the ten federal judges in the circuit.
[01:45:30.474 --> 01:45:38.917]  Needless to say, it immediately is assigned to a judge appointed by President Bill Clinton, Donald M. Middlebrook.
[01:45:38.997 --> 01:45:42.778]  It never, it never evens the magic judicial power they have.
[01:45:44.266 --> 01:45:45.527]  No, it's really amazing.
[01:45:45.987 --> 01:45:47.949]  Supposed to be, as you know, done randomly.
[01:45:48.730 --> 01:45:54.554]  Middlebrooks is known as the king of the docket rocket.
[01:45:54.755 --> 01:46:02.541]  He is known for making quick decisions, of moving the backlog of cases in front of him very quickly.
[01:46:02.961 --> 01:46:06.604]  He's not known as a terribly political judge.
[01:46:07.465 --> 01:46:17.693]   Republicans, I spoke to him this morning, respect Judge Middlebrook, but The real question on the legal front is whether he will quickly dismiss the lawsuit.
[01:46:18.453 --> 01:46:22.817]  I would argue whether he dismisses it or not is almost irrelevant.
[01:46:22.877 --> 01:46:24.498]  What Trump has done here is brilliant.
[01:46:24.958 --> 01:46:27.480]  Their narrative for the election is January 6th.
[01:46:28.521 --> 01:46:39.769]  Our narrative is Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama, and the greatest single political dirty trick in American history.
[01:46:40.475 --> 01:46:42.296]  In other words, they call me a dirty trickster.
[01:46:42.337 --> 01:46:43.678]  Well, I reject that.
[01:46:44.318 --> 01:46:52.725]  But if we assume it's true, then it takes one to know one, and the Russian collusion hoax is the greatest political scandal in our history.
[01:46:53.065 --> 01:46:55.667]  It makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[01:46:55.687 --> 01:47:03.774]  They claim the American people electing Trump was really the Russians, and thus are trying to steal an election retroactively from the American people.
[01:47:03.834 --> 01:47:05.435]  It's outrageous criminal activity.
[01:47:06.542 --> 01:47:13.345]  Not only that, but more importantly, the whole goal of the Russian collusion hoax is to hide their own crimes in Ukraine.
[01:47:13.806 --> 01:47:15.807]  To hide their own crimes in Russia.
[01:47:16.267 --> 01:47:26.872]  As I've said previously, and I have no fear of lawsuit, Hillary Clinton and her cabal, John Podesta and others, made millions from the oligarchs around Vladimir Putin.
[01:47:27.312 --> 01:47:39.748]   Millions in banking, millions in oil and gas, millions in insurance, and to hide those crimes, to hide the sale of control of America's stockpiles of
[01:47:39.748 --> 01:47:45.559]   uranium, for example, it is right out of the Alinsky playbook.
[01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:47.559]  And let's expand on that.
[01:47:47.559 --> 01:47:51.559]   I don't think there's a deal between them and Putin, but by Biden saying,
[01:47:51.559 --> 01:47:53.559]  "Go ahead and invade, we won't do anything," he does it.
[01:47:54.019 --> 01:48:00.643]  Now the sanctions only help India and help China with all the oil and fertilizer Russia sells them.
[01:48:00.943 --> 01:48:02.704]  This isn't even going to hurt Russia, they admit.
[01:48:02.764 --> 01:48:03.365]  It hurts us.
[01:48:03.745 --> 01:48:08.248]  And Biden's on TV saying it's a sanction on you while he shuts down our pipelines.
[01:48:08.308 --> 01:48:11.450]  I mean, why is the left trying to bankrupt America?
[01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:12.351]  To make us controllable?
[01:48:13.943 --> 01:48:15.204]  I think that's exactly what it is.
[01:48:15.264 --> 01:48:28.874]  If you examine the sanctions, American banks are specifically exempted when it comes to energy deals where Americans are buying crude and oil and gas from the Russians.
[01:48:29.314 --> 01:48:35.618]  So all we're really doing is financing Putin at the same time we claim to be sanctioning him.
[01:48:35.959 --> 01:48:37.740]  And this is what I'm really sick of, Alex.
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:41.622]  Uh, going online and saying that I'm pro-Putin or pro-Russian.
[01:48:41.922 --> 01:48:43.823]  No, I'm actually pro-American.
[01:48:44.203 --> 01:48:59.651]  So, if you're not in favor of putting offensive missiles in Ukraine pointed at Russia, if you're not in favor of taxpayer financing of 15 bio-weapons labs cooking up God knows what pestilence to dump on the Russian people, that makes you pro-Russian.
[01:48:59.691 --> 01:49:01.412]  No, it makes you against World War III.
[01:49:02.904 --> 01:49:08.888]  I saw Bill O'Reilly attacking you and I and Tucker Carlson for being pro-Russian.
[01:49:08.948 --> 01:49:10.109]  How do you raise that?
[01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:12.471]  I was literally sending that image to the producer.
[01:49:12.511 --> 01:49:13.531]  I forgot to send it to him.
[01:49:13.831 --> 01:49:15.032]  Here, I'll just show TV viewers.
[01:49:15.553 --> 01:49:16.313]  Look at this, folks.
[01:49:17.374 --> 01:49:21.514]   Bill O'Reilly says, First of all, is Bill O'Reilly actually still alive?
[01:49:21.333 --> 01:49:26.092]   pundits. Tucker Carlson is number one, I'm jealous. Roger Stone is number two, I'm
[01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:31.054]   jealous. Alan Jones is number three. JD Vance, Tulsi Gabbard and Candace Owens, all
[01:49:31.054 --> 01:49:34.333]  because we're just being honest about everything.
[01:49:34.333 --> 01:49:35.573]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:35.573 --> 01:49:40.293]   Is Bill O'Reilly actually still alive? I'm not aware of whether... is he actually still alive?
[01:49:40.293 --> 01:49:44.532]  Because I haven't seen the guy in years.
[01:49:43.209 --> 01:49:44.290]  He's not a conservative.
[01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:46.833]  Well, he crashed and destroyed Trump's rallies.
[01:49:47.234 --> 01:49:48.275]  No one wanted to buy the tickets.
[01:49:48.295 --> 01:49:49.096]  They were all a big failure.
[01:49:49.116 --> 01:49:49.896]  They had to give the tickets away.
[01:49:50.197 --> 01:49:51.838]  I mean, I mean, he's literally I mean, look at this.
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:54.161]  Oh, we're support Putin.
[01:49:54.501 --> 01:49:55.943]  I don't support the invasion.
[01:49:55.963 --> 01:49:57.104]  I've been against it from day one.
[01:49:57.344 --> 01:50:00.387]  But I've shown how Soros bragged he got Putin to attack.
[01:50:00.648 --> 01:50:02.510]  I don't like I don't I don't like poking the bear either.
[01:50:04.574 --> 01:50:11.020]  Well, a man is known by the company he keeps, and if I'm with Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, I'm in great company.
[01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:14.284]  Bill O'Reilly has no credibility and no audience.
[01:50:14.764 --> 01:50:17.487]  I would argue he has no talent, but that's a separate issue.
[01:50:17.507 --> 01:50:18.428]  Well, he's also a pervert.
[01:50:18.448 --> 01:50:19.949]  He doesn't even know how to pick up women, either.
[01:50:20.349 --> 01:50:23.633]  All those creepy transcripts of how he would, like, harass his employees.
[01:50:24.694 --> 01:50:25.174]  I mean, yeah.
[01:50:26.499 --> 01:50:27.160]  Got no game.
[01:50:29.121 --> 01:50:30.142]  It's really disgraceful.
[01:50:30.563 --> 01:50:39.531]  Look, the thing I hate about being accused of being a Russian stooge is I had family members mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[01:50:39.971 --> 01:50:49.040]  I am 100%, like you Alex, pro-American and I will step aside to no one when it comes to doing what's best for our country.
[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:52.283]  But this war in Ukraine is not about the United States.
[01:50:52.683 --> 01:50:54.905]  It's about the New World Order.
[01:50:55.705 --> 01:51:05.233]  It is about covering up the corruption of the Ukrainian piggy bank, which had been used by Hunter Biden and the Bidens and the Obamas and the Clintons.
[01:51:05.293 --> 01:51:05.713]  I agree.
[01:51:05.733 --> 01:51:06.954]  So where does Trump go from here?
[01:51:06.974 --> 01:51:09.196]  As I was reading this lawsuit last night, I probably read half of it.
[01:51:09.216 --> 01:51:10.477]  Like I said, it's a book.
[01:51:10.777 --> 01:51:12.218]  Trump ought to publish this as a book.
[01:51:12.498 --> 01:51:13.939]  I mean, this is really riveting.
[01:51:14.179 --> 01:51:16.481]  Plus, I've researched it all, so I know how accurate it is.
[01:51:16.721 --> 01:51:18.883]  But this reminded me of the damn crimes they committed.
[01:51:19.143 --> 01:51:21.125]  And you're all over this thing and the stuff they did to you.
[01:51:22.566 --> 01:51:25.368]  Yeah, that's why I think it's important that he's memorialized it.
[01:51:25.788 --> 01:51:29.951]  Peter Tickton, the lawyer handling this for him, is a very able fellow, friend of mine.
[01:51:29.971 --> 01:51:30.572]  Hey, stay there, Roger.
[01:51:30.592 --> 01:51:32.093]  We're going to come right back and talk about more.
[01:51:33.114 --> 01:51:33.514]  All right.
[01:51:33.754 --> 01:51:41.600]  In the final segment with Roger Stone here, and then I'll come back and take your calls and cover breaking news, I want to ask him what's front and center, as I always say, on his radar screen.
[01:51:41.620 --> 01:51:45.502]  But obviously, Roger, you and I were talking this morning some.
[01:51:46.103 --> 01:51:50.066]  I'm not ready to release this information yet, but I told you about it with what's going on with the Justice Department.
[01:51:51.047 --> 01:51:51.707]  And other things.
[01:51:52.208 --> 01:51:56.770]  And just 228 days out from the election, they're betting everything on this.
[01:51:56.810 --> 01:52:06.716]  They put out their terror report last June, saying it's not Islamic terrorists, it's not Russians, it's not Chinese, it's not Mexican mafia, it's people that question elections and lockdowns.
[01:52:06.756 --> 01:52:12.699]  Now they, last week, put out another report saying imminent terror attacks from people questioning the election.
[01:52:12.719 --> 01:52:13.600]  So it's pretty clear.
[01:52:13.860 --> 01:52:15.401]  Blow stuff up, shoot up a church.
[01:52:16.121 --> 01:52:22.503]  Say it's because this election was stolen from Trump, then they steal the midterm, and anybody that questions midterm fraud is a terrorist.
[01:52:22.543 --> 01:52:25.004]  I mean, this is not hard to see where they're going.
[01:52:25.024 --> 01:52:27.124]  Do you agree with that, and how do we counter that?
[01:52:28.425 --> 01:52:29.785]  I totally agree with that, Alex.
[01:52:29.825 --> 01:52:35.247]  What you have going on right now, from a macro point of view, is a struggle over the narrative.
[01:52:35.367 --> 01:52:38.708]  The left's narrative is January 6th is an insurrection.
[01:52:39.301 --> 01:52:45.846]  I came to New York because they are trying to terminate a fine American police officer, a brave officer.
[01:52:45.906 --> 01:52:47.007]  Oh, I meant to bring that up.
[01:52:47.067 --> 01:52:49.289]  A great guy that volunteered as a security guy.
[01:52:49.349 --> 01:52:50.610]  Met him, had dinner with you guys.
[01:52:50.670 --> 01:52:51.170]  A great guy.
[01:52:51.210 --> 01:52:51.791]  Tell us about that.
[01:52:52.836 --> 01:53:04.143]  Yeah, Sal Greco, a New York police officer who has served honorably for 14 years, has an unblemished record of patrolling in some of the most dangerous and undesirable precincts in New York.
[01:53:04.663 --> 01:53:14.168]  The graveyard shift now is being considered for termination and termination of his pension because he was with us on January 5th and 6th.
[01:53:14.468 --> 01:53:15.609]  We're gonna have to go to court.
[01:53:15.629 --> 01:53:18.091]  You can help this guy at helpthisnewyorkcop.com.
[01:53:19.011 --> 01:53:21.853]  This guy is a great Italian-American from Staten Island.
[01:53:22.133 --> 01:53:23.954]  He's done nothing whatsoever wrong.
[01:53:23.994 --> 01:53:27.016]  This is yet another political persecution.
[01:53:27.156 --> 01:53:34.240]  And to be clear, the current mayor was Mike Tyson's security guard, which is great, wonderful, when, you know, Mike is a felon.
[01:53:34.881 --> 01:53:42.185]  But they're claiming because you're a felon with a commuted sentence and pardoned that he's gonna lose his job because he's friends with you.
[01:53:42.225 --> 01:53:44.427]  I mean, this is just more McCarthyite BS.
[01:53:45.475 --> 01:53:46.318]  That's exactly right.
[01:53:46.338 --> 01:53:52.238]  So Mayor Eric Adams, who was a New York police captain, provided security for Mike Tyson when he was a convicted felon.
[01:53:54.747 --> 01:53:56.409]  By the way, I want to ask the police commissioner.
[01:53:56.229 --> 01:54:01.948]   But in the case of Sal Greco, because he's a Trump supporter and a friend of mine, he
[01:54:01.948 --> 01:54:06.508]   stands to lose the $250,000 that he's paid into a pension fund.
[01:54:06.508 --> 01:54:07.508]  It's outrageous.
[01:54:07.508 --> 01:54:09.349]  It'll end up in the federal courts.
[01:54:09.349 --> 01:54:11.628]  Mayor Adams will end up on the stand.
[01:54:11.628 --> 01:54:16.788]   By the way, I want to ask the police commissioner, if nobody at NYPD has any communications with
[01:54:16.788 --> 01:54:20.509]  any convicted felons, how do their street informants work?
[01:54:20.509 --> 01:54:22.427]  Exactly how does that work?
[01:54:22.451 --> 01:54:23.251]  It's a load of crap.
[01:54:23.271 --> 01:54:24.272]  Let me ask you about this.
[01:54:24.392 --> 01:54:28.033]  A great jurist compared to the Democrats, Clarence Thomas, and his wife's amazing.
[01:54:28.613 --> 01:54:32.695]  She's sending text messages to the White House even staff saying, hey, look at this fraud, do something.
[01:54:32.955 --> 01:54:35.076]  That's her right as an American to call for investigation.
[01:54:35.396 --> 01:54:40.638]  They're trying to call her into January 6 and have her messages now and are demonizing Clarence Thomas.
[01:54:40.718 --> 01:54:42.339]  I mean, this is just getting insane.
[01:54:43.584 --> 01:54:46.108]  Yeah, this is an entire trend that's very disturbing.
[01:54:46.489 --> 01:54:57.386]  Take constitutionally protected free speech and constitutionally protected political activity, including the right to free assembly, and somehow try to criminalize it.
[01:54:57.910 --> 01:55:03.011]  Ginny Thomas has the right to send a text message with her political views to anyone she wants.
[01:55:03.391 --> 01:55:04.271]  It's not seditious.
[01:55:04.571 --> 01:55:05.472]  It's not treasonous.
[01:55:05.712 --> 01:55:06.492]  It's not illegal.
[01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:07.932]  It's not even improper.
[01:55:08.212 --> 01:55:10.113]  It's her right as an American.
[01:55:10.133 --> 01:55:15.414]  They want to outlaw questioning elections because they're stealing them everywhere and the poll numbers and facts show that.
[01:55:15.454 --> 01:55:17.754]  So I told you privately this morning, we're not going to release it yet.
[01:55:18.114 --> 01:55:18.955]  We may do it next week.
[01:55:19.375 --> 01:55:22.755]  What do you make of the latest stuff with the Justice Department and what they're trying around here?
[01:55:22.815 --> 01:55:24.956]  I mean, this is this is getting comical.
[01:55:25.016 --> 01:55:25.556]  It's so evil.
[01:55:26.752 --> 01:55:33.836]  Well, I think it's very obvious, for example, that the prosecution of Owen Schroer is a complete and total fraud.
[01:55:34.016 --> 01:55:45.161]  Owen Schroer's done nothing whatsoever wrong, never entered the building, wasn't in a restricted area, wasn't on a bullhorn, didn't say anything incendiary in public or on social media.
[01:55:45.281 --> 01:56:07.011]   Owen Schroer is a victim because he's an American, because he was there to peacefully protest And hope to get a 10-day delay in the certification of Joe Biden as President of the United States so that we could more thoroughly examine the fraudulent results in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona.
[01:56:07.291 --> 01:56:16.055]  That's his right as an American, Alex, but they're going to try to use that, I think, to pressure him, to pressure you, to pressure me, to pressure anybody.
[01:56:16.095 --> 01:56:17.596]  It's all guilt by association.
[01:56:18.016 --> 01:56:28.106]  Yeah, we're not going to break it yet, but I always said, well, they're dumb if they think, you know, Owen will lie about me, which of course he wouldn't, but instead it's, we're going to put Owen in prison unless you do what we want.
[01:56:28.206 --> 01:56:33.972]  I mean, I just, these people, the fact that they say this over telephones to you, it's like they just have no shame.
[01:56:35.137 --> 01:56:36.197]  No, it's unbelievable.
[01:56:36.397 --> 01:56:39.418]  Guilt by association is their favorite tactic.
[01:56:39.478 --> 01:56:43.139]  In other words, Roger Stone has spoken to the President, yes.
[01:56:43.619 --> 01:56:47.501]  And Roger Stone has met Enrique Tarrio of the Proud Boys, yes.
[01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:49.481]  Therefore, no, therefore nothing.
[01:56:50.161 --> 01:56:53.862]  The worst guy at this, by the way, is Ari Melber on MSNBC.
[01:56:54.202 --> 01:56:56.183]  So let's use his logic for a moment.
[01:56:56.683 --> 01:56:58.524]  Ari Melber works at NBC.
[01:56:58.964 --> 01:57:01.145]  He's a colleague and friend of Matt Lauer.
[01:57:01.585 --> 01:57:07.748]  Matt Lauer has been accused of anally assaulting, anally raping and assaulting women.
[01:57:08.048 --> 01:57:10.930]  Does that mean that Ari Melber has also done so?
[01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:13.371]  Well, by his reasoning, the answer would be yes.
[01:57:13.871 --> 01:57:15.552]  See, that's guilt by association.
[01:57:15.592 --> 01:57:16.212]  It's unfair.
[01:57:16.492 --> 01:57:17.192]  It's outrageous.
[01:57:17.212 --> 01:57:20.034]  Yeah, he's not raping women in their rear ends.
[01:57:22.255 --> 01:57:24.356]  But by their yardstick, yes.
[01:57:26.243 --> 01:57:30.128]  Yeah, I mean, look, I resent that insinuendo, as they used to say.
[01:57:30.488 --> 01:57:32.210]  But that is the reasoning of the left.
[01:57:32.291 --> 01:57:34.173]  It's all guilt by association.
[01:57:34.513 --> 01:57:40.641]  Because you know A, and you met B, then you must have discussed the assault on the Capitol.
[01:57:41.001 --> 01:57:41.923]  It's completely true.
[01:57:41.963 --> 01:57:42.984]  Let me say it for the 900th time.
[01:57:44.285 --> 01:57:54.754]  Any claim, assertion, or implication that I knew about, or was involved in, or condoned the illegal acts in January 6th, or any other date, is categorically false.
[01:57:54.794 --> 01:57:59.798]  And I know, because I know you, that you had nothing to do with this, and that you condemned it.
[01:58:00.038 --> 01:58:07.564]  Well, but Roger, but I mean, any moron, which makes me mad at some of the groups that did get involved in this, LARPing to get attention is what happened.
[01:58:08.405 --> 01:58:10.607]  The worst thing that could happen was attack the Capitol.
[01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:11.888]  Why the hell would we do that?
[01:58:12.188 --> 01:58:14.510]  We wanted a 10-day investigation of the Constitution.
[01:58:14.851 --> 01:58:18.474]  Like, why would I pour gasoline on myself and light myself on fire?
[01:58:18.714 --> 01:58:21.036]  Like, you robbed the bank to get the money, or you whatever.
[01:58:21.416 --> 01:58:23.098]  Like, we're not idiots.
[01:58:23.178 --> 01:58:25.600]  We don't have a motive to attack the Capitol.
[01:58:26.721 --> 01:58:27.602]  That's the first part.
[01:58:27.642 --> 01:58:31.185]  You see, to accuse us of that is to accuse us of stupidity.
[01:58:31.758 --> 01:58:33.700]  We're a lot of things, but we're not stupid.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:38.304]  I've seen the video of you jump up with a bullhorn and tell people, no, pull back.
[01:58:38.464 --> 01:58:40.285]  This is a peaceful demonstration.
[01:58:40.786 --> 01:58:47.652]  So this whole leftist idea that A knows B, who knows C, and that proves nothing whatsoever.
[01:58:47.672 --> 01:58:48.673]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:58:48.693 --> 01:58:54.298]  Yeah, it's like if my neighbor kills his wife, just because I know the neighbor doesn't mean I'm a suspect.
[01:58:55.138 --> 01:58:56.438]  How do you think this ends?
[01:58:56.458 --> 01:58:58.759]  Because you said this morning, this is desperation.
[01:58:59.379 --> 01:59:00.259]  This is desperation.
[01:59:00.279 --> 01:59:04.220]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:06.421]  They have no issues going into the next election.
[01:59:07.081 --> 01:59:15.083]  I would not be shocked to see them try to suspend or postpone the elections for some fraudulent national security reason.
[01:59:15.163 --> 01:59:16.043]  Power outage?
[01:59:17.230 --> 01:59:17.630]  Whatever.
[01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:23.213]  They know that they are going to lose if we can even get an honest count, which is a legitimate question.
[01:59:23.533 --> 01:59:27.295]  And I still believe that the answer is not taking Republican control of both houses.
[01:59:27.655 --> 01:59:28.975]  That's not going to change anything.
[01:59:29.376 --> 01:59:43.282]  But the election of a subset of patriots, a subset of real solid men and women who are America first constitutionalists in both houses, a group of 20 in the House, I believe, a group of four in the Senate, can change the course of history.
[01:59:43.682 --> 01:59:55.908]  Exactly, that caucus, that House caucus in the House and Senate could then on policies like Ron Paul used to do, only vote on issues, but now we have a hundred Ron Pauls, we could do it.
[01:59:57.149 --> 02:00:00.070]  Let me tell you the difference between a caucus and a cactus.
[02:00:00.230 --> 02:00:01.211]  You know the difference, Alex?
[02:00:02.091 --> 02:00:04.072]  In a cactus, all the pricks are on the outside.
[02:00:05.773 --> 02:00:07.934]  So what would you call this group, just patriots?
[02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:10.552]  I think it's an America First group.
[02:00:10.772 --> 02:00:12.574]  You send Laura Loomer to Congress.
[02:00:12.614 --> 02:00:14.836]  You send Mike Crispy to Congress.
[02:00:14.856 --> 02:00:15.776]  You send J.R.
[02:00:15.816 --> 02:00:17.017]  Majewski to Congress.
[02:00:17.337 --> 02:00:20.540]  They're not taking orders from Kevin McCarthy.
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.142]  You send Jackson Lawmire to the Senate.
[02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:26.144]  You send Alex Gray to the Senate.
[02:00:26.425 --> 02:00:28.086]  You're going to see a real change.
[02:00:28.146 --> 02:00:30.308]  And that's why they're so scared of MTG.
[02:00:30.468 --> 02:00:33.290]  She's the example of a maverick who won't take orders.
[02:00:34.732 --> 02:00:35.433]  Absolutely true.
[02:00:35.814 --> 02:00:37.155]  Alex, great to be back with you.
[02:00:37.235 --> 02:00:37.956]  God bless you.
[02:00:38.296 --> 02:00:45.143]  Folks, grab an InfoWars product, and while you're at it, go to StoneColdTruths.com and keep up with what the Stones are doing.
[02:00:45.183 --> 02:00:46.905]  And let's talk about Officer Greco real quick.
[02:00:46.925 --> 02:00:47.766]  People can support him.
[02:00:47.806 --> 02:00:48.307]  How do they do that?
[02:00:49.522 --> 02:00:54.366]  They go to HelpThisNYCop.com.
[02:00:54.667 --> 02:00:57.389]  He's gonna have to mount a lawsuit against NYPD.
[02:00:57.569 --> 02:01:00.091]  We're gonna put Mayor Adams on the stand and roast him.
[02:01:00.432 --> 02:01:03.054]  Please go to HelpThisNYCop.com.
[02:01:03.114 --> 02:01:03.695]  God bless you.
[02:01:03.715 --> 02:01:04.315]  All right, Roger.
[02:01:04.355 --> 02:01:04.676]  Thank you.
[02:01:04.716 --> 02:01:06.357]  Go say respects to your parents.
[02:01:06.397 --> 02:01:06.938]  We appreciate you.
[02:01:06.958 --> 02:01:07.858]  We'll be right back with calls.
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:11.021]  These dictators are a joke, aren't they?
[02:01:12.843 --> 02:01:13.824]  Here we are, my friends.
[02:01:15.660 --> 02:01:19.644]  Let's go ahead and take your phone calls right now, in the order they've been received.
[02:01:19.724 --> 02:01:20.164]  Johnny!
[02:01:21.365 --> 02:01:23.787]  Johnny in California, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:01:24.608 --> 02:01:29.673]  Alex, yes sir, I wanted to let you know what I think of the power structures of the planet, in my belief.
[02:01:30.273 --> 02:01:39.782]  I want to say that at the top of it, I think of it in terms of a triangle and a pyramid, and at the top you're going to have the central banks, and that power is going to come down to the United Nations.
[02:01:40.662 --> 02:01:43.864]  And that power is going to come down into the massive corporations of the planet.
[02:01:44.364 --> 02:01:45.945]  You name them, we have them.
[02:01:46.345 --> 02:01:55.089]  And after that, the corporations, it's the bureaus, which is the, you know, anything, any type of bureau.
[02:01:55.629 --> 02:02:03.373]  And after that, it's going to be the institutions, which are all your colleges and all your universities.
[02:02:03.393 --> 02:02:03.373]  100%.
[02:02:04.354 --> 02:02:05.994]  That's the New World Order model.
[02:02:06.014 --> 02:02:06.615]  Take over everything.
[02:02:06.635 --> 02:02:07.075]  Damn right.
[02:02:07.788 --> 02:02:08.168]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:08.188 --> 02:02:10.209]  And then after that, I just wanted to finish the rest of it.
[02:02:10.929 --> 02:02:16.191]  After that, the institutions, it's going to be the academia, all our education system.
[02:02:17.131 --> 02:02:23.873]  And then after that, the power structure controls the household and then the individual after that.
[02:02:24.073 --> 02:02:25.374]  Yeah, the social credit score.
[02:02:26.576 --> 02:02:29.559]  That's how the power structure, in my opinion, is going to come down the pipes here.
[02:02:29.579 --> 02:02:31.741]  It's going to come down from the central banks to the UN.
[02:02:32.081 --> 02:02:43.431]  In between that's going to be the Trilateral Commission and all the think tanks making the decisions for the policy to come through to the corporations so that the corporate policy comes through to the bureaus and it gets through to the institutions.
[02:02:44.332 --> 02:02:54.252]   And the institutions, you know, let everybody know what What's going to happen, and that's how it all comes down to the household, and that's how the individual, in my opinion, is going to be controlled.
[02:02:54.713 --> 02:02:59.876]  And that's the official New World Order social credit score plan being announced with a demo script.
[02:02:59.896 --> 02:03:00.556]  You're damn right.
[02:03:00.957 --> 02:03:06.360]  How do we get the average person to understand everything else you do doesn't matter if you don't stop this.
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:15.246]  And we do it through our states, our cities, our towns, and the federal government that are firewalls against the globalists and against this corporate dictatorship.
[02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:22.495]  Yes, I would say that we would just want to control the counties and control the sheriffs and make sure that everybody takes control of their state.
[02:03:23.376 --> 02:03:29.221]  And, you know, make sure, because the states are being vacuumed right now, pretty much, through the legislature.
[02:03:29.241 --> 02:03:29.721]  It's corporate.
[02:03:29.741 --> 02:03:31.623]  Oh yeah, they're putting all their people in.
[02:03:32.203 --> 02:03:33.124]  All the major cities.
[02:03:33.144 --> 02:03:33.864]  Great point, Johnny.
[02:03:33.884 --> 02:03:34.505]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:35.105 --> 02:03:36.887]  Alright, let's take another great caller here.
[02:03:37.427 --> 02:03:39.169]  Let's go ahead and talk to Greg in Florida.
[02:03:39.209 --> 02:03:40.089]  Greg, thanks for calling.
[02:03:41.711 --> 02:03:42.712]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[02:03:42.932 --> 02:03:44.373]  Man, I'm good being talking to you, brother.
[02:03:44.393 --> 02:03:45.434]  Every day on air is a blessing.
[02:03:46.209 --> 02:03:48.411]  Hey, I tell you what, I'm glad your health is okay.
[02:03:49.271 --> 02:03:50.712]  Yeah, I didn't mean to get it, I didn't know what it was.
[02:03:50.752 --> 02:03:54.715]  I was dizzy, and it turned out it was a sinus infection.
[02:03:54.755 --> 02:03:55.516]  It wasn't my heart.
[02:03:55.896 --> 02:03:58.057]  I had all these tests done, and I finally figured it out, yeah.
[02:03:58.918 --> 02:04:00.039]  Good, stay hydrated.
[02:04:00.139 --> 02:04:02.841]  I just never had vertigo.
[02:04:03.001 --> 02:04:04.022]  Man, that sucks.
[02:04:04.922 --> 02:04:05.823]  That's scary stuff.
[02:04:05.883 --> 02:04:07.604]  I didn't want to say on air what it was, or like, you know.
[02:04:08.024 --> 02:04:12.848]  Because vertigo, you can have vertigo and stuff from heart problems, but it was an infection, so I'm better now.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:14.380]  Good, good.
[02:04:14.621 --> 02:04:16.302]  Hey, a couple things.
[02:04:16.362 --> 02:04:28.352]  Last time I talked to you, real brief, a couple weeks ago before you went to L.A., you know, you mentioned, I'm the guy that, we started talking about a company I used to own called Laser Tech.
[02:04:28.812 --> 02:04:30.293]  I remember, I meant to call you, yeah.
[02:04:30.894 --> 02:04:42.223]  Okay, and so let me touch on something real quick that I wanted to mention back then, because we were talking about these wars, you know, this thing with these wars, how the wars break out and things like that.
[02:04:43.198 --> 02:04:49.341]  Uh, you know, I have, you know, everything I'm telling you, I could, I could back up with documentation, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:04:49.962 --> 02:04:56.905]  I have real documents from the official house that you're familiar with that, um, with their seal on there.
[02:04:57.686 --> 02:05:05.970]  Uh, when George Bush Senior first went into, uh, Kuwait, uh, over there to do that little one, do that war over there, that was a catastrophe.
[02:05:06.010 --> 02:05:09.331]  It was just a moneymaker for, uh, for all of his friends.
[02:05:10.212 --> 02:05:12.196]   Um, That was laid out.
[02:05:12.396 --> 02:05:28.073]  I have paperwork, probably two inches thick, of how that was war-gamed all the way down to each and every tank that was ever over there in the sand.
[02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:31.577]  That was done four and a half years ago before anyone took action.
[02:05:33.809 --> 02:05:39.037]  The other thing, you know, there's a lot of pieces that you could see out there that were put together like when Obama came in.
[02:05:39.598 --> 02:05:54.529]   You know, I was telling you my company, my chief scientist, Alan Hill, who developed and directed Star Wars under the Reagan administration, Uh, you know, people don't realize, you know, when Obama was in office, what was he doing?
[02:05:54.689 --> 02:06:00.292]  One of the main things he was doing that that I really took note of was he was defunding the Star Wars.
[02:06:00.732 --> 02:06:03.373]  OK, so OK, so you take that into effect.
[02:06:03.753 --> 02:06:04.734]  Now you start adding up.
[02:06:05.274 --> 02:06:06.335]  Pieces and pieces.
[02:06:06.415 --> 02:06:08.277]  Now you're seeing something.
[02:06:08.757 --> 02:06:10.318]  You're saying it's the takedown on the U.S.
[02:06:10.338 --> 02:06:15.262]  That's why they attacked Trump for Space Force saying, oh, what's Space Force?
[02:06:15.322 --> 02:06:16.784]  No, that's our most powerful weapon.
[02:06:17.404 --> 02:06:18.245]  And it's already there.
[02:06:18.345 --> 02:06:19.826]  Trump was giving a name to refund it.
[02:06:20.006 --> 02:06:20.527]  Exactly.
[02:06:21.167 --> 02:06:21.648]  Everything.
[02:06:21.668 --> 02:06:23.729]  Look, everything they're doing is to destroy America.
[02:06:24.190 --> 02:06:26.692]  And this thing on Putin, these sanctions only help Putin.
[02:06:27.633 --> 02:06:28.433]  And let me tell you something.
[02:06:28.813 --> 02:06:32.897]  And this stuff now that they're talking about, Alex, with fertilizer.
[02:06:33.874 --> 02:06:35.214]  You know, that's a joke.
[02:06:35.535 --> 02:06:43.497]  Okay, yeah, Russia is, I know for a fact Russia is the world's largest producer of DAP and fertilizer, okay?
[02:06:43.637 --> 02:06:49.820]  In 1991, I was bidding against Russia for the country of India.
[02:06:50.080 --> 02:06:58.062]  They contract, they won a contract for 80,000 metric tons of DAP diammonium phosphate, which is urea.
[02:06:58.823 --> 02:07:01.524]  Every country's different how it's formulated for the fertilizer.
[02:07:03.667 --> 02:07:08.871]  I beat out Russia, not on price, but how I beat them.
[02:07:08.730 --> 02:07:11.331]  And they even hit a satellite office in Bombay.
[02:07:11.331 --> 02:07:12.530]  You know, we're doing this tomorrow.
[02:07:12.530 --> 02:07:15.291]   I'm doing at least three hours live tomorrow with a bunch of calls.
[02:07:15.291 --> 02:07:16.291]  I got a special guest.
[02:07:16.291 --> 02:07:17.770]  I know you are and who your company is.
[02:07:17.770 --> 02:07:18.770]  I know you're for real.
[02:07:18.770 --> 02:07:22.050]   Last time we didn't do this, but I'm going to get your name and number now.
[02:07:22.050 --> 02:07:23.050]  We'll give you our email.
[02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:24.050]  Send us talking points.
[02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:26.331]  I want to do at least 30 minutes with you tomorrow.
[02:07:26.665 --> 02:07:27.926]  Greg, I want Greg on the show, guys.
[02:07:27.966 --> 02:07:29.747]  So I'm going live 1 to 4.
[02:07:29.787 --> 02:07:32.768]  We've got a guest at 3.
[02:07:33.248 --> 02:07:35.830]  Maybe he should come on like at 2.30 or something.
[02:07:38.431 --> 02:07:41.352]  So the guest is 3 to 4.
[02:07:42.052 --> 02:07:45.274]  Please come on the show tomorrow for 30 minutes, brother, so you can lay all this out.
[02:07:45.334 --> 02:07:46.114]  Put Greg on hold.
[02:07:46.154 --> 02:07:46.855]  Don't hang up on him.
[02:07:46.875 --> 02:07:47.115]  Thanks.
[02:07:48.574 --> 02:07:49.374]  I want to hear this.
[02:07:50.055 --> 02:07:51.555]  People need to hear the history of this.
[02:07:51.575 --> 02:07:52.175]  This is important.
[02:07:52.595 --> 02:07:53.776]  So we'll get him on the show tomorrow.
[02:07:53.796 --> 02:07:54.856]  Don't hang up on Greg, please.
[02:07:55.476 --> 02:07:57.537]  Okay, who's up next here holding the longest?
[02:07:58.637 --> 02:08:04.059]  That would be Bone Crusher in FEMA Region 10.
[02:08:04.099 --> 02:08:05.119]  Go ahead, Bone Crusher.
[02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:14.862]  Well, Alex, for anybody keeping score out there, let's chalk up another one for you because you said that there would be starvations.
[02:08:16.299 --> 02:08:24.288]  And food shortages, and they haven't said starvation yet, but David... Oh, they're having a broken clock, but not because they said that's their plan.
[02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.849]  Yeah.
[02:08:25.590 --> 02:08:29.614]  Yeah, there are gonna be food shortages now, and so you... Not a broken clock, a broken record.
[02:08:29.634 --> 02:08:30.175]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:08:30.879 --> 02:08:33.022]  Yeah, you said this about the war and everything, too.
[02:08:33.102 --> 02:08:36.906]  So, I mean, I don't know why people even watch mainstream media anymore.
[02:08:37.507 --> 02:08:42.373]  All they do is cover stuff that's going on right now, and they don't even cover it through a false lens anyway.
[02:08:42.433 --> 02:08:44.476]  So, I don't know why people even listen to them anymore.
[02:08:44.496 --> 02:08:46.338]  Because it's too scary to know the truth, brother.
[02:08:46.398 --> 02:08:48.661]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[02:08:48.681 --> 02:08:49.482]  What do you think is coming next?
[02:08:49.522 --> 02:08:50.223]  How do we stop this?
[02:08:52.046 --> 02:08:55.309]  Uh, well, we need to get people in there that are going to start fighting for us.
[02:08:55.369 --> 02:08:58.652]  Like, I think Trump was great, but Trump was like an all offense guy.
[02:08:58.693 --> 02:08:59.974]  You got to have somebody in there.
[02:09:00.334 --> 02:09:02.276]  You got to have people that are going to help with the defense.
[02:09:02.356 --> 02:09:04.678]  You know, like you just went and interviewed Mike Tyson.
[02:09:04.738 --> 02:09:13.446]  Everybody thinks of him as an offensive juggernaut, which he was, but the reason Mike Tyson was great and a champion, Mike Tyson had some of the best defense that a heavyweight has ever had.
[02:09:13.567 --> 02:09:15.288]  It was, that's why he was great.
[02:09:15.889 --> 02:09:18.479]   And the defense for Trump, No, you're right, brother.
[02:09:18.499 --> 02:09:19.300]  You're absolutely right.
[02:09:19.199 --> 02:09:22.559]   you and Roger but they're taking you guys out and they're trying to censor
[02:09:22.559 --> 02:09:25.679]   you guys and they're trying to do all that so we got to get people in there
[02:09:25.679 --> 02:09:30.298]   they're gonna fight for us not Mitch the bitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham and
[02:09:30.298 --> 02:09:32.920]   these other people that just say something every now and then so they can
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:36.679]   still act like they're a Republican that aren't really really a Republican but
[02:09:36.679 --> 02:09:39.519]   you said you got to get MTG and these people that are really gonna fight for
[02:09:39.519 --> 02:09:46.260]   it now you're right brother you're absolutely right what else
[02:09:46.260 --> 02:09:53.139]   is on your mind I just everything that's going on right now I think
[02:09:53.139 --> 02:09:56.568]   well I think Roger was right earlier when he said that what Trump is doing right
[02:09:56.568 --> 02:10:01.199]   now that it's a complete PR move and it is it's not
[02:09:59.351 --> 02:10:00.291]  It's not a good legal move.
[02:10:00.311 --> 02:10:01.631]  You're wasting your time.
[02:10:02.251 --> 02:10:05.412]  We can't even get courts or juries now that are going to help us.
[02:10:05.452 --> 02:10:10.973]  Like, if you look at what, even if you get a judge that you think is going to help you, they're just going to do something crazy.
[02:10:11.013 --> 02:10:12.553]  Like, do you remember the Epstein case?
[02:10:12.633 --> 02:10:17.474]  I can't remember what her name was or anything, but she was a female judge on an Epstein case, and her whole family got killed.
[02:10:18.160 --> 02:10:20.962]  That's right, now that's what they do.
[02:10:21.002 --> 02:10:24.965]  It's all, exactly, they're not just bribing these people, they're threatening to kill them.
[02:10:25.846 --> 02:10:27.447]  And that's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:10:27.487 --> 02:10:28.968]  Thank you so much, I appreciate you.
[02:10:29.789 --> 02:10:30.569]  Amazing points.
[02:10:30.730 --> 02:10:36.054]  Alright, up next, Ian, Larry, Wayne, and Ben.
[02:10:36.774 --> 02:10:40.774]  In the next two segments, then, Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:10:40.774 --> 02:10:52.774]  [Music]
[02:10:52.774 --> 02:10:56.774]   You know, it's a fact, and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true,
[02:10:56.774 --> 02:11:01.774]   that Infowars is seen by the globalists as the standard of human liberty,
[02:11:01.774 --> 02:11:09.774]   as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist, anti-human program.
[02:11:10.496 --> 02:11:17.562]  And man, our work is really, right now, hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[02:11:17.642 --> 02:11:24.427]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:11:24.468 --> 02:11:27.170]  And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[02:11:27.570 --> 02:11:32.054]  And so now we need the support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[02:11:32.094 --> 02:11:33.155]  Don't need me to tell you that.
[02:11:34.175 --> 02:11:35.675]  at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:11:35.675 --> 02:11:39.574]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[02:11:39.574 --> 02:11:45.014]   Things have been sold out for a long time, like Infowars Life, Fizzy Magnesium Mix that's so amazing,
[02:11:45.014 --> 02:11:48.494]  and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[02:11:48.494 --> 02:11:53.373]   They're all available 25 to 75% off at Infowarsstore.com right now.
[02:11:53.373 --> 02:12:00.894]   Zelensky recently described Putin's denazification of Ukraine as laughable.
[02:12:01.583 --> 02:12:06.326]  And the brainwashed flock of the mainstream media certainly must agree.
[02:12:07.066 --> 02:12:11.649]  They have been told that Nazis wave the American flag and vote Republican.
[02:12:12.049 --> 02:12:15.452]  And the brainwashed flock always believe what they are told.
[02:12:16.232 --> 02:12:25.463]  But those of us still cleaving to our sanity remember that Nazis were members of Hitler's National Socialist Party from the 1930s and 40s.
[02:12:26.324 --> 02:12:32.771]  And not only were there thousands of Nazis in Western Ukraine back then, it is still a big part of their national pride.
[02:12:33.832 --> 02:12:48.623]  Nazi war criminal Stepan Bandera is a national hero, and there are actual Nazi organizations still thriving in Ukraine, including the Azov Regiment, which is now a part of Ukraine's armed forces.
[02:12:49.844 --> 02:12:57.609]  The Nazification of Ukraine is well documented and easily verified, as is the Nazification of America.
[02:12:59.230 --> 02:13:08.592]  During the 1930s, there were many notable Americans who supported the Nazis, such as Prescott Bush, Henry Ford, and Fred Koch.
[02:13:09.253 --> 02:13:12.333]  Banks such as JP Morgan and Chase Manhattan.
[02:13:12.953 --> 02:13:18.255]  Companies such as General Motors, Standard Oil, Shell, and IBM.
[02:13:19.495 --> 02:13:22.098]  Major General Smedley Butler of the U.S.
[02:13:22.138 --> 02:13:28.945]  Marines was asked by these powerful entities to help them install National Socialism in the United States.
[02:13:29.445 --> 02:13:42.118]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee, the highest representation of the American people under its subpoena, to tell what I knew of activities which I believe might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[02:13:42.738 --> 02:13:49.203]  I was supposed to lead an organization of 500,000 men, which would be able to take over the functions of government.
[02:13:49.824 --> 02:13:56.469]  And when that plan failed, war broke out in Europe with the support of the banks and these American corporate entities.
[02:13:57.730 --> 02:14:02.514]  After World War II, only about a dozen were brought to justice at the Nuremberg Trials.
[02:14:03.075 --> 02:14:11.642]  The Catholic Church and the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis evade capture via the rat lines, which brought them mostly to South America.
[02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:14.645]  ...where they built an entire town in Argentina.
[02:14:15.686 --> 02:14:21.451]  In Operation Paperclip, the United States secretly absorbed thousands of Nazis into the U.S.
[02:14:21.491 --> 02:14:30.000]  government, where they led the NASA space program and helped pioneer the military-industrial complex, as well as Big Pharma.
[02:14:31.401 --> 02:14:40.109]  Many believe that being a Nazi is synonymous with being anti-Jewish, which may have been true in 1930s Germany, but it's complicated.
[02:14:40.769 --> 02:14:56.782]  Many high-ranking Nazis themselves, including Adolf Hitler, were Ashkenazi Jews, who can be traced back to the notorious Khazars, who mysteriously mass-converted to Judaism about 1,300 years ago in the region now known as Ukraine.
[02:14:57.723 --> 02:15:01.144]  Ashkenazi Jews ran the political Zionist movement in Germany.
[02:15:01.925 --> 02:15:08.507]  And for several years, the Zionists were the only political party allowed to operate inside Germany by the Nazis.
[02:15:09.448 --> 02:15:14.170]  Both the Zionists and the Nazis wanted their own ethnically pure state.
[02:15:14.970 --> 02:15:24.314]  And for years before their final solution, the Nazis helped the Zionists in their efforts to establish the State of Israel within Palestine.
[02:15:25.374 --> 02:15:28.478]  It was far more complicated than mere racial hatred.
[02:15:29.679 --> 02:15:33.023]  Nazism can best be described as fascism.
[02:15:33.703 --> 02:15:35.605]  And fascism is godlessness.
[02:15:36.929 --> 02:15:43.234]  The word Nazi is a made-up slur, but the word fascist can be clearly defined.
[02:15:44.035 --> 02:15:50.940]  It stems from the Latin word fascis, which is a bundle of sticks banded together to form a deadly weapon.
[02:15:51.841 --> 02:15:57.585]  An old-school meme that represents the deadly power of an organized mob, a gang.
[02:15:58.966 --> 02:16:04.571]  When men lack a personal relationship with God, they inevitably band together out of fear.
[02:16:05.371 --> 02:16:11.797]  Submitting to the strongman for a small taste of dominance, they become just another beast in the jungle.
[02:16:12.517 --> 02:16:17.541]  And today, we can clearly see this fascist mentality in all of these godless groups.
[02:16:18.462 --> 02:16:29.391]  The woke, the Satanists, the transhumanists, and the genocidal mass murderers of the Great Reset are all merging together into one giant Foskys.
[02:16:30.492 --> 02:16:33.775]  Godless men and women banded together out of fear.
[02:16:34.936 --> 02:16:37.398]  Fascists serving the strongman.
[02:16:38.439 --> 02:16:41.642]  Spiritually speaking, these are the weakest among us.
[02:16:42.362 --> 02:16:45.965]  And so far, we are allowing them to destroy everything.
[02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:50.341]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:16:54.142 --> 02:16:55.682]  All right, folks, we're back live here.
[02:16:56.483 --> 02:16:57.763]  Jay Dyer's about to take over.
[02:16:58.783 --> 02:17:08.985]  We're going to talk to Larry, Wayne, Ian, Ben, and then we're going to hand the baton to Jay Dyer, who's ready to go with the deep intel the globalists don't want you to know.
[02:17:09.945 --> 02:17:14.926]  Going in the order the calls received, Ian and Virginia on The Hidden or The Occult.
[02:17:14.986 --> 02:17:15.346]  Welcome.
[02:17:17.165 --> 02:17:17.686]  Hi, Alex.
[02:17:18.526 --> 02:17:22.210]  I wish you good health and all the best with your ordeals.
[02:17:22.590 --> 02:17:23.251]  Thank you, brother.
[02:17:23.271 --> 02:17:24.051]  I appreciate you.
[02:17:25.533 --> 02:17:28.576]  Well, I had a couple of points, if I have time.
[02:17:29.797 --> 02:17:36.863]  One of the main points is you have said in the past that they show you what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:17:37.384 --> 02:17:42.909]  The main purpose of that is to make you complicit in the evil that they're perpetrating.
[02:17:44.170 --> 02:17:51.395]  Because your tolerance to evil becomes acceptance of evil, and it becomes the acquiescence to evil.
[02:17:51.415 --> 02:17:56.638]  So you have to be a willing participant in their crimes and in their sin.
[02:17:57.499 --> 02:18:07.085]  And by telling you that that's what they're doing, whether it's conscious, fully conscious to you or not, by participating, you are participating in their evil.
[02:18:09.227 --> 02:18:26.819]   The other point that I wanted to try to make Was that, I think the best thing that people can do is understand that their organization and their concentration of energy is their best tool in defeating this.
[02:18:27.659 --> 02:18:35.584]  Because the left, or the left-hand path, or whatever you choose to call them, their best weapon is their organization.
[02:18:36.204 --> 02:18:40.227]  That's how they have the judges packed and the institutions packed.
[02:18:40.836 --> 02:18:42.357]  So that they can work against us.
[02:18:42.777 --> 02:18:45.178]  Oh yeah, they're a unified cult, they admit that's their power.
[02:18:46.519 --> 02:18:48.060]  Absolutely, that's our power.
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:51.162]  And we have to start realizing that's our power too.
[02:18:51.182 --> 02:18:59.106]  That's why they're so scared about us organizing and getting together, because that just, they know we have right on our side, they know we're good, they can't stand it.
[02:19:00.467 --> 02:19:01.087]  Absolutely.
[02:19:01.768 --> 02:19:15.548]   And I think, I know this is difficult as a radio host to do, but if people could take 30 seconds of their time To concentrate in prayer, that would help everybody.
[02:19:16.809 --> 02:19:29.504]  If people would pray for God to show them their own way in life, how they need to make changes in their own life to serve God and do His will on this earth, that would be our best weapon, and to do it together.
[02:19:31.424 --> 02:19:35.786]  No, you're right, because God is a free will God, and we have to invite the co-pilot in.
[02:19:36.207 --> 02:19:38.328]  It's not like the devil that forces it on you.
[02:19:39.128 --> 02:19:41.589]  God's not trying to rape you like these leftist pedophiles.
[02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:46.472]  God is trying to get you to choose the right path and to join with God through free will.
[02:19:46.492 --> 02:19:47.212]  You're absolutely right.
[02:19:47.232 --> 02:19:51.695]  You've got to invite God in as the co-pilot, and you've got to accept those directives.
[02:19:51.735 --> 02:19:53.496]  God won't give you things that are too big.
[02:19:53.956 --> 02:19:55.657]  God wants to build you up and make you strong.
[02:19:57.458 --> 02:19:57.938]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:58.258 --> 02:19:59.979]  And may I say one more thing?
[02:20:00.526 --> 02:20:01.827]  Yeah, I gotta get the other callers, but go ahead.
[02:20:02.967 --> 02:20:08.050]  In Psalm 82, 6, it says, He are God's and the sons of God.
[02:20:08.631 --> 02:20:12.013]  And Christ also reiterates this in John 10, 34.
[02:20:12.453 --> 02:20:14.214]  I hear you, brother, and I appreciate your call.
[02:20:14.374 --> 02:20:15.575]  I'm committed to get to everybody.
[02:20:16.155 --> 02:20:19.017]  Okay, let's go to Larry in Florida.
[02:20:19.077 --> 02:20:19.437]  Go ahead.
[02:20:19.457 --> 02:20:22.238]  Hey, Alex.
[02:20:22.919 --> 02:20:23.199]  Welcome.
[02:20:24.369 --> 02:20:34.038]  Thank you very much for my call, and like a bunch of, like the previous callers, everybody is just really happy to hear that there was nothing serious with your health, Doc.
[02:20:34.159 --> 02:20:35.220]  Thank you, brother.
[02:20:35.240 --> 02:20:39.424]  Yeah, I was just a sinus infection, but I was dizzy, so everybody thought, well, he's a big guy.
[02:20:39.444 --> 02:20:40.565]  He must be having a heart problem.
[02:20:41.045 --> 02:20:42.766]  Yeah, well we need you in that pilot seat.
[02:20:43.226 --> 02:20:47.189]  A couple of comments, I'm going to try and be real quick, and then one suggestion.
[02:20:48.169 --> 02:20:55.714]  Commenting on the conversation with Roger, there's a theory there, or theme, you know, America first candidates.
[02:20:55.774 --> 02:21:01.017]  That's what we need to elect, and Roger's right on, not just any Republican.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:14.587]  And one other candidate, and in fact, Roger's actually helping on his campaign, is Martin Hyde, who is running in Florida against Vern Buchanan, District 16, trying to primary him.
[02:21:14.687 --> 02:21:19.550]  So, tough race, but he's got the right philosophy and the right approach.
[02:21:19.610 --> 02:21:21.912]  So just a quick observation on that.
[02:21:22.752 --> 02:21:31.057]  Two informational things I have read, and if you already know it, but there's been court rulings now in France.
[02:21:31.833 --> 02:21:39.378]  That insurance companies don't have to pay death benefits on folks that have taken the jab.
[02:21:39.818 --> 02:21:40.559]  Surprise!
[02:21:41.019 --> 02:21:53.527]  Because in most policies you have exclusions for suicide and apparently in a lot of policies you have exclusions for experimental medications or medical treatments.
[02:21:54.088 --> 02:22:03.979]   So just a heads up and the National Insurance That's right.
[02:22:04.139 --> 02:22:13.245]  We got a major depopulation operation going on.
[02:22:13.645 --> 02:22:14.406]  You can't deny it.
[02:22:14.426 --> 02:22:15.586]  I could talk to you for hours, Larry.
[02:22:15.606 --> 02:22:16.027]  Thank you.
[02:22:16.427 --> 02:22:18.308]  Got to cram in everybody before this segment ends.
[02:22:18.788 --> 02:22:22.491]  Wayne, we'll get to you next, but first it's Ben in Pennsylvania.
[02:22:22.531 --> 02:22:23.051]  Ben, welcome.
[02:22:25.140 --> 02:22:28.102]  Alex, you're definitely my brother from another mother.
[02:22:28.402 --> 02:22:28.942]  Love you, brother.
[02:22:28.962 --> 02:22:29.683]  What's on your mind?
[02:22:30.483 --> 02:22:31.964]  I want to thank you for everything you do.
[02:22:32.144 --> 02:22:34.965]  I definitely want to give a shout out to InfoWare Store.
[02:22:35.906 --> 02:22:46.051]  If you're not wearing an arrest Fauci t-shirt or an arrest Bill Gates sticker on the back of your vehicle, you're missing out on fun, laughs, and conversations with tons and tons of people.
[02:22:47.652 --> 02:22:50.454]  I just want to tell you, I've been awake for a long time.
[02:22:51.449 --> 02:23:02.477]  One of my good friends, Cobra helicopter pilot, from Johnstown, if you want to GPS it, you can see the Cobra helicopters, shot down Flight 93.
[02:23:02.757 --> 02:23:05.939]  So I've been awake for over 20 years.
[02:23:06.639 --> 02:23:08.080]  I'm so happy I found you.
[02:23:08.981 --> 02:23:10.402]  Been listening to you for a long time.
[02:23:10.942 --> 02:23:18.037]   The one thing that I want to ask you if you've ever heard about, we had a Private geriatric prison.
[02:23:18.557 --> 02:23:29.401]  I live in a very, very small town in Pennsylvania, and this prison only was in a town of 3,000 people, yet it housed 1,850 people.
[02:23:29.441 --> 02:23:34.643]  The second COVID came in, during the Trump administration, they shut it down.
[02:23:35.583 --> 02:23:36.023]  Totally.
[02:23:36.063 --> 02:23:37.544]  Flew out all the planes, everything.
[02:23:39.046 --> 02:23:51.938]  Last summer, we started seeing C-130 planes fly into our local small airport, and there's now 1,850 Afghan refugees living in a 3,000-person town.
[02:23:53.859 --> 02:23:54.860]  I've seen that report.
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:55.981]  It's crazy, isn't it, brother?
[02:23:58.003 --> 02:24:10.451]   And the other thing is, I hired a guy last year who was in the National Guard, And I asked him about his two-week stint during the summer, and I said, well, what do you do for the two weeks?
[02:24:10.511 --> 02:24:14.052]  And he's like, well, for me, it's been four weeks the last two years.
[02:24:14.112 --> 02:24:17.094]  I go to Northern Macedonia and train UN troops.
[02:24:17.894 --> 02:24:18.594]  And I'm like, what?
[02:24:18.614 --> 02:24:20.075]  And he's like, yeah.
[02:24:20.295 --> 02:24:21.676]  And I said, with our stuff?
[02:24:21.696 --> 02:24:22.556]  He's like, yeah.
[02:24:24.528 --> 02:24:25.209]  Never heard of that.
[02:24:25.749 --> 02:24:26.510]  National Guard.
[02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:28.673]  Brother, the globalists are busy beavers.
[02:24:28.733 --> 02:24:29.574]  Thanks for your intel.
[02:24:29.614 --> 02:24:30.174]  Thank you, Ben.
[02:24:30.675 --> 02:24:33.258]  Last caller before Jadar takes over.
[02:24:33.318 --> 02:24:34.139]  Wayne in Texas.
[02:24:34.159 --> 02:24:34.519]  Go ahead.
[02:24:36.121 --> 02:24:36.662]  Hello, Alex.
[02:24:36.702 --> 02:24:37.262]  How are you, sir?
[02:24:37.983 --> 02:24:38.424]  I'm great.
[02:24:38.444 --> 02:24:39.465]  Doing a live show tomorrow.
[02:24:39.525 --> 02:24:40.005]  I promise.
[02:24:40.186 --> 02:24:40.806]  1pm Central.
[02:24:41.966 --> 02:24:42.727]  That sounds good.
[02:24:42.988 --> 02:24:45.231]  Hey, I wanted to offer some comic relief.
[02:24:45.311 --> 02:24:55.244]  I know that you share a similar, you know, disturbing sentiment for something about Brian Stilter, you know, and what you might cast him for if you were going to do it for a movie.
[02:24:55.805 --> 02:24:58.249]  Now, with that being said, I don't believe in coincidences.
[02:24:58.849 --> 02:25:07.315]  To describe this quickly, my friend used to teach kids that had disabilities to defend themselves, and he'd drawn a face on a dummy once.
[02:25:07.776 --> 02:25:11.918]  Well, years later, the face on the dummy drew looked like Jerry Sandusky.
[02:25:12.679 --> 02:25:15.081]  Well, I was thinking about Brian Stelter.
[02:25:15.101 --> 02:25:20.885]  Something was always off about him, and I realized what it was the other day, and I've discovered his doppelganger.
[02:25:21.085 --> 02:25:25.788]  It's Jared Fogle, the guy from Subway that solicited a minor.
[02:25:27.156 --> 02:25:30.680]  Google his image, I kid you not, they could be the same person.
[02:25:31.861 --> 02:25:33.102]  Same smile, everything.
[02:25:33.463 --> 02:25:34.243]  It's disturbing.
[02:25:34.564 --> 02:25:35.425]  Crazy, brother.
[02:25:35.505 --> 02:25:36.365]  What else is on your mind?
[02:25:37.467 --> 02:25:38.227]  No, that's it.
[02:25:38.307 --> 02:25:39.469]  I just wanted to share that.
[02:25:40.129 --> 02:25:41.531]  You just can't make this stuff up.
[02:25:43.433 --> 02:25:43.913]  Unbelievable.
[02:25:43.933 --> 02:25:45.435]  Thank you, sir, and God bless you.
[02:25:47.497 --> 02:25:50.119]  We've got Jay Dyer and his special guest.
[02:25:51.101 --> 02:25:52.482]  that are about to take over.
[02:25:52.622 --> 02:25:53.523]  Let's put them on screen.
[02:25:53.543 --> 02:25:58.127]  A lot better to look at there than Humpty Dumpty.
[02:25:58.648 --> 02:26:00.049]  Also known as Brian Stilter!
[02:26:00.750 --> 02:26:04.693]  So Jay Dyer is about to take over and he is with Jay's Analysis.
[02:26:05.114 --> 02:26:06.575]  He's a best-selling author and more.
[02:26:06.615 --> 02:26:07.796]  He's got a lot to cover.
[02:26:08.317 --> 02:26:09.938]  I always love listening on Fridays when he's here.
[02:26:10.358 --> 02:26:17.465]  So Jay Dyer takes over and then in T-minus 45 minutes, the great Owen Troyer with the War Room.
[02:26:18.783 --> 02:26:20.184]  That is 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:20.504]  Central.
[02:26:20.564 --> 02:26:22.344]  And tomorrow, I'm going to be here for this one.
[02:26:22.384 --> 02:26:25.926]  I missed the other day because I was sick.
[02:26:25.946 --> 02:26:26.546]  1 p.m.
[02:26:26.626 --> 02:26:29.307]  to 4 p.m., three-hour live show with special guests.
[02:26:30.967 --> 02:26:32.368]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:32.428 --> 02:26:33.909]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:26:33.969 --> 02:26:38.730]  I noticed that Jared Fogle image, he had some pretty nasty, stank yellow teeth going on.
[02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:40.511]  I think he needs some of that coral calcium.
[02:26:41.109 --> 02:26:42.650]  That you can get in the InfoWars store.
[02:26:43.070 --> 02:26:46.173]  So head on over there to support the InfoWars by getting all of your products there.
[02:26:46.293 --> 02:26:48.774]  I've been using the Coral Calcium, right?
[02:26:48.895 --> 02:26:51.456]  And my beautiful wife has actual white teeth.
[02:26:51.476 --> 02:26:54.579]  She has the whitest teeth, actually, in this household.
[02:26:54.599 --> 02:26:56.260]  That's been proven by a peer-reviewed study.
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:03.185]  Today we're going to be talking about the marriage, the alchemical wedding of pop culture and politics.
[02:27:03.945 --> 02:27:04.866]  And you titled this what?
[02:27:05.515 --> 02:27:06.395]  The world's a stage?
[02:27:06.415 --> 02:27:07.616]  The world's a stage, yeah.
[02:27:07.656 --> 02:27:11.818]  Shakespeare said the world's a stage and we are just players and today that's what we're going to talk about.
[02:27:12.298 --> 02:27:18.221]  So last week we were discussing what you might do a show about and you said, what's going on in the world?
[02:27:18.241 --> 02:27:19.261]  What's everyone talking about?
[02:27:19.302 --> 02:27:22.963]  And I said, they're all talking about how Kanye is treating Kim.
[02:27:23.664 --> 02:27:25.745]  And you said, oh, that's just a distraction.
[02:27:25.805 --> 02:27:27.225]  And I said, okay, okay.
[02:27:27.405 --> 02:27:28.586]  What's something serious?
[02:27:29.386 --> 02:27:32.768]  And I was thinking about Ukraine and Zelensky.
[02:27:33.659 --> 02:27:36.819]  And my brain went, well, wasn't he just an actor too?
[02:27:36.819 --> 02:27:39.600]  So that gave me an idea for a show.
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:45.918]   And to be fair, Kim, I mean, Kanye did run for president in 2020.
[02:27:45.887 --> 02:27:47.208]  Do you remember that?
[02:27:47.308 --> 02:27:49.128]  It was on my Yeezy ticket.
[02:27:49.188 --> 02:27:53.670]  Yes, he got 60,000 votes in the 12 states where he got on the ballot.
[02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:55.110]  So that's not too shabby, right?
[02:27:55.170 --> 02:28:01.792]  And then you got Kim Kardashian went to the Trump White House to talk about criminal justice reform.
[02:28:02.232 --> 02:28:04.073]  So they got their fingers in politics.
[02:28:04.533 --> 02:28:10.675]  But then I went and researched Vladimir Zelensky and his resume.
[02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:11.635]  So you want to hear about that?
[02:28:12.136 --> 02:28:12.396]  Sure.
[02:28:12.656 --> 02:28:12.916]  Okay.
[02:28:14.219 --> 02:28:16.120]  This is according to CNN.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.482]  In 2022, it says his acting career prepared him for the world stage.
[02:28:20.402 --> 02:28:24.225]  And Hollywood rallies around one of their own because he's an actor.
[02:28:24.685 --> 02:28:28.947]  So before he entered politics, he was a comedian, actor, writer.
[02:28:30.348 --> 02:28:35.310]  And he starred in a series called Servant of the People about a high school teacher who becomes president.
[02:28:37.512 --> 02:28:43.435]  He received recognition from Michael Keaton and others at the Screen Actors Guild Award for Fighting the Fight.
[02:28:44.468 --> 02:28:46.570]  So he's being honored by Hollywood.
[02:28:47.070 --> 02:28:49.692]  He co-wrote a male version of Sex and the City.
[02:28:50.973 --> 02:28:53.775]  He played Napoleon in a 2012 movie.
[02:28:54.536 --> 02:28:57.118]  He was the voice of Paddington Bear in Ukraine.
[02:28:58.339 --> 02:29:00.721]  He won Ukraine Dancing with the Stars in 2006.
[02:29:00.761 --> 02:29:03.163]  Do you know about that?
[02:29:03.203 --> 02:29:05.825]  So this is clearly a person that we should take serious, right?
[02:29:05.845 --> 02:29:07.286]  Yeah, this is a serious politician.
[02:29:08.817 --> 02:29:18.444]  Okay, so Servant of the People will air again alongside the documentary called Zelensky, The Man Who Took on Putin.
[02:29:18.464 --> 02:29:27.732]  He was in a 2014 music video parody where he was dancing in crop tops and 8-inch stiletto heels.
[02:29:27.752 --> 02:29:28.973]  I saw that beautiful thing, yes.
[02:29:29.013 --> 02:29:33.116]  Yes, it was a version of a song by Ukrainian Euro-pop boy band Kazakhi.
[02:29:34.594 --> 02:29:37.519]  And it was very beautiful and alluring.
[02:29:37.559 --> 02:29:40.304]  So every time I see that guy, I think Jeremy Renner.
[02:29:40.384 --> 02:29:46.614]  So somebody I couldn't tell if it was a joke or if they were being serious that Jeremy Renner was going to play another actor who's the president.
[02:29:46.934 --> 02:29:47.235]  Yeah.
[02:29:47.395 --> 02:29:48.777]  So it's very Inception-y.
[02:29:49.770 --> 02:29:50.030]  Right?
[02:29:50.130 --> 02:29:53.312]  Even that he played somebody that became the president.
[02:29:53.533 --> 02:29:55.694]  Just an everyday average Joe who became president.
[02:29:55.754 --> 02:29:59.156]  Well, this is not anything new when it comes to American politics.
[02:29:59.216 --> 02:30:04.680]  I mean, we've had countless, you know, people move from Hollywood to politics.
[02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:05.380]  Yes.
[02:30:05.921 --> 02:30:09.583]  And even vice versa, politics to Hollywood, back and forth.
[02:30:09.663 --> 02:30:12.145]  I mean, Reagan, obviously, that's a famous case.
[02:30:12.185 --> 02:30:31.839]   I remember reading that Reagan Uh, that they actually did a study and they figured out that if he and his wife transitioned from doing movies in Hollywood to politics, they would have a much better effect, especially garnering as a husband and wife team, you know, kind of the lion's share of the so-called conservative market out there.
[02:30:31.959 --> 02:30:38.024]  So, you know, he went from being doing bedtime with Bonzo monkey movies to being the president.
[02:30:39.205 --> 02:30:48.992]  And then the last thing we have on Zelensky was John Ondrisk of Five for Fighting has released a new single dedicated to Zelensky called Can One Man Save the World?
[02:30:49.873 --> 02:30:50.454]  Is that a band?
[02:30:50.474 --> 02:30:51.174]  I don't know what that is.
[02:30:51.234 --> 02:30:52.595]  Five for Fighting, yeah, it's a band.
[02:30:52.795 --> 02:30:53.316]  Sounds like a...
[02:30:54.102 --> 02:30:54.722]  Sounds like a ban.
[02:30:55.262 --> 02:30:56.963]  Sounds like a ban I would never listen to.
[02:30:57.203 --> 02:31:00.604]  You mentioned actors who became politicians, and I have a whole list.
[02:31:00.624 --> 02:31:01.104]  Oh, you found some?
[02:31:01.124 --> 02:31:01.325]  Okay.
[02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:03.005]  So let's go down that really fast.
[02:31:03.025 --> 02:31:13.029]  So you said Ronald Reagan, who was governor and became president, Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, Jesse Ventura, governor of Minnesota, Sonny Bono, mayor of Palm Springs, and Congress.
[02:31:13.049 --> 02:31:19.291]  Well, you know, when it comes to Jesse Ventura, I was fighting the Predator, so you know I'm gonna do good as the governor.
[02:31:21.034 --> 02:31:23.319]  Clay Aiken, did you know he was in politics?
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:25.484]  Congressional candidate for North Carolina.
[02:31:26.566 --> 02:31:29.508]  Clint Eastwood was mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.
[02:31:29.968 --> 02:31:32.870]  Jerry Springer was on Cincinnati City Council.
[02:31:32.930 --> 02:31:36.191]  Shirley Temple was a congressional candidate and became an ambassador.
[02:31:36.271 --> 02:31:36.492]  Wow.
[02:31:36.872 --> 02:31:39.633]  George Takai was on the Los Angeles City Council.
[02:31:39.913 --> 02:31:40.614]  Oh my!
[02:31:40.694 --> 02:31:41.174]  There you go.
[02:31:41.794 --> 02:31:44.956]  Cynthia Nixon from Sex and the City ran for mayor of New York City.
[02:31:45.116 --> 02:31:46.397]  Al Franken became a senator.
[02:31:46.457 --> 02:31:49.398]  And Caitlyn Jenner was running for governor of California.
[02:31:49.418 --> 02:31:50.899]  And that's just the short list.
[02:31:50.939 --> 02:31:52.440]  There's a very much longer list.
[02:31:52.500 --> 02:31:53.441]  Is Bruce Jender, you mean?
[02:31:53.721 --> 02:31:53.881]  Yes.
[02:31:55.692 --> 02:32:02.093]  So this all goes back to the beginning of Hollywood with Louis B. Mayer in the 1920s.
[02:32:03.273 --> 02:32:09.895]  MGM, he actually was the one who brought the Republican Party to Hollywood to use movie stars to enhance the image of politicians.
[02:32:11.095 --> 02:32:13.675]  MGM became the publicity wing for the GOP.
[02:32:14.455 --> 02:32:18.716]  And this was the beginning of photo ops and glamour for politicians.
[02:32:19.116 --> 02:32:23.497]  So Mayer was actually the first person from Hollywood to spend the night in the White House.
[02:32:24.486 --> 02:32:46.423]  And this partnership became what they call cinematic politics and then in the 1930s became issue politics and Edward G. Robinson was an outspoken public critic of fascism and Nazism and demonstrated that a mobilized community of stars could use their celebrity to draw national attention to controversial issues of the day and sway public opinion.
[02:32:46.443 --> 02:32:47.704]  Oh yeah, see?
[02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:50.026]  Yeah, but he's always playing the organized crime figure.
[02:32:50.106 --> 02:32:50.547]  That's funny.
[02:32:50.627 --> 02:32:51.808]  Yes, the mobster guy.
[02:32:52.088 --> 02:32:54.109]  Yeah, he's always playing the mob guy.
[02:32:54.890 --> 02:33:04.656]  So this became movement politics, which becomes radical changes in pop culture because of the influence of celebrities and their household name.
[02:33:04.676 --> 02:33:15.321]   By the way, I would add to that this was also studied at the sociological level that they could utilize and sell pop figures as social engineering tools.
[02:33:15.321 --> 02:33:21.161]   So they're not just commodities or entities that make money, they're also social engineering tools.
[02:33:21.161 --> 02:33:24.760]   And that's why I think a lot of the pop stars have sort of auditioned themselves
[02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:27.440]  for different social causes nowadays.
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:32.001]   We see them become the face of a movement and that's because really they're just bought off to do
[02:33:32.001 --> 02:33:32.440]  that.
[02:33:32.440 --> 02:33:39.120]   Yes, so you've got Charlton Heston back in the day who uses his Moses persona and the trust that he gets
[02:33:39.120 --> 02:33:42.021]  from those kind of roles to influence elections.
[02:33:43.109 --> 02:33:47.516]  Ronald Reagan represented the new kind of politician for a new media and television age.
[02:33:48.821 --> 02:33:53.625]  And Arnold used pop media and movie quotes as slogans to get elected.
[02:33:54.145 --> 02:34:02.952]  So he would go on Entertainment Tonight and those kind of shows instead of 60 Minutes and the more serious shows because he knew that those kind of shows had more viewers.
[02:34:02.972 --> 02:34:03.893]  It's not a tumor!
[02:34:04.293 --> 02:34:06.094]  So this is... Is that what got him elected?
[02:34:06.154 --> 02:34:07.035]  It's not a tumor?
[02:34:07.055 --> 02:34:07.695]  Yeah, well he did.
[02:34:07.736 --> 02:34:13.203]   He's like, we're gonna blast them and Hasta la vista, baby!
[02:34:13.263 --> 02:34:14.604]  Right, so that was part of his campaign.
[02:34:14.624 --> 02:34:25.868]  Yeah, so movie quotes became political slogans, and this is where you can turn citizens doing their civic duty into fans who follow and adore, no matter what the policies are.
[02:34:26.708 --> 02:34:27.908]  Go watch a movie like Junior.
[02:34:27.948 --> 02:34:33.950]  That one's actually a really prophetic movie, because Arnold gives birth.
[02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:41.312]   Well, we're talking about movies like Wag the Dog, American Dreams, those kind of Those are political satires.
[02:34:41.332 --> 02:34:44.074]  Yes, political satires that go behind the scenes and show you some truth.
[02:34:44.795 --> 02:34:44.995]  Yeah.
[02:34:45.535 --> 02:34:53.001]  Well, in Wag the Dog, keep in mind, that was actually consulted on by Milt Bearden and Chase Brandon.
[02:34:53.021 --> 02:34:55.483]  Those were actual CIA guys consulting on the film.
[02:34:55.723 --> 02:34:58.743]   And I think if you Pay attention.
[02:34:58.783 --> 02:35:06.628]  You can see that Dustin Hoffman is playing that kind of a character director being consulted on by the Robert De Niro characters like the CIA sort of operative.
[02:35:06.648 --> 02:35:07.988]  Anyway, don't go anywhere.
[02:35:08.329 --> 02:35:13.492]  We are covering the marriage between Hollywood and politics on The Alex Jones Show.

[02:36:07.045 --> 02:36:12.148]  And you had covered a few of the famous cases of Hollywood figures that came out of politics.
[02:36:12.968 --> 02:36:15.189]  What's this next point you want to make about Oprah?
[02:36:15.369 --> 02:36:20.792]  Well, this is so pervasive that it actually has a name and it's called the Oprah Effect.
[02:36:21.413 --> 02:36:41.783]   So a study on celebrity endorsements in the 2008 Obama elections concluded that Oprah's endorsement of Obama was responsible for over a million votes and she is the one who Got Obama to be the candidate over Hillary in 2008, primary.
[02:36:42.343 --> 02:36:49.708]  So her commercial landscape means that her influence exceeds any, that of any other celebrity in history.
[02:36:50.189 --> 02:36:53.551]  So if you want to get elected, Oprah is going to need to be in your pocket.
[02:36:54.111 --> 02:36:54.992]  Well, think about Oprah.
[02:36:55.692 --> 02:36:57.173]  Oprah's a good looking man.
[02:36:58.254 --> 02:37:00.355]  About as good looking as Michael.
[02:37:04.238 --> 02:37:04.778]  That was a joke.
[02:37:05.399 --> 02:37:07.940]  Traveling back in time... I don't actually think I'm Brisbane, I was gonna say.
[02:37:09.521 --> 02:37:09.922]  Big Mike.
[02:37:10.342 --> 02:37:15.925]  We have, do you remember in the 1970s, the Elvis and Nixon relationship?
[02:37:16.465 --> 02:37:30.733]  So in 1970, Elvis went to the White House with a letter to the President stating, I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing techniques, and I'm right in the middle of the whole thing where I can and will do the most good.
[02:37:32.008 --> 02:37:50.777]  So Presley, he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and to be named a federal agent at large because he loved badges and police work and detective work and he liked to collect honorary titles of important.
[02:37:50.837 --> 02:37:50.917]  Wow.
[02:37:50.937 --> 02:37:51.297]  That's wild.
[02:37:52.868 --> 02:38:00.812]  So he claimed to have been studying brainwashing and drug culture for over 10 years, and he knew a lot about this and was accepted by the hippies.
[02:38:01.592 --> 02:38:02.553]  These were his credentials.
[02:38:02.633 --> 02:38:02.953]  Wow.
[02:38:04.293 --> 02:38:15.018]  He was given an honorary badge, which he treated like the real thing, and his wife recalls that he used that badge as some kind of ultimate power to carry guns and drugs into any country he wanted.
[02:38:15.038 --> 02:38:15.478]  Oh, wow.
[02:38:15.538 --> 02:38:16.279]  That's crazy.
[02:38:16.339 --> 02:38:20.901]  And we all remember them using Elvis, joining the army.
[02:38:21.825 --> 02:38:22.448]  Right, yeah.
[02:38:22.568 --> 02:38:24.637]  Well, his handler was Colonel Tom, right?
[02:38:24.718 --> 02:38:24.818]  Yes.
[02:38:24.858 --> 02:38:25.823]  So he had a handler, too.
[02:38:26.869 --> 02:38:32.391]  And another strange thing about Elvis is he never went anywhere without a giant trunk of occult and esoteric books.
[02:38:32.551 --> 02:38:33.531]  Yes, I didn't know about this.
[02:38:33.571 --> 02:38:36.292]  In fact, he, towards the end, really got into theosophy.
[02:38:36.372 --> 02:38:46.474]  And so he was like trying to become this esoteric figure who, as I have read at least, he thought towards the end of his life that he was a sort of messianic person, like a new avatar.
[02:38:46.514 --> 02:38:49.195]  And that's very amenable to theosophy.
[02:38:49.755 --> 02:38:53.316]  And so he actually had this people around him that he thought were his twelve disciples.
[02:38:53.376 --> 02:39:01.746]   And so he had just kind of lost it and gone into And in my second book, I have a little chapter on Elvis.
[02:39:02.146 --> 02:39:11.620]  Like you said, he became an idol of worship and even some folklore around him that he didn't die.
[02:39:12.461 --> 02:39:12.621]  Hmm.
[02:39:12.801 --> 02:39:16.543]  That he's still around and influencing people and blessing them.
[02:39:17.763 --> 02:39:22.085]  So he was one of the first celebrities that was a supernatural idol.
[02:39:22.685 --> 02:39:22.865]  Hmm.
[02:39:23.345 --> 02:39:23.505]  Right?
[02:39:23.985 --> 02:39:30.748]  Yeah, well, I mean, it would be beneficial to create these kinds of legends like this, right, to help promote the lore and the arcana of Elvis.
[02:39:30.768 --> 02:39:32.809]  So I could see that being a PR move for sure.
[02:39:34.210 --> 02:39:35.992]  So then we have Katy Perry.
[02:39:36.853 --> 02:39:47.003]  Now this is a great one because this is really where we start to see the merger between democratic politics and pop culture on a just gigantic scale, right?
[02:39:47.023 --> 02:40:03.836]   I mean, I know there's always been this merger between these different realms and even going back to the 1950s or late 40s and early 50s, for example, I didn't know that about MGM but There was the case of the CIA being involved in the background in the production of The Day the Earth Stood Still.
[02:40:04.457 --> 02:40:11.540]  And so, I think it was Zanuck of 20th Century Fox actually brought in consultants and people like C.D.
[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:16.122]  Jackson who worked in the doctrinal warfare program to co-opt religion.
[02:40:16.602 --> 02:40:22.604]  They brought him in to consult and help craft this movie, which is one of the most famous, you know, science fiction movies of all time.
[02:40:22.644 --> 02:40:23.685]  It's total propaganda, right?
[02:40:23.705 --> 02:40:30.908]  It's all scientism, and Klaatu is basically this new scientism version of Jesus, and he's even called a carpenter and this kind of stuff.
[02:40:31.388 --> 02:40:33.049]  But he's a science Jesus, right?
[02:40:33.349 --> 02:40:36.370]  He's science Jesus, who's the new religious figure.
[02:40:36.390 --> 02:40:43.044]   And so they noticed that, you know, you can really craft Pop culture to be like a religion, and politics is the exact same way.
[02:40:43.064 --> 02:40:45.925]  It functions like a cult, and so the figures are like these cult leaders.
[02:40:46.145 --> 02:40:46.605]  Definitely.
[02:40:46.625 --> 02:40:53.488]  Well, Katy Perry has gone all out for the Democratic Party in both Obama and Hillary campaigns.
[02:40:53.608 --> 02:40:53.828]  Right.
[02:40:55.009 --> 02:41:04.473]  She hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008, and she was wearing a giant yellow dress emblazoned with Obama's larger-than-life face in sequence.
[02:41:04.833 --> 02:41:05.033]  Right.
[02:41:05.173 --> 02:41:06.774]  So, entire dress of Obama.
[02:41:08.035 --> 02:41:16.003]  Uh, and then in 2008, I mean, in 2012, she performed in Nevada in a white dress printed with a ballot checked for Obama and Biden.
[02:41:16.283 --> 02:41:17.124]  Do you remember that thing?
[02:41:18.305 --> 02:41:22.950]  Uh, she performed in Milwaukee in a blue dress printed with Obama's four word slogan.
[02:41:24.011 --> 02:41:27.775]  And then in 2013, she performed as a sexy Uncle Sam.
[02:41:28.281 --> 02:41:31.481]  for a children's concert for military families.
[02:41:31.481 --> 02:41:38.681]   And she really tried hard in 2016 by posting, "I'm with her," clothes and nails,
[02:41:38.681 --> 02:41:41.720]  and performing at all of Hillary's rallies.
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:47.161]   Yeah, well, I mean, it looks like this is a great example of, like, pop culture.
[02:41:47.419 --> 02:41:47.619]  Yes.
[02:41:47.659 --> 02:41:47.879]  Right.
[02:41:47.959 --> 02:42:00.281]  This is using the wedding of these two ceremonies, of these two domains into a mystical ceremony of the psychodrama, which is intended really to just mind control the public.
[02:42:00.361 --> 02:42:04.082]  So I think of a more helpful analogy would be like voodoo.
[02:42:04.242 --> 02:42:16.805]   It's like voodoo shamanism, basically, where the celebrities are like the voodoo, you know, performers and practitioners who sort of You know, they put a spell on you with this and then all the drones just sort of go along and go vote for whoever they say.
[02:42:17.146 --> 02:42:20.747]  Yes, and we did that show with Owen last year about high-profile rituals.
[02:42:20.927 --> 02:42:22.568]  So this goes exactly into that.
[02:42:23.248 --> 02:42:29.151]  They are inculcating the opinions of the Democrats and the left.
[02:42:30.045 --> 02:42:32.045]  into their performance.
[02:42:32.045 --> 02:42:38.045]   You know, this is I remember too, I went and watched a bunch of old 90s, early 90s MTV shows just for the heck of
[02:42:38.045 --> 02:42:38.045]  it.
[02:42:38.045 --> 02:42:44.045]   The other day I was doing some research on the 90s pop culture and I noticed in a lot of these MTV episodes,
[02:42:44.045 --> 02:42:48.045]   like the whole show was uploaded to YouTube with the commercials.
[02:42:48.045 --> 02:42:52.625]   And I started noticing all of these rock the vote commercials that I'd forgotten about because I grew up in
[02:42:52.625 --> 02:42:53.045]  the 90s.
[02:42:53.508 --> 02:42:57.229]  And you notice that it's all about like getting people out to vote for Bill Clinton, right?
[02:42:57.249 --> 02:43:05.953]  So the whole rock the vote thing was a marriage between the Democratic Party and MTV to promote basically the Democratic Party.
[02:43:07.213 --> 02:43:11.995]  Well, maybe in the next segment we will play a game called Democratic Convention or Coachella.
[02:43:14.756 --> 02:43:34.150]   Because they always use the Biggest pop stars of the day to influence people because they have... And they always pick the most annoying of the boomer rock stars too.
[02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:37.013]  Him, frickin, uh, what's his name?
[02:43:37.954 --> 02:43:39.715]  John Coomer Mellencamp, right?
[02:43:39.755 --> 02:43:39.915]  Yeah.
[02:43:44.682 --> 02:43:47.002]  By the way, vote for Obama, if you please.
[02:43:47.042 --> 02:43:50.583]  You should have seen the lineup of the 2021 inaugural concert.
[02:43:51.243 --> 02:43:52.784]  Well, tell me who's on this.
[02:43:52.924 --> 02:43:53.644]  Sounds terrible.
[02:43:53.924 --> 02:44:10.087]  Beyonce, Mary J. Blige, Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, John Mellencamp, Shakira, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Usher, Will.i.am, Stevie Wonder, Jennifer Hudson, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato, Katy Perry, Foo Fighters, and it was hosted by Tom Hanks.
[02:44:10.527 --> 02:44:10.887]  Oh, man.
[02:44:12.503 --> 02:44:14.405]  That wasn't just one concert, that was a couple of these.
[02:44:14.445 --> 02:44:19.350]  But all of these people, they are using to garner support for the Democratic Party.
[02:44:20.551 --> 02:44:27.959]  Well, the boss, he represents the working stiff, right?
[02:44:28.199 --> 02:44:30.602]  They're literally representing the working stiff.
[02:44:31.443 --> 02:44:31.743]  Right?
[02:44:31.883 --> 02:44:32.063]  Yeah.
[02:44:32.103 --> 02:44:35.626]  And he's wearing, like, cut-off sleeves and he's wearing jeans.
[02:44:35.906 --> 02:44:40.949]  Meanwhile, he's, like, being paid off by, like, global elites who want to destroy the country and make everybody poor.
[02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:43.730]  Go do what?
[02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:44.551]  Do Bon Jovi.
[02:44:46.012 --> 02:44:48.873]  Maybe when we come back, if you're good enough, I'll do Bon Jovi.
[02:44:48.893 --> 02:44:51.695]  I don't even know if I can do Bon Jovi, but we'll experiment.
[02:44:51.775 --> 02:44:53.036]  Alright, you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:53.056 --> 02:44:55.377]  This is Jay Dyer with Jamie Henshaw.
[02:44:55.397 --> 02:44:55.878]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:44:55.918 --> 02:44:56.438]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:57.307 --> 02:44:58.568]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:58.608 --> 02:45:03.252]  I'm your guest host, John Coomer Mellencamp from jaysanalysis.com.
[02:45:03.292 --> 02:45:05.434]  This is my wife, Jamie Henshaw.
[02:45:05.454 --> 02:45:25.794]   So, you were telling us about this horrible Coachella, I mean Democratic Party party involving all the pop stars and the ultimate sellouts, and you reminded me of In the WikiLeaks, remember this, it came out, right, that Hillary was telling the Colbert Show basically what to talk about, what to promote, and what to do.
[02:45:25.894 --> 02:45:27.376]  So we know that this goes on all the time.
[02:45:27.396 --> 02:45:32.079]  There's nothing, I mean, why do they all promote and rehash the Democratic Party line?
[02:45:32.239 --> 02:45:35.502]  Like literally all the pop stars, all the mainline networks and TV shows.
[02:45:35.562 --> 02:45:36.923]  It's just transparent, right?
[02:45:37.103 --> 02:45:37.283]  Yeah.
[02:45:37.905 --> 02:45:41.826]  This also reminded me of Obama and Beyonce and Jay-Z.
[02:45:41.926 --> 02:45:48.668]  They were very close throughout the entire eight years of Obama's presidency, taking vacations together.
[02:45:48.688 --> 02:45:54.389]  Beyonce and Jay-Z going to the White House many, many times, even to private parties and private birthday parties.
[02:45:55.049 --> 02:45:57.570]  So Obama and Beyonce were besties.
[02:45:58.554 --> 02:45:59.655]  Don Podesta there in that pit.
[02:45:59.675 --> 02:46:01.416]  Looks like he needs a little coral calcium too.
[02:46:01.436 --> 02:46:03.336]  He's got some nasty meth teeth going on.
[02:46:03.356 --> 02:46:03.396]  Ew.
[02:46:04.997 --> 02:46:06.578]  Steve Colbertus looks like a demon.
[02:46:08.699 --> 02:46:10.740]  So, yeah, well, tell us more about this.
[02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:13.761]  So, you went into Elmo?
[02:46:14.402 --> 02:46:27.345]   Well, in 2010, distinguished personality Elmo Grace the White House with his presence when he went to meet with First Lady Michelle Obama about healthy foods in school cafeterias.
[02:46:27.365 --> 02:46:29.027]  Oh Elmo like Big Mike!
[02:46:33.792 --> 02:46:39.978]  And they were trying to use Muppet stickers to sell fruit to children.
[02:46:40.058 --> 02:46:41.359]  So fruit, vegetables, produce.
[02:46:41.719 --> 02:46:44.222]  I wonder if this had anything to do with like GMO things.
[02:46:45.204 --> 02:46:45.884]  Oh, probably.
[02:46:45.944 --> 02:46:51.946]  I mean, yeah, I remember she was promoting this idea of healthy foods in school cafeterias.
[02:46:51.986 --> 02:46:54.687]  Of course, nothing of what she's promoting was actually healthy.
[02:46:54.727 --> 02:47:07.350]  I mean, I'm not saying fruits are necessarily bad, but I mean, fruits are just sugar, so... So, Elmo was there to talk about the importance of eating a regular... Well, she got a big bowl of frickin' oatmeal.
[02:47:07.931 --> 02:47:08.771]  Like, that's healthy.
[02:47:08.811 --> 02:47:12.152]  Like, a giant bowl of Trix, right?
[02:47:12.172 --> 02:47:12.712]  Like, that's healthy.
[02:47:14.199 --> 02:47:18.001]  They were talking about the importance of eating a rainbow of foods, they kept saying.
[02:47:18.021 --> 02:47:19.122]  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[02:47:19.482 --> 02:47:20.843]  Yeah, I wonder what that's about.
[02:47:20.863 --> 02:47:24.085]  So that is the importance of Elmo.
[02:47:24.105 --> 02:47:26.566]  Oh, Elmo likes Big Mike!
[02:47:26.586 --> 02:47:29.667]  Elmo and Big Mike were on Touchdown!
[02:47:31.008 --> 02:47:32.249]  Big Mike Linebacker!
[02:47:35.811 --> 02:47:38.372]  In 2017... You don't even know who Big Mike is?
[02:47:38.532 --> 02:47:39.973]  Yes, it's Michelle.
[02:47:39.993 --> 02:47:40.093]  Okay.
[02:47:42.603 --> 02:47:44.784]  Well, Alex is the one I heard saying Big Mike.
[02:47:44.804 --> 02:47:47.005]  Every time he says Big Mike, it cracks me up.
[02:47:47.025 --> 02:47:50.987]  The idea of Elmo talking about Big Mike is funny.
[02:47:52.747 --> 02:47:57.790]  So then you've got what I call Biden's besties, which is Lady Gaga.
[02:47:57.870 --> 02:48:03.252]  In 2017, her and her buddy, she calls Joe Biden, teamed up in a PSA.
[02:48:04.162 --> 02:48:06.102]  Urging action against sexual assault.
[02:48:06.222 --> 02:48:07.223]  So that's pretty ironic.
[02:48:07.323 --> 02:48:07.603]  Wow.
[02:48:07.863 --> 02:48:12.243]  Because she says she's a sexual assault survivor and she... Well, he's a sniffer.
[02:48:12.344 --> 02:48:13.704]  I mean... I know!
[02:48:13.724 --> 02:48:16.044]  What do you think Lady Gaga smells like?
[02:48:16.064 --> 02:48:17.044]  We could ask Joe Biden.
[02:48:17.064 --> 02:48:18.765]  Hey, come on, man.
[02:48:18.825 --> 02:48:19.725]  She smells like meat.
[02:48:19.805 --> 02:48:20.925]  Does she wear that meat suit?
[02:48:21.425 --> 02:48:22.485]  The OTO perfume.
[02:48:22.565 --> 02:48:24.926]  Smells like a steak, man.
[02:48:24.966 --> 02:48:25.766]  Come on, man.
[02:48:25.806 --> 02:48:27.246]  Smells like... No, she smells like a steak.
[02:48:28.106 --> 02:48:29.327]  Oh, because of her meat dress?
[02:48:29.767 --> 02:48:30.027]  Okay.
[02:48:30.307 --> 02:48:31.407]  But do you remember her perfume?
[02:48:32.944 --> 02:48:34.465]  Why would I remember Lady Gaga's perfume?
[02:48:34.485 --> 02:48:37.507]  Because it had blood and S-C-M-E-A.
[02:48:37.527 --> 02:48:38.928]  Oh, that's her Crowley perfume, right?
[02:48:38.948 --> 02:48:39.249]  Yeah.
[02:48:40.109 --> 02:48:41.010]  So she had her O.T.O.
[02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.390]  perfume.
[02:48:41.470 --> 02:48:43.632]  Want to smell like a dirty satanic coomer?
[02:48:44.392 --> 02:48:44.633]  Right.
[02:48:45.173 --> 02:48:47.455]  So Lady Gaga and Biden are besties.
[02:48:47.495 --> 02:48:49.456]  And guess who else is besties with Biden?
[02:48:49.476 --> 02:48:52.138]  I'm trying to think of the worst possible people.
[02:48:52.178 --> 02:48:52.358]  Who?
[02:48:52.698 --> 02:48:53.019]  Cardi B.
[02:48:54.614 --> 02:49:07.546]  So Cardi B teamed up with Joe Biden for a Zoom call for Elle magazine to chat about Cufid and about Trump and about police brutality and the upcoming 2020 election and how much she hated Trump.
[02:49:08.567 --> 02:49:12.951]  And she wanted everyone to vote for Biden because she cares about medical care.
[02:49:12.971 --> 02:49:18.736]  And her fans lined up to sing WAP at the White House.
[02:49:20.131 --> 02:49:23.672]  Well, we can't go into what that's about, but we all know what that's about.
[02:49:23.752 --> 02:49:36.694]  But to be fair, Cardi B also sat down with Bernie Sanders in a nail salon in Detroit to talk about politics, and Bernie's answers were much more cohesive than Biden's by far.
[02:49:36.814 --> 02:49:37.814]  Where's Cardi A?
[02:49:37.834 --> 02:49:39.694]  Are you the Cardi B?
[02:49:39.714 --> 02:49:41.795]  The backup, where's the Cardi A?
[02:49:42.415 --> 02:49:44.135]  Get the Federal Reserve out of here.
[02:49:44.375 --> 02:49:46.015]  Let's look at this, put a committee on it.
[02:49:46.355 --> 02:49:49.376]  Socialize Cardi B. There they are.
[02:49:50.584 --> 02:49:55.231]  Everyone deserves a piece of Cardi B. And bring back Cardi A, by the way.
[02:49:56.693 --> 02:50:01.701]  And our last celebrity of the day is Olivia Rodrigo.
[02:50:01.721 --> 02:50:03.584]  I don't even know who this pop star is.
[02:50:03.604 --> 02:50:04.405]  The new pop star.
[02:50:04.425 --> 02:50:06.208]  I don't even know who this is, but you told me about this.
[02:50:07.166 --> 02:50:26.133]  In July 2021, she visited the White House to talk to Dr. Fauci and Joe Biden to urge young people to get their stabs and how important it was for people under the age of 18 to get these because we care so much about our senior citizens and the people who are immunocompromised.
[02:50:26.713 --> 02:50:29.955]  I want to thank the pop star for being here with me.
[02:50:30.015 --> 02:50:35.677]  I don't remember her name, but be sure and get your black goo nano boosters.
[02:50:36.817 --> 02:50:44.344]  So she went to a briefing with Jen Psaki and talked about the importance of the stabs.
[02:50:44.644 --> 02:50:44.964]  There she is.
[02:50:44.984 --> 02:50:57.095]  And then she sat with Fauci brainstorming about how to peer pressure your friends into it if you're under 18 because vaccines help our bodies learn how to fight viruses and they help everyone.
[02:50:58.098 --> 02:51:03.972]  You know, I don't even think that for like a year into the coup, I'd even ever heard Fauci talk.
[02:51:04.072 --> 02:51:05.696]  So I had no idea what he talked like.
[02:51:05.836 --> 02:51:08.222]  And I heard people doing impersonations of him.
[02:51:08.917 --> 02:51:10.618]  And I thought, huh, well, that's funny.
[02:51:11.058 --> 02:51:14.421]  I'd like to eventually hear what this guy actually sounds like.
[02:51:14.521 --> 02:51:20.705]  And then I finally heard an actual clip of him talking at a, you know, the Rand Paul, you know, when they were questioning him.
[02:51:20.825 --> 02:51:25.348]  I couldn't believe that the impersonations aren't impersonations.
[02:51:25.368 --> 02:51:27.069]  I mean, that's really what it sounds like.
[02:51:27.149 --> 02:51:31.292]  It's like, he sounds like a guy in the corner who is selling things out of his jacket.
[02:51:31.312 --> 02:51:32.593]  Like, I got Madonna.
[02:51:32.633 --> 02:51:37.436]  I got, but he sounds like, no, he more sounds more like a guy who's opening up his jacket with nothing under it.
[02:51:38.176 --> 02:51:39.297]  Like that kind of a guy.
[02:51:39.337 --> 02:51:39.598]  Yeah.
[02:51:40.238 --> 02:51:40.919]  What do you need?
[02:51:41.799 --> 02:51:42.960]  No, like this flasher.
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:43.661]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:51:44.061 --> 02:51:45.162]  He doesn't have any clothes on.
[02:51:45.662 --> 02:51:47.384]  Oh yeah, come take a look at this.
[02:51:47.804 --> 02:51:50.206]  He probably does.
[02:51:51.727 --> 02:51:53.349]  He's flashing his Pfizer all over town.
[02:51:54.955 --> 02:51:55.215]  All right.
[02:51:55.255 --> 02:51:59.237]  So, I mean, this is, yeah, a lot of what you presented today, I didn't know any of that.
[02:51:59.317 --> 02:52:07.681]  I mean, and I like that you brought in the newer pop stars because, you know, this is, it's an old phenomenon, but it continues on and they still do it.
[02:52:07.721 --> 02:52:08.602]  It's really transparent.
[02:52:08.642 --> 02:52:10.203]  It's totally hollow and ridiculous.
[02:52:10.243 --> 02:52:15.826]  I mean, we just saw the White House recruiting TikTokers to talk about geopolitics.
[02:52:15.886 --> 02:52:19.908]  I mean, that's literally the last person on the earth who would know anything about geopolitics.
[02:52:19.968 --> 02:52:20.548]  TikTokers?
[02:52:20.888 --> 02:52:21.589]  Are you serious?
[02:52:21.949 --> 02:52:22.970]  Twerking nurses?
[02:52:23.191 --> 02:52:27.455]  We're going to get our geopolitics from people that twerk on TikTok, right?
[02:52:28.356 --> 02:52:32.200]  And they're saying, please go out there and promote helping Ukraine.
[02:52:32.760 --> 02:52:35.743]  And people don't even know what Ukraine is, right?
[02:52:35.904 --> 02:52:37.105]  This is so insane.
[02:52:37.225 --> 02:52:38.026]  This is so absurd.
[02:52:38.046 --> 02:52:40.408]  This is beyond dystopia.
[02:52:40.508 --> 02:52:59.016]   It's like, You know, when you read 1984, or you read Brave New World, and, you know, they had all this dark stuff, and, you know, especially 1984, and then Huxley gets right, you know, the elements of, it's not that hardcore, it's more of like a drug dystopia, but both of them missed the clown show.
[02:52:59.216 --> 02:53:01.557]  Where is the cartoonish clown show element?
[02:53:02.037 --> 02:53:02.998]  That those guys missed.
[02:53:03.058 --> 02:53:07.900]  I mean, I don't think they could have conceived of the dystopia being this preposterous.
[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:09.281]  It is very circus-like.
[02:53:09.661 --> 02:53:15.324]  And I just saw a podcaster talking about how she voted for Biden because he quoted Hamilton.
[02:53:16.344 --> 02:53:20.046]  But she didn't even know that the quote from Hamilton was quoting the Constitution.
[02:53:20.486 --> 02:53:24.508]  She just thought it was a great quote from the play Hamilton, which she liked and Biden liked.
[02:53:24.528 --> 02:53:25.869]  So that's how Biden won her vote.
[02:53:26.869 --> 02:53:27.129]  Yeah.
[02:53:27.289 --> 02:53:40.499]   Well, you know, there's this line, I'm pretty sure it's not day four, but there's a line where Basically, Winston realizes that in the dystopia, you can contradict yourself from one sentence to the next.
[02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:44.764]  And people don't even realize that that's a contradiction.
[02:53:45.625 --> 02:53:50.810]  They're so initiated into the doublethink, which is like a spell.
[02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:53.173]  It's like you're bound to this spell where you fall for it.
[02:53:54.069 --> 02:53:57.151]  And you continually sort of double down and you can't get out of it.
[02:53:57.191 --> 02:53:57.691]  It's a trap.
[02:53:58.271 --> 02:53:59.592]  And I mean, it's literally a death cult.
[02:53:59.732 --> 02:54:06.715]  So in what all of these pop celebrity people are promoting is the same death cult that the politicians are a part of.
[02:54:06.975 --> 02:54:07.896]  They're all part of a death cult.
[02:54:07.916 --> 02:54:08.596]  It's that simple.
[02:54:08.976 --> 02:54:12.598]  And I was just reminded of one last figure that I had forgotten about.
[02:54:12.698 --> 02:54:13.459]  Jane Fonda.
[02:54:14.419 --> 02:54:15.900]  So she's Hollywood royalty.
[02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:24.349]   And then she went into politics and had a lot of Radical movement right centered around her remember that so
[02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:31.528]   it's just the list goes on and on you can find a lot more Yeah, we'll think again the Laurel Canyon scene right
[02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:48.924]  I mean the whole point of that last InfoWars, well actually it was two shows back when I covered the Dave McGowan Laurel Canyon scene material where he talked about how a lot of the musicians of the counterculture, they were all coming out of prominent Hollywood royalty and military industrial complex and deep state families.
[02:54:49.744 --> 02:54:52.385]  And you mentioned Fonda, I mean Dern, right?
[02:54:52.425 --> 02:54:53.085]  Peter Fonda.
[02:54:54.056 --> 02:54:59.959]  The Derns, I mean, they come out of these prominent families and that's always been the case with Hollywood and the music scene.
[02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:03.862]  And so the counterculture isn't really counterculture, right?
[02:55:03.902 --> 02:55:07.003]  All of these pop stars that we're talking about, they're all bought and paid for.
[02:55:07.364 --> 02:55:10.645]  They're just shills for anything anti-human.
[02:55:11.246 --> 02:55:13.387]  And so that's why they also all promote transhumanism.
[02:55:13.976 --> 02:55:17.060]  So counterculture is just another arm of the establishment.
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:17.701]  Exactly.
[02:55:17.801 --> 02:55:18.602]  And that's the message.
[02:55:18.622 --> 02:55:19.804]  That's the great takeaway here.
[02:55:19.864 --> 02:55:21.786]  So these pop culture figures aren't counterculture.
[02:55:22.127 --> 02:55:24.450]  They're one in a percent, to put it simply.
[02:55:24.510 --> 02:55:26.393]  Illuminating mind control puppets, basically.
[02:55:26.853 --> 02:55:27.234]  All right.
[02:55:27.294 --> 02:55:28.195]  Thank you guys so much.
[02:55:28.455 --> 02:55:29.276]  Be sure and support Alex.
[02:55:29.297 --> 02:55:30.879]  Go to the InfoWars store and get all those products.
[02:55:30.698 --> 02:55:40.137]  This is the tip of the spear.
[02:55:40.154 --> 02:55:46.537]  I got sued more than 50 times by the Democrats after Trump won, and we knocked out and defeated 46 of them.
[02:55:46.637 --> 02:55:53.101]  And we're down to four of the major lawsuits where Democrats sued us in completely rigged jurisdictions and with rigged courts.
[02:55:53.161 --> 02:55:54.561]  Just unbelievable over the top.
[02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:56.963]  In Connecticut, in New Haven, and in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:57.183 --> 02:56:06.308]  Now, I can sit there and keep battling them with the three Austin trials and one Connecticut trial through October.
[02:56:07.466 --> 02:56:08.026]  of this year.
[02:56:08.527 --> 02:56:09.667]  That's four trials.
[02:56:09.868 --> 02:56:16.612]  They're doing four different lawsuits with the Sandy Hook people, two different law firms, all coordinated, to bankrupt us.
[02:56:17.692 --> 02:56:23.956]  And they know now, because the court's ordering all this stuff that's unconstitutional, our finances, they know there's not extra money there.
[02:56:24.236 --> 02:56:25.657]  And they've told us, we don't care.
[02:56:25.977 --> 02:56:28.439]  We want you to be shut down.
[02:56:28.939 --> 02:56:30.560]  Or you can come out against the Second Amendment.
[02:56:30.580 --> 02:56:31.321]  They've actually told us that.
[02:56:32.061 --> 02:56:32.962]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:56:33.742 --> 02:56:34.423]  It's very simple.
[02:56:35.538 --> 02:56:50.563]  So, I can go through the kangaroo trials with them, and do all that, and then appeal it, and hold them off another year or two, because their goal is to just come padlock and shut this place down, or we can just boycott their trials, and then they get their $500 million judgments.
[02:56:50.743 --> 02:56:51.523]  That's what they asked for.
[02:56:51.743 --> 02:56:56.444]  They asked the insurance company that Genesis has.
[02:56:56.584 --> 02:56:58.525]  I don't have liability insurance for speech.
[02:56:59.005 --> 02:57:00.586]  They said, we want $590 million.
[02:57:00.646 --> 02:57:01.506]  Excuse me, it's $590 million.
[02:57:01.526 --> 02:57:02.446]  Ted doesn't have $2 million.
[02:57:05.367 --> 02:57:16.414]  Okay, that's how out of control these people are because when you're in a rigged game and know it's all rigged and known that, you know, it's all set up from the beginning with judicial tyranny, you can do stuff like that.
[02:57:16.594 --> 02:57:17.754]  They're not going to shut me up.
[02:57:17.894 --> 02:57:18.955]  I'm not going to be shut down.
[02:57:19.315 --> 02:57:24.959]  They can try to, you know, hurt this operation in this facility, but oh, let me tell you, they're not, they're not going to silence anything.
[02:57:25.659 --> 02:57:33.759]   The point is, is that this crew and this infrastructure and all the reporters And all the things that we do here that's so important needs to continue on.
[02:57:33.779 --> 02:57:35.280]  So I've decided to go ahead and battle it.
[02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:37.021]  I've decided to go ahead and fight them.
[02:57:37.481 --> 02:57:39.942]  I've decided to let them have their show trials and all the rest of it.
[02:57:39.982 --> 02:57:48.765]  And, you know, a judge that says we can't put on evidence because we're already guilty in a default, but we're going to have a jury trial about how guilty I am.
[02:57:49.265 --> 02:57:50.145]  So you're guilty.
[02:57:50.205 --> 02:57:51.266]  They just decide how guilty.
[02:57:52.046 --> 02:57:52.786]  Unbelievable.
[02:57:53.046 --> 02:57:53.707]  That's all fine.
[02:57:53.727 --> 02:57:54.447]  We'll let them do it.
[02:57:54.827 --> 02:57:56.928]  Every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[02:57:57.228 --> 02:57:59.548]  Whatever the devil means for evil, God turns to good.
[02:57:59.888 --> 02:58:05.370]  I've seen this so many times, but we need the funds to go through these four trials.
[02:58:05.850 --> 02:58:08.891]  They want six to eight weeks in Connecticut for their extravaganza.
[02:58:09.391 --> 02:58:18.641]   In Austin, they have BBC and HBO and the lawyers primping and the judge primping and coming in all excited.
[02:58:18.782 --> 02:58:19.682]  It's disgusting.
[02:58:19.902 --> 02:58:21.344]  They claim I live off Sandy Hook.
[02:58:21.564 --> 02:58:23.165]  They claim I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:58:23.506 --> 02:58:25.307]  You know, this Elizabeth Williams writes a book about it.
[02:58:25.327 --> 02:58:26.048]  It's all over the news.
[02:58:26.388 --> 02:58:28.550]  Selling her book saying I made money off Sandy Hook.
[02:58:28.830 --> 02:58:29.771]  Never made money off that.
[02:58:29.811 --> 02:58:30.752]  Barely ever talked about it.
[02:58:31.032 --> 02:58:34.195]  These are a disgusting lot of leeches.
[02:58:34.676 --> 02:58:36.237]  Okay, these media people, these lawyers.
[02:58:36.417 --> 02:58:37.077]  But that's fine.
[02:58:37.317 --> 02:58:38.738]  Everybody sees them for what they are.
[02:58:39.098 --> 02:58:40.259]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[02:58:40.559 --> 02:58:43.060]  It's all turning to crap in their hands.
[02:58:43.601 --> 02:58:45.422]  But I need funds to fight this war.
[02:58:45.922 --> 02:58:46.822]  This information war.
[02:58:46.882 --> 02:58:48.963]  So, it's very simple.
[02:58:49.284 --> 02:58:51.044]  All of our work's coming to a head right now.
[02:58:51.165 --> 02:58:55.006]  Every day we're having major breakthroughs and just doing incredible things.
[02:58:55.046 --> 02:58:55.707]  Thanks for your support.
[02:58:56.496 --> 02:58:58.076]  But I need more capital now than ever.
[02:58:58.096 --> 02:59:00.617]  We had to build our own infrastructure, our own bandwidth, our own everything.
[02:59:01.077 --> 02:59:02.538]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:02.718 --> 02:59:09.540]  Go there and that will, by buying the products, pay for the 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a day we get at Man.Video.
[02:59:09.620 --> 02:59:14.481]  And that'll pay for the broadcast here and the infrastructure and all of this that's hurting the New World Order.
[02:59:14.661 --> 02:59:15.861]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:59:15.882 --> 02:59:17.702]  We have up to 75% off right now.
[02:59:18.082 --> 02:59:21.103]  Massive clearance sale to fund this legal defense of this battle.
[02:59:21.283 --> 02:59:22.363]  And we're never going to give up.
[02:59:22.583 --> 02:59:23.484]  We're never going to get it in.
[02:59:23.524 --> 02:59:24.464]  But we could give out.
[02:59:24.884 --> 02:59:28.466]  So we need your financial support now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:28.566 --> 02:59:48.566]  Don't wait and I salute you and thank you all.
[02:59:48.579 --> 02:59:49.879]  I've been taking it for 20 years.
[02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:53.922]  I learned with children, especially, when they were, you know, tired and grumpy but not going to sleep.
[02:59:54.042 --> 02:59:58.967]  Give them a little bit of that, you know, mood stuff, or whatever you want to call it, and they would sleep a lot better.
[02:59:59.027 --> 03:00:01.089]  And it's good for their heart, your whole electrochemical system.
[03:00:01.209 --> 03:00:06.054]  So, our developers came up with one that has both types of the good magnesium and tastes even better.
[03:00:06.155 --> 03:00:07.176]  And I'm just blown away by it.
[03:00:07.196 --> 03:00:08.397]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[03:00:08.457 --> 03:00:09.678]  I'm so glad it's back in.
[03:00:09.758 --> 03:00:11.720]  Fizzy Magnesium, 25% off.
[03:00:12.221 --> 03:00:13.142]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:00:13.182 --> 03:00:14.303]  You need to experience it.
[03:00:14.763 --> 03:00:15.724]  And then a new item.
[03:00:16.445 --> 03:00:18.226]  I've been wanting it for two years, finally got it.
[03:00:18.306 --> 03:00:20.427]  It's Immune Support from InfoWars Life.
[03:00:20.587 --> 03:00:24.910]  Elderberry, Echinacea, Astrologous Root, Angelica Root, and Lomatum Root.
[03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:28.792]  All of these are concentrated, cold-pressed, from one of the top developers in the country.
[03:00:29.012 --> 03:00:30.753]  So good for adults, children, everybody.
[03:00:30.833 --> 03:00:35.255]  This is something you should be taking every day, 12 months out of the year, and it funds the InfoWars.
[03:00:35.335 --> 03:00:36.616]  Immune Support, now available.
[03:00:36.716 --> 03:00:37.717]  InfoWarsStore.com.
