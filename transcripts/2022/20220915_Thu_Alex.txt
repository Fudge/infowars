[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  The globalists are in grave danger.
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  Their new world order is not going well.
[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  Humanity is waking up to them all over the planet.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  There are populist parties, nationalist parties, anti-world economic forum.
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  Parties coming to power.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.000]  The new Conservative leader in Canada is completely anti-new world order
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  and just won the leadership of his party.
[00:27.000 --> 00:32.000]  If they held elections today, Justin Trudeau would be removed as the leader of Canada.
[00:32.000 --> 00:38.000]  Go Trudeau, you're nothing but a communist pig.
[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  But why is it so important that we're on the air?
[00:42.000 --> 00:47.000]  Why is it so important you're backing of the few LACs of truth and freedom?
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  Because as things get worse and worse, as the new world order comes out in the open,
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  people are hungering for the truth more than ever, and the globalists know if we stay on air
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war, we will win, they will go to prison.
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  They will be defeated.
[01:04.000 --> 01:06.000]  You will stay.
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  Come out and keep out.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  President, humanity, your vote, too, is happening.
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  Open fair and start time, we have all the research.
[01:15.000 --> 01:21.000]  That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential that you continue in the face of censorship
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  and everything that's going on by word of mouth, by text message, by email, by the side of your barn,
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  the back of your car, calling you to talk radio, calling you to c-span.
[01:29.000 --> 01:37.000]  Frankly, what I'm focused on today is building the united front against what, and this is not hyper-belief,
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  what to me is U.S. fascism.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Let's chat with a few callers.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  John's up first out of Austin, Texas, independent. Good morning.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Good morning.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'm listening to Mr. Mitchell here and just as an American.
[01:51.000 --> 01:57.000]  And I'm wondering how it is that Trump is a cult and the Democratic Party is an cult
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  when they've already instituted socialism, they've flirted with communism,
[02:02.000 --> 02:10.000]  and you talk about fascism, we can talk a lot about the Democratic Party and their neo-fascist views.
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  So why is it that you want to bring the country together yet you want to take this extreme side?
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  The Republican Party has been captured by a political cult.
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.000]  I don't use those words lightly.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.000]  Aligning to cult things, you can go back to Obama administration,
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  but I would also go more recent history.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  You've got the Black Lives Matter, the Antifa siding with Democrats, the cities were burned down, people were murdered.
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.000]  It seems very cult-like we've got the Biden administration with pharmaceutical companies
[02:41.000 --> 02:47.000]  spending billions of dollars on vaccines that went from 100% efficacy to 40% efficacy,
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  and they're making billions of dollars. We've had free speech taken away.
[02:52.000 --> 02:56.000]  Plymouth, Michigan, this is Janice, Line for Republicans. Good morning.
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  Good morning. Mr. Mitchell, there are none so blind as those who cannot see.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  Let me give you a little piece of advice.
[03:06.000 --> 03:18.000]  You will never succeed in your goal by insulting half the country and calling them fascists, racists, ultra-magas.
[03:18.000 --> 03:25.000]  So that's political violence that you're talking about that Republicans and ultra-magas are doing.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  It doesn't exist. It's a lie. It is a lie.
[03:29.000 --> 03:34.000]  There was political violence in our country in the summer of 2020.
[03:34.000 --> 03:42.000]  Wherever you can be heard, know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million, you're going to win the fight.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.000]  Meanwhile, Democrat Senator compares 9-11 terrorists to January 6 rioters.
[03:48.000 --> 03:55.000]  The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists,
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  but it came from literally insurgents attacking the Capitol on January 6.
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  Some of those answers will come from Republicans. It's not the extremists that we're dealing with every single day.
[04:05.000 --> 04:07.000]  We've got to kill and confront that movement.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  What is a semi-fascist?
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  Most people in America know that it is not helpful to our country when we have people who are denying elections
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.000]  or trying to obstruct the outcome of an election.
[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000]  We are seeing an emerging threat, of course, over the last several years of the domestic violent extremist.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  The individual here in the United States radicalized the violence by a foreign terrorist ideology,
[04:31.000 --> 04:42.000]  but also an ideology of hate, anti-government sentiment, false narratives propagated on online platforms, even personal grievances.
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  But then they're going to start, though, with Alex Jones.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  We're just going to censor Alex Jones, and then Donald Trump, and then well everybody, and well now it's a social credit score
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  through the banks that tracks what you buy and what you do.
[04:52.000 --> 05:16.000]  This is all being rolled out worldwide. It's here now.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  Now over a year and a half ago, we came out with a product that was top sourced, top of the line, as good as it's going to get.
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  But then the supply chain broke down and it was sold out for more than a year.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time at InfoWarsTour.com 30% off.
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  This limited time left time to go into all the great things it does or what it has inside.

[05:46.000 --> 05:51.000]  And what's just as amazing is it funds the InfoWars and keeps us on air.

[06:10.000 --> 06:18.000]  We are on the march. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[06:18.000 --> 06:25.000]  The globalist Great Reset Empire is on the run. The Great Reset and the War of the World is now number one on Amazon,
[06:25.000 --> 06:35.000]  number one book in the world topping all charts, thanks to the people's hunger for the truth.
[06:35.000 --> 06:40.000]  The New York Times. It's really a philosophical question. It's hard to answer directly. Let's see.
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  How drunk was the guy you saw passed out in the men's room at a Packers' Game?
[06:44.000 --> 06:50.000]  How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband? Well the answer in all cases is very, extremely,
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  so thoroughly and so totally that it's hard to put into words.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  So instead of describing the dishonesty of the New York Times with conventional adjectives,
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  we'll give you a specific example because we think it tells you more.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  So last week, the paper told us that the best-selling book in the United States was a title called
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  I'm Glad My Mom Died by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  But that was not true. That book was not the best-selling book in America.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  In fact, the best-selling book in America last week was The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  written by Alex Jones.
[07:21.000 --> 07:32.000]  Jones sold more than 56,000 copies of his book last week. Jeanette McCurdy, whatever her merits, we have no idea,
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  sold 34,686 copies of her book. So Alex Jones sold a lot more books.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country, but the New York Times lied about that
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War by lying about weapons mass destruction and got a million people killed.
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  But Alex Jones is worse. He's a mental patient. No one listens to him.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  So they lied about his book. What else are they lying about? You wonder.
[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  I am very honored and very blessed and very thankful to viewers and listeners and Steve Bannon and others
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  that pushed The Great Reset and the War for the World, this book, to number one in the U.S. and in the top ten in the world.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  And of course, the New York Times suppressed that.
[08:13.000 --> 08:18.000]  It's now backfired and the book is absolutely exploding.
[08:18.000 --> 08:22.000]  Get your signed copy of the number one book in America.
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  Available exclusively right now at infostore.com.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  It's Thursday, September 15, 2022. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  We have a huge guest who worked at Health and Human Services
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  and was an advisor to President Trump who warned him about Operation Warp Speed
[08:51.000 --> 08:59.000]  and who witnessed Berks and Fauci and others bragging how they were setting Trump up for a fall.
[08:59.000 --> 09:07.000]  This is going to be a huge in-studio interview in two hours or an hour and 50 minutes or so
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  And then Jason Burmes is always loaded for bear, hosting the 4th hour ahead of Owen Shroyer
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  at 3 to 6 p.m. with the Info Wars War Room.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  Often imitated but never duplicated.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  So that is coming up. All right.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  Here's what we've got, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  We've got so much we're going to be hitting today.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  We have Fauci again testifying before he leaves his office after 44 years,
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  running the HIV attack, running so many other criminal operations.
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  Fauci completely lied to Congress again.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.000]  It's incredible.
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  And we're going to lay out how he lied to Congress.
[09:58.000 --> 10:08.000]  Not just on gain of function, but now saying that, well, he's not profiting from the shots,
[10:08.000 --> 10:09.000]  which isn't true.
[10:09.000 --> 10:16.000]  And plus, he wasn't involved in the decision of what injections to get emergency approval.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  Though he was in charge of the whole thing and had three different FDA boards removed
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.000]  until they finally got a board of picked criminals and or dupes.
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  Better for the doubt, and it's still proven guilty, but we know they did it.
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.000]  We know they committed the crime against humanity.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  They had to replace three boards until they finally got a board that would vote unanimously
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  to roll out these poison shots and their poison boosters.
[10:44.000 --> 10:46.000]  It's just insane.
[10:46.000 --> 10:51.000]  And more British Medical Journal reports and more New England Medical Journal reports,
[10:51.000 --> 10:58.000]  prestigious groups out there confirming 93 times to 102 times more likely to die or get sick
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  or be hospitalized if you've had the shots.
[11:00.000 --> 11:10.000]  I mean, they really hit us with a chemical, biological, mutagenic weapon.
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  They really did it.
[11:11.000 --> 11:16.000]  I mean, even I just cannot believe the boldness of this, but they think you're stupid.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  They think I'm stupid.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  They think you can get away with it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  So we've got a big stack.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  I'm going to hit next segment on that.
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  But let me tell you what else is coming up today.
[11:24.000 --> 11:30.000]  Not just Dr. Alexander, but something where the people are striking back with common sense.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  The governor of Texas finally doing something good.
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  The governor of DeSantis of Florida, continuing to do great stuff,
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  are delivering illegal aliens to Kamala Harris's house.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And also that's Texas doing that.
[11:42.000 --> 11:47.000]  And to Martha's Vineyard, one of the most elite areas in the country where Barack Obama
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.000]  and all these other globalists have giant mansions at one foot above sea level.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  Like they're building bigger mansions, but they say we'll all be flooded.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  We'd all be under water by 2016, 2018, but they build giant mansions in Hawaii
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  and in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
[12:04.000 --> 12:07.000]  We have all that coming up.
[12:07.000 --> 12:12.000]  We have the show trial entering its third day in Connecticut.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  I'll be up there next week.
[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  The judge is saying, oh, I'm going to sanction him once he gets here, once he's under my control.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.000]  And explaining that I don't let him put on a defense because he didn't give us any documents.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  He cavalierly refused.
[12:26.000 --> 12:30.000]  Then they present the documents, everything we gave them, because we were innocent,
[12:30.000 --> 12:31.000]  because they didn't have a case.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  She now has to carry out this fraud.
[12:34.000 --> 12:42.000]  But across the legal community, people are just saying, my God, this is something worthy of Venezuela.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  This is unbelievable.
[12:44.000 --> 12:47.000]  We also have huge news dealing with Russia.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  And I mean, this news is so dangerous and so out of control.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  I don't even know where to begin.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  They tried to kill Putin.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  It turns out a month ago, Ukraine's bragging.
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Russia confirms that Putin did survive an assassination attempt.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  They've killed a bunch of Russian generals, Alexander Dugan's daughter, a bunch of other journalists,
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  and they've killed a bunch of other Russian leaders.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  So the globalists are in Russia assassinating people and carboning them, shooting them, strangling them, poisoning them.
[13:15.000 --> 13:23.000]  I mean, we are at war with Russia on their border with high-tech weapons.
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  And yes, the Russians have put up a big fight, but yeah, they're losing.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  And so what do Russians do when they lose?
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  When they start losing, well, Russians get very coalesced in hard line and they go crazy.
[13:40.000 --> 13:47.000]  And so this is a serious situation because it's not like Vietnam where we go and invade a country
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  and you have questionable issues that are there.
[13:50.000 --> 13:57.000]  You can't like say, oh, Russia just invaded Ukraine because it's a Southeast Asia of 15,000 miles from America.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  Russia was born in Ukraine.
[13:59.000 --> 14:01.000]  More than half the population is Russian.
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  So I'm not happy the Russians invaded.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  They got tricked to invade.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  I think it's a bad idea.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  I said that in February.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  I said, this is going to turn out bad.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  It's a trap.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  Putin's walked into a trap.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  Not even Russian media admits that.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  So this is a bad situation.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  But again, who's even crazier?
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  The globalists that overthrew the Ukrainian government that was elected eight years ago.
[14:18.000 --> 14:26.000]  George Soros on TV bragging they overthrew Russia, overthrew Ukraine, which is where you get the name Russia from.
[14:26.000 --> 14:32.000]  Like take Belarus to the north of Ukraine and bordering Western Russia.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  What does Baila mean?
[14:34.000 --> 14:35.000]  Belarus.
[14:35.000 --> 14:36.000]  White.
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  And that's because they, you know, Russians had red hair.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  They were founded by the Rus.
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  But then they would call the people up north, the white Russians, they had blonde hair, platinum hair.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  But it all started with this.
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  We quote the name.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  I'll quote it wrong.
[14:52.000 --> 14:57.000]  We slob the great about a thousand years ago created.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  What is the Russian culture in Ukraine?
[14:59.000 --> 15:13.000]  And then about a hundred years later, the Muslims invaded and Ukraine, which is the birthplace of the Russians got overwhelmed and defeated and occupied for over a hundred years.
[15:13.000 --> 15:21.000]  And then Moscow, which was this big tribe of Rus or Vikings who founded the area, they came in and annihilated.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  The Muslims and they also had a big contingent of Huns aiding them.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  And that's where you get Russia and then the unified system you have.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  So this is insane.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  And if you know the history, it's just completely crazy that we're involved in a Russian civil war.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  That's what the Ukrainian Russian thing is.
[15:41.000 --> 15:47.000]  The civil war sparked by George Soros trying to spark a revolution and a civil war here.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  And the global start the fire and sit back and roast hot dogs over it.
[15:51.000 --> 15:52.000]  So we're going to hit all that.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  It's just so much today.
[15:53.000 --> 16:15.000]  But this Senator Paul confronting Fauci is the rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients that are known to make us healthy, to make us vibrant and to defend our immune systems.

[18:59.000 --> 19:04.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[19:08.000 --> 19:17.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[19:17.000 --> 19:25.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[19:25.000 --> 19:33.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[19:33.000 --> 19:44.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[19:44.000 --> 19:53.000]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[19:53.000 --> 20:00.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[20:00.000 --> 20:07.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:30.000 --> 20:42.000]  My friend, I'll say it clear, I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
[20:42.000 --> 20:59.000]  I've lived a life that's full, I traveled each and every highway and more, much more than this.
[20:59.000 --> 21:10.000]  And Fauci, little mass murdering eugenics criminal, part of the eugenics depopulation cult with Bill Gates,
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  he's now being nailed down and caught lying to Congress yesterday. Here is the video.
[21:18.000 --> 21:29.000]  Any of the guidelines for vaccines from the government include previous infection as something to base your decision making on with vaccines.
[21:29.000 --> 21:36.000]  Do any of the guidelines involve previous infection? That's why you're ignoring previous infection because it doesn't involve any of the guidelines.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  And furthermore, we've been asking you and you refuse to answer whether anybody on the vaccine committees gets royalties from the pharmaceutical companies.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  I asked you last time, and what was your response? We don't have to tell you.
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  We've demanded them through Freedom of Information Act, and what have you said? We're not going to tell you.
[21:54.000 --> 22:02.000]  But I tell you this, when we get in charge, we're going to change the rules and you will have to divulge where you get your royalties from, from what companies.
[22:02.000 --> 22:07.000]  And if anybody on the committee has a conflict of interest, we're going to learn about it. I promise you that.
[22:07.000 --> 22:18.000]  Mr. Chair, can I respond to that, please? Okay, there are two aspects for what you said. You keep saying you approve, you do this, you do that.
[22:18.000 --> 22:30.000]  The committees that give the approval are FDA through their advisory committee. The committees that recommend are CDC through their advisory committee.
[22:30.000 --> 22:40.000]  And you keep saying, I'm the one that's approving a vaccine based on certain data, so I don't really understand, with all due respect, Senator.
[22:40.000 --> 22:49.000]  You're the one that said you would not reveal, you would not reveal what companies gave you royalties or what company gave the other scientists royalties.
[22:49.000 --> 23:06.000]  That's what you told the committee. Senator Paul, can I please answer that? Briefly, yes. You keep asking committees, they're not my committees, they're the VRPAC committee for the FDA and the ACIP for the CDC.
[23:06.000 --> 23:14.000]  So I don't have any idea what goes on with them. They won't reveal as well as you won't reveal.
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  Now what you saw is bigger than the poison shot, bigger than Fauci, bigger than Bill Gates, it's everything.
[23:20.000 --> 23:29.000]  I could teach a four year college course on that one and a half minute clip.
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  And why could I? Well, it would take years to explain it all.
[23:32.000 --> 23:54.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, he advised both the presidents, it's on record with the emails pre-cub and release in early 2020, that they were creating these exact viruses, even the British Medical Journal came out yesterday.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  We have the article right here, I'll show it to you in a moment, and said, okay, we think it came out of the lab.
[23:58.000 --> 24:03.000]  Well, it's known, they scanned the virus, it's artificial, it's a chimeric, it's a mix.
[24:03.000 --> 24:16.000]  And they're specifically in there with Fauci running a program with Peter Dazik and NIH funding that under Obama, when he was setting up the NIH, got a bunch of exposure so that he'd move the illegal program from North Carolina Chapel Hill there.
[24:16.000 --> 24:25.000]  This is all came out seven years ago. People ask, how'd you know all this? How'd Dr. Boyle know it all two and a half years ago because it already happened?
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  It was already a major scandal, we covered seven years ago.
[24:29.000 --> 24:38.000]  So most people tune into news, tune out, they just kind of listen to the surface, and here's Fauci saying, I have nothing to do with this, you made the damn virus.
[24:38.000 --> 24:51.000]  And then he advises the presidents, and he's the main advisor to the NIH and to the CDC, and three boards, the first board wouldn't approve the experimental shot.
[24:51.000 --> 25:01.000]  Fired. The second board wouldn't approve under 16. Fired.
[25:01.000 --> 25:09.000]  The third board wouldn't approve the so-called booster shot, saying it would erase immunity and cause all sorts of serious problems. Fired.
[25:09.000 --> 25:20.000]  They have a fourth board that would approve whatever they were told. That monstrous little lying garden gnome ran the whole thing on record and he sits up there and goes,
[25:20.000 --> 25:29.000]  I don't even know what gain of function is. I'm not involved. He ran conferences called gain of function.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  But he thinks you're stupid. You're not stupid. You're busy raising your family and working hard and paying all the taxes. I get it.
[25:35.000 --> 25:46.000]  But listen, you need to understand who this little monster, this piece of garbage is right here because Hitler did his killing out in the open.
[25:46.000 --> 25:53.000]  These guys are smart, and here's the rest of the story. I could talk again for ten years on this, literally.
[25:53.000 --> 26:03.000]  That's how the New World Order operates, is plausible in liability. They put all their people in the different boards and the different agencies,
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  and then they all point the fingers at each other and say, nobody approved it.
[26:08.000 --> 26:17.000]  And so when it comes out, they killed a bunch of people and a diseased a bunch of people and maimed a bunch of people, millions of people, and caused all these cancers and the rest of it,
[26:17.000 --> 26:32.000]  they just go, oh, well, it was approved by this, it was approved by that. But the truth is, three boards, one, two, three, in the first year and a half, were removed
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  until they got that fourth board. Remember, we played the clip probably fifty times, where the board head goes, well, we don't know what it's going to do,
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  so we're just going to give it to the kids and see. And he starts laughing in the meeting. It's so funny.
[26:48.000 --> 26:58.000]  This is what makes me just see red. And he sits up there before Congress and lies to the world, and he thinks it's cute.
[26:58.000 --> 27:08.000]  He thinks it's funny, because he thinks he is immune, because they spread at globalist UN boards and WEF boards.
[27:08.000 --> 27:14.000]  And oh, Clashwa Braz, we've taken over half the governments of the world and we've penetrated the cabinets, and then it's all his policies.
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  But oh, when it all comes out, oh, I don't run anything, I'm just a think tank. Same thing here.
[27:20.000 --> 27:32.000]  Well, I didn't do it. The NIH and the CDC separately all approved an unapproved injection that their own scientists warned them,
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  and the first board, the second board, and the third board, because each board got worse. They finally found a board that would do the experimental shot.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  Then they found a board that would give it to people under sixteen. Then they found a board that would push the damn boosters, and it was all on record.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.000]  And it's all come out, so let me show you some of the headlines and back up what I was saying.
[27:50.000 --> 27:55.000]  Rand Paul to Fauci, I promise you the public will learn where you get your royalties from. It's on record, he owns part of the patents.
[27:55.000 --> 28:04.000]  New Lancet report says COVID could have originated in the lab. Denmark man's COVID vaccines in under fifty.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  Israel documents come out, and there's a new Canadian document that's now public where they said Ivermectin totally works as a treatment two years ago, and they suppressed it.
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  That's called mass murder. Ivermectin emails inside public health agency of Canada.
[28:18.000 --> 28:25.000]  And it goes on. So if you're wondering what's happening, they've carried out their attack, they're testing to see if they can do another one,
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.000]  and now they're acting like they weren't part of it and they're all blaming somebody else. Here is Jake Tapper of All People When We Come Back on CNN.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  Think children shouldn't wear masks. Masks don't protect you and it mentally hurts children, but you support it the whole time.
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.000]  Now that the tide turned against you, now you act like the good guy on our side, so you can beat us and attack us again.
[28:46.000 --> 28:54.000]  It's how men that beat women treat the women. It's the same abuser paradigm, and I'm not going to sit here and take these bullies anymore.
[28:54.000 --> 29:10.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  Brain Force Plus is a long-term acting, clean, and utropic.
[29:37.000 --> 29:46.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting, utropic that creates incredible clarity, but doesn't last very long.
[29:46.000 --> 29:55.000]  They're all three different formulas, and finally, back at stock, massively discounted, Brain Force Ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[29:55.000 --> 30:17.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year, and I believe the most powerful, the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[30:17.000 --> 30:26.000]  It exists in the world. It will never be made again. It's not just an amazing historic coin. It funds the information war against the globalist.
[30:26.000 --> 30:36.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren. This is something you want to own, and as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalist.

[31:00.000 --> 31:09.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system, for your brain, for every part of your body.
[31:09.000 --> 31:18.000]  But what I don't see being promoted is the fact that it has natural, psychotropic effects. It certainly does for me.
[31:18.000 --> 31:24.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules from an hour before bed, my sleep, my dreams are amazing.
[31:24.000 --> 31:33.000]  Now, there are actually some studies out there linking it to amazing events in the brain, but I want you to experience it yourself.

[33:00.000 --> 33:23.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.000 --> 33:31.000]  Alright, two days ago he was on a hunting trip early in the morning, stopped in to get breakfast at a Hardee's and a bunch of FBI vehicles surrounding him.
[33:31.000 --> 33:39.000]  He's told that story, he'll recap, but he's got breaking news now on what's happening. He's being investigated for investigating election fraud.
[33:39.000 --> 33:43.000]  I saw all these news of them finding stolen voting machines. The FBI wouldn't even come look at it.
[33:43.000 --> 33:53.000]  I guess if he was human smuggling across the border or shipping in fentanyl or doing a drag queen story time, it'd be okay, but because Mike Lindell is trying to have integrity and investigate election fraud,
[33:53.000 --> 34:03.000]  he is per sudden ungrotted because after all, Biden says the main terror threat is people questioning elections or lockdowns or forced inoculations or open borders.
[34:03.000 --> 34:11.000]  So what a time to be alive. Mike Lindell, obviously icon from mypilla.com and all the great work he's done promoting American freedom and liberty.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[34:13.000 --> 34:21.000]  Thanks for having me on Alex. Yeah, it's been quite a couple of days, but I'll tell you everybody, there's a good silver lining here.
[34:21.000 --> 34:31.000]  Actually, Tucker talked about the machines the last two nights on Fox on Newsmax actually had me on and Salem Media talked.
[34:31.000 --> 34:41.000]  So our conservative media that I've been badmouthing for over a year now or over a year and a half that won't have our voice when it comes to these machines getting rid of or the selection crime,
[34:41.000 --> 34:53.000]  the biggest crime in history is finally getting talked about. And I did over 56 interviews the last two days. So the word is getting out where they were trying to suppress the word.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  And now that is the silver lining.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  So there's a big, a big backfire that's happened.
[34:59.000 --> 35:09.000]  Absolutely. And I'll tell you, I'll just tell you if you want, I'll break the news right now to your audience.
[35:09.000 --> 35:15.000]  This morning, after all this happened, we can replay what happened or re-talk about what happened.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  I was on my phone with some of the best lawyers I have, which is Alan Dershowitz, Kurt Olson, Andrew Parker.
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  I was on my phone for two and a half hours this morning. I said, I want to be, I want to be on the offense.
[35:29.000 --> 35:37.000]  What can we do here? This is, this is insanity that they take my company phone that runs all these businesses and all my passwords.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  I can't do money wires, anything because the passwords are on that phone.
[35:41.000 --> 35:49.000]  And here it is, everybody, we're suing the United States government. I'm suing them and the FBI.
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.000]  They broke my first, fourth, and fifth amendment rights, constitutional rights.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  We're not going to stand for in this country. They don't get to act like the Gestapo in Nazi Germany.
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.000]  You know, Alex, when I told them, I mean, why don't you just come and bash my door down like you did all the people in Colorado,
[36:06.000 --> 36:13.000]  like Sharona Bishop, one of the FBI's from Colorado said, well, Sharona didn't open her door fast enough.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  I said, oh, 42 seconds wasn't fast enough for you, huh?
[36:16.000 --> 36:22.000]  So if you get your door bashed in, if the FBI knocks on your door, make sure that you do it under,
[36:22.000 --> 36:31.000]  they answer the door under 41 seconds or you're going to be paying for a whole new door on top of the FBI invading your privacy and attacking your family.
[36:31.000 --> 36:36.000]  Well, the FBI already has been discredited and it's not just the higher ups now.
[36:36.000 --> 36:41.000]  It's throughout the structure. They've got special political units like the commasars in Russia that come after people.
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.000]  They have just destroyed any credibility they've got. They are nothing but a deep state tool now.
[36:46.000 --> 36:49.000]  Yep. Absolutely.
[36:49.000 --> 36:56.000]  Tell us more about the details of the raid and now they're saying computer crimes, computer theft.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  Yeah, here's what happened, everybody.
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  So I am heading down, got up at four in the morning, my buddy and I headed down to Iowa where I live in Minnesota.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  It's about a two and a half hour drive.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  It was the early duck season, teal, and we get nine teal. Our limit, it would be 12 between the two of us.
[37:12.000 --> 37:19.000]  And I said, hey, I got to get back. I have this new platform, mystore.com, for all these USA products and these entrepreneurs.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  I was doing filming with a bunch of them that day and I said, let's get going.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  And so we left early. We get into Mankato, Minnesota and I said, let's quick go through a drive-thru.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  And there was a Hardee's there, a Hardee's restaurant.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  We pulled in through the drive-thru, got our food and she said some of it wasn't ready.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  She said, can you pull ahead a little bit? I'll bring the rest of your food out.
[37:40.000 --> 37:48.000]  So I pulled ahead a little bit with my pickup and here this car pulls perpendicular right in front of us.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  And I said to my buddy, the guy's not looking at us. I said, this is weird. Something's going down.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  I actually said that. I mean, I've been around the block.
[37:56.000 --> 38:02.000]  And this guy, another vehicle pulls up to his passenger side and locks us in there.
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.000]  And then I look in the rear view mirror and one comes flying up the drive-thru and blocks us in from the back.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  It's like a scene right out of a movie.
[38:09.000 --> 38:14.000]  And I go, I told my friend, like I said, hold on, these are bad people.
[38:14.000 --> 38:19.000]  I open up the door and I yell loud enough for people to hear me in the park a lot and maybe inside the restaurant.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  I said, what do you guys want and who are you? What do you want?
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  And these are just regular beat-up cars and they're not dressed.
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  None of them have the FBI on or the FBI thing on.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  And I said, he goes, we're with the FBI.
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  And I said, I don't believe you. Show me your badges.
[38:37.000 --> 38:41.000]  And the one guy says, he showed me a badge, but I'm looking at it from afar.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  And I said, how about your badge?
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  And he showed me his. I said, you back there.
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  I said, I still don't believe you.
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  But I said, what do you want?
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  He goes, well, he said, we want to talk to you.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  So we moved the cars apart or he moved the cars and he pulled.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  I pulled up over here and they got me boxed in.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  All these, all these agents get out.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  I guess it turns out they were from Colorado and Minnesota and they come up to,
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  they kind of circle me in there and I get out and they,
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  and they says, I said, well, what questions you got?
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  I said, am I being arrested?
[39:12.000 --> 39:13.000]  They said, no.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  I said, well, then what do you want?
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  And I said, you've been tracking me.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  I said, what do you, I said, what do you,
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  then I, and then I got kind of mad.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  He's go, what did you watch me go duck cutting this morning?
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  I said, what, what is with you guys?
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  They said, we want to ask you questions.
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  And, and that's when I said, before we've got interested,
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  well, why don't you just bash my door in like you do all the other people?
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.000]  And that's when they said the Sharon of Bishop thing that it,
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  we went to bash hers in, but she took too long to answer.
[39:40.000 --> 39:43.000]  And then I said, we started asking questions.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  And the first question they asked Alex was they go,
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  you have evidence up on your platform, frankspeech.com.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  You have evidence of what's inside a Dominion machine.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Where did you get that evidence?
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  I said, hello.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  I said, what do you think I've been doing for the last year and a half?
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  I said that, that particular piece.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  So came right off the internet.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  You could all watch it yourself.
[40:08.000 --> 40:11.000]  And I said, and then he goes, then he asked me, he says,
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  you fly your plane all over and you land in all these different states.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  And I said, he goes, what, what do you do all that for?
[40:18.000 --> 40:19.000]  What are you doing?
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  I said, well, first of all, that's none of your business.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  I said, you're tracking my plane to, he goes, well, yeah,
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  your tail number, anybody can do that.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  And I go, well, let me tell you something.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  As long as you ask, I've been flying around this country,
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  visiting Attorney General, Secretary of State,
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  Crooked Secretary of States, actually.
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  I only found one that's decent.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  And I said, and legislatures and people, and I said,
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  to get rid of these electronic computers and voting machine.
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  And then he went into another question.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  He goes, when did you first meet Tina Peters?
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  And I go, at the cyber symposium, you guys already know that?
[40:55.000 --> 40:59.000]  I said, I flew in from all over our country, cyber experts,
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  and people from around the country, politicians and stuff.
[41:04.000 --> 41:07.000]  And then I said, I said, oh, you must be talking about
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  the Dennis Montgomery terabytes that I own now,
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  which is sitting by the way, everybody, in Nevada,
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  that the government has a gag order on.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  As soon as that judge lifts that, all this stuff goes away.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  32 terabytes of the whole election of November 3rd to November 6th.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  That's what I think they're afraid of.
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  But he goes, and then I said to him, I said,
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  is this about January 6th?
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  And they go, no, no, no, it's not about January 6th.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  I said, well, do you have other FBI guys
[41:35.000 --> 41:36.000]  that can tell that committee?
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  I've tried to tell that charade that I want to come there,
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  even though I wasn't there on January 6th.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  I want to bring the evidence there.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  I said, it's disgusting what they're doing.
[41:45.000 --> 41:48.000]  And then Alex, I said, you guys, you little FBI guys,
[41:48.000 --> 41:54.000]  do you guys realize that you FBI guys did a report from January 6th.
[41:54.000 --> 41:59.000]  On June 26th of 2021, everybody, almost over a year ago,
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  they did a six-month investigation into January 6th,
[42:02.000 --> 42:06.000]  and they said there's no collusion between Donald Trump
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  and his supporters.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  That should have been it.
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  But no, they put up this little January 6th charade,
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  keep people in prison that haven't done anything,
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  and it's disgusting.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  So this, you know, and then they finally go,
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  well, we're going to take your phone, and I go,
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  and you ain't getting my phone.
[42:24.000 --> 42:27.000]  You're going to have to arrest me before you're getting my phone.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  And then it was a whole other fiasco.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  Hold on, hold on.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  This is riveting, important, historic stuff, Mike Lindell.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  This is the Mass Purge Democrats from Hillary Clinton
[42:36.000 --> 42:37.000]  to members of Congress.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  We're on TV saying we've got to, quote,
[42:39.000 --> 42:40.000]  kill the MAGA movement.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  We've got to ban their speech.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  We've got to, I mean, these people are like dictators
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  in third world countries like Venezuela.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  This is so dangerous.
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  Mike Lindell from mypilla.com and mystore.com is our guest.
[42:52.000 --> 42:53.000]  Please stay with us.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  This guy's a real patriot.
[43:00.000 --> 43:01.000]  People ask me all the time,
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  what is your best new tropic?
[43:03.000 --> 43:05.000]  You've got turbo force.
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  You've got brain force plus,
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  and you've got brain force ultra.
[43:09.000 --> 43:10.000]  Which one is better?
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  And that's like asking, what's better,
[43:13.000 --> 43:19.000]  a Ford F-150 or a Cadillac or a Ferrari?
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[43:21.000 --> 43:23.000]  It varies.
[43:23.000 --> 43:25.000]  All three are different formulas.
[43:25.000 --> 43:27.000]  All three do different things.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean, out of control energy.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  Brain force plus is a long-term acting, clean, neutral.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  This brain force ultra is a super fast acting,
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  neutral pick that creates incredible clarity,
[43:45.000 --> 43:46.000]  but doesn't last very long.
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  They're all three different formulas.
[43:48.000 --> 43:51.000]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted,
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  brain force ultra is available at infowarstore.com.
[43:55.000 --> 43:59.000]  Brain force ultra back in stock, infowarstore.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  amongst the left.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  If you have a family member suffering
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  from this degenerative mental condition,
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  Studies have suggested that fish oils
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  decrease triglyceride levels,
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[44:27.000 --> 44:31.000]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  in joints and the digestive system.
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.000]  and activity of immune cells.
[44:45.000 --> 44:46.000]  It worked for my family,
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member,
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  We sold out of this for almost a year,
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  but we made a major purchase,
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  and it is now in stock for whatever your need is
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  or vbioprose.com.
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation,
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  it is amazing, and it funds the info war.
[45:59.000 --> 46:04.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year,
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  and I believe the most powerful,
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  the man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  Citizen of a republic, the man in the arena.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world.
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  It will never be made again.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  It funds the information war against the globalist.
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  This is something you want to own,
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  and as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  against the globalist.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.000]  Please be part of history, and thank you all for your support.
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com,

[46:49.000 --> 46:51.000]  and secure this coin.
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence,
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and it funds the info war.
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.

[47:44.000 --> 47:49.000]  The best part about my job is getting to know all these authentic,
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  genuine, salt-to-the-earth people like Mike Lindell.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  Like, I didn't know Mike Lindell was a hunter.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  He's not like a lot of these fake conservatives
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  that constantly show it on TV.
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  There's some cred thing.
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  I want to go duck hunting with Mike Lindell.
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  I haven't been duck hunting years.
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  He used to do a lot of that.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  That's some great hunting up there where he's at.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Arkansas is great as well.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  Many areas are great.
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  Now, by Houston, it's great.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  So, now look at the point.
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  They want your phone, and you're saying,
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  you're going to have to arrest me.
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  Please continue.
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  My company phone is the only phone I have.
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  And I said, I don't use a computer.
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  I use this phone for everything.
[48:28.000 --> 48:31.000]  I track media, everything in real time.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  I said, I have passwords on here that have to do money wire.
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  It runs my hearing aids.
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.000]  I have to have this for my hearing aids and everything else.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  And I said, for five different companies,
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  my billo, my store, Frank's Beach,
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  and my Lindell Recovery Network, I mean, to help addicts.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Anyway, I'm arguing.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  He goes, no, and I said, you're going to have to arrest me.
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  I said, if I don't give you the phone, will you arrest me?
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  And he goes, no, we're taking your phone.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  And I said, well, what?
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  And then he passed, he gives me these papers.
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.000]  He gives me these papers here where there's a warrant for my phone,
[49:06.000 --> 49:09.000]  a seizure warrant, a search and seizure, whatever it is.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  And I said, well, I said, I don't believe that.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  I said, how do I know that's real?
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  I said, I want to call my lawyer.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  And he says, no, you can't call a lawyer.
[49:17.000 --> 49:18.000]  And I said, what?
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  I said, I am calling a lawyer.
[49:20.000 --> 49:21.000]  I'm not giving you this.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  And then I got very upset.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  And he goes, all right, go ahead and call your lawyer.
[49:26.000 --> 49:30.000]  So now I call my lawyer and I get one of my lawyers on the phone.
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  And he goes, and he says, he goes, the FBI guy tells him
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.000]  he has whatever he had for this search and seizure,
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  this from a judge or whatever it was.
[49:42.000 --> 49:47.000]  And anyway, he goes, Mike, give him your phone.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  And I said, it was one of these things where I'm hanging on my phone.
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  I go, I'm not giving my phone.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  And I mean, it'd be the last thing I would ever give up.
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  Well, he talked me into it.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  My lawyer does say, give him the phone.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  And I'm going, OK, well, then they give me this sheet, Alex.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  This is this one here.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  They give me this sheet and I'm going to read it to people.
[50:07.000 --> 50:11.000]  This is an official criminal investigation conducted by an agency
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  of the United States and a federal grand jury in the district of Colorado.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  Now it goes on to say, we request that you do not disclose
[50:19.000 --> 50:23.000]  the existence of this subpoena for an indefinite period of time.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.000]  Although the law does not require non-disclosure unless a court order is issued,
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  we believe that the impact of you saying anything or disclosing
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  could be detrimental to the investigation.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  I'm going, OK.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.000]  Then it says, if you do not believe that you cannot comply with this request,
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  in other words, keep your mouth shut,
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  please notify the under-signed assistant United States attorney,
[50:45.000 --> 50:46.000]  Aaron Tiedelbaum.
[50:46.000 --> 50:50.000]  And I said, OK, I'll notify old Aaron.
[50:50.000 --> 50:54.000]  Alex, I went on my show at six o'clock on Lindale TV at Frank's Beach.
[50:54.000 --> 50:59.000]  And I said, Aaron, if you're watching, I'm telling you now and letting you know
[50:59.000 --> 51:04.000]  I'm telling the whole world what you're corrupted with the FBI
[51:04.000 --> 51:09.000]  and came after citizens and doing what you're doing to our country.
[51:09.000 --> 51:12.000]  So I went public, as you know, and then it went everywhere.
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  So, and finally...
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  Well, Mike, I can't think of anybody who's more Americana than you
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  and you're a great American and we love you
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  and they're persecuting all of us together.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  These massive dragnets, they're panicking.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  They're trying to get ready to steal the next election of 54 days.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  I think you're dead on.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  They are scared of the proof of what you've discovered.
[51:30.000 --> 51:31.000]  Can you speak to that?
[51:31.000 --> 51:32.000]  Yeah.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  Well, they're very worried, everybody, and I want everybody to know.
[51:36.000 --> 51:42.000]  You know, I've had Dennis Montgomery's terabytes for the last year and a half
[51:42.000 --> 51:46.000]  and there's a reason at the Cyber Symposium that we were advised
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  not to put out the China thing and all the terabytes
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  on the third day a year ago at the Cyber Symposium.
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.000]  So everybody, at the moment of true summit, right on stage
[51:57.000 --> 52:01.000]  we had the attorney up there and he told you why we could not drop them
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  at that time to the public.
[52:03.000 --> 52:06.000]  There's a government gag order on this information.
[52:06.000 --> 52:11.000]  I don't believe that that will stop me from putting it out there
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  because now I own all this stuff and I bought the different stuff
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  that patents that Dennis Montgomery has
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  and one of the smartest men I've ever known, by the way.
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  And we filed it right on stage, Alex.
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  It's sitting in Nevada.
[52:27.000 --> 52:36.000]  Case number 3, 06-CVcatvictor-00056, everybody.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  You can go look it up or you can go to DennisMontgomery.com
[52:40.000 --> 52:43.000]  and see that, oh, Dennis is real.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  He worked for the government.
[52:44.000 --> 52:48.000]  He made this thing called Hammer Scorecard for the government
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  to steal elections, amongst other things.
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  That's what our government was going to do spy on other elections around the world.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  But our government turned it on the United States,
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  turned us on our own people and now it's sitting.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  The government doesn't want you to see this, everybody.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  And that government is sitting down there.
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  If that judge releases this to the public,
[53:09.000 --> 53:13.000]  if they release this to the public, it's over, everybody.
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  So Mike, they're definitely scared of you.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  They're trying to shut you down.
[53:18.000 --> 53:19.000]  They're trying to shut me down.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  So the listeners, the viewers, Mike Lindell, Alex Jones
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  are all in a symbiotic defense pack here.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  You need money to keep your employees hired
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  and fighting on the great job you're doing.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  We need funds.
[53:29.000 --> 53:30.000]  You've been a big sponsor.

[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  and not just your items with all these other

[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  But your new website as well.
[53:48.000 --> 53:52.000]  Yeah, at MyPillow.com, everybody, we put everything on there.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  When we were canceled like Walmart,
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  you can get the pillows for 1988, the standard size,
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  using that promo code Alex.
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  The slippers there, $49.98, and the sandals at low as $19.98.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  We passed all that savings onto you.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  We need the support right now about everything.
[54:10.000 --> 54:13.000]  There you have our towel sets, all these things that are on there.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  These are the MyPillow.com.
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  Using that promo code Alex,
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  you get the biggest discounts in the country.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  We have mattress systems.
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  I have my own mattresses I developed,
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  100% made in the USA.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  And the prices are 100% made in the USA,
[54:28.000 --> 54:29.000]  already incredible pricing.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  And it funds the InfoWare.
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  And you've got a new site you've launched as well.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  This is what the FBI prevented me from by doing all that stuff.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  Mancato, I couldn't get to these entrepreneurs.
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  This new site is MyStore.com, everybody.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  And it is for entrepreneurs and USA Made products.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  Every good entrepreneur has a story.
[54:51.000 --> 54:54.000]  One of the things we went on there is this family owned business,
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  the My Coffee.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  This is the best coffee you will ever have in your life.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  And as you go down here, these are all entrepreneurs.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  You see behind me Vanessa, the paintings.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  You see how there's the coffee.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  It is the best coffee in history.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  There's nothing better.
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.000]  You can get this as a family owned business.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  They have fields in Honduras.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  It goes from the fields to the coffee.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  They micromanage every part of this coffee.
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  There's nothing better.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  MyStore.com, get big discounts with promo code A-L-E-X.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  That keeps us on air.
[55:25.000 --> 55:26.000]  It keeps you fighting.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  You're the man on the arena.
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.000]  People ask us to fight tyranny.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  They ask men and women to stand up.
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  We're doing it because we love liberty.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  We're not trying to be heroes, but we have a burning desire
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  for liberty and justice.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  We don't want to be controlled or enslaved.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  And you're one of the main leaders out there that they attack.
[55:39.000 --> 55:40.000]  They demonize.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  They make fun of.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  But I'm just telling you, Mike Lindell, we love you.
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.000]  And we appreciate you.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  MyStore.com, MyPilla.com, promo code Alex.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  That way we get some support as well.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  In closing, what else do you want to add?
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  Well, you know, everybody, yes, we do need support.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  And my employees and all the entrepreneurs really thank you.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  All these products, USA Made on MyStore.com,
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  it's a safe platform in lieu of Amazon,
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  where your products get copied by China.
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  Or you go on Suckerbox Facebook and they get copied all these places.
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  It's a safe platform for these entrepreneurs
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  and these USA Made products.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  I want to work with you.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  I want to put our products on MyStore.com.
[56:19.000 --> 56:20.000]  Can we do that?
[56:20.000 --> 56:21.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  Get them up there any time you want.
[56:23.000 --> 56:24.000]  Give me a holler.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  Because I'll tell you what, everybody,
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  your support out there of MyStore and MyPilla,
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  it enables me to go out there
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  and keep putting tens of millions of dollars.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  I've got over $35 million into this fight.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  Oh, and the FBI asks why you're flying around.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  I've never seen so much energy.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  Every couple of days you're giving speeches,
[56:41.000 --> 56:44.000]  you're funding research, you're just all over the map.
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  We're taking on Soros, the New World Order, folks.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  That's why you want us in the field.
[56:48.000 --> 56:49.000]  You want action.
[56:49.000 --> 56:50.000]  You want results.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  You're getting it with Mike Lindell and Alex Jones.
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  MyStore.com.
[56:53.000 --> 56:57.000]  MyStore.com or MyPilla.com, promo code Alex.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  Mike, you've got to join us again soon.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  But Godspeed and thank you so much.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  30-second closing comment.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  Well, thanks, everybody.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  And I want everybody to keep the faith.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  God's had his hand in all of this.
[57:08.000 --> 57:11.000]  Everything we're going to look back and we're going to see.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  Everything had to happen just the way it happened
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  to get to this great place you're going.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.000]  I want everybody courageous, contagious, stay courageous.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  And I'll tell you what, everybody pray for our judges.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  Pray for our judges and our sheriffs.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  Sheriffs have the power in your county
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  to get rid of these machines.
[57:29.000 --> 57:32.000]  And the judges need to quit kicking stuff out to standing.
[57:32.000 --> 57:35.000]  Tell these judges, pray that they actually be the judges
[57:35.000 --> 57:38.000]  they need to be and actually make decisions
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  rather than say, I don't want to look at it
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  because they're in fear.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  Thank you all. God bless and thank you, Alex,
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  for having me on and keep the faith.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  You're doing a great job, Alex. God bless.
[57:48.000 --> 57:49.000]  Thank you, sir.
[57:49.000 --> 57:52.000]  The rage for more than a decade
[57:52.000 --> 57:57.000]  have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  and so many other ingredients that are known
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  to make us healthy, to make us vibrant,
[58:02.000 --> 58:05.000]  and to defend our immune systems.
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago,
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[58:09.000 --> 58:12.000]  top of the line, as good as it's going to get,
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules, this big old bottle,
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  jam-packed, is back in stock for a limited time

[58:36.000 --> 58:39.000]  What's just as amazing is it funds the info war
[58:39.000 --> 58:40.000]  and keeps us on air.
[58:40.000 --> 58:42.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[58:42.000 --> 58:44.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[58:44.000 --> 58:45.000]  that are in this product.
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  Get yours today at 25% off
[58:47.000 --> 58:50.000]  at infowarstore.com, now back in stock.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[58:54.000 --> 58:55.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[58:55.000 --> 58:58.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  that's wild harvested above organic
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  that the media calls communists,
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  and we've got it.
[59:14.000 --> 59:16.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[59:20.000 --> 59:21.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  for about 50% more per pound.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[59:27.000 --> 59:28.000]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[59:32.000 --> 59:34.000]  I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[59:36.000 --> 59:38.000]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[59:38.000 --> 59:39.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[59:43.000 --> 1:00:02.000]  And if you don't find us and don't want to stare, that's fine.
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  Just how dishonest is the New York Times?
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  It's really a philosophical question.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  It's hard to answer directly.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Let's see.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  How drunk was the guy you saw passed out
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  in the men's room at a Packers' Game?
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  How angry is Hillary Clinton at her husband?
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Well, the answer in all cases is very,
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  extremely, so thoroughly and so totally
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  that it's hard to put into words.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  So instead of describing the dishonesty
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  of the New York Times with conventional adjectives,
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  we'll give you a specific example
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  because we think it tells you more.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  So last week, paper told us that the best-selling book
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  in the United States was a title called
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  I'm Glad My Mom Died
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  by a child actress called Jeanette McCurdy.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  But that was not true.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  That book was not the best-selling book in America.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  In fact, the best-selling book in America last week
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  was The Great Reset and the War for the Worlds
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  written by Alex Jones.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Jones sold one in 56,000 copies of his book last week.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  Jeanette McCurdy, whatever her merits,
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  we have no idea, sold 34,686 copies of her book.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  So Alex Jones sold a lot more books.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Alex Jones had the biggest book in the country,
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  but the New York Times lied about that
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  because the New York Times doesn't want you to know that.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  The New York Times wants you to believe
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  that Alex Jones is more discredited than the New York Times.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  The paper that started the Iraq War
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  by lying about weapons mass destruction
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  and got a million people killed.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  But Alex Jones is worse.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  He's a mental patient. No one listens to him.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  So they lied about his book.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  What else are they lying about?
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  You'll wonder.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Since you mentioned The Great Reset and the War for the World
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  that you champion, and I really appreciate you reading it,
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  it's mainly, it was easy to write,
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  it's their quotes, it's their battle plan.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  What if people would have read Mein Kampf that Hitler wrote?
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Everything he said in the book, he did.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  Well, this is their Mein Kampf.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  This is their admissions right here.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  This is their confessions.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  That's why I call it the blueprint of the Death Star.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  No, listen, here's the beauty of the book.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  You actually quote them at length.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  You take a couple of the top books,
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  you take a couple of the top thinkers,
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  you tie it all together,
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  and this is what people have to understand.
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Look, once you read this,
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  you'll understand what we're up against, okay?
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  You'll understand exactly what this apparatus, you know,
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  what Alex calls it, the Death Star,
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  but you'll understand what we're up against.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And we're not going to back off this.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  We can't back off it.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  The United States is actually the centerpiece of this battle,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  because they understand, just like in the Revolutionary War,
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  if they can take the liberty and freedom of American citizens,
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  they can take it anywhere.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  And that's why you have to fight back.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And by the way, Alex, I not just read it, I tell everybody,
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  get a pen.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  I always get my great pens here.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  I had my pen and I'm underlining everything.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  And here's the beauty of it.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Use footnote everything.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  This is not Alex Jones' opinions.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  What Alex Jones' team has done is pulled it all together.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  It's all referenced right there.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  You can go to a footnote.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  I know you've got an online site about it, too.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  That's why I think Tony Lyons, the guys at Sky Horse,
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  did such a great job.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  But listen, once you read this book, you'll understand
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  why the Alex Jones' and the Steve Bannon's are not going to back off.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  There's all kind of other things we could do.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  There's all kind of other things Trump could do.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  There's all kind of other things Tucker Carlson could do.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  We're all in this fight.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Make sure signed copy of the number one book in America
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  and help keep Infowars on the air.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  The Great Reset in the War for the World by Alex Jones.

[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  InfowarsStore.com.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  Oh, no, no, no.
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  I don't even know what this is.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  How's the skin here?
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  I just caught you, American.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  You visit a Band-Aid video.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:50.000]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Band-Aid video,
[1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  or I have to hurt you.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  Ah.
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  It comes from China.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an information war
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  to have the number one book in the world which it is today
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  and not just in the U.S. is a giant victory.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  Thank you all.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  You're ongoing support in what you've done.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  So much news, so much reading info.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  We'll be covering it all next segment.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  But you can buy the book in any major bookstore,
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  though I'm told they're sold out.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  They'd be even a bigger bestseller,
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  but they can't print them fast enough.
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  But if you really want to support Infowars,
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  you get immediate money in their operation, we need.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  It's a fundraiser just like MPR charges,
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  you know, 200 bucks for a t-shirt,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  100 bucks for a ball cap,
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  50 bucks for a coffee cup.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  You know, they get taxpayer money.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  We don't get taxpayer money.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  They need that to operate their enemy operation.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  Well, we're doing this with the markup on the signed books,
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  which we're offering because we got the other ones out.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  They've now, as of today, all the pre-order books
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  and all the signed books I got behind a couple weeks.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  They've all been shipped.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Thanks to those of you that got them.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  You've either gotten them or they're on their way to you
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  in the mail right now,
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  but now we're offering limited signed books again
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  exclusively at infoworkstore.com.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  The rage for more than a decade
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  have been concentrated green powders
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  with wheatgrass and so many other ingredients
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  that are known to make us healthy,
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  to make us vibrant, and to defend our immune systems.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  Now, over a year and a half ago,
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  we came out with a product that was top sourced,
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  top of the line, as good as it's going to get,
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules,
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  this big old bottle, jam-packed,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  is back in stock for a limited time
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  at infoworkstore.com, 30% off.

[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  to go into all the great things it does
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  or what it has inside,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  but go to infoworkstore.com
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  and look up green fiber capsules for yourself
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  and see how amazing it is,
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  and what's just as amazing is
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  it funds the info war and keeps us on air.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  We're all under globalist attack.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  that are in this product.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  Get yours today at 25% off

[1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Hi, we've got a lot of news to cover in this second hour.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Ahead of a human health and human services
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  scientist that was an advisor to Trump
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  who warned him about Operation Warp Speed
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  and tried to get the different treatments
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  out there that were natural.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  We have a special guest joining us coming up
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  in the third hour today.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And then, of course, Jason Burmes will also be hosting
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  with a lot of news he's breaking in the fourth hour,
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Dr. Paul E. Alexander in studio
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:16.000]  with huge breaking news coming up next hour.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  But we have to illustrate the insane absurdity
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  and hypocrisy and just naked corruption
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  of the Democratic Party and the globalist
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  U.N. operation to break our borders
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  by collapsing the third world and flooding us.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  And so the Texas Governor and the Santas
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.000]  have been shipping plane loads and bus loads
[1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  of the millions of illegals just a few thousand a week.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:44.000]  To Chicago, to New York,
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  but now they're shipping them to elitist enclaves
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  like Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  where Barack Obama and many other globalists live
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  and they are freaking out saying,
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  how dare you, this is terrible.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  I mean, imagine, they don't keep their mouth shut.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  They think their own constituents won't understand
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  that America's being flooded by millions of illegals a month.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  It's five, six times even what Obama did.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Estimates are 10 million a year
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  just coming through Texas alone.
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  Almost all of them just let in.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  Many of them are smuggling kidnapped kids.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  And so now they're not busing little kids
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  that have been kidnapped,
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  but the Democrats are all over the country.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  They're shipping men, men to all these different places.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  That's smart of the Santas and of Abbott
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  to not be involved in the trafficking of children.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  But if you're going to come here illegally,
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  if DHS is going to let them go,
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  we're going to put them on buses and say,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  hey, you're not going to South Side Chicago
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  or South Dallas.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  And I mean, talking super dangerous places
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  like South Dallas and South Chicago.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  You aren't going to the Bronx.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  You're not going to Harlem.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  You're not going to D.C.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  You are going to Martha's Vineyard
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  or you're going to Kamala Harris's house.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Texas governor drops busloads of migrants, illegal aliens,
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  off outside Kamala Harris's residence.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Two buses of migrants that my Texas governor Abbott
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  arrived on Thursday morning outside
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris's residence
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  in Washington, D.C.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Fox News reports.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  We just showed you that of your TV viewer.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  Ron DeSantis sends two planes of illegal immigrants
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  to Martha's Vineyard.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  And how did John Brennan,
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  former head of the CIA and filmmaker,
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  Ken Burns,
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  John Berman,
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  not the CIA, John Berman,
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  excuse me, I got that mixed up.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  How did John Berman and filmmaker,
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  Ken Burns, how did they spin that?
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  They said DeSantis,
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  they've told to come here.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  Remember, Biden said, come here, come here, flood the border.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Remember, that guy's find that quote.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  We don't play that in probably a year.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  It was like two years ago.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  He's about to steal the election.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  And he gets up and he says, once I get elected,
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  I want you to literally flood
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  the United States.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  They all show up at the millions wearing Biden shirts.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  I mean, that is so incredible.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  And then Kamala Harris says, oh, there is no broken border.
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  There's no problem.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  So John Berman and filmmaker, Ken Burns,
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  they liken this to the Holocaust.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  So shipping people to Kamala Harris' house,
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  shipping people to Martin's Vineyard,
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  to Barack Obama's house, it's the Holocaust.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Now,
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  when people talk about genocide in Africa,
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  the ADL says, don't you liken the genocide in Africa
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  to the Holocaust?
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  Nothing's as bad as the Holocaust.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  I think the Holocaust was terrible. I think Hitler was bad.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  But no, mass murder is mass murder.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Genocide is genocide.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  This is bad whether it happens to an African or a Jewish person or anybody.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  I think we basically agree on that.
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  The fact is now likening
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  January 6 to worse than Pearl Harbor,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  worse than 9-11,
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  preposterous, ridiculous.
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  And now they're likening, questioning
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  the flooding of the country and then
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  shipping people to elitist areas
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  as the Holocaust. Here it is.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  This is history.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  All of your documentaries are about history.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Yeah.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  But all of them also make you think
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  about where we are now.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Let's look up to the news this morning
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  that Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  sent two plain loads of migrants
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  to Martha's Vineyard
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  off the coast of Massachusetts,
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  including kids and whatnot.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And I'm not saying this is not a one-for-one.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  This is not a parallel here in any way.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  But it does address some of the same themes
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  that are part of this documentary.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  Well, it's the abstraction of human life.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  It's basically saying that you can use
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  a human life that is as valuable
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  as yours or mine or limbs
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  and to put it in a position
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  of becoming a political pawn
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  in somebody's authoritarian game.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  This is coming straight out of
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  the authoritarian playbook.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  This is what's so disturbing about DeSantis
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  is to use human beings
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  to weaponize human beings
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  for a political purpose.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  It's like when somebody disagrees with him
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  in Florida, like the Walt Disney Company,
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  he punishes them.
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  This is not the actions of
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  a person participating in a democratic process
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  in which there's an exchange of ideas.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  This is about punishing political enemies,
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  putting on shows,
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  political shows, political theater.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  And in this case,
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  this is with the lives of human beings.
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And what's so ironic is these are
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Venezuelan refugees,
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  which DeSantis should be supporting
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  because they're trying to flee
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  the corruption of a left-wing government
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  and all of the pain there.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  And so the level of cynicism
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  is beyond that.
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  And one of the things we see in these films
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  is that the themes that we engage
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  in the past are present today.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  And so when you look
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  at the story that we're telling
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  of the U.S. and the Holocaust,
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  you understand that
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  the time to save a democracy
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  is before it's lost.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  We promise you.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Ken Burns-Linovic, I want people to watch this.
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  It is wonderful.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  You are guaranteed to learn something.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Even people who think they know everything.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  Like Hippocrates have ever seen.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  The Democrats are surveilling speech.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  They're censoring it.
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  The Democrats are bullying their political opponents
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  and debanking them.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  The Democrats have FBI raids
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  on thousands of people,
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  and 800 held in solitary confinement.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  Many of them totally peaceful,
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  awaiting kangaroo trials.
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  And then he says
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  that the Republicans
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  are using people as political pawns
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  when the left's telling these people
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  to vote illegally
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  and to take jobs in lower wages
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  as a permanent underclass.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  That's what fascists do.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  And he sits there with a straight face
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  while everything he's saying
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  that the
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Republicans are doing
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  is exactly
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  what he's doing in that little sweet
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  smart mouth
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  NPR voice.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  He's saying like a little snake, go to sleep.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  I'm your friend.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Everything's fine.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  It's just unspeakably
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  ridiculous
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  if you're actually informed
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  and you know what's going on.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  So,
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  let's go to this next clip.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  This is Florida.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  DeSantis sends planes with migrants
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  to Martha's Vineyard. Here it is.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  This morning,
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  a surprising scene in Martha's Vineyard.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  Two planes filled with about 50 migrants
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  landing on the island
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  by emergency management officials.
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  Authorities say the planes were sent
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  from Florida Wednesday afternoon
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  by Governor Ron DeSantis.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  This video provided by DeSantis's office,
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  which says it was
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  obtained by a source on the ground,
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  appears to show the migrants arrival
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  on the island.
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  DeSantis's office saying the planes
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  were part of the state's relocation program
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  to transport illegal
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  immigrants to sanctuary destinations.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Adding
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  states like Massachusetts, New York
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  and California will better
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  facilitate the care of these individuals
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  who they have invited
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  into our country by incentivizing
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  illegal immigration.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  This is really clearly a
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  political stunt.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Republican Governor DeSantis
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  borrowing a tactic from other
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Republican governors, moving
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  migrants to other states
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  in order to protest.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  So, the only problem with this is it's not enough.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  It's not enough to ship a couple hundred a week
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  to D.C. and to
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Chicago and to Martha's Vineyard.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  Ship them all.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  Ship them to Martha's Vineyard,
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  that elitist snob
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  place
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  where the Black Lives Matter are going to live
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  because it's 99% white.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Send them all there.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  They don't want to deal with them. They want to hide from the rest of everybody.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  And it'll shut down
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  very, very quickly.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  I mean, I want
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  to absolutely ship.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I mean, what, they're saying it's a million a month?
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  Let's do it in Texas, Arizona,
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  Florida. Let's start shipping
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  a million a month to New York, D.C.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  and Martha's Vineyard in Chicago.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  And this will end overnight. They can't even handle
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  a few thousand a week.
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  High
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  New
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  Black Lives Matter
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  People ask me all the time, what is your best
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  new tropic? You've got turbo force.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  You've got Brain Force Plus
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  and you've got Brain Force Ultra.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  Which one is better?
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  And that's like asking
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  what's better, a Ford F-150
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  or a Cadillac
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  or a Ferrari.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  It's different strokes
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  for different folks. It varies
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  all three different formulas
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  all three do different things.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  out of control energy.
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Brain Force Plus is a
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  long-term acting clean
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  new tropic. This Brain Force Ultra
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  is a super fast acting
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  new tropic that
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  creates incredible clarity
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  but doesn't last very long. They're all
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  three different formulas. And finally

[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  for every part of your body.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  But what I don't see being
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  promoted is the fact that it has
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  natural
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  psychotropic effects.
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  It certainly does for me.
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules an hour before bed
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  my sleep, my dreams
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  are amazing.
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  linking it to amazing
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  events in the brain.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  But I want you to experience it yourself.

[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  To be able to
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  do things tax wise
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  that's legal and lawful, that allows you to keep
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  more of your money. We wouldn't even be here
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  in the last few years.
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  The only way you fail is not
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  writing down the URL
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  jonestaxrelief.com
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  or call
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  833-900-4285
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  833-900-4285
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  Alex Jones
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  The left thinks that they try to bully us
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  and intimidate us
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  and makes us coward.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  They don't know that we will love a fight.
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  Grim the wheel
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  is the knuffles in white we desire.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  The wheels in this Mustang
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  exploding on the highway
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  like a slow from a 45
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  to death
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  400 horsepower of maximum performance
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  piercing the night.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  This is black sunshine.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  Yeah, 400 horsepower of a Mustang
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  is pretty good. I used to have a Mustang like that
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  in Greenless.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  I was a college
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  try a thousand
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  Dodge Hemi horsepower
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  with twin
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  superchargers.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  Zero to 16
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  about a second and a half
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  even beat one of them Tesla's
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  dangerous
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  200 miles an hour
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  in about 8 seconds
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  that's black sunshine.
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  You're not going to see a leftist
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  press down the accelerator
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  shooting down that tollway
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  at 1 a.m. at 200 miles an hour
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  not that I've ever done it.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  They just don't get it.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  We are in the arena
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  and we are alive.
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  And being alive means
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  you know you're going to die.
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  Finally.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  High noon.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  Nothing matters.
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Back top.
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  You don't
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  live until you're ready to die.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  You don't win until you
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  try and fail and fail
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  and succeed and fail and
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  succeed again.
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  All right.
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  You know I sit here with
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  a great audience of supporters
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  and Mike Lindell is a great guy.
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  He's got a big support base
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  and we're still tough.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  We're being persecuted but
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  I think about people who was in my studio
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  a year and a half ago
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  like Jeremy Brown
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  who had a great distinguished 20-plus year
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  career in Special Forces
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  he had all sorts of missions for this country
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  all over the world, humanitarian you name it
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  and he wouldn't be an informant
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  against the Oathkeepers
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  before January 6th.
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  He tried to stop the violence
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  of the Capitol as well on record
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  and so they've grabbed him
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  and almost a year and a half later
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  he's in a maximum security gulok
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  and if they can do that
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  to Jeremy Brown, they can do that
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  to everybody. Here is the Gregory
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  Supported at Bandot Video.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  I hope you share it.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Green Beret running for office
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  and podcasting live
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  security gel cell. Here it is.
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  Mr. Olson, on January 6th,
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  2021, did the Department of Justice
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  or FBI have any plainclothes
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  officers among the crowd
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  at the Capitol?
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  Senator, I'm not aware
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  of whether or not there were
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  plainclothes officers
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  among the crowd
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  at the Capitol on July 6th.
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  On January 6th.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  Did any plainclothes officers
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  enter the Capitol on January 6th?
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  I don't know the answer to that, Senator.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  Did any FBI agents or
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:55.000]  confidential informants commit crimes
[1:23:55.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  of violence on January 6th?
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  6th. I can't answer that, sir.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:01.000]  Did any FBI agents
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  or FBI informants
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  actively encourage
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  and incite crimes of
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  violence on January 6th?
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:11.000]  Sir, I can't answer that.
[1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:13.000]  While Congress asks
[1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  questions and the Department
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  of Justice plays dumb,
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  millions of us are well aware
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  that the DOJ was responsible
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  for the riots at the Capitol
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  on January 6th, that resulted
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  in the prosecution of over
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  800 peaceful protesters and
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  the death of four, including
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  the brutal execution of Ashley
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Babin. They did it with people
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  like Ray Epps and other
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  unindicted co-conspirators
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  who instigated violence within the
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  crowd. And thanks to Americans
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  like Jeremy Brown, we know
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  how they found these unindicted
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  co-conspirators to betray
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  their own country in a would-be
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Reichstag fire for America.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  Right after Jeremy Brown
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  joined the Oathkeepers in late
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  2020, the Department of Homeland
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  Security, along with the FBI's
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  Joint Terrorism Task Force
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  showed up at his door to try
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  recruiting him to spy on them.
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  Jeremy agreed to meet with the
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  federal agents at a local restaurant
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  where he recorded the conversation.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  In the audio, we can hear the feds
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  attempting to recruit Jeremy
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  with bribery tactics.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  And again, I can't make any promises,
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  but like, you provide information
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  to prevent something big. The government
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  pays for that. And with
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  intimidation and extortion.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  We think that we can help, you can
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  help us and we can definitely
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  provide information.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  And these two feds tell Jeremy
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  that he is only one of 19 people
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  they are assigned to.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  You're one of 19 people
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  that are going to knock on the door
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:47.000]  and say they're not home or they are
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  home and we can just talk at some point.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  We can meet on a monthly basis.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:53.000]  We can chat when things are open,
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  get a coffee.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  After going public with this information,
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  Jeremy Brown is then arrested
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  by these same federal agents
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  and then put in maximum security prison
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  where he remains to this day.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  Jeremy Brown served
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  17 years as a Green Beret
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  and staying true to the Special Forces
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  Creed to teach and fight
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  wherever required to excel
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  in every art and artifice of war
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  to perform tasks in isolation
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  and if captured
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  to have the strength to spit upon the enemy.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  Brown is now podcasting live
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  from Pinellas County
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  maximum security prison
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  in Clearwater, Florida
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  at 10 a.m. Monday through Friday
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  on Jeremy Brown campaign
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  at rumble.com.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  Jeremy Brown is also running
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  for Florida State Representative
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  in District 62
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  where he is running against Michelle
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  Rainer who describes herself
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  as a cisgender queer woman
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  with pronouns she, they.
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  We have a governor and we have a legislature
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  that is out of control.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  They have drawn maps that are racist
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  that are partisan
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  and that I believe in quite frankly
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  many people believe are illegal.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  Thanks to Americans like Jeremy Brown
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  who refuse to give up on our freedoms
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  we are winning the information war.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  So support him
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  vote for him and follow his podcast
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  and never forget
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  the innocent Americans
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  who are still to this day locked
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  in the DC gulag
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  for protesting a rigged election.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  We have to acknowledge
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  what is happening in this country
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  and what is happening in this country
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  is that military
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  great weapons and tactics
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  are being used against the people
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  because America
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  is the final
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  roadblock
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  to global tyranny.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  I hope that this podcast
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  can bring a little bit of knowledge
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  to you so that you
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  die at a nice healthy
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  ripe old age
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  and not at the hands
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  of some tyrant who has used
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  your old ignorance to enslave
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  torture and murder you.
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  Reporting for Info Wars
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  this is Greg Rees
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  So there is a globalist takeover happening
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  at Info Wars audience
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  as seen as the number one enemy
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  by the new world order.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  There are people that care
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  there are people that are informed
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  people that are involved
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  for those that have rolled over to this
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  it only gets worse
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  we're all in this together
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  and that's why
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  realizing how intense the moment is
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  because we've been incrementally
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  like the frog in the pot brought to this point
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  and we don't stand up now
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  and don't speak out now which people are doing
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  they're going to win right now the enemy is losing
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  they're throwing everything
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  they've got at us and that is exposing them
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  in the process.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  Let's shift gears to World War 3
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  the situation in Ukraine
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  and the attempt at assassination a lot of them are putting when they come back.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  All three do different things
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Turbo Force is 10 hours of clean
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  out of control energy
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  Brain Force Plus is a
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  long term acting clean

[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  that creates incredible clarity
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  but doesn't last very long
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  they're all three different formulas

[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  but then the supply chain broke down
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  and it was sold out for more than a year

[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  of marital splits
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  is that there is problems

[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  men have is a rectile dysfunction

[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  good love and relationships

[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  Alright, I'm going to go to World War 3 here
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  But I want to fire the bat signal again to listeners
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  Because we are barely finding the operations

[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  I told you the supply chain broke down
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  Last year and a half we got way behind
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  We got in the hole
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  Finally, it sure it up for a little while
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  Now it's going back where it was
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  We got a bunch of products

[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  We're launching right now
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  With all these trials and tribulations
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  We're up against is the Teddy Roosevelt
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  Man of the Arena
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  One-of-a-kind limited edition coin

[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  At a critical time
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  Everybody go to 1776coin.com
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And don't procrastinate
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  This is critical
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  All right
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  The globalist started the war in Ukraine
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000]  And I said back when it started
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  This is a trap
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  I said maybe they'll fall
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  But I said it's probably going to become
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  A quagmire
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000]  The so-called U.S. government run
[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  Of the globalist is putting a billion dollars
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  A week of weapons into Ukraine
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  Incredibly high-tech weapons
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  One man team should carry two to three little drones
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  They're GPS controlled by the CIA
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  And Pentagon and they fly out
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  And they kill these people
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  I mean it is just insane
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  And so the Russians more and more
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Threatening tactical nuclear weapons
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  In Ukraine they're now targeting civilians
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  They're now targeting power stations
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  This is the first time
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  This is a radical escalation
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  If you study Russian doctrine
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  Or NATO doctrine
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  This is the same
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000]  This goes to nuclear war
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  I talked to so many top military experts
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  They concur with my analysis
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  So you have an attempt at assassination
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  To Putin we learned a month ago
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  The Ukrainians are bragging
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  The Russians confirm it
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  You've got all these other Russian leaders
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  Getting killed
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  20 plus Russian generals being killed
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  This is how you get a nuclear war
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  So we just keep thinking
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  Things are going to go on forever
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  But it can end very, very quickly
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  This is on infowars.com
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  To third world war
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  Kremlin reacts to security guarantees
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  For Ukraine
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  It says NATO promising security guarantees
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  Is an active war by NATO
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  And they may go to nuclear war with NATO
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  I mean this is just absolutely insane
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  Breaking assassination attempt
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  Of Vladimir Putin's tensions
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  Escalate in Ukraine
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  Here's CNN
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Recent attacks on pro-Russian officials
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  In the southern Ukraine
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  Indicate signs of growing resistance movement
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:51.000]  Putin's ally dies of stroke
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  In Russia's far east
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  And it just goes on from there
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  So if you want to be concerned
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  And I know I am
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  This is what people should really, really be concerned about
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  Because this is a big, big deal
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  And it's insanely dangerous
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  And it's like everything that control freaks
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Running the Justice Department
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  Running the Pentagon
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  Do is they've never been challenged
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  No one's ever stood up to them
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  And so they just continue on
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  They're starting war with China
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  I hate the Communist Chinese
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  But that's insane
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  They're starting war with Russia
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  That's insane
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  They're dissolving our borders
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  They're annihilating our currency
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  We're going to raise interest rates
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  The Federal Reserve's announced next week
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  The biggest level in 20 years
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  That's going to kill the housing market
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  And even though it's a bubble
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  It's the bubble that keeps the economy going
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  So the establishment is annihilating
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  The economy to consolidate power
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  And they expect crime
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:57.000]  They expect violence
[1:39:57.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  They expect riots
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  It's in the IMF World Bank documents
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  We got in 2002
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  I wrote a book about it
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  Descent to Tearing
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  How they would next do it to the western world
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  And now they're doing it
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  And what's crazy is
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Almost all the bureaucrats are lawyers
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  Almost all of them are actually never in the military
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  They've never been in a fist fight
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  Much less kill somebody with their bare hands
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  And they just don't understand
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  What they're conjuring
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Chivalry is there by the most violent societies
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Because they've been through hell
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  And they want to protect women and children
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  But only people disconnected
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  From the real violence of the universe
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  And the veneer of civilization being destroyed
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  Only people like that do things like this
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  This has destruction and war and collapse
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  And famine and possible human extinction
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Written all over it
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  So the world even top analysts admit
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  You have the International Doomsday clocks
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  The closest to midnight's ever been
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  Worse than the Cuban Missile Crisis
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  Worse than any case in history
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  And we are on the precipice of total destruction
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  We're on the eve of destruction
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  We're at the dawn of destruction
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  And you've got all these delusional bureaucrats
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  And criminals at every level
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  That just feel like it's going to go on forever
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Because criminals have a blind spot
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  To think 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 2100 steps ahead
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  But anybody that can look 5, 6, 7, 8 steps ahead
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  Understands if you get rid of the rules of war
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  If you engage in unrestricted warfare
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  If you engage in criminal activities
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  If you commit crimes
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  You're going to undermine your own system
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  And people are going to use those tactics against you
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  These tactics have been illegal
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  For hundreds of years for a reason
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  Because every time the tactics of total war are used
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  You get that total war
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  And the truth is when you push people too far
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  And you commit massive crimes
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  You reap the whirlwind
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  Look at this headline
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  They're replacing every major CEO with operatives
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  That will go against even the profit motive
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  And cut the economy off
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Hundreds of food processing plants have been blown up
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  This is on infowars.com
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  Shell's CEO soon replaced by renewables, boss
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  Even though they don't have the renewables in 100 years
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  They're not replacing it
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  They're ending the energy system
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  They're collapsing civilization
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  But the good news is from Australia to New Zealand
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  To Canada to US to Europe and our militaries
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  US Navy quietly cancels vaccine requirement
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  For Navy SEALs because too many were quitting
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  And that's the good news is
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  They held the line and said no
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  More of us should do it
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  I saw a video out of the UK
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  I went to play yesterday
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  If I get that video ready
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:58.000]  I'll tell you about when I come back at a shopping center
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  Does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  For your brain, for every part of your body
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  But what I don't see being promoted
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  Is the fact that it has natural psychotropic effects
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  It certainly does for me
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.000]  From an hour before bed
[1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  My sleep, my dreams are amazing
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  Linking it to amazing events in the brain
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.000]  But I want you to experience it for yourself
[1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  We know it's good for your heart
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  We know it's good for your brain
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins and your lungs
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  And every other function in your body
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  But I want you to experience this high grade fish oil
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  This ultimate fish oil at mfortwardstore.com
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  And see what it does if you take it before bedtime
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  Ultimate fish oil, 50% off
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  Now exclusively available at mfortwardstore.com
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  Thank you all for your support
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  And with spiritual warfare
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  And with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  It's all come out
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  And they're doing that
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  Not because we're weak
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  But because we're made the image of God
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  The creator and we are powerful
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  That nobody knows who first came up with the boy
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  Is it true?
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  If the situation was hopeless
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  They need all their propaganda
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  And all their lies and all their evil
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  And all their cultural death
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  Because they know we are strong
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  And they know in the end
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  They signed on to God of this world
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  Who is a loser
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  And that's why it's so important
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  That everybody keep them full wars in the air
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  Now more than ever
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  What the globalists are manifesting
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  Setting up is safe and we are opposing
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  The one world government
[1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  And the mark of the beast they just announced
[1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  Granny Do Right
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Granny Do Right
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  Thanks for holding her on the air
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.000]  Go ahead
[1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  Yeah, and first of all
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  Let me say I love your products
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  I am a granny
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  And we're all the senior citizens out there
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  That may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  I was loaded up with sunspots
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:20.000]  Or age spots as they're lovingly called
[1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:26.000]  My skin is just really gorgeous, actually
[1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  People think I'm 55 years old
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  And I was already taking your other supplements
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  But I thought, you know, well maybe that's what I need to do
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  But when I started taking it
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000]  But, you know, over a period of time
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  I started noticing, okay, you know
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:46.000]  This is the ticket, this is working
[1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  This is wonderful, you know
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:52.000]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know
[1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  So, anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  And it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000]  That's the first thing you do
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.000]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war
[1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  Bad guys start wars
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  They stage an event
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  This is Operation Mathidor
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  Of the New World Order
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  It's Alex Jones
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  Global mega corporations
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:24.000]  The authoritarian, great reset, Klaus Schwab, New World Order
[1:47:24.000 --> 1:47:28.000]  They are making their move
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  Through the Democratic Party
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:32.000]  They see the Tea Party and Trumpism
[1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:34.000]  And all the rest of it is making a move of populism
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  So they've put everything down the Democrats
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  The Democrats aren't hiding that they want to censor
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  Or arrest their political opposition
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  Or track everything we do and just sew it up
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  And so, yes, we're going towards Venezuela
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  Guaranteed that's their admitted goal
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  Bankrupt the country to bring us to our knees
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:52.000]  Now they're in full panic mode
[1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  Because they understand that the right wing in America
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  Is populist, they're energized
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:00.000]  And they know about the New World Order
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And that's why the globalists on the left hate me so much
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  Is because they give me the credit
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  More than anybody of energizing the Tea Party
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  With an anti-New World Order system
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  Which is really what it is
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  So that's why I'm so hated
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  You know, when you read about serial killers
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  They're all over the world
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  They're in Africa, they're in Asia, they're in America
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  They're in Europe, they're in Latin America
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  Like, why do you go and grab a girl, a little girl
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Out of their backyard, go towards her
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  And rape them and kill them?
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Those of us that aren't into that
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  It just seems so horrible and so repulsive
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  But for them, it's a feeling of satisfaction
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  Of being alive and they enjoy it
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  So when you look at Anthony Fauci
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  Or you look at Bill Gates
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  Or you look at any of these people
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  You have to realize that that's their religion
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:24.000]  Is power and control
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  And they get a really sick thrill
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Out of doing that
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  And so I have all these reports
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  I mean, without even looking
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  Every day I see 20, 30, 40 reports
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Of American high school football players
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  Basketball players, track runners
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Sports people having heart attacks
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  And then I've interviewed cardiologists
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  And I've interviewed scientists
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  And I've interviewed virologists
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  And I've interviewed them
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  And they said, well listen
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  The COVID-19 shot, whether it's Moderna, Pfizer, J&J
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  Or AstraZeneca, it all creates a spike protein
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Creates lesions in the heart
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  Particularly in young people
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  And it doesn't kill you
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  Until you get up and do a high aerobic state
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  So all these European governments
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  I covered this in the first hour
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  They're suddenly banning the COVID shots
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  In under 50
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  And again, why are they doing that?
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  Because the public's waking up
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  And because it's overwhelming
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  And because they know
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  But how did the government, how did the CDC
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  In October of 2020
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  Three months before they released a shot
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Say, here's the 27 things we think might happen
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  Microchartitis, heart swelling, heart attacks
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  All of it
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  Blood clots, cancer, infertility
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  Because they'd already really tested it
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  And they knew
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  And they were covering their ass
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  In a private document saying that
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  The Israeli government two days ago
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  Video came out with documents
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  They confirmed it's real
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  Saying, oh yeah, it doesn't help people
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  Almost everybody dying took the shot
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  What are we going to do?
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  How do we cover this up?
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  And somebody in the meeting decided
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  In the Israeli health department
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  In their national department of health
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  To release that because they've got a soul
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  But how did you get Gates and Fauci
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  And all these people
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  As Denmark and Sweden and all these countries
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Banned under 50 taking the shots
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  How do they, how, why do they do it?
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  Because they get off on killing people
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:37.000]  You know, I'm not into bondage
[1:51:37.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  I'm not into paying
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  And a few times I was promiscuous
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:41.000]  Growing up in high school and college
[1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  And I would get this incredible date
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  Incredible woman
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  And they would want me to slap them around
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  And I'd say no and they'd say
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  You're a wimp, screw you, get out of here
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  That happened at least twice
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  I'm like, I'm sorry
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  I don't want to slap you around
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  I don't want to punch you in the face
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  I don't want to beat you with a bullwhip
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  But that's a masochist
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  Or a sadomasochist
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  I guess once the call is paying
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  The point is I'm not into pain, baby
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  I don't want to have pain
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  I'll take it if I got to defend people
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Then I can take it and just turn it off
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  But I don't like it
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  I can turn it off though
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  But imagine wanting to cause pain
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  I want to cause pleasure
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  And God wants to give us pleasure
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  God gave us sex and women and men and everything
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  All this food and sunsets and life
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  And all of it was God gave us this
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  Not the devil
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  So I was thinking today
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:47.000]  I was like, shame on myself this morning
[1:52:47.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  I said I watch all these videos of this track person
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  This basketball star
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  This footballer
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:53.000]  This rugby player
[1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  This soccer player
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  Dying or getting sick
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  And this top cyclist
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  This top swimmer having to quit
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Or this top golfer has to quit
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  Or this...
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  I mean it's everywhere
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  It's after taking shots
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  We have tens of thousands of percent increase
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  In young people having heart attacks
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  Never used to happen
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  It's everywhere
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  Because it fries your heart
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  The next time you speed that sucker up
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  It's bye-bye
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  So this is the tree of death
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  Is what we're talking about here
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  So here's a clip
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  Bartlett Teen
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Suffers heart attack after finishing
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  Cross-country race
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  W.R.E.G.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  Here it is
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  A 17-year-old Bartlett High School
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Cross-country runner is recovering in Florida
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  After undergoing emergency heart surgery
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  Gabe Higginbottom had just completed a race
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  Saturday in Pensacola
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  When he started complaining of chest pains
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  As W.R.E.G.'s Melissa Moon reports
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  He underwent a three-hour surgery
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  And now teammates, coaches and the community
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  Are praying for his swift return to health
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  He ran the race
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  He finished the race
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  He ran well
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  When he was done
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  He was tired
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  But Chris Harmon, boys' coach
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  For Bartlett Cross-country and track
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  Says, aside from the normal exhaustion
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  Something just wasn't right
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  With 17-year-old Gabe Higginbottom
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  After competing Saturday in Pensacola, Florida
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  They started complaining about his chest hurting
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  And kept complaining
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  When we went to the trainer's tent
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  Everybody initially thinks
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  Because it's hot
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  It's heat exhaustion
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  So give him some ice
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  But he's still complaining about his chest
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  Gabe was eventually transported to a heart
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  In vascular hospital in Gainesville
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  Five hours away
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  For what Harmon was told
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  Was a three-hour emergency heart surgery
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Figure out that he had an artery blocked
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  And fixed it
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  Now they're just trying to figure out
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  What is, what caused it
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  Gabe is recovering
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  But news of what happened
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  Came like a bolt out of the blue
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  To teammates and supporters
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  They're cross-country runners
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  So these guys are just slim
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  And trim their fit
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  And so to see that there was something there
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  Yeah, it kind of shocked everybody
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  Joe Moore's 16-year-old son Andrew
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Is on the team with Gabe
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And Moore says what happened
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  Will make him take a closer look
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  At his son's condition
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  After he crosses the finish line
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  But now it's, it may be a little bit more
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  Of looking, watching them
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  Just a little bit closer
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  Seeing if there's anything, just little
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Anything that's not normal
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  Moore and other supporters
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  Immediately took steps to help Gabe
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  And his family through this crisis
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  A few of us got together
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And decided to do a GoFundMe page
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  And so we started that up
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  And it's, it's just blossom from there
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  Melissa Moon, WREG, News Channel 3
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  And we reached Gabe's mother this morning
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  But she said her son was about to undergo
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  More tests and she didn't have time to talk
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  They're doing this heart ablation
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  Where they burn away parts of the heart
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  On thousands of young people a week
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  As young as five years old
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  They're taking the shot
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  But notice the adults all have
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  Stockholm syndrome
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  We're just looking for something weird
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  We don't know what caused this
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  Well, we know what caused it
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  You bet your bottom dollar
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  He took the Pfizer, Moderna, J&J, shot
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  And so if you got stung by a particular B
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  Or a particular bug
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And then you got sick
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  You'd know the bug did it
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  I don't need to be an ornithologist
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  To know what a bird is
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  I don't need to be an expert in insects
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  No one in insects is
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  I don't need to know why the black widow bites me
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  I can have a big rod hole in my body
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  That can kill me
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  The rattlesnake bites me
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  I know my legs swallow
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  Because the rattlesnake bite
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  It's the shots
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  But there's thousands of these videos
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Gee, we just don't know why
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  In some schools two of our football players
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  Had heart attacks
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  It's never happened in 60 years of this high school
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  But we just don't know
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  Gee, whatever
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  When I come back
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  I'm gonna talk about the tree of death
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  And really what this is all about
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  On the other side
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  It's very illustrative
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  I'll leave it at that
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  And if you understand this
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  You understand everything
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Because this is all a test
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  To see what they can do to us
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  They want to kill us
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  But if they come with armies and troops
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  And machine guns will rally
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  They'll stand up, we'll beat them
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  But none of it comes
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  Via the medical system
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  And that's what it is
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  It's all confirmed
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  So they're doing this
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  And all these parents
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  Are such nice people
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  And so simple
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  And so friendly
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  They can't imagine the system
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  Trying to kill them
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  That's what happens
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  The most victims of crime
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  They can't believe what's happening to them
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  But it is happening to you
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  We'll be right back
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  We'll be right back

[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  Is insane

[1:59:21.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  And it's not been pasteurized
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  It's not been boiled

[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:15.000]  See what happens with your dreams
[2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  Dr. Pauli Alexander
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  Who warns about Operation Warp Speed
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  Joining us coming up
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Next segment in studio
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  And they're now admitting the CDC lie
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  They're now admitting the shots kill you
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  And MAMU and a racial immune system
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  So much to cover
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  As we try to stop
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:31.000]  The next lockdown
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:33.000]  The next forced injection program
[2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  They admit their planning
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  I don't want to hit this now
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:39.000]  The tree of death is what we're calling this
[2:00:39.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  And I saw this graphic
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  This political cartoon
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  From infowarstore.com this morning
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:47.000]  Here it is from Twitter
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:49.000]  For radio listeners I'll describe it
[2:00:49.000 --> 2:00:51.000]  It shows a tree
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.000]  And above the surface
[2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  The branches is inflation
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  High taxes
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  Open borders
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:01.000]  Globalism
[2:01:01.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Recession
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  Racial division
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  Defund the police
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  Violence
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  Human trafficking
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:15.000]  Criminal deaths
[2:01:15.000 --> 2:01:17.000]  It goes on and on
[2:01:17.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  But the problem with the graphic
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  By Brandco a great political cartoonist
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  Is it's got Joe Biden as the root
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:37.000]  And the donkey and Obama
[2:01:37.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  And a sippy cup
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  The root crosses are really the globalists
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  Like Klaus Schwab
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  And his corporate controllers
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  Like Bill Gates
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  And the king of England who is involved
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  In all this eugenics and depopulation
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:01.000]  King Charles III
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  But really at the end of the day
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  It's the devil
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Is it the root?
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:11.000]  The root cause, ladies and gentlemen
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  Is not King Charles
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  Not Bill Gates
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  Not Klaus Schwab
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  Not the donkey
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  But it's evil
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  You can call it what you want
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:27.000]  You can say what it is
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  You can play games all day
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  But this is a fight
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:35.000]  Between good versus evil
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  And everything the new older does
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  Is destructive to their own interest
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  They go out of their way to kill, steal and destroy
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:43.000]  Because they like it
[2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:45.000]  Because they hate God's creation
[2:02:45.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  They hate human destiny
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:49.000]  They are fundamentally, spiritually jealous
[2:02:49.000 --> 2:02:51.000]  Of the tree of life
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  And they want the tree of death
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  We're going to go to break
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  Come back with our special guest in studio
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:01.000]  After a special report
[2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  I don't like having to come to you
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:05.000]  And ask for your support, it's quite frankly
[2:03:05.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  I have a lot of news to cover
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:09.000]  And I don't want to sit there and try to squeeze you
[2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  But we're the tip of the spear
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.000]  And the enemy's fighting around the clock to stop us
[2:03:13.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  If you want to be a part of history
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:15.000]  If you really want to know
[2:03:15.000 --> 2:03:17.000]  You contributed a critical time
[2:03:17.000 --> 2:03:19.000]  And have a great piece of history
[2:03:19.000 --> 2:03:23.000]  I would go to 1776coin.com
[2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:27.000]  1776coin.com
[2:03:27.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  The Teddy Roosevelt
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.000]  Man the arena coin
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:33.000]  The Teddy Roosevelt in the front
[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  The gladiator on the back
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  There's a few limited coins that are left as well
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  For the last run at 1776coin.com
[2:03:43.000 --> 2:03:45.000]  And again, it's just like an NPR deal
[2:03:45.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  Or PBS where there's a markup on it
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.000]  As a fundraiser
[2:03:47.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  You're keeping us on air
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  By getting this silver coin
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  I want to encourage you all to go to 1776coin
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  That's 1-776-1776coin.com
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  And get the Teddy Roosevelt
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:01.000]  Man the arena coin
[2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  There's only 10,000 existence
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  Already 3,000 have sold
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  We need to sell this to battle the globalists
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  And fight these show trials
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  And file appeals
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:13.000]  And stay on air
[2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  Without your support
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:15.000]  We won't be on air with your support
[2:04:15.000 --> 2:04:17.000]  We will continue on steadfastly
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  Whatever the cost may be
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:19.000]  Never giving up
[2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  I'll never give up
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  I'll never give in
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  But I could give out
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  So I fired the bat signal
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  To all of you that have been on the fence
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  Or never got the product
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  You should go to 1776coin.com
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  1-776coin.com
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:31.000]  Got the Teddy Roosevelt
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  Man the arena coin
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  All the coins are amazing
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.000]  But this is the fourth coin
[2:04:35.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  And probably the last coin for a while
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  We're going to have something else
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  Come out very, very soon
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:41.000]  But 1776coin.com
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  I want to thank you all
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:43.000]  For your support
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Also going to sign copy
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  Of the number one book in the world right now
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:47.000]  The Great Reset in the War of the World
[2:04:47.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  Signed by yours truly
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:49.000]  Exclusively
[2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  You're going to sign copy
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:51.000]  Then go to 1776coin.com
[2:04:51.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  You know who you are
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:53.000]  That have been supporting
[2:04:53.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  I want to thank you all
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:55.000]  Those on the fence
[2:04:55.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  Get off the fence
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:04:59.000]  People ask me all the time
[2:04:59.000 --> 2:05:01.000]  What is your best new tropic
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  You've got turbo force
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  You've got brain force plus
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  And you've got brain force ultra
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  Which one is better
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  And that's like asking
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:11.000]  What's better
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:13.000]  A Ford F-150
[2:05:13.000 --> 2:05:15.000]  Or a Cadillac
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:17.000]  Or a Ferrari
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  It's different strokes
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:19.000]  For different folks
[2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  It varies
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  All three are different formulas
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  All three do different things
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:27.000]  Turbo force is 10 hours of clean
[2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.000]  Out of control energy
[2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:33.000]  Brain force plus is a
[2:05:33.000 --> 2:05:35.000]  Long term acting clean
[2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Neutrophic
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:37.000]  This brain force ultra
[2:05:37.000 --> 2:05:39.000]  Is a super fast acting
[2:05:39.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  Neutropic
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:43.000]  That creates incredible clarity
[2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  But doesn't last very long
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  They're all three different formulas
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:47.000]  And finally
[2:05:47.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  Back in stock
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:49.000]  Massively discounted
[2:05:49.000 --> 2:05:51.000]  Brain force ultra is available
[2:05:51.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  At infowarstore.com

[2:05:55.000 --> 2:05:57.000]  Infowarstore.com
[2:06:25.000 --> 2:06:27.000]  Humanity is waking up to them
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  All over the planet
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  There are populist parties
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:31.000]  Nationalist parties
[2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:33.000]  Anti-world economic forum
[2:06:33.000 --> 2:06:35.000]  Parties
[2:06:35.000 --> 2:06:37.000]  Coming to power
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.000]  The new conservative leader in Canada
[2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  Is completely anti-new world order
[2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:43.000]  And just won the leadership of his party
[2:06:43.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  They held elections today
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  Justin Trudeau would be removed
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  As the leader of Canada
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:51.000]  Go Trudeau, you're nothing but a
[2:06:51.000 --> 2:06:53.000]  Communist pig
[2:06:53.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  But why is it so important
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.000]  That we're on the air
[2:06:57.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  Why is it so important
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  Your backing of the few OACs
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  Of truth and freedom
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:05.000]  Because as things get worse and worse
[2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  As the new world order comes out in the open
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  People are hungering for the truth more than ever
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:11.000]  And the globalists know
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  If we stay on air
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:13.000]  And others stay on air
[2:07:13.000 --> 2:07:15.000]  We will dominate the culture war
[2:07:15.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  We will win
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:17.000]  They will go to prison
[2:07:17.000 --> 2:07:19.000]  They will be defeated
[2:07:19.000 --> 2:07:23.000]  You will pay for the massacring of
[2:07:23.000 --> 2:07:25.000]  Communist humanity
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:27.000]  Your vote too is happening
[2:07:27.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  Open spirit.com
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  We have all the research
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  That's why it is critical
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  Beyond critical, essential
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  That you continue in the face of censorship
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:37.000]  And everything is going on
[2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:39.000]  By word of mouth, by text message
[2:07:39.000 --> 2:07:41.000]  By email, by the side of your barn
[2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  The back of your car
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:43.000]  Calling you to talk radio
[2:07:43.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  Calling you to see-span
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  Frankly, what I'm focused on today
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  Is building the united front against what-
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  And this is not hyper-belief
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  What to me is US fascism
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:55.000]  That's your chat with a few callers
[2:07:55.000 --> 2:07:57.000]  John's up first out of Austin, Texas
[2:07:57.000 --> 2:07:59.000]  Independent, good morning
[2:07:59.000 --> 2:08:01.000]  Good morning, yeah, I-
[2:08:01.000 --> 2:08:03.000]  I'm listening to Mr. Mitchell here
[2:08:03.000 --> 2:08:05.000]  And just as an American
[2:08:05.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  And I'm wondering how it is that
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:09.000]  Trump is a cult
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:11.000]  And the Democratic Party is an occult
[2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  When they've already instituted socialism
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  They've flirted with communism
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:19.000]  And you talk about fascism
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  We can talk a lot about the Democratic Party
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  And their neo-fascist views
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  So why is it that
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  You want to bring the country together
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  Yet you want to take this extreme side?
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  The Republican Party has been captured
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  By a political cult
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:39.000]  I don't use those words lightly
[2:08:39.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  Aligning to cult things
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  We can go back to Obama administration
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  But I would also go more recent history
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  You've got the Black Lives Matter
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  The Antifa siding with Democrats
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:49.000]  As cities were burned down
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:51.000]  People were murdered
[2:08:51.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  It seems very cult-like
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  We've got the Biden administration
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:55.000]  With pharmaceutical companies
[2:08:55.000 --> 2:08:57.000]  Spending billions of dollars, right?
[2:08:57.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  On vaccines that went from 100% efficacy
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  To 40% efficacy
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  And they're making billions of dollars
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  We've had free speech taken away
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:07.000]  Plymouth, Michigan
[2:09:07.000 --> 2:09:09.000]  This is Janice, line for Republicans
[2:09:09.000 --> 2:09:11.000]  Good morning
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  Good morning
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:15.000]  Mr. Mitchell
[2:09:15.000 --> 2:09:17.000]  There are none so blind
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:19.000]  As those who cannot see
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:21.000]  Let me give you a little piece of advice
[2:09:21.000 --> 2:09:23.000]  You will never succeed
[2:09:23.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  In your goal
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  By insulting half the country
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:29.000]  And calling them fascists
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:31.000]  Racists
[2:09:31.000 --> 2:09:33.000]  Ultramagas
[2:09:33.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  So that's political violence
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:37.000]  That you're talking about
[2:09:37.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  That Republicans and Ultramagas
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:41.000]  Are doing
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  It doesn't exist
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:43.000]  It's a lie
[2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  It is a lie
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  There was political violence
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  In our country
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:49.000]  In the summer of 2020
[2:09:49.000 --> 2:09:51.000]  Wherever you can be heard
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  Know whether it's by five people
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  Or a thousand
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:55.000]  Or a hundred thousand
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  Or a million
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:57.000]  You're gonna win the fight
[2:09:57.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  Meanwhile
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:09:59.000]  Democrat Senator
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:01.000]  Compares 9-11 terrorists
[2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.000]  To January 6 rioters
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  The stunning thing to me is
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:05.000]  Here we are
[2:10:05.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  20 years later
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  And
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  The attack on the symbol of our democracy
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Was not coming from terrorists
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:11.000]  But it came from
[2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  Literally insurgents
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:15.000]  Attacking the Capitol on January 6
[2:10:15.000 --> 2:10:17.000]  Some of those answers will come from Republicans
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  It's not the extremists
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.000]  That we're dealing with every single day
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  We've got to kill and confront that movement
[2:10:23.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  What is a semi-fascist?
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  Most people in America know
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  That it is not helpful to our country
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  When we have people who are denying elections
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  Or trying to obstruct
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  The outcome of an election
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  We are seeing an emerging threat
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  Of course, over the last several years
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  Of the domestic violent extremist
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  The individual here in the United States
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  Radicalized the violence
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  By a foreign terrorist ideology
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:49.000]  But also an ideology of hate
[2:10:49.000 --> 2:10:51.000]  Anti-government sentiment
[2:10:51.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  False narratives propagated
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:55.000]  On online platforms
[2:10:55.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  Even personal grievances
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:10:59.000]  But then they're gonna start, though, with Alex Jones
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.000]  Oh, we're just gonna censor Alex Jones
[2:11:01.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  And then Donald Trump
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:03.000]  And then well, everybody
[2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:05.000]  And well, now it's a social credit score
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:07.000]  To the banks that tracks what you buy
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  And what you do
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:09.000]  This is all being rolled out worldwide
[2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  It's here now
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  I don't want to call him a whistleblower
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  He's a witness to what happened
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  In Health and Human Services
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  Working with Redfield, Berks, Fauci
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  All of them, Dr. Paul E.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  Alexander, Ph.D.
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  Dr. Paul Alexander.com
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  He is an expertise in epidemiology
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  Clinical epidemiology
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  And he witnessed it all
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  And watched them block the therapeutics
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  Watched them push warp speed
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  He was the fly on the wall
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  So introduce yourself
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  Because if I tried it, it would take an hour
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  You got quite the pedigree
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  And then let's get into what you want to impart
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:45.000]  To this audience today
[2:11:45.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  And thanks for being here
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:47.000]  Thank you very much, Alex
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  What an honor and a pleasure
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:51.000]  So look, the bottom line is
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  My background training is in
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  Evidence-based medicine
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  Clinical epidemiology
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:57.000]  Out of the University of Toronto
[2:11:57.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  Oxford in England
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Math, Mastering in Canada, et cetera
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.000]  I worked for the World Health Organization
[2:12:03.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  2019
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  And then the World Health Organization
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.000]  Asked me to be a pandemic advisor
[2:12:09.000 --> 2:12:11.000]  In evidence-based medicine, et cetera
[2:12:11.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  Which is my function
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  Around May of 2020
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  A person in the Trump administration
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  Asked me to go to Washington
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  To join the administration
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  To work at Health and Human Services
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  To provide support to the president
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  And what they were doing in terms of the response
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  And I guess, again, I'm so
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:33.000]  Honored to be here
[2:12:33.000 --> 2:12:35.000]  The message that I want to give today
[2:12:35.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  To the American people is this
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  I've listened to Alex many times
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  And I've listened to other people
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  I mean, I'm an academic scientist
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  And I can say I work with people like
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  Dr. Peter McCullough
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  Dr. Harvey Wiesch
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:47.000]  Dr. Howard Tannenbaum
[2:12:47.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  These people
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  Dr. Richard Osso, et cetera
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:53.000]  We looked at all of the science
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  From the beginning of this pandemic
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  January, February in America
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:12:59.000]  2020 to today
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  There is no science anywhere in the world
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  None where any lockdown worked
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  To curb transmission or death
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  No science shows, no data
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  That any school closure
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  Any mask mandate
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  Any business closure
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  I want to say it as clearly as I can
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  The data is clear
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:21.000]  Every single COVID policy failed
[2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  Every lockdown policy failed
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  That Fauci, Francis Collins
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  Berks implemented
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:29.000]  And it was devastating
[2:13:29.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  Many, many people in America
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:33.000]  Particularly our children committed suicide
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:35.000]  And you've been saying that for a long time
[2:13:35.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  And now you're vindicated
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  And you're being attacked by the Southern
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:39.000]  Probably Lost Center
[2:13:39.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  Everybody, we put the headline up there
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  Former Trump official
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  Those quote anti-vax
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  But I've read your writings
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:45.000]  You're not anti-vax
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  No
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.000]  You're anti-experimental vax
[2:13:47.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  So you've been vindicated
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  Since they attacked you over a year ago
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  The CDC admits they lied
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:53.000]  They covered up the data
[2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  You've been vindicated
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  Yes, sir, and that's the key
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000]  A lot of us have been vindicated
[2:13:57.000 --> 2:13:59.000]  By the Chariot, Kuldorf, Gupta
[2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  Scott Atlas, myself
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  We fought for a focused protection
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:05.000]  Because we saw out of the gate
[2:14:05.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  February, March, April, 2020
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  That COVID was amenable to risk stratification
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:14.000]  And that meant that with age-risk stratified approach
[2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  You strongly properly protect
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:18.000]  The vulnerability of society
[2:14:18.000 --> 2:14:21.000]  You use early treatments as needed
[2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  But you leave the rest of society
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  99.9% alone
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.000]  Let them live a normal life
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  And deal with their normal lives
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  Deal with the pathogen
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  They would have developed natural immunity
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:36.000]  And we'd have gotten to herd immunity very early on
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  And you said that a long time ago
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  And we're targeted
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:39.000]  Now, multiple European governments
[2:14:39.000 --> 2:14:41.000]  Are banning under 50 taking a shot
[2:14:41.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  Yes, that is so
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  That's a big deal
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  Yeah, because they understand
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:47.000]  The devastation of the shot
[2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:50.000]  Look, the mRNA gene delivery
[2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:53.000]  I call it a gene delivery platform
[2:14:53.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  Some people say it's a vaccine
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  Some say inoculation
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:57.000]  It has failed
[2:14:57.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  The public needs to understand
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  That it has failed on Delta
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:04.000]  It failed completely on Omicron
[2:15:04.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  With waning efficacy
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  Immediately with negative efficacy
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:10.000]  And it is very harmful
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  We know of the paracarditis, myocarditis
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:15.000]  Blood clotting, bleeding, et cetera
[2:15:15.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  My message, Alex asked me
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  And I'll say it as bluntly as I can
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  Your child as a parent
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  Has a statistical zero risk to the table
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  There is no science today
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  No one has prosecuted the case
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  As to why any healthy child
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:30.000]  We know of the data
[2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  No healthy child
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:33.000]  Not one
[2:15:33.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  I challenge anyone openly on this program
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:39.000]  Fauci, Walinsky, Francis Collins, anyone
[2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  No healthy child in America
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:43.000]  Has gotten COVID and has died
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  That is the data
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  And what they're doing right now
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:49.000]  The CDC and the FDA is a fraud
[2:15:49.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  And they are coming after children
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  Who have a zero risk with a vaccine
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:54.000]  That is ineffective
[2:15:54.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  Stay there, Dr. Alexander
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  It's the fourth coin that we've released the last year
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  This is something you want to own
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:34.000]  The information war against the globalist
[2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:36.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  They'll sell out very quickly
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:39.000]  Please be part of history
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  And thank you all for your support
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  You can go to 1776coin.com
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  Or you can go to patreoncollectibles.com
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  And secure this coin
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:51.000]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence
[2:16:51.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  And it funds the info war
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:16:57.000]  1776coin.com
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  Were very public about their plans
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:03.000]  They financed major universities
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  They ran full page stories
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  And advertisements pushing their propaganda
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  Of New York Times, other major newspapers
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:13.000]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing
[2:17:13.000 --> 2:17:15.000]  And must be ended
[2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:16.000]  And the first step in that
[2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  Is getting women out of the household
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  And teaching women that cooking dinner
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  And taking care of their sons and daughters
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  And husbands is a bad thing
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  Making dinner for my daughter
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  My four and a half year old daughter
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  And my wife makes dinner a lot of times
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  But I like to make it as well
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  I love to make breakfast
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  To make food for your family
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:38.000]  And be nurturative
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  And then all sit down together
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:42.000]  And have the communal event
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.000]  And that's what the system is attacking
[2:17:44.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  And bombarding is our normal
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:48.000]  Biological actions are coming together
[2:17:48.000 --> 2:17:51.000]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult
[2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.000]  Of filth that want to domesticate us
[2:17:53.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  And turn us into lab rats
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  We cannot let this continue
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  The Great Reset in the War for the World
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:33.000]  Is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  We are now number nine in the world
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:38.000]  Woo!
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:39.000]  This is major
[2:18:39.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  This is political
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.000]  This could fund our war chest
[2:18:42.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  Just go to Amazon.com
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:45.000]  Everybody, and buy ten copies
[2:18:45.000 --> 2:18:48.000]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star
[2:18:48.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And the New World Order
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:50.000]  Because you read this
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:51.000]  You know their whole plan, how to stop them
[2:18:51.000 --> 2:18:53.000]  Get the Great Reset in the War for the World now
[2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  It's gonna go to number one
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:56.000]  What do you make of that?
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:02.000]  Sold out for more than a year and a half
[2:19:02.000 --> 2:19:04.000]  Because of supply chain breakdowns
[2:19:04.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  Our best selling product, Super Blue
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  Is finally back in stock
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  The original available at infowarstore.com

[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  And already half of our stock has sold out

[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  Being sold out for more than a year and a half
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  Finally back available at infowarstore.com
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  Of the New World Order
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:05.000]  It's Alex Jones
[2:20:14.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  He doesn't want credit
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  But if we don't give credit to the champions of truth
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:22.000]  We are going to be lost
[2:20:22.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  Dr. Paul E. Alexander
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  Two and a half years ago
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Working at the wine house with President Trump
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:30.000]  With Health and Human Services
[2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:32.000]  Began to warn the world of their blocking therapeutics
[2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  Began to warn about the shots
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:36.000]  And he's been heavily demonized
[2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:39.000]  And listed as the top 11 disinformation operatives
[2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  By the Southern Primary Law Center and others
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:42.000]  So they're trying to destroy
[2:20:42.000 --> 2:20:43.000]  But two and a half years later
[2:20:43.000 --> 2:20:45.000]  Totally vindicated
[2:20:45.000 --> 2:20:47.000]  It was the real scientist
[2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:48.000]  And the real researchers
[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:51.000]  And the real healthcare workers and doctors
[2:20:51.000 --> 2:20:53.000]  That put the brakes on this thing worldwide
[2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:54.000]  And so round of applause
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  I know you don't want that
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:57.000]  You're trying to stop the next big push
[2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  Here Dr. Alexander
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:00.000]  But just today
[2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:02.000]  They released Canadian government documents
[2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:04.000]  Where they knew Ivermectin did a great job
[2:21:04.000 --> 2:21:06.000]  The British Medical Journal comes out
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:08.000]  And says 93% of deaths are the triple facts
[2:21:08.000 --> 2:21:11.000]  I mean, it's not about saying we told you so
[2:21:11.000 --> 2:21:16.000]  But my Lord censored, attacked, demonized, targeted
[2:21:16.000 --> 2:21:18.000]  Self-U and countless other patriots
[2:21:18.000 --> 2:21:19.000]  And now we're vindicated
[2:21:19.000 --> 2:21:21.000]  And they hope this thing just blows over
[2:21:21.000 --> 2:21:24.000]  Speak to when you first woke up
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:25.000]  And started speaking out
[2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.000]  And then what do you make of
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:29.000]  The head of the CDC and others
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  Going, okay, we lied to you
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:31.000]  But it's no big deal
[2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.000]  Yeah, we covered up the advocacy
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:34.000]  I mean, this is so big
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:36.000]  Well, I mean, look
[2:21:36.000 --> 2:21:38.000]  The fact of the matter is the CDC
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:40.000]  And the NIH and they today
[2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  Running back was including Fauci
[2:21:42.000 --> 2:21:45.000]  To try to see when Walensky said
[2:21:45.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  You know, we have made some dramatic mistakes
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:49.000]  And errors and we are trying to correct
[2:21:49.000 --> 2:21:51.000]  And there's going to be a reorganization
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  We covered up the safety
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  That's a quote
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:54.000]  And that is the key
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:57.000]  The key here is we can't let these people off the hook
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:00.000]  The reason being is that for over two years
[2:22:00.000 --> 2:22:02.000]  We have provided data
[2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:05.000]  We've provided science to these people directly
[2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:07.000]  Not just in the news and writing and publishing
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:09.000]  Some of us have communicated with them direct
[2:22:09.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  The fact of the matter is the CDC and the NIH
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:15.000]  Et cetera, they are not, they won't follow in the science
[2:22:15.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  They were averse to the science
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  And working against the science
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:19.000]  And working against us
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:21.000]  And they would send the attack dogs
[2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  Including the media out to punish us
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  To slander and smear us and cancel us
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.000]  And a lot of us have been hurt
[2:22:27.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  We've been hurt devastatingly, particularly financially
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  But we made the decision, particularly when we came out
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  That this battle, this is the hill
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:39.000]  That we are prepared to lay our best battle down on
[2:22:39.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  Because parents, particularly
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  The public needs to understand
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:45.000]  We saw the data on the lockdowns
[2:22:45.000 --> 2:22:47.000]  We saw the harms, we saw the children
[2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:49.000]  Who were committed suicide
[2:22:49.000 --> 2:22:51.000]  Look, we had reports coming up into the White House
[2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:54.000]  With parents taking their young children
[2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  Into the emergency room
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:58.000]  Unresponsive in their arms telling the doctors
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:00.000]  During the lockdowns on school closures
[2:23:00.000 --> 2:23:03.000]  Doc, we think we might have killed the child
[2:23:03.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  Because we have been physically abusing each other
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  And today we beat the child
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:09.000]  The lockdowns on school closures
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:12.000]  Record suicide, record family violence, record hell
[2:23:12.000 --> 2:23:14.000]  Yes, devastated America
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:17.000]  And we have to, we need proper public inquiries
[2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  Proper, this is United States of America
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:24.000]  Legal inquiries of Fauci, Wolinsky, Francis Collins
[2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  Books, Francis Albert Bula
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  And by the way, suddenly
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:31.000]  That the CNNs had analysts
[2:23:31.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  Suddenly all their people are coming out
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  Saying, oh, we shouldn't do masks, we're wrong
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:38.000]  Because they know they've been caught
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:40.000]  Of course they've been caught
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.000]  We had publications over a year, two years now
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.000]  Showing that those blue surgical masks
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:47.000]  Those white cloth masks were highly ineffective
[2:23:47.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  CDC had a study in 2020
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  That showed that the masks didn't work
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  For respiratory flu-like illnesses
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  Oxford group also did a study
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:58.000]  In around July 2020, same thing
[2:23:58.000 --> 2:24:01.000]  We knew that the masks were entirely ineffective
[2:24:01.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  And even harmful
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  Those masks are very toxic to young children
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  Should not be used in young children
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  But those don't know, explain it, the carbon dioxide alone
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  Oh, yeah, well, I mean, there's a deprivation of oxygen
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  And there's carbon dioxide buildup
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  Not only that, the masks, the little fibers and stuff
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  They get this large and get down deep inside of the lungs
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  And could cause serious pathology
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  So when we looked at all of the data
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  We published in Brownstone Institute
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  We looked at all of the data, over 150 pieces of evidence
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:30.000]  That showed that the...
[2:24:30.000 --> 2:24:32.000]  You were a pioneer writing papers, warning people
[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  Oh, yeah, I wrote a lot for Brownstone
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  Jeff Tucker's group and...
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:39.000]  One of my papers on natural immunity
[2:24:39.000 --> 2:24:41.000]  Is actually used by people even in the Congress
[2:24:41.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  And in Senate informally
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:46.000]  They use it as part of legal cases
[2:24:46.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  Lawyers all over the world write me
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  I put together all of the studies to show
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:53.000]  That natural immunity from day one
[2:24:53.000 --> 2:24:55.000]  Fauci et al. Wolinsky knew
[2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  That natural immunity was long-term, bulletproof
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Almost lifelong, much more superior than vaccine
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:04.000]  But have you said that he was a medical doctor that sent for you?
[2:25:04.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  They would destroy you
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:08.000]  They would take your income, take your license
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:11.000]  They came after me, ravaged myself
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  Yet we showed them a study that showed that people
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.000]  Who were alive almost 100 years after the Spanish flu
[2:25:18.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  When we looked at their blood, we found
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  Immunological response to the Spanish flu
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:28.000]  Nearly 100 years post-exposure
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  It showed us that natural immunity was bulletproof and lifelong
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:33.000]  Let me ask you this
[2:25:33.000 --> 2:25:35.000]  You're one of the main troublers
[2:25:35.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  What would it have been like if thousands of prominent
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  Scientists and doctors and insiders like yourself
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  Hadn't gone public?
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:44.000]  They said they wanted the lockdown to be forever
[2:25:44.000 --> 2:25:46.000]  Of course, and I think it's about a court
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  12, 15 of us who talk to people like Alex
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  We go on his show, we speak
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  Had it not been for us
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:56.000]  They would have run roughshod over the entire
[2:25:56.000 --> 2:25:58.000]  United States and the world
[2:25:58.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  We have been the rate-limiting step
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  And we begged, we begged doctors
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.000]  Particularly clinical doctors to step up
[2:26:06.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  Many have come to us and said, look
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  You people are stronger than us
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  We can't take the chance because we will be destroyed
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:15.000]  Our practices will be closed
[2:26:15.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  We can't take the chance
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  But instead the children get destroyed because of their cowardice
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  Well, this is the thing, you use the word
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  I would use the word cowardice too
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:25.000]  I think doctors at the end of this should hang their heads in shame
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  Across Canada, UK, Australia, the United States
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  They did not stand up and push back against the governments
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  Particularly on the issue of natural immunity
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  Particularly on the issue of the use of early treatment
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  They should have used it and on pushing these vaccines
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  And what's crazy is, I'm not a scientist like you
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:45.000]  But everybody knows that natural immunity
[2:26:45.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  Is 99% effective on average for decades and decades
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  As you said, almost 100 years from studies
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:53.000]  Fauci was in the videos saying decades ago
[2:26:53.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  The best thing is natural immunity
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:26:58.000]  But then later they said, you saw the surgeon general last year
[2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:01.000]  Said, oh, natural immunity is not even good
[2:27:01.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  Well, I mean, look, how else do you want me to say it?
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  Fauci misled, he was duplicitous
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  I would actually say instead, Anthony Fauci lied
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:12.000]  Every time he stated that natural immunity was inferior
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:14.000]  And we did not have the studies to prove
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  That was a blatant deception
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  He knew better than that
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.000]  He knew that natural immunity was superior
[2:27:21.000 --> 2:27:25.000]  Not just the second line acquired adaptive immunity
[2:27:25.000 --> 2:27:28.000]  We are talking also about the natural innate immunity
[2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  Which is the first line of defense that children bring to the table
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:35.000]  And he knew that children are a very, very potent player
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:37.000]  In the immunological landscape
[2:27:37.000 --> 2:27:40.000]  And that if you vaccinate children with these vaccines
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:43.000]  We run the risk of subverting that innate response
[2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:45.000]  That could devastate the response
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  Look, you don't like to speculate
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:49.000]  We'll come back for a break and talk about it
[2:27:49.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  Obviously, I saw Pfizer videos three years ago
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:52.000]  Where they set a shot like this
[2:27:52.000 --> 2:27:54.000]  Where they released it with a race immunity
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Now we know it's a race immunity
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  Aren't they trying to create bubble children or boy in the bubble
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:00.000]  Who don't have immune systems?
[2:28:00.000 --> 2:28:02.000]  Of course, because right now we have the study, Alex
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  The studies that show us that the vaccine
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:07.000]  These COVID, particularly the mRNA platform
[2:28:07.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  Is subverting the immune system
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  And causing serious, serious problems
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  And damaging the immune response
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:16.000]  So we are going to, right now
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  We are seeing children presenting with hepatitis
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  Issues around polio, et cetera
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.000]  Diseases and illnesses they did not have before
[2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  By locking down our children and masking them
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:30.000]  Every restrictive step that we took
[2:28:30.000 --> 2:28:33.000]  We weakened and dampened the immune system
[2:28:33.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  That needs to be taxed and tuned up
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:37.000]  Again, you don't hear much about it
[2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:40.000]  But I work a lot with Goodfand and Bosch on this
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.000]  The innate immune system of a child
[2:28:43.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  After maternal antibodies were in four to six months or so
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  Must be exposed to pathogen
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  You cannot lock a child down or mask them
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:53.000]  And prevent...
[2:28:53.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  Stay there, Donna
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:55.000]  This is critical
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Let's go back with us
[2:29:25.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  10 hours of clean, out of control energy
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  Brainforce Plus is a long-term acting clean
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:35.000]  Neutropid
[2:29:35.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  This Brainforce Ultra is a super fast acting
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  Neutropic that creates incredible clarity
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  But doesn't last very long
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  They're all three different formulas
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:47.000]  And finally, back at stock
[2:29:47.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  Massively discounted
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:50.000]  Brainforce Ultra is available
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.000]  At infowarstore.com
[2:29:53.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria
[2:29:56.000 --> 2:29:57.000]  Or a pump gas
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  Or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:01.000]  Or a millionaire
[2:30:01.000 --> 2:30:04.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles
[2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  You see it every year
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:08.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers
[2:30:08.000 --> 2:30:11.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers
[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:14.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over
[2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:16.000]  Especially the big firms and the big tax groups
[2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:18.000]  Because they're part of the system
[2:30:18.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  And they don't want the general public
[2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  Understanding this and knowing this show
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:25.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation
[2:30:25.000 --> 2:30:28.000]  And all the things out there hurting everybody
[2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  To be able to do things tax-wise
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:32.000]  It's legal and lawful
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  That allows you to keep more of your money
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:35.000]  We wouldn't even be here
[2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  If I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  The only way you fail is not
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:42.000]  Riding down the URL
[2:30:42.000 --> 2:30:44.000]  jonestaxrelief.com
[2:30:44.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  Recall 833-904-285

[2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.000]  Be it over the internet or in person
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  It changes the world
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:11.000]  They know you're angry
[2:32:11.000 --> 2:32:13.000]  And now to get around big tech
[2:32:13.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  It's more important than ever
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:17.000]  That we use every tool we've got
[2:32:17.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen

[2:33:40.000 --> 2:33:41.000]  You said it
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:44.000]  All right, Dr. Paul E. Alexander
[2:33:44.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  Is in the studio with us
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  He was finishing up a point
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:47.000]  He went to break it
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  He wanted to say something about Trump
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:49.000]  But he's talked to and warned
[2:33:49.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  About warp speed and just comments
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  About where we're at now
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  With this whole situation
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:55.000]  So I've been asking a lot of questions, sir
[2:33:55.000 --> 2:33:57.000]  And I just want to say this again
[2:33:57.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  Because I can't overstate this
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  We got censored, we got demonized
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  You got censored, we all got attacked
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  We've been vindicated
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:09.000]  The CDC is trying to reverse the guidance
[2:34:09.000 --> 2:34:10.000]  On everything
[2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  They are now saying they lied to us
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:12.000]  I mean, this is a big deal
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  But Dr. Alexander
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  You want to talk about Trump here
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:16.000]  You've got the floor, I'm going to shut up
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  Well, look, let me get to the point
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.000]  I had the pleasure of working at
[2:34:20.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  Health and Human Services
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  And I reported directly and indirectly
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  To the White House
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  And I think that I would say it this way
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:32.000]  I think President Trump, in my view
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  Would go down as probably one of the
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:36.000]  Greatest Presidents the United States
[2:34:36.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  Has ever had
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:40.000]  I think that he was badly misled
[2:34:40.000 --> 2:34:43.000]  By Fauci books, that whole cabal
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  They devastated his presidency
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  And Alex had said something
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  That I had written about before
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  And I want to say it as clearly as possible
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  I don't fault President Trump
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  I think he's the best thing on deck today
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:00.000]  He must stand up though
[2:35:00.000 --> 2:35:02.000]  He has to stand up today
[2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:05.000]  And state clearly that those lockdowns
[2:35:05.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  Hurt, they were the wrong move
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:10.000]  He took bad guidance from Fauci on books
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  And he must stand up against these
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  Co-Virginian injections
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  These injections have failed
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  In his capacity, it will go a long way
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:19.000]  In helping us
[2:35:19.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  We are out there battling the vaccine makers
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:24.000]  With this vaccine and their causing harms
[2:35:24.000 --> 2:35:28.000]  We need his voice, particularly to protect our children
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:30.000]  Please continue
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  No, what I mean, how else can I say it
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:36.000]  I think from my point of view
[2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  From what I have seen, what I have heard
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  I mean, there are people who came to me
[2:35:41.000 --> 2:35:43.000]  Let's use the term anonymously
[2:35:43.000 --> 2:35:46.000]  Because they feared for their careers at NIH
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  At CDC, at FDA
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:50.000]  And I mean, they feared for their safety
[2:35:50.000 --> 2:35:51.000]  And their family
[2:35:51.000 --> 2:35:54.000]  And they discussed with me while I was at HHS
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:56.000]  Just opposite the Capitol building
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  And they said, you know, Paul
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:00.000]  We like what you're saying behind the scenes
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  We cannot say what you're saying
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:03.000]  But we agree with you
[2:36:03.000 --> 2:36:05.000]  And the fact of the matter is, you know
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:07.000]  I had this relationship with people where
[2:36:07.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  They would confide in me pretty much
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:14.000]  And basically what I understood was
[2:36:14.000 --> 2:36:17.000]  Do you have these alphabet agencies with the deep state
[2:36:17.000 --> 2:36:19.000]  And the deep state is real
[2:36:19.000 --> 2:36:21.000]  I work there, I can tell you
[2:36:21.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  The deep state is that bureaucracy
[2:36:23.000 --> 2:36:25.000]  And they work and they conspire
[2:36:25.000 --> 2:36:27.000]  They basically explain to me
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:30.000]  Their job on a day-to-day basis
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:33.000]  Was to make President Trump's presidency
[2:36:33.000 --> 2:36:36.000]  In terms of the lockdowns and the response
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:39.000]  Unmanageable, ungovernable and chaotic
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:41.000]  And I have the quote right
[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:43.000]  Redfield admitted this to you
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.000]  Well, I mean, Dr. Redfield
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:51.000]  I asked him one day about the social distancing
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  Let me give you an example
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  And I said, you know, Dr. Redfield
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:56.000]  Where do we get the science?
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  Where do we get the science, the CDC
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:00.000]  About this social distancing
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:02.000]  And Dr. Redfield basically explained
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:04.000]  That it was made up
[2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:07.000]  And I can tell you that when Scott Gottlieb
[2:37:07.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  Said that post-Redfield
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  I knew I was vindicated
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:13.000]  Because I was saying that it was made up
[2:37:13.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  And I got that from the CDC
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:17.000]  And when Scott Gottlieb said it
[2:37:17.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  There was no scientific basis
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:22.000]  We just arbitrarily made up CDC
[2:37:22.000 --> 2:37:23.000]  Six feet
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  And there was no science to back it up
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  And we closed society
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  We locked schools down
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  We damaged businesses
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:33.000]  People committed suicide over that six feet rule
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:36.000]  That six feet rule ended people's lives
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  Incredible
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:41.000]  And so why do you think the rats
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:43.000]  Are leaving the sinking ship now?
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.000]  Because it obviously didn't go the way they wanted it to
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:47.000]  How do you think as an expert and insider
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:49.000]  They were planning it to go
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:50.000]  Versus the way it's gone
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:52.000]  And how would you describe the political, biomedical,
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Ethical climate we're in right now?
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:57.000]  Well, I think the climate that we're in right now
[2:37:57.000 --> 2:37:59.000]  Is not a good climate
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:01.000]  And I think that they did not understand
[2:38:01.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  That the McCallers and this woolly hobby
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  Reaches to myself
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:07.000]  People like yourself, et cetera
[2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  And I'll even give credit to people like
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:10.000]  Laura Ingraham on Fox
[2:38:10.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  Even Tataka Carlson on Fox
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Who are fighting
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  Those are the ones in the media
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:17.000]  Who are giving us the platforms and the forums
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:20.000]  They didn't anticipate us that we would push back
[2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  And that whilst all of these scientists
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:24.000]  And doctors stood down
[2:38:24.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  To protect their salaries
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:27.000]  That we decided to fight
[2:38:27.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  And I think if we did not
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  They would have overrun the society
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  I think parents right now
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Were so confused
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  And when we saw the recent Kaiser
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:38.000]  Report
[2:38:38.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  That only 45% of parents have taken
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:42.000]  The shot
[2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  Post the FDA approval of the
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Of the six month, five year old vaccine
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  That was vindication for us
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:50.000]  Because that showed us
[2:38:50.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  That parents are critical thinkers now
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  And they're listening to what we're seeing
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  I was about to say as bad as everything's been
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  They're having the lowest uptake of vaccines
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  Period
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  Even though some vaccines are good
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:03.000]  Obviously they could have side effects or problems
[2:39:03.000 --> 2:39:04.000]  We should admit that
[2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.000]  But this isn't a vaccine
[2:39:05.000 --> 2:39:08.000]  But super low uptake
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  Of the new booster of all this
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  The people have really woken up it seems
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:13.000]  Yes, the people have woken up
[2:39:13.000 --> 2:39:16.000]  And the challenge with that then is
[2:39:16.000 --> 2:39:18.000]  What we would call it as the deep state
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  Or the players involved
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  They seem they're not going to stop
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:24.000]  They have just authorized this bivalent booster
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:25.000]  That was my next question
[2:39:25.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  What are they going to do next?
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:28.000]  The bivalent booster
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  It's almost dead on arrival
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  Before it even leaves
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:34.000]  Because on one hand it includes the Wuhan strain
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:36.000]  Which is the present Wuhan strain
[2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:39.000]  That is causing all of the variants
[2:39:39.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  That we see emerging
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  And it's based on a BA5-clade sub-variant
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  That we know by the time they bring it
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  Will actually be displaced by other variants
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  So we have the same problem
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  In other words, if you want to keep this pandemic
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:57.000]  On going for 100 more years
[2:39:57.000 --> 2:39:59.000]  You keep vaccinating the public
[2:39:59.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  Using these mRNA vaccines in the exact same way
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  You change nothing
[2:40:03.000 --> 2:40:04.000]  This will never end
[2:40:04.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  And they know that
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:07.000]  But not everybody is a top scientist
[2:40:07.000 --> 2:40:09.000]  Explain this to us
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  Like we're freshman high schoolers
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:14.000]  Explain it to us
[2:40:14.000 --> 2:40:16.000]  How giving them the shot keeps it going
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  Well, the thing about it is
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:21.000]  The reality is that this vaccine
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  Became non-neutralizing
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:26.000]  So that means that the antibodies
[2:40:26.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  That were induced originally were not neutralizing the virus
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  That means stopping infection or transmission
[2:40:32.000 --> 2:40:36.000]  So once we got antibodies that were non-neutralizing
[2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  We know from basic immunology and biology
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:42.000]  That once you vaccinate using a non-sterilizing
[2:40:42.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  Non-neutralizing vaccine
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  That induces non-neutralizing antibodies
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  That will not eliminate or stop the virus
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  Then you are going to cause
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  Selection pressure to play a role
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  Natural selection, Darwinian natural selection
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  Will select the variants that are most
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Fittest and hardiest
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  Those will overcome the
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.000]  Vaccinal pressure, immune pressure
[2:41:08.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  And become enriched in the environment
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  Those will become the new dominant variants
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:15.000]  As you have seen in Omicron
[2:41:15.000 --> 2:41:18.000]  So they're using us as the factory to create the new virus
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Well, putting it the way you're saying it
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:24.000]  Again, if you keep vaccinating the way we have
[2:41:24.000 --> 2:41:26.000]  With these mRNA platforms
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  This pandemic will never end
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:30.000]  We will go from infectious
[2:41:30.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  And Goethe van den Boschers warned
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:34.000]  And I take his warning very seriously
[2:41:34.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  That it is not just about an infectious variant
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:38.000]  That will emerge
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:40.000]  It is going to be a potentially
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:42.000]  Virulent lethal one
[2:41:42.000 --> 2:41:44.000]  That could actually threaten humanity
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:46.000]  So this is a very serious matter
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  These vaccines
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:48.000]  And they know exactly what they're doing
[2:41:48.000 --> 2:41:50.000]  It must be stopped
[2:41:50.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  You're talking about, man, this is so sick
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  What about all the reports that lowers immunity?
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Of course it lowers immunity
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:41:59.000]  We have a lot of science right now that shows
[2:41:59.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  It suppresses the immune system
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  We've actually, we have science to show that
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:06.000]  If you already COVID recovered
[2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  And you have natural immunity
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  Your recovered immunity in place
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  And you layer it with
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  Vaccinal antibodies, the immunity from the vaccine
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  You are more likely going to end up in the hospital
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:18.000]  We have research from Crema, Matteo Dacus
[2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  Sure, we'll talk about the next segment
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:21.000]  But just to layman point
[2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:23.000]  We don't, I guess, have the numbers
[2:42:23.000 --> 2:42:26.000]  Even if a minority of fools keep taking the shots
[2:42:26.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  They're going to be the petri dish
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:29.000]  Or the incubator for the superfires
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:31.000]  Yes, of course
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  And the reality about it is
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:37.000]  There's no way out of the box that we are in
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:41.000]  Unless we stop this vaccine program
[2:42:41.000 --> 2:42:42.000]  We have to stop it
[2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:45.000]  And if you, at this point, go
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:47.000]  If children are in the crosshairs right now
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:50.000]  If we go towards these children and vaccinate these children
[2:42:50.000 --> 2:42:52.000]  The science is...
[2:42:52.000 --> 2:42:53.000]  Let's talk about the children
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:54.000]  I interrupt you early
[2:42:54.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  Let's give the children one come back
[2:43:24.000 --> 2:43:25.000]  Green fiber capsules

[2:43:47.000 --> 2:43:49.000]  We're all under globalist attack

[2:43:57.000 --> 2:43:59.000]  Several years ago
[2:43:59.000 --> 2:44:02.000]  I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[2:44:02.000 --> 2:44:05.000]  That supplies the highest quality signature
[2:44:05.000 --> 2:44:07.000]  Reducing faraday cages to the Pentagon
[2:44:07.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  And other U.S. government agencies
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:12.000]  And now they have produced specifically for us
[2:44:12.000 --> 2:44:13.000]  This made in America
[2:44:13.000 --> 2:44:17.000]  Onioned line at a very affordable price
[2:44:17.000 --> 2:44:19.000]  Whether it's small palates that protect your cell phone
[2:44:19.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  Or big palates that protect laptops
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:24.000]  Or iPads or big bags
[2:44:24.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  That promote whatever electronics you want to put in
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  Like desktop computers
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:30.000]  It is all exclusively available

[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  Corporations, governments
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:44:53.000]  It is one of the hottest items out there today
[2:44:53.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  That's exclusively available at infowarstore.com
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:01.000]  Get our great bag of it here
[2:45:01.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  I mean this is from, people say
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:06.000]  Why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.000]  Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[2:45:08.000 --> 2:45:11.000]  That's wild harvested above organic
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  In the volcanic soil
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:13.000]  Better than Guatemalan coffee
[2:45:13.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:17.000]  That the media calls communists
[2:45:17.000 --> 2:45:18.000]  But really they're just a commune
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:19.000]  And whatever the point is
[2:45:19.000 --> 2:45:21.000]  Is that it's good coffee and we've got it
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:23.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:27.000]  And I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[2:45:27.000 --> 2:45:28.000]  And the price has never gone up
[2:45:28.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:31.000]  For about 50% more
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  For a pound
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:35.000]  You're gonna find anywhere
[2:45:35.000 --> 2:45:36.000]  It's Wake Up America
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:37.000]  Patriot Blend
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  From the Chiapas rebels
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  Literally
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:41.000]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:45.000]  We had like that
[2:45:45.000 --> 2:45:46.000]  I'm not saying you wouldn't believe it
[2:45:46.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  Anyway, so
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  It's infowarstore.com
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  And that's how we fund this operation
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:52.000]  And if you don't fund us
[2:45:52.000 --> 2:45:53.000]  You don't want to see it, that's fine
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:00.000]  Everybody knows that high quality fish oil
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  Does fantastic things for your cardiovascular system
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  For your brain
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:06.000]  For every part of your body
[2:46:06.000 --> 2:46:08.000]  But what I don't see being promoted
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:10.000]  Is the fact that it has
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:12.000]  Natural
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.000]  Psychotropic effects
[2:46:14.000 --> 2:46:16.000]  It certainly does for me
[2:46:16.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  When I take a couple of these capsules
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:19.000]  An hour before bed
[2:46:19.000 --> 2:46:20.000]  My sleep
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  My dreams
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:22.000]  Are amazing
[2:46:22.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  Now there are actually some studies out there
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  Linking it
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:26.000]  To amazing
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:28.000]  Events in the brain
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:29.000]  But I want you
[2:46:29.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  To experience it yourself
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:32.000]  We know it's good for your heart
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:33.000]  We know it's good for your brain
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  We know it's good for your arteries and veins
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  And your lungs
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.000]  And every other function in your body
[2:46:37.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  But
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  I want you to experience

[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  You're really going to miss out if you don't get it.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:34.000]  Well as negative as things are
[2:47:34.000 --> 2:47:37.000]  The world is awakening
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:39.000]  And speaking of the world
[2:47:39.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  Number one book in the world

[2:48:01.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  At infowarstore.com
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:03.000]  All right
[2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:05.000]  Dr. Paul E. Alexander
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  PhD
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:07.000]  Dr. Paul Alexander.com
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:09.000]  Travelling the country on his own
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:10.000]  Dying to become warm people
[2:48:10.000 --> 2:48:12.000]  You wanted to get into the children
[2:48:12.000 --> 2:48:13.000]  But you have another message to Trump
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  But you've been interrupted twice by breaks
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:17.000]  They're going out for six month olds
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  And up as the science shows
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:19.000]  Now that we're dying
[2:48:19.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  Our races are immune system
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:21.000]  All sorts of health problems
[2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:23.000]  You wanted to get to the children
[2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:24.000]  You've got the floor
[2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  Go ahead
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:26.000]  Well again, thanks very much
[2:48:26.000 --> 2:48:29.000]  Look, I think the message I want to get out here is
[2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.000]  I don't think President Trump really understood
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:34.000]  How much did the lockdowns
[2:48:34.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  And the school closures hurt him
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:39.000]  The lockdowns devastated the United States
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:41.000]  And I think Fauci and Berks
[2:48:41.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  And Francis Collins
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:44.000]  And they knew what they were doing
[2:48:44.000 --> 2:48:45.000]  They were damaging the society
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:46.000]  With these lockdowns
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  And I think history will show
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:51.000]  That the lockdowns that happened in America
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.000]  Was probably the greatest public health decision ever
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:57.000]  America was the most productive, spun up dynamo
[2:48:57.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  And hadn't come back since then
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  No, it has not
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:02.000]  We're in a lot of trouble
[2:49:02.000 --> 2:49:04.000]  And with the new administration
[2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.000]  I mean, as you can see
[2:49:05.000 --> 2:49:08.000]  I think that some modelers said
[2:49:08.000 --> 2:49:11.000]  That it will take the rest of the 21st century
[2:49:11.000 --> 2:49:13.000]  So that's 80 more years
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:14.000]  For the United States to get back
[2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:15.000]  To where it was
[2:49:15.000 --> 2:49:17.000]  And the devastating effects
[2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  On children emotionally, psychologically
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:22.000]  Education-wise
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  And notice, China would only lock down the city
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  To sell the idea
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:27.000]  They didn't lock their whole country down
[2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:29.000]  No, and that's another thing
[2:49:29.000 --> 2:49:31.000]  That's why we need the investment
[2:49:31.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  We need proper investigation
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:35.000]  And there have been some recent, really good discussions
[2:49:35.000 --> 2:49:37.000]  Between Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[2:49:37.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  And this sacks guy
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:41.000]  And it was very interesting
[2:49:41.000 --> 2:49:42.000]  A recent publication
[2:49:42.000 --> 2:49:44.000]  So what they were talking about
[2:49:44.000 --> 2:49:47.000]  That unison between eco-health
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:50.000]  And Chapel Hill University
[2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  And it raises a lot of issues
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  And what I wanted to say, Alex, is this
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:57.000]  For the Americans and for you
[2:49:57.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  I did a stint at Johns Hopkins
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  In 2001 in biological warfare
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:04.000]  I had the privilege of working under
[2:50:04.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  Donald Henderson
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  Who evaluated smallpox
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  Small program in bioterrorism
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  I wanted to learn how you could defend
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  A city from biological attack
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:13.000]  Back then
[2:50:13.000 --> 2:50:15.000]  And then we looked at smallpox
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  Antrax, Q fever, etc
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:19.000]  The thing is
[2:50:19.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  For me as a scientist
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:23.000]  And somebody with background in bio warfare
[2:50:23.000 --> 2:50:24.000]  And stuff
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:26.000]  I look at it from this point of view
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  It could have been
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  The United States government, the military
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:31.000]  Let's see
[2:50:31.000 --> 2:50:33.000]  And it would have been prudent in their part
[2:50:33.000 --> 2:50:35.000]  To do some sort of research
[2:50:35.000 --> 2:50:36.000]  Background research
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:38.000]  On if these viruses and pathogens
[2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Could be weaponized by bad actors
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:41.000]  In the world
[2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.000]  And used against the United States
[2:50:43.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  How would we be able to respond?
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  The issue is, will other people
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:49.000]  Did they get into the system
[2:50:49.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  And did they use this
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.000]  Whatever was being done nefariously
[2:50:53.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Did they use this against the United States?
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  Was this a deliberate release?
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:01.000]  Was this an accidental release?
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  What really happened there?
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:04.000]  We need a proper, proper examination
[2:51:04.000 --> 2:51:06.000]  Well, even the British Medical Journal
[2:51:06.000 --> 2:51:08.000]  Is now saying it looks like it was done
[2:51:08.000 --> 2:51:10.000]  As a lab made product
[2:51:10.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  So they're having to basically admit that now
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:14.000]  Absolutely, this was lab made
[2:51:14.000 --> 2:51:16.000]  All of the evidence about wet markets
[2:51:16.000 --> 2:51:18.000]  Zoonosis, spillover
[2:51:18.000 --> 2:51:20.000]  That is garbage, that is not real
[2:51:20.000 --> 2:51:22.000]  All science point of this
[2:51:22.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  Being man made in a laboratory
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.000]  They took it out of the wild
[2:51:26.000 --> 2:51:27.000]  Of course
[2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:28.000]  But they took it into the lab
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  And they juiced this up
[2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  They introduced the furan cleavage site
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  And they made this very infectious and lethal
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:36.000]  And I guess the point is
[2:51:36.000 --> 2:51:38.000]  I want to shift quickly to the children
[2:51:38.000 --> 2:51:39.000]  Because this is very important
[2:51:39.000 --> 2:51:41.000]  Children come
[2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:44.000]  And I take a lot of tone from Dr. van den Bosch
[2:51:44.000 --> 2:51:46.000]  So I'm speaking from that point of view
[2:51:46.000 --> 2:51:48.000]  Children come with what we call
[2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:50.000]  The first line of immune defense
[2:51:50.000 --> 2:51:52.000]  Called the innate immunity
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:53.000]  All children
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  After the maternal antibodies wean
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:58.000]  Children must initiate and kick start
[2:51:58.000 --> 2:52:00.000]  This innate immune system
[2:52:00.000 --> 2:52:02.000]  Is the first line of defense
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:04.000]  On the immunological battlefield
[2:52:04.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  The reality is though
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  That what we've found is that
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:11.000]  If you vaccinate with these COVID injections
[2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:15.000]  The antibodies derive their high affinity
[2:52:15.000 --> 2:52:18.000]  They have much more binding affinity
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:20.000]  To the spike antigen
[2:52:20.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  They would subvert and out-compete
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:26.000]  The innate antibodies the children bring
[2:52:26.000 --> 2:52:28.000]  And the innate immune system
[2:52:28.000 --> 2:52:30.000]  And children will not be properly trained
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:32.000]  Why is this important?
[2:52:32.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  That immune training that a child
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:36.000]  Goes through very early on in life
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  That these vaccines would subvert
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:40.000]  Helps a child's immune system
[2:52:40.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  To differentiate what belongs to the child
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:45.000]  And what belongs to other
[2:52:45.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  So that the immune system of a child learns
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:51.000]  Pretty early on for the rest of their life
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  What it should attack
[2:52:53.000 --> 2:52:55.000]  That does not belong to it
[2:52:55.000 --> 2:52:56.000]  And what it should leave alone
[2:52:56.000 --> 2:52:57.000]  So they're destabilizing children
[2:52:57.000 --> 2:52:59.000]  They're not just going to have their immune system erased
[2:52:59.000 --> 2:53:01.000]  They're going to have allergies
[2:53:01.000 --> 2:53:03.000]  But we're beginning to see that now
[2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  Children are going to have what we call
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:07.000]  Autoimmune reactivity
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:08.000]  That's the issue
[2:53:08.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  A lot of allergic reactions
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:11.000]  And autoimmune diseases
[2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:13.000]  Going to escalate in the future
[2:53:13.000 --> 2:53:15.000]  Because in that ability to differentiate
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:17.000]  Self from non-self
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:19.000]  That is what autoimmune disease is
[2:53:19.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  Children are going to do
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:23.000]  As van den Bosch said in using his terminology
[2:53:23.000 --> 2:53:25.000]  We run the risk of placing children
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:27.000]  On a path towards death
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:29.000]  Well you were a trailblazer
[2:53:29.000 --> 2:53:31.000]  Exposed this early on so
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.000]  Speculating 35,000 of you
[2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:35.000]  The whole thing was incredibly premanitated
[2:53:35.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  I absolutely think
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:39.000]  I absolutely think that
[2:53:39.000 --> 2:53:41.000]  Whatever was happening in the beginning
[2:53:41.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  In terms of if there was
[2:53:43.000 --> 2:53:45.000]  Research taking place that involved
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  United States military, government
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:48.000]  Etc
[2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:50.000]  It may have had
[2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:52.000]  May have had a benevolent view
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:53.000]  At that point
[2:53:53.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  But somewhere in there
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:53:57.000]  Other players got involved
[2:53:57.000 --> 2:53:58.000]  Particularly farmer
[2:53:58.000 --> 2:54:01.000]  Particularly places like Faison, Madonna
[2:54:01.000 --> 2:54:03.000]  Just a money-making venture also
[2:54:03.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  Exactly, so the Pentagon worked to deal with threats
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:07.000]  But they actually made the weapon
[2:54:07.000 --> 2:54:08.000]  Because that's what they do
[2:54:08.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  They build the response to weapons
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:10.000]  Somebody may do
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:11.000]  And then somebody else grabbed it up
[2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:13.000]  And used it because
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:14.000]  We mentioned the British Medical Journal and others
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:15.000]  They're not saying
[2:54:15.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  Not only was it made in the lab
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:18.000]  Maybe the U.S. made it
[2:54:18.000 --> 2:54:19.000]  Which is what the Chinese said
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Two and a half years ago
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:21.000]  Yeah, well I mean
[2:54:21.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  And look Alex
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  Let's be fair here
[2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:27.000]  If you told me the United States government
[2:54:27.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  Because of this former Soviet Union
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  Because of China, because of other nations
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  We're engaging in biological research
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:35.000]  I would sit back and say
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:37.000]  Well you know that's probably very risky stuff
[2:54:37.000 --> 2:54:38.000]  But if they know what they're doing
[2:54:38.000 --> 2:54:41.000]  And they could safeguard the society
[2:54:41.000 --> 2:54:43.000]  In case of a biological attack
[2:54:43.000 --> 2:54:45.000]  Well then they should
[2:54:45.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  Now it has to be done prudently
[2:54:46.000 --> 2:54:47.000]  And the way it should be
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  The question becomes
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:51.000]  Were other players involved
[2:54:51.000 --> 2:54:53.000]  Who usurped what was being done
[2:54:53.000 --> 2:54:57.000]  For proper benevolent means
[2:54:57.000 --> 2:54:58.000]  Did they take advantage of this
[2:54:58.000 --> 2:55:00.000]  Did they get in there
[2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.000]  Look, I'll be as frank as I could
[2:55:02.000 --> 2:55:04.000]  Was this virus used
[2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.000]  To damage President Trump
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:08.000]  I'm not a scientist
[2:55:08.000 --> 2:55:09.000]  Well Fauci said the first month of Trump
[2:55:09.000 --> 2:55:10.000]  There'll be a new novel virus
[2:55:10.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  That challenges him
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:13.000]  Well yes
[2:55:13.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  There was a new novel virus
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:15.000]  That challenged him
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:18.000]  But what we've seen is that
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:20.000]  In the response to this virus
[2:55:20.000 --> 2:55:22.000]  We knew very early on
[2:55:22.000 --> 2:55:24.000]  That as long as you protected the elderly
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  And the vulnerable in society
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  Even with this initial Wuhan strain
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:30.000]  You protect them properly
[2:55:30.000 --> 2:55:31.000]  Strongly
[2:55:31.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  We use early treatment
[2:55:32.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  We told them what they needed to do
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  You use early treatment
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:37.000]  You use vitamin D3 etc
[2:55:37.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  But you let the rest of society
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:40.000]  Live normal lives
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:42.000]  We did not need to lock down
[2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  We did not need to close schools
[2:55:43.000 --> 2:55:45.000]  And cause so much suicides
[2:55:45.000 --> 2:55:47.000]  We could have let everybody live normally
[2:55:47.000 --> 2:55:49.000]  Becoming new naturally
[2:55:49.000 --> 2:55:51.000]  And we would have been done of this
[2:55:51.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  Way before we are today
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:54.000]  We have now generated
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:57.000]  Omicron variant with this vaccine
[2:55:57.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  Which is why they never created a vaccine
[2:55:59.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  For the cold right
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:01.000]  Because it would create mutants
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  Of course
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  It's almost impossible for you
[2:56:04.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  To create a vaccine
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  For a respiratory type virus
[2:56:08.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  Because so much mutations
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:12.000]  That take place
[2:56:12.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  So I'm not a scientist like you
[2:56:13.000 --> 2:56:14.000]  But I know that
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  So obviously they knew what this would do
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  Yes they knew what this was
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:18.000]  And they know
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  That if you continue
[2:56:19.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  As we were saying in the earlier segment
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:23.000]  If you continue vaccinating
[2:56:23.000 --> 2:56:25.000]  With a non-neutralizing vaccine
[2:56:25.000 --> 2:56:26.000]  Which this is
[2:56:26.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  That introduces
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:30.000]  Non-neutralizing antibodies
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:33.000]  You cannot stop transmission
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  And you cannot stop infection
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:37.000]  You therefore cannot
[2:56:37.000 --> 2:56:39.000]  Cut the chain of transmission
[2:56:39.000 --> 2:56:41.000]  With a vaccine that does not
[2:56:41.000 --> 2:56:43.000]  Stop infection or transmission
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:44.000]  And your own words though
[2:56:44.000 --> 2:56:45.000]  You're saying this
[2:56:45.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  Statistically could create a super virus
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:49.000]  Absolutely because we are going
[2:56:49.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  From infectious variant
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:52.000]  After infectious variant
[2:56:52.000 --> 2:56:54.000]  And there's a chance always
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  Because of the selection pressure
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:58.000]  That you are placing on the antigen
[2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  That a very lethal
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  Subvariant can emerge
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:03.000]  Absolutely
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  And I know they can't do it in a lab
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.000]  But with billions of people
[2:57:05.000 --> 2:57:07.000]  They can create it
[2:57:07.000 --> 2:57:09.000]  Well we are the playground
[2:57:09.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  And as you see
[2:57:10.000 --> 2:57:12.000]  With this new bi-villain booster
[2:57:12.000 --> 2:57:14.000]  That Pfizer and they are pushing
[2:57:14.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  That's what Bill Gates famously said
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  Two and a half years ago
[2:57:17.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  This is really just a test
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  But the terrorist he sees as humanity
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:24.000]  Are about to release a bio-web
[2:57:24.000 --> 2:57:25.000]  That will kill billions
[2:57:25.000 --> 2:57:27.000]  He's telling you we're the terrorist
[2:57:27.000 --> 2:57:28.000]  He sees the humans as bad
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:30.000]  And the joke is they're going to make us
[2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:32.000]  Create the thing that kills us
[2:57:32.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  Yeah and Alex you know
[2:57:33.000 --> 2:57:35.000]  What is devastating here
[2:57:35.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  They've brought this bi-villain vaccine
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:38.000]  That they're touting
[2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  Based on research on 8 mice
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Just 8 mice
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  Let's talk about the 8 mice
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:57:43.000]  When we come right back
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:44.000]  Okay
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  The rage
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:50.000]  For more than a decade
[2:57:50.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  Have been concentrated green powders
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  With wheatgrass
[2:57:55.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  And so many other ingredients
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  That are known to make us healthy
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:00.000]  To make us vibrant
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:02.000]  And to defend our immune systems
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:04.000]  Now over a year and a half ago
[2:58:04.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  We came out with a product
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:06.000]  That was top sourced
[2:58:06.000 --> 2:58:09.000]  Topped the line as good as it's going to get
[2:58:09.000 --> 2:58:11.000]  But then the supply chain broke down
[2:58:11.000 --> 2:58:13.000]  And it was sold out for more than a year
[2:58:13.000 --> 2:58:15.000]  Finally green fiber capsules
[2:58:15.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  This big old bottle jam-packed

[2:59:44.000 --> 2:59:45.000]  Try taking some before bedtime
[2:59:45.000 --> 2:59:47.000]  And see what happens with your dreams
[2:59:50.000 --> 2:59:52.000]  If you are receiving this transmission
[2:59:52.000 --> 2:59:55.000]  You are the resistance
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:04.000]  Dr. Paul E. Alexander
[3:00:04.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  Worked in the Trump administration
[3:00:06.000 --> 3:00:08.000]  And he's here with us for two more segments
[3:00:08.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  That had Jason Bermas taking over
[3:00:10.000 --> 3:00:12.000]  But the big takeaway here is
[3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  And I've seen these similar syndromes
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  And chickens
[3:00:16.000 --> 3:00:17.000]  And poultry
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  Where they vaccinate them over and over again
[3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  Against different types of bird flu
[3:00:21.000 --> 3:00:25.000]  And different viruses
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:27.000]  And then suddenly
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  It doesn't work anymore
[3:00:28.000 --> 3:00:30.000]  But they have a master vaccine they give
[3:00:30.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  But then the bird mutates
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  And has all these diseases
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:34.000]  All these problems
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:35.000]  It was almost like a zombie that's still alive
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  So in layman's terms
[3:00:37.000 --> 3:00:39.000]  They admit the mainline science
[3:00:39.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  Giving people shots
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  During a pandemic over and over again
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  Will naturally select and create a super virus
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:46.000]  Yeah, well I mean
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  The danger is that you don't ever
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  Vaccinate into a pandemic
[3:00:51.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  Into an epidemic or pandemic
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:00:56.000]  Because there's tremendous infectious pressure out there
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  On the mountain immune response
[3:00:59.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  And the reality is that
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:03.000]  You want the antibodies that are induced
[3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:05.000]  To be neutralizing antibodies
[3:01:05.000 --> 3:01:07.000]  That are going to eliminate the virus
[3:01:07.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  That is going to stop infection
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:10.000]  Stop transmission
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  Stop replication
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  We do not have that here
[3:01:13.000 --> 3:01:14.000]  And that's the issue
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  As long as you place pressure
[3:01:17.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  You are placing pressure on the antigen
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  So much so that you are causing it to evolve
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:25.000]  And I think the issue here is
[3:01:25.000 --> 3:01:28.000]  Those involved they seem to underestimate
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  The evolutionary capacity of the virus
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  To adapt and evolve to the pressure
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:36.000]  From the lockdowns to the masks
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:38.000]  But then Bill Gates says he wants to kill us
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  So you're saying oh they're making a mistake
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  Looks pre-planned to me
[3:01:41.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  It looks to be honest with me
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  As I said before
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  If you wanted to keep this pandemic
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.000]  On going non-stop
[3:01:51.000 --> 3:01:54.000]  And for us to generate infectious variant
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  After infectious variant
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:01:58.000]  Then we keep using these sorts of
[3:01:58.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  mRNA vaccines
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.000]  Gene platform delivery systems
[3:02:04.000 --> 3:02:06.000]  And you would get infectious variant
[3:02:06.000 --> 3:02:08.000]  After infectious variant immersion
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:09.000]  You will never be able to stop
[3:02:09.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  Because we cannot cut the chain of viruses
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:13.000]  And that's why they keep doing the boosters
[3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:14.000]  And after every booster
[3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  Whether it's Israel or Australia
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  The U.S. sickness spikes have every shot
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:19.000]  Yes and what we're seeing is
[3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:22.000]  That you are now on what we call the booster treadmill
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  You can't get off of it
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:25.000]  So now they went from six, eight months
[3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:28.000]  To six months to four months to two months
[3:02:28.000 --> 3:02:30.000]  Now we are seeing data that's showing us
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  That in a matter of weeks
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:34.000]  The vaccine efficacy, it wins
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:36.000]  Dung into negative efficacy territory
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  So that means it's not only that it's zero
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:41.000]  The vaccine is actually driving infection
[3:02:41.000 --> 3:02:42.000]  That's what we are seeing
[3:02:42.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  We are seeing there are some good studies
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:47.000]  By our good research by Fantini et al
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  And one by Liu et al
[3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:51.000]  That shows us that what is happening is
[3:02:51.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  That they induced antibodies
[3:02:53.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  That are not neutralizing
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.000]  They can still, they're not just useless
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  They can still bind to the spike antigen
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  But in binding, they are giving the virus
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:05.000]  A property they did not have before
[3:03:05.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  They give the virus a very infectious property
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  In other words, the vaccinated person becomes infected
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:15.000]  So this was never a pandemic of the unvaccinated
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  We knew, we knew very early on
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:20.000]  This was a pandemic of the vaccinated
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:22.000]  And the CDC lied to the public
[3:03:22.000 --> 3:03:24.000]  By running to the podium and saying
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  What the CDC did was
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:31.000]  Most of the infections, cases, hospitalizations
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:34.000]  And death, post-vaccine
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  Happens right then about the first week
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:40.000]  So the CDC redefined what being vaccinated was
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  And they claimed that you have to get to 14 days post
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  For you to be considered vaccinated
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  So if you had fought there after the vaccine
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:51.000]  And you got hospitalized or even died
[3:03:51.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  CDC counted you as an unvaccinated person
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:55.000]  And that was the lie
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  That was the deceit that caused them to push
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  More vaccines and the boosters
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  They actually redefined vaccination
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  Which was actually a fraudulent step by the CDC
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:10.000]  So can it stop this great mutinogenic
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:13.000]  Godzilla rising and so many are refusing
[3:04:13.000 --> 3:04:15.000]  Or do they just need a small target group
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  To be able to incubate this next mutation
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  Well, I think when you even listen to Dr. McCullough
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:24.000]  Or myself or other van den Bosch
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:27.000]  We are calling for a carte blanche stop
[3:04:27.000 --> 3:04:30.000]  We want a hard stop on this vaccine
[3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  Across the board for all age groups
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:34.000]  There is no evidence right now
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  No science that shows us that the emergency is done
[3:04:38.000 --> 3:04:39.000]  We have no more emergency
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:42.000]  Omicron presents us a mile cold now
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  I mean, we still have to protect higher
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  But if people keep taking the shot
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:46.000]  They can create the super virus
[3:04:46.000 --> 3:04:48.000]  Yes, if you keep vaccinating people
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:49.000]  We will never stop
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  All right, final segment of our amazing guest
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:55.000]  Dr. Paul Alexander
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  Stay with us
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:59.000]  Donald Trump and the Martin Republicans
[3:04:59.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  Represent an extremism that threatens
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  The very foundations of our republic
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't have
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  An operational name
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  In fact, I bet it does
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  I bet it's called Operation Matador
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:15.000]  They see us as the bull
[3:05:15.000 --> 3:05:19.000]  And they are shaky, a red flag in our face
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:21.000]  And the Matador is the deep state
[3:05:21.000 --> 3:05:24.000]  With a long, skinny, razor-sharp sword
[3:05:24.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  So that when the bull lunges forward
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  The Matador uses the force of its weight
[3:05:28.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  To drive it into the heart
[3:05:30.000 --> 3:05:32.000]  And step aside with his cape
[3:05:32.000 --> 3:05:35.000]  As the bull buries himself into the dust
[3:05:35.000 --> 3:05:37.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  Which is false flags
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags
[3:05:41.000 --> 3:05:43.000]  That's the first thing you do
[3:05:43.000 --> 3:05:45.000]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:46.000]  Bad guys start wars
[3:05:46.000 --> 3:05:49.000]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  They stage an event
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  This is Operation Matador
[3:06:02.000 --> 3:06:04.000]  You are either with the republic
[3:06:04.000 --> 3:06:06.000]  Or against it
[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:08.000]  Resistance to tyrants
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:10.000]  Is obedience to God
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  It's Alex Jones
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:16.000]  Well, I'm really impressed, alexandrecomednews.com
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:18.000]  I've seen many videos of him
[3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:20.000]  I've seen him at big conferences, two and a half years ago
[3:06:20.000 --> 3:06:21.000]  He warned everybody
[3:06:21.000 --> 3:06:22.000]  This guy's impressive
[3:06:22.000 --> 3:06:24.000]  He's here in studio with us
[3:06:24.000 --> 3:06:26.000]  And he's horrifying me because
[3:06:26.000 --> 3:06:28.000]  I'm a layperson, but I know
[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:30.000]  They never gave people a cold vaccine
[3:06:30.000 --> 3:06:33.000]  Because they said it's great, it's super virus
[3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  And a bunch of other bad effects
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:39.000]  And now they've done it
[3:06:39.000 --> 3:06:41.000]  Obviously they're not stupid
[3:06:41.000 --> 3:06:43.000]  But they're playing
[3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  So my question is
[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:47.000]  Is almost 2% uptake now
[3:06:47.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  Versus 50% a year and a half ago
[3:06:49.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  Is that going to stop them?
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:53.000]  What do the booster shots do?
[3:06:53.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  Because this is just crazy
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  Please continue
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  Well, I mean Alex
[3:06:58.000 --> 3:07:00.000]  We have data out of the UK
[3:07:00.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Out of Scotland, out of Australia
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  Out of Denmark, et cetera
[3:07:04.000 --> 3:07:06.000]  Across the world that shows us
[3:07:06.000 --> 3:07:08.000]  That actually it's the third shot
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  And the fourth shot
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  The first booster and second
[3:07:11.000 --> 3:07:13.000]  That we're actually seeing the vaccine
[3:07:13.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  To become highly infected
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:18.000]  And by the way, they have British Michael's Journal
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  93% of people dying triple-vax
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:23.000]  So that's why they have to fire three FDA boards
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  To finally get one that would approve this
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  So they know what they're doing
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  Explain this
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:31.000]  Well, I mean, in terms of the triple-vax
[3:07:31.000 --> 3:07:33.000]  The thing about it is
[3:07:33.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  The data actually settles itself out
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:38.000]  To show us that not with the first vaccine
[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  The first shot or the second
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:43.000]  We began to see deaths post-second shot
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:45.000]  But with the third shot
[3:07:45.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  The booster and the fourth
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:49.000]  What we actually saw in the Scottish data
[3:07:49.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  And they took their reporting down
[3:07:51.000 --> 3:07:54.000]  And the UK was that there was a surge
[3:07:54.000 --> 3:07:57.000]  In infections, hospitalizations and deaths
[3:07:57.000 --> 3:07:59.000]  And it was a very scary situation
[3:07:59.000 --> 3:08:02.000]  To the sense that when we looked at the studies
[3:08:02.000 --> 3:08:03.000]  By Fantini et al
[3:08:03.000 --> 3:08:05.000]  That it helped explain to us
[3:08:05.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  Why would a vaccinated person
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:11.000]  Become so much more infected
[3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  Than an unvaccinated person
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  And they laid out the mechanisms
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:17.000]  And do that
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  But what's crazy is
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:20.000]  For those who just tuned in
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  It's now admitted mainstream news
[3:08:22.000 --> 3:08:23.000]  The shot makes you sick
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Arranges your immune system
[3:08:25.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  Yes, well, the science is clear now
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:29.000]  We have the data across the world
[3:08:29.000 --> 3:08:33.000]  That tells us that those who take the vaccine now
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:35.000]  Look, you just have to look at your
[3:08:35.000 --> 3:08:37.000]  Look around you and your family
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:38.000]  Look at your friends and your colleagues
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  And your co-workers
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  How many of them have had the vaccine
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  Boosters included and have gotten very sick
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  How many of them have gotten re-infected
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  So no one is saying
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:52.000]  No one is saying
[3:08:52.000 --> 3:08:54.000]  I want to be very clear here
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  No one is saying that COVID was not a problem
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:58.000]  COVID presented a serious problem
[3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:00.000]  It was made in the lab, it was released
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:02.000]  Yes, but it was a problem for
[3:09:02.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  High-risk persons
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  Today, we know still that
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:07.000]  The median age of death is 82
[3:09:07.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  You need to understand something
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  The age of death for COVID
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:16.000]  Actually is the normal life expectancy
[3:09:16.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  Is about 77, 78, 79
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:21.000]  The average median age of death
[3:09:21.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  Average age of death to a person
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  Who dies around 82
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:26.000]  COVID has not cut people's lives short
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  That's a very important thing
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:30.000]  So they have made this pathogen
[3:09:30.000 --> 3:09:32.000]  That we could have managed
[3:09:32.000 --> 3:09:34.000]  With early treatment
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:35.000]  That we could have managed
[3:09:35.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  With proper protection of the high-risk persons
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:40.000]  Particularly morbidly obese persons
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:41.000]  We could have managed this
[3:09:41.000 --> 3:09:42.000]  But they took this
[3:09:42.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  And they made it into a catastrophe
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  And they're not stopping
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:49.000]  Now they're pushing this by valent booster
[3:09:49.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  And all we see down the line
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  Is more infectious variants
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  So we need to start
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:09:55.000]  I've shown the numbers
[3:09:55.000 --> 3:09:57.000]  Mainline for the UNZO numbers
[3:09:57.000 --> 3:09:59.000]  Every time they give a booster shot
[3:09:59.000 --> 3:10:01.000]  The sickness and hospitalization
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:02.000]  And death skyrockets
[3:10:02.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  Absolutely
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:04.000]  And that's what the data shows
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  I'm not a doctor
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  But if a rattlesnake bites me
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  And my legs swells up
[3:10:08.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  The rattlesnake did it
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:10.000]  Or if a spider bites me
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:12.000]  Or if I drink liquor and get drunk
[3:10:12.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  I'm not a doctor
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:16.000]  But I know that the liquor made me drunk
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:17.000]  This is killing people
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  You can see it
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:20.000]  If you got up and punched me in the face
[3:10:20.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  My nose was bloody
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:23.000]  I don't need to be an epidemiologist
[3:10:23.000 --> 3:10:24.000]  Or a pathologist
[3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  Or a doctor to know
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  You punched me in the nose
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:27.000]  I have a bloody nose
[3:10:27.000 --> 3:10:29.000]  I mean, it's causal
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  It's prima facie
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:31.000]  Yes, but...
[3:10:31.000 --> 3:10:33.000]  And Alex, it's because in the past
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:36.000]  Since SARS-1 2003
[3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  They've done many, many experiments
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:40.000]  Using this mRNA gene delivery platform
[3:10:40.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  That's right, for decades
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  They're secretly testing it
[3:10:42.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  And magically they roll it out
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:46.000]  Yeah, but the key is they failed
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  All of the prior studies
[3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:50.000]  On the animal models and stuff failed
[3:10:50.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  Many of the animals got sick
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  And many of them died
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  That's right
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:55.000]  All of them failed
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  They admitted mainstream news
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  It was a dead technology
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  And then suddenly they roll it out
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:00.000]  Knowing it was gonna fail
[3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  Yes, well, that's the thing
[3:11:01.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  And what the public needs to understand is this
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:07.000]  Up to today, no cost benefit
[3:11:07.000 --> 3:11:10.000]  No risk benefit analysis has ever been done
[3:11:10.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  Where on the response in terms of lockdowns
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  Where on these vaccines
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  In terms of what was the optimal approach
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  For the society
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:19.000]  Let me ask this question, doctor
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  If they know they have a failed
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  Gene therapy, gene platform
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  Why roll a failed
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  Because if it's meant to help us, it's failed
[3:11:29.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  But if it's meant to hurt us, it works great
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:33.000]  Like UT, as you know, did studies
[3:11:33.000 --> 3:11:35.000]  Eight, nine years ago with Fauci under Obama
[3:11:35.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  And they found the rats died taking the stuff
[3:11:37.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  So like a gun to like cure your headache
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  Doesn't work, but to kill you it does
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:45.000]  So we're looking at it as like
[3:11:45.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  Why are they rolling out something that's failed
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  But if it's meant to hurt you
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  And slowly kill you, it's a big success
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  Well, absolutely
[3:11:52.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  If you ask me, if Dr. Alexander
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:58.000]  If you wanted to create a bioweapon
[3:11:58.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  If you wanted to create a biological weapon today
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:05.000]  That can slow kill, harm and slow kill the population
[3:12:05.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  I will tell you bring these mRNA gene platforms
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:09.000]  Exactly like this
[3:12:09.000 --> 3:12:11.000]  Exactly how you have this, bring it
[3:12:11.000 --> 3:12:14.000]  This is a biological weapon to me
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  That has been released
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:17.000]  And I have biological terrorism
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  Bioterrorism training in my background
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  The reality is which should be shocking people is this
[3:12:23.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  Recently the FDA approved this bivalent new shot
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:32.000]  Based on the Wuhan strain plus the BF4, BF5
[3:12:32.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  Clayed subvariant as the component of the vaccine
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  But what do we know?
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:42.000]  We know that the only human data came from the BF1 strain
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  Therefore it's not even applicable to the BF5
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:47.000]  What they've based their decision on with the BF5
[3:12:47.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  That they've just approved the bivalent shot
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:52.000]  Was based on 8 mice
[3:12:52.000 --> 3:12:55.000]  A rodent study, 8 mice have now decided
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  The fate of the United States
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  And potentially will follow America
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:02.000]  They want to investigate, they want to vaccinate
[3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:06.000]  200 million Americans based on data from 8 mice
[3:13:06.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  And we even have information that mice actually got COVID
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:11.000]  So the study failed
[3:13:11.000 --> 3:13:13.000]  So we don't understand what's going on with the FDA
[3:13:13.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  The FDA, which should be our marquee
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  It's a hijacked organization
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  It's hijacked, we don't understand what's going on
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:22.000]  They're not safeguarding the health and the welfare
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  Of the American people
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:26.000]  The CDC fails right now
[3:13:26.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  It's a political organization
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:30.000]  I agree, I want to take the last two minutes
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  And put it up front in this interview
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:33.000]  We're live right now, millions watching
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:35.000]  But this video needs to get 10 million views, folks
[3:13:35.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  Or 50 million
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  What you just said about it premeditated by a weapon
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:44.000]  It's there and they're planning as Gates said
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  Oh, this is just a drill
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  But the terrorists are about to release the new virus
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:13:50.000]  I said almost two and a half years ago
[3:13:50.000 --> 3:13:52.000]  I said, because I watched Gates, I go
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.000]  This is going to make us create some super virus
[3:13:54.000 --> 3:13:56.000]  I had a bunch of scientists on
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:13:58.000]  He's telling us, oh, this is a drill
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  But the terrorists are about to release the real weapon
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  He sees this as a terrorist
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:04.000]  He's telling us, we're about to release the weapon
[3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:05.000]  That kills us
[3:14:05.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  Yeah, and I've read a lot of stuff on Gates
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.000]  Since it's begun
[3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:12.000]  You know, I have a lot, a lot of questions now
[3:14:12.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  On his role in all of this
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  And the reality now is we are facing a situation today
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:21.000]  Societally in America where they brought
[3:14:21.000 --> 3:14:24.000]  They call it a vaccine
[3:14:24.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  We call it an inoculation or an injection
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  We won't say it's a vaccine in a classical sense
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  But they bought something that failed
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  It literally failed out of the box
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  When Pfizer submitted their data
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:40.000]  To the FDA for approval
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  They actually had data that they omitted
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  3,000 subjects
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  But when we rerun the numbers
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  That 95% relative risk reduction
[3:14:48.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  Dropped to under 20%
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:53.000]  In other words, it was not even meeting the 50% threshold
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:54.000]  That was set
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  We also argued they were fraudulent
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:00.000]  In claiming 95% relative risk reduction
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  Which has been proven
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:03.000]  Alexander Cubin news on Substack
[3:15:03.000 --> 3:15:05.000]  Alexander Cubin news, sorry, finish your point
[3:15:05.000 --> 3:15:07.000]  Yeah, what we're saying is they should have reported
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  The absolute risk reduction
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  It's the absolute benefit that we needed to know
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:14.000]  When you looked at the Pfizer data
[3:15:14.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  It was 0.7%
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:18.000]  Not 95% relative risk reduction
[3:15:18.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  What does that mean?
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  From Pfizer to FDA
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  There's some collusion
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  Something that has happened between these parties
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:29.000]  That they have defrauded the American people
[3:15:29.000 --> 3:15:32.000]  With those initial emergency use authorizations
[3:15:32.000 --> 3:15:35.000]  That's right, Alexander Cubin news on Substack
[3:15:35.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  Alexander, thank you doctor
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:39.000]  Paul E. Alexander, DrPaulAlexander.com
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.000]  Join us again soon, God bless you
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  Jason Burmes takes over right now
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  Spread the word, he's got a big broadcast

[3:15:49.000 --> 3:16:17.000]  Thank you
[3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:19.000]  There is nothing stopping we the people
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  From making our own rules
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  And building our own society
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  All we got to do is survive the crash
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  And right now we still have time to prepare
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:31.000]  The world fiat currency system
[3:16:31.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  Is racing towards zero
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:36.000]  It's time to convert it into hard assets
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:40.000]  Now, including food, water and survival gear
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:42.000]  To keep us strong and at the ready

[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:01.000]  And I believe the most powerful
[3:17:01.000 --> 3:17:03.000]  The man in the arena coin
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:05.000]  Teddy Roosevelt

[3:17:16.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  It's not just an amazing historic coin
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:20.000]  It funds the information war
[3:17:20.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  Against the globalist

[3:17:26.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  And as a fundraiser, it is
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:30.000]  Funding the information war
[3:17:30.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  Against the globalist

[3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:04.000]  It's Alex Jones
[3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  Hey everybody
[3:20:14.000 --> 3:20:15.000]  Jason Vermas here
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  And for the remainder of the hour
[3:20:17.000 --> 3:20:19.000]  We are going to be talking about
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:21.000]  Transhumanism
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:23.000]  We are going to be talking about
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:25.000]  The executive order
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  That Biden has signed on to
[3:20:27.000 --> 3:20:28.000]  We are going to be talking about
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:31.000]  NASA, space warfare
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  Cancer, moonshot
[3:20:33.000 --> 3:20:36.000]  And so much more
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:38.000]  But what I wanted to start out with
[3:20:38.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  If you caught my last presentation here
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:43.000]  From transgender to transhuman
[3:20:43.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  I featured a conference
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:47.000]  Put on by the
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  Azos owned Washington Post
[3:20:49.000 --> 3:20:51.000]  Sponsored by Samsung
[3:20:51.000 --> 3:20:53.000]  And Lockheed Martin
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:55.000]  Called Transformers
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  In 2016
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:00.000]  And in that
[3:21:00.000 --> 3:21:03.000]  It was openly discussed
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:06.000]  That they would be taking a nano
[3:21:06.000 --> 3:21:08.000]  Satellite skin
[3:21:08.000 --> 3:21:10.000]  That would encompass the globe
[3:21:10.000 --> 3:21:12.000]  And be utilized
[3:21:12.000 --> 3:21:15.000]  For all types of warfare
[3:21:15.000 --> 3:21:17.000]  And beyond
[3:21:17.000 --> 3:21:19.000]  And that is exactly
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:21.000]  What we are seeing in the Ukraine
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:23.000]  Folks, it's not just
[3:21:23.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  A proxy war
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:27.000]  As Alex Jones stated yesterday
[3:21:27.000 --> 3:21:29.000]  These systems
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:31.000]  Starlink in particular
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  And its classified cousin
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  Blackjack are being utilized
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:37.000]  With ghost and sidewinder
[3:21:37.000 --> 3:21:39.000]  Drones that are killing
[3:21:39.000 --> 3:21:41.000]  People in mass
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:43.000]  And before I play you
[3:21:43.000 --> 3:21:45.000]  This clip from Transformers
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  I want to point out
[3:21:47.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  That Ukraine's astronomers
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  Say there are tons of UFOs
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  Over Kiev
[3:21:53.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  Really?
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:21:57.000]  UFOs you say
[3:21:57.000 --> 3:21:59.000]  And what people have to understand
[3:21:59.000 --> 3:22:01.000]  Is this is
[3:22:01.000 --> 3:22:03.000]  Classified technology
[3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:05.000]  In most cases
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:07.000]  Run via
[3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:09.000]  Black programs
[3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:11.000]  Because NASA's not about taking us to the moon
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  Or Mars
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:15.000]  That's a very, very small part
[3:22:15.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  It is about transhumanism
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  Space warfare
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:21.000]  And beyond
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  So in this conference
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  Let's have one of their little representatives
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  And Minion again
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  NASA, DARPA
[3:22:29.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  Transhumanism
[3:22:31.000 --> 3:22:33.000]  It's all part of the same narrative
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:35.000]  And the same brand
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:37.000]  But let George White
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:39.000]  Sides tell you
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:41.000]  About this system
[3:22:43.000 --> 3:22:45.000]  Through ISS has been sort of
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  Seeding the small sat market
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  And
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:51.000]  But you can't launch into all the different orbits
[3:22:51.000 --> 3:22:53.000]  From ISS and so
[3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:55.000]  What we'll be able to do with our vehicle
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  Launcher one is to put
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:22:59.000]  These satellites into other orbits
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:01.000]  But I think what's interesting is that
[3:23:01.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  The US is now leading a new area
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:05.000]  Which is the small satellite sector
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:07.000]  And
[3:23:07.000 --> 3:23:09.000]  You're going to see tremendous growth
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:11.000]  The geostationary
[3:23:11.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  The number of geostationary satellites
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  Getting launched into orbit isn't really growing right now
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:17.000]  But you're going to see this huge growth
[3:23:17.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  In small satellite constellations
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:21.000]  Over the coming years
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  That will establish essentially a new
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  Information skin for planet Earth
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  That
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  Helps us with navigation and communication
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  And weather and remote sensing
[3:23:31.000 --> 3:23:33.000]  And I think it will be eventually sort of a permanent
[3:23:33.000 --> 3:23:35.000]  New skin around the planet
[3:23:35.000 --> 3:23:37.000]  And a lot of that is being catalyzed
[3:23:37.000 --> 3:23:39.000]  By the work
[3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.000]  That was done inside NASA labs
[3:23:41.000 --> 3:23:43.000]  And now inside the national lab at ISS
[3:23:43.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  And we cannot forget
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:47.000]  About Elon Musk
[3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:49.000]  And SpaceX itself
[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:51.000]  This is the ex-NASA chief
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  Of staff that you just saw
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  Under the Obama
[3:23:55.000 --> 3:23:57.000]  Administration
[3:23:57.000 --> 3:23:59.000]  And I want to point out
[3:23:59.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  That Elon Musk who is being heralded
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  As a hero by many
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  All the way back in April
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:07.000]  Donated over three and a half
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:09.000]  Thousand
[3:24:09.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  Of these starlink terminals
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:13.000]  Reports have over
[3:24:13.000 --> 3:24:15.000]  12,000 of those
[3:24:15.000 --> 3:24:17.000]  Satellite systems currently
[3:24:17.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  Being used there
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:21.000]  Interesting
[3:24:21.000 --> 3:24:23.000]  And that is not
[3:24:23.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  Part of what?
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:27.000]  The actual Lockheed Martin
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  Program
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  Blackjack
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:33.000]  In unison with one another
[3:24:33.000 --> 3:24:35.000]  Because
[3:24:35.000 --> 3:24:37.000]  Musk is really there
[3:24:37.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  For this DARPA
[3:24:39.000 --> 3:24:41.000]  SpaceX merger
[3:24:41.000 --> 3:24:43.000]  Okay, his job
[3:24:43.000 --> 3:24:45.000]  Is to move
[3:24:45.000 --> 3:24:47.000]  What technology
[3:24:47.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  All over the world within an hour
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:51.000]  Those are the military contracts
[3:24:51.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  That this guy is a part of
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:55.000]  In fact, Cash Patel
[3:24:55.000 --> 3:24:57.000]  Who I would argue is one of the better people
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  Inside the Trump Administration
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:01.000]  Who openly talked about
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:03.000]  On Fox News
[3:25:03.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  How he was their number one
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:07.000]  Contractor
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:09.000]  Let's go to that clip right now
[3:25:09.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  He is doing some cool stuff
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:13.000]  In space and everything
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  He's doing a ton of stuff that you would think
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  Is so global
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:19.000]  He is literally launching this thing called Satellink
[3:25:19.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Which almost no one knows about
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  But he's been building for five years
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  Which is free wifi for the world
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:27.000]  Which is amazing
[3:25:27.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  I can be in Central Sahara, Africa
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  And get wifi on my $3 million phone
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:33.000]  But they're not
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:35.000]  If you've actually watched one of these Satellink link uploads
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  It's like a string of pearls being dropped in the night sky
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:39.000]  It's really cool
[3:25:39.000 --> 3:25:41.000]  We're all paying for it, this is why he's so rich
[3:25:41.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  DOD's biggest contractor
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:45.000]  Is Elon Musk
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  Oh
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:49.000]  The DOD's biggest contractor
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  Is Elon Musk
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  So let's talk
[3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  Nanosats for a moment
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:57.000]  I often go
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  To this future strategic warfare document
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  By Dennis Bushnell
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  The chief scientist
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  Over at NASA
[3:26:05.000 --> 3:26:07.000]  To this day, a guy that's been around since the Gemini program
[3:26:07.000 --> 3:26:09.000]  A document
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.000]  From 2001
[3:26:11.000 --> 3:26:13.000]  And one of the first things we see
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  When we talk about blast wave accelerators
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  Which is a type of what
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  Warfare
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  In fact, you can see one of these
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  Blast wave accelerator diagrams
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Again, all the way back
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:27.000]  In 2001
[3:26:27.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  In this document, you'll notice
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  Nanosats on the bottom
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:33.000]  Nanosats come up quite a bit
[3:26:33.000 --> 3:26:35.000]  In this document
[3:26:35.000 --> 3:26:37.000]  If you see it here, you'll see that they are
[3:26:37.000 --> 3:26:39.000]  Inexpensive
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  And they are overhead systems
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:43.000]  Ubiquitous with
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  UAVs
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  Both military and commercial
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  Blackjack military
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  Starlink commercial
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:53.000]  And this preceded all of these things
[3:26:53.000 --> 3:26:55.000]  By over a
[3:26:55.000 --> 3:26:57.000]  Deck aid
[3:26:57.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  If you see the future of warfare
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  You have mini micro and
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:03.000]  Nanosats
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  Along with UAVs
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:07.000]  They also mentioned binary and biological
[3:27:07.000 --> 3:27:09.000]  Weaponry in this
[3:27:09.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  As well
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:13.000]  And get you ready for robotics
[3:27:13.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  Automatics at the
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  Large
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  Now, if you keep going
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:21.000]  You'll notice
[3:27:21.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  And it's magnitude
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:25.000]  In this type of warfare
[3:27:25.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  You also get bio, chemical, molecular
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  Nanocomputing
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:31.000]  With these sensors
[3:27:31.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  Again, it's not just the internet of things
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  It's the internet of bodies
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  That's why they get into cyber and artificial life
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  When we start talking about the transhumanist
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:41.000]  Aspect
[3:27:41.000 --> 3:27:43.000]  We're going to get into the genomic repair
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:45.000]  And design of the human species
[3:27:45.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  Again, in this document
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:49.000]  But I really thought this part
[3:27:49.000 --> 3:27:51.000]  Was telling Trojan
[3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:53.000]  Horse everything
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  Ships, boats, planes
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:57.000]  Cars, trucks, packages
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  Cargo, containers
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  Targeted effects
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  Including tidal waves
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:05.000]  EMPs, earthquakes
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:07.000]  Radiation, and of course
[3:28:07.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  Blast, aka the blast wave
[3:28:09.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  Accelerator. They are telling you
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:13.000]  That this type of technology
[3:28:13.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  Is stealth. They are telling you
[3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000]  They can control certain aspects
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:19.000]  Of the weather
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:21.000]  And beyond. They are telling you
[3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:23.000]  It is not going to come
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  Via the means of
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  The military
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  But these privatized
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  Trojan, horse, civilian
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:33.000]  Systems. This is
[3:28:33.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  The techno-fascist
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  Partnership
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:39.000]  That is out in the open. When we come back
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  We're going to examine
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  Not only that document
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  Biden's executive order
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  Remember to support infowars.com
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:49.000]  Right now, if you haven't gotten the great
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  Reset in the war for the world
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  Make sure you order it. Today we will be back
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:55.000]  On the flip side, infowarsstore.
[3:28:55.000 --> 3:28:57.000]  Everybody knows that
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:28:59.000]  High quality fish oil
[3:28:59.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  Does fantastic things for your cardiovascular
[3:29:01.000 --> 3:29:03.000]  System, for your brain
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  For every part of your body
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:07.000]  But what I don't see being promoted
[3:29:07.000 --> 3:29:09.000]  Is the fact that it has
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  Natural
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  Psychotropic effects
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  It certainly does for me. When I take a couple
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:17.000]  Of these capsules an hour before bed
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  My sleep, my dreams are
[3:29:19.000 --> 3:29:21.000]  Amazing. Now there are actually
[3:29:21.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  Some studies out there linking it
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:25.000]  To amazing
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:27.000]  Events in the brain. But I want
[3:29:27.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  You to experience it yourself
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:31.000]  We know it's good for your heart. We know
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:33.000]  It's good for your brain. We know it's good for your arteries
[3:29:33.000 --> 3:29:35.000]  And veins and your lungs. And every other
[3:29:35.000 --> 3:29:37.000]  Function in your body. But I want
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:39.000]  You to experience this high-grade fish oil

[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:51.000]  At infowarsstore.com
[3:29:51.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  Thank you all for your support. You're really going to miss out
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  If you don't get it.
[3:29:57.000 --> 3:29:59.000]  Get our great
[3:29:59.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  Bag of it here. I mean this is from
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:03.000]  People say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico
[3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:05.000]  The communist. Well that's where
[3:30:05.000 --> 3:30:07.000]  Some of the best coffee in the world
[3:30:07.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  Wild harvested above organic
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  In the volcanic soil. Better than
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:13.000]  Guatemalan coffee. And yeah, we buy it from
[3:30:13.000 --> 3:30:15.000]  The little farmers that the media calls
[3:30:15.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  Communists. But really they're just a commune.
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  And we've got it. And the farmers don't let the Mexican
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:23.000]  Government take over. So I actually buy this from
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  The Mexican rebels. And I've been buying it for what
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  14 years and the price has never gone up. The same stuff
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:29.000]  Sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:31.000]  For about 50% more. For pound and
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:33.000]  I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find
[3:30:33.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  Anywhere. It's Wake Up America. Patriot blend
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:37.000]  From the Chiapas rebels. Literally.
[3:30:37.000 --> 3:30:39.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:41.000]  Um
[3:30:41.000 --> 3:30:43.000]  We had like that
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:45.000]  I think you wouldn't believe it. Anyway
[3:30:45.000 --> 3:30:47.000]  So it's infowarstore.com
[3:30:47.000 --> 3:30:49.000]  And that's how we fund this operation
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:51.000]  And if you don't fund us and don't want to share that's fine
[3:30:55.000 --> 3:30:57.000]  Experience the next level
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:30:59.000]  And high powered energy new tropics
[3:30:59.000 --> 3:31:01.000]  With our latest brain force offering
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:03.000]  Brain Force Ultra. Now it is
[3:31:03.000 --> 3:31:05.000]  Easier than ever to take in the new
[3:31:05.000 --> 3:31:07.000]  Liquid form with eight beneficial
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:09.000]  Super ingredients. Brain Force Ultra
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:11.000]  Is the result of years of enhanced
[3:31:11.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  Formulation. Three of toxic
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:15.000]  Additives each ingredient is specifically
[3:31:15.000 --> 3:31:17.000]  Selected for its many key properties.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:19.000]  Some of the proprietary
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:21.000]  Super ingredients behind Brain Force Ultra
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:23.000]  Include Aroma seed
[3:31:23.000 --> 3:31:25.000]  Which is loaded with energy compounds
[3:31:25.000 --> 3:31:27.000]  And antioxidants that have been used
[3:31:27.000 --> 3:31:29.000]  By Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[3:31:29.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  Alpha GPC
[3:31:31.000 --> 3:31:33.000]  A natural compound found in the brain
[3:31:33.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  That delivers an essential nutrient
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:37.000]  Co-Leap and Ginko Leap
[3:31:37.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  Which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:41.000]  This product is more than twice
[3:31:41.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  The servings of our Brain Force Plus
[3:31:43.000 --> 3:31:45.000]  As well. So you know it's packed full of the good stuff.

[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:49.000]  Today and secure your bottle
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:51.000]  Of Brain Force Ultra
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:53.000]  Before it is completely sold out
[3:31:53.000 --> 3:31:55.000]  At infowarstore.com
[3:31:55.000 --> 3:31:57.000]  People ask me all the time
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:31:59.000]  What is your best new tropic?
[3:31:59.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  You've got Turbo Force
[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:03.000]  You've got Brain Force Plus
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:05.000]  And you've got Brain Force Ultra
[3:32:05.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  Which one is better?
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  And that's like asking
[3:32:09.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  What's better, a Ford F-150
[3:32:11.000 --> 3:32:13.000]  Or a Cadillac
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:15.000]  Or a Ferrari
[3:32:15.000 --> 3:32:17.000]  It's different strokes for different folks
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:19.000]  It varies
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  All three are different formulas
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:23.000]  All three do different things
[3:32:23.000 --> 3:32:25.000]  Turbo Force is 10 hours of clean
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:27.000]  Out of control energy
[3:32:27.000 --> 3:32:29.000]  I'm going to take a whole pack myself
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  Brain Force Plus is a
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:33.000]  Long term acting clean
[3:32:33.000 --> 3:32:35.000]  This Brain Force Ultra
[3:32:35.000 --> 3:32:37.000]  Is a super fast acting
[3:32:37.000 --> 3:32:39.000]  Neutropic
[3:32:39.000 --> 3:32:41.000]  Creates incredible clarity
[3:32:41.000 --> 3:32:43.000]  But doesn't last very long
[3:32:43.000 --> 3:32:45.000]  They're all three different formulas
[3:32:45.000 --> 3:32:47.000]  And finally, back at stock
[3:32:47.000 --> 3:32:49.000]  Massively discounted
[3:32:49.000 --> 3:32:51.000]  Brain Force Ultra is available
[3:32:51.000 --> 3:32:53.000]  At infowarstore.com
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:32:55.000]  Brain Force Ultra
[3:32:55.000 --> 3:32:57.000]  Brain Force Ultra
[3:32:57.000 --> 3:32:59.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[3:32:59.000 --> 3:33:01.000]  On the lies of the New World Order
[3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  It's Alex Jones
[3:33:11.000 --> 3:33:13.000]  We are back, it is the Alex Jones show
[3:33:13.000 --> 3:33:15.000]  I am Jason Bermas
[3:33:15.000 --> 3:33:17.000]  And we are going to move on
[3:33:17.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  To the poofy pants
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  Puppet President
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  And his latest
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  Executive Order
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:27.000]  As well as Cancer Moonshot
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  Which you may have missed
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  You see, when Biden was running
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  He was talking about a DARPA-like
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  Program
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  To end cancer
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:39.000]  And lo and behold, that DARPA-like
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  Program is not only
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  The Defense Department
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  But NASA itself
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:47.000]  And you can read this
[3:33:47.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  We can cure cancers once and for all
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:51.000]  Oh, this technology
[3:33:51.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  Is going to empower us
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  We're going to slash deaths by half
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:33:57.000]  Within 25 years
[3:33:57.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  You scroll down
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  And this woman right here
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  Is a part of both DARPA
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:05.000]  And NASA
[3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  And when Joe Biden
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  Was trying to read off his prompter
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  He went almost 90 seconds
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  With only a couple stumbles
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  Some of his better moments
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  He actually mentions NASA
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  That's why we continuously harp
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  On that organization
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  But don't take my word for it
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:25.000]  Take zombie J's
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:27.000]  As a Biden, this Cancer Moonshot
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:29.000]  Is one of the reasons why
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  I ran for president
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  There's always a reason why he ran for president
[3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Cancer Moonshot, that's one of them
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  It's part of my unity agenda
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:39.000]  That I laid out in my State of the Union
[3:34:39.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  Address
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:43.000]  To rally the American people to work together
[3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  Because we know this
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:47.000]  Cancer does not discriminate
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  Red and blue
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  It doesn't care if you're a Republican
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  Or a Democrat
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:55.000]  Beating cancer is something
[3:34:55.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  We can do together
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:34:59.000]  And that's why I'm here today
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  As part of the SuperCharge Moonshot
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  I'll use my authorities
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:07.000]  As president
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:09.000]  To increase funding
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:11.000]  To break log jams
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  And to speed breakthroughs
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:15.000]  I've also formed a new Cancer Cabinet
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  That's driving a whole of government
[3:35:17.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  Efforts to unleash every possible asset
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  Within our power
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:23.000]  From NASA
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:25.000]  That knows more about radiation
[3:35:25.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  Than any doctor does
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:29.000]  To the Defense Department
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  That has the ability to calculate an energy department
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  Through a million billion calculations per second
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  Million billion calculations per second
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:37.000]  Log jams
[3:35:37.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  Blah blah blah blah blah
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  But think about what he just said
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:43.000]  Now he also talked about the energy department
[3:35:43.000 --> 3:35:45.000]  If anybody wants to go back
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  Into history
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  And check out what the Department of Energy did
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  Via human experimentation
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:53.000]  You need only go to the Clinton Administration
[3:35:53.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  When he had to walk out
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  In public
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  With a binder about that big
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  On the horrific human experimentation
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  That was done unknowingly
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  On soldiers and citizens
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:07.000]  Alike
[3:36:07.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  These are black programs
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  In many instances
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  But I promise you
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  They are not here to empower humanity
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:17.000]  They are here to enslave us
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  Under this biotech nightmare
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  This document
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:23.000]  Executive order on advancing biotechnology
[3:36:23.000 --> 3:36:25.000]  And biomanufacturing innovation
[3:36:25.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  For a sustainable
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:29.000]  There's that word again
[3:36:29.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  What sustainable means
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  It means your standard of living
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:35.000]  Plomits
[3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  That's what it means
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  Safe and secure
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:41.000]  Your credit score
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  Your carbon credit score
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  They intend that to be in the internet
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:47.000]  Of bodies as well
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  Forget about just track trace database
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:51.000]  They want everything
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  Internally
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  Here's just a small subsection for everybody
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  For biotechnology
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  And biomanufacturing to help us achieve
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  Our societal goals
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  And their societal goals
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  Are to take hold of the evolution
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  Of everything openly
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  And it discusses that in the document
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  We're going to go back to
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  And in person as we've shown you here
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  Where he admits in 2018
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  They've already put 200,000 brain chips
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  In people
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  But hey, to achieve those societal goals
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  The United States needs to invest
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  In foundational scientific capabilities
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  We need to develop
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  Genetic engineering
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  Technologies
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  And techniques to be able to
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  Write circuitry for cells
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  And predictably program biology
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  In the same way
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  In which we write software
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  And program computers
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  Again, this is what
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  The transgender non-binary
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  Zeroes and one's agenda
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  Is all about to equate you
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  Not to
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  A human being
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  A being with a spirit
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:37:59.000]  A soul, actual consciousness
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  But nothing more
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:03.000]  Than a number, a nobody
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  A nothing
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  To be subjugated to their
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:09.000]  Predator class power
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  They want to unlock the power
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  Of biological data
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:15.000]  Including through computing tools
[3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  And artificial intelligence
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  And advance the science of scale-up production
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  While reducing the obstacles
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  For commercialization
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  So that the innovative technologies
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  And products can reach markets faster
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  That is the
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:31.000]  Government partnership
[3:38:31.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  With these companies
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  These tech companies
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  For again outward
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  Biotech
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  Medical fascism
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Believe the hype
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  That is what this is 100%
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  About
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:49.000]  And people need to understand
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  It is not coming, it's here
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  And that's why we're going to play
[3:38:53.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  Dennis Bushnell telling you what
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:57.000]  The evolution of everything
[3:38:57.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  Is over, we're taking hold
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  Humans are now becoming
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  Cyborgs
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  We have cochlear implants to hear
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  Artificial retinas to see
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  Artificial hearts to live
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  Artificial limbs to move
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  Artificial organs to functions
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:15.000]  And brain shifts
[3:39:15.000 --> 3:39:17.000]  There's a couple hundred thousand people
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  Wandering around with brain shifts now
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  Defects can generate defective brains
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  And increasingly it affects memory
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  And other things
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  DARPA is working on brain shifts
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  For super soldiers
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  And people are now working thanks to
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  Musk and other people funding
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  Direct machine brain
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  Communications
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:39.000]  It's not us versus them
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  Us versus the machines
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  We're merging
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  Now before he gets into that merger
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  Notice Musk comes up again
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  Musk is going to be revealing
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  His Optimus bot
[3:39:51.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  I believe on September 29th or 30th
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  We're about two weeks away
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Okay and he's the one pushing
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  This technology which is decades old
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  Military industrial complex
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  Run via his
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  Neuralink commercially
[3:40:05.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  And being praised by guys
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  Like this that are about to tell you that
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  Evolution is over
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  We've taken control of evolution
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  And this is
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  The human evolution of the humans
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  There is no more
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  Natural evolution of anything
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  No more natural evolution of anything
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  People are convinced that
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  The human evolution of everything
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  Is 10 million times faster
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  Than any natural evolution
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  And so this is just part
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  Of the human evolution of the humans
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:37.000]  And if you look here
[3:40:37.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  At his own documentation
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  Again that's from 2018
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  This is from 2001
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  Humans have taken over
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  And vastly shortened evolution
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  Of the planet
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  Of the human species
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  And all products
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  And life forms
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  Including cross species
[3:40:57.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  Molecular breeding
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  And directed evolution
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:05.000]  The genomic design and repair
[3:41:05.000 --> 3:41:07.000]  Of the human species
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  Mind children
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  And it goes on
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  They talk about biohacking
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  They talk about how it is
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  Direct and undetectable
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  Fatal to disabling
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  Short to long term scales
[3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  They openly discussed
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  Utilizing this technology
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  As fingerprintless
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  Talk about plausible deniability
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  And here you see
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  That they have
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  Genomically targeted
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:39.000]  Pathetogens
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  Again fingerless campaigns
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  That go beyond their shock
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  And awe warfare
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  That we saw during
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  The Iraq war
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  They hadn't even used that terminology
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  For the Iraq war again
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  This is a 2001 document
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  They're talking about binary agents
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  Distributed via what?
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:01.000]  Vitamins, clothing, and food
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  And using
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  These genomic pathogens
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  For individuals
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  That's one on one
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  For entire societies
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  It's all right here
[3:42:13.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  It was all growing then
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  This is not pixie dust
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  This is a bio
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  Warfare document
[3:42:21.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  That is in your face
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  When we come back
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  We will expand
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  On the transhumanist aspect
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  Of this all
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:33.000]  What is going on right now
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  And how CBD sees
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  Digital currencies
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  The social credit score
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  The climate crisis
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  And a carbon agenda
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  Intertwined into
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  Everything you're seeing
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  Right now
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  This is infowars.com
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  Go get the great reset
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  The war for the world by Alex Jones
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  People ask me all the time
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  It's different strokes for different folks
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  It varies
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  Out of control energy
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  I can't even take a whole pack myself
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  Brain force plus is a
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  Long-term acting clean
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  This brain force ultra
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  Is a super fast acting
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  Neutropic
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  That creates incredible clarity
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  But doesn't last very long
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  They're all three different formulas
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  Back at stock
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  Brain force ultra is available

[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  Is fat burners
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  Is weight loss formulas
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  And listen, there are hundreds of them
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:07.000]  Out there that work
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  But most of them do it in a toxic way
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  We went out and did deep research

[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:19.000]  To take your overall body's metabolic system
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  And your metabolism
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  And turn that clock back
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  By turning up your metabolism

[3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  And so many other greenients that are known
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:07.000]  To make us healthy
[3:45:07.000 --> 3:45:09.000]  To make us vibrant
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  To defend our immune systems
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  Now over a year and a half ago
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:15.000]  We came out with a product that was top sourced
[3:45:15.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  Topped the line as good as it's going to get
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  But then the supply chain broke down
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:21.000]  And it was sold out for more than a year
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  Finally, green fiber capsules

[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:51.000]  They don't want you to have these essential nutrients

[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:01.000]  Donald Trump and the mighty republicans
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:03.000]  Represent an extremism
[3:46:03.000 --> 3:46:05.000]  That threatens the very foundations
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:07.000]  That doesn't have an operational name
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:09.000]  In fact, I bet it does
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:11.000]  I bet it's called operation
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  Matador
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  They see us as the bull
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  And they are shaky, a red flag
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  In our face
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  And the Matador is at each state with a long
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  Skinny razor sharp sword
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  So that when the bull lunges forward
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  The Matador uses the force of its weight
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  To drive it into the heart
[3:46:29.000 --> 3:46:31.000]  And step aside with his cape
[3:46:31.000 --> 3:46:33.000]  As the bull varies himself into the dust
[3:46:33.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  They've got the ace of spades in their hand
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  Which is false flags
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  Before you launch a war, you stage false flags
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:41.000]  That's the first thing you do
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  Because nobody wants to say they started a war
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:45.000]  Bad guys start wars
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:47.000]  So every time a war gets launched by bad guys
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  They stage an event
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:47:11.000]  This is operation Matador
[3:47:11.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  Final segment of the Alex Jones show
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  I am Jason Bermas
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  Sitting in, in the fourth hour
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  So how do they plan
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  On taking us
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:23.000]  Into this transhumanist nightmare
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  Well, selling us on a
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:27.000]  Virtual age
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:29.000]  And again, this document is looking
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  Decades ahead
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:33.000]  They talk about the year
[3:47:33.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  2030
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:37.000]  The IT Bionano
[3:47:37.000 --> 3:47:39.000]  Virtual technological
[3:47:39.000 --> 3:47:41.000]  Revolution
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  And in 2020
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:45.000]  Somehow they knew the Bionano era was coming
[3:47:45.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  Just saying all those mRNA technologies
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  That is Bionano technology
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:51.000]  They don't know how long this will last
[3:47:51.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  They got that 2030 in mind
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  To get you into what
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  The virtual age
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:47:59.000]  And I want to assure you
[3:47:59.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  That the virtual age
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  Actually goes far, far, far
[3:48:03.000 --> 3:48:05.000]  Beyond
[3:48:05.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  Just what they're trying to do with
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:09.000]  Metaverse governance and generating
[3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.000]  Economic and societal value
[3:48:11.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  With the World Economic Forum
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:15.000]  We have partnered
[3:48:15.000 --> 3:48:17.000]  But actually get you to believe
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:19.000]  That we are not only going to merge with machines
[3:48:19.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  But upload our consciousness
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:23.000]  And at the end of the day
[3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:25.000]  Dennis Bushnell tells you
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  Here we will have
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:29.000]  Human contaminated
[3:48:29.000 --> 3:48:31.000]  Machines and then we're going to go
[3:48:31.000 --> 3:48:33.000]  To Martin Rothblatt
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  The most powerful
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:37.000]  Transgender person
[3:48:37.000 --> 3:48:39.000]  On the planet, a billionaire
[3:48:39.000 --> 3:48:41.000]  The CEO of United Therapeutics
[3:48:41.000 --> 3:48:43.000]  The person with their own religion
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:45.000]  Tara Sim telling you
[3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:47.000]  About this upload
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:49.000]  And this cyber consciousness
[3:48:49.000 --> 3:48:51.000]  Now remember, transhumanism for them
[3:48:51.000 --> 3:48:53.000]  Is they're going to remain in these bodies
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  And have technology
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:57.000]  That empowers them
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  And then that same technology
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:01.000]  Will trick and enslave us
[3:49:01.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  Into thinking that our digital doppelgangers
[3:49:03.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  Are somehow an extension
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  Of our consciousness and ourselves
[3:49:07.000 --> 3:49:09.000]  This is Johnny Nonsense
[3:49:09.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  This is
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:13.000]  Bullshizzle McBizzle
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  So here he is
[3:49:15.000 --> 3:49:17.000]  Human contaminated machines
[3:49:17.000 --> 3:49:19.000]  We can have
[3:49:19.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  A high bandwidth
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  Comport built in
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:25.000]  So we don't have to use the sensors
[3:49:25.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  And they're very limited
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  To bandwidth
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  And eventually
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  This all ends up
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:35.000]  With uploading into the machines
[3:49:35.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  And instead of us versus them
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  Humans versus the machines
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  We become
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:43.000]  That
[3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:45.000]  Or they become us
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  Or you end up with human contaminated machines
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:49.000]  The Kitty Hawk type of project on this
[3:49:49.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  Being a 48 named for your lovely spouse
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  Which I have talked to in as many others
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:55.000]  It's sort of a head on a table
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  At this point, but it talks to you
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  And you would describe it
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:01.000]  This isn't the finished product
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:03.000]  Of where we want to go
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  But being a 48 is the Kitty Hawk
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  Of how this
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  You call them doppelgangers
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  Can you say robots?
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  Yeah, robots are just as good
[3:50:13.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  And if you put in
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:17.000]  I kind of have the idea like the matrix
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:19.000]  Where they were plugging stuff into the back
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  Of people's head
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  I have the idea that you upload everybody's personality
[3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  Or consciousness onto what amounts to a thumb drive
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  And then you can upload it to the cloud
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:29.000]  So you're always there
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:31.000]  And you can just plug it into a robot
[3:50:31.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  And there you are
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  Right, but it's becoming even
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  That's Being a 48 on the screen
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  And that was from a recent episode
[3:50:39.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  Of Morgan Friedman's
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  Series on the
[3:50:43.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  National Geographic Channel
[3:50:45.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  About the nature of God
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  And religion and whatnot
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  So we did this project
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:53.000]  To really inspire young people
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:55.000]  And I'd say young girls
[3:50:55.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  In particular to become coders
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  And when they have an opportunity
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  To speak with Being a 48
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  You can see that even today
[3:51:03.000 --> 3:51:05.000]  In our somewhat primitive 20 teens
[3:51:05.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  We're able to write software
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  That can respond idiosyncratically
[3:51:09.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  She doesn't give the same answer any two times
[3:51:11.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  And notice they're talking about
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  Indoctrinating the youth
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  They're talking about writing software
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  Just like that executive order
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:21.000]  We've got to learn to
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:23.000]  Write software for biology
[3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.000]  And then at the same time
[3:51:25.000 --> 3:51:27.000]  Get you to buy into this
[3:51:27.000 --> 3:51:29.000]  Virtual nonsense
[3:51:29.000 --> 3:51:31.000]  The author
[3:51:31.000 --> 3:51:33.000]  Of again
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:35.000]  From transgender to transhuman
[3:51:35.000 --> 3:51:37.000]  A manifesto on the freedom
[3:51:37.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  Of form
[3:51:39.000 --> 3:51:41.000]  Another book by Brett Rothblatt
[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:43.000]  Virtually human
[3:51:43.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  The promise and peril of digital
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:47.000]  Immortality
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:49.000]  Now at the same time
[3:51:49.000 --> 3:51:51.000]  This person is utilizing
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  Technology for xenotransplantation
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:55.000]  Now if you believe
[3:51:55.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  That the average person
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:51:59.000]  Is going to get a new kidney
[3:51:59.000 --> 3:52:01.000]  Or a heart because of this
[3:52:01.000 --> 3:52:03.000]  Look at how our medical system
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  Works now
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:07.000]  That is not the case
[3:52:07.000 --> 3:52:09.000]  At best we will be experimented on
[3:52:09.000 --> 3:52:11.000]  On this road
[3:52:11.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  To the belief
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:15.000]  That somehow we are part of
[3:52:15.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  The metaverse
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:19.000]  Or even the multiverse
[3:52:19.000 --> 3:52:21.000]  Or a simulation
[3:52:21.000 --> 3:52:23.000]  All of which equates you
[3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.000]  To programmable zeros
[3:52:25.000 --> 3:52:27.000]  And ones you don't have
[3:52:27.000 --> 3:52:29.000]  A real soul
[3:52:29.000 --> 3:52:31.000]  You don't have real consciousness
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  It's something that we can replicate
[3:52:33.000 --> 3:52:35.000]  In silicon
[3:52:35.000 --> 3:52:37.000]  And that is the ultimate
[3:52:37.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  Agenda
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:41.000]  In all of this
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:43.000]  It is one of dehumanization
[3:52:43.000 --> 3:52:45.000]  Command and control
[3:52:45.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  As they get you to accept less
[3:52:47.000 --> 3:52:49.000]  You will own nothing and be happy
[3:52:49.000 --> 3:52:51.000]  You will eat the bugs
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:53.000]  You will be part of projects like
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:55.000]  Nome and what is Nome
[3:52:55.000 --> 3:52:57.000]  And the line
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:52:59.000]  A lot of people talk about the United States
[3:52:59.000 --> 3:53:01.000]  When it comes to this
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:03.000]  They talk about China
[3:53:03.000 --> 3:53:05.000]  When it comes to this
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:07.000]  But it is truly, truly
[3:53:07.000 --> 3:53:09.000]  A global project
[3:53:09.000 --> 3:53:11.000]  What you're looking behind
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:13.000]  Is this ad and commercial
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  For the line
[3:53:15.000 --> 3:53:17.000]  Notice it looks very much like a virtual world
[3:53:17.000 --> 3:53:19.000]  Where you're going to fly and touch water
[3:53:19.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  And it's beautiful
[3:53:21.000 --> 3:53:23.000]  In reality what this is
[3:53:23.000 --> 3:53:25.000]  Is a dystopic
[3:53:25.000 --> 3:53:27.000]  Nightmare type system
[3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.000]  That you would see out of the hunger games
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  Where they compress and command you
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:33.000]  Into this city of control
[3:53:33.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  Where everything is only five minutes away
[3:53:35.000 --> 3:53:37.000]  Everything is regulated
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:39.000]  Through your social and carbon credit score
[3:53:39.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  Because they have to regulate that
[3:53:41.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  And that's one of NASA's big thing
[3:53:43.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  The ecosystem
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  Appears to be crashing
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:49.000]  They're big on the climate change
[3:53:49.000 --> 3:53:51.000]  Agenda
[3:53:51.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  Not because they believe it
[3:53:53.000 --> 3:53:55.000]  But because it's a Trojan horse way
[3:53:55.000 --> 3:53:57.000]  Of gaining that command
[3:53:57.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  And control system
[3:53:59.000 --> 3:54:01.000]  So take a look, this is the line
[3:54:01.000 --> 3:54:03.000]  Being built in Saudi Arabia
[3:54:03.000 --> 3:54:05.000]  In the middle of nowhere in deserts
[3:54:05.000 --> 3:54:07.000]  And again they always show you like that
[3:54:07.000 --> 3:54:09.000]  Oh, we're taking this place
[3:54:09.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  Where no one's living
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:13.000]  This destitute place
[3:54:13.000 --> 3:54:15.000]  And we're going to make it vibrant with life
[3:54:15.000 --> 3:54:17.000]  No, they don't want you living
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:19.000]  With nature
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  They don't want you a part of that system
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:23.000]  They want you a part of theirs
[3:54:23.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  Here it is
[3:54:25.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  The wonder of more time
[3:54:27.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  To do what you love
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:31.000]  Oh yes
[3:54:31.000 --> 3:54:33.000]  With family and friends
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:35.000]  They're anti-family
[3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  Where you can access everything
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:39.000]  Within just five minutes
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  Just go into our slave grid system
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  And you can travel to the end
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:45.000]  In 20 minutes
[3:54:45.000 --> 3:54:47.000]  Maglev trains
[3:54:47.000 --> 3:54:49.000]  Have now been around
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  For decades and utilized throughout parts of the world
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  If we wanted to empower people
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:55.000]  In this country
[3:54:55.000 --> 3:54:57.000]  Why?
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  I ask you why have we not built a system
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:01.000]  Much like Eisenhower did
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  Who actually did some good things for us
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:05.000]  Other than warning us
[3:55:05.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  About the military industrial complex
[3:55:07.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  Other than warning us about the scientific
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  Elite and their attempts
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  To take over
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.000]  Policy which we saw
[3:55:15.000 --> 3:55:17.000]  During the COVID-1984
[3:55:17.000 --> 3:55:19.000]  Nightmare
[3:55:19.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  Other than telling you this was a spiritual battle
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  In warfare, he built the highway system
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  Can you imagine
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:27.000]  If we had a maglev train system
[3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  In the United States
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  You could literally
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:33.000]  Live on the east coast
[3:55:33.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  In a short drive
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  Away from an urban
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:39.000]  Center or city
[3:55:39.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  Get on that train, have a job in the
