[00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.369]  What it is now is not good.
[00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:03.630]  What it is now is assault on women's sports.
[00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:19.113]  I think it's also probably terrible for the whole trans movement, because it makes people more cynical about what the positive aspects of it are, and it makes people more, you know, less likely to accept it.
[00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:25.575]  Because they think of, now they think of trans people and trans rights, and they connect it to this athletic thing.
[00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:26.415]  That's a great point, yeah.
[00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:27.595]  Yeah.
[00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:32.459]  It's probably making people more distrustful, or more upset, or less accepting.
[00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:37.143]  Why is telling the truth now an assault on, quote, trans people?
[00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:37.863]  It's not.
[00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:40.085]  The assault is on women's sports.
[00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:46.085]   The assault is an attempted corporate takeover of the biological mechanisms of humans.
[00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:57.684]   And welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.044]  We're going to go back to the live transmission here in a moment.
[00:01:01.104 --> 00:01:03.607]  All the latest breaking news and information.
[00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:10.895]  But first, I wanted to salute my old friend Joe Rogan for standing up against the transhumanist mafia.
[00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:19.879]  That is using the whole transgender movement as its pretext to destroy the two genders and set up their scientific dictatorship.
[00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:29.223]  And I always preface this with no hatred towards adults who have chosen to change their bodies or do something they have free will and that is their body do with as they wish.
[00:01:29.803 --> 00:01:31.544]  But we shouldn't have to pay for it.
[00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:35.521]  And we shouldn't have our children targeted with it.
[00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:36.481]  Alright?
[00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:40.585]  If you want to have your genitals removed, that is your business.
[00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:43.467]  Just don't try to brainwash children into doing it.
[00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:55.297]  So Joe has come out and stirred new controversy by saying that trans NCAA champ swimmer Leah Thomas is an assault on women's sports.
[00:01:56.258 --> 00:02:02.986]  And all the usual suspects are demonizing him for simply calling out the fact that the Emperor is wearing no gloves.
[00:02:03.655 --> 00:02:03.815]  Yeah.
[00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:04.936]  What it is now is not good.
[00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:07.197]  What it is now is assault on women's sports.
[00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:16.223]  And the idea that anybody would think it's fair that someone who was number 462 as a man, 462 in the nation, is number one as a woman a year later.
[00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:16.584]  Yeah.
[00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:17.324]  And that's fair.
[00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:21.187]  You don't think maybe it was her passion for swimming that got her to number one?
[00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:21.587]  Could be.
[00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:22.348]  She's an amazing woman.
[00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:23.168]  Or a change in diet?
[00:02:23.448 --> 00:02:23.829]  Could be.
[00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:24.389]  Could be that.
[00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.829]  Could be.
[00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:25.109]  Yeah.
[00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.750]  Maybe just becoming her true self.
[00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:28.932]  I can't think of any other factor it could be.
[00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:31.233]  I'm just going passion for swimming.
[00:02:31.814 --> 00:02:32.114]  Maybe.
[00:02:32.354 --> 00:02:32.875]  You're probably right.
[00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:38.742]  But that might be the woke straw that breaks society's camel back.
[00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.425]  You're starting to see a lot of those now.
[00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:48.597]  Women are so frustrated, or parents, if your daughter is competing and they're competing against a trans woman.
[00:02:48.857 --> 00:02:49.737]  It's not fair.
[00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:50.878]  It's just not fair.
[00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:51.919]  No matter what anybody says.
[00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.660]  There's this nonsense idea of like, well, there's outliers and all.
[00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:58.262]  There's outliers and then there's biological males.
[00:02:58.382 --> 00:02:58.622]  Right.
[00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:00.143]  That's beyond outliers.
[00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:01.103]  There's always exceptions.
[00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:07.566]  The ancient Greeks used to say there's no rule without an exception, but you can't define what it is based on the exceptions.
[00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:20.393]   Well, it's interesting because in all other aspects of society, it's pretty much A given that, you know, a person can become trans and change their name and we're all pretty accepting of it.
[00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:24.235]  Where people have the most pushback is in sports.
[00:03:24.456 --> 00:03:24.656]  Right.
[00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:25.756]  Athletic competition.
[00:03:25.836 --> 00:03:27.397]  That's where the real pushback is.
[00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:29.578]  Where people are like, hey, the fuck.
[00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:30.079]  Right.
[00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.159]  This is not fair.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.860]  This is clearly not fair.
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.702]  There's a reason why we have a distinction between men and women's sports.
[00:03:35.942 --> 00:04:01.421]   And it's ironic because the people on that side usually always champion equality and nobody having an advantage and you know the people who are maybe disenfranchised or less capable should have an equal opportunity and by throwing someone like Leah Thomas In there, you're kind of, that's the opposite of that.
[00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:16.550]  I think it's also probably terrible for the whole trans movement because it makes people more cynical about what the positive aspects of it are, and it makes people more, you know, less likely to accept it.
[00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:22.994]  Because they think of, now they think of trans people and trans rights, and they connect it to this athletic thing.
[00:04:23.054 --> 00:04:23.935]  That's a great point, yeah.
[00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:25.015]  Yeah.
[00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:29.899]  It's probably making people more distrustful, or more upset, or less accepting.
[00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.583]  Why is telling the truth now an assault on, quote, trans people?
[00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:35.303]  It's not.
[00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:37.545]  The assault is on women's sports.
[00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:43.610]  The assault is an attempted corporate takeover of the biological mechanisms of humans.
[00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.512]  That's their stated goal.
[00:04:46.172 --> 00:04:53.798]  They want to not just turn all the crops into GMO systems that can't reproduce without laboratory conditions.
[00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.419]  with their Terminator genes, they want to do it with humans.
[00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.919]  That's the admitted Holy Grail.
[00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.419]   And if you go listen to Klaus Schwab or Harari or all these other globalists,
[00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.919]   they're saying the end of humans is now, the post-human world is here,
[00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.419]  your free will is over.
[00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.919]   So far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go,
[00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.919]  who we meet, what movies we watch.
[00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.479]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:43.125]  The whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:47.547]  We have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.
[00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:55.290]  New surveillance technologies that are now deployed just to deal with this coronavirus outbreak.
[00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:02.873]  When it's over, some governments may say, yes, but there is a second wave of corona coming, so we have to be prepared.
[00:06:03.213 --> 00:06:05.634]  And there is Ebola, and there is also regular flu.
[00:06:06.014 --> 00:06:09.576]  Why not protect people against that too with this new surveillance system?
[00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:19.471]   it indefinitely. Also, it's the moment when surveillance goes really under the skin. Governments
[00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:25.930]   are now not just interested in where we go and who we meet, but even in what's happening
[00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.550]  inside our bodies.
[00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.189]   You see, this is a declaration of war against humanity. And the Tabastock Institute and
[00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:37.230]   all the big tech companies that are pushing transgenderism admit that once you accept
[00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:42.271]   a man being a woman and a woman being a man, you'll accept babies being grown in pods,
[00:06:42.271 --> 00:06:46.509]   you'll accept human-animal hybrids, you'll accept humanoid clones that aren't really
[00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:47.189]  human, but...
[00:06:47.828 --> 00:06:50.790]  Don't have rights, but are indistinguishable from humans.
[00:06:51.551 --> 00:06:52.992]  This is the future.
[00:06:53.532 --> 00:07:03.039]  This is how, in the name of civil rights, the globalists are bringing in a system that takes all of our rights away and turns us into a big corporate commodity.
[00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.262]  Alright, I'm going to hand the baton back to the crew and the great live transmission in Austin, Texas.
[00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:14.687]  I just want to remind everybody that InfoWars is literally the front line of fighting for humanity.
[00:07:16.007 --> 00:07:24.496]  Infowars is the heart of the brain trust that understands the enemy's operations, and that means you're at the very heart of that as well.
[00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:32.003]  So that's why I always want to take out time to thank you all, and to ask you to pray for us, and to ask you to spread the articles and videos like never before.
[00:07:33.164 --> 00:07:37.127]  And to ask you to go to infowarrestore.com and to support the broadcast.
[00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:38.348]  We are in the thick of the fight.
[00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:41.830]  We've never been under so much attack because we've never been so effective.
[00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.151]  Three things I want to tell you about.
[00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:47.934]  All the t-shirts and apparel and flags and everything is being sold at cost.
[00:07:48.415 --> 00:07:49.335]  Total blowout sale.
[00:07:49.776 --> 00:07:53.058]  None of these designs that we've made over 20 plus years will ever come back.
[00:07:53.198 --> 00:07:55.800]  They're all limited edition now because it's all ending.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.901]  We got to get the funds in.
[00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.283]  We may still have some t-shirts in the future, but they'll be limited edition as well.
[00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:01.804]  Only three or four designs at a time.
[00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:04.346]  So all the old designs are gone.
[00:08:04.366 --> 00:08:06.488]  You want to get them now and support the InfoWar?
[00:08:06.548 --> 00:08:07.149]  Here's your chance.
[00:08:07.489 --> 00:08:08.470]  InfoWarStore.com.

[00:08:12.052 --> 00:08:12.653]  All-natural.
[00:08:12.673 --> 00:08:13.493]  Works really great.
[00:08:13.553 --> 00:08:14.094]  People love it.
[00:08:14.234 --> 00:08:15.175]  It's back in stock.
[00:08:15.195 --> 00:08:15.995]  Sold out for a year.
[00:08:16.015 --> 00:08:17.356]  It's 40% off.
[00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:22.641]  And we've only got through the weekend to get Vazzo Beets and Bio-True Selenium for 40% off that sale.
[00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.042]  It's going to be ending in three or four days.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.005]  And then on top of that, we will sell out at current sales rates of a 1776 coin by Friday or Saturday.
[00:08:32.326 --> 00:08:34.987]  It's part two and a three part series.
[00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:40.852]  1776coin.com or InfoWarsTore.com and follow that link to PatriotCollectibles.com.
[00:08:41.192 --> 00:08:46.736]  You can find those and the markup in the coin, funds keeping us on the air and everybody that gives us their email.
[00:08:47.097 --> 00:08:51.180]  We'll be a founding member if we're able to stay on air and launch some new stuff, which we probably will.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:53.601]  We're going to try our hardest, but we need the funds.
[00:08:54.802 --> 00:08:58.386]  You'll be part of something really special being a founding member, so don't miss out on this.
[00:08:58.406 --> 00:08:59.887]  There's only three coins in the series.
[00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:01.789]  We're about to sell out of the second coin in the series.
[00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.271]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:10.091]   or 888-253-3139. Thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:25.211]   I need to fund our operation so I try to sell you products that you enjoy, that empower
[00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:28.890]   you, that enrich you, that really work so you come back and buy more.
[00:09:28.932 --> 00:09:34.257]  We have a symbiotic relationship and there's been major supply chain breakdowns as you know the last few years.
[00:09:34.598 --> 00:09:41.004]  That's why so many products we've had to either discontinue them or reformulate them or just wait and wait and wait for them to come in.
[00:09:42.285 --> 00:09:45.127]  It was 11 months ago we put our deposit down.
[00:09:46.192 --> 00:10:01.222]  To the US company that has a deal with France to get the patented special quail eggs that are fed a secret diet that in major even trials and studies have been proven to work better than over-the-counter antihistamines, but in a natural way.
[00:10:01.422 --> 00:10:06.526]  And finally, 11 months after I put down the money to get it, we were about to discontinue it and demand our money back.
[00:10:06.826 --> 00:10:11.147]  Came in, pollen block, packaged here in the U.S., specially fed quail in France.
[00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:12.547]  I discovered this 100 years ago.
[00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:15.128]  They were being fed a certain diet and people ate those eggs.
[00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:16.508]  The French eat a lot of quail eggs.
[00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:17.488]  A lot of people in Texas do it.
[00:10:17.528 --> 00:10:19.149]  But the point is that you wouldn't get allergies.
[00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:22.249]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's from the quail egg shell, I should add.
[00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:24.930]  Well, it's back in stock, 40% off.
[00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.290]  And who knows, this could be the only time it's ever available again.
[00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.431]  You know, they're bringing lockdowns and shutdowns back.
[00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:30.951]  But we finally got it back in.
[00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:33.132]  Very proprietary, very, very special.
[00:10:33.212 --> 00:10:33.753]  It's available.
[00:10:33.773 --> 00:10:38.956]  You can sign up for auto-ship, additional 10% off, and we'll hold some back for your next order, so you are sure to get it.
[00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.817]  But we're ready to ship it to you right now, back in stock.
[00:10:40.937 --> 00:10:45.520]  PollenBlock at InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-33139.

[00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:55.547]  Quail Egg Concentrate.
[00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:59.089]  It's just pure quail egg concentrate at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:03.576]  We're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[00:11:04.016 --> 00:11:05.699]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:11:06.039 --> 00:11:09.505]  This is The War Room with Owen Schroeder.
[00:11:09.765 --> 00:11:13.872]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
