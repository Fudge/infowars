[00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:17.752]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:18.953]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.953 --> 00:00:19.293]  Today.
[00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:46.190]  Thursday, November 10th, 2022.
[00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.398]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:54.398 --> 00:00:57.922]  We've got a very important broadcast.
[00:00:57.922 --> 00:01:01.626]  We're launching as we speak.
[00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:03.968]  We have primary ignition.
[00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:05.289]  We'll be here until 3 p.m.
[00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.610]  Central.
[00:01:07.446 --> 00:01:16.928]  Owen Schroeder has been doing an excellent job breaking down the fraud and also tracking the battleground races that are still ongoing.
[00:01:16.928 --> 00:01:23.350]  He will be in the studio simultaneously with us in 30 minutes.
[00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.372]  Mike Lindell has assembled quite the team and in live time in the last few days has been documenting what can only be described as in-your-face fraud.
[00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:50.753]  That's all coming up and more and we will also open the phones up and take your calls today.
[00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:53.614]  And I want to cover all the news and I want to get into all the different facets of it.
[00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:55.555]  We're going to.
[00:01:55.555 --> 00:02:05.599]  But I also want to just talk big picture here about what we're what we're living through, what's happening and the paradox that's there.
[00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:33.988]  If the globalists tell us they want to depopulate us because we're worthless scum in their eyes, useless eaters is the technical term they use, a human scourge that needs to be culled, an infestation, a disease, and they're self-appointed to carry that out, if we don't rally to our own human cause,
[00:02:35.376 --> 00:02:39.919]  And not let the worst people on earth take control of our destiny.
[00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:45.301]  As adults, we do deserve to die.
[00:02:45.301 --> 00:03:01.470]  And there's a very distant point for those that believe in humanity and believe in free will and believe in human empowerment and those that don't believe in human free will and human empowerment for the average person and want to be God.
[00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.291]  We're very far apart.
[00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:19.828]  Except in the area of being aware of how the universe works.
[00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:34.921]  And it really is true in a social Darwinistic fashion that is we present all this that's very accurate and documented and the general public does not rally and awaken and say no and bring the perpetrators of justice
[00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:40.702]  That really they've all been given ample warning and deserve what they get.
[00:03:40.702 --> 00:04:02.936]  And that's why the globalists target adults with deadly shots and assisted suicide and all the rest of it because metaphysically in the natural law of the universe, if you can get somebody to hurt themselves out of their free will, even if you pretty much trick them, you still got to give them a hint, then it doesn't come back on you metaphysically as bad.
[00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:08.499]  So they're definitely involved in a spiritual alchemy, and they understand the laws of the universe.
[00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:25.772]  But when they cross the Rubicon of trying to euthanize children, trying to sterilize children, trying to wreck the brains of children, it commits an interdimensional crime that God will not put up with and will destroy us.
[00:04:27.427 --> 00:04:47.793]  And the other team we're fighting knows that, and that's why they try to get us to go along and sanction the killing of children, whether it be abortion, or assisted suicide, or transgenderism as a form of genetic suicide for the people that actually get sterilized.
[00:04:47.793 --> 00:04:52.975]  And so, they're trying to get us to lower our shields.
[00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:53.535]  Ourselves.
[00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:56.356]  So they can really have their way with us.
[00:04:56.356 --> 00:05:00.923]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:18.345]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:31.097]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[00:05:31.778 --> 00:05:32.358]  We're good to go.
[00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:21.467]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.467 --> 00:06:30.554]  We know from scientific exit polls around the country that even CNN predicted an absolute total bloodbath
[00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:41.643]  The Democrats, but magically, despite there was much higher Republican turnout than Democrats, they have effectively blocked.
[00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.380]  The red tsunami.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:51.426]  And Joe Biden's been stumbling around on a disgusting celebratory victory lap, spewing lies.
[00:06:51.426 --> 00:07:01.315]  Depending on the poll, between 70 and 87 percent of Americans blame Joe Biden and the Democrats for inflation and the country collapsing and were saying they were going to vote Republican.
[00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:09.022]  But it just didn't happen because the machines in all the key districts, in all the key states, just magically went out in the key Republican districts.
[00:07:09.582 --> 00:07:16.768]  And then their ballots had to get sent off to a central special place to be counted.
[00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:24.554]  And all the same, handing out the black sharpies in Republican districts so those votes wouldn't be counted, just done all over the damn country.
[00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:27.716]  We got Mike Lindell joining us in the second hour.
[00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:29.278]  He's always done a great job fighting, but he's...
[00:07:30.697 --> 00:07:33.799]  Knocks it out of the park this time with the analysis and more.
[00:07:33.799 --> 00:07:35.420]  Hell, we should get Pete Santilli on.
[00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.222]  I was watching them yesterday and today.
[00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:39.283]  A lot of their stuff up on Infowars.com.
[00:07:39.283 --> 00:07:41.625]  Doing a great job laying all this out.
[00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:50.471]  Owen Troyer joins us at the bottom of the hour to look at the aftermath, the fraud evidence, and then the battleground states of Nevada, Arizona, and Georgia, and Colorado.
[00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:54.454]  There's a lot of ongoing races that we're going to be looking at very, very closely.
[00:07:55.054 --> 00:08:04.640]  I also want to take a lot of calls today and pull back and look at the big picture, what we're really dealing with here, and how this is the same formula of control all over the world where voting is still allowed.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.782]  But let's just, let's play a few of these clips.
[00:08:07.782 --> 00:08:22.991]  Here's Biden saying the overwhelming majority of American people support his economic agenda, though every poll, even New York Times polls, even polls the Democrats have commissioned, show absolute disgust.
[00:08:24.045 --> 00:08:26.767]  He says you love it and you just voted for more of it.
[00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:27.127]  Here it is.
[00:08:27.127 --> 00:08:30.590]  I don't know how to read them anymore.
[00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.692]  I hope you are uncertain as well.
[00:08:33.692 --> 00:08:39.697]  But the overwhelming majority of the American people support the elements of my economic agenda.
[00:08:39.697 --> 00:08:53.187]  From rebuilding America's roads and bridges, to lowering prescription drug costs, to historic investment in tackling the climate crisis, to making sure that large corporations begin to pay their fair share in tax.
[00:08:55.219 --> 00:08:57.960]  Biden just goes on and on and on.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.941]  There's so many of these clips.
[00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:13.827]  Also, there's a really important clip I want to play here in a moment, but I'm going to play it right now, of a reporter sycophantically, like she's a commissar in Soviet Russia, or a Maoist under Mao in China.
[00:09:13.827 --> 00:09:19.550]  And she's like, oh, is Musk a national security problem?
[00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:20.770]  Are you going to investigate him?
[00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:22.791]  Should he be looked into buying Twitter?
[00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:24.492]  You know, maybe he's a Ruski, too.
[00:09:26.503 --> 00:09:34.847]  And Biden very creepily starts smacking his lips and saying, yes, we should look into it.
[00:09:34.847 --> 00:09:37.328]  Here it is.
[00:09:37.328 --> 00:09:38.428]  Is this threat to U.S.
[00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:41.550]  national security and should the U.S.
[00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:54.396]  and with the tools you have investigate his joint acquisition of Twitter with foreign governments, which include the Saudis?
[00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:55.196]  I think that
[00:09:57.677 --> 00:10:17.512]  Elon Musk's cooperation and or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at.
[00:10:18.777 --> 00:10:23.899]  Whether or not he is doing anything inappropriate, I'm not suggesting that.
[00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.260]  I'm suggesting that it's worse being looked at.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:35.103]  But that's all I'll say.
[00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:45.066]  Now, I want to go to a clip here of the president of El Salvador visiting Tucker Carlson.
[00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:52.766]  Talking about looking at what's happening to America and coming to the conclusion that this is all being done by design.
[00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:56.868]  Well, the globalists say they're destroying the country by design.
[00:10:56.868 --> 00:11:00.110]  They're shutting down the pipelines, the coal power plants, the borders.
[00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:01.410]  They're just annihilating us.
[00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.011]  And it's all a big joke to them.
[00:11:03.011 --> 00:11:06.633]  I mean, they have Jimmy Kimmel making jokes about fentanyl deaths.
[00:11:06.633 --> 00:11:11.016]  This is a pro-death, pro-tyranny cult.
[00:11:11.016 --> 00:11:14.518]  And then, speaking of Biden, there's a clip of him being asked about Hunter Biden.
[00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:18.330]  By a non-sycophantic reporter.
[00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.371]  And he just laughs at it.
[00:11:19.371 --> 00:11:22.733]  He says, good luck, because he knows he controls the Justice Department.
[00:11:22.733 --> 00:11:26.556]  Or his boss is, like Obama and others above him do.
[00:11:26.556 --> 00:11:31.359]  And so these are arrogant, entitled criminals who just stole another election.
[00:11:31.359 --> 00:11:33.900]  All they do is lie.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.701]  On every issue.
[00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:35.461]  On the economy.
[00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:36.602]  On COVID.
[00:11:36.602 --> 00:11:37.402]  On the borders.
[00:11:37.402 --> 00:11:39.184]  Just all of it.
[00:11:39.184 --> 00:11:40.725]  On Ukraine.
[00:11:40.725 --> 00:11:44.307]  But before we go to that clip, here is the President of El Salvador.
[00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:49.764]  Naeem Bukele-Ortiz.
[00:11:49.764 --> 00:11:51.625]  Here he is with Tucker Carlson.
[00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:54.226]  And the term he uses is the name of my first film.
[00:11:54.226 --> 00:12:03.672]  I was trying to make a documentary about the UN, world government takeover, and the plan to destroy society, the family, our culture, have forced medical tyranny, forced injections.
[00:12:03.672 --> 00:12:05.673]  It's all in my first film.
[00:12:05.673 --> 00:12:06.914]  Two hours long.
[00:12:06.914 --> 00:12:09.176]  America Destroyed by Design.
[00:12:09.176 --> 00:12:10.156]  It's still free online.
[00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:11.597]  You can still find it.
[00:12:11.597 --> 00:12:15.500]  And it's titled America Destroyed by Design.
[00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:19.366]  And here he is using that term.
[00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:20.566]  The demise of the U.S.
[00:12:20.566 --> 00:12:22.987]  has to come from within.
[00:12:22.987 --> 00:12:25.348]  The enemies have to be inside.
[00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:26.609]  Not really outside.
[00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:32.551]  No external enemy can cause so much damage as internal.
[00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:35.111]  As an internal operation.
[00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:37.072]  You're watching internal operations here.
[00:12:37.072 --> 00:12:39.333]  You can see them in cities.
[00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:44.835]  Cities that were pristinely beautiful 30 years ago are wastelands.
[00:12:45.714 --> 00:12:58.283]  Right now, you will see people, I mean, I'm from El Salvador, third world country in Central America, and myself, I can see cities here and say, I don't want to, I want to live here.
[00:12:58.283 --> 00:13:02.226]  So that would be unthinkable two decades ago.
[00:13:02.226 --> 00:13:03.107]  Totally unthinkable.
[00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.733]  But a Salvadoran wouldn't want to live in a US city?
[00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:08.113]  In a US main city?
[00:13:08.113 --> 00:13:11.955]  I mean, Los Angeles, San Francisco... New York, Chicago, yeah.
[00:13:11.955 --> 00:13:26.323]  Well, Philadelphia, Baltimore... When you look at how the cities are eroding so fast, this has to be by design.
[00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:31.786]  I mean, who would make so many stupid decisions?
[00:13:31.786 --> 00:13:32.947]  Like, okay, we're gonna...
[00:13:33.885 --> 00:13:35.626]  We're going to give you money for drugs.
[00:13:35.626 --> 00:13:37.046]  Really, they're doing that.
[00:13:37.046 --> 00:13:39.808]  In some cities, they're giving people drugs.
[00:13:39.808 --> 00:13:43.069]  I mean, they're literally giving people drugs in some U.S.
[00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:45.330]  cities.
[00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.892]  Or they say, OK, we're going to give you money if you don't work.
[00:13:49.892 --> 00:13:55.835]  Or, we're going to, you know, they make all of these laws that make no sense.
[00:13:55.835 --> 00:13:58.416]  Or if they have a high crime, OK, I have a solution.
[00:13:58.416 --> 00:13:59.437]  Let's defund the police.
[00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.990]  Right?
[00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.012]  They make this analysis here.
[00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:17.438]  And you see all these campaigns, defund the police, you'll see these campaigns of, you know, let's allow shoplifting up to this amount.
[00:14:17.438 --> 00:14:20.760]  They make these decisions openly.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.200]  I mean, it's not even secret.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.262]  They make them openly.
[00:14:26.262 --> 00:14:29.544]  And we all know what will be the consequence of it.
[00:14:31.243 --> 00:14:35.555]  Which is the takedown and the total collapse of the western world, which is their admitted plan.
[00:14:36.806 --> 00:14:39.488]  The government is not run by us in most areas.
[00:14:39.488 --> 00:14:41.489]  It's at war with us.
[00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:51.334]  And you can cross from one town to another, Republican run to Democrat run, and you leave a clean, nice, healthy place, and you enter a hellhole by design.
[00:14:51.334 --> 00:14:52.455]  In fact, there's examples of this.
[00:14:52.455 --> 00:15:00.059]  I meant to send some of our reporters up to cover because I was up visiting some friends in Round Rock, in Williamson County, last week.
[00:15:02.682 --> 00:15:14.089]  As you drive under the bridge, there's the county line for Travis County and Williamson County, and there's all the homelessness and garbage and crime and crack dealers right here, and you cross right on the line, it's all clean.
[00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:19.011]  Because the police don't have their hands tied.
[00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:25.235]  And, again, it's the cloud and pivot strategy, America destroyed by design.
[00:15:27.296 --> 00:15:33.040]  And the longer this goes, the worse it's going to get until things completely collapse.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.084]  Then, they're going to roll out the national ID cards, the implantable chips, it's all been announced.
[00:15:39.084 --> 00:15:42.927]  And you're going to have to do everything they say, or they're going to put you in a death camp.
[00:15:42.927 --> 00:15:46.650]  Now when the party's over, folks, there'll be no more getting free stuff, none of that.
[00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:55.636]  It's going to be high-tech compact cities, death camps, combat robots, and they're just going to snap their fingers and turn the 5G on, and you'll all start dying of cancer within months.

[00:17:06.181 --> 00:17:19.289]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the globalists and their censorship and tyranny.

[00:19:21.249 --> 00:19:25.694]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[00:19:25.694 --> 00:19:26.975]  And I need your support.
[00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:34.603]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.

[00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:52.215]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[00:20:01.167 --> 00:20:05.771]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:16.078]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:16.078 --> 00:20:24.284]  Now I want listeners that are tuning in to the Alex Jones Show to understand something.
[00:20:24.284 --> 00:20:27.687]  When I talk about things on air, I'm deadly, deadly serious about it.
[00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:44.681]  So we just went to break and I said this is what's going to happen if they execute the next phase of their plan and they're going to start turning 5G on and people that live close to it are going to die in a matter of months from cancer.
[00:20:44.681 --> 00:20:50.184]  We actually have the studies.
[00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.205]  Okay?
[00:20:51.205 --> 00:20:57.928]  Going back with the other previous forms being used for quote communications and what's important to understand is
[00:20:59.582 --> 00:21:03.323]  All of these platforms are multi-use.
[00:21:03.323 --> 00:21:14.468]  You can modulate 5G and these other systems, and they're good for communications, and they still have major cancer-causing effects.
[00:21:14.468 --> 00:21:16.328]  That is an admitted fact.
[00:21:16.328 --> 00:21:17.809]  We've interviewed countless engineers.
[00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.429]  It's in all the major studies.
[00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:21.750]  You can pull up Wired Magazine five years ago.
[00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.931]  Big studies.
[00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:25.772]  5G does cause even more cancer than the previous
[00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.171]  Generations of it.
[00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:38.936]  And now the Chai comms are having 6th and 7th G coming out to run the robot cars, to control the robots on record, to track everything you do.
[00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:57.345]  They can also then modulate them differently, and it's a pre-programmed system, centralized, where they can have even higher rates of medical problems, deoxidation in the lungs, burning of the skin.
[00:21:59.229 --> 00:22:06.051]  Just because you can't see the waves coming off, doesn't mean they're not there.
[00:22:06.051 --> 00:22:06.632]  They are.
[00:22:06.632 --> 00:22:07.652]  And we all know this.
[00:22:07.652 --> 00:22:24.378]  So, when I talk about these issues of incrementally hitting you from dozens of different angles with different soft kill weapons, show that there's lots of different symptoms, lots of different illnesses, lots of different forms of death, but the life expectancy everywhere these systems go in is plunging.
[00:22:26.052 --> 00:22:35.718]  The IQs are plunging, the cognitive ability is plunging, the neurological disorders are exploding, and the heart problems and cardiovascular problems.
[00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:39.561]  You see, the body's electrochemical.
[00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:43.083]  All your nerves, all your cells are electrochemical.
[00:22:43.083 --> 00:22:51.689]  But the heart particularly and the brain are extremely electrochemical.
[00:22:51.689 --> 00:22:55.712]  The heart is like a big powered battery full of nerves.
[00:22:57.717 --> 00:23:04.101]  And there's study after study that these electromagnetic waves jack with your heart.
[00:23:04.101 --> 00:23:13.868]  And in studies with mice, they can change the oscillations that aren't as good for communication, but that will fry you even faster.
[00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:18.851]  So when I'm talking about this, you have to understand, this kill grid's going in.
[00:23:18.851 --> 00:23:26.637]  They didn't just hit us with the COVID-19 out of the lab and then roll out a deadly shot that
[00:23:27.861 --> 00:23:37.027]  Whether it's the virus vector injections of J&J and AstraZeneca, or whether it's the mRNA gene therapy of Pfizer and Moderna.
[00:23:37.027 --> 00:23:41.050]  By the way, it's the exact same shot, it's just Moderna's three times stronger.
[00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:45.613]  It's all the Defense Department made, then they cheap-dipped it out in China to claim that's where it came from.
[00:23:45.613 --> 00:23:47.974]  It's all come out.
[00:23:47.974 --> 00:23:54.379]  Did two hours with Dr. Peter McCullough on it last Saturday.
[00:23:54.379 --> 00:23:55.459]  They are then able
[00:23:56.792 --> 00:24:11.078]  To test and gauge the public and see if you wake up and see if you get upset and see if they can normalize a 40 plus percent death rate in every Western country previous to any other year.
[00:24:11.078 --> 00:24:13.419]  Not COVID related.
[00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:18.702]  They're testing to see if you wake up, if you get organized, if you say no.
[00:24:18.702 --> 00:24:26.005]  And if you don't notice what's happening to you in the stunned condition you're in, then they up it even more.
[00:24:28.018 --> 00:24:29.399]  And they see us as a human scourge.
[00:24:29.399 --> 00:24:32.020]  And let me explain why the globalists are so confident.
[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:43.226]  We just played a clip of the very populous patriot president of El Salvador, with Tucker Carlson, saying this is America being destroyed by design.
[00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:44.367]  Now how does he know that?
[00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:52.251]  Well, if you look at Latin America, until the 1960s, until the IMF and World Bank funded leftist revolutions down there,
[00:24:55.259 --> 00:25:01.261]  Half of the countries in Latin America had a standard of living close to the U.S.
[00:25:01.261 --> 00:25:09.624]  Another 20 or so percent were on par, and about 30% of Latin America had a higher standard of living than we do.
[00:25:09.624 --> 00:25:14.326]  Beautiful cities, beautiful farms in rural areas, very low crime.
[00:25:14.326 --> 00:25:19.708]  But culturally, they had the same thing done to them that's been done to us.
[00:25:21.977 --> 00:25:25.260]  And it was easy because people moved off the farms the last hundred years.
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:30.504]  They had kids, they had kids, and people also got disconnected from reality and got decadent.
[00:25:30.504 --> 00:25:39.631]  So that allowed the globals to come in and inflate their currencies and create the social systems that produce this poison.
[00:25:39.631 --> 00:25:44.896]  So when you look at the IMF and World Bank, they're just front groups for large private central banks, but also on the private Federal Reserve.
[00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:56.220]  And you see them with Build Back Better and collapsing our economy and shipping in drugs and all of this, you think, man, that's crazy to do that and giving us poison shots.
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:08.369]  You got to understand that in Central Asia and Southeast Asia and all of the Pacific and all over Africa particularly and all over poor areas of Eastern Europe and all over Latin America,
[00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:14.413]  And in Native American reservations here in the U.S.
[00:26:14.413 --> 00:26:28.123]  and Canada, it's a big scandal in Canada, since the 30s they've been giving indigenous populations so-called vaccines that had cancer viruses in them, they had that since the 40s, and sterilant hormones to cause an autoimmune response.
[00:26:28.863 --> 00:26:33.184]  Since the 60s, and there's official UN programs admitting they did this.
[00:26:33.184 --> 00:26:49.690]  So they've already tested it in other countries, cutting off resources, starting civil wars, poisoning people, doing all this, and now they're taking everything they've learned, this is important, to the Western world.
[00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:55.892]  Because the Western world is only about 15% of the world population.
[00:26:55.892 --> 00:26:56.892]  Some numbers are about 13.
[00:27:00.465 --> 00:27:02.826]  You can count China quasi-industrial.
[00:27:02.826 --> 00:27:04.827]  Now you're talking about 35% of the world population.
[00:27:04.827 --> 00:27:09.949]  But the West is less than 15%.
[00:27:09.949 --> 00:27:13.490]  And the globalists say people have air conditioning, they have cars.
[00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:18.992]  Remember Obama went to Africa right before he left office seven years ago and said you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:27:18.992 --> 00:27:20.453]  Went to Latin America and told them that in speeches.
[00:27:20.453 --> 00:27:21.133]  We played it many times.
[00:27:22.128 --> 00:27:25.110]  Well, they look at the West, and the globalists see us as using their resources.
[00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.632]  They own us, they believe.
[00:27:26.632 --> 00:27:28.073]  They've taken control through fraud.
[00:27:28.073 --> 00:27:32.356]  And they say, well, we've already been attacking the third world for a long time.
[00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:42.144]  Now it's time to make sure no one has anywhere to run, and there's no example of freedom and liberty and upper mobility and consumerism that they've used to control us.
[00:27:42.144 --> 00:27:48.770]  But just the idea of consumerism, your ability to buy and go and travel and do what you want, your lifestyle.
[00:27:49.923 --> 00:27:55.646]  There's authoritarian models coming in, so they have to get rid of the West so it's not an example to aspire to.
[00:27:55.646 --> 00:28:03.349]  So they've already gotten away with all this beta testing, mass murder and control in police states all over the world.
[00:28:03.349 --> 00:28:06.630]  China's their biggest project.
[00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:15.634]  Testing it for the rest of the world, they admit that at the Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group and the Club of Rome and all these other new old organizations like the WEF.
[00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:18.175]  It's all the same people, same organizations.
[00:28:18.175 --> 00:28:18.976]  So they have a really
[00:28:20.387 --> 00:28:20.687]  I don't know.
[00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.491]  This is the reality.
[00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:48.219]  They stated there's too many people, they say they want to kill you, and they then say, hey look, you're dumb, you don't care, we're going to kill you.
[00:28:48.219 --> 00:28:50.502]  I think Global is trying to get me to go over to their side.
[00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:53.105]  They say, Jones, you're not going to stop us, you should just join us.
[00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:55.208]  The public needs to go.
[00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:56.730]  Now do you really want to go, folks?
[00:29:03.325 --> 00:29:07.651]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:29:07.651 --> 00:29:18.866]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:31.564]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[00:29:31.564 --> 00:29:34.769]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are
[00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.092]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the Globalists as their number one enemy.
[00:30:05.652 --> 00:30:08.770]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[00:30:09.872 --> 00:30:14.774]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:30:14.774 --> 00:30:18.316]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:19.156]  It's game over.
[00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:24.859]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:29.461]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[00:30:29.461 --> 00:30:35.604]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.

[00:32:14.505 --> 00:32:16.568]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:23.749]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[00:32:23.749 --> 00:32:30.871]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:33.471]  Essential means without these things you die.
[00:32:33.471 --> 00:32:41.313]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:32:41.573 --> 00:32:48.477]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:07.049]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.758 --> 00:33:27.995]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:49.581 --> 00:33:55.665]  I know you tuned in to this Thursday broadcast to hear about the election and what's happening there.
[00:33:55.665 --> 00:33:59.527]  We're going to be covering most of the balance of the broadcast today.
[00:33:59.527 --> 00:34:10.214]  I just wanted to pull back and talk big picture here about why they're destroying not just America but every once-free nation of the world.
[00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:10.914]  And it's for total
[00:34:11.974 --> 00:34:25.518]  Absolute control so there's no independent pockets of wealth and so that no one is self-sufficient in any way when they release far more powerful bioweapons and electromagnetic weapons in the very near future.
[00:34:25.518 --> 00:34:37.221]  We are living under an organized nanotech biological warfare operation implanting the public with self-replicating
[00:34:38.413 --> 00:34:48.817]  Protein crystals, based on the spike protein, where your body manufactures a system to kill you.
[00:34:48.817 --> 00:34:54.799]  And it's mainstream news, sudden death syndrome, 40 plus percent death rate above any other rate bigger.
[00:34:54.799 --> 00:34:59.780]  We have higher death rates per capita than World War I and World War II, Vietnam combined.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.681]  They are killing us, and it's in all the countries that took the shots.
[00:35:02.681 --> 00:35:05.842]  It is a fact that they did this.
[00:35:05.842 --> 00:35:07.043]  It is a fact
[00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:10.441]  That if they're not brought to justice, they're going to do it more.
[00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:16.945]  It's a fact that the groups that say there's too many of us are running the operation.
[00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:23.951]  I'm done talking about that now, but later we've got more info on it, and we're also going to be up with the phones up.
[00:35:23.951 --> 00:35:27.333]  But this is a very, very serious time to be alive.
[00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:35.680]  Now, Owen Schroyer has done an excellent job with the rest of the team tracking the election,
[00:35:36.994 --> 00:35:42.397]  He's about to look at some of the evidence coming in amounting of fraud.
[00:35:42.397 --> 00:35:47.880]  Mike Lindell joins us next hour to get into bombshell information on that front.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:53.664]  But Owen's first going to look at the states where the fight is ongoing.
[00:35:55.956 --> 00:35:58.258]  Republicans destroy the Democrats in popular vote.
[00:35:58.258 --> 00:36:00.939]  The GOP margin of victory was more than 6% nationwide.
[00:36:00.939 --> 00:36:01.680]  Total of 95,786,183 votes.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.641]  50,103,444 Republican.
[00:36:02.641 --> 00:36:02.981]  44,243,277 Democrat.
[00:36:02.981 --> 00:36:06.763]  With Mike Lindell coming up, we're going to look at the official tally numbers coming in.
[00:36:06.763 --> 00:36:08.444]  Let's show every time Herschel Walker or Carrie Lake or
[00:36:25.798 --> 00:36:29.199]  Oz or anybody got in the lead at the exact point of the lead.
[00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:30.079]  Boom!
[00:36:30.079 --> 00:36:36.360]  A perfect straight line explosion putting them way over the lead.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:45.442]  But in one case in Pennsylvania they added more votes than even existed in those counties and districts and precincts and so they even brought it down but then back up.
[00:36:45.442 --> 00:36:46.222]  Unprecedented stuff.
[00:36:46.222 --> 00:36:48.522]  Mike Lindell is going to be covering that as well.
[00:36:48.522 --> 00:36:50.363]  We're going to be looking at everything on it.
[00:36:50.363 --> 00:36:51.563]  Owen Schroer, give us the latest.
[00:36:53.022 --> 00:36:56.325]  Ah, Alex, the old Vote Viagra for Raphael Warnock.
[00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:58.847]  Boy, that's a trick they love to use.
[00:36:58.847 --> 00:37:00.929]  The two states we're still watching.
[00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:02.130]  Nevada, Arizona.
[00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:03.171]  Let's start in Arizona.
[00:37:03.171 --> 00:37:07.375]  Now, what's going on in Maricopa County at this point is just ridiculous.
[00:37:07.375 --> 00:37:09.477]  That's the greater Phoenix area.
[00:37:09.477 --> 00:37:11.799]  Really, the entire state, it's ridiculous.
[00:37:11.799 --> 00:37:17.664]  But it's whatever the problems are in Maricopa County that we're going to be talking about and we're going to be watching very closely.
[00:37:18.365 --> 00:37:26.009]  The lead for Hobbs obviously in Maricopa County is where the big gap is, about 50,000.
[00:37:26.009 --> 00:37:32.393]  In the entire state, Lake is only behind by just under 15,000.
[00:37:32.393 --> 00:37:34.014]  Now the Lake campaign believes
[00:37:34.574 --> 00:37:41.975]  That the districts and the areas where the votes are still coming in are in the more conservative areas of Maricopa County.
[00:37:41.975 --> 00:37:44.416]  So we're talking about outside of the Phoenix area.
[00:37:44.416 --> 00:37:50.137]  And they do believe they're going to be getting 60% or even higher percentages of those votes.
[00:37:50.137 --> 00:37:52.877]  That's why they're still confident at the late campaign.
[00:37:52.877 --> 00:37:58.678]  Even the Masters campaign, who is a lot farther behind than the late campaign by about 100,000.
[00:37:58.678 --> 00:38:03.539]  If you guys want to switch to the Senate now, you'll see that that one is a lot bigger of a margin.
[00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:15.184]  For the Republicans to overcome, and in fact, I actually think that Kelly is probably going to end up keeping his seat there with Masters just barely coming up short.
[00:38:15.184 --> 00:38:19.326]  We'll talk about the issues, if people trust that or not, when we come to that point.
[00:38:19.326 --> 00:38:26.549]  But when you go back to the Governor's race, this is the amazing thing about what's going on right now in Arizona, specifically in this Governor's race.
[00:38:27.691 --> 00:38:39.219]  Everyone across the country, whether you're a Democrat or Republican or a Libertarian or whatever, has to admit what's going on in Maricopa County and what's going on in the state of Arizona has been an absolute disaster.
[00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:44.283]  How is it Florida does so well after a hurricane and Arizona can't figure out its stuff?
[00:38:44.283 --> 00:38:52.228]  How do entire countries do so well in a day of voting in person like France and Arizona can't figure their stuff out?
[00:38:52.228 --> 00:38:54.390]  What is going on in Arizona?
[00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:55.610]  So the late campaign
[00:38:56.698 --> 00:38:59.301]  Essentially, imagine if we had a re-election tomorrow.
[00:38:59.301 --> 00:39:03.726]  Imagine they say, oh the governor's race, too much shenanigans, we're going to have a re-race.
[00:39:03.726 --> 00:39:08.752]  Well now you go up and you say, do you think that Arizona's elections were held well?
[00:39:08.752 --> 00:39:11.435]  Do you think Arizona's elections did good in the midterms?
[00:39:11.435 --> 00:39:12.797]  And of course everybody's going to say no.
[00:39:12.797 --> 00:39:15.019]  And you're going to say, do you know who was running them?
[00:39:15.871 --> 00:39:17.513]  Katie Hobbs.
[00:39:17.513 --> 00:39:20.977]  Katie Hobbs is running the elections in the state of Arizona.
[00:39:20.977 --> 00:39:24.361]  Oh, and she just so happens to be on the ticket for governor.
[00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.984]  How convenient is that?
[00:39:26.984 --> 00:39:28.265]  This is so ludicrous.
[00:39:29.754 --> 00:39:31.955]  It's stunning that we're actually in this position, Alex.
[00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:33.716]  It's like, how was this not raised?
[00:39:33.716 --> 00:39:35.237]  How did we not see this coming?
[00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:36.438]  But I guess we did.
[00:39:36.438 --> 00:39:37.038]  I guess we did.
[00:39:37.038 --> 00:39:40.260]  And I guess we'll be watching to see what comes after this.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.601]  So we're continuing to monitor this.
[00:39:42.601 --> 00:39:51.386]  They're going to have to get probably 100,000 vote advantage the rest of the way, I think, in Maricopa County for Hobbs to win it.
[00:39:52.276 --> 00:39:54.338]  Specifically, rather, in Phoenix.
[00:39:54.338 --> 00:39:55.499]  I don't know if they're going to get it.
[00:39:55.499 --> 00:40:00.403]  Again, the late campaign believes that the ballots coming in are going to be 60% for them because they're in conservative areas.
[00:40:00.403 --> 00:40:02.584]  But hey, who knows when they're coming in?
[00:40:02.584 --> 00:40:03.645]  Who knows who's voting?
[00:40:03.645 --> 00:40:05.066]  Whose ballots they are?
[00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:05.807]  Nobody knows!
[00:40:05.807 --> 00:40:09.250]  In fact, there was an airplane, there was an unmarked airplane flying around
[00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:15.791]  Maricopa County, it was a joke on the internet, it was just a story about a site that follows aircraft news.
[00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:19.272]  There was an unmarked airplane flying around Maricopa County.
[00:40:19.272 --> 00:40:21.053]  The big joke was they were waiting for 3 a.m.
[00:40:21.053 --> 00:40:22.973]  to drop off ballots for Hobbs.
[00:40:22.973 --> 00:40:27.194]  Maybe it wasn't a joke, maybe it's still in flight, just slowly dropping them off.
[00:40:27.194 --> 00:40:31.175]  But hey, let's jump to Nevada, because this is the big one.
[00:40:31.175 --> 00:40:34.056]  I don't know why Nevada hasn't been called for laxalt yet.
[00:40:35.047 --> 00:40:38.550]  And I don't understand what's going on here either.
[00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:46.377]  Now, what we were watching, Alex, was the Las Vegas area, Clark County, is where we've been watching.
[00:40:46.377 --> 00:40:50.741]  That's where we were concerned there was going to be maybe some shenanigans and some voter fraud.
[00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:57.146]  But the Democrats really not doing as well as they would have hoped to in Clark County, as you can see.
[00:40:58.277 --> 00:41:08.310]  Just about 30,000 votes separate Masto and Laxalt there, so that's not a bad number for Republicans, but here's what happened overnight if we zoom back out.
[00:41:09.378 --> 00:41:17.203]  Overnight, here we are in Reno and Washaw County, and now all of a sudden that flipped to blue.
[00:41:17.203 --> 00:41:25.447]  This was red the entire time, it's been red the entire race, and then magically last night it becomes blue.
[00:41:25.447 --> 00:41:29.330]  So now we're going to be watching this to see what kind of margins we have there.
[00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:34.232]  This might have been the area that we weren't expecting the Democrats to try to pull some shenanigans.
[00:41:35.441 --> 00:41:40.968]  Laxalt still ahead by about 15,000 votes, 83% of the vote in.
[00:41:40.968 --> 00:41:47.997]  So now Alex, it's a matter of what are we going to witness between today and tomorrow and then over the weekend?
[00:41:47.997 --> 00:41:51.322]  How much crap are we going to put up with in these races?
[00:41:51.322 --> 00:41:52.423]  Are we going to believe it if...
[00:41:54.005 --> 00:42:01.131]  Masto comes back and beats Laxalt with amazing final drops in Reno and Las Vegas.
[00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:02.292]  Are we just going to take that?
[00:42:02.292 --> 00:42:05.255]  Because here's what it looks like is going to happen.
[00:42:06.823 --> 00:42:09.465]  Laxalt is going to take Nevada.
[00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:11.547]  That gives Republicans 50 seats.
[00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:13.609]  Kelly is going to take Arizona.
[00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:16.572]  That gives the Democrats 49 seats.
[00:42:16.572 --> 00:42:27.422]  And now you have a runoff for the Senate, essentially, in Georgia between Warnock and Walker, which is going to be a complete and total bloodbath.
[00:42:27.782 --> 00:42:31.024]  But it looks like that's where we're going at this point, Alex.
[00:42:31.024 --> 00:42:33.506]  Now, there's a couple other races we're watching.
[00:42:33.506 --> 00:42:38.069]  Lauren Boebert's race, a house race in Colorado, has been pretty odd.
[00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:46.334]  She was actually behind most of the race and has, I think just recently, I don't know the latest numbers, but may have actually pulled ahead of her opponent.
[00:42:46.334 --> 00:42:47.114]  Hold on, stay there, Owen.
[00:42:47.114 --> 00:42:47.875]  We're going to go to break.
[00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:48.856]  We're going to go to break.
[00:42:48.856 --> 00:42:53.218]  We're going to come back with those latest numbers and more and then look at the evidence of fraud.
[00:42:53.218 --> 00:42:54.899]  And Mike Lindell's coming up.
[00:42:54.899 --> 00:42:55.760]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.061]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:43:03.339 --> 00:43:07.683]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:43:07.683 --> 00:43:18.892]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:31.577]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[00:43:31.577 --> 00:43:38.780]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.581]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now, Black Friday comes early.
[00:43:41.801 --> 00:43:42.041]  I think so.
[00:43:59.537 --> 00:44:01.118]  Look around you.
[00:44:01.118 --> 00:44:06.120]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.021]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[00:44:10.021 --> 00:44:19.365]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:25.027]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[00:44:25.027 --> 00:44:28.629]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:32.575]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[00:44:32.575 --> 00:44:38.866]  But I'm being forced by the Bankruptcy Court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[00:44:38.866 --> 00:44:40.148]  It's unsustainable.
[00:44:40.148 --> 00:44:41.390]  So please, visit.

[00:44:52.552 --> 00:44:55.553]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[00:44:55.553 --> 00:44:56.853]  Thank you for your support.
[00:44:56.853 --> 00:44:57.954]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[00:45:07.757 --> 00:45:09.899]  My credibility has never been higher.
[00:45:09.899 --> 00:45:19.245]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[00:45:19.245 --> 00:45:24.869]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[00:45:24.869 --> 00:45:28.512]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:32.457]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.

[00:47:01.168 --> 00:47:07.072]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:12.133 --> 00:47:14.236]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.236 --> 00:47:16.920]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:47:39.116 --> 00:47:44.822]  You know, I really think Tucker Carlson took it to the next level a few nights ago on the eve of the election.
[00:47:44.822 --> 00:47:47.224]  He said, they have to steal the election.
[00:47:47.224 --> 00:47:48.745]  We know they're stealing elections.
[00:47:48.745 --> 00:47:50.527]  We know they're lying frauds.
[00:47:50.527 --> 00:47:56.253]  And just like any other country that goes communist, they never let it go back peacefully.
[00:47:56.253 --> 00:47:58.795]  And that's why they keep saying, don't be violent, don't be violent.
[00:47:58.795 --> 00:48:03.059]  Not because we're going to be violent, but because they intend to get violent with their political opposition.
[00:48:03.817 --> 00:48:12.059]  That is such an important 18-minute monologue he did, and I'm tempted to just play the whole thing here today, but we are in a lot of trouble.
[00:48:12.059 --> 00:48:14.920]  We have to admit that, but fighting back is the way to go.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.981]  This is only going to wake more people up if they've done this.
[00:48:17.981 --> 00:48:31.905]  It's only going to energize folks that much more to understand how much tyranny we're under, because you don't have polls of 70 to 80-plus percent not liking Democrats and Biden and blaming him, and all the polls, exit polls, showing Republican mega-realignment tsunami.
[00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:52.844]  And then the opposite happens, and just these numbers with Mike Lindell, and these aren't just from Mike, Mike's a great guy, we went and looked them up ourselves from the federal database as it released the graphs, and all over the country, just like we saw in Michigan and Pennsylvania before two years ago, right when Trump goes ahead, boom, magically it just shoots up.
[00:48:53.835 --> 00:48:59.078]  Straight line above them, and the same thing's been done over and over again, except they screwed up in Pennsylvania.
[00:48:59.078 --> 00:49:06.361]  They gave 90 plus thousand votes to Fetterman in just one second, and then had to pull that back down because it was just too ridiculous.
[00:49:06.361 --> 00:49:13.585]  So Owen Schroer, please continue analyzing the latest developments and give us your analysis on where you think this is going.
[00:49:13.585 --> 00:49:17.107]  You know, look, I think they stole the runoff two years ago in Georgia.
[00:49:17.107 --> 00:49:20.349]  And so notice, as you predicted Tuesday night, long before
[00:49:21.215 --> 00:49:25.337]  The numbers were clear and it still looked like Republicans were winning in a landslide.
[00:49:25.337 --> 00:49:29.018]  You said, I think they're running the exact same playbook of two years ago.
[00:49:29.018 --> 00:49:35.681]  And it turns out all the same anomalies, all the same problems, everything shaking out down to the runoff in Georgia, deciding it all.
[00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:36.742]  I mean, this is getting ridiculous.
[00:49:38.123 --> 00:49:47.669]  Yeah, and of course, I mean, the Democrats are predictable, Communists are predictable, and when criminals don't get held accountable for their crimes, they're going to repeat the crime.
[00:49:47.669 --> 00:49:49.210]  Let me just break this news right now.
[00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.471]  This has just happened.
[00:49:50.471 --> 00:49:58.317]  Lauren Boebert has indeed flipped her race and is now in the lead for Colorado's 3rd District.
[00:49:58.317 --> 00:50:01.919]  This has been in the Democrat advantage since election night.
[00:50:01.919 --> 00:50:02.799]  It has just flipped.
[00:50:02.799 --> 00:50:04.080]  It's been neck and neck.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.462]  Obviously, Lauren Boebert, a strong Republican.
[00:50:08.063 --> 00:50:08.423]  What's ahead?
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:35.630]  Obviously, with less at stake, without the presidential election going on, but everything we saw in 2020 repeated in a lot of ways of what we saw in 2022.
[00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:49.803]  The one different thing that they did was instead of doing all of the ballot drops, you know, 300,000 here, 200,000 there, in the five states that they stole from Trump at 3.30 in the morning, they did some in the middle of the day, they did some in the morning,
[00:50:50.658 --> 00:50:54.960]  And so I think that they were hoping that would kind of mitigate their strategy.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:51:00.883]  And another trend that I noticed was they're not really showing you the line graphs anymore.
[00:51:00.883 --> 00:51:06.745]  Usually they have the line graphs everywhere, on the mainstream news, on the internet tabulators and everything.
[00:51:06.745 --> 00:51:16.330]  They don't really like us seeing those line graphs anymore because obviously it was used against them with the questions of voter fraud in 2020, where again, we call it the vote Viagra.
[00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:22.656]  Where it's just, okay, normal trends, votes going up, and then a straight line for Biden in five different states.
[00:51:22.656 --> 00:51:28.002]  So I know you're going to be covering that at length with Mike Lindell, so I'll pull back from that.
[00:51:28.002 --> 00:51:32.827]  And I want to talk about two of the big stories that we're seeing.
[00:51:32.827 --> 00:51:37.251]  Well, really three of the stories that we're seeing here, Alex, and that's libertarians' role in elections.
[00:51:38.132 --> 00:51:48.624]  What is going on in inner cities and the Democrats bragging about young voters, while that is a story, I think the bigger story is actually with Latino voters.
[00:51:48.624 --> 00:51:49.865]  So let me start there, Alex.
[00:51:50.947 --> 00:51:54.371]  Because this will lead into the question of what goes on in inner cities.
[00:51:54.371 --> 00:51:56.454]  The Democrats are really pleased with themselves.
[00:51:56.454 --> 00:51:59.698]  They got the young people to turn out to vote today.
[00:51:59.698 --> 00:52:09.091]  And you can see that when you look at these graphs and you go into cities like Madison, Wisconsin, where you have big college populations, or even Austin, Texas, where they didn't do so well.
[00:52:09.531 --> 00:52:18.518]  But you look at these areas kind of outside of the bigger cities, but they have their little college towns where they can get about 50,000 of the young voters to show up, they hope, and vote Democrat.
[00:52:18.518 --> 00:52:19.378]  And they did!
[00:52:19.378 --> 00:52:21.500]  And they had early polling at colleges.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.781]  The Democrats all campaigned at colleges.
[00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:25.763]  It was a strategy that did go well for them.
[00:52:26.383 --> 00:52:31.086]  But all things considered, young people already tend to vote Liberal Democrat.
[00:52:31.086 --> 00:52:33.768]  That's not necessarily such a big news story.
[00:52:33.768 --> 00:52:42.855]  I think the real story is now what you have is the people in college now have never been as radicalized and propagandized by the left as propaganda.
[00:52:43.732 --> 00:52:45.613]  That are now voting for the first time.
[00:52:45.613 --> 00:52:46.813]  That might be the story there.
[00:52:46.813 --> 00:52:52.896]  Nonetheless, everybody knows the older you get, the more life experience you get, the more you tend to vote Republican.
[00:52:52.896 --> 00:52:55.016]  So who knows how much of that they'll retain.
[00:52:55.016 --> 00:52:58.458]  But the Latino voter is another story, Alex.
[00:52:58.458 --> 00:52:59.558]  These are adults.
[00:52:59.558 --> 00:53:00.839]  These are people with families.
[00:53:00.839 --> 00:53:02.519]  These are people with kids.
[00:53:02.519 --> 00:53:05.320]  These are people invested in the American dream.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:12.023]  They're now voting Republican and now overall as a demographic, I would say, showing up to the polls as conservatives.
[00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:15.285]  And so this is really the story that I'm seeing.
[00:53:15.285 --> 00:53:18.308]  This is why Texas had such a strong showing.
[00:53:18.308 --> 00:53:21.310]  This is why Florida had such a strong showing.
[00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.412]  And I think this is about to bleed out.
[00:53:23.412 --> 00:53:28.276]  For some reason in Arizona, Republicans don't do well at the border.
[00:53:28.276 --> 00:53:38.044]  I think that can change as the Latino vote starts to bleed out of Florida, bleed out of Texas, and people start to realize, hey, wait a second, maybe these Democrats have never been in our best favor.
[00:53:38.784 --> 00:53:45.093]  And they're going to realize most of the candidates that run as Democrats in border towns are actually Republicans.
[00:53:45.093 --> 00:53:49.680]  They just can't run as Republicans because they know they won't get any money and they know they won't have a chance.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.903]  So I think that's the real story here.
[00:53:51.903 --> 00:53:53.785]  And now if you look at this, okay.
[00:53:54.599 --> 00:53:58.262]  Because here's the other story that Republicans need to be asking themselves, Alex, and I can go up on the map here.
[00:53:58.262 --> 00:54:13.053]  We can go into Denver, we can go into Chicago, we can go into New York City, we can go into Philadelphia, and you guys can just pull all these cities up in the back and you're going to find out Democrats are getting 80, 70, 90% of the votes in some of these inner cities.
[00:54:13.053 --> 00:54:16.355]  That is a serious story that begs a lot of questions.
[00:54:16.355 --> 00:54:19.678]  But why didn't Miami go Democrat?
[00:54:19.678 --> 00:54:20.718]  Why didn't Miami
[00:54:21.747 --> 00:54:24.213]  Have 80%, 70% for Democrats.
[00:54:24.213 --> 00:54:29.145]  Because Miami is a largely Latino, Hispanic community, Alex.
[00:54:29.145 --> 00:54:30.790]  And it went Republican.
[00:54:31.644 --> 00:54:36.607]  I think this also speaks to how great DeSantis' leadership is, but let's just draw back from that for a second.
[00:54:36.607 --> 00:54:39.729]  The Trump-DeSantis debate is obviously going to be raging.
[00:54:39.729 --> 00:54:49.714]  I think what you see here is Miami, with a strong Latino vote showing up for Republican, flipping a major city that obviously favors Democrats.
[00:54:49.714 --> 00:54:59.740]  Now, people might also argue Ron DeSantis did a great job getting the voter rolls cleaned up, making sure they ran a good, clean election in Florida, so that argument can be made too.
[00:55:01.004 --> 00:55:08.832]  But why isn't the Republican Party asking the question of how Democrats get 70% and 80% in these cities?
[00:55:08.832 --> 00:55:14.518]  So guys, you can pull up Chicago, pull up New York, pull up Philadelphia, whatever you guys want on the map here, but you'll see.
[00:55:14.518 --> 00:55:19.043]  I mean, you go to Chicago here, Alex, I mean, these numbers are out of control.
[00:55:19.043 --> 00:55:21.345]  73% for the Democrat, Duckworth.
[00:55:22.479 --> 00:55:23.639]  And this trend repeats itself.
[00:55:23.639 --> 00:55:25.180]  It's even worse in New York City.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:37.323]  Democrats are getting 90% of the vote in New York City, which by the way, I think that it's time for the New York upper state body to separate from the island and New York City.
[00:55:37.323 --> 00:55:41.524]  These numbers are so ridiculous, the splits there are so ridiculous, it needs to be a serious conversation.
[00:55:41.524 --> 00:55:43.144]  But let's not talk about that now.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:53.104]  So are Republicans that pathetic that they can't even get into the cities and even make these things contestable?
[00:55:53.104 --> 00:56:01.508]  Like they can't even draw Democrats down to getting like 60% instead of 70, 80% so that they can help their Senate candidates, so that they can help their Governor candidates?
[00:56:02.228 --> 00:56:03.668]  Is there just no interest there?
[00:56:03.668 --> 00:56:05.689]  Is there not even going to be a question of voter fraud?
[00:56:05.689 --> 00:56:07.469]  Are we not even going to raise the question?
[00:56:07.469 --> 00:56:11.230]  How do Democrats get 90%, 80%, 70% in all these cities?
[00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.671]  Oh, stay there.
[00:56:11.671 --> 00:56:20.173]  We're going to come back in five minutes with you, and then Mike Lindell's coming on to go over what he calls the crime spikes, and Crime Watch Live, and all the rest of it.

[00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:07.249]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:59:07.249 --> 00:59:08.530]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:09.930]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:15.194]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:59:15.194 --> 00:59:17.597]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[00:59:17.597 --> 00:59:19.618]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:59:19.618 --> 00:59:26.565]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalists' agenda.
[00:59:27.185 --> 00:59:32.588]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.

[00:59:57.564 --> 01:00:06.747]  All right, final segment with Owen Schroyer.
[01:00:06.747 --> 01:00:10.808]  Did a great job laying out these races and what's unfolding.
[01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:15.369]  Mike Lindell with huge news coming up here in just a moment.
[01:00:15.369 --> 01:00:16.930]  Other key points you'd like to add, Owen?
[01:00:18.891 --> 01:00:23.794]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to be talking about in the war room, because here's what I'm seeing.
[01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:29.777]  There's the DeSantis-Trump debate that's obviously raging and people are kind of picking sides right now.
[01:00:29.777 --> 01:00:33.699]  Alright, I think mostly people are getting ahead of themselves and it's a politically charged season.
[01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:54.611]  debate the real movement i'm seeing here that needs to be focused on is the removal of power from uh... the mic republicans mcconnell mccartney annual their ouster it's time for them to go you already have republicans that just won reelections calling for it it's pretty much wide swept across the media conservative media
[01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:56.973]  They don't want this Republican leadership anymore.
[01:00:56.973 --> 01:00:58.235]  They're not happy with the results.
[01:00:58.235 --> 01:01:00.338]  They believe Republicans should have done much better.
[01:01:00.338 --> 01:01:12.813]  So that's a consensus right now in the Republican voter base, in the populist movement that is trying to take over the Republican Party from the establishment and the Uniparty, that the McOuster needs to happen.
[01:01:14.014 --> 01:01:17.236]  McCarthy and McConnell have got to go.
[01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:19.098]  And so we're going to see how that develops.
[01:01:19.098 --> 01:01:29.685]  But I think there's going to be enough of an initiative and a charge with this 218th Congress that you might actually see a position change in those positions.
[01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:30.465]  And good.
[01:01:30.465 --> 01:01:34.888]  The Republican Party has such great talent and such great potential coming up through it.
[01:01:34.888 --> 01:01:41.853]  It'd be ridiculous to keep these people around who don't energize the party or reach out to the young or the cities at all.
[01:01:41.853 --> 01:01:43.634]  So that's going to be a great thing.
[01:01:44.495 --> 01:01:49.159]  That's going to come from this, no matter how the numbers shake out in Congress at the end of the day.
[01:01:49.159 --> 01:01:55.686]  Now here's another big, maybe not big, kind of a side issue that I'm seeing, and that's the Libertarian vote.
[01:01:55.686 --> 01:02:00.972]  In a lot of these races, Georgia might be your best example, but I think Pennsylvania, it was the same case.
[01:02:00.972 --> 01:02:05.016]  The Libertarian vote was more than enough to, if you would give
[01:02:05.636 --> 01:02:09.660]  All the votes, it would always put the Republican ahead, but I don't even think they would need all the Libertarian vote.
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:19.409]  I think they would really just need 90% of the Libertarian vote, and I believe it would have put Oz ahead, and it definitely would have given Walker the majority, and he would have won the Senate.
[01:02:19.409 --> 01:02:20.650]  And so I understand...
[01:02:21.522 --> 01:02:24.383]  I'm not going to get into the Libertarian bashing game here.
[01:02:24.383 --> 01:02:26.925]  I understand why Libertarians exist.
[01:02:26.925 --> 01:02:31.787]  I understand why they have a disposition towards the Republican and the Democrat Party.
[01:02:31.787 --> 01:02:36.689]  And I understand why you vote third party and why you keep a third party out there.
[01:02:36.689 --> 01:02:47.335]  But I think that Libertarians are not being fully honest with themselves after the results of this election because if you don't see how you have a real power here,
[01:02:48.336 --> 01:02:53.459]  Because they say, oh well, I don't want to vote for the two corrupt parties, or I don't want to vote for this person or that person.
[01:02:53.459 --> 01:02:55.020]  Well, how about I put it to you this way.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.902]  Let me give the Libertarians a pitch here, because I'm not a Republican, I'm an Independent.
[01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:05.275]  But let me give the Libertarians a push here of why, a pitch of why they should be moving their votes to Republican.
[01:03:05.275 --> 01:03:08.117]  Do you want to vote for the Democrat that's going to take your gun?
[01:03:08.117 --> 01:03:09.838]  Or do you want to vote for the Republican that's not?
[01:03:09.838 --> 01:03:12.880]  I mean, do I really have to say anything else?
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:21.105]  And here's the classy way to do it, and this is what happened in Arizona, Alex, and I don't know if it's going to be enough to put Masters ahead, but they still have their fingers crossed.
[01:03:21.105 --> 01:03:27.069]  The Libertarian candidate in Arizona bowed out about a week or two before the election and endorsed Blake Masters.
[01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:29.131]  That's what the Libertarians need to do at this point.
[01:03:30.034 --> 01:03:34.937]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:38.199]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Georgia.
[01:03:38.199 --> 01:03:40.961]  I understand you don't like the Republican Party.
[01:03:40.961 --> 01:03:42.202]  I get it.
[01:03:42.202 --> 01:03:43.383]  I get it.
[01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:55.771]  But if you don't see the power in what you can do now, just by endorsing the candidate that's not going to take your guns, hopefully not raise your taxes, but I get it, Republicans do that too, but just on the issue of guns.
[01:03:55.771 --> 01:03:56.832]  I mean, isn't it easy enough?
[01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.133]  I mean, isn't that clear enough?
[01:03:58.133 --> 01:03:59.734]  Do you want to be disarmed or not?
[01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:05.518]  So that's another issue that I kind of see as a side hors d'oeuvre, Alex, that people are going to be talking about.
[01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:08.501]  But these are the big issues that I see that we're going to be covering on The War Room.
[01:04:08.501 --> 01:04:12.404]  I'm looking forward to hearing from Mike Lindell with these ridiculous numbers.
[01:04:12.404 --> 01:04:14.485]  It's the exact same playbook they ran in 2020.
[01:04:14.485 --> 01:04:15.946]  Well, let's do this, Owen.
[01:04:15.946 --> 01:04:20.089]  I know you've got to get ready for your own show at 3 today, but Mike Lindell's giving us the whole hour.
[01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:24.333]  I know you'll have some great questions and great analysis, so you get your big board ready in there.
[01:04:24.933 --> 01:04:31.040]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we'll have you pop in with some comments, analysis, and any questions for Mike Lindell.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.101]  And then you'll be back at 3 p.m.
[01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:35.404]  Central with The War Room and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:35.925]  That sound good?
[01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:37.006]  All right.
[01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:37.566]  We'll be right here.
[01:04:37.566 --> 01:04:38.167]  All right.
[01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:38.968]  Great job, the crew.
[01:04:38.968 --> 01:04:41.230]  Great job, the listeners, keeping us on air.
[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:42.271]  Folks have really come through.
[01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:45.594]  We're treading water here, but we're still in the fight, just like America is.
[01:04:45.594 --> 01:04:46.295]  We're not going to give up.
[01:04:47.446 --> 01:04:49.408]  Alright, we'll be right back with Mike Lindell.
[01:04:49.408 --> 01:04:51.010]  InfoWars.com.
[01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.873]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:29.705]  We're good to go.
[01:06:06.494 --> 01:06:11.099]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:11.099 --> 01:06:16.164]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:20.561 --> 01:06:24.702]  I'm like an octopus with eight arms trying to fight the new world order with everything I got.
[01:06:24.702 --> 01:06:26.383]  What's up, Mike Lindell?
[01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:30.564]  I mean, even during the break, the guy is like directing five different people to do five different things.
[01:06:30.564 --> 01:06:31.744]  Just amazing.
[01:06:31.744 --> 01:06:35.965]  And he was dead on about election fraud, and now he's built the organization to expose it.
[01:06:35.965 --> 01:06:39.146]  And he's joined us for the full hour here.
[01:06:39.146 --> 01:06:40.786]  And I went and checked the data he put out.
[01:06:40.786 --> 01:06:41.606]  It's dead on.
[01:06:41.606 --> 01:06:43.267]  He was the first to put it out.
[01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:45.688]  And it's just been on top of his amazing team.
[01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:47.168]  We have things like Fetterman.
[01:06:48.479 --> 01:07:04.082]  With these crime spikes, as Mike Lindell has coined here, with these crime spikes, we have all of this happening, and then we have votes being taken away from Fetterman because they obviously added too many to it.
[01:07:04.082 --> 01:07:13.245]  But I want to say something before we play a short compilation of some of the highlights of their election coverage, and we go right to the great guy himself, Mike Lindell, there on screen.
[01:07:13.245 --> 01:07:14.845]  We're in a fight against the New World Order.
[01:07:15.345 --> 01:07:15.505]  That's
[01:07:35.323 --> 01:07:35.583]  I think so.
[01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:04.271]  Cheats as low as $49.95.
[01:08:04.271 --> 01:08:06.292]  It goes on and on.

[01:08:55.943 --> 01:08:58.684]  He'll tell you all about it before he leaves us in like 50 minutes.
[01:08:58.684 --> 01:09:00.984]  But I wanted to play a compilation.
[01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:02.225]  He was asking me before he went live.
[01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.866]  Right during the break he said, did you see our coverage?
[01:09:04.866 --> 01:09:06.707]  I said, well of course I was watching, everybody is.
[01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:07.888]  You've done the best job.
[01:09:07.888 --> 01:09:08.769]  You've nailed it.
[01:09:08.769 --> 01:09:11.831]  And he said, did you see my crime spikes and live time crime?
[01:09:11.831 --> 01:09:12.791]  I said, of course.
[01:09:12.791 --> 01:09:15.493]  I've got a compilation of some of the best of it.
[01:09:15.493 --> 01:09:17.854]  We'll air a few minutes of it and go to the man.
[01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:18.775]  Mike Lindell, here it is.
[01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:21.776]  Note we have here, we have the votes going up.
[01:09:21.776 --> 01:09:22.976]  I'm putting my cursor over it.
[01:09:22.976 --> 01:09:25.196]  Votes going and staying the same, staying the same.
[01:09:25.196 --> 01:09:31.878]  And then we have, we go from 326,000 votes down to 288,000 votes.
[01:09:31.878 --> 01:09:33.398]  So, where'd they go?
[01:09:33.398 --> 01:09:34.178]  They're gone.
[01:09:34.178 --> 01:09:35.979]  You can't go and reverse everybody.
[01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:42.000]  These are the order, these votes are coming in through the Edison Report, which is one of the biggest monopolies in this country.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.261]  Every single vote goes through New Jersey and then it comes out to us.
[01:09:47.081 --> 01:09:53.947]  I switched over, while you were talking, to the governor race in Pennsylvania, and you'll see it happened there too.
[01:09:53.947 --> 01:10:08.257]  So we have a 63,000, we have a 90,000 crime spike, another 90,000 crime spike, a 63,000 crime spike, and then they go, uh-oh, the whole world's gonna know that Mastriano's getting, you know, we're cheating by too much.
[01:10:08.257 --> 01:10:09.398]  So what do they do, everybody?
[01:10:09.398 --> 01:10:11.160]  Right there, point to the cursor?
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.601]  They took away 90,000 votes from the Democrat.
[01:10:15.899 --> 01:10:21.703]  Yeah, if you look, it took the vote total back to where it had been way back here.
[01:10:21.703 --> 01:10:23.685]  These are real-time crime spikes!
[01:10:24.489 --> 01:10:26.551]  Machine manipulation?
[01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:27.332]  Look at that.
[01:10:27.332 --> 01:10:29.874]  You see that Democrat going, ding!
[01:10:29.874 --> 01:10:33.537]  Up 150,000 votes because Herschel was taking the lead.
[01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:36.680]  So they just dumped a bunch of votes by computer in there.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.541]  Everybody can understand that.
[01:10:38.541 --> 01:10:41.344]  That's something everybody can enjoy, real-time crime.
[01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:44.186]  That's right there in front of you.
[01:10:44.186 --> 01:10:48.250]  That's 100,000 votes that comes out of nowhere.
[01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.571]  That's just not real.
[01:10:50.228 --> 01:10:54.730]  If you took that real spike out, that crime spike, Herschel would be up by 150,000 votes.
[01:10:54.730 --> 01:11:01.432]  Yeah, it looks like about a 100,000 vote spike there, if I'm reading that correctly.
[01:11:01.432 --> 01:11:03.713]  Out of nowhere, yes, that one.
[01:11:03.713 --> 01:11:10.956]  For Gretchen Whitmer, that has all the indications of a vote dump.
[01:11:12.016 --> 01:11:15.978]  Uh, of likely counterfeit ballots.
[01:11:15.978 --> 01:11:20.361]  Both of these look really, really strange, but in particular... Yeah, this one.
[01:11:20.361 --> 01:11:25.344]  Yeah, that one... Because there was almost hardly any increase in the other one.
[01:11:25.344 --> 01:11:25.584]  Yeah.
[01:11:25.584 --> 01:11:28.445]  That's 2223, so that's 1023 p.m.
[01:11:28.445 --> 01:11:30.527]  Eastern Time, if I'm reading that correctly.
[01:11:30.527 --> 01:11:31.327]  Correct.
[01:11:31.327 --> 01:11:36.150]  And so, that is almost beyond belief.
[01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:39.173]  Wow, look at this everybody!
[01:11:39.173 --> 01:11:43.617]  That's a million votes up and a million votes down.
[01:11:43.617 --> 01:11:48.461]  You know, a million votes here and a million votes there and eventually it adds up to a real, you know, real election.
[01:11:48.461 --> 01:11:49.783]  Can you explain this one?
[01:11:50.746 --> 01:11:51.927]  Can you explain this?
[01:11:51.927 --> 01:11:53.869]  Well, I can't really explain it.
[01:11:53.869 --> 01:11:56.471]  I mean, I can't... There is no explanation.
[01:11:56.471 --> 01:12:03.838]  There is no explanation, but you see that you had an update at Eastern Time, what is that, 1042, of about a million votes for...
[01:12:07.802 --> 01:12:23.427]  Duckworth and pretty much none for the other person and then you see it wasn't like it was something that came right back It's like we kept on having little more updates little more updates And then suddenly there goes the million votes back down again that million person
[01:12:24.082 --> 01:12:30.007]  We're going to have more of these highlights in the hour, but I got to get to the man himself, Mike Lindell.
[01:12:30.007 --> 01:12:32.490]  Wow, incredible time to be alive.
[01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:33.430]  We only got four minutes to break.
[01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.871]  We'll come back.
[01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:35.753]  You'll have the floor, but just a snapshot.
[01:12:35.753 --> 01:12:39.036]  You hear the guy literally at the heart of the fight against these people.
[01:12:39.036 --> 01:12:40.457]  What is really going on, Mike Lindell?
[01:12:41.795 --> 01:12:46.997]  Well, what they're doing is the same thing that they did in the 2020 election and in the primaries, by the way.
[01:12:46.997 --> 01:12:48.497]  What they do is they poll.
[01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:53.899]  That's why we told everybody to vote same day and don't vote early or with the mail and all this stuff.
[01:12:53.899 --> 01:12:55.499]  They're just pulling names.
[01:12:55.499 --> 01:13:00.781]  The computer just pulls names and you get these injections of votes.
[01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:02.441]  So let's use the Os race.
[01:13:05.262 --> 01:13:10.684]  You know, with Betterment, they did 590,000 vote injections.
[01:13:10.684 --> 01:13:12.665]  So as soon as it gets close, boom, boom.
[01:13:12.665 --> 01:13:24.350]  Now once it's the day of votes, like we're seeing down in Arizona right now, all these day of votes come in, and those votes aren't as corrupted, or might not be at all.
[01:13:24.910 --> 01:13:29.974]  But this is what's happening, and we have to get rid of the machines.
[01:13:29.974 --> 01:13:39.221]  And this time, though, the miracle, everybody, I want to tell everyone the miracle is that when I woke up on election day, I'm going, I'm hearing from 32 states.
[01:13:39.221 --> 01:13:46.506]  Remember, I have people in 50 states, Alex, and all 50 states, we have a massive amount of people on the ground.
[01:13:47.046 --> 01:13:58.474]  And it was reported in 32 of the states, machine malfunctioning, just like Arizona, which made national news and international news, that they weren't even accepting ballots.
[01:13:58.474 --> 01:13:59.415]  People were getting there.
[01:13:59.415 --> 01:14:01.436]  They're going, oh, you've already voted.
[01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.398]  You pull out your little mail-in ballots.
[01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:04.518]  And no, I haven't.
[01:14:04.518 --> 01:14:06.620]  They called their sheriff's departments.
[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:14.265]  So right away, the awareness that was made around the world about these machines, that was like a divine intervention.
[01:14:14.265 --> 01:14:15.306]  That was a gift from God.
[01:14:15.726 --> 01:14:19.928]  And then now we're seeing what goes on inside the machines.
[01:14:19.928 --> 01:14:24.610]  And we overrun the algorithms, I believe, so far in at least nine races.
[01:14:24.610 --> 01:14:28.271]  But obviously we have all the evidence now of all the ones they stole.
[01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:32.573]  They decimated Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[01:14:32.573 --> 01:14:33.833]  They just took it all.
[01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:35.994]  They weren't even shy about it this time around.
[01:14:37.659 --> 01:14:45.203]  What's incredible is, even Tucker Carlson, that hasn't really looked at the fraud, now he agrees with you and says they clearly stole it.
[01:14:45.203 --> 01:14:46.644]  So, congratulations.
[01:14:46.644 --> 01:14:52.527]  Nobody deserves more credit than you and your supporters and our supporters, because Mike, you've been through hell, and you're a winner.
[01:14:52.527 --> 01:14:59.931]  You don't complain about it, but buddy, you've been raided by the FBI, you've been attacked, you've been deplatformed, you have been savage, but you seem stronger for it.
[01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:03.483]  Yeah, well, you know, it's my faith in God.
[01:15:03.483 --> 01:15:07.166]  And I'll tell you, Alex, we don't want to be Venezuela.
[01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:12.609]  And we got a perfect example right before this election of what they did to Brazil.
[01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:16.110]  5.1 million votes were stolen from that great President Barsanaro.
[01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:21.313]  And you've seen all the millions of people out there going, this can't be, this can't be.
[01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:21.994]  But you know what?
[01:15:21.994 --> 01:15:24.075]  The mainstream media didn't even cover that.
[01:15:24.773 --> 01:15:25.934]  So you are right.
[01:15:25.934 --> 01:15:32.658]  I am so happy right now that Tucker and other news outlets actually started covering this.
[01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:45.226]  If they start covering the real-time crime and start covering these things, we're going to get there a lot faster to this beautiful place we're going than we could ever think that we'd get there that fast.
[01:15:45.226 --> 01:15:46.487]  All right, Mike Lindell.
[01:15:46.487 --> 01:15:48.368]  Mike Lindell, truly the man in the arena.
[01:15:48.368 --> 01:15:53.912]  I'm going to come back and give you the floor to get into everything because you are, again, absolutely on target.
[01:15:57.321 --> 01:16:03.301]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:16:04.597 --> 01:16:14.987]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:27.718]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:16:28.399 --> 01:16:28.959]  We're good.
[01:16:57.581 --> 01:17:03.673]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:17:03.673 --> 01:17:06.778]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:12.777]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:17:12.777 --> 01:17:17.159]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[01:17:17.159 --> 01:17:22.861]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:17:22.861 --> 01:17:27.442]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:33.605]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[01:17:34.085 --> 01:17:46.051]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:52.174]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:52.174 --> 01:17:53.995]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[01:17:57.608 --> 01:18:03.198]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[01:18:04.372 --> 01:18:18.156]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:18:18.156 --> 01:18:32.220]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[01:18:36.858 --> 01:18:40.299]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:43.099]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[01:18:43.099 --> 01:18:47.400]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:01.746]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[01:19:01.746 --> 01:19:04.888]  But when you fight tyranny, the New World Order comes after you.
[01:19:04.888 --> 01:19:06.509]  Now, I knew that.
[01:19:06.509 --> 01:19:09.331]  And for 28 years, I've been on there exposing these people.
[01:19:09.331 --> 01:19:11.152]  And together, we've had a great effect.
[01:19:11.152 --> 01:19:13.234]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[01:19:13.234 --> 01:19:14.394]  They're trying to shut us down.
[01:19:14.394 --> 01:19:16.456]  But they can't beat the power of We The People.
[01:19:16.616 --> 01:19:17.356]  We're good to go!

[01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.965]  This is by far the biggest sell of the year.
[01:19:50.965 --> 01:19:52.947]  Keeps us on air, plus they're great products.
[01:19:52.947 --> 01:19:58.931]  Check them out at m4wrestore.com with promo code 1776.
[01:19:58.931 --> 01:20:04.836]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.612 --> 01:20:14.355]  I think what Mike Lindell said earlier in the last segment on the Alex Jones Show is so central.
[01:20:14.355 --> 01:20:23.742]  If we hadn't had all the poll watchers, if we hadn't had the massive resistance exposing the fraud, it would have been far worse and we wouldn't even have a shot at the House or the Senate.
[01:20:23.742 --> 01:20:25.343]  But we're on the march.
[01:20:25.343 --> 01:20:29.766]  The vote stealers and their crime spikes are on the run.
[01:20:29.766 --> 01:20:31.988]  And so Mike, you are the encyclopedia on this.
[01:20:32.628 --> 01:20:42.562]  I'm going to try for the rest of the hour to give you the floor to just go through what happened, what's happening currently, what you see coming next, and how we're going to peacefully expose this.
[01:20:42.562 --> 01:20:45.326]  Well, we have breaking news just on break here.
[01:20:45.326 --> 01:20:46.809]  I got a text from our lawyers.
[01:20:48.381 --> 01:21:03.747]  I don't know if everybody knew out there, but there was a company, CEO, called Koenig, out of Michigan, that got charged with probably the biggest LARDA data breach in United States history, which was in our elections.
[01:21:03.747 --> 01:21:05.388]  And this is out of China, everybody!
[01:21:06.088 --> 01:21:15.011]  Which I've been saying all along, that the CCP combined with the United Party, the Globalists and the Deep State, this is the attack, this is who's attacking our country.
[01:21:15.011 --> 01:21:17.332]  The Democrat Party just loves to join on in.
[01:21:17.332 --> 01:21:25.954]  Now let me tell you, they just dropped the charges against Koenig, against the CEO.
[01:21:25.954 --> 01:21:27.515]  It's disgusting.
[01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:30.776]  Now you think that China isn't involved in our government?
[01:21:30.776 --> 01:21:33.937]  It's absolutely disgusting what they just happened.
[01:21:35.083 --> 01:21:43.876]  And it says that their office, they took out a press release saying they didn't rely on True2Vote's data, that they did their own investigation.
[01:21:43.876 --> 01:21:45.438]  Lie!
[01:21:45.438 --> 01:21:48.903]  Remember, they put the True2Vote, Catherine and Greg, in jail.
[01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:51.287]  They put them in jail for almost, what, a week?
[01:21:52.882 --> 01:21:54.264]  And that's important to add.
[01:21:54.264 --> 01:21:55.226]  You're getting SWAT teamed.
[01:21:55.226 --> 01:21:58.812]  People are being thrown in jail as you're exposing this and being vindicated.
[01:21:58.812 --> 01:22:04.421]  That's why people need to be praying for you and everybody that's supporting what you're doing, including InfoWars, because folks, you want us to fight.
[01:22:04.421 --> 01:22:05.022]  We're doing it.
[01:22:05.022 --> 01:22:05.403]  Continue.
[01:22:06.573 --> 01:22:10.036]  Yep, you guys are awesome, everybody, with your support.
[01:22:10.036 --> 01:22:13.658]  So this is what we're up against, but I'll tell you some other lawsuits.
[01:22:13.658 --> 01:22:21.164]  There's over 45 lawsuits going on in this country right now that we're fighting for in every state and we're adding to it today.
[01:22:21.164 --> 01:22:22.925]  We have one in Arizona.
[01:22:22.925 --> 01:22:24.346]  I'll give you Arizona here.
[01:22:24.346 --> 01:22:32.652]  We appealed, we just appealed to deny, remember they denied Cochise County in Arizona.
[01:22:32.652 --> 01:22:34.674]  They told them they couldn't hand count the election.
[01:22:35.314 --> 01:22:36.355]  What?
[01:22:36.355 --> 01:22:36.996]  Why?
[01:22:36.996 --> 01:22:40.940]  Why would you come in there and get a ruling from a corrupt judge or something?
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.562]  I don't know.
[01:22:42.562 --> 01:22:44.223]  He ruled that you can't do a hand count.
[01:22:44.223 --> 01:22:47.226]  Well, we appealed that to the Arizona Supreme Court.
[01:22:47.226 --> 01:22:49.028]  We'll see what comes of that.
[01:22:49.028 --> 01:22:52.051]  Over in Wisconsin, let's move over to Wisconsin.
[01:22:52.051 --> 01:22:54.053]  There, you won't even believe this one.
[01:22:54.053 --> 01:22:55.975]  This is the complaint.
[01:22:56.658 --> 01:22:59.619]  That's compiled against the WEC.
[01:22:59.619 --> 01:23:02.721]  This is the Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[01:23:02.721 --> 01:23:03.541]  Okay?
[01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:06.122]  The Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[01:23:06.122 --> 01:23:15.687]  And there, there's been two-way communication between tabulators that goes out to an unofficial address.
[01:23:15.687 --> 01:23:18.068]  It's called WISCNET.NET.
[01:23:18.068 --> 01:23:20.369]  It goes to this foundation called WISCNET.NET.
[01:23:24.924 --> 01:23:29.927]  And all of our stuff, all the Wisconsin elections and our stuff across the country is going to these guys.
[01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:32.229]  Then it goes out from there all over the place.
[01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:40.354]  So we put a complaint in there, a lawsuit in there, get to the bottom of it, and I just want everybody to know there's hope everywhere.
[01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:49.340]  And now that we're going to get the House, I believe we'll get the House and the Senate, I believe right now you got the stuff going on, which I can tell you about in a minute, an update on that.
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:51.742]  But to slow the destruction of our country,
[01:23:52.785 --> 01:23:58.676]  But in the meantime, the big smoking gun is getting rid of these electronic computers and voting machines.
[01:23:58.676 --> 01:24:01.161]  We have to get down to elections, not selections.
[01:24:03.658 --> 01:24:20.868]  We've got, there's just so much hope out there, but I know if you're in Michigan or you woke up, you're in Michigan, Colorado, Pennsylvania, so many of them have lost hope now, Alex, because they were just decimated by the stolen election, by these elections that were stolen.
[01:24:20.868 --> 01:24:23.129]  But let me tell you, I'll give an example.
[01:24:23.129 --> 01:24:27.912]  Our cyber guys were watching, do you know in Pennsylvania and Georgia,
[01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:40.097]  The same attacks, the same, some of the same IP addresses that did this in 2020 and in a couple of the primaries came from the same place.
[01:24:40.097 --> 01:24:48.382]  So we're getting deeper and deeper into that and there's just so much hope in this country right now.
[01:24:48.382 --> 01:24:48.782]  I'm happy.
[01:24:48.782 --> 01:24:51.924]  I want to say this to everybody too.
[01:24:51.924 --> 01:24:54.666]  Everyone goes, well, Mike, we didn't get the red wave we wanted.
[01:24:55.385 --> 01:24:58.152]  You guys, that's a miracle we didn't get that.
[01:24:58.152 --> 01:25:00.838]  We are so blessed that we didn't get that, and here's why.
[01:25:00.838 --> 01:25:03.384]  If we'd have got this big red wave...
[01:25:04.244 --> 01:25:08.588]  If I'd have been there, Marcus, I'd have said, don't do anything stupid with the machines.
[01:25:08.588 --> 01:25:13.251]  Let's let this go and we can take the country later.
[01:25:13.251 --> 01:25:14.753]  They're on to us.
[01:25:14.753 --> 01:25:17.755]  If it had been a big red wave, you know what they would have said to people like me?
[01:25:17.755 --> 01:25:24.160]  They would have said, Mike, it's okay to have all these mail-in ballots from the China virus and all this garbage.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:27.142]  Two months of early voting like my home state of Minnesota.
[01:25:27.142 --> 01:25:28.283]  Mike, it's all okay.
[01:25:28.283 --> 01:25:31.026]  The machines, look at the Republicans won.
[01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:32.587]  This isn't about that, everybody.
[01:25:34.233 --> 01:25:39.094]  The UNA party was there, the CCP, this is what was taking our country.
[01:25:39.094 --> 01:25:42.575]  Over 50 countries have been taken by the machines.
[01:25:42.575 --> 01:25:46.695]  There's my own governor's race, look at this.
[01:25:46.695 --> 01:25:49.296]  He lives in my hometown, Scott Jensen.
[01:25:49.296 --> 01:25:52.797]  Right out of the gate, they just dumped it on Waltz.
[01:25:52.797 --> 01:25:55.437]  They gave him a quarter million votes, extra votes.
[01:25:55.437 --> 01:25:56.717]  Here you go, Waltz.
[01:25:56.717 --> 01:25:58.197]  And look at that, all the way up.
[01:25:58.197 --> 01:26:00.038]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[01:26:00.038 --> 01:26:00.818]  They stole it.
[01:26:01.471 --> 01:26:04.052]  You know, and this went on across our country.
[01:26:04.052 --> 01:26:07.833]  This is machine manipulation, everybody, and computers.
[01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.794]  We cannot have computers.
[01:26:09.794 --> 01:26:11.175]  We're at an apex in history.
[01:26:11.175 --> 01:26:18.497]  We get one chance, one chance for our freedoms to be back and to save our country.
[01:26:20.999 --> 01:26:23.440]  I want to tell you, look at this, look at here in Michigan.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.261]  This is when I went to bed on election night, 2 in the morning.
[01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:34.482]  This happened at 1, or about 12.58, might have been a little after 1 o'clock in the morning, the traditional Michigan dump.
[01:26:34.482 --> 01:26:37.603]  Look what they gave to Nestle.
[01:26:37.603 --> 01:26:46.645]  They gave Nestle, I think it was 200,000 or more than that, votes, and just took Matt DiPerno's dream, and everyone's dream, boom, gone.
[01:26:46.645 --> 01:26:48.846]  That's the Attorney General of Michigan, everybody.
[01:26:49.546 --> 01:26:51.728]  They stole it in real time!
[01:26:51.728 --> 01:26:56.691]  Mike, the graph says it gave them 300,000 plus votes.
[01:26:56.691 --> 01:26:59.533]  300,000 plus votes instantly.
[01:26:59.533 --> 01:27:00.153]  Instantly!
[01:27:00.153 --> 01:27:04.936]  You guys, this came down, and let me tell you, I'm going to tell you how similar it was to the 2020 election in Michigan.
[01:27:07.702 --> 01:27:09.244]  When they stopped everything.
[01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:12.787]  And by the way, isn't it weird that they stopped everything in 2020?
[01:27:12.787 --> 01:27:14.188]  All the states at the same time?
[01:27:14.188 --> 01:27:16.250]  You think there's not some communication there?
[01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.871]  Shut her down!
[01:27:16.871 --> 01:27:17.972]  We got a problem!
[01:27:17.972 --> 01:27:22.476]  Donald Trump's gonna win all these states anyway because he's overrunning the algorithms!
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:47.762]  Well, let me tell you, in Michigan, when 106,000 votes came down for Biden at two in the morning in Michigan, and 3,000 for Donald Trump, and everyone said to us, the big lie was, well, you know, those darn inner city, those darn votes from, you know, the Democrats all voted, you know, for those mail-in votes, those darn mail-in votes.
[01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:48.563]  Well, let me tell you,
[01:27:49.426 --> 01:28:05.518]  If Fox News or any other news outlet that we had at that time had grown to trust, if they'd have got on there and said, hey everybody, the mail-in votes in Michigan were counted on the morning of the 3rd, not in the middle of the night on the 4th.
[01:28:05.518 --> 01:28:08.240]  Everyone would have said, well then where'd they come from?
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:13.604]  I'll tell you where they came from, a big white van that pulled in and three fobs and a download of 106,000 votes for Biden.
[01:28:15.846 --> 01:28:18.327]  So this went on again.
[01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:20.088]  Everyone needs to understand.
[01:28:20.088 --> 01:28:23.509]  The same input is going to give you the same output.
[01:28:23.509 --> 01:28:26.370]  We were getting boiled like frogs for two decades.
[01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:29.212]  The Democrats even warned against these machines.
[01:28:29.212 --> 01:28:33.613]  But now that they're on the right side of a fixed game, they don't care.
[01:28:33.613 --> 01:28:34.994]  There it is in Michigan.
[01:28:34.994 --> 01:28:36.835]  It brings back memories.
[01:28:36.835 --> 01:28:37.935]  All the memories.
[01:28:37.935 --> 01:28:39.176]  There they come.
[01:28:39.176 --> 01:28:41.517]  Let's drop 106,000 votes for Biden in the middle of the night.
[01:28:43.055 --> 01:28:45.900]  And, um, which brings up another point.
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.743]  Remember... Michael and Bill, stay there.
[01:28:47.743 --> 01:28:48.645]  You'll have the floor.
[01:28:48.645 --> 01:28:49.806]  You're on fire.
[01:28:49.806 --> 01:28:54.174]  When we come back on the other side of this break, we'll continue to run the entire field here.
[01:29:00.319 --> 01:29:04.663]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:29:04.663 --> 01:29:15.855]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:29:16.275 --> 01:29:28.586]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[01:32:10.780 --> 01:32:26.992]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[01:32:26.992 --> 01:32:29.894]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[01:32:30.797 --> 01:32:37.379]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[01:32:37.379 --> 01:32:39.080]  I don't take the credit.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:40.780]  I give you the credit.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:43.401]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[01:32:43.401 --> 01:32:45.001]  It isn't going to give up.
[01:32:45.001 --> 01:32:46.842]  Without your support we could be shut down.

[01:32:58.214 --> 01:33:02.817]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:02.817 --> 01:33:10.302]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.302 --> 01:33:15.306]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:33:15.306 --> 01:33:18.548]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.548 --> 01:33:20.349]  Our jobs have been shipped overseas.
[01:33:20.349 --> 01:33:21.550]  We've been de-industrialized.
[01:33:21.550 --> 01:33:25.033]  They've cut our power supplies off to bankrupt us and get us under control.
[01:33:25.033 --> 01:33:26.614]  They're trying to pay Americans not to work.
[01:33:27.779 --> 01:33:39.568]  And if you read different documents that came out from the Clinton Library, National Library, a few years ago, when World Net Daily sued and got the documents, when they first got into office in 93, they were obsessed with killing the U.S.
[01:33:39.568 --> 01:33:46.974]  economy to control Americans and to kill any populist or conservative media that could create its own ecosystem.
[01:33:46.974 --> 01:33:48.475]  That's why InfoWars are so precious.
[01:33:48.475 --> 01:33:54.779]  And Mike Lindell is just a great entrepreneur and a made-in-America patriot that solved problems and literally just
[01:33:56.053 --> 01:34:00.545]  Solve the history that was taking place and stood up for everybody.
[01:34:00.545 --> 01:34:03.734]  That's why it's so critical to understand the fight a war takes money.
[01:34:04.895 --> 01:34:08.776]  So if you just donated to myself or Mike Lindell, and we're fighting hard, that's a good thing.
[01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:18.678]  But with Mike, you get the great products made in America, it's employees in America, and then he's a fearless fighter, and he's a sponsor of InfoWars, a win-win.
[01:34:18.678 --> 01:34:20.419]  So go to MyPillow.com.
[01:34:20.419 --> 01:34:25.680]  He's not even asked me to do this, but I'm going to do it, because we need to sell these great products, and we need the funds, and you need them.
[01:34:26.656 --> 01:34:28.378]  These are high quality products.
[01:34:28.378 --> 01:34:29.600]  Hundreds and hundreds of them.
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.621]  Made in America.
[01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:34.305]  And then Mike puts almost all the money towards the fight against the tyrants.
[01:34:34.305 --> 01:34:34.906]  So do we.
[01:34:34.906 --> 01:34:36.829]  So go to MyPillow.com.
[01:34:36.829 --> 01:34:37.930]  Promo code Alex.
[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:40.033]  There is a huge sale going.
[01:34:40.033 --> 01:34:41.594]  Biggest bed sheet sale ever. $29.95.
[01:34:43.936 --> 01:34:46.718]  Biggest sheet sale, as low as $49.98.

[01:35:13.519 --> 01:35:15.761]  MyPillow blankets.
[01:35:15.761 --> 01:35:17.062]  Again, massively discounted.
[01:35:17.062 --> 01:35:19.363]  50% off.

[01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:00.953]  First, I want to do a correction, Alex, there.
[01:36:00.953 --> 01:36:04.977]  A lot of the stuff on MyPillow, you can't make here in the U.S.
[01:36:04.977 --> 01:36:08.901]  Like my Giza Dream Sheets, they don't have any weavers or spinners left.
[01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:14.547]  But I will say that if you go to mystore.com, you can also use the promo code, Alex.
[01:36:14.947 --> 01:36:18.309]  And that's all 100% made in the USA.

[01:36:22.272 --> 01:36:26.414]  You can use your promo code today, Alex, there for all these great entrepreneurs.
[01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:31.958]  We need to help them this time of year, too, because they've been getting canceled, attacked.
[01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:33.519]  I mean, this is everybody.
[01:36:33.519 --> 01:36:35.100]  And there it is right there, MyStore.

[01:36:52.849 --> 01:36:53.870]  A lot of it at MyPillow is.
[01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:57.211]  I know the geezer sheets are grown there and sewn there, but a lot of it is put together here.
[01:36:57.211 --> 01:37:02.354]  The point is, you're a major employer of the American people, and you're battling the globalists at point-blank range.
[01:37:02.354 --> 01:37:04.895]  MyStore.com, promo code Alex.
[01:37:04.895 --> 01:37:06.776]  Getting back to the election.
[01:37:06.776 --> 01:37:07.696]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:37:07.696 --> 01:37:11.838]  And I'm going to tell everybody, I'm going to give everybody a little hope here, too.
[01:37:11.838 --> 01:37:13.099]  I was down in Florida.
[01:37:13.935 --> 01:37:22.259]  And, uh, when I was there for the hurricanes, we were giving out pillows and blankets, my pillows, and, and, uh, we went into this Hispanic community.
[01:37:22.259 --> 01:37:23.399]  They lost everything.
[01:37:23.399 --> 01:37:24.220]  They're piled up.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:27.201]  All their physical stuff piled up like cordwood and it's gone.
[01:37:28.058 --> 01:37:30.780]  And a lot of them, we had to have an interpreter.
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:33.242]  And you know what they were saying?
[01:37:33.242 --> 01:37:40.848]  Unanimously, all of them were saying, Mike, is there this stuff going on in this country?
[01:37:40.848 --> 01:37:41.949]  Is there hope?
[01:37:41.949 --> 01:37:46.352]  They were worried about our future, Alex, their freedoms that they have here.
[01:37:46.352 --> 01:37:51.236]  They had just lost everything physical, but they know they're not going to get those physical things back.
[01:37:51.236 --> 01:37:53.017]  If we lose all our freedoms, it's over.
[01:37:53.692 --> 01:37:55.334]  And that's what we've been fighting for.
[01:37:55.334 --> 01:37:58.136]  And that's what we we are winning, everybody.
[01:37:58.136 --> 01:38:01.979]  And I want to tell everybody just to give a couple updates here.
[01:38:01.979 --> 01:38:04.161]  You got going down in Arizona right now.
[01:38:04.161 --> 01:38:06.823]  Everyone says, are we going to get the Senate?
[01:38:06.823 --> 01:38:07.624]  I believe we are.
[01:38:07.624 --> 01:38:11.427]  We've got Carrie Lake, Blake and Mark Fincham.
[01:38:11.427 --> 01:38:12.288]  They're all there.
[01:38:12.288 --> 01:38:14.430]  They're counting the same day votes now.
[01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:15.551]  Carrie Lake's only down by 13,000.
[01:38:16.972 --> 01:38:24.137]  She went down by a quarter million when they were doing the cheating ones, all the mail-in and all the early voting, and they're overtaking the algorithms.
[01:38:24.137 --> 01:38:27.739]  Everybody, they are overtaking the algorithms.
[01:38:27.739 --> 01:38:30.501]  All three of them, I believe, when carried for sure, 100%.
[01:38:30.501 --> 01:38:31.822]  That's key.
[01:38:31.822 --> 01:38:38.086]  For folks who don't know what overpowering the algorithm means is, a giant red wave, they can't stop it completely.
[01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:41.128]  Explain what overpowering or overtaking the algorithm means.
[01:38:41.528 --> 01:38:48.894]  So when you have the computers, when you're using computers and you set them, you set them to steal.
[01:38:48.894 --> 01:38:53.678]  So let's say, just like our great president, real president Donald Trump in 2020.
[01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.179]  They had these set.
[01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.561]  You have to have a base to begin with.
[01:38:57.561 --> 01:39:04.847]  You have to, you know, kind of do a prediction of what you think it will be, of how many votes will come in on the day of.
[01:39:04.847 --> 01:39:07.769]  And now you're taking, you can't make it look so obvious.
[01:39:08.249 --> 01:39:13.516]  You know, you can't make it look obvious, otherwise everyone would go, hey, there's a problem here.
[01:39:13.516 --> 01:39:19.943]  But when they do that, so they can only steal so much from a Cary Lake, like down there in Arizona.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:25.502]  And I'll give you a perfect example where the primaries were Carrie Lake.
[01:39:25.502 --> 01:39:27.523]  We told everybody to vote Day Up.
[01:39:27.523 --> 01:39:31.365]  Carrie Lake, remember, she was down by 10%, 11 o'clock at night.
[01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:34.247]  Then they started counting the Day Up votes in the primary.
[01:39:34.247 --> 01:39:36.408]  Remember, this was months ago.
[01:39:36.408 --> 01:39:41.551]  And she caught up and she was only down by 12, or up, then she was up by 12,000 votes.
[01:39:41.551 --> 01:39:43.232]  So what did Maricopa County do?
[01:39:43.232 --> 01:39:49.095]  They put the, they stopped the machine, stopped the counting, put the covers over the windows, put the fence up again.
[01:39:49.095 --> 01:39:50.576]  And we waited three days.
[01:39:51.276 --> 01:39:59.322]  Until they find there's nothing they could do because there was 90,000 votes left and the same day was coming in 75 carry 25 the opponent.
[01:39:59.322 --> 01:40:00.843]  So they had to give it to carry.
[01:40:00.843 --> 01:40:03.684]  It's identical to what's going on right now.
[01:40:03.684 --> 01:40:04.665]  There's about 400,000 votes left.
[01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:09.313]  And Kerry Lake's only down by 13.
[01:40:09.313 --> 01:40:17.361]  All the votes coming in for Blake, Mark, and Kerry are coming in at an 80%, 80-20 clip.
[01:40:17.361 --> 01:40:18.522]  So they're all going to win.
[01:40:18.522 --> 01:40:19.303]  I believe they're all going to win.
[01:40:19.303 --> 01:40:20.784]  Kerry's going to win for sure.
[01:40:20.784 --> 01:40:22.806]  And this is going on in other races too.
[01:40:22.806 --> 01:40:25.569]  In Nevada, Jim Marchant, the other...
[01:40:28.151 --> 01:40:30.172]  Senator that's there that's running for Senate.
[01:40:30.172 --> 01:40:32.053]  I can't think of the name right now.
[01:40:32.053 --> 01:40:33.213]  I got a mind block.
[01:40:33.213 --> 01:40:35.434]  But he's going to probably win.
[01:40:35.434 --> 01:40:38.535]  That gives us the Senate control, the Senate.
[01:40:38.535 --> 01:40:45.718]  And if just one of them win, if just Blake comes in, then we got to go to Hershel Walker for that runoff, which Hershel won going away.
[01:40:45.718 --> 01:40:48.559]  But they stole it, made it a runoff.
[01:40:48.559 --> 01:40:52.600]  And then also Lauren Boebert in Colorado.
[01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.561]  She's only down by 30 votes now.
[01:40:55.121 --> 01:41:00.428]  And so, what I mean, everybody, these are the real votes coming in, the day of votes.
[01:41:00.428 --> 01:41:04.933]  So, they overtook, they beat the machine steel, so to speak.
[01:41:04.933 --> 01:41:06.935]  Whatever they set, okay?
[01:41:06.935 --> 01:41:09.899]  It's pretty hard for them to do dumps, you know?
[01:41:10.828 --> 01:41:14.451]  Yeah, we gotta pray that Lauren, because she would be the bright spot of Colorado.
[01:41:14.451 --> 01:41:16.752]  They took everything in Colorado, everybody.
[01:41:16.752 --> 01:41:18.273]  They stole it all.
[01:41:18.273 --> 01:41:22.016]  Yeah, that just means she had such a landslide, she beat the algorithm if she wins.
[01:41:22.016 --> 01:41:29.402]  In fact, I've been watching today, she's been in the lead off and on, so this is like a buy-a-nose horse race right now.
[01:41:29.402 --> 01:41:30.963]  Right, right.
[01:41:30.963 --> 01:41:32.584]  It's kind of like, I mean,
[01:41:34.175 --> 01:41:36.256]  And by the way, I'm going to tell everybody this too.
[01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:43.241]  Realize the candidates, the ones that they have taken, most of them out there aren't going to concede.
[01:41:43.241 --> 01:41:49.485]  They have more rights, you think, than to do audits, and they won't be able to kick them out for standing.
[01:41:49.485 --> 01:41:56.649]  So I believe what's going to happen, Alex, we're going to get the House and Senate, I believe, control, and that'll slow the destruction.
[01:41:56.649 --> 01:42:00.172]  And we're going to get this country back by the judges, everybody.
[01:42:00.752 --> 01:42:09.558]  We've got so many sheriffs out there that are going to be bringing this, all the evidence of what happened in this election, to the judges and cases and court cases.
[01:42:09.558 --> 01:42:21.126]  Remember, no judge in the United States has looked at any evidence from 2020, or for that matter, any of these elections, even in the primaries, because they kicked the can on something called standing.
[01:42:21.126 --> 01:42:24.449]  It's just an easy way for a judge to say, I don't want to see that.
[01:42:24.449 --> 01:42:25.930]  We've got to pray for our judges.
[01:42:25.930 --> 01:42:27.271]  If you know a judge out there,
[01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:30.813]  And your family or your friend is a judge?
[01:42:30.813 --> 01:42:35.817]  Just encourage them to say, just have courage to be the judge that God put you here to be.
[01:42:35.817 --> 01:42:36.498]  Be a judge!
[01:42:36.498 --> 01:42:37.339]  Here's an example.
[01:42:37.339 --> 01:42:42.543]  It's like the district attorney, Frank Gerson, exposed the whole Kennedy thing because one district attorney did the right thing.
[01:42:42.543 --> 01:42:44.224]  That's why Soros has been trying to buy him off.
[01:42:44.224 --> 01:42:49.248]  When we come back, what's coming next, other big developments, your deep research from two years ago.
[01:42:59.207 --> 01:43:02.050]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:04.092]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[01:43:04.092 --> 01:43:06.094]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[01:43:06.094 --> 01:43:08.156]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[01:43:08.156 --> 01:43:09.877]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:09.877 --> 01:43:12.279]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[01:43:12.279 --> 01:43:13.701]  You forget to take DX3.
[01:43:13.701 --> 01:43:15.202]  And you know it makes your life better.
[01:43:15.202 --> 01:43:16.664]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[01:43:16.664 --> 01:43:17.825]  And you constantly forget.
[01:43:17.825 --> 01:43:19.787]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[01:43:20.447 --> 01:43:23.409]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[01:44:44.376 --> 01:44:48.600]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:56.006]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[01:44:57.848 --> 01:45:02.733]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:45:02.733 --> 01:45:09.138]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:45:09.138 --> 01:45:14.283]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:45:14.283 --> 01:45:15.984]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:45:15.984 --> 01:45:17.305]  Yes, I've persevered.
[01:45:17.305 --> 01:45:22.410]  But the listeners and viewers who support Infowars are the real reason we've had the success.
[01:45:23.110 --> 01:45:28.551]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:45:28.551 --> 01:45:32.872]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:45:32.872 --> 01:45:41.794]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:45:41.794 --> 01:45:43.454]  God bless you all.
[01:45:43.454 --> 01:45:44.495]  I salute you.
[01:45:44.495 --> 01:45:45.595]  I thank you.
[01:45:45.595 --> 01:45:50.936]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:45:51.616 --> 01:45:52.936]  The fight is my fight.
[01:45:52.936 --> 01:45:53.577]  It's your fight.
[01:45:53.577 --> 01:45:54.317]  It's our fight.
[01:45:54.317 --> 01:45:56.378]  God bless you all.
[01:45:56.378 --> 01:46:07.701]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:46:07.701 --> 01:46:09.582]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:46:09.582 --> 01:46:11.042]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:46:11.042 --> 01:46:12.583]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:46:12.583 --> 01:46:14.263]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:46:14.263 --> 01:46:15.543]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:46:15.543 --> 01:46:16.944]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:46:17.364 --> 01:46:22.208]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:46:22.208 --> 01:46:24.610]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:46:24.610 --> 01:46:26.612]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:46:26.612 --> 01:46:33.558]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalists' agenda.
[01:46:34.198 --> 01:46:39.603]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:46:39.603 --> 01:46:48.531]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:46:48.531 --> 01:46:54.817]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:46:58.351 --> 01:47:06.534]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.534 --> 01:47:15.557]  Yeah, okay, so with that being said, with the exposure, once that's lifted, now this should get rid of all the lawfare.
[01:47:15.557 --> 01:47:18.518]  It'll get rid of the lawfare, it'll get rid of this.
[01:47:18.518 --> 01:47:22.879]  Remember, lawfare has not been used in our country since 1798.
[01:47:22.879 --> 01:47:24.160]  It's horrible what they did.
[01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.741]  And who started that?
[01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:27.103]  Smartmatic did.
[01:47:27.103 --> 01:47:33.409]  When Smartmatic sued Fox News on February 4th of 2021, our voices got silent.
[01:47:33.409 --> 01:47:40.696]  Because Fox wouldn't talk, nobody will have anybody on to talk about the election crime, including 2,000 meals.
[01:47:40.696 --> 01:47:41.998]  And that wasn't even machines.
[01:47:42.518 --> 01:47:46.041]  So you have, you got your Newsmax's of the world, your Fox's of the world.
[01:47:46.041 --> 01:47:51.445]  Well, no, they can't talk about election crime or machines or anything like that.
[01:47:51.445 --> 01:47:52.806]  It's disgusting.
[01:47:52.806 --> 01:47:56.369]  And then, so they, they are either afraid of being sued.
[01:47:56.369 --> 01:47:59.611]  Well, once you sued Fox News, everybody was afraid, right?
[01:47:59.611 --> 01:48:11.941]  And, um, which, uh, that's a whole nother story about Fox News, but, but anyway, so this law fair now when with, and then all these lawsuits, remember these machine companies, I want them rhymes with the word dominion.
[01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:16.484]  They've sued over 200 people or sent them threatening letters.
[01:48:16.484 --> 01:48:19.586]  A lot of these citizens had to go get home security systems.
[01:48:19.586 --> 01:48:21.928]  These were like mafia letters sent to them.
[01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:32.815]  Well, these citizens, like nobody hears about in Michigan, like these citizens did a class action lawsuit against Dominion with Alan Dershowitz, one of the lawyers, and going, hey, this is wrong.
[01:48:32.815 --> 01:48:34.056]  You can't do this.
[01:48:34.056 --> 01:48:35.017]  We did nothing wrong.
[01:48:35.017 --> 01:48:36.218]  Nobody's done anything wrong.
[01:48:36.218 --> 01:48:39.120]  We're speaking out against something that everybody's seen and knows.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:51.469]  And so what's happening, Mike Lindell, because even last week before the election Politico and a bunch of others wrote articles admitting machines are hackable and are being hacked and saying everything you said, everything I've been reporting for 28 years.
[01:48:51.469 --> 01:48:52.750]  I mean, so, so, so, so.
[01:48:52.750 --> 01:49:03.578]  Oh yeah, for Charlie, Charlie Vindican, you guys, I did a, I was down at a, I was down at a Senate hearing or hearing down in Louisiana a couple months ago and all the machine companies were there.
[01:49:03.578 --> 01:49:04.438]  Well, here's the ES&S.
[01:49:05.459 --> 01:49:09.542]  They're one of the biggest ones in the country, if not the biggest, out of Omaha, Nebraska.
[01:49:09.542 --> 01:49:22.070]  One of their owners was there, and he comes up and he goes, the great Secretary of State, Kyle Ardenwein, asked him straight out, he said, are your machines hackable and vulnerable?
[01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:23.491]  And at least he didn't lie.
[01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:26.934]  He said, yes they are, but all machines are.
[01:49:26.934 --> 01:49:28.515]  All voting machines are.
[01:49:28.515 --> 01:49:29.075]  End quote.
[01:49:30.776 --> 01:49:35.681]  With these guys, they tried to paint themselves that they're not Dominion and Smartmatic.
[01:49:35.681 --> 01:49:42.087]  We're the hometown boys from Omaha, Nebraska, but our parts are made in China.
[01:49:42.087 --> 01:49:44.770]  Our software, it's all the same software.
[01:49:44.770 --> 01:49:46.612]  It's all corruption.
[01:49:46.612 --> 01:49:49.995]  And then, Alex, you'll like this, so they let me talk for 24 minutes.
[01:49:51.216 --> 01:50:01.642]  And the one gal up there at the committee, she says, Mr. Lindell, in our state here, we'd rather not use paper to save the trees and stuff.
[01:50:01.642 --> 01:50:04.964]  I said, well ma'am, we're going to recycle too.
[01:50:04.964 --> 01:50:09.027]  We're going to take these machines, melt them down, and turn them into prison bars.
[01:50:09.027 --> 01:50:09.547]  End quote.
[01:50:10.928 --> 01:50:11.729]  I love it.
[01:50:11.729 --> 01:50:14.754]  I want to bring Owen Schroer here and a bunch of other key points you've got.
[01:50:14.754 --> 01:50:16.637]  We're very blessed to have you for the full hour.
[01:50:16.637 --> 01:50:21.704]  Owen Schroer has been our election expert here, been following your work, and he's got a few questions and comments.
[01:50:21.704 --> 01:50:23.207]  Owen Schroer on the air with Mike Lindell.
[01:50:24.437 --> 01:50:30.204]  Yeah, Mike, you're doing such great work monitoring all of these races and all the trends going on across the country.
[01:50:30.204 --> 01:50:31.886]  It's really an amazing team you've assembled.
[01:50:31.886 --> 01:50:42.138]  But I'm curious, what are you noticing in these inner cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, where Democrats are getting 70, 80, sometimes 90 percent of the vote?
[01:50:45.001 --> 01:50:46.723]  What do you think the story there is?
[01:50:46.723 --> 01:50:50.267]  I mean, are Democrats really that popular in the cities they destroyed?
[01:50:50.267 --> 01:50:59.137]  Or is your team noticing maybe some shenanigans that are getting these huge numbers for Democrats that end up in Senate races overwhelming the state's desires?
[01:51:00.256 --> 01:51:03.721]  Right, well, all you have to do is look at Florida.
[01:51:03.721 --> 01:51:14.535]  Like I said earlier in the show, Florida, they put in stuff there to at least slow the steel to a crawl, and you just had a governor there, I mean, and get
[01:51:15.376 --> 01:51:15.616]  We're good.
[01:51:37.615 --> 01:51:43.461]  No, I was out in California for a week about two months ago, and you could all look it up.
[01:51:43.461 --> 01:51:45.163]  Mike Lindell, California.
[01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:51.769]  And I was in a town, they were all very Democrat and liberal, and the average age was probably 30.
[01:51:51.769 --> 01:51:55.333]  But they all came up to me, all of them were friendly and they were concerned.
[01:51:55.333 --> 01:51:57.035]  Their gas was $7.30.
[01:51:57.035 --> 01:51:59.497]  They weren't going to vote Democrat anymore.
[01:51:59.537 --> 01:52:04.160]  By the way, Mike, that's what I've seen where I live with liberals that are awake now.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:11.125]  That's what the CNN exit polls predicted, a mass Republican victory, because 70 plus percent of Democrats said, we blame Biden, we're going to vote Republican.
[01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:16.889]  But the exit polls now are completely wrong, though historically they've always been extremely accurate.
[01:52:16.889 --> 01:52:17.490]  So I think it's clear.
[01:52:17.970 --> 01:52:20.773]  Big city, deep blue, Democrat cities.
[01:52:20.773 --> 01:52:25.478]  Chicago's famous for it on record, you know, stealing it back in the 60s.
[01:52:25.478 --> 01:52:38.172]  They are engaged in massive fraud there, and I think they're just overdoing it in those areas to get up the overall averages for the rest of the state in these statewide and congressional and presidential elections.
[01:52:38.172 --> 01:52:38.653]  What do you think?
[01:52:39.775 --> 01:52:41.117]  Well, absolutely.
[01:52:41.117 --> 01:52:42.499]  It's been ever the public.
[01:52:42.499 --> 01:52:49.468]  Remember, when they use these computers and stuff, they don't want to make a deviation seem too out of hand.
[01:52:49.468 --> 01:52:54.535]  Well, if you got the public convinced that everybody loves the inner city, they're all going to vote Democrat.
[01:52:54.995 --> 01:52:56.276]  That's a big lie.
[01:52:56.276 --> 01:52:57.856]  That is a big lie.
[01:52:57.856 --> 01:53:03.398]  Remember, in the 2020 election, the most votes sold against Donald Trump was California.
[01:53:03.398 --> 01:53:05.379]  Minimum 1.5 million.
[01:53:05.379 --> 01:53:11.080]  Second most in the country was Texas at 1 million, and third was Florida at 950,000.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:18.423]  So, what they did, and you say, well, why would they take from a Republican state like Alabama or Ohio?
[01:53:18.943 --> 01:53:19.884]  Well, here's why.
[01:53:19.884 --> 01:53:22.147]  I'll give everybody an example.
[01:53:22.147 --> 01:53:29.956]  Let's say I told you that in my home state of Minnesota that Donald Trump won $2 million to Biden's $100,000.
[01:53:29.956 --> 01:53:33.220]  Everyone would say, um, that's a computer error.
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:34.442]  There's something wrong.
[01:53:35.103 --> 01:53:40.847]  So, you have to make it look, you have to boil the whole ocean, so to speak.
[01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:48.152]  So you can look at those inner cities and say, we can take more there because people will believe it's all Democrat.
[01:53:48.152 --> 01:53:57.538]  Or you can go to Republican area and say, it's so overwhelming, 80% is going to be Republican, that you go, hey, we can take 10% off the top there.
[01:53:57.538 --> 01:53:58.859]  It's like skimming.
[01:53:58.859 --> 01:54:02.602]  If you had a massive casino or something, you're skimming off the top.
[01:54:02.602 --> 01:54:03.302]  Perfectly said.
[01:54:04.861 --> 01:54:06.108]  Perfectly said.
[01:54:06.108 --> 01:54:06.851]  Owen, another question?
[01:54:08.359 --> 01:54:29.738]  Well Mike, we were all concerned in Nevada that it was going to be Clark County, that's Las Vegas, where the Democrats are going to be up to shenanigans and tricks and maybe that's how they were going to try to pull off an election victory in the Senate, but we've been watching Clark County and it really hasn't seemed too anomalous as far as the numbers coming in, but then overnight it was Reno!
[01:54:29.738 --> 01:54:34.563]  It was Washaw County that magically 60% of all the recent ballot dumps
[01:54:35.163 --> 01:54:40.928]  ...are coming in for the Democrat, Mastow, where it used to be 60% for Laxalt.
[01:54:40.928 --> 01:54:45.131]  Are you guys watching, uh, Washaw County, Nevada right now?
[01:54:45.131 --> 01:54:46.732]  Are you guys seeing these anomalies?
[01:54:46.732 --> 01:54:49.094]  Do you think that's where they're gonna try to steal this Senate seat?
[01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:57.075]  Well, I have not talked to him about Nevada, but I will say this.
[01:54:57.075 --> 01:55:01.498]  I think you need to look more at what votes are they counting.
[01:55:01.498 --> 01:55:04.259]  I believe they counted all the early votes.
[01:55:04.259 --> 01:55:12.625]  Remember, I said that's where most of the steel goes in these early voting and before the same day voting.
[01:55:12.625 --> 01:55:19.450]  So if they're counting in Nevada, I don't care if it's Clark County, Reno, wherever it is, if those people voted day of,
[01:55:20.373 --> 01:55:23.976]  I believe that you're going to have a big win in the Senate there.
[01:55:39.602 --> 01:55:48.852]  Yeah, I would just like to tell everyone, it's absolutely awesome that the way things are just laid out here, from these little mini miracles.
[01:55:48.852 --> 01:55:56.800]  Remember, we had all this machine problems, malfunctioning across our whole country, which made national and international news.
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:55:59.803]  That's huge for what we have to do in the future to get rid of them.
[01:56:00.323 --> 01:56:05.808]  And then we had, we're going to get the House, we're going to get the Senate, I believe we're going to get that.
[01:56:05.808 --> 01:56:11.774]  And then you're going to see Kerry Lake and all them, Kerry Lake and Mark Fincham win in Arizona.
[01:56:11.774 --> 01:56:13.015]  That's the gateway.
[01:56:13.015 --> 01:56:14.497]  That'll be the prototype.
[01:56:14.497 --> 01:56:19.902]  The first thing they're going to do is say, we got these machines got to go, and then it'll spread across our country.
[01:56:20.382 --> 01:56:26.347]  We're going to look back and we're going to say, when we get to this great place we're going, God had his hand in all of this.
[01:56:26.347 --> 01:56:37.295]  And if you look back, everything had to happen just the way it did, and with everybody having patience, because even the bad stuff is making people pour into the nonsense.
[01:56:37.295 --> 01:56:37.936]  Exactly.
[01:56:37.936 --> 01:56:39.978]  As long as we don't give up, they lose.
[01:56:39.978 --> 01:56:42.580]  And over time, we're out of the boiling frog pot.
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:43.080]  We're awake now.
[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:44.601]  Now we know we're under attack.
[01:56:44.601 --> 01:56:47.384]  We're getting stronger every day the longer we continue to fight.

[01:58:56.561 --> 01:59:01.463]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:59:01.463 --> 01:59:05.005]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:59:05.005 --> 01:59:05.846]  It's game over.
[01:59:05.846 --> 01:59:11.548]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:59:11.548 --> 01:59:16.151]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[01:59:52.544 --> 01:59:53.846]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:10.373 --> 02:00:13.936]  Alright, Owen Schroyer is always kicking ass, host of the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:00:13.936 --> 02:00:14.737]  Central.
[02:00:14.737 --> 02:00:17.019]  He's got a lot of other breaking news and points to make.
[02:00:17.019 --> 02:00:22.164]  He's hosting this five minutes, and I'm coming back, and I'm opening the phones up for the balance of the hour.
[02:00:22.164 --> 02:00:24.206]  Owen Schroyer.
[02:00:24.206 --> 02:00:28.690]  So, ladies and gentlemen, here's where we're at as far as the Senate is concerned.
[02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:36.356]  Republicans have to win, either Nevada or Arizona, otherwise the runoff in Georgia is really going to be for Senate.
[02:00:37.177 --> 02:00:41.300]  And a 50-50 split really gives Democrats control.
[02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:44.242]  You do have Joe Manchin who's kind of a stopgap.
[02:00:44.242 --> 02:00:45.883]  I think he'll be overwhelmed.
[02:00:45.883 --> 02:00:50.626]  And so Republicans need either Arizona or Nevada.
[02:00:50.626 --> 02:00:53.248]  Now if they get both, that's huge.
[02:00:53.248 --> 02:01:00.173]  Now you're not just a clear majority, you even got a chance for 52 with that Georgia runoff that's certainly going to be a bloodbath.
[02:01:00.173 --> 02:01:02.434]  But I'll be covering more of that coming up later.
[02:01:02.434 --> 02:01:05.917]  But when we focus on Arizona,
[02:01:06.576 --> 02:01:08.417]  The shenanigans are going to be in question.
[02:01:08.417 --> 02:01:10.517]  What happened in Maricopa County?
[02:01:10.517 --> 02:01:12.698]  The machines are going to be in question.
[02:01:12.698 --> 02:01:15.559]  Masters and Lake are both still extremely confident.
[02:01:15.559 --> 02:01:19.400]  I do think Lake will overcome and eventually be declared the winner.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:25.861]  But remember, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who's running against her, is the one in charge of counting the ballots.
[02:01:25.861 --> 02:01:27.422]  What did Stalin say?
[02:01:27.422 --> 02:01:31.523]  It's not how the ballots are counted, it's who's counting them.
[02:01:31.523 --> 02:01:34.044]  So, very suspicious there for Arizona.
[02:01:34.764 --> 02:01:39.567]  The good news is, no matter what happens, I think the Republicans there are fighters.
[02:01:39.567 --> 02:01:42.729]  I don't think they're going to let a loss go easily.
[02:01:42.729 --> 02:01:44.130]  I think there'll be audits.
[02:01:44.130 --> 02:01:45.631]  I think there'll be lawsuits.
[02:01:45.631 --> 02:01:55.538]  And I think that the Arizona conservative, populist, Republican movement has the spine, has the backbone, has the will to try to save that state from the corruption.
[02:01:55.538 --> 02:01:58.220]  Now, we jump up to Nevada.
[02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:00.161]  This is the big developing story now.
[02:02:02.703 --> 02:02:08.695]  Reno, Waushaw County, where the new ballot dumps coming in are going 60% Democrat.
[02:02:11.668 --> 02:02:20.455]  All the last, I guess we're on day three, election day three, what am I going to be up here, day 40 with a long beard and gray hair?
[02:02:20.455 --> 02:02:21.936]  Election day three!
[02:02:21.936 --> 02:02:34.967]  So now on election day three, all of a sudden the trend in Washaw County here is Democrat, and Masto, who's been losing the entire race, has now overcome and has more votes than Laxalt in Washaw County.
[02:02:35.407 --> 02:02:41.396]  We thought it was going to be Clark County down here in Las Vegas, where we were going to have to watch out for some shenanigans.
[02:02:41.396 --> 02:02:48.566]  Looks like it might be Reno, looks like it might be Waukesha County, so we'll be watching that closely as the votes slowly, slowly start to trickle in.
[02:02:50.089 --> 02:03:09.924]  I do still believe that Laxalt will win this state, but I think they're going to make it interesting, depending on how desperate and committed they are, they're either going to keep counting ballots in Waushaw County until the Democrat is ahead, or eventually they're just going to say, okay, this is enough, it's time to call it for Laxalt.
[02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:13.367]  So that should be determined by the weekend.
[02:03:13.647 --> 02:03:18.952]  I think we'll have an idea or a conclusion on Nevada by the end of the weekend.
[02:03:18.952 --> 02:03:27.379]  Now, a couple other races that we're watching right now, obviously Lauren Boebert, I do think that she's going to save that seat of hers in the house.
[02:03:27.379 --> 02:03:34.325]  In fact, latest numbers, okay, I don't think we have any new numbers, Boebert literally up by about 400 votes.
[02:03:37.026 --> 02:03:38.707]  Wow!
[02:03:38.707 --> 02:03:41.389]  Now, people are saying that's hard to believe.
[02:03:41.389 --> 02:03:53.818]  I can understand why some people might not like Lauren Boebert, but this is a very conservative area, and for the Democrat there to be making it close with an incumbent who's pretty popular, Lauren Boebert, is interesting.
[02:03:53.818 --> 02:03:57.340]  But nonetheless, if she takes it, I don't think there will be any questions asked.
[02:03:57.340 --> 02:03:58.181]  They'll take that seat.
[02:03:58.181 --> 02:04:03.625]  And then, you know, I just want to quickly, let's go over to the Speaker of the House, shall we?
[02:04:03.625 --> 02:04:05.166]  Let's look at Nancy Pelosi.
[02:04:06.084 --> 02:04:09.507]  She's about to lose the gavel, thank God.
[02:04:09.507 --> 02:04:15.772]  But you know, Nancy Pelosi must be pretty popular, guys, because she is dominating her district.
[02:04:15.772 --> 02:04:19.776]  So I guess the people... It's easier if you go over here, guys, and just scroll down.
[02:04:19.776 --> 02:04:21.858]  It'll be easier to find it, because her district is so small.
[02:04:22.577 --> 02:04:26.738]  So, the people of San Francisco love Nancy Pelosi so much.
[02:04:26.738 --> 02:04:31.880]  I believe she got, yes, there it is, 81% of the vote.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:35.822]  They just love Nancy Pelosi for 70 years.
[02:04:35.822 --> 02:04:41.183]  For 70 years, Nancy Pelosi in the district, 11th district of California, San Francisco.
[02:04:41.183 --> 02:04:42.484]  And you look at what's happened.
[02:04:43.244 --> 02:04:50.395]  In those 70 years that Pelosi has been in office, obviously great things have happened to San Francisco.
[02:04:50.395 --> 02:04:53.360]  The defecation on the street, the homelessness, the poverty, the crime.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:54.762]  Way to go, San Francisco!
[02:04:54.762 --> 02:04:55.243]  Good job!
[02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:04.712]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:05:04.712 --> 02:05:16.318]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:05:16.318 --> 02:05:23.182]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists' number
[02:05:23.602 --> 02:05:28.605]  We know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[02:05:28.605 --> 02:05:35.810]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.

[02:06:05.190 --> 02:06:08.552]  In the age of wonder.
[02:06:08.552 --> 02:06:12.475]  In the age of wonder.
[02:06:12.475 --> 02:06:13.255]  Another world.
[02:06:13.255 --> 02:06:14.996]  Another time.
[02:06:14.996 --> 02:06:15.717]  Another time.
[02:06:18.978 --> 02:06:28.542]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:28.542 --> 02:06:34.845]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:34.845 --> 02:06:37.906]  Atlantis blew up!
[02:06:37.906 --> 02:06:41.508]  Well, they believe in what Plato wrote about and said was real.
[02:06:41.508 --> 02:06:43.829]  They found almost everything else he said was real.
[02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:46.270]  He was a historian, not just the father of philosophy.
[02:06:48.493 --> 02:06:59.718]  That Atlantis was real, but whether it was real or not, we are at that Atlantean moment with God-like power, but not a God-like brain or soul, on the verge of destroying ourselves.
[02:06:59.718 --> 02:07:01.778]  I want to play a clip here, and get Owen Shorter's take on this.
[02:07:01.778 --> 02:07:04.500]  I'm going to let Owen get ready for his own show, The War Room, at 3 p.m.
[02:07:04.500 --> 02:07:05.120]  Central.
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:07.901]  I'm going to open the phones up and take your calls on the election.
[02:07:07.901 --> 02:07:10.862]  That one topic, first-time callers.
[02:07:10.862 --> 02:07:12.523]  You don't screen calls, I do it on air.
[02:07:12.523 --> 02:07:17.285]  Sometimes I say, usually it's a free-for-all, 90% of the time, but 10% of the time I say, I want you on this one topic.
[02:07:18.271 --> 02:07:18.791]  Humor me!
[02:07:18.791 --> 02:07:19.452]  It's a big deal.
[02:07:19.452 --> 02:07:20.212]  What do you think?
[02:07:20.212 --> 02:07:20.813]  What did you witness?
[02:07:20.813 --> 02:07:21.633]  What did you see?
[02:07:21.633 --> 02:07:22.754]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[02:07:22.754 --> 02:07:22.994]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:22.994 --> 02:07:23.275]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[02:07:23.275 --> 02:07:24.235]  First-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[02:07:24.235 --> 02:07:26.117]  But, we've got this clip, and it wasn't just MSNBC, it was CNN.
[02:07:26.117 --> 02:07:27.297]  It's everywhere, like Beto.
[02:07:27.297 --> 02:07:29.059]  They picked the weirdest, fakest people
[02:07:45.859 --> 02:07:49.761]  And make them into celebrities, and the Democrats have such a horrible field.
[02:07:49.761 --> 02:07:51.562]  I mean, their best is Gavin Newsom.
[02:07:51.562 --> 02:07:59.465]  Literally looks more like American Psycho, and acts like more than American Psycho, than Christian Bale in that seminal film.
[02:07:59.465 --> 02:08:02.647]  And so now they're saying, oh, he's so wonderful, like Avenatti.
[02:08:02.647 --> 02:08:04.267]  Oh, he's going to run for president.
[02:08:04.267 --> 02:08:06.268]  Oh, oh, oh, Fetterman!
[02:08:06.268 --> 02:08:08.069]  Oh, Fetterman, oh, we love him!
[02:08:08.069 --> 02:08:09.810]  And I feel sorry for Fetterman.
[02:08:09.810 --> 02:08:12.251]  He's this big, demonic, evil mutant.
[02:08:13.749 --> 02:08:19.873]  Who literally can't talk, and that's the perfect thing, I guess, for the fourth administration of Biden, with election fraud.
[02:08:19.873 --> 02:08:20.633]  It's a sick joke.
[02:08:20.633 --> 02:08:23.835]  We'll have Fetterman be like, hey, hold on, I have brain jam.
[02:08:23.835 --> 02:08:25.015]  What I do?
[02:08:25.015 --> 02:08:26.096]  Obama.
[02:08:26.096 --> 02:08:28.377]  Obama say I take a gun.
[02:08:28.377 --> 02:08:30.419]  I Fetterman.
[02:08:30.419 --> 02:08:31.879]  I am Fetterman.
[02:08:31.879 --> 02:08:33.340]  I bomb people.
[02:08:33.340 --> 02:08:35.682]  What you take part, you know.
[02:08:35.682 --> 02:08:37.743]  I mean, here's the clip.
[02:08:38.988 --> 02:08:48.258]  Setterman as a nominee at some point for president, I know there's some variables obviously.
[02:08:48.258 --> 02:08:50.420]  Just a few.
[02:08:50.420 --> 02:09:00.831]  What he did in the super red, deep red parts of Pennsylvania and the way that he ran ahead of Biden as you were saying, ran ahead of Trump, I mean it just makes you wonder about his future.
[02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:04.430]  And they go on to talk about him for president.
[02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:06.191]  I've got all the articles right here.
[02:09:06.191 --> 02:09:11.552]  The Democrats already floating the idea of a Fetterman presidential run red state.
[02:09:11.552 --> 02:09:18.193]  Oh, and I see you laughing, but I mean, I guess the electronic voting machines could elect a tomato or a potato here.
[02:09:18.193 --> 02:09:19.773]  It'd be better than this guy.
[02:09:19.773 --> 02:09:21.113]  Oh, I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:09:21.113 --> 02:09:22.674]  I'm not prepared.
[02:09:22.674 --> 02:09:24.254]  I've probably seen that clip.
[02:09:24.254 --> 02:09:24.774]  I'm not even kidding.
[02:09:24.774 --> 02:09:26.454]  I have tears of laughter.
[02:09:26.454 --> 02:09:30.735]  I've probably seen that clip at least 20 times, and it still gets me every time, Alex, because
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:46.211]  Katie Turr, sitting at the desk, you notice she's got this smug, arrogant, like, Cheshire Cat, like she thinks she's got the greatest idea ever, and she crosses her arms and leans back in the chair like, well, you know, I'll be the first to suggest Fetterman for president.
[02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:51.436]  It reminds me of that guy's pull-up skelter saying that Avenatti's going to be the next president.
[02:09:51.436 --> 02:09:52.737]  I mean, it's that ridiculous.
[02:09:53.783 --> 02:09:56.325]  Yeah, I think he might be in jail right now.
[02:09:56.325 --> 02:09:57.485]  I don't know what happened to Avenatti.
[02:09:57.485 --> 02:09:58.926]  He was all over the map.
[02:09:58.926 --> 02:10:04.069]  But, okay, yeah, Katie Turr arrogantly smug like, ooh, like, I think Fetterman, uh-huh.
[02:10:04.069 --> 02:10:05.931]  But did you hear what she said?
[02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:08.592]  She goes, I know there's some variables.
[02:10:08.592 --> 02:10:10.293]  Some variables?
[02:10:10.293 --> 02:10:11.234]  Some variables what?
[02:10:11.234 --> 02:10:12.254]  That he can't think?
[02:10:12.254 --> 02:10:13.735]  He can't talk?
[02:10:13.735 --> 02:10:16.557]  He's mentally deranged and disturbed disabled?
[02:10:16.557 --> 02:10:19.219]  And you've got Alan Greenspan's wife up there looking at her like she's crazy.
[02:10:20.475 --> 02:10:22.276]  Variables, Alex!
[02:10:22.276 --> 02:10:24.236]  She says variables!
[02:10:24.236 --> 02:10:26.837]  I'd love to know what variables she's talking about.
[02:10:26.837 --> 02:10:34.420]  You know, most people think Fetterman is not even going to last but maybe a couple months and he's just going to hand the seat down to his wife.
[02:10:35.413 --> 02:10:41.476]  And if they're acting like he's going to recover from the stroke, folks, he's already reached the time of full recovery on average.
[02:10:41.476 --> 02:10:45.337]  He's past the point of having any more recovery.
[02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:47.118]  And so this is Fetterman now.
[02:10:47.118 --> 02:10:47.939]  And look, it's sad.
[02:10:47.939 --> 02:10:49.659]  I mean, you know, he's got a family, whatever.
[02:10:49.659 --> 02:10:50.139]  It's sad.
[02:10:50.139 --> 02:10:52.861]  This is the trend of vegetable Democrats.
[02:10:52.861 --> 02:10:54.521]  Why do you think they choose vegetables?
[02:10:54.521 --> 02:10:55.642]  Because they're the perfect puppet?
[02:10:58.035 --> 02:11:14.945]  Alex, you know, it's hard to even try to get into the mind of a Democrat, and you kind of have to go with these prerequisites that everything that they do comes from a psychological perspective of they want to gaslight you, they want to pee on you and tell you it's raining.
[02:11:15.545 --> 02:11:20.646]  They want to give you a crap sandwich and tell you it's filet mignon.
[02:11:20.646 --> 02:11:23.446]  I mean, so there's just that energy, there's that direction.
[02:11:23.446 --> 02:11:26.927]  It's kind of a domination thing over you that they can abuse you.
[02:11:26.927 --> 02:11:29.267]  It's kind of an abuser-predator tactic.
[02:11:29.267 --> 02:11:31.428]  And so that's just the Democrat psychology.
[02:11:31.428 --> 02:11:34.808]  I mean, even Katie Turr has to admit, oh, I know there's variables.
[02:11:34.808 --> 02:11:35.848]  What variables, Katie?
[02:11:35.848 --> 02:11:40.949]  That you're putting up a mentally ill, a mentally incompetent person?
[02:11:40.949 --> 02:11:44.070]  Is that the variable that you're sitting up there talking about?
[02:11:44.070 --> 02:11:44.930]  Yeah, we all know it.
[02:11:45.690 --> 02:11:48.891]  And then they go along and just lie to you.
[02:11:48.891 --> 02:11:52.052]  Oh, Fetterman did so well in these deep red areas.
[02:11:52.052 --> 02:11:58.975]  See, now what they're trying to do is... This is how Glenn Young can actually... It's their psychological operation.
[02:11:58.975 --> 02:12:02.936]  We're not just going to steal traditional Democrat areas where there's a red wave.
[02:12:02.936 --> 02:12:05.237]  Now we're going to take deep red areas.
[02:12:07.042 --> 02:12:08.203]  But it wasn't even true!
[02:12:08.203 --> 02:12:10.004]  That's not even true!
[02:12:10.004 --> 02:12:19.711]  That's what Republicans need to tap into and realize is the only way they can overwhelm the voter fraud in the inner cities is to go out into the deep red areas and get massive voter turnout.
[02:12:19.711 --> 02:12:25.415]  That was one of the reasons why Yunkin was able to win Virginia and really change the state's politics.
[02:12:25.415 --> 02:12:30.638]  So really, the Republicans need to be heeding that message and they need to be out in the deep red areas.
[02:12:30.638 --> 02:12:32.940]  They need to be doubling the vote total in the deep red areas.
[02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:34.001]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:12:34.001 --> 02:12:35.442]  They clearly stole key areas.
[02:12:35.982 --> 02:12:38.484]  But a big part of this was like the Q effect.
[02:12:38.484 --> 02:12:40.365]  Oh Q, we're all going to win, we're invincible.
[02:12:40.365 --> 02:12:42.146]  And I knew it was a fraud.
[02:12:42.146 --> 02:12:45.768]  And then a lot of people just thought Trump was invincible because of the Q thing and didn't even vote.
[02:12:45.768 --> 02:12:51.552]  Even though they stole it from Trump, they couldn't have stole it if it was overpowered the algorithm.
[02:12:51.552 --> 02:12:52.953]  That's what the science shows.
[02:12:52.953 --> 02:12:53.633]  It's the same thing.
[02:12:53.633 --> 02:12:54.654]  Oh, we're going to win.
[02:12:54.654 --> 02:12:56.855]  A bunch of conservatives I knew didn't even vote.
[02:12:56.855 --> 02:12:58.656]  Oh, we're about to totally win.
[02:12:58.656 --> 02:13:00.578]  And again, the media told you that.
[02:13:00.578 --> 02:13:00.878]  Stop.
[02:13:01.198 --> 02:13:02.960]  Taking stuff for granted.
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:05.582]  Owen Schroyer, 3pm Central, The War Room.
[02:13:05.582 --> 02:13:06.984]  You'll be covering the latest developments.
[02:13:06.984 --> 02:13:08.445]  Thank you.
[02:13:08.445 --> 02:13:09.186]  Alright Alex, thank you.
[02:13:09.186 --> 02:13:11.348]  Looking forward to big breaking news at 3 o'clock.
[02:13:11.348 --> 02:13:13.109]  Alright.
[02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:16.753]  Here's some big breaking news, an exclusive response to it.
[02:13:16.753 --> 02:13:20.737]  And I want to go to your phone call, so I don't want to spend a lot of time on this.
[02:13:20.737 --> 02:13:20.937]  But...
[02:13:22.782 --> 02:13:33.092]  The media spends this constantly, like, Jones is laughing at the billion-dollar judgment in Connecticut, or Jones is laughing at the lawyers requesting $2.57 trillion.
[02:13:33.092 --> 02:13:41.059]  Well, I mean, I'm laughing because I have a couple hundred thousand dollars in my savings account.
[02:13:44.625 --> 02:13:45.586]  We're good to go.
[02:14:05.783 --> 02:14:09.765]  I'd climb into the damn thing and say, pull the trigger, because I really care about people.
[02:14:09.765 --> 02:14:13.866]  See, these psychopaths, these sociopaths don't get that, that I'm committed to humanity.
[02:14:13.866 --> 02:14:15.087]  I came from humans.
[02:14:15.087 --> 02:14:16.267]  I want humans to keep going on.
[02:14:16.267 --> 02:14:20.809]  I realize I'm a blip on the radar screen, and I'm a collectivist.
[02:14:20.809 --> 02:14:25.471]  I'm an individualist to the max, but it's individual vigor that adds to the collective.
[02:14:26.445 --> 02:14:28.826]  The collectivists try to enslave everybody and call it collectivism.
[02:14:28.826 --> 02:14:37.550]  As long as you empower everybody, then you have competition, and out of that competition in the collective, we create the superhuman, and that's where we're going.
[02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:40.431]  But as soon as you cut that out, you create the nightmare.
[02:14:40.431 --> 02:14:46.414]  So the Nazis and everybody want to suppress and control everybody to create the Ubermensch, and they create the opposite, mass death and destruction.
[02:14:46.414 --> 02:14:47.034]  It's the same thing.
[02:14:47.034 --> 02:14:47.434]  No.
[02:14:47.434 --> 02:14:50.856]  Empowerment, competition, open, free societies.
[02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:53.837]  Not George Soros' free society, it's a counterfeit.
[02:14:53.837 --> 02:14:58.861]  Real libertarian renaissance ideas is what empowers people.
[02:14:58.861 --> 02:15:01.603]  The problem is that the general public can't handle that much power.
[02:15:01.603 --> 02:15:06.866]  So we're going to get to your phone calls, but when we come back, they asked for $2.75 trillion.
[02:15:09.468 --> 02:15:11.329]  The judge just ruled.
[02:15:11.329 --> 02:15:13.010]  And what do you think she did?
[02:15:13.010 --> 02:15:15.972]  And I mean, it's ridiculous, okay?
[02:15:15.972 --> 02:15:17.974]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:15:17.974 --> 02:15:20.315]  And they put the filings together and they go, he's laughing at it.
[02:15:20.315 --> 02:15:21.956]  Well, of course I'm laughing at it!
[02:15:21.956 --> 02:15:25.379]  It'd be like if you sent me a bill for a billion dollars in the mail.
[02:15:25.379 --> 02:15:27.820]  Oh man, we got you!
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:29.481]  It's all for psychological effect.
[02:15:29.481 --> 02:15:31.183]  It's all the Wizard of Oz.
[02:15:31.183 --> 02:15:33.524]  I am the great and powerful Oz!
[02:15:33.524 --> 02:15:35.706]  When they go full well with bankruptcy law and all the rest of it,
[02:15:36.912 --> 02:15:40.214]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[02:16:02.662 --> 02:16:15.807]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[02:16:15.807 --> 02:16:30.533]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[02:16:35.166 --> 02:16:38.606]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[02:16:38.606 --> 02:16:41.407]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[02:16:41.407 --> 02:16:45.688]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[02:16:56.610 --> 02:17:17.240]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:30.868]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[02:17:30.868 --> 02:17:39.714]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:17:39.714 --> 02:17:46.118]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:17:46.238 --> 02:17:47.659]  So continue to do it.

[02:17:57.883 --> 02:17:59.724]  It's our bestseller.
[02:17:59.724 --> 02:18:03.486]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[02:18:03.486 --> 02:18:12.570]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:14.671]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[02:18:15.151 --> 02:18:21.817]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[02:18:21.817 --> 02:18:28.943]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[02:18:28.943 --> 02:18:31.546]  Essential means without these things you die.
[02:18:31.546 --> 02:18:39.653]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[02:18:39.653 --> 02:18:41.875]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[02:18:42.335 --> 02:18:46.542]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWar.

[02:19:55.518 --> 02:19:57.119]  Visit InfoWareStore.com.
[02:19:57.119 --> 02:20:03.042]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:14.822]  Rallying patriots worldwide!
[02:20:14.822 --> 02:20:15.442]  Woo!
[02:20:15.442 --> 02:20:20.623]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:20.623 --> 02:20:21.924]  Episode 1776, A New Hope.
[02:20:21.924 --> 02:20:26.205]  Alright, so, this will be the big statement.
[02:20:26.205 --> 02:20:29.546]  The media will edit it and take it out of context, that's what they do.
[02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:40.977]  They already had a $965 million dollar rigged deal where the judge said I was guilty and told the jury that I was a bad person and wouldn't let me put on evidence and put on fake evidence against me.
[02:20:42.349 --> 02:20:46.051]  I don't have two million dollars, so it's a joke on them and they know that.
[02:20:46.051 --> 02:20:50.033]  They got all our discovery, they got all our financials and said we didn't give it to them and then did this.
[02:20:50.033 --> 02:20:55.276]  Now the judge has issued a ruling, my lawyer just said it to me ten minutes ago and it's already all over the news.
[02:20:55.276 --> 02:21:00.439]  Alex Jones ordered to pay $473 million more to Sandy Hook families.
[02:21:00.439 --> 02:21:01.379]  They've asked for two
[02:21:03.376 --> 02:21:11.580]  Point seven five trillion or two thousand seven hundred and fifty million, which is ridiculous.
[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:14.661]  And then now they want, oh, it's more reasonable.
[02:21:14.661 --> 02:21:19.784]  Only four hundred and seventy three million dollars.
[02:21:19.784 --> 02:21:23.706]  If I sold everything I had, it's not five million dollars, four million dollars.
[02:21:23.706 --> 02:21:27.007]  So that's the camera equipment in here and everything.
[02:21:27.007 --> 02:21:28.488]  So they're doing this.
[02:21:29.508 --> 02:21:34.793]  So you hear billion-dollar numbers, you hear 400 million-dollar numbers, you hear trillion-dollar numbers, you think, well, he's over.
[02:21:34.793 --> 02:21:36.794]  That's not how America works, folks.
[02:21:36.794 --> 02:21:38.176]  They can't stop me from being on air.
[02:21:38.176 --> 02:21:40.017]  They can't stop me from broadcasting.
[02:21:40.017 --> 02:21:43.260]  They can't stop any of it, even though they admit that's their goal.
[02:21:43.260 --> 02:21:45.182]  So, I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:21:45.182 --> 02:21:46.863]  I'm going to briefly explain this.
[02:21:46.863 --> 02:21:49.626]  We're in Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, Bankruptcy.
[02:21:50.606 --> 02:21:54.947]  Because the system's not set up yet to just shut businesses down.
[02:21:54.947 --> 02:22:03.990]  So Alex Jones won't get any money, but the company and the crew and the operation will continue on as long as it's profitable.
[02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:09.452]  And the reason we can do bankruptcy is we've been almost insolvent in the last year, and so it's a very real bankruptcy.
[02:22:10.472 --> 02:22:13.174]  That's why buying products at InfoWarsTore.com is great.
[02:22:13.174 --> 02:22:13.955]  And it keeps us on air.
[02:22:13.955 --> 02:22:33.008]  When we make it out of this bankruptcy in the next three or four months, then we continue on, and then it's agreed that in the next two years, if they win these appeals, which everybody says they're going to lose, total kangaroo court, that's why they're so mad, then in two years, if we lose the appeal, then whatever profit there is from InfoWars, and there is almost no profit, goes to them.
[02:22:33.008 --> 02:22:33.649]  And they know that.
[02:22:33.649 --> 02:22:35.730]  That's why they're like, no, we don't want that judge.
[02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:37.672]  They told the bankruptcy judge, we just want him taken off air.
[02:22:38.646 --> 02:22:41.233]  The judge is like, well wait, don't you want money as creditors?
[02:22:41.233 --> 02:22:42.657]  No, we don't want money!
[02:22:42.657 --> 02:22:43.339]  We want him off air!
[02:22:43.339 --> 02:22:45.685]  They set up their closing arguments in Texas and Connecticut.
[02:22:45.685 --> 02:22:46.186]  So, again...
[02:22:47.332 --> 02:22:48.852]  You're keeping us on air.
[02:22:48.852 --> 02:22:50.153]  You're letting us do the appeals.
[02:22:50.153 --> 02:23:04.357]  You are doing the exact opposite of what they want by going to InfoWarsTore.com right now and getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, X3 is about to sell out, Super Mel Vitality, Alpha Power, Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:23:04.357 --> 02:23:06.358]  These are all incredible products.
[02:23:06.358 --> 02:23:13.060]  There's not anywhere you can fight for the Republic stronger than InfoWarsTore.com and spread the articles and videos from the sites.
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:16.801]  So if you don't have the money to buy a book, a signed book, an unsigned book, or experience
[02:23:17.682 --> 02:23:18.002]  I don't know.
[02:23:31.161 --> 02:23:34.324]  They think they're running a PSYOP to make you give up.
[02:23:34.324 --> 02:23:44.171]  They think, when you hear about a billion dollars here, and $2.75 trillion there, and $473 million there, you just go, my gosh!
[02:23:44.171 --> 02:23:46.874]  The Wizard of Oz guy was 100 feet tall and green!
[02:23:46.874 --> 02:23:50.537]  I am the great and powerful Oz!
[02:23:50.537 --> 02:23:51.918]  He's a projection!
[02:23:51.918 --> 02:23:55.721]  So like, it didn't scare him at 100 feet tall, make it a thousand.
[02:23:55.721 --> 02:23:57.222]  Okay, a billion, does it?
[02:23:57.222 --> 02:23:58.743]  Make it two billion!
[02:23:58.743 --> 02:23:59.544]  Make it two trillion!
[02:24:01.411 --> 02:24:02.292]  And it's just a little man.
[02:24:02.292 --> 02:24:09.279]  It's just a little goblin behind the curtain, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:09.279 --> 02:24:11.601]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:24:11.601 --> 02:24:15.545]  Incredible products you already need that fund this operation.
[02:24:16.764 --> 02:24:19.506]  And it literally is just going to cost us the next year.
[02:24:19.506 --> 02:24:20.306]  Sounds like a lot.
[02:24:20.306 --> 02:24:21.427]  It's not in a fight like this.
[02:24:21.427 --> 02:24:23.308]  A million dollars with appeals.
[02:24:23.308 --> 02:24:25.549]  And they got one more show trial in Texas coming up.
[02:24:25.549 --> 02:24:27.531]  So just go to SaveInfoWorks.com.
[02:24:27.531 --> 02:24:28.351]  Make it $5, $10, $20, $100.
[02:24:28.351 --> 02:24:30.472]  I want to thank all those that did.
[02:24:30.472 --> 02:24:30.973]  Donation.
[02:24:30.973 --> 02:24:33.134]  That all goes directly to the Legal Defense Fund.
[02:24:33.134 --> 02:24:35.175]  We've raised almost $300,000 there.
[02:24:35.175 --> 02:24:35.555]  That's great.
[02:24:35.555 --> 02:24:36.616]  It's all been spent.
[02:24:36.616 --> 02:24:37.477]  We need more money.
[02:24:37.477 --> 02:24:38.657]  You want somebody to fight?
[02:24:38.657 --> 02:24:39.278]  We're doing it!
[02:24:40.649 --> 02:24:45.593]  I don't want to spend my time on products and money and funding, but I got to do it because I don't have George Soros.
[02:24:45.593 --> 02:24:50.877]  I've got you sitting there listening right now and the decision you're going to make.
[02:24:50.877 --> 02:24:52.259]  Infowarstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:24:52.259 --> 02:24:53.780]  Other great sites like 1776coin.com.
[02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:54.981]  The coin's almost sold out.
[02:24:54.981 --> 02:24:56.362]  You can get up to $30 off the promo code 1776.
[02:24:56.362 --> 02:24:57.143]  But here are the headlines.
[02:24:57.143 --> 02:24:58.724]  Alex Jones ordered to pay $473 million more.
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:17.305]  And some of the public's so dumb, at restaurants and grocery stores, people walk up to me and they go, so I didn't know you were a billionaire.
[02:25:17.305 --> 02:25:29.553]  They believe, a small minority of folks, that because the media says I'm worth hundreds of millions of dollars or whatever, and I have billions of dollars of fake judgments, that it's real!
[02:25:29.553 --> 02:25:31.654]  This is like cuckoo land!
[02:25:32.432 --> 02:25:34.975]  Total, complete, cuckoo land.
[02:25:34.975 --> 02:25:36.356]  Let me tell you where I'm rich.
[02:25:36.356 --> 02:25:37.498]  Friends and family.
[02:25:37.498 --> 02:25:39.199]  Let me tell you where I'm rich.
[02:25:39.199 --> 02:25:48.730]  Reaching billions of people, hundreds of millions a month, of people, minds, souls that matter, that need the truth, and unborn babies that have got to be protected.
[02:25:50.137 --> 02:25:53.540]  I am one of the richest men in the world when it comes to influence.
[02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:57.183]  If influence was the currency, I am a tycoon.
[02:25:57.183 --> 02:25:58.304]  I am a juggernaut.
[02:25:58.304 --> 02:26:02.608]  I am a force of nature, but only through God, not me.
[02:26:02.608 --> 02:26:13.397]  But through the genes and the spirit and the family and the environment, I was given, I sprouted, I gave good fruit, and I am nothing but humble and blessed to be here as your humble servant.
[02:26:13.397 --> 02:26:15.759]  And you've commissioned me into this fight.
[02:26:15.759 --> 02:26:17.621]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:26:18.766 --> 02:26:24.650]  They are so pissed after they had their fake Connecticut ruling with a fake, you know, I'm already guilty.
[02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:25.891]  Tell the jury I'm guilty.
[02:26:25.891 --> 02:26:26.932]  Totally rigged.
[02:26:26.932 --> 02:26:29.774]  They said, Alex Jones listeners, don't bet on him.
[02:26:29.774 --> 02:26:31.195]  He's going down.
[02:26:31.195 --> 02:26:32.436]  Do not buy his products.
[02:26:32.436 --> 02:26:33.837]  I thought you want my money.
[02:26:33.837 --> 02:26:35.598]  They know we don't have money.
[02:26:35.598 --> 02:26:36.739]  They have all the intel.
[02:26:36.739 --> 02:26:38.080]  Democratic Party runs this.
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:38.901]  Deep State runs this.
[02:26:40.273 --> 02:26:46.058]  And they are just enraged right now that they just cannot make you give up.
[02:26:46.058 --> 02:26:47.459]  They cannot make you submit.
[02:26:47.459 --> 02:26:50.301]  They cannot stand it.
[02:26:50.301 --> 02:26:52.663]  They want to hold me up as an example.
[02:26:52.663 --> 02:27:00.269]  Their persecution, their lies, their straw men, their demonization is a badge of courage other than my family.
[02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:16.942]  And we're all, you know, in this fight, my most valuable possession is that the enemies of freedom and the human species and God, big G, big O, big D, triple exclamation point to infinity, are my enemies.
[02:27:16.942 --> 02:27:23.488]  And there's nowhere, your word of mouth is more key than InfoWars.com and Man.VideoNewsWars.com.
[02:27:23.488 --> 02:27:24.729]  All right, I said I'd take calls.
[02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:27.510]  But I'm going to take your calls.
[02:27:27.510 --> 02:27:28.671]  But I'm going to give each caller about a minute.
[02:27:28.671 --> 02:27:29.932]  You're going to talk about the election.
[02:27:29.932 --> 02:27:30.852]  We're going to talk about the election.
[02:27:30.852 --> 02:27:32.293]  I want to hear what you say about the election.
[02:27:32.293 --> 02:27:34.254]  I'm going to move the next person.
[02:27:34.254 --> 02:27:35.855]  And then who have we got in the fourth hour?
[02:27:35.855 --> 02:27:38.016]  I'm going to have to take some of the fourth hour here.
[02:27:38.016 --> 02:27:41.218]  We've got, oh my gosh, Paul Watson's been off a few weeks.
[02:27:41.218 --> 02:27:42.459]  He's returned to Paul Watson.
[02:27:42.459 --> 02:27:43.119]  This should be interesting.
[02:27:43.119 --> 02:27:44.480]  So I don't want to cut into him.
[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:46.561]  And then the War Room is coming up 3 p.m.
[02:27:46.561 --> 02:27:48.442]  Central Standard Time.
[02:27:48.442 --> 02:27:49.983]  But we're going to come out of break.
[02:27:49.983 --> 02:27:50.884]  Hell, let's not just come out of break.
[02:27:50.884 --> 02:27:52.945]  Let's go to Beverly in California.
[02:27:52.945 --> 02:27:53.885]  It's one minute on air.
[02:27:53.885 --> 02:27:54.566]  Beverly, go ahead.
[02:27:55.939 --> 02:28:19.751]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say thank you for all that you do and also I'm kind of curious to know what you think about Gavin Newsom supposedly not even being qualified to be on the ballot even in the primaries because of SB 27 which he signed in 2019 which says all presidential and gubernatorial candidates
[02:28:20.251 --> 02:28:20.891]  Well, exactly.
[02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:23.073]  We know Democrats never follow their own rules.
[02:28:32.979 --> 02:28:36.361]  And apparently on the website, it's been scrubbed.
[02:28:36.361 --> 02:28:37.282]  You can't find it.
[02:28:37.282 --> 02:28:43.705]  The page doesn't exist, except if you go to the Wayback Machine, you can see that the tax returns are missing for 2021.
[02:28:43.705 --> 02:28:46.987]  Well, I tell you, Gavin Newsom's there, darling.
[02:28:46.987 --> 02:28:47.828]  He's running for president.
[02:28:47.828 --> 02:28:48.708]  He's enemy number one.
[02:28:48.708 --> 02:28:49.749]  Great point, Beverly.
[02:28:49.749 --> 02:28:50.549]  Thank you for calling.
[02:28:50.549 --> 02:28:51.390]  Back with more calls.
[02:28:51.390 --> 02:28:55.792]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.792 --> 02:29:01.756]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:29:03.058 --> 02:29:13.441]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[02:29:55.876 --> 02:29:59.367]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[02:29:59.367 --> 02:30:02.516]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[02:30:02.516 --> 02:30:03.278]  Now, I knew that.
[02:30:04.113 --> 02:30:08.355]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[02:30:08.355 --> 02:30:10.796]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[02:30:10.796 --> 02:30:15.658]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
[02:30:15.658 --> 02:30:22.861]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible, game-changing products while at the same time keeping us on air.

[02:30:31.844 --> 02:30:35.587]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:31:02.003 --> 02:31:05.114]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[02:31:06.203 --> 02:31:11.124]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:31:11.124 --> 02:31:14.645]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[02:31:14.645 --> 02:31:15.505]  It's game over.
[02:31:15.505 --> 02:31:21.206]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:31:21.206 --> 02:31:25.787]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:31:25.787 --> 02:31:31.949]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[02:31:32.429 --> 02:31:44.417]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[02:31:44.417 --> 02:31:50.521]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:50.521 --> 02:31:52.342]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[02:31:57.262 --> 02:32:02.164]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[02:32:02.164 --> 02:32:08.567]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[02:32:08.567 --> 02:32:13.689]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:32:13.689 --> 02:32:15.390]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:32:15.390 --> 02:32:21.833]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we have this success.
[02:32:22.553 --> 02:32:27.977]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[02:32:27.977 --> 02:32:32.140]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:32:32.140 --> 02:32:41.546]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:32:41.546 --> 02:32:42.887]  God bless you all.
[02:32:42.887 --> 02:32:43.928]  I salute you.
[02:32:43.928 --> 02:32:45.029]  I thank you.
[02:32:45.029 --> 02:32:50.753]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:32:51.053 --> 02:32:52.376]  The fight is my fight.
[02:32:52.376 --> 02:32:52.997]  It's your fight.
[02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:53.738]  It's our fight.
[02:32:53.738 --> 02:32:54.520]  God bless you all.
[02:33:11.314 --> 02:33:14.797]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:14.797 --> 02:33:22.723]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.043 --> 02:33:46.231]  So, 30 plus years ago when I decided I was going to fight the globalists, 28 years ago when I got on air, I knew the globalists were already in partial control of the planet.
[02:33:46.231 --> 02:33:47.832]  I knew they meant business.
[02:33:47.832 --> 02:33:48.953]  I knew they had to be challenged.
[02:33:48.953 --> 02:33:50.514]  And we could build a resistance against them.
[02:33:50.514 --> 02:33:53.597]  That's why we're enemy number one.
[02:33:53.597 --> 02:33:56.099]  And we've already done such incredible work together.
[02:33:56.099 --> 02:33:57.280]  It's all in God's hands now.
[02:33:57.280 --> 02:34:00.242]  But every day we stay on air, damages are more and more.
[02:34:00.242 --> 02:34:01.664]  Our credibility is the highest ever.
[02:34:01.664 --> 02:34:02.725]  That means your credibility is.
[02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:04.591]  I salute and thank you all.
[02:34:04.591 --> 02:34:07.132]  All right, let's rampage through calls.
[02:34:07.132 --> 02:34:10.514]  Craig in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:34:10.514 --> 02:34:11.855]  Yeah, hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:34:11.855 --> 02:34:12.936]  Good, brother.
[02:34:12.936 --> 02:34:25.843]  Hey, just a quick thought that could be, might not be the right time for us to be strong as humans, but could be a revolutionary thought or could be used in the wrong hands to get us.
[02:34:25.843 --> 02:34:28.785]  And it kind of stems, Naomi Wolf had an article like
[02:34:29.386 --> 02:34:32.688]  When are we going to consider not making voting anonymous?
[02:34:32.688 --> 02:34:35.730]  You know, if you put your name on it, there would go all fraud issues.
[02:34:35.730 --> 02:34:38.851]  But we'd have to be strong individuals with conviction.
[02:34:38.851 --> 02:34:39.572]  Well, exactly.
[02:34:39.572 --> 02:34:41.253]  I mean, they want your ID to buy a gun.
[02:34:41.253 --> 02:34:42.433]  They want your ID for insurance.
[02:34:42.433 --> 02:34:42.954]  But voting?
[02:34:42.954 --> 02:34:43.954]  Oh, the Democrats don't want that.
[02:34:43.954 --> 02:34:45.775]  Remember, they never wanted illegals to vote.
[02:34:45.775 --> 02:34:50.158]  Now, all over the country, in city elections, the Democrats have legalized illegal aliens voting.
[02:34:51.041 --> 02:34:52.162]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:52.162 --> 02:34:59.105]  So, but actually putting your name on your ballot, so not being anonymous, which would be, I don't know if we're ready for that.
[02:34:59.105 --> 02:35:00.086]  And I don't know if we're ready.
[02:35:00.086 --> 02:35:07.829]  The idea I have, let's just say Herschel Walker's election, what if everybody who was going to vote for him wore a red shirt that day?
[02:35:07.829 --> 02:35:09.510]  And just an idea.
[02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:14.993]  I mean, the deep state could come through this in their favor and be like, yeah, bring it on.
[02:35:14.993 --> 02:35:18.055]  We're going to use that and we're going to stuff it down your throat.
[02:35:18.055 --> 02:35:19.836]  But just, you know, something that would allow
[02:35:21.235 --> 02:35:26.578]  The eyes to see what we're not being told from the deep, so.
[02:35:26.578 --> 02:35:27.378]  Great point, sir.
[02:35:27.378 --> 02:35:29.519]  Thank you, Craig, for calling.
[02:35:29.519 --> 02:35:31.300]  Let's talk to another Craig in Ohio.
[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:33.161]  You're on the air.
[02:35:33.161 --> 02:35:35.482]  Yeah, Alex, great job on the 5G to open the show.
[02:35:35.482 --> 02:35:40.164]  That's the best explanation connection I've heard to the jab yet.
[02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:41.185]  I was on six months ago.
[02:35:41.185 --> 02:35:45.187]  I made a prediction the dollar would go higher, even when the countless idiots said it would go lower.
[02:35:45.187 --> 02:35:46.328]  Now I'm going to call the U.S.
[02:35:46.328 --> 02:35:47.788]  dollar to Swiss franc going up.
[02:35:47.788 --> 02:35:49.209]  It has huge energy building in it.
[02:35:49.727 --> 02:36:03.273]  The reason I say this is because I think it ties with the Bank of International Standards, which also ties with the great piece Kate Daly did yesterday about why Biden and Fetterman are trying to prep us for the central bank digital currency.
[02:36:03.273 --> 02:36:13.117]  Now that we're admitting the elections are rigged by electronics, I'd also like to try to get out there that markets have been rigged for a long time because of electronics.
[02:36:13.117 --> 02:36:17.579]  I've watched the evolution... Well, that's how Bloomberg made his $50 million.
[02:36:17.579 --> 02:36:18.500]  It's all... Exactly.
[02:36:19.608 --> 02:36:33.276]  Yeah, so the thing is, this deserves a lot of credit and I'd like to try to get with Greg Reese because I've got a ton of information that he could do his short clips on and this really needs to get out there because capital markets are just as important as protecting our southern border.
[02:36:33.276 --> 02:36:37.118]  Our whole show is about connecting great minds with our crew.
[02:36:37.118 --> 02:36:37.859]  Guys, get...
[02:36:38.539 --> 02:36:38.619]  I, uh...
[02:36:56.724 --> 02:37:10.635]  You know, I was calling because I think as far as the elections go, I think everyone's figured out that, you know, these rebranded Titanic bankers from Europe who are trying to take over the world and call us at the same time.
[02:37:14.977 --> 02:37:25.860]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:30.981]  Rand Paul won by a giant majority by promising to try to get Anthony Fauci arrested.
[02:37:30.981 --> 02:37:33.442]  In fact, I'm going to start the show with that video.
[02:37:33.442 --> 02:37:38.183]  Victorious Rand Paul vows to subpoena every last document of Dr. Fauci.
[02:37:38.183 --> 02:37:39.404]  Yes, we must go on the offensive.
[02:37:39.404 --> 02:37:40.324]  In fact, give me that clip, guys.
[02:37:41.244 --> 02:37:41.725]  Go ahead.
[02:37:41.725 --> 02:37:43.706]  Sorry, Travis.
[02:37:43.706 --> 02:37:50.553]  Yeah, and that was actually the point I wanted to furthermore because I think we all need to get behind Rand Paul a bit more.
[02:37:50.553 --> 02:37:52.175]  I mean, he's the one that's there.
[02:37:52.175 --> 02:37:52.835]  No, I'll say it.
[02:37:52.835 --> 02:37:56.959]  I think Rand Paul as a man, as a leader, is 100% genuine.
[02:37:56.959 --> 02:38:01.844]  I've known him since he was on my show in 96, promoting his dad, getting re-elected to Congress.
[02:38:01.844 --> 02:38:02.865]  I've known him for 25 years.
[02:38:04.366 --> 02:38:06.107]  I think we need Rand Paul as president.
[02:38:06.107 --> 02:38:10.951]  I think he's better than DeSantis and better than Trump on actual policies and his grasp of things.
[02:38:10.951 --> 02:38:16.434]  And I'm not trying to have a horse race here, but if we got a horse race between Trump and DeSantis, what about Rand Paul?
[02:38:16.434 --> 02:38:21.458]  He doesn't have all the Hollywood pizazz, but he's probably the best person we have in the federal government.
[02:38:23.421 --> 02:38:29.583]  Yes, I think we should stop asking questions that the Democrats ask, like, who's more marketable?
[02:38:29.583 --> 02:38:31.644]  Who's going to win?
[02:38:31.644 --> 02:38:32.364]  That type of thing.
[02:38:32.364 --> 02:38:36.065]  And we should say, who's been fighting for us?
[02:38:36.065 --> 02:38:37.346]  Who has his ribs broken?
[02:38:38.886 --> 02:38:45.189]  And if you look, if you look, it's MTG, it's Matt Gaetz, it's Rand Paul winning by the biggest numbers.
[02:38:45.189 --> 02:38:46.710]  Pete, I totally agree with you.
[02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:48.570]  I meant to say this today before I got on the air.
[02:38:48.570 --> 02:38:51.412]  I was going to say, that's why I love to take calls.
[02:38:51.412 --> 02:38:52.532]  I forget to make my points.
[02:38:52.532 --> 02:38:59.215]  And when I take your calls, you make the organic, true point that we want hard chargers, we want real people, we want authenticity.
[02:38:59.215 --> 02:39:00.316]  Thank you, Travis.
[02:39:00.316 --> 02:39:01.496]  Let's go to Sean in New York.
[02:39:01.496 --> 02:39:01.976]  You're on the air.
[02:39:01.976 --> 02:39:03.237]  Go ahead.
[02:39:03.237 --> 02:39:05.318]  Alex, I just want to thank you for your passion and your sacrifice.
[02:39:06.283 --> 02:39:18.571]  I was trying to vote here in New York, and I decided not to this time, because last time they mailed me something in the mail that said what party that I voted for, and I was very upset that that was on the front page of my mail that showed up to my house.
[02:39:18.571 --> 02:39:21.013]  So this year, I got a little upset with my girlfriend.
[02:39:21.013 --> 02:39:23.995]  She went out and voted, and I told her, listen, this year we're not going to vote.
[02:39:23.995 --> 02:39:28.478]  We're going to see if that paper comes again to see if we voted.
[02:39:28.478 --> 02:39:31.099]  And so you're going to find out and see if it came back?
[02:39:31.099 --> 02:39:34.381]  To see if it says that I voted when I didn't this time.
[02:39:34.381 --> 02:39:35.022]  That's a good point.
[02:39:35.848 --> 02:39:37.729]  Yeah, I mean, I don't know how they could do that.
[02:39:37.729 --> 02:39:40.710]  Just let every postman know, oh, this house is this, this house is that.
[02:39:40.710 --> 02:39:41.431]  How can that happen?
[02:39:41.431 --> 02:39:42.971]  How do I know that guy's not an agent?
[02:39:42.971 --> 02:39:45.272]  As far as I know, they were the last people to get vaccinated.
[02:39:45.272 --> 02:39:47.613]  They didn't force them because they needed them to win the election.
[02:39:47.613 --> 02:39:48.814]  You know that.
[02:39:48.814 --> 02:39:51.815]  Oh, the federal government doesn't have to take the shots.
[02:39:51.815 --> 02:39:53.516]  Only the troops.
[02:39:53.516 --> 02:39:56.277]  Yeah, I'm talking about the mailmen, the people in the post office.
[02:39:56.277 --> 02:39:59.138]  No, you're right.
[02:39:59.138 --> 02:40:02.140]  Don't you love how they exempt themselves from what they do to us?
[02:40:03.135 --> 02:40:04.416]  Alex, we love you, bro.
[02:40:04.416 --> 02:40:05.476]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:40:05.476 --> 02:40:07.878]  God bless you, my brother.
[02:40:07.878 --> 02:40:08.738]  God bless you, Sean.
[02:40:08.738 --> 02:40:09.719]  We're all in this together, brother.
[02:40:09.719 --> 02:40:11.420]  We're going to make it.
[02:40:11.420 --> 02:40:15.022]  Believe me, it looks bad now, but humanity's just now waking up.
[02:40:15.022 --> 02:40:16.483]  So things are going to get very, very positive.
[02:40:16.483 --> 02:40:18.284]  And I'm not just saying that.
[02:40:18.284 --> 02:40:21.165]  As negative as they are, it's Newtonian physics.
[02:40:21.165 --> 02:40:24.968]  For every action, there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[02:40:24.968 --> 02:40:26.168]  It's happening now.
[02:40:26.168 --> 02:40:26.909]  That's why they're scared.
[02:40:26.909 --> 02:40:28.590]  All right.
[02:40:28.590 --> 02:40:29.670]  Gordon in Alaska.
[02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:30.171]  You're on the air.
[02:40:30.171 --> 02:40:30.411]  Go ahead.
[02:40:32.145 --> 02:40:33.286]  Hey, Jones?
[02:40:33.286 --> 02:40:33.866]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:33.866 --> 02:40:35.087]  You hear me?
[02:40:35.087 --> 02:40:36.227]  Oh, wow.
[02:40:36.227 --> 02:40:36.868]  What a moment.
[02:40:36.868 --> 02:40:39.309]  I've been listening to you since October of 2001.
[02:40:39.309 --> 02:40:40.089]  Wow.
[02:40:40.089 --> 02:40:44.091]  Nice to finally reach out to you.
[02:40:44.091 --> 02:40:52.236]  But anyway, real fast, so up here in Alaska, we just used Ranked Choice Voting for the first time.
[02:40:52.236 --> 02:40:55.217]  And I'm not really sold on the idea.
[02:40:55.217 --> 02:40:57.038]  I'm still kind of weighing it.
[02:40:57.038 --> 02:40:59.820]  But it's something that's not really
[02:41:01.032 --> 02:41:01.492]  How does it work?
[02:41:01.492 --> 02:41:02.672]  Explain it to me.
[02:41:24.575 --> 02:41:32.079]  And what's interesting is that's actually encouraged a two-party system, according to a bunch of them fancy sociologists out there.
[02:41:32.079 --> 02:41:33.500]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:36.922]  So... So you're talking about a parliamentary system?
[02:41:36.922 --> 02:41:37.762]  Yes!
[02:41:37.762 --> 02:41:38.903]  Then, bingo, man!
[02:41:38.903 --> 02:41:45.426]  So that's why I love friggin' interacting with you, because you know right away, it is European in nature.
[02:41:45.426 --> 02:41:46.287]  That's where it comes from.
[02:41:46.287 --> 02:41:50.229]  But the idea is that it opens up third parties, from what I understand.
[02:41:51.147 --> 02:41:53.790]  But, um, I don't even know if that's really a solution.
[02:41:53.790 --> 02:41:59.757]  It's almost like... It's like if your, um, if your car, like, headlights are out, right?
[02:42:00.775 --> 02:42:03.657]  Our voting system is clearly in need of maintenance.
[02:42:03.657 --> 02:42:12.202]  Well, I was about to say, as bad as the two-party system is, in a parliamentary, it's easy whoever's in power to make alliances with the other sub-parties.
[02:42:12.202 --> 02:42:17.044]  And then, so let's say the party in power gets 30% like Trudeau.
[02:42:17.044 --> 02:42:19.266]  He just goes out and gets a few other groups to go to 51.
[02:42:19.266 --> 02:42:21.427]  Now he nixes all the other groups.
[02:42:21.427 --> 02:42:24.268]  So, they've both got their problems, but I hear what you're saying.
[02:42:24.268 --> 02:42:26.289]  Alright, we're going to break.
[02:42:26.289 --> 02:42:26.830]  When we come back.
[02:42:28.100 --> 02:42:37.666]  Norm Pattis, my lawyer, is going to respond to the $473 million on top of the $965 million.
[02:42:37.666 --> 02:42:39.107]  It's all academic.
[02:42:39.107 --> 02:42:41.469]  It's all Monopoly money.
[02:42:41.469 --> 02:42:44.411]  It's all the great and powerful laws trying to scare you.
[02:42:44.411 --> 02:42:45.912]  Oh, don't support him.
[02:42:45.912 --> 02:42:47.373]  That's a billion dollars.
[02:42:47.373 --> 02:42:49.575]  They think you're stupid, but you're not.
[02:42:49.575 --> 02:42:50.495]  We're winning.
[02:42:50.495 --> 02:42:51.516]  They're losing.
[02:42:51.516 --> 02:42:52.296]  InfoWars.com.
[02:42:59.673 --> 02:43:04.015]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:43:04.015 --> 02:43:15.622]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:43:15.622 --> 02:43:21.985]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists
[02:43:22.205 --> 02:43:23.086]  We're good to go!
[02:43:55.828 --> 02:44:16.438]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[02:44:16.958 --> 02:44:30.089]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[02:44:30.089 --> 02:44:38.937]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:44:38.937 --> 02:44:45.162]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:44:45.522 --> 02:44:47.903]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[02:44:47.903 --> 02:44:50.344]  But when you fight tyranny, the New World Order comes after you.
[02:44:50.344 --> 02:44:51.084]  Now, I knew that.
[02:45:05.011 --> 02:45:09.214]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[02:45:09.214 --> 02:45:11.716]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[02:45:11.716 --> 02:45:16.520]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:23.526]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible, game-changing products, all at the same time, keeping us on air.
[02:45:23.886 --> 02:45:24.386]  We're good to go.
[02:45:40.376 --> 02:45:45.821]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[02:46:03.553 --> 02:46:17.335]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[02:47:01.624 --> 02:47:02.925]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:47:28.442 --> 02:47:33.265]  A bunch of top globalist deep-shake kingpins like John Brennan have just been confronted.
[02:47:33.265 --> 02:47:34.426]  We're getting the videos right now.
[02:47:34.426 --> 02:47:38.509]  It's coming up here in a few minutes as humanity awakens.
[02:47:38.509 --> 02:47:41.131]  Once we're awake, nothing to do is going to work in the long run.
[02:47:41.131 --> 02:47:41.731]  That's the key.
[02:47:41.731 --> 02:47:42.532]  Awaken the people.
[02:47:42.532 --> 02:47:43.553]  Awaken the sleeping giant.
[02:47:43.553 --> 02:47:45.474]  Let's take your phone calls right now.
[02:47:45.474 --> 02:47:47.055]  Casey in New York, you're on the air.
[02:47:47.055 --> 02:47:50.077]  Hello.
[02:47:50.077 --> 02:47:56.982]  I just saw God Bless You Man and I wanted to tell you I was wearing an InfoWars shirt and someone bought my dinner and it was like four times the cost of the shirt.
[02:47:58.166 --> 02:48:00.788]  Have I not told you that'll happen?
[02:48:00.788 --> 02:48:01.989]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:48:01.989 --> 02:48:05.911]  So anyways, I wanted to address something that Owen was talking about.
[02:48:05.911 --> 02:48:10.674]  He was saying how there's Democratic candidates who get like 90% of the vote.
[02:48:10.674 --> 02:48:18.159]  Well, here in New York State, the Republican arm of the Uniparty is so feckless, they don't even bother to put Republican candidates up.
[02:48:18.777 --> 02:48:19.037]  Right?
[02:48:19.037 --> 02:48:24.260]  So the Democrats are running unopposed and these are like, you know, real leftists running unopposed.
[02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:33.466]  So then when they put your ballot through the machine, just automatically, you know, because there's no option to say, no, I don't vote for this person, like no vote, right?
[02:48:33.466 --> 02:48:37.168]  So the machine automatically gives the vote to the unopposed candidate.
[02:48:37.168 --> 02:48:43.192]  So you have somebody running, you know, getting like 95% of the vote.
[02:48:43.192 --> 02:48:44.233]  That's a really good point.
[02:48:44.233 --> 02:48:46.814]  Where do you think this is all going?
[02:48:46.814 --> 02:48:47.795]  Where do I think it's going?
[02:48:50.539 --> 02:48:54.024]  Well, like Mike Lindell said, you know, we got to keep the faith.
[02:48:54.024 --> 02:48:55.887]  This is only just the beginning.
[02:48:55.887 --> 02:48:57.128]  We cannot let up.
[02:48:57.128 --> 02:48:59.692]  We have to put the foot on the gas, you know.
[02:48:59.692 --> 02:49:06.140]  I'm personally, I'm going to get in touch with New York Citizens Audit and I'm going to see what I can do here on the local level.
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.902]  Well, I'll tell you what's beautiful, as they always say, it's not the destination, it's the journey.
[02:49:11.902 --> 02:49:22.907]  Getting to meet all the great people, race, color, and creed, male, female, gay, straight, you name it, it doesn't matter, that want freedom in this process is what's amazing.
[02:49:22.907 --> 02:49:29.830]  Getting to talk to you, Casey, and all the great things you're saying, it's the process that is really the best.
[02:49:29.830 --> 02:49:31.631]  Thank you so much for calling in.
[02:49:31.631 --> 02:49:33.552]  All right, let's talk to Evan and Debra.
[02:49:34.409 --> 02:49:43.855]  Evan in Kentucky where Rand Paul just won by huge margins promising to go out to the deep state for their COVID attack and the COVID cover up as he calls it.
[02:49:43.855 --> 02:49:44.736]  What's on your mind today?
[02:49:44.736 --> 02:49:48.438]  Yes sir, how are you Alex?
[02:49:48.438 --> 02:49:50.879]  You know I'm in the fight brother so I'm actually doing pretty good.
[02:49:50.879 --> 02:49:53.461]  Myself, I like what I'm doing.
[02:49:53.461 --> 02:49:56.563]  My spirit, I really feel good every day.
[02:49:56.563 --> 02:49:58.504]  Sleep really good, feel really strong.
[02:49:58.504 --> 02:50:00.766]  I'm under a lot of attack but I feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be.
[02:50:02.574 --> 02:50:05.537]  Yes sir, I just wanted to say we love you here in Kentucky.
[02:50:05.537 --> 02:50:07.298]  Love you.
[02:50:07.298 --> 02:50:18.028]  And yeah, I was wondering, so with it being like three days out from the election, there's no representation from the Republican side to, you know, watch them create votes?
[02:50:19.210 --> 02:50:23.314]  No, I mean, look, it's big tech, it's big media, it's the corporations.
[02:50:23.314 --> 02:50:30.820]  They're foreign owned, they're out to get us, they're stealing in front of us, but we're making them steal in front of us and it's only going to make folks madder.
[02:50:30.820 --> 02:50:36.645]  And once we get 70% of the vote, which we're getting close to, they mathematically cannot steal it.
[02:50:36.645 --> 02:50:40.228]  They're so close right now where they're out of bullets.
[02:50:40.228 --> 02:50:41.529]  I mean, we are winning.
[02:50:44.352 --> 02:50:47.373]  Yes, but it just seems like everyone knows.
[02:50:47.373 --> 02:51:00.338]  I mean, I don't believe there's a soul here that believes that this is... But that's why Rand Paul, I've got the numbers here, but he got the highest Senate re-election number because Kentucky's awake, and it doesn't matter.
[02:51:00.338 --> 02:51:05.240]  I mean, literally, when you've got 70% of people voting for somebody, they can't steal it.
[02:51:07.319 --> 02:51:16.446]  You Kentucky overpowered, Florida overpowered, but I gotta say Kentucky better than Florida.
[02:51:16.446 --> 02:51:24.532]  Kentucky, Florida, Texas overpowered them with just sheer numbers.
[02:51:24.532 --> 02:51:29.135]  Yeah, but especially in the battleground states, like those are the only states really contested.
[02:51:31.570 --> 02:51:35.411]  Well, Kentucky was a battleground until folks got really pissed and woke.
[02:51:35.411 --> 02:51:37.892]  And so, yeah, it's here.
[02:51:37.892 --> 02:51:40.312]  In fact, guys, pull up the numbers I don't have in front of me.
[02:51:40.312 --> 02:51:41.413]  The article doesn't have it.
[02:51:41.413 --> 02:51:43.873]  But, like, Rand Paul won by a gigantic majority.
[02:51:43.873 --> 02:51:45.694]  They said one of the biggest wins out there.
[02:51:45.694 --> 02:51:47.154]  Well, yeah.
[02:51:47.154 --> 02:51:49.015]  He's a good person.
[02:51:49.015 --> 02:51:50.695]  And people know that.
[02:51:50.695 --> 02:51:53.956]  And he is the prototype, not DeSantis, not Trump.
[02:51:53.956 --> 02:51:55.657]  And I like both Trump and DeSantis.
[02:51:55.657 --> 02:51:59.858]  I'm saying Rand Paul on policies is the best thing we've got.
[02:51:59.858 --> 02:52:00.258]  Thank you, sir.
[02:52:01.209 --> 02:52:03.050]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:52:03.050 --> 02:52:05.132]  Deborah in Boston, Massachusetts.
[02:52:05.132 --> 02:52:07.113]  You're on the air.
[02:52:07.113 --> 02:52:11.537]  Oh my God, Alex, I can't even believe I'm talking to you.
[02:52:11.537 --> 02:52:12.818]  I'm a female.
[02:52:12.818 --> 02:52:14.499]  I'm a female in Massachusetts.
[02:52:14.499 --> 02:52:21.364]  So I was watching you like 20 years ago.
[02:52:21.364 --> 02:52:27.148]  Honestly, I kind of tune in and out so that I can try to not go crazy.
[02:52:27.148 --> 02:52:27.709]  That makes sense.
[02:52:29.631 --> 02:52:30.912]  Anyway, I had an idea.
[02:52:30.912 --> 02:52:35.134]  I have supported InfoWars.
[02:52:35.134 --> 02:52:37.675]  I've bought stuff.
[02:52:37.675 --> 02:52:47.560]  When I saw what they did with the truckers in Canada freezing their bank accounts and stuff, I have to admit that kind of scared me.
[02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:52.742]  And, you know, rallying is only so powerful.
[02:52:52.742 --> 02:52:55.624]  They're going to infiltrate and make somebody do something crazy.
[02:52:56.562 --> 02:53:00.366]  Any idea, honestly, it's like getting on your knees and asking.
[02:53:00.366 --> 02:53:01.567]  Anyway.
[02:53:01.567 --> 02:53:03.688]  Well, you're right, but here's an example.
[02:53:03.688 --> 02:53:14.218]  Rand Paul is the model of populist, forget Republican, forget conservative, forget man, woman, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, gay, straight, all this BS.
[02:53:14.218 --> 02:53:19.503]  Anti-war, pro-America, constitutionalist, common sense, he won by
[02:53:20.794 --> 02:53:22.876]  Put the numbers back on screen, please.
[02:53:22.876 --> 02:53:30.504]  He won by a gigantor, 61.7%, despite all the fraud.
[02:53:30.504 --> 02:53:33.106]  So, you cannot beat a tsunami of 70%, as I said.
[02:53:33.106 --> 02:53:34.548]  The guy he ran against got 38%, okay?
[02:53:34.548 --> 02:53:35.849]  So, this says 38, that says 38 too.
[02:53:45.529 --> 02:53:47.732]  I'm saying, don't we all agree with Rand Paul?
[02:53:47.732 --> 02:53:48.773]  Well, of course we do.
[02:53:48.773 --> 02:53:49.734]  That's the model.
[02:53:49.734 --> 02:53:51.476]  Not a Republican, not a Democrat.
[02:53:51.476 --> 02:53:57.062]  A populist that's pro-human, pro-success, and pro-America.
[02:53:57.062 --> 02:53:58.084]  Anything else, Deborah?
[02:53:59.406 --> 02:54:00.767]  Yeah, I totally agree.
[02:54:00.767 --> 02:54:01.868]  Hold on, I gotta go back to you.
[02:54:01.868 --> 02:54:02.548]  I gotta go back to you.
[02:54:02.548 --> 02:54:03.469]  We finally got my lawyer on.
[02:54:03.469 --> 02:54:06.771]  I'm gonna come back to you and back to Jonathan when we start the next hour.
[02:54:06.771 --> 02:54:08.493]  Norm Pettis, I know you're busy in a meeting.
[02:54:08.493 --> 02:54:10.194]  You came on with us.
[02:54:10.194 --> 02:54:13.676]  We've got confrontations with Brendan and others here in a minute.
[02:54:13.676 --> 02:54:16.338]  But another $473 million.
[02:54:16.338 --> 02:54:21.122]  The judge on top of $965 million.
[02:54:21.122 --> 02:54:25.465]  What do you make of this, Norm Pettis, the guy that was there at my show trial in Connecticut?
[02:54:26.772 --> 02:54:31.174]  Well, you know, obviously we know what we're looking at now and the hole got a little bit deeper.
[02:54:31.174 --> 02:54:33.515]  Candidly, I thought she'd go a lot deeper.
[02:54:33.515 --> 02:54:37.437]  I suspect she did what she could while maintaining a straight face.
[02:54:37.437 --> 02:54:42.860]  I think there's plenty of talk around the state that this unprecedented verdict remains vulnerable.
[02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:48.582]  And, you know, I think she tried to hit you hard, but not so hard as to be more shocking than this result already is.
[02:54:50.405 --> 02:54:51.066]  Absolutely.
[02:54:51.066 --> 02:54:52.769]  So what happens now?
[02:54:52.769 --> 02:54:54.231]  You've seen my finances.
[02:54:54.231 --> 02:54:54.972]  I don't have $2 million.
[02:54:54.972 --> 02:54:58.858]  Some people say, oh, the media says, he says he won't pay it.
[02:54:58.858 --> 02:55:03.825]  Well, I mean, if I weigh 260 pounds and they ask for a trillion pounds, I don't have that much flesh.
[02:55:05.188 --> 02:55:08.971]  No, I don't think these cases are about financial recovery.
[02:55:08.971 --> 02:55:15.135]  And at this point, I think these cases are about making the point, making an example of you and trying to shut you up, frankly.
[02:55:15.135 --> 02:55:26.722]  I think the goal is to pile you up with a judgment debt, the likes of which no one else has ever seen, no private person or non-corporation, and then see what you can do to score a lot of it.
[02:55:26.722 --> 02:55:31.325]  I think they'd like to put you on a financial leash with an aim of silencing you.
[02:55:31.325 --> 02:55:35.008]  And the asset test will be what becomes of the free speech bankruptcy.
[02:55:35.348 --> 02:55:40.270]  You know, the bankruptcy court has complete jurisdiction and access to your records and whatnot.
[02:55:40.270 --> 02:55:41.590]  They know what you have.
[02:55:41.590 --> 02:55:44.411]  People will be summoned to an effort to settle these cases.
[02:55:44.411 --> 02:55:49.532]  And if they don't try to settle in good faith, it'll be because their goal is to destroy you.
[02:55:49.532 --> 02:55:52.073]  And I don't think you'll let that happen.
[02:55:52.073 --> 02:55:54.714]  And they've said their goal is to silence us.
[02:55:56.363 --> 02:56:02.086]  Well, I hope for the sake of the American people and for the sake of yourself, you don't let that happen.
[02:56:02.086 --> 02:56:07.789]  I think you have a unique voice and it's a voice that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people listen to.
[02:56:07.789 --> 02:56:09.570]  Don't always understand everything you say.
[02:56:09.570 --> 02:56:12.371]  Don't always understand your appeal.
[02:56:12.371 --> 02:56:15.993]  But I know my world would be less rich without you in it.
[02:56:15.993 --> 02:56:18.795]  And I'm proud to represent you in the fight to remain on the air.
[02:56:19.704 --> 02:56:34.671]  Well the preposterous nature of a nine and a half billion dollar kangaroo court already found guilty by the judge verdict, I mean, I guess they put out the 2.75 trillion to make the billion and change look small.
[02:56:34.671 --> 02:56:36.672]  Is that what's happening with the anchoring?
[02:56:36.672 --> 02:56:41.514]  Like they've got like a, oh we want 2.75 trillion, but oh we want, I mean, is that what's happening?
[02:56:42.776 --> 02:56:44.517]  I don't know that they know what's happening.
[02:56:44.517 --> 02:56:46.859]  I mean, remember how the trial unfolded.
[02:56:46.859 --> 02:56:49.640]  You were sued, you were defaulted.
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:53.763]  At no point prior to the trial did anybody ever make a financial demand of you.
[02:56:53.763 --> 02:56:56.385]  During the trial itself, the plaintiffs had no financial demand.
[02:56:56.385 --> 02:56:57.986]  They presented no financial records.
[02:56:58.366 --> 02:57:03.948]  It wasn't until closing argument that their lawyers stood up and basically said, hey, 550 million.
[02:57:03.948 --> 02:57:08.049]  They've got 550 million impressions on social media in a given period.
[02:57:08.049 --> 02:57:12.911]  Give me give these people a dollar for each and maybe 550 million per plaintiff.
[02:57:12.911 --> 02:57:20.494]  You know, they threw a big number in front of the jury and then invited the jury to to to multiply by its own reasoning, by its own lights.
[02:57:20.994 --> 02:57:25.097]  It's like going to an apple tree that has ten apples and asking for a thousand.
[02:57:25.097 --> 02:57:26.899]  Norm Pettis, we'll talk to you tomorrow.
[02:57:26.899 --> 02:57:28.260]  Then you've got to get back to an important meeting.
[02:57:28.260 --> 02:57:29.801]  Thank you so much.
[02:57:29.801 --> 02:57:30.401]  Be well, Alex.
[02:57:30.401 --> 02:57:31.162]  Bye.
[02:57:31.162 --> 02:57:31.662]  All right.
[02:57:31.662 --> 02:57:32.663]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:32.663 --> 02:57:34.644]  Stay in attack formation.
[02:57:34.644 --> 02:57:36.586]  Debra, we'll finish up with you and then Jonathan.
[02:57:36.586 --> 02:57:41.810]  And then Paul Joseph Watson from His Majesty's Britannia.
[02:57:45.782 --> 02:57:51.772]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:57:53.078 --> 02:58:03.446]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.

[02:58:16.877 --> 02:58:28.381]  Treatment packages specifically for COVID, post-COVID, vaccine injury syndromes, and all the usual things that are seen in primary care.
[02:58:28.381 --> 02:58:36.563]  And then we have an entire array of holistic products, an online store, media, and health advice.

[02:58:48.607 --> 02:58:51.470]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[02:58:51.470 --> 02:58:53.512]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[02:58:53.512 --> 02:58:55.495]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[02:58:55.495 --> 02:58:57.577]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[02:58:57.577 --> 02:58:59.299]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[02:58:59.299 --> 02:59:01.701]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[02:59:01.701 --> 02:59:03.123]  You forget to take the X3.
[02:59:03.123 --> 02:59:04.625]  And you know it makes your life better.
[02:59:04.625 --> 02:59:06.086]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[02:59:06.086 --> 02:59:07.247]  And you constantly forget.
[02:59:07.247 --> 02:59:09.210]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[02:59:09.850 --> 02:59:12.832]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.
[02:59:12.832 --> 02:59:20.157]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now at InfoWarsTore.com with promo code 1776.

[02:59:32.285 --> 02:59:32.946]  We're good to go.
[03:00:02.285 --> 03:00:03.786]  Final segment I'm hosting.
[03:00:03.786 --> 03:00:06.467]  Paul Watson takes over and then Owen Schroeder in one hour.
[03:00:06.467 --> 03:00:07.688]  The War Room.
[03:00:07.688 --> 03:00:10.429]  And boy, is he ready to unload.
[03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:12.090]  Debra, finishing up your point from Boston.
[03:00:12.090 --> 03:00:14.711]  Go ahead.
[03:00:14.711 --> 03:00:15.591]  Hi.
[03:00:15.591 --> 03:00:18.173]  So, I have an idea.
[03:00:18.173 --> 03:00:21.534]  I want to support you and I want to try to encourage everybody else to support you.
[03:00:21.534 --> 03:00:29.778]  And I'm sure you have spectacular numbers as far as how many people are actually tuning in, listening and watching every day.
[03:00:29.778 --> 03:00:31.759]  If every single person
[03:00:32.777 --> 03:00:33.137]  I love it.
[03:00:51.391 --> 03:01:01.743]  If people get excited stopping him, people have to understand, in full force, this is a tip of the spear, but I'm going to take your idea, we're going to call it the Spartacus Fundraiser, because all we need is word of mouth and money, we'll beat the globalists.
[03:01:01.743 --> 03:01:08.170]  That's why we're trying to cut everybody's money off, not just ours, but the de-industrialization, the shipping of jobs to China.
[03:01:08.170 --> 03:01:09.111]  Amazing points, Deborah.
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:13.482]  We actually got Vivian Kubrick right here.
[03:01:13.482 --> 03:01:17.045]  Her dad made Spartacus and I'm Spartacus, made it really famous.
[03:01:17.045 --> 03:01:18.607]  She's down there videotaping.
[03:01:18.607 --> 03:01:19.928]  She's making a documentary.
[03:01:19.928 --> 03:01:22.930]  And so he popularized what happened with Spartacus, but that's absolutely true.
[03:01:22.930 --> 03:01:24.011]  Funny you mentioned that, Debra.
[03:01:24.011 --> 03:01:24.712]  Thank you.
[03:01:24.712 --> 03:01:26.994]  Jonathan in South Carolina.
[03:01:26.994 --> 03:01:29.196]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:01:29.196 --> 03:01:36.663]  General Jones, as I say thank you, I thank myself and all the other info warriors who are here rowing and paddling and
[03:01:37.005 --> 03:01:42.807]  We're actually bailing ourselves in this rowboat out of this storm that's coming.
[03:01:42.807 --> 03:02:06.657]  You know, and as far as elections go, man, this is so great that I can talk to you about this, because I want to jump ahead for just a moment and ask a rhetorical question that I'm going to answer, but do any of us think that this superhuman that we are to become in God's kingdom and go forward and leave all this evil behind, are we ever to answer to any actual authority that we're going to vote on?
[03:02:07.611 --> 03:02:09.514]  So, the answer is no.
[03:02:09.514 --> 03:02:17.986]  Now, to rewind back to what the Founding Fathers gave us, the idea was self-governance.
[03:02:19.102 --> 03:02:24.066]  Meaning, and of course we had to have people that we elected and put there to make sure it all followed through.
[03:02:24.066 --> 03:02:26.048]  But we are going, we're going full circle.
[03:02:26.048 --> 03:02:29.411]  We had to be informed, we had to know the topics, they were all representative.
[03:02:29.411 --> 03:02:36.357]  In fact, until 1913, same year we got the Federal Reserve, the IRS, they had that amendment, what is it, the 17th Amendment?
[03:02:36.357 --> 03:02:39.719]  I forget, look at the 17th Amendment, that made the Senators
[03:02:40.834 --> 03:02:50.727]  Elected instead of the legislators who we elect would then elect the senator to make the senator a creature of the state to balance the power.
[03:02:50.727 --> 03:02:58.998]  The House of Representatives was generally elected but then the senator was elected by the legislature and sent by the governor and we need to go back to that.
[03:02:59.864 --> 03:03:07.189]  We need to go to real self-governance, where we actually come around and realize, hey, we know how to build our own roads.
[03:03:07.189 --> 03:03:13.153]  We don't need to steal from people, steal their money, and then make a pile of it, and then go... No, I agree.
[03:03:13.153 --> 03:03:14.513]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:14.513 --> 03:03:16.034]  Paul Watts is taking over.
[03:03:16.034 --> 03:03:18.596]  But I want to finish up with this short clip.
[03:03:18.596 --> 03:03:25.801]  This is former CIA Director John Brennan that ran the attacks on America, and Trump that admits to chemtrails and all the evil involved in every form you can imagine.
[03:03:25.801 --> 03:03:27.402]  Here he is being confronted
[03:03:29.045 --> 03:03:34.387]  On a big list of crimes, so was John Bolton, and his answer is, you don't have your facts straight.
[03:03:34.387 --> 03:03:36.268]  No, we have our facts straight.
[03:03:36.268 --> 03:03:38.609]  We know you are a war criminal.
[03:03:38.609 --> 03:03:40.409]  Here is this short clip.
[03:03:40.409 --> 03:03:43.511]  We'll come back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:03:43.511 --> 03:03:44.111]  Please stay with us.
[03:03:45.419 --> 03:03:50.861]  How do you respond to the claims that your decision of the Bush and Obama administrations led to unnecessary torture?
[03:03:50.861 --> 03:04:07.146]  You addressed in there, you know, what you said was necessary, and you said you'll strive not to have any civilian deaths, but the documents leaked by Snowden show a whole other story, show the disposition matrix was not as accurate as you represented it, sir.
[03:04:07.146 --> 03:04:13.928]  How would you respond to the critics of you lying about surveillance, saying that there was no mass surveillance of Native Americans?
[03:04:13.928 --> 03:04:14.688]  That's on the record.
[03:04:15.628 --> 03:04:22.711]  And you, you know, originally people didn't want you in the Obama administration because your ties to torture under the Bush administration.
[03:04:22.711 --> 03:04:27.672]  Now you've rehabilitated your character and become a hero to the left because of your anti-Trumpness.
[03:04:27.672 --> 03:04:36.535]  But what do you say to the critics who still care about America not being a police of the world and not doing rendition and torture and kidnapping of Americans?
[03:04:36.535 --> 03:04:38.176]  What about the people who've had to sue the U.S.
[03:04:38.176 --> 03:04:40.437]  government because they've been tortured?
[03:04:40.437 --> 03:04:43.818]  The people who have permanent rectal damage because of the torture that you approved?
[03:04:44.298 --> 03:04:48.666]  The people who have permanent shoulder damage because they've been tortured by the US government under your decisions.
[03:04:48.666 --> 03:04:50.629]  I would say get your facts right.
[03:04:50.629 --> 03:04:52.372]  All your facts you've said right now are wrong.
[03:04:52.372 --> 03:04:52.813]  No, they're not.
[03:04:52.813 --> 03:04:53.734]  The lawsuits are there.
[03:04:55.996 --> 03:05:07.269]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:05:07.269 --> 03:05:09.171]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:05:09.171 --> 03:05:10.633]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:05:10.633 --> 03:05:12.135]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:05:12.135 --> 03:05:13.857]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:05:13.857 --> 03:05:15.138]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:05:15.138 --> 03:05:16.540]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:05:16.940 --> 03:05:21.784]  I studied the Globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:05:21.784 --> 03:05:24.167]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:05:24.167 --> 03:05:26.188]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:05:26.188 --> 03:05:33.155]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the Globalist agenda.
[03:05:33.775 --> 03:05:39.179]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:05:39.179 --> 03:05:48.105]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[03:05:48.105 --> 03:05:50.466]  1776 is the promo code.
[03:05:50.466 --> 03:05:54.389]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[03:06:16.677 --> 03:06:28.306]  Transmuting worldwide, from the Summit.nu studios in United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:28.306 --> 03:06:39.594]  We're live, it is the Summit News Hour, and it was election day, now it's election week, and it's going to be election fortnight, maybe it's going to be election month.
[03:06:39.594 --> 03:06:41.535]  When does it end?
[03:06:41.535 --> 03:06:43.396]  When does the counting end?
[03:06:43.396 --> 03:06:45.298]  When do we get the actual results?
[03:06:46.058 --> 03:06:56.542]  You know, Joe Stalin, when 99% of Soviets voted for him, he at least told them that 100% of the votes were in, and 99% of the votes were for Stalin.
[03:06:56.542 --> 03:07:00.283]  Americans apparently now, they don't get that privilege.
[03:07:00.283 --> 03:07:04.925]  We have a situation in Arizona, which I'm going to get into in a minute.
[03:07:04.925 --> 03:07:07.586]  But again, the wider picture.
[03:07:07.586 --> 03:07:14.328]  A historically unpopular president, record low approval ratings, rapidly declining cognitive abilities,
[03:07:14.955 --> 03:07:25.545]  Presiding over an inflation crisis, an economic crisis heading south in a hurry, and we're supposed to believe he had a better midterm than either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton.
[03:07:25.545 --> 03:07:28.028]  Makes absolute perfect sense to me.
[03:07:28.028 --> 03:07:38.318]  You have a situation where we can have elections in the United Kingdom where 40, 50 million people vote, and they've countered the vast majority of the votes in a matter of three or four hours.
[03:07:39.275 --> 03:07:43.876]  In Arizona, they're now saying it's going to take until next week.
[03:07:43.876 --> 03:07:48.917]  In Nevada, they're now saying it's going to take until next week.
[03:07:48.917 --> 03:07:54.738]  Why does Florida have the capability to count 7 million votes in a matter of hours?
[03:07:54.738 --> 03:08:02.260]  Why does Texas have the capability to count so many millions of votes in the same time period with vastly greater populations?
[03:08:03.055 --> 03:08:03.255]  We're good.
[03:08:22.620 --> 03:08:24.663]  Carrie Lake obviously won.
[03:08:24.663 --> 03:08:26.405]  She won after a few hours.
[03:08:26.405 --> 03:08:32.412]  All the remaining votes left to count are heavily in her favour for the Governor of Arizona.
[03:08:32.412 --> 03:08:35.856]  And yet they're doing these strategic voting dumps.
[03:08:35.856 --> 03:08:41.023]  Still trying to pretend that she's not got a path, got a course to victory.
[03:08:41.023 --> 03:08:42.084]  What are they doing?
[03:08:42.831 --> 03:08:54.078]  They're so haughty, they're so arrogant, they're so deluded, that they think by just delaying counting the MAGA votes, the Republican votes, the Kerry-Lake votes, that it's just not going to happen.
[03:08:54.078 --> 03:08:56.339]  Count the frigging votes!
[03:08:56.339 --> 03:08:58.180]  Why does it take a week?
[03:08:58.180 --> 03:09:00.462]  Why does it take two weeks?
[03:09:00.462 --> 03:09:12.229]  Say what you want about Brazil's election and corruption and vote fraud, but at least they claim they can count the votes in one night in Brazil, which by American terms is a pretty backward country.
[03:09:13.271 --> 03:09:13.891]  Arizona?
[03:09:13.891 --> 03:09:14.231]  No.
[03:09:14.231 --> 03:09:17.072]  Maybe next week, maybe Monday, maybe Tuesday.
[03:09:17.072 --> 03:09:19.213]  Who knows at this point?
[03:09:19.213 --> 03:09:24.995]  Absolutely incredible, and in fact Carrie Lake came out today, a few hours ago in an interview.
[03:09:24.995 --> 03:09:26.916]  This is a headline out of Valiant News.
[03:09:26.916 --> 03:09:30.637]  Carrie Lake 100% confident we're going to win.
[03:09:30.637 --> 03:09:35.639]  She was confident she was going to win on Tuesday, but you're not allowed to know that because they're not going to count the votes.
[03:09:36.710 --> 03:09:39.411]  Promises action to stop future election nightmares.
[03:09:39.411 --> 03:09:49.195]  And again, obviously, if she wins, she has presiding control oversight over the election process itself to make sure nothing like this happens again.
[03:09:49.195 --> 03:09:58.258]  So Carrie Lake told Charlie Kirk a few hours ago she's 100% confident she will win as the majority of votes tend to favor Republicans, but they're not counting them.
[03:09:58.258 --> 03:10:00.479]  They're saying, no, we're going to have to wait.
[03:10:00.479 --> 03:10:01.239]  We don't know when.
[03:10:02.031 --> 03:10:04.972]  There's 60,000 here, there's 200,000 there.
[03:10:04.972 --> 03:10:14.973]  We're going to selectively, in a tactical manner, dump certain votes that favour her opponent to try and pretend that she's not going to win.
[03:10:14.973 --> 03:10:27.556]  She promised that as Governor of Arizona, her first action will be to call a special legislative session where the new Republican Congress will be asked to solve the state's infamous election system, where of course they had the massive
[03:10:28.792 --> 03:10:49.684]  Failures in voting machines where 70 out of 223 voting locations now, that's up from 60, were beset with these mysterious problems in those areas and those election day voters, those ballots which heavily skew Republican, that's where they had mysteriously all the problems.
[03:10:49.684 --> 03:10:53.126]  Who could have predicted that?
[03:10:53.126 --> 03:10:55.488]  She said I feel 100% confident we're going to win this.
[03:10:56.849 --> 03:10:58.150]  I'm frustrated like everyone else.
[03:10:58.150 --> 03:11:00.551]  It's embarrassing the way elections are held in Arizona.
[03:11:00.551 --> 03:11:02.392]  This is why I've been sounding the alarm since 2020.
[03:11:02.392 --> 03:11:10.236]  She went on to say yesterday we gave them 24 hours and they released 62,000 votes.
[03:11:10.236 --> 03:11:15.239]  Again, as I pointed out in a video earlier today, who is counting these votes in Arizona?
[03:11:15.239 --> 03:11:16.680]  First grade children?
[03:11:19.068 --> 03:11:20.209]  Who's counting them?
[03:11:20.209 --> 03:11:28.215]  Why haven't they got enough people to count more than 62,000 votes in a time period of 24 hours?
[03:11:28.215 --> 03:11:31.297]  How long does it take to count a single vote?
[03:11:31.297 --> 03:11:37.642]  She added we have 622,000 votes yet to be counted but they're not giving us the results.
[03:11:37.642 --> 03:11:47.069]  And of those, of those 384,000 of people who took their mail-in ballot and walked them in on election day because Republicans knew that if they use the US postal system
[03:11:48.010 --> 03:11:56.654]  If they used any of these Dropbox shenanigans that... up in the air whether the vote will actually count or not, given our previous experience.
[03:11:56.654 --> 03:12:00.915]  She said, I think we all know how the majority of those people were going to vote.
[03:12:00.915 --> 03:12:04.617]  So again, she's still confident that she's going to win this.
[03:12:04.617 --> 03:12:07.638]  She says, of the votes that haven't been counted, if they ever count them...
[03:12:08.792 --> 03:12:15.334]  They're going to be 2-1 Republican, if not 3-1 Republican, in Carrie Lake's favour.
[03:12:15.334 --> 03:12:33.458]  So she's already forming her transition team, even as the predicted markets, the betting markets, even as the Democratic operatives on Twitter, all cry in unison that Carrie Lake is going to lose, despite the fact that the votes remaining to be counted are 2-1, in some cases 3-1, in her favour.
[03:12:35.501 --> 03:12:52.376]  And again, Blake Masters, of course, in the Senate race is further behind, but people who have looked at these voting ballots that remain uncounted say that Blake Masters has a chance of overturning that deficit if they just count the damn ballots.
[03:12:52.376 --> 03:13:00.764]  Of course, if that's the case, Republicans win the Senate, even aside from the runoff in Georgia, which is going to happen in December.
[03:13:00.764 --> 03:13:01.945]  But again, the wider point
[03:13:03.075 --> 03:13:10.340]  Biden has a better midterm than Obama or Bill Clinton despite record and popularity levels.
[03:13:10.340 --> 03:13:17.204]  73% according to the CNN exit poll are either angry or dissatisfied with the way America is heading with the state of the country.
[03:13:17.204 --> 03:13:21.266]  Other polls say that's 75%, an even higher number.
[03:13:21.266 --> 03:13:27.390]  And yet it's the best midterms for Democrats in terms of governors since 1986.
[03:13:27.390 --> 03:13:29.812]  Makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
[03:13:29.812 --> 03:13:31.433]  Bloomberg reported that Biden
[03:13:32.600 --> 03:13:42.384]  Despite his low approval rating and relative absence on the campaign trail, he'll likely be able to claim the best midterm performance for an incumbent's president party in 20 years!
[03:13:42.384 --> 03:13:52.988]  So just like 2020, when he spent half the time in bed, called a lid on it at 12 in the afternoon, 1 in the afternoon, Biden has performed outstanding!
[03:13:54.139 --> 03:14:05.861]  Same as Fetterman, of course, who, like Biden, can barely string together two coherent sentences, absolutely crushed Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania, unconvincingly.
[03:14:05.861 --> 03:14:19.544]  So again, Biden, the most votes for any president ever, despite the fact that he barely got out of bed in 2020, despite the fact that he barely campaigned in 2022, has had an outstanding night, an outstanding couple of days.
[03:14:20.256 --> 03:14:24.278]  You also have the situation in Pennsylvania with Tony DeLuca.
[03:14:24.278 --> 03:14:27.659]  Headline out of RT.
[03:14:27.659 --> 03:14:30.921]  Dead candidates win US elections.
[03:14:30.921 --> 03:14:39.565]  Pennsylvania State Rep Tony DeLuca won his race for State Congress in a landslide victory despite the fact that he's been dead for a month.
[03:14:39.565 --> 03:14:46.528]  You had similar outcomes in Tennessee with Barbara Cooper and with Simon Silver in California.
[03:14:46.528 --> 03:14:48.188]  Both been dead for months.
[03:14:48.188 --> 03:14:49.169]  Both won easily.
[03:14:51.249 --> 03:14:53.910]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:14:53.910 --> 03:15:03.992]  Pima County in Arizona says most of the ballots might be counted by the 14th or 15th next week.
[03:15:03.992 --> 03:15:08.053]  So again we have world elections across the developed world again.
[03:15:08.053 --> 03:15:11.974]  Running elections with tens of millions of voters on one night.
[03:15:11.974 --> 03:15:14.955]  You know the result of the election within hours.
[03:15:14.955 --> 03:15:18.196]  Even backwards countries like Brazil can pull this off.
[03:15:18.869 --> 03:15:27.811]  And yet we have the world's premier superpower, America, with the supposedly sophisticated election system, and they can't get it done.
[03:15:27.811 --> 03:15:32.352]  For a week, if not more, it's absolutely incredible.
[03:15:32.352 --> 03:15:43.975]  They're talking about how many votes are left, they're analysing how many are gonna split for Carrie Lake and for her opponent, and it's quite obvious that Carrie Lake, who is now within, what, I think it was 12,000 last time I checked,
[03:15:44.972 --> 03:15:47.594]  Within 12,000 votes of her opponent, clearly gonna win.
[03:15:47.594 --> 03:15:50.435]  They should have called it yesterday, if not the day before.
[03:15:50.435 --> 03:15:51.956]  It's an absolute farce.
[03:15:51.956 --> 03:15:54.718]  We'll be back, no going.
[03:15:54.718 --> 03:15:59.560]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[03:15:59.560 --> 03:16:06.104]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together.
[03:16:06.104 --> 03:16:07.305]  This family that is InfoWars.
[03:16:09.147 --> 03:16:25.382]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:16:25.382 --> 03:16:34.470]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:37.461]  I don't take the credit.
[03:16:37.461 --> 03:16:39.162]  I give you the credit.
[03:16:39.162 --> 03:16:41.783]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:16:41.783 --> 03:16:43.384]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:16:43.384 --> 03:16:45.225]  Without your support we could be shut down.

[03:17:01.348 --> 03:17:15.139]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world, to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[03:17:57.435 --> 03:18:01.197]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[03:18:01.197 --> 03:18:10.260]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[03:18:10.260 --> 03:18:12.882]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:18:12.882 --> 03:18:19.524]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[03:18:19.524 --> 03:18:20.525]  It has all the minerals.
[03:18:21.065 --> 03:18:26.628]  All the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[03:18:26.628 --> 03:18:29.249]  Essential means without these things you die.
[03:18:29.249 --> 03:18:37.333]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[03:18:37.333 --> 03:18:39.554]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[03:18:40.054 --> 03:18:44.240]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the Infowar.

[03:19:53.222 --> 03:19:55.584]  Visit InfoWareStore.com right now.
[03:19:55.584 --> 03:20:01.489]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.926 --> 03:20:23.372]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:23.372 --> 03:20:31.277]  So I just checked Sennate Race in Arizona on Google, which gets their data from the Associated Press.
[03:20:31.277 --> 03:20:41.424]  There's live updated at 20.20 GMT, which is my time, 20 past 8 in the evening, 20 past 2 Central in Austin, where we're broadcasting from.
[03:20:42.958 --> 03:20:45.560]  And it still says the same thing it said yesterday.
[03:20:45.560 --> 03:20:49.963]  70% reporting in Arizona.
[03:20:49.963 --> 03:20:51.203]  70% of the ballots are in.
[03:20:51.203 --> 03:20:52.945]  That was what it was yesterday.
[03:20:52.945 --> 03:20:56.087]  What have they been doing all day?
[03:20:56.087 --> 03:20:58.889]  This is a national midterm election.
[03:20:58.889 --> 03:21:01.290]  There's been almost 24 hours gone by.
[03:21:01.290 --> 03:21:05.553]  No new votes reported, according to the Associated Press.
[03:21:05.553 --> 03:21:10.096]  Some other news outlets, some trackers have different metrics, of course.
[03:21:10.096 --> 03:21:11.637]  But they're just not updating it.
[03:21:12.836 --> 03:21:15.057]  I mean, what is wrong with these people?
[03:21:15.057 --> 03:21:16.798]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:16.798 --> 03:21:19.320]  Nevada, Adam Laxalt still winning.
[03:21:19.320 --> 03:21:21.961]  83% reporting.
[03:21:21.961 --> 03:21:25.443]  That hasn't been updated since yesterday, as far as I know.
[03:21:25.443 --> 03:21:28.585]  I mean, just call it already.
[03:21:28.585 --> 03:21:29.746]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:21:31.351 --> 03:21:33.352]  Then you could drill down into the other numbers, of course.
[03:21:33.352 --> 03:21:37.975]  There's a lot of black pills flying around over the past couple of days with Republicans.
[03:21:37.975 --> 03:21:42.117]  Some people saying the Trump candidates underperformed because Trump is toxic.
[03:21:42.117 --> 03:21:45.239]  There's no more room for Trump, that he should step aside.
[03:21:45.239 --> 03:21:46.920]  It's time for DeSantis.
[03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:56.025]  Other people saying the GOP establishment sabotaged Trump candidates, withdrew the funding, even used funding to attack them.
[03:21:56.025 --> 03:21:57.226]  In the primaries, of course,
[03:21:58.439 --> 03:21:59.840]  That's a different debate.
[03:21:59.840 --> 03:22:09.143]  If you actually drill down into the stats, as we're presented with them, 70% of 18 to 19 year olds vote a Democrat.
[03:22:09.143 --> 03:22:11.384]  And this is literally the TikTok vote.
[03:22:11.384 --> 03:22:15.345]  In fact, top Democrat operatives came out and celebrated this on the night.
[03:22:15.345 --> 03:22:19.187]  One saying, if not for voters under 30, tonight would have been a red wave.
[03:22:19.187 --> 03:22:23.368]  The argument is, oh, as they get older, more and more of them will vote Republican.
[03:22:23.368 --> 03:22:24.709]  They'll stop voting Democrat.
[03:22:25.276 --> 03:22:27.658]  But again, these people are 18 to 29 years old.
[03:22:27.658 --> 03:22:29.239]  How long is that going to take?
[03:22:29.239 --> 03:22:29.539]  20 years?
[03:22:29.539 --> 03:22:30.980]  30 years?
[03:22:30.980 --> 03:22:33.462]  Do we really have that length of time?
[03:22:33.462 --> 03:22:51.015]  Given the stats on migrant voters, obviously second, third generation, where you have a situation where the percentage of white voters, 73% white voters, making up the total voting population, 73%, 58% voted Republican,
[03:22:54.116 --> 03:23:00.617]  But then you have 27% non-white voters across the entire United States.
[03:23:00.617 --> 03:23:03.118]  And I think the numbers were what?
[03:23:03.118 --> 03:23:04.698]  68% voted for Democrat.
[03:23:04.698 --> 03:23:15.701]  If you continue to have mass migration, if you continue to have a complete absence of border control, anchor babies and everything that goes with it, that's just going to get worse every two years.
[03:23:16.588 --> 03:23:28.634]  Media says you're not even allowed to talk about replacement migration because it's a dangerous right-wing conspiracy theory, yet in every single election we see those numbers creep up time and time again.
[03:23:28.634 --> 03:23:37.439]  And again, going back to the Zoomer thing, no Republican in any key race campaigned via TikTok videos.
[03:23:37.439 --> 03:23:42.201]  In the most competitive Senate races, and NBC News reported on this before the election,
[03:23:43.021 --> 03:23:49.006]  The four top Democrats in those key battleground Senate races posted regularly to TikTok.
[03:23:49.006 --> 03:23:52.629]  TikTok is absolutely huge and it's only getting bigger.
[03:23:52.629 --> 03:24:00.135]  Just because the Republican Party barely understands what it is and doesn't use it at all, that's not an excuse.
[03:24:00.135 --> 03:24:06.480]  They're posting 10-second cringe dance videos on TikTok, Beto O'Rourke and all these other candidates.
[03:24:06.480 --> 03:24:09.203]  Not in his case, obviously, because he got crushed.
[03:24:09.203 --> 03:24:10.804]  But this is how they're reaching the Zoomers.
[03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:28.033]  Cell phone addicted, 10 second attention span Generation Z. They're watching these cringe TikTok dance routines and they're saying, I'm going to go out and vote Democrat because I want to have promiscuous degenerate sex until I'm 30, 35.
[03:24:28.033 --> 03:24:30.916]  And if someone gets pregnant, I need to terminate the baby.
[03:24:30.916 --> 03:24:38.682]  That's how they're reaching Generation Z. So again, Republicans pretending that that doesn't exist as a key demographic.
[03:24:39.227 --> 03:24:48.211]  And ignoring how to do proper outreach by campaigning on TikTok is partly why they got absolutely crushed in that Zuma vote.
[03:24:48.211 --> 03:25:04.837]  Of course, TikTok being what is the most censorious platform in terms of social media in existence ever, they will ban conservative content on a whim because of their mass flagging system, where if you say anything right of Stalin you get your account nuked straight away.
[03:25:04.837 --> 03:25:06.638]  Big problem!
[03:25:06.638 --> 03:25:06.958]  I mean, we...
[03:25:07.737 --> 03:25:20.507]  People will claim we've solved it to some degree with Elon taking over Twitter, but you really need to focus on TikTok for the 2024 presidential election because that is where the Zuma vote lies.
[03:25:20.507 --> 03:25:30.695]  We also had the issue of abortion on the ballot in numerous states, including the deep red states of Kentucky and Montana.
[03:25:30.695 --> 03:25:35.458]  They had a measure which would have asserted there's no right to abortion in the Kentucky state constitution.
[03:25:35.458 --> 03:25:37.280]  That failed in Kentucky.
[03:25:38.243 --> 03:25:50.451]  We also had a measure in Montana, Deep Red State, which would have criminalized healthcare workers not trying to save the life of a living baby after birth.
[03:25:50.451 --> 03:25:52.993]  That failed in Montana.
[03:25:52.993 --> 03:25:54.214]  Really?
[03:25:54.214 --> 03:25:56.856]  If that's true, then that is a huge black pill.
[03:25:56.856 --> 03:26:04.541]  They're literally saying a child born either during abortion prematurely should be left to die outside the womb.
[03:26:05.183 --> 03:26:09.305]  And they passed that, or didn't pass it in that case, in Montana.
[03:26:09.305 --> 03:26:11.986]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:26:11.986 --> 03:26:29.133]  The other argument, aside from the GOP establishment sabotaging MAGA candidates, is that all this talk of a red wave produced some kind of lax, blasé overconfidence within Republican voters, and many of them couldn't be arsed to get off the sofa and go and vote.
[03:26:29.133 --> 03:26:30.294]  They thought it was a done deal.
[03:26:30.294 --> 03:26:31.254]  They thought it was a lock-in.
[03:26:31.914 --> 03:26:36.536]  We were told before the election that the Congress, the House, was in absolute lock-in.
[03:26:36.536 --> 03:26:40.397]  Massive, giant, overwhelming Republican gains.
[03:26:40.397 --> 03:26:53.803]  Now they're still fighting, struggling, as we wait until next week, or next month, or next year, whenever the heck it will be, to actually achieve that five-seat gain that they needed to take the House.
[03:26:53.803 --> 03:26:56.344]  I mean, it's still probable they will, but it's not certain.
[03:26:57.822 --> 03:27:07.208]  So was there vast overconfidence, naivety, blasé thinking in the fact that Republicans didn't get off their arse, didn't get off the sofa and go and vote?
[03:27:07.208 --> 03:27:10.190]  There's also the question about independence.
[03:27:10.190 --> 03:27:27.260]  Did they really buy into this hysteria, which was funnelled through the legacy media in the weeks before the vote, that if the Republicans performed well facilitating the return of Trump, Trump of course expected to make an announcement within days, whether that happens will remain to be seen,
[03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:38.676]  But if Republicans won big this time around, that would mean Trump would become the dictator, there'd be no more elections ever again, and Republicans would literally try to kill your kids.
[03:27:38.676 --> 03:27:43.439]  That's actually what top Democrats got up on NBC News and other platforms and said.
[03:27:43.439 --> 03:27:45.199]  Did they actually believe that?
[03:27:45.199 --> 03:27:55.065]  And did they go out and vote for Democrats in far larger numbers than we expected, really believing that the voting system democracy itself was at risk?
[03:27:56.445 --> 03:28:00.206]  I suggest not, but apparently that's one of the arguments going around.
[03:28:00.206 --> 03:28:05.167]  Meanwhile, Biden says he plans to change nothing in the wake of red wave evaporating.
[03:28:05.167 --> 03:28:06.847]  So, of course, you still have these polls.
[03:28:06.847 --> 03:28:15.028]  73% on a CNN exit poll, 75% on other polls saying they were angry or dissatisfied with the way the country was going.
[03:28:15.028 --> 03:28:19.669]  Did that mean Biden would want to change any of his approach going into the next two years?
[03:28:19.669 --> 03:28:25.190]  No, he told reporters today that he planned to change absolutely nothing.
[03:28:26.497 --> 03:28:29.038]  Analyst warns there probably won't be an election in 2024.
[03:28:29.038 --> 03:28:49.129]  This is Martin Armstrong, who's been very accurate in his previous predictions, saying there may not be an election in 2024 and that United States may not exist after 2032 due to massive societal upheaval and financial collapse and people not trusting the election system to run fair to even count their votes.
[03:28:49.129 --> 03:28:49.649]  Incredible.
[03:28:49.649 --> 03:28:50.189]  We'll be back.
[03:28:50.189 --> 03:28:50.790]  Summit.News.
[03:28:50.790 --> 03:28:51.210]  Don't go away.
[03:28:57.535 --> 03:29:00.378]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[03:29:00.378 --> 03:29:02.420]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[03:29:02.420 --> 03:29:04.423]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[03:29:04.423 --> 03:29:06.485]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[03:29:06.485 --> 03:29:08.207]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[03:29:08.207 --> 03:29:10.609]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[03:29:10.609 --> 03:29:12.031]  You forget to take the X3.
[03:29:12.031 --> 03:29:13.533]  And you know it makes your life better.
[03:29:13.533 --> 03:29:14.994]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[03:29:14.994 --> 03:29:16.155]  And you constantly forget.
[03:29:16.155 --> 03:29:18.118]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[03:29:18.758 --> 03:29:21.700]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[03:29:57.008 --> 03:30:00.770]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[03:30:00.770 --> 03:30:09.435]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[03:30:09.435 --> 03:30:12.437]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[03:30:12.437 --> 03:30:19.100]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.

[03:30:20.641 --> 03:30:26.205]  All the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[03:30:26.205 --> 03:30:28.807]  Essential means without these things you die.

[03:32:33.706 --> 03:32:35.127]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:32:35.127 --> 03:32:36.168]  And the list goes on and on.
[03:32:36.448 --> 03:32:39.170]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.302 --> 03:33:34.927]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:38.131 --> 03:33:44.916]  You're back and let's get into some of the COVID news because yes, COVID still is a thing.
[03:33:44.916 --> 03:33:50.060]  I read today that they're talking about discovering a deadly new variant.
[03:33:50.060 --> 03:33:58.306]  Still threatening that there could be new, more deadlier variants than Omicron, which wouldn't be hard because it was basically less than the common cold.
[03:33:58.306 --> 03:34:04.751]  I've literally had the latest version of COVID now about three times over the past three months.
[03:34:05.473 --> 03:34:07.755]  I've had way worse colds.
[03:34:07.755 --> 03:34:12.138]  It was literally a 10-12 hour thing and I'm completely over it.
[03:34:12.138 --> 03:34:18.582]  Yet they're still fear-mongering, they're still brow-beating into the public that it's going to come back.
[03:34:18.582 --> 03:34:24.387]  Whether that is this winter or not, whether they try to introduce, reintroduce all the restrictions remains to be seen.
[03:34:24.387 --> 03:34:25.648]  We have this story today.
[03:34:25.648 --> 03:34:31.652]  Pfizer boasts of multi-billion dollar Covid vaccine franchise as it marks up price of vaccine.
[03:34:32.344 --> 03:34:32.584]  By 10,000%!
[03:34:32.584 --> 03:34:36.305]  Keep taking your booster.
[03:34:36.305 --> 03:34:46.888]  This is Pfizer's chief financial officer who boasted in an earnings call with investors, David Denton, that the virus had become, quote, somewhat like the flu.
[03:34:46.888 --> 03:34:47.828]  Can't say that.
[03:34:47.828 --> 03:34:51.109]  Six months ago, if you said that, you'd be banned and deplatformed.
[03:34:51.109 --> 03:34:52.630]  But more deadly.
[03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:58.651]  And that the vaccines and antivirals produced by Pfizer to combat it will be relevant for many years to come.
[03:34:58.651 --> 03:35:00.392]  And that's quite convenient for them, isn't it?
[03:35:01.047 --> 03:35:09.311]  Because they want to meet a projected revenue target this year of £32 billion on the Covid vaccine and the antivirals alone.
[03:35:09.311 --> 03:35:16.615]  How are they going to do that after previously receiving £80 billion in profit from sales of Covid vaccines?
[03:35:16.615 --> 03:35:19.696]  Well, they're going to triple the price and they're going to mark it up by 10,000%.
[03:35:21.980 --> 03:35:34.825]  So they previously charged governments $19 to $30 for each dose of the vaccine, and they're going to hike that up to $130, presumably because far less people are going to take it.
[03:35:34.825 --> 03:35:36.986]  So they need to make that margin.
[03:35:36.986 --> 03:35:40.268]  So they're going to hike it by 10,000%.
[03:35:40.268 --> 03:35:47.551]  Peter May Barduck, Director of Access to Medicines at Public Citizen, said Pfizer had already made obscene profits.
[03:35:47.551 --> 03:35:47.771]  No.
[03:35:47.771 --> 03:35:50.372]  $80 billion profit?
[03:35:50.372 --> 03:35:51.012]  That's not enough.
[03:35:51.778 --> 03:36:05.302]  With the company having grossed £40 billion in 2019, £41 billion in 2020, and a projected revenue of total pharmaceutical sales of £102 billion in total revenue this year.
[03:36:05.302 --> 03:36:06.542]  No, it's not enough.
[03:36:06.542 --> 03:36:07.882]  They need more!
[03:36:07.882 --> 03:36:09.963]  Take your booster!
[03:36:09.963 --> 03:36:16.705]  Meanwhile, striking correlation between autumn vaccine boosters and excess deaths in England, as total non-COVID excess deaths topped 23,000,
[03:36:18.931 --> 03:36:25.514]  This is still a situation that's developing in the United Kingdom with barely any media attention.
[03:36:25.514 --> 03:36:27.275]  The excess deaths crisis continues.
[03:36:27.275 --> 03:36:33.519]  1,232 excess deaths, 12.3% above the five-year average.
[03:36:33.519 --> 03:36:36.980]  Again, when there were excess deaths due to Covid, everybody freaked out about it.
[03:36:36.980 --> 03:36:40.482]  When it's probably due to the vaccine, nobody cares.
[03:36:40.482 --> 03:36:45.565]  Registered in England and Wales in the week ending October 28th, according to the ONS.
[03:36:46.363 --> 03:36:55.230]  Of these, 804 were attributed to an underlying cause other than COVID-19, bringing the total excess non-COVID deaths since the wave began in April to 23,000.
[03:36:55.230 --> 03:37:02.076]  They're saying that many of the high excess deaths are heart-related.
[03:37:02.076 --> 03:37:03.697]  What a surprise!
[03:37:03.697 --> 03:37:08.021]  They continued throughout the summer and didn't drop off as the booster campaign finished.
[03:37:08.021 --> 03:37:11.964]  And as the graph shows in this article on dailysceptic.org,
[03:37:13.211 --> 03:37:21.642]  The boosters are directly in correlation with the excess deaths, but I'm sure that is just a coincidence and no one needs to worry about it.
[03:37:21.642 --> 03:37:22.944]  Get your seventh booster.
[03:37:22.944 --> 03:37:26.529]  Pfizer needs 102 billion more in profits this year.
[03:37:27.463 --> 03:37:32.266]  Meanwhile, Covid commemoration, you must be joking, again in the United Kingdom.
[03:37:32.266 --> 03:37:49.955]  Of course, we had the loyalty oath to the regime here for about a period of six to seven months, which was people literally going outside their front doors at 8pm every night and applauding the NHS, the health workers, as they were busy doing TikTok dances in empty hospitals.
[03:37:49.955 --> 03:37:54.297]  It was a loyalty oath to the regime, to the narrative, to the message.
[03:37:54.297 --> 03:37:56.438]  And now, in a sense, they're trying to bring this back
[03:37:57.409 --> 03:38:17.192]  We have a new commission in the UK which is suggesting we remember those who lost their lives and those who cared for those in need when the hospitals were 40% empty as well as those who kept our essential services running by having a commemoration and they're trying to decide on which day we have this commemoration, a National Day of Remembrance.
[03:38:17.961 --> 03:38:19.762]  Of course, this will be completely hijacked.
[03:38:19.762 --> 03:38:24.245]  It won't be a day of remembrance for any of the people who died from vaccine injuries.
[03:38:24.245 --> 03:38:29.829]  It will be a day of regime narrative loyalty oath reinforcement.
[03:38:29.829 --> 03:38:34.972]  So they're saying, should it be on March the 5th, the announcement of the first COVID death in the UK?
[03:38:34.972 --> 03:38:39.595]  Or should it be on March the 11th, which is when the WHO declared the pandemic?
[03:38:39.595 --> 03:38:42.577]  Again, in homage to the WHO.
[03:38:42.577 --> 03:38:47.320]  Should it be March the 23rd, which was the date when the UK was placed under lockdown?
[03:38:48.234 --> 03:39:10.529]  So they're literally pushing potentially the anniversary of lockdown to be the Covid commemoration day to bolster the crumbling regime narrative that lockdown was anything other than an absolute outrage which will end up killing more people than Covid virus could ever dream to kill.
[03:39:10.529 --> 03:39:16.213]  The thousands of untreated cancers, people not being allowed to go to funerals to bury their own parents.
[03:39:17.725 --> 03:39:20.767]  Suicide rates spiking in young children.
[03:39:20.767 --> 03:39:26.071]  Speech-delayed developments in toddlers now soaring 300, 400 percent.
[03:39:26.071 --> 03:39:28.693]  Knock-on effects for years and years to come.
[03:39:28.693 --> 03:39:32.835]  Economic decline, poverty, death for years and years to come.
[03:39:32.835 --> 03:39:37.979]  Now they're saying we need to have a day to commemorate all that, like it was a good thing.
[03:39:37.979 --> 03:39:41.461]  Absolutely disgraceful.
[03:39:41.461 --> 03:39:45.844]  Meanwhile, research countries that saw zero Covid lockdowns have the least immunity.
[03:39:45.844 --> 03:39:46.885]  Oh my God, what a sprite!
[03:39:48.419 --> 03:40:06.926]  Who knew that locking yourself indoors for two years and not even exposing your body to viruses, developing natural immunity, which is what's protected the human body from viruses for millennia, that that would lead to people having bad immune systems that don't function properly anymore.
[03:40:06.926 --> 03:40:10.007]  I went to a family wedding a couple of weeks ago,
[03:40:10.825 --> 03:40:20.309]  With elderly people, generally, who had had three or four vaccines, half of them had COVID and were spluttering into their face masks.
[03:40:20.309 --> 03:40:24.871]  Half of them weren't even able to attend the wedding because they were at home with COVID.
[03:40:24.871 --> 03:40:28.532]  Again, all triple or quadruple jabbed.
[03:40:28.532 --> 03:40:30.373]  I was fine.
[03:40:30.373 --> 03:40:32.334]  Unvax healthy immune system.
[03:40:34.412 --> 03:40:44.495]  New research has revealed that countries that implemented the harshest lockdowns as part of the zero Covid policies, which of course China is now continuing, now have the least immunity from the virus itself.
[03:40:44.495 --> 03:40:58.079]  This is a study by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, University of Washington, which estimates that China, which still has multiple lockdowns in place, has the lowest level of immunity to Covid-19 on the planet.
[03:40:58.079 --> 03:40:58.779]  And yet they're still
[03:40:59.756 --> 03:41:17.208]  Announcing snap Covid lockdowns where people are literally in shopping malls and supermarkets and they announce a snap Covid lockdown and they all pile out the door to try and get home before they're arrested and thrown in a containment gulag, a quarantine gulag.
[03:41:17.208 --> 03:41:19.670]  Absolutely incredible that that is even still happening.
[03:41:20.726 --> 03:41:30.571]  Other nations that didn't institute harsh lockdowns, including Russia, Singapore and Brazil, are thought to have the highest immunity levels, so all those countries are recovering way quicker.
[03:41:30.571 --> 03:41:40.175]  Then of course you look at Sweden, which was absolutely savage during the early days of the Covid lockdowns, as basically accusing the government of killing their own people.
[03:41:40.175 --> 03:41:41.396]  Guess which country?
[03:41:42.185 --> 03:41:51.772]  Has the lowest pandemic mortality in the entire world as we move, what, two and a half years past the first Covid lockdown?
[03:41:51.772 --> 03:41:52.752]  It's Sweden.
[03:41:52.752 --> 03:41:54.474]  What a surprise.
[03:41:54.474 --> 03:42:07.943]  And as this article points out again in the Daily Skeptic, Sweden did much, much better, ten times better than Chile, notorious for having the strictest lockdowns despite also having one of the most successful vaccination campaigns
[03:42:08.593 --> 03:42:25.966]  So, Chile vaccinated vast quantities of their population, strictest, most draconian, most totalitarian lockdown in the early days, and it has exceedingly high mortality rates, whereas Sweden is right at the top of this table, and that's a good thing being at the top of the table,
[03:42:26.644 --> 03:42:49.696]  For having low Covid mortality, Sweden, of course, having not locked down, having not forced their population to wear masks, and having not enforced the vaccination vaccine mandates, preventing people from going out, going to bars, restaurants, travelling, more so than any of its neighbours, any other European country, Sweden has come out on top, exactly as we predicted.
[03:42:49.696 --> 03:42:51.277]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[03:42:51.277 --> 03:42:51.517]  Now go away.
[03:42:54.946 --> 03:43:00.931]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[03:43:02.242 --> 03:43:12.611]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:43:12.611 --> 03:43:25.362]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:43:26.042 --> 03:43:26.803]  We're good to go!
[03:43:55.154 --> 03:43:56.714]  Look around you.
[03:43:56.714 --> 03:44:01.735]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[03:44:01.735 --> 03:44:05.636]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[03:44:05.636 --> 03:44:14.958]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[03:44:14.958 --> 03:44:20.619]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[03:44:20.619 --> 03:44:24.220]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[03:44:25.080 --> 03:44:34.467]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[03:44:34.467 --> 03:44:35.768]  It's unsustainable.
[03:44:35.768 --> 03:44:40.052]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[03:44:40.052 --> 03:44:48.178]  SaveInfoWars.com, where you can make straight donations, $5, $10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.

[03:44:52.481 --> 03:44:53.582]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[03:45:50.827 --> 03:45:53.828]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[03:45:54.804 --> 03:45:58.288]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[03:45:58.288 --> 03:46:01.432]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[03:46:01.432 --> 03:46:03.053]  Now, I knew that.
[03:46:03.053 --> 03:46:05.877]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people.
[03:46:05.877 --> 03:46:07.298]  And together, we've had a great effect.
[03:46:07.298 --> 03:46:09.781]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[03:46:09.781 --> 03:46:10.942]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:46:10.942 --> 03:46:14.066]  But they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.

[03:46:38.291 --> 03:46:39.591]  We're good to go.
[03:47:08.769 --> 03:47:15.873]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:47:15.873 --> 03:47:26.959]  I've got three quick videos that I want to throw to in this final segment, but first we need to talk about this, and it's something I've predicted.
[03:47:28.098 --> 03:47:32.562]  UK man sent to prison for six months for serving snacks at club during lockdown.
[03:47:32.562 --> 03:47:42.391]  Again, we've literally got police dancing the Macarena at gay pride parades, arresting pregnant mothers in their own kitchen for being transphobic on Twitter.
[03:47:42.391 --> 03:47:48.156]  But they're really cracking down on the hardcore criminals because a 72 year old man has been sentenced to six months in prison
[03:47:48.909 --> 03:47:55.730]  The crime of serving mince pies with wine at his shooting club in 2020 while the area was under a lockdown.
[03:47:55.730 --> 03:48:06.613]  BBC reports Maurice Snelling broke tier three restrictions at Cloudside Shooting Grounds in 2020 by allowing people to sit in at his premises rather than take away.
[03:48:06.613 --> 03:48:10.814]  Oh my god, the absolute gall of it!
[03:48:10.814 --> 03:48:12.414]  Mr Snelling pleaded guilty
[03:48:13.385 --> 03:48:14.666]  God knows why.
[03:48:14.666 --> 03:48:16.747]  Probably couldn't afford a proper lawyer.
[03:48:16.747 --> 03:48:24.811]  So perverting the course of just argued that his club was in the area where restriction state visitors could sit inside and consume drinks if they were accompanied by food.
[03:48:24.811 --> 03:48:27.832]  So he's basically broken a technicality.
[03:48:27.832 --> 03:48:33.395]  This stupid farcical thing at the time where they had to, for example, if you went into a pub,
[03:48:34.184 --> 03:48:39.990]  You couldn't just have a pint of beer, you had to have a scotch egg, because then the pub would be classified as a restaurant.
[03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:44.714]  He violated that technicality, and now he faces six months in prison.
[03:48:44.714 --> 03:48:46.576]  Absolute clown world.
[03:48:46.576 --> 03:48:53.182]  And on the subject of crime in the United Kingdom, let's go to this video now, because again, I predicted this a year ago.
[03:48:53.182 --> 03:48:56.465]  This video is called, I Knew This Would Happen.
[03:48:56.465 --> 03:48:57.086]  Let's roll it.
[03:48:57.878 --> 03:49:00.520]  Well, they're still not listening to a word we say.
[03:49:00.520 --> 03:49:04.862]  Partly thanks to woke policing, we've now reached an ominous milestone.
[03:49:04.862 --> 03:49:12.687]  Crime in England and Wales just hit an all-time high, while police are solving the lowest proportion of crimes on record.
[03:49:12.687 --> 03:49:13.507]  A Telegraph report
[03:49:13.727 --> 03:49:21.273]  Only 5.4% of all crimes resulted in a charge in the year to June equivalent to just over 1 in 20 offences being solved.
[03:49:21.273 --> 03:49:29.419]  That represents a fall from 6.5% in the previous year and is just a third of the charging rate of 15.5% seven years ago when records began.
[03:49:29.419 --> 03:49:35.063]  Recorded offences also hit 6.5 million, an all-time historic high.
[03:49:35.063 --> 03:49:38.345]  Gee, I wonder what could have been happening to exacerbate all this?
[03:49:38.345 --> 03:49:40.047]  MENTOR JONES HAS
[03:49:41.963 --> 03:49:52.556]  I mean, police may not be able to respond to burglaries, car thefts, and all manner of other crimes, but you can sleep safe tonight, comforted by the thought that the real criminals are on the run.
[03:49:52.556 --> 03:49:58.663]  Like this wife of a priest and mother of five who was arrested in her own home for posting offensive things about transgenders on the internet.
[03:49:58.803 --> 03:50:01.104]  But political correctness is just being nice to people!
[03:50:01.104 --> 03:50:01.425]  No it isn't!
[03:50:19.215 --> 03:50:23.860]  This is yet another example where political correctness leads to real world harm.
[03:50:23.860 --> 03:50:31.868]  The more resources you devote to policing people's speech, the fewer resources will be left to prevent and investigate actual crimes.
[03:50:31.868 --> 03:50:37.174]  Liz Truss promised to do something about all this when she was Prime Minister for about five minutes.
[03:50:37.174 --> 03:50:39.697]  What has Rishi Sunak promised to do about it?
[03:50:40.057 --> 03:50:40.678]  Nothing!
[03:50:40.678 --> 03:50:48.328]  Meanwhile, police are telling members of the public not to intervene when just-stop oil activists break the law by blocking major roads.
[03:50:48.328 --> 03:50:50.271]  Oh, just let the police handle it.
[03:50:50.271 --> 03:50:52.054]  Yeah, and what are the police doing?
[03:50:52.054 --> 03:50:52.654]  Nothing!
[03:50:52.654 --> 03:50:56.500]  Giving them cups of tea, counselling and dancing with them in the street.
[03:51:01.749 --> 03:51:09.834]  Maybe if you get the activists to call you a mean name or post an insult on Twitter, they'll send the riot cops steaming in no questions asked.
[03:51:12.731 --> 03:51:16.875]  Breitbart reports stop debating gender on Twitter and solve real crimes.
[03:51:16.875 --> 03:51:28.607]  Braverman tells police chiefs this is UK Home Secretary Suella Braverman who has called on the British police to focus on solving actual crimes rather than debating gender on Twitter in a new speech.
[03:51:28.607 --> 03:51:33.972]  Of course Suella Braverman being the Home Secretary actually trying to crack down on illegal migration
[03:51:34.372 --> 03:51:42.395]  Well, we now have a situation where these boat migrants are arriving on British shores and then just running off into local towns and committing crimes.
[03:51:42.395 --> 03:51:46.697]  We had a case two weeks ago of one breaking into a woman's home.
[03:51:46.697 --> 03:51:56.581]  Local residents are now having to arm themselves with baseball bats or whatever they can get their hands on to defend their homes against illegal migrants invading British shores.
[03:51:56.581 --> 03:52:01.563]  But people were more outraged about Suella Braverman using the word invasion.
[03:52:02.225 --> 03:52:19.621]  And on that subject, let's go to this video, because previously the British government were housing migrants at taxpayer expense of £7 million a day in four-star hotels, but now they're actually housing them in five-star hotels in absolute luxury.
[03:52:19.621 --> 03:52:22.623]  This video is called It Beggars Belief.
[03:52:22.623 --> 03:52:23.084]  Here it is.
[03:52:23.993 --> 03:52:24.934]  Here we go again.
[03:52:24.934 --> 03:52:26.116]  Every day, I think.
[03:52:26.116 --> 03:52:28.018]  Surely it can't get any worse.
[03:52:28.018 --> 03:52:29.040]  Then it gets even worse!
[03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:35.528]  Yesterday I told you about the four-star hotel in Central Ipswich being used to house illegal boat migrants.
[03:52:35.528 --> 03:52:36.709]  Four-star?
[03:52:36.709 --> 03:52:37.851]  That's for peasants!
[03:52:37.851 --> 03:52:40.655]  The Sun reports that the government is now using some...
[03:52:41.135 --> 03:52:47.663]  Five-star hotels to house illegal migrants at taxpayer expense of seven million pounds a day.
[03:52:47.663 --> 03:52:56.314]  One in four of the hotels used to house them are rated in the top brackets, denoting class, and some high-end resorts nationwide are being blocked, booked for months.
[03:52:56.374 --> 03:53:06.600]  Home office officials are sitting refreshing booking.com in the hunt for more capacity, a source said, pushing up prices for Brits looking to go away at Christmas and the new year has supply dwindles.
[03:53:06.600 --> 03:53:13.724]  Great Hallingbury Manor, a four-star Tudor-style hotel in Essex, is now being used to house migrants.
[03:53:13.724 --> 03:53:19.247]  It has 44 double rooms, 20 rooms and chalets, and it's wooded grounds and its own lake, picnic area and barbecue.
[03:53:19.247 --> 03:53:22.008]  That's better accommodation than most Brits can afford.
[03:53:22.008 --> 03:53:22.589]  But get this...
[03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:25.410]  It's still not good enough for the migrants.
[03:53:25.410 --> 03:53:34.732]  According to one employee, quote, they have the run of the hotel, the bedrooms are very comfortable, three meals a day, but some have complained about the food.
[03:53:34.732 --> 03:53:37.713]  No doubt they're whining about the Wi-Fi connection too.
[03:53:37.713 --> 03:53:41.114]  Maybe the evening turndown service just isn't up to par.
[03:53:41.114 --> 03:53:43.895]  The employee also revealed, quote, there are about 50 men
[03:53:45.235 --> 03:53:48.357]  All between 20 to 40 from North Africa.
[03:53:48.357 --> 03:53:54.500]  Again, all young men, no women or children, economic migrants, not refugees!
[03:53:54.500 --> 03:54:00.003]  Another hotel being used for the same purpose is the Dolphin Inn beside the River Grey Ouse in St Ives.
[03:54:00.003 --> 03:54:09.188]  Inside the hotel, which has a glorious view opposite a 15th century bridge, they could be seen enjoying digital big screen TVs and using gym gear moved into their rooms.
[03:54:09.188 --> 03:54:13.270]  One local said people used to spend a fortune to stay here or live along the river,
[03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:14.751]  So they're doing very well.
[03:54:14.751 --> 03:54:22.518]  Meanwhile, new census data reveals that one in six people now living in England and Wales were born in a foreign country.
[03:54:22.518 --> 03:54:27.422]  This was all started by the Blair government and rapidly accelerated by the Tories.
[03:54:27.422 --> 03:54:35.710]  And yet there's still more outrage about overcrowding at the Manston facility and Suella Braverman using a mean word.
[03:54:38.743 --> 03:54:42.766]  Now there are so many of these boat migrants coming into the South Coast right now.
[03:54:42.766 --> 03:54:51.452]  Again, some of them being given a taxi service by our own border force at the behest of leftist NGOs who are working with criminal people smugglers.
[03:54:51.452 --> 03:55:01.399]  There are so many coming in that they can't buy up enough four and five star hotels on the outskirts of major cities to house all these migrants in.
[03:55:01.399 --> 03:55:02.840]  Of course, the previous system
[03:55:03.527 --> 03:55:19.478]  Worked in which they would buy up parts of hotels, they would rent parts of hotels, the government would pay the hotels to rent the rooms for migrants, but then you had holidaymakers, tourists staying in the same hotels and they would of course be aghast at the behaviour of the migrants.
[03:55:19.478 --> 03:55:33.028]  Now they have to buy up entire hotels and that's happening in Ipswich where they now have to buy up major tourist area hotels in the centre of major towns and cities in Britain to house these migrants because there are so many coming in.
[03:55:33.689 --> 03:55:35.230]  They're just running out of space.
[03:55:35.230 --> 03:55:41.875]  People are booking months in advance, posh hotels, four, five-star hotels for their wedding celebrations.
[03:55:41.875 --> 03:55:54.625]  The hotels are phoning them up and saying, no, your wedding is cancelled because we need to house illegal migrants, four out of ten of whom are coming from Albania, a country which isn't even at war.
[03:55:54.625 --> 03:56:01.390]  They're drug dealers, they're criminals, and we're just housing them at taxpayer expense in four- and five-star hotels.
[03:56:02.412 --> 03:56:09.955]  Then you get situations like that that happened up in Wigan in Northern England where some of these migrants obviously they get bored, they've got nothing to do.
[03:56:10.635 --> 03:56:16.100]  They go around harassing and stalking women in a hotel near Wigan where these migrants were staying.
[03:56:16.100 --> 03:56:25.287]  You have a high school nearby where 12, 13, 14 year old girls are walking home from school getting filmed, getting harassed, sexually harassed by the migrants.
[03:56:25.287 --> 03:56:31.853]  They're literally filming the PE lessons in schools because they're perverts and it's a major problem.
[03:56:31.853 --> 03:56:37.498]  The schools are having to tell the parents in these areas to not let their daughters go outside.
[03:56:38.078 --> 03:56:44.566]  Breitbart reports people afraid to walk the streets as one-fifth of Irish town now migrants.
[03:56:44.566 --> 03:56:52.375]  This is Kilkenny in Ireland where migrants now reportedly make up over one-fifth of the population.
[03:56:52.375 --> 03:56:56.760]  They had a population, total population of about 10,000 in this town in Ireland.
[03:56:57.944 --> 03:57:00.945]  Now they've let in 3,200 asylum seekers.
[03:57:00.945 --> 03:57:04.526]  They've literally let in about a third.
[03:57:04.526 --> 03:57:10.167]  Increased the size of the population of the town by a third within a matter of months.
[03:57:10.167 --> 03:57:14.508]  And now the people are afraid to walk the streets because these migrants are committing crimes.
[03:57:14.508 --> 03:57:15.968]  They're harassing people.
[03:57:15.968 --> 03:57:18.129]  They're harassing their daughters.
[03:57:18.129 --> 03:57:22.430]  Publication of Irish newspaper, which these individuals report these incidents to,
[03:57:23.419 --> 03:57:29.684]  Describe themselves as, quote, living in fear and our government is inviting them all in.
[03:57:29.684 --> 03:57:35.369]  We can't deport them because the leftist NGOs and the activists say that that's mean and that's nasty.
[03:57:35.369 --> 03:57:37.651]  It's an absolute farce.
[03:57:37.651 --> 03:57:39.032]  That's going to wrap it up for Summit News.
[03:57:39.032 --> 03:57:41.575]  Our War Room is coming up next with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:41.575 --> 03:57:44.337]  Don't go away.
[03:57:44.337 --> 03:57:48.841]  I am extremely honoured to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[03:57:50.383 --> 03:57:53.500]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[03:57:54.599 --> 03:57:59.502]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[03:57:59.502 --> 03:58:03.884]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[03:58:03.884 --> 03:58:09.588]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[03:58:09.588 --> 03:58:14.190]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[03:58:14.190 --> 03:58:20.334]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[03:58:20.814 --> 03:58:32.778]  And that's why when you go to Infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.

[03:59:05.330 --> 03:59:09.794]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[03:59:09.794 --> 03:59:11.055]  And I need your support.
