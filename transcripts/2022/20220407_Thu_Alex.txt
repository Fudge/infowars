[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:09.111]  When we saw Obama visit the White House yesterday, we see a classic illustration of this.
[00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:14.452]  If a picture is worth a thousand words, this video, this short 13-second clip, is worth a million words.
[00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:20.673]  You see the dignitaries and White House officials and government officials not wanting to even talk to Biden.
[00:00:20.713 --> 00:00:22.013]  Biden doesn't even know where he is.
[00:00:22.494 --> 00:00:23.834]  He's bumbling around the stage.
[00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:32.436]  And there is Obama, the real president, that everyone wants to be near because he actually runs things.
[00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:35.499]  This is so pathetic, but this is what the globalists have done.
[00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:44.808]  They want to blame their puppet, or puppets, Kamala Harris is just as bad, with all the gas prices and the collapsing border and everything that's happening and the terrible Afghanistan withdrawal.
[00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:51.761]  So that he gets the blame and not Obama, not the Democratic Party, not the globalist organizations.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:59.040]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:18.040]   The whole idea that humans have, you know, this, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.040]   and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.040]   or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:32.207]  We have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale.
[00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:39.973]  New surveillance technologies that are now deployed just to deal with this coronavirus outbreak.
[00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:47.539]  When it's over, some governments may say, yes, but there is a second wave of corona coming, so we have to be prepared.
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.322]  And there is Ebola, and there is also regular flu.
[00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:54.385]  Why not protect people against that too with this new surveillance system?
[00:01:58.541 --> 00:01:58.741]  Absolutely.
[00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:03.366]  Also, it's the moment when surveillance goes really under the skin.
[00:02:04.087 --> 00:02:11.834]  Governments are now not just interested in where we go and who we meet, but even in what's happening inside our bodies.
[00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:15.004]  It's Thursday, April 7th, the year 2022.
[00:02:15.124 --> 00:02:19.688]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm taping this in the morning.
[00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.351]  Hopefully, if our flight isn't delayed, there isn't any issues.
[00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:28.215]  I should be back in Austin around noon today for the second and third hour.
[00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:39.392]  Marjorie Taylor Greene reached out last night and obviously has had Jimmy Kimmel threatening her and saying people should physically attack her and calling her a Klan mother.
[00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:42.054]  Serious dangerous defamation.
[00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:53.482]   So whether I'm back in time or not, the guest host, I'm not sure who the guest host is as of this morning, will be interviewing MTG on that very important issue.
[00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:58.362]   It shows how the left is just turning up the heat when it comes to violence.
[00:02:58.362 --> 00:03:04.321]   We saw Saturday Night Live deliberately talk about gang raping Roger Stone's wife, who
[00:03:04.321 --> 00:03:09.962]   was battling cancer and just, thank God, got over it a few months ago.
[00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:15.722]   This is the ongoing scientific manipulation of the public to be violent towards those
[00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:19.922]   of us that are loyal, good, decent, Christian, God-fearing Americans.
[00:03:19.946 --> 00:03:22.989]  So look for MTG on the show regardless.
[00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.455]  And again, if my flight's not delayed, there's some storms, if there's not any problems, I should be there for the balance of the show.
[00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:39.564]  And then I promise I'm gonna be doing some extra shows on the weekend on Saturday and weeknights last week, because as such historic times are happening, world government is being announced.
[00:03:39.624 --> 00:03:43.904]   Out in the open, everything we've talked about is basically coming true, unfortunately.
[00:03:43.904 --> 00:03:47.104]  But the good news is we know how to stop them together.
[00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:52.024]   And it's been your caring about freedom, your caring about information, your caring about
[00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:58.704]   the real world that has gotten humanity in the position to even be able to fight back.
[00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.024]  And I want that to sink in, okay?
[00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:05.104]   I don't tell you this to just to pat you on the back or to butter you up.
[00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:10.744]   Do you understand that the listeners of InfoWars are recognized by the globalists, by the enemies
[00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:15.784]  of humanity to be the most hardcore cohort of...
[00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:25.383]  Of awake, informed, good people that are going to resist the horrible nightmare, transhumanist, human-animal cloning nightmare that they're building.
[00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:39.193]  This system of dehumanization makes fictional movies like The Matrix and books and films like Brave New World and THX 1138 look like utopias.
[00:04:40.094 --> 00:04:47.604]  This is the dystopia of dystopias because it's a real scientific satanic run dictatorship.
[00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:55.735]  So again, I am paying a big price for fighting them, but it's well worth it because the price of submission is a trillion times worse.
[00:04:56.235 --> 00:04:58.276]  It is infinity worse.
[00:04:58.276 --> 00:05:03.034]   And I'm so sad for people that have decided to join the system and work with it as it's
[00:05:03.034 --> 00:05:05.396]  here to basically call and destroy humanity.
[00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:10.235]   All the horrors, keeping babies alive and still on their organs, all the dehumanization
[00:05:10.235 --> 00:05:11.875]  is now going to come out.
[00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:14.074]  Everything hidden is going to be brought to light.
[00:05:14.074 --> 00:05:19.036]   And none of us are perfect either, but we are not consciously trying to serve evil and
[00:05:19.036 --> 00:05:25.594]   consciously working for a system that's anti-God, anti-human, anti-family, anti-woman, anti-man,
[00:05:25.594 --> 00:05:26.594]  that child.
[00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.091]  So, this is a very important Thursday edition.
[00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:32.474]  Hopefully, and I'll be back in studio very, very soon.
[00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:36.559]  Maybe in 15-20 minutes from now, my flight is on time.
[00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:38.821]  But regardless, it's a big broadcast.
[00:05:38.841 --> 00:05:44.186]  Please remember, InfoWars.com only gets out past the censors when you share it.
[00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:46.428]  Same thing with Band.Video.
[00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:49.592]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:49.872 --> 00:05:51.073]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:05:51.133 --> 00:06:10.852]  Now let's intensify our efforts to free humanity.
[00:06:11.076 --> 00:06:11.957]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:13.057]  today.
[00:06:13.057 --> 00:06:17.235]  Fair to the state of Utah, but it's not just Spencer Cox.
[00:06:17.235 --> 00:06:22.576]   Utah's junior senator Mitt Romney has also decided he's tired of representing the people of
[00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:27.086]   Utah. So instead he's speaking for his neighbors in the state of California where he lives
[00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:31.227]   a lot of the time. Less than a year ago, this is an amazing example, it was just June of
[00:06:31.227 --> 00:06:35.637]   2021, Mitt Romney voted against the nomination of Kentucky Brown Jackson to the DC Supreme
[00:06:35.637 --> 00:06:36.137]  Court.
[00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:37.103]  Circuit Court of Appeals.
[00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.164]  Okay, he thought she wasn't qualified.
[00:06:39.624 --> 00:06:45.846]  Now this week, Mitt Romney announced that he is supporting the same person's confirmation to the Supreme Court.
[00:06:46.666 --> 00:06:47.006]  Huh?
[00:06:48.147 --> 00:06:51.668]  She was unqualified for a lower court, but a perfect choice for the Supreme Court?
[00:06:51.688 --> 00:06:52.368]  How does that work?
[00:06:53.268 --> 00:06:54.429]  Here's Mitt Romney to explain.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:10.254]  In the prior confirmation, I was concerned that she was outside the mainstream, and as a result of our meeting for an hour together and reviewing her testimony before Congress, I became convinced that she's within the mainstream.
[00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:15.339]  She's also a highly qualified, intelligent, capable person, and I wish her the very best.
[00:07:17.842 --> 00:07:17.942]  Oh!
[00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:19.983]  So she's now in the mainstream!
[00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:23.305]  She wasn't less than a year ago, but now she's fully in the mainstream.
[00:07:23.765 --> 00:07:27.927]  So, here's what it took for Mitt Romney to finally support Kentonji Brown-Jackson.
[00:07:28.607 --> 00:07:34.790]  He learned, in the course of Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that she gave lenient sentences to child pornographers.
[00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.352]  Mitt Romney apparently didn't know that last year, hence the vote against her.
[00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:48.524]   Now that he knows that Kentonji Brown-Jackson has discharted sentencing guidelines to benefit child pornographers, It's a yes from Mitt Romney.
[00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:52.027]  That's the junior senator from the state of Utah.
[00:07:52.648 --> 00:07:55.550]  And as with Spencer Cox, this is not a one-time aberration.
[00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:59.431]   Reporter Greg Price summarized Mitt Romney's past few weeks this way quote
[00:07:59.431 --> 00:08:07.230]   Confirmed Kentucky Brown Jackson voted against repealing TSA mask mandate didn't show up to vote defunding Biden vaccine
[00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.511]   mandate Accuses Tulsi Gabbard of treason for opposing the war in
[00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:15.491]   Ukraine Amazing
[00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:17.826]  So, Tulsi Gabbard has betrayed her country.
[00:08:17.906 --> 00:08:18.827]  In uniform, by the way.
[00:08:18.847 --> 00:08:19.868]  She's still serving in the U.S.
[00:08:19.948 --> 00:08:20.229]  Army.
[00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.711]  But BLM?
[00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:25.936]  BLM, which torched American cities for nearly a year?
[00:08:27.077 --> 00:08:27.898]  They're not treasonous.
[00:08:28.018 --> 00:08:28.939]  Not according to Mitt Romney.
[00:08:29.898 --> 00:08:37.966]  Mitt Romney, of course, did take to the streets there, and the first Republican that had joined thousands of people that were protesting George Floyd's death.
[00:08:37.986 --> 00:08:43.891]  The Utah Senator marched with a group of evangelical Christians and shared the photo of himself on Twitter.
[00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:53.621]  And Romney told a reporter that he was participating in those protests because he wanted to make sure that people understood that black lives matter.
[00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:57.416]  We need a voice against racism.
[00:08:57.436 --> 00:09:00.341]  We need many voices against racism and against brutality.
[00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.305]  We need to stand up and say that black lives matter.
[00:09:04.406 --> 00:09:05.187]  Oh yeah.
[00:09:05.788 --> 00:09:07.391]  Mitt Romney took to the streets!
[00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:14.531]  That was the greatest line ever uttered on cable news, and like all the great lines, nobody laughed.
[00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:22.734]  Mitt Romney took to the streets to watch BLM burn down cities, shoot people, and defraud donors to buy $6 million mansions in L.A.
[00:09:23.314 --> 00:09:24.555]  Ooh, but guess who the traitor is?
[00:09:25.295 --> 00:09:26.175]  It's Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:27.856]  That's who Mitt Romney's telling us.
[00:09:28.476 --> 00:09:33.858]  And Tulsi Gabbard is a lot worse than Tony Fauci, who funded the production of a virus in China that killed millions of people.
[00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:34.559]  Is that treasonous?
[00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:35.259]  No!
[00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:37.260]  That's not treasonous, that's not according to Mitt Romney.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:37.840]  Watch.
[00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:49.040]  I do want to point out how much I personally, and I believe the great majority of the people in our country, respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do.
[00:09:49.721 --> 00:09:52.023]  You are scientists, not politicians.
[00:09:53.224 --> 00:10:15.019]   Nevertheless, you are being made subject to the political whims of various political individuals, and that comes at a high cost, which unfortunately, I fear, will lead some to not want to participate That's what Mitt Romney learned.
[00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.420]  Back from the streets!
[00:10:18.221 --> 00:10:20.042]  So the concern here, of course, is democracy.
[00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:23.624]  And that's a word on the lips of every concerned person on television.
[00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:25.045]  What about our democracy?
[00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:27.027]  Every day you hear that.
[00:10:27.087 --> 00:10:28.467]  So just a quick civics recap.
[00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:33.528]  Democracy is a form of government in which elected representatives represent the people who elect them.
[00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:34.809]  They do what they ask.
[00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:35.949]  The people rule.
[00:10:36.789 --> 00:10:42.810]  So with that in mind, and given our strong commitments to democracy, you have to wonder where Mitt Romney's coming from.
[00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:44.990]  Is he participating in a system called democracy?
[00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:50.991]  Because the majority of Republicans, people who put him in office, would like Tony Fauci to leave his job immediately.
[00:10:51.712 --> 00:10:52.892]  But not Mitt Romney.
[00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:53.872]  He doesn't care at all.
[00:10:55.273 --> 00:10:57.955]  Mitt Romney is not alone, of course, neither is Spencer Cox.
[00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:03.639]  It turns out a lot of Republicans in red states serially betray their voters.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.081]  Give them the finger day after day after day.
[00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:09.144]  The question is, how long were Republican voters put up with this?
[00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:12.506]  Pedro Gonzalez is one of the smartest journalists in this country.
[00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:13.167]  He joins us now.
[00:11:17.446 --> 00:11:20.891]  Meet your new Supreme Court Judge, Ketanji Jackson.
[00:11:21.892 --> 00:11:33.068]  In every single case involving child pornography, Judge Ketanji Jackson has been lenient and openly sympathetic with the perpetrators of child rape pornography.
[00:11:33.849 --> 00:11:38.731]  Christopher Michael Downs openly bragged about molesting his 13-year-old cousin.
[00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:44.974]  He was arrested for trading videos of child rape, including children as young as two years old.
[00:11:45.554 --> 00:11:48.916]  Judge Jackson gave him the absolute bare minimum sentence.
[00:11:50.109 --> 00:12:05.477]  Ryan Manning Cooper was arrested for having more than 600 images involving the rape and torture of children, including infants and toddlers, which is why the prosecutors made it clear that the case was on the more egregious or extreme spectrum.
[00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:15.282]  But Judge Jackson disagreed and ruled that distributing images of infants and toddlers being raped is not especially egregious.
[00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:21.554]  Wesley Keith Hawkins posted videos of 11-year-old boys being raped by men.
[00:12:22.154 --> 00:12:37.222]  Jackson only gave him three months, sent him to a low-security prison, arranged for special protections, and apologized to him, telling him that she feels so sorry for him and his family, and for the anguish that this has caused all of them.
[00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:43.826]  In explaining her light sentence, Judge Jackson argued for the child pornographer's future potential.
[00:12:44.606 --> 00:12:54.731]  Six years later, he was arrested again for distributing child rape porn, and Jackson re-sentenced him to only six months in a residential re-entry center.
[00:12:55.812 --> 00:13:06.457]  Neil Alexander Stewart was arrested with hundreds of images and videos of child rape while trying to procure children between the ages of 5 and 11 to rape them.
[00:13:07.197 --> 00:13:19.811]  Judge Jackson admitted that the felon was likely to re-offend, but still gave a light sentence, arguing that the current recommendations for child sex offenders is outdated and substantially flawed.
[00:13:20.933 --> 00:13:23.435]  Three years later, Stewart re-offended.
[00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:27.674]  This is how Judge Jackson got her start.
[00:13:28.334 --> 00:13:32.438]  In 2009, President Obama nominated her to vice chair the U.S.
[00:13:32.498 --> 00:13:42.668]  Sentencing Commission, where she helped weaken federal sentencing policy for child pornographers by arguing that child pornographers are not pedophiles.
[00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:54.162]  Which is similar to how Hillary Clinton got her start when she defended a group of men who violently gang raped a child and later joked how she knew they were guilty.
[00:13:55.509 --> 00:14:02.877]  It's also very interesting that when the biggest pedophile scandal in history broke, Judge Jackson was there.
[00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:16.170]  After WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails, millions of people were asking questions about a strange coded language being used between President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and their friends.
[00:14:17.231 --> 00:14:22.596]  A code that seemed to reflect what the FBI says is secret code for pedophiles.
[00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:26.520]  The whole sordid mess became known as Pizzagate.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:34.367]  And when the Fed's cleanup operation ended up in the courts, Judge Kitanji Jackson was there to help tidy it all up.
[00:14:35.683 --> 00:14:38.564]  I'm sure this is all just a coincidence.
[00:14:39.484 --> 00:14:48.846]  Just like it was a coincidence that the world's most infamous pedophile blackmail artist killed himself in jail while the guards were surfing the internet.
[00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:57.689]  And just like it's a coincidence that Congress has paid out millions of dollars in court settlements that involve sexual assault.
[00:14:58.769 --> 00:15:06.451]  In some parallel universe, there may be an Earth that protects its children from pedophiles and other child predators.
[00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:08.072]  But not this one.
[00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:13.253]  On this Earth, we pay them taxes and sacrifice our children to them.
[00:15:14.732 --> 00:15:17.532]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:15:17.532 --> 00:15:38.732]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in my presence.
[00:15:38.732 --> 00:15:41.532]  It's Alice Jones.
[00:15:42.332 --> 00:15:44.332]  [Screaming]
[00:15:45.132 --> 00:15:49.131]  [Beeping]
[00:15:49.932 --> 00:15:54.932]  [Music]
[00:15:55.732 --> 00:16:20.732]  [Music]
[00:16:21.701 --> 00:16:31.540]   Long before the puppet Biden was able to steal the 2020 election, courtesy of the deep state,
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.540]   we warned you that we're planning to steal the election and that he would serve as the
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:44.980]   perfect placeholder for the third administration of Barack Hussein Obama, who was not a puppet,
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:52.060]   but a high-level globalist operative meeting at the highest levels of the World Council
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.341]   of Governors, which is known as the Davos Group/Bilderberg Group.
[00:16:56.341 --> 00:17:01.860]   Bilderberg Group is the secret arm, the outer extension is the World Economic Forum.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.020]  And they're now bragging about that and admitting that.
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:15.192]   So when we saw Obama visit the White House yesterday, We see a classic illustration of this.
[00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:20.556]  If a picture is worth a thousand words, this video, this short 13 second clip is worth a million words.
[00:17:21.116 --> 00:17:26.780]  You see the dignitaries and White House officials and government officials not wanting to even talk to Biden.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:28.121]  Biden doesn't even know where he is.
[00:17:28.602 --> 00:17:29.943]  He's bumbling around the stage.
[00:17:31.258 --> 00:17:38.526]  And there is Obama, the real president, that everyone wants to be near because he actually runs things.
[00:17:39.087 --> 00:17:41.589]  This is so pathetic, but this is what the globalists have done.
[00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:50.900]  They want to blame their puppet, or puppets, Kamala Harris is just as bad, with all the gas prices and the collapsing border and everything that's happening and the terrible Afghanistan withdrawal.
[00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:57.854]  So that he gets the blame and not Obama, not the Democratic Party, and not the globalist organizations.
[00:17:58.595 --> 00:18:02.816]  Now here's another clip of Biden joking about starting World War III.
[00:18:03.196 --> 00:18:08.037]  And we'll hand the baton for the big kickoff of the transmission of Harrison Smith.
[00:18:08.617 --> 00:18:13.238]  And I, ladies and gentlemen, am in the air as we speak to be back in Austin very, very soon.
[00:18:13.278 --> 00:18:13.658]  Stay with us.
[00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:16.079]  This fight is far from over.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.061]  Here's the point.
[00:18:19.742 --> 00:18:25.991]  This war could continue for a long time, but the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the fight for freedom.
[00:18:26.632 --> 00:18:27.854]  And I just want you to know that.
[00:18:28.014 --> 00:18:31.479]  And by the way, if I gotta go to war, I'm going with you guys.
[00:18:33.206 --> 00:18:36.068]  In other words, if I send us to war, it's you guys that are going to go.
[00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:36.828]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:18:36.868 --> 00:18:37.829]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:37.969 --> 00:18:42.691]  I'm Harrison Smith, host of the American Journal, broadcast every weekday, 8 to 11 a.m.
[00:18:42.731 --> 00:18:44.653]  here on Infowars.com and Bandod Video.
[00:18:45.173 --> 00:18:47.054]  I'm just sitting in momentarily for Alex.
[00:18:47.074 --> 00:18:48.555]  He is on the way.
[00:18:48.635 --> 00:18:51.056]  He should be joining us within an hour or so.
[00:18:52.717 --> 00:19:09.889]  Now, we're supposed to talk to Marjorie Taylor Greene, but unfortunately Nancy Pelosi is up to her old tricks and has called for a vote on the House floor that Marjorie Taylor Greene, of course, completely preempts anything we want to do since she's needed there on the floor to cast her vote.
[00:19:10.829 --> 00:19:14.335]  We believe, yes, suspending normal trade relations with Russia.
[00:19:14.375 --> 00:19:15.677]  So that vote is going on now.
[00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:26.072]  So we're going to try to connect with Marjorie Taylor Greene, but she may be doing more important things like, well, trying to keep us out of the war in Ukraine, unlike most of the people in power.
[00:19:27.358 --> 00:19:27.999]  Other than her.
[00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:30.061]  In fact, here's the story at Infowars.com.
[00:19:30.121 --> 00:19:45.076]  Pentagon says Russia-Ukraine war likely to last for years, if you can understand them, through the drooling, through the salivating, as they are desperate for yet another endless war to enrich themselves and further their globalist schemes.
[00:19:45.356 --> 00:19:51.462]   The Pentagon believes that the Russia-Ukraine war will turn out to be a very protracted conflict that's likely to go on For years.
[00:19:51.522 --> 00:20:00.485]  That prediction was made during a House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, which was attended by General Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
[00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:05.607]  He says, quote, I do think this is a very protracted conflict, and I think it's at least measured in years.
[00:20:05.747 --> 00:20:09.048]  I don't know about decades, but at least years, for sure.
[00:20:09.228 --> 00:20:10.348]  But hey, maybe decades.
[00:20:10.608 --> 00:20:11.769]  Maybe, maybe decades.
[00:20:11.829 --> 00:20:13.029]  Maybe we can look forward to that.
[00:20:13.729 --> 00:20:27.020]   Of course, when you look at the other conflicts we've gotten into that share an awful lot of you know similarities with this conflict such as Afghanistan where we armed the Mujahideen that became the Taliban in order to
[00:20:28.039 --> 00:20:33.779]   you know, prohibit USSR aggression in that country, only to later go to war with people wielding our own
[00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:34.240]  weapons.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.940]   You can just wait until we are at war with the Ukrainian Nazis against our own weapons,
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.039]  or maybe this will just drag on for decades regardless.
[00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:48.539]   It appears as though the people in power in our country, from the President of the United States to the Joint Chiefs
[00:20:48.539 --> 00:20:53.299]   of Staff, to NATO itself, are desperate for this conflict to get
[00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:53.639]  worse.
[00:20:53.639 --> 00:20:55.039]  They're not doing anything to make it better.
[00:20:55.039 --> 00:21:01.039]   I haven't heard a single person suggest peace at all, even once, even a little bit.
[00:21:01.143 --> 00:21:10.390]  It's like they it's like it doesn't even enter into their mind that maybe expanding and exaggerating and Getting further into war might not be the best option.
[00:21:10.491 --> 00:21:11.852]  It's like they don't even consider it.
[00:21:12.032 --> 00:21:15.670]   They couldn't care less But there's still a lot to cover.
[00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.230]   And a lot of the lies about what's going on in Ukraine are coming to light.
[00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.230]  Again, two stories at Infowars.com.
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.490]  They sort of go hand in hand.
[00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.490]  You have this.
[00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:29.711]  Twitter bans ex-UN weapons inspector over Ukraine.
[00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.109]  Twitter banned the retired U.S.
[00:21:31.217 --> 00:21:41.963]  Marine Corps officer Scott Ritter on Wednesday, accusing him of engaging in prohibitive behavior by questioning the claims of Ukrainian authorities that Russian soldiers had massacred civilians in Bukha, near Kiev.
[00:21:42.283 --> 00:21:44.165]  Ritter's best known as the former U.N.
[00:21:44.225 --> 00:21:45.866]  weapons inspector who doubted U.S.
[00:21:45.906 --> 00:21:52.449]  claims about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction invoked by Washington as a pretext for the 2003 invasion.
[00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:54.511]  So he was right about that.
[00:21:55.131 --> 00:22:01.837]  If only we'd listened to him back then, and now he's sounding similar alarms, and he's been kicked off of Twitter.
[00:22:01.877 --> 00:22:02.597]  Of course he has.
[00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:05.159]  Because you can't spread misinformation on Twitter.
[00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:06.040]  That's not allowed.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.682]  It's explicitly prohibited, in fact.
[00:22:09.223 --> 00:22:21.794]   Unless, of course, it's disinformation that progresses the agenda of the globalists, as the viral video of the Russian, er, viral photo of the Russian mobile crematorium Has gone absolutely insane.
[00:22:22.275 --> 00:22:24.838]  It's a tweet from an 8-year-old YouTube video.
[00:22:25.439 --> 00:22:34.791]  A viral tweet that remains unchecked by so-called fact-checkers claims to show a Russian-operated mobile crematorium in Mariupol, but the image is taken from an 8-year-old YouTube video.
[00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:41.453]  Whoopsie-daisy, the tweet was posted by news outlet NEXTA, which boasts nearly a million followers on Twitter.
[00:22:41.773 --> 00:22:45.095]  The tweet has received over 7,000 retweets and almost 11,000 likes.
[00:22:45.755 --> 00:22:52.337]  According to him, tens of thousands of people could have died in Mariupol, and the cremation covered up traces of their crime.
[00:22:52.877 --> 00:22:58.019]  Except that it doesn't, and it doesn't exist, and they didn't, and it's all fabricated.
[00:22:58.099 --> 00:23:00.120]  So, interesting developments there.
[00:23:01.206 --> 00:23:34.860]   And when we get back on the other side, I'll show you a video of NBC actually just basically coming out and admitting the fact that they're not fact-checking, even in the slightest, the claims made by the intelligence agencies and the intelligence agencies themselves are admitting that what they're operating off of is not hard evidence, but more of speculation and more of, well, this is what we want people to think in order to progress our agenda, which, by the way, Has nothing even slightly in common with anything that benefits the American people or serves our interests even a little bit.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.102]  Again, they're not even trying to make the argument in this case.
[00:23:37.142 --> 00:23:41.966]  At least with Iraq, they could claim that if he makes a weapon of mass destruction, he'll deploy it here.
[00:23:42.386 --> 00:23:44.288]  In Ukraine, they're just like, shut up and go to war.
[00:23:44.908 --> 00:23:52.214]  Shut up and go to war and swallow down these lies that we'll use to predicate our actions.
[00:23:53.097 --> 00:23:53.817]  It's just absurd.
[00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:59.038]  But of course we've been fighting this, and we as in Infowars, I was in middle school at the time.
[00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:07.460]  But ever since the Iraq War, Alex Jones has been staunchly anti-war and has been demonized continuously for pointing out the lies that get us into war.
[00:24:07.721 --> 00:24:10.841]  As Julian Assange says, the people of the West don't like war.
[00:24:10.921 --> 00:24:11.801]  We don't want war.
[00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:13.702]  We have to be lied into it.
[00:24:14.002 --> 00:24:15.902]  And that is the crux of the information war.
[00:24:15.942 --> 00:24:25.424]  You can force people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do, up to and including war and death and destruction, if you just give them information that leads them down the wrong path.
[00:24:25.724 --> 00:24:26.784]  It really is as simple as that.
[00:24:26.824 --> 00:24:29.085]  So the info war continues on the other side.
[00:24:29.185 --> 00:24:30.145]  Alex Jones is on the way.
[00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:31.345]  I'll be here for the next few minutes.
[00:24:33.065 --> 00:24:34.305]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:34.345 --> 00:24:35.926]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:39.186]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex for this first hour.
[00:24:39.286 --> 00:24:41.607]  He is on his way and will be here shortly.
[00:24:44.096 --> 00:24:51.580]  Unfortunately, we are not able to have Marjorie Taylor Greene on right now because she has been called away to deal with an urgent vote on the House floor.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.801]  It's going on now.
[00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:54.482]  You can see if you're a television viewer.
[00:24:54.862 --> 00:24:58.505]  Suspending normal trade relations with Russia is the topic.
[00:24:58.525 --> 00:25:04.328]  It needs a two-thirds majority to pass, and the votes are now being cast and counted.
[00:25:04.768 --> 00:25:06.209]  We'll keep you up to date on that.
[00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.113]  But we'll talk a little bit more about this war and how exactly we are waging it.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:19.823]  By we, I mean the American states, and by waging war, I mean just waging an endless disinformation campaign.
[00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:27.666]  It's really kind of wild how many stories out of Ukraine are just provably false immediately, as soon as they come out.
[00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:30.328]  It's not to say that Russia isn't invading.
[00:25:30.348 --> 00:25:32.108]  Like, this is the way the leftists will take it, right?
[00:25:32.148 --> 00:25:40.092]  We'll be like, well, the ghost of Kiev wasn't real, and the Snake Island thing wasn't real, and there's a lot of suspicious activity here, and this doesn't look like it happened.
[00:25:40.112 --> 00:25:42.878]   They'll be like, Oh, so you're saying Russia never invaded Ukraine?
[00:25:43.019 --> 00:25:45.064]  It's like... What are you talking about?
[00:25:45.084 --> 00:25:47.090]  I mean, this is the way they take things, so...
[00:25:49.386 --> 00:25:51.146]  It's not our fault that you're a bunch of liars.
[00:25:51.286 --> 00:25:59.148]  It's not our fault that you are the boy who cried wolf and now you're just slaughtering sheep in an attempt to convince us that the wolf is real.
[00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:00.188]  We don't believe you.
[00:26:00.688 --> 00:26:01.469]  It's not real.
[00:26:01.649 --> 00:26:12.831]  You're a bunch of liars and psychopaths and warmongers who are attempting to lead us into yet another decade-long conflict with absolutely no benefit for the American people you're not even pretending that there is.
[00:26:14.158 --> 00:26:17.641]  And they're actually acknowledging this tactic now.
[00:26:17.821 --> 00:26:20.904]  They're using this tactic on purpose and being pretty open about it.
[00:26:20.924 --> 00:26:22.946]  In fact, I want to go now to this video.
[00:26:22.966 --> 00:26:29.372]  This is NBC talking about the way that America is waging a disinformation campaign.
[00:26:29.452 --> 00:26:30.754]  It's an information war.
[00:26:31.194 --> 00:26:32.055]  It's propaganda.
[00:26:32.155 --> 00:26:32.775]  It's baseless.
[00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:33.476]  It's a lie.
[00:26:33.776 --> 00:26:34.577]  But it's good for you.
[00:26:34.757 --> 00:26:35.198]  Let's watch.
[00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:36.711]  The U.S.
[00:26:36.771 --> 00:26:42.113]  using intelligence to fight an information war and doing it to Russia for months now and it's working.
[00:26:42.553 --> 00:26:45.974]  NBC News National Security Correspondent Ken Delaney and live in Washington.
[00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:51.135]  Ken, I want to start by giving people an example of what this is so they know what we're talking about.
[00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:51.595]  Take a look.
[00:26:54.356 --> 00:27:00.138]  They're also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine.
[00:27:00.758 --> 00:27:03.719]  That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those.
[00:27:05.438 --> 00:27:11.227]  Can you explain to our viewers what was going on there and what NBC News has learned about that claim this week from three different U.S.
[00:27:11.287 --> 00:27:11.627]  officials?
[00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:14.774]  Yeah, that was a great example of what we're talking about.
[00:27:14.794 --> 00:27:23.337]  That was based on declassified intelligence, but we're also told the intelligence wasn't very clear about what exactly was going on.
[00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:32.120]  And they decided to disclose it as a way of deterring Russia from doing that and putting the world on notice that this could happen.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.021]  And that's really, that's what's going on here, the big picture.
[00:27:35.301 --> 00:27:38.262]  This is an unprecedented use of declassified intelligence.
[00:27:38.302 --> 00:27:42.624]   We've never seen this level of information warfare before from the US government.
[00:27:43.264 --> 00:27:57.528]  And what they're doing is they're trying to preempt the Russians, get ahead of Russian disinformation, even mess with Vladimir Putin's brain as one person put it, leave him off balance to try to show that the United States knows what Russia is up to and is going to get ahead of it.
[00:27:58.288 --> 00:28:00.348]  It's really rather remarkable.
[00:28:00.468 --> 00:28:06.587]   Another example was when they announced that Russia had gone to China to ask for help with
[00:28:06.587 --> 00:28:08.508]  what would, getting some weapons.
[00:28:08.508 --> 00:28:12.067]   That hasn't come to pass yet and it was almost a way of putting China on notice, hey, we
[00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:14.468]  know what's going on here, don't let this happen.
[00:28:14.468 --> 00:28:18.027]   So really interesting and unprecedented use of intelligence here, Allison.
[00:28:18.027 --> 00:28:21.788]   Yeah, and Ken, as you just said, not just intelligence here, unprecedented use.
[00:28:21.788 --> 00:28:25.948]   One US official telling you, it doesn't even have to be solid intelligence when we talk
[00:28:25.948 --> 00:28:26.948]  about it.
[00:28:26.948 --> 00:28:28.908]  It's more important to get out ahead of them.
[00:28:28.908 --> 00:28:33.547]  Putin specifically, before they do something, it's preventative.
[00:28:33.547 --> 00:28:37.147]  What else have you learned about that strategy?
[00:28:37.147 --> 00:28:39.507]  I'll tell you, I've learned all about this new strategy.
[00:28:39.514 --> 00:28:41.054]  It's so interesting, isn't it?
[00:28:41.114 --> 00:28:43.175]  It's interesting and unprecedented.
[00:28:43.875 --> 00:28:47.257]  Is it, though, with the American government lying us into war?
[00:28:47.457 --> 00:28:50.538]  I don't think this is as new of a thing as they claim.
[00:28:50.778 --> 00:28:55.500]  I think what's new about it is the fact that they're so open about this tactic that they're using.
[00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:56.860]  Here's the story from NBC.
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.741]  In a break with the past, U.S.
[00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:04.183]  is using Intel to fight an info war with Russia, even when the Intel isn't rock solid.
[00:29:04.343 --> 00:29:05.525]  Even when it's completely made up.
[00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:07.608]  Even when it's entirely false.
[00:29:08.088 --> 00:29:09.290]  They're using it.
[00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:10.732]  No matter what.
[00:29:10.852 --> 00:29:11.533]  Isn't that great?
[00:29:11.593 --> 00:29:12.755]  Isn't that wonderful and amazing?
[00:29:13.817 --> 00:29:14.277]  Three U.S.
[00:29:14.297 --> 00:29:19.000]  officials told NBC News this week there's no evidence Russia's brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.741]  They say the U.S.
[00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:23.623]  released the information to deter Russia from using the banned munitions.
[00:29:23.743 --> 00:29:25.424]  Again, we've explained it so many times here.
[00:29:26.725 --> 00:29:29.287]  The New World Order really operates with two arms.
[00:29:29.327 --> 00:29:37.071]  The one arm, through the government or even corporations, that's there to abuse and confuse and befuddle and abuse you.
[00:29:38.032 --> 00:29:49.501]  And then the left arm is the media to tell you why that's such a good thing and why it's wonderful and why you should continue to trust them even as they're telling you that what they've told you before turned out to be entirely false made-up lies.
[00:29:50.402 --> 00:29:57.147]  So one of a string of examples, this article continues, of the Biden administration breaking with recent president by deploying classified intelligence.
[00:29:58.908 --> 00:30:02.030]  Which, when they say declassified intelligence, just read made-up nonsense.
[00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:10.914]  As part of an information war against Russia, the administration has done so even when the intelligence wasn't rock-solid, officials said, to keep President Vladimir Putin off balance.
[00:30:11.335 --> 00:30:12.595]  Yeah, we're gonna keep him off balance.
[00:30:12.615 --> 00:30:13.356]  See, it's a good thing.
[00:30:14.236 --> 00:30:15.277]  We're messing with his head.
[00:30:15.417 --> 00:30:16.198]  It must mess with Putin.
[00:30:16.238 --> 00:30:17.338]  I mean, it's got to work, right?
[00:30:17.839 --> 00:30:19.980]  Putin's got to sit there going, they're just making stuff up.
[00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:22.302]  They're making stuff up and everybody's believing them.
[00:30:22.842 --> 00:30:25.044]  They're making, they have a free press there, don't they?
[00:30:25.264 --> 00:30:27.646]  Why aren't they calling out their own government on these lies?
[00:30:27.786 --> 00:30:30.608]  It must be incredibly confusing to Vladimir Putin.
[00:30:30.928 --> 00:30:39.530]  To hear baseless lies be spouted by the United States government and then picked up uncritically by the United States media, it must be highly confusing.
[00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:41.370]  And remember, they got called out for this.
[00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:50.532]  I think it was Jake Sullivan that was being questioned, and I believe it was about the chemical weapons attacks in Ukraine that were imminent, that were coming up.
[00:30:51.172 --> 00:30:57.214]  And there was a reporter from NPR or something, it was a video not too long ago, I wish I'd grab it for this show.
[00:30:58.354 --> 00:31:02.936]  But I'm sure you remember, because we played it on InfoWars quite a bit, was that the guy was going, yeah, but what is this?
[00:31:03.036 --> 00:31:04.517]  What is the source of this information?
[00:31:04.817 --> 00:31:06.057]  Why do you know this to be true?
[00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.318]  And Jake Sullivan gets really mad.
[00:31:07.358 --> 00:31:08.438]  He's like, I just told it to you.
[00:31:08.899 --> 00:31:10.239]  I just told you that it's true.
[00:31:10.299 --> 00:31:10.900]  So it's true.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.860]  I am the source.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.461]  Well, the fact is, there was no source.
[00:31:13.521 --> 00:31:35.634]   The fact is, he got that mad and he snapped back like that because he was being called out on a lie, because what they were presenting to the American people from the official spokesperson of the You know, entire military behind the official podium was a lie, was a baseless falsehood that they were perpetuating with no evidence to back it up.
[00:31:35.654 --> 00:31:39.057]  So when the press demanded evidence, they got very snippish.
[00:31:39.137 --> 00:31:43.881]  They got very mad and angry that anybody would dare to question their dictates.
[00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:47.464]  Well, you were questioning it because you're known liars and you're doing it again.
[00:31:48.045 --> 00:31:49.086]  And it's not a small thing.
[00:31:49.106 --> 00:31:51.648]  This is the cusp of World War Three.
[00:31:51.988 --> 00:31:54.956]   We are You know, teetering on right now.
[00:31:55.276 --> 00:32:00.961]  Maybe you want to be a little bit more circumspect about the information that you're presenting and the lies that you're telling.
[00:32:01.701 --> 00:32:06.902]   This article continues, "Multiple US officers acknowledged that the US has used information as a weapon even when
[00:32:06.902 --> 00:32:09.701]  confidence in the accuracy of the information wasn't high."
[00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:10.701]  [laughs]
[00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:18.760]   Yeah, it's just like when you have a little kid and their mouth is covered in chocolate ice cream and they're like, "I
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.701]  didn't eat the ice cream."
[00:32:19.662 --> 00:32:24.207]  It's like, well, I don't have confidence that the accuracy of that information is very high.
[00:32:24.307 --> 00:32:26.089]  No, it's bullcrap is what it is.
[00:32:26.169 --> 00:32:27.310]  It's a complete lie.
[00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:29.552]  You are just absolutely full of it.
[00:32:29.592 --> 00:32:35.437]   But I'm sorry, in deep state, Spy speak, it's the accuracy of the information wasn't high.
[00:32:36.017 --> 00:32:40.480]  Sometimes it's used low-confidence intelligence for deterrent effect, as with chemical agents.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.102]  And other times, as a official put it, the US is just trying to get inside Putin's head.
[00:32:44.122 --> 00:32:46.584]  Well, you're getting inside all of our heads.
[00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:48.986]  We're all befuddled and bamboozled.
[00:32:49.246 --> 00:32:49.726]  Well done.
[00:32:49.826 --> 00:32:50.627]  Congratulations.
[00:32:50.947 --> 00:33:00.849]   Abuse us at will, since you have us in this discombobulated and dislocated status. It's really unbelievably ridiculous. But of course,
[00:33:00.849 --> 00:33:02.809]  this is why they hate InfoWars.
[00:33:02.809 --> 00:33:06.971]   This is why they want us off the air. If they controlled all of the passages of information,
[00:33:06.971 --> 00:33:11.050]   they could get away with stuff like this. But we won't let them as long as we have a
[00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:16.490]   platform to speak out against it. Support us in this mission by going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:22.211]   The massive super sale is still on. It's been extended and you're getting 75% off some of
[00:33:22.211 --> 00:33:26.650]   our top selling products. And I can't get over the t-shirt sales. You're getting t-shirts
[00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.329]   that are of the highest quality you can possibly imagine. I mean, I still wear t-shirts I bought
[00:33:31.329 --> 00:33:36.211]   six years ago from the InfoWars Store and they've only gotten softer. They haven't faded.
[00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:40.369]   They haven't gotten holes in them. They are really the highest quality. You will be blown
[00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.632]  Blown away by these t-shirts.
[00:33:42.692 --> 00:33:46.835]  Especially the fact that you're paying, in some cases, less than $10 for these t-shirts.
[00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:49.096]  I mean, that's less than you can get undershirts for.
[00:33:49.657 --> 00:33:51.118]  And yet, these things are beautiful.
[00:33:51.158 --> 00:33:52.739]  They will last forever.
[00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:57.022]  And best of all, they support this program and everything we do here at InfoWars.
[00:33:57.042 --> 00:33:58.242]  We'll be back on the other side for more.
[00:33:58.263 --> 00:33:59.143]  Alright, welcome back.
[00:33:59.263 --> 00:34:01.024]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:05.307]  This is Sarah Smith sitting in for Alex Jones, who is en route to the studio.
[00:34:05.327 --> 00:34:07.589]  And we should be seeing him momentarily here.
[00:34:09.315 --> 00:34:12.980]  Yeah, I missed this line when I was reading it the first time, this article in a break with the past.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:20.190]  US is using Intel to fight an info war with Russia even when the Intel isn't... Even when the Intel isn't rock solid.
[00:34:21.572 --> 00:34:22.914]  Even when we make it up ourselves.
[00:34:22.934 --> 00:34:24.356]  Yeah, we'll go ahead and run with that.
[00:34:27.116 --> 00:34:41.206]  NBC News says of this tactic of using false information to say it's true, to lie the American people into war, they say observers of all stripes have called it a bold and so far successful strategy.
[00:34:41.586 --> 00:34:42.887]  Yet everybody loves it.
[00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:56.944]  They say, quote, it's the most amazing display of intelligence as an instrument of state power that I've seen or that I've heard of since the Cuban Missile Crisis, when they wanted to do Operation Northwoods and kill a bunch of Americans and blame it on Cuba.
[00:34:56.984 --> 00:34:57.645]  Just amazing.
[00:34:57.685 --> 00:34:58.506]  It's amazing.
[00:34:59.107 --> 00:35:00.128]  It's so brave!
[00:35:00.269 --> 00:35:10.822]  It's just like the intelligence agency, like, yes, we are spouting misinformation and disinformation in an attempt to warp the minds of the American people and lead us further into war, and the news media is just like, amazing!
[00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:11.924]  Amazing!
[00:35:11.964 --> 00:35:12.885]  How brave you are!
[00:35:12.945 --> 00:35:13.686]  How powerful!
[00:35:14.107 --> 00:35:14.788]  How incredible!
[00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:25.535]  It's just never been more clear that our media is simply an extension of the State Department and the Deep State in general.
[00:35:26.036 --> 00:35:41.162]  Now some interesting things, interesting series of events, series of headlines I'd like to run through here, again having to do with World War III and the Deep State's desperation to embroil us in even more destructive policies overseas.
[00:35:42.342 --> 00:35:42.582]  U.S.
[00:35:42.622 --> 00:35:47.186]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, likely to trigger China.
[00:35:47.486 --> 00:35:47.707]  U.S.
[00:35:47.827 --> 00:35:55.673]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is scheduled to visit Taiwan, according to media reports, a landmark display of American support that triggered a diplomatic protest from Beijing.
[00:35:56.133 --> 00:35:58.595]  So Pelosi announced she would arrive in Taipei on Sunday.
[00:35:58.635 --> 00:36:04.560]  It'd be the first visit to the island since Newt Gingrich went there, at least the first visit by a serving U.S.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.603]  House Speaker since Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997.
[00:36:09.997 --> 00:36:11.999]  And then China said, yeah, I don't think so, lady.
[00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:14.342]  You're going to go ahead and have to stay home.
[00:36:14.382 --> 00:36:22.670]  They say, quote, if the United States insists on having its own way, China will take strong measures in response to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
[00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:27.195]  All possible consequences that arise from this will completely be borne by the U.S.
[00:36:27.215 --> 00:36:32.715]   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, Reuters reported.
[00:36:32.715 --> 00:36:38.215]   And then Pelosi got COVID. God darn it. Darn it. She was gonna go to Taiwan.
[00:36:38.215 --> 00:36:42.775]   She was gonna stand up against China. She was gonna flex America's might right off
[00:36:42.775 --> 00:36:49.254]   the shores of our most intractable political opponent. But then she came
[00:36:49.254 --> 00:36:53.934]  down with the sniffles. Darn it. Dang it.
[00:36:51.845 --> 00:36:57.907]  She was totally going to do it too, but now she's not going to, and it's not happening, and she's got COVID.
[00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:04.369]  Even though she's asymptomatic, and even though she's apparently now holding a vote on the House floor, she, darn it, she's just too sick.
[00:37:04.509 --> 00:37:04.869]  Shoot!
[00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:05.989]  Dang it!
[00:37:06.649 --> 00:37:07.350]  Well, oh well.
[00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:10.290]  Do you regret now, Globalist?
[00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:18.193]  Do you regret purposefully transferring massive amounts of our power to the highly nationalistic Chinese government?
[00:37:18.653 --> 00:37:22.323]   Are you Wondering why you went ahead and did that?
[00:37:22.403 --> 00:37:23.105]  No, of course not.
[00:37:23.246 --> 00:37:25.754]  It's all... It's all by design.
[00:37:27.262 --> 00:37:28.701]  And maybe she'll go anyway.
[00:37:28.701 --> 00:37:32.061]   Maybe she'll just go anyway, because that's what we need now
[00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:37.742]   is Ukraine 2.0 with China as an adversary, instead of Russia.
[00:37:37.742 --> 00:37:39.981]  We'll drive those two countries close together.
[00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:45.141]   We'll solidify and really empower the anti-American coalition across the world.
[00:37:45.141 --> 00:37:51.742]   And once again, just like all of the measures with Russia, the ruble now, like highest it's been in a very long time,
[00:37:51.742 --> 00:37:54.862]  the Russian economy kind of doing fine despite sanctions.
[00:37:54.862 --> 00:37:56.182]  But we're suffering.
[00:37:56.182 --> 00:38:00.182]  We're experiencing total supply line collapses.
[00:38:00.182 --> 00:38:04.782]   So we'll pay the price for the things that are done to other countries by our government.
[00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.461]  And it won't hurt them in the slightest.
[00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:08.461]  It seems to only empower them.
[00:38:08.461 --> 00:38:13.621]   It would be like the people in DC were just incredibly incompetent and just
[00:38:13.621 --> 00:38:16.742]   failed at everything they were trying to do, until you realize
[00:38:16.742 --> 00:38:23.582]   that what their aim is and what their goal is and what their professed ultimate prize is
[00:38:23.582 --> 00:38:28.062]   is the collapse of the United States, in which case it becomes pretty obvious that everything they're doing
[00:38:28.062 --> 00:38:29.382]  is working perfectly.
[00:38:29.382 --> 00:38:33.582]  And they're very good at pulling this stuff off.
[00:38:33.582 --> 00:38:36.621]  And of course, all of this is deeply intertwined, right?
[00:38:36.621 --> 00:38:39.461]  I've got lots of stories here about COVID.
[00:38:39.445 --> 00:38:44.164]   Epoch Times memo reveals State Department assessed in early 2020 that lab leak was most likely,
[00:38:44.164 --> 00:38:49.765]   was the most likely origin of COVID-19. Maybe this was another one of their brilliant,
[00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:58.885]   astonishing, really just, you know, amazing uses of disinformation by the spy state.
[00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:12.298]  See, they know that COVID was a lab leak, and they've hidden that for two years, probably for our own benefit, probably because of what smart, strategic geniuses they are, that we can't know the truth.
[00:39:12.318 --> 00:39:17.141]  They have to feed us lies to get us to do things that we wouldn't do otherwise because of how much they love us, right?
[00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:17.601]  Obviously.
[00:39:18.766 --> 00:39:21.588]  But of course, all of this, again, deeply intertwined.
[00:39:21.668 --> 00:39:23.990]  It wasn't COVID that destroyed our supply lines.
[00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:36.080]  It wasn't COVID that caused massive inequality and consolidated so much control into the hands of a very few corporations while shutting down tens of thousands of small businesses across the United States.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.962]  That was the policy of the government that did that.
[00:39:39.202 --> 00:39:40.523]  They used COVID as an excuse.
[00:39:41.647 --> 00:39:46.477]  Of course the lockdowns didn't work even a little bit when it came to stopping COVID.
[00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:47.459]  We've been over this.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.341]  We get this.
[00:39:49.884 --> 00:39:50.685]  Isn't it interesting?
[00:39:51.025 --> 00:39:58.029]  Isn't it interesting how everything the United States government does seems to backfire in the faces of the American people?
[00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:19.194]   And just like with the lockdowns destroying the supply chain and bringing the food supply to the brink of destruction, it looks like our involvement and our actions with the war in Ukraine are going to push us right over that edge and completely destroy Not us, we'll be fine, but the third world will be totally screwed and guess where they'll go?
[00:40:21.215 --> 00:40:22.576]  Guess what's gonna happen next?
[00:40:23.136 --> 00:40:35.582]  We're going to collapse all of the wheat supply, all of the calories that the world needs to survive, and then when the shipments to the third world stop, we'll invite them all here.
[00:40:37.022 --> 00:40:37.683]  It'll be amazing.
[00:40:37.743 --> 00:40:42.225]  It'll be like the migrant crisis in Europe times a million all over the world.
[00:40:43.373 --> 00:40:44.954]  And I'm sure the globalists hate that, right?
[00:40:44.994 --> 00:40:45.854]  That's not their plan.
[00:40:45.894 --> 00:40:46.995]  That's not what they're trying to do.
[00:40:47.015 --> 00:40:53.258]  It's just an unfortunate side effect of all the policies that they endlessly pursue, despite the fact that they know this will be the outcome.
[00:40:54.118 --> 00:40:55.079]  It's all a plan.
[00:40:55.199 --> 00:41:01.142]  If you really think that all of this is not by design, I really don't know what to tell you.
[00:41:01.162 --> 00:41:11.962]   I don't know if you can wake up after two years of COVID, you don't have the slightest suspicion, you don't have a bit of skepticism there in your mind, then I'm sorry, you're just not going to make it.
[00:41:12.543 --> 00:41:13.565]  Let's go now to this video.
[00:41:13.585 --> 00:41:22.642]  This is an astrophysicist explaining the collapse of the supply chain and the ensuing destruction that will soon come.
[00:41:22.682 --> 00:41:22.963]  Here it is.
[00:41:26.687 --> 00:41:28.308]  15% of the world's calories come from wheat.
[00:41:28.648 --> 00:41:30.789]  About a third of that wheat comes from Russia, Ukraine.
[00:41:30.929 --> 00:41:32.550]  Russia has banned export of wheat.
[00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.951]  The wheat spring planting season is like now, this week.
[00:41:36.452 --> 00:41:38.032]  And there's not a lot of planting going on.
[00:41:38.092 --> 00:41:49.177]  So not only is the current wheat supply in Russia, Ukraine blocked up and cannot make its way to countries in Africa and elsewhere, but the future planting season is now significantly at risk.
[00:41:49.197 --> 00:41:51.138]  And again, that's 15% of global calories.
[00:41:51.818 --> 00:41:56.760]  And just to take a step back, the whole planet Earth operates on a 90-day food supply.
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.001]  Once we stop making food, humans run out of food in 90 days.
[00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:02.862]  And that's not just linearly across all nations.
[00:42:02.902 --> 00:42:09.964]  What happens is the most vulnerable nations lose their food supply first, and the richer nations buy that food supply to secure their population.
[00:42:10.184 --> 00:42:16.103]   And so you very quickly see a bifurcation happen where suddenly famine is a real risk.
[00:42:16.103 --> 00:42:21.984]   And we already have about 800 million people on earth that are subsisting on below 1200
[00:42:21.984 --> 00:42:22.984]  calories a day.
[00:42:22.984 --> 00:42:27.984]   So this very quickly tips the bucket in a significant way in a number of countries that's
[00:42:27.984 --> 00:42:29.984]  going to be really awful.
[00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:33.504]   And that's just on the wheat supply and wheat planting problem.
[00:42:33.504 --> 00:42:38.624]   Yeah, it doesn't even get into the fertilizer collapse, the lack of energy.
[00:42:38.945 --> 00:42:40.746]  It's gonna get bad, folks.
[00:42:40.786 --> 00:42:50.312]  We are about to see waves and waves of death, whether it's by starvation, or whether it's by the riots that the food shortages will soon cause, or by the...
[00:42:51.291 --> 00:42:56.314]  You know, endless migration into first world countries from the third world countries once they start to collapse.
[00:42:57.095 --> 00:43:12.709]   Again, it's not a coincidence that all of this falls perfectly in line with the globalist agenda, just like it's not a coincidence that China has taken over From America's economic domination of the world.
[00:43:12.729 --> 00:43:25.227]  It's like you always hear these people, whether it's Klaus Schwab or Joe Biden or anybody else going, well, China is going to be the next the next big central power in the world as if they're not the ones doing it as if they're not the ones.
[00:43:26.539 --> 00:43:31.061]  Outsourcing the jobs to China and destroying manufacturing here in the United States.
[00:43:32.081 --> 00:43:37.304]  Everything we deal with at InfoWars, it's not natural consequence.
[00:43:37.324 --> 00:43:42.846]  It's not a hurricane that hits America that we all have to just buckle down and deal with because you just have to.
[00:43:42.926 --> 00:43:45.507]  It's this natural force that is out of your control.
[00:43:45.707 --> 00:43:47.928]  All of this is in the control of the globalists.
[00:43:48.109 --> 00:44:05.889]   They enact these policies knowing that this is going to be the outcome in a very simple Problem or reaction solution paradigm for which they have the answer and the answer is of course submission to them and total control by a centralized government.
[00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.790]  It's gonna get bad folks.
[00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:11.932]  It's gonna get really bad and don't say that Infowars didn't warn you.
[00:44:12.232 --> 00:44:16.494]  We've warned you for the last two years of where this was gonna go since they first announced the lockdown.
[00:44:16.514 --> 00:44:17.695]  It has been hard to figure out.
[00:44:17.715 --> 00:44:20.357]  It's actually been hard to ignore.
[00:44:20.617 --> 00:44:22.518]  I don't know how you people keep doing it.
[00:44:23.298 --> 00:44:24.079]  We'll be back on the other side.
[00:44:23.899 --> 00:44:42.859]  Stay tuned.
[00:44:42.809 --> 00:44:44.891]  And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:48.874]  Thomas Jefferson quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:44:49.174 --> 00:44:50.035]  It's a coin I designed.
[00:44:50.095 --> 00:44:50.956]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:53.378]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[00:44:53.998 --> 00:44:59.423]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[00:45:00.143 --> 00:45:03.144]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly.
[00:45:03.224 --> 00:45:06.805]  And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:08.966]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[00:45:08.986 --> 00:45:11.907]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[00:45:12.586 --> 00:45:17.266]   and without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:19.306]   We would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem.
[00:45:19.306 --> 00:45:22.907]   So as a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and
[00:45:22.907 --> 00:45:25.987]   freedom, and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[00:45:25.987 --> 00:45:30.786]   So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new world order at
[00:45:30.786 --> 00:45:32.867]  1776 coin.com.
[00:45:32.867 --> 00:45:41.945]   Joe Biden's federal bunglers of injustice, the FBI and the federal prosecutors.
[00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:46.907]   Once again, fumbled their first amendment violating undercover operations after
[00:45:46.907 --> 00:45:51.907]   misleading a federal court seeking unwarranted gag orders during a federal
[00:45:51.907 --> 00:45:56.945]   investigation of project Veritas's ties to the alleged theft of a diary
[00:45:56.945 --> 00:46:01.067]  belonging to president Joe Biden's daughter, Ashley Biden.
[00:46:01.212 --> 00:46:23.406]  Politico claimed that the raids generated controversy in some circles because Project Veritas identifies itself as a news organization and the use of search warrants against journalists and news outlets is extremely rare due to Justice Department policies and a federal law passed in 1980 to limit such investigative steps.
[00:46:23.786 --> 00:46:28.009]  After Project Veritas was raided Roger Stone style, U.S.
[00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:49.006]  District Court Judge Annalisa Torres agreed to a request by Project Veritas to appoint a special master to review the info on their seized devices to ensure that prosecutors couldn't get access to their emails, their text messages, and other records that might be subject to attorney-client privileges.
[00:46:49.206 --> 00:47:10.818]  Lo and behold, Project Veritas' attorneys have now learned that for nearly a year before the raids even occurred, prosecutors had already used gag orders within grand jury subpoenas and court-ordered seizures of all of the emails O'Keefe and several Project Veritas colleagues kept during a three-month span in 2020.
[00:47:11.778 --> 00:47:20.226]  Project Veritas is just one example of the war being waged on those who wield their First Amendment rights in a bid to expose the truth.
[00:47:20.646 --> 00:47:32.457]  Recently, the EU president tweeted that the state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik and their subsidiaries will no longer be able to spread lies to justify Putin's war and announced a ban on these outlets.
[00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:40.017]   Say what you want about invasive Russian propaganda, the censorship of RT and Sputnik cancels any dialogue from
[00:47:40.017 --> 00:47:41.157]  the opposing side.
[00:47:41.157 --> 00:47:47.637]   Meanwhile, Infowars faces down a Sandy Hook lawsuit engineered to set a precedent to cancel any news
[00:47:47.637 --> 00:47:51.076]   organization that questions the mainstream media narrative,
[00:47:51.076 --> 00:47:56.356]   leading to the inevitability that all dissent, even by individuals, will be outlawed.
[00:47:56.356 --> 00:48:00.637]   They start out with demonizing me that I believe in a new world order
[00:48:00.637 --> 00:48:03.317]  and a global government.
[00:48:03.317 --> 00:48:08.717]   And of course, just last week, the Davos group, Matt, announced world government planetary control.
[00:48:08.747 --> 00:48:16.575]  And the title of this session, are we ready for a new world order?
[00:48:17.015 --> 00:48:33.324]   And they're really thinking, with this lawsuit, they're going to outlaw questioning big events like WMDs in Iraq or Jesse Smollett or any of these things that have happened and that questioning these and and and looking at the evidence and information is a crime.
[00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:36.546]  But here's the big takeaway and I'll just admit it.
[00:48:37.796 --> 00:48:39.317]  I could have done a better job on Sandy Hook.
[00:48:39.477 --> 00:48:44.779]  Some of the anomalies that we reported on were not accurate, and I admitted it years before I was sued.
[00:48:45.499 --> 00:48:55.963]  But the issue is, this is all about them being holier than thou, and they're the arbiters of truth, and they're the Democrats, and they're the ones that love you, and Alex Jones is the devil.
[00:48:56.363 --> 00:49:02.946]  To distract from how the corporate media has been caught lying to people consciously about WMDs, the list, literally.
[00:49:04.006 --> 00:49:27.071]   Goes on and on and what's crazy is the public's basically totally woken up not just here, but around the world And nothing they're doing is reversing that but they pick these weird neurotic subjects like January 6th where Alex Jones and Sandy Hook and they just obsess like a religion on that and Meanwhile, I'm here in Connecticut Everywhere I go, I'm just shaking hands.
[00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:29.513]  Black, white, old, young, oh, Alex Jones.
[00:49:29.954 --> 00:49:31.054]  But a lot of them are mad at me.
[00:49:31.074 --> 00:49:32.996]  They go, hey, we questioned Sandy Hook.
[00:49:33.016 --> 00:49:33.957]  Why are you backing off?
[00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:42.266]  And these folks don't even get up on their big ivory tower law firms that the world has moved on from their BS.
[00:49:42.326 --> 00:49:43.406]  And yeah, do I make mistakes?
[00:49:43.466 --> 00:49:43.726]  Yes.
[00:49:44.066 --> 00:49:48.889]  But I don't lie on purpose like the corporate media does on record.
[00:49:49.009 --> 00:49:56.633]  And so I had the impression watching the attack on Mr. Jones that this trial will be about something far greater than what happened at Sandy Hook.
[00:49:56.673 --> 00:50:01.975]  The trial is going to be about ordinary people's ability to say, I'm not buying it.
[00:50:02.075 --> 00:50:03.096]  I want to raise questions.
[00:50:03.256 --> 00:50:04.777]  I want to draw my own conclusions.
[00:50:05.177 --> 00:50:15.661]  I mean, for those of us who missed the McCarthy era, I guess this president is intent on bringing it to us, but with new force and new power and new urgency, unlike anything we've ever seen.
[00:50:15.841 --> 00:50:30.406]  The federal government, aided by tech overlords and a deeply propagandized media, is yet again flagrantly violating and abusing First Amendment rights in order to satisfy the dictatorial demands of the creeping agenda of the New World Order.
[00:50:30.606 --> 00:50:31.706]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:38.335]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, this is the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:38.455 --> 00:50:40.257]  Alex is still on route.
[00:50:41.819 --> 00:50:46.844]  The problem, the problem is that we used to live in a first world country and that's not so much the case anymore.
[00:50:46.864 --> 00:50:53.053]   I'm sure you've seen the headlines recently about the Backups at the Austin airport.
[00:50:53.113 --> 00:50:54.313]  It's like we don't have enough fuel.
[00:50:54.994 --> 00:51:00.217]  It's just endless lines, people just like abandoning their rental cars on the side of the road.
[00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:10.684]  It's just, you know, you grew up maybe in a nation that was able to take care of itself, where everything ran pretty well, where if you had a problem, you could, you know, bring it up and it'd get solved pretty quickly.
[00:51:10.744 --> 00:51:11.985]  Like, those days are over.
[00:51:12.065 --> 00:51:13.286]  Those don't exist anymore.
[00:51:13.806 --> 00:51:26.196]   We're in a weird sort of anarcho-tyranny setup now where The government has no reason and no desire, it seems, to fulfill any of their obligations, but you will be held to the highest standards.
[00:51:26.216 --> 00:51:29.219]  And if you mess up even a little bit, well, now you're a domestic terrorist.
[00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.420]  And you questioned us?
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.582]  Prepare to go to prison.
[00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:36.025]  Austin Airport running low on fuel is Texas Capitol's latest growing pain.
[00:51:38.342 --> 00:51:40.185]  That's because of our growing pains, obviously.
[00:51:40.867 --> 00:51:46.698]  Just like how, you know, all the crime that we're seeing spiking across the country is probably because of climate change, if I had to guess.
[00:51:47.279 --> 00:51:48.842]  If it was anything, it's got to be one of those.
[00:51:48.862 --> 00:51:50.404]  Of course, we know.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:57.160]   At COVID, while it may seem like it's over, you may be able to walk around now and see
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:02.280]   smiling faces and go into restaurants and actually sit down and order.
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:08.239]   Life is returning to normal, and this is the loosening of the boa constrictor.
[00:52:08.239 --> 00:52:09.840]  It'll tighten again.
[00:52:10.834 --> 00:52:13.736]  We will once again be under the strictest orders.
[00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:17.618]  And it looks like Shanghai is sort of a testing ground.
[00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:20.100]  Sort of a vision into our future, perhaps.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:24.423]  Here you see the lovely doctors helping somebody.
[00:52:24.803 --> 00:52:25.624]  It's for your health.
[00:52:26.825 --> 00:52:27.986]  These are fists of peace.
[00:52:28.046 --> 00:52:29.046]  Oh, they're all getting in on it.
[00:52:29.747 --> 00:52:30.647]  Throw the guy on the ground.
[00:52:31.408 --> 00:52:32.349]  Did he do something wrong?
[00:52:32.469 --> 00:52:32.809]  Maybe.
[00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.490]  Maybe not.
[00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:35.491]  Who's to say?
[00:52:35.511 --> 00:52:47.986]   If you're a radio listener, we are Literally watching a man run away from like 12 people in hazmat suits as they savagely beat him.
[00:52:48.886 --> 00:52:50.206]  It's just, it's for your health though.
[00:52:50.926 --> 00:52:52.687]  It's because they care so much about you.
[00:52:53.387 --> 00:52:54.327]  They love you so much.
[00:52:55.867 --> 00:52:57.568]  Now they're, what, they're hitting him with a tree?
[00:52:57.628 --> 00:52:58.348]  What is going on?
[00:52:58.368 --> 00:53:03.289]  All that's going on is it's, it's total biotechnocratic tyranny.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.079]  on every level to the highest extreme.
[00:53:07.079 --> 00:53:09.360]  And let's go to some more videos of this.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:13.119]   Let's go to the one titled, This is the Future the Elites Want.
[00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:16.119]  We see an example of what's happening in Shanghai.
[00:53:16.119 --> 00:53:18.559]  I'm gonna go ahead and roll as B-roll.
[00:53:18.559 --> 00:53:24.320]   Because they are essentially implementing the COVID passport like they're trying to do
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.840]   across the world, and we'll talk about how they're getting to that.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:29.239]  But in Shanghai, you have to have a COVID pass.
[00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:32.079]  If it's green, then you're free to go, everything's normal.
[00:53:32.079 --> 00:53:35.599]   If it's red, however, you're gonna be sent to a COVID camp.
[00:53:35.599 --> 00:53:37.759]  You're gonna be sent to a quarantine camp.
[00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:42.840]   Even if you're a child, even if you're just a little baby child, they will rip you away
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:45.640]  from your parents and send you off to a quarantine camp.
[00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:47.192]  Here we see all of the citizens of this country.
[00:53:47.752 --> 00:53:49.273]  This is you in the future, America!
[00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:50.494]  This is where we're going.
[00:53:50.514 --> 00:53:51.314]  This is where we're headed.
[00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:52.374]  Oh, you're walking down the street?
[00:53:52.634 --> 00:53:54.375]  Down on the ground, on your knees.
[00:53:54.615 --> 00:53:56.516]  Show us your passport.
[00:53:57.556 --> 00:53:58.076]  Oh, you're red?
[00:53:58.257 --> 00:53:59.057]  Get in the van.
[00:53:59.697 --> 00:54:00.778]  Say goodbye to your family.
[00:54:00.878 --> 00:54:01.558]  No, scratch that.
[00:54:01.578 --> 00:54:02.678]  There's no time to say goodbye.
[00:54:02.758 --> 00:54:03.178]  You're gone.
[00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:03.859]  You're disappeared.
[00:54:03.899 --> 00:54:04.259]  It's over.
[00:54:06.525 --> 00:54:07.465]  Really brutal stuff.
[00:54:07.585 --> 00:54:15.248]  And, I mean, just, if you want to know what America's going to look like in the future, just type Shanghai into Google and see what we got.
[00:54:15.288 --> 00:54:21.531]  Now this guy, and we can turn up the audio on this if we want, he's from Beijing, and he's trapped in Shanghai.
[00:54:21.571 --> 00:54:22.851]  He can't get out of Shanghai.
[00:54:22.871 --> 00:54:28.993]  He's literally on his knees, begging, pointing at his ID, going, I just want to go home.
[00:54:29.093 --> 00:54:31.134]  Please, for the love of God, just let me go home.
[00:54:32.195 --> 00:54:33.235]  He's appealing.
[00:54:33.535 --> 00:54:35.636]  He's appealing to the good nature of the state.
[00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:41.301]  And he's coming up completely empty because they despise you and they want nothing but your submission.
[00:54:43.803 --> 00:54:48.807]  So that, I mean, the number of videos coming out of Shanghai right now is really astonishing.
[00:54:50.088 --> 00:54:50.688]  The brutality.
[00:54:50.708 --> 00:54:53.851]  It's being, oh my god, I haven't even seen this one.
[00:54:54.912 --> 00:55:05.781]  Here's the police standing around in a circle as the doctor here, the nurse, in his hazmat suit, is stomping on the head of a poor infected patient.
[00:55:06.991 --> 00:55:07.811]  For your health, folks.
[00:55:09.012 --> 00:55:10.352]  It's all for your health.
[00:55:11.773 --> 00:55:16.354]  From Washington Post, China said its COVID strategy was superior, but it's failing in Shanghai.
[00:55:16.494 --> 00:55:17.995]  I don't know, it seems to be working perfectly.
[00:55:19.215 --> 00:55:21.176]  Seems to be working incredibly well, actually.
[00:55:22.276 --> 00:55:30.379]  People are unable to question you, be beaten by doctors, have to be begging on your hands and knees just to go about your daily business.
[00:55:30.479 --> 00:55:35.821]  I think all this is working exactly as designed, and here they are, carting away children!
[00:55:36.775 --> 00:55:37.355]  Hey, that's good.
[00:55:38.036 --> 00:55:38.716]  That's what we need.
[00:55:39.297 --> 00:55:40.357]  It's all about COVID, right?
[00:55:41.818 --> 00:55:44.620]  Even New York Times is sort of questioning this.
[00:55:46.401 --> 00:55:48.482]  High-tech kidnapping here going on.
[00:55:50.564 --> 00:55:53.225]  There's a child in full hazmat suit.
[00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:57.428]  I mean... It would be funny.
[00:55:57.668 --> 00:56:02.191]  It would be comical if it wasn't coming here and if it wasn't happening to real people.
[00:56:04.195 --> 00:56:10.819]  And if it wasn't, you know, actual signs of really just brutal overreach by the government.
[00:56:11.299 --> 00:56:16.282]  From New York Times, Shanghai seethes in COVID lockdown, posing test to China's leadership.
[00:56:16.422 --> 00:56:27.748]  Residents in Shanghai, China's most populous and cosmopolitan city, in Shanghai, China's most populous and cosmopolitan city, have responded to the government's pursuit of zero COVID with a rare outpouring of criticism.
[00:56:28.688 --> 00:56:32.691]  See, it's a rare outpouring of criticism because you're not allowed to criticize them.
[00:56:33.769 --> 00:56:37.490]  It's very rare to have criticism when you ban criticism.
[00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:39.931]  That's what the tyrants are figuring out.
[00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:46.253]  Parents have organized petitions imploring the government not to separate children infected with coronavirus from their families.
[00:56:46.873 --> 00:56:52.395]  Parents have demanded to speak with higher-ups about shoddy conditions at isolation facilities.
[00:56:52.475 --> 00:57:00.138]  Residents have confronted officials over containment policies that they see as unfair or inhumane, then shared recordings of those arguments online.
[00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:07.619]  So I guess in a way, it's sort of a double-edged sword, right?
[00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:19.068]  On one hand, we are staring at a horrific, dystopian, hellish nightmare that is in place right now on the planet Earth, like it's happening.
[00:57:19.568 --> 00:57:24.091]  This is taking place and nobody in America seems to be against this.
[00:57:25.012 --> 00:57:32.735]  Right, if you take a kidnap victim away from their kidnapper on the southern border, they will scream and cry that you're separating children from their parents.
[00:57:32.795 --> 00:57:35.596]  But, oh, when it comes to COVID, you take the kids.
[00:57:35.736 --> 00:57:40.038]  Take the kids away from their parents, isolate them in a government facility, and do with them what you will.
[00:57:40.438 --> 00:57:41.559]  Maybe steal their organs.
[00:57:42.259 --> 00:57:43.459]  Y'all read that article recently?
[00:57:43.539 --> 00:57:45.280]  Cutting out hearts to kill people in China?
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.401]  I mean, just utterly brutal, right?
[00:57:48.582 --> 00:57:49.382]  And that's on one hand.
[00:57:49.502 --> 00:57:54.304]  On the other hand, at a certain point, you cannot hold humanity down like this.
[00:57:55.504 --> 00:58:03.294]  Even people in China who are so conditioned with the social credit score and the brutal communist tactics are not standing for this.
[00:58:03.674 --> 00:58:06.618]  They're fighting back against it and the grip is slipping.
[00:58:06.778 --> 00:58:12.245]  The more they squeeze, the more the people of Shanghai are slipping out of their grip.
[00:58:13.257 --> 00:58:18.665]  But they're using, again, just the most dystopian tactics possible from Business Insider for Insider.com.
[00:58:19.066 --> 00:58:27.958]  Shanghai is flying drones over district to tell citizens under lockdown to, quote, curb your soul's desire for freedom and comply with COVID-19 restrictions.
[00:58:29.315 --> 00:58:32.737]  Please destroy your soul for us.
[00:58:33.158 --> 00:58:33.778]  Here you have the drone.
[00:58:33.798 --> 00:58:34.979]  Let's pull the audio up on this.
[00:58:34.999 --> 00:58:47.928]  So what was happening here is residents in Shanghai, since they are forbidden from going outside, forbidden from leaving their abodes, they're instead opening windows and going on their balconies and singing in protest.
[00:58:49.827 --> 00:58:59.673]  And so then China sends out a flashing drone with a large loudspeaker to demand people go inside and, quote, curb your soul's desire for freedom.
[00:59:02.075 --> 00:59:05.877]  Replace it with your soul's desire to conform to the demands of the state.
[00:59:08.379 --> 00:59:12.021]  I'm telling you, I've just, I've literally never seen anything like what's happening in Shanghai.
[00:59:13.442 --> 00:59:15.183]  And it is almost certainly coming here.
[00:59:15.223 --> 00:59:18.045]  Did we have one more video I wanted to go to or did we get to all of them?
[00:59:19.158 --> 00:59:19.979]  I think that may be all of them.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.901]  That should be enough, right?
[00:59:24.082 --> 00:59:31.528]  Drones flying around yelling at people to shut their windows and stop seeing, and to curb their soul's demand for freedom.
[00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:45.100]  Being able to demand that you take out your phone at a moment's notice, get on your knees and present to them your movement passport, and should it flash red, haul you off in a van to a quarantine camp.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:46.501]  Because it's all for your safety, right?
[00:59:48.575 --> 00:59:49.875]  They're pushing the limits here, folks.
[00:59:50.156 --> 00:59:51.616]  This may be a beta test.
[00:59:51.836 --> 00:59:53.136]  That may be what's happening here.
[00:59:53.397 --> 01:00:00.779]  They've chosen one city to go, how far can we push it before we export these tactics to the wider world?
[01:00:01.639 --> 01:00:02.740]  COVID is not over, folks.
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.300]  It's just getting started.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.181]  And the dystopia is coming.
[01:00:07.201 --> 01:00:08.902]  All right, welcome back.
[01:00:09.062 --> 01:00:11.282]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.302 --> 01:00:11.923]  I'm Harrison Smith.
[01:00:12.963 --> 01:00:14.724]  Alex Jones is on his way.
[01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:15.624]  I promise he is.
[01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:18.771]  Certain things you have to go through.
[01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:23.133]  Anyway.
[01:00:23.713 --> 01:00:27.575]  Honestly, I'm hosting the War Room after this.
[01:00:27.595 --> 01:00:28.975]  It's going to be a busy day for me.
[01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:31.476]  But God, can you imagine being anywhere else right now?
[01:00:31.536 --> 01:00:32.917]  Where else would I rather be?
[01:00:33.057 --> 01:00:35.298]  This is the crux of the battle.
[01:00:35.578 --> 01:00:42.922]  I'm in the middle of the crucible right now in the most epic battle for the fate of humanity the world has ever seen.
[01:00:44.022 --> 01:00:56.275]  My God, what an honor it is to be with you, and I'm so glad you're here with us, and I hope that you support us by going to InfoWarsStore.com, whether it's the American Journal in the morning, or the War Room in the afternoon, or the Alex Jones Show here at midday.
[01:00:56.475 --> 01:01:03.202]  Everything is brought to you entirely by InfoWarsStore, and the discounts that we give you are really unprecedented.
[01:01:04.203 --> 01:01:04.683]  Unimaginable.
[01:01:04.703 --> 01:01:05.904]  When's the last time you got 75% off anything ever?
[01:01:08.995 --> 01:01:13.819]  I mean, my wife gets these coupons for like 25% off some store and she saves them for months.
[01:01:13.979 --> 01:01:16.041]  It's like, wow, 25% off, that's huge.
[01:01:16.401 --> 01:01:18.442]  75% off, we're practically asking you to steal from us.
[01:01:19.103 --> 01:01:28.390]  But of course, it all goes towards supporting this program and everything we do here at InfoWars, including Bandod Video and the incredible content creators that post there on a regular basis.
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:37.037]  Whether it's the supplements, the t-shirts, the survival gear, there are gifts there for anybody that may have an event coming up.
[01:01:38.171 --> 01:02:02.445]   Get the t-shirts at cost just an incredible sale and these are going to be collectors items folks a lot of these designs these t-shirt designs will never come back so heck buy one for yourself buy one for a friend and buy one just to keep in a closet somewhere and sell on eBay in 20 years we don't care be a capitalist it's awesome and also you know while I'm on it the collectible silver coin We're running out very rapidly.
[01:02:02.566 --> 01:02:07.367]  I don't know if we'll make it through today before selling all of them out, but make sure to get yours now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:02:07.407 --> 01:02:08.767]  We really do appreciate it.
[01:02:09.568 --> 01:02:15.449]  And again, we're here to tell you, tomorrow's news today, COVID has not gone anywhere.
[01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:18.670]  In fact, it is almost certainly coming back pretty soon.
[01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:26.593]  And as right side Fred posts this screenshot from Good Morning Britain, COVID is everywhere and it's anything.
[01:02:27.574 --> 01:02:30.455]  And you need to be scared of just literally anything.
[01:02:31.015 --> 01:02:46.701]  They have COVID's nine new symptoms, and they include shortness of breath, feeling tired, aching body, headache, sore throat, blocked or running nose, lack of appetite, diarrhea, or feeling sick or being sick.
[01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:48.042]  That's right, folks.
[01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:57.726]   If you're sick or feeling sick, or if you're just not hungry, maybe you have a sore throat, If you're just tired, that's COVID, folks.
[01:02:58.206 --> 01:02:59.568]  You need to lock down immediately.
[01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:01.670]  It's just absurd.
[01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:09.298]  But, again, they're keeping this, you know, just pump it up every once in a while, keep it in people's minds, keep it in the forefront of their awareness.
[01:03:10.159 --> 01:03:17.126]  Just keep them ready for the next big whatever variant they're going to come up with.
[01:03:18.356 --> 01:03:27.986]  And of course, all of this psychological operation of COVID is towards a single goal, which is global government.
[01:03:30.162 --> 01:03:35.287]  Through the biotechnocratic control of our very financial systems.
[01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.408]  Now there is a bit of good news.
[01:03:37.448 --> 01:03:45.135]  I do have one little data point of good news and that is that mandatory vaccines for people 60 and over has been defeated in Germany.
[01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:55.839]   They were trying to mandate vaccines, the fourth booster shot, I believe, for Anybody 60 or over, and that has been defeated as of this morning in the German Parliament.
[01:03:55.859 --> 01:03:56.439]  So that's good.
[01:03:56.739 --> 01:03:57.260]  That's nice.
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:58.340]  And you also have this.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.442]  European health agencies say it's too early for second boosters in most people.
[01:04:03.961 --> 01:04:08.760]   So just wait a little bit. Just wait a little bit. The booster will come. It'll be here. It'll be there for you.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:16.060]   We already approved it here, of course. It was an easy thing to approve it once you silenced the experts.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:21.160]   The FDA, in approving their newest booster, didn't even ask the experts.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.361]   In fact, they'd passed the booster. They'd approved the booster before they even brought them in.
[01:04:26.509 --> 01:04:37.133]  The article, I believe it was from Infowars, said, you know, basically this is like asking lawyers to present a case for a judge who had already issued a ruling of guilty or not guilty.
[01:04:37.173 --> 01:04:46.438]  So, they approved the Booster, they allowed the Booster, and then they asked the experts about the Booster, and then they ignored what the experts said.
[01:04:47.078 --> 01:04:49.219]  But here's a very interesting story from Epoch Times.
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.040]  From yesterday.
[01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:58.627]  Memo reveals State Department assessed in early 2020 that a lab leak was the most likely origin of COVID-19.
[01:04:58.667 --> 01:05:00.489]  A newly released memo from the U.S.
[01:05:00.509 --> 01:05:07.635]  State Department reveals that government officials knew very early on in the COVID pandemic that it likely originated at a lab in Wuhan, China.
[01:05:08.136 --> 01:05:15.803]  That memo, dated April 2020, suggests that out of five possible origins for COVID, a lab leak was by far the most likely.
[01:05:16.343 --> 01:05:23.368]  The memo also suggested that alternative theories had been introduced to prevent a lab leak from being investigated.
[01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:30.994]  The memo, which focused almost entirely on the likelihood of a lab leak, contains a large amount of information that wasn't known publicly at the time it was written.
[01:05:31.334 --> 01:05:35.738]  Well, you know, it was known publicly, it was just censored.
[01:05:36.038 --> 01:05:36.478]  Endlessly.
[01:05:37.279 --> 01:05:44.825]  It was just that if you tried to tell the truth about what was going on with COVID, you would be kicked off of the internet, and if you were a doctor, you might have your license pulled.
[01:05:46.957 --> 01:05:49.138]  And if you were a broadcaster, you might be fired from your job.
[01:05:49.818 --> 01:06:01.083]  And if you were anybody, you would be ridiculed by the lemmings in our country that will mindlessly repeat whatever lies that they're told.
[01:06:01.883 --> 01:06:08.806]  Although a lab leak is now widely accepted as a likely origin for the virus, when the memo was written, a concerted effort was underway to discredit that possibility.
[01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:09.986]  And I remember this.
[01:06:10.006 --> 01:06:14.028]  I'm sure info warriors out there had this same experience early on in the pandemic.
[01:06:15.356 --> 01:06:16.617]  I mean, it was an IQ test, right?
[01:06:16.857 --> 01:06:18.277]  The pandemic is an IQ test.
[01:06:19.438 --> 01:06:24.520]  When they present to you, just like, I'm sure you've seen the skit during the breaks, right?
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.561]  It was like, well, you got two options here.
[01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:27.461]  It came from right here.
[01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:45.351]   And within this little circle of, you know, ground zero for COVID, you have a farmer's market and you have a level four bioweapons lab with doing experiments on gain-of-function research with coronaviruses that has a history of Security faults.
[01:06:46.352 --> 01:06:47.052]  And it's one of those.
[01:06:47.172 --> 01:06:50.354]  It's either the farmer's market or it's the bioweapons lab.
[01:06:50.454 --> 01:06:52.055]  Which one do you think it came out of?
[01:06:52.135 --> 01:06:55.277]  And most people in America failed this very simple test.
[01:06:55.297 --> 01:06:57.458]  They went, oh, that farmer's market sounds dangerous.
[01:06:57.958 --> 01:07:01.140]  That farmer's market sounds like it might be a hotbed of viruses.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.621]  I'll go with that.
[01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:08.425]  And I remember early on in the pandemic, you know, just knowing this, just being aware this, this had taken place.
[01:07:08.445 --> 01:07:09.805]  The video is on Bandod Video.
[01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:14.048]  You can see me in front of the White House on January 20th, 2020.
[01:07:15.149 --> 01:07:15.329]  Right?
[01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:17.010]  Is that what it was?
[01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:17.010]  2019?
[01:07:17.531 --> 01:07:18.892]  My God, my years are getting all mixed up.
[01:07:21.132 --> 01:07:22.033]  2020, yeah, okay.
[01:07:22.393 --> 01:07:23.974]  So for some reason I was thinking January 6th was 2020.
[01:07:24.194 --> 01:07:39.744]   Yeah, so January 2020, before the word COVID or coronavirus had even made its appearance in the mainstream media, InfoWars was reporting not only that COVID was Spreading and that we should be doing things to prevent it from getting to these shores.
[01:07:39.784 --> 01:07:43.185]  We were also pointing out that the likely source was the lab leak.
[01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:48.146]  So early on, you know, talking to friends and going, yeah, probably came from a lab and they're just like, that's conspiracy theory.
[01:07:48.846 --> 01:07:49.807]  No, that's conspiracy theory.
[01:07:49.827 --> 01:07:53.468]  So it's like, wait, you didn't even know COVID existed five minutes ago.
[01:07:54.148 --> 01:08:01.350]  I've known for a month and now you're telling me it's conspiracy theory that it came from a lab that it most definitely came from.
[01:08:02.796 --> 01:08:29.507]   You really just have to be sort of, you really kind of have to admire the control that the mainstream media has over people's minds where it can be so obvious that the origin of this virus with its manufactured furin cleavage sites and its DNA profile that dates back as far as 2016 with the Moderna a trademarked virus.
[01:08:29.507 --> 01:08:34.507]   That before they even know about it, they know that the lab leak theory was a conspiracy.
[01:08:34.507 --> 01:08:36.947]  What do those people think now?
[01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:38.266]  I really have to wonder.
[01:08:38.266 --> 01:08:40.787]  We'll be right back.
[01:08:40.787 --> 01:08:45.346]   There truly is a war on for your mind, ladies and gentlemen, and we're here just to fight
[01:08:45.346 --> 01:08:47.827]  to get it back into your hands.
[01:08:47.827 --> 01:08:54.068]   Oh man, I have sort of the perfect story to cover for that statement too.
[01:08:54.061 --> 01:08:56.962]  But let me tell you, some shake-ups are happening here.
[01:08:57.342 --> 01:08:58.963]  Some reorganizations are going on.
[01:08:58.983 --> 01:09:04.006]  You will not be stuck with the Harrison Smith Show for nine hours today.
[01:09:04.466 --> 01:09:08.068]  It looks like I may get some respite.
[01:09:08.088 --> 01:09:09.709]  But I'm happy to do it.
[01:09:09.809 --> 01:09:12.471]  I just think the audience is probably sick of seeing me.
[01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:15.752]  But I'll be here for the remainder of this hour.
[01:09:16.133 --> 01:09:19.074]  Then Royce White will be taking over the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:19.715 --> 01:09:20.395]  Alex is on the way.
[01:09:20.435 --> 01:09:21.876]  He's been caught up a little bit.
[01:09:23.346 --> 01:09:29.346]   in air, with his flight, but he is on his way and he'll be here probably shortly after
[01:09:29.346 --> 01:09:31.306]  the start of the one o'clock hour.
[01:09:31.306 --> 01:09:37.306]   So he'll be here, then he'll take over the first hour of the war room, and I may or may not be
[01:09:37.306 --> 01:09:42.545]   hosting the war room, I think it may be Dr. Jane Ruby sitting in for me in the war room as well.
[01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:48.865]   But this is what, these are battlefield reformations, right, these are the battle formations being
[01:09:48.865 --> 01:09:58.626]   re-kajiggered so we can bring you all of the latest breaking news and cover it all with style.
[01:09:59.019 --> 01:10:00.942]  Remember, support us by going to infowarestore.com.
[01:10:00.982 --> 01:10:11.119]   We really do appreciate it and, you know, I was saying on the show earlier today, it's like It's like being in the mafia but you don't commit any crimes, right?
[01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:15.122]  It's just like indictments coming down and just like crazy stuff always happening.
[01:10:15.162 --> 01:10:17.224]  It's like we're just, we just try to read the news.
[01:10:17.244 --> 01:10:22.548]  I just print out articles and I talk about the news and then the authorities come stomping in.
[01:10:22.588 --> 01:10:23.189]  It's just, it's...
[01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:24.389]  It's insane.
[01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:29.813]  I would understand it if this was like The Sopranos and we're out there busting heads and robbing people.
[01:10:29.853 --> 01:10:31.314]  It's like, no, we're not.
[01:10:31.414 --> 01:10:32.395]  We've done nothing wrong.
[01:10:32.415 --> 01:10:35.277]  We've never done anything wrong and we can't get a break, right?
[01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:39.820]  We just hold a peaceful protest, you're under arrest to talk about the news, you're being sued.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:40.360]  It's just like...
[01:10:41.161 --> 01:10:41.901]  We can't get a break.
[01:10:42.402 --> 01:10:43.202]  And we'll keep fighting.
[01:10:43.262 --> 01:10:46.643]  I mean, you know, the harder they push, the harder we push back.
[01:10:46.703 --> 01:10:49.304]  So we're going to keep doing it as long as we possibly can.
[01:10:49.344 --> 01:10:50.505]  It's just entirely up to you.
[01:10:50.565 --> 01:10:52.605]  If you go to InfoWarsTore.com, we will be here.
[01:10:52.806 --> 01:10:54.106]  If you don't, we'll go away.
[01:10:54.186 --> 01:10:55.006]  It's as simple as that.
[01:10:55.507 --> 01:10:56.367]  I've said it before.
[01:10:57.127 --> 01:10:58.548]  We are an army on the march.
[01:10:58.848 --> 01:10:59.968]  The morale is high.
[01:10:59.988 --> 01:11:01.009]  The spirits are high.
[01:11:01.974 --> 01:11:04.256]  We're ready to march on to that next objective.
[01:11:04.436 --> 01:11:06.678]  It's just whether our supply line is intact.
[01:11:06.918 --> 01:11:11.602]  You know, the driver is willing, the foot is on the gas, pressing the pedal to the floor.
[01:11:11.622 --> 01:11:15.225]  It's just whether or not we have gas in the tank that will determine whether we get there.
[01:11:15.645 --> 01:11:17.027]  So, please, help us out.
[01:11:17.787 --> 01:11:21.510]  ReformOurSupplyLine at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:22.631]  We really do appreciate it.
[01:11:23.712 --> 01:11:24.772]  More than we can possibly say.
[01:11:25.033 --> 01:11:27.694]  Let's get back to this story from the Epoch Times.
[01:11:27.774 --> 01:11:33.756]  Memo reveals State Department assessed in early 2020 that the lab leak was most likely the origin of COVID-19.
[01:11:34.176 --> 01:11:48.182]  According to the newly released memo, the State Department knew as of April 2020 that the central issue surrounding an obsession with collecting and testing a massive amount of virus-carrying bats on the part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and China's Wuhan Located Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
[01:11:48.922 --> 01:11:57.548]  The State Department noted that the lab testing of the earliest known patient at the Wuhan Central Hospital in December 2019 determined the virus was a, quote, bat-SARS-like coronavirus.
[01:11:58.049 --> 01:12:02.992]  At the time this patient was tested, the Communist Party in China had not disclosed that there was a problem at all.
[01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:06.855]  And when they finally acknowledged an outbreak, they initially blamed it on pneumonia.
[01:12:07.075 --> 01:12:14.461]  It was only at the end of January that the CCP finally started admitting that January 19 was caused by a new virus that was transmitted between humans.
[01:12:14.881 --> 01:12:20.567]  By that time, the virus had already been seeded across the globe, and any chance at suppression had been lost.
[01:12:21.068 --> 01:12:35.083]  It was during that same time period that the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, was made aware of the virus's likely origin, having been told by a group of scientists whom he was funding that there was a high probability that the virus was engineered.
[01:12:36.206 --> 01:12:53.340]  And then he went on TV and lied to us continuously, and called us conspiracy theorists, and wrote letters to popular scientific publications to lie, to lie, to hide the truth, hide the reality, and in order to confound the American people?
[01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:58.952]  And allow them to act like this was all just a reaction to something that naturally occurred.
[01:12:59.372 --> 01:13:00.793]  Nothing about this was natural.
[01:13:00.833 --> 01:13:07.695]  Not the reaction, not the creation, and not the fact that Event 201 was held just a month or so before it came out.
[01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:15.826]   Again, if you can't have some bit of skepticism in you after these two years, I have a bridge to sell you.
[01:13:15.846 --> 01:13:18.527]  It's a wonderful bridge for a million dollars.
[01:13:18.587 --> 01:13:22.229]  Send your checks now because I'll send you the bridge momentarily.
[01:13:22.609 --> 01:13:23.910]  You really have to be that stupid.
[01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.870]  You really do.
[01:13:26.511 --> 01:13:27.271]  It's just insane.
[01:13:30.033 --> 01:13:31.253]  It's just absolutely wild.
[01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:47.129]   And it's really funny that We weren't allowed to talk about this and that people actually like went along with it and that like how many bio labs do we fund?
[01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:48.030]  Right?
[01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:51.173]  Just relating this back to what we were talking about earlier with the Ukrainian bio labs.
[01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:57.820]  Well, we have like a dozen biolabs that we fund with just tens of millions of dollars from American taxpayers.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.661]  We have labs in China.
[01:14:00.101 --> 01:14:03.243]  We have labs in everywhere else in the world, right?
[01:14:03.263 --> 01:14:05.544]  There's just millions of our dollars are pouring into.
[01:14:05.564 --> 01:14:09.206]  And of course, we look at that and we go, oh, you're doing bioweapons research.
[01:14:09.366 --> 01:14:14.989]   You're up to nefarious Stuff that's just no good for anybody.
[01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:16.590]  They go, no, absolutely not.
[01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:20.393]  No, the only reason that all of these labs exist is for one purpose.
[01:14:20.473 --> 01:14:24.335]  It's to identify and prevent emerging infectious diseases.
[01:14:24.715 --> 01:14:28.918]  It's like, okay, so where were you?
[01:14:29.999 --> 01:14:35.522]  What were you doing when there was a new infectious disease that was spreading for months and months and months?
[01:14:38.226 --> 01:14:41.948]  I mean, maybe it was just because we're at Infowars and we're tuned in to this sort of stuff.
[01:14:42.829 --> 01:14:51.994]  But for the entire month of January, during the first outbreak of COVID-19, we were watching YouTube streams of people going through news from China.
[01:14:53.206 --> 01:14:55.829]  You could go on 4chan and see entire threads, right?
[01:14:55.889 --> 01:14:56.629]  Corona-chan.
[01:14:56.649 --> 01:15:01.674]  There were comics of this personified coronavirus that people were making jokes out of.
[01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:03.376]  Like, everybody knew this was happening.
[01:15:03.436 --> 01:15:05.238]  The mainstream media must have missed this somehow.
[01:15:05.318 --> 01:15:09.522]  They must have just completely ignored all of these warning signs somehow.
[01:15:09.742 --> 01:15:11.764]  All of these labs that we fund.
[01:15:12.725 --> 01:15:16.728]  To be our outpost to identify the emerging infectious diseases?
[01:15:16.748 --> 01:15:17.968]  They were all just blind to this?
[01:15:18.208 --> 01:15:20.950]  Somehow a bunch of dudes on 4chan figured it out, but they couldn't?
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:21.951]  They missed this?
[01:15:22.731 --> 01:15:24.232]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:28.515]  So it's like, why are we funding these labs if they don't do the one thing they're supposed to do?
[01:15:30.016 --> 01:15:32.417]  Ah, because they do do that, and then they hide it.
[01:15:33.098 --> 01:15:33.938]  Right?
[01:15:33.998 --> 01:15:36.600]  So 59 labs around the world handle the deadliest pathogens.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.161]  Only a quarter score high on safety.
[01:15:40.282 --> 01:15:41.463]  Funded by your tax dollars.
[01:15:43.368 --> 01:15:52.635]  And carried out by the very same people that put us into lockdown, destroyed the economy, centralized so much wealth and power throughout the entire pandemic.
[01:15:54.276 --> 01:15:55.137]  And they're not giving it up.
[01:15:55.637 --> 01:15:56.458]  And it's not going away.
[01:15:57.259 --> 01:16:00.621]  G20 discuss universal vaccine passport and verifier.
[01:16:02.263 --> 01:16:09.928]  Assuming the presidency in the upcoming G20 summit, Indonesia has begun health working group meeting series, which began on the 28th and 30th of March 2022 in Indonesia.
[01:16:14.383 --> 01:16:23.713]  They seek to harmonize safe travel procedures worldwide, especially the recognition of COVID-19 vaccine certificates, in the wake of the devastating pandemic that ravaged countries across the globe.
[01:16:24.173 --> 01:16:31.501]  The HWG meeting was aimed to foster a dialogue in the health sector between participating countries and to synchronize global health protocols.
[01:16:32.222 --> 01:16:41.069]  Just like how the Event 201 organization was held to train people how to respond to the outbreak of an infectious disease out of Wuhan, China.
[01:16:41.490 --> 01:16:42.470]  That was a coronavirus.
[01:16:42.751 --> 01:16:43.911]  They knew all of the details.
[01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:45.953]  They had it all planned out.
[01:16:46.073 --> 01:16:46.854]  And what did they plan?
[01:16:46.874 --> 01:16:57.683]  They planned how to control the media, how to control the discussion about the outbreak, how to control vaccine skeptics, and how to silence them.
[01:16:57.743 --> 01:16:58.643]  That's what they planned.
[01:16:58.804 --> 01:17:09.194]   That's what they had in place before the virus Actually, hit us and hear from TruthTalk.UK, the NHS COVID-19 app, the little app that doesn't go away.
[01:17:10.415 --> 01:17:12.577]  Oh, you thought that was temporary?
[01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:17.322]  I'm sorry, you thought that was going away at some point?
[01:17:17.402 --> 01:17:18.583]  Why would that go away?
[01:17:19.164 --> 01:17:22.968]  Why would they release you from the trap once you'd fallen for it?
[01:17:24.844 --> 01:17:29.329]  It's like reading the MICE newspaper and it's like, the cheese is a trap!
[01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:33.234]  It's like, yeah, we know, we know, it's a big fat trap there to kill you.
[01:17:33.955 --> 01:17:34.676]  And you fell for it.
[01:17:35.376 --> 01:17:36.157]  And now you're surprised.
[01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:37.339]  You're surprised, apparently.
[01:17:37.919 --> 01:17:55.264]   It's recently been revealed that the UK Health Agency, Health Security Agency, I'm sorry, the Health Security Agency, Has been awarded a 2.46 million pound contract to the multinational digital technology company, Net Company, to develop, maintain, and support the NHS COVID-19 app, i.e.
[01:17:55.284 --> 01:17:58.006]  the contact tracing app, rather than the NHS app.
[01:17:59.366 --> 01:18:07.271]  And it's already been revealed that the police in Germany have used COVID contact tracing apps to track down criminals.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.966]  So if you think this is just sticking to health, and if you think it's going away anytime soon, we desperately need you to wake up.
[01:18:14.046 --> 01:18:15.528]  Please, for the love of God, wake up.
[01:18:15.568 --> 01:18:16.709]  Won't you wake up and help us?
[01:18:16.789 --> 01:18:18.211]  Please, for the love of God, help us.
[01:18:19.532 --> 01:18:20.593]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:20.613 --> 01:18:21.835]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:21.935 --> 01:18:23.757]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:18:23.777 --> 01:18:26.640]  You know what's amazing?
[01:18:28.162 --> 01:18:36.308]   I could spend Ten hours today, from the three hours of the American Journal to the four hours of the Alex Jones Show to the three hours of WARM.
[01:18:36.808 --> 01:18:43.733]  I could spend all those hours talking about just the news of just today, and I still wouldn't be able to cover it all.
[01:18:44.374 --> 01:18:45.034]  Isn't it incredible?
[01:18:45.535 --> 01:18:48.797]  I mean, I haven't even gotten to a lot of the stories that are some of the biggest.
[01:18:49.338 --> 01:18:52.440]  I really just want to read this one almost in full.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:56.243]  It's really an amazing article from The Sun, UK.
[01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:57.741]  Outlet.
[01:18:58.722 --> 01:18:59.163]  The title.
[01:18:59.243 --> 01:18:59.963]  The title's fantastic.
[01:19:00.544 --> 01:19:06.889]  Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse will, quote, steal your identity so you mindlessly conform, experts warn.
[01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:07.890]  Yeah.
[01:19:09.386 --> 01:19:11.888]  Yeah, that's what it's all about.
[01:19:12.348 --> 01:19:17.212]  Concerns over the metaverse's effect on individual identities have been growing among experts.
[01:19:18.012 --> 01:19:25.457]  As companies continue to push forward with plans to enter the metaverse, many questions are being raised about the future of digital identities online.
[01:19:26.198 --> 01:19:37.326]   Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has long been vocal about his plans for the metaverse, a digital world that will combine gaming, social media, augmented reality, and cryptocurrency for an integrated User prison.
[01:19:37.566 --> 01:19:38.267]  Experience.
[01:19:38.367 --> 01:19:38.607]  Sorry.
[01:19:38.687 --> 01:19:39.668]  User experience.
[01:19:40.689 --> 01:19:43.672]  The metaverse is the next evolution of social connection.
[01:19:44.755 --> 01:19:59.606]  He says, well, David Auerbach, an American author and former Microsoft and Google software engineer, posits in an essay published in UnHerd that a user's individuality will only suffer further in the metaverse.
[01:20:00.286 --> 01:20:11.995]  Aubert Auerbach predicts that the virtual space will foster an environment of group uniformity that will put the melting pot tendencies of the last century to shame.
[01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:19.316]  Individuality will be dissolved into a unified mindset of one's chosen monocultures.
[01:20:19.716 --> 01:20:28.725]  Once having joined a stratum, members will naturally play down their differences in favor of their commonalities to the point where they forget those differences, Auerbach writes.
[01:20:29.738 --> 01:20:35.641]  Furthermore, the former engineer believes the users will not only be robbed of their individuality, but their identities will essentially be for sale.
[01:20:36.202 --> 01:20:40.204]  Writing, quote, the result of the metaverse will be the monetization of identity.
[01:20:40.604 --> 01:20:48.148]  The metaverse seeks to make money off of less loaded aspects of identity by fostering intra-group solidarity through purchases.
[01:20:48.168 --> 01:20:51.310]  Yeah, you are a commodity in the future.
[01:20:52.931 --> 01:21:04.522]   He says, he continues, or rather this is Tiernan Ray, former technology editor for Barron's, they're concerned with basic individual autonomy being compromised in the virtual world.
[01:21:05.142 --> 01:21:13.089]  Quote, in a metaverse as conceived by Meta CEO Mark Zuckberg, you cannot even scratch your virtual nose without permission of a program controlled completely by the company.
[01:21:13.929 --> 01:21:20.434]  No one who enters the metaverse of any kind, enters into a metaverse of any kind, has any autonomy.
[01:21:20.954 --> 01:21:28.139]  Their every move is at the discretion of the digital controls of corporations such as Meta that reserve the right to refuse freedom of movement to anyone.
[01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:36.873]  What you really need to understand when you're hearing things like this is that this is not a problem that the metaverse has to try to overcome.
[01:21:37.333 --> 01:21:39.094]  This is the point of the metaverse.
[01:21:39.874 --> 01:21:42.876]  This is the ultimate goal that they are trying to reach.
[01:21:42.916 --> 01:21:47.718]  It's not some sort of issue that they need to work out and something that they need to confront.
[01:21:47.738 --> 01:21:47.978]  No, no.
[01:21:48.217 --> 01:21:53.856]   The metaverse is impossible without this aspect and the implementation of the metaverse is
[01:21:53.856 --> 01:21:55.997]  contingent on this aspect.
[01:21:55.997 --> 01:22:01.457]   The fact that you will not be able to do anything, own anything, say anything without the express
[01:22:01.457 --> 01:22:04.177]  approval of your corporate overlords.
[01:22:04.177 --> 01:22:08.617]   That's the point of the metaverse and that's the point of the Great Reset.
[01:22:08.617 --> 01:22:11.537]  It's not a flaw, it's baked into the code.
[01:22:11.537 --> 01:22:12.697]  It's the reason they're doing it.
[01:22:12.697 --> 01:22:18.297]   If you think it's the metaverse where this problem is worse, just understand that this
[01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:22.617]   is the Great Reset New World Order paradigm that they're trying to implement in real life
[01:22:22.617 --> 01:22:32.057]   and they're trying to overlay their own controlled, digital, manufactured, imagined world on top
[01:22:32.057 --> 01:22:34.936]  of the real world so that they have complete control.
[01:22:34.936 --> 01:22:44.936]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:38.321]  I haven't even seen this headline.
[01:22:38.341 --> 01:22:39.942]  Complete control over your every action.
[01:22:39.982 --> 01:22:46.585]  Mark Zuckerberg says meta employees refer to him as the Eye of Sauron, but thinks the nickname comes from a place of love.
[01:22:48.586 --> 01:22:49.407]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:50.127 --> 01:22:52.508]  And Mark Zuckerberg's just like, I love when people call me Satan.
[01:22:52.928 --> 01:22:53.989]  I think it's because they love me.
[01:22:54.909 --> 01:23:03.173]  I love when they refer to me as the embodiment of evil, the ever-watching eye, flaming eye of Satan himself.
[01:23:03.533 --> 01:23:05.214]  I think it's because they like me so much.
[01:23:06.411 --> 01:23:23.644]  And think about the stories that we've covered over and over, and really, again, it's an aspect of their most basic, like, foundational ideology or mindset or whatever you want to call it, that you'd see headline after headline, story after story of people who work at Facebook saying, it's horrible.
[01:23:23.884 --> 01:23:39.160]   You have to pretend to be happy all the time, and if you aren't happy, they will ostracize you, and if you dare to disagree with what they say, they'll fire you or, you know, destroy your life or, You know, kick you out of your friend group, whatever it is.
[01:23:39.241 --> 01:23:45.787]  It's like, it's the same thing that you hear from the people that are quitting Kamala Harris' administration, right?
[01:23:45.807 --> 01:23:46.788]  They're just like, oh, it was awful.
[01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:57.619]  Everybody bullies you all the time, and you're forced to conform to this groupthink, and it's just horrific and brutal, and makes you question your own sanity.
[01:23:59.241 --> 01:24:00.342]  I'm not even going to read that headline.
[01:24:01.073 --> 01:24:01.914]  I'm not going to say it.
[01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:03.235]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[01:24:03.915 --> 01:24:07.317]  But again, there's something sick about these people.
[01:24:07.858 --> 01:24:13.301]  There's something deep, deep-seated in their soul that is vicious.
[01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:23.688]  And it uses very simple methods of control in the same way, like they're the same methods, we've talked about this many times, same methods that an abusive husband will use to control his wife.
[01:24:24.408 --> 01:24:26.450]  It's the same levers being pulled.
[01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:37.692]   It's the same very simplistic You know, psychological prerogatives that are being exploited just in this case on a global scale or national scale rather than an individual scale.
[01:24:39.595 --> 01:24:42.760]  And it's not an out, you know, Facebook's not an outlier in this regard.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.663]  Disney's experiencing it as well, aren't they?
[01:24:46.189 --> 01:25:01.713]  With the Disney Corporation supporting transgender children, not just supporting, but creating, fostering, establishing, through their propaganda, they want more children to be just utterly confused about the most basic reality.
[01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:17.998]   And you have people that work at Disney, in fact, There's videos being spread around now because it's Disney employees protesting their own company and saying it's incredibly hard to be a conservative that works at Disney because they force you to go along with their agenda.
[01:25:19.332 --> 01:25:33.059]  And in the great reset stakeholder capitalism paradigm that's pushed by Klaus Schwab, corporations have an outsized influence because of the amount of money and capital they control and because they can dictate to their employees what they're allowed to believe.
[01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:36.500]  Not fully, not 100%, but if you want to keep your job.
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.662]  If you don't want to be fired, then you better conform.
[01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:44.024]  You better push our agenda and you better act like you enjoy it.
[01:25:46.601 --> 01:25:48.742]  And so that's what they're doing in Florida.
[01:25:48.882 --> 01:25:50.163]  And it's not really working there.
[01:25:50.183 --> 01:25:55.385]  I know I had a caller the other day that was saying, well, you know, you look at what Disney's trying to do.
[01:25:55.405 --> 01:25:58.507]  They're trying to force, I don't know, maybe it was the debate I was doing.
[01:25:58.527 --> 01:25:59.287]  I can't even remember.
[01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.808]  But they're saying it didn't work.
[01:26:01.408 --> 01:26:03.569]  It didn't work because Florida still passed the bill.
[01:26:04.710 --> 01:26:06.871]  Okay, but they're still doing it.
[01:26:07.811 --> 01:26:09.192]  And it still works in other places.
[01:26:09.212 --> 01:26:19.348]   You know, Salesforce threatened to leave Idaho, I believe it was, unless they scrapped a Bill that had to do with homosexuality.
[01:26:19.368 --> 01:26:21.969]  I don't remember what it was, but it passed through the legislature.
[01:26:22.830 --> 01:26:31.375]  It had been approved of by the representatives of the people, whose will was expressed by their electoral choice of these people to go make this law.
[01:26:31.715 --> 01:27:00.628]   But all of that got overridden, and the governor vetoed it because Salesforce, run by Mark Benioff, who is the understudy of Klaus Schwab, sort of the next in line for the crown of the World Economic Forum, and a very prominent proponent of the stakeholder capitalism agenda, used their corporate weight to force the people of Idaho to comport to their ideology rather than the other way around.
[01:27:01.462 --> 01:27:15.706]  So this is what they do, this is what their design is, and whether you're in the metaverse, or whether you're in the world controlled by the same people that run the metaverse, your every action, your every purchase, your every statement will have to conform to their desires.
[01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:29.649]  Regardless of whether they're the minority or the majority, regardless of whether they're right or wrong, regardless of whether they're openly announcing, as the deep state is now, that they're using misinformation to lie to the American people, you still can't question it because they're in charge.
[01:27:31.254 --> 01:27:32.435]  It's really not that complicated.
[01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:36.517]  Here's what is complicated.
[01:27:37.098 --> 01:27:38.659]  The tangled webs they weave!
[01:27:40.871 --> 01:27:47.856]  In this cabal, Disney names Hillary Clinton campaign deputy communications director as lead spokesperson.
[01:27:48.536 --> 01:27:53.199]  The Walt Disney Company has named Christina Shaik as the new lead spokesperson.
[01:27:53.399 --> 01:28:02.525]  The political operative who worked as an aide in the Obama White House and again as deputy communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign will start immediately.
[01:28:03.066 --> 01:28:10.631]  The appointment comes after President Joe Biden tapped Shaik last year to lead the coronavirus vaccination campaign at the Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:17.333]  It's just, I don't know who this woman is, but boy is she involved in a lot of evil stuff.
[01:28:17.994 --> 01:28:25.216]  She's just hopping from evil corporation to evil campaign to evil health organization.
[01:28:25.276 --> 01:28:28.517]  It's just like leapfrog, like evil leapfrog.
[01:28:28.557 --> 01:28:29.558]  Alright, that's going to do it for me.
[01:28:29.658 --> 01:28:32.458]   Royce White on the other side takes over for the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:32.458 --> 01:28:39.257]  [MUSIC]
[01:28:39.257 --> 01:28:44.257]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:56.177]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they, along with many other New World Order operatives, have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[01:28:56.857 --> 01:29:03.798]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit, and they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[01:29:04.278 --> 01:29:08.619]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true, and the globalists want to take us off air.
[01:29:09.534 --> 01:29:14.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of InfoWars right now.
[01:29:15.135 --> 01:29:25.638]  In our 28 years, all InfoWars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and InfoWars flags again.
[01:29:26.038 --> 01:29:28.879]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[01:29:29.279 --> 01:29:32.259]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[01:29:32.579 --> 01:29:37.741]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:29:37.801 --> 01:29:44.801]  They're at cost.
[01:29:45.801 --> 01:29:50.051]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the end for war and say, "I don't know what's going to happen at the end of
[01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:51.801]  this, but you want to fight?"
[01:29:52.563 --> 01:29:54.726]  You better believe you got one!
[01:29:56.668 --> 01:30:02.668]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:30:02.668 --> 01:30:15.668]  [Music]
[01:30:15.668 --> 01:30:21.668]  [Music]
[01:30:21.668 --> 01:30:23.668]  Everyone is asking, "What can I do?"
[01:30:23.694 --> 01:30:24.634]  You can do two things.
[01:30:26.175 --> 01:30:28.516]  Control your own and your teenagers' showers.
[01:30:29.317 --> 01:30:31.778]  And when you turn off the water, you say, take that, Putin.
[01:30:31.998 --> 01:30:35.339]  Putin isn't the one deploding our borders, having drag queen story time.
[01:30:35.619 --> 01:30:37.140]  Putin's not the one shipping fentanyl in here.
[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.061]  Putin's not the one devaluing our dollar.
[01:30:39.281 --> 01:30:41.422]  Putin's not the one shutting down the Keystone Pipeline.
[01:30:41.662 --> 01:30:47.325]  Putin's invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world.
[01:30:48.237 --> 01:30:56.931]  To help deal with that, yesterday I authorized the release of one million barrels per day for the next six months from our strategic patrolling reserve.
[01:30:57.131 --> 01:31:01.257]  Goldman Sachs out with a no calling the coordinated oil reserves released by the U.S.
[01:31:01.277 --> 01:31:03.321]  and other nations a drop in the ocean.
[01:31:03.701 --> 01:31:06.263]  Even if all of the oil we use in the U.S.A.
[01:31:06.303 --> 01:31:22.437]  were made in the U.S.A., the price of it is still subject to powers and dynamics outside of the U.S.A., which means that until we achieve a form of energy independence that is based on clean energy created here at home, American citizens will still be vulnerable to wild price hikes.
[01:31:22.457 --> 01:31:23.938]  Who's not the one trying to take your guns?
[01:31:24.218 --> 01:31:32.225]  Those who say the blood of, the blood of patriots, you know, and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move against the government.
[01:31:32.905 --> 01:31:35.788]  Well, the tree of liberty is not water in the blood of patriots.
[01:31:35.828 --> 01:31:45.579]  What's happened is that there have never been, if you wanted to think you need to have weapons to take on the government, you need F-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons.
[01:31:45.799 --> 01:31:47.341]  No, it's the new world order.
[01:31:47.401 --> 01:31:59.232]   The affirmative task we have now is to actually Well, everyone is talking about a new world order.
[01:31:59.493 --> 01:32:00.393]  What does that even mean?
[01:32:00.654 --> 01:32:02.395]  What will the new world order look like?
[01:32:02.616 --> 01:32:03.556]  Who will control it?
[01:32:03.997 --> 01:32:11.304]  What has been touted as a right-wing conspiracy theory for the past few decades is now just loosely falling out of the mouths of global leaders everywhere.
[01:32:11.864 --> 01:32:22.507]  But before we get to the various world leaders touting a New World Order, including Biden, Putin, Xi Jinping, the World Economic Forum, and others, let's talk about the people claiming it's a big conspiracy theory.
[01:32:23.188 --> 01:32:30.630]  The Anti-Defamation League categorizes the phrase New World Order under extremism, terrorism, and bigotry.
[01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:40.159]  They define it as, quote, a term used to refer to a right-wing conspiracy theory that became popular among anti-government extremists from the 1990s onwards.
[01:32:40.679 --> 01:32:55.053]  New World Order conspiracists believe that a tyrannical socialist one-world conspiracy has already taken over most of the planet and schemes to eliminate the last bastion of freedom, the United States, with the help of collaborators within the government.
[01:32:55.513 --> 01:33:09.689]  Through repressive measures as well as manufactured crises such as terrorist attacks and pandemics, the globalist conspirators seek to eliminate dissent and to disarm Americans so that the New World Order can move in and enslave them.
[01:33:10.530 --> 01:33:15.152]  Everything the radical left touches turns into a catastrophic mess.
[01:33:15.872 --> 01:33:18.253]  The likes of which we have never seen before.
[01:33:18.333 --> 01:33:21.634]  To this extent, we have never seen anything like it before.
[01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:26.555]  Biden and the Congressional Democrats triggered massive inflation.
[01:33:27.175 --> 01:33:29.956]  They declared war on American energy.
[01:33:30.677 --> 01:33:37.179]  And the middle class is now being crushed by the highest gas and food prices in the history of our country.
[01:33:37.219 --> 01:33:37.959]  Can you believe it?
[01:33:38.639 --> 01:33:44.522]  And I'm deeply proud of the work she's doing as First Lady with Joining Forces Initiative.
[01:33:44.803 --> 01:33:49.145]  She started with Michelle Obama when she was Vice President and now carries on.
[01:33:49.225 --> 01:33:55.509]  People really, really get that this guy is a mega, massive disaster.
[01:33:56.309 --> 01:34:01.113]  Now, the globalists wanted him to be in there to take the blame for their Build Back Better, collapse civilization.
[01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:03.135]  You've got to collapse civilization to Build Back Better.
[01:34:03.155 --> 01:34:11.961]  So when you hear Build Back Better, that means collapse, enslave you, cut your resources off, make you dependent on the system for depopulation efforts that come in the next phase.
[01:34:12.742 --> 01:34:17.443]  But he's so bad that it's really even hurt the New World Order now.
[01:34:18.444 --> 01:34:23.505]  As usual, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[01:34:23.525 --> 01:34:28.486]  The trajectory, where we're going, everything that's been set in motion, nobody can turn it around.
[01:34:28.346 --> 01:34:30.785]  Not the new world order, not us, only God.
[01:34:30.785 --> 01:34:37.785]  [Music]
[01:34:37.785 --> 01:34:41.785]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:34:41.989 --> 01:34:43.630]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:34:44.031 --> 01:34:49.696]  The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:34:50.077 --> 01:34:51.298]  Forget the politicians.
[01:34:51.518 --> 01:34:54.782]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:34:56.357 --> 01:34:56.777]  You don't.
[01:34:57.598 --> 01:34:58.579]  You have no choice.
[01:34:58.939 --> 01:34:59.900]  You have owners.
[01:35:00.181 --> 01:35:01.202]  They own you.
[01:35:02.463 --> 01:35:03.744]  They own everything.
[01:35:03.764 --> 01:35:05.666]  They own all the important land.
[01:35:05.986 --> 01:35:07.748]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:35:07.768 --> 01:35:11.231]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[01:35:11.251 --> 01:35:12.832]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:35:13.172 --> 01:35:17.977]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:35:18.197 --> 01:35:19.839]  They got you by the balls.
[01:35:21.275 --> 01:35:23.317]  They want obedient workers.
[01:35:23.757 --> 01:35:25.299]  Obedient workers.
[01:35:25.639 --> 01:35:38.331]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:35:38.351 --> 01:35:44.737]  And now, they're coming for your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:35:46.172 --> 01:35:48.813]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[01:35:49.113 --> 01:35:54.455]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[01:35:54.775 --> 01:35:55.696]  You better believe it.
[01:35:55.776 --> 01:35:57.676]  So what specifically did they do?
[01:35:58.097 --> 01:36:03.279]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[01:36:03.479 --> 01:36:04.099]  A lot of money.
[01:36:04.699 --> 01:36:07.480]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.721]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:36:10.341 --> 01:36:14.063]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:16.964]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:36:17.344 --> 01:36:20.827]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:36:20.847 --> 01:36:24.770]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:25.771]  They're not interested in that.
[01:36:26.031 --> 01:36:27.032]  That doesn't help them.
[01:36:27.352 --> 01:36:28.433]  That's against their interest.
[01:36:28.533 --> 01:36:29.654]  That's right.
[01:36:29.713 --> 01:36:34.713]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:34.713 --> 01:36:49.713]  So I'm rolling, I'll be ready.
[01:36:49.713 --> 01:36:52.713]   Well, can you tell us at all what you're talking about in there?
[01:36:52.713 --> 01:36:55.713]  We can't get into what's happening in the Deaf...
[01:36:55.713 --> 01:37:01.384]   We can't get into what's happening inside there because right now they've marked the deposition as confidential and
[01:37:01.384 --> 01:37:04.713]  so have we, but I can tell you why I'm here.
[01:37:04.688 --> 01:37:16.134]   I'm here because there is a war against the First Amendment and the Democratic Party and others are trying to use The Sandy Hook tragedy as a pretext to not just erase my first amendment, but all America's first amendment.
[01:37:16.154 --> 01:37:17.535]  This is all about cancel culture.
[01:37:17.795 --> 01:37:18.895]  This is all about censorship.
[01:37:18.915 --> 01:37:23.018]  It's about the dying corporate media wanting to demonize the independent media.
[01:37:23.138 --> 01:37:24.159]  I've certainly made mistakes.
[01:37:24.179 --> 01:37:24.899]  I'm not perfect.
[01:37:24.919 --> 01:37:25.880]  I apologize for those.
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:31.225]  But the mainstream media lied about WMDs in Iraq, lied about so many things.
[01:37:31.265 --> 01:37:33.227]  Jussie Smollett got caught lying.
[01:37:33.327 --> 01:37:39.994]  We have thousands of cases of governments, organizations, corporations, individuals staging events.
[01:37:40.094 --> 01:37:45.260]  And so Americans ask questions about all events, and we have a right to do that under the First Amendment.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.363]  The power structure doesn't want people to be able to ask questions.
[01:37:48.843 --> 01:37:50.024]  I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:51.225]  I'm sorry for the families.
[01:37:51.685 --> 01:37:59.511]  But they're being used, in my view, as pawns by powerful Democrat law firms that want to try to shut down InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:37:59.531 --> 01:38:02.393]  And once that domino falls, they'll be able to shut down everybody.
[01:38:02.673 --> 01:38:08.157]  People don't even remember Adam Lenz's name, the crazed teenager that went and killed those poor children and others.
[01:38:08.478 --> 01:38:11.880]  They think about Alex Jones when they hear about the dead children.
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.441]  How is that?
[01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:14.202]  That's media brainwashing.
[01:38:14.562 --> 01:38:21.530]  That's a system that wants to shut down its competition, taking a few things somebody said out of context, and then setting them up as a villain.
[01:38:21.610 --> 01:38:28.777]  I'm not a villain, and I'm here to stand up for the First Amendment of all Americans to question anything they wish.
[01:38:28.837 --> 01:38:30.759]  That is what this country is all about.
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:36.125]  So Alex, just so I'm clear, you are walking back what you first said about Sandy Hook being a hoax?
[01:38:37.146 --> 01:38:40.449]  I walked back what I said about Sandy Hook years and years and years ago.
[01:38:40.749 --> 01:38:45.253]  The corporate media has never really let my quotes about that or my apologies get out.
[01:38:45.553 --> 01:38:50.037]  They keep misrepresenting that I'm currently denying it happened or I'm attacking the families.
[01:38:50.257 --> 01:38:51.358]  None of that happened.
[01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:55.161]  I did question some of the anomalies, but I learned those anomalies were not correct.
[01:38:55.341 --> 01:38:56.482]  I corrected myself.
[01:38:56.962 --> 01:39:00.185]  Even at the time of Megyn Kelly years ago, I said I believe it happened.
[01:39:00.645 --> 01:39:02.327]  They edited that out of the interview.
[01:39:02.587 --> 01:39:03.628]  I hope you don't do that here.
[01:39:06.116 --> 01:39:06.678]  Thank you.
[01:39:06.738 --> 01:39:07.680]  Thank you so much for talking to me.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.121]  God bless.
[01:39:08.161 --> 01:39:08.662]  Thank you.
[01:39:09.503 --> 01:39:09.944]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:39:09.984 --> 01:39:12.850]  Can you just talk to us so far about how today passed on?
[01:39:14.096 --> 01:39:21.103]  You know, I'm not going to get into the details of the deposition because I know the judge earlier on has said don't release part of the deposition.
[01:39:21.683 --> 01:39:24.285]  Now, I know that Koskoff is saying now they want to release his depositions.
[01:39:24.305 --> 01:39:26.948]  They want to keep their depositions secret, but put mine out.
[01:39:26.968 --> 01:39:29.010]  That's what they've done this whole time.
[01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:30.331]  I'm being railroaded.
[01:39:31.172 --> 01:39:34.375]  I've been defaulted, they say, for not giving them documents or falsifying documents.
[01:39:34.775 --> 01:39:38.358]  But they have all the documents and are saying they're real in my deposition.
[01:39:39.199 --> 01:39:40.681]  So I know the judge has lied.
[01:39:41.481 --> 01:39:47.287]  I know that we gave them all the real documents, and she decided to say that we're guilty of a crime and gave her fake documents.
[01:39:47.867 --> 01:39:50.730]  On my four-and-a-half-year-old daughter, we did not give them fake documents.
[01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:52.571]  That'd be struck down by lightning.
[01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:57.236]  So they have all demonized me, they have decided I can be destroyed, and I'm being railroaded.
[01:39:58.036 --> 01:39:59.436]  I am having my rights destroyed.
[01:39:59.476 --> 01:40:03.598]  I've had my Eighth Amendment destroyed with huge fines that are cruel and unusual.
[01:40:04.538 --> 01:40:06.858]  They changed their deposition times eight times with us.
[01:40:06.939 --> 01:40:09.839]  I've already been deposed three times in Sandy Hook in another case.
[01:40:09.999 --> 01:40:11.100]  I've not hidden from any of this.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:12.260]  Boom!
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:15.201]  I get sick last week with a sinus infection and stuff, had vertigo.
[01:40:16.141 --> 01:40:17.122]  Instant fines, $25,000 a day.
[01:40:17.242 --> 01:40:20.084]  Get up here to Connecticut, you can do it right now.
[01:40:20.124 --> 01:40:20.644]  You're a criminal.
[01:40:21.105 --> 01:40:21.945]  No, I'm not a criminal.
[01:40:22.305 --> 01:40:23.866]  I didn't kill the children at Sandy Hook.
[01:40:24.567 --> 01:40:25.368]  Adam Lanza did.
[01:40:25.608 --> 01:40:31.352]  But everyone knows Alex Jones is connected to Sandy Hook now because they're using it as a way to demonize the First Amendment.
[01:40:31.712 --> 01:40:34.414]  We have seen Jussie Smollett stage his racial attack.
[01:40:34.714 --> 01:40:36.475]  We've seen WMDs in Iraq being faked.
[01:40:36.735 --> 01:40:38.337]  We've seen the Gulf of Tonkin being faked.
[01:40:38.697 --> 01:40:44.481]  We have seen so many examples of things being staged that we have a right to challenge events that have anomalies.
[01:40:44.881 --> 01:40:46.763]  Years ago, I said, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:40:47.684 --> 01:40:53.789]  And that's when they sued me and have come after me because I got so famous, they've attached me to Sandy Hook, claiming I became famous from Sandy Hook.
[01:40:53.929 --> 01:40:56.891]  No, I became famous being a talk show host for 28 years.
[01:40:57.412 --> 01:41:04.258]  And my show exploded under Obama because when you have a Democrat in office, conservative talk radio gets bigger.
[01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:07.701]  When you have a Republican in office, Democrats get bigger.
[01:41:08.002 --> 01:41:12.847]  That's why CNN and MSNBC got so huge under Trump.
[01:41:13.127 --> 01:41:14.889]  And then as soon as he left, the ratings plunged.
[01:41:14.929 --> 01:41:16.651]  Now let me ask this about- I'm about to explain.
[01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:22.558]  They're saying I built my news operation off Sandy Hook that was less than 1% of what we covered over the years.
[01:41:23.058 --> 01:41:25.260]   Not even 1.5% It's a lie.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.001]  So that part's a lie.
[01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:31.263]  It's not about whether I question whether the children died or not or talked about anomalies.
[01:41:31.543 --> 01:41:35.704]  It's that they lie and say that I didn't give them documents and I falsified reports.
[01:41:36.365 --> 01:41:40.766]  Then that judge should go to the federal government or to an agency and call for my indictment.
[01:41:41.126 --> 01:41:44.588]  If we falsified financial reports, then they should be able to indict me.
[01:41:45.208 --> 01:41:47.230]  But no, she's a liar and they're a liar.
[01:41:47.770 --> 01:41:49.931]  And our freedoms are being trampled and destroyed.
[01:41:49.951 --> 01:41:51.733]  They have all my documents, they have everything.
[01:41:52.253 --> 01:41:56.036]  No one in a defamation case, I'm told, has ever turned over this much stuff.
[01:41:56.256 --> 01:41:58.157]  And they say I've given them nothing or it's fake.
[01:41:58.698 --> 01:42:01.099]  And that is totally, absolutely not true.
[01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.901]  And so, they knew that I couldn't have a fair trial.
[01:42:04.222 --> 01:42:09.786]  So they've tried me in the press, they've demonized me, they've said I'm a fraud, they've said I'm a liar, they say I gave them fake documents.
[01:42:10.446 --> 01:42:11.227]  They did all this.
[01:42:11.867 --> 01:42:15.548]  I questioned whether Sandy Hook was fake years ago, and I'm supposedly the worst guy on earth.
[01:42:15.848 --> 01:42:18.509]  Now they, with no evidence, say I gave them false financial records.
[01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:23.431]  It's totally insane what has happened here in this country.
[01:42:23.451 --> 01:42:24.671]  So I didn't kill the children.
[01:42:25.011 --> 01:42:25.772]  Adam Lanza did.
[01:42:25.912 --> 01:42:27.112]  I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:42:27.512 --> 01:42:35.275]  But I'm being used to be demonized so that they can go and censor alternative media because the mainstream corporate media is dying, and they want to be able to shut us down.
[01:42:35.495 --> 01:42:41.022]  So, the family is claiming that they've been getting hate messages from some of your followers based off of what you said.
[01:42:41.062 --> 01:42:41.903]  What is your message?
[01:42:41.943 --> 01:42:43.044]  What do you have to say about that?
[01:42:43.264 --> 01:42:46.989]  Well, somebody could start sending you guys hate messages in somebody else's name.
[01:42:47.289 --> 01:42:49.292]  Or somebody could send hate messages in your name.
[01:42:49.312 --> 01:42:50.553]  Does that mean you could take it off the air?
[01:42:51.034 --> 01:42:53.537]  That idea that they claim some people harassed them...
[01:42:53.957 --> 01:42:57.859]  With no real evidence of that, and now I'm going to be taken off the air, which is basically their goal.
[01:42:58.499 --> 01:42:59.899]  Look, most of the families didn't sue me.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.680]  And those that did, I understand, have had a lot of pain.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.601]  But attacking me won't bring their children back.
[01:43:04.341 --> 01:43:10.204]  And claiming that my free speech is hurting them and misrepresenting what I've said is not going to bring their children back.
[01:43:10.504 --> 01:43:10.764]  Okay?
[01:43:11.064 --> 01:43:13.765]  And so they're using this to get rid of the First Amendment.
[01:43:14.205 --> 01:43:22.553]  Everybody's right to free speech and to question things like WMDs in Iraq, or Operation Northwoods, or the Gulf of Tonkin, or Jussie Smollett.
[01:43:22.714 --> 01:43:24.755]  I said Jussie Smollett was fake the day after it happened.
[01:43:24.956 --> 01:43:26.037]  Didn't buy it.
[01:43:26.097 --> 01:43:26.838]  And I was right.
[01:43:27.178 --> 01:43:28.559]  So I'm right more than I'm wrong.
[01:43:28.659 --> 01:43:29.560]  Sometimes I'm wrong.
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:32.463]  And I said years ago, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[01:43:32.863 --> 01:43:36.187]  And they've made a huge deal about questioning narratives.
[01:43:36.447 --> 01:43:37.328]  That's what's happening.
[01:43:37.348 --> 01:43:38.609]  So I have to get back in this deposition.
[01:43:38.749 --> 01:43:42.012]  What do you have to say to your followers who still believe that Sandy Hook is a hoax?
[01:43:42.212 --> 01:43:47.716]  Well, when people say, your followers believe Sandy Hook's a hoax, the internet didn't believe it day one it happened.
[01:43:47.756 --> 01:43:49.217]  We covered the internet not believing it.
[01:43:49.718 --> 01:44:00.306]  So, people not trusting the mainstream media and the government is the government and the mainstream media's fault being caught lying so much no one questions, no one basically believes what they have to say anymore.
[01:44:00.627 --> 01:44:04.990]  Okay, so just because the corporate media is discredited doesn't mean that's Alex Jones' fault.
[01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:06.151]  It's the corporate media's fault.
[01:44:06.191 --> 01:44:06.771]  Good talking to you.
[01:44:06.612 --> 01:44:07.612]  Thank you.
[01:44:07.612 --> 01:44:29.612]  [Music]
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:30.562]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:44:30.863 --> 01:44:31.344]  Today.
[01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:35.613]  It's called the Great Reset.
[01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:36.775]  Tough guy.
[01:44:38.078 --> 01:44:39.139]  It's called the New World Order.
[01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:49.186]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[01:44:49.246 --> 01:44:50.307]  That's everything.
[01:44:50.587 --> 01:44:52.408]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[01:44:52.689 --> 01:44:57.952]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[01:44:57.972 --> 01:44:59.493]  It's all being officially announced.
[01:44:59.513 --> 01:45:00.915]  I've got articles everywhere.
[01:45:00.975 --> 01:45:03.236]  There are press releases saying it!
[01:45:06.818 --> 01:45:09.722]  And the crew asked me during the break, they go, Are you alright?
[01:45:09.762 --> 01:45:10.843]  You really seem upset here.
[01:45:10.963 --> 01:45:12.004]  Are you feeling okay?
[01:45:12.104 --> 01:45:13.846]  Well, they're about to have to go to war.
[01:45:13.866 --> 01:45:16.089]  I mean, they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[01:45:16.209 --> 01:45:17.511]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out, yeah.
[01:45:17.551 --> 01:45:18.392]  But this is real.
[01:45:18.452 --> 01:45:22.452]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[01:45:22.452 --> 01:45:25.452]  I don't understand.
[01:45:25.452 --> 01:45:28.452]   I'm not a little bit mad, but I'm not getting into that game.
[01:45:28.452 --> 01:45:32.452]  People are always trying to be like, "What the hell is this?"
[01:45:32.562 --> 01:45:35.083]  You know, you never see it on the news.
[01:45:35.243 --> 01:45:36.364]  They're dying right now.
[01:45:36.524 --> 01:45:49.529]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[01:45:50.009 --> 01:45:51.349]  And that paralyzes God.
[01:45:51.409 --> 01:45:52.490]  Yeah, God can do it.
[01:45:53.929 --> 01:46:02.297]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true.
[01:46:02.317 --> 01:46:02.938]  I'm upset.
[01:46:03.098 --> 01:46:04.359]  I'm really upset.
[01:46:04.559 --> 01:46:07.062]  I told you last night, what's wrong with you?
[01:46:07.162 --> 01:46:08.343]  I'm really freaked out.
[01:46:11.426 --> 01:46:12.587]  I'm really freaked out.
[01:46:12.627 --> 01:46:13.868]  You see, because this is real.
[01:46:13.948 --> 01:46:18.412]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real.
[01:46:21.457 --> 01:46:26.280]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:35.747]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist... I mean... We won't be here in six months.
[01:46:35.767 --> 01:46:42.672]  You won't be here in six months.
[01:46:42.812 --> 01:46:45.814]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[01:46:45.915 --> 01:46:47.836]  InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:46:47.936 --> 01:46:50.816]   InfoWars.com InfoWars.
[01:46:50.856 --> 01:46:51.817]  You watch InfoWars?
[01:46:52.017 --> 01:46:52.878]  InfoWars.
[01:46:52.898 --> 01:46:55.160]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:55.940]  Alex Jones.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:56.501]  Nice guy.
[01:46:56.541 --> 01:46:59.063]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:46:59.263 --> 01:46:59.884]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:01.565 --> 01:47:02.266]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:02.366 --> 01:47:03.006]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:03.107 --> 01:47:04.308]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[01:47:04.388 --> 01:47:05.489]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[01:47:05.569 --> 01:47:06.610]  I'm playing this joke over here.
[01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:08.131]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[01:47:08.291 --> 01:47:11.634]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:47:11.514 --> 01:47:18.514]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:47:18.953 --> 01:47:24.432]   Henry Kissinger, Klaus Schwab, the whole globalist system that they've inherited from the Rockefellers
[01:47:24.432 --> 01:47:27.033]  and the Rothschilds think they're God, but they're not God.
[01:47:27.651 --> 01:47:34.033]  They didn't create this planet, they didn't create the sun, they didn't create the universe, they didn't create the trillions and trillions of galaxies that we know exist.
[01:47:35.113 --> 01:47:38.374]  They can't even comprehend God or how to be just good people.
[01:47:38.515 --> 01:47:49.699]  All they are is selfish demons that seek to take control of your lives, who seek to harness humanity and convince us that they are superior to us and that we have to serve them and their ideas.
[01:47:50.119 --> 01:47:54.021]  They want control of our bodies with their nanotech, with their genetic engineering.
[01:47:54.261 --> 01:48:03.405]  They want us to accept the fact that they can put in our bodies what they want, when they want, and then lie to us about the fact they call it a vaccine when it is gene therapy.
[01:48:04.105 --> 01:48:06.186]  This is all about their quest for eternal life.
[01:48:06.666 --> 01:48:17.430]  They are testing on the general public, trying to find compounds from toxic experiments that give them what they call the Lazarus gene and other systems they're searching for.
[01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:22.151]  It all started in the 1950s when they discovered immortal cell lines.
[01:48:22.652 --> 01:48:25.513]  Cells that never die and replicate forever.
[01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.954]  We call it, of course, the more vicious types.
[01:48:29.708 --> 01:48:36.708]   of cancer. But through death and through mass experimentation against the general population,
[01:48:36.708 --> 01:48:41.387]   they believe they will find the keys to immortality. So as you see the beauty of the universe that
[01:48:41.387 --> 01:48:47.387]   God gave us, realize the globalists are not God. The globalists are simply parasites who
[01:48:47.387 --> 01:48:52.587]   are selfishly trying to take control of your life in a hope of artificially building immortality
[01:48:52.587 --> 01:48:53.469]  for themselves.
[01:48:53.803 --> 01:49:02.169]  When immortality has been given to us by God through our consciousness, if we choose to be with God and not serve ourselves and be selfish entities.
[01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:03.390]  And that's the truth.
[01:49:03.630 --> 01:49:05.452]  And that's what M4 War stands for.
[01:49:05.712 --> 01:49:15.521]  It's getting you to think for yourself and to get outside the box and realize that God created the universe for us to have communion with God, not for us to pretend that we are God.
[01:49:15.861 --> 01:49:18.383]  Those that try to do that, they have a name for them.
[01:49:18.403 --> 01:49:19.504]  They're called Satanists.
[01:49:19.725 --> 01:49:23.788]  They believe that Lucifer could be his own God, just as they could be their own God.
[01:49:24.049 --> 01:49:29.464]   Just as in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible, Satan says to Eve, You can be a God.
[01:49:30.084 --> 01:49:31.585]  As she goes at him and says, you can be a God.
[01:49:31.805 --> 01:49:35.087]  Just eat up this tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[01:49:35.167 --> 01:49:36.728]  The knowledge of evil.
[01:49:36.828 --> 01:49:38.289]  We were perfect and innocent.
[01:49:38.309 --> 01:49:39.750]  We had only the knowledge of good.
[01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:45.633]  Knowledge of evil is how to manipulate, how to twist, how to set up corrupt criminal systems, how to play God.
[01:49:46.874 --> 01:49:50.897]  As it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Man.
[01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:53.078]  And we're entering those days now.
[01:49:53.098 --> 01:49:54.059]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:54.299 --> 01:49:55.219]  This is InfoHorse.
[01:49:55.079 --> 01:49:57.079]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[01:49:57.079 --> 01:49:59.079]  [applause]
[01:49:59.079 --> 01:50:06.079]  [music]
[01:50:06.079 --> 01:50:08.079]  Hello Americans, I'm Paul Harvey.
[01:50:07.852 --> 01:50:10.716]  If I were the devil.
[01:50:10.736 --> 01:50:14.381]  If I were the prince of darkness, I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness.
[01:50:14.662 --> 01:50:18.207]  And I'd have a third of its real estate and four-fifths of its population.
[01:50:18.247 --> 01:50:21.351]  But I wouldn't be happy until I had seized the ripest apple on the tree.
[01:50:24.408 --> 01:50:27.450]  So I've set about however necessary to take over the United States.
[01:50:27.531 --> 01:50:31.014]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[01:50:31.374 --> 01:50:32.695]  I'd subvert the churches first.
[01:50:32.795 --> 01:50:34.617]  I'd begin with a campaign of whispers.
[01:50:34.957 --> 01:50:38.200]  With the wisdom of a serpent, I would whisper to you as I whispered to Eve.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:39.561]  Do as you please.
[01:50:39.801 --> 01:50:41.903]  To the young, I would whisper that the Bible is a myth.
[01:50:42.364 --> 01:50:45.847]  I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way around.
[01:50:46.087 --> 01:50:49.371]   I would confide that what What's bad is good and what's good is square.
[01:50:49.612 --> 01:50:52.876]  And the old I would teach to pray after me.
[01:50:53.437 --> 01:50:55.681]  Our father, which art in Washington.
[01:50:56.659 --> 01:50:57.800]  And then I'd get organized.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:03.862]  I'd educate authors in how to make lurid literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting.
[01:51:03.942 --> 01:51:07.063]  I'd threaten TV with dirtier movies and vice versa.
[01:51:07.363 --> 01:51:09.084]  I'd peddle narcotics to whom I could.
[01:51:09.124 --> 01:51:12.145]  I'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction.
[01:51:12.405 --> 01:51:15.826]  I'd tranquilize the rest with pills.
[01:51:15.906 --> 01:51:21.847]   If I were the devil, I'd soon have families that themselves, churches at war with themselves, and nations at
[01:51:21.847 --> 01:51:27.957]   war with themselves, until each in its turn was consumed. And with promises of higher
[01:51:27.957 --> 01:51:32.186]   ratings, I'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flames.
[01:51:32.186 --> 01:51:35.186]  The president of the United States is racist.
[01:51:35.186 --> 01:51:39.686]   If I were the devil, I would encourage schools to refine young intellects, but neglect the
[01:51:39.686 --> 01:51:44.686]   discipline of emotions just let those run wild. Within a decade, I'd have prisons overflowing,
[01:51:44.686 --> 01:51:49.686]   I'd have judges promoting pornography, soon I could evict God from the courthouse, then
[01:51:49.686 --> 01:51:52.686]  from the schoolhouse, and then from the houses of Congress.
[01:51:52.686 --> 01:51:57.686]   And in his own churches, I would substitute psychology for religion.
[01:51:57.686 --> 01:52:03.686]   I would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls and church money.
[01:52:03.098 --> 01:52:10.869]  If I were the devil, I'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive of the ambitious.
[01:52:12.603 --> 01:52:14.064]  I would caution against extremes.
[01:52:14.124 --> 01:52:15.044]  I'm here to warn people!
[01:52:15.104 --> 01:52:16.665]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[01:52:16.945 --> 01:52:17.906]  This isn't a game!
[01:52:18.046 --> 01:52:29.451]  In hard work, in patriotism, in moral conduct, I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned, that swinging is more fun, that what you see on TV is the way to be.
[01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:37.075]  And thus I could undress you in public, and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which there is no cure.
[01:52:36.935 --> 01:52:43.935]   In other words, if I were the devil, I'd just keep right on doing what he's doing.
[01:53:00.575 --> 01:53:07.575]  Now you know... the rest of the story.
[01:53:07.575 --> 01:53:14.575]  [Music]
[01:53:14.575 --> 01:53:21.575]  [Music]
[01:53:21.575 --> 01:53:24.334]  (dramatic music)
[01:53:24.719 --> 01:53:25.340]  And we are live.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.282]  It is the Summit News Hour for the 7th of April 2022.
[01:53:28.922 --> 01:53:31.484]  Gonna do a little bit of a longer show today.
[01:53:31.504 --> 01:53:33.745]  Obviously, we're gonna cover the news in the first hour.
[01:53:34.506 --> 01:53:37.308]  Then I've got a guest coming on for the final half hour.
[01:53:37.368 --> 01:53:39.109]  Some of you may have heard him on Monday.
[01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:47.515]  He is Michael de la Brock from Bohanka Watch, the Telegram channel that is closely tracking the propaganda on both sides of the war.
[01:53:47.575 --> 01:53:47.915]  Yes!
[01:53:48.456 --> 01:53:52.158]  Both sides of the war actually engage in propaganda!
[01:53:53.059 --> 01:53:54.100]  You would have never have known it!
[01:53:55.134 --> 01:54:02.820]  On his telegram channel from on-the-ground sources, both pro-Ukraine, pro-Russia, because we have yet another alleged war crime.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.224]  They seem to be coming in bursts of two or three every week at this point.
[01:54:08.024 --> 01:54:16.531]  Of course, we have the claim that Russians had killed a bunch of Ukrainian civilians in Buka, a claim that emerged over the weekend.
[01:54:17.171 --> 01:54:31.054]   Claims and counterclaims, to say the least, regarding that the dead individuals were seen with Wearing white armbands, which would have suggested that they were pro-Russian, so why the Russians would kill them is another guess.
[01:54:31.094 --> 01:54:35.775]  We've had claims of mass graves in that area at least since March the 10th.
[01:54:36.595 --> 01:54:38.996]  Well, now we've got an old favourite that's returned.
[01:54:39.056 --> 01:54:42.337]  I'm not going to get into it in any depth now, because we're going to cover it later with the guests.
[01:54:42.777 --> 01:54:45.658]  But yes, the Russian mobile crematoriums are back.
[01:54:46.408 --> 01:55:02.376]  The eight-year-old YouTube clip of a dumpster crematorium has once again circulated and indeed gone viral on Twitter with zero fact-check whatsoever from the much-vaunted, much-esteemed Ministry of Truth, I mean independent fact-checkers.
[01:55:03.316 --> 01:55:07.198]  And it hasn't added, Twitter hasn't added a label, they haven't done anything.
[01:55:07.838 --> 01:55:17.866]   It's a clip from an eight-year-old YouTube video and they're saying this is proof of Russia burning Civilians in Ukraine.
[01:55:18.086 --> 01:55:20.347]  Once again, absolute tosh!
[01:55:21.487 --> 01:55:31.911]  There's also claims that Russian prisoners of war, in fact the New York Times has verified it apparently, were killed near Bukha by Ukrainian troops.
[01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:35.132]  I'm gonna save all that for the second half of the show though.
[01:55:35.952 --> 01:55:37.593]  Because first I'm gonna get into this.
[01:55:37.673 --> 01:55:44.193]   Of course, Elon Musk acquired 9.1, according to some reports, 9.2% stake In Twitter.
[01:55:44.293 --> 01:55:45.773]  That was announced on Monday.
[01:55:46.614 --> 01:55:50.074]  Next day it was announced that he'd also be sat on the board of Twitter.
[01:55:50.114 --> 01:55:52.795]  Of course, he's now the biggest individual shareholder.
[01:55:53.455 --> 01:55:57.236]  And this has caused absolute bedlam and panic.
[01:55:57.316 --> 01:56:05.277]  I'm going to get the latest updates to you here in a minute, but first let's set the table with this video that I made after the original announcement.
[01:56:05.757 --> 01:56:08.138]  This is called, Feels Like We're Back.
[01:56:07.998 --> 01:56:08.998]  here's the clip.
[01:56:08.998 --> 01:56:13.998]  [music]
[01:56:13.998 --> 01:56:15.998]  Did you ever think you'd see the day?
[01:56:15.846 --> 01:56:19.669]  Elon Musk is now the largest individual shareholder of Twitter.
[01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:22.050]  And today he was appointed to the board of directors.
[01:56:22.211 --> 01:56:22.691]  Yes!
[01:56:23.011 --> 01:56:24.272]  We've got him!
[01:56:24.352 --> 01:56:30.417]  All this just days after Musk said Twitter's failure to uphold free speech fundamentally undermines democracy.
[01:56:30.537 --> 01:56:32.458]  All the right people are fuming.
[01:56:32.579 --> 01:56:37.442]  A prominent transphobe buying a large stake in Twitter is not so funny!
[01:56:37.642 --> 01:56:39.564]  I'm honestly kind of terrified right now.
[01:56:39.684 --> 01:56:45.587]  When imbeciles with preferred pronouns in their bios are big mad, you know it's a good day for the good guys.
[01:56:47.649 --> 01:56:51.571]  Others complained about the impact on the company culture.
[01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:53.972]  Oh no, not the precious company culture.
[01:56:54.032 --> 01:56:54.953]  Culture of what?
[01:56:55.033 --> 01:56:58.655]  Weaponised mobs of angry soy jacks and beard splainers.
[01:56:58.695 --> 01:57:04.058]  Demanding anyone who dares suggest chromosomes exist be publicly humiliated and banned.
[01:57:04.098 --> 01:57:04.838]  Swivel on it.
[01:57:04.919 --> 01:57:05.859]  Bring back Trump.
[01:57:05.859 --> 01:57:07.298]  Make Twitter fun again!
[01:57:07.298 --> 01:57:18.099]  [Heartbeat]
[01:57:18.099 --> 01:57:18.599]  [Whistle]
[01:57:18.599 --> 01:57:21.798]  [Heartbeat]
[01:57:21.798 --> 01:57:29.198]  [Cheering]
[01:57:29.198 --> 01:57:30.398]  Oh my god!
[01:57:30.398 --> 01:57:31.499]  [Laughter]
[01:57:31.499 --> 01:57:32.298]  Look at that!
[01:57:32.298 --> 01:57:33.698]  [Laughter]
[01:57:33.617 --> 01:57:35.056]  Holy smokes, man!
[01:57:35.056 --> 01:57:36.896]  But can Elon save Twitter?
[01:57:36.896 --> 01:57:39.296]  Surely he's up against a wall of opposition.
[01:57:39.296 --> 01:57:42.337]  Maybe, but many of them won't be there for much longer.
[01:57:42.337 --> 01:57:47.536]   Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, the guy who threw free speech under a bus back in 2018.
[01:57:47.536 --> 01:57:49.056]  He's gonna be gone soon.
[01:57:49.056 --> 01:57:55.217]   Jack Dorsey seems to be on the road to achieving some kind of miraculous escape from perdition to penance.
[01:57:55.217 --> 01:58:01.007]   He expressed regret over the weekend for his role in helping giant corporations obtain monopolies over content
[01:58:01.007 --> 01:58:01.697]  and speech.
[01:58:01.697 --> 01:58:04.336]  And then he welcomed Musk joining the board.
[01:58:04.336 --> 01:58:10.096]   Many of the "alphabet people" and other adversaries of free speech will, if Elon sees his control,
[01:58:10.096 --> 01:58:15.376]   be forced to perform their duty of moral exhibitionist seppuku and quit the company.
[01:58:15.588 --> 01:58:18.251]  But the regime won't give up the fight so easily.
[01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:24.477]  A condition of Musk being on the Board of Twitter is that while he's on it, he's prevented from buying more than 14.9% of the company's stock.
[01:58:26.138 --> 01:58:29.720]  That stops him from buying more of the company or the whole thing.
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:36.122]  But his new position will give him huge influence over Twitter's increasingly draconian rules and content policies.
[01:58:36.262 --> 01:58:43.045]  After he asked whether Twitter adhered to free speech, Musk indicated he was giving serious thought to starting a competitor.
[01:58:43.105 --> 01:58:54.330]  According to analysis by Bank of America, quote, if Twitter does not agree to modify its content policies in line with Elon's vision, the Tesla founder could pull the trigger on creating a new competitor.
[01:58:54.410 --> 01:59:00.413]   Not Truth Social or any other of these naff efforts won with teeth and mammoth funding.
[01:59:00.673 --> 01:59:01.994]  Zero hedge summarizers.
[01:59:02.114 --> 01:59:09.098]  One thing is clear, the current management team at Twitter headed by woke CEO Parag Agrawal is as good as gone.
[01:59:09.138 --> 01:59:11.019]  Get woke, go broke in reverse.
[01:59:11.159 --> 01:59:16.942]  The mere prospect of Twitter once again becoming a genuine free speech platform is invigorating.
[01:59:17.082 --> 01:59:21.504]  Rescued from the pearl-clutching grasp of echo chamber blue checkmarks.
[01:59:21.664 --> 01:59:29.487]  Liberated from abuse by cretinous journalists who weaponized it to ruin people's lives and silence ideological opposition.
[01:59:29.587 --> 01:59:42.030]  Freed from the Ministry of Truth fact-checker legacy media industrial complex who sanitized it by banning anyone interesting and ring-fencing permissible Overton windows of discussion.
[01:59:42.191 --> 01:59:46.752]  Emancipated from screeching AstroTurf hashtag activists and the mob.
[01:59:46.872 --> 01:59:53.718]  Who manipulated it to dogpile, publicly shame, tar and feather anyone who dared contradict regime narratives?
[01:59:53.818 --> 01:59:58.683]  To think that all that malignancy will just vanish overnight is pie in the sky.
[01:59:58.763 --> 02:00:00.805]  But there's a real chance of change.
[02:00:00.905 --> 02:00:03.387]  Hang on, isn't this all a Trojan horse?
[02:00:03.487 --> 02:00:08.512]  How could it be that the richest man in the world isn't in fact part of the regime?
[02:00:08.692 --> 02:00:10.334]  It just sounds too good to be true.
[02:00:10.474 --> 02:00:11.315]  Well, it is true.
[02:00:11.655 --> 02:00:12.376]  I can confirm.
[02:00:12.556 --> 02:00:16.881]  With 100% certainty, the Elon Musk is indeed based.
[02:00:17.121 --> 02:00:25.671]  And much to the horror of the woke cretins who have had the run of the social media network for years, Twitter may be about to be based again too.
[02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:27.172]  Feels like we're back, boys.
[02:00:27.493 --> 02:00:28.434]  Feels like we're back!
[02:00:33.052 --> 02:00:35.153]  Now that was two days ago.
[02:00:35.213 --> 02:00:38.415]  There have been several developments since.
[02:00:39.335 --> 02:00:59.727]  First of all, Twitter came out shortly after I released this video with a statement assuring basically their far-left woke managers and employees that they're going to completely disregard the owners of the company itself and the board members and that Elon Musk or anyone else on the board won't play any role in quote policy decisions.
[02:00:59.767 --> 02:01:04.990]   They said Our policy decisions are not determined by the board or shareholders.
[02:01:05.911 --> 02:01:07.592]  I'm sure they have been before, by the way.
[02:01:07.913 --> 02:01:22.786]  In fact, I know for a fact that when Twitter bans any prominent verified individual on Twitter, they have to have a meeting of at least some of the board members to put the rubber stamp on that permanent suspension.
[02:01:22.846 --> 02:01:23.807]  I know that for a fact.
[02:01:25.123 --> 02:01:34.467]  That's been reversed apparently though in this statement it says our policy decisions are not determined by the board or shareholders and we have no plans to reverse any policy decisions which of course...
[02:01:35.555 --> 02:01:37.416]  Mainly applies to President Trump.
[02:01:37.696 --> 02:01:47.359]  There's a big call to make Twitter orange again by bringing back Trump, who, by the way, if you remember, was banned for absolutely no reason whatsoever.
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:58.064]  There was no evidence, there were no tweets of him inciting the January 6 rioters, who now we know from court cases are getting off on the fact that they were allowed into the building.
[02:01:59.044 --> 02:02:01.805]  No reason to ban Trump whatsoever in the first place.
[02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:06.413]  But as to whether he's coming back, they're basically saying no, he's not coming back.
[02:02:06.753 --> 02:02:10.676]  They're basically saying Elon Musk is not going to have any impact on the decisions.
[02:02:10.716 --> 02:02:14.118]  I'm sure Elon has a very different take on that.
[02:02:14.138 --> 02:02:28.529]  So they came out with this mealy-mouthed statement to try and assuage their woke managers and employees and put them back in their box and basically say, don't worry, Twitter is going to continue to be a safe space for far-left radicals and extremists.
[02:02:29.187 --> 02:02:31.508]  The rules which they break on a daily basis.
[02:02:31.888 --> 02:02:34.188]  Of course, when Conservatives break those rules, they get banned.
[02:02:34.228 --> 02:02:34.909]  The Left doesn't.
[02:02:35.309 --> 02:02:40.550]  But we're going to come back in the next segment and tell you the latest on Twitter's woke response.
[02:02:40.590 --> 02:02:41.811]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:02:42.311 --> 02:02:46.592]  So Elon Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter.
[02:02:46.632 --> 02:02:47.992]  He's on the board.
[02:02:48.432 --> 02:02:49.973]  Twitter responded to the panic.
[02:02:50.473 --> 02:03:02.144]  By coming out and saying, don't worry, he's not going to have any influence over policy decisions or basically reversing bans, primarily the ban of President Trump, which was completely unwarranted and unfair.
[02:03:02.704 --> 02:03:08.349]  He was basically railroaded off of all social media simultaneously, much like Alex Jones was back in the day.
[02:03:09.250 --> 02:03:30.966]   So they came out with this mealy-mouthed statement trying to placate the woke mob that now runs Twitter, the blue checkmark pink hair brigade, But the panic continues to seep deep into the managerial strata of Twitter and the employee base because Reuters came out with a headline which I summarised in an article that I wrote.
[02:03:31.886 --> 02:03:36.988]  Twitter insiders panicking Elon Musk will prevent them from censoring content.
[02:03:37.856 --> 02:03:44.981]  Now it goes through a series of accounts of employees and managers that Reuters spoke to in this article that came out today.
[02:03:45.361 --> 02:03:51.565]  And this statement that Twitter put out yesterday has done nothing to dampen their, quote, alarm and fear.
[02:03:52.325 --> 02:03:59.930]  In this article they state, uh, the danger to Twitter is that Musk is a self-proclaimed, quote, free speech absolutist.
[02:04:00.511 --> 02:04:03.733]  Yes, they actually say that as if it's a bad thing.
[02:04:04.631 --> 02:04:20.907]  Says, despite Twitter's reiteration this week that the board does not make policy decisions, four Twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said they were concerned about Musk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive users and harmful content.
[02:04:21.565 --> 02:04:34.635]  In other words, woke snowflakes who have seized control of Twitter and used it as their tool to silence the free speech of dissenters and political adversaries are worried their monopoly and control might be coming to an end.
[02:04:34.995 --> 02:04:54.540]   This is about them losing the power to mass ban, to mass censor prominent users and important content Such as the Hunter Biden laptop story, which was obviously suppressed and censored, not just by Facebook, but by also Twitter, before the election, along with many other real things.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:05:00.482]  Meanwhile, their fact-checker industrial complex only fact-checks one side of the debate.
[02:05:00.882 --> 02:05:08.914]   When you get a flagrant fake news story, like mobile Russian crematoriums in Ukraine, Nothing happens to it whatsoever.
[02:05:08.934 --> 02:05:10.596]  I just looked at that tweet earlier.
[02:05:10.776 --> 02:05:16.621]  There's no warning label on it whatsoever because fact checkers are partisan hacks.
[02:05:17.081 --> 02:05:20.544]  They're just an extension of the same legacy media complex.
[02:05:21.444 --> 02:05:27.209]  So Reuters spoke to these woke employees within Twitter and they're still in all of a tizzy.
[02:05:28.230 --> 02:05:36.805]   Says the employee said his views on moderation Which is basically basic free speech and the rules equally apply to everyone.
[02:05:37.326 --> 02:05:45.073]  Could weaken years-long efforts to make Twitter a place of healthy discourse and might allow trolling and mob attacks to flourish.
[02:05:45.493 --> 02:05:46.414]  Give me a break!
[02:05:46.954 --> 02:05:50.918]  The only mob attacks that are allowed to flourish on Twitter are lead.
[02:05:51.781 --> 02:05:55.283]  By left-wing mobs every single time!
[02:05:55.323 --> 02:05:57.184]  They're allowed to lead mob attacks.
[02:05:57.784 --> 02:06:02.726]  Anyone questions anyone on the other side of the equation, it's like, how dare you?
[02:06:03.086 --> 02:06:08.449]  You saw the Taylor Lorenz clip a few days ago where she's crying because she gets a bit of pushback.
[02:06:08.869 --> 02:06:15.833]  This woman who deliberately weaponized her, quote, journalism to try and ruin the lives of private individuals primarily.
[02:06:18.726 --> 02:06:22.387]  Doxing Pamela Geller's daughters whenever she gets any pushback.
[02:06:22.627 --> 02:06:24.668]  She claims a mass harassment conspiracy.
[02:06:24.988 --> 02:06:26.028]  Cries on television.
[02:06:27.008 --> 02:06:31.409]  But then left-wing mobs on a daily basis do the same thing to people on the right.
[02:06:31.669 --> 02:06:34.010]  Do the same thing to private citizens who share memes.
[02:06:34.710 --> 02:06:35.610]  CNN does it.
[02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:38.491]  They go and visit old ladies for sharing Trump memes.
[02:06:39.131 --> 02:06:42.412]  Oh, that's fine though, because the rules aren't equally applied.
[02:06:43.532 --> 02:06:54.772]   So when they say a place of healthy discourse, That of course means controlling the narrative, controlling what you're allowed to say, banning people who dare suggest that chromosomes exist.
[02:06:55.573 --> 02:07:06.236]  Making it a safe space for far-left activists and radicals who wantonly violate the same rules that have led to Conservatives having their accounts permanently banned.
[02:07:07.436 --> 02:07:12.977]  Mob attacks are also a routine feature of Twitter discourse, with virtually all of them being led by far-left mobs.
[02:07:13.338 --> 02:07:14.618]  It's okay when we do it!
[02:07:16.491 --> 02:07:27.519]  The article continues, it goes on to say that employees are fearful Twitter's insistence that Musk's presence on its board won't lead to more free speech, God forbid, on the platform is hollow.
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:33.864]  One employee told Reuters, quote, I find it hard to believe the board doesn't have influence.
[02:07:34.424 --> 02:07:36.826]  If that's the case, why would Elon want a board seat?
[02:07:37.507 --> 02:07:46.414]   And it's They want the board to have influence because the board is entirely made up of people who are water carriers and amplifiers for their far-left agenda.
[02:07:46.774 --> 02:07:50.415]  It's okay when all the people on the board represent their political interests.
[02:07:50.735 --> 02:07:56.537]  When you get one single person who maybe wants a bit of balance, oh my God, the horror!
[02:07:58.158 --> 02:07:59.658]  Others are concerned.
[02:08:00.299 --> 02:08:03.980]  Musk might push back against Twitter's policy of inclusivity.
[02:08:04.614 --> 02:08:10.618]  Which is seemingly based around transgender activists being empowered to ban people who say men are men.
[02:08:11.979 --> 02:08:25.147]  Then they quote of this guy, Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abulsameed, who told Reuters that Musk could be influential in, yes, making Twitter orange again by restoring Donald Trump's Twitter account.
[02:08:26.008 --> 02:08:32.592]  He said, quote, I wouldn't be surprised if Twitter restores Trump's account now that Elon owns nearly 10% of the company.
[02:08:32.792 --> 02:08:33.793]  Oh my God, the horror.
[02:08:35.003 --> 02:08:43.366]  Again, isn't he still in some weird Facebook limbo where they didn't even properly ban him but just restricted him from having access to the account?
[02:08:43.706 --> 02:08:46.547]  And that's now gone on for a year and three months.
[02:08:47.467 --> 02:08:48.688]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:08:49.208 --> 02:09:09.753]   Based on the complete phony premise that Trump incited, facilitated the January 6th riot, when it was literally facilitated by people letting them into the building, as is now proven in court cases, The Reuters article ends by saying that numerous employees are considering quitting over Elon Musk's involvement.
[02:09:09.893 --> 02:09:10.433]  Oh, no!
[02:09:10.453 --> 02:09:13.934]  Quote, some people are dusting off their resumes.
[02:09:14.014 --> 02:09:17.535]  One person said, I don't want to work for somebody like Musk.
[02:09:18.175 --> 02:09:22.156]  Somebody who values free speech on a public town square platform.
[02:09:22.516 --> 02:09:23.196]  Oh, my God.
[02:09:23.516 --> 02:09:25.137]  The absolute horror of that.
[02:09:25.997 --> 02:09:27.977]  Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
[02:09:28.337 --> 02:09:30.818]  So the more of these idiots that do quit, the better.
[02:09:31.912 --> 02:09:52.277]  The pessimist in me thinks that, you know, Musk is going to get elbowed aside and his influence over trying to make Twitter great again, trying to make it an actual free speech platform, trying to restore accounts of prominent individuals like Trump, like Project Veritas, who were unfairly banned, is not going to happen.
[02:09:52.317 --> 02:09:54.217]  But again, we have to at least cling to that hope.
[02:09:54.887 --> 02:10:03.250]  That him being on the board, him being the largest shareholder, him valuing free speech, will have some kind of influence on Twitter.
[02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:09.652]  And boy, is the regime, and the regime's gophers and minions, panicking about it.
[02:10:09.952 --> 02:10:11.133]  Which is always good to see.
[02:10:12.273 --> 02:10:22.317]  Meanwhile, Zero Hedge reports, New York Times top editor orders reporters to quote, meaningfully reduce Twitter usage as Musk joins company board.
[02:10:23.433 --> 02:10:55.187]   Just days after Elon Musk, a self-described free speech absolutist, unveiled a 9.2% stake in Twitter and was rewarded with the seat on the company's board, listing cheers from Republicans and Conservatives who had long seen their speech suppressed on the platform, the New York Times executive editor has reportedly ordered the paper's army of reporters, many of whom are among the platform's most closely followed journalists, to reduce the amount of time they spend tweeting They're basically telling them, stop scrolling on Twitter, stop tweeting, it's a waste of time.
[02:10:55.307 --> 02:10:59.609]  So they're indications that they're telling them to move away from the platform.
[02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:08.175]  Maybe they're going to try and go back to Facebook, I don't know, in terms of making that the number one news platform in terms of social media.
[02:11:08.515 --> 02:11:15.960]  But indications from the New York Times that they are going cold on Twitter in the aftermath of this Elon Musk news.
[02:11:17.125 --> 02:11:25.592]  Let's move on, though, now, because we have a French presidential election, first round of which is just a few days away on Sunday.
[02:11:26.632 --> 02:11:31.856]  Next segment, when I come back, I'm going to play you a video which talks about the shocking results of a poll.
[02:11:32.657 --> 02:11:33.958]  First, though, we have this headline.
[02:11:34.631 --> 02:11:42.898]  President Macron says he is opposed to self-defense after farmer shoots one of four burglars who broke into his home.
[02:11:43.419 --> 02:11:52.707]  This is the extraordinary story of a 35-year-old farmer in northern France who was having his home broken into at 11 p.m.
[02:11:52.747 --> 02:11:53.167]  at night.
[02:11:53.267 --> 02:11:56.049]  He's got his three-year-old daughter there in the house.
[02:11:56.750 --> 02:12:12.483]   He confronts these four burglars, very brave of him, If you don't know France, they still have hunting, again God forbid, so they have a lot of loopholes that allow them to get around the bans on private ownership of firearms.
[02:12:12.523 --> 02:12:16.689]  You still have many farmers who are allowed to have shotguns and things like that.
[02:12:17.620 --> 02:12:21.463]  So four burglars, four criminals, break into his house.
[02:12:21.503 --> 02:12:23.004]  He's got his three-year-old daughter there.
[02:12:23.404 --> 02:12:24.805]  He shoots one of them dead.
[02:12:25.165 --> 02:12:25.845]  Good for him.
[02:12:26.446 --> 02:12:34.151]  But Macron responded by basically throwing this guy, who should be hailed as a hero and yet has been charged with murder, under a bus.
[02:12:35.251 --> 02:12:39.282]   He said, quote, Bear in mind this is on the eve of the presidential election.
[02:12:39.682 --> 02:12:40.523]  Bit of a known goal.
[02:12:41.063 --> 02:12:43.484]  I am opposed to self-defense.
[02:12:43.864 --> 02:12:54.630]  He literally thinks the farmer should have cowered in a corner, allowed these four criminals to ransack his house, potentially harm his three-year-old daughter, and do absolutely nothing.
[02:12:54.650 --> 02:12:59.912]  We're going to come back and talk about that and other massive developments in France ahead of the election on the other side.
[02:12:59.752 --> 02:13:01.752]  summit.news.gov.
[02:13:01.752 --> 02:13:13.752]  [Music]
[02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:21.512]   In December of 2021, InfoWars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776
[02:13:21.512 --> 02:13:27.111]  anti-tyrant coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[02:13:25.761 --> 02:13:33.368]   And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, A founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[02:13:33.768 --> 02:13:40.833]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin, is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again.
[02:13:41.193 --> 02:13:43.255]  It certainly needs to to fund our operation.
[02:13:43.675 --> 02:13:45.316]   It is so Historic.
[02:13:45.596 --> 02:13:52.037]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[02:13:52.517 --> 02:13:56.198]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[02:13:56.518 --> 02:13:58.458]  It's also at infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:58.778 --> 02:13:59.439]  It's amazing.
[02:13:59.699 --> 02:14:01.199]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[02:14:01.519 --> 02:14:09.260]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:12.301]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[02:14:14.361 --> 02:14:18.485]  So the first round of the French presidential election takes place on Sunday.
[02:14:18.505 --> 02:14:23.269]  You have Eric Zemmour, the firebrand right-wing intellectual.
[02:14:23.309 --> 02:14:28.594]  You have Marine Le Pen, the populist whose economic policies are somewhat left-wing.
[02:14:28.614 --> 02:14:36.982]  You couldn't describe them as right-wing, and she's kind of strayed away or done a light touch on the subject of mass immigration, but she talks about crime.
[02:14:37.850 --> 02:14:47.617]  President Macron himself has talked about crime, much to his own misfortune in the past few days, because you had a 35-year-old farmer in northern France.
[02:14:47.697 --> 02:14:50.199]  Four burglars broke into his home at 11 p.m.
[02:14:50.559 --> 02:14:52.000]  He shot one of them dead.
[02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:54.862]  He was there in his home with his three-year-old daughter.
[02:14:55.663 --> 02:15:10.210]   And instead of coming out and defending this brave individual, who had been charged with murder, for defending himself inside his own home, as burglars tried to rampage through it, He's come out on the side of the criminals.
[02:15:11.251 --> 02:15:18.215]  Macron responded to this home invasion by coming down on the side of the burglars.
[02:15:18.255 --> 02:15:21.096]  He said, quote, I am opposed to self-defense.
[02:15:21.877 --> 02:15:28.400]  It's very clear and undisputable because otherwise the country becomes the Wild West and I don't want a country where weapons proliferate.
[02:15:28.981 --> 02:15:31.942]  Again, he told the farmer that he should have called the police.
[02:15:32.703 --> 02:15:36.245]  The police aren't even out there in the rural areas for a start.
[02:15:36.883 --> 02:15:47.508]  The police who have to come from the nearby towns and cities are completely overstretched because they have gangs of migrant criminals running around committing crimes when the police try to intervene.
[02:15:47.709 --> 02:15:51.450]  This is why you have migrant riots in French cities on a regular basis.
[02:15:52.231 --> 02:15:55.813]  The migrant gangs go and attack the police for trying to enforce the law.
[02:15:56.153 --> 02:15:57.974]  We've talked about it numerous times before.
[02:15:58.494 --> 02:16:06.110]   No-go zones where the ambulance workers, the fire brigade, will go into these riot zones Try to help people.
[02:16:06.450 --> 02:16:07.471]  Try to put out fires.
[02:16:07.811 --> 02:16:10.573]  And they're pelted with rocks by these migrant gangs.
[02:16:11.054 --> 02:16:12.895]  The police are completely overrun.
[02:16:13.255 --> 02:16:14.456]  They're completely stretched.
[02:16:14.897 --> 02:16:17.178]  So, no, you can't just call the police.
[02:16:18.599 --> 02:16:19.900]  Oh, there's four guys.
[02:16:20.181 --> 02:16:22.402]  You've got a three-year-old toddler next to you.
[02:16:22.823 --> 02:16:25.104]  There's four criminals breaking into your home.
[02:16:25.144 --> 02:16:25.965]  Just call the police.
[02:16:26.705 --> 02:16:29.408]  I'm sure it'll take them only a few hours to get there.
[02:16:30.028 --> 02:16:33.651]  While they ransack your home and potentially kill you.
[02:16:35.009 --> 02:16:39.691]  What kind of idiot advised Macron on this a few days before the election?
[02:16:40.732 --> 02:16:42.032]  But again, it is Macron.
[02:16:43.313 --> 02:16:49.836]  He also came out with more dumb comments, and this is why he has a chance of actually losing the election, which I'm going to get on to.
[02:16:50.596 --> 02:16:54.998]  This is a headline out of Remix News, rmx.news.
[02:16:55.438 --> 02:16:59.760]  We are not overwhelmed, left-wing Macron buries head in sand over mass migration.
[02:17:00.481 --> 02:17:09.405]  So mass migration, according to the polls in France, has been an absolute focal centrepiece of the entire election debate.
[02:17:10.005 --> 02:17:11.946]  Macron's basically dismissed it entirely.
[02:17:11.966 --> 02:17:19.849]  He said France is not a country overwhelmed by mass immigration and a policy of zero immigration is not one that should be taken seriously.
[02:17:21.707 --> 02:17:31.354]  Because, of course, you have Eric Zemmour, who's advocated a policy of re-migration, sending migrants with criminal backgrounds back to their home countries, which you can't do under the law in France.
[02:17:31.394 --> 02:17:35.757]  They have agreements with North African countries where they can actually do that legally.
[02:17:36.718 --> 02:17:49.507]  But in response to concerns put to him about the rate and success of France's immigration policy during his presidency, Macron hit back at claims from a number of his electoral rivals that France is saturated, claiming the country is not submerged.
[02:17:50.157 --> 02:17:59.821]  You have areas of Paris where there are literally hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, not just migrants, illegal immigrants living in one area.
[02:18:00.321 --> 02:18:09.105]  There was a story the other day about a Jewish man who was literally chased by a migrant gang in Paris to the point where he ran into a train.
[02:18:09.725 --> 02:18:10.765]  That's how bad it is.
[02:18:11.646 --> 02:18:19.189]  But Macron says, quote, our country is not overwhelmed, as some claim, and zero immigration is neither realistic nor desirable.
[02:18:20.359 --> 02:18:24.321]  They have a foreign population of about 8% officially.
[02:18:24.681 --> 02:18:27.802]  It's over 10% if you count the unofficial numbers.
[02:18:27.842 --> 02:18:32.003]  Obviously, they're not going to be able to count the huge number of illegal immigrants.
[02:18:32.083 --> 02:18:33.064]  It's only rising.
[02:18:33.744 --> 02:18:44.308]  We've seen the Paris massacre happen as a result of that refugee wave being opened up to literal jihadists who stole fake passports and were invited into Europe.
[02:18:45.382 --> 02:18:49.289]  We see police officers' teachers being beheaded, attacked on a regular basis.
[02:18:49.710 --> 02:18:53.617]  So Macron cannot dismiss this without it damaging his election chances.
[02:18:53.637 --> 02:18:54.699]  We'll be back on the other side.
[02:18:54.719 --> 02:18:54.999]  Summit.
[02:18:55.059 --> 02:19:18.578]   The It is the fourth hour.
[02:19:18.618 --> 02:19:19.859]  It is the Summit News Hour.
[02:19:19.959 --> 02:19:29.666]  And before the break, I was talking about President Macron facing what appears to be a tight race in the first round of the presidential election on Sunday.
[02:19:29.706 --> 02:19:31.488]  Of course, he's going to get through to the second round.
[02:19:31.508 --> 02:19:34.350]  The way it works is everyone votes for their candidates in the first round.
[02:19:34.910 --> 02:19:40.795]  The highest percentage tolls, two of whom go through to the second round, which then takes place a few weeks later.
[02:19:41.644 --> 02:19:43.705]  Macron is going to get through to the second round.
[02:19:43.745 --> 02:19:46.107]  The question is who is going to be his challenger.
[02:19:46.127 --> 02:19:52.771]  From the polls, it looks like Marine Le Pen, and I'm going to get on to an even more important poll here in a moment.
[02:19:53.651 --> 02:20:03.497]  But Macron's come out with some bizarre statement, throwing a guy who tried to defend his house and his three-year-old daughter from criminals under a bus because he shot them dead.
[02:20:04.184 --> 02:20:13.710]  You also came out and basically denied that mass uncontrolled immigration was a problem in France despite the evidence of the past, what, eight years proving that to be a completely ludicrous statement.
[02:20:14.290 --> 02:20:24.897]  You have a large concentration of support around all these rival candidates based on what is a core issue in France, mass uncontrolled immigration, and Macron thinks he can just ignore it.
[02:20:25.561 --> 02:20:29.643]  One person who isn't ignoring it is the former French intelligence chief.
[02:20:29.703 --> 02:20:42.288]  This is the equivalent of the former head of the CIA in France, Pierre Brochan, who warns that Europe and France, unless they radically change their policies on mass immigration, civil war could break out.
[02:20:42.768 --> 02:20:46.930]  And he said, quote, all multicultural societies are doomed.
[02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:59.195]  Again, this is the former head of the equivalent of the French CIA, DGSE, served from 2002 to 2008, and he made these comments during an interview with the prominent French newspaper Le Figaro.
[02:21:00.096 --> 02:21:05.041]  He said, quote, all multicultural societies are doomed to more or less deep rifts.
[02:21:05.661 --> 02:21:11.967]  Said, in such a situation it happens that minorities are violent winners and majorities placid losers.
[02:21:12.597 --> 02:21:25.588]  He went on to say the negative impact of mass immigration on France, which Macron completely ignores as even an election issue, can no longer be dismissed because it's, quote, increasingly difficult to prevent the French from seeing what they see.
[02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:33.735]  And also because, quote, a breakthrough personality suddenly appeared in the formulaic world of politics that has encouraged them to open their eyes.
[02:21:33.775 --> 02:21:37.258]  This is, again, former head of French intelligence saying this.
[02:21:37.838 --> 02:21:39.780]  This is no small potatoes.
[02:21:41.112 --> 02:21:56.583]   The ex-Intel chief predicts that if Macron does win, and fails to massively alter his approach, which he will fail to massively alter it, Civil war could ensue and remember we had those letters last year signed by top military generals in France.
[02:21:56.603 --> 02:22:14.850]  We had a similar letter signed by police officials in France saying that they fear civil war because they're no longer able to enforce basic law in many of these outskirts, suburban areas of major French cities which have been completely overrun by criminal migrant gangs.
[02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:17.991]  There's a complete collapse in law and order.
[02:22:19.542 --> 02:22:29.671]  This intelligence chief went on to say, quote, This gradual upheaval of the French population, if not the only challenge we face, is the only one that directly threatens civil peace on our territory.
[02:22:30.171 --> 02:22:40.199]  He warned that Muslim migrants and others from outside of Europe, who are increasing every year, have developed, quote, a spirit of post-colonial revenge.
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:43.142]  He goes on to talk about birth rates.
[02:22:44.517 --> 02:22:51.945]  And he goes on to talk about younger generations born of immigrants are, quote, even less integrated with French society than their parents.
[02:22:52.025 --> 02:22:58.252]  And that's a common theme that you see in numerous European countries, including here in the UK.
[02:22:58.713 --> 02:22:59.994]  So they're having more babies.
[02:23:00.034 --> 02:23:03.218]  The native French population isn't having babies.
[02:23:03.718 --> 02:23:13.098]   And in fact, polls show Much to the chagrin of the regime narrative that anyone who talks about, quote, the Great Replacement is a radical fringe conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:13.639 --> 02:23:25.048]  They had a poll where the majority of French people in a Harris Interactive poll felt that Europeans were being replaced by non-Europeans in countries like France.
[02:23:25.088 --> 02:23:30.352]  That is now a majority opinion in major European countries like France.
[02:23:30.412 --> 02:23:32.394]  So hardly fringe anymore, is it?
[02:23:33.115 --> 02:23:44.182]  So, Macron's ignoring that mass immigration is a central core issue in France, but the ex-head of the equivalent of the French CIA says otherwise and says it could cause civil war.
[02:23:44.643 --> 02:23:48.085]  Now, what is this going to cost Macron in terms of his election chances?
[02:23:48.525 --> 02:23:50.126]  His lead has been narrowing.
[02:23:50.346 --> 02:23:56.230]  Everyone expected he was a shoo-in to get re-elected, especially after the war in Ukraine.
[02:23:56.731 --> 02:24:01.654]  Obviously, leaders become more popular at times of war, except Joe Biden has booked that trend.
[02:24:02.492 --> 02:24:23.545]  But in fact, a shock election poll that came out today actually has challenger Marine Le Pen, who was quite handily defeated by Macron in the previous presidential election in 2017, actually now leading the globalist candidate Emmanuel Macron in France for the presidential election.
[02:24:23.585 --> 02:24:24.706]  Here is the clip.
[02:24:27.145 --> 02:24:35.653]  A shocking poll released on the eve of the first round of the French election reveals that populist Marine Le Pen is leading President Emmanuel Macron.
[02:24:35.673 --> 02:24:43.080]  The poll conducted by Atlas Politico shows the National Rally leader beating the incumbent in a hypothetical run-off by one percentage point.
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:49.864]  Macron's lead over Le Pen has been narrowing in recent weeks and it now appears that the election could be on a knife edge.
[02:24:49.944 --> 02:24:57.670]  The survey was taken at around the same time Macron made some bizarre and potentially very damaging comments on self-defense.
[02:24:57.830 --> 02:25:11.495]   At a time when many police departments across France are being stretched to the very limit by a wave of migrant gang crime, A 35-year-old farmer in Longray was hit with murder charges after he shot one of four burglars who broke into his home.
[02:25:11.575 --> 02:25:16.096]  The farmer was at home at the time of the late-night break-in with his three-year-old daughter.
[02:25:16.176 --> 02:25:17.636]  President Macron's response?
[02:25:18.116 --> 02:25:20.237]  To throw the farmer under a bus.
[02:25:20.397 --> 02:25:22.617]  Quote, I am opposed to self-defense.
[02:25:22.677 --> 02:25:27.058]  It's very clear and indisputable because otherwise the country becomes the Wild West, Macron said.
[02:25:27.098 --> 02:25:32.659]  And I don't want a country where weapons proliferate and where we consider that it's up to the citizens to defend themselves.
[02:25:32.819 --> 02:25:38.920]  In other words, apart from the state, which is already overrun, the only people who are allowed to use weapons are criminals.
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:46.062]  Presumably the former should have just cowered in a corner while the burglars ransacked his home and potentially harmed his three-year-old kid.
[02:25:46.182 --> 02:25:51.743]  Macron has also repeatedly failed to address a central election issue throughout the debates.
[02:25:51.983 --> 02:25:53.303]  Mass immigration.
[02:25:53.403 --> 02:26:00.665]  While Le Pen has largely skirted around the issue, it's been left to intellectual firebrand Eric Zemmour to pick up the slack.
[02:26:00.845 --> 02:26:06.707]  Zemmour vowed to create a ministry of re-migration which would send migrants with criminal records back home.
[02:26:06.787 --> 02:26:17.150]  While former French intelligence chief Pierre Brochand, the equivalent of the head of the CIA, recently warned in an interview that quote, all multicultural societies are doomed.
[02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:24.712]  But Macron himself dismissed the issue, claiming that France isn't being submerged and that zero immigration isn't an option.
[02:26:24.732 --> 02:26:27.733]  But that isn't a view shared by much of the French electorate.
[02:26:27.773 --> 02:26:33.774]  A Harris Interactive poll found a majority of French believe Europeans are being replaced by non-Europeans.
[02:26:34.154 --> 02:26:37.395]  63% in a separate poll thought there were, quote, too many immigrants in France.
[02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:43.236]  And an IFOP survey found that 70% of French believe all immigration should be halted.
[02:26:43.336 --> 02:26:45.676]  Macron is still favourite to beat Le Pen.
[02:26:45.716 --> 02:26:53.818]  But his sheer tone deafness to one of the most important issues to French voters could just end up costing him the presidency.
[02:26:57.777 --> 02:27:11.562]  Now, the regime, again, just like the woke employees of Twitter, and again, if you're worried about, you know, Elon Musk having an influence on the policies or the rules of Twitter, just create your own social media network, right?
[02:27:11.642 --> 02:27:13.883]  Twitter's a private company, it can do what it wants.
[02:27:14.303 --> 02:27:15.943]  They're in panic, that's good.
[02:27:16.524 --> 02:27:27.735]   The regime are also in panic about this poll and Marine Le Pen potentially beating globalist candidate Macron There's a headline out of the New Republic, it says, Yes, be worried!
[02:27:28.195 --> 02:27:31.277]  Marine Le Pen could finally come to power in France!
[02:27:31.958 --> 02:27:37.361]  Oh my God, the French people could democratically elect a leader that the regime doesn't like!
[02:27:37.861 --> 02:27:38.962]  Oh, we can't have that!
[02:27:40.583 --> 02:27:54.888]   Emmanuel Macron's five-year term as president is drawing to a close, it says, and then it goes on in the article to express absolute horror and dread At the prospect of Marine Le Pen beating Emmanuel Macron.
[02:27:54.908 --> 02:28:02.793]  So when they're coming out with headlines like that in globalist publications like the New Republic, you know that the regime is scared.
[02:28:04.054 --> 02:28:09.498]  Meanwhile in Sweden, they're also enjoying the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism.
[02:28:10.038 --> 02:28:14.241]  Breitbart reports Sweden fatal shootings in first three months of 2022 over triple that of 2021.
[02:28:17.975 --> 02:28:25.477]  Now remember, 20 years ago Sweden was the most safe, the safest country in Europe and the entire continent.
[02:28:26.037 --> 02:28:30.658]  Now it's the second most dangerous in terms of gun crime after Croatia.
[02:28:31.038 --> 02:28:36.260]  Now what happened in the space of that 20 years to make Sweden more dangerous?
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:44.539]   Does it have anything to do with the fact that they accepted vast numbers of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa. Now they're having
[02:28:44.539 --> 02:28:51.000]   even greater problems with crime and with violence. We'll be back. Summit.News, don't go away. Now I
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:57.160]   want to get to these final two videos before we go to our guest in the next segment. Finishing up
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:03.780]   on Europe, we've got the elite, the regime in a blind panic about the slight potential. It's
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:08.780]   been listed as 25% that Marine Le Pen could beat globalist candidate Macron in the French
[02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:15.510]   election. Well, Prime Minister Orban in Hungary and other populists won in a landslide a few
[02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:16.559]  days ago.
[02:29:16.727 --> 02:29:17.307]  In Hungary.
[02:29:17.728 --> 02:29:24.511]  And now the EU is sanctioning Hungary because Hungarians democratically elected a Prime Minister.
[02:29:24.851 --> 02:29:25.772]  How dare they?
[02:29:26.252 --> 02:29:28.413]  That the EU doesn't like.
[02:29:28.513 --> 02:29:31.754]  This is EU punishes Hungary for electing Orbán.
[02:29:31.774 --> 02:29:32.195]  Here's the clip.
[02:29:33.015 --> 02:29:44.524]  If there was ever any doubt as to the EU being a horrendous authoritarian anachronism, they're now sanctioning Hungary because Hungarians elected a Prime Minister that the EU doesn't like.
[02:29:44.684 --> 02:29:45.525]  Yeah, really.
[02:29:45.625 --> 02:29:50.589]  On Sunday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban was returned to office with a landslide victory.
[02:29:50.629 --> 02:29:56.893]  You mean to say Hungarians used their democratic vote to democratically elect a leader of their choice?
[02:29:57.073 --> 02:30:01.035]  Someone who actually represents the interests of the Hungarian people?
[02:30:01.055 --> 02:30:04.157]  And not faceless EU globalist super-state technocrats?
[02:30:04.357 --> 02:30:05.958]  Oh no, we can't have that!
[02:30:06.178 --> 02:30:11.982]  In response, the EU announced it would use an extraordinary new mechanism to cut funding to Hungary.
[02:30:12.022 --> 02:30:18.826]  To be clear, the EU is directly punishing ordinary, hard-working Hungarians who chose to vote for Orbán.
[02:30:19.346 --> 02:30:21.428]  As well as those who didn't vote for Orbán.
[02:30:21.488 --> 02:30:29.657]  Millions of Euros that would have gone to pay for building roads, funding schools and covering medical care will now be vindictively snatched away.
[02:30:29.818 --> 02:30:38.327]  And this all happened after billionaire globalist oligarch George Soros demanded that Hungary be made a quote, test case.
[02:30:38.607 --> 02:30:40.969]  In other words, be made an example of.
[02:30:41.049 --> 02:30:46.572]  Because Hungary refused to bow to the EU Commission's supposed, quote, values.
[02:30:46.672 --> 02:30:52.496]  Namely, wide open borders and mandatory LGBT teaching in classrooms.
[02:30:52.576 --> 02:31:03.724]  The EU was big mad that Hungary's National Assembly passed a law banning the promotion of material related to homosexuality or transgenderism in education, on television movies or in advertisements.
[02:31:03.884 --> 02:31:04.164]  No, no.
[02:31:04.264 --> 02:31:08.207]  Don't you dare try and impede the regime's indoctrination of your kids.
[02:31:08.787 --> 02:31:13.672]  Even via a parliamentary vote, or we'll financially sabotage your country.
[02:31:13.752 --> 02:31:17.816]  Should we really be surprised that the EU still behaves like a dictatorship?
[02:31:17.896 --> 02:31:30.289]  This is the same body that when the French voted in a majority to reject the EU constitution back in 2005, the French political class and the EU simply adopted it anyway under the Lisbon Treaty.
[02:31:30.509 --> 02:31:32.350]  Which was virtually identical.
[02:31:32.370 --> 02:31:41.456]  Then when the Irish rejected the Lisbon Treaty in 2008, the EU simply made them vote on it again in 2009 until they got the result they wanted.
[02:31:41.536 --> 02:31:48.440]  Turns out that unelected bureaucrats don't like the idea of people having to be voted into power by an electorate.
[02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.541]  Imagine my shock.
[02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:55.164]  The EU is a disgusting, foul beast that should be consigned to the ash heap of history.
[02:31:55.304 --> 02:31:59.427]  We need Brexit, continent-wide, and we need it ASAP.
[02:32:02.119 --> 02:32:03.726]  That wraps up the situation in Europe.
[02:32:03.766 --> 02:32:06.076]  Now I want to switch to Covid because we don't have long left.
[02:32:06.778 --> 02:32:12.922]  Absolutely mad situation in Shanghai, where they have another lockdown, indefinite lockdown.
[02:32:13.202 --> 02:32:15.303]  Zero Covid has been a complete disaster.
[02:32:15.363 --> 02:32:16.124]  This is the clip.
[02:32:16.644 --> 02:32:20.126]  Revolt in Shanghai against new lockdown madness.
[02:32:20.206 --> 02:32:20.707]  Here it is.
[02:32:21.307 --> 02:32:29.212]  We're now seeing open revolt from the normally submissive, compliant Chinese in response to yet another new lockdown in Shanghai.
[02:32:29.272 --> 02:32:36.436]  The city's 26 million residents were initially placed under a nine-day lockdown, but now that has been extended indefinitely.
[02:32:36.496 --> 02:32:39.198]  But they're mad as hell and they're not gonna take it anymore.
[02:32:39.378 --> 02:32:45.224]  Even faced with the prospect of losing points from their precious social credit scores, they've simply had enough.
[02:32:45.404 --> 02:32:52.630]  The breaking point appears to have been disgraceful scenes showing children being separated from their parents inside quarantine facilities.
[02:32:52.810 --> 02:33:01.132]  Chinese social media shows children, even infants, separated from their families at a Shanghai hospital after testing positive for COVID-19.
[02:33:01.672 --> 02:33:03.512]  Isolated alone, crying.
[02:33:03.572 --> 02:33:08.574]  As well as people being prevented from going out to buy food or seeking urgent medical care.
[02:33:08.754 --> 02:33:11.514]  Anger is reaching a boiling point in Shanghai.
[02:33:11.794 --> 02:33:18.236]  Chinese social media showing residents in lockdown protesting, chanting, we want jobs, we want freedom.
[02:33:19.036 --> 02:33:24.161]  Hundreds in one Shanghai neighborhood broke out of confinement, pleading for affordable food.
[02:33:24.622 --> 02:33:28.526]  This resident confronts the police, yelling, why are we being starved?
[02:33:28.646 --> 02:33:31.188]  They're not even allowed out for exercise.
[02:33:31.349 --> 02:33:33.971]  Residents aren't even allowed to briefly step outside.
[02:33:34.372 --> 02:33:37.735]  CNN filmed this man walking in his apartment compound.
[02:33:38.055 --> 02:33:40.378]  He was immediately escorted back home.
[02:33:40.578 --> 02:33:45.923]  People are dropping dead in the street because ambulance workers are refusing to get out and treat them.
[02:33:46.043 --> 02:33:50.266]  A woman is screaming in desperation for the paramedic to help an asthma patient.
[02:33:50.286 --> 02:33:56.472]  His heart has stopped, she said, pleading to borrow the ambulance's defibrillator.
[02:33:57.152 --> 02:33:59.194]  But the paramedics refuse to help.
[02:33:59.314 --> 02:34:03.517]  But what CNN won't tell you is why Shanghai is in this mess.
[02:34:03.657 --> 02:34:15.767]  Because unlike other European countries who have chosen to live with COVID and get on with life, China has pursued a disastrous zero-COVID policy which ensures that the rolling lockdowns will never end.
[02:34:16.007 --> 02:34:21.651]  We were told 80% of adults in Shanghai had been fully vaccinated, and this was in August last year.
[02:34:21.731 --> 02:34:25.154]  That was supposed to provide them with, quote, herd immunity.
[02:34:25.214 --> 02:34:33.020]  Yet Shanghai just experienced more COVID cases in the previous four weeks than during the entire previous two years of the pandemic.
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:34.661]  100% safe and effective.
[02:34:34.701 --> 02:34:37.363]  And remember, all this is in response to Omicron.
[02:34:37.282 --> 02:34:43.882]   Despite months and months of data from other countries proving it to be milder than previous variants,
[02:34:43.882 --> 02:34:48.483]   Shanghai residents are appearing at their balconies in unison to sing protest songs,
[02:34:48.483 --> 02:34:53.681]   only to be confronted by drones with loudspeakers telling them to go back inside.
[02:34:53.681 --> 02:35:06.282]  [Chinese radio broadcast]
[02:35:06.282 --> 02:35:11.681]   There's also reports of the government forcibly euthanizing the pets of COVID infectees.
[02:35:11.805 --> 02:35:18.270]  And lest we forget, China's draconian lockdown was the model for Western countries two years ago.
[02:35:18.370 --> 02:35:24.355]   Professor Lockdown, Neil Ferguson, said on record, Quote, it's a communist one-party state, we said.
[02:35:24.575 --> 02:35:27.317]  We couldn't get away with it in Europe, we thought.
[02:35:27.557 --> 02:35:30.059]  And then Italy did it, and we realised we could.
[02:35:30.119 --> 02:35:34.422]  Lockdowns are, and always were, a devastating moral outrage.
[02:35:34.502 --> 02:35:44.569]  And just because we've learned to live with Covid in the West, doesn't mean those who promoted and implemented the horrors of lockdown shouldn't be held responsible and investigated.
[02:35:44.669 --> 02:35:50.113]  And if necessary, prosecuted for the horrendous damage they've done to society.
[02:35:52.830 --> 02:36:01.393]  Now, bear in mind that you have the irony of CNN siding with these Chinese protesters who are, quote, crying about their freedom and their jobs.
[02:36:01.894 --> 02:36:12.318]  CNN being the same network who lobbied in the West, in the United States, for the past two years for lockdown, which cost people jobs, businesses, and their freedom.
[02:36:12.358 --> 02:36:22.342]  So for CNN to, you know, get in there like they're the moral arbiter, like they're the great defender of freedom and jobs against lockdown, is absolutely hilarious.
[02:36:23.024 --> 02:36:27.710]  But again, that shows in China the complete disaster that zero Covid policies have.
[02:36:28.711 --> 02:36:36.361]  Meanwhile, Daily Skeptic reports babies struggling with facial expressions after months of lockdown and masks.
[02:36:36.822 --> 02:36:39.806]  This is an official report by the Ofsted organisation.
[02:36:40.549 --> 02:36:44.414]  And again, I still see kids outside.
[02:36:44.434 --> 02:36:47.778]  That doesn't mean any mask rules in England for three months.
[02:36:48.318 --> 02:36:51.883]  Parents have their kids outside wearing masks.
[02:36:52.243 --> 02:36:53.805]  It's literally retarding them.
[02:36:54.045 --> 02:36:56.088]  It's retarding other babies and toddlers.
[02:36:56.986 --> 02:37:07.975]  Based on its analysis, Ofsted reported delays in babies and children's speech and language development and the fact that some babies have struggled to respond to basic facial expressions.
[02:37:08.555 --> 02:37:16.101]  So all the people who claim the moral high ground by making kids wear masks are actually stunting their cognitive development.
[02:37:16.142 --> 02:37:20.225]  They need to stop it and realise the gross harm that they're doing.
[02:37:20.625 --> 02:37:22.106]  Summit.News will be back.
[02:37:22.327 --> 02:37:22.787]  Don't go away.
[02:37:23.584 --> 02:37:27.546]  We are live, it is the Summit News Hour, and I'm joined by our guest.
[02:37:27.566 --> 02:37:28.726]  We had him on on Monday.
[02:37:28.746 --> 02:37:32.568]  He is Michael de la Brock of the Telegram channel Bohanka Watch.
[02:37:32.628 --> 02:37:38.371]  He is following primary sources on the ground in Ukraine, both pro-Russia, pro-Ukraine.
[02:37:38.411 --> 02:37:40.852]  Yes, both sides in wars have propaganda.
[02:37:41.532 --> 02:37:42.753]  Incredible that may be.
[02:37:42.773 --> 02:37:45.174]  And we have another story here.
[02:37:45.394 --> 02:37:51.548]   Of course, on Monday we were talking about the Alleged war crimes committed by Russian troops.
[02:37:51.588 --> 02:37:54.769]  I'm going to get to any update on that later on in the show in Booker.
[02:37:55.289 --> 02:38:01.590]  But now we have the return of yet another fake news story, and that is Russian mobile crematoriums.
[02:38:01.650 --> 02:38:06.471]  Headline, viral Russian mobile crematorium tweet is from an eight-year-old YouTube video.
[02:38:07.131 --> 02:38:11.592]  This circled at the beginning of the war, and it's doing the rounds yet again.
[02:38:12.332 --> 02:38:16.953]  No warning label slapped on this viral tweet from a news agency.
[02:38:17.603 --> 02:38:20.746]  That claims there's a mobile crematorium in Mariupol.
[02:38:21.526 --> 02:38:27.891]  You go and reverse search the image, and we already did it a month ago, because this came out a month ago, was debunked.
[02:38:27.951 --> 02:38:28.872]  Now it's back again.
[02:38:28.892 --> 02:38:34.276]  And it's from a YouTube video from a dumpster from eight years ago.
[02:38:34.977 --> 02:38:51.899]   Now on the flip side of this, they are claiming in Mariupol The mayor and other officials are claiming that there's basically a quote new Auschwitz that's happened with quote tens of thousands of bodies being burned by the Russians to cover up a massacre.
[02:38:52.469 --> 02:38:54.870]  Now whether that's happening or not, we'll get into it.
[02:38:55.350 --> 02:39:04.872]  What I know is not evidence of that is a tweet which has gone viral showing a dumpster from eight years ago from a screenshotted YouTube video.
[02:39:05.272 --> 02:39:10.973]  That is not evidence of tens of thousands of people being burned in Mariupol.
[02:39:11.413 --> 02:39:17.335]  And yet I put this out on Twitter and some of the respondents were like, oh well, it's just a stock image.
[02:39:18.135 --> 02:39:18.455]  Bull!
[02:39:19.224 --> 02:39:29.031]  If I posted an image of Russians being slaughtered by Ukrainians and it was from 2014, they'd pull me up on that like you'd never believe.
[02:39:29.071 --> 02:39:31.792]  They'd say I was engaging in fake news.
[02:39:32.173 --> 02:39:35.635]  Twitter would slap it with a fact check or they'd make me delete the tweet.
[02:39:36.175 --> 02:39:36.676]  They do it.
[02:39:37.336 --> 02:39:37.776]  On a whim.
[02:39:37.896 --> 02:39:38.657]  And they get away with it.
[02:39:38.697 --> 02:39:39.997]  I just refreshed the tweet.
[02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:40.998]  Nothing's happened to it.
[02:39:41.038 --> 02:39:42.058]  It's still gone viral.
[02:39:42.339 --> 02:39:45.820]  There's still a bunch of people below it saying, oh my god, this is a new Auschwitz.
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:49.122]  It's a screenshot from an eight-year-old YouTube video.
[02:39:49.862 --> 02:39:51.343]  Michael, welcome back to the show.
[02:39:51.403 --> 02:39:54.965]  What is the latest on what is happening in Mariupol?
[02:39:55.405 --> 02:39:57.106]  These claims of a new Auschwitz.
[02:39:57.961 --> 02:40:10.533]  And what do you think about this once again debunked fake news story about this mobile crematorium circling on Twitter going viral and not being fact-checked by the esteemed fact-checkers?
[02:40:10.593 --> 02:40:11.574]  Tell us what's going on.
[02:40:12.936 --> 02:40:15.178]  Yeah, thank you very much for having me back on Paul.
[02:40:15.358 --> 02:40:22.345]  So yeah, as you outlined, this is an allegation that's now allegedly what's happening in Mariupol for people who aren't aware.
[02:40:23.490 --> 02:40:35.281]  On the fourth day, so the 28th of February, Mariupol was surrounded by the Russian army and since then it has been subject to siege for the past, coming up to around about a month and a half now.
[02:40:35.721 --> 02:40:39.845]  It has been quite a brutal siege, there's been a lot of killing and death on both sides.
[02:40:41.617 --> 02:40:55.127]  In terms of the claims of the specific allegations that you're addressing, yeah, if this is actually what is happening, it would be one of the best kept secrets that the Russians have been able to sustain throughout this war.
[02:40:55.568 --> 02:40:59.851]  And the Russians haven't been very good at keeping various things secret.
[02:41:01.252 --> 02:41:07.397]  So from my understanding, the specific allegations seem to come from the mayor of Mariupol, from Vadim Boychenko.
[02:41:08.244 --> 02:41:39.743]   Uh from my understanding is he has not been in the city since essentially before it was actually surrounded and besieged and most of the city council fled the city before the the siege began so that's not precluding that they don't have contacts within the city of course they do but They have provided no, that I have been able to see anyway, no validation, no proof of these alleged mobile crematoria going on that's apparently operating within the city.
[02:41:40.283 --> 02:41:45.747]  And if these are operating in the city, they are not doing a very good job, to put it bluntly.
[02:41:45.847 --> 02:42:09.602]   I don't particularly want to get very grisly into what's been happening in Mariupol, but It has been a very brutal battle and unfortunately there has been significant civilian casualties and anyone who's been following the events in Mariupol and in this part of the war for any length of time will know that every day there is a constant stream of footage coming out of the city.
[02:42:11.073 --> 02:42:12.994]  The Russians themselves are releasing footage.
[02:42:13.014 --> 02:42:19.156]  The Azov and Ukrainian troops within the city, whenever they had the ability to, they were releasing footage.
[02:42:19.296 --> 02:42:26.318]  Kadyrov, Ramzan Kadyrov's fighters, the Chechens, are constantly filming stuff in the city and ironically uploading it to TikTok.
[02:42:26.538 --> 02:42:27.738]  There's independent journalists.
[02:42:28.739 --> 02:42:44.494]   Through that footage, it is quite evident that the civilians who have been killed They're usually left to lay on the streets for a number of days until other civilians come and basically bury them within the city parks or beside the roads.
[02:42:45.514 --> 02:42:49.197]  I have not seen any evidence of these crematoria operating.
[02:42:50.686 --> 02:42:59.290]  If they are operating, someone somewhere would have filmed them because the vehicle from the YouTube video that it's purported to be from is very distinctive.
[02:42:59.350 --> 02:43:11.395]  It does not look like any of the other Russian military vehicles, be it more Western and Ukrainian aligned open source internet investigators, be it Russians or Donetsk fighters themselves.
[02:43:11.816 --> 02:43:15.765]   They would have picked up on the presence of this vehicle and there's been no footage
[02:43:15.765 --> 02:43:16.895]  at all that I have seen.
[02:43:16.895 --> 02:43:20.735]   Not to say it isn't happening but it would be one of the best cap secrets that the Russians
[02:43:20.735 --> 02:43:24.574]   have been able to keep under their their shirts so far during this conflict.
[02:43:24.574 --> 02:43:30.175]  Yeah I've got a headline here from LBC.
[02:43:30.455 --> 02:43:32.016]  And again, I talked about it on Monday.
[02:43:32.436 --> 02:43:40.141]  They literally had reports come out in legacy media outlets during the invasion of Iraq saying 400,000 dead in mass grave.
[02:43:40.181 --> 02:43:42.542]  Turned out to be complete BS.
[02:43:42.963 --> 02:43:44.203]  This LBC headline.
[02:43:44.443 --> 02:43:47.625]  Again, no one's denying that there's death and carnage.
[02:43:47.785 --> 02:43:48.386]  It's a war.
[02:43:49.102 --> 02:43:52.505]  But the way they're framing it, the headline is, the new Auschwitz.
[02:43:52.966 --> 02:43:56.710]  Bodies of 10,000 Ukrainian civilians incinerated.
[02:43:57.230 --> 02:44:07.400]  And then the mayor, as you said, Boychenko, comes out and says, quote, the world has not seen the scale of the tragedy in Mariupol since the existence of Nazi concentration camps.
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.419]   They're actually going with this Full-scale propaganda on the level of Auschwitz.
[02:44:13.819 --> 02:44:22.047]  And if you type in mobile crematoriums to Google News, there's literally hundreds of news stories just repeating it ad infinitum.
[02:44:22.467 --> 02:44:25.377]   And again, we've had The Ghost of Kiev Force.
[02:44:25.437 --> 02:44:29.199]  Obviously, we've had the alleged slaughter of Ukrainian soldiers on Snake Island.
[02:44:29.239 --> 02:44:29.859]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:29.879 --> 02:44:30.940]  They peacefully surrendered.
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:33.561]  We had the attack on a Holocaust memorial in Kiev.
[02:44:34.042 --> 02:44:34.662]  Never happened.
[02:44:35.182 --> 02:44:36.963]  We've got this on Twitter.
[02:44:37.463 --> 02:44:41.246]  I mean, listen to the responses to this tweet, which is still up.
[02:44:41.346 --> 02:44:47.229]  It's got 11,000 likes, 7,000 plus retweets, been seen hundreds of thousands of times.
[02:44:48.007 --> 02:44:50.729]  The response is, this is Auschwitz on wheels!
[02:44:51.069 --> 02:44:54.231]  The horrors being unleashed are on a par, if not worse than what the Nazis did.
[02:44:54.251 --> 02:44:59.174]  Someone else says, nothing to see here, just Russian mobile crematoria entering European cities.
[02:44:59.515 --> 02:45:01.376]  It's a dumpster from eight years ago.
[02:45:01.956 --> 02:45:07.300]  Now, we know why they're doing this, because they want the no-fly zone, they want the escalation.
[02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:08.981]  In fact, I posted this.
[02:45:09.904 --> 02:45:15.028]  And within two minutes, someone had responded, calling me a Russian bot.
[02:45:15.509 --> 02:45:24.477]  Like, no, I'm a real person, I'm literally responding, and whether you call me a Russian bot or not, you're engaging in bot behavior by responding within two seconds by saying that.
[02:45:24.857 --> 02:45:29.581]  And it's a screenshot from an eight-year-old YouTube video, whoever tells you that or not.
[02:45:30.157 --> 02:45:35.260]  Gonna come back on the other side, Michael, but I want to get into, again, updates on Bukka.
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:36.640]  I want to get into this.
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.602]  Pentagon says Russia-Ukraine war is likely to last for years.
[02:45:41.303 --> 02:45:52.949]  This was a House Armed Services Committee where Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the war will last for years, it could escalate, which is interesting because that ties into this headline.
[02:45:53.549 --> 02:45:57.351]  Washington Post admits NATO wants to prolong war in Ukraine.
[02:45:58.231 --> 02:46:05.563]  This was a Washington Post article where they admitted they wanted to weaken, demoralize and drain Russia.
[02:46:06.258 --> 02:46:10.159]  By having it fight in Ukraine for the foreseeable future.
[02:46:10.239 --> 02:46:15.061]  So, of course, that's going to equate to more people on both sides of the conflict dying.
[02:46:15.601 --> 02:46:19.342]  So we've got forces within NATO wanting to prolong the conflict.
[02:46:19.722 --> 02:46:21.063]  They don't want a peace deal.
[02:46:21.463 --> 02:46:29.026]  And we've got members of the US military-industrial complex saying the same thing, that the war is going to go on for years.
[02:46:29.046 --> 02:46:33.187]  I also want to come back briefly in the next segment and talk with Michael about this.
[02:46:33.867 --> 02:46:39.131]  New York Times verifies video showing Ukrainian troops killing Russian prisoners of war near Bukha.
[02:46:39.612 --> 02:46:48.959]  So we've got the NY Times now basically saying that yes, prisoners of war are being slaughtered in violation of the Geneva Convention by Ukrainian troops.
[02:46:49.419 --> 02:46:58.626]  That didn't circulate very far out of the New York Times, unlike these allegations of literal Auschwitz-level war crimes in Mariupol.
[02:46:58.646 --> 02:46:59.527]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[02:47:00.325 --> 02:47:22.773]  We're live and we're talking to Michael de la Brock who runs the Telegram channel Bohanka Watch and you should all go and follow that channel on Telegram because he has the latest breaking news from primary on the ground sources in Ukraine, both pro-Ukraine, pro-Russian, to try to figure out which propaganda is closer to the truth in any given situation.
[02:47:22.813 --> 02:47:23.813]  Of course, that varies.
[02:47:24.949 --> 02:47:30.624]  Well, Michael, we've talked about the fake tweet of alleged Russian mobile crematoriums.
[02:47:30.664 --> 02:47:31.928]  Those claims are ongoing.
[02:47:32.876 --> 02:47:40.884]  Any updates on this alleged Russian massacre of civilians in Bukha and then your take on this headline?
[02:47:41.464 --> 02:47:47.610]  New York Times verifies video showing Ukrainian troops killing Russian prisoners of war near Bukha.
[02:47:48.050 --> 02:47:54.176]  Says the video was posted on Monday and depicts the killing of a wounded Russian soldier who was still breathing before he was shot three times.
[02:47:54.196 --> 02:47:56.839]  Of course, we had that previous video from a couple of weekends ago.
[02:47:57.439 --> 02:48:08.708]  Showing Russian POWs being shot in the arm, shot in the knee and left to die in agony, with Ukrainians filming that and thinking that it'd be a good idea to put it on social media.
[02:48:09.349 --> 02:48:14.052]  So, any developments on Buka since we last talked about it on Monday?
[02:48:14.673 --> 02:48:24.601]  And what do you make of this situation near Buka, where Russian troops or Russian prisoners of war were apparently killed by Ukrainian soldiers?
[02:48:26.218 --> 02:48:37.905]  Yeah, so unfortunately in terms of the Bushehr incident and the events around Erpin and Hostomel, as far as I can see there really isn't much more to be gleaned from it.
[02:48:39.165 --> 02:48:54.313]   Various satellite footage have come out that said to corroborate various pro-Ukrainian claims, but other than that it's just become this situation where Western media, pro-Ukrainian media have just effectively completely swamped out the narrative.
[02:48:54.693 --> 02:49:09.868]  So unless there is an actual proper forensic investigation into the specific events in Vuka, I don't think we're really going to get to an actual definitive truth proven by the forensics and by the science that can be gleaned from the events.
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:16.980]   itself. Unfortunately, as I've just said, the media narrative has been established and that
[02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:22.820]   seems to have completely crowded out and swamped any ability to try and discern what is alleged to
[02:49:22.820 --> 02:49:28.179]   have happened one way or the other. Of course, as we were saying on Monday, the Russian Ministry
[02:49:28.179 --> 02:49:33.620]   of Defence is very strongly protesting and disputing pretty much any allegations at all
[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:36.980]  from Bukha, which I think is probably a bit too strong.
[02:49:37.206 --> 02:49:45.949]  I do believe that there are instances in Bucha where it is very likely that the Russians have engaged in various allegations and were criminal.
[02:49:46.721 --> 02:49:47.382]  Uh, war crimes.
[02:49:48.062 --> 02:49:59.890]  But in terms of the wider events around the town, it, like I say, until there's a proper investigation by an independent body, it's, it's, I don't think we're really going to be able to ascertain it one way or the other at this stage.
[02:50:02.912 --> 02:50:11.317]  And give us the latest on what's happening on the ground today, because I mentioned, um, Washington Post admits NATO wants to prolong war in Ukraine.
[02:50:11.757 --> 02:50:17.177]   You have the Pentagon, Testifying, Joint Chiefs of Staff are basically saying it's going to last for years.
[02:50:17.757 --> 02:50:26.884]  Are they any closer to a peace deal and what are the main stories to arise in the past couple of days in terms of what's going on on the ground there?
[02:50:26.904 --> 02:50:44.167]   Okay, so just to quickly try and wrap it up in terms of what's actually, because it's quite a broad question and there's a lot of stuff going on, but Yes, this war is, I'm expecting at least to be around about six to nine months from where we are at the moment.
[02:50:44.227 --> 02:50:50.514]  It's currently mud season in Ukraine, that's slowing everything down until the summer sun comes and dries out the ground.
[02:50:50.875 --> 02:50:55.600]  The Russians are not going to be able to pull off massive advances and maneuvers like they did at the start of the war.
[02:50:56.181 --> 02:51:03.897]   In terms of a peace deal, I I've noticed over the past month that there has been a softening in the Ukrainian position on certain issues.
[02:51:04.698 --> 02:51:10.799]  Most noticeably, Zelensky and Kiev have dropped any pretense that they could ever join NATO.
[02:51:11.219 --> 02:51:17.721]  And there was an interesting sort of softening of their dialogue in terms of Crimea.
[02:51:18.749 --> 02:51:28.873]  But in terms of the Donbass and Donetsk and Lugansk, as far as I can see, the Ukrainians are still strongly holding to their, they refuse to budge on that issue.
[02:51:29.874 --> 02:51:37.117]  What is likely to happen over the next couple months is the Russians are building up their strength quite strongly in the east of the country.
[02:51:37.177 --> 02:51:41.899]  They are bringing in fresh troops from the Siberia, from the Far East.
[02:51:42.359 --> 02:51:44.861]  Fresh equipment from across Russia.
[02:51:45.141 --> 02:51:49.244]  They're redeploying their troops that were engaged in Kiev, in Chernigov and Sumy.
[02:51:49.264 --> 02:51:51.665]  They're being redeployed into the Donbass sector.
[02:51:53.367 --> 02:52:14.076]   It could be the decisive battle of the war, but the Russians and the Ukrainians know they're doing it and they're trying to prepare for it, but the Russians are building up for a massive offensive that is to completely take over the Donbass, achieve the territorial extent of the Lugansk and Donetsk republics, In many ways, whenever it does come to negotiations, it's a fait accompli.
[02:52:14.796 --> 02:52:17.257]  Ukraine will effectively be dealt with a hand.
[02:52:17.717 --> 02:52:19.458]  You don't control this territory at all.
[02:52:19.618 --> 02:52:22.819]  You've been completely defeated here and pushed out, so why are you still holding on to it?
[02:52:23.239 --> 02:52:37.202]   The problem there is the Russians at that stage could feel that they have committed too much man, they've lost too much blood, and they've lost too much equipment, that the Russians might Interestingly, I've seen some developments in Kherson and Zaporozhye.
[02:52:37.442 --> 02:52:42.144]  The Russians might actually extend what they're looking for into sovereign Ukraine for various reasons.
[02:52:45.345 --> 02:52:46.746]  Okay, Michael, we're going to leave it there.
[02:52:46.766 --> 02:52:47.946]  We'll be sure to have you back.
[02:52:48.126 --> 02:52:54.429]  But the Telegram channel is Bohanka Watch, or you can search for his name, Michael de la Brocque on Telegram.
[02:52:54.449 --> 02:52:59.151]  Be sure to follow that channel for the latest break-in updates.
[02:52:59.271 --> 02:53:00.091]  Michael, thanks again.
[02:53:00.111 --> 02:53:00.851]  We'll have you back soon.
[02:53:00.871 --> 02:53:02.292]  No problem.
[02:53:02.312 --> 02:53:02.772]  Thank you, Paul.
[02:53:04.438 --> 02:53:12.665]  Okay, we're going to go to some final news stories, but first I want to throw to this video, because I've been trying to play it for days basically, finally got the chance here at the end of the show.
[02:53:12.745 --> 02:53:13.546]  Quick two-minute video.
[02:53:14.249 --> 02:53:16.790]  This is keep them docile with drugs and video games.
[02:53:16.850 --> 02:53:25.673]  Wait till you hear what the man cited by the elite as one of the greatest living thinkers of the 21st century thinks about humanity.
[02:53:25.733 --> 02:53:26.393]  Here's the clip.
[02:53:27.033 --> 02:53:34.036]  Historian, professor and author Yuval Harari is listed as an agenda contributor to the World Economic Forum.
[02:53:34.056 --> 02:53:38.557]  He's also cited by virtually every technocrat and elitist worth their soul.
[02:53:38.597 --> 02:53:44.019]  They laboriously shower him with praise, heralding him as one of the 21st century's greatest thinkers.
[02:53:44.139 --> 02:53:53.988]  So should it concern us that Yuval Harari thinks that most of the population are, quote, hackable animals who need to be kept docile via drugs and video games?
[02:53:54.188 --> 02:53:55.690]  Yeah, that might be a worry.
[02:53:55.770 --> 02:54:02.916]  And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, what do we need humans for?
[02:54:03.196 --> 02:54:06.159]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[02:54:06.179 --> 02:54:11.643]   Beyond wage slave migrants to service Harari and his globalist buddies, Apparently nothing.
[02:54:11.663 --> 02:54:17.586]  At present, the best guess we have is keep them happy with drugs and computer games.
[02:54:17.906 --> 02:54:19.407]  We call this the metaverse.
[02:54:19.467 --> 02:54:21.908]  But don't worry, the elite really care about you.
[02:54:21.928 --> 02:54:27.010]  I mean, one of their biggest heroes literally said you're all useless eaters, but I'm sure he didn't mean it.
[02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:29.731]  Would constitute a new useless class.
[02:54:29.890 --> 02:54:32.289]  When I say that these are useless humans...
[02:54:32.289 --> 02:54:35.591]   Harari previously stated that voters don't know what's best for them.
[02:54:35.591 --> 02:54:38.890]   That the elite will soon be able to hack into people's brains.
[02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:41.989]  That there needs to be, quote, "an antivirus for the brain"
[02:54:41.989 --> 02:54:45.190]  to prevent people being infected with "fake news".
[02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:48.290]  That there is no free will or God. No heaven or hell.
[02:54:48.299 --> 02:54:55.242]  And that while the elite themselves will become gods via transhumanism, most of the rest of us will soon, quote, disappear.
[02:54:55.382 --> 02:55:02.904]  And to emphasize, this is the guy that the elite thinks is one of the greatest thinkers of the 21st century.
[02:55:03.004 --> 02:55:06.125]  But yeah, I'm sure they really have your best interests at heart.
[02:55:06.205 --> 02:55:07.786]  A new useless class.
[02:55:10.731 --> 02:55:11.632]  Well there you have it.
[02:55:11.692 --> 02:55:23.230]  Let's go to some final news stories here because the wave of Russophobia continues to sweep the globe, where Russian culture in a broad sweep is subject to cancellation.
[02:55:23.962 --> 02:55:30.005]  Headline, Britain's National Gallery changes name of 19th century painting due to, quote, current situation.
[02:55:30.065 --> 02:55:31.305]  Gotta support the current thing.
[02:55:31.786 --> 02:55:42.611]  The British National Gallery's changed the name of a 19th century painting by French Impressionist Edgar Degas from Russian dancers to Ukrainian dancers due to the, quote, current situation.
[02:55:43.031 --> 02:55:45.132]  Why did they change the name of the painting?
[02:55:45.492 --> 02:55:50.334]  Because one activist wrote an email whining about it.
[02:55:50.494 --> 02:55:51.395]  Yeah, that's enough.
[02:55:51.935 --> 02:55:54.918]  The activists described it as a micro-victory.
[02:55:56.079 --> 02:56:04.206]  Of course we had the previous cancellation of Dostoyevsky, who of course got cancelled in Milan University on Dostoyevsky.
[02:56:04.887 --> 02:56:09.731]  We've had pianists, we've had conductors, world famous, being cancelled.
[02:56:09.771 --> 02:56:14.956]  Basically their careers are ruined because they were born on a piece of land called Russia.
[02:56:15.586 --> 02:56:32.825]  We've had the world number one Medvedev, the tennis player, being asked to publicly denounce Putin, basically being ideological subservient to whatever the regime narrative wants at the time, very dangerous precedent to set, if he's allowed to compete at the Wimbledon tennis tournament.
[02:56:33.766 --> 02:56:37.590]  Meanwhile, Twitter bans ex-UN weapons inspector over Ukraine.
[02:56:38.194 --> 02:56:49.574]  This is former US Marine Corps officer Scott Ritter, who of course was instrumental in exposing the lies behind the weapons of mass destruction hoax, and boy did they target him for that afterwards.
[02:56:50.580 --> 02:57:01.994]  He's now been permanently suspended from Twitter, basically because he dared to challenge the regime narrative in terms of the Boca quote massacre that happened near Kiev.
[02:57:02.395 --> 02:57:04.517]  So now basically the standard has been set.
[02:57:04.818 --> 02:57:12.045]   If you dare go against regime NATO narratives, You are subject to cancellation and deletion.
[02:57:12.565 --> 02:57:14.947]  Meanwhile, Spotify announces Russia exit date.
[02:57:14.987 --> 02:57:20.230]  Yes, if you're Russian, you won't be able to listen to music on Spotify from next Monday.
[02:57:20.251 --> 02:57:21.531]  I was going to wrap it up.
[02:57:21.712 --> 02:57:22.952]  War Room is coming up next.
[02:57:23.073 --> 02:57:24.173]  Summit.News.
[02:57:24.132 --> 02:57:37.971]  Don't go away.
[02:57:38.042 --> 02:57:43.344]  We have a symbiotic relationship and there's been major supply chain breakdowns as you know the last few years.
[02:57:43.704 --> 02:57:50.126]  That's why so many products we've had to either discontinue them or reformulate them or just wait and wait and wait for them to come in.
[02:57:51.386 --> 02:58:10.333]   It was 11 months ago we put our deposit down To the US company that has a deal with France to get the patented special quail eggs that are fed a secret diet that in major even trials and studies have been proven to work better than over-the-counter antihistamines, but in a natural way.
[02:58:10.533 --> 02:58:15.677]  And finally, 11 months after I put down the money to get it, we were about to discontinue it and demand our money back.
[02:58:15.757 --> 02:58:16.378]  It came in.
[02:58:16.497 --> 02:58:20.377]   pollen block package here in the US specially fed quail in France. I
[02:58:20.377 --> 02:58:23.176]   discovered this a hundred years ago they're being fed a certain diet and
[02:58:23.176 --> 02:58:25.698]  people ate those eggs. The French eat a lot of quail eggs.
[02:58:25.698 --> 02:58:26.577]  A lot of people in Texas do it.
[02:58:26.577 --> 02:58:29.416]   But the point is that you wouldn't get allergies. Well ladies and gentlemen it's

[02:59:08.407 --> 02:59:12.051]  You're watching The American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:59:13.092 --> 02:59:14.794]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:15.134 --> 02:59:18.698]  This is The War Room with Owen Schreier.
[02:59:18.858 --> 02:59:22.963]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:59:25.629 --> 02:59:36.756]  When you went to InfoWarsStore.com and purchased the first in the three-part series of our limited edition coin release, you funded InfoWars into the future.
[02:59:37.436 --> 02:59:43.100]  We probably would have had a lot more problems and maybe not have even been on air here today like we are.
[02:59:43.760 --> 03:00:07.407]   If you didn't take part in that campaign and so we're kind of back to where we were then and we just launched part two in the Patriot Collectibles Info Wars limited coin series and that is the latest edition with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants The Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time.
[03:00:08.047 --> 03:00:10.168]  And you're seeing it on the screen right there.
[03:00:10.929 --> 03:00:14.291]  And so this is so great because it's a limited edition coin release.
[03:00:14.972 --> 03:00:16.553]  It will fund us into the future.
[03:00:17.173 --> 03:00:20.875]  And it's actually pure silver, .9999 pure silver.
[03:00:21.696 --> 03:00:30.582]  So you're actually getting something that has inherent value and can, you know, potentially even not just have the sentimental value, but the inherent value of being pure silver.
[03:00:31.892 --> 03:00:38.814]  And a lot of people think that the silver market is synthetically kept down, but we're not selling you here saying this is an investment.
[03:00:38.834 --> 03:00:41.095]  We're saying this is an investment in InfoWars.
[03:00:41.735 --> 03:00:44.396]  This is an investment in free speech.
[03:00:45.277 --> 03:00:52.099]  So get your one-ounce Tree of Liberty founding member silver rounds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:52.799 --> 03:00:56.784]  Or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and get it there as well.
[03:00:56.824 --> 03:01:02.451]  Sorry, I had to refresh my memory there for a second on the other website, patriotcollectibles.com.
[03:01:02.571 --> 03:01:05.735]  Either one, that's what funds InfoWars into the future.
[03:01:06.797 --> 03:01:17.870]   And obviously, We thought that the last silver coin was maybe the coolest coin you're going to find in a mint, but maybe it's this one with the Tree of Liberty on one side.
[03:01:18.010 --> 03:01:25.384]  And if you really get deep into the details here, you can see we put the Infowars hexagon logo deeply embedded.
