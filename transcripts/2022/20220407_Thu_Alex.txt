[00:00.000 --> 00:16.680]  An idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will
[00:16.680 --> 00:22.480]  and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election
[00:22.480 --> 00:26.000]  or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.480]  We have the technology to hack human beings on a massive scale, new surveillance technologies
[00:32.480 --> 00:38.440]  that are now deployed just to deal with this coronavirus outbreak.
[00:38.440 --> 00:44.360]  When it's over, some governments may say yes, but there is a second wave of corona coming,
[00:44.360 --> 00:48.600]  so we have to be prepared and there is Ebola and there is also regular flu.
[00:48.600 --> 00:52.960]  Why not protect people against that too with this new surveillance system?
[00:52.960 --> 00:59.840]  So the tendency would be to prolong it indefinitely, also it's the moment when surveillance goes
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.960]  really under the skin, governments are now not just interested in where we go and who
[01:05.960 --> 01:10.760]  we meet, but even in what's happening inside our bodies.
[01:10.760 --> 01:17.160]  It's Thursday, April 7th, the year 2022 under the host Alex Jones and I'm taping this in
[01:17.160 --> 01:18.160]  the morning.
[01:18.160 --> 01:22.000]  Hopefully, if our flight isn't delayed or there isn't any issues, I should be back
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.280]  in Austin around noon today for the second and third hour.
[01:27.280 --> 01:32.200]  Marjorie Taylor Greene reached out last night and obviously has had Jimmy Kimmel threatening
[01:32.200 --> 01:38.240]  her and saying people should physically attack her and calling her a clan mother.
[01:38.240 --> 01:40.520]  Serious dangerous defamation.
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.200]  So whether I'm back in time or not, the guest host, I'm not sure who the guest host is as
[01:45.200 --> 01:51.200]  of this morning, will be interviewing MTG on that very important issue.
[01:51.200 --> 01:56.120]  It shows how the left is just turning up the heat when it comes to violence.
[01:56.120 --> 02:02.240]  We saw Saturday Night Live deliberately talk about gang raping Roger Stone's wife who was
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.760]  battling cancer and just, thank God, got over it a few months ago.
[02:07.760 --> 02:13.520]  This is the ongoing scientific manipulation of the public to be violent towards those
[02:13.520 --> 02:17.760]  of us that are loyal, good, decent Christian, God-faring Americans.
[02:17.760 --> 02:23.040]  So look for MTG on the show, regardless, and again, if my flight's not delayed, there's
[02:23.040 --> 02:25.320]  some storms, there's not any problems.
[02:25.320 --> 02:28.800]  I should be there for the balance of the show, and then I promise I'm going to be doing some
[02:28.800 --> 02:34.360]  extra shows on the weekend, on Saturday and weeknights last week because it's such historic
[02:34.360 --> 02:36.080]  times are happening.
[02:36.080 --> 02:38.640]  World government is being announced out of the open.
[02:38.640 --> 02:42.120]  Everything we've talked about is basically coming true, unfortunately, but the good news
[02:42.120 --> 02:47.740]  is we know how to stop them together, and it's been your caring about freedom, your
[02:47.740 --> 02:53.960]  caring about information, your caring about the real world that has gotten humanity in
[02:53.960 --> 02:57.800]  the position to even be able to fight back, and I want that to sink in, okay?
[02:57.800 --> 03:02.920]  I don't tell you this just to pat you on the back or to butter you up.
[03:02.920 --> 03:08.040]  Do you understand that the listeners of Info Wars are recognized by the globalists, by
[03:08.040 --> 03:16.160]  the enemies of humanity, to be the most hardcore cohort of awake, informed, good people that
[03:16.160 --> 03:22.480]  are going to resist the horrible nightmare, transhumanist, human animal cloning nightmare
[03:22.480 --> 03:23.760]  that they're building.
[03:23.760 --> 03:30.880]  This system of dehumanization makes fictional movies like The Matrix, and books and films
[03:30.880 --> 03:38.000]  like Brave New World and THX1138 look like utopias.
[03:38.000 --> 03:45.400]  This is the dystopia of dystopias because it's a real scientific satanic run dictatorship.
[03:45.400 --> 03:50.480]  Okay, so again, I am paying a big price for fighting them, but it's well worth it because
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.000]  the price of submission is a trillion times worse.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.800]  It is infinity worse, and I'm so sad for people that have decided to join the system
[03:58.800 --> 04:03.280]  and work with it as it's here to basically call and destroy humanity.
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.040]  All the horrors, keeping babies alive and selling their organs, all the dehumanization
[04:08.040 --> 04:09.680]  is now going to come out.
[04:09.680 --> 04:13.160]  Everything hidden is going to be brought to light, and none of us are perfect either,
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.120]  but we are not consciously trying to serve evil and consciously working for a system
[04:19.120 --> 04:24.440]  that's anti-God, anti-human, anti-family, anti-woman, anti-man, anti-child.
[04:24.440 --> 04:26.920]  So this is a very important Thursday edition.
[04:26.920 --> 04:32.520]  Hopefully, again, I'll be back in the studio very, very soon, who knows, maybe in 15, 20
[04:32.520 --> 04:34.920]  minutes from now if my flight is on time.
[04:34.920 --> 04:36.760]  But regardless, it's a big broadcast.
[04:36.760 --> 04:42.400]  Please remember, infowars.com only gets out past the censors when you share it.
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.640]  Same thing with band.video.
[04:44.640 --> 04:47.760]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[04:47.760 --> 05:00.880]  Thank you all for your support, and let's intensify our efforts to free humanity.
[05:00.880 --> 05:09.160]  In December of 2021, Infowars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  Coin.
[05:10.160 --> 05:15.960]  It was sold out in 10 days, and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful
[05:15.960 --> 05:20.160]  coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[05:20.160 --> 05:25.760]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell
[05:25.760 --> 05:27.800]  out in 10 days again.
[05:27.800 --> 05:30.280]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[05:30.280 --> 05:35.320]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[05:35.320 --> 05:39.200]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots in Tyrants and more.
[05:39.200 --> 05:43.200]  Be the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[05:43.200 --> 05:45.440]  It's also at infowars.com.
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.760]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them, and as a founding member, if we're able to
[05:49.760 --> 05:54.880]  stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps
[05:54.880 --> 05:56.240]  us go to the next level.
[05:56.240 --> 06:19.520]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.
[06:19.520 --> 06:22.000]  Fair to the state of Utah, but it's not just Spencer Cox.
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.200]  Utah's junior senator, Mitt Romney, has also decided he's tired of representing
[06:26.200 --> 06:27.760]  the people of Utah.
[06:27.760 --> 06:30.840]  So instead, he's speaking for his neighbors in the state of California, where he lives
[06:30.840 --> 06:32.680]  a lot of the time.
[06:32.680 --> 06:37.640]  Less than a year ago, this is an amazing example, it's just June of 2021, Mitt Romney voted against
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.680]  the nomination of Contagie Brown Jackson to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
[06:41.680 --> 06:44.040]  Okay, he thought she wasn't qualified.
[06:44.040 --> 06:49.000]  Now this week, Mitt Romney announced that he is supporting the same person's confirmation
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.560]  to the Supreme Court, huh?
[06:52.560 --> 06:56.080]  She was unqualified for a lower court, but a perfect choice for the Supreme Court.
[06:56.080 --> 06:57.720]  How does that work?
[06:57.720 --> 07:00.040]  Here's Mitt Romney to explain.
[07:00.040 --> 07:06.080]  In the prior confirmation, I was concerned that she was outside the mainstream.
[07:06.080 --> 07:11.280]  And as a result of our meeting for an hour together and reviewing her testimony before
[07:11.280 --> 07:14.720]  Congress, I became convinced that she's within the mainstream.
[07:14.720 --> 07:21.520]  She's also highly qualified, intelligent, capable person, and I wish her the very best.
[07:21.520 --> 07:24.480]  Oh, so she's now in the mainstream.
[07:24.480 --> 07:28.240]  She wasn't less than a year ago, but now she's fully in the mainstream.
[07:28.240 --> 07:33.040]  So here's what it took for Mitt Romney to finally support Contagie Brown Jackson.
[07:33.040 --> 07:36.960]  He learned in the course of the Supreme Court confirmation hearings that she gave lenient
[07:36.960 --> 07:39.240]  sentences to child pornographers.
[07:39.240 --> 07:43.800]  Mitt Romney apparently didn't know that last year, hence the vote against her.
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.480]  Now that he knows that Contagie Brown Jackson has distorted sentencing guidelines to benefit
[07:48.480 --> 07:54.240]  key pornographers, it's a yes for Mitt Romney.
[07:54.240 --> 07:57.080]  That's the junior senator from the state of Utah.
[07:57.080 --> 08:00.720]  And as with Spencer Cox, this is not a one-time aberration.
[08:00.720 --> 08:04.960]  Reporter Greg Price summarized Mitt Romney's past few weeks this way, quote, confirmed
[08:04.960 --> 08:10.760]  Contagie Brown Jackson voted against repealing TSA mask mandate, didn't show up to vote defunding
[08:10.760 --> 08:17.840]  Biden vaccine mandate, accuses Tulsi Gabbard of treason for opposing the war in Ukraine.
[08:17.840 --> 08:19.600]  Amazing.
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.800]  So Tulsi Gabbard has betrayed her country in uniform, by the way, she's still serving
[08:23.800 --> 08:25.440]  in the U.S. Army.
[08:25.440 --> 08:32.480]  But BLM, BLM which torched American cities for nearly a year, they're not treasonous.
[08:32.480 --> 08:34.400]  Not according to Mitt Romney.
[08:34.400 --> 08:39.500]  Mitt Romney of course did take to the streets there and the first Republican had joined
[08:39.500 --> 08:42.400]  thousands of people that were protesting George Floyd's death.
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.760]  The Utah senator marched with a group of evangelical Christians and shared the photo of himself
[08:47.760 --> 08:48.760]  on Twitter.
[08:48.760 --> 08:53.680]  And Romney told the reporter that he was participating in those protests because he wanted to make
[08:53.680 --> 08:58.880]  sure that people understood the black lives matter.
[08:58.880 --> 09:01.840]  We need a voice against racism.
[09:01.840 --> 09:04.520]  We need many voices against racism and against brutality.
[09:04.520 --> 09:08.240]  We need to stand up and say the black lives matter.
[09:08.240 --> 09:10.240]  Oh, yeah.
[09:10.240 --> 09:16.720]  Mitt Romney took to the streets, probably the greatest line ever uttered on cable news
[09:16.720 --> 09:21.920]  and like all the great lines nobody laughed, Mitt Romney took to the streets to watch BLM
[09:21.920 --> 09:26.400]  burn down cities, shit people and defraud donors to buy six million dollars mansions
[09:26.400 --> 09:27.400]  in L.A.
[09:27.400 --> 09:29.760]  Oh, but guess who the traitor is?
[09:29.760 --> 09:30.760]  It's Tulsi Gabbard.
[09:30.760 --> 09:32.960]  That's what Mitt Romney is telling us.
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.920]  And Tulsi Gabbard is a lot worse than Tony Fauci who funded the production of a virus
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.400]  in China that kill millions of people.
[09:38.400 --> 09:39.400]  Is that treasonous?
[09:39.400 --> 09:40.400]  No.
[09:40.400 --> 09:41.400]  That's not treasonous.
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.400]  Not according to Mitt Romney.
[09:42.400 --> 09:43.400]  Watch.
[09:43.400 --> 09:48.400]  I do want to point out how much I personally and I believe the great majority of the people
[09:48.400 --> 09:54.200]  in our country respect you individually and professionally for the work that you do.
[09:54.200 --> 10:01.760]  You are scientists, not politicians, nevertheless you are being made subject to the political
[10:01.760 --> 10:08.600]  whims of various political individuals and that comes at a high cost which unfortunately
[10:08.600 --> 10:16.080]  I fear will lead some to want to participate in helping our government make scientific
[10:16.080 --> 10:17.080]  choices.
[10:17.080 --> 10:19.800]  That's what Mitt Romney learned.
[10:19.800 --> 10:20.800]  Back from the streets.
[10:20.800 --> 10:26.960]  So the concern here of course is democracy and that's a word on the lips of every concerned
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.400]  person on television.
[10:28.400 --> 10:30.560]  What about our democracy?
[10:30.560 --> 10:31.560]  Every day you hear that.
[10:31.560 --> 10:36.600]  So just a quick civics recap, democracy is a form of government in which elected representatives
[10:36.600 --> 10:38.440]  represent the people who elect them.
[10:38.440 --> 10:39.600]  They do what they ask.
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.240]  The people rule.
[10:41.240 --> 10:45.920]  So with that in mind and given our strong commitment to democracy, you have to wonder
[10:45.920 --> 10:47.600]  where Mitt Romney is coming from.
[10:47.600 --> 10:50.960]  Is he participating in a system called democracy because the majority of Republicans, people
[10:50.960 --> 10:56.880]  who put him in office, would like Tony Fauci to leave his job immediately, but not Mitt
[10:56.880 --> 10:57.880]  Romney.
[10:57.880 --> 10:58.880]  He doesn't care at all.
[10:58.880 --> 11:02.440]  Mitt Romney is not alone, of course, not as Spencer Cox.
[11:02.440 --> 11:08.440]  It turns out a lot of Republicans in red states serially betray their voters, give them the
[11:08.440 --> 11:10.520]  finger day after day after day.
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.320]  The question is how long will Republican voters put up with this?
[11:14.320 --> 11:16.960]  Pedro Gonzalez is one of the smartest journalists in this country.
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.960]  He joins us now.
[11:21.960 --> 11:26.320]  Meet your new Supreme Court judge, Katanji Jackson.
[11:26.320 --> 11:33.040]  In every single case involving child pornography, judge Katanji Jackson has been lenient and
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.280]  openly sympathetic with the perpetrators of child rape pornography.
[11:38.280 --> 11:43.560]  Christopher Michael Downs openly bragged about molesting his 13-year-old cousin.
[11:43.560 --> 11:49.200]  He was arrested for trading videos of child rape, including children as young as two years
[11:49.200 --> 11:50.200]  old.
[11:50.200 --> 11:54.600]  Judge Jackson gave him the absolute bare minimum sentence.
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.440]  Ryan Manning Cooper was arrested for having more than 600 images involving the rape and
[11:59.440 --> 12:04.920]  torture of children, including infants and toddlers, which is why the prosecutors made
[12:04.920 --> 12:10.760]  it clear that the case was on the more egregious or extreme spectrum.
[12:10.760 --> 12:16.680]  The judge Jackson disagreed and ruled that distributing images of infants and toddlers
[12:16.680 --> 12:20.760]  being raped is not especially egregious.
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.480]  Wesley Keith Hawkins posted videos of 11-year-old boys being raped by men.
[12:26.480 --> 12:32.440]  Jackson only gave him three months, sent him to a low-security prison, arranged for special
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.000]  protections, and apologized to him, telling him that she feels so sorry for him and his
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.400]  family and for the anguish that this has caused all of them.
[12:42.400 --> 12:47.680]  In explaining her light sentence, Judge Jackson argued for the child pornographer's future
[12:47.680 --> 12:49.180]  potential.
[12:49.180 --> 12:54.640]  Six years later, he was arrested again for distributing child rape porn, and Jackson
[12:54.640 --> 13:00.240]  resentenced him to only six months in a residential re-entry center.
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.480]  Neil Alexander Stewart was arrested with hundreds of images and videos of child rape while trying
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.800]  to procure children between the ages of five and eleven to rape them.
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.600]  Judge Jackson admitted that the felon was likely to re-offend, but still gave a light
[13:16.600 --> 13:23.680]  sentence, arguing that the current recommendations for child sex offenders is outdated and substantially
[13:23.680 --> 13:25.480]  flawed.
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.160]  Three years later, Stewart re-offended.
[13:29.160 --> 13:31.840]  This is how Judge Jackson got her start.
[13:31.840 --> 13:38.240]  In 2009, President Obama nominated her to Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission,
[13:38.240 --> 13:44.160]  where she helped weaken federal sentencing policy for child pornographers by arguing
[13:44.160 --> 13:50.680]  that child pornographers are not pedophiles, which is similar to how Hillary Clinton got
[13:50.680 --> 13:56.480]  her start when she defended a group of men who violently gang-raped a child and later
[13:56.480 --> 14:00.000]  joked how she knew they were guilty.
[14:00.000 --> 14:05.960]  It's also very interesting that when the biggest pedophile scandal in history broke,
[14:05.960 --> 14:08.240]  Judge Jackson was there.
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.960]  After WikiLeaks released the Podesta emails, millions of people were asking questions about
[14:13.960 --> 14:20.120]  a strange, coded language being used between President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and their
[14:20.120 --> 14:21.120]  friends.
[14:21.120 --> 14:28.000]  A code that seemed to reflect what the FBI says is secret code for pedophiles.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.680]  The whole sordid mess became known as Pizzagate, and when the feds clean-up operation ended
[14:33.680 --> 14:40.000]  up in the courts, Judge Katanji Jackson was there to help tidy it all up.
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.080]  I'm sure this is all just a coincidence.
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.940]  Just like it was a coincidence that the world's most infamous pedophile blackmail artist killed
[14:49.940 --> 14:54.320]  himself in jail while the guards were surfing the Internet.
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.320]  And just like it's a coincidence that Congress has paid out millions of dollars in court
[14:59.320 --> 15:03.200]  settlements that involve sexual assault.
[15:03.200 --> 15:09.400]  In some parallel universe, there may be an earth that protects its children from pedophiles
[15:09.400 --> 15:13.160]  and other child predators, but not this one.
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.360]  On this earth, we pay them taxes and sacrifice our children to them.
[15:19.360 --> 15:45.360]  Supporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[15:49.360 --> 16:03.360]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.000]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[16:08.000 --> 16:15.600]  Now the second coin, as we enter the last days of March into April 2022, is now being offered.
[16:15.600 --> 16:20.280]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins
[16:20.280 --> 16:24.840]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep Infowars at the front
[16:24.840 --> 16:26.800]  lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[16:26.800 --> 16:34.520]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree Coin.
[16:34.520 --> 16:36.560]  It is powerful.
[16:36.560 --> 16:42.160]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.960]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future, thanks
[16:47.960 --> 16:50.760]  to your support of this project.
[16:50.760 --> 16:56.520]  Get a historic memento that helps keep Infowars on the air and also gives you a real piece
[16:56.520 --> 17:00.040]  of history at 1776coin.com.

[17:07.120 --> 17:08.960]  year history.
[17:08.960 --> 17:13.880]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[17:13.880 --> 17:19.800]  are broken down and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[17:19.800 --> 17:24.680]  operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[17:24.680 --> 17:25.680]  their main move.
[17:25.680 --> 17:29.960]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[17:29.960 --> 17:32.040]  ever despite the censorship.
[17:32.040 --> 17:35.640]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure, pay for our
[17:35.640 --> 17:43.280]  own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money, so listen up to 75% off at Infowarsstore.com

[18:13.880 --> 18:15.380]  defenses.

[18:19.720 --> 18:23.040]  top of it, it funds the Infowar so that's the 360 win.
[18:23.040 --> 18:26.480]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[18:26.480 --> 18:32.440]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[18:32.440 --> 18:34.920]  loatium root and more.
[18:34.920 --> 18:36.680]  This product is incredible.
[18:36.680 --> 18:42.200]  Infowars immune support, exclusively available at Infowarsstore.com is funding the tip of
[18:42.200 --> 18:44.520]  the spear, the Infowars operation.
[18:44.520 --> 18:45.920]  It is a 360 win.
[18:45.920 --> 18:50.360]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[18:50.360 --> 18:53.000]  natural defenses and keep Infowars on the air.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.440]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[18:55.440 --> 19:00.000]  Take action now, Infowarsstore.com.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.360]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[19:01.360 --> 19:03.240]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[19:03.240 --> 19:04.240]  Welcome.
[19:04.240 --> 19:05.240]  Hello, Alex.
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.240]  Yes, Malcolm.
[19:06.240 --> 19:07.240]  All right.
[19:07.240 --> 19:09.240]  I will make this quick and real short where the other patrons can get on the line.
[19:09.240 --> 19:14.280]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[19:14.280 --> 19:17.000]  Supermell Vitality and Brain Force Plus.
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  Mix those two together.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.640]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[19:19.640 --> 19:21.560]  Supermell Vitality really, really works.
[19:21.560 --> 19:27.760]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so it has
[19:27.760 --> 19:30.720]  a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[19:30.720 --> 19:32.080]  It also worked quite well.
[19:32.080 --> 19:33.080]  They just aren't as strong.
[19:33.080 --> 19:35.080]  This is like a very fine wine.
[19:35.080 --> 19:37.480]  In fact, each batch is different.
[19:37.480 --> 19:38.480]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[19:38.480 --> 19:39.480]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[19:39.480 --> 19:42.720]  People are like, why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as
[19:42.720 --> 19:43.720]  strong?
[19:43.720 --> 19:44.720]  That's just how it is.
[19:44.720 --> 19:45.720]  It's how it works.
[19:45.720 --> 19:46.720]  So it's always good.
[19:46.720 --> 19:48.720]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[19:48.720 --> 20:00.680]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it.
[20:00.680 --> 20:13.080]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:13.080 --> 20:14.080]  You found it.
[20:14.080 --> 20:16.080]  The tip of the spear.
[20:16.080 --> 20:20.240]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[20:20.240 --> 20:48.000]  I hear people talking bad about the way we pass through.
[20:48.000 --> 20:57.480]  Long before the puppet Biden was able to steal the 2020 election, courtesy of the deep state,
[20:57.480 --> 21:02.480]  we warned you that we're planning to steal the election and that he would serve as the
[21:02.480 --> 21:10.920]  perfect placeholder for the third administration of Barack Hussein Obama, who was not a puppet,
[21:10.920 --> 21:18.000]  but a high level globalist operative meeting at the highest levels of the World Council
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.080]  of Governors, which is known as the Davos Group slash Builderberg Group.
[21:22.080 --> 21:24.800]  Builderberg Group is the secret arm.
[21:24.800 --> 21:30.000]  The outer extension is the World Economic Forum, and they're now bragging about that
[21:30.000 --> 21:31.000]  and admitting that.
[21:31.000 --> 21:41.040]  So when we saw Obama visit the White House yesterday, we see a classic illustration of
[21:41.040 --> 21:42.040]  this.
[21:42.040 --> 21:43.440]  The picture is worth a thousand words.
[21:43.440 --> 21:47.080]  This video, this short 13-second clip is worth a million words.
[21:47.080 --> 21:51.560]  You see the dignitaries and White House officials and government officials not wanting to even
[21:51.560 --> 21:52.920]  talk to Biden.
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.600]  Biden doesn't even know where he is.
[21:54.600 --> 22:02.400]  He's bumbling around the stage, and there is Obama, the real president, that everyone
[22:02.400 --> 22:05.080]  wants to be near because he actually runs things.
[22:05.080 --> 22:07.840]  This is so pathetic, but this is what the globalists have done.
[22:07.840 --> 22:13.200]  They want to blame their puppets, Kamala Harris is just as bad, with all the gas prices and
[22:13.200 --> 22:18.120]  the collapsing border and everything that's happening with terrible Afghanistan withdrawal.
[22:18.120 --> 22:23.160]  So that he gets the blame, and not Obama, not the Democratic Party, and not the globalist
[22:23.160 --> 22:24.160]  organizations.
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.680]  Now, here's another clip of Biden joking about starting World War III, and we'll hand the
[22:29.680 --> 22:36.280]  baton for the big kick-off of the transmission of Harris and Smith, and I, ladies and gentlemen,
[22:36.280 --> 22:37.280]  am in the air as we speak.
[22:37.280 --> 22:39.280]  She'll be back in Austin very, very soon.
[22:39.280 --> 22:40.280]  Stay with us.
[22:40.280 --> 22:41.280]  This fight is far from over.
[22:41.280 --> 22:42.280]  Here's the point.
[22:42.280 --> 22:49.560]  This war could continue for a long time, but the United States will continue to stand with
[22:49.560 --> 22:54.320]  Ukrainian people in the fight for freedom, and I just want you to know that, and by the
[22:54.320 --> 22:59.200]  way, if I got to go to war, I'm going with you guys.
[22:59.200 --> 23:02.120]  In other words, if I send us to war, it's you guys that are going to go.
[23:02.120 --> 23:03.120]  Welcome back, folks.
[23:03.120 --> 23:04.120]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[23:04.120 --> 23:08.840]  I'm Harrison Smith, host of the American Journal broadcasts every weekday, 8 to 11 a.m. here
[23:08.840 --> 23:10.960]  on infowars.com and Band-Aid video.
[23:10.960 --> 23:13.040]  I'm just sitting in momentarily for Alex.
[23:13.040 --> 23:14.600]  He is on the way.
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.680]  He should be joining us within an hour or so.
[23:18.680 --> 23:23.720]  Now we're supposed to talk to Marjorie Taylor-Green, but unfortunately Nancy Pelosi, it's up to
[23:23.720 --> 23:28.360]  her old tricks and is called for a vote on the House floor that Marjorie Taylor-Green,
[23:28.360 --> 23:33.960]  of course, completely preempts anything we want to do since she's needed there on the
[23:33.960 --> 23:36.880]  floor to cast her vote.
[23:36.880 --> 23:40.400]  We believe, yes, suspending normal trade relations with Russia.
[23:40.400 --> 23:41.760]  So that vote is going on now.
[23:41.760 --> 23:45.800]  So we're going to try to connect with Marjorie Taylor-Green, but she may be doing more important
[23:45.800 --> 23:51.480]  things like, well, trying to keep us out of the war in Ukraine, unlike most of the people
[23:51.480 --> 23:53.960]  in power other than her.
[23:53.960 --> 23:56.200]  In fact, here's the story at infowars.com.
[23:56.200 --> 24:01.720]  Pentagon says Russia-Ukraine war likely to last for years, if you can understand them
[24:01.720 --> 24:07.240]  through the drooling, through the salivating, as they are desperate for yet another endless
[24:07.240 --> 24:11.400]  war to enrich themselves and further their globalist schemes.
[24:11.400 --> 24:15.440]  Pentagon believes that the Russia-Ukraine war will turn out to be a very protracted conflict
[24:15.440 --> 24:17.560]  that's likely to go on for years.
[24:17.560 --> 24:21.640]  That prediction was made during a House Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, which was attended
[24:21.640 --> 24:25.960]  by General Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Defense Secretary Lloyd
[24:25.960 --> 24:26.960]  Austin.
[24:26.960 --> 24:30.480]  He says, quote, I do think this is a very protracted conflict, and I think it's at least
[24:30.480 --> 24:31.600]  measured in years.
[24:31.600 --> 24:35.240]  I don't know about decades, but at least years, for sure.
[24:35.240 --> 24:39.280]  But hey, maybe decades, maybe decades, maybe we can look forward to that.
[24:39.280 --> 24:44.040]  Of course, when you look at the other conflicts we've gotten into that share an awful lot
[24:44.040 --> 24:51.520]  of similarities with this conflict, such as Afghanistan, where we armed the Mujahideen
[24:51.520 --> 24:58.040]  that became the Taliban in order to prohibit USSR aggression in that country, only to later
[24:58.040 --> 25:03.720]  go to war with people wielding our own weapons, you can just wait until we are at war with
[25:03.720 --> 25:08.480]  the Ukrainian Nazis against our own weapons, or maybe this will just drag on for decades,
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.480]  regardless.
[25:09.480 --> 25:12.960]  It appears as though the people in power in our country, from the President of the United
[25:12.960 --> 25:19.280]  States to the Joint Chiefs of Staff to NATO itself, are desperate for this conflict to
[25:19.280 --> 25:20.280]  get worse.
[25:20.280 --> 25:21.280]  They're not doing anything to make it better.
[25:21.280 --> 25:27.200]  I haven't heard a single person suggest peace at all, even once, even a little bit.
[25:27.200 --> 25:32.800]  It's like it doesn't even enter into their mind that maybe expanding and exaggerating
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.400]  and getting further into war might not be the best option.
[25:36.400 --> 25:38.040]  It's like they don't even consider it.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.040]  They couldn't care less.
[25:40.040 --> 25:44.760]  There's still a lot to cover, and a lot of the lies about what's going on in Ukraine
[25:44.760 --> 25:50.480]  are coming to light, again two stories at infowars.com, they sort of go hand in hand.
[25:50.480 --> 25:55.840]  You have this, Twitter bans ex-U.N. weapons inspector over Ukraine.
[25:55.840 --> 26:00.000]  Twitter banned the retired U.S. Marine Corps officer, Scott Ritter on Wednesday, accusing
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.320]  him of engaging in prohibitive behavior by questioning the claims of Ukrainian authorities
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.360]  that Russian soldiers had massacred civilians in Bukha near Kiev.
[26:08.360 --> 26:13.120]  Twitter is best known as the former U.N. weapons inspector who doubted U.S. claims about Iraqi
[26:13.120 --> 26:19.040]  weapons of mass destruction invoked by Washington as a pretext for the 2003 invasion.
[26:19.040 --> 26:21.120]  So he was right about that.
[26:21.120 --> 26:25.560]  If only we'd listened to him back then, and now he's sounding similar alarms, and he's
[26:25.560 --> 26:27.840]  been kicked off of Twitter.
[26:27.840 --> 26:31.320]  Of course he has, because you can't spread misinformation on Twitter.
[26:31.320 --> 26:32.480]  That's not allowed.
[26:32.480 --> 26:37.600]  It's explicitly prohibited, in fact, unless of course it's disinformation that progresses
[26:37.600 --> 26:45.680]  the agenda of the globalists as the viral photo of the Russian mobile crematorium has
[26:45.680 --> 26:48.320]  gone just absolutely insane.
[26:48.320 --> 26:51.320]  It's a tweet from an eight-year-old YouTube video.
[26:51.320 --> 26:56.360]  A viral tweet that remains unchecked by so-called fact checkers claims to show a Russian-operated
[26:56.360 --> 27:00.360]  mobile crematorium in Marriapole, but the image is taken from an eight-year-old YouTube
[27:00.360 --> 27:01.360]  video.
[27:01.360 --> 27:06.600]  Whoopsie-daisy, the tweet was posted by News Outlet NEXTA, which boasts nearly a million
[27:06.600 --> 27:07.760]  followers on Twitter.
[27:07.760 --> 27:11.960]  The tweet has received over 7,000 retweets and almost 11,000 likes.
[27:11.960 --> 27:16.160]  According to him, tens of thousands of people could have died in Marriapole, and the cremation
[27:16.160 --> 27:22.000]  covered up traces of their crime, except that it doesn't, and it doesn't exist, and they
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.120]  didn't, and it's all fabricated.
[27:24.120 --> 27:27.240]  So interesting developments there.
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.880]  And when we get back on the other side, I'll show you a video of NBC actually just basically
[27:32.880 --> 27:37.240]  coming out and admitting the fact that they're not fact-checking even in the slightest the
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.200]  claims made by the intelligence agencies and the intelligence agencies themselves are admitting
[27:42.200 --> 27:47.520]  that what they're operating off of is not hard evidence, but more of speculation and
[27:47.520 --> 27:52.320]  more of, well, this is what we want people to think in order to progress our agenda,
[27:52.320 --> 27:57.160]  which by the way, has nothing even slightly in common with anything that benefits the
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.880]  American people or serves our interests even a little bit.
[28:00.880 --> 28:03.120]  Again, they're not even trying to make the argument in this case.
[28:03.120 --> 28:07.120]  At least with Iraq, they could claim that if he makes a weapon of mass destruction,
[28:07.120 --> 28:08.880]  he'll deploy it here in Ukraine.
[28:08.880 --> 28:11.040]  They're just like, shut up and go to war.
[28:11.040 --> 28:18.600]  Shut up and go to war and swallow down these lies that we'll use to predicate our actions.
[28:18.600 --> 28:19.600]  It's just absurd.
[28:19.600 --> 28:23.480]  But of course, we've been fighting this, and we as an info wars.
[28:23.480 --> 28:28.960]  I was in middle school at the time, but ever since the Iraq war, Alex Jones has been staunchly
[28:28.960 --> 28:33.400]  anti-war and has been demonized continuously for pointing out the lies that get us into
[28:33.400 --> 28:34.400]  war.
[28:34.400 --> 28:36.880]  As Julian Assange says, the people of the West don't like war.
[28:36.880 --> 28:38.160]  We don't want war.
[28:38.160 --> 28:40.000]  We have to be lied into it.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.920]  And that is the crux of the information war.
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.760]  You can force people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do up to and including war and death
[28:46.760 --> 28:51.680]  and destruction if you just give them information that leads them down the wrong path.
[28:51.680 --> 28:52.800]  It really is as simple as that.
[28:52.800 --> 28:55.160]  So the info war continues on the other side.
[28:55.160 --> 28:56.160]  Alex Jones is on the way.
[28:56.160 --> 29:02.120]  I'll be here for the next few minutes want to thank folks that got part one in the three
[29:02.120 --> 29:08.840]  part founder series at 1776 coin dot com or info or store dot com.
[29:08.840 --> 29:11.280]  And the second installment is the tree of liberty.
[29:11.280 --> 29:15.400]  Thomas Jefferson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants to coin
[29:15.400 --> 29:16.400]  I designed.
[29:16.400 --> 29:17.400]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[29:17.400 --> 29:19.680]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.800]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[29:24.800 --> 29:26.120]  we sold it.
[29:26.120 --> 29:29.200]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly.
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.840]  And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[29:32.840 --> 29:34.920]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[29:34.920 --> 29:38.600]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[29:38.600 --> 29:43.240]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[29:43.240 --> 29:45.320]  We have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[29:45.320 --> 29:49.480]  So as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[29:49.480 --> 29:52.400]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[29:52.400 --> 29:59.160]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776 coin.com.
[29:59.160 --> 30:03.720]  You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[30:03.720 --> 30:11.760]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[30:11.760 --> 30:16.440]  resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[30:16.440 --> 30:23.280]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever
[30:23.280 --> 30:24.280]  done.
[30:24.280 --> 30:30.280]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarsetour.com
[30:30.280 --> 30:33.480]  and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you.
[30:33.480 --> 30:38.080]  And so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified.
[30:38.080 --> 30:41.680]  Don't need me to tell you that at infowarsetour.com.
[30:41.680 --> 30:45.640]  We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now.
[30:45.640 --> 30:50.000]  These have been sold out for a long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix that's
[30:50.000 --> 30:54.480]  so amazing and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[30:54.480 --> 30:59.800]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at infowarsetour.com right now.
[30:59.800 --> 31:01.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[31:01.560 --> 31:05.000]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[31:05.000 --> 31:09.000]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.200]  I was born for this.
[31:10.200 --> 31:14.640]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[31:14.640 --> 31:19.680]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[31:19.680 --> 31:20.680]  of dollars.
[31:20.680 --> 31:25.040]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[31:25.040 --> 31:30.960]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[31:30.960 --> 31:31.960]  of charge.
[31:31.960 --> 31:36.760]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[31:36.760 --> 31:41.240]  Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[31:41.240 --> 31:47.560]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[31:47.560 --> 31:49.360]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[31:49.360 --> 31:53.640]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout

[32:09.640 --> 32:14.720]  defenses, your immune system, while at the same time, funding the info war.

[32:19.240 --> 32:23.680]  activity they're involved in, it is more important than ever to take the tools God gave us and

[33:11.680 --> 33:27.640]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:27.640 --> 33:30.000]  the mind of man.
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.320]  Thomas Jefferson.
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.120]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show.
[33:35.120 --> 33:38.440]  I'm Harrison Smith, sitting in for Alex for this first hour.
[33:38.440 --> 33:44.960]  He is on his way and will be here shortly, but unfortunately we are not able to have
[33:44.960 --> 33:49.360]  Marjorie Taylor-Green on right now because she has been called away to deal with a urgent
[33:49.360 --> 33:51.120]  vote on the House floor.
[33:51.120 --> 33:52.120]  It's going on now.
[33:52.120 --> 33:56.880]  You can see if you're a television viewer, suspending normal trade relations with Russia
[33:56.880 --> 34:02.720]  is the topic, it needs a two-thirds majority to pass, and the votes are now being cast
[34:02.720 --> 34:03.720]  and counted.
[34:03.720 --> 34:09.160]  We'll keep you up to date on that, but we'll talk a little bit more about this war and
[34:09.160 --> 34:12.280]  how exactly we are waging it.
[34:12.280 --> 34:18.480]  By we, I mean the American states, and by waging war, I mean just waging an endless disinformation
[34:18.480 --> 34:20.320]  campaign.
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.720]  It's really kind of wild how many stories out of Ukraine are just provably false immediately
[34:25.720 --> 34:27.080]  as soon as they come out.
[34:27.080 --> 34:29.440]  It's not to say that Russia isn't invading.
[34:29.440 --> 34:31.320]  Like this is the way the leftists will take it, right?
[34:31.320 --> 34:36.200]  We'll be like, well, the ghost of Kiev wasn't real, and the Snake Island thing wasn't real,
[34:36.200 --> 34:39.200]  and there's a lot of suspicious activity here, and this doesn't look like it happened.
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.240]  They'll be like, oh, so you're saying Russia never invaded Ukraine?
[34:42.240 --> 34:44.240]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[34:44.240 --> 34:48.640]  I mean, this is the way they take things.
[34:48.640 --> 34:50.520]  It's not our fault that you're a bunch of liars.
[34:50.520 --> 34:54.960]  It's not our fault that you are the boy who cried wolf, and now you're just slaughtering
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.580]  sheep in an attempt to convince us that the wolf is real.
[34:58.580 --> 34:59.960]  We don't believe you.
[34:59.960 --> 35:00.960]  It's not real.
[35:00.960 --> 35:05.400]  You're a bunch of liars, and psychopaths, and warmongers who are attempting to lead
[35:05.400 --> 35:10.240]  us into yet another decade-long conflict with absolutely no benefit for the American people
[35:10.240 --> 35:13.400]  you're not even pretending that there is.
[35:13.400 --> 35:17.080]  And they're actually acknowledging this tactic now.
[35:17.080 --> 35:20.240]  They're using this tactic on purpose and being pretty open about it.
[35:20.240 --> 35:22.440]  In fact, I want to go now to this video.
[35:22.440 --> 35:28.680]  This is NBC talking about the way that America is waging a disinformation campaign.
[35:28.680 --> 35:30.440]  It's an information war.
[35:30.440 --> 35:31.440]  It's propaganda.
[35:31.440 --> 35:32.440]  It's baseless.
[35:32.440 --> 35:33.440]  It's a lie.
[35:33.440 --> 35:34.440]  But it's good for you.
[35:34.440 --> 35:35.440]  Let's watch.
[35:35.440 --> 35:40.560]  The U.S. using intelligence to fight an information war and doing it to Russia for months now,
[35:40.560 --> 35:41.560]  and it's working.
[35:41.560 --> 35:45.280]  NBC News, National Security Correspondent Ken Delaney, and live in Washington.
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.040]  Ken, I want to start by giving people an example of what this is so they know what we're talking
[35:50.040 --> 35:51.040]  about.
[35:51.040 --> 36:00.080]  They're also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine.
[36:00.080 --> 36:03.680]  That's a clear sign he's considering using both of those.
[36:03.680 --> 36:07.840]  Ken, can you explain to our viewers what was going on there and what NBC News has learned
[36:07.840 --> 36:11.320]  about that claim this week from three different U.S. officials?
[36:11.320 --> 36:14.040]  Yeah, that was a great example of what we're talking about.
[36:14.040 --> 36:17.480]  That was based on declassified intelligence.
[36:17.480 --> 36:23.320]  But we're also told the intelligence wasn't very clear about what exactly was going on,
[36:23.320 --> 36:29.160]  and they decided to disclose it as a way of deterring Russia from doing that and putting
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.560]  the world on notice that this could happen, and that's what's going on here, the big picture.
[36:34.560 --> 36:37.560]  This is an unprecedented use of declassified intelligence.
[36:37.560 --> 36:42.560]  We've never seen this level of information warfare before from the U.S. government, and
[36:42.560 --> 36:47.440]  what they're doing is they're trying to preempt the Russians, get ahead of Russian disinformation,
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.000]  even mess with Vladimir Putin's brain, as one person put it, leave him off balance
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.400]  and try to show that the United States knows what Russia is up to and is going to get ahead
[36:56.400 --> 36:57.800]  of it.
[36:57.800 --> 36:59.800]  It's really rather remarkable.
[36:59.800 --> 37:06.520]  Another example was when they announced that Russia had gone to China to ask for help with
[37:06.520 --> 37:07.520]  getting some weapons.
[37:07.520 --> 37:11.240]  That hasn't come to pass yet, and it was almost a way of putting China on notice, hey, we
[37:11.240 --> 37:13.640]  know what's going on here, don't let this happen.
[37:13.640 --> 37:17.320]  So really interesting and unprecedented use of intelligence here, Alice.
[37:17.320 --> 37:20.960]  Yeah, and Ken, as you just said, not just intelligence here, unprecedented use.
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.120]  One U.S. official telling you it doesn't even have to be solid intelligence when we talk
[37:25.120 --> 37:26.120]  about it.
[37:26.120 --> 37:28.280]  It's more important to get out ahead of them.
[37:28.280 --> 37:32.720]  Putin specifically, before they do something, it's preventative.
[37:32.720 --> 37:34.880]  What else have you learned about that strategy?
[37:34.880 --> 37:38.880]  I'll tell you, I've learned all about this new strategy.
[37:38.880 --> 37:40.360]  So interesting, isn't it?
[37:40.360 --> 37:43.080]  It's interesting and unprecedented.
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.480]  Is it, though, what the American government lying us into war?
[37:46.480 --> 37:49.880]  I don't think this is as new of a thing as they claim.
[37:49.880 --> 37:54.400]  I think what's new about it is the fact that they're so open about this tactic that they're
[37:54.400 --> 37:55.400]  using.
[37:55.400 --> 37:56.400]  Here's the story from NBC.
[37:56.400 --> 38:01.840]  In a break with the past, U.S. is using Intel to fight an info war with Russia, even when
[38:01.840 --> 38:06.120]  the Intel isn't rock solid, even when it's completely made up, even when it's entirely
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.400]  false.
[38:07.400 --> 38:10.040]  They're using it, you know, no matter what.
[38:10.040 --> 38:11.040]  Isn't that great?
[38:11.040 --> 38:13.080]  Isn't that wonderful and amazing?
[38:13.080 --> 38:17.200]  Three U.S. officials told NBC News this week there's no evidence Russia's brought any chemical
[38:17.200 --> 38:18.200]  weapons near Ukraine.
[38:18.200 --> 38:22.600]  They say the U.S. released the information to deter Russia from using the banned munitions.
[38:22.600 --> 38:25.920]  Again, we've explained it so many times here.
[38:25.920 --> 38:30.320]  The New World Order really operates with two arms, the one arm through the government or
[38:30.320 --> 38:37.280]  even corporations, that's there to abuse and confuse and befuddle and abuse you.
[38:37.280 --> 38:40.640]  And then the left arm is the media to tell you why that's such a good thing and why it's
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.120]  wonderful and why you should continue to trust them even as they're telling you that what
[38:45.120 --> 38:48.800]  they've told you before turned out to be entirely false, made up lies.
[38:48.800 --> 38:53.360]  It's one of a string of examples, this article continues, of the Biden administration breaking
[38:53.360 --> 38:59.120]  with recent president by deploying classified intelligence, which when they say declassified
[38:59.120 --> 39:01.640]  intelligence, just read made up nonsense.
[39:01.640 --> 39:05.440]  As part of an information war against Russia, the administration has done so even when the
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.800]  intelligence wasn't rock solid, official said, to keep President Vladimir Putin off balance.
[39:10.800 --> 39:11.800]  We're going to keep him off balance.
[39:11.800 --> 39:12.800]  It's a good thing.
[39:12.800 --> 39:14.560]  We're messing with his head.
[39:14.560 --> 39:15.560]  It must mess with Putin.
[39:15.560 --> 39:17.160]  I mean, it's got to work, right?
[39:17.160 --> 39:19.680]  Putin's got to sit there going, they're just making stuff up.
[39:19.680 --> 39:22.720]  They're making stuff up and everybody's believing them.
[39:22.720 --> 39:24.480]  They have a free press there, don't they?
[39:24.480 --> 39:26.920]  Why aren't they calling out their own government on these lies?
[39:26.920 --> 39:32.600]  It must be incredibly confusing to Vladimir Putin to hear baseless lies be spouted by the
[39:32.600 --> 39:37.000]  United States government and then picked up uncritically by the United States media.
[39:37.000 --> 39:41.000]  It must be highly confusing and remember, they got called out for this.
[39:41.000 --> 39:45.240]  I think it was Jake Sullivan that was being questioned and I believe it was about the
[39:45.240 --> 39:50.840]  chemical weapons attacks in Ukraine that were imminent, that were coming up and there was
[39:50.840 --> 39:54.000]  a reporter from NPR or something.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.280]  It was a video not too long ago.
[39:55.280 --> 39:58.760]  I wish I'd grabbed it for this show, but I'm sure you remember because we played it on
[39:58.760 --> 40:04.040]  Infowars quite a bit, was the guy was going, yeah, but what is the source of this information?
[40:04.040 --> 40:05.320]  Why do you know this to be true?
[40:05.320 --> 40:08.000]  And Jake Sullivan gets really mad and he's like, I just told it to you.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.240]  I just told you that it's true, so it's true.
[40:10.240 --> 40:11.240]  I am the source.
[40:11.240 --> 40:12.680]  Well, the fact is there was no source.
[40:12.680 --> 40:17.560]  The fact is he got that mad and he snapped back like that because he was being called
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.680]  out on a lie because what they were presenting to the American people from the official spokesperson
[40:23.680 --> 40:32.400]  of the entire military behind the official podium was a lie, was a baseless falsehood
[40:32.400 --> 40:34.920]  that they were perpetuating with no evidence to back it up.
[40:34.920 --> 40:39.920]  So when the press demanded evidence, they got very snippish, they got very mad and angry
[40:39.920 --> 40:43.040]  that anybody would dare to question their dictates.
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.280]  Well, you were questioning it because you're known liars and you're doing it again.
[40:47.280 --> 40:48.440]  And it's not a small thing.
[40:48.440 --> 40:54.680]  This is the cusp of World War III we are teetering on right now.
[40:54.680 --> 40:59.080]  Maybe you want to be a little bit more circumspect about the information that you're presenting
[40:59.080 --> 41:01.160]  and the lies that you're telling.
[41:01.160 --> 41:05.080]  This article continues, multiple U.S. officers acknowledge that the U.S. has used information
[41:05.080 --> 41:09.520]  as a weapon even when competence and the accuracy of the information wasn't high.
[41:09.520 --> 41:16.720]  Yeah, it's just like when you have a little kid and their mouth is covered in chocolate
[41:16.720 --> 41:18.920]  ice cream and they're like, I didn't eat the ice cream.
[41:18.920 --> 41:23.400]  It's like, well, I don't have confidence that the accuracy of that information is very high.
[41:23.400 --> 41:25.400]  No, it's bull crap is what it is.
[41:25.400 --> 41:26.960]  It's a complete lie.
[41:26.960 --> 41:28.840]  You are just absolutely full of it.
[41:28.840 --> 41:35.600]  But I'm sorry, in deep state spy speak, it's the accuracy of the information wasn't high.
[41:35.600 --> 41:39.720]  Sometimes it's used low confidence intelligence for deterrent effect, as with chemical agents.
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.560]  And other times, as official put it, the U.S. is just trying to get inside Putin's head.
[41:43.560 --> 41:48.520]  No, you're getting inside all of our heads, we're all befuddled and bamboozled.
[41:48.520 --> 41:49.520]  Well done.
[41:49.520 --> 41:50.520]  Congratulations.
[41:50.520 --> 41:57.480]  Abuse us at will since you have us in this discombobulated and dislocated status.
[41:57.480 --> 42:02.040]  It's really unbelievably ridiculous, but of course, this is why they hate Info Wars.
[42:02.040 --> 42:03.480]  This is why they want us off the air.
[42:03.480 --> 42:07.040]  If they controlled all of the passages of information, they could get away with stuff
[42:07.040 --> 42:12.600]  like this, but we won't let them as long as we have a platform to speak out against it.
[42:12.600 --> 42:15.720]  Put us in this mission by going to infowarstore.com.
[42:15.720 --> 42:18.720]  The massive super sale is still on.
[42:18.720 --> 42:22.880]  It's been extended and you're getting 75% off some of our top selling products.
[42:22.880 --> 42:24.920]  And I can't get over the t-shirt sales.
[42:24.920 --> 42:28.840]  You're getting t-shirts that are of the highest quality you can possibly imagine.
[42:28.840 --> 42:30.280]  I mean, I still wear t-shirts.
[42:30.280 --> 42:34.480]  I bought six years ago from the Info Wars store and they've only gotten softer.
[42:34.480 --> 42:35.480]  They haven't faded.
[42:35.480 --> 42:36.920]  They haven't gotten holes in them.
[42:36.920 --> 42:38.440]  They are really the highest quality.
[42:38.440 --> 42:43.160]  You will be blown away by these t-shirts, especially the fact that you're paying in
[42:43.160 --> 42:46.000]  some cases less than $10 for these t-shirts.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.880]  I mean, that's less than you can get undershirts for.
[42:48.880 --> 42:50.360]  And yet these things are beautiful.
[42:50.360 --> 42:52.400]  They will last forever.
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.240]  And best of all, they support this program and everything we do here at Info Wars.
[42:56.240 --> 42:59.600]  We'll be back on the other side for more.
[42:59.600 --> 43:07.880]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[43:07.880 --> 43:08.880]  Coin.
[43:08.880 --> 43:11.160]  And it sold out in 10 days.
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.720]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[43:15.720 --> 43:18.960]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[43:18.960 --> 43:24.480]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered and it will probably sell
[43:24.480 --> 43:26.560]  out in 10 days again.
[43:26.560 --> 43:29.040]  It certainly needs to in front of operation.
[43:29.040 --> 43:34.080]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[43:34.080 --> 43:37.920]  being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more.
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.920]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[43:41.920 --> 43:44.160]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[43:44.160 --> 43:45.160]  It's amazing.
[43:45.160 --> 43:46.920]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[43:46.920 --> 43:50.520]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.960]  very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[43:54.960 --> 43:59.840]  So get your new Tree of Liberty Coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[43:59.840 --> 44:04.040]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[44:04.040 --> 44:05.440]  They financed major universities.
[44:05.440 --> 44:11.280]  They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of the New York Times,
[44:11.280 --> 44:16.880]  other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[44:16.880 --> 44:22.320]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[44:22.320 --> 44:26.400]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.280]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four-national daughter.
[44:31.280 --> 44:32.280]  My wife makes dinner a lot of pounds.
[44:32.280 --> 44:33.280]  But I like to make it as well.
[44:33.280 --> 44:34.280]  I love to make breakfast.
[44:34.280 --> 44:39.360]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[44:39.360 --> 44:43.840]  nutritive and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[44:43.840 --> 44:49.880]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[44:49.880 --> 44:50.880]  and coming together.
[44:50.880 --> 44:56.360]  We really are sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and turn
[44:56.360 --> 44:57.360]  us into lab rats.
[44:57.360 --> 45:00.360]  We cannot let this continue.
[45:00.360 --> 45:01.560]  So I did it.
[45:01.560 --> 45:03.680]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[45:03.680 --> 45:08.360]  I've been training probably not as much as they should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[45:08.360 --> 45:10.360]  and thank goodness for InfowarsStore.com.
[45:10.360 --> 45:16.480]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[45:16.480 --> 45:17.480]  to get going.
[45:17.480 --> 45:22.760]  Besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to
[45:22.760 --> 45:27.920]  keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy
[45:27.920 --> 45:30.760]  giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[45:30.760 --> 45:34.400]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Sorilis.
[45:34.400 --> 45:36.720]  I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[45:36.720 --> 45:41.360]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation
[45:41.360 --> 45:43.760]  support and extra flexibility.
[45:43.760 --> 45:48.320]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[45:48.320 --> 45:53.040]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, turbo force, that can
[45:53.040 --> 45:57.120]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and Sorilis can keep you
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.840]  moving and feeling great at any age.
[45:59.840 --> 46:06.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfowarsStore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20
[46:06.920 --> 46:13.080]  year history and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the
[46:13.080 --> 46:19.200]  supply chains have broken down and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[46:19.200 --> 46:23.840]  and paying for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the
[46:23.840 --> 46:25.640]  globalists making their main move.
[46:25.640 --> 46:29.880]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than
[46:29.880 --> 46:31.880]  ever despite the censorship.
[46:31.880 --> 46:35.440]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.320]  our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[46:39.320 --> 46:45.920]  So listen, up to 75% off at InfowarsStore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[46:45.920 --> 46:51.640]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films.
[46:51.640 --> 46:57.760]  Everything is 25 to 75% off right now at the biggest sale in our history at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:57.760 --> 47:00.160]  Thank you for your support.
[47:00.160 --> 47:21.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.600 --> 47:24.600]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones show, this is Harrison Smith
[47:24.600 --> 47:30.120]  sitting in for Alex Jones who is en route to the studio and we should be seeing him momentarily
[47:30.120 --> 47:31.120]  here.
[47:31.120 --> 47:35.000]  But you know I missed this line when I was reading the first time this article and a
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.640]  break with the past US is using Intel to fight an Infowar with Russia even when the Intel
[47:39.640 --> 47:46.120]  isn't even when the Intel isn't rock solid, even when we make it up ourselves.
[47:46.120 --> 47:49.760]  Yeah we'll go ahead and run with that.
[47:49.760 --> 47:57.880]  NBC News says of this tactic of using false information to saying it's true to lie the
[47:57.880 --> 48:02.360]  American people into war, they say observers of all stripes have called it a bold and so
[48:02.360 --> 48:08.200]  far successful strategy, yeah everybody loves it, they say quote, it's the most amazing
[48:08.200 --> 48:12.920]  display of intelligence as an instrument of state power that I've seen or that I've heard
[48:12.920 --> 48:17.880]  of since the Cuban Missile Crisis when they wanted to do Operation Northwoods and kill
[48:17.880 --> 48:23.400]  a bunch of Americans and blame it on Cuba, it's amazing, it's so brave, it's just like
[48:23.400 --> 48:28.520]  the intelligence agency like yes we are spouting misinformation and disinformation in an attempt
[48:28.520 --> 48:32.320]  to warp the minds of the American people and lead us further into war and the news media
[48:32.320 --> 48:39.800]  is just like amazing, amazing, how brave you are, how powerful, how incredible, it's just
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.440]  if it's, it's just never been more clear that our media is simply an extension of the State
[48:45.440 --> 48:48.680]  Department and the deep state in general.
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.880]  Now some interesting things, interesting series of events, series of headlines I'd like to
[48:53.880 --> 48:59.960]  run through here, again having to do with World War III and the deep state's desperation
[48:59.960 --> 49:06.880]  to embroil us in even more destructive policies overseas, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
[49:06.880 --> 49:12.160]  visit Taiwan likely to trigger China, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is scheduled to visit
[49:12.160 --> 49:16.640]  Taiwan according to media reports a landmark display of American support that triggered
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.760]  a diplomatic protest from Beijing.
[49:18.760 --> 49:22.960]  So Pelosi announced she would arrive in Taipei on Sunday, it'd be the first visit to the
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.800]  island since Newt Gingrich went there, at least first visit by a serving US House Speaker
[49:27.800 --> 49:34.000]  since Newt Gingrich traveled to Taiwan in 1997 and then China said yeah I don't think
[49:34.000 --> 49:38.400]  so lady, you're gonna go ahead and have to stay home, they say quote, if the United
[49:38.400 --> 49:42.760]  States insists on having its own way China will take strong measures in response to defend
[49:42.760 --> 49:47.640]  national sovereignty and territorial integrity, all possible consequences that arise from
[49:47.640 --> 49:51.040]  this will completely be borne by the US side.
[49:51.040 --> 49:56.120]  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said, Reuters reported.
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.240]  And then Pelosi got COVID, God darn it, darn it she was gonna go to Taiwan, she was gonna
[50:01.240 --> 50:07.000]  stand up against China, she was gonna flex America's might right off the shores of our
[50:07.000 --> 50:13.840]  most intractable political opponent but then she came down with the sniffles, darn it,
[50:13.840 --> 50:19.360]  dang it, she was totally gonna do it too but now she's not going to and it's not happening
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.320]  and she's got COVID, even though she's asymptomatic and even though she's apparently now holding
[50:23.320 --> 50:28.360]  a vote on the House floor, she, yeah, she's darn it, she's just too sick, shoot, dang
[50:28.360 --> 50:36.200]  it, well, oh well, do you regret now, globalist, do you regret purposefully transferring massive
[50:36.200 --> 50:43.440]  amounts of our power to the highly nationalistic Chinese government, are you wondering why
[50:43.440 --> 50:50.400]  you went ahead and did that, no, of course not, it's all, it's all by design and maybe
[50:50.400 --> 50:55.720]  she'll go anyway, maybe she'll just go anyway because that's what we need now is Ukraine
[50:55.720 --> 51:01.760]  2.0 with China as an adversary instead of Russia will drive those two countries close
[51:01.760 --> 51:07.640]  together will solidify and really empower the anti-American coalition across the world
[51:07.640 --> 51:12.240]  and once again, just like all of the measures with Russia, the ruble now like highest it's
[51:12.240 --> 51:17.360]  been in a very long time, right, the Russian economy kind of doing fine despite sanctions
[51:17.360 --> 51:23.360]  but we're suffering, right, we're experiencing total supply line collapses so we'll pay the
[51:23.360 --> 51:27.840]  price for the things that are done to other countries by our government and it won't hurt
[51:27.840 --> 51:33.520]  them in the slightest, it seems to only empower them, it would be like the people in DC were
[51:33.520 --> 51:38.120]  just incredibly incompetent and just failed at everything they were trying to do until
[51:38.120 --> 51:44.160]  you realize that what their aim is and what their goal is and what their professed, you
[51:44.160 --> 51:48.680]  know, ultimate prize is, is the collapse of the United States in which case it becomes
[51:48.680 --> 51:53.280]  pretty obvious that everything they're doing is working perfectly and they're very good
[51:53.280 --> 51:59.280]  at pulling this stuff off and of course, all of this is deeply intertwined, right, I've
[51:59.280 --> 52:04.440]  got lots of stories here about COVID, epoch times, memo reveals, State Department assessed
[52:04.440 --> 52:10.240]  in early 2020 that lab leak was most likely, was the most likely origin of COVID-19, maybe
[52:10.240 --> 52:17.680]  this was another one of their, their brilliant, astonishing, really just, I'm, you know, amazing
[52:17.680 --> 52:24.040]  uses of disinformation by the, by the spy state, see, they know that COVID was a lab
[52:24.040 --> 52:29.200]  leak and they just, they've hidden that for two years, probably for our own benefit, probably
[52:29.200 --> 52:34.120]  because, you know, of what, of what smart strategic geniuses they are, that, you know,
[52:34.120 --> 52:37.120]  we can't know the truth, they have to feed us lies to get us to do things that we wouldn't
[52:37.120 --> 52:41.440]  do otherwise because of how much they love us, right, obviously.
[52:41.440 --> 52:45.800]  But of course, all of this, again, deeply intertwined, it wasn't COVID that destroyed
[52:45.800 --> 52:51.840]  our supply lines, it wasn't COVID that caused massive inequality and consolidated so much
[52:51.840 --> 52:56.920]  control into the hands of a very few corporations while shutting down tens of thousands of small
[52:56.920 --> 52:59.200]  businesses across the United States.
[52:59.200 --> 53:01.840]  That was the policy of the government that did that.
[53:01.840 --> 53:07.440]  They used COVID as an excuse, but of course, the lockdowns didn't work even a little bit
[53:07.440 --> 53:09.480]  when it came to stopping COVID.
[53:09.480 --> 53:14.560]  We've been over this, we get this, but isn't it interesting, isn't it interesting how
[53:14.560 --> 53:20.240]  everything the United States government does seems to backfire in the faces of the American
[53:20.240 --> 53:21.240]  people.
[53:21.240 --> 53:25.320]  And just like with the lockdowns destroying the supply chain and bringing the food supply
[53:25.320 --> 53:30.760]  to the brink of destruction, it looks like our involvement and our actions with the war
[53:30.760 --> 53:37.560]  in Ukraine are going to push us right over that edge and completely destroy, not us,
[53:37.560 --> 53:41.640]  I mean, we'll be fine, but the third world will be totally screwed and guess where they'll
[53:41.640 --> 53:42.760]  go.
[53:42.760 --> 53:45.840]  Guess what's going to, guess what's going to happen next.
[53:45.840 --> 53:51.920]  We're going to collapse all of the wheat supply, all of the, you know, calories that the world
[53:51.920 --> 53:53.760]  needs to survive.
[53:53.760 --> 53:58.760]  And then when the shipments to the third world stop, we'll invite them all here.
[53:58.760 --> 54:00.400]  It'll be amazing.
[54:00.400 --> 54:06.040]  It'll be like the migrant crisis in Europe times a million all over the world.
[54:06.040 --> 54:07.760]  And I'm sure the globalists hate that, right?
[54:07.760 --> 54:08.760]  That's not their plan.
[54:08.760 --> 54:09.760]  That's not what they're trying to do.
[54:09.760 --> 54:14.040]  It's just unfortunate side effect of all the policies that they endlessly pursue, despite
[54:14.040 --> 54:16.800]  the fact that they know this will be the outcome.
[54:16.800 --> 54:17.800]  It's all a plant.
[54:17.800 --> 54:23.320]  Like if you, if you really think that all of this is not by design, I really don't know
[54:23.320 --> 54:24.320]  what to tell you.
[54:24.320 --> 54:28.040]  I don't know if you can wake up after two years of COVID, you don't have the slightest
[54:28.040 --> 54:29.040]  suspicion.
[54:29.040 --> 54:31.720]  You don't have a bit of skepticism there in your mind.
[54:31.720 --> 54:34.760]  Then I'm sorry, you're just not going to make it.
[54:34.760 --> 54:42.360]  Let's go now to this video, this is an astrophysicist explaining the collapse of the supply chain
[54:42.360 --> 54:45.360]  and the ensuing destruction that will soon come.
[54:45.360 --> 54:51.360]  Here it is 15% of the world's calories come from wheat.
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.720]  About a third of that wheat comes from Russia, Ukraine.
[54:53.720 --> 54:55.560]  Russia has banned export of wheat.
[54:55.560 --> 55:00.120]  The wheat spring planting season is like now this week and there's not a lot of planting
[55:00.120 --> 55:01.120]  going on.
[55:01.120 --> 55:05.960]  Not only is the current wheat supply in Russia, Ukraine blocked up and cannot make its way
[55:05.960 --> 55:11.360]  to countries in Africa and elsewhere, but the future planting season is now significantly
[55:11.360 --> 55:12.360]  at risk.
[55:12.360 --> 55:13.840]  And again, that's 15% of global calories.
[55:13.840 --> 55:19.840]  And I just to take a step back, the whole planet Earth operates on a 90-day food supply.
[55:19.840 --> 55:23.240]  Once we stop making food, humans run out of food in 90 days.
[55:23.240 --> 55:25.560]  And that's not just linearly across all nations.
[55:25.560 --> 55:29.320]  What happens is the most vulnerable nations lose their food supply first and the richer
[55:29.320 --> 55:34.080]  nations buy that food supply to secure their population's calories.
[55:34.080 --> 55:38.680]  And so you very quickly see a bifurcation happen where suddenly famine is a real risk.
[55:38.680 --> 55:44.560]  And we already have about 800 million people on Earth that are subsisting on below 1200
[55:44.560 --> 55:45.560]  calories a day.
[55:45.560 --> 55:50.720]  So this very quickly tips the bucket in a significant way in a number of countries that's going
[55:50.720 --> 55:52.560]  to be really awful.
[55:52.560 --> 55:56.160]  And that's just on the wheat supply and wheat planting problem.
[55:56.160 --> 56:02.480]  Yeah, it doesn't even get into the fertilizer collapse, the lack of energy.
[56:02.480 --> 56:03.480]  It's going to get bad, folks.
[56:03.480 --> 56:08.240]  We are about to see waves and waves of death, whether it's by starvation or whether it's
[56:08.240 --> 56:15.240]  by the riots that the food shortages will soon cause or by the endless migration into
[56:15.240 --> 56:17.920]  first world countries from the third world countries.
[56:17.920 --> 56:23.240]  Once they start to collapse, again, it's not a coincidence that all of this falls perfectly
[56:23.240 --> 56:25.940]  in line with the globalist agenda.
[56:25.940 --> 56:34.720]  It's like it's not a coincidence that China has taken over from America's economic domination
[56:34.720 --> 56:35.720]  of the world.
[56:35.720 --> 56:39.680]  It's like you always hear these people, whether it's Klaus Schwab or Joe Biden or anybody
[56:39.680 --> 56:45.560]  else going, well, China is going to be the next big central power in the world as if
[56:45.560 --> 56:51.120]  they're not the ones doing it, as if they're not the ones outsourcing the jobs to China
[56:51.120 --> 56:55.080]  and destroying manufacturing here in the United States.
[56:55.080 --> 57:00.720]  Something we deal with at Infowars, it's not natural consequence, it's not a hurricane
[57:00.720 --> 57:04.920]  that hits America that we all have to just buckle down and deal with because you just
[57:04.920 --> 57:08.320]  have to because it's this natural force that is out of your control.
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.760]  All of this is in the control of the globalist.
[57:10.760 --> 57:20.760]  They enact these policies knowing that this is going to be the outcome in a very simple
[57:20.760 --> 57:23.800]  problem or reaction solution paradigm for which they have the answer.
[57:23.800 --> 57:29.360]  And the answer is, of course, submission to them in total control by a centralized government.
[57:29.360 --> 57:31.560]  It's going to get bad, folks.
[57:31.560 --> 57:32.720]  It's going to get really bad.
[57:32.720 --> 57:34.920]  And don't say that Infowars didn't warn you.
[57:34.920 --> 57:38.160]  We've warned you for the last two years of where this was going to go since they first
[57:38.160 --> 57:39.160]  announced the lockdown.
[57:39.160 --> 57:40.600]  It hasn't been hard to figure out.
[57:40.600 --> 57:45.320]  It's actually been hard to ignore, and I don't know how people keep doing it.
[57:45.320 --> 57:46.680]  We'll be back on the other side.
[57:46.680 --> 57:47.680]  Stay tuned.
[57:47.680 --> 57:55.680]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com,
[57:55.680 --> 58:01.360]  or info.store.com, and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[58:01.360 --> 58:04.680]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[58:04.680 --> 58:05.680]  It's a coin I designed.
[58:05.680 --> 58:09.880]  I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[58:09.880 --> 58:14.960]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[58:14.960 --> 58:16.280]  we sold it.
[58:16.280 --> 58:21.960]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting
[58:21.960 --> 58:22.960]  over half of them now.
[58:22.960 --> 58:25.080]  I'd like to lose them out very quickly.
[58:25.080 --> 58:28.760]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[58:28.760 --> 58:33.400]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[58:33.400 --> 58:35.480]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people, and that's a big problem.
[58:35.480 --> 58:39.360]  So it was a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[58:39.360 --> 58:42.560]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[58:42.560 --> 58:49.400]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.

[59:50.960 --> 1:00:02.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:08.080]  Joe Biden's federal bunglers of injustice, the FBI and the federal prosecutors, once
[1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:13.920]  again fumbled their First Amendment violating undercover operations after misleading a federal
[1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:19.920]  court seeking unwarranted gag orders during a federal investigation of Project Veritas'
[1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:26.240]  ties to the alleged theft of a diary belonging to President Joe Biden's daughter, Ashley
[1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:27.240]  Biden.
[1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:32.560]  Politico claimed that the raids generated controversy in some circles because Project
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:38.600]  Veritas identifies itself as a news organization, and the use of search warrants against journalists
[1:00:38.600 --> 1:00:44.160]  and news outlets is extremely rare due to justice government policies and a federal
[1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:49.160]  law passed in 1980 to limit such investigative steps.
[1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:55.680]  After Project Veritas was raided Roger Stone-style, U.S. District Court Judge Annalisa Torres
[1:00:55.680 --> 1:01:02.560]  agreed to a request by Project Veritas to appoint a special master to review the info
[1:01:02.560 --> 1:01:08.920]  on their seized devices to ensure that prosecutors couldn't get access to their emails, their
[1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:14.480]  text messages and other records that might be subject to attorney-client privileges.
[1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:20.360]  Lo and behold, Project Veritas' attorneys have now learned that for nearly a year before
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:26.240]  the raids even occurred, prosecutors had already used gag orders within grand jury
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:32.360]  subpoenas and court-ordered seizures of all of the emails O'Keeffe and several Project
[1:01:32.360 --> 1:01:37.360]  Veritas colleagues kept during a three-month span in 2020.
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:42.960]  Project Veritas is just one example of the war being waged on those who wield their First
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:45.800]  Amendment rights in a bid to expose the truth.
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:51.040]  Recently, the EU president tweeted that the state-owned Russia Today in Sputnik and their
[1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:56.240]  subsidiaries will no longer be able to spread lies to justify Putin's war and announced
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:57.960]  a ban on these outlets.
[1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:01.000]  Say what you want about invasive Russian propaganda.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:06.520]  The censorship of RT in Sputnik cancels any dialogue from the opposing side.
[1:02:06.520 --> 1:02:12.340]  Meanwhile, Infowars faces down a Sandy Hook lawsuit engineered to set a precedent to cancel
[1:02:12.340 --> 1:02:17.960]  any news organization that questions the mainstream media narrative, leading to the inevitability
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:22.000]  that all dissent, even by individuals, will be outlawed.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.640]  They start out with demonizing me that I believe in a new world order and a global government.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:33.560]  And of course, just last week, the Davos Group met, announced world government planetary
[1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:34.560]  control.
[1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:42.280]  And the title of this session, are we ready for a new world order?
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:47.840]  And they're really thinking, with this lawsuit, they're going to outlaw questioning big events
[1:02:47.840 --> 1:02:54.360]  like WMDs in Iraq or Jesse Smollett or any of these things that have happened and that
[1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:59.760]  questioning these and looking at the evidence and information is a crime.
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:03.840]  But here's the big takeaway and I'll just admit it, I could have done a better job
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:04.840]  on Sandy Hook.
[1:03:04.840 --> 1:03:09.400]  Some of the anomalies that we reported on were not accurate and I admitted it years before
[1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:15.640]  I was sued, but the issue is, this is all about them being holier than thou and they're
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:20.080]  the arbiters of truth and they're the Democrats and they're the ones that love you and Alex
[1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:25.000]  Jones is the devil to distract from how the corporate media has been caught lying to people
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:30.320]  consciously about WMDs, the list literally goes on and on.
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.120]  And what's crazy is the public's basically totally woken up, not just here but around
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:41.600]  the world and nothing they're doing is reversing that, but they pick these weird neurotic subjects
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:46.800]  like January 6th where Alex Jones and Sandy Hook and they just obsess like a religion
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:52.640]  on that and meanwhile I'm here in Connecticut, everywhere I go I'm just shaking hands, black,
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.200]  white, old, young, old Alex Jones, but a lot of them are mad at me and they go, hey,
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:04:00.640]  we questioned Sandy Hook, why are you backing off?
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:05.520]  And these folks don't even get up in their big ivory tower law firms that the world has
[1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:08.760]  moved on from their BS and yeah, do I make mistakes?
[1:04:08.760 --> 1:04:14.240]  Yes, but I don't lie on purpose like the corporate media does on record.
[1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:18.560]  And so I had the impression watching the attack on Mr. Jones that this trial will be about
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:21.880]  something far greater than what happened at Sandy Hook.
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:27.480]  The trial is going to be about ordinary people's ability to say, I'm not buying it, I want
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:30.520]  to raise questions, I want to draw my own conclusions.
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:34.560]  But for those of us who miss the McCarthy era, I guess this president is intent on bringing
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:35.840]  it to us.
[1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:41.400]  But with new force and new power and new urgency, unlike anything we've ever seen, the federal
[1:04:41.400 --> 1:04:47.040]  government aided by tech overlords and a deeply propagandized media is yet again flagrantly
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:53.080]  violating and abusing First Amendment rights in order to satisfy the dictatorial demands
[1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:55.680]  of the creeping agenda of the New World Order.
[1:04:55.680 --> 1:05:02.960]  John Bown reporting, we are only offering three coins in the series.
[1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:07.600]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:15.400]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[1:05:15.400 --> 1:05:20.000]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.440]  of the fight against these tyrants.
[1:05:26.440 --> 1:05:34.120]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty tree coin.
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:36.160]  It is powerful.
[1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:41.760]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:47.560]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future.
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:49.760]  Thanks to your support of this project.

[1:05:56.080 --> 1:06:22.560]  of history at 1776coin.com.
[1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:26.640]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen, this is the second hour of the Alex Jones show, Alex
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:29.840]  is still on route.
[1:06:29.840 --> 1:06:34.560]  The problem is that we used to live in a first world country and it's not so much the case
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:35.560]  anymore.
[1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:41.240]  I'm sure you've seen the headlines recently about the backups at the Austin airport, it's
[1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:46.520]  like we don't have enough fuel, it's just endless lines, people just like abandoning
[1:06:46.520 --> 1:06:49.320]  their rental cars on the side of the road.
[1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:53.640]  You grew up maybe in a nation that was able to take care of itself where everything ran
[1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:58.000]  pretty well, where if you had a problem you could bring it up and it would get solved
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.840]  pretty quickly, like those days are over, those don't exist anymore.
[1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:07.760]  We're in a weird sort of anarcho tyranny setup now where the government has no reason and
[1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:13.440]  no desire it seems to fulfill any of their obligations but you will be held to the highest
[1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:14.440]  standards.
[1:07:14.440 --> 1:07:18.200]  If you mess up even a little bit, well now you're a domestic terrorist and you questioned
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:23.400]  us, prepared to go to prison, Austin airport running low on fuel is Texas capitol's latest
[1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:30.880]  growing pain, yeah, it's because of our growing pains obviously, just like how all the crime
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:34.080]  that we're seeing spiking across the country, it's probably because of climate change if
[1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:37.480]  I had to guess, it was anything, it's got to be one of those.
[1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:43.160]  Of course we know that COVID, well it may seem like it's over, you may be able to walk
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:49.960]  around now and see smiling faces and go into restaurants and actually sit down in order,
[1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:56.200]  like life is returning to normal and this is the loosening of the boa constrictor, right,
[1:07:56.200 --> 1:08:01.320]  it'll tighten again, it'll clamp down again, we will once again be under the strictest
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:07.000]  orders and it looks like Shanghai, sort of the testing ground, sort of a vision into
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:08.160]  our future perhaps.
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:15.800]  Here you see the lovely doctors helping somebody, it's for your health, these are fists of
[1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:20.000]  peace, oh they're all getting in on it, throw the guy on the ground, did you do something
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:28.080]  wrong, maybe, maybe not, who's to say, if you're a radio listener we are literally
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:36.440]  watching a man run away from like 12 people in hazmat suits as they savagely beat him,
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:41.440]  it's just, it's for your health though, it's because they care so much about you, they
[1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:48.120]  love you so much, now whether they're hitting him with a tree, what is going on, well what's
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:55.200]  going on is it's total biotechnocratic tyranny on every level, to the highest extreme and
[1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:59.920]  let's go to some more videos of this, let's go to the one titled, this is the future the
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:04.480]  elites want, we see an example of what's happening in Shanghai, let me go ahead and
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:11.760]  roll as V-roll, because they are essentially implementing the COVID passport like they're
[1:09:11.760 --> 1:09:15.040]  trying to do across the world and we'll talk about how they're getting to that, but in
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.600]  Shanghai you have to have a COVID pass, if it's green and you're free to go, everything's
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:23.840]  normal, if it's red however, you're going to be sent to a COVID camp, you're going to
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:29.280]  be sent to a quarantine camp, even if you're a child, even if you're just a little baby
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:32.920]  child they will rip you away from your parents and send you off to a quarantine camp, here
[1:09:32.920 --> 1:09:37.880]  we see all of the citizens of this country, this is you in the future America, this is
[1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.000]  where we're going, this is where we're headed, oh you're walking down the street, down on
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:48.000]  the ground, on your knees, show us your passport, oh you're red, get in the van, say goodbye
[1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  to your family, no scratch that, there's no time to say goodbye, you're gone, you're disappeared,
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:58.600]  it's over, really brutal stuff and I mean just, if you want to know what America's going
[1:09:58.600 --> 1:10:03.560]  to look like in the future, just type Shanghai into Google and see what we got, now this
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:08.880]  guy, and we can turn up the audio on this if we want, he's from Beijing and he's trapped
[1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:13.920]  in Shanghai, he can't get out of Shanghai, he's literally on his knees begging, pointing
[1:10:13.920 --> 1:10:20.280]  at his ID going, I just want to go home, please for the love of God, just let me go home,
[1:10:20.280 --> 1:10:25.880]  he sees appealing, he's appealing to the good nature of the state and he's coming up completely
[1:10:25.880 --> 1:10:33.720]  empty because they despise you and they want nothing but your submission, so the number
[1:10:33.720 --> 1:10:40.560]  of videos coming out of Shanghai right now is really astonishing, the brutality, oh my
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:45.960]  God I haven't even seen this one, here's the police standing around in a circle as the
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:55.080]  doctor here, the nurse in his hazmat suit is stomping on the head of a poor infected patient,
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:11:01.520]  for your health folks, it's all for your health, from Washington Post, China said its COVID
[1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:05.440]  strategy was superior but it's failing in Shanghai, I don't know, it seems to be working
[1:11:05.440 --> 1:11:11.480]  perfectly, seems to be working incredibly well actually, people are unable to question
[1:11:11.480 --> 1:11:17.640]  you, be beaten by doctors, have to be begging on your hands and knees just to go about your
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:22.800]  daily business, I think all this is working exactly as designed and here they are, carting
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:30.000]  away children, that's good, that's what we need, it's all about COVID right, even New
[1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:39.280]  York Times is sort of questioning this, high tech kidnapping here going on, there's a child
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:48.480]  in a full hazmat suit, I mean, it would be funny, it would be comical if it wasn't coming
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:57.640]  here, if it wasn't happening to real people, if it wasn't actual signs of really just brutal
[1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:02.840]  overreach by the government, from New York Times, Shanghai sees in COVID lockdown, posing
[1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:08.280]  test to China's leadership, residents in Shanghai, China's most populous in cosmopolitan city,
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:12.720]  in Shanghai, China's most populous in cosmopolitan city have responded to the government's pursuit
[1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:18.960]  of zero COVID with a rare outpouring of criticism, see it's a rare outpouring of criticism because
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:24.320]  you're not allowed to criticize them, yes it's very rare to have criticism when you
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:30.040]  ban criticism, that's what the tyrants are figuring out, parents have organized petitions
[1:12:30.040 --> 1:12:35.080]  employing the government not to separate children infected with coronavirus from their families,
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:39.280]  parents have determined, have demanded to speak with higher ups about shoddy conditions at
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:43.600]  isolation facilities, residents have confronted officials over containment policies that they
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:50.960]  see as unfair or inhumane, then shared recordings of those arguments online.
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:58.600]  So I guess in a way it's sort of a double-edged sword, right, on one hand we are staring at
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:06.440]  a horrific dystopian hellish nightmare that is in place right now on the planet earth,
[1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:11.920]  like it's happening, this is taking place and nobody in America seems to be against
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:17.480]  this, right, if you take a kidnap victim away from their kidnapper on the southern border
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.560]  they will scream and cry that you're separating children from their parents, but oh when it
[1:13:21.560 --> 1:13:25.840]  comes to COVID, you take the kids, take the kids away from their parents, isolate them
[1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:30.400]  in a government facility and do with them what you will, maybe steal their organs, y'all
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:35.280]  read that article recently, cutting out hearts to kill people in China, just utterly brutal,
[1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:41.520]  right, and that's on one hand, on the other hand at a certain point you cannot hold humanity
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:47.600]  down like this, even people in China who are so conditioned with the social credit score
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:53.100]  and the brutal communist tactics are not standing for this, they're fighting back against it
[1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:59.600]  and the grip is slipping, the more they squeeze the more the people of Shanghai are slipping
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:04.920]  out of their grip, but they're using again just the most dystopian tactics possible from
[1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:09.840]  Business Insider for insider.com, Shanghai is flying drones over district to tell citizens
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:15.680]  under lockdown to, quote, curb your soul's desire for freedom and comply with COVID-19
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:22.000]  restrictions, oh please, please destroy your soul for us, here you have the drone, let's
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:26.800]  pull the audio up on this, so what was happening here is residents in Shanghai, since they are
[1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:31.760]  forbidden from going outside, forbidden from leaving their abodes, they're instead opening
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:39.000]  windows and going on their balconies and singing in protest, and so then China sends
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:45.760]  out a flashing drone with a large loudspeaker to demand people go inside and, quote, curb
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:52.920]  your soul's desire for freedom, replace it with your soul's desire to conform to the
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:59.000]  demands of the state, I'm telling you, I've literally never seen anything like what's
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:04.600]  happening in Shanghai, and it is almost certainly coming here, did we have one more video I
[1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:10.280]  wanted to go to or did we get to all of them, I think that may be all of them, that should
[1:15:10.280 --> 1:15:17.600]  be enough, right, drones flying around yelling at people to shut their windows and stop seeing
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:23.000]  and to curb their soul's demand for freedom, being able to demand that you take out your
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:27.960]  phone at a moment's notice, get on your knees and present to them your movement passport
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:33.680]  and should it flash red haul you off in a van to a quarantine camp because it's all for
[1:15:33.680 --> 1:15:39.960]  your safety, right, they're pushing the limits here folks, this may be a beta test, that
[1:15:39.960 --> 1:15:44.880]  may be what's happening here, is there they've chosen one city to go how far can we push
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:51.240]  it before we export these tactics to the wider world, COVID is not over folks, it's just
[1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:58.520]  getting started and the dystopia is coming.
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:02.280]  We are only offering three coins in the series.

[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:19.200]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again, because these are historic coins
[1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:23.460]  and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the
[1:16:23.460 --> 1:16:25.720]  front lines of the fight against these tyrants.

[1:16:58.320 --> 1:17:02.880]  You know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars
[1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:10.960]  is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty, as the logo of human populist
[1:17:10.960 --> 1:17:18.680]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:22.720]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:29.440]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at infowarstore.com

[1:18:12.720 --> 1:18:17.800]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[1:18:17.800 --> 1:18:22.200]  that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:27.840]  million views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:33.680]  able to post their content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:40.160]  a catch-22. Info wars and Band-Aid video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human
[1:18:40.160 --> 1:18:45.480]  liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:49.920]  a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale in
[1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:54.960]  info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75% off getting

[1:19:12.680 --> 1:19:17.640]  that we are now under a world government. They have a summit taking place right now
[1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:23.760]  in Dubai titled world government summit and they are announcing incredible tyranny. Everything
[1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:28.760]  we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off air. Ladies
[1:19:28.760 --> 1:19:34.240]  and gentlemen we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now. In
[1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:40.520]  our 28 years all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and

[1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:50.160]  do you imagine being anywhere else right now? Where else would I rather be? This is the
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:55.640]  crux of the battle. I'm in the middle of the crucible right now in the most epic battle

[1:22:18.840 --> 1:22:23.000]  it through today before selling all of them out but make sure to get yours now at infowarser.com
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:30.240]  we really do appreciate it and again we're here to tell you tomorrow's news today COVID
[1:22:30.240 --> 1:22:35.520]  has not gone anywhere in fact it is almost certainly coming back pretty soon and as right
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:41.840]  side Fred posts this screenshot from Good Morning Britain. COVID is everywhere and it's
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:47.840]  anything and you need to be scared of just literally anything. They have COVID's nine
[1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:56.080]  new symptoms and they include shortness of breath, feeling tired, aching body, headache,
[1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:01.580]  sore throat, blocked or running nose, lack of appetite, diarrhea, or feeling sick or
[1:23:01.580 --> 1:23:08.640]  being sick. That's right folks if you're sick or feeling sick or if you're just not hungry
[1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:14.400]  maybe you have a sore throat if you're just tired that's COVID folks you need to lock
[1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:20.280]  down immediately. It's just absurd but again they're keeping this you know just pump it
[1:23:20.280 --> 1:23:25.680]  up every once in a while keep it in people's minds keep it in the forefront of their awareness
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:34.120]  just keep them ready for the next big whatever variant they're going to come up with and
[1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:42.880]  of course all of this psychological operation of COVID is towards a single goal which is
[1:23:42.880 --> 1:23:51.920]  global government through the biotechnocratic control of our very financial systems. Now
[1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:55.760]  there is a bit of good news I do have one one little data point of good news and that
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:01.360]  is that mandatory vaccines for people 60 and over has been defeated in Germany. They were
[1:24:01.360 --> 1:24:08.640]  trying to mandate the vaccines the fourth booster shot I believe for anybody 60 or over
[1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:12.640]  and that has been defeated as of this morning in the German parliament so that's good that's
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:17.440]  nice and you also have this European health agency say it's too early for second boosters
[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:22.720]  in most people so just wait a little bit just wait a little bit the booster will come it'll
[1:24:22.720 --> 1:24:28.600]  be here it'll be there for you we already approved it here of course it was it was an easy thing
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:35.080]  to approve it once you silenced the experts the FDA in improving their newest boost booster
[1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:41.000]  didn't even ask the experts in fact they passed the booster they'd approved the booster before
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:45.560]  they even brought them in the article I believe it's from them for wars said you know basically
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:51.480]  this is like asking lawyers present a case for a judge who had already issued a ruling
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:58.520]  of guilty or not guilty so they approved the booster they allowed the booster and then
[1:24:58.520 --> 1:25:02.840]  they asked the experts about the booster and then they ignored what the experts said but
[1:25:02.840 --> 1:25:08.840]  here's a very interesting story from epoch times from yesterday memo reveals state department
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:14.360]  assessed in early 2020 that a lab leak was the most likely origin origin of COVID-19 a
[1:25:14.360 --> 1:25:18.200]  newly released memo from the US State Department reveals that government official knew very
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:24.000]  early on in the COVID pandemic that it likely originated at a lab in Wuhan China that memo
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:29.920]  dated April 2020 suggests that out of five possible origins for COVID a lab leak was
[1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:35.520]  by far the most likely the memo also yet also suggested that alternative theories had been
[1:25:35.520 --> 1:25:41.600]  introduced to prevent a lab leak from being investigated the memo which focus almost entirely
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:45.440]  on the likelihood of a lab leak contains a large amount of information that wasn't known publicly
[1:25:45.440 --> 1:25:52.000]  at the time it was written well you know it was known publicly it was just censored endlessly
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.640]  it was just that if you tried to tell the truth about what was going on with COVID you would
[1:25:56.640 --> 1:26:00.400]  be kicked off of the internet and if you were a doctor you might have your license pulled
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:06.400]  and if you were a broadcaster you might be fired from your job and if you were anybody you would
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:16.320]  be ridiculed by the lemmings in our country that will mindlessly repeat whatever lies that they're
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:21.360]  told although a lab leak is now widely accepted as a likely origin for the virus when the memo
[1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:25.600]  was written a concerted effort was underway to discredit that possibility and I remember this I'm
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:31.680]  sure info warriors out there had the same experience early on in the pandemic I mean it was an IQ
[1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:37.280]  test right the pandemic is an IQ test when they present to you just like I'm sure if you're I'm
[1:26:37.280 --> 1:26:42.000]  sure you've seen the the skit during the the breaks right it was like well you got two options here
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:47.520]  it came from right here and within this little circle of you know ground zero for COVID you have
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:56.000]  a farmers market and you have a level four bio weapons lab with doing experiments on gain a
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:02.640]  function research with coronaviruses that has a history of security faults and it's one of those
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.600]  it's either the farmers market or it's the bio weapons lab which one do you think it came out of
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:12.400]  and most people in America failed this very simple test they went oh that farmers market sounds
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:18.480]  dangerous that farmers market sounds like it might be a hotbed of viruses I'll go with that
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:23.040]  and I remember early on in the pandemic you know just knowing this just being aware this
[1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:27.120]  this had taken place the videos on band-aid video you can see me in front of the White House
[1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:34.400]  on January 20th 2020 right is that what it was 2019 my god my years are getting all mixed up
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.480]  2020 yeah okay because for some reason I was thinking January 6th was 2020
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:45.280]  yeah so January 2020 before the word COVID or coronavirus had even made its appearance
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:53.120]  in the mainstream media info wars was reporting not only that COVID was spreading and that we
[1:27:53.120 --> 1:27:56.480]  should be doing things to prevent it from getting to these shores we were also pointing out that the
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.440]  likely source was the lab leak so early on you know talking to friends and going yeah it probably
[1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:05.360]  came from a lab and they're just like that's conspiracy theory no that's conspiracy theory so
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:11.280]  it's like wait you didn't even know COVID existed five minutes ago I've known for a month and now
[1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:16.880]  you're telling me it's conspiracy theory that it came from a lab that it most definitely came from
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:24.560]  you really just have to be sort of you really kind of have to admire the control that the
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:30.800]  mainstream media has over people's minds where it can be so obvious that the origin of this virus
[1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:40.000]  with its manufactured fear and cleavage sites and its you know DNA profile that dates back as far as
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:47.440]  2016 with the Moderna uh trademarked virus that before they even know about it they know that
[1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:54.640]  the lab leak theory was a conspiracy what do those people think now I really have to wonder we'll be
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:29:06.240]  right back in December of 2021 info wars offered the first in a three-part series the 1776 anti-
[1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:12.720]  tyrant coin and it sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original

[1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:45.360]  we would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems so it was a limited edition

[1:32:02.880 --> 1:32:08.240]  this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communist well that's where some of the
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:13.520]  best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:17.680]  Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:21.520]  communist but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:25.120]  and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so i actually buy
[1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:28.800]  this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:33.680]  up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50 percent more per pound and i just
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:37.600]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:45.440]  from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm not gonna tell you a little story um we had like

[1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:05.680]  authorities come stomping in it's just it's it's insane i would understand it if this was like the

[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:51.200]  you know the the driver is willing the foot is on the gas pressing the pedal to the floor
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:54.800]  it's just whether or not we have gas in the tank that will determine whether we get there
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:36:02.080]  so please help us out reform our supply line at infowarstore.com we really do appreciate it more
[1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:07.760]  more than we can possibly say let's get back to this story from the epoch times memo reveals state
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:13.680]  department assessed in early 2020 that the lab leak was most likely the origin of COVID-19 according
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.000]  to the newly released memo the state department knew as of April 2020 that the central issue
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:21.920]  surrounding an obsession with collecting and testing a massive amount of virus carrying bats
[1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:26.800]  on the part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology and China's Wuhan located center for disease control
[1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:30.960]  and prevention state department noted that the lab testing of the earliest known patient at the
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:37.120]  Wuhan central hospital in December 2019 determined the virus was a quote bat SARS like coronavirus
[1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:40.960]  at the time this patient was tested the communist party in china had not disclosed that there was
[1:36:40.960 --> 1:36:46.160]  a problem at all and when they finally acknowledged an outbreak they initially blamed it on pneumonia
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:50.880]  it was only at the end of january that the ccp finally started admitting the january 19 was
[1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.520]  caused by a new virus that was transmitted between humans by that time the virus had already been
[1:36:55.520 --> 1:37:00.400]  seated across the globe and any chance at suppression had been a loss had been lost it was
[1:37:00.400 --> 1:37:04.800]  during that same time period that the director of the national institute of allergen infestious
[1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:10.160]  diseases dr anthony Fauci was made aware of the virus's likely origin having been told by a group
[1:37:10.160 --> 1:37:14.320]  of scientists whom he was funding that there was a high probability that the virus was engineered
[1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:20.720]  and then he went on tv and lied to us continuously and called us conspiracy theorists and wrote
[1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:28.800]  letters to popular scientific publications to lie to lie to hide the truth hide the reality
[1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:36.560]  and in order to confound the american people and allow them to act like this was all just a reaction
[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:41.600]  to something that naturally occurred nothing about this was natural not the reaction not the
[1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:47.200]  creation and not the fact that event 201 was held though just a month or so before it came out
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:52.080]  again if you if you can't have some some bit of skepticism in you after these two years
[1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:58.000]  i dive i have a bridge to sell you it's a wonderful bridge for a million dollars send
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.480]  your checks now because i'll send you to the bridge momentarily like you really have to
[1:38:02.480 --> 1:38:15.040]  be that stupid you really do it's just insane it's just absolutely wild and uh and it's really
[1:38:15.040 --> 1:38:23.040]  funny that we weren't allowed to talk about this and that people actually like went along with it
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:28.480]  and that like how many bio labs do we fund right just relating this back to what we were talking
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:34.080]  about earlier with the ukrainian bio labs where we have like a dozen bio labs that we fund with
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:39.520]  just tens of millions of dollars from american taxpayers we have labs in china and we have
[1:38:39.520 --> 1:38:44.400]  labs and just everywhere else in the world right there's just millions of our dollars are pouring
[1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:50.000]  into and of course we look at that and we go oh you're doing bio weapons research you're you're
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:56.640]  up to nefarious stuff that's just no good for anybody they go no absolutely not no the only
[1:38:56.640 --> 1:39:02.480]  reason that all of these labs exist is for one purpose it's to identify and prevent emerging
[1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:08.400]  infectious diseases it's like okay so uh so where are where were you where where were you what
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:14.320]  what were you doing when there was a new infectious disease that was spreading for months and months
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:20.800]  and months i mean maybe it was just because because we're at info wars and we're tuned into this sort
[1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:26.400]  of stuff but for the entire month of january and during the first outbreak of covid 19
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:33.200]  like we're watching youtube streams of people going through news from china you could go on four
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:39.600]  chan and see entire threads right corona chan there were comics of of this personified corona virus
[1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:43.280]  that people were making jokes out of like everybody knew this was happening the mainstream media
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:48.800]  must have missed this somehow they must have just completely ignored all of these warning signs somehow
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:56.000]  all of these labs that we fund to be our outpost to identify the emerging infectious diseases they
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.400]  were all just blind to this somehow a bunch of dudes on four chan figured it out but they couldn't
[1:40:00.400 --> 1:40:06.000]  they missed this i mean it's ridiculous so it's like why are we funding these labs if they don't
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:12.720]  do the one thing they're supposed to do because they do do that and then they hide it right so
[1:40:12.720 --> 1:40:18.400]  59 labs around the world handle the deadliest pathogens only a quarter score high on safety
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:24.800]  funded by your tax dollars and carried out by the very same people that put us in the lockdown
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:31.840]  destroyed the economy centralized so much wealth and power throughout the entire pandemic
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:39.200]  and they're not giving it up and it's not going away g20 discuss universal vaccine passport and
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:46.080]  verifier assuming the presidency in the upcoming g20 summit indonesia has begun health working group
[1:40:46.080 --> 1:40:54.880]  meeting series which began on the 28th and 30th of march 2022 in indonesia they seek to harmonize
[1:40:54.880 --> 1:40:59.360]  safe travel procedures worldwide especially the recognition of cobin 19 vaccine certificates
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:04.880]  in the wake of the devastating pandemic that ravaged countries across the globe the hwg meeting was
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:09.440]  aimed to foster a dialogue in the health sector between participating countries and to synchronize
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:16.480]  global health protocols just like how the event 201 organization was held to train people how to
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:22.080]  respond to the outbreak of an infectious disease out of wuhan china that was a coronavirus they
[1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:26.880]  knew all of the details they had it all planned out and what did they plan they planned how to
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:35.040]  control the media how to control the discussion about the outbreak how to control vaccine skeptics
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:40.480]  skeptics and how to silence them that's what they planned that's what they had in place before the
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:47.520]  virus actually hit us and here from truth talk dot uk the nhs cobin 19 app the little app that
[1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:55.440]  doesn't go away oh you thought that was temporary i'm sorry you i'm sorry you thought that was going
[1:41:55.440 --> 1:42:01.840]  away at some point why would that go away why would they release you from the trap once you'd fallen
[1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:09.360]  for it it's like uh reading the mice newspaper and it's like the cheese is a trap it's like yeah we
[1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:15.600]  know we know it's a big fat trap there to kill you and you fell for it and now you're surprised
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:19.920]  you're surprised apparently has recently been revealed that the uk health agency health security
[1:42:19.920 --> 1:42:26.720]  agency i'm sorry the health security agency has been awarded a 2.46 million pound contract
[1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:32.800]  to the multinational digital technology company net company to develop maintain and support the nhs

[1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:24.080]  because of so many sciences and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistle

[1:48:07.920 --> 1:48:16.160]  u k outlet the title title is fantastic mark zuckerberg's metaverse will quote steal your
[1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:24.080]  identity so you mindlessly conform conform experts warn yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what it's
[1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:28.560]  yeah that's what it's all about concerns over the meta versus effect on individual identities
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:34.240]  have been growing among experts as companies continue to push push forward with plans to
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:38.480]  enter the metaverse many questions are being raised about the future of digital identities online
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.080]  meta zeo mark zuckerberg has long been vocal about his plans for the metaverse a digital world
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:48.800]  that will combine gaming social media augmented reality and cryptocurrency for an integrated
[1:48:49.520 --> 1:48:56.320]  user prison experience sorry user experience the metaverse is the next evolution of social
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:04.880]  connection he says well david our bach an american author and former microsoft and google software
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:10.960]  engineer posits in an essay published in unheard that a user's individual individuality will only
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:18.080]  suffer further in the metaverse auburn our berk our back not sure i've pronounced that predicts
[1:49:18.080 --> 1:49:23.040]  that the virtual space will foster an environment of group uniformity that will put the melting pot
[1:49:23.040 --> 1:49:28.960]  tendencies of the last century to shame saying quote individuality will be dissolved into a
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:35.840]  unified mindset of one's chosen monocultures once having joined a stratum members will naturally
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:39.920]  play down their differences in favor of their commonalities to the point where they forget
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:45.120]  those differences our bach writes furthermore the former engineer believes the users will not
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:49.600]  only be robbed of their individuality but their identities will essentially be for sale writing
[1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:54.400]  quote the result of the metaverse will be the monetization of identity the metaverse seeks
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:00.480]  to make money off of less loaded aspects of identity by fostering intra group solidarity
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:08.240]  through purchases yeah you are a commodity in the future he says he continues or rather this is
[1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:16.160]  ternan ray former technology editor for barons they're concerned with basic individual autonomy
[1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:20.640]  being compromised in the virtual world quote in a metaverse as conceived by meta CEO mark
[1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:25.040]  zuggberg you cannot even scratch your virtual nose without permission of a program controlled
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:31.520]  completely by the company no one who enters the metaverse of any kind into enters into a metaverse
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:36.960]  of any kind has any autonomy their every move is at the discretion of the digital controls of
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:41.280]  corporations such as meta that reserve the right to refuse freedom of movement to anyone
[1:50:41.280 --> 1:50:46.000]  and what you really need to understand when you're hearing things like this is that this
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:52.240]  is not a problem that the metaverse has to try to overcome this is the point of the metaverse
[1:50:52.960 --> 1:50:57.680]  this is the ultimate goal that they are trying to reach it's not it's not some sort of issue
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:02.480]  that they need to work out and something that they need to confront no no the metaverse is impossible
[1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:09.440]  without this aspect and the implementation of the metaverse is contingent on this aspect the fact
[1:51:09.440 --> 1:51:15.600]  that you will not be able to do anything own anything say anything without the express approval
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:20.000]  of your corporate overlords that's the point of the metaverse and that's the point of the great
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:26.240]  reset it's not a flaw it's baked into the code it's the reason they're doing it and if you think
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:32.480]  it's the metaverse where this problem is worse just understand that this is the great reset
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:38.640]  new world order paradigm that they're trying to implement in real life and they're trying to overlay
[1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:47.040]  their own controlled digital manufactured imagined world on top of the real world so that they have
[1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:53.200]  complete control i haven't even seen this headline complete control over your every action mark
[1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:58.640]  zuckerberg says meta employees refer to him as the eye of sauron but things the nickname comes from
[1:51:58.640 --> 1:52:06.240]  a place of love yeah yeah yeah and mark zuckerberg's just like i love when people call me satan i think
[1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:12.800]  it's because they love me i love when they refer to me as the embodiment of of evil the ever-watching
[1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:19.920]  eye flaming eye of satan himself i think it's because they like me so much and think about
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:26.560]  the stories that we've covered over and over and really again it's it's an aspect of their most
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:31.840]  basic like foundational ideology or mindset or whatever you want to call it that you'd see
[1:52:31.840 --> 1:52:36.960]  headline after headline story after story of people who work at facebook saying it's it's horrible
[1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:42.640]  you have to pretend to be happy all the time and if you aren't happy they they will ostracize you and
[1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:48.880]  if you dare to disagree with what they say they'll fire you or or you know destroy your life or
[1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:54.400]  you know kick you out of your friend group whatever it is it's like it's the same thing that you hear
[1:52:55.120 --> 1:52:59.680]  from the people that are quitting kamala harris's administration right they're just like oh it's
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:04.160]  awful everybody bullies you all the time and you're forced to conform to this group think
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:12.800]  and it's just horrific and brutal and makes you question your own sanity i'm not even gonna
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:17.120]  read that headline not gonna i'm not gonna say it i'm not gonna i'm not gonna talk about it but
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:24.400]  again it there's something sick about these people there's something deep deep seated in their soul
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:31.440]  that is vicious and it uses very simple methods of control in the same way like they're the same
[1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:35.840]  methods we talked about this many times same methods that an abusive husband will use to
[1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:42.320]  control his wife it's the same levers being pulled it's the same very simplistic you know
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:49.200]  psychological prerogatives that are being exploited just in this case on a global scale or national
[1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:55.280]  scale rather than an individual scale and it's not an out you know facebook's not an outlier in
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:54:01.920]  this regard disney's experiencing it as well aren't they with the disney corporation supporting
[1:54:01.920 --> 1:54:08.960]  you know transgender children not just supporting but creating fostering establishing right through
[1:54:08.960 --> 1:54:14.880]  their propaganda they want more children to be just utterly confused about the most basic reality
[1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:22.240]  and you have people that work at disney in fact there's videos spread being spread around now
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:26.880]  because it's disney employees protesting their own company and saying it's incredibly hard to
[1:54:26.880 --> 1:54:32.640]  be a conservative that works at disney because they force you to go along with their agenda and in
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:38.880]  the great reset stakeholder capitalism paradigm that's pushed by claus Schwab corporations have
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:42.720]  an outsized influence because of the amount of money and capital they control and because they
[1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:48.480]  can dictate to their employees what they're allowed to believe not fully not a hundred percent but
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:54.800]  if you want to keep your job if you don't want to be fired then you better conform you better push
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:02.080]  our agenda and you better act like you enjoy it and so that's what they're doing in florida and
[1:55:02.080 --> 1:55:07.280]  it's not really working there i know i had a caller the other day that was saying well you know you
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:11.440]  look at what disney's trying to do they're trying to force you know maybe it was the debate i was
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:16.000]  doing i can't remember they're saying it didn't work that didn't work because florida still
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:23.200]  passed the bill okay but they're still doing it and it still works in other places you know sales
[1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:31.760]  force threatened to leave idaho i believe it was unless they scrapped a bill that had to do with
[1:55:31.760 --> 1:55:36.720]  homosexuality i don't remember what it was but it passed through the legislature it had been approved
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:42.960]  of by the representatives of the people whose will was expressed by their electoral choice of these
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:48.160]  people to go make this law but all of that got overridden and the governor vetoed it because
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:55.520]  sales force run by mark benioff who is the understudy of claus Schwab sort of the next in line
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:04.560]  for the crown of the world economic forum and a very prominent proponent of the stakeholder
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:11.760]  capitalism agenda used their corporate weight to force the people of idaho to comport to their
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:17.360]  ideology rather than the other way around so this is what they do this is what their design is and
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:21.280]  whether you're in the metaverse or whether you're in the world controlled by the same people that
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:27.840]  run the metaverse your every action your every purchase your every statement will have to conform
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:32.960]  to their desires regardless of whether they're the minority or the majority regardless of whether
[1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:37.440]  they're right or wrong regardless of whether they're openly announcing as the deep state is now
[1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:42.160]  that they're using misinformation to lie to the american people you still can't question it because
[1:56:42.160 --> 1:56:51.200]  they're in charge it's really not that complicated here here's what is complicated the tangled webs
[1:56:51.200 --> 1:56:59.680]  they weave in this cabal disney names hillary clinton campaign deputy communications director
[1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:06.480]  as lead spokesperson the wall disney company is named christina shake as the new lead spokesperson
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:10.320]  the political operative who worked as an aide in the obama white house and again his deputy

[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.760]  comes after president joe biden tapped shake last year to lead the coronavirus vaccination
[1:57:21.760 --> 1:57:26.880]  campaign at the department of health and human services it's just i don't i don't know who this
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:33.920]  woman is but boy is she involved in a lot of evil stuff she's just hopping from from evil corporation
[1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:41.040]  to evil campaign to evil the health organization it's just it's just like leapfrog like evil
[1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:45.280]  leapfrog all right that's gonna do it for me rois white on the other side takes over for the alex

[1:59:01.520 --> 1:59:06.480]  waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship
[1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:11.600]  and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now with bandot video getting close
[1:59:11.600 --> 1:59:17.440]  to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:24.160]  to be able to post their content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch
[1:59:24.160 --> 1:59:30.720]  22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:36.960]  worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds

[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:33.280]  still subject to powers and dynamics outside of the usa which means that until we achieve a form
[2:01:33.280 --> 2:01:39.120]  of energy independence that is based on clean energy created here at home american citizens will still
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:44.320]  be vulnerable to wild price hikes who's not the one trying to take your guns those who say the blood
[2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:50.480]  of the the blood of patriots you know and all the stuff about how we're going to have to move
[2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:55.520]  against the government while the tree of liberty is not water in the blood of patriots what's happened
[2:01:55.520 --> 2:02:01.920]  is that there never been if you wanted to think you need to have weapons to take on the government
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:07.120]  you need f-15s and maybe some nuclear weapons oh it's it's the new world order the affirmative
[2:02:07.120 --> 2:02:17.520]  task we have now is is to actually create a new world order well everyone is talking about a new
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:22.960]  world order what does that even mean what will the new world order look like who will control it
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:27.680]  what has been touted as a right-wing conspiracy theory for the past few decades is now just
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:31.920]  loosely falling out of the mouths of global leaders everywhere but before we get to the
[2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:36.720]  various world leaders touting a new world order including biden putin jijin ping the world
[2:02:36.720 --> 2:02:42.160]  economic forum and others let's talk about the people claiming it's a big conspiracy theory
[2:02:42.160 --> 2:02:48.080]  the anti-defamation league categorizes the phrase new world under order under extremism
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:54.320]  terrorism and bigotry they define it as quote a term used to refer to a right-wing conspiracy
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:03:00.160]  theory that became popular among anti-government extremists from the 1990s onwards new world
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:05.840]  order conspiracists believe that a tyrannical socialist one world conspiracy has already taken
[2:03:05.840 --> 2:03:11.760]  over most of the planet and schemes to eliminate the last bastion of freedom the united states with
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:17.360]  the help of collaborators within the government through repressive measures as well as manufactured
[2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:23.040]  crises such as terrorist attacks and pandemics the globalist conspirators seek to eliminate
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:30.160]  dissent and to disarm americans so that the new world order can move in and enslave them everything
[2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:37.360]  the radical left touches turns into a catastrophic mess the likes of which we have never seen before
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:43.280]  to this extent we have never seen anything like it before biden and the congressional
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:50.240]  democrats triggered massive inflation they declared war on american energy and the middle
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:56.560]  class is now being crushed by the highest gas and food prices in the history of our country can you
[2:03:56.560 --> 2:04:03.840]  believe it and i'm deeply proud of the work she's doing his first lady with joining forces initiative
[2:04:03.840 --> 2:04:09.920]  she started with michelle obama when she was vice president and now carries on people really really
[2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:17.200]  get that this guy is a mega massive disaster now the globalists wanted him to be in there to take
[2:04:17.200 --> 2:04:21.600]  the blame for their build back better collapse civilization you gotta collapse civilization
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:25.680]  to build back better so when you're build back better that means collapse enslave you cut your
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:30.800]  resources off make you dependent on the system for depopulation uh efforts that come in the next
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:37.600]  phase but it's it's but he's so bad that it's really even hurt the new world order now as
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:45.040]  usual the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray the trajectory where we're going everything
[2:04:45.040 --> 2:04:57.520]  that's been set in motion nobody can turn it around not the new world order not us only god
[2:04:58.800 --> 2:05:06.480]  want to thank folks that got part one in the three part founder series at 1776 coin dot com

[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:16.400]  must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants the coin i designed i'm very very proud
[2:05:16.400 --> 2:05:22.400]  of it and it will end up being a collectible i know that the first coin is already selling on e-ban
[2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:28.800]  other places for three times what we sold it we need to sell all 10 000 of these very very quickly
[2:05:28.800 --> 2:05:34.640]  and i appreciate listeners are getting over half of them now i'd like to move them out very quickly
[2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:40.000]  i think they will sell out probably in five or six more days and without the last coin sale we
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:44.160]  would not be operating at the same capacity we would have had to lay off a lot of people and
[2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:48.080]  had some big problems so it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of
[2:05:48.080 --> 2:05:52.160]  liberty and freedom and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems so
[2:05:52.160 --> 2:06:02.080]  please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new world order at 1776 coin dot com
[2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:13.120]  because the owners of this country don't want that i'm talking about the real owners now the real
[2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:18.480]  owners the big wealthy business and just to control things and make all the important decisions
[2:06:18.480 --> 2:06:22.800]  forget the politicians the politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom
[2:06:22.800 --> 2:06:32.800]  of choice you don't you have no choice you have owners they own you they own everything they own
[2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:37.440]  all the important land they own and control the corporations they've long since bought and paid
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:40.960]  for the senate the congress the state houses and city halls they got the judges in their back
[2:06:40.960 --> 2:06:45.360]  buckets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and
[2:06:45.360 --> 2:06:54.080]  information you get to hear they got you by the balls they want obedient workers obedient workers
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:58.400]  people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough
[2:06:58.400 --> 2:07:04.080]  to passively accept jobs with the lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime
[2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:08.400]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming
[2:07:08.400 --> 2:07:13.280]  for your social security money so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street
[2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:21.760]  it's a big club and you ain't in it and you said recently quote when you give they do whatever the
[2:07:21.760 --> 2:07:27.600]  hell you want them to do you better believe it so what specifically did they do if i ask them if
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:32.240]  i need them you know most of the people on this stage i've given to just so you understand a lot
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:39.200]  of money you and i are not in the big club the owners of this country know the truth it's called
[2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:45.200]  the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it but i'll tell you what they don't
[2:07:45.200 --> 2:07:49.760]  want they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking they don't want
[2:07:49.760 --> 2:07:54.480]  well-informed well educated people capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that
[2:07:54.480 --> 2:08:00.240]  that doesn't help them that's against their interest that's right from the front lines of the
[2:08:00.240 --> 2:08:16.400]  information war it's alex jones
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:20.720]  uh so i am i'm rolling we'll be ready well can you tell us at all what's what you're talking
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:26.400]  about in there we can't get into what's happening in the deaf we can't get into what's happening
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:30.880]  inside there because right now they mark the deposition as confidential and so have we but
[2:08:30.880 --> 2:08:36.160]  i can't tell you why i'm here i'm here because there is a war against the first amendment
[2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:41.840]  and the democratic party and others are trying to use the sandy hook tragedy as a pretext to not
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:46.240]  just erase my first amendment but all america's first amendment this is all about cancel culture
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:50.560]  this is all about censorship it's about the dying corporate media wanting to demonize
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:54.480]  the independent media i've certainly made mistakes i'm not perfect i apologize for those
[2:08:54.480 --> 2:09:01.120]  but the mainstream media lied about wmds in iraq lied about so many things jesse schmollett got
[2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:06.800]  caught lying we have thousands of cases of governments organizations corporations individuals
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:12.960]  staging events and so americans ask questions about all events and we have a right to do that
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.280]  under the first amendment the power structure doesn't want people to be able to ask questions
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:22.240]  i believe sandy hook happened i'm sorry for the families but they're being used in my view as
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:28.320]  pawns by powerful democrat law firms that want to try to shut down info wars and alex jones so once
[2:09:28.320 --> 2:09:32.880]  that dominant falls they'll be able to shut down everybody people don't even remember adam lands
[2:09:32.880 --> 2:09:37.760]  his name the craze teenager that wouldn't kill those poor children and others they think about
[2:09:37.760 --> 2:09:43.440]  alex jones when they hear about the dead children how is that that's media brainwashing that's a
[2:09:43.440 --> 2:09:48.400]  system that wants to shut down his competition taking a few things somebody said out of context
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:54.160]  and then setting them up as a villain i'm not a villain and i'm here to stand up for the first
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:59.520]  amendment of all americans to question anything they wish that is what this country is all about
[2:09:59.520 --> 2:10:04.800]  so alex just so i'm clear you are walking back what you first said about sandy hook being a hoax
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:10.160]  i've walked back what i said about sandy hook years and years and years ago the corporate media
[2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:15.440]  has never really let my quotes about that or my apologies to get out they keep misrepresenting
[2:10:15.440 --> 2:10:20.080]  that i'm currently denying it happened or i'm attacking the families none of that happened i
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:24.720]  did question some of the anomalies but i learned those anomalies were not a correct i corrected
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:30.240]  myself even at the time of meghan kelly years ago i said i believe it happened they edited that out
[2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:37.200]  of the interview i hope you don't do that here thank you so much for talking to me god bless you
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:45.200]  okay that's fine you know i'm not going to get into the details of the deposition
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:50.480]  because i know the judge earlier on has said don't release part of the deposition now i know
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:54.480]  that costcoff is saying now they want to release this deposition if they want to keep their deposition
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:59.920]  secret but put mine out that's what they've done this whole time i'm being railroaded i've been
[2:10:59.920 --> 2:11:04.000]  defaulted they say for not giving them documents or falsifying documents but they have all the
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:10.240]  documents and are saying they're real in my deposition so i know the judge has lied i know
[2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:14.800]  that we gave them all the real documents and she decided to say that we're guilty of a crime and
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:19.680]  gave her fake documents on my four and a half year old daughter we did not give them fake documents
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:24.720]  abby struck down my lightning so they have all demonized me they have decided i can be destroyed
[2:11:24.720 --> 2:11:29.600]  and i'm being railroaded i am having my rights destroyed i've had my eighth amendment destroyed
[2:11:29.600 --> 2:11:35.280]  with huge fines that are cruel and unusual they changed their deposition times eight times with
[2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:39.440]  us i've already been deposed three times in sandy hook in another case i've not hidden from any of
[2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:45.440]  this boom i get sick last week with the sinus infection and stuff had vertigo instant fines
[2:11:45.440 --> 2:11:50.160]  25 000 a day get up here to kinetic you're gonna do it right now you're a criminal no i'm not a
[2:11:50.160 --> 2:11:56.160]  criminal i didn't kill the children at sandy hook adam lanza did but everyone knows alex jones is
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:00.320]  connected to sandy hook now because they're using it as a way to demonize the first amendment we
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:05.520]  have seen jesse small at stage his racial attack we've seen wmd's and iraq being fake we've seen
[2:12:05.520 --> 2:12:09.920]  the gulf of tonkin being fake we have seen so many examples of things being staged that we have a
[2:12:09.920 --> 2:12:15.280]  right to challenge events that have anomalies years ago i said i believe sandy hook happened
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:20.000]  and that's when they sued me and have come after me because i got so famous they've attached me to
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:24.720]  sandy hook claiming i became famous from sandy hook now i became famous being a talk show host for
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:31.840]  28 years and my show exploded under obama because when you have a democrat in office conservative
[2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:37.840]  talk radio gets bigger when you have a republican in office democrats get bigger that's why i'm cnn and
[2:12:38.640 --> 2:12:44.960]  msnbc got so huge under trump and then as soon as he left the ratings plunged about that one's
[2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:50.160]  playing they're saying i built my news operation off sandy hook that was less than one percent of
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.840]  what we covered over the years not even one half one percent it's a lie so so so that part's a lie
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:13:00.000]  it's not about whether i question whether the children died or not or talked about anomalies
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:05.520]  it's that they lie and say that i didn't give them documents and i falsified reports then that judge
[2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:10.480]  should go to the federal government or to an agency and call for my indictment if we falsified
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:16.000]  financial reports then then they should be able to indict me but no she's a liar and they're a liar
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:19.920]  and and our freedoms are being trampled and destroyed they have all my documents they have
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:25.200]  everything no one in a defamation case i'm told has ever turned over this much stuff and they say
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:31.360]  i've given them nothing or it's fake and that is totally absolutely not true and so they knew that
[2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:36.080]  i couldn't have a fair trial so they've tried me in the press they demonize me they set them a fraud
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:41.120]  they set them a liar they say i gave them fake documents they did all this i questioned whether
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:45.600]  sandy hook was fake years ago and i'm supposedly the worst on earth now they with no evidence say
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:52.160]  i gave them false financial records it's totally insane what has happened here in this country so
[2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:57.680]  i didn't kill the children adam lanza did i believe sandy hook happened but i'm being used to be
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:02.160]  demonized so that they can go and censor alternative media because the mainstream corporate media is
[2:14:02.160 --> 2:14:06.240]  dying and they want to be able to shut us down so the family is claiming that they've been getting
[2:14:06.240 --> 2:14:10.640]  hate messages from some of your followers based off of what you said what is your message what do
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:14.960]  you have to say about that well somebody could start sending you guys hate messages uh in somebody
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:18.400]  else's name or or somebody could send hate messages in your name does that mean you could
[2:14:18.400 --> 2:14:23.600]  take it off the air that idea that they claim some people harass them with no real evidence of that
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:27.920]  and now i'm going to be taken off the air which is basically their goal look most of families
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:31.360]  didn't assume me and those that did i understand have had a lot of pain but attacking me won't
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:36.000]  bring their children back uh and claiming that my free speech uh is is is hurting them and then
[2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:40.640]  misrepresenting what i've said is not going to bring their children back okay and so they're
[2:14:40.640 --> 2:14:45.280]  using this to get rid of the first amendment everybody's right to free speech and to question
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:51.440]  things like wmds in iraq uh or operation northwoods or the gulf of tonkin are jesse smaller i said
[2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:56.480]  jesse small it was fake the day after it happened didn't buy it and i was right so i'm right more
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.680]  than i'm wrong sometimes i'm wrong and i said years ago i believe sandy hook happened and they've
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:06.320]  made it a huge deal about questioning narratives that's what's happening so i don't i have to get
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:10.000]  back in this deposition what do you have to say to your followers who still believe that sandy hook
[2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.800]  is a hoax well when people say your followers believe sandy hooks a hoax the internet didn't
[2:15:14.800 --> 2:15:19.840]  believe it day one it happened we covered the internet not believing it so people not trusting
[2:15:19.840 --> 2:15:23.440]  the mainstream media and the government is the government the mainstream media's fault being
[2:15:23.440 --> 2:15:29.120]  caught lying so much no one questions uh no one basically believes what they have to say anymore
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:33.600]  okay so just because the corporate media is discredited doesn't mean that's alex jones's fault

[2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:33.440]  it's called the great reset tough guy it's called the new world order it's called the big banks
[2:20:33.440 --> 2:20:38.560]  wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take
[2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:43.680]  control of our lives with a social credit score and the universal basic income that's everything
[2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:48.960]  that's the whole future of our lives the whole world is going to be about surveillance and control
[2:20:48.960 --> 2:20:52.800]  and then manipulating and tracking everything you do it's all being officially announced
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:56.080]  we've got articles everywhere their press releases saying
[2:20:59.840 --> 2:21:03.840]  and the crew asking during the break they go are you all right you really seem upset you

[2:21:31.600 --> 2:21:36.880]  starving death begging for god to help them and no one's coming because god tells us to get up
[2:21:36.880 --> 2:21:42.400]  and take action and then we don't do anything and that paralyzes god
[2:21:44.640 --> 2:21:49.040]  yeah god can do it god needs us to do it because that's not pretty well
[2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:54.240]  once again not for the first time what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory

[2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:25.120]  this off we don't get sane people to stop the bottle list i mean we won't be here at six months
[2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:40.480]  you won't be here at six months who is the most banned news network in the world info wars.com
[2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:47.040]  info wars comes to mind info wars info wars you watch info wars info wars it's a radio show
[2:22:47.040 --> 2:22:53.200]  hosted by alex jones alex jones nice guy you must be a threat if they call you out by name alex jones
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:59.440]  alex jones alex jones alex jones alex jones is the greatest he knows who it is playing this joke
[2:22:59.440 --> 2:23:05.360]  over here that's why the platform didn't work alex has been right on for a over a decade you need to
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:15.920]  listen to alex jones. Henry Kissinger, Klaus Schwab, the whole globalist system that they've
[2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:21.120]  inherited from the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds think they're god but they're not god they didn't
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:24.480]  create this planet they didn't create the sun they didn't create the universe they didn't create the
[2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:30.720]  trillions and trillions of galaxies that we know exist they can't even comprehend god or how to be
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:36.800]  just good people all they are selfish demons that seek to take control of your life who seek to
[2:23:36.800 --> 2:23:41.680]  harness humanity and convince us that they are superior to us and that we have to serve them
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:47.360]  and their ideas they want control of our bodies with their nanotech with their genetic engineering
[2:23:47.360 --> 2:23:51.840]  they want us to accept the fact that they can put in our bodies what they want when they want and
[2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:57.920]  then lie to us about the fact they call it a vaccine when it is gene therapy this is all about
[2:23:57.920 --> 2:24:04.160]  their quest for eternal life they are testing on the general public trying to find compounds
[2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:09.920]  from toxic experiments to give them what they call the lazarith gene and other systems they're
[2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:16.640]  searching for it all started in the 1950s when they discovered immortal cell lines cells that
[2:24:16.640 --> 2:24:24.960]  never die and replicate forever we call it of course the more vicious types of cancer but through
[2:24:24.960 --> 2:24:30.640]  death and through mass experimentation against the general population they believe they will
[2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:36.000]  find the keys to immortality so as you see the beauty of the universe that god gave us realize
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:41.600]  the globalists are not god the globalists are simply parasites who are selfishly trying to
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:47.840]  take control of your life in a hope of artificially building immortality for themselves when immortality
[2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:54.000]  has been given to us by god through our consciousness if we choose to be with god and not serve ourselves
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:59.360]  and be selfish entities and that's the truth and that's what implore war stands for is getting you
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.320]  to think for yourself and to get outside the box and realize that god created the universe
[2:25:04.320 --> 2:25:10.320]  for us to have communion with god not for us to pretend that we are god those that try to do that
[2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:15.920]  have a name for them they're called satans they believe that lucifer could be his own god just as
[2:25:15.920 --> 2:25:20.960]  they could be their own god just as in the story of adam and eve in the bible satan says to eve
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:26.720]  you could be a god as she goes adam says you can be a god just eat up this tree of the knowledge
[2:25:26.720 --> 2:25:32.640]  of good and evil the knowledge of evil we were perfect and innocent we had only the knowledge of
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:37.920]  good knowledge of evil is how to manipulate how to twist how to set up corrupt criminal systems
[2:25:37.920 --> 2:25:44.400]  how to play god as it was in the days of doha so will it be in the days of the son of man
[2:25:44.400 --> 2:25:49.840]  and we're entering those days now i'm alex jumps this is info wars tomorrow's news today
[2:25:59.280 --> 2:26:05.840]  hello americans i'm paul harvey if i were the devil if i were the prince of darkness i'd want to
[2:26:05.840 --> 2:26:10.640]  engulf the whole world in darkness and i'd have a third of its real estate in four fifths of its
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:14.640]  population but i wouldn't be happy until i had seized the ripest apple on the tree
[2:26:17.600 --> 2:26:20.640]  so i said about how every necessary to take over the united states
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:28.880]  i'd subvert the church's first i'd begin with a campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:34.000]  serpent i would whisper to you as i whispered to eve do as you please to the young i would whisper
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:39.280]  that the bible is a myth i would convince them that man created god instead of the other way around
[2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.640]  i would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square and the old i would teach you to
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:52.160]  pray after me our father which aren't in washington and then i'd get organized i'd educate authors
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:56.320]  in how to make a loaded literature exciting so that anything else would appear dull and
[2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:02.240]  uninteresting i'd threaten tv with dirtier movies and vice versa i'd peddle narcotics to whom i could
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:07.440]  i'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction i'd tranquilize the rest with pills
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:13.360]  if i were the devil i'd soon have families that were with themselves churches that were with
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:19.920]  themselves and nations that were with themselves until each in its turn was consumed and with
[2:27:19.920 --> 2:27:26.720]  promises of higher ratings i'd have mesmerizing media fanning the flame the president of the united
[2:27:26.720 --> 2:27:32.240]  states is racist if i were the devil i would encourage schools to refine young intellects but
[2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:38.160]  neglect the discipline emotions just let those run wild within a decade i'd have prisons overflowing
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:43.280]  i'd have judges promoting pornography soon i could evict god from the courthouse then from
[2:27:43.280 --> 2:27:47.680]  the schoolhouse and then from the houses of conference and in his own churches i would
[2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:55.360]  substitute psychology for religion i would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and girls
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  and church money if i were the devil i'd take from those who have and give to those who wanted
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:08.240]  until i had killed the incentive of the ambitious i would caution against extremes i'm here to warn
[2:28:08.240 --> 2:28:14.560]  people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game in hard work in patriotism in moral conduct
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:19.760]  i would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned that swinging is more fun that what
[2:28:19.760 --> 2:28:26.720]  you see on tv is the way to be and thus i could undress you in public and i could lure you into
[2:28:26.720 --> 2:28:32.960]  bed with diseases for which there is no cure in other words if i were the devil i'd just keep
[2:28:32.960 --> 2:28:48.880]  right on doing what he's doing

[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:12.400]  isn't even the people that died no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on
[2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:20.160]  populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the
[2:32:20.160 --> 2:32:29.600]  united states to europe legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro- russian

[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:56.320]  coming on for the final half hour some of you may have heard him on monday he is uh michael dillabrock
[2:33:56.320 --> 2:34:02.720]  from bohanca watch the telegram channel that is closely tracking the propaganda on both sides of
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:09.840]  the war yes both sides of the war actually engage in propaganda you would have never have known it
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:16.160]  on his telegram channel from on the ground sources both pro-ukrain pro-russia because we have yet
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:22.800]  another alleged war crime they seem to be coming in uh bursts of two or three every week at this point
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:29.520]  of course we had the claim that russians had killed a bunch of ukrainian civilians in bukka
[2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:36.400]  a claim that emerged over the weekend claims and counter claims to say the least regarding that the
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.560]  dead individuals were seen with wearing white armbands which would have suggested that they
[2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:47.760]  were pro-russian so why the russians would kill them is another guess we've had claims of mass
[2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:53.920]  mass graves in that area at least since march the 10th well now we've got an old favorite
[2:34:53.920 --> 2:34:57.200]  that's returned i'm not going to get into it in any depth now because we're going to cover it
[2:34:57.200 --> 2:35:03.520]  later with the guest but yes the russian mobile crematoriums are back the eight-year-old youtube
[2:35:03.520 --> 2:35:10.160]  clip of a dumpster crematorium has once again circulated and indeed gone viral on twitter
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:16.560]  with zero fact check whatsoever from the much wanted much esteemed ministry of truth i mean
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:23.280]  independent fact checkers and it hasn't added twitter hasn't added a label haven't done anything
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.960]  it's a clip from an eight-year-old youtube video and they're saying this is proof of russia
[2:35:30.240 --> 2:35:40.480]  burning civilians in ukraine once again absolute tosh there's also claims the russian prisoners
[2:35:40.480 --> 2:35:47.040]  of war in fact the new york times has verified it apparently were killed near bucker by ukrainian
[2:35:47.040 --> 2:35:52.400]  troops i'm going to save all that for the second half of the show though because first i'm going
[2:35:52.400 --> 2:35:59.840]  to get into this of course elon musk acquired 9.1 according to some reports 9.2 stake in twitter
[2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:05.280]  that was announced on monday next day it was announced that he'd also be sat on the board of
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:11.760]  twitter of course he's now the biggest individual shareholder and this has caused absolute bed
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:16.560]  lemon panic i'm going to get the latest updates to you here in a minute but first let's set the
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:23.200]  table with this video that i made after the original announcement this is called feels like
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:33.280]  we're back here's the clip did you ever think you'd see the day elon musk is now the largest
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:38.240]  individual shareholder of twitter and today he was appointed to the board of directors yes
[2:36:39.920 --> 2:36:44.880]  all this just days after musk said twitter's failure to uphold free speech fundamentally
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:50.640]  undermines democracy all the right people are fuming a prominent transfer buying a large
[2:36:50.640 --> 2:36:56.160]  stake in twitter is not at all funny i would have been kind of terrified right now when ember seals
[2:36:56.160 --> 2:37:03.200]  with preferred pronouns in their bios are big mad you know it's a good day for the good guys
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:09.600]  others complained about the impact on the company culture oh no not the precious company culture
[2:37:09.600 --> 2:37:15.680]  culture of war weaponized mobs of angry soy jacks and beard splainers demanding anyone who dares
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:21.840]  suggest chromosomes exist be publicly humiliated and banned swivel on it bring back trump make
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:31.840]  twitter fun again
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:45.840]  oh my god
[2:37:45.840 --> 2:37:55.760]  oh holy smokes man can elon save twitter surely he's up against a wall of opposition maybe but
[2:37:55.760 --> 2:38:00.720]  many of them won't be there for much longer twitter CEO parag agrawall the guy who threw
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:06.640]  free speech under a bus back in 2018 he's gonna be gone soon jack dorsy seems to be on the road
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:12.160]  to achieving some kind of miraculous escape from perdition to penance express regret over the
[2:38:12.160 --> 2:38:17.520]  weekend for his role in helping giant corporations obtain monopolies over content and speech and
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:23.360]  then he welcomed musk joining the board many of the alphabet people and other adversaries of free
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:29.200]  speech will if elon sees his control be forced to perform their duty of moral exhibitionist
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:34.880]  seppuku and quit the company but the regime won't give up the fight so easily a condition of musk
[2:38:34.880 --> 2:38:40.080]  being on the board of twitter is that while he's on it he's prevented from buying more than 14.9
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:45.520]  percent of the company stock that stops him from buying more of the company or the whole thing but
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:50.640]  his new position will give him huge influence over twitter's increasingly draconian rules and
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:55.920]  content policies after he asked whether twitter adhered to free speech musk indicated he was
[2:38:55.920 --> 2:39:01.040]  giving serious thought to starting a competitor according to analysis by bank of america well
[2:39:01.040 --> 2:39:06.320]  if twitter does not agree to modify its content policies in line with elon's vision the tesla
[2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:12.320]  founder could pull the trigger on creating a new competitor not truth social or any other of these
[2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:18.640]  naff efforts one with teeth and mammoth funding zero hedge summarizers one thing is clear the
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:25.280]  current management team at twitter headed by woke ceo parag agrawal is as good as gone get woke
[2:39:25.280 --> 2:39:31.440]  go broke in reverse the mere prospect of twitter once again becoming a genuine free speech platform
[2:39:31.440 --> 2:39:37.920]  is invigorating rescued from the pearl clutching grasp of echo chamber blue checkmarks liberated
[2:39:37.920 --> 2:39:44.400]  from abuse by cretinist journalists who weaponized it to ruin people's lives and silence ideological
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:51.680]  opposition freed from the ministry of truth fact checker legacy media industrial complex who sanitized
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:58.720]  it by banning anyone interesting and ring fencing permissible overton windows of discussion emancipated
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:05.040]  from screeching astroturf hashtag activists and the mob who manipulated it to dog pile publicly
[2:40:05.040 --> 2:40:11.440]  shame tar and feather anyone who dared contradict regime narratives to think that all that malignancy
[2:40:11.440 --> 2:40:17.600]  will just vanish overnight is pie in the sky but there's a real chance of change hang on isn't this
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:24.240]  all a trojan horse how could it be that the richest man in the world isn't in fact part of the regime
[2:40:24.240 --> 2:40:30.080]  it just sounds too good to be true well it is true i can confirm with 100 percent certainty
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:35.680]  the elon musk is indeed based and much to the horror of the woke cretins who have had the
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:41.920]  run of the social media network for years twitter may be about to be based again too feels like
[2:40:41.920 --> 2:40:52.320]  we're back boys feels like we're back now that was two days ago there've been several
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:58.720]  developments since first of all twitter came out shortly after i released this video with a statement
[2:40:59.680 --> 2:41:05.680]  assuring basically their far left woke managers and employees that they're gonna completely disregard
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:11.280]  the owners of the company itself and the board members and that elon musk or anyone else on
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:18.400]  the board won't play any role in quote policy decisions they said our policy decisions are
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:23.840]  not determined by the board or shareholders i'm sure they have been before by the way in fact
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:32.000]  i know for a fact that when twitter bans any prominent verified individual on twitter they
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:37.200]  have to have a meeting of at least some of the board members to put the rubber stamp on that
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:42.800]  permanent suspension i know that for a fact that's been reversed apparently though in this statement
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.280]  it says our policy decisions are not determined by the board or shareholders and we have no plans
[2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:53.840]  to reverse any policy decisions which of course mainly applies to president trump there's a big
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:42:01.040]  call twitter orange again by bringing back trump who by the way if you remember was banned for
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:06.880]  absolutely no reason whatsoever there was no evidence there were no tweets of him inciting
[2:42:06.880 --> 2:42:12.560]  the january 6 rioters who now we know from court cases are getting off on the fact that they were
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:19.280]  allowed into the building no reason to ban trump whatsoever in the first place but as to whether
[2:42:19.280 --> 2:42:23.920]  he's coming back they're basically saying no he's not coming back they're basically saying elon musk
[2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:29.840]  is not going to have any impact on the decisions i'm sure elon has a very different take on that so
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:36.480]  they came out with this mealy mouth statement to try and assuage their woke managers and employees
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:41.120]  and put them back in their box and basically say don't worry twitter is going to continue to be a
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:47.520]  safe space for far left radicals and extremists the rules which they break on a daily basis of
[2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:51.280]  course when conservatives break those rules they get banned the left doesn't but we're going to
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:56.880]  come back in the next segment and tell you the latest on twitter's woke response summit dot news

[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:23.120]  titled world government summit and they are announcing incredible tyranny everything we've

[2:46:01.840 --> 2:46:10.160]  wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist
[2:46:10.160 --> 2:46:18.000]  resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program and man our work is really right now
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:24.320]  hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done so i'm asking listeners now to realize
[2:46:24.320 --> 2:46:30.480]  we've got great products thousands of them at infowarstore.com and we are funded by listeners
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:36.240]  and viewers like you and so now we need to support more than ever because this fight has intensified

[2:46:43.040 --> 2:46:48.320]  right now things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life fizzy magnesium mix that's

[2:46:55.280 --> 2:47:02.000]  percent off at infowarstore.com right now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:14.800]  order it's alex jones
[2:47:16.400 --> 2:47:21.520]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[2:47:21.520 --> 2:47:32.240]  so elon mosk bought a 9.2 percent stake in twitter he's on the board twitter responded
[2:47:32.240 --> 2:47:36.880]  to the panic by coming out and saying don't worry he's not going to have any influence over policy
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:43.680]  decisions or basically reversing bans primarily the ban of president trump which was completely
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:49.600]  unwarranted and unfair he was basically railroaded off of all social media simultaneously much like
[2:47:49.600 --> 2:47:54.960]  alex jones was back in the day so they came out with this mealy mouth statement trying to placate
[2:47:54.960 --> 2:48:02.400]  the woke mob that now runs trit at twitter the blue check mark pink hair brigade but the panic
[2:48:02.400 --> 2:48:10.000]  continues to see deep into the managerial strata of twitter and the employee base because Reuters
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:16.720]  came out with a headline which i summarized in an article that i wrote twitter inside as panicking
[2:48:16.720 --> 2:48:23.280]  elon mosk will prevent them from censoring content now it goes through a series of accounts of
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:29.040]  employees and managers that Reuters spoke to in this article that came out today and this statement
[2:48:29.040 --> 2:48:36.080]  that twitter put out yesterday has done nothing to dampen their quote alarm and fear in this article
[2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:42.880]  they state uh the danger to twitter is that mosk is a self-proclaimed quote free speech absolutist
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:50.000]  yes they actually say that as if it's a bad thing says despite twitter's reiteration this week that
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:55.120]  the board does not make policy decisions four twitter employees who spoke with Reuters said
[2:48:55.120 --> 2:49:01.840]  they were concerned about mosk's ability to influence the company's policies on abusive
[2:49:01.840 --> 2:49:08.960]  users and harmful content in other words woke snowflakes who have seized control of twitter
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:13.840]  and used it as their tool to silence the free speech of dissenters and political adversaries
[2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:20.160]  are worried their monopoly and control might be coming to an end this is about them losing the
[2:49:20.160 --> 2:49:27.680]  power to mass ban to mass censor prominent users and important content such as the hunter
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:32.880]  biden laptop story which was obviously suppressed and censored not just by facebook but by also
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:39.440]  twitter before the election along with many other real things meanwhile their fact checker
[2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:46.480]  industrial complex only fact checks one side of the debate when you get a flagrant fake news story
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:52.480]  like mobile russian crematoriums in ukraine nothing happens to it whatsoever i just looked
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:49:58.800]  at that tweet earlier there's no warning label on it whatsoever because fact checkers are parties
[2:49:58.800 --> 2:50:05.840]  and hacks they're just an extension of the same legacy media complex so Reuters spoke to these
[2:50:05.840 --> 2:50:12.800]  woke employees within twitter and they're still in all of a tizzy since the employees said his
[2:50:12.800 --> 2:50:20.160]  views on moderation which is basically basic free speech and the rules equally applied to everyone
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:26.720]  could weaken years long efforts to make twitter a place of healthy discourse and might allow trolling
[2:50:26.720 --> 2:50:32.400]  of mob attacks to flourish give me a break the only mob attacks that are allowed to flourish on
[2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:41.120]  twitter are led by left-wing mobs every single time they're allowed to lead mob attacks anyone
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:47.360]  questions anyone on the other side of the equation it's like how dare you you saw the tailor lorenz
[2:50:47.360 --> 2:50:53.040]  clip a few days ago where she's crying because she gets a bit of pushback this woman who deliberately
[2:50:53.040 --> 2:50:58.640]  weaponized her quote journalism to try and ruin the lives of private individuals primarily
[2:51:01.600 --> 2:51:06.880]  doxing Pamela Geller's daughters whenever she gets any pushback she claims a mass harassment
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:13.760]  conspiracy cries on television but then left-wing mobs on a daily basis do the same thing to people
[2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:19.600]  on the right do the same thing to private citizens who share memes cnn does it they go and visit old
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:25.360]  ladies for sharing trump memes oh that's fine though because the rules aren't equally applied
[2:51:26.320 --> 2:51:32.400]  so when they say a place of healthy discourse that of course means controlling the narrative
[2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:37.680]  controlling what you're allowed to say banning people who dare suggest that chromosomes exist
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:45.040]  making it a safe space for far-left activists who and radicals who wantonly violate the same
[2:51:45.040 --> 2:51:51.440]  rules that have led to conservatives having their accounts permanently banned mob attacks are also
[2:51:51.440 --> 2:51:56.160]  a routine feature of twitter discourse with virtually all of them being led by far left mobs
[2:51:56.160 --> 2:52:02.560]  it's okay when we do it the article continues it goes on to say that employees are fearful
[2:52:02.560 --> 2:52:08.400]  twitter's insistence that musk's presence on its board won't lead to more free speech god forbid
[2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:15.760]  on the platform is hollow one employee told reuters quote i find it hard to believe the board
[2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:21.760]  doesn't have influence if that's the case why would elon want a board seat and it's they want the
[2:52:21.760 --> 2:52:26.560]  board to have influence because the board is entirely made up of people who are water carriers
[2:52:26.560 --> 2:52:32.240]  and amplifiers for their far-left agenda it's okay when all the people on the board represent
[2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:37.920]  their political interests when you get one single person who maybe wants a bit of balance
[2:52:37.920 --> 2:52:45.920]  oh my god the horror others are concerned musk might push back against twitter's policy of
[2:52:45.920 --> 2:52:51.520]  inclusivity which is seemingly based around transgender activists being empowered to ban
[2:52:51.520 --> 2:52:58.720]  people who say men are men then they quote of this guy guidehouse insights analyst
[2:52:58.720 --> 2:53:06.000]  sam abul samid who told reuters that musk could be influential in yes making twitter orange again
[2:53:06.000 --> 2:53:11.920]  by restoring donald trump's twitter account he said quote i wouldn't be surprised if twitter
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:16.800]  restores trump's account now that elon owns nearly 10 percent of the company oh my god the horror
[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:24.000]  again isn't he still in some weird facebook limbo where they didn't even properly ban him but just
[2:53:24.000 --> 2:53:29.440]  restricted him from having access to the account and that's now gone on for a year and three months
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:37.680]  absolutely incredible based on the complete phony premise that trump incited facilitated the
[2:53:37.680 --> 2:53:43.440]  january 6 riot when it was literally facilitated by people letting them into the building as he's
[2:53:43.440 --> 2:53:49.440]  now proven in court cases the reuters article ends by saying that numerous employees are
[2:53:49.440 --> 2:53:56.240]  considering quitting over elon musk's involvement oh no well some people are dusting off their
[2:53:56.240 --> 2:54:02.320]  resumes one person said i don't want to work for somebody like musk somebody who values free
[2:54:02.320 --> 2:54:09.600]  speech on a public town square platform oh my god the absolute horror of that don't let the door
[2:54:09.600 --> 2:54:16.320]  hit you on the way out so the more of these idiots that do quit the better the pessimist in me thinks
[2:54:16.320 --> 2:54:22.880]  that you know musk is going to get elbowed aside and his influence over trying to make twitter
[2:54:22.880 --> 2:54:28.480]  great again trying to make it an actual free speech platform trying to restore accounts of
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:34.800]  prominent individuals like trump like project veritas who were unfairly banned is not going to
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:39.360]  happen but again we have to at least cling to that hope that him being on the board him being the
[2:54:39.360 --> 2:54:47.360]  largest shareholder him valuing free speech will have some kind of influence on twitter and boy
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:54.000]  is the regime and the regimes golfers and minions panicking about it which is always good to see
[2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:01.840]  meanwhile zero hedge reports new york times top editor orders reporters to quote meaning fully
[2:55:01.840 --> 2:55:08.960]  reduce twitter usage as musk joins company board just days after elon musk herself described free
[2:55:08.960 --> 2:55:14.400]  speech absolutist unveiled a 9.2 stake in twitter and was rewarded with the seat on the company's
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:18.240]  board listing cheers from republicans and conservatives who long seen their speech
[2:55:18.240 --> 2:55:24.000]  suppressed on the platform the new york times executive editor has reportedly orders ordered
[2:55:24.000 --> 2:55:27.920]  the papers army of reporters many of whom are among the platforms most closely followed
[2:55:27.920 --> 2:55:33.440]  journalists to reduce the amount of time they spend tweeting they're basically telling them
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:40.320]  stop scrolling on twitter stop tweeting it's a waste of time so their indications that they're
[2:55:40.320 --> 2:55:45.360]  telling them to move away from the platform maybe they're going to try and go back to facebook i
[2:55:45.360 --> 2:55:51.280]  don't know in terms of making that the number one news platform in terms of social media
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:57.360]  but indications from the new york times that they are going cold on twitter in the aftermath of this
[2:55:57.360 --> 2:56:05.440]  elon musk news let's move on though now because we have a french presidential election first
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:11.440]  round of which is just a few days away on sunday next segment when i come back i'm going to play
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:16.880]  you a video which talks about the shocking results of a poll first though we have this headline
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:24.800]  president macron says he is opposed to self-defense after farmer shoots one of four burglars who
[2:56:24.800 --> 2:56:32.800]  broke into his home this is the extraordinary story of a 35 year old farmer in northern france
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:38.240]  who was having his home broken into at 11 p.m at night he's got his three-year-old daughter there
[2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:45.600]  in the house he confronts these four burglars very brave of him if you don't know france
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:52.160]  they still have hunting again god forbid so they have a lot of loop holes that allow them to get
[2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:58.080]  around the bans on private ownership of firearms you still have many farmers who are allowed to
[2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:04.800]  have shotguns and things like that so four burglars four criminals break into his house he's got his
[2:57:04.800 --> 2:57:11.120]  three-year-old daughter there he shoots one of them dead good for him but macron responded
[2:57:11.120 --> 2:57:15.440]  by basically throwing this guy who should be hailed as a hero and yet has been charged with
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:22.480]  murder under a boss he said quote bear in mind this is on the eve of the presidential election
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:28.960]  bit of an own goal i am opposed to self-defense he literally thinks the farmer should have cowered
[2:57:28.960 --> 2:57:34.960]  in a corner allowed these four criminals to ransack his house potentially harm his three-year-old
[2:57:34.960 --> 2:57:40.160]  daughter and do absolutely nothing we're going to come back and talk about that another massive
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:44.400]  developments in france ahead of the election on the other side summit dot news don't go away
[2:57:44.400 --> 2:57:51.440]  i want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part founder series
[2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:58.960]  at 1776 coin dot com or info or store dot com and the second installment is the tree of liberty
[2:57:58.960 --> 2:58:03.760]  thomas jevison quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants it's a coin i designed
[2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:09.280]  i'm very very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible i know that the first coin is
[2:58:09.280 --> 2:58:15.040]  already selling on ebay and other places for three times what we sold it we need to sell
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:20.240]  all 10 000 of these very very quickly and i appreciate listeners getting over half of them
[2:58:20.240 --> 2:58:25.040]  now i'd like to lose them out very quickly i think they will sell out probably in five or six
[2:58:25.040 --> 2:58:31.040]  more days and without the last coin sale we would not be operating at the same capacity we
[2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:34.000]  would have had to lay off a lot of people and that's a big problem so it was a limited edition
[2:58:34.000 --> 2:58:38.000]  collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom and it's needed for our
[2:58:38.000 --> 2:58:43.040]  infrastructure and building new systems so please give yourself and us aid in the fight

[2:58:50.400 --> 2:58:58.320]  is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history and that is because the economy
[2:58:58.320 --> 2:59:04.400]  is breaking down inflation is exploding the supply chains have broken down and info wars is having
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:09.760]  serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations and i do not want to implode or
[2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:15.200]  downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move in full wars it's paradoxical it's more
[2:59:15.200 --> 2:59:20.800]  popular than ever it's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship but because of cost
[2:59:20.800 --> 2:59:24.880]  increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth everything else we

[2:59:44.080 --> 2:59:52.320]  store dot com thank you for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:59:52.320 --> 3:00:07.200]  order it's alex jones broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the
[3:00:07.200 --> 3:00:16.480]  united kingdom it's paul joseph watson so the first round of the french presidential election
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:23.520]  takes place on sunday you have ericsson more the uh firebrand right wing intellectual you have marina
[3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:29.200]  le pen the populace whose economic policies are somewhat left wing you couldn't describe them as
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:34.800]  right wing and she's kind of straight away done a light touch on the subject of mass immigration
[3:00:34.800 --> 3:00:40.960]  but she's talked about for president macron himself has talked about crime much though misfortune in
[3:00:40.960 --> 3:00:47.680]  the past few days because you had a 35 year old farmer in northern france four burglars broke into
[3:00:47.680 --> 3:00:53.520]  his home at 11 p.m he shot one of them dead he was there in his home with his three-year-old daughter
[3:00:54.160 --> 3:01:00.640]  and instead of coming out and defending this brave individual who was being charged with murder
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:07.440]  but defending himself inside his own home as burglars tried to rampage through it he's come out on
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:16.240]  the side of the criminals macron responded to this home invasion by coming down on the side of the
[3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:22.560]  burglars he said quote i am opposed to self-defense it's very clear and undisputable because otherwise
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:28.000]  the country becomes the wild west and i don't want a country where weapons proliferate again
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:33.040]  he told the farmer that he should have called the police the police aren't even out there in
[3:01:33.040 --> 3:01:38.160]  the rural areas for a start the police who have to come from the nearby towns and cities are
[3:01:38.160 --> 3:01:44.240]  completely overstretched because they have gangs of migrant criminals running around committing
[3:01:44.240 --> 3:01:48.960]  crimes when the police try to intervene but this is why you have migrant riots in french cities on
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:54.960]  regular basis the migrant gangs go and attack the police for trying to enforce the law we've talked
[3:01:54.960 --> 3:02:01.440]  about it numerous times before no go zones where the ambulance workers the fire brigade will go
[3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:07.920]  into these riot zones try to help people try to put out fires and they're pelted with rocks by
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:13.840]  these migrant gangs the police are completely overrun they're completely stretched so no you
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:21.200]  can't just call the police oh there's four guys you've got a three-year-old toddler next to you
[3:02:21.200 --> 3:02:26.240]  there's four criminals breaking into your home just call the police i'm sure it'll take them
[3:02:26.240 --> 3:02:34.080]  only a few hours to get there while they ransack your home and potentially kill you what kind of
[3:02:34.080 --> 3:02:42.560]  idiot advise macron on this a few days before the election but again it is macron he also came out
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:47.440]  with more dumb comments and this is why he has a chance of actually losing the election which
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:55.040]  i'm going to get on to this is a headline out of remix news rmx.news we are not overwhelmed
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:03:00.640]  left-wing macron buries head in sand over mass migration so mass migration according to the
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:08.400]  polls in france has been an absolute core vocal centerpiece of the entire election debate and
[3:03:08.400 --> 3:03:14.160]  macrons basically dismissed it entirely he said france is not a country of well by mass immigration
[3:03:14.160 --> 3:03:20.720]  and a policy of zero immigration is not one that should be taken seriously because of course you
[3:03:20.720 --> 3:03:25.920]  have eric zemore who's advocated a policy of remigration sending migrants with criminal
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:30.640]  backgrounds back to their home countries which you can do under the law in france they have
[3:03:30.640 --> 3:03:35.840]  agreements with north african countries where they can actually do that legally but in response
[3:03:35.840 --> 3:03:40.480]  to concerns puts him about the rate and success of france's immigration policy during his presidency
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:46.320]  macron hit back at claims from a number of his electoral rivals that france is saturated claiming
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:53.200]  the country is not submerged you have areas of paris where there are literally hundreds of thousands
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:59.440]  of illegal immigrants not just migrants illegal immigrants living in one area there was a story
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:05.600]  the other day about a jewish man who was literally chased by a migrant gang in paris to the point
[3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:13.680]  where he ran into a train that's how bad it is but macron says quote our country is not overwhelmed
[3:04:13.680 --> 3:04:20.400]  as some claim and zero immigration is neither realistic nor desirable they have a foreign
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:26.240]  population of about eight percent officially it's over ten percent if you count the unofficial numbers
[3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:30.960]  obviously they're not going to be able to count the huge number of illegal immigrants it's only
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:38.080]  rising we've seen the paris massacre happen as a result of that refugee wave being opened up to
[3:04:38.080 --> 3:04:45.040]  literal g-hardis who stole fake passports and were invited into europe we see police officers
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:50.560]  teachers being beheaded attacked on a regular basis so macron cannot dismiss this without it
[3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:57.680]  damaging his election chances we'll be back on the other side summit the dot news introducing
[3:04:57.680 --> 3:05:04.640]  the newest product from info wars life dot com we are so proud of info wars life immune support

[3:05:52.320 --> 3:06:08.240]  take action now info wars store dot com
[3:06:08.240 --> 3:06:24.320]  we are back it is the fourth hour it is the summit news hour and before the break i was talking about
[3:06:24.320 --> 3:06:30.240]  president macron facing what appears to be a tight race in the first round of the presidential
[3:06:30.240 --> 3:06:35.120]  election on sunday of course he's going to get through to the second round the way it works is
[3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:40.480]  everyone votes for the candidates in the first round the highest percentage tolls two of whom go
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:45.520]  through to the second round which then takes place a few weeks later macron is going to get
[3:06:45.520 --> 3:06:50.240]  through to the second round the question is who is going to be his challenger from the polls it
[3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:55.680]  looks like marina le penne and i'm going to get into an even more important poll here in a moment
[3:06:56.400 --> 3:07:01.920]  but macrons come out with some bizarre statement throwing a guy who tried to defend his house and
[3:07:01.920 --> 3:07:07.840]  his three-year-old daughter from criminals under a bus because he shot them dead he also came out
[3:07:07.840 --> 3:07:12.000]  and basically denied that mass uncontrolled immigration was a problem in france despite the
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:17.040]  evidence of the past four eight years proving that to be a completely ludicrous statement
[3:07:17.040 --> 3:07:22.800]  you have a large concentration of support around all these rival candidates based on what is a core
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:28.880]  issue in france mass uncontrolled immigration and macron thinks he can just ignore it one person
[3:07:28.880 --> 3:07:33.760]  who isn't ignoring it is the former french intelligence chief this is the equivalent of the
[3:07:33.760 --> 3:07:40.080]  former head of the cia in france pierre broshan who warns that europe and france radical unless
[3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:45.760]  they radically change their policies on mass immigration civil war could break out and he
[3:07:45.760 --> 3:07:52.560]  said quote all multicultural societies are doomed again this is the former head of the equivalent
[3:07:52.560 --> 3:07:59.520]  of the french cia dgse served from 2002 to 2008 and he made these comments during an interview
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:06.320]  with the prominent french newspaper lefiguero he said quote all multicultural societies are doomed
[3:08:06.320 --> 3:08:12.240]  to more or less deep rifts said in such a situation it happens that minorities are violent winners
[3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:18.880]  and majorities placid losers he went on to say the negative impact of mass immigration on france
[3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:24.480]  which macron completely ignores is even an election issue can no longer be dismissed because he's
[3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:30.080]  quote increasingly difficult to prevent the french from seeing what they see and also because quote
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:34.800]  a breakthrough personality suddenly appeared in the formulaic world of politics does encourage
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:41.840]  them to open their eyes this is again former head of french intelligence saying this this is no small
[3:08:41.840 --> 3:08:50.240]  potatoes the x intel chief predicts that if macron does win and fails to massively alter his approach
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:56.560]  which he will fail to massively alter it civil war could ensue and remember we had those letters
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:02.480]  last year signed by top military generals in france we had a similar letter signed by police
[3:09:02.480 --> 3:09:07.840]  officials in france saying that they fear civil war because they're no longer able to enforce
[3:09:07.840 --> 3:09:14.320]  basic law in many many of these outskirts suburban suburban areas of major french cities
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:20.160]  which has been completely overrun by criminal migrant gangs there's a complete collapse in
[3:09:20.160 --> 3:09:26.960]  law and order this intelligence chief went on to say quote this gradual upheaval of the french
[3:09:26.960 --> 3:09:31.680]  population if not the only challenge we face is the only one that directly threatens civil peace
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:37.040]  on our territory he warned that muslim migrants and others from outside of europe who are increasing
[3:09:37.040 --> 3:09:45.600]  every year have developed quote a spirit of post colonial revenge he goes on to talk about birth
[3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:51.200]  rates and he goes on to talk about younger generations born of immigrants are quite even
[3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:56.720]  less integrated with french society than their parents and that's a common theme that you see
[3:09:56.720 --> 3:10:03.440]  in numerous european countries including here in the uk so they're having more babies the native
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:10.560]  french population isn't having babies and in fact polls show much to the chagrin of the regime
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:15.680]  narrative that anyone who talks about quote the great replacement is a radical fringe conspiracy
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:22.080]  theories they had a poll where the majority of french people you know harris interactive poll
[3:10:22.640 --> 3:10:28.560]  felt that europeans were being replaced by non europeans in countries like france that is now a
[3:10:28.560 --> 3:10:35.280]  majority opinion in major european countries like france so hardly fringe anymore is it
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:42.240]  so macrons ignoring that mass immigration is a central core issue in france but the x head of
[3:10:42.240 --> 3:10:48.160]  the equivalent of the french cia says otherwise and says it could cause civil war now what is this
[3:10:48.160 --> 3:10:53.520]  going to cost macron in terms of his election chances his lead has been narrowing everyone
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:11:00.160]  expected he was a shoo-in to get re-elected especially after the war in ukraine obviously
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:05.600]  leaders become more popular at times of war except joe biden has booked that trend but in
[3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:12.560]  fact a shock election poll that came out today actually has challenger marine lapin who was
[3:11:12.560 --> 3:11:19.360]  quite handily defeated by macron in the previous presidential election in 2017 actually now
[3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:27.280]  leading the globalist candidate immanuel macron in france for the presidential election here is the
[3:11:27.280 --> 3:11:34.400]  clip shocking poll released on the eve of the first round of the french election reveals that
[3:11:34.400 --> 3:11:40.000]  populist marine lapin is leading president immanuel macron the poll conducted by atlas
[3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:45.120]  politico shows the national rally leader beating the incumbent in a hypothetical runoff by one
[3:11:45.120 --> 3:11:50.560]  percentage point macron's lead over lapin has been narrowing in recent weeks and it now appears
[3:11:50.560 --> 3:11:55.520]  that the election could be on a knife edge the survey was taken at around the same time macron
[3:11:55.520 --> 3:12:01.520]  made some bizarre and potentially very damaging comments on self-defense at a time when many
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:06.400]  police departments across france are being stretched to the very limit by a wave of migrant
[3:12:06.400 --> 3:12:12.240]  gang crime the 35 year old farmer in long ray was hit with murder charges after he shot one of
[3:12:12.240 --> 3:12:16.880]  four burglars who broke into his home the farmer was at home at the time of the late night break
[3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:22.720]  in with his three-year-old daughter president macron's response to throw the farmer under a
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:27.920]  bus quote i am opposed to self-defense it's very clear and indisputable because otherwise the
[3:12:27.920 --> 3:12:32.400]  country becomes the wild west macron said and i don't want a country where weapons proliferate
[3:12:32.400 --> 3:12:36.800]  and where we consider that it's up to the citizens to defend themselves in other words apart from
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:41.920]  the state which is already overrun the only people who are allowed to use weapons are criminals
[3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:46.720]  presumably the farmer should have just cowered in a corner while the burglars ransacked his home
[3:12:46.720 --> 3:12:51.920]  and potentially harmed his three-year-old kid macron has also repeatedly failed to address a
[3:12:51.920 --> 3:12:57.680]  central election issue throughout the debates mass immigration while the pen has largely
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:13:02.880]  skirted around the issue it's been left to intellectual firebrand eric zemore to pick
[3:13:02.880 --> 3:13:08.000]  up the slack zemore vowed to create a ministry of re-migration which would send migrants with
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:13.440]  criminal records back home while former french intelligence chief pierre broshan the equivalent
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:19.200]  of the head of the cia recently warned in an interview that quote all multicultural societies
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:25.280]  are doomed but macron himself dismissed the issue claiming that france isn't being submerged and
[3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:30.640]  that zero immigration isn't an option but that isn't a view shared by much of the french electorate
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:35.040]  a harris interactive poll found a majority of french believe europeans are being replaced by
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:40.320]  non- europeans 63% in a separate poll thought there were quote too many immigrants in france
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:46.640]  and an ifop survey found that 70% of french believe all immigration should be halted macron
[3:13:46.640 --> 3:13:52.160]  is still favorite to beat le pen but his sheer tone deafness to one of the most important issues
[3:13:52.160 --> 3:14:03.200]  to french voters could just end up costing him the presidency now the regime again just like the
[3:14:03.200 --> 3:14:08.880]  world employees of twitter and again if if you're worried about you know elon musk having an influence
[3:14:08.880 --> 3:14:15.040]  on the policies or the rules of twitter just create your own social media network right twitter's a
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:20.960]  private company it can do what it wants they're in panic that's good the regime are also in panic
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:27.200]  about this poll and marine le pen potentially beating globalist candidate macron there's a
[3:14:27.200 --> 3:14:33.040]  headline out of the new republic it says yes be worried marine le pen could finally come to
[3:14:33.040 --> 3:14:39.520]  power in france oh my god the french people could democratically elect a leader that the regime
[3:14:39.520 --> 3:14:46.160]  doesn't like oh we can't have that the manual macron five-year term as president is drawing to
[3:14:46.160 --> 3:14:53.680]  a close it says and then it goes on in the article to express absolute horror and dread at the prospect
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:15:00.000]  of marine le pen beating immanuel macron so when they're coming out with headlines like that in
[3:15:00.000 --> 3:15:08.080]  globalist publications like the new republic you know that the regime is scared meanwhile in sweden
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:14.480]  they're also enjoying the benefits of diversity and multiculturalism right bar reports sweden fatal
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:23.280]  shootings in first three months of 2022 over triple that of 2021 now remember 20 years ago sweden was
[3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:30.080]  the most safe the safest country in europe and the entire continent now it's the second most
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:36.880]  dangerous in terms of gun crime after croatia now what happened in the space of that 20 years
[3:15:36.880 --> 3:15:41.760]  to make sweden more dangerous does it have anything to do with the fact that they accepted
[3:15:41.760 --> 3:15:48.800]  vast numbers of migrants from the middle eastern north africa now they're having even greater problems
[3:15:48.800 --> 3:15:53.200]  with crime and with violence we'll be back summit dot news don't go away

[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:43.760]  in the french election well prime minister orban in hungary and other populist won in a landslide
[3:20:43.760 --> 3:20:50.880]  a few days ago in hungary and now the eu is sanctioning hungary because hungarians
[3:20:50.880 --> 3:20:58.480]  democratically elected a prime minister how dare they that the eu doesn't like this is eu
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:04.240]  punishes hungary for electing orban here's the clip if there was ever any doubt as to the eu
[3:21:04.240 --> 3:21:10.320]  being a horrendous authoritarian anachronism they're now sanctioning hungary because hungarians
[3:21:10.320 --> 3:21:16.400]  elected a prime minister that the eu doesn't like yeah really on sunday prime minister victor
[3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:21.760]  orban was returned to office with a landslide victory you mean to say hungarians used their
[3:21:21.760 --> 3:21:27.920]  democratic vote to democratically elect a leader of their choice someone who actually represents
[3:21:27.920 --> 3:21:33.360]  the interests of the hungarian people and not faceless eu globalist superstate technocrats
[3:21:33.360 --> 3:21:38.480]  oh no we can't have that in response the eu announced it would use an extraordinary new
[3:21:38.480 --> 3:21:45.280]  mechanism to cut funding to hungary to be clear the eu is directly punishing ordinary hardworking
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:51.600]  hungarians who chose to vote for orban as well as those who didn't vote for orban millions of euros
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:56.240]  that would have gone to pay for building roads funding schools and covering medical care will
[3:21:56.240 --> 3:22:02.560]  now be vindictively snatched away and this all happened after billionaire globalist oligarch
[3:22:02.560 --> 3:22:10.160]  george soros demanded that hungary be made a quote test case in other words be made an example of
[3:22:10.160 --> 3:22:17.920]  because hungary refused to bow to the eu commission's supposed quote values namely wide open borders
[3:22:17.920 --> 3:22:24.800]  and mandatory lgbt teaching in classrooms the eu was big mad that hungary's national assembly
[3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:29.840]  passed a law banning the promotion of material related to homosexuality or transgenderism in
[3:22:29.840 --> 3:22:35.600]  education on television movies or in advertisements no no don't you dare try and impede the regime's
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:42.800]  indoctrination of your kids even via a parliamentary vote or will financially sabotage your country
[3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:47.920]  should we really be surprised that the eu still behaves like a dictatorship this is the same
[3:22:47.920 --> 3:22:54.080]  body that when the french voted in a majority to reject the eu constitution back in 2005 the
[3:22:54.080 --> 3:23:00.000]  french political class and the eu simply adopted it anyway under the lisbon treaty which was
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:06.320]  virtually identical then when the irish rejected the lisbon treaty in 2008 the eu simply made them
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:12.000]  vote on it again in 2009 until they got the result they wanted turns out that unelected
[3:23:12.000 --> 3:23:18.080]  bureaucrats don't like the idea of people having to be voted into power by an electorate imagine
[3:23:18.080 --> 3:23:24.320]  my shock the eu is a disgusting foul beast that should be consigned to the ash heap of history
[3:23:24.320 --> 3:23:33.040]  we need brexit continent-wide and we need it asap that wraps up the situation in europe now
[3:23:33.040 --> 3:23:38.960]  want to switch to covid because we don't have long left absolutely mad situation in shanghai where
[3:23:38.960 --> 3:23:44.960]  they have another lockdown indefinite lockdown zero covid has been a complete disaster this is the
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:52.880]  clip revolt in shanghai against new lockdown madness here it is we're now seeing open revolt from the
[3:23:52.880 --> 3:23:59.040]  normally submissive compliant chinese in response to yet another new lockdown in shanghai the city's
[3:23:59.040 --> 3:24:04.000]  26 million residents were initially placed under a nine-day lockdown but now that has
[3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:08.400]  been extended indefinitely but they're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore
[3:24:08.400 --> 3:24:13.280]  even faced with the prospect of losing points from their precious social credit scores they've
[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:17.920]  simply had enough the breaking point appears to have been disgraceful scenes showing children
[3:24:17.920 --> 3:24:24.160]  being separated from their parents inside quarantine facilities social media shows children even
[3:24:24.160 --> 3:24:30.160]  infants separated from their families at a shanghai hospital after testing positive for covid-19
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:36.560]  isolated alone crying as well as people being prevented from going out to buy food or seeking
[3:24:36.560 --> 3:24:42.240]  urgent medical care anger is reaching a boiling point in shanghai chinese social media showing
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:48.960]  residents in lockdown protesting chanting we want jobs we want freedom hundreds in one
[3:24:48.960 --> 3:24:54.400]  shanghai neighborhood broke out of confinement pleading for affordable food this resident
[3:24:54.400 --> 3:25:00.480]  confronts the police yelling why are we being starved they're not even allowed out for exercise
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:05.760]  residents aren't even allowed to briefly step outside cnn filmed this man walking in his
[3:25:05.760 --> 3:25:11.840]  apartment compound he was immediately escorted back home people are dropping dead in the street
[3:25:11.840 --> 3:25:17.200]  because ambulance workers are refusing to get out and treat them a woman is screaming in desperation
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:24.080]  for the paramedic to help an asthma patient his heart has stopped she said pleading to borrow
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:30.640]  the ambulance's defibrillator but the paramedics refuse to help but what cnn won't tell you is
[3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:35.840]  why shanghai is in this mess because unlike other european countries who have chosen to
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:41.760]  live with covid and get on with life china has pursued a disastrous zero covid policy
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:47.760]  which ensures that the rolling lockdowns will never end we were told 80 of adults in shanghai
[3:25:47.760 --> 3:25:52.800]  had been fully vaccinated and this was in august last year that was supposed to provide them with
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:58.720]  quote herd immunity yet shanghai just experienced more covid cases in the previous four weeks
[3:25:58.720 --> 3:26:04.400]  than during the entire previous two years of the pandemic 100 safe and effective and remember
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:10.240]  all this is in response to omicron despite months and months of data from other countries proving
[3:26:10.240 --> 3:26:15.600]  it to be milder than previous variants shanghai residents are appearing at their balconies in
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:21.760]  unison to sing protest songs only to be confronted by drones with loudspeakers telling them to go
[3:26:21.760 --> 3:26:39.440]  back inside there's also reports of the government forcibly euthanizing the pets of
[3:26:39.440 --> 3:26:46.880]  covid infectees unless we forget china's draconian lockdown was the model for western countries two
[3:26:46.880 --> 3:26:53.040]  years ago professor lockdown neil ferguson said on record quote it's a communist one party state
[3:26:53.040 --> 3:26:58.640]  we said we couldn't get away with it in europe we thought and then italy did it and we realized
[3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:04.960]  we could lockdowns are and always were a devastating moral outrage and just because we've learned to
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:10.560]  live with covid in the west doesn't mean those who promoted and implemented the horrors of lockdown
[3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:17.760]  shouldn't be held responsible and investigated and if necessary prosecuted for the horrendous damage
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:26.000]  they've done to society now bear in mind that you have the irony of cnn siding with these
[3:27:26.000 --> 3:27:32.160]  chinese protesters who are quote crying about their freedom and their jobs cnn being the same
[3:27:32.160 --> 3:27:37.520]  network who lobbied in the west in the united states for the past two years for lockdown
[3:27:37.520 --> 3:27:44.240]  which cost people jobs businesses and their freedom so for cnn to you know get in there like
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:49.520]  they're the moral arbiter like they're the uh the great defender of freedom and jobs against
[3:27:49.520 --> 3:27:55.680]  lockdown is absolutely hilarious but again that shows in china the complete disaster that zero
[3:27:55.680 --> 3:28:03.680]  covid policies have meanwhile daily skeptic reports babies struggling with facial expressions
[3:28:03.680 --> 3:28:08.880]  after months of lockdown and masks this is an official report by the off-stead organization
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:16.560]  and again i still see kids outside there's no that doesn't mean any mask rules in england for three
[3:28:16.560 --> 3:28:23.920]  months parents have their kids outside wearing masks it's literally retarding them it's retarding
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:30.800]  other babies and toddlers based on its analysis off-stead reported delays in babies and children's
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:35.920]  speech and language development and the fact that some babies have struggled to respond to basic
[3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:42.000]  facial expressions so all the people who claim the moral high ground by making kids wear masks
[3:28:42.000 --> 3:28:48.560]  are actually stunting their cognitive development they need to stop it and realize the gross harm
[3:28:48.560 --> 3:28:52.000]  that they're doing summit dot news we'll be back don't go away

[3:33:22.880 --> 3:33:28.800]  he is michael dill abroad from the telegram channel bohanca watch he is following primary sources on
[3:33:28.800 --> 3:33:34.720]  the ground in ukraine both pro russia pro ukraine yes both sides in wars have propaganda
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:40.800]  incredible that may be and we have another story here of course on monday we were talking about the
[3:33:42.720 --> 3:33:47.760]  alleged war crimes committed by russian troops i'm going to get to any update on that later on
[3:33:47.760 --> 3:33:54.000]  in the showing booker but now we have the return of yet another fake news story and that is russian
[3:33:54.000 --> 3:33:59.280]  mobile crematoriums headline viral russian mobile crematorium tweet is from an eight-year-old
[3:33:59.280 --> 3:34:05.440]  youtube video this circled at the beginning of the war and it's doing the rounds yet again
[3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:13.040]  no warning label slapped on this viral tweet from a news agency that claims as a mobile
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:19.520]  crematorium in maria paul you go and reverse search the image and already did it a month ago
[3:34:19.520 --> 3:34:25.280]  because this came out a month ago was debunked now it's back again and it's from a youtube video
[3:34:25.280 --> 3:34:32.400]  from a dumpster from eight years ago now on the flip side of this they are claiming in maria paul
[3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:38.640]  the mayor and other officials are claiming that there's basically a quote new auschwitz that's
[3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:46.240]  happened with quote tens of thousands of bodies being burned by the russians to cover up a massacre
[3:34:46.240 --> 3:34:51.600]  now whether that's happening or not we'll get into it what i know is not evidence of that
[3:34:51.600 --> 3:34:58.320]  is a tweet which has gone viral showing a dumpster from eight years ago from a screenshotted youtube
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:06.000]  video that is not evidence of tens of thousands of people being burned in maria paul and yet i put
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:12.320]  this out on twitter and some of the respondents were like oh well it's just a stock image ball
[3:35:12.320 --> 3:35:19.920]  if i posted an image of russians being slaughtered by ukrainians and it was from 2014
[3:35:20.480 --> 3:35:25.360]  they'd pull me up on that like you'd never believe they'd say i was engaging fake news
[3:35:25.360 --> 3:35:31.040]  they'd twitter would slap it with a fact check or they'd make me delete the tweet they do it
[3:35:31.040 --> 3:35:35.520]  on a whim and they get away with it i just refresh the tweet nothing's happened to it it's still gone
[3:35:35.520 --> 3:35:40.240]  viral there's still a bunch of people below it saying oh my god this is a new auschwitz it's a
[3:35:40.240 --> 3:35:46.640]  screenshot from an eight-year-old youtube video michael welcome back to the show what is the latest
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.040]  on what is happening in maria paul these claims of a new auschwitz and what do you think about this
[3:35:53.680 --> 3:36:00.000]  once again debunked fake news story about this mobile crematorium circling on twitter going
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:07.120]  viral and not being fact checked by the esteemed fact checkers tell us what's going on yeah thank
[3:36:07.120 --> 3:36:12.640]  you very much for having me back on paul so uh yeah as you outlined this is an allegation that's
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:19.200]  now allegedly what's happening in maria paul for people who aren't aware on the fourth day so the
[3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.400]  28th of february maria paul was surrounded by the russian army and since then it has been subject
[3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:30.560]  to siege for the past coming up to around about a month and a half now it has been quite a brutal
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:37.920]  siege there's been a lot of killing and death on both sides in terms of the claims of that the
[3:36:37.920 --> 3:36:44.240]  specific allegations that you're addressing um yeah if this is actually what is happening it would be
[3:36:44.240 --> 3:36:49.520]  one of the best kept secrets that the russians have been able to sustain throughout this war and
[3:36:50.160 --> 3:36:56.240]  the russians haven't been very good at keeping various things secret so from my understanding
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:01.280]  the specific allegations seem to come from the mayor of maria paul from a vadim boychenko
[3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:08.000]  from my understanding is he has not been in the city since essentially before it was actually
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:15.760]  surrounded and besieged and most of the city council fled the city before the the siege began so
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:20.800]  that's not precluding that they don't have contacts within the city of course they do but
[3:37:20.800 --> 3:37:30.000]  they have provided no that i have been able to see anyway no validation no proof of these alleged
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:35.600]  mobile crematoria going on that's apparently operating within the city and if these are operating
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:41.040]  in the city they are not doing a very good job to put it bluntly i don't particularly want to get
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:47.440]  very grisly into what's been happening in maria paul but it has been a very brutal battle and
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:53.280]  unfortunately there has been significant civilian casualties and anyone who's been following the
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:59.760]  events of maria paul and in this part of the war for any length of time will know that every day
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:06.480]  there is a constant stream of footage coming out of the city um the russians themselves are releasing
[3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:11.360]  footage the isov and ukrainian troops within the city whenever they had the the ability to they
[3:38:11.360 --> 3:38:16.960]  were releasing footage uh kadirov ramzam kadirovs fighters the chetchins are constantly filming
[3:38:16.960 --> 3:38:21.600]  stuff in the city and ironically uploading it the tech talk there's independent journalists
[3:38:22.480 --> 3:38:28.960]  through that footage it is quite evident that there are the civilians who have been killed
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:34.800]  they're usually left to lay on the streets for a number of days until other civilians come and
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:41.040]  basically bury them within the city parks or beside the roads i've not seen any evidence of
[3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:47.360]  of these crematory operating um if they if they are operating someone somewhere would have filmed
[3:38:47.360 --> 3:38:53.120]  them because the vehicle from the youtube video that that's purported to be from is very distinctive
[3:38:53.120 --> 3:38:59.440]  it does not look like any of the other russian military vehicles be it uh more western and ukrainian
[3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:05.600]  aligned open source internet investigators be it russians or donetsk fighters themselves
[3:39:05.600 --> 3:39:09.920]  they would have picked up on on the presence of this vehicle and there's been no footage at all
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:14.240]  that i have seen not to say it isn't happening but it would be one of the best cap secrets that
[3:39:14.240 --> 3:39:18.640]  the russians have been able to keep onto their their shirts so far during this conflict
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.240]  yeah i've got i've got a headline here from lbc and again i talked about it on monday
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:30.800]  they literally had reports come out in legacy media outlets during the invasion of iraq saying
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:38.800]  400 000 dead in mass grave turned out to be complete bs this lbc headline again no one's
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:44.400]  denying that there are there's death and carnage it's a war but the way they're framing it the
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:51.520]  headline is the new auschwitz bodies of 10 000 ukrainian civilians incinerated and then the
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:57.040]  mayor as he said boychenko comes out and says quote the world has not seen the scale of the
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:02.560]  tragedy in maria pulsans the existence of nazi concentration camps they're actually going
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:10.240]  with this full-scale propaganda on the level of auschwitz and if you type in mobile crematoriums
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:16.560]  to google news there's literally hundreds of news stories just repeating it ad infinitum and again
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:22.160]  we've had the ghost of kiev force obviously we've had the alleged slaughter of ukrainian soldiers
[3:40:22.160 --> 3:40:26.400]  on snake island didn't happen they peacefully surrendered we had the attack on a holocaust
[3:40:26.400 --> 3:40:33.840]  memorial in kiev never happened we've got this on twitter i mean listen listen to the responses to
[3:40:33.840 --> 3:40:40.640]  this tweet which is still up it's got 11 000 likes 7 000 plus retweets being seen hundreds of thousands
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:46.800]  of times the responses this is auschwitz on wheels the horrors being unleashed are on a par if not
[3:40:46.800 --> 3:40:51.840]  worse than what the nazis did someone else says nothing to see here just russian mobile crematorium
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:40:57.520]  entering european cities it's a dumpster from eight years ago now we know why they're doing this
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:04.560]  because they want the no-fly zone they want the escalation in fact i posted this and within two
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:11.600]  minutes someone had responded calling me a russian bot like no i'm a real person i'm literally
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:16.880]  responding and whether you call me a russian bot or not you're engaging in bot behavior by responding
[3:41:16.880 --> 3:41:21.680]  within two seconds by saying that and it's a screenshot from an eight-year-old youtube video
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:27.600]  whoever tells you that or not gonna come back on the other side michael but i want to get into
[3:41:27.600 --> 3:41:33.440]  again updates on bucker i want to get into this pentagon says russia ukraine war is likely to
[3:41:33.440 --> 3:41:39.360]  last for years this was a house armed services committee where mark milley the chair of the
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:45.040]  joint chiefs of staff said that the war will last for years it could escalate which is interesting
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:51.280]  because that ties into this headline washington post admits nato wants to prolong war in ukraine
[3:41:52.000 --> 3:41:58.320]  this was a washington post article where they admitted they wanted to weaken demoralize and
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:05.200]  drain russia by having it fight in ukraine for the foreseeable future so of course that's going
[3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:11.360]  to equate to more people on both sides of the conflict dying so we've got forces within nato
[3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:17.040]  wanting to prolong the conflict they don't want a peace deal and we've got uh members of the u.s
[3:42:17.040 --> 3:42:23.680]  military industrial complex saying the same thing that the war is going to go on for years i also
[3:42:23.680 --> 3:42:28.320]  want to come back briefly in the next segment and talk with michael about this new york times
[3:42:28.320 --> 3:42:33.760]  verifies video showing ukrainian troops killing russian prisoners of war near bucker so we've
[3:42:33.760 --> 3:42:40.240]  got the ny times now basically saying that yes prisoners of war are being slaughtered in violation
[3:42:40.240 --> 3:42:45.520]  of the jeven janiva convention by ukrainian troops that didn't circulate very far out of the new
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:52.560]  york times unlike these allegations of literal auschwitz level war crimes in maria poll we'll
[3:42:52.560 --> 3:43:00.880]  be back don't go away i want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part founder series at
[3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:07.440]  1776 coin dot com remphalor store dot com and the second installment is the tree of liberty
[3:43:07.440 --> 3:43:12.320]  thomas shiverson quote must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants the coin i designed
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:18.160]  i'm very very proud of it and it will end up being a collectible i know that the first coin is already
[3:43:18.160 --> 3:43:24.640]  selling on ebay and other places for three times what we sold it we need to sell all 10 000 of these
[3:43:24.640 --> 3:43:29.680]  very very quickly and i appreciate listeners are getting over half of them now i'd like to
[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:35.280]  lose them out very quickly i think they will sell out probably in five or six more days and without
[3:43:35.280 --> 3:43:40.400]  the last coin sale we would not be operating at the same capacity we've had to lay off a lot of
[3:43:40.400 --> 3:43:44.400]  people and had some big problems so it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political

[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:02.880]  our world is so full of hype we're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[3:44:02.880 --> 3:44:09.120]  by the controlled churches and the universities why is this the case because we innately by god
[3:44:09.920 --> 3:44:15.040]  have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls and by connecting to god
[3:44:15.040 --> 3:44:22.480]  we can empower ourselves and trend sin the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:29.120]  ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering
[3:44:29.120 --> 3:44:34.240]  us they're only making us depressed and the end they're only making us less filled it is only by
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:39.280]  going within and really making that connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves that's
[3:44:39.280 --> 3:44:44.240]  why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins

[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:13.600]  you're listening to summit dot news with paul joseph watson
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:20.720]  well i've been talking to michael de la brot who runs the telegram channel
[3:47:20.720 --> 3:47:27.360]  or hanker watching you should all go and follow that channel on telegram because he has the latest
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:33.840]  breaking news from primary underground sources in ukraine both pro ukraine pro russian to try to
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:40.640]  figure out which propaganda is closer to the truth in any given situation of course that varies
[3:47:41.600 --> 3:47:48.000]  but michael we've talked about the fake tweet of alleged russian mobile crematoriums those claims
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:55.520]  are ongoing any updates on this alleged russian massacre of civilians in bucker and then your
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:48:01.920]  take on this headline new york times verifies video showing ukrainian troops killing russian
[3:48:01.920 --> 3:48:07.600]  prisoners of war near bucker says the video was posted on monday depicts the killing of a wounded
[3:48:07.600 --> 3:48:11.600]  russian soldier who was still breathing before he was shot three times of course we had that
[3:48:11.600 --> 3:48:18.000]  previous video from a couple of weekends ago showing russian pow's being shot in the arm shot
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:24.320]  in the knee left to die in agony uh with ukrainians filming that and thinking that it'd be a good idea
[3:48:24.320 --> 3:48:31.280]  to put it on social media so any developments on bucker since we last talked about it on monday
[3:48:31.280 --> 3:48:37.680]  and what do you make of this situation near near bucker where russian troops or russian prisoners
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:45.840]  of war apparently killed by ukrainian soldiers yeah so unfortunately in terms of the busher
[3:48:45.840 --> 3:48:51.840]  incident and the events around european and hostile of it as far as i can see there there really
[3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:57.840]  isn't much more to be gleaned from it is the various satellite footage have come out to
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:04.240]  that said to corroborate various pro ukrainian claims but other than that it's just become
[3:49:04.240 --> 3:49:10.320]  this situation where western media pro ukrainian media have just effectively completely swamped
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:16.080]  out the narrative so unless there is an actual proper forensic investigation into the specific
[3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:22.560]  events in bucker i don't think we're really going to get to an actual definitive truth
[3:49:23.200 --> 3:49:27.760]  proven by the forensics and by the science that can be gleaned from the events itself
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:33.840]  unfortunately as as i've just said the media narrative has been been established and that
[3:49:33.840 --> 3:49:39.520]  seems to have completely crowded out and swamped any any ability to try and discern what is alleged
[3:49:39.520 --> 3:49:45.040]  to have happened one way or the other of course as we were saying on monday the the russian ministry
[3:49:45.040 --> 3:49:50.480]  of defense is very strongly protesting and and disputing pretty much any allegations at all
[3:49:50.480 --> 3:49:56.160]  from bucker which i think is probably a bit bit too strong i do believe that there are instances
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:00.880]  in in butcher where it is very likely that the russians have engaged in various allegations
[3:50:01.520 --> 3:50:08.960]  and war criminal war crimes but in terms of the wider events around the town it it like i say
[3:50:08.960 --> 3:50:13.680]  until there's a proper investigation by an independent body it's it's i don't think we're
[3:50:13.680 --> 3:50:16.640]  really going to be able to ascertain it one way or the other at this stage
[3:50:19.520 --> 3:50:24.640]  and give us the latest on what's happening on the ground today because i mentioned um
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:29.440]  washington post i've been to nato wants the pro long war in ukraine you have the pentagon
[3:50:30.320 --> 3:50:34.320]  testifying joint chiefs of staff are basically saying it's going to last for years
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:40.320]  are they any closer to a peace deal and what are the main stories to arise in the past couple of
[3:50:40.320 --> 3:50:47.520]  days in terms of what's going on on the ground then okay so just to quickly try and wrap it up
[3:50:48.640 --> 3:50:53.280]  in terms of what's actually because it's quite a broad question and there's a lot of stuff going on
[3:50:53.280 --> 3:51:00.000]  but yes this this war is i'm expecting at least to be around about six to nine months uh from
[3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:04.400]  where we are at the moment it's currently mud season in ukraine that's slowing everything down
[3:51:04.400 --> 3:51:09.200]  until the summer sun comes and dries out the the ground the russians are not going to be able to
[3:51:09.200 --> 3:51:14.320]  pull off massive advances and maneuvers like they did at the start of the war in terms of a peace deal
[3:51:14.320 --> 3:51:19.920]  i i've noticed over the past month that there has been a softening in the ukrainian position on
[3:51:19.920 --> 3:51:26.800]  certain issues most noticeably the zealinsky and kiav have dropped any pretense that they could
[3:51:26.800 --> 3:51:33.920]  ever join nato and there was an interesting sort of soft rate softening of their dialogue in terms of
[3:51:33.920 --> 3:51:41.520]  Crimea but in terms of the Donbass and Donetsk and Lugansk as far as i can see the ukrainians
[3:51:41.520 --> 3:51:48.160]  are still strongly holding to their they refuse to budge on that issue what is likely to happen
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:53.040]  over the next couple months is the russians are building up their strength quite strongly in the
[3:51:53.040 --> 3:51:59.760]  east of the country they are bringing in fresh troops from the Siberia from the far east fresh
[3:51:59.760 --> 3:52:04.960]  equipment from across russia they're redeploying their troops from the war engaged in Kiev and
[3:52:04.960 --> 3:52:11.760]  churnigov and sunday they're being redeployed into the Donbass sector and it could be the decisive
[3:52:11.760 --> 3:52:15.760]  battle of the war but the russians and the ukrainians know they're doing it and they're
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:19.920]  trying to prepare for it but the russians are building up for a massive offensive that is to
[3:52:19.920 --> 3:52:24.880]  completely take over the Donbass achieve the territorial extent of the Lugansk and Donetsk
[3:52:24.880 --> 3:52:31.200]  republics in in many ways whenever it does come to negotiations it's a faith accompli
[3:52:31.200 --> 3:52:36.320]  is ukraine will effectively be dealt with a hand you don't control this territory at all
[3:52:36.320 --> 3:52:40.160]  you've been completely defeated here and pushed out so why are you still holding on to it the
[3:52:40.160 --> 3:52:45.920]  problem there is the russians at that stage could feel that they have committed too much men they've
[3:52:45.920 --> 3:52:51.360]  lost too much blood and they've lost too much equipment that the russians might interestingly
[3:52:51.360 --> 3:52:56.240]  i've seen some developments in hurson in zaporosia the russians might actually extend what they're
[3:52:56.240 --> 3:53:03.360]  looking for into sovereign ukraine for various reasons okay michael we're going to leave it
[3:53:03.360 --> 3:53:08.320]  there we'll be sure to have you back but the telegram channel is bohanka watch or you can search
[3:53:08.320 --> 3:53:14.880]  for his name michael dillabrot on telegram be sure to follow that channel for the latest
[3:53:14.880 --> 3:53:21.840]  breaking updates michael thanks again we'll have you back soon no problem thank you pa okay we're
[3:53:21.840 --> 3:53:26.160]  going to go to some final news stories but first i want to throw to this video because i've been
[3:53:26.160 --> 3:53:29.840]  trying to play it for days basically finally got the chance here at the end of the show quick two
[3:53:29.840 --> 3:53:34.960]  minute video this is keep them docile with drugs and video games wait till you hear what the man
[3:53:34.960 --> 3:53:42.480]  cited by the elite as one of the greatest living thinkers of the 21st century thinks about humanity
[3:53:42.480 --> 3:53:49.520]  here's the clip historian professor and author uval harari is listed as an agenda contributor
[3:53:49.520 --> 3:53:55.040]  to the world economic forum he's also cited by virtually every technocrat and elitist worth their
[3:53:55.040 --> 3:54:00.400]  soul they laboriously shower him with praise heralding him as one of the 21st century's greatest
[3:54:00.400 --> 3:54:06.240]  thinkers so should it concern us that uval harari thinks that most of the population are quote
[3:54:06.240 --> 3:54:12.480]  hackable animals who need to be kept docile via drugs and video games yeah that might be a worry
[3:54:12.480 --> 3:54:19.280]  and then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be what do we need humans
[3:54:19.280 --> 3:54:25.680]  for or at least what do we need so many humans for beyond wage slave migrants to service harari
[3:54:25.680 --> 3:54:32.960]  and his globalist buddies apparently nothing at present the best guess we have is keep them happy
[3:54:32.960 --> 3:54:37.760]  with drugs and computer games and we call this the metaverse but don't worry the elite really
[3:54:37.760 --> 3:54:42.560]  care about you mean one of their biggest heroes literally said you're all useless eaters but
[3:54:42.560 --> 3:54:48.640]  i'm sure he didn't mean it would constitute a new useless class when i say that these are useless
[3:54:48.640 --> 3:54:53.440]  humans harari previously stated that voters don't know what's best for them that the elite will soon
[3:54:53.440 --> 3:54:58.960]  be able to hack into people's brains that there needs to be quote an anti-virus for the brain to
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:05.040]  prevent people being infected with fake news that there is no free will or god no heaven or hell
[3:55:05.040 --> 3:55:10.080]  and that while the elite themselves will become gods via transhumanism most of the rest of us
[3:55:10.080 --> 3:55:16.480]  will soon quote disappear and to emphasize this is the guy that the elite thinks is one of the
[3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:22.960]  greatest thinkers of the 21st century but yeah i'm sure they really have your best interests at heart
[3:55:22.960 --> 3:55:30.960]  a new useless class well there you have it let's go to some final news stories here because the
[3:55:30.960 --> 3:55:38.080]  wave of russophobia continues to sweep the globe where russian culture in a broad sweep
[3:55:38.080 --> 3:55:44.320]  is subject to cancellation headline britain's national gallery changes name of 19th century
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:49.440]  painting due to quote current situation got to support the current thing the british national
[3:55:49.440 --> 3:55:54.880]  gallery has changed the name of a 19th century painting by french impressionist edgar daga
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:56:00.800]  from russian dancers to ukrainian dancers due to the quote current situation why did they change
[3:56:00.800 --> 3:56:08.640]  the name of the painting because one activist wrote a little whining about it yeah that's enough
[3:56:08.640 --> 3:56:14.960]  the activist described it as a micro victory of course we had the previous cancellation of
[3:56:14.960 --> 3:56:22.240]  dos doyevsky who of course got cancelled in melanne university on dos doyevsky we've had
[3:56:22.240 --> 3:56:29.120]  pianists we've had conductors world famous being cancelled basically their careers are ruined because
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:34.880]  they were born on a piece of land called russia we've had the world number one medvedev the tennis
[3:56:34.880 --> 3:56:41.440]  player being asked to publicly denounce putin basically being ideological subservient to
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:47.040]  whatever the regime narrative wants at the time very dangerous precedent to set if he's allowed
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:54.720]  to compete at the wimbledon tennis taun meanwhile twitter bans x un weapons inspector over ukraine
[3:56:54.720 --> 3:57:00.960]  this is former u.s marine corps officer scott ritter who of course was instrumental in exposing the
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:06.240]  lies behind the weapons of mass destruction hoax and boy did they target him for that afterwards
[3:57:06.240 --> 3:57:12.800]  he's now been permanently suspended from twitter basically because he dared to challenge the regime
[3:57:12.800 --> 3:57:20.080]  narrative in terms of the booker quote massacre that happened near Kiev so now basically the
[3:57:20.080 --> 3:57:27.520]  standard has been set if you dare go against regime nato narratives you are subject to cancellation
[3:57:27.520 --> 3:57:33.600]  and deletion meanwhile spotify announcers russia exit date yes if you're russian you won't be able
