[00:30.000 --> 00:40.000]  I will remember the love of souls that you want to make
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  Now I watch the falling rain
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  All my mind you see now
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  I will remember the love of souls that you want to make
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  All my mind you see now
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  I'm sure
[01:02.000 --> 01:04.000]  Well I guess you took my youth
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  And gave it all away
[01:08.000 --> 01:10.000]  Like the birth of a new voucher
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  There's nobody in the range
[01:14.000 --> 01:16.000]  And when she died
[01:16.000 --> 01:18.000]  I couldn't cry
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  The pie was in my soul
[01:20.000 --> 01:24.000]  You left me in your place
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  But I know it was never enough
[01:28.000 --> 01:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:30.000 --> 01:33.000]  We are live on this Friday
[01:33.000 --> 01:37.000]  April 1st transmission
[01:37.000 --> 01:41.000]  And we see the April Fool, the puppet president
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  Just blithering and bumbling around
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  It is so sad
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  There'll be no April Fool's here
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  Much too serious of a world
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  Well there is obviously a lot of huge news
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  But folks also tune in here
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  To get tomorrow's news today
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  Next month's news today
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  Next year's news today
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  And I don't like what I see in my crystal ball
[02:08.000 --> 02:12.000]  But it is better that we know what's coming
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  Or what the enemy would like to do
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  So as we can make preparation for it
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  But we knew this was coming
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  Even the United Nations has come out today
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  And warned that the world is on the verge of economic collapse
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  Due to food prices exploding
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  Energy prices exploding
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  And that the Middle East is at a breaking point
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  The last time this happened was the Arab Spring
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Eight and a half, nine years ago
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  Caused by the last time food prices went
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Just somewhere near
[02:50.000 --> 02:53.000]  This price, energy prices did not get this high
[02:53.000 --> 02:55.000]  And you're seeing that in Africa
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  You're seeing that in Latin America
[02:57.000 --> 02:59.000]  You're seeing it all over the world
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  Many countries are having to turn off their street lights at night
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  And this is just the beginning of the great reset
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  Meanwhile, Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Is putting on an event over in the Middle East right now
[03:13.000 --> 03:18.000]  And they're bragging at their big event
[03:18.000 --> 03:20.000]  Their World Government Summit
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  That it is the end of the currency
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  So as you know it, there will be a new global digital central bank currency
[03:28.000 --> 03:33.000]  That's programmable, that will track and control everything you do
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  So we're going to be going over that ongoing World Government Summit
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  That's taking place
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  And we have the clips of them announcing the new global currency
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  Announcing the new world order
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  Announcing that they're going to transgender your child
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  I mean, this is the end of the species as we know it
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  If they get these things in place
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  I mean, this is biblical
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  And of course, your mainline, megachurch
[04:02.000 --> 04:04.000]  Is not going to tell you about this
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  They're going to help implant you with the new digital tattoo
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  When it all rolls out
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  Because after all, that's how they're going to get their donations
[04:10.000 --> 04:12.000]  And those of us that won't go along with it
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  Well, we can starve in a reeducation camp
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  So
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  That's just some of what we're going to be laying out here
[04:30.000 --> 04:37.000]  And I'm also, of course, going to be taking your phone calls today
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  And we have some special guests in the studio as well
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  The third hour, but I will be giving the phone number out this hour
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  We'll be going to your phone calls during this first hour
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  So I'm going to be taking a lot of calls today
[04:48.000 --> 04:51.000]  Infowars.com is still up and running
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  Show us band.video, reaching millions of people
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  Thanks to your support
[04:55.000 --> 04:58.000]  I suggest you use those links and videos to tell the truth
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  In December of 2021
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  Infowars offered the first in a three-part series
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.000]  And it sold out in 10 days
[05:11.000 --> 05:15.000]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin
[05:15.000 --> 05:19.000]  A founding member coin, we would not be on air today
[05:19.000 --> 05:23.000]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin
[05:23.000 --> 05:27.000]  Is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again
[05:27.000 --> 05:29.000]  It certainly needs to to fund our operation
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  It is so historic
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.000]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  It's also at infowarsstore.com
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them
[05:47.000 --> 05:50.000]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air
[05:50.000 --> 05:53.000]  We're planning something very, very special for everyone
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  That helps us go to the next level
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  At 1776coin.com
[06:29.000 --> 06:32.000]  It's a big to Brzezinski and Cecil Rhodes, of course
[06:32.000 --> 06:35.000]  100 years before they wrote their books
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  Planning this scientific worldwide dictatorship
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Planning this new world order
[06:40.000 --> 06:44.000]  And I remember thinking, man, I guess my job
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.000]  Will be trying to stop this because obviously this is a very
[06:47.000 --> 06:52.000]  Oppressive, anti-human, predatory system
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.000]  And so
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  I poked around and tried to get a job and talk radio
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Right out of high school, I went and gave little speeches
[07:00.000 --> 07:03.000]  At county commission and seen council meetings
[07:03.000 --> 07:05.000]  And by the time I was 21
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  I started an access television show
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  And then a year later got a local radio show
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  And the rest was history
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  But I remember wondering what it would be like
[07:14.000 --> 07:17.000]  If they started imploding the world economy
[07:17.000 --> 07:19.000]  If they set up their post-industrial world
[07:19.000 --> 07:21.000]  What that process would be like
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Because when I was reading U.N. biological diversity assessment
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.000]  Plans and some of the books and transcripts of U.N. meetings
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  Like the Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  When George Herbert Walker Bush signed us on
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  To agenda 21 treating
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  It was never ratified, but the bureaucracy followed it
[07:42.000 --> 07:47.000]  And reading about depopulation of at least 80%
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  And using different ways of promoting new lifestyles
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  To get rid of the family and atomizing the public
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  Making us be totally alone
[07:56.000 --> 07:59.000]  And just reading this and thinking, man
[07:59.000 --> 08:03.000]  What will this look like if they succeed?
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  And then seeing articles everywhere telling people
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  That if anybody tells you they're a plan
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.000]  For a one-world government run by the U.N. and private corporations
[08:12.000 --> 08:15.000]  If anybody tells you they're going to have forced inoculations
[08:15.000 --> 08:18.000]  If anybody tells you they're going to cut off fossil fuels
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  If anybody tells you they're going to take away air conditioning
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  And people's cars
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  That person is a anti-Semite
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  What's that to do with Jews?
[08:27.000 --> 08:28.000]  But that's what they would do
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  And you've all heard that and you've seen that
[08:30.000 --> 08:32.000]  But then you could go read the book or see the article
[08:32.000 --> 08:35.000]  Or go to the library and find the official U.N. documents
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  And Club of Rome documents that were saying all of this
[08:38.000 --> 08:41.000]  And then Bilderberg group documents that insiders
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  And others would leak out
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  And that we would then expose
[08:48.000 --> 08:50.000]  But to learn this type of information
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  We used to have to hide out inside the hotel
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  Till they already got there
[08:56.000 --> 09:01.000]  Try to get any of their literature
[09:01.000 --> 09:04.000]  Insiders later would be so outraged by what they heard
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  By insiders, people that worked in the hotels
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  A lot of times they'd contact us later
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  And give us different documents
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  As they were able to abscond with
[09:15.000 --> 09:22.000]  But now, you know, you really don't need to
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  Climb over fences and hide in hotels
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  To catch the world leaders pushing world government
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  Now you just turn on the television
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  Or you go to Twitter at the top of it
[09:33.000 --> 09:35.000]  They're promoting it like it's the best thing
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  Since Mother's Milk
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  Here's some of the headlines
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  Bob tells global leaders to collaborate
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  For world governance, okay?
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  Top economists were about to abandon
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  The traditional system of money
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And replace it with digital blockchain
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  And we're going to program it and drill every asset
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  In your life and every aspect of your life
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  And then we've got more articles about different states
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.000]  Trying to pass bills to keep babies alive
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  And then kill them whenever the government wants to
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Or let parents kill their children after birth
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  And it's just all right here, just hell upon the planet
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  The collapse and death of the country
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  And then you've got the Washington Post
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  And the New York Times articles that came out
[10:18.000 --> 10:20.000]  A couple of days ago that we barely mentioned
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  And I've since talked to some of the people
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  That were actually subpoenaed there
[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  No one knows who was subpoenaed yet in full
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  I do
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  We have like a lot of huge big breaking news here
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  And what they're doing and what they're saying
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  And the feds are saying
[10:36.000 --> 10:39.000]  That protesting and speech is now illegal
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  And they have had a bunch of prosecutors
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  Get off the cases or resign
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  Some of that's already come out
[10:45.000 --> 10:47.000]  Saying these people are innocent
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  And so Merrick Garland has actually put
[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  Special Deputy Attorney General in there
[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  With the job of outlawing the Republican Party
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.000]  Sometime before the midterms
[10:56.000 --> 10:58.000]  In 221 days
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  This is directly out of the Justice Department
[11:01.000 --> 11:04.000]  The FBI, the people subpoenaed all of it
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.000]  I barely got on there today because I've been on the phone
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  For hours going over all this
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  And why?
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  Because they want yours truly
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  To get on an airplane
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  And go into Mordor and march into the Justice Department
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  And talk to them
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  So
[11:22.000 --> 11:24.000]  That's just icing on the cake for how screwed
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  This country and the world is
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  And these power mad people
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Are just going to destroy the country
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Because it's a mixture of incompetence
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  And arrogance and decadence
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  And living in their own weird little leftist bubbles
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  And following bizarre orders
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  That this country, I mean
[11:44.000 --> 11:46.000]  Can you imagine trying to make that dog
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  Hunt
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  Of outlawing the Republican Party essentially?
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  That's why they've come out
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Against Clarence Thomas' wife
[11:54.000 --> 11:56.000]  And are calling for her arrest in the news
[11:56.000 --> 11:58.000]  Because she said, is there anything true
[11:58.000 --> 12:00.000]  To watermarks on ballots
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  Because if so, and this is proven to be
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Fraud, this would overturn the election
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  That's just her asking a question
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  Of course, I'm in all those stories
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  Because I said I didn't think the watermark story was true
[12:14.000 --> 12:16.000]  Oh, the story's even too crazy for Jones
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  And all she did, they had her text messages
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  Was asked, is this true
[12:22.000 --> 12:24.000]  To Mark Meadows, what's wrong with that?
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  She could have said, I want to overturn the election
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  That's all right
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  And the Democrats said
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  Even when Trump wins, we will not abide by it
[12:32.000 --> 12:34.000]  And we'll have a civil war if we need to
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  And we will
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  To the New York Times
[12:38.000 --> 12:40.000]  About conference meeting with Hillary
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  And Obama and Biden
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  And John Podesta
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  And they're in the meeting, I read the story over and over again
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Right before the election
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  And they said, we will have our own electors
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  And we will have our own inauguration
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  And the military will throw Trump out
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  So they were talking about martial law
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  They were talking about using the military
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  They were talking about
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  All this stuff they were going to do
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  And that helped raise the temperature
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  Of the whole background noise that's going on
[13:06.000 --> 13:08.000]  Then they had the police stand down
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  They refused the National Guard
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Trump wanted, he could have over read them
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  But his chairman of the Joint Chiefs threatened to quit
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  If he did and said, we can't have the military in America
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  And you saw what happened
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  When a million people came to DC
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  Trump thought about 50,000 economy
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  He's been quoted by insiders
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And I was like, now I think about a million going to show up
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  You better have a lot of security
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  We want to show the power of the American people
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  In a peaceful protest that was
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Even bigger than what Martin Luther King did
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  And of course, my prediction came true
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  But the point is the Democrats ordered that stand down
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And that's what the Republicans say
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  If they retake the House and Senate
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  They're going to have committee hearings on
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Well
[13:50.000 --> 13:52.000]  The Democratic Party
[13:52.000 --> 13:54.000]  Does not intend
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  To ever let the country get to that
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  Point where they are thrown
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  Out of office
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  So I'm going to be getting more into that
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  Today as well because while we're looking
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  At Russia and while we're looking at collapse
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Of the food and supply industry
[14:14.000 --> 14:16.000]  And exploding energy prices
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  That's all front and center, front burner
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  Is number one important for the world
[14:20.000 --> 14:22.000]  And for America
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  But the backdrop
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  Of the crazy leftist
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  SJWs at the Justice Department
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  Who've pushed the FBI out of the way
[14:30.000 --> 14:32.000]  And are themselves running
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  Their January 6th obsession
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  Trying to make connections that don't exist
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  To then have
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  Their big election event
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  Their big
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  Surprise
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.000]  To make themselves look good
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  Against the food prices and energy prices
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  And open borders and collapsing cities
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  That the Republicans plan to
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  Overthrow an election
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  And that the Republicans plan to attack the Capitol
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  And that wasn't the case
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  How do you run on that?
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  I'll tell you how you run on that
[15:08.000 --> 15:10.000]  Because they're getting ready to steal the next election
[15:10.000 --> 15:12.000]  And they want a big purple walk
[15:12.000 --> 15:14.000]  Going to people that question the election
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  So that it's outlawed this country
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  And the Republican Party
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  By election fraud
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Outlawing the Republican Party
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  The Republican Party is over
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  It became populist, it became popular
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  There was a landslide, a political realignment
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  The Republican Party should split in two
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  The Democratic Party is discredited and old
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  It was discredited during the Civil War
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  But it never went away, it's always been a cancer
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  Since the Civil War
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  But it's not going away
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  We're going away, America's going away
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  And the Republican Party
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  Is broken and we have a Stigial Group
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  And we'll be like Venezuela for the leftist
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  One Party State forever
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  The end of the Republic is here
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  Oh, they're going to stage terror attacks and blame us
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  In December of 2021
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  Info Wars offered the first
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  In a three-part series
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  And it sold out in 10 days
[16:10.000 --> 16:12.000]  And if it wasn't for listeners
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  Getting this original
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Powerful coin, a founding member coin
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  We would not be on air today
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Now the second coin
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  The Liberty Tree Coin
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  Is being offered
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  And it will probably sell out in 10 days
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  Again, it certainly needs to
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  To fund our operation
[16:30.000 --> 16:32.000]  It is so historic
[16:32.000 --> 16:34.000]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  See the coin for yourself
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  At 1776coin.com
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  It's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  And as a founding member
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  If we're able to stay on the air
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  We're planning something very, very special
[16:52.000 --> 16:54.000]  For everyone that helps us go to the next level
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  While you still can
[16:58.000 --> 17:18.000]  Visit 1776coin.com
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  To be able to post their content
[17:30.000 --> 17:32.000]  Free of charge
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And because it's become so successful
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  It's a catch-22
[17:36.000 --> 17:38.000]  Info Wars and Bandai Video
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  Have become a mothership
[17:40.000 --> 17:42.000]  Promoting the pro-human Liberty movement worldwide
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  But the expenses
[17:44.000 --> 17:46.000]  In bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter
[17:46.000 --> 17:48.000]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  So the biggest sale in Info Wars history
[17:50.000 --> 17:52.000]  Is going right now
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  The mega-emergence low-out sale
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  Up to 75% off
[17:56.000 --> 17:58.000]  Getting credible products
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  And keep Info Wars as strong as ever
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  Were very public about their plans
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  They financed major universities
[18:06.000 --> 18:08.000]  They ran full-page stories
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  And advertisements pushing their propaganda
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  Of the New York Times, other major newspapers
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  That the family as we know it
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.000]  Is a bad thing
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  And must be ended
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  And the first step in that
[18:20.000 --> 18:22.000]  Is getting women out of the household
[18:22.000 --> 18:24.000]  Teaching women that cooking dinner
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  Sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  And I was just sitting here tonight
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  Making dinner for my daughter
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.000]  My four-national daughter
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  But I like to make it as well
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  I love to make breakfast
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[18:40.000 --> 18:42.000]  To make food for your family
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  And be nurturative
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  And then all sit down together
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  And have that communal event
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  Is our normal biological actions
[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  Like evil scientific cult of filth
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  That want to domesticate us
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  And turn us into lab rats
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  We cannot let this continue
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  Anything of real quality
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Anything of lasting durability
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  Anything that's really satisfying
[19:06.000 --> 19:08.000]  Empowering and fulfilling
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  Is gonna be hard to attain
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  And when it comes to information
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  Boy, is that true today
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  We see the entire global corrupt
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Anti-human depopulation
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Great reset combine
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  Trying to collapse our society
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.000]  To build on its ashes
[19:24.000 --> 19:26.000]  Their transhumanist nightmare vision
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  Suppressing the voices
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  Of good people all around the world
[19:30.000 --> 19:32.000]  And of doctors and scientists
[19:32.000 --> 19:34.000]  And engineers
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  That are exposing all their lies
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  Their COVID hysteria
[19:38.000 --> 19:40.000]  Their world's gonna end in 2030
[19:40.000 --> 19:42.000]  Carbon tax, global warming bull
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  All of it
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  And none of it can succeed
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  None of it can actually be carried out
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  In the midst of gas lit
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  That's why truth comes
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  With hard work and with research and with diligence
[19:54.000 --> 19:56.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  Full Wars links and band up video links
[19:58.000 --> 20:26.000]  Not to share them now more than ever
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  This is it
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  In the year 2022
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Forces of Satan
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Openly announced world government
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  The accelerated collapse of all major
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  World currencies
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  And the announcement of a new one world government
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  Programmable currency
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  That tracks, traces and controls everything
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  You can do and what you're even allowed
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  To spend on it
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  That is where we are
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  In the year
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  2022
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  You have lived to see world government
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  Openly announced
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  And it's aim of impoverishing you
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  And finally
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Slowly killing you
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  Many will decide to serve it
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  For short term gain
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  But in the end
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  Discredit their family name
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  And separate themselves from god
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  I want to hit some of that big world
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  Government news here
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  I want to hit some of that big world government news
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  And get to some of the clubs and give the number out
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  And take a lot of phone calls today
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  But first
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  We have to keep moving forward as if there's a chance
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  To turn this around and at least
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  Have a softer crash landing
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  And there is some good examples of that
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Who did it but somebody in the by-demonstration
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  Said hey
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  You just cut off
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  A third of the world's fertilizer supply
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  And about half of where we get our fertilizer
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  Russia
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  And the same petrochemicals
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  That are mined out of these
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  Deposits
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  We're not going to be able to make
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  Explosives without it
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  So the Pentagon
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  I know is involved
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  But they don't say exactly who in the government
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  Had this good idea
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  To not cut the fertilizer off
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  As much as it's been cut off
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  There are some little
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  Specs of sanity maybe
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  Somewhere going on
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  And if we expose this
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  There's a very good chance we can turn it back
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  So I don't want to just tell you the scary stuff
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  And not let you know there's solutions out there
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  In my view
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  There's a lot of examples of this
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  But we were really harping on it two years ago
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  That the ongoing lockdowns would trigger a supply chain
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  Right now and it would kill
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  Billions of people if the collapse became
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  Permanent
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  Long term
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  And deep
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  But if they cut it back
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  Or stopped it fast
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  It would only kill 50, 60, 100 million people
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  We went and looked at the numbers
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  And the last numbers we got was only a year in
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  They never gave new numbers
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  But 40 plus million died
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  The U.N. then estimated 280 something million
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  Were on the verge of starvation
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.000]  Now they say 272
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  Million
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  As of yesterday in their actuaries
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  Will starve to death
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  On current trends
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  In the next two years
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  Now normally 15 million people starve to death a year
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  That's the average in the last 50 years
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  Look it up folks, I might just put numbers out here
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  You can look all this up
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  If the
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  Lockdowns are brought back
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  Or if the cut off of the petrochemicals
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  And the fertilizers continues
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  I think that's a very accurate number from the U.N.
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  Of 270
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  Plus
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  272 or 273
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  So that's not on the verge of starvation
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  Like they said two years ago
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  That's
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  Going to starve to death
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  Going
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  Going to starve to death
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  There's different ways to look at it too
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  You can say 10 million die a year
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Or 20 million die a year
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  Because usually they end up dying of a cold or a flu
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Because they're so malnourished
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  To split those numbers
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  But if you really care about human life
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  And you don't want to see how much people die
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  You've got to be concerned about this
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  And you've got to be talking about this
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  And you've got to be aware of this
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  U.N. warrants Middle East at breaking point
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  As food prices hit alarming highs
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  A lot of people say well why don't we care
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  Well I've been harping on this
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  For two years, Vladimir Putin's now come out
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  And warrants
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  West
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  Food crisis
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  Lead to new migrant crisis
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  Out of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  And Asia, which is totally true
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  And the worst off is Africa
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  And the Middle East, and the Middle East
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  Borders Europe
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  Western Europe
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  Central Europe
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  Eastern Europe
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  And so that's absolutely true
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  When the third world collapses
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  They flood into the first world
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  Vladimir Putin has warned the west that Europe
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Has another influx of migrants
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  Caused by global food crisis
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  That is now inevitable
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  The Russian president made the comments at a meeting
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  On air transport aircraft manufacturing
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Yesterday
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  Putin's invasion of Ukraine
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  Prompted western sanctions
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  And an energy squeeze that has left the stability
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  Of the global food supply and precarious state
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  And it's not, well that
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  It was precarious before because of the lockdowns
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  Now it's collapsing
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Soaring international food inflation
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  Letting our nations to warn that the Middle East
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  Is near a breaking point with food
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Riots a real possibility
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  We're not a possibility there, are we starting?
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Meanwhile, he
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  Followed through on it today, he cut the gas supply
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  To Europe
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  Because they were not buying it in rubles
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  And what's Biden up to
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  He's riding around this Corvette
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  Acting cool with Jay Leno
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  And the media goes, isn't he cool?
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  Look at his sunglasses, aviators
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  Wow
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  Well, I like Jay Leno, he's a good guy
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  But I mean, you know
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  Here he is riding around with his sunglasses
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  Acting cool with Jay Leno
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  In a classic gasoline driven car
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Let them eat cake, let them drive
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  Electric cars
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  In fact, let's just play that short
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  Jay Leno
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Biden clip for folks
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  For radio listeners, here it is
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  I've always loved to drive
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  I shouldn't have to say it on time
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  I like speed
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  You guys are pushing electric vehicles today
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  This is a president who always talks about
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  The power of our example
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Does he own an electric vehicle?
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Presidents of the United States don't do a lot of driving
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  He posted videos where he's revving
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  The engine of his Corvette in Wellington
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  He owns cars
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And he also has driven electric vehicles as president
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  To give a model to the rest of the country
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Let's go
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  So, I'm going to play a few of these clips
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  When we come back
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Of world government being announced
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  Of Klaus Schwab licking his lips
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  It's going to be so hard now
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  There will be no more energy now
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  But it is okay, a new future is being born
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  Yeah, a future where we're totally poor
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  If we're lucky, dead if we're not
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  That's all coming up
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Next segment
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  But we need to sell
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  All 10,000 of these very, very quickly
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  And I appreciate listeners
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Getting over half of them now
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  I'd like to move them out very quickly
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  And without the last coin sale
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  We would not be operating
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  At the same capacity
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  And that's a big problem
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  So I want to thank folks that got part one

[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  And tyrants, it's a coin I designed

[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And it will end up being a collectible
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  I know that the first coin is already
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Selling on eBay and other places
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  For three times what we sold it
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  So it's a limited edition collectible

[31:02.000 --> 31:04.000]  It's just true
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  I'm seen by the globalist
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  As the standard of human liberty
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  As the logo
[31:10.000 --> 31:12.000]  Of human populace resistance

[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  The most important aspects
[31:22.000 --> 31:24.000]  Of what we've ever done
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  So I'm asking listeners now
[31:26.000 --> 31:28.000]  To realize we've got great products
[31:28.000 --> 31:30.000]  Thousands of them at info wars 4.com
[31:30.000 --> 31:32.000]  And we are funded by
[31:32.000 --> 31:34.000]  Readers and viewers like you
[31:34.000 --> 31:36.000]  And so now we need to support more than ever
[31:36.000 --> 31:38.000]  Because this fight has intensified
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  Don't need me to tell you that
[31:40.000 --> 31:42.000]  At info wars 4.com
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  We've got 25 to 75% off
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  Across the board right now
[31:46.000 --> 31:48.000]  Things have been sold out for a long time
[31:48.000 --> 31:50.000]  Like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  That's so amazing
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  And our new immune support formula
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.000]  That's so critical
[31:56.000 --> 31:58.000]  They're all available 25 to 75% off
[31:58.000 --> 32:02.000]  4store.com right now
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  Athletic performance, blood vessels, and more
[32:59.000 --> 33:02.000]  Leading a frontal assault
[33:02.000 --> 33:04.000]  On the lies of the New World Order
[33:04.000 --> 33:06.000]  It's Alex Jones
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  Alex Jones
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  So it may have been done
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  But I haven't found it yet
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  Maybe we should do it here at info wars
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  But I've probably watched
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  I don't want to exaggerate
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  More than 100 clips
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  The last three days of the World Government Summit
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  That's what it's called
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  Sponsored by the Royal Family
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  And the World Economic Forum
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  Headed up by Klaus Schwab in Dubai
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  And I mean I've seen at least 30 clips
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  Of them announcing world government
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  Cashless societies
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  New World Order
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  End of the family
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  End of single family dwellings
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  Taking your cars away
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  Well they all pull up in
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  $200,000 G-wagons and stuff
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  I mean it's just
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  In land and $60 million jets
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  It's just totally insane
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  And they have platinum toilets
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  It's being reported
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  Because the attendees are so into money
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  They like show pictures of them
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  They're using the bathroom in platinum toilets
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  And landing
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  In 50, 60, 70 million dollar jets
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  And you
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  Can't
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  Have a job
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  You are going to own
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  Nothing and have nothing and like it
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  So here's just a few of the clips
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  That came out this morning
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  Of the World Government Summit
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  You can see it there on screen
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  They've got it in
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  All the letters
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  World Government Summit
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  Bigger than Dallas
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  And the whole thing
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  Is about how
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  They are going to take over the world
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  With JPMorgan Goldman Sachs
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  BlackRock and Vanguard
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  And how within 4 years
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  They will own 95% of everything
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  They already own 80%
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  And they're just declaring war on you
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Declaring you're going to have nothing
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  Declaring you're going to own nothing
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  But it's a global digital currency
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  That will still look like American
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  Look like UK, look like
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  Chinese, look like South African
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  Look like pesos
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  In Mexico
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  But it's a global digital one platform
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  And it will still have the logo
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Of the country you're in
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  But it will be programmable tokens
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  That tell you what you're allowed to buy
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  And what you're allowed to do
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  So there's no escaping the total surveillance
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  And abuse
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Swab
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  Telling you about how you're not going to have any resources
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  And how sad it is, but don't worry
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  You'll love it
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  And then here is one of the top
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  World Bank economists
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  We're about to abandon traditional system
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Of money and there's another one of them
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  Talking about their new world order
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  At the World Government Summit
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  Here it is
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  We do not yet know the full extent
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  And the systemic
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  And structural changes which will happen
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  However
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  We do know
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  That global energy systems
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  Food systems and supply chains
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Will be deeply affected
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  What underpins a world order
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  Is always the financial system
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  I was very privileged
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  My father was an advisor to Nixon
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  When they came off the gold standard
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  In 71 and so
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  I was brought up with a kind of inside view
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  Of how very important
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  The financial structure
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  Is to absolutely everything else
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  And what we're seeing in the world today
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  I think is we are in the brink of a dramatic change
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  Where we are about to
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  And I'll say this boldly
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  We're about to abandon the traditional system
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  Of money and accounting
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  And introduce a new one
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  And the new one, the new accounting
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  Is what we call blockchain
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  It means digital
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  It means having a almost perfect record
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  Of every single transaction
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  That happens in the economy
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  Which will give us far greater clarity
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  Over what's going on
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  It also raises huge dangers
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  In terms of the balance of power
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  Between states and citizens
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  In my opinion we're going to need
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  A digital constitution of human rights
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  If we're going to have digital money
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  But also
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  This new money will be
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  Sovereign in nature
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  Most people think that digital money
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  Is crypto and private
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  But what I see are superpowers
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  Introducing digital
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Currency, the Chinese were the first
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  The US is on the brink
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  I think of moving in the same direction
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  The Europeans have committed to that as well
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  And the question is
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  Will that new system of digital money
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  And digital accounting
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  Accommodate the competing needs
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  Of the citizens of all these locations
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  So that every human being
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  Has a chance to have a better life
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Because that's the only measure
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  Of whether a world order
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  Really serves
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  And the title of this session
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  Are we ready
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  For a new
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  World order
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  Oh, but you hear them
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  You hear them saying
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  Oh, but we need a bill of rights
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  A digital bill of rights
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  A global standardised system
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  To make sure nobody abuses you
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  With this system, when out of the gates
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  It's a social credit score
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  Designed by the globalist
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  Rolled out in communist China
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  And now being rolled out against us
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  With debanking and harassment
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  And the left calling for basically anybody
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  That doesn't submit to them
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  To absolutely be
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  Dehumanised
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  And destroyed
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  So that's why I've said
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  We should learn about these digital currencies
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  And we should support independent ones
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  And have hundreds of them
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  Not
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  In regional ones that are all basically
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  In one database controlled by one system
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  That's the enemy
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  And the whole future is going to be
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  Gold and silver
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  And other types of cryptocurrencies
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  And barter
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  And that's why with the internet of things
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  They're saying everything's going to be surveilled
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  And controlled to make sure you're not outside
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  Of this AI economy
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  Because they're going to promise that
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  The AI will give you all prosperity
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  And give you all your social credit score
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  And give you all your guaranteed basic income
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  But people
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  Not going along with the world system
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  It's our fault things are collapsing
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  It's our fault there's not enough food
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  It's our fault there won't be enough water
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  When the whole global assistance
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  About cutting off the resources
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  To bring in the system
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  To get full control of us
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  And then use the dwindling resources
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  That have been artificially created
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  Their artificial scarcity for absolute
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  Total social control
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  So with one hand they take everything away from you
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  And then say submit to me more
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  Put on more chains give us more control
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  And it'll get better
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  And what does the average
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  Vapid confused
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  Shallow leftist do
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  Who isn't really informed
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  Who's very mentally lazy
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  They go yeah
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  It's the people that didn't go along with this
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  It's the Amish
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  It's the people
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  They've got all these white papers and books
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  And programs and plantopolis shows
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  They show kids in the UK
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  Financed by the UN
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  The Rockefeller Foundation
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Going back 12 years ago
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Things would sure work better
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  If there wasn't that ghetto
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  Of people that refused to be in the digital system
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  Under the UN World Food Council
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  With their smart phone telling them
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  Where they can go and what they can do
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  You only get meat once a year on your birthday
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  And things would work better
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  For
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  My cousin that lives in the ghetto
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  We need to go ahead and just outlaw people
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  Not taking their chip
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  This is an exact
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  Nightmare plan
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  And remember
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  Simultaneously the Atlantic Monthly
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  And the New York Times and the Financial Times
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  The London Guardian say
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  There is no plan for a world government
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  There is no plan for a global social credit score
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  There is no plan for forced inoculation
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  There is no big banks running it
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  And anybody that says it
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  Needs to be arrested
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  Chiefly Alex Jones
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  There are headlines in the New York Times
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  Alex Jones
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  Creates
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  World Government
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  Conspiracy Theory
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  From just 5 years ago
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Look it up, Alex Jones
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  World Government
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  Click News, Click New York Times
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  You'll see articles and it says
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  Insane
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  It doesn't exist
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  I'm going to give the number
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  Out next segment, we're going to start going to your phone calls
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  I've got a bunch of other clips and news to get to here
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  But that is gaslighting
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  Where they do all this
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  They set it all up, we know what's coming next
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  We warn you, we show you
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  Where they're saying it in white papers
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  How they plan to go operational a certain date
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  We warn you for decades, it goes operational
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  And they're still simultaneously
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  Demonizing and attacking
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  And censoring anybody
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  That exposes it
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  Because that's the agenda
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  But everybody should go whoa
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  You can't talk about World Government
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  But it's being set up by James Bond villain
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Who says I'm going to not own anything or have anything
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  And Obama goes to Africa and says
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  Sorry, we need to take your cars and air conditioners away
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  I mean this is dystopia
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  These are the bad guys
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  Now together
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  We are only offering three coins
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  In the series
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  The first coin was released in December
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  Of 2021 and sold out in 10 days
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  Now the second coin
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  As we enter the last days of March
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  Into April, 2022
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  Is now being offered
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days

[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  And because our amazing listeners

[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  That we're set to launch
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  In the very near future
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  Thanks to your support of this project

[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  A real piece of history at 1776coin.com
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  The globalists are bombarding us
[44:02.000 --> 44:05.000]  With propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  And with poisons and chemicals added to the food
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  It's all come out
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  But because we're made the image of God
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  The creator and we are powerful
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  That nobody knows who first came up with
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  The boy is it true
[44:25.000 --> 44:29.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  If the situation was hopeless
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  They need all their propaganda
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  And all their lies and all their evil
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  And all their cultural death
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  Because they know we are strong
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  And they know in the end they signed on
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  The God of this world who is a loser
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  Keep info wars on the air now more than ever
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  What the globalists are manifesting
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  And setting up is satanic
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  And we are opposing the one world government
[44:57.000 --> 44:59.000]  And the mark of the beast they just announced
[44:59.000 --> 45:02.000]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  Is still unaware that there's a war
[45:04.000 --> 45:07.000]  Between free individuals and nation states
[45:07.000 --> 45:10.000]  On one side and the globalist on the other
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.000]  Who are literally trying to create a post-human world
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  From the United States to Brazil
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  And of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  Nations were pulling out of the private
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  Corporate fascist world government
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  That's why they launched their great recess
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  And their program after collapsing us
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  Of build back better
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  This is nothing more than a top down
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  Vertical consolidation of the world economy
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  And because they couldn't take our guns
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  And because we wouldn't bow
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  Because the left which is the ideology
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  Of this world government system couldn't win
[45:42.000 --> 45:45.000]  They released a biological weapon on us
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  Now we know two years ago
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  We learned about it about 20 months ago
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.000]  It's that simple
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  They can't meet us because of our free speech
[45:52.000 --> 45:53.000]  And our guns
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[45:56.000 --> 45:57.000]  And you know the rest is history
[45:57.000 --> 46:26.000]  Exposed at Faradayn and we win
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  And everyone out there that wants to be healthy

[47:27.000 --> 47:51.000]  At infowarstore.com
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  Man, Bob Marley's son
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  He knows what he's talking about, doesn't he?
[47:56.000 --> 48:03.000]  The Corribean's falling apart because of COVID
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  And that Jamaica is in horrible shape
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.000]  Because of COVID, no
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  It's because of two years of lock down
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  That destroyed the economy's there
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  It was your lockdown, did it?
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  Not, COVID, you lying monster
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  And again, ladies and gentlemen
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Her ancestors were colonists
[48:23.000 --> 48:30.640]  Her ancestors were colonists that came and had black slaves in Jamaica and she's bragged about that
[48:30.800 --> 48:34.280]  She's not black. She's a Brahmin Indian and
[48:34.920 --> 48:36.560]  Those are great people
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.840]  but they got their own caste system and own slaves and stuff around the world and
[48:42.040 --> 48:47.960]  That was wrong and I just it just it's disgusting about everything about her as a fraud ladies and gentlemen
[48:47.960 --> 48:49.960]  I
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  Mean it's like
[48:53.960 --> 48:55.960]  That US senator
[48:56.280 --> 48:58.280]  What's her name Pocahontas?
[48:58.920 --> 49:00.920]  saying she's a Native American
[49:01.240 --> 49:04.480]  And they did her blood test and she had zero
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.760]  What what's the name of the US senator Elizabeth Warren, that's right
[49:11.200 --> 49:13.200]  Elizabeth Warren
[49:13.200 --> 49:21.440]  In fact even geneticists said that it's almost unheard of to have anyone unless their family just got off the boat here from Europe
[49:21.720 --> 49:23.720]  To have zero Native American
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.760]  Like basically anybody whose family's been here for a couple hundred years as part Native American
[49:28.760 --> 49:31.400]  I've got it on multiple sides of the family a little bit here a little bit there
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.600]  But the point is is that she had basically zero. She's just complete liar
[49:37.520 --> 49:40.040]  No Native American genetics
[49:40.040 --> 49:46.360]  But I'm digressing I mean these people are just such incredible frauds
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.440]  But hey, you can be transgender
[49:49.920 --> 49:55.840]  Can also be transracial. How many of these black lives matter leaders we later learned had
[49:56.600 --> 49:58.600]  blonde hair and blue eyes
[49:58.600 --> 50:02.120]  dye their hair black tan their skin brown and then wear
[50:03.120 --> 50:05.120]  brown contacts
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.160]  It's called being a fraud
[50:07.160 --> 50:09.160]  It's called being an opposer
[50:11.880 --> 50:18.640]  And I'm not knocking people that want to look a certain way or whatever. I'm just saying when you go out and then pretend you're that
[50:19.760 --> 50:24.120]  It's a fraud, but it's the left that does that and then says if I wear a
[50:29.200 --> 50:32.080]  Native American outfit for Halloween that I'm culturally
[50:33.200 --> 50:35.200]  Stealing something from someone
[50:35.200 --> 50:42.720]  I'm digressing boy. You talk about that. I've got some clips here Maxine Waters told a confused group of homeless people to go home
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.720]  And they say we're homeless
[50:45.480 --> 50:47.480]  We need government shelter
[50:48.160 --> 50:54.640]  And this is actually a people that recently some of them got interviewed after been kicked out of their homes and lost their apartments
[50:54.800 --> 50:56.800]  So this was not your normal
[50:57.080 --> 50:59.080]  crackhead or
[50:59.080 --> 51:05.320]  Fitting old zombies that are out there running around all over California. It's scary. Hell. They're here in Austin, too
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.320]  But these are folks that actually want help and then they're like listen, we're homeless
[51:10.880 --> 51:12.560]  She's like go home
[51:12.560 --> 51:14.560]  We don't have a home
[51:15.320 --> 51:17.320]  We need help
[51:19.360 --> 51:22.880]  She's got like what three houses in California alone was like 10 million bucks
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.960]  Never had any other job outside of that though. The boys. She's got a lot of money
[51:29.680 --> 51:34.440]  Even though it's dozens of times what her congressional salary could pay. It's like Nancy Pelosi
[51:36.040 --> 51:38.160]  I mean, I've just got stacks of articles like this
[51:38.160 --> 51:42.600]  There's so much here, but but I wanted to get to this clip because this is a non-binary teacher
[51:42.600 --> 51:44.600]  It looks like a woman that thinks he's a man
[51:45.840 --> 51:47.840]  This is a non-binary teacher is
[51:47.840 --> 51:51.840]  responsible for two-year-olds at a daycare and
[51:53.320 --> 51:59.920]  It says that it makes it angry when people don't want to talk about gender and sexuality in classrooms
[51:59.920 --> 52:02.680]  And it's like this other guy who's a school teacher for
[52:03.320 --> 52:08.980]  Third-grade students in Florida and he said under this law. I can't tell them about my love life
[52:09.680 --> 52:14.720]  What are you doing telling people about your love life? I mean again, I'm gonna say this again
[52:14.720 --> 52:16.720]  if
[52:18.520 --> 52:23.960]  You were married and a lot of you're married you a lot of you have children imagine if you came home at night
[52:23.960 --> 52:28.880]  I was just thinking about this game this morning and your wife sitting on the couch with your
[52:29.480 --> 52:31.480]  five-year-old son or daughter
[52:31.880 --> 52:37.400]  Teaching them how to shove sex toys in their rear end. You would say have you had a stroke?
[52:37.400 --> 52:41.160]  Are you mentally ill stop that and you would get a divorce?
[52:41.160 --> 52:44.160]  One time I
[52:46.080 --> 52:47.920]  Mean how does it even come into a parent's head?
[52:47.920 --> 52:50.720]  So how is it perfect strangers because all over the country?
[52:50.720 --> 52:57.680]  They're teaching third fourth and fifth graders about sex toys and how to shove things on their rear ends and how to masturbate
[52:59.640 --> 53:03.320]  And I'm sorry to talk like that on the show, but this is going on here, okay
[53:03.320 --> 53:08.120]  I mean, I didn't even get to it earlier in the week has made me too mad the curriculum in
[53:08.120 --> 53:12.160]  California and in Texas for that matter in Austin and in
[53:13.480 --> 53:16.480]  It was in Colorado and it was literally
[53:17.080 --> 53:22.080]  Have your international queer day and teach them about different types of sex and
[53:22.440 --> 53:29.600]  Transgenderism have the come out of the closet party for them and then have them paint their nails and hair the boys and girls and then come out
[53:29.720 --> 53:33.200]  Practice coming out as different groups and how to use sex toys
[53:33.200 --> 53:39.720]  And then when the parents or others get angry how to use that to have the class come together and refuse to be oppressed
[53:41.400 --> 53:45.320]  literal cult brainwashing and to be bad enough if say the
[53:46.600 --> 53:52.400]  Mexican mafia came to your school and tried to induct kids into the Mexican mafia or if the Aryan Nations came and said
[53:52.400 --> 53:57.400]  We're gonna induct you into a racial gang or something, but at least that's not trying to have sex with them
[53:57.400 --> 54:03.360]  People would freak out, but when a sex cult shows up with a bunch of freaks dressed like clowns
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.400]  And they want to have a conversation with your five-year-old with your six-year-old and
[54:12.800 --> 54:18.560]  Camps for ten-year-old girls with biological males sleeping in the small cabins with them
[54:19.480 --> 54:23.800]  In California and when the parents complained they're the bad ones
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.960]  I mean they are screwing up tiny children as young as two
[54:30.640 --> 54:33.960]  Beyond destroying your innocence, I mean
[54:37.560 --> 54:39.560]  Imagine again you're at a part and
[54:45.640 --> 54:51.520]  Somebody just walks up man or woman and say I'd like to have a conversation with your seven-year-old about sex you start calling the police
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.600]  But when it's done in an institution a school the institution stands up and then you feel intimidated
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.880]  And that's how they took the Catholic Church over it's how they took over all these groups and they're doing it right now
[55:02.880 --> 55:05.960]  They already destroyed the Boy Scouts folks and they're taking over everything
[55:05.960 --> 55:09.880]  We have to stand up and say no to this here's a clip of this creature
[55:10.560 --> 55:15.080]  Literally like they go to the city council said the same thing I need that access to your children
[55:15.080 --> 55:18.920]  I need to teach them not to be hateful. I need to teach them their 57 genders
[55:18.920 --> 55:20.920]  Here it is
[55:23.080 --> 55:25.080]  Makes me very angry when
[55:25.600 --> 55:29.360]  People don't want to talk about gender and sexuality in classrooms
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.320]  Specifically for the reason that students won't understand
[55:35.320 --> 55:40.160]  Because in my experience with teaching that is never the case
[55:40.680 --> 55:44.000]  I'm a non-binary teacher and I use the title mix
[55:44.000 --> 55:51.320]  And today I had 12 new students and I just go. Hi. My name is mix for VQ
[55:51.320 --> 55:56.600]  I use mix instead of miss. It's a little bit different, but I'm still a teacher just the same and
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.360]  They got it right away
[56:01.360 --> 56:03.360]  Instead of miss all day
[56:04.200 --> 56:08.360]  And it makes it it confuses me when people use that
[56:09.200 --> 56:12.080]  excuse that children won't understand because
[56:12.080 --> 56:16.040]  Students are very intelligent and they're learning all day
[56:16.400 --> 56:22.440]  It's not hard for them to learn a different type of title. This whacked out zombie teaches two to four-year-olds
[56:22.440 --> 56:24.120]  It says on her own Instagram
[56:24.120 --> 56:30.640]  So there you go. We're gonna go to break the toll-free number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight

[1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:15.320]  Don't bother
[1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:26.320]  They're here

[1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:57.320]  There ought to be clowns
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:01:03.320]  Your phone calls are coming up next segment special guesting studio so much news to break
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:07.320]  I'm also going to comment next segment on the big coverage of
[1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:14.320]  Callthorn coming out and talking about being invited to orgies and the Republicans freaking out about it
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:18.320]  And then now the media is spinning it like I'm saying Republicans are involved in orgies
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:22.320]  No, a lot of those rich corrupt elites are not just Republicans
[1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:28.320]  We were just saying that the Republican was telling the truth about it being invited to that from the information we have
[1:01:28.320 --> 1:01:31.320]  I'll talk more about that next segment, but I want to play back to back some clips
[1:01:31.320 --> 1:01:39.320]  Here's Fauci a decade ago on national television saying the best vaccination is to get the infection yourself
[1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:44.320]  But for the last two years if you said that even if you're a medical doctor on big tech platforms
[1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  You'd be banned
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:51.320]  Talk about criminal and then that ties in with insurance companies preparing to deny life insurance claims
[1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:54.320]  To those killed by the vaccines, there's a clip on that
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:02:00.320]  And another clip of the prime minister of New Zealand with her bizarre statements
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:02.320]  Here are these clips back to back
[1:02:02.320 --> 1:02:05.320]  But she said the flu for 14 days, should she get a flu shot?
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:09.320]  Well, no, if she got the flu for 14 days, she's as protected as anybody can be
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:13.320]  Because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself
[1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:21.320]  And if she really has the flu, if she really has the flu, she definitely doesn't need a flu vaccine
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  If she really has the flu
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:25.320]  She should not get it again
[1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:30.320]  Because it's the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself
[1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:37.320]  So in France, there was an elderly wealthy businessman who got out life insurance for millions of dollars
[1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:39.320]  He got the COVID vaccine and he died
[1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:43.320]  So the life insurance company is not paying out
[1:02:43.320 --> 1:02:49.320]  Because they decided that the COVID vaccine is a medical experiment
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:55.320]  And death from a medical experiment is not a covered entity
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:03:04.320]  Furthermore, even the judge says that the side effects from the vaccine are well known
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:06.320]  They've been made public
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:11.320]  There's absolutely no way that this gentleman could not have known the side effects
[1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.320]  He willingly chose to get the vaccine
[1:03:15.320 --> 1:03:21.320]  And he died as a result and because it was a choice, they're calling it a suicide
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:26.320]  Can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things?
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:34.320]  And suicides along with death from experimental drugs are not covered in life insurance
[1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:35.320]  So I know what you're thinking
[1:03:35.320 --> 1:03:39.320]  Oh, that happened in France, that would never happen in the US
[1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:46.320]  Well, I'm sorry to tell you, but the American Life Insurance Council has also said
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:55.320]  That life insurance policies may deny payment if you die from the COVID-19 vaccine
[1:03:55.320 --> 1:04:00.320]  Because they are experimental drugs
[1:04:00.320 --> 1:04:01.320]  There you go
[1:04:01.320 --> 1:04:03.320]  This is something we thought might happen
[1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.320]  We're seeing it happen
[1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:10.320]  You might want to check your policy
[1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.320]  The so-called leadership of this protest
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:18.320]  Do you think that emboldens the protesters and do you think it's a responsible thing to do?
[1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:20.320]  No, I don't think it was a responsible thing to do
[1:04:20.320 --> 1:04:24.320]  For a party that purports to be the champion of law and order
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:31.320]  Or indeed businesses to meet with those who are obstructing Wellingtonians from going about their everyday lives
[1:04:31.320 --> 1:04:35.320]  Bullying and harassing people who are trying to go to school or work
[1:04:35.320 --> 1:04:43.320]  I trusted the government and then I was forced to take a little bit of my job
[1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:50.320]  If we weren't coerced and brainwashed into getting these vaccines, he could still be alive
[1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:56.320]  If we weren't forced into making a choice between our jobs, incomes and livelihoods
[1:04:56.320 --> 1:05:02.320]  We are only offering three coins in the series
[1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:07.320]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days
[1:05:07.320 --> 1:05:15.320]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered
[1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:18.320]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:23.320]  Because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:26.320]  And keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants
[1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:34.320]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin
[1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:41.320]  It is powerful, witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history
[1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:47.320]  And be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future
[1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:50.320]  Thanks to your support of this project
[1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:54.320]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air
[1:05:54.320 --> 1:06:20.320]  And also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com
[1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:50.320]  You know, I thought about different podcast names for the show
[1:06:50.320 --> 1:06:55.320]  And I really think policy of truth might be yet
[1:06:55.320 --> 1:06:59.320]  Because we follow faithfully a policy of truth
[1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:02.320]  And we get persecuted and we get attacked
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:09.320]  But everything good and civilization came from people standing up for what was right when the chips were down
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:16.320]  And so anytime I get upset, anytime I get a little scared, anytime I get angry and frustrated by the decisions I've made
[1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:20.320]  Putting me in a bad position personally, I realize God is in control
[1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:25.320]  And I'm doing the right thing and then any doubts are overwhelmed a thousand fold
[1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:30.320]  And my resolve becomes even stronger
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:42.320]  Because of my faith and my Lord and Savior and my intercessor Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:07:42.320 --> 1:07:47.320]  I want to go to your phone calls right now
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:52.320]  We have a lot of news and important clips and information we're going to be getting to here today
[1:07:52.320 --> 1:08:01.320]  But I wanted to just briefly talk some about the situation in Ukraine
[1:08:01.320 --> 1:08:16.320]  During the evening of yesterday, last night, a bunch of helicopters went across the border of Ukraine into Russia
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.320]  And blew up a large fuel depot, so that's a first there
[1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:29.320]  Zelensky removes two top Ukrainian generals, says he does not have time to deal with all the traitors
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:36.320]  Who knows if any of it's true, because whether you're for Zelensky or against him or neutral like I am, the guy is a damn liar
[1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:46.320]  Today another decision was made regarding anti-heroes, is what he calls them, he's the hero, because he's the gay porn star
[1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:54.320]  Now I do not have time to deal with all the traitors, but gradually they will all be punished, he said
[1:08:54.320 --> 1:09:00.320]  The generals, former chief of the main department of internal security, of the security service of Ukraine
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:09.320]  And the former head of the office of the security service of Ukraine have been stripped of their ranks
[1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:18.320]  And he's doing it with this classic green screen thing where he's outside in the courtyard and experts have looked at it and said it's green screen
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:26.320]  Oh but don't question that, the Democratic Party will sue you, you're not supposed to question anything these people put out
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:34.320]  Fires two top generals, so we've got that news, lot of craziness taking place
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:47.320]  But for me the big news is that it's official by every major economic aggregation group, forecasting group that the economy from two years of lockdowns is already devastated
[1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:56.320]  When you add the energy prices increasing, because the hyperinflation that started to set in, and then you add the war to it
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:04.320]  And more energy cut off, the rationing has already begun in Europe, and the prices are only spiraling out of control here
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:16.320]  And Joe Biden makes arrogant statements about, no I'm not going to reopen one of the pipelines, and I'm not going to take the moratorium I put on 14 months ago, 15 months ago, on no new drilling
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:24.320]  So, it's just criminal, and I'm going to explain something to go to your calls, and I know the general listeners get this, but
[1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:33.320]  When you're talking to a leftist moron, and you explain to them, hey, China opens a new coal powered plant every week
[1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:43.320]  And their energy is about a third the cost of ours from coal, we can't compete because they have the cheapest, most plentiful system
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:48.320]  And so do we, there's enough coal to go 10,000 years, and it actually is ancient carbon bound of the earth
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:54.320]  It actually makes the atmosphere richer in carbon dioxide and then in oxygen, because the plants then put oxygen out
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:11:03.320]  And all the studies show that oxygen and carbon dioxide used to be way higher in our atmosphere than it is now
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:08.320]  And that the health effects for plants and animals is just meteoric, what it does
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:11.320]  So it's just, again, everything they tell you, it's the opposite
[1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:15.320]  Now, does coal put out a lot of really bad toxins?
[1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:22.320]  If it's dirty coal, yes, they've got large deposits in two places in the world, two large deposits, there's smaller ones around the world
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:30.320]  But there's giant ones in Russia, and giant clean coal deposits in the western part of the US, mainly around Utah
[1:11:30.320 --> 1:11:36.320]  I mean, just a few hundred square mile areas has enough clean coal around the US at current rates over a hundred years
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:46.320]  But remember, Bill Clinton shut that down and immediately, Chinese coal company that had secured deals with Russia for its clean coal
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:51.320]  There's a little bit in China as well, doubled in price overnight
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:57.320]  So that's how the globalists work is, we got all this clean coal that burns, and there's no mercury, nothing, it's all clean
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:00.320]  Burns super clean
[1:12:00.320 --> 1:12:06.320]  And we don't get to use that, and then China burns mainly dirty coal, so does India, so does Mexico
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  The cheapest type, no scrubbers, nothing to contain it, so you can bury it in a mineshaft or whatever
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:21.320]  Because you're here in the US and in Europe, the coal power plants, since the 80s, nothing comes out of them but water, vapor and carbon dioxide
[1:12:21.320 --> 1:12:25.320]  So they list carbon dioxide as a pollutant, so they can shut those down, and you see the graphs
[1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:31.320]  Since the 1990s and the 2021 treaty that Bush senior signed on to
[1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:38.320]  They had cut coal burning by 64% in the United States
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:45.320]  And of course coal was the vast majority of our energy, so I obsess over things that most people are like, coal is super boring Alex
[1:12:45.320 --> 1:12:52.320]  Well, if you wonder why we can't make things in the US, or why have I sell a t-shirt made in the US that cost me ten bucks
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:58.320]  One made in Mexico cost me four, one made in China cost me one dollar
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:01.320]  Which I have not bought stuff from China, but that's the price
[1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:05.320]  You can get shirts made, printed, for a couple bucks in China
[1:13:05.320 --> 1:13:12.320]  Made and printed in the US, ten, twelve bucks, made and printed in Mexico, five bucks
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:18.320]  It's because of the regulations and the energy costs, remember Trump said, I'd love to have my ties made in America
[1:13:18.320 --> 1:13:22.320]  But they cost three hundred dollars to make your fine silk ties
[1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:26.320]  They cost me thirty bucks in China, and I can sell them for a hundred bucks to you
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:31.320]  I can't pay hundreds of dollars to make them in the US, and then sell you a tie for a thousand dollars
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:35.320]  I gotta have markup, I gotta pay for overhead
[1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:41.320]  And it's true, I mean, people say, well why are you selling shortwave radios made in China
[1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:44.320]  Well we used to sell Grundig radios made in Germany
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.320]  There isn't shortwave radios made in America, folks
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:50.320]  If there were, we'd be selling them
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:55.320]  But then when you sell the stuff made in America, a lot of folks don't buy it
[1:13:55.320 --> 1:14:00.320]  Because it cost thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred percent more, and I get it
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:05.320]  But that's the position we've been put in to be controlled, and it makes me so angry now
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:08.320]  That the whole new world order is about artificial scarcity
[1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:11.320]  The whole globalist system is about shutting everybody down
[1:14:11.320 --> 1:14:16.320]  And Klaus Schwab is now on TV at his World Government Summit going right now
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:22.320]  Saying, the old system's going down, you're gonna be bankrupt, but don't worry, we got a new system
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:26.320]  And the new system is eating bugs, social credit scores, hell on earth
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:31.320]  I mean, this is a mapped out deal, folks
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:35.320]  So please don't be sitting here in five years when things are ten times worse and say, man, Jones was really right
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:39.320]  Of course I'll be off the air far gone by then with the way this is going
[1:14:39.320 --> 1:14:45.320]  If this continues, let's stop this now, please, together, can we do this?
[1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:50.320]  People in corporations, people in government, let's come together and be smart
[1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:57.320]  Okay, I promise I'm going right to your calls, Bill and John and Evan and Denise and David and Jack and
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:02.320]  Bo and Kevin and Brian and JB, everybody
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:06.320]  We're gonna get to all of your calls on the other side
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.320]  Separately, listeners have really come through
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:12.320]  We're doing a lot of accounting, a lot of inventory around here
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:15.320]  And it found out that the big weak point was me
[1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:19.320]  I always love new t-shirts, always design new t-shirts, almost never promote them
[1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:23.320]  For every t-shirt I promote, I get ten different designs printed
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:28.320]  We have something like 200 designs, 63,000 t-shirts
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:32.320]  A lot of them are made in America, by the way, almost all of them are printed in America
[1:15:32.320 --> 1:15:36.320]  Women's shirts, men's shirts, children's stuff, everything
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:40.320]  Ball caps, flags, all of it is being sold at cost right now
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:44.320]  To clear this out and fund our operation, and all this is limited edition
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:46.320]  We're never gonna print any of these again
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:49.320]  The future will have limited designs with the low inventory, as we can't afford to keep big inventory
[1:15:49.320 --> 1:15:51.320]  But this is the best deal ever, and it's your help
[1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:55.320]  InfowarsStore.com, t-shirt blowout sale
[1:15:55.320 --> 1:16:03.320]  In December of 2021, Infowars offered the first in a three-part series
[1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:09.320]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin, and it sold out in ten days
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:14.320]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member coin
[1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.320]  We would not be on air today
[1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:22.320]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:25.320]  And it will probably sell out in ten days again
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.320]  It certainly needs to, to fund our operation
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:31.320]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[1:16:31.320 --> 1:16:36.320]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:40.320]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com

[1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:10.320]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.320]  Our new sleep support formula, down and out, is just the thing

[1:19:41.320 --> 1:19:45.320]  Which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees

[1:20:14.320 --> 1:20:21.320]  Every day, every hour, every broadcast is still on air, it's very precious
[1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:27.320]  The globalists have to take us off air because as everything we talked about comes true
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:33.320]  The power and influence of info wars will only grow stronger no matter what influence
[1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:36.320]  They try to put upon us to discredit us
[1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:41.320]  The influence of our track record of truth is something that cannot be overwhelmed
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:43.320]  That cannot be defeated
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:47.320]  It is the tyrant's weakness that forces them to kill you or put you in prison
[1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:52.320]  But if people aren't willing to take on the tyrants, at least in word, indeed
[1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:54.320]  Then we have no hope
[1:20:54.320 --> 1:20:56.320]  Let's go to your phone calls here on the Alex Jones show
[1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:58.320]  I want to thank you for holding
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:00.320]  Bill, in Pennsylvania, you're on the air
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:02.320]  You say you're a father
[1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:06.320]  Let's talk about young kids and the attack on their biology, their gender
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:08.320]  Go ahead
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:10.320]  Yeah, it's a father of five
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:12.320]  I don't feel it's right
[1:21:12.320 --> 1:21:15.320]  When I grew up, I didn't need that
[1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:20.320]  I just don't understand why they think that it's something that they should do
[1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:22.320]  They're not doing it because they're nice
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:26.320]  They're a part of a pervert pedophile guild that wants to destroy children's innocence
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:29.320]  That didn't put themselves on a moral high horse that they're the liberals
[1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:31.320]  What they are is a curse
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:35.320]  What they are is a dirty cult that wants to screw kids up so they can troll them for the rest of their lives
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:38.320]  Because they know they screw up their sexuality and confuse them
[1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:41.320]  They'll have zombies they can dominate
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:45.320]  I mean, why are the schools letting them in? They just don't care? Is that part of their plan?
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:47.320]  That they have them in their pockets?
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:49.320]  It's depopulation, sir
[1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:53.320]  If they can get enough people to take hormone blockers or have their genitals removed
[1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:55.320]  That's less people on the earth
[1:21:55.320 --> 1:21:59.320]  That's why they, at the end of the day, and it gets you used to everybody changing what they are
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:01.320]  To get you ready for the cyborg takeover
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:05.320]  This is all officially announced by the Davos Group, by the Club of Rome
[1:22:05.320 --> 1:22:09.320]  By the Bilderberg Group, by all of them
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:14.320]  You know, this country used to stand for something and now that just, you know, we don't
[1:22:14.320 --> 1:22:16.320]  There's nothing there
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:21.320]  Well, that's the problem, we were like, oh, yeah, we don't care if, you know, Bruce Jenner says he's a woman
[1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:22.320]  Let's be nice
[1:22:22.320 --> 1:22:24.320]  And then the next thing is, give us your children
[1:22:24.320 --> 1:22:26.320]  Absolutely, thank you for the call
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:28.320]  We're going to move quick to get everybody here
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:31.320]  Evan, Evan in California, Evan, thanks for calling
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:33.320]  It's an honor to talk to you
[1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:38.320]  You know, Alex, I want to blame what's going on in America on the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:44.320]  I'm here in California, I've done everything I could with talking to pastors
[1:22:44.320 --> 1:22:49.320]  Telling them, hey, we need to put up a fight against the drag queen story time and all these different things
[1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:52.320]  And I would just be told that I was an untolerant guy
[1:22:52.320 --> 1:22:58.320]  I started a website called JesusChristWorldWideMinistries.org
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:03.320]  Where I have videos up there, you know, explaining about the Prophet Muhammad
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:06.320]  I started websites like hisabortionmurder.com
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:10.320]  I did everything I could on a handyman's budget
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:15.320]  And I see the effect I've had with people coming to Christ and different things like that
[1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:20.320]  And I just want to challenge Christians, or people saying they're a Christian
[1:23:20.320 --> 1:23:24.320]  That if you believe there's a guy named Jesus, that doesn't make you a Christian
[1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:26.320]  That makes you a historian
[1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:29.320]  That makes you a person that just knows history
[1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:31.320]  A lot of Christians
[1:23:31.320 --> 1:23:37.320]  Alex, you've got guys that have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars listening to you
[1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:41.320]  And how come they're not giving half or 75% of their wealth to you?
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:43.320]  How come people aren't realizing...
[1:23:43.320 --> 1:23:46.320]  I'll tell you why, it's not because they're greedy
[1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:51.320]  They're afraid that the money will be discovered and they'll be attacked for giving me money
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:52.320]  That's the reason
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:57.320]  Well, that's a darn good reason and, you know, that people give
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:01.320]  Well, here's the deal, living in fear means you lose everything, so it's better to die on your feet
[1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:03.320]  Than live on your knees as a slave
[1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:07.320]  I don't have time to sit here and grovel with these new world order people anymore
[1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:10.320]  I'm just pissed that they're able to get away with all this crap and frustrated
[1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:14.320]  And my issue is not a fear issue, it is a disgust issue
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:17.320]  And every time I start thinking about what they're doing, it makes me angry
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:19.320]  God bless you, Evan, good to hear from you
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.320]  We're going to have to move quickly to everybody here
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:24.320]  Justin in Texas, thank you for calling
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:27.320]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:32.320]  We're vindicated, but that doesn't make it good, because it's very sad to see it all coming through
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:34.320]  It all happened just like we said it would
[1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:40.320]  Which means the globalists have been very well-plot out and are going to really kill everybody
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:43.320]  I mean, so far they've been carrying their plan out exactly as they said
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:46.320]  Now the mass extermination begins, according to their timetable
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:48.320]  You can already see the mass death beginning
[1:24:48.320 --> 1:24:51.320]  COVID, starvation, energy being cut off
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:55.320]  I mean, we're about to watch them kill 7 billion people
[1:24:55.320 --> 1:24:57.320]  Most of us will be dead
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:00.320]  I mean, it's incredible, like, they're really doing it
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:02.320]  Definitely
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:07.320]  Well, I'm a big fan of yours, me and my wife are founding members
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:08.320]  Thank you
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:09.320]  We've got both coins
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.320]  And let me just tell you something about that right now
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:14.320]  Justin, we literally would have had to lay off like 15, 20 people
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:16.320]  If you guys hadn't got the last coin or get this coin
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:19.320]  We are right there, you have on my children
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:21.320]  Exhausting and spending all my funds
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.320]  In fact, pull me the article yesterday
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.320]  They had an article saying Forbes is the data
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:29.320]  That I live in Dallas and have and am worth $130 million
[1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.320]  None of that's true
[1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:33.320]  It's all put out so people don't support us
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:35.320]  I don't have a million dollars, ladies and gentlemen
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:37.320]  I am spending everything I've got
[1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:39.320]  I'm full in and I love it
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.320]  But I'm telling you, we need your support
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:42.320]  Sorry, go ahead
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:48.320]  Yeah, also I'm an independent candidate for governor of Texas
[1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  And of course, they make it super hard for us
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:53.320]  Nobody's to jump in the race
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:55.320]  Because I'm not in a party
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:26:01.320]  I have to get 83,000 signatures between now and the end of June
[1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:03.320]  So I could use a lot of help
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:07.320]  My website is takebackourgovt.com
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:11.320]  And I will be outside of the Eric Church concert tonight
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:13.320]  In Fort Worth getting signatures
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:16.320]  And yeah, I just want to say me and my wife and six kids
[1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:18.320]  We've been longtime supporters
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:20.320]  Have bought the storeable foods
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:23.320]  Supermail vitality has got to be my favorite
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:26.320]  But yeah, we're with you
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:28.320]  We're not mega millionaires or anything
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.320]  But we're always trying to support you guys as much as we can
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:35.320]  Well, brother, it's people like you that have kept us from here
[1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:37.320]  And let me tell you, we have hit our stride
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.320]  Imple Wars is having a bigger effect now
[1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  Than it's ever had with basically everybody
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.320]  And that's why they're so desperate to shut us down
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:48.320]  Because we have proven we're right
[1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:50.320]  You have helped keep us on air
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:52.320]  Our audience of supporters is the best
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:54.320]  God bless you, sir
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:56.320]  Let's go to John in California
[1:26:56.320 --> 1:26:58.320]  John, you're up next, go ahead
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.320]  Hi Alex, first time, long time
[1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:02.320]  And no big deal at Sean
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:04.320]  But getting this real fast
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:06.320]  There is drag queen story time
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:08.320]  That's going to be three blocks from where I'm at
[1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:10.320]  At the cellar door bookstore
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:14.320]  At the preschool across the street from that very mall
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:16.320]  So I've talked to the area commander
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:19.320]  That they claim they're going to have the child crimes unit
[1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:20.320]  Take a look at these drag queens
[1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:22.320]  But in California if you want to entertain
[1:27:22.320 --> 1:27:23.320]  Like at the county fairground
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:25.320]  You've got to do a background check
[1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:26.320]  I want to know if these drag queens
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:28.320]  Have been background checked and vetted
[1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:30.320]  Well, it's like shooting fish in a barrel
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:31.320]  And I'm sure other people fought
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:32.320]  Up at the same time five years ago
[1:27:32.320 --> 1:27:34.320]  But we sat on air, go run their plates
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:36.320]  And we did it and gave it to police
[1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:39.320]  And it resulted in arrest on Houston
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:41.320]  These people literally a third of the time
[1:27:41.320 --> 1:27:43.320]  Are convicted but of all
[1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:44.320]  I agree with you Alex
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:46.320]  I've been following your coverage of that
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:48.320]  And I want to encourage everyone
[1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:49.320]  Especially if you're former military
[1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:51.320]  Go to infowarstore.com
[1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:53.320]  Look up that green hexagon logo t-shirt
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:55.320]  That thing that comes to you is a boot camp
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:56.320]  Issue skivvy shirt
[1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:57.320]  You're going to love it
[1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:58.320]  You'll wear it outside indoors
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:00.320]  Even under a polo shirt or something
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:02.320]  That's one of the best shirts I've ever bought
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:03.320]  From you Alex
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:04.320]  And I am looking at it right now
[1:28:04.320 --> 1:28:05.320]  On top of my laundry pile
[1:28:05.320 --> 1:28:06.320]  Because I took it off yesterday
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.320]  And I'm going to wash it and probably wear it again
[1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:11.320]  Tomorrow when people show up to
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.320]  Try to stop that drag queen story time event
[1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:14.320]  Well we love you brother
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.320]  Where is the pedophile story time
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:18.320]  Being held in California Red
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:20.320]  They're going to be here in Riverside, California
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.320]  At the Sellerdorf bookstore
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:24.320]  At 5-2-2-5 Canyon Crest Drive
[1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:26.320]  That's already three blocks from where I live
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:28.320]  I can't abide to have that in my neighborhood
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:30.320]  And again, how do we know they're not taking out
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:32.320]  The tender care preschool across the street
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:35.320]  Exactly, they can have their free association
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:36.320]  As long as it's not illegal
[1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:38.320]  But people need to check out peacefully
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:39.320]  Who it is
[1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:41.320]  And people need to
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.320]  Witness for themselves the mothers
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:45.320]  The zombie mothers that bring their children
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:46.320]  To like MOLOC
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:48.320]  And set them down on their labs
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:50.320]  I mean it is a sick ritual
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:52.320]  So God bless you and Godspeed Sean
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:53.320]  Thank you
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:54.320]  Well they arrived back in just a few minutes
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:28:55.320]  Stay with us
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:00.320]  In December of 2021
[1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:02.320]  Info Wars offered the first
[1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:04.320]  In a three-part series
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:07.320]  The 1776 Anti-Tyrant Coin
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:09.320]  And it sold out in 10 days
[1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:11.320]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:13.320]  Original, powerful coin
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:15.320]  A founding member coin
[1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:17.320]  We would not be on air today
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.320]  Now, the second coin
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:22.320]  The Liberty Tree Coin is being offered
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:24.320]  And it will probably sell out in 10 days
[1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:26.320]  Again, it certainly needs to
[1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:27.320]  In front of operation
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:29.320]  It is so historic
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.320]  And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:33.320]  About the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:35.320]  With the blood of Patriots and Tyrants
[1:29:35.320 --> 1:29:36.320]  And more
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:38.320]  See the coin for yourself
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:40.320]  At 1776coin.com
[1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:42.320]  It's also at infowarstore.com
[1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:43.320]  It's amazing
[1:29:43.320 --> 1:29:45.320]  There's only 10,000 of them
[1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:47.320]  And as a founding member
[1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:48.320]  If we're able to stay on the air
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:29:51.320]  We're planning something very, very special
[1:29:51.320 --> 1:29:53.320]  For everyone that helps us go to the next level
[1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:55.320]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:56.320]  While you still can
[1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:58.320]  At 1776coin.com
[1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:00.320]  We are only offering three coins
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:02.320]  In the series
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:04.320]  The first coin was released in December
[1:30:04.320 --> 1:30:05.320]  Of 2021
[1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:06.320]  And sold out in 10 days
[1:30:06.320 --> 1:30:08.320]  Now, the second coin
[1:30:08.320 --> 1:30:10.320]  As we enter the last days of March
[1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:12.320]  Into April, 2022
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:14.320]  Is now being offered
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:16.320]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days
[1:30:16.320 --> 1:30:18.320]  Again, because these are historic coins
[1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:20.320]  And because our amazing listeners
[1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.320]  Want to support freedom
[1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:24.320]  And keep info wars at the front lines
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:26.320]  Of the fight against these tyrants
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:28.320]  So, go for yourself
[1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:30.320]  To 1776coin.com
[1:30:30.320 --> 1:30:33.320]  And see the new Liberty Tree coin
[1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:35.320]  It is powerful
[1:30:35.320 --> 1:30:38.320]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself
[1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:40.320]  And have this piece of history
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:43.320]  And be part of the founding member system
[1:30:43.320 --> 1:30:46.320]  That we're set to launch in the very near future
[1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:49.320]  Thanks to your support of this project
[1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:51.320]  Get a historic memento
[1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:53.320]  That helps keep info wars on the air
[1:30:53.320 --> 1:30:56.320]  And also gives you a real piece of history
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:30:58.320]  At 1776coin.com
[1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:00.320]  New and run contact tracers aren't coming
[1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:02.320]  They're here, all over the world
[1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:04.320]  From Australia to the United States
[1:31:04.320 --> 1:31:06.320]  From Canada to Germany
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:08.320]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:10.320]  Everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.320]  And threatening in some cases actually
[1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:14.320]  Taking people away into the night
[1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:16.320]  To their facilities
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:18.320]  And they're planning in the next year
[1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:20.320]  To expand their shield process
[1:31:20.320 --> 1:31:22.320]  Where they come and take, quote, healthy people away
[1:31:22.320 --> 1:31:24.320]  And put them in facilities for their safety
[1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:26.320]  This is nothing less than martial law
[1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:28.320]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:30.320]  Is to get high quality Faraday cages
[1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:32.320]  Many of which are made here in America
[1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:34.320]  And are very compliant
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:36.320]  Meaning U.S. government military grade
[1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:38.320]  At infowarstore.com
[1:31:38.320 --> 1:31:40.320]  We have the entire line of silent pocket
[1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:43.320]  Ready to ship to you when you visit infowarstore.com
[1:31:43.320 --> 1:31:45.320]  Again, we have big backpacks
[1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:47.320]  We have special dry bags
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:49.320]  We've got them for cell phones
[1:31:49.320 --> 1:31:51.320]  We've got them for laptops
[1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:53.320]  We've got them for iPads
[1:31:53.320 --> 1:31:55.320]  It's all there at infowarstore.com
[1:31:55.320 --> 1:31:58.320]  And support the infowar at infowarstore.com
[1:31:59.320 --> 1:32:02.320]  There is very little contemporary study
[1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:06.320]  In the world of the planet's ruling class
[1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:09.320]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico
[1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:12.320]  Not in the United States, not anywhere
[1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:15.320]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class
[1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:17.320]  And that's done by design
[1:32:17.320 --> 1:32:20.320]  The large central banks that basically control the planet
[1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:23.320]  Will penalize and target any academics
[1:32:23.320 --> 1:32:26.320]  That look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:28.320]  The founder of the Bilderberg Group
[1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:30.320]  The Trilateral Commission of the United Nations
[1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:33.320]  The whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers
[1:32:33.320 --> 1:32:35.320]  Until ten years ago, the media said
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:38.320]  The control corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:40.320]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public
[1:32:40.320 --> 1:32:42.320]  And its former head
[1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:45.320]  Show on the steering committee is Klaus Schwab
[1:32:45.320 --> 1:32:48.320]  And he has set up the great reset in global government
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:50.320]  And as a liberty movement worldwide
[1:32:50.320 --> 1:32:52.320]  We don't address the globalist head-on
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:54.320]  About the second thing are worldwide
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:32:56.320]  Authoritarian corporate takeover
[1:32:56.320 --> 1:32:57.320]  We don't have a shot
[1:32:57.320 --> 1:33:26.320]  To expose them we can beat them easily
[1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:30.320]  Welcome to your life
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:37.320]  We're taking phone calls
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.320]  Let's talk to Jack
[1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:44.320]  In Wisconsin
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:46.320]  Jack, thanks for calling, go ahead
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:49.320]  Happy April Fool's, Mr. Jones
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:52.320]  It seems like everybody wants to control the world, eh?
[1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:53.320]  Yeah, absolutely
[1:33:53.320 --> 1:33:54.320]  I sure know I don't
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:56.320]  That's the problem and you don't either
[1:33:56.320 --> 1:33:58.320]  All the normal people just want to be left alone
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:00.320]  But yeah, all the evil people want to rule the world
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:04.320]  Yep, can I make a plug for X3 real quick?
[1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:06.320]  Absolutely
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.320]  Sure, I'm a big fan of X3 iodine
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:11.320]  And iodine in general
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:14.320]  You've mentioned it before on previous shows
[1:34:14.320 --> 1:34:17.320]  About hippies taking it after tripping a lot
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:21.320]  And I took seven grams of mushrooms in Amsterdam
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:23.320]  And went to the Anne Frank Museum
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:26.320]  And also had other head trauma
[1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.320]  And that stuff definitely brings you back
[1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:32.320]  And I think it more so reconnects to your signal
[1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:36.320]  Of your forever self pre-birth and post-death
[1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:39.320]  That's right, clean iodine is the most important thing
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:41.320]  For electrochemical activity
[1:34:41.320 --> 1:34:44.320]  Then there's a few of the things in the body
[1:34:44.320 --> 1:34:48.320]  That are almost as important, but they all go together
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:52.320]  Yes, yes, I wanted to see if you heard from
[1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:55.320]  Russian news and over there in the Balkans
[1:34:55.320 --> 1:34:58.320]  They had a video, I know you're a fan of
[1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:02.320]  Conspiracy theory slash alternative hypothesis
[1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:06.320]  And it was a video that I thought would interest you
[1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:11.320]  Where Russian soldiers captured a false flagger
[1:35:11.320 --> 1:35:17.320]  Using artillery on Ukrainian soldiers
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.320]  And on themselves and they took the false flagger
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:22.320]  Out to the townspeople and made them confess
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:25.320]  In front of the townspeople and in front of video cameras
[1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:28.320]  And I thought that was very interesting
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:31.320]  And this whole gas war is rather unfortunate
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:34.320]  Where how you said we listened to Nikola Tesla
[1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:36.320]  And were truly progressive
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:39.320]  We wouldn't be having such wars over gas
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:41.320]  I'm all about moving away from fossil fuels
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.320]  But what they do, windmills and stuff
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:45.320]  Don't work, it's all a fraud, God bless you
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:47.320]  Thank you for the call
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:51.320]  Absolutely, selenium and iodine
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:53.320]  You have to have for all cellular activity
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:55.320]  Electrochemical activity
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:57.320]  And so the cells can communicate and operate
[1:35:57.320 --> 1:36:00.320]  If you don't have that and good clean iodine
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:01.320]  It's so amazing
[1:36:01.320 --> 1:36:03.320]  Still a little bit of X3 left
[1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:05.320]  X2 has been sold out for a long time
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:06.320]  But X3 is amazing
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  Alright, let's go back to the calls
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:12.320]  Who's been holding longest now?
[1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:15.320]  That would be Beau in the great state of Texas
[1:36:15.320 --> 1:36:17.320]  Beau, thanks for calling
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:20.320]  Hey Alex, it's Beau from Freedom Town USA
[1:36:20.320 --> 1:36:22.320]  Junction Texas
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.320]  I'm a proud listener of your show
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.320]  And it's an honor to be speaking to you today
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:27.320]  Buddy, it's an honor to talk to you
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:29.320]  What's on your mind?
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.320]  My question was regarding the Russia-Ukraine war
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  What does it mean for the world order
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:38.320]  If the Russian ruble can completely recover
[1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:41.320]  From western sanctions in five weeks
[1:36:41.320 --> 1:36:44.320]  I mean, does this mean that governments can resist
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:47.320]  The world economic takeover?
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:50.320]  You know, is there some type of ground
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:53.320]  That our governments have against this type of control
[1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:54.320]  They're trying to...
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:55.320]  Well, I totally agree
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:57.320]  That the globalists want to collapse little people
[1:36:57.320 --> 1:36:58.320]  But not themselves
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:00.320]  But they've already had to back off the fertilizer ban
[1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:02.320]  Because that was going to collapse everything too fast
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.320]  And yeah, Russia, the ruble is now trending up
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:10.320]  And the dollar is trending down for the first time ever
[1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:12.320]  And so yes
[1:37:12.320 --> 1:37:16.320]  The globalists are losing their fight right now
[1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:18.320]  And again, I'm not saying I'm on Russia's side
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:19.320]  Or anybody's side
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:21.320]  It's just that this whole thing is not even going good
[1:37:21.320 --> 1:37:22.320]  For the globalists
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:25.320]  That thought this war would help them collapse the whole system
[1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:26.320]  But not themselves
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:28.320]  But it's collapsing them so fast
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:29.320]  They're trying to pull back
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:30.320]  So good point
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:34.320]  I mean, do you think that there's nations out there
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:37.320]  I mean, you know, with China and Russia
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:40.320]  If they just say we're not going along with this program
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:44.320]  Is there recourse for governments and is there safe havens?
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:47.320]  I'm not saying China or Russia is a safe haven against this
[1:37:47.320 --> 1:37:49.320]  But they're done...
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:51.320]  You would say there is some type of pushback
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:53.320]  At the very least again
[1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:54.320]  Oh, absolutely
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:57.320]  I mean, currently the ruble is up and the dollar is down
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:00.320]  And the sanctions against Russia have backfired on Europe
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:01.320]  And the United States
[1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:03.320]  But again, there's a larger plan
[1:38:03.320 --> 1:38:05.320]  Where Biden's cutting off our resources as well
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:09.320]  They just want to be able to blame Russia
[1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:11.320]  For the collapse that they've already instituted
[1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.320]  But if the collapse gets too intense
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:14.320]  It could bring them down
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:19.320]  So now they're trying to basically mitigate the crisis
[1:38:19.320 --> 1:38:20.320]  They've already created
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  God bless you, Beau
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:22.320]  Thank you for calling
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:23.320]  We're moving quick here
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:25.320]  A lot of great callers
[1:38:25.320 --> 1:38:26.320]  I can talk to you all for 10 hours
[1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:27.320]  We got to move faster
[1:38:27.320 --> 1:38:28.320]  Get to everybody
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:33.320]  Up next here is Brian in New Jersey
[1:38:33.320 --> 1:38:35.320]  Sharing info wars, short videos
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:37.320]  Supporting the info wars
[1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:38.320]  What he wants to talk about
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:39.320]  Go ahead, Brian
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:40.320]  Thanks for calling
[1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:41.320]  Alex, it is
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:42.320]  God bless you
[1:38:42.320 --> 1:38:44.320]  Thank you for taking my call
[1:38:44.320 --> 1:38:46.320]  You woke me up 17 years ago
[1:38:46.320 --> 1:38:47.320]  And then you and I actually met
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:49.320]  September 11th, 2007
[1:38:49.320 --> 1:38:52.320]  Some of my footage ended up in Endgame
[1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:57.320]  I think that I have identified a huge weak point
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:58.320]  In the New World Order
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:02.320]  And you have the tungsten rod in your pocket already
[1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:05.320]  These promos that you guys do in between segments
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:07.320]  At least when I listen on the internet
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:10.320]  Like if Gallo Tumor that is in there
[1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.320]  The 30 second, 45 second and one minute clips
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:14.320]  That you have are phenomenal
[1:39:14.320 --> 1:39:16.320]  And I wish that there was an archive
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:17.320]  On Band-Aid video
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:19.320]  That I could just send those out
[1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:21.320]  To my social media platforms
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:23.320]  Because somebody will watch a 30 second, 45 second
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:24.320]  One minute video
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.320]  And they are entertaining
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:27.320]  They're perfect
[1:39:27.320 --> 1:39:29.320]  And I honestly believe that they are
[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:31.320]  Just a huge weapon that you really want
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:32.320]  It is you the listeners
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:33.320]  All this is free to air
[1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:36.320]  None of it's trademark, copyright, use everything
[1:39:36.320 --> 1:39:38.320]  Edit it, expand on it, make it shorter
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:40.320]  Make it longer, mix it, do whatever
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:43.320]  It's the listeners on Instagram and YouTube
[1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:46.320]  And Twitter and then on Rumble
[1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:50.320]  And then on Getter and all these things
[1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:54.320]  That are just doing incredible things
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:55.320]  With the show
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:57.320]  So it's you guys and gals
[1:39:57.320 --> 1:39:59.320]  The real maestros, the real artists
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:01.320]  So please take everything and edit it
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:03.320]  And get it out there
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:04.320]  Thank you Alex, bless you
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:05.320]  Have a great day
[1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:08.320]  YouTube brother, appreciate you, bless you
[1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:09.320]  I love the listeners
[1:40:09.320 --> 1:40:10.320]  But I want to hear your info
[1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:12.320]  I love you, you love me
[1:40:12.320 --> 1:40:13.320]  Together we're in this fight
[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:15.320]  And I do salute you, so thank you
[1:40:15.320 --> 1:40:18.320]  But it just gets a little
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:20.320]  Not obscene, it's okay to have a love fast
[1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:22.320]  But thank you for your appreciation
[1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:23.320]  Just kind of you're up here on TV
[1:40:23.320 --> 1:40:24.320]  Everybody's loving on you
[1:40:24.320 --> 1:40:25.320]  And I love right back on you
[1:40:25.320 --> 1:40:28.320]  But let's get on the attack against the globalists
[1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:32.320]  Let's go ahead and take more calls here
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:34.320]  Who's been home the longest here
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:37.320]  That would be Kevin
[1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:38.320]  Kevin in Michigan
[1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:42.320]  Kevin, welcome and thank you for calling
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:43.320]  Hi Alex
[1:40:43.320 --> 1:40:45.320]  Been listening to you for a couple years now
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:48.320]  And honestly, but wish I would have
[1:40:48.320 --> 1:40:51.320]  You know, heard your name a lot sooner
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:53.320]  Because I don't know
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:57.320]  My life's been crazy ever since
[1:40:57.320 --> 1:41:00.320]  I've, you know, heard all this
[1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:03.320]  Just information, it's insane
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:07.320]  So the call, I was a little nervous
[1:41:07.320 --> 1:41:08.320]  First time caller, obviously
[1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:09.320]  Hey, we love you brother
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:12.320]  But hey, aren't you glad now you see over the horizon
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:13.320]  Think about the general public
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:14.320]  Doesn't know what's hitting them
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:16.320]  So it's scary to know what's hitting you
[1:41:16.320 --> 1:41:18.320]  But imagine not knowing
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:20.320]  Isn't it better to know?
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:23.320]  Well, it's just mind blowing how elementary
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.320]  All of this manipulation on society is
[1:41:27.320 --> 1:41:30.320]  It's just bad, it's elementary
[1:41:30.320 --> 1:41:33.320]  And it's so hard to get through to people
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:37.320]  When you try to show them your side of
[1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:39.320]  Well, have you heard these facts
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:41.320]  And have you read these articles?
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:43.320]  Have you heard from these experts?
[1:41:43.320 --> 1:41:47.320]  And it's like you challenging their viewpoint
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:50.320]  Is an automatic like they're on the attack
[1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:52.320]  Instead of being opening and listening
[1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:54.320]  You know what, don't hang up Kevin
[1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.320]  Because you're saying something really, really important here
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:41:59.320]  And I want to come back and give you a few minutes
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:01.320]  To have to say and then we'll go to everybody else
[1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:03.320]  That's patiently holding like Rodney and Kevin
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:09.320]  And Denise and JR and Tom and Hymey and Tom
[1:42:09.320 --> 1:42:10.320]  And Mike and so many others
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:12.320]  We're going to get to everybody today
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:13.320]  So honored to take your calls
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:16.320]  We're going to move quickly and come back
[1:42:16.320 --> 1:42:18.320]  But what he's saying is absolutely true
[1:42:18.320 --> 1:42:21.320]  Once you're informed, it's like how do people not see it
[1:42:21.320 --> 1:42:23.320]  They're having a world government conference
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:26.320]  Saying they're going to make us all poor and control us
[1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:29.320]  And all this horrible world government stuff
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:30.320]  With cashless societies
[1:42:30.320 --> 1:42:33.320]  And then the New York Times says it doesn't exist
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:35.320]  And then the general public when you try to warn them
[1:42:35.320 --> 1:42:38.320]  Goes, why are you showing off and telling me something?
[1:42:38.320 --> 1:42:41.320]  It's not normal to warn me about something
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:42.320]  Why do you care about me?
[1:42:42.320 --> 1:42:43.320]  That's kind of weird
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:45.320]  Now if you wanted to have sex with my kid
[1:42:45.320 --> 1:42:47.320]  It's totally normal, dragling story economy
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:48.320]  I am for pedophilia, I'm a liberal
[1:42:48.320 --> 1:42:50.320]  But don't tell me about any corrupt elites
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:52.320]  It's just a spirit of delusion
[1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:57.320]  Lost satanic people
[1:42:57.320 --> 1:42:58.320]  You know, it's a fact
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:00.320]  And I'm out bragging when I say it, it's just true
[1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:03.320]  That M4 Wars is seen by the globalist
[1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:05.320]  As the standard of human liberty
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:10.320]  As the logo of human populist resistance
[1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:14.320]  Against their transhumanist anti-human program
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:17.320]  And man, our work is really right now
[1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:20.320]  Hitting the most important aspects
[1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:21.320]  Of what we've ever done
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:24.320]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize
[1:43:24.320 --> 1:43:27.320]  We've got great products, thousands of them
[1:43:27.320 --> 1:43:28.320]  At M4WarsTour.com

[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:36.320]  Because this fight has intensified
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:38.320]  Don't need me to tell you that

[1:44:27.320 --> 1:44:29.320]  Is the M4 WarsTour.com line

[1:44:33.320 --> 1:44:34.320]  Triple eight, two five, three, one, three, nine
[1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:35.720]  Is the M4 WarsTour.com is simply the best
[1:44:36.320 --> 1:44:39.320]  M4WarsTour.com beats out all the rest
[1:44:39.320 --> 1:45:03.880]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth, then the
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:11.080]  next big casualty isn't even the people that die. No, that invariably follows. But first
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:18.880]  there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:24.520]  And now across the world, in the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[1:45:24.520 --> 1:45:33.200]  that if you amplify any, quote, pro-Russian information, you can be censored, you can
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:38.560]  be arrested, you can be imprisoned. And of course now, Canada is under this legislation
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:45.200]  that if you have a fought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech
[1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:50.720]  online, that you will be censored and arrested. Ladies and gentlemen, authoritarianism is
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:55.680]  being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes inforwars.com
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:45:56.680]  more important than ever.
[1:45:56.680 --> 1:46:03.960]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training, probably not as much as
[1:46:03.960 --> 1:46:08.320]  they should be, but thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for inforwarsstore.com.
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:14.360]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:19.240]  to get going, you know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins
[1:46:19.240 --> 1:46:24.480]  I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy and the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:28.760]  for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then
[1:46:28.760 --> 1:46:34.960]  every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones' sore list. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:40.080]  is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support
[1:46:40.080 --> 1:46:45.200]  and extra flexibility. The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the
[1:46:45.200 --> 1:46:50.520]  training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force
[1:46:50.520 --> 1:46:54.880]  that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore list can keep
[1:46:54.880 --> 1:47:00.200]  you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:18.840]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones. Wow, look
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:28.520]  at these headlines. It's an all market story that links to all their quotes. Really powerful.
[1:47:28.520 --> 1:47:34.480]  Next link that you should read it and share it on info wars.com. What is the great reset
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:38.560]  and what do the globalists actually want? You might want to know what the captains of
[1:47:38.560 --> 1:47:46.320]  the ship, the hijackers actually want. Another big article by Don Salazar on info wars.com.
[1:47:46.320 --> 1:47:51.200]  Info wars right again. World Health Organization admits COVID vaccine link to hearing loss.
[1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:59.280]  Yep, that's what blood clots do. Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. And they'll even let
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:02.640]  it come out that the vaccine wasn't a vaccine. It was poisoned later because no one ever
[1:48:02.640 --> 1:48:08.040]  gets in trouble. They just set the precedent to do what they want when they want. But going
[1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:16.040]  back to Kevin in Michigan, he was bringing up the surrealness of it's out of the open
[1:48:16.040 --> 1:48:20.440]  and then you warn people and they think you're showing off. It's because they were in a trance.
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:25.120]  They're lazy. They've already got what they want to do in their mind and they think, well,
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:30.080]  why are you talking to me? That's weird. And really they're not activated people. They've
[1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.800]  been put in a trance by the TV, the culture. They're not connected to God. They're lost.
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:41.360]  And they think that you want something because they've given up on life. So you just got
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:47.120]  to move on to people that still have the fire of life, still have the potential and then
[1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:51.000]  get with them and try to help them so they can help you as well together make it through
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.880]  this. That's why they target children because they have that spark of humanity and if they're
[1:48:54.880 --> 1:49:00.200]  given the right leadership and are around the right people, it can supercharge them
[1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:05.960]  and encourage them and amplify their great attributes and gifts God gave them. And that's
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:11.320]  why they target the children to screw them up early and make their whole life be about
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:16.840]  whatever weird sexual program the pedophiles put into them. So this is all very scientific
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:26.360]  what these evil doers are up to brother. Absolutely. It goes back to, you know, the CIA operations
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:34.720]  of MK ultra and, you know, MTA ultra is brought up a lot. And even in, you know, movies and
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:40.880]  shows these days, Stranger Things, one of the most popular shows on Netflix is about
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:49.320]  the main character is an MK ultra experiment T and she has telekinetic telekinetic powers
[1:49:49.320 --> 1:49:54.640]  and all how they're using it to, you know, who the people of all, you know, maybe it's
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:50:00.240]  not so bad because the, the TV, you know, everything on TV glorifies all this stuff
[1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:06.000]  and like they leak it. It's all subliminal leaking. And, you know, you hear, and then
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:10.600]  we believe it because we're made the image of God and have enough technology. Now we
[1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:15.000]  then manifest it. So humans didn't have technology before, but envisioned all this stuff that
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:19.480]  was already pre-programmed in us. Now that we have the technology, we can actually build
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:25.760]  and manifest what we imagine. So they program us to then manifest what they want us to.
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.120]  So that is absolutely how it works, brother. God bless you and thank you for calling, Kevin.
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:33.120]  All right. Up next, ladies and gentlemen, in the order of these wonderful calls been
[1:50:33.120 --> 1:50:42.640]  received. Let's talk to Tony in New York. Tony, thank you for calling Tom. I'm sorry.
[1:50:42.640 --> 1:50:45.560]  I can't read anymore. Tom, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:50:45.560 --> 1:50:51.840]  General Jones, sir. It's a pleasure and an honor. I've been a, I don't know, 20 years
[1:50:51.840 --> 1:50:56.680]  of following you. I bought everything that you got for sale over there.
[1:50:56.680 --> 1:50:59.840]  Well, then you built this son of a bitch. So we love you, brother.
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:04.680]  Well, listen, here's, here's just one more idea that, you know, I bought that reset wars
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:10.080]  and I got to tell you, brother, you hit it right out of the park there. I've gone through
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:15.680]  that course twice now and I'm still gleaning things out of it that I missed the first
[1:51:15.680 --> 1:51:22.120]  time around. But listen, you know, you think that people would get upset when you started
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.200]  offering it for lesser price and this and that. Alex, you got to get that out there
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:32.000]  for free, but fund it. And I've thought of a way to do it.
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:35.880]  Tell me. Okay. You know, I've been watching you with
[1:51:35.880 --> 1:51:40.480]  your show notes for years and you're, oh, you got little scribbles and you, you know,
[1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:46.800]  you do the parentheses around the headlines and this and that. Alex, you've got a trove
[1:51:46.800 --> 1:51:53.280]  of money sitting right in front of you that if you sold the show notes to people that
[1:51:53.280 --> 1:51:57.080]  would, you know, listeners have said that and so have the crew a little like I was just
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:01.880]  drawing this like Viking ship thing while you were talking and you're right. I do scribble
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:05.800]  a lot of weird, crazy stuff. I mean, you don't have to sign your name
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:11.240]  or nothing. People would know exactly where that came from and who did it because that
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:17.880]  is your signature, the show notes. And you know, I'll tell you something, just a side
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:24.360]  topic real quick. I feel like the church is missing its opportunity right now to speak
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:32.120]  out and I think it's because everyone's waiting on this rapture. Okay. Well, you know what?
[1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:37.920]  I don't care when the rapture happens pre-posed or exactly. I'm not even going to have the
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:42.680]  debate with them. You've got a job to stand up to evil folks. And so, okay, whenever it
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:46.760]  happens, you know, the point is we need to do something now.
[1:52:46.760 --> 1:52:53.440]  That's right. That's right. And it's caused great angst amongst my personal family. Okay.
[1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:58.840]  So, but that's about it, Alex. I just love you, man. I was there near you, you know,
[1:52:58.840 --> 1:53:07.480]  on a certain date, a certain place. And just keep, keep, just stay healthy, buddy. Okay.
[1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:13.360]  Brother, we need you and we thank you. I mean, look, big events are about to happen. We're
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:18.280]  221 days out from the election. The Democrats have written their whole script that people
[1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:21.920]  that question elections are terrorists and are about to carry out terror attacks. Homeless
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:26.400]  security said a month ago, we believe Trump supporters are going to blow stuff up or shoot
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:31.160]  people soon. Well, they're winding up the nuts to do it into the election. Oh, look,
[1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:37.160]  the Republicans who are about to win an election blew things up so they wouldn't win the election.
[1:53:37.160 --> 1:53:41.680]  So they're looking to provocateur or stage or whatever they can in an event and they're
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:46.320]  literally got all their indictments ready for Trump and Giuliani and a bunch of other
[1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:51.960]  people right now for that sometime before the election, probably in the middle of the
[1:53:51.960 --> 1:53:59.800]  summer. So I mean, I should just be talking about this 3-4 hours a day because we can
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:03.640]  talk about Russia, talk about the economy, talk about the energy crisis. They don't
[1:54:03.640 --> 1:54:08.160]  want us on air pointing out the globalists did this. And so if you think you've seen
[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:13.040]  censorship, if you think you've seen problems, they're planning an authoritarian final takeover
[1:54:13.040 --> 1:54:21.040]  in the next 221 days on record. And so just store the articles, record the show, save
[1:54:21.040 --> 1:54:24.040]  it on thumb drives because I don't know how long we'll be here, folks. I don't know how
[1:54:24.040 --> 1:54:28.360]  long you're going to be here. I mean, it's that bad. Folks, I only tell you what I think
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:31.960]  is really going down. And I hope that people will get awake and there's good people in
[1:54:31.960 --> 1:54:36.600]  government corporations and in the media and we say no, but we need to realize how much
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:40.800]  trouble we're in or it's going to happen. The bad stuff is going to take over.
[1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:46.240]  Okay. Up next here is Mike in Texas. Mike, thank you for calling. Go ahead.
[1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:58.880]  Yes. Good morning, Alex. Good day. Yes, sir. The other day, Sherry Tenpenny was saying
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:08.000]  something that caught my attention. She claimed that treaties override the U.S. Constitution.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:15.280]  It's not true. That's not true. I didn't hear you correct her at the time.
[1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:19.480]  Well, I didn't because there's an interpretation they do, but they really don't and then that's
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:24.840]  an issue. Most of the treaties we implement never got ratified anyway, so it's all a fraud.
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:30.840]  Yeah. This was a pernicious idea that the Dulles brothers concocted how they could unravel
[1:55:30.840 --> 1:55:34.760]  the Constitution using. Hey, Mike, your phone was cutting out. I didn't recognize you've
[1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:41.520]  been calling 20 years. This is Dr. Mike. Yeah. Yeah. You're, you're, you're still good,
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:46.440]  Alex. Mike, can we, can you believe we're living in the end game, brother? Can you believe
[1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:52.640]  that for all these years it's going down? I'm reading my Bible a lot more these days
[1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:58.560]  than ever before. Trying to, trying to make sense of it because these, whether we, whether
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:04.320]  we think these guys believe in Satan in the God of the Bible, they're clearly they're
[1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:08.640]  scripting their act to control. Yeah. Whether they believe in Satan themselves or not, they're
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:15.600]  operating system of Satan. Sorry. Keep going. Yeah. Yeah. So it's important to, to understand
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:22.800]  that these, these people are accelerationists, apparently that, that term refers to it can
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:30.120]  be Christians, it could be Muslims, it could be Jews who see that there's chaos, regardless
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:36.200]  of which, which of the three Abrahamic faiths you, you believe in the end times involves
[1:56:36.200 --> 1:56:44.440]  chaos. And so they, they try to create chaos in order to accelerate, bring about quickly,
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:53.600]  more quickly the, the end times. It's a, that's a bizarre theory, bizarre way to live. But
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:56.920]  I think that's what these people said, Mike, Dr. Mike, don't hang up. I'm going to come
[1:56:56.920 --> 1:57:00.840]  right back to you in the next segment to get more of what you have to say. And we got G,
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:05.480]  we got Rodney, we got Seth, we got some special impulse, a special guest coming in. We're
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:10.640]  going to go to break. Please remember, it's going to sell out the next week or sooner.
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:14.480]  And I want you to have a piece of history and it keeps us on air. And yeah, there's a markup
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:18.400]  on it to fund the operation. It's a founder coin. Everybody that gets the coin, if you
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:23.160]  give us your email, we'll get some very special stuff in the future if we're still on air.
[1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:26.920]  But it's building a lot of emergency backups, a lot of important things. Believe me, you
[1:57:26.920 --> 1:57:33.240]  want to be a founding member, get your coin now at 1776coin.com or the front page of info
[1:57:33.240 --> 1:57:39.520]  or store.com has a link to it. It's the free of liberty coin. It's historic. It's amazing.
[1:57:39.520 --> 1:57:48.280]  And it's going to sell out fast. Get yours while you still can info or store.com.
[1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:55.960]  In December of 2021, info wars offered the first in a three part series, the 1776 anti
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:58:01.480]  tyrant coin, and it's sold out in 10 days. And if it wasn't for listeners getting this
[1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:08.200]  original, powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today. Now the
[1:58:08.200 --> 1:58:13.760]  second coin, the Liberty tree coin is being offered, and it will probably sell out in
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:19.880]  10 days again. It certainly needs to the front of operation. It is so historic. And it has
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:24.120]  a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the tree of liberty being refreshed with the blood
[1:58:24.120 --> 1:58:31.200]  of patriots and tyrants and more. See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com. It's also
[1:58:31.200 --> 1:58:36.600]  an info or store.com. It's amazing. There's only 10,000 of them. And as a founding member,
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:41.840]  if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special for everyone
[1:58:41.840 --> 1:58:45.480]  that helps us go to the next level. So get your new tree of liberty coin while you still
[1:58:45.480 --> 1:58:53.160]  can at 1776coin.com. Ladies and gentlemen, info wars store.com is offering the biggest
[1:58:53.160 --> 1:59:00.920]  sales in its over 20 year history. And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:06.920]  is exploding, the supply chains have broken down. And info wars is having serious trouble
[1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:12.160]  making its payroll and paying for operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in
[1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:16.440]  the face of the globalists making their main move in full wars. It's paradoxical is more
[1:59:16.440 --> 1:59:21.360]  popular than ever. It is reaching more people than ever, despite the center ship. But because
[1:59:21.360 --> 1:59:24.920]  of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth,
[1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:32.000]  everything else, we are running out of money. So listen up to 75% off info wars store.com
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:37.320]  on things like amazing Patriot t shirts that helps spread the word and fund the operation

[1:59:49.560 --> 1:59:57.200]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:59:57.200 --> 2:00:08.080]  All right, I want to go to Rodney in Missouri in a moment. It said he attended the January
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:13.640]  six is a counter with Ray Epps, the federal agent. That's coming up in a moment. But first
[2:00:13.640 --> 2:00:18.880]  Mike in Texas, who's a medical doctor, he's been calling for over 20 years, always has
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:24.800]  great points. Mike, what else does he want to add, sir?
[2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:30.520]  Mike is still there from Texas. Mike may have thought here. Sorry, I accidentally hit
[2:00:30.520 --> 2:00:35.640]  my chance. I was interrupting you. What is it you tried to call in about?
[2:00:35.640 --> 2:00:44.360]  The last heard Dr. Pachinic had some kind of medical or family emergency in the effort
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:48.680]  to try to get him back on the show. I know what's going on with Pachinic and it's private
[2:00:48.680 --> 2:00:54.400]  and it is medical and that's all I'm gonna say. Okay, I just I'd like to hear his input
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:58.760]  about he legitimately thought that I guess they were gonna have the all that with the
[2:00:58.760 --> 2:01:02.480]  ballots and all the rest of it. He's I don't think he's a bad guy. And yeah, obviously
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:06.800]  I've been trying to get him on for six months. And he has not been able to come on. I've
[2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:12.280]  talked to his wife and other folks and I'll leave it at that. We should pray for Dr. Pachinic.
[2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:21.280]  Okay, all right, we'll do. Somebody sent me an article from veterans today, which which
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:26.680]  was fascinating. A little bit of history that had dropped down the memory hole about this
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:36.320]  this land east of Europe, west of China, that it was referred to by the ancients in both
[2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:43.400]  areas of the world as the names dealers. Business travelers would go through this this area
[2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:51.320]  between the black and Caspian Sea. And they'd be invited. I end up one of the locals treated
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:58.520]  royally, you know, come be wine and dine by us. Tell us about yourself. Give us your name.
[2:01:58.520 --> 2:02:06.840]  And they would be poisoned, killed. And one of the members of the tribe in this area would
[2:02:06.840 --> 2:02:12.800]  then continue on with this whatever mission this guy was on, either heading off to China
[2:02:12.800 --> 2:02:19.240]  or in the opposite direction from China on to Western Europe. And yeah, there were lots
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:25.120]  of those scams. The Thuggy did that and the Khazars did that. Exactly. This was this was
[2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:31.480]  Khazaria, Scythia, it was north just north of Babylon. So this and notice George Lucas
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:39.080]  calls this the bad guys in that the Sith. Yeah, yeah, these are the people that came
[2:02:39.080 --> 2:02:46.000]  out of Babylon. These this is a Babylonian hybrid between what you could loosely call
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:52.560]  Judaism. It's not it's not true Judaism. This is exactly what the Bible says and means when
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  it talks about the synagogue of Satan. These are this is a Luciferian religion. It's not
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:05.640]  Judaism as practiced in by, you know, a lot of people, obviously in Israel. It's it's
[2:03:05.640 --> 2:03:10.720]  a bastardized version that worships the dark sun. And that's why this group is bombing
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:19.400]  Israel with their sixth shot now to kill the Jews. Yeah, yeah, it really is all biblical.
[2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:25.520]  It's it's all it's all starting to make sense. Just frustrating that there's so little one
[2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:32.520]  man can do about it. And then of course, Ukraine is part of that geographically. Yeah, yeah,
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:36.320]  it's right in that part of the world. Yeah, there's a lot of wars have been going on,
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.760]  because that's the gateway of East versus West. So but it wasn't just that group stealing
[2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:43.960]  identities and doing all that. That's like been going on a long time. But yeah, it definitely
[2:03:43.960 --> 2:03:51.200]  happens. Muhammad was big on that he did that too. Sure. And they've recruited a lot of
[2:03:51.200 --> 2:03:57.440]  like minded people, as you say, over the centuries. And so now they've got, you know, rings and
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:04:02.480]  round rings of people who basically do their bidding. So it makes it it makes it hard to
[2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:06.800]  identify who really there's no doubt that group set up Hitler to see you can see that
[2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:12.520]  and they could destroy him. And then you see how that works. Right. Very sophisticated.
[2:04:12.520 --> 2:04:15.880]  Not sure where but though you can see right through it. God bless you, brother. Yeah,
[2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:19.600]  that's the whole history type shows. We should do more of those. Good to hear from Dr. Mike.
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:23.680]  All right. I couldn't get to all the calls. I tried. I told John take like 10. He took
[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.160]  like 20. We got to 17. So I apologize in three collars, but I went the order they received.
[2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:34.400]  But I hate not taking your calls. So we're doing special shows and weeknights and also
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:38.320]  the Saturday shows. But I'm not doing a Saturday show tomorrow. I'm taking my four year old
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.880]  daughter out to have some fun. I promised her last night. She said, Daddy, I want to
[2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:49.240]  play with you. I want you to stay with me. I just said, yes, ma'am, we'll be right back.
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:58.360]  Stay with us.
[2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:04.360]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of
[2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:10.960]  2021 and sold out in 10 days. Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into
[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:17.600]  April 2022 is now being offered. I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[2:05:17.600 --> 2:05:22.160]  because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom
[2:05:22.160 --> 2:05:27.720]  and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants. So go for yourself
[2:05:27.720 --> 2:05:35.920]  to 1776 coin.com and see the new Liberty tree coin. It is powerful. Witness this powerful
[2:05:35.920 --> 2:05:42.160]  iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part of the founding member
[2:05:42.160 --> 2:05:48.360]  system that we're set to launch in the very near future. Thanks to your support of this

[1:49:37.580 --> 2:06:46.140]  but she said the flu for 14 days. Should she get a flu shot? Well, no, if she
[2:06:46.140 --> 2:06:50.760]  got the flu for 14 days, she's this protected as anybody can be because the best vaccination
[2:06:50.760 --> 2:06:58.760]  is to get infected yourself. And if she really has the flu, if she really has the flu, she
[2:06:58.760 --> 2:07:03.640]  definitely doesn't need a flu vaccine. If she really has the flu, she should not get
[2:07:03.640 --> 2:07:07.880]  it again. She doesn't need it because it's the best. It's the most potent vaccination
[2:07:07.880 --> 2:07:22.480]  is getting infected yourself. The young men and women who have volunteered to serve and
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:25.440]  protect their communities as members of the United States military have been under attack
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:31.600]  by their own government for over a century, experimented on like laboratory animals with
[2:07:31.600 --> 2:07:39.680]  mustard gas, plutonium, agent orange and depleted uranium. But what we are experiencing now
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:45.600]  is the final destruction of the entire US military from within. Those with enough sense
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:51.600]  to refuse the gene therapy shots are being forced out of military service. Navy SEALs
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:57.360]  who refuse the jab have been denied deployment and even denied permission to travel for medical
[2:07:57.360 --> 2:08:03.240]  treatment. But more than two thirds of the entire US military have chosen to receive
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:10.720]  this life altering vaccine, which has now proven to be catastrophic. Attorney at law
[2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:17.000]  Todd Callender, who is representing the US Navy SEALs versus President Joe Biden has recently
[2:08:17.000 --> 2:08:26.080]  reported an 1100% increase in US military deaths as a result of these mRNA injections.
[2:08:26.080 --> 2:08:33.680]  Based on their latest data, they expect this number to soon rise above 5000%. Elite military
[2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:39.160]  database from the Department of Defense shows us that while the public was being told that
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:46.200]  it's a crisis of the unvaccinated, the defense secretary in upper command knew 71% of all
[2:08:46.200 --> 2:08:52.080]  new cases were among the fully vaccinated. The Department of Defense knew what they were
[2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:57.840]  doing and the proper charges are genocide. If you look at all of the documentation, Pfizer's
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:03.200]  documentation, we did mass spectrometry on their vials. We know what's in these things
[2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:09.160]  and in fact they even admit that they added an HIV protein into the shots for the purpose
[2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:14.640]  of disabling people's autoimmune. They couldn't slip these lipanato particles, which are in
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:21.960]  fact little bombers that carry pathogenic proteins to effectuate gene modification in
[2:09:21.960 --> 2:09:26.760]  an individual. Gene therapies, they call it. In order to get those lipanato particles past
[2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:31.960]  your cell unit defense, your body's defense, they had to disarm your immune system and
[2:09:31.960 --> 2:09:35.640]  they did that. It's in all the scientific papers and what they didn't do is undo that
[2:09:35.640 --> 2:09:40.120]  and right now they're coming to understand this. People are showing up HIV positive.
[2:09:40.120 --> 2:09:44.360]  People with three shots have no immune system left over whatsoever. There is no other way
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:48.840]  to characterize this other than intentional homicide, the unlawful taking of the human
[2:09:48.840 --> 2:09:54.720]  life, except that it's in large numbers, which makes it a genocide. A vaccine delivered
[2:09:54.720 --> 2:10:01.200]  AIDS epidemic. That's right. That's correct. Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Ries.
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:14.200]  U.S. military deaths up 1100% and exponentially rising. Band-odd video, share it, save lives,
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:20.200]  now folks, we're all under attack. We're all together. All right. Two years ago, Roger
[2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:24.880]  Stone said, you've got to talk to the folks at Big Daddy Unlimited and I looked them
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:28.920]  up and they were one of the, you know, biggest up-and-coming gun stores down the eighth biggest
[2:10:28.920 --> 2:10:32.520]  in the United States out of tens of thousands. That's a big deal. Then I saw their training
[2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:35.960]  videos and saw the big events they had for veterans. I really loved it. Then I saw the
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:42.080]  great deals they had on guns. I wanted to get them here today to talk about all that
[2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:47.800]  and more and just the craziness that is unfolding. But when you see Roger Stone's website or
[2:10:47.800 --> 2:10:53.240]  Roger Stone email to be online, these folks were literally stepped up and helped run his
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:57.320]  website and everything Roger Stone does. So behind the scenes, not just there, but so
[2:10:57.320 --> 2:11:02.640]  many places, they're filling that vacuum that even InfoWars can't afford to do. So it's
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:07.800]  very, very exciting. So Tony McKnight's here with his lovely wife, Sherry McKnight. They
[2:11:07.800 --> 2:11:12.680]  are the co-owners of Big Daddy Unlimited and that is, of course, you go to infowarsguns.com
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:17.040]  because they are a sponsor with us and we love them. If you go to infowarsguns.com, it's
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:22.080]  the whole site, they're a whole great system. Then we get obviously support here for the
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:25.480]  show. So it's a win-win. A lot of guns that are sold out. They have, because they're a
[2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:32.680]  big buyer, a lot of ammo that's sold out. They have infowarsguns.com. So Tony and Sherry,
[2:11:32.680 --> 2:11:36.440]  we've got the rest of the hour. So we've got about 50 minutes here, but we're going to
[2:11:36.440 --> 2:11:39.960]  break here in just a few. But I want to go through everything and some of the amazing
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:44.000]  things you guys are doing, because how did you guys just start in the last, you know,
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:48.480]  I don't know, six, seven years and then just explode to be one of the biggest gun companies
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:51.000]  in the U.S.?
[2:11:51.000 --> 2:11:57.280]  Well, you know, things were going on in the country and for the first time, I started
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:12:03.160]  paying attention. And what I noticed was the term gun control. And when I heard the term
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:08.720]  gun control, it made me really nervous because I said, no, I don't like control. And when
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:12.940]  it pertained to the Second Amendment, even though I wasn't exercising my Second Amendment
[2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:18.760]  rights at that time, I knew that I had them. And I knew that I possessed them and I did
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:23.200]  not want to hear that they were going to be taken away from me. So right at that moment,
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:27.520]  I literally sprung up out of my chair, ran to the garage, because that's where our business
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:31.120]  was at the time. It was a health products business. And I said, Tony, these people are
[2:12:31.120 --> 2:12:35.440]  talking about taking our gun rights. We have to go get a gun. We have to go buy guns.
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:38.120]  And I learned about your story a few years ago. That's what's beautiful is you weren't
[2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:43.160]  gun nuts. You weren't obsessed with it, but you instinctively saw there was an attack.
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:46.800]  And so a lot of other folks that are gun experts have tried to be successful and haven't been.
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:51.560]  Why have novices been so successful and now having the eighth largest gun shop in the U.S.?
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:57.120]  Well, first I want to say passion. Tony and I do exactly what we believe in and we don't
[2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:03.840]  do stuff that we don't believe in. Freedom is our essential, um, most important thing
[2:13:03.840 --> 2:13:08.400]  in our life. And so when we see something or something under attack, we want to rise
[2:13:08.400 --> 2:13:12.080]  up immediately and do something about it. Was it a group of things or was that final
[2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:18.520]  thing you saw? What made you just go, Hey, we got to promote this? Um, well, lots of,
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:24.880]  um, tragic events happen and people want to immediately go to gun control. And the only
[2:13:24.880 --> 2:13:31.120]  person that that works, you know, for in gun control is the bad guys. And, uh, so you just
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:36.040]  instinctively got, why am I being penalized for what somebody else did? I better go exercise
[2:13:36.040 --> 2:13:40.720]  us. Right. 100%. Exactly. So it was just them coming out in the last five, six years
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:44.560]  saying we want to take the guns was you were finally like, Whoa, this is real. Basically,
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:49.360]  what happened was we were not plugged in. We really didn't pay attention to what was
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:55.280]  going on in the world, especially in America. And then when this happened, uh, we were just
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:14:00.840]  starting to wake up and get in touch with, you know, America's under attack from all
[2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:07.320]  different, uh, corners. And for us, the second amendment was a big thing that we never thought
[2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:11.560]  anything about. But once somebody said they were going to take it away, it became very
[2:14:11.560 --> 2:14:15.640]  important to us. Um, we never believe that people shouldn't have guns. We believe we're
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:21.800]  constitutional conservatives constitution. I believe we believe is still a very valid
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:26.400]  document. I don't think it's changed in the last 200 plus years. Uh, but you don't know
[2:14:26.400 --> 2:14:30.840]  what you got until it's gone. It was that final moment. Exactly right. And that really
[2:14:30.840 --> 2:14:36.920]  activated us. And then what solidified it was once we got the gun bug and we got into
[2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:42.880]  the firearms business, we realized right away, it's politics and you're on one side or the
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:48.440]  other. And we were all in for America. And for us, it was a great way to exercise our
[2:14:48.440 --> 2:14:54.360]  God given rights and also to create a fantastic business that lets us talk to a lot of people
[2:14:54.360 --> 2:14:58.440]  about those rights. Well, that's what I found with so many just common hardworking Americans
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.840]  that are a political, they realize America's in trouble. They're like a fish finally put
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:07.640]  in water. Once you get in it, you're like, boom. Yeah, we don't do anything halfway.
[2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:13.240]  And when we do something, we're all in. Yes, folks go to info wars guns.com if they want

[2:15:40.600 --> 2:15:44.520]  everything. Yeah. It was one of the most interesting things that I found when I got

[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:02.920]  The Genesis over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed
[2:18:02.920 --> 2:18:08.720]  major universities. They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:13.600]  of New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[2:18:13.600 --> 2:18:19.760]  and must be ended. And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:24.000]  women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is
[2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:29.280]  a bad thing. And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national
[2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:32.640]  daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times. But I like to make it as well. I love to make
[2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:37.520]  breakfast. And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:42.640]  and be nurtured kids and then all sit down together and have that communal event. And
[2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:48.560]  that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions and coming
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:54.640]  together. They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth when we domesticate us and turn
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:19:01.440]  us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue. The powerful combination of both vitamin C and
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:06.720]  zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. InfoWars has made it easier
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:11.120]  to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:16.400]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[2:19:16.400 --> 2:19:21.440]  from the InfoWars store. The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:27.280]  below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals found in the hips
[2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:32.480]  may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:37.840]  and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[2:19:37.840 --> 2:19:42.560]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense,
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:47.440]  and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported that intake of both is often
[2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:52.400]  inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit,
[2:19:52.400 --> 2:20:16.320]  be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:21.760]  Okay, so these folks are awesome. They helped so many great patriots in Florida and around the
[2:20:21.760 --> 2:20:26.400]  country like Roger Stone, Conan McKnight and Sherry McKnight, Big Daddy Unlimited Firearms,
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:31.200]  InfoWarsGuns.com. Take sure their main site, but they know you're coming from us, so it supports
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:36.240]  everybody at 361. And you guys are like, Hey, we want to get into politics. They're coming for our
[2:20:36.240 --> 2:20:43.040]  guns. And I'm like, Hey, let's talk about though. Now you guys, in such a short period of time,
[2:20:43.040 --> 2:20:49.040]  five, six years or whatever, have become the eighth biggest gun dealer or gun shop in the US out of
[2:20:49.040 --> 2:20:54.000]  over 10,000. I know there are. That is a big deal. And talk about some of the stuff that's at infowars
[2:20:54.000 --> 2:20:58.560]  guns.com and how people become a member. They get discounts, everything else, because we're not
[2:20:58.560 --> 2:21:02.320]  going to get to that if we don't. And you guys are doing a lot of exciting stuff. Our listeners
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:08.320]  want to know about it. So tell people from, from just plain Jane guns, great prices to super fancy
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:14.160]  ones, you guys have got the full spectrum over 8,000 guns. Then as you said, all the accessories,
[2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:18.400]  is there really anybody out there? I was looking at your catalog of in stock stuff ammo ready to
[2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:23.440]  ship. Most folks are out of it. You guys have, I guess, done a good job of stockpiling or hoarding
[2:21:23.440 --> 2:21:28.960]  or how do you guys have all these guns and ammo and stock others? No, that's not stockpiling and
[2:21:28.960 --> 2:21:33.920]  hoarding. We just have very good. I don't mean that as a bad word. We have very good relationships
[2:21:33.920 --> 2:21:39.120]  with the manufacturers and the vendors in the industry. And because of the nature of the industry,
[2:21:39.120 --> 2:21:45.200]  unfortunately, the big get bigger and the small get kind of pushed out. But we did that because
[2:21:45.200 --> 2:21:49.440]  when we got into it, like we said, we don't do anything halfway. And at the end of the day,
[2:21:49.440 --> 2:21:56.800]  everything really is all about the members. It's all about giving them value. We wanted to put
[2:21:56.800 --> 2:22:02.800]  together a platform and a business for people to treat them the way we wanted to be treated when
[2:22:02.800 --> 2:22:08.160]  we got involved in the firearms industry. We fell in love with firearms. We fell in love with the
[2:22:08.160 --> 2:22:13.760]  whole genre. And we wanted to give people products at prices that they could live with.
[2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:20.480]  So tell people what's going to happen when they go to M4WarsGuns.com, but you get us just a link to
[2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:24.560]  big data distributors. Correct. But also we're doing a giveaway for M4Wars.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:31.840]  You've got a one of a kind M4Wars gun. It's free to sign up for it. And it is a one of a kind
[2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:38.560]  custom built in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It's made out of 70, 50 aluminum. It's a really...
[2:22:38.560 --> 2:22:42.000]  Oh, you brought it. In fact, if it's in there, we can bring it out. Oh, like, wait, it's amazing.
[2:22:42.000 --> 2:22:46.000]  It's a really high end custom gun. It was made in North Texas.
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:52.080]  As a gentleman told us the other day, we're sick and tired of being Texas's little brother.
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:22:55.920]  No, it's a joke. It used to be part of Texas, part of it. So it's a joke. It's North Texas. But
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:03.760]  yeah, we love Oklahoma. Hell, we're Southern Oklahoma. Anyway, sorry, go ahead. Oh, sorry.
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:08.160]  I'm ranting here. You're great. You're great. So anyway, we put this all together to basically
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:14.080]  give people what they wanted and try to give them as much access as possible. And then basically
[2:23:14.080 --> 2:23:18.720]  what we've been doing over the last year is trying to pack more value into the membership.
[2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:24.880]  So tell us about the membership. If you go to infowarsguns.com and you see the gun there to
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:29.520]  get in the raffle, what do people do? And then what's the benefit of signing up with you guys?
[2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:35.120]  So the benefit is that you're going to get big discounts on pretty much everything that we have.
[2:23:35.120 --> 2:23:42.160]  We are also running a special for infowars where you get a substantial discount to yearly membership,

[2:24:00.320 --> 2:24:07.360]  you. And you guys also have some of the best gun insurance out there, right? We have a 2a benefits
[2:24:07.360 --> 2:24:15.360]  package that we put together. It gives you up to $100,000 of accidental death and firearms insurance.
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:20.800]  And we are expanding that benefit. We're looking for partners to help us expand that benefit for
[2:24:20.800 --> 2:24:26.080]  our members. And you've got a lot of fancy cutting edge stuff that's still legal, but who knows how
[2:24:26.080 --> 2:24:32.160]  long. 100%. There's a lot of exclusive stuff for Big Daddy Unlimited members. And we have just
[2:24:32.160 --> 2:24:38.800]  over the last year recently got into manufacturing. So our big focus is our manufacturing members and
[2:24:38.800 --> 2:24:44.320]  retail store expansion. Tell us more about it. There's a lot of cool stuff here. Well, the next
[2:24:44.320 --> 2:24:48.400]  big thing that we started doing was we started with one gun shop. That's how we got into the
[2:24:48.400 --> 2:24:55.040]  industry. We created Big Daddy Unlimited, which is our membership platform. And over the last
[2:24:55.040 --> 2:25:00.720]  two years, we've launched four more stores and we got 21 more coming this year. And then another
[2:25:00.720 --> 2:25:06.560]  25 coming next year. Well, that right there is an amazing success story. You're right. It takes
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:12.960]  scalability and getting big to be able to give people discounts. Not only that, but it's also a
[2:25:12.960 --> 2:25:20.400]  way for us to have an impact on the industry and also put us in a position to have some influence
[2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:26.400]  in terms of the political aspects of the industry. And I guess how'd you guys get big so fast,
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:32.240]  just the passion and everything? Yeah, I mean, we obviously there's been a little bit of luck
[2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:37.600]  involved, but it really is all about there was an opportunity. We saw it. We really ran after it
[2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:43.280]  and we're in 110%. We're all in the two of us work together in the office pretty much 12,
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:48.720]  14 hours a day, six days a week. We take a day off on the weekends, but then we're right back at it.
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:52.880]  So folks go to infowordsguns.com. They just sign up for the raffle and they can
[2:25:53.520 --> 2:25:57.680]  then be part of getting this info wars exclusive gun. Absolutely.
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:02.000]  Sherry, you've been chomping at the bit, though, to get into like how you got involved, just where
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:08.640]  we are. Well, I think what is very unique about our story is that, you know, like I said, we were
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:13.120]  in the health products business. We weren't paying attention to what was going on. And the minute
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:18.240]  that we did start paying attention, it was like, holy cow, it's places that, you know, going nuts.
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:24.400]  And so with that, that immediately ignited my fire. So I started attending, you know,
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:29.760]  some meetings and getting involved in the local political scene and learning more and more and
[2:26:29.760 --> 2:26:34.720]  more meeting lots of great people. Meanwhile, Tony and I were going to all the gun shows that we
[2:26:34.720 --> 2:26:40.080]  could possibly find within a couple of hour radius. And we started just meeting people and just
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:46.720]  getting immersed basically into the second amendment community and just kind of falling in love with
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:51.200]  what we found. You know, it was very patriotic people. That was fitting in with what we were doing.
[2:26:52.240 --> 2:26:56.720]  You know, originally got involved in tea party meetings and, you know, just meeting people
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:27:01.120]  and learning the landscape of what was going on in our country. And the more we learned,
[2:27:01.120 --> 2:27:07.760]  the more passionate that we got. And eventually that led to and when Tony says we do stuff all in,
[2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:12.480]  we do. So we work, work, work. And then we were passionately at night, attending things that
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:17.600]  we thought were going to get us, you know, not only more involved, but more educated so we could,
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:22.560]  you know, basically be more, do more, have more. And what we really wanted more of was freedom.
[2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.880]  So that is what we have done. And so, you know, we've done a lot of things locally from working
[2:27:28.880 --> 2:27:34.320]  with the Trump campaign during 2016 to, you know, actually getting involved and becoming,
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:40.080]  first we joined our local Republican party. Then eventually I became the state committee woman.
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:45.760]  And a couple of years later, Tony became the chair of the party and we just kept growing from there.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:51.280]  And that's what scares the system is normal people waking up and getting involved.
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:56.320]  That's why they're trying to show everything now because so many normal folks are now getting
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:01.200]  involved and overriding their attempt to take over. Yes. Absolutely. And that's what it's all about.
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:07.120]  You know, at our company, I have a lot of sayings and I share them with everybody,
[2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:11.680]  but one of them is you got to show up to go up and, you know, we show show up for
[2:28:11.680 --> 2:28:16.800]  everything that we believe is important. And then that just overflows into everything we're doing.
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:21.680]  And if you, you know, people can sit at home and talk about what's going on, or they can,
[2:28:21.680 --> 2:28:26.160]  you know, be keyboard warriors and attack those who are doing things. But the most
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:30.400]  important thing you can do is be the change that you wish to see. And that's what Tony and I did.
[2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:34.320]  We didn't like what we saw. So we showed up and we started doing things that, you know, we felt
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:38.080]  would move. And that's why they did the global lockdowns and things they admitted was to shut
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:43.040]  down the populist movement. We have, we have top ministers in Canada saying we had to shut
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:28:47.200]  things down because they're all against us. They're talking their meeting. And it's the
[2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:50.960]  first amendment, the second amendment, all the 10th amendment, all of it is so beautiful.
[2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:54.720]  Go to infowarsguns.com. Some of the free raffle will be right back. Stay with us.
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:29:04.400]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder's series at 1776coin.com
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:09.760]  or infowarsstore.com. And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty. Thomas Jefferson quote,
[2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:13.840]  must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It's a coin I designed. I'm very,
[2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:19.040]  very proud of it. And it will end up being a collectible. I know that the first coin is
[2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:24.800]  already selling on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it. We need to sell
[2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:30.080]  all 10,000 of these very, very quickly. And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them
[2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:34.400]  now. I'd like to move them out very quickly. I think they will sell out probably in five or
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:40.720]  six more days. And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[2:29:40.720 --> 2:29:43.840]  We've had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems. So it was a limited edition,
[2:29:43.840 --> 2:29:47.760]  collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom. And it's needed for our
[2:29:47.760 --> 2:29:52.800]  infrastructure and building new systems. So please give yourself and us aid in the fight
[2:29:52.800 --> 2:29:59.840]  against the new order at 1776coin.com. The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were
[2:29:59.840 --> 2:30:06.880]  adopted in 1791. The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[2:30:06.880 --> 2:30:13.440]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship interference and

[2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:43.920]  and my friends will attest to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70,
[2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:55.120]  I mean, I know I'm not just blowing smoke here. The B12 saves my life.

[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:33.600]  Tony and Sherry McKnight are here with us. They're the founders and owners of Big Daddy Unlimited
[2:33:33.600 --> 2:33:40.720]  Firearms. We've got a link that supports InfoWars, infowarsguns.com. Go there and become a member
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:46.320]  and get big discounts on thousands and thousands of items. Very, very exciting. But, but look,
[2:33:46.320 --> 2:33:50.480]  you guys are the experts on this. I've got a hundred questions, but where should we go next
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:56.560]  here with Tony and with Sherry? Pick a topic. There's so many. I mean, there's so many to get to.
[2:33:56.560 --> 2:34:03.200]  Let's talk more about why people should go become members and how they do that at Big Daddy Unlimited.
[2:34:05.280 --> 2:34:10.400]  I'll tell you why I think people should come and become members. Our whole goal is to rationalize
[2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:16.720]  the entire firearms buying process. We want to make it easier and more affordable for people to
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:21.120]  exercise their Second Amendment. And so when we first started and we launched with the online
[2:34:21.120 --> 2:34:26.240]  e-commerce platform, that was great. We got a lot of people who are supporting us and supporting
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:32.000]  what we're doing. But at the end of the day, we wanted to be able to be front and center with
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:37.920]  the folks and teach them how they could access firearms, not only the firearms themselves,
[2:34:37.920 --> 2:34:43.520]  but training and education about how to use the firearm. And so that was the whole idea
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:48.320]  behind the retail expansion. And our goal is to take it one step farther than most of your
[2:34:48.320 --> 2:34:53.440]  traditional firearms retailers. We want Big Daddy Guns, which is our retail chain,
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:58.320]  to be front and center. Think Starbucks right next to it's a Big Daddy Guns. Basically,
[2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:02.880]  where people actually go to shop, we want them to. And that's how we culturally win is not making
[2:35:02.880 --> 2:35:10.720]  guns dirty like it's the porno shop. It's exactly right. Think the apple of guns. Exactly. We didn't
[2:35:10.720 --> 2:35:16.320]  make it mainline like we're the dominant culture. That's right. Exactly. Well, one of the, you know,
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:20.240]  when we first got started and started going into the gun stores and stuff, what we found is
[2:35:20.240 --> 2:35:25.040]  they weren't very receptive. Well, there's an elitism. We're the real gun experts over here.
[2:35:25.040 --> 2:35:31.280]  And we came in, you know, go figure, we came in actually looking for advice. We wanted to know,
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:37.120]  you know, what was a good gun to buy? We had questions. And, you know, it's generally filled
[2:35:37.120 --> 2:35:42.960]  with people that, you know, aren't that helpful because if you don't have all the right lingo or
[2:35:42.960 --> 2:35:48.480]  all the right knowledge, they don't consider you like a great customer. There's an elitism to it,
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:53.600]  which really hurts the movement. And stores are often, you know, sort of dark, dingy, you know,
[2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:58.640]  I call them dark, dingy, musty, dusty. They're like man caves. Yes. And so I could feel that right
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:04.480]  when I went in because I had not been shopping in gun stores. So right away when we, when he looked
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:08.800]  over at me and said, do you want to start a gun? Apple's the model all white and glistening and
[2:36:08.800 --> 2:36:14.560]  like, that's exactly what we're doing. Although we do have a lot of orange. Yeah. Well, we have
[2:36:14.560 --> 2:36:19.680]  a orange top. I like orange. Yeah. Yeah. Orange, white and gray. Yes. But so we wanted our shop
[2:36:19.680 --> 2:36:25.200]  to be like that. Bright and cheery and chipper customer service is king for us. The opposite of
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:30.320]  my office is like a black hole. Yes, it's very dark in here, but it's also great. So the light shines
[2:36:30.320 --> 2:36:35.920]  though. Yeah. And this sets amazing. But yeah, we wanted to do something different with the industry.
[2:36:35.920 --> 2:36:41.840]  We wanted to make it a friendly place that you would go into. And we want our staff to receive
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:46.800]  everybody, you know, as not only just someone that's there to buy a gun, but we have an opportunity
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:51.440]  with so many of the new gun owners over the last year that are coming in that don't know what to
[2:36:51.440 --> 2:36:56.720]  do just like I didn't know a few years ago. But we want to, you know, sort of love them into the
[2:36:56.720 --> 2:37:01.360]  Second Amendment and really help them exercise their Second Amendment rights and become passionate
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:06.000]  because it's that passion that's driven us. And we also believe that's what America was founded on.
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:10.720]  So we really want to be a part of educating, motivating and activating the American people.
[2:37:10.720 --> 2:37:14.880]  I agree. It should be like when there's a hurricane and people are going to the Red Cross,
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:18.640]  you give them the blanket in the care package. It's like, oh, you're going to defend yourself now.
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:26.320]  So that's that's you get one of your secret is scaling up great product, great service,
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:32.160]  great quality and making it where it's not intimidating. Yes. 100%. And making it mainstream,
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:36.080]  that's Tony's main goal is making it very mainstream. So it's like, all right, if you're
[2:37:36.080 --> 2:37:40.000]  going to go to Home Depot and maybe I'm stopping over at Big Daddy Guns as well, you know, we're
[2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:44.400]  right there. You don't have to go, you know, to some random area of town. And imagine that Big
[2:37:44.400 --> 2:37:47.680]  Daddy was on every corner, we wouldn't have all this crime. Well, if you look at the maps,
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:52.640]  places with guns, no crime everywhere else, hell on earth. I mean, my goodness, because gun control
[2:37:52.640 --> 2:37:56.480]  is a very dangerous. I bet the defunding of the police is we got you guys a lot of business. Good
[2:37:56.480 --> 2:38:01.120]  Lord, it's dangerous. Well, that's where I think that, you know, the Second Amendment really came
[2:38:01.120 --> 2:38:06.560]  into everyone's awareness is like, you know, businesses were being burned down, stores were
[2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:13.360]  being robbed. It was a very dangerous place in the early part of the pandemic. And it scared a lot
[2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:17.840]  of people. And then you realize, geez, how am I going to defend myself? And then I know a lot
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:21.440]  of people have been mugged and robbed in Austin. So it's not high. The crime is out of control.
[2:38:21.440 --> 2:38:25.200]  Crime is out of the out of control. I'm trying to move out of the city because of it. If you don't
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:29.040]  have a way to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Just be a target and be okay with that?
[2:38:29.840 --> 2:38:34.000]  Exactly. I'm not okay with that. And again, we're not not wanting to kill anybody. No,
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:37.440]  he wants to trouble, but we want to defend ourselves. I like how you guys are doing shooting
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:43.520]  events, videos. You guys are like a one stop shop. Yes, we have a great marketing department.
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:48.640]  We love putting on events. We love working with great influencers and just, you know,
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:54.960]  doing whatever we can to get the message out. So what do people do, Tony, when they go to
[2:38:54.960 --> 2:39:00.800]  infowarsguns.com? Because you got great prices. You got stuff in stock. You got great service.
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:05.600]  It's a 360 win. I guess you can ship guns. Once you do the background thing with the gun shop,
[2:39:05.600 --> 2:39:09.680]  there they do the, or the check there. Tell me about all the services you guys have.
[2:39:09.680 --> 2:39:14.960]  Well, the first thing they need to do when they go to infowarsguns.com is sign up to win that free
[2:39:14.960 --> 2:39:22.480]  cool info wars exclusive rifle that we've built for it. It says the answer in 1984, 1776. There you
[2:39:22.480 --> 2:39:29.680]  go. That info wars manned out video on it. That's awesome. Once they do that, sign up, then become
[2:39:29.680 --> 2:39:34.880]  a member. And then what we'll start doing was we'll walk you through the process of what's available.
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:38.880]  But like I said, the biggest thing you can do is call the toll free number, talk to some of our
[2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:43.280]  knowledgeable customer service people. One of the things that we did that was very different
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:48.640]  than everybody else is there's no scripts. One of the first things we told our staff was, look,
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:56.080]  we don't need BS. Treat our members the way you would want to be treated. Don't give them some
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:01.520]  corporate line about the excuse of why something went wrong or why something went right. Just
[2:40:01.520 --> 2:40:06.880]  tell them, Hey, if we screwed up, we screwed up on it. You know, and that's really what's given us
[2:40:06.880 --> 2:40:11.840]  such a core impassioned group of members. There's a lot of them places if it's jamming or well,
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:16.400]  this guy doesn't normally do that. What's the, you know, yeah, true. Like, okay, it's jamming.
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:23.040]  Yeah, we have a lot of use the wrong ammo. Right, right. Yeah. And they're like, let's see.
[2:40:23.040 --> 2:40:30.880]  Exactly. And talk to people that talk to your members and our customers the way you would
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.720]  want to be talked to. Hey, if you have a problem, let me try to walk you through it or let me try
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:39.680]  to figure out what's really going wrong. And can I solve that for you? I mean, one of the first
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:45.360]  things we did in our stores, what the whole idea was, Hey, if we don't have it, we'll get it for
[2:40:45.360 --> 2:40:50.880]  you. Let me know what you're looking for. Not let me try to sell you this thing that you might not
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:58.640]  really want. Yeah, I'm sold on that. Yeah. One of the things that we came up with that when I first
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:03.200]  started working in our customer service department, because I love customer service. And I love our
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:07.440]  members is I know you want to get the pulse of what are the members thinking. But I came up with
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:13.120]  a couple of key principles that we run the business on in the first one is members first,
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:18.000]  because members is what our business is all about. So every decision that we make needs to run through
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:22.560]  the funnel of members first. Is it going to be good for the members? How can we make it good
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:28.240]  for the members? So, um, yeah, we don't do scripts and things like that. We really we're real people
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:32.480]  helping real people. And then we work with teamwork, you know, teamwork makes the most customers
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:39.600]  always right. Well, yes, yes, we know that from a business perspective. You have to find a way
[2:41:39.600 --> 2:41:44.480]  to help that member get what they want. That's what they are there to do. And that's what capitalism
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:49.920]  is is all these choices. We figure out what the best thing is. That's exactly right. And so teamwork
[2:41:49.920 --> 2:41:57.040]  is stressed at our company, as well as something that I call the spirit of excellence. And we
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:02.400]  actually even have a spirit of excellence award that we give out quarterly, we've just actually
[2:42:03.280 --> 2:42:08.480]  given out our first one along with this year, creating the employee of the month as well. So
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:13.280]  of course, we've had three of those. But these are the things that we really love about Big Daddy
[2:42:13.280 --> 2:42:19.840]  Unlimited is our amazing team. And just creating a family environment, our culture is really what
[2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:24.720]  sets us apart. And what you're doing is what they fear. You're helping talk show us your energizing
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:29.040]  community, you're sponsoring all over the country, you become the eighth largest gun seller in the
[2:42:29.040 --> 2:42:34.000]  in the US gun shop. That is, and that is such as and then a lot of the establishment people
[2:42:34.000 --> 2:42:38.480]  in around 100 years are like, Well, who are these people? That's what America is is innovation.
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:43.440]  That's right. That's right. And that's what the establishment fears. Oh, I mean, I'm not trying
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:48.000]  to brag myself that like, three years into being on air, I was like, already going up against Limbaugh
[2:42:48.000 --> 2:42:52.560]  and like, people are like, who is this dude? It's like 25 and about to take over. He's not supposed
[2:42:52.560 --> 2:42:56.240]  to do that. Well, that's what innovation is about. Yeah, you just put your you put your
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:03.920]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of 2021
[2:43:03.920 --> 2:43:11.840]  and sold out in 10 days. Now, the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April, 2022
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:17.040]  is now being offered. And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again, because these are
[2:43:17.040 --> 2:43:22.160]  historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:28.960]  the front lines of the fight against these tyrants. So go for yourself to 1776 coin.com
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:36.240]  and see the new Liberty tree coin. It is powerful. Witness this powerful iconography for
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:42.480]  yourself and have this piece of history and be part of the founding member system that we're
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:49.040]  set to launch in the very near future. Thanks to your support of this project, get a historic
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:44:00.000]  memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776 coin.com.
[2:44:01.200 --> 2:44:04.880]  Granny do right. Granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the air. Go ahead.
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:10.480]  Challenge. First of all, let me say I love your products. I am a granny and for all the
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:15.280]  senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:20.960]  with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called. But since taking your x2 for the last
[2:44:20.960 --> 2:44:26.560]  couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous. Actually, people think I'm 55 years old.
[2:44:27.760 --> 2:44:32.480]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's what
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:37.120]  I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation. But when I started taking it,
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.480]  I mean, it doesn't happen immediately. But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:46.880]  okay, you know, this is the ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:54.080]  have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has
[2:44:54.080 --> 2:45:04.880]  totally cleared up my skin. If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind
[2:45:04.880 --> 2:45:13.600]  control, the asleep France that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people
[2:45:13.600 --> 2:45:20.000]  are lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare. You're in a car and you get
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:28.320]  knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a
[2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:33.520]  concussion and that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us. They have put us
[2:45:33.520 --> 2:45:37.920]  into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave
[2:45:37.920 --> 2:45:42.960]  speech. He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture
[2:45:42.960 --> 2:45:48.560]  in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:53.200]  over the edge of the cliff. That's what their great reset is. They need darkness to thrive.
[2:45:53.200 --> 2:45:59.760]  The light lives at info wars.com. You know, it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it. It's
[2:45:59.760 --> 2:46:08.640]  just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty as the logo of
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:16.320]  human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program. And man, our work is
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:22.160]  really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done. So I'm asking
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:28.720]  listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info wars.com and we are
[2:46:28.720 --> 2:46:34.400]  funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support more than ever because
[2:46:34.400 --> 2:46:41.520]  this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at info wars.com. We've got 25 to 75%
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:46.480]  off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a long time like info wars life,
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:52.240]  fizzy magnesium mix that's so amazing and our new immune support formula that's so critical.
[2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:57.040]  They're all available 25 to 75% off at info wars.com right now.
[2:46:57.040 --> 2:47:04.400]  Now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:17.440]  Praise the Lord to test the ammunition. Praise the Lord to test the ammunition.
[2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:22.720]  Praise the Lord to test the ammunition and the Lord's name.
[2:47:22.720 --> 2:47:25.920]  Man, I don't know where the first five in this but it sounds basic.
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:34.560]  The night team is 42. What is this called? You guys are playing. Praise the Lord and
[2:47:34.560 --> 2:47:37.680]  pass the ammunition. This sounds even older than Hank Williams.
[2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:45.920]  Yep, sounds like fifties maybe. I think like thirties right when they got recording going.
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:52.720]  They have this like on a xylophone. All right, Tony McKnight and of course your great wife,

[2:48:20.320 --> 2:48:25.280]  promote the listeners. Getting a great deal. So what do people do at infowarsguns.com?

[2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:57.200]  that you can cash in for buying more stuff, gives you a VIP customer service access. Definitely
[2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:01.920]  take advantage of that because you definitely want to talk to somebody and have them find what
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:08.720]  you're looking for and we also have exclusive content that we promote, not only educational
[2:49:08.720 --> 2:49:15.840]  content having to do with firearms, but all kinds of other stuff and how are you to interrupt because
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:19.600]  I was checking, you know, weeks ago before you guys came to town because Roger's like, you
[2:49:19.600 --> 2:49:22.320]  got to get them. They're the best. I love them. That wouldn't be on air without them. Oh, they're
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:26.960]  wonderful. And I'm like, okay, let's do a deal. I'm looking at them. Everybody loves them. But
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:32.720]  how do you get ammo because you have so many calibers. Nobody's even got in stock. Sometimes
[2:49:32.720 --> 2:49:36.880]  stuff sold out, but compared to other people, even during the ammo shortage, you guys had ammo. How
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:43.440]  did you do that? Honestly, hard work and we basically fought our way into the top tiers of the
[2:49:43.440 --> 2:49:49.200]  firearms industry and we've got access and we've also got a really good group of people who are
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:56.640]  always looking for more. We want to always be the place for our members. We want our members to get
[2:49:56.640 --> 2:50:02.560]  the best and get it at a price that they can live with no matter what. Even throughout COVID, the
[2:50:02.560 --> 2:50:08.000]  COVID crisis, when the ammo prices were going through the roof, we didn't raise our prices.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:11.360]  Prices stayed the same. People couldn't believe it. They're like, why wouldn't you raise the prices
[2:50:11.360 --> 2:50:15.760]  and take advantage? Well, that's not the point of what we're doing. Do we want to make an extra
[2:50:15.760 --> 2:50:19.440]  dollar now and piss the people off and they leave us later? No, you'd rather be with 20 years with
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:24.000]  them and 100% freedom like you want to be treated. Like exactly. It's a chicken or egg thing, but
[2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:27.520]  it's like, it's just treat people like you want to be treated. Right. And then like we did a thing,
[2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:32.160]  our four year anniversary was two weeks ago. And what we did was we invited all the members,
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:37.680]  hey, come on by, come tour, come hang out, come see what's going on, come meet all the people,
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:43.760]  because at the end of the day, exactly what you said, we want them to be considered friends for
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:49.600]  years to come. Let's just say it. In the gun industry, on average, there's a very stuffy
[2:50:49.600 --> 2:50:54.720]  elitism about it. And I don't, I don't even know why that's there. Like you said, we need to make
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:51:01.760]  firearms as ubiquitous as Walmart. That's true. And that is our goal and our mission.
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:06.720]  They want to make it dirty. They want to make it weird. They want to make it like back of the road,
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:12.160]  like all, no, it needs to be training and open and then that ends the crime front and center,
[2:51:12.160 --> 2:51:20.320]  front and center. We want it to be as accessible as it is for people to be exposed to firearms,
[2:51:20.320 --> 2:51:26.640]  both through movie TVs, video games. We want them to have the ability to walk in to get their
[2:51:26.640 --> 2:51:32.640]  cup of coffee or get their tools at Home Depot and also walk into a Big Daddy Guns. And again,
[2:51:32.640 --> 2:51:38.320]  I could go buy a Ford F-150 and go run over 100 people tonight. It's not Ford's fault. It's not
[2:51:38.320 --> 2:51:42.800]  the dealership's fault. And the idea that gun owners are to blame for what crazy people do,
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:47.920]  no, the answer to crazy people is more good people with guns. And the statistics show like 20 plus
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:52.400]  times for every time a gun is used for a crime, it's used as a press crime. That's true. That's
[2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:58.560]  right. I can't imagine, you know, when we are in Florida, you know, we have the, you know,
[2:51:58.560 --> 2:52:03.840]  our concealed carry permits and stuff. And when you travel and you go into certain cities,
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:09.600]  D.C. or Chicago, like we have done, especially D.C. many times, you realize that very weird
[2:52:09.600 --> 2:52:15.520]  feeling of not, yeah, you feel naked. Like, what am I missing? Because you don't have the way to
[2:52:15.520 --> 2:52:19.600]  protect yourself. You don't know where you are, where you're going, what street you're walking
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:25.040]  down and you just realize that should something happen, you have no way to protect and defend
[2:52:25.040 --> 2:52:30.560]  yourself. I don't know how people feel comfortable with that. I mean. And in those cities and areas,
[2:52:30.560 --> 2:52:34.880]  you see the criminals are much more arrogant and cocky. Yes, because they can be, because
[2:52:35.600 --> 2:52:41.680]  if you cannot protect yourself, you are a target. Gun free zone, worst place to be.
[2:52:42.320 --> 2:52:47.360]  Infowarsguns.com, go there, sign up for the free raffle for the firearm or sign up to be a
[2:52:47.360 --> 2:52:53.840]  member of Big Daddy Unlimited. In the time we have left, you're going to go to the war room today.
[2:52:53.840 --> 2:52:57.840]  What else do you guys want to impart to the viewers and listeners? Well, I think what really sets
[2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:03.440]  us apart is our sales and service teams. We are there to really help our members. We actually
[2:53:03.440 --> 2:53:12.960]  answer the phones, email, live chat. We do focus on our members. We're a very, I think we're a
[2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:18.240]  very fun bunch of people. I mean, just imagine what it's like. Many people have had all kinds
[2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:24.240]  of constraints put on them during this last two years. But when you come to visit us or, you
[2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:28.720]  know, lots of people come to visit us, it's just such a free place to be, you know, we really
[2:53:28.720 --> 2:53:35.120]  exercise our right to be Americans there. And we did that all through the pandemic. So where's
[2:53:35.120 --> 2:53:39.520]  the mothership? It's in Florida. Yes, it's in Gainesville, Florida in Berkeley East. Yeah,
[2:53:39.520 --> 2:53:44.480]  we call it Berkeley East. It's, you know, we're in the blue dot in the sea of red. And we've built
[2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:50.960]  this pretty big gun business right there. And we're very excited about it. And we love to invite
[2:53:50.960 --> 2:53:56.640]  people down to come and check us out and really see the people that you're, that you're speaking
[2:53:56.640 --> 2:53:59.840]  to every day. Well, people ask me, why do you live in Austin? Well, my family's from here. I live
[2:53:59.840 --> 2:54:05.040]  here. But I'm literally living in like San Francisco, Texas. I heard that. But it's got to be exciting
[2:54:05.040 --> 2:54:10.000]  because Florida's getting more red, isn't it not? It's the only state getting more red, not more
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:15.280]  blue. Correct. I actually have more Republican registrations right now than Democrat. We have
[2:54:15.280 --> 2:54:20.880]  a lot of Florida is the model. Yes, great governor. Yes, he is man. He gets better and better. Yes,
[2:54:20.880 --> 2:54:25.040]  doubling down, not caring what they say. Yeah, screw Hollywood. That's what we need to hear
[2:54:25.040 --> 2:54:29.760]  more. He's already won the culture war. Let's act like it instead of cowering a fear to the laugh
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:35.280]  all day long. Yes, absolutely. And I love how he's really taking a stand and just really, he's
[2:54:35.280 --> 2:54:39.680]  really grown into the role. Yeah, you know, he's not afraid. He's not shy. He's like doing what
[2:54:39.680 --> 2:54:44.400]  he needs to do. He's actually doing what he said he would do. So and he's not fake about it. And
[2:54:44.400 --> 2:54:49.200]  the more they attack you, the stronger he gets. He's not, he gets better and better. Well, we got
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:54.880]  an opportunity to beat him a little bit. And honestly, what you see is what you get. Same
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:55:00.880]  dude. He's just gotten better at the being the governor part because he loves his children.
[2:55:00.880 --> 2:55:06.400]  He does. I mean, he loves America. And if you love your children, you better love the country you
[2:55:06.400 --> 2:55:12.080]  live in. Absolutely. People say, Oh, you're a dumb patriot. Well, this is my country and we're
[2:55:12.080 --> 2:55:16.960]  going to run it for our children. If you just get all you don't care, then the cloud swab comes in
[2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:21.840]  and takes over. Yes, he wants to tell us how we're going to run then that actually humans were not
[2:55:21.840 --> 2:55:26.560]  even actually going to be important for very much longer. So that's kind of bad news for us. Well,
[2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:31.600]  how about class swab and Bill Gates ain't going to be very important much longer? Absolutely.
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:37.120]  How about their obsolete? How about their non essential? Need more people going out there
[2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:42.960]  and supporting capitalism because the one thing that we've learned is in order to affect change
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:48.240]  kind of costs money. Yep. Well, that's another thing is again, any industry's got to have money
[2:55:48.240 --> 2:55:54.000]  and need scalability. And exactly we need major gun chains that are not cowardly like Dick Sporting
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:55:58.400]  does. We need we I mean, we need to go to a chain that's got the best prices, the best everything
[2:55:58.400 --> 2:56:03.040]  support mom and pop. That's great. But we need to be big with lobbyists. Well, and we need to do
[2:56:03.040 --> 2:56:07.360]  more stuff like this, more collaborative collaborative efforts with people who are
[2:56:08.320 --> 2:56:12.160]  interested in protecting America. But it's what you said when you first started on it was honor
[2:56:12.160 --> 2:56:17.680]  off. You said in the gun industry, big fish, big fish eat little fish. Well, the big get bigger
[2:56:17.680 --> 2:56:22.240]  and the small get squeezed out. It's an unfortunate. We're not against a little gun shop in small
[2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:27.120]  town. I go to those. The point is we need big organizations to fight these people. That's
[2:56:27.120 --> 2:56:30.880]  true. And it's absolutely true. And we want to partner with people, you know, we're not just
[2:56:30.880 --> 2:56:35.360]  like all, you know, that's one thing that's also different about Tony and I is we're not just the

[2:59:48.160 --> 2:59:54.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:03.600 --> 3:00:08.160]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and
[3:00:08.160 --> 3:00:13.920]  we want to return today to the global elite book series. It's been a while since I picked up an
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:20.640]  old text that I lectured on about five years ago and wow is it really important now? I mean it just
[3:00:20.640 --> 3:00:26.240]  like the news headlines of the last week make this book come alive and really demonstrate the
[3:00:26.240 --> 3:00:32.800]  thesis you know that we have here that that Alex has talked about for so long 20 plus years and
[3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:37.920]  the book is called the scientific outlook by Bertrand Russell, famous philosophers and logicians
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:45.920]  of the last say 200 300 years actually and Russell begins this book. No, remember this is written in
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:53.120]  1931 so this is not a treatise that was written 20 years ago 30 years ago almost 100 years ago
[3:00:53.920 --> 3:00:59.360]  and we're going to see that Bertrand Russell's outline for what the future scientific dictatorship
[3:00:59.360 --> 3:01:03.120]  will look like is the nightmare dystopia that they're trying to bring in now and what this
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:09.280]  demonstrates is that somebody at his level who was a worldly famous philosopher who
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:15.760]  basically sat at the front of this fake liberal organization the Fabian Socialist Society for
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:23.280]  a while it's true that he did leave the Fabian Socialist Society but he never changed his views
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:28.880]  about radical worldly depopulation right so the whole world needs to radically be depopulated
[3:01:28.880 --> 3:01:34.400]  and even though he left the Fabian Society and kept his liberal front this was always at the
[3:01:34.400 --> 3:01:40.800]  core of his so-called liberalism. Now he begins his book by I should mention the introduction
[3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:46.720]  written by a thinker by the name of David Papineau and Papineau says that if you want to understand
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:53.280]  Russell's book you need to go to Bernham's book the managerial revolution excuse me
[3:01:53.280 --> 3:01:59.920]  Bernham's book was actually part of a CIA funded research and study about how to
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:06.640]  essentially bring in a completely controlled technocratic society ruled by so-called experts
[3:02:06.640 --> 3:02:11.040]  and as you know in the middle of Quigley's book we found that amazing chapter in treasure and hope
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:16.880]  about how the future would be absolutely run by a technocratic managerial society and what this
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:22.160]  does is quantify everything and this is because Russell was a famous atheist materialist he
[3:02:22.160 --> 3:02:27.280]  thought that everything could be reduced to atoms in motion and so you could see that quantification
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:34.480]  making everything into basically mathematical domination ruled by numbers quantification
[3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:40.800]  and that's the rejection of the notion of free will was fundamental to Russell's thesis and if
[3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:46.720]  you remember this week we saw a transhumanist like Noah Yuval Harari the disciple of Klaus Schwab
[3:02:46.720 --> 3:02:51.440]  what did he say this week in that clip that went viral right there's men don't have free will you
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:58.160]  don't have a soul you have no there is no spirit in you well that's actually just echoing the philosophy
[3:02:58.160 --> 3:03:04.000]  of the real masters and engineers of this technocracy from 100 years ago Lord Bertrand Russell
[3:03:04.880 --> 3:03:09.280]  now Russell goes on to say that fundamental to his philosophy is to is that there's no free will
[3:03:09.840 --> 3:03:14.720]  and that there is no soul in man now remember Russell also says interesting contradictory
[3:03:14.720 --> 3:03:20.160]  things like we must stamp out the spirit and soul of man in terms of the technocracy so
[3:03:20.160 --> 3:03:26.080]  does he really believe that or is he deceiving himself and thus attempting to enact the thing
[3:03:26.080 --> 3:03:31.120]  that is ultimately as we say a rebellion against God and any notions of the transcendent I think
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:37.680]  it's the latter but let's see what Russell says in his book he goes on to talk about early on that
[3:03:37.680 --> 3:03:42.560]  the the guy that wrote the introduction Papano he says that if you look to other people like
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:47.840]  JBS Haldane and other figures in the Royal Society circles they were all intent on bringing in this
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:56.800]  world federation world government eugenics based society and the notion of brave new world also
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:01.920]  comes from these same people the same circles the Huxleys right remember we've covered Julian
[3:04:01.920 --> 3:04:07.840]  Huxley's philosophy of the United Nations education and cultural organization UNESCO
[3:04:07.840 --> 3:04:11.440]  so Julian wrote the philosophy of UNESCO and basically what he did in that book was just
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:16.720]  cloak all of the depopulation in eugenics philosophy into something new called transhumanism
[3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:23.520]  and bioethics and biometrics that's the new cloak and the new cover for radical depopulation and
[3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:28.720]  eugenics that is the ethos that is the essence of everything that they're bringing in right now the
[3:04:28.720 --> 3:04:34.000]  whole great reset is this it is based on this I sure you've seen this week the article going around
[3:04:34.000 --> 3:04:39.840]  about how Klaus Schwab was essentially recruited by the CIA out of this Harvard program essentially
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:46.560]  established by none other than Henry Kissinger himself and here we are right but yet this week
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:51.120]  I've had people telling me this doesn't exist it's not real so let's get when we come back we're
[3:04:51.120 --> 3:04:55.200]  going to look at virtual scientific outlook in depth and see that it absolutely is real
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:03.440]  our world is so full of hype we're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media
[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:10.240]  by the controlled churches and universities why is this the case because we innately by God
[3:05:11.040 --> 3:05:16.160]  have been given the keys to our own minds our own psyches our own souls and by connecting to God
[3:05:16.160 --> 3:05:23.600]  we can empower ourselves and trend sin the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we
[3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:30.240]  ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering
[3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:35.120]  us they're only making us depressed and the end they're only making us less fulfilled it is only
[3:05:35.120 --> 3:05:40.400]  by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves that's
[3:05:40.400 --> 3:05:45.360]  why the globals bombard us with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins
[3:05:45.360 --> 3:05:51.440]  and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out
[3:05:51.440 --> 3:06:01.040]  beyond the third dimension and that's where the incredible products come in at m4store.com
[3:06:01.040 --> 3:06:06.800]  welcome back to the oxjohn show we're talking about the famous yet not very well known book
[3:06:06.800 --> 3:06:12.080]  by Bertrand Russell the scientific outlook and we're working through this text that he wrote
[3:06:12.080 --> 3:06:19.200]  back in 1931 about how the future would see the rise of this technocratic world government
[3:06:19.200 --> 3:06:25.520]  that would basically be modeled on Plato's Republic and accept a radical depopulation agenda in order
[3:06:25.520 --> 3:06:30.320]  to bring this in and of course that this would be the only way to save the human race that's
[3:06:30.320 --> 3:06:34.320]  literally Russell's philosophy and keep in mind a lot of people are duped when they first start
[3:06:34.320 --> 3:06:41.120]  looking at this with their naivety by thinking that but but he was a liberal in another book he says
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:46.560]  at the beginning that he hopes that it doesn't turn into something bad yeah and then he contradicts
[3:06:46.560 --> 3:06:51.040]  himself and says but we need to do it right impact of science on society for example another one of
[3:06:51.040 --> 3:06:58.240]  his texts that he wrote later on he said well you know war can bring about depopulation but
[3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:03.200]  actually it doesn't do that good what we really need is something like a mass bio-release or a black
[3:07:03.200 --> 3:07:08.400]  plague that could help to radically reduce population so he says that towards the end of impact of
[3:07:08.400 --> 3:07:16.240]  science on society so that was written later in 1953 so Russell never did eschew these positions
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:23.680]  that he had all along in fact you can't be in the royal society or or amongst the Fabian society
[3:07:23.680 --> 3:07:30.080]  elites if you do not adopt a radical depopulation agenda that is fundamental that is 101 to every
[3:07:30.080 --> 3:07:34.400]  one of the global elites that we've looked at every one of the books that we've lectured through
[3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:39.440]  we've done almost 60 of these writings of the elite and there's not one of them not a single one of
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:45.520]  them that promotes the idea that humans are good or that we should not depopulate every one of them
[3:07:45.520 --> 3:07:53.200]  to a T must accept depopulation on a radical scale every one of them accepts Darwinism every one of
[3:07:53.200 --> 3:07:59.360]  them accepts atheistic materialism or Luciferianism or Satanism every one of them accepts right a
[3:07:59.360 --> 3:08:05.520]  world government a world currency digital cashless society that is the ethos that is the cult if you
[3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:11.120]  do not accept the dogmas of the scientism cult of the new world order you are not led into the cult
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:18.480]  fundamental 101 now Russell goes on to excuse me the introductory guy goes on to say that Russell
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:25.200]  is a scientific technocrat you could say that Russell's whole philosophy of scientism and really
[3:08:25.200 --> 3:08:31.280]  the the religion of the future he says is essentially something scientific and just like all of his
[3:08:31.280 --> 3:08:36.240]  other comrades in these circles H.G. Wells right all the characters that we've looked at in the
[3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:40.640]  last few weeks or the fourth hour of Alex Jones show the months that we've done this they all
[3:08:40.640 --> 3:08:47.040]  talk about a new world religion that's a cloak or their inner core religion that is scientism
[3:08:48.560 --> 3:08:54.320]  and he says that we should look to the figures of the ancient world who really combated any
[3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:58.400]  notion of the divine any notion of transcendence and so he begins his book with this sort of
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:04.400]  propaganda essay on the whole of science right the saints of science is essentially what he does
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:09.280]  and he says that they they gave us the scientific method the great scientists of the past and I
[3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:12.800]  want to be clear I don't hate science I don't disagree with science at all I mean I I believe
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:20.000]  science comes out of the whole western Christian ethos and even the Byzantine ethos right science
[3:09:20.000 --> 3:09:27.120]  itself comes out universities come out of Byzantium and medieval Christianity so I don't have a problem
[3:09:27.120 --> 3:09:33.200]  with science but most people think of science as whatever a bunch of experts just say and that's
[3:09:33.200 --> 3:09:38.400]  actually a social engineering tool not actually science at all in fact what have we seen the buzz
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:44.960]  word of the last two years trust the science bro trust the science well my wife just did a podcast
[3:09:44.960 --> 3:09:51.840]  over on her channel Jamie Henshaw and she covered the the top 10 mad scientist experiments of the
[3:09:51.840 --> 3:09:58.400]  last 100 years just insane stuff everything to kenzie basically molesting children for science
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:04.800]  for science for science all for science brah do you doubt the science trust the science well that
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:10.080]  sounds like a religion doesn't it well exactly and in fact amazingly Bertrand Russell himself
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:16.160]  in the first few chapters admits the fundamental beliefs of science and the scientific method
[3:10:16.160 --> 3:10:21.200]  cannot be demonstrated I kid you not he says that and this is actually a famous problem in
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:25.360]  philosophy I just did a lecture on this yesterday on my youtube channel now what does that mean
[3:10:25.360 --> 3:10:29.600]  that there is no science or that we can't know no it just means that the presuppositions of science
[3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:34.080]  the scientific method the existence of the external world the regularity of nature what
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:40.160]  David Hume called induction right the regularity of the methods and the logic behind science itself
[3:10:40.160 --> 3:10:46.240]  can't be scientifically demonstrated it has to be assumed so science itself is actually ironically
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:50.720]  faith-based I'm not saying that it doesn't produce results but the methods and the principles
[3:10:50.720 --> 3:10:56.800]  themselves the scientific method as a thing itself cannot be demonstrated through the scientific
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:01.280]  method it's an assumption and Bertrand Russell says hey we can't prove that we don't know if
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:06.080]  it's true we're just going to have to assume that it is the case so science ironically the scientific
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:15.120]  method itself is a faith-based operation he goes on to say Russell himself now that the the the
[3:11:15.120 --> 3:11:20.400]  modern world cannot be understood apart from understanding important place of the royal
[3:11:20.400 --> 3:11:25.920]  society and the royal society is really the origin point from where we get the modern
[3:11:25.920 --> 3:11:33.680]  scientism religion of today he goes on of course to admit that Darwin for him is basically a saint
[3:11:33.680 --> 3:11:41.840]  figure and the atomistic materialist universe that Darwin supposedly proved is what really gets
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:48.240]  rid of all the the things that held us back from enacting a true world government a true
[3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:54.560]  technocratic ordered society because what it does is that it allows us to figure out who are the
[3:11:54.560 --> 3:12:00.320]  useless eaters that use up the world's resources and now we know that there's no morality holding
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:06.320]  us back from getting rid of them this is the logic that he uses here you see he says that
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:13.280]  there's no such thing anymore as being as form those are just human constructs right he does
[3:12:13.280 --> 3:12:17.600]  think math is a real thing although he did have several debates with other famous philosophers
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:21.840]  like Kurt Girdel the mathematician and even though Russell lost that debate concerning
[3:12:21.840 --> 3:12:27.840]  how to justify max mathematical axioms he's still charged forward with it doesn't matter
[3:12:27.840 --> 3:12:34.400]  because for example JB Watson has proven that man has no soul of course Watson didn't prove that
[3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:39.520]  as a psychologist he didn't prove that but the argument is that well under the microscope I don't
[3:12:39.520 --> 3:12:45.280]  see a soul so there must not be a soul okay but under the microscope you don't see numbers you
[3:12:45.280 --> 3:12:50.320]  don't see math you don't see logic and yet the scientific method is using math numbers and logic
[3:12:50.320 --> 3:12:57.920]  to do its very process so it becomes a self-refuting silly exercise to act like well because I don't
[3:12:57.920 --> 3:13:02.800]  see it under the microscope it does not exist right do you can you observe the past under
[3:13:02.800 --> 3:13:07.920]  a microscope can you observe your thoughts under microscope well how absurd would it be to say
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:14.480]  that those things don't exist do you observe a self under a microscope of course not and yet
[3:13:14.480 --> 3:13:19.120]  who is having the experience of looking in the microscope who is doing the science well obviously
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:24.000]  some being that has consciousness or itself you see the foolishness the self-refuting absurdity
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:29.680]  of this worldview in this position but they don't care and in fact Russell says we have gotten rid
[3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:34.480]  of purpose in the world there is no such thing as purpose in the world there is no telos at all
[3:13:34.480 --> 3:13:39.600]  he says there's a disteleological world on page 36 and he says now the scientific priest class
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:46.240]  can step up to the plate and we can commandeer and control evolution we will steer it and that
[3:13:46.240 --> 3:13:52.800]  gives us a divine mandate even though there is no divine they mean themselves to mutate man through
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:57.520]  experimentation through mastic population and you're going to be really surprised probably blown
[3:13:57.520 --> 3:14:04.320]  away with this so-called western freedomatic advocate this this man as a champion of liberal
[3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:10.560]  democracy and western democracy well you're going to be really surprised at who he holds up as
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:16.880]  preeminent examples of western democracy of democracy and technocratic scientific government
[3:14:16.880 --> 3:14:22.800]  and you tell me you hear the term scientific governance run for the hills because that is a
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:29.600]  mad science experiment that was going to result and always has resulted in the last 100 years
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:41.440]  democide democide mass death chaos Russell goes on to say well there are some experiments that
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:47.120]  are going on right now in the world and he says these are experiments on a large scale
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:54.560]  one of those experiments he says is the soviet government he says he is impressed
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:15:00.800]  with the soviet government and in fact when he looks at the world scientific dictatorships and
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:06.480]  he looks at Pavlovian conditioning and how the soviet government utilize these techniques and
[3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:12.560]  principles to enforce this both with the Bolsheviks and with Stalin okay merchant Russell
[3:15:12.560 --> 3:15:16.640]  doesn't really have a big problem with either one of them at least at this stage when he wrote this
[3:15:16.640 --> 3:15:23.280]  right in the 30s he says I am very happy I'm very pleased with the social experiment going on in
[3:15:23.280 --> 3:15:29.280]  Russia with the Bolsheviks and the Stalinists and their scientific government do you understand
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:35.440]  that scientific government doesn't work it will produce mass death it always does this is what
[3:15:35.440 --> 3:15:40.480]  they are trying to sell the world on right now if you just accept scientific government we will
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:46.960]  create your kumpad dystopia and you can lay in your pod and just kum all day that's what they're
[3:15:46.960 --> 3:15:50.880]  literally saying they just put out an article now saying that there's kumpads no you can have these
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:54.720]  kumpads don't go anywhere it's going to get even crazier when you come back to the Alex Jones show

[3:19:58.640 --> 3:20:13.920]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones so as russell works his way through
[3:20:13.920 --> 3:20:20.800]  the famous text that at the same time is strangely little known the 1931 book scientific outlook he
[3:20:20.800 --> 3:20:27.920]  says the basic principles of science such as the notion of unity the external world purpose etc these
[3:20:27.920 --> 3:20:31.840]  are all illusory we don't have any knowledge of that it really doesn't exist he says we're
[3:20:31.840 --> 3:20:37.280]  going to act like it does though so science doesn't actually tell us truth it just tells us how things
[3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:42.800]  work supposedly so essentially russell is giving up the notion of truth claims giving up the notion
[3:20:42.800 --> 3:20:49.520]  of there being objective truth but he's at the same time saying science is true the scientific
[3:20:49.520 --> 3:20:54.240]  method is true you see do you see that this is a bait and switch this is called a philosophy of
[3:20:54.240 --> 3:21:00.080]  contradiction both of those things can't be true at the same time now as russell moves on to describe
[3:21:00.080 --> 3:21:05.440]  again how the notion of free will is itself a metaphysical illusion it's something like fairy
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:12.800]  tales it's like the existence of god right it's a it's a made-up idea he at the same time believes
[3:21:12.800 --> 3:21:20.480]  that he writes his books that he was the one that earned the you know Nobel prize and was the order
[3:21:20.480 --> 3:21:27.440]  of you know whatever as the as lord birch and russell so he thinks that he freely earned these
[3:21:27.440 --> 3:21:31.120]  titles and wrote these books and he should get paid and he gets royalties or whatever
[3:21:31.120 --> 3:21:35.600]  i mean he's not alive now but but at the same time he's turning around and saying there is no
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:42.480]  free will nobody has agency and responsibility do you see that there's a radical disconnect
[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:46.400]  right between the thing that he's saying and preaching and the way that he actually lives
[3:21:46.400 --> 3:21:51.520]  and acts in his life and i only point that out because most of the time the radical atheistic
[3:21:51.520 --> 3:21:56.080]  materialists these kinds of people they don't actually live the thing that they say is the case
[3:21:56.080 --> 3:22:00.080]  because you can't really nobody really lives consistent with those positions unless you're
[3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:04.240]  really really really really really really eat maybe birch and russell is one of the great
[3:22:04.240 --> 3:22:11.040]  contenders for wickedest men of the 20th century 19th century who knows maybe but he goes on to say
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:16.480]  ultimately we don't even know that there is an external world so here we have this curious
[3:22:17.520 --> 3:22:21.760]  early precedent for a salips what's called salipsism the idea that there is no world
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:26.560]  everything is just a projection of my mind and carl young spoke this way right so this is not
[3:22:26.560 --> 3:22:32.160]  not unheard of but it's it's bizarre in the realm of science for birch and russell to admit this as
[3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:37.120]  a man radically committed to materialism and and what we call scientism the religion of
[3:22:37.120 --> 3:22:42.160]  scientism to admit that we can't prove the external world yet that's the very thing that science
[3:22:42.160 --> 3:22:48.720]  is focused on right engineering understanding mastering the external world because i want to
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:54.720]  say that um there is no god because there is no truth there is no metaphysical truth all those
[3:22:54.720 --> 3:22:59.920]  things are concoctions and yet at the same time he doesn't seem to understand that to say that his
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:05.680]  materialistic worldview is true denies that very position denies that very presupposition at that
[3:23:05.680 --> 3:23:11.040]  point he goes on to make many many uh metaphysical claims while at the same time denying there are
[3:23:11.040 --> 3:23:19.760]  no metaphysics and he says that the only hope for man at this point is to set up a world government
[3:23:19.760 --> 3:23:29.680]  and get this because humans have created nuclear bombs so so the argument is that humans in general
[3:23:29.680 --> 3:23:34.720]  you're all collectively guilty because you invented technology and invented warfare technology like
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:40.240]  bombs and so we are going to have to kill you all and at the same time russell turns around and says
[3:23:41.040 --> 3:23:46.000]  the elite are the geniuses who have created and invented atomic bombs only the elite geniuses
[3:23:46.000 --> 3:23:51.440]  could have done this but he's collectively blaming the world for the thing that he takes credit for
[3:23:51.440 --> 3:23:57.280]  as a member of this elite i'm not saying he takes credit for himself making a bomb but he's saying
[3:23:57.280 --> 3:24:03.920]  that we are elite class are the one who who gave you this right and you are at fault and he says
[3:24:03.920 --> 3:24:09.840]  genetic modification for example genetic modification will save the world because genetic
[3:24:09.840 --> 3:24:16.240]  modification will allow us to feed the world do you see how even a hundred years ago these
[3:24:16.240 --> 3:24:23.920]  frauds were cloaking their actual agenda of mass depopulation in humanitarian garb this is what the
[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:28.320]  NGOs and think tanks all do right now right they go into these other countries we're here to promote
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:35.360]  freedom and democracy which is just means abortions vaccines right all of these sexual degeneracy
[3:24:35.360 --> 3:24:42.720]  things that's that's all it is and it's social moral warfare morals can be a form of warfare
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:48.720]  soft power it's a form of exerting soft power through things like color revolution things like
[3:24:48.720 --> 3:24:54.960]  toxic pop culture and i'm just saying there's not anything new ultimately with the elite class
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:58.720]  because if we go back a hundred years birch and russell's talking about it here he's talking about
[3:24:58.720 --> 3:25:06.160]  genetic modification being able to feed the planet but ultimately he says it's not really
[3:25:06.160 --> 3:25:10.560]  going to feed the planet because what we're going to do is feed the planet with fake food
[3:25:11.600 --> 3:25:19.520]  a hundred years ago he promoted fake food a hundred years later big agra big pharma big food
[3:25:19.520 --> 3:25:24.400]  are all promoting fake food every day right now and he wrote this a hundred years ago
[3:25:24.400 --> 3:25:30.240]  and he doesn't say i wonder if it'll be this way he says we will do this it's a plan
[3:25:31.200 --> 3:25:32.960]  it's not speculation it's a plan
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:41.680]  genetic modification will allow for the elite he says this i shared it on my twitter it went viral
[3:25:41.680 --> 3:25:46.800]  it got i don't know thousands of views and then whatever so i'm not making this up you can go find
[3:25:46.800 --> 3:25:56.720]  it he says the synthetic food will be given to the masses but the elite will continue to eat their
[3:25:56.720 --> 3:26:02.800]  steaks well that's interesting that sounds like what playdough said a long time ago that the
[3:26:02.800 --> 3:26:07.040]  that the elite would continue to eat meat so that they could be virile that they would have the
[3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:11.120]  nutrients that they needed the masses will eat a bunch of kibble and plant food
[3:26:11.120 --> 3:26:19.840]  food and rustle makes no bones about that being a genetic modification basically a gigantic world
[3:26:19.840 --> 3:26:28.640]  experiment then he goes on to say that get this a hundred years ago peak oil he talked about peak
[3:26:28.640 --> 3:26:33.600]  oil which is a scam a hundred years ago and in fact it's some of the biggest oil companies
[3:26:33.600 --> 3:26:39.680]  that promote the notion of peak oil because all that is is a way to squeeze out competition and
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:45.520]  control the market that's it right and and it's not a fossil fuel by the way oil is not dinosaur
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:50.320]  juice i don't know what oil is but i know that it's not crushed up dinosaur juice and yet all of
[3:26:50.320 --> 3:26:54.720]  the so-called smart people the public academics and intellectuals they keep they always call it
[3:26:54.720 --> 3:27:00.800]  fossil fuels they always talk about it being a scarce resource that we don't have enough of
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:08.000]  that's all intentional starving and and resource cutting off right it's austerity that's done on
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  purpose that's why they shut down the pipelines on purpose that's what biden has done that's what
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:20.080]  they do and they do it on purpose to give the impression that we don't have enough of this
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:26.480]  it's all a scam it's what the bolsheviks did it's a form of terror right trotsky it's trotskyites
[3:27:26.480 --> 3:27:34.400]  did this solin did this right you intentionally create famine scarcity blame it on your enemies
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:40.320]  it's a form of economic resource false flag it's very simple it's not i mean how
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:46.480]  bursa rose a hundred years ago said that peak oil could be a tool could be the way that they could
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:53.200]  say humans are using up too many resources blame the masses blame the people the useless eaters
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:57.760]  and then you can turn a gigantic portion of the population on itself
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:05.680]  and then the mob zombie mass that's just silly putty in the hands of the elite thinks that the
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:11.200]  other half of the masses the conservatives or whoever are at fault they're the ones that need
[3:28:11.200 --> 3:28:17.120]  to be killed because you're causing all of this rush is causing all of this you're doing this
[3:28:18.560 --> 3:28:21.680]  the stupidest most low IQ take imaginable
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:28.160]  brussel goes on to say that not only will we stop there he says we'll move on to the entire
[3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:32.640]  biosphere exactly what claus Schwab says in the last third of his book fourth and elsewhere
[3:28:32.640 --> 3:28:40.480]  evolution he says we will master the weather and we'll be able to control and cause storms
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:47.360]  rains droughts climate change brussel said a hundred years ago they would do that
[3:28:47.360 --> 3:28:52.720]  that they'll go anywhere when we come back i'm going to show you even crazier things
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:28:54.960]  in virgin rossel scientific outlook this is a lot of show

[3:33:11.840 --> 3:33:16.640]  welcome back to the alex johnson i'm your guest host j dire analysis if you're interested in
[3:33:16.640 --> 3:33:23.360]  getting your health in order i highly recommend going over to the info war store and making use
[3:33:23.360 --> 3:33:28.720]  of those products that are over there help support the info war and alex jones keep him on the air
[3:33:29.280 --> 3:33:34.560]  this is definitely the tip of the spear and we need to stay here now let's get into the notion of
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:39.200]  terraforming and weather control which person rossel says would be the future so he 100 years
[3:33:39.200 --> 3:33:44.240]  ago he's saying geoengineering will really be what we're going to do and he even calls it a great
[3:33:44.240 --> 3:33:49.680]  work he says that this mechanistic attitude of the scientific technocratic elite will be such
[3:33:49.680 --> 3:33:55.680]  that they will be able to have a monopoly over all of the production of the world all of the
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:01.920]  capital in the world and he says that capitalism monopoly capitalism not capitalism itself will
[3:34:01.920 --> 3:34:09.600]  lead to ironically a kind of socialized technocratic world government so i'm just like hg wells and
[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:15.840]  remember rossel was part of that fabian social society he and hg wells didn't really see monopolistic
[3:34:15.840 --> 3:34:20.640]  capitalism as any problem or any bump on the road to their end goal of world socialist government
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:27.520]  in fact they say it is then the necessary means to an end only monopolistic capitalism they say
[3:34:28.240 --> 3:34:33.680]  is sufficient to erect the superstructure of the global government and the technocracy and then
[3:34:33.680 --> 3:34:42.240]  it will flip into a top-down fascist technocracy so you're not gonna have free enterprise you're
[3:34:42.240 --> 3:34:47.840]  gonna have a business all of that will be bought up centralized and then everything will be crushed
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:53.840]  he says now what did we just see this week announced black rock all of this everything
[3:34:53.840 --> 3:34:59.280]  will be bought up you will be made poor and you will be crushed he said it 100 years ago the exact
[3:34:59.280 --> 3:35:04.880]  same thing that the same elite are saying now now is it a coincidence that the elites of 100 years
[3:35:04.880 --> 3:35:14.240]  ago say the exact same thing to a t 100 years later or are you caught in cognitive dissonance
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:23.520]  and lying to yourself maybe you spent too much time watching sports ball games and not reading
[3:35:23.520 --> 3:35:30.560]  what these people say next he goes on to say that fertilizers are a key thing to controlling
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:37.520]  world order food production and government yes fertilizers and he says that fertilizers are
[3:35:37.520 --> 3:35:43.680]  important because they're necessary for feeding the masses and so they were aware again 100 years
[3:35:43.680 --> 3:35:50.480]  ago that you could target different note supply chain areas different nodes to shut down different
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:57.360]  sections right it's a form of advanced technical warfare that uses food diet and food chains
[3:35:58.640 --> 3:36:03.920]  he says that what we're gonna have to do though is master bio warfare and when we master both
[3:36:03.920 --> 3:36:12.880]  bio warfare and breeding science then we have the means by which we can engineer and set into place
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:18.000]  the final revolution of world government and technocracy now birch and russell again always
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:24.160]  couches his technocracy in liberal loving terms or you're gonna have there's gonna be freedom and
[3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:28.400]  it's gonna be because only the scientific elite will be allowed to live so you understand when
[3:36:28.400 --> 3:36:34.000]  they talk about freedom they're saying for us for the science crowd for the people that wear
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:39.680]  lab coats we alone with our magical lab coats will go into the future with our hallowed godlike
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:46.320]  beakers and bottles of science juice that bubble behind us we're so beautiful we are the beautiful
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:52.880]  ones right that's what he says right he this is his view and he says that when we master breeding
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:37:00.960]  science not only will we engineer the elite to be uber mensch godmen we can engineer it to where
[3:37:00.960 --> 3:37:05.680]  the other classes and the other people who are not amongst the so-called scientific elite to become
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:12.720]  more uh uh eloy and more like to become more locks right from h.c. wells's novel and turn them
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:18.480]  into basically goblins it seems like the public is already half goblin right they're turned they're
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:23.520]  being turned into goblins they have been hit with a retardation ray they are becoming goblins i'm
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:29.360]  not being mean but that's true and it's not their fault it's the engineered plan of these people
[3:37:31.040 --> 3:37:36.400]  turn the public into goblins is the plan the goblin secret plan
[3:37:36.400 --> 3:37:48.960]  then he goes on to say that um entities like giant biotech companies or food companies or
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:58.160]  big pharma companies will be able to tweak and change dna and impose new means of birth control
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:02.800]  such that the races of the world will be able to be brought down in their numbers so significantly
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:10.160]  that we can finally achieve this uh sustainable level of population what do the georgia guides
[3:38:10.160 --> 3:38:16.080]  don't say right the exact same thing birch and russell says world world population must be brought
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:23.840]  down and in fact the most shocking section which we just saw rolled out in the last two years one
[3:38:23.840 --> 3:38:34.640]  page 126 of my copy is where he talks about children and infants can be the lab rats for
[3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:41.680]  mass stabby types of programs very the very thing that jonah salk says in his book survival the
[3:38:41.680 --> 3:38:48.480]  wisest and he basically says it like an island of dr morrow type of scenario right uh if you
[3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:53.840]  want to see a really terrible movie go watch the val kilmer uh marlon brando movie all into
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:38:57.760]  dr rome it's actually funny it's so bad but that's what we're talking about here it's that right
[3:38:57.760 --> 3:39:03.600]  and that movie is so bad it's actually funny to watch but if you go read the hc wells novel which
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:07.920]  i have read it's really saying this it's saying the exact same thing that birch and russell is
[3:39:07.920 --> 3:39:12.640]  talking about on page 126 and notice that they always write these real plans into the science
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:18.160]  fiction hc wells the father modern science fiction island dr morrow basically describes a mad
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:23.680]  scientist on an island who thinks he's god the marlon brando character who's all it looks like
[3:39:23.680 --> 3:39:29.680]  looks like a powdered donut and he's over there injecting different genetics into other species
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:35.120]  or a different dna into other species to create these aberrations and the mutations these chimeras
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:43.440]  because he thinks that he can breed out of individuals out of humans the desire to eat
[3:39:43.440 --> 3:39:49.600]  meat and to be a predator i'm not joking so part of the reason that they want to breed out the notion
[3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:57.120]  of eating meat being being virile being strong and masculine is because they think that number one
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:01.600]  it's a warfare against their competition they're scared of anyone that's an alpha male that's not
[3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:07.200]  going to submit to whatever their dictates are but on another level they think that it's necessary
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:17.680]  to produce and to study the mutations that will lead to the more advanced more evolved
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:23.040]  version of the species how do we evolve into the god man oh well why don't we just experiment on the
[3:40:23.040 --> 3:40:28.880]  world turn them all into goblins and see what has a negative effect to see what has a positive
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:33.600]  effect that's basically the attitude here so the island of dr morrow is an allegory for the world
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:41.920]  it's the world that is the island of these people these people are dr morrow and i'm not joking
[3:40:41.920 --> 3:40:47.840]  that's not my interpretation that's what ashe wells is talking about they're basically saying
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:55.680]  we're god we are the ones that have the scientific knowledge our religion is this death cult
[3:40:57.600 --> 3:41:00.640]  now they wouldn't say it's a death cult they would say well we're just working with the
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:06.080]  principle of death that's in nature and so our job is to just master that and sometimes i'm sorry
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:12.800]  we do have to use death as a tool but we're god so don't worry about it but also by the way your
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:18.640]  pond scum but also you can become a god their religion so so they have this new agey occult
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:23.360]  satanic religion that tells you you can become a god while at the same time it tells you that
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:28.880]  man is meaningless worthless he's he has no significance floating on a rocker space
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:33.680]  in a gigantic vast meaningless empty universe oh but also by the way you could become a god
[3:41:33.680 --> 3:41:38.800]  bro right the religion of now the religion of the new age that they promote tells you that you're
[3:41:38.800 --> 3:41:43.920]  a god but also that you're meaningless that's called double think double mind so notice that
[3:41:43.920 --> 3:41:50.560]  everything that birch and russell puts out is a contradiction and there were some really low
[3:41:50.560 --> 3:41:55.680]  iq atheists and pagans that were coming at me on twitter this last week because they picked up
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:41:59.440]  birch and russell's impact of science on society they read the first chapter and they said
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:07.840]  he's not a he ain't for this he he he says it's a bad thing do you know that he's part of the
[3:42:07.840 --> 3:42:19.120]  society that orwell is writing about who believes in putting out contradictions in their own writings
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:26.640]  to gaslight you double think orwell was talking about what these people do and that that's their
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:32.560]  plan and it's actually a psychological warfare strategy to on the one hand say of course i
[3:42:32.560 --> 3:42:38.960]  don't support a world government that's going to tyrannically kill everyone but i do support a
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:44.560]  world government that will tyrannically kill everyone in a nice way that's what they do they're
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:50.160]  liars and you have to see that and they were lying 100 years ago the way they lie now
[3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:59.920]  let's go gaslighting contradict we are only offering three coins in the series the first

[3:47:14.640 --> 3:47:19.120]  to support my work you can go to my website you can purchase signed copies of my books
[3:47:19.760 --> 3:47:23.280]  as you recall it would one and two where i cover a lot of these topics and a lot of these
[3:47:23.280 --> 3:47:28.080]  deeper philosophical themes in film so it's actually a great means a great tool for waking
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:32.080]  people up and they like to read if they like movies you can kind of get them into this
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:38.960]  this type of material in a backdoor kind of way now we were talking about the notion of a technocratic
[3:47:38.960 --> 3:47:44.880]  world government and depopulation that burton russell described throughout many of his texts
[3:47:44.880 --> 3:47:49.760]  and especially in the book impact of science on society and the scientific outlook now i want to
[3:47:49.760 --> 3:47:58.240]  briefly skip over to the the text the impact of science on society that he wrote about 20 years
[3:47:58.240 --> 3:48:06.800]  later and he didn't change his views at all now he had again still a lot of usage for this liberal
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:10.880]  cover and so if you go to impact of science on society russell kind of writes the first several
[3:48:10.880 --> 3:48:16.720]  chapters with this thin veneer of there could be a global government there could be a tyrannical
[3:48:17.440 --> 3:48:22.880]  you know stomping on liberties and and and changing people through the food and through the diet
[3:48:22.880 --> 3:48:30.560]  and then people read a few chow well i guess he's against it because he he doesn't say he's good
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:34.800]  but they didn't read the rest of the book where he goes on to say there's just a nicer way to do it
[3:48:35.680 --> 3:48:42.560]  but is it really nicer well let's see what he says later on on page uh 104 russell goes on to say
[3:48:43.280 --> 3:48:50.400]  these considerations prove that a scientific world society cannot be stable unless there is a
[3:48:50.400 --> 3:48:57.200]  world government clearly he's advocating this then he goes on to say in the next page uh regarding
[3:48:57.200 --> 3:49:03.360]  the notion of population he says that the world will have achieved in the future a new stability
[3:49:03.360 --> 3:49:11.120]  but at the cost of everything that gives value to human life are mere numbers that important
[3:49:11.120 --> 3:49:16.720]  and he goes on to say that we were going to have to bring the numbers of the population down i do
[3:49:16.720 --> 3:49:21.760]  not pretend that birth control is the only way which population can be kept from increasing
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:28.400]  there are others which one must suppose opponents of birth control would would prefer war as i've
[3:49:28.400 --> 3:49:33.280]  said a moment ago has hitherto been disappointing in this respect in terms of bringing human
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:38.480]  population down so in other words he wishes that war would kill more people but it doesn't really
[3:49:38.480 --> 3:49:46.160]  work well dr lord russell tell us what is the best way to do this perhaps bacteriological war
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:52.320]  would prove more effective if a black death could be spread throughout the world once in every
[3:49:52.320 --> 3:49:57.600]  generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full
[3:50:00.960 --> 3:50:10.400]  so who who actually believes that that's him being a soft-hearted liberal who doesn't want
[3:50:10.400 --> 3:50:18.080]  to do this i mean how naive are you how stupid are you to think that this man who wrote other
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:22.240]  essays about how to bring the world population down there's one called war and population that
[3:50:22.240 --> 3:50:27.440]  he wrote where he says here's how to bring population down right it's called population
[3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:32.320]  pressure and war it's a 1957 essay that merchant russell wrote after this book by the way which
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:39.680]  was in 1953 i shared that on my twitter right now you can go read the the essay population pressure
[3:50:39.680 --> 3:50:44.400]  and war now clearly merchant russell thought that war wasn't good enough because it doesn't kill enough
[3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:57.600]  people now he goes on to say that if we could understand the unconscious inner world of man
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:03.120]  and his desires and his motivations then we're gonna have to master the inner man the mind so he's
[3:51:03.120 --> 3:51:08.880]  this is prior to right mind control experiments no but keep in mind hoxley russell these people
[3:51:08.880 --> 3:51:13.760]  were kind of early pioneers of what would become the mind control experiments known as mk ultra
[3:51:14.480 --> 3:51:20.720]  the tavastock institute and so forth in the uk but he says that really the way to do this is
[3:51:20.720 --> 3:51:27.120]  through physical control of the mind in the sense of watson and behaviorism so he's a huge
[3:51:27.120 --> 3:51:32.480]  proponent of operant condition and behaviorism what would become operant conditioning again
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:39.760]  these are the people way ahead of the people two or three decades later who pioneer so called these
[3:51:39.760 --> 3:51:49.040]  sciences and yet at the same time they are hailed as the heroes and the saviors of humanity because
[3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:56.320]  as dr. jose delgado wrote the book physical control of the mind the famous mk ultra doctor
[3:51:56.320 --> 3:52:00.880]  operating on the physical materialist worldview paradigm that merchant russell has part of the
[3:52:00.880 --> 3:52:06.880]  mk ultra project which is connected to birch and russell through tavastock how russell had a connection
[3:52:06.880 --> 3:52:17.760]  to tavastock dr. has it hose delgado wanted to achieve for the cia total physical control of the
[3:52:17.760 --> 3:52:25.600]  mind in the next chapter technique in society russell goes on to say that what's the real ethos
[3:52:25.600 --> 3:52:33.200]  of this he says go back to malthus to darwin adam smith and david rickardo and you will notice
[3:52:33.200 --> 3:52:40.560]  that what they did was not just give us an economic theory but they put economics ultimately as it
[3:52:40.560 --> 3:52:46.480]  would as it would evolve in the british empire in line with darwinism this is called social
[3:52:46.480 --> 3:52:52.640]  darwinism right applying darwin's theories to society which gives the technocratic elite in
[3:52:52.640 --> 3:53:03.920]  their view the mandate to dominate everyone else and to put them out of existence russell goes on
[3:53:03.920 --> 3:53:12.800]  to say that the the coming technocracy that they're going to bring in in pages 140 141 2 3
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:21.040]  is going to have to use a kind of soft measure soft power to incrementally bring this in now
[3:53:21.040 --> 3:53:26.320]  he might have gotten this idea from being in the fabian socialist society because their whole ethos
[3:53:26.320 --> 3:53:34.000]  was the turtle bringing this in slowly their original logo was a wolf in sheep's clothing
[3:53:35.520 --> 3:53:43.760]  russell says that toxic culture will produce uniformity the press the movies education mass
[3:53:43.760 --> 3:53:52.400]  media will produce the kind of society where everyone is a brainwash zombie he says hollywood
[3:53:52.400 --> 3:53:56.800]  at this time he's writing in the 30s he says hollywood is rising as a wonderful example of this
[3:53:57.520 --> 3:54:03.440]  he said he says hollywood is the new high priest of the hollywood religion you've heard me saying
[3:54:03.440 --> 3:54:15.520]  that for 10 years i got it from this russell says it is time to abandon two barbaric ideas
[3:54:15.520 --> 3:54:21.040]  the nation state and the gold standard or a hard standard of money and he says that these
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:27.840]  are going to have to go away so that we can end all borders and the bordered nation state firewall
[3:54:27.840 --> 3:54:38.320]  can give way to the technocratic world government the world society the culture war or the toxic
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:43.920]  culture of hollywood and mass media and pop culture and pop music he said in the 30s would bring
[3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:49.120]  about the liberal the liberalization and revolutionary ethos to the whole world it's a global
[3:54:49.760 --> 3:54:57.600]  culture war that will create a mono culture a mono society for the masses they will be
[3:54:57.600 --> 3:55:04.320]  initiated into it brought into processed into a global government without their even knowing it
[3:55:05.520 --> 3:55:10.160]  you don't even have to be conscious of this because you are being ceded the messages in the
[3:55:10.160 --> 3:55:14.800]  pop culture for decades and decades and decades i wrote two books on it i wrote a master's thesis
[3:55:14.800 --> 3:55:19.440]  on it it didn't end up being a master's thesis but that's what i was writing on it ended it did get
[3:55:19.440 --> 3:55:26.000]  peer review published however on this topic so i do know this topic and it's intentional and it
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:35.440]  it moves from just getting you to agree to a mono culture he says to planned transhumanism
[3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:43.200]  in other words the pop culture will eventually cede and teach people the religion of transhumanism
[3:55:44.400 --> 3:55:49.520]  and they don't even know it he says that the state cult
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:56.480]  will initiate people into this religion it's a fake religion he says it's not a real religion
[3:55:57.280 --> 3:56:03.520]  but he says that it will be the cloak for the inner scientific elite and control mechanism
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:09.680]  that is using the religion as an outer portico a profane outer portico for the masses while in
[3:56:09.680 --> 3:56:15.120]  the inner core it's a scientific elite that is using all the techniques of mind control
[3:56:15.120 --> 3:56:21.680]  collectivism socialization etc etc etc that they've learned in the last century through
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:28.080]  the theaters of war did you know that wartime is a gigantic test tube rnd experiment i've covered
[3:56:28.080 --> 3:56:34.640]  that for many years now many books written on that vietnam was a gigantic experiment social
[3:56:34.640 --> 3:56:41.440]  experiment tech experiment some of the first drones and ai and bio warfare methods were rolled out
[3:56:41.440 --> 3:56:47.040]  and tested in vietnam all the elite and these oligarchs have done is take all of that research
[3:56:47.040 --> 3:56:57.600]  and combine it into one big ball of goblin crap then he goes on to say the soviets for example
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:57:04.560]  were an earlier attempt at a perfect scientific government bolshevism Stalinism the soviet
[3:57:04.560 --> 3:57:11.280]  society was an experiment to see could we have a new world order now he says that this system
[3:57:11.280 --> 3:57:17.600]  didn't really work or it may not work it may fall away but it's an experiment to bring about
[3:57:18.320 --> 3:57:24.560]  the world soviet socialist republic of the technocracy that's what virgin russell says
[3:57:25.440 --> 3:57:30.560]  scientific outlook if you want to get more of this i did a whole lecture on multiple
[3:57:30.560 --> 3:57:34.800]  virgin russell books you can go to my website and subscribe for access to the entire archives
[3:57:34.800 --> 3:57:39.840]  where i cover 50 60 of these elite texts many many podcasts and interviews over my website
[3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:45.360]  jason elsis dot com remember to go to the info war store and get all of those supplies stop shopping
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:50.640]  at the big box ladies and gentlemen i need your help i need your help keeping info wars on the
[3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:57.120]  air and strong i need your help making sure that our mission continues on i was born for this you
[3:57:57.120 --> 3:58:03.040]  were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[3:58:03.040 --> 3:58:08.000]  because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:13.200]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[3:58:13.200 --> 3:58:19.680]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[3:58:19.680 --> 3:58:26.720]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership
[3:58:26.720 --> 3:58:32.720]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[3:58:32.720 --> 3:58:37.600]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale
[3:58:37.600 --> 3:58:42.800]  in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 off getting
[3:58:42.800 --> 3:58:49.600]  credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever the globalist social engineers always intended
[3:58:49.600 --> 3:58:57.920]  to push their covid biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then
[3:58:57.920 --> 3:59:04.080]  use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks
[3:59:04.080 --> 3:59:09.280]  out against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and
[3:59:09.280 --> 3:59:15.840]  others coming public and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people
[3:59:15.840 --> 3:59:22.960]  are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[3:59:22.960 --> 3:59:28.000]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their
[3:59:28.000 --> 3:59:34.720]  takeover like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario
[3:59:34.720 --> 3:59:39.680]  and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big time
[3:59:39.680 --> 3:59:44.800]  it's a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely
[3:59:44.800 --> 3:59:55.760]  paramount
