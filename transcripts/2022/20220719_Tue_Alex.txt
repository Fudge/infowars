[00:35.500 --> 00:38.400]  Info Wars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:46.800 --> 00:50.400]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say,
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.400]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[00:52.500 --> 00:56.000]  but you want to fight? You better believe you got one.
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.200]  From the front lines of the Info.
[01:01.800 --> 01:05.400]  Alex Jones is the greatest dude. He has been so canceled.
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.300]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:09.500 --> 01:13.300]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[01:13.400 --> 01:14.900]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.200]  Okay. Yeah.
[01:16.800 --> 01:18.900]  I just, I can justify it.
[01:19.300 --> 01:22.900]  I'll tell you that f***ing guy is right about a lot of s***.
[01:22.900 --> 01:28.200]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man and no one is perfect.
[01:28.300 --> 01:30.700]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[01:30.800 --> 01:33.300]  I've hung out with that guy. We've been hammered together so many times.
[01:33.400 --> 01:36.700]  It's like, that is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[01:36.800 --> 01:40.300]  Alex has been right on toward me over a decade.
[01:40.400 --> 01:42.300]  Shout out to Alex Jones. We love you.
[01:42.500 --> 01:44.600]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[01:44.800 --> 01:45.300]  End of story.
[01:45.300 --> 01:51.600]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.400]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a palm-throw or a conspiracy theorist
[01:57.500 --> 02:01.800]  because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[02:01.900 --> 02:08.900]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.300]  that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[02:12.400 --> 02:13.800]  He runs a media organization.
[02:13.900 --> 02:20.400]  And so when the January 6th committee subpoenas him, they're basically violating our First Amendment protections.
[02:20.400 --> 02:25.200]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the Capitol,
[02:25.300 --> 02:30.400]  but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[02:30.500 --> 02:35.600]  Now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[02:35.700 --> 02:36.600]  Yes, journalists.
[02:36.700 --> 02:39.900]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.600]  is subpoenaing Trump allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:44.700 --> 02:48.300]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[02:48.300 --> 02:53.000]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[02:53.100 --> 02:58.600]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[02:58.700 --> 03:00.800]  Let's start marching into the Capitol!
[03:00.900 --> 03:03.300]  Peace for America!
[03:03.400 --> 03:08.600]  Notice, by Don Jilger said, we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops.
[03:08.700 --> 03:10.400]  We're building America up.
[03:10.500 --> 03:13.000]  We're here to take our rightful country back.
[03:13.100 --> 03:14.300]  Peace for me!
[03:14.400 --> 03:17.800]  We're not running interference for Alex Jones and we're not guessing about it.
[03:17.800 --> 03:19.500]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[03:19.600 --> 03:23.800]  They need to not have the confrontation with the police.
[03:23.900 --> 03:25.500]  They're gonna make that the story.
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.700]  Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemonar.
[03:33.800 --> 03:35.900]  Absolutely. I was about to say the same thing.
[03:36.000 --> 03:36.900]  But there's a wide difference.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.100]  There's going to be like, don't insult Alex that way.
[03:38.200 --> 03:40.500]  Well, yeah, yeah, Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.400]  Right, right, right.
[03:41.500 --> 03:42.200]  True.
[03:42.300 --> 03:45.900]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:45.900 --> 03:49.200]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions,
[03:49.300 --> 03:51.000]  just as journalists are supposed to do.
[03:51.100 --> 03:52.800]  He wouldn't just slobber all over it.
[03:52.900 --> 03:54.700]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[03:54.800 --> 03:57.300]  He told me about Epstein a f***ing decade ago.
[03:57.400 --> 03:59.800]  Alex detailed all of that.
[03:59.900 --> 04:02.400]  Alex Jones, info wars.
[04:02.500 --> 04:08.300]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name calling, conspiracy theorist, bomb thrower.
[04:08.400 --> 04:13.800]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[04:13.800 --> 04:15.800]  He is as smart as a whip.
[04:15.900 --> 04:20.700]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in.
[04:20.800 --> 04:23.700]  And he also does his research and his homework.
[04:23.800 --> 04:29.700]  Coolie compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones's views on COVID and ask yourself,
[04:29.800 --> 04:30.700]  who's saner?
[04:30.800 --> 04:32.200]  It's not even close.
[04:32.300 --> 04:35.200]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[04:35.300 --> 04:36.700]  He loves this country.
[04:36.800 --> 04:42.200]  He is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better listen to.
[04:42.200 --> 04:45.600]  Is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones?
[04:45.700 --> 04:47.100]  They're no vaccine passports.
[04:47.200 --> 04:48.100]  That's insane.
[04:48.200 --> 04:49.600]  It's Alex Jones stuff.
[04:49.600 --> 05:15.500]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your vaccine papers.
[05:15.500 --> 05:20.400]  And look, the average stuff on the shelves is 5, 6, 7% pure humanoid.
[05:20.500 --> 05:23.400]  We have the strongest brand on earth.
[05:23.500 --> 05:24.900]  Nobody else decided to do it.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.900]  It's 95% humanoid at infowarstore.com.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.900]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% humanoid.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.400]  It is incredible.
[05:35.500 --> 05:39.900]  And what's even more incredible is it funds the info war.
[05:39.900 --> 05:47.300]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com.
[05:47.400 --> 05:49.300]  It is simply amazing.
[05:49.300 --> 06:14.700]  Discover the power of your humanoids at 95% at infowarstore.com today with body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[06:14.700 --> 06:19.600]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[06:23.200 --> 06:26.600]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[06:26.700 --> 06:27.600]  Just let me think.
[06:27.700 --> 06:32.600]  And even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will serve beyond their words.
[06:32.700 --> 06:33.600]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[06:33.700 --> 06:34.600]  Damn it.
[06:34.700 --> 06:35.600]  Why?
[06:35.700 --> 06:42.600]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[06:42.600 --> 06:47.500]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen, the annunciations of truth.
[06:47.600 --> 06:53.500]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[06:53.600 --> 06:54.500]  You decided, sir.
[06:54.600 --> 06:55.500]  You wanted it foolproof.
[06:55.600 --> 06:56.500]  You told me every television end longer.
[06:56.600 --> 07:00.500]  Cruelty and injustice and tolerance and depression.
[07:00.600 --> 07:07.500]  And where once you have the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now have senses and systems of surveillance,
[07:07.600 --> 07:11.500]  perversing your conformity and submachine cameras.
[07:11.500 --> 07:13.400]  How did this happen?
[07:13.500 --> 07:14.400]  Who's to blame?
[07:14.500 --> 07:17.400]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[07:17.500 --> 07:19.400]  They will be held accountable.
[07:19.500 --> 07:26.400]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[07:26.500 --> 07:28.400]  I know why you did it.
[07:28.500 --> 07:29.400]  I know you were afraid.
[07:29.500 --> 07:31.400]  Who wouldn't be?
[07:31.500 --> 07:33.400]  War, terror, disease?
[07:33.500 --> 07:40.400]  There were a myriad problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:40.400 --> 07:42.300]  Fear got the best of you.
[07:42.400 --> 07:46.300]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[07:46.400 --> 07:49.300]  He promised you order, he promised you peace.
[07:49.400 --> 07:55.300]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:55.400 --> 07:59.300]  There is a war.
[07:59.400 --> 08:03.300]  There is a war happening now.
[08:03.400 --> 08:05.300]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[08:05.400 --> 08:08.300]  The time to choose sides has come.
[08:08.300 --> 08:10.200]  We are the resistance.
[08:10.300 --> 08:19.200]  We are the Info War.
[08:19.300 --> 08:23.200]  It's Tuesday, July 19th, 2022.
[08:23.300 --> 08:33.200]  And the powers of evil and absolute darkness are making their move against humanity and the planet right now.
[08:33.200 --> 08:43.100]  But Newtonian physics and common sense and the laws of nature and God prove to us.
[08:43.200 --> 08:53.100]  Over and over again throughout history, for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.
[08:53.200 --> 08:59.100]  Evil is not the dominant force on this planet.
[08:59.100 --> 09:04.000]  But when good men and women do nothing, evil is able to take over.
[09:04.100 --> 09:11.000]  And then we are all slaves if we're even blessed enough to live.
[09:11.100 --> 09:13.000]  There is so much to cover here today.
[09:13.100 --> 09:18.000]  The Democrats are all over the news preparing to get rid of Biden.
[09:18.100 --> 09:24.000]  And having Kamala Harris go around and meet all the top donors and insert her and or Gavin Newsom.
[09:24.100 --> 09:27.000]  We have that.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.900]  We have more big developments on the major amendment brought forward by the Democratic Party leadership.
[09:32.000 --> 09:33.900]  They're trying to pass.
[09:34.000 --> 09:35.900]  It's not languishing in some committee.
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.900]  H.R. 4350 to hand dictatorial powers to the office of the presidency.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.900]  It transcends Biden and to use the military domestically against the right wing.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.900]  Close quote.
[09:50.000 --> 09:51.900]  Unbelievable.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.900]  A lot of big developments on that front.
[09:53.900 --> 10:02.800]  Then we have more and more Democrats and deep staters jumping ship and saying everyone hates us.
[10:02.900 --> 10:03.800]  No one believes us.
[10:03.900 --> 10:06.800]  Why are we doing this?
[10:06.900 --> 10:13.800]  People don't trust us MSNBC's Katie Turr wonders of legacy media doing more harm than good.
[10:13.900 --> 10:21.800]  Well, sweetheart, you're a day late at a trillion miles short.
[10:21.800 --> 10:32.700]  The only group that has a lower approval rating than Biden or Congress is the corporate establishment propaganda media.
[10:32.800 --> 10:38.700]  And they've counted on censorship and deplatforming and debanking and harassment.
[10:38.800 --> 10:43.700]  And lawsuits try to shut down the people's media.
[10:43.700 --> 10:55.600]  But the more they squeeze and the more they try to bring in their electronic iron curtain of control, the more people hunger for liberty and freedom.
[10:55.700 --> 11:05.600]  So I can say I'm extremely blessed and honored and thankful to the crew, the listeners and everybody that's helped us carry out this mission together over the years.
[11:05.600 --> 11:17.500]  We've done absolutely spectacular things because all things are possible through our Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus.
[11:17.600 --> 11:24.500]  And so I look at the work we've done and we've made mistakes and we've not been perfect, but we always have meant to tell the truth and be steadfast.
[11:24.500 --> 11:36.400]  And our record is the best there is out there for chronicling what was happening in the past, the present and predicting and projecting forward into the future.
[11:36.500 --> 11:41.400]  Now I have so much news here and a lot of times at night I'm getting ready in the morning I'm getting ready.
[11:41.500 --> 11:44.400]  I'm not sure what the main focus is going to be.
[11:44.500 --> 11:53.400]  And then once I get in here and just look at the hundreds of articles of interest they print off for me in the video clips, many of which I've sent to them.
[11:53.400 --> 11:56.300]  But many of which they found for me.
[11:56.400 --> 12:06.300]  A theme will emerge on a daily basis, sometimes a weekly or monthly basis, that just really comes into focus when you look at it all.
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.300]  Chalmer did the best job I can when we come back.
[12:10.400 --> 12:13.300]  The next few segments, it may take the rest of the hour.
[12:13.400 --> 12:17.300]  Got some big guests in studio as well, three big guests today in studio.
[12:17.300 --> 12:37.200]  But they are purposely shutting off the economy by design and all the major UN officials in all the UK and French and German and Dutch and US and Canadian.
[12:37.300 --> 12:42.200]  Prime ministers and presidents and their deputy prime ministers and vice presidents.
[12:42.300 --> 12:46.200]  I mean, I asked the crew this morning about 45 minutes for the show.
[12:46.200 --> 12:53.100]  I said, get me some clips together of the globalists admitting they're turning the power off on purpose for a great transition.
[12:53.200 --> 12:58.100]  And I had Darren McBrain doing it and he said to me before I went live, he goes, I've already got like 30 clips, how long do you want this?
[12:58.200 --> 13:01.100]  I said, just get like 15.
[13:01.100 --> 13:19.000]  So he's been looking just 30, 40 minutes, he's already got so many clips, it's making his head spin, of them laughing and giggling and snickering about how great all this is and saying pain is the point.
[13:19.100 --> 13:29.000]  And then out of the other side of their filthy line mouths, they say it's your fault and it's Russia's fault and it's the local gas station's fault and it's global warming's fault.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.900]  Then they lie about the temperatures and say it's the record ever when it's far from it.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.900]  In just the last 10 years, there's been six years that had higher temperatures on average in the Western Hemisphere.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.900]  So this is a big deal, folks.
[13:43.900 --> 14:00.800]  And I've got a stack of news and I've got nine clips in the videos section that are just unbelievable, where they just throw it in our faces and then we're putting together another compilation that's to be ready very soon.
[14:00.900 --> 14:02.800]  In fact, I don't know if McBrain's listening or watching.
[14:02.900 --> 14:04.800]  McBrain, just stop now.
[14:04.900 --> 14:05.800]  You've got enough.
[14:05.900 --> 14:07.800]  Just, in fact, just cut it down.
[14:07.800 --> 14:13.700]  I just want to be able to show people them giggling and snickering the head of the energy department, the head of transportation.
[14:13.800 --> 14:17.700]  I mean, if I just showed you Obama's people, that's who the president really is.
[14:17.800 --> 14:26.700]  If I just showed you the Obama administration that were in the third administration, the unelected administration, the dictatorship of Barack Obama and the deep state with their public Biden.
[14:26.700 --> 14:38.600]  If I just showed you the clips of them saying it, it'd be an hour of it, an hour, if we showed them like in three, four minutes in context.
[14:38.700 --> 14:41.600]  So I mean, maybe I should just fill the rest of the whole show up with it.
[14:41.700 --> 14:45.600]  But no, we'll just play five minutes of it or so coming up later in the hour.
[14:45.700 --> 14:48.600]  I think that's all I want to hear, all you want to be subject to.
[14:48.700 --> 14:49.600]  You've seen them.
[14:49.700 --> 14:50.600]  You've heard them.
[14:50.700 --> 14:51.600]  You don't need me to play it.
[14:51.600 --> 14:59.500]  The establishment, when we tell you, we're going to talk about something, we got the documents, the legislation, the video clips, all of it.
[14:59.600 --> 15:11.500]  So we're going to give you the sampling of them dancing on our collective graves, if they think, and carrying out the most ancient form of total war, siege.
[15:11.600 --> 15:12.500]  So that's coming up next segment.
[15:12.600 --> 15:14.500]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[15:14.600 --> 15:15.500]  You know who you are.
[15:15.600 --> 15:17.500]  We are in such a battle.
[15:17.600 --> 15:19.500]  We are fighting the Democratic Party at point blank range.
[15:19.500 --> 15:23.400]  I have three show trials that are completely rigged or I've been found guilty by the judges.
[15:23.500 --> 15:30.400]  And then the jury decides how guilty we have rulings by the Texas judge that I can't talk about it being a show trial or the First Amendment.
[15:30.500 --> 15:32.400]  I have to say I'm guilty.
[15:32.500 --> 15:37.400]  And then if I don't come, they'll then do million dollar fines.
[15:37.500 --> 15:41.400]  We paid a million dollar fine yesterday to the court.
[15:41.500 --> 15:43.400]  We're not allowed to talk about that to the jury.
[15:43.500 --> 15:44.400]  You're like, that sounds crazy.
[15:44.500 --> 15:47.400]  Well, it's the same court that indicted Rick Perry for no reason or Tom Delay.
[15:47.500 --> 15:48.400]  It's the same group.
[15:48.400 --> 15:49.300]  You ask why I live here.
[15:49.400 --> 15:50.300]  It's where I'm from.
[15:50.400 --> 15:51.300]  I've had it all to do over again.
[15:51.400 --> 15:53.300]  I would have set him for wars up somewhere else.
[15:53.400 --> 16:00.300]  But that's the level of attack we're under by these criminals.
[16:00.400 --> 16:08.300]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships to annihilate the family to split up marriages.
[16:08.300 --> 16:18.200]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[16:18.300 --> 16:20.200]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:20.300 --> 16:25.200]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us one for another do.
[16:25.300 --> 16:26.200]  That's just the truth.
[16:26.300 --> 16:28.200]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[17:10.100 --> 17:21.000]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with, and we said, what are the bestselling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[17:21.100 --> 17:27.000]  We went and looked at the top 10, and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[17:27.000 --> 17:39.900]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body.
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.900]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.900]  I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months, and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[17:47.900 --> 17:58.800]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, 40% off. InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.

[18:37.800 --> 18:39.700]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[18:39.700 --> 18:44.600]  Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75% off.
[18:44.700 --> 18:46.600]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[18:46.700 --> 18:50.600]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[18:50.700 --> 18:52.600]  Quite well, I might add.
[18:52.700 --> 18:56.600]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[18:56.700 --> 18:58.600]  I go and see him quite often now.
[18:58.700 --> 19:05.600]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items at InfoWarsStore.com, all the storable food.

[19:30.600 --> 19:34.500]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse. They have designed this.

[19:59.400 --> 20:06.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.400 --> 20:20.300]  Back with a keen time for a vote on the Green New Deal.
[20:20.300 --> 20:31.200]  Even her co-sponsor, the other guy who wrote it, the super woke senator from Massachusetts, voted present, not in favor.
[20:31.300 --> 20:34.200]  Now, why is that? Why did nobody actually support it?
[20:34.300 --> 20:43.200]  Well, because if you think cow flacculence is even in the top 200 top issues for most Americans, you're Sandy Cortez.
[20:43.300 --> 20:45.200]  Go back to queer theory class.
[20:45.300 --> 20:48.200]  Get rid of fossil fuels? Yeah, what then?
[20:48.200 --> 20:51.100]  Well, starvation, poverty, societal collapse.
[20:51.200 --> 20:54.100]  Voters, it turns out, are not into any of those things.
[20:54.200 --> 20:58.100]  Three years ago, Ghana was in great shape and had one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
[20:58.200 --> 21:04.100]  In fact, it had so much energy over most of the last decade, it was exporting it to its neighbors in West Africa.
[21:04.200 --> 21:08.100]  Now, those energy exports from Ghana peaked in 2014.
[21:08.200 --> 21:14.100]  Why that year? Well, because the next year, the World Bank published this headline on its website.
[21:14.100 --> 21:20.000]  World Bank approves largest ever guarantees for Ghana's energy transformation.
[21:20.100 --> 21:25.000]  When they promised to transform your energy, slow down.
[21:25.100 --> 21:27.000]  But Ghana didn't slow down. They just kept going.
[21:27.100 --> 21:29.000]  This is the part you don't read that much about.
[21:29.100 --> 21:33.000]  Last year, Ghana experienced a complete shutdown of its national power supply.
[21:33.100 --> 21:38.000]  Oh, no more electricity. No emissions because we have no electricity.
[21:38.000 --> 21:44.900]  International observers say the country is now facing severe food shortages and hunger, starvation within a matter of months.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.900]  In 2016, the World Economic Forum published an article by a Columbia professor called Joseph Stiglitz,
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.900]  one of the dumbest people on planet Earth, urging Ghana to transition to, quote,
[21:55.000 --> 21:56.900]  high productivity organic farming.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.900]  Now, what does Stiglitz do all about farming? Ever farmed?
[22:00.000 --> 22:00.900]  No.
[22:01.000 --> 22:04.900]  But he felt strongly that Sri Lanka should try a new kind of farming,
[22:04.900 --> 22:07.800]  and of course sold it to Sri Lankans as a pathway to prosperity.
[22:07.900 --> 22:12.800]  In 2015, the World Economic Forum published an article on its website entitled the recording,
[22:12.900 --> 22:16.800]  this is how we will make Sri Lanka rich by 2025.
[22:16.900 --> 22:20.800]  You can search for that article, but it's gone now along with the government of Sri Lanka.
[22:20.900 --> 22:27.800]  That's really what the World Economic Forum and the United Nations is after here is controlling humans.
[22:27.900 --> 22:33.800]  Man, they're playing with fire and they will get actual revolutions if they mess with energy. That is true.
[22:33.800 --> 22:39.700]  An angrier world? You will own nothing and have nothing? You will eat the bugs?
[22:39.800 --> 22:46.700]  That's the whole plan, is to have an angrier world and a collapsed third world that floods the first world collapsing us.
[22:46.800 --> 22:53.700]  Coming up next segment, I've got a small compilation, because you can only pick so much at the hours long,
[22:53.800 --> 22:56.700]  of world leaders and others saying, we're doing this on purpose, cutting your energy off,
[22:56.700 --> 23:03.600]  but now that it's all happening, they go, oh, it was the virus and it was the lockdowns we had to do,
[23:03.700 --> 23:07.600]  which again, the UN now estimates, and these are accurate numbers I've looked into them,
[23:07.700 --> 23:14.600]  probably low actually, if anything, 60 plus million extra people starved to death in the last 30 plus months
[23:14.700 --> 23:18.600]  since these lockdowns went on, because in areas of Africa and Latin America and Asia,
[23:18.700 --> 23:22.600]  the lockdowns are still going on.
[23:22.600 --> 23:27.500]  For small farms and small businesses, they just turn your power off, they just come and take your cows,
[23:27.600 --> 23:30.500]  they come and take everything, they take your property, they don't like it, they line you up and shoot you,
[23:30.600 --> 23:32.500]  you just go home and starve to death.
[23:32.600 --> 23:35.500]  To save the earth, this is the global depopulation.
[23:35.600 --> 23:44.500]  When the UN and the Club of Rome and DeboScript say they want a 90% depopulation by the year 2030 through Agenda 2030,
[23:44.600 --> 23:51.500]  Agenda 21 was just setting the table for this murderous feast.
[23:51.500 --> 23:57.400]  And now we're here, and they said during the lockdowns, this is good for the earth, this is good for the climate.
[23:57.500 --> 24:08.400]  Now the national average in the Netherlands, which is the case point example of the same things happening in France and the UK and everywhere else,
[24:08.500 --> 24:16.400]  is 30% of the cows have to be killed this year because they put off methane and nitrogen that they say is toxic waste when it's part of the life cycle.
[24:16.500 --> 24:19.400]  They're listing what animals put off as toxic,
[24:19.400 --> 24:29.300]  but many Dutch farmers, you can look it up, type in the headline, must kill 93% of their cows, particularly dairy cows.
[24:29.400 --> 24:38.300]  They say put off even more nitrogen because their manure is so rich, and then it's used for fertilizer, how horrible.
[24:38.400 --> 24:44.300]  And anywhere they run off from natural cow pastures, runs into streams and rivers, it creates incredible life.
[24:44.300 --> 24:50.200]  That's the life cycle, we think the Nile is so rich with all of the cows that live in it.
[24:50.300 --> 24:56.200]  They're wild cows, they're called buffalo, water buffalo, millions of them, millions, millions, are they bad farting?
[24:56.300 --> 24:59.200]  Are they bad pooping in the water like the hippopotamuses?
[24:59.300 --> 25:11.200]  That are basically the equivalent of gigantic cows five times the size of a cow that live half their lives during the day in the water eating the reeds.
[25:11.200 --> 25:19.100]  And they get out and eat the grass. Are they bad pooping in the water, too?
[25:19.200 --> 25:28.100]  Why do you catch all your fish coming out of the Mississippi Delta into the Gulf of Mexico?
[25:28.200 --> 25:30.100]  Why is that where all the fish and all the shrimp are?
[25:30.200 --> 25:36.100]  Because there's all that poop coming down the river.
[25:36.200 --> 25:40.100]  Is toxic waste good? Is the Prozac and Ritalin running off good? No, in fact it's affecting the fish.
[25:40.100 --> 25:46.000]  It's affecting the shrimp, making them suicidal, where they don't care if they get killed by other animals.
[25:46.100 --> 25:48.000]  Look it up, I'm not joking.
[25:48.100 --> 25:57.000]  Run off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors of SSRIs, pausing shrimp and fish to be suicidal.
[25:57.100 --> 26:00.000]  Look, none of this sounds real, it's all real.
[26:00.100 --> 26:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[26:07.000 --> 26:11.900]  Here is a Dutch farmer laying out in English what's really happening and why they're fighting back.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.900]  Imagine, oh, 93% of your cows must be killed in the next six months. Here it is.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.900]  That's probably, on this moment, the main cause of it all.
[26:21.000 --> 26:25.900]  We're not talking about nitrogen, they just want to reduce the national herd.
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.900]  Well, every farmer all around the world and also every citizen knows that cutting back the herd isn't the cause of any problems.
[26:33.900 --> 26:40.800]  You know, we are producing food, two-thirds of agricultural land on the planet can only be grown by grass
[26:40.900 --> 26:48.800]  and you need cows like this for making grass into meat or into milk or whatever you want.
[26:48.900 --> 26:55.800]  Whatever problem with emissions, with pollution on the world you are asking about, whether it's not chemical,
[26:55.800 --> 27:03.700]  but farming is probably a part of the problem, but most of it all is part of the solution.
[27:03.800 --> 27:10.700]  Well, Dutch farmers now are getting angry every day more, government is not listening
[27:10.800 --> 27:17.700]  and what we are fearing for is we have to leave our land and that's also a deeper agenda behind it.
[27:17.700 --> 27:26.600]  In Holland they just want to have farmer's land, 62% of the area in Holland is farmed by farmers
[27:26.700 --> 27:32.600]  and what they want to do is they want to have the land cheap so they're making it nature first
[27:32.700 --> 27:36.600]  and when they have the land in their hands they can build houses on it.
[27:36.700 --> 27:44.600]  Houses we don't need by Dutch citizens because average Dutch couple is getting 1.8, 1.9 kids
[27:44.600 --> 27:53.500]  so what's the problem of the demand for houses that we get 100,000 refugees in this country every year?
[27:53.600 --> 27:59.500]  That's why they have to build houses. Well, that's a shortcut of our problems right now.
[27:59.600 --> 28:03.500]  Farmers are getting angry, they're not listened by by the government.
[28:03.600 --> 28:11.500]  Every solution we came on with, they don't take it and what we see right now when we have to reduce
[28:11.500 --> 28:16.400]  our national hurt, when we have to reduce our hurts by ourselves, farms will break down.
[28:16.500 --> 28:22.400]  On this moment when the plan of the government is coming through, probably 30, 40, 50% of the farmers
[28:22.500 --> 28:29.400]  have to fear for the future. That's why we're on the streets, that's why we're protesting.
[28:29.500 --> 28:35.400]  This fellow is 90% there, so they're not trying to fix the problem, it's a takeover by design.
[28:35.400 --> 28:42.300]  On screen is where they stick tubes up the cow's butts or into the side of their stomachs
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.300]  because their methane is bad and they make them capture the methane torturing the animals claiming it's toxic.
[28:47.400 --> 28:52.300]  It's part of the damn atmosphere. This is a design worldwide collapse, you've seen it in Sri Lanka,
[28:52.400 --> 28:59.300]  you've seen it everywhere else and now it's here. I told you they banned the beef and now they're doing it.

[33:57.100 --> 34:04.000]  Sixty plus million people extra on top of the 15 million on average a year that starved to death around the world.
[34:04.100 --> 34:11.000]  The last few years an extra 20 million people every year, the last two and a half years have been killed.
[34:11.000 --> 34:18.900]  Directly by the policies of the technocrats with their AI computers and systems, they know exactly what's going to happen, they admit that and they're doing it.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.900]  It's part of this beautiful transition.
[34:22.000 --> 34:35.900]  When you watch the Davos group meetings that are going on every month or so, what we are doing is so beautiful, what the people are mad and what do we do to stop them while we save the earth?
[34:35.900 --> 34:40.800]  They're going to make them angry, that angrieness will collapse and faster.
[34:40.900 --> 34:42.800]  They will eat some bugs.
[34:42.900 --> 34:47.800]  We're going to substand the cows first and then everything else.
[34:47.900 --> 34:49.800]  This is a culling.
[34:49.900 --> 34:51.800]  That's what the UN says they do.
[34:51.900 --> 34:56.800]  We just sit here wondering why they're doing all this, why it's happening.
[34:56.900 --> 34:58.800]  Here's some of the headlines.
[34:58.900 --> 35:00.800]  Here's Samantha Powers.
[35:00.800 --> 35:09.700]  That's the former U.S. Ambassador to the UN, the UN must act on climate change to revert global food catastrophe.
[35:09.800 --> 35:19.700]  So she's at U.S. aid now giving speeches that, oh, climate change is causing everybody to starve to death, not the lockdowns they put in place.
[35:19.800 --> 35:20.700]  Pain is the point.
[35:20.800 --> 35:25.700]  White House vows to accelerate devastating energy transition.
[35:25.800 --> 35:27.700]  There's a viral video out there.
[35:27.700 --> 35:32.600]  It's on infowars.com, Saudis pay half the amount Americans do for gas.
[35:32.700 --> 35:36.600]  They pay $2.33 for premium.
[35:36.700 --> 35:39.600]  They get $95 octane.
[35:39.700 --> 35:41.600]  And they pay $2.18.
[35:41.700 --> 35:55.600]  But if you translate their currency, that's $0.62 for premium and about $0.59 for regular.
[35:55.600 --> 36:03.500]  Because their government wants a lot of people to be alive, pays their folks to have children because they want Islam to take over.
[36:03.600 --> 36:06.500]  They understand a strong country has people.
[36:06.600 --> 36:17.500]  And if you're an industrialized nation, you need each man and woman to have 2.3 children to just stay at the same rate.
[36:17.500 --> 36:29.400]  And as more and more people don't have children, the actuary show in many areas like Italy and Japan, folks need to have 4 children just to keep it up because almost no one's having children.
[36:29.500 --> 36:36.400]  But Japan has a 1.3 replacement rate and so does Italy.
[36:36.500 --> 36:38.400]  Germany has a 1.5.
[36:38.500 --> 36:40.400]  The UK a 1.6.
[36:40.500 --> 36:43.400]  The U.S. a 1.8.
[36:43.500 --> 36:44.400]  Elon Musk has done the math.
[36:44.500 --> 36:45.400]  We've done the math.
[36:45.400 --> 36:47.300]  We've covered it for decades.
[36:47.400 --> 36:50.300]  You don't have 2.3 children, civilization collapses.
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.300]  It's hard to build civilization.
[36:52.400 --> 36:57.300]  It's easier to wreck it and then poses the saviors for the crisis that's unfolding.
[36:57.400 --> 37:00.300]  So everything we see is the great reset.
[37:00.400 --> 37:05.300]  It's the big central issue.
[37:05.400 --> 37:13.300]  Continuing, government-run cooling centers crop up across the nation as rolling blackouts impose in certain areas.
[37:13.300 --> 37:16.200]  But don't worry, the government still has air conditioning.
[37:16.300 --> 37:19.200]  You can come there and live in a camp.
[37:19.300 --> 37:21.200]  They lock you up at night.
[37:21.300 --> 37:23.200]  I'm not kidding.
[37:23.300 --> 37:35.200]  You can come to the FEMA camp and get air conditioning and now in Germany they've announced heating centers because you won't be getting electricity during the winter.
[37:35.300 --> 37:40.200]  But the government will, you can go stay in a government sports stadium.
[37:40.200 --> 37:46.100]  California has turned off all the major reservoirs claiming that it's going to hurt endangered fish that aren't even endangered.
[37:46.200 --> 37:53.100]  They've been doing that for five years and now what's the California turning into a desert?
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.100]  And the crime rate is exploding as the police are defunded and the system stands down.
[37:59.200 --> 38:01.100]  This is a designed operation.
[38:01.200 --> 38:03.100]  So let's play back to back.
[38:03.200 --> 38:08.100]  This latest clip of Samantha Power, one of Obama's favorite people, just came out and said,
[38:08.100 --> 38:12.000]  the U.S. must act on climate to avert global food catastrophe.
[38:12.100 --> 38:20.000]  Well, they're the one's engineering and then we'll go into that short compilation of deep state Democrats and others admitting it's a transition.
[38:20.100 --> 38:22.000]  They could cut the energy costs.
[38:22.100 --> 38:28.000]  They could not have rolling blackouts, but they've ordered the power plants not to produce the power.
[38:28.100 --> 38:33.000]  The Supreme Court said two weeks ago they can't do that, but notice they don't care and Biden says he doesn't care.
[38:33.100 --> 38:35.000]  Obama says he doesn't care.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.900]  So here are those clips back to back.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.900]  Today we are in a global food crisis.
[38:43.000 --> 38:43.900]  No question.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.900]  What can we do together to avert a global food catastrophe?
[38:51.000 --> 39:02.900]  To start, we have to understand the forces that have led us to this current precipice, the most existential of which is climate change.
[39:02.900 --> 39:14.800]  Each day seems to bring a new report of climate catastrophes like the brutal heat waves we're seeing in Texas, the wildfires tearing through Europe,
[39:14.900 --> 39:21.800]  or the parts of the United Kingdom receiving red alert heat warnings for the first time in their history.
[39:21.900 --> 39:29.800]  But it turns out the biggest threat climate change poses to the world's hungry isn't a sudden shock.
[39:29.800 --> 39:38.700]  It is a long sustained onslaught, droughts that don't just last for a season but for years.
[39:38.800 --> 39:41.700]  You may have noticed this week that your gas prices have gone up.
[39:41.800 --> 39:43.700]  I want to talk to you a little bit about why.
[39:43.800 --> 39:45.700]  A lot of it has to do with Vladimir Putin.
[39:45.800 --> 39:47.700]  But part of this is on the oil companies.
[39:47.700 --> 40:07.600]  Right now there are 9,000 approved unused permits that oil and gas companies could tap into now to ramp up production.
[40:07.700 --> 40:11.600]  The White House even coming up with a cute little hashtag, Putin price hike.
[40:11.600 --> 40:19.500]  Joe Biden insisting the surge is all Putin's fault but take a look at this, prices, they've been skyrocketing ever since Biden took office.
[40:19.600 --> 40:25.500]  Today, the average gas price in America hit an all-time record high of over $4 per gallon.
[40:25.600 --> 40:31.500]  I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon. Hell, I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.
[40:31.600 --> 40:35.500]  Perhaps if you let the market work in this respect, people will feel pain.
[40:35.600 --> 40:39.500]  They'll take a second look at that Ford F-450 Gigantoy truck.
[40:39.500 --> 40:42.400]  They'll reconsider a Tesla, you'll see hybrid innovation.
[40:42.500 --> 40:49.400]  We should ultimately learn our lesson here and become energy independent and choose to invest in clean domestic energy.
[40:49.500 --> 40:52.400]  We have to move to clean energy solutions.
[40:52.500 --> 40:56.400]  Clean is in the end where we should be so that we don't find ourselves in this position again.
[40:56.500 --> 41:06.400]  So it's about making a choice between what is the short term and the medium term so that we can make sure we have enough oil and gas to support us through the transition.
[41:06.400 --> 41:20.300]  And what are the kind of steps that we don't want the oil and gas industry to take that would have long term consequences when we don't want new major projects that would take 20, 30 years to become profitable.
[41:20.400 --> 41:29.300]  So we have to make that differentiation to make sure that the American consumer has what it needs to grow our economy and the global economy.
[41:29.300 --> 41:38.200]  But not take steps and endanger the climate work that we're trying to do to make sure that we're in a better footing to accelerate the transition.
[41:38.300 --> 41:57.200]  What we're saying is in the same way that natural gas has replaced a lot of coal-fired plants, well let's see if we can get that same kind of progress on solar and wind and hydro and other clean energies that are sustainable over the long term.
[41:57.200 --> 42:05.100]  At the heart of his plan, coal-fired power plants. For the first time, Obama aims to cap how much heat trapping gas they produce.
[42:05.200 --> 42:17.100]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-fired plant, they can. It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[42:17.100 --> 42:27.000]  Gas prices surging a record high $4.59. But President Biden says the U.S. is simply going through a transition towards greener options. Watch this.
[42:27.100 --> 42:43.000]  And when it comes to the gas prices, we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that God willing when it's over we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger unless we lie in on fossil fuels when this is over.
[42:43.100 --> 42:44.000]  Alright.
[42:44.100 --> 42:45.000]  This is going to be a haul.
[42:45.000 --> 42:53.900]  So we have hundreds more clips than saying it. We have the U.N. doing the worldwide lockdown. We have them engineering the whole collapse and now they're the saviors saying do whatever they say or you'll starve to death.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.900]  You do what they say, they then starve you to death. We're held hostage by murdering criminals.
[42:58.900 --> 43:17.800]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages. And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[43:17.800 --> 43:30.700]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth. The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true. But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis,
[43:30.800 --> 43:40.700]  InstaHeart is the number one best selling natural herbal supplement in the world when it comes to male enhancement because it really works. It also gives you a ton of energy.

[44:48.500 --> 44:57.400]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil. Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products infoorstore.com.
[45:36.400 --> 45:45.400]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[45:45.400 --> 45:58.300]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infoorstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[45:58.400 --> 46:12.300]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas. And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[46:12.300 --> 46:28.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism and turn that clock back by turning up your metabolism.

[47:21.000 --> 47:35.000]  The economies of the world are being purposely turned off. The public is being told to not have hope in themselves or their nations or their God, but to have faith in the UN to save them.
[47:35.000 --> 47:48.900]  But on record, every time the megacorporations that created and run the UN and the whole Rothschild Rockefeller project of world government is the author of our doom.
[47:48.900 --> 48:10.800]  We've got a lot more on this to cover, and then Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is going to cover the inside baseball and election fraud, the latest COVID cases with Pfizer whistleblowers that he's brought with Robert Kennedy Jr., proving they knew it was killing people and didn't protect them, and the attack on free speech and more of Robert Barnes' studio.
[48:10.800 --> 48:35.700]  And then we have several other very informative guests in studio. I'll tell you about next hour in the third hour today. Let me do this right now. It's a very complex issue, but there is an attack on free speech and an attempt to take info wars off the year.
[48:35.700 --> 48:47.600]  And we've done the calculations. We've done the numbers. What will stop them and what will defeat them and what has stopped them in the last four years in their attempts has been you in your word of mouth, your prayers, your financial support.
[48:47.700 --> 48:55.600]  And next hour we'll get some into this and give you some breaking news and some shocking information. When I say shocking, I mean, believe me, this is unbelievable information.
[48:55.600 --> 49:06.500]  That's coming up next hour. And more on the martial law legislation, HR 4350 added the National Defense Authorization Act. That's coming up as well. Big hour next hour.
[49:06.600 --> 49:18.500]  But listeners continue to come through, and we are nip and tuck. This is like a football game or a basketball game that just stays tied right to the end. That's how God runs things.
[49:18.500 --> 49:26.400]  God wants to see us put in our maximum effort. We have great products that are amazing. It will change your life and that support this broadcast.
[49:26.500 --> 49:34.400]  And so it's really a symbiotic win-win situation. And I want to again thank you all for what you've done in your support.
[49:34.500 --> 49:43.400]  We have a lot of great items that have been sold out or new items that are now in the store, like the cavalry coming over the hill right at the last minute.
[49:43.400 --> 49:52.300]  It's a godsend. And like I said, we've got 15 products in the next four months coming in that have been back-ordered. We had problems. We spent everything we had to get those coming in.
[49:52.400 --> 50:02.300]  Every week or so, another product comes in and with past performance with you taking action and getting these products, we will have plenty of money within two months.
[50:02.400 --> 50:09.300]  And I won't be up here firing the batch signal. But right now, we are completely and totally maxed out.
[50:09.300 --> 50:20.200]  I have spent almost everything I've got. We have to leave a half million dollars in the operating account just to pay the employees and pay for all of the expenses as they come in.
[50:20.300 --> 50:28.200]  So we are on fumes right now, but we almost went out of fumes yesterday because this new product came in.
[50:28.300 --> 50:33.200]  And in a few days, we won't be in fumes. We'll just be on E and we'll climb out of this together.
[50:33.200 --> 50:40.100]  So you know who you are that went to m4warstore.com yesterday and got the new product, Diet Force.

[51:50.900 --> 52:04.800]  A major theater in Austin is having the premiere in Texas of Alex's War. It's been number two on the Apple pre-order charts only behind Top Gun for now a week.
[52:04.800 --> 52:09.700]  That is sending it to number one on many other charts. Amazing that that's happening.
[52:09.800 --> 52:17.700]  And journalist Glenn Greenwald came out in Defense of the Film and in Defense of Free Speech and he will be at the event this Saturday.
[52:17.800 --> 52:28.700]  I'll be interviewing him. He'll be interviewing me and Alex Lee Morrier. That is this Saturday and then on the 29th it will hit theaters in select cities across the United States.
[52:28.700 --> 52:35.600]  But we have the DVD. We'll say, well, that's old technology. Well, that gets around sensors. And so we have the DVD.
[52:35.700 --> 52:43.600]  A limited supply is going to be arriving on Friday. It will be shipping out on the 29th of July.
[52:43.700 --> 52:54.600]  So we want to support the broadcast and have this film that's already award-winning that really chronicles our 28 years on air and brought tears to my eyes and counters the lies of the New World Order.
[52:54.600 --> 53:03.500]  Alex's War on DVD exclusively available at infowarstore.com and now available for pre-order on streaming services everywhere.
[53:03.600 --> 53:10.500]  The only money we make off this film is the money from the DVD sales and soon it will be sold basically everywhere.

[53:24.500 --> 53:32.400]  Mexican President urges Biden to drop charges against Julian Assange. You know, I don't like his socialism policies, but I like his straight talk.
[53:32.500 --> 53:38.400]  I'm saying we have a failed border in more and he's absolutely right. Shame on Trump, shame on Biden, but they've done to Julian Assange a true hero.
[53:38.400 --> 53:47.300]  As persecuted as I am, look at Julian Assange and I realize that I'm blessed to not be in the position he's in though they're trying to do that to all of us.
[53:47.400 --> 53:55.300]  And Google and Facebook have been censoring any mention of Alex's War, so let's help override them and send the film to number one.

[54:41.200 --> 54:49.100]  Okay, you know, we should do whole reports on this, and I've talked about it in the last week, but it's really getting people's attention.
[54:49.100 --> 55:01.000]  There's a lot of videos out there where they show the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, all of it, and show the temperature way hotter in the UK and the US than the news is saying.
[55:01.100 --> 55:10.000]  So the weather people get up there and they lie to you and say, record temperatures in Texas, record temperatures in Nebraska,
[55:10.100 --> 55:13.000]  record temperatures in London, but here is just a screenshot.
[55:13.100 --> 55:18.000]  You can go look this up for the hottest UK summers.
[55:18.000 --> 55:45.900]  And again, this is in the other system of temperature, Celsius, 1911, 36.7, 1923, 34.4, 1932, 35.6, 1933, 34.4, 1996, 35.6, 1990, 37.1, 1995, 35.2, 2003, 38.5, 2006, 35.7, 2016, 34.4.
[55:45.900 --> 55:54.800]  And it cut off some of the numbers here, but it's 33 to 33.9 right now at the hottest temperatures.
[55:54.900 --> 55:59.800]  So all these numbers are way higher than what they're currently showing.
[55:59.900 --> 56:05.800]  And yesterday we showed you, again, newscasts from the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s versus this.
[56:05.900 --> 56:07.800]  There's a lot of other great compilations out there.
[56:07.900 --> 56:13.800]  In fact, maybe some of the crew get some of those compilations together because they're all just like 30 seconds long and put them together.
[56:13.800 --> 56:18.700]  They're like a three, four minute one that just really brings this home, how they're lying to you.
[56:18.800 --> 56:27.700]  And I've got another example of this we'll get to later, where in Hawaii yesterday, a 20 foot wave came in.
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.700]  Now they got signs all over the beach saying, watch out for rogue waves.
[56:31.800 --> 56:32.700]  They hit all the time.
[56:32.800 --> 56:37.700]  You'll be a mile in shore and it says, this is a tsunami evacuation route.
[56:37.800 --> 56:38.700]  The sea levels are the same.
[56:38.800 --> 56:39.700]  They are today.
[56:39.800 --> 56:40.700]  They were 100 years ago.
[56:40.800 --> 56:41.700]  That's just mainline science.
[56:41.700 --> 56:45.600]  Plymouth Rock is at the same level it was 400 years ago.
[56:45.700 --> 56:48.600]  And I've got the graphics on that.
[56:48.700 --> 56:55.600]  But a wave comes in and goes over the little seawall while folks are having a party and the left says, this is global warming.
[56:55.700 --> 56:57.600]  You'll all be dead soon.
[56:57.700 --> 57:03.600]  Really, that doesn't stop Obama and all the globalists from buying houses the last 30 years right on the beach,
[57:03.700 --> 57:05.600]  including just recently.
[57:05.700 --> 57:08.600]  Absolute crap.
[57:08.600 --> 57:12.500]  That's why beach houses are on stilts.
[57:12.600 --> 57:18.500]  Because routinely in storms or rogue waves that form out in the Pacific Atlantic, this happens.
[57:18.600 --> 57:22.500]  But that's how stupid they think all of us are.
[57:22.600 --> 57:24.500]  But we're still here to challenge their lies.
[57:24.600 --> 57:30.500]  Only way they're gaslighting succeed, they admit, is they can shut down all of the debate.
[57:30.600 --> 57:32.500]  And it gets even more insane next hour.
[57:32.500 --> 57:41.400]  Robert Barnes, mainline universities are saying that scientists can no longer, even archaeologists, identify male from female skeletons.
[57:41.500 --> 57:43.400]  They're telling police departments they can't do it either.
[57:43.400 --> 58:13.300]  This is a cult of control.

[58:49.300 --> 58:53.200]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[58:53.300 --> 59:00.200]  That supplies the highest quality signature reducing faraday cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government agencies.
[59:00.200 --> 59:08.100]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made in America, onion line at a very affordable price.
[59:08.200 --> 59:19.100]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads or big bags that promote whatever electrons you want to put in it like desktop computers.
[59:19.200 --> 59:25.100]  It is all exclusively available at infowarstore.com under the Redux name.
[59:25.100 --> 59:32.000]  Redux is info wars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at infowarstore.com.
[59:32.100 --> 59:42.000]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[59:42.000 --> 59:58.900]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that is exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.900]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:28.900]  Good evening everybody, it may be time to declare war outright against the deep state and clear out the rot in the upper levels of the FBI and the Justice Department.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:33.900]  The media is rushing to slander and discredit those of us that are exposing this.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.900]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up, this isn't a game.
[1:00:37.900 --> 1:00:46.800]  There are new concerns that Trump FBI officials formed even a secret society at the FBI subvert the president after his election.
[1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:51.800]  So let's stop there, a secret society, a secret meetings offside of the Justice Department.
[1:00:51.900 --> 1:00:54.800]  Correct, really secret societies, you can't make this stuff up.
[1:00:54.900 --> 1:01:00.800]  Let me give you one bottom line, as a former government official, government's going to kill this guy.
[1:01:00.900 --> 1:01:05.800]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:08.700]  It's one giant incestuous circle of corruption.
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:10.700]  Look, the CIA is a rogue agency.
[1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.700]  The White House and the president are citing simple wars.
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:18.700]  We have to start getting ready for insurrection and civil war because they're really pushing it.
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:27.700]  What are we going to do if they kill the president and then order their local governments and their local federal branches to come arrest thousands of resistance leaders?
[1:01:27.800 --> 1:01:34.700]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[1:01:34.700 --> 1:01:37.600]  This is a FEMA high-level emergency.
[1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:41.600]  This is a national emergency, and better instructions will follow.
[1:01:41.700 --> 1:01:43.600]  We are at the top level.
[1:01:43.700 --> 1:01:45.600]  We are at the top level.
[1:01:45.700 --> 1:01:47.600]  We are at the top level.
[1:01:47.700 --> 1:01:49.600]  We are at the top level.
[1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:50.600]  We are high.
[1:01:50.700 --> 1:01:51.600]  We mean calm.
[1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:54.600]  Go indoors immediately and stay indoors.
[1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:56.600]  This is an emergency broadcast from FEMA.
[1:01:56.700 --> 1:02:03.600]  In compliance with the United Nations, the Department of Homeland Security has declared more civil war.
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:05.500]  City officials have called for military help.
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.500]  Planes and troops are expected to arrive within the next two hours.
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:19.500]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:36.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:02:40.500 --> 1:02:44.400]  I'm here to say, and this is the reason why I came to see you, Alex,
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:51.300]  you are one of the very few who are operating under this theory to be an independent American.
[1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:57.300]  In a big way, if you're calling it media fine, if you're calling it sports, whatever it is,
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:00.300]  but you've got to be the greatest you can be now.
[1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:07.300]  I don't know why they've been successful in pushing everybody into these little ghettos of these Facebooks
[1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:11.300]  and these tweets and these Instagrams, these Instas.
[1:03:11.400 --> 1:03:13.300]  This is ghetto.
[1:03:13.300 --> 1:03:15.200]  This is ghetto. This is corporate.
[1:03:15.300 --> 1:03:18.200]  They're taking your energy.
[1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:21.200]  They're taking your energy and you're getting nothing in return, nothing.
[1:03:21.300 --> 1:03:22.200]  They're dumbing the language down.
[1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:26.200]  Twitter's designed to reduce the language directly out of 1984.
[1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:27.200]  It's Ingsoc.
[1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:31.200]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[1:03:31.300 --> 1:03:32.200]  I said, Matt, it's over for you.
[1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:35.200]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:36.200]  You're out of there.
[1:03:36.300 --> 1:03:38.200]  They're going to make it so headlines you can't even use headlines.
[1:03:38.300 --> 1:03:42.200]  To have a Supreme Court justice say that to my face that it's over.
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:45.100]  They've got the votes, which means time is limited.
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.100]  Time is not forever.
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:52.100]  How many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life rise and fall?
[1:03:52.200 --> 1:03:53.100]  There's not that many.
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.100]  It's a small amount.
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:01.100]  So for people to be saying with this attitude, oh, I'll get on with my life and my greatness sometime.
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:02.100]  No, no, you can't.
[1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:04.100]  We're being enslaved now and that's it.
[1:04:04.200 --> 1:04:09.100]  Under the TPP, they admit you can't put a headline to the New York Times.
[1:04:09.100 --> 1:04:12.000]  You're sending massive traffic to them.
[1:04:12.100 --> 1:04:14.000]  They're claiming you're taking their words.
[1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:15.000]  This is insane.
[1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:19.000]  And you had the justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at a global law now.
[1:04:19.100 --> 1:04:21.000]  Remember just recently getting lined up with it.
[1:04:21.100 --> 1:04:24.000]  So they're getting ready for these decisions to come.
[1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:26.000]  You thought Obamacare was shocking.
[1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.000]  You thought some of these other decisions were shocking.
[1:04:28.100 --> 1:04:31.000]  Wait until these copyright laws work their way up.
[1:04:31.100 --> 1:04:37.000]  And the Supreme Court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.900]  linking across the board.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.900]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:49.900]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.900]  Sold out for seven months.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:05.900]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.
[1:05:05.900 --> 1:05:10.800]  Turmeric's been known for thousands of years to do amazing things for your joints,
[1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:13.800]  for your stamina, for your immune system, for your libido.
[1:05:13.900 --> 1:05:18.800]  And look, the average type of the shelves is five, six, seven percent of your humanoid.
[1:05:18.900 --> 1:05:21.800]  We have the strongest brand on earth.
[1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:23.800]  Nobody else decided to do it.
[1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:26.800]  It's 95% of your humanoid at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:31.800]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% of your humanoid.
[1:05:31.800 --> 1:05:37.700]  It is incredible, and what's even more incredible is it funds the Info War.
[1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:41.700]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today
[1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:45.700]  and ordering Body's ultimate turmeric formula at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.700]  It is simply amazing.
[1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:53.700]  Discover the power of your humanoids at 95% at InfoWarStore.com today
[1:05:53.700 --> 1:06:02.600]  with Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[1:06:17.700 --> 1:06:19.600]  We are drugged out.
[1:06:19.700 --> 1:06:22.600]  We are following other people's opinions.
[1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:25.500]  We are controlled by the media.
[1:06:25.600 --> 1:06:27.500]  Today it all changes.
[1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:30.500]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[1:06:30.600 --> 1:06:33.500]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:38.500]  Einstein says the depth of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[1:06:38.600 --> 1:06:41.500]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:43.500]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.500]  Why don't we just try love?
[1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:47.500]  Why don't we just try love?
[1:06:47.600 --> 1:06:51.500]  We have the resources for a peaceful world.
[1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:55.400]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[1:06:55.500 --> 1:06:57.400]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[1:06:57.500 --> 1:06:59.400]  Now we all know Steve Jobs phones.
[1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:00.400]  They say Trump's crazy.
[1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:01.400]  They say I'm crazy.
[1:07:01.500 --> 1:07:03.400]  But I'm here to show love.
[1:07:03.500 --> 1:07:08.400]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[1:07:08.500 --> 1:07:12.400]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:21.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:26.300]  So it is quickly becoming illegal to point out that men are not women, no matter how they dress,
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:30.300]  no matter what kind of shoes they have, no matter what they paint their nails.
[1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:37.300]  So this is an attack not just on biology, but on speech, on conscience.
[1:07:37.400 --> 1:07:39.300]  You're not allowed to say obvious things.
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:40.300]  Here's an example.
[1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:47.200]  A self-described feminist in Norway called Christina Ellingsen is facing a three-year sentence in prison.
[1:07:47.300 --> 1:07:52.200]  She's facing the possibility of going to jail for years because she affirmed the reality of biological sex.
[1:07:52.300 --> 1:07:56.200]  Specifically, Ellingsen tweeted that men cannot be lesbians.
[1:07:56.300 --> 1:07:59.200]  Probably never thought about this in any depth, but it's technically true.
[1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:02.200]  She also said that men cannot become mothers.
[1:08:02.300 --> 1:08:04.200]  Now, again, that's true.
[1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:08.200]  But in Norway, as in all of the West, the truth is no longer a defense.
[1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:11.100]  Norway is now investigating her for hate speech.
[1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.100]  We, of course, immediately wanted to talk to her.
[1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:14.100]  Christina Ellingsen joins us tonight.
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.100]  Christina, thanks so much for coming on.
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.100]  This is one of those stories.
[1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:20.100]  In Norway is obviously a highly civilized country.
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:22.100]  I think it's the richest country in the world.
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:23.100]  A lot of great people in Norway.
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:26.100]  It's hard to believe this is real, and I just want to check.
[1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:29.100]  Are we leaving anything out?
[1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:30.100]  No.
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:31.100]  That's right.
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:32.100]  This is the case.
[1:08:32.100 --> 1:08:39.000]  You can't defend women if you can't define what a woman is.
[1:08:39.100 --> 1:08:46.000]  All over the world, stating biological fact is considered by a lot of groups
[1:08:46.100 --> 1:08:49.000]  as being directly hateful.
[1:08:49.100 --> 1:08:52.000]  This is what I've been doing.
[1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:56.000]  I've been stating the obvious fact that men cannot be women.
[1:08:56.100 --> 1:09:00.000]  Men cannot be girls or mothers or lesbians.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:05.900]  And now I'm facing the risk of three years in prison.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.900]  Tell me how the country of Norway, again, a country to which we give
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.900]  every benefit of every doubt filled with good people, beautiful place.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.900]  But are you celebrated as a hero by people who still believe in science and free speech?
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.900]  Are people supporting you?
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.900]  Well, a lot of people are supporting me across the entire spectrum
[1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:29.800]  of political, religious, everything.
[1:09:29.900 --> 1:09:36.800]  But a lot of people are also considering me on level with someone who's calling for genocide.
[1:09:36.900 --> 1:09:43.800]  I've been compared to and with everything from a fascist to a Maoist to a supporter
[1:09:43.900 --> 1:09:48.800]  of Westboro Baptist Church, which I don't even know what it is.
[1:09:48.900 --> 1:09:54.800]  But basically, the entire spectrum of everything that's bad in the world
[1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:57.700]  is being hurled my way, absolutely.
[1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:02.700]  But also a lot of support.
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:03.700]  Are you surprised?
[1:10:03.800 --> 1:10:06.700]  I think you're on, I'm just guessing, but I think you're on the left.
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:07.700]  I don't think you're a right winger.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:08.700]  I think you're from Norway.
[1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:12.700]  Are you surprised by all of this?
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:18.700]  Unfortunately, I'm not surprised because this has been in the cards for a long time.
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:23.700]  If you can't talk about biological reality, it's unavoidable.
[1:10:23.700 --> 1:10:26.600]  This is simply unavoidable.
[1:10:26.700 --> 1:10:32.600]  But yeah, no, I align myself with radical feminism.
[1:10:32.700 --> 1:10:36.600]  I've been voting left all my life.
[1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:42.600]  Now I'm much more critical to what they are actually saying.
[1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:50.600]  And it seems like, but it seems like all parties in Norway are supporting this pseudoscience.
[1:10:50.700 --> 1:10:51.600]  Scary.
[1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:52.600]  We know the feeling.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:53.500]  Thank you for joining us today.
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:54.500]  Christine Ellington.
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:57.500]  Very much appreciated.
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:02.500]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is in studio with us until a little bit of the next hour.
[1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:07.500]  Then Jacob Ingalls and Owen Shroy are going to be here to cover some big breaking news.
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:09.500]  We'll host some of the fourth hour.
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:16.500]  Robert Barnes is going to be here for the next few weeks with the Shandy Hook show trial beginning on July 25th
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:20.500]  with picking the jury and then opening statements on the 26th.
[1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:23.400]  We've got a lot of things going to be unfolding here.
[1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:28.400]  I can tell you there's real national attention in this case, not just from the Democratic Party
[1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:34.400]  and how they've rigged all this with the media and these corrupt judges.
[1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:39.400]  And they have really screwed up and in motions for remedy said,
[1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:43.400]  I'm going to show you these documents coming up in the last segment of this hour,
[1:11:43.500 --> 1:11:45.400]  that I cannot talk about the First Amendment.
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:49.400]  I cannot say I'm innocent and I cannot say it's a show trial.
[1:11:49.400 --> 1:11:51.300]  She actually said this in the order.
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:56.300]  Never before been done, not even the Nazi judges under Hitler were this transparent.
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:00.300]  I mean, this is literal insane asylum level crap.
[1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.300]  I'm guilty already, the judge says.
[1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:09.300]  I'm defaulted and this is all now going to be not one but two in Texas in the next few months
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:13.300]  and then one in Connecticut and they're all synced and coordinated.
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:16.300]  The exact same rulings the judge in Connecticut judge here
[1:12:16.300 --> 1:12:20.200]  and it just shows that the Democrats are going for broke.
[1:12:20.300 --> 1:12:21.200]  That's all coming up.
[1:12:21.300 --> 1:12:24.200]  But Robert Barnes, your historian is well good friend of mine.
[1:12:24.300 --> 1:12:26.200]  You've also worked on some of these cases.
[1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:27.200]  You've got the big Pfizer case.
[1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:30.200]  They say is the strongest case in the world of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
[1:12:30.300 --> 1:12:31.200]  The Pfizer whistleblower.
[1:12:31.300 --> 1:12:34.200]  We'll talk about that next segment, the ban and trial starting.
[1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:38.200]  But this big picture, the three minutes to break about the world today
[1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:41.200]  and just where you would say society is with them openly cutting the energy off,
[1:12:41.300 --> 1:12:44.200]  saying it's for a great reset, it's for your own good,
[1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:47.100]  separately than blaming Vladimir Putin and local gas stations.
[1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:50.100]  Well, I mean, basically the globalist agenda has failed and backfired in Ukraine.
[1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:55.100]  I mean, what it's triggered is a massive fuel and food shortages around the globe
[1:12:55.200 --> 1:13:00.100]  and what you're seeing is massive public rebellion against the globalist effort
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:03.100]  and so you're seeing in Panama, you're seeing protests in Panama,
[1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:05.100]  you know, the Sri Lanka government.
[1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:06.100]  Hundreds of hundreds.
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:07.100]  All over the place.
[1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.100]  You have the protests in Italy, the Netherlands, the UK, everywhere.
[1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:10.100]  And it's going to keep spreading.
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:11.100]  It's not going to be limited.
[1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:14.000]  It's going to be all over Central America, Latin America, Africa,
[1:13:14.100 --> 1:13:19.000]  because these are places that do not have the means to supply quickly
[1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:22.000]  a replacement for the food and fuel shortages that are coming,
[1:13:22.100 --> 1:13:24.000]  that have been induced by the globalist policies,
[1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:28.000]  a combination of the inflationary out-of-control debt-driven policies
[1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:32.000]  and politics during the lockdowns both in the U.S. and the West.
[1:13:32.100 --> 1:13:34.000]  Which we said 30 months ago would happen.
[1:13:34.100 --> 1:13:35.000]  Absolutely.
[1:13:35.100 --> 1:13:38.000]  You and I both in here precisely let it out.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:42.900]  You can't just print this much currency and not have a economic backlash.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.900]  And then they blame that on global warming when it's through exact policies.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:46.900]  Completely.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.900]  And in fact, the Fed is still pretending that they can control inflation now,
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.900]  that they can get it under control now for what they did
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.900]  and there's no proof that they can.
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.900]  Instead, what it appears they're going to do is they're going to bust the stock market.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.900]  They're going to bust the real estate market and sink us into a global depression.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.900]  But it all hinged on blaming us and global warming.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:04.900]  Everybody knows it's them.
[1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:09.800]  All the numbers show globalist parties are in the single digits or double digits.
[1:14:09.900 --> 1:14:11.800]  They have really screwed the pooch.
[1:14:11.900 --> 1:14:13.800]  They've bit off more than they can chew.
[1:14:13.900 --> 1:14:14.800]  Completely.
[1:14:14.900 --> 1:14:16.800]  I mean, Draghi was supposed to be a future European leader.
[1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:18.800]  Macron was supposed to have a big supermajority in the parliament.
[1:14:18.900 --> 1:14:20.800]  Neither of those events are coming true.
[1:14:20.900 --> 1:14:22.800]  Draghi would be lucky to be anything in Italy.
[1:14:22.900 --> 1:14:26.800]  Boris Johnson, assassination of the Japanese real leader.
[1:14:26.900 --> 1:14:27.800]  Exactly.
[1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:29.800]  I mean, just one after the other, after the other, after the other.
[1:14:29.900 --> 1:14:32.800]  And then, of course, you now have the economic problems and political protest in China
[1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:34.700]  because their no-COVID policy is backfiring.
[1:14:34.800 --> 1:14:35.700]  Bank runs.
[1:14:35.800 --> 1:14:39.700]  The state bubble exactly is imploding their financial economy.
[1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:41.700]  So you compound these things.
[1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:44.700]  The only country that appears to be stable and has a promising future
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:47.700]  is the country that was supposed to be under the mat at this point, and that's Russia.
[1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:48.700]  The country that's supposed to...
[1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:52.700]  They're actually doing well other than losing massive amounts of troops fighting the CIA
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:53.700]  and the New World Order.
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:54.700]  They're doing great.
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:14:55.700]  Completely.
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:57.700]  I mean, they're economically better off than they were before all this started,
[1:14:57.800 --> 1:15:00.700]  just as the ruble is better off than it has been in about a decade.
[1:15:00.700 --> 1:15:04.600]  So what we're seeing is globalist policies getting rejected around the globe.
[1:15:04.700 --> 1:15:07.600]  The question is, what do they do to try to maintain and sustain power
[1:15:07.700 --> 1:15:09.600]  as the world rejects their agenda?
[1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:12.600]  And that's where you're going to see a lot of desperation over the next 12 months.
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:16.600]  Well, they've been telegraphing power outages not caused by the Russian War
[1:15:16.700 --> 1:15:18.600]  but by Russia itself's cyber attacks.
[1:15:18.700 --> 1:15:21.600]  They're getting ready, I believe, not just for rolling blackouts,
[1:15:21.700 --> 1:15:23.600]  but big blackouts they blame on the Russians.
[1:15:23.700 --> 1:15:25.600]  Well, and we see more and more predictions of that.
[1:15:25.700 --> 1:15:27.600]  I mean, there have been issues involving...
[1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:30.500]  The attacks is actually with various alleged Russian attacks
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:33.500]  that don't appear to have been actual Russian attacks that appeared...
[1:15:33.600 --> 1:15:37.500]  In Tennessee, we have natural gas facilities that have been attacked.
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.500]  So we have across the globe an attack on food and fuel,
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:43.500]  the core of any society or civilization,
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:47.500]  and it's to perpetuate a globalist regime that the world is now rejecting.
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:49.500]  That's right, to make us dependent on them.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.500]  Robert Barnes with Smart People I Know, straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:58.400]  Big hour coming up.
[1:15:58.500 --> 1:16:04.400]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:07.400]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:12.400]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up
[1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:17.400]  is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:19.400]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:16:19.400 --> 1:16:22.300]  Even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem,
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:25.300]  I mean, all of us at one point or another do, that's just the truth.
[1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:27.300]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:31.300]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis,
[1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:36.300]  InstaHeart is the number one best-selling natural herbal supplement in the world

[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:13.900]  So we looked at the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with, and we said,

[1:18:19.900 --> 1:18:25.800]  We went and looked at the top 10, and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.

[1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:46.700]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months, and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.

[1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:58.700]  InfowarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:05.700]  We brought the game-changing product, previously only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago,
[1:19:05.700 --> 1:19:12.600]  the BioProse, for septic tanks, for porta-potties, for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.
[1:19:12.700 --> 1:19:15.600]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:27.600]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[1:19:27.700 --> 1:19:33.600]  And it's exclusively available at thebioprose.com and now InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:42.500]  We sold out of this for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:19:42.600 --> 1:19:49.500]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at InfowarsStore.com or thebioprose.com.
[1:19:49.500 --> 1:20:06.400]  Made in America, powered by God's great creation, it is amazing and it funds the Infowar.
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:40.400]  Alright Barnes, we were talking during that break about, I've asked you to come here in the next couple of weeks and stay with us to be a pundit and be an analyst during the Sandy Hook stuff.
[1:20:40.500 --> 1:20:48.400]  We appreciate you being here, but covering the waterfront, January 6th is huge, as you were saying during the break it's backfired, I agree.
[1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:57.300]  You've got the Bannon trial, you've also got HR 4350, the amendment to make the president basically a military dictator domestically.
[1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:01.300]  We've also got all the huge developments and lawsuits you're behind.
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:12.300]  The top lawsuit on Pfizer with a whistleblower, we've got Biden, we'll cover this next segment, is going to announce, they've now said a climate emergency tomorrow.
[1:21:12.300 --> 1:21:21.200]  As the pretext to continue to shut down the infrastructure, I mean they are really, really squeezing us hard.
[1:21:21.300 --> 1:21:28.200]  There's the Hill reporting on it, White House declared climate emergency as soon as Wednesday, I guess they think legally they'll try to bypass things.
[1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:30.200]  What do you want to tackle first?
[1:21:30.300 --> 1:21:39.200]  Well it's all this, what we said at the time of the whole Octown activity taking place, they're going to misuse and abuse the emergency powers and if they get away with it they'll expand it dramatically.
[1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:42.100]  And they said that, they said we've done the virus now as climate.
[1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:43.100]  Absolutely.
[1:21:43.200 --> 1:21:44.100]  They said climate lockdowns.
[1:21:44.200 --> 1:21:46.100]  Oh sorry, there's no power, you're locked down.
[1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:48.100]  Not only that, you've got racial emergencies.
[1:21:48.200 --> 1:21:51.100]  Take here in Texas, so Roe v. Wade is overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:52.100]  What do they say?
[1:21:52.200 --> 1:22:00.100]  They say there's a medical emergency that requires mandatory abortions in Texas hospitals by under federal law.
[1:22:00.200 --> 1:22:08.100]  And so that's what the Secretary of Health and Human Services did, so much so the state of Texas has now had to sue to try to undo the damage caused by this executive.
[1:22:08.100 --> 1:22:10.000]  So it's ruled by emergency?
[1:22:10.100 --> 1:22:16.000]  Absolutely, I mean this goes all the way back to the famous Constitution, the Weimar Constitution of Germany.
[1:22:16.100 --> 1:22:28.000]  The great flaw in the Constitution that was then considered the crowning achievement of continental Europe in terms of constitutional democracy was undermined because it had an emergency exception within it.
[1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:30.000]  And they misused and abused it.
[1:22:30.100 --> 1:22:37.000]  And of course we had the trilogy of infamy of the U.S. Supreme Court cases here that misused and abused emergency power and state police power.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.900]  So what do they say in Jacobson?
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.900]  You could force, you could charge people to fine if they don't take a vaccine.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:47.900]  Then in the case of Connie Buck, Buck V. Bell said that you can force people to be sterilized against their will.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.900]  And then of course in Korematsu, lock people up and strip them of all their constitutional rights in the future.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:55.900]  And you warned Amy Comey Barrett would support that pass rulings that she has?
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.900]  Yes, I mean sadly she has been the decisive vote to not overturn the elections.
[1:22:59.900 --> 1:23:06.800]  The decisive vote to not meaningfully review these vaccine mandates in almost every context other than federal employment context.
[1:23:06.900 --> 1:23:17.800]  Let's tie that to H.R. 435-0 that plain and simple says Congress will no longer have domestic oversight of the military and the president, whoever that is going to be, will.
[1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:21.800]  This just shows they're getting ready for total emergency rule.
[1:23:21.900 --> 1:23:25.800]  Yes, I mean the goal is to create a rule by emergency structure.
[1:23:25.900 --> 1:23:28.800]  I mean now it's rule by emergency even against the U.S. Supreme Court.
[1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:34.700]  It's not just rule by emergency against the state governments, against the people's rights, against the legislative or executive branches.
[1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:38.700]  And they've announced, as you told me during the break, they officially are going to stack the quarter track.
[1:23:38.800 --> 1:23:44.700]  Yes, they are now putting forward legislation in the House to add four justices to the United States Supreme Court.
[1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:48.700]  So that they would handpick to shift the balance of power in the court.
[1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:55.700]  And they have said that if they don't get that, that they would like to consider some people on the left scrapping the Supreme Court entirely.
[1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:58.600]  And let's start over. We should probably cover that first.
[1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:00.600]  Sure.
[1:24:00.700 --> 1:24:07.600]  This is unbelievable. And they say moral happening year in history that happens in 100, we're entering that period, aren't we?
[1:24:07.700 --> 1:24:10.600]  Oh, no doubt about it. The last five years has been the craziest time period.
[1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:17.600]  And the last two years has been the craziest time period I can remember in American political history outside of maybe the Revolution and the Civil War.
[1:24:17.700 --> 1:24:24.600]  And even those did not pose the degree of threat to constitutional liberty that we have witnessed on a national and even global scale in terms of fundamental freedom.
[1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:27.500]  So we're living in an incredibly dangerous historic time.
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:31.500]  Absolutely. It's a time that's going to decide the future. It's a crossroads.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:39.500]  It's a crossroads either to a time of great hope, great peace, great prosperity, great freedom, great liberty, or a time period of great repression and oppression.
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:43.500]  I compare it to like 1939 kind of environment.
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:51.500]  So it's a time period that we're either going to see the rise of fascism and communism and that kind of method of government, whether it's the global reset agenda, a globalist agenda,
[1:24:51.500 --> 1:25:00.400]  an emergency rule driven agenda, a totalitarian agenda, an elite driven agenda, or an agenda of the people by the people and for the people around the globe.
[1:25:00.500 --> 1:25:07.400]  So we are the world at the crossroads. In fact, that's the title we'll give, World at the Crossroads, Emergency Report Robert Barnes.
[1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:11.400]  We'll call this hour that. That really is it. We are at the crossroads.
[1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:18.400]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, just to bridge into whether or not we can sue the FDA and whether or not a whistleblower can bring a claim against Pfizer.
[1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:22.300]  I have both of those cases with Robert Kennedy against the FDA.
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:28.300]  Can they force a drug and lie to families and children about a drug on people as young as six months old?
[1:25:28.400 --> 1:25:31.300]  Because that's what the FDA is now authorized. We've challenged that.
[1:25:31.400 --> 1:25:32.300]  They're saying it's safe and effective and it's not.
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:36.300]  Absolutely. It's not safe. It's not effective. It's not a vaccine. It's none of the three.
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:41.300]  They're using Elmo and Big Bird in schools and public institutions to lie to little kids.
[1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:49.200]  Even before it was authorized six and up by the kangaroo panel that they had replaced three times, that was illegal to do that for those kids.
[1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:53.200]  Absolutely. It has never been clinically tested in such a way to call it safe.
[1:25:53.300 --> 1:25:58.200]  It's never been clinically tested in such a way to call it effective. It's not even a vaccine.
[1:25:58.300 --> 1:26:01.200]  We now have the internal from the Freedom of Information Act.
[1:26:01.300 --> 1:26:10.200]  We have their internal emails that prove and document and demonstrate that they knew that it wasn't a vaccine, that they were being exposed for the fact that this drug wasn't a vaccine.
[1:26:10.200 --> 1:26:16.100]  They decided to literally change the definition of the word vaccine to retrofit this drug into it.
[1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:18.100]  It's not safe. It's not effective. It's not a vaccine.
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.100]  Not only that, there's no emergency for children.
[1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:23.100]  What's the emergency for six months old or two years old from COVID?
[1:26:23.200 --> 1:26:24.100]  There's no emergency.
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:33.100]  Let me ask you this. Why did they have the Wavos to cut off the world economy to release this virus to launch these wars and then to cut the power off?
[1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:37.100]  I mean, these people have got big Wavos. I guess it's because they think they control the medium.
[1:26:37.100 --> 1:26:42.000]  I think it's a two-fold process. Some of the people involved in this are simply incompetent. They're simply incapable.
[1:26:42.100 --> 1:26:43.000]  They didn't predict in full.
[1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:44.000]  Oh, yeah. The globalists just get mortars.
[1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:45.000]  Yeah, completely.
[1:26:45.100 --> 1:26:50.000]  I mean, so more and more these people with power don't know what they're doing frequently.
[1:26:50.100 --> 1:27:03.000]  And of those that do, the malevolent, the mischievous ones, your Bill Gates is of the world, your George Soros is of the world, your Rockefeller's of the world, that crowd, they simply see that what's good for them is good for the world.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:08.900]  They've convinced themselves that their agenda is the best agenda, and they just simply have to force it and coerce it onto the public.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.900]  That's why they like to look to China's domestic example.
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:19.900]  They don't like China sticking its head up and challenging any aspect of globalism, but they like the way China governs its local domestic population.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.900]  And they've been trying to impose and superimpose the same agenda along the globe.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:31.900]  Just like Stalin admired Hitler, feared Hitler, and hated Hitler, but he's on record telling his generals, I want to be like Hitler.
[1:27:31.900 --> 1:27:38.800]  Absolutely. It's a very similar kind of approach. It's people who model their domestic control but don't necessarily want them to have international power.
[1:27:38.900 --> 1:27:43.800]  And this globalist agenda has mirrored aspects of what China has been experimenting with over the past decade and plus.
[1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:49.800]  And it's trying to impose it on the Western world, and the problem is the Western world, the people of the Western world, the working classes of the Western world.
[1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:50.800]  I'm rejecting it.
[1:27:50.900 --> 1:27:51.800]  Exactly. Don't want it. Don't want to be a part of it.
[1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:55.800]  And let's be clear, it was globalist think tanks that have used China as a laboratory.
[1:27:55.900 --> 1:27:58.800]  That's why Bill Gates and the Rockefellers and Rothschilds are behind China.
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:01.700]  China's not alone. It's a whole globalist China faction.
[1:28:01.800 --> 1:28:03.700]  And we know from history. This is not new.
[1:28:03.800 --> 1:28:07.700]  I mean, who was it that was heavily involved in eugenics in early Nazi Germany?
[1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:11.700]  It was the Rockefeller Foundation. They were the ones helping push it, promote it, propagate it.
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:19.700]  So this is simply, they're taking back the old 1920s, 1930s script for globalist power, both in terms of what they're doing in domestic...
[1:28:19.800 --> 1:28:23.700]  I agree. We're repeating World War I and World War II with a high-tech overlay at the same time.
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:26.700]  Absolutely. And the difference is this could lead to nuclear global conflict.
[1:28:26.700 --> 1:28:32.600]  This could lead to global public health pandemics of a kind that truly are uncontrollable.
[1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:34.600]  And that's the great threat.
[1:28:34.700 --> 1:28:39.600]  Or economic food and fuel, famine and shortages around the globe that could destroy populations in the billions.
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:41.600]  And that's what they all agree about.
[1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:45.600]  They don't mind that side effect because that side effect is their intended objective in the end, isn't it?
[1:28:45.700 --> 1:28:48.600]  Exactly. As long as they don't get to blame for it, they're going to launch it.
[1:28:48.700 --> 1:28:49.600]  That's why they've got to get to blame.
[1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:51.600]  Expose the New World Order is beyond critical.
[1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:53.600]  Let's talk about Ukraine and the world economy.
[1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:56.500]  We come back, and then a lot more, Robert Barnes.
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:04.500]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.500]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:12.500]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:16.500]  is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.500]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:21.500]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem,
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:24.400]  I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth.
[1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:26.400]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.
[1:29:26.500 --> 1:29:30.400]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis,

[1:31:37.100 --> 1:31:39.000]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:41.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:31:41.100 --> 1:31:43.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75% off.
[1:31:43.100 --> 1:31:45.000]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.900]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.900]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:55.900]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:57.900]  I go and see them quite often now.
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.900]  Granny Do Right. Granny Do Right.
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.900]  Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.900]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:12.900]  I am a granny and we're all the senior citizens out there
[1:32:12.900 --> 1:32:15.800]  and it may have been a lifetime in the sun like me.
[1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:19.800]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[1:32:19.900 --> 1:32:22.800]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years,
[1:32:22.900 --> 1:32:25.800]  my skin is just really gorgeous, actually.
[1:32:25.900 --> 1:32:27.800]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[1:32:27.900 --> 1:32:31.800]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought,
[1:32:31.900 --> 1:32:34.800]  you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:36.800]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:39.800]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:43.700]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing, okay,
[1:32:43.800 --> 1:32:46.700]  you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful.
[1:32:46.800 --> 1:32:51.700]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:53.700]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully
[1:32:53.700 --> 1:33:19.600]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:24.500]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:24.600 --> 1:33:28.500]  I used to be such a sweet sweet things away.
[1:33:28.600 --> 1:33:31.500]  Got a hold of me.
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:35.500]  I opened doors for little old ladies.
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:37.500]  I helped the plan to see.
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:39.500]  I got no friends.
[1:33:39.600 --> 1:33:40.500]  I got no friends.
[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:43.500]  Does they read the papers?
[1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:47.500]  They can't be seen with me.
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:54.400]  I'm feeling real shut down and I'm feeling me.
[1:33:54.500 --> 1:34:00.400]  A major explosion at the Hoover Dam in Nevada.
[1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:03.400]  Hundreds of food processing plants blown up,
[1:34:03.500 --> 1:34:05.400]  burned down the last six months.
[1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:08.400]  Hundreds of times the regular number.
[1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:10.400]  Insane stuff going on.
[1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:11.400]  We are under attack.
[1:34:11.500 --> 1:34:13.400]  We're going to cover it all here today,
[1:34:13.500 --> 1:34:16.400]  but we're not supposed to talk about Ukraine.
[1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:18.300]  The little thing of the present,
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:21.300]  the little thing today, you know,
[1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:25.300]  it's COVID and it's monkeypox
[1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:27.300]  and it's transgenderism
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:28.300]  and then it's this and it's that.
[1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:30.300]  But now Ukraine's moved away,
[1:34:30.400 --> 1:34:33.300]  but now they want the IMF and World Bank
[1:34:33.400 --> 1:34:36.300]  600 plus billion dollars injected.
[1:34:36.400 --> 1:34:40.300]  Close to 100 billion dollars has already been injected
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.300]  and Russia is winning that war
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:44.300]  to take over the Russian held areas
[1:34:44.300 --> 1:34:46.200]  that have always been historically Russia
[1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:48.200]  in eastern Ukraine.
[1:34:48.300 --> 1:34:51.200]  And Russian oil exports are at record numbers,
[1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:52.200]  profits are at record numbers,
[1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:54.200]  there are rubles at record highs.
[1:34:54.300 --> 1:34:56.200]  Putin is winning this war,
[1:34:56.300 --> 1:34:57.200]  our barns in my view.
[1:34:57.300 --> 1:35:00.200]  Your take on why they want us to forget about Ukraine.
[1:35:00.300 --> 1:35:02.200]  Because Ukraine was supposed to be the end
[1:35:02.300 --> 1:35:03.200]  of sort of a challenge.
[1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:05.200]  I mean, Putin was along with Trump
[1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:06.200]  two of the biggest challengers
[1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:08.200]  to sort of a globalist agenda in the world
[1:35:08.300 --> 1:35:11.200]  and Putin has been that for 20, 25 plus years.
[1:35:11.300 --> 1:35:13.200]  And so whatever people think about Putin,
[1:35:13.200 --> 1:35:15.100]  the reality is he was an enemy of Klaus Schwab,
[1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:16.100]  an enemy of George Soros.
[1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:17.100]  Soros hated him.
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:19.100]  Putin famously banned him from the country.
[1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:21.100]  An enemy of the Clintons,
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:23.100]  an enemy of the Rockefellers,
[1:35:23.200 --> 1:35:24.100]  an enemy of Bill Gates,
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:25.100]  that whole agenda.
[1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:28.100]  And so the goal was to use Ukraine as a pretext
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:30.100]  to wipe Russia off the face of the earth
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:33.100]  and to return it to its 90s era colonialism,
[1:35:33.200 --> 1:35:35.100]  breaking up the country.
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:36.100]  They've announced these plans publicly.
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:38.100]  So that's what was supposed to happen.
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:39.100]  Instead, what's happened is
[1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:41.100]  the globalists are losing and Russia is winning
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:42.100]  and the net effect of it
[1:35:42.100 --> 1:35:44.000]  is probably the end of a global digital currency.
[1:35:44.100 --> 1:35:47.000]  Those plans have gone to sort of, to crap very quickly.
[1:35:47.100 --> 1:35:50.000]  Even Tony Blair is a New World Order puppet.
[1:35:50.100 --> 1:35:53.000]  He says the end of U.K., U.S. dominance is here.
[1:35:53.100 --> 1:35:55.000]  They've, in a way, they kind of walked us into this.
[1:35:55.100 --> 1:35:56.000]  They did.
[1:35:56.100 --> 1:35:58.000]  They basically took a big gamble.
[1:35:58.100 --> 1:35:59.000]  They went to the roulette wheel
[1:35:59.100 --> 1:36:00.000]  and gambled against Putin.
[1:36:00.100 --> 1:36:02.000]  And it turns out poking the Russian bear
[1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:04.000]  has never been a successful historical strategy
[1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:05.000]  and it wasn't again.
[1:36:05.100 --> 1:36:07.000]  And instead, it's they who are imploding
[1:36:07.100 --> 1:36:10.000]  and are resorting to extreme measures domestically
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.900]  to counteract this complete loss
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:13.900]  and debacle on the battlefield.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:14.900]  I mean, people forget.
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:15.900]  We remember World War I,
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:16.900]  you went in with a bunch of empires
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:17.900]  and by the end of it,
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:19.900]  a bunch of empires that had been around for centuries,
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:21.900]  the Ottoman Empire, gone.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:22.900]  British Empire, mostly gone.
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:24.900]  Austrian-Hungarian?
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:25.900]  Entirely gone.
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:26.900]  I mean, look in any...
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:28.900]  One really killed the British Empire.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:29.900]  Absolutely it did.
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.900]  I mean, you had all those empires wiped off the map
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.900]  with politically, geopolitically,
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:36.900]  and some completely historically entirely.
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:37.900]  And what produced that?
[1:36:37.900 --> 1:36:39.800]  The Austro-Hungarian Empire?
[1:36:39.900 --> 1:36:40.800]  I mean, what happens is you can't have
[1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:42.800]  six generations of uncles marrying nieces
[1:36:42.900 --> 1:36:45.800]  and end up with competent, capable leadership.
[1:36:45.900 --> 1:36:46.800]  And that's what the Austro-Hungarian...
[1:36:46.900 --> 1:36:47.800]  And that's what we've got with Biden
[1:36:47.900 --> 1:36:48.800]  and all these people.
[1:36:48.900 --> 1:36:49.800]  That's exactly what we've got.
[1:36:49.900 --> 1:36:50.800]  We have intellectually...
[1:36:50.900 --> 1:36:52.800]  Nothing but retarded arrogance.
[1:36:52.900 --> 1:36:53.800]  Absolutely.
[1:36:53.900 --> 1:36:54.800]  That's exactly what it is.
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:36:57.800]  It's a new degree of incapacity
[1:36:57.900 --> 1:36:59.800]  and incompetence and incapability.
[1:36:59.900 --> 1:37:00.800]  And we'll talk about it in the next segment,
[1:37:00.900 --> 1:37:03.800]  but it's like the judges in Connecticut and Texas say,
[1:37:03.900 --> 1:37:05.800]  no free speech, you're already guilty,
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:07.700]  you can't say it's a rigged trial.
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:08.700]  I can say whatever I want to trial.
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:10.700]  I mean, they're just nuts.
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:11.700]  Completely.
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:13.700]  What would happen if Caligula and King Lear
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:14.700]  married and produced an offspring?
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:16.700]  It would look a lot like Joe Biden.
[1:37:16.800 --> 1:37:18.700]  And that's precisely what we have.
[1:37:18.800 --> 1:37:19.700]  But Caligula married his horse.
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:20.700]  Yes, yes, he did.
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:22.700]  Well, that too would look like Joe Biden.
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:25.700]  So the net effect of it is what we have today.
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:27.700]  So what you're seeing in the battlefield
[1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:30.700]  is Ukraine could never win that militarily.
[1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:33.700]  Russia's military is a trillion-dollar plus size military
[1:37:33.700 --> 1:37:36.600]  when you add up its accumulated weaponry
[1:37:36.700 --> 1:37:38.600]  and skill set of its professional soldiers.
[1:37:38.700 --> 1:37:40.600]  And yeah, they got shoot up against the CIA,
[1:37:40.700 --> 1:37:41.600]  but they've showed commitment.
[1:37:41.700 --> 1:37:42.600]  Oh, completely.
[1:37:42.700 --> 1:37:44.600]  I mean, they realized that they were going to take certain hits,
[1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:46.600]  but they were willing to take those hits.
[1:37:46.700 --> 1:37:47.600]  And what I told people is there's a classic case
[1:37:47.700 --> 1:37:49.600]  of confession through projection.
[1:37:49.700 --> 1:37:51.600]  Just as everything they accused Trump of
[1:37:51.700 --> 1:37:53.600]  is what Joe Biden has been actually guilty of,
[1:37:53.700 --> 1:37:56.600]  what the Ukrainians claim is happening to Russia
[1:37:56.700 --> 1:37:57.600]  is usually happening to Ukraine.
[1:37:57.700 --> 1:37:58.600]  And what history shows,
[1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.600]  if you've got a mass of people ready to fight,
[1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:02.600]  even if you're low-tech like the Vietnamese,
[1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:05.500]  you can't beat a resistance that won't give up.
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:06.500]  No doubt about it.
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:07.500]  And what you have with Russia
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:09.500]  is these are Russian-occupied territories.
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:12.500]  These are places where people are ancestrally Russian,
[1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:15.500]  ethnically Russian, linguistically Russian.
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:16.500]  Russia was born in Ukraine.
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:17.500]  Absolutely.
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:19.500]  I mean, most of these cities were established
[1:38:19.600 --> 1:38:22.500]  by their great, the parts that they're in
[1:38:22.600 --> 1:38:24.500]  all the way to Odessa if they go there,
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:26.500]  were established by the Russian Empire.
[1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:27.500]  A thousand-plus years.
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:28.500]  Exactly.
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:29.500]  I mean, it goes back way, way back.
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:31.500]  The only part that's traditionally historically
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:34.400]  Polish-oriented is the Western part of Ukraine
[1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:36.400]  where they're not going to go into.
[1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:37.400]  So what's happened?
[1:38:37.500 --> 1:38:39.400]  Like, remember when they said Putin had health problems?
[1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:40.400]  Well, it's really Biden that has health problems.
[1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.400]  Remember when they said that it was Russia
[1:38:42.500 --> 1:38:45.400]  that was having major internal dissension,
[1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:48.400]  losing law enforcement intelligence officers,
[1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:50.400]  prosecutors, and military officials?
[1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:51.400]  Well, just this week,
[1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:53.400]  Ukraine had to sack their top prosecutor,
[1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:56.400]  had to sack the head of their military intelligence.
[1:38:56.500 --> 1:38:57.400]  They just sacked their military.
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:58.400]  Completely.
[1:38:58.500 --> 1:38:59.400]  I mean, they're just sacking top.
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:01.300]  Not because their top people aren't on board.
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:02.300]  They're top people.
[1:39:02.400 --> 1:39:03.300]  Zelensky is simply...
[1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:04.300]  Well, they're telling Zelensky,
[1:39:04.400 --> 1:39:07.300]  the actor, the gay porn star, you're losing.
[1:39:07.400 --> 1:39:08.300]  Exactly.
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.300]  Like, Hitler firing generals in 45,
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:11.300]  it ain't working.
[1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:12.300]  Exactly.
[1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:13.300]  These are people who know
[1:39:13.400 --> 1:39:15.300]  there's no sustainable Ukrainian future
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:17.300]  under Zelensky and the West's current agenda for Ukraine.
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:18.300]  So these are people that,
[1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:20.300]  when they try to push back at all,
[1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:21.300]  even though they're deeply anti-Russian,
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:23.300]  many of these political, military,
[1:39:23.400 --> 1:39:24.300]  law enforcement leaders,
[1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:26.300]  they get sacked because they're unwilling
[1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:28.300]  to sacrifice their entire nation
[1:39:28.300 --> 1:39:31.200]  on the global altar of Bill Gates and George Soros
[1:39:31.300 --> 1:39:32.200]  and Klaus Schwab.
[1:39:32.300 --> 1:39:34.200]  And Zelensky's happy to,
[1:39:34.300 --> 1:39:36.200]  because Zelensky doesn't plan on being in Kiev
[1:39:36.300 --> 1:39:37.200]  five years from now.
[1:39:37.300 --> 1:39:39.200]  He plans on being in Hollywood five years from now,
[1:39:39.300 --> 1:39:41.200]  making movies with Angelina Jolie
[1:39:41.300 --> 1:39:43.200]  and Sean Penn and the rest of that crew.
[1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:45.200]  So that's where their agenda is.
[1:39:45.300 --> 1:39:48.200]  Not imagine wanting to run the collapsing Hollywood
[1:39:48.300 --> 1:39:50.200]  and that cesspit.
[1:39:50.300 --> 1:39:52.200]  These people are crazy.
[1:39:52.300 --> 1:39:53.200]  Well, remember this guy was
[1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:54.200]  the number one listed guy
[1:39:54.300 --> 1:39:55.200]  in the Panama Papers release.
[1:39:55.300 --> 1:39:57.200]  This is a guy that had over 100 million dollars
[1:39:57.200 --> 1:39:59.100]  stashed in various foreign bank accounts
[1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:00.100]  outside of Ukraine.
[1:40:00.200 --> 1:40:02.100]  I mean, basically, he literally was an actor.
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:03.100]  They came to him and said,
[1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:05.100]  pretend to be the president for five years,
[1:40:05.200 --> 1:40:06.100]  then we'll make you the president.
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:08.100]  When he gets in, he promises to bring peace.
[1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.100]  He reverses all of his promises
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:11.100]  because he's just talking about brainwashing.
[1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.100]  They had like seven, eight TV shows
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:15.100]  where he was the president ahead of it.
[1:40:15.200 --> 1:40:16.100]  Completely.
[1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:17.100]  In fact, that's all he did is he played
[1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:18.100]  the president for five years
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:19.100]  and then they made him president
[1:40:19.200 --> 1:40:21.100]  and all the oligarchs that sort of pushed him up
[1:40:21.200 --> 1:40:23.100]  on behalf of the West.
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:24.100]  As soon as he got in,
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:25.100]  he had to break all of his promises,
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:26.100]  break his promise.
[1:40:26.100 --> 1:40:28.000]  I mean, he was at 15, 20% approval
[1:40:28.100 --> 1:40:29.000]  before this war started.
[1:40:29.100 --> 1:40:31.000]  He was a complete disaster of a leader.
[1:40:31.100 --> 1:40:33.000]  He's never cared about Ukraine.
[1:40:33.100 --> 1:40:35.000]  He is what they said Trump was,
[1:40:35.100 --> 1:40:37.000]  someone who didn't care looking to use office
[1:40:37.100 --> 1:40:38.000]  to get rich.
[1:40:38.100 --> 1:40:39.000]  That's who Zelensky is.
[1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:41.000]  And that's where Zelensky,
[1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:43.000]  he plans on parachuting out of Ukraine.
[1:40:43.100 --> 1:40:44.000]  He reads a different script each day.
[1:40:44.100 --> 1:40:45.000]  He doesn't even,
[1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:46.000]  sometimes he'll contradict himself
[1:40:46.100 --> 1:40:47.000]  within an hour.
[1:40:47.100 --> 1:40:48.000]  And the great part is
[1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:50.000]  everybody gets to some money laundering operation
[1:40:50.100 --> 1:40:52.000]  and all the Hunter Biden stuff's coming out.
[1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:53.000]  What do you think of Hunter Biden?
[1:40:53.100 --> 1:40:54.000]  I think Hunter Biden,
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:55.900]  I mean, we've known people like this,
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:56.900]  people that have grown up
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:58.900]  in extremely abusive families
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:00.900]  who are actually crying out for help
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.900]  by accidentally leaving things behind.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:04.900]  You hear that you have the daughter
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.900]  accidentally leaving behind her diary.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:08.900]  You have Hunter accidentally leaving behind this stuff.
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:10.900]  Oh yeah, they're sabotaging themselves.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:11.900]  Completely.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:12.900]  And I know people,
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:13.900]  when he's now,
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:14.900]  they've moved him to Venice.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:16.900]  So the people in Venice are,
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.900]  they had to move him from Malibu
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:19.900]  because his location got outed
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:21.900]  because the Secret Service was all over the place
[1:41:21.900 --> 1:41:23.800]  and because he couldn't keep a low profile.
[1:41:23.900 --> 1:41:24.800]  He was there in one of those
[1:41:24.900 --> 1:41:26.800]  special Malibu drug rehabs,
[1:41:26.900 --> 1:41:27.800]  which are a complete joke.
[1:41:27.900 --> 1:41:29.800]  People can read Mark Grober's book
[1:41:29.900 --> 1:41:31.800]  about the nature of those rehabs.
[1:41:31.900 --> 1:41:33.800]  But they've now moved him down to Venice
[1:41:33.900 --> 1:41:34.800]  to keep him on low key.
[1:41:34.900 --> 1:41:35.800]  I don't think it's a coincidence
[1:41:35.900 --> 1:41:37.800]  that suddenly his passport,
[1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:38.800]  his password gets breached
[1:41:38.900 --> 1:41:40.800]  and all this private information comes out.
[1:41:40.900 --> 1:41:42.800]  Why is he tape recording himself
[1:41:42.900 --> 1:41:43.800]  doing a lot of these activities?
[1:41:43.900 --> 1:41:44.800]  This is somebody who-
[1:41:44.900 --> 1:41:45.800]  Mr. Blackbell was dead.
[1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:46.800]  And to get out,
[1:41:46.900 --> 1:41:48.800]  this is someone in extreme pain.
[1:41:48.900 --> 1:41:49.800]  That's his behavior.
[1:41:49.900 --> 1:41:50.800]  Extreme pain,
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:53.700]  extreme pain begging for someone to bail him out.
[1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.700]  And the diaries and things say that.
[1:41:55.800 --> 1:41:56.700]  Yes.
[1:41:56.800 --> 1:41:57.700]  That's what they confirm.
[1:41:57.800 --> 1:41:58.700]  Everything reaffirms,
[1:41:58.800 --> 1:41:59.700]  this is someone who suffered
[1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.700]  such extreme abuse as a child
[1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:03.700]  from his own father
[1:42:03.800 --> 1:42:05.700]  that he is desperate for somebody
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:07.700]  to massively intervene in his life
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:10.700]  because otherwise it is on a self-destructive path
[1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:12.700]  that will just burn up very quickly.
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:13.700]  What happens to Obama's
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.700]  Third Administration, Puppet Biden?
[1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:16.700]  So I think-
[1:42:16.800 --> 1:42:18.700]  I think Biden's already DOA.
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:19.700]  He's operating on different scripts
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:20.600]  and they can't even keep him up.
[1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:22.600]  I mean, they renamed on Google Maps
[1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:24.600]  Brandon Falls for where he fell down.
[1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:26.600]  I mean, that's who the guy is famous for.
[1:42:26.700 --> 1:42:28.600]  So given the situation he is in
[1:42:28.700 --> 1:42:30.600]  and the position he is in,
[1:42:30.700 --> 1:42:31.600]  there's very little chance
[1:42:31.700 --> 1:42:33.600]  that he has any potential future.
[1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:35.600]  When what you're most well known for
[1:42:35.700 --> 1:42:36.600]  is falling down
[1:42:36.700 --> 1:42:38.600]  when you're walking up the stairs.
[1:42:38.700 --> 1:42:39.600]  We remember Gerald Ford
[1:42:39.700 --> 1:42:40.600]  and the Saturday Night Live skits
[1:42:40.700 --> 1:42:42.600]  with Chevy Chase.
[1:42:42.700 --> 1:42:43.600]  He's doomed.
[1:42:43.700 --> 1:42:44.600]  He's DOA.
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:42:45.600]  He's on the clock.
[1:42:45.700 --> 1:42:47.600]  The only question is who replaces him?
[1:42:47.700 --> 1:42:48.600]  We got some big news.
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:50.500]  The latest attack on free speech
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:51.500]  and the attempt to shut down
[1:42:51.600 --> 1:42:52.500]  InfoWars right ahead.
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:53.500]  This is critical information.
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:55.500]  Please take it with us.
[1:42:57.600 --> 1:42:59.500]  The number one selling category
[1:42:59.600 --> 1:43:00.500]  in supplements worldwide
[1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.500]  is fat burners,
[1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:04.500]  is weight loss formulas.
[1:43:04.600 --> 1:43:05.500]  And listen, there are hundreds
[1:43:05.600 --> 1:43:07.500]  of them out there that work.
[1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:10.500]  But most of them do it in a toxic way.
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:11.500]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.500]  we went out and did deep research
[1:43:13.600 --> 1:43:15.500]  on the safest, healthiest ways
[1:43:15.500 --> 1:43:20.400]  to take your overall body's metabolic system
[1:43:20.500 --> 1:43:21.400]  and your metabolism
[1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:24.400]  and turn that clock back
[1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:27.400]  by turning up your metabolism.
[1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:28.400]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:31.400]  healthy way.
[1:43:31.500 --> 1:43:32.400]  It's amazing.
[1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:33.400]  I've almost lost 40 pounds
[1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:34.400]  in the last three months
[1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:36.400]  just using the samples of it.
[1:43:36.500 --> 1:43:38.400]  But now it's come into the InfoWars store
[1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:39.400]  and it's ready for sale

[1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:57.300]  because it's worked great for me.
[1:43:57.400 --> 1:43:58.300]  At this point,
[1:43:58.400 --> 1:44:00.300]  best case scenario
[1:44:00.400 --> 1:44:02.300]  is a few years of hard times
[1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:04.300]  for us all.
[1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:05.300]  And if we don't turn it around
[1:44:05.400 --> 1:44:08.300]  soon, then it will only get worse.
[1:44:08.400 --> 1:44:10.300]  But as bad as things are,
[1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:12.300]  we still have time to prepare
[1:44:12.300 --> 1:44:14.200]  and that alone is something
[1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:15.200]  to be grateful for.
[1:44:15.300 --> 1:44:17.200]  A gravity water filter

[1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:20.200]  with clean, healthy water
[1:44:20.300 --> 1:44:21.200]  even in the event
[1:44:21.300 --> 1:44:23.200]  of your taps getting shut off
[1:44:23.300 --> 1:44:25.200]  and having your own food
[1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:26.200]  will save you from getting
[1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:29.200]  ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[1:44:29.300 --> 1:44:30.200]  And if you've already stocked up
[1:44:30.300 --> 1:44:32.200]  enough for your own family,
[1:44:32.300 --> 1:44:33.200]  you might want to consider
[1:44:33.300 --> 1:44:36.200]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:44:36.300 --> 1:44:37.200]  Some of your neighbors
[1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:39.200]  might not be prepared
[1:44:39.300 --> 1:44:40.200]  for what's coming,
[1:44:40.300 --> 1:44:41.200]  but you can help them
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:43.100]  by having an abundance
[1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:44.100]  of storable foods
[1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:46.100]  and water filtration.

[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.900]  That's infowarstore.com.
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.900]  7 months ago in December of 2021
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:00.900]  we launched the first
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:02.900]  in the 3 coin founding member series
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.900]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:06.900]  Then we launched the
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:07.900]  Tree of Liberty coin
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:08.900]  and finally
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:09.900]  the Second Amendment
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:11.900]  comment taken Molan Lobby coin.
[1:46:11.900 --> 1:46:14.800]  There are only 75 coins left
[1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:17.800]  in the 3 coin series
[1:46:17.900 --> 1:46:19.800]  exclusively right now

[1:46:22.900 --> 1:46:24.800]  and for the final 75 people
[1:46:24.900 --> 1:46:25.800]  to become founding members
[1:46:25.900 --> 1:46:26.800]  for this big project
[1:46:26.900 --> 1:46:28.800]  we're launching in the near future
[1:46:28.900 --> 1:46:29.800]  you'll also get a personal
[1:46:29.900 --> 1:46:30.800]  signed piece of art
[1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:32.800]  I made of the sheepdog
[1:46:32.900 --> 1:46:33.800]  chasing the wolf
[1:46:33.900 --> 1:46:34.800]  and a personal message.
[1:46:34.900 --> 1:46:35.800]  It's your last chance
[1:46:35.900 --> 1:46:37.800]  to get all three coins
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:41.700]  at 1776coin.com
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:43.700]  This is history happening now
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:46.700]  infowarstore support is changing the world
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:49.700]  and this is the final 75
[1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:50.700]  3 coin set
[1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:51.700]  exclusively available
[1:46:51.700 --> 1:47:15.600]  at 1776coin.com
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:21.500]  All right, we're about to cover something
[1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:23.500]  that is incredibly central
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:25.500]  to all of our futures
[1:47:25.600 --> 1:47:27.500]  because they admit on MSNBC
[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:29.500]  and CNN that info wars
[1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:30.500]  is the beta test
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:31.500]  they also said
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:32.500]  in documents came out
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:33.500]  of the Wall Street Journal
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:34.500]  four plus years ago
[1:47:34.600 --> 1:47:35.500]  ahead of my deplatforming
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.500]  that WikiLeaks was a model
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:39.500]  they said if we could shut down
[1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:41.500]  WikiLeaks and shut down Alex Jones
[1:47:41.600 --> 1:47:42.500]  the left wing and right wing
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:43.500]  will be silenced
[1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:45.400]  we can get them all
[1:47:45.500 --> 1:47:47.400]  and so now we have judge orders
[1:47:47.500 --> 1:47:49.400]  Alex Jones to pay one million
[1:47:49.500 --> 1:47:51.400]  in fees to four Sandy Hook parents
[1:47:51.500 --> 1:47:53.400]  so I'm found guilty
[1:47:53.500 --> 1:47:55.400]  before I have a trial
[1:47:55.500 --> 1:47:56.400]  a default
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.400]  then they say pay a million dollars
[1:47:58.500 --> 1:47:59.400]  we put it to the
[1:47:59.500 --> 1:48:00.400]  appeals court
[1:48:00.500 --> 1:48:01.400]  within one day
[1:48:01.500 --> 1:48:02.400]  they shoot it back
[1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:03.400]  unprecedented
[1:48:03.500 --> 1:48:05.400]  usually takes six months
[1:48:05.500 --> 1:48:06.400]  and we paid it
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:07.400]  people say well
[1:48:07.500 --> 1:48:08.400]  why'd you pay that
[1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:10.400]  well she'll put me in jail
[1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:11.400]  why do you live in Austin
[1:48:11.500 --> 1:48:12.400]  well my family's from here
[1:48:12.400 --> 1:48:13.300]  we helped found the state
[1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:15.300]  you know I live here
[1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:16.300]  in hindsight I've been
[1:48:16.400 --> 1:48:17.300]  in a conservative county
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:18.300]  believe me we're going to try
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.300]  to get money and move out of
[1:48:19.400 --> 1:48:20.300]  here
[1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:21.300]  but
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:23.300]  now they're like oh
[1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:24.300]  we're going to talk about
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:25.300]  white supremacism
[1:48:25.400 --> 1:48:26.300]  so at this trial
[1:48:26.400 --> 1:48:28.300]  where I'm guilty
[1:48:28.400 --> 1:48:30.300]  already found guilty
[1:48:30.400 --> 1:48:31.300]  the judge
[1:48:31.400 --> 1:48:32.300]  and her order is public
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:33.300]  I'm going to show you
[1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:34.300]  the documents here in a moment
[1:48:34.400 --> 1:48:36.300]  has said that I can't discuss
[1:48:36.400 --> 1:48:37.300]  free speech
[1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:38.300]  I can't discuss show trials
[1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:40.300]  I can't say I'm innocent
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:41.300]  I have to come and say
[1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:43.200]  I'm guilty at a trial
[1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:44.200]  or she'll sanction me
[1:48:44.300 --> 1:48:45.200]  and then she threatens
[1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:46.200]  all the lawyers
[1:48:46.300 --> 1:48:47.200]  who've been on the case
[1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:48.200]  off of it
[1:48:48.300 --> 1:48:50.200]  so here it is
[1:48:50.300 --> 1:48:52.200]  news times
[1:48:52.300 --> 1:48:53.200]  judge orders Alex Jones
[1:48:53.300 --> 1:48:54.200]  to pay one million
[1:48:54.300 --> 1:48:56.200]  in fees before Sandy Hook
[1:48:56.300 --> 1:48:57.200]  parents
[1:48:57.300 --> 1:48:58.200]  we paid it
[1:48:58.300 --> 1:49:00.200]  because
[1:49:00.300 --> 1:49:02.200]  they'll put us in jail
[1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:04.200]  that's where we're at
[1:49:04.300 --> 1:49:05.200]  Alex Jones with one million
[1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:06.200]  in court fees
[1:49:06.300 --> 1:49:08.200]  over Sandy Hook
[1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:09.200]  and they put
[1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:10.200]  Parkland losses
[1:49:10.200 --> 1:49:12.100]  we weren't involved in that
[1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:13.100]  out
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:14.100]  Texas judge orders Alex Jones
[1:49:14.200 --> 1:49:15.100]  to pay one million in legal
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:16.100]  fees
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:18.100]  and it goes on from there
[1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.100]  Alex Jones ordered
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:20.100]  to cough up a hundred
[1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:21.100]  a million
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:22.100]  Texas court denies
[1:49:22.200 --> 1:49:24.100]  Alex Jones bid
[1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.100]  sanctions delay bid
[1:49:27.200 --> 1:49:32.100]  and it goes on from there
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:33.100]  then they come out
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:34.100]  and they say
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:35.100]  denied
[1:49:35.200 --> 1:49:36.100]  court refuses Alex Jones
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:37.100]  request to deny
[1:49:37.200 --> 1:49:38.100]  paying one million
[1:49:38.200 --> 1:49:39.100]  and then they go
[1:49:39.100 --> 1:49:40.000]  lawyers want to bar
[1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.000]  all mention of white supremacy
[1:49:42.100 --> 1:49:43.000]  and we said to the court
[1:49:43.100 --> 1:49:44.000]  hey we have footage
[1:49:44.100 --> 1:49:45.000]  of me protesting the Klan
[1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:46.000]  sorry can't show that
[1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:47.000]  we're going to say
[1:49:47.100 --> 1:49:48.000]  you're a white supremac
[1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:49.000]  they've designated
[1:49:49.100 --> 1:49:50.000]  their experts and said
[1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:51.000]  they're going to
[1:49:51.100 --> 1:49:52.000]  say I'm a white supremac
[1:49:52.100 --> 1:49:53.000]  with no evidence
[1:49:53.100 --> 1:49:54.000]  and then we can't respond
[1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:55.000]  so they're not just saying
[1:49:55.100 --> 1:49:56.000]  I'm guilty
[1:49:56.100 --> 1:49:57.000]  go to a jury
[1:49:57.100 --> 1:49:58.000]  it's all rigged
[1:49:58.100 --> 1:49:59.000]  Alex Jones
[1:49:59.100 --> 1:50:00.000]  doesn't want to talk
[1:50:00.100 --> 1:50:01.000]  about white supremacy
[1:50:01.100 --> 1:50:02.000]  and it goes on
[1:50:02.100 --> 1:50:03.000]  from there
[1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:05.000]  there's vice
[1:50:05.100 --> 1:50:07.000]  there's all of it
[1:50:07.100 --> 1:50:08.000]  so talk about
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:08.900]  tanning a jury pool
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.900]  talk about rigging things
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:12.900]  this is the model
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.900]  for everybody else
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:16.900]  and it's so unbelievable
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:17.900]  no one's ever seen this
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:18.900]  in US history
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:19.900]  but now the Democrats
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:20.900]  are saying their case
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:21.900]  against me
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:22.900]  is the model against
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:23.900]  Fox News
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:24.900]  Tucker Carlson
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:25.900]  Tucker Trump
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:26.900]  Donald Trump
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:27.900]  everybody else
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:28.900]  Robert Barnes
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:29.900]  you've been involved
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:30.900]  in this since day one
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:31.900]  you've worked on the case
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:32.900]  what is really going on
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:33.900]  two things
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:34.900]  one is that they built
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:35.900]  up a fake news narrative
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:36.900]  the fake narrative
[1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:38.800]  was to blame you
[1:50:38.900 --> 1:50:39.800]  for everything that
[1:50:39.900 --> 1:50:40.800]  related to anybody
[1:50:40.900 --> 1:50:41.800]  who second guessed
[1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:42.800]  what took place at Sandy Hook
[1:50:42.900 --> 1:50:43.800]  but also
[1:50:43.900 --> 1:50:44.800]  and we now see with you
[1:50:44.900 --> 1:50:45.800]  Valde the importance
[1:50:45.900 --> 1:50:46.800]  of second guessing
[1:50:46.900 --> 1:50:47.800]  what takes place
[1:50:47.900 --> 1:50:48.800]  in a school shooting
[1:50:48.900 --> 1:50:49.800]  environment
[1:50:49.900 --> 1:50:50.800]  because the initial
[1:50:50.900 --> 1:50:51.800]  narrative with you
[1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:52.800]  Valde said the cops
[1:50:52.900 --> 1:50:53.800]  didn't do anything wrong
[1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:54.800]  school officials
[1:50:54.900 --> 1:50:55.800]  didn't do anything wrong
[1:50:55.900 --> 1:50:56.800]  nobody
[1:50:56.900 --> 1:50:57.800]  no politician
[1:50:57.900 --> 1:50:58.800]  did anything wrong
[1:50:58.900 --> 1:50:59.800]  in fact now we know
[1:50:59.900 --> 1:51:00.800]  they did a lot wrong
[1:51:00.900 --> 1:51:01.800]  we only know that
[1:51:01.900 --> 1:51:02.800]  because people
[1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:03.800]  were willing to ask
[1:51:03.900 --> 1:51:04.800]  questions that
[1:51:04.900 --> 1:51:05.800]  they're trying to use
[1:51:05.800 --> 1:51:06.700]  you're not allowed
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:07.700]  to ask questions
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:08.700]  that was part of it
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:09.700]  the other part of it
[1:51:09.800 --> 1:51:10.700]  was the fake narrative
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:11.700]  was to blame you
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:12.700]  for anybody who
[1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:13.700]  second guessed
[1:51:13.800 --> 1:51:14.700]  what took place
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:15.700]  at Sandy Hook
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:16.700]  even though
[1:51:16.800 --> 1:51:17.700]  Info Wars
[1:51:17.800 --> 1:51:18.700]  99.9% of what
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:19.700]  Info Wars ever published
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:20.700]  or produced
[1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:21.700]  said that
[1:51:21.800 --> 1:51:22.700]  what happened
[1:51:22.800 --> 1:51:23.700]  at Sandy Hook
[1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:24.700]  happened
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:25.700]  it simply raised
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:26.700]  questions as to
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:27.700]  drug complicity
[1:51:27.800 --> 1:51:28.700]  raised questions
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:29.700]  as to school official
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:30.700]  safety complicity
[1:51:30.800 --> 1:51:31.700]  raised questions
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:32.700]  about whether
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:33.700]  why they were hiding
[1:51:33.800 --> 1:51:34.700]  information
[1:51:34.700 --> 1:51:35.600]  many of those kids
[1:51:35.700 --> 1:51:36.600]  would be alive today
[1:51:36.700 --> 1:51:37.600]  and the politicians
[1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:38.600]  done their job
[1:51:38.700 --> 1:51:39.600]  and used the money
[1:51:39.700 --> 1:51:40.600]  correctly
[1:51:40.700 --> 1:51:41.600]  they need to keep all
[1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:42.600]  of that hidden
[1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:43.600]  and blame the gun
[1:51:43.700 --> 1:51:44.600]  instead
[1:51:44.700 --> 1:51:45.600]  but that's not all
[1:51:45.700 --> 1:51:46.600]  the next level
[1:51:46.700 --> 1:51:47.600]  template with this
[1:51:47.700 --> 1:51:48.600]  was to use this
[1:51:48.700 --> 1:51:49.600]  to suppress
[1:51:49.700 --> 1:51:50.600]  and censor
[1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:51.600]  dissident speech
[1:51:51.700 --> 1:51:52.600]  and particularly
[1:51:52.700 --> 1:51:53.600]  Info Wars has been
[1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:54.600]  the tip of the spear
[1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:55.600]  imagine if they had
[1:51:55.700 --> 1:51:56.600]  been successful
[1:51:56.700 --> 1:51:57.600]  imagine if Info Wars
[1:51:57.700 --> 1:51:58.600]  had not been here
[1:51:58.700 --> 1:51:59.600]  when the lockdowns
[1:51:59.700 --> 1:52:00.600]  occurred
[1:52:00.700 --> 1:52:01.600]  imagine if Info Wars
[1:52:01.700 --> 1:52:02.600]  had not been here
[1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:03.600]  when the mask mandates
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:05.500]  passed across the country
[1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:06.500]  took place
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:07.500]  would there have been
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:08.500]  major public protests
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:09.500]  because every public
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:10.500]  protest took place
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:11.500]  being led by Info Wars
[1:52:11.600 --> 1:52:12.500]  supporters and fans
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:13.500]  who listened to the audience
[1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:15.500]  who listened to Info Wars
[1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:16.500]  so their goal
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:17.500]  was to remove Info Wars
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:18.500]  and its audience
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:19.500]  from political
[1:52:19.600 --> 1:52:20.500]  and public participation
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:21.500]  awareness and knowledge
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:22.500]  and it was to use
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:23.500]  this suit
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:24.500]  to do so
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:25.500]  to try to
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:26.500]  censor
[1:52:26.600 --> 1:52:27.500]  and suppress
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:28.500]  independent media
[1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:29.500]  and so even though
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:30.500]  the evidence didn't matter
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:31.500]  people asked well
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:32.500]  how are you
[1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:34.400]  hearing I'm already guilty
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:35.400]  now how guilty
[1:52:35.500 --> 1:52:36.400]  that's in her order too
[1:52:36.500 --> 1:52:38.400]  I mean it's insane
[1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:39.400]  completely
[1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:40.400]  she's got to hide
[1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:41.400]  what she did
[1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:42.400]  absolutely
[1:52:42.500 --> 1:52:43.400]  she's so arrogant
[1:52:43.500 --> 1:52:44.400]  well if they had
[1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:45.400]  I mean here they are
[1:52:45.500 --> 1:52:46.400]  in Austin Texas
[1:52:46.500 --> 1:52:47.400]  one of the most liberal
[1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:48.400]  jurisdictions in America
[1:52:48.500 --> 1:52:49.400]  one of the most pro-gun
[1:52:49.500 --> 1:52:50.400]  controlled jurisdictions
[1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:51.400]  in America
[1:52:51.500 --> 1:52:52.400]  one of the most
[1:52:52.500 --> 1:52:53.400]  media believing
[1:52:53.500 --> 1:52:55.400]  jury polls in America
[1:52:55.500 --> 1:52:57.400]  and yet they were scared
[1:52:57.500 --> 1:52:58.400]  of even an Austin
[1:52:58.500 --> 1:52:59.400]  liberal jury
[1:52:59.500 --> 1:53:00.400]  hearing the actual
[1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:02.300]  facts of the case
[1:53:02.400 --> 1:53:03.300]  facts of the case
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:04.300]  that go counter
[1:53:04.400 --> 1:53:05.300]  to the media's narrative
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:06.300]  about this case
[1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:07.300]  and so even the
[1:53:07.400 --> 1:53:08.300]  Austin courts
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:10.300]  and the Connecticut courts
[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:11.300]  were too scared
[1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:12.300]  and terrified
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:13.300]  and their lawyers
[1:53:13.400 --> 1:53:14.300]  and the other people
[1:53:14.400 --> 1:53:15.300]  involved were too
[1:53:15.400 --> 1:53:16.300]  terrified of even
[1:53:16.400 --> 1:53:17.300]  a liberal jury
[1:53:17.400 --> 1:53:18.300]  a liberal democratic
[1:53:18.400 --> 1:53:19.300]  jury poll
[1:53:19.400 --> 1:53:20.300]  hearing the actual
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:21.300]  facts
[1:53:21.400 --> 1:53:22.300]  probably because
[1:53:22.400 --> 1:53:23.300]  those actual facts
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:25.300]  rebut rather than support
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:26.300]  the official
[1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:27.300]  and institutional
[1:53:27.400 --> 1:53:28.300]  and the judge issues
[1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:29.300]  an order
[1:53:29.300 --> 1:53:31.200]  talk about it in court
[1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:32.200]  yeah
[1:53:32.300 --> 1:53:33.200]  I mean it's basically
[1:53:33.300 --> 1:53:34.200]  it's the Chicago
[1:53:34.300 --> 1:53:35.200]  7 on steroid
[1:53:35.300 --> 1:53:36.200]  because even the
[1:53:36.300 --> 1:53:37.200]  Chicago 7 was allowed
[1:53:37.300 --> 1:53:38.200]  to defend themselves
[1:53:38.300 --> 1:53:39.200]  on the merits
[1:53:39.300 --> 1:53:40.200]  so here you're not only
[1:53:40.300 --> 1:53:41.200]  getting gagged like
[1:53:41.300 --> 1:53:42.200]  Bobby Seale
[1:53:42.300 --> 1:53:43.200]  your own lawyers are
[1:53:43.300 --> 1:53:44.200]  not even allowed
[1:53:44.300 --> 1:53:45.200]  and the jury is not even
[1:53:45.300 --> 1:53:46.200]  allowed to consider
[1:53:46.300 --> 1:53:47.200]  whether you're actually
[1:53:47.300 --> 1:53:48.200]  guilty or not
[1:53:48.300 --> 1:53:49.200]  you are presumed
[1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:50.200]  and judged guilty
[1:53:50.300 --> 1:53:51.200]  without ever being
[1:53:51.300 --> 1:53:52.200]  you are guilty
[1:53:52.300 --> 1:53:53.200]  until proven how guilty
[1:53:53.300 --> 1:53:54.200]  exactly
[1:53:54.300 --> 1:53:55.200]  not innocent
[1:53:55.300 --> 1:53:56.200]  until proven guilty
[1:53:56.300 --> 1:53:57.200]  not guilty
[1:53:57.300 --> 1:53:58.200]  until proven innocent
[1:53:58.200 --> 1:53:59.100]  you are guilty
[1:53:59.200 --> 1:54:00.100]  until proven how guilty
[1:54:00.200 --> 1:54:01.100]  and you can't talk
[1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:02.100]  about how it's
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:03.100]  a kangaroo court
[1:54:03.200 --> 1:54:04.100]  I mean the arrogance
[1:54:04.200 --> 1:54:05.100]  but they've got to win
[1:54:05.200 --> 1:54:06.100]  they didn't find
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:07.100]  what they said
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:08.100]  so they've got to do this
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:09.100]  oh it's all an endorsement
[1:54:09.200 --> 1:54:10.100]  at a core level
[1:54:10.200 --> 1:54:11.100]  because if they were
[1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:12.100]  in the right
[1:54:12.200 --> 1:54:13.100]  factually morally
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:14.100]  and legally
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:15.100]  they would not be
[1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:16.100]  rigging the game
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:18.100]  to fix the outcome
[1:54:18.200 --> 1:54:19.100]  they would be having
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:20.100]  a full robust
[1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:21.100]  jury selection
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:22.100]  they would be having
[1:54:22.200 --> 1:54:23.100]  a full debate
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:24.100]  and trial on the
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:25.100]  substantive merits
[1:54:25.200 --> 1:54:26.100]  they would allow you
[1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:27.100]  to introduce
[1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:28.000]  your defenses
[1:54:28.100 --> 1:54:29.000]  go back and read
[1:54:29.100 --> 1:54:30.000]  the great Clarence Darrow
[1:54:30.100 --> 1:54:31.000]  closing arguments
[1:54:31.100 --> 1:54:32.000]  often they would go
[1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:33.000]  eight days long
[1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:34.000]  closing arguments
[1:54:34.100 --> 1:54:35.000]  in which he would talk
[1:54:35.100 --> 1:54:36.000]  about everything
[1:54:36.100 --> 1:54:37.000]  go back to Patrick Henry
[1:54:37.100 --> 1:54:38.000]  give me liberty
[1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:39.000]  or give me death
[1:54:39.100 --> 1:54:40.000]  but no, no, no
[1:54:40.100 --> 1:54:41.000]  let me show you
[1:54:41.100 --> 1:54:42.000]  in fact I've got it
[1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:43.000]  right here on the stack
[1:54:43.100 --> 1:54:44.000]  we'll pull it out
[1:54:44.100 --> 1:54:45.000]  when we come back
[1:54:45.100 --> 1:54:46.000]  we're going to do more
[1:54:46.100 --> 1:54:47.000]  on this tomorrow
[1:54:47.100 --> 1:54:48.000]  because this is a big deal
[1:54:48.100 --> 1:54:49.000]  for the end of American
[1:54:49.100 --> 1:54:50.000]  freedom
[1:54:50.100 --> 1:54:51.000]  we have the actual
[1:54:51.100 --> 1:54:52.000]  judges orders
[1:54:52.100 --> 1:54:53.000]  right here
[1:54:53.100 --> 1:54:54.000]  okay
[1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:55.000]  and imagine the
[1:54:55.100 --> 1:54:56.000]  media's discipline
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:56.900]  over a month
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:57.900]  they won't cover this
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:54:59.900]  saying
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:00.900]  it says
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:01.900]  no discussion
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:02.900]  of the First Amendment
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:03.900]  no discussion
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:04.900]  that you're innocent
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:05.900]  says that
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:06.900]  in your defense
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:07.900]  you can't say you're
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:08.900]  innocent
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:09.900]  and then they'll
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:10.900]  sanction the lawyers
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:11.900]  if they don't go along
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:12.900]  with that
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:13.900]  unbelievable Robert
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:14.900]  yeah it's completely
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:15.900]  it's Patrick Henry
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:16.900]  established
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:17.900]  and his give me liberty
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:18.900]  or give me death
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:19.900]  closing argument
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:20.900]  defense
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:21.900]  to a tobacco
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:22.900]  tax charge
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:23.900]  the jury was allowed
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:24.900]  to hear everything
[1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:25.800]  so what is our system's
[1:55:25.900 --> 1:55:26.800]  response been to that
[1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:27.800]  it's been for the court
[1:55:27.900 --> 1:55:29.800]  system to hijack
[1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:30.800]  the jury function
[1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:31.800]  the jury role
[1:55:31.900 --> 1:55:32.800]  in these trials
[1:55:32.900 --> 1:55:33.800]  and tell the jury
[1:55:33.900 --> 1:55:34.800]  this person's guilty
[1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:35.800]  he can't talk
[1:55:35.900 --> 1:55:36.800]  now getting
[1:55:36.900 --> 1:55:37.800]  exactly
[1:55:37.900 --> 1:55:38.800]  that's exactly
[1:55:38.900 --> 1:55:39.800]  what's taking place
[1:55:39.900 --> 1:55:40.800]  and the fact that
[1:55:40.900 --> 1:55:41.800]  they have to do that
[1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:42.800]  even in Austin
[1:55:42.900 --> 1:55:43.800]  tells you how much
[1:55:43.900 --> 1:55:44.800]  they know
[1:55:44.900 --> 1:55:45.800]  that they would not win
[1:55:45.900 --> 1:55:46.800]  in an independent
[1:55:46.900 --> 1:55:47.800]  fair trial
[1:55:47.900 --> 1:55:48.800]  impartial jury
[1:55:48.900 --> 1:55:50.800]  would not give them
[1:55:50.900 --> 1:55:51.800]  the verdict they want
[1:55:51.900 --> 1:55:52.800]  they would rebut
[1:55:52.900 --> 1:55:53.800]  the verdict they want
[1:55:53.800 --> 1:55:54.700]  they got Connecticut
[1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:55.700]  and these judges
[1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:56.700]  mirroring their rulings
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:57.700]  completely
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:58.700]  I mean it's embarrassment
[1:55:58.800 --> 1:56:00.700]  I've said Alex Jones
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:01.700]  is not on trial
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:02.700]  in these cases
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:03.700]  the American judicial system
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:04.700]  is on trial
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:05.700]  in these cases
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:06.700]  and sadly the verdict
[1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:07.700]  so far as the American
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:08.700]  justice system
[1:56:08.800 --> 1:56:09.700]  is guilty of
[1:56:09.800 --> 1:56:10.700]  partiality
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:11.700]  and prejudice
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:12.700]  in the incapacity
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:13.700]  to enforce the law
[1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:14.700]  in these cases
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:15.700]  and they don't realize it
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:16.700]  or recognize it
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:17.700]  or appreciate it
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:18.700]  hopefully at some point
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:19.700]  a higher court
[1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:20.700]  does something about it
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:21.700]  but in the interim
[1:56:21.800 --> 1:56:22.700]  they want to try to do
[1:56:22.700 --> 1:56:23.600]  the voice of Alex Jones
[1:56:23.700 --> 1:56:24.600]  from being heard
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:25.600]  and from anyone else
[1:56:25.700 --> 1:56:27.600]  becoming like Alex Jones
[1:56:27.700 --> 1:56:28.600]  they're doing
[1:56:28.700 --> 1:56:29.600]  what they did to Julian
[1:56:29.700 --> 1:56:30.600]  to send a message
[1:56:30.700 --> 1:56:31.600]  exactly
[1:56:31.700 --> 1:56:32.600]  they want to Julian
[1:56:32.700 --> 1:56:33.600]  to send you
[1:56:33.700 --> 1:56:34.600]  let's talk about that
[1:56:34.700 --> 1:56:35.600]  when we come back
[1:56:35.700 --> 1:56:36.600]  I'm going to read to you
[1:56:36.700 --> 1:56:37.600]  with the documents
[1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:38.600]  about just telling you
[1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:39.600]  they said this
[1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:40.600]  it's hard to believe
[1:56:40.700 --> 1:56:41.600]  they actually did it
[1:56:41.700 --> 1:56:42.600]  separately
[1:56:42.700 --> 1:56:43.600]  we need funds to fight
[1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:44.600]  these three kangaroo courts
[1:56:44.700 --> 1:56:45.600]  because on appeal
[1:56:45.700 --> 1:56:46.600]  we'll beat them
[1:56:46.700 --> 1:56:47.600]  plus it's going to blow
[1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:48.600]  up on their face politically
[1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:49.600]  we're going to go into this
[1:56:49.700 --> 1:56:50.600]  we're ready
[1:56:50.700 --> 1:56:51.600]  we're going to win
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:53.500]  Glen before they get run
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:54.500]  playing

[1:59:07.220 --> 1:59:11.940]  anti-fat weight loss products that are out there. We went and looked at the top 10,
[1:59:11.940 --> 1:59:17.860]  they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product. But with our new product from
[1:59:17.860 --> 1:59:26.820]  X7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences that's just

[1:59:32.180 --> 1:59:37.380]  in the last three months and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise. Well now

[1:59:43.540 --> 1:59:47.780]  infowarstore.com diet force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[1:59:47.780 --> 2:00:11.220]  Let me show viewers, we're going to be putting press releases out the next few days.
[2:00:11.220 --> 2:00:18.020]  What they've done and now it ties into the whole January 6th fiasco and more.
[2:00:19.300 --> 2:00:24.340]  We've been denied our fundamental constitutional due process rights to present a defense in
[2:00:24.340 --> 2:00:31.220]  Texas or Connecticut. Both Guerra Gamble in Texas, a judge Barbara Bellis in Connecticut
[2:00:31.220 --> 2:00:34.900]  have denied us our first-minute rights. He's willing to provide enough discovery which we
[2:00:34.900 --> 2:00:39.620]  give him everything. Neither judge can deny that he responded to scourge, that is rule that was
[2:00:39.620 --> 2:00:44.580]  insufficient. The effect of these rulings incredibly you have been found guilty by two
[2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:51.140]  judges who never even held trials or had any evidence and it goes on. They say that we cannot
[2:00:51.140 --> 2:00:58.660]  discuss the First Amendment, we cannot discuss it we're innocent or say it's a kangaroo trial.
[2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:04.820]  Mentioning the First Amendment or freedom of expression those are quotes arguing that the
[2:01:04.820 --> 2:01:09.460]  plaintiffs' mental anguish was caused by Adam Lanza, the shooter and not by your reporting.
[2:01:10.180 --> 2:01:14.420]  Can't say Adam Lanza killed the kids, I killed him. Asserting that plaintiffs have become prominent
[2:01:14.420 --> 2:01:18.980]  public figures by appearing on television testifying before Congress or giving TED talks
[2:01:18.980 --> 2:01:24.580]  and publishing books or selling merchandise. Arguing that our statements were not outrageous,
[2:01:24.580 --> 2:01:30.660]  suggesting the trial was in any way unfair. Folks, no one's ever done this in U.S. history,
[2:01:30.660 --> 2:01:34.980]  but the Democrats are losing, they're desperate. And here it is, plaintiffs' emotions and limiting.
[2:01:36.020 --> 2:01:40.420]  The judge approved it and they try to get her to walk it back at pre-trial. She said,
[2:01:40.420 --> 2:01:45.300]  well I'm not sure, I'll see what I'm going to do. Here it all is, Travis County filed overhead
[2:01:45.300 --> 2:01:50.980]  shot pleas. This will all be published tomorrow, it'll all be out for everybody. Robert Barnes,
[2:01:50.980 --> 2:01:54.660]  you said there's ties into January 6th. Closing comments on this, we'll be back tomorrow with
[2:01:54.660 --> 2:01:59.940]  us in the studio. Even Soviet style show trials would be embarrassed by what is taking place in
[2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:05.620]  either the January 6th hearings, the January 6th trials, or the Alex Jones cases in either Texas
[2:02:05.620 --> 2:02:10.420]  or Connecticut. It is a complete deprival and denial of basic court constitutional rights.
[2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:14.660]  It's an invention of law that in many cases doesn't exist like the misapplication of the
[2:02:14.660 --> 2:02:20.180]  obstruction statute that's taking place to January 6th defendants. Imagine a high-ranking lawyer was
[2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:25.940]  caught perjuring and falsifying and forging documents in order to illicitly spy on American
[2:02:25.940 --> 2:02:31.620]  presidential candidate and his supporters. And he got no time in prison at all and got to keep
[2:02:31.620 --> 2:02:38.020]  his law license. By contrast, grandmothers with cancer are sent to prison for months in hardcore
[2:02:38.020 --> 2:02:43.780]  facilities in the United States merely for walking around the Capitol without the permission of
[2:02:43.780 --> 2:02:47.940]  Speaker of the House Pelosi. These people are maniacs. Completely. It is a complete denial. What
[2:02:47.940 --> 2:02:52.260]  took place in your case is a denial of First Amendment rights of association, denial of First
[2:02:52.260 --> 2:02:56.500]  Amendment rights of free speech, denial of First Amendment rights of free press, denial of Second
[2:02:56.500 --> 2:03:00.580]  Amendment rights to self-defense. And they're saying I'm a white supremacist in the news and I
[2:03:00.580 --> 2:03:04.580]  can't talk at the I'm convicted show trial and they're going to say I'm a white supremacist
[2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.900]  of the jury and we can't show me protests in the KKK, she said. Well, and some of these discovery
[2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:12.260]  orders really are in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the rights to protect against
[2:03:12.260 --> 2:03:16.820]  privacy outside of probable cause of a crime. Fifth Amendment deprival of your due process
[2:03:16.820 --> 2:03:21.860]  rights. Seventh Amendment denial of your jury trial rights, which are protected independently
[2:03:21.860 --> 2:03:25.620]  and separately under the Texas State Constitution and a million dollar fine. So it shows how desperate
[2:03:25.620 --> 2:03:30.980]  they are. Completely. This is an effort to rail. What I've said is January 6th and the Alex Jones
[2:03:30.980 --> 2:03:36.580]  trials look like 19th century Australia, all kangaroos and railroads. And that is precisely
[2:03:36.580 --> 2:03:41.860]  what it has been to date. And the question is, will the courts wake up to recognizing that they
[2:03:41.860 --> 2:03:47.460]  and their legal system of America is as much on trial around the globe as Alex Jones. It's just
[2:03:47.460 --> 2:03:51.700]  like the corporate media's collapse and the FBI's collapse. They're just killing all their credibility
[2:03:51.700 --> 2:03:56.740]  forever. Absolutely. They're exposing themselves. If they had confidence in the facts or the law
[2:03:56.740 --> 2:04:01.380]  or their moral narrative, they would want a liberal Austin jury to hear all the facts,
[2:04:01.380 --> 2:04:06.900]  all the evidence and all the arguments. The fact they're terrified of allowing even that to occur
[2:04:06.900 --> 2:04:11.460]  tells you that even they know that they're in the wrong factually. Robert, could you imagine
[2:04:11.460 --> 2:04:15.860]  we'll be back tomorrow that that they would put in an order you can't talk about free speech or
[2:04:15.860 --> 2:04:20.660]  say you're innocent? It's extraordinary. All of it. I mean, all of it's unparalleled. Denial of
[2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:24.020]  your rights to bring any slap motions. Denial of your rights to bring motions to dismiss.
[2:04:24.020 --> 2:04:27.940]  Denial of your rights to bring summary judgment motions. Denial of your rights to appeal
[2:04:27.940 --> 2:04:32.500]  to denial of those rights in Texas and Connecticut, fundamentally in court. We're going to do a lot of,
[2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:35.860]  you're going to be here in the next few weeks off and on. You've got a lot of Texas cases with your
[2:04:35.860 --> 2:04:40.580]  big Pfizer stuff. Robert Barnes, thank you so much. We've got 10 seconds. How do people find your show?
[2:04:40.580 --> 2:04:46.020]  Sure. Then go to VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com. Or just search engine Robert Barnes. That's it. And
[2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:50.820]  you're on Twitter. Great job, buddy. All right, Jacob Ingalls and the great Owen Schreuer coming
[2:04:50.820 --> 2:05:02.180]  in live to cover the waterfront. Stay with us. The globalists are doing everything they can to
[2:05:02.180 --> 2:05:08.020]  destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages. And if you
[2:05:08.020 --> 2:05:14.100]  look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men
[2:05:14.100 --> 2:05:19.380]  cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom. It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're
[2:05:19.380 --> 2:05:24.020]  like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one point, another two, that's just the
[2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:27.540]  truth. The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true. But whether you
[2:05:27.540 --> 2:05:32.900]  rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis, InstaHeart is the number one best selling
[2:05:32.900 --> 2:05:38.340]  natural herbal supplement in the world when it comes to male enhancement, because it really

[2:06:04.020 --> 2:06:19.540]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:24.020]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline against
[2:06:24.020 --> 2:06:32.100]  myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day. Jones admits he's an actor, or Tucker Carlson says
[2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:38.740]  nobody would take me seriously. Where do we say that? We never said that. They just say we said
[2:06:38.740 --> 2:06:44.660]  that. But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say that? It doesn't exist.
[2:06:44.660 --> 2:06:49.140]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[2:06:49.140 --> 2:06:56.740]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show. The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[2:06:56.740 --> 2:07:01.780]  He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist. Alex Jones is a fake.
[2:07:02.340 --> 2:07:07.780]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid, and it's all based on
[2:07:08.420 --> 2:07:13.700]  custody battle Max's wife five years ago, and she was trying to put into evidence to be dressed up
[2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:18.580]  more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic saying take your prozac kids,
[2:07:18.580 --> 2:07:23.700]  take your illegal drugs too, you'll die, it's fun, so people wouldn't take drugs.
[2:07:24.580 --> 2:07:28.660]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence. They look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs,
[2:07:28.660 --> 2:07:34.260]  and my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really
[2:07:34.260 --> 2:07:42.980]  Jack Nicholson. So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or the Joker,
[2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:54.820]  because I can do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader. Do I really think I'm
[2:07:54.820 --> 2:08:00.580]  Darth Vader? No. Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, the Joker? No. And clearly,
[2:08:01.380 --> 2:08:06.740]  no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really
[2:08:06.740 --> 2:08:12.420]  think. No one believes the Babylon B, it's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:17.780]  By the Vaccinate Meow Modal today, it's required by the CDC. But they play those games,
[2:08:18.660 --> 2:08:22.660]  and that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to. Even though I tell people, okay,
[2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:29.220]  this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out, and they say, no, this is what he really
[2:08:29.220 --> 2:08:34.420]  believes. Every day when I leave work, I do this. That man's a threat to this country. And they go,
[2:08:34.420 --> 2:08:39.140]  look, he admitted in court, he's an actor. Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly,
[2:08:39.140 --> 2:08:43.700]  I was an actor in Waking Life, I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[2:08:45.780 --> 2:08:51.620]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you
[2:08:51.620 --> 2:08:56.500]  isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually saying. And you know that. You're insulted
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:09:02.180]  right now, I'm even explaining that to you. And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[2:09:02.180 --> 2:09:08.980]  You don't know the power of the dark side. Am I really Darth Vader?
[2:09:10.180 --> 2:09:15.940]  Nick Alex Jones seems really talented, he's smart, he's funny as hell, he's truly funny.
[2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:16.900]  I'm kind of retarded.
[2:09:25.140 --> 2:09:31.780]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, you now not listen to what I say
[2:09:31.780 --> 2:09:37.700]  about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on infowars.com.
[2:09:37.700 --> 2:09:43.300]  It has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome. No, that's
[2:09:43.300 --> 2:09:49.220]  a real thing. That's something happening in the real world. And that's what we're breaking down
[2:09:49.220 --> 2:09:56.820]  here today. I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day. I am an American, and that's
[2:09:56.820 --> 2:10:01.620]  what I promote is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[2:10:12.260 --> 2:10:13.780]  Pesky Earth Creatures.
[2:10:20.180 --> 2:10:24.900]  I'm Alex Jones. The story you're about to see is truth. This is reality.
[2:10:24.900 --> 2:10:32.020]  Truth is stranger than fiction. I'm the most banned, most demonized media person in the world.
[2:10:32.020 --> 2:10:37.300]  Alex Jones is a fake, and he's a performance artist. I'm perceived as a clown, to nut, to maniac.
[2:10:38.660 --> 2:10:41.540]  On his website, infowars, he touted...
[2:10:41.540 --> 2:10:45.860]  Aaron Neuerborn, the sickest, most offensive theory.
[2:10:46.420 --> 2:10:52.020]  Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[2:10:52.020 --> 2:10:55.700]  Don't you stand for America, sir? He said me and Hillary are demons.
[2:10:57.620 --> 2:10:58.900]  Ain't that something?
[2:10:58.900 --> 2:10:59.940]  You're burning hell!
[2:11:00.660 --> 2:11:05.220]  I met him back in 1990. I knew right away he was going to be a star.
[2:11:05.220 --> 2:11:06.020]  How's my hair look?
[2:11:06.020 --> 2:11:09.060]  I saw all these conspiracy theorists that were talking about the new world order.
[2:11:09.060 --> 2:11:10.100]  And I thought, that's what I'll do.
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:11.220]  Hey, Alex.
[2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:13.780]  Death to the new world order!
[2:11:13.780 --> 2:11:17.700]  Was that attack on humanity that I saw early on that I really wanted to wage war on?
[2:11:17.700 --> 2:11:19.620]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[2:11:19.620 --> 2:11:22.020]  When she tastes that, there's no going back.
[2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:28.500]  Everything's a war. That's the way the universe works, and everything is propaganda.
[2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:33.540]  I don't trust Donald Trump, but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says.
[2:11:33.540 --> 2:11:36.900]  Your reputation's amazing. I will not let you down.
[2:11:38.260 --> 2:11:39.860]  That's when the media took the gloves off.
[2:11:40.820 --> 2:11:45.700]  Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children, was fake.
[2:11:45.700 --> 2:11:48.100]  I try to tell the truth, and sometimes I'm wrong.
[2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:49.780]  Did the New York Times get in trouble?
[2:11:49.780 --> 2:11:53.060]  Were consciously lying about WMDs that then led to a war?
[2:11:53.060 --> 2:11:54.820]  Killed tens of thousands in conflict? No.
[2:11:56.100 --> 2:11:58.260]  The attempts to be platformers have failed.
[2:11:58.260 --> 2:12:00.980]  They've had the CIA and the FBI following me around.
[2:12:00.980 --> 2:12:04.020]  Now we've got to destroy Alex Jones. We're not playing games here.
[2:12:04.020 --> 2:12:07.140]  This is such a historic moment together.
[2:12:07.140 --> 2:12:09.780]  USA! USA!
[2:12:09.780 --> 2:12:10.740]  It's all just insane.
[2:12:11.620 --> 2:12:14.820]  Okay, let's put me in prison for questioning, okay, even though that's my right.
[2:12:14.820 --> 2:12:16.180]  In fact, let's execute Alex Jones.
[2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:18.740]  Let's put him in front of a firing squad, pull the trigger.
[2:12:20.580 --> 2:12:23.620]  I have a sick feeling, actually, because I know what comes next.
[2:12:26.900 --> 2:12:30.820]  All right, we've got Jacob Engels, CentralFloridaPost.com,
[2:12:30.820 --> 2:12:33.940]  and Owen Schreuer with us riding the shotgun.
[2:12:33.940 --> 2:12:37.380]  The rest of the hour, the war room comes up at 3 p.m. Central today.
[2:12:37.380 --> 2:12:38.660]  Gentlemen, we have a lot to cover.
[2:12:38.660 --> 2:12:40.580]  It's great to have you here in studio with us, but wow,
[2:12:41.140 --> 2:12:44.580]  is our job not easy other than trying to stay on air with the censor?
[2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:47.300]  I mean, it's all happening. It's all out in the open.
[2:12:47.300 --> 2:12:49.700]  Great to have you both here, each of you about a minute and a half.
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:52.500]  Jacob Engels, what would you call this period of time we're living in right now?
[2:12:54.180 --> 2:12:56.340]  Hell, hell on earth.
[2:12:56.340 --> 2:13:00.260]  I mean, we can't even speak about the most important things,
[2:13:00.260 --> 2:13:03.140]  freedom and liberty and truth.
[2:13:03.140 --> 2:13:04.580]  Truth is forbidden.
[2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:09.460]  Why can we not, as Americans, stand up to our own government,
[2:13:09.460 --> 2:13:13.060]  stand up to the corporations, stand up to the police state?
[2:13:13.060 --> 2:13:16.260]  And this used to be something that left and right agreed upon.
[2:13:16.260 --> 2:13:19.540]  And nowadays, it is a right wing.
[2:13:19.540 --> 2:13:20.820]  They call it fascism.
[2:13:20.820 --> 2:13:22.260]  They call it white nationalism.
[2:13:22.260 --> 2:13:26.020]  If you want to stand up to the man, stand up and fight the power.
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:27.300]  And I just don't understand it.
[2:13:28.100 --> 2:13:29.060]  I agree, Owen Schreuer.
[2:13:29.700 --> 2:13:32.340]  Well, it's the great awakening versus the great reset.
[2:13:32.340 --> 2:13:34.100]  It's all out there. It's in front of us.
[2:13:34.100 --> 2:13:37.140]  Everybody can see it, at least anybody that's paying attention.
[2:13:37.140 --> 2:13:39.860]  Whether they like it or not, their gas prices are going up.
[2:13:39.860 --> 2:13:41.220]  Their energy costs are going up.
[2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:42.580]  Their grocery bills are going up.
[2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:45.700]  So they're in it, whether they want to continue to ignore it
[2:13:45.700 --> 2:13:47.060]  or act like it's not there.
[2:13:47.060 --> 2:13:50.420]  But there's also the great reawakening or great awakening
[2:13:50.420 --> 2:13:51.380]  that's happening right now.
[2:13:51.380 --> 2:13:54.980]  I mean, people tuning in to Band Out Video to watch our shows,
[2:13:54.980 --> 2:13:57.140]  to watch the other content creators that are on there.
[2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:00.980]  There's all kinds of activist groups rising up,
[2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:04.420]  organizations rising up, people hosting political events
[2:14:04.420 --> 2:14:05.940]  that are conservatives or Christians
[2:14:05.940 --> 2:14:10.100]  that wouldn't have been doing so four, five, six years ago,
[2:14:10.100 --> 2:14:10.820]  but now are.
[2:14:10.820 --> 2:14:12.580]  So that's the great reawakening,
[2:14:12.580 --> 2:14:14.580]  but then there's the great reset where we know the plan.
[2:14:15.380 --> 2:14:18.900]  And right now, the biggest lie to understand
[2:14:18.900 --> 2:14:20.580]  is man-made climate change,
[2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:23.940]  and knowing that that's just the excuse to shut off your energy,
[2:14:24.740 --> 2:14:29.860]  make it so you can't drive a combustion vehicle down the road
[2:14:29.860 --> 2:14:32.420]  to do whatever you want on your own time at your own accord.
[2:14:32.980 --> 2:14:34.820]  And that's what people are going to have to accept.
[2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:36.580]  And once they accept it, they can decide,
[2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:39.300]  well, maybe I want to live in poverty the rest of my life
[2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:41.300]  and then become sterile or infertile,
[2:14:41.300 --> 2:14:43.220]  because that's part of the New World Order.
[2:14:43.220 --> 2:14:45.140]  Or I kind of like prosperity.
[2:14:45.140 --> 2:14:46.340]  I kind of like freedom.
[2:14:46.340 --> 2:14:48.980]  I kind of like what America set the standard
[2:14:48.980 --> 2:14:52.980]  for the world like in the 19th and 20th century.
[2:14:52.980 --> 2:14:55.700]  So maybe we should go back to that.
[2:14:55.700 --> 2:14:58.660]  But that's everything that's in front of us right now, I think.
[2:14:58.660 --> 2:14:59.140]  That's right.
[2:14:59.140 --> 2:15:00.980]  And Jacob Engels, you've been persecuted
[2:15:00.980 --> 2:15:02.020]  with the Central Florida Post,
[2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:04.020]  exposing a gubernatorial candidate
[2:15:04.020 --> 2:15:06.820]  and the drug-fueled orgy and the rest of it.
[2:15:06.820 --> 2:15:11.220]  And where do you see this going just in 30 seconds?
[2:15:12.180 --> 2:15:13.940]  Well, I think we're on a collision course,
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:15.700]  a crash course in America.
[2:15:18.900 --> 2:15:19.940]  It's not even two parties.
[2:15:19.940 --> 2:15:22.020]  It's the uniparting like everyone's talking about.
[2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.660]  It's this system of control.
[2:15:25.220 --> 2:15:27.780]  And you can only push humans so far.
[2:15:28.500 --> 2:15:31.380]  You can only push us so far before we react.
[2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:33.940]  And it's our decision on how we react
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:36.180]  and to do it in the right way
[2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:38.820]  and with courage and with liberty and mind.
[2:15:38.820 --> 2:15:40.260]  And we've got to stand up.
[2:15:40.260 --> 2:15:40.660]  That's right.
[2:15:40.660 --> 2:15:42.900]  They want us to have a revolution that's violent and mindless.
[2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:44.900]  No, it's a revolution against the New World Order,
[2:15:44.900 --> 2:15:46.580]  against Bill Gates, against Klaus Schwab,
[2:15:46.580 --> 2:15:47.780]  against the Great Reset,
[2:15:47.780 --> 2:15:48.980]  and against all of their tyranny,
[2:15:48.980 --> 2:15:51.300]  identifying them as the authors of our despair.
[2:15:51.300 --> 2:15:53.060]  We'll be right back with Jacob Engels
[2:15:53.060 --> 2:15:54.900]  and the great Owen Schreuer straight ahead.
[2:15:56.900 --> 2:16:00.740]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide
[2:16:00.740 --> 2:16:03.780]  is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[2:16:03.780 --> 2:16:06.020]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there
[2:16:06.020 --> 2:16:10.020]  that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[2:16:10.660 --> 2:16:11.380]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:16:11.380 --> 2:16:12.980]  we went out and did deep research
[2:16:12.980 --> 2:16:15.460]  on the safest, healthiest ways
[2:16:15.460 --> 2:16:18.900]  to take your overall body's metabolic system
[2:16:19.620 --> 2:16:23.700]  and your metabolism and turn that clock back
[2:16:23.700 --> 2:16:26.180]  by turning up your metabolism.
[2:16:26.740 --> 2:16:27.700]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:16:27.700 --> 2:16:30.180]  Diet Force does it in a clean, healthy way.
[2:16:30.180 --> 2:16:30.820]  It's amazing.
[2:16:30.820 --> 2:16:33.860]  I've almost lost 40 pounds in the last three months
[2:16:33.860 --> 2:16:35.460]  just using the samples of it.
[2:16:35.460 --> 2:16:37.300]  But now it's come into the InfoWars store
[2:16:37.300 --> 2:16:39.700]  and it's ready for sale to you and your family,

[2:16:56.580 --> 2:17:01.140]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.
[2:17:01.140 --> 2:17:04.660]  We are so proud of InfoWarslife immune support.
[2:17:04.660 --> 2:17:07.780]  It is concentrated herbs that are known

[2:17:12.260 --> 2:17:13.060]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[2:17:13.060 --> 2:17:16.500]  this is something that is essential and everyone should get
[2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:18.820]  and on top of it, it funds the InfoWars
[2:17:18.820 --> 2:17:20.260]  so that's a 360 win.
[2:17:20.260 --> 2:17:22.740]  Let me tell you what is in this amazing product.
[2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:26.100]  Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea,
[2:17:26.100 --> 2:17:28.820]  concentrated astragalus root, angelica root,
[2:17:29.380 --> 2:17:31.220]  loatium root and more.
[2:17:31.780 --> 2:17:33.540]  This product is incredible.
[2:17:33.540 --> 2:17:35.380]  InfoWars immune support,
[2:17:35.380 --> 2:17:38.340]  exclusively available at infowarsstore.com,
[2:17:38.340 --> 2:17:41.380]  is funding the tip of the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[2:17:41.380 --> 2:17:42.820]  It is a 360 win.
[2:17:42.820 --> 2:17:45.620]  The only way you fail is by not taking action
[2:17:45.620 --> 2:17:48.500]  and getting this product to boost your body's natural defenses
[2:17:48.500 --> 2:17:49.940]  and keep InfoWars on the air.
[2:17:49.940 --> 2:17:52.260]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[2:17:52.260 --> 2:17:54.580]  Take action now, infowarsstore.com.
[2:17:56.900 --> 2:17:59.940]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas,
[2:17:59.940 --> 2:18:01.940]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor,
[2:18:01.940 --> 2:18:03.300]  a lawyer or a millionaire.
[2:18:03.300 --> 2:18:06.580]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:07.700]  You see it every year.
[2:18:07.700 --> 2:18:10.100]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[2:18:10.100 --> 2:18:12.740]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[2:18:12.740 --> 2:18:15.700]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[2:18:15.700 --> 2:18:18.420]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[2:18:18.420 --> 2:18:19.700]  because they're part of the system
[2:18:19.700 --> 2:18:21.460]  and they don't want the general public
[2:18:21.460 --> 2:18:22.900]  understanding this and knowing this.
[2:18:22.900 --> 2:18:26.260]  So it's a very important situation with inflation
[2:18:26.260 --> 2:18:27.860]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[2:18:28.660 --> 2:18:31.620]  To be able to do things tax-wise,
[2:18:31.620 --> 2:18:34.180]  it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money.
[2:18:34.180 --> 2:18:35.300]  We wouldn't even be here
[2:18:35.300 --> 2:18:38.500]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[2:18:39.620 --> 2:18:43.060]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[2:18:43.060 --> 2:18:44.740]  jonestaxrelief.com.
[2:18:44.740 --> 2:18:50.020]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[2:18:50.020 --> 2:19:00.740]  7 months ago, in December of 2021, we launched the first
[2:19:00.740 --> 2:19:03.220]  in the three-coin founding member series,
[2:19:03.220 --> 2:19:05.780]  George Washington Slaying the Dragon.
[2:19:05.780 --> 2:19:07.780]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin,
[2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:09.540]  and finally, the Second Amendment
[2:19:09.540 --> 2:19:11.700]  comment-ticket Molan Lobby coin.
[2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:17.540]  There are only 75 coins left in the three-coin series,
[2:19:17.540 --> 2:19:22.500]  exclusively, right now, at 1776.coin.com.
[2:19:22.500 --> 2:19:26.020]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[2:19:26.020 --> 2:19:28.260]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[2:19:28.260 --> 2:19:31.860]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made
[2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:35.140]  of the sheepdog chasing the wolf in a personal message.
[2:19:35.140 --> 2:19:41.460]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776.coin.com.
[2:19:41.460 --> 2:19:43.540]  This is history happening now.
[2:19:43.540 --> 2:19:46.500]  Infoworks thanks for your support is changing the world,
[2:19:46.500 --> 2:19:50.260]  and this is the final 75 three-coin set
[2:19:50.260 --> 2:20:16.580]  exclusively available at 1776.coin.com.
[2:20:24.180 --> 2:20:26.580]  Now's the time for that, and it's time to stop being fake,
[2:20:26.580 --> 2:20:30.340]  and admit we all have sinned and aren't perfect.
[2:20:30.340 --> 2:20:35.940]  And a perfect example of this is the corporate media
[2:20:35.940 --> 2:20:38.580]  and everything they're doing and trying to demonize
[2:20:38.580 --> 2:20:41.460]  lesbians in the Netherlands, the Tucker Carlson add-on,
[2:20:41.460 --> 2:20:44.260]  facing five years in prison for saying no,
[2:20:44.260 --> 2:20:45.460]  men or men, women or women.
[2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:48.100]  A man can say he's a woman, but a man is a man,
[2:20:48.100 --> 2:20:48.900]  a woman is a woman.
[2:20:48.900 --> 2:20:51.220]  You know, two women can have a baby in prison,
[2:20:51.220 --> 2:20:52.580]  but look at this latest stuff.
[2:20:52.580 --> 2:20:55.940]  There's a movement among some archaeologists
[2:20:55.940 --> 2:20:58.340]  to stop identifying human remains as male or female
[2:20:58.340 --> 2:21:01.060]  because we don't know how they identify.
[2:21:01.060 --> 2:21:02.260]  That's mind control.
[2:21:02.260 --> 2:21:05.780]  Here's the article out of the college fix dealing with it.
[2:21:05.780 --> 2:21:07.700]  Then there's this, transgender health secretary says
[2:21:07.700 --> 2:21:10.260]  Biden White House will empower children
[2:21:10.260 --> 2:21:12.580]  to get puberty blocker sex changes at age eight.
[2:21:13.620 --> 2:21:15.300]  That is a pervert class.
[2:21:15.300 --> 2:21:17.220]  I don't care if they're heterosexual, homosexual,
[2:21:17.220 --> 2:21:20.500]  who they are, leave the children alone.
[2:21:20.500 --> 2:21:24.740]  Reddit bans anti-LGBTQ groomer slur,
[2:21:24.740 --> 2:21:26.660]  but the left is out grooming children.
[2:21:26.660 --> 2:21:29.620]  I don't care whether it's homosexual or heterosexual.
[2:21:29.620 --> 2:21:31.940]  UPin nominates transgender swimmer,
[2:21:31.940 --> 2:21:34.340]  Liz Thomas for NCAA Woman of the Year.
[2:21:35.220 --> 2:21:38.740]  This is the war on humanity.
[2:21:38.740 --> 2:21:42.340]  And so having our guest here in studio,
[2:21:42.340 --> 2:21:43.540]  Owen Shroyer and Jacob Ingalls.
[2:21:43.540 --> 2:21:45.620]  I've known about Jacob's work for at least five years.
[2:21:45.620 --> 2:21:48.180]  Great work on Central Florida Post breaking hundreds
[2:21:49.140 --> 2:21:50.100]  of major stories.
[2:21:50.100 --> 2:21:53.220]  But he doesn't wear it on an armband that he's gay.
[2:21:53.220 --> 2:21:54.420]  I don't run around and say,
[2:21:54.420 --> 2:21:56.100]  I'm a heterosexual all day long.
[2:21:56.660 --> 2:21:58.740]  And people say, well, a small minority.
[2:21:58.740 --> 2:21:59.940]  Why are you having that guy on?
[2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:01.220]  We don't hate anybody.
[2:22:01.220 --> 2:22:03.140]  Jesus Christ hung out with the,
[2:22:03.140 --> 2:22:04.980]  with the tax collectors and the prostitutes.
[2:22:04.980 --> 2:22:07.460]  And by the way, I'm not perfect.
[2:22:07.460 --> 2:22:09.860]  I'm not saying in my whole life of judging people.
[2:22:09.860 --> 2:22:11.700]  And when adults do, adults do.
[2:22:11.700 --> 2:22:15.060]  The point is what's going after children is the key here.
[2:22:15.060 --> 2:22:19.540]  And now they're banning major movements of whether it's people
[2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:22.500]  that are heterosexual, homosexual, pansexual, whatever it is,
[2:22:22.500 --> 2:22:24.820]  from saying we don't want to be associated
[2:22:24.820 --> 2:22:26.020]  with grooming children.
[2:22:26.020 --> 2:22:27.620]  That's who they're really scared of
[2:22:27.620 --> 2:22:29.300]  because they want to continue that movement on.
[2:22:29.300 --> 2:22:33.860]  So Jacob, what is it like going to these anti abortion
[2:22:33.860 --> 2:22:34.900]  rallies and being attacked?
[2:22:34.900 --> 2:22:36.980]  And the pro abortion rallies are being attacked.
[2:22:36.980 --> 2:22:39.380]  And then you never play that card on these people.
[2:22:40.100 --> 2:22:42.420]  But, but, but, but, but now they're trying to connect
[2:22:42.420 --> 2:22:45.540]  to anybody who has a different lifestyle
[2:22:45.540 --> 2:22:47.140]  to their pedophilic lifestyle.
[2:22:47.140 --> 2:22:47.940]  What is that like?
[2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:50.980]  And can you speak to this major anti groomer movement
[2:22:50.980 --> 2:22:55.220]  that's, that's particularly being headed up by gays
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:22:56.980]  and lesbians that don't want to be associated
[2:22:56.980 --> 2:22:58.740]  with kidnapping and raping children?
[2:22:59.220 --> 2:23:01.860]  Yeah, I mean, Alex, when I go to these rallies,
[2:23:01.860 --> 2:23:04.500]  when I go to the abortion parties like Owen and I talked
[2:23:04.500 --> 2:23:06.900]  about yesterday on the show, I don't,
[2:23:06.900 --> 2:23:08.020]  I don't pull the gay card.
[2:23:08.020 --> 2:23:10.820]  I don't, I don't try and talk about, oh, I'm gay.
[2:23:10.820 --> 2:23:11.540]  Oh, I'm gay.
[2:23:11.540 --> 2:23:12.180]  Oh, I'm gay.
[2:23:12.180 --> 2:23:15.140]  I really let them kind of bully and push and pester me
[2:23:15.140 --> 2:23:17.460]  to the point where I eventually say, you know what,
[2:23:17.460 --> 2:23:18.820]  that's very homophobic.
[2:23:18.820 --> 2:23:19.860]  How dare you?
[2:23:19.860 --> 2:23:21.700]  How dare you question me?
[2:23:21.700 --> 2:23:22.500]  I'm gay.
[2:23:22.500 --> 2:23:23.380]  You can't question me.
[2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:24.180]  These are your rules.
[2:23:24.180 --> 2:23:25.380]  These aren't my rules.
[2:23:25.380 --> 2:23:27.620]  And then they get extremely nasty.
[2:23:27.620 --> 2:23:30.020]  They say, oh, we hope you get AIDS.
[2:23:30.020 --> 2:23:31.620]  We hope you get monkeypox.
[2:23:31.620 --> 2:23:33.220]  We hope you die.
[2:23:33.220 --> 2:23:34.900]  And I'm like, well, wait a second,
[2:23:34.900 --> 2:23:39.220]  I'm part of the LGBTQIA plus space alien community.
[2:23:39.220 --> 2:23:42.260]  But now it's not enough to be gay.
[2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:44.260]  You've got to go out and groom.
[2:23:44.260 --> 2:23:46.260]  You've got to share the porn in the schools.
[2:23:46.260 --> 2:23:48.260]  You've got to read the porn to your children.
[2:23:48.260 --> 2:23:52.260]  That's the current state of the LGBT community.
[2:23:52.260 --> 2:23:53.300]  And it really is sick.
[2:23:53.300 --> 2:23:54.660]  Hey, I want to do whatever I want.
[2:23:54.660 --> 2:23:55.460]  Leave me alone.
[2:23:55.460 --> 2:23:56.500]  It's my own personal life.
[2:23:56.500 --> 2:23:57.620]  I'm not going to affect you.
[2:23:57.620 --> 2:24:02.020]  But now is the time for people in the LGBT community
[2:24:02.020 --> 2:24:04.580]  to stand up and say, we're not going to groom children.
[2:24:04.580 --> 2:24:05.620]  This is sick stuff.
[2:24:05.620 --> 2:24:10.580]  The polls show that the majority of folks
[2:24:10.580 --> 2:24:12.740]  that have alternative lifestyles do not support this.
[2:24:13.300 --> 2:24:14.420]  No, no.
[2:24:14.420 --> 2:24:16.900]  And that's just a simple fact.
[2:24:16.900 --> 2:24:18.260]  What you do see, Alex, though,
[2:24:18.260 --> 2:24:22.500]  we have an individual, a group of individuals in Florida
[2:24:22.500 --> 2:24:27.700]  who are straight parents who have children.
[2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:30.260]  And they're coming to these school board meetings.
[2:24:30.260 --> 2:24:32.980]  When I exposed genderqueer and I read it aloud,
[2:24:32.980 --> 2:24:34.180]  they're going on Facebook.
[2:24:34.180 --> 2:24:35.780]  One of them is- I should have pointed out,
[2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:38.900]  you've been particularly powerful in national news,
[2:24:38.900 --> 2:24:42.660]  local news, at the school boards exposing this grooming of children.
[2:24:42.660 --> 2:24:43.220]  Yes.
[2:24:43.220 --> 2:24:43.540]  Yes.
[2:24:43.540 --> 2:24:46.100]  And when I exposed that, the comments people send me,
[2:24:46.100 --> 2:24:48.820]  because I'm not allowed on Facebook anymore or on Twitter,
[2:24:48.820 --> 2:24:52.020]  the comments people send me from some of these individuals,
[2:24:52.020 --> 2:24:54.580]  I read it to my six-year-old child.
[2:24:54.580 --> 2:24:56.420]  I read it to them every night.
[2:24:56.420 --> 2:24:58.820]  I love to read genderqueer.
[2:24:58.820 --> 2:25:00.180]  What kind of sick person?
[2:25:00.180 --> 2:25:00.900]  It's pedophilic.
[2:25:01.460 --> 2:25:01.940]  Yes.
[2:25:01.940 --> 2:25:02.900]  It's a sick cult.
[2:25:02.900 --> 2:25:05.220]  And what do we do?
[2:25:05.220 --> 2:25:06.500]  What do we do as humans?
[2:25:06.500 --> 2:25:07.380]  What do we do?
[2:25:07.380 --> 2:25:08.580]  It's totally satanic.
[2:25:08.580 --> 2:25:09.780]  I want your view on this.
[2:25:09.780 --> 2:25:10.980]  Well, there is a group now.
[2:25:10.980 --> 2:25:12.740]  It's called Gays Against Groomers.
[2:25:12.740 --> 2:25:14.340]  And they are having events.
[2:25:14.340 --> 2:25:17.460]  I think they got an event coming up later this month in July
[2:25:17.460 --> 2:25:18.580]  that I was talking about.
[2:25:18.580 --> 2:25:22.420]  So, yeah, most people that identify as gay or whatever,
[2:25:22.420 --> 2:25:24.660]  they don't want to be identified or in a group
[2:25:24.660 --> 2:25:26.660]  with these radical leftists.
[2:25:26.660 --> 2:25:28.340]  And Jacob, you know what you said earlier.
[2:25:28.900 --> 2:25:31.780]  It's like it's not even about whether you're gay or not now.
[2:25:31.780 --> 2:25:32.900]  I don't think it ever was.
[2:25:32.900 --> 2:25:33.620]  It's about pedophilia.
[2:25:33.620 --> 2:25:36.580]  It was always about far left-wing agendas,
[2:25:36.580 --> 2:25:38.100]  Democrat party agendas,
[2:25:38.100 --> 2:25:40.020]  and then, ultimately, the bottom of the barrel
[2:25:40.020 --> 2:25:40.900]  when it comes to their sex.
[2:25:40.900 --> 2:25:44.420]  And then forming a sexual relationship with your child.
[2:25:45.620 --> 2:25:47.540]  Which is what they want to do in the classrooms.
[2:25:47.540 --> 2:25:50.980]  Now, they tested this back with Bill Clinton with Jocelyn Elders
[2:25:50.980 --> 2:25:53.300]  when she went in front of Congress and she said,
[2:25:53.300 --> 2:25:55.380]  we need to reach our hands down your child's pants
[2:25:55.380 --> 2:25:56.340]  and teach them how to masturbate.
[2:25:56.340 --> 2:25:56.820]  That was like, no.
[2:25:56.820 --> 2:25:59.300]  We need to reach down the baby's pants
[2:25:59.300 --> 2:26:01.620]  and touch them and show them how.
[2:26:01.620 --> 2:26:03.220]  Wow, is that Jocelyn Elders' back?
[2:26:03.860 --> 2:26:05.380]  All the way back time traveling?
[2:26:05.380 --> 2:26:07.220]  So yeah, but that was a little shocking back then.
[2:26:07.220 --> 2:26:10.100]  And people weren't really watching C-Span as much as they are now.
[2:26:11.300 --> 2:26:12.980]  So it was kind of just floating out there.
[2:26:12.980 --> 2:26:14.020]  It's a long-term agenda.
[2:26:14.020 --> 2:26:15.220]  It was kind of just floated out there.
[2:26:15.220 --> 2:26:16.740]  It's like, hey, let's see what Jocelyn Elders,
[2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:17.940]  let's see her say in front of Congress,
[2:26:17.940 --> 2:26:19.780]  see how much, see what kind of takes on that.
[2:26:19.780 --> 2:26:22.260]  And yeah, the people that did hear it,
[2:26:22.260 --> 2:26:24.580]  obviously said, look at how crazy this is.
[2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:25.700]  In fact, I remember at the time,
[2:26:25.700 --> 2:26:27.460]  Rush Limbaugh was probably the major...
[2:26:28.100 --> 2:26:29.300]  He played the clip over and over again.
[2:26:29.300 --> 2:26:30.980]  Yeah, he was probably the major one to expose that.
[2:26:30.980 --> 2:26:33.220]  Which by the way, they censored so good, you can't find it.
[2:26:33.220 --> 2:26:37.220]  I heard that clip 500 times in like 1993, 94.
[2:26:37.220 --> 2:26:38.340]  You cannot find it.
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:39.780]  Yeah, well, that's just...
[2:26:39.780 --> 2:26:42.020]  I mean, that's the new nature of the internet
[2:26:42.020 --> 2:26:43.220]  trying to find things like that.
[2:26:43.220 --> 2:26:44.100]  You just can't, whether it's...
[2:26:44.100 --> 2:26:45.060]  We were talking about in the break,
[2:26:45.060 --> 2:26:47.700]  like old Alex Jones videos, old promo videos
[2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:48.820]  you used to do that were viral.
[2:26:48.820 --> 2:26:50.420]  You can't even find them anywhere.
[2:26:50.420 --> 2:26:53.700]  But I, you know, the farther left it goes with this,
[2:26:54.820 --> 2:26:56.500]  it's just people that are in the center
[2:26:56.500 --> 2:26:58.100]  are going to be called right wing.
[2:26:58.100 --> 2:26:59.220]  They know they're not right wing.
[2:26:59.220 --> 2:27:00.740]  They're probably maybe even liberals,
[2:27:00.740 --> 2:27:02.340]  but they're like, I have common sense.
[2:27:02.340 --> 2:27:03.300]  A man is a man.
[2:27:03.300 --> 2:27:06.340]  Even Bill Maher says, stop grooming children.
[2:27:06.340 --> 2:27:06.740]  Yeah.
[2:27:06.740 --> 2:27:07.780]  I mean, that's what it is.
[2:27:08.340 --> 2:27:10.020]  Well, Bill Maher, I mean,
[2:27:10.020 --> 2:27:12.340]  he's always been consistent on these issues.
[2:27:12.340 --> 2:27:16.900]  He's a Kennedy era, free speech, anti-war Democrat.
[2:27:16.900 --> 2:27:19.300]  And now to see all these liberals come after him
[2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:22.260]  and say, Bill Maher, he's a crypto fascist.
[2:27:22.260 --> 2:27:23.780]  This is the biggest joke.
[2:27:23.780 --> 2:27:25.220]  He supports our free speech.
[2:27:25.220 --> 2:27:25.940]  Yes.
[2:27:25.940 --> 2:27:28.180]  Well, look, when they want to ban that term groomer,
[2:27:28.180 --> 2:27:30.020]  you know that's because it's accurate.
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:32.180]  You know, that's why they want to ban it.
[2:27:32.180 --> 2:27:33.380]  Well, they know it's accurate.
[2:27:33.380 --> 2:27:35.220]  What did some, I was reading some of the comments
[2:27:35.220 --> 2:27:40.500]  on this on, on Twitter and looking and seeing that,
[2:27:40.500 --> 2:27:42.260]  what about all the grooming groups,
[2:27:42.260 --> 2:27:45.060]  like dog groomers and everything else on Reddit?
[2:27:45.700 --> 2:27:46.180]  They're gone.
[2:27:46.180 --> 2:27:47.140]  I can't even say grammar now.
[2:27:47.140 --> 2:27:48.020]  Yeah, you can't, you can't promote your dog.
[2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:49.540]  They're just banning every word there is.
[2:27:50.340 --> 2:27:51.460]  Well, that's what they have to do.
[2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:53.300]  When you start rewriting language,
[2:27:53.300 --> 2:27:54.420]  I really don't understand.
[2:27:54.420 --> 2:27:55.380]  What are you going to do?
[2:27:55.380 --> 2:27:57.380]  I guess you're probably first, second,
[2:27:57.380 --> 2:27:58.660]  maybe some third grade.
[2:27:58.660 --> 2:28:00.340]  You're going through English grammar.
[2:28:00.340 --> 2:28:01.700]  You, you learn grammar.
[2:28:01.700 --> 2:28:04.100]  You learn about words and meanings.
[2:28:04.100 --> 2:28:06.340]  I mean, think about languages like Spanish,
[2:28:06.340 --> 2:28:07.380]  Italian, Portuguese.
[2:28:07.380 --> 2:28:08.900]  I mean, these are languages that,
[2:28:08.900 --> 2:28:11.380]  that are based off of gender in many ways.
[2:28:11.380 --> 2:28:15.140]  So when do we go back and just rewrite the language books
[2:28:15.140 --> 2:28:16.340]  and the, and the English books?
[2:28:16.340 --> 2:28:17.780]  Because well, that's the new thing they're telling
[2:28:17.780 --> 2:28:20.820]  police departments and the FBI crime lab
[2:28:20.820 --> 2:28:23.140]  and archaeology professors.
[2:28:23.140 --> 2:28:25.060]  You can't say a skeleton's male or female.
[2:28:25.060 --> 2:28:26.260]  So that's, I mean, that's a cult.
[2:28:26.260 --> 2:28:27.140]  So, so that's what I'm saying.
[2:28:27.140 --> 2:28:29.300]  So when, when is it I open?
[2:28:30.500 --> 2:28:33.220]  Let's say you open your kid's first grade English book.
[2:28:33.220 --> 2:28:36.100]  I still remember they had the, they had the graphs
[2:28:36.100 --> 2:28:37.780]  and it's like, here's how you use they.
[2:28:37.780 --> 2:28:39.940]  And then here's the words how that follow they
[2:28:39.940 --> 2:28:41.380]  and them and the segregation.
[2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:43.380]  And then here's, here's the chromosomes.
[2:28:43.380 --> 2:28:44.820]  Yeah. Is that gone now?
[2:28:44.820 --> 2:28:45.780]  What are they going to put in the next book?
[2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:46.260]  No, they've removed it.
[2:28:46.260 --> 2:28:48.180]  They actually say there's no chromosomes now.
[2:28:48.180 --> 2:28:49.300]  How do you even learn English?
[2:28:49.300 --> 2:28:51.060]  And there's no FDA approval for drugs.
[2:28:51.060 --> 2:28:53.700]  It's all just total anti-science garbage.
[2:28:53.700 --> 2:28:54.260]  We'll be right back.
[2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:55.140]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:24.260 --> 2:29:44.900]  It is simply amazing.
[2:29:56.980 --> 2:29:58.900]  There is nothing, there is no more
[2:29:59.460 --> 2:30:02.420]  epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:30:03.380 --> 2:30:06.420]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[2:30:07.220 --> 2:30:09.700]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place
[2:30:09.700 --> 2:30:10.740]  for information.
[2:30:10.740 --> 2:30:12.420]  You might not agree with everything.
[2:30:12.420 --> 2:30:14.020]  You might not agree with all our perspectives,
[2:30:14.020 --> 2:30:15.620]  but we cover all the information.
[2:30:16.260 --> 2:30:18.100]  And there's nowhere else really that does it
[2:30:18.100 --> 2:30:18.740]  like we do here.
[2:30:18.740 --> 2:30:19.860]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:30:19.860 --> 2:30:22.100]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way,
[2:30:22.100 --> 2:30:24.260]  the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com,
[2:30:24.260 --> 2:30:25.140]  is where to get them, folks.
[2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:26.740]  And we do have the best supplements.
[2:30:26.740 --> 2:30:28.580]  I mean, just like we try our best
[2:30:29.300 --> 2:30:31.060]  with our news coverage and our information,
[2:30:32.100 --> 2:30:35.220]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:30:35.860 --> 2:30:37.940]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[2:30:37.940 --> 2:30:39.460]  Folks, this is a joke.
[2:30:39.460 --> 2:30:40.820]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[2:30:40.820 --> 2:30:42.340]  It's 75% off.
[2:30:42.340 --> 2:30:44.900]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed.
[2:30:44.900 --> 2:30:48.820]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:51.060]  Quite well, I might add.
[2:30:51.060 --> 2:30:53.700]  Quite well, my barber appreciates
[2:30:53.700 --> 2:30:55.060]  hair and beard support for men.
[2:30:55.060 --> 2:30:56.900]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:30:56.900 --> 2:31:00.820]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide
[2:31:00.820 --> 2:31:03.860]  is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[2:31:03.860 --> 2:31:06.580]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work,
[2:31:07.140 --> 2:31:10.100]  but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[2:31:10.660 --> 2:31:12.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research
[2:31:12.980 --> 2:31:15.460]  on the safest, healthiest ways
[2:31:15.460 --> 2:31:18.980]  to take your overall body's metabolic system
[2:31:18.980 --> 2:31:23.220]  and your metabolism and turn that clock back
[2:31:23.220 --> 2:31:26.100]  by turning up your metabolism.
[2:31:26.100 --> 2:31:28.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, Diet Force does it
[2:31:28.100 --> 2:31:29.620]  in a clean, healthy way.
[2:31:29.620 --> 2:31:30.260]  It's amazing.
[2:31:30.260 --> 2:31:33.300]  I've almost lost 40 pounds the last three months
[2:31:33.300 --> 2:31:34.900]  just using the samples of it,
[2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.900]  but now it's come into the InfoWare Store
[2:31:36.900 --> 2:31:39.140]  and it's ready for sale to you and your family,

[2:32:00.260 --> 2:32:01.460]  and with word of mouth and prayer.
[2:32:02.260 --> 2:32:04.020]  All the success that we've had together
[2:32:04.020 --> 2:32:05.220]  against the globalists and the fact
[2:32:05.220 --> 2:32:07.220]  that we're not caught flat-footed
[2:32:07.220 --> 2:32:09.860]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[2:32:09.860 --> 2:32:12.180]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[2:32:44.740 --> 2:32:46.900]  and be part of the global awakening,
[2:32:46.900 --> 2:32:49.540]  the new renaissance that's countering the great reset
[2:32:49.540 --> 2:32:51.780]  by going to infowarstore.com
[2:32:51.780 --> 2:32:54.180]  and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[2:32:54.180 --> 2:32:55.460]  Thank you so much for your support.
[2:32:55.460 --> 2:33:17.460]  Please take action.
[2:33:31.700 --> 2:33:34.340]  So the social engineers, the behavioral psychologists,
[2:33:34.340 --> 2:33:35.540]  the globalist controllers,
[2:33:36.740 --> 2:33:38.420]  they have a real paradox to deal with.
[2:33:39.460 --> 2:33:40.980]  They're saying we're cutting your power off
[2:33:40.980 --> 2:33:42.980]  to make you transition, but there is no transition.
[2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.060]  But the Russians did it.
[2:33:45.780 --> 2:33:47.380]  And hey, there's no pedophiles anywhere,
[2:33:47.380 --> 2:33:49.060]  but we want access sexually to your children
[2:33:49.060 --> 2:33:50.500]  and they're all getting busted via pedophiles.
[2:33:51.540 --> 2:33:52.980]  And the list just goes on and on.
[2:33:52.980 --> 2:33:55.540]  They're a wrecking society destroying things.
[2:33:55.540 --> 2:33:57.060]  It's obviously an evil spirit.
[2:33:58.740 --> 2:34:01.060]  But Owen Schroyer, how did it get organized
[2:34:01.060 --> 2:34:01.940]  and how do we stop it?
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:03.380]  And what do you expect them to do next?
[2:34:05.140 --> 2:34:07.300]  Well, I mean, there's a lot to unpack there.
[2:34:07.300 --> 2:34:10.740]  I think when we just neutrally observe
[2:34:10.740 --> 2:34:12.500]  this Biden administration,
[2:34:12.500 --> 2:34:14.660]  you've never seen a bigger cast of clowns
[2:34:14.660 --> 2:34:16.740]  and freaks and geeks ever.
[2:34:16.740 --> 2:34:18.740]  And I want to be clear, I don't really care.
[2:34:18.740 --> 2:34:20.180]  Honestly, I get along with everybody.
[2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:22.740]  I've been around different types of clubs
[2:34:22.740 --> 2:34:24.020]  and bars. I've seen it all.
[2:34:24.020 --> 2:34:26.100]  But it's men in dresses with shaved heads
[2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:29.220]  and men dresses women in admiral outfits.
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:30.500]  I mean, it's clown world.
[2:34:30.500 --> 2:34:33.140]  Yeah, I mean, you're not sending these people
[2:34:33.140 --> 2:34:34.900]  to foreign diplomatic meetings.
[2:34:34.900 --> 2:34:36.020]  You're not sending these people
[2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:37.620]  to be representatives of your country.
[2:34:37.620 --> 2:34:39.300]  And that's fine.
[2:34:39.300 --> 2:34:41.460]  This is what you do if you want to discredit your country.
[2:34:41.460 --> 2:34:44.740]  Yes. So when we're sending men dressed as women
[2:34:44.740 --> 2:34:48.180]  to France last week for foreign diplomatic meetings,
[2:34:48.180 --> 2:34:50.580]  and it's literally a dude in drag with a bald head
[2:34:50.580 --> 2:34:53.620]  and big red lipstick on and high heels in a dress,
[2:34:53.620 --> 2:34:56.820]  and then it's Rachel Levine, Mr. Potato Head.
[2:34:56.820 --> 2:34:59.300]  Yeah, guys, show the head of the atomic energy,
[2:34:59.300 --> 2:35:02.180]  the nuclear waste with Rachel Levine.
[2:35:02.180 --> 2:35:03.380]  I mean, the photos of them,
[2:35:04.980 --> 2:35:06.740]  and then they're talking about,
[2:35:06.740 --> 2:35:08.420]  we want access to your children.
[2:35:08.420 --> 2:35:10.180]  So when does it get to the point
[2:35:10.180 --> 2:35:12.340]  where people just look at a photo
[2:35:12.340 --> 2:35:15.220]  of the Biden administration or whoever it is next?
[2:35:15.220 --> 2:35:16.740]  And it's just, it's a clown show.
[2:35:16.740 --> 2:35:18.260]  I mean, it's literally like, oh, is this the circus?
[2:35:18.260 --> 2:35:19.140]  Is the circus in town?
[2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:20.740]  The Ringling Brothers coming around here?
[2:35:20.740 --> 2:35:21.380]  What do we have here?
[2:35:21.380 --> 2:35:24.020]  Oh, no, that's the, that's the U.S. foreign delegation.
[2:35:24.020 --> 2:35:24.900]  They're not just clowns.
[2:35:24.900 --> 2:35:26.820]  They want access to your children.
[2:35:26.820 --> 2:35:30.580]  So yeah, and there was also another Biden appointee
[2:35:30.580 --> 2:35:32.740]  at the U.S. Postal Service that just got busted
[2:35:32.740 --> 2:35:34.420]  as a pedophile in a sting operation.
[2:35:34.420 --> 2:35:35.780]  He was on video admitting all of it.
[2:35:35.780 --> 2:35:39.220]  So, you know, but even Gillum, I mean, look at Gillum,
[2:35:39.220 --> 2:35:40.340]  he's got like, under Biden.
[2:35:40.340 --> 2:35:41.300]  Look at these people.
[2:35:41.300 --> 2:35:42.340]  What the hell?
[2:35:42.980 --> 2:35:44.580]  I'm in charge of nuclear waste.
[2:35:44.580 --> 2:35:46.260]  I'm in charge of your children.
[2:35:46.260 --> 2:35:47.860]  I want to talk to your children.
[2:35:47.860 --> 2:35:49.620]  I'm a man in an admiral outfit.
[2:35:50.180 --> 2:35:51.620]  They're not sending their best.
[2:35:51.620 --> 2:35:52.660]  They're not sending their best.
[2:35:52.660 --> 2:35:54.740]  I think Gillum is kind of like Hunter Biden though.
[2:35:54.740 --> 2:35:55.460]  I mean, that was almost.
[2:35:55.460 --> 2:35:56.980]  I like how he leaves the hair on the legs.
[2:35:56.980 --> 2:35:59.940]  That's always a, plus they say they're women
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:02.020]  and they look as hideous as possible.
[2:36:02.020 --> 2:36:03.940]  Like Blair White looks like a woman,
[2:36:03.940 --> 2:36:05.060]  doesn't want to go after kids.
[2:36:05.060 --> 2:36:06.420]  Great, you're a free person.
[2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:09.140]  Well, why don't they give people like Blair White?
[2:36:09.140 --> 2:36:10.180]  Because they won't work for him.
[2:36:10.180 --> 2:36:14.580]  Why is it ugly men that look like total space aliens
[2:36:14.580 --> 2:36:16.020]  that want access to our children?
[2:36:16.020 --> 2:36:19.780]  There's a mental illness that runs deep here, Alex.
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:21.140]  It runs deep is what it is.
[2:36:21.140 --> 2:36:22.260]  But why is it on top?
[2:36:22.260 --> 2:36:23.780]  Why is it demanding we follow it?
[2:36:23.780 --> 2:36:26.820]  I think they're just so out and out about it.
[2:36:26.820 --> 2:36:28.100]  They're throwing it in our face.
[2:36:28.100 --> 2:36:29.540]  It's almost like they're taunting us,
[2:36:29.540 --> 2:36:31.860]  like the bully in school.
[2:36:31.860 --> 2:36:34.660]  They're pushing you to react.
[2:36:34.660 --> 2:36:38.660]  Yeah, flicking you in the ear, giving you the wet Willy.
[2:36:40.660 --> 2:36:42.900]  I mean, he had the clip yesterday and didn't play it.
[2:36:42.900 --> 2:36:47.140]  Can we get the Undersecretary of Health clip ready
[2:36:47.140 --> 2:36:49.460]  where he's talking about we need to help your children
[2:36:49.460 --> 2:36:50.500]  cut their testicles off?
[2:36:51.700 --> 2:36:52.820]  Yeah, you want to empower.
[2:36:53.540 --> 2:36:57.220]  We want to empower transgender youth, I believe,
[2:36:57.220 --> 2:36:58.180]  was the quote.
[2:36:58.180 --> 2:37:00.580]  Dr. Weenichop, I think people are calling.
[2:37:00.580 --> 2:37:02.900]  Oh, you know, they banned Marjorie Taylor-Green
[2:37:02.900 --> 2:37:04.660]  from Twitter because she said Weenichop.
[2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:06.180]  Really?
[2:37:06.180 --> 2:37:08.420]  Yeah, well, if I went to the doctor,
[2:37:08.420 --> 2:37:10.660]  like I joked around last week and I said,
[2:37:10.660 --> 2:37:12.180]  when I say I'm going to cut my finger off
[2:37:12.180 --> 2:37:13.380]  the audience to show my commitment,
[2:37:13.380 --> 2:37:16.100]  hypothetically, I said, I'm not going to really do it.
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:17.860]  I said that clearly in the same sentence.
[2:37:17.860 --> 2:37:18.900]  I said, that'll be horrible.
[2:37:18.900 --> 2:37:20.420]  They'll say I'm going to say I'm going to be arrested.
[2:37:20.420 --> 2:37:22.820]  But if we want to chop your eight-year-old son's genitals off,
[2:37:22.820 --> 2:37:23.460]  it's good.
[2:37:23.460 --> 2:37:25.860]  And they edited that out and said, he's crazy.
[2:37:25.860 --> 2:37:26.900]  He wants to cut his finger off.
[2:37:27.460 --> 2:37:30.580]  But what if I actually have people that are like,
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:31.700]  identify as ambulatory?
[2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:32.900]  They cut their arms and legs off, actually.
[2:37:32.900 --> 2:37:33.460]  That's a big thing.
[2:37:34.740 --> 2:37:35.700]  It's mental illness.
[2:37:36.740 --> 2:37:40.260]  But when it's liberal and when it's liberal and LGBTQIA plus,
[2:37:40.260 --> 2:37:41.460]  it's empowering.
[2:37:41.460 --> 2:37:41.860]  Yeah.
[2:37:41.860 --> 2:37:42.820]  You have to accept it.
[2:37:42.820 --> 2:37:43.860]  You have to worship it.
[2:37:43.860 --> 2:37:44.340]  Yeah.
[2:37:44.340 --> 2:37:45.540]  So I forget this guy's name.
[2:37:45.540 --> 2:37:47.460]  Well, what's the Rachel Levine?
[2:37:47.460 --> 2:37:48.180]  Rachel Levine.
[2:37:48.180 --> 2:37:52.020]  All right, so here is a dude in an admiral outfit
[2:37:52.020 --> 2:37:55.540]  who says, I am an admiral and saying,
[2:37:55.540 --> 2:37:56.660]  I want to access your children.
[2:37:56.660 --> 2:37:57.060]  Here it is.
[2:37:57.060 --> 2:38:02.900]  We really want to debase our treatment and to affirm
[2:38:02.900 --> 2:38:06.180]  and to support and empower these youths,
[2:38:06.180 --> 2:38:09.460]  not to limit their participation in activities and sports
[2:38:09.460 --> 2:38:13.700]  and even limit their ability to get gender affirmation
[2:38:13.700 --> 2:38:14.660]  treatment in their state.
[2:38:15.940 --> 2:38:17.780]  I love how they play the word games too.
[2:38:17.780 --> 2:38:19.300]  Gender affirmation.
[2:38:19.300 --> 2:38:21.300]  You want a little gender affirmation?
[2:38:21.300 --> 2:38:22.740]  Look down your pants.
[2:38:22.740 --> 2:38:24.100]  What do you call this new thing?
[2:38:24.100 --> 2:38:25.140]  I see it everywhere.
[2:38:25.140 --> 2:38:26.500]  Where they say it's a dude,
[2:38:26.500 --> 2:38:28.500]  but they dress like a clown or a bald head.
[2:38:28.500 --> 2:38:29.460]  Like, I'm a woman.
[2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:31.540]  I look like a space alien.
[2:38:31.540 --> 2:38:32.020]  I don't know.
[2:38:32.020 --> 2:38:32.900]  You look like a Roswell.
[2:38:32.900 --> 2:38:38.180]  I don't know what the old nuclear dildo identifies as.
[2:38:38.180 --> 2:38:40.660]  That might not be a man or a woman.
[2:38:40.660 --> 2:38:42.020]  I think that's a puppy kink.
[2:38:42.020 --> 2:38:43.140]  No, it is the puppies.
[2:38:43.140 --> 2:38:46.500]  I think that's why Shaves is probably better to get the dog.
[2:38:46.500 --> 2:38:47.860]  You were a dog at once, Alex.
[2:38:48.580 --> 2:38:49.220]  Remember that?
[2:38:49.220 --> 2:38:49.700]  Sure.
[2:38:49.700 --> 2:38:51.540]  But I said I was trans-heological.
[2:38:51.540 --> 2:38:54.260]  You were actually the original trans-heal.
[2:38:54.900 --> 2:38:57.220]  You might have inspired Sam Brinton.
[2:38:57.220 --> 2:38:58.180]  Have you ever thought of that?
[2:38:58.820 --> 2:39:01.380]  Hey guys, which clip is it of the girl that says she's a cat?
[2:39:01.380 --> 2:39:03.060]  This is a huge phenomenon.
[2:39:03.060 --> 2:39:07.460]  They confirm public schools are putting cat boxes
[2:39:07.460 --> 2:39:10.420]  in the bathroom so the kids can crap in a cat box.
[2:39:10.420 --> 2:39:11.700]  I mean, you talk about a cult.
[2:39:11.700 --> 2:39:14.500]  I mean, I know they were putting feminine products
[2:39:14.500 --> 2:39:15.460]  in the men's room now.
[2:39:15.460 --> 2:39:17.220]  They're putting kitty litter boxes in there?
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:17.460]  Yeah.
[2:39:18.260 --> 2:39:18.580]  Stop.
[2:39:18.580 --> 2:39:19.300]  I'm not joking.
[2:39:19.940 --> 2:39:20.420]  Stop.
[2:39:20.420 --> 2:39:22.180]  But that was in Michigan, I think.
[2:39:22.180 --> 2:39:22.740]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2:39:22.740 --> 2:39:23.140]  Let's go.
[2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:23.780]  It's Michigan.
[2:39:23.780 --> 2:39:24.900]  Let's play this one a check.
[2:39:24.900 --> 2:39:25.380]  Here she is.
[2:39:25.940 --> 2:39:28.580]  I'm teaching you guys some ways that my friends and I,
[2:39:28.580 --> 2:39:30.260]  meow to one another to communicate
[2:39:30.260 --> 2:39:32.020]  when words just seem a little too difficult.
[2:39:32.580 --> 2:39:33.780]  So, here we go.
[2:39:34.660 --> 2:39:36.500]  Okay, so first off, we have the normal meow
[2:39:36.500 --> 2:39:38.900]  that we just use mostly to get each other's attention.
[2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:40.180]  Meow.
[2:39:41.380 --> 2:39:43.620]  Okay, then we have the dissatisfied meow.
[2:39:48.500 --> 2:39:51.620]  Then the angry meow, but we only use this one on rare occasions
[2:39:51.620 --> 2:39:53.860]  because overall we're a very happy kitten family.
[2:39:54.820 --> 2:39:55.940]  Meow.
[2:39:57.300 --> 2:39:59.620]  Then the happy or content meow.
[2:40:00.980 --> 2:40:01.620]  Meow.
[2:40:03.300 --> 2:40:06.020]  Okay, then one of the most important ones for our kitten family
[2:40:06.020 --> 2:40:07.700]  is that I want to go potty meow.
[2:40:08.580 --> 2:40:10.740]  It took me a really long time to master this meow
[2:40:10.740 --> 2:40:13.860]  because it needs to be really specific
[2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:16.180]  in order for my kittens to understand.
[2:40:17.460 --> 2:40:20.100]  Meow, meow, meow.
[2:40:20.740 --> 2:40:23.060]  Okay, this is the most important meow for me
[2:40:23.060 --> 2:40:26.260]  and it's the I need help wiping meow.
[2:40:27.300 --> 2:40:28.260]  You need help, all right?
[2:40:30.820 --> 2:40:31.860]  You're wiping what?
[2:40:31.860 --> 2:40:32.740]  But definitely not.
[2:40:32.740 --> 2:40:34.740]  That's all pervert, scatological stuff, man.
[2:40:34.740 --> 2:40:37.060]  In-seat meow, and we use this one.
[2:40:37.060 --> 2:40:40.340]  We need a little bit more special kitten attention
[2:40:40.340 --> 2:40:41.060]  if you know what I mean.
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:44.020]  Meow.
[2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:45.780]  Yeah, I don't want to give you any meow attention.
[2:40:47.620 --> 2:40:48.420]  Wow.
[2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:49.860]  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
[2:40:49.860 --> 2:40:51.460]  That one was going to turn me something out.
[2:40:51.460 --> 2:40:53.620]  I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[2:40:53.620 --> 2:40:55.460]  Well, I love how there were rules though.
[2:40:55.460 --> 2:40:56.740]  You know, she laid it out.
[2:40:56.740 --> 2:41:00.180]  She gave us, you know, she had some conditions.
[2:41:00.180 --> 2:41:01.780]  She thought this all through.
[2:41:02.340 --> 2:41:04.580]  I mean, she was mastering the meow.
[2:41:04.580 --> 2:41:06.660]  And they're not on any drugs.
[2:41:06.660 --> 2:41:07.700]  No, no, no, no.
[2:41:07.700 --> 2:41:09.540]  That's a totally sober individual.
[2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:12.580]  Very soon, there'll be entire college courses
[2:41:12.580 --> 2:41:13.460]  dedicated to this.
[2:41:13.460 --> 2:41:13.940]  I hope you know.
[2:41:13.940 --> 2:41:14.740]  Oh, there already is.
[2:41:14.740 --> 2:41:15.460]  You've done it.
[2:41:15.460 --> 2:41:16.820]  Can she speak to cats though?
[2:41:16.820 --> 2:41:19.460]  Is it a, I mean, is it a universal meow?
[2:41:20.740 --> 2:41:22.180]  Or are there, are there, you know...
[2:41:22.180 --> 2:41:23.700]  Are there different language barriers?
[2:41:23.700 --> 2:41:25.540]  Do tatties, meow different?
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:26.340]  Are there accents?
[2:41:26.340 --> 2:41:28.180]  But I mean, this is the mass mental illness.
[2:41:28.740 --> 2:41:30.580]  I remember 10 years ago, I first heard
[2:41:30.580 --> 2:41:32.100]  at major colleges, people got upset
[2:41:32.100 --> 2:41:33.300]  they had Play-Doh and toys.
[2:41:33.300 --> 2:41:34.260]  That's real.
[2:41:34.260 --> 2:41:35.700]  Well, it'd be one thing.
[2:41:35.700 --> 2:41:37.380]  The world has always had crazy people.
[2:41:37.380 --> 2:41:38.980]  They didn't used to drive the bus.
[2:41:39.540 --> 2:41:41.380]  They didn't used to run the asylum.
[2:41:41.380 --> 2:41:43.620]  They didn't used to run the universities.
[2:41:43.620 --> 2:41:45.380]  They used to run the nuclear base.
[2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:47.940]  They didn't used to run the most dangerous
[2:41:47.940 --> 2:41:50.420]  and powerful aspects of our civilization.
[2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:53.460]  And you think about it, people who used to behave like that.
[2:41:53.460 --> 2:41:57.380]  You know, hey, that's just crazy Bill, crazy Jenny.
[2:41:57.380 --> 2:41:58.420]  You know, they were just kind of like,
[2:41:58.420 --> 2:41:59.620]  hey, leave them be.
[2:41:59.620 --> 2:42:00.820]  You know, they're just doing their thing.
[2:42:00.820 --> 2:42:02.500]  Yeah, he just got about out.
[2:42:02.500 --> 2:42:03.300]  My God.
[2:42:03.300 --> 2:42:04.420]  Yeah, he goes home every night.
[2:42:04.420 --> 2:42:06.500]  Shave his head bald, puts red lipstick on,
[2:42:06.500 --> 2:42:07.700]  and you know, thinks he's a dog.
[2:42:07.700 --> 2:42:09.540]  Yeah, he doesn't bother anyone.
[2:42:09.540 --> 2:42:10.500]  I mean, he runs the nuclear.
[2:42:10.500 --> 2:42:11.780]  Yeah, oh, oh, what that?
[2:42:11.780 --> 2:42:13.540]  He always, it's handling the nuclear.
[2:42:13.540 --> 2:42:14.420]  Oh, got you.
[2:42:14.420 --> 2:42:14.900]  Oh boy.
[2:42:14.900 --> 2:42:15.220]  Okay.
[2:42:16.020 --> 2:42:18.740]  And somebody, somebody made a good point about
[2:42:18.740 --> 2:42:19.700]  you're trying to be a woman.
[2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:20.820]  You want to be a woman.
[2:42:20.820 --> 2:42:23.860]  And the outfit didn't even dress, lady.
[2:42:23.860 --> 2:42:25.060]  It didn't even make sense.
[2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:26.420]  Oh, they make it hideous on purpose.
[2:42:26.420 --> 2:42:28.100]  You, you see these drag queen story times,
[2:42:28.100 --> 2:42:29.300]  the kids are recoiling.
[2:42:29.300 --> 2:42:33.540]  Looks like they look scarier than hit the clown.
[2:42:33.540 --> 2:42:34.980]  They look like demons.
[2:42:34.980 --> 2:42:36.340]  But they're twerking for freedom.
[2:42:37.140 --> 2:42:37.620]  Yes.
[2:42:37.620 --> 2:42:38.260]  That's right.
[2:42:38.260 --> 2:42:41.780]  I mean, look, I mean, dude, that is a clown.
[2:42:41.780 --> 2:42:43.300]  That is a demon clown.
[2:42:44.260 --> 2:42:46.500]  Doesn't look like a man, doesn't look like a woman,
[2:42:46.500 --> 2:42:48.420]  the most unattractive thing on earth,
[2:42:48.420 --> 2:42:49.300]  and charge the nukes.
[2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:52.100]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com.
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:52.820]  Stay with us.
[2:42:52.820 --> 2:42:54.260]  Can he meow though?
[2:42:54.260 --> 2:42:55.220]  Because you know what he meow?
[2:42:55.220 --> 2:42:55.540]  I.
[2:42:55.540 --> 2:43:00.180]  The globalists are doing everything they can
[2:43:00.180 --> 2:43:02.900]  to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[2:43:02.900 --> 2:43:05.940]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:43:05.940 --> 2:43:07.140]  And if you look at the studies,
[2:43:07.140 --> 2:43:10.660]  the number one cause of marriages breaking up
[2:43:10.660 --> 2:43:13.860]  is the fact that the men cannot satisfy
[2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:15.220]  their women in the bedroom.
[2:43:15.220 --> 2:43:16.900]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:43:16.900 --> 2:43:18.180]  And even if you're like me,
[2:43:18.180 --> 2:43:19.780]  and hardly ever have a problem,
[2:43:19.780 --> 2:43:21.700]  I mean, all of us one for another, too.
[2:43:21.700 --> 2:43:22.740]  That's just the truth.
[2:43:22.740 --> 2:43:23.940]  The liberals will make fun of that,
[2:43:23.940 --> 2:43:25.140]  but everybody knows that's true.
[2:43:25.140 --> 2:43:26.900]  But whether you rarely have any issues,

[2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:32.100]  with the wars, with the collapsing wars,
[2:44:32.100 --> 2:44:33.220]  everything's happening,
[2:44:33.220 --> 2:44:35.140]  is one of the most important things you can make
[2:44:35.140 --> 2:44:36.980]  is to have high-quality, storeable food,
[2:44:36.980 --> 2:44:38.820]  water filtration, air filtration, and more.
[2:44:38.820 --> 2:44:39.940]  And it's not just those items,
[2:44:39.940 --> 2:44:41.700]  it's hundreds of other high-quality,

[2:44:49.620 --> 2:44:51.380]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:44:51.380 --> 2:44:52.740]  one of the most important things you can do
[2:44:52.740 --> 2:44:54.340]  is get ahead of inflation now,
[2:44:54.340 --> 2:44:56.420]  because inflation is just beginning.
[2:44:56.420 --> 2:44:58.660]  We brought the game-changing product,
[2:44:58.660 --> 2:45:01.220]  previously only available to major oil companies
[2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:03.940]  around the world, to the civilian market two years ago,
[2:45:03.940 --> 2:45:07.300]  the Biopros, for septic tanks, for porta-potties,
[2:45:07.300 --> 2:45:10.740]  for RVs, for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:12.660]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway,
[2:45:12.660 --> 2:45:14.260]  it'll just add water.
[2:45:14.260 --> 2:45:16.420]  But it's been so successful now,
[2:45:16.420 --> 2:45:19.940]  we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms,
[2:45:19.940 --> 2:45:23.860]  you name it, because this stuff will eat anything
[2:45:23.860 --> 2:45:25.460]  that is organic.
[2:45:25.460 --> 2:45:29.700]  And it's exclusively available at thebiopros.com,
[2:45:29.700 --> 2:45:31.860]  and now infowarstore.com.
[2:45:31.860 --> 2:45:34.100]  We sold out of this for almost a year,
[2:45:34.100 --> 2:45:36.100]  but we made a major purchase,
[2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:39.220]  and it is now in stock for whatever your need is
[2:45:39.220 --> 2:45:40.660]  at infowarstore.com.

[2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:58.340]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet,
[2:45:58.340 --> 2:46:00.500]  especially as you get older, you gain weight,
[2:46:00.500 --> 2:46:02.100]  even if you eat a lot less.
[2:46:02.100 --> 2:46:04.900]  But I gotta tell you, info wars is only about
[2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:07.460]  bringing you amazing products that really work.

[2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:13.620]  and we said, what are the best-selling,
[2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:17.300]  natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products
[2:46:17.300 --> 2:46:18.180]  that are out there?
[2:46:18.180 --> 2:46:19.940]  And we went and looked at the top 10,
[2:46:19.940 --> 2:46:22.980]  and they all had the same ingredients in common
[2:46:22.980 --> 2:46:24.340]  that is in this product.
[2:46:24.340 --> 2:46:28.260]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force,
[2:46:28.260 --> 2:46:30.740]  we got the very best concentrates
[2:46:30.740 --> 2:46:34.500]  of these known natural essences
[2:46:34.500 --> 2:46:36.820]  that show amazing things for your body.
[2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:38.660]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds,
[2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.180]  I'm so a little bit overweight,
[2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:41.140]  in the last three months,
[2:46:41.140 --> 2:46:44.980]  and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[2:46:44.980 --> 2:46:48.260]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now
[2:46:48.260 --> 2:46:51.540]  at infowarstore.com, 40% off.
[2:46:51.540 --> 2:46:53.780]  infowarstore.com, Diet Force.
[2:46:53.780 --> 2:47:18.100]  You need to take this product, it really works.
[2:47:18.100 --> 2:47:21.540]  So we really want to base our treatment
[2:47:21.540 --> 2:47:27.060]  and to affirm and to support and empower these youth,
[2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:30.260]  not to limit their participation in activities and sports,
[2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:33.940]  and even limit their ability to get gender affirmation
[2:47:33.940 --> 2:47:38.020]  treatment in their state.
[2:47:38.020 --> 2:47:39.460]  Not just a man in a dress,
[2:47:39.460 --> 2:47:43.140]  but a man in a Star Trek admiral outfit
[2:47:43.140 --> 2:47:45.620]  wants to have a sexual relationship with their children,
[2:47:45.620 --> 2:47:47.060]  not just to have sex with them,
[2:47:47.060 --> 2:47:50.820]  but to cut their testicles off or cut their breasts off.
[2:47:50.820 --> 2:47:55.060]  Isn't it amazing how you read books like 1984,
[2:47:55.060 --> 2:47:57.060]  growing up, or you see some of these movies,
[2:47:57.060 --> 2:48:00.100]  and it seems so far-fetched and impossible,
[2:48:00.100 --> 2:48:00.900]  but now here we are.
[2:48:00.900 --> 2:48:03.060]  I mean, look at that little 30-second clip
[2:48:03.060 --> 2:48:06.580]  and the complete projection,
[2:48:06.580 --> 2:48:08.260]  lying, reverse reality that happens.
[2:48:08.260 --> 2:48:08.580]  He says...
[2:48:08.580 --> 2:48:10.180]  We want to protect your children.
[2:48:10.180 --> 2:48:13.940]  We want to empower the youth, really,
[2:48:13.940 --> 2:48:16.500]  by genitally mutilating them?
[2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:16.900]  What?
[2:48:16.900 --> 2:48:18.180]  That's empowering.
[2:48:18.180 --> 2:48:20.260]  Chop your balls off.
[2:48:20.260 --> 2:48:22.100]  They're empowering the sick parents.
[2:48:22.100 --> 2:48:24.420]  They're empowering the perverted school teachers.
[2:48:24.420 --> 2:48:25.540]  That's who they're empowering.
[2:48:25.540 --> 2:48:26.260]  And, Jacob, you're right.
[2:48:26.260 --> 2:48:28.420]  It's the sick liberal parents that go,
[2:48:28.420 --> 2:48:29.860]  our four-year-old, our three-year-old,
[2:48:29.860 --> 2:48:31.460]  says they're a girl or a boy
[2:48:31.460 --> 2:48:32.740]  when they're the opposite gender.
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:33.860]  I mean, what's sick of...
[2:48:33.860 --> 2:48:34.820]  I mean, just look at that.
[2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:35.860]  I mean, look at that.
[2:48:35.860 --> 2:48:36.580]  I mean, come on.
[2:48:36.580 --> 2:48:37.300]  And then...
[2:48:37.300 --> 2:48:38.020]  Gender after me.
[2:48:38.020 --> 2:48:39.300] ...revolting people.
[2:48:39.300 --> 2:48:42.660]  I mean, it's an offensive thing.
[2:48:42.660 --> 2:48:46.740]  It's all about having being publicly offensive
[2:48:46.740 --> 2:48:49.060]  and walking around in that state of...
[2:48:49.060 --> 2:48:51.540]  in that state where you can be just...
[2:48:51.540 --> 2:48:53.140]  And saying, I'm going to have a relationship
[2:48:53.140 --> 2:48:53.620]  with your children.
[2:48:53.620 --> 2:48:54.580]  We have all the videos.
[2:48:54.580 --> 2:48:56.260]  We're going to groom your kids, period.
[2:48:56.260 --> 2:48:58.660]  It's a conquering technique is what it is.
[2:48:58.660 --> 2:49:01.860]  It's a psychological conquering technique
[2:49:01.860 --> 2:49:03.060]  where they know they shouldn't be...
[2:49:03.060 --> 2:49:04.500]  Oh, I mean, look.
[2:49:04.500 --> 2:49:06.180]  I mean, that looks like the most...
[2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:07.620]  That looks scarier than at the clown.
[2:49:07.620 --> 2:49:09.380]  I mean, you could have that person
[2:49:09.380 --> 2:49:11.140]  in Rob Zombie's new horror movie.
[2:49:11.140 --> 2:49:11.700]  Yeah.
[2:49:11.700 --> 2:49:12.740]  You don't think she's beautiful?
[2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:17.060]  I'm stunning and brave.
[2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:20.980]  Gender affirmation by telling kids
[2:49:20.980 --> 2:49:22.580]  they're not the gender they are.
[2:49:22.580 --> 2:49:24.260]  That's gender affirmation.
[2:49:24.260 --> 2:49:25.940]  It's by telling them there's something they're not.
[2:49:26.740 --> 2:49:27.220]  And that's what...
[2:49:27.220 --> 2:49:28.180]  Well, I mean, I'll just say it.
[2:49:28.180 --> 2:49:29.780]  These are the pedophile generals.
[2:49:29.780 --> 2:49:31.780]  They are the field marshals of pedophilia.
[2:49:31.780 --> 2:49:34.100]  Well, yeah, you've got Peter O'Pete, apparently,
[2:49:34.100 --> 2:49:34.820]  in the White House.
[2:49:34.820 --> 2:49:36.980]  You've got now Judge Jackson on the Supreme Court
[2:49:36.980 --> 2:49:38.100]  who's a big...
[2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:39.380]  Does have sex with kids?
[2:49:39.380 --> 2:49:41.540]  Big claim of fame, protecting pedophiles.
[2:49:41.540 --> 2:49:42.660]  So, I mean, this is it.
[2:49:42.660 --> 2:49:43.620]  So let me ask you both then,
[2:49:43.620 --> 2:49:46.420]  shifting gears, you can keep going with this if you want.
[2:49:46.420 --> 2:49:47.220]  What's the big picture?
[2:49:47.220 --> 2:49:50.020]  What's front and center for Jacob Engels and Owen Troyer?
[2:49:50.020 --> 2:49:53.540]  Well, I think we stay on this topic for a second.
[2:49:53.540 --> 2:49:55.940]  Owen and I discussed it on yesterday's show.
[2:49:55.940 --> 2:49:58.740]  You have the people like Richard Levine.
[2:49:58.740 --> 2:50:00.740]  You have Judge Jackson.
[2:50:00.740 --> 2:50:02.900]  But you have these judicial candidates
[2:50:02.900 --> 2:50:05.380]  and individuals across the country
[2:50:05.380 --> 2:50:07.700]  who defended pedophiles in private practice,
[2:50:07.700 --> 2:50:09.460]  who are running for circuit count,
[2:50:09.460 --> 2:50:10.820]  circuit court judge.
[2:50:10.820 --> 2:50:12.340]  And that's how you get started.
[2:50:12.340 --> 2:50:14.580]  So it's not just on the Supreme Court.
[2:50:14.580 --> 2:50:16.180]  It's not just in the White House.
[2:50:16.180 --> 2:50:17.780]  It's in your local communities.
[2:50:17.780 --> 2:50:19.620]  And we've seen what's happening in the school boards
[2:50:19.620 --> 2:50:20.740]  and the county commissions,
[2:50:20.740 --> 2:50:23.220]  but people really need to research the individuals
[2:50:23.220 --> 2:50:24.660]  running for local judge.
[2:50:24.660 --> 2:50:27.220]  So Epstein's kind of the top of the pyramid.
[2:50:27.220 --> 2:50:29.780]  But as you go below, this is how they recruit and control.
[2:50:29.780 --> 2:50:30.980]  Yeah.
[2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:31.780]  And...
[2:50:31.780 --> 2:50:34.020]  Oh, yeah, teachers were severely given pre-team students,
[2:50:34.020 --> 2:50:36.020]  pre-property bloggers, behind parents' back.
[2:50:36.020 --> 2:50:38.580]  I mean, that is criminal beyond belief.
[2:50:38.580 --> 2:50:39.780]  And now it came out,
[2:50:39.780 --> 2:50:42.980]  the CDC directs elementary students to secret chat rooms
[2:50:42.980 --> 2:50:44.180]  about changing their gender.
[2:50:44.180 --> 2:50:45.460]  I mean, damn.
[2:50:45.460 --> 2:50:48.020]  You put your child in the public school, you're crazy.
[2:50:48.020 --> 2:50:48.820]  That's...
[2:50:48.820 --> 2:50:50.180]  And a lot of private schools are done.
[2:50:50.180 --> 2:50:51.220]  No, in the private schools,
[2:50:51.220 --> 2:50:52.820]  that's one thing people do not realize.
[2:50:52.820 --> 2:50:54.180]  The private schools are doing it
[2:50:54.180 --> 2:50:55.780]  just as much as the public schools.
[2:50:55.780 --> 2:50:56.980]  And that's even more concerning.
[2:50:56.980 --> 2:51:00.180]  Could you imagine giving, forking over $20,000 a year
[2:51:00.180 --> 2:51:03.620]  and then finding out they're doing that to your kids?
[2:51:03.620 --> 2:51:07.780]  Well, they make it financially beneficial to do it.
[2:51:07.780 --> 2:51:10.580]  You get grants, government grants, contracts.
[2:51:10.580 --> 2:51:14.580]  You know, you get a better deal on your Microsoft or Apple package.
[2:51:14.580 --> 2:51:16.180]  Which, again, let's talk big picture.
[2:51:16.180 --> 2:51:18.980]  We know it's a bunch of mentally old pedophiles at the bottom
[2:51:18.980 --> 2:51:20.180]  and the administration,
[2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:22.980]  but the globalists admit it's about the population.
[2:51:22.980 --> 2:51:24.980]  Well, that's why, Alex, to go to the larger question,
[2:51:24.980 --> 2:51:26.980]  I mean, I do draw back from this issue.
[2:51:26.980 --> 2:51:28.580]  And I think that...
[2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:31.380]  And if anything is the biggest story
[2:51:31.380 --> 2:51:35.780]  to actually get people to understand where the world is going,
[2:51:35.780 --> 2:51:39.780]  if we continue to embrace centralized government,
[2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:41.780]  corporate government,
[2:51:41.780 --> 2:51:43.780]  and just further remove ourselves
[2:51:43.780 --> 2:51:45.780]  from the Bill of Rights and the Constitution,
[2:51:45.780 --> 2:51:48.980]  I think the one that people can understand
[2:51:48.980 --> 2:51:50.980]  is the climate change issue.
[2:51:50.980 --> 2:51:52.980]  And obviously, a lot of people still believe it,
[2:51:52.980 --> 2:51:57.780]  but it's one of the easiestly debunked theories.
[2:51:57.780 --> 2:51:59.780]  It's one of the easiest things to debunk,
[2:51:59.780 --> 2:52:02.780]  whether when it was man-made global warming
[2:52:02.780 --> 2:52:04.780]  or now it's man-made climate change,
[2:52:04.780 --> 2:52:06.780]  it's one of the easiest things to debunk,
[2:52:06.780 --> 2:52:09.780]  and we're kind of in the opening phases now
[2:52:09.780 --> 2:52:11.780]  of people actually getting a taste
[2:52:11.780 --> 2:52:13.780]  of what these policies are going to do.
[2:52:13.780 --> 2:52:15.780]  Yeah, your grocery bills are going to go up
[2:52:15.780 --> 2:52:17.780]  if you even have groceries available at the store.
[2:52:17.780 --> 2:52:19.780]  You're not going to be able to afford gas.
[2:52:19.780 --> 2:52:21.780]  They're banning cows all over the world.
[2:52:21.780 --> 2:52:25.780]  So, I mean, this is really kind of the backbone
[2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.780]  of the entire New World Order.
[2:52:27.780 --> 2:52:30.780]  This is really the backbone of the depopulation,
[2:52:30.780 --> 2:52:32.780]  eugenesis New World Order.
[2:52:32.780 --> 2:52:34.780]  It is convincing people that man-made climate change
[2:52:34.780 --> 2:52:36.780]  is the biggest threat to the future
[2:52:36.780 --> 2:52:39.780]  and then signing the whole planet on the policies
[2:52:39.780 --> 2:52:41.780]  that are going to depopulate the planet.
[2:52:41.780 --> 2:52:44.780]  And so, I think this is the time
[2:52:44.780 --> 2:52:45.780]  where people can understand it.
[2:52:45.780 --> 2:52:48.780]  It's an easy thing to debunk.
[2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:51.780]  But even if they deny it now,
[2:52:51.780 --> 2:52:53.780]  things continue the way they are.
[2:52:53.780 --> 2:52:55.780]  No, that's right. We warn them now.
[2:52:55.780 --> 2:52:56.780]  They're going to listen later
[2:52:56.780 --> 2:52:58.780]  because they're just now sinking their teeth into us.
[2:52:58.780 --> 2:53:00.780]  Well, and we talk about now
[2:53:00.780 --> 2:53:04.780]  that we're trying to manufacture these meats
[2:53:04.780 --> 2:53:06.780]  that have human DNA in them
[2:53:06.780 --> 2:53:10.780]  and have, you know, human content.
[2:53:10.780 --> 2:53:12.780]  It's all just evil.
[2:53:12.780 --> 2:53:14.780]  It's all evil, but they preview this stuff.
[2:53:14.780 --> 2:53:16.780]  You've talked a lot about this, Alex,
[2:53:16.780 --> 2:53:17.780]  where they put it in movies.
[2:53:17.780 --> 2:53:20.780]  They put it in TV shows 10, 20, 30 years before
[2:53:20.780 --> 2:53:22.780]  to normalize it, to get it in your brain.
[2:53:22.780 --> 2:53:24.780]  So then when you see it, you're just like,
[2:53:24.780 --> 2:53:27.780]  oh, okay, I guess that's happening.
[2:53:27.780 --> 2:53:29.780]  And you're not outraged because you've been programmed.
[2:53:29.780 --> 2:53:30.780]  And how are we different?
[2:53:30.780 --> 2:53:32.780]  I'm not saying we're amazing or something,
[2:53:32.780 --> 2:53:34.780]  but the more they try to program it,
[2:53:34.780 --> 2:53:35.780]  the more I get away.
[2:53:35.780 --> 2:53:37.780]  Other people, I guess they're unconscious,
[2:53:37.780 --> 2:53:38.780]  it just programs them.
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:40.780]  How do we get people to shift out of just being programmed
[2:53:40.780 --> 2:53:42.780]  and see what's happening?
[2:53:42.780 --> 2:53:45.780]  You know, the difficulty is
[2:53:45.780 --> 2:53:47.780]  because a lot of people are lazy, Alex.
[2:53:47.780 --> 2:53:50.780]  They want to leave an easy and lazy life.
[2:53:50.780 --> 2:53:54.780]  But even though the desire for some people
[2:53:54.780 --> 2:53:57.780]  to live easy, lazy lives,
[2:53:57.780 --> 2:54:00.780]  their desire to still be in control of their life,
[2:54:00.780 --> 2:54:03.780]  I think will trump that in the long run.
[2:54:03.780 --> 2:54:05.780]  So it's getting them to understand, hey, look, I get it.
[2:54:05.780 --> 2:54:07.780]  You really think you can get free money.
[2:54:07.780 --> 2:54:09.780]  You really think the government can run your life
[2:54:09.780 --> 2:54:11.780]  and all this crap.
[2:54:11.780 --> 2:54:14.780]  Even if you ever got close to that pipe dream
[2:54:14.780 --> 2:54:18.780]  that will never exist, you'll be a total slave.
[2:54:18.780 --> 2:54:21.780]  And so if they ever figure that out,
[2:54:21.780 --> 2:54:22.780]  then maybe these people...
[2:54:22.780 --> 2:54:23.780]  No, that's it.
[2:54:23.780 --> 2:54:24.780]  The whole thing is about being a chump
[2:54:24.780 --> 2:54:27.780]  and buying into a scam, thinking you're smart.
[2:54:27.780 --> 2:54:29.780]  No, it's hellish.
[2:54:29.780 --> 2:54:31.780]  I mean, globalism is pure death.
[2:54:31.780 --> 2:54:33.780]  That's why I look at the college loan forgiveness thing
[2:54:33.780 --> 2:54:35.780]  as one of the dumbest things ever.
[2:54:35.780 --> 2:54:37.780]  Because, like, for example, all these Democrats
[2:54:37.780 --> 2:54:40.780]  writing bills to pass student loan forgiveness,
[2:54:40.780 --> 2:54:41.780]  they're all in debt.
[2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:43.780]  They just want free money at the end of the day.
[2:54:43.780 --> 2:54:44.780]  Let's talk about that.
[2:54:44.780 --> 2:54:48.780]  And I'm having an Alzheimer's moment here, early Alzheimer's.
[2:54:48.780 --> 2:54:49.780]  Who's the...
[2:54:49.780 --> 2:54:51.780]  He was gonna come on the show, but Cody's coming on soon.
[2:54:51.780 --> 2:54:52.780]  Who's the famous guy
[2:54:52.780 --> 2:54:54.780]  that does the great little three-minute breakdown
[2:54:54.780 --> 2:54:58.780]  of people take the shot that doesn't protect them?
[2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:00.780]  He was gonna come on the show, guys.
[2:55:00.780 --> 2:55:01.780]  Jim Brewer.
[2:55:01.780 --> 2:55:02.780]  Oh, the comedian?
[2:55:02.780 --> 2:55:03.780]  Yeah, there's a two-minute clip we have
[2:55:03.780 --> 2:55:04.780]  that Rob do had the full clip.
[2:55:04.780 --> 2:55:05.780]  It's on Band-Aid video.
[2:55:05.780 --> 2:55:07.780]  Get Jim Brewer ready for the start of the next hour,
[2:55:07.780 --> 2:55:08.780]  like, six after.
[2:55:08.780 --> 2:55:11.780]  Because he says it all, and he illustrates it.
[2:55:11.780 --> 2:55:13.780]  Have you guys seen the new...
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:14.780]  Comedy special?
[2:55:14.780 --> 2:55:15.780]  Harrison Smith clip.
[2:55:15.780 --> 2:55:16.780]  Yes, that's great.
[2:55:16.780 --> 2:55:18.780]  He did one that went super viral,
[2:55:18.780 --> 2:55:20.780]  20 million views or whatever.
[2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:21.780]  This was all he got, like, a million views.
[2:55:21.780 --> 2:55:24.780]  It needs to get seen where he actually uses their own quotes
[2:55:24.780 --> 2:55:25.780]  about the vaccine.
[2:55:25.780 --> 2:55:27.780]  I mean, isn't that the best example, Owen,
[2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:30.780]  or Jacob, of how people think they're getting a good deal,
[2:55:30.780 --> 2:55:31.780]  but it's a total lie,
[2:55:31.780 --> 2:55:33.780]  and how the deeper they get in, they won't admit it?
[2:55:33.780 --> 2:55:36.780]  No, and I think, to some respect,
[2:55:36.780 --> 2:55:39.780]  they have bought in to those policies
[2:55:39.780 --> 2:55:41.780]  and to those programs,
[2:55:41.780 --> 2:55:43.780]  and nobody ever wants to admit they're wrong.
[2:55:43.780 --> 2:55:46.780]  So, you know, you've made 100 bad decisions,
[2:55:46.780 --> 2:55:50.780]  and you realize the past 50 of those 100 decisions
[2:55:50.780 --> 2:55:53.780]  were horrible, but it's their whole persona,
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:55:54.780]  it's their whole aura.
[2:55:54.780 --> 2:55:56.780]  And I'll say this, when I was younger,
[2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:57.780]  I didn't know it was wrong.
[2:55:57.780 --> 2:55:59.780]  Being an adult means you admit you're wrong,
[2:55:59.780 --> 2:56:00.780]  so you change it.
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:02.780]  Even when you know you're wrong, it's hard to change.
[2:56:02.780 --> 2:56:04.780]  They won't even admit anything's wrong.
[2:56:04.780 --> 2:56:09.780]  And the easy, free lifestyle that Owen's talking about,
[2:56:09.780 --> 2:56:12.780]  I think, you know, it sucks what's going on with gas,
[2:56:12.780 --> 2:56:13.780]  what's going on with food prices,
[2:56:13.780 --> 2:56:15.780]  but maybe that's what they need,
[2:56:15.780 --> 2:56:17.780]  the financial wake-up call of...
[2:56:17.780 --> 2:56:19.780]  No, I agree, but they're going to use that crisis
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:21.780]  as a personal basic outcome and even deeper sliver.
[2:56:21.780 --> 2:56:22.780]  That's a good point.
[2:56:22.780 --> 2:56:25.780]  Yeah, and that's why it's such a catch-22 right now,
[2:56:25.780 --> 2:56:28.780]  because part of you is kind of looking at this like,
[2:56:28.780 --> 2:56:31.780]  hey, if you don't know what's going on now,
[2:56:31.780 --> 2:56:34.780]  if you're not politically aware and awakened and informed now,
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:37.780]  then I mean, how much worse does it have to get?
[2:56:37.780 --> 2:56:39.780]  I mean, how much, you know,
[2:56:39.780 --> 2:56:42.780]  wide open borders shutting our energy off?
[2:56:42.780 --> 2:56:43.780]  What else?
[2:56:43.780 --> 2:56:45.780]  But see, that's the thing, here's what people like, Alex.
[2:56:45.780 --> 2:56:46.780]  Oh, there's a virus?
[2:56:46.780 --> 2:56:49.780]  What a perfect excuse for me to stay inside for a month,
[2:56:49.780 --> 2:56:51.780]  watch Netflix, and the government's going to cut me a check.
[2:56:51.780 --> 2:56:53.780]  And anybody that's going to get in the way with that
[2:56:53.780 --> 2:56:55.780]  is obviously my enemy.
[2:56:55.780 --> 2:56:57.780]  And it's like, no, I understand,
[2:56:57.780 --> 2:57:00.780]  maybe I'm asking you not to be a lazy bum, but...
[2:57:00.780 --> 2:57:03.780]  But you just set the precedent to be obsolete and non-essential,
[2:57:03.780 --> 2:57:05.780]  and for this to come permanently.
[2:57:05.780 --> 2:57:06.780]  Exactly.
[2:57:06.780 --> 2:57:08.780]  And that's a badge of honor for them, though.
[2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:10.780]  They're like a fish, though, like a dumb bass
[2:57:10.780 --> 2:57:13.780]  would see a worm in the water and think, it's good.
[2:57:13.780 --> 2:57:15.780]  A smart bass comes up and looks and says, there's a hook.
[2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:16.780]  Yep.
[2:57:16.780 --> 2:57:18.780]  That's the older, bigger bass, little dumb ones.
[2:57:18.780 --> 2:57:20.780]  Teach the catch little fish, because they don't know.
[2:57:20.780 --> 2:57:23.780]  I got to say something, though, before we end this hour.
[2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:26.780]  I'm rethinking my entire wardrobe going on air,
[2:57:26.780 --> 2:57:29.780]  and I'm thinking the track jumpsuit.
[2:57:29.780 --> 2:57:31.780]  I mean, he looks so...
[2:57:31.780 --> 2:57:33.780]  Well, we're all Russian agents.
[2:57:33.780 --> 2:57:34.780]  He looks so good and comfortable.
[2:57:34.780 --> 2:57:36.780]  I kind of want to put a tracksuit on and do a...
[2:57:36.780 --> 2:57:37.780]  Hold on.
[2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:39.780]  Guys, we're going to come back over a little while,
[2:57:39.780 --> 2:57:41.780]  and then we've got Wayne Eleanoroo coming up.

[2:58:15.780 --> 2:58:17.780]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them

[2:58:56.780 --> 2:59:00.780]  but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[2:59:00.780 --> 2:59:02.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research

[2:59:41.780 --> 3:00:10.780]  I can't wait for the reviews because it's worked great for me.
[3:00:11.780 --> 3:00:14.780]  But to sell us tyranny, they got to scramble our brains
[3:00:14.780 --> 3:00:15.780]  and get us used to it.
[3:00:15.780 --> 3:00:19.780]  It's all behavioral psychologists.
[3:00:19.780 --> 3:00:21.780]  But the behavioral psychologists running all this,
[3:00:21.780 --> 3:00:23.780]  they're destroying their own futures as well.
[3:00:23.780 --> 3:00:25.780]  Jacob Ingalls, Owen Schreuer,
[3:00:25.780 --> 3:00:28.780]  how do we end that blind spot that we'll have
[3:00:28.780 --> 3:00:29.780]  and get them to stop being evil?
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:30.780]  I guess they're not going to stop.
[3:00:30.780 --> 3:00:31.780]  We've just got to stop them.
[3:00:31.780 --> 3:00:37.780]  We can do everything we can to deprogram and inform
[3:00:37.780 --> 3:00:39.780]  and just try to be the best people, the best examples.
[3:00:39.780 --> 3:00:42.780]  But at the end of the day, people are going to have it for themselves
[3:00:42.780 --> 3:00:43.780]  and they're going to have to learn.
[3:00:43.780 --> 3:00:44.780]  They're going to have to learn.
[3:00:44.780 --> 3:00:47.780]  And sadly, a lot of the times, people have to learn the hard way.
[3:00:47.780 --> 3:00:50.780]  I know I learned a lot of things the hard way in my life.
[3:00:50.780 --> 3:00:53.780]  Some things I figured out before learning the hard way.
[3:00:53.780 --> 3:00:55.780]  But you hate to think we're reaching the point now
[3:00:55.780 --> 3:00:58.780]  where we're all going to have to go through the hard way together
[3:00:58.780 --> 3:01:00.780]  because some of us didn't learn it.
[3:01:00.780 --> 3:01:02.780]  But the left, the more it gets worse for them personally,
[3:01:02.780 --> 3:01:03.780]  the more they double down.
[3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:04.780]  Jacob Ingalls.
[3:01:04.780 --> 3:01:05.780]  Yeah, and that's the problem.
[3:01:05.780 --> 3:01:07.780]  We used to have this concept of self-determination
[3:01:07.780 --> 3:01:11.780]  in this country of charting your own path, of being your own person.
[3:01:11.780 --> 3:01:15.780]  And now they've been so brainwashed to listen to the government,
[3:01:15.780 --> 3:01:18.780]  listen to the corporations, listen to the TV, films.
[3:01:18.780 --> 3:01:20.780]  Which any idiot knows isn't smart.
[3:01:20.780 --> 3:01:23.780]  Which is why now when I meet these people out in public,
[3:01:23.780 --> 3:01:25.780]  I don't want to get vicious.
[3:01:25.780 --> 3:01:28.780]  So I kind of just laugh and I say, you're right, I love the government.
[3:01:28.780 --> 3:01:30.780]  I do everything the government and TV tell me to do.
[3:01:30.780 --> 3:01:32.780]  Because that's when they really get mad.
[3:01:32.780 --> 3:01:35.780]  So it's funny, when I was on the plane coming here,
[3:01:35.780 --> 3:01:38.780]  going through the airport, I was just walking through the airport.
[3:01:38.780 --> 3:01:41.780]  And everyone I go by said, I love Dr. Fauci.
[3:01:41.780 --> 3:01:42.780]  I love him.
[3:01:42.780 --> 3:01:43.780]  I love him so much.
[3:01:43.780 --> 3:01:44.780]  Isn't it great?
[3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:46.780]  I want the mask back.
[3:01:46.780 --> 3:01:47.780]  I want more booster.
[3:01:47.780 --> 3:01:48.780]  I want more vaccine.
[3:01:48.780 --> 3:01:51.780]  And you could just see people somewhere laughing,
[3:01:51.780 --> 3:01:54.780]  but others are just like, ooh, ooh, how dare you?
[3:01:54.780 --> 3:01:56.780]  In fact, I've thought about doing it,
[3:01:56.780 --> 3:01:58.780]  but I can't physically make myself lie,
[3:01:58.780 --> 3:01:59.780]  even if it's satire to be a lie,
[3:01:59.780 --> 3:02:02.780]  of like hosting whole shows from the point of the globalist.
[3:02:02.780 --> 3:02:04.780]  I mean, you imagine what that would be like.
[3:02:04.780 --> 3:02:07.780]  Well, yeah, I mean, just promote death.
[3:02:07.780 --> 3:02:09.780]  And you start from there.
[3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:11.780]  Just start rolling down from there.
[3:02:11.780 --> 3:02:13.780]  But that's what it is.
[3:02:13.780 --> 3:02:15.780]  Because they think they're anti-establishment.
[3:02:15.780 --> 3:02:17.780]  And that's kind of like their whole like...
[3:02:17.780 --> 3:02:18.780]  What?
[3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:19.780]  Oh, they're anti-establishment.
[3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:21.780]  They have the whole power pressure behind them.
[3:02:21.780 --> 3:02:22.780]  Yeah.
[3:02:22.780 --> 3:02:23.780]  But that's a good point.
[3:02:23.780 --> 3:02:25.780]  I made it some of these abortion parties
[3:02:25.780 --> 3:02:27.780]  when they're saying their chance to have...
[3:02:27.780 --> 3:02:28.780]  Explain that.
[3:02:28.780 --> 3:02:32.780]  You call these pro-abortion things, pro-abortion parties.
[3:02:32.780 --> 3:02:33.780]  Well, they are abortion parties.
[3:02:33.780 --> 3:02:34.780]  They had an open bar.
[3:02:34.780 --> 3:02:36.780]  They held it at a concert venue.
[3:02:36.780 --> 3:02:37.780]  Then they come out in the street,
[3:02:37.780 --> 3:02:38.780]  liquored up, drunk,
[3:02:38.780 --> 3:02:40.780]  marching all over the place.
[3:02:40.780 --> 3:02:42.780]  And I stood in their way,
[3:02:42.780 --> 3:02:43.780]  and they got really pissed off.
[3:02:43.780 --> 3:02:44.780]  Screaming, I love killing babies.
[3:02:44.780 --> 3:02:46.780]  Screaming, I love killing babies.
[3:02:46.780 --> 3:02:48.780]  I'll slit their throat, so drink their blood.
[3:02:48.780 --> 3:02:49.780]  So they've gone from it.
[3:02:49.780 --> 3:02:50.780]  It's a woman's choice.
[3:02:50.780 --> 3:02:51.780]  I love killing babies.
[3:02:51.780 --> 3:02:52.780]  Yes.
[3:02:52.780 --> 3:02:53.780]  And they want to eat them, too.
[3:02:53.780 --> 3:02:54.780]  That's what the One Lady said.
[3:02:54.780 --> 3:02:56.780]  And he has this all-on film, by the way.
[3:02:56.780 --> 3:02:57.780]  Yeah.
[3:02:57.780 --> 3:02:58.780]  You got a channel on Band-Aid Video.
[3:02:58.780 --> 3:02:59.780]  Yes, yes.
[3:02:59.780 --> 3:03:01.780]  Jacob Ingalls on Band-Aid Video, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:03:01.780 --> 3:03:04.780]  And you're on gab at Jacob Ingalls, CentralFordipost.com.
[3:03:04.780 --> 3:03:06.780]  But going to break here,
[3:03:06.780 --> 3:03:09.780]  but what else have you seen at the pro-abortion rallies?
[3:03:09.780 --> 3:03:11.780]  Just disgusting things.
[3:03:11.780 --> 3:03:15.780]  You have children that are carrying around wire hangers.
[3:03:15.780 --> 3:03:19.780]  You have children whose parents have painted uteruses
[3:03:19.780 --> 3:03:21.780]  that are bleeding on them.
[3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:23.780]  You have all this stuff that they're doing to the kids.
[3:03:23.780 --> 3:03:24.780]  It's another form of grooming.
[3:03:24.780 --> 3:03:27.780]  It's not the sexuality aspect of it.
[3:03:27.780 --> 3:03:28.780]  It's a cult.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:29.780]  It's a cult.
[3:03:29.780 --> 3:03:30.780]  It is.
[3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:32.780]  And those who have had those are killing kids.
[3:03:32.780 --> 3:03:33.780]  Damn right.
[3:03:33.780 --> 3:03:34.780]  It's a cult.
[3:03:34.780 --> 3:03:35.780]  And they had even a dog.
[3:03:35.780 --> 3:03:38.780]  They put some vest on a dog saying,
[3:03:38.780 --> 3:03:39.780]  I'm for abortion rights.
[3:03:39.780 --> 3:03:43.780]  Let that labradoodle be.
[3:03:43.780 --> 3:03:44.780]  Yeah.
[3:03:44.780 --> 3:03:47.780]  The old saying, the cat didn't choose to be vegan,
[3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:49.780]  or I don't know how they say it.
[3:03:49.780 --> 3:03:52.780]  Cats aren't the ones choosing to be vegan, it's the parents.
[3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:54.780]  It's like your cat didn't choose to be vegan.
[3:03:54.780 --> 3:03:55.780]  Yeah.
[3:03:55.780 --> 3:03:57.780]  Your kid didn't want to be, probably, want to be vegan either.
[3:03:57.780 --> 3:04:00.460]  they recognize that now that one woman
[3:04:00.460 --> 3:04:04.540]  gave her kid a vegan diet kid Melnir's died she got sued she's going to jail
[3:04:04.540 --> 3:04:08.300]  good well that's the thing is that i don't believe the best looking guy on the
[3:04:08.300 --> 3:04:09.700]  world or whatever
[3:04:09.700 --> 3:04:11.780]  i go to a conservative rally people look
[3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:15.100]  good their eyes are awake the black white old gentleman
[3:04:15.100 --> 3:04:18.020]  you go to a leprosy event they look like they've been shot with a mutation
[3:04:18.020 --> 3:04:21.780]  ring i mean they look like hell well and and in their eyes you look in their
[3:04:21.780 --> 3:04:23.940]  eyes and it's just black
[3:04:23.940 --> 3:04:26.420]  it is it's like
[3:04:26.420 --> 3:04:28.540]  a demon has taken them
[3:04:28.540 --> 3:04:32.460]  and is not going to let go and then their pump full of the drugs
[3:04:32.460 --> 3:04:33.920]  there on the booze
[3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:37.440]  and then they have the brainwashing going on so i don't know how you get
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:39.180]  some of these people off though
[3:04:39.180 --> 3:04:42.740]  i walk into these crowds and just in the back of my head
[3:04:42.740 --> 3:04:45.100]  it's like
[3:04:45.100 --> 3:04:47.900]  do
[3:04:47.900 --> 3:04:53.300]  you know here i go to the abortion party for coming right back stay with us
[3:04:53.300 --> 3:05:01.760]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a
[3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:06.420]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done
[3:05:06.420 --> 3:05:07.420]  these profiles.
[3:05:07.420 --> 3:05:08.420]  You see it every year.
[3:05:08.420 --> 3:05:13.460]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:19.260]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[3:05:19.260 --> 3:05:22.660]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[3:05:22.660 --> 3:05:23.660]  this and knowing this.
[3:05:23.660 --> 3:05:29.260]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:05:29.260 --> 3:05:34.500]  to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of
[3:05:34.500 --> 3:05:35.500]  your money.
[3:05:35.500 --> 3:05:40.260]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:05:40.260 --> 3:05:46.980]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[3:05:46.980 --> 3:05:53.980]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[3:06:16.980 --> 3:06:35.980]  I got my second shot April 19th.
[3:06:46.980 --> 3:06:51.980]  See this bucket of virus?
[3:06:51.980 --> 3:06:54.980]  I'm vaccinating.
[3:06:54.980 --> 3:06:56.980]  I'll even lick a metal.
[3:06:56.980 --> 3:07:00.980]  I'm not afraid of anything.
[3:07:02.980 --> 3:07:04.980]  People vaccinated are getting sick.
[3:07:04.980 --> 3:07:06.980]  What?
[3:07:14.980 --> 3:07:15.980]  People sold?
[3:07:15.980 --> 3:07:17.980]  You need a new booster.
[3:07:20.980 --> 3:07:21.980]  Who wants a shot?
[3:07:21.980 --> 3:07:23.980]  Who wants to see a ball game?
[3:07:30.980 --> 3:07:32.980]  Wave your flipper.
[3:07:34.980 --> 3:07:35.980]  That's for you.
[3:07:35.980 --> 3:07:37.980]  Go see the ball game.
[3:07:37.980 --> 3:07:39.980]  Who wants to work again?
[3:07:39.980 --> 3:07:40.980]  Again.
[3:07:44.980 --> 3:07:46.980]  That's for you.
[3:07:46.980 --> 3:07:48.980]  Who wants your kids educated?
[3:07:52.980 --> 3:07:53.980]  What's in the shot?
[3:07:53.980 --> 3:07:54.980]  It's safe.
[3:07:54.980 --> 3:07:55.980]  Don't worry.
[3:07:55.980 --> 3:07:56.980]  Don't worry.
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:03.980]  Go ahead.
[3:08:03.980 --> 3:08:10.980]  Get it, get it.
[3:08:13.980 --> 3:08:15.980]  The closest negative is everything is,
[3:08:15.980 --> 3:08:17.980]  there is a global awakening,
[3:08:17.980 --> 3:08:21.980]  and humanity's got a real shot at beating this,
[3:08:21.980 --> 3:08:22.980]  but the energy shutdown,
[3:08:22.980 --> 3:08:23.980]  we're talking during the break,
[3:08:23.980 --> 3:08:24.980]  I said, what's the biggest thing?
[3:08:24.980 --> 3:08:27.980]  We all agree it's the shutdown of the energy,
[3:08:27.980 --> 3:08:29.980]  the banning of the cows all over the world,
[3:08:29.980 --> 3:08:30.980]  the collapse of all these countries.
[3:08:30.980 --> 3:08:32.980]  How do we counter that?
[3:08:32.980 --> 3:08:34.980]  What's the biggest thing that's happening?
[3:08:38.980 --> 3:08:40.980]  We have to let it accelerate.
[3:08:40.980 --> 3:08:42.980]  It has to accelerate to the point where
[3:08:42.980 --> 3:08:45.980]  every day Americans wake up and join us in this car.
[3:08:45.980 --> 3:08:47.980]  They are overthrowing all the governments they've done?
[3:08:47.980 --> 3:08:48.980]  Yes,
[3:08:48.980 --> 3:08:50.980]  if you look at something like Netherlands and a lot of these
[3:08:50.980 --> 3:08:52.980]  countries where that's happening,
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:54.980]  people are saying, wow, it's so amazing,
[3:08:54.980 --> 3:08:56.980]  but they don't realize those countries have been
[3:08:56.980 --> 3:08:59.980]  over socialist and communist rule for decades,
[3:08:59.980 --> 3:09:01.980]  and it's taken them this long to wake up,
[3:09:01.980 --> 3:09:05.900]  pushing towards the communism. Can't we just bypass it and be like Florida?
[3:09:05.900 --> 3:09:10.940]  I, you know, if we could clone Ron DeSantis, I think that would be great.
[3:09:10.940 --> 3:09:15.100]  You know, that's a great way to put it though, Alex. I would love to bypass this. You know,
[3:09:15.100 --> 3:09:20.940]  I wish we could bypass this, but I think the bypass surgery is, you know, I just don't
[3:09:20.940 --> 3:09:22.860]  know if the opportunity... Do you think it's in the river mirror?
[3:09:22.860 --> 3:09:27.020]  I think it might be. It might be. I mean, we'll see how these midterms go, and then
[3:09:27.020 --> 3:09:30.220]  we'll see what happens after that, but... You know they're gonna steal it. I mean...
[3:09:30.220 --> 3:09:34.220]  I don't know why they wouldn't. They stole those Georgia Senate seats right in front of our eyes,
[3:09:34.220 --> 3:09:37.260]  even after they stole the presidential election, so they're gonna be just as...
[3:09:37.260 --> 3:09:40.380]  So let me interrupt. Oh, and what do you make... I'm glad you raised that of this
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:45.500]  martial law bill, H.R. 435-0, that's on the Defense Authorization Act that makes the
[3:09:45.500 --> 3:09:48.620]  president an dictator. And Republicans aren't even that upset about it.
[3:09:48.620 --> 3:09:51.260]  Four war with the American people. Is this for right-wingers?
[3:09:51.260 --> 3:09:56.860]  So here's what I... The story with these bills kind of goes like this. When they write them,
[3:09:56.860 --> 3:10:03.180]  they don't plan on using them immediately. They usually bring it back 10, 20 years later
[3:10:03.180 --> 3:10:06.220]  and really clamp it down. I mean, look at the Patriot Act, Alex. I mean, you were on top of
[3:10:06.220 --> 3:10:13.260]  that, and you had the same sets of urgency, but now is when the Patriot Act is really coming into
[3:10:13.260 --> 3:10:17.180]  effect. Now they're going after the American people. They're going after the veterans.
[3:10:17.180 --> 3:10:22.220]  They're spying on them. They're imprisoning them, and that all that precedent, all that idea comes
[3:10:22.220 --> 3:10:27.100]  from the Patriot Act. And so now is when it's really heavy. It's like, hey, we didn't act. We
[3:10:27.100 --> 3:10:30.540]  didn't get how big of a deal it was back then. So that's kind of how you look at this.
[3:10:30.540 --> 3:10:33.500]  We're not going to see... I don't think they're going to use this to put Biden into a position
[3:10:33.500 --> 3:10:36.060]  of power, but it'll be the guy eight years, 12 years.
[3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:40.460]  Oh, yeah. I've been mobbed by comments. They won't make... It's the president becomes a dictator.
[3:10:40.460 --> 3:10:42.060]  Yeah. With no congressional oversight.
[3:10:42.060 --> 3:10:45.740]  Yeah. So, I mean, that's just another one of those deals where it's going to come back on us
[3:10:45.740 --> 3:10:49.020]  down the road. I agree with you, but it took 20 years to get to the Patriot Act.
[3:10:49.020 --> 3:10:52.300]  Everything is compressed now. That'll take a year to get to this.
[3:10:53.100 --> 3:10:57.180]  Well, and is this the bill that had the provisions that Adam Schiff put in there?
[3:10:57.180 --> 3:11:01.660]  Yeah. It says, right wing extremists, the Pentagon will be used against us domestically,
[3:11:01.660 --> 3:11:06.060]  and the Congress has no oversight of domestic military operations. That's illegal under the
[3:11:06.060 --> 3:11:10.300]  Constitution. Well, and so maybe there's some writing on the wall that they're seeing,
[3:11:10.300 --> 3:11:12.620]  trying to protect themselves, going into the midterms. Maybe.
[3:11:12.620 --> 3:11:18.860]  And I agree. And if the 400 Uvaldi police couldn't save the kids, and if we couldn't win the war
[3:11:18.860 --> 3:11:22.620]  in Vietnam, I'm not looking for a war with the military and police. But if I was the
[3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:25.980]  military and police, I would not want the deep state to start a fight with us. I mean,
[3:11:25.980 --> 3:11:30.940]  look, we don't want to fight. It's like we're like an 800 pound gorilla and like a two pound
[3:11:30.940 --> 3:11:32.940]  weasels trying to start a fight with us. It ain't going to go well.
[3:11:32.940 --> 3:11:37.500]  But that's why I think what Jacob said in the beginning is that kind of is what leads to that
[3:11:37.500 --> 3:11:41.260]  belief of we need it to accelerate a little bit. Because look, the average American out there is
[3:11:41.260 --> 3:11:45.500]  a good person, but the bread and circus still goes on. So you guys are accelerationists?
[3:11:45.500 --> 3:11:48.060]  I'm really not. I really don't like to think this way.
[3:11:48.060 --> 3:11:52.780]  But because I've been trying to stop this. But then I get your point once we get here.
[3:11:52.780 --> 3:11:58.620]  It's it's it's just when you when you when you try to sit down and really talk it out. I understand
[3:11:58.620 --> 3:12:02.460]  that the acceleration. I've been a decelerationist. Well, I mean, I would say if anything, we're just
[3:12:02.460 --> 3:12:07.180]  an outright pump the brakes. Let's pump the brakes on you, Dennis, for a little bit. Maybe we
[3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:11.020]  should stop that may pump the brakes on Satanism for a couple of decades. Exactly. We're jamming
[3:12:11.020 --> 3:12:14.220]  the brakes to the floor. Yeah, but but it's getting to the point now where it's like, all right,
[3:12:14.220 --> 3:12:18.380]  all right, we've been prepared. We've no I agree. That's where I've got now. It's almost a sense
[3:12:18.380 --> 3:12:25.660]  of peace. I'm like, I tried to stop this and well, but also you have to showcase the insanity
[3:12:25.660 --> 3:12:31.020]  and the absolute absurdity of it all. And so that's why I think I'm in favor of accelerating it
[3:12:31.020 --> 3:12:36.700]  because the more and more we let them push forward and forward and get weirder like that lady that's
[3:12:36.700 --> 3:12:42.300]  doing the nuclear energy and Dr. Levin. I mean, it's got to reach a point where Americans sit
[3:12:42.300 --> 3:12:48.780]  there and say, oh, this is this is just bad. Well, it's like how it's like, hey, we warned you,
[3:12:48.780 --> 3:12:51.980]  they were going to shut your energy off. It's like, oh, they didn't shut your energy off. Oh,
[3:12:51.980 --> 3:12:56.220]  really, it just cost you $500 to fill your gas tank. You're right. They didn't have to turn it off.
[3:12:56.220 --> 3:12:59.980]  They just priced you out of it. That was now they have cooling centers you predicted a year ago,
[3:13:00.860 --> 3:13:04.620]  because you read documents, they'll be cooling centers where your powers off. You got to go
[3:13:04.620 --> 3:13:10.300]  to a sports stadium. That's now in LA. That's now in Berlin. So that's why it's like, look, I don't
[3:13:10.300 --> 3:13:14.620]  believe me. I don't want that. I don't want people to not even be the poor people to be living in
[3:13:14.620 --> 3:13:18.780]  100 degree heat, 24 seven, because they can't afford to cool their houses. That's not what I
[3:13:18.780 --> 3:13:23.260]  want. So I'm not an accelerationist, but I'm just saying the bread and circus goes on until the
[3:13:23.260 --> 3:13:27.580]  bread and circus doesn't. And that's when people are going to say, Hey, where's my bread and circus?
[3:13:27.580 --> 3:13:31.580]  And you're going to say, well, I told you who took it. And then it all burns down,
[3:13:31.580 --> 3:13:35.980]  which costs a lot. He thinks the angrier world will bring their power in. But as long as they're
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:40.140]  being exposed, being behind it, it'll be their waterloo. But that's why that's why I think the
[3:13:40.140 --> 3:13:45.980]  accelerationist attitude is there. Because like you said, Alex, it's an 800 pound gorilla versus
[3:13:45.980 --> 3:13:51.260]  a little ferret. And as soon as and if it's an acceleration, if it if getting this to people's
[3:13:51.260 --> 3:13:55.820]  front doors is what it's going to take to get that 800 pound gorilla up and saying, Hey,
[3:13:56.540 --> 3:14:00.620]  we got to turn on the gas. Yeah, we got to we got to open the coal mines. We got to shut the
[3:14:00.620 --> 3:14:05.340]  board. The pedophiles leave our kids alone. Yeah. Yeah. All right, Jacob Ingalls, you're going to

[3:20:10.780 --> 3:20:15.980]  All right, Wayne Alleroots here as I always am on Tuesday afternoons or
[3:20:15.980 --> 3:20:21.500]  Tuesday mornings as it were in Las Vegas. It's noon, noonish here in Las Vegas actually this
[3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:28.060]  afternoon and it could have been a disastrous report from Las Vegas today. As we were getting ready
[3:20:28.060 --> 3:20:34.460]  for this show, reports started flying in that there was an explosion at the Hoover Dam. You talk
[3:20:34.460 --> 3:20:40.700]  about tragedy for the United States of America. It's right up there with the big one hitting Los
[3:20:40.700 --> 3:20:46.700]  Angeles and millions of people being their houses destroyed in rubble and thousands dead. Well,
[3:20:46.700 --> 3:20:52.300]  if you ever destroyed the Hoover Dam, there'd be no water for the entire Southwest United States.
[3:20:52.300 --> 3:20:57.580]  Las Vegas, Phoenix would all be without water. We turn it to a parts desert. All our houses would
[3:20:57.580 --> 3:21:03.500]  be worthless. And the Southwest United States would cease to exist. Hoover Dam and explosion as
[3:21:03.500 --> 3:21:08.700]  we went to press as it were as I was about to come on the air with all of you on the Alex Jones
[3:21:08.700 --> 3:21:15.100]  show here at info wars. And I'm happy to report that it was a transformer explosion. It was relatively
[3:21:15.100 --> 3:21:22.620]  minor. The videos of it on the spot look like a gigantic mushroom cloud of dark smoke. But it was
[3:21:22.620 --> 3:21:27.980]  really relatively minor. They say they put it out at the dam before the fire department ever got
[3:21:27.980 --> 3:21:33.820]  there. And there is no disaster to report. Thank God. Because here I am in Las Vegas. Imagine
[3:21:33.820 --> 3:21:39.420]  I said, Wayne root coming to you. No water coming out of the faucets. No electricity. Las Vegas is
[3:21:39.420 --> 3:21:45.100]  down and out. Can you imagine the entire American Southwest has no water for the foreseeable future?
[3:21:45.100 --> 3:21:51.340]  Everything's okay. So if you saw those reports, it is a false alarm. Everything is okay. What's
[3:21:51.340 --> 3:21:58.620]  not okay is the rest of the United States of America. The rest of the USA is a freaking disaster.
[3:21:59.180 --> 3:22:05.980]  So, you know, the food plants burning to the ground, food processing facilities exploding
[3:22:05.980 --> 3:22:13.740]  for natural gas pipelines blown up in the last week. The supply chain ruined. Open borders with
[3:22:13.740 --> 3:22:21.580]  millions streaming over. A disaster of epic proportions. Airlines every weekend and every
[3:22:21.580 --> 3:22:27.820]  day but particularly weekends. So many thousands of flights canceled and delayed because of the
[3:22:27.820 --> 3:22:34.620]  COVID mandates. Pilots out sick. Pilots refusing to work. Pilots forced into retirement. We have
[3:22:34.620 --> 3:22:41.020]  a disaster in our hands in every aspect of this country. Supply chain, food, gasoline, energy,
[3:22:41.020 --> 3:22:48.620]  travel. It's a disaster. And it's only getting worse. Let me read you my column though that came
[3:22:48.620 --> 3:22:55.180]  out just a few days ago. Nationally syndicated by Creator Syndicate. And I think you'll really,
[3:22:56.940 --> 3:23:02.700]  it'll resonate with you. You'll hear this column and go, wow, he's right. The GOP is asleep at the
[3:23:02.700 --> 3:23:08.940]  switch that they want to lose. My column is about the upcoming midterm elections. And while I believe
[3:23:08.940 --> 3:23:15.100]  if the elections were fair, we'd absolutely win by a landslide, the biggest landslide in the history
[3:23:15.100 --> 3:23:21.180]  of politics. We'd win and win and win maybe 80 to 100 seats in the house that we'd sweep the Senate.
[3:23:21.180 --> 3:23:27.260]  But it's not fair. It's not honest. They're rigging them again. The Democrat plant is
[3:23:27.260 --> 3:23:34.940]  still the midterms. Say goodbye to Biden and say hello to King Kong, monkey COVID. Do you think
[3:23:34.940 --> 3:23:39.580]  the GOP will win in a landslide victory in the November midterms? Do you think it will be a
[3:23:39.580 --> 3:23:46.060]  cakewalk? Boy, are you naive. I've been warning about what's coming for many months on my nationally
[3:23:46.060 --> 3:23:52.140]  syndicated radio show, Wayne Allerut, Ron Unfiltered on USA Radio Network. It's all starting to happen
[3:23:52.140 --> 3:23:57.580]  just as my crystal ball predicted. I'm sorry to say. First, I've been warning nonstop that
[3:23:57.580 --> 3:24:04.140]  Democrats are planning to steal the 2020 midterms just as they stole the 2020 presidential election.
[3:24:04.140 --> 3:24:09.100]  More on that in a moment. Second, I've been warning that Democrats and their PR wing in the
[3:24:09.100 --> 3:24:17.820]  mainstream media are planning to bring back COVID hysteria again just in time to steal the midterms.
[3:24:17.820 --> 3:24:25.100]  This is the perfect timing to demand universal mail-in ballots with no voter ID or signature
[3:24:25.100 --> 3:24:31.340]  match to steal the midterms. Third, I've been warning that Democrats would find a way to force
[3:24:31.340 --> 3:24:38.620]  Joe Biden out of office and then blame this whole economic disaster and food shortage and supply
[3:24:38.620 --> 3:24:45.980]  chain disaster on him, thereby deflecting blame from the Democrat Congress. Don't look now,
[3:24:45.980 --> 3:24:52.300]  but it's all starting to happen just as I predicted. The signs are all there. First, COVID,
[3:24:52.300 --> 3:24:59.100]  it's back just as I predicted. Like Freddy Krueger, I'm back just as I predicted for many months.
[3:24:59.100 --> 3:25:06.380]  Just read the tea leaves. The WHO just recommended indoor masks for everyone and Fauci just
[3:25:06.380 --> 3:25:12.860]  recommended indoor masks for everyone. And New York has mandated indoor masks officially and
[3:25:12.860 --> 3:25:18.380]  outdoors if you're in a crowd. And Los Angeles is mandating indoor masks starting in two weeks.
[3:25:18.940 --> 3:25:26.380]  Both cities, New York and LA, claim to be inundated with new COVID cases. More tea leaves to read.
[3:25:26.380 --> 3:25:35.260]  China shut down all the Macau casinos. MGM, Wynn, they've all got casinos in Macau, Las Vegas Sands,
[3:25:35.260 --> 3:25:40.140]  and they shut them down for a week. As of yesterday, they extended it for another week.
[3:25:40.140 --> 3:25:45.420]  That's how that happened last time. Two weeks to save the country, and then another two weeks,
[3:25:45.420 --> 3:25:49.420]  and then a month, and then two months, and then three months. That's how it all happens.
[3:25:50.540 --> 3:25:57.180]  More tea leaves. In the UK, the media is warning of new lockdowns coming. Lockdowns, not masks.
[3:25:57.180 --> 3:26:04.780]  Lockdowns. Biden's HHS secretary is warning of a bad COVID outbreak this fall. How does he know?
[3:26:04.780 --> 3:26:09.980]  Does he have a crystal ball? I've got a crystal ball. Everything I say in the media comes true.
[3:26:09.980 --> 3:26:17.180]  99.999% of the time for the last seven years, but I'm a conspiracy theorist. But all the liberals
[3:26:17.180 --> 3:26:22.860]  in the media and the Biden administration, nothing they ever predict ever comes true. But he knows
[3:26:22.860 --> 3:26:27.020]  for a fact we're going to have a COVID outbreak this fall. You know why he knows it? Because the
[3:26:27.020 --> 3:26:33.980]  election is this fall. And then there's monkeypox. The gay community is panicking in New York City
[3:26:33.980 --> 3:26:40.780]  and San Francisco. They're lined up like obedient sheep for monkeypox vaccines, as if they haven't
[3:26:40.780 --> 3:26:47.340]  had enough of one, two, three, and more of the COVID vaccines that are killing people
[3:26:47.340 --> 3:26:54.060]  at a rate I cannot even believe. More on that later in the show. Added a new outbreak of Marburg
[3:26:54.060 --> 3:27:01.180]  virus in Africa. So far, there are two victims, but they're both dead, two for two, 100% death rate,
[3:27:01.180 --> 3:27:07.100]  and polio is showing up again all around the world from Africa to Ukraine. There's even traces
[3:27:07.100 --> 3:27:15.260]  of polio virus isolated in the wastewater of London. Oh, it's coming. You can see the tsunami
[3:27:15.260 --> 3:27:22.460]  forming. Remember, Democrats never let a crisis go to waste. Those are the words of Rom Emanuel.
[3:27:22.460 --> 3:27:30.060]  Whether it's a new scarier version of COVID or a merger of monkey COVID or King Kong COVID
[3:27:30.060 --> 3:27:37.820]  or polio or Marburg virus, Democrats and their PR wing, the mainstream media will soon be inundating
[3:27:37.820 --> 3:27:45.500]  you with scary news to make you hysterical, hide in your home for months on end, mask up and suffocate
[3:27:45.500 --> 3:27:52.220]  yourself with face diapers and get your 25th vaccine. This is how they will try and cheat,
[3:27:52.220 --> 3:27:57.980]  rig and steal the bit terms with millions of fake mail in ballots with no voter ID and no
[3:27:57.980 --> 3:28:05.500]  signature match. It's the 2020 game plan, but updated with even scarier names for new variants
[3:28:05.500 --> 3:28:10.140]  and new diseases. I'll continue with my column when we get back. We're taking a short break.
[3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:16.140]  I want to mention I'm Wayne Allen root. My website's root for America.com. My email's
[3:28:16.140 --> 3:28:21.980]  Wayne root at gmail.com and my national radio show is Wayne Allen root raw and unfiltered
[3:28:21.980 --> 3:28:28.220]  on USA radio. If it's not available where you are on traditional radio, just go to root
[3:28:28.220 --> 3:28:32.700]  for America.com and right at the top click and you're listening to my national radio show
[3:28:32.700 --> 3:28:56.380]  6 to 9 p.m. Eastern every night. We'll be right back. War. If you're like myself and so many
[3:28:56.380 --> 3:29:00.540]  other people on this planet, especially as you get older, you gain weight even if you eat a lot
[3:29:00.540 --> 3:29:06.620]  less. I got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[3:29:06.620 --> 3:29:10.460]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said,
[3:29:11.420 --> 3:29:17.340]  what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[3:29:17.340 --> 3:29:22.700]  We went and looked at the top 10. They all had the same ingredients in common that is in this
[3:29:22.700 --> 3:29:30.860]  product. But with our new product from x7 diet force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[3:29:30.860 --> 3:29:37.820]  known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body. And so I've lost almost 40 pounds.
[3:29:37.820 --> 3:29:42.780]  I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months and I've been doing it using diet force
[3:29:42.780 --> 3:29:49.260]  and also exercise. Well now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com
[3:29:49.260 --> 3:29:54.940]  40% off infowarstore.com diet force. You need to take this product. It really works.
[3:29:56.700 --> 3:30:01.900]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[3:30:01.900 --> 3:30:07.180]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages. And if you look at the studies, the number one
[3:30:07.180 --> 3:30:14.140]  cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[3:30:14.140 --> 3:30:18.780]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem,
[3:30:18.780 --> 3:30:22.780]  I mean all of us at one point or another do. That's just the truth. The liberals will make fun of
[3:30:22.780 --> 3:30:26.380]  that but everybody knows that's true. But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a
[3:30:26.380 --> 3:30:32.860]  regular basis, InstaHard is the number one best-selling natural herbal supplement in the world

[3:33:15.900 --> 3:33:21.660]  This is my Alex Jones birthday show and I'm proud to be with you. Lots of great things going on.
[3:33:21.660 --> 3:33:28.460]  I wish you were with me last week, last Saturday, this past weekend at Freedom Fest, the biggest
[3:33:28.460 --> 3:33:33.340]  conference every year in Las Vegas, about 3,000 people attending and every year I've got the
[3:33:33.340 --> 3:33:38.700]  starring role in the big debate at Freedom Fest, usually me against the liberal. Sometimes it's
[3:33:38.700 --> 3:33:45.260]  me as a team, a tag team. I was with Candace Owens two years ago or three years ago before COVID.
[3:33:45.260 --> 3:33:49.740]  It was me and Candace and a tag team debating about the Trump administration and the job they
[3:33:49.740 --> 3:33:56.140]  were doing this time. It was just me up against a liberal journalist to debate was the 2020 election
[3:33:56.140 --> 3:34:02.780]  stolen a one hour debate. And this is why the media doesn't ever want to let Wayne Root debate
[3:34:02.780 --> 3:34:08.620]  with them about stolen elections because I knocked the guy out baby destroyed him. As a matter of
[3:34:08.620 --> 3:34:13.340]  fact, the crowd boot him off the stage. He was a very nice guy by the way. And he was very respectful
[3:34:13.340 --> 3:34:18.220]  to me. And we were very friendly offstage both before and after the debate, which is the way I
[3:34:18.220 --> 3:34:23.500]  am. But during a debate, I'm intense. I'm an ex football player. And I was going at him like a,
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:29.660]  you know, a flying demon. And I destroyed him. And the crowd literally twice boot him off the
[3:34:29.660 --> 3:34:35.260]  stage and the moderator had asked me to get the crowd under control that, you know, Hey,
[3:34:35.260 --> 3:34:40.460]  listen, let a guy talk, you got to tell him to let the guy talk Wayne. They love you. You're
[3:34:40.460 --> 3:34:46.380]  winning the bait. We get that. Can you tell them to let him talk? This is not the lions and the
[3:34:46.380 --> 3:34:52.140]  Christians in front of the Romans, you know, so I asked the crowd to quiet down twice and they did.
[3:34:52.140 --> 3:34:57.580]  But when it was over, they voted it was a landslide victory for yours truly. I'm now five and oh,
[3:34:57.580 --> 3:35:03.500]  five debates at Freedom Fest, five years in a row. I debated at Freedom Fest with the biggest debate
[3:35:04.140 --> 3:35:09.740]  of the central issue of our time and five and oh, thank you to that audience who is so clearly
[3:35:09.740 --> 3:35:15.580]  home field advantage for Wayne Alleroo. Nice people, all great patriots, some libertarians,
[3:35:15.580 --> 3:35:21.740]  some conservatives, some Republicans, all patriots, and all clearly see what's going on with America.
[3:35:21.740 --> 3:35:29.340]  And the media doesn't ever want a one on one debate with me and the two issues I could destroy
[3:35:29.340 --> 3:35:35.020]  them on actually three issues. One clowered pivot in the communist takeover the United States and
[3:35:35.020 --> 3:35:40.940]  the great reset. It's happening right now. Biden's not incompetent. Yes, he's an old man with dementia
[3:35:40.940 --> 3:35:47.420]  who wears diapers and a mask and has no idea where he is. He's not the one doing it. Obama is clearly
[3:35:47.420 --> 3:35:53.260]  the president of the United States in his third term, clearly the president of the United States.
[3:35:53.260 --> 3:36:00.060]  And it's all Obama is doing, not Biden is doing. So it's a communist takeover of our country.
[3:36:00.060 --> 3:36:04.620]  And I'll debate that with anyone anytime based on clowered pivot that I learned
[3:36:04.620 --> 3:36:10.940]  at Columbia University when I went there, class of 83 with Barack Hussein Obama. So that's number
[3:36:10.940 --> 3:36:17.740]  one. I'll debate you anytime. This is a purposeful intentional takedown of the United States and the
[3:36:17.740 --> 3:36:23.100]  US economy capitalism and the middle class. It's happening right now. Number two is the stolen
[3:36:23.100 --> 3:36:30.140]  election of 2020. I will take on anyone anytime. Do you hear me media? Do you hear me at CNN?
[3:36:30.140 --> 3:36:35.020]  Do you hear me MSNBC? Do you hear me Rachel Maddow? Do you hear me politicians in the
[3:36:35.020 --> 3:36:41.260]  Biden administration? Do you hear me Obama anytime anywhere? Anyone wants to debate in front of a
[3:36:41.260 --> 3:36:47.500]  crowd of thousands or on national TV, Wayne Root will debate the 2020 stolen election. I did it
[3:36:47.500 --> 3:36:52.300]  in front of 2000 people at Freedom Fest and every person that room when it was over knew
[3:36:52.300 --> 3:36:57.340]  that the election was stolen based on what I had to say. And I don't even base it on facts. I base
[3:36:57.340 --> 3:37:04.540]  it on stories of how absolutely positively you'd have to be a moron to not know the election was
[3:37:04.540 --> 3:37:09.500]  stolen. You know, it's right in front of your eyes. What do you believe your eyes or the lying
[3:37:09.500 --> 3:37:16.540]  media? So anytime anywhere, let's go. Come on. Let's go. Let's debate. And number three is the
[3:37:16.540 --> 3:37:24.140]  COVID vaccine. I'll debate anyone anywhere. Doctors, medical experts, scientists, Fauci, CDC
[3:37:24.140 --> 3:37:30.140]  experts, WHO experts, FDA experts, American Medical Association experts, the world's greatest
[3:37:30.140 --> 3:37:35.900]  brain surgeon. I don't care who it is. The head of MIT, the head of Harvard Medical School,
[3:37:35.900 --> 3:37:41.420]  head of John Hopkins Medical School. I will debate mass. I will debate vaccines. I will debate
[3:37:41.420 --> 3:37:46.620]  lockdowns. I will debate therapeutics and vitamins that should have been used. I've remectant,
[3:37:46.620 --> 3:37:53.820]  hydroxychloroquine, vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, quercetin, a selenium, probiotics, garlic,
[3:37:53.820 --> 3:37:59.660]  all of them, silver, structured silver and collodial silver. I will debate it with any of you.
[3:37:59.660 --> 3:38:06.300]  Dr. Fauci, do you have the balls to go for it? Let's go. Dr. Fauci with all his fancy degrees
[3:38:06.300 --> 3:38:11.980]  against Wayne Alleroot, the talk show host and the former professional sports gambler from Las
[3:38:11.980 --> 3:38:18.700]  Vegas. Let's see who fares better in a debate. I'll take my razor out and I'll slice you verbally
[3:38:18.700 --> 3:38:24.620]  the way I slice that liberal journalist in Las Vegas on Saturday in front of 2,000 people. Now,
[3:38:24.620 --> 3:38:29.340]  just so you know, I don't make these things up. Go to my website starting tomorrow. I don't know
[3:38:29.340 --> 3:38:35.900]  what time today it'll be up. So I'll say starting tomorrow, rootforamerica.com. And up on my website,
[3:38:36.460 --> 3:38:42.540]  rootforamerica.com will be the video of the debate. So you know I tell no lies. You'll see me
[3:38:42.540 --> 3:38:49.820]  destroy my opponent in the debate about the 2020 stolen election at rootforamerica.com.
[3:38:49.820 --> 3:38:55.580]  And when you go there, sign up so you're on my mailing list and whether it's there when you go
[3:38:55.580 --> 3:39:00.540]  there or it's a few hours late and you know it's not there, we'll mail it to you. Everybody,
[3:39:00.540 --> 3:39:05.820]  I have a mailing list at rootforamerica. There's the website and join my mailing list and we will
[3:39:05.820 --> 3:39:11.500]  literally send you an email with a link to my debate as soon as it's ready. We could put it up.
[3:39:11.500 --> 3:39:16.780]  You know, I'm not a technical guy, but they tell me it's a gigantic file that's so big it's taking
[3:39:16.780 --> 3:39:22.140]  hours to download. So it should be up later today, certainly by tomorrow, but we will email
[3:39:22.140 --> 3:39:28.940]  everyone on my list with the link to the video. Go to rootforamerica.com and just give your email
[3:39:28.940 --> 3:39:35.500]  address and you're on the list. That's it. All right. That's my challenge. Any liberal, any time
[3:39:35.500 --> 3:39:40.300]  about the communists take over the United States by the Biden Obama administration right now
[3:39:40.300 --> 3:39:45.740]  with Obama in his third term using clowered piven to usher in the great reset. Number one,
[3:39:45.740 --> 3:39:52.300]  number two, the stolen 2020 election. Number three, COVID vaccines. I'll debate anyone, any time,
[3:39:52.300 --> 3:39:58.620]  anywhere in a national forum on national TV or national radio or in front of a huge crowd.
[3:39:58.620 --> 3:40:02.940]  And you watch what I did to that guy in Las Vegas, go to rootforamerica.com. Now,
[3:40:02.940 --> 3:40:07.340]  let me finish up my commentary that went out this weekend. I started by telling you,
[3:40:07.340 --> 3:40:13.020]  they're going to rig and cheat and steal with the 2020 midterms the same way they did with the,
[3:40:13.020 --> 3:40:17.980]  assuming 2022 midterm, same way they did with the 2020 election. And they're going to do it
[3:40:17.980 --> 3:40:23.500]  by bringing COVID back and making people hysterical, even though doctors and hospitals
[3:40:23.500 --> 3:40:29.820]  are now saying the government is lying. There's lots of people with COVID. None of them are dying.
[3:40:29.820 --> 3:40:34.300]  None of them are hospitalized. None of them are seriously ill. You know what that's called?
[3:40:34.300 --> 3:40:41.020]  A cold. It's called the flu. It's gone on since the beginning of time. People get a boo boo.
[3:40:41.020 --> 3:40:45.740]  The world doesn't have to change. You don't need masks. They don't work. You don't need lockdowns.
[3:40:45.740 --> 3:40:49.500]  They don't work. They destroy the economy. Doesn't prevent anyone from getting sick.
[3:40:49.500 --> 3:40:54.460]  And the vaccines will only make you sicker because everybody with COVID almost exclusively
[3:40:54.460 --> 3:40:59.580]  is someone who's vaccinated. And by the way, you know what came out today? The most vaccinated
[3:40:59.580 --> 3:41:05.740]  nation in the world, enough with the dancing nurses. The most vaccinated nation in the world
[3:41:05.740 --> 3:41:12.460]  is New Zealand. And guess who has the most COVID in the world right now? Per capita. New Zealand.
[3:41:12.460 --> 3:41:16.940]  Per population. The most vaccinated nation in the world. The most COVID in the world.
[3:41:16.940 --> 3:41:22.620]  Just as I've been trying to tell you for two years. So part due to my narrative of a GOP
[3:41:22.620 --> 3:41:28.380]  landslide, everyone wants Biden gone. Even the most even the most liberal Democrat voters can't
[3:41:28.380 --> 3:41:33.900]  stand Biden anymore. The media can't stand Biden anymore. I predicted for weeks that Democrats
[3:41:33.900 --> 3:41:38.860]  would throw grandpa off of the plane. And I was right. Once again, read the tea leaves.
[3:41:38.860 --> 3:41:43.900]  The media is turned against Biden. Suddenly they're actually reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop.
[3:41:43.900 --> 3:41:49.740]  Another aspect of the stolen 2020 election that they literally blacked out that you couldn't see.
[3:41:49.740 --> 3:41:55.340]  It's clear they're laying the groundwork for Biden's departure. Democrats need a scapegoat.
[3:41:55.340 --> 3:42:01.580]  They have to blame this entire mess the country's in on someone. Joe Biden is a target rich
[3:42:01.580 --> 3:42:07.580]  environment. Meaning he's a helpless feeble old man with dementia. And the only question
[3:42:07.580 --> 3:42:13.100]  is timing. When can they throw grandpa from the plane? I see my countdown clock says
[3:42:13.100 --> 3:42:19.820]  about 30 seconds to go. I will finish part three of this when we get back. I'll tell you exactly
[3:42:19.820 --> 3:42:23.980]  how they're going to get rid of Joe Biden, who they're going to bring in. And believe me when I
[3:42:23.980 --> 3:42:29.340]  tell you it's not Kamala. If there's anyone in America more hated than Joe Biden, it's Kamala
[3:42:29.340 --> 3:42:35.420]  Harris because she's as incompetent as Biden. And what's her excuse? She doesn't even have dementia.
[3:42:35.420 --> 3:42:41.260]  She's just not very smart. Probably the dumbest politician ever in a high post in the history
[3:42:41.260 --> 3:42:46.780]  of America. How she got there. She's a black woman and they wanted a black woman. That's it.
[3:42:46.780 --> 3:42:51.180]  That's the only qualification on the resume of Kamala Harris. We'll be right back. I'll tell
[3:42:51.180 --> 3:43:00.780]  you how they're going to get rid of Biden. The globalist are doing everything they can to destroy
[3:43:00.780 --> 3:43:05.980]  heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages. And if you look at
[3:43:05.980 --> 3:43:12.540]  the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot
[3:43:12.540 --> 3:43:17.180]  satisfy their women in the bedroom. It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're
[3:43:17.180 --> 3:43:21.900]  like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the
[3:43:21.900 --> 3:43:25.420]  truth. The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true. But whether you
[3:43:25.420 --> 3:43:30.780]  rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis, InstaHeart is the number one bestselling
[3:43:30.780 --> 3:43:36.540]  natural herbal supplement in the world when it comes to male enhancement because it really works.

[3:44:01.180 --> 3:44:08.780]  brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince that the general public is in,
[3:44:08.780 --> 3:44:15.900]  the best word would actually be the people are lost. Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a
[3:44:16.700 --> 3:44:22.060]  bad nightmare or you're in a car or you can get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because
[3:44:23.260 --> 3:44:29.180]  you are totally dizzy and confused. You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have
[3:44:29.180 --> 3:44:34.940]  done. They have stunned us. They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then
[3:44:34.940 --> 3:44:39.420]  Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave speech. He called the great new narrative where he brags
[3:44:39.420 --> 3:44:44.620]  how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people
[3:44:44.620 --> 3:44:49.180]  are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff. That's what the great
[3:44:49.180 --> 3:44:54.540]  reset is. They need darkness to thrive. The light lives at infullwars.com.
[3:44:57.340 --> 3:45:02.460]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[3:45:02.460 --> 3:45:07.740]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages. And if you look at the studies, the number one
[3:45:07.740 --> 3:45:14.700]  cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[3:45:14.700 --> 3:45:19.340]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem,
[3:45:19.340 --> 3:45:23.340]  I mean all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth. The liberals will make fun of
[3:45:23.340 --> 3:45:27.020]  that but everybody knows that's true. But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a

[3:47:02.540 --> 3:47:15.740]  One, two, three. All right, Wayne Allyn Rood. Welcome back to the show. The Warriors with you.
[3:47:16.540 --> 3:47:23.340]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book is my hot new Beth Selling book. It'll be joined
[3:47:23.340 --> 3:47:29.500]  in September by the Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book. And I'll give you a list of the
[3:47:29.500 --> 3:47:36.380]  biggest and best corporations in America to buy from that are on our side, the good guy's side.
[3:47:36.380 --> 3:47:42.220]  But right now it's the bad guys list of all the companies you should boycott and a listing of
[3:47:42.220 --> 3:47:48.940]  all their contact information, the CEO's name, the board of directors name, the address to mail
[3:47:48.940 --> 3:47:53.580]  things to the email address, the phone number, how you get through to them, all of that in the
[3:47:53.580 --> 3:48:00.140]  Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book so we can make our voices heard. Let me continue on in this
[3:48:00.140 --> 3:48:07.180]  last segment of my abbreviated hour this week. Let me continue on with my column about the
[3:48:07.180 --> 3:48:13.740]  Democrat plan to steal the midterm, say goodbye to Biden and say hello to King Kong, monkey, COVID.
[3:48:13.740 --> 3:48:21.580]  Funny name I made up that, that of course gives you not only a laugh, but a look at how absurd it
[3:48:21.580 --> 3:48:27.580]  all is. Oh my God, it's King Kong COVID. I argued from day one that if I said to you, look, there's
[3:48:27.580 --> 3:48:34.220]  a monkey. You'd be like, okay, there's a monkey. But if I said, look, it's King Kong and he's eating
[3:48:34.220 --> 3:48:41.100]  the Empire State Building, the world would run in a horror and hysteria and panic and business would
[3:48:41.100 --> 3:48:47.180]  shut down and cars would smash into each other and the world would stop because King Kong is here.
[3:48:47.180 --> 3:48:55.660]  So when we gave COVID the name COVID, which is scary name, monkeypox, these are scary names,
[3:48:55.660 --> 3:49:03.500]  Marburg virus, Ebola. They scare you and they should because Marburg virus is deadly. Ebola is
[3:49:03.500 --> 3:49:11.580]  deadly. The girl screaming from King Kong. I love that. But COVID is not deadly. If you're a normal,
[3:49:11.580 --> 3:49:18.620]  healthy person, it's a cold. It's a minor flu. Don't get hysterical, but especially if you
[3:49:18.620 --> 3:49:23.660]  take Ivermectin. So in the last year, I've been out, you know, I'm a guy was one and a half.
[3:49:24.300 --> 3:49:29.180]  I know I think I have 6,000 numbers in my cell phone. I know a lot of people and a lot of them
[3:49:29.180 --> 3:49:33.100]  come to Vegas and I go to dinner, I go to lunch, got a lot of business associates, a lot of friends,
[3:49:33.100 --> 3:49:37.820]  a lot of fans and all over the United States and all over the world at my wedding where people from
[3:49:37.820 --> 3:49:43.580]  Portugal and England and I can't remember all the places they came from. So my point is I go out
[3:49:43.580 --> 3:49:47.740]  with these people and I tell them that all you have to do is take Ivermectin and COVID goes away
[3:49:47.740 --> 3:49:51.660]  in two days. And I'm not a doctor. I'm not a scientist. I'm not prescribing. I'm just telling
[3:49:51.660 --> 3:49:57.260]  you my experience from speaking of thousands of people and every single person I speak to goes,
[3:49:57.260 --> 3:50:02.700]  oh yeah, I've got like 300 tablets sitting in my refrigerator ready if something happens.
[3:50:02.700 --> 3:50:06.940]  And when I had COVID, three months ago, last month, one year ago, two years ago,
[3:50:06.940 --> 3:50:11.740]  whatever it was, whenever they had COVID, they took Ivermectin and went away in 24 to 48 hours.
[3:50:11.740 --> 3:50:16.940]  And I had COVID and went away in 24 to 48 hours and went away in 48 hours, but 24 hours after I
[3:50:16.940 --> 3:50:23.900]  took Ivermectin, it was gone. Now, nobody tells you that in the hospital. Nobody tells you that in
[3:50:23.900 --> 3:50:28.540]  the doctor's office. Matter of fact, they tell you it's a lie. They tell you that they slander it
[3:50:28.540 --> 3:50:32.620]  and they try and destroy Hydroxchloroquine and Ivermectin. And they will never tell you about
[3:50:32.620 --> 3:50:38.860]  vitamin C, vitamin D zinc and Corsetin, which have amazing effects against viruses of all kinds,
[3:50:38.860 --> 3:50:44.220]  not COVID, all viruses. They're antiviral and antibacterial. And there's many other
[3:50:44.220 --> 3:50:47.820]  wonderful things out there. I could give you a list. As a matter of fact, if you email me,
[3:50:47.820 --> 3:50:55.340]  wainroute at gmail.com, I will give you a list of all the things that I have compiled over the years
[3:50:55.340 --> 3:50:59.900]  that are great for your health and boosting your immune system and fighting off viruses,
[3:50:59.900 --> 3:51:05.260]  not COVID. I never said there's a cure for COVID. You're never going to get me government.
[3:51:05.260 --> 3:51:09.260]  There's no cure for COVID and I don't sell anything. I don't sell a single product. All I'm
[3:51:09.260 --> 3:51:13.900]  going to tell you is the vitamins that are very good for you to stay healthy, build your immune
[3:51:13.900 --> 3:51:19.020]  system and fight off viral infections of all kinds. And so I've got a great list, wainroute
[3:51:19.020 --> 3:51:24.220]  at gmail.com. Let me finish up and I can't tell you how many lives have been saved.
[3:51:24.220 --> 3:51:29.980]  And I'm not saying that. My audience says that. How many of my fans and friends have emailed me
[3:51:29.980 --> 3:51:34.780]  and texted me to tell me in the last year, thank God for you, wainroute. You saved my life. You
[3:51:34.780 --> 3:51:40.220]  saved my wife's life. You saved my family's life because we found out about vitamin C, vitamin D,
[3:51:40.220 --> 3:51:46.780]  Quarsten and zinc and Ivermectin or Hydroxychloroquine on your show. And it saved our life and we
[3:51:46.780 --> 3:51:50.940]  never went to any hospital and we never got seriously ill and COVID became a little cold.
[3:51:50.940 --> 3:51:58.700]  Or if they took it as a preventative, as they call it a prophylactic, a preventative,
[3:51:58.700 --> 3:52:02.460]  they never got COVID. And they said, thank you, wainroute. All these people got COVID,
[3:52:02.460 --> 3:52:07.100]  I never got sick, even though everyone in my family was sick because I took the Hydroxychloroquine.
[3:52:07.100 --> 3:52:12.060]  You may be asking, how did you get sick, wain? Well, first of all, I've been sick one time
[3:52:12.060 --> 3:52:18.460]  in 25 years, one time. And that was COVID last November. I think it was November,
[3:52:18.460 --> 3:52:24.620]  first or second, I got COVID. I am not a typical person like maybe you out there.
[3:52:24.620 --> 3:52:30.060]  Some people were not out that much. They were very careful. I never slowed down one day,
[3:52:30.060 --> 3:52:35.100]  one hour, one minute, one second due to COVID. I went out to dinner every night. I went out to
[3:52:35.100 --> 3:52:40.380]  business lunches every day. I was out and about in the world. I was speaking at conferences.
[3:52:40.380 --> 3:52:45.260]  I was speaking at people's homes. I was speaking at major events. I was the master of ceremonies.
[3:52:45.260 --> 3:52:49.900]  I was the keynote speaker. I was out in crowds 24 hours a day, seven days a week,
[3:52:49.900 --> 3:52:55.740]  the entire last two years of COVID, or almost two years of COVID. And I never slowed down,
[3:52:55.740 --> 3:53:01.020]  never locked down, never closed my business and never changed anything in my life and was
[3:53:01.020 --> 3:53:07.580]  constantly out in crowds without a mask and shook every hand and hugged every lady and hugged every
[3:53:07.580 --> 3:53:13.900]  guy and kissed every baby and never got sick except for once. And it was a mild 48 hours of
[3:53:13.900 --> 3:53:17.980]  COVID. So that's the story. How do I know it was COVID? I tested positive for COVID.
[3:53:17.980 --> 3:53:25.260]  I had a fever. I had a cough and I had a loss, a massive dramatic loss of taste for one day.
[3:53:25.260 --> 3:53:30.540]  And as soon as I took ivermectin, I was fine. And then as soon as I had a visiting nurse come over
[3:53:30.540 --> 3:53:35.180]  and give me intravenous vitamin C on top of the ivermectin, the taste came right back.
[3:53:35.180 --> 3:53:39.820]  And I was back to normal again. Let me finish my column on the Democrat plan,
[3:53:39.820 --> 3:53:44.620]  steal the midterms, say goodbye to Biden and say hello to King Kong, monkey COVID.
[3:53:45.900 --> 3:53:49.900]  So my prediction is Democrats are going to get rid of Biden. First they're going to blame COVID
[3:53:49.900 --> 3:53:53.340]  on why you need mail-in ballots, then they're going to get rid of Biden. So in the last three
[3:53:53.340 --> 3:53:56.940]  minutes this show, I want to tell you how they're going to get rid of Biden. Democrats will find
[3:53:56.940 --> 3:54:03.020]  a reason to remove Biden, Biden or force his resignation. And I predict it'll happen before
[3:54:03.020 --> 3:54:09.340]  the midterms. Why? First of all, he's in dramatic decline. It's so obvious everybody sees it.
[3:54:09.340 --> 3:54:13.500]  There's no time to spare. Joe Biden is going to drop dead or have a stroke
[3:54:13.500 --> 3:54:18.700]  or die of COVID right in front of all of us. If you don't remove him from office,
[3:54:18.700 --> 3:54:23.500]  this man will crumble in front of all of us. He's falling apart by this second.
[3:54:23.500 --> 3:54:30.220]  He's not there anymore. He was at least able to have some cognitive decent brain response
[3:54:30.220 --> 3:54:34.300]  during the debates. They gave him whatever pill and they shot him up with a needle with some kind
[3:54:34.300 --> 3:54:39.740]  of juice and gave him energy during the debates and he was passable. Not great, but he wasn't a
[3:54:39.740 --> 3:54:46.060]  cadaver. Today, no matter what they do, he's a walking cadaver. It's weekend at Biden's.
[3:54:46.060 --> 3:54:50.860]  If you remember a weekend at Bernie's, he's like a muppet and someone's got their hand up his butt
[3:54:50.860 --> 3:54:55.100]  and they're making his mouth move, but he doesn't even have a control over what's coming out anymore.
[3:54:55.100 --> 3:55:00.380]  So he's got to go. But number two, the reason why I think they'll force his resignation before
[3:55:00.380 --> 3:55:05.420]  the midterms is to change the narrative before the midterms. So they don't lose in a landslide.
[3:55:05.420 --> 3:55:09.100]  They're going to blame everything on Biden and throw him under the bus. And they're going to say
[3:55:09.100 --> 3:55:14.460]  it wasn't the Democrats. It wasn't our policies. It was Biden. And third, if they wait till after
[3:55:14.460 --> 3:55:21.100]  the midterms, they may face a GOP majority that would be unwilling to confirm the new
[3:55:21.100 --> 3:55:27.020]  vice president because they'll have to move Kamala up and the new VP will never get confirmed
[3:55:27.020 --> 3:55:31.180]  by Republican Congress. So they need to do it now. Well, they've got the majority.
[3:55:31.740 --> 3:55:36.300]  And so I think they're going to make Kamala president for now, but they're going to cut a deal
[3:55:36.300 --> 3:55:40.860]  with it is my prediction. She'll get the coveted title President of the United States that she
[3:55:40.860 --> 3:55:45.820]  can use for the rest of her family's legacy and life, right? She'll get big speaking deals,
[3:55:45.820 --> 3:55:50.780]  big book deals. She'll make millions. She'll always be President Kamala Harris. And in return,
[3:55:50.780 --> 3:55:56.700]  she'll agree to step down within one year and the new VP will become the president. So you watch
[3:55:56.700 --> 3:56:03.100]  whoever they name as the new VP for Kamala when she's moved up to president will be the chosen
[3:56:03.100 --> 3:56:08.860]  one for 2024 because they'll want an incumbent Democrat president running against president
[3:56:08.860 --> 3:56:13.100]  against former president Donald J. Trump, who we all know is the real legitimate president
[3:56:13.100 --> 3:56:18.700]  of the United States. My best guess is the California ego maniac governor and tyrant
[3:56:18.700 --> 3:56:25.020]  extraordinaire Gavin Newsom. Other possibilities, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama or transportation
[3:56:25.020 --> 3:56:31.180]  secretary Pete Butthead. That's what I call them. The bumbling, embarrassing stay at home mom
[3:56:31.180 --> 3:56:37.180]  who's ruined the supply chain of the United States. That's the short list. I know one thing,
[3:56:37.180 --> 3:56:43.740]  neither Biden or Kamala can ever be on the 2024 ticket or Trump will win in a landslide victory.
[3:56:43.740 --> 3:56:48.140]  And Democrats know that too. So the plan to steal the midterms is in the works,
[3:56:48.140 --> 3:56:55.100]  say hello to King Kong COVID and mail in voting and say goodbye to the man from dementia. And if
[3:56:55.100 --> 3:57:00.940]  that doesn't work out, there's always the option of pushing Putin into World War Three. But trust
[3:57:00.940 --> 3:57:06.140]  me, Democrats aren't going to sit back and allow a GOP landslide. These aren't run in the mill,
[3:57:06.140 --> 3:57:12.140]  Democrats. These aren't traditional Democrats. These are radical communist traders running
[3:57:12.140 --> 3:57:19.660]  today's Democrat Party and communists never willingly give up power. So we may win the
[3:57:19.660 --> 3:57:25.340]  midterms, but it's not going to be easy. And don't say I didn't warn you. They're trying to rig it
[3:57:25.340 --> 3:57:31.980]  right now. I'm Wayne Allyn Root, root for america.com. My email, WayneRootedGmail.com,

[3:58:52.060 --> 3:58:56.940]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement. It's basically
[3:58:56.940 --> 3:59:02.140]  the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization, and absurdity. It's
[3:59:02.140 --> 3:59:06.620]  like we're living in a twilight zone. All right, Eric's in New Hampshire. Eric, thanks for calling.
[3:59:06.620 --> 3:59:10.380]  Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out
[3:59:10.380 --> 3:59:15.180]  for the phone of the product. The X2 does wonders. I recommend it to everybody here on the fence
[3:59:15.180 --> 3:59:20.060]  about it. Get off the fence, get the product, support the infowar. Tyler in Maine, you're on
[3:59:20.060 --> 3:59:23.820]  the year. Thanks for holding it. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you. It's an honor.
[3:59:23.820 --> 3:59:29.340]  Honored talk to you. Awesome. So first thing I wanted to do is say I love the product,
[3:59:29.340 --> 3:59:35.260]  alpha power, even at 29. If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[3:59:35.260 --> 3:59:40.060]  So just number one for a few of you. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Absolutely.
[3:59:40.060 --> 3:59:51.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
