[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:18.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:18.000 --> 00:42.000]  On the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  $14 billion, that is just about exhausted.
[00:45.000 --> 00:49.000]  In fact, we started our assistance to Ukraine before this war began.
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  We sent Ukraine more security assistance last year, $650 million in weapons,
[00:54.000 --> 00:58.000]  including anti-air and anti-armor equipment, before the invasion.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  More than we had ever provided before.
[01:01.000 --> 01:06.000]  And once the war started, we immediately rushed $350 million in additional aid
[01:06.000 --> 01:08.000]  to further address their needs.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  On Saturday, my administration authorized another $200 million to keep a steady flow of weapons
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  and ammunition moving to Ukraine.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000]  I'm especially pleased to be able to announce today that the United States will provide
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  an additional $1 billion security assistance package for Ukraine.
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  Democrats demand $650 billion.
[01:33.000 --> 01:40.000]  See how it escalates? It's $60 something billion now, and now it's going to be $650 billion?
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Why not?
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.000]  And then you've got Mitt Romney and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden and all these people,
[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000]  Republican Democrat leaders who are warmongers, the neocons, whose families run the damn companies,
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  the media, the energy, the transportation, the shipyards, everything.
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.000]  The looting is incredible. And again, they're inflating the currency,
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  but they buy up real stuff as it's inflated, then they pass us the debt and the devaluation.
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  I mean, wow, that is a whopper.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  This is extremely, extremely dangerous situation that we are in right now.
[02:21.000 --> 02:26.000]  The good news is, all over the world, people are identifying the globalist plan
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  to collapse the economy by design in their own statements.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  What can we do together to avert a global food catastrophe?
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  To start, we have to understand the forces that have led us to this current precipice,
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  the most existential of which is climate change.
[02:47.000 --> 02:52.000]  The fact that they have put their politicians and controllers in, in every major government,
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  except for Congress, China and Russia.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau,
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  President of Argentina and so on, so that we penetrate the cabinets.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, bragged that they have control of half of the parliaments,
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  half of the cabinets, and governments of the world,
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  and that they're getting control of another 30-40%.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  They are close to having 80-90% control over governments in the world,
[03:22.000 --> 03:25.000]  and they brag they are the corporate global governance.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  We are making you sell your farms and taking your cows.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  How dare you riot in the Netherlands?
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Well, Dutch farmers now are getting angry every day more.
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  Government is not listening.
[03:42.000 --> 03:46.000]  And what we are fearing for is we have to leave our land.
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.000]  And that's also a deeper agenda behind it.
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  In Holland, they just want to have farmers' land.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  62% of the area in Holland is farmed by farmers.
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  And what they want to do is they want to have the land cheap,
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  so they're making it major first.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  And when they have the land in their hands, they can build houses on it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  Houses we don't need by Dutch citizens,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  because average Dutch couple is getting 1.8, 1.9 kids.
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  So there was the problem of the demand for houses
[04:20.000 --> 04:25.000]  that we get 100,000 refugees in this country every year.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  That's why they have to build houses.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  So you decide, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  do you want to roll over to this or do you want to get involved?
[04:32.000 --> 05:00.000]  It's time to realize we're entering the 12th round right now.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  Sold out for seven months.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  The body's ultimate turmeric formula is back in stock.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  Turmeric's been known for thousands of years

[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  your immune system for your libido.
[05:15.000 --> 05:20.000]  And look, the average type of the shelves is 5, 6, 7% curcuminoid.

[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today
[05:42.000 --> 05:47.000]  and ordering body's ultimate turmeric formula at mfullwarstore.com.

[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  at infowarstore.com today with body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[05:59.000 --> 06:27.000]  It's Wednesday, July 20th, 2022.
[06:27.000 --> 06:32.400]  And the sun isn't just setting on our republic, an iron curtain of incredible eco-turning
[06:32.400 --> 06:37.520]  descending, and freedom across the world is under attack with the very same criminal
[06:37.520 --> 06:40.520]  interest.
[06:40.520 --> 06:44.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for joining us for this historic broadcast.
[06:44.800 --> 06:50.400]  We're now the final pieces of what we have predicted are now falling into place.
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.600]  I'd love to give myself credit as if I'm a soothsayer or an oracle, but I'm not.
[06:56.600 --> 07:02.480]  I've just done my research, and we told you 31 months ago when the Great Reset began that
[07:02.480 --> 07:06.320]  would destroy supply chains by design, train you for lockdowns, and that next they would
[07:06.320 --> 07:12.320]  have climate lockdowns by cutting the energy off as the pretext to then tell you via your
[07:12.320 --> 07:17.880]  smartphone when you can use your car, when you can go to the store, when you can travel,
[07:17.880 --> 07:20.800]  when you can do anything in your life, including get medical care.
[07:20.800 --> 07:22.520]  Now how did I know all that?
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.360]  Because we have clips from 10 years ago, the World Economic Forum saying it, and 20 years
[07:27.360 --> 07:29.720]  ago from the Rockefeller Foundation.
[07:29.720 --> 07:36.640]  And we've watched them beta test it in places in Africa and Asia and Latin America, and
[07:36.640 --> 07:43.200]  now they're doing it in Europe, the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S.
[07:43.200 --> 07:44.200]  Turn the news on.
[07:44.200 --> 07:45.200]  You're going to eat bugs.
[07:45.200 --> 07:46.200]  There'll be no more beef.
[07:46.200 --> 07:47.200]  We're banning the cows.
[07:47.200 --> 07:48.200]  Like that'll never happen.
[07:48.200 --> 07:49.200]  It starts happening.
[07:49.200 --> 07:54.560]  And the meat-packing plants, a third of them blow up in flames, damn, start blowing up.
[07:54.560 --> 07:57.520]  This is the eco-globalist terror it's taking over.
[07:57.520 --> 08:00.640]  There are millions of believers saving the Earth from humans by destroying the carry
[08:00.640 --> 08:05.920]  capacity of the Earth for civilization, but those on top are technocrats actually getting
[08:05.920 --> 08:11.880]  rid of all of their competition and consolidating control for depopulation.
[08:11.880 --> 08:14.520]  We have now gone over the edge.
[08:14.520 --> 08:17.840]  They've introduced the legislation to make the presidency a dictatorship and use the
[08:17.840 --> 08:19.960]  military domestically against the public.
[08:19.960 --> 08:22.160]  That's already been passed in almost every other country in the world.
[08:22.160 --> 08:24.160]  It's the same globalist agenda.
[08:24.160 --> 08:31.800]  And now he's set at 1245 Central, we'll carry it live, Biden the puppet, the third administration
[08:31.800 --> 08:38.880]  of Obama, to declare the climate emergency.
[08:38.880 --> 08:42.320]  Now the Supreme Court showing you there's some internal battles inside the elite that
[08:42.320 --> 08:43.320]  run this country.
[08:43.320 --> 08:49.160]  Three weeks ago said, for the last 20 years, the EPA shutting down thousands of coal power
[08:49.160 --> 08:53.480]  plants in other facilities did not have law-making authority.
[08:53.480 --> 08:55.240]  You have to reverse that.
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.160]  And Biden said, I'm already planning a climate emergency by executive order.
[08:59.160 --> 09:01.360]  That means dictatorial order.
[09:01.360 --> 09:05.160]  And he said in a few weeks we'll make the announcement.
[09:05.160 --> 09:08.480]  He hasn't had the press conference yet.
[09:08.480 --> 09:16.040]  But I have right here, in my little pause, the document.
[09:16.040 --> 09:21.560]  Before the show, I only had time to read half of it.
[09:21.560 --> 09:24.280]  It just came out an hour ago.
[09:24.280 --> 09:34.120]  And it is devastating, the document, it's 50-something pages long, but when you go to
[09:34.120 --> 09:45.640]  page four, I just got a massive chill, when you read page four, baby, you know you're
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.040]  not in Kansas anymore and you're sure as hell not in the free planet.
[09:51.040 --> 09:54.200]  Stop all oil and gas drilling.
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.400]  Stop all energy exports.
[09:56.400 --> 10:00.720]  That alone will put us into a depression, the likes of which you've never seen.
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.320]  And they're just getting started.
[10:04.320 --> 10:13.320]  SEGs for the IMF and World Bank and a Rothschild Clinton Obama carbon consortium in London,
[10:13.320 --> 10:18.920]  the company's called Gore and Blood, I'm not joking, it's Al Gore and his partner, will
[10:18.920 --> 10:26.160]  track and regulate everything you do and control what you do in live time.
[10:26.160 --> 10:30.520]  And we'll decide what businesses are even allowed to operate.
[10:30.520 --> 10:36.720]  So this is the corporate elite world government takeover with their masses of leftists with
[10:36.720 --> 10:41.720]  maxed out credit cards and maxed out student debt and they all believe everything's really
[10:41.720 --> 10:43.800]  about to be free and it is going to be free.
[10:43.800 --> 10:47.680]  You're going to live in a dystopia, you're going to live in a 200-square-foot coffin
[10:47.680 --> 10:51.640]  apartment, you're going to be given force inoculations five, six times a year, you're
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.280]  going to be sterilized, you're going to be killed.
[10:58.280 --> 11:05.600]  Dictatorship didn't come in this time in Nazi uniforms and swastikas or Stalin up there
[11:05.600 --> 11:11.120]  at Red Square or Mao Zedong in Tiananmen Square.
[11:11.120 --> 11:16.240]  It's coming by just a crew of perverts and weirdos and control freaks who work for a
[11:16.240 --> 11:23.600]  scientific global dictatorship whose aim is 90% world population.
[11:23.600 --> 11:30.560]  The climate president's emergency powers, that's the front page of this, his emergency
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.680]  powers were in a climate emergency and all the old executive orders and all the martial
[11:35.680 --> 11:44.520]  law preparation we warned you about is cited in here and cited in the new NDAA legislation.
[11:44.520 --> 11:48.120]  They tried to pass last year as well, they're trying to pass this year to make the presidency
[11:48.120 --> 11:50.480]  a dictatorship with total domestic control.
[11:50.480 --> 11:59.160]  When you go to page four of this in the executive summary overhead shot, halt crude oil exports
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.600]  totally banned.
[12:03.600 --> 12:10.080]  Stop oil and gas drilling in the outer continental shelf, restrict international trade and private
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.160]  investment in fossil fuels, that's sanctions where you can't invest in it.
[12:15.160 --> 12:19.680]  Grow domestic manufacturing for clean energy and transportation to speed the nationwide
[12:19.680 --> 12:21.200]  transition off fossil fuels.
[12:21.200 --> 12:24.680]  They did this in Spain, they did this in Sri Lanka, they never transitioned.
[12:24.680 --> 12:30.640]  It's not designed, it collapses society, it's the carbon lockdown.
[12:30.640 --> 12:35.720]  Build resilient and distributed renewable energy systems.
[12:35.720 --> 12:45.200]  It goes into carbon taxes and regulations and SEGs, you've got to read this for yourself
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.260]  and they talk about how they're doing this to stop threats to the United States from
[12:48.260 --> 12:54.040]  rising sea levels which haven't risen, it's all a lie and they're in full court press
[12:54.040 --> 12:58.760]  showing fires around the world that always happen, it's part of the carbon cycle, showing
[12:58.760 --> 13:03.200]  storms that always happen, showing waves that always happen, showing hot temperatures saying
[13:03.200 --> 13:06.840]  it's the hottest Texas has ever been, the hottest England's ever been and none of it's
[13:06.840 --> 13:07.840]  even true.
[13:07.840 --> 13:12.200]  You can prove that in 10 seconds, we covered it yesterday with old newscasts showing it
[13:12.200 --> 13:19.480]  3, 4 degrees hotter in the UK, 3, 4 degrees hotter in the United States, it's all lies.
[13:19.480 --> 13:24.560]  And you know I love the listeners and I love other talk show hosts that are somewhat awake
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.560]  but you know even callers of the show and even commoners on Info Wars are like come
[13:29.560 --> 13:33.560]  on Alex, they're not going to make Biden a dictator, he's about to get removed, exactly
[13:33.560 --> 13:36.720]  it's the office becoming a dictatorship, oh they're not going to use the military
[13:36.720 --> 13:41.680]  domestically, come on and it's all right there, they're not going to do it like oh
[13:41.680 --> 13:45.160]  the military's a foreign enemy coming to get you, it's going to be oh there's not been
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.200]  power for weeks or months, oh everybody's starving, they're here to help, you got to
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.120]  go to the football stadium to get food and air conditioning or heat and I told you that
[13:54.120 --> 14:00.840]  years ago and now it's being announced because I have their battle plan and nothing is more
[14:00.840 --> 14:09.840]  frustrating than knowing this is all here, knowing that we're under it and knowing that
[14:09.840 --> 14:14.400]  if we just wake up and say no it's all over but even the Republican leadership is only
[14:14.400 --> 14:20.240]  chewing around the edges of this problem, the surveillance, the censorship, the collapsing
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.520]  borders, the pedophilia being promoted, the attacks on the family, the devaluation of
[14:24.520 --> 14:31.320]  the currencies, the bankrupting of the nation, coming after our guns, admitting they want
[14:31.320 --> 14:36.040]  to ban all semi-autos and then everything after that, it's here, the shipping into the
[14:36.040 --> 14:42.760]  fentanyl, we are under globalist thousand cut attack profile and I played Clips the
[14:42.760 --> 14:51.520]  WAAF yesterday saying we are going to bring this thing down by a hundred different options
[14:51.520 --> 14:58.640]  and a hundred different attacks, it's a transition, I played a bunch of clips yesterday of globalist
[14:58.640 --> 15:06.800]  saying we're doing this on purpose of transition, we got a bunch of new clips of Buddha judge
[15:06.800 --> 15:11.720]  in Congress admitting it's a transition and we're going to ban your gasoline car now by
[15:11.720 --> 15:17.320]  not letting you have fuel, this is siege and so out of one side of their mouth they blame
[15:17.320 --> 15:23.120]  gas stations and Putin while they're openly saying we're cutting off all the oil drilling,
[15:23.120 --> 15:29.360]  all the oil permits, all the oil exporting, it's over, we're isolating America, we're
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.240]  locking it down, this is total war and they put a bunch of dudes in dresses and gay dudes
[15:35.240 --> 15:39.480]  and all this up there so you don't take it serious and think they're a joke and while
[15:39.480 --> 15:44.600]  you're laughing at Biden falling down and while you're laughing at Buddha judge, they're
[15:44.600 --> 15:53.560]  killing us, it's camouflage, the dresses and all this crap, the top level psychological
[15:53.560 --> 15:59.600]  warfare experts came up with this, we'll be right back, stay with us.

[20:01.200 --> 20:17.360]  Feeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:17.360 --> 20:33.640]  I want everybody, including myself, to take three deep breaths and realize God's in control
[20:33.640 --> 20:40.360]  and God warned us this exact time in human development and history would come.
[20:40.360 --> 20:44.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we know the climate emergency we've already seen and implemented
[20:44.680 --> 20:49.960]  in more than 100 countries, it's a total shutdown and collapse of civilization and now the exact
[20:49.960 --> 20:54.280]  plan of the World Economic Forum and the United Nations, the corporations that control it
[20:54.280 --> 20:55.280]  is being implemented.
[20:55.280 --> 21:01.560]  Biden has already declared and signed the orders this morning and says he'll be signing
[21:01.560 --> 21:10.360]  more orders and in one hour and 25 minutes he is set to give a speech, an announcement
[21:10.360 --> 21:21.520]  of this, it is the total seizure of U.S. energy by private globalist banks, the shutdown of
[21:21.520 --> 21:28.600]  all their competition, the banning of all export of energy, our biggest export, the
[21:28.600 --> 21:39.080]  one thing we had left and the forced taxpayer funded movement to banning the combustion
[21:39.080 --> 21:43.840]  engine as California already did three months ago, so the legislation went through, first
[21:43.840 --> 21:48.960]  they're starting with small engines, leaf blowers, lawn mowers, Cushman and then it
[21:48.960 --> 21:53.680]  moves into cars and I have a Buddha judge in front of Congress or say, well get used
[21:53.680 --> 21:57.000]  to it, what's wrong with getting rid of your gas car because they don't have the energy
[21:57.000 --> 22:00.880]  capacity for the electric cars, they even use more carbon, not that that's a bad part
[22:00.880 --> 22:04.120]  of it and they don't work and they blow up and they're terrible and they're all made
[22:04.120 --> 22:11.360]  in China, the components, they had Spain do this 10 years ago and they'll never come
[22:11.360 --> 22:15.480]  out of it again, it's designed to bankrupt you forever and get rid of any small economy
[22:15.480 --> 22:21.920]  and they go what is effective, well small farms and ranches, ban those, ban small factories,
[22:21.920 --> 22:28.440]  ban small businesses, you've lived this in the last two and a half years and now they're
[22:28.440 --> 22:32.720]  going into the next phase, they said next phase is climate lockdowns as we shut the
[22:32.720 --> 22:36.640]  energy off and I'm like, they're going to shut the energy off next, the borders will
[22:36.640 --> 22:43.800]  collapse, the third world will flood us, it's replacement migration, it's a UN plan.
[22:43.800 --> 22:48.320]  I have a new announcement from the UN, not just of a partnership between the World Economic
[22:48.320 --> 22:54.360]  Forum and the UN, a joint level to have the corporations run the UN publicly, a new announcement
[22:54.360 --> 23:05.720]  by the Secretary General of the UN saying that we are implementing Agenda 2030 globally
[23:05.720 --> 23:06.880]  now.
[23:06.880 --> 23:12.000]  Now there are articles in the New York Times from 10 years ago, 5 years ago, a year ago
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.640]  saying I'm insane, Agenda 2030 does not exist but I have the UN announcing it and you're
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.520]  living under it.
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.640]  And their answer, when you say I don't want corporations cutting our energy off is to
[23:28.640 --> 23:33.720]  say you're an extremist, you're a white supremacist, we're going to talk about that with Roger
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.880]  Stone next segment, what just happened to him.
[23:36.880 --> 23:40.280]  But ladies and gentlemen, we have Roger Stone popping in, we have Mike Adams on the climate
[23:40.280 --> 23:44.240]  emergency, the takeover, Robert Barnes in the studio again, he'll be here in the next
[23:44.240 --> 23:50.360]  few weeks, Kate Dolly and so much other with Dr. Simone Gold, that is a jam packed broadcast
[23:50.360 --> 23:55.400]  today and then I'm going to open the phones up tomorrow, I've been doing a pretty good
[23:55.400 --> 24:00.360]  job of getting more calls, people really like that, I like that as well.
[24:00.360 --> 24:07.840]  But this is a new world order takeover, over a thousand cities and towns have Soros controlled
[24:07.840 --> 24:13.240]  district attorneys and county attorneys, 22 state attorney generals were publicly installed
[24:13.240 --> 24:18.720]  by him, I've got articles right here on infoawards.com, Soros gives financial backing to Beto O'Rourke
[24:18.720 --> 24:22.120]  gubernatorial campaign.
[24:22.120 --> 24:27.880]  This is a multinational takeover, the globalists have done this in countless other nations,
[24:27.880 --> 24:33.680]  now they're doing it here and cutting off the energy to bring us to our knees.
[24:33.680 --> 24:41.480]  There's an excellent movie came out in 2019, which is historically very accurate, called
[24:41.480 --> 24:52.000]  The King, set 600 years ago and it's the story of a new king and the government stages false
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.840]  flag assassination attempts on him so that they can have a war with France, which did
[24:56.840 --> 24:57.840]  happen.
[24:57.840 --> 25:02.000]  And after he found out about that later, he executed his leadership, because he was so
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.800]  pissed about it, but that's not the issue about the movie The King, it's not the same
[25:06.800 --> 25:14.380]  actor that's in Dune, it's that it shows the first thing they do when they invade France
[25:14.380 --> 25:20.640]  is lay siege to the coastal castles to make them give up so they can control the supply
[25:20.640 --> 25:27.440]  chain so they can control the whole country, that's the historic thing they did.
[25:27.440 --> 25:35.560]  So they knew this 2,000 years ago, 500 years ago, what you do is you take control of the
[25:35.560 --> 25:38.800]  food and the energy.
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.960]  And once you've done that, you dictate to your enemies their surrender.
[25:43.960 --> 25:51.480]  This is 101 warfare, I mentioned The King because I hadn't seen it and it's a good movie,
[25:51.480 --> 25:56.760]  I watched it, it was a Sunday night and I'd read the history of it, damn this is a really
[25:56.760 --> 25:57.920]  good movie.
[25:57.920 --> 26:04.800]  But the point is you see what was happening 600 years ago and you see how it's the exact
[26:04.800 --> 26:10.400]  same thing happening today, this was a high-tech version of it, and where are the governors?
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.400]  Where is the leadership?
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.920]  I mean DeSantis is halfway there, Trump's halfway there, but they should be everywhere,
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.200]  not oh, Biden's wrong, the sea levels aren't rising, Biden's just dumb with his stupid
[26:21.200 --> 26:25.400]  environmental stuff, he ain't dumb, they're seizing control of US energy and shutting
[26:25.400 --> 26:31.240]  us down and bankrupting the hell out of us, it's total war.
[26:31.240 --> 26:38.040]  The Republicans love to laugh at the head of nuclear waste, who wears a dress to work,
[26:38.040 --> 26:45.080]  they do that on purpose to manipulate you, they're clowns, to clown you.
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.560]  When the archetypal joker blows up the police station, he ain't wearing a clown outfit because
[26:49.560 --> 26:55.320]  he's a clown, he's saying you're a clown.
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.920]  Buddha judge didn't a clown, none of these people are clowns, they're hardcore psychotics
[27:00.920 --> 27:07.160]  with a worldwide takeover plan, and they learn that they wear sharp, Hugo Boss, finely tailored
[27:07.160 --> 27:15.640]  badass uniforms and have armies of troops dressed in black, people recognize that as
[27:15.640 --> 27:22.440]  evil and oppressive and threatening, so the behavioral psychologist said dress up like
[27:22.440 --> 27:27.960]  women, just like a man when he kidnaps children will dress like a woman, how is the thousand
[27:27.960 --> 27:31.920]  year old story, I think it's more than a thousand, it's so ancient they found carvings
[27:31.920 --> 27:37.960]  on church walls over 1200 years old in places like France about the big bad wolf.
[27:37.960 --> 27:43.600]  And what does mommy teach, their little cute 9, 10 year old daughter, when she starts going
[27:43.600 --> 27:48.360]  to draw water, going to the local town to bring something there for dad or mom, when
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.400]  you go to town sweetheart, when you walk a few miles, you may see somebody dressed like
[27:53.400 --> 27:58.760]  grandma or dressed like a woman or someone that looks not threatening but they want to
[27:58.760 --> 28:08.680]  kill you, the wolf is the man, dressed as the woman, and when you see men dressed like
[28:08.680 --> 28:17.280]  women wanting access to your children, that's 101 psychotic serial killers, sounds the lambs
[28:17.280 --> 28:21.720]  based on a lot of real composites of psychopaths and real cases that happened that they combined
[28:21.720 --> 28:26.360]  into one movie, who is the man of the main serial killer, he's a guy that says he's
[28:26.360 --> 28:36.240]  a woman, they know exactly what they're doing, this is an exact attack profile, they're not
[28:36.240 --> 28:43.520]  women, they're not men that want to be women, they're hardcore psychotic demons, and when
[28:43.520 --> 28:50.160]  they pull the wigs off, they're the equivalent of vampires, got it, they think you're weak
[28:50.160 --> 28:55.000]  and stupid and they're trance watching Netflix, they're coming for you, that's for me, I've
[28:55.000 --> 29:01.280]  decided no surrender and we're fighting to the end.
[29:01.280 --> 29:06.440]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.160]  annihilate the family, to split up marriages, and if you look at the studies, the number
[29:11.160 --> 29:17.920]  one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in
[29:17.920 --> 29:22.560]  the bedroom, it's that simple ladies and gentlemen, and even if you're like me and hardly ever
[29:22.560 --> 29:26.880]  have a problem, I mean all of us one for another too, that's just the truth, the liberals will
[29:26.880 --> 29:30.200]  make fun of that but everybody knows that's true, but whether you rarely have any issues
[29:30.200 --> 29:35.560]  or have them on a regular basis, InstaHard is the number one best selling natural herbal

[30:11.680 --> 30:13.560]  a toxic way.
[30:13.560 --> 30:18.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways

[30:26.320 --> 30:29.600]  by turning up your metabolism.

[30:56.960 --> 30:57.960]  great for me.
[30:57.960 --> 31:03.240]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[31:03.240 --> 31:07.800]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less, but I've got to tell you, InfoWarZ is only
[31:07.800 --> 31:12.440]  about bringing you amazing products that really work, so we looked at the supplement market
[31:12.440 --> 31:18.160]  that we fund a lot of our operations with and we said, what are the best selling, natural,
[31:18.160 --> 31:21.320]  healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[31:21.320 --> 31:26.520]  We went and looked at the top 10 and they all had the same ingredients in common that
[31:26.520 --> 31:34.080]  is in this product, but with our new product from X7, DietForge, we got the very best concentrates
[31:34.080 --> 31:40.600]  of these known natural essences that just do amazing things for your body, and so I've
[31:40.600 --> 31:44.720]  lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three months and I've
[31:44.720 --> 31:48.480]  been doing it using DietForge and also Exercise.
[31:48.480 --> 31:55.080]  Well now DietForge is exclusively available right now at InfoWarStore.com, 40% off.

[31:59.960 --> 32:05.080]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[32:05.080 --> 32:10.280]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government
[32:10.280 --> 32:16.780]  agencies and now they have produced specifically for us this Made in America onion line at

[32:41.560 --> 32:42.560]  at InfoWarStore.com.

[32:48.760 --> 32:52.960]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[32:52.960 --> 32:57.440]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at InfoWars
[32:57.440 --> 33:01.440]  Store.com.
[33:01.440 --> 33:27.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:27.360 --> 33:35.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance, live from the InfoWars.com
[33:35.040 --> 33:40.040]  studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:40.040 --> 33:51.080]  All right, in hour number two, one of the top experts in the globalist takeover, Mike
[33:51.080 --> 33:55.120]  Adams is joining us to deal with the climate emergency powers.
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.960]  He declared this morning in this document an executive order by Biden, he set coming
[33:59.960 --> 34:04.440]  up in about an hour and 15 minutes from now to do a press conference or not a press conference
[34:04.440 --> 34:07.200]  of speech where the puppet will lay all this out.
[34:07.200 --> 34:09.520]  This is the seizure of all U.S. energy.
[34:09.520 --> 34:12.960]  It actually states in the document, I showed it to you at the start of the show, I'm even
[34:12.960 --> 34:19.240]  shocked by how bold and out in the opening it is, it ties in to the legislation sponsored
[34:19.240 --> 34:26.000]  by SHIFHR4350 to make him a dictator domestically over the military with no oversight, and again,
[34:26.000 --> 34:30.400]  this is bigger than Biden, this passes to all presidents if it's passed until it is repealed,
[34:30.400 --> 34:31.400]  that's coming up.
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.680]  But I wanted to get Roger on because I saw headlines all over the nation that he's a
[34:36.680 --> 34:39.720]  white supremacist, and they're doing the same thing to me.
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.640]  So this is bigger than Roger Stone and Alex Jones, I want to illustrate the next phase
[34:43.640 --> 34:44.640]  of their plan.
[34:44.640 --> 34:51.800]  We're going to talk about that here in just a moment and get into this whole power grab
[34:51.800 --> 34:56.520]  and one of the Republican leadership is doing almost nothing with Roger Stone here in just
[34:56.520 --> 34:57.520]  a moment.
[34:57.520 --> 35:02.600]  But first, we are on the edge of not being able to run this operation despite big donations,
[35:02.600 --> 35:06.320]  we were so far behind, we had so many issues, but because of the help we got in the last
[35:06.320 --> 35:12.240]  three months, we were able to get new top suppliers, and we have 15 of our products
[35:12.240 --> 35:17.360]  that have been sold out on average eight to 10 months coming back in.
[35:17.360 --> 35:21.960]  Bodies ultimate turmeric formula came in, we have a year in development, plus the amazing
[35:21.960 --> 35:26.320]  natural fat burner diet force came in, that's selling very well, so currently we're getting
[35:26.320 --> 35:29.280]  back in the black if this continues.
[35:29.280 --> 35:32.760]  The number one overall biggest seller, not profit margins, we don't make a lot of money
[35:32.760 --> 35:37.000]  on it but it's a great product, number one per unit seller is Vitamin Rolfusion sold
[35:37.000 --> 35:38.880]  out for more than six months.
[35:38.880 --> 35:43.800]  Big shipment comes in next week, the FDA testing is happening today, that's we triple
[35:43.800 --> 35:47.560]  tested, we have the high standards, and then it will ship from the factory in the US, it
[35:47.560 --> 35:51.920]  will be on sale on Monday, that will really help us.
[35:51.920 --> 35:55.960]  But right now, we have Alex's war exclusively available on DVD, so it's in your archives,
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.760]  they can't censor it, it'll ship on the 29th, you can pre-order it right now, it's number
[35:59.760 --> 36:04.240]  two on Apple sales charts, again we don't make any money off that but off the DVD we
[36:04.240 --> 36:08.240]  do make some money, so please go to m4score.com.
[36:08.240 --> 36:12.240]  Also get the new powerful weight loss formula, it's all natural with no concentrated extracts
[36:12.240 --> 36:22.800]  and compounds that turn up your entire metabolic system so that you basically burn more calories
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.080]  naturally in a healthy way, so turn up your metabolism in a healthy way, it's an amazing
[36:27.080 --> 36:33.280]  product, it's also a great energy product, but dietforce at m4score.com, that is 40%
[36:33.280 --> 36:36.760]  off, body's ultimate turmeric formula sold out for almost eight months, highest quality
[36:36.760 --> 36:41.040]  that there is out there 95% of humanoid, that's the active ingredient that kills inflammation,
[36:41.040 --> 36:47.040]  antioxidants, so good of your immune system, it's 25% off and so much more at m4score.com.
[36:47.040 --> 36:50.240]  Thank you for keeping us in the fight at such a critical point, we were supposed to already
[36:50.240 --> 36:53.520]  be off the air by now but we are not.
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.040]  Alright, I talked about this some yesterday and it's such a big deal because if they had
[36:58.040 --> 37:05.720]  met on CNN and MSNBC, that it is the model for Tucker Carlson Fox News and any other
[37:05.720 --> 37:12.720]  populist groups that are out there, we showed you the judge's ruling that she affirmed last
[37:12.720 --> 37:20.880]  Friday in a hearing, a month and a half ago the Democrat Party Soros funded judge said,
[37:20.880 --> 37:26.680]  you may not mention the First Amendment or that you're innocent or this is a show trial
[37:26.680 --> 37:30.800]  and we're already guilty, she's ruled, defaulting us, unprecedented, so a jury will decide how
[37:30.800 --> 37:34.480]  guilty we are and basically we have to sit there and not talk and it's going to be on
[37:34.480 --> 37:39.360]  national TV, 18 networks, 18 groups have filed to carry it live, when I checked a few weeks
[37:39.360 --> 37:44.160]  ago it's probably 30 or 40 now, just at the pre-trial deal there was 30-something media
[37:44.160 --> 37:46.040]  there.
[37:46.040 --> 37:49.960]  They have ruled that we can't talk and they've said they're going to have white supremacist
[37:49.960 --> 37:53.600]  experts, what's that have to do with Sandy Hook and me questioning it, they're anti-Connecticut
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.800]  they've ruled the same experts and they say, Alex Jones is a white supremacist and we
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.760]  cannot respond, we said we have footage of me protesting the KKK, all these statements
[38:02.760 --> 38:08.240]  they said no, those cannot be shown, you may not respond while we say you're KKK.
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.680]  Our listeners know that's a lie but folks this isn't just a show trial, this is just
[38:11.680 --> 38:16.000]  a rigged trial, I have the actual rulings right here and we'll cover it when Robert
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.160]  Barnes is on with his third hour, a press release is going to come out today in the
[38:19.160 --> 38:25.160]  next 30 minutes at infowars.com that affects everybody, but this formula is incredible,
[38:25.160 --> 38:29.120]  the reawakened American tourism going on for over a year, it gets up to 20,000 people
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.720]  at it, I went to one in San Antonio with 10,000 people, six months ago standing room
[38:33.720 --> 38:39.000]  only with General Flynn and it's black people, Hispanics, whites, old, they're like a tent
[38:39.000 --> 38:42.840]  revival hugging each other, loving each other, I would say black folks are over represented
[38:42.840 --> 38:47.960]  which is great as the speakers, they're amazing, so many incredible people, they were going
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.600]  to have a big event in California, the liberals called it white supremacist, put a picture
[38:52.600 --> 38:58.120]  of Roger Stone who headed up Trump's outreach to black folks in the 2016 campaign because
[38:58.120 --> 39:03.480]  he was trying to get prison reform which the left's gone too far from but that's how liberal
[39:03.480 --> 39:07.680]  Roger Stone is in many ways compared to the average Republican, if you have a criticism
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.320]  it might be that, I'm not criticizing him, I don't want non-violent offenders in jail,
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.640]  but the idea that he is a white supremacist is pure defamation, he doesn't have the money,
[39:16.640 --> 39:21.000]  I don't have the money for lawsuits, so he's a white supremacist, I'm a white supremacist,
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.880]  everybody's a white supremacist but the democratic party, venue cancels pro-Trump tour featuring
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.640]  Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, huge picture of Roger Stone, after a community petition warned
[39:30.640 --> 39:35.280]  it could attract white supremacist Yahoo News, other headlines just said it's a white supremacist
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.640]  event, New York Trump event canceled, so in New York, California everywhere, over fears
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.520]  of white supremacist, New York's the main one, venue cancels pro-Trump tour featuring
[39:45.520 --> 39:49.560]  Michael Flynn, Roger Stone for community petition warns it's white supremacist, so it's happening
[39:49.560 --> 39:53.080]  in New York, it's happening in California, it's happening all over the place because
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.040]  the left says you're a white supremacist, here's some of the headlines on me, Judge
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.880]  orders Alex Jones to pay $1 million fine in fees of Sandy Hook parents before I'm even
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.640]  found guilty, all the articles about how they're going to say I'm a white supremacist, and
[40:06.640 --> 40:12.840]  oh Alex begs the court not to say I'm a white supremacist, imagine the rigging of this,
[40:12.840 --> 40:17.440]  Roger I'm ranting, I've introduced all this here, here it is, denied, court refuses Alex
[40:17.440 --> 40:21.320]  Jones request to deny paying $1 million, oh that's the other one, Alex Jones lawyers
[40:21.320 --> 40:24.840]  want to bar all mentioned of white supremacy and extremists from his trial with Sandy Hook
[40:24.840 --> 40:29.320]  families, business insider, no they don't want to bar it, they have experts saying I'm a
[40:29.320 --> 40:35.880]  white supremacist, and then I'm not allowed to respond, the judge said, so Roger we see
[40:35.880 --> 40:41.000]  their blueprint in the future, not just de-platform, not just not let us speak in public, but literally
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.960]  take all the money we have or put us in prison by calling us white supremacist, this is next
[40:44.960 --> 40:48.280]  level Roger, and I know it's got to piss you off.
[40:48.280 --> 40:54.720]  Yeah, Alex it is somewhat aggravating, but this is the new tactic, call anyone you disagree,
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.920]  whether it's Tucker Carlson or General Michael Flynn or Alex Jones or Roger Stone, a white
[41:00.920 --> 41:07.720]  supremacist, particularly the two worst offenders, the business insider, folks let's be very
[41:07.720 --> 41:13.760]  clear, they're not about business and they're not insiders, they're also not journalists,
[41:13.760 --> 41:19.320]  they're haters, they're distortionists, two stories in a row insisting that I am a white
[41:19.320 --> 41:27.360]  supremacist, Alex I have a 30 year record of opposing the racist war on drugs, the war
[41:27.360 --> 41:33.160]  on drugs as originally started under President Richard Nixon was focused on drug traffickers
[41:33.160 --> 41:39.920]  and drug dealers, it was Senate Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden and President Bill Clinton
[41:39.920 --> 41:46.000]  who mandated the harsh mandatory penalties for the first time nonviolent crime of possession
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.640]  of small amounts of drugs that has fallen disproportionately on black people, yes I'm
[41:51.640 --> 41:56.840]  sorry I have been a 30 year critic, I have marched against the war on drugs, I have written
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.440]  about it, I have given speeches about it, I supported the two presidents who have done
[42:02.440 --> 42:08.880]  more for black people than any presidents in my history, Richard Nixon who desegregated
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.240]  the public schools, not Lyndon Johnson, not John F. Kennedy, but Richard Nixon, I also
[42:15.240 --> 42:21.120]  gave us affirmative action, I support affirmative action, a lot of conservatives vociferously
[42:21.120 --> 42:22.640]  criticize me for that.
[42:22.640 --> 42:27.560]  That's right, read about it, it knows Roger Stone's pedigree, you are extremely liberal
[42:27.560 --> 42:32.000]  and super pro black, that's why this is so outrageous, the black community loves you,
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  but this is so desperate and so criminal in my view, banning you, being able to speak
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.880]  because they're calling you a white supremacist.
[42:39.880 --> 42:44.560]  It's a smear, it's a communist tactic, but it's the one we must get used to, and it has
[42:44.560 --> 42:51.000]  to be rebutted, as soon as it rears its ugly head, that's exactly what we are doing here
[42:51.000 --> 42:54.000]  today, white supremacist my ass.
[42:54.000 --> 43:00.360]  God, that's unbelievable, say what, let's go right back Roger.

[45:13.760 --> 45:18.600]  other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like infowars.com
[45:18.600 --> 45:21.520]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[45:21.520 --> 45:24.800]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[45:24.800 --> 45:28.520]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[45:28.520 --> 45:32.280]  All these shirts are limited edition, they are about to be history and will only exist
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.680]  in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.560]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left and a couple weeks they'll all
[45:39.560 --> 45:40.920]  be gone and they'll be history.
[45:40.920 --> 45:47.800]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com so thank you all for your support, please

[45:59.760 --> 46:03.720]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[46:03.720 --> 46:05.600]  you gain weight even if you eat a lot less.
[46:05.600 --> 46:11.080]  But I got to tell you, info wars is only about bringing you amazing products that really
[46:11.080 --> 46:12.080]  work.
[46:12.080 --> 46:14.760]  So, we looked at the supplement market that we find a lot of our operations with and
[46:14.760 --> 46:21.240]  we said, what are the best selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that
[46:21.240 --> 46:22.240]  are out there?
[46:22.240 --> 46:27.040]  We went and looked at the top 10, they all had the same ingredients in common that is
[46:27.040 --> 46:28.040]  in this product.
[46:28.040 --> 46:35.520]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these
[46:35.520 --> 46:40.400]  known natural essences that's two amazing things for your body.
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.680]  And so, I've lost almost 40 pounds, I'm so a little bit overweight, in the last three
[46:44.680 --> 46:48.560]  months and I've been doing it using diet force and also exercise.
[46:48.560 --> 46:57.200]  Well, now diet force is exclusively available right now at infowarstore.com, 40% off, infowarstore.com,

[47:01.000 --> 47:06.840]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.720]  I want to get the 35,000 foot view or the 10 mile view, if you will as well.
[47:50.720 --> 47:54.360]  What would you call this period of time with Biden announcing a climate emergency?
[47:54.360 --> 47:58.880]  I've got the document right here saying they're going to seize control, no more oil exports,
[47:58.880 --> 47:59.880]  no more oil drilling here.
[47:59.880 --> 48:01.520]  This will kill the economy.
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.320]  The Buddha just says, yeah, we're going to ban your gas cars, meanwhile they blame Russia
[48:06.320 --> 48:09.280]  and gas stations for what's happening.
[48:09.280 --> 48:13.100]  And the Democratic Party and all the polls is committing suicide, but their clear answer
[48:13.100 --> 48:18.120]  is dictatorship over energy, dictatorship over the military in all this legislation.
[48:18.120 --> 48:22.040]  And then we're not hearing almost anything out of the Republican leadership on this other
[48:22.040 --> 48:23.440]  than Tucker Carlson.
[48:23.440 --> 48:25.680]  What do you make of this?
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.040]  First one housekeeping thing, Alex, and then I will answer your question.
[48:29.040 --> 48:36.040]  The reawaken America tour for Rochester, New York, August 12th and 13th has not been cancelled.
[48:36.040 --> 48:37.240]  Not been cancelled.
[48:37.240 --> 48:39.480]  It is moving to a new venue.
[48:39.480 --> 48:42.120]  These claims of white supremacy are baseless.
[48:42.120 --> 48:43.880]  It's a smear tactic.
[48:43.880 --> 48:47.200]  You can go to ThriveTimeShow.com and still get tickets.
[48:47.200 --> 48:51.400]  We will not be intimidated by smear tactics.
[48:51.400 --> 48:54.280]  Now Alex, let me address that question.
[48:54.280 --> 49:00.240]  This is not as if these are misguided liberal policies and that they really don't understand
[49:00.240 --> 49:05.400]  that turning off the Keystone Pipeline or opening our southern border is going to have
[49:05.400 --> 49:06.600]  a negative effect.
[49:06.600 --> 49:10.160]  This is extraordinarily purposeful.
[49:10.160 --> 49:12.440]  It's completely purposeful.
[49:12.440 --> 49:18.480]  They seek nothing less than the complete destruction of this country.
[49:18.480 --> 49:24.200]  And now because they fear that they're about to lose the midterm elections, they are moving
[49:24.200 --> 49:31.600]  ahead aggressively with executive orders to seize power and to try to expedite this destruction
[49:31.600 --> 49:36.080]  of the country on every front, on every front.
[49:36.080 --> 49:38.720]  It really is astounding to be living through this.
[49:38.720 --> 49:40.280]  You've been involved in politics 50 years.
[49:40.280 --> 49:41.760]  I've been involved 28 years.
[49:41.760 --> 49:44.280]  Have you ever seen anything like this?
[49:44.280 --> 49:50.240]  No, I've never seen this level of the Democrat media coordination.
[49:50.240 --> 49:53.680]  I mean, they are completely in it together.
[49:53.680 --> 49:57.360]  And they censor us and they censor us on top of it.
[49:57.360 --> 50:02.200]  It's the first time in American history that all mass communications, whether it's network
[50:02.200 --> 50:08.040]  television, cable television, corporate radio, which as you know is slowly squeezing out
[50:08.040 --> 50:13.120]  the mom and pops, all print media, whether it's newspapers, magazines, and of course
[50:13.120 --> 50:18.200]  the internet, it's why the survival of info wars is so vitally important.
[50:18.200 --> 50:22.520]  I remember you telling me a couple of weeks ago how much trouble you were having getting
[50:22.520 --> 50:25.520]  very, very high quality turmeric.
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.000]  The news that bodies will be available again.
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.360]  This is extraordinarily good news, folks.
[50:30.360 --> 50:32.040]  This is a great product.
[50:32.040 --> 50:33.040]  I use it.
[50:33.040 --> 50:34.040]  My wife use it.
[50:34.040 --> 50:36.680]  My son, who's a police officer, uses it.
[50:36.680 --> 50:40.240]  You can't get turmeric like this anyplace else.
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.440]  So that was very good news, Alex.
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.440]  Very good news indeed.
[50:43.440 --> 50:50.080]  Well, as you know, we're all under total attack and tyrants are very good at easing us into
[50:50.080 --> 50:51.080]  the hot waters.
[50:51.080 --> 50:54.880]  We don't notice we're boiling to death, but we're really at that point.
[50:54.880 --> 50:56.480]  Look at your crystal ball.
[50:56.480 --> 51:00.920]  Biden's collapsing and talking about replacing him, we're 111 days out from the midterms.
[51:00.920 --> 51:02.800]  What do you think they're going to pull next and how do we counter them?
[51:02.800 --> 51:05.040]  How do we stop them?
[51:05.040 --> 51:08.640]  You know, I think the fact that we're reading more and more about the contents of Hunter
[51:08.640 --> 51:14.360]  Biden's laptop and that that is now bled over into mainstream media coverage means that
[51:14.360 --> 51:15.960]  his days are numbered.
[51:15.960 --> 51:20.560]  The left has determined that his usefulness is over.
[51:20.560 --> 51:26.280]  I suggest that they will remove him either before or most likely immediately after the
[51:26.280 --> 51:29.760]  midterm election under the 25th Amendment.
[51:29.760 --> 51:35.760]  He will leave willingly on the condition that he can pardon his son and his brother on his
[51:35.760 --> 51:37.440]  way out the door.
[51:37.440 --> 51:41.840]  They've been involved in massive corruption as well as treason.
[51:41.840 --> 51:45.280]  And I think you're going to see a complete reshuffle of the deck.
[51:45.280 --> 51:49.720]  That would mean technically Kamala Harris moves up to be president.
[51:49.720 --> 51:55.400]  She would be allowed to appoint a vice president, but that vice president would require confirmation
[51:55.400 --> 51:59.240]  not just from the Senate, but from the Senate and the House.
[51:59.240 --> 52:05.280]  And the word is, Gavin Newsom, obviously we've been seeing a lot of scuttlebutt about that.
[52:05.280 --> 52:07.000]  She's going to met with all the top donors.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.160]  Even the New York Times has said they're preparing her.
[52:09.160 --> 52:13.320]  Who do you think she would tap to be the vice president because obviously then they'll remove
[52:13.320 --> 52:15.480]  her and put that person in?
[52:15.480 --> 52:18.920]  I'm still, I still side with my friend Joel Gilbert.
[52:18.920 --> 52:23.160]  I still believe that Michelle Obama is where they're going to pin their hopes.
[52:23.160 --> 52:26.480]  Hillary Clinton would like very much to step into the scene.
[52:26.480 --> 52:29.160]  John Durham is about to take care of that.
[52:29.160 --> 52:32.640]  I'm not saying that Durham is going to charge Hillary Clinton.
[52:32.640 --> 52:33.640]  He's not.
[52:33.640 --> 52:39.560]  He's going to conclude in her report that she and her friends committed egregious crimes,
[52:39.560 --> 52:43.400]  but they're time barred by the statute of limitations from.
[52:43.400 --> 52:47.800]  So he's going to scuttle Hillary and then help Obama, who's really the president, continue
[52:47.800 --> 52:52.080]  on through his new puppet, Michael Obama.
[52:52.080 --> 52:53.800]  This is exactly the plan.
[52:53.800 --> 52:58.480]  People lose sight of the fact that the Obamas hate the Clintons perhaps almost as much as
[52:58.480 --> 52:59.480]  we do.
[52:59.480 --> 53:05.520]  And they want her off the stage because she and her husband have become a major embarrassment.
[53:05.520 --> 53:10.960]  So unfortunately, I'm afraid Mr. Durham here is going to do the handiwork of the globalists
[53:10.960 --> 53:18.600]  by conveniently getting Hillary out of the way and that paves the way for a for a Michelle
[53:18.600 --> 53:20.000]  Obama rise.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.160]  The Democratic ticket in 2024 will be Michelle Obama and Pete Buttigieg.
[53:26.160 --> 53:32.520]  That covers the two largest and most important constituencies in the modern Democratic Party.
[53:32.520 --> 53:33.520]  You heard it here first.
[53:33.520 --> 53:38.880]  Hi, Roger, you were on with us on Friday, July 1st, and I said, I've talked to members
[53:38.880 --> 53:42.040]  of Congress and talked to Trump recently, he's planning on running in the next few months.
[53:42.040 --> 53:46.160]  He said, yeah, maybe even as early as July 4th, but it looks like July.
[53:46.160 --> 53:50.680]  Then on July 15th, he said, yes, I'm running, I just haven't decided when to announce it.
[53:50.680 --> 53:54.600]  So that was a Trump announcement right there.
[53:54.600 --> 53:56.600]  What's the latest scuttle butt on that?
[53:56.600 --> 54:02.120]  Well, the most important thing to remember about Donald Trump, the most predictable thing
[54:02.120 --> 54:05.040]  is that he's completely unpredictable.
[54:05.040 --> 54:08.240]  I am still absolutely convinced that he is running.
[54:08.240 --> 54:14.160]  I think he has a little greater flexibility based on the release of a memo today by Attorney
[54:14.160 --> 54:19.080]  General Merrick Garland, who essentially seems to be telegraphing that there'll be no indictment
[54:19.080 --> 54:23.960]  of Donald Trump before the election, before the election.
[54:23.960 --> 54:29.640]  Doesn't mean they won't try to charge him with some fabricated crime regarding January.
[54:29.640 --> 54:33.960]  But couldn't that be a faint so that he doesn't announce?
[54:33.960 --> 54:34.960]  It could be.
[54:34.960 --> 54:40.960]  Look, I think that there's a lot of arguments for not announcing before this November.
[54:40.960 --> 54:45.960]  First of all, sustaining a presidential campaign for 18 months, extremely difficult.
[54:45.960 --> 54:50.120]  If the party falls short this fall, which they're going to, meaning it's not that I
[54:50.120 --> 54:55.080]  don't think we will win, but I don't think we will win by the massive margins being currently
[54:55.080 --> 54:56.080]  predicted.
[54:56.080 --> 54:58.760]  Because of the fraudulent sea wall of election fraud.
[54:58.760 --> 54:59.760]  Exactly.
[54:59.760 --> 55:01.600]  Then they would blame that on Trump.
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.400]  There are also a number of legal obstacles.
[55:04.400 --> 55:06.240]  The good news is he's running.
[55:06.240 --> 55:08.960]  The only question is when he chooses to announce it.
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.640]  And I think he is, in fact, undecided on that point right now.
[55:12.640 --> 55:17.960]  Personally, I hope he waits until immediately after the midterms, because he would also
[55:17.960 --> 55:24.240]  be accused of distracting money and attention to the many good candidates and some bad candidates
[55:24.240 --> 55:27.600]  who are on the ballot as Republicans this fall.
[55:27.600 --> 55:32.360]  But Roger, you saying that from here until look like July that he would say he was running,
[55:32.360 --> 55:35.960]  he did say last week, yeah, I'm going to run, have decided to win.
[55:35.960 --> 55:37.560]  So that really is an announcement.
[55:37.560 --> 55:40.560]  And so that's tomorrow's news today that verifies what you said.
[55:40.560 --> 55:43.000]  Yeah, look, I think we were correct.
[55:43.000 --> 55:46.520]  We were both speculating that it might be July 4th.
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.520]  That would have been a publicly relations tour de force.
[55:50.520 --> 55:52.720]  We didn't say it flatly that it would be.
[55:52.720 --> 55:53.720]  But I agree with you.
[55:53.720 --> 55:58.480]  If you go back and look what he said the second week of July, I think our information was
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.480]  correct.
[55:59.480 --> 56:04.160]  And again, is I do believe he's running, I do believe he's our strongest candidate.
[56:04.160 --> 56:10.960]  I do believe, I think it was Kim Clement, the famous prophet who said he would serve
[56:10.960 --> 56:11.960]  two terms.
[56:11.960 --> 56:14.560]  I still believe he will serve two terms.
[56:14.560 --> 56:15.560]  All right.

[56:34.960 --> 56:36.080]  Thank you, Alex.
[56:36.080 --> 56:39.600]  As far as the white supremacy crap, I think we've disposed of that.
[56:39.600 --> 56:41.080]  You're not a white supremacist.
[56:41.080 --> 56:42.080]  I'm not.
[56:42.080 --> 56:43.080]  And we don't support them.
[56:43.080 --> 56:45.120]  I am a human supremacist.
[56:45.120 --> 56:47.360]  Thank you so much, Roger.
[56:47.360 --> 56:49.440]  I believe in the nuclear family supremacy.
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.440]  I believe in God's supremacy.
[56:50.440 --> 56:51.960]  We're going to go to break.
[56:51.960 --> 56:52.960]  Thank you, Roger Stone.
[56:52.960 --> 56:56.600]  We're going to come back with a special report that we haven't aired yet and then Mike Adams
[56:56.600 --> 57:01.360]  on this climate dictatorship being announced and the attempt to just wreck the economy
[57:01.360 --> 57:06.240]  even further to bring us to our knees for the great reset that's coming up next hour.
[57:06.240 --> 57:07.640]  Please don't forget.
[57:07.640 --> 57:08.920]  You can pre-order right now.
[57:08.920 --> 57:13.800]  It ships the 29th, Alex's War, a third-party documentary that is incredibly well done,
[57:13.800 --> 57:18.080]  already number two on Apple, a film for people that want to see it there.
[57:18.080 --> 57:21.840]  I don't make any money off that, but it does fund the operation when you get the film,
[57:21.840 --> 57:26.800]  discount other films as well, like 2000mules at infowarstore.com, have it in your library
[57:26.800 --> 57:30.240]  so they can't censor it as easily as you can show it to friends and family.
[57:30.240 --> 57:35.960]  And back at stock, ultimate turmeric formula, the highest level, cacuminoid, so good for
[57:35.960 --> 57:38.400]  your whole body, your joints, your immune system and more.

[57:44.240 --> 57:51.200]  weight loss, turn up your metabolism, it has a lot of energy as well, diet force.
[57:51.200 --> 57:56.360]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships,
[57:56.360 --> 57:58.800]  to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[57:58.800 --> 58:04.200]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the
[58:04.200 --> 58:08.720]  fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[58:08.720 --> 58:10.400]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.320]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for
[58:14.320 --> 58:16.200]  another, do, that's just the truth.
[58:16.200 --> 58:18.600]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[58:54.200 --> 58:58.720]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[58:58.720 --> 58:59.720]  profiles.
[58:59.720 --> 59:00.720]  You see it every year.
[59:00.720 --> 59:05.640]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[59:05.640 --> 59:10.520]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax
[59:10.520 --> 59:14.400]  groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public under
[59:14.400 --> 59:15.760]  understanding this and knowing this.
[59:15.760 --> 59:21.440]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[59:21.440 --> 59:26.760]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful, that allows you to keep more of
[59:26.760 --> 59:27.760]  your money.
[59:27.760 --> 59:32.440]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[59:32.440 --> 59:39.520]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[59:39.520 --> 59:46.520]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:31.480]  Tomorrow President Obama unveils tough new regulations to combat climate change and unprecedented
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:33.360]  cuts on carbon pollution.
[1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:37.520]  At the heart of his plan coal power plants, if somebody wants to build a coal power plant
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:42.320]  they can, it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a
[1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:47.320]  huge sum for all that gas that's being emitted.
[1:00:47.320 --> 1:00:49.800]  Would you close down the oil industry?
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:55.520]  I have a transition from the oil industry, yes, I will transition, it is a big statement
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:01:03.000]  because I would stop because the oil industry pollutes significantly, and here's the deal,
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:07.760]  what's the big statement? If you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:09.320]  by renewable energy.
[1:01:09.320 --> 1:01:16.480]  Basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:19.600]  that Texas, will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.560]  Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond, and then I have to get to the
[1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:24.480]  final question, Vice President Biden.
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:30.680]  It takes everything out of context, but the point is look, we have to move toward a net
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:31.960]  zero emissions.
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:38.640]  I want you to look in my eyes, I guarantee you, I guarantee you we're going to end fossil
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:43.040]  fuel, one of which is doing away with any subsidies for fossil fuels, number one, number
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:47.680]  two, holding them liable for what they have done.
[1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:53.160]  We will double offshore wind, we will end any subsidies for coal or any other fossil
[1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:54.160]  fuel.
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:59.040]  If Biden got in you'd be paying $7, $8, $9, didn't this say get rid of your car?
[1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:07.760]  It is absolutely imperative and a life and death issue that we have got to transform
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:13.840]  our energy system away from fossil fuel to sustainable energy.
[1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:20.240]  If these far left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry,
[1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.400]  but the entire US economy.
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:27.680]  On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order revoking the permit
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:29.800]  of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
[1:02:29.800 --> 1:02:32.880]  You may have noticed this week that your gas prices have gone up.
[1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:35.040]  I want to talk to you a little bit about why.
[1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:39.200]  A lot of it has to do with Vladimir Putin, but part of this is on the oil companies.
[1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:44.960]  Right now there are 9,000 approved unused permits that oil and gas companies could tap
[1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:47.920]  into now to ramp up production.
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:54.000]  Gas prices at a seven year high in one California town, now topping $7 a gallon and unfortunately
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.880]  there is no relief in sight.
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:02:59.560]  They're sitting at a seven year high and expected to continue to climb.
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:02.880]  Gas prices are soaring with little end in sight.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:06.080]  Gas prices reach all time highs under Joe Biden.
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:11.960]  Today, the average gas price in America hit an all time record high of over $4 per gallon.
[1:03:11.960 --> 1:03:17.880]  I'm willing to pay $4 a gallon, hell I'll pay $15 a gallon because I drive a Tesla.
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:23.440]  What is the grand home plan to increase oil production in America?
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:29.720]  Oh my God, that is hilarious, wood that I had the magic wand on.
[1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:32.040]  Every time I fill up it's close to like $89.
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:35.040]  How do you feel about that?
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:37.520]  It's making me groan.
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:43.560]  Oh my God, if I'm not making a certain goal for the night, I don't have enough for gas
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:50.400]  tomorrow and then I have to eat into my own general family budget to put gas in my car
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:51.400]  for this job.
[1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:57.880]  I mean, it's hard to make plans when you've got an administration that's trying to crush
[1:03:57.880 --> 1:03:58.880]  your future.
[1:03:58.880 --> 1:04:02.560]  Oh my God, that is hilarious.
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:06.720]  Perhaps if you let the market work in this respect, people will feel pain, they'll take
[1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:12.720]  a second look at that Ford F450 Gigantoi truck, they'll reconsider it Tesla, you'll see hybrid
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:13.720]  innovation.
[1:04:13.720 --> 1:04:17.840]  We should ultimately learn our lesson here and become energy independent and choose
[1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:21.880]  to invest in clean domestic energy.
[1:04:21.880 --> 1:04:26.920]  You're talking about zero carbon emissions, no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:28.120]  That is the goal.
[1:04:28.120 --> 1:04:29.120]  It's ambitious.
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:30.120]  How is that possible?
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:33.520]  You're talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:40.320]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:05:07.480]  now.
[1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:17.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:27.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:05:27.480 --> 1:05:38.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:49.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:06:09.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:30.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:06:30.480 --> 1:06:55.480]  It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible, right?
[1:06:55.480 --> 1:07:05.480]  Now, back on June 30th, 21 days ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA can't just make law
[1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:09.480]  and ban power plants and shut down U.S. energy.
[1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:12.480]  And Biden's response is this authoritarian takeover.
[1:07:12.480 --> 1:07:18.480]  Someone who's been on this as much as myself from Mark Moreno, one of the top people exposing
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:25.480]  and we'll get Mark Moreno on, by the way, a very simple climate depot, is Mike Adams of Natural News.
[1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:27.480]  He's also an engineer and scientist in his own right.
[1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.480]  He's got a bunch of big articles about it as well.
[1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:38.480]  We're going to be laying out, but this is bone-chilling and it ties in to the National Defense Authorization Act
[1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:44.480]  Amendment HR 4350 for domestic military operations against, quote, right-wing extremists
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:45.480]  and no congressional oversight.
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:48.480]  This is all dictatorship, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:52.480]  And people have been living in this tyranny so long they think, oh, well, it's not that bad.
[1:07:52.480 --> 1:07:54.480]  They're also announcing new imminent lockdowns.
[1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:55.480]  I have a whole stack on that.
[1:07:55.480 --> 1:07:56.480]  We'll cover bottom of the hour.
[1:07:56.480 --> 1:08:00.480]  But what you saw the last three years was just the training wheels.
[1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.480]  It was the beta test.
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:05.480]  It's all now about to go to the next level.
[1:08:05.480 --> 1:08:08.480]  So, Mike Adams, thank you for joining us.
[1:08:08.480 --> 1:08:10.480]  This is so much to cover here.
[1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:17.480]  I don't think we can overstate how insane, how authoritarian this is just by the executive actions.
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:20.480]  And if they implement these, the total collapse of society.
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:21.480]  And they're saying, don't worry.
[1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:24.480]  We're going to not let you travel because there won't be the energy.
[1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.480]  There won't be the electricity for the electric cars.
[1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:27.480]  There won't be the gas for the cars.
[1:08:27.480 --> 1:08:36.480]  There won't be energy for the factories that are already turning off while Russia and Saudi Arabia get even richer.
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:38.480]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:40.480]  So, Mike Adams, thank you so much for joining us.
[1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:41.480]  naturalloose.com.
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  Lay it on us.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.480]  Well, it is total economic sabotage against America.
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:54.480]  They're trying to thrust America into a Sri Lanka type of scenario with a complete collapse of energy of fuel of transportation,
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:55.480]  which means a food collapse.
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:58.480]  It means social unrest, massive uprising.
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:03.480]  And the thing is that these left-wing climate cultists who are putting all this in place,
[1:09:03.480 --> 1:09:10.480]  they seemingly don't have any understanding of the role of diesel fuel in society, for example.
[1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.480]  They don't understand that trains are operated on diesel.
[1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.480]  They're diesel-electric hybrid trains.
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:23.480]  And without diesel fuel, you don't get trains delivering coal to the power plants to charge the electric cars.
[1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:26.480]  So they're out there telling everybody, go out and buy electric cars.
[1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:31.480]  But where are you going to get the power from if there's no diesel to deliver coal to the power plants?
[1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:35.480]  And there are other contradictions in this that are just maddening, Alex.
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:43.480]  For example, Joe Biden complaining to gasoline retailers, complaining to the oil companies that you're not refining enough fuel,
[1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:46.480]  and you need to refine more to bring prices down.
[1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:50.480]  And yet, in these executive orders that are about to be announced,
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:55.480]  they are going to halt all infrastructure investments in fossil fuel,
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:57.480]  which means no one can build refineries.
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:09:59.480]  There will be no private investment.
[1:09:59.480 --> 1:10:01.480]  Let's go further. It's worse than that. You're right.
[1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.480]  It says no investment by executive order will be allowed in fossil fuel energy.
[1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:09.480]  So it's like the feds say you can't sell cocaine.
[1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  Well, they got to pass a law to do that.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.480]  Now they're saying no investment is allowed in fossil fuels.
[1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:17.480]  I mean, this is worse than I even thought they would do.
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:19.480]  It's really beyond sabotage.
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:23.480]  I have to call it ecoterrorism by the state.
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.480]  That's what this is. It's ecoterrorism.
[1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:29.480]  These people are cultists. Even on a scientific basis, they're wrong.
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.480]  From the get-go, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.
[1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:36.480]  Carbon dioxide is the single most important nutrient for growing crops,
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:42.480]  growing food, growing rainforest, and having flowers for pollinators such as honeybees.
[1:10:42.480 --> 1:10:46.480]  Look, if you are pro-environment, you have to be pro-carbon dioxide,
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:49.480]  because CO2 is necessary for photosynthesis.
[1:10:49.480 --> 1:10:53.480]  Even NASA, their satellite photos, show that the higher CO2 gets in the atmosphere,
[1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:58.480]  and it's barely above 400 parts per million, the higher it gets, the greener the earth becomes.
[1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:02.480]  CO2 is a greening molecule, and yet it's under attack.
[1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:05.480]  And by the way, all of this is about to happen.
[1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:08.480]  This ignores the recent Supreme Court ruling that you just mentioned.
[1:11:08.480 --> 1:11:12.480]  The Supreme Court says you can't just regulate out of existence the fossil fuel industry,
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:15.480]  but they're trying to do it by executive fiat.
[1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:20.480]  The question is, how will this get challenged, and what will be the damage in the meantime?
[1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:29.480]  And look, if this isn't changed, you're going to see gasoline at $10, $15, $20 a gallon sometime next year
[1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:31.480]  if we don't reverse course on this.
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.480]  And what's incredible, you mentioned, they've cut off thousands of small pipelines,
[1:11:35.480 --> 1:11:38.480]  hundreds of medium-sized, over 10 large ones, including Keystone.
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.480]  They say it's a transition, and then they say, oh, it's Putin's fault.
[1:11:42.480 --> 1:11:46.480]  I know the world's starving because of Putin, but they're the ones shutting off the fuel,
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:48.480]  not just to us, but to the world.
[1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:51.480]  The US was the biggest exporter just two years ago.
[1:11:51.480 --> 1:11:53.480]  It's now a number three or four position.
[1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:56.480]  Now we can't sell oil or gas to Europe that needs it.
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:11:58.480]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[1:11:58.480 --> 1:11:59.480]  Well, right.
[1:11:59.480 --> 1:12:03.480]  And look, we have to, this is parallel to the shutting down of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline,
[1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:06.480]  providing gas to Germany and Western Europe.
[1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:09.480]  And of course, right now, the Nord Stream 1 is under a 10-day maintenance window.
[1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:15.480]  There's a lot of speculation of whether Russia's going to, excuse me, turn it back on tomorrow
[1:12:15.480 --> 1:12:17.480]  or the next day after the maintenance window.
[1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:19.480]  Well, they need parts.
[1:12:19.480 --> 1:12:24.480]  They need this turbine that Canada has been holding on to because of the economic sanctions against Russia.
[1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:29.480]  And Russia has just announced that very likely they will have reduced gas flows,
[1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:32.480]  maybe 20% of capacity to Western Europe.
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.480]  So a lot of us in America, we've been looking at this and saying,
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  gosh, Western Europe is in a world of hurt.
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:38.480]  What are they going to do this winter?
[1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:40.480]  How is Germany going to run its industry?
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:46.480]  They're looking at a GDP reduction in Germany alone of maybe 15%, 20%, even 25%.
[1:12:46.480 --> 1:12:49.480]  If they don't get this gas, you know, from Russia.
[1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:56.480]  But then Joe Biden does to America what Europeans are afraid that Putin is doing to Western Europe.
[1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:02.480]  So Joe Biden is, he's worse than Putin in terms of what they're blaming Putin for doing.
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:04.480]  Joe Biden's cutting off energy for America.
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:05.480]  Let me just be clear.
[1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:08.480]  They say they may never open the Keystone pipeline.
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:11.480]  Europe says they may never allow Nord Stream 2 to open.
[1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.480]  They won't give the parts to Russia.
[1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:17.480]  Then they blame Russia, but the West is publicly doing this.
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:18.480]  That's right.
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:19.480]  This is deliberate.
[1:13:19.480 --> 1:13:24.480]  You know, Joe Biden can't blame Russia for this when Biden is signing the executive orders
[1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:26.480]  and declaring a climate emergency.
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:32.480]  And again, you know, we almost need some kind of a cult rescue deprogramming team or something
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:36.480]  to go in and rescue these people from the climate cult.
[1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:40.480]  And yeah, you should get Mark Moreno on because he knows exactly what I'm talking about here.
[1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.480]  It's a climate cult.
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:43.480]  They hate humanity.
[1:13:43.480 --> 1:13:46.480]  They were thrilled about the COVID lockdowns.
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:48.480]  When everybody was locked down, nobody could work.
[1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:51.480]  And they said, oh, look how clear the skies are.
[1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:52.480]  This is great.
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:53.480]  We should have lockdowns forever.
[1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:54.480]  Well, that's what they're trying to do now.
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:56.480]  Well, they said two years ago, we covered it.
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:57.480]  You covered it here.
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:02.480]  Now we're going to cut the fuel off and have a lockdown that way because there'll be no fuel.
[1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:04.480]  This is exactly what's coming.
[1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:10.480]  So, and you know, the ramifications of this are going to be mass starvation, food scarcity on a level we've never seen before,
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:13.480]  destitution, layoffs, homelessness.
[1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:18.480]  And on top of that, they're just going to try to print money to push money into people's hands.
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:19.480]  That's right.
[1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.480]  They've already got a multi-quadrillion spending package they want.
[1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:23.480]  Yeah.
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.480]  Mike, where's the Republican leadership on this?
[1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.480]  We're not hearing anything.
[1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:29.480]  This is a huge question.
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:36.480]  The Republicans are just kind of, they're acting around the edges of this and they're not confronting this head on.
[1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:39.480]  I mean, this is the final economic takedown of America.
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:42.480]  And by the way, where are the oil companies on this right now?
[1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:44.480]  They should be screaming about this.
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:48.480]  This is the end of the oil industry in America if this goes through.
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:57.480]  I mean, just to be clear, we're talking about 11 million acres of so-called federal waters that where the leases for extraction and exploration would be ended.
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:58.480]  And let's be clear.
[1:14:58.480 --> 1:14:59.480]  Let's be clear.
[1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:02.480]  They had to max up in the last decade to just get us the supply we needed.
[1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:08.480]  By killing this, it collapses decades of work and you can't just turn these things back on.
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:10.480]  Well, that's exactly right.
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:18.480]  See, this is going to bankrupt the oil industry because the payoff of the investment in the oil rigs and the oil refineries is decades.
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:23.480]  So if that gets just shut down, then their cash flow goes wildly negative.
[1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:24.480]  They go bankrupt.
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:26.480]  And of course, that's the plan that Barack Obama talked about.
[1:15:26.480 --> 1:15:28.480]  He's like, we're going to bankrupt you.
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:31.480]  Yeah, you can build a coal plant, but we're going to bankrupt you.
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:34.480]  And let's be clear, though, there is no replacement for this.
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.480]  They keep saying, oh, it'll make us go to the replacement.
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:37.480]  No, it's a design collapse.
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:39.480]  Mike Adams is on fire.
[1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:46.480]  We're going to cover more of this and tie it in to the borders collapsing, the gun grabs, the food shortages, where it's all going next.
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:47.480]  Stay with us.
[1:15:47.480 --> 1:15:48.480]  Mike Adams, naturalnews.com.

[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:19.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:37.480]  The world energy supply is being shut off right now. The third world is collapsing and it's not like you're truly Alex Jones and Mike Adams just sort of saying this this month or this week.
[1:20:37.480 --> 1:20:55.480]  Mike has been the absolute tip of the spear and so is info wars and it's not about credit. It's about people getting through their heads. How do we know all this before it happens because we read the UNWAF Rockefeller Foundation plans and look already how bad inflation is already look at the food shortages
[1:20:55.480 --> 1:21:09.480]  already look at the baby formula for shortages that at nauseam Mike Adams and yours truly and I'm not I don't want credit. I want you to listen and I know the general audience does but no one has been better than Mike Adams and Alex Jones.
[1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:27.480]  No one on wide spectrum analysis has been more dead on and so when I tell you total collapse is coming in hell on earth, baby, I am completely upset and concerned and because I know it's going down.
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:42.480]  I know what the world's gonna look like. I gotta tell you, it's crazy that the New World Order thinks are gonna get away with this because people are waking up fast but they own most of the opposition leadership who even pay lip service against it.
[1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:50.480]  And so that's why they decided to go ahead and try this and they control the media. I don't think the globalist are on good footing. If we just sat back and let them do all this, they could have won.
[1:21:50.480 --> 1:21:59.480]  I don't see how they succeed long term with this one. It's gonna be so destructive, so horrible as long as they're being exposed along the way, but that's where the censorship comes in.
[1:21:59.480 --> 1:22:11.480]  They think if they can silence us, then the general public won't know what's happening but the bat signals already fired. People are getting it like Orban and Bolsonaro and so many others.
[1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:26.480]  So Mike, I could ask you a thousand questions but you've got a lot of big articles analyzing different aspects of this collapse. So we talk about how we stop it or what's gonna come next because when I read this, it is way more, I mean, it's what they wanted to do in their end game.
[1:22:26.480 --> 1:22:42.480]  Ban all gas powered engines, ban all oil exploration, ban all exporting. I mean, it's just so draconian. We've seen actuaries by Lord Monk and others that if they didn't even have the climate cuts they wanted would kill billions of people the next decade.
[1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:48.480]  This will end industrial society with no replacement, Mike Adams.
[1:22:48.480 --> 1:23:00.480]  You just hit upon a key issue, no replacement. They called us a transition and they claim they're transitioning to green energy, but it's not a transition. It's an extermination because the green energy infrastructure does not exist.
[1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:10.480]  It's not ready. They don't have high density power storage systems in order to store excess wind power or solar power. They only use, I mean, look at ERCOT here in Texas.
[1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:20.480]  They use wind power as it's generated. They use solar as it's generated. When the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine, which is about half the time, they don't have any power from that whatsoever.
[1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:31.480]  Now, in addition to that, I would say you and I, Alex, we both support the ideas of a hot fusion and cold fusion technology that has been suppressed. You've talked about this.
[1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:43.480]  We know the suppression of those technologies has been going on for decades and there are breakthroughs right now in low energy nuclear reactions. LENR, as it's known, that's cold fusion, but it's being suppressed because they don't want a solution.
[1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:54.480]  Now, cold fusion is clean. Even hot fusion is clean. It's not like nuclear energy. It doesn't need the same materials. It doesn't produce radioactive waste, but it's being suppressed.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:24:09.480]  So if they wanted to wait 20, 30 years until we have commercial clean energy systems available and then say, okay, let's transition now, people like you and I might be able to get behind that in the year 2050 or something, but that's not what they're doing.
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:23.480]  They're halting the energy that works, which is oil and fossil fuels, and then they're saying, we're all going to be green while we starve to death and while your economy collapses and while there's mass homelessness and social unrest and uprisings and riots and government collapse all across the world.
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:34.480]  That's what they're saying. And the people saying that know they don't have a replacement. They admit they want depopulation and their own literature. So they're sabotaging civilization. How do they think they're going to survive this?
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:39.480]  Because I mean, they know we won't survive, but how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[1:24:39.480 --> 1:24:57.480]  Well, I think one of the key questions is what happens at the state level. So what does Governor Abbott do in Texas when these emergency executive orders go out? Obviously, probably 20 plus states are going to sue the federal government over these executive orders and try to get a Supreme Court decision on this, or maybe a district court decision.
[1:24:57.480 --> 1:25:09.480]  But if that's not successful, you have to wonder if states like Texas are going to somehow secede from these onerous orders by the federal government. I mean, Texas cannot give up its energy infrastructure.
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:19.480]  Texas is the largest exporter in the United States of America. And a lot of those exports are energy. Texas would be bankrupt without energy. And why would we want to give that up, Alex? This is the other question.
[1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:27.480]  America has more than enough energy right now to run for centuries. We can be energy independent.
[1:25:27.480 --> 1:25:35.480]  Centuries of oil, 3,000 years of discovered coal. And you're not just saying this. Let me show people Biden's new quote, emergency powers, dictatorship.
[1:25:35.480 --> 1:25:55.480]  Page four, it says key climate emergency executive actions and orders. Halt crude exports. It says 100% ban on all exports of oil. Stop oil and gas drilling. Restrict international trade and private investment in fossil fuels.
[1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:58.480]  It just goes on. I mean, this is a recipe for destruction.
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:06.480]  And there's another section there. I think number four or five that says there will be no more allowed investment in building fossil fuel infrastructure.
[1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:07.480]  Here it is.
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:19.480]  So that's refineries. That's pipelines. That's the way society functions right now. Again, you can't just crush what's working today and then call it a transition. It's not a transition. It's like building.
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:24.480]  And it's a build back better. They say we're going to build and then the executive order says we're going to destroy.
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:33.480]  Right, right. It's, it's destroyed back better is all it is. But they're, they're just running our economy off a cliff. And, but as you know, this is the plan.
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:43.480]  This is just what WEF and Gena 2030, they're accelerating it now like you covered. And they're trying to achieve global depopulation sooner than they had previously planned.
[1:26:43.480 --> 1:26:46.480]  Why are they accelerating? Why are they accelerating?
[1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:54.480]  Well, again, the globalists believe that Earth is past a tipping point unless they murder 7 billion human beings.
[1:26:54.480 --> 1:27:01.480]  Now, they're wrong in that belief, but they believe it so strongly that they're willing to go insane and shut down economies and cause mass starvation.
[1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:04.480]  And of course, get pure power and total control in the process.
[1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:20.480]  Well, absolutely. And they sure love the COVID lockdowns. And now they're, they're trying to work monkeypox into some kind of a big global emergency. But honestly, folks, if, if you're not a gay person having gay anal intercourse with 50 partners,
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:28.480]  your risk of monkeypox is pretty much zero. That's a gay disease that's spread in New York City, the gay capital and the abortion capital of America.
[1:27:28.480 --> 1:27:36.480]  So, you know, they're going to have a hard time pushing that globally. But now in the UK, they're trying to have vaccines, monkeypox vaccines for children.
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.480]  And I say, you don't need monkeypox vaccines for children. What you need to do is stop raping the children.
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:55.480]  I mean, have they ever thought about that? Stop the grooming, stop the pedophilia, stop the child raped and you stop spreading this filth disease that's that's spreading among homosexuals and people who have multiple gay sex partners.
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:28:05.480]  It's very clear. Absolutely. And I'm not attacking any of these people, but it's true. HIV, monkeypox, all of it has been, those communities that we use as vectors of it.
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:18.480]  I know there's a lot of links to from the COVID vaccine to monkeypox like symptoms. Absolutely. Yeah. Sometimes a monkeypox diagnosis is a misdiagnosis of, of COVID vaccines.
[1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:28.480]  But look, you know, lifestyle choices have consequences. If you have multiple sex partners at that and you're engaging in anal intercourse, you're going to spread these diseases.
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:36.480]  Now, let's expand on that. Let's expand on that. Let's put the photo back up. Bunch of gay men reportedly all lined up to get their monkeypox shot.
[1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:47.480]  I mean, just unbelievable. We just had that photo. That's who's spreading it. And look, if you're having just a normal family, heterosexual relationship, you're at zero risk of monkeypox, but they won't tell you that.
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.480]  Let's come back and let's talk about the new climate lockdowns they've got ready with Mike Adams. Stay with us.
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:45.480]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering bodies, ultimate tumor formula and info or sort of calm. It is simply amazing.

[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:06.480]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:16.480]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:23.480]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one point, another two, that's just the truth.
[1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:34.480]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true. But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis, InstaHeart is the number one best-selling natural herbal supplement in the world

[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:33.480]  We're not covering what we think is going to happen. We're already deep into this.
[1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:36.480]  We have the enemy battle plans and we know what they're going to do next.
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:46.480]  And I remember being on air 28 years ago and reading books by former U.S. generals and members of Congress and members of MI6
[1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:51.480]  and so many others against the New World Order with quotes from globalist and documents.
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:56.480]  And I was 20 years old and thought, this is incredible if this is true.
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:02.480]  Back then the internet really wasn't around so you'd have to go to the library and I'd go to the UT library.
[1:34:02.480 --> 1:34:10.480]  And they thought a 20-year-old trying to get into the sub stacks and the back room stuff and actually having librarians pull books that nobody looked at
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:14.480]  or books that were so valuable they only had one copy of, you couldn't see it.
[1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:24.480]  And I began to open the books and read the globalist saying this and read the reports and look at the microfilm, the microfeesh,
[1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:31.480]  with David Rockefeller in the New York Times in 1976 praising Mao Zedong and saying, we want this for America.
[1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:36.480]  So we're not in the area of Mike Adams and Alex Jones trying to tell you, well, the globalists have this horrible plan
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:40.480]  and they're really powerful, we should be concerned.
[1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:42.480]  And they're brainwashing people to accept it.
[1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:50.480]  Now we're deep into a worldwide force collapse where they pose as the saviors and they bring in a hellish global casual society
[1:34:50.480 --> 1:34:55.480]  and carbon rationing and carbon lockdowns which are here now.
[1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:58.480]  And they're giggling and they're laughing, calling it a transition.
[1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:03.480]  They're like, I want to get into new lockdowns coming, got a stack of news on that, but let me ask you this.
[1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.480]  We told folks those were coming a couple of years ago.
[1:35:06.480 --> 1:35:12.480]  Big picture, how do you think it's going for the new world order and the globalists?
[1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.480]  Because it looks to me like they're in a lot of trouble, but what are they going to do?
[1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:16.480]  They're not going to give up.
[1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:22.480]  How do you see this unfolding instead of us talking about what I'm doing, how we've warned people and been accurate.
[1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.480]  Let's go back to the Alex Jones, Mike Adams of two and a half years ago where we told them what was coming
[1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:28.480]  about what's coming next.
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.480]  Well, I'm glad you brought that up because ultimately I think humanity prevails.
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:42.480]  I think that there is going to be a very horrific economic collapse and a global revolution against the globalists and all of this insanity.
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:48.480]  And I think that humanity will unleash a golden age of abundance on the other side of this.
[1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:52.480]  I believe that and I think we're going to rebuild America in Christian values.
[1:35:52.480 --> 1:36:00.480]  We're going to reestablish morality and ethics and we won't let the drag queen storytime hour pedophiles prey upon our children in the public schools.
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:02.480]  Although that's happening now.
[1:36:02.480 --> 1:36:04.480]  I think that's a very limited window.
[1:36:04.480 --> 1:36:12.480]  But in order to get there, this mass awakening is going to require sadly the globalist carrying out a lot of suffering of the people.
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:21.480]  And maybe that's God's plan for how people wake up and see what's happening to finally address the evil that's right in your face when you're starving.
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:25.480]  And you can't feed your children and gasoline is $20 a gallon.
[1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:28.480]  Then then you have to start questioning your belief system.
[1:36:28.480 --> 1:36:30.480]  Like, oh, why did you vote for Joe Biden?
[1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:34.480]  If you did not not even that many did, but some did and they got to be questioning everything right now.
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:36.480]  Or what about the vaccine?
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:47.480]  Another important point, Alex, is that I think the globalists they failed in the rollout of the vaccine in the sense of they didn't get the 95% uptake that they were hoping for.
[1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:52.480]  And this is why they're now accelerating these other attacks to cause depopulation and global collapse.
[1:36:52.480 --> 1:36:54.480]  This is why Agenda 2030 is being accelerated.
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:37:00.480]  They need in their minds, they're twisted sick minds, they need to kill off more billions of people.
[1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:02.480]  The vaccine didn't quite do it.
[1:37:02.480 --> 1:37:07.480]  So they've got to cause economic collapse now and starve people to death and have social unrest.
[1:37:07.480 --> 1:37:15.480]  So in essence, these are all positive signs that the globalists are failing and that humanity is not done.
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:20.480]  Humanity has a chance to reverse course and I believe that day is coming.
[1:37:20.480 --> 1:37:28.480]  I totally agree with you and I sit back and I look at this and I just asked myself,
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:34.480]  what are we going to do this time when they bring my new lockdowns back that they're announcing in Europe, the US, everywhere?
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:35.480]  Here's some of the headlines.
[1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:38.480]  New COVID wave imminent says the UN.
[1:37:38.480 --> 1:37:40.480]  Prepare for new lockdowns.
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:46.480]  Monkey pox concern grows as virus spreads in Chicago, they need to get loud about this.
[1:37:46.480 --> 1:37:47.480]  Yahoo News.
[1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:55.480]  COVID infections and deaths in mass mandated New Zealand sort above those in mass free Australia because of the shots.
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:38:01.480]  I mean, they're telling us that it's all about to happen again probably right before the election.
[1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:03.480]  How do you see that unfolding?
[1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:07.480]  There's no question they're going to pull out a lot more emergencies.
[1:38:07.480 --> 1:38:12.480]  But I also want to mention that I believe it was in Indianapolis or near that.
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:16.480]  Remember that armed citizen stopped that mass shooter.
[1:38:16.480 --> 1:38:18.480]  I forgot the man's name, the young man.
[1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:24.480]  Yeah, a 20 year old man with a concealed carry stopped the guy before he could kill anybody else.
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:26.480]  He was only able to kill two people and the shooter was killed.
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:32.480]  And the left, I have an article right here actually, the left here it is, is now attacking the 22 year old.
[1:38:32.480 --> 1:38:38.480]  Let this lash out 20 year old who stopped mass shooter in mall saying he was no good Samaritan.
[1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:46.480]  So we see you've all the 450 police stand down and they're on video doing hand sanitizer while the guy's killing kids.
[1:38:46.480 --> 1:38:49.480]  They're heroes, but this guy's bad.
[1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:52.480]  I tell you what, that man's his last name is Dickon.
[1:38:52.480 --> 1:39:01.480]  I'll take one Dickon with a Glock over 400 you've all the police any day because the 400 police, I'm not anti police.
[1:39:01.480 --> 1:39:05.480]  You know, I support law enforcement, but they follow orders.
[1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:07.480]  Whereas Dickon was following his heart.
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:09.480]  He was following rationality.
[1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:12.480]  He was stopping a bad person from killing more.
[1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:13.480]  Let's talk about this.
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.480]  These are programmed brainwash police following orders not to save kids.
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.480]  450 standing down wearing their gloves wearing your mask to prove they're politically correct.
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:26.480]  Putting on hand sanitizer while children beg for help and were executed.
[1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:27.480]  We're not against cops in general.
[1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:28.480]  Most of them are outraged.
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:35.480]  But this is you've all these leftist leftist police under the control putting hand sanitizer on this.
[1:39:35.480 --> 1:39:40.480]  And this is the government that wants our guns so we can't protect ourselves.
[1:39:40.480 --> 1:39:48.480]  And by the way, Dickon reportedly had an 80% hit rate with his Glock from 30 yards, which is extraordinary.
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:54.480]  I've trained with many cops on on, you know, gun ranges and so on.
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:57.480]  And 95% of cops can't do that, by the way.
[1:39:57.480 --> 1:39:59.480]  And that's when you're not getting shot at.
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:00.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:04.480]  So what we need to call written house and Mr. Dickon to be the example.
[1:40:04.480 --> 1:40:12.480]  Yes, written house and Dickon, you know, for security, any security need you have, you should call those two people and they will take care of it.
[1:40:12.480 --> 1:40:18.480]  I'm telling you, I'm really impressed with this young man, what he was able to do because, you know, I'm well trained in firearms.
[1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:22.480]  And frankly, I think I would have a hard time with that kind of a hit rate at 30 yards under pressure.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:27.480]  Anybody would. So, but the point is that this is thwarting the globalist plans.
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:28.480]  Okay.
[1:40:28.480 --> 1:40:32.480]  They wanted another mass shooting because they're unleashing these all over the country.
[1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:39.480]  And you know, some of these MK ultra people who knows what the background is, who knows what the FBI involvement is in recruiting or brainwashing these people.
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:42.480]  But it's all over and citizens are stopping it.
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:48.480]  And by the way, that was a constitutional carried law that just went into effect, I believe on July 1st in that state.
[1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:50.480]  And that's how he was carrying.
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:52.480]  I don't think he had a concealed care.
[1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:54.480]  And that's why the left doesn't.
[1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:55.480]  Exactly.
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.480]  That's why the left doesn't want our second revolution because we'll stop the crime wave they're triggering.
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:00.480]  Exactly.
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:02.480]  But there's a picture of Dickon right there.
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:04.480]  There we go.
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:08.480]  Yeah, I'll tell you what, I'll have him for security any day of the week.
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  I'll tell you what, if you go speaking in public anywhere, Alex, hire that guy for firearm security.
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:19.480]  Just give him a ballistic vest and extra magazines and he'll take care of it.
[1:41:19.480 --> 1:41:23.480]  But look, the people are fighting back against the insanity.
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:26.480]  And I think that's a metaphor of what's coming on a much larger scale.
[1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:32.480]  Like I said, Texas, is Texas going to fight back against these climate emergency executive orders?
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:33.480]  I think absolutely.
[1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:36.480]  Maybe Ken Paxton, the AG, will take action probably.
[1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:38.480]  He's well positioned to do that.
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:40.480]  I agree with you.
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:48.480]  It's so outrageous, though, to know it was on the drawing board, but to be living the globalist assault literally cutting our energy off.
[1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:50.480]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:54.480]  And the schizophrenia of the White House is beyond imagination.
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:58.480]  They say, oh, give us more oil and gas so gas prices can be lower.
[1:41:58.480 --> 1:42:04.480]  And then on the other hand, oh, we're going to stop all investment in all oil infrastructure and stop all your oil extraction off federal waters.
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:07.480]  So how can you accomplish those two goals at the same time?
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:08.480]  It's schizophrenic.
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:09.480]  It's mass mental illness.
[1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:10.480]  I totally agree.
[1:42:10.480 --> 1:42:14.480]  And Mike, this isn't a mutual admiration society, but I admire people that are right.
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:20.480]  We want to break up 30 seconds, but people need to be able to emulate how you and I have been the most accurate.
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:23.480]  And I'm seeing you out on a wide spectrum of issues.
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:25.480]  We're both about 95% accurate.
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:29.480]  We make a few mistakes, but we're trying to alter it when we come back because everybody wants to know this.
[1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:33.480]  How have you been so accurate in natural news?
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:34.480]  How have you done it?
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:43.480]  And so other people can understand that philosophy or that methodology of worldview to be so damn accurate.
[1:42:43.480 --> 1:42:47.480]  I mean, we have to celebrate our accurate generals in this fight.
[1:42:47.480 --> 1:42:49.480]  Mike Adams is amongst the best.
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.480]  It's just true.
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:51.480]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:03.480]  The number one selling category in supplements worldwide is fat burners, is weight loss formulas.
[1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:10.480]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.
[1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:19.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic system
[1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:26.480]  and your metabolism and turn that clock back by turning up your metabolism.

[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:31.480]  It's amazing.

[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:40.480]  Look it up.
[1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:46.480]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:51.480]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:56.480]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products infowarstore.com.
[1:44:56.480 --> 1:45:03.480]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:09.480]  Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:16.480]  This Info Wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the Info War Store.
[1:45:16.480 --> 1:45:23.480]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:34.480]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:43.480]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:50.480]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations like here in America.
[1:45:50.480 --> 1:46:14.480]  This time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:41.480]  We sold out of this for almost a year but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:51.480]  You can also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com or vbiopros.com.
[1:46:51.480 --> 1:47:12.480]  It is amazing and it funds the Info War.
[1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:39.480]  Transdimensionally over the space time continuum is a full space state where people are extremely lazy.
[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:41.480]  The social engineers are there laughing.
[1:47:41.480 --> 1:47:52.480]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago is now reality.
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:59.480]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:01.480]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:03.480]  It's fulfilling info wars.
[1:48:03.480 --> 1:48:06.480]  Tomorrow's news today.
[1:48:06.480 --> 1:48:11.480]  All right, we got some very positive news which I almost thought would happen looking at all this.
[1:48:11.480 --> 1:48:18.480]  Biden declared these executive orders was going to sign but out of report on climate and the president's emergency powers
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:23.480]  and was set to give a speech starting five minutes ago, eight minutes ago.
[1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.480]  Didn't give it.
[1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:32.480]  And now we have the Associated Press, others saying why Biden won't declare a national climate emergency in mass today?
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  Because he wants to sneak it through and not have it openly announced.
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:37.480]  Wow.
[1:48:37.480 --> 1:48:39.480]  So they are really in trouble.
[1:48:39.480 --> 1:48:41.480]  Another sign of extreme weakness.
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:45.480]  This power grab was so outrageous that I guess they want to slip it under the radar.
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:50.480]  Mike, I want to talk about how you've understood what's coming next, how others can and what you see coming next in a moment.
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:52.480]  And any other big stories you've got, the new lockdown is coming.
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:57.480]  But what do you make of Biden releasing this power grab but then holding back from the executive orders in the statement?
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:48:59.480]  What does that sound like to you?
[1:48:59.480 --> 1:49:05.480]  Well, I suspect behind the scenes there are a lot of powerful forces already threatening lawsuits against the federal government over this
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:12.480]  and probably people like Ken Paxton, the AG of Texas and maybe AGs of other states as well.
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:16.480]  So they know that the only way they're going to get this through is to sneak it through and then it's going to be challenged.
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:23.480]  I mean, this is the good thing about America and the structure of our constitutional republic is that power is distributed.
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:29.480]  Nevertheless, the Democrats are trying to concentrate it in the hands of the executive as you've talked about the dictatorship.
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:33.480]  But getting to the, you know, how are we so right about things?
[1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:39.480]  Look, I just want to say, Alex, you've been right more than anyone, period, for longer than anyone.
[1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:42.480]  And this is a team humanity effort.
[1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.480]  It's not just, you know, you and I and people like us, it's the whole independent media.
[1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:47.480]  It's all these amazing people.
[1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:52.480]  And I got to tell you, every time I see James O'Keefe rolling out another major investigation,
[1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:53.480]  I'm just awed.
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:58.480]  I'm truly awed by the courage of that man and what he's doing at Project Veritas.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  Just amazing.
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:03.480]  But there's so many people and I've got an announcement here to share with you.
[1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:10.480]  Recently, we gave away about $50,000 in just money to independent media outlets.
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:16.480]  We had earned that money as an affiliate of a documentary program and we pledged to give it away.
[1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:23.480]  We gave it all away to independent media and Andy Wakefield's film company and Sherry Tenpenny and Thomas Renz and a bunch of groups.
[1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:36.480]  Well, our mutual acquaintance, Gary Haven, noticed that and he said, hey, I want to give you another $100,000 for you to give away to more independent media organizations.
[1:50:36.480 --> 1:50:39.480]  So, and he authorized me to go ahead and mention this right now.
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:44.480]  Gary Haven is sending me $100,000 that I'm going to give away to all other independent media.
[1:50:44.480 --> 1:50:48.480]  It's all about the team effort and when we all come together, it could be $10 million by tomorrow.
[1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:49.480]  It's just, it's exponential.
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:50.480]  Yeah.
[1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:55.480]  And like you got the secret Bitcoin ferry, you know, who gave you Bitcoin to keep you afloat.
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:51:03.480]  I got to say, there are wealthy pro-America, pro-constitution patriots out there and they're going to carry us through this.
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:13.480]  And I got phone calls from independent media outlets who received that first check and they said, Mike, I asked God for a sign to stay online, to stay operating and then your check showed up.
[1:51:13.480 --> 1:51:15.480]  That's the difference that we can make.
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:18.480]  Even a small amount of money can make a huge difference.
[1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:19.480]  We've got the people.
[1:51:19.480 --> 1:51:20.480]  We've got the people.
[1:51:20.480 --> 1:51:21.480]  Absolutely.
[1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:22.480]  Beautiful.
[1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:23.480]  Beautiful what Gary Haven is doing.
[1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:25.480]  We salute him as well.
[1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:26.480]  Absolutely.
[1:51:26.480 --> 1:51:32.480]  And again, about being, quote, right about things, it's just like you always say, Alex, the globalists tell us their plans.
[1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:35.480]  I mean, we're not rocket scientists to figure this out.
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.480]  We're just reading what they're telling us they're going to do.
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:39.480]  That's the bottom line.
[1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:41.480]  It's right up there.
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:49.480]  Yeah, but you've been specifically, and it's not about bragging, it's about understanding, how have you gotten your head in the game to be so accurate predicting what they're going to do next?
[1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:58.480]  Because they have a lot of programs that you have to lay together like a Lego set to then see, it's like the old codes of the Revolutionary War where they'd send three letters out.
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:01.480]  You had to lay together so they know no one's going to capture all three letters.
[1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:03.480]  Then you lay all three letters together, you get the picture.
[1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:07.480]  We're really good at laying their template together and then getting the battle plan.
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:15.480]  Well, the thing, the common trait that you and I share and people in our industry is that we are voracious consumers of information.
[1:52:15.480 --> 1:52:19.480]  And so we understand the big picture and we can connect the dots.
[1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:29.480]  And then as the dots emerge, the other trait that's crucial is that we are not diminished in our ability to tell the truth, even if it's unpopular.
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:32.480]  That's right. We're not scared to tell the truth and we're willing to build platforms.
[1:52:32.480 --> 1:52:36.480]  So you got to be smart and engaged and have courage and build the platform.
[1:52:36.480 --> 1:52:44.480]  It's why this is not easy. That's why platforms like Natural News and M4s are so precious because it's decades of people supporting and working together that built this.
[1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:48.480]  It's not Mike Adams, it's not Alex Jones, it's not Gary Hay, but it's not Tucker Carlson.
[1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:54.480]  It's all of us collectively together. We're individuals, but our collective power is power.
[1:52:54.480 --> 1:53:05.480]  And you know, someday you and I are going to pass the baton to the next generation of people who will take our place and they are rising up right now and getting informed and learning the same way that we did.
[1:53:05.480 --> 1:53:15.480]  And that's the way this works. And by the way, even all the attacks like, you know, the attack on the reawakening America tour with Clay Clark, they're trying to shut it down, but it's not working.
[1:53:15.480 --> 1:53:25.480]  It is the most anti-white supremacist true love, multiracial coming together. That's why, and then they call it a Nazi event. That made me angry.
[1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:33.480]  It's just such a blatant lie, but it's a ridiculous lie. You know, it's like them dressing up their men as women. It's ridiculous.
[1:53:33.480 --> 1:53:42.480]  It's a clown world parade. And yeah, I've spoken at the reawakening America tour and I will speak again at every event that's in the state of Texas.
[1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:52.480]  Clay's invited me to speak every time. I've also interviewed Pastor Leon Benjamin at his events, who was one of the most amazing individuals in America.
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:59.480]  And of course, he's a black American and he loves America. And he's the furthest thing from a white supremacist.
[1:53:59.480 --> 1:54:05.480]  Well, that's why they're calling us white supremacist because I got to say, I'm not just trying to give black folks a pat on the head to just to do it.
[1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:15.480]  I see black folks, the fastest awakening group and the most powerful new movement against the enemy. I mean, what I see with blacks waking up is just explosive.
[1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:17.480]  And that scares the enemy.
[1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:27.480]  Let's talk about the Latinos in Texas who are waking up and all across America because the Latinos, if you think about it, they share so many of the family values that made America great.
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:38.480]  They want to raise children in a healthy environment. They want honest schooling and also they want to be able to keep the products of their labor because the Latino and Latina people that I know are hard workers.
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:44.480]  They're willing to work and they want to be able to save money and give their children a better future. They want the American dream.
[1:54:44.480 --> 1:55:02.480]  Absolutely. And look, I say, see, I am pro legal immigration. Anybody who wants to come to America and be part of the American fabric and culture and work hard and realize the amazing jewel that America is, we welcome you.
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:06.480]  It's just illegal immigration that I'm opposed to being brought in by the Democrats to control.
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:16.480]  And Mike, you're going to host the next five minutes, which you agreed to do while I bring Robert Barnes in and get him set up and ready. I'll be listening. Thank you so much. Natural news.com. We'll talk to Mike Adams again here in a moment.
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:27.480]  Back to the listeners. We got some huge donations in the last four months that I learned only backed up. It was God's will that outside accounting firm to come in. We were way behind.
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:38.480]  We were $5 million in the hole, not 2 million, like I said, and then the $7 million donation. Let us pay off the $5 million in bills for bandwidth and crew and legal and all the rest of it.
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:46.480]  And then the 2 million went to my product, which we've got a new major top manufacturer. I won't mention for almost all of it, highest quality testing.
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:49.480]  Now the products are coming in quicker than we thought.
[1:55:49.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  So within two months, 15 of the products sold out for almost a year on average, eight months on average, they will be back in stock and already things like bodies back in stock and new products like diet force back in stock and next week, vitamin refusion back in stock.
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:13.480]  So we will not be here hopefully in three, four months desperately saying we need support now, but we need it now. And boy, this is just nip and tuck how this continues to work.

[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:16.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we went out and did deep research on the safest, healthiest ways to take your overall body's metabolic system and your metabolism and turn that clock back by turning up your metabolism.

[2:00:11.480 --> 2:00:21.480]  All right, welcome back folks. Mike Adams here just hosting this five minute segment and then Robert Barnes will be in studio at six after with Alex Jones and they're just setting that up right now.
[2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:35.480]  So I'm taking this segment and thank you for continuing with me today. I just want to say it's truly it's astounding and it's amazing that info wars has its product line back in stock because the logistics of sourcing raw materials right now.
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:52.480]  And I can say this perhaps more qualified than it's because I'm in the industry. It is almost impossible to get these that you want to get the supplies that you want and then to get manufacturing telling you right now folks the there's a shortage on labels for bottle labeling.
[2:00:52.480 --> 2:01:12.480]  You wouldn't even believe it but labels are back ordered. I don't know four to six months right now in America just to put labels on a bottle and then the bottles are in short supply the bottle caps spray nozzles any kind of container that's used for nutritional supplements and personal care is very, very difficult to get right now.
[2:01:12.480 --> 2:01:27.480]  In fact the capsules certain types of capsules are extremely difficult to get right now like veggie caps for example are just out of stock with one major supplier so that's not just it's not even available.
[2:01:27.480 --> 2:01:44.480]  So take advantage of this because we don't know how the interruptions are going to kick in over time go to info war store right now get what you need now and even stock up on it now because these products are good for several years and they've got it in stock.
[2:01:44.480 --> 2:01:59.480]  And the other issue that we're going to run into by the way and very few people have talked about this is that the carriers UPS and FedEx and USPS primarily the carriers are going to face problems with diesel fuel and diesel engine oil.
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:21.480]  And I've covered this extensively the shortage of diesel engine oil additives and how that may impact logistics and transportation later this year as as trucks long haul rigs and also diesel trains are not going to have the ready supply of diesel engine oil that they need in order to do the oil changes every 25,000 miles in the case of highway rigs.
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:28.480]  So we're going to run into a lot of supply chain logistics that are going to affect your ability to get products.
[2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:31.480]  I was just looking at the financials of Amazon.
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:32.480]  Last night.
[2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:41.480]  Amazon is contracting Amazon is really imploding and their cash flow is for the first quarter ever it's really really crunched.
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:43.480]  And they are closing down warehouses.
[2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:48.480]  They are closing down their internal supply chain to some degree.
[2:02:48.480 --> 2:02:56.480]  I mean there's still a massive company, but they're letting go of, I think tens of millions of square feet of leasing and planned future construction.
[2:02:56.480 --> 2:02:58.480]  Amazon is imploding.
[2:02:58.480 --> 2:03:02.480]  Infowars is growing. Infowars has new supply.
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:03.480]  It's expanding.
[2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:05.480]  And this represents a shift.
[2:03:05.480 --> 2:03:23.480]  Fewer people are buying products from globalist companies like Amazon, although they're still massive, but people are deliberately choosing to support retail operations like Infowars and other independent media operations like mine and others, because they want to support pro America organizations.
[2:03:23.480 --> 2:03:27.480]  And that's another major reason to support Infowars Store.
[2:03:27.480 --> 2:03:31.480]  Now, Amazon, the effects are happening.
[2:03:31.480 --> 2:03:32.480]  Your efforts are working.
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:37.480]  Anything that you can buy elsewhere other than Amazon.com, do it.
[2:03:37.480 --> 2:03:40.480]  Can you buy products directly from manufacturers?
[2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:45.480]  Can you find another retailer that will sell it online that isn't a globalist organization?
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:50.480]  Anytime you can do that, make that choice and that choice will have a big impact.
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:58.480]  Now, later this year, keep in mind, I already mentioned UPS FedEx and USPS may suffer logistics failures.
[2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:03.480]  Now, they move mostly by truck, but also in some cases by rail.
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:06.480]  But rail is being looted out in California.
[2:04:06.480 --> 2:04:08.480]  A lot of thefts off the railroad cars there.
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:18.480]  And trucks, the trucking industry is in an emergency now because of the AB5 law in California, where the independent contractors can't run there in California with their trucks.
[2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:26.480]  So we're going to see more disruptions, which means place orders for anything that you're getting, preparedness supplies, supplements, food, whatever.
[2:04:26.480 --> 2:04:32.480]  Place orders ahead of time and expect, have patience, expect to wait longer to get those products.
[2:04:32.480 --> 2:04:35.480]  And someday you may not get them at all.
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:41.480]  Someday UPS is going to announce probably quotas, like you can only ship a certain number of boxes per day per shipper.
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:43.480]  So those are my thoughts on the subject.
[2:04:43.480 --> 2:04:48.480]  Robert Barnes live in studio with Alex Jones coming up next after this one minute break.
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:51.480]  Thank you for watching today on Mike Adams. Take care.
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:07.480]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:16.480]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[2:05:16.480 --> 2:05:18.480]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:24.480]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, two, that's just the truth.
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:26.480]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.
[2:05:26.480 --> 2:05:38.480]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis, InstaHard is the number one best-selling natural herbal supplement in the world when it comes to male enhancement because it really works.
[2:05:38.480 --> 2:05:40.480]  It also gives you a ton of energy.
[2:05:40.480 --> 2:05:43.480]  And you can find it at theironpatriot.com.
[2:05:43.480 --> 2:05:47.480]  That just takes you to their website, but then we get some of the credit as a sponsor.

[2:06:20.480 --> 2:06:24.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are at an amazing moment.
[2:06:24.480 --> 2:06:28.480]  We are watching the deep state in full panic.
[2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:36.480]  The Supreme Court three weeks ago ruled that government agencies can't just make rulings outside of law and shut down all U.S. energy.
[2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:43.480]  Biden said he would counter it with executive action and announced executive orders yesterday that he would release this morning.
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:55.480]  He released a 52-page climate president's emergency powers, the climate president's emergency powers, that says all exports banned.
[2:06:55.480 --> 2:06:59.480]  I mean, that alone is the most insane blockade against America I've ever heard of.
[2:06:59.480 --> 2:07:03.480]  That alone is so bombshell, I'm like, dizzy.
[2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:06.480]  Then he says no more oil exploration.
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:09.480]  Then he says we're going to outlaw combustion engines.
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:12.480]  I showed this five times the last two hours.
[2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:14.480]  I mean, I can't even believe it myself.
[2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:16.480]  If you're listening on radio, you don't believe me, you shouldn't.
[2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:20.480]  You should go look at this yourself, got a link to it in the live show feed.
[2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:22.480]  And then it gets worse from there.
[2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:25.480]  This is a climate dictatorship, nothing to do with the climate.
[2:07:25.480 --> 2:07:27.480]  It's all about a power grab.
[2:07:27.480 --> 2:07:35.480]  Then he said at 1245, 30 minutes ago, or 25 minutes ago, that they were going to have a speech this morning.
[2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:37.480]  They said it was canceled.
[2:07:37.480 --> 2:07:43.480]  Then, I guess they had to rewrite his announcement, now they announced coming up in an hour, he's going to give a speech.
[2:07:43.480 --> 2:07:53.480]  So they are disjointed, confused, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to implement this globalist agenda.
[2:07:53.480 --> 2:08:01.480]  The constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here with us in studio to lay this out and so much more today coming up.
[2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:03.480]  But Barnes, your take on this.
[2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:09.480]  Well, I don't think they can give Joe Biden enough brain force to recover from his dementia, so we'll see how he does in an hour.
[2:08:09.480 --> 2:08:15.480]  But what we have is what we talked about all the way back two years ago, when all this started with the pandemic lockdowns and the emergency powers,
[2:08:15.480 --> 2:08:23.480]  goes all the way back to the Weimar Constitution in Germany, goes back to what happened here in the United States in the Trilogy of Infamy of Cases in the beginning of the 20th century.
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:34.480]  Emergency powers pose the greatest risk and the greatest threat to constitutional liberties and freedoms that can possibly exist in the last century plus, both in the United States and in Europe and around the globe.
[2:08:34.480 --> 2:08:46.480]  And we said if this Pandora's Box is opened, they're going to keep going back and reopening it and reopening it and reopening it over and over and over again for whatever they want, for whatever power grab is their latest power grab.
[2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:52.480]  This climate emergency set of orders that he's talking about is patently unconstitutional.
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:09:03.480]  Here's an example. This goes back to the U.S. Supreme Court has already said the CDC can't use its public health authority to regulate tenant landlord relationships in local areas.
[2:09:03.480 --> 2:09:04.480]  And yet they're talking about...
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:07.480]  Shows the CDC power grab. It's just they can't help it.
[2:09:07.480 --> 2:09:16.480]  Exactly. And yet here they are going back declaring that they can monitor what is in your car, what is in your home, how much you use your car.
[2:09:16.480 --> 2:09:18.480]  They're talking about using individual synch.
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:21.480]  That's why they passed last year the law for tracking computers in all cars.
[2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:27.480]  And it even says here no investment allowed in fossil fuels by executive order, like we're a foreign country.
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:36.480]  Precisely. And it also goes to, we talked about the beginning when they started doing these sanctions against random people connected to Russia, that they would misuse and abuse that power and they're doing that as well.
[2:09:36.480 --> 2:09:45.480]  They're citing sanctions power to say they can go after individuals, again, for things that have never passed legislation, never gone through the court process, never gone through...
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:49.480]  I mean, they basically are taking the way in which they have rigged other...
[2:09:49.480 --> 2:09:57.480]  Five pages on the office of the president and he lists other agencies will ban investment in fossil fuel outside of law.
[2:09:57.480 --> 2:10:00.480]  I mean, what? Who's going to enforce that?
[2:10:00.480 --> 2:10:03.480]  That's what happens when you allow these individual sanctions.
[2:10:03.480 --> 2:10:06.480]  So first they did it in the name of the pandemic, then they did it in the name of Ukraine.
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:15.480]  And in both contexts, they were using it as testing grounds to see how much they could just universally and unilaterally assert power that deprives all of the rule of law.
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:27.480]  So that there's no court protection, no legislative process, even the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled in West Virginia versus EPA that on major questions, the executive branch does not have the power to make law.
[2:10:27.480 --> 2:10:28.480]  That's right.
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:29.480]  And that's exactly what they're doing here.
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:30.480]  So this is a constitutional crisis.
[2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:37.480]  Completely. I mean, this is, you add to what they're doing with trying to mandate abortions and violation of the Dobs decision overturning row.
[2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:47.480]  You look at what New York and California are trying to do in terms of trying to effectively overturn the Second Amendment Supreme Court decisions by reinstating even harsher restrictions.
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:53.480]  And the press secretary has said on all three issues of energy and abortion and guns, we're ignoring the Supreme Court.
[2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:54.480]  Yes, they've been open.
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:56.480]  I mean, if they can't stack it, they'll scrap it.
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:10:57.480]  And that's what they're doing.
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:10:59.480]  They're effectively scrapping the U.S. Supreme Court.
[2:10:59.480 --> 2:11:01.480]  And as you said yesterday, they've announced stacking plans.
[2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:02.480]  Yes.
[2:11:02.480 --> 2:11:03.480]  And that's their contingent plan.
[2:11:03.480 --> 2:11:16.480]  If somehow the courts do, in fact, step in and stop this unconstitutional action by the Biden administration and by these other correlated agencies, then they are going to try to stack it and then add for Supreme Court.
[2:11:16.480 --> 2:11:19.480]  And by the way, as you know, this happened 15 years ago or so in Venezuela.
[2:11:19.480 --> 2:11:24.480]  The government wasn't going along with Hugo Chavez, so they just expanded the Supreme Court with their appointees.
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:28.480]  It's one of the oldest games around is you just change who's on the court.
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.480]  The last time this was threatened was FDR in the 1930s, and he got what he wanted.
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:38.480]  The court capitulated and went along with him just by his threats to stack the court.
[2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:42.480]  And partially the threat to stack the court is intended to do it, intimidate the court.
[2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:43.480]  Hasn't it backfired?
[2:11:43.480 --> 2:11:44.480]  So far it has.
[2:11:44.480 --> 2:11:48.480]  I mean, what we saw from this Supreme Court at the end, there were a lot of decisions they could have stepped.
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:55.480]  It probably worked in part due also to the poor appointment of Barrett in the election context, but it didn't work in the religious context.
[2:11:55.480 --> 2:11:59.480]  It didn't work in the Second Amendment context. It didn't work in the vaccine to mandate for employee contact.
[2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:00.480]  It's very heartening.
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:03.480]  So does this mean the court is someone independent or justice?
[2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:05.480]  Thomas is now the heart of the court.
[2:12:05.480 --> 2:12:08.480]  And I admit that he's the new he's the real Chief Justice.
[2:12:08.480 --> 2:12:09.480]  Exactly.
[2:12:09.480 --> 2:12:11.480]  He's the guy who is the spiritual leader of the court.
[2:12:11.480 --> 2:12:16.480]  And as long as he is the spiritual leader of the court, the court will go in the right direction a lot more often than not.
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:17.480]  And that's what we're seeing.
[2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:19.480]  We're seeing a robust populist independent.
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:21.480]  And the left even admits that they say impeach him.
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:22.480]  He's the leader.
[2:12:22.480 --> 2:12:25.480]  Oh, yes. I mean, that's why that's why they're in fact, what are they doing?
[2:12:25.480 --> 2:12:30.480]  They're trying to use January 6 to go after Justice Thomas by going after his wife.
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:31.480]  Which will only piss him off more.
[2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:36.480]  Great did. I mean, if they would have studied his background, they would have understood there was no chance.
[2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:38.480]  You know, great documentary about him.
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:39.480]  Great family history.
[2:12:39.480 --> 2:12:46.480]  Probably one of the few working class people to ever make it to the US Supreme Court has, you know, old independent political roots.
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:48.480]  That's right. Even average white people couldn't get in the court.
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:12:50.480]  He's a true grassroots guy.
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:51.480]  Absolutely.
[2:12:51.480 --> 2:13:00.480]  The most you could get is Hugo Black at times had populist instincts, William Douglas at times, but as a whole Vincent at times, but only a few as a whole.
[2:13:00.480 --> 2:13:02.480]  The Supreme Court has been an elitist institution.
[2:13:02.480 --> 2:13:06.480]  Thomas has broken through it with the power of his intellect and the power of his character.
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.480]  And that is reflected in the very constitutionally oriented decisions he's made.
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:18.480]  And the reaction of Democratic Party is rage and effective impotency, which they're trying to replace by just taking unilateral lawless action.
[2:13:18.480 --> 2:13:20.480]  And they're going to continue to.
[2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:22.480]  These January six cases are also part of that.
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:24.480]  So I agree.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:27.480]  I want to get a January six segment and then the tax on us that affects everybody.
[2:13:27.480 --> 2:13:38.480]  But tying this executive power grab that they're waffling on to the NDA with HR 4350 that says he's a dictator and controls domestic operations.
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:40.480]  This to me shows desperation.
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:41.480]  Oh, completely.
[2:13:41.480 --> 2:13:47.480]  And it's a sign that the anybody running for Congress should be talking about if they're going to really drain the swamp, if they're going to really drain the swamp.
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:51.480]  No more special emergency powers given to the executive branch of the government.
[2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:52.480]  We need to scrap all of these.
[2:13:52.480 --> 2:13:56.480]  The emergency power should be limited like some legislatures have done.
[2:13:56.480 --> 2:14:05.480]  Some legislators have stepped up to the plate and radically reduced the scope and scale of emergency powers of their governors in the states that got so widely misused and abused in 2020.
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:08.480]  We need that at a federal emergency power brought Hitler to power.
[2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:09.480]  Exactly.
[2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:10.480]  Absolutely.
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:15.480]  The Weimar Constitution had one fatal flaws considered the greatest constitution in the history of continental Europe.
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:18.480]  And its great failure was it included an emergency exception within it.
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:22.480]  Our forefathers had the wisdom to include no emergency exception.
[2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:23.480]  That's right.
[2:14:23.480 --> 2:14:27.480]  That's why they always say shall not be a bridge, but expanding on that.
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:35.480]  You understand as a well known constitutional lawyer, the general public may not fully get it that emergency equals dictatorship.
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:38.480]  So anytime you're hearing we have emergency powers, better look out.
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:39.480]  Absolutely.
[2:14:39.480 --> 2:14:40.480]  That's all.
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:41.480]  It's always been a threat.
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:42.480]  It's always been a danger.
[2:14:42.480 --> 2:14:47.480]  We should have been limited to 72 hours max for things that are truly an emergency.
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:50.480]  And if even then, because the reality is you could...
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:55.480]  Well, they're using nuclear war stuff from the Cold War as the pretext for this.
[2:14:55.480 --> 2:14:56.480]  That's exactly right.
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:14:57.480]  And so they're using every pre...
[2:14:57.480 --> 2:14:59.480]  Like you go back to the trilogy of infamy and what was it?
[2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:00.480]  They used public health.
[2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  They used a foreign war and the combination of those two justified taking away every...
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:11.480]  And now they're using climate and race war and economic collapse and disease.
[2:15:11.480 --> 2:15:14.480]  It's always going to be something disastrous, something dramatic, something impactful.
[2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.480]  That will be the scary, fear mongering tactic and technique to seize power.
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:20.480]  And that's all this is.
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:22.480]  And this is the biggest effort to seize power.
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.480]  AOC previewed this years ago when she was getting fake arrested yesterday.
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:32.480]  She previewed this when she talked about how we need to regulate everything in terms of the size of your home, how you paint your home.
[2:15:32.480 --> 2:15:39.480]  And she blamed the Capitol Police saying they're involved in January 6th.
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:40.480]  Exactly.
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:44.480]  And she accepted herself in the Democratic Party that was institutionally behind what took place.
[2:15:44.480 --> 2:15:49.480]  And they're fundamentally frauds, like doing fake arrest, fake migrant centers.
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:51.480]  I mean, these people just are fake.
[2:15:51.480 --> 2:16:19.480]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, we are real.
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:25.480]  We all have the same ingredients in common that is in this product.

[2:20:08.480 --> 2:20:18.480]  Go to infowarsstore.com to get 2,000 mules today.
[2:20:49.480 --> 2:20:59.480]  And I get it. You know it was a million people in D.C., maybe 1,000 went to the capitol, maybe 100 pooped on Pelosi's desk or Stolar Beer.
[2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:09.480]  Why are we all terrorists from that? They're building their whole political takeover on that to outlaw questioning elections ahead of the next stolen election in 111 days.
[2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:17.480]  But talking about Trump, and as I predicted a few weeks ago, he would say, I'm going to run. He announced last week he's going to run.
[2:21:17.480 --> 2:21:23.480]  Roger Stone talked to him, had dinner with him, I talked to MGT, a bunch of others that met with him. I mean, I don't just make this stuff up.
[2:21:23.480 --> 2:21:30.480]  I said, in July, he'll say he's running. He did. The left spun that and said it was a false prediction. Well, he didn't say when he's running.
[2:21:30.480 --> 2:21:38.480]  Well, he said I'm running 2024. So that's all happening right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:21:38.480 --> 2:21:45.480]  But the Attorney General came out last night and said, I'm not going to indict Trump before the election.
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:53.480]  I was just saying to Barnes during the break, I see that as a faint sword fight. You act like you're going this way. You go that way or a running back.
[2:21:53.480 --> 2:21:57.480]  Actually, he's going to the right. He goes to the left or vice versa. Everybody knows what a juke is.
[2:21:57.480 --> 2:22:04.480]  And so Barnes said exactly they're going to have Fulton County do it. And that's the inside baseball out of Atlanta.
[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:10.480]  And so the sooner he announces, the more it indemnifies him politically against that. I get he's got a bunch of campaign money.
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:15.480]  He wants to spend now on other things. But I think Trump should announce sooner rather than later. What's your inside baseball?
[2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:16.480]  Robert Barnes.
[2:22:16.480 --> 2:22:20.480]  So yeah, so I don't think DC will indict Trump prior to the election.
[2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:25.480]  But I do believe that he is at high risk of being indicted by the Fulton County District Attorney.
[2:22:25.480 --> 2:22:31.480]  The Fulton County, that's Atlanta. The Fulton County DA is very politically ambitious, politically ambitious, has been using this case,
[2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:36.480]  which has just been a nonsense case. I represented the president in Georgia during those election challenges.
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:40.480]  Nothing that happened was criminal. Nothing that happened that was illegal, at least by the Trump campaign.
[2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:43.480]  There might have been some illegal activities in Georgia. It just wasn't by Trump.
[2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:49.480]  So the Fulton County, which had notorious set of problems, that's where the pipes magically broke and things of this nature.
[2:22:49.480 --> 2:22:56.480]  That's where ballots magically appeared. That's where people were caught on video, pulling out ballots from underneath the table and counting them after the observers had gone.
[2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:00.480]  Where all of that took place, do you think the Fulton County DA is investigating any of that? No.
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:08.480]  Instead, the Fulton County DA is investigating Trump. And it's now escalated to the point where all of the Trump's electors, contingent electors,
[2:23:08.480 --> 2:23:16.480]  have now been put under criminal investigation. They've received formal official notice, I know several of them, that they are now targets of the grand jury.
[2:23:16.480 --> 2:23:19.480]  Why have they suddenly become targets of the special grand jury?
[2:23:19.480 --> 2:23:25.480]  Because as their pleadings that they filed in court challenging these grand jury summonses and subpoenas,
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:32.480]  fully detailed, they said they were going to come forward and testify to give exculpatory evidence to prove Trump is innocent.
[2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:36.480]  So in order to punish them for saying, for producing honest evidence of...
[2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:37.480]  But pressure.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:43.480]  Exactly. The DA came back and said, I hear by an ounce that you're now targets of the grand jury.
[2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:52.480]  And so they're going to lock up a lot of just ordinary everyday people just because they were going to serve as Trump's electors in case Trump's election contests,
[2:23:52.480 --> 2:23:57.480]  which by the way, the Georgia courts corruptly fail to ever hear.
[2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:02.480]  That election contest is supposed to be heard within five days by law. No Georgia court would hear it.
[2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:07.480]  They delayed it and delayed it and delayed it magically until when? Right after January 6th.
[2:24:07.480 --> 2:24:13.480]  They did that deliberately. Once January 6th happened, that allowed the Georgia courts to escape responsibility and accountability.
[2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:17.480]  And that election contest was never heard by the Georgia courts.
[2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:23.480]  And now to cover up all of that judicial misconduct, all of that misconduct by government state officials in Georgia,
[2:24:23.480 --> 2:24:29.480]  including by the secretary of state, Brad Ratburger, the DA in Fulton County,
[2:24:29.480 --> 2:24:36.480]  in Atlanta, overwhelmingly liberal democratic jurisdiction, is misusing and abusing her prosecutorial and grand jury powers to go after Trump.
[2:24:36.480 --> 2:24:41.480]  And the fact that she's now made the electors potential targets proves that, in fact,
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:48.480]  she intends to indict Trump probably before the election is out as a way to boost because this prosecutor is a known political ally
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:52.480]  of one Stacey Abrams, who wants to be the next governor of Georgia,
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:25:00.480]  whose political machine was instrumental in the various interesting ballots that came in during the 2020 election.
[2:25:00.480 --> 2:25:01.480]  So what does Trump do?
[2:25:01.480 --> 2:25:05.480]  If I think, I agree with you, Trump should announce sooner rather than later.
[2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:13.480]  I know there's a bunch of sort of nervous Nellies in Washington that think if Trump announces that changes the script for 2022 and hurts the Republican Party.
[2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:14.480]  Now, it supercharges it.
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:15.480]  Exactly.
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:17.480]  The base needs to turn out.
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:19.480]  Midterms are turnout elections.
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.480]  Right now, the Democratic base is completely demoralized.
[2:25:23.480 --> 2:25:25.480]  Young voters hate Joe Biden.
[2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:29.480]  Over 90% of them say he shouldn't run for reelection in 2024.
[2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:30.480]  That's young Democrats.
[2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:37.480]  The same is true for a lot of working class African-American and Latino voters very disappointed in Joe Biden have no interest in voting.
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:43.480]  So all Republicans need to do is to make sure their base, their working class base turns out to vote.
[2:25:43.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  And Trump should come out and call for the impeachment of Biden.
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:51.480]  Even though the votes aren't there, the investigation will change the subject to Hunter Biden and Barisma and the crimes and the open borders.
[2:25:51.480 --> 2:25:58.480]  Impeaching for open borders, impeaching for devaluation of the Kurds, impeaching for shutting down the energy sector, keystone pipeline,
[2:25:58.480 --> 2:26:00.480]  which is the subject going offense.
[2:26:00.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  Instead of just the Republican leadership, just, oh, let Democrats mismanage things, then they'll vote for us.
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:07.480]  They'll steal the election again, you dumbasses.
[2:26:07.480 --> 2:26:08.480]  No doubt.
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:14.480]  What Trump should do is Trump should get back on the aggressive, stay on the aggressive, not only declare his candidacy, make it clear.
[2:26:14.480 --> 2:26:17.480]  Also, that gives Trump a political edge.
[2:26:17.480 --> 2:26:20.480]  They'll have trouble indicting him.
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:32.480]  Not only that, it will also bring that when there is a wave of support of populist candidates in 2022, Trump can partially take credit for it by announcing his campaign and co-campanning.
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:33.480]  I agree.
[2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:34.480]  So who's this running mate?
[2:26:34.480 --> 2:26:36.480]  My understanding is that he's already decided.
[2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:37.480]  It's going to be DeSantis.
[2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:39.480]  DeSantis is not going to challenge or contest Trump.
[2:26:39.480 --> 2:26:40.480]  And Trump is quietly.
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:41.480]  So that's huge.
[2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:44.480]  That's what I've heard, you know, more context than I do.
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:46.480]  DeSantis is ready to get behind Trump.
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:47.480]  Oh yeah.
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:48.480]  In fact, he's already made that agreement.
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:49.480]  That agreement's already been made.
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:51.480]  So unless Trump has...
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:52.480]  We'll spend more time on that.
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:53.480]  Sure.
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:56.480]  DeSantis is a very politically savvy, smart guy.
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:26:58.480]  He knows that Trump can only run for one term.
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:00.480]  So this is a unique vice president.
[2:27:00.480 --> 2:27:01.480]  He'll be president next.
[2:27:01.480 --> 2:27:02.480]  Exactly.
[2:27:02.480 --> 2:27:03.480]  Perfect.
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:04.480]  And he would get two terms.
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:09.480]  A lot of vice presidents have difficulty getting two terms because their prior ones serve two terms consecutively.
[2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:10.480]  That's not going to happen here.
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:14.480]  So not only that, DeSantis will be given a lot of power and discretion over...
[2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:15.480]  Because Trump's old and tired.
[2:27:15.480 --> 2:27:16.480]  Exactly.
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:17.480]  Particularly in domestic policy.
[2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:18.480]  Trump's strength is his great instinct.
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:21.480]  He'll do international while DeSantis handles the country.
[2:27:21.480 --> 2:27:22.480]  Exactly.
[2:27:22.480 --> 2:27:23.480]  And that's...
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:24.480]  Perfect.
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:25.480]  I mean, part that's what he wanted Pence to do.
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:28.480]  Pence just betrayed him as we're discovering in the Burke's book and the other books.
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:31.480]  But DeSantis is a much better person.
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:33.480]  It kills two birds with one stone.
[2:27:33.480 --> 2:27:34.480]  One is he needed...
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:38.480]  Trump needed to moot in all this talk of DeSantis challenging him.
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:39.480]  Secondly...
[2:27:39.480 --> 2:27:40.480]  Oh, this hasn't hit the news yet.
[2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:41.480]  No, no, it isn't.
[2:27:41.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  It isn't public, but it will be by the time...
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:46.480]  It probably won't be fully public until the convention.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:50.480]  But the agreement is already there behind the scenes for Trump and DeSantis to run on
[2:27:50.480 --> 2:27:52.480]  the ticket in 2024.
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:55.480]  And that's why all these people talking about DeSantis challenging him totally false.
[2:27:55.480 --> 2:27:56.480]  That's totally fake news.
[2:27:56.480 --> 2:27:57.480]  Beautiful.
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:00.480]  The only way anything like that happens is if Trump has a health problem or something
[2:28:00.480 --> 2:28:01.480]  else.
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:02.480]  By the way...
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:03.480]  I'm aside myself happy right now.
[2:28:03.480 --> 2:28:04.480]  This is...
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:05.480]  Well, knowing that, DeSantis is also insurance.
[2:28:05.480 --> 2:28:09.480]  Right right now, the only reason why Trump hasn't announced this ticket is while DeSantis
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:13.480]  is out there, he's also indictment insurance for Trump because Democrats are as scared...
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:14.480]  He would win too, yeah.
[2:28:14.480 --> 2:28:15.480] ...of Trump.
[2:28:15.480 --> 2:28:16.480]  They'll be taking out Trump.
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:19.280]  We're stuck with DeSantis and maybe we get doubly whacked.
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:20.280]  So the...
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:21.480]  It provides perfect cover.
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:22.480]  Ultimately, they'll run...
[2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:24.480]  He's got to make sure they're never on the same airplane together.
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:25.480]  Yeah.
[2:28:25.480 --> 2:28:26.480]  That's exactly right.
[2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:27.480]  That's exactly right.
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:31.480]  Don't take an LBJ special trip to Dallas, Texas in November.
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:32.480]  And you might be okay.
[2:28:32.480 --> 2:28:33.480]  Well, we got to put that up front.
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:34.480]  Let's talk more about this.
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:36.480]  I know you got all the big insight connections.
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:39.480]  I've got them too, but I don't even try to work them, but I know you talked to them all.
[2:28:39.480 --> 2:28:40.480]  This is huge.
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:45.480]  A Trump DeSantis run 2024, when do they announce?

[2:30:33.480 --> 2:30:36.480]  best with our supplements as well.
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.480]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:40.480]  Folks, this is a joke.
[2:30:40.480 --> 2:30:42.480]  I'm putting this thing away.
[2:30:42.480 --> 2:30:43.480]  It's 75% off.
[2:30:43.480 --> 2:30:44.480]  By the way, it works for me.
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:49.480]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:51.480]  Quite well, I might add.
[2:30:51.480 --> 2:30:55.480]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:30:57.480]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:30:57.480 --> 2:31:01.480]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[2:31:01.480 --> 2:31:03.480]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:08.480]  I got to tell you, infowords is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[2:31:08.480 --> 2:31:12.480]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with, and
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:18.480]  we said, what are the best-selling natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:19.480]  are out there?
[2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:24.480]  We went and looked at the top 10, and they all had the same ingredients in common that
[2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:25.480]  is in this product.
[2:31:25.480 --> 2:31:32.480]  But with our new product from X7 Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these

[2:32:19.480 --> 2:32:21.480]  is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:26.480]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:28.480]  shortages, and it's happened just like clockwork.
[2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:31.480]  And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.
[2:32:31.480 --> 2:32:32.480]  They have designed this.
[2:32:32.480 --> 2:32:38.480]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[2:32:55.480 --> 2:33:05.480]  Take action.
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:39.480]  And Robert Barnes has a lot of inside sources.
[2:33:39.480 --> 2:33:42.480]  He told me the sources that are right there at the top.
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:47.480]  And months ago, I'd already heard rumblings of this, but I'd ask Barnes about it.
[2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:54.480]  The decision has been made for tactical reasons or for tactical flexibilities.
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:58.480]  But right now, Trump and DeSantis are planning to run.
[2:33:58.480 --> 2:34:02.480]  Trump said last week, as we told you weeks before, he's going to run.
[2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:05.480]  The announcement hasn't been made yet, but he says he is running.
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:07.480]  So that's another prediction we made that is accurate.
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:09.480]  Robert Barnes, flesh this out.
[2:34:09.480 --> 2:34:10.480]  Take some time.
[2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:12.480]  Without giving out your sources, what's about to happen?
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:13.480]  Sure.
[2:34:13.480 --> 2:34:17.480]  So the agreement's already there for 2024 to be a Trump DeSantis ticket.
[2:34:17.480 --> 2:34:22.480]  DeSantis knows that Trump can only serve one term so that he would be in a position to
[2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:24.480]  have two terms himself come 2028.
[2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:27.480]  It perfectly aligns for what DeSantis wants to achieve.
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:29.480]  It also aligns with what Trump wants to achieve.
[2:34:29.480 --> 2:34:33.480]  The second aspect of this Trump DeSantis ticket would be how they govern.
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:38.480]  That DeSantis would be given a lot of authority over domestic issues and domestic aspects,
[2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:40.480]  because that isn't where Trump's focus is.
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:45.480]  Trump's focus is on international relations, of defeating globalist and globalism,
[2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:49.480]  of restoring peace and prosperity around the world and at home.
[2:34:49.480 --> 2:34:52.480]  And that is where his instincts and skill set excel.
[2:34:52.480 --> 2:34:56.480]  It's the one place where DeSantis is frankly kind of weak and unknown at this point.
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:00.480]  So it perfectly aligns with both of their institutional interests, their individual interests,
[2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:03.480]  their political interests, their ideological interests.
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:05.480]  And so that agreement is already there.
[2:35:05.480 --> 2:35:07.480]  It won't be announced until much later.
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:11.480]  And the reason for that is DeSantis is indictment insurance for Trump,
[2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:17.480]  because Democrats are terrified of a DeSantis candidacy as much as they are terrified of a Trump candidacy.
[2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:20.480]  And consequently, they know if they can't take out DeSantis,
[2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:23.480]  then they're not going to try to take out Trump at a federal indictment level.
[2:35:23.480 --> 2:35:27.480]  And that's the real reason they're not going to indict Trump federally.
[2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:30.480]  That won't stop Trump from having to face the Fulton County DA
[2:35:30.480 --> 2:35:34.480]  and that politically ambitious individual who wants to influence the 2022 election
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:38.480]  to help swing it to Stacey Abrams and her political machine in Georgia.
[2:35:38.480 --> 2:35:42.480]  But it will provide insurance for Trump going forward to 2024.
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:49.480]  And a Trump DeSantis 2024 ticket is by all of the polling that I have seen unbeatable at this point
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:52.480]  and is likely to be unbeatable come November of 2024.
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.480]  So should Trump declare sooner rather than later?
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:35:59.480]  And then what are the wild cards we've got to watch out for?
[2:35:59.480 --> 2:36:05.480]  So I think Trump should wait to declare anything about DeSantis until the 2024 campaign officially and formally.
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:08.480]  But you'll see signs for this and then they're doing joint events.
[2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:12.480]  You'll see more and more of these joint events just sort of magically accidentally pop up.
[2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:16.480]  So you'll see that there is sort of a natural symbiosis between them,
[2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:21.480]  a natural affinity between them on the stage that's real that was never there for Mike Pence.
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:26.480]  That you'll see that this is legit, this is honest, this is a true team effort.
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:28.480]  But you won't see a formalized announcement.
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:34.480]  But what Trump should do in terms of his own individual campaign announcement is announce it sooner rather than later.
[2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:37.480]  Maybe announce it right after Labor Day, fully announce he's going to be running,
[2:36:37.480 --> 2:36:40.480]  he's going to be campaigning for the presidency in 2024,
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:43.480]  put maximum pressure on them not to indict him anywhere,
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.480]  or it will look like it's a politically motivated indictment,
[2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:53.480]  and help get the benefit by generating maximum turnout of the working class Republican base
[2:36:53.480 --> 2:36:59.480]  that will help a lot of populists like J.D. Vance and Blake Masters and Eric Reitens and Joe Kent
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:04.480]  and others get elected to the House and Senate in 2022 so that there's a real populist base
[2:37:04.480 --> 2:37:09.480]  when he gets elected in 2024 to translate that into real policy come 2025.
[2:37:09.480 --> 2:37:12.480]  What about the sort of Damocles election fraud?
[2:37:12.480 --> 2:37:15.480]  They're trying new lockdowns. I covered it last hour.
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:18.480]  They're getting ready for more mail-in ballots. How do we deal with something like that?
[2:37:18.480 --> 2:37:21.480]  Two things. One is the court of public opinion is still critical,
[2:37:21.480 --> 2:37:25.480]  but there's already been meaningful legislative reforms passed in Arizona,
[2:37:25.480 --> 2:37:27.480]  meaningful legislative reforms passed in Georgia.
[2:37:27.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  Florida is already a great state for election integrity laws.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.480]  Wisconsin of all places.
[2:37:33.480 --> 2:37:36.480]  But Wisconsin, because the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Wisconsin,
[2:37:36.480 --> 2:37:40.480]  they won't be able to repeat what they did in 2020 and 2022.
[2:37:40.480 --> 2:37:44.480]  The states to watch out for are going to be Pennsylvania, going to be Michigan.
[2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:47.480]  You look at Michigan, they've kicked a bunch of candidates off the ballot for governor.
[2:37:47.480 --> 2:37:51.480]  They've indicted another candidate for governor on bogus January 6th charges
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:54.480]  that are meant to prevent him from being able to defeat Whitmer.
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:58.480]  Remember, Whitmer is the one that they conjured up that entire entrapment plot.
[2:37:58.480 --> 2:38:01.480]  Don't have to take my word for it. That was what a jury of 12 people can do.
[2:38:01.480 --> 2:38:03.480]  The FBI team at that stage, January 6th.
[2:38:03.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  Exactly. Not only that, the FBI man in charge in Detroit of that inquiring investigation,
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:13.480]  after they pulled that off in late October to influence the Michigan election
[2:38:13.480 --> 2:38:18.480]  in favor of not only Whitmer's public opinion, but for Biden against Trump,
[2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:23.480]  was then immediately transferred to where the District of Columbia.
[2:38:23.480 --> 2:38:27.480]  So that's not a coincidence. You can see the, as Darren Beatty of Revolver News
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:30.480]  and Julie Kelly at American Greatness have both detailed,
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:33.480]  there's extraordinary overlap in the template.
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:35.480]  Oh, there is. We know what happens. So let me ask you this.
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:39.480]  We're going to break out some really big news dealing with the courts.
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:43.480]  Next segment, people need to hear the big announcement.
[2:38:43.480 --> 2:38:45.480]  They're losing, they're falling apart.
[2:38:45.480 --> 2:38:51.480]  I don't want to be overconfident like the Wolf says in, you know, that famous, you know,
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:56.480]  film dealing with Pulp Fiction and the whole mafia.
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:38:59.480]  Let's not start sucking each other's ding-dongs yet.
[2:38:59.480 --> 2:39:01.480]  How do you see them countering that?
[2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:06.480]  And how does the whole January 6 thing tie into that and the ban and trial and all of it?
[2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:08.480]  I think what you're going to see is a three-fold attack.
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:12.480]  One is you're going to have to worry about emergency powers being used and asserted on some pretext.
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:16.480]  And the Biden administration, as Julie Kelly has detailed on Tucker and elsewhere,
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:23.480]  wants to actually federalize the elections using the emergency powers under the executive branch as well.
[2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:28.480]  So that what they're doing with climate powers simply going to be a template for what they're going to try.
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:29.480]  It's all desperate flailing.
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:30.480]  Absolutely.
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:31.480]  Complete.
[2:39:31.480 --> 2:39:34.480]  You're going to have desperate emergency actions declared, desperate actions involving misuse
[2:39:34.480 --> 2:39:37.480]  and abuse of the judicial process, the courts and their property.
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:38.480]  But that's not power.
[2:39:38.480 --> 2:39:39.480]  That's flailing.
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:40.480]  That is flailing.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:41.480]  But you're going to have to watch out for.
[2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:46.480]  I mean, you're going to have to stay hyperalert because the risk of a false flag event,
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:50.480]  the risk of some staged event, the risk of some overdramatized event,
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:55.480]  meant to give the basis to emergency power so that they can try to rig the election outcome
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:39:57.480]  is going to be off the charts come November.
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:39:58.480]  I agree.
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:01.480]  As they get more desperate in the next 111 days.
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:02.480]  No doubt.
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:05.480]  In fact, I mean, I'm sure they would like to put foot actual soldiers on the ground,
[2:40:05.480 --> 2:40:08.480]  feet on the ground in Ukraine to help create a.
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:09.480]  Oh, yeah.
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:10.480]  The Pentagon's saying they're like going to war with Russia.
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:11.480]  And they would like.
[2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:12.480]  So that's the real threat is war with Russia.
[2:40:12.480 --> 2:40:13.480]  Yeah.
[2:40:13.480 --> 2:40:17.480]  Try to provoke Russia to do something that we could justify in the minds of the West putting
[2:40:17.480 --> 2:40:22.480]  US troops on the ground in Ukraine to distract everybody from all the other conversations and topics.
[2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:25.480]  How do we know Putin's not working with Biden who he owns and controls?
[2:40:25.480 --> 2:40:28.480]  And Putin's making record money off oil.
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:29.480]  The rubles way up.
[2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:31.480]  I mean, Biden's helping Putin.
[2:40:31.480 --> 2:40:35.480]  He effectively he is, but the globalists all thought they were going to beat him.
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:39.480]  George Soros and Putin have been waging war against each other really for 30 years publicly
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:40.480]  for now.
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:41.480]  That's a real war for sure.
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:42.480]  Yeah.
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:43.480]  And so they really.
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:47.480]  So why would Biden do policies that help put there just that they just gambled wrong.
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:50.480]  They really believe that if they printed the money, they had the power.
[2:40:50.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  They control the financial system.
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:53.480]  The Putin said, I got the resources.
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:54.480]  Exactly.
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:55.480]  People need that.
[2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:56.480]  Now they're just buying it from him.
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.480]  In fact, that was his premise in 1997 wrote that we talked about before that little essay
[2:41:00.480 --> 2:41:04.480]  he wrote when he was an economics grad student in between jobs before he was prime minister,
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:08.480]  where he said real powers, food and fuel, not just a little dollar.
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:09.480]  That's what he said.
[2:41:09.480 --> 2:41:11.480]  We're about energy and food.
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:12.480]  Yes.
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:13.480]  And it worked.
[2:41:13.480 --> 2:41:14.480]  I mean, his whole premise was.
[2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:15.480]  Well, yeah, money's fake.
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:16.480]  Energy and food's real.
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:17.480]  Exactly.
[2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:18.480]  But that's what Biden didn't know.
[2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:19.480]  That's what George Soros didn't know.
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:20.480]  That's what all the globalists didn't know.
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:22.480]  They had convinced themselves of their own.
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:29.480]  Everybody's buying Russian oil, including the U.S., fenced through India, and Biden's announcing
[2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:30.480]  our oil scoff.
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:31.480]  Yeah.
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:32.480]  Exactly.
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:35.480]  And it's domestic insanity on the part of the Biden administration.
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:37.480]  And they're because they're stuck.
[2:41:37.480 --> 2:41:38.480]  They're stuck.
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  And so they lost to the Supreme Court.
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:43.480]  They have a leftist instinct to hurt Americans, even though if they just get behind this,
[2:41:43.480 --> 2:41:45.480]  we might have marched a war with them, which I wouldn't want to do.
[2:41:45.480 --> 2:41:49.480]  If they'd just pat us on the head, but they hate us so much, they can't even energize their
[2:41:49.480 --> 2:41:51.480]  own base to fight a foreign enemy.
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:52.480]  They're idiots.
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  No, really.
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:54.480]  And the incompetency is there.
[2:41:54.480 --> 2:41:57.480]  You know, it's what happens when you have six generations of intellectual incest.
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:41:59.480]  And that's basically what we have with the intellectual elite.
[2:41:59.480 --> 2:42:03.480]  We have, like, the end of the Egyptian Empire, the end of the Habsburg Empire.
[2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:07.480]  We've got multiple generations of people who are intellectually incapable of making good
[2:42:07.480 --> 2:42:08.480]  decisions.
[2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:11.480]  The only thing they're capable of is making dangerous decisions.
[2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:12.480]  That's right.
[2:42:12.480 --> 2:42:13.480]  All these ass-kissers under them.
[2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:14.480]  Oh, completely.
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:15.480]  Subordinates.
[2:42:15.480 --> 2:42:16.480]  People that have no clue.
[2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:17.480]  I mean, you go to the Ivy League today.
[2:42:17.480 --> 2:42:18.480]  These are not people you would pick.
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:22.480]  They're not thinking about the policy or the issue, just how to kiss ass.
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:23.480]  Yes.
[2:42:23.480 --> 2:42:24.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:25.480]  And what's the latest?
[2:42:25.480 --> 2:42:26.480]  What's the next day?
[2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:27.480]  What's the day after that?
[2:42:27.480 --> 2:42:28.480]  They're not thinking long term.
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:29.480]  They don't have strategic skill sets.
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:31.480]  They don't understand the real world.
[2:42:31.480 --> 2:42:32.480]  They don't understand real economics.
[2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:34.480]  They don't understand real power.
[2:42:34.480 --> 2:42:38.480]  So all that does me is make them dangerous, but it doesn't make them capable of making
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:39.480]  decisions that are actually in their own long term.
[2:42:39.480 --> 2:42:40.480]  No, I agree.
[2:42:40.480 --> 2:42:42.480]  And that's even more dangerous and common to people.
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  All right, we're going to come back and hit stuff that, folks, you want to talk about
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:48.480]  America?
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:51.480]  We've got stuff that is the worst thing in our 250-year history.
[2:42:51.480 --> 2:42:52.480]  Straight ahead.
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:53.480]  This has got to be exposed.
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:54.480]  Stay with us.
[2:42:54.480 --> 2:43:03.480]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to
[2:43:03.480 --> 2:43:05.480]  annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:11.480]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:15.480]  that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:17.480]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:43:17.480 --> 2:43:21.480]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us at one
[2:43:21.480 --> 2:43:23.480]  point or another, too, that's just the truth.
[2:43:23.480 --> 2:43:25.480]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.
[2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:30.480]  But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis, InstaHeart is the

[2:43:56.480 --> 2:44:01.480]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds overweight.
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:03.480]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[2:44:03.480 --> 2:44:05.480]  I was barely holding on to a job.
[2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:08.480]  And I heard Dr. Group on their show and I listened to it.
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:11.480]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:12.480]  And it worked pretty good.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:14.480]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with that stew.
[2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:17.480]  You had, you know, with a deep burn source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:18.480]  So I took it.
[2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:24.480]  And man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:26.480]  You know, I could think again.
[2:44:26.480 --> 2:44:28.480]  I could connect with people again.
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:32.480]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously
[2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:34.480]  take basically all of your supplements.
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:36.480]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[2:44:36.480 --> 2:44:38.480]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:40.480]  Literally, like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[2:44:40.480 --> 2:44:41.480]  It's amazing.
[2:44:41.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  It works.
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:44.480]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[2:44:44.480 --> 2:44:46.480]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.480]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:51.480]  Beautifully said, brother.
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:54.480]  I thank you so much for your call at Godspeed.
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:01.480]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world.
[2:45:01.480 --> 2:45:09.480]  The civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats.
[2:45:09.480 --> 2:45:10.480]  It goes on and on.
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:13.480]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[2:45:13.480 --> 2:45:16.480]  But it's been so successful now.
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:25.480]  We're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.
[2:45:25.480 --> 2:45:29.480]  And it's exclusively available at the bio pros dot com.
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:31.480]  And now info or store dot com.

[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:09.480]  And listen, there are hundreds of them out there that work, but most of them do it in a toxic way.

[2:46:51.480 --> 2:46:56.480]  I can't wait for the reviews. It's worked great for me.
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:40.480]  If you're ready, a listener, if you're blessed, you're going to have to look at this disgusting place over for Obama's third stolen term.
[2:47:40.480 --> 2:47:53.480]  Biden is at a dirty beach covered with garbage announcing his dictatorial power grab. They already put a new press release out 10 minutes ago.
[2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:59.480]  I've got here saying, oh, he's not going to announce the emergency yet because he knows everybody's going to challenge it.
[2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:02.480]  So they already announced it in this document, but now they're not going to do it.
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:09.480]  We'll cover it more next hour. Robert Barnes is here with us. You just saw those images of him in front of garbage.
[2:48:09.480 --> 2:48:15.480]  Yeah, it's a sign of bad visual imagery, by the way. I mean, I get the idea that they want to say they're setting him up.
[2:48:15.480 --> 2:48:22.480]  Oh, yeah. And that'll be the question. That'll be the real thing to watch for if the deep state is serious about trying to fix its problems.
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:25.480]  Replacing Biden is part of it. It's just Harris is not a viable one.
[2:48:25.480 --> 2:48:32.480]  And the favorite deep state candidate within the cabinet is actually Pete Buttigieg or boot, boot ed edge or however you pronounce his name.
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:39.480]  So he was always the deep state favorite and even more so than Harris. Harris was originally picked and they shifted to him.
[2:48:39.480 --> 2:48:47.480]  So if you see some movement to take Harris out and replace Harris with Buttigieg, then Biden will be DOA politically very soon thereafter.
[2:48:47.480 --> 2:48:50.480]  That's what all the talk and I agree with you, which you mentioned earlier.
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:54.480]  Trump should continue to highlight the Biden corruption scandals.
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:49:02.480]  Not only call for a House investigation and impeachment of Biden, but also call for a special counsel's appointment.
[2:49:02.480 --> 2:49:08.480]  You know, that's what they did to Trump. Well, just return the favor. There needs to be an independent special counsel to investigate.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  Republicans won't change the subject. They just sit there and let the Democrats create the narrative.
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:14.480]  Yes. And why do they do that?
[2:49:14.480 --> 2:49:19.480]  That's because so many of them don't want. I mean, we're still going to have the most populous Congress ever come 2023,
[2:49:19.480 --> 2:49:30.480]  but it will not be a majority of the Congress. And that's because people like Kevin McCarthy has gone around trying to basically remove or defeat populous candidates for the House and the Senate.
[2:49:30.480 --> 2:49:37.480]  Now they failed in trying to take out J.D. Vance. They're failing in trying to take out Blake Masters. They're failing in trying to take out Joe Kent.
[2:49:37.480 --> 2:49:44.480]  They failed in their efforts against Lauren Bobert. They failed in their efforts against Paul Gosar. They failed in their efforts against Madison.
[2:49:44.480 --> 2:49:53.480]  And Marjorie Taylor Greene. But they did, it worked against only one Madison Cothorn. So all the rest they lost against, but they don't want a populous Congress.
[2:49:53.480 --> 2:49:56.480]  Kevin McCarthy is part of the old Paul Ryan political establishment.
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:03.480]  That's right. They're part of the elites. All right, let's hit this big story. We'll cover it more in the coming days. This story is exclusively at infowars.com.
[2:50:03.480 --> 2:50:12.480]  You need to send it out to everyone you know. I'm going to send it to Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan today and so many others, because this attack is an attack on you.
[2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:21.480]  It's a very short press release with links to the documents at infowars.com. Now listen to this and we have the actual ruling.
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:31.480]  Hold on to your horses. Legal bomb show. Leftist judges in Connecticut and Texas rule. Alex Jones may not discuss the First Amendment.
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  Say he is innocent or claim the court case is rigged, though they do it by their own action.
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  It's a legal press release for infowars. Alex Jones breaks down how unprecedented moves by judges remove fundamental fairness and destroy constitutional right to do process.
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:51:00.480]  Effectively, the judges have ruled that Alex Jones is guilty before proven guilty and will instruct the jury to determine just how guilty he is.
[2:51:00.480 --> 2:51:14.480]  In unprecedented assault on due process, the rule of law both Texas and Connecticut judges have ruled that Alex Jones may not discuss the First Amendment, defend his innocence or point out rigged elements of the upcoming Sandy Hook defamation cases against him.
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:24.480]  Here is a limited breakdown of just some of the most egregious constitutional violations of due process of the First Amendment as explained by third party legal advisors.
[2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:35.480]  And then we have links directly to the documents. We have been denied our fundamental constitutional due process right to present a defense in Texas, Connecticut.
[2:51:35.480 --> 2:51:45.480]  Both Judge Guerra Gamble, Democrat Texas and Judge Barbara Bellis have stripped you of your First Amendment rights for allegedly filling to provide enough discovery.
[2:51:45.480 --> 2:51:50.480]  Neither judge can deny that you responded to discovery. They just rule that it's insufficient.
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:59.480]  The effect of these rulings incredibly is that you have been found guilty by two judges who've never even held trials or heard any evidence.
[2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:14.480]  Additionally, since finding you guilty without listening to your evidence, Judge Guerra Gamble has repeatedly sanctioned you over millions of dollars, monetarily for exactly the same thing she has already sanctioned you for declaring you guilty.
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:25.480]  And it continues. The advisor stated, Judge Guerra Gamble has largely agreed that Alex Jones lawyers should be gagged during the Alex Jones trial from.
[2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:32.480]  I'm going to show you the document in a moment. This is from the document. References claiming the protection of the First Amendment.
[2:52:32.480 --> 2:52:47.480]  That's bang the First Amendment this judge has done. The judgment of this court has found that defendants liable for defamation and the IED as such their speech was accountable as a matter of law, meaning the First Amendment did not protect their conduct.
[2:52:47.480 --> 2:52:54.480]  Thus, the First Amendment is irrelevant to any issue to be decided by the jury. So she finds me guilty in our jury and says you can't mention this.
[2:52:54.480 --> 2:53:03.480]  References claiming First Amendment protection or right to free speech will be prejudice to jury by falsely implying that the jury is tasked with validating the right.
[2:53:03.480 --> 2:53:12.480]  Number two, arguing the trial is in any way unfair or unjust. Don't say it gets worse. I can't say I'm innocent.
[2:53:12.480 --> 2:53:27.480]  Imagine you're in a trial. I can't say you're innocent. References implying the trial is unfair and unjust. Given recent statements by Mr. Jones and deposition and the show plaintiff's participant, Mr. Jones, on its attorneys will argue variations the following.
[2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:46.480]  The trial is unfair, unjust, rigged or stacked decked, a show trial, a kangaroo court or other similar expressions. The court acted improperly in granting a default or plaintiffs are acting improperly in moving for a default. They told my lawyers Friday, you will not mention he's even paid millions in fines.
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:54:01.480]  You will not mention that he's already been found guilty. Man, talk about keeping the jury in a slave box. Mr. Jones has denied his constitutional right by jury. I've been denied that. We're barred from telling him that.
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:10.480]  In a hearing where we're already guilty. And he says references are irrelevant, presidential and the court should prohibit such statements in front of the jury.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:23.480]  The judge put the sentence in order, arguing his innocence. You cannot at trial argue your innocence. The basis of America, but even in North Korea, you can say that you will not say you're innocent.
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:29.480]  I mean, I can't even make this up. Finally, the court representatives reviewed numbers.
[2:54:29.480 --> 2:54:44.480]  Produced documents relating to the net worth. They just said where's this document didn't exist. Despite multiple requests for the plaintiff's defendants refused to produce the documents for all these reasons, the sentence should be precluded from offering evidence or argument.
[2:54:44.480 --> 2:54:54.480]  Wow. And it goes on from there. I can't talk about the First Amendment. I can't say I'm innocent and I can't say that's a fraud. Robert Barnes.
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  It's a trial that is a joke and has made a joke of the American justice system. It is the justice system that is on trial in the Alex Jones cases, not Alex Jones, because the justice system and the verdict so far is in and it's guilty.
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:16.480]  It's of the justice system. Complete denial of the right of First Amendment freedom of expression. Complete denial of the First Amendment right of the freedom of the press. Complete denial of your Second Amendment self defense rights.
[2:55:16.480 --> 2:55:28.480]  And in this case, First Amendment speaking about Second Amendment is what this whole case is about. They want to suppress and censor any information that questions and challenges any event that doesn't blame a gun for a shooting.
[2:55:28.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  If it blames the person. In fact, one of the US history has this ever happened. There is no parallel to this kind of case. This would make Kim Jong-un blush.
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:49.480]  Oh, completely. I mean, even Stalin would feel embarrassed by this. Castro would feel embarrassed by this because it makes a complete and utter mockery of what makes America great, which is the rule of law and trial by jury.
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:52.480]  And trial by jury means trial by jury.
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:55:58.480]  So we're having a jury trial. You're guilty. You can't say we already said you're guilty. You have no defenses. You can't say you're innocent.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:05.480]  Exactly. Not only that, you have to pretend that the plaintiff's injuries don't come from the shooter because what the other thing...
[2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:08.480]  Yeah, they say that. They say it's not out of them lands. It's you.
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:19.480]  Exactly. The lawyers are not even allowed to point out that the mental anguish of the plaintiffs might have something to do with the death of their children from the shooter.
[2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:27.480]  And by the way, crew, I had the print officer. They're not here. Can you go to the actual article at m4works.com and just click on the exhibits?
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:36.480]  We have the court ruling. I mean, I was telling a bunch of famous talk show hosts about this and people, and they're all on it now. They didn't believe me until I sent it to them.
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:42.480]  So can we show the article? We have exhibits and the link. Those quotes are them, not me.
[2:56:42.480 --> 2:56:44.480]  Yeah, it's insane. I mean, it goes further.
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:46.480]  m4works.com, guys.
[2:56:46.480 --> 2:56:56.480]  And people will be able to find out next week. Let's see what the judge does. But right now, the judge has made clear because the first Sandy Hook trial starts next week, another one after that, another one in September.
[2:56:56.480 --> 2:57:08.480]  And you look at what they're talking about doing is also prohibiting any mention because this is now just the damages trial, but you're not allowed to even present evidence as to what the damages actually are or are not.
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:15.480]  Let me just do this. They're not going to have it for whatever reason. They're not linking to the article. Guys, reprint me the two court orders.
[2:57:15.480 --> 2:57:20.480]  Because we have screenshots of it, but I want you guys to click in the article to the court order.
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:29.480]  Because what you're going to find where it is. Look at that. I mean, we're not making this up. It says no First Amendment. You can't say you're innocent.
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:34.480]  I mean, that I was an axe murderer. I could say I was innocent. Well, these people are completely out of their minds.
[2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:40.480]  And this is compounding everything that's been taking place because you've already been denied your right to bring emotion.
[2:57:40.480 --> 2:57:44.480]  Hold on. Let's talk about it when we come back. I just, I mean, this is insane.
[2:57:44.480 --> 2:57:56.480]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:05.480]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[2:58:05.480 --> 2:58:13.480]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen. And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one point, another two, that's just the truth.
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:19.480]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true. But whether you rarely have any issues or have them on a regular basis,

[2:59:41.480 --> 3:00:06.480]  InfowarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[3:00:06.480 --> 3:00:15.480]  Okay, I'm bringing the documents please. Why on earth, in Connecticut and in Texas, they say we're guilty until proven innocent, now guilty until proven guilty,
[3:00:15.480 --> 3:00:24.480]  and say in court rulings in Texas, you can't say you're innocent, you can't say there's a First Amendment, you can't say it's a kangaroo court.
[3:00:24.480 --> 3:00:33.480]  I mean, that's like cartoon level. Robert Barnes, here's documents, the press release is on Infowars.com. Give us your take on why they're doing this.
[3:00:33.480 --> 3:00:39.480]  I think from the day one, the media narrative and the legal narrative about this case has been false.
[3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:45.480]  So the narrative was to tell a certain story, to script a particular tale, and as the app helped, it was clear that that media narrative was fake,
[3:00:45.480 --> 3:00:52.480]  that media narrative was false, blaming Alex Jones for things that Alex Jones had nothing to do with, blaming Infowars for things Infowars had nothing to do with,
[3:00:52.480 --> 3:01:00.480]  and often misstating and exaggerating what claims they did have, and misallocating responsibility where it didn't belong, and ignoring where it did belong.
[3:01:00.480 --> 3:01:04.480]  So the question became, what do you do when you don't really have a case?
[3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:12.480]  Well, you make up the evidence, or you claim the evidence disappeared. You claim the evidence existed but has been destroyed by the other side.
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:18.480]  You have to claim that because your evidence was never there. The evidence never supported your claims.
[3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:26.480]  And so for that reason, the courts basically, once I believe the courts realize that the case had no merit, again, if they believe these cases had real merit,
[3:01:26.480 --> 3:01:33.480]  they would allow a trial by jury on all the relevant facts and defenses. The fact that they are not allowing that to happen.
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:38.480]  Not only that, they're not allowing the legal merits to be tested meaningfully.
[3:01:38.480 --> 3:01:47.480]  Alex was denied all of his rights to bring motions to dismiss, all of his rights to bring any slap motions, all of his rights to bring summary judgment motions,
[3:01:47.480 --> 3:01:53.480]  all of his rights to bring meaningful pretrial motions. So they were afraid of a trial on the merits of the law.
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:02:02.480]  They were afraid of a trial on the merits of the facts. Why? Because neither the law nor the facts support their case, support their narrative.
[3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:09.480]  So they prescripted this case. They needed to finish in a certain way. So they're rigging the game to get that.
[3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:17.480]  That's why you have this extraordinary, exceptional, unparalleled example of a case where a person is not allowed to bring motions,
[3:02:17.480 --> 3:02:23.480]  not allowed to challenge their guilt, not allowed to challenge what actually caused injury to the other party,
[3:02:23.480 --> 3:02:32.480]  not allowed to explain and provide exculpatory material and information, not allowed to present anything other than your guilty.
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:38.480]  And the only question is how guilty? And you're not allowed to present the evidence of your innocence, not even allowed to talk about it,
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:42.480]  not even allowed to present what really caused injury, not even allowed to ask questions about it.
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:51.480]  You're not allowed to even present argument concerning it. They had to rig the outcome because their prescripted design and prescripted story was never true.
[3:02:51.480 --> 3:02:59.480]  So they're trying to script this fake narrative by ramming it into the system, by keeping the jury in the dark about core facts and key issues,
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:01.480]  pertinent and relevant material to this case.
[3:03:01.480 --> 3:03:03.480]  That shows total desperation.
[3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:14.480]  Completely. It shows if they believed they had any merit to their case, they would be eager for an Austin Liberal Democratic jury to conclude so.
[3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:18.480]  They would be eager for a Connecticut Liberal Democratic jury to conclude so.
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:23.480]  Instead, they're not allowing the jury to even hear evidence of innocence.
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:27.480]  They're not even allowed the jury to even hear arguments about innocence.
[3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:33.480]  It's just like the January 6th show trial, but I mean, this cut and dry, you have no First Amendment. You are guilty.
[3:03:33.480 --> 3:03:37.480]  You will not say we're a show trial. I mean, it's like cartoonish.
[3:03:37.480 --> 3:03:42.480]  If you even made some fantasy trial of crazy corrupt judges, you couldn't come up with this.
[3:03:42.480 --> 3:03:52.480]  Even Soviet style show trials would at least have some impression or perception of fairness or impartiality or some capacity to speak to your innocence.
[3:03:52.480 --> 3:03:58.480]  So that's how severe this is. This is the jury's not allowed to hear any evidence.
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:01.480]  And she did a million and a half dollars of fines.
[3:04:01.480 --> 3:04:08.480]  Oh, yeah. I mean, she's already basically given the plaintiffs more money than the plaintiffs than a jury would normally award them.
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:11.480]  She's already done that. Basically helped fund their litigation.
[3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:14.480]  And the plaintiff's lawyers have been open and overt.
[3:04:14.480 --> 3:04:17.480]  All over TV, everywhere saying our job is shut him down.
[3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:21.480]  Oh, and they've been very overt about how political this case is.
[3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:26.480]  I'm not talking about whether this is a limited issue of a discreet question of what happened on a particular day.
[3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:28.480]  No, no, they're saying this is about broad politics.
[3:04:28.480 --> 3:04:31.480]  And clearly the objective is to shut down Alex.
[3:04:31.480 --> 3:04:34.480]  Robert Barnes, you're on fire. This is a raping of the First Amendment.
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:39.480]  When I'm in trial next Wednesday for pre-trial statements or opening statements, you'll be hosting the show Wednesday.
[3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:41.480]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[3:04:41.480 --> 3:04:44.480]  You're going to be on all over the shows. You're in Austin the next two weeks.
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:48.480]  You'll be on the American Journal here at Smith. I'll enjoy your all of it. Thank you, Robert Barnes.
[3:04:48.480 --> 3:04:52.480]  Absolutely. And remember, everybody, you're the front line they haven't been able to get through.
[3:04:52.480 --> 3:04:56.480]  By continuing to support Infowars.com is what's really stopping.
[3:04:56.480 --> 3:05:01.480]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S.
[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:08.480]  that supplies the highest quality signature-reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government agencies.
[3:05:08.480 --> 3:05:16.480]  And now they have produced specifically for us this made America onion line at a very affordable price.
[3:05:16.480 --> 3:05:22.480]  Whether it's small pouches that protect your cell phone or big pouches that protect laptops and iPads
[3:05:22.480 --> 3:05:27.480]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics you want to put in it like desktop computers,
[3:05:27.480 --> 3:05:33.480]  it is all exclusively available at Infowars.com under the Redux name.
[3:05:33.480 --> 3:05:40.480]  Redux is Infowars, taking the highest quality products and bringing them directly to you at Infowars.com.
[3:05:40.480 --> 3:05:46.480]  In this insane world, you are crazy if you don't protect your signature, your identity,
[3:05:46.480 --> 3:05:50.480]  from identity theft, hackers, criminals, corporations, governments.
[3:05:50.480 --> 3:06:11.480]  This is one of the hottest items out there today that's exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com.
[3:06:11.480 --> 3:06:16.480]  All right, the great Kate Daly's got a big guest about to take over here in just a few minutes.
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:19.480]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[3:06:19.480 --> 3:06:25.480]  So we just showed you the court documents from Connecticut and Texas who are all in sync.
[3:06:25.480 --> 3:06:31.480]  The Texas judge makes rulings before the lawyers on the other side even file.
[3:06:31.480 --> 3:06:36.480]  It's all rigged saying no First Amendment, you're already guilty, you can't defend yourself.
[3:06:36.480 --> 3:06:40.480]  You can't talk, you can't say you're innocent.
[3:06:40.480 --> 3:06:43.480]  No First Amendment.
[3:06:43.480 --> 3:06:45.480]  But that's what's happening to all of America.
[3:06:45.480 --> 3:06:47.480]  We're being raped by the globalists.
[3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:53.480]  I expect being the tip of the spear to have these people come after us and they are going to win,
[3:06:53.480 --> 3:06:59.480]  but it takes money to keep the show broadcasting and it takes money to fight these monsters
[3:06:59.480 --> 3:07:04.480]  and we are still in the fight but barely.
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:06.480]  And I will continue to fight no matter what happens.
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:10.480]  But I got to tell you, we are in a very serious position.
[3:07:10.480 --> 3:07:16.480]  Since I begged for support in the last few days, we've got enough money to almost push us into the black.
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:19.480]  Plus we have great products, you all need.
[3:07:19.480 --> 3:07:24.480]  Info Wars is listened to by all of the most informative people out there, the big names.
[3:07:24.480 --> 3:07:28.480]  We are blessed to be in the zeitgeist thanks to your prayer and your support
[3:07:28.480 --> 3:07:30.480]  and we need your support now more than ever.
[3:07:30.480 --> 3:07:34.480]  So I won't back down, I won't give up, but I could give out.
[3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:38.480]  A horse will run and run and run until it has a heart attack.
[3:07:38.480 --> 3:07:40.480]  We don't want to go to that point.
[3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:43.480]  Keep being the fight please.
[3:07:43.480 --> 3:07:49.480]  Kate Daly is about to take over with her special guest host, special guest visiting her.
[3:07:49.480 --> 3:07:55.480]  But I want to just encourage listeners to go to infowarstore.com right now.
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:57.480]  And get an Alan Jones's right t-shirt.
[3:07:57.480 --> 3:07:59.480]  It could be your last time, you never know.
[3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:05.480]  To get a book or a film and to get high quality supplements.
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:08.480]  Losers have really come through yet again and you are so beautiful
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:12.480]  and I actually don't feel guilty but I hate begging you for support.
[3:08:12.480 --> 3:08:14.480]  But I want to stay in this fight.
[3:08:14.480 --> 3:08:16.480]  You need these products we have.
[3:08:16.480 --> 3:08:18.480]  Our turmeric formula is the highest level of humanoid.
[3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:22.480]  That's the active ingredient in turmeric that is good for your immune system
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:32.480]  and your body and for inflammation and for your metabolic systems.
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:39.480]  As we get older, we know that our body is slow down.
[3:08:39.480 --> 3:08:43.480]  This really is life giving and it's an amazing product.
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:51.480]  It does so much for the very essence of what we are.
[3:08:51.480 --> 3:09:00.480]  We talk about as you get older, your metabolic rate lowers.
[3:09:00.480 --> 3:09:04.480]  But with things like turmeric, the highest level of humanoid, it boosts it.
[3:09:04.480 --> 3:09:16.480]  M4warstore.com, 25% off to massively boost your body's metabolic rate and your metabolism.
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:24.480]  We also have back in stock many other great products that will all be available
[3:09:24.480 --> 3:09:26.480]  for a limited time over a shutdown.
[3:09:26.480 --> 3:09:29.480]  But we are in the middle of the biggest fight of our lives right now.
[3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:32.480]  Diet force. I'm still a fat ass.
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:34.480]  I look like a gorilla actually.
[3:09:34.480 --> 3:09:36.480]  My clothes aren't that fat actually.
[3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:39.480]  But the point is I've lost 40 pounds or 39 pounds.
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:41.480]  I weighed last week. I've lost more since then.
[3:09:41.480 --> 3:09:43.480]  My wife says you look skinnier.
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:45.480]  Maybe I've lost 42 pounds. I haven't weighed over a week.
[3:09:45.480 --> 3:09:49.480]  I've lost 39 pounds with diet force that came into sample three months ago.
[3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:53.480]  It's a bunch of known concentrated compounds that are known to speed up your metabolism
[3:09:53.480 --> 3:09:55.480]  and do so much more.
[3:09:55.480 --> 3:10:02.480]  So diet force, 40% off M4warstore.com or AAA 2533139.
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:05.480]  And again, independent filmmakers made Alex's War.
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:07.480]  It's number two on the Apple Store.
[3:10:07.480 --> 3:10:09.480]  It's number one on a bunch of other platforms.
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:11.480]  Great, I'm glad they're making money. We're not making money.
[3:10:11.480 --> 3:10:16.480]  But we did buy 20,000 DVDs from them that just came in.
[3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:18.480]  They were allowed to start shipping on the 29th.
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:22.480]  So if you want to get a DVD, so it's on your shelf, so you own it digitally.
[3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:25.480]  It's on the cloud, so they can't sense her at Alan's War.
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:31.480]  You can get up to 50% off with 2000 mules and other films I've made in combos at M4warstore.com.
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:36.480]  All right, great job, the crew. Great job to everybody else that's made this broadcast possible.
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:40.480]  Kate Daly takes over with her special guest right now.
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:42.480]  Thank you, Alex. So good to be here.
[3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:45.480]  And on the Alex Jones show, of course, I'm so glad you're joining me.
[3:10:45.480 --> 3:10:47.480]  This is an important episode.
[3:10:47.480 --> 3:10:49.480]  We have Dr. Gold with us.
[3:10:49.480 --> 3:10:54.480]  She is the founder of America's Frontline Doctors, Simone Gold, M.D.J.D.,
[3:10:54.480 --> 3:10:57.480]  internationally known as the Doctor Who Went Viral.
[3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:03.480]  Dr. Gold is formerly 20 years plus board certified emergency physician and author of the bestselling book
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:07.480]  I Do Not Consent My Fight Against Medical Cancel Culture.
[3:11:07.480 --> 3:11:12.480]  Dr. Gold's mission is to make America's Frontline Doctors' leading voice of common sense.
[3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:13.480]  Boy, has she done that.
[3:11:13.480 --> 3:11:17.480]  And scientific clarity in the fight to defend our civil liberties.
[3:11:17.480 --> 3:11:25.480]  Dr. Gold graduated from the Chicago Medical School before earning her Juris Doctor from Stanford University Law School.
[3:11:25.480 --> 3:11:32.480]  She's worked in Washington, D.C. for the Surgeon General, as well as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
[3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:36.480]  This is all very important because of the story we're about to tell.
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:42.480]  And in July 2020, Dr. Gold organized the America's Frontline Doctors' White Coat Summit in Washington, D.C.
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:47.480]  I know you all remember this, which rapidly drew 20 million views online.
[3:11:47.480 --> 3:11:55.480]  Currently, aflds.org receives over 7 million, million page views per month.
[3:11:55.480 --> 3:11:59.480]  And her personal following on Twitter is over 400,000 people.
[3:11:59.480 --> 3:12:02.480]  She is a voice to be reckoned with.
[3:12:02.480 --> 3:12:05.480]  And she is a frequent guest on media outlets across the country.
[3:12:05.480 --> 3:12:10.480]  She's appeared in USA Today, Associated Press, The Guardian, New York Times, many publications.
[3:12:10.480 --> 3:12:15.480]  She has been featured on nationally syndicated programs such as Tucker and Ingram,
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:20.480]  and The Glenn Beck Show and Charlie Kirk Show, Dennis Prager, you name it.
[3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:25.480]  America's Frontline Doctors and Dr. Gold are based out of Naples, Florida.
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:28.480]  Welcome to the program, Dr. Gold. How are you today?
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:31.480]  Good afternoon. Happy to be here.
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:33.480]  I'm so glad to see you.
[3:12:33.480 --> 3:12:43.480]  And let me tell you, I am shocked by this story. I honestly have no words to describe when I found out
[3:12:43.480 --> 3:12:47.480]  about the sentence about what happened.
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:53.480]  The January 6th event is clearly in the news every single day, calling it a capital riot.
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:56.480]  I disagree with that. I don't think there was a riot.
[3:12:56.480 --> 3:13:04.480]  But I would love to hear from you the story behind what happened and what you are facing now
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:07.480]  and how you're being made an example of to me. That's how I see it.
[3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:13.480]  And so I would love to find out what happened on January 6th, Dr. Gold.
[3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:17.480]  For one thing, the conservative media is not reporting as it really was.
[3:13:17.480 --> 3:13:21.480]  You are absolutely right that overwhelmingly this was not a riot. Overwhelmingly.
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:26.480]  I myself went silent until sentencing just because that's what the lawyers advised,
[3:13:26.480 --> 3:13:29.480]  and I didn't see the point in poking the judge until he sentenced me.
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:37.480]  In retrospect, I probably should have gone out public because he was so viciously aggressively against who I am as a human being
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:39.480]  that I don't think there would have been any harm in speaking out.
[3:13:39.480 --> 3:13:43.480]  But we need conservative media to have reported accurately on that day.
[3:13:43.480 --> 3:13:47.480]  First of all, there were two sides. There's the east side and the west side.
[3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:53.480]  The west side is the side that had scaffolding, and that was a side where you saw some pictures of some people kind of climbing the scaffolding.
[3:13:53.480 --> 3:13:56.480]  And there were certainly little pockets that looked a little bit more violent.
[3:13:56.480 --> 3:14:06.480]  I would submit to you that I personally saw evidence of a little bit of violence after people were, you know,
[3:14:06.480 --> 3:14:12.480]  tear bombs were thrown. In other words, the people were not necessarily violent until they were stimulated by the police.
[3:14:12.480 --> 3:14:15.480]  Having said that, I personally wasn't even on the west side.
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:19.480]  I was on the east side. The east side was not violent at all.
[3:14:19.480 --> 3:14:21.480]  There was no scaffolding. It was just peaceful.
[3:14:21.480 --> 3:14:28.480]  There were tens of thousands of people on the east side, but most people were on the west side because you passed that side first
[3:14:28.480 --> 3:14:30.480]  if you had been coming from the ellipse.
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  The reason I was on the east side, people don't realize this, is I was actually an invited guest speaker that day.
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:41.480]  There was 20 or 25 people that were invited guest speakers at various locations,
[3:14:41.480 --> 3:14:48.480]  and I made my way along with about 25 other people, kind of in a congo line, to that location.
[3:14:48.480 --> 3:14:55.480]  And when we got to that permitted spot, which was, you know, kind of a platform and a stage and microphone set up,
[3:14:55.480 --> 3:15:00.480]  all of a sudden we were not allowed in, and I see that video that you're showing right now.
[3:15:00.480 --> 3:15:07.480]  When I was inside the Capitol, which I'll explain how I got there, but there I was giving my speech.
[3:15:07.480 --> 3:15:16.480]  The reason I was forced to give the speech inside the Capitol is the permitted area was summarily not accessible to us at the last moment.
[3:15:16.480 --> 3:15:23.480]  So what I do, all through the lockdowns, is I speak on health policy and health freedom, constitutional freedom around people's health and their own bodies.
[3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:29.480]  So I decided to do that. I had my speech in hand and I was at the top of the Capitol steps and I started giving my speech.
[3:15:29.480 --> 3:15:32.480]  And at some point the door's open from the inside.
[3:15:32.480 --> 3:15:37.480]  We're going to stop right there, and what we're going to do is we're going to come back right after the break,
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:40.480]  because I want to hear this entire story, Dr. Gold is with me.
[3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:43.480]  What an amazing hour to hear this story.
[3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:45.480]  She has been sentenced to federal prison.
[3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:49.480]  As an example, we'll be right back.
[3:15:49.480 --> 3:16:03.480]  Kate Dolly on The Alex Jones Show with Dr. Gold.
[3:16:38.480 --> 3:16:41.480]  The only way you fail is not visiting preparedtoday.com.

[3:18:02.480 --> 3:18:06.480]  All of the production and money magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year.
[3:18:06.480 --> 3:18:11.480]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[3:18:11.480 --> 3:18:17.480]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:22.480]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:27.480]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[3:18:27.480 --> 3:18:32.480]  to be able to do things tax wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[3:18:32.480 --> 3:18:37.480]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[3:18:37.480 --> 3:18:52.480]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.

[3:19:56.480 --> 3:20:02.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:16.480]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com, The Kate Daly Show.
[3:20:16.480 --> 3:20:23.480]  My very important guest in this hour is Dr. Gold, and I am so glad that she decided to spend some time with me in this hour
[3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:27.480]  because I want to learn straight from her what happened on January 6th.
[3:20:27.480 --> 3:20:31.480]  She has been sentenced to due time in federal prison.
[3:20:31.480 --> 3:20:36.480]  It's beyond what I can even fathom, and I'm sure it is for her too.
[3:20:36.480 --> 3:20:42.480]  Let's go right back. You were an invited guest. You were on the east side,
[3:20:42.480 --> 3:20:46.480]  and then you started to approach where you were going to speak.
[3:20:46.480 --> 3:20:51.480]  The place we were due to speak, somebody in a position of authority canceled it,
[3:20:51.480 --> 3:20:56.480]  and I was left standing there knowing there was tens of thousands of people that were walking over from the ellipse,
[3:20:56.480 --> 3:20:58.480]  and there was already tens of thousands of people.
[3:20:58.480 --> 3:21:01.480]  So I decided to speak, really, is what I did.
[3:21:01.480 --> 3:21:04.480]  So I was standing on the top of the Capitol steps speaking.
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:08.480]  Now, I had no A.D. equipment, so really almost nobody could hear me.
[3:21:08.480 --> 3:21:13.480]  So I stopped after about a minute or two, but that's why I was on the top of the Capitol steps,
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:18.480]  and at some point somebody opened them from the inside, and I walked in along with other people.
[3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:22.480]  I want to emphasize that had I chosen not to walk in, I would have been trampled.
[3:21:22.480 --> 3:21:27.480]  Having said that, I wasn't thinking of it one way or another, but when you come to it from a legal perspective,
[3:21:27.480 --> 3:21:32.480]  there was nowhere to go but inside when there's tens of thousands of people pushing behind you.
[3:21:32.480 --> 3:21:34.480]  That's how I found myself in the Capitol.
[3:21:34.480 --> 3:21:39.480]  Once inside the Capitol, I continued to do what I've been doing for two years now,
[3:21:39.480 --> 3:21:46.480]  which is I speak publicly on health freedom, on the fact that our Constitution gives us an inalienable right over our body,
[3:21:46.480 --> 3:21:50.480]  and that's what I speak about, and there's plenty of videos showing me walking between the ropes,
[3:21:50.480 --> 3:21:55.480]  being very peaceful, and giving my health policies speech, and that's what I did.
[3:21:55.480 --> 3:22:01.480]  I have to tell you there's been so much miscategorization of that day that it's hard to believe,
[3:22:01.480 --> 3:22:04.480]  but where I was was entirely peaceful.
[3:22:04.480 --> 3:22:09.480]  I had no idea at the time that this was going to become distorted beyond all recognition.
[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:15.480]  For the first time when I was asked to leave, finally a police officer came up to me
[3:22:15.480 --> 3:22:20.480]  when I was actually speaking, giving my speech, and he kind of put his hands on me to encourage me to leave,
[3:22:20.480 --> 3:22:23.480]  and I looked at him, and then I walked out, and that's exactly what happened.
[3:22:23.480 --> 3:22:27.480]  So I had no idea this was going to become magnified the way it was.
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:29.480]  It's beyond all recognition.
[3:22:29.480 --> 3:22:34.480]  We walked out, we hung around a little bit, and then we walked on, and that was it,
[3:22:34.480 --> 3:22:39.480]  and then we saw what the media made of that, and that was it.
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:45.480]  The avalanche, the avalanche of words to describe this event that are not accurate,
[3:22:45.480 --> 3:22:50.480]  the avalanche of blowing this out of so many proportions it doesn't have a proportion left.
[3:22:50.480 --> 3:22:55.480]  It's been amazing to me how they have talked about this in the press.
[3:22:55.480 --> 3:22:59.480]  It's always a riot, it's always an insurrection, it's all these words.
[3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:03.480]  You didn't see that, you didn't witness that, and I did witness tape
[3:23:03.480 --> 3:23:08.480]  where the officer was waving people in, and that door could have only been opened from the inside.
[3:23:08.480 --> 3:23:13.480]  So the people walked in thinking they were invited as the cops stood there on the side
[3:23:13.480 --> 3:23:17.480]  smiling as people were walking through within the roped area.
[3:23:17.480 --> 3:23:19.480]  That's what I saw.
[3:23:19.480 --> 3:23:23.480]  We have to be the living witnesses.
[3:23:23.480 --> 3:23:27.480]  There was a dearth of camera equipment, there was a dearth of media equipment.
[3:23:27.480 --> 3:23:29.480]  In retrospect, that was odd.
[3:23:29.480 --> 3:23:32.480]  I didn't pick up on it at the time, but there was virtually no media there.
[3:23:32.480 --> 3:23:35.480]  I think that was a setup, because had there been a lot of media cameras,
[3:23:35.480 --> 3:23:38.480]  people would have seen with their own eyes that there were thousands and thousands,
[3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:42.480]  hundreds of thousands, maybe a million, million and a half people in the city total.
[3:23:42.480 --> 3:23:46.480]  Certainly on my side of the Capitol, which was the smaller side, the east side,
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:51.480]  I think there was 80,000 people easily, but there was no cameras really recording all of this.
[3:23:51.480 --> 3:23:53.480]  We have to stand as witnesses.
[3:23:53.480 --> 3:23:56.480]  There were moms with baby carriages, there were grandparents,
[3:23:56.480 --> 3:23:59.480]  there were people singing kumbaya, literally kumbaya.
[3:23:59.480 --> 3:24:02.480]  There were people praying, there were people happy, joyful.
[3:24:02.480 --> 3:24:03.480]  That's what we saw.
[3:24:03.480 --> 3:24:06.480]  That was the vast, vast, vast majority of people.
[3:24:06.480 --> 3:24:14.480]  And then the real crime, though, is that the media was absent in categorizing this accurately.
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.480]  And then the government went after these people in a way that we've never seen in our nation.
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:25.480]  Political protests are ubiquitous in a country that allows free speech.
[3:24:25.480 --> 3:24:28.480]  May I bring people back to January of 2017?
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:31.480]  When President Trump was inaugurated, there were protests.
[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:34.480]  I don't know if you recall, but they were kind of violent.
[3:24:34.480 --> 3:24:39.480]  There were fires, there were people who threw kind of homemade little bomb kind of cocktails at people.
[3:24:39.480 --> 3:24:42.480]  My recollection is 209 people were arrested.
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:46.480]  208 of those charges were dropped.
[3:24:46.480 --> 3:24:52.480]  One person served time and that was for legitimately assaulting a police officer.
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:55.480]  208, I think, was the number that was dropped.
[3:24:55.480 --> 3:24:57.480]  We just saw the night of rage.
[3:24:57.480 --> 3:24:59.480]  We see people outside Brett Kavanaugh's home.
[3:24:59.480 --> 3:25:01.480]  We just saw Ilana Maher get arrested.
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:04.480]  We saw Stephen Colbert's people in the Capitol.
[3:25:04.480 --> 3:25:06.480]  Those charges were just dropped.
[3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:14.480]  The problem is the selective prosecution of a political class of persons that don't agree with the narrative.
[3:25:14.480 --> 3:25:16.480]  This is the definition of tyranny.
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:22.480]  If you are a member of Kim Jong-un, oh my goodness, I forget the name.
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:24.480]  The name of the North Korean dictator.
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:27.480]  If you're a member of his family, you're not going to be charged with a crime.
[3:25:27.480 --> 3:25:29.480]  That's what we're seeing here in America.
[3:25:29.480 --> 3:25:34.480]  If you're a member of these judges' family, if you're a member of the Clinton family, if you're a member of the Biden family,
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:40.480]  you're not going to be let off in handcuffs and shackles the way Peter Navarro is let off, the way they threaten Steve Bannon.
[3:25:40.480 --> 3:25:42.480]  So I'm here to wake people up.
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:44.480]  I'm a doctor. I'm a lawyer.
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:48.480]  If they can do this to me for free speech, they can do it to you next.
[3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:50.480]  Amen. Amen.
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:59.480]  And you know what? I wanted to go through your entire biography because I wanted people to understand what a presence you've been in the health community.
[3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:05.480]  The doctor that you are because you are such a threat to them when you were speaking out about health freedom.
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:07.480]  They wanted to silence you.
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:11.480]  This is all about picking your politics and then deciding who they're going to charge criminally.
[3:26:11.480 --> 3:26:14.480]  This is absolutely outrageous.
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:17.480]  This is appalling. This is horrific.
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:20.480]  And we as an American public should not take this.
[3:26:20.480 --> 3:26:22.480]  People were waved into the Capitol.
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:27.480]  Like you said, most people that walked in didn't even know that there was something wrong with that.
[3:26:27.480 --> 3:26:29.480]  It is the people. We did pay for that.
[3:26:29.480 --> 3:26:32.480]  I'm pretty sure. I don't know even how they got trespassing charges.
[3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:34.480]  But they keep saying armed insurrection.
[3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:37.480]  That's absolutely incorrect. Nobody was armed.
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:45.480]  And this is why nobody had a gun charge. There were not gun charges handed out to everybody is because they couldn't anyway with concealed carry.
[3:26:45.480 --> 3:26:47.480]  But also the fact that they weren't armed.
[3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:50.480]  So they have painted a story. They've painted it.
[3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:53.480]  Have you just been appalled?
[3:26:53.480 --> 3:26:55.480]  Here's an easy fact that people can know.
[3:26:55.480 --> 3:27:04.480]  So when I decide to take a plea, which is a tragedy in itself, but they squeeze you so hard that you really are in a position that you can't.
[3:27:04.480 --> 3:27:05.480]  And I'll talk about that in a minute.
[3:27:05.480 --> 3:27:08.480]  But here's a neat little fact that people can reflect upon.
[3:27:08.480 --> 3:27:16.480]  If this was such a dangerous insurrection, then how come my plea agreement says that the amount of damage that was done to the Capitol was 1.5 million?
[3:27:16.480 --> 3:27:21.480]  We're talking about an insurrection that's so violent you could barely buy a cup of coffee in Washington, D.C.
[3:27:21.480 --> 3:27:25.480]  We had an hour of writing in the summer of 2020.
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:28.480]  You had expenses that exceeded a million and a half dollars.
[3:27:28.480 --> 3:27:33.480]  They're talking about an entire day of insurrection and the entire bill to the Capitol was 1.5 million.
[3:27:33.480 --> 3:27:37.480]  I know because I signed that piece of paper that that's what it was.
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:40.480]  So good luck claiming this as an insurrection.
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:46.480]  I'm sure people are interested why I took a plea and why people are taking pleas if what I'm telling you is the truth.
[3:27:46.480 --> 3:27:51.480]  Well, there's video evidence of everything that I'm saying, so you don't have to just rely on my word.
[3:27:51.480 --> 3:27:55.480]  But the government, you know I'm a lawyer. You said that. Thank you.
[3:27:55.480 --> 3:28:02.480]  So the government's role in our criminal justice system, the government and the defense have very different roles.
[3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:06.480]  The defense exists just to really defend the defendant, whether the defendant is guilty or innocent,
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:08.480]  his job or her job is to defend the defendant.
[3:28:08.480 --> 3:28:10.480]  The government, though, has two jobs.
[3:28:10.480 --> 3:28:14.480]  The government is to prosecute the case, but the government is also what's called an officer of the court.
[3:28:14.480 --> 3:28:18.480]  Officers of the court have to walk kind of a narrow ethical line.
[3:28:18.480 --> 3:28:23.480]  One example is they're not allowed to bring charges that they don't have the elements to prove it.
[3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:29.480]  But what the government has done in this instance is they've overcharged gender six defendants so aggressively
[3:28:29.480 --> 3:28:34.480]  you can't even recognize the situation from the paperwork that they file.
[3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:40.480]  For example, in my case, and people need to hear this, I was charged with five crimes.
[3:28:40.480 --> 3:28:46.480]  The only one of the five that you could even say there was any evidence to look at was the one I accepted a plea,
[3:28:46.480 --> 3:28:49.480]  which was trespass entering and remaining.
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:51.480]  We're going to come right back.
[3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:54.480]  I want to talk about this a little bit more on the trespassing.
[3:28:54.480 --> 3:28:55.480]  We'll be right back with Dr.
[3:28:55.480 --> 3:28:59.480]  If you're like myself and so many other people on this planet, especially as you get older,
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:01.480]  you gain weight, even if you eat a lot less.
[3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:07.480]  I've got to tell you, InfoWars is only about bringing you amazing products that really work.
[3:29:07.480 --> 3:29:10.480]  So we looked at the supplement market that we fund a lot of our operations with,
[3:29:10.480 --> 3:29:17.480]  and we said, what are the best-selling, natural, healthy, anti-fat weight loss products that are out there?
[3:29:17.480 --> 3:29:24.480]  We went and looked at the top ten, and they all had the same ingredients in common that is in this product.
[3:29:24.480 --> 3:29:34.480]  But with our new product from X7, Diet Force, we got the very best concentrates of these known natural essences
[3:29:34.480 --> 3:29:36.480]  that just do amazing things for your body.
[3:29:36.480 --> 3:29:38.480]  And so I've lost almost 40 pounds.
[3:29:38.480 --> 3:29:44.480]  I'm so a little bit overweight in the last three months, and I've been doing it using Diet Force and also exercise.
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:51.480]  Well, now Diet Force is exclusively available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, 40% off.
[3:29:51.480 --> 3:29:56.480]  At InfoWarsStore.com, Diet Force, you need to take this product, it really works.
[3:29:56.480 --> 3:30:01.480]  We brought the game-changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world
[3:30:01.480 --> 3:30:07.480]  to the civilian market two years ago, the Bio Pros, for septic tanks, for porta-potties, for RVs,
[3:30:07.480 --> 3:30:10.480]  for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on.
[3:30:10.480 --> 3:30:13.480]  It'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water.
[3:30:13.480 --> 3:30:20.480]  But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to major RV parks, pig farms, you name it,
[3:30:20.480 --> 3:30:25.480]  because this stuff will eat anything that is organic.

[3:33:10.480 --> 3:33:14.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:21.480]  My guest is Dr. Gold, and I'm so happy to have her on because this story needs to be told.
[3:33:21.480 --> 3:33:24.480]  And let me remind everybody, I know that you know this out there,
[3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:26.480]  but five people did not die that day.
[3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:30.480]  In fact, they died after in different circumstances.
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:35.480]  But the news stories, even today in the news today, headline news,
[3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:38.480]  they are still giving that story, and it's completely false.
[3:33:38.480 --> 3:33:41.480]  It did not happen. Five people did not die that day.
[3:33:41.480 --> 3:33:47.480]  Also, the fire extinguisher story that was passed around the media for years now,
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:51.480]  for a year now, absolutely did not happen, completely falsified.
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:53.480]  And the coroner said it never happened.
[3:33:53.480 --> 3:33:58.480]  The 140 officers that claimed they had injuries, too, never were shown.
[3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:06.480]  In fact, never talked about, and I'm not quite sure how 140 officers would have received those kinds of injuries of assault
[3:34:06.480 --> 3:34:08.480]  when people didn't even have weapons.
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:12.480]  This was absolutely lie after lie after lie.
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:16.480]  And I'm so glad to hear from Dr. Gold because she was there.
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:22.480]  So you were talking about the charges, and it was a trespassing charge, correct?
[3:34:22.480 --> 3:34:25.480]  Yes, I have so much to say about what you just said,
[3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:28.480]  but let me pick up on the role of the government.
[3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:32.480]  The role of the government in any kind of prosecution is not just to prosecute the case,
[3:34:32.480 --> 3:34:35.480]  but also to be an officer of the court, to be an ethical, honorable officer of the court.
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:39.480]  There are certain rules, and one of them is that you cannot overcharge for crimes for which you don't have elements,
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:41.480]  the proof of the elements of the crime.
[3:34:41.480 --> 3:34:46.480]  But what they've done to all the gender six defendants I've seen is they've overcharged.
[3:34:46.480 --> 3:34:54.480]  For example, in my case, they charged me with five counts, of which there was evidence only, possibly evidence only for one.
[3:34:54.480 --> 3:34:58.480]  The other three included disorderly, of which they had no evidence because I was never disorderly,
[3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:03.480]  and they also charged me with a felony obstruction, of which they had no evidence whatsoever.
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:09.480]  But that charge, that felony charge carries a 20-year potential prison term.
[3:35:09.480 --> 3:35:19.480]  This is why people are taking plea deals, because who can risk going to trial on a 20-year felony in a D.C. jury
[3:35:19.480 --> 3:35:29.480]  where we know that the jury pool has been contaminated by, for example, the show theater that the Congress put on recently.
[3:35:29.480 --> 3:35:31.480]  This is why people are taking pleas.
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:37.480]  I just want to share with you, you just pointed out two very terrible inaccuracies and lies that the media is reporting.
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:40.480]  One of them that five people died that day or related to that day.
[3:35:40.480 --> 3:35:44.480]  That kind of ill reporting is so dangerous.
[3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:47.480]  My judge, in my case, repeated that lie.
[3:35:47.480 --> 3:35:49.480]  He used that as evidence against me.
[3:35:49.480 --> 3:35:55.480]  And I submit to you, as a lawyer, I was offended because not only was it factually inaccurate,
[3:35:55.480 --> 3:35:58.480]  what would it have to do with me anyway if it was accurate?
[3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:00.480]  It has nothing to do with me.
[3:36:00.480 --> 3:36:05.480]  Those are reasons why my judge, in particular, did not display a judicial temperament.
[3:36:05.480 --> 3:36:10.480]  Judicial temperament means you can look at the facts on the ground and you can look at the defendant dispassionately
[3:36:10.480 --> 3:36:12.480]  and put it together and make an assessment.
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:19.480]  But when you have a judge saying from the bench that I did not show remorse for five people who died as related to the Capitol,
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:27.480]  you have a judge who showed himself to be factually inaccurate and so irretrievably biased that he lacks proper judicial temperament.
[3:36:27.480 --> 3:36:32.480]  Amen. I can't imagine sitting there.
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:36.480]  I can see the press doing it because we know what the press is all about.
[3:36:36.480 --> 3:36:42.480]  But to see a judge sit there and say that, I can't even imagine what you must have been thinking.
[3:36:42.480 --> 3:36:45.480]  He should be humiliated.
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:47.480]  And I want to share with you something.
[3:36:47.480 --> 3:36:51.480]  This will be a little bit of a bombshell just for you because I'm enjoying this interview so much.
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:54.480]  And you're going to ask me a follow-up question and I'm probably not going to answer.
[3:36:54.480 --> 3:36:56.480]  Here you go.
[3:36:56.480 --> 3:36:59.480]  This judge and I went to law school together.
[3:36:59.480 --> 3:37:01.480]  We were in the same law school class.
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:04.480]  We absolutely knew each other and it's a small law school.
[3:37:04.480 --> 3:37:08.480]  There's only 150 people in a law school class at Stanford University.
[3:37:08.480 --> 3:37:14.480]  I knew him and I think there will be more coming out on that.
[3:37:14.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  But there was so much animus from the judge that day.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:20.480]  Some of it was political.
[3:37:20.480 --> 3:37:22.480]  Some of it was personal.
[3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:24.480]  Wow.
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:27.480]  First time I saw the national air.
[3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:28.480]  There you go.
[3:37:28.480 --> 3:37:29.480]  Oh my gosh.
[3:37:29.480 --> 3:37:31.480]  I'm so glad you said that.
[3:37:31.480 --> 3:37:34.480]  Stanford University Law School class of 93.
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:37.480]  Chris Cooper and my maiden name, Simone Thysos.
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:39.480]  There you go.
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:40.480]  Wow.
[3:37:40.480 --> 3:37:44.480]  Thank you for that because it had to have been some bias.
[3:37:44.480 --> 3:37:49.480]  It had to have been some things going on here because I can't imagine spewing the lies and I can't imagine the sentence.
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:52.480]  And the sentence is two months in federal prison.
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  Let's just take a pause.
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:58.480]  Has anybody ever heard of anybody going to prison for a misdemeanor?
[3:37:58.480 --> 3:38:00.480]  No.
[3:38:00.480 --> 3:38:02.480]  And nothing was done.
[3:38:02.480 --> 3:38:08.480]  I mean, even if they said, well, I don't even know how they can get away with trespassing because people were waived in.
[3:38:08.480 --> 3:38:11.480]  The door had to be open from the inside.
[3:38:11.480 --> 3:38:13.480]  It was an invitation.
[3:38:13.480 --> 3:38:17.480]  We have video of it.
[3:38:17.480 --> 3:38:25.480]  I know that AOC said a few things about that and dropped that information.
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:28.480]  But it is kind of interesting that the media won't report on it.
[3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:31.480]  But I should not be shocked because this is what we've been getting every single day.
[3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:34.480]  140 officers, think about this for a moment.
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:41.480]  140 officers standing there taking an assault and didn't fight back because no one had marks on them.
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:49.480]  Let me give you some information on that because they tried that trick with me and they did this in court and it's all in my transcript.
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:38:55.480]  So the government shows a video of me and the general was sitting on the outside.
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:59.480]  And a few feet away, there's an officer who I remember.
[3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:01.480]  I looked at his eyes.
[3:39:01.480 --> 3:39:03.480]  He looked to me as an ER doctor that he was about to faint.
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:05.480]  Whatever it was, he stumbled.
[3:39:05.480 --> 3:39:07.480]  He either fainted or he kind of tripped.
[3:39:07.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  He kind of fell several feet in front of me.
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:11.480]  And there were many people because it was so crowded.
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:13.480]  There was maybe five or six people between us.
[3:39:13.480 --> 3:39:17.480]  As he fell to the ground, the crowd chanted and you can see it.
[3:39:17.480 --> 3:39:20.480]  Get him up, get him up, get him up, get him up like that.
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:22.480]  He was on his feet within three or four seconds.
[3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:24.480]  This is all on video.
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:35.480]  Nonetheless, the government in my case tried to submit to the judge that I was somewhere in the vicinity of an officer who had been assaulted.
[3:39:35.480 --> 3:39:39.480]  So I can tell you right now that that's what they're calling assault.
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:46.480]  A video where you can see the man was not assaulted and he was lifted to his feet by the crowd and he walked off.
[3:39:46.480 --> 3:39:48.480]  That's what the government is portraying as an assault.
[3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:51.480]  That's probably what they're talking about.
[3:39:51.480 --> 3:39:52.480]  Absolutely.
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:53.480]  And you know what?
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:40:03.480]  Had one officer actually been assaulted, you don't think they would have taken out their firearms and said they would have had reason to take out Americans
[3:40:03.480 --> 3:40:05.480]  that they thought were assaulting them?
[3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:07.480]  Of course they would have.
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:09.480]  I mean, look at any kind of event.
[3:40:09.480 --> 3:40:14.480]  If something happens with an officer, you've got 10 or 20 officers right there, right?
[3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:17.480]  To make a very big deal about that and to save an officer.
[3:40:17.480 --> 3:40:18.480]  That didn't happen.
[3:40:18.480 --> 3:40:21.480]  140 officers when they kept.
[3:40:21.480 --> 3:40:24.480]  I was standing right next to officers.
[3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:28.480]  There's a picture of me in the Washington Post with officers walking behind me looking bored.
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:34.480]  There's other video where an officer is right next to me, he's got his gun right next to me holding his gun, looking utterly unbothered.
[3:40:34.480 --> 3:40:41.480]  The mood where we were on the east side of the Capitol was just like a rock concert, kind of excited and pumped up.
[3:40:41.480 --> 3:40:43.480]  But absolutely nobody was afraid.
[3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:44.480]  Nobody was fearful.
[3:40:44.480 --> 3:40:46.480]  Certainly no officers were afraid.
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:50.480]  And it's a big lie.
[3:40:50.480 --> 3:40:51.480]  Yes.
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:55.480]  And absolutely, you know, the people were there to hear the electoral college count.
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:40:58.480]  Why would they interrupt their own meeting?
[3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:04.480]  Why would they have interrupted their own meeting, their own reason for being there unless they were invited in?
[3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:12.480]  And I know that the FBI absolutely had a presence there, as they do in most things, pretending to be patriots with the brand new MAGA hats.
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:14.480]  So it was absolutely ridiculous.
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  This was a concerted effort and a three-ring circus and a kangaroo court all the way around.
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:29.480]  It still is to this day and the hearings on it is just even more circus acts that we as an American public have to indulge.
[3:41:29.480 --> 3:41:31.480]  We know nothing happened that day.
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:38.480]  And the people that walked in on the protesters that walked in on the Kavanaugh hearing, when they did that, they didn't incur any charges.
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:40.480]  There was really nothing that happened to them.
[3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:46.480]  They walked into a proceeding that would be trespassing to be a protester in that situation during those hearings.
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:47.480]  Nothing happened.
[3:41:47.480 --> 3:41:53.480]  And like you said, Stephen Colbert's staff, not a thing because, well, politics.
[3:41:53.480 --> 3:41:57.480]  And so as you were in court, were you allowed to say some of these things?
[3:41:57.480 --> 3:42:00.480]  Were you allowed to say all of these things that we're saying now?
[3:42:00.480 --> 3:42:01.480]  Yeah.
[3:42:01.480 --> 3:42:03.480]  So I, of course, have never been a criminal defendant.
[3:42:03.480 --> 3:42:10.480]  So I thought when I was showing up, because I took a plea, when I was showing up for sentencing, I thought the judge would just give the sentence.
[3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:11.480]  That's actually not what happened.
[3:42:11.480 --> 3:42:17.480]  What happened was the government said very nasty lies about me and there really wasn't much opportunity.
[3:42:17.480 --> 3:42:21.480]  And that really took me by surprise because I don't, to me, that's a trial.
[3:42:21.480 --> 3:42:24.480]  You know, you know, they say their thing, I say my thing.
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:25.480]  That's not what it was.
[3:42:25.480 --> 3:42:26.480]  And that really took me by surprise.
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:37.480]  Once you take a plea, you know, I don't really expect to talk very much, but I also don't expect the other side to be able to put forward something that sounds negative towards me.
[3:42:37.480 --> 3:42:38.480]  To prosecute you.
[3:42:38.480 --> 3:42:44.480]  I wanted people to understand why people like me take pleas because they threw a 20 year felony at me.
[3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:53.480]  And I, the person who would have adjudicated that is a D.C. jury, which we know is 96 or 97% on one political side.
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:56.480]  We'll be right back.
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:43:08.480]  The globalists are doing everything they can to destroy heterosexual relationships, to annihilate the family, to split up marriages.
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:14.480]  And if you look at the studies, the number one cause of marriages breaking up is the fact that the men cannot satisfy their women in the bedroom.
[3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:15.480]  It's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:20.480]  And even if you're like me and hardly ever have a problem, I mean, all of us, one for another, do.
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:21.480]  That's just the truth.
[3:43:21.480 --> 3:43:23.480]  The liberals will make fun of that, but everybody knows that's true.

[3:44:01.480 --> 3:44:03.480]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:04.480]  It is.
[3:44:04.480 --> 3:44:08.480]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:10.480]  The fish oil is better than that.
[3:44:10.480 --> 3:44:12.480]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[3:44:12.480 --> 3:44:18.480]  But fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[3:44:18.480 --> 3:44:19.480]  Crill oil is the best.
[3:44:19.480 --> 3:44:21.480]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[3:44:21.480 --> 3:44:24.480]  And I'm sorry, you want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[3:44:24.480 --> 3:44:25.480]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:26.480]  It's so good.
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:27.480]  In my view.
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:29.480]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[3:44:29.480 --> 3:44:32.480]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[3:44:32.480 --> 3:44:35.480]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[3:44:35.480 --> 3:44:41.480]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:44.480]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[3:44:44.480 --> 3:44:45.480]  But you know what?
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:48.480]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:49.480]  I just can't do it.
[3:44:49.480 --> 3:44:51.480]  You put your sword down.

[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:37.480]  Folks, this is a joke.
[3:46:37.480 --> 3:46:38.480]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:40.480]  It's 75% off.
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:41.480]  By the way, it works for me.
[3:46:41.480 --> 3:46:46.480]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[3:46:46.480 --> 3:46:48.480]  Quite well, I might add.
[3:46:48.480 --> 3:46:52.480]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:54.480]  I go and see them quite often now.
[3:46:56.480 --> 3:47:03.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.480 --> 3:47:08.480]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:15.480]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from the Kate Dally Show, KateDallyRadio.com.
[3:47:15.480 --> 3:47:19.480]  My guest, Dr. Gold, smart woman.
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:24.480]  And I have been so impressed with Dr. Gold and her forthright testimony.
[3:47:24.480 --> 3:47:30.480]  I've always been impressed with her videos, speaking out, and everything she has always said.
[3:47:30.480 --> 3:47:35.480]  Since this whole nonsense of COVID came out in 2020 has been amazing.
[3:47:35.480 --> 3:47:36.480]  And she's helped so many.
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:39.480]  She even helped the frontline doctors or who helped my husband.
[3:47:39.480 --> 3:47:41.480]  And he's alive today because of them.
[3:47:41.480 --> 3:47:46.480]  So I reward all of their efforts and what they have done for the American people.
[3:47:46.480 --> 3:47:51.480]  Now, I would have taken a plea knowing I was in a kangaroo court too,
[3:47:51.480 --> 3:47:54.480]  because this is no longer about justice.
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:47:59.480]  This is about making sure this has as much minimal impact on your life.
[3:47:59.480 --> 3:48:04.480]  And I believe that any of the acts described as vandalism, like the single broken window,
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:07.480]  give me a break, were done by FBI posing as patriots.
[3:48:07.480 --> 3:48:09.480]  We all know they were there.
[3:48:09.480 --> 3:48:14.480]  It was people were actually voicing concerns that they were there and among them.
[3:48:14.480 --> 3:48:18.480]  And then we also had Antifa dressed up in MAGA clothing too.
[3:48:18.480 --> 3:48:20.480]  And all of that started to come out.
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:23.480]  But of course, the media doesn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because it's truth.
[3:48:23.480 --> 3:48:29.480]  So in those charges, you took this plea deal and I agree with you, Dr. Gold,
[3:48:29.480 --> 3:48:31.480]  that you probably felt like you were in a trial again.
[3:48:31.480 --> 3:48:32.480]  How dare they?
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:35.480]  Because it was supposed to just be that sentencing, right?
[3:48:35.480 --> 3:48:38.480]  After taking that plea, which you should have never had to have taken.
[3:48:38.480 --> 3:48:41.480]  This is an absolute kangaroo court and you did nothing wrong.
[3:48:41.480 --> 3:48:44.480]  Just as you knew the day it happened, there was nothing going on.
[3:48:44.480 --> 3:48:48.480]  So tell us a little bit about that, about taking this chart,
[3:48:48.480 --> 3:48:52.480]  taking this plea and then what happened with the charges.
[3:48:52.480 --> 3:48:54.480]  Right. First of all, there was tremendous animosity from the judge.
[3:48:54.480 --> 3:48:56.480]  As I mentioned, he was completely inaccurate and biased.
[3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:57.480]  Said five people died.
[3:48:57.480 --> 3:48:59.480]  I showed no remorse, et cetera.
[3:48:59.480 --> 3:49:03.480]  Curiously enough, he spent a lot of time talking trash about America's frontline doctors.
[3:49:03.480 --> 3:49:06.480]  He was personally offended by America's frontline doctors.
[3:49:06.480 --> 3:49:11.480]  There was a lot of letters of support written on my behalf from various Americans all across the nation.
[3:49:11.480 --> 3:49:16.480]  And he held them up in his hand as though that was something bad that people were supporting me.
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:21.480]  He spoke very viciously against the fact that America's frontline doctors fundraised
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:25.480]  and he said something along the lines that I'm profiting from my crimes.
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:28.480]  And let's make it super clear, any funds that are ever raised
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:31.480]  are going right to America's frontline doctors and not to Simone Gold.
[3:49:31.480 --> 3:49:36.480]  I draw a small salary that's lower than my physician salary because I work for a nonprofit.
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:40.480]  But all the funds ever raised for America's frontline doctors go to America's frontline doctors.
[3:49:40.480 --> 3:49:46.480]  And it so happened that I took the ethical high road and paid my own law bills, legal bills, attorney bills myself.
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:48.480]  So I found that particularly offensive.
[3:49:48.480 --> 3:49:53.480]  We really are living in very – it was a kangaroo court.
[3:49:53.480 --> 3:49:56.480]  This judge was the judge in the Sussman trial, right?
[3:49:56.480 --> 3:50:00.480]  So he sat jurors who had donated the Clinton campaign.
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:07.480]  But for me, he objected to America's frontline doctors and he was all about this isn't free speech and political.
[3:50:07.480 --> 3:50:09.480]  It was really – it was just disgraceful.
[3:50:09.480 --> 3:50:11.480]  It was honestly – it was disgraceful.
[3:50:11.480 --> 3:50:15.480]  There's a group that started called freedoctorgold.org.
[3:50:15.480 --> 3:50:23.480]  And that – anyone who chooses to donate to that, those funds are used to fight for – against political persecution, situations like this.
[3:50:23.480 --> 3:50:25.480]  I'm really afraid for our nation.
[3:50:25.480 --> 3:50:29.480]  I mean, when you look back at what's happening, you know, when I saw Peter Nivera getting arrested,
[3:50:29.480 --> 3:50:31.480]  I don't even know what they arrested him for.
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:32.480]  That's the truth.
[3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:33.480]  I'm not – I don't follow this stuff that closely.
[3:50:33.480 --> 3:50:36.480]  I don't know what they arrested or they're going to Steve Bannon for.
[3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:40.480]  But all of this is just free speech and talk, right?
[3:50:40.480 --> 3:50:47.480]  So freedoctorgold funds raised are for this, to fight the political persecution.
[3:50:47.480 --> 3:50:48.480]  I love it.
[3:50:48.480 --> 3:50:53.480]  I'm so glad that you're – that you're doing something about this and taking this vested interest.
[3:50:53.480 --> 3:50:56.480]  Because this is your life and your career and look what they're trying to do to you.
[3:50:56.480 --> 3:50:59.480]  But you will prevail because American people will – are realizing this.
[3:50:59.480 --> 3:51:01.480]  They have realized this since the get-go.
[3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:05.480]  And they know that this was a complete and total circus sham.
[3:51:05.480 --> 3:51:10.480]  And so there were people that were picked out, that were put in prison right after the event.
[3:51:10.480 --> 3:51:14.480]  What was the difference between the people they put in prison that have been there the whole time
[3:51:14.480 --> 3:51:19.480]  without even knowing what their charges were, even understanding what the case was about?
[3:51:19.480 --> 3:51:21.480]  I mean, it's absolutely asinine.
[3:51:21.480 --> 3:51:23.480]  What was – what was the difference?
[3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:25.480]  You know, I thought about that a lot.
[3:51:25.480 --> 3:51:28.480]  I don't – I know there's some reason for it, but I don't know.
[3:51:28.480 --> 3:51:32.480]  I know that they're trying so desperately to get everyone to take a plea.
[3:51:32.480 --> 3:51:36.480]  Because when you don't take a plea and you go to trial, you have access to more discovery.
[3:51:36.480 --> 3:51:38.480]  And when you – when you take a plea of less discovery.
[3:51:38.480 --> 3:51:43.480]  So I think they're particularly squeezing certain people because they want them to take a plea.
[3:51:43.480 --> 3:51:45.480]  That's what I surmise.
[3:51:45.480 --> 3:51:51.480]  For all of the rest of us as Americans, we need to be very disturbed
[3:51:51.480 --> 3:51:57.480]  that there's Americans sitting in prison for 18 – or jail for 18 months pre-trial.
[3:51:57.480 --> 3:51:59.480]  This is absolutely illegal.
[3:51:59.480 --> 3:52:03.480]  And yet it happens, and my heart breaks for these people.
[3:52:03.480 --> 3:52:09.480]  Yes, that was the – well, we had the Patriot Act and the NDAA and all of these things that went through.
[3:52:09.480 --> 3:52:14.480]  And of course, when doing my interviews with certain senators who I won't name said,
[3:52:14.480 --> 3:52:16.480]  I said, oh, yes, we'll never use that.
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:17.480]  It's only on paper.
[3:52:17.480 --> 3:52:20.480]  And it's absolutely ridiculous that an American would believe that
[3:52:20.480 --> 3:52:24.480]  because they had this all set up so that they could put people in jail with –
[3:52:24.480 --> 3:52:28.480]  and remember, three Congress members tried to go see them and weren't even allowed in.
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:30.480]  How does that even happen?
[3:52:30.480 --> 3:52:32.480]  Who owns our country?
[3:52:32.480 --> 3:52:34.480]  Yeah, Louis Gohmert, Marjorie Taylor-Green.
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:36.480]  I forget who the third was, but yes.
[3:52:36.480 --> 3:52:37.480]  Right.
[3:52:37.480 --> 3:52:38.480]  Right.
[3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:39.480]  I'm just –
[3:52:39.480 --> 3:52:40.480]  I don't know why.
[3:52:40.480 --> 3:52:42.480]  I will tell you that they took me down in a very violent arrest.
[3:52:42.480 --> 3:52:43.480]  I don't know if you know that.
[3:52:43.480 --> 3:52:48.480]  Superviolent, SWAT team, 20 officers, 12 big weapons pointed me, broke down my door.
[3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:51.480]  And you don't do that for someone like me, right?
[3:52:51.480 --> 3:52:54.480]  So the only reason was to scare me into silence.
[3:52:54.480 --> 3:52:55.480]  It won't happen.
[3:52:55.480 --> 3:52:57.480]  Don't worry, America.
[3:52:57.480 --> 3:52:59.480]  I had no idea that happened to you.
[3:52:59.480 --> 3:53:01.480]  I can't even imagine.
[3:53:01.480 --> 3:53:05.480]  And if I were FBI agents in that situation, I would just be so embarrassed for myself
[3:53:05.480 --> 3:53:09.480]  at this point to call myself an American when doing that to another citizen
[3:53:09.480 --> 3:53:11.480]  and knowing what you're doing to that other citizen.
[3:53:11.480 --> 3:53:12.480]  Wouldn't you?
[3:53:12.480 --> 3:53:16.480]  I just – I'm perplexed that people will do things for their job that they know
[3:53:16.480 --> 3:53:20.480]  are so unconstitutional and over-the-top ridiculous.
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:23.480]  By the way, that's the answer, and that's the line that we have to keep teaching people.
[3:53:23.480 --> 3:53:26.480]  It's the ordinary people that need to start standing up.
[3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:31.480]  I'll tell you for sure that at least two of the FBI agents there that day were so uncomfortable
[3:53:31.480 --> 3:53:32.480]  with how that day was playing out.
[3:53:32.480 --> 3:53:33.480]  I could see it on their face.
[3:53:33.480 --> 3:53:36.480]  They were a little bit – actually, they were younger, and they could just see it.
[3:53:36.480 --> 3:53:40.480]  So if you're a nurse, a doctor, a teacher, you are a police officer,
[3:53:40.480 --> 3:53:41.480]  you're a hairdresser, you're a gym owner.
[3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:45.480]  You cannot comply with things that you know and your soul are wrong,
[3:53:45.480 --> 3:53:48.480]  and especially if you're a police officer.
[3:53:48.480 --> 3:53:49.480]  Yes.
[3:53:49.480 --> 3:53:51.480]  Why didn't that judge recuse himself?
[3:53:51.480 --> 3:53:53.480]  If he knew, I can't even imagine.
[3:53:53.480 --> 3:53:55.480]  I mean, can we say mistrial?
[3:53:55.480 --> 3:54:02.480]  I mean, I can't even imagine the fact that that needs to be talked about, Dr. Gold.
[3:54:02.480 --> 3:54:08.480]  There's more to the story that I just can't say at the moment, but one day I will.
[3:54:08.480 --> 3:54:09.480]  I understand.
[3:54:09.480 --> 3:54:14.480]  Thank you for that, because the more we understand about this, the more horrific it gets.
[3:54:14.480 --> 3:54:20.480]  And like we said before, 100 officers could have never been assaulted.
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:21.480]  What did they do?
[3:54:21.480 --> 3:54:24.480]  Stand there and take karate kicks and punches?
[3:54:24.480 --> 3:54:27.480]  I mean, my gosh, it would have never happened.
[3:54:27.480 --> 3:54:32.480]  The way these people were assaulted is the same way you were assaulted at a rock concert.
[3:54:32.480 --> 3:54:34.480]  You're jostling, you're next to each other.
[3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:36.480]  They're literally calling that an assault.
[3:54:36.480 --> 3:54:43.480]  You're standing next to someone and you're being pushed a little like a subway, like a rock concert.
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:48.480]  Yes, and I wish more Americans, the Americans that go, wow, 140 should be saying,
[3:54:48.480 --> 3:54:50.480]  how would 140 give me a break?
[3:54:50.480 --> 3:54:55.480]  This could never happen ever with the police state that we're in right now, ever.
[3:54:55.480 --> 3:54:59.480]  Listen, it would have been a whole lot better if there had been 140 officers.
[3:54:59.480 --> 3:55:02.480]  You know, the side I was on there was like, there was like two.
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:03.480]  Yes.
[3:55:03.480 --> 3:55:06.480]  But yeah, please, please show us anyone in the crowd with a mark on them,
[3:55:06.480 --> 3:55:08.480]  because I doubt they stood there and took it.
[3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:10.480]  My gosh, I mean, give me a break, right?
[3:55:10.480 --> 3:55:12.480]  It's the whole story in sham.
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:17.480]  I would be so embarrassed to be a member of our government in DC right now.
[3:55:17.480 --> 3:55:22.480]  And on that little board of liars trying to tell these stories,
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:26.480]  because they absolutely have to conjure them up in order to say them.
[3:55:26.480 --> 3:55:29.480]  But you know what's really pathetic is that the media is so bought and sold,
[3:55:29.480 --> 3:55:31.480]  they will not do their job and tell the truth.
[3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:32.480]  They refuse to.
[3:55:32.480 --> 3:55:34.480]  And they could have actually asked questions.
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:40.480]  Boy, that would have been something new and could have actually stopped with the lies.
[3:55:40.480 --> 3:55:42.480]  But no, and this is what we get handed.
[3:55:42.480 --> 3:55:45.480]  And so people believe the media.
[3:55:45.480 --> 3:55:49.480]  I want to enter time on something really positive.
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:52.480]  There's an opportunity here to build something so much better.
[3:55:52.480 --> 3:55:54.480]  We can see the lies so clearly.
[3:55:54.480 --> 3:55:56.480]  There's a lot of people on our side who need a new media.
[3:55:56.480 --> 3:55:58.480]  You need a new educational system.
[3:55:58.480 --> 3:55:59.480]  And my lane is healthcare.
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:02.480]  So we've built something new, and it's called gold care.
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:05.480]  And one of our taglines is it's not healthcare, it's gold care.
[3:56:05.480 --> 3:56:08.480]  So if you're hearing you want something better and different for your health,
[3:56:08.480 --> 3:56:11.480]  which is really my lane, you can go check out goldcare.com.
[3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:14.480]  Because I really want to be optimistic that there's an opportunity.
[3:56:14.480 --> 3:56:18.480]  Every time there's something destructive, something better can arise.
[3:56:18.480 --> 3:56:20.480]  And we're going to do that with goldcare.com.
[3:56:20.480 --> 3:56:22.480]  I hope you check it out.
[3:56:22.480 --> 3:56:24.480]  I love this.
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:27.480]  Dr. Gold, you are a true American smart cookie.
[3:56:27.480 --> 3:56:31.480]  And I really appreciate you coming on because I'll tell you why.
[3:56:31.480 --> 3:56:40.480]  You have done more good for this nation in talking about what was going on with COVID and the shots and everything else that has been so harmful to our nation.
[3:56:40.480 --> 3:56:42.480]  And I appreciate your honesty.
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:44.480]  I appreciate you coming out.
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:48.480]  You and all of the other doctors involved that said, you know what?
[3:56:48.480 --> 3:56:50.480]  I am not going to put my career first.
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:51.480]  I'm going to put the people first.
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:57.480]  And I'm going to make sure they're actually cared for because those were the only doctors I turned to when my husband was in the hospital.
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:56:59.480]  And that's the only reason he's alive today.
[3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:00.480]  And I really appreciate you.
[3:57:00.480 --> 3:57:03.480]  Thank you for all that you're doing.
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:05.480]  I'm so happy to hear that.
[3:57:05.480 --> 3:57:06.480]  God bless.
[3:57:06.480 --> 3:57:07.480]  I mean, it's true.
[3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:08.480]  It's true.
[3:57:08.480 --> 3:57:09.480]  It's amazing.
[3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:12.480]  That's who I turned to and got advice from, and that's why he's alive.
[3:57:12.480 --> 3:57:20.480]  And it's all your efforts as American frontline doctors that are helping people throughout this nation understand the truth about what we've been told for the last two and a half years.
[3:57:20.480 --> 3:57:22.480]  And that kind of honesty and integrity.
[3:57:22.480 --> 3:57:25.480]  When I think of Americans, I think of you.
[3:57:25.480 --> 3:57:30.480]  I think of the many people that put this nation first as far as truth and integrity.
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:32.480]  Thank you so much, Dr. Gold, for joining me.
[3:57:32.480 --> 3:57:34.480]  I really appreciate you, really.
[3:57:34.480 --> 3:57:38.480]  And I'm so sorry for what you're having to incur.
[3:57:38.480 --> 3:57:39.480]  Thank you.
