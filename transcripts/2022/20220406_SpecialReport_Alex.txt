[00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.854]  Uh, so I am rolling.
[00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:02.335]  I'll be ready.
[00:00:02.616 --> 00:00:05.042]  Well, can you tell us at all what you're talking about in there?
[00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:07.830]  We can't get into what's happening in the Deaf...
[00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:16.518]  We can't get into what's happening inside there because right now they've marked the deposition as confidential and so have we, but I can tell you why I'm here.
[00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:28.545]  I'm here because there is a war against the First Amendment and the Democratic Party and others are trying to use the Sandy Hook tragedy as a pretext to not just erase my First Amendment, but all Americans' First Amendment.
[00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:29.906]  This is all about cancel culture.
[00:00:30.186 --> 00:00:31.306]  This is all about censorship.
[00:00:31.727 --> 00:00:35.429]  It's about the dying corporate media wanting to demonize the independent media.
[00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:36.590]  I've certainly made mistakes.
[00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.310]  I'm not perfect.
[00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.291]  I apologize for those.
[00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:43.633]  But the mainstream media lied about WMDs in Iraq, lied about so many things.
[00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.633]  Jussie Smollett got caught lying.
[00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:52.356]  We have thousands of cases of governments, organizations, corporations, individuals staging events.
[00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:57.698]  And so Americans ask questions about all events, and we have a right to do that under the First Amendment.
[00:00:58.078 --> 00:01:00.740]  The power structure doesn't want people to be able to ask questions.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.421]  I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:03.602]  I'm sorry for the families.
[00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:11.907]  But they're being used, in my view, as pawns by powerful Democrat law firms that want to try to shut down InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.749]  And once that domino falls, they'll be able to shut down everybody.
[00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:20.554]  People don't even remember Adam Lenz's name, the crazed teenager that went and killed those poor children and others.
[00:01:20.874 --> 00:01:24.277]  They think about Alex Jones when they hear about the dead children.
[00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:24.817]  How is that?
[00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:26.619]  That's media brainwashing.
[00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.905]  That's a system that wants to shut down its competition, taking a few things somebody said out of context, and then setting them up as a villain.
[00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:41.191]  I'm not a villain, and I'm here to stand up for the First Amendment of all Americans to question anything they wish.
[00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:43.153]  That is what this country is all about.
[00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:48.554]  So Alex, just so I'm clear, you are walking back what you first said about Sandy Hook being a hoax?
[00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.894]  I walked back when I said about Shanning Hood years and years and years ago.
[00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:57.638]  The corporate media has never really let my quotes about that or my apologies get out.
[00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:02.442]  They keep misrepresenting that I'm currently denying it happened or I'm attacking the families.
[00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:03.743]  None of that happened.
[00:02:03.863 --> 00:02:07.587]  I did question some of the anomalies, but I learned those anomalies were not correct.
[00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:08.888]  I corrected myself.
[00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:12.591]  Even at the time of Megyn Kelly years ago, I said I believe it happened.
[00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:14.733]  They edited that out of the interview.
[00:02:14.993 --> 00:02:16.034]  I hope you don't do that here.
[00:02:18.322 --> 00:02:18.702]  Thank you.
[00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:20.063]  Thank you so much for talking to me.
[00:02:20.163 --> 00:02:20.523]  God bless.
[00:02:20.563 --> 00:02:21.064]  Thank you.
[00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:22.565]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:33.507]  You know, I'm not going to get into the details of the deposition because I know the judge earlier on has said don't release part of the deposition.
[00:02:34.047 --> 00:02:36.689]  Now, I know that Koskoff is saying now they want to release his depositions.
[00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.351]  They want to keep their depositions secret but put mine out.
[00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:41.412]  That's what they've done this whole time.
[00:02:41.852 --> 00:02:42.713]  I'm being railroaded.
[00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:46.776]  I've been defaulted, they say, for not giving them documents or falsifying documents.
[00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:50.759]  But they have all the documents and are saying they're real in my deposition.
[00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.081]  So I know the judge has lied.
[00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:59.667]  I know that we gave them all the real documents and she decided to say that we're guilty of a crime and gave her fake documents.
[00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:03.110]  On my four and a half year old daughter, we did not give them fake documents.
[00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.972]  That'd be struck down by lightning.
[00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:07.194]  So they have all demonized me.
[00:03:07.254 --> 00:03:09.676]  They have decided I can be destroyed and I'm being railroaded.
[00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:11.858]  I am having my rights destroyed.
[00:03:11.898 --> 00:03:15.942]  I've had my eighth amendment destroyed with huge fines that are cruel and unusual.
[00:03:16.943 --> 00:03:19.265]  They changed their deposition times eight times with us.
[00:03:19.345 --> 00:03:22.268]  I've already been deposed three times in Sandy Hook in another case.
[00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:23.489]  I've not hidden from any of this.
[00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.650]  Boom.
[00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.992]  I get sick last week with a sinus infection and stuff.
[00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:27.692]  Had vertigo.
[00:03:28.553 --> 00:03:29.254]  Instant fines.
[00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:29.534]  $25,000 a day.
[00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:31.355]  Get up here to Kinetic.
[00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:32.496]  You can do it right now.
[00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:33.057]  You're a criminal.
[00:03:33.517 --> 00:03:34.378]  No, I'm not a criminal.
[00:03:34.698 --> 00:03:36.240]  I didn't kill the children at Sandy Hook.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.744]  Adam Lanza did, but everyone knows Alex Jones is connected to Sandy Hook now because they're using it as a way to demonize the First Amendment.
[00:03:44.104 --> 00:03:46.786]  We have seen Jussie Smollett stage his racial attack.
[00:03:47.106 --> 00:03:48.867]  We've seen WMDs in Iraq being faked.
[00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:50.728]  We've seen the Gulf of Tonkin being faked.
[00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:56.891]  We have seen so many examples of things being staged that we have a right to challenge events that have anomalies.
[00:03:57.292 --> 00:03:59.173]  Years ago I said I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:06.186]  And that's when they sued me and have come after me because I got so famous they've attached me to Sandy Hook claiming I became famous from Sandy Hook.
[00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:16.692]  No, I became famous being a talk show host for 28 years and my show exploded under Obama because when you have a Democrat in office, conservative talk radio gets bigger.
[00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:20.114]  When you have a Republican in office, Democrats get bigger.
[00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:27.272]   That's why CNN and MSNBC got so huge under Trump, and then as soon as he left, the ratings plunged.
[00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:29.052]  Now let me ask this about- I'll explain.
[00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:34.934]  They're saying I built my news operation off Sandy Hook that was less than 1% of what we covered over the years.
[00:04:35.434 --> 00:04:36.394]  Not even 1.5%, 1%.
[00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:37.654]  It's a lie.
[00:04:38.055 --> 00:04:39.395]  So that part's a lie.
[00:04:39.795 --> 00:04:43.656]  It's not about whether I question whether the children died or not or talked about anomalies.
[00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:48.077]  It's that they lie and say that I didn't give them documents and I falsified reports.
[00:04:48.757 --> 00:04:53.160]  Then that judge should go to the federal government or to an agency and call for my indictment.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.023]  If we falsified financial reports, then they should be able to indict me.
[00:04:57.603 --> 00:04:59.624]  But no, she's a liar and they're a liar.
[00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:02.326]  And our freedoms are being trampled and destroyed.
[00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:04.127]  They have all my documents, they have everything.
[00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:08.430]  No one in a defamation case, I'm told, has ever turned over this much stuff.
[00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.552]  And they say I've given them nothing or it's fake.
[00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:13.495]  And that is totally, absolutely not true.
[00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:16.318]  And so, they knew that I couldn't have a fair trial.
[00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:22.165]  So they tried me in the press, they demonized me, they said I'm a fraud, they said I'm a liar, they say I gave them fake documents.
[00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:23.666]  They did all this.
[00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:27.971]  I questioned whether Sandy Hook was fake years ago, and I'm supposedly the worst guy on earth.
[00:05:28.272 --> 00:05:30.915]  Now they, with no evidence, say I gave them false financial records.
[00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:35.826]  It's totally insane what has happened here in this country.
[00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:37.067]  So I didn't kill the children.
[00:05:37.407 --> 00:05:38.187]  Adam Lanza did.
[00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:39.527]  I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[00:05:39.907 --> 00:05:47.730]  But I'm being used to be demonized so that they can go and censor alternative media because the mainstream corporate media is dying and they want to be able to shut us down.
[00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.431]  So the family is claiming that they've been getting hate messages from some of your followers based off of what you've said.
[00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:54.132]  What is your message?
[00:05:54.152 --> 00:05:55.352]  What do you have to say about that?
[00:05:55.672 --> 00:05:59.395]  Well, somebody could start sending you guys hate messages in somebody else's name.
[00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:01.676]  Or somebody could send hate messages in your name.
[00:06:01.696 --> 00:06:02.937]  Does that mean you could take it off the air?
[00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:10.282]  That idea that they claim some people harassed them with no real evidence of that, and now I'm going to be taken off the air, which is basically their goal.
[00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:12.303]  Look, most of the families didn't sue me.
[00:06:12.563 --> 00:06:14.104]  And those that did, I understand, have had a lot of pain.
[00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:16.006]  But attacking me won't bring their children back.
[00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:22.590]  And claiming that my free speech is hurting them and then misrepresenting what I've said is not going to bring their children back.
[00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.150]  Okay.
[00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.171]  And so they're using this to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:34.952]  Everybody's right to free speech and to question things like WMDs in Iraq, or Operation Northwoods, or the Gulf of Tonkin, or Jussie Smollett.
[00:06:35.092 --> 00:06:37.153]  I said Jussie Smollett was fake the day after it happened.
[00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:37.813]  Didn't buy it.
[00:06:38.493 --> 00:06:39.213]  And I was right.
[00:06:39.533 --> 00:06:40.933]  So I'm right more than I'm wrong.
[00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:41.953]  Sometimes I'm wrong.
[00:06:42.153 --> 00:06:44.854]  And I said years ago, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:48.555]  And they've made a huge deal about questioning narratives.
[00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.475]  And that's what's happening.
[00:06:49.495 --> 00:06:51.035]  So I have to get back in this deposition.
[00:06:51.155 --> 00:06:54.136]  What do you have to say to your followers who still believe that Sandy Hook is a hoax?
[00:06:54.636 --> 00:07:00.117]  Well, when people say, your followers believe Sandy Hook's a hoax, the internet didn't believe it day one it happened.
[00:07:00.157 --> 00:07:01.637]  We covered the internet not believing it.
[00:07:02.097 --> 00:07:12.700]  So, people not trusting the mainstream media and the government is the government and the mainstream media's fault being caught lying so much no one questions, no one basically believes what they have to say anymore.
[00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.360]  Okay, so just because the corporate media is discredited doesn't mean that's Alex Jones' fault.
[00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.541]  It's the corporate media's fault.
[00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:19.141]  Good talking to you.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.980]  Thank you.
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:33.701]   I just want to thank listeners because we're in the thick of the battle now.
[00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:40.449]  We're at the most critical point and nobody else has audiences this big that will tell the truth like we're doing.
[00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.371]  You did this.
[00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:43.452]  You are the info war.
[00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:54.615]  So, I want to encourage listeners to understand, if we hadn't sold 10,000 coins in December, the first part of the three-part series of the Liberty Coin, we would not be able to be operating right now.
[00:07:54.715 --> 00:07:56.677]  We need to sell all three of the series.
[00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:58.899]  The third is being minted right now here in America.
[00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:01.722]  The second is here in our warehouse shipping out today.
[00:08:01.842 --> 00:08:03.163]  It will sell out the next week.
[00:08:03.303 --> 00:08:04.404]  It's the Liberty Tree edition.
[00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.127]  The blood of patriots and tyrants must be shed for freedom.
[00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:13.311]  It is available at InfowarsStore.com right now, or 1776coin.com.
[00:08:13.471 --> 00:08:22.898]  And if we are able to stay on air, and if we stop nuclear war and all this, in the next few months we're planning to do some very special things, very special projects for just the members that are part of this.
[00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:24.199]  That's why it's called a founding member coin.
[00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:26.040]  But regardless, you're keeping us on air.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.721]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:08:27.781 --> 00:08:30.684]  Get your founding member, Liberty Tree, Thomas Jefferson coin.
[00:08:30.844 --> 00:08:35.949]  It is an amazing coin that I did the concept on, that a great designer created, and this is powerful.
[00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:45.417]  This is history, and this is your chance to have a memento of your support of liberty and freedom that sits in your pocket, or on your mantel, or your desk, or wherever you want, and just to let you know that you kept us on air.
[00:08:45.657 --> 00:08:48.900]   As bad as things are, as crazy as things are, We can't give up right now.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.903]  We gotta just pull, continue on in the fight.
[00:08:52.023 --> 00:08:53.745]  That's what you do at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:08:53.885 --> 00:08:57.829]  Great books, great films, great t-shirts, great supplements, great shortwave radios.
[00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.611]  Air filtration, water filtration, it's all there.
[00:09:00.712 --> 00:09:02.173]  Big sale, biggest sale ever.
[00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:06.394]   75% off on some of some of the items like t-shirts that are great t-shirts
[00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:07.115]  that we never promoted.
[00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:09.514]   They're just sitting there in our warehouse and we're like, "Hey, we can't
[00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:12.835]   pay payroll. You need to sell these 50 t-shirts, Jones, you said make, you never
[00:09:12.835 --> 00:09:16.274]   push." Like, "Okay, they're... sell them below cost. Get them out of the store. I
[00:09:16.274 --> 00:09:19.835]   need your help, plus it's a great shirts." The only way we fail is if you don't take
[00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:23.754]   action. Infowarsstore.com for the t-shirts, books, and films, supplements, and
[00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:30.994]   1776coin.com for the Liberty Tree coin. We are fighting the new world order at
[00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:35.166]  I am absolutely going up against the worst people at every level.
[00:09:35.226 --> 00:09:38.067]  And it's only been your prayers and your support that's kept us on air.
[00:09:38.087 --> 00:09:40.729]  And so I'm telling you now, we have reached the thick of the battle.
[00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.950]  We have reached the heart of the war.
[00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.792]  We are entering the most important phase of the war against tyranny.
[00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:50.114]  And fighting back against their unrestricted, undeclared war against us.
[00:09:50.334 --> 00:09:51.035]  People come after me?
[00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:53.276]  I fight 50 times harder.
[00:09:53.956 --> 00:09:56.478]  So now the globalists declared war on me and my family?
[00:09:56.918 --> 00:09:58.699]  Well, we are gonna turn up the heat.
[00:09:59.309 --> 00:10:03.091]  Let's open up the cans of anti-New World Order resistance, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:09.333]  So, I need money to prosecute war of information and truth, and I need money at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:10.554]  I got the best durable food.
[00:10:10.574 --> 00:10:11.554]  I got the best supplements.
[00:10:11.574 --> 00:10:12.815]  We got amazing t-shirts.
[00:10:12.895 --> 00:10:15.536]  There are better t-shirt designers than me out there, but ours are pretty good.
[00:10:15.896 --> 00:10:17.777]  We've got incredible everything.
[00:10:17.797 --> 00:10:19.519]  Films, books, everything.
[00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.880]  It's an arsenal of freedom.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.140]  It's an arsenal of resistance.
[00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:24.742]  Infowarstore.com!
[00:10:24.902 --> 00:10:26.964]  And then we will continue to give you the truth.
[00:10:26.984 --> 00:10:28.845]  We will continue to stand against the New World Order.
[00:10:28.865 --> 00:10:30.366]  We will continue to not back down.
[00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:32.348]  Because I will never give up!
[00:10:33.371 --> 00:10:34.912]  I will never back down.
[00:10:35.813 --> 00:10:37.013]  But I could collapse.
[00:10:37.193 --> 00:10:38.214]  I could give out.
[00:10:38.594 --> 00:10:40.315]  And it's you that's going to hold us up in this fight.
[00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:43.817]  And I need money to prosecute this war against Soros and the New World Order.
[00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.558]  Our defensive war for our children.
[00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:46.799]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:10:46.899 --> 00:10:47.560]  Go there now.
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.242]  We need major funding in our counteroffensive against the New World Order.
[00:10:51.201 --> 00:10:52.620]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:59.620]   Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying,
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:06.701]  empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[00:11:06.701 --> 00:11:08.701]  [Music]
[00:11:08.385 --> 00:11:11.528]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today.
[00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:23.979]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human, depopulation, Great Reset Combine trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:31.165]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers.
[00:11:31.906 --> 00:11:39.912]  That are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[00:11:40.532 --> 00:11:42.013]  And none of it can succeed.
[00:11:42.073 --> 00:11:47.057]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[00:11:47.717 --> 00:11:51.660]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.602]  And that's why it's hard to share InfoWars links and Bandai video links.
[00:11:55.662 --> 00:11:57.564]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
