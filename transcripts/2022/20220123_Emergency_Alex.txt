[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:15.837]  A week and a half ago, the globalists were meeting at the Davos Group and they were hitting the panic button for world leaders to silence their populations questioning the COVID-19 biomedical police state power grab.
[00:00:15.837 --> 00:00:22.661]  Joe Biden went to the airwaves and ordered the media and ordered Big Tech to silence the American people.
[00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:27.103]  And now, a week and a half later, it's blown up in their face and they have failed.
[00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:46.928]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:54.131]  Both of these amazing products have been sold out for almost half a year because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:57.773]  You've done a great job supporting InfoWars and supporting your immune system.
[00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:02.175]  The problem is with all the COVID lockdowns, the Great Reset, we can't get these products in.
[00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.937]  So finally they came in, but a limited run
[00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:05.638]  I think.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.780]  It's Saturday, January 22, 2022.
[00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:57.282]  And we have got an incredible news alert for you today.
[00:01:57.282 --> 00:02:01.964]  Three huge stories.
[00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:05.184]  First off, it's now official.
[00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:14.967]  All over the world, whether you are in Europe or Canada or the United States or the UK, suddenly governments are announcing an end to the mask.
[00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:15.658]  Yes.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:52.312]  All these different government institutions, all the different medical systems, the CDC here in the United States, the National Health Service in the UK, they all came out simultaneously from Ireland to the United States and said, you know what?
[00:02:52.312 --> 00:02:55.894]  We're just ending all of the restrictions.
[00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.456]  So why are they ending this now?
[00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:01.939]  Is it because the deaths are way down in 2022 and 2021?
[00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:02.719]  No, they're actually way up.
[00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:10.350]  from the first big year of the pandemic before we had the vaccine.
[00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.373]  Is it because the bureaucrats just want to give us our freedoms back?
[00:03:15.373 --> 00:03:17.094]  No, that's not it either.
[00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:29.900]  It's because they know all over the world such firm, powerful opposition has formed at the governmental, corporate, and private individual level that there was a massive tide
[00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:33.437]  of resistance that they wouldn't be able to stop.
[00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:35.959]  A huge tide of peaceful resistance.
[00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:50.666]  The majority of Conservative Tories and of Liberal Labour Party members in the UK last week came to Boris Johnson and said, we can outvote you with a super majority.
[00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:53.507]  And he had to back down.
[00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:56.769]  And the same thing is now happening in Canada.
[00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.250]  The same thing is now happening here in the United States.
[00:04:00.464 --> 00:04:05.169]  As Democrat governors and Democrat legislatures say, you are turning everyone against us.
[00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.411]  We are the most unpopular we've ever been.
[00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:08.612]  What are you doing?
[00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:12.716]  Plus, the public's not buying into your official narrative.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:33.265]  And we have the medical services, both private and corporate, around the world leading the way exposing that these so-called vaccines aren't vaccines, they're gene therapies that actually erase your immune system and the vast majority of people dead and dying in hospitals have been vaccinated and that's why they're panicking.
[00:04:33.746 --> 00:04:38.908]  Because they can put out fake headlines of you're 20 times more likely to be hospitalized if you haven't had the shot.
[00:04:38.908 --> 00:04:39.868]  It's not true.
[00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:44.270]  They can put out fake headlines that 99% of hospitalized are unvaccinated.
[00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.911]  Remember Fauci a year ago?
[00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.632]  All of it is a giant lie.
[00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:56.735]  And they gaslit us with the corporate media and they lied to us at every level and they used the local health departments to lie.
[00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:57.395]  But the lie
[00:04:58.516 --> 00:04:59.396]  Has now failed.
[00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:01.557]  This is a very historic moment.
[00:05:01.557 --> 00:05:04.119]  We have crossed a political Rubicon here.
[00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:08.160]  Now they claim they'd get rid of the restrictions a year ago, but I said they'd bring them back.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.564]  That's because when they know the opposition builds to a point where it could defeat them, they back off, so we go back to sleep, then they bring the restrictions back again.
[00:05:16.564 --> 00:05:22.047]  And I'm predicting here, they're going to do it again, but not right away.
[00:05:22.728 --> 00:05:31.111]  Because again, all the tricks they've played have not worked and then releasing some of the pressure a year ago only backfired on them.
[00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:43.477]  So I'm predicting that you'll see blue cities and blue states in the US and some really controlled areas like New Zealand and Australia continue on with some of the restrictions.
[00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:51.760]  But in general, the globalists have enough of the public that want to have vaccine passports now and want to have social credit scores and who want to be tracked
[00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:53.617]  That's what Bill Gates has been saying.
[00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:18.232]  It's coming out of the jungles because the world's too hot.
[00:06:18.232 --> 00:06:25.835]  You're going to die of a new super virus because you eat too many hamburgers, or you have a car, or you have heating and air conditioning.
[00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:26.795]  It's voodoo.
[00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:30.477]  No, they're cooking this garbage up in labs.
[00:06:30.477 --> 00:06:38.540]  And Beto and AOC and all the Hollywood trash, like the before-mentioned DiCaprio, are telling
[00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.693]  That it's imminent that almost all of us will die by 2030.
[00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:47.835]  William Shatner gets off the space pod a few months ago.
[00:06:47.835 --> 00:06:53.738]  He says, too bad everyone will be dead on the surface soon, but it's our fault, right?
[00:06:53.738 --> 00:06:58.000]  They have let all these people in on the depopulation agenda.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.021]  Hell, they've let the public in on it.
[00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:07.704]  They've got Wall Street Journal and New York Times headlines about looking forward to the end of humanity because we're a curse.
[00:07:07.704 --> 00:07:08.685]  But the good news is,
[00:07:10.475 --> 00:07:18.519]  If you read the Rockefeller and Bill Gates documents, they plan to have the first phase of the lockdown go for four years, then pull it off for a little while, then bring it back.
[00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:27.163]  But this time after two years, they're having to back off because again, it forms so much opposition that it could actually bring down their whole system.
[00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:35.147]  So they're backing off now because again, they think that that will make opposition go away and then they can move at us with the next weapon.
[00:07:35.527 --> 00:07:41.390]  Which I believe will be a staged cyber attack and major power outages worldwide because they've been telegraphing that.
[00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.331]  That's why we've got to stay vigilant.
[00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.172]  That's why we've got to stay focused.
[00:07:45.172 --> 00:08:04.362]  That's why we've got to bring to justice all the liars during this entire process like Fauci and others that purposely lied about statistics that suppressed life-saving therapeutic treatments and then lied and pushed poisonous gene therapies on the public and all the other
[00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:29.806]  The first clip I want to play is from early January, just a few weeks ago, when Biden was hitting the panic button before the Davos group met, that's the public arm of the Bilderberg group, and decided about a week and a half ago to start killing this phase of the pandemic biomedical tyranny
[00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:34.669]  Unfortunately, while our military is stepping up, as they always do, there are others sitting on the sidelines and we're standing in the way.
[00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.510]  If you haven't gotten vaccinated, do it.
[00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:37.571]  Personal choice.
[00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:01.852]  Impacts us all.
[00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:04.674]  Our hospitals, our countries.
[00:09:04.674 --> 00:09:08.496]  I make a special appeal to social media companies and media outlets.
[00:09:08.496 --> 00:09:14.179]  Please deal with the misinformation and disinformation that's on your shows.
[00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:16.280]  It has to stop.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.703]  COVID-19 is one of the most formidable enemies America has ever faced.
[00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:23.204]  We've got to work together, not against each other.
[00:09:23.204 --> 00:09:25.105]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:25.105 --> 00:09:29.428]  Biden demands big tech censor those who question regime's COVID narrative.
[00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:41.038]  That's right when the Davos Group was meeting, and the Davos Group itself came out and said, time to end this lockdown and move on to climate lockdowns, and that's coming up.
[00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:59.124]  Now here's another short clip from the Bill Maher Show, the full clip's on Infowars.com, showing a liberal New York Times columnist coming out and calling the COVID tyranny a catastrophic moral crime, and that it was all a fraud.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:10.033]  She went on to say that they lied and said that taking the shots would get us back to normal but we ended up with more sick people, more dying people, all the statistics show.
[00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:14.379]  So humanity's survival instinct is finally kicking back in.
[00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:14.880]  Here's the clip.
[00:10:17.745 --> 00:10:18.966]  With this question?
[00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:20.929]  No, I'm done with COVID.
[00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:21.449]  I'm done.
[00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:24.313]  It's like, I went so hard on COVID.
[00:10:24.313 --> 00:10:32.142]  I sprayed the Pringles cans that I bought at the grocery store, stripped my clothes off because I thought COVID would be on my clothes.
[00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:33.283]  Like, I did it all.
[00:10:33.283 --> 00:10:34.384]  I watched Tiger King.
[00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.766]  I got to the end of Spotify.
[00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:38.668]  We all did it, right?
[00:10:38.668 --> 00:10:40.748]  No, we didn't all do it.
[00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:42.429]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:10:42.429 --> 00:10:43.749]  A lot of us did do it.
[00:10:43.749 --> 00:10:46.750]  And then we were told, you get the vaccine.
[00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.770]  You get the vaccine and you get back to normal.
[00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.331]  And we haven't gotten back to normal.
[00:10:53.331 --> 00:10:54.952]  And it's ridiculous at this point.
[00:10:56.167 --> 00:11:09.901]  I know that so many of my liberal and progressive friends are with me on this, and they do not want to say it out loud because they are scared to be called anti-vax or to be called science denial or to be, you know, smeared as a Trumper.
[00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:15.527]  I'm sorry, if you believe the science, you will look at the data that we did not have two years ago.
[00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:20.972]  And you will find out that cloth masks do not do anything.
[00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:28.320]  You will realize that you can show your vaccine passport at a restaurant and still be asymptomatic and carrying Omicron.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:35.847]  And you will realize, most importantly, that this is going to be remembered by the younger generation as a catastrophic moral crime.
[00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:44.352]  The city of Flint, Michigan, which is 80%, I think, minority students, has just announced indefinite virtual schooling.
[00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:49.978]  In the past two years, we've seen, among young girls, a 51% increase in self-harm.
[00:11:49.978 --> 00:11:51.480]  People are killing themselves.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.341]  They are anxious.
[00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:53.201]  They are depressed.
[00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:54.743]  They are lonely.
[00:11:54.743 --> 00:11:58.787]  That is why we need to end it, more than any inconvenience that it's been to the rest of us.
[00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:02.668]  It's a pandemic.
[00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:06.409]  It's like at this point, it's a pandemic of bureaucracy.
[00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:09.150]  It's a pandemic of bureaucracy.
[00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.450]  It's not real anymore.
[00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:19.992]  History is repeating itself again with people power and common sense overriding tyrants, overriding mainstream media, overriding gaslighters.
[00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:24.473]  Yeah, it was a lonely place to be 23 months ago, being the first to expose this.
[00:12:24.473 --> 00:12:26.773]  And it's been a rough process throughout it, but I knew
[00:12:27.895 --> 00:12:33.158]  That InfoWars acts as the information warfare shock troops of truth.
[00:12:33.158 --> 00:12:39.863]  And it's our job to tell the hard facts up front when it's not popular and the public isn't informed.
[00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:45.046]  Because if we don't lay out these hard facts, nobody else is going to do it.
[00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:51.991]  And that's why all of you watching, all of you viewing this transmission, need to understand how valuable InfoWars is.
[00:12:52.850 --> 00:13:08.298]  And how valuable you've been in the last two years fighting with us and all the things you've done to spread our articles and spread our videos and to share so many other great Patriots information and Joe Rogan coming out against it and Tucker Carlson coming out against it.
[00:13:08.298 --> 00:13:12.000]  Though it took them about a year to get going once they saw the facts they did.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.321]  They are the trailblazers.
[00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:14.501]  You are the trailblazers.
[00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:17.963]  Infowars is the pioneer, the trailblazer.
[00:13:18.582 --> 00:13:20.624]  In standing up against evil.
[00:13:20.624 --> 00:13:26.488]  And this is an example to be used in the future when they launch other hoaxes and other power grabs.
[00:13:26.488 --> 00:13:32.972]  That no matter how it feels when you're all alone and you know you're right, you got to keep pushing and telling the truth.
[00:13:32.972 --> 00:13:34.674]  Take Aaron Rodgers.
[00:13:34.674 --> 00:13:44.861]  In that whole field of political operatives in the NFL, just like the NBA, there's not many people that come out and tell the truth about the COVID-19 power grab and the lies.
[00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:47.923]  But Aaron Rodgers and a handful of others in the NFL did.
[00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:51.455]  A handful of others in the NBA did.
[00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:54.161]  And now, they're more popular than ever.
[00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:55.905]  And the public loves them more than ever.
[00:13:55.905 --> 00:13:57.710]  And more importantly, they've been proven right.
[00:13:58.157 --> 00:14:02.540]  And Aaron Rodgers, in an interview he did just two days ago, really laid this out.
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:15.210]  He said, when in the course of human history has the side that's doing the censoring and trying to shut up people and make them show papers and marginalize a part of the community ever been the correct side?
[00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.374]  Rodgers said, yeah, these are the bad guys.
[00:14:19.374 --> 00:14:27.440]  The globalists are the criminals that were desperate because of nationalism, desperate because of Trumpism and populism, and in people waking up,
[00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:38.664]  So the Rockefeller Foundation always said in Operation Lockstep 2011 that they would launch a virus scare to bring in the tyranny you've now seen.
[00:14:38.664 --> 00:14:40.807]  It doesn't mean the tyranny is going to go away overnight.
[00:14:40.807 --> 00:14:47.314]  It doesn't mean that we're totally winning, but we're starting to win.
[00:14:47.314 --> 00:14:47.855]  So incredible.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.165]  He went on to make a lot of other very powerful statements, how 75% of those that died of COVID died of comorbidities.
[00:14:54.165 --> 00:14:55.886]  That was in 2020.
[00:14:55.886 --> 00:15:00.169]  But now people are dying from the vaccine sloughing and the vaccine itself.
[00:15:00.169 --> 00:15:04.492]  So another very, very important piece of information there.
[00:15:04.492 --> 00:15:12.359]  Now, I want to go to another important clip that really illustrates exactly what we're facing as a society.
[00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:18.063]  And that is from Robert Kennedy Jr., where he again explains that we never
[00:15:18.556 --> 00:15:21.097]  Comply our way out of tyranny.
[00:15:21.097 --> 00:15:23.558]  Compliance with tyranny is death.
[00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:25.799]  Resistance to tyranny is life.
[00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:29.321]  That's an Alex Jones equation, but it's historical fact.
[00:15:29.321 --> 00:15:42.907]  If you don't have a broken social contract, and society really is made up of mainly good people pushing for a good goal and not cold-blooded corporate eugenicists, then compliance with what makes sense is civilization.
[00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:43.688]  But there's a mix.
[00:15:43.688 --> 00:15:46.369]  You've always got to resist bad ideas or they take over.
[00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:54.774]  But in a system almost completely run by evil at the top, resistance is victory, compliance is death, and RFK Jr.
[00:15:54.774 --> 00:15:55.974]  really gets it.
[00:15:55.974 --> 00:16:08.740]  Is that every power that government acquires, using this pandemic as a pretense, it will ultimately abuse to the maximum effect possible.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.182]  And this is just a rule that is as certain as gravity.
[00:16:13.182 --> 00:16:14.723]  The third thing you need to know
[00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:22.190]  is that nobody has ever complied their way out of totalitarianism.
[00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:27.671]  Every time you comply, the demands will get greater and greater.
[00:16:27.671 --> 00:16:35.313]  We need to resolve, here and now, this is the hill that we need to die on.
[00:16:35.313 --> 00:16:41.255]  They have come for our jobs, they've come for our transport, now they're coming for our children.
[00:16:42.205 --> 00:16:45.928]  And we have an obligation as parents to protect them.
[00:16:45.928 --> 00:16:59.439]  There has never been a government in history that has told its people, we are going to demand that children sacrifice themselves and take risks to save old people.
[00:16:59.439 --> 00:17:02.541]  It's always the other way around.
[00:17:02.541 --> 00:17:09.647]  The old, the mature, the adults always put themselves at risk to protect their children.
[00:17:10.606 --> 00:17:12.348]  This is an ethical issue.
[00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:14.131]  It's a moral issue.
[00:17:14.131 --> 00:17:18.597]  It's an issue of character for each of us.
[00:17:18.597 --> 00:17:22.943]  And it's an issue about the preservation of democracy and public health.
[00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:26.609]  We all need to stand up now and do everything that we can.
[00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:44.549]  Again, the Davos Group is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:46.351]  People always ask me, what's globalism?
[00:17:46.351 --> 00:17:51.576]  It's a corporate consortium establishing a private corporate world government
[00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:58.678]  Whose aim is transhumanism and depopulation of those that aren't allowed to survive into the future.
[00:17:58.678 --> 00:18:08.203]  That's a very simple, real quote from Alex Jones about real politique of what these people actually represent very simply, very succinctly.
[00:18:08.203 --> 00:18:11.185]  And they're more powerful than the Chinese communists.
[00:18:11.185 --> 00:18:12.866]  They're more powerful than the Russians.
[00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:14.767]  They're more powerful than the Anglo-American establishment.
[00:18:15.185 --> 00:18:18.966]  Because they're in the shadows, but now they're out in the open.
[00:18:18.966 --> 00:18:32.049]  And last year, some of their top people met and were desperate, saying, oh, the elites, we're able to take over and do beautiful, wonderful things, but the more we get together, the more the evil public doesn't believe in us.
[00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:37.610]  Well, the answers obviously just kill off the general public or hit us with a disease to distract us.
[00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.790]  And this video is just now going viral.
[00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.711]  Paul Watson did a report on it.
[00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:43.551]  I'm about to air it here.
[00:18:45.089 --> 00:19:08.800]  Imagine someone calling themselves the elite and then saying we're building something so beautiful but they're not letting us do it and that's what I'm going to be covering on my Sunday show tomorrow is mainline international studies done by the UN and the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment and the usual suspects admitting that government and the corporations that control it
[00:19:09.696 --> 00:19:12.977]  are more hated and untrusted than ever before.
[00:19:12.977 --> 00:19:14.118]  But here's their answer.
[00:19:14.118 --> 00:19:19.100]  And they admit this in these white papers, like we're too dumb to understand it.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:28.803]  They say, we're going to carry out the destruction of the nation state and the basic liberties and freedoms enshrined in that and get rid of those mechanisms so that no one can oppose us.
[00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:33.985]  And to do that, we're going to blame all of our agendas on the world leaders.
[00:19:33.985 --> 00:19:38.107]  So as much as I don't like Joe Biden or Boris Johnson or
[00:19:38.966 --> 00:19:39.466]  I don't
[00:19:55.683 --> 00:19:58.085]  Remember, it's the people behind them controlling them.
[00:19:58.085 --> 00:20:02.668]  And by exposing the people behind the throne, you bring down their entire system.
[00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:05.950]  And so, I've explained this to you about Globalist.
[00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.212]  I've probably talked about this 500 times the last 20 years on air.
[00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:12.794]  I've had a chance to really read a lot of their writings and study them.
[00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:16.777]  But also, I've met with some of them when they tried to recruit me off record.
[00:20:16.777 --> 00:20:19.419]  And it's always the same spiel that she's giving you.
[00:20:19.419 --> 00:20:21.901]  We're building a beautiful future.
[00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:23.462]  We've got to do some tough things.
[00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:32.014]  Some controlled creative destruction to save the earth and to bring back survival of the fittest, Alex.
[00:20:32.014 --> 00:20:39.104]  And you're an elite and you need to join us and we're going to do beautiful things and we want you to be there with us, Alex.
[00:20:39.104 --> 00:20:40.406]  Now I've told you that's how they talk!
[00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:45.282]  She's now doing it as one of their top thinkers on a stage.
[00:20:45.282 --> 00:20:53.405]  Another one, the big Israeli futurist, says they're going to colonize all of us, whether we like it or not, with nanotech in our food.
[00:20:53.405 --> 00:21:00.388]  Something the FDA just started three months ago and said that they're not going to regulate it at all.
[00:21:00.388 --> 00:21:02.049]  There's GMO salmon on U.S.
[00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:07.911]  store shelves for a year that isn't labeled as part insect.
[00:21:07.911 --> 00:21:10.032]  I mean, the point is, it's Wild, Wild West, folks.
[00:21:10.984 --> 00:21:16.590]  And these people all have this attitude that they're enlightened and they're powerful and they're in control and they're not.
[00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:24.339]  They're just trying to take control of us to get us out of the way so we're not part of the decision-making process when they themselves are completely out of control.
[00:21:24.339 --> 00:21:26.361]  This is a very important clip.
[00:21:26.361 --> 00:21:27.362]  Here it is.
[00:21:27.362 --> 00:21:32.388]  World Economic Forum founder and world's number one Dr. Strangelove impersonator
[00:21:32.848 --> 00:21:54.924]  Klaus Schwab asked his fellow globalists a question during a recent summit about the stumbling blocks that are preventing their beneficent, all-loving, great reset agenda from coming to fruition, which fact-checkers have graciously reassured us has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with a secret plan by powerful technocrats to make themselves more powerful.
[00:21:54.924 --> 00:21:55.224]  And what
[00:21:55.384 --> 00:21:58.625]  What possible reason could we have to doubt their sincerity?
[00:21:58.625 --> 00:22:03.308]  But answering Schwab's question, this was the response from one of the panellists.
[00:22:08.979 --> 00:22:15.303]  That the good news is the elite across the world trust each other more and more.
[00:22:15.303 --> 00:22:19.146]  So we can come together and design and do beautiful things together.
[00:22:19.146 --> 00:22:26.852]  The bad news is that in every single country they were polling, the majority of people trusted that elite less.
[00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:34.639]  So, we can leave, but... That's Neri Woods, Professor of Global Economic Governance at the University of Oxford.
[00:22:34.639 --> 00:22:40.265]  The comments were actually made at the World Economic Forum's Great Narrative Conference back in November.
[00:22:40.265 --> 00:22:43.448]  Although the clip you just saw is going viral on Twitter right now.
[00:22:43.448 --> 00:22:46.171]  The majority of people trusted that elite less.
[00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:49.293]  Ordinary people not trusting the elite?
[00:22:49.293 --> 00:22:50.034]  Oh no!
[00:22:50.034 --> 00:22:51.455]  How dreadful!
[00:22:51.455 --> 00:22:53.276]  How could that possibly be?
[00:22:53.276 --> 00:23:00.441]  Could it have anything to do with the fact that the ultra-rich elite used the pandemic to enact the biggest wealth transfer in history?
[00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:03.883]  Widening wealth inequality to levels never seen before.
[00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:07.946]  As they raked in vast profits while small businesses went bust.
[00:23:07.946 --> 00:23:13.890]  In the UK alone, lockdown pushed 900,000 people into poverty while the rich got 54% richer.
[00:23:15.131 --> 00:23:24.994]  Could it have anything to do with elitists in countries across the world brazenly flouting the very same lockdown restrictions that they demanded be imposed on everyone else?
[00:23:24.994 --> 00:23:30.736]  Creating a new servant class of mask-wearing mutes while they parted it up totally maskless.
[00:23:30.736 --> 00:23:34.777]  Could it have anything to do with the elite buying remote luxury properties?
[00:23:34.777 --> 00:23:36.758]  In some cases, entire islands.
[00:23:36.758 --> 00:23:43.720]  To further distance themselves from the general public while we were told we weren't allowed to leave our tiny houses and apartments.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:52.985]  Could it have anything to do with the elite pressuring big tech to smear, silence and deplatform prominent people who question the corona narrative?
[00:23:52.985 --> 00:24:00.429]  Could it have anything to do with elitists laboriously lecturing us about our living standards, energy consumption and travel habits?
[00:24:00.589 --> 00:24:05.452]  After having arrived to do so on fleets of CO2 spewing private jets.
[00:24:05.452 --> 00:24:08.294]  Did it have anything to do with those who ask such questions?
[00:24:08.294 --> 00:24:11.956]  Being belittled, demonised and treated like trash.
[00:24:11.956 --> 00:24:15.498]  Also, referring to yourselves as the elite.
[00:24:15.498 --> 00:24:16.599]  Sounds pretty weird.
[00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:17.340]  The elite?
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.882]  Sounds like something a creepy aristocratic bad guy in an old Bond movie would say.
[00:24:21.882 --> 00:24:26.005]  And maybe, just maybe, that's why people don't trust you.
[00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:28.727]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[00:24:31.906 --> 00:24:36.368]  Now what have I been saying for the last two years?
[00:24:36.368 --> 00:24:38.068]  The globalists want their great reset.
[00:24:38.068 --> 00:24:40.789]  They want to collapse civilization.
[00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:42.670]  They want total control in their own words.
[00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:44.250]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing.
[00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:59.896]  And if we don't get the average bureaucrat, and the average FBI agent, and the average school teacher, and the average newspaper writer, and the average auto mechanic, the average farmer, the average Walmart worker, the average psychologist, if we don't get
[00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:24.859]  The average preacher to understand that globalism is about taking things away from people, not to build a better earth or save the planet, but so that people are so poor and so dumbed down and so starving, the globalists can then dictate the terms of our surrender, which is a global social credit score to put the chains on even tighter to then carry out forced sterilization and then extermination.
[00:25:24.859 --> 00:25:25.959]  That's all out in the open now.
[00:25:25.959 --> 00:25:29.620]  So going along with this only makes life worse.
[00:25:30.782 --> 00:25:36.968]  Going along with this only makes things more dystopic.
[00:25:36.968 --> 00:25:40.471]  And so I've talked about how are they planning to keep control of us?
[00:25:40.471 --> 00:25:53.344]  Launching wars, devaluing our currencies, making us poor, creating racial and cultural divisions, divide and conquer, releasing viruses to bring in scanning and passport controls and vaccine passports for the social credit score platform.
[00:25:56.135 --> 00:26:12.890]  And massive cyber attacks blamed on terrorists where they turn the power systems off to knock out most of their media competition and internet competition so they can bring in a new global digital currency that the Federal Reserve has now announced they could roll out at any time.
[00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.853]  So to bring in the new system, you've got to crash the old system.
[00:26:15.853 --> 00:26:17.315]  And the Dabos Group, i.e.
[00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:20.858]  the Bilderberg Group, has been telegraphing that that's their next phase.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:29.784]  They're also telegraphing that they're going to have carbon lockdowns to save the earth and major cities and places like India have now already been doing it.
[00:26:29.784 --> 00:26:35.448]  So they've done their virus attack, but now they know folks are aware of that scam.
[00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:38.630]  So they're going to back off on that to only launch a bunch of new attacks.
[00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.292]  And so as much good news as I gave you earlier,
[00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:43.659]  Folks, you need to get ready.
[00:26:43.659 --> 00:26:44.840]  You need to get prepared.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.402]  You need to get right with God.
[00:26:46.402 --> 00:26:48.203]  You need to have a self-defense plan.
[00:26:48.203 --> 00:26:49.625]  You need to have storable food.
[00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:50.766]  You need to have water filtration.
[00:26:50.766 --> 00:27:01.195]  You need to have neighbors and friends that are awake and know what's going on to have a mutual aid agreement to take care of each other with what's coming up.
[00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:01.736]  And finally,
[00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:05.512]  I already mentioned social unrest divide and conquer.
[00:27:05.512 --> 00:27:08.155]  You do not want any offensive violence.
[00:27:08.155 --> 00:27:11.139]  You could arrest all of Congress, it wouldn't fix our problems.
[00:27:11.139 --> 00:27:13.582]  You could fire everybody at the Justice Department, it wouldn't fix the problems.
[00:27:14.554 --> 00:27:24.039]  You could change all the judges around, but unless we become aware of the globalists and the big corporations and how they're manipulating our countries off against each other, we'll never fix it.
[00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:28.321]  We've got to take our cities, our counties, our states back, our nations back.
[00:27:28.321 --> 00:27:30.482]  We've got to take our corporations back.
[00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.683]  We've got to take our lives back.
[00:27:32.683 --> 00:27:37.945]  And then we have a chance of beating this peacefully by a global awakening.
[00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:42.808]  The globalists want all sorts of regional conflicts and fights and civil wars.
[00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:54.371]  To again, further destabilize and crash confidence in systems because they want the nation states to go down all at once basically to bring in their new global corporate governance.
[00:27:54.371 --> 00:28:03.140]  And that's why they're racing to get their social credit score vaccine passport apps in to act as the new digital currency platform.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.142]  This is their admitted plan.
[00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:06.844]  It's what they're doing and it's happening now.
[00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:11.910]  That leads me to these huge reports right here.
[00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:22.714]  Giant pallets, billions of dollars of anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, you name it, being delivered and being put on the U.S.
[00:28:22.714 --> 00:28:26.195]  State Department Twitter website.
[00:28:26.195 --> 00:28:28.316]  Masses of U.S.
[00:28:28.316 --> 00:28:33.278]  and NATO troops forming all around the borders with Ukraine.
[00:28:34.637 --> 00:28:39.559]  While telling you that Russia is imminently about to invade Ukraine.
[00:28:39.559 --> 00:28:44.161]  The reason Russia's building troops up is they see the buildup of the West.
[00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:49.384]  Russia doesn't have a history since the early 1980s of invading any country.
[00:28:49.384 --> 00:28:56.207]  They came in with Trump's support and helped knock out Al-Qaeda and others out of Syria and then they left.
[00:28:56.207 --> 00:28:59.068]  I'm not saying Russia's perfect.
[00:28:59.068 --> 00:29:00.309]  I'm a loyal American.
[00:29:00.309 --> 00:29:03.290]  But we have globalists that hate our country that are running into the ground
[00:29:03.933 --> 00:29:09.594]  that are telling us that there is an imminent Russian attack and Russia is saying we are not about to attack.
[00:29:09.594 --> 00:29:10.495]  There are U.S.
[00:29:10.495 --> 00:29:19.077]  troops building up and bringing weapons in, not just along our border with Ukraine, but along other borders like Poland and other areas and the U.S.
[00:29:19.077 --> 00:29:20.357]  admits it.
[00:29:20.357 --> 00:29:21.717]  And why are you doing this?
[00:29:21.717 --> 00:29:23.318]  Of course we're massing troops.
[00:29:23.318 --> 00:29:26.059]  You're massing troops on our border.
[00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:31.600]  But the same gas lighters are telling us again that Russia is the aggressor.
[00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:33.119]  U.S.
[00:29:33.119 --> 00:29:47.429]  Embassy orders evacuation of non-essential staff, diplomats, family members from Ukraine, saying they believe there's an imminent attack by Russia and saying they believe Russia will stage a terror attack on their own forces on the border as a pretext for attacking.
[00:29:47.429 --> 00:29:51.611]  Well, the globalists always invert and project what they're doing.
[00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:53.072]  They have the history.
[00:29:53.072 --> 00:29:53.893]  They have the motive.
[00:29:53.893 --> 00:29:55.794]  They've massed the troops first.
[00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:56.635]  So I would look for them.
[00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:03.262]  To attack Russian forces so that when Russian forces defend themselves, they'll claim it's a false flag.
[00:30:03.262 --> 00:30:17.885]  Or to attack Ukrainian forces and to say that Russia did it and then a major war is launched and now you have Biden's 2022 midterm election plan to get Americans unified behind a proxy war with Russia.
[00:30:17.885 --> 00:30:21.966]  Total and absolute, complete insanity and evil.
[00:30:24.457 --> 00:30:33.983]  I have two more things I want to hit and that's it for this Emergency Saturday News Alert that I hope you'll share and that I hope you'll get out to others because that's how we have a great effect.
[00:30:33.983 --> 00:30:37.505]  You as a regular listener are one of the most precious people in the world.
[00:30:37.505 --> 00:30:38.205]  You care.
[00:30:38.205 --> 00:30:38.985]  You're involved.
[00:30:38.985 --> 00:30:41.547]  You're watching this on a Saturday or a Sunday.
[00:30:41.547 --> 00:30:44.028]  You're the person that shares it on Twitter or Facebook.
[00:30:44.028 --> 00:30:46.290]  You're the person that takes clips out and posts it.
[00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.531]  You're the person that emails it to friends and family.
[00:30:48.531 --> 00:30:51.172]  You're the person that sends it out on text message.
[00:30:51.172 --> 00:30:51.853]  You're everything.
[00:30:53.103 --> 00:30:54.323]  It's like I'm paralyzed.
[00:30:54.323 --> 00:30:59.484]  If my brain gives the order and the nerve endings are cut, we don't have any effect.
[00:30:59.484 --> 00:31:04.445]  But if you decide to take action, then the whole body operates and we have victory.
[00:31:04.445 --> 00:31:09.787]  So take this report and share it from futurenews.news.
[00:31:09.787 --> 00:31:12.887]  They're already censoring freeworldnews.tv and ban.video.
[00:31:12.887 --> 00:31:20.409]  Futurenews.news is the URL to share it on Twitter and Facebook and all those other places so it won't get blocked and you won't get banned.
[00:31:20.842 --> 00:31:23.563]  On your email, on your text message, share it from wherever you like.
[00:31:23.563 --> 00:31:26.664]  Whatever you do, just get it out, please.
[00:31:26.664 --> 00:31:29.585]  Alright, one more report I want to get to, but first this.
[00:31:29.585 --> 00:31:36.067]  And this comes from Mainstream News, and this hits really close to home.
[00:31:36.067 --> 00:31:41.429]  This is out of Dallas-Fort Worth, CBS Local.
[00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:49.332]  And this is my frustration, a year ago at this time, almost a year ago, six days before a giant
[00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:56.634]  Blue Northern Polar Vortex was going to be coming down.
[00:31:56.634 --> 00:32:15.267]  The National Weather Survey, NOAA, told Texas, you're going to have serious freezing temperatures and you better get your power output up because people are going to double and triple their power usage and it's going to cause your system to go down.
[00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:19.190]  The state of Texas, four days before the blizzard hit, sent messages
[00:32:20.151 --> 00:32:41.077]  To the Biden administration in early February and said, we need authorization to turn up our gas plants and our coal plants because the solar plants and the windmills will not deliver enough power even if there wasn't a storm.
[00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:47.176]  The federal government refused the emergency authorization.
[00:32:47.176 --> 00:32:53.419]  Under law, you've got to get authorization and pay millions a day in fines, or you go to prison.
[00:32:53.419 --> 00:32:57.641]  You get indicted.
[00:32:57.641 --> 00:33:04.024]  Now I showed you those letters from this studio with one light and a generator going, barely able to stay on air.
[00:33:04.024 --> 00:33:05.825]  We were down for half a day.
[00:33:05.825 --> 00:33:08.527]  Because after 10 hours, our generators ran out of power.
[00:33:08.527 --> 00:33:09.307]  They were battery.
[00:33:09.307 --> 00:33:10.608]  Now we have big diesel generators.
[00:33:12.096 --> 00:33:18.283]  The point is, let me just start over like this because this is so damn big.
[00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:31.658]  Ladies and gentlemen, they shut down over a thousand coal power plants that are totally clean and only put out water vapor and carbon dioxide in the last 12 years.
[00:33:31.658 --> 00:33:32.920]  They're shutting down the last ones now.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.722]  Natural gas freezes up during a cold storm and it has trouble operating.
[00:33:38.722 --> 00:33:40.402]  Windmills totally freeze up.
[00:33:40.402 --> 00:33:41.743]  What are you supposed to operate on?
[00:33:41.743 --> 00:33:43.684]  The answer is you don't.
[00:33:43.684 --> 00:33:56.029]  Here I was, eleven and a half months ago, reading the actual state of Texas statements about let us turn our power on and the feds said no.
[00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:57.670]  They wouldn't even let Texas pay the fines.
[00:33:59.693 --> 00:34:22.239]  And now, here we are, 11 and a half months later, and I got CBS News acting like a power company's bad, because they're telling Dallas and Fort Worth to prepare to have no power, because the federal government will not authorize them upping their power, and because they're not going to pay $25 million fines a day.
[00:34:26.806 --> 00:34:34.389]  You can go watch CBS News in Dallas reporting it like the company's bad.
[00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:38.011]  And this is a natural gas company.
[00:34:38.011 --> 00:34:43.213]  So here I am waiting for the next big cold front to hit and the damn lights to go off again.
[00:34:43.213 --> 00:34:47.595]  And I guess my crew will be living here because we've at least got diesel and an extra tank of it.
[00:34:47.595 --> 00:34:49.056]  I don't know for how long.
[00:34:49.056 --> 00:34:52.357]  And the media a year ago wouldn't tell the truth.
[00:34:52.357 --> 00:34:53.838]  Will they tell the truth now?
[00:34:53.838 --> 00:34:55.519]  You read this article, it doesn't even explain that.
[00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:01.413]  Pipeline Company threatening to cut off natural gas service to five Texas power plants.
[00:35:01.413 --> 00:35:07.137]  Headline should be, Power Company told by Feds they can't operate during storm.
[00:35:07.137 --> 00:35:09.778]  Feds refuse to allow Power Company to up power.
[00:35:09.778 --> 00:35:12.520]  Because when you go read the article, it's the truth.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:20.805]  And they say, oh yeah, they're not given an emergency authorization and so they're not going to do it.
[00:35:20.805 --> 00:35:24.908]  The Feds are ordering it turned off.
[00:35:24.908 --> 00:35:25.428]  It goes on.
[00:35:26.775 --> 00:35:40.386]  The pipeline company, Emergency Transfer LP, which is run by Dallas billionaire Kelly Warren, says Luminant needs to pay $21 million in penalties for oversupplying natural gas during the last deadly freeze.
[00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.552]  The feds don't let you turn the power on.
[00:35:42.552 --> 00:35:43.232]  21 million, 25 million.
[00:35:43.232 --> 00:35:47.993]  Some days they were paying fines higher than that because they went ahead and operated with the fines.
[00:35:47.993 --> 00:35:49.294]  That's what's going on.
[00:35:49.294 --> 00:35:50.074]  That's what's happening.
[00:35:50.074 --> 00:35:51.995]  And we live in idiocracy
[00:36:09.815 --> 00:36:15.017]  If we can't get to the point where people understand that this is the Great Reset, this is the carbon shutdown.
[00:36:15.017 --> 00:36:18.138]  Remember the head of the Department of Energy who said like two months ago?
[00:36:18.138 --> 00:36:21.500]  She goes, oh yeah, we could cut gas prices, but we don't want to.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.121]  We're in a transition showing you not to drive those cars.
[00:36:25.121 --> 00:36:29.563]  Well, electric cars use as much carbon as gas cars on average, or more.
[00:36:30.387 --> 00:36:32.308]  The average leftist goes, what do you mean it's electricity?
[00:36:32.308 --> 00:36:35.591]  Where do you think the electricity came from, jackass?
[00:36:35.591 --> 00:36:44.117]  From the combustion of the fossil fuel, then it's got to go down long power lines where it loses half the power on average.
[00:36:44.117 --> 00:36:49.921]  The damn windmills in West Texas lose up to 70% of their power before they get to Austin.
[00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:53.365]  It doesn't freaking work.
[00:36:53.365 --> 00:36:56.308]  Exploding the energy in the car is where it works.
[00:36:56.308 --> 00:36:59.352]  Because you get 100% of it if you got a new engine.
[00:36:59.352 --> 00:37:02.335]  100% of the energy when it's there.
[00:37:02.335 --> 00:37:06.560]  Electricity came down a line and it sits in there.
[00:37:08.175 --> 00:37:10.698]  I just have to explain some of the stuff to the left.
[00:37:10.698 --> 00:37:11.839]  There's no helping him.
[00:37:11.839 --> 00:37:20.568]  Just remember, when the power's out, we have enrolling blackouts, the government has blocked us claiming that anything that has carbon is evil when your very body's made out of carbon.
[00:37:20.568 --> 00:37:22.070]  Alright, here's the final big report.
[00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.751]  Again, I appreciate you all watching.
[00:37:24.482 --> 00:37:28.206]  This is an extremely important video that Gregory's put out.
[00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:32.731]  Evidence that the US government targeted red states with bad vaccines.
[00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:36.295]  This is exactly what the evidence shows is going on.
[00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:39.419]  And I'll see you, Lord willing, tomorrow on the Sunday Show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.781]  Pray for peace in Russia.
[00:37:41.781 --> 00:37:42.841]  Pray for peace in Europe.
[00:37:42.841 --> 00:37:44.382]  Pray for peace here.
[00:37:44.382 --> 00:37:46.804]  Good job to everybody fighting the COVID fraud.
[00:37:46.804 --> 00:37:51.967]  It's really starting to bear fruit and it's an example for us to never give up in the future when we face more of these globalist operations.
[00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:58.131]  And until we expose the globalists and arrest the globalists and bring them to justice, we're going to continue fighting their projects.
[00:37:58.131 --> 00:38:04.114]  But starting to defeat one of their major Hydra heads is still a major victory, so I salute you all.
[00:38:04.114 --> 00:38:05.175]  God bless and good luck.
[00:38:13.337 --> 00:38:25.845]  Ex-Head of Respiratory Research at Pfizer, Mike Yeadon, and researchers including Craig Pardecouper, have sourced VAERS data on vaccine death and injury in the U.S.
[00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:34.110]  A database of over 700,000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen vaccines.
[00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:39.554]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as LOTS.
[00:38:40.194 --> 00:38:48.017]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back-engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the U.S.
[00:38:48.017 --> 00:38:54.520]  All their information is published at howbadismybatch.com and howbad.info.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.021]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[00:38:57.021 --> 00:39:07.426]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic, resulting in hospitalization, disability, and death within days or weeks of injection.
[00:39:08.286 --> 00:39:14.330]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:23.837]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[00:39:25.003 --> 00:39:39.227]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment to perform dose range finding, or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[00:39:39.227 --> 00:39:50.830]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:59.414]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates, and only certain lots are included.
[00:39:59.414 --> 00:40:04.356]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[00:40:04.356 --> 00:40:10.279]  Which makes sense, there would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo.
[00:40:10.279 --> 00:40:11.260]  Only the deadly ones.
[00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:22.049]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:31.577]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[00:40:32.702 --> 00:40:38.668]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[00:40:38.668 --> 00:40:44.693]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[00:40:44.693 --> 00:40:55.243]  After ruling out other possibilities, Parda-Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did.
[00:40:57.071 --> 00:41:09.118]  Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who voted against the New World Order's woke, Build Back Better, Great Reset.
[00:41:09.118 --> 00:41:15.362]  While at the same time, endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners.
[00:41:15.362 --> 00:41:18.504]  And it's happening right now.
[00:41:18.504 --> 00:41:20.565]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:41:35.506 --> 00:41:38.569]  Thank you for watching the latest Greg Reiss Report.

[00:41:56.604 --> 00:42:06.775]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:12.568]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[00:42:12.568 --> 00:42:15.690]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.551]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:22.314]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[00:42:22.314 --> 00:42:30.759]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[00:42:30.759 --> 00:42:33.981]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[00:42:33.981 --> 00:42:34.482]  So be it.
[00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.853]  Make them silence us by force.
[00:42:37.853 --> 00:42:40.856]  This is the final battle of the information war.
[00:42:40.856 --> 00:42:42.137]  Give now.
[00:42:42.137 --> 00:42:43.639]  Buy products.
[00:42:43.639 --> 00:42:44.840]  Donate.
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.682]  Before everything changes.
[00:42:46.682 --> 00:42:49.505]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[00:42:49.505 --> 00:42:50.866]  Victory or death.
[00:42:50.866 --> 00:42:52.708]  Go now to infowarestore.com
