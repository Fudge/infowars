[00:00.000 --> 00:26.400]  It's Sunday, June 19th, 2022, Father's Day.
[00:26.400 --> 00:29.760]  And I want to salute not just the fathers of the US and the fathers around the world,
[00:29.760 --> 00:33.680]  but all the parents and the grandparents and the aunts and the uncles and the brothers
[00:33.680 --> 00:39.000]  and the sisters and others that have stood together for our children and our human family
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.520]  going into the future.
[00:40.520 --> 00:45.240]  The globalists are attacking the human structure at every level, but not just humans are being
[00:45.240 --> 00:46.240]  targeted.
[00:46.240 --> 00:52.440]  The entire biosphere and carbon, the very basis of life forms on this planet, is being
[00:52.440 --> 00:58.080]  outlawed and curtailed as we speak by the forces of the New World Order.
[00:58.080 --> 01:03.400]  Now on this special Father's Day edition, we're going to cover some of the giant developments
[01:03.400 --> 01:05.720]  that are unfolding.
[01:05.720 --> 01:10.720]  First off, it is now admitted that the stock markets, the world are being purposely crashed
[01:10.720 --> 01:11.720]  to consolidate control.
[01:11.720 --> 01:17.760]  It is admitted on record that the large central banks have issued quadrillions of currency
[01:17.760 --> 01:25.320]  to create a massive devaluation as a political weapon or a form of neo-futilism to make everybody
[01:25.320 --> 01:29.400]  dependent and bring us to our knees to bring in the new global digital currency.
[01:29.400 --> 01:33.520]  The Federal Reserve announced last week that we told you for decades was coming that will
[01:33.520 --> 01:39.760]  be tied to all of your political, cultural and spiritual and economic activity with
[01:39.760 --> 01:44.840]  the social credit score enforced via the carbon tax and the vaccine passport system.
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.840]  There's been a big development I'll be covering next segment and that's Amazon is creating
[01:49.840 --> 01:57.240]  an insider club now, we have to sign up and pay money to be able to buy staple goods in
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.240]  the future.
[01:58.240 --> 02:05.880]  Translation, they're preparing for open food shortages and food rationing.
[02:05.880 --> 02:06.880]  That's coming up.
[02:06.880 --> 02:11.800]  Obviously, it's a big story that Joe Biden fell down again, came to a complete stop and
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.800]  then just fell over and then hopped around later that day to show everybody how incredibly
[02:17.800 --> 02:19.600]  agile he is.
[02:19.600 --> 02:22.800]  The man is emblematic of the design collapse of America.
[02:22.800 --> 02:26.280]  He was put there to take the blame for the collapse when it is the global that are orchestrating
[02:26.280 --> 02:27.680]  it all.
[02:27.680 --> 02:31.640]  It's key to make that fact, doesn't mean we like Joe Biden, doesn't mean we don't want
[02:31.640 --> 02:36.680]  to impeach him, doesn't mean we don't discredit him, but we have to understand he is nothing
[02:36.680 --> 02:40.640]  but the distraction or the red cape that the Matador puts out in front of the bull.
[02:40.640 --> 02:46.440]  It is the Matador and the sword he holds in his hand that is the real threat and this
[02:46.440 --> 02:49.760]  entire broadcast is about exposing that.
[02:49.760 --> 02:54.360]  Obviously we'll be covering it in more detail coming up, but out of all the big issues we're
[02:54.360 --> 02:57.720]  breaking down here, the most central is this.
[02:57.720 --> 03:00.600]  We'll be covering it at the start of the next segment.
[03:00.600 --> 03:09.560]  The Moderna shot, the same contents mRNA gene therapy as the Pfizer, but three times stronger
[03:09.560 --> 03:14.160]  has been authorized for six months and up.
[03:14.160 --> 03:20.160]  Now schools in blue state and blue city areas are claiming it's mandatory.
[03:20.160 --> 03:24.120]  This is an unprecedented crossing of the Rubicon.
[03:24.120 --> 03:27.440]  It's admitted that it doesn't work, it's admitted that it erases your immune system,
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.640]  it's admitted that it causes all sorts of blood clots and permanently infects not just
[03:32.640 --> 03:38.160]  the DNA of the child, but that will pass it on into future generations.
[03:38.160 --> 03:44.800]  This is part of a larger plan tied directly to infertility and sterilization.
[03:44.800 --> 03:53.080]  This is the long-term UN project to develop a vaccine to lower human population.
[03:53.080 --> 04:00.160]  You can just search engine on the UN's own website, birth control vaccines, and you'll
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.640]  see decades and decades of research and more than a hundred different shots that they call
[04:05.640 --> 04:13.200]  vaccines that have been developed to target fertility and to lower fertility or erase
[04:13.200 --> 04:14.720]  fertility in humans.
[04:14.720 --> 04:18.080]  They also have so-called vaccines that they've been giving different animals for decades
[04:18.080 --> 04:19.520]  that do the same thing.
[04:19.520 --> 04:21.480]  That's what this is.
[04:21.480 --> 04:22.480]  That's coming up.
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.120]  Also, the EPA came out on Thursday and said, hey, guess what?
[04:27.120 --> 04:31.240]  There's a lot of really deadly chemicals in the water.
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.080]  Even though we say that the EPA and FDA, that these are at safe levels, that they're really
[04:36.080 --> 04:39.680]  not at safe levels, and they're causing what?
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.400]  Infertility, cancer, all sorts of gender confusion and more.
[04:44.400 --> 04:48.200]  Yes, the chemicals in the water aren't just making the frogs gay.
[04:48.200 --> 04:50.200]  It's sterilizing them and it's sterilizing us.
[04:50.200 --> 05:00.760]  We'll be right back on the other side, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.760 --> 05:06.400]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[05:06.400 --> 05:07.840]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.080]  Well, it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[05:12.080 --> 05:17.800]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important
[05:17.800 --> 05:24.000]  than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.600]  It's now out in the open.
[05:25.600 --> 05:31.160]  Paul Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.160]  Group.
[05:32.160 --> 05:35.160]  So now, the fight's out in the open.
[05:35.160 --> 05:38.360]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[05:38.360 --> 05:39.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[05:39.360 --> 05:40.360]  God's watching.
[05:40.360 --> 05:41.360]  The children are counting on us.
[05:41.360 --> 05:45.000]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.480]  your financial support because without you, infowars would not be here.
[05:48.480 --> 05:52.760]  I just want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are
[05:52.760 --> 05:55.120]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[05:55.120 --> 05:59.680]  I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[05:59.680 --> 06:26.560]  your efforts.
[06:29.680 --> 06:38.120]  It's Sunday, June 22nd, 2022.
[06:38.120 --> 06:42.440]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast.
[06:42.440 --> 06:48.320]  We have some very dire announcements to make here that when you put them in context with
[06:48.320 --> 06:53.120]  a larger picture, it becomes crystal clear that we are facing a planetary corporate
[06:53.120 --> 07:02.560]  fascist takeover whose in-game aim and final destination is forced mass depopulation.
[07:02.560 --> 07:04.680]  So let's start breaking it down right now.
[07:04.680 --> 07:11.840]  It's being reported by hundreds of newspapers very quietly that the WHO chief believes COVID
[07:11.840 --> 07:19.640]  did leak from Wuhan lab, that's the headline, after a catastrophic accident in 2019 despite
[07:19.640 --> 07:25.680]  publicly maintaining all hypothesis remains on the table.
[07:25.680 --> 07:30.240]  And if you go back just a few years ago, they would censor you and shut you down and kick
[07:30.240 --> 07:34.400]  you out of social media if you even mentioned that despite the fact that top scientists
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.320]  all over the world that scan the virus pointed out that it was man-made of five different
[07:39.320 --> 07:44.600]  viruses or chimeric and that Peter Dazek under Bill Gates and Fauci's funding have been developing
[07:44.600 --> 07:50.040]  the exact same groups of virus combinations in Chapel Hill, North Carolina going back
[07:50.040 --> 07:55.480]  in 2014-15 that the project was illegal so it was moved to communist China and they even
[07:55.480 --> 08:01.280]  specifically call it COVID-19 in their records a year before it was ever released or it was
[08:01.280 --> 08:04.160]  ever named COVID-19 officially.
[08:04.160 --> 08:07.440]  That's what's so frustrating about this is that they know this is all there so they're
[08:07.440 --> 08:15.600]  quietly letting little pieces out and so they're the fact checkers, corporate and governmental
[08:15.600 --> 08:22.240]  in big tech and big dinosaur media censoring and stopping anybody that tried to talk about
[08:22.240 --> 08:25.960]  this when we had total evidence and then calling his criminals and calling for our arrest and
[08:25.960 --> 08:32.320]  saying we're spreading fear and then now the EU is reporting that Tedros, the head of the
[08:32.320 --> 08:39.640]  World Health Organization, told them two years ago that he knew it came out of a lab in a
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.280]  catastrophic event whose chief police COVID-19 did leak from a lab after a catastrophic accident
[08:45.280 --> 08:50.600]  close quote 2019 despite publicly maintaining all hypotheses are made on the table.
[08:50.600 --> 08:56.080]  Well no, first they said it came out of the wet market out of the grocery store that had
[08:56.080 --> 08:59.880]  a lot of animals in it and then they said they didn't know where it came from.
[08:59.880 --> 09:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the documents from 2017 when the Pentagon was approached
[09:06.640 --> 09:12.680]  by Peter Dazik and this group saying we want to give you weaponized, aerosolized spike
[09:12.680 --> 09:18.000]  protein, we want to spray it in Chinese caves and the Pentagon said that would cause World
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.080]  War III with the communist Chinese, what are you talking about, that's a bioweapon attack.
[09:23.080 --> 09:27.680]  So they were trying to frame the Pentagon back then by trying to get them to be involved
[09:27.680 --> 09:32.400]  in this so when they all came out they could use it as blackmail against the US government
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.160]  but now they've just used it to blackmail the planet, cause massive lockdowns, bring
[09:37.160 --> 09:42.800]  out forced inoculations, bring out the World ID vaccine passport that's the platform for
[09:42.800 --> 09:46.680]  the world social credit score and carbon taxes.
[09:46.680 --> 09:51.440]  It's now all official, all announced, all there and how vindicated are we yet again
[09:51.440 --> 09:57.560]  that back in January of 2020 and February 2020, Info Wars was the first to break this
[09:57.560 --> 10:04.320]  information along with Zero Hedge and of course Dr. Francis Boyle but we're not taking victory
[10:04.320 --> 10:10.160]  labs because now that we're 30 plus months into this, they are simply moving on to the
[10:10.160 --> 10:16.720]  next phase and the next virus, they're going to release in the next lockdowns and the FDA
[10:16.720 --> 10:24.000]  quietly Friday said now we're going to give, notice on Friday evening, we're going to
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.720]  give children as young as six months old these experimental shots that they admit don't work
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.640]  and erase your immune system, this is so incredibly criminal and if you try to point
[10:34.640 --> 10:38.480]  out the studies that it actually hurts your immune system and makes you sick, well then
[10:38.480 --> 10:46.120]  they censor you as well and call it disinformation, this is truly criminal activity on a mass
[10:46.120 --> 10:47.360]  scale.
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.800]  Director General Tedros confided to a senior European official, the mail on Sunday first
[10:52.800 --> 10:56.960]  revealed concerns about Wuhan's Institute of Virology, worldwide death toll of COVID
[10:56.960 --> 11:01.760]  pandemic now has made it to be above 18 million, you got right from denying people basic treatment
[11:01.760 --> 11:08.480]  and vitamins who initially ran into lab like fears and conspiracy theory accepting China's
[11:08.480 --> 11:09.480]  official story.
[11:09.480 --> 11:14.600]  So the globalists moved their legal program to China so they could then have plausible
[11:14.600 --> 11:18.560]  liability and blame who they wanted for the release if it ever came out that indeed they
[11:18.560 --> 11:19.560]  did release it.
[11:19.560 --> 11:24.760]  This is the crime of the millennium and we must have congressional hearings, we must
[11:24.760 --> 11:30.520]  have Fauci holed up on lying to Congress, he must be indicted, the House of Cards must
[11:30.520 --> 11:34.160]  come down or the same group of criminals is going to continue to launch these types of
[11:34.160 --> 11:39.480]  attacks over and over again until we stop them and they're gearing up and getting ready
[11:39.480 --> 11:40.480]  for another one.
[11:40.480 --> 11:45.080]  So think of the value of enforce, think of the value of what you've done supporting us
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.760]  and keeping us on the air over the years because we have been the main center of resistance
[11:50.760 --> 11:55.680]  to these criminals and what they've done and remember all the censors and all the leftist
[11:55.680 --> 12:00.160]  media and all the trolls that bullied you and bullied us and attacked us and fought
[12:00.160 --> 12:06.200]  to censor us and shut us down and tried to silence us, they now all have blood on their
[12:06.200 --> 12:11.840]  hands with this as well and remember the lockdowns, the UN estimates have killed more than 40
[12:11.840 --> 12:18.440]  million people from starvation alone, millions more from suicide, millions more from complications
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.120]  of malnutrition and they all have blood on their hands.
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.280]  They launched a very recent, they're the ones trying to build on our ashes their new system
[12:28.280 --> 12:33.560]  and now they're coming with the Moderna shot that is three times stronger than the Pfizer
[12:33.560 --> 12:40.040]  shot, the exact same mRNA system to devastate six month olds and up.
[12:40.040 --> 12:47.840]  This is just unprecedented depopulation, unprecedented evil and we must not let it continue.
[12:47.840 --> 12:52.840]  They hope that because we're 30 months after they launched the first attack that everybody
[12:52.840 --> 12:59.000]  just goes back to sleep now and forgets that this happened and just has no memory.
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.240]  The globalist engineers, the social engineers are counting on you not having a memory but
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.920]  you do have a memory.
[13:06.920 --> 13:11.560]  So what's interesting as Joe Biden is falling off bikes and stumbling upstairs and falling
[13:11.560 --> 13:16.040]  downstairs and not knowing who he is, he's just a puppet and it is the UN, it is the
[13:16.040 --> 13:20.880]  big banks, it is the big corporations that are anti free market that are medical, biomedical
[13:20.880 --> 13:24.400]  tyrants that want to have control of our bodies and literally rape our rights and our freedom
[13:24.400 --> 13:29.040]  of health, they are the ones that have authored this, they are the ones that are guilty of
[13:29.040 --> 13:33.080]  this and they are the ones that must be brought to justice for this.
[13:33.080 --> 13:38.120]  I want to take over for the balance of this segment and the next and I'll be back at the
[13:38.120 --> 13:44.040]  bottom of the hour with other key reports but this is just so insane and I want to thank
[13:44.040 --> 13:49.200]  and salute all of you for sharing the articles and videos and reports that first broke at
[13:49.200 --> 13:54.520]  info wars.com and banned on video because without your action, the globalist would not be on
[13:54.520 --> 13:58.200]  their heels right now, would not be running scared and would not be pointing fingers at
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.880]  each other, they would just be moving forward with the same old lie that, oh, it came out
[14:01.880 --> 14:07.840]  of the rainforest because of global warming or, oh, you know, it's because the unvaccinated
[14:07.840 --> 14:14.040]  got people sick or, oh, it came out of a wet market, no, it came out of their bio weapons
[14:14.040 --> 14:19.160]  labs and we have the proof, we have the genetic scans and we have the facts that they use
[14:19.160 --> 14:23.840]  that release to then grab power and control and launch the expansion of the new world
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.840]  order.
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.840]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.
[14:25.840 --> 14:26.840]  I want to take over.
[14:26.840 --> 14:27.840]  I'm going to be back with more news.
[14:27.840 --> 14:29.840]  I want to just thank all the listeners for your support.
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.920]  I want to encourage you again to take the archive of this live feed once it's posted
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.360]  at man.video and to share it and tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, perfect
[14:38.360 --> 14:39.360]  strangers.
[14:39.360 --> 14:42.080]  See, we were right, vindicated again.
[14:42.080 --> 14:48.680]  We've been vindicated on so many fronts and we are only going to be captured in this
[14:48.680 --> 14:54.240]  tyrannical system at a higher level of tyranny until we continue to hammer this issue.
[14:54.240 --> 14:55.880]  They're losing this fight right now.
[14:55.880 --> 14:58.440]  The fact that they launched this attack is coming out.
[14:58.440 --> 15:02.560]  But if we don't press the attack and the information war and get it out, they're going to launch
[15:02.560 --> 15:03.560]  new attacks.
[15:03.560 --> 15:09.280]  Separately, we have the ultimate immune system package, four amazing products that will bring
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.440]  your immune system to the next level for 60% off at infowarstore.com to get them together.
[15:14.440 --> 15:19.120]  We also have the info wars trifecta immune system boost with three of those great products
[15:19.120 --> 15:24.320]  at 50% off and of course, we also have X2 back in stock that's so key if your immune system
[15:24.320 --> 15:27.080]  is more for 40% off and that also keeps us on the air.
[15:27.080 --> 15:28.080]  So thank you for the support.
[15:28.080 --> 15:34.880]  Now, support yourselves and support your body and be healthy at infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com.
[15:34.880 --> 16:00.280]  We'll go to break and come back with Owen Shroyer.
[16:00.280 --> 16:25.680]  The
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.680]  said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos group.
[16:31.680 --> 16:34.680]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[16:34.680 --> 16:37.880]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[16:37.880 --> 16:38.880]  We're going to win this thing.
[16:38.880 --> 16:39.880]  God's watching.
[16:39.880 --> 16:40.880]  The children are counting on us.
[16:40.880 --> 16:44.520]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[16:44.520 --> 16:47.960]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.
[16:47.960 --> 16:52.360]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[16:52.360 --> 16:54.640]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[16:54.640 --> 16:59.160]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[16:59.160 --> 17:01.840]  your efforts.
[17:01.840 --> 17:04.080]  Info wars has made history.
[17:04.080 --> 17:08.200]  You have made history in your support of info wars and one of the biggest tools we've had
[17:08.200 --> 17:13.800]  to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot apparel so we can identify each
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.640]  other so we can spread the word and so we can push people to websites like info wars.com
[17:18.640 --> 17:21.600]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[17:21.600 --> 17:24.840]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.560]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[17:28.560 --> 17:29.840]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[17:29.840 --> 17:34.040]  They're about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.040]  wardrobe.
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.320]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left in a couple weeks.
[17:39.320 --> 17:41.240]  They'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[17:41.240 --> 17:47.840]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com so thank you all for your support.
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.200]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves,

[17:57.480 --> 17:58.480]  Infowarstore.com.
[17:58.480 --> 17:59.480]  Look at that.
[17:59.480 --> 18:04.480]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured.
[18:04.480 --> 18:05.480]  It's been marked down.
[18:05.480 --> 18:06.480]  We didn't do that.
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.120]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can
[18:12.120 --> 18:13.120]  get?
[18:13.120 --> 18:14.840]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.

[18:20.880 --> 18:24.080]  I want that good will.
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.080]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[18:27.080 --> 18:29.880]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[18:29.880 --> 18:31.880]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[18:31.880 --> 18:38.880]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[18:38.880 --> 18:49.960]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.520]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil just like

[20:00.880 --> 20:28.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:28.680 --> 20:40.840]  And we take you now into the Info Wars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[20:40.840 --> 20:48.080]  Is it a big deal that Joe Biden falls down the flight of stairs walking up to Air Force
[20:48.080 --> 20:50.800]  One not once but twice?
[20:50.800 --> 20:58.280]  Is it a big deal that Joe Biden has to switch shoes to a pair of special geriatric shoes
[20:58.280 --> 21:03.160]  when he is at a European trip and conference?
[21:03.160 --> 21:11.360]  Is it a big story that Joe Biden craps his britches and needs to change diapers when he's
[21:11.360 --> 21:13.760]  meeting the Pope?
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.480]  Is it a big story all of his gaffes?
[21:15.480 --> 21:18.120]  He forgets where he is.
[21:18.120 --> 21:26.080]  He's constantly mush-mouthing it, marble-mouthing it, saying things that don't make any sense
[21:26.080 --> 21:28.640]  lying through his teeth.
[21:28.640 --> 21:35.400]  Is it a big deal that Joe Biden goes on vacation every weekend to Delaware where he's riding
[21:35.400 --> 21:43.040]  around on a bike and now falls over as he's approaching the media?
[21:43.040 --> 21:45.040]  Is any of it a big deal?
[21:45.040 --> 21:47.600]  Well, no.
[21:47.600 --> 21:55.040]  As isolated incidents, and it's not a secret that Joe Biden is suffering from severe dementia
[21:55.040 --> 22:08.760]  and Parkinson's and who knows what else, but the thing that is a big deal is that every
[22:08.760 --> 22:16.360]  day that the Democrats and the American Left refuse to try to re-chart their course to
[22:16.360 --> 22:21.320]  get back on the map and get back to reality and get back to common sense and get back
[22:21.320 --> 22:32.040]  to integrity and morals and fact, they just continue to expose themselves as the lying,
[22:32.040 --> 22:40.240]  corrupt, degenerate, mentally unstable individuals that they are.
[22:40.240 --> 22:50.320]  So now, yet again, the media and the Democrats are forced to defend Joe Biden who can't even
[22:50.320 --> 22:52.000]  ride a bike.
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.300]  Now, think about it.
[22:54.300 --> 22:59.440]  He goes on a vacation every weekend in Delaware.
[22:59.440 --> 23:01.840]  Every weekend he goes on a vacation in Delaware.
[23:01.840 --> 23:07.120]  He has taken more vacation time than any other president.
[23:07.120 --> 23:12.320]  So every weekend he goes.
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.160]  But they like to set up these little moments for Joe because he doesn't really have any
[23:18.160 --> 23:19.160]  moments.
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.400]  He hasn't done anything impactful.
[23:21.400 --> 23:23.560]  He hasn't done anything historic.
[23:23.560 --> 23:27.480]  He doesn't really make himself available to the media.
[23:27.480 --> 23:32.920]  So they have to set up these moments and they have the fake little staged White House area,
[23:32.920 --> 23:33.960]  but that doesn't really do anything.
[23:33.960 --> 23:36.180]  He doesn't really have any moments there either.
[23:36.180 --> 23:42.500]  So they have to set up these moments for Joe so they can have some sort of a media puff
[23:42.500 --> 23:48.360]  piece or some sort of public presence, but make it consumable so that it seems like a
[23:48.360 --> 23:53.760]  common man thing that the average American will see and resonate with, oh, he's riding
[23:53.760 --> 23:54.760]  a bike.
[23:54.760 --> 23:56.280]  Oh, he's eating ice cream.
[23:56.280 --> 23:57.280]  Yay.
[23:57.280 --> 24:00.360]  It's Joe's ice cream social again.
[24:00.360 --> 24:06.400]  Oh, remember when they tried to put him on the golf course and they staged that whole
[24:06.400 --> 24:11.160]  golf course shot and he almost took his own head off when he hit the wall straight into
[24:11.160 --> 24:12.360]  a rock?
[24:12.360 --> 24:17.960]  Yeah, there's Donald Trump having a little fun with Joe Biden unable to stand on a bike
[24:17.960 --> 24:22.560]  and falling over on truth social.
[24:22.560 --> 24:27.800]  But see, there's other angles to this like I'm going to be covering coming up.
[24:27.800 --> 24:30.160]  Yeah, let's see the media.
[24:30.160 --> 24:33.000]  Let's see the Democrats defend Joe Biden's health.
[24:33.000 --> 24:41.480]  Let's see them run this charade that Joe Biden is going to be running again in 2024 like
[24:41.480 --> 24:44.120]  that some sort of a realistic thing.
[24:44.120 --> 24:46.520]  The guy literally falls over on his bike.
[24:46.520 --> 24:54.240]  And just for a kicker, what does he do as soon as he's able to stand back up and regain
[24:54.240 --> 24:56.160]  his focus and consciousness?
[24:56.160 --> 24:58.280]  What is the first thing Joe Biden does?
[24:58.280 --> 25:02.720]  He finds a little girl to grab.
[25:02.720 --> 25:09.640]  No exaggeration folks stands right up sees a little girl and oh yummy and goes in for
[25:09.640 --> 25:11.440]  a little snack time.
[25:11.440 --> 25:13.360]  Yeah, get on down there.
[25:13.360 --> 25:20.440]  Wow, there he is, what do you expect from old creepy uncle Joe Joe president?
[25:20.440 --> 25:21.440]  Are you okay?
[25:21.440 --> 25:22.720]  Oh, oh, hi little girl.
[25:22.720 --> 25:23.720]  What's your name?
[25:23.720 --> 25:24.720]  How old are you?
[25:24.720 --> 25:25.720]  Want to go for a ride?
[25:25.720 --> 25:28.480]  Want to go down to the beach with me?
[25:28.480 --> 25:29.840]  Have you ever gotten sand in your underwear?
[25:29.840 --> 25:35.120]  I'm just President Joe Biden asking a little girl these questions.
[25:35.120 --> 25:39.040]  So pretty incredible stuff, but you can't even make this up.
[25:39.040 --> 25:44.440]  I mean, if you wanted to set Joe Biden up for embarrassment, this is exactly what you
[25:44.440 --> 25:46.120]  would do.
[25:46.120 --> 25:52.320]  You would have a media gaggle set up for him to ride up on a bike like they clearly staged
[25:52.320 --> 25:56.120]  means obviously staged there what the media is just there waiting for him to pull up on
[25:56.120 --> 25:59.240]  a bike like please, that's completely staged.
[25:59.240 --> 26:03.960]  But if you wanted to set Joe Biden up to embarrass him that that's the way to do it.
[26:03.960 --> 26:07.680]  Oh Joe, come right up on a bike, yeah.
[26:07.680 --> 26:12.840]  And then oops, up Joe falls over and then it was Hey, let's have a let's put a 10 year
[26:12.840 --> 26:14.160]  old girl right there too.
[26:14.160 --> 26:17.680]  So when he first gets up, you know what he's going to do so the world can see him do that
[26:17.680 --> 26:18.680]  too.
[26:18.680 --> 26:19.860]  Yeah.
[26:19.860 --> 26:22.680]  If you wanted to set Joe Biden up for failure, that would be how you do it.
[26:22.680 --> 26:28.120]  So it's almost like too good to be true like somebody wanted him to take this fall.
[26:28.120 --> 26:30.520]  But that's not even the story.
[26:30.520 --> 26:35.040]  The story is they now have to defend Joe Biden and they have to defend how he's destroyed
[26:35.040 --> 26:36.040]  this country.
[26:36.040 --> 26:41.200]  They have to defend the fact that they're putting pedophiles and perverts in libraries
[26:41.200 --> 26:47.480]  and school classrooms, giving them access to children, they have to defend this.
[26:47.480 --> 26:51.920]  They have to defend causing your gas prices to double and triple.
[26:51.920 --> 26:54.240]  They have to defend causing your grocery bill to double.
[26:54.240 --> 26:59.880]  They have to defend causing your energy bill to go up.
[26:59.880 --> 27:04.200]  And so that's the real story here.
[27:04.200 --> 27:09.840]  The only people that are telling you Joe Biden is still the real president or even fit to
[27:09.840 --> 27:14.800]  be president are just lying to themselves and lying to you and just living a life of
[27:14.800 --> 27:15.800]  lies.
[27:15.800 --> 27:18.440]  And that's why they're liberals and Democrats.
[27:18.440 --> 27:22.600]  That's the life they've chose.
[27:22.600 --> 27:25.280]  So okay, yeah, Joe Biden can't climb a flight of stairs.
[27:25.280 --> 27:26.480]  Joe Biden can't ride a bike.
[27:26.480 --> 27:28.360]  Joe Biden can't hit a golf ball.
[27:28.360 --> 27:34.080]  Joe Biden can't go to Europe without pooping on himself or needing to switch shoes to geriatric
[27:34.080 --> 27:35.080]  shoes.
[27:35.080 --> 27:39.240]  And Joe Biden can't be around any prepubescent girls or boys or he gets a little too excited
[27:39.240 --> 27:43.600]  and needs a little grab time.
[27:43.600 --> 27:49.400]  But the whole world is watching this, all of America is watching this.
[27:49.400 --> 27:52.520]  And when you compare and contrast, because more people have been paying attention to
[27:52.520 --> 28:01.560]  politics in America in the last eight to six years than really a long, long time.
[28:01.560 --> 28:06.120]  So people watched what was going on with Trump.
[28:06.120 --> 28:08.200]  They were paying attention.
[28:08.200 --> 28:12.720]  And it was even because most people had it so bad under Obama that they started to care
[28:12.720 --> 28:13.720]  again.
[28:13.720 --> 28:19.320]  But then there was Trump who was just like a break in the matrix.
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.720]  So then everybody started paying attention.
[28:23.720 --> 28:28.840]  And then there, of course, was Joe Biden and the Biden administration.
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.800]  So everybody can see what a disaster it is having Democrats in control and Joe Biden
[28:34.800 --> 28:35.800]  in the White House.
[28:35.800 --> 28:42.720]  But even more so, juxtaposed with what it was just like for four years under Trump.
[28:42.720 --> 28:48.080]  So is it a good thing that Joe Biden is such an embarrassment for this country on the planet?
[28:48.080 --> 28:49.080]  No.
[28:49.080 --> 28:51.160]  No, for this country, it's actually really bad.
[28:51.160 --> 28:55.440]  The embarrassment, the world leaving us behind now because our president is a joke.
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.160]  But America has another opportunity to wake up and realize it.
[28:59.160 --> 29:04.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalist hit humanity

[33:00.720 --> 33:06.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.960 --> 33:19.200]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:19.200 --> 33:29.120]  Welcome back to this special June 19, 2022 Sunday edition of the Alex Jones show,
[33:29.120 --> 33:34.400]  our Father's Day edition. Again, thank you for joining us. We're about to lay out
[33:35.200 --> 33:40.000]  some really chilling information that we knew was going to happen that we warned you 30 months ago
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.720]  was going to unfold because it's part of the globalist battle plan and they admit in their own
[33:44.720 --> 33:52.720]  light papers that this has been their operational objective the entire time. So here it is,
[33:52.720 --> 34:00.400]  another major signpost on the road to food rationing and food shortages and of course mass
[34:00.400 --> 34:05.520]  starvation and collapse in the third world. And remember the statistic that just came out last
[34:05.520 --> 34:13.440]  week that one quarter of Central America in the just the last decade has migrated or invaded
[34:13.440 --> 34:19.680]  into the United States and are being now organized by the Democrats, permanent underclass and to
[34:19.680 --> 34:25.120]  out vote the indigenous American population of all race, colors and creeds. This is the
[34:25.120 --> 34:30.160]  replacement migration plan of the UN. But that's a separate issue that ties into the
[34:30.160 --> 34:36.960]  destabilization operation. Here it is, Amazon launches its invite only based ordering program.
[34:36.960 --> 34:43.200]  Amazon is launching its invite based program for high demand items that are in low supply.
[34:43.200 --> 34:47.040]  But remember first there was no shortages but but now there are shortages. First there was no
[34:47.040 --> 34:52.880]  inflation but now there is inflation. We care about making sure bad actors don't impact the
[34:52.880 --> 34:58.160]  shopping experience in our stores for genuine customers. The company wrote in Twitter posts this
[34:58.160 --> 35:04.160]  week announcing the start of the program. So they're going to surveil what you buy and what you do
[35:04.160 --> 35:09.120]  and then decide as a social credit score whether you're allowed to buy stuff on Amazon and then
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.240]  it'll be invite only into their system and because they have dominance worldwide even above Walmart
[35:14.240 --> 35:18.800]  in a supply chain they shut down all their competition basically. They'll have the goods,
[35:18.800 --> 35:24.400]  they'll have the products and then they'll be able to gouge you because nobody else will have them
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.160]  while they spend the whole thing through the social credit score that they're actually making
[35:28.160 --> 35:33.840]  sure you don't hoard and you don't buy too much. So welcome to food rationing. Remember what the
[35:33.840 --> 35:39.040]  Davos group said 30 months ago. They said COVID will prepare you with the lockdowns for climate
[35:39.040 --> 35:45.040]  lockdowns and food rationing and government ministers in Europe. The UK and Australia said
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.520]  that was coming next and remember you're going to eat bugs, you're going to own nothing and you're
[35:49.520 --> 35:54.720]  going to like it. And people laughed and said I'll never do that. Well you will do that if that's
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.360]  all there is and so in Europe, the US, everywhere where the globe is in control, they're now having
[35:59.360 --> 36:05.360]  government sponsored and corporate sponsored programs to the school children, elementary students
[36:05.360 --> 36:12.160]  saying how fun it is to eat bugs and they're starting bug eating classes and bug eating
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.240]  events in schools to brainwash the children. So the children are being taught they're another
[36:16.240 --> 36:20.880]  gender, to get sterilized they're being taught to eat bugs. This is the dystopic system but look
[36:20.880 --> 36:26.640]  how Amazon spends this. Oh, to make sure you're not hoarding we invite you in and then you're
[36:26.640 --> 36:31.120]  allowed to get the items that all the smaller businesses and smaller groceries tour change and
[36:31.120 --> 36:35.680]  mom and pops can't get and then with all the carbon rationing and things that are coming up in the
[36:35.680 --> 36:40.880]  future you'll be non-essential, your business won't be able to operate but they will. Total vertical
[36:40.880 --> 36:47.760]  integration, total corporate fascist monopoly system. Amazon is launching its invite-based
[36:47.760 --> 36:52.800]  program for high demand items that are low in supply and it just goes on to say the site is
[36:52.800 --> 37:01.360]  already showing request invitation buttons on high demands like Sony's PlayStation S5 and it goes on
[37:01.360 --> 37:07.920]  from there so it's not just food but it's also a lot of other products as well and so there you go
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.920]  that's that's how these monopolies work that's what the public is is being prepared for and in
[37:13.920 --> 37:19.200]  fact not being prepared for we are now in the midst of this today and it's only going to get
[37:19.200 --> 37:24.160]  worse until we realize that during the lockdowns companies like Amazon and others doubled and
[37:24.160 --> 37:29.040]  even tripled their profits while small mom and pop businesses and even large regional businesses
[37:29.040 --> 37:35.200]  went out of business hundreds of food processing plants in Europe and the US have blown up or had
[37:35.200 --> 37:40.000]  planes crashed into them magically there's all sorts of other industrial espionage going on
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.240]  and if you look at how the CIA attacked Guatemala it was declassified back in the 60s where they
[37:46.240 --> 37:51.360]  even released crop eating insects and other things to make their economy implode you look at what's
[37:51.360 --> 37:57.840]  happening here you can see that this is the great reset this is the UN program of deindustrialization
[37:57.840 --> 38:02.240]  and starvation that is being launched against humanity now this is the most important point
[38:02.240 --> 38:05.840]  and I make it for the 10,000th time because if we don't understand this we're going to lose
[38:06.400 --> 38:11.360]  we understand this we're going to win this is all a coordinated globalist operation people
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.760]  ask me on the street I see all over the internet how does Alex Jones know the future how does he
[38:15.760 --> 38:19.360]  predicting everything and how does it come true basically exactly as he said it would because
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.000]  I'm not predicting it it's a globalist battle plan so last week the Environmental Protection
[38:26.000 --> 38:33.600]  Agency came out and admitted what has been known since the 1950s in this country and that is they
[38:33.600 --> 38:41.840]  are adding chemicals via fluoride not just hydrofluoric acid but other chemicals heavy metals and
[38:41.840 --> 38:47.360]  serious toxins in with the fluoride and simply calling it a fluoride product then there's all
[38:47.360 --> 38:54.880]  the other runoff from chemicals that the EPA and others do not ban and then other chemicals that
[38:54.880 --> 38:59.840]  aren't bad for us but are good for our industrial society and food production and our way of life
[38:59.840 --> 39:06.240]  they do restrict so here is the Washington Post the EPA warned that a group of human
[39:06.240 --> 39:11.040]  made chemicals found in drinking water cosmetics and food packaging used by millions of Americans
[39:11.040 --> 39:17.120]  posed a great danger to human health and regulators previously thought oh now the plastic liners are
[39:17.120 --> 39:22.320]  low in fertility now they're killing the sperm count now they're causing mutations now they're
[39:22.320 --> 39:28.480]  causing cancer it's not just the frogs that are becoming sterile it's the shrimp and the fish
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.320]  and anything else that comes into contact with this and yes us but then all the late night comics
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.200]  make fun of me and the left does and jones is crazy he says there's chemicals in the water that
[39:39.200 --> 39:45.120]  are bad for you because they don't want you to know that but now it's being forced out on the open
[39:45.120 --> 39:50.000]  so truly yet again tomorrow's news today they don't want you to know about this stuff they
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.480]  want to continue to target you and now they're coming for six month olds and up at the controlled
[39:56.480 --> 40:02.320]  FDA where they've had to have five different rounds in the last two years of resignations
[40:02.320 --> 40:09.600]  on the Food and Drug Administration's board because the majority of the board was voting
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.240]  against giving children the mRNA shots because they warned it wasn't effective children don't get
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.680]  that sick from covid and that it had serious side effects so think about what they've done now now
[40:21.680 --> 40:29.280]  they're going after six months and older because then liability protection under federal law kicks
[40:29.280 --> 40:35.680]  in for the so-called vaccine makers so they're hitting us from every angle and we've got to
[40:35.680 --> 40:40.800]  warn parents we've got to warn people when you see them in grocery stores or church or at the
[40:40.800 --> 40:47.760]  soccer league or at the swim team or wherever you are you've got to break through that wall where
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.560]  you never talk about serious issues you talk about sports or netflix and you've got to bring this up
[40:52.560 --> 40:59.200]  and warn the parents so that they can have the moral courage to say no when the schools try to
[40:59.200 --> 41:04.080]  then make the shots mandatory because after they authorize the shots then they try to make a mandatory
[41:04.080 --> 41:07.760]  and that's happening all over the world and remember it's big pharma becoming your doctor with
[41:07.760 --> 41:12.640]  bill gates trying to force control over your body now i'm going to hand them a ton over to owens
[41:12.640 --> 41:18.640]  shorter to host the rest of this special sunday show i'll be back tomorrow co-hosting with owen

[47:53.680 --> 47:57.040]  on his campaign that they were going to do this and then they said this is going to be transitory
[47:57.920 --> 48:02.880]  and now your energy bill goes up your price at the pump triples and you say hey i don't
[48:02.880 --> 48:08.240]  like this this doesn't work for me and the very people that planned this and told you they were
[48:08.240 --> 48:15.520]  going to do it are saying hey we didn't do this poodin did this and then joe biden crashes his

[48:49.520 --> 48:56.480]  spotted with jill on father's day a story of her diary and showers with my dad make the rounds
[48:57.920 --> 49:03.360]  and in that diary she talks about how it was inappropriate the way her dad would shower
[49:03.360 --> 49:07.840]  with her and she wonders if this wasn't sexual abuse and you know what it might have led to
[49:09.840 --> 49:13.840]  and then the media says oh it's not real it's not real it's fake and then the fbi runs over
[49:13.840 --> 49:19.600]  to project veritas to confiscate it and tug of carlson is covering it and that's why they hate
[49:19.600 --> 49:26.240]  him so much because he has an audience of tens of millions and they don't like people knowing the
[49:26.240 --> 49:34.560]  truth about the biden's the biden's hunter biden probably a lot like his dad joe i would imagine
[49:34.560 --> 49:44.400]  addicted to drugs addicted to porn addicted to sex likes to do it all at the same time
[49:44.400 --> 49:50.320]  yeah the apple doesn't fall far from the tree tug of carlson torches joe biden over horrifying
[49:50.320 --> 49:56.960]  claims of showers with sex addict daughter i wonder how the biden's became like that
[49:56.960 --> 50:03.280]  oh you know like hunter biden sleeping with his sister-in-law and then when joe biden was asked
[50:03.280 --> 50:10.720]  about that he said oh i fully endorse it wow well what could make what could make that situation
[50:10.720 --> 50:17.840]  worse hunter biden sleeping with his sister-in-law what could possibly make that worse oh yeah his
[50:17.840 --> 50:26.800]  brother had cancer when he did it man what a guy oh the biden's adventures with the biden's
[50:26.800 --> 50:35.360]  are we having fun are we having fun apparently the white house staff is not having fun
[50:36.480 --> 50:43.760]  and i've been i've been covering this but uh it's now making the news at a national level
[50:43.760 --> 50:51.120]  the burnout is real burnout they say biden age reportedly tapped out as white house faces staff
[50:51.120 --> 50:57.840]  upheaval pre midterms uh folks that's a false narrative it's not about burnout it's not about
[50:57.840 --> 51:04.320]  them being tapped out okay the info wars crew here works harder than the biden administration
[51:04.320 --> 51:10.400]  i promise you so it's not about burnout or tap out uh they don't like working for biden they
[51:10.400 --> 51:15.520]  don't like working for harris they realize that they're worthless or their tokens or they're being
[51:15.520 --> 51:24.960]  mistreated so they quit and it's very telling i mean you get a job in the white house with the
[51:24.960 --> 51:29.600]  president or the vice president you think hey you you see that to the end that's a big resume
[51:29.600 --> 51:35.680]  builder experience builder connections to be made and these people are just quitting dropping like
[51:35.680 --> 51:44.640]  flies from burnout burnout jill biden takes a vacation every weekend and half the days is
[51:44.640 --> 51:55.360]  done working by noon burnout give me a break we're burnout from what he's done to the country but
[51:55.360 --> 52:00.160]  they say oh there's nothing happening here you this is the greatest economic recovery ever
[52:00.160 --> 52:04.320]  you're in the greatest economy in world history under joe biden everyone's looking around like
[52:04.320 --> 52:10.000]  where what where is that going on no biden crashed this economy like he crashed his bike
[52:10.000 --> 52:19.120]  like biden advisor blows off recession fears i love this one americans are not realizing how
[52:19.120 --> 52:27.600]  successful our policies are we don't realize it guys we don't realize how great joe biden is that's
[52:27.600 --> 52:34.960]  your fault you you haven't figured out how great it is paying three times for gas at the pump
[52:34.960 --> 52:43.360]  that's your problem man that's not biden's problem that's yours or gene spurling going on msnbc this
[52:43.360 --> 52:48.880]  weekend telling you you don't realize how great it is it's like oh i don't realize how great it is
[52:49.600 --> 52:57.040]  you know pretty much everyone i talk to now if if if we start talking about finances or
[52:57.040 --> 53:03.760]  economics or stuff everyone i talk to is saying the same thing financially they are in a
[53:03.760 --> 53:11.840]  a much worse place than they were two years ago and it's sinking fast you got a 401k
[53:12.800 --> 53:21.360]  goodbye you got retirement you got savings see ya you had some crypto that was doing pretty well
[53:21.360 --> 53:26.720]  it was it was going up maybe maybe you were making a little money forget about that that's dead
[53:26.720 --> 53:38.960]  and now people are dipping into their savings to pay for things that normally they could afford
[53:41.040 --> 53:50.400]  because of the slow death by a thousand cuts that the biden lighthouse is inflicting us with
[53:50.400 --> 53:54.640]  right now but then gene spurling the biden advisor goes on tv and says you just don't
[53:54.640 --> 54:00.080]  realize how good it is this is your fault you just don't even know how good it is you're like oh wow

[54:10.960 --> 54:16.880]  tuned into msnbc at the right time for gene spurling of the biden administration to tell me how great
[54:16.880 --> 54:25.120]  it is gee gene i just paid a hundred bucks to fill up my tank it was 40 bucks two years ago
[54:25.920 --> 54:30.880]  i thought that was a that was i thought that was a bad thing that's my bad i'm sorry biden
[54:31.760 --> 54:39.760]  that was fantastic that was the greatest thing ever oh man my electricity builds up like 25
[54:39.760 --> 54:48.560]  percent this year alone i was complaining i should have been thanking biden man oh you had
[54:48.560 --> 54:57.120]  a nice 401k you had some savings you had some crypto it's all gone yeah have you thanked
[54:57.120 --> 55:04.160]  joe biden for that yet i mean come on man see i would have been confused because i didn't want
[55:04.160 --> 55:10.240]  to live in the upside down reversal bizarro world that liberals live in where having more money is
[55:10.240 --> 55:17.520]  a good thing and having cheap energy is a good thing they think cheap energy is a bad thing
[55:17.520 --> 55:27.840]  they say low grocery bills low low gas prices that's bad you having a big 401k you building up some
[55:27.840 --> 55:36.160]  savings you maybe getting a little quick turnaround on some crypto that's bad stuff folks that's free

[55:41.840 --> 55:49.680]  on this country all the prosperity we've had joe biden is a blessing so when you're poor and you
[55:49.680 --> 55:54.320]  can't afford your mortgage anymore or your rent payment or your car payment or you're dipping
[55:54.320 --> 55:59.680]  into your savings just to pay pay bills now be sure to thank joe biden for that
[56:01.680 --> 56:08.640]  no gene spurling goes on msnbc says americans don't realize how successful our policies are
[56:08.640 --> 56:14.800]  yeah how boy why would we not realize that beats me how can i not realize how great
[56:14.800 --> 56:22.560]  biden's policies are how did i not realize that oh that's because they aren't that would be why
[56:22.560 --> 56:32.720]  why that's the one stocks in biggest weekly loss since 2020 yeah since the pandemic since the
[56:32.720 --> 56:39.040]  pandemic since the fake pandemic oh stocks are tanking too i mean that's what i'm saying i i'm
[56:39.040 --> 56:44.400]  just talking to people that uh aren't even really that politically charged i mean they're common
[56:44.400 --> 56:47.920]  sense people that understand what the democrats are doing in this country but i mean they're not
[56:47.920 --> 56:54.240]  really politically charged but uh yeah you leave you lose a large percent of your 401k you lose a
[56:54.240 --> 57:00.080]  large percent of your stock or your crypto or your portfolio you see your bills going up you realize
[57:00.080 --> 57:09.760]  that way of life you thought you had is is dwindling you don't think they're gonna know what's going on
[57:09.760 --> 57:16.320]  no matter how many times biden says this is putin's fault americans are starting to pull back on
[57:16.320 --> 57:22.160]  travel and restaurants msn and it's all about how people aren't going on vacations flying getting
[57:22.160 --> 57:27.680]  haircuts building pools adding extensions to their houses because they can't afford it it's a good
[57:27.680 --> 57:32.880]  thing you don't realize how good it is treasury secretary jenny yellen insists recession is
[57:32.880 --> 57:39.360]  not inevitable and inflation likely to come down wow uh so let me tell you this uh we're already
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.960]  in a recession actually so i guess she's right it's not inevitable you're already in it and

[58:31.360 --> 58:35.680]  more and it's not just those items it's hundreds of other high quality preparedness items and

[58:45.440 --> 58:49.520]  can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning you know it's going
[58:49.520 --> 58:54.320]  back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and mobile technology
[58:54.320 --> 58:57.920]  first came out which is we thought you know this is going to level the playing field everybody's
[58:57.920 --> 59:01.200]  going to have access to the same information everybody's going to be able to freely communicate
[59:01.200 --> 59:08.240]  that information that's our goal to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the
[59:08.240 --> 59:12.960]  information we all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we
[59:12.960 --> 59:18.880]  want whenever we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[59:18.880 --> 59:26.080]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[59:26.080 --> 59:31.040]  we're having because of the internet searches that we're doing because of the the the discussions
[59:31.040 --> 59:36.080]  the people we want to talk to about these things so that's our goal is to help people take back
[59:36.080 --> 59:40.080]  their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy and so that's really what we're trying
[59:40.080 --> 59:46.640]  to do and so I hope that everybody listening will check us out at boltowireless.com that's
[59:46.640 --> 1:00:06.800]  boltowireless.com if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:13.200]  America is already suffering a food shortage which can be felt by rising costs and emptying
[1:00:13.200 --> 1:00:20.400]  shelves at the grocery store but this is a cakewalk it's going to get much worse the writing as they
[1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:27.680]  say is on the wall any reasonable person can see that this is all being done deliberately
[1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:36.400]  over 10 000 cattle just died and we are told that it was due to 100 degree weather and in just the
[1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:45.120]  past 17 months nearly 100 deserters have mysteriously befallen the american food industry dozens of
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:52.560]  catastrophic fires burning down food processing plants in multiple cases caused by small aircraft
[1:00:52.560 --> 1:01:00.160]  crashing into them thousands of tons of meat destroyed over 2 million turkeys have been destroyed
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:07.040]  over 40 million chickens have been destroyed and with the rising cost of fuel farmers are unable
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:16.560]  to harvest their crops and it's only just beginning remember joe biden promised he would shut down
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:22.880]  oil and gas i have one final would he close down the urland would you close down the other way
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:28.560]  i have a transition from the oral ministry yes oh i will transition that is a big statement
[1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:34.720]  because i would stop why would you do that because the oil industry pollutes significantly
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:39.600]  i said here's the deal but that's a big statement well if you let me finish the statement because
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:45.680]  it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time over time that's the biggest statement okay
[1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:51.840]  because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry will you remember that
[1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:56.240]  texas will you remember that pennsylvania oklahoma vice president biden let me give you 10 seconds
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:00.720]  to respond and then i have to get to the final question vice president biden he takes everything
[1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  out of context but the point is look we have to move toward a net zero emissions um but kiddo
[1:02:09.440 --> 1:02:14.480]  i want you to just take a look okay you don't have to agree but i want to look at my eyes
[1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:21.760]  i guarantee you i guarantee you we're gonna end fossil fuel and i'm not gonna clock it
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:29.360]  and they are making good with their radical promise except there is no alternative energy
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:35.920]  plan the biden administration is doing everything they can to shut down all fossil fuel in this
[1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:43.040]  country and not only will that stop people from driving all public transportation all shipping
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:49.520]  and all industry will come to a halt millions will lose their jobs and hundreds of millions
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:56.160]  will starve to death whether you like it or not civilization is dependent upon oil and gas
[1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:04.320]  and our government is turning it all off we are also still suffering a baby formula shortage
[1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:10.720]  and what little we do have is being sent to the open southern border for the tens of thousands
[1:03:10.720 --> 1:03:19.760]  of hungry foreigners being brought in unchecked and flown to already struggling cities across america
[1:03:19.760 --> 1:03:26.320]  and after several countries suspended the moderna vaccine for adults due to safety concerns the
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:32.800]  united states fda just unanimously voted to inject your infant children with the deadly shot
[1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:40.480]  your government is trying to kill you and if anyone thinks this is hyperbole or fear mongering
[1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:46.880]  they are not paying attention or they are in shock the only solution we are being offered
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:52.720]  is to vote even though we have a rigged election system and two parties that work for the same
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:04:00.240]  corporate establishment starvation is coming fast and people can only survive a few weeks
[1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:08.640]  without food and so what exactly will we do if the so-called red wave this november fails to turn
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:24.560]  the tide reporting for info wars this is greg reese
[1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:34.400]  biological attack is imminent imminent it's going to happen it's not a question of
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:40.320]  of will it happen but when it happens a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd release
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:45.200]  to bring in a world government to counter a global problem and the un has said that a global
[1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:50.480]  pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government this is a biological warfare
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:05:03.200]  agent that had leaked out of the wuhan laboratory there is very little contemporary study in the
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:11.120]  world of the planet's ruling class not in communist china not in mexico not in the united states not
[1:05:11.120 --> 1:05:18.080]  anywhere is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large
[1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:24.160]  central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look
[1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:28.640]  into say the anglo-american establishment the founder of the builder bird group the trilateral
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:34.240]  commission the united nations the whole project of the ross shawls and the rock folks until 10 years
[1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:39.680]  ago the media said the control corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist well now the
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:45.520]  builder bird group is public and its former head shown the steering committee is claus schwaab
[1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:50.720]  and he has set up the gray resetting global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide
[1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:55.200]  we don't address the globalist head on about the fact that they are worldwide authoritarian
[1:05:55.200 --> 1:06:06.160]  corporate takeover we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily
[1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:21.360]  waging war on corruption you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host owin shroyer
[1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:36.400]  well what have democrats liberals and now they run the government so the fbi department of homeland
[1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:44.960]  security been telling you about warning you about as the biggest threat white nationalists yeah
[1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:52.240]  it's white nationalist and trump supporters you need to be on the lookout for but then what does
[1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:59.840]  reality tell us oh no it's actually the left that is violent and it is the democrat party historically
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:07.680]  that is known for domestic terrorism but because the republican party you know really i guess what
[1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:12.720]  it comes down to is the republican party has been riding the gravy train for so long that
[1:07:12.720 --> 1:07:17.440]  they just let the democrats engage in the domestic terrorism without calling them out but we have
[1:07:17.440 --> 1:07:24.480]  republicans or it's via the republican party that populists that aren't in it for money or power or
[1:07:24.480 --> 1:07:29.280]  fame but to actually save this country are starting to get into congress that's the marjorie taylor
[1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:35.360]  greens lauren boberts paul gossars ran pauls and others matt yates that actually understand
[1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.080]  what's going on but back to the issue at hand
[1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:48.960]  aside from the violence look at the hypocrisy here us capital police arrest
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:54.960]  steven colbert staffers at house office building charged with illegal entry oh
[1:07:57.120 --> 1:08:02.880]  oh now they're liberal democrats so they probably won't be punished at all but
[1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:09.680]  but and there's there's still a lot of details lacking in this story the media is probably
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:12.400]  going to try to cover it up the democrats are probably going to try to cover it up but
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:22.240]  what we're supposed to believe is that well we know that steven colbert's team of riders
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:33.120]  and staffers did not have press passes to get into the building or to cover the january 6th hearing
[1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:43.600]  now apparently they had been interviewing a member of the democrat party i guess this week
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:53.360]  i forget which member it was a lesser known member of the democrat party and the story
[1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:59.920]  you're supposed to believe is that they tricked that democrat staffer into letting them in the
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:08.160]  building and that they were claiming oh we're just here to interview the congressman and then the
[1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:16.160]  staffer lets them into the building now i don't believe that because they got called they were
[1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:23.600]  got they got called the police were called on them because they were walking around unescorted
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:31.040]  and the actual complaint the call was that they were disruptive now tell me if you're an if you're
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:36.080]  a staffer or an aide for congressmen are you going to let someone into the building and then
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:42.560]  just abandon them does that add up to you not to me but that's the official story and so then
[1:09:42.560 --> 1:09:47.440]  they're roaming around trying to get access to january 6th apparently being disruptive end up
[1:09:47.440 --> 1:10:01.120]  getting arrested now for me personally i'd say okay give them a citation maybe maybe you could
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.680]  arrest them i don't even think they probably deserve to be in cuffs quite frankly but okay
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:09.040]  you know escort them out of the building give them a citation maybe a fine community service
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:17.120]  in court whatever i think that's perfectly justified and that'd be justice to me but
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:22.160]  see if you're a republican or a conservative and you do that it's not so easy so will it be
[1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:28.960]  the easy way out for these steven colbert staffers my guess is they won't even have a charge or a
[1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:40.080]  fine or nothing and so it'll be yet another again yet again another example of the two tiered justice
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:48.560]  system the two tiered justice system democrats are above the law there's no white privilege in
[1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:54.880]  this country it's liberal democrat privilege but they're also the terrorists pro-abortion
[1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:59.520]  activist and blood soaked outfits folks literally it's this weird thing they do they cover themselves
[1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:04.720]  in blood i don't get it but that's what they do i guess it's all about shock and awe and then they
[1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:10.880]  carry around babies little baby dolls covered in blood too and this is supposed to be a pro-abortion
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:18.320]  event folks these people have lost their minds they're they're literally deranged monsters now
[1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:23.600]  and they go out there with like makeup smeared all over their face blood smeared all over their
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:30.880]  outfits and baby dolls covered in blood and this isn't a pro-abortion event i'm sorry how does smearing
[1:11:30.880 --> 1:11:36.560]  makeup on your face have anything to do with your rights how does putting blood all over your body
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:42.880]  and over a baby doll have anything to do with a right and how is that pro-abortion i mean you're
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:48.000]  showing the world you like killing babies i'm just not getting it but why should i try to understand
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  what these deranged lunatics are thinking they're psychotic but hey they just try to
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.560]  assassinate supreme court justices they just published their private addresses they publish
[1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:05.680]  the addresses of their children's schools democrats vote to not give them extra security because
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:13.040]  they're trying to kill them and then they send their wild deranged wacky-eyed nut job psychotic
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:20.320]  protesters out there with blood-drenched clothes and baby dolls and and smeared makeup all over
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:25.920]  their face and somehow this is supposed to convince me that i should be in support of abortion
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:33.600]  an interesting strategy us abortion ruling nears us supreme court erects barricades
[1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:40.640]  to the public now why would the supreme court have to erect barricades around their building
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:47.840]  why would that be are trump supporters coming to town are the proud boys organizing an event
[1:12:49.280 --> 1:12:56.880]  hmm oh no that's right it's democrat terror season forgot it's the liberal summer of rage
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:04.960]  fat guys do we have our drop ready i should have been on you guys with that it it is the
[1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:12.800]  liberal summer of rage though so they're raging and the supreme court has to build a barricade now
[1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:19.920]  to protect themselves from democrat terrorists but does the fbi investigate that does the fbi
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:27.840]  comment comment on that the liberal summer of rage oh never heard of it i don't know about a
[1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:32.640]  liberal summer of rage i'm just building uh walls around the supreme court for no reason at all
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:37.840]  oh i'm building walls around the supreme court because the christian catholics the pro-lifers
[1:13:37.840 --> 1:13:45.680]  are about to come out here yeah oh who believes that and they're out there posting their signs
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:52.480]  all over dc calling for a night of rage i mean i'd be a mastermind if i was planning all this
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:59.920]  like for a show stunt i mean i would deserve an award i started i deemed this the liberal summer
[1:13:59.920 --> 1:14:06.640]  of rage months ago and started running it as a talking point and and that little stinger you saw
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:12.960]  and and and now they're actually calling it their summer of rage their nights of rage i didn't even
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:18.640]  plan it this way i'm a i'd be a marketing genius i wish i had that much control no they're that
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:26.720]  predictable i know them better than they know themselves i understand the liberal psychology
[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:33.360]  so much it's excruciating it's excruciating to know what goes on in these psychotics heads
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:39.760]  and to know what they're going to do next liberal summer of rage and now here you go dc called
[1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:47.200]  action night of rage it's one of their banner night of rage you said you'd riot

[1:15:12.880 --> 1:15:17.600]  they're building walls in dc and and businesses are boarding up in dc because the christians are
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:21.840]  coming to town because the christian conservative trump supporters have come to town in the white
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:28.960]  nationalist oh no that's right it's the democrat terrorists again that's what it is
[1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:36.640]  that's the one the liberal summer of rage is upon us and they're allowed to do it they're
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:40.800]  allowed to put out manifestos where they say we're burning churches we're burning pregnancy
[1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.400]  centers they're allowed to put up flyers that say it's time for us to rage and riot but oh you
[1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:53.440]  stand on the steps of the capital the fbi and the dhs are coming for you and your family and spying
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:16:03.040]  on you and getting all your records wow the globalist are bombarding us with propaganda and with
[1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:08.800]  spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're
[1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.840]  doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we
[1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:20.400]  are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet
[1:16:20.400 --> 1:16:28.000]  saying that nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:34.480]  necessary if the situation was hopeless they need all their propaganda and all their lies and all
[1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:41.520]  their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:46.080]  they signed on the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that
[1:16:46.080 --> 1:16:50.160]  everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever because even if you don't believe in god
[1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.000]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is shape and we are opposing the one world

[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.760]  there was a i think a general in the uk that just made a statement two guys i think the daily mail
[1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:35.280]  has a story i don't have it on my desk basically he's telling his troops to prepare for world war
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:40.160]  three with putin we guys find that for me to bring it to me right now or just put it on the screen
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:45.760]  either way it's fine but here's some of the other headlines there the craziest thing about seizing
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:52.080]  russian super yachts is that the u.s has to pay for them biden's national security advisor says on
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:56.880]  hot mic well i don't know if that's the craziest thing i mean yeah we are paying for them uh
[1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:02.960]  that's that's our operation biden's illegitimate illegal war against russia in ukraine it's it's
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:07.040]  ongoing yeah thank you guys there it is on the screen though that's the headline i was talking
[1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:13.600]  about prepare to fight and beat russia in a third world war britain's top general warns new u k army
[1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:19.920]  commander tells troops to brace for european land war in tub thumping message as tyrant putin menace's
[1:25:19.920 --> 1:25:27.680]  ex-soviet states now i don't want to go too off into this i broke this down at length on the alex
[1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:35.200]  joneshow friday and i i explained where the geopolitical pieces are falling but i'll just
[1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:39.840]  say it like this folks do not fall for the mainstream media narrative do not fall from the lies of the
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:47.920]  democrat party they're gonna pretend the lies of ukraine were just just a little sprinkle on top of
[1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:53.360]  the big lie that's about to come the lies of ukraine were just kind of a little window dressing
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:58.880]  on the big lie that's about to come and they're gonna try to convince people in europe and america
[1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:03.200]  and canada because those are the only leaders that are going along with this and i guess maybe the
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:09.600]  only people that are dumb enough to vote for it or support it and they're gonna say oh we're gonna
[1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:17.120]  defeat putin it's gonna be easy putin's a bad man dictator tyrant he has no support and i don't
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:21.760]  know what a kinetic war might look like i just know that's what the story is gonna be that's what
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:25.920]  the narrative is going to be that's what the promotion is going to be and what they're not
[1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:34.160]  going to tell you is that actually most of the planet is with russia and putin that's the just
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:38.720]  of it i'm the gist of it i'm just going to leave it right there for now because i don't want to go
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:46.000]  into it uh so deeply i covered it on the friday show of the alex joneshow but so it's a hot mic
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  and the biden advisor admits that yeah basically biden's war against russia and us going and
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:57.520]  seizing all these russians property is illegal and we're paying for all of it well no what's
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:01.840]  crazier about it is not that we're paying for it i mean we pay for things much crazier than this

[1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:15.600]  let's keep fighting leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:15.600 --> 1:33:28.160]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with olyn shroyer
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:36.000]  how could this be info wars next year's news today world health organization chief believes
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:46.080]  covid did leak from a wuhan lab after a catastrophic accident oh all this accident yes in 2019
[1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:52.640]  despite publicly maintaining all hypotheses remain on the table so now even the world
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:59.360]  health organization and tedros are being forced to admit what we knew all along that covid came
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.120]  out of a lab and so you have to ask why did they intentionally cover it up why have they
[1:34:05.120 --> 1:34:12.720]  been lying to us about it all these years and then why come out and admit that that's the case now
[1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:19.440]  but calling it an accident oh how laughable is that that's like uh you know if you had an insurance
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:27.600]  company and let's say you had insurance policy with this company for 20 years and then on monday
[1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:34.640]  you called up your insurance agent and you said hi i want to up my policy to the highest most premium
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:46.400]  thing in case my property my estate uh burns to the ground by fire that uh i get fully reimbursed
[1:34:46.400 --> 1:34:51.440]  cash and said okay we'll switch that policy for you and then tuesday your entire estate burns
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:56.960]  to the ground do you think your argument of it was an accident is going to hold water or do you
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:02.240]  think the insurance company is going to have an investigation and find out that that was staged
[1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:06.880]  it's like oh it was an accident really then how'd you have the covid 19 vaccine contracts
[1:35:06.880 --> 1:35:14.160]  oh it was an accident really then how did you do uh world event 201 talking about the pandemic
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:19.360]  and calling it covid hmm it was just an accident but you seemed to know the accident was coming
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:27.600]  so i guess that doesn't make it an accident at all does it no no it doesn't an accident he says
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:32.320]  that's nice so they lied to you for two years and then they just lied to you a little bit more
[1:35:33.520 --> 1:35:37.360]  well we can't be fully honest so when are they going to be fully honest and tell you
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:42.240]  yep we made covid in a lab yep we released it intentionally yep we used it to conquer the world
[1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:48.000]  yep we used it for population control and the vaccine mandates when are they just going to
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:55.200]  be fully honest and just tell you all that like info wars said from day one slowly but surely
[1:35:55.200 --> 1:36:00.640]  they'll slowly admit everything we reported was right and now they're telling you after
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:04.960]  year of the night years of denial a report indicates that the head of the world health
[1:36:04.960 --> 1:36:13.360]  organization believes covid 19 came from a lab in wuhan china wow no kidding you figured it out
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:20.080]  now when are you going to tell us the vaccines are killing us confirmed visor visor covid vaccine
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:25.760]  reduces sperm count in men another adverse effect of the forced vaccine tyranny again it's all an
[1:36:25.760 --> 1:36:30.880]  accident but they had all the contracts signed right before the accident magically happened
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:36.240]  they just had it all ready to go ready to go and now they're giving this clot shot that's killed
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:43.280]  more than 35 000 people according to government data to children experts and republicans call out
[1:36:43.280 --> 1:36:49.600]  the cdc for approving the covid jab for america's youngest children citing a lack of efficacy data
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:58.080]  or maybe they should show the data maybe they should show the document releases that show
[1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:05.440]  the blood clots and the heart problems and the gion beret and everything else that comes with it
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:10.640]  that has skyrocketed since the vaccines came out i mean can you imagine let's see here uh the number
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:17.680]  one side effect of the covid 19 vaccine is myocarditis and the covid 19 vaccine was released
[1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:26.320]  in december of 19 and since january of 2020 we have seen a 10 000 increase 10 000 percent increase
[1:37:26.320 --> 1:37:33.120]  in myocarditis boy what could that be linked to who could possibly figure out this great mystery for
[1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:39.760]  us they want to give those to your kids and then every day you have the sudden adult death syndrome
[1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:46.000]  that's what they call it sudden adult death syndrome don't dare call it a vaccine death
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:57.520]  another tiktok star geopastion dies at 19 19 19 healthy young girl sudden adult death syndrome
[1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:06.560]  sudden adult death syndrome keeps happening this southern uh sudden adult death syndrome
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:12.640]  just keeps happening it's amazing isn't it just amazing stuff and you know it's nice that there's
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:22.320]  one hollywood person one big actor who's just taking on these lies head on and and putting
[1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:27.280]  his voice on it and his face on it and is not ashamed or embarrassed at all probably more
[1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:30.960]  so than anyone else honestly and i'm not saying there's not other good ones out there i think
[1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:38.320]  rob schneider and some others but russell brand is probably as far as a hollywood actor you know
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:45.200]  hollywood celebrities are concerned russell brand is probably number one in in putting his will
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:49.760]  against this new world order putting his will against the lies when it comes to covet and
[1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:56.160]  everything else so uh here's russell brand talking about the dangers of following the science in clip
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.760]  11 here's an interesting fact though if you believe that vaccines are the best thing in the world
[1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.360]  and that the necessary solution to the problem of the pandemic and i know there are people that
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:09.520]  believe that as well a significant number of people believe that then shouldn't they have
[1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:14.960]  been made readily available in poorer countries or does it only matter that richer countries have
[1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:19.680]  access to that medicine there's a problem there particularly when these ideas are couched in
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:25.440]  neoliberalist politics they're all about fairness and sharing and kindness and whenever there's any
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:30.080]  cynicism and doubt you're a conspiracy theorist you're a nutter you're against progress follow
[1:39:30.080 --> 1:39:34.560]  the science we've just heard the problem with following the science is that the science follows
[1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:41.520]  the money that's the issue science is a subset of commerce truly objective science as is being
[1:39:41.520 --> 1:39:46.000]  suggested here independent networks focused on scientific endeavour of course we want that
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:51.760]  you'd have to be an idiot to sort of deny the effectiveness of bloody geniuses in laboratories
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:56.240]  looking at cells and examining the behaviour of viruses and medicines although i would suggest
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:01.200]  there are some evidence that implies that that should be conducted with extreme caution especially
[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:05.520]  if you're near a wet market all sorts of stuff comes out of those things but science within
[1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:10.960]  extreme commercial and financial imperative we just accept as normal because none of us appreciate
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.120]  the water that we swim in this is our reality so we just oh it's just normal yeah big business
[1:40:15.120 --> 1:40:19.360]  shareholders we don't do the research if it's not cost effective we've grown up on that but it's a
[1:40:19.360 --> 1:40:24.880]  problem when you present it as medically effective socially responsible personally necessary there
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:28.880]  are many many questions that are left unanswered and not questions that are going to be asked by
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:34.880]  claus schwaub at the bloody davos wf puff piece factory that's primary intention it seems to me
[1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:38.960]  is to create a globalist technocracy limit your individual power your community collective and
[1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:47.040]  even national power russell brand on his show and podcast really a great follow i enjoy his content
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:53.840]  and he's a true classical liberal that is just against big centralized government against corporate
[1:40:53.840 --> 1:41:00.480]  greed and wealth and just doesn't like the planet being lied to i mean that's what a liberal used
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:06.880]  to sound like against war against big corporations against actual fascism i mean that's that's
[1:41:06.880 --> 1:41:12.240]  russell brand but now oh they call russell brand a right winger now simply because he doesn't want
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:18.000]  the world to be conquered by some guy in a star wars clown outfit who wants you to eat bugs named
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.040]  claus schwaub or some guy named bill gates who says he's gonna depopulate the planet with vaccines
[1:41:23.040 --> 1:41:28.960]  and then tells you how great his vaccines are it's like oh wow you can use what did you just say oh
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:32.800]  you must be a conservative you must be a trump supporter uh no that's just called common sense
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:42.000]  actually and so that's where we're at but the truth is outside of europe and outside of north
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:46.560]  america nobody's really falling for this crap folks that that seems to be the trend to me
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:52.960]  and really it looks like these other countries have been waiting for a for a new kind of
[1:41:54.240 --> 1:42:02.160]  access of power if you will to emerge to push back against the corrupt western regime that has been
[1:42:02.160 --> 1:42:08.480]  slowly morphing into the globalist corporate government and now it looks like russia is kind
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:15.600]  of taking that role and then china is following them and then saudi arabia is following them
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:20.160]  and then india is following them and then iran is following them and now all the dominos are falling
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:25.920]  they don't even necessarily have to have common goals or common politics or common governments
[1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:32.800]  they just have to have the common understanding that the western regime that's been in power
[1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:39.840]  and the force on this planet for decades has gone wacko has gone completely psychotic and is now
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:44.720]  trying to turn the planet into a corporate world government that they control let's not do that
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:52.160]  let's not do that and your media and your politicians are trying to act like none of
[1:42:52.160 --> 1:43:01.920]  it's going on because they're in on it ladies and gentlemen in the last 30 months we've witnessed the

[1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:24.400]  point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the farmers don't let the Mexican government
[1:44:24.400 --> 1:44:28.240]  take over so i actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years
[1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.160]  and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50
[1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:36.160]  percent more per pound and i just think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere
[1:44:36.160 --> 1:44:41.440]  it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm not gonna
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:48.960]  tell you a little story um we had like that i think you wouldn't believe it anyway so it's info
[1:44:48.960 --> 1:44:53.360]  war store dot com and that's how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us you don't want
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:45:07.840]  to see that's fine i want to say brain force is great i want to say turbo force is amazing it is
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:14.160]  but if you took it with fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil's better than that and
[1:45:14.160 --> 1:45:20.640]  that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.520]  the best out there krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm sorry you want
[1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:30.080]  something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my
[1:45:30.080 --> 1:45:34.480]  view i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five culottes of krill oil
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:42.400]  before i go to bed i'm seeing santa claus that night so your brain is made basically out of
[1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:49.440]  what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsessed because
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:54.240]  whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it info war store
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:02.640]  look at that everybody else is just like yellow or clear that's because it's been
[1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:08.960]  denatured it's been worked out we didn't do that you think i would metaphysically
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.520]  tell you something but this is the very best i can get i'd rather go to hell and do that
[1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:21.040]  i will only give you the maximum best info the maximum truth the maximum product because i want
[1:46:21.040 --> 1:46:26.720]  that good will what i do to you i do to myself don't you get the big secret you ever seen

[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:37.680]  liquid consciousness
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:48.560]  look it up find out how even the fda and the government admits fish oil is incredible
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:53.840]  the number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil
[1:46:53.840 --> 1:46:57.120]  just like our informations dynamite so are our products in four store dot com
[1:46:59.680 --> 1:47:05.680]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:23.920]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:33.040]  the puppet new world order minion joe biden sat in a wall
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:38.240]  the puppet of the new world order biden had a great fall and all the puppets horses and
[1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:44.400]  all the new world orders men not even claus schwaab could put him back together again
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:49.200]  radio's narrative for months has been that joe biden is falling apart you just heard
[1:47:49.200 --> 1:48:05.040]  bench pierce it falling apart and there he is riding a bike out for a bike ride
[1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:35.040]  hahaha
[1:48:49.200 --> 1:49:01.200]  President, how are you feeling?
[1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:04.200]  How are you feeling, sir?
[1:49:04.200 --> 1:49:05.200]  Good.
[1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:06.200]  There you go.
[1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:07.200]  How are you feeling?
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:13.560]  Finally, tonight, I want to say a few words about Joe Biden coming to a complete stop
[1:49:13.560 --> 1:49:16.800]  and then losing his balance and falling over.
[1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:20.520]  This isn't just emblematic of the design collapse in the United States or how he's been positioned
[1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:26.360]  to be the fall guy, quite literally and figuratively, in the scapegoat for this globalist program
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.800]  of deindustrialization and collapse.
[1:49:28.800 --> 1:49:30.920]  It's not just that.
[1:49:30.920 --> 1:49:35.840]  It's emblematic because when you watch the crowd cheering and hooraying whenever he knows
[1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:42.880]  how to drive a car or ride a bike, they are basically just fawning minions, most of the
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.320]  political operatives that are camp followers of his criminal regime, and then when he gets
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:53.680]  back up, they cheer, and when he does three little hops later in the day at a church to
[1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:58.720]  show how amazingly spry he is, they then cheer again.
[1:49:58.720 --> 1:50:01.120]  These people are pretending they're part of the power structure.
[1:50:01.120 --> 1:50:04.600]  They're pretending they're on the winning team, and they're pretending as long as they
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:09.360]  prop up this zombie-like creature that they somehow will be fulfilled.
[1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:13.560]  All they got to do is look at their 401ks, all they got to do is look at the stock market,
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:16.560]  all they got to do is look at the value of their dollar, all they got to do is look at
[1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:20.360]  the collapsed open border in a quarter of Central America now living in the U.S. All
[1:50:20.360 --> 1:50:24.000]  they've got to look at is the crime statistics, all they got to do is look in the mirror and
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.560]  know that they are chumps, they are suckers, they are fools, including the White House
[1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:33.720]  press secretaries, including Joe Biden, including everybody that works with evil and pretends
[1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:34.800]  they're on the winning team.
[1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:38.800]  That goes for Obama, it goes for the Rockefellers, it goes for the Rothschilds, it goes for
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:41.320]  Claus Schwab, it goes for all of them.
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:44.840]  They can pretend to be God, they can act like dictators all day, they can try to crush
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:49.080]  little people, and then propagandizes that they are savers, but at the end of the day
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:50:55.760]  they're parasites who ignore their own common sense, and the spirit that God gave them,
[1:50:55.760 --> 1:51:00.200]  and they've turned against what's good and decent, and they've bought into the big line,
[1:51:00.200 --> 1:51:06.760]  and so they, along with the rest of us, will be very, very badly hurt in that process.
[1:51:06.760 --> 1:51:11.440]  So that's really what this is emblematic of, and it's very, very sad that this is going
[1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:17.680]  on, but the behavior of the sycophantic crowds is really what is illustrative here, more
[1:51:17.680 --> 1:51:23.200]  than his falling down, it is their blind worship, and then going against their own instincts
[1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:27.400]  and their own common sense, and what they see happening right in front of their faces
[1:51:27.400 --> 1:51:31.240]  that is really, really scary, because yes, he's got dementia, yes he's addled, yes he's
[1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:35.200]  stumbling around and falling down, yes he doesn't know where he is at the time, yes
[1:51:35.200 --> 1:51:40.040]  he's a puppet, but isn't the joke really on the people that are fawning after this,
[1:51:40.040 --> 1:51:41.040]  and it'll bind anything.
[1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:45.040]  That's what the globalist system is, it's a murder of logic, it's a murder of the
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:51.600]  programming God gave us, it's a murder of our own life preservation instincts, and
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:55.280]  to go against that, that's everything they teach us, humans are obsolete, humans are
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:51:59.400]  dirty, humans are bad, we're entering the post-human era, that's what Harari and all
[1:51:59.400 --> 1:52:03.320]  of them talk about, and they want us to just buy into this idea that we should just roll
[1:52:03.320 --> 1:52:08.320]  over and be slaves to the globalist, or be part of the slave master class and feed on
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:12.600]  our fellow humans, we're at the end of the day, we end up destroying ourselves in the
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:13.600]  process.
[1:52:13.600 --> 1:52:16.960]  Alright, Sunday Night Live is coming up, two more hours of live radio and TV, I want to
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:19.840]  thank Alan Shore for doing an amazing job, I want to thank the Listerers and crew for
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:23.760]  all your work, without you it would be in a lot worse position, so God bless, and I hope
[1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:25.440]  you have a great Father's Day.
[1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:29.840]  And Alex Jones is back tomorrow, so you've been patiently waiting, and he will be back
[1:52:29.840 --> 1:52:37.160]  tomorrow as honored as I've been to fill in here, or try my best to do so, Alex will
[1:52:37.160 --> 1:52:42.360]  return tomorrow, and you know, he said something right there that was so key that brings me
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:50.400]  back to where my mind was at, and really where my heart is still at, my mind isn't quite
[1:52:50.400 --> 1:52:57.720]  there anymore, because you know, the mind thinks the heart just beats and feels, but
[1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:03.040]  now the real joke is on those that actually believe Joe Biden, the real joke is on those
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:06.600]  that actually believe the mainstream media, the real joke is on the people that put the
[1:53:06.600 --> 1:53:10.880]  Ukraine flags in their bio, the real joke is on the people that fall for all this propaganda,
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:17.880]  and see I realize that those people are on, they're on my team, I mean they would, they
[1:53:17.880 --> 1:53:20.720]  would believe, they would have you believe, they would argue that they're on team good
[1:53:20.720 --> 1:53:27.440]  versus evil, they would tell you they're on team freedom versus slavery, whether they're
[1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:34.800]  being honest about that, it's a whole other debate, but no, the real joke is on them,
[1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:38.520]  the real joke is on somebody that cheers for Joe Biden thinking he's doing such a great
[1:53:38.520 --> 1:53:42.880]  job, the real joke is on somebody that thinks it's Putin who's causing all the problems
[1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:47.760]  in this country, the real joke is on them, and I don't want the joke to be on them because
[1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:53.880]  those are my teammates, and the analogy that comes to my head, and this is why it's so
[1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:58.880]  frustrating, I like to win, doesn't everybody like to win?
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:02.880]  Yes, actually, it's been psychologically proven, most people like to win, but I don't think
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:10.160]  you need a psychological evaluation to know that, most people like to win, so it's like
[1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:15.880]  I just use sports analogies because that's the world I came from for politics, so I just
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:21.560]  use sports analogies to explain cultural, political developments.
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:29.640]  This is like if you're a defensive football player and the offense is about to run a screen,
[1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:34.760]  and you're the middle linebacker and the captain of the defense, and you tell your other linebackers
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:39.880]  and you tell the linemen in front of you, and you say, hey, a screen is coming, they're
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:46.280]  about to run a screen, and they all turn around and they say, they're not running a screen,
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:50.360]  look, they're lined up to pass, they're going to pass the ball, everybody knows they're
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:56.840]  going to pass the ball, and you say, don't pass rush, they're running a screen, do not
[1:54:56.840 --> 1:55:01.880]  pass rush, they're running a screen, oh yeah, right, and then okay, and then nobody listens
[1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:06.520]  to you, everyone pass rushes, they run a screen, and they get an easy touchdown, and you're
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:11.720]  just sitting there saying, I told you they were running the screen, I saw the screen
[1:55:11.720 --> 1:55:16.880]  coming, you pass rushed anyway, and now they scored a touchdown, the joke's on you, but
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:22.280]  see the jokes on all of us, sure, I could sit there and point at my defensive line and
[1:55:22.280 --> 1:55:28.040]  linebackers and say, ha, ha, look, you guys, you guys fell for the screen, ha, they scored
[1:55:28.040 --> 1:55:33.880]  a touchdown on you, but then I'd be an idiot, because they scored it on me too, that's what's
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:39.200]  so frustrating, you really think when they call the population on this planet, they're
[1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:44.360]  going to give you an olive branch, you, they look at you as the dumbest people on earth,
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:48.800]  you liberals, you believe that the world, you thought the world was already going to
[1:55:48.800 --> 1:55:53.120]  end, Barack Obama tells you the sea levels are going to raise 30 feet, he buys beachfront
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:57.840]  mansions, you guys are jokes to them, you really think they're going to invite you to
[1:55:57.840 --> 1:56:01.800]  their party, you really think they're going to invite you to whatever elitist events that
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:04.000]  they think they're going to have when they conquer the world, you really think they're
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:13.680]  going to invite them into their armored redouts or underground bunkers, no, no, and that's
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:14.680]  what's so weird.
[1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:19.360]  It's like they really, they really think they're fighting the 1%, but then they're the complete
[1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:28.040]  stooge is of the 1% of the very rich people they think are so bad and so evil, they're
[1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:33.960]  the ones that are there being their willing foot soldiers, and it's just like you realize
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:37.640]  you're going to get crushed in all this too.
[1:56:37.640 --> 1:56:43.400]  That's why they're on the same team as I am, because we're all, we're all set for destruction,
[1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:48.080]  we're all, we're all set to become slaves, we're all set, we've all been sentenced to
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:56.080]  death by the New World Order, so we're on the same team, and that's what's so frustrating
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:04.760]  because I don't want to see my team fall for the screen pass when we all know it's coming,
[1:57:04.760 --> 1:57:09.160]  and that's what's going on, but it's just, this is a perfect example, this is a perfect
[1:57:09.160 --> 1:57:14.040]  example of them falling for the pump fake screen pass, House Democrats propose 1,000%
[1:57:14.040 --> 1:57:19.040]  tax on AR-15s, and liberals love it, Democrats jumping up and down, oh so only rich people
[1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:24.800]  can have guns, like do you not even see what you're doing here, and it's all in response
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:27.840]  to the Uvaldi thing which turns out was a police stand down, I mean I don't know how
[1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:32.120]  to describe it, it's total police stand down, police went 77 minutes without trying to open
[1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:36.360]  the door where a shooter was inside killing children, and now the Uvaldi officials have
[1:57:36.360 --> 1:57:39.600]  hired a law firm to block the release of all these records because it's so embarrassing,
[1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:43.080]  but hey, take innocent people's guns because the police stood down during a mass shooting,
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:48.640]  okay, Christy Lee coming up with Sunday Night Live.
[1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:53.880]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this, trust
[1:57:53.880 --> 1:57:59.800]  in God, but tie up your camel, Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God but row away
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:04.200]  from the rocks, if your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get
[1:58:04.200 --> 1:58:07.960]  smashed on them and killed, but also try to row away, you can't just sit there like a
[1:58:07.960 --> 1:58:13.120]  jellyfish, and it's the same thing with our immune system, God helps those who help themselves.
