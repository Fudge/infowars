[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:16.435]  With the global collapse going on, with the new world order, with them telling you power outages and Russian cyber attacks are imminent and right-wingers are about to engage in terror, they're the number one threat, the military's needed against the American people, then they introduce the legislation to do it, that's a big deal!
[00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:22.437]  And our own people call me and say, oh, they've tried this for a long time.
[00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:23.478]  Yeah.
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.320]  And now they're doing it.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.461]  Look at where we are.
[00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:39.146]  There is a worldwide financial bubble that they've built to buy up the world, and now they're going to implode it, pose as saviors, bring in the Great Reset, bring in the universal social credit score, the universal basic income, the carbon tax.
[00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.826]  It's all been announced.
[00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.407]  It's all happening now.
[00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:54.236]  Well they'll never get forced inoculations except medical workers and military and most other countries and well if you want to fly in or out of the country and it's already happening.
[00:00:55.276 --> 00:01:00.038]  And they've got all these followers and people pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:08.221]  Pretending like they're not going to be completely and totally and absolutely screwed by this.
[00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:18.252]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:20.131]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:26.131]  [Music]
[00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:27.437]  The vaccine is on its way.
[00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:28.198]  Oh, really?
[00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:28.758]  That's right.
[00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.680]  It's a brand new mRNA vaccine, so... mRNA?
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.281]  That's never been done before, right?
[00:01:33.602 --> 00:01:34.742]  Oh, no, it's been done before.
[00:01:34.802 --> 00:01:40.386]  It just never made it out of the testing phase because all of the animals kept dying, but, uh, but it'll be different this time.
[00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:40.886]  How so?
[00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:45.369]  Well, we're not gonna do the animal testing, so... So you're just gonna go straight to testing on humans?
[00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.450]  Yeah, you could say that.
[00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.453]  I mean, even so, don't most vaccines take years to develop and decades to test?
[00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:50.773]  It's here!
[00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:51.533]  The vaccine is here!
[00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:52.354]  Uh, already?
[00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:54.735]  That's right, it's here and it's 100% effective.
[00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:58.557]  No transmission, no infection, and you don't have to wear a mask or stay locked down anymore.
[00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.458]  Wow, really?
[00:01:59.478 --> 00:02:01.859]  Yep, except for the things about the mask and lockdown, yep.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.100]  Okay, but it's 100% effective?
[00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:06.342]  That's right, 90% effective.
[00:02:06.362 --> 00:02:09.003]  And frankly, 85% effectiveness is really incredible.
[00:02:09.363 --> 00:02:11.264]  Oh, so it's only like 85% effective?
[00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:11.925]  Eh, not quite.
[00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:15.687]  It's more like 75%, but hey, 65% still very good.
[00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:19.209]  I mean, they said we'd never even get to 50% effectiveness, and we did!
[00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:20.169]  Almost.
[00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.369]  So, 40%?
[00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.531]  Really great achievement.
[00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:24.793]  So it's only like 40% effective now?
[00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:25.934]  For a bit.
[00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:26.815]  A bit?
[00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:28.516]  I mean, it wears off.
[00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:30.278]  Well, after how long?
[00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:31.499]  Like four to six.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.860]  Four to six what?
[00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:34.962]  Booster shots a year!
[00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:37.985]  Okay, so it really only works like right after you get the shot.
[00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:43.530]  Well, not right after, because we don't even consider you vaccinated until two weeks after your second shot, so.
[00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.851]  Okay, so it takes like a month?
[00:02:45.211 --> 00:03:00.825]  For the shots to work, but it wears off, and even then it only gives you mild protection, but you have to get boosters that also wear off, you still have to wear a mask, you can still get COVID, and you still have to stay home, and there are rare but serious side effects, and all of this over a virus that has a survival rate of over 99.5%?
[00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:05.109]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I never said anything about serious side effects.
[00:03:06.116 --> 00:03:06.697]  Are there, though?
[00:03:07.098 --> 00:03:08.540]  Certainly none I've ever discussed.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.824]  Yeah, but have there been reports of serious side effects?
[00:03:12.345 --> 00:03:13.346]  No, no, no.
[00:03:13.386 --> 00:03:15.569]  I mean, except for like AIDS or whatever.
[00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:16.370]  Did you say AIDS?
[00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:27.187]  Yeah, yeah, basically you like get AIDS and then there's this heart thing where your heart explodes and sometimes half your face falls asleep forever and almost everybody gets extreme nausea and pain at the site of the injection.
[00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:32.610]  Sometimes they just die right there at the injection site, but we're not sure that's caused by the vaccine, so we will not be looking into it.
[00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.093]  I cannot believe that pharmaceutical companies would actually release this to the American people.
[00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:38.034]  Oh, no, it's totally fine.
[00:03:38.054 --> 00:03:40.895]  They're completely indignified against any wrongdoing, so they'll be fine.
[00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:41.956]  Right.
[00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.273]  Look, a vaccine is literally the only plan I have, so it's happening.
[00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.075]  It's coming out and everybody's taking it.
[00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:53.762]  Even if it's risky, even if you have natural antibodies, even if it doesn't stop transmission, you are taking it.
[00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:55.484]  Wait, but you said it did stop transmission.
[00:03:55.785 --> 00:03:56.185]  Oh, did I?
[00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:56.626]  Oopsie!
[00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:58.969]  No, I don't think I'll be getting that shot now.
[00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.392]  Well, what if I offer you some tasty french fries?
[00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.271]  Okay, well, what if I throw in a single glazed donut?
[00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:07.132]  No.
[00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:08.733]  You drive a hard bargain.
[00:04:08.793 --> 00:04:10.754]  Well, what if I give you a chance to win $1,000,000?
[00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:17.179]  I mean, I feel like you're just trying to exploit my desperation at this point.
[00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.941]  I mean, look, this is about bodily autonomy.
[00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:21.022]  No, that doesn't exist.
[00:04:21.062 --> 00:04:21.642]  We checked.
[00:04:21.902 --> 00:04:22.423]  Checked with who?
[00:04:22.943 --> 00:04:24.364]  Well, the experts, obviously.
[00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:28.407]  Tell you what, what if I tempt you with not losing your job?
[00:04:28.587 --> 00:04:29.808]  Oh, so it's going to be mandatory?
[00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:31.809]  Oh, nobody's mandating anything.
[00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.695]  It's entirely up to you whether you take the shot or whether you lose your job and become a despised pariah unworthy of basic decency or life-saving organ transplants.
[00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:42.157]  Yeah, I feel like you're forcing me to get this shot.
[00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:43.578]  Nobody is forcing you.
[00:04:43.618 --> 00:04:44.399]  Just take the jab.
[00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.020]  I'm not going to take the vaccine.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.221]  Just take the jab.
[00:04:47.241 --> 00:04:48.422]  I feel like I'm being forced here.
[00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:49.703]  Take the jab.
[00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:50.584]  No, no, no.
[00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:51.004]  You know what?
[00:04:51.224 --> 00:04:51.985]  I don't deserve this.
[00:04:52.105 --> 00:04:53.466]  I have a right to my own body.
[00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:54.747]  Maybe I'll go protest.
[00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:55.467]  A protest?
[00:04:55.487 --> 00:04:55.888]  Yeah, that's...
[00:04:56.718 --> 00:04:57.058]  That's fun.
[00:04:57.078 --> 00:04:59.220]  Say, do you like having a bank account?
[00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:00.542]  What?
[00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.445]  I'm just asking, do you like having access to the money in your bank account?
[00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:05.786]  What are you saying?
[00:05:05.806 --> 00:05:09.570]  All I'm saying is there's no reason for you to be scared of Little Needle!
[00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:11.552]  Nothing to do with it.
[00:05:11.852 --> 00:05:13.453]  It's the only way to stop this pandemic.
[00:05:14.094 --> 00:05:15.495]  But you said it doesn't stop transmission.
[00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:16.536]  Exactly.
[00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:18.238]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:21.024]  God, some people are so stupid.
[00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:23.045]  You're not trusting the science hard enough.
[00:05:23.085 --> 00:05:26.726]  Look, it's not me telling you to take the jab, it's actually your sister Sarah.
[00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:27.486]  What?
[00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:32.007]  Yeah, your sister Sarah is requiring a vaccine to go to her wedding, so she works for me now.
[00:05:32.547 --> 00:05:35.408]  Oh God, I mean, that's like a once-in-a-lifetime event.
[00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:38.549]  Alright, I guess I'll get the vaccine.
[00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:46.549]  Wow, what a coincidence.
[00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:56.549]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:48.052 --> 00:05:55.052]  Where are the children?
[00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:59.692]  just went live a few minutes ago at Bandai Video.
[00:05:57.537 --> 00:05:59.077]  We'll have it posted on the live show feed.
[00:05:59.437 --> 00:06:00.198]  It's next level.
[00:06:00.338 --> 00:06:05.939]  Everything Harrison Smith says in it is actually stuff they've put out as official policy worldwide via the U.N.
[00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.399]  taking over your body with Klaus Schwab.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.820]  The vaccine pitch meeting, it's at bandotvideoandinfowars.com.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.361]  We'll be right back.
[00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:18.622]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday, July 18th worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:23.484]  And I must be completely honest with all of you, I am completely exhausted right now.
[00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:34.190]  Because I actually read the bill yesterday before the show that they've introduced to the National Defense Authorization Act spending package, the defense bill.
[00:06:35.491 --> 00:06:47.958]  And then I did a lot of research that I'd already done years ago, but went and checked it and talked to some legal experts I know, including constitutional lawyers, and also Pete Santilli, that's one of the best researchers out there on this.
[00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:49.819]  And it was worse than I thought.
[00:06:51.089 --> 00:07:03.892]  And there's really not any words to describe how horrible this is, but the bell is really tolling for us all, the end of the republic and total tyranny worldwide is here.
[00:07:05.992 --> 00:07:08.453]  It is stunning to look at the U.S.
[00:07:08.513 --> 00:07:11.353]  code that they list in the legislation.
[00:07:11.373 --> 00:07:14.834]  The legislation says that it turns the president into a dictator.
[00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:20.365]  That for any domestic military operations that Congress gives up its oversight to the military.
[00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:24.087]  Just that alone is double whammy of classic tyranny.
[00:07:24.387 --> 00:07:29.848]  The military acting in and of itself and the president having dictatorial power outside of Congress.
[00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:34.510]  And then the rest of it just gets more insane from there.
[00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:40.472]  It says in the first five pages that they're preparing to go after domestic extremists.
[00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:59.486]  Not just the military, but outside the military, and that outside advisory experts, the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, Democratic Party, will direct the military on where they go and what they do, and that no civilian courts or Congress have any oversight of that, including rape in the military.
[00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:06.507]  I mean, this thing is just a cornucopia of stunning developments.
[00:08:07.688 --> 00:08:25.847]   And so I spent Four hours last night after my wife and my daughter went to sleep, reading this till my eyes were bloodshot, and I've got a massive folder of information that I forgot to send to the crew right before the show, so they're printing it off right now.
[00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:27.008]  I'll have it next segment.
[00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.832]  I was sitting there five minutes before the show, and I'm like, where's that folder?
[00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:34.535]  Oh, I forgot to send all the links to them, but I've got a bunch of it right here as well.
[00:08:36.047 --> 00:08:49.418]   So, to say this is the biggest thing we've ever reported is an understatement, and so many even conservatives and patriots and populists and Christians Are saying, well, they've been trying to use the military for a long time.
[00:08:49.438 --> 00:08:51.921]  And yeah, we've known about this stuff going back for a long time.
[00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:54.904]  The difference is, is that they're moving to go operational.
[00:08:55.925 --> 00:09:06.076]  And you see the whole climate we're in, and they're telling you the biggest threat is domestic groups, and they already stole a major election in front of everybody, and we're in the middle of a global financial meltdown and war with Russia.
[00:09:06.496 --> 00:09:07.417]  This is happening.
[00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:24.984]  They're intending to now implement everything that's been beta tested and set up before, and the martial law, the lockdowns, the forced inoculation, all the stuff we've seen the last 31 months was just the training wheels or the window dressing or the dress rehearsal for what we're going into right now.
[00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:35.785]   I mean, there is no doubt they're already trying this, there's no doubt they've already done a lot of this, and even we have senators And House members in Congress now saying this.
[00:09:35.885 --> 00:09:37.266]  So it's not Alex Jones's opinion.
[00:09:37.887 --> 00:09:41.770]  This is beyond stunning.
[00:09:44.032 --> 00:09:46.594]  Beyond stunning.
[00:09:48.476 --> 00:10:09.671]   What we're about to be laying out here today and then it ties into everything else What's going on with the shutdown of the borders or the opening of the borders, the collapse of the borders, the shutdown of the energy, the attack on our children, the Fed saying they're going to go after people at PTA meetings that say they don't like critical race theory, the purge of the military.
[00:10:11.513 --> 00:10:15.036]  All of this, ladies and gentlemen, comes together.
[00:10:16.004 --> 00:10:20.147]  With what's currently happening with the midterm elections out, 113 days.
[00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:22.308]  We're already under a dictatorship.
[00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:24.630]  We're already under martial law.
[00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:31.935]  We're already on the stove with the heat turned on, frying in the pan, but the heat is climbing very, very fast, and now they're putting the lid on.
[00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:34.137]  So, it's on.
[00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:35.838]  Big time.
[00:10:37.492 --> 00:10:41.158]  And I'm going to spend my whole three hours today going over all of this.
[00:10:41.859 --> 00:10:50.611]  Pete Santilli is going to be joining us in the third hour today, and you'll be assured that all the rest of our hosts and researchers are on this like white on rice.
[00:10:52.045 --> 00:11:06.871]  But this is the big one and massive exposure of this and major gubernatorial statements and major legislature statements and major think tank and lobbying groups are starting to come out as well.
[00:11:06.891 --> 00:11:15.914]  And the public getting in an uproar, a peaceful uproar about this can kill this dead in its tracks politically.
[00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:24.207]  And most importantly, blow up in their face and really reverse a lot of what is happening.
[00:11:26.188 --> 00:11:35.072]  But again, six days ago, Adam Schiff introduces an amendment that is sponsored by the party into the NDAA that they have the votes to pass.
[00:11:35.812 --> 00:11:42.074]  And they pass it usually months before the fiscal year ends in October.
[00:11:42.194 --> 00:11:46.476]  So that means they'll try to pass the NDAA here in just the next couple months.
[00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:50.381]  for the next year of military funding.
[00:11:51.282 --> 00:11:57.247]  You always hear about pork barrel being added to some of the bigger spending bills, and this is one of the biggest, if not the biggest.
[00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:10.218]  But this isn't your regular pork barrel, like money to this district, that district, or 15 million dollars to study shrimp on treadmills, that's a real thing, there's video of it, there's articles about it.
[00:12:11.178 --> 00:12:18.615]   That stuff's ridiculous, but You know, $50 million to study how to make rhesus monkeys trans.
[00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:23.137]  I mean, that stuff's dangerous and bankrupts you, but it's harmless.
[00:12:25.298 --> 00:12:26.899]  It's harmless compared to this.
[00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:29.140]  This is just inserted in there.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.662]  Like, you know, you come home, sit down for dinner with your wife and children, and you say, oh, by the way, honey, I killed the neighbor with a pickaxe a couple hours ago.
[00:12:36.282 --> 00:12:37.163]  Mind passing the salt?
[00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.542]  Or, hey, honey, I've got 12 women buried in the basement.
[00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:43.703]  I thought I'd tell you about that.
[00:12:43.743 --> 00:12:45.723]  I've been killing people every year for a while.
[00:12:49.825 --> 00:13:02.169]  I mean, they just... Oh, by the way, this makes it where the office of the president is above the law, and the Pentagon does not have congressional oversight over any domestic operations, and not Congress, no court, anyone has any jurisdiction.
[00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:03.270]  They have total immunity to everything.
[00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.611]  Just like Pfizer, because of their poison shots, or Moderna.
[00:13:08.198 --> 00:13:15.442]  And I saw a lot of comments on InfoWars, a lot of comments on BandoVideo going, you know, Jones, we don't want to hear this.
[00:13:16.322 --> 00:13:17.183]  Biden's a joke.
[00:13:17.223 --> 00:13:18.463]  He's about to be out of office.
[00:13:18.503 --> 00:13:19.464]  He's not gonna be a dictator.
[00:13:19.744 --> 00:13:20.044]  Really?
[00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:21.605]  He stole the election.
[00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:23.226]  He's a puppet.
[00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:27.788]  When I say the president, the legislation doesn't say just Joe Biden.
[00:13:27.928 --> 00:13:28.789]  It's a law.
[00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:34.152]  It says Gavin Newsom or Hillary Clinton or Nancy Pelosi.
[00:13:35.219 --> 00:13:36.481]  The word is it's Gavin Newsom.
[00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.444]  I haven't said that for years, but now it's the mainline news.
[00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.369]  It's a dictatorship of the deep state with a puppet president.
[00:13:44.049 --> 00:13:46.572]  And most dictatorships actually aren't run by a real strongman.
[00:13:47.213 --> 00:13:50.136]  They're actually run by a bureaucracy and a deep state.
[00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:53.801]  And that's what this is.
[00:13:55.782 --> 00:13:59.505]  That's what this is, and it isn't just for Biden.
[00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:04.149]  The bill doesn't say Biden's going to be given this power, because the comments are like, he'll be gone soon.
[00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:05.751]  I mean, I'm not scared of Biden.
[00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.132]  He falls off a bike.
[00:14:08.353 --> 00:14:15.279]  Biden's a placeholder, and the next president will be a placeholder of the deep state bureaucracy establishing a dictatorship.
[00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:19.062]  If Trump even tried something like this, I would 100% oppose him.
[00:14:21.004 --> 00:14:22.545]  If Reagan tried this, I'd be against it.
[00:14:22.965 --> 00:14:23.346]  Anybody.
[00:14:24.349 --> 00:14:32.594]  But this is the Democrats doing this, and it's cut, and it's dry, and they admit it, and they're saying it's no big deal.
[00:14:33.415 --> 00:14:38.859]  This is the most outrageous thing ever, and they've got the votes to pass it, to pass the NDAA right now.
[00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:47.384]  So, that's where we are right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:47.404 --> 00:14:52.207]  We're gonna go on a break.
[00:14:52.307 --> 00:14:52.928]  I've got the folder.
[00:14:53.928 --> 00:14:59.661]  And we're going to be going over all of this news and all of this information when we come back.
[00:14:59.841 --> 00:14:59.982]  Bye!
[00:15:00.928 --> 00:15:05.271]  If we're lackadaisical about this and just say, well, with all the other tyranny, you know, what's it really matter?
[00:15:05.651 --> 00:15:06.171]  You don't understand.
[00:15:06.211 --> 00:15:06.811]  They're locked.
[00:15:07.052 --> 00:15:07.612]  They're cocked.
[00:15:07.872 --> 00:15:08.633]  They're ready to go.
[00:15:09.033 --> 00:15:14.096]  And we need to create a huge stir over this and get Congress moving against it, which is already happening.
[00:15:14.656 --> 00:15:16.017]  They've really overplayed their hand.
[00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.097]  This is outrageous.
[00:15:17.398 --> 00:15:20.119]  Remember all the troops around the Capitol and the fence for five months?
[00:15:20.599 --> 00:15:22.380]  They're about to try that nationwide.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.383]  Remember the special office of the Congress with their federal police?
[00:15:27.461 --> 00:15:29.642]  Worldwide, governments are collapsing.
[00:15:29.722 --> 00:15:32.103]  Leaders are being assassinated and resigning.
[00:15:32.663 --> 00:15:36.864]  Food prices have exploded in more than half the world, over 50% of people's income.
[00:15:37.224 --> 00:15:41.286]  Every time that happens, it causes massive riots and accelerated collapse.
[00:15:41.926 --> 00:15:52.450]  We have IMF World Bank documents from 2001, where they were planning in the next 20 years to try this on major Western countries and use their control of finance to shut down the world economy.
[00:15:53.951 --> 00:15:55.191]  Emergency bombshell.
[00:15:55.231 --> 00:16:03.694]  Deep state Democrats caught red-handed inserting martial law and presidential dictatorship law into 2023 NDAA.
[00:16:04.874 --> 00:16:06.375]  Now, I want to lay this out again.
[00:16:07.495 --> 00:16:17.578]  In this pork barrel NDAA amendment, they've got stuff about sexual harassment in the military and they've got stuff about extremism in the military.
[00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:23.129]  And a lot of members of Congress since Friday are focused on that.
[00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:38.398]  But Senator Grassley and others, we played the clips on the Sunday show, are focused on General Milley telling the military in the last month of the Trump administration, don't follow his orders, even before January 6th, and that he was in command.
[00:16:40.039 --> 00:17:03.880]   And the Pentagon working with Democrats to kill Inspector Generals and others investigations of the military and FBI on the ground in DC that day in plainclothes, which we know is going on, because I have folks that work here that have been in special operations who recognized and talked to people they knew that were there for the US Army and others in plainclothes at the Capitol.
[00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:11.373]   So while I was trying to stop people going in the Capitol, and we got thousands not to, Thousands of U.S.
[00:17:11.413 --> 00:17:21.518]  military and FBI, including snipers, sat there under orders and stood down just like Yuvaldi and just like Parkland and just like so many other places.
[00:17:22.178 --> 00:17:23.479]  Incredible.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:32.883]  And Owen Schroer, trying to stop people going in, not going in, is facing years in prison and they're going ahead with his trial.
[00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:37.342]  That's how insane this is, and that's a microcosm.
[00:17:37.982 --> 00:17:46.064]  But the key is, it says no more oversight by Congress or the courts of military operations in the U.S.
[00:17:47.265 --> 00:17:54.627]  And the section states that clear-cut, then later it talks about other specifics, but it's a blanket check.
[00:17:55.507 --> 00:18:04.290]  But they put in the little subsections about finding extremists in the military and, you know, oh, only the Pentagon will prosecute rapes or whatever.
[00:18:06.115 --> 00:18:07.096]  As a diversion.
[00:18:07.216 --> 00:18:11.880]  It's still important, but as a diversion from what it really does.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.082]  And Pete Santilli's with us in the third hour.
[00:18:14.102 --> 00:18:16.324]  A legal eagle laying all this out.
[00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:19.307]  And it ties into all the previous martial law legislation.
[00:18:19.907 --> 00:18:28.533]   And when you look at the code numbers, it links back to that and activates military courts for martial law in America.
[00:18:28.533 --> 00:18:34.134]   That's what you saw in the aftermath of January 6th with the fence and the 30,000 troops
[00:18:34.134 --> 00:18:39.575]   and all the rest of it around the Capitol was a beta test and the announcement of
[00:18:39.575 --> 00:18:45.095]   the Capitol Police setting up offices across the country as their own Stasi investigative group.
[00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:50.855]   And it says that all those agencies, including the Congressional Agency and the CIA and another 16
[00:18:50.855 --> 00:18:55.654]  agencies will advise with civilian experts.
[00:18:55.879 --> 00:18:58.460]  From expert organizations, and it lists U.S.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:07.325]  code in the domestic extremism operation of the FBI and the advisors being the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League.
[00:19:07.865 --> 00:19:12.608]  So the Democrat Party, deep state globalist arms, the Commissars, in control of the military.
[00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:19.231]  It's like if you go to the Texas border and there's giant facilities that can hold 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, some of them people at a time.
[00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:23.974]   Some of these are the size of six, seven Bigger football fields.
[00:19:24.354 --> 00:19:27.657]  We've flown over them in a helicopter and just showed you these giant complexes.
[00:19:29.978 --> 00:19:31.359]  And the Border Patrol's not in command.
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:40.346]  There are NGOs, the same NGOs, the same director of an NGO in Europe that ran the collapse of the European borders and the 10 million Muslims they brought in.
[00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:45.730]  That head guy that works for the Soros Foundation is in command at the border.
[00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.292]  And we got video of all this and they admit it.
[00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:53.918]  So this is martial law being quietly rolled out, and here's the key.
[00:19:56.019 --> 00:20:00.221]  Congress is already investigating the usurpation of the President.
[00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:03.343]  When it was Trump's, he said, well, I thought the President was becoming a dictator.
[00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:05.183]  The President's a puppet.
[00:20:05.344 --> 00:20:12.127]  But Trump wasn't a puppet, so the actual power behind the throne, the military and the globalists, nixed Trump's command without him knowing it.
[00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:12.927]  That's now confirmed.
[00:20:13.067 --> 00:20:13.828]  That's mainstream news.
[00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:15.849]  Incredible bombshell by itself.
[00:20:18.482 --> 00:20:26.843]  So with Trump, they were usurping the power, but with a puppet, they want the puppet to have that power with no oversight by Congress or the states or the courts.
[00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:31.084]  I mean, this is unbelievably evil.
[00:20:32.044 --> 00:20:34.945]  And of course, Adam Schiff is the guy that introduced it.
[00:20:34.985 --> 00:20:35.945]  You're like, well, it won't pass.
[00:20:36.285 --> 00:20:37.825]  Really, it has the House leadership behind it.
[00:20:38.225 --> 00:20:39.686]  It's an amendment in the pork barrel.
[00:20:40.126 --> 00:20:44.366]  The National Defense Authorization Act, we're set to vote on in the next few months.
[00:20:44.426 --> 00:20:47.127]  And right now they have the votes in the House and the Senate.
[00:20:48.188 --> 00:20:56.296]  You notice with the last spending bill, the last emergency bill, they put the bill out that's 5,000, 10,000 pages long, depending on the bill.
[00:20:56.716 --> 00:20:57.497]  One was 4,000.
[00:20:57.977 --> 00:20:59.599]  And they get two hours before the vote.
[00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:04.163]  And they'll remove an amendment and then add an amendment back.
[00:21:05.004 --> 00:21:06.024]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:10.208]  We need people on this like flies on, you know what?
[00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:11.630]  Flies on Hillary.
[00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:12.791]  Flies on Obama.
[00:21:14.281 --> 00:21:18.281]  This is an amendment to H.R. 7900.
[00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:26.781]   We are going to continue, ladies and gentlemen, to track this as it unfolds throughout the broadcast today.
[00:21:26.787 --> 00:21:31.349]  I want to come back, though, and tie it into the new U.N.
[00:21:31.409 --> 00:21:32.970]  emergency that we told you was coming.
[00:21:33.351 --> 00:21:33.831]  Now the U.N.
[00:21:33.871 --> 00:21:42.516]  says they're set to declare a monkeypox global emergency, and we have all over the world the globalist operatives announcing new lockdowns and more.
[00:21:42.577 --> 00:21:43.177]  We've got that.
[00:21:43.697 --> 00:21:45.959]  We've got the ongoing shutdown of the economy.
[00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:51.293]   Biden and the Saudis telling him, hey, You've increased oil output already.
[00:21:51.833 --> 00:21:55.174]  You don't let the refineries operate at capacity, and you shut off the pipelines.
[00:21:55.974 --> 00:21:58.135]  And of course, I'm not from the Saudis' side, I'm not.
[00:21:58.155 --> 00:21:59.516]  That's a fact.
[00:21:59.636 --> 00:22:04.058]  I mean, it's not the gas stations, it's not the oil companies, they're not perfect.
[00:22:05.438 --> 00:22:17.143]  No, it's the policies of this great transition that we're in right now to bankrupt our economy in the Great Reset so they can build back better on the ashes of it.
[00:22:17.893 --> 00:22:19.814]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:22:19.854 --> 00:22:26.617]  We've got a really big, big, big transmission lined up for you.
[00:22:27.338 --> 00:22:35.962]  And I also intend to open the phones up next hour, and then Pete Santilli is going to be with us in the third hour to go through all the background U.S.
[00:22:36.022 --> 00:22:36.222]  code.
[00:22:36.242 --> 00:22:37.623]  I've got a huge red folder right here.
[00:22:39.223 --> 00:22:40.564]  All the background U.S.
[00:22:40.624 --> 00:22:41.004]  code.
[00:22:42.205 --> 00:22:44.586]  When it mentions a code, well, you've got to go read the code.
[00:22:46.002 --> 00:22:52.470]  And we're going to be going over the report on confronting extremist activity with the Department of Defense.
[00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:59.118]  And then once they get control of the military with that cult, then they expand that purge into the general public.
[00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:02.743]  Pentagon setting up domestic courts for the American people.
[00:23:04.645 --> 00:23:05.306]  And so much more.
[00:23:05.326 --> 00:23:07.087]  We're going to be looking at it all today.
[00:23:07.167 --> 00:23:10.310]  This is groundbreaking, end-of-the-republic stuff.
[00:23:10.771 --> 00:23:15.795]  But if we are aware of it and we speak out against it, the globalists can and will be defeated.
[00:23:16.336 --> 00:23:17.157]  We can do this together.
[00:23:17.177 --> 00:23:22.542]  Infowars.com, Tomorrow's News Today, Bandot Video, and so much more.
[00:23:22.562 --> 00:23:27.706]  We've got some really special reports that are extremely special that we put out coming up as well.
[00:23:27.526 --> 00:23:42.205]  Stay with us.
[00:23:42.847 --> 00:23:46.449]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:23:46.869 --> 00:23:48.449]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:50.590]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.831]  John has a long mustache.
[00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:54.772]  John has a long mustache.
[00:23:55.172 --> 00:23:57.913]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:23:57.832 --> 00:24:02.532]   And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:24:02.532 --> 00:24:07.832]  [music]
[00:24:07.832 --> 00:24:09.832]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:24:09.922 --> 00:24:11.843]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:24:12.063 --> 00:24:14.664]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:24:15.264 --> 00:24:15.544]  Where?
[00:24:16.645 --> 00:24:18.466]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:24:18.726 --> 00:24:26.689]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:24:26.969 --> 00:24:30.851]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:24:32.594 --> 00:24:37.596]  And we need the kind of camps that you all run.
[00:24:37.616 --> 00:24:38.016]  I mean, really.
[00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:41.057]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[00:24:41.558 --> 00:24:46.560]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.520]  I'm a sovereign citizen.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.461]  I refuse to recognize you guys.
[00:24:50.541 --> 00:24:52.382]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:24:52.422 --> 00:24:53.482]  would you see that happening?
[00:24:53.502 --> 00:24:57.524]  I mean, we've got a lot of Constitutionalists and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:24:58.084 --> 00:25:06.428]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:25:08.048 --> 00:25:13.931]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:18.850]   It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:27.850]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:31.850]   We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.850]  (music)
[00:25:33.004 --> 00:25:34.045]  Put your gun down, really?
[00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:40.608]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:25:41.188 --> 00:25:42.729]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:45.030]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:25:47.714 --> 00:25:52.744]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:25:53.245 --> 00:25:55.529]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:25:55.829 --> 00:26:00.230]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:16.230]  [Music]
[00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:21.028]  [Music]
[00:26:21.028 --> 00:26:26.028]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:26:26.028 --> 00:26:28.029]  Peace, Alice Jones.
[00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:32.029]  [Music]
[00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:34.029]  Alright, let me just do this right now.
[00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:37.373]  Let me just do this right now.
[00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:42.157]  Because if I don't do this we won't be on air very very soon.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.823]  That was an important promo we ran because it shows how we've been predicting what's coming and what's unfolding.
[00:26:48.483 --> 00:27:03.033]  We had to run that because a four-minute break wasn't enough time for me to deal with the finances and keeping the bandwidth paid for and the satellites and all of the bills that come into something when you have to build your own infrastructure.
[00:27:03.373 --> 00:27:04.614]  And I'm not bitching and complaining.
[00:27:04.894 --> 00:27:06.775]  This is your choice to make as viewers and listeners.
[00:27:07.796 --> 00:27:17.970]   If you want to keep us on air, That is your decision and it's up to you and I'm not mad at you if you don't make donations and if you don't buy product.
[00:27:19.391 --> 00:27:37.941]  Because a lot of this has been my fault for staying focused on news and information the last few years, while supply chain breakdowns happened and a bunch of other stuff went on, to where we didn't get product, most of the products in for over a year and a half, and when we had plenty of product, we made enough money to not spend half our time trying to raise money.
[00:27:38.752 --> 00:27:42.376]  Then I got a bunch of big donations a few months ago when we declared bankruptcy.
[00:27:44.478 --> 00:27:46.760]  And I thought that would put us way into the black.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.400]  It didn't.
[00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:55.789]  Because we were three to six months behind all these major bills and almost lost the whole operation.
[00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.833]  So now I've been up here seven days a week.
[00:28:00.731 --> 00:28:01.472]  I'm not complaining.
[00:28:01.572 --> 00:28:21.968]  I'm telling you, I was up here 10 hours yesterday, I was up here 10 hours on Saturday, I wanted to do a Saturday emergency show, had the guests lined up, had to cancel it, because I had to go into every aspect of this operation of where we can cut this or do that, and I put 95% of the money I have, and I don't care about money, I care about victory, but I am out of money.
[00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:28.426]  I can pay in the rest of the money I have in my private bank account, and it wouldn't run this place for two weeks.
[00:28:29.327 --> 00:28:30.287]  So we're out of gas.
[00:28:31.208 --> 00:28:31.909]  That's a fact.
[00:28:32.609 --> 00:28:37.454]  And I should probably just not even do the show right now and just go deal with this, because I got a great crew and great people.
[00:28:37.514 --> 00:28:40.456]  But man, it's like herding cats.
[00:28:42.058 --> 00:28:43.339]  It's absolutely like herding cats.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:53.950]   And I've literally got Accountants and people telling me listen if you spend every dime you've got You're not ever gonna even have money to even do anything.
[00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:58.191]  It doesn't matter Because I don't care we're going under martial law.
[00:28:58.291 --> 00:29:22.201]   All this is going down and it's very simple if listeners would simply go buy a bunch of products and if we got a hundred thousand dollars extra a week and With the three trials I have coming up and the supply chain breakdowns and all of it, enough products are going to come in in the next two months that we know everybody wants, that we'll be in the black and I won't have to sit here and do this!
[00:29:24.724 --> 00:29:31.886]  And you know, a big part of me has been doing this 28 years and wants it all to fall apart, but I'm not a quitter and I can't give up.
[00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:33.447]  Because I'm not going to give up with a gun to my head.
[00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:42.209]  I'm not going to give up with the threat of lawsuits or criminal investigations or them indicting two of our crew members and trying to indict me with open grand juries all over the news.
[00:29:42.489 --> 00:29:45.090]  That doesn't even threaten me, even though I care about my crew.
[00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:53.773]  But the jacking with money and sponsors and financing when I don't care about it drives me insane.
[00:29:54.753 --> 00:29:59.655]  So I want to first thank the listeners for your support over the years and tell you it's very, very simple.
[00:30:00.195 --> 00:30:07.118]  We've got the accounting and the business plan, because it's a business that funds this, that will have us secure in the middle of all this insanity.
[00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:21.700]  Well into next year, if people will simply now just go to InfoWarsTore.com at the top banner where it says Support InfoWars and make a one-time donation of $10, $50, $100, $20, $5, it doesn't matter.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:23.781]  Because then we get 95% of that money.
[00:30:24.402 --> 00:30:28.084]  With products, everybody wants some discount.
[00:30:28.124 --> 00:30:32.767]  We always sell them discounted, buy them, and so we sell them at a discount, but then enough money doesn't come in to pay the bills.
[00:30:32.867 --> 00:30:33.508]  I'm not bitching.
[00:30:34.949 --> 00:30:37.791]  I'm just telling you that we need your support.
[00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.611]  We need your support, right now.
[00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:49.255]  And you know, the good news is, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, the highest quality turmeric came in last week, and that really helped us start digging out of the hole.
[00:30:49.555 --> 00:30:52.957]  Because people know it's great products, but now for 8 months, 7 months, you really wanted it.
[00:30:54.062 --> 00:31:02.986]  And then, we had a product developed over the last few years that we finally got in that's the cleanest, and I mean the best, healthy fat burner system.
[00:31:03.026 --> 00:31:07.568]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in three weeks, in three months, with just the samples that came in three months ago.
[00:31:07.889 --> 00:31:11.230]  Now, Diet Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com is in.
[00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.532]  I don't have time to go over all the concentrated compounds that are in this.
[00:31:14.812 --> 00:31:15.592]  Go research it.
[00:31:15.872 --> 00:31:19.834]  This is a high-end, healthy diet pill that also makes you feel great.
[00:31:21.844 --> 00:31:25.247]  40% off, out of the gates, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:25.767 --> 00:31:29.130]  DietForce, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:31:30.591 --> 00:31:43.861]  We also have a lot of other great products at InfoWarStore.com that's almost sold out, like X2, like Ultra 12, the highest quality vitamin B12 out there, the highest grade, so amazing for your whole body.
[00:31:44.181 --> 00:31:46.543]  And what's going on in this world, you really need these products.
[00:31:47.264 --> 00:31:51.417]   And I can just tell you that I want to thank you for all your past support.
[00:31:51.457 --> 00:31:57.911]  I want to encourage you now to understand that I am working seven days a week to fight these bastards.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.403]  When I say I worked 10 hours a day on the weekend, folks, I was working when I got home at night.
[00:32:05.803 --> 00:32:08.865]  I worked probably 14 hours yesterday, and I'm proud of that.
[00:32:09.165 --> 00:32:10.186]  I wish I had more energy.
[00:32:10.386 --> 00:32:11.326]  I wish I could fight harder.
[00:32:11.626 --> 00:32:12.347]  I know I'm right.
[00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:13.487]  I know it's all going down.
[00:32:13.708 --> 00:32:18.070]  I know what we do is totally critical going into this period of human development and expansion.
[00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:29.537]  And I know we're going to make it through these people, and I'm going to give every ounce of my energy, but I know my time is better spent in the arena, politically, fighting the New World Order, and not literally.
[00:32:30.703 --> 00:32:39.099]  Literally spending five hours to six hours a day jacking with trying to fund this operation.
[00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:41.042]  It is torture!
[00:32:42.967 --> 00:33:07.309]  And I'm not complaining, I'm just simply saying, I'm at the end of my rope, and I'm not playing around here, ladies and gentlemen, that everybody just thinks we're here for 28 years, and we write the talking points of the resistance, and everybody knows we're the biggest black sheep, everybody knows we're the main rebels, everybody knows we're the tip of the spear, all I'm telling you is, I need to stay in this fight, you need to stay in the fight, I need you to go to infowarestore.com and donate, I need you to buy products right now, it's up to you!
[00:33:08.396 --> 00:33:09.857]  This isn't a radio show.
[00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:11.158]  It's not a TV show.
[00:33:11.598 --> 00:33:14.040]  It's an American resistance movement.
[00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:21.344]  And it's not just an American populist, pro-God, pro-family, pro-capitalism movement.
[00:33:22.205 --> 00:33:23.886]  It is the tip of the spear.
[00:33:24.906 --> 00:33:32.067]   Now most revolutionaries throughout history, including George Washington, robbed British gold shipments.
[00:33:32.067 --> 00:33:40.706]   And they engaged in all sorts of other brutal activity to win that war.
[00:33:40.706 --> 00:33:43.366]  And it's all endorsed today.
[00:33:43.366 --> 00:33:46.265]  And everybody thinks they were heroes, and I do too.
[00:33:46.265 --> 00:33:48.105]  We're not robbing gold shipments.
[00:33:48.105 --> 00:33:48.945]  We're not robbing banks.
[00:33:48.945 --> 00:33:50.706]  We're not taking hostages.
[00:33:50.706 --> 00:33:53.666]  We're selling products to fund this operation.
[00:33:53.666 --> 00:34:00.506]   And I cannot express to you, the viewers and listeners, enough how big a game changer we are.
[00:34:00.506 --> 00:34:05.226]  I mean, InfoWars is known now to be over the target.
[00:34:05.388 --> 00:34:13.335]  We have the greatest credibility with worldwide resistance movements from Eastern Europe to Brazil to the United States to Australia.
[00:34:13.475 --> 00:34:20.281]  And it's you, the listeners and viewers, that endorsed and commissioned and backed this operation to do this.
[00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:22.083]  And all the glory goes to God.
[00:34:24.218 --> 00:34:27.479]  And we're now living in the New World Order and it's takeover.
[00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:36.181]  We've stayed on air through all the attacks, they wanted us off air, and they've done everything they can, it would take days to tell you about, to do it.
[00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:40.902]  And I don't take that as a victim, I take it as them swinging for the fences because we're effective!
[00:34:43.063 --> 00:34:45.323]  But I also get very, very angry.
[00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.924]  Because I know what they've done to me.
[00:34:49.042 --> 00:34:56.944]  Because they want to get to you, and I look at my children, and I don't want them to live in a world like this, and I want to beat these tyrants, and we will beat them.
[00:34:57.944 --> 00:35:01.464]  The only question is, how bad is it going to get until we do?
[00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:06.465]   But I don't want us to get too comfortable with the fact that we all know about the New World
[00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:10.704]   Order and we all know it was coming and we just expect Tucker Carlson to always be there and we
[00:35:10.704 --> 00:35:15.265]   always expect Alex Jones to be there because when they cut the lights out, when they launch
[00:35:15.265 --> 00:35:18.704]   their nuclear war, when they pull their next move, that's not going to be happening.
[00:35:18.704 --> 00:35:30.864]   But we have a real chance if people wake up to what's happening and recognize in the sea of
[00:35:30.864 --> 00:35:34.625]   tyranny, the key movements they're making, where the daggers are, where the knives
[00:35:34.625 --> 00:35:37.305]  have been pulled out.
[00:35:35.826 --> 00:35:37.527]  We won't just defeat this New World Order.
[00:35:37.827 --> 00:35:39.348]  We will absolutely defeat it.
[00:35:39.648 --> 00:35:41.669]  It will backfire on them in every way.
[00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.471]  And they admit, I've got the head of the UN.
[00:35:47.276 --> 00:35:49.017]  Saying, we gotta stop this information.
[00:35:49.037 --> 00:35:49.757]  It's life and death.
[00:35:49.837 --> 00:35:51.878]  Our whole world liberal order is about to fall.
[00:35:51.918 --> 00:35:52.678]  We're losing.
[00:35:52.978 --> 00:36:02.562]  And it's because they are losing and they're pulling out all the stops to shut down the organizations and groups they know are kicking their ass.
[00:36:03.343 --> 00:36:11.466]  And if there was a standard at the head of this army in the enemy's eyes, they say it's Donald Trump and InfoWars.
[00:36:13.767 --> 00:36:18.745]   If there's something that sends them into a crazed Fury.
[00:36:19.445 --> 00:36:19.866]  It's us.
[00:36:20.466 --> 00:36:21.046]  And why is that?
[00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:21.966]  You've got to ask the questions.
[00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.447]  Donald Trump's not perfect.
[00:36:24.227 --> 00:36:27.328]  Neither am I. He's big time wrong on his poison shot.
[00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:31.710]  He even said last week at a rally, well, I'm not supposed to say the name of it, but I'm still proud of it.
[00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:34.330]  But at least he knows it's a shame what he did.
[00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.771]  He won't say the name of it anymore.
[00:36:36.351 --> 00:36:47.675]  But because of his populism and trying to be president and trying to secure the border and trying to secure the dollar and trying to secure the military and not wanting to persecute people for political speech and not wanting to censor, he's the enemy.
[00:36:49.858 --> 00:36:58.403]  But who writes the cultural talking points that Trump and now Rogan and all of them pick up?
[00:37:00.625 --> 00:37:01.165]  InfoWars.
[00:37:02.686 --> 00:37:08.730]  So I can sit here all day and cover news and information of how they're doing it and why they're doing it and where it's all going.
[00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:23.033]   But if we don't value InfoWars, If we don't value the reports we're putting out, I mean that's my own crew and myself, if we don't really realize that we really have the answers, we're going to lose this fight.
[00:37:25.854 --> 00:37:26.454]  At this juncture.
[00:37:28.555 --> 00:37:30.355]  It's going to get a lot worse before we win at the end.
[00:37:30.535 --> 00:37:32.256]  We're going to win in the end, you can see the trajectory.
[00:37:32.536 --> 00:37:38.936]   The question is how bad is it going to get before we turn the tide and deal with all of this?
[00:37:38.936 --> 00:37:53.496]   All over the world they want to make people totally poor under their control.
[00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.032]  I have stacks of articles on it.
[00:37:56.392 --> 00:37:58.513]  All over the world, they're cutting people's energy and food off.
[00:37:59.074 --> 00:38:00.294]  I have stacks of articles on it.
[00:38:01.795 --> 00:38:11.039]  And to me, it's just so frustrating that it should be so completely self-evident to everybody, not our great audience, not you beautiful people, and I mean that, you beautiful people.
[00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:13.500]  Every race, color, and creed, aren't you?
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.160]  I love you.
[00:38:15.081 --> 00:38:16.101]  You have the same spirit I do.
[00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:16.702]  I see you.
[00:38:16.742 --> 00:38:17.422]  I know you are.
[00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:18.622]  We are kindreds.
[00:38:18.642 --> 00:38:19.123]  We are brothers.
[00:38:18.943 --> 00:38:19.943]  We are sisters.
[00:38:19.943 --> 00:38:31.743]   But I look at the left getting off on collapsing things, getting off on wrecking the country,
[00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:35.383]   celebrating America falling apart as if they think they're going to take over the wreckage
[00:38:35.383 --> 00:38:38.703]   after they've wrecked it when they can't even wipe their own rear ends.
[00:38:39.527 --> 00:38:43.288]  When they can't even find their butts with both hands.
[00:38:44.988 --> 00:38:51.250]  To watch their satanic delusion is extremely frustrating.
[00:38:52.374 --> 00:38:58.454]   So I know we're going to win in the end and God is in charge of all this, but I got to be completely honest with
[00:38:58.454 --> 00:38:58.614]  you.
[00:38:58.614 --> 00:39:14.534]   The next phases of this new world order takeover are going to be so horrible
[00:39:14.534 --> 00:39:18.534]  because I have all the pieces you have all the pieces.
[00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.124]  I think you already know what I know.
[00:39:21.578 --> 00:39:42.286]  Many of you have a greater understanding than I do, that it's very hard for me, because I'm a truthful person, very hard for me to tell you the different scenarios and what's going to come next because when I say this, it's like going to the hospital and they say grandma's going to die and you're there when she dies.
[00:39:42.106 --> 00:39:52.106]   I mean you hate to say these things out loud. And so I'm not choking right now on air.
[00:39:52.106 --> 00:40:02.106]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:39:56.755 --> 00:40:02.018]  It's just... To preside over this, even cover this feels dirty.
[00:40:02.078 --> 00:40:04.399]  I mean, this is so horrible.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:11.683]  But if we don't tell you how horrible it is and show the proof, then you don't have a chance to stop it.
[00:40:13.864 --> 00:40:19.427]  So... I'm not doing this to be dramatic.
[00:40:20.916 --> 00:40:24.078]  Who knows this is 100% real, but I can't do the show right now.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:31.264]  So, let's come back with that Gregory's Report in the next little segment that he did that's so powerful.
[00:40:32.725 --> 00:40:34.666]  World War III and the imminent collapse of the U.S.
[00:40:34.686 --> 00:40:35.026]  dollar.
[00:40:35.547 --> 00:40:43.112]  Then we'll come out of break at 6 after, and we'll play the new Harrison Smith piece.
[00:40:43.533 --> 00:40:49.017]  You know, he put a piece out six months ago that got tens of millions of views, went super viral, got him banned on Twitter.
[00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:55.602]  Where he does this back and forth with himself and two different characters about what a fraud the vaccine is.
[00:40:56.343 --> 00:40:59.885]  Well, now the new one, the other one was platinum powerful.
[00:41:01.026 --> 00:41:11.832]  The new one, the vaccine pitch meeting, is so insane and so real because every word he says was official policy and official lies.
[00:41:12.693 --> 00:41:15.935]  That's coming up at six after, next hour, then I'll analyze it after.
[00:41:15.775 --> 00:41:27.775]   But realize everything he says, everything he does, is something they said and did, and it's true.
[00:41:28.422 --> 00:41:48.146]  And it's all the gaslighting put together there in one spot, and then I'll be back at about 14 after, and I'm going to control myself, and I'm going to start the show back over again, and I'm going to begin and just go through all of it in a mechanized, forward-facing way, and I will not actually take calls next hour, because all this has to be covered.
[00:41:48.466 --> 00:41:53.127]  And I'm going to go ahead and just turn it loose and separate myself from it.
[00:41:54.878 --> 00:41:55.899]  And just tell you the truth.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.161]  But I might have to go throw up first.
[00:42:02.643 --> 00:42:04.643]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:42:04.643 --> 00:42:06.643]  [laughs]
[00:42:06.643 --> 00:42:11.643]  Their plan is to kill 90% of us by 2030.
[00:42:12.049 --> 00:42:14.570]  You think all the collapse and all the setup you're seeing is bad yet?
[00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.653]  Folks, we're going to look back on this like it was a vacation.
[00:42:20.435 --> 00:42:25.465]  Man, I feel guilt that I can't convince you of how dangerous this is!
[00:42:25.866 --> 00:42:26.968]  How real this is!
[00:42:28.564 --> 00:42:34.249]  And I'm mad at not just people in my family, and the people around me, and the general public, and the crew, who I love.
[00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:35.511]  I'm more mad at myself.
[00:42:35.531 --> 00:42:38.213]  Because I get it, we shouldn't have to deal with this.
[00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:39.835]  It shouldn't be this hardcore.
[00:42:40.035 --> 00:42:48.142]  But it's up to us, and this generation, and now, and we're about to go through stuff that made World War II look like a cakewalk.
[00:42:48.783 --> 00:42:50.445]  Look like a Sunday drive.
[00:42:52.165 --> 00:42:53.086]  That's the truth!
[00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:57.069]  They're gonna kill you and kill your family!
[00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:01.908]   And I can't get the average person to realize, particularly those that serve the system,
[00:43:01.908 --> 00:43:05.749]   that if they don't get their heads out of their rear ends, it's over!
[00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:12.948]  Every show could be our last now.
[00:43:13.121 --> 00:43:13.981]  Every broadcast.
[00:43:14.242 --> 00:43:16.023]  We're up to the endgame now.
[00:43:20.947 --> 00:43:21.868]  I'm gonna come back next hour.
[00:43:21.888 --> 00:43:24.370]  I'm gonna control myself.
[00:43:25.892 --> 00:43:30.557]  But, man, it's do or die time now, folks.
[00:43:31.718 --> 00:43:35.557]   The churches, the politicians, everybody better wake up or roll over and die.
[00:43:35.557 --> 00:43:46.157]  Mark in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:48.198]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[00:43:48.374 --> 00:43:50.495]  First time caller, long time listener.
[00:43:50.655 --> 00:43:59.657]  I'm a self-employed 66 year old senior who last November moved from the suburbs of Detroit to lead the Nazi governor.
[00:43:59.777 --> 00:44:01.378]  Moved to the panhandle of Florida.
[00:44:01.698 --> 00:44:04.100]  At the time, my family and friends thought I'd lost my mind.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.282]  They no longer think that way, but at the time, they did.
[00:44:06.302 --> 00:44:07.663]  And I want to say, God bless you.
[00:44:07.683 --> 00:44:08.564]  Stay on the air.
[00:44:08.604 --> 00:44:09.764]  The devil is a liar.
[00:44:09.845 --> 00:44:11.406]  I'm going to plug one of your products.
[00:44:11.606 --> 00:44:19.572]  I listen all the time, and I heard this guy talking about the iodine supplement, X2, saying, well, he's been taking it, his memory's getting better, and he's having dreams, and I'm like, yeah, maybe.
[00:44:19.652 --> 00:44:22.234]  So I had to go back to Michigan for three weeks for business.
[00:44:22.395 --> 00:44:29.280]  I came back, and for a week, I had massive sinus headache, massive sinus condition, and a earache that was driving me nuts.
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.041]  I said, you know what?
[00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:35.725]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:44:35.686 --> 00:44:41.046]   couldn't believe it. The stuff is real. It works. So anyways, I want to thank you for all that.
[00:44:41.046 --> 00:44:53.446]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[00:44:53.446 --> 00:44:58.086]   going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:45:00.405 --> 00:45:06.725]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45:06.725 --> 00:45:30.725]  [Music]
[00:45:30.914 --> 00:45:37.020]  Fieri on Twitter wrote that everyone who touches Zelensky resigns, which is interesting.
[00:45:37.721 --> 00:45:50.193]  After failing the UK at every opportunity to serve globalist interests, Boris Johnson resigns as Prime Minister, to which the Russian Kremlin expressed good riddance.
[00:45:51.684 --> 00:46:03.570]  Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who helped deliver Italian weapons to Ukraine and rallied support for Ukraine's entry into the EU, announced his resignation.
[00:46:05.011 --> 00:46:18.418]  Last month, Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallis expelled the populist centre-left Centre Party, claiming that she needed to form a new government to support Ukraine in their war against Russia.
[00:46:19.398 --> 00:46:37.874]  And on Thursday, Kalas officially resigned as a formality to form a new government, which he has already reached a consensus between the center-right Reform Party, the Social Democrats, and the conservative Fatherland Party, to form a new three-party government to support Ukraine.
[00:46:39.275 --> 00:46:51.600]  And Sri Lanka's president, Godabaya Rajapaksa, who supported the Ukraine despite sanctions crippling his own nation, emailed in his resignation after fleeing the country.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:47:06.166]  Beyond resignations and beyond meet and greets with Ukraine's puppet president Zelensky, we have also just seen the assassination of popular anti-globalist leader Shinzo Abe.
[00:47:07.786 --> 00:47:14.731]  And the dramatic loss of confidence expressed by the people towards Macron, Trudeau, and Biden.
[00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:16.753]  What is happening here?
[00:47:17.914 --> 00:47:26.940]  On Celia Farber's The Truth Barrier, Katherine Austin Fitz explains that we are seeing a clean-out or political castration of leaders.
[00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:31.204]  Draghi, Johnson, Biden, Macron, Abe.
[00:47:31.784 --> 00:47:37.907]  Their political capital is exhausted and or they will not push the next wave aggressively.
[00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:44.069]  Mr. Global is looking to bring in a whole new round of fresh meaner leadership.
[00:47:44.949 --> 00:47:53.293]  The next wave is total collapse and it's not easy to find people willing to be the fall guy for the destruction of a nation.
[00:47:53.853 --> 00:48:07.022]   It takes a special type of person Which might explain why California Governor Gavin Newsom visited the White House right after Joe Biden was shuffled off to Israel to mumble about the Holocaust.
[00:48:08.323 --> 00:48:11.025]  Biden is even unsettling to the stupid.
[00:48:11.745 --> 00:48:15.108]  And this entire operation requires stupidity.
[00:48:15.828 --> 00:48:17.950]  So things are going to keep getting stranger.
[00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:24.835]  But it probably won't last much longer, because the global financial reset is now imminent.
[00:48:25.715 --> 00:48:33.241]  Sri Lanka was just the beginning, and it looks like South Africa could be next, followed by everyone.
[00:48:33.861 --> 00:48:39.425]  The fiat fractional reserve banking scheme has been robbing the people blind for decades.
[00:48:40.186 --> 00:48:42.427]  But eventually, all the money runs out.
[00:48:43.509 --> 00:48:47.114]  And the financial pundits are all saying it's this year.
[00:48:47.795 --> 00:48:50.519]  The dollar has just reached parity with the euro.
[00:48:51.421 --> 00:48:53.804]  And fudging the numbers will no longer work.
[00:48:54.546 --> 00:48:57.570]  They have only one solution left, and that's war.
[00:48:58.972 --> 00:49:03.037]  War has often been used to save failing fiat currencies.
[00:49:03.578 --> 00:49:12.908]  And having no other options, the psychotic bureaucrats in charge will go to war with Russia, which will only hasten the financial collapse of the West.
[00:49:13.749 --> 00:49:19.712]  If it comes to World War 3, then it will be the final death blow, making way for a new system.
[00:49:20.613 --> 00:49:25.656]  Which means that, unless you're holding on to real money, you will soon be broke.
[00:49:26.316 --> 00:49:32.480]  Because all that paper in our wallets, and numbers on our screens, is going to soon be worthless.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:42.759]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:42.876 --> 00:49:44.236]  The vaccine is on its way.
[00:49:44.616 --> 00:49:44.996]  Oh, really?
[00:49:45.156 --> 00:49:45.556]  That's right.
[00:49:45.576 --> 00:49:48.476]  It's a brand new mRNA vaccine, so... mRNA?
[00:49:48.516 --> 00:49:50.097]  That's never been done before, right?
[00:49:50.417 --> 00:49:51.537]  Oh, no, it's been done before.
[00:49:51.597 --> 00:49:55.438]  It just never made it out of the testing phase because all of the animals kept dying.
[00:49:55.518 --> 00:49:57.178]  But, uh, but it'll be different this time.
[00:49:57.318 --> 00:49:57.678]  How so?
[00:49:58.278 --> 00:50:02.159]  Well, we're not gonna do the animal testing, so... So you're just gonna go straight to testing on humans?
[00:50:02.619 --> 00:50:03.259]  Yeah, you could say that.
[00:50:03.499 --> 00:50:07.240]  I mean, even so, don't most vaccines take years to develop and decades to test?
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:07.580]  It's here!
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.320]  The vaccine is here!
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.160]  Uh, already?
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.541]  That's right, it's here and it's 100% effective.
[00:50:11.581 --> 00:50:15.363]  No transmission, no infection, you don't have to wear a mask or stay locked down anymore.
[00:50:15.723 --> 00:50:16.264]  Wow, really?
[00:50:16.284 --> 00:50:18.685]  Yep, except for the things about the mask and lockdown, yep.
[00:50:19.486 --> 00:50:20.906]  Okay, but it's 100% effective?
[00:50:21.527 --> 00:50:23.148]  That's right, 90% effective.
[00:50:23.168 --> 00:50:25.809]  And frankly, 85% effectiveness is really incredible.
[00:50:26.169 --> 00:50:27.190]  Oh, so it's only like 85% effective?
[00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:27.570]  Eh, not quite.
[00:50:27.590 --> 00:50:28.571]  It's more like 75%, but hey, 65% still very good.
[00:50:28.611 --> 00:50:30.612]  I mean, they said we'd never even get to 50% effectiveness, and we did!
[00:50:30.692 --> 00:50:30.872]  Almost.
[00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:32.552]  65% still very good.
[00:50:32.552 --> 00:50:36.992]   I mean, they said we'd never even get to 50% effectiveness, and we did, almost.
[00:50:36.992 --> 00:50:40.630]  So 40%, really great achievement.
[00:50:39.757 --> 00:50:41.598]  So it's only like 40% effective now?
[00:50:42.419 --> 00:50:42.739]  For a bit.
[00:50:43.339 --> 00:50:43.639]  A bit?
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:45.321]  I mean, it wears off.
[00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:47.082]  Well, after how long?
[00:50:47.642 --> 00:50:48.302]  Like four to six.
[00:50:48.983 --> 00:50:49.663]  Four to six what?
[00:50:50.444 --> 00:50:51.765]  Booster shots a year!
[00:50:52.405 --> 00:50:54.787]  Okay, so it really only works like right after you get the shot.
[00:50:55.647 --> 00:51:00.330]  Well, not right after, because we don't even consider you vaccinated until two weeks after your second shot, so.
[00:51:00.731 --> 00:51:17.910]   Okay, so it takes like a It takes a month for the shots to work, but it wears off, and even then it only gives you mild protection, but you have to get boosters that also wear off, you still have to wear a mask, you can still get COVID, and you still have to stay home, and there are rare but serious side effects, and all of this over a virus that has a survival rate of over 99.5%?
[00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:21.915]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, I never said anything about serious side effects.
[00:51:22.908 --> 00:51:23.509]  Are there, though?
[00:51:23.909 --> 00:51:25.351]  Certainly none I've ever discussed.
[00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:28.634]  Yeah, but have there been reports of serious side effects?
[00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:30.136]  No, no, no.
[00:51:30.176 --> 00:51:32.399]  I mean, except for like AIDS or whatever.
[00:51:32.419 --> 00:51:33.179]  You say AIDS?
[00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:43.998]  Yeah, yeah, basically you like get AIDS and then there's this heart thing where your heart explodes and sometimes half your face falls asleep forever and almost everybody gets extreme nausea and pain at the site of the injection.
[00:51:44.038 --> 00:51:49.423]  Sometimes they just die right there at the injection site, but we're not sure that's caused by the vaccine, so we will not be looking into it.
[00:51:49.763 --> 00:51:53.907]  I cannot believe that pharmaceutical companies would actually release this to the American people.
[00:51:54.007 --> 00:51:54.848]  Oh no, it's totally fine.
[00:51:54.868 --> 00:51:57.710]  They're completely indignified against any wrongdoing, so they'll be fine.
[00:51:58.150 --> 00:51:58.731]  Right.
[00:51:59.861 --> 00:52:03.085]  Look, a vaccine is literally the only plan I have, so it's happening.
[00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.887]  It's coming out and everybody's taking it.
[00:52:05.268 --> 00:52:10.574]  Even if it's risky, even if you have natural antibodies, even if it doesn't stop transmission, you are taking it.
[00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:12.296]  Wait, but you said it did stop transmission.
[00:52:12.597 --> 00:52:12.997]  Oh, did I?
[00:52:13.057 --> 00:52:13.418]  Oopsie!
[00:52:13.818 --> 00:52:15.761]  No, I don't think I'll be getting that shot now.
[00:52:15.801 --> 00:52:18.184]  Well, what if I offer you some tasty French fries?
[00:52:20.098 --> 00:52:23.060]  Okay, well, what if I throw in a single glazed donut?
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:23.960]  No.
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:25.541]  You drive a hard bargain.
[00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:29.423]  Well, what if I give you a chance to win one million dollars?
[00:52:30.183 --> 00:52:33.985]  I mean, I feel like you're just trying to exploit my desperation at this point.
[00:52:34.005 --> 00:52:36.726]  I mean, look, this is about bodily autonomy.
[00:52:36.986 --> 00:52:37.826]  No, that doesn't exist.
[00:52:37.866 --> 00:52:38.447]  We checked.
[00:52:38.707 --> 00:52:39.227]  Checked with who?
[00:52:39.747 --> 00:52:41.148]  Well, the experts, obviously.
[00:52:41.568 --> 00:52:45.210]  Tell you what, what if I tempt you with not losing your job?
[00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:46.610]  Oh, so it's going to be mandatory?
[00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:48.611]  Oh, nobody's mandating anything.
[00:52:48.671 --> 00:52:56.513]  It's entirely up to you whether you take the shot or whether you lose your job and become a despised pariah unworthy of basic decency or life-saving organ transplants.
[00:52:57.033 --> 00:52:58.933]  Yeah, I feel like you're forcing me to get this shot.
[00:52:58.953 --> 00:53:00.374]  Nobody is forcing you.
[00:53:00.414 --> 00:53:01.194]  Just take the jab.
[00:53:01.674 --> 00:53:02.834]  I'm not going to take the vaccine.
[00:53:02.934 --> 00:53:04.015]  Just take the jab.
[00:53:04.035 --> 00:53:05.215]  I feel like I'm being forced here.
[00:53:05.475 --> 00:53:06.495]  Take the jab.
[00:53:06.515 --> 00:53:07.416]  No, no, no.
[00:53:07.436 --> 00:53:07.816]  You know what?
[00:53:08.016 --> 00:53:08.776]  I don't deserve this.
[00:53:08.896 --> 00:53:10.256]  I have a right to my own body.
[00:53:10.616 --> 00:53:11.537]  Maybe I'll go protest.
[00:53:11.837 --> 00:53:12.257]  Oh, protest.
[00:53:12.297 --> 00:53:12.877]  Yeah, that's, uh...
[00:53:13.527 --> 00:53:13.867]  That's fun.
[00:53:13.887 --> 00:53:16.029]  Say, do you like having a bank account?
[00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.351]  What?
[00:53:17.711 --> 00:53:21.254]  I'm just asking, do you like having access to the money in your bank account?
[00:53:21.755 --> 00:53:22.595]  What are you saying?
[00:53:22.615 --> 00:53:26.379]  All I'm saying is there's no reason for you to be scared of Little Needle!
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.361]  Nothing to do with it.
[00:53:28.661 --> 00:53:30.242]  It's the only way to stop this pandemic.
[00:53:30.903 --> 00:53:32.304]  But you said it doesn't stop transmission.
[00:53:32.885 --> 00:53:33.345]  Exactly.
[00:53:34.146 --> 00:53:35.047]  That doesn't make any sense.
[00:53:36.533 --> 00:53:37.833]  God, some people are so stupid.
[00:53:38.173 --> 00:53:39.854]  You're not trusting the science hard enough.
[00:53:39.894 --> 00:53:42.194]  Look, it's not me telling you to take the jab.
[00:53:42.254 --> 00:53:43.534]  It's actually your sister Sarah.
[00:53:44.074 --> 00:53:44.294]  What?
[00:53:45.034 --> 00:53:47.595]  Yeah, your sister Sarah is requiring a vaccine to go to her wedding.
[00:53:47.795 --> 00:53:48.815]  So, she works for me now.
[00:53:49.335 --> 00:53:52.176]  Oh God, I mean, that's like a once-in-a-lifetime event.
[00:53:51.996 --> 00:54:02.595]   into. All right, I guess I'll get the vaccine. Wow, what a coincidence.
[00:54:02.595 --> 00:54:12.596]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:54:04.858 --> 00:54:12.458]  where are the children?
[00:54:12.411 --> 00:54:14.872]  It's posted on the live show feed on Infowars.com.
[00:54:14.892 --> 00:54:17.132]  It has its own post at Infowars.com.
[00:54:17.872 --> 00:54:18.833]  Next level powerful.
[00:54:18.853 --> 00:54:21.033]  This is one of the best informative videos out there.
[00:54:21.053 --> 00:54:23.894]  It just shows all the real statements they've made, all their gaslighting.
[00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:30.195]  And I think Harrison Smith playing the part of that globalist douchebag, he could be the new White House press secretary.
[00:54:30.855 --> 00:54:33.095]  I mean, the gaslighting, the in-your-face lying.
[00:54:34.096 --> 00:54:37.156]  Man, that satirical character makes me hate Harrison.
[00:54:37.556 --> 00:54:40.077]  I love Harrison, but he is a damn good actor.
[00:54:41.232 --> 00:54:43.754]  And he wrote that really well off of their real statements.
[00:54:43.794 --> 00:54:47.116]  That is pure veritas, an absolute gem.
[00:54:47.976 --> 00:54:50.278]  Band.video, Infowars.com.
[00:54:50.638 --> 00:54:51.539]  Folks, you need to get it.
[00:54:52.199 --> 00:54:55.721]  We get emails like, is it alright if I post that on my Twitter or I copy it to YouTube?
[00:54:56.082 --> 00:54:56.922]  No, it's not alright.
[00:54:56.982 --> 00:54:57.903]  We're begging you to.
[00:54:58.703 --> 00:54:59.944]  There's no copyright here.
[00:55:00.084 --> 00:55:01.025]  Everything's free to air.
[00:55:01.565 --> 00:55:04.567]  For our radio stations, TV stations, just carry the feed.
[00:55:04.687 --> 00:55:05.267]  Just get it out.
[00:55:05.408 --> 00:55:05.728]  Alright.
[00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:10.431]  I'm going to cover all the news right now.
[00:55:11.889 --> 00:55:14.290]  And I'm going to tie it all together, but you don't need me to tie this together.
[00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.370]  You can see what's going on here today.
[00:55:17.371 --> 00:55:24.753]  But in the National Defense Authorization Act, an amendment's been added by the Democrat Party, sponsored by Pelosi and Schiff.
[00:55:26.194 --> 00:55:32.996]  So they're trying to pass it.
[00:55:33.016 --> 00:55:36.677]  Democrats introduce bills all the time that people go, that's just one kooky member.
[00:55:36.717 --> 00:55:38.718]  No, this is the party doing this.
[00:55:41.055 --> 00:55:49.424]  And it says, oh, the president's a dictator in domestic operations and the military can do whatever it wants and has no oversight by Congress, which is in the Constitution.
[00:55:50.125 --> 00:55:51.246]  The end of Posse Comitatus.
[00:55:53.048 --> 00:55:55.250]  And again, the spin is, well, Biden's an idiot.
[00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.931]  He's not a dictator.
[00:55:56.211 --> 00:56:01.597]  Yeah, no, he just stole the election to get in and has opened the borders and imploding the dollar and starting wars.
[00:56:02.813 --> 00:56:03.774]  It's a pedophile.
[00:56:04.495 --> 00:56:05.417]  But he's a puppet.
[00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:08.201]  The bill transcends Biden.
[00:56:08.541 --> 00:56:14.109]  It's a law meaning the next president or the next president or the next president until it's repealed.
[00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:16.032]  Do you think they ever repealed dictatorship?
[00:56:16.653 --> 00:56:17.735]  Only by the collapse of it.
[00:56:18.993 --> 00:56:36.060]  So, with the global collapse going on, with the new world order, with them telling you power outages and Russian cyber attacks are imminent and right-wingers are about to engage in terror, they're the number one threat, the military's needed against the American people, then they introduce the legislation to do it, that's a big deal!
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:42.042]  And our own people call me and say, oh, they've tried this for a long time.
[00:56:42.843 --> 00:56:43.083]  Yeah.
[00:56:44.048 --> 00:56:44.928]  And now they're doing it.
[00:56:45.228 --> 00:56:46.069]  Look at where we are.
[00:56:46.109 --> 00:56:58.754]  There is a worldwide financial bubble that they've built to buy up the world, and now they're going to implode it, pose as saviors, bring in the Great Reset, bring in the universal social credit score, the universal basic income, the carbon tax.
[00:56:58.814 --> 00:57:00.434]  It's all been announced.
[00:57:00.514 --> 00:57:02.015]  It's all happening now.
[00:57:03.339 --> 00:57:13.842]  Well they'll never get forced inoculations except medical workers and military and most other countries and well if you want to fly in or out of the country and it's already happening.
[00:57:14.902 --> 00:57:19.664]  And they've got all these followers and people pretending like they're part of the power structure.
[00:57:22.064 --> 00:57:27.826]  Pretending like they're not going to be completely and totally and absolutely screwed by this.
[00:57:30.506 --> 00:57:32.027]  So Pete Santilli joins us the next hour.
[00:57:32.047 --> 00:57:36.451]  We're going to drill into that legislation and tie it into the larger globalist takeover plan.
[00:57:36.511 --> 00:57:37.492]  This is so critical.
[00:57:38.713 --> 00:57:46.259]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.343]  When we come back, I'm going to tie it in to the next leg of the new lockdowns.
[00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:56.167]  I'm going to tie it in to the economic shutdowns.
[00:57:57.728 --> 00:58:03.118]  And the UN calling for censorship of the American people and just so much more here today.
[00:58:03.158 --> 00:58:04.320]  But I'm going to say this again right now.
[00:58:05.855 --> 00:58:09.213]   I want to thank Liz's for your support. We've got incredible things. We've changed the world together.
[00:58:09.213 --> 00:58:14.894]   And you've done amazing things. And if you want to keep your investment going and keep this tip
[00:58:14.894 --> 00:58:17.114]  of the spear in the fight, we need your support right now.
[00:58:17.114 --> 00:58:18.815]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[00:58:18.815 --> 00:58:23.534]   Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula was sold out for seven, almost eight months. It's back in stock.
[00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:28.974]   Highest level of curcuminoid of any product out there. The leading brands have 30, 40 percent.
[00:58:29.142 --> 00:58:32.824]  The top brand that's the strongest after us is 75%.
[00:58:33.765 --> 00:58:36.587]  We pay to have the strongest concentrated turmeric out there.
[00:58:36.607 --> 00:58:39.589]  That's why one pill is like 10 pills of the average brand.
[00:58:39.629 --> 00:58:42.931]  And even the lightweight ones work because turmeric is so amazing.
[00:58:43.731 --> 00:58:51.296]  It's 25% off at InfoWarsTore.com, but we're selling out of it at current sales rates in about two weeks.
[00:58:51.436 --> 00:58:53.197]  So it's going to go back to regular price in a week or so.
[00:58:53.818 --> 00:58:54.458]  We need the funding.
[00:58:56.460 --> 00:59:17.069]  Over a year in development, DietForce, the new X7 brand, is a natural, healthy way to boost your entire metabolic system, particularly your body's capacity to lose weight quickly.
[00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:19.911]  And it does it in a healthy, natural way.

[00:59:26.568 --> 00:59:27.428]  And support the MFulWar.

[00:59:33.531 --> 00:59:34.651]  MFulWarStore.com.
[00:59:34.951 --> 00:59:35.752]  And we need the funds.
[00:59:36.112 --> 00:59:36.612]  Thank you so much.
[00:59:36.632 --> 00:59:37.152]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:38.253 --> 00:59:43.775]  So, my job is a lot easier than it used to be.
[00:59:43.815 --> 00:59:45.656]  That's what they wanted to software a long time ago.
[00:59:46.677 --> 00:59:51.779]  Because they knew when the New World Order went operational, people would really start listening.
[00:59:53.803 --> 00:59:59.345]  Now, we've had different globalist leaders say for a year they're going to bring back lockdowns.
[01:00:00.746 --> 01:00:02.327]  And Biden has said a new variant is coming.
[01:00:03.147 --> 01:00:05.668]  New lockdowns, new pandemics are coming.
[01:00:06.088 --> 01:00:11.951]  You mean more of their tyranny to shut down the world economy, to bankrupt more people, to make us dependent on them is coming.
[01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:17.433]  World Health Organization may declare monkeypox outbreak a global health emergency.
[01:00:18.273 --> 01:00:22.075]  And then now they're saying they are going to declare it a new emergency.
[01:00:23.339 --> 01:00:32.349]  They've activated the panel and say, preparing to declare a new emergency for something that's not even proven to be monkeypox, and mainline science points towards vaccine side effects.
[01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:37.314]  New York City opens mass vaccination sites to combat monkeypox outbreak.
[01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:40.878]  Total hysteria.
[01:00:40.898 --> 01:00:44.222]  And they admit it's almost all, quote, gay men that have it.
[01:00:45.953 --> 01:00:46.113]  Hmm.
[01:00:47.154 --> 01:00:48.976]  Watch a mass mandate looms.
[01:00:49.577 --> 01:00:52.741]  LA hospital officials mock COVID media hype.
[01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:55.944]  Germany to reimpose mass mandate in September.
[01:00:56.465 --> 01:00:59.168]  Told you that was coming despite COVID wave already losing momentum.
[01:01:00.678 --> 01:01:02.479]  It's the armband of their party of fear.
[01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:03.879]  Their symbol of control.
[01:01:03.899 --> 01:01:05.919]  It's like the Nazi armband.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.660]  Or the Trump mega hat.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.701]  I'm not saying any of them themselves are bad.
[01:01:11.281 --> 01:01:12.081]  The Nazis were bad.
[01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:13.101]  The symbol's not bad.
[01:01:13.121 --> 01:01:15.602]  A mask isn't bad, but making you wear it's bad.
[01:01:16.062 --> 01:01:18.383]  A mega hat, you know, means you support American freedom.
[01:01:18.443 --> 01:01:19.063]  It's not bad.
[01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:21.283]  But it becomes a symbol of the party.
[01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:27.465]  A major study confirms COVID vaccines alter women's periods.
[01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.394]  That is a major study.
[01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:33.795]  You can read all about it at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:35.355]  We already knew that, but here it is.
[01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:46.318]  And former top Trump advisor, who was also anti-Trump, Deborah Birx, has come out and said, yeah, it came out of a lab, as if we'd heard her tell us that.
[01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:49.218]  New York City, though, is again hyping the monkeypox.
[01:01:50.059 --> 01:01:51.059]  Represents 30% of the U.S.
[01:01:51.079 --> 01:01:51.759]  cases total.
[01:01:53.647 --> 01:02:01.730]  FBI launches inquiry into NIH funding a Wuhan lab email show two years ago but did absolutely nothing.
[01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:04.831]  That's just some of the news.
[01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:06.071]  Exclusive.
[01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:14.634]  Billions continue to be laundered through the National Institutes of Health to China's bio-warfare program for gain of function.
[01:02:14.694 --> 01:02:15.554]  It all continues.
[01:02:15.995 --> 01:02:20.076]  Gateway Pundit has a great report breaking all of that down.
[01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:25.151]   Canadian court rules it was legal Legal!
[01:02:25.171 --> 01:02:26.192]  It's a dictatorship up there.
[01:02:26.873 --> 01:02:30.375]  To deny a vaccinated person organ transplant.
[01:02:31.116 --> 01:02:32.457]  That's the social credit score.
[01:02:33.037 --> 01:02:34.759]  That's mass murder.
[01:02:36.055 --> 01:02:38.457]  That is absolutely insane.
[01:02:38.937 --> 01:02:41.820]  France court ruled and the government voted.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.422]  Macron is a minority leader now.
[01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:49.807]  By that, it's a parliamentary system, so he has about 30% of the vote, just like Trudeau.
[01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.688]  But he's still in control of the executive.
[01:02:51.728 --> 01:02:55.211]  But the main parliament voted against vaccine mandates.
[01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:58.014]  And so that's starting to fall apart, but not in Canada.
[01:02:58.414 --> 01:03:03.638]   It is really The gold standard now of absolute total tyranny.
[01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:06.921]  We're going to look at more of that here in a moment.
[01:03:06.941 --> 01:03:15.648]  But right now, let's look at this group of stacks that all tie together with the energy shutdown that is taking place right now.
[01:03:16.949 --> 01:03:22.174]  Dutch farmers, Netherlands, a pilot country for the Great Reset Agenda.
[01:03:23.755 --> 01:03:28.079]  And that's their mainline top activists and leaders in the country are saying.
[01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:29.924]  And what are they doing?
[01:03:31.164 --> 01:03:32.185]  We are not slaves.
[01:03:32.285 --> 01:03:43.708]  Farmers in Italy and Spain and Poland join Dutch protesters as the governments impose the same worldwide UN agenda 21, agenda 2030 program to shut down their farms.
[01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:48.489]  Some farmers are having to kill 90% of their cows because of their farts.
[01:03:49.489 --> 01:03:52.490]  The government lists their farts as bad and then bans them.
[01:03:54.406 --> 01:03:59.230]  Meanwhile, satellite images show global crop declines except for Russia and China.
[01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:03.954]  So all over the world, globalist policies have shut down crops except Russia and China.
[01:04:04.234 --> 01:04:08.738]  China shut down a few cities that ship stuff to the U.S.
[01:04:09.398 --> 01:04:13.622]  They've not shut down their farming or their oil refining or anything else.
[01:04:13.662 --> 01:04:16.945]  They have ratcheted that way, way up.
[01:04:17.045 --> 01:04:18.186]  That is the globalist game.
[01:04:19.421 --> 01:04:24.205]  WTO, IMF, and World Bank called for trade restrictions to be lifted to minimize food crisis.
[01:04:24.685 --> 01:04:33.336]   So after they know the three years of lockdowns worldwide, as many years the world went on for, you know, two and a half years, after they Run these policies.
[01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:40.019]  Now they want to take the restrictions off food imports and exports because of mass starvation, now that it's too late.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:44.522]  And it goes on and on from there.
[01:04:45.422 --> 01:04:54.487]  Coming up, I've got some really powerful information on 50 years of failed eco propaganda predictions that have been absolute frauds.
[01:04:54.507 --> 01:04:55.388]  We'll be hitting all that.
[01:04:56.636 --> 01:05:01.059]  Very important information and tying into Biden and his energy clampdown in the U.S.
[01:05:01.159 --> 01:05:04.401]  On the other side, in about three minutes we got a break, but here's some more reports.
[01:05:05.942 --> 01:05:11.866]  Saudi diplomat, head diplomat, dodges on boosting oil production, claims high U.S.
[01:05:11.886 --> 01:05:13.867]  gas prices due to Biden policies.
[01:05:13.907 --> 01:05:15.989]  Well, that's an okay headline in Infowars.
[01:05:16.049 --> 01:05:21.272]  I didn't write the article, not bashing who did, but Saudi Arabia has boosted oil output the last three years.
[01:05:21.312 --> 01:05:22.713]  They boosted it again last year.
[01:05:23.374 --> 01:05:27.400]   And what their ambassador said, Is the truth.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:35.184]  He said Biden has shut down oil exploration and refining in the United States and the pipelines.
[01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:36.264]  And that's why.
[01:05:36.484 --> 01:05:37.965]  And that's admitted to the industry.
[01:05:38.005 --> 01:05:38.245]  Why?
[01:05:38.725 --> 01:05:39.766]  It's not the Saudis.
[01:05:40.886 --> 01:05:42.787]  It's not the local gas stations.
[01:05:43.087 --> 01:05:50.991]  It's Biden and the Great Reset and Klaus Schwab and this big transition they say we're in.
[01:05:52.498 --> 01:05:55.560]  Oil prices blame for inflation when the driver is really food.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:56.841]  It's a zero hedge.
[01:05:58.743 --> 01:06:00.144]  Bloomberg Markets commentator.
[01:06:02.205 --> 01:06:05.148]  It's not even food that's gone up so much more than fuel.
[01:06:05.408 --> 01:06:06.929]  It's that they devalued the currencies.
[01:06:06.969 --> 01:06:07.850]  That's the main driver.
[01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:10.832]  And it goes on from there.
[01:06:12.553 --> 01:06:14.394]  So we're living in quite the moment.
[01:06:14.815 --> 01:06:16.156]  Here's a key Bellwether article.
[01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:23.024]  Western dominance to be replaced by bipolar world order, ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair says.
[01:06:23.364 --> 01:06:28.488]  The big Bilderberg Group operative tells you they're replacing America as the main power.
[01:06:28.828 --> 01:06:32.790]  So, they're running America with these policies into the ground by design.
[01:06:33.671 --> 01:06:40.475]  UN Secretary General fighting misinformation, a matter of life and death, particularly American disinformation about vaccines and more.
[01:06:40.795 --> 01:06:43.377]  Except everything they've told us has been a lie, and we know that.
[01:06:46.823 --> 01:06:48.605]  They really are panicked right now.
[01:06:48.625 --> 01:06:51.027]  We've got a few of these videos coming up too.
[01:06:51.448 --> 01:06:56.192]  World Economic Forum says gas prices must go even higher to save democracy.
[01:06:56.252 --> 01:06:59.456]  Yes, it saves the people by bankrupting them.
[01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:05.602]  Another compilation of Klaus Schwab two years ago saying the supply chains will be destroyed by COVID.
[01:07:05.682 --> 01:07:06.823]  No, the lockdowns did that.
[01:07:07.343 --> 01:07:09.786]  That would create the Great Reset, the collapse they wanted.
[01:07:11.511 --> 01:07:15.896]  Isn't that simply amazing?
[01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:40.957]   But when we come back, oh do we have a stack of information that's so critical, dealing with The lies that the Club of Rome and Bilderberg Group have put out since the early 60s about scarcity to sell you on the idea of being poor, to sell you on the idea of them controlling every facet of your life by doing just that.
[01:07:41.998 --> 01:07:48.403]  It is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side of this quick break.
[01:07:49.164 --> 01:07:56.147]   And if you haven't shared the URL, InfoWars.com today or may not have been ago, Please do it, because it's so important to win this fight.
[01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:56.628]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:56.648 --> 01:08:03.472]  At least eight times in the past million years, it has advanced and retreated with clockwork regularity.
[01:08:04.433 --> 01:08:11.178]  If we are unprepared for the next advance, the result could be hunger and death on a scale unprecedented in all of history.
[01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:17.562]  What scientists are telling us now is that the threat of an ice age is not as remote as they once thought.
[01:08:18.459 --> 01:08:33.189]  During the lifetime of our grandchildren, Arctic cold and perpetual snow could turn most of the inhabitable portions of our planet into a polar desert.
[01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:38.873]  In 1977, the worst winter in a century struck the United States.
[01:08:39.193 --> 01:08:43.656]  Arctic cold gripped the Midwest for weeks on end.
[01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:49.085]  Great blizzards paralyzed cities of the Northeast.
[01:08:49.185 --> 01:08:54.490]  One desperate night in Buffalo, eight people froze to death in marooned cars.
[01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:58.093]  Pat Bushnell was on the road that night.
[01:08:58.133 --> 01:09:00.275]  Traffic just absolutely stopped.
[01:09:00.475 --> 01:09:07.240]  I was afraid of being stuck in the car all night long with the cold and the wind running out of gas.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.661]  And then what?
[01:09:08.782 --> 01:09:18.249]   I think that if we had to go through a real bad winter, just like we just went through, I think we'd have to think about moving someplace else.
[01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:20.290]  Move where?
[01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:28.296]  The brutal Buffalo winter might become common all over the United States.
[01:09:28.336 --> 01:09:31.318]  Climate experts believe the next ice age is on its way.
[01:09:31.338 --> 01:09:39.103]  According to recent evidence, it could come sooner than anyone had expected.
[01:09:39.183 --> 01:09:44.367]  At weather stations in the far north, temperatures have been dropping for 30 years.
[01:09:46.077 --> 01:09:50.140]  Seacoasts long free of summer ice are now blocked year-round.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:10:00.606]  According to some climatologists, within a lifetime, we might be living in the next ice age.
[01:10:00.645 --> 01:10:06.645]   Of the nine planets in our solar system, only Earth has conditions favorable to human life.
[01:10:06.645 --> 01:10:23.645]   The reason I wanted to show that from the late 1970s, with Leonard Nimoy, is that was real.
[01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:26.228]  We know there's a 12,000-year ice age cycle.
[01:10:26.248 --> 01:10:27.368]  We're very close to it right now.
[01:10:28.008 --> 01:10:35.750]  It is true that human greenhouse gas emissions in the Industrial Revolution the last 200 years has raised temperatures maybe a point.
[01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:42.711]  And they've done equations, the real climatologists, the real meteorologists, that show that we've been holding it up.
[01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:45.272]  We've been terraforming the planet to stop it.
[01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:50.150]  And they've lied and said we're having the hottest summer in Texas record.
[01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:51.912]  But now they've gone back and looked.
[01:10:51.972 --> 01:10:54.954]  I remember playing football in two days in the late 1980s.
[01:10:55.394 --> 01:10:59.998]  They had to cancel it in Dallas because of weeks of 115 degree temperature.
[01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:04.622]  And I saw the thermometer on our back porch at my house saying 115.
[01:11:04.662 --> 01:11:05.002]  Now they say 110.
[01:11:05.042 --> 01:11:06.803]  Last week's a Texas record.
[01:11:06.623 --> 01:11:14.063]   say 110 last week's a Texas record even though in the school I went to somebody
[01:11:14.063 --> 01:11:18.503]   died of a heart attack one of the football players in 115 degree
[01:11:18.503 --> 01:11:28.235]   temperatures in what 1989 And three died that summer in Dallas, until they suspended the two-a-days.
[01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:33.180]  I experienced the 115 degree temperature about 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:37.604]  I experienced two-a-days being canceled, which I thought was great, or cut to one-a-day.
[01:11:38.607 --> 01:11:43.370]  I know it hit 115, so I knew weeks ago when they said, highest temperature ever in Texas, 110!
[01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:45.531]  That's a lie.
[01:11:45.552 --> 01:11:50.695]  There's a lot of viral clips out there going around right now in England.
[01:11:51.816 --> 01:11:56.138]  Yeah, they're having the hottest summer in over a decade, but they've had it hotter than this many times.
[01:11:56.158 --> 01:12:03.025]   They used to show it as sunny and yellow on the meteorological Weather man boards.
[01:12:03.425 --> 01:12:09.051]  Now they showed us red and call it the end of the world and say there's no power because they're cutting the power off.
[01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:12.434]  That's the same blueprint, the same playbook everywhere.
[01:12:12.734 --> 01:12:13.295]  Here's a clip.
[01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.581]  Here we're looking at around 21 or 22 as a maximum temperature.
[01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:25.324]  But in the southeast already we're a degree or so higher than yesterday, so we could well equal the record high temperature of 37 degrees Celsius.
[01:12:25.364 --> 01:12:31.386]  By the time we get to Sunday, the heat becomes more widespread across the UK and temperatures in the mid-30s.
[01:12:33.387 --> 01:12:36.969]  Temperatures in the mid-30s this week, they say, is the hottest ever in England.
[01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:42.871]  You just saw a report from decades before with it two degrees higher.
[01:12:44.462 --> 01:12:47.783]  They're lying their asses off.
[01:12:48.363 --> 01:13:01.589]  I have looked at a thermometer on the back porch of our house in Dallas, Texas when I was 13 years old and not wanting to go to the second round of two-a-days and seen it at 115.
[01:13:01.429 --> 01:13:10.229]  and 115. But the media says 110 highest ever. Liars.
[01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:11.626]  Frauds.
[01:13:12.546 --> 01:13:13.126]  Scammers.
[01:13:13.906 --> 01:13:14.607]  Manipulators.
[01:13:15.327 --> 01:13:16.567]  Here's a headline.
[01:13:16.587 --> 01:13:16.567]  1971.
[01:13:16.647 --> 01:13:17.728]  New Ice Age is coming.
[01:13:21.589 --> 01:13:22.269]  New York Times.
[01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:24.390]  Wrong again.
[01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:28.831]  50 years of failed eco.
[01:13:30.611 --> 01:13:30.972]  Lies.
[01:13:31.132 --> 01:13:34.133]  And this is an article that backs up what I'm about to read on air.
[01:13:34.753 --> 01:13:35.593]  It's an excellent article.
[01:13:35.613 --> 01:13:38.194]  I'm going to link to it in the live show feed from CEI.org.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:42.221]  And it's got the 50 years of lying.
[01:13:42.882 --> 01:13:49.866]  The 50 years of the floods are going to destroy the coast and the water is going to raise 10 feet and acid rain is going to kill you.
[01:13:50.206 --> 01:13:55.229]  Every one of the articles here I'm about to just read the disinfo points from.
[01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:06.876]  This is the best recap of the history since 1966 when the Club of Rome put out the climate hysteria in 63 and within three years they had the whole media behind it they owned.
[01:14:08.939 --> 01:14:13.041]  1966, oil gone, exhausted totally in 10 years.
[01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:13.041]  66.
[01:14:14.461 --> 01:14:16.922]  67, dire famine forecast for 75.
[01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:21.004]  68, overpopulation will spread worldwide.
[01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:24.365]  69, everyone will disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 89.
[01:14:25.446 --> 01:14:27.567]  1970, world will use up all the natural resources by 2000.
[01:14:30.228 --> 01:14:33.069]  1970.
[01:14:30.648 --> 01:14:33.069]  Urban citizens will require gas masks by 1985.
[01:14:33.889 --> 01:14:33.069]  1970.
[01:14:34.409 --> 01:14:38.971]  Nitrogen buildup, that's why they're banning the cows everywhere, will make all land unusable.
[01:14:38.991 --> 01:14:38.971]  1970.
[01:14:39.271 --> 01:14:41.412]  They're banning the cows everywhere on that line.
[01:14:42.392 --> 01:14:46.393]  Decaying pollution will kill all the fish.
[01:14:46.413 --> 01:14:46.393]  1970.
[01:14:46.433 --> 01:14:47.353]  1970.
[01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:47.353]  Killer bees.
[01:14:47.373 --> 01:14:47.353]  1970.
[01:14:47.193 --> 01:14:52.193]  1970, 1970, killer bees, 1970, I saved by 2000, 1970.
[01:14:52.193 --> 01:14:54.193]  1970.
[01:14:54.341 --> 01:14:58.586]  America's subject to water rationing by 74 and food rationing by 1980.
[01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:01.649]  But they're gonna do this artificially now, you see.
[01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.531]  This is their excuse.
[01:15:03.772 --> 01:15:03.531]  1971.
[01:15:03.852 --> 01:15:05.213]  New Ice Age coming by 2020.
[01:15:05.774 --> 01:15:06.375]  Didn't happen either.
[01:15:08.377 --> 01:15:11.738]  1972, new ice age by 2070.
[01:15:11.778 --> 01:15:14.839]  1972, oil depleted in 20 years.
[01:15:14.859 --> 01:15:18.880]  1974, space satellites show new ice age coming fast.
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:20.621]  1974, another ice age.
[01:15:20.901 --> 01:15:23.241]  1974, ozone depletion, a great peril to life.
[01:15:24.122 --> 01:15:28.543]  1976, scientific consensus, planet cooling, famines imminent.
[01:15:28.563 --> 01:15:32.764]  1977, Department of Energy says oil will peak in the 90s.
[01:15:32.984 --> 01:15:35.365]  1978, no end in sight for 30 year cooling trim.
[01:15:36.505 --> 01:15:39.727]  1980.
[01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:39.727]  Acid rain kills life in all lakes.
[01:15:39.747 --> 01:15:39.727]  1980.
[01:15:39.967 --> 01:15:41.868]  Peak oil in 2000.
[01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:41.868]  1988.
[01:15:42.428 --> 01:15:46.270]  Regional droughts that never happened in the 1990s.
[01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:46.270]  1988.
[01:15:46.351 --> 01:15:47.451]  Temperature in D.C.
[01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:48.692]  will hit record highs.
[01:15:49.252 --> 01:15:48.692]  1988.
[01:15:51.393 --> 01:15:53.174]  Moldavia islands will be underwater by 2018.
[01:15:53.214 --> 01:15:53.474]  They're not.
[01:15:56.389 --> 01:15:59.832]  1989, rising sea levels will obliterate nations, if nothing done by 2000.
[01:15:59.872 --> 01:16:02.094]  1989, New York City's West Side Highway underwater by 2019.
[01:16:02.254 --> 01:16:03.095]  It's not.
[01:16:03.115 --> 01:16:03.655]  1996, peak oil by 2020.
[01:16:03.695 --> 01:16:04.596]  2000, children won't know what snow is in 2000.
[01:16:04.436 --> 01:16:12.315]   It's not. 1996, peak oil by 2020. 2000, children won't know what snow is in 2000.
[01:16:12.315 --> 01:16:19.795]   2002, famine in 10 years, we don't give up eating fish, meat and dairy.
[01:16:18.348 --> 01:16:19.689]  Peak oil in 2010.
[01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:19.689]  2004.
[01:16:20.829 --> 01:16:23.470]  Britain will be Siberia by 2024.
[01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:25.430]  Now it's the hottest ever, they claim.
[01:16:25.771 --> 01:16:25.430]  2025.
[01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:27.031]  Manhattan underwater by 2015.
[01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:27.031]  2006.
[01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:29.452]  Super hurricanes.
[01:16:29.872 --> 01:16:29.452]  2000.
[01:16:30.292 --> 01:16:32.353]  It was the weakest hurricanes ever after that.
[01:16:32.973 --> 01:16:32.353]  2008.
[01:16:33.113 --> 01:16:35.013]  Arctic will be ice-free by 2018.
[01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:35.754]  It's not.
[01:16:35.954 --> 01:16:37.714]  It's the biggest ever.
[01:16:38.114 --> 01:16:39.915]  Climate.
[01:16:39.935 --> 01:16:39.915]  2008.
[01:16:40.315 --> 01:16:42.376]  Geniuses Al Gore predicts ice-free Arctic 2013.
[01:16:44.817 --> 01:16:49.182]  2009.
[01:16:45.198 --> 01:16:49.182]  Climate genius Prince Charles says we have 96 months to save the world.
[01:16:49.202 --> 01:16:52.126]  You see, AOC saying that later.
[01:16:52.146 --> 01:16:52.126]  2009.
[01:16:52.226 --> 01:16:55.730]  UK Prime Minister says 50 days to save the planet from catastrophe.
[01:16:56.771 --> 01:16:55.730]  2009.
[01:16:56.851 --> 01:16:59.234]  Climate genius Al Gore.
[01:16:59.254 --> 01:17:00.195]  2013 prediction of ice-free. 2014.
[01:17:02.757 --> 01:17:03.918]  2013, Arctic ice free by 2015.
[01:17:04.358 --> 01:17:09.400]  2014, only 50 days before climate chaos.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:13.021]  2019, hey Greta, we need you to convince them there's really going to happen this time.
[01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:14.201]  And that's just some of it.
[01:17:14.521 --> 01:17:16.282]  I mean, come on, people!
[01:17:17.322 --> 01:17:26.565]  The real problem is genetic engineering, and radiation, and blowing up power plants, and nuclear war, and collapsing currencies, and deadly poison shots.
[01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.226]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:17:29.324 --> 01:17:30.164]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:32.005]  The story you're about to see is truth.
[01:17:32.365 --> 01:17:33.585]  This is reality.
[01:17:33.965 --> 01:17:35.966]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:17:37.966 --> 01:17:40.927]  I'm the most banned, most demonized media person in the world.
[01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:42.328]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:17:42.368 --> 01:17:43.568]  He's a performance artist.
[01:17:43.628 --> 01:17:46.329]  I'm perceived as a clown, a nut, a maniac.
[01:17:47.751 --> 01:17:51.834]  On his website, InfoWars, he touts paranoia porn.
[01:17:52.415 --> 01:17:54.916]  The sickest, most offensive theories.
[01:17:55.457 --> 01:18:00.901]  Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:18:01.041 --> 01:18:02.462]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[01:18:02.822 --> 01:18:04.724]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.066]  Ain't that something?
[01:18:08.266 --> 01:18:08.927]  You'll burn in hell!
[01:18:09.827 --> 01:18:10.888]  I met him back in 1990s.
[01:18:11.028 --> 01:18:13.890]  I knew right away he was gonna be a star.
[01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:15.211]  How's my hair look?
[01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:18.073]  I saw all these conspiracy theorists that were talking about the New World Order.
[01:18:18.173 --> 01:18:19.054]  And I thought, that's what I'll do.
[01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:19.714]  Get it, Alex.
[01:18:19.734 --> 01:18:22.517]  Death to the New World Order!
[01:18:22.537 --> 01:18:26.740]  It was that attack on humanity that I saw early on that I really wanted to wage war on.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.800]  You're lying to the public.
[01:18:27.941 --> 01:18:28.681]  It's disgusting.
[01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:30.963]  Once you taste that, there's no going back.
[01:18:33.405 --> 01:18:34.206]  Everything's a war.
[01:18:34.306 --> 01:18:35.628]  That's the way the universe works.
[01:18:35.869 --> 01:18:37.150]  And everything is propaganda.
[01:18:37.691 --> 01:18:42.318]  I don't trust Donald Trump, but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says.
[01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:44.120]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:18:44.581 --> 01:18:45.923]  I will not let you down.
[01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:48.747]  That's what the media just loves on.
[01:18:49.878 --> 01:18:54.581]  Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children, was fake.
[01:18:54.842 --> 01:18:56.903]  I try to tell the truth and sometimes I'm wrong.
[01:18:57.183 --> 01:19:03.608]  Did the New York Times get in trouble for consciously lying about WMDs that then led to a war that killed tens of thousands in conflict?
[01:19:03.688 --> 01:19:04.008]  No.
[01:19:05.249 --> 01:19:07.190]  The attempts to de-platform us have failed.
[01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:09.832]  They have the CIA, the FBI following me around.
[01:19:10.052 --> 01:19:11.654]  Now we've got to destroy Alex Jones.
[01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:12.854]  We're not playing games here.
[01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:16.417]  This is such a historic moment together.
[01:19:16.557 --> 01:19:17.298]  USA!
[01:19:17.578 --> 01:19:17.698]  USA!
[01:19:18.911 --> 01:19:19.692]  It's all just insane.
[01:19:20.733 --> 01:19:22.814]  Okay, let's put me in prison for questioning, okay?
[01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:23.695]  Even though that's my right.
[01:19:23.975 --> 01:19:25.436]  In fact, let's execute Alex Jones.
[01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:29.760]  Let's put him in front of a firing squad, pull the trigger.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:31.001]  I have a sick feeling, actually.
[01:19:31.021 --> 01:19:36.205]  Because I know what comes next.
[01:19:39.087 --> 01:19:40.908]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't own this film.
[01:19:40.968 --> 01:19:42.630]  I'm not invested in this film, but...
[01:19:44.284 --> 01:19:51.046]  On its way from a factory in Chicago right now are 20,000 copies of Alex's War.
[01:19:52.626 --> 01:19:55.707]  And I gotta say, it brought tears to my eyes watching the two-hour, 11-minute film.
[01:19:56.727 --> 01:19:59.888]  Everybody wants it on DVD because you don't want to be able to censor it.
[01:20:00.468 --> 01:20:02.348]  You can get it discounted with 2,000 mules.
[01:20:02.408 --> 01:20:04.589]  Everybody needs it in their library, in their archive.
[01:20:05.389 --> 01:20:06.469]  Get Alex's War.
[01:20:06.829 --> 01:20:08.250]  It'll start shipping July 29th.
[01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.490]  That is only in about 11 days from now.
[01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:20.652]  The truck gets here in three days on Thursday.
[01:20:21.893 --> 01:20:27.517]  We won't start shipping them, but we'll have them packaged and ready to ship to you on the 29th.
[01:20:28.338 --> 01:20:30.960]  And film is avant-garde.
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.961]  Film is the real cultural battle.
[01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:40.006]  And I said no to a lot of documentaries, but I had seen this filmmaker's work, and it isn't a puff piece.
[01:20:40.066 --> 01:20:41.207]  It's not even pro Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.568 --> 01:20:42.848]  It really shows what we've done.
[01:20:43.875 --> 01:20:45.657]  And it's very important.
[01:20:45.677 --> 01:20:52.543]  So I hope you go to infowarestore.com and get Alex's war now so you'll have it in your archive.
[01:20:53.304 --> 01:20:57.387]  I can tell you that this will break in the news in the next few days.
[01:20:59.069 --> 01:21:07.016]  There has been sabotage at movie theaters in Austin and New York and Los Angeles where it's going to premiere the 29th.
[01:21:08.557 --> 01:21:14.910]   Glenn Greenwald is Coming to Austin this Saturday.
[01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:16.851]  They're doing a screening of it.
[01:21:17.591 --> 01:21:18.171]  I'll be there.
[01:21:18.271 --> 01:21:22.152]  And I told them that you're going to have thousands trying to go.
[01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:22.992]  That's already happened.
[01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:25.353]  So they're adding more screens, the rest of it.
[01:21:26.293 --> 01:21:29.414]  But the point is, that's just a screening or a premiere.
[01:21:30.495 --> 01:21:32.195]  But they're really, really scared of this.
[01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:37.023]   And I appreciate Glenn Greenwald having Support for free speech.
[01:21:38.243 --> 01:21:40.565]  And he's going to interview myself and the director of the film.
[01:21:40.585 --> 01:21:43.887]  And we're going to interview Glenn Greenwald coming up this weekend.
[01:21:45.108 --> 01:21:47.029]  And so that's all set to happen.
[01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:52.893]  But this film is right behind Top Gun in pre-sales.
[01:21:54.614 --> 01:21:56.155]  And that's great for the filmmakers.
[01:21:56.235 --> 01:21:58.436]  It's great to have freedom be so popular.
[01:21:59.297 --> 01:22:13.569]   And there's been a lot of chicanery behind the scenes they've asked me not to get into yet, but it's been Unbelievable what has gone on with them trying to stop this that is set to go to number one behind Top Gun.
[01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.910]  I'll explain that again.
[01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:18.333]  Top Gun on the charts is number one.
[01:22:18.353 --> 01:22:19.554]  It's not just Apple.
[01:22:20.274 --> 01:22:20.955]  We are number two.
[01:22:24.358 --> 01:22:25.959]  That scares the system.
[01:22:26.019 --> 01:22:30.123]  It shows how incredibly popular freedom is.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.161]  And I'm very, very excited.
[01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:38.483]  But if you want to be the first to see it, infowarestore.com, Alex's War.
[01:22:39.823 --> 01:22:41.164]  And look, I miscalculated.
[01:22:41.244 --> 01:22:48.086]  You know, I thought that if I bought, I mean, I told Dinesh D'Souza, I said, hey, give me 60% off on your film.
[01:22:49.827 --> 01:22:52.088]  I want to buy 20,000 DVDs from you.
[01:22:52.788 --> 01:22:55.169]  I think your film is so important, proving election fraud.
[01:22:57.071 --> 01:22:58.071]  And I bought 20,000 of them.
[01:22:58.211 --> 01:23:01.013]  We've only sold like, I don't know what it is, 12,000 of the DVDs.
[01:23:01.073 --> 01:23:02.013]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:23:02.073 --> 01:23:02.873]  It proves fraud.
[01:23:03.333 --> 01:23:05.674]  Show it to your church, show it to your school, show it to your neighbors.
[01:23:08.715 --> 01:23:10.896]  That film is just sitting there at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:23:10.936 --> 01:23:13.157]  So we have the two films together.
[01:23:14.958 --> 01:23:17.339]  So you have them in your archives so they can't delete them.
[01:23:17.839 --> 01:23:18.979]  So they can't shut them down.
[01:23:18.999 --> 01:23:19.880]  It's so simple.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:24.161]  But Alex's War is doing a lot better than I thought.
[01:23:24.261 --> 01:23:25.722]  You know, DeSouza's film, great film.
[01:23:26.607 --> 01:23:30.050]  It got up the top 30 on platforms.
[01:23:31.211 --> 01:23:39.197]  This film has gone to number two behind the biggest movie they're saying in history now, bigger than Titanic, bigger than Empire Strikes Back.
[01:23:40.794 --> 01:23:44.257]  Top Gun, which I thought, you know, the first one's really cheesy.
[01:23:44.697 --> 01:23:46.539]  I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan.
[01:23:46.619 --> 01:23:47.439]  I don't dislike him.
[01:23:47.459 --> 01:23:51.162]  You know, he's against the drugging of kids and all the rest of it.
[01:23:51.182 --> 01:23:55.286]  But, you know, he makes people wear masks on the set and is a prima donna.
[01:23:55.666 --> 01:23:56.427]  So he's a weirdo.
[01:23:57.407 --> 01:24:00.690]  And I know a lot of the inside baseball from Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez.
[01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:03.512]  He lived with him for two years before his career took off.
[01:24:04.853 --> 01:24:05.994]  So I know a lot about Tom Cruise.
[01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:08.817]  But Maverick.
[01:24:09.625 --> 01:24:10.446]  Top Gun Maverick.
[01:24:10.486 --> 01:24:13.387]  I went and saw it and was like, wow, this is actually pro-America.
[01:24:14.328 --> 01:24:15.929]  This is not anti-America.
[01:24:16.289 --> 01:24:19.791]  And I guess you're so used to anti-America, you see something that's pro-America, you go, wow, this is great.
[01:24:21.172 --> 01:24:23.273]  Biggest movie in history.
[01:24:24.273 --> 01:24:25.254]  Top Gun Maverick.
[01:24:25.314 --> 01:24:26.895]  And we are number two behind it.
[01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:32.158]  What message does that send to the globalists?
[01:24:32.598 --> 01:24:33.859]  People are sick of you.
[01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:34.760]  They're done with you.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.861]  All their SJW movies are flopping.
[01:24:37.561 --> 01:24:38.682]  Hollywood is imploding.
[01:24:40.509 --> 01:24:47.608]  You can get 2,000 Mules, The Order of Death, The Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and Alex's War, four films, three DVDs.
[01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:52.212]  We're 50% off, as well, InfoWarshaw.com.
[01:24:52.272 --> 01:24:58.357]  And yeah, I'm sitting there promoting products because they're great products you already need and we need to stay on air.

[01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:01.419]  Spread the word about them.
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:02.640]  Support their sponsors.
[01:25:03.381 --> 01:25:04.742]  Tithe your local station.
[01:25:05.042 --> 01:25:11.508]  So many stations have taken us from being on at night to live because you're making donations to stations that never got donations before.
[01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:12.329]  Keep it up, folks.
[01:25:12.689 --> 01:25:20.436]   We've gone from 150 affiliates Our peak was 200 years ago to almost 400 right now because of you.
[01:25:21.336 --> 01:25:30.625]  Keep it up, listeners, and support those AM and FM affiliates as well and the TV affiliates and cable affiliates that are picking up the show.
[01:25:30.645 --> 01:25:32.086]  The left is so upset about that.
[01:25:33.427 --> 01:25:35.609]  When I'm in depositions, they're like, who are your affiliates?
[01:25:35.989 --> 01:25:36.530]  Where are they?
[01:25:36.610 --> 01:25:37.451]  What are your satellites?
[01:25:37.831 --> 01:25:38.732]  How do we shut those down?
[01:25:39.252 --> 01:25:41.134]  And I go, it's free to air cupcake.
[01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:48.573]  Anybody, whether you're a pirate radio station or commercial radio station, whether you're a TV station, I don't care.
[01:25:49.554 --> 01:25:57.177]  It's all free to air, meaning we own the show, we put it out, but you can do whatever you want with any of it.
[01:25:57.578 --> 01:26:00.399]  Edit it, slice it up, make a film, I don't care.
[01:26:00.819 --> 01:26:03.381]  We don't go after anybody for using our material.
[01:26:03.441 --> 01:26:04.821]  We want you to use it.
[01:26:04.861 --> 01:26:06.202]  We beg you to use it.
[01:26:06.482 --> 01:26:09.204]  We believe the power of the people is paramount.
[01:26:09.924 --> 01:26:13.226]  I spent a lot of time in the first hour on this and Sunday night the whole show on it.
[01:26:14.607 --> 01:26:18.969]  They've openly are trying to make the presidency a dictatorship over the military domestically.
[01:26:19.229 --> 01:26:35.788]  We're going to expose it next hour.
[01:26:36.362 --> 01:26:39.726]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[01:26:40.627 --> 01:26:44.331]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[01:26:45.052 --> 01:26:47.314]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[01:26:47.995 --> 01:26:55.157]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[01:26:55.858 --> 01:27:00.579]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:07.462]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[01:27:08.562 --> 01:27:18.228]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[01:27:18.828 --> 01:27:22.470]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[01:27:23.511 --> 01:27:41.990]  Stock up now at preparetoday.com.
[01:27:42.075 --> 01:27:46.979]  You might think it's okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie.
[01:27:47.039 --> 01:27:48.220]  You might think that's okay.
[01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:48.901]  I don't.
[01:27:49.441 --> 01:28:02.633]  As the Washington Times reported, Representative Adam Schiff wants a defense policy bill to include language blocking Congress from oversight of the military and National Guard, in some cases of domestic deployment.
[01:28:02.793 --> 01:28:08.699]  The exemption from congressional oversight is narrowly focused on the domestic deployment of troops.
[01:28:08.999 --> 01:28:18.867]  But Mr. Schiff's free pass for the Pentagon could impact a range of oversight from border security to the January 6th riot at the U.S.
[01:28:18.887 --> 01:28:19.307]  Capitol.
[01:28:19.748 --> 01:28:20.188]  The U.S.
[01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:27.214]  military is not allowed to be involved in any way, even the most minor way, involved in domestic politics.
[01:28:27.554 --> 01:28:29.215]  So this suggests the U.S.
[01:28:29.255 --> 01:28:32.258]  military under Joe Biden is involved in domestic politics.
[01:28:32.498 --> 01:28:43.326]  Well, we also know, Tucker, from reporting by Newsweek, that said that military assets were involved in January 6th, even leading up to the events of January 6th.
[01:28:43.546 --> 01:28:45.568]  What was the military doing?
[01:28:45.808 --> 01:28:49.871]  And we know that the military was fully hostile to Donald Trump.
[01:28:49.951 --> 01:28:56.356]  His own military leaders, including Mark Milley, were completely hostile to the president at that point.
[01:28:56.776 --> 01:29:04.522]  Ray Epps, not Jacob Chansley or Joe Biggs, should be the poster boy for the supposed insurrection on January 6th.
[01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:16.251]  As Revolver News reported, Ray Epps has turned out to be perhaps the only person nailed dead to rights confessing on camera to plotting a pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:25.819]  On both January 5th and January 6th, Epps announced multiple times at multiple locations his upcoming plot to breach the U.S.
[01:29:25.879 --> 01:29:26.299]  Capitol.
[01:29:26.499 --> 01:29:27.599]  We need to go into the Capitol!
[01:29:27.659 --> 01:29:28.300]  Into the Capitol!
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:28.360]  No!
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:28.740]  Peacefully!
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:28.820]  Fed!
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:29.120]  Fed!

[01:29:32.181 --> 01:29:32.281]  Fed!
[01:29:32.561 --> 01:29:32.641]  Fed!
[01:29:33.102 --> 01:29:33.262]  Fed!
[01:29:33.502 --> 01:29:33.562]  Fed!
[01:29:33.742 --> 01:29:33.802]  Fed!
[01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:34.102]  Fed!
[01:29:34.422 --> 01:29:34.602]  Fed!
[01:29:34.822 --> 01:29:34.882]  Fed!
[01:29:35.162 --> 01:29:35.222]  Fed!
[01:29:35.462 --> 01:29:35.522]  Fed!
[01:29:35.723 --> 01:29:35.783]  Fed!
[01:29:36.023 --> 01:29:36.083]  Fed!
[01:29:36.503 --> 01:29:36.603]  Fed!
[01:29:37.083 --> 01:29:37.203]  Fed!
[01:29:37.523 --> 01:29:37.583]  Fed!
[01:29:37.783 --> 01:29:37.863]  Fed!
[01:29:38.183 --> 01:29:38.244]  Fed!
[01:29:38.704 --> 01:29:38.804]  Fed!
[01:29:39.264 --> 01:29:39.364]  Fed!
[01:29:39.804 --> 01:29:39.904]  Fed!
[01:29:40.244 --> 01:29:40.324]  Fed!
[01:29:40.885 --> 01:29:41.065]  Fed!
[01:29:41.465 --> 01:29:41.605]  Fed!
[01:29:41.845 --> 01:29:41.945]  Fed!
[01:29:42.145 --> 01:29:42.225]  Fed!
[01:29:42.245 --> 01:29:42.365]  Fed!
[01:29:42.244 --> 01:29:47.765]   attempting to recruit hundreds of others to join him. On top of it all, Efts was seen
[01:29:47.765 --> 01:29:53.385]   leading key people and managing key aspects of the initial breach of the Capitol grounds
[01:29:53.385 --> 01:29:54.244]  himself.
[01:29:54.244 --> 01:29:56.244]  It's far! It's that direction!
[01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:57.971]  Please spread the word!
[01:29:58.051 --> 01:30:00.351]  All right, no Dave, but one more thing.
[01:30:00.411 --> 01:30:02.172]  Yeah, so can we go up there?
[01:30:02.212 --> 01:30:02.352]  No.
[01:30:02.372 --> 01:30:04.092]  When we go in, leave this here.
[01:30:04.312 --> 01:30:06.873]  Are we going to get arrested if we go up there?
[01:30:06.933 --> 01:30:08.393]  You don't need to get shot.
[01:30:08.212 --> 01:30:28.212]   During the fog of war of the events following January 6th, Ray Epps and the actors surrounding
[01:30:28.212 --> 01:30:31.172]  him were hunted by the FBI and the New York Times.
[01:30:31.257 --> 01:30:36.121]  Now Epps isn't even mentioned during Schiff's January 6th committee hearings.
[01:30:36.361 --> 01:30:43.628]  And now the New York Times has painted Epps as a victim of conspiracy theory, creating its own conspiracy theory.
[01:30:43.828 --> 01:30:48.592]  The piece describes Ray Epps as a disappointed Trump supporter.
[01:30:48.992 --> 01:30:50.253]  Well, here's the only thing.
[01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:53.914]  Ray Epps, as far as we know, did not go to the speech.
[01:30:54.514 --> 01:31:05.258]  Here is the alleged Trump supporter, Ray Epps, who traveled all the way from Arizona to Washington, D.C., and doesn't even attend the speech?
[01:31:05.558 --> 01:31:17.163]  Meanwhile, 69-year-old grandmother Pam Hemphill from Idaho, who suffers from breast cancer and has no criminal history, just began her 60-day sentence.
[01:31:17.503 --> 01:31:21.006]  Mom, what do you have to say to the American people as your last words before you go in?
[01:31:21.526 --> 01:31:22.247]  Keep your faith.
[01:31:22.847 --> 01:31:25.529]  No matter what's going on in your life, God's with us.
[01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:31.474]  No matter what's happening to us, do what's right and help make this country better again.
[01:31:31.694 --> 01:31:33.756]  Your government wants you to know it hates you.
[01:31:34.136 --> 01:31:53.142]  As they cover up further evidence, according to The Intercept, the Secret Service erased text messages from January 5th and January 6th, 2021, though the Secret Service maintains that the text messages were lost as a result of a device replacement program.
[01:31:53.282 --> 01:32:02.345]  The letter to The Intercept says the erasure took place shortly after oversight officials requested the agency's electronic communications.
[01:32:02.645 --> 01:32:07.568]  The United States wasn't forged by bug-eyed corporate prostitutes.
[01:32:07.849 --> 01:32:27.522]  The revolutionary fortitude of the invigorating human spirit imbued in the Declaration of Independence are alien concepts to those who would twist the very character of our nation to fulfill the half-baked whims of their foreign globalist masters and their dwindling party.
[01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.903]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:32:30.037 --> 01:32:33.703]  We are living in an incredibly historic moment right now.
[01:32:35.976 --> 01:32:43.902]  Yes, different elements of the federal government in the last 60 years have tried to have the military encroach on domestic operations.
[01:32:43.963 --> 01:32:48.166]  Yes, they've tried REC-84 and Garden Plot and Cable Splicer.
[01:32:48.226 --> 01:32:51.108]  And yes, Obama said he wanted a domestic security force.
[01:32:51.168 --> 01:32:53.650]  It's as big and as strong as our military.
[01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:55.552]  But now we see troops around the Capitol.
[01:32:55.932 --> 01:32:58.234]  Now we see the main threat being American extremists.
[01:32:58.514 --> 01:33:00.116]  Now we hear they want to ban our guns.
[01:33:00.196 --> 01:33:05.249]   It's now all I don't think so, but what would be the pretext of that?
[01:33:05.329 --> 01:33:23.096]  So, last Friday I saw news articles about a bill, an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, a big defense spending bill, introduced by Adam Schiff, and I just went off the articles, I didn't read the bill yet, saying, oh, they don't want the government to have oversight, they don't want Congress to have oversight, the President becomes a dictator, whoever the President is.
[01:33:24.096 --> 01:33:33.064]   And yeah, the courts won't have any effect either, and then I read the bill this weekend, And page three it says, and I'll show it to you, domestic extremism.
[01:33:33.084 --> 01:33:39.709]  And then it links to US code dealing with not just military personnel, but the American people and military tribunals.
[01:33:39.769 --> 01:33:44.053]  And then it lets the military rape people and not have due process.
[01:33:44.133 --> 01:33:45.914]  I mean, it is scary as hell.
[01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:49.198]  It's got Purge, the military information, you name it.
[01:33:49.558 --> 01:33:51.080]  So Pete Santilli is a former Marine.
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:52.902]  He was involved in Rec.
[01:33:52.922 --> 01:33:56.406]  84 in Gardens Plot and Cable Splicer and all the rest of it.
[01:33:56.947 --> 01:33:58.429]  And he's been a talk show host for a long time.
[01:33:58.449 --> 01:34:01.252]  He's done a great job analyzing the police state.
[01:34:01.292 --> 01:34:02.373]  Also been a political prisoner.
[01:34:02.674 --> 01:34:09.337]   He was released from jail for everything that happened with the Bundys in Oregon and obviously
[01:34:09.337 --> 01:34:15.577]   There in Nevada as well, and so I was talking to him last night this morning about the subsections
[01:34:15.577 --> 01:34:19.217]   I was going through him too, and you read one thing and the me is like oh
[01:34:19.217 --> 01:34:24.126]   They don't want congressional oversight about the military at January 6. That's only part of it, or they don't want
[01:34:24.126 --> 01:34:28.363]   oversight about No, it just gives them carte blanche.
[01:34:28.823 --> 01:34:29.804]  This is martial law.
[01:34:30.144 --> 01:34:37.429]  When they say the president is in charge of the military domestically with no congressional oversight, they're supposed to be congressional oversight if the president launches a war.
[01:34:37.749 --> 01:34:40.531]  Supposed to be a declaration of war, not an authorization of force.
[01:34:40.892 --> 01:34:44.234]  But now they're saying domestically, no debate, no discussion.
[01:34:44.714 --> 01:34:45.955]  That is martial law.
[01:34:46.275 --> 01:34:48.017]  That is taking the safety off on the gun.
[01:34:49.482 --> 01:34:50.062]  To our head.
[01:34:50.102 --> 01:34:51.823]  It's H.R.
[01:34:51.843 --> 01:34:55.165]  4350, an amendment that the Democratic Party leadership is pushing.
[01:34:55.545 --> 01:35:03.489]  And Pete Santilli in the next 45 minutes is going to go over all of this bombshell Marshall Law plan announced to install Biden as a dictator and use the U.S.
[01:35:03.509 --> 01:35:06.411]  military against Americans to suspend congressional oversight.
[01:35:06.831 --> 01:35:10.873]  And again, I get a lot of comments on Infowars that may not video saying, well, he's a puppet.
[01:35:12.014 --> 01:35:12.795]  Well, that's the whole point.
[01:35:13.075 --> 01:35:14.137]  It's not just Biden.
[01:35:14.277 --> 01:35:15.158]  It's any president.
[01:35:15.198 --> 01:35:18.943]  This will be law, and then the globalists will control that puppet.
[01:35:19.444 --> 01:35:20.565]  It'll probably be Gavin Newsom.
[01:35:20.585 --> 01:35:25.512]  So to lay it out in the next 45 minutes is Pete Santilli, talk show host in his own right.
[01:35:25.552 --> 01:35:26.774]  Pete, thanks for joining us.
[01:35:26.794 --> 01:35:27.595]  Let's roll through this.
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:31.102]  OK, Alex, I want to I want to back up.
[01:35:31.122 --> 01:35:32.523]  We're going to go back and forth here.
[01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:37.646]  First, let me give everybody an indication of like, why do I know about Rex 84?
[01:35:37.707 --> 01:35:39.788]  When I was in the military, I was in I was an air winger.
[01:35:39.808 --> 01:35:46.273]  I was in the air wing in that on the basically the aviation ordinance side.
[01:35:47.373 --> 01:36:06.820]  Of the military and I actually had an accident I had Undergone surgery they took away my air wings and I had a desk job and that desk job believe it or not Because I had clearance added TS clearance in the military and my job was to Take a manual Essentially develop a manual back in the day.
[01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:28.346]   We were typing computers were you know were used for communications back to Conus when I was overseas, but to develop a Our federal continuity plan coming from Rex 84 as to how we were to get our weapons from the flight line at our military bases to the magazines in the deep underground military bases.
[01:36:30.928 --> 01:36:31.889]  Why is this important?
[01:36:32.069 --> 01:36:36.893]  Because the federal continuity directive is how FEMA was born.
[01:36:36.914 --> 01:36:38.495]  I want everyone to remember.
[01:36:38.635 --> 01:36:39.516]  It's a COG 1979.
[01:36:39.856 --> 01:36:42.038]  This is when the deep state really starts taking over.
[01:36:43.143 --> 01:36:43.824]  Oh yeah.
[01:36:43.904 --> 01:36:50.128]  Now, if you recall, back then, hey, you know, we were in the Cold War.
[01:36:50.188 --> 01:36:51.750]  I'm a Cold War veteran.
[01:36:52.110 --> 01:37:01.817]  At the time, we were concerned about the potential for civil unrest and things like that if we had an economic breakdown because we watched, of course, Russia as they started to unravel.
[01:37:01.837 --> 01:37:04.760]  But here was the purpose of developing FEMA.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:12.886]  In the event, and actually, I'll never forget this because it was written into the precursor to why they were developing the Federal Continuity Directive.
[01:37:13.486 --> 01:37:15.548]  That we had national security vulnerabilities.
[01:37:16.429 --> 01:37:28.399]  Because of the fact that we came away from the gold standard, Kissinger went to Saudi Arabia and struck an agreement with them to buy up all of our debt and sell us cheap oil.
[01:37:28.759 --> 01:37:33.864]  And in exchange for that, we would agree not to tap into our natural reserves.
[01:37:34.104 --> 01:37:34.925]  This is a fact.
[01:37:35.145 --> 01:37:39.649]  It's in the Federal Continuity Directive as it was being developed.
[01:37:40.513 --> 01:37:46.636]  Back then, they essentially outlined what could happen with our supply chain disruptions immediately.
[01:37:46.696 --> 01:38:00.523]  For instance, if Saudi Arabia turned on us, as they basically gamed out, that very quickly, if we decoupled from the petrodollar, our supply chain disruptions, the banking system would shut down.
[01:38:00.864 --> 01:38:06.126]  Within a 72-hour period, we could have a situation where there's civil unrest.
[01:38:06.326 --> 01:38:09.168]  And now the Davos Group and Biden is doing that on purpose.
[01:38:11.042 --> 01:38:12.023]  Look at where we're at today.
[01:38:12.423 --> 01:38:24.550]  Everything that they had predicted as to why we needed to prepare as to continuity of government back then, it's called FCD1, is happening right here and now, today.
[01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:27.491]  And that's why those of us that have lived it or studied it know this.
[01:38:28.032 --> 01:38:31.654]  Our battle plans to protect ourselves are now being used against us word for word.
[01:38:32.799 --> 01:38:33.899]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:34.019 --> 01:38:36.040]  Now, let's fast forward.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:37.441]  I said we're going to go back and forth here.
[01:38:37.481 --> 01:38:38.881]  Let's fast forward to the other day.
[01:38:39.902 --> 01:38:44.484]  The documentary filmmaker, Christopher Emery, was on Owen Schroeder's show.
[01:38:45.064 --> 01:39:14.595]   And he had mentioned that he saw you and I getting together talking about, you know, the deep state and many, many other things as to the corruption, the experience that I had with learning about their operations, their entrapment operations, their Social Engineering and basically their Joint Terrorism Task Force missions and he said you know I wanted to come forward I need to reach out to Pete Santilli because I have you know I have information and knowledge as to what happened during Oklahoma City.
[01:39:16.825 --> 01:39:19.466]  Let me say to you that I'm a long-term listener.
[01:39:19.506 --> 01:39:20.106]  You already know this.
[01:39:20.446 --> 01:39:25.488]  For decades, for 20 plus years, I had come awake to a lot of things.
[01:39:25.628 --> 01:39:28.709]  One of which was, he introduced me to the movie, A Noble Lie.
[01:39:29.409 --> 01:39:33.030]  And in A Noble Lie, it was laid out.
[01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:35.951]  If you haven't seen it, everyone needs to go watch Noble Lie.
[01:39:35.971 --> 01:39:37.192]  That's your homework assignment.
[01:39:37.572 --> 01:39:39.772]  And understand exactly where we are today.
[01:39:40.092 --> 01:40:05.421]   Because the methodology that they employed during Oklahoma City They'll plant an attack on Governor Whitmer's house, they'll launch January 6th.
[01:40:05.461 --> 01:40:13.685]  They're running that playbook, but not just to get Bill Clinton reelected with an Oklahoma City bombing in 95, which he admitted got him reelected, but to bring in permanent martial law.
[01:40:15.199 --> 01:40:17.222]  That is exactly right.
[01:40:18.044 --> 01:40:26.278]  Now, with the Oklahoma City bombing, Chris Emery, when I started talking to him, just before you had rolled out what's outlined in 4350.
[01:40:27.876 --> 01:40:38.958]  He said, I have basically evidence that, not that Timothy McVeigh didn't perpetrate the act of blowing up the building, but he wasn't the only person that was involved.
[01:40:38.978 --> 01:40:54.301]  And there's plenty of forensic evidence and other evidence that government operators, some CIA, FBI, Southern Poverty Law Center as an FBI, they're an arm operating as media of the FBI.
[01:40:54.321 --> 01:40:56.401]  They're an intel gathering group.
[01:40:57.181 --> 01:41:04.708]  So, this is important as it relates to... Yeah, they're getting ready to run this play, but 50 times bigger right now, ahead of the midterms, with 113 days.
[01:41:05.529 --> 01:41:12.636]  And you can literally... Alex, as you were laying it out yesterday, I'm literally pulling 43.50 now.
[01:41:12.976 --> 01:41:20.303]  And I did a quick search and I wanted to see the extremist or extremism term.
[01:41:20.323 --> 01:41:21.304]  122 references.
[01:41:21.384 --> 01:41:30.069]   Essentially, they're setting the stage Implement this continuity of government directive.
[01:41:30.089 --> 01:41:37.917]  They're going to purge the military of extremists, and then they're going to weaponize the military, of course, to go get us extremists.
[01:41:37.937 --> 01:41:41.120]  Now, what's most important, and we'll talk about this on the other side of the break.
[01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:46.483]  I then went and tried to determine what their definition of extremism was.
[01:41:46.543 --> 01:41:47.903]  And guess where they redefined it?
[01:41:48.424 --> 01:41:50.765]  After, of course, January 6th.
[01:41:51.465 --> 01:41:59.810]  An extremist is essentially anybody that waves an American flag, a don't tread on me flag, sings the national anthem, so on and so forth.
[01:42:00.310 --> 01:42:02.171]  An extremist is an American is the enemy.
[01:42:02.211 --> 01:42:06.174]  It's a declaration of war against the American people and it makes Obama a dictator.
[01:42:06.834 --> 01:42:08.135]  So let's cut right to the chase.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.225]  Most governments fall with military coups throughout history.
[01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:14.408]  It's the norm, not the exception.
[01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:19.957]  And we've had a long train of attempts by the deep state executive to take over.
[01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:21.892]  We have a puppet president.
[01:42:22.572 --> 01:42:24.334]  We have them demonizing the American people.
[01:42:24.374 --> 01:42:37.003]  We have legislation introduced and added as pork barrel to the National Defense Authorization Act that they're trying to pass in the next few months to say the president is in control of the military domestically with no congressional oversight.
[01:42:37.603 --> 01:42:44.048]  They try to divert off into sexual harassment cases, stuff like that, but it says domestic military operations.
[01:42:44.268 --> 01:42:45.449]  Absolutely unprecedented.
[01:42:45.889 --> 01:42:56.253]   Singles out The right-wingers, the right-wing extremists, which as Pete Santelli said, investigative reporter, is everybody that resists this new world order.
[01:42:56.273 --> 01:42:58.436]  So let's start getting into HR 4350 and Adam Schiff.
[01:43:01.138 --> 01:43:05.744]  Okay, Adam Schiff, couple of elements related to Adam Schiff.
[01:43:05.784 --> 01:43:17.740]  If you start digging into the implications of what Schiff called for, essentially if you look into it, they're going to prohibit, and we're going to have to relate back to the November 2020 election.
[01:43:18.841 --> 01:43:39.685]  If anyone in the military, in cyber security, internal whistleblowers, to any of their crimes behind the scenes, if they provide evidence, gather evidence, that if it's done without permission of the military, that that evidence cannot be used in a court of law.
[01:43:39.965 --> 01:43:52.068]   Essentially relating back specifically to the possibility that there were whistleblowers internally that indicated that there was A military and intel operation going on in the November 2020 election.
[01:43:52.308 --> 01:43:56.350]  So they're trying to prohibit any potential whistleblowers internally.
[01:43:57.071 --> 01:43:58.451]  How are they trying to disconnect us?
[01:43:58.491 --> 01:44:01.773]  There's a two-fold effort here in this 4350.
[01:44:02.493 --> 01:44:12.738]   Not only do they want to purge the military of extremists, they want to disconnect Of course, anyone in the military, from anything having to do with the American public.
[01:44:12.778 --> 01:44:32.164]  For instance, if you click on, and it specifically references extremism, for instance, if you click on a Don't Tread on Me flag, or any article that is favorable to the extremist agenda, you're therefore considered an extremist and could be either disciplined or discharged.
[01:44:32.284 --> 01:44:46.758]  And this is in the legislation, not just to make the President a dictator, the office of the President beyond Biden, not just to not have oversight, but they specifically say, when you're reading it, that we're going after the extremists and the military's preparing for a war with the people.
[01:44:46.818 --> 01:44:48.039]  I mean, it's totally criminal.
[01:44:48.300 --> 01:44:49.421]  It's an indictment of them.
[01:44:49.821 --> 01:44:51.443]  Why are they so desperate to do this?
[01:44:52.646 --> 01:45:00.671]  Uh, because their operations that they run over and over again, and we cannot deny the fact that these are globalists that have been trying for many, many years.
[01:45:00.711 --> 01:45:07.256]  They've set this stage for decades now to set up their one world government, this globalist agenda with the UN.
[01:45:07.576 --> 01:45:20.925]  They have the ability right now, if they were to give Joe Biden or any other president the power through this 4350 to indefinitely detain enemy combatants or extremists without due process.
[01:45:22.466 --> 01:45:27.029]  And by the way, Pete, you and I are both trying to stop violence.
[01:45:27.089 --> 01:45:29.371]  We're winning culturally, spiritually, financially.
[01:45:29.391 --> 01:45:30.631]  The world's waking up.
[01:45:30.812 --> 01:45:32.693]  The globalists even admit that.
[01:45:32.773 --> 01:45:34.773]  getting their political opponents.
[01:45:34.773 --> 01:45:36.773]   And by the way Pete, you and I are both trying to stop violence.
[01:45:36.773 --> 01:45:39.773]  We're winning culturally, spiritually, financially.
[01:45:39.773 --> 01:45:40.773]  The world's waking up.
[01:45:40.773 --> 01:45:42.773]  The globalists even admit that.
[01:45:42.773 --> 01:45:46.773]  But think about the FBI and the CIA and the military.
[01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.773]  They're not stupid.
[01:45:47.944 --> 01:45:53.470]  Ordering the military out to try something like this would destroy the military and cause a total civil war.
[01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:55.272]  They couldn't hold Afghanistan.
[01:45:55.853 --> 01:45:58.295]  The Evaldi police couldn't go in and confront one shooter.
[01:45:58.856 --> 01:46:05.764]  So the way they're set up, they will get destroyed, which I can see is the Klaus Schwab plan to try to bring this country down.
[01:46:05.924 --> 01:46:06.725]  How do we stop this?
[01:46:07.654 --> 01:46:13.581]  Well, first of all, we need to expose them for who they are, and the documentation is there.
[01:46:13.601 --> 01:46:14.542]  I mean, A.G.
[01:46:14.603 --> 01:46:27.118]  Garland, right now, he was put in place as the Attorney General, having a lot of experience as to how to cover up this operation that we know... He helped run Oklahoma City, and he was involved in Fast and Furious.
[01:46:28.081 --> 01:46:31.824]  And he's directly involved in covering up the evidence on January 6th.
[01:46:31.904 --> 01:46:48.515]  I have whistleblowers right now that are begging to come forward in the legal system to tell in the court of law that they have facial recognition of friendlies or federal government operators that were the majority of the people at the frontline breach.
[01:46:48.795 --> 01:46:49.956]  They want to come forward.
[01:46:52.279 --> 01:46:57.268]  You've been really a great sleuth on this and you've been communicating with the Republican lawyers, the Trump lawyers.
[01:46:57.708 --> 01:46:58.590]  This is all out there.
[01:46:58.610 --> 01:46:59.993]  Tucker Carlson started to cover it.
[01:47:01.429 --> 01:47:01.970]  Absolutely.
[01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:07.195]  We have the ability here in a court of law to expose this through the Bundy Ranch Trials.
[01:47:07.215 --> 01:47:12.940]  So that's why they don't want any jurisdiction in civilian courts of military operations domestically.
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.962]  A lot of this is to cover their ass.
[01:47:15.282 --> 01:47:17.144]  They're already running military operations illegally.
[01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.565]  They're already having a partisan military.
[01:47:18.966 --> 01:47:21.708]  But it looks like Congressman and Senator Grassley are right.
[01:47:22.069 --> 01:47:29.427]   They're saying this is a cover-up of Milley, who admitted to CNN for a month he was really president and overrode Trump.
[01:47:29.767 --> 01:47:31.407]  I mean, he said that publicly.
[01:47:31.447 --> 01:47:32.088]  It's not debatable.
[01:47:33.368 --> 01:47:34.088]  That's exactly right.
[01:47:34.108 --> 01:47:34.909]  Now, imagine this.
[01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:41.451]  They have a history of entrapping Americans, of creating terrorist events.
[01:47:41.951 --> 01:47:43.812]  We can name them for an hour.
[01:47:44.092 --> 01:47:45.372]  They have a history of all that.
[01:47:45.813 --> 01:47:58.716]   If they can bring that, a true 4350, And giving the President the ultimate powers and the military, of course, the ultimate powers to surveil any potential extremists.
[01:47:58.896 --> 01:48:15.399]  As a matter of fact, buried in there, Alex, you may not even know it, outside of Section 529, they've given the GAO, the General Accounting Office, the authority to do and the Treasury to do background researches as to how quote-unquote extremists are funded.
[01:48:16.399 --> 01:48:18.941]  Extremists is basically how they've defined it.
[01:48:19.701 --> 01:48:31.108]  In December of 2021, there was a document that was titled, I have it here, Report on Countering Extremist Activity within the Department of Defense.
[01:48:31.389 --> 01:48:39.594]  Yeah, that was put out in June where they listed the American people as terrorists and the FBI followed suit a month later saying their main mission is fighting right-wing terrorists.
[01:48:39.894 --> 01:48:44.737]  The definition, questioning elections, questioning lockdowns or forced inoculations or open borders.
[01:48:45.954 --> 01:48:48.157]  This is the MIAC report on steroids.
[01:48:48.237 --> 01:48:54.465]  I'm going to read an example of what they define as an extremist on page 11.
[01:48:54.625 --> 01:48:56.465]  you can go right to it.
[01:48:56.465 --> 01:49:01.824]   Knowingly displaying paraphernalia, words or symbols in support of extremist activities.
[01:49:01.824 --> 01:49:05.144]  Knowingly, what is it?
[01:49:05.137 --> 01:49:09.520]  Oh, tattoos, bumper stickers, whether on or off military installations.
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:19.368]  Well, 4350 gives the GAO and the intel services the ability to surveil anybody outside of the military that is a potential extremist.
[01:49:19.628 --> 01:49:24.412]  And then, of course, database them for Roundup as enemy combatants.
[01:49:24.432 --> 01:49:26.594]  Now, what are they ultimately headed towards, these globalists?
[01:49:27.174 --> 01:49:28.454]  Alex, I'm going to tell you something right now.
[01:49:28.514 --> 01:49:29.415]  I have it documented.
[01:49:29.435 --> 01:49:31.415]  It was buried in the Clinton archives.
[01:49:31.454 --> 01:49:37.494]   Bill Clinton set the stage after they formed the Federal Continuity Directive that in the
[01:49:37.494 --> 01:49:41.515]   event of civil unrest or the scenario that we talk about where the military is having
[01:49:41.515 --> 01:49:48.875]   to come in and gun confiscate, that that would provide for them to turn over our sovereignty
[01:49:48.875 --> 01:49:55.755]   to the United Nations peacekeeping forces because of the global instability that would
[01:49:55.755 --> 01:49:59.375]   be created by- >> And Pete, I made police state films at the time, it was
[01:49:59.375 --> 01:50:03.954]   so unsophisticated, I didn't know I was being given leaks from the military against what
[01:50:03.954 --> 01:50:08.173]   Clinton was doing and then I was bitching at the military and finally they came and
[01:50:08.173 --> 01:50:12.694]   visited me, not once but twice at Jones, we're the ones that gave you that, we're against
[01:50:12.694 --> 01:50:13.875]  this, grow up.
[01:50:13.875 --> 01:50:17.274]  And I was like, 28 years old, so I didn't understand it all.
[01:50:17.274 --> 01:50:19.954]  But absolutely, that's what's been going on here.
[01:50:19.954 --> 01:50:23.993]   So the military's not our enemy, it's the globalists taking control of our military
[01:50:23.993 --> 01:50:26.033]  trying to do this right now.
[01:50:26.033 --> 01:50:27.033]  We'll come back.
[01:50:27.033 --> 01:50:30.673]   All right, Pete Santilli worked in COG in the Marine Corps.
[01:50:30.673 --> 01:50:34.475]   I'm a leading expert on this and he probably knows more than I do.
[01:50:34.475 --> 01:50:36.434]  I don't put BSers on this show.
[01:50:36.977 --> 01:50:45.282]  So the next two segments, I'm going to try to just turn my mic off and let him talk about this, but he's just like I am, and it's good, but it's also bad.
[01:50:45.302 --> 01:50:48.404]  Because the general audience is smart, but they're hearing all this.
[01:50:48.424 --> 01:50:52.966]  They're like, what is this about Rex 84 and Barton Splicer and COG and FEMA?
[01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:56.969]  Cutting to where they are now, they're actually activating all this.
[01:50:57.449 --> 01:50:58.750]  How do we stop it?
[01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:00.791]  How do you think they'll try to trigger it?
[01:51:01.631 --> 01:51:02.332]  You've gone over it.
[01:51:02.412 --> 01:51:03.092]  I've gone over it.
[01:51:03.372 --> 01:51:13.436]   I've never seen such naked admissions of I mean, just the president will have power over the military, no more congressional control, that's the end of posse commentatas.
[01:51:13.957 --> 01:51:15.557]  My listeners, I love them.
[01:51:15.917 --> 01:51:17.597]  They're like, this can't be real, he's an idiot.
[01:51:17.837 --> 01:51:19.158]  It's not him, it's the president.
[01:51:19.338 --> 01:51:21.418]  Whoever they put in, Gavin Newsom, you name it.
[01:51:21.838 --> 01:51:24.539]  This is dumb, this is a total indictment of them.
[01:51:24.559 --> 01:51:30.900]  And I know it's insane, but it's happening because they know they stole the election, they know there's a political realignment, they know they're in trouble.
[01:51:30.940 --> 01:51:33.501]  So let's talk about more of what this legislation does.
[01:51:34.221 --> 01:51:41.609]  What they may do to trigger it and actually get it into place and how we stop that with legislatures, governors, members of Congress, because they're eating around the edges.
[01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:43.951]  Like, hey, Milley said he was the president?
[01:51:44.272 --> 01:51:45.793]  That's a military dictatorship.
[01:51:45.813 --> 01:51:47.615]  Well, that's because they didn't control Trump.
[01:51:48.316 --> 01:51:51.860]  Well, then now they want to control the president with a new president, with the current president.
[01:51:52.140 --> 01:51:53.662]  Explain this to them, Pete Santelli.
[01:51:54.884 --> 01:52:05.770]  You know, I'm definitely going to explain in the following fashion that for decades they've set up the legal framework by which they can get us to where they are right now.
[01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:09.892]  This effort by the globalists to surrender our sovereignty.
[01:52:09.912 --> 01:52:11.353]  This has been their goal the whole time.
[01:52:11.373 --> 01:52:15.755]  And the fact that they didn't get there, and we've been warning of it, means we've been fighting them and stopping them.
[01:52:15.915 --> 01:52:17.316]  People are like, well, we've been hearing about this forever.
[01:52:17.336 --> 01:52:18.377]  Yeah, now it's here.
[01:52:18.617 --> 01:52:19.197]  That's my point.
[01:52:19.257 --> 01:52:19.938]  I'm sorry I'm ranting.
[01:52:19.958 --> 01:52:20.218]  Go ahead.
[01:52:20.948 --> 01:52:21.689]  Sure, that's okay.
[01:52:22.090 --> 01:52:30.723]  But there's been this incremental process by which, and these people that are right now, we see Merrick Garland, he has mastered the fine art.
[01:52:31.003 --> 01:52:36.722]   And by the way, I could literally say that in a court of law, we could have him prosecuted
[01:52:36.722 --> 01:52:40.523]   for his involvement in the cover up of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:52:40.523 --> 01:52:45.884]   There's plenty of evidence that is contained in those archives that shows that Merrick
[01:52:45.884 --> 01:52:51.243]   Garland covered up all the details, not necessarily exonerating McVeigh.
[01:52:51.243 --> 01:52:55.842]   That's not what we're looking to do because those guys, of course, the evil extremists
[01:52:55.842 --> 01:53:00.804]   that wanna go perpetrate bombings and things like that, we want them to be held accountable.
[01:53:00.804 --> 01:53:07.363]   The main thing I wanna go after and highlight in today's episode is that these intel agencies,
[01:53:07.363 --> 01:53:13.403]   as in the FBI, their partners in the intel services, as in the SPLC.
[01:53:13.527 --> 01:53:18.613]  Okay, this is important that SPLC... They are usurping Congress's power of the purse and oversight.
[01:53:18.893 --> 01:53:20.275]  This is a deep state coup.
[01:53:21.397 --> 01:53:23.097]  It is a deep state coup.
[01:53:23.337 --> 01:53:37.081]  They've written it right into 4350, giving the quote-unquote, and it's coded, most of these, I call them chimpanzees, that sign off on 3,200-page bills that they didn't read.
[01:53:37.101 --> 01:53:38.901]  Those are elected officials.
[01:53:39.181 --> 01:53:47.843]  They have no idea the work that you've done, Alex, the work that I've done in a relatively short period of time to research.
[01:53:49.143 --> 01:53:51.304]  This bill and what the full implications are.
[01:53:51.684 --> 01:53:53.785]  Biden essentially is set up right now.
[01:53:53.825 --> 01:53:58.807]  Look, I'm going to put on the screen right now PDD 25, okay?
[01:53:59.447 --> 01:54:30.418]   Will allow, by them redefining extremists, of course, it will allow them PDD-25 will give Joe Biden the opportunity to pick up the phone during civil unrest and say we've got a A civil unrest concern, you know, a concern of international importance, of course, and call in UN peacekeepers and thereby surrendering and having our military even be subservient to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force.
[01:54:30.838 --> 01:54:33.759]  What does it say in PDD on page 26?
[01:54:33.959 --> 01:54:47.362]  It says that such operations and actions under the UN Chapter 7 do not require the consent of the state involved or the parties to the conflict.
[01:54:47.402 --> 01:54:48.022]  What does that mean?
[01:54:48.342 --> 01:54:59.211]   He can go right around Congress They can bypass all authorities, even within the military, and take us to a UN peacekeeping authority above and beyond everything.
[01:54:59.231 --> 01:55:01.193]  Now, why is January 6th important?
[01:55:02.455 --> 01:55:11.163]   Well, because January 6th was used for them to set the pretext to redefine, of course, What an extremist is.
[01:55:11.183 --> 01:55:23.329]   They published a report in December of 2021 calling basically half of Americans, if you wave a flag or support President Trump, You are an extremist!
[01:55:23.469 --> 01:55:26.310]  Well now, we know that they have been involved.
[01:55:26.370 --> 01:55:27.150]  It is documented.
[01:55:27.170 --> 01:55:28.131]  It's not a conspiracy.
[01:55:28.151 --> 01:55:31.452]  There is from World Trade Center.
[01:55:32.272 --> 01:55:42.155]  The first bombing in 1993, they allowed their FBI operatives, allowed explosives to make it to the World Trade Center.
[01:55:42.375 --> 01:55:44.375]  And that was done by the FBI.
[01:55:44.415 --> 01:55:45.536]  They helped facilitate that.
[01:55:45.796 --> 01:55:50.157]  Some of the training was done by Department of Interior federal agents.
[01:55:51.377 --> 01:56:06.190]   So they know how to bring these extremists to the point to where they're going to cause the chaos and the civil unrest and the pretext by which they're going to Pick up the phone and call the UN and call them in.
[01:56:06.230 --> 01:56:07.491]  That's what the ultimate goal is.
[01:56:07.871 --> 01:56:10.572]  It is very, very well documented.
[01:56:10.592 --> 01:56:19.377]  The continuity of government directive also includes, and we've already seen them experimenting with it, with the release of the China virus out of the Wuhan lab.
[01:56:19.597 --> 01:56:24.019]  They've already tested continuity of government procedures and communications.
[01:56:24.919 --> 01:56:36.925]   There was a point in time where we took our Northern Command, the top communications officials within the military were bunkered up and isolated
[01:56:36.925 --> 01:56:41.876]   and quarantined in Cheyenne Mountain. They've already practiced this continuity of
[01:56:41.876 --> 01:56:46.746]   government communication system just with the release of the Wuhan lab. They said that they
[01:56:46.746 --> 01:56:48.265]  didn't want to expose them.
[01:56:48.265 --> 01:56:54.025]   They're still continuously rotating those military officials in and out of Cheyenne.
[01:56:54.025 --> 01:56:58.985]   So everything that they've been doing now for decades, setting up the legal pretext,
[01:56:58.985 --> 01:57:04.826]   of course, experimenting with how to perpetrate these, not necessarily, I say a false flag.
[01:57:04.826 --> 01:57:10.985]   They're absolutely, well, they're happening. They're false flags. But the perpetrators of
[01:57:10.985 --> 01:57:17.225]   these government-operated hits upon America to demonize us, of course,
[01:57:17.225 --> 01:57:22.185]  like with the Oklahoma City bombing and Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[01:57:22.452 --> 01:57:30.378]  Is to get us to the point to where we're on our knees asking them for a solution.
[01:57:30.738 --> 01:57:35.982]  Continuity of government requires that we go to them for food if you're not prepared.
[01:57:36.402 --> 01:57:40.605]  There's a level of preparedness that you must maintain so it's not... That's it, Pete.
[01:57:40.625 --> 01:57:43.807]  What you're getting at is, COVID was just the training goals for this.
[01:57:44.407 --> 01:57:45.648]  Canada's under martial law.
[01:57:45.728 --> 01:57:47.069]  Much of Europe's under martial law.
[01:57:47.469 --> 01:57:50.485]   Places like Australia are under it.
[01:57:50.585 --> 01:57:51.785]  This is all globalist run.
[01:57:51.805 --> 01:58:00.147]  They admit it and for the first time ever they've got legislation to make the president a dictator over the military domestically and they say the enemy is us.
[01:58:00.227 --> 01:58:10.429]  I mean this is just no other document ever even compares to this in the climate of global collapse and the climate of stolen elections and the climate of the midterms and all of this.
[01:58:10.469 --> 01:58:13.849]  That's what political parties do when they're out of power and want to stay in power.
[01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:16.050]  What's happened in thousands of countries.
[01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:18.359]   You know there's hundreds of countries what's happened over and over again what's
[01:58:18.359 --> 01:58:23.719]   happened thousands of times in history is now happening to us it's textbook.
[01:58:23.719 --> 01:58:26.889]  Absolutely textbook.
[01:58:25.521 --> 01:58:26.721]  They're already planning.
[01:58:26.741 --> 01:58:28.402]  They already have their people in place.
[01:58:28.642 --> 01:58:28.942]  A.G.
[01:58:28.982 --> 01:58:29.442]  Garland.
[01:58:30.003 --> 01:58:37.186]  And I'm also going to say that Bill Barr is also, as a former CIA agent, he's worked for the CIA.
[01:58:37.226 --> 01:58:37.786]  Go look it up.
[01:58:38.046 --> 01:58:39.146]  Enlist their Wikipedia.
[01:58:39.427 --> 01:58:41.287]  Wikipedia on Bill Barr is wrong.
[01:58:41.507 --> 01:58:43.368]  He was with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[01:58:43.688 --> 01:58:47.850]  Started out there through the Bush several administrations.
[01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:57.281]   His most recent post Prior to becoming Attorney General, was in fact Kirkland and Ellis, the world's largest law firm.
[01:58:57.641 --> 01:58:58.661]  What was he doing there?
[01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:07.443]  Well, Kirkland and Ellis was actually responsible for the merger with Dominion Voting Systems and State Street Capital.
[01:59:07.843 --> 01:59:09.223]  He had a conflict of interest.
[01:59:09.243 --> 01:59:13.584]  He should have recused himself having anything to do with Dominion Voting Systems.
[01:59:13.784 --> 01:59:16.805]  We'll come back and get more of the documents from Pete Santilli, but here's the bottom line.
[01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.266]  You talk about the facts all day, what they did, what they didn't do.
[01:59:20.807 --> 01:59:23.449]  The point is, they're openly saying there's going to be a civil war.
[01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:25.711]  They're openly saying they want war on the American people.
[01:59:25.731 --> 01:59:29.015]  They're openly saying that right-wingers are about to engage in all this terrorism.
[01:59:29.995 --> 01:59:34.560]  And now they're saying the president's going to be a dictator and can run military operations domestically against us.
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:42.707]  What do we do with the governors, the legislatures, good people in Congress, the media, to raise the alarm and point out what's happening?
[01:59:43.479 --> 01:59:47.921]  Because they're already admitting in Congress, oh, under this, Milley was a dictator for a month.
[01:59:48.101 --> 01:59:48.881]  Exactly!
[01:59:49.342 --> 01:59:50.422]  But they don't need a dictator.
[01:59:50.482 --> 01:59:53.223]  If the president's their puppet, they'll make him the dictator.
[01:59:53.263 --> 01:59:55.364]  So this isn't speculation, folks.
[01:59:55.404 --> 01:59:56.244]  This is happening.
[01:59:56.525 --> 01:59:59.186]  The question is, how are they going to launch it?
[01:59:59.206 --> 02:00:00.786]  There's 350 million people in this country.
[02:00:01.987 --> 02:00:05.088]  And statistically, mass shootings only kill a few hundred people a year.
[02:00:05.729 --> 02:00:06.329]  Still too many.
[02:00:07.765 --> 02:00:14.567]  But NBC is reporting, as well as the Indianapolis Star, four dead, including suspects after a Greenwood Mall shooting in Indiana.
[02:00:15.987 --> 02:00:21.889]  A lone gunman with a long gun killed three people before an armed bystander killed him in the Greenwood Park Mall.
[02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:26.090]  And they don't want that information known or understood.
[02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:29.091]  That's just more of the information we should be covering.
[02:00:29.131 --> 02:00:34.027]   But listen, when I say Pete Santilli is a lot like me, He has all this knowledge.
[02:00:34.067 --> 02:00:36.451]  He wants to show you all the facts and back up what he's saying.
[02:00:36.972 --> 02:00:43.881]  It's a long history of this, but on a scale of 1 to 10, the police state announcements being made right now are an 11.
[02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:49.481]  So everything the deep states wanted to do, they're now getting through.
[02:00:49.561 --> 02:00:51.762]  So forget how they might implement it.
[02:00:52.563 --> 02:00:58.667]  It's unconstitutional to say the president is over the military domestically with no congressional authorization.
[02:00:58.967 --> 02:01:02.810]  They've got to have congressional authorization in the Constitution for any military operations.
[02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:08.855]  So them doing that is trying to let the deep state control the military to do whatever it wants, a blank check.
[02:01:08.975 --> 02:01:10.296]  We have a little bit of that.
[02:01:11.394 --> 02:01:17.519]  With the 1947 National Security Act, creating the CIA, saying no oversight except the Senate.
[02:01:17.779 --> 02:01:22.363]  Well, then they start spying on the Senate and, you know, the tail wags the dog.
[02:01:22.383 --> 02:01:26.987]  So that's really what this is, is the full bureaucracy being above the law.
[02:01:27.267 --> 02:01:37.469]   But then with the Express Mission, Adam Schiff says of war against the American people, it's just The Moby Dick of Wales.
[02:01:37.609 --> 02:01:45.414]  I mean, it is so over the top, when I read the bill, that I just, I haven't been able to sleep over it.
[02:01:45.454 --> 02:01:51.057]  I mean, you can see all the preparation, the global collapse, saying there's going to be domestic terror, all the provocative operations.
[02:01:51.437 --> 02:01:52.197]  It's all building ahead.
[02:01:52.217 --> 02:01:53.778]  So, Pete, let me ask you this.
[02:01:53.798 --> 02:01:56.220]  A leading investigative journalist has been covering this for a long time.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:58.341]  How do you think we stop this?
[02:01:58.381 --> 02:01:59.342]  We're covering it here.
[02:02:00.042 --> 02:02:01.303]  Listeners need to get upset about it.
[02:02:02.003 --> 02:02:03.885]  We need to share the articles and videos we're putting out.
[02:02:04.526 --> 02:02:06.127]  But don't we need Congress to take action?
[02:02:06.147 --> 02:02:06.528]  Governors?
[02:02:06.568 --> 02:02:07.128]  Legislatures?
[02:02:07.549 --> 02:02:16.939]  What are the processes that our borders totally collapsed, total lawlessness, millions coming across every few months, but they're saying the main threat is people that question election fraud.
[02:02:17.239 --> 02:02:21.283]  That tells me they're getting ready to steal the next election in the midterms in 113 days.
[02:02:21.623 --> 02:02:24.046]  How do you see them triggering something and how do we counter them?
[02:02:25.532 --> 02:02:33.595]  Well, I mean, all of the things that would lead to the ability for Joe Biden to pick up the phone or President Trump to even pick up the phone and call for U.N.
[02:02:33.635 --> 02:02:34.655]  peacekeeping troops.
[02:02:34.675 --> 02:02:36.376]  I don't think President Trump would do that.
[02:02:36.756 --> 02:02:37.396]  Explain again.
[02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:39.617]  That's in the executive orders and on the books.
[02:02:40.751 --> 02:02:42.112]  Yeah, I mean, it's right there.
[02:02:42.352 --> 02:02:47.034]  PDD 25 is buried in Clinton's archive.
[02:02:47.075 --> 02:02:49.236]  I mean, it is there with the UN.
[02:02:49.256 --> 02:02:52.157]  The nation state doesn't even need to provide consent.
[02:02:52.197 --> 02:02:53.678]  He can just do it with a telephone call.
[02:02:53.918 --> 02:02:56.860]  Well, what would cause that scenario?
[02:02:56.940 --> 02:02:57.960]  Civil unrest, civil war?
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.741]  My listeners will be, well, that's Bill Clinton.
[02:02:59.801 --> 02:03:01.542]  No, it's all on the books.
[02:03:02.163 --> 02:03:06.685]  Just because Biden might leave in a month or two years, it's law till it's repealed.
[02:03:06.785 --> 02:03:07.746]  It's on the books.
[02:03:08.630 --> 02:03:22.187]  It's all on the books, and 4350 itself is unconstitutional by declaring, essentially, by their definition of extremism, it's called half of America, or the political opponents of the current regime that's in place.
[02:03:22.547 --> 02:03:25.591]  That right there is insightful and provocative.
[02:03:26.532 --> 02:03:32.559]  I do need to say something.
[02:03:32.579 --> 02:03:42.650]  I need to make sure that I nail this, by the way, because I don't want anyone coming after you because you had me on to talk about Dominion voting system.
[02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:51.292]  This is a fact, and our nation's highest level attorneys that are looking into this told me, don't worry about Merrick Garland either.
[02:03:51.332 --> 02:03:53.793]  You need to worry about also AG Barr.
[02:03:54.173 --> 02:04:03.756]  It is in the public domain that AG Barr, right before he assumed the position, what he didn't do was disclose whether or not he had a conflict of interest.
[02:04:04.076 --> 02:04:15.544]   Because every single attorney that's hearing our voices, they know that before he gave testimony, before the January 6th committee, In opposition to President Trump, that he should have disclosed that.
[02:04:15.564 --> 02:04:18.506]  So that's kind of egregious in legal circles.
[02:04:18.566 --> 02:04:24.832]  But these are facts, and Dominique can't... I know, but I know you want to go after Barr and McCarland and all their minions.
[02:04:25.332 --> 02:04:27.434]  Big picture, let me ask you.
[02:04:27.454 --> 02:04:28.955]  I want your view on this.
[02:04:29.656 --> 02:04:31.938]  How do you think they trigger the martial law takeover?
[02:04:32.538 --> 02:04:33.179]  How do we stop it?
[02:04:34.338 --> 02:04:37.721]  You know, Alex, I keep hesitating.
[02:04:37.781 --> 02:04:39.562]  I keep avoiding answering that question.
[02:04:39.602 --> 02:04:40.063]  You know why?
[02:04:40.103 --> 02:04:55.375]  Because if I were to tell your viewers right now that they need to pick up the phone and call their senators and call their congressmen and women, those are the people that were seated with the machine that we know is election fraud for many, many decades.
[02:04:55.475 --> 02:05:01.000]   These people were put in place, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, We need to purge the system.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.081]  You know what we need to do?
[02:05:02.121 --> 02:05:08.527]  We need to flesh out the ones that are going to stand up in opposition to this 4350.
[02:05:09.208 --> 02:05:11.730]  You know, Marjorie Taylor Greene, she'll do it.
[02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:18.637]  I know she's going to be totally oppositional to this, especially the way they identify and target extremists.
[02:05:18.898 --> 02:05:22.241]  How many Americans right now have somebody who is serving in the military?
[02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:26.721]  All families have someone, somehow, someway.
[02:05:26.922 --> 02:05:30.663]  What, we're not to communicate with them because you might be waving an American flag?
[02:05:31.003 --> 02:05:38.927]  This is absolutely awful how they're dividing us and separating our military from having any communication with the general public.
[02:05:38.947 --> 02:05:39.667]  Here's another thing.
[02:05:39.928 --> 02:05:43.009]  They've also incorporated red flag laws.
[02:05:43.049 --> 02:05:45.890]  There's a fight out in the public for that, but guess what?
[02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:48.532]  That's right, there's red flag laws in this legislation, H.R.
[02:05:48.552 --> 02:05:48.532]  4350.
[02:05:48.632 --> 02:05:51.433]  I mean, that's what I'm saying, it's insanely evil.
[02:05:51.971 --> 02:06:04.965]  They're sneaking that in, they're giving the intel services and the General Accounting Office is authorized, surveilling Americans to determine how extremist organizations are funded.
[02:06:05.346 --> 02:06:15.100]   And I'm going to say this, and it's not just to plug InfoWars, we have We have to keep independent media open and alive.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:22.405]  We have to be able to do subsequent visits between you and I to expose what Jesse Trent to do told me six weeks ago.
[02:06:22.905 --> 02:06:24.266]  I can't talk about it right now.
[02:06:24.326 --> 02:06:25.327]  I'm under a gag order.
[02:06:25.687 --> 02:06:26.327]  Pat Con.
[02:06:26.648 --> 02:06:28.469]  We need to inform the public.
[02:06:29.860 --> 02:06:32.081]  Of what Operation PatCon is.
[02:06:32.361 --> 02:06:44.706]  It's an FBI operation where they were setting up their own white nationalist extremists, you know, KKK organizations, in order to, quote-unquote, under the pretext of investigating others.
[02:06:45.026 --> 02:06:46.647]  But they were breaking the law.
[02:06:46.707 --> 02:06:49.748]  We saw what they did in Michigan.
[02:06:50.588 --> 02:06:51.348]  They're lawbreakers.
[02:06:51.449 --> 02:06:57.852]   In my case up in Oregon, a Portland leftist jury Bottom line, Pete Santilli, this shows they're desperate.
[02:06:57.672 --> 02:06:59.372]  they acquitted them.
[02:06:59.372 --> 02:07:00.212]  Why?
[02:07:00.212 --> 02:07:03.011]   Because the only people that broke the law were the FBI agents.
[02:07:03.011 --> 02:07:07.072]   We need true reform within the Federal Bureau of Investigations.
[02:07:07.072 --> 02:07:13.191]   We've got a long history, over and over again, of many false flag operations
[02:07:13.191 --> 02:07:15.912]  where the FBI has literally participated.
[02:07:15.912 --> 02:07:18.472]   Bottom line, Pete Santilli, this shows they're desperate.
[02:07:18.472 --> 02:07:20.992]  How do people find your research and your show?
[02:07:20.992 --> 02:07:25.232]  You can go to thepetesantilliishow.com.
[02:07:25.187 --> 02:07:29.150]  PeteLive.tv is my website where you can tune into our live stream.
[02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:31.492]  And Alex, I want to overemphasize this point.
[02:07:31.512 --> 02:07:32.392]  Let me show this to you.
[02:07:32.532 --> 02:07:33.293]  I have this right here.
[02:07:33.633 --> 02:07:34.454]  I wanted to hold this up.
[02:07:34.834 --> 02:07:36.775]  Everyone needs to go buy one of these.
[02:07:37.195 --> 02:07:38.156]  Go buy a t-shirt.
[02:07:39.177 --> 02:07:39.337]  Right?
[02:07:40.171 --> 02:07:41.973]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:07:42.433 --> 02:07:44.995]  Alex Jones was right for many decades.
[02:07:45.055 --> 02:07:45.896]  Here's your homework.
[02:07:46.336 --> 02:07:48.838]  Go watch A Noble Lie.
[02:07:49.198 --> 02:07:50.479]  Go watch A Noble Lie.
[02:07:50.599 --> 02:07:51.400]  Get educated.
[02:07:51.500 --> 02:07:53.902]  Alex Jones introduced me to that documentary.
[02:07:54.202 --> 02:08:04.710]  And let's keep Infowars open, flourishing, so that we can deliver the truth to the American people and even our elected officials that have no clue what is in a 3200.
[02:08:04.750 --> 02:08:08.133]   Do you think any of them Read the bill, Alex Jones.
[02:08:08.153 --> 02:08:09.994]  Oh, and they passed the last spending bill in two hours.
[02:08:10.054 --> 02:08:11.015]  Thank you, Pete Santelli.
[02:08:11.435 --> 02:08:12.356]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:08:12.376 --> 02:08:13.197]  Powerful information.

[02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:19.981]  Films are so important.

[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:21.960]  The days all just blend together.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:25.141]  I work seven days a week in this fight because history is so critical right now.
[02:10:25.181 --> 02:10:27.242]  But we will continue on The War Room at 3 p.m.
[02:10:27.262 --> 02:10:31.904]  today and with American Journal with Harrison Smith knocking it out of the park, 8 a.m.
[02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:32.324]  weekdays.
[02:10:33.004 --> 02:10:40.048]  To be hitting HR 4350 to make the presidency of dictatorship for domestic military operations against the American people.
[02:10:40.529 --> 02:10:42.350]  We will continue to hammer HR 4350.
[02:10:42.670 --> 02:10:44.551]  That's our job.
[02:10:44.591 --> 02:10:48.734]  I don't know why so many times it's us that find the threat and you the audience that spreads the word.
[02:10:49.174 --> 02:10:57.679]  It scares me that nine times out of ten we are the detonator, the progenitors, the fire starters, the people that kick it all off.
[02:10:58.239 --> 02:10:59.220]  I don't want to be in that position.
[02:11:00.649 --> 02:11:04.332]  Every time I want to just ease back and not fight as hard because you know other people's jobs.
[02:11:04.672 --> 02:11:05.533]  I've been doing this 28 years.
[02:11:05.573 --> 02:11:08.155]  I realize it's our job to be the winners.
[02:11:08.415 --> 02:11:09.976]  We've been given Promethean fire.
[02:11:10.096 --> 02:11:13.219]  It's all to the glory of God, but we cannot do without your word of mouth.
[02:11:13.279 --> 02:11:15.420]  So take the archives of Sunday show.
[02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:16.201]  I did a great job.
[02:11:16.241 --> 02:11:17.502]  I think breaking it down.
[02:11:17.522 --> 02:11:18.783]  There's an at first hour.
[02:11:18.843 --> 02:11:19.744]  There's the two-hour show.
[02:11:20.124 --> 02:11:21.365]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:11:21.385 --> 02:11:22.166]  Band out video.
[02:11:22.546 --> 02:11:23.567]  I hear some of the headlines.
[02:11:23.907 --> 02:11:24.748]  Global bombshell.
[02:11:24.788 --> 02:11:27.570]  Marshall law plan announced to install Biden's dictator.
[02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:29.591]  Use US military against Americans.
[02:11:29.631 --> 02:11:30.572]  Suspend congressional oversight.
[02:11:31.272 --> 02:11:34.054]  They've been trying this a long time, but now they purge the military.
[02:11:34.414 --> 02:11:35.495]  They want to purge it further.
[02:11:35.755 --> 02:11:36.676]  They want to come after us.
[02:11:36.776 --> 02:11:40.298]  This is an indictment of everything the system is doing.
[02:11:40.738 --> 02:11:42.079]  It is insane.
[02:11:42.199 --> 02:11:43.179]  It is admitted.
[02:11:43.439 --> 02:11:47.682]  They're having congressional hearings where they go, Milley, you were a dictator for a month and ignored the president.
[02:11:48.362 --> 02:11:49.363]  He told CNN that.
[02:11:49.423 --> 02:11:50.263]  Now it's all admitted.
[02:11:50.584 --> 02:11:57.928]  I mean, they're really coming out of the closet, like with the pedophilia and the open borders and the collapsing dollar and the war with Russia.
[02:11:59.346 --> 02:12:03.682]  They're making their move, but we can raise the alarm, because clearly in the next 113 days...
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.661]  They're going to trigger something big to try to bring this in.
[02:12:08.721 --> 02:12:15.663]  But if we put enough heat on it, and if we expose it enough, they're going to be forced to back down from what they're doing.
[02:12:15.883 --> 02:12:16.984]  They're testing the waters.
[02:12:17.544 --> 02:12:18.484]  They're testing the perch.
[02:12:18.504 --> 02:12:19.825]  They're putting up trial balloons.
[02:12:20.165 --> 02:12:21.265]  They're beta testing.
[02:12:21.565 --> 02:12:23.266]  They're seeing if it'll float right now.
[02:12:23.286 --> 02:12:26.987]  We've got to let them know we're watching their every move.
[02:12:27.007 --> 02:12:28.768]  It's like the sting of a police song.
[02:12:29.648 --> 02:12:36.450]  We should come in as the next intro to Gerald Cilente with that famous Sting song, I forget the name of it, or police song.
[02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:38.470]  Everything you do, I'm watching you.
[02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:41.331]  Every breath you take, every move you make, I'm watching you.
[02:12:41.351 --> 02:12:45.872]  I know that's on the computer, we haven't played it in years, but that's exactly what's going on.
[02:12:46.253 --> 02:12:47.693]  Separately, the energy cutoff.
[02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:48.273]  Look at this.
[02:12:48.673 --> 02:12:50.954]  Germany won't survive winter without Russian gas.
[02:12:52.196 --> 02:12:53.656]  They've got government warming stations.
[02:12:53.676 --> 02:12:55.537]  They have government cooling stations.
[02:12:55.817 --> 02:13:00.138]  Report Saudi Arabia doubling purchases of cheap Russian oil and selling to the U.S.
[02:13:00.438 --> 02:13:03.339]  while Biden won't let us bring out our own oil.
[02:13:03.699 --> 02:13:06.840]  Rand Paul blasted Biden for begging and bowing down to the Saudis.
[02:13:08.201 --> 02:13:10.301]  And it goes on from there.
[02:13:10.341 --> 02:13:16.554]   But all these globalists Like the head of Italy, the Prime Minister, Mario Draghi.
[02:13:16.915 --> 02:13:18.436]  They're resigning everywhere.
[02:13:18.496 --> 02:13:21.277]  So that is a good sign overall.
[02:13:21.577 --> 02:13:22.478]  We have the audio and video.
[02:13:22.498 --> 02:13:23.378]  We never got to yesterday.
[02:13:23.398 --> 02:13:24.319]  Today, I should have played it.
[02:13:24.679 --> 02:13:25.620]  Maybe Gerald Cilente will.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:26.840]  If he wants to, it's a two-minute clip.
[02:13:27.221 --> 02:13:39.268]  But Biden threatened ex-Ukraine president when he was the president, Poroshenko, with assassination and invasion if he cooperated with Trump on the money they were stealing through the loans.
[02:13:40.325 --> 02:13:42.309]  That is the money laundering.
[02:13:42.710 --> 02:13:45.916]  All right, the top trends forecaster, Gerald Cilente.
[02:13:46.946 --> 02:13:52.527]  Is about to take over, but man, everything we've done for 28 years on air is coming to a head right now.
[02:13:53.007 --> 02:13:59.249]  This is such an incredibly critical time and all I'm asking listeners to do is do what you keep doing to change the world.
[02:13:59.489 --> 02:14:06.650]  The Enemy recognizes InfoWars as the most effective organization against them because of you and your word of mouth and your support.
[02:14:06.949 --> 02:14:14.408]   So take the live feed at Infowars.com/show and man.video and restream it, take clips out, share it,
[02:14:14.408 --> 02:14:17.989]   whatever you think's the most impacting, whatever you think's the most powerful.
[02:14:17.989 --> 02:14:19.750]  I'm not telling you what to do, it's all free to air.
[02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:22.029]  Just take it and rummah the ball.
[02:14:22.029 --> 02:14:25.988]   Like they said in the Revolutionary War, don't wait for orders from headquarters,
[02:14:25.988 --> 02:14:27.288]  go to the sound of the guns.
[02:14:27.288 --> 02:14:33.889]   This is an information war and the great general, Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster,
[02:14:33.889 --> 02:14:39.789]   takes over on the other side, and as I said, war room in 55 minutes, Owen Schroer.
[02:14:40.013 --> 02:14:44.318]  Only way the ball gets carried down the field is when you share the links to infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:14:44.758 --> 02:14:48.122]  Great job of the crew, our affiliates, our sponsors, everybody else.
[02:14:48.423 --> 02:14:51.526]  This is unprecedented, this martial law legislation.
[02:14:51.827 --> 02:14:53.929]  Gerald Cilenti, I'll break it all down straight ahead.
[02:14:53.748 --> 02:15:08.427]  Ted, please stay with us.
[02:15:08.395 --> 02:15:11.758]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[02:15:12.659 --> 02:15:16.363]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[02:15:17.083 --> 02:15:19.345]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[02:15:20.026 --> 02:15:27.195]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[02:15:27.895 --> 02:15:32.621]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[02:15:33.402 --> 02:15:39.509]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[02:15:40.592 --> 02:15:50.276]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[02:15:50.856 --> 02:15:54.497]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[02:15:55.738 --> 02:16:03.034]   Stock up now at preparetoday.com There isn't just evil in the universe.
[02:16:03.615 --> 02:16:05.156]  There's not just those that serve tyranny.
[02:16:05.536 --> 02:16:09.580]  There's those of us that love liberty and justice and the human spirit.
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:10.420]  And we're watching.
[02:16:10.941 --> 02:16:11.782]  We're taking action.
[02:16:12.322 --> 02:16:13.283]  The globalists will fail.
[02:16:13.303 --> 02:16:20.369]  And every move you make, we'll be watching you.
[02:16:23.171 --> 02:16:26.574]  Every criminal action you engage in, we're not going away.
[02:16:28.848 --> 02:16:29.648]  We're getting smarter.
[02:16:30.549 --> 02:16:31.470]  We're getting stronger.
[02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:33.491]  The tyrants are getting weaker.
[02:16:36.593 --> 02:16:48.580]  And now, one of my old friends, Gerald Cilente, the best-selling author, researcher, top trends forecaster from TrendsResearch.com, at Gerald Cilente on Twitter, takes over the balance of the hour.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:49.581]  Gerald Cilente.
[02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:53.843]  Alex, thank you so much, and thank you for all that you're doing.
[02:16:54.324 --> 02:16:56.165]  And what you're saying is perfectly clear.
[02:16:56.986 --> 02:17:06.873]  And yeah, every step you take, you know, it's also what you do, the everybody listening, it's every step we take, because they're watching us.
[02:17:07.813 --> 02:17:16.759]  And the products, the services, what InfoWars is giving you, you need not only for yourself, but to keep the movement moving.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.521]  And they're going to do everything they can to stop this.
[02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:36.774]  Let's, you know, before we go into this, I mean, before I end this, and I want to go into that video that Alex was talking about, about Biden doing the Ukraine shuffle over there, the deal.
[02:17:36.914 --> 02:17:38.756]  Look what's happening over here in New York.
[02:17:39.536 --> 02:17:40.537]  Talk about martial law.
[02:17:40.757 --> 02:17:48.824]  You got some little clown, a little clown, a nobody of nowhere, again, filling in for the other clown, little Andy Cuomo.
[02:17:49.580 --> 02:17:51.741]  This Huckleberry, Huckle, whatever her name is.
[02:17:52.182 --> 02:17:53.943]  Yeah.
[02:17:54.883 --> 02:17:56.044]  They want to pass a law.
[02:17:56.064 --> 02:18:01.327]  They made it a regulation, which actually would have become a law had it not been for this great woman.
[02:18:01.367 --> 02:18:04.409]  I don't remember her name, who's a lawyer who stopped it.
[02:18:04.949 --> 02:18:09.151]  That said, these, quote, health officials could officially lock you down.
[02:18:09.832 --> 02:18:10.232]  That's right.
[02:18:11.075 --> 02:18:12.676]  They don't have to test you, do anything.
[02:18:12.956 --> 02:18:14.717]  They say you're transmitting a disease.
[02:18:14.997 --> 02:18:20.059]  They're locking you down or putting you in a quarantine camp!
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.521]  Heil Håkon!
[02:18:25.842 --> 02:18:28.003]  If only a woman was in charge.
[02:18:28.924 --> 02:18:30.665]  I'm tired of that crap.
[02:18:31.345 --> 02:18:33.226]  Good and bad comes in all of them.
[02:18:33.786 --> 02:18:35.207]  Race, creeds, and color.
[02:18:35.887 --> 02:18:36.288]  Shut it!
[02:18:37.148 --> 02:18:41.639]   Because, again, A woman just defeated a woman.
[02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:46.063]  A great woman lawyer went after this Huckleberry.
[02:18:46.083 --> 02:18:52.670]  Who, by the way, her husband's involved with the gambling syndicate.
[02:18:53.314 --> 02:18:56.575]  Yeah, play the Attorney General or District Attorney or whatever.
[02:18:56.835 --> 02:18:58.756]  District Attorney up there around Buffalo.
[02:18:59.156 --> 02:18:59.256]  Oh!
[02:19:00.456 --> 02:19:00.556]  Oh!
[02:19:00.776 --> 02:19:02.877]  Hey, all the New Yorkers!
[02:19:03.437 --> 02:19:05.317]  All you libtard freaks!
[02:19:05.937 --> 02:19:07.038]  All you people!
[02:19:07.438 --> 02:19:08.478]  I'm from Brooklyn.
[02:19:08.698 --> 02:19:10.419]  You're not from Brooklyn!
[02:19:11.739 --> 02:19:14.240]  You people aren't the people I grew up with!
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:16.500]  The Bronx or Yonkers!
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:17.841]  You're cowards!
[02:19:18.281 --> 02:19:19.421]  Hey, what did Hulkle do?
[02:19:20.321 --> 02:19:22.322]  Oh, they just shoved through this, uh...
[02:19:23.194 --> 02:19:30.098]  Thing over there where the bigs could get all this free money because they're gonna build the economy and she took what?
[02:19:30.118 --> 02:19:40.265]  800 million dollars of our money or more to build the Buffalo Bills new stadium?
[02:19:41.366 --> 02:19:43.887]  These are the freaks you got in control!
[02:19:45.468 --> 02:19:50.071]  Now let's go back to what Alex is talking about the new martial law.
[02:19:50.411 --> 02:19:52.453]  They're doing it everywhere and at different levels.
[02:19:53.709 --> 02:19:54.629]  Health officials.
[02:19:55.189 --> 02:19:56.930]  Official pieces of crap.
[02:19:57.370 --> 02:20:02.251]  That's when you see the word official and pieces of crap.
[02:20:03.511 --> 02:20:15.053]  These are little low-life boys and girls who can't get a job in the real world, suck into the political system.
[02:20:16.954 --> 02:20:18.394]  Lola, there she is.
[02:20:18.574 --> 02:20:19.134]  Oh, he is.
[02:20:19.474 --> 02:20:19.974]  That is.
[02:20:21.435 --> 02:20:23.215]  L-O-L-E, Lola.
[02:20:24.045 --> 02:20:24.285]  Yep.
[02:20:25.405 --> 02:20:30.907]  This guy got more chins than Chinatown and he's telling, he, she, it, telling me about health.
[02:20:31.808 --> 02:20:38.210]  These are people that can't get a job in the real world, fail in the real world, and suck into the political system that are telling us what to do.
[02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:40.110]  Get that in your head.
[02:20:40.751 --> 02:20:46.592]  And then, boy, do they become arrogant when they have this power, just like they're trying to pass this law in New York.
[02:20:47.133 --> 02:20:50.914]  And now they're doing it with the militarization right out in front of our eyes.
[02:20:51.872 --> 02:21:01.796]  And that's why every breath you take, every step you take, they're watching you and it's up to you to change it.
[02:21:02.336 --> 02:21:03.516]  And what am I going to do?
[02:21:03.756 --> 02:21:05.117]  And what am I going to do?
[02:21:05.157 --> 02:21:08.158]  Oh God, when I hear that from people, what are you going to do?
[02:21:08.698 --> 02:21:10.539]  How about growing up and doing something?
[02:21:10.859 --> 02:21:13.300]  How about becoming a real man or a real woman?
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:24.843]   If we don't fight and unite, For freedom, peace, and justice, and I'm saying fighting as a warrior for the Prince of Peace in a peaceful way.
[02:21:25.584 --> 02:21:26.304]  We lose.
[02:21:26.324 --> 02:21:27.345]  End of game.
[02:21:28.946 --> 02:21:38.815]  What Alex is talking about, this new martial law, cannot be more dictatorial if only Lenin was back.
[02:21:39.675 --> 02:21:42.438]  If only Lenin ran the United States.
[02:21:43.378 --> 02:21:43.679]  Yeah.
[02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:46.321]  Hey, look!
[02:21:46.983 --> 02:21:56.811]  They got a guy to play a comedian in Ukraine and his role as a comic on TV was to play the president of Ukraine.
[02:21:58.993 --> 02:22:02.856]  We could get a guy like Lemonhead, the guy on CNN.
[02:22:03.596 --> 02:22:05.758]  We could run him and he could become president.
[02:22:06.058 --> 02:22:07.559]  You can put any freak you want.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:11.362]  You want to see how stupid Americans are?
[02:22:11.883 --> 02:22:14.345]  You want to see how stupid Americans are?
[02:22:16.618 --> 02:22:17.838]  Just take a look at Biden.
[02:22:20.799 --> 02:22:22.160]  I'm so glad Trump is gone.
[02:22:22.260 --> 02:22:24.020]  And I am too, Biden.
[02:22:24.060 --> 02:22:26.221]  Don't agree with Trump, as Alex knows.
[02:22:26.501 --> 02:22:28.121]  Gerald, he said, you say anything you want.
[02:22:28.581 --> 02:22:39.764]  I agreed with him up until he started the assassinations of Iran, what he did with Venezuela, and the tax deal for the rich.
[02:22:40.265 --> 02:22:41.325]  1% got 82% of it.
[02:22:41.585 --> 02:22:45.446]  And he didn't build the infrastructure and he stopped on the wall.
[02:22:46.954 --> 02:22:50.017]  And then you had Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[02:22:50.477 --> 02:22:53.379]  Folks, hope and change you can believe in.
[02:22:53.660 --> 02:22:55.021]  Yeah, small change.
[02:22:55.261 --> 02:22:56.722]  You got change, you got a penny?
[02:22:56.942 --> 02:22:58.364]  Because that's what I'm going to give you.
[02:22:58.384 --> 02:23:01.646]  Oh, no, then we had George W. Bush.
[02:23:02.467 --> 02:23:06.190]  Another little daddy's boy, born on third base, thought he had a home run.
[02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:14.610]   Oh, he's talking about the hokal that, that, that, uh, Took over from arrogant little Andy Cuomo, the daddy's boy.
[02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:23.193]  I just came back from the city yesterday, visited my sister in a nursing home, coming back over the Mario Cuomo Bridge.
[02:23:24.553 --> 02:23:28.755]  Cost us over three million dollars to rename it after my daddy.
[02:23:29.115 --> 02:23:30.995]  Your daddy's a piece of crap.
[02:23:31.395 --> 02:23:34.496]  My daddy, I'm naming the bridge after him.
[02:23:34.896 --> 02:23:37.337]  And it's only going to cost you 30 million dollars.
[02:23:37.857 --> 02:23:39.598]  Oh, there's the other arrogant guy.
[02:23:40.273 --> 02:23:42.438]  Little, uh, his brother there.
[02:23:42.458 --> 02:23:42.518]  Yep.
[02:23:47.010 --> 02:23:48.490]  One big club and you ain't in it.
[02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:49.790]  You got it, everybody?
[02:23:50.411 --> 02:23:51.351]  That's what it is.
[02:23:51.751 --> 02:23:54.912]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:23:55.432 --> 02:23:59.093]  These are the freak loaders that are in charge of our lives.
[02:24:00.053 --> 02:24:01.594]  Oh, and Hollywood!
[02:24:01.854 --> 02:24:04.354]  You little freaks over there in Hollywood!
[02:24:04.754 --> 02:24:11.076]  You gave little Andy Cuomo an Emmy because boy, oh girl!
[02:24:12.837 --> 02:24:13.557]  Oh, Lola!
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:23.782]  Did he know how to play dictator of New York with his BS lockdown baloney?
[02:24:25.003 --> 02:24:38.346]  Yeah, the COVID war that destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people around the world brought to you by arrogant Andy Cuomo.
[02:24:39.947 --> 02:24:42.288]  I had a rally here when everything was locked down.
[02:24:42.348 --> 02:24:43.388]  Boy, did they hate me.
[02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:47.470]  I died, by the way, from the rally back in July of 2020.
[02:24:48.350 --> 02:24:49.670]  And so did everybody else.
[02:24:49.711 --> 02:24:50.931]  This isn't really me.
[02:24:51.351 --> 02:24:51.791]  No, no.
[02:24:52.511 --> 02:24:53.012]  Let's see.
[02:24:53.672 --> 02:24:55.032]  Zuckerberg created me.
[02:24:55.092 --> 02:24:56.433]  I'm a meta-Selendier.
[02:24:59.114 --> 02:24:59.394]  Yeah.
[02:25:00.334 --> 02:25:07.857]  And I'm holding a peace and freedom rally this coming Saturday up here in Kingston, New York.
[02:25:09.867 --> 02:25:19.414]  Judge Andrew Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Null, Phil Giraldi, The Five, The Hot Damn Band, myself and others.
[02:25:20.515 --> 02:25:26.520]  If you don't do anything to unite for peace and fight for freedom, you deserve to rot in hell.
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:27.941]  End the story.
[02:25:28.321 --> 02:25:29.622]  Save it for somebody else.
[02:25:29.942 --> 02:25:31.323]  You don't want to support him for worse.
[02:25:31.363 --> 02:25:32.144]  Don't do anything.
[02:25:33.265 --> 02:25:35.587]  Go out for the Starbucks coffee instead.
[02:25:35.627 --> 02:25:35.807]  Yeah.
[02:25:36.522 --> 02:25:39.544]  You better support OccupyPeace.com.
[02:25:40.124 --> 02:25:41.545]  OccupyPeace.com.
[02:25:42.366 --> 02:25:43.106]  We'll be right back.
[02:25:44.447 --> 02:25:46.649]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:46.689 --> 02:25:46.909]  Yep.
[02:25:48.190 --> 02:25:48.910]  And, uh, 1776.
[02:25:49.451 --> 02:25:50.131]  No, that's a, uh, 1776.
[02:25:50.171 --> 02:25:54.294]  I went to PS 76, by the way, in the Bronx.
[02:25:54.293 --> 02:26:01.654]   70, 76. I went to PS 76, by the way, in the Bronx. Yep. Ran away from kindergarten and
[02:26:01.654 --> 02:26:04.132]  crossed the Boston Post Road at four and a half years old.
[02:26:04.343 --> 02:26:06.365]  Hated every day of government school.
[02:26:06.965 --> 02:26:07.486]  But anyway, 1776.
[02:26:07.866 --> 02:26:12.771]  The American spirit that you're not allowed to talk about anymore.
[02:26:17.035 --> 02:26:39.681]   We have sent out nearly 40,000 press releases all around the world of our Occupy Peace Peace and Freedom Rally this coming Saturday on the Four Corners of Freedom, Crown and John Street in Kingston, New York.
[02:26:39.701 --> 02:26:39.681]  1776.
[02:26:40.061 --> 02:26:50.423]  The constitution that was written for Kingston, for New York State, when Kingston was the first capital, they wrote it here.
[02:26:51.463 --> 02:26:55.264]  Over 70% of America's constitution comes from that constitution.
[02:26:57.921 --> 02:27:11.328]  Right over there, I probably could hit it with a rock if I threw it, is the courthouse where that Constitution at that site was written.
[02:27:12.849 --> 02:27:17.011]  John Jay, the Supreme Court judge, was a judge over there.
[02:27:18.712 --> 02:27:28.377]   I bought three of the most historic buildings in the United States, the only place on each corner Where there's a pre-revolutionary war stone building.
[02:27:29.878 --> 02:27:32.660]  Because the seeds of democracy were sown here.
[02:27:37.563 --> 02:27:38.904]  And that's why I bought them.
[02:27:39.664 --> 02:27:40.125]  There it is.
[02:27:41.525 --> 02:27:42.126]  Four corners.
[02:27:44.207 --> 02:27:44.967]  And I own three.
[02:27:46.488 --> 02:27:58.694]   And I bought them only because all four stone houses at this intersection built between 1663, 1775, prior to the Revolutionary War.
[02:28:01.535 --> 02:28:06.138]  And I bought them because I was looking to leave the country at one time, because I got fed up with the crap.
[02:28:07.198 --> 02:28:13.121]  Back in 2010, when the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, the murderous Barack Obama.
[02:28:13.761 --> 02:28:15.642]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of here.
[02:28:15.662 --> 02:28:17.963]  I want that guy Assad out of here.
[02:28:18.584 --> 02:28:21.345]  Oh yeah, how about the Afghan troop surge, folks?
[02:28:22.546 --> 02:28:22.906]  Anyway.
[02:28:23.706 --> 02:28:26.167]  Make a very long story short, it was in Berlin in 2012.
[02:28:26.747 --> 02:28:31.169]  And Germany was at the height of Western civilization.
[02:28:33.130 --> 02:28:37.592]  The 1930s, culturally, scientifically, philosophically.
[02:28:39.993 --> 02:28:42.895]  Berlin was grander than Paris before it was bombed down.
[02:28:44.275 --> 02:28:47.397]  Think of the great German names, Bach, Beethoven, Fogg, on and on.
[02:28:48.778 --> 02:28:49.578]  The philosophers.
[02:28:51.835 --> 02:28:55.157]  I'm saying to myself, why didn't the people stop this before the joint was destroyed?
[02:28:55.617 --> 02:28:56.718]  Dresden, bombed away.
[02:28:57.258 --> 02:28:58.018]  Where were the people?
[02:28:59.819 --> 02:29:00.740]  Where were the people?
[02:29:02.141 --> 02:29:03.221]  I'm of Italian descent.
[02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:05.202]  My blood is, my blood's Italian.
[02:29:05.242 --> 02:29:06.183]  My heart's American.
[02:29:07.684 --> 02:29:09.705]  Where were the Italians to stop a Mussolini?
[02:29:10.405 --> 02:29:12.947]  And now Italy is one of the most submissive.
[02:29:14.448 --> 02:29:15.608]  People don't fight at all.
[02:29:16.409 --> 02:29:16.809]  Lost it.
[02:29:17.889 --> 02:29:19.250]  I don't even like going back anymore.
[02:29:20.011 --> 02:29:20.631]  Breaks my heart.
[02:29:22.403 --> 02:29:28.065]  Last time I was there in 2015 at World's Fair, brought to you by McDonald's and Coca-Cola.
[02:29:28.085 --> 02:29:28.865]  It was a disgrace.
[02:29:28.885 --> 02:29:32.426]  I had fans over there and I went with my cousin Vinny.
[02:29:32.446 --> 02:29:34.567]  I actually do have a cousin Vinny.
[02:29:36.027 --> 02:29:40.289]  And, um, out for dinner and they're all complaining about the bureaucracy.
[02:29:40.349 --> 02:29:42.129]  I can't paint my house the color I want.
[02:29:42.169 --> 02:29:43.190]  I can't cut down this tree.
[02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:44.930]  I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.
[02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:46.411]  I said, what are you guys doing?
[02:29:47.051 --> 02:29:48.491]  He said, what are we going to do?
[02:29:49.712 --> 02:29:50.392]  And my heart dropped.
[02:29:52.691 --> 02:29:53.811]  That's the America we're at.
[02:29:53.831 --> 02:29:54.471]  What are you gonna do?
[02:29:55.232 --> 02:29:55.852]  It's up to you.
[02:29:56.332 --> 02:29:56.552]  Yeah.
[02:29:57.092 --> 02:29:57.652]  I'm angry.
[02:29:57.752 --> 02:29:58.652]  You bet I'm angry.
[02:29:58.992 --> 02:30:00.973]  I'm angry at the people that aren't doing anything.
[02:30:02.553 --> 02:30:03.453]  What does it cost you?
[02:30:04.413 --> 02:30:07.774]  What does it cost you to buy the products that you need from InfoWars?
[02:30:08.354 --> 02:30:11.555]  What does it cost you to subscribe to the Trends Journal for $2 a week?
[02:30:12.275 --> 02:30:12.615]  A week!
[02:30:13.815 --> 02:30:14.655]  This week was only 175 pages.
[02:30:14.715 --> 02:30:14.895]  No ads.
[02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:23.470]  Well, I can't read a hundred and seventy... Hey, hey, Gatson, you read what you want to read.
[02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:28.412]  This is, we're telling you what's going on, what it means, and what's next, and maybe what you want to do.
[02:30:30.253 --> 02:30:32.133]  Oh, you want me to donate to Occupy Peace?
[02:30:32.793 --> 02:30:33.774]  I want to occupy peace?
[02:30:33.794 --> 02:30:34.614]  What's wrong with you?
[02:30:37.075 --> 02:30:45.958]  I gotta go to... When I was a kid, a slice of pizza and a soda was 25 cents.
[02:30:48.186 --> 02:30:51.969]  Today it's like about $4, $5.
[02:30:52.790 --> 02:30:54.552]  Could you afford a slice of pizza?
[02:30:59.376 --> 02:31:00.637]  We're in critical times.
[02:31:02.098 --> 02:31:03.800]  World War III has begun.
[02:31:06.281 --> 02:31:12.361]   Keep sending more and more of our money to keep bloodying the killing fields.
[02:31:12.361 --> 02:31:19.322]  Russia's not going to lose.
[02:31:19.564 --> 02:31:20.885]  I'm totally against the war.
[02:31:21.065 --> 02:31:21.925]  Totally against it.
[02:31:22.765 --> 02:31:36.650]  As a matter of fact, when we come back, we got to play that clip that Alex Jones has of Biden talking to Deal.
[02:31:39.330 --> 02:31:44.672]  And again, his son there, Hunter, Hunter for Coke.
[02:31:47.708 --> 02:31:51.830]  Oh, and John Kerry, another arrogant little boy of nothing.
[02:31:54.051 --> 02:31:55.411]  Another member of the club.
[02:31:55.431 --> 02:32:01.114]  They married the Heinz lady and Chris Heinz.
[02:32:04.055 --> 02:32:12.799]  Biden and another guy did a deal right after they overthrew the government of Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 with Burisma Energy.
[02:32:16.713 --> 02:32:17.913]  And put them on the board.
[02:32:19.434 --> 02:32:22.535]  And what does Biden's boy know about oil?
[02:32:22.555 --> 02:32:24.896]  Or the Heinz 57 kid?
[02:32:25.836 --> 02:32:27.296]  Zip, zero, nada.
[02:32:27.316 --> 02:32:31.518]  Ah, but they only made about $30 million, Salenti.
[02:32:31.558 --> 02:32:32.478]  Calm down.
[02:32:32.678 --> 02:32:33.398]  What, $3 million?
[02:32:33.418 --> 02:32:34.299]  We have a million.
[02:32:35.959 --> 02:32:37.740]  $30,000 a month, Biden was getting.
[02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:39.000]  He made $3 million.
[02:32:40.300 --> 02:32:40.480]  Yep.
[02:32:42.321 --> 02:32:45.042]  And look at what Alex Jones and his staff have to do.
[02:32:46.823 --> 02:32:47.543]  To earn money.
[02:32:48.404 --> 02:32:54.406]  Look what I have to do to put a magazine out and earn money.
[02:32:55.066 --> 02:32:59.307]  Oh, and by the way, where are the billionaires for peace?
[02:33:00.208 --> 02:33:01.868]  Hey, Musk, you got Lockjaw.
[02:33:02.028 --> 02:33:02.968]  You talk a lot.
[02:33:02.988 --> 02:33:05.689]  Hey, Bezos, where's the BS?
[02:33:05.769 --> 02:33:07.470]  Oh, you got the Washington Post.
[02:33:08.270 --> 02:33:13.652]  Oh, yeah, to tie into the government.
[02:33:16.053 --> 02:33:16.213]  Yep.
[02:33:18.467 --> 02:33:19.967]  We're the billionaires to peace.
[02:33:20.728 --> 02:33:21.468]  Not a penny.
[02:33:22.308 --> 02:33:23.449]  Not a penny for peace.
[02:33:24.269 --> 02:33:25.209]  Only more war.
[02:33:26.489 --> 02:33:32.631]  Again, when we come back, we're going to play that clip that Alex Jones was talking about.
[02:33:32.671 --> 02:33:36.633]  Again, you want to see how stupid the American people are?
[02:33:39.213 --> 02:33:40.274]  Take a look at Biden.
[02:33:41.554 --> 02:33:44.435]  Put that poster of that out of his mind cat up there.
[02:33:46.778 --> 02:33:50.760]  And boy, all you libtards, oh, you're so happy Trump is gone.
[02:33:51.240 --> 02:34:00.083]  Again, as much as I don't like Trump because of who he is in a lot of ways, if Trump was president, I believe there would be no Ukraine war.
[02:34:00.123 --> 02:34:01.804]  Again, I call it like I see it.
[02:34:04.265 --> 02:34:06.066]  But instead, we're at war.
[02:34:06.986 --> 02:34:09.207]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:09.707 --> 02:34:09.947]  Yep.
[02:34:10.127 --> 02:34:10.328]  Yep.
[02:34:10.528 --> 02:34:16.290]  And the one that, that, that new weight loss product that they have, that's a must.
[02:34:17.247 --> 02:34:18.027]  That's a must.
[02:34:18.747 --> 02:34:21.428]  You know, you think I... I am Italian.
[02:34:22.428 --> 02:34:23.628]  I love to cook.
[02:34:23.828 --> 02:34:26.329]  I could eat macaroni every day.
[02:34:27.409 --> 02:34:29.269]  I do what I can to stay in shape.
[02:34:31.349 --> 02:34:34.190]  The older you get, the more you gotta do.
[02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:38.991]  The better you have to get on your diet, the more you have to work out.
[02:34:39.011 --> 02:34:42.011]  I increased my workouts from when I used to do it.
[02:34:42.731 --> 02:34:43.932]  I try to do them every day.
[02:34:45.252 --> 02:34:46.552]  Because you gotta stay in the fight.
[02:34:47.307 --> 02:34:51.508]  Don't want to end up as a, uh, inmate in a nursing home.
[02:34:53.608 --> 02:34:55.629]  And again, I went to see my sister yesterday.
[02:34:55.649 --> 02:34:56.409]  It breaks my heart.
[02:34:57.189 --> 02:35:01.250]  As a matter of fact, I'm getting her out of there, hopefully, and I'm bringing her up here to live with me.
[02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:07.691]  And, um, so you got to get in, stay in your shape, stay in shape.
[02:35:07.731 --> 02:35:13.813]  I mean, the crap that people are eating, you know, anyway, go, go to InfoWars.
[02:35:13.833 --> 02:35:14.933]  They got these great products.
[02:35:15.783 --> 02:35:22.848]  And I mentioned before, we're going to go to that video of Biden saying what the deal is.
[02:35:22.888 --> 02:35:27.151]  This guy, Poroshenko, by the way, he's another oligarch.
[02:35:28.032 --> 02:35:29.993]  And the oligarchs run Ukraine.
[02:35:30.493 --> 02:35:36.638]  And it's one of the most corrupt countries in the world, not according to me, according to the studies done.
[02:35:37.078 --> 02:35:38.119]  You guys got that video?
[02:35:41.721 --> 02:35:42.502]  All right, there you go.
[02:35:45.295 --> 02:35:46.616]  November 16, 2016.
[02:35:47.256 --> 02:35:54.058]  Two weeks after Donald Trump's victory, Joe Biden is on the phone with Gorshenko.
[02:35:54.578 --> 02:35:56.998]  His voice, tenser now than before.
[02:35:57.178 --> 02:35:59.819]  This is getting very, very close.
[02:35:59.859 --> 02:36:03.520]  What I don't want to have happen, I don't want trouble.
[02:36:05.789 --> 02:36:13.234]  In other words, Biden does not want Ukraine asking for more money from Trump.
[02:36:13.073 --> 02:36:16.633]  he's going to be looked to to pour more money into Ukraine.
[02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:21.432]   That's how he'll think about it before he gets sophisticated enough to know the details.
[02:36:21.432 --> 02:36:26.193]   In other words, Biden does not want Ukraine asking for more money from Trump.
[02:36:26.193 --> 02:36:29.952]  Doing so would cause Trump to look into the details.
[02:36:29.952 --> 02:36:48.953]  So anything you can do to push the provocative...
[02:36:36.290 --> 02:36:38.612]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:36:38.531 --> 02:36:39.531]  Yep.
[02:36:39.531 --> 02:36:40.531]  There you got it.
[02:36:40.531 --> 02:36:41.531]  Your economic and political security.
[02:36:41.531 --> 02:36:42.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:42.531 --> 02:36:43.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:43.531 --> 02:36:44.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:44.531 --> 02:36:45.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:45.531 --> 02:36:46.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:46.531 --> 02:36:47.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:48.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:48.531 --> 02:36:49.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:49.531 --> 02:36:50.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:50.531 --> 02:36:51.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:51.531 --> 02:36:52.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:52.531 --> 02:36:53.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:53.531 --> 02:36:54.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:54.531 --> 02:36:55.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:55.531 --> 02:36:56.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:56.531 --> 02:36:57.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:57.531 --> 02:36:58.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:58.531 --> 02:36:59.531]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:36:59.531 --> 02:37:11.650]  And here's your trends journal from 2008.
[02:37:11.625 --> 02:37:23.068]  As the United States, we wrote about it as it was happening, the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych.
[02:37:24.049 --> 02:37:25.029]  And you know what was behind it?
[02:37:25.809 --> 02:37:26.790]  Biden just mentioned it.
[02:37:26.810 --> 02:37:33.652]  The IMF, the International Mafia, excuse me, Monetary Fund.
[02:37:36.064 --> 02:37:38.986]  Hey, only the Italians have the Mafia.
[02:37:39.026 --> 02:37:40.628]  What's wrong with you, Salenti?
[02:37:41.168 --> 02:37:43.290]  We only can make fun of the Italians.
[02:37:44.371 --> 02:37:46.032]  Oh, Italian lives don't matter?
[02:37:46.692 --> 02:37:49.335]  Nah, we could, hey, we could make you talk like this.
[02:37:49.835 --> 02:37:52.037]  We could make fun of you, hey.
[02:37:52.857 --> 02:37:54.299]  Yeah, I had enough of that crap, too.
[02:37:54.339 --> 02:37:55.319]  I don't like that stuff.
[02:37:56.200 --> 02:37:56.520]  Anyway.
[02:37:58.962 --> 02:37:59.763]  See, here was the deal.
[02:38:02.505 --> 02:38:09.513]   As I said, Ukraine's By the data, you can look it up, the most corrupt country in Europe and among the world.
[02:38:10.773 --> 02:38:17.235]  After the Soviet Union broke up in 1990, it's been downhill for Ukraine.
[02:38:19.315 --> 02:38:20.595]  They've been busted out.
[02:38:21.736 --> 02:38:26.056]  And the United States, they had the Orange Revolution back in the early 2000s.
[02:38:26.096 --> 02:38:27.257]  They put in a Western cat.
[02:38:27.677 --> 02:38:28.857]  People got fed up with that.
[02:38:29.617 --> 02:38:33.358]  They put in, um, they voted for Viktor Yanukovych and he won.
[02:38:34.252 --> 02:38:36.353]  But the country was in dire financial straits.
[02:38:37.574 --> 02:38:38.234]  So what did he do?
[02:38:38.915 --> 02:38:46.119]  He went to the IMF and the EU and he cut a deal with them to bail out the country.
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.683]  And Putin didn't like that because they were moving back into the EU.
[02:38:52.323 --> 02:39:11.196]   And the deal was when, again, all in details in your Trends Journal, just the facts, that when the Soviet Union broke up, The deal between Gorbachev from the Soviet Union and Reagan and Gorbachev and Bush Senior was that NATO would not move one inch further.
[02:39:11.256 --> 02:39:13.258]  That's the quote, not one inch further.
[02:39:14.899 --> 02:39:17.961]  There were 16 of them then, I think there are 27 of them now.
[02:39:18.201 --> 02:39:22.964]  Anyway, so Putin said, listen, I got a better deal for you.
[02:39:25.866 --> 02:39:29.188]  I'll give you a lower interest rate than the IMF and EU are giving you.
[02:39:30.129 --> 02:39:32.731]  And I'm going to cut back your energy prices.
[02:39:34.712 --> 02:39:37.314]  Yanukovych says, hey, that sounds like a good deal for me.
[02:39:39.055 --> 02:39:40.636]  And that was the beginning of the end.
[02:39:44.399 --> 02:39:47.501]  Victoria Nuland, Jeffrey Piatt, caught on the phone.
[02:39:50.083 --> 02:39:50.743]  F.U.
[02:39:50.923 --> 02:39:51.724]  to the E.U.
[02:39:52.424 --> 02:39:55.807]  We're putting Yatts in there, this guy Yatts, Yatts and Yuck, a little boy of nothing.
[02:39:56.528 --> 02:39:58.209]  Until they brought Poroshenko in.
[02:39:58.689 --> 02:40:13.076]  Again, by the way, Poroshenko is also being brought up on charges, violations that he's committed and had gone back to Ukraine to show that he was going to fight them.
[02:40:14.377 --> 02:40:24.982]  He has a track record of being allegedly, allegedly, so I'm not saying he did it, as being a money mobster.
[02:40:25.879 --> 02:40:26.960]  In a lot of ways.
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:29.621]  Again, another oligarch.
[02:40:30.321 --> 02:40:32.962]  And that's who runs Ukraine.
[02:40:34.543 --> 02:40:36.564]  But they don't talk about this in the media.
[02:40:38.144 --> 02:40:47.748]  So going back to Ukraine, today their foreign minister came out and said, yeah, we'll do a peace treaty after we defeat Russia.
[02:40:49.649 --> 02:40:50.369]  A peace treaty?
[02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:53.691]  After you defeat Russia?
[02:40:55.748 --> 02:40:57.029]  You're not going to defeat Russia.
[02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:03.573]  Russia controls over 20%, nearly 25% of Ukraine.
[02:41:05.114 --> 02:41:06.595]  Hey, yeah, we're going to get it back!
[02:41:07.236 --> 02:41:07.776]  No, you're not.
[02:41:09.217 --> 02:41:11.579]  Oh, and they're taking down that statue of Catherine the Great.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:14.761]  And when did that go back to like the 1700s?
[02:41:15.902 --> 02:41:18.964]  You mean you two countries have been going at it for that long?
[02:41:19.805 --> 02:41:21.686]  And you want me to get involved as an American?
[02:41:25.259 --> 02:41:30.340]  You ask anybody about what I just spoke about, the overthrow.
[02:41:34.442 --> 02:41:35.202]  They don't have a clue.
[02:41:36.402 --> 02:41:52.687]  They could tell you the batting average of 95% of the ballplayers, what team they're on, who's winning, who's losing, how many games behind the second place team is, and don't have a clue about what in the world is going on.
[02:41:55.649 --> 02:41:57.972]  You're getting that from InfoWars.
[02:41:58.012 --> 02:41:59.353]  I go to InfoWars every day.
[02:42:00.034 --> 02:42:02.576]  I want to say, what do they got there?
[02:42:03.197 --> 02:42:04.138]  What can I learn from them?
[02:42:04.158 --> 02:42:04.899]  What can I pick up?
[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.221]  What do they have that other people don't have?
[02:42:09.824 --> 02:42:10.605]  I go to Drudge.
[02:42:10.685 --> 02:42:12.026]  Drudge is a drudge, man.
[02:42:12.507 --> 02:42:13.969]  It's the perfect name for it now.
[02:42:14.009 --> 02:42:14.709]  What a drudge.
[02:42:17.353 --> 02:42:21.498]  I want to see, I want to get, I want to get information from everybody all over, then I'll decide.
[02:42:21.518 --> 02:42:22.839]  I think for myself.
[02:42:23.180 --> 02:42:25.102]  And that's the motto of the Trans Journal Magazine.
[02:42:25.142 --> 02:42:25.823]  Think for yourself.
[02:42:28.025 --> 02:42:29.527]  And that's what InfoWars does.
[02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:32.170]  Think for yourself.
[02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:33.471]  That's what the Trans Journal does.
[02:42:33.511 --> 02:42:34.172]  Think for yourself.
[02:42:35.265 --> 02:42:38.446]  And now is the most important time of our lives to think for ourselves.
[02:42:38.826 --> 02:42:48.388]  But most importantly, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men, says Samuel Adams.
[02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:51.069]  And that's us.
[02:42:53.069 --> 02:43:01.031]  That's Transjournal subscribers, transjournal.com, and that's InfoWars subscribers.
[02:43:03.524 --> 02:43:03.964]  We're it.
[02:43:04.545 --> 02:43:05.345]  And we could beat them.
[02:43:05.385 --> 02:43:06.105]  They're nobodies.
[02:43:06.866 --> 02:43:08.046]  They're little boys of nothing.
[02:43:08.407 --> 02:43:09.587]  They're little girls of nothing.
[02:43:09.647 --> 02:43:10.588]  I gotta be equal.
[02:43:11.388 --> 02:43:12.949]  They're little boys of nothing.
[02:43:13.669 --> 02:43:15.510]  Again, Kingston, New York.
[02:43:16.231 --> 02:43:16.971]  This Saturday.
[02:43:17.852 --> 02:43:19.132]  The Four Corners of Freedom.
[02:43:19.793 --> 02:43:20.913]  John and Crown Street.
[02:43:21.533 --> 02:43:22.154]  Two o'clock.
[02:43:22.774 --> 02:43:24.595]  And again, I'm an American.
[02:43:24.935 --> 02:43:26.536]  I believe in George Washington.
[02:43:27.297 --> 02:43:29.037]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:43:29.798 --> 02:43:31.899]  A general and a president who really fought.
[02:43:33.095 --> 02:43:35.076]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:35.736 --> 02:43:39.117]  And as the cover of the Trends Journal, another Anthony Frieda.
[02:43:40.637 --> 02:43:41.898]  Genius work he does.
[02:43:43.158 --> 02:43:46.559]  Stay in the mainstream, stay stupid.
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:48.240]  That's it.
[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:53.081]  Stay in the mainstream, stay stupid.
[02:43:53.921 --> 02:43:54.582]  He's brilliant.
[02:43:54.762 --> 02:43:57.262]  You look at it closely, it's amazing what he does.
[02:43:58.103 --> 02:43:59.283]  And that's what info was.
[02:43:59.323 --> 02:44:00.684]  That's what we do at the Trends Journal.
[02:44:00.704 --> 02:44:02.044]  We're taking you out of the mainstream.
[02:44:03.622 --> 02:44:05.764]  And the mainstream is just going to take it down the toilet.
[02:44:07.224 --> 02:44:21.474]  The important product, you know, I've been on Infowars a lot of years and their new diet force to me, this is really essential.
[02:44:24.456 --> 02:44:25.856]  42% of Americans are obese.
[02:44:27.698 --> 02:44:32.781]  Let's go back to the COVID war that they never would talk about who was dying from it.
[02:44:34.713 --> 02:44:40.016]  Type 2 diabetics, obesity, respiratory ailments.
[02:44:40.717 --> 02:44:41.657]  Those are the champions.
[02:44:43.158 --> 02:44:46.820]  TrendsJournal.com, we only stay with the facts, only stay with the facts.
[02:44:47.441 --> 02:44:50.903]  According to the CDC, hey, if they say it, it must be true.
[02:44:53.744 --> 02:45:06.375]   61% of all the 1 to 17 year olds that were hospitalized for COVID Obesity.
[02:45:08.736 --> 02:45:11.558]  This diet for us is essential.
[02:45:12.299 --> 02:45:12.799]  There you go.
[02:45:13.900 --> 02:45:14.440]  America?
[02:45:16.281 --> 02:45:28.388]  Boy, you know, maybe after, like, a cat like that would go out, you put him on a spit, cut it up, you don't have to bury him, you can save some money, and we can feed the poor.
[02:45:29.189 --> 02:45:29.529]  Yeah.
[02:45:29.549 --> 02:45:32.351]  I mean, there's a lot of meat there to sell.
[02:45:34.065 --> 02:45:36.446]  You know, I grew up, this didn't exist.
[02:45:37.666 --> 02:45:44.289]  You look at the pictures from Woodstock, back in 1969.
[02:45:45.069 --> 02:45:50.732]  You didn't see any of this stuff.
[02:45:51.792 --> 02:45:52.633]  And now it's everywhere.
[02:45:54.573 --> 02:45:56.214]  It's more, it's so important.
[02:45:56.774 --> 02:46:00.316]  You know, by the way, if I got elected, I want a fat tax.
[02:46:00.896 --> 02:46:01.336]  That's right.
[02:46:01.936 --> 02:46:03.537]  The more you weigh, the more you pay.
[02:46:04.662 --> 02:46:26.193]  I don't want to pay for your problem, man and women, because I do the data and I know how much it's driving up our health costs because you're overflowing the medical system in detail in your trends journal over the years.
[02:46:28.014 --> 02:46:28.414]  Facts.
[02:46:29.134 --> 02:46:30.395]  Facts from institutes.
[02:46:33.692 --> 02:46:34.892]  It is so important.
[02:46:34.972 --> 02:46:38.713]  This isn't like, you know, oh, I can do it.
[02:46:38.753 --> 02:46:39.693]  I don't have to do it.
[02:46:39.733 --> 02:46:40.713]  I don't want to do it.
[02:46:41.414 --> 02:46:42.314]  You need to do it.
[02:46:42.594 --> 02:46:43.434]  Diet force.
[02:46:43.894 --> 02:46:51.956]  If you're not in the best shape, then you're not in the best head.
[02:46:52.956 --> 02:46:53.396]  Period.
[02:46:53.856 --> 02:46:54.496]  Paragraph.
[02:46:55.076 --> 02:46:59.277]  If you're not in the best shape, you're not in the best head.
[02:46:59.917 --> 02:47:03.378]  Now, let's put it all together because I'm a trend forecaster.
[02:47:04.375 --> 02:47:09.198]  And our system of tracking trends is making connections between different fields.
[02:47:12.779 --> 02:47:16.221]  If you're not in the best shape, you're not in the best head.
[02:47:17.142 --> 02:47:19.403]  And right now you have to be in the best shape of your life.
[02:47:20.904 --> 02:47:27.967]  We are going through a socio-economic and geopolitical crisis the likes of which we've never seen before.
[02:47:27.987 --> 02:47:28.047]  Hey!
[02:47:31.917 --> 02:47:42.481]  Could Washington have crossed the Delaware, the general fighting a real man that fought, not like little Obama or Biden or Trump.
[02:47:42.501 --> 02:47:44.462]  These guys would be real fighters out there.
[02:47:45.442 --> 02:47:48.403]  Or Clinton or Bushy Boy.
[02:47:48.423 --> 02:47:54.366]  Could he have crossed the Delaware looking like those people?
[02:47:55.466 --> 02:47:57.627]  Wait, how about Lloyd Austin, the current?
[02:47:58.484 --> 02:48:03.406]  The guy that's the Department of Defense, former General Lloyd Austin.
[02:48:04.086 --> 02:48:06.567]  Guys look like he's carrying a little bit extra weight.
[02:48:06.947 --> 02:48:10.068]  Washington on the Delaware going across those little boats.
[02:48:10.088 --> 02:48:11.288]  Those things are sunk!
[02:48:15.790 --> 02:48:17.210]  This is so important.
[02:48:21.032 --> 02:48:29.477]   If you're not in great shape, Then you're not thinking right.
[02:48:30.257 --> 02:48:31.418]  You can't fight the best.
[02:48:34.601 --> 02:48:35.361]  Diet force.
[02:48:36.702 --> 02:48:38.263]  Not in the best shape.
[02:48:39.304 --> 02:48:40.225]  Not in the best head.
[02:48:40.745 --> 02:48:42.026]  And this will help put you in both.
[02:48:43.287 --> 02:48:44.668]  So all things are connected.
[02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:49.151]  It's really important.
[02:48:49.591 --> 02:48:51.953]  Because we are in the fight for our lives.
[02:48:53.514 --> 02:48:55.756]  United we stand, divided we die.
[02:48:57.029 --> 02:48:58.889]  World War III has begun.
[02:49:02.950 --> 02:49:04.030]  Get this in your head.
[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:13.412]  If I asked Alex and the folks from Infowars to give me some weapons so I could go kill somebody, you're an accessory to the crime.
[02:49:14.532 --> 02:49:19.413]  The United States and NATO are doing all their accessories in the war against Russia.
[02:49:21.233 --> 02:49:26.014]  And you're hearing the crap coming out of their mouths about nuclear wars on both sides.
[02:49:28.234 --> 02:49:43.885]  And again, as we wrote in the Trends Journal, a study came out last week, or two weeks ago, a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States will begin a new ice age that will last for thousands of years.
[02:49:44.925 --> 02:49:50.609]  And remember, when all else fails, they take you to war, and the economy is failing.
[02:49:50.749 --> 02:49:55.813]  Again, World War II, Great Depression, dot-com bust, war on terror.
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:01.302]  Today, the Dow is up over 350 points.
[02:50:03.723 --> 02:50:07.345]  I just looked, when I took a break, it was down about 280 points.
[02:50:08.025 --> 02:50:08.365]  Down!
[02:50:10.026 --> 02:50:11.907]  It's artificially being propped up.
[02:50:14.248 --> 02:50:15.388]  It's a gangster ban.
[02:50:15.449 --> 02:50:17.810]  Oh, Celenti, you call get these wrong sometimes.
[02:50:17.830 --> 02:50:18.570]  Yeah, I get them wrong.
[02:50:19.470 --> 02:50:24.433]  Hey, they didn't teach me about zero interest rate policy or quantitative easing.
[02:50:25.299 --> 02:50:29.743]  In Economics 101, a graduate school, they made up this crap.
[02:50:31.544 --> 02:50:32.966]  Oh, they're gonna raise interest rates.
[02:50:33.006 --> 02:50:33.967]  What are you talking about?
[02:50:34.387 --> 02:50:39.051]  You got an inflation rate at 9.1%, according to John Williams' shadow stats, more like 20%.
[02:50:39.231 --> 02:50:43.735]  And they got, what, an overnight rate of 1.75?
[02:50:46.878 --> 02:50:47.738]  Who are you talking to?
[02:50:49.620 --> 02:50:53.023]  This thing's going down big, it's going down hard, it's going down heavy.
[02:50:53.982 --> 02:50:55.363]  We're doing all we can.
[02:50:55.743 --> 02:50:58.245]  If we don't unite for peace and freedom, we're done.
[02:50:58.765 --> 02:50:59.766]  Finito!
[02:51:00.306 --> 02:51:01.607]  Bye-bye!
[02:51:01.627 --> 02:51:07.690]  So, support InfoWars.
[02:51:07.810 --> 02:51:12.153]  InfoWarsStores.com and come to the rally.
[02:51:13.254 --> 02:51:15.675]  This Saturday starts at 2 p.m.
[02:51:16.496 --> 02:51:17.816]  in Kingston, New York.
[02:51:17.876 --> 02:51:19.257]  A Peace and Freedom Rally.
[02:51:21.112 --> 02:51:27.554]  Featuring myself, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Gary Null, Phil Giraldi, the Hot Damn Band, and others.
[02:51:27.894 --> 02:51:29.295]  We'll have vendors here, it's free.
[02:51:29.735 --> 02:51:31.875]  You come, you buy what you want, of course, but it's free.
[02:51:34.136 --> 02:51:36.517]  And if you can't make it, we're gonna be streaming live.
[02:51:37.937 --> 02:51:41.218]  And spread the word, that's the most important thing as well.
[02:51:42.019 --> 02:51:43.819]  OccupyPeace.com.
[02:51:44.359 --> 02:51:46.860]  OccupyPeace.com for the information.
[02:51:48.141 --> 02:51:49.041]  We need you there.
[02:51:50.185 --> 02:51:51.126]  We must unite.
[02:51:52.927 --> 02:51:55.229]  United we stand, divided we die.
[02:51:56.670 --> 02:52:01.313]  We have mentally ill people in control.
[02:52:01.333 --> 02:52:06.977]  They just got rid of that little freak up there in, over there in the UK.
[02:52:07.258 --> 02:52:11.701]  And they throw a couple of other letters in beginning with an F and a U in there, you know?
[02:52:12.682 --> 02:52:12.982]  Yeah.
[02:52:14.663 --> 02:52:16.725]  That's the freaks that are running and ruining us.
[02:52:16.765 --> 02:52:22.242]   So go to OccupyPeace.com Our freedom, peace and freedom rally.
[02:52:23.182 --> 02:52:24.323]  We need your support.
[02:52:25.423 --> 02:52:27.304]  And do what you can to donate.
[02:52:28.064 --> 02:52:29.164]  Whatever you can.
[02:52:31.225 --> 02:52:34.426]  Look, the oligarchs are taking over the world.
[02:52:35.306 --> 02:52:38.187]  You look at the election going on in Illinois for governor.
[02:52:38.868 --> 02:52:41.629]  All multi-millionaires and billionaires putting in the dough.
[02:52:42.049 --> 02:52:43.429]  Same thing in Wisconsin.
[02:52:43.669 --> 02:52:45.690]  Another little daddy's boy there running.
[02:52:46.457 --> 02:52:48.258]  Daddy's giving me the money.
[02:52:48.298 --> 02:52:49.659]  Daddy's giving me the money.
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:52.081]  We could outnumber them.
[02:52:52.101 --> 02:52:58.825]  We could outnumber them and beat them, but we only have to do it if we do it together.
[02:52:59.825 --> 02:53:02.347]  Again, united we stand, divided we die.
[02:53:03.227 --> 02:53:04.508]  Support InfoWars.
[02:53:04.628 --> 02:53:06.590]  InfoWarsStores.com.
[02:53:08.571 --> 02:53:09.972]  Go to it, get the products.

[02:53:17.088 --> 02:53:18.289]  TrendsJournal.com.

[02:53:21.191 --> 02:53:24.933]  So when you buy for $2 a week, if you want your money back, we'll give it back to you.
[02:53:25.333 --> 02:53:26.934]  No magazine like it in the world.
[02:53:27.294 --> 02:53:28.735]  Nothing comes close.
[02:53:29.636 --> 02:53:34.079]  And again, my favorite is the diet force because that's the force we need.
[02:53:35.039 --> 02:53:39.199]   If you're not in the best shape, you're not in the best head.
[02:53:39.199 --> 02:53:43.718]  (dramatic music)
[02:53:43.718 --> 02:53:54.558]   Preparewithalex.com hyperlinks to preparetoday.com which is run by our great affordable foods distributor
[02:53:54.558 --> 02:53:56.299]  and the great folks over there.
[02:53:56.299 --> 02:54:00.238]   And they have all the food and stock and the water filters and the air filters
[02:54:00.238 --> 02:54:04.499]   and all these other best selling survival and preparedness items, many of which
[02:54:04.499 --> 02:54:08.019]  the lowest price you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:54:06.249 --> 02:54:08.670]  Did you find something on there maybe lower in Amazon?
[02:54:08.690 --> 02:54:08.870]  Yeah.
[02:54:08.890 --> 02:54:09.971]  You want to support the New World Order?
[02:54:10.391 --> 02:54:12.452]  The point is almost all of its lowest price you're gonna find.
[02:54:12.472 --> 02:54:13.413]  It's all very competitive.
[02:54:13.773 --> 02:54:16.014]  Preparetoday.com, Preparetoday.com.
[02:54:16.554 --> 02:54:18.455]  It's all there ready to ship now.
[02:54:18.495 --> 02:54:19.636]  And this is how you beat inflation.
[02:54:19.916 --> 02:54:22.517]  You buy food now and as the price goes up, you save money.
[02:54:22.557 --> 02:54:23.758]  I told you this 30 months ago.
[02:54:24.078 --> 02:54:26.679]  Those of you who bought food then, boy were you smart.
[02:54:27.120 --> 02:54:28.240]  And it's only gonna go up anyway.
[02:54:28.300 --> 02:54:31.862]  So even if you waited or didn't do it, now is the time to stop procrastinating.
[02:54:32.122 --> 02:54:33.923]  Preparetoday.com and be smart.
[02:54:34.483 --> 02:54:39.818]   Separately, we Hold back items for people to sign up for auto-ship with the initial 10% off.
[02:54:40.338 --> 02:54:41.799]  And they overheld some stuff.
[02:54:41.819 --> 02:54:44.340]  So it's coming back in late July, they think.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.262]  Vitamineral Fusion, one of our best-selling products.
[02:54:46.542 --> 02:54:48.183]  High-quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids.
[02:54:48.583 --> 02:54:50.764]  So tasty, so great for children, adults, you name it.
[02:54:51.084 --> 02:54:52.705]  Put a scoop of it in water and some ice.
[02:54:53.105 --> 02:54:53.666]  Tastes amazing.
[02:54:54.346 --> 02:54:55.166]  Does so many great things.
[02:54:55.206 --> 02:54:59.387]  Because it's liquid, you absorb a lot more with the pills, even though they're high quality.
[02:54:59.427 --> 02:55:05.629]  We found 1,100 bottles of that, that because of a miscalculation with AutoShip we had, it'll sell out probably today.
[02:55:05.649 --> 02:55:11.590]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com as well, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:16.212]  And despite the fact that it'll sell out today, it's still 25% off.
[02:55:17.152 --> 02:55:20.873]  And I'm going to stop right there now, and I'm going to move back to your phone calls.
[02:55:20.933 --> 02:55:29.043]   Other than saying this, I talked to the National Citizens four weeks ago, five weeks ago, with I think the most important documentary ever, proving that they stole the election.
[02:55:30.384 --> 02:55:34.548]  And I said, I bet I'll buy 100,000 DVDs from you because people want to have it in their archive.
[02:55:34.608 --> 02:55:36.130]  And it's such a historic film.
[02:55:36.730 --> 02:55:37.091]  And we bought 20,000.
[02:55:37.651 --> 02:55:39.773]  And I said, I think we'll be reordering it every few weeks.
[02:55:40.514 --> 02:55:41.715]  We've only sold out half of these.
[02:55:42.396 --> 02:55:43.497]  And I'm not mad at the audience.
[02:55:43.917 --> 02:55:45.319]  I just think you're crazy.
[02:55:46.223 --> 02:55:48.224]  With all the censorship online, what's happening?
[02:55:48.264 --> 02:55:55.767]  You need this historic film on your shelf to show friends, family, neighbors, your office, your boss, your employees, your church, whoever.
[02:55:55.787 --> 02:55:56.988]  And so we have it.
[02:55:57.008 --> 02:55:59.589]  We have Covid Land 3, the shot, getting into how deadly the shot is.
[02:56:00.009 --> 02:56:01.210]  Both those are just coming together.
[02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:02.571]  Everybody needs them.
[02:56:02.911 --> 02:56:03.991]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:56:04.051 --> 02:56:07.033]  And I'll be quite frank, I'm surprised more people haven't got it.
[02:56:07.233 --> 02:56:11.675]  I think you're crazy if you're ever on the site getting other products to not get this, and it keeps the show on the air.
[02:56:12.076 --> 02:56:14.317]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
