[00:00.000 --> 00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going
[00:11.000 --> 00:20.000]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[00:20.000 --> 00:41.000]  In the Info War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:52.000]  We're going to have a great night tonight and for you people in Florida, we're going to have a gay night.
[00:52.000 --> 01:00.000]  Hi there, Governor Kate Brown here. In Oregon, we say gay. Oregonians are welcoming of our LGBTQIA
[01:00.000 --> 01:08.000]  community members. We want to make sure that Oregon is a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place for all.
[01:08.000 --> 01:16.000]  Gay, gay, gay, we're all going for gay, gay, gay, gay!
[01:16.000 --> 01:33.200]  We say
[01:33.200 --> 01:37.680]  We say, hey, we say, hey, we say, hey.
[01:37.680 --> 01:42.840]  We say, hey, we say, yeah, we say, hey, we say, hey.
[01:42.840 --> 01:45.920]  We say, hey, we say, hey.
[01:45.920 --> 01:48.420]  You think we're sinful?
[01:48.420 --> 01:50.540]  You fight against our rights.
[01:50.540 --> 01:52.500]  You say we all lead lives.
[01:52.500 --> 01:53.860]  You can't respect.
[01:53.860 --> 01:57.440]  We'll convert your children.
[01:57.440 --> 02:01.100]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[02:01.100 --> 02:02.060]  We're coming.
[02:02.060 --> 02:06.060]  We are bringing the new generation of Americans.
[02:06.060 --> 02:10.060]  We're coming for your children.
[02:10.060 --> 02:13.060]  We're coming for them.
[02:13.060 --> 02:16.060]  We're coming for your children.
[02:16.060 --> 02:21.060]  We're coming for your children.
[02:21.060 --> 02:26.060]  Your children will care about their needs and justice for others.
[02:26.060 --> 02:31.060]  Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers
[02:31.060 --> 02:35.060]  and soon they're almost certain.
[02:35.060 --> 02:39.060]  They were all excited, they all were happy about it and excited
[02:39.060 --> 02:41.060]  and giving me hugs and everything.
[02:41.060 --> 02:43.060]  I started young, right?
[02:45.060 --> 02:47.060]  Everyone can do that.
[02:47.060 --> 02:49.060]  Everyone can do that.
[02:49.060 --> 02:52.060]  Everyone can do that.
[02:52.060 --> 02:54.060]  But you don't have to worry.
[02:54.060 --> 02:57.060]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[02:57.060 --> 03:00.060]  Get on board and get ready.
[03:00.060 --> 03:03.060]  You should be in all ages thinking some people consider provocative.
[03:03.060 --> 03:05.060]  Get on board and get ready.
[03:05.060 --> 03:07.060]  There's nothing wrong with standing by our side.
[03:07.060 --> 03:10.060]  Get on board and get ready.
[03:10.060 --> 03:13.060]  Because the world always needs help and pride.
[03:13.060 --> 03:18.060]  Come on, try a little cry.
[03:18.060 --> 03:21.060]  We'll convert your children.
[03:21.060 --> 03:23.060]  Then we'll turn to you.
[03:23.060 --> 03:28.060]  Giving up the fear inside your screen like you never knew.
[03:28.060 --> 03:31.060]  Go and see San Francisco.
[03:31.060 --> 03:33.060]  Go and turn up that disco.
[03:33.060 --> 03:38.060]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[03:38.060 --> 03:42.060]  We'll convert your children.
[03:42.060 --> 03:47.060]  And make an ally of you yet.
[03:47.060 --> 03:52.060]  We'll make an ally of you yet.
[03:52.060 --> 03:59.060]  We'll make an ally of you yet.
[03:59.060 --> 04:02.060]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[04:02.060 --> 04:03.060]  Are you nervous?
[04:03.060 --> 04:04.060]  Yes.
[04:04.060 --> 04:05.060]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[04:05.060 --> 04:06.060]  No.
[04:06.060 --> 04:23.060]  The children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[04:23.060 --> 04:26.060]  Biological attack is imminent.
[04:26.060 --> 04:28.060]  It's going to happen.
[04:28.060 --> 04:32.060]  It's not a question of will it happen, but when it happens.
[04:32.060 --> 04:38.060]  Bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem.
[04:38.060 --> 04:43.060]  And the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[04:43.060 --> 04:50.060]  This is a biological warfare agent that had leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory.
[04:50.060 --> 05:03.060]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[05:03.060 --> 05:08.060]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[05:08.060 --> 05:16.060]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[05:16.060 --> 05:27.060]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[05:27.060 --> 05:35.060]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[05:35.060 --> 05:48.060]  It is powerful, witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future.
[05:48.060 --> 05:51.060]  Thanks to your support of this project.
[05:51.060 --> 06:06.060]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[06:21.060 --> 06:31.060]  And worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.060 --> 06:34.060]  It's Thursday.
[06:34.060 --> 06:42.060]  March 31st of the year is 2022.
[06:42.060 --> 06:49.060]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here with you today.
[06:49.060 --> 06:55.060]  All right, let me lay out exactly what's going on and unfolding and just let you hear some of these headlines.
[06:55.060 --> 06:57.060]  This mainstream news.
[06:57.060 --> 07:05.060]  California introduces new bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to seven days after birth.
[07:05.060 --> 07:07.060]  Remember that's already been going on for a long time.
[07:07.060 --> 07:09.060]  We told you about over a decade ago.
[07:09.060 --> 07:20.060]  Universities in the U.S. are delivered live babies after born who are kept alive for sometimes months in medical experiments and I'm not going to tell you what some of the perverts that work at these do the babies.
[07:20.060 --> 07:22.060]  I think you got a good idea.
[07:22.060 --> 07:24.060]  That's right.
[07:24.060 --> 07:28.060]  All right, continuing World Government Summit 2022.
[07:28.060 --> 07:38.060]  It's called World Government Summit run by the World Economic Forum has made a lot of really criminal announcements about cutting off the world energy supply and collapsing civilization.
[07:38.060 --> 07:41.060]  I've got a bunch of clips from that that I've reviewed.
[07:41.060 --> 07:52.060]  It is incredible, including robot dogs with loudspeakers patrolling the streets and letting all humans know they are obsolete and are not allowed out of their homes.
[07:52.060 --> 07:55.060]  Robot dogs with loudspeakers and forced Shanghai lockdown.
[07:55.060 --> 07:58.060]  That's promoted by these guys.
[07:58.060 --> 08:10.060]  Continuing Border Patrol rep warrants floodgates could totally bust open and will be overwhelmed by illegals, not just the two million coming across a month, but even more.
[08:10.060 --> 08:12.060]  You heard me right.
[08:12.060 --> 08:19.060]  Meanwhile, Samsung has banned the word Z or the letter Z and I told you that was coming next banning letters.
[08:19.060 --> 08:21.060]  So that's now banned.
[08:21.060 --> 08:23.060]  We've got so much to break down there.
[08:23.060 --> 08:32.060]  We've got a tiny slap on the wrist for Hillary Clinton, FEC slaps Clinton campaign DNC with fines over discredited Trump dossier.
[08:32.060 --> 08:45.060]  We also have an amazing moment with mainstream news going after Hunter Biden now and saying, oh, the laptop's real and he is a Chinese spy and he is a Russian spy.
[08:45.060 --> 08:49.060]  They're getting ready to get rid of Biden with that information.
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.060]  Biden has a plan to lower gas prices.
[08:52.060 --> 09:03.060]  It is to shut down more refineries, more pipelines, and to continue to block any new oil drilling or gas drilling in over two thirds of the United States.
[09:03.060 --> 09:09.060]  Isn't that just special while Putin signs decree ordering gas exports to be halted?
[09:09.060 --> 09:16.060]  The buyers don't buy in rubles, already giant gas shortages and rationing in Europe, particularly Germany.
[09:16.060 --> 09:23.060]  Biden responds by announcing an unprecedented in size and duration release of the U.S. oil reserves.
[09:23.060 --> 09:32.060]  Yes, run out our strategic oil reserves instead of letting people drill for oil and pump oil and deliver oil.
[09:32.060 --> 09:37.060]  And he's still got a moratorium on banks giving loans to oil companies to drill.
[09:37.060 --> 09:42.060]  That means only the big guys can drill and the wildcatters are cut out of the industry.
[09:42.060 --> 09:46.060]  This is total economic war against us at point blank range.
[09:46.060 --> 09:55.060]  Also big articles out on how Soros controls most cities and even most small towns now with his judges and district and county attorneys that rule.
[09:55.060 --> 09:57.060]  And believe me, I face these people.
[09:57.060 --> 09:59.060]  They are no their criminals.
[09:59.060 --> 10:01.060]  They know they're prosecuting a war against the American people.
[10:01.060 --> 10:09.060]  And there is no due process for Christians, conservatives, gun owners, veterans, anyone that's basically not a pedophile, loving devil worship.
[10:09.060 --> 10:13.060]  We've got that information for you as well.
[10:13.060 --> 10:19.060]  There is so much to break down in this transmission today.
[10:19.060 --> 10:21.060]  They also have a bunch of January 6 news.
[10:21.060 --> 10:31.060]  The Justice Department has officially come out and said they're planning for political stunt by May 20 to up charges on many of the January 6 people and a whole bunch of new charges.
[10:31.060 --> 10:37.060]  Well, we already know that because they called us up last week, the Justice Department, not the Jan 6 committee, and said,
[10:37.060 --> 10:39.060]  We want to talk to you.
[10:39.060 --> 10:42.060]  And if you don't, we just might up charges on our own shroyer.
[10:42.060 --> 10:47.060]  So just total mafia, total gangster talking about what we've been totally truthful.
[10:47.060 --> 10:49.060]  We didn't know that was going to happen that day.
[10:49.060 --> 10:51.060]  Everybody knows that we tried to stop it.
[10:51.060 --> 10:52.060]  We don't have a motive.
[10:52.060 --> 10:54.060]  I wasn't talking to Trump.
[10:54.060 --> 10:58.060]  Trump wasn't involved as much as I can tell either trying to get people to attack the Capitol.
[10:58.060 --> 11:04.060]  A bunch of people took it upon themselves and try to break in and strut around the way Democrats have done to many other capitals many other times.
[11:04.060 --> 11:07.060]  They didn't burn down any cities. They weren't mostly peaceful.
[11:07.060 --> 11:12.060]  They didn't attack the federal courthouse in Portland, Oregon, 100 plus nights straight.
[11:12.060 --> 11:17.060]  But they some did break in and poop on the floor and drink Nancy Pelosi's beer.
[11:17.060 --> 11:22.060]  And they've been given long prison sentences, 700 plus people charged.
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.060]  We've got that information here in the twilight zone for you today.
[11:26.060 --> 11:29.060]  I mean, there is just so much going on, so much happening.
[11:29.060 --> 11:35.060]  And I can tell you that as the world economic system collapses, there's not long to turn this around.
[11:35.060 --> 11:45.060]  If we expose the world economic forum as the main mouthpiece of the globalist forces in BlackRock of doing this and explain how they're consolidating control and imploding things by design.
[11:45.060 --> 11:53.060]  We have all the graphs to show it to consolidate money and power to themselves and bring in a dystopia.
[11:53.060 --> 11:56.060]  We can expose this and stop it.
[11:56.060 --> 12:09.060]  And every person listening to the show, 99.99999% of you are going to have a much worse life and a much less safe life and a much less fulfilled life.
[12:09.060 --> 12:19.060]  And they're going to live in a very high tech police state grid that is just going to be terrible if you don't say no to this and reject it now.
[12:19.060 --> 12:26.060]  And with it comes all of these attacks on common sense and on logic and just the murder of that.
[12:26.060 --> 12:31.060]  Biden's executive order on transgender rights unilaterally eviscerates women's sports.
[12:31.060 --> 12:38.060]  And I have a whole stack on this and how it's tied to pedophilia and transhumanism coming up today.
[12:38.060 --> 12:40.060]  We're going to be hitting it all.
[12:40.060 --> 12:46.060]  We only have one guest on today, a great guest in the third hour that Paul Watson takes over in the fourth hour.
[12:46.060 --> 12:58.060]  But I'm going to be as judicious as I can today to try to hit all of this news in front of me because it's that important but also open the phones up some in the next hour.
[12:58.060 --> 13:04.060]  Separately, I've got some really good news for listeners and viewers about the Info War.
[13:04.060 --> 13:09.060]  It's kind of silly news and embarrassing for me, but it's still good news.
[13:09.060 --> 13:14.060]  We are having a lot of trouble making payroll and funding things to supply chain breakdowns with the supplements.
[13:14.060 --> 13:18.060]  We have to pay all in advance now with the companies. It takes up to 30 weeks to get stuff.
[13:18.060 --> 13:21.060]  We're not going to lower the quality so it's killing us.
[13:21.060 --> 13:25.060]  We used to sell enough supplements was our main thing to fund the operation.
[13:25.060 --> 13:29.060]  That's not the case now because most of our best sellers are out 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 months.
[13:29.060 --> 13:33.060]  So we had things like t-shirts over the years.
[13:33.060 --> 13:38.060]  We've had a few t-shirts that have been really hot and sold 100,000, 50,000 or so of one t-shirt.
[13:38.060 --> 13:41.060]  But most t-shirts end up selling a few thousand and that's it.
[13:41.060 --> 13:44.060]  And all the time I'm designing new t-shirts. Some are great, some are okay.
[13:44.060 --> 13:47.060]  But there's a lot of them. They're true Americana.
[13:47.060 --> 13:55.060]  So I spoke wrong yesterday when I said we had over 30,000 t-shirts and over 100 plus designs.
[13:55.060 --> 14:00.060]  We have over 200 designs and we have 63,000 t-shirts.
[14:00.060 --> 14:07.060]  And if I can just sell the t-shirts for what I bought them for, that will put $600 plus thousand in our coffers
[14:07.060 --> 14:11.060]  and we'll fix the undridges we've got for the next two, three months.
[14:11.060 --> 14:13.060]  So everybody heard me talk about this yesterday.
[14:13.060 --> 14:17.060]  We sold 1,000 t-shirts. Thank you at m4store.com.
[14:17.060 --> 14:22.060]  The problem is getting the 200 plus shirts up in one spot because they're all over the site spread out.
[14:22.060 --> 14:26.060]  And some we've got 100 of, some we've got 1,000 of.
[14:26.060 --> 14:33.060]  But there's over 200 shirts, 63,000 of them.
[14:33.060 --> 14:39.060]  Men's apparels, women's apparels. That's not counting the ball caps and the info or slags.
[14:39.060 --> 14:43.060]  So here's what's happening. They're going through right now and putting them all at cost.
[14:43.060 --> 14:47.060]  Some of us designer, some of the shirts cost us $5, some cost us $20.
[14:47.060 --> 14:50.060]  Whatever they cost us for the warehousing space is typically handling.
[14:50.060 --> 14:53.060]  We're going to put it on there. Most of them are already at cost.
[14:53.060 --> 14:56.060]  And that means ball caps, you name it, it's all there.
[14:56.060 --> 15:01.060]  This is a great way to get the word out. It's a great way to educate people.
[15:01.060 --> 15:04.060]  It's a great way to keep the show on the air.
[15:04.060 --> 15:06.060]  It's a great way to exercise your first amendment.
[15:06.060 --> 15:15.060]  We've got so many great pro-second amendment messages, anti-police state messages, anti-COVID tyranny messages, anti-Biden messages,
[15:15.060 --> 15:19.060]  anti-fellow reserve messages, pro-America messages.
[15:19.060 --> 15:22.060]  There are a lot of great shirts and things.
[15:22.060 --> 15:25.060]  And in long sleeve, short sleeve, you name it at m4store.com.
[15:25.060 --> 15:29.060]  Save the frog shirts that people love so much, the space for shirts.
[15:29.060 --> 15:31.060]  And here's the big announcement.
[15:31.060 --> 15:35.060]  We're selling out of all these and we're not going to make any of these ever again.
[15:35.060 --> 15:37.060]  And in the future, we'll have limited edition shirts.
[15:37.060 --> 15:40.060]  And then that's it here and there because I don't have the money for the inventory.
[15:40.060 --> 15:42.060]  And who knows, we'll even be here soon.
[15:42.060 --> 15:45.060]  So please go to m4store.com. Get a great deal.
[15:45.060 --> 15:48.060]  Keep us on air and get these amazing t-shirts.
[15:48.060 --> 15:50.060]  They're limited edition, most of which I've never even promoted.
[15:50.060 --> 15:52.060]  That's why they sit there in the warehouse.
[15:52.060 --> 15:59.060]  m4store.com blowout sale.
[15:59.060 --> 16:03.060]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[16:03.060 --> 16:08.060]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[16:08.060 --> 16:13.060]  Now, the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April,
[16:13.060 --> 16:16.060]  2022 is now being offered.
[16:16.060 --> 16:19.060]  And I believe it will sell out in just a few days again
[16:19.060 --> 16:22.060]  because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners
[16:22.060 --> 16:27.060]  want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.
[16:27.060 --> 16:34.060]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[16:34.060 --> 16:36.060]  It is powerful.

[20:20.060 --> 20:23.060]  Thank you again for joining us on this live Thursday,
[20:23.060 --> 20:24.060]  March 31.
[20:24.060 --> 20:26.060]  Worldwide broadcast.
[20:26.060 --> 20:28.060]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:28.060 --> 20:30.060]  Before I hit all this news
[20:30.060 --> 20:32.060]  that I mentioned earlier in more detail
[20:32.060 --> 20:34.060]  and a lot more I didn't even mention
[20:34.060 --> 20:36.060]  I want this to sink in for everybody
[20:36.060 --> 20:38.060]  and I'm not lecturing you
[20:38.060 --> 20:42.060]  I'm just reminding you and I'm reminding myself
[20:42.060 --> 20:45.060]  that if we don't understand
[20:45.060 --> 20:47.060]  this is an orchestrated global collapse
[20:47.060 --> 20:50.060]  I'm getting chills right now this is so serious
[20:50.060 --> 20:52.060]  if we don't get this message out
[20:52.060 --> 20:54.060]  and if we don't start reversing
[20:54.060 --> 20:56.060]  what the globalists are doing
[20:56.060 --> 20:58.060]  and making them back off
[21:01.060 --> 21:03.060]  it's not going to just be the third world
[21:03.060 --> 21:05.060]  that's starving to death
[21:05.060 --> 21:07.060]  it's going to be every major country in the world
[21:07.060 --> 21:10.060]  and again the globalists have civil war planned
[21:10.060 --> 21:12.060]  not just here but in many other countries
[21:12.060 --> 21:14.060]  during the collapse
[21:16.060 --> 21:18.060]  and that needs to sink into the people
[21:18.060 --> 21:20.060]  that are involved in the different government agencies
[21:20.060 --> 21:22.060]  and corporations
[21:22.060 --> 21:24.060]  that have been helping carry this out
[21:24.060 --> 21:26.060]  who are compartmentalized
[21:26.060 --> 21:28.060]  you need to get decompartmentalized
[21:28.060 --> 21:30.060]  and you need to listen to me and listen good
[21:30.060 --> 21:32.060]  because I have your best interest at heart
[21:32.060 --> 21:34.060]  because we all have joint interest here
[21:34.060 --> 21:36.060]  for civilization to exist
[21:36.060 --> 21:38.060]  and to continue on so please
[21:38.060 --> 21:40.060]  listen to me
[21:40.060 --> 21:42.060]  and I'm getting the biggest chills
[21:42.060 --> 21:44.060]  I've ever gotten on air because when I'm over the target
[21:44.060 --> 21:46.060]  the spirit tells you
[21:46.060 --> 21:48.060]  so listen to me very carefully
[21:48.060 --> 21:52.060]  here's the good news
[21:52.060 --> 21:55.060]  I have a bunch of indicators here
[21:55.060 --> 21:58.060]  and government and corporate policy
[21:58.060 --> 22:00.060]  in just the last 48 hours
[22:00.060 --> 22:02.060]  that's getting almost no attention
[22:04.060 --> 22:07.060]  that there are some sane people inside the system
[22:07.060 --> 22:10.060]  that are trying to put the brakes on the collapse
[22:10.060 --> 22:12.060]  but you've got the environmental
[22:12.060 --> 22:14.060]  transhumanist terrorists
[22:14.060 --> 22:16.060]  that have their operatives that have penetrated
[22:16.060 --> 22:18.060]  the major cabinets as Klaus Schwab bragged
[22:18.060 --> 22:21.060]  who are hell bent on collapsing civilization
[22:21.060 --> 22:23.060]  and they've got underground fortresses
[22:23.060 --> 22:26.060]  and redoubts and huge compounds
[22:26.060 --> 22:28.060]  and they really are James Bond villains
[22:28.060 --> 22:30.060]  remember James Bond villains are based on real people
[22:30.060 --> 22:32.060]  that Ian Fleming knew
[22:32.060 --> 22:34.060]  when he went to places like Bilderberg
[22:34.060 --> 22:36.060]  so when you see those movies
[22:36.060 --> 22:38.060]  and it seems like it's the real world
[22:38.060 --> 22:40.060]  it's because that's actually what's going on
[22:40.060 --> 22:42.060]  you've got governments and then you've got specter
[22:42.060 --> 22:44.060]  you've got Hydra
[22:44.060 --> 22:46.060]  you can call it whatever the hell you want
[22:46.060 --> 22:48.060]  but it's real
[22:48.060 --> 22:50.060]  G.I. Joe you know Cobra Commander
[22:50.060 --> 22:52.060]  he wears a mask
[22:52.060 --> 22:54.060]  he's really a corporate leader
[22:54.060 --> 22:56.060]  he's got royalty
[22:56.060 --> 22:58.060]  working for him out of the UK
[22:58.060 --> 23:00.060]  British Empire, Destro
[23:00.060 --> 23:02.060]  the writers of all these shows
[23:02.060 --> 23:04.060]  are telling you what's really going on
[23:04.060 --> 23:06.060]  you understand that
[23:06.060 --> 23:08.060]  well I don't work for Cobra
[23:08.060 --> 23:10.060]  I work for humanity
[23:10.060 --> 23:12.060]  and America and freedom
[23:12.060 --> 23:14.060]  and it really comes down to that
[23:14.060 --> 23:16.060]  you work for the snake
[23:16.060 --> 23:18.060]  from the Bible, the devil
[23:18.060 --> 23:20.060]  are you on Cobra's team or are you on God's team
[23:20.060 --> 23:22.060]  you better decide right now
[23:22.060 --> 23:24.060]  okay let me give you the good news
[23:24.060 --> 23:26.060]  the United States quietly
[23:26.060 --> 23:28.060]  remove fertilizer
[23:28.060 --> 23:30.060]  off the list of banned items
[23:30.060 --> 23:32.060]  and the European Union
[23:32.060 --> 23:34.060]  is moving to do the same
[23:34.060 --> 23:36.060]  because if you don't do that
[23:36.060 --> 23:38.060]  it will kill
[23:38.060 --> 23:40.060]  upwards of a billion people
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.060]  in the next two years
[23:42.060 --> 23:44.060]  and cause a chain reaction
[23:44.060 --> 23:46.060]  the supply chain is always a year out
[23:46.060 --> 23:48.060]  with fertilizer
[23:48.060 --> 23:50.060]  already it's going to kill
[23:50.060 --> 23:52.060]  probably a hundred million people what's happened
[23:52.060 --> 23:54.060]  and again
[23:54.060 --> 23:56.060]  do you feel safe while this is going on
[23:56.060 --> 23:58.060]  deliberately?
[23:58.060 --> 24:00.060]  seriously
[24:00.060 --> 24:02.060]  while we're debating transgender sports
[24:02.060 --> 24:04.060]  the border is completely wide open
[24:04.060 --> 24:06.060]  and
[24:08.060 --> 24:10.060]  we're all in grave danger here
[24:10.060 --> 24:12.060]  and I've got a bunch of other indicators here
[24:12.060 --> 24:14.060]  that some sanity is kicking in
[24:14.060 --> 24:16.060]  but we need
[24:16.060 --> 24:18.060]  an emergency
[24:18.060 --> 24:20.060]  hearings in Congress we need
[24:20.060 --> 24:22.060]  the Keystone Pipeline turned on
[24:22.060 --> 24:24.060]  we need those 2000 plus other ones turn on now
[24:24.060 --> 24:26.060]  turn them on now
[24:28.060 --> 24:30.060]  but again oh we're in a transition
[24:30.060 --> 24:32.060]  away from fossil fuels
[24:32.060 --> 24:34.060]  no we're in a transition
[24:34.060 --> 24:36.060]  away from civilization
[24:36.060 --> 24:38.060]  and I've got
[24:38.060 --> 24:40.060]  three stacks on this right here
[24:42.060 --> 24:44.060]  so anybody that
[24:44.060 --> 24:46.060]  goes along with the energy shut off
[24:46.060 --> 24:48.060]  is responsible for killing
[24:48.060 --> 24:50.060]  starving to death hundreds
[24:50.060 --> 24:52.060]  of millions of people and they actually
[24:52.060 --> 24:54.060]  know that and the left likes it
[24:54.060 --> 24:56.060]  they want to exterminate people and they don't like
[24:56.060 --> 24:58.060]  Latin Americans and they don't like Africans
[24:58.060 --> 25:00.060]  and they don't like people in the Middle East
[25:00.060 --> 25:02.060]  and they don't like poor people in Asia
[25:02.060 --> 25:04.060]  the left of course will say yeah there's
[25:04.060 --> 25:06.060]  so many people well then you know what
[25:06.060 --> 25:08.060]  you need to die
[25:08.060 --> 25:10.060]  not all these other people
[25:10.060 --> 25:12.060]  that they also are starving and brainwashing
[25:12.060 --> 25:14.060]  and taking some that survive
[25:14.060 --> 25:16.060]  and throwing them at us as weapons
[25:16.060 --> 25:18.060]  to collapse us
[25:18.060 --> 25:20.060]  so we got to play chess instead of checkers
[25:20.060 --> 25:22.060]  doesn't mean we're for open borders doesn't mean
[25:22.060 --> 25:24.060]  the UN that cuts off the food and does the
[25:24.060 --> 25:26.060]  lockdowns and goes along with these
[25:26.060 --> 25:28.060]  policies then says oh look everybody
[25:28.060 --> 25:30.060]  starving in Africa give us billions
[25:30.060 --> 25:32.060]  of dollars and then none of it goes
[25:32.060 --> 25:34.060]  to the starving people
[25:34.060 --> 25:36.060]  they keep them poor, they keep them
[25:36.060 --> 25:38.060]  uneducated to control them and now
[25:38.060 --> 25:40.060]  the same policies used
[25:40.060 --> 25:42.060]  to control third world populations
[25:42.060 --> 25:44.060]  are being brought here to be used
[25:44.060 --> 25:46.060]  against us
[25:48.060 --> 25:50.060]  explain something again
[25:50.060 --> 25:52.060]  for new listeners
[25:52.060 --> 25:54.060]  when fertilizer prices
[25:54.060 --> 25:56.060]  go full on average
[25:56.060 --> 25:58.060]  and the average person in the third world
[25:58.060 --> 26:00.060]  is living on two dollars a day
[26:00.060 --> 26:02.060]  some are living on a dollar
[26:02.060 --> 26:04.060]  or less
[26:04.060 --> 26:06.060]  when food prices go up even 10-15%
[26:06.060 --> 26:08.060]  they starve
[26:08.060 --> 26:10.060]  and start rioting
[26:10.060 --> 26:12.060]  they have grafts on this
[26:12.060 --> 26:14.060]  they've already gone up way more than that
[26:14.060 --> 26:16.060]  and they're set to double the food prices
[26:16.060 --> 26:18.060]  in the next year we're talking hell
[26:18.060 --> 26:20.060]  has already been released
[26:20.060 --> 26:22.060]  and if they continue to keep the
[26:22.060 --> 26:24.060]  fertilizer shut off
[26:24.060 --> 26:26.060]  and the petrochemicals
[26:26.060 --> 26:28.060]  one billion dead within two years
[26:28.060 --> 26:30.060]  one
[26:30.060 --> 26:32.060]  billion people
[26:32.060 --> 26:34.060]  the greatest war crime using economic
[26:34.060 --> 26:36.060]  weaponry the world has ever seen
[26:36.060 --> 26:38.060]  hey folks are we really going to go along
[26:38.060 --> 26:40.060]  with this
[26:40.060 --> 26:42.060]  now I'm going to tell you something else
[26:42.060 --> 26:44.060]  I want you to listen to me very very carefully
[26:44.060 --> 26:46.060]  we got 222 days
[26:46.060 --> 26:48.060]  from the midterms the deep state
[26:48.060 --> 26:50.060]  democrats are running 100%
[26:50.060 --> 26:52.060]  on terror attacks that are going to be launched
[26:52.060 --> 26:54.060]  by Trump supporters
[26:54.060 --> 26:56.060]  of course Trump supporters are not really going to launch terror attacks
[26:56.060 --> 26:58.060]  Trump's going to be blamed
[27:02.060 --> 27:04.060]  Tucker Carlson's going to be blamed
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.060]  I'm going to be blamed
[27:06.060 --> 27:08.060]  Joe Rogan is going to be blamed
[27:08.060 --> 27:10.060]  and I've already told all these people
[27:10.060 --> 27:12.060]  this is going to happen a year ago
[27:12.060 --> 27:14.060]  now people are calling me going oh you're right
[27:14.060 --> 27:16.060]  wow
[27:16.060 --> 27:18.060]  yeah
[27:18.060 --> 27:20.060]  there's a lot of work times today
[27:20.060 --> 27:22.060]  say
[27:22.060 --> 27:24.060]  that they want to arrest and have a plan to arrest
[27:24.060 --> 27:26.060]  Trump and his supporters
[27:26.060 --> 27:28.060]  and say we're all a terrorist group
[27:28.060 --> 27:30.060]  and that they've had a bunch of prosecutors
[27:30.060 --> 27:32.060]  quit in the justice department
[27:32.060 --> 27:34.060]  because they know there's no evidence
[27:34.060 --> 27:36.060]  so they're just replacing them with people
[27:36.060 --> 27:38.060]  that will indict
[27:38.060 --> 27:40.060]  yours truly and others
[27:40.060 --> 27:42.060]  so when I tell you it's two minutes to midnight ladies and gentlemen
[27:42.060 --> 27:44.060]  it is people say wow you've got a lot of courage
[27:44.060 --> 27:46.060]  Jones not backing down
[27:46.060 --> 27:48.060]  including any federal prosecutors that go along with this
[27:48.060 --> 27:50.060]  the country's gone
[27:50.060 --> 27:52.060]  the whole world's collapsing
[27:52.060 --> 27:54.060]  what do you think is going on here
[27:54.060 --> 27:56.060]  this is a designed implosion
[27:56.060 --> 27:58.060]  of civilization
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.060]  all the selling out before might have gotten some people ahead
[28:00.060 --> 28:02.060]  now the rugs being pulled out
[28:02.060 --> 28:04.060]  from everybody's feet and it's the post
[28:04.060 --> 28:06.060]  industrial world it's the forced
[28:06.060 --> 28:08.060]  the population that's why AOC
[28:08.060 --> 28:10.060]  and all of them are back on the news saying
[28:10.060 --> 28:12.060]  the world ends in 2030
[28:12.060 --> 28:14.060]  why are they all saying we'll all be dead by 2030
[28:14.060 --> 28:16.060]  because they're implementing something
[28:16.060 --> 28:18.060]  blaming it on global warming
[28:18.060 --> 28:20.060]  when it's all institutions turning off
[28:20.060 --> 28:22.060]  the infrastructure that's causing this
[28:24.060 --> 28:26.060]  so you can pretend
[28:26.060 --> 28:28.060]  you're with the establishment you can pretend
[28:28.060 --> 28:30.060]  you're a judge with your black robes
[28:30.060 --> 28:32.060]  you're going along with the system
[28:32.060 --> 28:34.060]  you can pretend you're a leftist leader
[28:34.060 --> 28:36.060]  a bureaucrat but what you are is fools
[28:36.060 --> 28:38.060]  to sell out your birthright
[28:38.060 --> 28:40.060]  and destroy the social safety net
[28:40.060 --> 28:42.060]  and destroy the checks and balances
[28:42.060 --> 28:44.060]  and chivalry that have protected us
[28:44.060 --> 28:46.060]  all for hundreds of years
[28:46.060 --> 28:48.060]  the last vestiges
[28:48.060 --> 28:50.060]  of the Renaissance
[28:50.060 --> 28:52.060]  are being swept away as we sit here
[28:52.060 --> 28:54.060]  brace yourselves
[28:54.060 --> 29:12.060]  in December of 2021
[29:12.060 --> 29:32.060]  it is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[29:32.060 --> 29:34.060]  about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed
[29:34.060 --> 29:36.060]  with the blood of Patriots in Tyrants
[29:36.060 --> 29:38.060]  and more see the coin for yourself
[29:38.060 --> 29:40.060]  at 1776coin.com
[29:40.060 --> 29:46.140]  coin dot com. It's also at info or store dot com. It's amazing. There's only 10,000 of them.
[29:46.140 --> 29:50.780]  And as a founding member, we're able to stay on the air. We're planning something very,
[29:50.780 --> 29:55.740]  very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level. So get your new Tree of Liberty coin
[29:55.740 --> 30:01.100]  while you still can at 1776 coin dot com. You know, it's a fact. And I'm not bragging when I
[30:01.100 --> 30:07.660]  say it. It's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human liberty
[30:07.660 --> 30:15.260]  as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist anti human program.
[30:15.900 --> 30:23.100]  And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[30:23.100 --> 30:29.100]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them at info
[30:29.100 --> 30:34.860]  wars store dot com. And we are funded by listeners and viewers like you. And so now we need to support
[30:34.860 --> 30:40.300]  more than ever because this fight has intensified. Don't need me to tell you that at info wars
[30:40.300 --> 30:46.300]  store dot com. We've got 25 to 75% off across the board right now. Things have been sold out for a
[30:46.300 --> 30:52.220]  long time like info wars life, fizzy magnesium mix. That's so amazing. And our new immune support
[30:52.220 --> 30:58.540]  formula that's so critical. They're all available 25 to 75% off and info wars store dot com right
[30:58.540 --> 31:06.460]  down. Ladies and gentlemen, info wars store dot com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20
[31:06.460 --> 31:12.460]  year history. And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[31:12.460 --> 31:18.700]  the supply chains are broken down. And info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[31:18.700 --> 31:23.820]  and paying for operations. And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist
[31:23.820 --> 31:29.020]  making their main move in full wars. It's paradoxical is more popular than ever is reaching more
[31:29.020 --> 31:33.820]  people than ever despite the censorship. But because of cost increasing and having to run
[31:33.820 --> 31:38.700]  our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money.
[31:38.700 --> 31:45.420]  So listen up to 75% off info wars store dot com on things like amazing patriot t shirts that
[31:45.420 --> 31:51.420]  help spread the word and fund the operation on supplements on books on films, everything is

[32:54.220 --> 33:11.500]  reading a frontal assault on the lives of the NoWworld Order. It's Alex Jones.
[33:11.500 --> 33:26.220]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas Broadcasting Worldwide.
[33:26.220 --> 33:27.720]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:27.720 --> 33:35.740]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas Broadcasting Worldwide.
[33:35.740 --> 33:39.580]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[33:39.580 --> 33:48.340]  Okay, I've got the really sinister COVID-19 news, but it's just unbelievable.
[33:48.340 --> 33:52.060]  I've got to hit the stack, I'll do it in a moment.
[33:52.060 --> 33:59.300]  I need to hit the transgender transhumanist takeover stack because that ties in with this
[33:59.300 --> 34:05.700]  other key piece of news and I'm going to do that at the start of the hour, next hour.
[34:05.700 --> 34:13.580]  I want to hit the economic Pentagon, police state, George Soros, Klaus Schwab news, there's
[34:13.580 --> 34:18.700]  a big grouping of stories here that tie together, but let me give you a prelude to this first
[34:18.700 --> 34:23.500]  just so we can get an idea of what we're dealing with here.
[34:23.500 --> 34:30.540]  It was over 20 years ago that I first received documents and had guests on who were part
[34:30.540 --> 34:40.500]  of Christian organizations who had been warned by nurses, they knew, in California and New
[34:40.500 --> 34:49.180]  York, as well as Washington state, and they discovered that they were keeping babies alive
[34:49.180 --> 34:56.140]  and telling the mothers that were disabled or on drugs, mentally disabled, that, oh,
[34:56.140 --> 35:01.140]  their child died and that they were keeping them alive and then using them for medical
[35:01.140 --> 35:02.140]  experiments.
[35:02.140 --> 35:08.660]  Now, more than a decade ago, lawsuits came out and documents were received by groups
[35:08.660 --> 35:16.340]  all over the country and we've discovered basically all 50 states are doing it.
[35:16.340 --> 35:25.700]  The latest documents last year were out of a Cleveland and the big hospital system there
[35:25.700 --> 35:30.860]  was keeping babies alive indefinitely and then doing experiments on them.
[35:30.860 --> 35:34.860]  So the left's all upset about lab rats and things and monkeys, and I certainly don't
[35:34.860 --> 35:41.580]  want higher level primates being experimented on, we need empathy and we do need basic humanity
[35:41.580 --> 35:47.020]  here, extended to animals, but where are the people for children?
[35:47.020 --> 35:48.020]  Where's the left?
[35:48.020 --> 35:52.420]  Because it's the left pushing this and in San Francisco, you'll remember, five years
[35:52.420 --> 35:59.100]  ago, the pro-life group infiltrated these organizations and actually got them to admit
[35:59.100 --> 36:06.180]  on tape that they could deliver them live babies for harvesting and the federal judge
[36:06.180 --> 36:13.140]  out there find the pro-life group tens of millions of dollars and shut them down.
[36:13.140 --> 36:17.500]  And last time I heard I was trying to put them in jail, so that's what these corrupt
[36:17.500 --> 36:23.820]  judges, they're not all corrupt but the Democratic Party ones are, that's what they can do.
[36:23.820 --> 36:27.260]  They can put you in prison for a misdemeanor, they can give you ten million dollar fines
[36:27.260 --> 36:32.220]  because there's no Eighth Amendment anymore.
[36:32.220 --> 36:35.140]  You see that being done to me right now.
[36:35.140 --> 36:40.140]  That's the end game of these people, judicial tyranny, but there's another judge that judges
[36:40.140 --> 36:50.060]  everything in all of creation and that's God.
[36:50.060 --> 36:55.300]  So those people doing this will pay for what they've done, but I want to just read you
[36:55.300 --> 37:01.820]  this article and it links to the bill for folks that can't believe this, I'm sure you've
[37:01.820 --> 37:06.820]  heard around the country, they've got bills to keep babies alive for two weeks, ten weeks,
[37:06.820 --> 37:08.380]  six weeks to then kill them.
[37:08.380 --> 37:13.220]  Well, here's another one in California, California reduces new bill that would allow mothers
[37:13.220 --> 37:18.620]  to kill their babies up to seven days after birth, and that's Peter Singer and Peter and
[37:18.620 --> 37:22.340]  all who have always pushed us to be able to kill babies.
[37:22.340 --> 37:27.940]  Up to three years of age is what actually Ezekiel Emanuel and all those guys push.
[37:27.940 --> 37:31.540]  After assaulting basic human rights for two years, California Governor Gavin Newsom is
[37:31.540 --> 37:38.100]  working on a new infanticide bill that would legalize the murder of children up to nine
[37:38.100 --> 37:42.180]  months of gestation and in the weeks after birth.
[37:42.180 --> 37:49.140]  The bill has been proposed by Newsom's Future of Abortion Council, which makes recommendations
[37:49.140 --> 37:55.500]  and strengthens to expand abortions in the state of California, and now they do not define
[37:55.500 --> 38:00.260]  it a baby until it has been outside the womb eight days.
[38:00.260 --> 38:04.820]  So they've already been doing this for a while, they've got to do a rearguard action because
[38:04.820 --> 38:10.940]  remember it was San Francisco where the Christians infiltrators, God bless them, got the video
[38:10.940 --> 38:13.300]  of all this.
[38:13.300 --> 38:18.900]  So that's why in Virginia they're trying to pass laws in New York they did to keep babies
[38:18.900 --> 38:22.780]  alive and sell their organs.
[38:22.780 --> 38:26.060]  They want to kill children one way or another and if they got to kill them once they're
[38:26.060 --> 38:29.660]  out of the womb or poison their minds or cut their genitals off, they'll take what they
[38:29.660 --> 38:34.420]  can get, but death is their favorite and that ties into the whole transgenderism and the
[38:34.420 --> 38:35.420]  rest of it.
[38:35.420 --> 38:40.380]  And I saw this meme, it's on inforwars.com, down in the cartoon section, and it really
[38:40.380 --> 38:42.260]  illustrates it all.
[38:42.260 --> 38:49.420]  It's Snow White leaning down the image of a 16-year-old virgin but becoming a woman,
[38:49.420 --> 38:53.500]  that powerful image, and she's talking as a mentor to an eight-year-old girl, and the
[38:53.500 --> 38:58.260]  eight-year-old girl's coming over and saying, meeting you as a dream come true and Snow
[38:58.260 --> 39:03.740]  White doesn't say, hey, let's go out in the forest and sing and talk to the birds and
[39:03.740 --> 39:12.820]  squirrels, she says, let's explore your sexuality, but instead it's a fat man in a wig telling
[39:12.820 --> 39:14.740]  the child, let's explore your sexuality.
[39:14.740 --> 39:19.700]  I mean, if I came into the house and my wife was sitting on the couch with my four-and-a-half-year-old
[39:19.700 --> 39:26.140]  daughter telling her about sex toys and how to put them in her body, I would divorce my
[39:26.140 --> 39:31.420]  wife instantly and I would fight like the devil that she had loose custody, of course
[39:31.420 --> 39:36.300]  she would never act like that or do that, but that's the woman that grew that child
[39:36.300 --> 39:40.140]  in her and loves that child, she would never do it, but that would be a deal breaker and
[39:40.140 --> 39:46.860]  end up, what husband out there, what wife out there, if you're a wife and you come home
[39:46.860 --> 39:53.860]  and your husband's on the couch or maybe reading stories at eight o'clock at night, you put
[39:53.860 --> 39:56.820]  your son or daughter to bed, your four or five-year-old son or daughter, that's how
[39:56.820 --> 40:01.300]  young they're doing this now, and you caught your husband talking to your daughter about
[40:01.300 --> 40:08.980]  explicit sex stuff that even if your wife isn't in the mood, she gets mad if you bring
[40:08.980 --> 40:15.380]  stuff up like that, and this is a child, you'd say, you're a pervert, you're grooming our
[40:15.380 --> 40:21.260]  daughter or our son, I'm divorcing you, but when they do this everywhere, they act like
[40:21.260 --> 40:28.100]  it's completely normal and good, it's disgusting, and it all ties into this, and look how far
[40:28.100 --> 40:32.460]  they've taken us with our tolerance, look how far, and of course they could even get
[40:32.460 --> 40:39.540]  a drag queen or one of these people that didn't look hideous, but they always get a big, fat,
[40:39.540 --> 40:48.020]  disgusting, scary as hell looking person to sit there and talk to the kids about the sex
[40:48.020 --> 40:54.020]  posing as a woman, hey kids, a woman's a big, fat, scary looking man with a beard and a
[40:54.020 --> 41:05.860]  red bozo, the clown outfit, ugh, and it's again, ladies and gentlemen, total grooming, total
[41:05.860 --> 41:12.660]  brainwashing, and we all know it, but the Supreme Court nominee, she doesn't know it,
[41:12.660 --> 41:18.020]  she's like, oh, I let this person out of jail, because they were 18 and the person they had
[41:18.020 --> 41:26.340]  sex with was in their age group, eight-year-old, eight-year-old, she's like, well, that's in
[41:26.340 --> 41:32.020]  their age group, these people are pedophiles and pedophile enablers, you don't get in the
[41:32.020 --> 41:40.260]  globalist club now, if you don't at least help them great children, if you don't feed
[41:40.260 --> 41:46.380]  the children into this, this hideousness, you know, you don't find it the clown in Stephen
[41:46.380 --> 41:52.980]  King movies, you know, and down in water culverts during a storm, no, no, they're all over the
[41:52.980 --> 41:57.140]  television, they're all over the media and they're with your children, get it off the
[41:57.140 --> 42:04.380]  screen please, and so they show you this hideousness and this obvious grooming and how sick it is
[42:04.380 --> 42:10.380]  and want you to accept it, and then it's all a globalist CIA program they experimented
[42:10.380 --> 42:18.300]  with in Germany, up to 30,000 children per state being delivered at age three to seven
[42:18.300 --> 42:24.980]  to pedophiles, to be raped into a same-sex relationship, to then be groomed and prepared
[42:24.980 --> 42:31.940]  to service adults in mass pedophile orgies at age seven, and they'd have medical treatment,
[42:31.940 --> 42:36.420]  they get raped so viciously, this is mainstream news, this is the left, this is who they are,
[42:36.420 --> 42:42.980]  they will murder you, they will kill you, they will annihilate you, they are Satanist, they
[42:42.980 --> 42:49.020]  are Legion, they are attacking, they are creating animal human clones, they're doing it all,
[42:49.020 --> 42:54.300]  they've got a breakaway civilization, they've already built, and they're about to feed seven
[42:54.300 --> 43:03.540]  billion of us into extermination and death.

[44:27.020 --> 44:33.300]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, they need all their
[44:33.300 --> 44:38.260]  propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because
[44:38.260 --> 44:44.220]  they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who
[44:44.220 --> 44:45.220]  is a loser.
[44:45.220 --> 44:49.300]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars on the air now more than ever,
[44:49.300 --> 44:53.420]  because even if you don't believe in god, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[44:53.420 --> 44:58.140]  up is safe handling and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[44:58.140 --> 44:59.140]  they just announced.
[44:59.140 --> 45:04.700]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying
[45:04.700 --> 45:10.020]  and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[45:10.020 --> 45:15.740]  And when it comes to information, boy is that true today, we see the entire global corrupt
[45:15.740 --> 45:23.700]  into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on
[45:23.700 --> 45:30.100]  their transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[45:30.100 --> 45:36.020]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lies, their COVID
[45:36.020 --> 45:42.140]  hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[45:42.140 --> 45:47.340]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[45:47.340 --> 45:49.380]  silenced and gas lit.
[45:49.380 --> 45:53.420]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence and that's
[45:53.420 --> 45:57.300]  why it's hard to share info wars links and band up video links.
[45:57.300 --> 46:00.380]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[46:00.380 --> 46:04.220]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com.
[46:04.220 --> 46:07.740]  We are so proud of info wars life immune support.

[46:19.740 --> 46:21.900]  top of it, it funds the info war.

[46:32.380 --> 46:39.740]  lowetium root and more, this product is incredible info wars immune support exclusively available
[46:39.740 --> 46:44.580]  at infowarstore.com is funding the tip of the spear, the info wars operation.
[46:44.580 --> 46:45.940]  It is a 360 win.
[46:45.940 --> 46:50.420]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[46:50.420 --> 46:53.020]  natural defenses and keep info wars on the air.
[46:53.020 --> 46:55.460]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[46:55.460 --> 47:01.020]  Take action now infowarstore.com.
[47:01.020 --> 47:22.500]  The final days of the republic, the final days of civilization as we've known it, countdown
[47:22.500 --> 47:29.020]  to 90% extermination of humanity.
[47:29.020 --> 47:36.580]  It's all official, I have stacks of mainstream news saying it's incredible, simultaneously
[47:36.580 --> 47:43.500]  the southern property law center, the ADL, liberal communist organizations will come
[47:43.500 --> 47:47.380]  out and say it's insane, none of what's happening, it's not going on, we're going to hit the
[47:47.380 --> 47:52.660]  world government news, the economic collapse news and how we can have a softer crash landing
[47:52.660 --> 47:53.900]  here in a moment.
[47:53.900 --> 48:01.180]  Speaking of crash landings, I don't want info wars to implode and so I have explained
[48:01.180 --> 48:05.900]  to listeners that because of supply chain breakdowns and 20 week and 30 week delivery
[48:05.900 --> 48:12.180]  of products that won't cut the quality of the supplements and all of it that we're not
[48:12.180 --> 48:15.460]  doing the storeable food right now because that's like a two month wait and we told you
[48:15.460 --> 48:19.980]  a while back, get it while you can get it on time and now it's sold out.
[48:19.980 --> 48:23.540]  So things are breaking down.
[48:23.540 --> 48:26.820]  And so we've been going through all our inventory and they've been telling me forever, hey we
[48:26.820 --> 48:29.940]  got a lot of t-shirts, you order them, you go up with new designs, but you don't promote
[48:29.940 --> 48:39.380]  them Jones, but I had no idea it was 63,000 t-shirts so it's bad news that I'm the business
[48:39.380 --> 48:43.460]  manager and I dropped the ball on some things because we can't keep the supplements in so
[48:43.460 --> 48:46.020]  it's hard to discount those.
[48:46.020 --> 48:50.820]  But the t-shirts we can absolutely do because these are all limited edition now and some
[48:50.820 --> 48:54.140]  of these are classics.
[48:54.140 --> 49:02.060]  They're all about to be history and unless they're in your closet or your drawer because
[49:02.060 --> 49:07.300]  they're all limited edition now, all 200 plus designs, every one we've got, they're all,
[49:07.300 --> 49:08.300]  that's it.
[49:08.300 --> 49:13.260]  We've got to get the funds in, we're selling them all at cost, InfoWars books, InfoWars
[49:13.260 --> 49:21.340]  films, all of it, got big deals on those, InfoWarsStores.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[49:21.340 --> 49:25.980]  And I guess they've come up with InfoWarsTeas.com, that's great, that takes you right to a subdomain
[49:25.980 --> 49:29.140]  of InfoWarsStore.com, so InfoWarsTeas.com.
[49:29.140 --> 49:38.020]  And then separately, we have the second and the three coin series that is the Founder
[49:38.020 --> 49:45.180]  Coins by patrickcollectibles.com, 1776coin.com, takes you right there.
[49:45.180 --> 49:50.700]  And this is helping put in infrastructure and keep us on the air unless stormtroopers
[49:50.700 --> 49:54.300]  blow all the doors off and arrest everybody in those nuclear war, which there's a very
[49:54.300 --> 49:55.300]  good chance of.
[49:55.300 --> 50:00.740]  So, but we're going to just keep on the deck in the fight and we're not going to evacuate,
[50:00.740 --> 50:04.740]  we're not going to abandon ships, so we need the funds plus it's a historic thing to have
[50:04.740 --> 50:10.420]  in your pocket, beautiful, designed silver coin by yours truly, the Tree of Liberty with
[50:10.420 --> 50:15.620]  the Thomas Jefferson quote on it, the blood of patriot and tyrants must refresh the Tree
[50:15.620 --> 50:17.260]  of Liberty from time to time.
[50:17.260 --> 50:22.020]  I'm very, very proud of it, we sold half of them in three and a half days and we need
[50:22.020 --> 50:24.700]  to get the rest of them out to get funds in now.
[50:24.700 --> 50:28.740]  So, I want to thank you all for doing this and if we're able to stay on air and able
[50:28.740 --> 50:33.140]  to get a reprieve and not have a total collapse of civilization right away, then we're going
[50:33.140 --> 50:36.300]  to launch some very special things for everybody that are founding members, if you put your
[50:36.300 --> 50:39.460]  email in when you purchase it, if you don't, then that means you just want to support us
[50:39.460 --> 50:45.700]  and have this historic memento, the truly an heirloom of the Revolutionary War against
[50:45.700 --> 50:51.940]  Satan, the Second American Revolution against tyranny, the Tree of Liberty coin part two
[50:51.940 --> 51:00.220]  in the 1776, three part series, you can also follow the link at the top of infowarstore.com
[51:00.220 --> 51:04.940]  or as I said, patriotcollectibles.com will also get you there.
[51:04.940 --> 51:09.220]  But I got to say, the last coin was powerful, this one is even more powerful, I mean it's
[51:09.220 --> 51:13.980]  just once you have it, once you see it, it's really something special and you'll know that
[51:13.980 --> 51:20.220]  you in America, in the world's darkest hour, double down to keep us on the air.
[51:20.220 --> 51:24.620]  We got a lot of stuff planned for people that are founding members, if we're even here in
[51:24.620 --> 51:29.500]  three, four, five, six months and I got to say, the only gamble is not supporting the
[51:29.500 --> 51:30.500]  info war now.
[51:30.500 --> 51:34.940]  Because even if we get shut down, I get killed or put in prison or whatever they're planning,
[51:34.940 --> 51:38.420]  what we've done is going to ring on throughout history and have a big effect and you'll have
[51:38.420 --> 51:40.500]  this coin and know that you helped.
[51:40.500 --> 51:45.060]  Well, I'm trouble setting up this whole operation, that's why they hit O and 2 because they want
[51:45.060 --> 51:46.060]  to get us both.
[51:46.060 --> 51:50.420]  But we got back up people and folks and Harrison Smith and others are doing a great job.
[51:50.420 --> 51:52.260]  So we're going to try to continue on.
[51:52.260 --> 51:56.780]  But again, the attack on us just lets you know that we're two minutes to midnight and that
[51:56.780 --> 52:03.620]  they're going to go after everybody, Tucker Carlson, Trump, anybody that's a populist,
[52:03.620 --> 52:07.180]  anybody that they can't control, anybody that's going to stand up against their evil, even
[52:07.180 --> 52:13.140]  verbally in the next phase, are going to get put in solitary confinement if we're lucky,
[52:13.140 --> 52:15.860]  probably most of us get stomped to death down in a dungeon.
[52:15.860 --> 52:16.860]  But that's okay.
[52:16.860 --> 52:17.860]  That won't last that long.
[52:17.860 --> 52:18.860]  It's all right.
[52:18.860 --> 52:21.700]  We're going to peacefully go forward and I'm going to be Christlike.
[52:21.700 --> 52:25.940]  I will not offensively go after any of these people and if they come, SWAT team want to
[52:25.940 --> 52:29.460]  kill me, I'm just going to get on my knees and tell Jesus I love them and because I'm
[52:29.460 --> 52:32.220]  not going to give them the fight they want, not because I'm a coward.
[52:32.220 --> 52:33.220]  It's the opposite.
[52:33.220 --> 52:36.700]  They're going to have to strike me down and that's going to be the way it is.
[52:36.700 --> 52:40.740]  But if they come and murder, suicide me and say, Jones killed himself and his wife or
[52:40.740 --> 52:42.900]  something, that's their favorite deal, that is a lie.
[52:42.900 --> 52:44.420]  I did not commit suicide.
[52:44.420 --> 52:46.140]  I did not kill my family.
[52:46.140 --> 52:47.140]  That is a lie.
[52:47.140 --> 52:52.340]  And you know they killed me and my family if they do that.
[52:52.340 --> 52:53.820]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[52:53.820 --> 52:55.100]  But it's okay, folks.
[52:55.100 --> 52:56.100]  I chose this.
[52:56.100 --> 52:59.540]  I want to fight these people politically, culturally, spiritually.
[52:59.540 --> 53:02.140]  I chose this path and I'm right where I want to be.
[53:02.140 --> 53:03.140]  That's what they always say.
[53:03.140 --> 53:05.860]  People get killed in the military and they're all crying at the funeral and they'll have
[53:05.860 --> 53:09.500]  the general get up there and say, well, I talked to him just a few weeks ago and he
[53:09.500 --> 53:12.700]  told me he was right where he wanted to be and that's exactly where I'm at.
[53:12.700 --> 53:14.300]  I'm right where I want to be.
[53:14.300 --> 53:18.780]  An opposition to the pedophiles, an opposition to the devil worshipers, an opposition to
[53:18.780 --> 53:22.420]  the New World Order, an opposition to the transhumanists, an opposition to the Uyghur
[53:22.420 --> 53:27.420]  death camps, an opposition to all of that saying I want to be with God.
[53:27.420 --> 53:28.660]  I want to be good.
[53:28.660 --> 53:30.100]  I want to be a good father.
[53:30.100 --> 53:31.500]  I want to be a good citizen.
[53:31.500 --> 53:32.980]  I want to be a wholesome person.
[53:32.980 --> 53:36.740]  I want to tell the truth and that's what I've done.
[53:36.740 --> 53:42.660]  They can lie about us and demonize us all day because they know we are the standard of
[53:42.660 --> 53:43.660]  resistance.
[53:43.660 --> 53:47.780]  Info wars is the best there's been in generations in the fight.
[53:47.780 --> 53:48.780]  Doesn't mean I'm on a power trip.
[53:48.780 --> 53:49.780]  Doesn't mean I'm great.
[53:49.780 --> 53:51.100]  Doesn't mean I got all the answers.
[53:51.100 --> 53:53.820]  But we are the best there is.
[53:53.820 --> 53:54.980]  We've done the best job.
[53:54.980 --> 53:59.140]  That means you, the listener and viewer, literally I'm not kissing your ass when I say that.
[53:59.140 --> 54:03.100]  You need to know what you've done with your word of mouth and your prayer and your support.
[54:03.100 --> 54:07.340]  You need to know the fact that you're tuned in out of the seven and a half billion people
[54:07.340 --> 54:08.340]  on this planet.
[54:08.340 --> 54:14.660]  The couple million of you tuned in right now are the vanguard, are the hope of our children
[54:14.660 --> 54:19.020]  and our future in the innocence being tortured and raped, begging for God to save them in
[54:19.020 --> 54:21.500]  those dungeons with those pedophiles.
[54:21.500 --> 54:25.920]  When they cry out to God, God sends out his spirit to us to give us the answers and the
[54:25.920 --> 54:28.380]  motivation to stop the Satanist.
[54:28.380 --> 54:31.780]  But if we don't take action, God is paralyzed.
[54:31.780 --> 54:37.700]  Not because God couldn't overwrite it, but because God needs us to be his instruments.
[54:37.700 --> 54:46.340]  Vengeance belongs to God, but God works through us and that is our job now to peacefully expose
[54:46.340 --> 54:50.900]  the enemy because they want a violent confrontation because they're spiritually losing.
[54:50.900 --> 54:51.900]  They're spiritual losers.
[54:51.900 --> 54:53.460]  They were always going to lose.
[54:53.460 --> 54:59.860]  They want to claw and take as many of us with them as they possibly can.
[54:59.860 --> 55:03.700]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[55:03.700 --> 55:08.900]  1776 coin will sell out part two at Liberty Tree and we need the funds to stay on air and
[55:08.900 --> 55:09.900]  be strong.
[55:09.900 --> 55:11.940]  I know these unprecedented attacks.
[55:11.940 --> 55:12.940]  Okay.
[55:12.940 --> 55:16.180]  Let me just catch my breath here because I'm really freaked out right now.
[55:16.180 --> 55:19.420]  I mean, I haven't scratched the surface on the news and I've already covered more stuff
[55:19.420 --> 55:21.860]  than anybody could ever probably even cover in 10 hours.
[55:21.860 --> 55:32.100]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, you understand, 10 states, 10 states have introduced legislation,
[55:32.100 --> 55:37.260]  several have passed it to keep babies alive for in some cases up to six weeks, others
[55:37.260 --> 55:40.980]  two weeks or seven days.
[55:40.980 --> 55:41.980]  Talk about mission creep.
[55:41.980 --> 55:42.980]  You talk about the inchworm.
[55:42.980 --> 55:43.980]  You talk about success approximation.
[55:43.980 --> 55:48.300]  You talk about the frog in the pot.
[55:48.300 --> 55:51.900]  I'm going to hit this when we come back and start the next hour, this entire stack of
[55:51.900 --> 55:54.700]  the attack on our children and what it really means and how it all ties together.
[55:54.700 --> 56:01.940]  And then I'm going to get into robot dogs with loudspeakers and forced Shanghai lockdown.
[56:01.940 --> 56:06.940]  Surprise and concern, poison control issues, nationwide toxic warning about COVID-19 rapid
[56:06.940 --> 56:07.940]  antigen test.
[56:07.940 --> 56:10.220]  If you ate one, it would kill you.
[56:10.220 --> 56:14.660]  It includes poisonous liquid substance used commonly in pest control.
[56:14.660 --> 56:17.260]  It'll kill you.
[56:17.260 --> 56:19.940]  HIV drugs may lower COVID risk.
[56:19.940 --> 56:20.940]  Oh, funny.
[56:20.940 --> 56:21.940]  COVID's like HIV.
[56:21.940 --> 56:25.940]  It is COVID and flu co-infection raises risk of severe illness.
[56:25.940 --> 56:26.940]  Death.
[56:26.940 --> 56:29.420]  Oh, they want to put everybody on HIV medication now.
[56:29.420 --> 56:34.540]  That was Fauci specialty in the eighties and nineties mainstream media vax people should
[56:34.540 --> 56:37.980]  take HIV drugs to lower their risk.
[56:37.980 --> 56:43.740]  Vaxed people, oh, funny, vaxed people need HIV medication now and now they're going to
[56:43.740 --> 56:45.540]  get sick for the rest of their lives.
[56:45.540 --> 56:54.100]  What'd I tell you, HIV drugs may lower risk, COVID and flu, co-infections, isn't that interesting?
[56:54.100 --> 56:57.020]  Isn't that funny?
[56:57.020 --> 56:59.740]  We've got some very, very interesting news of them cutting the power off.
[56:59.740 --> 57:01.220]  There's another one.
[57:01.220 --> 57:07.100]  FDA vaccine chief says all Americans will need fourth COVID-19 vaccine in the fall.
[57:07.100 --> 57:13.380]  Of course you will.
[57:13.380 --> 57:17.660]  They're already moving on to their sixth shot in Israel, fifth shot in Europe.
[57:17.660 --> 57:22.900]  And I only laugh because I did not cry.
[57:22.900 --> 57:26.660]  That's all coming up in the next hour.
[57:26.660 --> 57:32.300]  You think the border was open before Biden is signing orders to completely liquidate
[57:32.300 --> 57:33.740]  the southern border?
[57:33.740 --> 57:40.860]  But you, you've got to show it, vax pass if he had his way to buy or sell, yeah, yeah.
[57:40.860 --> 57:43.060]  We'll be right back in the second hour.
[57:43.060 --> 57:48.900]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[57:48.900 --> 57:57.180]  In December of 2021, Infowars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 anti-tyrant
[57:57.180 --> 57:58.180]  coin.
[57:58.180 --> 58:00.460]  And it sold out in 10 days.
[58:00.460 --> 58:04.980]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[58:04.980 --> 58:08.180]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[58:08.180 --> 58:13.740]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[58:13.740 --> 58:15.780]  out in 10 days again.
[58:15.780 --> 58:18.260]  It certainly needs to in front of operation.
[58:18.260 --> 58:23.300]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[58:23.300 --> 58:27.140]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots in Tyrants and more.
[58:27.140 --> 58:31.180]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[58:31.180 --> 58:33.420]  It's also at infowarsstore.com.
[58:33.420 --> 58:34.420]  It's amazing.
[58:34.420 --> 58:36.180]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[58:36.180 --> 58:39.740]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[58:39.740 --> 58:44.220]  very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[58:44.220 --> 58:49.180]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[58:49.180 --> 58:52.260]  Our world is so full of hype.
[58:52.260 --> 58:57.300]  We're force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media, by the controlled churches
[58:57.300 --> 58:58.300]  and the universities.
[58:58.300 --> 59:00.780]  And why is this the case?
[59:00.780 --> 59:05.740]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches,
[59:05.740 --> 59:06.740]  our own souls.
[59:06.740 --> 59:14.060]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[59:14.060 --> 59:19.460]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[59:19.460 --> 59:22.700]  change who we are are only lowering us.
[59:22.700 --> 59:23.700]  They're only making us more depressed.
[59:23.700 --> 59:25.700]  In the end, they're only making us less filled.
[59:25.700 --> 59:31.380]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[59:31.380 --> 59:32.380]  ourselves.
[59:32.380 --> 59:37.020]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[59:37.020 --> 59:41.940]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able
[59:41.940 --> 59:44.580]  to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[59:44.580 --> 59:50.380]  And that's where the incredible products come in at M4store.com.
[59:50.380 --> 1:00:00.380]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:00.380 --> 1:00:16.060]  Well, we're now entering the end game and a lot of people are going to choose to serve
[1:00:16.060 --> 1:00:18.740]  evil because they think it will get them out of this.
[1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:23.380]  I assure you, if you study history or current developments or just have any discernment,
[1:00:23.380 --> 1:00:29.500]  that serving evil is never a good idea and in the end, you always get destroyed in this
[1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:34.580]  life and at the next level.
[1:00:34.580 --> 1:00:39.260]  Some stations don't carry this segment, so next segment, I'm going to hit the pedophile
[1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:45.220]  coming on the closet stack that starts with killing babies after they're born.
[1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:51.540]  Mainstream news, Bill introduced in California, and you tell people this stuff and they just
[1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:52.540]  can't believe it.
[1:00:52.540 --> 1:00:54.500]  By the way, the bill's sponsored by the governor.
[1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:57.620]  He's brought the bill forward.
[1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:58.620]  And why not?
[1:00:58.620 --> 1:01:02.340]  They're going to make these babies transgender.
[1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:04.100]  They're going to go from living to dead.
[1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:06.860]  Oh, your baby identifies as dead now.
[1:01:06.860 --> 1:01:09.820]  That's actually what they say they go, we've made the decision not to resuscitate.
[1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:11.580]  Of course, the baby's totally alive.
[1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:15.980]  It's a technical bioethics term.
[1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:19.140]  Unbelievable.
[1:01:19.140 --> 1:01:23.060]  So we're going to be talking about that here in just a moment, but then we'll get into
[1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:25.620]  the economy and more.
[1:01:25.620 --> 1:01:27.940]  And oh, Roger Stone's going to pop in.
[1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:34.020]  He's got the whole Madison Cawthorne story inside scoop.
[1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:36.940]  And I talked to Cawthorne some of them on very, very soon.
[1:01:36.940 --> 1:01:44.220]  But the issue here is that he's not back down on the orgies and cocaine that they're having.
[1:01:44.220 --> 1:01:49.020]  Plus, it was in my stack yesterday, guys, and I forgot to pull it for today.
[1:01:49.020 --> 1:01:52.580]  Whatever you printed me yesterday morning, I asked for the LA Times thing about the gay
[1:01:52.580 --> 1:01:58.100]  orgies and the cocaine and the pedophilia in D.C. And just all those articles you printed
[1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:02.740]  yesterday, print those for me again, or good luck finding them in that two foot tall stack.
[1:02:02.740 --> 1:02:07.340]  I think I split them into a bunch of piles, but some of it's actually in this pile.
[1:02:07.340 --> 1:02:12.140]  But I mean, just look, look, you think I want to be up here all day talking about pedophilia?
[1:02:12.140 --> 1:02:15.300]  No, but that's what goes on rampant.
[1:02:15.300 --> 1:02:20.460]  By the way, that's another thing I've seen the left recycling, CNN, the Washington Post,
[1:02:20.460 --> 1:02:26.720]  all of them with the headline, Alex Jones sends child porn to Sandy Hook families.
[1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:31.340]  And they go, oh, look, it's always these conservatives that are so against pedophilia that are involved
[1:02:31.340 --> 1:02:32.340]  in it.
[1:02:32.340 --> 1:02:33.340]  Oh, really?
[1:02:33.340 --> 1:02:34.580]  Why am I not arrested?
[1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:39.540]  It was unopened email that they requested, sent by somebody, attacking me.
[1:02:39.540 --> 1:02:45.420]  And it was hidden links that they, their lawyers, knew to look for in a meta-stand and find
[1:02:45.420 --> 1:02:53.140]  and then put out headlines that I sent them child porn.
[1:02:53.140 --> 1:02:57.220]  The judge demands any email with Sandy Hook or all these other terms.
[1:02:57.220 --> 1:03:03.620]  We send them, well, it's just 80-something thousand emails, almost all of them unopened.
[1:03:03.620 --> 1:03:10.100]  They open it, they find this stuff, it's links to it, and then they say, I sent them that
[1:03:10.100 --> 1:03:12.180]  when they requested it and demanded it.
[1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:17.420]  And then the media runs this against me.
[1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:20.620]  I'm not the one that's attracted to children like you folks on the left, man.
[1:03:20.620 --> 1:03:23.940]  You damn devils.
[1:03:23.940 --> 1:03:26.220]  You people are just beyond evil.
[1:03:26.220 --> 1:03:29.420]  I mean, there's just no end to what they'll do.
[1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:36.500]  And we got this judge up in Connecticut, if you can call it that, this thing that has
[1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:41.100]  just cheated us every way, lied about it, said we didn't give them this, sanctioned us
[1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:42.860]  for not giving them the Sandy Hook marketing.
[1:03:42.860 --> 1:03:45.060]  It's like saying, give me the unicorn.
[1:03:45.060 --> 1:03:46.180]  Don't have one, lady.
[1:03:46.180 --> 1:03:49.060]  I know you got a, I know you got a leprechaun.
[1:03:49.060 --> 1:03:51.900]  And that was when she first started sanctioning us and defaulted us.
[1:03:51.900 --> 1:03:54.380]  And now when you're defaulted, you're not supposed to get deposed.
[1:03:54.380 --> 1:03:56.900]  But they've changed their depositions like eight times.
[1:03:56.900 --> 1:04:00.140]  I already did three depositions with the other Sandy Hook stuff and all these other ones
[1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:01.140]  myself.
[1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:02.660]  And so I go, hey, I'm not feeling well.
[1:04:02.660 --> 1:04:03.660]  I need to move it.
[1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:05.660]  Oh my God, we're going to arrest you.
[1:04:05.660 --> 1:04:07.700]  We're going to put you in jail.
[1:04:07.700 --> 1:04:12.940]  We're going to find you 25,000 the first day, 50,000 the next seven, you know, compounds
[1:04:12.940 --> 1:04:16.260]  every day to $1.6 million in the next week and a half.
[1:04:16.260 --> 1:04:20.940]  If I don't appear in Connecticut where she can clap the irons on me.
[1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:22.060]  So you know what?
[1:04:22.060 --> 1:04:26.020]  I'm going to go up there so they can clap their irons on me, whatever, because at least
[1:04:26.020 --> 1:04:27.020]  I'm a grown man.
[1:04:27.020 --> 1:04:28.020]  I know God.
[1:04:28.020 --> 1:04:33.140]  I'm not like some kid in these leftist dungeons, they're raping.
[1:04:33.140 --> 1:04:34.260]  People got God to deal with.
[1:04:34.260 --> 1:04:35.700]  That's all I can tell you.
[1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:40.020]  Oh, I'm not saying this judge or any lawyers or pedophiles.
[1:04:40.020 --> 1:04:46.100]  I'm just saying the news and the left promotes pedophilia while attacking the family and
[1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:50.300]  the Democratic Party itself just signed an executive order that will destroy women's
[1:04:50.300 --> 1:04:51.300]  sports.
[1:04:51.300 --> 1:04:52.300]  That's what I said.
[1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:53.300]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:53.300 --> 1:04:59.300]  Stay with us.
[1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:03.060]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[1:05:03.060 --> 1:05:07.700]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[1:05:07.700 --> 1:05:15.500]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:20.140]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and
[1:05:20.140 --> 1:05:25.100]  because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines
[1:05:25.100 --> 1:05:26.500]  of the fight against these tyrants.
[1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:34.220]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.
[1:05:34.220 --> 1:05:36.260]  It is powerful.
[1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:41.860]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[1:05:41.860 --> 1:05:47.660]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future.
[1:05:47.660 --> 1:05:49.860]  Thanks to your support of this project.
[1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:55.940]  Get a historic memento that helps keep info wars on the air and also gives you a real
[1:05:55.940 --> 1:06:11.420]  piece of history at 1776coin.com.
[1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:13.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:13.940 --> 1:06:22.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:06:22.300 --> 1:06:23.300]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:26.740]  Welcome to hour number two at the kickoff of hour number three.
[1:06:26.740 --> 1:06:34.340]  Roger Stone has exclusive information on Madison Cawthorne and his big exposure of what's
[1:06:34.340 --> 1:06:37.780]  now being called orgy gate.
[1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:46.460]  And despite what the corporate media has told you, Madison Cawthorne has not recanted that
[1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:49.820]  he was invited to orgy and cocaine parties.
[1:06:49.820 --> 1:06:54.420]  By the way, I've been invited to those by famous people.
[1:06:54.420 --> 1:06:55.420]  And I've said no.
[1:06:55.420 --> 1:07:03.300]  In fact, I've not just been invited to orgies in DC, which I have been years ago, and LA,
[1:07:03.300 --> 1:07:05.300]  which I declined.
[1:07:05.300 --> 1:07:14.220]  I have been invited to be in the Hellfire Club at one of the two most famous universities
[1:07:14.220 --> 1:07:15.220]  in the United Kingdom.
[1:07:15.220 --> 1:07:19.220]  You can figure out for yourself which one has the Hellfire Club under it.
[1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:22.460]  It's actually in the history books.
[1:07:22.460 --> 1:07:29.940]  But yeah, I've been invited to go and take part in satanic orgy with a bunch of hot hookers.
[1:07:29.940 --> 1:07:31.620]  So that's how real this is, folks.
[1:07:31.620 --> 1:07:36.100]  I was invited by, well, multiple times by very famous people.
[1:07:36.100 --> 1:07:41.020]  And then I even got my invitation a month in the mail later when they told me that.
[1:07:41.020 --> 1:07:47.260]  I got invited to the major university to speak at their famous speaking thing.
[1:07:47.260 --> 1:07:48.860]  That was for the real attack starter.
[1:07:48.860 --> 1:07:52.820]  This was about seven, eight years ago.
[1:07:52.820 --> 1:07:56.940]  I refused to take the invitation.
[1:07:56.940 --> 1:07:59.580]  They got really pissed.
[1:07:59.580 --> 1:08:02.220]  And I guess they've got my MO, and they've got a database on me.
[1:08:02.220 --> 1:08:07.100]  They know I'm a type of guy that, if I wanted to, I'm not intimidated by that stuff.
[1:08:07.100 --> 1:08:09.980]  My earlier years, I got fish and water.
[1:08:09.980 --> 1:08:17.020]  But obviously, I don't want to be compromised, I don't want to be in the caves, in the satanic
[1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:23.100]  orgy, but it's very, very real, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:23.100 --> 1:08:25.620]  And they'll have to always hear stuff like this in freak satanic, because they wish they
[1:08:25.620 --> 1:08:27.900]  could get in the elite groups themselves.
[1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:31.100]  I don't want to be in those elite groups, but you just look at everything we do.
[1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:34.220]  It's at the cutting edge of everything.
[1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:38.860]  And over the years, I've had a chance to have meetings with three different Bilderberg group
[1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:44.500]  members off record, and just had one few weeks ago.
[1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:47.940]  And I'm not going to talk about the gels of it, it was an off record meeting.
[1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:51.740]  But this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:08:51.740 --> 1:08:59.060]  And so, Mr. Cawthorne has a lot of courage doing what he did, because if you just were
[1:08:59.060 --> 1:09:06.060]  fusing to go to the orgies, which are just like Eyes Wide Shut, in houses that look
[1:09:06.060 --> 1:09:11.660]  just like that, I mean, they probably use the same house, big palatial Victorian style,
[1:09:11.660 --> 1:09:14.260]  French style houses.
[1:09:14.260 --> 1:09:19.740]  Before they've got famous caves in the U.K., where the Hellfire Club's been doing it.
[1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:23.900]  I mean, Benjamin Franklin, he was part of it, and he did a lot of good things and things,
[1:09:23.900 --> 1:09:25.260]  but he definitely was not a Christian.
[1:09:25.260 --> 1:09:26.260]  He got pretty wild.
[1:09:26.260 --> 1:09:29.660]  There's no evidence he ever killed any kids, but they did dig up a bunch of dead bodies
[1:09:29.660 --> 1:09:30.660]  of kids in his house.
[1:09:30.660 --> 1:09:32.260]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:33.260]  Oh, yeah.
[1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:39.260]  Probably not a good guy, actually, but a lot of stuff going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:09:39.260 --> 1:09:42.980]  Oh, you didn't know Benjamin Franklin had a bunch of dead bodies in his house, including
[1:09:42.980 --> 1:09:43.980]  children?
[1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:45.860]  You just know he died in London, right?
[1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:48.060]  I mean, you know that, right?
[1:09:48.060 --> 1:09:51.580]  You know he was famously part of the Hellfire Club that had orgies wearing a theater mask,
[1:09:51.580 --> 1:09:52.980]  just like you saw in Eyes Wide Shut.
[1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:57.460]  I mean, you know that, right?
[1:09:57.460 --> 1:10:02.220]  You know this is all very real, right, folks?
[1:10:02.220 --> 1:10:09.620]  So let's dive into where the rabbit hole goes.
[1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:13.620]  California introduces a new bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to seven
[1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:18.260]  days after birth, and a bunch of other states have done it as well, and New York passed
[1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:20.460]  it a couple years ago.
[1:10:20.460 --> 1:10:24.620]  Got that for you?
[1:10:24.620 --> 1:10:27.180]  That's how these people operate.
[1:10:27.180 --> 1:10:32.620]  And now Biden signs an executive order on transgender rights, unilaterally eviscerating
[1:10:32.620 --> 1:10:36.500]  women's sports, saying men can compete in any women's sport they want as long as they
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:41.260]  designate it, and they can have full testosterone and testicles.
[1:10:41.260 --> 1:10:47.500]  Instead of a woman gets caught shooting testosterone, she will be kicked out of any sport, but men
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:49.940]  can compete with their testicles.
[1:10:49.940 --> 1:10:59.500]  And then you got Beto, the creep master, the most disingenuous person I've ever seen
[1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:03.740]  in my life, out running around with his, don't mess with trans kids.
[1:11:03.740 --> 1:11:11.460]  I mean, don't mess with the children who they want to stunt and deform and destroy their
[1:11:11.460 --> 1:11:16.500]  future and destroy their naturally developed sexuality.
[1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:18.620]  That's the depopulation.
[1:11:18.620 --> 1:11:23.820]  Biden tears into political attacks on transgender children from bills across the nation.
[1:11:23.820 --> 1:11:28.540]  It's not a tax on children, it's a tax on the pervert pedophile creeps trying to screw
[1:11:28.540 --> 1:11:33.380]  up kids and trying to form not just a sexual relationship, but a bizarre biological relationship
[1:11:33.380 --> 1:11:37.860]  of deciding there's something else so they can put a note on that, have the state involved
[1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:42.780]  to take control of parental rights, that child's sexual development.
[1:11:42.780 --> 1:11:45.860]  That is so damn satanic.
[1:11:45.860 --> 1:11:54.620]  Joe Biden applauds transgenderism with launch of new X gender marker, 50,000 times petition
[1:11:54.620 --> 1:12:01.860]  for Disney to rehire James Gunn after he threw pedophile theme parties.
[1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:09.060]  Andy Mack, actor Stoney Westmoreland, fired by Disney Channel following arrest for planning
[1:12:09.060 --> 1:12:17.380]  liaison with 13-year-old, top Disney execs, talk about their not at all secret gay agenda
[1:12:17.380 --> 1:12:24.260]  for flooding shows with LGBTQA P characters and how they need to get access to those children,
[1:12:24.260 --> 1:12:27.860]  how they need to be able to talk to them about their sexual relationships.
[1:12:27.860 --> 1:12:33.100]  Imagine talking to a full grown adult like, walk up to a lady grocery store, hi, I'd like
[1:12:33.100 --> 1:12:37.660]  to talk about how you like to have sex, about what your gender is, get away from me pervert,
[1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:40.460]  that's private stuff.
[1:12:40.460 --> 1:12:47.660]  Disney president as mom of transgender and pansexual children, she wants diverse characters.
[1:12:47.660 --> 1:12:52.980]  Yes so the kids can all learn about how I'm a bondage person, well I'm somebody that's
[1:12:52.980 --> 1:12:57.100]  into amputating limbs, well I'm someone that's into this and that, I'm someone that likes
[1:12:57.100 --> 1:12:59.740]  to get gang banged and get HIV.
[1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:06.300]  Four Disney employees retired, judge among 108 arrested in human trafficking sting in
[1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:12.180]  central Florida, Polk County, Sheriff, you know, always got those judges in there don't
[1:13:12.180 --> 1:13:13.180]  you.
[1:13:13.180 --> 1:13:18.340]  Video, DeSantis accuses Disney of sexualizing kindergartners, well that's what they're doing,
[1:13:18.340 --> 1:13:24.140]  they want access to five-year-olds, they doesn't apologize, Elon Musk is right, he says, at
[1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:28.340]  its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary and hateful, it basically gives mean people
[1:13:28.340 --> 1:13:33.500]  a reason, it gives them a shield to be mean and cruel, an armored and false virtue, and
[1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:36.460]  that's what they do going after the kids, particularly.
[1:13:36.460 --> 1:13:42.980]  Teacher on MSNBC worries he can't discuss his love life with kindergartners anymore, it
[1:13:42.980 --> 1:13:48.620]  scares me that I am not going to be able to have these conversations with my children,
[1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:53.860]  I don't want to have to hide that my partner and I went paddle boarding this weekend, what
[1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:55.860]  the hell is that even mean?
[1:13:55.860 --> 1:13:59.460]  This little young lady, I forget her name, we didn't play her clip yesterday, find that
[1:13:59.460 --> 1:14:04.660]  in the list, her name for me, I want to play this lady when we get back, she was so powerful,
[1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:11.460]  breaking all this down, this lady right here, find that for me from yesterday please, I
[1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:14.580]  want to play that next segment, in fact find it, yeah we'll play it next segment.
[1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:20.340]  The future is gay, new survey reports that one in five Gen Z adults identify as LGBTQ,
[1:14:20.340 --> 1:14:28.500]  because they're told it's cool to do so, yep total recruiting, it's a gang folks, they've
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:34.660]  had different parties throughout history, well this is the sex cult, the kinky sex cult
[1:14:34.660 --> 1:14:39.420]  by the way, likes children, so that's a foul cult, public school indoctrination is real,
[1:14:39.420 --> 1:14:46.900]  fourth grade teacher in Austin told her peers, 63% of her class came out as LGBTQIA, yeah
[1:14:46.900 --> 1:14:52.780]  because she told them to, here's her actually saying it right here, that won't get censored
[1:14:52.780 --> 1:15:00.980]  off of Instagram, and it goes on and on and on and on, but what's bad, oh teaching a five
[1:15:00.980 --> 1:15:06.740]  year old how to get blowjobs is okay, but MSNBC piece claims health and fitness is the new
[1:15:06.740 --> 1:15:11.900]  gateway drug to far right and white people and groups of males and females together
[1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:15.300]  having fun being confident, you're not supposed to do that, you're supposed to look like one
[1:15:15.300 --> 1:15:21.860]  of the zombies that's gone under the whole LGBT thing, here's the actual article MSNBC,
[1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:28.980]  pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme, literally, yes ridicule the warning about
[1:15:28.980 --> 1:15:33.740]  fascist fitness, they don't want healthy good normal people that are confident, they want
[1:15:33.740 --> 1:15:38.340]  to totally control you, we're gonna come back with that clip though, we always just talking
[1:15:38.340 --> 1:15:42.860]  about it's amazing, I never got to this clip of Mark Dysher state too, we'll try to, you
[1:15:42.860 --> 1:15:45.900]  know what, we're not gonna try, we're gonna do that, we got all the grimmer party stuff
[1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:52.100]  in Austin, most hardcore stuff with Disney, caught running child sex rings and hiring
[1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:58.020]  directors that are convicted child molesters, it's all coming up, stay with us.
[1:15:58.020 --> 1:16:05.780]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three part series, the 1776 anti
[1:16:05.780 --> 1:16:12.380]  tyrant coin, and it sold out in 10 days, and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original,
[1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:17.580]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[1:16:17.580 --> 1:16:22.940]  Now the second coin, the Liberty tree coin is being offered, and it will probably sell
[1:16:22.940 --> 1:16:29.420]  out in 10 days again, it certainly needs to, the front of operation, it is so historic,
[1:16:29.420 --> 1:16:33.180]  and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson, about the tree of Liberty being refreshed
[1:16:33.180 --> 1:16:40.340]  with the blood of patriots and tyrants, and more, see the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com,
[1:16:40.340 --> 1:16:46.060]  it's also at infowarstore.com, it's amazing, there's only 10,000 of them, and as a founding
[1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:50.660]  member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something very, very special
[1:16:50.660 --> 1:16:54.780]  for everyone that helps us go to the next level, so get your new tree of Liberty coin
[1:16:54.780 --> 1:16:58.460]  while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[1:16:58.460 --> 1:17:02.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help, I need your help keeping Info Wars on the air
[1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:08.900]  and strong, I need your help making sure that our mission continues on, I was born for this,
[1:17:08.900 --> 1:17:13.380]  you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[1:17:13.380 --> 1:17:18.420]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost tens of millions
[1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:23.140]  of dollars, and now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're
[1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:29.300]  a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content
[1:17:29.300 --> 1:17:36.340]  free of charge, and because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22, Info Wars and
[1:17:36.340 --> 1:17:40.980]  Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human Liberty movement worldwide,
[1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:46.660]  but the expenses in Band-Width alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:17:46.660 --> 1:17:51.180]  of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in Info Wars history is going right now,
[1:17:51.180 --> 1:17:55.820]  the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting incredible products, and keep
[1:17:55.820 --> 1:17:58.420]  Info Wars as strong as ever.
[1:17:58.420 --> 1:18:02.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help, I need your help keeping Info Wars on the air
[1:18:02.540 --> 1:18:07.620]  and strong, I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:12.180]  I was born for this, you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now,
[1:18:12.180 --> 1:18:17.260]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming
[1:18:17.260 --> 1:18:21.260]  that cost tens of millions of dollars, and now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to
[1:18:21.260 --> 1:18:27.100]  10 million views a day, we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups
[1:18:27.100 --> 1:18:33.140]  to be able to post their content free of charge, and because it's become so successful, it's
[1:18:33.140 --> 1:18:35.140]  a catch-22.
[1:18:35.140 --> 1:18:39.860]  Info Wars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human Liberty
[1:18:39.860 --> 1:18:46.180]  movement worldwide, but the expenses in Band-Width alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds
[1:18:46.180 --> 1:18:50.180]  and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in Info Wars history is
[1:18:50.180 --> 1:18:55.580]  going right now, the mega-emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting incredible products,
[1:18:55.580 --> 1:18:58.020]  and keep Info Wars as strong as ever.
[1:18:58.020 --> 1:18:59.820]  So I did it.
[1:18:59.820 --> 1:19:01.980]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[1:19:01.980 --> 1:19:06.660]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer
[1:19:06.660 --> 1:19:08.660]  and thank goodness for infowarsstore.com.
[1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:14.860]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some Turbo Force to give me that energy I need to
[1:19:14.860 --> 1:19:15.860]  get going.
[1:19:15.860 --> 1:19:20.300]  You know, besides the energy, Turbo Force, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like
[1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:25.420]  vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained
[1:19:25.420 --> 1:19:29.020]  energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:34.980]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones' Soros, I have bad joints, thanks mom.
[1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:39.620]  So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation
[1:19:39.620 --> 1:19:42.020]  support and extra flexibility.
[1:19:42.020 --> 1:19:46.580]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[1:19:46.580 --> 1:19:51.300]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, Turbo Force, that can
[1:19:51.300 --> 1:19:55.740]  still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soros can keep you moving
[1:19:55.740 --> 1:19:59.740]  and feeling great at any age.
[1:19:59.740 --> 1:20:29.580]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:38.100]  He's a big Christian now, and he really is converted, and we love him, and we don't judge
[1:20:38.100 --> 1:20:39.100]  you.
[1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:42.340]  He's never into kids, they weren't into kids, but the wildest party he's ever reportedly
[1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:47.540]  with adults, and he's going to be joining us as he's saying what Madison Pothorn talks
[1:20:47.540 --> 1:20:52.020]  about is completely true, and the Republicans are trying to cover this up right now.
[1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:54.740]  I just say bring it all out, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:54.740 --> 1:20:58.900]  You know, I don't tell the stories I've told you on a routine basis, it's so wild, I never
[1:20:58.900 --> 1:21:01.700]  took part in it, but I was invited to it as well.
[1:21:01.700 --> 1:21:09.500]  I've been invited in New York, D.C., Los Angeles, and to the Hellfire Club at Oxford, so there
[1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:10.500]  you go.
[1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:12.940]  I said the name, okay.
[1:21:12.940 --> 1:21:13.940]  Let's go ahead.
[1:21:13.940 --> 1:21:18.860]  I was like, wow, Thomas Jefferson went to him, too, yeah, but I almost did it, but I
[1:21:18.860 --> 1:21:22.180]  didn't, folks, because I don't want to get caught up in that stuff.
[1:21:22.180 --> 1:21:25.180]  No way, because that's just the first level of it.
[1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:27.420]  Thank God Roger never got deeper into it.
[1:21:27.420 --> 1:21:29.420]  He's coming up.
[1:21:29.420 --> 1:21:30.580]  Right now, let me get to this clip.
[1:21:30.580 --> 1:21:38.460]  This is Morgan Zegers, who just really, really, really knocks it out of the park when it comes
[1:21:38.460 --> 1:21:40.940]  to who the Democrats are and what they're up to.
[1:21:40.940 --> 1:21:45.180]  What are they going to do when you say that the world's going to end in 10 years and the
[1:21:45.180 --> 1:21:49.660]  world is overpopulated, so to solve the problem, we can't be having as many kids?
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:52.740]  Just seeing the way that they connect all these issues in their minds makes me really
[1:21:52.740 --> 1:21:57.060]  worried, because in Communist China, they literally forced abortions onto anybody who
[1:21:57.060 --> 1:22:01.820]  had more than one child, and they forced sterilized all the women that dared to get pregnant.
[1:22:01.820 --> 1:22:06.500]  Women were secretly having their kids and then keeping the kids in little tents and barns
[1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:08.420]  on the countryside.
[1:22:08.420 --> 1:22:13.040]  This is not us freaking out and creating some hypothesis of what could happen.
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:16.860]  This is actually what leftist regimes do, especially when they start running out of resources.
[1:22:16.860 --> 1:22:20.820]  We now have the Biden food shortage coming, and this is a classic step after leftist policies
[1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.300]  destroy a country.
[1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:25.380]  After they had the famine in China, they had no resources, and it resulted in the one
[1:22:25.380 --> 1:22:26.740]  child policy.
[1:22:26.740 --> 1:22:30.940]  This is disturbing, leftism is evil, it's satanic, and I'm not surprised that all that
[1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:33.260]  now they're saying don't have kids.
[1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:38.060]  Absolutely, in fact, they don't have children, they want your children, they want to rape
[1:22:38.060 --> 1:22:41.340]  your children at the bottom of the pit, at the top of it.
[1:22:41.340 --> 1:22:45.500]  It's just all sexy and fun, and we're liberated and cool until you get in the cult, and then
[1:22:45.500 --> 1:22:49.700]  it gets a lot deeper and a lot more evil very, very quickly.
[1:22:49.700 --> 1:22:55.820]  Let's go ahead now and hear from Mark Dice, who said word for word what the trans-pedo
[1:22:55.820 --> 1:23:01.540]  people say at city councils around the U.S., because we've played them from Baton Rouge
[1:23:01.540 --> 1:23:05.420]  in Tampa, Florida, New York, and in Austin, Texas.
[1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:09.580]  We've played the clips here, you've seen them, where they say, I'm here to recruit kids,
[1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:14.380]  I'm going to teach them about this, I mean, it's crazy, and you read this stuff, they're
[1:23:14.380 --> 1:23:21.620]  teaching third graders how to shove sex toys in their rear ends, I mean, it's like, folks,
[1:23:21.620 --> 1:23:23.500]  I'm not joking.
[1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:29.740]  Mark Jocelyn Elders, the Surgeon General nominee under Clinton, that famously said, reach down
[1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:36.460]  and masturbate to babies, I mean, it's like, that's what they do in public, can you imagine
[1:23:36.460 --> 1:23:37.740]  who they really are?
[1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:42.700]  But I can't even tell you the rest of it that she said, even though she said it, I mean,
[1:23:42.700 --> 1:23:46.100]  and people are like, this is a family show, Alex, they're teaching children this, I got
[1:23:46.100 --> 1:23:49.980]  to talk about this stuff.
[1:23:49.980 --> 1:23:51.500]  Let's go ahead and go to Mark Dice.
[1:23:51.500 --> 1:23:55.540]  I love the green hair though, he looks very Joker-esque with it, here it is.
[1:23:55.540 --> 1:24:01.300]  Thank you, I'm Professor Mark Dice, I teach gender studies at California State University,
[1:24:01.300 --> 1:24:05.260]  and my colleagues and I across the country have been making tremendous progress in shattering
[1:24:05.260 --> 1:24:06.980]  the gender binary.
[1:24:06.980 --> 1:24:12.140]  We've introduced, as you know, a growing list of over 57 different gender identities, many
[1:24:12.140 --> 1:24:16.780]  people don't know which gender they want to be, it's an extremely creative process.
[1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:22.500]  The reason I'm here is obviously the college students, young adults, their minds still
[1:24:22.500 --> 1:24:28.260]  fairly malleable, but we've seen the don't say gay bill being passed in Florida, and
[1:24:28.260 --> 1:24:32.620]  if we're going to truly succeed in the New World Order, we're going to have to reach
[1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:38.780]  the younger children, and maybe on a local level we could start with introducing ordinances
[1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:45.140]  to ban even identifying anyone as a gender at all, and if we can stop referring to the
[1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:52.020]  children as just boys, girls, he's or she's, until they're old enough to decide, perhaps
[1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:57.660]  then we can complete the, I mean let's just be honest here, the Marxist revolution, we
[1:24:57.660 --> 1:25:01.980]  can get to the point where a lot of us can shed the label of the Democrat and just openly
[1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:05.020]  admit that we are Marxists.
[1:25:05.020 --> 1:25:07.940]  Repealing the First Amendment on a national level may be a little bit difficult, but we've
[1:25:07.940 --> 1:25:11.660]  seen surveys conducted on the Oceanside Pier that there are a lot of people that are willing
[1:25:11.660 --> 1:25:12.740]  to accept that.
[1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:18.700]  So we're just recommending the Bilderberg Group, Think Tank, some of our associates,
[1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:24.260]  World Economic Forum, are recommending that on local levels we prevent the gendering of
[1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:25.260]  children at all.
[1:25:25.260 --> 1:25:28.820]  As you know, children will believe virtually anything at a young age, they believe that
[1:25:28.820 --> 1:25:33.420]  a man in a red suit flies around and brings presents to them every Christmas, and if we
[1:25:33.420 --> 1:25:39.180]  can convince them that there is no such thing as gender, that boys can be girls, girls can
[1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:50.060]  be boys, that men can get pregnant, that women can have external genitals, penises, then
[1:25:50.060 --> 1:25:56.580]  I think that we'll be able to really succeed in what it is that we're trying to do here.
[1:25:56.580 --> 1:26:00.460]  We're going to have to start reaching the children on a younger level, and again, by
[1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:04.580]  the time a lot of these students reach college, many of them are set in their ways.
[1:26:04.580 --> 1:26:07.260]  Some of them are watching Tucker Carlson, other YouTubers.
[1:26:07.260 --> 1:26:08.260]  Thank you very much, sir.
[1:26:08.260 --> 1:26:09.260]  Thank you.
[1:26:09.260 --> 1:26:10.580]  For more, subscribe to the Mark Dice YouTube channel.
[1:26:10.580 --> 1:26:11.580]  That's it.
[1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:12.580]  Thank you.
[1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:13.580]  Thank you very much.
[1:26:13.580 --> 1:26:20.300]  So, it's just going on for a long time, but I've always told listeners, go to city councils,
[1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:25.460]  go to county commissions, go to school boards, because it just goes viral.
[1:26:25.460 --> 1:26:30.660]  This is the place to go, and okay, maybe just the city council and 5,000 people watching
[1:26:30.660 --> 1:26:34.180]  local cable see it, huge victory.
[1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:38.620]  But most of these end up going viral with millions of views, and I've got to put my money
[1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:39.620]  where my mouth is.
[1:26:39.620 --> 1:26:45.020]  I am going to create a new character called Peter Powell or something, and I guess I'm
[1:26:45.020 --> 1:26:49.540]  going to go down to city council, and I'll put a rainbow wig on or something, and I'm
[1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:51.900]  going to repeat real quotes these people put out.
[1:26:51.900 --> 1:26:57.900]  I'm going to say in the great words of Jocelyn Elders, we need to masturbate the babies.
[1:26:57.900 --> 1:27:00.580]  We need to reach down and grab their genitals and do it ourselves.
[1:27:00.580 --> 1:27:06.820]  Now, and it's hard to say that myself, but I'm going to be doing it as Peter or whatever
[1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:13.140]  the new character is going to be, but these are going to be real quotes of these creepozoics.
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:19.020]  It all goes back to Kinsey and these other psychologists and psychiatrists that literally
[1:27:19.020 --> 1:27:25.820]  were into pedophilia, Sigmund Freud, I mean, Sigmund Freud is on record, and just totally
[1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:29.460]  obsessed with children and sex and pooping his poop.
[1:27:29.460 --> 1:27:33.420]  I mean, and like, I hate to talk about these people, but when you actually read about these
[1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:38.260]  people, like Carl Jung was the universe and archetypes and beauty and all this truth and
[1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:42.580]  this awesome stuff, and then all the rest of the liberal psychologists and psychiatrists
[1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:47.460]  are obsessed with having sex with their 10-year-old nieces and eating poop.
[1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:48.460]  And that's who runs things.
[1:27:48.460 --> 1:27:55.380]  It's a cult of psychotic, unhappy, out-of-control garbage that beat us over the head to gotten
[1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:58.100]  rid of Christianity, so we don't need to get rid of our original sin now.
[1:27:58.100 --> 1:28:03.780]  We need to get rid of our original sin by doing what the left says and banning the word,
[1:28:03.780 --> 1:28:11.620]  the letter Z, or banning the word boy and girl and making everybody submit and censoring.
[1:28:11.620 --> 1:28:17.380]  That's the new loving liberal freedom is censorship and control and pedophilia and everything
[1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:18.380]  evil.
[1:28:18.380 --> 1:28:19.380]  So we're here talking about it.
[1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:20.880]  We've hammered this over the years.
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:23.420]  A lot of people have been asking the last few months, Jones, you're not talking much
[1:28:23.420 --> 1:28:24.420]  about this.
[1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:28.700]  You're sick of looking at it and researching it because there's so much of it, but now
[1:28:28.700 --> 1:28:36.020]  it's just exploded in its latest big push, which is not just men and women sports, but
[1:28:36.020 --> 1:28:40.940]  adults of any age being able to come to your door and, hey, I want to ask your five-year-old
[1:28:40.940 --> 1:28:41.940]  out on a date.
[1:28:41.940 --> 1:28:47.780]  They have emancipation, and you don't have anything right, and your child isn't yours.
[1:28:47.780 --> 1:28:48.780]  It's mine.
[1:28:48.780 --> 1:28:51.220]  Because if your children aren't yours, they're everybody else's.
[1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:55.340]  These people have a drive they will never stop until they've raped every child on earth
[1:28:55.340 --> 1:28:58.420]  and then cut their heads off.
[1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:06.700]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:09.980]  Coin, and it sold out in 10 days.
[1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:14.540]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:17.780]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[1:29:17.780 --> 1:29:23.300]  Now, the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin, is being offered, and it will probably sell
[1:29:23.300 --> 1:29:25.340]  out in 10 days again.
[1:29:25.340 --> 1:29:27.820]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:32.860]  It is so historic, and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[1:29:32.860 --> 1:29:36.700]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[1:29:36.700 --> 1:29:40.700]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[1:29:40.700 --> 1:29:42.980]  It's also at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:43.980]  It's amazing.
[1:29:43.980 --> 1:29:45.740]  There's only 10,000 of them.
[1:29:45.740 --> 1:29:49.300]  And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air, we're planning something
[1:29:49.300 --> 1:29:53.780]  very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.

[1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.260]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:06.900]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[1:30:06.900 --> 1:30:14.100]  Now the second coin, as we enter the last days of March into April, 2022, is now being
[1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:15.100]  offered.
[1:30:15.100 --> 1:30:19.340]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and
[1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:24.300]  because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines
[1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:25.740]  of the fight against these tyrants.
[1:30:25.740 --> 1:30:33.420]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree coin.

[1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:17.900]  living in a twilight zone.
[1:32:17.900 --> 1:32:20.580]  Alright Eric in New Hampshire, Eric thanks for calling go ahead.

[1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:50.500]  one for a few of you.
[1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:51.500]  Well it definitely works, it's no joke.
[1:32:51.500 --> 1:32:52.500]  Absolutely.
[1:32:52.500 --> 1:33:05.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:05.500 --> 1:33:18.500]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:29.900]  Humans are heating up the oceans, land and sea by burning fossil fuels.
[1:33:29.900 --> 1:33:36.540]  The world has to overcome not only the damage done to our economies and our societies by
[1:33:36.540 --> 1:33:51.220]  COVID-19, it also has to confront repercussions.
[1:33:51.220 --> 1:34:00.500]  Ladies and gentlemen if you're a radio listener, you're only picking up part of this, this
[1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:23.020]  is the WEF's latest release called the New World Order.
[1:34:23.020 --> 1:34:36.580]  We have to uphold our responsibility which we have towards the next generation.
[1:34:36.580 --> 1:34:41.740]  So that's the World Government Summit calling for a New World Order global government in
[1:34:41.740 --> 1:34:47.580]  Dubai going on right now and I spent a good hour this morning, I got up at 4 AM, got some
[1:34:47.580 --> 1:34:51.740]  coffee, started saw the M4s.com article about this, I've already been following it the last
[1:34:51.740 --> 1:34:56.060]  few days, but now it's in full swing and I sat there for over an hour watching clips
[1:34:56.060 --> 1:35:02.140]  of the conference and it is unbelievable, it's on Twitter and it is, we are going to
[1:35:02.140 --> 1:35:07.340]  cut off all the power and depopulate for the Earth, we are going to bring in New World
[1:35:07.340 --> 1:35:13.980]  Order, anyone speaking about the New World Order will be silenced, only those for New
[1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:19.860]  World Order and that's the mind control, world government's real when you're for it, but
[1:35:19.860 --> 1:35:26.180]  just a minute you don't want to live under it, well you're a bad person ladies and gentlemen
[1:35:26.180 --> 1:35:34.900]  and that ties us into the big headline for today's show, global financial collapse alert,
[1:35:34.900 --> 1:35:41.540]  world economic forum forces are systematically destabilizing every facet of civilization
[1:35:41.540 --> 1:35:48.740]  to implement a control collapse, we need more world government to stop the starving, we
[1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:56.060]  need more world government to stop the migrants, we need global digital control everywhere
[1:35:56.060 --> 1:36:04.100]  you do, we need to control you to save civilization and then later we must get rid of civilization,
[1:36:04.100 --> 1:36:09.020]  they're the ones publicly doing the policies that collapse everything and then they turn
[1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:15.140]  around as if they're the savers, it's all oxymoronic, but they've got all these global
[1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:21.100]  leaders, government, corporate, ecclesiastical, academic, all up there yes manning because
[1:36:21.100 --> 1:36:28.140]  they get paid off, it is something to behold and tell you they look scared, they look weasely,
[1:36:28.140 --> 1:36:32.940]  they look pathetic when you watch them, you're like this is who rules us, this is who's in
[1:36:32.940 --> 1:36:42.660]  control of us, that's the real temptation is you're like man I could take over a lot
[1:36:42.660 --> 1:36:46.100]  better than these people could if I wanted to be Dr. Evil, but see that's the Christ
[1:36:46.100 --> 1:36:51.200]  in us though, doesn't want us to do that, I mean the latest from Joe Biden, like he
[1:36:51.200 --> 1:36:56.660]  gets worse by the day, but the footage of him, maybe I should air that next, yeah there's
[1:36:56.660 --> 1:37:03.740]  two clips I've got, he's like yeah I'm here at this fake set, I don't know why I'm here
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:12.980]  and why I'm taking a fourth shot, but you know we need to protect the trans kids, I mean
[1:37:12.980 --> 1:37:23.340]  total and complete cuckoo land and she's wearing the damn mask, she's all vaccinated, she's
[1:37:23.340 --> 1:37:33.260]  all safe, oh but they now admit oh sorry the vaccines don't protect you, World Government
[1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:40.540]  Summit 2022 ask are we ready for the New World Order, Jamie White articles got all the links,
[1:37:40.540 --> 1:37:48.180]  it's incredible at info wars.com, I suggest you share that with people, and they go over
[1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:53.820]  how they've got to cut off the carbon which is what we live off of, and they go look oh
[1:37:53.820 --> 1:38:06.420]  ETA.gov, look how the US has cut coal by 60% since the year 2002, and look at that, and
[1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:10.580]  your power prices have doubled and tripled, and now the other systems can't supply it,
[1:38:10.580 --> 1:38:15.180]  coal is totally clean the way we burn it, look at that, oh but China and India have
[1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:31.700]  made zero percent cuts, zero, we have made 60 plus percent cuts, think we're open for
[1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:36.940]  business, you know what economic war is, to cut our main power source used to be 70%
[1:38:36.940 --> 1:38:51.620]  of our power, to cut it by 60% is devastating, and has nothing to do with the environment,
[1:38:51.620 --> 1:38:57.580]  oh look at the symbol they all wear, that's the Debo's group, Rainbow Swastika symbol,
[1:38:57.580 --> 1:39:12.100]  they all wear, that's their cult, that's their group, that's their operation, what a system,
[1:39:12.100 --> 1:39:16.420]  what a time, and look how sick and phantic they are, a lot of the tweets about it are
[1:39:16.420 --> 1:39:21.900]  like US bureaucrats, US bureaucrats sent this out, man I really feel cool, look at who's
[1:39:21.900 --> 1:39:27.740]  at this event, this is who I'm talking to, look at their license plates, and it's the
[1:39:27.740 --> 1:39:31.720]  king, and then it's two sons, so the license plates are number one, number two and number
[1:39:31.720 --> 1:39:42.700]  three, and so he's just oh look at the Mercedes G wagons, because let me tell you, they're
[1:39:42.700 --> 1:39:48.460]  not getting rid of their private jets or G wagons, it's yours going to starve to death,
[1:39:48.460 --> 1:39:52.700]  you got Tedros of the World Health Organization saying new bioweapons are coming, and they
[1:39:52.700 --> 1:40:01.780]  told you of disease X now, the more deadly weapon coming, then you all die, let's play
[1:40:01.780 --> 1:40:07.920]  this clip, this is an Australian senator, Alex Antic, walks into parliament and starts
[1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:14.340]  dropping absolute truth bombs about the world economic forum, and then we'll show you some
[1:40:14.340 --> 1:40:20.580]  of bumbling, some of bumbling Biden, but here's clip two, by Klaus Schwab, the world economic
[1:40:20.580 --> 1:40:26.380]  forum is steeped in authoritarianism and Marxist ideology, it's an ideology which is creeping
[1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:31.100]  into governments across the world, to quote Schwab himself when speaking about the Canadian
[1:40:31.100 --> 1:40:37.420]  parliament, we penetrate the cabinets, I know that half this cabinet, even more than half,
[1:40:37.420 --> 1:40:42.580]  are actually young global leaders of the world economic forum, it's true in Argentina, it's
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:47.660]  true in France, now with the president who is a young global leader, end quote, the world
[1:40:47.660 --> 1:40:52.460]  economic forum promotes globalist issues such as climate change, so called systemic racism
[1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:57.660]  and sexism and creating an online digital identity, however closer inspection reveals
[1:40:57.660 --> 1:41:01.940]  the world economic forum is an anti-capitalist, anti-free market organisation that seeks
[1:41:01.940 --> 1:41:07.580]  to subvert western values and political processes, and they are very organised and very well
[1:41:07.580 --> 1:41:13.740]  funded, their message is designed to appear harmless when in fact the ideology that underpins
[1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:18.180]  it is revolutionary and destructive, they train aspirational leaders in their ideology
[1:41:18.180 --> 1:41:23.460]  and help them make connections in spheres including politics, business and the arts,
[1:41:23.460 --> 1:41:27.740]  the world economic forum has consistently advocated for the harshest and most extreme
[1:41:27.740 --> 1:41:33.900]  COVID measures possible including lockdowns, mandatory vaccinations, vaccine passports
[1:41:33.900 --> 1:41:38.860]  and mask mandates despite these policies assaulting many of our basic liberties, at
[1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:45.420]  the centre of the world economic forum's ideology is stakeholder capitalism, essentially
[1:41:45.420 --> 1:41:50.300]  this is a theory that traditional free market capitalism ignores the dangers posed by climate
[1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:55.140]  change and so the government must enforce restrictive policies to save the environment
[1:41:55.140 --> 1:42:01.380]  even if that means less wealth, why then are the forums, criticisms of capitalism always
[1:42:01.380 --> 1:42:05.900]  directed at western nations rather than the great polluters such as China and India, the
[1:42:05.900 --> 1:42:09.860]  forum believes that your freedoms should be minimised to prevent the imminent climate
[1:42:09.860 --> 1:42:14.980]  catastrophe, the one that is coming for 10 years and the last 50 years by the way, the
[1:42:14.980 --> 1:42:19.660]  central theme of the world economic forum's material is what they call the great reset
[1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:24.580]  which is Klaus Schwab's term for the opportunity the pandemic has presented to reimagine and
[1:42:24.580 --> 1:42:30.340]  reinvent the economic policies of the west, the term comes from Schwab directly himself
[1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:35.780]  with his 2020 book entitled the great reset, in a now deleted video titled eight predictions
[1:42:35.780 --> 1:42:42.980]  for the world in 2030, and it goes on from there, we need Senator Alex Antic to be the
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:48.820]  new prime minister of Australia, the current one is totally on the globalist payroll,
[1:42:48.820 --> 1:42:53.140]  this is a corporate system shutting down all their competition to consolidate power of
[1:42:53.140 --> 1:42:58.780]  the world economy to then carry out mass depopulation, you know, it's a fact and I'm
[1:42:58.780 --> 1:43:04.140]  not bragging when I say it, it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as
[1:43:04.140 --> 1:43:11.220]  the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their
[1:43:11.220 --> 1:43:18.380]  transhumanist anti human program and man our work is really right now hitting the most
[1:43:18.380 --> 1:43:24.220]  important aspects of what we've ever done so I'm asking listeners now to realise we've

[1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:04.700]  Get our great bag of it here I mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico
[1:45:04.700 --> 1:45:09.700]  the communist. Well that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested
[1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:14.420]  above organic in the volcanic soil better than Guatemalan coffee and yeah we buy it from
[1:45:14.420 --> 1:45:17.420]  the little farmers that you know the media calls communists but really they're just
[1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:21.260]  a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the
[1:45:21.260 --> 1:45:24.620]  farmers don't let the Mexican government take over so I actually buy this from the Mexican
[1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:27.820]  rebels and I've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up. The
[1:45:27.820 --> 1:45:32.500]  same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound and I just
[1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:35.500]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere. It's Wake Up America
[1:45:35.500 --> 1:45:41.500]  Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels literally. In fact I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[1:45:41.500 --> 1:45:49.180]  We had like that. Okay you wouldn't believe it. Anyway so it's infowarstore.com and that's
[1:45:49.180 --> 1:45:57.620]  how we fund this operation and if you don't fund us and don't want to share that's fine.
[1:45:57.620 --> 1:46:03.020]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:07.580]  a healthier life. Info Wars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your
[1:46:07.580 --> 1:46:13.060]  system with a supplement that contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus
[1:46:13.060 --> 1:46:18.180]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the info wars store. The rose hips contained
[1:46:18.180 --> 1:46:24.620]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[1:46:24.620 --> 1:46:29.460]  Info chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:46:29.460 --> 1:46:34.180]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:38.940]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[1:46:38.940 --> 1:46:44.020]  important role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:49.140]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:46:49.140 --> 1:46:54.180]  like here in America. So next time you visit be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[1:46:54.180 --> 1:47:01.180]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[1:47:24.180 --> 1:47:31.180]  The major corporations of the planet are run behind scientific guilds and they want to
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:48:00.380]  a monopoly over human life. They don't want to just have all the major crops be GMO and
[1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:04.780]  designed by these corporations. They want humans to be and they are bragging all of
[1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:09.940]  them. We played you the clips just last few days from the Debo script saying we are involved
[1:48:09.940 --> 1:48:16.940]  in a genetic engineering revolution taking over the human bodies. Just last year the
[1:48:18.020 --> 1:48:23.380]  federal government said we have no jurisdiction over nanotech and food and so now nanotech
[1:48:23.380 --> 1:48:27.340]  is in the food and major universities have done studies in Europe and the U.S. people
[1:48:27.340 --> 1:48:31.940]  are finding it in their blood and in their brain tissue and it's causing all sorts of
[1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:37.340]  problems and you've got these transhumanists bragging that oh yeah we're colonizing your
[1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:43.740]  bodies right now. So everything else was a beta test that's why the human animal hybrids
[1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:47.820]  are out in the open and the pedophilia is out in the open and the transgenderism pushing
[1:48:47.820 --> 1:48:52.580]  it on kids is out in the open because it's all meant to destabilize you, freak you out,
[1:48:52.580 --> 1:48:59.580]  get you scared and get you to submit to every form of tyranny you can imagine and then some.
[1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:06.980]  And then it's crazy to see people finally starting to figure this out like this senator
[1:49:06.980 --> 1:49:13.980]  we played the clip from earlier from Australia Alex Antic and to see the media attacking
[1:49:13.980 --> 1:49:23.580]  him when all he did was very intelligently quote actual quotes by the globalist and they're
[1:49:23.580 --> 1:49:29.180]  like he's crazy, he's nuts, he's saying the Australian government is full speech, our
[1:49:29.180 --> 1:49:34.060]  alumni of this group are carrying this out while they're saying they're alumni, while
[1:49:34.060 --> 1:49:41.060]  they're executing the orders of Klaus Schwab who is the head of the Bilderberg group. Remember
[1:49:41.060 --> 1:49:44.540]  Alex Jones would expose the Bilderberg group and the media would say it didn't exist and
[1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:51.180]  I made films showing it existed just 15 years ago and now you see why the Bilderberg group
[1:49:51.180 --> 1:49:56.260]  is so important because we got their documents, we had the sources, we worked with people
[1:49:56.260 --> 1:50:02.380]  that had been covering Bilderberg group for 40, 50 years, people that had received the
[1:50:02.380 --> 1:50:07.300]  brain trust of Westbrook Pegler was covering Bilderberg before he even knew the name in
[1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:12.820]  the late 50s and then Big Jim Tucker who died like eight, nine years ago, good friend of
[1:50:12.820 --> 1:50:17.980]  mine and of course myself and others, Daniel Esteland, got to get him back on, I mean this
[1:50:17.980 --> 1:50:28.940]  is the real global controlling force, absolutely incredible to be here and to know that they
[1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:36.460]  are carrying all this out against us as they're playing God and that if we just got the public
[1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:41.220]  to realize that they're being attacked by this other group and this other group doesn't
[1:50:41.220 --> 1:50:44.780]  have their best interests at heart and this other group is out to get them then it would
[1:50:44.780 --> 1:50:52.020]  be game over but because of the censorship and the corporate control it's very hard
[1:50:52.020 --> 1:50:58.700]  to reach people and when someone talks about these real topics they get attacked, they
[1:50:58.700 --> 1:51:03.420]  get demonized because they're over the target but you want to be demonized, you want to
[1:51:03.420 --> 1:51:08.100]  be attacked, if you really care about humanity, if you don't want this calamity and this whole
[1:51:08.100 --> 1:51:14.620]  takeover to actually take place then we all have a responsibility to get over the target
[1:51:14.620 --> 1:51:21.220]  and take the flag no matter how rough it is because as rough as this is letting them
[1:51:21.220 --> 1:51:26.820]  take over and letting them depopulate 90% of the world is going to be a lot tougher
[1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:31.620]  and a lot harder even if you want to join them and try to survive it, you then lose
[1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:36.700]  your humanity and is that something you really want to be part of?
[1:51:36.700 --> 1:51:41.540]  So by successive approximation they train people through social media, through the culture,
[1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:48.340]  through political correctness to submit to the godlessness, to submit to the mindlessness,
[1:51:48.340 --> 1:51:53.820]  to submit to the murder of logic, to submit to men can have babies and women can be men
[1:51:53.820 --> 1:52:05.020]  and robots are conscious and all these lies so that they know they've got someone that
[1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:11.100]  will go against their own interest, they know they've got somebody that will help them trigger
[1:52:11.100 --> 1:52:17.220]  the total collapse of civilization so they can build this transhumanist world on our
[1:52:17.220 --> 1:52:21.100]  ashes so you can pretend all day you're part of the power structure, you can try to play
[1:52:21.100 --> 1:52:29.740]  along with it, you can lie to yourself ladies and gentlemen but at the end of the day you've
[1:52:29.740 --> 1:52:34.220]  signed on to living death.
[1:52:34.220 --> 1:52:38.100]  You know I mentioned this Joe Biden clip where he is more confused, more out of his mind
[1:52:38.100 --> 1:52:44.500]  than ever and so since I mentioned it we've got a couple of these clips, let's just play
[1:52:44.500 --> 1:52:48.300]  the clip with Biden where he's saying he doesn't know why he's there getting the shot and we'll
[1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:54.300]  play the robot dog clip and get to all of that.
[1:52:54.300 --> 1:52:57.380]  How many times did I tell you you'll have robot dogs marching up and down the street
[1:52:57.380 --> 1:53:01.260]  telling you to stay in your houses during a bio weapon attack, I told you that ten years
[1:53:01.260 --> 1:53:07.900]  ago there's a video of it, specifically exactly this I told you, not hard to extrapolate this
[1:53:07.900 --> 1:53:16.860]  out and you know I said yesterday I would do it and I didn't because to actually make
[1:53:16.860 --> 1:53:31.540]  myself see the next phase of this is so horrible and so multifaceted that I almost, this isn't
[1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:35.340]  how it works but it's just crazy everything we talk about comes true, I almost don't want
[1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:38.060]  to speak this into existence though I know it's not us doing it, they're the ones doing
[1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:46.340]  it but I mean folks, I mean this is mass civilization collapse, robots taking everything over.
[1:53:46.340 --> 1:53:49.780]  Nothing like this planet's ever seen.
[1:53:49.780 --> 1:53:54.940]  Here is Biden again not knowing what planet he's on, taking his fourth shot and I'm going
[1:53:54.940 --> 1:54:06.620]  to get my second booster shot, which is the fourth shot, which isn't a vaccine, not sure
[1:54:06.620 --> 1:54:17.740]  why I'm doing this, he said not sure why I'm in the stage, it's fake White House.
[1:54:17.740 --> 1:54:22.260]  Can you comment on the declassified intelligence that he doesn't trust his military leadership
[1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:23.740]  since it is declassified?
[1:54:23.740 --> 1:54:24.740]  No.
[1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:42.140]  If anyone ever wanted to know what the dystopia looks like this is it, I mean all he's got
[1:54:42.140 --> 1:54:48.460]  is airing and it's left, he doesn't know who he is, what's going on just shut it off, please
[1:54:48.460 --> 1:54:50.900]  shut it off, thank you.
[1:54:50.900 --> 1:54:57.260]  Here's a robot dog, they've got these in New York everywhere now but this is in Shanghai,
[1:54:57.260 --> 1:55:01.740]  robot dogs with loudspeakers in forced Shanghai lockdown, no one's on the street, robots are
[1:55:01.740 --> 1:55:18.380]  running around saying stay in your houses, here it is.
[1:55:18.380 --> 1:55:24.900]  And of course we're all supposed to then go oh well they're doing it in Asia, we've got
[1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:30.620]  to submit to it and go along with it right now, I mean we're just literally inducting
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:34.020]  ourselves into hell on earth.
[1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:39.740]  All right, Roger Stone can tell you that orgies are real in DC because he used to run them,
[1:55:39.740 --> 1:55:44.340]  I mean he's repented of it and we're not judging him, it was consenting assaults but he's really
[1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:48.460]  written a couple big articles that are viral right now that Madison Cawthorne and the congressman
[1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:57.060]  talking about this is dead on and the congressman did not actually pull back on what he said.
[1:55:57.060 --> 1:56:00.980]  That's more fake news where he said oh he just said he was joking or it wasn't real,
[1:56:00.980 --> 1:56:05.100]  Roger Stone joined us coming up separately, I cannot continue to stay on air if you don't
[1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:08.780]  support us, I'm not bitching, I'm just saying it's true and we need to fundraise off this
[1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:14.300]  collectible coin that's part two in a three part limited series, this is the Tree of Liberty,
[1:56:14.300 --> 1:56:18.140]  it must be refreshed for the blood of patriots and tyrants, Thomas Jefferson quote with a
[1:56:18.140 --> 1:56:22.980]  skull on one side, Tree of Liberty on the other, we are extremely proud of it ladies
[1:56:22.980 --> 1:56:29.460]  and gentlemen and I again hope you get yours at infowarstore.com and we can show you that,

[1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:36.900]  I am so proud of the new coin and it is the second, the three part limited series and

[1:57:47.820 --> 1:57:55.500]  In December of 2021, Info Wars offered the first in a three part series, the 1776 anti
[1:57:55.500 --> 1:58:01.020]  tyrant coin and it's sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for listeners getting this

[1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:26.140]  blood of patriots and tyrants and more.

[1:59:49.540 --> 2:00:01.380]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:01.380 --> 2:00:07.420]  Roger Stone on OrgyGate joins us in T-minus 6 minutes and I wanted to go to report John
[2:00:07.420 --> 2:00:15.180]  Bowne put together about former InfoWars reporter Joe Biggs who's being held in a Soviet style
[2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:22.980]  gulag for crimes he didn't commit, here is that very important special report.
[2:00:22.980 --> 2:00:29.460]  Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs was born during the ominous year of 1984.
[2:00:29.460 --> 2:00:34.380]  What he and hundreds of other patriots now political prisoners have experienced over
[2:00:34.380 --> 2:00:39.940]  the course of a year due to the tyrannical Democratic Party for merely questioning a
[2:00:39.940 --> 2:00:45.780]  clearly re-presidential election, utilizing their First Amendment rights backed by the
[2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:52.420]  unyielding intent of the Declaration of Independence would make George Orwell's skin crawl.
[2:00:52.420 --> 2:00:59.900]  Joe Biggs is an American hero, he's a war hero, he fought in two wars, both Iraq and
[2:00:59.900 --> 2:01:07.540]  Afghanistan, two purple hearts, so he served bravely, honorably as a member of the US Army
[2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:15.780]  and now he's a political prisoner, he's rotting in a DC jail because I mean if anything this
[2:01:15.780 --> 2:01:21.420]  may be a misdemeanor, he didn't vandalize property on January 6th, he didn't hurt anybody,
[2:01:21.420 --> 2:01:25.300]  he didn't threaten anybody, he didn't have any fricking weapons and he certainly didn't
[2:01:25.300 --> 2:01:31.660]  try to overthrow the United States government and I think the most heartbreaking aspect
[2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:38.140]  of this whole situation is he hasn't seen his daughter in over a year and they're looking
[2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:47.100]  at putting Joe Biggs in prison for 20 plus years, okay, and I can tell you that his daughter
[2:01:47.100 --> 2:01:52.420]  means the world to him, alright, that's everything to him, now Joe Biggs is a tough guy, he's
[2:01:52.420 --> 2:01:59.620]  a combat veteran but this is absolutely crushing him, you cannot get that time back.
[2:01:59.620 --> 2:02:05.860]  We kind of saw the metamorphosis of a guy who was a big patriot, really believed in
[2:02:05.860 --> 2:02:11.380]  everything he was kind of told from the mainstream media perspective and then when this happened
[2:02:11.380 --> 2:02:16.340]  to a guy he knew, a guy he considered his friend and the way he was being talked about
[2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:21.340]  in the media, he started having a shift like oh wait, what we're seeing on the mainstream
[2:02:21.340 --> 2:02:22.740]  is not real life.
[2:02:22.740 --> 2:02:24.420]  He got really woken up quick.
[2:02:24.420 --> 2:02:30.060]  I think he kind of did a fast forward approach because then I think it went back to things
[2:02:30.060 --> 2:02:34.900]  he saw serving in two different theaters of war and he's like oh wait, maybe that's why
[2:02:34.900 --> 2:02:39.460]  we were doing these things and we're not really there to help these people, we're here to
[2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:42.420]  just spend money essentially.
[2:02:42.420 --> 2:02:48.700]  Joe has been exposing this for years, he sees the injustices going on with the election
[2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:53.380]  so people were pissed and they had a right to be pissed, now did he hit a cop, did he
[2:02:53.380 --> 2:02:58.300]  attack anybody, no, didn't do anything, didn't do any of that, yet he's still in jail to
[2:02:58.300 --> 2:02:59.300]  this day.
[2:02:59.300 --> 2:03:05.340]  Recently, Biden spoke of liberty and the regime change of a dictator while in Ukraine,
[2:03:05.340 --> 2:03:10.140]  but history and truth will ultimately separate fact from hypocrisy.
[2:03:10.140 --> 2:03:19.060]  A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty, brutality
[2:03:19.060 --> 2:03:22.620]  will never grind down their world to be free.
[2:03:22.620 --> 2:03:27.980]  Hey everybody, Pastor Kevin, the Patriot Pastor, I'm here at the Seminole County Jail.
[2:03:27.980 --> 2:03:34.980]  We are here with a few protesters, they decided to have a gathering to protest the release
[2:03:34.980 --> 2:03:39.980]  of Joe Biggs by sending him to the Washington DC jail.
[2:03:39.980 --> 2:03:44.540]  We're here to say you just can't do what you want to do, you just can't steal an election
[2:03:44.540 --> 2:03:45.540]  and get away with it.
[2:03:45.540 --> 2:03:52.900]  They're being held pre-trial for almost an entire year, waiting in solitary confinement
[2:03:52.900 --> 2:03:55.860]  with half rations of food, they're being starved.
[2:03:55.860 --> 2:04:01.140]  We're still here, we're still thinking about you, we're still praying for you, we're still
[2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:03.820]  fighting for you, we got this, Joe.
[2:04:03.820 --> 2:04:09.580]  Joe Biggs is in a 30-day administrative lockdown at the Alexandria Detention Center and he
[2:04:09.580 --> 2:04:15.220]  has filed an appeal opposing the government's motion to delay the start of his trial day,
[2:04:15.220 --> 2:04:16.580]  which is May the 18th.
[2:04:16.580 --> 2:04:23.740]  If you can, please visit GiveSendGo.com backslash Joe Biggs to add to his legal funds, which
[2:04:23.740 --> 2:04:29.880]  are desperately needed, and please support Infowars.com as we continue to be in the crosshairs
[2:04:29.880 --> 2:04:35.300]  of a January 6th committee held bent on silencing the voice of patriots.
[2:04:35.300 --> 2:04:40.620]  Biggs of course represents hundreds of patriots and ultimately millions of Americans who will
[2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:45.960]  all be thrown in a feces and blood drenched gulag and cut off from their God-given civil
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:51.940]  liberties due to a country half asleep and America's first bonafide dictator inhabiting
[2:04:51.940 --> 2:05:18.620]  the Oval Office, John Bowne reporting.
[2:05:18.620 --> 2:05:22.940]  Because these are historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom
[2:05:22.940 --> 2:05:26.320]  and keep Infowars at the front lines of the fight against these tyrants.

[2:06:05.860 --> 2:06:24.500]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen now into our number three Roger Stone joins us.
[2:06:24.500 --> 2:06:29.460]  We have seen Madison Cawthorn the Republican congressman come out and said that he was
[2:06:29.460 --> 2:06:31.380]  invited to orgies and cocaine parties.
[2:06:31.380 --> 2:06:35.580]  Well, I mean, I've got stacks of articles LA Times, New York Times about orgies and
[2:06:35.580 --> 2:06:40.980]  cocaine parties in D.C. Roger Stone was one of the top lobbyists ever.
[2:06:40.980 --> 2:06:43.460]  He was at obviously some of those parties.
[2:06:43.460 --> 2:06:46.780]  He's reformed and you know, obviously a Christian, but he's been honest about all that.
[2:06:46.780 --> 2:06:47.780]  He never really hit it.
[2:06:47.780 --> 2:06:52.860]  None of this was underage people or anything, but he hasn't retracted his statements.
[2:06:52.860 --> 2:06:54.500]  The media is spinning this.
[2:06:54.500 --> 2:06:59.020]  So or G gate is what Roger Stone is calling it Roger.
[2:06:59.020 --> 2:07:01.740]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[2:07:01.740 --> 2:07:07.020]  The reason I wanted to come on today is to is to bear witness for Madison Cawthorn who
[2:07:07.020 --> 2:07:09.140]  is being accused of telling the truth.
[2:07:09.140 --> 2:07:13.460]  Look, I was in Washington, D.C. I was part of the ruling elite.
[2:07:13.460 --> 2:07:15.740]  I lived there for 41 years.
[2:07:15.740 --> 2:07:20.820]  I had one of the most successful lobbying firms in American history and I had a front
[2:07:20.820 --> 2:07:21.820]  seat.
[2:07:21.820 --> 2:07:27.140]  I would say that I spent 41 years in the corroded rectum of the two party system and I saw this
[2:07:27.140 --> 2:07:28.780]  up close.
[2:07:28.780 --> 2:07:35.540]  Everybody out there who thinks that that the ruling elite in Washington, D.C. or Malibu
[2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:43.500]  or Manhattan or Hollywood do not engage in drug fueled orgies is out of their mind.
[2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:50.140]  And all of those in the media and in the Congress who are now attacking Madison Cawthorn stop
[2:07:50.140 --> 2:07:54.540]  and ask yourself, why are they doing that?
[2:07:54.540 --> 2:07:58.540]  Who are they covering for or is it themselves?
[2:07:58.540 --> 2:08:01.500]  I can tell you firsthand that these parties happen.
[2:08:01.500 --> 2:08:04.140]  I can tell you that they continue to happen.
[2:08:04.140 --> 2:08:09.500]  I can tell you that Madison Cawthorn told me yesterday that he had not retracted what
[2:08:09.500 --> 2:08:15.140]  he said, even though Kevin McCarthy seems to have popped up and speaking now for the
[2:08:15.140 --> 2:08:19.060]  member of Congress saying, oh, he admitted that he made no, I don't think he's admitted
[2:08:19.060 --> 2:08:20.540]  anything of the kind.
[2:08:20.540 --> 2:08:24.620]  I don't think he's admitted embellishing or retracted anything.
[2:08:24.620 --> 2:08:29.500]  He said, Alex, he spoke of the truth, which is why I want to come on with you today and
[2:08:29.500 --> 2:08:30.500]  say that.
[2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:37.100]  Well, you know, Roger, there's just so many examples of this and and Barney Frank with
[2:08:37.100 --> 2:08:43.980]  underage coal boys at his D.C. townhouse and just just all of it.
[2:08:43.980 --> 2:08:46.900]  I mean, the idea that this isn't going on is just preposterous.
[2:08:46.900 --> 2:08:51.420]  Well, look, I you said it at the beginning and I won't run away from it.
[2:08:51.420 --> 2:08:55.460]  I was a libertine in my days in Washington.
[2:08:55.460 --> 2:08:57.500]  So I attended some of these parties.
[2:08:57.500 --> 2:08:58.500]  Cocaine.
[2:08:58.500 --> 2:08:59.860]  No, it wasn't for me.
[2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:04.060]  But today I have reaffirmed my faith in Jesus Christ.
[2:09:04.060 --> 2:09:08.300]  That's why I feel that the the power and the strength to speak out and tell the truth.
[2:09:08.300 --> 2:09:11.220]  That's why I'm unafraid to tell you the truth.
[2:09:11.220 --> 2:09:14.460]  Now I know that I'll be mocked for coming on and saying this.
[2:09:14.460 --> 2:09:19.920]  I know I'll be attacked for, you know, for the life that I abandoned when I was a high
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:24.140]  roller in Washington, D.C. and anything I wanted was available to me.
[2:09:24.140 --> 2:09:26.060]  I'm a different person today.
[2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:27.060]  I was saved.
[2:09:27.060 --> 2:09:34.260]  I was saved from being in a in a blood and feces infested gulag called the federal penitentiary
[2:09:34.260 --> 2:09:35.260]  system.
[2:09:35.260 --> 2:09:40.980]  I didn't die in a fetid Georgia prison like Robert Mueller and his thugs wanted to only
[2:09:40.980 --> 2:09:44.220]  through the healing power and the strength of Jesus Christ.
[2:09:44.220 --> 2:09:49.860]  And that's why I'm able to say today without fear of being attacked because we'll be trending
[2:09:49.860 --> 2:09:55.860]  on Twitter as soon as we go off this broadcast, the instant that we you move on.
[2:09:55.860 --> 2:09:57.460]  It'll be all over the place.
[2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:02.260]  But I know firsthand that Madison Cawthorne is telling the truth and he needs to be given
[2:10:02.260 --> 2:10:03.700]  the benefit of the doubt.
[2:10:03.700 --> 2:10:09.660]  And I think you have to question why Kevin McCarthy is so anxious to cover this up.
[2:10:09.660 --> 2:10:13.460]  Why is he so anxious to silence this junior member of Congress?
[2:10:13.460 --> 2:10:17.900]  Why are all these rhinos jumping out of the woodwork attacking him?
[2:10:17.900 --> 2:10:19.340]  What are they hiding?
[2:10:19.340 --> 2:10:20.980]  What do they have to hide?
[2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:23.020]  Were they at some of these parties?
[2:10:23.020 --> 2:10:25.380]  Is that that's my question for them?
[2:10:25.380 --> 2:10:32.780]  Well, we also know doesn't McCarthy live with another man and they have like a model of
[2:10:32.780 --> 2:10:36.940]  the White House together and they like pose as the president in there.
[2:10:36.940 --> 2:10:44.340]  Well, he is it is alleged that he lives with a pollster, a Republican pollster.
[2:10:44.340 --> 2:10:50.460]  I don't think much of who's got the worst to pay I've ever seen in my entire life.
[2:10:50.460 --> 2:10:52.860]  So yeah, that's that's kind of weird.
[2:10:52.860 --> 2:10:57.140]  And then the question is, is this pollster on the payroll of the House Republican committees
[2:10:57.140 --> 2:10:58.140]  somewhere?
[2:10:58.140 --> 2:11:01.500]  The House Republican campaign committee.
[2:11:01.500 --> 2:11:06.620]  So look, I'm not here to attack other people and their lifestyle choices, but I am here
[2:11:06.620 --> 2:11:11.700]  to defend Madison Cawthorne because I think he is telling the truth.
[2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:16.760]  And now like a ton of bricks, the political establishment is seeking to discredit him.
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:24.180]  Why would we believe CNN when they say, Oh, McCarthy said that he admitted making the
[2:11:24.180 --> 2:11:25.180]  whole thing up?
[2:11:25.180 --> 2:11:27.660]  I want to hear from from the Congressman himself.
[2:11:27.660 --> 2:11:34.220]  I don't want to hear Kevin McCarthy's version of what he says Madison Cawthorne said or
[2:11:34.220 --> 2:11:37.180]  Steve Scalise for that matter.
[2:11:37.180 --> 2:11:42.740]  I want to hear what the Congressman said, he texted me yesterday, tell me he had not
[2:11:42.740 --> 2:11:45.740]  retracted or back down in any way.
[2:11:45.740 --> 2:11:47.060]  And I choose to believe him.
[2:11:47.060 --> 2:11:50.740]  I know firsthand that these parties happen.
[2:11:50.740 --> 2:11:53.100]  And I know who's attending them.
[2:11:53.100 --> 2:11:56.200]  It's bipartisan, trust me.
[2:11:56.200 --> 2:11:59.540]  And that's really how they control people, isn't it?
[2:11:59.540 --> 2:12:04.060]  Yeah, man, this is what the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was all about.
[2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:06.500]  It's about blackmail.
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:12.780]  And that's why there is such a rush to denounce and discredit Cawthorne because they're afraid
[2:12:12.780 --> 2:12:13.900]  of what he knows.
[2:12:13.900 --> 2:12:19.100]  What if he does start saying who it was he saw or who it was who invited him or who it
[2:12:19.100 --> 2:12:24.940]  was that he knows attended these drug-fueled parties that he alleges.
[2:12:24.940 --> 2:12:31.900]  So he has truth on his side and that makes him very, very dangerous to the political
[2:12:31.900 --> 2:12:32.900]  establishment.
[2:12:32.900 --> 2:12:33.900]  Well, that's right.
[2:12:33.900 --> 2:12:39.620]  And look, I mean, I can tell people, not that I'm Mr. Hollywood, but that's what goes on.
[2:12:39.620 --> 2:12:43.700]  People that have already had everything, done everything, they want to push the envelope.
[2:12:43.700 --> 2:12:49.740]  And I mean, that's pretty much par for the course, Swinger Clubs, orgies, drugs.
[2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:51.020]  That's going on all over.
[2:12:51.020 --> 2:12:55.220]  So the fact they're trying to deny this and all he said on a podcast is, hey, it's just
[2:12:55.220 --> 2:12:56.220]  like House of Cards.
[2:12:56.220 --> 2:12:57.300]  I've been invited to it.
[2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:58.300]  It's real.
[2:12:58.300 --> 2:12:59.300]  I mean, that's a fact.
[2:12:59.300 --> 2:13:00.620]  He had a super hot wife, too.
[2:13:00.620 --> 2:13:02.300]  I mean, what do you think people are going to do?
[2:13:02.300 --> 2:13:03.300]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[2:13:03.300 --> 2:13:04.860]  I've been invited to these things.
[2:13:04.860 --> 2:13:07.940]  I haven't gone to them because I don't want to be, you know, whatever blackmailer amount
[2:13:07.940 --> 2:13:08.940]  into that.
[2:13:08.940 --> 2:13:09.940]  I'm happy.
[2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:11.140]  But I mean, I've been invited not just to those.
[2:13:11.140 --> 2:13:14.940]  I've been invited to the really weird stuff, not with kids or anything, but with the whole
[2:13:14.940 --> 2:13:15.940]  occultic stuff.
[2:13:15.940 --> 2:13:21.140]  So I can tell you, folks, the eyes wide shut things go on as well.
[2:13:21.140 --> 2:13:22.140]  There's no question.
[2:13:22.140 --> 2:13:26.900]  Therefore, the people watching him for his employers need to realize that Madison Cawthorn
[2:13:26.900 --> 2:13:31.300]  is the guy telling the truth and all these rhinos who are moving to discredit him and
[2:13:31.300 --> 2:13:37.580]  smear him and belittle him and threatening to remove his committees.
[2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:40.380]  This is because they have something to hide.
[2:13:40.380 --> 2:13:42.060]  It is so obvious.
[2:13:42.060 --> 2:13:44.100]  It's so logical.
[2:13:44.100 --> 2:13:45.900]  Don't listen to anything CNN says.
[2:13:45.900 --> 2:13:48.420]  CNN wouldn't know the truth if they fell over.
[2:13:48.420 --> 2:13:53.260]  Well, I mean, I agree with you, but aren't they even dumber to attack him?
[2:13:53.260 --> 2:13:55.100]  They should have just ignored this.
[2:13:55.100 --> 2:13:56.620]  I totally agree with that.
[2:13:56.620 --> 2:14:00.860]  I spoke to a reporter from the New York Post a little while ago, and she made exactly
[2:14:00.860 --> 2:14:02.460]  that point.
[2:14:02.460 --> 2:14:04.580]  It's because they are so vulnerable.
[2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:10.300]  They're so hysterical because if he starts to name names, it would go all the way to
[2:14:10.300 --> 2:14:11.500]  the top.
[2:14:11.500 --> 2:14:13.860]  And that is exactly what they fear.
[2:14:13.860 --> 2:14:16.300]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[2:14:16.300 --> 2:14:17.780]  Find everything on his great website.
[2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:19.140]  He's got a lot of them.
[2:14:19.140 --> 2:14:20.580]  Which website you want to plug, Roger?
[2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:22.540]  And I got another question because I know you got to go.
[2:14:22.540 --> 2:14:24.660]  I want you to come back tomorrow about January 6th.
[2:14:24.660 --> 2:14:26.260]  That is really ripened now.
[2:14:26.260 --> 2:14:28.740]  They're announcing new indictments, garbage going after Trump.
[2:14:28.740 --> 2:14:33.140]  They're saying on May 20th, they're even putting dates on it.
[2:14:33.140 --> 2:14:35.740]  I want you to come back tomorrow and talk about that.
[2:14:35.740 --> 2:14:39.060]  But just where do people find all things Roger Stone?
[2:14:39.060 --> 2:14:41.500]  Best place to go is StoneColdTruth.com.
[2:14:41.500 --> 2:14:47.020]  I've got a new piece there because the report of the January 6th committee says that Peter
[2:14:47.020 --> 2:14:52.140]  Navarro, one of the president's White House aides told chief of staff, Mark Meadows,
[2:14:52.140 --> 2:14:55.500]  to call Roger Stone in the days prior to January 6th.
[2:14:55.500 --> 2:15:00.460]  All that, Alex, is I've never talked to Mark Meadows in my life, never communicated with
[2:15:00.460 --> 2:15:01.460]  him in any way.
[2:15:01.460 --> 2:15:04.500]  So they want to investigate something that never happened.
[2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:05.500]  It is outrageous.
[2:15:05.500 --> 2:15:08.940]  I'm still fighting for my life in six civil suits.
[2:15:08.940 --> 2:15:11.940]  People can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[2:15:11.940 --> 2:15:12.940]  God bless you if you do.
[2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:13.940]  We need the help.
[2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:18.580]  But Alex, I will come back tomorrow to talk about the abomination that is the January
[2:15:18.580 --> 2:15:19.580]  6th investigation.
[2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:23.740]  Well, I've told you privately what's going on, but now it's in the paper.
[2:15:23.740 --> 2:15:26.460]  I mean, you know, they called us a couple weeks ago, the Justice Department, not the
[2:15:26.460 --> 2:15:31.020]  committee and said, we want you to come talk to us or we might up charges on Owen.
[2:15:31.020 --> 2:15:32.580]  That is criminal in my view.
[2:15:32.580 --> 2:15:33.580]  We have nothing.
[2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:34.580]  We've done nothing.
[2:15:34.580 --> 2:15:35.580]  This is just a nightmare.
[2:15:35.580 --> 2:15:37.860]  Owen Schreuer did nothing wrong.
[2:15:37.860 --> 2:15:39.020]  I know that for a fact.
[2:15:39.020 --> 2:15:42.580]  We need to get those t-shirts out and up on the website.
[2:15:42.580 --> 2:15:47.540]  And now they're trying to use them as leverage to make people plead to crimes that they didn't
[2:15:47.540 --> 2:15:50.380]  commit or to admit something that they didn't do.
[2:15:50.380 --> 2:15:54.180]  Oh, now they're investigating the perfectly legal rally on the eclipse.
[2:15:54.180 --> 2:15:55.580]  Roger, we'll talk to you soon.
[2:15:55.580 --> 2:15:58.580]  Come back tomorrow.
[2:15:58.580 --> 2:16:07.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[2:16:07.420 --> 2:16:12.380]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[2:16:12.380 --> 2:16:18.140]  have broken down, and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying
[2:16:18.140 --> 2:16:23.180]  for operations and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making
[2:16:23.180 --> 2:16:25.100]  their main move in full wars.
[2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:26.100]  It's paradoxical.
[2:16:26.100 --> 2:16:30.500]  It's more popular than ever is reaching more people than ever despite the center ship.
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:34.020]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[2:16:34.020 --> 2:16:40.500]  our own bandwidth, everything else, we are running out of money to listen up to 75% off
[2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:46.180]  infowarstore.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread the word and fund
[2:16:46.180 --> 2:16:50.260]  the operation on supplements, on books, on films.
[2:16:50.260 --> 2:16:56.380]  Everything is 25 to 75% off right now, the biggest sell in our history at infowarstore.com.
[2:16:56.380 --> 2:17:02.460]  Thank you for your support.
[2:17:02.460 --> 2:17:04.260]  Granny do write, granny do write.
[2:17:04.260 --> 2:17:05.260]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:17:05.260 --> 2:17:06.260]  Go ahead.
[2:17:06.260 --> 2:17:08.860]  Challenge first of all, let me say I love your products.
[2:17:08.860 --> 2:17:14.420]  I am a granny and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[2:17:14.420 --> 2:17:15.420]  the sun like me.
[2:17:15.420 --> 2:17:19.860]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:24.900]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous
[2:17:24.900 --> 2:17:25.900]  actually.
[2:17:25.900 --> 2:17:29.180]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:17:29.180 --> 2:17:33.220]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:36.780]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:17:36.780 --> 2:17:41.340]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period
[2:17:41.340 --> 2:17:46.540]  of time, I started noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is
[2:17:46.540 --> 2:17:51.820]  wonderful, you know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:17:51.820 --> 2:18:00.060]  So anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:04.620]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients, vaso beets will
[2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:09.820]  be your new favorite infowars life formula.
[2:18:09.820 --> 2:18:14.700]  Taking only water and beetroot, vaso beets is the most concentrated liquid extract of
[2:18:14.700 --> 2:18:17.180]  feed on the market.
[2:18:17.180 --> 2:18:24.540]  With concentrated beet extract, you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates and antioxidants
[2:18:24.540 --> 2:18:31.300]  you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels and more.
[2:18:31.300 --> 2:18:35.220]  Don't overlook the power of beetroot.
[2:18:35.220 --> 2:18:42.100]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K
[2:18:42.100 --> 2:18:43.100]  and more.
[2:18:43.100 --> 2:18:58.060]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in vaso beets from infowars life today.
[2:18:58.060 --> 2:19:00.900]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming.
[2:19:00.900 --> 2:19:06.100]  They're here all over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[2:19:06.100 --> 2:19:09.580]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[2:19:09.580 --> 2:19:15.300]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[2:19:15.300 --> 2:19:20.460]  facilities and they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where
[2:19:20.460 --> 2:19:25.060]  they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[2:19:25.060 --> 2:19:28.700]  This is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is
[2:19:28.700 --> 2:19:33.060]  to get high quality Faraday cages many of which are made here in America and are very
[2:19:33.060 --> 2:19:37.980]  compliant meaning U.S. government military grade at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:37.980 --> 2:19:42.980]  We have the entire line of silent pocket ready to ship to you when you visit InfowarsStore.com.

[2:19:53.500 --> 2:19:59.740]  To protect your privacy today and support the Infowars at InfowarsStore.com.
[2:19:59.740 --> 2:20:27.340]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:29.740 --> 2:20:44.700]  Alright, I love 360 wins and I can't think of a better 360 win out there, the one we're
[2:20:44.700 --> 2:20:48.860]  about to talk about right now and I hope every list term marks this down, I hope you listen
[2:20:48.860 --> 2:20:52.180]  because we've got this guest back on and I pushed him back a little bit late because
[2:20:52.180 --> 2:20:57.260]  Roger Stone came on because I could spend hours with this guy, he had technical difficulties
[2:20:57.260 --> 2:21:01.500]  Saturday so we had to go to a tape show we'd already done a week before but we're going
[2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:07.660]  to do a commercial free podcast soon and really talk about some things that are common knowledge
[2:21:07.660 --> 2:21:13.380]  to good tax attorneys but is like unknown magic to the general public.
[2:21:13.380 --> 2:21:19.180]  And so, Tyler Bennett, good friend of mine is here with us, you can go to jonestaxrelief.com
[2:21:19.180 --> 2:21:24.060]  and you can see all the different services they have from bookkeeping, business consulting,
[2:21:24.060 --> 2:21:29.020]  business entity selection, estate and trust, and tax preparation, financial statements,
[2:21:29.020 --> 2:21:35.300]  IRS representation, payroll services, retirement planning, sales and tax services, tax preparation
[2:21:35.300 --> 2:21:38.860]  and planning, tax levies, liens and release, that's what they're really good at saving
[2:21:38.860 --> 2:21:45.140]  up to 90% on wage, garnishment release, getting your passport when the IRS is blocking you,
[2:21:45.140 --> 2:21:50.540]  in penalties and interest, you hear that, tax negotiation and settlement, reduce IRS tax
[2:21:50.540 --> 2:21:59.820]  fee, resolve back taxes, IRS, audit defense, payroll, tax negotiation and more, jonestaxrelief.com
[2:21:59.820 --> 2:22:08.700]  and again, they are a very respected company that's been doing a great job for a long time.
[2:22:08.700 --> 2:22:14.060]  That's American Tax Solutions, you just go to jonestaxrelief.com so you can also then
[2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:18.620]  support the sponsorship of the show so they know, support the broadcast, the sponsorship
[2:22:18.620 --> 2:22:24.500]  but this for me is just such a 360 win because it depends on the tax lawyers you get, the
[2:22:24.500 --> 2:22:28.620]  CPAs most of them will sell you out for no reason, it's just how it works and then a
[2:22:28.620 --> 2:22:31.420]  lot of the lawyers just want to get you and milk a bunch of stuff out of you, these guys
[2:22:31.420 --> 2:22:36.060]  cut right to the chase and how to save you money because they get part of that.
[2:22:36.060 --> 2:22:45.340]  So jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285, write that number down, 833-900-4285, I wanted
[2:22:45.340 --> 2:22:49.980]  to get him on because we had a lot of questions from listeners and so I've got some of these
[2:22:49.980 --> 2:22:55.220]  questions I want to go over with him, I just got flooded by questions and I sent them over
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:23:00.260]  to him and he kind of put them into a bullet point but man, I'm getting nothing but good
[2:23:00.260 --> 2:23:05.060]  feedback from the listeners, I think you've already saved them tens of millions of dollars,
[2:23:05.060 --> 2:23:09.380]  I think it was $20 million last week or something so thank you for being here, thank you for
[2:23:09.380 --> 2:23:14.460]  coming on Tyler Bennett, I mean where do we start though, there's so much to cover.
[2:23:14.460 --> 2:23:21.420]  Well, thanks for having me on again Alex, great to be here and help the InfoWars both
[2:23:21.420 --> 2:23:28.740]  with the audience and the cause here and so when I had these questions asked to me it
[2:23:28.740 --> 2:23:33.580]  seemed to me that basically just like you were saying because we know that the IRS is run
[2:23:33.580 --> 2:23:39.020]  by the globalists and the elite and so their set of rules, their set of laws, they don't
[2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:42.500]  want the average person to know so I thought I'd go through a few of this stuff that you
[2:23:42.500 --> 2:23:47.740]  probably haven't heard of and it can open your eyes a little bit more to how the government
[2:23:47.740 --> 2:23:49.460]  is actually treating you here.
[2:23:49.460 --> 2:23:56.020]  So for example, the first thing is Biden has been trying attempting to raise taxes since
[2:23:56.020 --> 2:24:02.260]  he got into office, we all know about that but what you may not know is taxes have been
[2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:09.580]  effectively already raised this year because of inflation, what I mean is every year there's
[2:24:09.580 --> 2:24:15.780]  an index for inflation that affects the standard deduction and affects the tax, marginal tax
[2:24:15.780 --> 2:24:23.060]  brackets because it goes up 3% a year per inflation, however, this last year we've experienced
[2:24:23.060 --> 2:24:30.740]  8% in inflation and that means the American taxpayer is paying 5% more in taxes just due
[2:24:30.740 --> 2:24:37.940]  to the inflation not in the actuarial numbers that the IRS uses not keeping up to the actual
[2:24:37.940 --> 2:24:41.820]  inflation that Biden has injected into the economy.
[2:24:41.820 --> 2:24:48.380]  And so what that comes out to is a married couple last year that made $80,000 was tax
[2:24:48.380 --> 2:24:55.140]  at 22% marginal, now they would be in the 24 marginal tax rate because not that taxes
[2:24:55.140 --> 2:25:02.980]  were raised but because inflation outpaced the actuarial table at the IRS that says inflation
[2:25:02.980 --> 2:25:08.420]  is only supposed to be 3% a year and it's 8% right now.
[2:25:08.420 --> 2:25:11.420]  And that's just question number one, sorry, continue.
[2:25:11.420 --> 2:25:15.340]  That's just question number one, you're right, I just wanted to finish up on that.
[2:25:15.340 --> 2:25:21.140]  This is a sneaky way that the administration and the globalists can say, hey, we haven't
[2:25:21.140 --> 2:25:26.180]  actually raised taxes on you but get more of your hard earned money to fight the things
[2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:36.740]  that they want to fight for, the pocket, not fighting the globalist wars, etc., etc.
[2:25:36.740 --> 2:25:40.340]  And also want to expand on this because people don't realize that they're not going to be
[2:25:40.340 --> 2:25:43.900]  told this by H&R blocks, they're not going to be told this by the regular CPAs.
[2:25:43.900 --> 2:25:44.900]  Why is that?
[2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:49.420]  Why don't they tell people all the loopholes that are totally legal and lawful put in there
[2:25:49.420 --> 2:25:50.420]  by the establishment?
[2:25:50.420 --> 2:25:53.300]  Because I guess they're not supposed to let you know about that.
[2:25:53.300 --> 2:25:58.540]  What is the leverage that the corrupt government has over the average CPA firm to keep them
[2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:01.460]  from telling people how the law is really written?
[2:26:01.460 --> 2:26:03.460]  Absolutely, Alex.
[2:26:03.460 --> 2:26:05.980]  So we have two things going on here.
[2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:11.660]  If we're talking about an average CPA firm, the average CPA is very risk adverse.
[2:26:11.660 --> 2:26:17.100]  That's the type of people who become certified public accountants, which means if the IRS
[2:26:17.100 --> 2:26:21.500]  says something, they're going to follow it to the T. That's their job.
[2:26:21.500 --> 2:26:22.900]  And there is use for these people.
[2:26:22.900 --> 2:26:24.540]  I have CPAs that work for me.
[2:26:24.540 --> 2:26:30.260]  But not to decide how much exactly who is qualified for what, deduction.
[2:26:30.260 --> 2:26:32.580]  To do the math, sure.
[2:26:32.580 --> 2:26:37.500]  But we have to remember as a CPA is not an advocate.
[2:26:37.500 --> 2:26:40.980]  Their job isn't to find the loopholes and fight for you.
[2:26:40.980 --> 2:26:47.420]  Their job is to fill out the tax return in a way that's going to be the safest and least
[2:26:47.420 --> 2:26:49.620]  risky according to them.
[2:26:49.620 --> 2:26:53.900]  Which for most people means they're going to miss out on obvious deductions that they
[2:26:53.900 --> 2:26:55.780]  could have taken.
[2:26:55.780 --> 2:27:03.020]  And now the second part is when we talk about these big box tax doors, you know, H&R block,
[2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:07.420]  the like, TurboTax, as I've said on your show before, this is absolutely true.
[2:27:07.420 --> 2:27:08.420]  Look them up.
[2:27:08.420 --> 2:27:10.780]  These are technology companies, okay?
[2:27:10.780 --> 2:27:17.540]  They're much more closer to Microsoft than, let's say, a tax office because the people
[2:27:17.540 --> 2:27:20.500]  who work there know one thing and one thing only.
[2:27:20.500 --> 2:27:21.900]  And it's not taxes.
[2:27:21.900 --> 2:27:25.140]  They know how to operate that software.
[2:27:25.140 --> 2:27:27.900]  And so they have no idea what the law is at all.
[2:27:27.900 --> 2:27:29.900]  They just know what the computer prints out.
[2:27:29.900 --> 2:27:33.500]  And believe me, that computer does not have your best interest at heart.
[2:27:33.500 --> 2:27:38.980]  It wants to make sure they can charge you 450 and pad their coffers instead of yours.
[2:27:38.980 --> 2:27:39.980]  Absolutely.
[2:27:39.980 --> 2:27:44.140]  That's something I learned talking to friends and family about when you go and get the average
[2:27:44.140 --> 2:27:45.140]  stop broker.
[2:27:45.140 --> 2:27:48.020]  You notice you only make two, three percent a year because they're getting it all in fees.
[2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:50.820]  But you go out and research it yourself, you're going to make 15, 20 percent.
[2:27:50.820 --> 2:27:52.820]  So how's the stock market up 20 percent?
[2:27:52.820 --> 2:27:55.500]  But you didn't make anything because they literally take all your fees.
[2:27:55.500 --> 2:27:59.420]  I'm not going to get into details that I have a family member that came into some money.
[2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:00.420]  They didn't listen to me.
[2:28:00.420 --> 2:28:01.420]  And I said, watch.
[2:28:01.420 --> 2:28:03.340]  You go ahead and put your money with that stock broker at a well-known company.
[2:28:03.340 --> 2:28:05.340]  I bet you make two percent.
[2:28:05.340 --> 2:28:07.820]  And they came to me a year later and they go, how did you guess that the stock market's
[2:28:07.820 --> 2:28:08.820]  up 20 percent?
[2:28:08.820 --> 2:28:09.820]  This was a few years ago.
[2:28:09.820 --> 2:28:10.820]  How'd you guess two percent?
[2:28:10.820 --> 2:28:13.100]  And I said, it's well known.
[2:28:13.100 --> 2:28:15.500]  It's well known that that's what they do to you.
[2:28:15.500 --> 2:28:16.900]  It's the same thing.
[2:28:16.900 --> 2:28:18.400]  Absolutely.
[2:28:18.400 --> 2:28:23.980]  Just on that point, since we're talking about finance here, the index does 10 percent every
[2:28:23.980 --> 2:28:24.980]  year.
[2:28:24.980 --> 2:28:25.980]  If you invest in that, you'll make money.
[2:28:25.980 --> 2:28:29.900]  I have invested in managed brokerage accounts and they don't do as well as the index.
[2:28:29.900 --> 2:28:34.540]  So just putting that out there, listen, when you let somebody else control your money and
[2:28:34.540 --> 2:28:40.220]  you put all of your faith into them, well, now you're putting yourself to be taken advantage
[2:28:40.220 --> 2:28:41.220]  of.
[2:28:41.220 --> 2:28:42.220]  And that's just what happens in this.
[2:28:42.220 --> 2:28:43.220]  That's right.
[2:28:43.220 --> 2:28:47.300]  We only got through question one and we got like 15 of, we'll be right back on the other
[2:28:47.300 --> 2:28:48.300]  side.
[2:28:48.300 --> 2:28:49.300]  These are really good questions.
[2:28:49.300 --> 2:28:52.580]  Let's just sit in and you kind of codified them and put them into perspective.
[2:28:52.580 --> 2:28:53.580]  We'll be right back.
[2:28:53.580 --> 2:28:57.580]  Stay with us.
[2:28:57.580 --> 2:29:01.340]  We are only offering three coins in the series.
[2:29:01.340 --> 2:29:05.940]  The first coin was released in December of 2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:13.700]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April, 2022 is now being offered
[2:29:13.700 --> 2:29:18.260]  and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins

[2:32:15.380 --> 2:32:16.380]  effects.
[2:32:16.380 --> 2:32:22.020]  According to ancient Samoan legend Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa who
[2:32:22.020 --> 2:32:26.300]  they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:32:26.300 --> 2:32:30.980]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[2:32:30.980 --> 2:32:32.220]  loosen up a little.

[2:33:06.220 --> 2:33:27.340]  Hey listen folks I could finance the whole show right now with sports gambling and pay
[2:33:27.340 --> 2:33:31.340]  all our bills and everything else and I'm into free will that people want to gamble
[2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:35.140]  most folks don't have a problem with it it's has some fun I'm not judging people to take
[2:33:35.140 --> 2:33:43.100]  gambling money but we right now have had top former sports people UFC champions, heavyweight
[2:33:43.100 --> 2:33:48.420]  boxing champions, NFL quarterbacks that represent these groups they're ready to spend a million
[2:33:48.420 --> 2:33:53.180]  dollars a month right now that's not where I sell a million dollars worth of supplements
[2:33:53.180 --> 2:33:59.060]  than at five hundred thousand to pay the bills that's a million dollars I could snap my fingers
[2:33:59.060 --> 2:34:03.180]  they're ready right now I'm actually thinking about it like you know find the operation
[2:34:03.180 --> 2:34:07.980]  people want to go gamble but I'm like no it's not a win-win some people have heard some
[2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:13.420]  it can get out of control so I'm not taking the gambling money but I'm kind of balancing
[2:34:13.420 --> 2:34:18.500]  like go off the air or take the gambling money but with something like American Tax Solutions
[2:34:18.500 --> 2:34:22.300]  that I've known and my family and friends have used and I know they really help people
[2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:28.100]  I just feel good about it so you know if if if weapon sales you know to bomb third world
[2:34:28.100 --> 2:34:32.180]  countries on one end and then you got gambling over here and you got liquor over here and
[2:34:32.180 --> 2:34:37.180]  cigarettes over here and I'm not selling any of that what that's on the bad side way over
[2:34:37.180 --> 2:34:42.740]  here you know landmines are on one end and then way over here is tax solutions teaching
[2:34:42.740 --> 2:34:46.820]  people how the globalist exempt themselves from almost all the taxes giving the people
[2:34:46.820 --> 2:34:51.340]  that power that makes me feel good at night that gets me excited that's why I say it's
[2:34:51.340 --> 2:34:56.140]  a 360 win and I didn't mean to go to the gambling story it's just solve all our problems snap
[2:34:56.140 --> 2:35:02.380]  my fingers and sports betting it's ready it's there your long contract 12 million dollars
[2:35:02.380 --> 2:35:08.420]  but I'm not doing it just because again I'm not against gambling I'm not saying you shouldn't
[2:35:08.420 --> 2:35:12.540]  be able to gamble I don't really like gambling I gamble on freedom I gamble on standing up
[2:35:12.540 --> 2:35:16.340]  what's right I don't go slot machines and you know poker and all that stuff which is
[2:35:16.340 --> 2:35:21.620]  fine people have fun with it some people it really hurts them I'm just saying again this
[2:35:21.620 --> 2:35:29.060]  is a sponsor I know it's great and I know is a win-win I mean on average 90% tax cuts
[2:35:29.060 --> 2:35:34.700]  in these disputes and all the other services they've got so you need to go there today
[2:35:34.700 --> 2:35:40.140]  Jones tax relief dot com Jones tax relief dot com Tyler Bennett let's get into more
[2:35:40.140 --> 2:35:45.460]  of these questions that people sent you absolutely Alex and just on the gambling thing I want
[2:35:45.460 --> 2:35:50.860]  to say to the audience here if you do enjoy to gamble one thing that's very important
[2:35:50.860 --> 2:35:55.660]  is that you know the casino at the end of the year is going to 1099 you so you have
[2:35:55.660 --> 2:36:01.480]  to make sure you get your players card from the casino so that you can write off your
[2:36:01.480 --> 2:36:05.260]  losses against your winnings because otherwise the government's just going to say that you
[2:36:05.260 --> 2:36:09.620]  made that money but really we know if you're gambling maybe you made 10 grand one time
[2:36:09.620 --> 2:36:12.780]  but you probably spent more than that over the course of the year and so that's right
[2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:16.060]  so you get people to think about I love how you take anything I say and turn it back to
[2:36:16.060 --> 2:36:21.620]  the good you can teach people at every angle they never thought about absolutely and here's
[2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:26.900]  the thing gambling is one of those things actually were you know what some people can
[2:36:26.900 --> 2:36:31.340]  can make a business out of it such as you know den blitz area and people like that who
[2:36:31.340 --> 2:36:36.460]  are professional poker players right and so gambling typically follows under the hobby
[2:36:36.460 --> 2:36:42.020]  rules meaning that it most people do it for a hobby so unless you can prove to the IRS
[2:36:42.020 --> 2:36:47.100]  that you can make a profit three out of five years or every other year then you can actually
[2:36:47.100 --> 2:36:51.900]  write off all your expenses on schedule see against that income because it's a legitimate
[2:36:51.900 --> 2:36:56.500]  business to you but most people who go play 21 or house games that's not going to call
[2:36:56.500 --> 2:36:59.500]  they're not going to qualify for that but they need to know that just because they hit
[2:36:59.500 --> 2:37:03.500]  a jackpot does not necessarily mean they're going to face attack fat tax bill at the end
[2:37:03.500 --> 2:37:07.660]  of the year because that more likely than not was not the only time they gambled that year
[2:37:07.660 --> 2:37:12.460]  and we can write off all their losses again every angle you've got every angle let's get
[2:37:12.460 --> 2:37:21.100]  into the next question we do IRS side hustle $600 gets you to 1099 explain that this is
[2:37:21.100 --> 2:37:26.740]  this is a very important one I've gotten thousands of questions about this because this is actually
[2:37:26.740 --> 2:37:32.780]  a bill that Biden was able to pass back in the build back better act and what this says
[2:37:32.780 --> 2:37:41.940]  is all escrow services intermediary banking services such as Zell Venmo PayPal even eBay
[2:37:41.940 --> 2:37:51.420]  and reseller such as that Etsy stock X are now going to 1099 any sale that is over $600
[2:37:51.420 --> 2:37:58.580]  now the old rules where you would have to sell at least 20 transactions or over $20,000 before
[2:37:58.580 --> 2:38:03.660]  the service would say you prove to us that you're not a business but now what this means
[2:38:03.660 --> 2:38:09.260]  is let's say you decide to have a garage sale and someone comes up to buy your old microwave
[2:38:09.260 --> 2:38:12.420]  that's worth less than what you bought it for and they don't have cash because it's
[2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:19.460]  2022 and they say can I sell you the $50 for the thing okay fine so you take enough Zells
[2:38:19.460 --> 2:38:24.340]  now it's up to $600 and you didn't make any money because it's a garage sale from stuff
[2:38:24.340 --> 2:38:29.300]  that has just gone down in value well you have to prove that now and so you don't want
[2:38:29.300 --> 2:38:34.580]  to do that on your own help let me do that for you because I know how to separate out
[2:38:34.580 --> 2:38:43.220]  what is gifts what is income and what is not because it was simply a resale for a non profitable
[2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:44.220]  transaction.
[2:38:44.220 --> 2:38:47.300]  Alright let's move to the next one we've got 15 to go through just because number three
[2:38:47.300 --> 2:38:52.580]  your return says you are getting a refund does not mean you will really get it explain
[2:38:52.580 --> 2:38:54.860]  that to us.
[2:38:54.860 --> 2:38:58.940]  Absolutely Alex and this one is very important and happens to a lot of people I get a lot
[2:38:58.940 --> 2:39:04.140]  of clients potential clients they call me and they say hey you know I did my taxes and
[2:39:04.140 --> 2:39:10.160]  it says that I should have gotten you know a thousand dollar refund or more but instead
[2:39:10.160 --> 2:39:18.220]  I got a letter that says tax code 151 on it and what that means is there is what's called
[2:39:18.220 --> 2:39:23.700]  a federal offset unit within the treasury department they are technically not the IRS
[2:39:23.700 --> 2:39:29.940]  because what they do is they collect debts for the states and the IRS from your refund
[2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:35.300]  so before your refund comes back to you if you owe any debt to any other government
[2:39:35.300 --> 2:39:43.180]  agency for any reason this includes stuff like child support arrears or let's say unemployment
[2:39:43.180 --> 2:39:47.980]  they actually will take that money straight out of your refund and so if that's happening
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:51.940]  to you too we can negotiate that on your behalf.
[2:39:51.940 --> 2:39:58.020]  But this is the federal Bureau of Fiscal Service they are a federal agency that literally exists
[2:39:58.020 --> 2:40:05.220]  only to subtract and deduct out of your refund check to pay back a legend money that you
[2:40:05.220 --> 2:40:06.220]  owe.
[2:40:06.220 --> 2:40:09.380]  And you got simple tricks to deal with all that let's go to number four new numbers for
[2:40:09.380 --> 2:40:14.260]  gift taxing what's happening there people are asking me about that.
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:23.300]  So gift tax is one of the most misunderstood concepts in the code okay with inflation
[2:40:23.300 --> 2:40:30.300]  now it's sixteen thousand dollars that you can gift to anybody without facing the gift
[2:40:30.300 --> 2:40:35.100]  tax right and the gift tax is paid by the gift tour not the gifty and the reason is
[2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:43.900]  because the gift tax is put in place to try to prevent escaping the estate tax by giving
[2:40:43.900 --> 2:40:45.420]  gifts during your lifetime.
[2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:50.820]  Now the thing is that the middle class needs to understand is we can use these rules that
[2:40:50.820 --> 2:40:56.580]  were put in place to try to prevent the uber wealthy from not paying their fair and check
[2:40:56.580 --> 2:41:01.700]  in taxes by not you know using these rules to pay the least amount as possible.
[2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:07.260]  So what sixteen thousand dollars means is that's not your total amount that you can gift that's
[2:41:07.260 --> 2:41:12.180]  your total amount that you can gift to each individual person you send gifts to.
[2:41:12.180 --> 2:41:16.380]  So let's say you send gifts to ten different people for sixteen thousand well that's a
[2:41:16.380 --> 2:41:20.500]  hundred and sixty thousand dollars of gifts that you were able to give and I just want
[2:41:20.500 --> 2:41:26.940]  to mention that gift tax ties into your unified lifetime credit so unless you're worth more
[2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:34.940]  than twelve million dollars you should be using gifts and gift tax system to minimize
[2:41:34.940 --> 2:41:35.940]  your tax.
[2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:38.700]  That's why all the rich people have a bunch of trust funds for their kids and everybody
[2:41:38.700 --> 2:41:43.340]  so you're just teaching people the basic stuff but easy how to do it you don't rip
[2:41:43.340 --> 2:41:47.060]  them off to do it you just boom get it done.
[2:41:47.060 --> 2:41:51.820]  Right a hundred percent because on my tiktok page and other places I answer questions and
[2:41:51.820 --> 2:41:56.740]  hear from from the the info wars people people always say hey I give a gift I received a
[2:41:56.740 --> 2:42:01.620]  gift how much taxes do I owe on it that's not how it works the gift or pays tax is a
[2:42:01.620 --> 2:42:05.700]  completely different system than the income tax system and just like the payroll tax
[2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:09.380]  system we can use those tax systems against your income tax.
[2:42:09.380 --> 2:42:11.660]  I'm going to explain it again I know the listeners know this but you have to listen to me folks
[2:42:11.660 --> 2:42:15.980]  this is the total win-win I feel so good promoting this I feel one hundred percent good promoting
[2:42:15.980 --> 2:42:19.380]  this I feel bad thinking about saving the operation promoting gambling not going to
[2:42:19.380 --> 2:42:20.380]  do it.
[2:42:20.380 --> 2:42:22.780]  Okay I'm not going to sell Jack Gale even though I occasionally drink it.
[2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:26.740]  Hey don't gamble with your taxes okay that's what it's about.
[2:42:26.740 --> 2:42:32.700]  Absolutely what I'm saying is this is something that is an absolute win-win for the show
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:37.260]  or you know our sponsor for you for everybody and there's so many functions and so many
[2:42:37.260 --> 2:42:42.860]  angles I could talk to him forever Mr. Bennett because there's so many things you wouldn't
[2:42:42.860 --> 2:42:47.380]  think of no matter what topic I raise he can bring up a tax issue that I knew was true
[2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:51.860]  but I've forgotten about because he's the tax expert and he's ready to help you boom

[2:47:50.340 --> 2:47:55.900]  I brought up gambling on a totally different subject and he brought up incredible information
[2:47:55.900 --> 2:48:00.420]  about tax savings there talking to the sky I could talk to him like hours and hours and
[2:48:00.420 --> 2:48:06.660]  we have him on the phone in person because every angle of life he knows the secrets of
[2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:12.580]  how the system protects itself and nothing makes me happier than getting you involved
[2:48:12.580 --> 2:48:18.820]  in knowing that I want to be very clear I obviously you know I'm a Christian and I love
[2:48:18.820 --> 2:48:23.540]  God and if taxes actually went to poor people and to build stuff I would do it everything
[2:48:23.540 --> 2:48:29.420]  through the Federal Reserve is through monetizing debt since 1913 what 109 years ago so before
[2:48:29.420 --> 2:48:34.820]  that taxes went around the country since then any economist will tell you it's not my opinion
[2:48:34.820 --> 2:48:40.860]  that it's all debt that's operating so all of the income taxes 1913 with the Federal
[2:48:40.860 --> 2:48:46.540]  Reserve Act is about social engineering and controlling small businesses just like during
[2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:53.620]  COVID lockdown small businesses were not essential but all of the big businesses were staying
[2:48:53.620 --> 2:49:01.420]  open so you're not cheating on your taxes you're not taking care of the poor by paying
[2:49:01.420 --> 2:49:08.500]  almost no taxes you're literally being given the same escape patches that the globalists
[2:49:08.500 --> 2:49:13.540]  have created and getting by their social engineering so you can hire more people so you can hire
[2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:18.100]  more contractors so you can build an icer house have an icer car pay for more medicine
[2:49:18.100 --> 2:49:25.460]  give more to charity so I'm telling you there's nothing more of a win and from a moral perspective
[2:49:25.460 --> 2:49:30.580]  as well than not paying as much of this evil income taxes you can because it's a damn
[2:49:30.580 --> 2:49:34.900]  fraud so spend a few minutes Tyler Bennett on that and I know you want to get into all
[2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:39.220]  these other topics you've got small business owners and what's happening with expenses
[2:49:39.220 --> 2:49:43.420]  and so much more but but how important is that because there's people don't get like
[2:49:43.420 --> 2:49:51.220]  the income taxes social engineering 100% true Alex and and as I've said before since
[2:49:51.220 --> 2:49:58.500]  the income tax was created it has been the vehicle that the government put forth their
[2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:04.340]  policies that they want to happen in America because we're supposed to be a free country
[2:50:04.340 --> 2:50:09.340]  the government is they don't do this anyway but instead of just directly telling you to
[2:50:09.340 --> 2:50:14.540]  do something they put incentives and they put and they put decentives in the tax code
[2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:20.820]  so that you act a certain way so I just want to say this because we're talking about money
[2:50:20.820 --> 2:50:25.500]  look on any bill you pull up right this is a five dollar bill it says two things on it
[2:50:25.500 --> 2:50:31.020]  says in God we trust yeah I trust God okay it also says Federal Reserve note that means
[2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:35.740]  I trust the government in this fiat currency well I don't know about you but I really don't
[2:50:35.740 --> 2:50:41.580]  trust the government so let's talk about some things that they are doing to make sure you
[2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:49.420]  miss out on your deductions okay so small businesses small business owners mom and pops these people
[2:50:49.420 --> 2:50:56.300]  in the middle class are receiving the shaft the hardest because sex subsection C subsection
[2:50:56.300 --> 2:51:02.220]  S in the business sections of the internal revenue code are the most complex and actually
[2:51:02.220 --> 2:51:05.620]  carry the most deductions but they're the hardest to find if you don't know what you're looking
[2:51:05.620 --> 2:51:13.660]  for let me break down a few for you in 2017 President Trump passed a 20% pass through
[2:51:13.660 --> 2:51:18.020]  deduction if you have a sole prop if you have an escort if you have an LLC all you really
[2:51:18.020 --> 2:51:27.300]  have to do if you fit the income you know guidelines which is most people is check a box on your
[2:51:27.300 --> 2:51:31.180]  tax return and so most people don't even know that and that's something that is very easy
[2:51:31.180 --> 2:51:37.820]  to do and you'd have to know about it another one is you know business vehicles right writing
[2:51:37.820 --> 2:51:43.820]  off a vehicle is a commonly talked about deduction but you may not know the extent of which you
[2:51:43.820 --> 2:51:47.700]  could do it let's say you know you only have a sole prop you've got a C Corp you've got
[2:51:47.700 --> 2:51:53.740]  a S S but you have a vehicle that also you're using for personal use does that mean that
[2:51:53.740 --> 2:51:59.740]  you no longer can take any deduction for the business use of that vehicle absolutely not
[2:51:59.740 --> 2:52:04.380]  we can bifurcate everything you know and you might be surprised to learn that when we look
[2:52:04.380 --> 2:52:09.660]  at what's actually happening more of that vehicles use is in fact a business use then
[2:52:09.660 --> 2:52:16.820]  not another one this is big back in the 80s and 90s they had this tax deduction called
[2:52:16.820 --> 2:52:22.300]  the three martini lunch basically what it meant is there's 100% deduction if you as
[2:52:22.300 --> 2:52:28.940]  a business owner take a client or an employee or your partner out to eat and discuss business
[2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:37.620]  right well this actually has been brought back in 2021 in 2022 to support the businesses
[2:52:37.620 --> 2:52:44.780]  the restaurants that took a major beating you know during the covid so in order to the
[2:52:44.780 --> 2:52:49.700]  government in order to help them out has actually helped the small business owner out because
[2:52:49.700 --> 2:52:55.780]  now if you take your employees out to lunch it's no longer a 50% deduction it's 100%
[2:52:55.780 --> 2:52:59.820]  deduction and that's a big change and if you didn't know that's why I get so frustrated
[2:52:59.820 --> 2:53:05.460]  and Tyler just interrupt I get so frustrated because the system writes this for themselves
[2:53:05.460 --> 2:53:10.860]  they pay almost no tax and then the general public goes to regular CPAs or tax lawyers
[2:53:10.860 --> 2:53:14.500]  and they don't tell them about it or they charge them tons of money to do it you guys
[2:53:14.500 --> 2:53:18.700]  are completely different everybody needs to go to you and then they can just talk to you
[2:53:18.700 --> 2:53:24.700]  and your great crew of lawyers and CPAs and experts and then they can hear your story

[2:54:13.020 --> 2:54:16.820]  the McDonald's of this because you're just cutting right to the chase hey here's the
[2:54:16.820 --> 2:54:20.500]  fee here's the here's the deal here's what you're going to say that's just bam bam
[2:54:20.500 --> 2:54:29.120]  what I like is the fast delivery exactly so and and you know what the name of the game
[2:54:29.120 --> 2:54:33.660]  is this is about helping people at the end of the day and the more people that we can
[2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:38.100]  help I'm like you Alex that's what makes me happy that's what my passion is so give me
[2:54:38.100 --> 2:54:44.300]  a call because I'm here for you well it really makes me mad at other CPAs and tax groups
[2:54:44.300 --> 2:54:50.480]  because they do this molasses thing to like barely give people a few strategies to save
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:54.860]  a bunch of money but then they charge them like half of what that cost you guys are on
[2:54:54.860 --> 2:54:59.980]  average what most like 10% is what you're charging and what you're saving people it's
[2:54:59.980 --> 2:55:06.420]  just crazy give people a few examples of some of the services you've gotten how it works
[2:55:06.420 --> 2:55:13.220]  absolutely so the way that I like to group all of our services because we provide hundreds
[2:55:13.220 --> 2:55:20.260]  of different services is in the tax world Alex you pretty much have three separate zones
[2:55:20.260 --> 2:55:25.500]  okay you have the present that is you need to file this year's current taxes you want
[2:55:25.500 --> 2:55:30.500]  to take the most deductions as possible and pay the least amount right so that's tax prep
[2:55:30.500 --> 2:55:35.860]  we have the past and what that means is you already owe the IRS or the state money for
[2:55:35.860 --> 2:55:40.740]  whatever reason maybe we need to refile for you maybe you do owe more than you can afford
[2:55:40.740 --> 2:55:45.380]  to pay back if you owe more than you can afford to pay back we can negotiate with the government
[2:55:45.380 --> 2:55:49.620]  on your behalf there's multiple programs instead of letting it grow and grow and grow and ignore
[2:55:49.620 --> 2:55:56.940]  it till they come arrest you absolutely because as long as you're not doing anything about
[2:55:56.940 --> 2:56:03.700]  it it's penalties and interest and it's it's 5% a month plus 3% interest plus non filing
[2:56:03.700 --> 2:56:07.460]  none it just it's just compounds you double your tax debt in five years if you do nothing
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:19.180]  about it continue okay so excuse me here one thing I wanted to talk about as well when
[2:56:19.180 --> 2:56:26.340]  we're talking about businesses the small businesses is let's say you want to start a small business
[2:56:26.340 --> 2:56:31.660]  right but you haven't started it yet you may think well none of these costs that I have
[2:56:31.660 --> 2:56:36.380]  before I actually open my business are deductible because they're not business expenses that
[2:56:36.380 --> 2:56:41.220]  is not true and this is another thing that you know the IRS isn't going to tell you you
[2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.700]  have to have someone in your in your pocket or in your corner telling you this because
[2:56:45.700 --> 2:56:52.020]  the reality situation is you can write up up to $5,000 in pre business expenses for your
[2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:58.340]  startup company which is substantial for a startup company doesn't have that much capital
[2:56:58.340 --> 2:57:06.260]  doesn't need the additional tax bill when they are trying to make their first profits
[2:57:06.260 --> 2:57:10.220]  Jones tax relief dot com you're a great sponsor you're helping to stay on air and you're helping

[2:58:57.500 --> 2:59:02.020]  for this you were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had
[2:59:02.020 --> 2:59:07.020]  to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and deplatforming that cost
[2:59:07.020 --> 2:59:11.580]  tens of millions of dollars and now with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a
[2:59:11.580 --> 2:59:17.580]  day we're a platform for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their
[2:59:17.580 --> 2:59:25.580]  content free of charge and because it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and
[2:59:25.580 --> 2:59:30.740]  bandot video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but
[2:59:30.740 --> 2:59:35.900]  the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds
[2:59:35.900 --> 2:59:40.020]  of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale and info wars history is going right
[2:59:40.020 --> 2:59:44.900]  now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 percent off getting credible products and
[2:59:44.900 --> 3:00:00.100]  keep info wars as strong as ever if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[3:00:00.100 --> 3:00:22.320]  on that
[3:00:22.320 --> 3:00:24.040]  I guess a third or so of the questions,
[3:00:24.040 --> 3:00:26.680]  but where were we now here?
[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:29.120]  We were at ordinary and necessary expenses
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:30.440]  to run your business,
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:32.680]  or how does the little guy take advantage
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:34.680]  of the tax code like a big corporation?
[3:00:34.680 --> 3:00:36.960]  Let's hit a few of these final ones here.
[3:00:36.960 --> 3:00:37.920]  Let's hit them.
[3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:39.840]  There are a few things that I wanted to bring up.
[3:00:39.840 --> 3:00:43.880]  Okay, so for example, many people,
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:46.160]  our small business owners aren't of the impression
[3:00:46.160 --> 3:00:48.040]  that if they form an LLC,
[3:00:48.040 --> 3:00:50.720]  that has some sort of tax benefit to them.
[3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:51.720]  It does not.
[3:00:51.720 --> 3:00:53.160]  It protects you from getting sued.
[3:00:53.160 --> 3:00:54.120]  That's about it.
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:56.560]  Now, if you convert to an S corporation,
[3:00:56.560 --> 3:00:59.400]  you can save half of your self-employment tax,
[3:00:59.400 --> 3:01:01.120]  which is 15.5%.
[3:01:01.120 --> 3:01:03.600]  So simply creating an entity doesn't help you.
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:05.680]  You have to know what the correct entity to be in.
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:07.080]  And again, this is knowledge.
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:11.000]  It is not handed out to the public for a reason.
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:15.140]  Another example is, let's say you work for a company.
[3:01:15.140 --> 3:01:16.720]  You have a 401K.
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:20.840]  You're allowed to contribute $21, $21,000 a year to it, right?
[3:01:20.840 --> 3:01:23.160]  As a business owner, you can have a SEP IRA,
[3:01:23.160 --> 3:01:24.280]  and the limits are much higher.
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:25.920]  They're around $60,000.
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:27.800]  So it's just one of those things
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:31.160]  where the odds are stacked against the employee.
[3:01:31.160 --> 3:01:34.760]  And what I recommend everybody to do is start a side hustle.
[3:01:34.760 --> 3:01:36.240]  Find a hobby that you like to do
[3:01:36.240 --> 3:01:37.920]  that you can make money on and do it.
[3:01:37.920 --> 3:01:40.080]  Because then you can, if you're making money over there,
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:41.840]  you can even write off the taxes
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:44.080]  that you're paying on your W-2 income.
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:46.240]  And that's one way the little guy takes advantage.
[3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:50.720]  Another way is, let's just be talk macro for a second.
[3:01:50.720 --> 3:01:53.380]  The fattest section of the Internal Revenue Code
[3:01:53.380 --> 3:01:55.400]  is subsection C.
[3:01:55.400 --> 3:01:59.400]  What that is about, C corporations and C corporations only.
[3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:03.840]  There are so many loopholes that exist in C corporations
[3:02:03.840 --> 3:02:06.400]  because we're talking about the lobbies
[3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:08.480]  that control Apple, Microsoft,
[3:02:08.480 --> 3:02:10.520]  all the Fortune 500 companies are C-corps.
[3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:16.640]  And that same loopholes they use, we can lose as well.
[3:02:16.640 --> 3:02:19.520]  A major one is loaning money to yourself.
[3:02:19.520 --> 3:02:22.120]  You own a corporation and you make an arm's length
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:24.440]  transaction, you can loan yourself money.
[3:02:24.440 --> 3:02:26.640]  Remember, a loan is not income.
[3:02:26.640 --> 3:02:28.160]  So therefore it's not taxed.
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:30.400]  It's paid back, which-
[3:02:30.400 --> 3:02:32.640]  And that's one of the big ones people don't know.
[3:02:32.640 --> 3:02:35.760]  That's one of the big ones people don't know.
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:36.640]  Exactly.
[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:38.280]  That's a big one that people don't know
[3:02:38.280 --> 3:02:42.480]  that when I was studying for my LLM in tax school,
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:44.520]  that was pointed out to me as like,
[3:02:44.520 --> 3:02:47.440]  this is one of the best loopholes in the entire code.
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:49.320]  And it still exists.
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:51.200]  It's amazing.
[3:02:51.200 --> 3:02:52.040]  That's one.
[3:02:52.040 --> 3:02:55.440]  The other thing is people are scared of double taxation
[3:02:55.440 --> 3:02:56.520]  because of C-corps.
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:02:59.400]  That's relatively easy problem to eliminate
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:03.440]  through payroll and retaining profits in the corporation,
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:06.200]  which you cannot do with a flow through
[3:03:06.200 --> 3:03:09.000]  because you have to pay individual taxes on it.
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:11.920]  And so this is how the large corporations,
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:13.360]  I mean, we could talk about,
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:16.720]  we could spend a whole hour on international taxation,
[3:03:16.720 --> 3:03:17.720]  tax treaties-
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:19.360]  Absolutely. We'll come back on about all that
[3:03:19.360 --> 3:03:21.840]  because we should have you back about each subject,
[3:03:21.840 --> 3:03:23.560]  actually, because we could do a whole hour
[3:03:23.560 --> 3:03:24.880]  on each one of these, when we scratch the server,
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:27.080]  but exactly the average CPA or even lawyer
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:29.200]  doesn't even tell you about the right type of corporation.
[3:03:29.200 --> 3:03:31.000]  Why would they do that to people?
[3:03:33.600 --> 3:03:36.560]  Well, honestly, Alex, it's because the corporate laws
[3:03:36.560 --> 3:03:38.400]  and the laws surrounding entities,
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.560]  they change relatively often.
[3:03:40.560 --> 3:03:44.160]  And many, if you think of a CPA right now,
[3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:45.000]  I'm sure you're thinking-
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:45.840]  So it's a laziness.
[3:03:45.840 --> 3:03:47.680]  It's total complete laziness.
[3:03:49.200 --> 3:03:50.760]  Yes, they're not up to date
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:53.960]  on what the current hottest entities to be in are.
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:55.880]  And so they'll tell you, oh, LLC,
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:57.320]  why, because that was hot in the 90s,
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:03:58.640]  or they'll tell you S-Corp, why?
[3:03:58.640 --> 3:04:00.520]  Because that was hot even before that.
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.040]  So there are purposes for each type of entity,
[3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:08.080]  but since 2017, since the Republican tax overhaul,
[3:04:08.080 --> 3:04:10.120]  the C-Corp has been the most beneficial to be in
[3:04:10.120 --> 3:04:11.080]  if you're making money.
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:13.360]  Tyler Bennett, thank you so much.

[3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:54.560]  Absolutely, beautiful.
[3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:01.480]  If I had to describe with just one word,
[3:05:01.480 --> 3:05:05.560]  the brainwashing, the mind control,
[3:05:05.560 --> 3:05:10.560]  the asleep France that the general public is in,
[3:05:10.560 --> 3:05:15.200]  the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[3:05:15.200 --> 3:05:16.640]  Just like you're lost to sleep,
[3:05:16.640 --> 3:05:19.000]  you're lost in a bad nightmare,
[3:05:19.000 --> 3:05:20.560]  or you're in a car where you get knocked out
[3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:23.080]  and you've lost your bearings
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:28.080]  because you are totally dizzy and confused,
[3:05:28.120 --> 3:05:29.640]  you have a concussion.
[3:05:29.640 --> 3:05:30.920]  And that's what the globalists have done,
[3:05:30.920 --> 3:05:32.920]  they have stunned us.
[3:05:32.920 --> 3:05:36.200]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings,
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:38.320]  and then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[3:05:38.320 --> 3:05:40.160]  he called The Great New Narrative,
[3:05:40.160 --> 3:05:42.440]  where he brags how the public is lost,
[3:05:42.440 --> 3:05:45.240]  how the culture in the media has been driven
[3:05:45.240 --> 3:05:46.960]  to make sure the people are all alone,
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:50.040]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[3:05:50.040 --> 3:05:51.680]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:53.320]  They need darkness to thrive.
[3:05:53.320 --> 3:05:56.200]  The light lives at nfowars.com.
[3:05:56.200 --> 3:06:11.200]  gathered for a vision A vision
[3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:28.200]  JOSEPH WATSER
[3:06:30.200 --> 3:06:41.200]  Y'all live, it is the Summit News Hour for this March 31st, 2022, April 1st, tomorrow. Look out for those actual fake news headlines.
[3:06:41.200 --> 3:06:44.200]  Now, in this show, we're going to get on to later on.
[3:06:44.200 --> 3:06:56.200]  The astounding abuse of the refugee system as it pertains to the hundreds of thousands and indeed now millions of Ukrainian refugees flooding into European countries.
[3:06:56.200 --> 3:07:06.200]  The same people smugglers that abuse the system from 2014 to 2016 specifically with that huge wave of migrants flooding into Germany.
[3:07:06.200 --> 3:07:14.200]  Economic migrants that is not genuine asylum seekers are up to their old dirty tricks once again.
[3:07:14.200 --> 3:07:16.200]  I'm going to get into that later though.
[3:07:16.200 --> 3:07:23.200]  I think I'll start off with this headline because this actually came out at the end of last week, but I didn't get the chance to cover it on the show last week.
[3:07:23.200 --> 3:07:25.200]  Headline is poll.
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:31.200]  Majority of Democrats would flee the United States if it was invaded like Ukraine.
[3:07:31.200 --> 3:07:39.200]  You're telling me that the same people who are so vehement, so gleeful, so enthusiastic to support the current thing.
[3:07:39.200 --> 3:07:51.200]  If the current thing happened in America as it's happened in Ukraine, the same people that endlessly profess their support for the current thing with the Ukrainian flags in their Twitter bios,
[3:07:51.200 --> 3:08:02.200]  primarily that's their main method of hashtag activism, if it happened in the United States, the majority of Americans would flee the country.
[3:08:02.200 --> 3:08:13.200]  If China was dropping PLA troops in the major cities in America, they would hightail it in a second, despite their enthusiasm to support Ukraine.
[3:08:13.200 --> 3:08:21.200]  The new poll finds that the majority of Democrats, did I say Americans before? No, I meant Democrats obviously.
[3:08:21.200 --> 3:08:24.200]  The majority of Republicans actually would stay in flight.
[3:08:24.200 --> 3:08:30.200]  The majority of Democrats would flee the United States if it was invaded in a similar fashion.
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:34.200]  Say it ain't so, this is a Quinnipiac University poll.
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:41.200]  They surveyed 1,300 US adults nationwide margin of error, 2.6 percentage points.
[3:08:41.200 --> 3:08:48.200]  They were asked, well, if you were in the same position as the Ukrainians are now, do you think that you would stay and fight or leave the country?
[3:08:48.200 --> 3:08:55.200]  Now we know that a certain segment of the population, including Americans, many Europeans, have gone to fight in Ukraine.
[3:08:55.200 --> 3:09:02.200]  They've had some unfortunate circumstances to say the least, including medics, as I talked about last week,
[3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:13.200]  who go to Ukraine to support the war wounded, ended up getting their passports ripped up in front of their faces by the good guys, the Ukrainian authorities,
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:23.200]  and told they would have to go to the front lines, fight the war, and under martial law in Ukraine, they couldn't return home to America until the war ended,
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:25.200]  which could be months, it could be years.
[3:09:25.200 --> 3:09:37.200]  Well, now the same position, if Democrats were in the same position in America, they wouldn't even need to travel to another country to exhibit their esteemed morality to signal their virtue.
[3:09:37.200 --> 3:09:40.200]  The majority would flee.
[3:09:40.200 --> 3:09:48.200]  52% of Democrats said they would flee the country, while 68% of Republicans say they would stay and fight.
[3:09:48.200 --> 3:09:54.200]  They broke it down by demographics and found that 57% of whites said they would stay and fight.
[3:09:54.200 --> 3:09:58.200]  Along with an even greater number, 61% of Hispanics.
[3:09:58.200 --> 3:10:04.200]  However, only 38% of black people would stay and fight, while 59% would leave the country.
[3:10:04.200 --> 3:10:13.200]  So again, the majority of Democrats, which of course are prone to profess their virtue, their enthusiasm, their glee, their zeal,
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:20.200]  to support Ukraine, if it happened to America, they would not even support their own country.
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:24.200]  They would flee with their tail between their legs.
[3:10:24.200 --> 3:10:32.200]  And as I write in the article, the poll results emphasize how well many leftists are keen to display their support for Ukrainians under Russian Bob Barbon.
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:39.200]  By acts of moral exhibitionism, primarily by changing the Twitter bio, because that's really going to help them,
[3:10:39.200 --> 3:10:45.200]  and by lobbying for the banning, deplatforming, public shaming, public humiliation of anyone who engages in critical thinking,
[3:10:45.200 --> 3:10:54.200]  or thinks there's any nuance in this issue whatsoever, or thinks that maybe supporting a no-fly zone that would lead to nuclear Armageddon maybe isn't a good idea.
[3:10:54.200 --> 3:11:03.200]  Those people who will vilify you for doing that are more likely to flee the country if it happened in America.
[3:11:03.200 --> 3:11:10.200]  Obviously, we had the poll last week as well, which showed that there was a direct correlation in terms of people in Canada
[3:11:10.200 --> 3:11:16.200]  between vehemently supporting the lockdown measures, the mask mandates, and the mandatory vaccines.
[3:11:16.200 --> 3:11:22.200]  The same set of people, generally speaking, support military escalation in Ukraine.
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:31.200]  So, of course, you had the dichotomy between people being deathly afraid of a virus with a 99% plus survival rate for most age groups,
[3:11:31.200 --> 3:11:42.200]  completely living in fear, still living in fear to this day, by the way, even in England, where we've had the abolition of the mask mandates for over two months now,
[3:11:42.200 --> 3:11:50.200]  and you still get people in supermarkets, in hardware stores, where I go, literally cowering in fear if you go near them.
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:56.200]  They've still got their two masks on, they're fully jabbed like Hillary Clinton was, and she got Covid anyway,
[3:11:56.200 --> 3:12:02.200]  and yet if you go anywhere near them, they still flee in terror.
[3:12:02.200 --> 3:12:07.200]  And I'm going to talk more about Covid later on in the show, we have another headline here.
[3:12:07.200 --> 3:12:17.200]  Of course, skyrocketing energy prices both in the United States and in virtually every European country because of this war in Ukraine.
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:25.200]  Germany is dependent on its energy to the tune of 70% in some aspects on Russian oil.
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:35.200]  Well, now the government minister in Germany has told Germans that they should cope with soaring energy costs by simply wearing warmer sweaters.
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:40.200]  This is the government minister of agriculture and consumer protection, Peter Hawke.
[3:12:40.200 --> 3:12:47.200]  He made the comments as he called for a complete ban on German imports of Russian gas and oil as a result of the war in Ukraine.
[3:12:47.200 --> 3:12:52.200]  Who's going to pay for that? Well, Germans are going to pay for it with skyrocketing energy prices,
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:57.200]  but if they can't pay for it, well, they're just going to have to wrap up.
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:13:04.200]  Before the war began, Germany imported 55% of its gas from Russia along with a third of its oil and 45% of its coal.
[3:13:04.200 --> 3:13:11.200]  But with Germans already struggling to heat their homes, Hawke glibly told them to wear more clothing instead.
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:17.200]  And of course, in America, we have people being told to eat lentils and not give veterinary treatment to their pets.
[3:13:17.200 --> 3:13:21.200]  Maybe they should eat their pets because they're being told that they can't eat meat anymore.
[3:13:21.200 --> 3:13:29.200]  The German minister says, quote, you can withstand 15 degrees Celsius in winter in a sweater.
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:33.200]  No one dies of it, but people are dying elsewhere.
[3:13:33.200 --> 3:13:41.200]  So he's basically saying old people, the elderly who are already struggling with heating electricity gas bills,
[3:13:41.200 --> 3:13:43.200]  they should simply wrap up warmer.
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:50.200]  Well, of course, we know for older people, they're infinitely more at risk from hypothermia and all these other illnesses.
[3:13:50.200 --> 3:13:54.200]  If the temperature drops even to that level.
[3:13:54.200 --> 3:13:58.200]  So this is a proposal that would literally lead to the deaths of the elderly,
[3:13:58.200 --> 3:14:04.200]  the people who we were supposed to lock down society for and protect for the past two years.
[3:14:04.200 --> 3:14:10.200]  We were supposed to completely sacrifice our rights to mobility for their sake.
[3:14:10.200 --> 3:14:14.200]  But when it comes to this Russian oil situation, this energy dependence,
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:21.200]  they simply have to wear more sweaters, even though in that instance it would lead to scores to hundreds,
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:25.200]  hundreds of thousands even of old people dying.
[3:14:25.200 --> 3:14:29.200]  Eat your lentils, wear your sweaters and shut the hell up.
[3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:33.200]  German tenants association responded strongly to the comments,
[3:14:33.200 --> 3:14:38.200]  asserting that elderly people are at risk of death if they don't keep their homes sufficiently warm.
[3:14:38.200 --> 3:14:43.200]  But again, supporting the current thing is a little bit more important
[3:14:43.200 --> 3:14:46.200]  than the risk of catching hypothermia and dying.
[3:14:46.200 --> 3:14:48.200]  I mean, come on, just take the risk.
[3:14:48.200 --> 3:14:51.200]  Because we're a society all about taking risks, right?
[3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:54.200]  That's what's been proven for the past two years, surely.
[3:14:54.200 --> 3:15:00.200]  The technocrats really were happy, were comfortable with us taking the risk of catching a virus
[3:15:00.200 --> 3:15:05.200]  with a 99.7% survival rate for people, for example, in my age group.
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:12.200]  There were no risks taken then, but elderly people need to take the risk that they get hypothermia and die
[3:15:12.200 --> 3:15:15.200]  because Putin bad.
[3:15:15.200 --> 3:15:18.200]  German tenants association said, quote,
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:23.200]  with a ministerial salary or a presidential pension, you can afford exploding energy costs
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:26.200]  and do not need to freeze yourself again.
[3:15:26.200 --> 3:15:32.200]  Same equation when they push mass immigration in European countries like Sweden and Germany.
[3:15:32.200 --> 3:15:38.200]  You find the most aggressive lobbyists for mass immigration all live in the areas of the city,
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:45.200]  whether it be Berlin or Munich or wherever, where there is the least immigration from North Africa,
[3:15:45.200 --> 3:15:46.200]  from the Middle East.
[3:15:46.200 --> 3:15:52.200]  They want to propose these policies while not being subject to them to set themselves to any degree whatsoever.
[3:15:52.200 --> 3:15:55.200]  Summit.News will be back. No way.
[3:15:57.200 --> 3:16:01.200]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with knockout by InfoWarsLife.

[3:17:56.200 --> 3:18:00.200]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:02.200]  They financed major universities.
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:09.200]  They ran full page stories and advertisements pushing their propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers.
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:13.200]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing and must be ended.
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:17.200]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching.
[3:18:17.200 --> 3:18:23.200]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:27.200]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four national daughter.
[3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:29.200]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:31.200]  But I like to make it as well. I love to make breakfast.
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:37.200]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative.
[3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:40.200]  And then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:44.200]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding.
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:47.200]  It's our normal biological actions that are coming together.
[3:18:47.200 --> 3:18:54.200]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats.
[3:18:54.200 --> 3:18:56.200]  We cannot let this continue.
[3:18:56.200 --> 3:19:07.200]  If I had to describe with just one word the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep prince
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:22.200]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings
[3:19:22.200 --> 3:19:27.200]  because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[3:19:27.200 --> 3:19:28.200]  You have a concussion.
[3:19:28.200 --> 3:19:31.200]  And that's what the globalists have done. They have stunned us.
[3:19:31.200 --> 3:19:37.200]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings. And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:41.200]  called The Great New Narrative where he brags how the public is lost.
[3:19:41.200 --> 3:19:46.200]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:49.200]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:52.200]  That's what the great reset is. They need darkness to thrive.
[3:19:52.200 --> 3:19:57.200]  The light lives at infowars.com.
[3:19:57.200 --> 3:20:02.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[3:20:02.200 --> 3:20:07.200]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:24.200]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:24.200 --> 3:20:27.200]  Now, there was an astounding video which I'm going to play.
[3:20:27.200 --> 3:20:33.200]  I made a video about it myself with the bulk of the relevant content in the video.
[3:20:33.200 --> 3:20:42.200]  It was an Irish citizen journalist who went to Dublin Airport and he's keeping track of the Ukrainian refugees in comments
[3:20:42.200 --> 3:20:45.200]  that are entering Ireland over the course of the past few weeks.
[3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:51.200]  Of course, we had reports out of France a couple of weeks ago that a full third of, quote,
[3:20:51.200 --> 3:20:58.200]  Ukrainian refugees entering the country were actually from countries like Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria,
[3:20:58.200 --> 3:21:01.200]  these other North African countries predominantly.
[3:21:01.200 --> 3:21:09.200]  Well, now this citizen journalist visited Dublin Airport and he found that the Ukrainian refugees he expected,
[3:21:09.200 --> 3:21:16.200]  the kind of Slavic looking individuals who you might expect to turn up as they're fleeing from Ukraine,
[3:21:16.200 --> 3:21:22.200]  weren't quite as expected and I'm going to talk about another report after this video,
[3:21:22.200 --> 3:21:27.200]  which pertains to the situation which apparently is only getting worse.
[3:21:27.200 --> 3:21:31.200]  But here is the clip. This is Houston. We have a problem. Here it is.
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:38.200]  Well, remember I told you about how one third of the Ukrainian refugees arriving in France aren't even Ukrainian
[3:21:38.200 --> 3:21:44.200]  and that the system is being completely abused by economic migrants from countries like Algeria, Pakistan and India.
[3:21:44.200 --> 3:21:51.200]  Yeah, well, I wasn't making it up. This is what citizen journalist Philip Dwyer encountered outside Dublin Airport.
[3:21:51.200 --> 3:21:58.200]  Can I ask you a few questions? You've arrived here at the refugee centre here for Ukraine?
[3:21:58.200 --> 3:21:59.200]  Yes, sir.
[3:21:59.200 --> 3:22:00.200]  Are you Ukrainians?
[3:22:00.200 --> 3:22:01.200]  Yes, sir.
[3:22:01.200 --> 3:22:02.200]  Okay.
[3:22:02.200 --> 3:22:03.200]  Are you fleeing from?
[3:22:03.200 --> 3:22:04.200]  From Ukraine.
[3:22:04.200 --> 3:22:05.200]  From Ukraine.
[3:22:05.200 --> 3:22:07.200]  Yes, from Venice.
[3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:08.200]  Okay.
[3:22:08.200 --> 3:22:09.200]  See Venice.
[3:22:09.200 --> 3:22:10.200]  Yeah?
[3:22:10.200 --> 3:22:11.200]  Yes.
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:14.200]  Okay, so you don't look like you're from Ukraine?
[3:22:14.200 --> 3:22:17.200]  No, we're just national of Ukraine.
[3:22:17.200 --> 3:22:19.200]  You're just national of Ukraine, possible.
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:20.200]  Okay.
[3:22:20.200 --> 3:22:21.200]  So you're Ukrainian citizen?
[3:22:21.200 --> 3:22:22.200]  Yeah.
[3:22:22.200 --> 3:22:23.200]  Okay.
[3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:25.200]  You can say by origin we are from Sir Jamal Kashmir.
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:26.200]  From Kashmir?
[3:22:26.200 --> 3:22:27.200]  Yes.
[3:22:27.200 --> 3:22:28.200]  Yes.
[3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:29.200]  Okay, Indian.
[3:22:29.200 --> 3:22:30.200]  Okay.
[3:22:30.200 --> 3:22:33.200]  Yeah, so I'm just an Irish journalist there, citizen journalist.
[3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:38.200]  So I'm just asking, we're concerned here in Ireland that they're taking in 200,000 people.
[3:22:38.200 --> 3:22:39.200]  Okay.
[3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:45.200]  And we were being told that it's women and children are being taken in.
[3:22:45.200 --> 3:22:48.200]  So you're claiming refugee status here now?
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:49.200]  Yes, sir.
[3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:50.200]  Okay.
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:56.200]  So we just heard reports that there are people coming from Middle East, Africa or whatever,
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:00.200]  who aren't Ukrainians, who are coming in through this refugee centre.
[3:23:00.200 --> 3:23:05.200]  And we were told as Irish citizens that it's women and children, you know.
[3:23:05.200 --> 3:23:08.200]  So how do you feel about that?
[3:23:08.200 --> 3:23:15.200]  So these Ukrainian citizens, who are from Kashmir, were apparently able to escape Donetsk,
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:21.200]  a region controlled by Russia, slip into Ukraine and then on to Western Europe as part of the refugee wave,
[3:23:21.200 --> 3:23:28.200]  then into Ireland where no doubt they'll get immediate access to accommodation and welfare reserved for actual Ukrainian refugees.
[3:23:28.200 --> 3:23:33.200]  But wait, Ukraine has banned all males aged 18 to 60 from leaving Ukraine.
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:43.200]  Ah, but these guys are over the age of 60, which seems about as likely as this Ukrainian refugee family arriving in Ireland, being Slavic.
[3:23:43.200 --> 3:23:44.200]  And you're a Ukrainian citizen?
[3:23:44.200 --> 3:23:47.200]  Were you not asked to stay and fight for Ukraine?
[3:23:47.200 --> 3:23:49.200]  No.
[3:23:49.200 --> 3:23:52.200]  We are 60 years old.
[3:23:52.200 --> 3:23:53.200]  You're 60 years old?
[3:23:53.200 --> 3:23:54.200]  Yeah, we are old.
[3:23:54.200 --> 3:23:55.200]  Oh, you're 60?
[3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:56.200]  Yeah, and you're 60 as well.
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:23:57.200]  I'm this man.
[3:23:57.200 --> 3:23:58.200]  Nice to meet you.
[3:23:58.200 --> 3:23:59.200]  Yes, sir.
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:00.200]  And this man here is 60 as well.
[3:24:00.200 --> 3:24:01.200]  Are you from the Kashmir as well?
[3:24:01.200 --> 3:24:02.200]  No, no, no.
[3:24:02.200 --> 3:24:03.200]  Are you from Ukraine?
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:04.200]  Are you from Ukraine?
[3:24:04.200 --> 3:24:05.200]  Are you okay?
[3:24:05.200 --> 3:24:06.200]  You're from Ukraine, yeah?
[3:24:06.200 --> 3:24:07.200]  Okay, thank you.
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:10.200]  And what's your name, sorry?

[3:25:00.200 --> 3:25:06.920]  is only 5 million people. That's the equivalent of America accepting over 13 million new people.
[3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:11.880]  Given the scale of the operation, you'd think the vetting process would be a bit tighter, wouldn't you?
[3:25:14.840 --> 3:25:18.440]  Well there you have it and there's an update on this in terms of how this
[3:25:18.440 --> 3:25:23.960]  refugee way from Ukraine is being abused both by people, smugglers and economic migrants.
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:31.080]  Headlined today from Summit News report, quote, someone is making a fortune out of giving non-Ukrainian
[3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:37.720]  migrants fake Ukrainian passports. Now of course we remember the Paris massacre, we'd remember
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:42.840]  the other atrocities that beset Europe over the course of several years. At the end of the last
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:50.920]  decade, mainly premised on mainly driven by fake terrorists or fake refugees who were actually
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:57.960]  terrorist jihadists slipping into Europe on fake Syrian passports. Well now migrants, economic
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:03.560]  migrants are slipping into Europe on fake Ukrainian passports. Of course most of them aren't going to
[3:26:03.560 --> 3:26:07.640]  go on and become terrorists, they're just going to leech off the welfare system of these numerous
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:12.680]  European countries, some of whom are going to go on to be terrorists as we've learned to our costs
[3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:18.920]  over the past five, six years. But in this article there's actually an interesting photograph which
[3:26:18.920 --> 3:26:25.000]  was posted by a Twitter account called Ross Common GAA and it's about halfway down the
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:31.800]  article this tweet is embedded. They posted an image of the, quote, Ukrainian refugees that
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:38.120]  they invited to a Gaelic football match a few days ago in Ireland. Now if you look closely
[3:26:38.760 --> 3:26:45.560]  about half or almost half of these Ukrainian refugees don't appear to be very Ukrainian.
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:52.120]  Bear in mind Ukraine, unlike other Western European countries, isn't very diverse. Basically
[3:26:52.120 --> 3:26:59.240]  they've got a population of 99.9% white people. So if you're presenting this as an image of
[3:26:59.240 --> 3:27:06.120]  Ukrainian refugees who have entered Ireland, got accommodation, got free money, welfare,
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:09.400]  and in the future the Irish government has announced, as they also announced they're
[3:27:09.400 --> 3:27:16.280]  going to let in 200,000, they're going to build 35,000 homes for Ukrainian refugees.
[3:27:17.320 --> 3:27:23.000]  They're not Ukrainian refugees. This is going to take away welfare, take away accommodation,
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:27.560]  take away housing, not only from Irish people who were struggling in that aspect already,
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:33.880]  but from genuine Ukrainian refugees who are genuinely fleeing war, not people who are fleeing
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:39.960]  Pakistan, so they can get a free house in Ireland. That's not a Ukrainian refugee, but again,
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:44.920]  I guess it doesn't matter. As long as you say they're Ukrainian refugees, you get to feel
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:49.880]  good about yourself, you get some social media dopamine, and it doesn't matter. Even if literally
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:55.960]  in the act of that moral exhibitionism, you're depriving a genuine Ukrainian refugee of welfare,
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:28:02.120]  of refuge, and of a home. And they've got more problems in Germany, which of course they accepted
[3:28:02.120 --> 3:28:08.600]  over a million migrants back in 2015-16, many of whom weren't Syrian refugees, by the way.
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:13.160]  According to a report by German newspaper Build, quote, someone is making a fortune out of giving
[3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:18.520]  non-Ukrainian economic migrants fake Ukrainian passports so they can slip into Western Europe
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:23.720]  and get free welfare. There was basically a massive riot, which is commonplace in an asylum
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:29.960]  center in Munich. Build cited a police source who said, the overwhelming majority of the quote,
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:35.560]  refugees, were from the Sinti and Roma ethnic groups, gypsies, quote, only a fraction are really
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:40.920]  Ukrainian citizens, refugees, sorry. He said, quote, they have brand new Ukrainian passports,
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:45.720]  which are also real. Someone is making a fortune right now. The people smugglers,
[3:28:45.720 --> 3:28:50.840]  the criminals are abusing the system once again to the detriment of the German people
[3:28:50.840 --> 3:28:53.800]  and genuine Ukrainian refugees. Summit.News will be back.

[3:30:02.280 --> 3:30:07.240]  corporate media, by the controlled churches and the universities. And why is this the case?
[3:30:07.880 --> 3:30:13.080]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys for our own minds, our own psychies,
[3:30:13.080 --> 3:30:19.880]  our own souls. And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote,
[3:30:19.880 --> 3:30:25.320]  fallen or sinful state. So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things that we try to bring
[3:30:25.320 --> 3:30:31.560]  into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us. They're only making us more depressed.
[3:30:31.560 --> 3:30:36.600]  In the end, they're only making us less filled. It is only by going within and really making
[3:30:36.600 --> 3:30:41.320]  that connection to God that we can truly empower ourselves. That's why the globe was bombarded
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:46.440]  with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[3:30:46.440 --> 3:30:52.200]  our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[3:30:52.200 --> 3:30:55.160]  And that's where the incredible products come in at InfoWarsTour.com.
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:02.360]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at
[3:31:02.360 --> 3:31:07.800]  home and the world at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all
[3:31:07.800 --> 3:31:14.120]  use more of, our new sleep support formula, Down and Out, is just the thing. It's our new
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:19.800]  faster absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:25.160]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with Down and Out,
[3:31:25.160 --> 3:31:30.840]  now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[3:31:30.840 --> 3:31:36.040]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it. One of the
[3:31:36.040 --> 3:31:41.800]  other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native
[3:31:41.800 --> 3:31:47.640]  Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product
[3:31:47.640 --> 3:31:53.400]  when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be Down and Out. Selling it out now

[3:33:24.040 --> 3:33:33.400]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit Top News headquarters in the United Kingdom,
[3:33:33.400 --> 3:33:41.400]  it's Paul Joseph Watson. Now I mentioned earlier about that whole out of Canada. It showed that
[3:33:41.400 --> 3:33:48.520]  there was a direct correlation, a direct crossover between the same crazed lunatics who supported
[3:33:48.520 --> 3:33:53.560]  the most egregious lockdown measures and basically never wanted the mask mandates to end
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:34:00.120]  wanted mandatory vaccination for everyone. They're still on that jag to this day. No matter what
[3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:07.000]  laws are rescinded, what restrictions are lifted in what country, they're still desperate to follow
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:11.800]  that mindset down whatever rabbit hole it goes. Of course, we've seen where it goes in China
[3:34:11.800 --> 3:34:16.920]  with their disastrous zero COVID policy, which I'm going to talk about later. But for the time
[3:34:16.920 --> 3:34:21.560]  being, we're going to stick with Ukraine. We're going to go to this video. It gets into the refugee
[3:34:21.560 --> 3:34:28.840]  situation and some other aspects of this seemingly overnight transfer between the same people
[3:34:28.840 --> 3:34:35.080]  mindlessly supporting COVID lockdowns, mass vaccination programs, and supporting the new
[3:34:35.080 --> 3:34:41.640]  current thing, which is displaying their moral exhibitionism in favor of Ukraine, but not just
[3:34:41.640 --> 3:34:48.920]  Ukraine in favor of escalating this war to dangerous levels. This is called I support
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:51.880]  Ukraine. I'm going to play about half of this video and here it is.
[3:34:56.920 --> 3:35:02.280]  Let's check in on the current thing. Nowhere have people been more vehement to support the current
[3:35:02.280 --> 3:35:07.000]  thing than when it comes to Ukrainian refugees. This has led directly to economic migrants and
[3:35:07.000 --> 3:35:12.760]  students who definitely aren't Ukrainian or refugees, wantonly abusing the system at the
[3:35:12.760 --> 3:35:18.040]  expense of genuine needy Ukrainian refugees. We were delighted to have the opportunity to welcome
[3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:22.920]  a group of brave, resilient people to Dr Hyde Park today. They have traveled to Ross Common to
[3:35:22.920 --> 3:35:31.000]  find refuge from the horrors of the war in Ukraine. Who wants to tell them if the current
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:36.280]  thing is doing everything we can to support Ukrainian refugees? Does it matter that significant
[3:35:36.280 --> 3:35:43.800]  numbers of them appear to not be Ukrainian or refugees? Look at me, sure. Look at me, sure.
[3:35:43.800 --> 3:35:50.280]  Ukrainian. No. Here's more diverse Ukrainian refugees arriving in Bordeaux in France,
[3:35:50.280 --> 3:35:54.840]  where a full third of Ukrainian refugees were discovered to be economic migrants mainly
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:35:59.640]  coming from Africa. Apparently those Russian missiles were so powerful they moved Ukraine
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:04.840]  to a different continent. The Irish government is so keen to support the current thing that
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:12.760]  per capita equivalent of America accepting over 13 million, they vowed to take in 200,000 Ukrainian
[3:36:12.760 --> 3:36:18.280]  refugees, including these good old Slavic 60-year-olds who landed at Dublin Airport last week.
[3:36:23.640 --> 3:36:29.960]  Ireland says they'll build 35,000 new homes for Ukrainian refugees, even while Irish people
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:35.320]  themselves are struggling to find homes to accommodate the newcomers, presumably forgetting
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:40.440]  that refugees are only supposed to be refugees while there's a war on. Then they're supposed to go
[3:36:40.440 --> 3:36:45.800]  home and help their country rebuild. 200,000 is nothing. I'll pump those numbers up. Those are
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:51.320]  rookie numbers in this racket. The German Green Party is demanding Germany accept 8 to 10 million
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:57.880]  Ukrainian refugees. The entire Ukrainian population is only 41 million. Seems there just aren't enough
[3:36:57.880 --> 3:37:06.120]  Ukrainian refugees to go around. Kensington Council, hello. Where's my Ukrainian? Yes,
[3:37:06.120 --> 3:37:12.760]  I requested one two weeks ago now. Still no sign. Well, I'm keen to get one before the neighbors
[3:37:12.760 --> 3:37:19.880]  get theirs. Yes, they beat us to it with the Tesla and the Cockapoo. Yes, that's my request. Yes,
[3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:25.800]  quiet woman, perfect English, experienced cleaner, needs to find her own accommodation.
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:30.760]  Actual Ukrainian refugees seem to be a finite resource, which is why the current thing crowd
[3:37:30.760 --> 3:37:35.400]  is seemingly happy to import them from third world countries that have absolutely nothing
[3:37:35.400 --> 3:37:41.640]  whatsoever to do with Ukraine. Also note how current thing King President Zelensky is very keen
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:57.560]  on piggybacking regime narratives onto existing popular support for the current thing. Of course,
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:38:02.760]  green energy is completely shite, totally inadequate to meet demand, and has already
[3:38:02.760 --> 3:38:08.600]  almost bankrupted Western economies like Spain. It only leads to soaring energy costs that poor
[3:38:08.600 --> 3:38:13.640]  people can't afford to pay. But hey, if it's a key part of the current thing, maybe we all need
[3:38:13.640 --> 3:38:19.960]  to get behind it. What's next? Zelensky urging us to embrace drag queen story time or transgender
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:35.560]  representation in female sports as a crucial part of the war effort. Current thing, selective outrage,
[3:38:35.560 --> 3:38:41.400]  socially engineered outrage. The regime is so easily able to redirect people's cognitive
[3:38:41.400 --> 3:38:48.120]  impulses virtually overnight. It's both depressing and quite frightening. COVID war. The difference
[3:38:48.120 --> 3:38:53.560]  between a bog standard dictatorship and a ruthless totalitarian state is that a ruthless
[3:38:53.560 --> 3:38:59.560]  totalitarian state requires the aid of vast numbers of its own population to ideologically
[3:38:59.560 --> 3:39:04.280]  enforce it. And we're now well on the road to that society in the once free west.
[3:39:04.280 --> 3:39:09.800]  A poll in Canada found that vaccinated people are far more likely to risk World War 3 over
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:14.760]  Ukraine by supporting aggressive measures against Russia, while unvaccinated people are more likely
[3:39:14.760 --> 3:39:20.440]  to support diplomatic measures. NPCs seamlessly transferred from being deathly afraid of a virus
[3:39:20.440 --> 3:39:26.680]  which didn't kill 99% plus, depending on age group of people who caught it, to mindlessly
[3:39:26.680 --> 3:39:32.360]  lobbying for no fly zones and military escalation that could very well cause nuclear armageddon.
[3:39:32.360 --> 3:39:37.160]  Another poll found huge support for the current thing, support Ukraine. But when asked what they
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:42.360]  do if they were invaded like Ukraine, the majority of Democrats said they'd flee the country. It seems
[3:39:42.360 --> 3:39:47.800]  that mass support for whatever current thing the political class and the culture demands has become
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:53.480]  a form of cognitive addiction. Having incompletely atomized from their communities, their families,
[3:39:53.480 --> 3:39:58.680]  and their own culture, humanity is seemingly dependent on defining itself on lurching from
[3:39:58.680 --> 3:40:04.360]  one current thing crisis to another, then weaponizing it to ostracize publicly-shamed
[3:40:04.360 --> 3:40:10.040]  de-platform dissidents who dare suggest that all may not be as it seems. Support for the current
[3:40:10.040 --> 3:40:15.560]  thing is dependent on the vitriolic denunciation of those who don't support the current thing,
[3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:20.520]  much like anyone who merely questioned the efficacy of lockdown measures or mask mandates,
[3:40:20.520 --> 3:40:25.880]  was brutally smeared as a dangerous anti-vaxxer. You're either with the current thing or you're
[3:40:25.880 --> 3:40:32.120]  against it. There's no room for nuance or critical thinking, only total ideological compliance,
[3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:37.400]  and now it will be government enforced. Authorities are threatening giant fines and prison time for
[3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:42.120]  anyone displaying symbols that contradict the current thing. Public figures are being ordered
[3:40:42.120 --> 3:40:47.320]  to profess their unquestioning subservience to the current thing or face career ruination.
[3:40:47.320 --> 3:40:51.960]  Big tech giants openly welcome and facilitate threats of violence against those who don't
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:57.080]  support the current thing. Seems support for the current thing is always reliant upon state
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:03.320]  oppression, public humiliation, and establishment coerced consent. Meeted out against anyone who
[3:41:03.320 --> 3:41:08.280]  doesn't support the current thing, which is why the counter meme to the I support the current
[3:41:08.280 --> 3:41:14.760]  thing meme makes absolutely no sense. I support the opposite of the current thing. Cool story,
[3:41:14.760 --> 3:41:20.040]  bro, but those two things clearly aren't the same. There's absolutely no negative consequences for
[3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:26.840]  supporting the current thing. Social media dopamine, high status symbol signalling, establishment,
[3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:32.520]  endorsement. Whereas the consequences for opposing the current thing can be life deforming,
[3:41:32.520 --> 3:41:37.480]  de-platforming, being fired from your job, being ostracised by your friends and family,
[3:41:37.480 --> 3:41:43.240]  being made an example of by the establishment, prison sentences and punitive fines. There's
[3:41:43.240 --> 3:41:49.640]  an entire cancel culture, legacy media fact checker industrial complex that bludgeons people into
[3:41:49.640 --> 3:41:55.960]  accepting the received wisdom, the current thing, on pain of their lives being eviscerated and wrecked
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:42:01.080]  if they don't. I also think that a lot of the feckless zeal to support this new current thing
[3:42:01.080 --> 3:42:06.120]  is the lingering doubt that they were on the wrong side of history in relation to the previous
[3:42:06.120 --> 3:42:17.000]  current thing. A vaccine so good you get given eight free covid tests after taking a fourth dose
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:21.240]  of it. If only they get it right this time, maybe everyone will forget about the previous current
[3:42:21.240 --> 3:42:28.360]  thing. That is I support the current thing, you can go and watch the rest of that at summit.news.
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:32.200]  Meanwhile, on subject to the vaccine quickly before we go into the next segment,
[3:42:32.200 --> 3:42:36.760]  Health Minister Fia's wave of unvaccinated Ukrainian refugees entering Germany,
[3:42:36.760 --> 3:42:41.240]  they're not afraid of the fact that there's no proper vetting system in place whatsoever,
[3:42:41.240 --> 3:42:46.600]  which is why a lot of them arriving are from North Africa, they're more concerned about them not
[3:42:46.600 --> 3:42:51.800]  being fully vaccinated. We'll get into more on lockdown on the other side, summit.news don't go away.
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:43:02.360]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of 2021
[3:43:02.360 --> 3:43:10.280]  and sold out in 10 days. Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022
[3:43:10.280 --> 3:43:15.480]  is now being offered and I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:20.600]  historic coins and because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:28.920]  the front lines of the fight against these tyrants. So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new
[3:43:28.920 --> 3:43:35.960]  Liberty tree coin. It is powerful. Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have

[3:44:19.160 --> 3:44:23.560]  How is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom wall
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:29.560]  or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a chain reaction?
[3:44:29.560 --> 3:44:33.320]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas. First of all,
[3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:46.520]  I agree. Arrest Fauci, arrest Bill Gates, the COVID backs is poison. Beautiful. Yeah, there's ways
[3:44:46.520 --> 3:44:50.120]  that we could all be involved and we could all be affected. So that's what I'm calling about.
[3:44:50.120 --> 3:44:54.920]  God bless you Chris in Atlanta. I really, really appreciate you calling us today. Thank you so
[3:44:54.920 --> 3:45:02.840]  much. In December of 2021, info wars offered the first in a three part series, the 1776
[3:45:02.840 --> 3:45:09.800]  anti tyrant coin, and it sold out in 10 days. And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original
[3:45:09.800 --> 3:45:16.840]  powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today. Now the second coin, the
[3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:22.760]  Liberty tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again. It certainly
[3:45:22.760 --> 3:45:28.840]  needs to the front of operation. It is so historic. And it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson
[3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:33.640]  about the tree of Liberty being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and tyrants and more.
[3:45:33.640 --> 3:45:40.840]  See the coin for yourself at 1776 coin.com. It's also an info or store.com. It's amazing.
[3:45:40.840 --> 3:45:45.400]  There's only 10,000 of them. And as a founding member, if we're able to stay on the air,
[3:45:45.400 --> 3:45:50.680]  we're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:45:55.160]  So get your new tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776 coin.com.

[3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:17.080]  From London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with summit.news.
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:24.440]  Now we're going to explain to you how the letter Z, as I would say it,
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:28.520]  but as you say it in America, Z has been canceled completely.
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:33.240]  First, though, I want to get to the latest on the COVID lockdown situation,
[3:47:34.360 --> 3:47:38.520]  because of course we've got Fauci, we've got others suggesting that that nasty little smell
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:45.960]  that lurks in the background may indeed come back into prominence. We have Biden getting a fake
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:50.840]  fake set at least in front of a fake set getting his fourth booster shot.
[3:47:50.840 --> 3:47:55.800]  We have Kathy Griffin literally celebrating the fact that she got a fourth booster shot and
[3:47:55.800 --> 3:48:02.680]  immediately afterwards was given by CVS. Eight free COVID tests, because that really speaks to
[3:48:02.680 --> 3:48:08.760]  the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, doesn't it? The fact that after you get a fourth dose
[3:48:08.760 --> 3:48:15.720]  of it, you get given eight further free COVID tests for when you next catch COVID. Of course,
[3:48:15.720 --> 3:48:22.120]  Hillary Clinton, triple jabbed catch COVID, Jen Pesachie, the House White House Press Secretary,
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:27.640]  triple jabbed got COVID twice, many others, and that weird thing when they get it, they
[3:48:28.520 --> 3:48:32.120]  publicly released the fact that they've got COVID despite being triple jabbed,
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:37.800]  and then they thank the vaccine, because the vaccine's safe and effective, it's so effective
[3:48:37.800 --> 3:48:44.200]  that you can still catch COVID after taking three or four doses of it. Backcheckers say that isn't
[3:48:44.200 --> 3:48:50.600]  happening though. Biden bumbles around fake White House set, admits not sure why as he gets another
[3:48:50.600 --> 3:48:57.640]  COVID shot, they put him in front of another fake set, injected him on camera, and he basically
[3:48:57.640 --> 3:49:03.640]  bumbled around saying, quote, I'm not sure why I'm doing it on stage. He said, I've always thought
[3:49:03.640 --> 3:49:08.440]  that it discourages people getting the vaccination when they watch people get a needle in their arm,
[3:49:08.440 --> 3:49:14.440]  so I apologize for discouraging when he's actually allowed to go teleprompter free,
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:20.760]  and he has a good day in terms of his cognitive decline. You will get a few words of truth that
[3:49:20.760 --> 3:49:27.880]  slip out of Biden's bumbling dementia ridden mouth. Video, Rand Paul warns Biden is a national security
[3:49:27.880 --> 3:49:34.120]  risk because he's in cognitive decline. 100% fully vaccinated cruise ship suffers COVID
[3:49:34.120 --> 3:49:40.440]  outbreak. This was the Princess Cruise, that's the company, it's the Ruby Princess, that's the
[3:49:40.440 --> 3:49:46.440]  name of the ship. On the website it says they have a fully vaccinated only policy, staff or
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:53.320]  passengers, you're not getting on without triple jabbed or a negative COVID test. Well as they
[3:49:53.320 --> 3:50:01.000]  docked in San Francisco on the weekend, this 100% fully vaccinated cruise ship had, you guessed it,
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:07.560]  a COVID outbreak. Meanwhile, more than 20% of post lockdown Americans are not too happy for the
[3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:15.480]  first time ever. This is the general social survey which began in 1972, but for the first time since
[3:50:15.480 --> 3:50:22.680]  that date, more than 20% of post lockdown Americans describe themselves as not too happy for the first
[3:50:22.680 --> 3:50:30.760]  time. And the writer Noah Carl, who I saw in this article, explains that it's likely not due to
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:36.440]  deaths from COVID, it's due to the actual lockdown policies themselves, you can read more about that
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:43.400]  in the article. Meanwhile, in China, which has pursued a zero COVID policy for this entire time,
[3:50:43.400 --> 3:50:48.680]  currently has record COVID outbreaks. Well, what do you know? One of the most vaccinated countries
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:54.840]  on the planet, of course, one of the most brutalist draconian when it comes to lockdown on the planet,
[3:50:54.840 --> 3:51:01.080]  they were literally welding people inside their own homes, preventing crucial pharmaceutical
[3:51:01.080 --> 3:51:06.920]  deliveries, drugs preventing even food deliveries to some people. Well, now authorities in Shanghai
[3:51:06.920 --> 3:51:11.960]  are relying on robot dogs with loudspeakers strapped to their backs to enforce the latest
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:22.440]  round of COVID lockdowns. Shanghai has suffered over the past four weeks, more COVID cases than the
[3:51:22.440 --> 3:51:29.960]  entire two year pandemic period. Yes, there's zero COVID policy, their fully vaccinated population
[3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:36.600]  policy has been so successful that they've had more COVID cases in the past four weeks than they've
[3:51:36.600 --> 3:51:43.320]  had in the previous two years of the entire pandemic. Once again, because they didn't go for,
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:50.040]  can't say it, whisper it under your breath, herd immunity. They've got no herd immunity whatsoever
[3:51:50.040 --> 3:51:56.360]  in Shanghai. They dosed people with completely safe and effective vaccines that aren't effective.
[3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:03.960]  Now they've got their biggest COVID outbreak ever. And they've got robot dogs barking orders
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:08.520]  to them to stay in their homes and wear masks, even though they're doing that anyway.
[3:52:09.560 --> 3:52:14.280]  Now as promised, let's talk about how the letter Z has been cancelled. I'm going to come back and
[3:52:14.280 --> 3:52:21.320]  talk about more examples of this. But yes, indeed, on the at the behest of Ukrainian authorities,
[3:52:21.320 --> 3:52:27.960]  the letter Z has been canceled. Here's the clip. Say goodbye to the letter Z because it's been
[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:34.920]  canceled. That's Z for Americans. But I'm not going to say Z. It's Z. Ukrainian Minister for Foreign
[3:52:34.920 --> 3:52:41.000]  Affairs, Dmitry Kuleba, has demanded that the entire world ban the letter Z because it apparently
[3:52:41.000 --> 3:52:45.640]  represents Russia's assault on the country, demanding that the use of the letter be forbidden.
[3:52:45.640 --> 3:52:51.080]  Kuleba wrote on Twitter, quote, I call on all states to criminalize the use of the Z symbol
[3:52:51.080 --> 3:52:55.080]  as a way to publicly support Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine. Now lawmakers in
[3:52:55.080 --> 3:53:00.680]  Lithuania are trying to pass a law that would fine individuals and businesses 500 euros a time
[3:53:00.680 --> 3:53:05.640]  for using the letter. Better check if it's still open if you are planning a trip to the zoo this
[3:53:05.640 --> 3:53:10.360]  weekend. Yesterday's Euro Insurance Group announced that they had dropped the letter Z from their main
[3:53:10.360 --> 3:53:15.880]  logo because Putin bad reports suggest that zebras, zombies and the metal zinc are all now
[3:53:15.880 --> 3:53:20.600]  seriously considering rebranding themselves. German newspaper build reports that the use of
[3:53:20.600 --> 3:53:25.080]  the letter as a way of denoting support for Russia has been banned in numerous areas of the
[3:53:25.080 --> 3:53:30.760]  country. The letter Z becomes the latest casualty of Russophobia, with Siberian cats and Russian
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:36.120]  trees having also been canceled. World number one tennis star Daniel Medvedev also faces a ban
[3:53:36.120 --> 3:53:41.640]  from competing at Wimbledon in London unless he publicly denounces Putin. Despite the fact they
[3:53:41.640 --> 3:53:46.040]  already made a public statement calling for peace, because demanding universal ideological
[3:53:46.040 --> 3:53:50.760]  compliance to political narratives under the threat of total career and personal ruination
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:53:57.480]  is something that definitely only happens under totalitarian regimes like Russia. It's okay when
[3:53:57.480 --> 3:54:04.760]  we do it. Now again in one of the previous videos I talked about the seamless transfer virtually overnight
[3:54:04.760 --> 3:54:11.800]  between people again swallowing whole this entire Covid lockdown narrative and now the support Ukraine
[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:16.520]  current thing narrative. You saw it again with the tennis stars of course Novak Djokovic
[3:54:17.080 --> 3:54:24.280]  deported unceremoniously from Australia which that was planned all along for simply not even
[3:54:24.280 --> 3:54:30.840]  announcing whether he'd had the vaccine or not. They seamlessly switched that over too. Once Djokovic
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:36.840]  lost his world ATP number one tennis ranking because he was unable to compete in the Australian
[3:54:36.840 --> 3:54:43.480]  Open this other guy a Russian Daniel Medvedev took the number one ranking but then because he won't
[3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:49.960]  publicly prostrate himself and commit an act of ideological submission despite the fact he's
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:56.920]  already called for peace in Ukraine now he's going to get banned from Wimbledon too. Absolutely
[3:54:56.920 --> 3:55:03.800]  incredible a seamless transfer not only in the mass culpability of the public in terms of ideological
[3:55:03.800 --> 3:55:09.800]  compliance but in the way it's meted out to public figures who don't completely toll the line for
[3:55:09.800 --> 3:55:17.400]  the current thing. An update on that cancellation of the letter Z by the way Samsung changes name
[3:55:17.400 --> 3:55:25.880]  of Z smartphones to support Ukraine. They've banned branding of Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:33.080]  flip phones in certain Eastern European countries again because Vladimir Putin bad this is after
[3:55:33.080 --> 3:55:37.480]  the German embassy tweeted that security forces are quite keeping an eye on the use of the symbol
[3:55:37.480 --> 3:55:42.680]  absolute clown world behavior and it was after Zurich insurance group dropped the letter Z from
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:50.600]  their branding again to support Ukraine. We also have this headline out of summit news Ukraine
[3:55:50.600 --> 3:55:58.040]  demands removal of Slovenian flag because it looks a bit Russian yes the brave authorities and
[3:55:58.040 --> 3:56:03.560]  national guard in Ukraine who are facing down a Russian war machine are apparently apparently
[3:56:03.560 --> 3:56:09.800]  too precious to tolerate colors that look a bit Russian this is an actual news story it isn't
[3:56:09.800 --> 3:56:15.560]  out the Babylon be. Russophobia has spread to colors anything that looks a bit Russian is now
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:21.400]  prone to cancellation bear in mind Slovenia is a country that has supported Ukraine at every
[3:56:21.400 --> 3:56:27.160]  step of the way their prime minister visited the country their prime minister has lobbied for
[3:56:27.160 --> 3:56:32.200]  Ukraine to be able to join the EU no that's not enough you got a flag that has red white and blue
[3:56:32.200 --> 3:56:38.120]  in it yet cancelled quote when we arrived in Kiev it was quite windy and when we proudly raised
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:42.920]  the Slovenian and European flags back they fluttered in the wind said the charge affairs
[3:56:42.920 --> 3:56:49.080]  Boston Leziak in an interview with TV Slovenia however a couple of days later after the wind
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:56.520]  died down the Slovenian flag slumped on the flagpole and it looked a bit too Russian for the precious
[3:56:56.520 --> 3:57:02.120]  members of the Ukrainian national guard they asked if the embassy could quote temporarily
[3:57:02.120 --> 3:57:09.080]  remove the Slovenian flag because it's too similar to the Russian one and no they weren't laughed at
[3:57:09.080 --> 3:57:16.520]  they were adhered to and the flag was removed absolutely incredible meanwhile Ukrainian
[3:57:16.520 --> 3:57:21.880]  soldiers filmed themselves calling up mothers of Russian soldiers killed in action and mock
[3:57:21.880 --> 3:57:28.360]  their mothers this was a footage posted to twitter a few days ago and once again the good guys are
[3:57:28.360 --> 3:57:35.960]  having a laugh at the expense of Russian mothers who have lost their sons in this tragic war again
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:41.240]  that is the good guys who we should all support without question that's going to wrap it up
[3:57:41.240 --> 3:57:47.720]  summit not news war room is coming up next don't go away you know it's a fact and i'm not bragging
[3:57:47.720 --> 3:57:53.800]  when i say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as the standard of human
[3:57:53.800 --> 3:58:02.200]  liberty as the logo of human populace resistance against their transhumanist anti-human program
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:10.200]  and man our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done so
[3:58:10.200 --> 3:58:16.200]  i'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products thousands of them at info wars
[3:58:16.200 --> 3:58:21.720]  store.com and we are funded by listeners and viewers like you and so now we need to support
[3:58:21.720 --> 3:58:27.240]  more than ever because this fight has intensified don't need me to tell you that at info wars

[3:58:45.480 --> 3:58:53.480]  now there is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class not in
[3:58:53.480 --> 3:59:01.320]  communist china not in mexico not in the united states not anywhere is there a real study of the
[3:59:01.320 --> 3:59:06.440]  planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks that basically control the
[3:59:06.440 --> 3:59:13.480]  planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the anglo-american establishment
[3:59:13.480 --> 3:59:16.840]  that's out of the builder bird group the trilateral commission of the united nations
[3:59:16.840 --> 3:59:23.000]  the whole project of the ross shawls and the rock folks until 10 years ago the media said the control
[3:59:23.000 --> 3:59:27.640]  corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist well now the builder bird group is public
[3:59:27.640 --> 3:59:33.240]  its former head still on the steering committee is claus schwaub and he has set up the great
[3:59:33.240 --> 3:59:38.520]  reset at global government and if as a liberty movement worldwide we don't address the globalist
[3:59:38.520 --> 3:59:43.240]  head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover we don't
[3:59:43.240 --> 3:59:50.360]  have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily leading a frontal assault on the lies of
[3:59:50.360 --> 4:00:15.320]  the new world order it's alex jones
