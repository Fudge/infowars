[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:09.712]  We focus a lot about what's going on and trying to fight it, and I think that's probably the right thing to do, but I think we also need to be able to boil it down and recognize what's real.
[00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:14.294]  And at this point, these people are going for broke.
[00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:15.915]  They're not going to stop.
[00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:30.112]   Whatever they want out of it, whether it's depopulation or You know, just control and power and being able to control us as slaves, whatever it is, we need to recognize that's the goal and they're going for it.
[00:00:31.052 --> 00:00:36.816]  And we need to distance ourselves from that and just, you know, they want to play their games.
[00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.977]  Well, why don't we just start playing our own?
[00:00:39.517 --> 00:00:43.279]  And we gotta, you know, we're all stuck in this corporate world.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:01:00.274]   Everybody's working a nine to five, Brooke, trying to, uh, Just get by and we need to start taking the extra time that we have after our jobs and start talking to each other and we need to start working on things, side projects, and get ourselves out of it.
[00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:02.396]  I think that's our only option.
[00:01:02.576 --> 00:01:02.896]  You're right.
[00:01:02.936 --> 00:01:04.237]  We have to build the new world.
[00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:05.838]  We're in the world but not of it.
[00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:13.504]  We have to recognize that everything they're doing is assaulting us and only support grassroots and mom and pops and independents and realize we're under attack.
[00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:23.411]   We didn't ask for this fight but they started it and as I've said a thousand times, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one, brother.
[00:01:23.552 --> 00:01:25.813]  And that is exactly where we are.
[00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:30.117]  We have to recognize that, not as victims, but as overcomers.
[00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:34.280]  And that's basically the whole slogan and everything InfoWars stands for.
[00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.801]  And that's who we are.
[00:01:36.422 --> 00:01:45.849]  And once everybody realizes these people aren't stupid, the goal for their job is just different, then it really makes them wonder.
[00:01:47.446 --> 00:01:48.427]  That's what we need to do.
[00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:49.908]  We need to get people to think about that.
[00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.210]  Well, that's right.
[00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.895]  Once you realize it's a predatory worldview where they've given up on God, they've joined with evil, then it all makes sense.
[00:01:56.935 --> 00:01:58.236]  And their own writings admit that.
[00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.940]  The Davos Group, no more free will, getting rid of your family, getting rid of humans.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.661]  This is psychotic.
[00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.444]  These people are the worst people on earth.
[00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:07.485]  They're beyond creepy.
[00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:19.504]  They are bad news, brother.
[00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:40.313]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:41.214]  InfoWars.
[00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:43.056]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.923]  It's a helpless feeling when your baby is upset and you're uncertain about how to best meet his or her needs.
[00:02:54.383 --> 00:03:00.426]  Imagine the desperation some moms are feeling seeing these empty shelves if they rely on baby formula.
[00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:07.930]  Store after store has little to no baby formula left to buy or is rationing what they do have left.
[00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.931]  Even The Atlantic admits this has become a full-blown national crisis.
[00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:17.732]  Many states are now at least 40% out of stock, according to Data Assembly.
[00:03:18.193 --> 00:03:25.815]  Legacy Media is partly blaming the pandemic, but there's also the issue of a major manufacturer, Abbott Nutrition, remaining shuttered.
[00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:31.236]  The FDA has not let them resume production since a voluntary recall in February of this year.
[00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:36.000]  The facility says it will be at least two more months before his formula can fill the shelves again.
[00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:40.485]  House Republican Dusty Johnson of South Dakota says that's unacceptable.
[00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:44.589]  He's blaming the FDA for dropping the ball and is urging it to do more.
[00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.732]  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is also fired up.
[00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:54.598]  Forty billion dollars, but there's no baby formula for American mothers and babies.
[00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:04.108]  But if you dare even acknowledge this crisis, all these empty shelves, then Democrat Representative Jamie Raskin will say you're just repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation.
[00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:14.732]  Here's a formula for the destruction of democracy, repeating Putin's propaganda and disinformation, and appeasing imperialist assaults on sovereign nations.
[00:04:15.092 --> 00:04:22.574]  If this is about claiming that it's about saving lives, let's be real, then we would care about war-torn countries like Ethiopia.
[00:04:22.614 --> 00:04:26.914]  So that's a bunch of hypocrisy, because I never hear Ethiopia brought up here.
[00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:31.976]   So while we've sent more than 54 Billion to Ukraine this year.
[00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:34.697]  What is being done about these empty shelves?
[00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:37.278]  Wait, these shelves look full?
[00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:40.140]  Oh, that's a processing center on the U.S.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.661]  border, according to Florida Congresswoman Kat Kamek.
[00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:54.274]   Absolutely have to share with you right now is the craziness of the empty shelves Biden movement and the fact that they are sending pallets Pallets of baby formula to the border.
[00:04:54.694 --> 00:04:59.777]  Meanwhile, in our own district, at home, we cannot find baby formula.
[00:05:00.037 --> 00:05:05.760]  But have no fear, Bill Gates and billionaire crew conveniently have had a backup plan in the works.
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:15.645]  From a 2020 article in Science Times, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, other billionaires invest in environmentally friendly artificial breast milk cultured from human mammary.
[00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:18.347]  Oh hey, isn't that convenient?
[00:05:19.128 --> 00:05:21.230]  Dr. Syed Haider has a different take.
[00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.356]  And so I would recommend don't use the stuff that's available in the stores ever again.
[00:05:28.096 --> 00:05:33.622]  This is a good time to find a good alternative for your breastfeeding or for your child formula needs.
[00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:42.167]  Because if you read the ingredients on the breast milk in the stores, it's a bunch of junk, honestly.
[00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:48.069]  It's a bunch of oils that I wouldn't recommend that human beings use and a bunch of other sugars.
[00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:52.471]  There's a lot of sugar in all the infant formulas.
[00:05:53.232 --> 00:05:56.273]  And so making your own is actually far, far better.
[00:05:56.963 --> 00:06:00.624]  Now on cue, this is contrary to what the mainstream media is advising.
[00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:04.005]  CNN, homemade infant formula can be dangerous.
[00:06:04.466 --> 00:06:09.467]  Misinformation about how families can get through infant formula shortage is fueling concern.
[00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:17.090]  But the non-profit Weston Price Foundation has been around for more than 20 years, offering an at-home recipe many moms swear by.
[00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.171]  Other moms are recommending goat's milk as an alternative.
[00:06:20.191 --> 00:06:22.832]  So goat milk isn't the perfect substitute for human breast milk.
[00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:27.253]  It doesn't have all the same things that human breast milk does, all the same nutrients.
[00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:31.934]  There's different levels of different nutrients in the goat milk and in cow milk.
[00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:37.816]  So if you want to try to mirror human breast milk as closely as possible, then I would recommend the Weston Price formula.
[00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:38.916]  You can find that online.
[00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.377]  Just Google Weston Price Foundation.
[00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:42.717]  Baby formula.
[00:06:43.658 --> 00:06:48.080]  And it's got a whole lot of stuff, and you're not going to have everything on hand, so you're going to have to order some things.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.642]  It's got all these different oils that you add in, and you've got to really mix it up really well, otherwise it separates.
[00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:55.583]  Yeah, Weston Price, it gives a recipe of how you do it.
[00:06:55.603 --> 00:06:57.564]  Yeah, they have a recipe, and it's kind of complicated.
[00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:00.706]  So you're not going to have everything at home, I guarantee you.
[00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:11.129]   There's a lot of different specific oils that you add so that you get the right level of omega-3s and the right level of DHA and EPA and so they're trying to mirror human breast
[00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.788]   milk as closely as possible and it's really important for brain development to have something that is
[00:07:15.788 --> 00:07:18.169]  as close as possible to human breast milk.
[00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.009]   Perhaps the silver lining in this is that for those that are able to,
[00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.049]  they'll heed the advice that breast is best.
[00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:31.449]   The world is really starting to wake up to the fact that whether it's Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab or
[00:07:32.968 --> 00:07:39.127]  Trudeau up in Canada or Joe Biden and Obama here.
[00:07:39.332 --> 00:07:40.213]  Or Prince Charles.
[00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:47.940]  That these people are creepy authoritarian dictators that absolutely hate us and hate our guts.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:58.309]  And we're going to have to decide whether we're going to allow them to dismantle civilization and de-industrialize us and make us abject poor serfs if we're lucky and live.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.601]  The direction they're taking us on record is war and famine and death and destruction.
[00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:11.763]  And I, for one, am not going to just sit here and take it.
[00:08:11.963 --> 00:08:17.704]  And I want this to sink into the listeners and viewers on this Friday, May 13th broadcast.
[00:08:18.783 --> 00:08:20.783]  I guess that's Friday the 13th.
[00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:27.423]  This broadcast is...
[00:08:28.016 --> 00:08:37.259]  Is the largest, most effective pro-human, populist, resistance platform in the world.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.141]  And I don't say that with enjoyment.
[00:08:41.321 --> 00:08:45.282]  Because we're ragtag, we're small, and we're barely hanging on.
[00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:47.623]  And we're having a bigger effect than we've ever had.
[00:08:48.904 --> 00:08:52.905]  And my enemies are massive.
[00:08:53.365 --> 00:08:54.406]  Your enemies are massive.
[00:08:55.450 --> 00:09:03.935]  I know that as their evil plan unfolds, more people will wake up by necessity and realize that we must stop complying with this New World Order.
[00:09:04.675 --> 00:09:08.197]  It's designed to get us to carry out violence, and they think they can win that.
[00:09:08.277 --> 00:09:19.463]  They know intellectually, long term, they're going to lose in a fight with us in a velvet glove approach because what we're promoting is good and wholesome and makes sense and works.
[00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:22.985]  What they're promoting is absolutely psychotic and out of control.
[00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:27.270]  I mean here's an example, here's several examples.
[00:09:28.271 --> 00:09:29.532]  Everything I tell you here is true.
[00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:33.294]  Occasionally I make a mistake but 99% of the time it's dead on.
[00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:45.121]  And I told you last year they have a bunch of grand juries open trying to indict myself and Roger Stone and others and now that's in the news that they have these grand juries open on us and that we're quote the main targets.
[00:09:46.282 --> 00:09:47.063]  For January 6th.
[00:09:48.023 --> 00:09:48.944]  Even though we try to stop it.
[00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:51.966]  Even though Democrats are everywhere calling for violence right now.
[00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.111]  We're calling for peace.
[00:09:55.051 --> 00:09:56.853]  They say 1776 means violence.
[00:09:56.913 --> 00:09:59.514]  No, it means the answer in 1984 equals 1776.
[00:09:59.554 --> 00:10:01.096]  We're in an info war.
[00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:03.497]  Info war means information war.
[00:10:04.078 --> 00:10:05.359]  The pen is mightier than the sword.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.783]  But that doesn't get me down knowing that they want to put me in prison.
[00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:12.624]  I already know that.
[00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:14.065]  They're putting us all in prison.
[00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:17.347]  What do you think the COVID police state power grab rollout is?
[00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:20.590]  Here's another example.
[00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:32.633]  I told you that we were really 2-3 million dollars in the red and that I wouldn't have money to buy the product that funds us into the future if I didn't get 2-3 million dollars.
[00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:34.274]  2 million bare minimum.
[00:10:35.075 --> 00:10:38.517]  And when I got a million dollar Bitcoin donation, I came on here and I told everybody.
[00:10:39.468 --> 00:10:44.313]  The media ran articles about it a few days later, like I had been caught with Bitcoin, it was illegal and I was bad.
[00:10:44.653 --> 00:10:46.134]  Everything we do, they turn around backwards.
[00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:48.657]  Then we got another million dollar donation, now worth about $700,000.
[00:10:50.038 --> 00:10:51.900]  I'm holding on to it though, hopefully it goes back up.
[00:10:52.461 --> 00:10:54.563]  I need all that money to fund our operation.
[00:10:55.323 --> 00:11:05.473]   As soon as I told the listeners that we brought in $2 million, donations and purchases went way down, and now We're already about to go back into the red.
[00:11:05.613 --> 00:11:07.294]  And see, I didn't think like a Machiavelli.
[00:11:07.814 --> 00:11:14.978]  Oh, if I tell people I've gotten millions of dollars and thank whoever this anonymous donor is, they'll think I don't need help and will stop giving.
[00:11:15.018 --> 00:11:15.698]  I don't even think like that.
[00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:21.341]  I just tell you the truth about the world and what we're seeing and what's happening and what's going on with us.
[00:11:21.901 --> 00:11:25.063]  And then I don't think about the consequences with my policy of truth.
[00:11:26.414 --> 00:11:28.656]  And overall, it's been a good policy in my life.
[00:11:29.336 --> 00:11:34.680]  And I've gone from being someone that rarely lied to someone that neurotically now tells the truth.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:48.810]  And once you start doing that, your brain gets to where it doesn't have to think about stories or backup stories or, you know, oh, let me dial this back or let me shade this because it might hurt somebody's feelings or might hurt me.
[00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.072]  You just start telling the truth all the time.
[00:11:52.173 --> 00:11:55.275]  And it is so powerful and so strong.
[00:11:57.099 --> 00:12:03.444]  And you conversely compare that to Jen Psaki, and this whole show today is about their lies.
[00:12:05.185 --> 00:12:17.455]  I've got clips of her saying there is no baby formula shortage, even though the FDA admits because of three plants they ordered shut down, and supply chain problems, that there are massive shortages.
[00:12:18.776 --> 00:12:19.956]  She says it's hoarding.
[00:12:20.962 --> 00:12:22.822]  And that it's your fault when that's not even true.
[00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:24.403]  There's no baby formula to hoard.
[00:12:25.403 --> 00:12:26.323]  It's sold out everywhere.
[00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:27.043]  For weeks.
[00:12:27.403 --> 00:12:28.543]  Months and months waiting list.
[00:12:31.764 --> 00:12:33.824]  They also told you last year there was no inflation.
[00:12:34.224 --> 00:12:35.665]  Then they told you inflation was good.
[00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:38.245]  Now they say the inflation's your fault.
[00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:39.585]  The Republicans' fault.
[00:12:39.946 --> 00:12:40.626]  Populist's fault.
[00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:58.418]   And then in the same press conference she says there are no crack pipes being given out To crackheads when they funded over 10 million dollars in the COVID package last year specifically for communities in quote need.
[00:12:58.518 --> 00:12:59.519]  I have the bill number.
[00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:01.241]  I have the government document.
[00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:02.802]  I have the subsection.
[00:13:03.082 --> 00:13:06.686]  I have the government website with the damn crack pipes on it.
[00:13:07.346 --> 00:13:08.848]  They then say they're not doing it.
[00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:24.428]   So people go into the Welfare centers, they go into the health departments and they're given the stinking federal packages in the stinking federal container telling them it's from the federal government.
[00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:34.372]  Now why would Psaki, six months after this broke, get up there when somebody asked her about it and say that's a conspiracy theory?
[00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:39.434]  Because they're training you to lie to your face.
[00:13:41.547 --> 00:13:51.794]  We've got all the big news in Russia and inflation and the borders and the war and so much to cover, but just the insulting, constant lies.
[00:13:51.874 --> 00:13:56.257]  I mean, if I lied to you on a routine basis and you caught me, you would not like me.
[00:13:56.678 --> 00:13:57.939]  And I wouldn't like myself.
[00:13:58.479 --> 00:13:59.720]  And you would stop listening.
[00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:01.781]  And that's the weird paradigm.
[00:14:01.962 --> 00:14:02.782]  They don't have listeners.
[00:14:03.002 --> 00:14:03.743]  They don't have viewers.
[00:14:04.103 --> 00:14:04.944]  Biden has events.
[00:14:05.164 --> 00:14:05.844]  100 people show up.
[00:14:06.064 --> 00:14:06.965]  His wife sells a book.
[00:14:07.165 --> 00:14:11.185]   She sells 244 Copies?
[00:14:12.487 --> 00:14:27.381]  But we're told, ladies and gentlemen, we're told that he was elected in this giant landslide and none of that was true.
[00:14:29.703 --> 00:14:30.744]  And we know it's not true.
[00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:35.568]  And then we're told by the FBI, the Justice Department, oh, that's what terrorists do.
[00:14:36.837 --> 00:14:44.664]  They put up web graphics on NBC News and ABC News and Fox and CNN saying, here are the signs of being a terrorist.
[00:14:45.125 --> 00:14:50.250]  You question lockdowns and inoculation, and you question stolen elections.
[00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:52.372]  Think about that.
[00:14:55.635 --> 00:15:02.001]  So, they've always handed out needles to heroin heads, and that's probably a good thing because they can give each other HIV by sharing them.
[00:15:03.251 --> 00:15:21.756]  But the argument that people need fresh, clean crack pipes is preposterous, and they're doing it while telling you and myself and the whole world to our face, we're not giving out crack pipes.
[00:15:23.376 --> 00:15:24.557]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:15:24.797 --> 00:15:29.478]  It's like saying, it's a conspiracy theory that the Statue of Liberty is off the coast of Manhattan.
[00:15:31.673 --> 00:15:34.176]  It's a conspiracy theory that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican.
[00:15:35.017 --> 00:15:37.600]  It's a conspiracy that George Washington was our first president.
[00:15:38.761 --> 00:15:41.424]  It's a conspiracy theory that Alex Jones is wearing a black shirt.
[00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:45.909]  It'd be like if I was on TV right now saying, I'm not wearing a black shirt, this is a white shirt.
[00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.273]  And you're sitting there looking at a black shirt going, no it's not.
[00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:52.460]  What is the psychology of that?
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.502]  And it's training you to accept lies and just get over it and that they're going to lie to you and that's it.
[00:15:57.562 --> 00:15:59.143]  This is behavioral psychology.
[00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:00.424]  It's disgusting.
[00:16:00.744 --> 00:16:07.988]  And how you handle it is totally break with these people and just realize they're the enemy and realize our government's occupied by criminals and realize they're looting us.
[00:16:08.048 --> 00:16:11.169]  I mean, my God, folks, inflation's at 11% right now.
[00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:12.730]  That's their number.
[00:16:16.212 --> 00:16:17.693]  I mean, annual?
[00:16:18.939 --> 00:16:19.500]  Eleven percent.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.682]  It's devastating.
[00:16:21.323 --> 00:16:22.925]  Devastating.
[00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:24.067]  And it's accelerating.
[00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:27.040]  And they're up there making jokes and laughing about it.
[00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:28.962]  Completely out of their minds.
[00:16:29.002 --> 00:16:35.006]  Because this is the scum that BlackRock and the big banks got that would do traitorous stuff like this to their own families.
[00:16:35.226 --> 00:16:36.908]  Because it'll come back on all these people too.
[00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:38.949]  So we've gone over the edge.
[00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:40.110]  We're in the collapse.
[00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.812]  And we just cannot have a violent civil war.
[00:16:43.172 --> 00:16:46.355]  And we cannot let them rope us into that because that's their final coup d'etat.
[00:16:46.635 --> 00:16:48.236]  And we've got to stop a wider war with Russia.
[00:16:48.556 --> 00:16:49.477]  We'll talk about it all today.
[00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:50.858]  We've got a big broadcast coming up.
[00:16:50.918 --> 00:16:52.979]  I'll play those soccer clips I talked about when we come back.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.400]  Stay with us.
[00:16:54.827 --> 00:16:57.930]  Can't trust nothing but the love in your mama's eyes.
[00:16:59.311 --> 00:17:01.172]  We haven't had Tudor Jennings on in about eight years.
[00:17:01.212 --> 00:17:02.513]  We should get him back on.
[00:17:02.593 --> 00:17:04.355]  Waylon Jennings, amazing son.
[00:17:08.438 --> 00:17:12.381]  The gas mask is the couture of the summer of rage.
[00:17:13.042 --> 00:17:18.866]  They're building mass graves when they forcibly vaccinate for the police state.
[00:17:20.027 --> 00:17:20.868]  And now here we are.
[00:17:21.929 --> 00:17:23.030]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:26.698]  Told you.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.781]  We are back live.
[00:17:31.482 --> 00:17:33.643]  Salvation is in your mother's eyes.
[00:17:35.424 --> 00:17:37.646]  The Summer of Rage, Shooter Jennings.
[00:17:40.648 --> 00:17:43.370]  Can't trust nothing but the love in your mother's eyes.
[00:17:45.291 --> 00:17:46.772]  Hush, hush, little child.
[00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:50.531]  That's where we are.
[00:17:50.571 --> 00:17:51.371]  That was the plan.
[00:17:51.651 --> 00:17:53.372]  How did I know 12 years ago?
[00:17:53.432 --> 00:17:59.797]  How did I inspire Shooter Jennings to have a hit song about the forced inoculation and the takeover?
[00:18:01.098 --> 00:18:05.080]  Because it's been their damn plan the entire time.
[00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:17.008]  And I don't want to be here in a few years, off air, with a total lockdown, with everybody saying Alex Jones was right when people are being shipped off to FEMA camps.
[00:18:17.288 --> 00:18:19.350]  Are you gonna let them get to the next point?
[00:18:21.428 --> 00:18:23.429]  And that's why I'm going to say something key before I hit all this news.
[00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.851]  When callers call in, we're going to have open phones again today and I love you to death.
[00:18:26.891 --> 00:18:29.333]  Please, I thank you, you thank me, we don't need to say it.
[00:18:31.614 --> 00:18:32.755]  Because I want to explain something.
[00:18:34.136 --> 00:18:39.860]  What I'm doing is the bare minimum that a loyal, good American, but also just a good person would do.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.461]  This is not heroic.
[00:18:43.142 --> 00:18:44.763]  This is not amazing.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:19:03.747]  This is being informed about a corrupt global cabal that wants to cut our resources off, starve us to death, and kill us, testing the lockdowns for the real bio-attacks that are coming that'll make the synthetic spike protein bio-weapon look like mother's milk in comparison.
[00:19:05.608 --> 00:19:07.209]  Now, I'm already prepared to die.
[00:19:08.449 --> 00:19:10.290]  Not gonna commit suicide, love my life.
[00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:12.691]  What I'm saying is, I already know all this is real.
[00:19:13.652 --> 00:19:14.412]  I'm already prepared.
[00:19:15.513 --> 00:19:16.153]  I'm already ready.
[00:19:17.639 --> 00:19:18.580]  You're going to have to get ready.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.761]  And you're going to have to understand, they're coming for you.
[00:19:22.802 --> 00:19:23.602]  They're coming for you.
[00:19:24.483 --> 00:19:38.410]  And you're not going to get out of this without getting right with God, and getting informed, and informing others, and standing up and saying, we know who you are, we know you're the enemy, we know you lie, and you are going to go to prison.
[00:19:40.951 --> 00:19:46.054]  Tyrants know that we would organize against armies, and tanks, and planes, and missiles.
[00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:57.424]  But global corporate systems and the media attacking the people with inflation and open borders and poisoned food and nanotech and bioweapons and cultural poison.
[00:19:59.206 --> 00:20:04.151]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is how Satan attacks and that is the world you're living in.
[00:20:04.211 --> 00:20:06.093]  So you can pretend you're part of the system.
[00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:10.357]  You can pretend you're gonna shut up and not say anything and maybe you'll last a little longer.
[00:20:12.045 --> 00:20:35.852]  But in the aggregate, you are going to destroy yourself and your family and everything that's good and wish to God you've done something, not just because of what physically is going to happen to you, but because you are going to be so cut off from God and so desperate because you didn't do the right thing when you had a chance to not just save your ass, and not just save other people, but to get in line with God.
[00:20:36.132 --> 00:20:37.973]  Get aligned with the truth.
[00:20:39.938 --> 00:20:41.741]  Nobody's perfect and I'm not judging anybody.
[00:20:42.462 --> 00:20:44.224]  When I'm up here talking, I'm talking to myself.
[00:20:46.247 --> 00:20:54.038]  So a lot of folks have noticed I've been more focused and more on target and more serious than I've ever been because these are serious times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:56.934 --> 00:20:59.875]  Our government has been fully taken over by absolute criminals.
[00:21:00.516 --> 00:21:03.357]  There's a handful of people, the state and federal level, that are fighting.
[00:21:04.117 --> 00:21:15.382]  But the horror of what The Globalist is doing is so surreal and so scary that DeSantis and Senator Paul and many others like Trump and others, and even Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan.
[00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:16.503]  Joe Rogan knows all this.
[00:21:18.123 --> 00:21:25.347]  They don't think you're ready for the truth, and they don't think you can handle the truth, as they say, in a few good men.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.160]  You want the truth?
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.421]  You can't handle the truth!
[00:21:29.761 --> 00:21:30.401]  Well, guess what?
[00:21:30.901 --> 00:21:33.462]  I do believe you can handle the truth, and you're gonna get it here.
[00:21:34.922 --> 00:21:36.283]  So every day we're on air is precious.
[00:21:37.303 --> 00:21:38.884]  Every broadcast we put out is precious.
[00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:41.724]  And everything we do is in God's hands.
[00:21:41.764 --> 00:21:42.765]  But God works through you.
[00:21:42.805 --> 00:21:44.225]  That means I am in your hands.
[00:21:45.886 --> 00:21:47.006]  We are in each other's hands.
[00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:49.970]  And together, we can't be stopped.
[00:21:50.411 --> 00:21:51.572]  Without each other, we're done.
[00:21:51.632 --> 00:21:55.137]  So I want to salute the listeners that have been with us for decades and years.
[00:21:55.737 --> 00:22:00.223]  And salute the people that have stood with us and gotten the word out in the info war.
[00:22:00.544 --> 00:22:05.710]  And I want to encourage everybody to realize that you better spread the word like your life depends on it because it does.
[00:22:06.471 --> 00:22:15.945]  And you better pray for a global awakening, and you really should promote hardcore, the outlets that tell the truth, and there's nowhere like InfoWars, and I need your support.
[00:22:16.065 --> 00:22:17.066]  I don't like treading water.
[00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:19.069]  Please go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.491]  Right at the top, you can make a donation.
[00:22:21.468 --> 00:22:23.470]  One time, reoccurring, whatever you want.
[00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:25.052]  We've got great products you need.
[00:22:25.212 --> 00:22:27.794]  Everybody needs high-quality B12 that's not synthetic.
[00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:30.457]  Everybody needs real deep-earth crystalline iodine.
[00:22:30.597 --> 00:22:31.999]  We've got them together 40% off.
[00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:33.740]  And we've got great books and films.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:37.784]  We have the new Faraday bags that are the highest quality that the U.S.
[00:22:37.824 --> 00:22:42.869]  military uses that we have private labeled and produced 10,000 of.
[00:22:44.668 --> 00:22:46.029]  In what, 10 different sizes?
[00:22:46.649 --> 00:22:51.071]  From small phones up to large bags that'll hold desktop computers, you name it.
[00:22:51.471 --> 00:23:00.835]  This is so important in the future with the contact tracers and the globalists to get your mind around this and to start keeping these devices in these cages until you use them.
[00:23:01.195 --> 00:23:01.915]  100% effectiveness.
[00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:08.318]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:11.559]  These are high-end systems at very low prices.
[00:23:12.419 --> 00:23:18.422]   But whatever you do, Take the live links from Infowars.com forward slash show and battleplan.news.
[00:23:18.462 --> 00:23:21.644]  That's the clone site mirror of Bandai.
[00:23:21.664 --> 00:23:24.024]  Video takes you to the same links, but that's not being blocked now.
[00:23:24.064 --> 00:23:28.346]  I'm sure soon they'll block that with a new URL, but battleplan.news.
[00:23:28.426 --> 00:23:33.948]  And just continue to realize that facing the full horror of this is our best hope of stopping it.
[00:23:33.988 --> 00:23:51.003]   And we will stop it if people wake up to just how premeditated and predatory and Focus this attack is and how real and personal it is against you They're coming after me because they want to get to you and you know that we will cover the news We come back in the number out.
[00:23:51.463 --> 00:23:54.286]  We're gonna take calls in the second and third hour continually today.
[00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:58.290]  All right, my friends We are back live on this Friday transmission.
[00:23:58.371 --> 00:23:59.432]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:23:59.512 --> 00:24:06.721]   We're going to have open phones in the Second and third hour today.
[00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:09.863]  And again, I'm very thankful that you have joined us today.
[00:24:10.564 --> 00:24:29.100]  So, getting back to the ultra-massive level of lies that we've all been witnessing, and how that's scientifically being done, why that's scientifically being done, we need to consciously understand that, and understand what the enemy tactic is, and I'm going to explain that in a moment.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.421]  Because this is about discrediting the U.S.
[00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:32.861]  government.
[00:24:32.941 --> 00:24:34.462]  It's about discrediting America.
[00:24:34.902 --> 00:24:37.243]  It's about, while they rob us, bringing us down.
[00:24:37.283 --> 00:24:38.884]  This is a formula.
[00:24:40.225 --> 00:24:43.526]  So I'm not in defense of government corruption.
[00:24:43.606 --> 00:24:45.067]  I'm in defense of our Republic.
[00:24:45.407 --> 00:24:46.748]  And I am not anti-government.
[00:24:46.888 --> 00:24:49.909]  I am anti-globalist, occupied U.S.
[00:24:49.989 --> 00:24:50.350]  government.
[00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.912]  Let's play some of these outrageous lies of a press conference yesterday by Jen Psaki.
[00:24:57.073 --> 00:24:58.233]  Here is Jen Psaki.
[00:24:58.674 --> 00:25:14.665]   First off, Saying that the reason there's a baby formula shortage is because you're hoarding baby formula, even though the FDA admits they've shut down three of the largest plants, there's supply chain problems, and there's all sorts of staples that have been running low or absolutely out all over the U.S.
[00:25:14.705 --> 00:25:16.908]  and the world, and there's mass starvation in the third world.
[00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:22.550]  And that's all because of the lockdowns, not from COVID, but from the lockdowns they put in place that were designed to do this.
[00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.191]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, and you'll like it because you're going to be dead.
[00:25:26.511 --> 00:25:28.792]  And you'll have no free will, and you'll have no privacy.
[00:25:28.832 --> 00:25:30.832]  Those are all official statements by the Davos Group.
[00:25:31.812 --> 00:25:32.313]  I can play the clips.
[00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.473]  I've already played them probably a hundred times.
[00:25:34.593 --> 00:25:38.274]  You're like, again, why do they lie on one hand, then rub our noses in it in the other?
[00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:39.854]  I'll explain the psychology in a moment.
[00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:43.795]  You can give it technical terms, but I'm going to give you the Alex Jones street view.
[00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:46.796]  Now, here's Saki.
[00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:56.264]  But if you are a parent who's looking for formula right now, struggling to find what you need, do you have even a rough guess of how long these shortages are going to last?
[00:25:56.344 --> 00:25:58.205]  What should parents be bracing for here?
[00:25:58.405 --> 00:26:01.346]  Well, we've already seen an increase in supply over the past couple of weeks.
[00:26:01.506 --> 00:26:04.047]  What we are seeing, which is an enormous problem, is hoarding.
[00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:06.348]  People hoarding because they're fearful.
[00:26:07.008 --> 00:26:08.449]  That is one element of it.
[00:26:08.489 --> 00:26:11.990]  And people hoarding because they are trying to profit off of fearful parents.
[00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:14.131]  So that is also something we're focused on.
[00:26:16.753 --> 00:26:19.175]  So, you're hoarding baby formula.
[00:26:19.195 --> 00:26:20.616]  No, this is not like the toilet paper.
[00:26:20.676 --> 00:26:21.557]  There's shortages.
[00:26:23.298 --> 00:26:26.381]  And by the way, the ants save stuff in the summer and live through the winter.
[00:26:26.401 --> 00:26:27.222]  The grasshoppers don't.
[00:26:27.782 --> 00:26:31.565]  All of our ancestors up until 50 years ago did have a year's supply of food.
[00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:33.327]  That's what you're supposed to do unless you're an idiot.
[00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.249]  But they train you to have nothing so they can control you.
[00:26:36.809 --> 00:26:37.430]  Now it gets worse.
[00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.552]  Here she is expanding on the gaslighting.
[00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:45.877]  Here's Saki saying that if parents can't buy baby formula, call a doctor.
[00:26:47.603 --> 00:26:52.148]  As if a doctor is going to then have all this baby formula for you.
[00:26:53.590 --> 00:27:06.484]  I mean, just the let the meat cake nature of this is just, again, so in your face insult.
[00:27:06.944 --> 00:27:07.365]  Here she is.
[00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:09.959]  You said it was a public health question.
[00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:12.157]  Which agency should that question be directed to?
[00:27:12.157 --> 00:27:16.077]   Just the very practical, immediate question of if you can't find formula
[00:27:16.077 --> 00:27:19.677]   and you need it for your baby to eat, what should they be doing?
[00:27:19.677 --> 00:27:25.038]   We would certainly encourage any parent who has concerns about their child's health or well-being
[00:27:25.038 --> 00:27:27.197]  to call their doctor or pediatrician.
[00:27:27.197 --> 00:27:33.357]  Now, she just said that you should just go to your doctor.
[00:27:33.357 --> 00:27:36.318]   She just said they're hoarding it, there's not really a supply problem.
[00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:42.457]  But then she admits that there's been a problem, that's clip 7, and says they've been working on it for months.
[00:27:42.537 --> 00:27:48.279]  So, the problem doesn't exist, but it's your fault because you're hoarding, but they've been working on the problem for months.
[00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:48.739]  Here she is.
[00:27:49.394 --> 00:28:00.363]  President Biden has directed the administration to work urgently to ensure that infant formula is safe and available for families across the country during the Abbott Nutrition Voluntary Recall.
[00:28:00.743 --> 00:28:03.386]  This is work that's been underway for months.
[00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.909]  Okay, so just 12 months ago there is no inflation.
[00:28:07.449 --> 00:28:09.511]  Then inflation's light and it's good for you.
[00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:11.893]  And now, okay, there's inflation, it's your fault.
[00:28:12.894 --> 00:28:13.894]  It's the Republicans' fault.
[00:28:14.335 --> 00:28:16.557]  And the fuel's up because he shut down all the pipelines.
[00:28:18.704 --> 00:28:20.767]  And killed basically all of the permits.
[00:28:21.448 --> 00:28:22.450]  But that's okay.
[00:28:23.692 --> 00:28:24.974]  Because we're in a transition.
[00:28:25.635 --> 00:28:26.937]  But there's no fuel shortage.
[00:28:27.658 --> 00:28:28.499]  But it's good for you.
[00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:30.262]  You need to learn to not drive too much.
[00:28:31.083 --> 00:28:31.244]  See?
[00:28:32.981 --> 00:28:43.706]  They write up all these lies and all these answers and then don't even care if they don't match up logically because they're training you on a diet of garbage to make you lose confidence.
[00:28:44.026 --> 00:28:46.447]  That's what lockdowns were about so you wouldn't work anymore.
[00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:47.987]  That's what all the fear is about.
[00:28:48.248 --> 00:28:51.129]  It's what all the third world populations that are desperately brought in is about.
[00:28:52.543 --> 00:28:53.144]  Collapse.
[00:28:53.284 --> 00:28:58.929]  Cloward and Piven, the Democratic Party plan, developed by communist professors, to undermine the U.S.
[00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:03.713]  and to cut off resources and to collapse it, to then bring in their new system.
[00:29:04.113 --> 00:29:11.300]  And under that same plan, 50 million Americans, that was back when there were 200 million Americans, now it would be like 100 million, they want to put in camps.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:14.042]  And they estimate they'll have to kill half of us in those camps.
[00:29:14.322 --> 00:29:19.447]  That came out in federal trials with the weathermen that directly advised Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:23.543]  That comes out of Columbia University.
[00:29:23.703 --> 00:29:26.785]  I'm not gonna go play the clips or the witnesses or all of you can find it if you want.
[00:29:26.985 --> 00:29:27.365]  You know what?
[00:29:27.405 --> 00:29:33.169]  Get Harry Grothjohn, the Green Beret that they tried to hire that infiltrated him and got all the recordings.
[00:29:34.349 --> 00:29:38.772]  I'll get that clip of Grothjohn talking about the plan to kill 25 million people in death camps.
[00:29:39.613 --> 00:29:41.474]  And they got the documents too.
[00:29:42.494 --> 00:29:44.516]  So that's the type of people that we're dealing with.
[00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:45.816]  Here is Shaki.
[00:29:48.427 --> 00:29:50.328]  With more gaslighting.
[00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.350]  More intense spying.
[00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.172]  Here she is saying that it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:29:55.652 --> 00:30:05.519]  There are no crackpipes being mailed out by the federal government, even though we have the bill, the legislation that passed last year, the ten million dollars for it, and all that I'm about to show you.
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.461]  But see, we show you this stuff.
[00:30:07.521 --> 00:30:11.483]  She just says it's a lie, even though they defended it six months ago.
[00:30:11.523 --> 00:30:11.904]  Here she is.
[00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:18.547]  This policy does not allow for crack pipes to be included.
[00:30:18.707 --> 00:30:22.417]  I would just note that this is a bit of a conspiracy theory that's been spread out there.
[00:30:22.477 --> 00:30:23.339]  It's not accurate.
[00:30:24.764 --> 00:30:26.605]  It's a bit of a conspiracy.
[00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:28.026]  How much of a bit is it?
[00:30:28.506 --> 00:30:29.767]  Okay, overhead shot, please.
[00:30:30.388 --> 00:30:32.829]  Here's just our little free government crack pipe file.
[00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:36.471]  Took us about five minutes to pull all this up, and all these articles have links to it.
[00:30:36.952 --> 00:30:41.094]  Free crack pipes obtained in an investigation of government-funded safe smoking kits.
[00:30:41.194 --> 00:30:42.295]  Congress has obtained them.
[00:30:42.535 --> 00:30:43.816]  You can go to health departments and get them.
[00:30:44.096 --> 00:30:48.159]  It says the federal government paid for them, and we've got them all over the country.
[00:30:48.579 --> 00:30:51.363]  From Virginia, New York, you name it, that's where they're getting them.
[00:30:51.904 --> 00:30:57.231]  Revealed, Biden administration's safe smoking kits include crack pipes, other drug paraphernalia.
[00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:01.966]  Free Beacon-confirmed safe smoking kits include free crack pipes.
[00:31:02.326 --> 00:31:07.808]  So, by them denying it, we have a debate about whether or not it's happening, instead of telling them to stop.
[00:31:08.448 --> 00:31:14.370]  And that's the tactic when you've got a piece of legislation that passed, with the funding, and the millions of crack pipes being mailed out.
[00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:14.811]  It's millions.
[00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:21.193]  And then, when people complain about it, you just say it doesn't exist, so you then have a debate about whether it exists or not.
[00:31:21.693 --> 00:31:24.715]  Like, hey, I don't want the Davos Group to run my health care through the UN.
[00:31:24.935 --> 00:31:26.136]  They signed an agreement last week.
[00:31:26.156 --> 00:31:27.056]  They've got a secret treaty.
[00:31:27.316 --> 00:31:33.560]  They admit takes full control of all the health departments and all the federal government responses in 196 countries.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.721]  Their response is, doesn't exist.
[00:31:37.783 --> 00:31:38.343]  Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:38.363 --> 00:31:39.644]  We don't want the Bilderberg Group running things.
[00:31:40.004 --> 00:31:40.604]  Doesn't exist.
[00:31:42.926 --> 00:31:44.727]  And then you just have a debate about whether it exists or not.
[00:31:46.368 --> 00:31:49.990]  And then I can show you some of the legislation right here.
[00:31:52.079 --> 00:32:02.992]  This is the Fiscal Year 2022 Harm Reduction Program, funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, with money from the second COVID bailout last year.
[00:32:03.753 --> 00:32:11.002]  Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Harm Reduction Program, and then here it is right here, page 8.
[00:32:12.083 --> 00:32:15.808]  With the crack pipes, and then it lists the legislation that funded it.
[00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:24.819]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, it does not exist because Psaki just said so.
[00:32:26.421 --> 00:32:27.161]  See how that works?
[00:32:28.863 --> 00:32:29.644]  See how that works?
[00:32:29.704 --> 00:32:34.307]  And meanwhile, drug overdoses are going straight up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:34.967 --> 00:32:36.668]  Drug overdoses are going straight up.
[00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.329]  There's the graph for you, right there.
[00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:43.072]  Alright, we got some big news on a lot of big issues.
[00:32:43.633 --> 00:32:46.995]  On censorship, on the Russia war, and so much more.
[00:32:47.075 --> 00:32:47.956]  Coming up, stay with us.
[00:32:49.016 --> 00:32:50.557]  Alright, it's not bragging.
[00:32:51.258 --> 00:32:52.499]  Believe me, we're a major target.
[00:32:52.959 --> 00:32:53.559]  The target.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.302]  But it's true, we are the main resistance.
[00:32:59.076 --> 00:33:00.077]  We have the enemy plan.
[00:33:00.597 --> 00:33:01.879]  We know their operations.
[00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:02.719]  We know how to stop them.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:08.525]  And we're here swinging for the fences and praying to God to direct us and give us victory.
[00:33:11.568 --> 00:33:17.594]  The answer to the New World Order is everybody becoming awake.
[00:33:18.715 --> 00:33:20.917]  And I guess you could say we're all Alex Jones.
[00:33:20.937 --> 00:33:21.738]  We're all Spartacus.
[00:33:22.919 --> 00:33:37.711]   And The good news is, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, there are Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan types, many of which believed in the system previously, but now know it's predatory and coming after everybody.
[00:33:38.571 --> 00:33:44.294]  And they are now telling their giant audiences that we're dealing with creepy, evil dictators that are our enemies.
[00:33:44.374 --> 00:33:45.454]  And it's just a fact.
[00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:53.698]  And if we can't address this plan, this Bilderberg Group, Davos plan, Davos is the Bilderberg Group, it's public arm, then we have no future.
[00:33:54.636 --> 00:34:00.079]  And I can cover, again, I've already covered some news, but I can cover news all day, and I am going to cover the latest in Ukraine in a moment, the economy.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:06.824]  But it's this understanding that's everything, that you're not at a football game where it doesn't matter who wins.
[00:34:07.444 --> 00:34:18.311]  This is life and death, and these people see you as the enemy because you're eating food and taking resources that they believe is theirs because they took the planet over through fractional reserve banking and derivatives and fraud.
[00:34:19.386 --> 00:34:34.222]  And instead of going to prison, they plan to crash the whole system, take everything over, vertically integrate things, and make you as poor as possible to then, with a social credit score and universal basic income, after they've made us obsolete, shine on to slow death.
[00:34:36.064 --> 00:34:47.375]   So, this is happening, and there's nothing more positive When you got a broken leg and a compound fracture and your bone's sticking out the side of your leg, to admit you got a broken leg and to go get the damn thing fixed.
[00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:50.618]  But we're sitting here with bullet holes in us.
[00:34:51.419 --> 00:34:52.100]  Bleeding to death.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:35:02.609]  And if we can't admit that we got shot, and if we can't admit that we're in trouble, and if we can't admit the people that did it are getting ready to chop our head off and finish the job, well then we're done!
[00:35:03.663 --> 00:35:05.465]  You gotta get out of your comfort zone.
[00:35:05.705 --> 00:35:07.426]  You gotta get into survival mode.
[00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:09.148]  You gotta get into resistance mode.
[00:35:09.348 --> 00:35:10.929]  You gotta get into the life force.
[00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:15.554]  You gotta get into the will to survive and thrive and have victory.
[00:35:20.138 --> 00:35:21.158]  We need to join wills.
[00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.862]  Before God together right now.
[00:35:25.602 --> 00:35:26.023]  Pray with me.
[00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:37.438]  Our Heavenly Father, we come before you meekly and repent for all of our sins and know that our best works are but dirty rags before you in your complete, absolute perfection.
[00:35:38.239 --> 00:35:56.183]  We thank you for the gift of consciousness and free will and we ask you to enter our souls and to cleanse us of the evil and to set us upright and help us be engines and vessels of truth and justice to stand against the wickedness that is coming against our children and our very genetic code and the future of our species.
[00:35:57.284 --> 00:36:02.708]  We humbly ask you to intersect now via free will and to come into our hearts and souls together.
[00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:16.177]  And as a community, make us strong and give us the vision and to lead God and direct us to the important work we must do and to give us the courage and the commitment and the focus to carry out this task.
[00:36:17.057 --> 00:36:23.081]  In the name of your great sacrifice of your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:36:23.502 --> 00:36:23.742]  Amen.
[00:36:26.897 --> 00:36:29.218]  I'm asking all of you to join wills with me now.
[00:36:30.919 --> 00:36:31.900]  Your will is strong.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.900]  Your will is old.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.861]  Your lineage is powerful.
[00:36:36.042 --> 00:36:38.283]  They fear you and they fear what we're going to do together.
[00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:41.725]  We are only in our larval stage right now.
[00:36:41.765 --> 00:36:47.388]  We are only like the caterpillar that is now going into the chrysalis to become the butterfly.
[00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:49.970]  The journey has just begun.
[00:36:52.534 --> 00:36:55.535]  But we must recognize it and we must come together.
[00:36:56.535 --> 00:36:57.636]  We must join forces.
[00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:00.077]  We must do it before God.
[00:37:01.017 --> 00:37:06.859]  We must commit and sign on to the resistance of Satan and obedience to God.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.581]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:37:13.122 --> 00:37:14.342]  So said Thomas Jefferson.
[00:37:15.282 --> 00:37:19.104]  Jefferson also said, I have sworn on the altar of God.
[00:37:20.282 --> 00:37:26.885]  Eternal resistance over every form of tyranny that attacks the mind of man.
[00:37:29.486 --> 00:37:41.412]  It was Mark Twain, the great intellectual, that said, In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[00:37:42.753 --> 00:37:44.754]  But in time his cause succeeds.
[00:37:49.215 --> 00:37:57.741]  The timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:38:00.083 --> 00:38:04.205]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated, feared, and scorned.
[00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:16.594]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:38:18.769 --> 00:38:29.637]  You are the people listening of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love God that are the tip of that spear, that are that fire of resistance, that are the will of God manifest on this planet.
[00:38:31.038 --> 00:38:36.262]  And you must recognize who you are and your strength and know that you do this for the children.
[00:38:37.403 --> 00:38:41.146]  And you must set your will in motion before God.
[00:38:41.166 --> 00:38:51.027]   And that is the great quest That's the whole point of existence on this planet.
[00:38:53.489 --> 00:38:59.354]  And I want all of us to join together in eternity with God and break the will of Satan.
[00:39:00.855 --> 00:39:07.855]  in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:39:07.855 --> 00:39:12.855]   I'm going to give the toll-free number out in a moment for first-time callers again today.
[00:39:13.524 --> 00:39:25.890]   And after we put 20 calls on the board, We'll open it up to all the callers, but I want to give people that have never been able to get through, that have tried so many times, a chance to join us here to discuss any topic, any issue.
[00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.651]  Nothing's off-limits.
[00:39:27.031 --> 00:39:27.732]  Nothing's censored.
[00:39:28.593 --> 00:39:29.693]  It's not really a pet peeve.
[00:39:29.754 --> 00:39:32.736]  It's just been asked of me thousands of times, and it's always the same answer.
[00:39:33.597 --> 00:39:35.218]  When you call in, we don't screen your call.
[00:39:35.238 --> 00:39:38.601]  If you want to tell us what you're calling about, or where you're calling from, or what the topic is, that's fine.
[00:39:39.822 --> 00:39:41.983]  But you can say no topic at all.
[00:39:42.003 --> 00:39:42.664]  We're going to put you on air.
[00:39:43.772 --> 00:39:48.056]  Just have a clean phone line and then don't ask me on air, can I get into this?
[00:39:48.097 --> 00:39:48.857]  Can I get into that?
[00:39:49.838 --> 00:39:54.583]  You are welcome here and the door is open and the table is round.
[00:39:55.784 --> 00:39:59.128]  Meaning we're all listening to each other and no one's at the head of the table.
[00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:05.675]  And I respect you and I want to hear your ideas and I appreciate you brothers and sisters.
[00:40:08.151 --> 00:40:09.432]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:40:09.452 --> 00:40:09.572]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:40:09.592 --> 00:40:09.632]  877-789-2539.
[00:40:09.452 --> 00:40:14.452]  is 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[00:40:14.452 --> 00:40:21.772]   Before I get back in the news, I just wanna take a few minutes out here
[00:40:21.772 --> 00:40:26.471]   to recognize and appreciate the great crew and the wonderful work they do,
[00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:30.692]   and to thank all the great listeners and activists and our sponsors and our radio affiliates
[00:40:30.692 --> 00:40:35.252]   and TV affiliates from WWCR right down the line and all the great work they do,
[00:40:35.252 --> 00:40:39.171]   because when I get the credit for this broadcast, I do not deserve it.
[00:40:39.256 --> 00:40:40.137]  God comes first.
[00:40:40.517 --> 00:40:41.237]  You come second.
[00:40:41.618 --> 00:40:44.960]  I'm just a focal point because I have trouble bending over.
[00:40:46.053 --> 00:40:47.633]  I have trouble watching scams.
[00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:50.554]  I have trouble watching liars get away with things.
[00:40:50.834 --> 00:40:53.115]  I get angry at pedophiles.
[00:40:53.375 --> 00:41:12.546]   I have a drive to resist these people because I know who they are and I know they must be stopped because I know deep down the fire I've got in my heart and my belly and my will that's driving me to defeat these people Is because that's what God demands.
[00:41:12.746 --> 00:41:15.348]  It is not something you elect to do.
[00:41:15.728 --> 00:41:23.213]  You will do it or you will be cut off for eternity from God and be put with these people.
[00:41:23.734 --> 00:41:26.055]  And you do not want to be with the left hand path.
[00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:35.041]  You do not want to be with Alistair Crowley and Madame Blavatsky and the whole New World Order and their whole system of where they've gone.
[00:41:38.223 --> 00:41:45.577]   You want to be With the progenitor of life, the creator of free will, the true architect of the entire system.
[00:41:46.138 --> 00:41:48.539]  It's said that Satan's called the great architect.
[00:41:48.999 --> 00:41:50.900]  People go, oh, you called the great architect, come on, Satan.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.120]  No.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.481]  Satan is a counterfeit.
[00:41:54.661 --> 00:41:57.703]  And everything Satan claims he gives you is a lie.
[00:41:58.123 --> 00:42:00.964]  Satan claims, oh, great sex, wild parties.
[00:42:01.704 --> 00:42:02.665]  God gave us sex.
[00:42:03.965 --> 00:42:04.846]  God gave us wealth.
[00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:07.347]  God gave us everything we have.
[00:42:08.328 --> 00:42:16.033]  And we have to recognize that and make that interdimensional, intergalactic, interstellar connection to that.
[00:42:16.513 --> 00:42:19.215]  And it's there and it's waiting for the channel to be open.
[00:42:19.515 --> 00:42:21.317]  But you must open the channel.
[00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:24.799]  Open the channel with us today.
[00:42:24.819 --> 00:42:24.859]  877-789-2539.
[00:42:25.199 --> 00:42:26.160]  We're going to go on a break.
[00:42:30.336 --> 00:42:30.996]  We're going to come back.
[00:42:31.697 --> 00:42:37.399]  We're going to cover a ton of news on Russia, the economy, censorship, Elon Musk, and so much more.
[00:42:37.419 --> 00:42:38.439]  A bunch of key clips.
[00:42:38.799 --> 00:42:42.761]  Joe Rogan going after Trudeau up in Canada.
[00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:47.282]  And so much more today on the InfoWars.
[00:42:47.983 --> 00:42:50.924]  InfoWars.com, where the resistance lives.
[00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:53.525]  InfoWars.com, the tip of the spear.
[00:42:54.747 --> 00:42:57.830]  Infowars.com, the shield and sword of the people.
[00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.471]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:42:59.891 --> 00:43:01.012]  You made the InfoWar.

[00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:44.219]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[00:43:44.459 --> 00:43:51.522]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:56.645]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply and it's been sold out for a month because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:43:57.166 --> 00:44:01.549]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week.
[00:44:01.569 --> 00:44:02.550]  Then it goes back to full price.
[00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:05.051]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[00:44:05.592 --> 00:44:09.235]  Experience X2 for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:44:11.716 --> 00:44:12.397]  Take action now.
[00:44:13.174 --> 00:44:14.315]  Now into hour number two.
[00:44:14.355 --> 00:44:16.536]  The phone lines are loading up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:16.556 --> 00:44:20.818]  We'll talk more about how Biden must be impeached and so much more in the next segment.
[00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:40.626]   I want to play a few clips here with Congressman Carmack and Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about food security is national security and where the baby formula is being sent, of course, and just how sick all of this is as they try to overtake the carrying capacity of the Western world and collapse it.
[00:44:40.686 --> 00:44:42.668]  This is true siege.
[00:44:42.688 --> 00:44:44.269]  21st century warfare.
[00:44:46.049 --> 00:44:56.775]  I mean, carry it out against you and your family, and we have got to get the pastors and the talk show hosts and the legislators and the governors just saying, no, we are not going to be part of this.
[00:44:56.875 --> 00:45:01.937]  We realize the global corporations are squeezing small companies, individuals and families to destroy us.
[00:45:02.538 --> 00:45:02.798]  All right.
[00:45:02.818 --> 00:45:05.419]  Here are these two important statements back to back.
[00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:06.640]  We'll go to break and come back with your calls.
[00:45:07.495 --> 00:45:15.740]  Right now we have a food security crisis for the most vulnerable of Americans, the ones that we cherish the most, and that's our babies.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:24.945]  Moms and dads all over the country, some of them are traveling hours every single day looking for baby formula as they can't find it in their local grocery store.
[00:45:25.386 --> 00:45:32.470]  They're reaching out to friends and families and making new friends in Facebook groups and online as they're searching to find baby formula.
[00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:44.058]  Even mothers that have been giving their babies baby formula are now searching out breastfeeding mothers looking to buy an extra supply of milk if they're willing to share it or sell it.
[00:45:44.458 --> 00:45:53.264]  This is a crisis that should never be happening and this is completely squarely on the shoulders of the Biden administration and the Democrats that are controlling our government.
[00:45:54.105 --> 00:45:56.326]  You see, this didn't start just last month.
[00:45:56.926 --> 00:46:00.208]  It was July of last year when baby formula shortages started.
[00:46:00.688 --> 00:46:07.051]  And that happened because of COVID lockdowns and the complete crisis and shutdown in our supply chains.
[00:46:07.692 --> 00:46:11.934]  Now with rising inflation and fuel prices, this is going to continue.
[00:46:12.314 --> 00:46:14.335]  This is not going to remedy itself quickly.
[00:46:15.095 --> 00:46:19.957]  We also have over-regulation through the FDA, and this has been going on for years.
[00:46:20.397 --> 00:46:26.159]  Label requirements, shipping requirements, and very strict rules when it comes to baby formula.
[00:46:26.459 --> 00:46:30.341]  So it's not just getting a supply here at home, it's difficult to get it from overseas.
[00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:45.408]  When you have mothers crying in grocery stores because they can't find food to feed their babies, that is a critical sign that we're in a country in despair, we're a country in crisis, and we have to do everything we can to change it.
[00:46:46.108 --> 00:46:46.968]  Here's what we know.
[00:46:47.469 --> 00:46:52.031]  This government is failing the American people, the taxpayers and its citizens.
[00:46:52.811 --> 00:47:09.019]  Pictures are emerging today from the border where the Biden administration has been sending pallets of baby formula for illegal mothers and their babies, while American mothers and babies cannot find baby formula.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.622]  This is completely unacceptable, and this needs to end now.
[00:47:14.102 --> 00:47:21.426]  I have one thing to say, and this is something that it's hard to even imagine, but we cannot trust our government.
[00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:28.112]  If you're an expecting mother, I urge you, strongly urge you to do the best you can to try to breastfeed your baby.
[00:47:28.672 --> 00:47:39.862]  Because you cannot depend on this government that is supposedly running our country to create the right conditions in our economy for you to be able to find baby formula.
[00:47:40.223 --> 00:47:41.944]  And this should never, ever happen.
[00:47:42.445 --> 00:47:48.170]  I thank Congresswoman Stefanik, I thank my colleagues that were all joining together to work on this.
[00:47:48.910 --> 00:48:00.362]  Absolutely have to share with you right now is the craziness of the Empty Shelves Biden movement and the fact that they are sending pallets, pallets of baby formula to the border.
[00:48:00.782 --> 00:48:05.867]  Meanwhile, in our own district at home, we cannot find baby formula.
[00:48:06.127 --> 00:48:07.569]  This is a picture from a Target.
[00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:09.891]  Oh, it's upside down.
[00:48:09.931 --> 00:48:10.111]  Sorry.
[00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:16.900]  Okay, we literally are struggling to find baby formula around the country.
[00:48:17.301 --> 00:48:20.222]  Moms are struggling going from store to store to store.
[00:48:20.602 --> 00:48:25.584]  And then the stores are actually capping the amount of baby formula that they will sell them.
[00:48:26.065 --> 00:48:32.468]  But, and this got sent to me by a Border Patrol agent this morning and said, this is disgusting.
[00:48:33.208 --> 00:48:34.228]  You will not believe this.
[00:48:34.789 --> 00:48:42.134]   They're receiving pallets and more pallets of baby formula At the border.
[00:48:42.374 --> 00:48:53.247]  This was taken at Ursula processing facility where thousands are being housed and processed and then released subsequently into the United States.
[00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:55.109]  So think about this.
[00:48:55.689 --> 00:48:57.351]  This is what America last looks like.
[00:48:57.912 --> 00:48:58.653]  This is 100% what it looks like.
[00:49:00.851 --> 00:49:09.334]  We are going to punch through the New World Order lies, we are going to reach our fellow humans across the globe, and we are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:49:10.194 --> 00:49:13.255]  It has been foretold, and we can already smell the victory.
[00:49:13.916 --> 00:49:18.217]  It's Friday the 13th on this May 13th broadcast.
[00:49:19.037 --> 00:49:23.479]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we are the Human Resistance.
[00:49:23.959 --> 00:49:26.420]  And I can feel your strength.
[00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:29.400]  I can feel your will.
[00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.562]  I can feel your power.
[00:49:32.582 --> 00:49:42.930]  We're taking your phone calls the next two hours, starting at the next segment.
[00:49:43.971 --> 00:49:56.680]  But I'm going to hit a lot of news right now, here on the World Wide Broadcast, that exists in defiance to tyranny and defense of liberty, and that outrages the enemies of our people to no end.
[00:50:00.342 --> 00:50:01.162]  We are strong.
[00:50:02.143 --> 00:50:06.905]  The devil is broken, and that's why he comes to try to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:50:06.925 --> 00:50:11.767]  All right, I want to hit the situation in Ukraine.
[00:50:11.787 --> 00:50:15.049]  There's some really huge developments there, but I really like what Joe Rogan's been doing lately.
[00:50:15.569 --> 00:50:20.771]  He's been hitting on all cylinders and saying basically every podcast nice things about the broadcast.
[00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:21.632]  We appreciate that, Joe.
[00:50:23.041 --> 00:50:25.662]  And he's really awake, fully awake now.
[00:50:25.982 --> 00:50:30.745]  It's hard for him to believe how evil the system is, but he gets it now, now that he's shifted his perspective and now it all makes sense.
[00:50:32.165 --> 00:50:39.269]  He's coming out and talking about how the dictator up in Canada, he stole the election, declared martial law, how he's a creepy son of a bitch.
[00:50:40.169 --> 00:50:44.031]  And this is the spirit we need, realizing these are our enemies.
[00:50:44.612 --> 00:50:50.535]  And not even at a debate level with them, we know they're agents of the Davos Group that's penetrated our governments and taken over.
[00:50:50.875 --> 00:50:51.896]  And who created the Davos Group?
[00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:52.857]  The Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:53.797]  And what's their goal?
[00:50:53.857 --> 00:50:55.038]  World government depopulation.
[00:50:55.078 --> 00:50:55.618]  It's on record.
[00:50:56.399 --> 00:50:56.739]  Here it is.
[00:51:00.222 --> 00:51:32.241]   Great of taxation but I always knew that Canada was really high and you know it used to be the Canada was high but crime was lower the United States people were friendlier it seems like a great system because you have socialized medicine you have you know some sort of a health care system up there although there's a lot of complaints about that as well your education system is it seems like it's more accessible to people to go to college and things like that so you're contributing into this pile which is fine but then when you have what's A creepy fucking dictator for a Prime Minister.
[00:51:32.261 --> 00:51:33.601]  And that's what he is.
[00:51:33.741 --> 00:51:34.041]  He is.
[00:51:34.081 --> 00:51:42.984]  The way he behaves, the way he behaved during this thing and just the disingenuous way that he communicated, it freaked me out because I never thought that guy was like that.
[00:51:43.544 --> 00:51:47.705]  We had a conversation a few years ago where you were sort of more positive about him.
[00:51:47.725 --> 00:51:56.567]  I thought he was a handsome fellow with a good vocabulary and seems like a nice guy and you know before he really leaned into the woke stuff I just thought he was a kind, sensitive guy.
[00:51:57.028 --> 00:52:01.367]   And I was like, that's probably a good you know disposition to be a leader
[00:52:01.367 --> 00:52:07.407]   but just the way he labeled those truckers as racist
[00:52:07.407 --> 00:52:11.007]   for no reason the people who were protesting against mandates
[00:52:11.007 --> 00:52:14.606]  he decided they were misogynists and racist. - Chastphobic.
[00:52:14.606 --> 00:52:15.527]  Yeah.
[00:52:15.527 --> 00:52:22.498]   It was just but the way he did it was just like he just cast a pejorative label on them with no evidence
[00:52:22.498 --> 00:52:24.847]   with no provocation
[00:52:24.968 --> 00:52:37.721]  It was just like, I'm going to label them this so that I can impose laws to stop them from doing what is essentially a peaceful protest against something that... So let me tell you about the draconian measures we've had in Quebec.
[00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:39.582]  Oh, I know.
[00:52:39.762 --> 00:52:40.323]  You know about it?
[00:52:40.343 --> 00:52:41.103]  Yeah, I have friends.
[00:52:41.543 --> 00:52:43.825]  I have friends that live in Quebec and they're furious.
[00:52:43.905 --> 00:52:45.866]  So we still have, by the way, masks.
[00:52:46.247 --> 00:52:49.249]  I think they're removing them on May 14th, right?
[00:52:49.289 --> 00:52:54.492]  So the first time... We gotta get Gad Sad back on, he's a really smart guy.
[00:52:55.693 --> 00:53:03.399]  So, pulling back from this, it's, it's, it's...
[00:53:04.867 --> 00:53:10.310]  Critical to understand that the whole liberal fake effeminate act of people like Trudeau is an act.
[00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.912]  These are psychotic control freaks.
[00:53:13.812 --> 00:53:20.156]  And they're trained in NLP and all other forms of different psychological warfare.
[00:53:20.216 --> 00:53:21.276]  They're sent to special schools.
[00:53:21.336 --> 00:53:21.877]  It's on record.
[00:53:22.813 --> 00:53:29.539]  They're sent to demo schools to do all this, to make themselves sound as non-threatening as possible.
[00:53:29.619 --> 00:53:30.840]  I call it the NPR voice.
[00:53:31.181 --> 00:53:40.609]  Very soft, very nice, very... To lull you into a sense of security when these people are literally trying to kill you.
[00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:46.435]  Canada now is euthanizing old people without their permission, which we always warned it would lead to.
[00:53:47.984 --> 00:53:56.368]  Think of the most selfish, horrible, wicked stuff you can imagine, and then go further, and that's who these people are.
[00:53:56.428 --> 00:54:00.430]  Whatever you can imagine, and it's all on record, they're doing it.
[00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:17.884]   Because once you become evil and you have no morals, then the very worst Remove those that are just corrupt and want power, and puts in people that have sick, twisted, satanic fetishes to hurt innocent people.
[00:54:19.345 --> 00:54:23.608]  So that's why what Joe is talking about there is so important.
[00:54:23.648 --> 00:54:32.015]  And notice, Joe's a master of going, oh, free healthcare, it sounded so good, so liberal, so loving, to get liberals to listen.
[00:54:33.274 --> 00:54:46.060]  And that's why he's so effective, is he's there, oh I'm with you, but oh this is really bad, and he actually convinces people, whereas I do the frontal assault, and he's not right, I'm not right, he's not wrong, I'm not wrong.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:51.522]  Different approaches are gonna reach different people.
[00:54:52.942 --> 00:55:00.766]  But that's why they fear Joe, is that he's very smooth about it, and he talks to them in their NPR voice.
[00:55:01.857 --> 00:55:04.700]  And he deprograms them, and he's doing a great job.
[00:55:06.001 --> 00:55:08.443]  And some of the listeners are like, well Joe's not perfect, this and that.
[00:55:09.163 --> 00:55:13.167]  Believe me, Joe is completely on board.
[00:55:15.169 --> 00:55:20.974]  And the system knows that, but he has decided another path to beat them, and I say more power to him.
[00:55:21.054 --> 00:55:24.237]  Now, let's hit some of this military news.
[00:55:27.259 --> 00:55:35.185]   If you look at maps, I should have told the crew, of NATO 1993, type in maps of NATO 1993, NATO 2022.
[00:55:35.185 --> 00:55:43.985]   And you'll see NATO's doubled in size and is all around Russia and is then fomenting movements
[00:55:43.985 --> 00:55:49.945]   to overthrow the Russian government inside their country, which is an act of war, admitting we're in a proxy war
[00:55:49.945 --> 00:55:55.564]   with Russia, tens of billions of dollars of weapons already shipped in and now 40 billion.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.984]  Rand Paul's blocking it right now, but 40 billion passed in the House in two hours.
[00:56:00.044 --> 00:56:01.245]  No one had a chance to read the bill.
[00:56:01.566 --> 00:56:02.407]  Now we're learning about it.
[00:56:02.507 --> 00:56:05.089]  It is just insane for domestic propaganda here.
[00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:07.212]  All sorts of illegal CIA operations.
[00:56:07.292 --> 00:56:09.654]  I mean, it is coup funding money.
[00:56:11.256 --> 00:56:17.496]   So if you look at NATO, In the baby blue of your TV viewer, it's in only a few countries in 1949, 1982.
[00:56:18.357 --> 00:56:22.761]  The 1990, it expands into Poland and a bunch of other countries.
[00:56:23.362 --> 00:56:25.203]  1999 expands.
[00:56:25.424 --> 00:56:25.884]  2009 expands.
[00:56:26.485 --> 00:56:30.609]  And then now if you look where it's expanded today, it's even larger.
[00:56:31.736 --> 00:56:32.457]  And the best maps.
[00:56:32.497 --> 00:56:33.898]  Great job finding that map.
[00:56:34.639 --> 00:56:35.580]  Yeah, that's a better one.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.301]  It just shows the switch.
[00:56:38.743 --> 00:56:40.024]  1990 to 2015, there's a map.
[00:56:40.164 --> 00:56:41.946]  And as you see, that's doubled in size.
[00:56:42.446 --> 00:56:43.347]  And now it's even more.
[00:56:44.007 --> 00:56:45.189]  And now they're trying to take Ukraine.
[00:56:47.251 --> 00:56:48.692]  Which is as Russian as it gets.
[00:56:48.752 --> 00:56:52.095]  I mean, Ukraine is Russia's mama.
[00:56:53.616 --> 00:56:55.338]  And has there been a battle for thousands of years?
[00:56:55.378 --> 00:56:57.040]  Whether Europe or Russia will run Ukraine?
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:56:57.280]  Yeah.
[00:56:58.564 --> 00:57:02.946]  It's a very Germanic country in the West, a very Slavic country in the East.
[00:57:03.486 --> 00:57:04.286]  They're all intermarried.
[00:57:05.246 --> 00:57:07.967]  And that leads us to this.
[00:57:09.088 --> 00:57:16.670]  Russia has said that if you keep taking members in, it's an act of war.
[00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:17.391]  You gotta stop.
[00:57:17.671 --> 00:57:18.991]  We had an agreement in 1993 to not do this.
[00:57:19.011 --> 00:57:18.991]  1992.
[00:57:18.831 --> 00:57:29.520]   to not do this 1992 Finland will be a NATO backwater Russia threatens military and technical measures if it enters.
[00:57:29.981 --> 00:57:36.443]  Finland has now officially put in their application to enter NATO in the next 12 months.
[00:57:39.004 --> 00:57:42.305]  And Russia has now announced it's going to cut the power supply to Finland tomorrow.
[00:57:42.366 --> 00:57:43.306]  I mean, this is all out war.
[00:57:44.392 --> 00:57:49.618]  Rand Paul blocks $40 billion to Ukraine, citing inflation at home, lack of basic foodstuffs.
[00:57:50.419 --> 00:57:54.964]  French Open warns Russian players not to make political statements of support for Putin.
[00:57:55.024 --> 00:57:58.708]  An account that is saying you're just against the war and that there should be detente.
[00:58:00.194 --> 00:58:07.037]  Very important statements by Gozer, Congressman Gozer, Russia not our enemy, U.S.
[00:58:07.057 --> 00:58:07.617]  Congressman.
[00:58:08.018 --> 00:58:11.899]  I'm going to get to that later, but I want to go to your phone calls when we come back.
[00:58:11.939 --> 00:58:18.802]  We've also, as I said, got a bunch of censorship news, economy news, COVID news, transgender power grab news.
[00:58:19.303 --> 00:58:21.564]  Randy Weber died, good friend of mine, great patriot.
[00:58:22.424 --> 00:58:25.525]  And so much more on the other side.
[00:58:25.805 --> 00:58:27.226]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:27.566 --> 00:58:28.626]  There I'll let you share that link.
[00:58:28.826 --> 00:58:30.767]  Newswars.com is a clone.
[00:58:31.427 --> 00:58:33.288]  And Battleplan.news.
[00:58:34.588 --> 00:58:35.989]  All of my strength is from God.
[00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:39.310]  All of your strength is from God.
[00:58:43.351 --> 00:58:47.673]  My hand was strengthened by the hand of the Almighty.
[00:58:49.353 --> 00:58:50.814]  The beautiful voice of an angel.
[00:58:52.233 --> 00:58:52.833]  Bob Marley.
[00:58:52.853 --> 00:58:55.714]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:58:57.195 --> 00:58:59.496]  Then I've got the UN news and so much more to hit.
[00:59:00.336 --> 00:59:02.457]  I'll show you the show headline today that I wrote.
[00:59:02.937 --> 00:59:10.520]  Joe Biden is an effing enemy agent of the New World Order and is purposely starving and bankrupting our great nation.
[00:59:11.544 --> 00:59:13.805]  But he himself is just a puppet.
[00:59:14.445 --> 00:59:23.650]  Dementia-ridden Biden and his pack of lying scum are now claiming there's no baby formula shortage and they're not handing out crack pipes.
[00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:25.651]  They're lying to our face.
[00:59:28.193 --> 00:59:32.655]  Start your weekend with this explosive, one-of-a-kind edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:40.319]  Globalists want you to get high and die as they pillage the nation and escalate war.
[00:59:42.717 --> 00:59:44.178]  Against nuclear-powered Russia.
[00:59:47.979 --> 00:59:57.383]  All right, we got Jack, we got Rachel, we got Kim, we got Randy, we got Holy Stride, we got Daniel, we got Kevin, we got Sarah, we got Dave, we got Lee, we got Dylan, and we're taking the calls.
[00:59:57.903 --> 01:00:00.064]  And the order, they were received on...
[01:00:01.291 --> 01:00:04.192]  Filtered, uncensored, teleprompter free.
[01:00:04.612 --> 01:00:05.152]  It's real.
[01:00:05.772 --> 01:00:06.892]  What a rare thing today.
[01:00:07.873 --> 01:00:11.073]  Something the globalists don't like happening is happening now together.
[01:00:11.534 --> 01:00:12.354]  A ritual of freedom.
[01:00:13.194 --> 01:00:17.475]  Jack in South Carolina, thank you for calling on this Friday the 13th.
[01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:19.956]  Mr. Jones, thank you.
[01:00:22.156 --> 01:00:28.178]  I went to high school with Ted Turner's grandchildren and super nice people.
[01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:32.400]   I just don't see how they could be Red into all the stuff.
[01:00:33.081 --> 01:00:38.722]  I've seen that photo of him with Fauci and Bill Gates, his dad and several others.
[01:00:39.162 --> 01:00:43.443]  And I was just wondering if you what knowledge you had on him.
[01:00:43.883 --> 01:00:49.004]  And then also, I know it's better if it comes naturally from you.
[01:00:49.544 --> 01:00:55.825]  But thank you so much for opening my eyes to so much stuff and especially so much religious stuff.
[01:00:55.885 --> 01:01:07.114]   And I continue to fail and I think it's just so powerful when you pray for us, and if you could finish with a prayer one more time, I would really appreciate that.
[01:01:07.134 --> 01:01:07.794]  Alright, Jack.
[01:01:07.854 --> 01:01:08.734]  Thank you for everything.
[01:01:09.014 --> 01:01:10.155]  Let me try to answer your question.
[01:01:10.935 --> 01:01:13.156]  I don't go off photos of people together.
[01:01:13.896 --> 01:01:20.398]  Because somebody can jump up next to me and take a photo, or they can jump up next to you, you don't know who they are, or later they get in trouble and they say you're part of them.
[01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:24.479]  I go off what Ted Turner funded and did.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.300]  He was involved.
[01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:32.490]  40 years ago, setting up these private NGOs with the Bilderberg Group for what they built today.
[01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:36.031]  He says we only need 500 million people, maybe.
[01:01:38.652 --> 01:01:41.673]  Most of these really rich, powerful globalists don't even talk to their grandchildren.
[01:01:42.233 --> 01:01:44.094]  I know he says you shouldn't be able to have any children.
[01:01:44.114 --> 01:01:45.314]  I think he had six.
[01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:49.375]  And I think he's got like 25 grandchildren last time I checked.
[01:01:49.515 --> 01:01:50.135]  Guys, look that up.
[01:01:51.176 --> 01:01:54.757]  But you shouldn't have children.
[01:01:54.817 --> 01:01:55.737]  He's going to have children.
[01:01:56.604 --> 01:01:59.325]  And he was involved, of course, with the Georgia Guidestones and more.
[01:02:00.286 --> 01:02:02.526]  So we know who he is from his action.
[01:02:02.546 --> 01:02:05.228]  I made a film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:02:05.248 --> 01:02:06.968]  We show the documents, the proof, his statements.
[01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:09.469]  My first film I made in 1997.
[01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.310]  And it's all there.
[01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:12.390]  The film is still free online.
[01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.311]  You can find it by looking.
[01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:15.152]  So it's like on Rumble.
[01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:17.673]  Places, they've taken it down everywhere else.
[01:02:17.753 --> 01:02:21.896]  It's also on PrisonPlanet.tv, which used to be a subscriber site.
[01:02:21.916 --> 01:02:26.540]  Back when we were making plenty of money in 2016, I said, well, we've got plenty of money.
[01:02:28.961 --> 01:02:32.884]  And so PrisonPlanet.tv is no longer a subscriber, it's free.
[01:02:32.904 --> 01:02:36.067]  We used to bring in $5 million a year with it and fund the operation.
[01:02:36.687 --> 01:02:39.589]  But then later, we don't have the money to really pay the payroll.
[01:02:39.609 --> 01:02:40.310]  But that's OK.
[01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.371]  PrisonPlanet.tv is there.
[01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:43.932]  It's a real archive of everything.
[01:02:45.009 --> 01:02:49.450]  And I hope you'll find America Destroyed by Design there and repost it and share it.
[01:02:50.651 --> 01:02:54.172]  You know, Jack, I pray when it comes upon me to do it.
[01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:57.793]  It's not like I got on the show today, first hour, and said, I'm going to say a prayer later.
[01:02:57.813 --> 01:03:08.176]  I was praying during the break that the Holy Spirit would help me do a really good job and not just yell and scream, which is effective in ways.
[01:03:09.376 --> 01:03:11.396]  And so then it just came out of me to pray.
[01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:19.853]  Part of being human, Jack, and I appreciate your call, is that we are imperfect.
[01:03:19.973 --> 01:03:22.115]  The perfection is the imperfectness.
[01:03:22.695 --> 01:03:23.996]  And God completes us.
[01:03:24.637 --> 01:03:30.642]  And so just because you have a conscience and see your failings and want to fix those, doesn't mean you're a bad person.
[01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:37.428]  And so the mere fact that you care and that you say, I fail, well, I fail too, brother.
[01:03:38.969 --> 01:03:50.575]   And so I do pray that God strengthen you and let you understand that You are an imperfect vessel that God made you to only be complete when you find God.
[01:03:50.595 --> 01:03:53.276]  And so that's part of the process, my friend.
[01:03:54.537 --> 01:03:57.238]  All right, up next, let's talk to Rachel in Missouri.
[01:03:57.318 --> 01:03:58.198]  Rachel, you're on the air.
[01:03:58.238 --> 01:03:58.579]  Go ahead.
[01:04:00.019 --> 01:04:00.900]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:07.422]  I'm a first-time caller, and I just want to say thank you so much for being our voice.
[01:04:07.622 --> 01:04:13.065]  My husband, my kids, we're all InfoWarriors, and we totally appreciate you.
[01:04:14.335 --> 01:04:19.736]  We were listening yesterday to your broadcast about impeachment and calling for an impeachment for Biden.
[01:04:20.136 --> 01:04:27.858]  So I went ahead and I jumped on the phone to a congressman and got hit through to his office and I had asked, they said, well, what are the plans?
[01:04:27.938 --> 01:04:29.879]  You know, are you guys planning on doing anything?
[01:04:29.919 --> 01:04:30.739]  He is a Republican.
[01:04:31.279 --> 01:04:33.080]  I said, you know, are you planning anything?
[01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:37.819]   And the person who answered the phone said, "Well, you know, since Congress is basically
[01:04:37.819 --> 01:04:42.420]   run by the Democrats, you know, any articles of impeachment that we would bring up would
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.420]  be shut down."
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:45.420]  And I said, "Have there been any calls?"
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.378]  And he said, "Well, I think there might have been."
[01:04:47.378 --> 01:04:51.739]   And I had asked directly, "Well, did Congressman Smith, did he go ahead and participate in
[01:04:51.739 --> 01:04:54.259]  any of those articles of impeachment?
[01:04:54.259 --> 01:04:57.420]  Did he raise his hand and say, 'I'm a part of it'?"
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.859]  And the person on the telephone said, "No.
[01:04:59.859 --> 01:05:01.699]  No, he hasn't."
[01:05:01.699 --> 01:05:07.978]   And I think your call yesterday for people to go ahead and be more on board with the
[01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:14.338]   impeachment of Biden, if all of us call up our representatives in Congress and take part
[01:05:14.338 --> 01:05:21.699]   of, you know, do our little part here, everybody calls, I think it will make a big difference.
[01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:22.252]  Don't hang up.
[01:05:22.292 --> 01:05:23.393]  I want to come back and talk to you more.
[01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:24.193]  Please stay with us.
[01:05:26.093 --> 01:05:26.694]  Absolutely.
[01:05:27.054 --> 01:05:30.235]  And again, I told you when you call them, they're going to go, well, we don't control Congress.
[01:05:30.295 --> 01:05:31.155]  It's not about that.
[01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:32.335]  It's about you're supposed to do it.
[01:05:32.816 --> 01:05:39.978]  And then it'll make Democrats go on record supporting the inflation, supporting the open borders and the crime so that we'll get the impeachment after the midterm.
[01:05:40.908 --> 01:05:44.191]  And not, oh well he's weak, he makes Democrats look bad, leave him in.
[01:05:45.132 --> 01:05:49.857]  He's destroying the country and starving everybody and shut off the pipelines and oil and gas drilling.
[01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:51.558]  So we have to remove him.
[01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:54.941]  Live from Freedom Command Central.
[01:05:56.062 --> 01:05:58.425]  Okay my wonderful listeners and viewers and activists.
[01:05:59.454 --> 01:06:08.139]  I want to go back to Rachel here in a moment, but I want to be just so clear on this, that when I know I'm right about something, I'm right just like you know you're right, and you know when I say it, it's right.
[01:06:08.179 --> 01:06:11.340]  You don't have to be a genius to know this.
[01:06:13.382 --> 01:06:23.187]  The Republican leadership bullies and controls and threatens anybody that doesn't get in the New World Order line, and they pretend like they're against the agenda.
[01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:31.978]  And they hate Trump, not because he's perfect, but because he was leading in all these new populists and people that this show and other broadcasts woke up.
[01:06:32.518 --> 01:06:33.839]  I'll talk about that after the caller leaves.
[01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:42.246]  But understanding where this came from and where it was born is beyond critical.
[01:06:43.047 --> 01:06:45.088]  It's absolutely important to understand.
[01:06:45.909 --> 01:07:02.259]   And so that's why I said yesterday, and I spent an hour on it, when you Call your Congress, man or woman, and when you tell them, hey, I want you to impeach, they're going to respond, we don't control the House and Senate.
[01:07:02.299 --> 01:07:04.821]  Well, the Democrats did that before they won back in the House and Senate.
[01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:05.041]  Why?
[01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:18.732]  Because it's a bully pulpit and a way, even if you don't control the hearings, to be able to push it out and show, hey, they opened the border, they violated Title 42 in law, which the courts say they can't do, but they're still doing it.
[01:07:19.947 --> 01:07:25.489]  They are the ones flooding us with at least 18,000 being housed a day coming across.
[01:07:25.529 --> 01:07:27.770]  They think they catch like one out of eight, so do the math.
[01:07:29.231 --> 01:07:32.612]  We're talking seven times at least making it through.
[01:07:33.013 --> 01:07:33.733]  It's insane!
[01:07:36.044 --> 01:07:44.968]  And so on those issues, you make it a campaign issue with the impeachment about the open borders and the treason and about the inflation shutting off the pipelines.
[01:07:45.288 --> 01:07:46.489]  It's cut and dry.
[01:07:47.009 --> 01:07:53.352]  It will cause not just a landslide, not just a political realignment, but a total shift.
[01:07:55.293 --> 01:08:01.856]  And Mitch McConnell and all the rest of them, Kevin McCarthy, know that.
[01:08:04.031 --> 01:08:09.433]  And they are losing the ball game on purpose because they're CHICOM agents on record.
[01:08:09.453 --> 01:08:11.594]  I'm not going to go into the 50 hours of evidence.
[01:08:11.614 --> 01:08:12.314]  You know it already.
[01:08:14.314 --> 01:08:18.516]  So what I'm telling you is a default no brainer.
[01:08:20.317 --> 01:08:21.397]  It's like in a football game.
[01:08:21.617 --> 01:08:23.298]  Hey, let's put our 11 players on the field.
[01:08:24.238 --> 01:08:25.218]  It's not even a discussion.
[01:08:25.558 --> 01:08:30.380]  If you don't put players on the field, you don't even participate and you forfeit the game.
[01:08:31.545 --> 01:08:33.306]  We're not putting players on the field.
[01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:37.428]  We got almost 50 Congress people that were Republicans.
[01:08:38.108 --> 01:08:41.210]  Notice now the anti-war Democrats all voted for the 40 million for Ukraine.
[01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:53.856]  We have, it's 50 plus, Republicans that voted against, 54, got the number here, 54, 53, that voted against this because they understand it's collapsing our country.
[01:08:55.077 --> 01:08:57.718]  And it's a fraud, it's a black hole of money laundering.
[01:08:59.662 --> 01:09:07.110]  And so, when you call these congresspeople's minions, you say, listen, I'm going to come down to the public event in Bullhorn and make a big deal about it if you don't listen to me.
[01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:08.412]  I'll be friendly if you listen.
[01:09:08.732 --> 01:09:15.419]  I don't give a rat's ass what Mitch McConnell's going to tell you or what any of these people are going to tell you.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:31.706]  You have a job to start impeachment over violation of federal law of the open border, cut and dry, and cutting off the Keystone Pipeline and thousands of other pipelines, and killing tens of thousands, I mean, basically almost all of the oil lease permits.
[01:09:32.226 --> 01:09:34.707]  So, it's cut and dry.
[01:09:35.067 --> 01:09:35.748]  Cut and dry.
[01:09:37.708 --> 01:09:38.269]  Red-handed.
[01:09:38.509 --> 01:09:39.349]  Hand in the cookie jar.
[01:09:39.629 --> 01:09:39.929]  Done.
[01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:41.650]  Done.
[01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:43.811]  It is a political winner.
[01:09:44.711 --> 01:09:48.892]  It's like having an all-star team play Little League football.
[01:09:49.392 --> 01:09:55.233]  It'd be like if you had the best players in the NFL, a hundred of them on a team, playing five-year-olds.
[01:09:55.493 --> 01:09:58.334]  There's not even a decision here.
[01:09:58.654 --> 01:10:00.234]  Total victory is in our hands.
[01:10:00.674 --> 01:10:03.835]  But they control the top, so we never get the common sense.
[01:10:04.915 --> 01:10:08.296]  We'd have freaking space bases all the way out past Pluto right now.
[01:10:08.336 --> 01:10:09.256]  These people weren't in our way.
[01:10:09.516 --> 01:10:10.676]  We'd have life extension.
[01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:11.536]  We'd have everything.
[01:10:11.856 --> 01:10:13.157]  They're in our way.
[01:10:13.217 --> 01:10:14.217]  Get behind me, Satan.
[01:10:16.806 --> 01:10:21.956]  So when I talk up here, and I should write an article and give points to this, this is understanding politics and how it works.
[01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:25.322]  You're going to call and they're going to say, well, we don't have control.
[01:10:27.984 --> 01:10:28.944]  And that'll make him a victim.
[01:10:28.964 --> 01:10:29.364]  No, it won't.
[01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:33.846]  You have a job because he's sabotaging the country and destroying it.
[01:10:33.966 --> 01:10:34.746]  Yeah, he's a puppet.
[01:10:34.786 --> 01:10:35.607]  Yeah, he's got dementia.
[01:10:35.647 --> 01:10:42.229]  But the people that run him, Obama, the third Obama administration that stole the election has this puppet.
[01:10:42.429 --> 01:10:44.349]  And so we should say impeach Obama.
[01:10:44.710 --> 01:10:48.531]  It should be called the impeachment of Barack Obama's rogue government.
[01:10:50.751 --> 01:10:51.892]  Everything I'm saying is total victory.
[01:10:52.452 --> 01:10:53.252]  Every bit of this will win.
[01:10:53.512 --> 01:10:54.233]  Every bit of this is true.
[01:10:54.733 --> 01:11:01.596]  This is absolute total victory and stopping them in your hands now.
[01:11:02.077 --> 01:11:04.218]  That's why they listen to this show and pull their hair out.
[01:11:04.238 --> 01:11:05.758]  They're like, this guy's got our number.
[01:11:06.539 --> 01:11:10.381]  I'll use the Star Wars analogy of Episode 4, The Death Star Codes.
[01:11:11.678 --> 01:11:13.099]  Stolen at the Battle of Yavin.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.540]  Hundreds of thousands died to get them.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.141]  It doesn't matter.
[01:11:16.361 --> 01:11:18.382]  You now have the codes to the reactor shaft.
[01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:20.884]  You fire the torpedoes down it, it blows up.
[01:11:22.785 --> 01:11:29.869]  And I'm in the trench with you, and the Republicans won't even load missiles on to the frickin' X-Wings.
[01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.531]  Load the missiles.
[01:11:34.332 --> 01:11:35.773]  Fire the missiles, politically.
[01:11:36.453 --> 01:11:37.173]  Destroy the enemy.
[01:11:37.914 --> 01:11:39.615]  Politically, in a loving, non-violent way.
[01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:43.867]  That's where we are.
[01:11:45.929 --> 01:11:46.449]  And they know it.
[01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:51.272]  Can you imagine impeachment hearings about baby formula?
[01:11:51.693 --> 01:11:53.074]  Impeachment hearings about inflation?
[01:11:53.374 --> 01:11:54.975]  Impeachment hearings about Keystone Pipeline?
[01:11:55.295 --> 01:11:58.137]  Impeachment hearings about giant human trafficking of kidnapped children?
[01:11:58.437 --> 01:11:59.538]  Game over!
[01:12:03.461 --> 01:12:08.421]   Game over, game over, game over, game over, game over, game over, and we're sitting here
[01:12:08.421 --> 01:12:13.980]   with the keys to protect our children, with the keys to have our future, with the keys
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:29.820]   to prosperity, and we won't even load the torpedoes on the X-Wing to launch it to attack.
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:31.541]  Our enemies are weak.
[01:12:31.536 --> 01:12:33.418]  Our enemies are blackmailing each other.
[01:12:33.658 --> 01:12:35.559]  Our enemies are inbred and satanic.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.560]  They are scum!
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:45.560]  What does that make us if we don't know anything about them?
[01:12:45.807 --> 01:12:47.949]  So yes, I know what they're going to do when you call.
[01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:50.291]  And you say, listen here.
[01:12:51.721 --> 01:12:52.602]  People are starving.
[01:12:52.882 --> 01:12:54.163]  They're smuggling children across.
[01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.464]  They've turned the pipelines off.
[01:12:55.925 --> 01:12:58.607]  I mean, what if Biden just turns the goddamn... Excuse me, Lord, forgive me.
[01:12:58.947 --> 01:13:01.209]  What if Biden just turns the electricity off?
[01:13:01.389 --> 01:13:03.231]  Would we do any... Oh, oh, sorry!
[01:13:03.251 --> 01:13:05.213]  He turned the electricity off.
[01:13:05.813 --> 01:13:07.435]  Uh, we're not in power yet.
[01:13:07.495 --> 01:13:09.536]  We can't... What are you talking about?
[01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:13.159]  It'll make Democrats line up and support cutting off the pipelines.
[01:13:14.068 --> 01:13:16.291]  It'll make them line up and support the human smuggling they already are.
[01:13:16.551 --> 01:13:18.133]  It'll put them on the hot seat.
[01:13:18.453 --> 01:13:19.935]  It'll put them in the star chamber.
[01:13:20.215 --> 01:13:21.957]  It'll put their ass in the fire!
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.241]  And thank God, Rachel gets it.
[01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:26.823]  And Rachel called.
[01:13:27.945 --> 01:13:28.886]  And everybody else should.
[01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:33.892]  To let them know...
[01:13:35.339 --> 01:13:37.300]  That we are watching and we know what they've done.
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:40.362]  And we want to know who's going to vote for impeachment and who isn't.
[01:13:40.662 --> 01:13:44.304]  Because if you don't do it, you're part of the problem.
[01:13:44.344 --> 01:13:45.004]  Rachel, go ahead.
[01:13:46.605 --> 01:13:48.126]  Alex, it's brilliant.
[01:13:48.266 --> 01:13:48.726]  It really is.
[01:13:48.766 --> 01:13:52.608]  Because like I was saying, my husband and I, we were talking about what can we do.
[01:13:53.309 --> 01:14:03.634]  We could hold up signs outside of Walmart, you know, but calling our representatives and urging other InfoWars listeners to do the same and be honest.
[01:14:03.935 --> 01:14:12.696]   I mean, just because My representative says he's a Republican, but he hasn't done anything to go ahead and support the people that he represents.
[01:14:13.317 --> 01:14:19.245]  We're all in this right now with the sky-high inflation.
[01:14:19.682 --> 01:14:22.264]  With the gas prices going nuts, though.
[01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:25.606]  I mean, what are our representatives doing for us?
[01:14:26.267 --> 01:14:30.950]  That piece of garbage stole the election and now we're going to remove him through impeachment.
[01:14:31.190 --> 01:14:34.852]  And I'm telling you, if they bring up articles and really put forward evidence, he'll be removed.
[01:14:35.072 --> 01:14:36.333]  The Democrats are sick of this.
[01:14:36.714 --> 01:14:39.215]  The average Democrat doesn't want to destroy their family, it's the leadership.
[01:14:39.696 --> 01:14:41.497]  He is a sitting duck.
[01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:44.011]  You are brilliant.
[01:14:44.232 --> 01:14:47.595]  I think this is a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful idea.
[01:14:48.076 --> 01:14:52.020]  Everybody has to get on board and start calling up their representative.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:52.921]  God bless you, Rachel.
[01:14:52.961 --> 01:14:53.502]  Keep doing it.
[01:14:53.542 --> 01:14:54.403]  Keep doing it and thank you.
[01:14:54.964 --> 01:14:55.925]  But I gotta be honest here.
[01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:57.106]  If I'm...
[01:14:58.305 --> 01:14:59.245]  Being held underwater.
[01:14:59.706 --> 01:15:01.386]  I'm gonna fight who's holding me underwater and go for air.
[01:15:01.726 --> 01:15:03.687]  It's not, survival is not brilliant.
[01:15:04.448 --> 01:15:16.113]  They have a job, this guy is involved in treason, you don't do the hunter laptop and side distractions, and you cut the Justice Department out of it, and you use Congress, and you go with impeachment.
[01:15:16.853 --> 01:15:22.335]  And you may not get him this time, but you will expose who's behind it with the biggest bully pulpit out there.
[01:15:22.756 --> 01:15:25.977]  But the Republican leadership wants to suppress you because they're part of the problem.
[01:15:27.301 --> 01:15:31.364]  Taking on the Satanist at point-blank range.
[01:15:31.624 --> 01:15:32.384]  We are the InfoWar.
[01:15:32.404 --> 01:15:36.387]  We're going to go right back to your phone calls, but I want to say something very important here.
[01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:40.451]  When the globalists really panicked and actually looked at our numbers, they hadn't done it.
[01:15:40.471 --> 01:15:41.251]  They were so arrogant.
[01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:54.155]  Six years ago, in 2016, in July, in Cleveland, we paid for big Jumbotron trucks that had big TV screens on both sides to drive around exposing Hillary and her crimes to the New World Order.
[01:15:54.735 --> 01:15:56.436]  We paid for airplanes to fly around.
[01:15:56.976 --> 01:16:03.538]  And our listeners showed up, of the hundreds of thousands that were there, and a third of the people were wearing Infowars.com t-shirts.
[01:16:04.218 --> 01:16:06.500]  And the left just went apoplectic.
[01:16:06.921 --> 01:16:09.884]  They didn't understand that we understood the grassroots.
[01:16:09.964 --> 01:16:11.025]  We believed in America.
[01:16:11.485 --> 01:16:13.828]  We believed in every race, color, and creed that loves freedom.
[01:16:14.228 --> 01:16:23.637]  And that crowd of black, white, Hispanic, old, young, male, female, gay, straight, that diverse crowd made them just panic.
[01:16:24.979 --> 01:16:27.081]  And all their attacks actually made us stronger in many ways.
[01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:37.666]  And that's why there's a symbiotic relationship here and a real big win-win if you'll just listen to me and decide to do it.
[01:16:37.986 --> 01:16:40.166]  Because there are millions of people listening right now.
[01:16:42.647 --> 01:16:50.468]  And if you would just decide to call up the toll-free number or go online and get the Alex Jones was right shirt or another Infowars shirt.
[01:16:50.488 --> 01:16:52.449]  We're selling out all the old stock at cost.
[01:16:52.789 --> 01:16:55.850]  The Infowars Alex Jones was right shirt is being sold for $24.95 for funding.
[01:16:57.754 --> 01:17:06.396]  You'd get a great shirt that wakes people up, you'd meet like-minded people in red areas, get your dinner bought for you probably, and meet your new best friend in a blue area, you might get stabbed in the back.
[01:17:06.716 --> 01:17:09.317]  The point is, what an adventure wearing an InfoWars shirt.
[01:17:09.757 --> 01:17:30.308]   If everybody would just go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a couple of these t-shirts for your husband, your wife, your neighbor, your son, your daughter, your grandpa, your grandma, your niece, your nephew, it would fund us But more importantly, it's something that shows a symbol of freedom, a uniform out there in the real world.
[01:17:30.368 --> 01:17:33.492]  So, we've had them on back order.
[01:17:33.733 --> 01:17:35.015]  We got the first run of like 10,000.
[01:17:35.075 --> 01:17:35.776]  They sold out in a week.
[01:17:35.796 --> 01:17:36.316]  20,000 are coming in Monday.
[01:17:40.646 --> 01:17:46.694]  And then we have a designer one that's of a super fancy fabric made in America that costs us like 18 bucks to make.
[01:17:46.754 --> 01:17:47.975]  We're selling that for 40 bucks.
[01:17:48.436 --> 01:17:49.537]  There'll be that designer shirt.
[01:17:49.578 --> 01:17:50.278]  There'll be this shirt.
[01:17:50.779 --> 01:17:52.221]  And the run we just had come in.
[01:17:52.241 --> 01:17:53.182]  We'll do a new design later.
[01:17:53.362 --> 01:17:53.743]  That's it.
[01:17:53.763 --> 01:17:54.504]  It's a limited edition.
[01:17:54.524 --> 01:17:55.826]  And there'll be the designer shirt.
[01:17:57.048 --> 01:18:01.410]  But both 18-wheelers are showing up on Monday with a designer shirt and this shirt.
[01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:03.551]  By the way, this is a really nice fabric, really well-done shirt.
[01:18:03.871 --> 01:18:04.971]  I'd say it's a five-star shirt.
[01:18:04.991 --> 01:18:08.573]  Get your Alex Jones is Right shirt at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:13.275]  And it is a metaphysical action of tithing to the truth and to spread the word.
[01:18:13.515 --> 01:18:14.335]  It'll change the world.
[01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:15.456]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:18:15.476 --> 01:18:20.978]  If you haven't got an Alex Jones was Right shirt, or maybe you bought one for yourself and you love it, get another for friends and family, or buy five of them.
[01:18:21.498 --> 01:18:23.139]  The point is, we need your support.

[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:29.903]  Also, X2, we only got 15,000 bottles.
[01:18:30.703 --> 01:18:35.866]  We had an order in for a year, because we have to stagger them out now, because of supply chain breakdowns, look at the baby formula, everything.
[01:18:36.206 --> 01:18:39.908]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, we get it from the oil companies, from 7,000 to 12,000 feet under the ground.
[01:18:41.564 --> 01:18:43.243]  It's reportedly billions of years old.
[01:18:43.243 --> 01:18:45.003]  It goes right into your blood, right into your cells.
[01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:46.003]  It's not bound to anything.
[01:18:46.003 --> 01:18:47.003]  It's amazing.
[01:18:47.003 --> 01:18:48.003]  It's 25% off.
[01:18:48.003 --> 01:18:49.003]  It's going to sell out very soon.

[01:19:03.884 --> 01:19:04.884]  All right.
[01:19:04.884 --> 01:19:06.884]  I took three calls in the last 30, 40 minutes.
[01:19:06.884 --> 01:19:10.564]   I'm going to do a better job now, but the lady was bringing up something really important.
[01:19:10.564 --> 01:19:14.084]  We got so many great callers, been holding a long time.
[01:19:14.246 --> 01:19:16.087]  Let's talk to Kim in Arkansas.
[01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.388]  Kim, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:19:19.450 --> 01:19:21.692]  Alejandro, powerful show.
[01:19:21.772 --> 01:19:22.612]  I'm fired up.
[01:19:24.194 --> 01:19:25.274]  The Force is with us, brother.
[01:19:25.315 --> 01:19:25.675]  I love you.
[01:19:25.695 --> 01:19:26.035]  What's up?
[01:19:27.036 --> 01:19:27.536]  Thank you.
[01:19:27.636 --> 01:19:37.464]  Revelation 15 tells us that the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ.
[01:19:37.664 --> 01:19:41.427]  This theme is repeated all throughout Scripture.
[01:19:42.307 --> 01:19:54.036]  Now, if his reign has no end, and if his kingdom began in his public ministry in A.D.
[01:19:54.056 --> 01:20:15.706]   70, and if his kingdom was consummated at the fall and desolation of the old covenant system, then that means that his kingdom reigns It can never be destroyed, and that means that we're going to win.
[01:20:15.726 --> 01:20:16.346]  Well, that's right.
[01:20:16.426 --> 01:20:17.587]  God has already won.
[01:20:17.627 --> 01:20:19.528]  The devil just wants to take a bunch of people with him.
[01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:23.291]  You know, absolutely.
[01:20:23.531 --> 01:20:40.179]   And I think that if his children would research the scripture and realize, Alex, that The destruction of the old covenant system is the key.
[01:20:40.639 --> 01:20:41.820]  We're in a new kingdom.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.121]  We're in the new covenant.
[01:20:43.461 --> 01:20:45.883]  And believers don't know their game plan.
[01:20:46.444 --> 01:20:49.726]  But our enemy knows God's game plan.
[01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:52.248]  That's right, and follows it.
[01:20:52.268 --> 01:20:56.371]  And notice, Titus sacked Jerusalem in 70 AD.
[01:20:56.431 --> 01:21:02.075]  Christ said, before you're dead to these young people, not a stone will be left on top of the other.
[01:21:02.575 --> 01:21:04.757]  That was a symbol of the old covenant being destroyed right there.
[01:21:06.451 --> 01:21:16.935]  He told all of his generation and his ministry, this generation will not pass away until all of these things are fulfilled.
[01:21:17.295 --> 01:21:18.675]  What were all of those things?
[01:21:18.955 --> 01:21:23.317]  They were all of the Old Testament prophetic words.
[01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:26.257]  Now, his kingdom began in AD 70.
[01:21:28.567 --> 01:21:30.048]  You said it today.
[01:21:30.448 --> 01:21:31.968]  We are winning.
[01:21:32.268 --> 01:21:35.729]  God's kingdom, Jesus' kingdom can never be destroyed.
[01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:37.470]  Oh, it's not even in the discussion.
[01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:38.370]  It's not even in the debate.
[01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:39.171]  God made the world.
[01:21:40.411 --> 01:21:40.791]  Pardon me?
[01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:42.532]  God made the world.
[01:21:42.572 --> 01:21:43.512]  God made consciousness.
[01:21:43.532 --> 01:21:43.952]  Exactly.
[01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:44.853]  It's all a test.
[01:21:44.913 --> 01:21:47.133]  It's all a big joke for the Satanists thinking they can win.
[01:21:47.153 --> 01:21:47.734]  They've already lost.
[01:21:47.994 --> 01:21:48.854]  And the devil knows that.
[01:21:50.174 --> 01:21:59.966]   I think when we understand that we're in God's kingdom, then everything that you've been revealing to us for decades comes into perspective.
[01:21:59.966 --> 01:22:04.845]   Because here's the deal, I believe according to scripture and what I've experienced in my life,
[01:22:04.845 --> 01:22:12.386]   I believe that sometime these people sold out whoever or whatever this evil force is,
[01:22:12.386 --> 01:22:18.206]   and once they did that, I think they're locked in, now they realize they can't get out,
[01:22:18.206 --> 01:22:21.405]  they gotta destroy us before they're destroyed.
[01:22:21.405 --> 01:22:24.246]  Oh, that's exactly how it works, brother.
[01:22:25.925 --> 01:22:30.926]   So I just wanna encourage you and everybody, you're powerful, brother.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:33.022]  You're the greatest voice on planet Earth.
[01:22:33.122 --> 01:22:34.423]  I say that to everybody.
[01:22:34.864 --> 01:22:37.085]  And you're going to go down in history.
[01:22:37.846 --> 01:22:57.603]   If believers realize that we're winning, and if they'll get their information from the Word of God, not these, you know, big-time preachers who have, you know, the Rothschilds, are behind the John Darby dispensational rapture of the church.
[01:22:57.703 --> 01:22:59.044]  No, you're right, they are.
[01:22:59.124 --> 01:23:01.404]  And again, people say, well, wait, it's all predestined.
[01:23:01.464 --> 01:23:04.645]  No, there's predestined plans, but we, it's up to us.
[01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:08.787]  It's kind of like the choose your adventure books when you're a kid, where there's four or five ways it can end.
[01:23:08.807 --> 01:23:12.228]  And that's literally, it's, we have free will.
[01:23:12.408 --> 01:23:13.428]  God already has a plan.
[01:23:13.828 --> 01:23:14.649]  It's going to be fulfilled.
[01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.110]   The question is, How bad is it going to be going through this?
[01:23:18.330 --> 01:23:21.172]  Or can we lessen it like Nineveh got a hundred year reprieve?
[01:23:21.212 --> 01:23:25.134]  And you know, we're all synced up here understanding God's kingdom began in 70 AD.
[01:23:25.474 --> 01:23:26.575]  The old covenant was gone.
[01:23:27.816 --> 01:23:30.958]  And that is where we are in the new covenant.
[01:23:31.378 --> 01:23:32.799]  And then this is the big test.
[01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:35.420]  There'll be one more test after the thousand year reign.
[01:23:36.141 --> 01:23:37.061]  And that's where we are.
[01:23:37.121 --> 01:23:37.721]  God bless you, sir.
[01:23:37.761 --> 01:23:38.622]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:23:39.462 --> 01:23:39.943]  Powerful.
[01:23:40.503 --> 01:23:42.544]  I'm going to go to another caller, but you only got two minutes for going to break.
[01:23:42.604 --> 01:23:46.330]   So I'm going to Go to Holy Stride in California.
[01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:47.150]  Welcome, Holy Stride.
[01:23:49.671 --> 01:23:50.932]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:23:51.572 --> 01:23:52.312]  I love your show.
[01:23:52.372 --> 01:23:53.593]  I've been listening for a long time.
[01:23:55.314 --> 01:23:57.975]  I want to add kind of what the last caller said.
[01:23:57.995 --> 01:23:58.935]  He kind of beat me to it.
[01:23:59.115 --> 01:24:11.981]  It seems like everything you've said is, a lot of it, most of it has happened now, and people are so scared and fearful of what can come based on you being right, and I think it's obvious now.
[01:24:12.876 --> 01:24:22.863]  Many people I know personally, when I talk to them about this, they don't really want to hear it because they don't know what to do about it and they're scared and I think that that comes from... No, you're right.
[01:24:22.923 --> 01:24:25.584]  They can't beat it and God can beat it.
[01:24:25.804 --> 01:24:26.625]  The answer is God.
[01:24:27.946 --> 01:24:29.927]  Yeah, but I agree totally.
[01:24:29.947 --> 01:24:39.791]   I just wanted to stay with that, that maybe perhaps there has to be, in my opinion, some sort of It's all going to get fulfilled.
[01:24:40.131 --> 01:24:42.832]  Antichrist, world government, mass extermination.
[01:24:42.692 --> 01:24:46.091]   masses and people have to hear it because when they hear it and understand
[01:24:46.091 --> 01:24:49.811]   the scripture as many Christians... Hold on, don't hang up, I'm gonna come back to you in
[01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:53.332]   two minutes we start the next hour. Well here's the good part about it, it's all
[01:24:53.332 --> 01:24:56.692]   gonna get fulfilled, Antichrist, world government, mass extermination, and so
[01:24:56.692 --> 01:25:00.792]   people are gonna have to get the real God because that's all they got. I mean
[01:25:00.792 --> 01:25:04.931]  folks you will have nothing, you will own nothing.
[01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:06.163]  They are, this is all gonna go down.
[01:25:06.224 --> 01:25:07.885]  But it's okay, because they lose.
[01:25:09.285 --> 01:25:13.068]  They get a very short period, you can debate how long, a year, two years.
[01:25:13.728 --> 01:25:14.829]  It's gonna be bad.
[01:25:14.869 --> 01:25:16.170]  You're just seeing the beta test now.
[01:25:16.450 --> 01:25:17.490]  But it's over after that.
[01:25:18.231 --> 01:25:18.471]  Alright?
[01:25:19.692 --> 01:25:20.552]  So, understand that.
[01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:26.256]  Understand, ladies and gentlemen, the only way you win is gutting up and realizing you're gonna have to take your licks.
[01:25:26.456 --> 01:25:27.937]  I'm gonna have to take them, you're gonna have to take them.
[01:25:28.942 --> 01:25:33.574]  I mean, they're probably going to chop my head off, folks, and that's fine, because I'll be in Jesus' arms.
[01:25:33.675 --> 01:25:53.795]  We'll be right back.
[01:25:53.825 --> 01:26:01.008]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:26:01.428 --> 01:26:03.649]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:26:04.369 --> 01:26:11.013]  That's why I want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.

[01:26:45.676 --> 01:26:46.937]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:26:47.017 --> 01:26:47.678]  Please take action.
[01:26:48.024 --> 01:27:02.730]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:12.070]   People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:14.570]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:17.570]  [laughter]
[01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:20.070]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:23.070]  [laughter]
[01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:25.570]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:27:25.570 --> 01:27:28.570]  [laughter]
[01:27:28.631 --> 01:27:31.555]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:27:31.816 --> 01:27:33.819]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:27:33.899 --> 01:27:36.603]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:27:38.715 --> 01:27:44.738]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:27:45.098 --> 01:27:51.940]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:27:52.021 --> 01:27:56.983]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:27:57.003 --> 01:27:59.884]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:27:59.944 --> 01:28:04.125]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:28:04.246 --> 01:28:07.227]  We have to work with dark side, or we will spend time in the shadows.
[01:28:08.488 --> 01:28:12.453]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.334]  Well, join me.
[01:28:13.874 --> 01:28:16.197]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:28:16.237 --> 01:28:18.059]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:28:19.601 --> 01:28:20.102]  Someday.
[01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:22.805]  In the next few years.
[01:28:22.625 --> 01:28:29.625]  is. A solution will emerge.
[01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:32.625]  [Music]
[01:28:32.625 --> 01:28:35.625]  [Music]
[01:28:35.625 --> 01:28:38.625]  [Music]
[01:28:38.625 --> 01:28:44.625]  [Music]
[01:28:44.625 --> 01:28:50.625]  [Music]
[01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:58.625]  [Music]
[01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:06.625]  [Music]
[01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:13.625]  [Music]
[01:29:13.625 --> 01:29:20.625]  [Music]
[01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:29.625]  [Music]
[01:29:30.625 --> 01:29:33.625]  [Music]
[01:29:33.625 --> 01:29:39.625]  [Music]
[01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:55.625]   Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.565]  I am now completely banned.
[01:29:57.605 --> 01:30:01.607]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[01:30:01.907 --> 01:30:02.948]  I want them shut down.
[01:30:02.988 --> 01:30:03.909]  I want them silenced.
[01:30:03.949 --> 01:30:04.729]  I want them muted.
[01:30:04.789 --> 01:30:06.610]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:30:06.670 --> 01:30:08.171]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:30:08.551 --> 01:30:14.378]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[01:30:14.478 --> 01:30:21.407]  These are very extreme individuals and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[01:30:21.487 --> 01:30:25.231]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[01:30:25.531 --> 01:30:28.515]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:30:28.835 --> 01:30:31.017]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[01:30:31.037 --> 01:30:32.819]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:30:32.639 --> 01:30:39.438]   Alex Jones and other Infowars pages had just simply circumvented any ban by
[01:30:39.438 --> 01:30:43.359]   starting a different account or going on Instagram. If you don't like someone on
[01:30:43.359 --> 01:30:47.318]   Facebook don't follow them. It's not that hard to figure out. Facebook are you
[01:30:47.318 --> 01:30:50.158]  gonna do something about the liberals who call me the n-word?
[01:30:50.158 --> 01:30:56.599]   No, because big tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[01:30:54.677 --> 01:30:55.978]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[01:30:56.058 --> 01:30:59.221]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[01:30:59.341 --> 01:31:04.365]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[01:31:04.425 --> 01:31:08.489]  Social media's hall monitor, Brian Stoker, was not very happy about it.
[01:31:08.549 --> 01:31:11.692]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[01:31:11.872 --> 01:31:14.153]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency.
[01:31:14.793 --> 01:31:21.314]  I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[01:31:21.694 --> 01:31:24.335]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[01:31:24.435 --> 01:31:26.755]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[01:31:27.015 --> 01:31:28.036]  I want them shut down.
[01:31:28.096 --> 01:31:29.016]  I want them silenced.
[01:31:29.076 --> 01:31:29.756]  I want them muted.
[01:31:29.776 --> 01:31:31.756]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:31:31.856 --> 01:31:33.197]  I want them shut down!
[01:31:33.217 --> 01:31:34.737]  I want them silenced!
[01:31:34.757 --> 01:31:35.537]  I want them muted!
[01:31:35.757 --> 01:31:36.717]  Don't worry.
[01:31:37.298 --> 01:31:38.998]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[01:31:40.614 --> 01:31:47.708]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:49.131 --> 01:31:50.173]  From the front lines!
[01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:56.971]  And there's nowhere I want to be better than the front lines of the information war.
[01:31:57.992 --> 01:32:00.332]  Holy Stride got cut off by the end of the hour.
[01:32:00.852 --> 01:32:02.013]  He was making some really good points.
[01:32:02.053 --> 01:32:08.474]  We're going to go back to him and then everybody in the order their calls are received here on this live Friday the 13th transmission.
[01:32:09.034 --> 01:32:10.234]  All right, go ahead.
[01:32:11.295 --> 01:32:11.975]  He just dropped.
[01:32:12.015 --> 01:32:12.955]  I was going right back to him.
[01:32:13.015 --> 01:32:13.995]  Okay, well, that's all right.
[01:32:14.075 --> 01:32:14.836]  Good to have you call.
[01:32:15.156 --> 01:32:15.996]  Appreciate that.
[01:32:16.116 --> 01:32:17.776]  Daniel in North Carolina.
[01:32:17.816 --> 01:32:18.536]  Daniel, welcome.
[01:32:20.077 --> 01:32:20.537]  Hey, Alex.
[01:32:21.748 --> 01:32:36.088]  I wanted to start off first by thanking you for coming in and bringing the truth every day, and even if that's what God called you to do, and that's your self-preservation, you made the choice to crawl through it every day, and I appreciate that, and we all need it.
[01:32:36.368 --> 01:32:37.650]  You're the only one we can come to.
[01:32:38.328 --> 01:32:39.309]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:32:39.369 --> 01:32:42.552]  I want you to know that being through this has been great, actually.
[01:32:43.093 --> 01:32:44.794]  It's been painful, but it's made me a better man.
[01:32:44.835 --> 01:32:50.280]  So I want listeners to know, persecution when you're doing the right thing only becomes sweet in the end.
[01:32:51.741 --> 01:32:52.722]  It's bittersweet, brother.
[01:32:53.003 --> 01:32:56.206]  So I get to talk to you and to talk to so many other beautiful souls.
[01:32:56.246 --> 01:32:57.247]  So I appreciate you, Daniel.
[01:32:58.368 --> 01:33:01.231]  Well, my topic today will be cultural appropriation.
[01:33:02.109 --> 01:33:04.010]  Um, I vote that it's a good thing.
[01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:12.432]  That it forged generational peace treaties in the past and that's the only way the different cultures and ethnicities would know what they know about each other today.
[01:33:12.552 --> 01:33:14.593]  That's what the melting pot is, exactly.
[01:33:14.873 --> 01:33:17.874]  And they're saying the melting pot's bad because they don't want us to come together.
[01:33:18.914 --> 01:33:20.474]  And that's the only way we can do it.
[01:33:20.614 --> 01:33:23.715]  If they got friends in high places, we need friends in low places.
[01:33:23.915 --> 01:33:25.496]  And they don't want us to do that, do they?
[01:33:27.216 --> 01:33:28.096]  That's beautiful, brother.
[01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:29.697]  What else is on your mind?
[01:33:31.181 --> 01:33:33.204]  Well, oh, I saw it on the news.
[01:33:33.224 --> 01:33:34.505]  I haven't heard it from y'all today.
[01:33:35.447 --> 01:33:38.389]  Some Russian ships apparently acquired Ukrainian grain.
[01:33:38.369 --> 01:33:41.969]   They've been shipping it around, but they've been denied port to port to port.
[01:33:41.969 --> 01:33:43.969]  I did see that and under effect.
[01:33:43.969 --> 01:33:44.969]  I sent you guys a video.
[01:33:44.969 --> 01:33:48.849]   I forgot to ask for it on the list in China and all over the world.
[01:33:48.849 --> 01:33:50.369]  A caller called in about the share space.
[01:33:50.369 --> 01:33:51.369]  So I looked it up.
[01:33:51.369 --> 01:33:53.208]  I mean, I'd seen it, but it was a big deal.
[01:33:53.208 --> 01:33:54.568]  I should have made a big deal about it.
[01:33:54.568 --> 01:33:58.928]   Did you know they're blocking African food because Africa produces a lot Latin American
[01:33:58.928 --> 01:34:00.809]  food and a bunch of others.
[01:34:00.809 --> 01:34:03.269]  And as you said, claiming it has covid.
[01:34:03.269 --> 01:34:07.248]  So they test the lettuce, which is a false test.
[01:34:07.387 --> 01:34:14.387]   It's like the Zimbabwe president, remember he tested a donkey and three different fruits,
[01:34:14.387 --> 01:34:19.268]   papaya and some other fruit and then like a vegetable and they all came up false positive.
[01:34:19.268 --> 01:34:22.226]  They're blocking food shipments claiming it has COVID.
[01:34:22.226 --> 01:34:24.867]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:34:24.867 --> 01:34:28.827]  Well, it probably won't last much longer.
[01:34:28.827 --> 01:34:33.347]  I'm pretty sure most people are tired of it.
[01:34:33.931 --> 01:34:34.811]  God bless you, Daniel.
[01:34:35.071 --> 01:34:35.912]  Yeah, let's roll this.
[01:34:35.972 --> 01:34:42.833]  This is, uh, I think this is Chinese, but I've got the news articles where China's testing the food and won't feed people and saying it has COVID.
[01:34:42.873 --> 01:34:43.573]  I mean, what?
[01:34:44.053 --> 01:34:45.694]  A virus dies in seconds in the sun.
[01:34:45.954 --> 01:34:48.654]  The damn head of lettuce don't have COVID.
[01:34:49.334 --> 01:34:54.415]  But I mean, it's all about shutting everything down.
[01:34:54.695 --> 01:34:55.535]  You'll have nothing.
[01:34:55.555 --> 01:34:56.296]  You'll own nothing.
[01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:56.916]  They told you.
[01:34:56.936 --> 01:34:58.536]  Go ahead and go ahead and play with audio.
[01:34:58.355 --> 01:34:59.355]  Here it is.
[01:34:59.355 --> 01:35:00.355]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[01:35:00.355 --> 01:35:01.355]  [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:35:01.355 --> 01:35:02.355]  [END PLAYBACK]
[01:35:02.355 --> 01:35:14.595]   He's in his-- for radio listeners, he's in his stupid hazmat suit.
[01:35:15.008 --> 01:35:16.909]  He's got a communist armband on.
[01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:19.770]  And he's testing a head of lettuce.
[01:35:20.430 --> 01:35:22.371]  He's got a cucumber there he's gonna test as well.
[01:35:23.571 --> 01:35:24.472]  And, and celery.
[01:35:24.492 --> 01:35:25.232]  There's nothing more evil.
[01:35:27.873 --> 01:35:30.514]  And he goes, oh my gosh, it's, it's COVID positive!
[01:35:32.289 --> 01:35:34.850]  Again, COVID's real, folks, but it's not your last.
[01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:36.289]  [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:35:36.289 --> 01:35:37.769]  [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:35:37.769 --> 01:35:42.649]  [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:35:42.649 --> 01:35:48.208]   This is all a political hysteria to distract you from what the globalists are doing.
[01:35:47.899 --> 01:35:50.500]  And to bring in the medical ID and tracking everything you do.
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:51.180]  That's all this is.
[01:35:53.301 --> 01:35:53.682]  Oh, look!
[01:35:53.882 --> 01:35:55.963]  The head of lettuce is positive for COVID.
[01:35:56.886 --> 01:36:00.349]  You can't trust anybody but the government and the big corporations that are raping you.
[01:36:00.369 --> 01:36:03.751]  You can't have children, they can't.
[01:36:04.432 --> 01:36:08.314]  You can't fly on a private... public plane, they can fly private.
[01:36:09.976 --> 01:36:12.097]  And next he moves on to the evil zucchini.
[01:36:15.139 --> 01:36:17.201]  Yeah, Tanzanian president, they killed him right after this.
[01:36:17.221 --> 01:36:18.662]  He was a medical doctor.
[01:36:20.203 --> 01:36:22.665]  Questions coronavirus kids after animal test.
[01:36:23.165 --> 01:36:23.886]  Goat, sheep...
[01:36:25.651 --> 01:36:27.371]  A bunch of fruits and vegetables.
[01:36:27.391 --> 01:36:28.432]  They all came up positive.
[01:36:28.792 --> 01:36:30.212]  It's all BS.
[01:36:30.692 --> 01:36:35.073]  Africa has the lowest COVID death rate because they won't take the shots.
[01:36:36.353 --> 01:36:40.994]  Meanwhile, in China, they are in full martial law, but they don't wear military uniforms.
[01:36:41.494 --> 01:36:43.815]  They wear the white bunny suits.
[01:36:46.095 --> 01:36:47.936]  Unbelievable garbage.
[01:36:49.496 --> 01:36:51.316]  Okay, taking calls in order to receive.
[01:36:51.717 --> 01:36:52.997]  Kevin in Pennsylvania.
[01:36:53.017 --> 01:36:53.577]  Welcome, Kevin.
[01:36:54.517 --> 01:36:54.857]  Hello?
[01:36:55.398 --> 01:36:55.958]  Can you hear me?
[01:36:56.139 --> 01:36:56.679]  I can, brother.
[01:36:56.719 --> 01:36:57.720]  Go ahead.
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:59.162]  Hey, man.
[01:36:59.702 --> 01:37:01.684]  Man, I love you, man.
[01:37:01.924 --> 01:37:03.306]  You're everything, man.
[01:37:03.426 --> 01:37:04.647]  I listen to you every day.
[01:37:05.488 --> 01:37:14.048]   First of all, I'd like to say I listen to your show by 605-475-5800 every day.
[01:37:14.048 --> 01:37:18.448]  I get on there and I listen when you come out.
[01:37:18.676 --> 01:37:20.958]  Verizon blocked my call from the cell phone.
[01:37:21.518 --> 01:37:26.103]  I'm hiking the Appalachian Trail and I'm at Equality Inn right at the moment.
[01:37:26.724 --> 01:37:28.946]  When you prayed earlier, that was awesome.
[01:37:30.268 --> 01:37:37.493]  And, uh, the globalists and these guys that are trying to kill us all, they... Remember, they got the scorched earth.
[01:37:38.014 --> 01:37:39.875]  They ain't got no one to answer to now.
[01:37:40.455 --> 01:37:42.957]  Once they take us out, they got no one to answer to.
[01:37:44.118 --> 01:37:45.699]  I don't put anything beyond them.
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:50.142]  My mother tried to wake me up a long time ago, and it was you, man.
[01:37:50.363 --> 01:37:51.083]  And the A.I.
[01:37:53.024 --> 01:37:53.845]  And Joe Biggs.
[01:37:54.826 --> 01:38:01.351]   They, uh... January 6th, Ashley Barrett, Joe Biggs, They need to let these people out.
[01:38:01.651 --> 01:38:02.492]  They need to release them.
[01:38:03.252 --> 01:38:07.317]  And, uh, I can't believe that this has went on like this.
[01:38:08.499 --> 01:38:08.879]  You're right.
[01:38:08.899 --> 01:38:09.960]  They're political prisoners.
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:14.201]  And if we don't stand up to people like Joe Biggs, we are all going to be Joe Biggs.
[01:38:14.621 --> 01:38:17.662]  We're all going to be people like Stewart Rhodes, who they totally set up.
[01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:18.663]  I don't believe anything they say.
[01:38:18.683 --> 01:38:21.644]  Because in filings against us, they just tell total lies.
[01:38:22.064 --> 01:38:23.605]  They say, Owen attacked the Capitol.
[01:38:23.705 --> 01:38:24.985]  Owen doesn't work at Infowars.
[01:38:25.305 --> 01:38:26.026]  He's indicted.
[01:38:26.046 --> 01:38:30.127]  I don't believe a damn thing they say, Kevin.
[01:38:30.807 --> 01:38:31.307]  Exactly.
[01:38:33.652 --> 01:38:34.513]  I know two people.
[01:38:34.953 --> 01:38:43.436]  I'm in Pennsylvania, the voter fraud capital of the world, but I'm from West Tennessee.
[01:38:44.777 --> 01:38:49.538]  I know two people who got the shot exactly 14 days later.
[01:38:49.558 --> 01:38:51.019]  They had heart attacks.
[01:38:51.039 --> 01:38:51.839]  They're still alive.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.320]  I know another guy.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.741]  He's a bodybuilder.
[01:38:56.428 --> 01:39:00.330]  He took the shot, two weeks later he dropped dead.
[01:39:00.650 --> 01:39:08.573]  I'm not ready, I can't release this now, but let's say there's the top five bodybuilders in history.
[01:39:09.394 --> 01:39:13.255]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Zane, those names are up there.
[01:39:14.356 --> 01:39:19.378]  But it's a younger, now he's not young, but he came after them, but he's the top guy.
[01:39:21.779 --> 01:39:22.960]  I said his name, everybody would know it.
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:25.721]  He took, well I'm not going to say anymore.
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.581]  He's a medical doctor.
[01:39:31.582 --> 01:39:34.604]  He took the second Pfizer shot and has blood clots for six months.
[01:39:35.464 --> 01:39:37.165]  And his legs have atrophied and he might die.
[01:39:41.688 --> 01:39:42.669]  That's what we're talking about here.
[01:39:43.409 --> 01:39:44.090]  Thank you, brother.
[01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:44.650]  Appreciate your call.
[01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:45.931]  This is not a joke.
[01:39:47.892 --> 01:39:48.773]  Because I know this person.
[01:39:52.896 --> 01:39:54.497]  I was out in California with him a couple months ago.
[01:39:55.497 --> 01:39:56.458]  And he was already sick from it.
[01:39:59.278 --> 01:39:59.719]  But he did it.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:01.621]  He's a tough guy.
[01:40:01.661 --> 01:40:02.141]  He can take it.
[01:40:04.003 --> 01:40:06.126]  He wanted to be able to go to all the events at the Arnold Classic.
[01:40:08.228 --> 01:40:09.730]  And now he might have to get his legs cut off.
[01:40:11.552 --> 01:40:12.293]  This isn't a game.
[01:40:12.993 --> 01:40:13.654]  We're gonna go to break?
[01:40:14.916 --> 01:40:15.276]  Dylan!
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.020]  And Lee!
[01:40:20.299 --> 01:40:22.421]  And Brandon and Chad and Molto Meal.
[01:40:23.081 --> 01:40:31.087]  And we're gonna continue to call so we can open the phones back up and we'll take more of your calls at 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:40:31.447 --> 01:40:34.209]  The crew knows to put like 20 calls on the board and then just stop there.
[01:40:34.749 --> 01:40:37.091]  We're gonna have time to get to more people, more of your calls.
[01:40:37.111 --> 01:40:38.972]  We'll take a few more after that as well.
[01:40:40.573 --> 01:40:46.447]   But yeah, I mean, they've had a 50,000% was the number I saw.
[01:40:46.867 --> 01:40:53.810]  Increase in heart attacks and microcarditis, heart swelling in football players and soccer players and basketball players and just everybody.
[01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:57.451]  It creates blood clots in the body.
[01:40:57.471 --> 01:41:05.374]  And remember, Pfizer pulled out of a deal with India after India wanted to get vaccine independently medically checked.
[01:41:07.236 --> 01:41:11.618]  Meanwhile, kindergartners are being given assignments as the mainstream news to masturbate at home.
[01:41:12.098 --> 01:41:14.239]  This disgusting madness has to stop.
[01:41:15.139 --> 01:41:17.800]  Calvin Klein hires pregnant man for new campaign.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.261]  Well, won't be buying any Calvin Klein.
[01:41:21.862 --> 01:41:25.983]  I mean, it's just full-on assault on reality because they're selling his tyranny.
[01:41:26.523 --> 01:41:27.164]  We'll be right back.
[01:41:27.184 --> 01:41:27.604]  Stay with us.
[01:41:29.156 --> 01:41:30.557]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[01:41:30.717 --> 01:41:37.621]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[01:41:37.861 --> 01:41:48.588]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[01:41:48.948 --> 01:41:49.849]  There's another thing.
[01:41:50.249 --> 01:41:50.749]  Germs.
[01:41:51.169 --> 01:41:54.531]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from in this country?
[01:41:54.571 --> 01:41:55.332]  Have you noticed this?
[01:41:55.672 --> 01:42:13.280]  The media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections, salmonella, E. coli, hantavirus, bird flu, and Americans, they panic easily, so now everybody's running around, scrubbing this and spraying that, and overcooking their food, and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.601]  It's ridiculous, and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[01:42:17.081 --> 01:42:18.102]  Fear it, germs!
[01:42:18.182 --> 01:42:20.303]  Why, these fucking p***ies!
[01:42:22.148 --> 01:42:23.349]  Where's your sense of adventure?
[01:42:23.409 --> 01:42:24.950]  Take a fucking chance, will ya?
[01:42:26.031 --> 01:42:29.174]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[01:42:29.694 --> 01:42:31.095]  It's for killing germs!
[01:42:31.656 --> 01:42:32.737]  But it needs practice.
[01:42:33.057 --> 01:42:34.978]  It needs germs to practice on.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:38.281]  So, so listen.
[01:42:39.802 --> 01:42:40.303]  So listen.
[01:42:42.498 --> 01:42:49.181]  If you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life, then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[01:42:49.421 --> 01:42:56.504]  And never mind ordinary germs, what are you going to do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid sh**?
[01:42:57.225 --> 01:43:01.025]   I'll tell you what you're gonna do, you're gonna get sick, you're gonna die, and you're gonna deserve it,
[01:43:01.025 --> 01:43:04.225]   'cause you're f***ing weak, and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[01:43:04.225 --> 01:43:06.225]  [laughter]
[01:43:06.225 --> 01:43:10.725]  [applause]
[01:43:10.725 --> 01:43:14.225]  Let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[01:43:14.343 --> 01:43:19.223]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River.
[01:43:19.523 --> 01:43:21.544]  And it was filled with raw sewage.
[01:43:21.824 --> 01:43:22.204]  Okay?
[01:43:22.724 --> 01:43:24.504]  We swam in raw sewage.
[01:43:24.964 --> 01:43:26.225]  You know, to cool off.
[01:43:28.465 --> 01:43:30.605]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[01:43:30.805 --> 01:43:32.986]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:33.766]  But you know something?
[01:43:33.946 --> 01:43:36.066]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[01:43:36.186 --> 01:43:36.686]  No one.
[01:43:36.886 --> 01:43:37.126]  Ever.
[01:43:37.366 --> 01:43:37.927]  You know why?
[01:43:37.947 --> 01:43:40.107]  Because we swam in raw sewage.
[01:43:42.233 --> 01:43:43.794]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[01:43:44.134 --> 01:43:45.655]  The polio never had a prayer.
[01:43:45.715 --> 01:43:47.476]  We were tempered in raw shit.
[01:43:47.496 --> 01:43:53.179]  Studies show that natural immunity is in that human affluence.
[01:43:53.619 --> 01:43:58.401]  Alright, we're going to go back to your phone calls.
[01:43:58.421 --> 01:44:01.503]  I want to show you a picture of my daughter that's five now.
[01:44:02.303 --> 01:44:04.505]  This is such an archetypal photo of her, TV viewer.
[01:44:05.745 --> 01:44:10.588]  This is a photo of my daughter, was two years old, at the duck park feeding ducks.
[01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:12.831]  And she's on my shoulders.
[01:44:14.932 --> 01:44:19.776]  And it's just so archetypal that I'm in bliss and grounded, looking at the ground.
[01:44:20.517 --> 01:44:26.821]  And then she's on my shoulders, the future, looking up at infinity and smiling for that future.
[01:44:27.362 --> 01:44:29.383]  This image counters all their Satanism.
[01:44:30.204 --> 01:44:31.545]  This is one they didn't get to kill.
[01:44:31.565 --> 01:44:33.426]  This is one they didn't get.
[01:44:33.446 --> 01:44:36.969]  And that's why they don't want you to have children.
[01:44:37.950 --> 01:44:47.294]  Because the strength you get from knowing you're taking care of somebody, and completing that mission of your ancestors that had you, and now you're deciding you're part of it, and you're going forward!
[01:44:48.855 --> 01:44:50.016]  I saw the light!
[01:44:51.536 --> 01:44:54.318]  I've been baptized by the fire in your eyes!
[01:44:56.639 --> 01:44:57.919]  Satanists don't have the flame.
[01:44:59.060 --> 01:44:59.940]  We have the flame.
[01:45:01.021 --> 01:45:02.421]  I see our listeners all the time.
[01:45:04.082 --> 01:45:04.963]  I shake your head.
[01:45:06.192 --> 01:45:09.574]  Whether you're black, white, old, young, I see that fire in your eye.
[01:45:12.436 --> 01:45:13.017]  It's beautiful.
[01:45:14.678 --> 01:45:15.358]  Makes me cry.
[01:45:18.761 --> 01:45:20.001]  Born to love again.
[01:45:20.942 --> 01:45:22.303]  I'm a brand new man.
[01:45:24.344 --> 01:45:25.285]  They'll never stop us.
[01:45:26.866 --> 01:45:28.307]  Let's jam another call right now.
[01:45:28.327 --> 01:45:30.349]  Let's talk to Dylan in Arizona.
[01:45:30.369 --> 01:45:30.989]  You're on the air.
[01:45:31.029 --> 01:45:31.369]  Welcome.
[01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:33.531]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:33.591 --> 01:45:34.131]  Can you hear me?
[01:45:34.311 --> 01:45:34.892]  I love you, brother.
[01:45:34.932 --> 01:45:35.212]  Go ahead.
[01:45:36.425 --> 01:45:37.206]  How are you doing today?
[01:45:37.626 --> 01:45:38.486]  I'm on fire, brother.
[01:45:39.747 --> 01:45:39.988]  Good.
[01:45:40.088 --> 01:45:42.229]  Yeah, I'm a longtime fan of the show.
[01:45:42.249 --> 01:45:48.414]  I wanted to call in and talk about the crackpunch that Biden has been handing out.
[01:45:48.734 --> 01:45:52.096]  Which is public, in the bill, going on for six months, but they say it doesn't exist.
[01:45:53.597 --> 01:46:06.835]   You know, I kind of, you know, I wanted to present a different point of view here for you, which is that You know, I think some of it is probably a little bit of a good thing.
[01:46:07.175 --> 01:46:09.518]  Now, let me explain, right?
[01:46:10.219 --> 01:46:20.489]  You can go on about the war on the drugs and all that are happening, but I do think, you know, maybe given some of these people, right?
[01:46:20.509 --> 01:46:24.093]  Because we can't, you know, we can't stop them from doing crack, right?
[01:46:25.478 --> 01:46:30.000]  Giving them some resources to help keep themselves clean, right?
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:32.401]  Or things that they can use to chew up.
[01:46:32.441 --> 01:46:34.582]  No, no, I get needles so you don't get HIV.
[01:46:34.642 --> 01:46:35.923]  You don't need new crack pipes.
[01:46:35.983 --> 01:46:36.803]  It encourages it.
[01:46:37.103 --> 01:46:37.983]  It normalizes it.
[01:46:38.003 --> 01:46:41.085]  The CIA put out how to make it.
[01:46:41.305 --> 01:46:43.206]  I've thought this out.
[01:46:43.246 --> 01:46:44.246]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[01:46:44.646 --> 01:46:46.847]  I'm just telling you, brother, that it's a fraud.
[01:46:47.408 --> 01:46:49.529]  How do you put somebody in jail for 10 years for crack?
[01:46:49.549 --> 01:46:50.229]  Give them crack pipes.
[01:46:52.245 --> 01:46:53.286]  No, I agree with you.
[01:46:53.547 --> 01:46:55.368]  They shouldn't be putting people in jail for it.
[01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:56.449]  They should be helping.
[01:46:57.350 --> 01:47:01.514]  But I think, you know, the people on the ground, they can't really do those things, right?
[01:47:01.534 --> 01:47:02.816]  They just have the crackpots.
[01:47:03.356 --> 01:47:06.620]  Or, you know, the resources to help keep themselves safe, at least.
[01:47:07.220 --> 01:47:07.460]  You know?
[01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:13.787]  Nothing coming out of the Biden administration is to help people.
[01:47:15.561 --> 01:47:17.603]  And, but I understand what you're saying.
[01:47:17.623 --> 01:47:20.245]  You think it's part of the decriminalization movement.
[01:47:20.285 --> 01:47:20.785]  That's a trick.
[01:47:20.945 --> 01:47:23.387]  Why do you think Soros wants everybody to smoke marijuana?
[01:47:23.427 --> 01:47:28.931]  I don't want to put you in jail for it, but the modern marijuana, a lot of the strains will brain damage you and give you schizophrenia.
[01:47:29.251 --> 01:47:29.832]  That's on record.
[01:47:30.512 --> 01:47:32.494]  So it's, it's a complex issue.
[01:47:32.814 --> 01:47:36.317]  The point is they're lying and saying they're not shipping out the crack pipes.
[01:47:36.337 --> 01:47:37.397]  Do you understand that my point?
[01:47:39.339 --> 01:47:40.179]  Oh yeah, maybe.
[01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:46.343]   Oh, you're saying that they're, they're, Oh, you're saying they're shipping out the crack pipes themselves?
[01:47:46.964 --> 01:47:50.545]  The federal government paid to have crack pipe kits put together.
[01:47:50.565 --> 01:47:51.426]  I showed all the documents.
[01:47:51.706 --> 01:47:53.907]  They admit they did, and now Psaki says they're not.
[01:47:54.367 --> 01:47:55.628]  So it's the lying about it.
[01:47:57.129 --> 01:47:57.269]  Oh.
[01:47:57.509 --> 01:47:58.949]  Yeah, I don't know why they don't just admit to it.
[01:47:59.770 --> 01:48:01.871]  Because they're a lying pack of enemies.
[01:48:02.071 --> 01:48:02.731]  God bless you.
[01:48:04.052 --> 01:48:05.533]  Because they don't like the truth.
[01:48:05.913 --> 01:48:07.013]  Because they live a lie.
[01:48:06.853 --> 01:48:22.432]   their delusional filth listen to those angels play (snoring)
[01:48:22.432 --> 01:48:24.432]  (sighs)
[01:48:25.099 --> 01:48:27.721]  Like a tree to the sun, taking the life in victory.
[01:48:31.843 --> 01:48:33.164]  I saw the light.
[01:48:36.126 --> 01:48:37.907]  I saw the light.
[01:48:42.429 --> 01:48:43.710]  That's what this broadcast is all about.
[01:48:44.949 --> 01:48:48.071]  If you don't believe in God, it's about seeing the light and knowing what's going on.
[01:48:48.091 --> 01:48:55.815]  And once you see the light, once you take the red pill, there ain't no going back.
[01:48:58.677 --> 01:49:02.379]  Yeah, we've got the House Majority Leader saying we are now at war with Russia.
[01:49:02.979 --> 01:49:04.220]  We are now in a war with Russia.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.220]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:49:05.801 --> 01:49:07.842]  But right now, let's go to Lee in Canada.
[01:49:07.902 --> 01:49:09.183]  Lee, thanks for holding here on the air.
[01:49:09.203 --> 01:49:10.904]  Talk about your Deputy Prime Minister.
[01:49:10.944 --> 01:49:11.244]  Go ahead.
[01:49:12.932 --> 01:49:14.032]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:49:14.313 --> 01:49:15.193]  I'm here with you, brother.
[01:49:15.233 --> 01:49:15.593]  I'm good.
[01:49:16.874 --> 01:49:17.214]  Awesome.
[01:49:17.274 --> 01:49:18.414]  Thanks for being a warrior.
[01:49:18.675 --> 01:49:19.895]  Thanks for speaking the truth.
[01:49:20.015 --> 01:49:20.795]  We appreciate it.
[01:49:20.815 --> 01:49:21.436]  Appreciate you.
[01:49:22.876 --> 01:49:27.538]  You ever scratch your head and wonder what the hell's going on in Canada and how the hell it's happening?
[01:49:29.879 --> 01:49:32.160]  It's New World Order, Davos Group takeover, yeah.
[01:49:33.261 --> 01:49:38.983]  Well, here's a little background information on Christian Freeland, our Deputy Prime Minister.
[01:49:39.143 --> 01:49:42.245]  Yeah, the Bilderberg Group alumni of Davos Group, yeah.
[01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:44.531]  Yeah, and a little bit more.
[01:49:44.771 --> 01:49:47.152]  So she was born in Northern Alberta.
[01:49:47.952 --> 01:49:50.254]  When she was in grade four, her parents divorced.
[01:49:50.374 --> 01:49:53.435]  She moved to Edmonton with her mom and her siblings.
[01:49:54.196 --> 01:49:56.537]  And she was kind of taken in by her grandfather.
[01:49:57.457 --> 01:50:03.501]  And in an interview in 2017, she discussed how in his house, she became very close to him.
[01:50:04.041 --> 01:50:07.663]  And there were pictures of Karl Marx and writings of Karl Marx on the wall.
[01:50:08.903 --> 01:50:11.785]  Her grandfather's name is Mikhail Chomiak.
[01:50:12.648 --> 01:50:23.854]  Mikhail Chomiak, pre-World War II and during World War II, ran Nazi propaganda newspapers in Poland and the Ukraine.
[01:50:24.434 --> 01:50:26.115]  And I'm not, I'm not raining on your parade.
[01:50:27.276 --> 01:50:28.356]  You're right, we've covered this.
[01:50:28.376 --> 01:50:29.137]  This is all true.
[01:50:29.577 --> 01:50:32.798]  He didn't just run them, he was like the adjunct to Joseph Goebbels.
[01:50:34.279 --> 01:50:36.200]  Ah, I did not know that.
[01:50:38.101 --> 01:50:44.384]   So after that, he was educated at Harvard, became a journalist, And well, she was a journalist.
[01:50:44.464 --> 01:50:48.005]  She traveled for about a year around the world with George Soros.
[01:50:50.786 --> 01:50:51.967]  Yep, that's who she is.
[01:50:52.087 --> 01:50:52.647]  Absolutely.
[01:50:52.687 --> 01:50:54.048]  And that's who really runs your country.
[01:50:54.448 --> 01:50:55.168]  It's unbelievable.
[01:50:56.369 --> 01:51:03.391]  And a little bit of mainstream media.
[01:51:03.411 --> 01:51:12.195]  In 1991, he was a high school drama teacher, or sorry, 1999, high school drama teacher in Port Coquitlam, BC, British Columbia.
[01:51:13.349 --> 01:51:18.274]  He was arrested and charged for molesting one of his students, his young female student.
[01:51:18.854 --> 01:51:20.015]  Your phone's breaking up.
[01:51:20.075 --> 01:51:20.515]  Who was?
[01:51:20.656 --> 01:51:21.036]  Who was?
[01:51:22.357 --> 01:51:23.438]  Justin Trudeau.
[01:51:23.918 --> 01:51:24.179]  Wow.
[01:51:24.419 --> 01:51:26.461]  Justin Trudeau was charged in 99.
[01:51:26.521 --> 01:51:27.642]  He had a trial by jury.
[01:51:27.662 --> 01:51:29.944]  Oh, I remember the story how they paid him off and covered it up.
[01:51:29.964 --> 01:51:35.929]  Paid him off and covered it up and now the trial documents are sealed.
[01:51:36.431 --> 01:51:37.352]  Well, that's who they want.
[01:51:37.392 --> 01:51:38.512]  They want compromised people.
[01:51:38.552 --> 01:51:39.493]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:51:39.513 --> 01:51:40.153]  Powerful, Lee.
[01:51:40.233 --> 01:51:40.713]  All true.
[01:51:41.514 --> 01:51:42.755]  We forget all this stuff.
[01:51:42.795 --> 01:51:43.475]  It's all on record.
[01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:48.738]  Let's go ahead now and let's talk to Brandon in Michigan.
[01:51:48.778 --> 01:51:49.439]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[01:51:49.479 --> 01:51:49.759]  Welcome.
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:52.240]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.261]  How's it going today, man?
[01:51:53.361 --> 01:51:54.281]  Good talking to you, brother.
[01:51:54.361 --> 01:51:56.222]  Good to be on the air in defiance of all their tyranny.
[01:51:56.242 --> 01:51:57.363]  It means they haven't won yet.
[01:51:58.744 --> 01:52:00.825]  Yeah, and that's definitely the truth.
[01:52:01.786 --> 01:52:08.682]   I just wanted to call in because, you know, I want to talk a little bit about how we need to get out of this.
[01:52:10.244 --> 01:52:19.930]  We focus a lot about what's going on and trying to fight it, and I think that's probably the right thing to do, but I think we also need to be able to boil it down and recognize what's real.
[01:52:20.731 --> 01:52:24.513]  And at this point, these people are going for broke.
[01:52:25.134 --> 01:52:26.134]  They're not going to stop.
[01:52:26.755 --> 01:52:40.335]   Whatever they want out of it, whether it's depopulation or You know, just control and power and being able to control us as slaves, whatever it is, we need to recognize that's the goal and they're going for it.
[01:52:41.275 --> 01:52:47.039]  And we need to distance ourselves from that and just, you know, they want to play their games.
[01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:49.201]  Well, why don't we just start playing our own?
[01:52:49.741 --> 01:52:53.504]  And we gotta, you know, we're all stuck in this corporate world.
[01:52:54.204 --> 01:53:10.536]   Everybody's working a nine to five, Brooke, trying to, uh, Just get by and we need to start taking the extra time that we have after our jobs and start talking to each other and we need to start working on things, side projects, and get ourselves out of it.
[01:53:11.397 --> 01:53:12.597]  I think that's our only option.
[01:53:12.798 --> 01:53:13.118]  You're right.
[01:53:13.158 --> 01:53:14.479]  We have to build the new world.
[01:53:14.539 --> 01:53:16.060]  We're in the world, but not of it.
[01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:23.725]  We have to recognize that everything they're doing is assaulting us and only support grassroots and mom and pops and independents and realize we're under attack.
[01:53:23.745 --> 01:53:33.633]   We didn't ask for this fight, but they started it and as I've said a thousand times, I don't know how all this is going to end, but if they want to fight, they better believe they've got one, brother.
[01:53:33.773 --> 01:53:36.055]  And that is exactly where we are.
[01:53:36.095 --> 01:53:40.338]  We have to recognize that, not as victims, but as overcomers.
[01:53:40.398 --> 01:53:44.501]  And that's basically the whole slogan and everything InfoWars stands for.
[01:53:44.802 --> 01:53:45.983]  And that's who we are.
[01:53:47.509 --> 01:53:47.729]  Yeah.
[01:53:48.109 --> 01:53:48.590]  Yeah.
[01:53:48.670 --> 01:53:49.130]  And you do it.
[01:53:49.210 --> 01:53:50.391]  You really do a great job.
[01:53:50.431 --> 01:53:51.972]  And I just wanted to say one more thing.
[01:53:52.913 --> 01:53:59.478]  You're one of the only people that I hear that really boiled down like how simple this actually is with these people.
[01:53:59.498 --> 01:54:00.879]  They're not stupid people.
[01:54:01.359 --> 01:54:02.240]  These people are not.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:02.820]  They're not.
[01:54:03.160 --> 01:54:03.721]  They're not dumb.
[01:54:03.801 --> 01:54:04.801]  They're intelligent people.
[01:54:05.382 --> 01:54:11.266]  And once everybody realizes these people aren't stupid, the goal for their job is just different.
[01:54:12.267 --> 01:54:14.849]  And it really it really makes them wonder.
[01:54:15.009 --> 01:54:17.368]   And that's That's what we need to do.
[01:54:17.428 --> 01:54:18.869]  We need to get people to think about that.
[01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:20.149]  Well, that's right.
[01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:25.852]  Once you realize it's a predatory worldview, where they've given up on God, they've joined with evil, then it all makes sense.
[01:54:25.892 --> 01:54:27.192]  And their own writings admit that.
[01:54:27.492 --> 01:54:30.893]  The Dabos Group, no more free will, getting rid of your family, getting rid of humans.
[01:54:31.254 --> 01:54:32.594]  This is psychotic.
[01:54:32.654 --> 01:54:35.395]  These people are the worst people on earth.
[01:54:35.415 --> 01:54:36.435]  They're beyond creepy.
[01:54:36.455 --> 01:54:38.376]  They are bad news, brother.
[01:54:38.396 --> 01:54:40.297]  I agree.
[01:54:40.477 --> 01:54:40.797]  I agree.
[01:54:40.837 --> 01:54:42.098]  Well, you're doing a great job.
[01:54:42.158 --> 01:54:45.659]  And everybody here in Michigan, if we can, we try to do what we can.
[01:54:46.491 --> 01:54:49.633]  But everybody work together and talk to each other.
[01:54:49.773 --> 01:54:50.113]  That's right.
[01:54:50.153 --> 01:54:50.693]  Beautifully said.
[01:54:50.733 --> 01:54:51.173]  Thank you, sir.
[01:54:52.474 --> 01:54:52.874]  All right.
[01:54:53.515 --> 01:54:57.276]  Let's go ahead and take another call as we go to break in three minutes, two and a half minutes.
[01:54:57.717 --> 01:54:59.478]  Malto Meal in Wisconsin.
[01:54:59.518 --> 01:55:00.098]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:01.570 --> 01:55:02.870]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:02.990 --> 01:55:11.412]  I'm a massive fan, and I want to talk about some wild conspiracy theories and rabbit holes with the milk infant formula issue.
[01:55:12.112 --> 01:55:18.373]  I was wondering if you remember the 2008 Chinese melamine crisis.
[01:55:18.413 --> 01:55:20.714]  Melamine, plastic in the baby formula, yeah.
[01:55:20.754 --> 01:55:22.994]  Yes, I need to remember your memories, Bulletproof.
[01:55:23.114 --> 01:55:24.295]  I love you so much for that.
[01:55:24.335 --> 01:55:31.276]  Yeah, and since then, there's been a huge distrust of domestic, for Chinese people, formula.
[01:55:32.052 --> 01:55:33.573]  And they import a lot of formula.
[01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:40.699]  And if you look at the numbers, I follow the numbers because, you know, I did like import export inventions here in Wisconsin and we're a dairy state of multiverse.
[01:55:41.479 --> 01:55:51.807]  And, you know, like they have the import numbers were peaking to like three hundred thirty three tons, a thousand tons before coronavirus then started going down a bit.
[01:55:52.528 --> 01:55:59.413]  And I think the infant formulas relate in the US is related to the Shanghai and Chinese lockdown.
[01:56:00.349 --> 01:56:11.056]  Yeah, it's getting shipped here and then relabeled as American or German.
[01:56:11.456 --> 01:56:12.397]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:12.457 --> 01:56:16.259]  I think that's actually been in the news, buried in some of the trade publications I saw a few days ago.
[01:56:16.659 --> 01:56:17.740]  So you're totally on target.
[01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:19.621]  Obviously, that's what you do for a living, so that's why you know.
[01:56:20.161 --> 01:56:21.102]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:56:22.625 --> 01:56:50.061]   Well, I think it's like, uh, I've talked about before, like, uh, the, the, like, Easter Island scenario where, like, you, uh, sabotage a country and pull all the resources slowly, and then, like, everyone's trapped on the island, you know, and then it's like, you know, Mad Max scenario, and then eventually it goes to, like, Hunger Games Society where, like, the, uh, power elite then just comes back in and has, like, you know, Weirder rules and a different tyranny.
[01:56:50.121 --> 01:56:53.802]  An authoritarian takeover to stabilize the crisis they themselves began.
[01:56:54.102 --> 01:56:55.302]  That is their exact words.
[01:56:55.362 --> 01:56:56.383]  That is the Great Reset.
[01:56:56.743 --> 01:56:57.823]  That is what Klaus Schwab is doing.
[01:56:57.863 --> 01:56:58.423]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:58.443 --> 01:56:59.084]  Amazing points.
[01:57:00.924 --> 01:57:05.626]  We're doing something here live on air right now that the controllers don't like.
[01:57:06.226 --> 01:57:07.466]  You're calling a phone number?
[01:57:07.566 --> 01:57:08.106]  You're on air.
[01:57:08.827 --> 01:57:10.227]  You're speaking your mind.
[01:57:10.327 --> 01:57:11.287]  You're unfiltered.
[01:57:11.427 --> 01:57:12.248]  You're not controlled.
[01:57:12.288 --> 01:57:12.668]  You're free.

[01:57:24.335 --> 01:57:25.455]  And I want to just encourage you.

[01:59:04.113 --> 01:59:09.113]   God bless you, Alex. God bless your guests. God bless your crew.
[01:59:09.113 --> 01:59:12.113]  God bless all the InfraWarriors out there. God bless you.
[01:59:12.113 --> 01:59:17.813]   Yeah, I wanted to talk about, you know, something everybody's been asking about,
[01:59:17.813 --> 01:59:21.313]  a global solution that I think everybody can rally behind.
[01:59:21.349 --> 01:59:31.074]  You know, and what made me start to think about this was I thought about what it is about you, Alex, that I adore so much.
[01:59:31.874 --> 01:59:32.634]  And it's your courage.
[01:59:33.315 --> 01:59:36.236]  You've got courage like nobody else I've ever seen.
[01:59:36.256 --> 01:59:40.738]  And I think we need to have more courage.
[01:59:40.978 --> 01:59:42.539]  I need to have more courage.
[01:59:43.433 --> 01:59:50.578]  And that brings me to the point that this idea needs to start at the tip of the spear.
[01:59:51.058 --> 01:59:52.199]  And that's why I'm calling you.
[01:59:52.219 --> 01:59:54.160]  I'm in the belly of the beast.
[01:59:55.041 --> 02:00:02.066]  And what we need to do is we need to pick a day, a day that we could call the people's day.
[02:00:02.827 --> 02:00:09.971]  And it will be a day that we could rally behind the 20% that are all awake.
[02:00:10.572 --> 02:00:12.033]  And it will be the greatest day.
[02:00:12.563 --> 02:00:16.384]  That the 20% are going to wake up the rest of the population.
[02:00:17.444 --> 02:00:25.586]  And on that day, we will email, we will text, we will call, we will do whatever we can to get the word out.
[02:00:25.626 --> 02:00:28.887]  You can call it a wake up day.
[02:00:32.248 --> 02:00:45.013]   But what we need to do is because what's going to happen is the people who are asleep, they're going to get a message from not just you who You know, everybody hears from not just me, but five other people that they trust and they love.
[02:00:45.053 --> 02:00:48.336]  And they're going to go, wow, what is all this information?
[02:00:48.356 --> 02:00:51.759]  Chad, I totally agree with you, but we need to have it every day we wake up, David.
[02:00:51.779 --> 02:00:52.259]  You're right.
[02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:54.801]  Focus on a day, pick a day to start.
[02:00:55.182 --> 02:00:57.063]  And that's how the snowball starts rolling.
[02:00:57.724 --> 02:01:00.166]  And believe me, we've almost beat the globalists together with God's help.
[02:01:01.207 --> 02:01:02.208]  We're so close.
[02:01:02.888 --> 02:01:05.630]  All their censorship, all their brainwashing, all their attacks.
[02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:10.057]  All their surveillance would not be necessary if they were in power.
[02:01:10.137 --> 02:01:10.798]  They are weak.
[02:01:11.138 --> 02:01:12.420]  What they're doing is wrong.
[02:01:14.063 --> 02:01:14.543]  That's right.
[02:01:15.164 --> 02:01:23.784]   And if we did this on the day before school starts, and that way when everybody goes to drop their kids off, Or you pick a day.
[02:01:23.844 --> 02:01:24.364]  I think you're right.
[02:01:24.384 --> 02:01:25.945]  I think Sunday is the day we're off.
[02:01:26.526 --> 02:01:35.132]  And Sunday is when we reach out with people of the Ministry of Truth to counter their Ministry of Truth and minister about why they're taking over and what they're doing.
[02:01:35.192 --> 02:01:37.053]  So a ministry of warning people.
[02:01:37.413 --> 02:01:37.954]  Great idea.
[02:01:37.974 --> 02:01:38.754]  Let's codify that.
[02:01:38.794 --> 02:01:39.595]  Let's launch it, Chad.
[02:01:39.615 --> 02:01:39.975]  Thank you.
[02:01:40.475 --> 02:01:40.876]  Amazing.
[02:01:41.276 --> 02:01:42.557]  Julie in Pennsylvania.
[02:01:42.577 --> 02:01:43.317]  Thank you for calling.
[02:01:43.337 --> 02:01:43.918]  Go ahead, Julie.
[02:01:44.963 --> 02:01:47.705]  Hello sir, I just think you're great.
[02:01:47.885 --> 02:01:59.574]  I was just going over the ownership chain of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Abbott Labs who own Enfamil and Similac that was delivered down at the border.
[02:01:59.754 --> 02:02:00.334]  Yes.
[02:02:00.574 --> 02:02:15.927]   I think we need to find out how many pallets it was because if it was 200 pallets, 300 pallets, Your previous caller said that there was a decrease in manufacturing of formula across the board globally.
[02:02:15.987 --> 02:02:17.168]  Yeah, so there's a shortage.
[02:02:17.248 --> 02:02:19.650]  How is the federal government owning so much of it?
[02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:20.651]  It means they've been hoarding it.
[02:02:21.592 --> 02:02:23.834]  So Psaki accuses us of hoarding it.
[02:02:23.854 --> 02:02:26.156]  The American people, everything they do is the inverse.
[02:02:26.196 --> 02:02:26.396]  Yeah.
[02:02:27.429 --> 02:02:34.216]  That's right, and it was a premeditated act, because this is not something that you ordered, like, last week.
[02:02:34.696 --> 02:02:41.904]  They had you planning this for maybe a year, two years even, in order to be able to shave off the global supply.
[02:02:42.344 --> 02:02:45.087]  So what I'm thinking about is, who paid for this?
[02:02:46.719 --> 02:02:47.980]  How did these end up there?
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:49.681]  And who planned this?
[02:02:49.841 --> 02:03:00.210]  Because it had to have been the planning for this and perhaps even the payment for this took place before Biden took control of the government.
[02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.910]  Wow.
[02:03:01.371 --> 02:03:02.712]  Julie, what a smart call.
[02:03:02.972 --> 02:03:03.473]  Absolutely.
[02:03:03.493 --> 02:03:09.317]  That's what we need good members of Congress to be demanding answers from investigating and investigative journalists to be looking at.
[02:03:09.678 --> 02:03:11.179]  You're absolutely right.
[02:03:12.463 --> 02:03:17.866]  The people who own Bristol-Myers Squibb and Abbott Labs are all the same companies.
[02:03:18.146 --> 02:03:20.027]  Vanguard, BlackRock.
[02:03:20.247 --> 02:03:24.130]  It's Abbott Labs with the antigen test for the COVID.
[02:03:25.410 --> 02:03:26.151]  Exactly!
[02:03:26.511 --> 02:03:31.914]  And there's no way that this could have taken place without the big boys being involved.
[02:03:32.154 --> 02:03:40.459]  And this was entirely premeditated, and this was part of the grand plan, and this had to have been planned over a year ago.
[02:03:41.072 --> 02:03:41.833]  Perfectly said.
[02:03:41.873 --> 02:03:43.394]  Thank you so much, Julie, for the call.
[02:03:43.795 --> 02:03:44.515]  We're moving quick.
[02:03:44.555 --> 02:03:45.897]  Everybody, what amazing callers.
[02:03:46.337 --> 02:03:48.039]  So proud of our audience, how smart they are.
[02:03:48.479 --> 02:03:50.241]  Michael in California, you're on the air.
[02:03:50.261 --> 02:03:50.621]  Go ahead.
[02:03:52.002 --> 02:03:52.403]  Hey, Alex.
[02:03:53.083 --> 02:03:53.384]  Yes, sir.
[02:03:53.404 --> 02:03:55.145]  So I've been thinking about your bandwidth costs.
[02:03:55.606 --> 02:03:58.068]  You said you've been spending millions on those.
[02:03:58.188 --> 02:04:04.294]  And I remembered an open source library I use for a project called WebTorrent.
[02:04:05.516 --> 02:04:10.298]  And basically what it does is peer-to-peer file sharing, right?
[02:04:10.418 --> 02:04:12.119]  And so that can go over the browser.
[02:04:12.399 --> 02:04:13.180]  Sure, that's what I mean.
[02:04:13.240 --> 02:04:14.120]  Is that like BitChute?
[02:04:15.921 --> 02:04:16.821]  Yeah, it's like BitChute.
[02:04:16.861 --> 02:04:18.422]  Yeah, it uses WebRTC.
[02:04:19.102 --> 02:04:22.484]  So basically the more people that are watching your videos... No, you're right.
[02:04:22.524 --> 02:04:25.305]  And so things like BitChute don't work if there's not a big audience.
[02:04:25.325 --> 02:04:30.708]  But because we have a big audience, we should move to that because we have the core audience to make it where it'll work.
[02:04:31.008 --> 02:04:31.888]  That's a really good point.
[02:04:31.968 --> 02:04:33.309]  In fact, we've been talking about that.
[02:04:34.423 --> 02:04:36.364]  Yeah, webtorrent.io.
[02:04:38.785 --> 02:04:39.625]  That's the website.
[02:04:40.005 --> 02:04:41.526]  And explain to folks how that works.
[02:04:42.766 --> 02:04:51.890]  Yeah, so right now you have one server with all your files on it, and everyone who goes to your website is accessing that server to get the video files.
[02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:55.892]  And you have to pay for all that outgoing bandwidth, right?
[02:04:55.972 --> 02:05:07.439]   So what this essentially does is it inverts that relationship Where every node, every peer, every person who's accessing that data is accessing it from everyone else while they're watching it.
[02:05:09.454 --> 02:05:13.775]  Well, we got approached a few years ago by BitChute wanting us to buy them, and I just don't have the money.
[02:05:14.475 --> 02:05:17.036]  I mean, I don't have two million dollars extra sitting around.
[02:05:17.356 --> 02:05:18.036]  I'm maxed out.
[02:05:18.596 --> 02:05:24.297]  But yeah, we should probably try to start by every video, have a version that is a torrent system.
[02:05:24.837 --> 02:05:26.778]  We just didn't do it because of the reliability issue.
[02:05:26.798 --> 02:05:31.319]  But I think what the engineers have told me what you're saying is, because we already have such a big core audience.
[02:05:32.159 --> 02:05:41.164]  That's what actually allows that infrastructure to build, and that would make the videos more accessible, because for folks who don't know, sometimes the videos don't work if you use that system.
[02:05:42.725 --> 02:05:48.649]  Yeah, the more people accessing the website and the videos, the faster and more resilient it becomes.
[02:05:53.151 --> 02:05:59.475]  Well, we need to create a bit, I mean, we may have to, because we're just maxed out.
[02:05:59.515 --> 02:06:00.595]  That is a really good idea.
[02:06:00.615 --> 02:06:01.156]  Anything else, sir?
[02:06:02.697 --> 02:06:03.197]  That'll do it.
[02:06:03.237 --> 02:06:03.718]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:06:04.118 --> 02:06:04.638]  Thank you, brother.
[02:06:04.658 --> 02:06:05.359]  All right.
[02:06:06.479 --> 02:06:11.502]  I'm going to go to Mark, Justin, and Ron in this short five-minute segment, and then Pete Santelli's going to take over.
[02:06:11.522 --> 02:06:15.665]  So I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half or so.
[02:06:15.885 --> 02:06:17.386]  Mark, Justin, Ron, love you.
[02:06:17.406 --> 02:06:18.366]  We're going to go to break.
[02:06:18.386 --> 02:06:19.387]  We're going to come back to you.
[02:06:20.566 --> 02:06:29.569]  And then I've not been doing Saturday shows and extra shows and all of a sudden I've been doing so much infrastructure things and dealing with trying to raise money that I'm running around trying to raise money with sponsors and vetting them and then dealing with it.
[02:06:29.829 --> 02:06:30.549]  I'm not complaining.
[02:06:30.949 --> 02:06:34.651]  I would just be on air more if we were not so close to the red.
[02:06:35.131 --> 02:06:36.431]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:06:36.491 --> 02:06:37.551]  Impolwarestore.com.
[02:06:37.972 --> 02:06:40.092]  But whatever you do, support the local A&M affiliates.
[02:06:40.132 --> 02:06:40.953]  Become a sponsor.
[02:06:40.973 --> 02:06:41.753]  Support your sponsors.
[02:06:42.933 --> 02:06:43.673]  Make a donation.
[02:06:43.713 --> 02:06:46.634]  We've gone from 200 and something affiliates to almost 350 in the last year.
[02:06:49.591 --> 02:06:52.255]  And a lot of the stages are taking us from nighttime to live.
[02:06:53.436 --> 02:07:00.846]  Or they even air us like they're in primetime in the morning in drive time because they get how serious it is and their audiences are responding well to the truth.
[02:07:00.886 --> 02:07:02.628]  So people are ready for the truth.
[02:07:03.229 --> 02:07:04.230]  Let's just keep fighting.
[02:07:04.631 --> 02:07:06.573]  This is the main part of the fight, the 12th round.
[02:07:06.593 --> 02:07:07.515]  We're going to do it together.
[02:07:08.923 --> 02:07:15.269]  Spread the articles, spread the videos, pray for the broadcast, pray for Global Awakening and buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:07:15.609 --> 02:07:22.135]  The Globalists want to shut this place down so much, and because of you, we are still standing so I humbly, on my knees, thank you.
[02:07:22.316 --> 02:07:23.036]  I am in your hands.
[02:07:23.597 --> 02:07:25.659]  Hour number four, straight ahead in two minutes.
[02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.203]  And here we are on this Friday the 13th at hour number four.
[02:07:31.024 --> 02:07:33.126]  We're going to talk to a caller in Minnesota, Justin.
[02:07:33.186 --> 02:07:34.447]  Justin, thank you for calling.
[02:07:36.198 --> 02:07:39.540]  Mr. Jones, so I want to make a personal apology to you.
[02:07:40.561 --> 02:07:44.724]  The last two years, we have been involved in a mental war, my friend.
[02:07:45.264 --> 02:07:52.149]  And I've honestly made some bad investments in cars when I could have been investing.
[02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:59.554]  And I've made some investments in the vitamins you have and all that other stuff that obviously keep us alive up to this point, man.
[02:07:59.794 --> 02:08:01.015]  And I thank you for that.
[02:08:01.395 --> 02:08:02.436]  Well, don't apologize to me.
[02:08:02.476 --> 02:08:04.177]  We all have done things that don't work out.
[02:08:06.505 --> 02:08:08.266]  Honestly, that's all I got for you.
[02:08:08.326 --> 02:08:08.666]  Thank you.
[02:08:08.686 --> 02:08:09.166]  All right.
[02:08:09.206 --> 02:08:09.786]  God bless you.
[02:08:10.006 --> 02:08:10.746]  Thanks for the support.
[02:08:11.326 --> 02:08:11.646]  All right.
[02:08:11.706 --> 02:08:14.247]  Let's talk to Mark in Oklahoma.
[02:08:14.287 --> 02:08:14.867]  Mark, welcome.
[02:08:17.308 --> 02:08:17.608]  Alex.
[02:08:18.488 --> 02:08:18.788]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:20.509 --> 02:08:21.289]  How are you today?
[02:08:21.489 --> 02:08:22.549]  Long time listener.
[02:08:22.569 --> 02:08:24.650]  I'm just blessed to be on here talking to you, Mark.
[02:08:24.690 --> 02:08:25.050]  Thank you.
[02:08:26.070 --> 02:08:26.531]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:28.582 --> 02:08:36.944]  Listening earlier and you hear about, you know, the jabs and one person getting hurt, another person maybe dying.
[02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:51.628]  I'm sitting here, I deal with the senior population and so far I am up to 20 different clients that have passed away and nobody seems to be talking about it.
[02:08:51.688 --> 02:08:52.588]  What can I do?
[02:08:52.968 --> 02:08:54.288]  It's a massive population.
[02:08:54.348 --> 02:08:55.288]  It's so sad, brother.
[02:08:55.989 --> 02:08:57.149]  What are you witnessing, Mark?
[02:08:58.907 --> 02:09:08.489]  Uh, the older people, forgetfulness, blood clots, Parkinson's disease.
[02:09:09.070 --> 02:09:10.670]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:09:10.730 --> 02:09:15.771]  And I try to warn people, but yet they're still getting out and going to get these jabs.
[02:09:16.051 --> 02:09:17.472]  I just don't understand.
[02:09:18.132 --> 02:09:19.112]  I just don't get it.
[02:09:19.810 --> 02:09:22.853]  Well, national polls show the majority of Americans are now against the shots.
[02:09:22.893 --> 02:09:25.416]  But yeah, they are really targeting old folks.
[02:09:25.436 --> 02:09:26.658]  And we have statistics.
[02:09:26.678 --> 02:09:27.539]  We know it's killing them.
[02:09:28.039 --> 02:09:29.801]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.024]  So sad.
[02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:34.426]  Yes, for sure.
[02:09:34.486 --> 02:09:36.749]  Just wanted to let everybody know that's happening.
[02:09:37.358 --> 02:09:39.339]  So thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:09:39.419 --> 02:09:40.300]  I do appreciate it.
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:41.841]  Thanks for holding, Mark, to tell people that.
[02:09:42.301 --> 02:09:42.541]  Wow.
[02:09:43.201 --> 02:09:44.442]  Another first-hand account.
[02:09:44.922 --> 02:09:45.983]  Ron in Arizona.
[02:09:46.023 --> 02:09:49.185]  Ron, you're our tail gunner before P. Santilli takes over.
[02:09:49.225 --> 02:09:49.785]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:09:51.406 --> 02:09:52.347]  Well, thank you.
[02:09:52.367 --> 02:09:54.828]  Appreciate the opportunity.
[02:09:55.629 --> 02:10:02.813]  You know, every day I look at my computer, I get up in the middle of the night, I look at what's going on, and I wonder, you know, how did we get here?
[02:10:04.088 --> 02:10:12.812]  I remember when Joe Biden was running for president and when he would say, I'm going to beat Donald Trump, he'd get a standing ovation.
[02:10:13.412 --> 02:10:18.234]  And when he says, you know, Trump, Trump, that's when people would cheer.
[02:10:18.254 --> 02:10:21.116]  You know, he never laid out any plans.
[02:10:21.216 --> 02:10:25.317]  He never laid out any, you know, great ideas.
[02:10:25.477 --> 02:10:30.520]  So, you know, what we have is what we selected as a country, you know?
[02:10:32.091 --> 02:10:35.033]  Is it going to take three years for this to go away, Alex?
[02:10:36.074 --> 02:10:40.337]  You know, we let Joe Biden steal the election.
[02:10:40.357 --> 02:10:41.998]  I think evidence is overwhelming that that happened.
[02:10:42.818 --> 02:10:46.180]  But there's the argument of, well, he makes it so bad for the left, leave him in.
[02:10:46.501 --> 02:10:47.882]  He'll wreck the country before then.
[02:10:47.922 --> 02:10:48.402]  They know that.
[02:10:48.782 --> 02:10:54.666]  What do you think of the plan to try to impeach him or have the impeachment as a way to expose, cutting off the energy, opening the borders?
[02:10:54.726 --> 02:10:55.827]  I mean, do you agree with me on that?
[02:10:58.075 --> 02:11:01.836]  Well, it's definitely a process that's available whether or not they'll act on it.
[02:11:01.976 --> 02:11:03.156]  It's anybody's guess.
[02:11:04.616 --> 02:11:05.837]  Well, you sound like a smart guy.
[02:11:05.857 --> 02:11:07.057]  Where do you think this is all going to end?
[02:11:07.077 --> 02:11:10.478]  You think the deep state can even let us have elections in 179 days?
[02:11:10.518 --> 02:11:12.858]  Or what happens in the general election in two and a half years?
[02:11:15.679 --> 02:11:18.239]  Well, hopefully we're going to make it that far as a nation.
[02:11:18.459 --> 02:11:23.380]  And we're going to have this opportunity to correct the direction that the country's going.
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:26.501]  No, I agree with you, but do you think we'll even get to that point?
[02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:30.990]  It's 50-50, in my eyes.
[02:11:32.511 --> 02:11:32.951]  In my heart.
[02:11:34.091 --> 02:11:34.431]  I agree.
[02:11:34.491 --> 02:11:37.273]  In closing, how do you think the Deep State will try to stay in power?
[02:11:41.095 --> 02:11:44.376]  Just probably through the same mechanisms that they've utilized in the past.
[02:11:44.456 --> 02:11:48.778]  I don't believe they're going to change anything at this point of the game.
[02:11:49.138 --> 02:11:49.499]  I agree.
[02:11:49.579 --> 02:11:51.079]  False flags, war, collapse.
[02:11:51.099 --> 02:11:51.459]  I agree.
[02:11:51.479 --> 02:11:54.481]  So the only thing we can do is educate the public and hope they don't go along with it, right?
[02:11:55.996 --> 02:11:57.917]  Yes, but in closing, I want to say one thing, Alex.
[02:11:57.957 --> 02:12:04.079]  I've been listening to you for a while, and your bumper music is awesome, and you've introduced me to some songs that have helped me.
[02:12:04.139 --> 02:12:05.059]  I've lost friends.
[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:10.581]  Friends have had strokes and died and everything, and Stranger in the Rain.
[02:12:11.061 --> 02:12:18.724]  You know, I never heard that song until I listened to your show, and it almost, it brings me to tears when I hear that song.
[02:12:18.764 --> 02:12:19.504]  Well, I love you, brother.
[02:12:19.524 --> 02:12:20.145]  We're out of time.
[02:12:19.985 --> 02:12:36.905]  I'm Pete Santelli, TaxSaver.
[02:12:37.245 --> 02:12:52.055]  Now, in the next 45 seconds, I don't have time to get into vitamin B12, but do your own research and realize when it is organic, high quality vitamin B12, it energizes every other vitamin mineral in your body and all of your hormones and so much more.

[02:13:27.995 --> 02:13:29.195]  And good afternoon everybody.
[02:13:29.215 --> 02:13:36.078]  My name is Pete Santilli and I'm broadcasting to you live from a bunker in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:13:36.098 --> 02:13:37.198]  That's FEMA Region 5.
[02:13:37.438 --> 02:13:41.799]  I welcome you to this fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:13:42.660 --> 02:13:43.800]  So honored to be here.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.461]  So honored to be with each and every one of you.
[02:13:47.108 --> 02:13:59.883]  Today, it just so happens that, you know, that we've got some planetary alignment and unbelievable amount of news coming to us just before it came on the air.
[02:14:02.062 --> 02:14:14.771]  For those of you that don't know, now I'm going to be covering a bombshell news story, something related to a topic that we've been hearing about, especially in independent media circles, 2000 mules being released.
[02:14:15.212 --> 02:14:18.674]  But in October of 2020, I published a report.
[02:14:19.582 --> 02:14:40.538]  As a matter of fact, I think Alex Jones is going to be pleasantly surprised to know that I had a very, very high-level trusted source, and if I mention that person's name, he'd be very pleased, who tipped me off to the fact that the DOJ was investigating a lot of the stuff that we're seeing in 2,000 mules.
[02:14:41.059 --> 02:14:46.023]  Now, I published a report in October of 2020 that the DOJ was actually investigating these people.
[02:14:46.403 --> 02:14:47.864]  That report is going to come to you now.
[02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:51.873]   Before we get to that, Breaking news here.
[02:14:52.994 --> 02:14:54.095]  It hasn't even hit.
[02:14:55.697 --> 02:14:58.880]  I think it's just barely now hitting the mainstream media.
[02:14:59.521 --> 02:15:08.970]  For those of you that know about a pastor's efforts to keep his doors open during COVID early on, they were shutting church doors down.
[02:15:09.110 --> 02:15:12.053]  Pastor Tony Spell in Louisiana.
[02:15:13.117 --> 02:15:24.781]  Just got word, actually, just as I was coming on the air, this is so spectacular, the best way to title this particular news announcement, this breaking news announcement, is God Wins!
[02:15:25.801 --> 02:15:32.249]   Pastor Tony Spell in Louisiana, a pastor who stood up Not just once, twice.
[02:15:32.890 --> 02:15:35.672]  The COVID tyrants were attempting to send the police.
[02:15:35.732 --> 02:15:40.937]  They were, at one point, the governor was going to send the National Guard because he refused to close his doors.
[02:15:41.398 --> 02:15:43.980]  And thousands of people were coming to his church.
[02:15:44.380 --> 02:15:53.596]   He faced 35 in 35 cases, a relatively long period of time in jail, but he kept appealing.
[02:15:54.356 --> 02:15:58.397]  He kept appealing and took it all the way to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
[02:15:58.417 --> 02:16:04.058]  And I'm so honored to bring you this news here exclusively on Infowars.com.
[02:16:04.698 --> 02:16:07.379]  Louisiana Supreme Court Justice Crane.
[02:16:07.839 --> 02:16:27.040]  States as follows, in this criminal proceeding we find certain provisions of two executive orders as applied to the defendant, Pastor Tony Spell, violate his fundamental right to exercise religion and do not survive strict scrutiny and are thus unconstitutional.
[02:16:27.601 --> 02:16:35.775]   Ladies and gentlemen, this is a Landmark, and I mean, the shockwaves haven't even hit yet.
[02:16:36.175 --> 02:16:39.858]  The reverberations of this Supreme Court ruling as it relates to the U.S.
[02:16:39.878 --> 02:16:55.707]  Constitution and Pastor Tony Spell, who was, if this ruling had not come, was facing a long, long time in jail, 35 charges against him that had all been appealed, the full force of the government brought upon him.
[02:16:56.427 --> 02:16:59.089]  And thank the Lord, everybody.
[02:16:59.969 --> 02:17:02.070]  Thank the Lord for bringing this ruling.
[02:17:02.690 --> 02:17:03.170]  The U.S.
[02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:07.132]  Constitution stands, and in the end, God wins.
[02:17:07.232 --> 02:17:09.253]  An absolutely epic, epic ruling.
[02:17:09.953 --> 02:17:12.575]  I hope that Pastor Spell will be making the rounds.
[02:17:13.035 --> 02:17:14.275]  He's a very articulate man.
[02:17:14.896 --> 02:17:20.658]  One of the most constitutional pastors I've ever come into contact with on the Pete Santilli Show.
[02:17:20.678 --> 02:17:25.600]  And just in case you don't know what the Pete Santilli Show is, we broadcast at 8 a.m.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:27.181]  It's actually five hours a day.
[02:17:27.241 --> 02:17:29.062]  Today, it just so happens to be six.
[02:17:30.044 --> 02:17:33.605]  Hours by broadcasting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:34.985]  We're so honored to be doing that.
[02:17:35.025 --> 02:17:38.066]  But we broadcast five hours live a day, 8 a.m.
[02:17:38.146 --> 02:17:39.686]  Eastern, 6 p.m.
[02:17:39.906 --> 02:17:44.748]  Eastern, and of course, in between time, tuning into the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:44.768 --> 02:17:49.769]  And I have done so for the better part of, I don't know, 20-something years, 25, 26 years.
[02:17:52.096 --> 02:18:23.784]   Now, good segue to my next topic because I've always had a certain perception, let's say x-ray vision goggles, when I see how the deep state operates as I've been in tune with how to do deep research and also build a relationship with some pretty High-level sources that have trusted my integrity to at least keep their names anonymous, and their names shall, of course, remain anonymous in this instance.
[02:18:23.844 --> 02:18:30.989]  But I want to tell you, I published a report here, and let's just go right to this.
[02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:52.302]   In October of 2020, October of 2020, at PeterSantilli.com, I published a report That says, why hasn't Christopher Wray's FBI arrested three masterminds allegedly behind the illegal nationwide ballot harvesting scheme?
[02:18:52.843 --> 02:18:56.665]  And these three individuals, you may or may not recognize them.
[02:18:56.685 --> 02:18:59.967]  The one to the left, his name is Norm Eisen.
[02:19:00.828 --> 02:19:05.611]  I think that if I play, I have one clip that I'm going to play here, and you'll know who he is instantly.
[02:19:06.031 --> 02:19:12.332]   The man in the middle, His name is Mark Elias, and you've probably been hearing a
[02:19:12.332 --> 02:19:17.271]   lot about him recently, especially as it relates to election laws.
[02:19:17.271 --> 02:19:21.831]   That he was the mastermind behind it on the left side of the political spectrum
[02:19:21.831 --> 02:19:28.030]   to set up all of the laws that allowed them to stuff ballot boxes,
[02:19:28.030 --> 02:19:32.592]   send out millions and millions of ballots all throughout the country,
[02:19:32.592 --> 02:19:33.871]  are getting.
[02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:43.836]  Bypassing the legislature, of course, and going to the election boards and getting them to sign decrees due to COVID, using the excuse of COVID, that Mark Elias.
[02:19:44.216 --> 02:20:07.794]   And the third individual, his name is, and why these three individuals are important, his name is Neil Hey, Tyler Keitel, whatever his name is less prominent name in our circle, but those three names I came to the forefront in October of 2020 when a extremely trusted high-level source said that the Department of Justice
[02:20:08.683 --> 02:20:13.484]  I was investigating, and this was at a time when we didn't know about 2,000 mules.
[02:20:14.424 --> 02:20:36.848]  It literally struck me when I was reviewing Alex Jones's review of 2,000 mules, and I had remembered, without ever having spoken to Alex, he has a lot of great sources over the past decades, some of the best sources within our government, the white hats that are concerned about our country.
[02:20:37.368 --> 02:20:39.010]  And they want to get information out there.
[02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:46.180]  So, I did not speak to Alex Jones or anybody that shall ever be named here, but this is what I was told.
[02:20:47.637 --> 02:20:49.339]  Is that these individuals were caught.
[02:20:49.379 --> 02:20:51.460]  Now I'm going to put on the screen just very briefly here.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:53.542]  We're not going to dig into the exact specifics.
[02:20:54.003 --> 02:20:57.266]  But this investigation was conducted by the Department of Justice.
[02:20:57.726 --> 02:21:05.393]  They caught these individuals, these three individuals, communicating in a very sophisticated manner.
[02:21:05.853 --> 02:21:09.276]  And here's a copy of a screenshot of their communications.
[02:21:09.977 --> 02:21:29.890]   They were literally organizing an effort to ballot harvest Now, this epiphany came to me, as I said, when Alex Jones was doing a review of 2000 Mules, and I thought about how these gentlemen who were communicating, and also the impact that it had when I was sitting in the movie theater here in Cincinnati watching 2000 Mules,
[02:21:31.474 --> 02:21:34.516]  I said this is one of the most sophisticated operations.
[02:21:34.876 --> 02:21:38.939]  This is a military-styled attack upon our republic.
[02:21:39.380 --> 02:21:51.128]  The amount of organization, communication in a short period of time to get that number of ballots in five to ten ballot increments stuffed into these ballot drop boxes.
[02:21:51.608 --> 02:22:03.115]  It requires a tremendous amount of organization, a lot of leadership, and I say leadership as far as organization is concerned, to get people all moving in the right direction in a short period of time.
[02:22:03.175 --> 02:22:05.256]  And of course, keep a lid on it.
[02:22:06.297 --> 02:22:10.579]  You can't go on Twitter and say, hey, we need 50 more ballots in this jurisdiction.
[02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:24.075]   Not a lot of communications going back and forth to these nonprofits, because as you know, in discovery, When they take a look at the court records, is there any communication that you have email or text or otherwise?
[02:22:25.057 --> 02:22:27.361]  Well, what they were in fact doing was...
[02:22:28.197 --> 02:22:30.458]  Talking in these gaming chat rooms.
[02:22:30.799 --> 02:22:36.062]  This is a method that these covert operators have done all throughout the world I'm gonna prove it to you.
[02:22:36.262 --> 02:22:42.266]  We're gonna do it right here exclusively on Alex Jones's InfoWars.com.
[02:22:42.286 --> 02:22:46.868]  We'll be right back here in in the next several segments.
[02:22:47.269 --> 02:22:57.855]  I will be breaking it down for you exactly who Mark Elias is, exactly who Neil Catull is, and most importantly who is Norm Eisen?
[02:22:58.490 --> 02:23:04.974]  And how has he been involved in launching color revolutions and coup d'etats all throughout the world?
[02:23:05.474 --> 02:23:06.195]  Stay right there.
[02:23:06.255 --> 02:23:12.098]  You don't want to miss this hour, this fourth hour of Alex Jones on InfoWars.com.
[02:23:13.084 --> 02:23:14.145]  Welcome back, everybody.
[02:23:14.625 --> 02:23:29.196]  You're tuned in live to this fourth hour of Alex Jones' show, the show broadcast at Band.Video, Infowars.com, of course, pages and websites that I've frequented for many, many years.
[02:23:30.117 --> 02:23:31.918]  You know, today I was excited.
[02:23:31.998 --> 02:23:36.341]  I actually came up with a couple of ideas because I've always been very, very supportive.
[02:23:36.401 --> 02:23:55.017]   As I always say, supporting independent media Is so critical right now and this is info war we and we are without a doubt at war with this deep state with these with this cabal and the way to defeat them is to deliver the truth to the American people.
[02:23:55.417 --> 02:24:01.201]  And I've been saying recently and it's so true that without your support, truth dies.
[02:24:01.541 --> 02:24:02.802]  It comes to a screeching halt.
[02:24:04.523 --> 02:24:12.925]   I noticed that that Alex had published a A page on InfowarsStore.com.
[02:24:13.105 --> 02:24:16.146]  Alex Jones was right and I had an idea myself.
[02:24:16.226 --> 02:24:18.907]  I'm going to actually pick up, and I've always been supportive.
[02:24:18.927 --> 02:24:21.248]  I get brain force.
[02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:24.470]  Plentiful supply, of course, keeps me going.
[02:24:25.150 --> 02:24:26.570]  But Alex Jones was right.
[02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:31.652]  I'm going to pick up two of those t-shirts to help support Infowars.
[02:24:32.152 --> 02:24:35.974]  One I'm actually going to put in a frame because it's so symbolic.
[02:24:36.787 --> 02:24:52.155]  Of everything that I've learned over the past couple of decades that in the beginning I thought was all conspiracy theory, but as I did research, of course, I discovered that dating all the way back to, you know, 10-15 years ago that Alex Jones was in fact right.
[02:24:52.175 --> 02:24:59.159]  I remember he was the one of the first ones to introduce me to Western land issues, the Takeover Agenda 21, in fact.
[02:25:01.801 --> 02:25:10.688]  Where Agenda 21 is now Agenda 2030, but Alex out there in Western lands doing investigations, doing excellent documentary.
[02:25:10.728 --> 02:25:27.862]  So I'm gonna not only support Alex Jones at Infowars.com and the crew over there, I'm gonna double up and get two of those t-shirts, put one in a frame because of the sheer symbolism Alex Jones was right, and we've certainly all benefited from that.
[02:25:27.902 --> 02:25:30.624]   All right, now let's get back to I'm going to tell you this story.
[02:25:30.644 --> 02:25:32.445]  I'm going to break it down for you and tell you how it came.
[02:25:33.065 --> 02:25:37.208]  Then I'm going to tell you how significant this information is.
[02:25:37.248 --> 02:25:49.917]  So back in October of 2020, it came to me that the Department of Justice was investigating because they were very, very concerned about the ballot harvesting.
[02:25:50.017 --> 02:25:58.222]  As you recall, Project Veritas had actually done an expose where they actually found people getting paid to move ballots.
[02:26:00.146 --> 02:26:08.209]  You can barely remember that, especially with the information flow that comes to us since the, you know, just prior to the 2020 election and onward.
[02:26:08.249 --> 02:26:16.671]  But Project Veritas actually published that scathing expose documenting illegal ballot harvesting in Ilhan Omar's district.
[02:26:17.692 --> 02:26:33.481]   Right about that time, Mark Elias, Neil, Katyal or whatever his name is and Norm Eisen were identified as individuals who allegedly masterminded one of the largest voter fraud scams in American history.
[02:26:33.801 --> 02:26:46.446]   So despite of course overwhelming evidence and eyewitness accounts, FBI Director Christopher Wray Denied the existence of national voter fraud at all.
[02:26:46.686 --> 02:26:56.439]  But the Department of Justice was in fact investigating the communications that were taking place in their gaming channel threads.
[02:26:56.900 --> 02:26:58.122]  They were actually following it.
[02:26:58.582 --> 02:27:27.265]   And why it came to me is because the information was not being advanced at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and in fact was being plushed, but White Hats at the Department of Justice were continuing their investigation and had overwhelming evidence back then in October of 2020 to corroborate what Project Veritas was putting out In that illegal ballot harvesting expose by Project Veritas.
[02:27:27.565 --> 02:27:42.833]  Now, I realize just how significant it is, especially when you consider and watch the 2000 Mules documentary that was published, of course, with Catherine Engelbrecht from TrueTheVote.org and Dinesh D'Souza.
[02:27:43.373 --> 02:27:45.454]  Masterful, masterful job they did.
[02:27:45.994 --> 02:27:53.237]  Collecting all of this data, and at the time it was certainly a gamble for them to collect all of that data, piece everything together.
[02:27:53.417 --> 02:27:53.917]  But you know what?
[02:27:53.977 --> 02:27:56.498]  We're now connecting a lot of dots.
[02:27:57.258 --> 02:28:06.542]  And one of those dots, and they're very significant dots of course, is who are these people behind the scenes that were organizing this effort?
[02:28:07.002 --> 02:28:10.484]  I described it after 2,000 mules, in fact, in Cincinnati.
[02:28:12.191 --> 02:28:18.216]  I was sitting there in the theater knowing full well when I went in exactly what I was going to be seeing.
[02:28:18.656 --> 02:28:27.123]  I knew because I had published a report that there was extensive ballot harvesting that the DOJ was investigating.
[02:28:27.143 --> 02:28:33.668]  That investigation was being covered up and I said, you know, let's see some forensic evidence through this documentary.
[02:28:34.358 --> 02:28:38.942]  And halfway through, I said, OK, this is this is pretty overwhelming.
[02:28:39.362 --> 02:28:48.508]  The extent at which they connected all these dots and gone by cell phone pings and finding high definition video of these individuals doing this.
[02:28:49.089 --> 02:28:50.930]  And it just struck me.
[02:28:52.691 --> 02:28:54.072]  I was almost overwhelmed.
[02:28:54.092 --> 02:28:55.752]  And this, again, I'm going to repeat this.
[02:28:55.932 --> 02:28:57.293]  I knew what I was going to be seeing.
[02:28:57.473 --> 02:29:02.335]  When I went, I went to support the documentary and be with a group of like-minded individuals.
[02:29:02.935 --> 02:29:16.942]   But we, the people, we godly patriots that were pleased that we were going to have a tool to share with our friends and family members, especially on the left side of the political spectrum, Share this tool with our friends and family member.
[02:29:17.302 --> 02:29:26.829]  I was starting to become overwhelmed by this sophistication because I thought to myself, these are not big trays of ballots that were being dumped into the boxes.
[02:29:27.310 --> 02:29:30.873]  These were like 3, 5, 10 and in the thousands.
[02:29:33.473 --> 02:29:40.978]  Distributed in, of course, the primary jurisdictions, but as you can imagine, I'm sure it was all throughout the country in certain regards.
[02:29:41.399 --> 02:29:48.363]  And then I sat there and I reflected and I thought about the number of decades and then for the 2020 election.
[02:29:48.383 --> 02:29:50.505]  I thought to myself.
[02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:54.723]  This is a military-style organization.
[02:29:54.963 --> 02:29:55.984]  How were they able to do it?
[02:29:56.284 --> 02:30:05.131]  By the end of the video, I was so upset at what had taken place, but even then I had not connected the dots.
[02:30:06.092 --> 02:30:15.380]  Regardless of the investigations that I've done, exposing election fraud, including electronic voting machine fraud, is also one element of it.
[02:30:16.507 --> 02:30:19.988]  Was that the core of their system?
[02:30:20.008 --> 02:30:25.310]  I'm going to tell you in the next segment, we're going to cover this because I have dug into this.
[02:30:25.350 --> 02:30:29.951]  I've looked at the forensic analysis that was done in Colorado.
[02:30:29.971 --> 02:30:32.652]  I've looked at all the jurisdictions from Georgia to Michigan.
[02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:50.407]  And I've been connecting these dots and the software that's contained within these machines and how these machines are basically used to calculate, let's say, for every one vote that comes in for President Trump, they calculate.
[02:30:50.427 --> 02:30:52.489]  It's a calculation.
[02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:57.334]  1.3 votes for, uh, for Let's Go Brandon.
[02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:05.683]  And that establishes how many ballots they need to grab from the warehouse to put in the box.
[02:31:06.163 --> 02:31:07.724]  The counts are matching up.
[02:31:08.904 --> 02:31:12.686]  Are you able to detect this electronic voting machine fraud?
[02:31:12.866 --> 02:31:16.807]  Well, they have malicious software in there that deletes all the forensic evidence.
[02:31:17.488 --> 02:31:23.050]  But make no mistake about it, the source coding that's in these machines have always kept it proprietary.
[02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:39.202]   These machines are used, I believe, And it's a pretty well informed opinion that these machines are used to calculate how many of these ballots that they put in these boxes, pull them out of the warehouse so they can stay under the radar.
[02:31:39.482 --> 02:31:40.842]  We'll dig in even further.
[02:31:41.203 --> 02:31:44.963]  I'm going to discuss Norm Eisen on the other side of this break.
[02:31:45.283 --> 02:31:45.943]  Don't go away.
[02:31:46.103 --> 02:31:48.684]  You might be shocked as to who he is.
[02:31:48.984 --> 02:31:54.925]  Norm Eisen has been involved with similar color revolutions all throughout the world for many, many years.
[02:31:56.076 --> 02:31:58.838]  And ladies and gentlemen, this report right here.
[02:31:58.858 --> 02:32:05.962]  Of course, the exciting news, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruling in favor of Pastor Spell, great American patriot.
[02:32:05.982 --> 02:32:08.404]  I'm telling you, he is a great American patriot.
[02:32:08.424 --> 02:32:16.469]  He's been on Infowars, I think on multiple shows since COVID tyranny descended upon the United States of America.
[02:32:17.329 --> 02:32:27.296]  But thank God, and I say, you know, God wins in this Supreme Court ruling because he stood up to keep his doors open as an essential business.
[02:32:27.596 --> 02:32:29.157]  He refused to close his doors.
[02:32:30.098 --> 02:32:36.422]  He was, of course, resistant to COVID tyranny, but he was a noncombatant.
[02:32:36.442 --> 02:32:38.323]  They wanted to use military force against him.
[02:32:38.563 --> 02:32:41.105]  So a landmark ruling coming today on this.
[02:32:41.225 --> 02:32:51.705]   And you think Friday the 13th is some sort of hocus pocus Conspiracy theory, but it's certainly a day that we will celebrate for a long time to come.
[02:32:51.745 --> 02:32:52.786]  Landmark ruling.
[02:32:53.207 --> 02:33:12.934]   This report right now that I'm doing exclusively on InfoWars.com, although I've broadcast back in October of 2020 that the DOJ was investigating that, and I didn't know who Norm Eisen was, Until I connected the dots in the following fashion.
[02:33:12.954 --> 02:33:21.896]  I'm going to play this video and it'll make a little bit more sense to you, but it's going to lay the cobblestones here on the path to discovering who he is.
[02:33:22.096 --> 02:33:24.856]  I'm going to play this and everyone will recognize him.
[02:33:25.116 --> 02:33:26.437]  This House Judiciary Committee.
[02:33:27.717 --> 02:33:36.019]  Professor Carlin, do scholars of impeachment generally agree that abuse of power is an impeachable offense?
[02:33:36.439 --> 02:33:36.939]  Yes, they do.
[02:33:37.819 --> 02:33:42.082]  Professor Gerhart, do you agree that abuse of power is impeachable?
[02:33:42.402 --> 02:33:42.822]  Yes, sir.
[02:33:43.342 --> 02:33:59.492]  I'd like to focus the panel on the evidence they considered and the findings in the Intelligence Committee report that the President solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 U.S.
[02:33:59.592 --> 02:34:00.713]  presidential election.
[02:34:01.258 --> 02:34:10.471]  Now remember, Norm Eisen, there was some wranglings during the Ukraine impeachment, the multiple impeachments, Russia, Russia, Russia, but when Ukraine came...
[02:34:11.843 --> 02:34:14.244]  They changed the rules, as they always do.
[02:34:14.484 --> 02:34:15.424]  All these people do.
[02:34:15.444 --> 02:34:17.024]  The lawfare organization.
[02:34:17.044 --> 02:34:20.025]  I mean, this is one of the most powerful forces on the planet.
[02:34:20.085 --> 02:34:22.645]  This is how they use the full force of the government.
[02:34:22.726 --> 02:34:26.726]  Ultimately, they go to guns eventually, as we already know.
[02:34:26.986 --> 02:34:29.047]  You know, Mao took the guns.
[02:34:29.127 --> 02:34:34.128]  And I'm sure that the people that are behind this lawfare group, you're going to hear about.
[02:34:35.688 --> 02:34:37.769]  Norm Eisen is not an elected official.
[02:34:38.965 --> 02:34:45.006]  He's literally, they declared him to be a staff member for the purposes of doing this impeachment hearing.
[02:34:45.307 --> 02:34:46.547]  A staff member.
[02:34:46.587 --> 02:35:03.611]  I remember when they changed the rules, Joey Nadler, of course, Nancy Pelosi, and she opened up her bottle of Crown Royal, of course, and deemed Norm Eisen to be a staff member that would be highly qualified.
[02:35:04.131 --> 02:35:11.794]  But in a very scripted, this guy is so dangerous and you're going to find out exactly how dangerous he is.
[02:35:13.234 --> 02:35:19.296]  Norm Eisen is literally the guy who wrote two documents here and I have them and I want to show it to you.
[02:35:19.997 --> 02:35:23.378]  Two documents, very, very dangerous documents.
[02:35:24.984 --> 02:35:27.827]  One was this one right here, and I'm going to read the title of it.
[02:35:27.847 --> 02:35:35.013]  He ran and documented preventing a disrupted presidential election and transition.
[02:35:35.193 --> 02:35:36.074]  Does everyone remember that?
[02:35:37.554 --> 02:35:40.136]  Listen, we're all like-minded.
[02:35:40.177 --> 02:35:41.357]  We're on the internet.
[02:35:41.397 --> 02:35:42.899]  We're reading these documents.
[02:35:43.479 --> 02:35:44.620]  I downloaded it.
[02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:47.943]  I saved it and published it in this article.
[02:35:47.963 --> 02:35:50.164]  I know who drafted it.
[02:35:50.184 --> 02:35:55.789]  It was Norm Eisen, but the name didn't really mean too much to me until I published this report.
[02:35:55.809 --> 02:35:56.509]  So I embedded it.
[02:35:56.910 --> 02:36:02.734]  But the election, the transition integrity project is something that Norm Eisen was running.
[02:36:04.396 --> 02:36:10.305]   This document essentially Scripted exactly how the 2020 election was going to go.
[02:36:10.325 --> 02:36:11.345]  How did he know?
[02:36:11.806 --> 02:36:21.510]  Because he was involved with the Lawfare Group behind the scenes with his cronies, Neil Keitel.
[02:36:22.651 --> 02:36:25.873]  And by the way, they can sue me if they want to.
[02:36:25.953 --> 02:36:27.829]   I have Sourced.
[02:36:28.530 --> 02:36:29.832]  I have documentation.
[02:36:29.852 --> 02:36:31.735]  I have audio recordings.
[02:36:32.176 --> 02:36:34.960]  I have whistleblowers that will come forward.
[02:36:35.221 --> 02:36:40.309]  White hats at the DOJ that know about this and still do to this day.
[02:36:40.965 --> 02:36:49.771]  That these guys were being investigated for running a very sophisticated, let's say, network to communicate with 2,000 mules.
[02:36:50.112 --> 02:36:58.698]  Or at the very least, I don't know about those actual mules all the way down to the mules, but I do know that they were communicating covertly in the gaming chat rooms.
[02:36:59.018 --> 02:37:02.340]  Now, they were also involved in the Transition Integrity Project.
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:05.863]  And guess what else Norm Eisen was involved in?
[02:37:06.563 --> 02:37:07.504]  Not just involved.
[02:37:07.544 --> 02:37:10.587]  This guy is so dangerous, it's gonna blow your mind!
[02:37:11.128 --> 02:37:19.196]  And I'm gonna remind everybody... Alex Jones's sources are unbelievable.
[02:37:20.237 --> 02:37:29.347]  If he heard the name of my source, which he likely won't be, just because I'm an investigative journalist with integrity, and will never reveal my sources, of course.
[02:37:30.536 --> 02:37:41.726]  Maybe one day, if we can count on secure communications, I'll tell him who it was and he will smile and he'll know the validity of this information that came to me.
[02:37:42.127 --> 02:37:46.871]  Norm Eisen, ladies and gentlemen, is a CIA buck.
[02:37:47.311 --> 02:37:56.355]   He wrote the playbook It's called the Democracy Playbook, Preventing and Reversing Democratic Backsliding.
[02:37:56.395 --> 02:38:01.118]  Essentially, he wrote the playbook on color revolutions.
[02:38:01.638 --> 02:38:01.979]  Okay?
[02:38:02.579 --> 02:38:03.560]  Color revolutions.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:04.440]  Norm Eisen.
[02:38:06.281 --> 02:38:08.522]  It gets worse than this, okay?
[02:38:08.602 --> 02:38:09.523]  I'm telling you right now.
[02:38:10.363 --> 02:38:14.326]  It gets so bad when you discover who Norm Eisen is.
[02:38:14.706 --> 02:38:22.151]   In this seat as a staffer, Allowed to be there by Joey Nadler, okay?
[02:38:22.831 --> 02:38:24.912]  And Nancy Pelosi.
[02:38:24.932 --> 02:38:37.535]  Allowed to be there as a staffer, scripting the questions and allowing his CIA counterparts testify before the House Committee.
[02:38:37.955 --> 02:38:40.736]  Totally scripted, as everything has been.
[02:38:40.776 --> 02:38:42.336]  The Russia, Russia, Russia collusion thing.
[02:38:42.536 --> 02:38:44.797]  It always falls apart, but it's always scripted.
[02:38:46.063 --> 02:38:48.785]  But Norm Eisen wrote the book on color revolutions!
[02:38:48.825 --> 02:38:50.426]  He worked for the CIA!
[02:38:50.446 --> 02:39:03.636]  There's another person who he admires, and you're gonna hear on the other side of this next upcoming break, who his hero is, who his mentor is.
[02:39:03.937 --> 02:39:04.737]  I'm gonna give you the name.
[02:39:04.757 --> 02:39:08.580]  I want you to write it down, commit it to memory, and go look him up.
[02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:12.603]  It's a name that I was shocked when I discovered the name.
[02:39:12.804 --> 02:39:14.345]  His name is Gene Sharp.
[02:39:15.293 --> 02:39:18.414]  Gene Sharp.
[02:39:18.614 --> 02:39:39.962]  If you're an info wingnut like me and you go down the rabbit hole to learn who Gene Sharp is, Norm Eisen is essentially the new Gene Sharp that applied the technological methods, for instance, communicating in gaming chat rooms, as to how you communicate with each other, per the playbook, but using technology.
[02:39:40.303 --> 02:39:57.613]   Gene Sharp When he was taking down countries, Cambodia, Vietnam, I mean, just the whole list of countries that Gene Sharp has taken down through color revolutionary methods, essentially has disintegrated and pulverized communist dictatorships around the world.
[02:39:57.973 --> 02:39:59.734]  That was done by Gene Sharp.
[02:40:00.094 --> 02:40:04.897]  And his book that he published made it to the revolutionaries in Iran.
[02:40:05.398 --> 02:40:10.801]  They would go by the script, they would topple governments, and it doesn't matter, Ceausescu in Romania.
[02:40:11.561 --> 02:40:13.563]  For instance, he had all the guns.
[02:40:14.544 --> 02:40:19.408]  He had the bureaucracies, but the bureaucracies fail when the people are non-compliant.
[02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:28.996]  So they use peaceful, non-violent, colored-styled, revolutionary tactics to subvert these communist dictatorships.
[02:40:29.436 --> 02:40:30.958]  What did Norm Eisen do?
[02:40:31.458 --> 02:40:42.716]   He took all of his experience in taking down these regimes around the world over the years He came to the United States and activated, of course, all of his State Department.
[02:40:42.736 --> 02:40:45.818]  I believe the State Department is a CIA storefront.
[02:40:45.959 --> 02:40:50.703]  All the individuals that you saw testifying, these are CIA people.
[02:40:50.723 --> 02:40:53.466]  They were involved in the overthrow of the Ukraine.
[02:40:54.547 --> 02:40:59.331]  Norm Eisen himself was involved in the overthrow of the Ukraine.
[02:41:00.164 --> 02:41:04.188]  Not just writing this playbook, but he was involved in doing this all throughout the world.
[02:41:04.548 --> 02:41:15.137]  And of course, these white hat CIA people think that they're doing good for the sake of America to bring down communism and install freedom and democracy.
[02:41:15.897 --> 02:41:17.359]  They think that they're doing the right thing.
[02:41:18.259 --> 02:41:25.926]  But a lot of them know that they're employing those tactics here in the United States of America to take down the crown jewel of freedom.
[02:41:27.737 --> 02:41:31.839]  Quote-unquote democracy known as the United States of America.
[02:41:31.879 --> 02:41:32.800]  Don't you dare go away.
[02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:36.402]  We're gonna dig in even deeper on the other side.
[02:41:36.862 --> 02:41:39.784]  Go get your t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:41:40.264 --> 02:41:41.305]  And welcome back everybody.
[02:41:41.325 --> 02:41:42.486]  My name is Pete Santilli.
[02:41:42.526 --> 02:41:44.407]  I'm a host of the Pete Santilli Show.
[02:41:45.207 --> 02:41:51.180]   I actually came To this show today to deliver this bombshell information.
[02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:55.021]  Believe it or not, I got in touch with the team and I said, I have this information.
[02:41:55.041 --> 02:41:57.982]  I listened to Alex's review of 2000 Mules.
[02:41:59.343 --> 02:42:01.383]  The light came on, everything connected.
[02:42:01.403 --> 02:42:05.545]  You know, before we get back to that, we're going to learn about Norm Eisen here.
[02:42:05.565 --> 02:42:07.926]  You guys are going to be somewhat shocked.
[02:42:08.706 --> 02:42:20.913]  To discover the name Gene Sharp, who he is, and how he was connected to the downfall of many, many dangerous regimes through peaceful, non-violent, color revolutionary methods.
[02:42:21.233 --> 02:42:22.053]  He invented it.
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.982]  But, you know, I do want to tell you, I'm not just saying this because I'm here.
[02:42:28.002 --> 02:42:34.806]  I'm so honored to be here, especially after having listened to InfoWars Alex Jones Show for decades.
[02:42:35.386 --> 02:42:39.888]  And Alex was so instrumental in helping to awaken me.
[02:42:40.008 --> 02:42:44.230]  And, you know, for that matter, he taught us all how to do the research.
[02:42:44.270 --> 02:42:45.311]  Go check the documents.
[02:42:45.331 --> 02:42:47.132]  Don't trust anybody.
[02:42:47.592 --> 02:42:50.153]  Trust that which you research yourself.
[02:42:51.714 --> 02:42:59.382]  And everything that I was researching, I learned to become an investigative journalist with a set of x-ray vision goggles on.
[02:42:59.623 --> 02:43:03.747]  So his t-shirts that are that are selling today, I'm getting two of them.
[02:43:04.348 --> 02:43:07.992]  One, it will be preserved for me symbolically.
[02:43:08.532 --> 02:43:12.056]  Alex Jones was right all along.
[02:43:12.708 --> 02:43:16.211]  And it's taken me this long to figure it out, and everybody else.
[02:43:16.251 --> 02:43:17.092]  He certainly was.
[02:43:17.472 --> 02:43:18.733]  Right, I'm getting two shirts!
[02:43:19.273 --> 02:43:20.074]  Limited edition.
[02:43:20.534 --> 02:43:31.563]  One to wear out in public, of course, and one I'm actually going to have in a frame and put it in our studios here in FEMA Region 5 in Cincinnati, Ohio.
[02:43:31.683 --> 02:43:33.205]  Very, very symbolic.
[02:43:33.225 --> 02:43:33.865]  All right, now listen.
[02:43:34.285 --> 02:43:37.288]  I mentioned Gene Sharp, and then I say, oh, Norm Eisen.
[02:43:38.463 --> 02:43:39.944]  You know, it's connected to Gene Sharp.
[02:43:39.984 --> 02:43:41.105]  How can I make that connection?
[02:43:41.405 --> 02:43:42.165]  Let's do that right now.
[02:43:42.185 --> 02:43:43.066]  I'm just gonna play this clip.
[02:43:43.386 --> 02:43:49.691]  It's not gonna look as pretty because it's a different type of file format, but you'll be able to hear the audio here.
[02:43:49.751 --> 02:43:53.794]  Listen to what Norm Eisenhower, left-hand side, says about Gene Sharp.
[02:43:54.094 --> 02:44:07.587]   Work of this kind and we were inspired by other work that's out there including Gene Sharp's From Dictatorship to Democracy.
[02:44:09.028 --> 02:44:12.149]  From Dictatorship to Democracy.
[02:44:12.249 --> 02:44:12.949]  That is the book.
[02:44:13.069 --> 02:44:19.331]  It's literally a guide that all of these quote-unquote revolutionaries, the people, and you know, we've always been sympathetic to it.
[02:44:19.351 --> 02:44:23.872]  I remember back in, I think it was 2008-2009.
[02:44:23.912 --> 02:44:25.613]  We'll talk a little about that if we have time.
[02:44:27.094 --> 02:44:28.295]  I was involved at the time.
[02:44:28.335 --> 02:44:30.436]  I was one of Twitter's early adopters.
[02:44:30.837 --> 02:44:45.868]  I was actually providing proxies and methods of communication to the Iranian revolutionaries just because I had that tech experience and had a lot of contacts when I was one of the top 30 Twitter users back then when they first launched.
[02:44:46.008 --> 02:45:01.922]   So I've been very sympathetic to To the will of the people to take to the streets, the Egyptians, they get to the streets in the millions, essentially, who are inconquerable if they come together in the millions, taking to the streets non-violently, of course.
[02:45:03.363 --> 02:45:08.747]  Communist dictatorships crumble, it doesn't matter how many guns Ceausescu had, alright?
[02:45:08.948 --> 02:45:10.349]  There was a candlelight vigil.
[02:45:12.043 --> 02:45:20.327]  By millions of people who refuse and said, you Ceausescu, you want to use your military and you want to come get this Pastor Laszlo Toks?
[02:45:20.707 --> 02:45:21.788]  You got to go through us.
[02:45:22.168 --> 02:45:23.709]  They held candlelight vigils.
[02:45:24.930 --> 02:45:29.112]  And the military was very sympathetic and the military collapsed.
[02:45:29.892 --> 02:45:31.713]  His bureaucracy collapsed.
[02:45:32.373 --> 02:45:36.155]  Bureaucracies and communism, dictatorships cannot survive.
[02:45:36.195 --> 02:45:44.582]   Well, this Gene Sharp mastered the fine art of doing as follows, kind of like in a Saul Alinsky style.
[02:45:44.622 --> 02:45:46.803]  He's like the international Saul Alinsky.
[02:45:47.083 --> 02:45:49.584]  How do you get people energized to get out into the streets?
[02:45:50.244 --> 02:45:51.824]  You get millions of them out there.
[02:45:52.285 --> 02:45:58.587]  That's contained in his book, in his title, From Dictatorship to Democracy.
[02:45:58.627 --> 02:46:02.728]  I have it just behind me, From Dictatorship to Democracy.
[02:46:04.440 --> 02:46:07.103]  Who is Norm Eisen as it relates to Gene Sharp?
[02:46:07.163 --> 02:46:09.045]  I don't even know if he's still alive.
[02:46:09.125 --> 02:46:11.047]  Hopefully he's... Well, no, not hopefully.
[02:46:11.087 --> 02:46:11.808]  I shouldn't say that.
[02:46:12.108 --> 02:46:13.609]  Oh, that guy is such a dangerous man.
[02:46:14.891 --> 02:46:15.672]  He certainly is.
[02:46:15.932 --> 02:46:19.996]  The tactics by which they get people energized in a Saul Alinsky style.
[02:46:20.396 --> 02:46:22.679]  How do you get them energized to get to the streets?
[02:46:22.699 --> 02:46:23.480]  You lie to them.
[02:46:24.100 --> 02:46:49.040]   You lie to them and you use the people of these Under these dictatorships, you use them in just as evil of a way as a dictatorship would by using the bureaucracies and the guns to point at the people, but you use mind control and give them incentives and essentially lie to them to cause them to say, you get to the streets and we're going to win, we're going to have peaceful protests.
[02:46:49.381 --> 02:46:50.421]  This is done by the CIA.
[02:46:51.361 --> 02:47:02.345]  Gene Sharpe's methods were adopted by the Central Intelligence Agencies, the military, and their PSYOPs, as we actually discovered this week on Bandot Video.
[02:47:02.385 --> 02:47:06.227]  I saw a video how they're attracting new recruits.
[02:47:06.887 --> 02:47:16.335]  To join in the new PSYOP, to operate in the darkness, to energize people in the Saul Alinsky faction, to get to the streets and topple regimes.
[02:47:16.375 --> 02:47:16.955]  Well, guess what?
[02:47:17.376 --> 02:47:21.920]  They've used all of those masterful tactics of lying to people.
[02:47:21.940 --> 02:47:30.146]  They've now used it in a color revolutionary way here in the United States of America.
[02:47:30.186 --> 02:47:37.584]   As a matter of fact, Black is the new orange, as they say, and that is not my term, and that's not a racist term.
[02:47:38.184 --> 02:47:54.439]   What we saw with the Black Lives Matter movement was exactly part of the color revolutionary tactics that were outlined in Norm Eisen's Guidebook, essentially, for how to launch a color revolutionary, a color revolution.
[02:47:54.760 --> 02:48:06.085]  But let me highlight and feature a couple of very important things about who that Brookings Institute, if you go look up Norm Eisen, you'll find him at the Brookings Institute.
[02:48:06.545 --> 02:48:09.087]  Who is the Brookings Institution?
[02:48:09.847 --> 02:48:15.730]  With Norm Eisen, the senior fellow over there at the Brookings Institution, let's just cut right to the chase.
[02:48:16.431 --> 02:48:21.155]  Huawei, basically funding the Brookings Institution.
[02:48:21.175 --> 02:48:28.701]  Huawei with hundreds of millions of dollars being pumped into the Brookings Institution, founded by who?
[02:48:28.721 --> 02:48:32.844]  You guys, I know this is overwhelming, but I'm telling you, this is dot connecting.
[02:48:33.105 --> 02:48:33.785]  You've heard it all.
[02:48:33.825 --> 02:48:37.028]  You've been tuned in to Alex Jones for how many years now?
[02:48:37.348 --> 02:48:41.751]  You've tuned in and you're watching videos at BandDot Video, just like me.
[02:48:42.112 --> 02:48:44.734]  And you're hearing these bits and pieces that are coming out.
[02:48:45.054 --> 02:48:45.935]  They're all connected.
[02:48:46.356 --> 02:48:51.472]  Huawei, China, a ChaiCom takeover of the Brookings Institution led by who?
[02:48:51.873 --> 02:48:52.856]  It was founded by...
[02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:55.472]  Mr. Robert Kagan.
[02:48:55.772 --> 02:48:57.233]  Who is Mr. Robert Kagan?
[02:48:57.253 --> 02:49:07.780]  He comes from, if you're like me, back in the day, what is it, PNAC, the political whatever it is for a new American century.
[02:49:08.341 --> 02:49:14.205]  Those 9-11 perpetrators behind the scenes, the likes of George W. Bush, Robert Kagan.
[02:49:14.525 --> 02:49:16.906]  He founded the Brookings Institution.
[02:49:17.307 --> 02:49:19.248]  That's the same Brookings Institution.
[02:49:19.988 --> 02:49:21.910]  And who is Robert Kagan himself?
[02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:27.632]   Robert Kagan is the Husband of Victoria Nuland.
[02:49:27.752 --> 02:49:28.793]  Who's Victoria Nuland?
[02:49:29.353 --> 02:49:35.295]  She was the tip of the spear of the Deep State to overthrow the country of the Ukraine.
[02:49:38.736 --> 02:49:46.438]  All of these people connected sending Norm Eisen, the author of How to Launch a Color Revolution, and used technology to do so.
[02:49:47.717 --> 02:49:48.978]  This is just overwhelming.
[02:49:49.018 --> 02:49:56.864]  Now, Victoria Nuland, I have pictures of her sitting next to... I did a documentary film when I was investigating the Ukraine overthrow.
[02:49:57.225 --> 02:49:58.165]  Sitting next to who?
[02:49:59.506 --> 02:50:00.747]  Eric Ciaramella.
[02:50:01.528 --> 02:50:02.149]  No joke.
[02:50:02.789 --> 02:50:11.336]  Sitting in a conference room in the embassy in the Ukraine with Eric Ciaramella, the supposed whistleblower of Mr. Shifty Schiff.
[02:50:11.934 --> 02:50:16.938]  Who's also connected to, you know, obviously by marriage.
[02:50:17.398 --> 02:50:22.682]  You've got the neocon, Robert Kagan, Victoria Nolan, Eric Ciaramella.
[02:50:23.863 --> 02:50:25.584]  It's very, very incestuous.
[02:50:25.924 --> 02:50:29.707]  And the same guy that wrote, and there it is, absolutely fantastic.
[02:50:29.747 --> 02:50:31.808]  That Eric Ciaramella right there.
[02:50:31.848 --> 02:50:33.289]  Thank you very much, guys.
[02:50:35.151 --> 02:50:37.112]  So, how does this all come together?
[02:50:37.132 --> 02:50:38.153]  How do we connect these dots?
[02:50:38.293 --> 02:50:38.733]  Guess what?
[02:50:39.434 --> 02:50:39.914]  That man.
[02:50:40.856 --> 02:50:43.458]  That you just heard, that said that he admires Gene Sharp.
[02:50:43.779 --> 02:50:57.831]  And right in front of the Brookings Institute banner, right behind that, wrote the Election Transition Integrity Project, published that on the internet.
[02:50:58.191 --> 02:51:26.213]   And ladies and gentlemen, let's go back around full circle, a source that had come to me At the very, very highest levels, who had been, of course, as a white hat, trying to get out the information that the DOJ was investigating Norm Eisen for conducting a covert communications operation in Xbox gaming channels and other methods.
[02:51:26.253 --> 02:51:28.795]  Now, is this a conspiracy theory?
[02:51:29.295 --> 02:51:30.036]  No, it is not.
[02:51:31.203 --> 02:51:55.656]   I think we have on the other side of this break a couple of minutes I will disclose to you just how important these covert communication methods are because we discovered in Benghazi That the guys that were on the ground in Benghazi were in fact talking to CIA operators, talking in the gaming chat rooms.
[02:51:55.937 --> 02:51:56.297]  You know what?
[02:51:56.317 --> 02:52:00.218]  That's actually going to conclude this segment.
[02:52:00.979 --> 02:52:03.140]  This very special hour goes very, very quickly.
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:07.501]  We will continue to provide updates to you on our show.
[02:52:07.681 --> 02:52:12.944]  And of course, I'm sure that Alex will be connecting the dots as we go in the coming days, weeks and months.
[02:52:13.043 --> 02:52:20.043]  Thanks everybody.
[02:52:20.043 --> 02:52:23.643]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at InfoWars.
[02:52:24.415 --> 02:52:29.480]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:52:30.521 --> 02:52:31.822]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:52:32.843 --> 02:52:42.973]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word of mouth, and shopping with us, and supporting us, while at the same time getting great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:52:44.304 --> 02:53:02.792]  But now because of supply chain breakdowns, and now because of all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits, and the slanted nature of those attacks, we are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America is pushed up against a wall.
[02:53:03.113 --> 02:53:10.008]   And we're being bullied, we're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us, To be able to get to you.
[02:53:10.088 --> 02:53:18.891]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers, and ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:53:19.832 --> 02:53:20.872]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:53:20.992 --> 02:53:47.519]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com, where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:53:48.239 --> 02:53:56.584]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:53:56.885 --> 02:54:00.567]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:54:00.827 --> 02:54:16.363]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand, this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like InfoWars.
[02:54:16.823 --> 02:54:24.365]  Think of the millions of people that learned about Ivermectin and Zinc and Vitamin D and Hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:54:24.726 --> 02:54:29.107]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:54:29.887 --> 02:54:34.828]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:54:35.609 --> 02:54:38.129]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:54:38.249 --> 02:54:43.431]  Think about our 9-11 in Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalists and the occult.
[02:54:43.731 --> 02:54:51.333]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:54:51.973 --> 02:54:57.035]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine info wars not being there.
[02:54:58.035 --> 02:55:08.419]  So I want to ask you to go to infowarestore.com and every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well, where you can donate and we can buy products.
[02:55:08.499 --> 02:55:20.384]  And again, all the t-shirts, all the apparel, all the ball caps, all the flags, some of it going back, some of the stuff's been in the warehouse five years, over 100 designs, great shirts, great ball caps, you name it, we're selling it all at cost.
[02:55:20.764 --> 02:55:25.306]  In the future, we're just going to have limited edition shirts for a limited time, only a few designs at a time.
[02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:29.251]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:55:29.291 --> 02:55:30.071]  We just can't do it.
