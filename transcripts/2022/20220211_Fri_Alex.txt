[00:00.000 --> 00:26.000]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID, everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:26.000 --> 00:37.000]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  are just about ready and if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free and especially
[00:45.000 --> 01:11.000]  if you're a senior, we're going to get you. Everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:11.000 --> 01:18.000]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?
[01:18.000 --> 01:25.000]  So the cause of death is officially the COVID-19 vaccine related myocarditis. Myocarditis is how I ruled it.
[01:25.000 --> 01:34.000]  And then the manner of death was ruled is natural. So the vaccine caused the heart to go into failure, caused an infection in the heart.
[01:34.000 --> 01:47.000]  So it makes it mean there's just a natural cause. But if it wasn't for the vaccine, he wouldn't have, you know, he wouldn't, more than likely wouldn't be passed away right now.
[01:47.000 --> 01:59.000]  Pfizer quietly released an email to their shareholders warning them of bad clinical trial news coming out that they believe is going to hurt the forced injection program.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  Now, we already knew they suppressed the bad clinical data, which is a huge felony crime. We have the whistleblowers, the documents.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  We already know that the British Medical Journal four months ago came out and said, this is one of the greatest crimes ever.
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  You will discredit vaccines for generations. You need to pull it. But did you ever see that on the news?
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  You try to share that on Instagram or Twitter. Your ass is banned. Think of the people that work at Twitter and Facebook committing those crimes to black that out.
[02:25.000 --> 02:33.000]  That's why you see all these folks abandoning ship over there at Facebook. And they should be because if you stay part of this now, folks, you are definitely guilty.
[02:33.000 --> 02:43.000]  Maybe you didn't know before, if you were an executive at Facebook or Twitter, you do now, people over at Google, and they're just doubling down with the cover ups, but not Pfizer.
[02:43.000 --> 02:47.000]  Because in their corporate religion of evil, they've got to tell the owners what's really happening.
[02:47.000 --> 02:57.000]  So they just made their 90 plus billion dollars the last year of nightmare forced medical tyranny. And now they release and read the whole thing on info wars.com.
[02:57.000 --> 03:09.000]  That's hard news directly to their shareholders saying quote, Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical or clinical or safety data may impact business.
[03:09.000 --> 03:19.000]  Oh, you mean because for the last year you've been trying to suppress since day one, the clinical data in the UK going back 18 months ago and the clinical data here going back 30 months ago.
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  And there's all these hundreds of lawsuits in two different federal courts. And then the appellate court have ordered them to release the documents and they said no.
[03:28.000 --> 03:40.000]  And the court said release 500 pages. The 500 pages were the first couple weeks in the US alone. Couple thousand deaths directly confirmed not in bears by the doctors by Pfizer.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Tens of thousands of miscarriages, tens of thousands of heart attacks.
[03:44.000 --> 04:04.000]  So the CDC knew in October to 2020, months before anybody got injected in the US, that's going to cause blood clots, heart attacks, microcarditis, because the top virologist and the top epidemiologist and the top vaccine experts in the world said we've tried the spike protein before in rat studies and
[04:04.000 --> 04:14.000]  guinea pig studies and mice studies and primate studies. And it kills the majority of them with blood clots and heart attacks and cancer very quickly.
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  Now humans are tough. We can take on a lot more poison than most animals. So that's a little secret about us is we're pretty bad ass.
[04:20.000 --> 04:34.000]  But we are being hit and hit incredibly hard, ladies and gentlemen. And they all think it's funny. The psycho death cult murderers. I mean, there's a reason the New Zealand Prime Minister looks like a psychotic vampire.
[04:34.000 --> 04:43.000]  She's a Davos graduate and literally wants human depopulation. She admits publicly. So she wants you to die, but she wants you to live. Take this shot.
[04:43.000 --> 04:55.000]  Well, when someone like Bill Gates tells you he wants to depopulate the planet, and when she says she wants to depopulate the planet and attends those events, and now she wants to lock you down and put something in your body, folks, in a two plus two, it just is.
[05:13.000 --> 05:25.000]  Boys, that's true today. We see the entire global corrupt into a human depopulation, great reset combine, trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes there.
[05:25.000 --> 05:35.000]  They're transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers.
[05:35.000 --> 05:45.000]  They're exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it. And none of it can succeed.
[05:45.000 --> 05:55.000]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit. That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[05:55.000 --> 06:05.000]  That's why it's hard to share in fall wars links and band up video links. That's why we've got to share them now more than.
[06:05.000 --> 06:23.000]  Info wars, the most banned network in the world.
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak. Just let me think.
[06:27.000 --> 06:35.000]  I expect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way. It's time to say that. Damn it! Why?
[06:35.000 --> 06:47.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words are for the meanst meaning and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth.
[06:47.000 --> 06:53.000]  That's the truth. There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't that?
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  You decided, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in London!
[06:57.000 --> 07:11.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object and everything can speak as you saw fit, you now have senses and systems of surveillance perversing your conformity and suppressing your submachine.
[07:11.000 --> 07:17.000]  How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.000]  They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[07:25.000 --> 07:33.000]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease?
[07:33.000 --> 07:39.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[07:39.000 --> 07:49.000]  Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you border, he promised you peace.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[07:59.000 --> 08:07.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[08:07.000 --> 08:12.000]  We are the resistors. We are the info war.
[08:37.000 --> 09:04.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can officially mark your calendars as February 11, 2022, as the date that the COVID biomedical power grab great reset tyranny officially collapsed.
[09:04.000 --> 09:11.000]  Now, they're still going to try to enforce and implement it, but if you had to pick a point to which the House of Cards began falling,
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  really from day one, they launched it two plus years ago, because their own documents, their own arrogance, and a lot of good scientists and researchers,
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  they weren't going to let them get away with it. So the House of Cards right at the time they launched this lie began to wobble and collapse,
[09:27.000 --> 09:36.000]  but it's been in slow motion freefall since then. But now it is a pile of cards on the table.
[09:36.000 --> 09:45.000]  Now it's up to us to prosecute the criminals that have carried out this psychological warfare operation and this biological warfare operation,
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  bringing their world government transhumanist revolution. Now they haven't given up.
[09:50.000 --> 09:58.000]  In fact, now the footage we've got today is so staggering and there's so many clips.
[09:58.000 --> 10:06.000]  I woke up at 3am in the morning and went to my desk computer and just did research and I sent these clips.
[10:06.000 --> 10:12.000]  The crew were going to be playing them. At least some of them are so many and they're like, it's horrible.
[10:12.000 --> 10:21.000]  They're triggering a rebellion worldwide and our system is coming down and they're not listening to us and this is a real revolution.
[10:21.000 --> 10:35.000]  We've got to silence them and then they have the deputy DHS head come out and say that we need to physically attack the truckers,
[10:35.000 --> 10:47.000]  slash the tires, arrest the drivers, Harvard professor, CNN analyst and former deputy head of Homeland Security calls for violence against freedom convoy.
[10:47.000 --> 10:57.000]  As if this woman knows how to even screw in a light bulb, much less you want to start killing people, lady.
[10:57.000 --> 11:12.000]  This is just the desperate out of control behavioral psychologist system that thinks it owns us and has just terrorized the living hell out of everybody for two years
[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  and they've now admitted, oh, hey, this is going to be permanent and people are like, no, we don't want this.
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.000]  And her answer is you need to go to prison. You're a terrorist and I've got it on CNN, ABC, CBS, MSNBC.
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.000]  Even Fox has guessed on saying people protesting are terrorists. They need to all be arrested.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  They're all evil. They're all racist. And none of it is true.
[11:40.000 --> 11:55.000]  And then I've got this clip coming up next segment. CNN is panicking that failing to crush the Ottawa convoy for freedom will spark a worldwide rebellion of angry people with industrial machinery.
[11:55.000 --> 12:04.000]  Well, that's the thing, sweetheart. For those of you that don't know about war, that think you just want to take our guns so we won't ever physically overthrow you.
[12:04.000 --> 12:13.000]  Sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart. With a hammer, I can get all the guns I ever want. With a car, I can get all the guns I ever want.
[12:13.000 --> 12:22.000]  What matters is only how to use one. And with a can of gasoline, I can burn down five large buildings with you inside of it.
[12:22.000 --> 12:31.000]  But you see, here's the thing, sweetheart. I'm not going to be dumping chlorine gas down the air conditioning chutes in trendy liberal areas.
[12:31.000 --> 12:39.000]  It's you people that have engaged in the terrorism. It's you people that have devalued the currency, butchered the borders, tried to sexualize our children,
[12:39.000 --> 12:47.000]  and done all of this bombardment with big pharma against us and the fentanyl being shipped in and the demoralization.
[12:47.000 --> 12:58.000]  You have been at war with us on record. And then you try to project onto people that we're violent when you're the ones fantasizing.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  The Biden administration, by the way, came out, I've got the article and said,
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  Prado needs to use federal force to crack down on his insurrection.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  Children jumping on bouncy houses for day 11 now or is it day 12?
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  Crime rate almost zero now in Ottawa.
[13:19.000 --> 13:27.000]  Think about that. And they're calling it insurrectionist, terrorist, and guilty of treason.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  That is the statements everywhere.
[13:30.000 --> 13:40.000]  But of course, it's the ruling corrupt establishment that stole the world through Ponzi schemes that would make Bernie Madoff blush.
[13:40.000 --> 13:48.000]  And then they wanted to soften us up and feminized men and all the rest of it so that we would not resist their takeover.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  And now they're surprised that people understand they want violence, understand they think they can beat us if they trick us into violence.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  And so we're not being violent. We're politically, culturally, peacefully, with very light civil disobedience.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  Blocking bridges is light stuff. And that's what Martin Luther King would do. Mahatma Gandhi would do.
[14:10.000 --> 14:15.000]  And you're going to try to call that violent. And you're going to try to claim the supply chains breaking down,
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  not because of the two years of lockdowns in the third world where we got our supplies from, mainly,
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  but because of a couple weeks of truckers saying, hey, you attacked us with a blockade.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  We're going to hit you right back with a damn blockade to show you we got the power.
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.000]  Because you want to make us put in our bodies what you want or we can't travel or have a job.
[14:37.000 --> 14:44.000]  And that's really the big news here, folks. I cannot express enough to you how incredible this moment is,
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  but the enemy will strike back and we'll talk about that in the next hour.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  I don't know about the positive things today here.
[14:51.000 --> 14:58.000]  All across the world, from Asia to the Middle East to Africa to Europe, Russia, North America,
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  Central America, South America, everywhere, except the usual suspects, God bless them,
[15:04.000 --> 15:09.000]  are totally removing the restrictions because they know it built a crescendo, a crest of resistance,
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  in law enforcement, in the military, in the bureaucracy, in the systems, in the courts, everywhere,
[15:15.000 --> 15:20.000]  and they know because the average person now realizes this is destroying their own future.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  Going along with this, even if you work with the system and even if you're a bad person,
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.000]  you don't want to live in a dystopia, do you?
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  People now know the New World Order stinks.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  So we have dramatic footage of little elementary students, little first graders,
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.000]  celebrating when their family released as little prisoners from the mask.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  I'll explain Stockholm syndrome and why it's so serious.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  Again, to all this, but Israel to scrap COVID green past.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  Boom, just scrapping it. They're all scrapping everything.
[15:48.000 --> 15:54.000]  Now, they're going to try to bring it back later, but this beta test failed so far in phase one.
[15:54.000 --> 16:20.000]  Problem is, it's a soft-kill weapon. Wait till that comes out.
[16:24.000 --> 16:30.000]  They're transhumanist nightmare vision, suppressing the voices of good people all around the world
[16:30.000 --> 16:37.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives, their COVID hysteria,
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.000]  their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  And none of it can succeed. None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[16:49.000 --> 16:54.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  And that's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[17:00.000 --> 17:19.000]  From the words of Chuck Paulinick's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the Great Reset, the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  We make your bed. We guard you while you're asleep.
[17:26.000 --> 17:33.000]  We drive the ambulances. We direct your call. We are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you.

[17:39.000 --> 17:46.000]  We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[17:46.000 --> 17:52.000]  But we won't. And we're just learning this fact. So don't fuck with us.

[19:00.000 --> 19:15.000]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place.
[19:15.000 --> 19:21.000]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[19:21.000 --> 19:29.000]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun.
[19:29.000 --> 19:37.000]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[19:37.000 --> 19:45.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now. The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[19:45.000 --> 19:51.000]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of the World ID and carbon taxes.
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  Things only get worse from here if we submit. They only get better if we resist and say no.
[19:57.000 --> 20:07.000]  Non-compliance, non-compliance, non-compliance.
[20:28.000 --> 20:36.000]  As truckers and farmers and average citizens converge to say we have solidarity with each other.
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  We know about the Great Reset. We know about Build Back Better. We know you're bankrupting us to put us under your control.
[20:42.000 --> 20:50.000]  We know about Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and all over the world.
[20:50.000 --> 20:58.000]  Not just the restrictions are being taken off, but more and more top scientists, more and more government insiders, more and more whistleblowers.
[20:58.000 --> 21:04.000]  Literally hundreds a day, I can't even keep track of it, are coming out saying we were all lied to. It's a fraud.
[21:04.000 --> 21:14.000]  The government suppressed treatments. Big Pharma has bought off the media. This is a criminal takeover.
[21:14.000 --> 21:22.000]  And then all over the United States and Europe, children are being told they don't have to wear the horrible little mask anymore.
[21:22.000 --> 21:36.000]  Here's amazing footage. And the teacher says you don't have to wear a mask anymore.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  And it goes on and on. The celebration. Poor little humans. Reading up to 30% less oxygen.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  Destroying their developmental systems, causing brain damage, lowering IQs.
[21:50.000 --> 21:54.000]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[21:54.000 --> 22:01.000]  Starting tomorrow. But again, you know it's wrong. You know it's evil. You know it doesn't protect them.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  But why are you even celebrating as a teacher that you went along with this so long?
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  This is in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  These children have just been abused by psychological warfare and behavioral psychologists.
[22:16.000 --> 22:21.000]  The greatest human experiment ever. Total Nuremberg violation.
[22:21.000 --> 22:27.000]  And they're, yeah, after years of this, finally we're not going to have to do it anymore.
[22:27.000 --> 22:31.000]  It should be, how do we ever get here? This should never happen again.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  But they know how we act. They know we'll just brush ourselves off for being run over and hobble on down the road.
[22:37.000 --> 22:42.000]  But we can't. We must bring to justice legally and lawfully.
[22:42.000 --> 22:46.000]  To the criminal justice system and every other legal means necessary.
[22:46.000 --> 22:56.000]  The globalists that carry this out on their fingerprints aren't just on it. They're on record running the entire attack.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[23:16.000 --> 23:19.000]  Is anybody excited?
[23:19.000 --> 23:32.000]  The biomedical tyranny trying to turn our little darlings into mentally ill hypochondriacs while injecting them
[23:32.000 --> 23:40.000]  and trying to fill them full of deadly poisons that are made out of the HIV virus that attack every organ in the body
[23:40.000 --> 23:46.000]  and turn off your white blood cells so you get cancer and every other disease and die.
[23:46.000 --> 23:57.000]  No one, that's the bad news. I have a stack of mainstream news here admitting record heart attacks, blood clots, myocarditis
[23:57.000 --> 24:05.000]  and of course cancer and of course deaths and it doesn't matter.
[24:05.000 --> 24:14.000]  Suddenly the Smithsonian and science and physicians world are saying it's incredible news.
[24:14.000 --> 24:22.000]  What's in the Pfizer and Moderna shot, the graphene oxide, creates a perfect biomedical sensor
[24:22.000 --> 24:28.000]  and now they're going to be able to read everybody they say with machines, it's a byproduct of what you took.
[24:28.000 --> 24:32.000]  You're up, you're trapped now. Oh, it's in the news.
[24:32.000 --> 24:40.000]  Yeah, they just announced, oh, by the way, we've now put circuitry into you.
[24:40.000 --> 24:50.000]  Just a couple molecules thick, couple atoms thick actually and it's mainstream news.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  Graphene biosensor will drive new innovations in brain controlled robots.
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.000]  Oh, and it's the exact type of graphene oxide that's been injected into you and it's just a funny byproduct now
[25:03.000 --> 25:10.000]  that people that have had the shot can now have certain new types of medical diagnostics.
[25:10.000 --> 25:15.000]  Wow, and those that don't will just inject you with it and now you can.
[25:15.000 --> 25:21.000]  Oh, and they're coming out, I forgot to cover the stretch, it was in the stack, re-print it for me guys, gals.
[25:21.000 --> 25:32.000]  Oh, oh, they just found out that they've got a new mRNA shot coming out to stop myocarditis and heart damage.
[25:32.000 --> 25:39.000]  Oh, you take another shot because of the new epidemic of heart problems including in young people.
[25:39.000 --> 25:47.000]  Well, now they've got a shot for that. Oh, and it's Pfizer, just so happens to have it ready.
[25:47.000 --> 25:55.000]  Man, that's just really interesting, isn't it? We're not supposed to put two and two together here.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  Like Bill Gates running a giant global project to spray aluminum dioxide, barium salts, and other deadly isotopes in the air which now has poisoned most of the soils
[26:03.000 --> 26:13.000]  and they have now GMO plants that he owns and Monsanto owns that are coming to market that will grow in aluminum, dioxide, and barium salt.
[26:13.000 --> 26:25.000]  Isn't that just sweet? Thank goodness for Bill Gates, he's such a nice, nice, nice, nice man.
[26:25.000 --> 26:39.000]  Yeah, there's the Columbus dispatch. Oh, the technology used in mRNA could offer vaccines for people with heart problems, that's just so sweet.
[26:39.000 --> 26:52.000]  All right, let me do this. Let me, let me break down why this is such a big victory.
[26:52.000 --> 26:57.000]  They always intended to back off at a certain point to drive and drive and drive and drive and drive and drive,
[26:57.000 --> 27:04.000]  but they thought they would get basically the whole world to adopt the vaccine passport system.
[27:04.000 --> 27:12.000]  The Davis Group ran ads last year saying that, you know, China and developed it and we're adopting it worldwide and you will buy and sell with it.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  And when you purchase airline tickets and deduct it off of your vaccine passport,
[27:17.000 --> 27:27.000]  most of you notice on your droid or iPhone or other smart device that you go in your apps now and it's just on there that you've got your digital pass software.
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  But they intended to get it fully in place in their own words and they thought that a lot more people would just submit and they thought when they censored folks
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  that everybody else would just self censor because they would want to be criticized or knocked off social media.
[27:42.000 --> 27:48.000]  But instead people just stopped caring and went out and built their own systems and went out and migrated to new systems.
[27:48.000 --> 27:51.000]  And so we're in a real fight with evil.
[27:51.000 --> 28:00.000]  I mean, they thought they would have had us, they hit the panic button as you know two years ago, the Financial Times said two plus years ago, about 26 months ago.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  They said our new world order is over.
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  All over the world, populists are taking over.
[28:04.000 --> 28:05.000]  They're aware of us.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  They know how we're operating because they just write the stuff on the paper like we're animals.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  We can't read it.
[28:09.000 --> 28:18.000]  And barring a giant war or maybe a deadly virus or some huge event to bring the earth together, our new world order is dead.
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  Our project's dead.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  And I told you back in 2019, I said, folks, they're going to launch a virus.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  They're going to launch a war.
[28:25.000 --> 28:26.000]  They're going to launch cyber attacks.
[28:26.000 --> 28:27.000]  They're going to launch financial collapses.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  I don't know which one they're going to do or they'll do some or all, but I've read all their white papers, at least all the ones I get my hands on.
[28:33.000 --> 28:37.000]  And they've signaled they're doing this and they did it.
[28:37.000 --> 28:48.000]  And now we are two plus years into their attack and they are ceasing their attack and retreating right now because they know they overdid it.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  This is a big, big moment.
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.000]  Now the problem is the soft kill, but I'm going to explain how that's even bigger problem for them now.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  Wait till I break those down.
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  Sold out for months.
[29:00.000 --> 29:02.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[29:02.000 --> 29:10.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing, our products are game changing and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[29:10.000 --> 29:12.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[29:12.000 --> 29:14.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[29:14.000 --> 29:25.000]  But when you get high quality tri-iodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly your immune system.
[29:25.000 --> 29:35.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at mfollowshore.com.
[29:35.000 --> 29:43.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body takes about two weeks to get on average, you really need to experience X3.
[29:43.000 --> 29:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[29:51.000 --> 29:56.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the mfollower, a true 360 win.
[29:56.000 --> 29:59.000]  So again, X3 back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[29:59.000 --> 30:09.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world, with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown, with the next phase of the great reset being a stage cyber attack,
[30:09.000 --> 30:20.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe, and war with Russia, with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place,
[30:20.000 --> 30:28.000]  like supply chain rate nouns, you need to get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[30:28.000 --> 30:38.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered their storable food at 25% off, four years.
[30:38.000 --> 30:52.000]  But right now, it's 25% off until February 13, 2022, a little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[30:52.000 --> 30:59.000]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[30:59.000 --> 31:10.000]  Something very rare is going on, and it ends in just three days as of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[31:10.000 --> 31:19.000]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high quality, storable foods at preparewithalix.com will end.
[31:19.000 --> 31:27.000]  That's 25% off already the lowest prices you're going to find on high quality, storable food at infowarstore.com.
[31:27.000 --> 31:36.000]  Again, you can go to preparewithalix.com or infowarstore.com, and it takes you to the same place.
[31:36.000 --> 31:47.000]  50% off as well on super high quality products like X3, The Deep Earth, Bristol iodine, that sale is going on as well.
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  It doesn't end on Monday, it'll end in a few weeks, and we're almost sold out of the product.
[31:51.000 --> 31:59.000]  Everybody needs to have storable food to be prepared to become self-sufficient now with the best high quality food at the lowest prices at infowarstore.com.
[31:59.000 --> 32:08.000]  This is a great sponsor. We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high quality, high rated, satellite phone.

[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things for your car and your house that also are on the site.
[32:17.000 --> 32:21.000]  infowarstore.com, that's just a site that takes you to these folks.

[32:41.000 --> 32:47.000]  So the calls you were free were like a regular cell phone. You're not being tracked or traced. And I keep one in my car.
[32:47.000 --> 32:51.000]  I've given it to my parents as gifts way out the middle of nowhere where regular phones don't work. They work.
[32:51.000 --> 33:12.000]  infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-4195, then 20 and ask the Alex Jones special.
[33:12.000 --> 33:33.000]  The Alex Jones show. Because there is a war. Or you are mine.
[33:33.000 --> 33:43.000]  You are mine.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this February 11, 2022 broadcast all over the world.
[33:49.000 --> 33:59.000]  The biomedical worldwide tyranny of the COVID power grab is collapsing. The corporate global governance assault is falling apart.
[33:59.000 --> 34:09.000]  In the former penal colony of Australia and the globalist controlled system of Canada and of course the birthplace of Hitler,
[34:09.000 --> 34:17.000]  the beautiful nation of Austria, all of their authoritarian past are launching full scale tyranny.
[34:17.000 --> 34:25.000]  Please put the Bloomberg headline on screen. The province of Ontario has declared martial law.
[34:25.000 --> 34:44.000]  Ontario declared state of emergency over blocked U.S. bridge says $100,000 fine and prison sentences if you protest.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  And of course they're going to try to expand that into other areas. That is the terrorism of the globalist.
[34:51.000 --> 34:57.000]  That's like Tiananmen Square. We're going to attack you. We're going to arrest you if you try to blockade things.
[34:57.000 --> 35:05.000]  But when they blockade everybody, you know the worst part about the 15 days to flatten the curve is the first two years.
[35:05.000 --> 35:14.000]  You know what happens. And that's what Biden is in the news telling Trudeau yesterday to do.
[35:14.000 --> 35:21.000]  To quote, use federal force to crush your insurrection because you don't want to be made to take experimental shots.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  You don't want to be made to make your kids wear a mask. You don't want to be made to stay in your house when they say you don't want to be
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  tracked by a phone app by a big brother. You're a bad person.
[35:30.000 --> 35:45.000]  And that dovetails with the former deputy head of Homeland Security coming out on CNN and saying slash the tires also on Twitter.
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  But you got to love this quote because it's oxymoronic.
[35:49.000 --> 35:56.000]  Slash the tires, arrest the drivers, Harvard professor and CNN analyst calls for violence against freedom convoy.
[35:56.000 --> 36:03.000]  But if you slash the tires, then you can't move the trucks.
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  But she doesn't seem to understand that.
[36:06.000 --> 36:14.000]  Harvard, she's just a Harvard professor, CNN analyst, former Obama administration undersecretary of Homeland Security, Juliet Kaine,
[36:14.000 --> 36:25.000]  has called for violence and vandalism against freedom convoy protesters who have amassed on the bridge that connects Detroit, Michigan to Windsor, Ontario.
[36:25.000 --> 36:30.000]  The Ambassador Bridge links 28% of annual trade movement between the U.S. and Canada.
[36:30.000 --> 36:36.000]  She tweeted slash the tires, empty gas tanks, arrest the drivers and move the trucks.
[36:36.000 --> 36:46.000]  And in that order, the convoy protest applauded by right wing media as a freedom protest is an economic and security issue.
[36:46.000 --> 36:56.000]  Now the Ambassador Bridge link constitutes 28% of annual trade movement between the U.S. and Canada.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  Slash the tires, empty the gas tanks, arrest the drivers and move the trucks.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  Now it would be arrest the drivers, move the trucks.
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.000]  But that doesn't sound violent enough to you because you don't know anything about violence.
[37:09.000 --> 37:12.000]  You just know how to run your ugly pie hole.
[37:12.000 --> 37:17.000]  Don't you, sweetheart?
[37:17.000 --> 37:26.000]  Slash the tires, empty the gas tanks and arrest the drivers.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  Look at that woman.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  Every one of them looks like some demon out of a freak show.
[37:31.000 --> 37:36.000]  Like if Rob Zombie was going to make a new house with a thousand corpses, he wouldn't need any makeup.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  He wouldn't need anything.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  He'd just hire the cast of Seein' In.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  Her and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and all of them.
[37:45.000 --> 37:49.000]  And you ask, why are there, why, oh my God, look at her.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  These are real photos that she puts out about herself.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  Because she's in charge.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  She'll do whatever she's told.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  She's Homeland Security.
[38:00.000 --> 38:05.000]  Slash the tires, empty the gas tanks,
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  arrest the drivers and then move the trucks.
[38:09.000 --> 38:17.000]  How about get an inflatable raft when your ship's sinking and then stab holes in it so you sink?
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  I mean, it's just moron.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  But they want a war.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  They want to burn down the police stations.
[38:23.000 --> 38:28.000]  And then when a few hundred people get waved into the Capitol on January 6th, they call it worse than 9-11.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  As bad as Pearl Harbor.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  You know, that doesn't make sense.
[38:35.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's asinine.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  That's their whole point is their confidence.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  They're in charge.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  They've stolen control.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  They've got election fraud.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  They believe they're invincible.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  They're in their own cocoons at Yale and Harvard and all the rest of it.
[38:46.000 --> 38:53.000]  And they don't know the whole world's turned against them, but they're starting to figure it out.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  Let's play this absolutely insane headline here.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  This is a protesters want all COVID measures mandates lifted.
[39:02.000 --> 39:09.000]  And listen how unaware they are, how they have no self-awareness of how they're talking about people.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  And it's terrible and it's spreading and they're not doing what we say.
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.000]  And the minute people push back, they go, oh, all the restrictions are off.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  All the restrictions are off.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  All the restrictions are off because these aren't even soldiers, folks.
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.000]  Soldiers and old-fashioned systems that would take over that were authoritarian just wanted the land and the power and the women.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  And they usually wanted to make things better.
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  Though there'd be problems.
[39:33.000 --> 39:38.000]  This isn't some dictator ship that just wants to be in charge of a big, prosperous system.
[39:38.000 --> 39:47.000]  They want to mess with everybody and make everybody as miserable as they are.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  But when Black Lives Matter loots, CNN, there was almost no coverage.
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  When Democrats storm capitals and attack people, that's okay.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  But when they storm CNN, they storm the capital of lies.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  They know who the enemies are.
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  I'm not saying storm CNN.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  They've already destroyed themselves.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[40:09.000 --> 40:14.000]  So here's part of the CNN analyst up there with this weird Atlantic accent.
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  Oh my gosh, Buffy, what are we going to do?
[40:17.000 --> 40:18.000]  I don't know.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  It's how they're not doing what we say.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  We call them names and it doesn't work anymore.
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  We have no one's watching us.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  There's thousands of others that work here, but no one tunes in.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  What do we do?
[40:32.000 --> 40:36.000]  Just arrest everyone and make them stay in their houses to watch us.
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  Here it is.
[40:37.000 --> 40:42.000]  So I think Canadians generally and maybe the international community as well is looking at this
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.000]  and we're just scratching our heads and wondering why we really haven't had a more fast solution.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  Because in failing to act, quite frankly, I think this movement has spread within Canada
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  and also now might be spreading internationally.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Yeah, and we want to talk about that because the longer they stay,
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  the more they do inspire others across the globe.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  We know that there have been similar demonstrations in New Zealand and across Europe
[41:08.000 --> 41:12.000]  tapping into the anti-vaccine sentiment, pandemic fatigue,
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.000]  and also inciting this civil disobedience.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  And now the U.S. Department of Homeland Security says truck of convoys like these
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  could soon disrupt the Super Bowl in the United States.
[41:23.000 --> 41:26.000]  And of course, the State of the Union and other big events.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  How bad do you think this could get and how do you stop this?
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  Well, honestly, I never expected it to get really to this point.
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  I mean, I was well aware of who was organizing this event.
[41:37.000 --> 41:43.000]  But if you had told me this would spark off a worldwide rebellion of angry people with
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  industrial machinery, I would not have believed that three weeks.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  Well, thank God we all know about the bill that passed last year
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  for kill switches in all the vehicles to control us, folks.
[41:54.000 --> 41:57.000]  It's a technocracy. It's a total takeover.
[41:57.000 --> 42:00.000]  And these women work at the collapsing CNN,
[42:00.000 --> 42:05.000]  but they believe if it's got the big old name, it must be what's powerful.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  It doesn't have viewers, doesn't have respect,
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  most untrusted name in media.
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  And now you see the Z team.
[42:12.000 --> 42:17.000]  You now see the bottom of the barrel who they're throwing up there
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  to lie to everybody and to just sit there and try to gaslight people.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  I mean, can you imagine the 100,000 people that watch the average show on CNN
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  tuning into this?
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  You put us under siege. You enslaved us.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  Now, I didn't get to the main point this segment, I will, about the soft kill.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  Why the globalists have really got a big problem on their hands.
[42:36.000 --> 42:40.000]  You see, they needed to be able to have a total takeover by now,
[42:40.000 --> 42:45.000]  censor everybody, clamp down, and have new lockdowns in,
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.000]  so that in the future, when everybody starts dying, which is already happening,
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  they could cover it up.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  Instead, they've lost control of the whole narrative,
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  and people now know what they've done.
[42:54.000 --> 42:59.000]  So as the deaths mount, it's inevitable the globalists will pay.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  Sold out for months.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[43:03.000 --> 43:06.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game changing,
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  our products are game changing,
[43:08.000 --> 43:11.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated,
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  but when you get high quality tri-iodine,
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  at 50%off and in FullWarsHore.com.
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[43:38.000 --> 43:41.000]  and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to kick in on average,
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it,
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  but particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  and it funds the M4 War, a true 360 win.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50%off for a limited time.
[44:00.000 --> 44:04.000]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  and with spiritual warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  It's all come out.
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator,
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  and we are powerful.
[44:17.000 --> 44:20.000]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  So that's why I repeat that famous Internet saying
[44:22.000 --> 44:25.000]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy,
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  is it true?
[44:27.000 --> 44:30.000]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  if the situation was hopeless.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.000]  and all their evil and all their cultural death
[44:38.000 --> 44:42.000]  because they know we are strong
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  and they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep M4 Wars in the air now more than ever.
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe hand.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  And we are opposing the one world government
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[45:05.000 --> 45:08.000]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[45:08.000 --> 45:11.000]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  of having 80% of the population hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[45:22.000 --> 45:25.000]  hive mind in less than 9 years.
[45:25.000 --> 45:28.000]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  we know this is all really happening
[45:30.000 --> 45:32.000]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  But there is only two things to do.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  But even when we win, and we eventually will,
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[45:51.000 --> 45:56.000]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  and life-saving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  With all the craziness going on in the world,
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  with the globalists plotting their next big lockdown,
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  with the next phase of the Great Reset being a stage-cyber attack,
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  with the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  but in Europe, and war with Russia,
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.000]  with the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  like supply chain breakdowns,
[46:22.000 --> 46:26.000]  you need to get prepared now with high-quality storable food
[46:26.000 --> 46:31.000]  that is ready to ship. And it's been four years since my Patreon supply
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  at PrepareWithAlex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  Four years. But right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this
[46:46.000 --> 46:53.000]  to get 25% off at PrepareWithAlex.com on the entire catalog of my Patreon supply.
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  Act now, get prepared now. This is absolutely essential
[46:57.000 --> 47:26.000]  for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.000]  So this is a big, big, big deal, ladies and gentlemen,
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  on this live Friday broadcast.
[47:34.000 --> 47:37.000]  And I said last Saturday I was going to come into a Saturday show
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  that I had a family issue come up.
[47:39.000 --> 47:47.000]  We're going to be here for three hours tomorrow from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  is when we're going to do the show.
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  And I think I'm going to do tape to air, though,
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  or I may do part of it tape, part of it live,
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  to take calls and watch what's happening in Canada.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  We've got some big guests on the Russia situation
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  and some of those big developments.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  Biden just came out and said this is a war.
[48:03.000 --> 48:04.000]  This is a world war.
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.000]  He says we're in a war, a world war.
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  And it's a war against the people.
[48:10.000 --> 48:16.000]  But now reading the emergency declaration in Ontario,
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  and Ontario is the province of the capital, Ottawa is in,
[48:20.000 --> 48:29.000]  they are saying 100,000 Canadian dollars,
[48:29.000 --> 48:36.000]  penalties include fines up to $100,000 and a year in jail.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  And they're saying that's for the Ambassador Bridge,
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.000]  but it can also apply to the capital.
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.000]  The Ontario Premier called the situation a pivotal moment
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  for our nation with the eyes of the world now watching Canadian
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  leaders, yeah.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  And all the tyrants everywhere need aid and comfort.
[48:54.000 --> 49:01.000]  And so you've got one brother that was the leader
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  in one of those areas who was the famous crackhead,
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  and now you've got the other brother
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  that is making this martial law announcement.
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  So we're going to be playing both those clips coming up
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  at the start of the next hour,
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  and we're going to open the phones up today.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  I'm going to go ahead and just cancel the guests we've got.
[49:18.000 --> 49:19.000]  They're great guests.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  We're going to move the guests aside,
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  and we're going to take calls in the second and third hour
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  into the fourth hour today,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  and then Jay Dyer is going to be joining us.
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  And I want to talk first when we open the phones up
[49:30.000 --> 49:35.000]  for the first round of callers to truckers in Canada,
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  and people there on the bridge,
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  or people there at the capital.
[49:39.000 --> 49:42.000]  And obviously we'll leave the lines open for Australians
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  and folks in France and Belgium and people in New Zealand.
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  It's the truckers leading the fight here,
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  who during the whole COVID lockdown still kept driving,
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  had to stay in their trucks and couldn't use the bathroom,
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  you know, literally couldn't go inside facilities
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  and had to go through all this hellish stuff,
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  and now they've got to take shots to be able to have their job,
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  and it's always more, more, more.
[50:03.000 --> 50:04.000]  You've got to take more, more shots.
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  You've got to comply more, more, more.
[50:06.000 --> 50:10.000]  So this really is martial law that they have declared,
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  and they're saying that, you know,
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Black Lives Matter blocking roads or burning buildings down,
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  that's good.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  That's mostly peaceful.
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  But when you are peaceful, well, now you're bad,
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  because they're the ones that lock people down.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  You don't lock the globalists down.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  You don't show them your power.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  You're supposed to do what the establishment says.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  This is such a big deal.
[50:31.000 --> 50:39.000]  Ontario declared state of emergency over blockade of U.S. bridge.
[50:39.000 --> 50:47.000]  In fact, let's just go ahead and play a clip from the governor,
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  the premier of Canada there in Ontario,
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  Herr Ford, here it is.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  So let me be as clear as I can.
[50:58.000 --> 51:02.000]  There will be consequences for these actions,
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  and they will be severe.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  We've already started by going after the money funding,
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  the legal occupation.
[51:10.000 --> 51:14.000]  Yesterday, an Ontario court granted our request
[51:14.000 --> 51:20.000]  to freeze the funds from give, send, go for the convoy.
[51:20.000 --> 51:24.000]  The OPP has also provided additional resources
[51:24.000 --> 51:28.000]  to Ottawa Police Services and Windsor Police Services
[51:28.000 --> 51:32.000]  to satisfy their recent request for operational support,
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  and more needs to be done.
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  We're strengthening the tools and the powers of our police forces
[51:39.000 --> 51:43.000]  to resolve this situation and restore order.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  Let me be clear.
[51:45.000 --> 51:49.000]  The government does not direct our police forces,
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  but we do set the laws.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  Today, I'm using my authority as premier of Ontario
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  to declare a state of emergency in our province,
[51:59.000 --> 52:02.000]  and I will convene cabinet to use legal authorities
[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  to urgently enact orders that will make crystal clear
[52:07.000 --> 52:12.000]  it is illegal and punishable to block and impede
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  the movement of goods, people, and services
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  along critical infrastructure.
[52:18.000 --> 52:19.000]  Stop it.
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  Back in up 10 seconds.
[52:21.000 --> 52:25.000]  So does his civil emergency, his martial law,
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  does that affect when they locked everybody down for two years
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  or still arrest preachers at their churches
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  but the topless bars and water open?
[52:32.000 --> 52:33.000]  No, no, no.
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.000]  That doesn't apply when you're running a blockade on us,
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  and now you want to put something in their body
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  and track everywhere they go,
[52:40.000 --> 52:44.000]  Doug Ford, you and your drug addict crackhead brother,
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  former mayor of Toronto.
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.000]  These are horrible scumbags.
[52:50.000 --> 52:53.000]  These are the hitlers of our day.
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  Look at this guy.
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  Here's the crackhead brother.
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  That's the type of trash the New World Order puts in charge.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  Oh, your brother's a crackhead monster.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  He'll be the mayor.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  You'll be the governor.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  And that's who these people are.
[53:10.000 --> 53:11.000]  They'll do whatever.
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  Klaus Schwab says, well, Klaus Schwab brags he owns Trudeau
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  and he owns Ford and he owns them all.
[53:16.000 --> 53:19.000]  Are you hearing this?
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  But you're all going to be locked up forever anyways
[53:21.000 --> 53:22.000]  if you don't say no.
[53:22.000 --> 53:25.000]  You can't live on your knees, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  Let's continue with this monster.
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  That will make crystal clear it is illegal
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  and punishable to block and impede
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  the movement of goods, people,
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  and services along critical infrastructure.
[53:41.000 --> 53:42.000]  Pause again.
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  You understand that you and admitted
[53:46.000 --> 53:47.000]  it was accurate numbers.
[53:47.000 --> 53:48.000]  We looked it up.
[53:48.000 --> 53:49.000]  I'm just trusting them.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  Within six months of the lockdown
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  the year and a half ago,
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  an extra 287 million people went from near starvation
[54:00.000 --> 54:04.000]  to endangered starvation in starvation mode.
[54:04.000 --> 54:07.000]  An extra 40 million, and those are old numbers now.
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  It was 25 million in the first year now.
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  That's made it 40 extra million people starved to death
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  in the last two years.
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  40 million dead people.
[54:15.000 --> 54:19.000]  You murdered them, Doug Ford.
[54:19.000 --> 54:24.000]  This is sure as your crackhead brother
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  who murdered himself.
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  And this is the type of scum
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  that the establishment puts in charge to list
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  because when the first world collapses,
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  the third world dies.
[54:37.000 --> 54:40.000]  And you wear your mask or you virtue signaling people
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  that you're good and you're great
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  and you're following this plan to collapse society.
[54:44.000 --> 54:45.000]  It's beyond shame on you.
[54:45.000 --> 54:48.000]  You people are a curse on humanity.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  Continue.
[54:49.000 --> 54:54.000]  Protecting international border crossings,
[54:54.000 --> 55:00.000]  400 series highways, airports, ports, bridges and railways.
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  It will also include protecting the safe
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.000]  and essential movement of ambulatory and medical services.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  That's key because they're going to say
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  any roads blocked even around the capital
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  are blocking ambulances,
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  and so you're going to get thrown in jail.
[55:15.000 --> 55:18.000]  So we've now moved to the Tiananmen Square mode of this
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  where jail time, physical attack, all of it.
[55:20.000 --> 55:21.000]  They're doing it.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  And it's an example to the world, yes,
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.000]  like China was in 1989, Mr. Ford.
[55:27.000 --> 55:31.000]  Or should I say, hair furor.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.000]  Tyranny's here.
[55:32.000 --> 55:33.000]  It's biomedical.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  It's how the New World Order said they'd do it
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  in Operation Lockstep.
[55:35.000 --> 55:36.000]  And it's here.
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  We got so much next hour.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  I'm going to get to more of this.
[55:38.000 --> 55:39.000]  Wow.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  A lot of big, fast-moving developments.
[55:41.000 --> 55:42.000]  Of course, the War Room today.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  Oh, it'll be covering this till 6 p.m. tonight.
[55:44.000 --> 55:45.000]  But we'll stay up here tonight
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  if they start attacking folks.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  But that's what we were told by our law enforcement sources
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  and military sources and guests we had on Tuesday,
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  was that by Friday,
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  they were going to declare an emergency, if you remember,
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  and that they were going to start moving in.
[56:00.000 --> 56:05.000]  They'll probably attack them in the early morning hours,
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  I would say, of Saturday evening, Sunday morning.
[56:10.000 --> 56:14.000]  If I had to guess the tactics.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  And they'll provocateur some as well.
[56:16.000 --> 56:19.000]  Imagine a small car bomb,
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  they won't blow up a daycare center
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  and blame it on people.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  That's a little too much for their cops.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  But the real amount of police
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  are going to get in a car bomb or something
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  and say they did it.
[56:34.000 --> 56:35.000]  That's coming next.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  Of course, they may not do it
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  because I just said what I would do if I was there.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  I'm in their heads.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.000]  It's what I do.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  That's not from a source.
[56:42.000 --> 56:43.000]  That's just how they always operate
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  before they launch a major operation.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  That's a false flag.
[56:46.000 --> 56:47.000]  That's what bad guys do.
[56:47.000 --> 56:48.000]  Okay.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  We're going to go to break.
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:52.000 --> 56:53.000]  that I did not get the last two seconds
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  to what I said I would,
[56:54.000 --> 56:55.000]  the key to the soft kill
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  and the key of why they're in so much trouble
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  and why they can't give up now
[56:58.000 --> 56:59.000]  and why things are going to get so crazy.
[56:59.000 --> 57:00.000]  That's coming up.
[57:00.000 --> 57:01.000]  Your call is also next hour.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  I'll give the number out when we come back.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  But please remember, we're lists are supported
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  by selling you products you need,
[57:06.000 --> 57:07.000]  t-shirts, books, films,
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  X3 for your immune system,
[57:09.000 --> 57:10.000]  your whole body's back in stock.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  So amazing.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  50% off.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  And again, you have until Monday,
[57:17.000 --> 57:18.000]  I might twist their arm
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  but they don't extend stuff like we do.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  They just can't do it.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  25% off for the first time
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  at my Patriot supply.
[57:25.000 --> 57:29.000]  25% off for the first time in four years.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  They're full catalog of food,
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  but it's only an infowar store.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  You got to go there,
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  infowarstore.com, the sub URL is
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  prepareitwithalex.com
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  and they're ready to ship you the food now.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  This is a long term siege we're under.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  You need to get ready and get prepared now.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  We'll be right back.
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  Our next message is
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  Suppressing the voices of good people
[58:18.000 --> 58:19.000]  all around the world
[58:19.000 --> 58:22.000]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  that are exposing all their lives,
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  their COVID is stereo,
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  their world's gonna end in 2030.
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.000]  Carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  And none of it can succeed,
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  none of it can actually be carried out
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[58:38.000 --> 58:41.000]  That's why truth comes with hard work
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  and with research and with diligence.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  That's why it's hard to share infowar's links
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  and band up video links.
[58:47.000 --> 59:16.000]  Well, we've got to share them now more than ever.
[59:17.000 --> 59:40.000]  We've got to share them now more than ever.
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  Destroy that brain fog today
[59:42.000 --> 59:44.000]  and secure your bottle of brain force ultra
[59:44.000 --> 59:47.000]  before it is completely sold out
[59:47.000 --> 59:50.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[59:50.000 --> 59:53.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[59:53.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  Martial law has been declared in Ontario.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  That is the province with the capitalists.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  The riot police and terrorists
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.000]  will be moving in soon
[1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000]  against the men, women and children.
[1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the New World Order.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  Infowar's the most banned network in the world.
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Neil Young is a tool of the cult of the left.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  What kind of an asshole writes a song
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:36.000]  called Keep On Rockin' in the Free World
[1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  and proceeds to become the loathsome tithesis of the song?
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Comfortably numb is uncomfortably dumb,
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  and Neil Young's the poster child for that.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  I mean, rocking in the free world,
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000]  but he wants to censor people.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Hey, Neil, choose one.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  You can't do both, you dirtbag.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  But there is more to Neil Young's sociopathic behavior
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  deeming Joe Rogan's exploration of COVID vaccine truth
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  as misinformation than meets the eye.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  This is about political warfare
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  and information warfare, full stop.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  And all of this chatter that many have bought into
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  that this is about culture wars
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  or it's about vaccines.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  No, it's not.
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  It's about power and money.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  It's about Spotify's market cap dropping.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  So, a fascinating point is that the major owner of Spotify,
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  the top owner of Spotify,
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  is also the top owner of Moderna.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Richer and more powerful than ever underpinned by its influence networks,
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  the pharmaceutical industry stands unchallenged
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  in its ability to dictate government health policies.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  Neil Young sold 50% of his publishing to Hypnosis Songs Fund
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  worth a reported $150 million.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Hypnosis merged with Blackstone,
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  an investment management fund with $600 billion in assets.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Blackstone is taking a big gamble on
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  RNA technology and life sciences,
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  rivaling Pfizer and Moderna.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  In a word, Neil Young is a sellout
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  who is now imploring the employees at Spotify
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  to quit over Joe Rogan's successful platform
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  combating New World Order propaganda.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  In a blog post, he calls out the CEO saying,
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  quote, to the workers at Spotify, I say,
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Daniel Eck is your big problem, not Joe Rogan.
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000]  Eck pulls the strings.
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Get out of that place before it eats up your soul.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  A self-serving ploy that ultimately satiates
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Young's legendary massive ego.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Well, I admit I'm out of ideas
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  for what to do about Joe Rogan.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  But Young is merely a pawn
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  for a Goliath woke industrial complex.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  He is what I call the king of the woke industrial complex.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  As you said, he is the CEO of the world's largest asset manager,
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  and what they do is they cause companies
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  to bend the need to woke orthodoxy
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  because BlackRock says that we won't invest in your company
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  unless you abide by these progressive standards.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  Or we'll dock the pay of a CEO
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  or fire a CEO who refuses to bend the need to woke orthodoxy.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  But here's the rub-tucker.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  It is not their money.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  That $10 trillion doesn't belong to BlackRock.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Say what you will about George Soros.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  At least it's his money.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  In this case, it is money that belongs to you,
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  to everyday Americans in this country
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  whose blood would boil if they actually knew
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  the way their own money was being used
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  to force a progressive social orthodoxy back onto them.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  That is the defining scam of our time.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  And I think it's high time that everyday Americans
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  wake up to learning how their own money
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  is being used as a weapon to advance values
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  that they would find repugnant
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  if they actually knew what was going on.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  David Crosby once described Neil Young
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  as probably the most self-centered, self-obsessed,
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  selfish person I know.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  And as more boomer rock stars sell out to the New World Order,
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  will any of them actually take the time
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  to listen to the crucial, documented, urgent warnings
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  from experts before they decide to dismiss this information
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  as misinformation?
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  But the fact that Fauci was one of the leading scientists
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  when it comes to AIDS, the links between this HIV,
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  this 19-length sequence of RNA in coronavirus
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  matches a patent that Moderna had since 2018
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  for a HIV vaccine, that just can't be a coincidence.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  It's impossible.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  It's scientifically impossible.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And it's not a coincidence that he ran the program
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  of gain of function that he lied about it.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.000]  And he's a depopulationist.
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I mean, he's caught red-handed.
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  This is insane.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  John Bown reporting.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  we're taking your calls from the convoys, from the truckers,
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  and more when we come back, stay with us.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  I'll give the toll-free number out exclusively
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  for the truckers.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  Sold out for months.
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  X3 is now back in stock.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing,
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  our products are game-changing,
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  It's not the soil anymore.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  But when you get high-quality tri-iodine,
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  all three of the healthy types together,
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido,
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  So, X3, the only tri-iodine on the market,
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  highest grade, is now exclusively available again
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  at 50% off at mforwardstore.com.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  and what it does for your body,
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:46.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  you need it because it's amazing what does for your body.
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  So again, X3 back in stock.
[1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:12.000]  Bone chilling.
[1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  That's the word I'd use.
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  That's the term.
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  Bone chilling.
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  Well, I was born for this,
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  and I know you were as well.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  Born to face this time and overcome it.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Evil has not just been given full control.
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  Evil is here so that we can be tested.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Here we are.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  I have had a chance to read the Declaration of Emergency
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  by the globalist New World Order alumnus
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  of Klaus Schwab over the state,
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  the province of Ontario, Canada
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  that Ottawa, the capital, geographically resides in.
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  And it's martial law.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  $100,000 fine a year in prison.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  And the way it's sold is, oh, if you block a bridge,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  it actually says, if you block any road,
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  that an ambulance might be trying to go down.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  So, oh, you block the road, animals can't go down it.
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  You're going to go to jail.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  And then they'll attack with vicious riot police,
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  the men, women, and children,
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  and send the message that this is now North Korea.
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:38.000]  This is now communist China in 1989.
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  Your right to make a political statement
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  is to play the right of hundreds of thousands of workers
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  to earn their living.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  The total projection of the globalist in their minion,
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  Premier Doug Ford.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  We've been under siege for two years.
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:58.000]  40 million extra people starved to death in the last two years.
[1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  They cooked up the weapon. They released it.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Big Pharma openly signed secret deals with our governments
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  to not even let us know what's in it.
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  And now the death numbers are mounting.
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they hold fast,
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:16.000]  in fact, get that Ricardo Boszi clip ready for next segment.
[1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  I want to start it with the last video
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  that Gregory's did on him in Australia.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  Because what he says about the truckers
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000]  and the million people now or so
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  that have descended on the capital there, Canberra,
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  and I've got the articles and videos right here.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  It's incredible, getting almost no coverage.
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  What he says to them and his message is the same message
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  we should follow here in the U.S. and Canada and everywhere else.
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  And that is, do not be violent.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  And he predicts it's going to end with paramilitary police
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  shooting a couple of protesters, which is always done,
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  to see if that will disperse the crowd.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  And a lot of times it triggers a violent civil war.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  And most of the time ends in the overthrow of the government.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  Now you'd ask yourself, why would the globalists be doing this?
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  Because they want to say a civil war brought down the western world,
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  not their fiat currency,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  and then force us onto the new digital global currency
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  that the IMF and World Bank and UN now have read it.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  So there you go.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  Australian lawmakers fear escalation of Cambria protests.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Influenced by Canadian truckers.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  It's so horrible.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  They're the worst people ever.
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  I mean, they're not attacking police with hatchets.
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  They're not burning down homeless shelters
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  or police stations or federal buildings.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They're just insurrectionist, treasonist, traitor criminals.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  Those are all quotes.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  All over the news.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  You don't need me to play the clips. You've seen it.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  Oh, Germany and Austria and Canada and Australia and New Zealand.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  They're saying, we're going to never end these lockdowns.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  We're going to give you four or five shots a year.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  And we're going to track everywhere you go.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  They've announced in Australia and in Europe,
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  they're going to call you on your phone with a digital robot.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  An AI calls makes you answer.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  It face scans you and marks your geolocation
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  to make sure you didn't leave your house.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  It makes you have your cell phone.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  It makes you check in with the warden.
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  We're all being inducted into the police state.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  Yeah, there's now videos coming out all over Ontario starting last night.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  The police come to your door and they said,
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  we saw you on Facebook say you're going to peacefully protest.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  We just want you to know you are being watched.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  And she says, so the police now watch people,
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  but it's a cute, nice little young lady.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  She's a nanny stater and, you know,
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  she'd oversee you at the guillotine if she needed to.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  They said, I mean, it's to keep the children safe, right?
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  For Bill Gates.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And she comes to the door and the lady says,
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  she's like a steppard wife robot, the female cop is,
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  and she just will help.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I mean, don't hear it from me.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  Hear it from her.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  She just goes, yeah, we want you to know we're watching you.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Oh, isn't that sweet? Here it is.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Roots to who comments.
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:10.000]  Sorry, since you're at my home,
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  can I just get your name and your badge number, please?
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  I have a card here.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Okay.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  It's Erica Ingram.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  Thank you.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And this is just some information about peaceful protest.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  That's all it is.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  Okay.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  So you saw something on my Facebook?
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  No, on the Facebook group.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:26.000]  Okay.
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  And decided to add to my personal.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  The lady then also talks about it in further videos and articles.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  She's telling her, here's the rules on peaceful protest.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And we're watching if you violate this, you're arrested.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  So they're just there going, hey, we know you're a dissident.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  The party's watching you.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  This is what's done in every other authoritarian country.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  This is bread and butter of tyranny.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  This is tyranny 101.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  This is thoroughbred oppression.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  And it's a nice little cute face to let you know.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Continue.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  On the Facebook group.
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Okay.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  And decided to come to my personal residence to give me information about peaceful protest.
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  Yes.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  Okay.
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  So are the Peterborough police?
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  No, you're with OPP.
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  Are you guys now monitoring people's Facebook pages?
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  Or Facebook groups to who comments as to what their status updates are or what they're doing or within the group?
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Because of the protests happening province wide.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  Yes, we have been monitoring the protests.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Okay.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  So there's a protest coming up on simply providing you with information about a peaceful protest.
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  And now I'm leaving.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Oh, okay.
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  That is all.
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  So the Ontario Provincial Police are watching what people are doing on Facebook in different groups.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I wonder how much Adderall she's on.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  And you guys are now doing service calls to give people information about peaceful protest.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  It's just a proactive measure to make sure you understand your rights about peaceful protest.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Absolutely.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  I have a copy of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  So I'm well within that and very understanding of that.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  I appreciate that. I'm hoping that you guys aren't going to waste our tax dollars continuing to do this to everybody.
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  But now it's nice to know that we're being watched.
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  Do you have any questions?
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  My cell phone number is on the card.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  Thank you.
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  Okay.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  And what they do is they screen people now that will follow any damn order they're given.
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Oh, I forgot.
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  Now the Ottawa Police Chief says they're going to start taking people's children because it's child abuse to have them at a protest.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Look, the end game is our children.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:38.000]  They're never going to stop.
[1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  These are bad people.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  Multinational corporations, behavioral psychologists have come up with a takeover plan.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  It's all in the WikiLeaks.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  And here we are.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  All right.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  Chris and Mike were on hold at the end of the day yesterday.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  And when I ended my part of the broadcast, so I promised to call them back and we did.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  And I appreciate them answering.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  So we're going to go to break and come back and talk to Chris and Mike.
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  And Mike's on the other side of the U.S. in California.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  So we're going to talk to them.
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  And then I'm going to open the phones up, which I'm doing now for truckers in Canada or U.S.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  truckers that have been in Canada, your views on forced inoculation, your views on the civil
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  emergency and where you see all this going and what's happening.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  And I said we weren't going to have guests on today, but we should get Ezra Levant on maybe
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  the last 10 minutes of the show or something to give us an update from Rebel Media separately.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  I said I'd get to this, but a bunch of big news broke.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  I will briefly hit it when we come back.
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  And that's the soft kill aspect of this and why the globalists are in so much trouble.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  And the fact that they're unable to carry out their full oppression.
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  It's going to backfire on them 10 times worse.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  That's why they're going to push and push and push and not give up even though it's destroying them.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  But you know what cities and what sectors and what states and what nations are fully under
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  globalist control by the behavior you see, where they admit we're being an example for
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  the rest of the world to stay locked down.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  We have to crush these people in worldwide solidarity with what?
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  The UN, Global, Klaus Schwab, Great Reset, which Trudeau and all of them have pledged allegiance to.
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  That's the outside force.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  And we're just starting to get Congress and governors and talk show hosts to get this.
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  The faster we get that we weren't attacked by Russia, we weren't really attacked by China,
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  though it's part of it.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  We were attacked by multinational corporations that are more powerful than all these countries.
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  And they're out of control.
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  We were attacked by BlackRock.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:42.000]  And thanks to Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan, they're not talking about it.
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:46.000]  People are getting it in a big, big way.
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  And people are realizing that their stocks and investments are being used against them.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  They're going to cause the democratization of that and then move away from BlackRock and others.
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  Well, they're right back to stay with us.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  It's hard to share in fall wars links and band-up video links.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club, dear globalist leaders of the Great Reset,
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  the people you're trying to step on, we're everyone you depend on.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  We're the people who do your laundry and cook your food and serve your dinner.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  We make your bed.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  We guard you while you're asleep.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  We drive the ambulances.
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  We direct your call.
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  We are cooks and we are taxi drivers and we know everything about you.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  We control every part of your life.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  We are the middle children of history raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  But we won't.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  And we're just learning this fact.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  So don't fuck with us.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  Support independent media at infowarstore.com.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  To get prepared now with high quality, storable food that is ready to ship.
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  And it's been four years since my Patriot supply at preparewithalix.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Four years.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  But right now it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalix.com on the entire catalog of my Patriot supply.
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  Act now, get prepared now.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both at home and the world at large.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new sleep support formula down and out is just the thing.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:22.000]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut-eye you deserve.
[1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution.
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  So the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  One of the other sleep support herbs included is the passion flower which was traditionally used by Native Americans like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  We're selling out now at www.infowarstore.com.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  All right, we could war game this, we could go through every angle of it and I'll do that as we broadcast here and take your calls on the All the Show Show on this Friday edition.
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  But people had to stand up, people had to say no. This is the first time farmers and truckers and others have had strikes.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  Every time they try to raise fuel taxes or rip people off in France, the farmers and truckers go crazy and they stand up because they're the actual working class that's left.
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  That actually understands that they're having their way of life destroyed and being enslaved.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  They don't want to live in the globalist ghettos.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And now they want to put something in your body and monitor and track where you go and what you do that we know demonstrably makes you ill and doesn't protect you.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  And violates every basic right people have.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  And so now for what, 12, 13 days they peacefully been in the capital.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  And now it's spurred huge convoys in Europe and in the United States that are starting and of course in New Zealand and Australia.
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:34.000]  And the left is all over TV.
[1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  I played the clubs last hour.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  Governor Whitmer, that witch, you know, famously staging attacks on herself with the FBI to keep everything locked down.
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  She's calling it horrible and evil and terroristic.
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  I would expect she'd actually opened up her actual house.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  She'd find flying monkeys or something.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  This woman is literally a witch and they're tyrants and they're trying to train you to be a slave.
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  And they believe they have the will to do it and they believe you're going to follow it.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  They're trying to extinguish basic freedoms.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  And now they've declared a civil emergency and now they're saying they're going to give anybody that blocks the road huge fines in prison time.
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  Well, they do the same thing in China.
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  They did the same thing in Soviet Russia.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  You people started this.
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  You people did this.
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  You people put the world under siege.
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  And now as you see your tyranny worldwide collapse, they're announcing in Israel and all over all the restrictions are going to be gotten rid of.
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  Only until the crowds dissipate and they're going to bring them right back.
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  These demonstrations need to be calling for the arrest of Klaus Schwab and the arrest of his alumni that have been caught following his orders.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  And that's in all their email and how they're getting orders that's come out.
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  We need to be calling for criminal investigations of Bill Gates and all the rest of these people.
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  We have all the evidence for the gain of function in Fauci.
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  We need to be on the offense legally and lawfully and culturally and financially getting back in their faces instead of them censoring and debanking and bullying us.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  And now Ford declared martial law and seized the $11 million at GoFundMe.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  GoFundMe first said, we're going to keep it and give it to Black Lives Matter, the arrogance.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  So attorney generals in the U.S., like DeSantis and others said, and governors like DeSantis said, and Ken Paxson, the attorney general here in Texas said, we're going to criminally come after you.
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  But now they've got a government shield to steal and keep the money and Doug Ford's going to keep it for himself.
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  That's the added enjoyment that these criminal monsters engage in because they're breaking your will.
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  But they know your will is not breaking.
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  That's why they look so upset and so scared because it's their satanic religion to break your will to get to your children.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  But despite all their criminal actions to inject our children, more people are waking up more than ever.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:24:05.000]  And despite all their criminal actions, the children all over the world are having the mass taken off.
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  And the carbon dioxide poisoning ending.
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  Yeah, play it over again. This is in Las Vegas, Nevada, first graders.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  And that makes them so mad because they want to abort those children before they were born.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  But if they can't, they want to abuse them and chemically castrate them.
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  And I've got big articles. Connecticut Public School District asked eight graders to share their sexual desires in an assignment,
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  including a bunch of perverted pedo stuff.
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  And they describe it all as what types of pizza toppings do you like,
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  which is the FBI manual on how pedophiles have code words using pizza toppings and things to cover what they're doing.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  And then in so many of the big articles out there talking about sexualization of children,
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  it shows the classrooms and there's all these pizzas and signs about pizzas and everything.
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  It's so sick how they have lovingly associate sex with children with pizzas.
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Pizza gate.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  And then they go and find a few areas where it's not going on to say, oh, nothing's happening there.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  Oh, there's nobody raping children at info wars.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  So that means it's not happening anywhere in the world.
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  Oh, there's no Martians, you know, out in that trash can in the back, but maybe they might be on Mars.
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, that's how the psychological warfare operates.
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  We go to Chris and Mike, but here's the toll free number and I'll get to you quickly.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  For folks in Ontario, folks in Canada, particularly truckers there in Ottawa or there on the bridge going over from Detroit.
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789-2539-877-789 Alex.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Again, 877-789-0.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  877-789-2539 or country code 01-512-646-1776.
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  Now, let me finish that point and I promise we'll go to your calls next segment.
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  But getting back to what I was talking about earlier, big picture.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  This is such an incredible time.
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  It's so mentally exhausting.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  I know you're exhausted as well.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  This is just so crazy.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  And by exhausted, it's so incredible.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  I'm so awake.
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  It's so, my brain is moving so fast.
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  It's exhausting.
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Like what's going to happen?
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  How are they going to try to trigger violence?
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  And then it's in Homeland Security plans.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  And Biden announced again on Monday that being a lockdown protester is terrorism and advised.
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  Trudeau to crack down using anti-terror laws.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  I mean, this is all as high a level tyranny as you get what they're rolling out.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Like moonshine is 99% alcohol.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  So they say it's 198% proof.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  200% is pure alcohol.
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  Well, if you were using the alcohol scale, what they're announcing and trying to do is 200%.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  I mean, it's as bad as it gets.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  They haven't gotten there, but that's their goal.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  They're at about 150 proof tyranny right now.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  I mean, coming into your body with dangerous shots, locking you down, making your kids wear gags over their faces.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  This is crazy.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  So as the news comes out that it's causing massive death, massive blood clots, massive illnesses,
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  and erases your immune system and gives you vaccine acquired autoimmune disorder.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  Scientists are even calling it that now, including the discovery of HIV and Nobel Prize winner.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  As the full horror comes out, they already intended to have endless martial law and total lockdowns in and total media control by now.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  But they didn't get their full takeover, like Austria has gotten to that point.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  So has Australia, basically.
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  They're in deep trouble.
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  They're the new North Korea's.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  But everywhere else, the people are bucking and not going along with it, and their own bureaucrats aren't following it.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  And the UN even admits that.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  And so what are they going to do as the death numbers mount from the shots and the autoimmune stuff kicks in?
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  They were supposed to have a total clampdown in place.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Instead, Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are going to go to prison because they have to go to prison.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Yeah, this is footage of them beating up and stomping and punching a woman in the face in New Zealand.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  Because in New Zealand, you're not allowed to protest because they're such a wonderful, free, open, good country.
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  No, their prime minister is a graduate of Klaus Schwab and openly hails him.
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.000]  But uninjected, you can't leave your houses.
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Chris, Mike, Jay, Thomas, your calls are just a few minutes away.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  Anything of real quality, anything of lasting durability, anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to attain.
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:12.000]  And when it comes to information, boy, is that true today.
[1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  We see the entire global corrupt, anti-human depopulation, great recent combine,
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  trying to collapse our society to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  oppressing the voices of good people all around the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives,
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  their COVID hysteria, their world's going to end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:42.000]  And none of it can succeed.
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  None of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:52.000]  And that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence.
[1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:56.000]  That's why it's hard to share in Full Wars links and band up video links.
[1:29:56.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  Well, we've got to share them now more than ever.
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  The only tri iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarshore.com.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:40.000]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to get it on average,
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000]  you really need to experience X3.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:50.000]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body,
[1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the info war, a true 360 win.
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  So again, X3 back at stock, 50% off at limited time.
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:02.000]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:06.000]  It's time to come to grips with the fact that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:12.000]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government are stealing all of your data
[1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  and creating a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:20.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover, they can shut you down.
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards, protecting your bank accounts,
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  protecting your photos, protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:32.000]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  a true 360 win.

[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  Check out the new line. It's amazing.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  Energy.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions so that they could leverage that
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  manipulate markets, but they never allowed that money to get into the general circulation
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  or it would cause massive inflation.
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it and are flooding every sector of the world economy
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.000]  buying up everything, not to have the companies operate, but to actually shut them down
[1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  and force the collapse of civilization, making the companies they do find the only things
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:54.000]  left standing.
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  This is the great reset.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  This is what's happening now.
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  We warn everyone.
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:26.000]  It's the only way to stop it.
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  Hey, I'm not trying to be mean here to the listeners.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:30.000]  I love you to death.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.000]  And normally when we help the phones up, it's just a free for all.
[1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  But when I specifically want to talk to a group of people in a different geographic area
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  or a particular group that are on the ground seeing something, we need everybody not to
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  be calling in because the call screener, we don't normally screen calls other than where
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  you're calling from and you have a good phone line.
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  But he does screen calls when I want it on a particular topic or particular region.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  And so we're unable to get the truckers to get through because the phone lines are all
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  maxed out with people that are not truckers in Canada or truckers in the US or truckers
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  in Australia.
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  Truckers period that are taking part of this or your view on it.
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  And I want to get your quick take on the situation because a civil emergency has been announced
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  by the evil globalist Doug Ford over Ontario where the capital resides, not just the bridge
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  from Detroit in there.
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  And they're talking about a year in prison, $100,000 fines for quote, blocking roads,
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  not just bridges and the rest of this if you read the fine print of it.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  So very draconian that means they're going to be moving against everybody now.
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  And as an example of the world, he says of tyranny and that their lockdowns will never
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  end, they're building the new civilization, forced inoculation, Nuremberg code destruction,
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  and the biomedical takeover of our very bodies.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  You thought GMO foods were dangerous.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  How about your GMO bodies?
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  That's what this is.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  It's a globalist revolution.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  In the words of Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Peter Dasek, Fauci and others.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  So the number for truck drivers or private citizens that are part of the demonstrations
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  or who've witnessed it to give us your take is 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  Now I want to say one more thing.
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  We're going to Chris and Mike and then Clayton and Jay and everybody.
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  We need to be praying for the truckers and the men, women and children and the private
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  citizens driving their cars and everything else.
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  These are great people that understood enough was enough and a peacefully gone with their
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  vehicles to let themselves be seen and heard and let the world know the time for submission
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  is over.
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  And it's a beautiful thing and it's a wonderful thing and it's a powerful thing.
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  And guys, don't let me forget this time.
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  We're going to come into the next segment with the Greg Rees report with Ricardo Bossi,
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  okay?
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  We really want that to happen.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  Thank you.
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  So they want us to just go away and submit and be slaves.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  We're not going to do it.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  And they want us now that they're going to partially take the restrictions off to go to sleep and
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  accept that so they can just accelerate them after we go back to sleep.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  The fight of the Australians, the fight of the Canadians, the fight of the Kiwis, the
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  fight of the Austrians and the Germans where the forced inoculations are beginning are
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  our fights.
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  It's the same global government attacking them that's attacking us.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  So normally, you know, there's something going on and it's bad and one African country's
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  involved.
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  It's bad or one Middle Eastern country or one European country, but do we get involved?
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  Probably not.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  It's still sad, but it's not our place generally.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  You could argue.
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Maybe we should get involved.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  But when you're facing a global government implementing this thing worldwide, beating
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  up women and children, killing people, people committing suicide, mass cutting resources
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  off, starving the third world.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  We have a right and a duty and a responsibility to say no to this and to stand against this
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  because this is the government's flexing their muscles for secret arrest and tracking systems
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  and banning protests and all this evil stuff that we all know is what authoritarian countries
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  do is being introduced to us as a good thing now.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  A head up the worldwide financial collapse that they want to blame on COVID that they
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  themselves released.
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  When you have supply chains breaking down, it's not COVID, it's the hysteria and the
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  lockdowns.
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  When you have the global depression coming in the Newcastle Society, they did it.
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  They're not the saviors giving you something to make it better.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  The system they're bringing you into gets progressively worse.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  It's build back better.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  Build on your bones and your ashes, their technocracy, their transhuman as hell.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  We got some truckers here.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  We got Jay's trucker, Clayton's a trucker.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  We got Christine.
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  Was it the protests?
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  Scott in Canada's a trucker.
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  I'll get to all of you.
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  But first, Chris and Mike, who are not truckers, but I held them over from yesterday.
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  We called them back.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  Thank you, Chris and Atlanta.
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  And then we'll go to Mike as well.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  Go ahead.
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Hey, thanks for calling me back.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  I'll make this quick.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  With the world awakening, I think it was important that we were at them and mentioned
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  right now, take advantage of this moment.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  And I have a problem with an idea that something everybody can do with every listener can do.
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners over highways.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Imagine a giant banner.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  It says, Alex Jones is right.
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  infowars.com or we stand with the truckers or rest out or whatever.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Brother, I'm so glad you called elaborate on this.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Yes.
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on the bathroom
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  wall or to put a sign up on your barn or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  over highways.
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000]  And it will be a chain reaction.
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  Beautifully said.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:05.000]  What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs?
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  I have a few ideas.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  First of all, Alex Jones is right.
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  infowars.com or rest out here.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  Rest cross swap.
[1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  The vaccine is poison.
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  There's tons of things.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  I said, just keep it short.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  Keep it concise.
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  No, I agree.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  Next Fauci arrest Bill Gates.
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  The back.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  The COVID Vax is poison.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Beautiful.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  Yeah.
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  And also I think it might be a good idea.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  I mean, you know, I did volunteer with Brian Paul in 2008 and was really affected.
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  But you know, we slim gyms flyers.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  We did banner banner hangs.
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  Maybe on infowars.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  You could have printable PDFs where people could print it out.
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  So stick these things in a one more parking lot and every car in the parking lot.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  There's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective.
[1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  So that's what I'm calling about.
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  Brother, that's why I love taking calls and why I should take more calls and why very
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  soon we're going to start at least two nights a week and once on the weekend on top of the
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  Sunday show, a commercial free podcast that's live so everybody can call in and we'll just
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  hear from all of you amazing people.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  God bless you Chris in Atlanta.
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  I really, really appreciate you calling us today.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  Thank you so much.
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  All right.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  Let's go now to Mike and California.
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  Mike and California.
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  Thanks for calling.
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  And, uh, call me.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  Fornia is where I'm calling from.
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  Uh, and I appreciate that, uh, the intro, um, that you gave at the very beginning of
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  the show, um, you know how the, the COVID narrative, um, and tyranny is today marks the
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  day that it collapses.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  Um, and I have two scholarly articles that I wrote and I sent to you guys, uh, show
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  tips.
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I sent it to kit months ago when you were looking for writers.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  Um, and I just sent it again to you guys Wednesday at 7 27 p.m.
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  Your time.
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  Um, so you guys can look that up.
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Um, now points I want to make, um, I think we're barking up the wrong tree calling this
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  gain of function research.
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Um, and I've fully explained it all, um, in, in my review.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  No, no, you're right.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  They're creating mutated new live forms and releasing chimeric weapons.
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  Yes.
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  Yes.
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  The actual, you know, 2014 legislation, the U S government gain of function, deliberative
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:18.680]  process and research funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza
[1:41:18.680 --> 1:41:24.640]  of MERS and ZARS viruses does nothing about ZARS like viruses and it's a research funding
[1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:25.640]  pause.
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:26.640]  It's not a stop.
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:27.640]  It's not a prohibition.
[1:41:27.640 --> 1:41:32.000]  It's when you come to a four way intersection, there's the stops on you stop, you look both
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  ways, and then you proceed.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Um, and so it's also, it doesn't pause all gain of function, just selected gain of function.
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  Um, but they'll argue that this is actually, um, characterization and qualification research,
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  um, along with the meta genomics, um, and genomics.
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  Um, I have a, the paper, um, titled, uh, it's right here.
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  It's the guidance for industry.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  You guys can pull this up.
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  Characterization and qualification of cell substrates and other biological materials used in the
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  production of viral vaccines or infectious disease indications.
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:13.320]  Um, so, you know, Rand and, and, and others, you know, maybe Fauci was right.
[1:42:13.320 --> 1:42:16.000]  They don't quite know what they're talking about calling it gain of function.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.500]  You know, that, that's why he didn't perjure himself.
[1:42:18.500 --> 1:42:20.000]  That's why he hasn't been arrested.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:25.880]  Um, you know, so we really need to start, uh, you know, using literally creating new synthetic
[1:42:25.880 --> 1:42:30.880]  live forms that mimic what the viruses do, but in, in, in the main definition, it's still
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:31.880]  a gain of function.
[1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:34.880]  They're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people.
[1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:35.880]  But that's a great point.
[1:42:35.880 --> 1:42:36.880]  I'm going to put you on hold, brother.
[1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:40.880]  I'm going to put you in touch, uh, with one of our writers to check out your articles,
[1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:41.880]  and we'll check it out.
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:44.880]  And if it's got good links and info in it, we will post them on infowars.com.
[1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:45.880]  Thank you, Mike.
[1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:46.880]  We love you.
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:48.880]  Please give his, uh, info to Ben.
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:51.880]  Uh, the great kit is not with an Austin anymore, though he still works with us.
[1:42:51.880 --> 1:42:52.880]  That's a great job.
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:54.880]  Uh, but we'll, uh, we'll, we'll get back with you.
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:55.880]  Thank you, sir.
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:43:04.880]  Something very rare is going on and it ends in just three days.
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:09.880]  As of the time I'm taping this announcement on Thursday afternoon.
[1:43:09.880 --> 1:43:15.880]  Coming up this Monday, the biggest sale in four years of high quality, affordable foods
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:17.880]  and for parallax.com will end.
[1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.880]  That's 25% off already.
[1:43:19.880 --> 1:43:25.880]  The lowest prices are going to find a high quality, affordable food at infowars.com.
[1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:34.880]  Again, you can go to prepare with Alex.com or infowars.com and it takes you to the same
[1:43:34.880 --> 1:43:35.880]  place.
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:43.880]  50% off as well on super high quality products like X3, the deep earth, crystal iodine.
[1:43:43.880 --> 1:43:45.880]  That sale is going on as well.
[1:43:45.880 --> 1:43:46.880]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:50.880]  It'll end in a few weeks and we're only sold out of the product.
[1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:54.880]  Everybody needs to have horrible food to be prepared to become self-sufficient now.
[1:43:54.880 --> 1:43:58.880]  The best high quality food at the lowest prices at infowars.com.
[1:43:58.880 --> 1:44:02.880]  So when I first started taking survival shield, basically I was 275 pounds.
[1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:03.880]  I was overweight.
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:05.880]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:10.880]  I was barely holding onto a job and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:14.880]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield, the X1 and it worked pretty good.
[1:44:14.880 --> 1:44:18.880]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with that shield with the deep earth and the forest
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:20.880]  and I got really excited about that so I took it.
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:26.880]  And man, in two weeks I went from brain fog to literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:28.880]  I could think again.
[1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:30.880]  I could connect with people again.
[1:44:30.880 --> 1:44:34.880]  And over the course of the next couple of years I got my health back and I religiously
[1:44:34.880 --> 1:44:36.880]  took basically all of your supplements.
[1:44:36.880 --> 1:44:38.880]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:40.880]  The one I like recently is knockout.
[1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:43.880]  Literally like if you want to sleep just take it.
[1:44:43.880 --> 1:44:44.880]  It's amazing.
[1:44:44.880 --> 1:44:45.880]  It works.
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:47.880]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:49.880]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:53.880]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:44:53.880 --> 1:44:54.880]  Beautifully said brother.
[1:44:54.880 --> 1:45:22.880]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:26.880]  And they're programming for collapsing us of build back better.
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:32.880]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:35.880]  And because they couldn't take our guns and because we wouldn't bow.
[1:45:35.880 --> 1:45:40.880]  Because the left which is the ideology of this world government system couldn't win.
[1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:43.880]  They released a biological weapon on us.
[1:45:43.880 --> 1:45:47.880]  Now we know two years ago we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:48.880]  It's that simple.
[1:45:48.880 --> 1:45:52.880]  They can't beat us because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:45:52.880 --> 1:45:56.880]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19 and you know the rest is history.
[1:45:56.880 --> 1:45:58.880]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:45:58.880 --> 1:46:00.880]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:02.880]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:46:02.880 --> 1:46:03.880]  Welcome.
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:04.880]  Hello Alex.
[1:46:04.880 --> 1:46:05.880]  Yes Malcolm.
[1:46:05.880 --> 1:46:06.880]  All right.
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:08.880]  I will make this quick and real short where the other Patriots can get on the line.
[1:46:08.880 --> 1:46:12.880]  Alex I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts Owen Shroyer.
[1:46:12.880 --> 1:46:18.880]  Supermal Vitality and Brain Force Plus. Mix those two together you're an unstoppable tank.
[1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:20.880]  Supermal Vitality really really works.
[1:46:20.880 --> 1:46:25.880]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:46:25.880 --> 1:46:29.880]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:32.880]  They also work quite well but just aren't as strong.
[1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:34.880]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:36.880]  In fact each batch is different.
[1:46:36.880 --> 1:46:38.880]  Sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay.
[1:46:38.880 --> 1:46:41.880]  People are like why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong.
[1:46:41.880 --> 1:46:42.880]  That's just how it is.
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:43.880]  It's how it works.
[1:46:43.880 --> 1:46:45.880]  So it's always good.
[1:46:45.880 --> 1:46:47.880]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:46:47.880 --> 1:47:15.880]  But yeah if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price then this is it.
[1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:24.880]  If the government served the people then the government would have nothing to fear from the people.
[1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:27.880]  But it is clear that now the government fears us.
[1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:33.880]  After years of persistent abuse of the Constitution during which time they have betrayed, robbed,
[1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:36.880]  injured and killed Australian people we have had enough.
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:38.880]  And we are not alone.
[1:47:38.880 --> 1:47:44.880]  Internationally the people are rising up peacefully against the unlawful and criminal excesses of those whom they have elected.
[1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.880]  Millions of good and decent men and women around the world have decided that this war for the world must end.
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:56.880]  And they know it will end when enough of us stand up and declare in one voice no more.
[1:47:56.880 --> 1:48:02.880]  Here in Australia the people are gathering in the nation's capital Canberra in order to communicate their intent.
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:13.880]  That the Governor General should meet his constitutional responsibility by dissolving the parliament and appointing a new Executive Council in order to prepare for free and fair elections.
[1:48:13.880 --> 1:48:18.880]  In the long journey from barbarism to civilisation days such as these are rare.
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:26.880]  Seminal days when a people band together putting aside their petty differences in order to secure their lives and their liberty.
[1:48:26.880 --> 1:48:30.880]  In other words to earn their rights to their sovereign nationhood.
[1:48:30.880 --> 1:48:34.880]  Now is the time to play your part in the liberation of Australia.
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:38.880]  Now is the time to stand alongside your fellow Australians and resist tyranny.
[1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:43.880]  Now is the time to ensure your children and grandchildren are free.
[1:48:43.880 --> 1:48:48.880]  You were here because generations ago your ancestors sacrificed all for you.
[1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:50.880]  It is now time to pay that debt forward.
[1:48:50.880 --> 1:48:53.880]  Now nothing else matters.
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:56.880]  This is not about politics. This is a non-political event.
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  This is about our very lives and our very future.
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:02.880]  You must strong everything and get to Canberra as soon as you can.
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:08.880]  Some have made their way from far afield as Adelaide, Melbourne and Rockhampton.
[1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:10.880]  What's your excuse?
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:14.880]  And they plan to stay until we win.
[1:49:14.880 --> 1:49:17.880]  Remain calm regardless of the force used against you.
[1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:23.880]  They will provoke a reaction which ultimately will see the use of police snipers opening fire.
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:27.880]  This is a reality regardless of the force used against you.
[1:49:27.880 --> 1:49:31.880]  You must, we must remain calm in order to win.
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:34.880]  Fly, drive, walk if you must.
[1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  But we need an army of millions in Canberra to win this war.
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:40.880]  And we will win if you attend.
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:42.880]  Pack up as much food and water as you can.
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.880]  The people already there are sharing and cooperating as never before.
[1:49:46.880 --> 1:49:48.880]  If you can't find accommodations, sleep in your car.
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:50.880]  We must come together now.
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:52.880]  This is our time.
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:53.880]  We the people.
[1:49:53.880 --> 1:49:56.880]  Do it for your family and do it for the future of Australia.
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:03.880]  I'm Ricardo Bosie, I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:07.880]  We are fighting a UN corporate black rock attack.
[1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:09.880]  This is the great awakening.
[1:50:09.880 --> 1:50:10.880]  We will win.
[1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:14.880]  All right, I really appreciate the truckers I've been holding for 20 minutes.
[1:50:14.880 --> 1:50:16.880]  The whole next hour is your calls.
[1:50:16.880 --> 1:50:22.880]  We're going to go to, in this order, Scott in Canada, then Empire Hallers in Wyoming,
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:26.880]  Christine in Canada, Clayton in Canada,
[1:50:26.880 --> 1:50:30.880]  Jay in Ohio, Sean in Florida, Josh in Canada.
[1:50:30.880 --> 1:50:32.880]  Okay, I'm going to go to the order received.
[1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:36.880]  Scott is a trucker on being at the protest in Canada.
[1:50:36.880 --> 1:50:40.880]  Scott, thanks for calling.
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:41.880]  Hi, how are you there?
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:42.880]  Yes, sir, I am.
[1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:45.880]  Tell us what you've witnessed and what you think about the civil emergency and
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:47.880]  martial law being declared.
[1:50:47.880 --> 1:50:49.880]  It's a total scam.
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:52.880]  They are panicking.
[1:50:52.880 --> 1:50:56.880]  Everything you see in the media is live.
[1:50:56.880 --> 1:51:06.880]  All these police videos you see are very small, minor, not large operations going on.
[1:51:06.880 --> 1:51:09.880]  I've been in Ottawa since the start.
[1:51:09.880 --> 1:51:14.880]  When we showed up to the protest, it was unbelievable.
[1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:16.880]  So much emotion.
[1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:18.880]  So many supporters.
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:26.880]  It's literally one big giant party of good time, patriotism.
[1:51:26.880 --> 1:51:29.880]  In my opinion, this is all failing.
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:31.880]  They're losing their grip.
[1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:38.880]  If they come and shut us down by force, they're only going to lose faster, in my opinion.
[1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:39.880]  I totally agree.
[1:51:39.880 --> 1:51:44.880]  We just have to understand we could crush the police and military quite easily.
[1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:48.880]  Idiots like Swallowswell says they just use nukes on us.
[1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:52.880]  Plus, the military is probably more awake on average than anybody.
[1:51:52.880 --> 1:51:57.880]  They've had massive numbers of police resigning, but we've got to understand now these criminal
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:52:01.880]  governments have to be routed out because they're doing this as a process to purge the
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:02.880]  good police.
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:04.880]  You understand this is a process, but I agree.
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:06.880]  This is blown up in their face.
[1:52:06.880 --> 1:52:08.880]  Their great reset is not going well.
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:11.880]  What do you predict for Canada, Scott?
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:17.880]  I predict we're going to win.
[1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:23.880]  The mass majority of police down there were dancing, having a good time, supporting everything.
[1:52:23.880 --> 1:52:28.880]  In my opinion, I don't think they're going to find enough cops to crush this down.
[1:52:28.880 --> 1:52:29.880]  Well, I forgot.
[1:52:29.880 --> 1:52:33.880]  Last Friday, the police chief said that police that show solidarity could, quote, be fined
[1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:34.880]  or fired.
[1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:35.880]  That's right.
[1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:38.880]  So they've been having to threaten the police to not get along with everybody.
[1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:40.880]  Oh, exactly, exactly.
[1:52:40.880 --> 1:52:45.880]  And the cops come up and be nice and then say, oh, we support you with this and that,
[1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.880]  and they pretend to do their job, but they're not.
[1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:51.880]  But also, did you notice the police are exempt from the injections?
[1:52:51.880 --> 1:52:52.880]  What does that say about them?
[1:52:52.880 --> 1:52:54.880]  They're awake.
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:56.880]  Yep, exactly.
[1:52:56.880 --> 1:52:58.880]  Exactly they are, yes, for sure.
[1:52:58.880 --> 1:53:00.880]  They should not be following illegal orders.
[1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:05.880]  So our sources that we've had on who were there in Ottawa in the military law enforcement
[1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:10.880]  say they'd been told days ago, get ready for riot police to attack, then now the riot police
[1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:12.880]  are supposedly massing.
[1:53:12.880 --> 1:53:16.880]  Do you think Trudeau's dumb enough to pull a Kent State in Canada?
[1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:25.880]  I think he is dumb enough, but I truly think that they don't have, they don't have the
[1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:26.880]  numbers.
[1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:27.880]  Well, they want to stop us.
[1:53:27.880 --> 1:53:28.880]  What happened last Saturday?
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:34.880]  Last Saturday, I sat on my pickup truck in downtown Kent Street, blocking off that street.
[1:53:34.880 --> 1:53:39.880]  There were so many people, and so many people floating downtown, they were overwhelming
[1:53:39.880 --> 1:53:42.880]  for me and that we were there for a week.
[1:53:42.880 --> 1:53:46.880]  They want to stop, they do not want that to happen again if that makes up.
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:49.880]  Well, that's the beautiful thing, because correct me if I'm wrong, thousands of trucks
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:53.880]  show up, do a few days, do a week, go back to their business, back to their life, but
[1:53:53.880 --> 1:53:58.880]  more just replace them, and it's all just happening naturally and totally freaking out the establishment.
[1:53:58.880 --> 1:54:02.880]  Yes, like what I'm doing right now, me and my brother, my brother's been there the whole
[1:54:02.880 --> 1:54:06.880]  time, I've been there during the weekend and at night time, but I drive truck during the
[1:54:06.880 --> 1:54:13.880]  day, so I have to go and work, but they, in my opinion, they can't even shut it down
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:17.880]  even if they try, because we will just go home and come back in a week or come back in
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:18.880]  the next weekend.
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:21.880]  Well, you know why they want kill switches in all the cars, which they've now done, is
[1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:23.880]  in the future, they're just going to have AI kill your car.
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:28.880]  That's why we've got to stop them getting us on the AI Global Social Credit Score, the
[1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:30.880]  basis of which is the vaccine passport.
[1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:31.880]  That's why this is so key.
[1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:35.880]  Well, brother, thank you for calling and thank you for everything, and be safe when we're
[1:54:35.880 --> 1:54:39.880]  praying for all you guys and gals, and let them know everybody around the world is praying
[1:54:39.880 --> 1:54:42.880]  for you, and we appreciate you standing up for our freedom.
[1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:46.880]  Thanks, Alex, and we're not going to back down.
[1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:47.880]  Thank you.
[1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:51.880]  You know, Christians and conservatives and hard workers mind their business so much that
[1:54:51.880 --> 1:54:55.880]  I don't get in Oklahoma's business, I don't get in New Yorker's business, we see what happens
[1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:00.880]  in California, and we wish it wasn't happening, but when you're dealing with the New World
[1:55:00.880 --> 1:55:04.880]  Order folks, it's a global corporate big pharma UN takeover.
[1:55:04.880 --> 1:55:09.880]  So if they're enslaving the Canadians, they're in your house as well.
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:16.880]  This is the same damn enemy, like if aliens attacked, and aliens blew up Moscow or Durban,
[1:55:16.880 --> 1:55:20.880]  South Africa, you'd be just as pissed as if they blew up Dallas, Texas, wouldn't you?
[1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:22.880]  Because those are freaking aliens attacking us.
[1:55:22.880 --> 1:55:26.880]  Well, Klaus Schwab and the New World Order think they're going to transcend and be aliens
[1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:28.880]  with AI.
[1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:30.880]  That's what Elon Musk has met with them.
[1:55:30.880 --> 1:55:33.880]  He's warned about that, but they're on record saying that.
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:37.880]  So think of them as like aliens, folks, that are attacking and taking over other cities
[1:55:37.880 --> 1:55:38.880]  and countries.
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:41.880]  We're next.
[1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:43.880]  We're next.
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.880]  People ask you, like, Australians send us letters, handwritten ones, we get called.
[1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:48.880]  Wow, you're so nice, you care about us.
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:50.880]  Well, you're damn right I care about you.
[1:55:50.880 --> 1:55:54.880]  Freaking Klaus Schwab took your country over, he's trying to take mine over.
[1:55:54.880 --> 1:55:56.880]  I got children.
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:55:58.880]  So it's very important for everybody to get this to your head.
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:00.880]  I'm not doing this because I'm a hero.
[1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:03.880]  I'm not doing this because then people think, well, that's just what heroes do.
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:07.880]  No, it's called self-preservation.
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:10.880]  You know, if I see somebody on fire, I'm going to try to put them out,
[1:56:10.880 --> 1:56:14.880]  because that's what I want people to put me out.
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:15.880]  I'm going to go back to calls.
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:19.880]  We're going to break for two minutes and come back with Kristen,
[1:56:19.880 --> 1:56:23.880]  the Empire haulers, and everybody else straight ahead.
[1:56:23.880 --> 1:56:26.880]  Also, they want to shut everybody down.
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:29.880]  There's not many outlets that will tell the hardcore truth,
[1:56:29.880 --> 1:56:32.880]  and we're the most hardcore out there, and everybody knows it.
[1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:34.880]  By the grace of God, we've stayed on air this long,
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:36.880]  but under the Democratic Party attacks,
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:39.880]  and all the behind-the-scenes debanking and deplatforming and everything,
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:43.880]  we are mashed out on our war chests, and it has caused me massive problems
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:48.880]  just to keep this on the air, much less be able to expand in the face of this.
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:50.880]  I'd love to have reporters out covering all this,
[1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:52.880]  but we just don't have the funds for me to travel.
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:53.880]  We're all here.
[1:56:53.880 --> 1:56:55.880]  We send them out on a limited basis,
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:57.880]  because they had to build their own infrastructure,
[1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:00.880]  our own bandwidth, our own uplinks, our own everything.
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:01.880]  I'm not complaining.
[1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:02.880]  I expected to get attacked.
[1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:04.880]  I knew they'd come after us because we're the tip of the spear.
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:06.880]  I just need you to keep me in the game,
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:09.880]  so please go to infowarstore.com.

[1:57:20.880 --> 1:57:22.880]  at infowarstore.com

[1:57:25.880 --> 1:57:26.880]  and that's running through Monday.
[1:57:26.880 --> 1:57:29.880]  Prepare, get prepared, have storeable food.

[1:57:32.880 --> 1:57:34.880]  to wherever you are.
[1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:36.880]  infowarstore.com
[1:57:36.880 --> 1:57:38.880]  or triple-82533139,
[1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:41.880]  their entire food catalog, fresh and ready to ship
[1:57:41.880 --> 1:57:51.880]  right now at prepareallux.com.
[1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.880]  Coming public and whistleblowers,
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:16.880]  now their whole project is falling apart
[1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:19.880]  because the people are aware that it is
[1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:22.880]  a world government corporate takeover,
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:25.880]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:27.880]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas
[1:58:27.880 --> 1:58:29.880]  are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:58:29.880 --> 1:58:32.880]  Like Canada, where they've now declared
[1:58:32.880 --> 1:58:35.880]  a civil emergency in Marshall Law in Ontario
[1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:37.880]  and other areas of the world are following suit,
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:39.880]  like Australia.
[1:58:39.880 --> 1:58:41.880]  So pray for these folks big time,
[1:58:41.880 --> 1:58:43.880]  it's a very serious situation,
[1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:45.880]  and stay tuned to infowarstore.com
[1:58:45.880 --> 1:58:47.880]  because truth is absolutely bare-mouth.
[1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:58.880]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club,
[1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:02.880]  dear globalist leaders of the Great Reset,
[1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:04.880]  the people you're trying to step on,
[1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:06.880]  we're everyone you depend on.
[1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:08.880]  We're the people who do your laundry
[1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:10.880]  and food and serve your dinner.
[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:13.880]  We make your bed, we guard you while you're asleep,
[1:59:13.880 --> 1:59:16.880]  we drive the ambulances, we direct your call,
[1:59:16.880 --> 1:59:18.880]  we are cooks and we are taxi drivers
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:20.880]  and we know everything about you.
[1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:22.880]  We process your insurance claims
[1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:24.880]  and credit card charges.
[1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:26.880]  We control every part of your life.
[1:59:26.880 --> 1:59:28.880]  We are the middle children of history
[1:59:28.880 --> 1:59:30.880]  raised by television to believe
[1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:32.880]  that someday we'll be millionaires
[1:59:32.880 --> 1:59:34.880]  than movie stars.
[1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:37.880]  But we won't, and we're just learning this fact.
[1:59:37.880 --> 1:59:39.880]  So don't fuck with us.
[2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:13.880]  Crashing through the life and disinformation.
[2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:16.880]  It's The Alex Jones Show, taking your phone calls right now.
[2:00:16.880 --> 2:00:18.880]  Let's go to Christine in Canada.
[2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:20.880]  She was at the protest yesterday
[2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:22.880]  and will give us her report
[2:00:22.880 --> 2:00:24.880]  and got more info now from Truckers.
[2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:26.880]  Christine, thanks for calling. Tell us what you're witnessing.
[2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:30.880]  Hi, Alex. I'm a long-time listener, first-time caller.
[2:00:30.880 --> 2:00:33.880]  So we were there yesterday afternoon.
[2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:35.880]  Just want to let everyone know
[2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:38.880]  that the protest is extremely peaceful
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:40.880]  and the police are very nice.
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:43.880]  They make eye contact. They're smiling.
[2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:45.880]  I mean, you could see the smile, you know,
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:47.880]  with the mask because they're wearing masks.
[2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:50.880]  But everything is very, very calm.
[2:00:50.880 --> 2:00:53.880]  There's food for everyone.
[2:00:53.880 --> 2:00:56.880]  What they're reporting is that, you know,
[2:00:56.880 --> 2:01:00.880]  they're stopping cars from passing
[2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:03.880]  or emergency services.
[2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:05.880]  That's not true.
[2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:08.880]  Police have blocked off certain roads.
[2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:12.880]  But yesterday we had ambulance and firetrucks passing
[2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:15.880]  on one of the major roads, and there was no blockage.
[2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:17.880]  Not at all.
[2:01:17.880 --> 2:01:19.880]  And that's important because Ford's saying,
[2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:21.880]  we've got live feeds, by the way,
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:23.880]  on screen for TV viewers right now,
[2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:26.880]  at infoworks.com, Ford's last show.
[2:01:26.880 --> 2:01:28.880]  They're saying they're going to charge people
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:31.880]  under the Emergency Act, $100,000 a year in prison
[2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:34.880]  if they quote block roads. Please continue.
[2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:36.880]  Yeah, so they're not blocking roads.
[2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:38.880]  They're complying with everything.
[2:01:38.880 --> 2:01:40.880]  There's no more honking. I was there yesterday, no honking.
[2:01:40.880 --> 2:01:44.880]  They're singing the national anthem instead every hour.
[2:01:44.880 --> 2:01:46.880]  And right now as well...
[2:01:46.880 --> 2:01:48.880]  Well, that's going to upset the leftist even more.
[2:01:48.880 --> 2:01:50.880]  I mean, these are globalists.
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:53.880]  Well, what they're trying to instigate,
[2:01:53.880 --> 2:01:56.880]  you know, some kind of response.
[2:01:56.880 --> 2:01:58.880]  But the more they're doing that,
[2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:01.880]  the more love is being sent to the politicians
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:03.880]  and the police.
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:05.880]  So it's not working.
[2:02:05.880 --> 2:02:08.880]  It's probably frustrating the mayor, Jim Watson,
[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:11.880]  which, by the way, spoke at the World Economic Forum.
[2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:14.880]  So he's part of the globalist.
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.880]  Right now at 2 o'clock, Justin Trudeau
[2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:20.880]  is actually giving us a conference just to let you know.
[2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:22.880]  I don't know what he's going to be saying,
[2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:24.880]  but we'll be watching that.
[2:02:24.880 --> 2:02:26.880]  Wow, thank you.
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:29.880]  You're such a wonderful person sharing your great voice
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:31.880]  and all the concern and love that.
[2:02:31.880 --> 2:02:34.880]  It's very, very beautiful. Anything else, Kristen?
[2:02:34.880 --> 2:02:36.880]  Just to let you know, they're very organized.
[2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:39.880]  You know, there's a lot of disinfo.
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:42.880]  So people just need to watch...
[2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:44.880]  Go on YouTube.
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:46.880]  There are live feeds coming out of there.
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:48.880]  People walking, talking to people.
[2:02:48.880 --> 2:02:50.880]  That's where you're going to get the real news.
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:53.880]  And there's in particular Viva Fry,
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:59.880]  who actually has a cold YouTube channel with Robert.
[2:02:59.880 --> 2:03:02.880]  Oh, I know him. He's a lawyer. I've been on his show.
[2:03:02.880 --> 2:03:04.880]  Oh, get him on immediately, guys.
[2:03:04.880 --> 2:03:06.880]  I said we're taking calls we are,
[2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:10.880]  but get Viva Fry on the Canadian French lawyer.
[2:03:10.880 --> 2:03:13.880]  That's a really great idea. We need to do that.
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:15.880]  Thank you so much, Christine. Anything else?
[2:03:15.880 --> 2:03:17.880]  Oops, he's gone.
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:19.880]  All right, I don't want to cut Empire haulers off.
[2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:21.880]  Some stations join us during the next...
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:23.880]  Yeah, we've got his live feed right now,
[2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:26.880]  so we can just maybe go to him a little bit when we come back.
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:28.880]  Let's just go to him right now.
[2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:34.880]  Do you guys pipe the audio in?
[2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:36.880]  Well, we'll see about that a little bit later,
[2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:39.880]  but again, we're going to come back and go to Empire Hauler,
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:41.880]  Andy, Josh, Sean, Jay, and others.
[2:03:41.880 --> 2:03:44.880]  And again, if you are a trucker or one of the protesters
[2:03:44.880 --> 2:03:47.880]  or on the bridge going across from the U.S. and to Canada,
[2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:56.880]  by Detroit, we would love to hear from you at 877-789-2539-877-789-2539.
[2:03:56.880 --> 2:03:59.880]  Look, I know this all sounds crazy and it all sounds out of control.
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:02.880]  It is. The New World Order built this for decades.
[2:04:02.880 --> 2:04:04.880]  They made their move. We're in the middle of it,
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:07.880]  and they're not succeeding right now.
[2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:09.880]  They hurt us. They got a lot of power.
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:11.880]  They did a lot of terrible things. They need to be punished for it,
[2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:14.880]  but they are scared, and they should be,
[2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:17.880]  because they just couldn't help their little murderous selves.
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:19.880]  They cooked up that deadly virus, and they released it,
[2:04:19.880 --> 2:04:21.880]  and they had all the fear-mongering.
[2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:23.880]  They tried to block all the treatments,
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:27.880]  and they have just tried to swallow up our world, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:04:27.880 --> 2:04:28.880]  They tried to destroy our freedoms,
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:33.880]  but together, this is going to backfire on them like it always does.
[2:04:33.880 --> 2:04:35.880]  If good men and women do the right thing,
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:36.880]  Thomas Jefferson once asked,
[2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:39.880]  what is needed to stop tyrants?
[2:04:39.880 --> 2:04:43.880]  And he said, all that tyrants need is that good men and women do nothing.
[2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:45.880]  Well, good men and women are doing something,
[2:04:45.880 --> 2:04:48.880]  and we salute them all, the truckers and everybody else.
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.880]  You're beautiful, you're amazing, and we're praying for them.
[2:04:50.880 --> 2:05:19.880]  But back in 60 seconds, stay with us.
[2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:24.880]  I'm going to build on its ashes, their transhumanist nightmare vision,
[2:05:24.880 --> 2:05:28.880]  suppressing the voices of good people all around the world,
[2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.880]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:35.880]  that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria,
[2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:37.880]  their world's going to end in 2030,
[2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:40.880]  carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:42.880]  And none of it can succeed.
[2:05:42.880 --> 2:05:44.880]  None of it can actually be carried out
[2:05:44.880 --> 2:05:47.880]  unless everybody is silenced and gaslit.
[2:05:47.880 --> 2:05:50.880]  And that's why truth comes with hard work
[2:05:50.880 --> 2:05:52.880]  and with research and with diligence.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:55.880]  And that's why it's hard to share MFOLWARS links and BANDA video links.
[2:05:55.880 --> 2:05:58.880]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:20.880]  You are listening to an MFOLWARS.com frontline report.
[2:06:20.880 --> 2:06:36.880]  MFOLWARS.com
[2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:57.880]  Humanity is sick of the tyrants, and we will have our liberty.
[2:06:57.880 --> 2:07:08.880]  We took it for granted, but now the sleeping giant is awakening.
[2:07:08.880 --> 2:07:10.880]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:12.880]  I really, really appreciate all you tuning in today,
[2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:13.880]  and I love you.
[2:07:13.880 --> 2:07:15.880]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[2:07:15.880 --> 2:07:17.880]  The best people are involved in freedom.
[2:07:17.880 --> 2:07:20.880]  You know, I was going to say this because I was thinking about how much I hate Washington, DC,
[2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:22.880]  and how much I hate New York.
[2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:24.880]  I don't mean the people of New York.
[2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:27.880]  DC is actually a really cool town, too, with all the museums and all the big buildings.
[2:07:27.880 --> 2:07:29.880]  In fact, it's really a neat town.
[2:07:29.880 --> 2:07:31.880]  I hate the establishment that lives there.
[2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:33.880]  I hate the elites of New York.
[2:07:33.880 --> 2:07:34.880]  I hate Hollywood.
[2:07:34.880 --> 2:07:36.880]  I hate the British royalty.
[2:07:36.880 --> 2:07:38.880]  I hate all of it.
[2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:40.880]  I love the people.
[2:07:40.880 --> 2:07:44.880]  But there was a time 20 years ago when Hollywood put me in some movies without me even asking.
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:47.880]  And it wasn't really Hollywood.
[2:07:47.880 --> 2:07:49.880]  Rick Linklater is a great guy.
[2:07:49.880 --> 2:07:51.880]  But they tried to get me in other big films.
[2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:52.880]  Some other ones did.
[2:07:52.880 --> 2:07:55.880]  And it was a sellout operation, basically, part of it.
[2:07:55.880 --> 2:07:56.880]  But I didn't do it.
[2:07:56.880 --> 2:07:59.880]  And back then, I would have kind of liked to be in movies.
[2:07:59.880 --> 2:08:00.880]  Some big movies.
[2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:01.880]  Some more big movies.
[2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:04.880]  I didn't really care, and I didn't really pursue it.
[2:08:04.880 --> 2:08:11.880]  But now it makes me physically nauseous to even imagine that sick culture of fake nobodies.
[2:08:11.880 --> 2:08:16.880]  And I just think, God, I'm not with all those people that are basically already living in tombs.
[2:08:16.880 --> 2:08:18.880]  They're like mummies.
[2:08:18.880 --> 2:08:21.880]  And I just think my lucky star is that I'm amongst the living.
[2:08:21.880 --> 2:08:23.880]  That I'm amongst the people.
[2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:25.880]  And I just love you all.
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:32.880]  And seeing this attack on humanity makes me love humanity more than ever.
[2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:36.880]  And to see the children in that public school in Las Vegas, the teacher tells them,
[2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:45.880]  you can take your mask off and to see them cheering and to see how excited they got.
[2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:49.880]  And just to know we're on the right side, those masks didn't protect them.
[2:08:49.880 --> 2:08:51.880]  It was all a symbol of fear and control.
[2:08:51.880 --> 2:08:56.880]  And that this cult is made up of the very worst people that want to try to break our will and dominate.
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:08:57.880]  It's a sick.
[2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:02.880]  So here's the sound they hate, the children taking their mask off and being so happy.
[2:09:02.880 --> 2:09:07.880]  Like under Stockholm syndrome, they sat there quietly and didn't complain and were told they were all in danger.
[2:09:07.880 --> 2:09:09.880]  And they were put under this mind control.
[2:09:09.880 --> 2:09:11.880]  But now the truth is shining through.
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:13.880]  Here's this beautiful video and audio.
[2:09:13.880 --> 2:09:17.880]  Starting tomorrow, we don't have to wear masks anymore.
[2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:34.880]  They abuse those children so horribly that, you know, the sickening lining of this silver cloud.
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:37.880]  You know, a big, dark cloud will have a silver lining or the sun's behind it.
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:43.880]  But this is a beautiful, beautiful cloud of liberty with a poison lining.
[2:09:43.880 --> 2:09:49.880]  You shouldn't be, whoa, we, we submitted for years and did this and it was dumb and it was a lie.
[2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:51.880]  It's a symbol of the con game.
[2:09:51.880 --> 2:09:54.880]  Now we don't have to be slaves anymore.
[2:09:54.880 --> 2:09:55.880]  I don't blame the children.
[2:09:55.880 --> 2:09:56.880]  I love them.
[2:09:56.880 --> 2:10:02.880]  But those damn teachers, my wife's cousin, really nice lady.
[2:10:02.880 --> 2:10:07.880]  She's got five children and they had been going to this church for multi generations and had a big school there.
[2:10:07.880 --> 2:10:10.880]  That's when the schools reopened last year.
[2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:13.880]  They said, yeah, they're all going to wear a mask and they're all going to take the shots.
[2:10:13.880 --> 2:10:16.880]  They're all going to whatever, even though it wasn't for kids yet.
[2:10:16.880 --> 2:10:18.880]  And they just said, screw you.
[2:10:18.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  And about a third of the school or more left.
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:24.880]  And within a month, those parents got together, rented a nice facility.
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:27.880]  No, no, bought a nice facility that happened to be across the street.
[2:10:27.880 --> 2:10:28.880]  It wasn't on purpose.
[2:10:28.880 --> 2:10:31.880]  It was that was available and are having a great school there now.
[2:10:31.880 --> 2:10:33.880]  The answer is exodus.
[2:10:33.880 --> 2:10:34.880]  The answer is not complying.
[2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:37.880]  The answer is saying, no, I'm not owned by you.
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:39.880]  You don't own my body.
[2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:43.880]  Empire haulers in Wyoming wants to talk about the trucker convoy.
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:45.880]  I'm told big ones are forming to go into DC.
[2:10:45.880 --> 2:10:46.880]  We salute you all.
[2:10:46.880 --> 2:10:48.880]  What's your view on this?
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.880]  Well, I just had a, I had a little vision.
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:52.880]  I'm, you brought up the movies a second ago.
[2:10:52.880 --> 2:10:58.880]  I had a little vision of in Braveheart when they came out and it was William Wallace in the Irish.
[2:10:58.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  They went to scrimmage and then they stopped and they all shook hand.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:08.880]  Well, that little vision is the way I feel everybody that's in this convoy and protesting,
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:12.880]  whether you're on that side of the bridge, this side of the bridge.
[2:11:12.880 --> 2:11:17.880]  If we've reached out to our brothers or sisters or neighbors that are the police,
[2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:21.880]  that are in National Guard, that are RCMP.
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:22.880]  Hold on.
[2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:23.880]  Let me stop you.
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:24.880]  I'll give you all the time you niggas.
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:28.880]  You're so on target in that great movie Braveheart based on true events that happened.
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:33.880]  In the movie, the British King, he's not really a British King, the Norman King.
[2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:38.880]  He hires an Irish army to come attack the Scots.
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:42.880]  So the Irish take the money, show up and then join the Scots,
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:45.880]  which really happened to fight the British.
[2:11:45.880 --> 2:11:46.880]  So that's a true story.
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:50.880]  And that's what you're expecting when the convoys meet and more and more the police,
[2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.880]  like the Irish, they're paid by the crown,
[2:11:52.880 --> 2:11:54.880]  but they're going to end up joining the people is what you're saying.
[2:11:54.880 --> 2:11:55.880]  Yeah.
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:57.880]  Well, I'd say that's what we should do.
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:02.880]  So now before it happens, it's the time for everybody to reach out to their fellow brother
[2:12:02.880 --> 2:12:05.880]  and neighbor and human beings and make that happen.
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:07.880]  That's the way it should go.
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:09.880]  And actually, I'm a Guthrie.
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:11.880]  We fought, we traced our family history.
[2:12:11.880 --> 2:12:15.880]  We fought on the side of William Wallace for freedom back then.
[2:12:15.880 --> 2:12:18.880]  So I have it in my blood to feel this way.
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:25.880]  But I think the time before whatever the prime minister or their premier or whatever,
[2:12:25.880 --> 2:12:29.880]  is it before anything happens, reach out and make the connection now
[2:12:29.880 --> 2:12:35.880]  before there's any negativity, any lives lost, any hatred.
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:40.880]  It's the time to bridge that gap now because those people, you know, they all feel the same way.
[2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:41.880]  Well, that's beautifully said.
[2:12:41.880 --> 2:12:42.880]  But I want to be clear.
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:43.880]  They started this war.
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:45.880]  They killed 40 million people with starvation.
[2:12:45.880 --> 2:12:48.880]  They caused millions to commit suicide or die in drug overdoses.
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:50.880]  We're peacefully doing this.
[2:12:50.880 --> 2:12:54.880]  So if they false flag or do a car bomb or shoot some cops, we know we didn't do it.
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:12:56.880]  And we're not buying into it.
[2:12:56.880 --> 2:12:58.880]  We're not apologizing for whatever happens because they started this.
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:01.880]  Whatever happens, no more apologies.
[2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:04.880]  Not by me, by Joe Rogan, by nobody.
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:06.880]  I pledge to you, no more apologies.
[2:13:06.880 --> 2:13:07.880]  Nope.
[2:13:07.880 --> 2:13:09.880]  I'm with your brother.
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:10.880]  I appreciate you.
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:12.880]  And God bless you, my friend.
[2:13:12.880 --> 2:13:13.880]  And, you know, Joe came out.
[2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:14.880]  I didn't know I was at a secret show.
[2:13:14.880 --> 2:13:16.880]  He invited me to Sunday night.
[2:13:16.880 --> 2:13:21.880]  It was in Hollywood Reporter and stuff that was a secret comedy show he did.
[2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:26.880]  He did another one Tuesday night and said, you know, he told you what I said on Monday.
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:30.880]  He said to everybody, he said, I am not apologizing to the big corporations.
[2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:33.880]  Everybody wants to take me off the air just because they're jealous.
[2:13:33.880 --> 2:13:38.880]  I'm apologizing for using the n-word because if you watch that edited tape, it's hurtful the way they edited it.
[2:13:38.880 --> 2:13:42.880]  And I'm saying if people think I was doing that to be mean, I apologize.
[2:13:42.880 --> 2:13:44.880]  I didn't do that to hurt people.
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:46.880]  That is not an apology.
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:50.880]  That is a clarification to say, hey, I watched that.
[2:13:50.880 --> 2:13:52.880]  It was a horrible tape the way they edited it.
[2:13:52.880 --> 2:13:55.880]  And so if that hurt your feelings, I'm sorry.
[2:13:55.880 --> 2:13:57.880]  If you're legitimately, your feelings are hurt.
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:13:58.880]  Because, I mean, you do watch it.
[2:13:58.880 --> 2:14:02.880]  It's a little exorbitant, you know, three minutes of the n-word over and over again.
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:06.880]  Because I don't like words to hurt a class of people.
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:12.880]  I mean, I grew up where I never heard in East Texas, which is the south, people use the n-word.
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:20.880]  Because we're Christians and anybody that uses that's trashy and is trying to put somebody down to feel bigger about yourself.
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:24.880]  Well, I'm not trying to put down common people, whether they be black or white.
[2:14:24.880 --> 2:14:30.880]  But then when it becomes a weaponized word, people need to take it back and use it.
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:33.880]  And that just happened with a big UFC fighter, a black UFC fighter.
[2:14:33.880 --> 2:14:35.880]  And he said, you know, Joe Rogan's my n-word.
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:40.880]  And I'm sick of this crap because he understands they're using it to divide people and to control people.
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:42.880]  And it's a load of crap.
[2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:46.880]  If somebody legitimately comes up and says, you're such and such, we'll screw them.
[2:14:46.880 --> 2:14:50.880]  People, I've been called plenty of times by racist black people, cracker head and all this other stuff.
[2:14:50.880 --> 2:14:52.880]  And I mean, I started laughing.
[2:14:52.880 --> 2:14:54.880]  Well, you got some racist black person.
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:14:56.880]  I'm supposed to, because they're calling me a name.
[2:14:56.880 --> 2:14:58.880]  I'm supposed to get all pissed off about that.
[2:14:58.880 --> 2:15:00.880]  It's, I don't know.
[2:15:00.880 --> 2:15:03.880]  I always just grew up that name calling didn't matter to me.
[2:15:03.880 --> 2:15:08.880]  I mean, I remember being like going to public school the first few years.
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:10.880]  And I went to private school for years.
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:13.880]  I remember coming back in like sixth grade to public school.
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:17.880]  And some of the flunky kids were like making fun of my shirt.
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:22.880]  It was like pink and green kind of plaid shirt my mom would give me.
[2:15:22.880 --> 2:15:25.880]  I forget the name we call it, where it's pink and orange and red squares.
[2:15:25.880 --> 2:15:28.880]  And it's like a summertime or spring shirt.
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:32.880]  They were like, look at his, look at his weenie, look at his wimpy shirt.
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:35.880]  And I remember thinking, my mom got me this shirt.
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:36.880]  I like this shirt.
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:37.880]  I'm not embarrassed and laughing at them.
[2:15:37.880 --> 2:15:38.880]  And they started laughing too.
[2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:40.880]  But I mean, I guess that's just how I am.
[2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:43.880]  I don't mind being attacked because it doesn't mean anything to me.
[2:15:43.880 --> 2:15:48.880]  But at the same time, Joe was simply saying, if something hurts your feelings,
[2:15:48.880 --> 2:15:50.880]  that's okay.
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:15:54.880]  I'm sorry that this hurt you, but he's not sorry for what he said.
[2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:23.880]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:16:24.880 --> 2:16:31.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:54.880 --> 2:17:20.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:46.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:17:46.880 --> 2:17:53.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:42.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:18:42.880 --> 2:18:57.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:38.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:20:05.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:05.880 --> 2:20:26.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:26.880 --> 2:20:54.880]  We'll be right back.
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:21:00.880]  We're going to get to all the callers that are holding Jay in Ohio and Josh in Canada
[2:21:00.880 --> 2:21:05.880]  and Seth and Andy and Clayton and David in the order that they're received.
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  But I've got to go ahead and hit this.
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:09.880]  This was already in my stack, but now there's been new developments.
[2:21:09.880 --> 2:21:14.880]  So here we are.
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:19.880]  Joe Biden already said, quote, in an interview today that aired today,
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:25.880]  that's a world war and a Biden tells America to leave Ukraine,
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:30.880]  shoots down reports of evacuation and says we're in a war with Russia.
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:36.880]  And that's pretty sensational, but he has a lot of trouble talking.
[2:21:36.880 --> 2:21:42.880]  And so I thought, well, you know, but now they've made it official.
[2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:47.880]  The State Department, Jake Sullivan, boy, I'll tell you about the lies that guy's told
[2:21:47.880 --> 2:21:51.880]  on every front about Russia gate and about Afghanistan.
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:56.880]  Russia could choose in very short order to commence a major military action against Ukraine.
[2:21:56.880 --> 2:21:59.880]  He goes on to say within 48 hours.
[2:21:59.880 --> 2:22:02.880]  Now, remember two weeks ago, they said Russia's going to attack imminent.
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:08.880]  And then Bloomberg announced a week later that Russia had indeed invaded.
[2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:12.880]  It was not true.
[2:22:12.880 --> 2:22:15.880]  Now, if you put this together with all the other pieces that would take an hour to go through,
[2:22:15.880 --> 2:22:19.880]  I'm just going to give you the answer from my view rather than rattle off all of why I think that,
[2:22:19.880 --> 2:22:22.880]  because it would take the whole show, what we've got left.
[2:22:22.880 --> 2:22:30.880]  But here's one big slice of the equation of why we know this and why this is so bad and so horrible.
[2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:34.880]  It even has me having an anxiety attack right now because I love my children.
[2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:36.880]  I love peace. I love justice.
[2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:40.880]  And if you think they're just going to let us beat them on this whole lockdown thing and go away,
[2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:42.880]  you're crazy, they're going to start a damn war.
[2:22:42.880 --> 2:22:45.880]  I just cannot believe we're this cursed. My God.
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:51.880]  Sorry. Oh, my God, these people make me sick.
[2:22:51.880 --> 2:22:57.880]  Obviously, ladies and gentlemen, when they say Russia is going to attack itself in a false flag,
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:03.880]  with the history and all the background we know, that means the globalists are going to attack the Russians.
[2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:08.880]  And when the Russians show footage they were attacked, the media is going to say it didn't happen.
[2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:12.880]  It's a new gaslighting upside down world we've seen from these people.
[2:23:12.880 --> 2:23:16.880]  That's the only reason you'd say Russia is going to stage a false flag and start a war.
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:21.880]  When Russia has been 100% clear and under Putin, he's been very clear about the things he wants.
[2:23:21.880 --> 2:23:26.880]  You can agree whether or disagree that Putin is a straight shooter when it comes to detente,
[2:23:26.880 --> 2:23:28.880]  to international relations.
[2:23:28.880 --> 2:23:31.880]  He says what he wants, very cut and dry.
[2:23:31.880 --> 2:23:33.880]  We do not want Ukraine to join NATO.
[2:23:33.880 --> 2:23:40.880]  We want you to stop putting troops and high-tech A-class weapons into that theater.
[2:23:40.880 --> 2:23:44.880]  And the State Department responded by shipping in hundreds of anti-aircraft missiles,
[2:23:44.880 --> 2:23:47.880]  hundreds of anti-tank missiles just last month.
[2:23:47.880 --> 2:23:51.880]  So, here's more statements.
[2:23:51.880 --> 2:23:58.880]  U.S. officials anticipate a horribly bloody campaign that begins with two days of aerial bombardment
[2:23:58.880 --> 2:24:04.880]  with electronic warfare followed by an invasion with these possible goals of regime change.
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:07.880]  Now, Putin has told the Russians they're not going in,
[2:24:07.880 --> 2:24:13.880]  but that the U.S. and NATO are massing troops on their border in Poland, in other areas and in Ukraine.
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:17.880]  So, they have to put troops on their border because the globalists are massing troops.
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:21.880]  They're the aggressor.
[2:24:21.880 --> 2:24:24.880]  Russia already controls the pipelines that they built coming in.
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:25.880]  They've already got the black seat.
[2:24:25.880 --> 2:24:27.880]  They don't need the rest of Ukraine.
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:29.880]  They don't want it. They've got plenty of land.
[2:24:29.880 --> 2:24:33.880]  Their real strategic aims are clear.
[2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:35.880]  Economic development of Russia.
[2:24:35.880 --> 2:24:38.880]  No more Soviet Empire.
[2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:44.880]  And so, the magnitude of this is just stunning.
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:46.880]  But look at everything else.
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:51.880]  Devaluations of currencies, civil emergencies, lockdowns, forced inoculations.
[2:24:51.880 --> 2:24:54.880]  You're in the New World Order now.
[2:24:54.880 --> 2:24:58.880]  You know that old Johnny Cash song? That guy's trying to find it. It's on the computer.
[2:24:58.880 --> 2:25:01.880]  He's in the jailhouse now. You're in the jailhouse now.
[2:25:01.880 --> 2:25:05.880]  Well, you're in the New World Order now, and so am I.
[2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:11.880]  And what did I tell you back in November, October, and before that?
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:14.880]  Hell, that was in August.
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:16.880]  I was sitting there.
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:20.880]  I'm not going to get into the whole story, but I was told by multiple high-level sources,
[2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:26.880]  as high level as it gets in the military and in corporate world,
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:33.880]  I mean, the top that they were told January, February, all out war with Russia.
[2:25:33.880 --> 2:25:36.880]  Because all the big guys get prepositioned.
[2:25:36.880 --> 2:25:38.880]  You think Congress is involved in insider trading?
[2:25:38.880 --> 2:25:41.880]  They get stuff, you know, way later, okay?
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:46.880]  So, that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:25:46.880 --> 2:25:52.880]  I hope Joe Scowze is right. I hope nothing happens here, but imagine the Russians get attacked,
[2:25:52.880 --> 2:25:55.880]  and then it's just the default they're lying.
[2:25:55.880 --> 2:25:57.880]  No, no, you attacked yourself.
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:01.880]  We should not just believe the Russians. We should want to see proof.
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:04.880]  We should have international observers there.
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:09.880]  Oh, but Biden's telling everybody to get out of there. That's right.
[2:26:09.880 --> 2:26:11.880]  They don't want observers there.
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:18.880]  So, let's just play Jake Sullivan from the State Department first, and then we'll just go right into Biden with Lester Holt.
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:19.880]  Here it is.
[2:26:19.880 --> 2:26:21.880]  I want to be crystal clear, though.
[2:26:21.880 --> 2:26:23.880]  We are not saying that a decision has been taken.
[2:26:23.880 --> 2:26:26.880]  A final decision has been taken by President Putin.
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:31.880]  What we are saying is that we have a sufficient level of concern based on what we are seeing on the ground
[2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:37.880]  and what our intelligence analysts have picked up that we are sending this clear message.
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:40.880]  And it remains a message that we have now been sending for some time.
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:44.880]  And it is, yes, it is an urgent message because we are in an urgent situation.
[2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:52.880]  Just to clarify, so you now believe that Russia has all the forces it needs to mount a full-scale invasion of Ukraine?
[2:26:52.880 --> 2:26:58.880]  What I'm saying is that Russia has all the forces it needs to conduct a major military action.
[2:26:58.880 --> 2:27:01.880]  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by, quote, full-scale invasion,
[2:27:01.880 --> 2:27:08.880]  but Russia could choose, in very short order, to commence a major military action against Ukraine.
[2:27:08.880 --> 2:27:12.880]  And I asked about the tense standoff with Russia over Ukraine.
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:19.880]  What are your plans toward American citizens who are in Ukraine and might be there during an invasion?
[2:27:19.880 --> 2:27:24.880]  What scenarios would you put American troops to rescue and get Americans out?
[2:27:24.880 --> 2:27:25.880]  There's not.
[2:27:25.880 --> 2:27:29.880]  That's a world war when Americans and Russians start shooting at one another.
[2:27:29.880 --> 2:27:31.880]  We're in a very different world than we've ever been in.
[2:27:31.880 --> 2:27:34.880]  Not even on behalf of simply evacuating Americans?
[2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:35.880]  No.
[2:27:35.880 --> 2:27:36.880]  How do you do that?
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:37.880]  How do you even find them?
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:41.880]  This is not like I'm hoping that if, in fact, he's foolish enough to go in,
[2:27:41.880 --> 2:27:47.880]  he's smart enough not to, in fact, do anything that would negatively impact on American citizens.
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:48.880]  Have you told him that?
[2:27:48.880 --> 2:27:50.880]  Yes.
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:57.880]  You've told him that Americans will be aligned, that they can't cross?
[2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:00.880]  Well, I didn't have to tell him that.
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:01.880]  I've spoken about that.
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  He knows that.
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:08.880]  And, you know, it's a little bit, look, that's what, what I've asked is,
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:11.880]  American citizens should leave, should leave now.
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:14.880]  We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world.
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:18.880]  This is a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:25.880]  Oh, boy.
[2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:34.880]  I tell you, they really want war and they're going to launch a false flag.
[2:28:36.880 --> 2:28:38.880]  You're in the new world order now.
[2:28:38.880 --> 2:28:40.880]  You're in a nuclear war now.
[2:28:40.880 --> 2:28:45.880]  We'll be right back with your phone call. Stay with us.

[2:31:51.880 --> 2:32:03.880]  We here at Info Wars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava root supplement
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:06.880]  that is now available at infowarstore.com.
[2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:10.880]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today,
[2:32:10.880 --> 2:32:14.880]  though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands
[2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:17.880]  for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:22.880]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[2:32:22.880 --> 2:32:27.880]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[2:32:27.880 --> 2:32:33.880]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[2:32:33.880 --> 2:32:38.880]  Nowadays, Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[2:32:38.880 --> 2:32:43.880]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava,
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:50.880]  but other herbs including, but not limited to, German Comma Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Valerian root.
[2:32:50.880 --> 2:32:58.880]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[2:32:58.880 --> 2:33:14.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:29.880 --> 2:33:38.880]  Armored vehicles, paramilitary and French military to suppress their people for the first time
[2:33:38.880 --> 2:33:46.880]  since the Nazi occupation in 1940 are now occupying the nation ahead of the truckers
[2:33:46.880 --> 2:33:52.880]  who simply want their country back from the biomedical tyranny of the New World Order.
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:59.880]  All over the world, it is the truckers yet again hardworking men and women saying no,
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:01.880]  that scare the corrupt globalists so much.
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:05.880]  And let's talk to some of those amazing truckers right now.
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:09.880]  Holding the longest would be Jay in Ohio, a trucker on the COVID madness.
[2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:10.880]  Go ahead, Jay.
[2:34:10.880 --> 2:34:12.880]  Good afternoon, sir.
[2:34:12.880 --> 2:34:14.880]  Thank you, sir.
[2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:24.880]  Shout out to a friend of mine, my wife Renee Charlie and Jamal, a couple woke people to your program.
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:32.880]  And I walk around with my info wars gear on all the time and wherever I go,
[2:34:32.880 --> 2:34:38.880]  I feel a little less alone because people recognize it and I speak with a lot of people.
[2:34:38.880 --> 2:34:42.880]  I'm up in Ohio and I was in a lounge with another driver
[2:34:42.880 --> 2:34:44.880]  and we were listening to your show.
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:47.880]  He didn't know where you were and he hadn't heard.
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:48.880]  He's 74.
[2:34:48.880 --> 2:34:53.880]  He's from California and he said that he'd been hit twice with that shot.
[2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:56.880]  And he's got a slight cough.
[2:34:56.880 --> 2:35:01.880]  I'm not saying that it's from the spike proteins there or whatever.
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:06.880]  And I've known people that have died from taking that shot
[2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:10.880]  and including a dispatcher that works where I work.
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:11.880]  Wow.
[2:35:11.880 --> 2:35:15.880]  But the groceries that I bought from your program,
[2:35:15.880 --> 2:35:19.880]  make sure people know that to buy it with the meat and the chicken.
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:22.880]  Otherwise, they get the one without the meat and the chicken.
[2:35:22.880 --> 2:35:24.880]  But it's all good.
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:26.880]  I've eaten it on the truck and it's pretty good.
[2:35:26.880 --> 2:35:29.880]  Well, yeah, that's the great part about the storeable food we sell
[2:35:29.880 --> 2:35:30.880]  is for the price.
[2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:31.880]  You're not going to get better.
[2:35:31.880 --> 2:35:32.880]  It's what I have for my family.
[2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:37.880]  And we routinely take it camping or whatever and just eat it as regular food.
[2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:40.880]  When the power was out for over a week last year here at the office,
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:45.880]  we just put out big hot plates and just cooked it here with gas.
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:46.880]  It's pretty good.
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:50.880]  And there's a lot of things I could talk about.
[2:35:50.880 --> 2:35:54.880]  I really enjoyed listening to Kyle, the brother there of Trudeau.
[2:35:54.880 --> 2:35:57.880]  And I've been listening to you for a long time.
[2:35:57.880 --> 2:36:03.880]  And I don't get through to you very often, but I speak to Harrison and Owen occasionally.
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:11.880]  But I guess a friend of mine, David, just came out of Canada.
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:13.880]  He's a tanking anchor.
[2:36:13.880 --> 2:36:17.880]  And he said he didn't really have too much trouble coming out of this.
[2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:20.880]  Sounds like there's a lot of respect up there.
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:26.880]  People aren't really stopping you if you want to get going, which is good.
[2:36:26.880 --> 2:36:27.880]  Absolutely.
[2:36:27.880 --> 2:36:29.880]  We heard a bunch of tyranny from the politicians,
[2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:33.880]  all got paid off by Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, but the cops themselves realize
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:35.880]  this is their future being destroyed as well.
[2:36:35.880 --> 2:36:36.880]  God bless you, Jay.
[2:36:36.880 --> 2:36:37.880]  Beautiful call.
[2:36:37.880 --> 2:36:38.880]  Beautiful things you're doing.
[2:36:38.880 --> 2:36:39.880]  Thank you for the support.
[2:36:39.880 --> 2:36:40.880]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:42.880]  You're changing the world.
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:44.880]  Let's go to Josh in Canada.
[2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:45.880]  Josh, you're on the air.
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:46.880]  Welcome.
[2:36:46.880 --> 2:36:48.880]  Thanks for having me, Alec.
[2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:49.880]  I'm from Ottawa.
[2:36:49.880 --> 2:36:52.880]  I've been at the protest the last few weeks.
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:56.880]  And, you know, seeing that video you showed with the kids,
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:00.880]  it really inspired me because at the end of the day,
[2:37:00.880 --> 2:37:02.880]  this is who we are doing it for.
[2:37:02.880 --> 2:37:06.880]  This is why, you know, I go to these protests for the kids.
[2:37:06.880 --> 2:37:09.880]  So, yeah, that was just an awesome video.
[2:37:09.880 --> 2:37:14.880]  And, yeah, the protests have been absolutely beautiful.
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:17.880]  I've even seen a few Info Wars flags there, too.
[2:37:17.880 --> 2:37:19.880]  So, you know, people love you here, Alex.
[2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:21.880]  They love watching your program.
[2:37:21.880 --> 2:37:24.880]  So just know that people are listening to you.
[2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:26.880]  What do you make of the claims?
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:28.880]  Well, you appreciate you and we love you guys.
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:30.880]  What do you make of the claims for these tyrants?
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:32.880]  They're going to try to put people in jail
[2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:34.880]  and that you're blocking ambulances and all this bull.
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:35.880]  You know what?
[2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:39.880]  I honestly don't care at all, you know.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:41.880]  We've got to be fearless in this time right now.
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:45.880]  You know, we don't wrestle against flesh and blood,
[2:37:45.880 --> 2:37:48.880]  but against principalities, against powers,
[2:37:48.880 --> 2:37:52.880]  against the rulers of the darkness of the stage, you know.
[2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:54.880]  I don't fear at all.
[2:37:54.880 --> 2:37:56.880]  If I get arrested on Saturday, so be it.
[2:37:56.880 --> 2:37:58.880]  I'm doing this for freedom at the end of the day,
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:00.880]  so I don't care at all.
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:01.880]  You're right.
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:04.880]  And everybody's been calling in with that quote.
[2:38:04.880 --> 2:38:06.880]  I want to make a t-shirt that says,
[2:38:06.880 --> 2:38:08.880]  we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:10.880]  but against principalities, against powers,
[2:38:10.880 --> 2:38:12.880]  against the rulers of darkness of this world,
[2:38:12.880 --> 2:38:14.880]  against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:18.880]  I want that on the back and then Ephesians and above it.
[2:38:18.880 --> 2:38:20.880]  You know, join the Resistance InfoWars.com
[2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:22.880]  because this is a spiritual fight.
[2:38:22.880 --> 2:38:24.880]  None of this makes sense until you realize
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:27.880]  that the people serving this are literally
[2:38:27.880 --> 2:38:29.880]  demonically inspired.
[2:38:29.880 --> 2:38:31.880]  You look at Governor Whitmer of Michigan,
[2:38:31.880 --> 2:38:33.880]  she looks like a freaking jack-o'-lantern.
[2:38:33.880 --> 2:38:35.880]  She doesn't just act like one.
[2:38:35.880 --> 2:38:38.880]  You can look at her and see that is a demon.
[2:38:41.880 --> 2:38:43.880]  Anything else, Josh?
[2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:46.880]  Yeah, you know, the truckers are heroes and everything,
[2:38:46.880 --> 2:38:49.880]  but true freedom comes in Christ.
[2:38:49.880 --> 2:38:50.880]  Just remember that.
[2:38:50.880 --> 2:38:51.880]  So God bless you, Alex.
[2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:52.880]  Thanks for having me on the show.
[2:38:52.880 --> 2:38:53.880]  Thank you.
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:54.880]  Absolutely.
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:55.880]  Christ is everything, folks.
[2:38:55.880 --> 2:38:56.880]  It's real.
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:38:57.880]  They hate God.
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:38:58.880]  They hate Jesus.
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:38:59.880]  That's how you know it's real.
[2:38:59.880 --> 2:39:00.880]  All over the world throughout history,
[2:39:00.880 --> 2:39:01.880]  they hate Christians.
[2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:02.880]  And who's going to oppose their mark
[2:39:02.880 --> 2:39:03.880]  of the beast world government?
[2:39:03.880 --> 2:39:04.880]  Christians.
[2:39:04.880 --> 2:39:06.880]  And there's two and a half billion of us.
[2:39:06.880 --> 2:39:07.880]  We are going to go through this.
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:10.880]  We're going to have a toe-to-toe battle
[2:39:10.880 --> 2:39:12.880]  with the Satan's minions.
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:15.880]  It says, off-world, programming people,
[2:39:15.880 --> 2:39:17.880]  interdimensionally, you can't see it,
[2:39:17.880 --> 2:39:19.880]  but you can't see hardly anything
[2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:21.880]  of the full spectrum of reality.
[2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:22.880]  And they're here, folks.
[2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:26.880]  There's God that made the universe.
[2:39:26.880 --> 2:39:28.880]  There's God's angels, God's servants.
[2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:30.880]  And then there's the bad guys.
[2:39:30.880 --> 2:39:32.880]  That's what we're dealing with, folks.
[2:39:32.880 --> 2:39:34.880]  And they want to hurt people.
[2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:36.880]  They see you as an enemy.
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:39.880]  They're an enemy military that has to interdimensionally
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:41.880]  get you to kill yourself or hurt yourself
[2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:43.880]  or chop your child's genitals off.
[2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:44.880]  Like, who would come up with that?
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:45.880]  Well, read the Bible.
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:46.880]  That's demons.
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  I mean, they want to hurt our boys and girls.
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:52.880]  It's all about hurting our children
[2:39:52.880 --> 2:39:55.880]  because they see that, they have that rage
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:57.880]  because there's a potential in the child to do anything
[2:39:57.880 --> 2:39:59.880]  to build a whole new universe.
[2:39:59.880 --> 2:40:00.880]  I mean, we're made the image of God.
[2:40:00.880 --> 2:40:03.880]  And they see that, and they're like, oh, my gosh,
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:05.880]  we don't like something made in the image of the Creator.
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:07.880]  We're not this powerful, but we're older
[2:40:07.880 --> 2:40:10.880]  and we have knowledge that we're going to manipulate
[2:40:10.880 --> 2:40:13.880]  and twist this person, this spirit, into joining us.
[2:40:13.880 --> 2:40:15.880]  It's the ultimate sick joke.
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:18.880]  We've got to lead our children to the light, folks,
[2:40:18.880 --> 2:40:20.880]  away from the darkness.
[2:40:20.880 --> 2:40:22.880]  Let's come in with the high women.
[2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:23.880]  I'm going to live forever.
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:25.880]  I'm going to cross that river.
[2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:27.880]  I'm going to...
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:29.880]  All right, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[2:40:29.880 --> 2:40:30.880]  Who's been home the longest here?
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:33.880]  That would be Andy and Main, a trucker,
[2:40:33.880 --> 2:40:36.880]  right up there by Canada, on the convoy drivers
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:38.880]  and calling on company drivers.
[2:40:38.880 --> 2:40:40.880]  Tell us what that means.
[2:40:40.880 --> 2:40:41.880]  Okay.
[2:40:41.880 --> 2:40:42.880]  Hey, Alex.
[2:40:42.880 --> 2:40:43.880]  I know what a company driver is.
[2:40:43.880 --> 2:40:44.880]  That's a bigger company.
[2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:48.880]  Well, actually, what you have are you have owner operators.
[2:40:48.880 --> 2:40:50.880]  Those are people who own their trucks
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:52.880]  and pretty much have their freedom to go where they want.
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:56.880]  Most of your convoy drivers for these protests
[2:40:56.880 --> 2:40:58.880]  are going to be owner operators.
[2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:01.880]  But the majority of the drivers that we have out there
[2:41:01.880 --> 2:41:03.880]  are company drivers, which means that they drive
[2:41:03.880 --> 2:41:05.880]  for another company.
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:11.880]  They're freelancers who are employees of large trucking companies
[2:41:11.880 --> 2:41:13.880]  and they just don't have the freedom to go out
[2:41:13.880 --> 2:41:15.880]  and they don't have their own truck.
[2:41:15.880 --> 2:41:17.880]  They don't have the freedom to go to a protest
[2:41:17.880 --> 2:41:21.880]  or go to a convoy because they work for somebody.
[2:41:21.880 --> 2:41:25.880]  But my suggestion is I actually put up a Facebook page
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:27.880]  called Honk Your Freedom.
[2:41:27.880 --> 2:41:30.880]  And what I'm suggesting is that all company drivers,
[2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:34.880]  and for that matter, even car drivers,
[2:41:34.880 --> 2:41:39.880]  at 8 o'clock in the morning, at noon, at 8 o'clock at night,
[2:41:39.880 --> 2:41:43.880]  wherever you are in the world at those times,
[2:41:43.880 --> 2:41:45.880]  lay on your horn for straight 10 seconds
[2:41:45.880 --> 2:41:47.880]  in support of the convoy drivers.
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:49.880]  Because I know I for one am a company driver
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:51.880]  and I don't have the option to take off
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:55.880]  with somebody else's truck and drive at a convoy.
[2:41:55.880 --> 2:41:57.880]  So I can do that.
[2:41:57.880 --> 2:42:00.880]  And 10 seconds for an air horn is a long time.
[2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:02.880]  When you're doing it, you're like,
[2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:05.880]  oh my gosh, these 10 seconds are a long 10 seconds.
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:09.880]  But if we can get all the truck drivers out there
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:12.880]  who are our company drivers, who do support this,
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:15.880]  and car drivers, just if you support this cause
[2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:18.880]  at 8 o'clock in the morning, at noon,
[2:42:18.880 --> 2:42:21.880]  at an 8 o'clock at night, if you're on the road,
[2:42:21.880 --> 2:42:24.880]  just lay on your horn for straight 10 seconds
[2:42:24.880 --> 2:42:26.880]  and show your support for these convoy drivers.
[2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:30.880]  We can call it 8-12-8, and I totally agree with you
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:32.880]  just to show our power and our solidarity
[2:42:32.880 --> 2:42:35.880]  and also make a banner if you're a truck driver
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:37.880]  and stop by an overpass where it's good,
[2:42:37.880 --> 2:42:39.880]  hang the banner up and leave,
[2:42:39.880 --> 2:42:42.880]  and when you come back in a few days from your hall,
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:45.880]  you can take it back down if it's still up.
[2:42:45.880 --> 2:42:48.880]  All of these things are having a massive effect of solidarity
[2:42:48.880 --> 2:42:51.880]  to let others know that they're not alone.
[2:42:51.880 --> 2:42:53.880]  Beautifully said, Andy. Thank you so much,
[2:42:53.880 --> 2:42:55.880]  and God bless you. We'll be right back.
[2:42:57.880 --> 2:42:59.880]  The Globalist Social Inciniers
[2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:04.880]  always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny
[2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:08.880]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled.
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:10.880]  They would then use that as the pretext
[2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:13.880]  for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[2:43:13.880 --> 2:43:17.880]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[2:43:17.880 --> 2:43:19.880]  But because of so many scientists and engineers
[2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:22.880]  and researchers and others coming public
[2:43:22.880 --> 2:43:26.880]  and whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart
[2:43:26.880 --> 2:43:29.880]  because the people are aware that it is
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:32.880]  a world government corporate takeover.
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:35.880]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[2:43:35.880 --> 2:43:37.880]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas
[2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:40.880]  are not going to give up on their takeover.
[2:43:40.880 --> 2:43:43.880]  Like Canada, they've now declared a civil emergency
[2:43:43.880 --> 2:43:47.880]  in martial law in Ontario and other areas of the world
[2:43:47.880 --> 2:43:49.880]  are following suit like Australia.
[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:51.880]  So pray for these folks big time.
[2:43:51.880 --> 2:43:53.880]  It's a very serious situation.

[2:46:04.880 --> 2:46:07.880]  From the words of Chuck Paulinique's Fight Club,
[2:46:07.880 --> 2:46:11.880]  dear globalist leaders of the great reset,
[2:46:11.880 --> 2:46:13.880]  the people you're trying to step on,
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:15.880]  we're everyone you depend on.
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:17.880]  We're the people who do your laundry
[2:46:17.880 --> 2:46:19.880]  and cook your food and serve your dinner.
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:20.880]  We make your bed.
[2:46:20.880 --> 2:46:22.880]  We guard you while you're asleep.
[2:46:22.880 --> 2:46:24.880]  We drive the ambulances.
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:25.880]  We direct your call.
[2:46:25.880 --> 2:46:27.880]  We are cooks and we are taxi drivers,
[2:46:27.880 --> 2:46:29.880]  and we know everything about you.
[2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:33.880]  We process your insurance claims and credit card charges.
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:35.880]  We control every part of your life.
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:37.880]  We are the middle children of history,
[2:46:37.880 --> 2:46:39.880]  raised by television to believe
[2:46:39.880 --> 2:46:43.880]  that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars.
[2:46:43.880 --> 2:46:45.880]  But we won't.
[2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:47.880]  And we're just learning this fact.
[2:46:47.880 --> 2:47:16.880]  So don't fuck with us.
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:27.880]  I'm gonna live forever.
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:29.880]  I'm gonna cross that river.
[2:47:29.880 --> 2:47:33.880]  I'm gonna catch tomorrow now.
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:36.880]  You're gonna water hold me
[2:47:36.880 --> 2:47:38.880]  just like I always told you.
[2:47:38.880 --> 2:47:42.880]  You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.
[2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:46.880]  Nobody here will ever find me.
[2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:48.880]  The globalists just think they're gonna end
[2:47:48.880 --> 2:47:50.880]  the human age and bring in the robots
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:52.880]  and serve them.
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:56.880]  But we're not gonna go so easily.
[2:47:56.880 --> 2:47:59.880]  We're not gonna let the darkness take our children.
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:03.880]  We're not gonna let them be forsaken.
[2:48:03.880 --> 2:48:05.880]  You fathers and you mothers,
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:07.880]  be good to one another.
[2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:11.880]  Please try to raise your children right.
[2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:13.880]  You fathers and you mothers,
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:15.880]  be good to one another.
[2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:20.880]  Please try to raise your children right.
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:22.880]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:24.880]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:27.880]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:28.880]  We are back live, folks.
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:29.880]  I'm Alex Jones, your host,
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:32.880]  and I appreciate Sheila Gunn-Reed joining us.
[2:48:32.880 --> 2:48:34.880]  We'll get back to your calls next hour.
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:37.880]  She is the chief reporter at the Amazing Rebel News.
[2:48:37.880 --> 2:48:38.880]  Her primary focus are government,
[2:48:38.880 --> 2:48:39.880]  accountability, civil liberties,
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:40.880]  and religious freedoms.
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:42.880]  She's on Twitter at Sheila Gunn-Reed
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:44.880]  or rebelnews.com.
[2:48:44.880 --> 2:48:46.880]  And she's been on with us several times before.
[2:48:46.880 --> 2:48:48.880]  I watch her work every week.
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:50.880]  Sheila, thanks for coming on during this epic moment.
[2:48:50.880 --> 2:48:52.880]  Who would have thought Canada criticized
[2:48:52.880 --> 2:48:55.880]  for being almost in a coma
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:57.880]  under the two years of tyranny
[2:48:57.880 --> 2:48:59.880]  as now the focus of the world
[2:48:59.880 --> 2:49:01.880]  with martial law declared in Quebec?
[2:49:01.880 --> 2:49:03.880]  Tell us the latest.
[2:49:03.880 --> 2:49:06.880]  Actually, it was Ontario today
[2:49:06.880 --> 2:49:08.880]  that just a few short hours ago
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:10.880]  in the state emergency.
[2:49:10.880 --> 2:49:12.880]  That's okay. It's the same difference.
[2:49:12.880 --> 2:49:14.880]  I'm out here in the West,
[2:49:14.880 --> 2:49:16.880]  and they may as well be all lumped together for me anyway.
[2:49:16.880 --> 2:49:18.880]  But yeah, who would have thought
[2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:20.880]  that at the beginning of this,
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:24.880]  that Canadians, passive, kind,
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:25.880]  go along to get along?
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:27.880]  Canadians would be inspiring the world
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:29.880]  in our resistance to tyranny.
[2:49:29.880 --> 2:49:31.880]  The convoy that started now
[2:49:31.880 --> 2:49:33.880]  over two weeks ago here in Canada
[2:49:33.880 --> 2:49:35.880]  has inspired convoys,
[2:49:35.880 --> 2:49:37.880]  not only all across our own country,
[2:49:37.880 --> 2:49:39.880]  but across the world.
[2:49:39.880 --> 2:49:41.880]  As far away as Australia,
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:43.880]  people are being inspired
[2:49:43.880 --> 2:49:46.880]  by this working-class uprising
[2:49:46.880 --> 2:49:47.880]  here in Canada,
[2:49:47.880 --> 2:49:49.880]  where they are telling
[2:49:49.880 --> 2:49:52.880]  our moral and intellectual superiors,
[2:49:52.880 --> 2:49:54.880]  no, it's actually us
[2:49:54.880 --> 2:49:56.880]  that makes the world go around,
[2:49:56.880 --> 2:49:57.880]  and not you.
[2:49:57.880 --> 2:49:59.880]  And I think that's really why the elites are mad
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:01.880]  at this trucker uprising.
[2:50:01.880 --> 2:50:03.880]  Wow.
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:05.880]  So what do you expect to happen next?
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:07.880]  And how is this affecting Trudeau?
[2:50:07.880 --> 2:50:09.880]  I know that the Conservative Party
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:11.880]  just had their leader removed,
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:12.880]  they were going along with it.
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:14.880]  I know that some of his own caucus
[2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:16.880]  in Trudeau's party are now turning against him.
[2:50:16.880 --> 2:50:17.880]  What's happening?
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:18.880]  Yeah.
[2:50:18.880 --> 2:50:20.880]  Yeah, so within Trudeau's caucus,
[2:50:20.880 --> 2:50:23.880]  we are starting to see it fracture this week.
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:25.880]  There are three MPs,
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:27.880]  so members of parliament from within
[2:50:27.880 --> 2:50:29.880]  Trudeau's own party
[2:50:29.880 --> 2:50:31.880]  who have come out against
[2:50:31.880 --> 2:50:33.880]  the government's handling of the lockdown.
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:35.880]  That is the first crack
[2:50:35.880 --> 2:50:37.880]  we've really ever seen
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:39.880]  on this issue
[2:50:39.880 --> 2:50:41.880]  from within Trudeau's government.
[2:50:41.880 --> 2:50:43.880]  Everybody has been falling in line
[2:50:43.880 --> 2:50:45.880]  all along.
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:47.880]  As you rightly pointed out,
[2:50:47.880 --> 2:50:49.880]  Erin O'Toole, the Conservative Party leader,
[2:50:49.880 --> 2:50:51.880]  the trucker is basically the trucker uprising
[2:50:51.880 --> 2:50:53.880]  and his lack of support for it
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:50:55.880]  forced his own party to toss him out.
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:57.880]  The truckers are receiving
[2:50:57.880 --> 2:50:59.880]  a lot of support from
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:01.880]  the now emboldened
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:03.880]  Conservative establishment.
[2:51:03.880 --> 2:51:05.880]  These truckers are
[2:51:05.880 --> 2:51:07.880]  sort of extra political.
[2:51:07.880 --> 2:51:09.880]  They don't exist within a political party.
[2:51:09.880 --> 2:51:11.880]  Really, the
[2:51:11.880 --> 2:51:13.880]  political sentiment now in Canada
[2:51:13.880 --> 2:51:15.880]  is people who want to be left alone
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:17.880]  and people who won't leave them alone,
[2:51:17.880 --> 2:51:19.880]  and this is crossing party lines.
[2:51:19.880 --> 2:51:21.880]  When you go to these protests,
[2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:23.880]  these convoys,
[2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:25.880]  these are people from all walks of life
[2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:27.880]  that are coming out, pouring out
[2:51:27.880 --> 2:51:29.880]  onto the highways
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:31.880]  to greet the truckers.
[2:51:31.880 --> 2:51:33.880]  The truckers themselves, you know,
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:35.880]  but sometimes blue-collar people
[2:51:35.880 --> 2:51:37.880]  vote for the pro-union party
[2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:39.880]  in Canada, that's the NDP.
[2:51:39.880 --> 2:51:41.880]  But
[2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:43.880]  they've been abandoned by that socialist party.
[2:51:43.880 --> 2:51:45.880]  This is
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:47.880]  a cross-partisan movement
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:49.880]  for freedom.
[2:51:49.880 --> 2:51:51.880]  Now, I'm not sure if it's going to affect
[2:51:51.880 --> 2:51:53.880]  Justin Trudeau in a way that he might step down,
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:55.880]  but it is going to, I think,
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:51:57.880]  get cross-border trucking mandates
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:51:59.880]  lifted, and that is going to come
[2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:01.880]  from the United States, because right now
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:03.880]  we're speaking.
[2:52:03.880 --> 2:52:05.880]  The Ambassador Bridge in Windsor is also
[2:52:05.880 --> 2:52:07.880]  being Windsor
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:09.880]  on the Canadian side, Detroit on the American side
[2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:11.880]  for our American friends watching.
[2:52:11.880 --> 2:52:13.880]  That's being blockaded by
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:15.880]  truckers and their supporters,
[2:52:15.880 --> 2:52:17.880]  and that is catastrophic
[2:52:17.880 --> 2:52:19.880]  for the economy right now.
[2:52:19.880 --> 2:52:21.880]  That's a quarter of all
[2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:23.880]  cross-border trade
[2:52:23.880 --> 2:52:25.880]  goes through that one bridge every single year.
[2:52:25.880 --> 2:52:27.880]  It's being blocked by truckers,
[2:52:27.880 --> 2:52:29.880]  and instead of doing
[2:52:29.880 --> 2:52:31.880]  what Justin Trudeau did and
[2:52:31.880 --> 2:52:33.880]  pick an open fight with truckers and
[2:52:33.880 --> 2:52:35.880]  call them names, racist, misogynist,
[2:52:35.880 --> 2:52:37.880]  sexist, homophobe, you name it,
[2:52:37.880 --> 2:52:39.880]  Justin Trudeau's long list of things
[2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:41.880]  he maligns his enemies with.
[2:52:41.880 --> 2:52:43.880]  Biden, to his credit,
[2:52:43.880 --> 2:52:45.880]  and I can't believe I'm saying that he seems more
[2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:47.880]  in control of his faculties than Justin Trudeau,
[2:52:47.880 --> 2:52:49.880]  he didn't pick a fight with the truckers.
[2:52:49.880 --> 2:52:51.880]  He said everybody's got
[2:52:51.880 --> 2:52:53.880]  a right to free expression
[2:52:53.880 --> 2:52:55.880]  and peaceful protest, so I think
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:52:57.880]  Biden is hoping this
[2:52:57.880 --> 2:52:59.880]  might come for me too.
[2:52:59.880 --> 2:53:01.880]  But
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:03.880]  if Biden rolls back the
[2:53:03.880 --> 2:53:05.880]  cross-border trucking vaccine mandate,
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:07.880]  Trudeau will have no choice
[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:09.880]  but to do it. So Canadian
[2:53:09.880 --> 2:53:11.880]  truckers might free American truckers,
[2:53:11.880 --> 2:53:13.880]  which will ultimately free Canadian
[2:53:13.880 --> 2:53:15.880]  truckers in the end. It's all just
[2:53:15.880 --> 2:53:17.880]  a big cascade of things happening.
[2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:19.880]  Well, exactly. I see the clips on CNN
[2:53:19.880 --> 2:53:21.880]  and they go, if we don't stop them in Canada,
[2:53:21.880 --> 2:53:23.880]  this will spread.
[2:53:23.880 --> 2:53:25.880]  They're just so tone deaf and
[2:53:25.880 --> 2:53:27.880]  aware, but just to get it straight,
[2:53:27.880 --> 2:53:29.880]  I've been up there a few times, but I always get names
[2:53:29.880 --> 2:53:31.880]  backwards. Ontario's the state
[2:53:31.880 --> 2:53:33.880]  or the province,
[2:53:33.880 --> 2:53:35.880]  and the Premier is Doug Ford, we followed
[2:53:35.880 --> 2:53:37.880]  him with a civil emergency, he announced,
[2:53:37.880 --> 2:53:39.880]  state of emergency, and then
[2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:41.880]  Ottawa's the capital that's within that state,
[2:53:41.880 --> 2:53:43.880]  and that's where the emergency's been declared.
[2:53:43.880 --> 2:53:45.880]  The emergency,
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:47.880]  the state of emergency has been declared
[2:53:47.880 --> 2:53:49.880]  in all of the province of Ontario because
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:51.880]  they're dealing with the border
[2:53:51.880 --> 2:53:53.880]  problem at Windsor and
[2:53:53.880 --> 2:53:55.880]  because the politicians are calling it
[2:53:55.880 --> 2:53:57.880]  the ongoing occupation of
[2:53:57.880 --> 2:53:59.880]  truckers in the capital
[2:53:59.880 --> 2:54:01.880]  of the country, Ottawa, that's like our DC.
[2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:03.880]  That's,
[2:54:03.880 --> 2:54:05.880]  the truckers descended there, 100,000
[2:54:05.880 --> 2:54:07.880]  truckers and their supporters
[2:54:07.880 --> 2:54:09.880]  over, we're approaching two weeks now.
[2:54:09.880 --> 2:54:11.880]  And what I find to be interesting here is, and
[2:54:11.880 --> 2:54:13.880]  here's my question to you, everything
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:15.880]  Doug Ford and Justin Trudeau
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:17.880]  and all of them say about, they've got us
[2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:19.880]  under siege, they're not letting us leave our
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:21.880]  houses, which is even true, they're hurting
[2:54:21.880 --> 2:54:23.880]  the economy, that's what they've just done to everybody
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:25.880]  for two years, so it's perfect projection
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:27.880]  in my view, what do you say to that?
[2:54:27.880 --> 2:54:29.880]  That's exactly what it is,
[2:54:29.880 --> 2:54:31.880]  you know, I listened to this Doug Ford press conference
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:33.880]  today, and he is saying
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:35.880]  the most tone deaf
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:37.880]  out of touch things, it's like
[2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:39.880]  he thinks all of us are hard of remembering.
[2:54:39.880 --> 2:54:41.880]  He said in that press conference
[2:54:41.880 --> 2:54:43.880]  that no one should obstruct
[2:54:43.880 --> 2:54:45.880]  people
[2:54:45.880 --> 2:54:47.880]  from coming and going into their own country.
[2:54:47.880 --> 2:54:49.880]  Yeah, we know,
[2:54:49.880 --> 2:54:51.880]  that's why the truckers are protesting the
[2:54:51.880 --> 2:54:53.880]  cross-border vaccine mandate,
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:55.880]  because they are being obstructed
[2:54:55.880 --> 2:54:57.880]  based on medical status
[2:54:57.880 --> 2:54:59.880]  from doing their job going
[2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:01.880]  across the border, but the politicians
[2:55:01.880 --> 2:55:03.880]  seem to forget that they
[2:55:03.880 --> 2:55:05.880]  have just been subject to two weeks
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:07.880]  to flatten the curve in Ottawa.
[2:55:07.880 --> 2:55:09.880]  And, you know, as they say
[2:55:09.880 --> 2:55:11.880]  first it was two weeks and then they needed a month
[2:55:11.880 --> 2:55:13.880]  and then they needed a month, well maybe that's what the truckers need to.
[2:55:15.880 --> 2:55:17.880]  I've been asking the questions, but you're the reporter on the
[2:55:17.880 --> 2:55:19.880]  ground, what would you call this historically
[2:55:19.880 --> 2:55:21.880]  and what do you expect to happen
[2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:23.880]  now that the civil emergency has been announced?
[2:55:23.880 --> 2:55:25.880]  I think this is the single largest civil
[2:55:25.880 --> 2:55:27.880]  rights movement to ever occur
[2:55:27.880 --> 2:55:29.880]  in Canada.
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:31.880]  This is the single largest protest that's ever occurred
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:33.880]  in Canada.
[2:55:33.880 --> 2:55:35.880]  It has forced several provinces
[2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:37.880]  all of a sudden overnight to drop
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:39.880]  their vaccine passports and rollback
[2:55:39.880 --> 2:55:41.880]  restrictions and put a timeline
[2:55:41.880 --> 2:55:43.880]  in place to drop their mask mandates.
[2:55:43.880 --> 2:55:45.880]  It has cost the
[2:55:45.880 --> 2:55:47.880]  Conservative Party, someone who wanted
[2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:49.880]  to be the next Prime Minister, it is fracturing
[2:55:49.880 --> 2:55:51.880]  the Liberal Party of Canada.
[2:55:51.880 --> 2:55:53.880]  I think though, however,
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:55.880]  we are going to see
[2:55:55.880 --> 2:55:57.880]  be cut, oh, look at that, the democracy
[2:55:57.880 --> 2:55:59.880]  fund is a, by the way, that sign
[2:55:59.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  that you're seeing there, registered Canadian charity
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:03.880]  that is providing free legal advice
[2:56:03.880 --> 2:56:05.880]  and help, legal help to the
[2:56:05.880 --> 2:56:07.880]  truckers that are currently being ticketed in Ottawa
[2:56:07.880 --> 2:56:09.880]  by the police there.
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:11.880]  But I think
[2:56:11.880 --> 2:56:13.880]  with the declared state of emergency
[2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:15.880]  that gives the government more powers to act.
[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:17.880]  And I am concerned
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:19.880]  that we will see
[2:56:19.880 --> 2:56:21.880]  some very heavy handed police
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:23.880]  enforcement happening already.
[2:56:23.880 --> 2:56:25.880]  We're seeing stuff
[2:56:25.880 --> 2:56:27.880]  that violates the basic fundamental
[2:56:27.880 --> 2:56:29.880]  tenants of people
[2:56:29.880 --> 2:56:31.880]  protesting and how you're
[2:56:31.880 --> 2:56:33.880]  supposed to protect their
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:35.880]  human rights when they protest, for example
[2:56:35.880 --> 2:56:37.880]  in Ottawa, the police
[2:56:37.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  have declared that
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:41.880]  the truckers are committing
[2:56:41.880 --> 2:56:43.880]  public mischief.
[2:56:43.880 --> 2:56:45.880]  And so if you deliver
[2:56:45.880 --> 2:56:47.880]  gas, diesel, fuel,
[2:56:47.880 --> 2:56:49.880]  food, water
[2:56:49.880 --> 2:56:51.880]  to the truckers, you are
[2:56:51.880 --> 2:56:53.880]  in accomplice to mischief.
[2:56:53.880 --> 2:56:55.880]  That's right, they're calling it
[2:56:55.880 --> 2:56:57.880]  material support. That's a terrorism term.
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:56:59.880]  Yes.
[2:56:59.880 --> 2:57:01.880]  So you're providing
[2:57:01.880 --> 2:57:03.880]  material support to people
[2:57:03.880 --> 2:57:05.880]  already committing mischief.
[2:57:05.880 --> 2:57:07.880]  They're not ticketing the truckers for mischief.
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:09.880]  They're only ticketing the people who are bringing
[2:57:09.880 --> 2:57:11.880]  the diesel to the truckers
[2:57:11.880 --> 2:57:13.880]  to stay warm. And I don't know if you know anything
[2:57:13.880 --> 2:57:15.880]  about Canadian winters, but
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:17.880]  that was minus 15 degrees
[2:57:17.880 --> 2:57:19.880]  Celsius. Brutal.
[2:57:19.880 --> 2:57:21.880]  It's pretty cold for Ottawa
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:23.880]  and they were depriving the truckers
[2:57:23.880 --> 2:57:25.880]  of the ability to keep their trucks running
[2:57:25.880 --> 2:57:27.880]  to keep them warm. That violates the Geneva Convention
[2:57:27.880 --> 2:57:29.880]  of Prisoners.
[2:57:29.880 --> 2:57:31.880]  It does. And another thing too,
[2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:33.880]  there are kids in some of these trucks.
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:35.880]  These are truckers, these are trucking families.
[2:57:35.880 --> 2:57:37.880]  They bring their kids with them.
[2:57:37.880 --> 2:57:39.880]  You can read, stay there, chief reporter
[2:57:39.880 --> 2:57:41.880]  for Rebel News. We'll do five more minutes
[2:57:41.880 --> 2:57:43.880]  to get to your calls, folks. Stay with us.
[2:57:43.880 --> 2:57:45.880]  Thanks for being here, Sheila.
[2:57:47.880 --> 2:57:49.880]  Sold out for months.
[2:57:49.880 --> 2:57:51.880]  X3 is now back in stock.
[2:57:51.880 --> 2:57:53.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information
[2:57:53.880 --> 2:57:55.880]  is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[2:57:55.880 --> 2:57:57.880]  And so many people are deficient
[2:57:57.880 --> 2:57:59.880]  in iodine.
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:01.880]  It's not the soil anymore.
[2:58:01.880 --> 2:58:03.880]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:05.880]  But when you get high quality
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:07.880]  iodine, all three of the healthy types
[2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:09.880]  together, it does amazing things
[2:58:09.880 --> 2:58:11.880]  for your stamina, your libido,
[2:58:11.880 --> 2:58:13.880]  but most importantly, your immune system.
[2:58:13.880 --> 2:58:15.880]  So, X3,
[2:58:15.880 --> 2:58:17.880]  the only tri-iodine on the market,
[2:58:17.880 --> 2:58:19.880]  highest grade, is now exclusively
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:21.880]  available again at 50% off
[2:58:21.880 --> 2:58:23.880]  at mforwardstore.com.
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:25.880]  If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine,
[2:58:25.880 --> 2:58:27.880]  and what it does for your body,
[2:58:27.880 --> 2:58:29.880]  it takes about two weeks to get on average,
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:31.880]  you really need to experience X3.
[2:58:31.880 --> 2:58:33.880]  Those of you that have tried it and used it,
[2:58:33.880 --> 2:58:35.880]  you're going to be reordering it.
[2:58:35.880 --> 2:58:37.880]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product,
[2:58:37.880 --> 2:58:39.880]  you need it because it's amazing
[2:58:39.880 --> 2:58:41.880]  what it does for your body.
[2:58:41.880 --> 2:58:43.880]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen,
[2:58:43.880 --> 2:58:45.880]  and it funds the info or a true 360 win.
[2:58:45.880 --> 2:58:47.880]  So again, X3 back in stock,
[2:58:47.880 --> 2:58:49.880]  50% off for a limited time.
[2:58:49.880 --> 2:58:51.880]  Something very rare is going on.
[2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:53.880]  And it ends in just
[2:58:53.880 --> 2:58:55.880]  three days as of the time
[2:58:55.880 --> 2:58:57.880]  I'm taping this announcement
[2:58:57.880 --> 2:58:59.880]  on Thursday afternoon.
[2:58:59.880 --> 2:59:01.880]  Coming up this Monday,
[2:59:01.880 --> 2:59:03.880]  I've failed in four years
[2:59:03.880 --> 2:59:05.880]  of high quality, storeable foods
[2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:07.880]  and preparealix.com
[2:59:07.880 --> 2:59:09.880]  will end. That's 25% off
[2:59:09.880 --> 2:59:11.880]  already the lowest prices you're going to find
[2:59:11.880 --> 2:59:13.880]  on high quality, storeable food
[2:59:13.880 --> 2:59:15.880]  at infoorstore.com.
[2:59:15.880 --> 2:59:17.880]  Again, you can go to
[2:59:17.880 --> 2:59:19.880]  preparewithalix.com
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:21.880]  or infoorstore.com
[2:59:21.880 --> 2:59:23.880]  and it takes you to
[2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:25.880]  the same place.
[2:59:25.880 --> 2:59:27.880]  50% off as well

[2:59:31.880 --> 2:59:33.880]  earth, there's still iodine.
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:35.880]  That sale is going on as well.
[2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:37.880]  It doesn't end on Monday.
[2:59:37.880 --> 2:59:39.880]  It'll end in a few weeks and we're all
[2:59:39.880 --> 2:59:41.880]  sold out of the product.
[2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:43.880]  Everybody needs to have terrible food
[2:59:43.880 --> 2:59:45.880]  to be prepared to become self-sufficient now.
[2:59:45.880 --> 2:59:47.880]  The best high quality food at the lowest prices
[2:59:47.880 --> 2:59:49.880]  at infoorstore.com
[2:59:49.880 --> 2:59:51.880]  Leading a frontal assault
[2:59:51.880 --> 2:59:53.880]  on the lies of the New World Order.
[2:59:53.880 --> 2:59:59.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:25.880]  We should try to get him on
[3:00:25.880 --> 3:00:27.880]  because he dared support the people
[3:00:27.880 --> 3:00:29.880]  and didn't want vaccine passports
[3:00:29.880 --> 3:00:31.880]  which is of course a little internal tracking
[3:00:31.880 --> 3:00:33.880]  grid.
[3:00:33.880 --> 3:00:35.880]  Finishing up with Sheila Gunn-Reed.
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:37.880]  I really appreciate her coming from Rebel News.
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:39.880]  Find her at rebelnews.com.
[3:00:39.880 --> 3:00:41.880]  Where are you sending and whether or other points
[3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:43.880]  you'd like to add that people need to know?
[3:00:43.880 --> 3:00:45.880]  You know, I think that
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:47.880]  if the Americans move to drop their
[3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:49.880]  cross-border vaccine mandate
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:51.880]  it will liberate
[3:00:51.880 --> 3:00:53.880]  Canadian truckers from that.
[3:00:53.880 --> 3:00:55.880]  That will free us.
[3:00:55.880 --> 3:00:57.880]  But I think as long as the
[3:00:57.880 --> 3:00:59.880]  truckers have the resolve
[3:00:59.880 --> 3:01:01.880]  to do what they do and they have
[3:01:01.880 --> 3:01:03.880]  the support of the Canadian public
[3:01:03.880 --> 3:01:05.880]  which by and large they do
[3:01:05.880 --> 3:01:07.880]  then things are
[3:01:07.880 --> 3:01:09.880]  going to change in Canadian
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:11.880]  provinces. Some of them faster than others
[3:01:11.880 --> 3:01:13.880]  in
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:15.880]  Alberta, Saskatchewan
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:17.880]  even
[3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:19.880]  Ontario where they declared a civil
[3:01:19.880 --> 3:01:21.880]  emergency today. They are also
[3:01:21.880 --> 3:01:23.880]  bringing in a timeline to end their
[3:01:23.880 --> 3:01:25.880]  coronavirus restrictions.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:27.880]  So the truckers are
[3:01:27.880 --> 3:01:29.880]  truly saving Canada
[3:01:29.880 --> 3:01:31.880]  from tyranny and as long as they are able
[3:01:31.880 --> 3:01:33.880]  to stay there and do what
[3:01:33.880 --> 3:01:35.880]  they're doing and as long as they have the support of the Canadian
[3:01:35.880 --> 3:01:37.880]  public, things will
[3:01:37.880 --> 3:01:39.880]  continue to change and get more free.
[3:01:41.880 --> 3:01:43.880]  Well, I gotta tell you, the whole world
[3:01:43.880 --> 3:01:45.880]  is looking at Canada and just as many predicted
[3:01:45.880 --> 3:01:47.880]  it's now mushroomed around the world.
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:49.880]  We're seeing the desperate politicians say
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:51.880]  shut them down. We have the former deputy head of
[3:01:51.880 --> 3:01:53.880]  Homeland Security, CNN host
[3:01:53.880 --> 3:01:55.880]  saying slash the tires
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:57.880]  arrest the drivers
[3:01:57.880 --> 3:01:59.880]  take the gas and then move the trucks.
[3:01:59.880 --> 3:02:01.880]  If you can move the trucks once you've slashed the tires
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:03.880]  and taken the gas.
[3:02:03.880 --> 3:02:05.880]  I love all these people that have never been in the military
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:07.880]  or probably ever in a fist fight
[3:02:07.880 --> 3:02:09.880]  left us commanding the police
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:11.880]  to go out and start a war.
[3:02:11.880 --> 3:02:13.880]  I just love it because they don't know what they're talking about.
[3:02:13.880 --> 3:02:15.880]  Yeah, I mean
[3:02:15.880 --> 3:02:17.880]  that's really
[3:02:17.880 --> 3:02:19.880]  I think the overarching thing
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:21.880]  in all of this protest is that
[3:02:21.880 --> 3:02:23.880]  it is the working class against the
[3:02:23.880 --> 3:02:25.880]  elites who have no idea how things work.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:27.880]  This lady thinks that everybody has a commercial
[3:02:27.880 --> 3:02:29.880]  driver's license and they can just steal
[3:02:29.880 --> 3:02:31.880]  a big rig.
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:33.880]  Is that what she thinks? Of course she does
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:35.880]  because she's from the avocado and toast class
[3:02:35.880 --> 3:02:37.880]  and she thinks she's much better than
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:39.880]  the cover all class of people
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:41.880]  currently setting the country free.
[3:02:41.880 --> 3:02:43.880]  We've also
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:45.880]  seen people who are normally not engaged
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:47.880]  in civil disobedience
[3:02:47.880 --> 3:02:49.880]  the leave me alone type of people
[3:02:49.880 --> 3:02:51.880]  they are joining this protest. For example
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:53.880]  in southern Alberta the province where I'm in
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:55.880]  there's been a border blockade
[3:02:55.880 --> 3:02:57.880]  between Alberta
[3:02:57.880 --> 3:02:59.880]  and Montana now ongoing a week
[3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:01.880]  and at first it started with the truckers
[3:03:01.880 --> 3:03:03.880]  protesting the vaccine mandate
[3:03:03.880 --> 3:03:05.880]  and then the farmers came
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:07.880]  and they brought all of their equipment
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:09.880]  and now there are hundreds of people down there
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:11.880]  at the border site but also
[3:03:11.880 --> 3:03:13.880]  next door sort of
[3:03:13.880 --> 3:03:15.880]  up the road because police are blocking
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:17.880]  people now from coming into
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:19.880]  the protest site
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:21.880]  initially they were even blocking people from bringing
[3:03:21.880 --> 3:03:23.880]  in again food, water,
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:25.880]  fuel and medicine
[3:03:25.880 --> 3:03:27.880]  but they're corralling supporters up the road
[3:03:27.880 --> 3:03:29.880]  in another town and that town is quickly
[3:03:29.880 --> 3:03:31.880]  becoming one of the largest towns
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:33.880]  in southern Alberta
[3:03:33.880 --> 3:03:35.880]  because there are
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:37.880]  thousands and thousands of people
[3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:39.880]  in town supporting the truckers
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:41.880]  they just can't get there to support them
[3:03:41.880 --> 3:03:43.880]  things are changing
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:45.880]  and the people who normally
[3:03:45.880 --> 3:03:47.880]  don't get engaged in this sort of stuff
[3:03:47.880 --> 3:03:49.880]  are willing to put everything on the line
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:51.880]  the government is saying
[3:03:51.880 --> 3:03:53.880]  we could come and seize your equipment for some of these
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:55.880]  farmers that's a million dollar piece of equipment
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:03:57.880]  the government could confiscate
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:03:59.880]  but freedom
[3:03:59.880 --> 3:04:01.880]  to them is so much more important
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:03.880]  Well absolutely there's not enough tow trucks in the whole city
[3:04:03.880 --> 3:04:05.880]  to get those out in a month
[3:04:05.880 --> 3:04:07.880]  which is what again as you said
[3:04:07.880 --> 3:04:09.880]  the avocado toast ruling class
[3:04:09.880 --> 3:04:11.880]  doesn't get. Sheila, Gun Reed
[3:04:11.880 --> 3:04:13.880]  thank you so much for spending time with us
[3:04:13.880 --> 3:04:15.880]  and please join me tomorrow
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:17.880]  my special Saturday show or the Sunday show
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:19.880]  and you and Ezra for updates
[3:04:19.880 --> 3:04:21.880]  as this unfolds but it sounds to me
[3:04:21.880 --> 3:04:23.880]  like the police want to side
[3:04:23.880 --> 3:04:25.880]  with the actual working class
[3:04:25.880 --> 3:04:27.880]  and not with the elite champagne
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:29.880]  avocado toast class
[3:04:29.880 --> 3:04:31.880]  You know we've had a lot of police
[3:04:31.880 --> 3:04:33.880]  and even some military today speak out against this
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:35.880]  people who are willing to walk off their jobs
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:37.880]  and say this is not what I signed up for
[3:04:37.880 --> 3:04:39.880]  I signed up to protect the civil liberties
[3:04:39.880 --> 3:04:41.880]  of Canadians and not become
[3:04:41.880 --> 3:04:43.880]  the enforcement arm of the biomedical police
[3:04:43.880 --> 3:04:45.880]  state in Ottawa
[3:04:45.880 --> 3:04:47.880]  Amazing, rebelnews.com
[3:04:47.880 --> 3:04:49.880]  Sheila, thank you so much
[3:04:49.880 --> 3:04:51.880]  and we really appreciate you
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:55.880]  Wow, okay we'll be back with your phone calls
[3:04:55.880 --> 3:04:57.880]  and then Jason Burmes
[3:04:57.880 --> 3:04:59.880]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C
[3:04:59.880 --> 3:05:01.880]  and zinc are great stepping stones
[3:05:01.880 --> 3:05:03.880]  to leading a healthier life
[3:05:03.880 --> 3:05:05.880]  InfoWars has made it easier
[3:05:05.880 --> 3:05:07.880]  to make sure you are getting enough in your system
[3:05:07.880 --> 3:05:09.880]  with a supplement that contains both
[3:05:09.880 --> 3:05:11.880]  This InfoWars life offering
[3:05:11.880 --> 3:05:13.880]  vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips
[3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:15.880]  should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store
[3:05:15.880 --> 3:05:17.880]  The rose hips contained within
[3:05:17.880 --> 3:05:19.880]  are a part of the rose flower
[3:05:19.880 --> 3:05:21.880]  just below the petals
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:23.880]  that contain the rose plant seeds
[3:05:23.880 --> 3:05:25.880]  Natural chemicals found in the hips
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:27.880]  may even be helpful for
[3:05:27.880 --> 3:05:29.880]  variety of health conditions
[3:05:29.880 --> 3:05:31.880]  including those with osteoarthritis
[3:05:31.880 --> 3:05:33.880]  and for those with pain after surgery
[3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:35.880]  studies have shown
[3:05:35.880 --> 3:05:37.880]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves
[3:05:37.880 --> 3:05:39.880]  you probably already know that they play an important role
[3:05:39.880 --> 3:05:41.880]  in nutrition, immune defense
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:43.880]  and the maintenance of your everyday health
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:45.880]  It has been reported that intake of
[3:05:45.880 --> 3:05:47.880]  both is often inadequate
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:49.880]  even in affluent populations
[3:05:49.880 --> 3:05:51.880]  like here in America
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:53.880]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out
[3:05:53.880 --> 3:05:55.880]  at InfoWarsStore.com
[3:05:55.880 --> 3:05:59.880]  Don't Lie
[3:06:09.880 --> 3:06:11.880]  I want to be
[3:06:11.880 --> 3:06:13.880]  infinity clear
[3:06:13.880 --> 3:06:15.880]  with all of you
[3:06:15.880 --> 3:06:17.880]  I could put a trillion different
[3:06:17.880 --> 3:06:19.880]  data points into this
[3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:21.880]  and we can talk all day about those points
[3:06:21.880 --> 3:06:23.880]  but just know this, we're winning
[3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:25.880]  Things aren't going well for the globalist
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:27.880]  They had some contingency plans
[3:06:27.880 --> 3:06:29.880]  and they kind of had it
[3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:31.880]  baked into the cake that we'd resist
[3:06:31.880 --> 3:06:33.880]  but they are crapping their bitches right now
[3:06:33.880 --> 3:06:35.880]  Now
[3:06:35.880 --> 3:06:37.880]  don't get all confident on me yet
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:39.880]  because you know
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:41.880]  they got a bunch of tricks up their sleeves
[3:06:41.880 --> 3:06:43.880]  But as long as we know
[3:06:43.880 --> 3:06:45.880]  what their tricks are
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:47.880]  Shiber, blackouts, wars
[3:06:47.880 --> 3:06:49.880]  new viruses
[3:06:49.880 --> 3:06:51.880]  currency collapses
[3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:53.880]  race wars
[3:06:53.880 --> 3:06:55.880]  as long as we know
[3:06:55.880 --> 3:06:57.880]  what dirty tricks they got
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:06:59.880]  up their sleeve
[3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:01.880]  as long as we have solidarity
[3:07:01.880 --> 3:07:03.880]  as people together
[3:07:03.880 --> 3:07:05.880]  for our basic human rights
[3:07:05.880 --> 3:07:07.880]  they can piss up a rope
[3:07:07.880 --> 3:07:09.880]  and I knew this
[3:07:09.880 --> 3:07:11.880]  instinctively
[3:07:11.880 --> 3:07:13.880]  and it wasn't me, it was God working through me
[3:07:13.880 --> 3:07:15.880]  30 years ago when I was battling to get on air
[3:07:15.880 --> 3:07:17.880]  and just had this instinct and it wasn't to be
[3:07:17.880 --> 3:07:19.880]  a movie star, it wasn't to be cool
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:21.880]  I just knew this was all going down
[3:07:21.880 --> 3:07:23.880]  and I could see it and I just had a feeling
[3:07:23.880 --> 3:07:25.880]  and I
[3:07:25.880 --> 3:07:27.880]  intellectually knew a lot about the New World Order
[3:07:27.880 --> 3:07:29.880]  and things but I had no idea
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:31.880]  just how epic it would get
[3:07:33.880 --> 3:07:35.880]  and here we are and now I can look back
[3:07:35.880 --> 3:07:37.880]  and I can see God did every
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:39.880]  bit of this
[3:07:39.880 --> 3:07:41.880]  on the side of good and the devil
[3:07:41.880 --> 3:07:43.880]  did every bit of it on the other side
[3:07:45.880 --> 3:07:47.880]  and
[3:07:47.880 --> 3:07:49.880]  God and the devil are just as real as night and day
[3:07:49.880 --> 3:07:51.880]  ladies and gentlemen
[3:07:51.880 --> 3:07:53.880]  but there's not just the archetype
[3:07:53.880 --> 3:07:55.880]  of the devil, the archetype of God
[3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:57.880]  there's really the God
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:07:59.880]  the supreme being that made all this
[3:07:59.880 --> 3:08:01.880]  obviously
[3:08:01.880 --> 3:08:03.880]  and the bad guy
[3:08:03.880 --> 3:08:05.880]  and
[3:08:05.880 --> 3:08:07.880]  there's a chief bad guy
[3:08:07.880 --> 3:08:09.880]  and he's got a lot of other things
[3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:11.880]  that
[3:08:11.880 --> 3:08:13.880]  Motley Crue that goes along with
[3:08:13.880 --> 3:08:15.880]  his plan
[3:08:15.880 --> 3:08:17.880]  and his plan is not God's plan
[3:08:17.880 --> 3:08:19.880]  in fact if you know God's plan
[3:08:19.880 --> 3:08:21.880]  free will
[3:08:21.880 --> 3:08:23.880]  and empowerment and beauty and health
[3:08:23.880 --> 3:08:25.880]  and regeneration and honor
[3:08:25.880 --> 3:08:27.880]  and just goodness
[3:08:27.880 --> 3:08:29.880]  and discovery and
[3:08:29.880 --> 3:08:31.880]  creation
[3:08:31.880 --> 3:08:33.880]  just so good
[3:08:33.880 --> 3:08:35.880]  everything is good
[3:08:35.880 --> 3:08:37.880]  total satisfaction
[3:08:37.880 --> 3:08:39.880]  just unbelievable
[3:08:39.880 --> 3:08:41.880]  being the presence of God
[3:08:41.880 --> 3:08:43.880]  I've only had a few times
[3:08:43.880 --> 3:08:45.880]  to be able to actually be in God's presence
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:47.880]  it's unbelievable
[3:08:47.880 --> 3:08:49.880]  unbelievably satisfying
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:51.880]  because the Holy Spirit is just kind of
[3:08:51.880 --> 3:08:53.880]  catching a little ray like God's aura
[3:08:53.880 --> 3:08:55.880]  but to be in God's real presence
[3:08:55.880 --> 3:08:57.880]  is like you just want to get
[3:08:57.880 --> 3:08:59.880]  on the ground and lay down
[3:08:59.880 --> 3:09:01.880]  because it's so intense you can't even handle it
[3:09:01.880 --> 3:09:03.880]  and it's like oh I'm totally complete
[3:09:03.880 --> 3:09:05.880]  everything and oh oh
[3:09:05.880 --> 3:09:07.880]  it's you know
[3:09:07.880 --> 3:09:09.880]  and I'm trying to describe that feeling of completion
[3:09:09.880 --> 3:09:11.880]  because it's not like you're in ecstasy
[3:09:11.880 --> 3:09:13.880]  for one last you're like
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:15.880]  oh this goes on forever
[3:09:15.880 --> 3:09:17.880]  this is eternity this is timelessness
[3:09:17.880 --> 3:09:19.880]  oh I can know everything now
[3:09:19.880 --> 3:09:21.880]  anything you want to know you can know it
[3:09:21.880 --> 3:09:23.880]  but you don't even want to know it
[3:09:23.880 --> 3:09:25.880]  you just want to go oh God I love you
[3:09:25.880 --> 3:09:27.880]  and there's just that
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:29.880]  that total completion
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:31.880]  can you imagine the people that
[3:09:31.880 --> 3:09:33.880]  had the opportunity to be with that
[3:09:33.880 --> 3:09:35.880]  and decided to break with it
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:37.880]  Satan saw that as slavery
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:39.880]  Satan could build whatever he wanted
[3:09:39.880 --> 3:09:41.880]  do whatever he wanted
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:43.880]  know whatever he wanted
[3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:45.880]  but he wasn't God
[3:09:47.880 --> 3:09:49.880]  can't be God
[3:09:49.880 --> 3:09:51.880]  isn't God
[3:09:51.880 --> 3:09:53.880]  and so Satan said
[3:09:53.880 --> 3:09:55.880]  I'm going to burn this down
[3:09:55.880 --> 3:09:57.880]  God said go ahead and try
[3:09:59.880 --> 3:10:01.880]  oh by the way
[3:10:01.880 --> 3:10:03.880]  I'm creating all these new entities
[3:10:03.880 --> 3:10:05.880]  that have free will just like I did
[3:10:05.880 --> 3:10:07.880]  little tiny versions of myself
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:09.880]  go ahead and have Adam
[3:10:09.880 --> 3:10:11.880]  let's see
[3:10:11.880 --> 3:10:13.880]  if you can even beat
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:17.880]  my babies
[3:10:19.880 --> 3:10:21.880]  and then there comes
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:23.880]  the argument is God the greatest satis
[3:10:23.880 --> 3:10:25.880]  that ever existed and no
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:27.880]  God is lonely
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:29.880]  God wanted communion with us
[3:10:29.880 --> 3:10:31.880]  and so God did this thing
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:33.880]  and I agree with God
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:35.880]  I'm thankful for God for the choice
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:37.880]  of consciousness and I understand all the pain that comes with it
[3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:39.880]  but I appreciate it
[3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:41.880]  and I totally understand it
[3:10:41.880 --> 3:10:43.880]  but God is perfect
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:45.880]  and in the perfect thought decided to do this
[3:10:45.880 --> 3:10:47.880]  but Satanists will always argue
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:49.880]  why is your God allowed death
[3:10:49.880 --> 3:10:51.880]  why is your God allowed pain
[3:10:51.880 --> 3:10:53.880]  why is your God allowed all this
[3:10:53.880 --> 3:10:55.880]  why is your God because we got free will
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:10:57.880]  that's why
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:10:59.880]  and you can't be given the keys to the universe
[3:10:59.880 --> 3:11:01.880]  until you've been tested
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:03.880]  and you're on earth
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:05.880]  you're not going to be given all that
[3:11:05.880 --> 3:11:07.880]  power
[3:11:07.880 --> 3:11:09.880]  until you've proven
[3:11:09.880 --> 3:11:11.880]  that you're willing to get
[3:11:11.880 --> 3:11:13.880]  hurt for doing the right thing
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:15.880]  nothing good is given for free
[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.880]  alright let's go to the phone calls
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:21.880]  and I apologize for making you hold
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:23.880]  it's been home the longest I've been preaching here today
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:25.880]  Clayton in Canada we love you
[3:11:25.880 --> 3:11:27.880]  you're a trucker, concerns over the protest
[3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:29.880]  tell us sir please
[3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:31.880]  I'm alright brother
[3:11:31.880 --> 3:11:33.880]  so
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:35.880]  my concern is right now
[3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:37.880]  in order to get off my job
[3:11:37.880 --> 3:11:39.880]  in a way I might actually be
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:41.880]  stopped by
[3:11:41.880 --> 3:11:43.880]  like the blockades looking
[3:11:43.880 --> 3:11:45.880]  for people trying to blockade if you know what I mean
[3:11:45.880 --> 3:11:47.880]  you're saying there's checkpoints
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:49.880]  looking for people trying to blockade
[3:11:49.880 --> 3:11:51.880]  yeah
[3:11:51.880 --> 3:11:53.880]  so that's a concern but
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:55.880]  describe what these checkpoints are like for us
[3:11:55.880 --> 3:11:57.880]  unfortunately I haven't hit it yet
[3:11:57.880 --> 3:11:59.880]  I've just heard about people saying
[3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:01.880]  you know you might have issues getting where you need to go
[3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:03.880]  because it's kind of on multiple sides
[3:12:03.880 --> 3:12:05.880]  but
[3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:07.880]  I do have a 240 character speech
[3:12:07.880 --> 3:12:09.880]  that might satisfy the Hollywood
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:11.880]  warrior speeches you guys were talking about
[3:12:11.880 --> 3:12:13.880]  yeah go ahead read it to us
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:15.880]  I'll get there
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:17.880]  first X2, X3
[3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:19.880]  superman vitality, mineral
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:21.880]  fusion
[3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:23.880]  ultra b12 plus, brain force
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:25.880]  bone broth
[3:12:25.880 --> 3:12:27.880]  even some of the older stuff like the micro zx
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:29.880]  and oxy powder I don't really hear you guys talking about
[3:12:29.880 --> 3:12:31.880]  anymore
[3:12:31.880 --> 3:12:33.880]  all the really great products
[3:12:33.880 --> 3:12:35.880]  I can't seem to order your food in Canada though
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:37.880]  I'm not sure what's going on there
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:39.880]  I'm not sure what's going on there
[3:12:39.880 --> 3:12:41.880]  but anyway
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.880]  sounds like they might have the stingray systems in Ottawa right now
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:45.880]  I don't know if you've heard anything about that
[3:12:45.880 --> 3:12:47.880]  yeah the stingray scoop up and steal all the cell phone data
[3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:49.880]  yeah so there's that
[3:12:49.880 --> 3:12:51.880]  but yeah let this
[3:12:51.880 --> 3:12:53.880]  let this movement flood their intel hubs
[3:12:53.880 --> 3:12:55.880]  speech I guess 240 character speech
[3:12:55.880 --> 3:12:57.880]  anyway in moments when the collective
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:12:59.880]  conscious takes a moment to reflect
[3:12:59.880 --> 3:13:01.880]  what the next steps will be
[3:13:01.880 --> 3:13:03.880]  in this moment I ask citizens
[3:13:03.880 --> 3:13:05.880]  of Earth to take up a singular cause
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:07.880]  we all know we've been abused
[3:13:07.880 --> 3:13:09.880]  with one voice I ask you to say no
[3:13:09.880 --> 3:13:11.880]  never again
[3:13:11.880 --> 3:13:13.880]  let the great reckoning commence
[3:13:15.880 --> 3:13:17.880]  absolutely
[3:13:17.880 --> 3:13:19.880]  this is the great reckoning brother and
[3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:21.880]  we really appreciate all the truckers standing up
[3:13:21.880 --> 3:13:23.880]  who would have thought it would be Canada
[3:13:23.880 --> 3:13:25.880]  that everybody had written off
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:27.880]  that would end up being the genesis point of the resistance
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:29.880]  have you ever been in a fight
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:31.880]  in an hockey game with a Canadian
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:33.880]  exactly
[3:13:33.880 --> 3:13:35.880]  no I know and
[3:13:35.880 --> 3:13:37.880]  I love that meme
[3:13:37.880 --> 3:13:39.880]  imagine when the people that just want to be left alone
[3:13:39.880 --> 3:13:41.880]  get involved
[3:13:41.880 --> 3:13:43.880]  thank you so much and God bless you Clayton
[3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:45.880]  David in Detroit
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:47.880]  go ahead sir welcome
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:49.880]  hey Alex
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:51.880]  I just wanted to say thank you for everything
[3:13:51.880 --> 3:13:53.880]  you and your crew do you guys are amazing
[3:13:53.880 --> 3:13:55.880]  I'm a local
[3:13:55.880 --> 3:13:57.880]  truck driver over here in Detroit
[3:13:57.880 --> 3:13:59.880]  and it's been really fascinating
[3:13:59.880 --> 3:14:01.880]  what's going on in Canada right now
[3:14:01.880 --> 3:14:03.880]  and the bridge is in fact
[3:14:03.880 --> 3:14:05.880]  completely shut down just drove by
[3:14:05.880 --> 3:14:07.880]  a couple hours ago
[3:14:07.880 --> 3:14:09.880]  on the US side they got
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:11.880]  barricades and police everywhere
[3:14:11.880 --> 3:14:13.880]  you're not even getting close to that bridge
[3:14:15.880 --> 3:14:17.880]  well as a trucker as an American
[3:14:17.880 --> 3:14:19.880]  what's your view
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:21.880]  you know I think it's so important
[3:14:21.880 --> 3:14:23.880]  for humans to have the freedom of choice
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:25.880]  and I think it's absolutely atrocious
[3:14:25.880 --> 3:14:27.880]  what these governments and globalists
[3:14:27.880 --> 3:14:29.880]  are trying to do to us as a population
[3:14:29.880 --> 3:14:31.880]  to try and control us
[3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:33.880]  and you know I'm a young guy
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:35.880]  and it's been really
[3:14:35.880 --> 3:14:37.880]  interesting growing up
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:39.880]  with all this technology and stuff
[3:14:39.880 --> 3:14:41.880]  and they keep trying to convince us
[3:14:41.880 --> 3:14:43.880]  to just you know get plugged in
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:45.880]  get plugged in with the program
[3:14:45.880 --> 3:14:47.880]  you know I gotta say
[3:14:47.880 --> 3:14:49.880]  becoming a truck driver has been the most
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:51.880]  freeing experience for me in my entire life
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:53.880]  and you know
[3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:55.880]  driving through the country
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:57.880]  and seeing this incredible creation
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:14:59.880]  that God has given us the opportunity
[3:14:59.880 --> 3:15:01.880]  to wake up to everyday is just mind-boggling
[3:15:01.880 --> 3:15:03.880]  and I really hope and pray
[3:15:03.880 --> 3:15:05.880]  for all the Canadians out there
[3:15:05.880 --> 3:15:07.880]  that they just peacefully keep up the good fight
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:09.880]  and don't give up
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:11.880]  that's a beautiful thing
[3:15:11.880 --> 3:15:13.880]  you just said David you're right this is a very
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:15.880]  very important moment in history
[3:15:15.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  and it all is
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:19.880]  about good versus evil
[3:15:19.880 --> 3:15:21.880]  and it's
[3:15:21.880 --> 3:15:23.880]  just amazing that these globalists think they own us
[3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:25.880]  they think we're supposed to just roll over
[3:15:25.880 --> 3:15:27.880]  into our graves and let them inherit
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:29.880]  the future but I'm telling Klaus Schwab and the rest of them
[3:15:29.880 --> 3:15:31.880]  that's not going to happen my friend
[3:15:31.880 --> 3:15:33.880]  no heck no
[3:15:33.880 --> 3:15:35.880]  and it is we the people who must stand together
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:37.880]  to fight this tyranny
[3:15:37.880 --> 3:15:39.880]  we the people united
[3:15:39.880 --> 3:15:41.880]  can never be defeated
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:43.880]  David thank you so much
[3:15:43.880 --> 3:15:45.880]  I'm going to hand a baton to Jason Burma
[3:15:45.880 --> 3:15:47.880]  but I promise every caller is going to come back

[3:16:59.880 --> 3:17:01.880]  plotting their next big lockdown
[3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:03.880]  for the next phase of the great reset
[3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  being a stage cyber attack
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:07.880]  with the deep state pushing a civil war
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:09.880]  not just here
[3:17:09.880 --> 3:17:11.880]  but in Europe and war with Russia
[3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:13.880]  with the massive inflation
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:15.880]  and all the other garbage that's taking place

[3:17:41.880 --> 3:17:43.880]  cutting this to get 25%
[3:17:43.880 --> 3:17:45.880]  off at preparewithalix.com

[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:53.880]  this is absolutely essential for everybody
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:55.880]  that wants to be self sufficient
[3:17:55.880 --> 3:17:57.880]  a riotous mob
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:17:59.880]  whether they were present that day
[3:17:59.880 --> 3:18:01.880]  or were otherwise criminally responsible
[3:18:01.880 --> 3:18:03.880]  for the assault on our democracy
[3:18:03.880 --> 3:18:05.880]  we will follow the facts
[3:18:05.880 --> 3:18:07.880]  wherever they lead
[3:18:07.880 --> 3:18:09.880]  domestic terrorists
[3:18:09.880 --> 3:18:11.880]  the days of
[3:18:11.880 --> 3:18:13.880]  independent media are numbered
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  the government has made it illegal to oppose them
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:17.880]  they are now deep banking us
[3:18:17.880 --> 3:18:19.880]  behind the scenes
[3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:21.880]  they want to bankrupt us and make us go away
[3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:23.880]  quietly with practically
[3:18:23.880 --> 3:18:25.880]  half the population wanting to
[3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:27.880]  lock the unvaccinated up in camps
[3:18:27.880 --> 3:18:29.880]  the traders know they can
[3:18:29.880 --> 3:18:31.880]  take us down by force
[3:18:31.880 --> 3:18:33.880]  but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:35.880]  so be it
[3:18:35.880 --> 3:18:37.880]  make them silence us by force
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:39.880]  this is the final battle
[3:18:39.880 --> 3:18:41.880]  of the information war
[3:18:41.880 --> 3:18:43.880]  give now, buy products
[3:18:43.880 --> 3:18:45.880]  donate
[3:18:45.880 --> 3:18:47.880]  before everything changes
[3:18:47.880 --> 3:18:49.880]  we need you to carry us through to the end
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:51.880]  victory or death
[3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:53.880]  go now to infowarstore.com
[3:18:55.880 --> 3:18:57.880]  let's go ahead and take another call
[3:18:57.880 --> 3:18:59.880]  to Malcolm in Tennessee
[3:18:59.880 --> 3:19:01.880]  hello Alex, yes Malcolm
[3:19:01.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  I will make this quick and real short
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:05.880]  where the other patrons can get on the line
[3:19:05.880 --> 3:19:07.880]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[3:19:07.880 --> 3:19:09.880]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer
[3:19:09.880 --> 3:19:11.880]  SuperMell Vitality
[3:19:11.880 --> 3:19:13.880]  and Brainforce Plus
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:15.880]  mix those two together, you're an unstoppable tank
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:17.880]  SuperMell Vitality really really works
[3:19:17.880 --> 3:19:19.880]  it's cold pressed herbs
[3:19:19.880 --> 3:19:21.880]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up
[3:19:21.880 --> 3:19:23.880]  and so it has
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:25.880]  a dramatic effect compared to
[3:19:25.880 --> 3:19:27.880]  powdered versions that also work quite well
[3:19:27.880 --> 3:19:29.880]  but just aren't as strong
[3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:31.880]  this is like a very fine wine
[3:19:31.880 --> 3:19:33.880]  in fact each batch is different
[3:19:33.880 --> 3:19:35.880]  sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay
[3:19:35.880 --> 3:19:37.880]  people are like why are you selling something and admitting
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:39.880]  sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[3:19:39.880 --> 3:19:41.880]  that's just how it is, it's how it works
[3:19:41.880 --> 3:19:43.880]  so it's always good
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:45.880]  sometimes it's like super strong
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:47.880]  but yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:55.880]  then this is it
[3:20:17.880 --> 3:20:19.880]  alright ladies and gentlemen again
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:21.880]  thank you so much for joining us
[3:20:21.880 --> 3:20:23.880]  we'll do a special show tomorrow
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:25.880]  it's going to be taped here
[3:20:25.880 --> 3:20:27.880]  but it's going to be several big guests
[3:20:27.880 --> 3:20:29.880]  you're not going to want to miss it
[3:20:29.880 --> 3:20:31.880]  on the Saturday
[3:20:31.880 --> 3:20:33.880]  special transmission
[3:20:33.880 --> 3:20:35.880]  I got one more caller the Pope I want to hit
[3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:37.880]  and then Jason Bermas I appreciate co-hosting
[3:20:37.880 --> 3:20:39.880]  he's about to take over, he always has a lot of amazing
[3:20:39.880 --> 3:20:41.880]  things to go over
[3:20:41.880 --> 3:20:43.880]  and it's just this
[3:20:43.880 --> 3:20:45.880]  our hopes and dreams are all embodied by
[3:20:45.880 --> 3:20:47.880]  these truckers
[3:20:47.880 --> 3:20:49.880]  not just in Canada but all over the world
[3:20:49.880 --> 3:20:51.880]  that are standing up
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:53.880]  and doing the right thing and going against the system
[3:20:53.880 --> 3:20:55.880]  because they give
[3:20:55.880 --> 3:20:57.880]  courage to other people that feel all alone
[3:20:57.880 --> 3:20:59.880]  and don't know
[3:20:59.880 --> 3:21:01.880]  that other people feel the way they do
[3:21:01.880 --> 3:21:03.880]  and that's why you see this program
[3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:05.880]  worldwide falling apart and faltering
[3:21:05.880 --> 3:21:07.880]  from as far away as Singapore
[3:21:07.880 --> 3:21:09.880]  to
[3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:11.880]  Israel
[3:21:11.880 --> 3:21:13.880]  to blue cities all over the US
[3:21:13.880 --> 3:21:15.880]  all over the United States
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:17.880]  all saying no more masks on children
[3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:19.880]  no more forced inoculations
[3:21:19.880 --> 3:21:21.880]  no more vaccine passports
[3:21:21.880 --> 3:21:23.880]  because they know it's
[3:21:23.880 --> 3:21:25.880]  backfired on them
[3:21:25.880 --> 3:21:27.880]  they're going to back off and then bring it back again
[3:21:27.880 --> 3:21:29.880]  but for now
[3:21:29.880 --> 3:21:31.880]  things are not going the way they wanted them to
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:33.880]  so this is a very epic moment
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:35.880]  and we've got to though reconstitute who we are
[3:21:35.880 --> 3:21:37.880]  we've got to rebuild our infrastructures
[3:21:37.880 --> 3:21:39.880]  we've got to know that we're waking up to the fight we're in
[3:21:39.880 --> 3:21:41.880]  but this was just one battle
[3:21:41.880 --> 3:21:43.880]  that we're barely winning
[3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:45.880]  the war is going to get much more serious
[3:21:45.880 --> 3:21:47.880]  it's like a video game the next levels get
[3:21:47.880 --> 3:21:49.880]  more intense we get stronger too
[3:21:49.880 --> 3:21:51.880]  and the more we wake up the more we don't care anymore
[3:21:51.880 --> 3:21:53.880]  and the more we don't have any fear
[3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:55.880]  we care about our children
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:21:57.880]  and our future but we don't care about what the globalists
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:21:59.880]  say about us or do to us
[3:21:59.880 --> 3:22:01.880]  the stronger we get
[3:22:01.880 --> 3:22:03.880]  God doesn't give you anything you can't handle
[3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:05.880]  now I'm going to tell you though you're going to be incrementally challenged now
[3:22:05.880 --> 3:22:07.880]  and if you step up
[3:22:07.880 --> 3:22:09.880]  you're going to be one of the people that helps take down
[3:22:09.880 --> 3:22:11.880]  the new world order this broadcast is the tip of the spear
[3:22:11.880 --> 3:22:13.880]  so I need your support
[3:22:13.880 --> 3:22:15.880]  plus I got great products you need
[3:22:15.880 --> 3:22:17.880]  sales going to end Monday night at like midnight

[3:22:37.880 --> 3:22:39.880]  you can guess that Biden's a clown of course
[3:22:39.880 --> 3:22:41.880]  we have to come and make me
[3:22:41.880 --> 3:22:43.880]  a shirt as well

[3:22:49.880 --> 3:22:51.880]  two minutes but right now one of
[3:22:51.880 --> 3:22:53.880]  there's the emoji shirt it's really awesome

[3:23:01.880 --> 3:23:03.880]  and then you see the clown president

[3:23:05.880 --> 3:23:07.880]  Andrew Jackson George Washington they're all there
[3:23:07.880 --> 3:23:09.880]  I already saw a design
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:11.880]  kind of like this I think made a better design
[3:23:11.880 --> 3:23:13.880]  I kind of improvised it and updated it
[3:23:13.880 --> 3:23:15.880]  but the Pope
[3:23:15.880 --> 3:23:17.880]  the Pope in Canada welcome and I
[3:23:17.880 --> 3:23:19.880]  appreciate you holding
[3:23:21.880 --> 3:23:23.880]  going to talk to you
[3:23:23.880 --> 3:23:25.880]  yes sir go ahead
[3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:27.880]  oh hi Alex I just want to say
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:29.880]  happy birthday first and foremost
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:31.880]  and the other thing I wanted to ask you
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:33.880]  is so how much you think
[3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:35.880]  this trucker convoy became a distraction
[3:23:35.880 --> 3:23:37.880]  because I'm starting to think
[3:23:37.880 --> 3:23:39.880]  they wanted this to be like a
[3:23:39.880 --> 3:23:41.880]  a weekend protest and it got out
[3:23:41.880 --> 3:23:43.880]  of hand they lost control I'm
[3:23:43.880 --> 3:23:45.880]  thinking they might just try to use them
[3:23:45.880 --> 3:23:47.880]  as pasties give them a little bit of a win
[3:23:47.880 --> 3:23:49.880]  only to clamp down tighter
[3:23:49.880 --> 3:23:51.880]  I was wondering what your thoughts are on that
[3:23:51.880 --> 3:23:53.880]  well certainly you can
[3:23:55.880 --> 3:23:57.880]  war game it out and see they could
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:23:59.880]  provocateur they could do a bombing and blaming on them
[3:23:59.880 --> 3:24:01.880]  but I think the truckers are real I know they are
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:03.880]  I know the globalist aren't all powerful
[3:24:03.880 --> 3:24:05.880]  when we exercise our will
[3:24:05.880 --> 3:24:07.880]  and I see the globalist looking very very upset
[3:24:07.880 --> 3:24:09.880]  and so I think from
[3:24:09.880 --> 3:24:11.880]  Australia to the US to
[3:24:11.880 --> 3:24:13.880]  Canada to Europe
[3:24:13.880 --> 3:24:15.880]  the Belgian farmers with their
[3:24:15.880 --> 3:24:17.880]  tractors pushing the
[3:24:17.880 --> 3:24:19.880]  armored vehicles out of the way that's real
[3:24:19.880 --> 3:24:21.880]  and when push comes to shove
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:23.880]  the military and police
[3:24:23.880 --> 3:24:25.880]  are deciding to join with the people so
[3:24:25.880 --> 3:24:27.880]  Viva Vendetta is a fiction movie
[3:24:27.880 --> 3:24:29.880]  but it's based on the Romanian
[3:24:29.880 --> 3:24:31.880]  Chescue event and a composite of others where
[3:24:31.880 --> 3:24:33.880]  the military already killed a bunch of citizens
[3:24:33.880 --> 3:24:35.880]  millions showed up at the palace
[3:24:35.880 --> 3:24:37.880]  and when they
[3:24:37.880 --> 3:24:39.880]  marched from the palace the military didn't
[3:24:39.880 --> 3:24:41.880]  shoot them and then an hour
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:43.880]  couple hours later Chescue and his wife
[3:24:43.880 --> 3:24:45.880]  were facing a firing squad
[3:24:45.880 --> 3:24:47.880]  and so that's really where Viva Vendetta
[3:24:47.880 --> 3:24:49.880]  listen I don't want Trudeau to face this firing squad
[3:24:49.880 --> 3:24:51.880]  I don't want Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates
[3:24:51.880 --> 3:24:53.880]  I want him in prison
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:24:55.880]  and I want it all to come out in court
[3:24:55.880 --> 3:24:57.880]  I want Nuremberg 2.0
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:24:59.880]  yeah they did this
[3:24:59.880 --> 3:25:01.880]  attack with the virus and the lockdowns
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:03.880]  because their whole program was in trouble
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:05.880]  they didn't do it out of strength and out of weakness
[3:25:05.880 --> 3:25:07.880]  I appreciate your call Pope
[3:25:07.880 --> 3:25:09.880]  alright
[3:25:09.880 --> 3:25:11.880]  tomorrow I'm not sure with the crew I'm coming up here
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:13.880]  at like 11am we got three big guests
[3:25:13.880 --> 3:25:15.880]  tomorrow one of them is really amazing
[3:25:15.880 --> 3:25:17.880]  they're all amazing one is really cool
[3:25:17.880 --> 3:25:19.880]  whenever we're done taping it it'll be
[3:25:19.880 --> 3:25:21.880]  posted to Bandai Video
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:23.880]  people love the Saturday shows that's coming up tomorrow
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:25.880]  I would guess
[3:25:25.880 --> 3:25:27.880]  probably be out about five or six o'clock tomorrow
[3:25:27.880 --> 3:25:29.880]  because it's so big there's so many guests
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:31.880]  and so much stuff Jason Bermas thanks
[3:25:31.880 --> 3:25:33.880]  for being here sorry I stole some of your time
[3:25:33.880 --> 3:25:35.880]  we love you Jason please take over
[3:25:35.880 --> 3:25:37.880]  thank you sir
[3:25:37.880 --> 3:25:39.880]  and hopefully this broadcast is going to be
[3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:41.880]  a compliment to the previous
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:43.880]  three plus
[3:25:43.880 --> 3:25:45.880]  hours we're going to be talking about
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:47.880]  other people standing up and
[3:25:47.880 --> 3:25:49.880]  what I think people really need to understand about this
[3:25:49.880 --> 3:25:51.880]  Canadian model is
[3:25:51.880 --> 3:25:53.880]  roughly 38 million
[3:25:53.880 --> 3:25:55.880]  people live
[3:25:55.880 --> 3:25:57.880]  in Canada just 38 million
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:25:59.880]  in New York alone
[3:25:59.880 --> 3:26:01.880]  where you have a comparative slave
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:03.880]  state minus the gulags
[3:26:03.880 --> 3:26:05.880]  they would love to have
[3:26:05.880 --> 3:26:07.880]  in place with their shielding methods
[3:26:07.880 --> 3:26:09.880]  legislation in place to do so
[3:26:09.880 --> 3:26:11.880]  and remember still torturing children
[3:26:11.880 --> 3:26:13.880]  still
[3:26:13.880 --> 3:26:15.880]  mandating masks on kids and in
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:17.880]  city buildings you have people
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:19.880]  standing up and taking over bridges
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:21.880]  you wouldn't know that
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:23.880]  by the mainstream media and again
[3:26:23.880 --> 3:26:25.880]  New York has 20 million people
[3:26:25.880 --> 3:26:27.880]  in that state around 10 million
[3:26:27.880 --> 3:26:29.880]  in New York City
[3:26:29.880 --> 3:26:31.880]  and Long Island so I want to play this
[3:26:31.880 --> 3:26:33.880]  clip another quick triumph
[3:26:33.880 --> 3:26:35.880]  of people standing up
[3:26:35.880 --> 3:26:37.880]  against these
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:39.880]  authoritarian measures
[3:26:39.880 --> 3:26:41.880]  here it is right here you won't see it in the national media
[3:26:41.880 --> 3:26:43.880]  and if you did
[3:26:43.880 --> 3:26:45.880]  they'd probably classify it as a
[3:26:45.880 --> 3:26:47.880]  white supremacist protest
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:49.880]  through the rain unfurling
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:51.880]  the American flag to claim their right
[3:26:55.880 --> 3:26:57.880]  bringing traffic to a standstill
[3:26:57.880 --> 3:26:59.880]  on the Brooklyn bridge
[3:27:01.880 --> 3:27:03.880]  I mean look at that woman right there
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:05.880]  who's clearly a white supremacist
[3:27:05.880 --> 3:27:07.880]  speaking out
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:09.880]  against the digital
[3:27:09.880 --> 3:27:11.880]  key to slavery pass
[3:27:11.880 --> 3:27:13.880]  wow she's terrible
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:15.880]  let's cancel her
[3:27:15.880 --> 3:27:17.880]  a few hundred
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:19.880]  people marching from Brooklyn to City Hall
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:21.880]  protesting the city's vaccine mandate
[3:27:21.880 --> 3:27:23.880]  terminating those who have not complied
[3:27:23.880 --> 3:27:25.880]  with getting the shot by February 11
[3:27:25.880 --> 3:27:27.880]  the city's saying this is a small percentage
[3:27:27.880 --> 3:27:29.880]  of city workers Mayor Adams told
[3:27:29.880 --> 3:27:31.880]  us in a statement more than 90%
[3:27:31.880 --> 3:27:33.880]  of employees are fully vaccinated
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:35.880]  and that number is increasing every day
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:37.880]  and remember fully vaccinated
[3:27:37.880 --> 3:27:39.880]  has moved to up to
[3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:41.880]  day alright and their
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:43.880]  90% number even if it's
[3:27:43.880 --> 3:27:45.880]  correct even if you gave them the benefit of the doubt
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:47.880]  doesn't mean
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:49.880]  they want a slavery pass
[3:27:49.880 --> 3:27:51.880]  every time they want to go to McDonald's
[3:27:51.880 --> 3:27:53.880]  or they want to exclude
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:55.880]  their loved ones
[3:27:55.880 --> 3:27:57.880]  who decided against
[3:27:57.880 --> 3:27:59.880]  taking DARPA
[3:27:59.880 --> 3:28:01.880]  bioweapon injections
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:03.880]  wow

[3:28:31.880 --> 3:28:33.880]  and save a life
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:35.880]  thousands of city workers who have not shown
[3:28:35.880 --> 3:28:37.880]  proof of their COVID vaccination
[3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:39.880]  or on leave without pay
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:41.880]  were sent separation notices last week
[3:28:41.880 --> 3:28:43.880]  and they're trying to induce these authoritarian
[3:28:43.880 --> 3:28:45.880]  measures they already lost
[3:28:45.880 --> 3:28:47.880]  in the state supreme court weeks ago
[3:28:47.880 --> 3:28:49.880]  on the mask mandates

[3:31:00.880 --> 3:31:02.880]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico
[3:31:02.880 --> 3:31:03.880]  the communists
[3:31:03.880 --> 3:31:05.880]  well that's where some of the best coffee
[3:31:05.880 --> 3:31:07.880]  in the world that's wild harvested
[3:31:07.880 --> 3:31:09.880]  above organic
[3:31:09.880 --> 3:31:10.880]  in the volcanic soil
[3:31:10.880 --> 3:31:11.880]  better than Guatemalan coffee
[3:31:11.880 --> 3:31:13.880]  and yeah we buy it from the little farmers
[3:31:13.880 --> 3:31:15.880]  that you know the media calls communists
[3:31:15.880 --> 3:31:16.880]  but really they're just a commune
[3:31:16.880 --> 3:31:17.880]  and whatever the point is
[3:31:17.880 --> 3:31:18.880]  is that it's good coffee
[3:31:18.880 --> 3:31:19.880]  and we've got it
[3:31:19.880 --> 3:31:21.880]  and the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over
[3:31:21.880 --> 3:31:23.880]  so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[3:31:23.880 --> 3:31:25.880]  and I've been buying it for what 14 years
[3:31:25.880 --> 3:31:26.880]  and the price has never gone up
[3:31:26.880 --> 3:31:27.880]  the same stuff sold at Whole Foods
[3:31:27.880 --> 3:31:28.880]  under another name
[3:31:28.880 --> 3:31:29.880]  for about 50% more
[3:31:29.880 --> 3:31:30.880]  per pound
[3:31:30.880 --> 3:31:31.880]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:31:31.880 --> 3:31:32.880]  you're gonna find anywhere
[3:31:32.880 --> 3:31:33.880]  it's Wake Up America
[3:31:33.880 --> 3:31:34.880]  Patriot Blend
[3:31:34.880 --> 3:31:36.880]  from the Chiapas Rebels literally
[3:31:36.880 --> 3:31:38.880]  in fact I'm gonna tell you a little story
[3:31:41.880 --> 3:31:42.880]  we had one
[3:31:42.880 --> 3:31:44.880]  I'm not sure if you want to believe it
[3:31:44.880 --> 3:31:46.880]  anyway so it's infowarstore.com
[3:31:46.880 --> 3:31:48.880]  and that's how we find this operation
[3:31:48.880 --> 3:31:49.880]  and if you don't find us
[3:31:49.880 --> 3:31:51.880]  and don't want to see it that's fine
[3:31:55.880 --> 3:31:57.880]  the globalist social engineers
[3:31:57.880 --> 3:31:59.880]  always intended to push
[3:31:59.880 --> 3:32:01.880]  their COVID biomedical tyranny
[3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:03.880]  lockdowns until
[3:32:03.880 --> 3:32:05.880]  the populations rebelled
[3:32:05.880 --> 3:32:08.880]  they would then use that as the pretext
[3:32:08.880 --> 3:32:09.880]  for permanent martial law
[3:32:09.880 --> 3:32:11.880]  and banning and arresting
[3:32:11.880 --> 3:32:13.880]  anybody that speaks out
[3:32:13.880 --> 3:32:14.880]  against their lives
[3:32:14.880 --> 3:32:16.880]  but because of so many sciences
[3:32:16.880 --> 3:32:18.880]  and engineers and researchers and others
[3:32:18.880 --> 3:32:21.880]  coming public and whistleblowers
[3:32:21.880 --> 3:32:23.880]  now their whole project is falling apart
[3:32:23.880 --> 3:32:25.880]  because the people are aware
[3:32:25.880 --> 3:32:29.880]  that it is a world government corporate takeover
[3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:31.880]  and so it's pulling back the curtain
[3:32:31.880 --> 3:32:33.880]  now more than ever
[3:32:33.880 --> 3:32:35.880]  the problem is some globalist controlled areas
[3:32:35.880 --> 3:32:37.880]  are not gonna give up on their takeover
[3:32:37.880 --> 3:32:38.880]  like Canada
[3:32:38.880 --> 3:32:41.880]  they've now declared a civil emergency
[3:32:41.880 --> 3:32:43.880]  in martial law in Ontario
[3:32:43.880 --> 3:32:45.880]  and other areas of the world are following suit
[3:32:45.880 --> 3:32:46.880]  like Australia
[3:32:46.880 --> 3:32:48.880]  so pray for these folks big time
[3:32:48.880 --> 3:32:50.880]  it's a very serious situation
[3:32:50.880 --> 3:32:52.880]  and stay tuned into infowarstore.com
[3:32:52.880 --> 3:33:04.880]  because truth is absolutely bare-mouth
[3:33:11.880 --> 3:33:13.880]  we are back this is the fourth hour
[3:33:13.880 --> 3:33:15.880]  of the Alex Jones show
[3:33:15.880 --> 3:33:18.880]  and before we get into some of the stories out there
[3:33:18.880 --> 3:33:20.880]  such as homeland security
[3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:22.880]  changing their language
[3:33:22.880 --> 3:33:25.880]  to include not just miss and disinformation
[3:33:25.880 --> 3:33:28.880]  but mal information
[3:33:28.880 --> 3:33:32.880]  as well in the CIA admitting
[3:33:32.880 --> 3:33:33.880]  water is wet
[3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:35.880]  the sun shines light
[3:33:35.880 --> 3:33:37.880]  and cows produce milk saying
[3:33:37.880 --> 3:33:40.880]  they have been collecting data
[3:33:40.880 --> 3:33:41.880]  on US citizens
[3:33:41.880 --> 3:33:44.880]  no kidding none of those are revelations
[3:33:44.880 --> 3:33:46.880]  we're going to show you
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:48.880]  how this leviathan
[3:33:48.880 --> 3:33:50.880]  of a military industrial complex
[3:33:50.880 --> 3:33:52.880]  has been tracking, tracing
[3:33:52.880 --> 3:33:55.880]  and databaseing US citizens
[3:33:55.880 --> 3:33:58.880]  since at least the 90s
[3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:00.880]  on a massive massive level
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:02.880]  but before we get there
[3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:05.880]  I got one more really feel good story
[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:07.880]  that no one else seems to be covering
[3:34:07.880 --> 3:34:09.880]  but I'm gonna cover it here
[3:34:09.880 --> 3:34:11.880]  I watched the opening ceremony
[3:34:11.880 --> 3:34:14.880]  of the Beijing Olympics
[3:34:14.880 --> 3:34:16.880]  and quite frankly
[3:34:16.880 --> 3:34:18.880]  I was a little sick to my stomach
[3:34:18.880 --> 3:34:19.880]  all right
[3:34:19.880 --> 3:34:22.880]  it was high high production value
[3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:24.880]  you had lasers
[3:34:24.880 --> 3:34:26.880]  and you had holograms
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:28.880]  and you had people you know
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:30.880]  dancing in unison as everybody came down
[3:34:30.880 --> 3:34:32.880]  but in the opening ceremony
[3:34:32.880 --> 3:34:35.880]  every single person involved
[3:34:35.880 --> 3:34:37.880]  Xi Jinping included
[3:34:37.880 --> 3:34:39.880]  the audience included
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:42.880]  all had the mark of slavery
[3:34:42.880 --> 3:34:45.880]  I want you to think about that for a moment
[3:34:45.880 --> 3:34:47.880]  and as each team
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:50.880]  went down the runway including the United States
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:52.880]  including even Canada
[3:34:52.880 --> 3:34:55.880]  they all wore the mark of slavery
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:34:57.880]  bending the knee
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:34:59.880]  physical specimens
[3:34:59.880 --> 3:35:01.880]  at the height
[3:35:01.880 --> 3:35:03.880]  at the height of athleticism
[3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:05.880]  and honestly very mentally strong people
[3:35:05.880 --> 3:35:06.880]  to get there
[3:35:06.880 --> 3:35:08.880]  well one person
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:10.880]  one young lady
[3:35:10.880 --> 3:35:13.880]  a 21 year old skier from Iran
[3:35:13.880 --> 3:35:15.880]  and I hate I don't even want to try
[3:35:15.880 --> 3:35:16.880]  her last name is Ahmadi
[3:35:16.880 --> 3:35:18.880]  I believe it's Atifa
[3:35:18.880 --> 3:35:19.880]  okay
[3:35:19.880 --> 3:35:21.880]  she refused to bend the knee
[3:35:21.880 --> 3:35:23.880]  one person
[3:35:23.880 --> 3:35:24.880]  okay
[3:35:24.880 --> 3:35:27.880]  I think there's again three Iranians
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:28.880]  that are actually even competing
[3:35:28.880 --> 3:35:30.880]  she's one of three
[3:35:30.880 --> 3:35:31.880]  all right
[3:35:31.880 --> 3:35:32.880]  think about being a woman in her country
[3:35:32.880 --> 3:35:34.880]  everybody talks about
[3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:36.880]  the axes of evil and oppression
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:38.880]  and the culture that's built
[3:35:38.880 --> 3:35:39.880]  she refused
[3:35:39.880 --> 3:35:41.880]  she made everybody see that
[3:35:41.880 --> 3:35:43.880]  a Canadian smile as she should
[3:35:43.880 --> 3:35:45.880]  because she worked so damn hard to get there
[3:35:45.880 --> 3:35:47.880]  and again
[3:35:47.880 --> 3:35:49.880]  in the face of global tyranny
[3:35:49.880 --> 3:35:51.880]  and slavery she said no
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:53.880]  not going to happen
[3:35:53.880 --> 3:35:55.880]  and I commend that on a massive level
[3:35:55.880 --> 3:35:56.880]  so
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:35:58.880]  moving on
[3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:00.880]  this just came out
[3:36:00.880 --> 3:36:02.880]  anybody can go and get the PDF
[3:36:02.880 --> 3:36:04.880]  this was on the 7th
[3:36:04.880 --> 3:36:06.880]  and a lot of people are highlighting
[3:36:06.880 --> 3:36:08.880]  this line right here which does need to be highlighted
[3:36:08.880 --> 3:36:10.880]  because it's the number one thing
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:12.880]  at this summary of a terrorism threat
[3:36:12.880 --> 3:36:14.880]  in the U.S. homeland
[3:36:14.880 --> 3:36:16.880]  and they talk about the proliferation of false
[3:36:16.880 --> 3:36:18.880]  or misleading narratives
[3:36:18.880 --> 3:36:20.880]  which so discord or undermine
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:22.880]  public trust
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:24.880]  in U.S. government institutions
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:26.880]  but really
[3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:28.880]  what we need to focus on
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:30.880]  is this first sentence
[3:36:30.880 --> 3:36:32.880]  because that's where it goes from
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:34.880]  just misinformation
[3:36:34.880 --> 3:36:36.880]  or disinformation
[3:36:36.880 --> 3:36:38.880]  false information and conspiracy theories
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:40.880]  all right
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:42.880]  false or misleading narratives
[3:36:42.880 --> 3:36:44.880]  and conspiracy theories
[3:36:44.880 --> 3:36:46.880]  but malinformation
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:48.880]  what is malinformation
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:50.880]  well obviously malinformation
[3:36:50.880 --> 3:36:52.880]  is something that you could contest
[3:36:52.880 --> 3:36:54.880]  doesn't really exist
[3:36:54.880 --> 3:36:56.880]  other than it is harmful to the narrative
[3:36:56.880 --> 3:36:58.880]  in other words it can be 100%
[3:36:58.880 --> 3:37:00.880]  truthful
[3:37:00.880 --> 3:37:02.880]  okay and one of the things
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:04.880]  that was featured
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:06.880]  in the spars pandemic
[3:37:06.880 --> 3:37:08.880]  the document right here
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:10.880]  was such a thing
[3:37:10.880 --> 3:37:12.880]  and the control of these narratives
[3:37:12.880 --> 3:37:14.880]  and even the societies
[3:37:14.880 --> 3:37:16.880]  including echo chambers
[3:37:16.880 --> 3:37:18.880]  but then the one they like the most
[3:37:18.880 --> 3:37:20.880]  first of all let's read this
[3:37:20.880 --> 3:37:22.880]  through social media these individuals can find
[3:37:22.880 --> 3:37:24.880]  both practical information
[3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:26.880]  and a sense of community
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:28.880]  in other words right information
[3:37:28.880 --> 3:37:30.880]  correct information
[3:37:30.880 --> 3:37:32.880]  okay but
[3:37:32.880 --> 3:37:34.880]  they won't focus on what we want them to
[3:37:34.880 --> 3:37:36.880]  and that's a problem
[3:37:36.880 --> 3:37:38.880]  they'd rather have
[3:37:38.880 --> 3:37:40.880]  we got to scroll down just a little bit further
[3:37:40.880 --> 3:37:42.880]  I think it's a big document
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:44.880]  they would rather have the UN model
[3:37:44.880 --> 3:37:46.880]  and again we're all under
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:48.880]  this there it is
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:50.880]  UN Security Council
[3:37:50.880 --> 3:37:52.880]  that's the one they want right there
[3:37:52.880 --> 3:37:54.880]  yes
[3:37:54.880 --> 3:37:56.880]  diverse and integrated
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:37:58.880]  in a melting pot
[3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:00.880]  sure
[3:38:00.880 --> 3:38:02.880]  and to really you know
[3:38:02.880 --> 3:38:04.880]  out there again
[3:38:04.880 --> 3:38:06.880]  that they have been
[3:38:06.880 --> 3:38:08.880]  tracking tracing and databaseing us
[3:38:08.880 --> 3:38:10.880]  they've been deep diving
[3:38:10.880 --> 3:38:12.880]  on us for years and years and years
[3:38:12.880 --> 3:38:14.880]  I'm going to play a clip
[3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:16.880]  from the infowars.com produced
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:18.880]  documentary and by the way
[3:38:18.880 --> 3:38:20.880]  you should go get covidland to the mask right now
[3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:22.880]  you want to support that broadcast
[3:38:22.880 --> 3:38:24.880]  you want to support the whole operation
[3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:26.880]  and independent filmmaking
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:28.880]  you need to go get that picture
[3:38:28.880 --> 3:38:30.880]  Paul Wittenberger has done a great job
[3:38:30.880 --> 3:38:32.880]  so far with that series
[3:38:32.880 --> 3:38:34.880]  however you look at this
[3:38:34.880 --> 3:38:36.880]  and this was produced all the way back in 2010
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:38.880]  we're going to be talking about
[3:38:38.880 --> 3:38:40.880]  a program that was outed
[3:38:40.880 --> 3:38:42.880]  via hepting versus AT&T
[3:38:42.880 --> 3:38:44.880]  so it should come as no surprise
[3:38:44.880 --> 3:38:46.880]  that they have been tracking tracing
[3:38:46.880 --> 3:38:48.880]  and databaseing our lives for years
[3:38:48.880 --> 3:38:50.880]  many people are aware that the bush administration
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:52.880]  engaged in warrantless wiretaps on American citizens
[3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:54.880]  what they don't understand
[3:38:54.880 --> 3:38:56.880]  is that has come out in court
[3:38:56.880 --> 3:38:58.880]  that all the major telecommunications companies
[3:38:58.880 --> 3:39:00.880]  have been secretly storing every piece of data
[3:39:00.880 --> 3:39:02.880]  received from our phones and our computers
[3:39:02.880 --> 3:39:04.880]  and handing them over to the national security agency
[3:39:04.880 --> 3:39:06.880]  you heard about the government
[3:39:06.880 --> 3:39:08.880]  secretly listening in on phone conversations
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:10.880]  without a warrant
[3:39:10.880 --> 3:39:12.880]  but there is evidence that your email
[3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:14.880]  is also being tapped
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:16.880]  the government has been intercepting most emails
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:18.880]  as part of its terrorist surveillance program
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:20.880]  that program has been
[3:39:20.880 --> 3:39:22.880]  criticized as illegal
[3:39:22.880 --> 3:39:24.880]  because it's missing an important ingredient
[3:39:24.880 --> 3:39:26.880]  search warrants several years ago
[3:39:26.880 --> 3:39:28.880]  Klein says he came to suspect
[3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:30.880]  that AT&T had installed
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:32.880]  secret computer gear
[3:39:32.880 --> 3:39:34.880]  designed to spy on internet traffic
[3:39:34.880 --> 3:39:36.880]  at the request of the national security agency
[3:39:36.880 --> 3:39:38.880]  this is just a small part of the picture
[3:39:38.880 --> 3:39:40.880]  as AT&T was not the only company involved
[3:39:40.880 --> 3:39:42.880]  and emails were not the only issue
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:44.880]  the NSA was installing
[3:39:44.880 --> 3:39:46.880]  Norris in-site systems
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:48.880]  which are capable of monitoring
[3:39:48.880 --> 3:39:50.880]  billions of bits of internet traffic per second
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:52.880]  it was also able to monitor
[3:39:52.880 --> 3:39:54.880]  any calls traffic through its system
[3:39:54.880 --> 3:39:56.880]  all websites visited
[3:39:56.880 --> 3:39:58.880]  all instant messaging and separate types of transaction records
[3:39:58.880 --> 3:40:00.880]  so again
[3:40:00.880 --> 3:40:02.880]  when that revelation came out
[3:40:02.880 --> 3:40:04.880]  from Edward Snowden
[3:40:04.880 --> 3:40:06.880]  just understand info wars beat him to the punch
[3:40:06.880 --> 3:40:08.880]  quite a bit
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:10.880]  it continues
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:12.880]  and then we'll get into
[3:40:12.880 --> 3:40:14.880]  this gets into the CIA and other agencies
[3:40:14.880 --> 3:40:16.880]  and MIAC and why DHS putting that memo out
[3:40:16.880 --> 3:40:18.880]  DHS shouldn't exist
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:20.880]  Deutschland security shouldn't exist
[3:40:20.880 --> 3:40:22.880]  the secret room at AT&T
[3:40:22.880 --> 3:40:24.880]  contains gear
[3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:26.880]  which enables the government
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:28.880]  to look at every individual message
[3:40:28.880 --> 3:40:30.880]  on the internet
[3:40:30.880 --> 3:40:32.880]  and analyze exactly what people are doing
[3:40:32.880 --> 3:40:34.880]  here's another document
[3:40:34.880 --> 3:40:36.880]  it mentions a company called Norris
[3:40:36.880 --> 3:40:38.880]  Norris makes computer software
[3:40:38.880 --> 3:40:40.880]  that can swallow and analyze
[3:40:40.880 --> 3:40:42.880]  10 gigabytes of information
[3:40:42.880 --> 3:40:44.880]  every second
[3:40:44.880 --> 3:40:46.880]  that means it could go through all the information
[3:40:46.880 --> 3:40:48.880]  in all the books in the Library of Congress
[3:40:48.880 --> 3:40:50.880]  in a little over 15 minutes
[3:40:50.880 --> 3:40:52.880]  the documents Klein and others were able to produce
[3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:54.880]  were then censored by the NSA
[3:40:54.880 --> 3:40:56.880]  Bankston isn't allowed to talk about the documents
[3:40:56.880 --> 3:40:58.880]  in detail
[3:40:58.880 --> 3:41:00.880]  the government has since had them sealed
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:02.880]  but he says what is in there
[3:41:02.880 --> 3:41:04.880]  boggles the mind
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:06.880]  I want you to think about that right now
[3:41:06.880 --> 3:41:08.880]  they actually had to reclassify
[3:41:08.880 --> 3:41:10.880]  documents
[3:41:10.880 --> 3:41:12.880]  try finding information
[3:41:12.880 --> 3:41:14.880]  on this case
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:16.880]  Mark Klein wasn't the only one
[3:41:16.880 --> 3:41:18.880]  that blew the whistle
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:20.880]  okay and even the documentation
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:22.880]  that had been out there
[3:41:22.880 --> 3:41:24.880]  they said no no no
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:26.880]  we got to take that back
[3:41:26.880 --> 3:41:28.880]  we got to restrict one of the big revelations
[3:41:28.880 --> 3:41:30.880]  from Snowden that I think
[3:41:30.880 --> 3:41:32.880]  is important is the fact
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:34.880]  that he came across documentation
[3:41:34.880 --> 3:41:36.880]  that was not only blacked out
[3:41:36.880 --> 3:41:38.880]  right but it was a completely
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:40.880]  other document
[3:41:40.880 --> 3:41:42.880]  in other words your declassified
[3:41:42.880 --> 3:41:44.880]  or partially classified version
[3:41:44.880 --> 3:41:46.880]  was completely fraudulent
[3:41:46.880 --> 3:41:48.880]  that should alarm you
[3:41:48.880 --> 3:41:50.880]  we are talking about a substantial portion
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:52.880]  of all the communications traffic
[3:41:52.880 --> 3:41:54.880]  in the United States
[3:41:54.880 --> 3:41:56.880]  the policies have been shielded by the Obama Administration
[3:41:56.880 --> 3:41:58.880]  and continue to this day
[3:41:58.880 --> 3:42:00.880]  Attorney General Holder has publicly stated
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:02.880]  lawsuits be thrown out of court
[3:42:02.880 --> 3:42:04.880]  and after several attempts
[3:42:04.880 --> 3:42:06.880]  Klein and other cases were thrown out as well
[3:42:06.880 --> 3:42:08.880]  once again citing the national security
[3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:10.880]  of what used to be a constitutional republic
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:12.880]  not a massive corrupt slave state
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:14.880]  living in the New World Order
[3:42:14.880 --> 3:42:16.880]  so you know there's Mark Dyson
[3:42:16.880 --> 3:42:18.880]  he's talking about the New World Order
[3:42:18.880 --> 3:42:20.880]  also does great stuff
[3:42:20.880 --> 3:42:22.880]  on the other side we're going to play just a small portion of that
[3:42:22.880 --> 3:42:24.880]  we're going to show you how blockchain technology
[3:42:24.880 --> 3:42:26.880]  is literally being promoted
[3:42:26.880 --> 3:42:28.880]  by the World Economic Forum
[3:42:28.880 --> 3:42:30.880]  to enslave people
[3:42:30.880 --> 3:42:32.880]  not empower you
[3:42:32.880 --> 3:42:34.880]  through decentralization
[3:42:34.880 --> 3:42:36.880]  we're not an imagination land
[3:42:36.880 --> 3:42:38.880]  we're coming back final segment
[3:42:38.880 --> 3:42:40.880]  of the Alex Jones show
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:42.880]  and Bermas sitting in
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:44.880]  and you need to support infowars.com
[3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:46.880]  by going to infowarsstore.com
[3:42:46.880 --> 3:42:48.880]  right now getting the supplements
[3:42:48.880 --> 3:42:50.880]  or getting some of the great motion pictures
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:52.880]  they provide so you can wake
[3:42:52.880 --> 3:43:20.880]  people up we'll see on the other side
[3:43:22.880 --> 3:43:24.880]  suppressing the voices
[3:43:24.880 --> 3:43:26.880]  of good people all around the world
[3:43:26.880 --> 3:43:28.880]  and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[3:43:28.880 --> 3:43:30.880]  that are exposing
[3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:32.880]  all their lives their COVID
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:34.880]  hysteria their world's going to end
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:36.880]  in 2030 carbon tax
[3:43:36.880 --> 3:43:38.880]  global warming bull all of it
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:40.880]  and none of it can succeed
[3:43:40.880 --> 3:43:42.880]  none of it can actually be carried out
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:44.880]  unless everybody is silenced
[3:43:44.880 --> 3:43:46.880]  and gas lit and that's why truth
[3:43:46.880 --> 3:43:48.880]  comes with hard work
[3:43:48.880 --> 3:43:50.880]  and with research and with diligence
[3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:52.880]  and with effort to share infowars links
[3:43:52.880 --> 3:43:54.880]  and band up video links
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:22.880]  share them now more than ever
[3:44:22.880 --> 3:44:24.880]  I also need you to wear masks
[3:44:24.880 --> 3:44:26.880]  and I also need you
[3:44:26.880 --> 3:44:28.880]  to only shop
[3:44:28.880 --> 3:44:30.880]  at mega corporations
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:32.880]  that way we can consolidate
[3:44:32.880 --> 3:44:34.880]  control
[3:44:34.880 --> 3:44:36.880]  and bankrupt the world economy
[3:44:36.880 --> 3:44:38.880]  leaving companies that only
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:40.880]  I own
[3:44:40.880 --> 3:44:42.880]  profitable you will then
[3:44:42.880 --> 3:44:44.880]  be my slaves
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:46.880]  and then you'll get that
[3:44:46.880 --> 3:44:48.880]  special shot of them from Cobra
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:50.880]  will remove your immune system
[3:44:50.880 --> 3:44:52.880]  so you'll be dependent on me
[3:44:52.880 --> 3:45:20.880]  for the rest of your miserable lives
[3:45:52.880 --> 3:45:54.880]  and band up video links
