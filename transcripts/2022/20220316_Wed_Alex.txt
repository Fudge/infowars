[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  But there's been a little change in the arrangement who's on the stage because of the first lady's
[00:24.000 --> 00:30.000]  husband contracting COVID, but look at this room and what you see.
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  Pardon?
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  That's right.
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  She's fine.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  It's me.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  That's not together.
[00:43.000 --> 00:46.000]  The second lady, the first gentleman.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  How about that?
[00:50.000 --> 00:57.000]  Anyway, it's all fun and games, folks. It's all a big joke.
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  As people are dying in Ukraine, our politicians are in on the gag.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  It's all a big, sick joke.
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  Jen Psaki cutting it up yesterday with the establishment media Democrat activists during her press conference.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  She's cutting it up talking about the Russian sanctions.
[01:17.000 --> 01:19.000]  Oh, it's all just a joke.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  Oh, Russia doesn't even know that it's Biden Jr.
[01:22.000 --> 01:24.000]  So I guess his dead father got sanctioned.
[01:24.000 --> 01:28.000]  And then the press laughs.
[01:28.000 --> 01:32.000]  Then you have Biden who, I guess, tests positive for COVID.
[01:32.000 --> 01:35.000]  I mean, he's not up there wearing a mask.
[01:35.000 --> 01:36.000]  He's not quarantined.
[01:36.000 --> 01:37.000]  He's addressing Congress.
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  Kamala Harris, his husband, apparently has COVID too.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  I don't even care.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  Somebody tests positive for COVID, wants to come to work, doesn't bother me one bit.
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  I'm not afraid.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  And we've had enough real world experience now being around COVID,
[01:50.000 --> 01:53.000]  being around people with COVID that it's okay.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  It's okay.
[01:56.000 --> 01:57.000]  But it's all a joke.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  Biden, the first lady's husband has COVID.
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.000]  That's you, Joe.
[02:04.000 --> 02:09.000]  Ha ha ha ha ha, says the American media.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  It's all just a joke.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  And then Lindsey Graham, he's never seen a war.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  He didn't want you to die in.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  He's never seen a war.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.260]  or he didn't want someone else to die in.
[02:17.260 --> 02:19.020]  Lindsey Graham gives a press conference today
[02:19.020 --> 02:20.980]  after the Zelensky press conference of Congress.
[02:20.980 --> 02:22.980]  He's laughing it up, he's cutting up jokes.
[02:22.980 --> 02:24.780]  Oh, let's send drones, let's send missiles.
[02:24.780 --> 02:26.020]  You know, pretty much anything to Ukraine,
[02:26.020 --> 02:27.540]  except nuclear, except nuclear.
[02:27.540 --> 02:28.500]  And the media laughs.
[02:28.500 --> 02:31.220]  He's like, oh, what's a, what's a switchblade drone?
[02:31.220 --> 02:32.740]  Sounds great, let's send those too.
[02:32.740 --> 02:33.900]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[02:36.780 --> 02:39.940]  Russia's losing, Russia's losing, Russia's losing.
[02:39.940 --> 02:43.460]  And then you see Zelensky pretty much on his knees
[02:43.460 --> 02:47.740]  begging the US to save him and save Ukraine.
[02:47.740 --> 02:51.640]  Oh, but Russia's losing, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[02:53.220 --> 02:54.640]  And they just think you're so stupid,
[02:54.640 --> 02:57.900]  you're gonna believe conflicting messages
[02:59.740 --> 03:00.860]  at the same time.
[03:01.940 --> 03:06.560]  You know, here's what the stance should be
[03:06.560 --> 03:08.400]  from the average American person,
[03:08.400 --> 03:12.680]  even if you're opinionated on this subject material,
[03:12.680 --> 03:15.880]  whatever your emotions towards Russia or Putin
[03:15.880 --> 03:18.440]  or Ukraine and Zelensky, here's what should be
[03:18.440 --> 03:21.760]  the common sense, universal approach to this
[03:21.760 --> 03:22.960]  from the American people.
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.240]  And that is, I'm sick of being lied to,
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.920]  I want nothing to do with this.
[03:31.400 --> 03:34.000]  Okay, it's sad what's happening in Ukraine.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.280]  There's death on both sides,
[03:35.280 --> 03:38.640]  there's innocent civilians getting slaughtered.
[03:38.640 --> 03:43.640]  But I'm sick and tired of being lied to
[03:43.880 --> 03:45.920]  about what's going on in Ukraine,
[03:45.920 --> 03:50.680]  so why would I want to invest anything in that region?
[03:50.680 --> 03:55.680]  Why would I want to invest anything in that conflict
[03:56.540 --> 03:58.960]  when I can't trust anything
[03:58.960 --> 04:02.500]  as far as information goes coming out of Ukraine?
[04:02.500 --> 04:05.480]  Why would I want anything to do with that?
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.200]  We've been lied to constantly since day one
[04:11.680 --> 04:13.840]  of Russia going into Ukraine
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.960]  all the way up to whatever day we're on now,
[04:15.960 --> 04:19.500]  probably around, I guess, three or more weeks.
[04:20.840 --> 04:23.280]  And we've been lied to since day one.
[04:23.280 --> 04:26.640]  Why would I trust any of the information coming out?
[04:26.640 --> 04:29.720]  And why would I want to invest anything
[04:29.720 --> 04:33.720]  as far as financially, emotionally, physically?
[04:33.720 --> 04:36.640]  Why would I want to do anything involving Ukraine
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.320]  when I'm being lied to about it 24 seven?
[04:39.320 --> 04:40.840]  No, thank you.
[04:40.840 --> 04:42.400]  That should be the common sense
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.000]  average Americans' response to this.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.600]  But we got Warhawks on both sides of the aisle
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.720]  from the Bidens to the Pelosi's to the Graham's
[04:49.720 --> 04:50.880]  to the Romney's,
[04:52.280 --> 04:54.720]  Alex Jones with his response to all of this coming up next.
[04:54.720 --> 04:59.720]  But all Russia's losing as Ukraine begs for help.
[05:01.280 --> 05:06.280]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March, 2022.
[05:06.520 --> 05:07.720]  And in the month of February,
[05:07.720 --> 05:10.480]  we had a very popular sale that was going
[05:10.480 --> 05:13.200]  of our flagship product, X3.
[05:13.200 --> 05:16.240]  That has all three types of the amazing iodine
[05:16.240 --> 05:19.360]  your body needs for every electrochemical
[05:19.360 --> 05:21.920]  cellular activity in your body,
[05:21.920 --> 05:24.640]  your immune system, your stamina, your libido,
[05:24.640 --> 05:25.480]  so much.
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.560]  And the majority of the population in the world
[05:27.560 --> 05:29.280]  is iodine deficient.
[05:29.280 --> 05:30.800]  This is the very best iodine output.
[05:30.800 --> 05:33.040]  So we had on sale 50% off,
[05:33.040 --> 05:35.440]  but we sold more than half of what we have
[05:35.440 --> 05:37.280]  or isn't going to come in for a long time.
[05:37.280 --> 05:39.440]  So I took it back to full process.
[05:39.440 --> 05:40.880]  I was just thinking, you know what?
[05:40.880 --> 05:43.240]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.600]  Plus this is the right product everybody needs.
[05:45.600 --> 05:48.480]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence
[05:48.480 --> 05:50.320]  to get X3 and experience it yourself
[05:50.320 --> 05:51.760]  and support the broadcast,
[05:51.760 --> 05:55.200]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[05:55.200 --> 05:58.280]  Get X3 right now exclusively at infowarstore.com
[05:58.280 --> 05:59.640]  for 50% off.
[06:03.400 --> 06:08.600]  And it's time for humanity to stand up
[06:08.600 --> 06:10.080]  in the info war and say,
[06:10.080 --> 06:12.240]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[06:12.240 --> 06:15.840]  but you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[06:17.840 --> 06:21.360]  From the front lines of the information war,
[06:21.360 --> 06:23.200]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:46.480 --> 06:48.200]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[06:48.200 --> 06:51.240]  you're listening to the Wednesday
[06:51.240 --> 07:00.120]  March 16th, 2022 edition of the Alex Jones show. I'm your host Alex Jones. We have news of the
[07:00.120 --> 07:07.720]  utmost importance to break down right now dealing with the ongoing Ukraine conflict spiraling
[07:07.720 --> 07:15.880]  out of control. This information cannot simply be lost in the sea of other factoids and developments.
[07:15.880 --> 07:25.080]  This is paramount to ending the conflict in Ukraine and this is the reason that Vladimir Putin
[07:25.080 --> 07:37.240]  invaded Ukraine. The CIA today has declassified that they have been in a proxy war with U.S. troops
[07:37.240 --> 07:46.360]  fighting the Russians since 2014. There have been casualties on both sides, thousands of them.
[07:47.240 --> 07:54.520]  This has been suppressed. This has been covered up. The CIA has been directing a foreign legion
[07:55.160 --> 08:02.360]  of people as far away as Australia, people as close as Poland, Germany, France, the UK,
[08:02.360 --> 08:11.000]  USA, leading the Ukrainians in an attempt to retake the eastern areas that the Russians took
[08:11.000 --> 08:21.720]  over in 2014. There is a giant article in Yahoo News today, exclusive secret CIA training program
[08:21.720 --> 08:26.600]  in Ukraine helped Kiev prepare for Russian invasion. Now, I'm going to go over the article here,
[08:26.600 --> 08:33.560]  but here's the real takeaway. This is why Putin came in and this is what Putin was talking about,
[08:33.560 --> 08:39.080]  the heavy weapons, the training coming in and NATO backing it and basically how Zelensky was
[08:39.080 --> 08:45.000]  openly saying that they were becoming a NATO slash EU state when they had promised previously to be a
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.880]  neutral buffer zone. So this wasn't just weapons being moved in. This was the U.S. in a covert war
[08:51.880 --> 09:00.360]  with U.S. troops directly commanding forces, killing Russians and Russian separatists in the
[09:00.360 --> 09:09.160]  eastern areas. Think about that. Now, also another large point here, and I'll get to the main point.
[09:10.120 --> 09:17.480]  You, of course, have heard this here exclusively on Info Wars for years and that's because I could
[09:17.480 --> 09:24.520]  go into Congressional funding and see the classified earmarks going in and then I talked to my extensive
[09:24.520 --> 09:33.800]  connections in the U.S. military who would just go, yeah, they're over there training people to
[09:33.800 --> 09:38.440]  fight the Russians and then I made some other contacts and of course it was revealed to me
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.760]  that it was a CIA operation, but that would obviously be who would be in charge of it.
[09:42.760 --> 09:47.880]  I didn't even need people who've worked for and with and in the CIA to tell me that,
[09:47.880 --> 09:53.000]  but I have that from at least five sources including two of them that have been in the
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.480]  combat with the Russians and I've told you this dozens of times here on air and the reason that's
[09:59.480 --> 10:06.120]  important is I wasn't just surmising that we were in a proxy war over there and surmising that
[10:06.120 --> 10:12.200]  George Soros brags on CNN that he overthrew Ukraine in 2014 and put their puppet in on
[10:12.200 --> 10:17.400]  Fareed Zarkaria or he goes on C-SPAN and says he's the emperor of Russia and he's going to overthrow
[10:17.400 --> 10:27.480]  all those countries to precipitate the Russians to invade, to defensively take back an area
[10:28.920 --> 10:35.960]  being used by military forces against them. It's called a counter offensive. When a government
[10:35.960 --> 10:43.000]  next door to you historically is basically your people is overthrown and then you have a
[10:43.000 --> 10:49.480]  separatist area that's being shelled and attacked for years and the CIA is directing those attacks.
[10:50.920 --> 10:56.120]  What do you expect Russia to do? I don't want Russia to invade. I didn't want this to happen.
[10:56.120 --> 11:02.520]  I want peace, but I also understand the facts of George Soros and the globalist and Obama
[11:02.520 --> 11:08.200]  and this continued under Trump and Trump sent in the anti-tank missiles for them as well,
[11:08.920 --> 11:15.320]  escalating this crisis. The truth is Trump was very hard on Russia, put huge sanctions on them
[11:15.320 --> 11:20.920]  and threatened to nuke Russia and attack Moscow if they attack Kiev. That's why they didn't attack
[11:21.480 --> 11:26.600]  and so Trump was a big part of this escalation for all of you out there on the left claiming he was
[11:26.600 --> 11:33.720]  pro-Russia. That's just preposterous. In fact, all their lies about him being pro-Russia made
[11:33.720 --> 11:38.360]  him become more hardline and basically helped push Putin into this position. I'm not attacking
[11:38.360 --> 11:43.800]  Trump. I'm just laying out the real players and the real facts, but this sits squarely at the
[11:43.800 --> 11:51.640]  Democrats and the Eastern establishment's feet. Here's the most important point. Why is the CIA
[11:51.640 --> 11:56.680]  now speaking to Yahoo News and why is this being pushed everywhere? Because they think you're stupid.
[11:57.400 --> 12:02.040]  Previous to the Russians fully invading and responding to this offensive against them
[12:02.600 --> 12:07.800]  and their sovereignty and their security, you would hear, oh, there's no Western people over
[12:07.800 --> 12:12.360]  there. There's no support. The U.S. isn't doing anything. We're not involved, even though all
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.760]  the money and training was obviously going into the evidence was there. But now that the world's
[12:16.760 --> 12:22.600]  firmly turned against Russia, now that Russia is clearly starting to lose, now they can brag and go,
[12:22.600 --> 12:28.360]  yes, we were there the whole time training the people to fight these evil Russians and then
[12:28.360 --> 12:36.440]  brand that offensive as a defensive operation. So this is really, really disgusting. And this is
[12:36.440 --> 12:40.680]  how they manage history. It's how they control people. And I just want to live in peace. I don't
[12:40.680 --> 12:45.640]  want a bunch of wars. I don't want $8 gallon gas. And I don't want U.S. troops over there dying
[12:45.640 --> 12:53.400]  in an inter-Slavic civil war conflict. And then the cherry on top is having the entire corporate
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.560]  establishment media that said we were all Russian agents because we wanted to secure the border
[12:57.560 --> 13:03.640]  and secure the dollar and secure our military and secure our children's futures. We all get called
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.920]  Russian agents while you've got the Clintons and the globalists up to their eyeballs getting money
[13:08.920 --> 13:13.160]  from the Russians, who they've been double dealing with as well as the Communist Chinese.
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.720]  And all this does is push the world away from America and push China and Russia together
[13:17.720 --> 13:24.680]  closer and starts hurting the dollar long term. So there's a larger global force that's manipulating
[13:24.680 --> 13:29.640]  all this. And now they're going to use this conflict to track and control money, to bring in the
[13:29.640 --> 13:35.560]  cashless society, social credit score grid on the back of COVID. They used to cover up what
[13:35.560 --> 13:40.440]  really happened with COVID, right, as that was starting to blow up in their face and really
[13:40.440 --> 13:45.640]  threaten their whole system. And then it allows them to call Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, Tulsi Gabbards,
[13:45.640 --> 13:51.160]  all sorts of people, Russian agents and traitors and treasonists because we can find Ukraine on a
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.200]  map. We know the history. We understand that we don't support what Putin did, but we understand
[13:56.200 --> 14:02.760]  the West was provocative and basically pushed them into it. And then the Russian intelligence
[14:02.760 --> 14:07.720]  agencies told Putin that he could win quickly, which was total disinformation. I was saying that
[14:07.720 --> 14:12.280]  three plus weeks ago, I said, he's going to go into a trap unless he successfully bought off
[14:12.280 --> 14:18.120]  all these groups. And I knew the CIA had been in their training, folks. So I believe they were
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.880]  going to put up major stiff resistance. And so now you've seen that. So that's the full spectrum
[14:23.880 --> 14:27.720]  analysis. Owen Stroyer is about to take over. I want to thank all the listeners for keeping us
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.040]  on the air. Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that we've got a bunch of great

[16:31.640 --> 16:35.880]  but we sold more than half of what we have, or isn't going to come in for a long time.

[18:02.040 --> 18:06.120]  now, take advantage of this moment and I have all of an idea that something everybody can do,
[18:06.120 --> 18:11.000]  but every listener can do. I think it'd be powerful and effective for us to hang banners over
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.640]  highways. Imagine a champion, an artiste, a layman, a painter. It says Alex Jones is right
[18:15.640 --> 18:21.000]  InfoWars.com. We stand with the troopers, a rest out or whatever. Brother, I'm so glad you called
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.120]  elaborate on this. Yes, now is the time in your small town or your big city to write something on
[18:26.120 --> 18:32.120]  the bathroom wall or to put a sticker on your car or banner hangs over highways and it will be a
[18:32.120 --> 18:36.200]  chain reaction. What do you recommend people say on these banner hangs? I have a few ideas.
[18:44.600 --> 18:49.400]  I agree. A rest fouchy, arrest bill gates, the COVID-19 backs is poison. Beautiful.
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.000]  Yeah, there's ways that we could all be involved and we could all be effective though. That's what
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.960]  I'm calling about. God bless you Chris. In Atlanta, I really, really appreciate you calling us today.

[20:00.520 --> 20:06.520]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.320]  Again, welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm sure it was about to take over here in about
[20:19.320 --> 20:24.440]  three minutes but I wanted to just recap and finish up what I was covering in that last critical
[20:24.440 --> 20:31.560]  segment. The CIA and the State Department are now openly bragging in a Yahoo News article
[20:31.560 --> 20:37.800]  that will put on screen exclusive secret CIA training program in Ukraine, help Kiev prepare
[20:37.800 --> 20:44.520]  for Russian invasion and ended it says they went over there in 2014 and decided on whether or not
[20:44.520 --> 20:51.720]  they could launch a major operation to train them as a paramilitary with sabotage operations and
[20:51.720 --> 20:58.280]  major resistance operations as a stay-behind network and of course the U.S. had already done this
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.320]  during the Cold War as well all over Eastern Europe setting up similar stay-behind networks so most
[21:03.320 --> 21:10.040]  these men's fathers and grandfathers had already worked with the CIA and with NATO and the Pentagon
[21:10.040 --> 21:15.080]  many of them have been trained for bending Georgia and many other areas school of America's and so
[21:16.200 --> 21:21.960]  these networks were then beefed up and then they gave the report back two years later in 2016
[21:22.920 --> 21:28.120]  that indeed they were ready to fight and so then you could have sorrows in the media start the
[21:28.120 --> 21:32.520]  drumroll and start saying they were going to control Ukraine, Ukraine was NATO and they were
[21:32.520 --> 21:40.200]  going to put missiles on Russia's border to antagonize Russia into invading and Russia has now rolled
[21:40.200 --> 21:47.480]  right in to a gigantic trap exclusive secret CIA training program in Ukraine helped Kiev
[21:48.520 --> 21:53.000]  prepare for Russian invasion Ukrainian snipers had a problem Russian forces in Eastern Ukraine
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.160]  were trying to blind them oh that's right and so it goes into how they were victims and how
[21:59.160 --> 22:05.240]  terrible it was and then oh but the CIA then sent people in and started training everybody and they
[22:05.240 --> 22:10.520]  were great people and they were going to resist they were going to win you've got to go read this
[22:10.520 --> 22:17.240]  for yourself how they killed Russian generals and sniper attacks and again how they were battling
[22:17.240 --> 22:22.200]  the Russians in those Russian held areas in the east that the Russians said they took because the
[22:22.200 --> 22:28.120]  Russian citizens that lived there for thousands of years with their families family lines were
[22:28.120 --> 22:37.000]  being attacked and it's all here in this article spinning it and pushing it and admitting that
[22:38.760 --> 22:44.600]  they've done this so we've been at war with Russia with US troops commanding forces in the field
[22:45.400 --> 22:51.960]  since 2014 at least the year that the US government with Soros overthrew their elected
[22:51.960 --> 22:57.800]  president so there you have it and now the world's on the edge of nuclear war and the CIA's overthrown
[22:57.800 --> 23:01.480]  hundreds of governments in its history and now it's basically overthrown the US government by
[23:01.480 --> 23:07.640]  stealing the election in 2020 and we all know it because it's not a group that works for America
[23:07.640 --> 23:12.760]  it works for global corporations and it sold our country out and it's despicable so it's a big story
[23:13.480 --> 23:20.120]  a big story that the US overthrew that government and then started a paramilitary war with the
[23:20.120 --> 23:26.440]  Russians and then the Russians got punched in the nose enough to actually invade and are now in a
[23:26.440 --> 23:33.000]  giant bear trap in full wars dot com tomorrow's news today i just wish we could all have peace
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.760]  and i just wish we could all get control of our governments again and not be run by these
[23:36.760 --> 23:41.400]  bureaucracies these intelligence agencies but we are run by them and we know what their agenda is
[23:41.400 --> 23:46.920]  break up our families make us poor dumb us down give us eight dollar gallon gas so this is these
[23:46.920 --> 23:50.840]  are not american groups and they've got some of our best people our military working for them
[23:50.840 --> 23:56.120]  uh and it's it's just a very sad thing and they're having their crt critical race theory
[23:56.680 --> 24:00.760]  divide and conquer program to call out the good people out of the military and then the military
[24:00.760 --> 24:05.240]  will be fully an instrument of these globalists and then we're all in great trouble and while
[24:05.240 --> 24:12.280]  the cia is battling the russians uh in ukraine our borders are wide open and joe biden has declared
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.240]  the american people who support trump or support borders or question elections to be terrorists
[24:17.240 --> 24:22.040]  who are imminently about the state's terror attacks at the cia and military with the fbi
[24:22.040 --> 24:25.960]  will illegally domestically come after all of us that's all official and that's where we are
[24:26.680 --> 24:32.200]  again back to us for you thank you alex we're back here in the info wars world

[25:01.080 --> 25:05.000]  conference today begging congress begging the united states for help but but the media here
[25:05.000 --> 25:10.600]  tells us that russia's losing ukraine is winning and then ukraine comes zelensky comes and grovels
[25:10.600 --> 25:14.600]  for help but but hey ukraine's winning we can trust the media we're not being lied to about
[25:14.600 --> 25:22.040]  everything over there at all but you know we we have an archivist and you've seen a lot of the
[25:22.040 --> 25:27.560]  great work he does it's really amazing and you see all the videos of alex jones from five years
[25:27.560 --> 25:32.680]  ago ten years ago a month ago five months ago whatever just accurately foreseeing everything

[25:44.440 --> 25:50.360]  memory but it's pretty solid i know i've covered the cia's involvement in ukraine training the
[25:50.360 --> 25:57.640]  proxy groups i'm sure alex has covered it probably years ago so i don't know if the
[25:57.640 --> 26:02.840]  archivist plans on releasing any of that information it's just or those archives it's just funny to
[26:02.840 --> 26:14.440]  sit here and it's like oh yahoo news exclusive cia training proxy groups in ukraine no kidding

[26:23.880 --> 26:34.760]  beef and it just gets ignored by the western press because they are the cia but again just
[26:34.760 --> 26:40.920]  to get back to my point and and when we come back we'll cover the latest news it shouldn't be a
[26:40.920 --> 26:47.080]  controversial opinion to say because we've been lied to about everything in ukraine we should
[26:47.080 --> 26:54.680]  have no involvement and that's how the american people should feel but that's more of a kind of a
[26:54.680 --> 27:02.840]  callous remove yourself from the situation take on it which i have no problem with
[27:05.080 --> 27:13.400]  but now every time i tune in to a press conference and and and the republicans have had like five

[27:44.280 --> 27:48.120]  not he's an he's a comedian i mean can you imagine steven colbert running the country

[33:54.200 --> 33:58.280]  speech to congress begging for help does that sound like a country that's winning the war
[34:04.760 --> 34:10.280]  you know i i even wonder as the crew puts that the story up about the cia proxy groups being
[34:10.280 --> 34:16.280]  trained in ukraine to fight russia i mean we we even probably have news headlines on that
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.800]  and video headlines on that from weeks ago but i'll digress off the point
[34:19.800 --> 34:28.280]  every american that can think what at all should realize how much we're being lied to just from
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.000]  the last 48 hours russia's winning or excuse me Freudian slip russia's losing but here's
[34:35.000 --> 34:42.440]  ukraine zelinski begging for help as if it's our duty to get involved in ukraine
[34:43.880 --> 34:49.320]  what do you hear about ukraine from our politicians and our media freedom it's all about their
[34:49.320 --> 34:56.440]  freedom they have the rights to have a border and not be invaded and freedom and what's their stance
[34:56.440 --> 35:04.280]  on policy here we don't get borders we don't get freedom that's for ukraine you see
[35:06.680 --> 35:13.240]  not that i was for it but they had to fight tooth and nail in congress just to send out
[35:13.240 --> 35:24.360]  600 dollar stimulus checks to americans 600 bucks for an american they're they're in the process i
[35:24.360 --> 35:29.640]  mean when it's all said and done it's going to be about 15 billion dollars sent to ukraine this year
[35:29.640 --> 35:36.120]  alone where do you think that money's going but let's stop right there and cover these headlines
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.840]  and we'll get back to that question zelinski calls out biden and us during address to congress
[35:42.840 --> 35:48.360]  being the leader of the world means to be the leader of peace biden the leader of the world
[35:50.200 --> 35:54.360]  biden who doesn't even know who he is he for he doesn't even know who he is anymore
[35:55.000 --> 36:01.640]  he says uh jill biden's husband tested positive for covid and then the media laughs he's like oh
[36:02.440 --> 36:10.120]  oh that's me oh he just figured that one out he's joe biden he just figured it out
[36:10.120 --> 36:15.080]  he wakes up every day in the white in the white house and says where the hell am i
[36:16.280 --> 36:23.720]  that's just a direct quote from him if you trust him at his word but oh russia's losing the war
[36:23.720 --> 36:29.400]  but ukraine's begging us for help that makes sense zelinski wants a no fly zone so he wants
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.000]  war with russia he just wants everyone else to fight it now as he uh pretends to be a military man
[36:35.000 --> 36:43.720]  says that the u.s. and congress needs to do more invokes martin luther king invokes 9 11
[36:43.720 --> 36:48.360]  hey man we got our own problems okay we've done enough for you and ukraine we've done enough for
[36:48.360 --> 36:54.040]  nato if you can't figure out how to help yourself and help yourselves with all the help we've done
[36:54.040 --> 37:01.960]  for you which probably didn't help at all but that shouldn't be our problem but let's send more
[37:01.960 --> 37:09.480]  money over there where do you think that's going large polis cities uh reaching capacity
[37:10.520 --> 37:17.400]  as us excuse me as un says over three million refugees have fled ukraine ukraine's winning
[37:18.440 --> 37:23.960]  ukraine's winning guys three million have fled the country zelinski's begging for help from the
[37:23.960 --> 37:32.520]  us ukraine is winning people don't even think anymore this is the most obvious you're just
[37:32.520 --> 37:38.840]  being lied to you're being deceived you're being manipulated and and who has been the voice and
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.000]  the wilderness being honest about all this well it's been info wars and it's been a few others out
[37:43.000 --> 37:51.320]  there all i do is tell it like it is and it's been pretty obvious when they keep saying ukraine
[37:51.320 --> 37:58.200]  is winning that they're not winning at all but they just keep saying russia losing ukraine
[37:58.200 --> 38:04.280]  winning and then it's oh millions of fled ukraine oh ukraine begging us for help but they're winning
[38:04.280 --> 38:14.520]  though they are winning they need more of your money because they're winning here's a take from
[38:14.520 --> 38:22.520]  padro gonzalez journalist americans need to know that zelinski's acting in bad faith over about
[38:22.520 --> 38:28.040]  two days he said ukraine must accept that it won't join nato and that a us led nato must
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.520]  establish a no fly zone over ukraine zelinski doesn't want peace negotiations he wants america's
[38:32.520 --> 38:38.280]  blood and treasure why wouldn't zelinski come out months ago saying they won't join nato
[38:38.280 --> 38:45.560]  why wouldn't zelinski have come out in a either joint statement with putin or in his own statement
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.880]  saying hey we want to denotify and we want to demilitarize ukraine as well do you know why
[38:51.880 --> 38:58.200]  folks see it all goes back to the important clip of joe biden in fact we should probably put this
[38:58.200 --> 39:03.720]  up guys look in fact let's do that it'll be clip to be let's get the old joe biden clip at the
[39:03.720 --> 39:12.520]  council on foreign relations because this is very this is very key today and our audience grows
[39:12.520 --> 39:16.680]  every day and and and there might be people who've never seen this clip but when you understand
[39:16.680 --> 39:22.120]  this clip you understand everything joe biden bragging in front of the council on foreign
[39:22.120 --> 39:35.320]  relations that he basically blackmails and bribes ukraine with foreign aid to do his bidding so
[39:36.440 --> 39:43.400]  why wouldn't zelinski have come out months ago and said in either a joint statement with putin
[39:43.400 --> 39:49.720]  or on his own said we're not going to join nato and and we also want to denotify and demilitarize
[39:49.720 --> 39:56.920]  why wouldn't zelinski do that you go back to biden's statement at the council on foreign relations
[39:58.360 --> 40:08.760]  and you fast forward in time to today the answer is obvious folks money money money money money
[40:08.760 --> 40:21.640]  oh zelinski you want that billion dollars in humanitarian aid oh you better not get rid of
[40:21.640 --> 40:26.680]  our cia proxy groups you better not get away you better not get rid of our biological weapons
[40:26.680 --> 40:32.600]  labs you better not get away of all of you better not get rid of all of nato's forward operating bases
[40:32.600 --> 40:39.880]  because if you do we're not going to send you 14 billion dollars so what does zelinski say
[40:40.680 --> 40:47.480]  i guess outside with the biden's and america and take the 14 billion and put my people at risk
[40:48.040 --> 40:56.040]  and where do you think that money's going by the way who's paying attention to where 14 15 16
[40:56.040 --> 41:03.000]  billion dollars of our taxpayer dollars who's who's monitoring that as it goes into ukraine
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.640]  one of the most corrupt countries on earth where do you think that money's going and why do i have
[41:07.640 --> 41:11.880]  a sneaking suspicion some of that's going to end up right into a biden bank account
[41:13.960 --> 41:20.200]  guys do we have that clip though by the way let's let's let's go back in time you want to know why
[41:20.200 --> 41:25.480]  zelinski couldn't make a peace deal with russia you want to know why zelinski has been so bad for
[41:25.480 --> 41:32.120]  ukraine let's wind back the clock and listen to joe biden i believe this was the year 2014 or 15
[41:32.120 --> 41:39.560]  bragging about how he bribes and blackmails ukraine with us foreign aid to their country
[41:40.840 --> 41:47.080]  i remember going over convincing our team or others to convincing us that we should be providing
[41:47.080 --> 41:55.320]  for loan guarantees and i went over i guess the 12 13th time to kiv and uh and i was going supposed
[41:55.320 --> 42:01.240]  to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee and i had gotten a commitment from
[42:01.240 --> 42:07.720]  poroshenko and from uh yatsenyuk that they would take action against a state prosecutor and they
[42:07.720 --> 42:11.880]  didn't so they said they had it they were walking out to press conference and i said i'm not going
[42:11.880 --> 42:16.840]  to or we're not going to give you the billion dollars they said you have no authority you're
[42:16.840 --> 42:21.880]  not the president the president said i said call him i said i'm telling you you're not getting
[42:21.880 --> 42:25.880]  the billion dollars i said you're not getting the billion i'm going to be leaving here and i think
[42:25.880 --> 42:30.840]  it was what six hours i look i said i'm leaving six hours if the prosecutor's not fired you're not
[42:30.840 --> 42:38.440]  getting the money oh son of a bitch got fired and they put in place someone who was solid
[42:38.440 --> 42:44.040]  but yeah who would cover up biden's criminal activities and so now it's the same thing folks
[42:44.040 --> 42:49.800]  except it's it's bigger money and it's bigger conflicts and it's and it's a geopolitical
[42:49.800 --> 42:56.360]  matter not just little petty corruption between american politicians in ukraine it's potentially
[42:56.360 --> 43:04.120]  world war three alex jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great and full
[43:04.120 --> 43:10.760]  worth listeners and viewers if you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.160]  that boosts your immune system and help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level

[43:27.880 --> 43:33.400]  then your purchase of x3 funds our operation now a lot of our products have been sold out and never
[43:33.400 --> 43:39.000]  came back in because the lockdowns and supply chain breakouts we were sold out of x3 for a long time
[43:39.000 --> 43:43.320]  and i had it on sale for 50 off a lot of folks were getting it and i was thinking you know what
[43:43.320 --> 43:48.120]  i'm going to bring it back on sale again just until it sells out because even though we won't make
[43:48.120 --> 43:52.360]  as much money in the long run a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from
[43:52.360 --> 43:58.040]  the sales in now to stay on air see your x3 right now at 50 off and in fullwarstore.com
[43:58.040 --> 44:08.280]  the covid-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience a symbol of slavery a symbol of the change
[44:09.000 --> 44:13.960]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put in place
[44:14.600 --> 44:21.240]  it is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge it is the symbol that
[44:21.240 --> 44:28.040]  we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal faces from the light of the sun
[44:28.600 --> 44:35.480]  it is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil
[44:36.200 --> 44:43.400]  ladies and gentlemen we are crossing the rubicon now the entire future destiny of humanity is upon
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.720]  us claus schwaab and the you and admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part
[44:47.720 --> 44:53.560]  of the world id and carbon taxes things only get worse from here if we submit they only get better
[44:53.560 --> 45:03.960]  if we resist and say no non-compliance non-compliance non-compliance if you only knew the power of
[45:03.960 --> 45:16.200]  the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat humanity then our god will reward us
[45:16.200 --> 45:25.080]  with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the globalists they must first play god they
[45:25.080 --> 45:32.120]  must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system and in a way
[45:32.120 --> 45:37.720]  they're right if we let them lie to us and dump us down and poison us and destroy our children's
[45:37.720 --> 45:43.160]  futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really deserve what's happened to us
[45:43.160 --> 45:51.080]  so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the new order even more i know i'm
[45:51.080 --> 45:57.560]  pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines of the fight is info wars.com
[45:58.120 --> 46:05.400]  it has been noted by many a historian the first casualty of war is the truth then the next big
[46:05.400 --> 46:12.920]  casualty isn't even the people that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crack
[46:12.920 --> 46:21.240]  down on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from
[46:21.240 --> 46:30.760]  the united states to europe legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro russian
[46:30.760 --> 46:37.560]  information you can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now
[46:37.560 --> 46:43.720]  Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the
[46:43.720 --> 46:50.280]  intent to engage in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen
[46:50.280 --> 46:55.480]  the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that
[46:55.480 --> 47:03.800]  makes info wars.com more important than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[47:03.800 --> 47:10.280]  world order it's alex jones
[47:15.400 --> 47:21.640]  i remember going over convincing our team or others to convincing us that we should be providing
[47:21.640 --> 47:29.880]  for loan guarantees and i went over i guess the 12 13th time to kiv and uh and i was going supposed
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.800]  to announce that there was another billion dollar loan guarantee and i had gotten a commitment from
[47:35.800 --> 47:41.960]  poroshenko and from uh yachts and yoke that they would take action against the state prosecutor
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.120]  and they didn't so they said they had they were walking out to press conference and i said i'm
[47:46.120 --> 47:51.240]  not going to or we're not going to give you the billion dollars they said you have no authority
[47:51.240 --> 47:56.360]  you're not the president the president said i said call him i said i'm telling you're not getting
[47:56.360 --> 48:00.520]  the billion dollars i said you're not getting the billion i'm gonna be leaving here and i think it
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.320]  was what six hours i looked i said leave in six hours if the prosecutor's not fired you're not
[48:05.320 --> 48:15.000]  getting the money oh son of a bitch got fired and they put in place someone who was solid that's
[48:15.000 --> 48:21.560]  gangster mafia level behavior right there from jill biden but i guess he runs his own
[48:21.560 --> 48:29.240]  own criminal empire the biden crime family just a little context for those that are unaware
[48:30.040 --> 48:35.240]  there was a prosecutor in ukraine that was investigating the biden's business dealings
[48:35.240 --> 48:40.040]  in ukraine like hunter biden making millions of dollars at a gas company with no experience
[48:40.040 --> 48:48.040]  sitting on a board of directors and all the other deals that biden was making with his
[48:48.040 --> 48:52.680]  business partner like tony babelinsky who who went public with all of it media ignored it
[48:53.960 --> 49:00.040]  no that's gangster level mafia behavior from joe biden saying i as the vice president am not
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.840]  going to release foreign aid to your country unless you fire a prosecutor who's investigating my
[49:04.840 --> 49:12.760]  crimes i mean the godfather is a great movie right that's real life right there i mean i mean that's
[49:12.760 --> 49:23.000]  that is real life mafia don joe biden right there now why do i play this clip again because it's so
[49:23.000 --> 49:29.720]  important if you understand that you understand what's going on in ukraine and you understand why
[49:29.720 --> 49:35.240]  russia is sick of it and you understand why zalinsky has been such an incompetent feckless leader
[49:35.240 --> 49:43.080]  in the last three weeks and you understand why we are now sending tens of billions of dollars to
[49:43.080 --> 49:51.080]  ukraine ukraine is now playing ball with the west they're in control of him he probably wishes
[49:51.080 --> 50:02.360]  putin could save his ass like he saved uh uh uvanovic or the last ukrainian president during the
[50:02.360 --> 50:14.200]  coup in 2014 the bitans the clintons the bushes you name it all these corrupt political empires all
[50:14.200 --> 50:21.000]  these criminal political empires in the west have been dirty dealing in ukraine for years including
[50:21.000 --> 50:27.960]  pelosi and putin knows that and the funny thing is putin would probably let these people steal
[50:27.960 --> 50:35.080]  their loot he just wants the gun off russia's head he just wants the the the proverbial gun to the
[50:35.080 --> 50:42.600]  forehead of russia off out done which is ukraine with the nato bases and the western biological
[50:42.600 --> 50:48.760]  weapons labs and the media won't tell you any of this and now zalinsky is caught up in this web
[50:48.760 --> 50:58.760]  and and who knows what's even going on really but you know it is funny if you go look i mean
[50:58.760 --> 51:05.880]  i look i'm not trying to be like the left here that's so deranged in their in their mental disorder
[51:07.080 --> 51:14.040]  we call liberalism where sarah silverman sees spray paint on a sidewalk that just indicates
[51:14.040 --> 51:19.480]  that there's an electrical line underneath it because they're about to do some digging or some
[51:19.480 --> 51:25.160]  construction and she says oh look a nazi swastka so i'm not i'm not trying to go full deranged
[51:25.160 --> 51:33.160]  mental leftist here but i mean is zalinsky not wearing a nazi iron cross on his t-shirt when
[51:33.160 --> 51:39.400]  he delivered his speech to congress i mean you tell me i mean you look at the cross you look at
[51:39.400 --> 51:47.240]  the nazi cross on the uniform i mean it's kind of the same thing but hey i'm not the one that
[51:47.240 --> 51:51.480]  freaks out over all this nazi symbology like there's a nazi around every corner like the left
[51:51.480 --> 52:00.200]  does i'm just saying uh did you guys notice that did you notice the nazi iron cross he was wearing
[52:00.200 --> 52:10.280]  or or is that a joke and and i guess you don't care about the only neo-nazi faction that's left
[52:10.280 --> 52:18.200]  didn't get hired by the u.s. government in the nasa program or what else i guess that the neo-nazis
[52:18.200 --> 52:25.880]  in ukraine don't exist and i guess that's not a nazi iron cross that zalinsky is wearing
[52:25.880 --> 52:32.360]  folks it's pretty clear that zalinsky cut a deal and it was probably his biggest mistake ever
[52:33.000 --> 52:36.920]  he cut a deal with the west he's cutting deals with the corrupt political empires of america
[52:37.480 --> 52:42.520]  and uh the ukrainian people are suffering because of it that's what's going on and it's
[52:42.520 --> 52:48.920]  disgusting that the american media is propping all of this up as a good thing once again running cover
[52:49.800 --> 52:54.760]  for the biden crime family so that's why i play that clip of the foreign relations
[52:54.760 --> 53:03.720]  is if you can understand that you can understand everything so so let me continue with this news
[53:03.720 --> 53:10.120]  here african reporter calls out white houses strategy in ukraine you guys are pushing these
[53:10.120 --> 53:17.080]  guys to commit suicide that's it bingo that's what zalinsky is doing that's what the west is
[53:17.080 --> 53:28.600]  doing and ladies and gentlemen it is despicable it is diabolical it is disgusting russia's losing
[53:28.600 --> 53:35.240]  russia's losing russia's losing tune in to vladimir zalinsky's press conference begging the us for help
[53:35.240 --> 53:48.360]  and by the way i had people sending me clips last night of old war room broadcasts saying hey look
[53:48.360 --> 53:56.200]  you were right it it has been ukraine bombing ukrainian civilians and then it got confirmed
[53:56.200 --> 54:01.000]  in other news reports like how they shot that journalist that they lied about and then we
[54:01.000 --> 54:08.840]  had the guest on yesterday on the war room from ukraine and again this is sick like i i i really
[54:09.400 --> 54:15.160]  don't like this part of my thinking process and ideology but it's like if i'm gonna shoot 99
[54:15.160 --> 54:19.880]  percent with it i'm gonna take the shot if you just take everything the american media tells you
[54:19.880 --> 54:24.840]  and assume it's a lie and and find truth in the in the opposite of it you're actually more informed
[54:24.840 --> 54:31.480]  than most people so yeah oh russia's bombing ukrainian civilians turns out it was ukraine but
[54:31.480 --> 54:36.280]  what do you expect they're handing out weapons and heavy artillery to citizens on the street
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.840]  many of them gangsters and then they go up they go end up going up shooting up apartment buildings
[54:40.840 --> 54:46.040]  holding poor ukrainians hostage stealing their money it's like oh you gave guns to criminals no
[54:46.040 --> 54:59.880]  kidding but guys it's a yahoo news exclusive that the cia has been training troops in ukraine
[54:59.880 --> 55:05.880]  to fight russia it's a yahoo news exclusive nobody had any idea that's been going on forever
[55:06.520 --> 55:10.680]  nobody's ever been reporting on that for the entire time this conflict broke out
[55:10.680 --> 55:18.680]  out oh just right here at info wars next month's news today it's not even a secret that's the thing
[55:19.800 --> 55:27.640]  they say oh secret oh exclusive are you kidding me secret exclusive anybody with two hands and
[55:27.640 --> 55:33.000]  access to a book or the internet or a library that can read could have figured that deal out
[55:33.000 --> 55:40.200]  but see it all comes back to joe biden at the council on foreign relations
[55:42.040 --> 55:45.800]  the biden crime family it's biden again i mean it's literally biden again
[55:49.400 --> 55:55.080]  biden is i mean it's not joe biden but essentially joe biden has the linsky by the short hairs
[55:55.080 --> 56:03.560]  and it's very simple just like at the council on foreign relations he says do you want 15
[56:03.560 --> 56:08.680]  billion dollars in foreign aid and zelinski says i do and biden says then you're gonna jump when i
[56:08.680 --> 56:16.440]  say jump you're gonna bark when i say bark and you're gonna sit when i say sit and zelinski says
[56:16.440 --> 56:22.680]  yes sir and then they get 15 billion dollars and where do you think that money's gonna go
[56:22.680 --> 56:27.000]  somehow i feel that money's gonna end up into the biden crime family coffers
[56:28.200 --> 56:33.080]  where is 15 billion dollars going to ukraine and this just shows you how corrupt the u.s
[56:33.080 --> 56:37.320]  government is again they have to scratch and claw with something i don't agree with but
[56:37.320 --> 56:41.640]  they have to scratch and claw to give the u.s people 600 dollars in a stimulus check when
[56:41.640 --> 56:46.280]  they shut down the economy for a year oh that's how much you know yeah 600 bucks will help
[56:46.280 --> 56:55.720]  help again i don't support that form of communism but 600 bucks for the american people they scratch
[56:55.720 --> 57:05.320]  and claw 15 billion dollars for ukraine pass it overnight baby because they have stock in
[57:05.320 --> 57:09.960]  weapon manufacturers and defense contractors that they're making huge amounts of money on
[57:09.960 --> 57:18.120]  and they know how to wash that money and launder that money that goes into ukraine and find ways
[57:18.120 --> 57:25.000]  to put it right back into their pocketbooks it's all a big giant boondoggle folks it's more
[57:25.000 --> 57:32.920]  corrupt american politicians running a money laundering insider trading boondoggle as innocent
[57:32.920 --> 57:40.120]  people in in ukraine and civilians get slaughtered and seriously where is the american left that has
[57:40.120 --> 57:44.760]  been against innocent people being slaughtered because of the financial interest of western

[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:46.120]  just incredible stuff we'll give out that phone number number on the other side here is a list
[1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:52.200]  of names though here's a list of names since since we haven't just read the list off i'll read it to
[1:00:52.200 --> 1:01:00.600]  you now this is the list of names that have been sanctioned by vladimir putin joe biden
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:12.760]  anthony blinkin loy dawson mark milley jacob sullivan william burns jen sake dalip sing
[1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:24.120]  samantha power hunter biden hillary clinton autowale adi emo reta joe louis some of those
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:30.920]  names you recognize some you may not it's pretty much and it's it's the main players in biden's
[1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:43.000]  cabinet and then just throwing in some of the corrupt people like hunter biden and hillary clinton so
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:52.200]  i'm not sure if this is just putin trolling with these sanctions having a good laugh or if
[1:01:54.360 --> 1:01:59.160]  he's he's trying to send a serious message with this i don't really know putin seems to be pretty
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:05.000]  unpredictable to me at this point the west and our politicians are extremely predictable their
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:10.760]  bloodthirsty money laundering criminals it's easy to predict their activities they run the same
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:15.480]  playbook over and over again i'm not really sure what putin is thinking at this point in time
[1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:21.000]  is he trolling america with these sanctions or is this a serious thing
[1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:25.800]  but there's the list of names what do you think about those names by the way
[1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:30.680]  i think there's any criminals think there's any treasonous actors on that list
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:36.920]  ukrainian border guard detains two chinese nationals accused of smuggling babies oh
[1:02:37.880 --> 1:02:42.920]  some nice child sex trafficking human trafficking going on there at the border of ukraine with
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:51.240]  chinese nationals huh wonder if biden knows anything about that remember his old friend the old mayor
[1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:58.200]  of moscow that was involved in human trafficking that he made million dollar deals with biden sending
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:05.800]  thousands of marines to australia in anticipation of conflict with china so how what what look i'm
[1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:11.720]  glad that we haven't gotten further involved in ukraine as far as boots on the ground or our
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:18.120]  military involvement there's obviously a reason for this and my guess is strategically
[1:03:18.120 --> 1:03:28.360]  if they if they have made any decisions about sending us troops to a conflict in a different
[1:03:28.920 --> 1:03:32.760]  country they've decided that it's going to be our best interest to do that in taiwan
[1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:42.200]  i'm not saying that's going to happen they might not do that too but i am glad that our
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:48.440]  troops are not on the ground in ukraine and i hope they won't be on the ground in taiwan but
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:54.840]  it is sad that this is happening and it's going to hurt the west and it's it's sad for the civilians
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:01.240]  that live in those countries but we can't even figure our own stuff out we're supposed to go now
[1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:07.480]  take care of stuff in taiwan and ukraine when you go downtown chicago downtown new york downtown
[1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:14.440]  st louis downtown san francisco downtown baltimore and it's just total degradation violent crimes i
[1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:20.360]  mean folks new york city already has an uptick in almost 50 percent an uptick in crime from last
[1:04:20.360 --> 1:04:24.680]  year which was a record-setting year in crime in new york city it's already up 50 percent we're not

[1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:32.440]  we took the threat of putin invading very seriously we acted on it we sent ukraine more security
[1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:38.520]  systems last year 650 million dollars in weapons including anti-air and anti-armor equipment
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:45.400]  before the invasion more than we had ever provided before now that was an invasion began they already
[1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:49.960]  had in their hands the kinds of weapons they needed to counter russian advances and once the
[1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:56.120]  war started we immediately rushed 350 million in additional aid to further address their needs
[1:06:56.120 --> 1:07:01.240]  and how'd that work out hundreds of anti-air systems thousands of anti-tank weapons transport
[1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:07.400]  helicopters arm patrol boats and other high mobility vehicles radar so so guys just pull

[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:37.640]  stutter nothing biden goes and in 15 minutes launder billions of dollars through ukraine
[1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:45.960]  and he does it in broad daylight right on camera with the whole media there
[1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:50.200]  and then someone tries to ask a question he says no questions and they say yes sir
[1:13:52.120 --> 1:14:01.480]  wow holy smokes all right let's take your response to all of this on the phone lines
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:06.360]  eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:12.920]  two five three nine and guys let's only do calls on this situation in ukraine with zealinsky's press
[1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:19.080]  conference biden's press conference my commentary i don't want calls on anything else so if somebody
[1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.440]  calls in and wants to talk about something else we're just not going to take that call right now
[1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:26.680]  i want to stay focused on this subject material maybe later when i get into some of this other
[1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:31.960]  news like the vaccine killing people uh democrats getting caught with crimes the war going on at
[1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:36.600]  the southern border that nobody's talking about except i guess info wars uh told you about that
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:43.560]  yesterday it's now getting worse um but we'll do that later i i want to take calls on your response
[1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:47.960]  to the zealinsky press conference the biden press conference my commentary and just the ongoing
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:53.720]  situation in ukraine i mean is this not so obvious is this not the most obvious thing ever
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:15:03.880]  he's biden and our criminal politicians are double dipping and doubling down their investments on the
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:09.160]  war in ukraine while pretending like they want to help ukraine when they're only helping themselves
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:14.520]  because they get to blame putin for everything they're doing with the ongoing conflict in ukraine
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:18.760]  and they get to continue to launder weapons and money through ukraine something they've
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:25.400]  been doing for decades which is why they want to protect it at all costs and and they just do it in
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:29.720]  broad daylight man i mean they they only need to work for 15 minutes a day and they just i mean
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:35.640]  you remember like the wolf of wall street when they would do like 25 million dollar deals and
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:40.520]  50 million dollar deals and they'd go into the office and they jump up and down and pop champagne
[1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:47.000]  and they'd be like 50 million dollars and 10 hours biden just laundered billions of dollars
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:53.320]  in 10 minutes so suck on that wolf of wall street joe biden the wolf of washington dc
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:05.880]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march 2022 and in the month of february we had a very
[1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:13.640]  popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:20.360]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system your
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:26.600]  stamina your libido so much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:31.640]  this is the very best iodine out there so we had on sale 50 percent off but we sold more than half
[1:16:31.640 --> 1:16:36.840]  of what we have or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to full products and
[1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:41.160]  i was just thinking you know what we need to funds in now to stay on air plus this is the
[1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:46.120]  right product everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get

[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:24.120]  hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:30.280]  seeds natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:35.640]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown
[1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:39.800]  as for vitamin c and zinc themselves you probably already know that they play an
[1:18:39.800 --> 1:18:44.680]  important role in nutrition immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health
[1:18:44.680 --> 1:18:49.960]  it has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.920]  like here in america so next time you visit be sure to check it out at info wars store.com
[1:18:54.920 --> 1:19:02.280]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie the globalist social engineers always intended to push
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:10.120]  their coveted biomedical tyranny lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that
[1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:16.360]  as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out
[1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:21.240]  against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others
[1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:27.560]  coming public and and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling apart because the people
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:34.680]  are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:39.560]  now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on
[1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:45.240]  their takeover like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency and martial law in
[1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:50.920]  ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like australia so pray for these folks big
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:56.120]  time this is a very serious situation and stay tuned into info wars dot com because truth is
[1:19:56.120 --> 1:20:16.680]  absolutely paramount leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:22.840]  i guess our problem here at info wars and this audience and myself personally is that we just
[1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:29.960]  care too much we just actually genuinely care and i guess that's our biggest flaw isn't it
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:35.000]  because i mean this stuff is just hilarious and ridiculous i mean joe biden the guy who
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:39.560]  craps himself when he's at the vatican and by the way he was supposed to be traveling to europe
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:43.640]  for a trip i'm pretty sure they're going to cancel that you can you can you can guess why
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:50.760]  joe biden who yesterday talks about how he has coveted but he calls himself jill biden's
[1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:53.320]  husband and he doesn't even know where he is or who he is
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:01.400]  it's just it's just i mean really it's just so ridiculous it's hilarious but but we understand
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:06.440]  how this is gonna hurt the entire world in this country in the future so we kind of take it personally
[1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:12.040]  and we don't like it but man oh man i mean if i didn't care this is hilarious stuff
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:18.760]  you could just do coverage of this and just be like wow isn't this funny
[1:21:18.760 --> 1:21:23.880]  wow look at how dumb the american people are wow look at how big a liars and scum the american
[1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:34.600]  politicians are i mean that's what i'm saying like it it's joe biden and the calc run for relations
[1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:39.320]  bragging about how he uses bribery and blackmail i mean this is a joke
[1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:46.040]  biden apparently has coveted right now they say oh biden's got coveted he's out there no mask
[1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:50.200]  walking around good fine i'm not the one that lives in fear of covet i'm not the one that
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:55.400]  cares about covet it's him begging you to wear a mask and take a vaccine but apparently he has
[1:21:55.400 --> 1:22:02.280]  coveted he's wandering around the white house just sending we're just sending billions of
[1:22:02.280 --> 1:22:09.000]  dollars to ukraine sending all these weapons to ukraine is anybody monitoring this is anybody
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:12.600]  going to be monitoring the money is anybody going to be monitoring where the weapons go
[1:22:12.600 --> 1:22:20.680]  it's not like the us is known to armed terrorist and proxy groups in that region oh no it's not
[1:22:20.680 --> 1:22:26.760]  like the biden's are no for bribery and blackmail and and and running their own scams in ukraine no

[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:51.320]  you're on the alex jones show go ahead hi oan howdy one thing that people are not asking about this
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:59.160]  whole situation is we could be going to war with a nuclear russia where's our civil defense system
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:04.040]  where's our fallout shelters where's the supplies where's the we don't have anything oh yeah nothing
[1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:08.120]  on that they just tell you to wear a mask literally they tell you if you get hit with a nuke wear a
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:14.520]  mask russia has a major civil defense system so does china i'm pretty sure it does we don't have
[1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:19.800]  anything because they don't care they don't care about us if we die by the millions they just don't
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:24.920]  care they don't give a raster in all they're doing on their bull side republicans the democrats are
[1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:30.520]  cheering hey we're going to war with russia no i would even say i'm confident that if something
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:35.320]  happened and millions americans died that biden and polosi and and probably romney and grand would
[1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:42.120]  actually probably be happy and celebrate it behind closed doors i think so too and the people that
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:46.920]  should be a big rallying cry if we make it to the mid-term elections is hey they don't care where's
[1:25:46.920 --> 1:25:51.720]  our if we're gonna go to war why don't they care about us they give us fallout shelters and all
[1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:56.680]  this stuff we don't have nothing come on john they told you if you get nuked wear a mask
[1:25:58.520 --> 1:26:02.040]  and been down kishirin goodbye because that's what the only thing we got i guess
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:10.680]  oh my gosh and and by the way if if china does go into taiwan how much money do you think we'll
[1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:15.560]  be sending over there too well even if they don't hit us with nukes
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:22.200]  we'll they'll drive the gas price the gas up to ten dollars a gallon the economy start crumbling
[1:26:22.200 --> 1:26:27.240]  but they don't care and they'll blame pootin that's right he's the fall guy right now
[1:26:27.240 --> 1:26:33.080]  it's just despicable stuff our government hates us
[1:26:34.840 --> 1:26:38.760]  that they do i think so i saw our mother the other day we don't have a government
[1:26:40.680 --> 1:26:45.640]  yeah we've got like a like a a kidnapper or like a we're like held hostage by our government
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:51.320]  we're in an abusive relationship with our government our government just abuses us
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:56.280]  shakes us down whenever it wants beats us up whenever it wants silences us whenever it wants
[1:26:56.280 --> 1:27:02.520]  uh forces us to fight for their corruption whenever it wants i'm done with it man i'm done with it
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:10.360]  anything else john no that's it well i thank you for the call let's go to steven calling in from
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:15.720]  florida steven you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey good afternoon on all right so
[1:27:16.520 --> 1:27:21.720]  with this situation in ukraine i want to give a little bit uh different spin on this and this
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:27.000]  is from a biblical standpoint now first of all anybody that wants to get a good education on
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:33.720]  history you need to watch alex jones terror storm he really goes into detail about false flags
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:41.160]  and you'll really start seeing the pick the pieces of the puzzle falling into place with that now
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:48.600]  okay so if you go back to what we've done okay we took out uh mozadak you know the cia helped do
[1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:57.080]  that and i and uh i ran back in the fifties okay then of course you had the arab spring muslim
[1:27:57.080 --> 1:28:03.880]  brotherhood you know he had mubarak in egypt uh and then of course saddam in iraq and uh we went
[1:28:03.880 --> 1:28:09.880]  into afghanistan and uh of course we wanted to go into syria you know and go after a side
[1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:15.080]  and faking the gas attack when it was the isis that did that which by the way we propped up
[1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:21.160]  up and so you know you've got these different dictators that you know the globalist uh you
[1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:26.920]  know fund and they prop up and then they the dictators ego gets in the way just like hitler
[1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:33.560]  and stalin and they just died to stiff the globalist and so ultimately they get taken out well
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:40.440]  here's the thing uh alex is right i believe putin has walked into a trap this you could call ukraine
[1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:46.360]  the bear trap with you know uh russia being the bear okay so here's what i believe is going to occur
[1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:52.600]  in azekiel 38 and 39 it talks about gog and maygog and these are ancient terms for what's now
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:29:01.000]  russia and the confederacy we got to go to a break here alex jones here with a very simple

[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:58.920]  decrease in the deficit really really you're decreasing the deficit as you're sending billions
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:05.880]  to ukraine anybody that believes that is a idiot as the clock the debt trillionaire clock just
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:15.080]  just constantly goes up yeah it decreased it my butt anything else got uh you know i just wanted
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:19.960]  to give in my uh three months i usually call in just spread the word about grand theft world
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:25.800]  it's just doing amazing stuff they do air your stuff quite a bit and they're doing an amazing
[1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:31.080]  job over there so we got to get the word out about how many podcasts and everything that's
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.320]  going on uh there's a lot of amazing shows going on so i just wanted to get my message out about
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:42.680]  grand theft world dot com grand theft world dot com all right they share our stuff we appreciate that
[1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:48.520]  yeah there are all kinds of podcasts and and talk radio shows and everything it's all popping up in
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:55.240]  in a populist or right wing fashion there's no leftist taking off in the media world folks there's
[1:35:55.240 --> 1:36:00.040]  no leftist podcast that people even listen to there's no there's no liberal commentator or
[1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:06.040]  intellectual or ideologue that has any following because they're not intellectual and their ideas
[1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:13.800]  are failed i mean they would give they've given millions of dollars to the obama for podcasts
[1:36:13.800 --> 1:36:21.000]  obamas nobody listens uh hillary clinton podcast nobody listens i think that nobody would even
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:27.400]  be listening to the hacks like colbert or kimmel if they weren't on cable news and force fed to you
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:35.400]  on the big tech platforms there is no populist movement anywhere near uh the left wing ideology
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:45.000]  or the liberal progressive movement in america it's just hollywood soulless fops and the brainwashed
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:52.360]  minions that uh i guess just their soul is just gone at this point let's go to jay in tennessee
[1:36:52.360 --> 1:37:01.880]  you're on the alex joneshow jay go ahead hey elwin what's up man howdy man i'm just frustrated about
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:10.280]  this ukrainian situation should have been avoidable i mean people don't understand their history on the
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:18.280]  situation like with nato forming after world war two you know russia was our ally and they lost millions
[1:37:18.280 --> 1:37:27.640]  of people but then they created the war saw pack and then that created conflict and when in the early
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:34.920]  1990s when the soviet union collapsed that was our opportunity to bring them in you know and spread
[1:37:34.920 --> 1:37:43.080]  freedom but we just screwed it up our foreign policy is just crap man like and i'm just concerned
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:52.200]  about our country going to world war three and i just i don't we're better than i feel like
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:38:00.280]  just a shame yeah and let's just expand on on what you said at the beginning of the call
[1:38:00.280 --> 1:38:05.320]  that that all of this would have been avoidable you're absolutely correct putin has been trying
[1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:11.400]  to speak with the un and nato and and the west and they just have been ignored for years
[1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:21.000]  and so russia felt its only path of of being heard was this invasion of ukraine all america or the
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:27.880]  west or ukraine had to do was get rid of get rid of the biological weapons labs get rid of the nato
[1:38:27.880 --> 1:38:33.800]  defense systems in ukraine get rid of the cia backed nazi groups in ukraine and russia would
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:38.680]  have never gone in but they wouldn't do it they didn't do it and so russia went in that's the
[1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:43.160]  facts of the situation you can decide who's good and who's bad but those are the facts
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:50.280]  don't be fooled anything else jay yeah like we need to focus on our country like our borders
[1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:55.640]  are collapsing our economies in the crap oh you mean our our our collapsing infrastructure our
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:01.800]  our collapsed border our our degrading deteriorating inner cities are our crime waves skyrocketing
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:05.880]  our consumer price index skyrocketing the inflation and the loss of the power of the
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:12.520]  us dollar you mean we should care about that oh yeah and we need to prosecute you know people in
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:20.200]  the past like president bush who tortured people on the guantanamo bay obama um creating this uh
[1:39:21.320 --> 1:39:31.240]  state of uh um information war on us in uh surveillance state i mean the list goes on and
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:38.440]  on but we don't have any courageous leaders anymore it's all about money and power it's just a real
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:46.360]  shame man no it's bad it's uh bad and for all that talk of trump draining the swamp the swamp is
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:54.040]  swampier than ever before right now yeah and i had friends in alabama that voted for biden
[1:39:54.040 --> 1:40:00.360]  and now they're complaining about the gas price is going up it's like i told you so this is a socialism
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:04.840]  and like we need to mind our own business we got too many problems
[1:40:06.040 --> 1:40:12.120]  yeah we got a race war yep and it's all it's all stemming from the american left i'm not
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:16.040]  saying the republican party is the solution to this stuff but but all these problems stem from
[1:40:16.040 --> 1:40:20.600]  the american left thank you for the call jay and i've got more evidence of that but but you're seeing
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:27.480]  a lot of this now let's get into what he talked about with the gas situation so biden is now realizing
[1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:36.040]  what everybody else realized a week ago that the gas prices going up are not in line with the actual
[1:40:36.040 --> 1:40:42.040]  price of oil and so somebody tweets this out from his president's sole account on twitter
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:46.920]  oil prices are decreasing gas prices should too well that's not a lot that's not fully true oil
[1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:51.480]  prices are actually increasing but they did take a little bit of a dip in the last seven days
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:58.280]  last time oil was ninety six dollars a barrel gas was 362 a gallon now it's four dollars thirty
[1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:03.080]  one cents on average oil and gas companies shouldn't have their profits at the expense of hard
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:10.120]  working americans but see here's what he leaves out he's choked out the oil companies when he
[1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:16.600]  shut down the keystone pipeline and we shut down all these other pipelines and drilling projects
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:21.880]  they invested billions of dollars in these projects that they assume they would be able to go forward
[1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:26.440]  with and and now it's costing them billions of dollars they're taking a loss on that so they've
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:31.160]  got to make it up somewhere now look i'm not sitting here standing up for the oil and gas
[1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:34.280]  industry they make plenty of money i don't think they're going to become i don't think they're
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:39.160]  going to be hit too hard by ten dollars a gasoline uh like like most other americans are but that's
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:45.400]  not the point the point is biden's policies have consequences and we live in a free market system
[1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:55.000]  so yeah the price of gas is only going to go up because biden has committed to destroying the
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:42:02.840]  oil industry and biden has shut down our oil production and now half the planet hates us
[1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:09.320]  because of joe biden and they're not helping us out on oil and if this trend continues
[1:42:09.880 --> 1:42:15.640]  we're going to lose all of our strategic oil reserves as we're about to potentially enter
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:22.040]  a larger world conflict how's that strategy going to go well who cares biden's about to
[1:42:22.040 --> 1:42:28.840]  launder billions of dollars in ukraine you think he gives a damn germany's not laughing now russia
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:35.080]  reverses gas flow of key pipelines serving your member when trump addressed the un and he said
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:41.080]  germany you're gonna be hurt uh by this policy in russia and the nato policy in russia and they
[1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:48.280]  all laughed during that oops looks like trump was right again germany's not laughing now but russia's
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:54.600]  losing guys russia is losing as other world powers are aligning with them and and european
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:43:00.040]  nations and american nations are suffering and zelinski's begging for help has been noted by many
[1:43:00.040 --> 1:43:08.280]  a historian the first casualty of war is the truth in the next big casualty isn't even the people
[1:43:08.280 --> 1:43:16.200]  that die know that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic
[1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:22.680]  liberty and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe
[1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:32.440]  are legislations being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro russian information you
[1:43:32.440 --> 1:43:38.520]  can be censored you can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now canada's introduced
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:45.000]  legislation that if you have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:51.720]  in hate speech online that you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism
[1:43:51.720 --> 1:43:56.520]  is being carried out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes them forwards
[1:43:56.520 --> 1:44:03.480]  dot com more important than ever the globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual
[1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:09.160]  warfare and with poisons and chemicals added to the food it's all come out and they're doing that
[1:44:09.160 --> 1:44:15.000]  not because we're weak but because we're made the image of god the creator and we are powerful
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:20.840]  and the social engineers fear that so much so that's why i repeat that famous internet saying that
[1:44:20.840 --> 1:44:28.920]  nobody knows who first came up with the boy is it true the propaganda would not be necessary if the
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:35.080]  situation was hopeless they need all the propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all
[1:44:35.080 --> 1:44:42.040]  their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:46.520]  the god of this world who is a loser and that's why it's so important that everybody keep them
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:51.400]  for originally here now more than ever because even you don't believe in god what the globalists
[1:44:51.400 --> 1:44:56.600]  are manifesting setting up is safe and and we are opposing the one world government and the
[1:44:56.600 --> 1:45:01.560]  mark of the beast they just announced so when i first started taking survival shield basically
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:07.000]  i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:11.720]  on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the
[1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:16.600]  original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came

[1:45:32.200 --> 1:45:36.520]  the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your

[1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:50.680]  we have to get ourselves clean that's a break free of the globalist system and the only way to do
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.800]  that is to take our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for

[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:05.160]  seen the side that's winning the war begging for help and then needing billions of dollars
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:10.680]  and additional funding oh that's right we're just being lied to about that again and so we go back
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:16.520]  to the phone lines now we have ken on the line from illinois ken you are on the alex joneshow go
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:27.720]  ahead good day owen um first time caller never been so freaked out before my life but with this
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:34.840]  solinski thing uh people upset with him wearing a t-shirt well i don't know who would go to war
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:43.000]  wearing a suit and tie so he's an actor so he's wearing a t-shirt looking like he's in battle
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.960]  and everything yeah he's got the beard now too and did you see macron who's now trying to do
[1:48:47.960 --> 1:48:53.000]  the same thing he's growing out this double he's wearing t-shirts and hoodies i mean look i'm not
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:49:00.680]  the fashion police here okay but i mean certain occasions call for certain looks and appearances
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:11.000]  and uh it's it's not that true uh but the other thing the iron cross predates nazis even predates
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:16.920]  germany it's from prussia but that's not the big thing there uh with him begging for money
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:23.160]  george washington couldn't even get money from congress and yet now we're shelling it out over
[1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:30.200]  to a place that has zero interest for us but definitely does for like you said the crime
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:36.200]  syndicate uh the the thing that really freaked me out was a couple years ago i stumbled upon
[1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:44.920]  oliver stone's uh documentary which should have been talked about years ago because it laid out
[1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:51.400]  the whole thing how it wasn't trump it was everyone that was claiming trump was colluding
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:50:01.960]  so yeah i'm shelling money over there is just trying to clear up that whole mess and make sure
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:09.480]  it doesn't come out yeah and who's going to be who's going to be monitoring where the money
[1:50:09.480 --> 1:50:13.800]  goes who's going to be monitoring where the weapons go i mean these are basic questions
[1:50:13.800 --> 1:50:19.240]  that nobody can even answer and we never get an explanation on it's just pathetic that's because
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:25.240]  we're we're living in a false reality this show if a war is the only way you're getting the
[1:50:25.240 --> 1:50:32.120]  the reality and the truth uh so i'm shocked that they didn't have buying coming out anymore
[1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:38.680]  i wouldn't be surprised if it gets to the point where he doesn't even show up because he doesn't
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:46.280]  need to i mean hey he did 10 minutes of a press conference today 10 minutes can 10 whole minutes
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:51.640]  responding to zalinsky begging for help even though he's winning and then uh allocating more
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:58.200]  weaponry and more money to ukraine 10 minutes is what was warranted for that and not a single
[1:50:58.200 --> 1:51:03.800]  question from the press either well i'm shocked that they haven't gotten so arrogant to just
[1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:09.640]  haven't come out for one minute saying hey this is what we're doing uh i'm going back to
[1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:17.720]  doing nothing living my life you cattle can uh complain all you want but guess what
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:27.240]  you got no say it's just it's madness it's nuts it is not sure where we're going to go from here
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:34.520]  well i think it's going to get worse before it gets better sadly and we've been saying that for a
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:40.520]  while but the whole world is waking up to this i mean there's a great reset going on and there's
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:48.360]  a great awakening going on and look i'm not going to sit here and praise president ji zheng ping
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:57.640]  i'm no fan of the chinese communists but ji zheng ping doesn't want chinese men being gay
[1:51:57.640 --> 1:52:02.920]  ji zheng ping doesn't want to feminize chinese men i mean why do you think that is
[1:52:02.920 --> 1:52:11.400]  this so but nobody understands the sad thing because the state of the media nobody truly
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:17.640]  understands the dynamics of what we're dealing with in the the current times because the american
[1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:22.200]  media treats them like like cattle and like children and and they don't want to know either they
[1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:26.920]  like the propaganda they like falling for whatever the latest propaganda is it makes them feel good
[1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:31.400]  you know they wear a mask makes them feel good they put up a ukraine flag it makes them feel good
[1:52:31.400 --> 1:52:36.760]  they don't do anything in their lives that make them feel good so they have to do fake astroturf
[1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:41.880]  virtue signaling to feel good and that's the loss of humanity right there kent thank you so much
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:46.120]  for the call let's go to joseph in new york joseph you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:55.160]  hi uh hi owen thank you uh um long time listener uh first time caller so um it's amazing to see you
[1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:59.720]  grow over the years just amazing how you're how you're just on it all the time and you know i guess
[1:52:59.720 --> 1:53:05.080]  you won the oscar award because now you know you you're um and and and uh because now you're going
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:11.720]  to uh uh face the uh you know the beast you know in washington you know so i i pray for your uh
[1:53:11.720 --> 1:53:16.920]  for justice in your case but anyway i wanted to ask you do you think that this is going to bump up
[1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:28.840]  biden's polls in any way no no which is kind of a reverse trend normally it's historically speaking
[1:53:28.840 --> 1:53:33.720]  least in modern history when u.s presidents get involved in wars or wars go on usually that gives
[1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:38.440]  them a boost in the approval ratings it's kind of a patriotic thing i guess and and you know wanting
[1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:43.160]  to support the u.s at times of war uh it's not working for biden and i'm not sure that's the
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:49.160]  intention but uh no he's not getting any boost at all from this yeah and the other thing i wanted
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.720]  to say is i i think that the ukraine is the second biggest money laundering operation in the world
[1:53:53.720 --> 1:53:59.080]  because i think the u.s is the number one it's like it seems to be at this point the clearing
[1:53:59.080 --> 1:54:04.040]  house of all the corruption throughout the world it's like if you're a kleptocrat come to new york
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:09.400]  and buy your luxury you know um penthouses you know it's just like it just seems like it's
[1:54:09.400 --> 1:54:13.880]  it's so disgusting that's everywhere at this point it's so pervasive i don't know how
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:20.680]  we come out of it without some type of complete collapse and rebuild well that's the agenda that's
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:26.440]  the corrupt western politicians agenda that's the great reset is to collapse everything
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:31.160]  because they know it's inevitable that if the system collapses they'll get blamed
[1:54:31.800 --> 1:54:37.800]  and or their criminal activity will be exposed so they figure just collapse at all the rubble
[1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:43.160]  and then and then skirt all the responsibility and all the blame and make off with their stolen loot
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:50.520]  yeah it seems so i really encourage parallel economies i mean you know i'm on the little i'm
[1:54:50.520 --> 1:54:54.680]  on the fence about crypto you know i'm i'm involved in it but um i think that and the
[1:54:54.680 --> 1:54:59.880]  combination of just communities getting together and look you know there's a place to everything
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:04.200]  and there's a value to everything like how is the skyscraper in manhattan more valuable than
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:09.560]  the springs that are you know underneath your farmland you know that that there's just just a
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:14.440]  there's just such a disparity between price and value and and i feel like some americans
[1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:20.280]  are awakening to that especially as the prices start rising and and unfortunately most it's
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:25.720]  sort of like a Pareto principle you know we got all it takes is 20 oh and that's all it takes maybe
[1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:32.760]  even less than that well and and we're here entrenched in austin texas and believe me folks
[1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:36.680]  there's there's the same instinct that that that you probably have out there that we have here
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:42.680]  here which is get out of major cities get out of democrat run cities uh you know get out of these
[1:55:42.680 --> 1:55:46.520]  liberal cities that are just going to hell in a handbasket but we're entrenched here and there's
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:53.080]  kind of this this feeling of defend austin because there is a big conservative move into texas and
[1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.160]  there's a lot of people in the conservative in the tech and media industry moving to austin
[1:55:57.160 --> 1:56:02.520]  specifically so there's kind of a pushback here but believe me we have the same instincts i mean
[1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:09.240]  i mean you're going to see homesteading become a mainstream feature soon homeschooling uh you
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:15.160]  know having little farms little gardens i mean that's that's the future which is the past but
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:19.640]  but it's the future because all the all the promises we were made about the future with
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:25.880]  technology and expansion of uh humanity and everything we were lied to we that's been stolen
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:30.680]  from us so now we've got to go back to save ourselves yeah and it has to be parallel because
[1:56:30.680 --> 1:56:35.240]  i mean you know you really look at this that that harpy you know avril hains didn't choose
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.640]  you know the head of the director she's the director of the national intelligence and it's
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:45.560]  just like all of this all of this was pre-orchestrated like even while trump was in office they
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:54.360]  set it up so that when they transitioned um the the worldwide um uh harm or threat assessment
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:57:03.000]  was about domestic terrorism and they've telegraphed what they've wanted to do they want to focus on
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:10.120]  people like you and i who don't want to live under globalist tyranny and they want to focus on
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:15.000]  people who are willing to stand against it publicly willing to stand against it as a voice in the
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:19.720]  media i mean that's why they hate me so much folks i mean if you want to get down to it
[1:57:19.720 --> 1:57:24.920]  and joseph thank you for the call they hate me because i confronted jerry nadler they hate me
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.520]  because i confront politicians to their face they hate me because i go to their little
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:33.320]  pedophile events and call them out they hate me because i'm on the air every day calling out their
[1:57:33.320 --> 1:57:41.720]  crimes so yeah but they really just hate all of us they just want to make an example of info wars
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:45.800]  like they did with the censorship they want to make an example of alex jones roger stono and schreuer
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:55.800]  it's hard to believe that we're already into march 2022 and in the month of february we had a very
[1:57:55.800 --> 1:58:03.560]  popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:10.280]  your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system your
[1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:16.520]  stamina your libido so much and the majority of the population of the world is iodine deficient
[1:58:16.520 --> 1:58:21.800]  this is the very best iodine output so we had on sale 50% off but we sold more than half of what
[1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:27.080]  we have or isn't going to come in for a long time so i took it back to full process i was just
[1:58:27.080 --> 1:58:31.720]  thinking you know what we need to funds in now to stay on air plus this is the right product
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:36.840]  everybody needs so to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get x3 and experience
[1:58:36.840 --> 1:58:43.080]  of yourself and support the broadcast i'm going to keep it at 50 off until it sells out get x3

[1:59:53.480 --> 2:00:09.400]  order it's alex jones
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:18.680]  let's quickly take a look at some of the other news here happening
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:26.600]  yeah before we go back to your phone calls congressional republicans file lawsuit against
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:36.520]  cdc to end mask mandate for air travel you can thank rand paul for that it did win in the senate
[2:00:37.320 --> 2:00:42.280]  i believe it won in the senate i'm not sure that it's officially been yet i forget the
[2:00:42.280 --> 2:00:46.200]  exact numbers but there's finally a push from our government to stop this insanity of the masks
[2:00:46.200 --> 2:00:54.920]  on the airplanes including from ted Cruz in fact we've got a clip from ted Cruz on that right now
[2:00:54.920 --> 2:01:05.400]  for you in clip 10 by the way according to the virtue signal if one mask is good two is better
[2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:11.000]  and even better than that is three well you know what if you want to wear three masks
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:17.160]  from now until the end of time you can nobody's stopping you you have every freedom to mask up
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:24.920]  as long as you want but stop using arbitrary government power to force the american people
[2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:34.040]  to play in covet theater now mitt romney was one of the only republicans to vote against
[2:01:34.040 --> 2:01:41.320]  against ending the mask mandate the senate backed rand paul's efforts to scrap mask mandates
[2:01:41.320 --> 2:01:47.080]  on public transport by voting tuesday 57 to 40 in favor of ending the restrictions on planes
[2:01:47.080 --> 2:01:55.800]  and trains the only republican to vote against it was mitt romney what a sad sack he is so
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:01.880]  that's in response to the white house expanding the public transit mask mandate the federal
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:11.000]  mask mandate until april 18th they're never going to stop with the mask insanity and it's just
[2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:15.720]  ridiculous considering you just had this state of the union with all the democrats and nobody
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:21.480]  wearing masks and you have biden who's apparently covet positive walking around the white house not
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:26.680]  wearing a mask and again i don't care i don't care if the whole crew has coveted and comes into work
[2:02:26.680 --> 2:02:30.680]  and i sit in a room with them or go have dinner with them or we work together doesn't bother me
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:38.680]  a bit i don't live in fear i don't care i'm not playing the game anymore i'm over it but biden
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:44.600]  apparently who doesn't even know who he is refers to himself as the husband of jill biden not even
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:49.480]  realizing that that's him apparently he's walking around with covet not wearing a mask and it's no
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:56.680]  big deal okay but though the mask mandate for you still stands it's like obama tests positive for
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:02.360]  covet and says this is i've been vaccinated and i have covet and that shows you that the vaccine
[2:03:02.360 --> 2:03:07.960]  works he says i have covet i mean it's such a joke he goes i have covet and i'm feeling great
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.520]  just a little scratchy throat the vaccine works and it's like oh you mean what about all the people
[2:03:12.520 --> 2:03:17.160]  that tested positive for covet which may have been a false positive tested positive for covet and
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:26.440]  didn't have any symptoms you know and that's why i think you know these professional sports leagues
[2:03:26.440 --> 2:03:34.600]  are obviously dropping a lot of their covet nonsense because they realize how ridiculous it is but
[2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:43.240]  you have a lot of these athletes now like kairi erving and kevin durant who i don't really watch
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:48.760]  much sports anymore let alone the nba like never but i'll cheer for kevin durant i'll cheer for kairi
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:55.080]  erving i'll cheer for brad bill i'll cheer for jonathan isaac for for standing against medical
[2:03:55.080 --> 2:04:01.400]  tyranny absolutely for calling out the madness of it all i mean hell even lebron james has done that
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:09.960]  see and so the athletes now realize how dumb it all is and they're starting to look into it and ask
[2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:17.880]  questions and i think that that trend is only going to continue um as time goes on here uh
[2:04:17.880 --> 2:04:25.720]  fouchy is in fear folks fouchy is uh he's not having a good time right now he says he's afraid that
[2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:31.800]  if republicans win back the house and have a congressional advantage over democrats there's
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:38.040]  going to be ben gazi type hearings against him yeah that's right fouchy hillary clinton bragged
[2:04:38.040 --> 2:04:43.560]  about how they murdered goddafi hillary clinton and others were involved in the cover-up and the
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:50.520]  death of the americans in ben gazi and you have been responsible for the cover-up of the death
[2:04:50.520 --> 2:04:55.400]  from the vaccines and the death from the virus that you created so yeah there's going to be hearings
[2:04:55.400 --> 2:05:05.000]  on you it's hard to believe that we're already into march 2022 and in the month of february we had a
[2:05:05.000 --> 2:05:12.360]  very popular sale that was going of our flagship product x3 that has all three types of the amazing
[2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:19.640]  iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body your immune system

[2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:44.840]  saying russia is losing but all signs say the opposite zealinski's address this morning and
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:51.960]  biden's 10-minute press address afterwards all of that and we've got still loaded lines here
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:55.880]  we go to steve in ohio steve you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:09:04.440]  hey oh what's up man big fan howdy thank you hey okay so um i was listening to the trump
[2:09:04.440 --> 2:09:10.920]  podcast where he did with those young guys um full sound i believe yeah yeah um actually i was a
[2:09:10.920 --> 2:09:16.920]  little concerned about it because he was talking about how uh like russians were doing genocide
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:21.560]  and like thousands and thousands of civilians were being killed by the russians it was just like
[2:09:21.560 --> 2:09:26.360]  he had a chance to kind of calm tensions and a lot of people are listening to him because
[2:09:26.360 --> 2:09:30.840]  there's no real voice other than maybe like tucker in the mainstream who's just kind of like having
[2:09:30.840 --> 2:09:35.320]  a clear mind but it just seemed like trump was just trying to score political points and it's
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:40.280]  just really frustrating because like i don't care who's in office um at this point i just want
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:47.880]  like the truth to be told you know yeah i hear you and and i'm sure that you know quote unquote
[2:09:47.880 --> 2:09:52.280]  intel agencies or or individuals in the intelligence agencies are feeding trump
[2:09:52.280 --> 2:09:57.960]  this information and maybe it's good information maybe it's not uh he's probably just repeating
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:02.440]  what he's told but he also said on the on i believe it was that podcast it could have been
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:07.240]  a different interview but he also said how he had a good relationship with putin and that he liked
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:13.320]  putin and he was he was confused that at his recent activities and he thought that maybe
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:16.920]  had something had changed in putin i don't think it's that i think it's our leadership changed
[2:10:16.920 --> 2:10:22.840]  and putin just saw strategically it's time to further go into ukraine but what's what's really
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:30.760]  disgusting is trump going on hanity last week and hanity trying to set him up set trump up
[2:10:30.760 --> 2:10:35.160]  that is making him call vladimir putin to work middle making him say all these i mean just
[2:10:35.160 --> 2:10:38.600]  pressing him saying yeah but putin's bad putin's a worker or putin's a murderer putin's committee
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:45.080]  just forcing trump to say that and and trump still remain neutral despite the pressure from neocon hack
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:51.400]  shawn hanity uh i i wonder what investments he has in defense contractors or weapons manufacturers
[2:10:51.400 --> 2:10:56.440]  contractors to to you know support every war that someone else will die in uh he's not going to send
[2:10:56.440 --> 2:11:03.640]  his kids but um yeah i look trump i think trump kind of likes to remain a little unpredictable
[2:11:03.640 --> 2:11:08.600]  and kind of unhinged as well i think that's kind of a geopolitical persona that he likes to have
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:12.920]  he looks at that as a strength uh but but i understand your concerns seeing trump kind of
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:21.800]  jump on the uh russia phobia bandwagon that the uh media loves to loves to abuse
[2:11:23.320 --> 2:11:27.000]  all right steve thank you for the call let's go to patrick in massachusetts patrick you're on the
[2:11:27.000 --> 2:11:33.480]  air go ahead hey how's it going oan good thanks for calling i just wanted to kind of touch real
[2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:38.600]  quick just on the history um just in general people don't understand i mean obviously uh you
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:44.120]  had shawn stone on yesterday i believe and those three films he made uh with his father the uh the
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:50.280]  putin interviews ukraine on fire revealing ukraine kind of go into it but i mean all this is business
[2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:55.960]  as usual when you look at the biden family after the installation of petro poroshenko and the corrupt
[2:11:55.960 --> 2:12:00.920]  energy deals that were done to essentially rob the entire ukrainian people i mean we're just we're
[2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:08.280]  just getting back to business is what it seems like yeah yeah definitely and you know it's
[2:12:08.280 --> 2:12:12.920]  it's really interesting too because you know there was this speculation about some sort of
[2:12:13.480 --> 2:12:17.720]  high quality propaganda video i don't know if you remember this uh i think was the beginning
[2:12:17.720 --> 2:12:22.760]  of february the new york times put it out um you know they said russia was going to
[2:12:23.880 --> 2:12:28.840]  you know fake attacks or something like that to give them the justification for war the pretext
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:34.840]  for war but then when you actually looked at the fake video it seems to all be pro-ukrainian
[2:12:34.840 --> 2:12:40.600]  that's the fake video we're seeing um you know this whole situation is just a mess i really
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:45.560]  wish people would just look at the history because it's all quite clear and it's not even that long
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:52.200]  ago in fact you can google most of it um you know yeah i mean that's that's what's so insane about
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:13:00.600]  all of this like i i'm not going to go back and and recover it all but it's like we found stories
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:09.800]  from 2005 and up to 2014 multiple stories mainstream news stories all talking about barack obama
[2:13:11.240 --> 2:13:17.880]  being involved in bio labs in ukraine and transferring biological material to a lab in
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:23.160]  wuhan china it was all public information it was all official government documents it was all well
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:28.760]  covered at the time and now that it's all backfiring on them and it's once again western politicians
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.480]  are the bad guys the media just acts like it doesn't exist it never happened and then they
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:37.720]  can't even get their story straight between newland and sake and the media and everybody oh the labs
[2:13:37.720 --> 2:13:41.720]  don't exist well they do exist well they don't exist well they're just health labs i mean again
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:46.760]  that's what i'm saying it's like whatever you think i'm done being lied to man i'm done being
[2:13:46.760 --> 2:13:51.400]  lied to i'm not going to hop myself into an alligator pit because a bunch of liars that have
[2:13:51.400 --> 2:13:56.920]  lied to me about everything else say hey go hop into that alligator pit no thank you right and
[2:13:56.920 --> 2:14:01.720]  these people that continue to lie i mean it's one of two things they either uh don't know what's
[2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:06.360]  going on themselves and are in fact incompetent or they just treat us like we're idiots and we
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:12.680]  can't handle the information the sad fact is that you know the end result of this is our you know
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:19.480]  our our rep or how would you say our reputation on the world stage is tainted forever now because
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:23.560]  i do believe this truth is going to come out you know i believe uh the chetkins are involved
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:30.520]  because we decided to spray unknown substance that unknown substances over their fields in 2017
[2:14:30.520 --> 2:14:37.080]  you know it's it's just it's it's all there for people to to find and it's so funny because you
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:46.680]  have the media coming out saying oh look but uh putin is using chetchin terrorists as a a military
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:52.360]  operation that he's got thousands of these chetch chetchin soldiers going into ukraine
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:58.360]  oh the same chetchin soldiers that were trained and armed by the cia it's like again they expect
[2:14:58.360 --> 2:15:04.280]  us not to remember this stuff apparently like 40 000 syrian troops too but it's like oh barack
[2:15:04.280 --> 2:15:10.680]  obama says we're gonna arm moderate rebels in syria it it's just what he calls isle at the time
[2:15:10.680 --> 2:15:15.960]  it's the same terrorist proxy group that the cia has been running for years and and now i guess
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:21.320]  they're deciding they're gonna fight with russia or putin and now the west says oh it's bad they're
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:26.200]  terrorists they're the bad guy the very people they've been arming and training for decades it's
[2:15:26.200 --> 2:15:32.440]  just saddam hussein all over again i mean we gave saddam hussein weapons we gave saddam hussein
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:37.240]  funding and then on the flick of a switch we decided he's the bad guy we're going to war with him now
[2:15:38.440 --> 2:15:42.280]  and by the way this should be mainstream news and i'll mention it when we come back
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:48.200]  you do you realize that they're trying a terrorist on 9 11 saying that this other individual was the
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:52.760]  plotter so so now they're just saying bin laden didn't even do it and they don't even tell us it's
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:59.720]  just oh this was the guy that did it not bin laden experience the next level and high-powered

[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:10.520]  out to dinner i like the metropolitan life i like everything that comes with this but see
[2:17:10.520 --> 2:17:16.520]  i have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat run cities get the
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:22.600]  hell out of major metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is
[2:17:22.600 --> 2:17:26.600]  it time to just move out to the woods just time to go get a piece of property in the woods just
[2:17:26.600 --> 2:17:31.320]  get off grid just get the emergency food supplies just live off the land that's the survival instinct
[2:17:31.320 --> 2:17:36.200]  but see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no no no no
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:40.040]  stay in the city the survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere they've ever
[2:17:40.040 --> 2:17:44.280]  notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask that's the that's the internal struggle
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:50.600]  that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well but you can at least have some
[2:17:50.600 --> 2:17:55.400]  comfort if you have the emergency food supplies and so we have the best ones at m4store.com
[2:17:57.240 --> 2:18:00.520]  with the world awakening i think what's important that we were right there prevent them right now
[2:18:00.520 --> 2:18:04.760]  take advantage of this moment and i have always an idea that something everybody can do with every
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:09.080]  listener can do i think it'd be powerful and effective for us to uh you know hang the banners
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:14.200]  over highways imagine if you're not being on the way up it says Alex Jones is right in the

[2:18:49.960 --> 2:18:54.440]  be affected so that's what i'm calling about god bless you chris in Atlanta i really really
[2:18:54.440 --> 2:18:59.960]  appreciate you calling us today thank you so much anything of real quality anything of lasting
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:05.720]  durability anything that's really satisfying and empowering and fulfilling is going to be hard to
[2:19:05.720 --> 2:19:13.560]  attain and when it comes to information boys that's true today we see the entire global corrupt
[2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:20.600]  into a human depopulation great recent combine trying to collapse our society to build on tashes
[2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:27.320]  their their transhumanist nightmare vision suppressing the voices of good people all around
[2:19:27.320 --> 2:19:33.080]  the world and of doctors and scientists and engineers that are exposing all their lives
[2:19:33.080 --> 2:19:39.160]  their covetous area of their world's gonna end in 2030 carbon tax global warming bull all of it
[2:19:39.720 --> 2:19:45.160]  and none of it can succeed none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:51.000]  silenced and gas lit that's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence
[2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:55.720]  that's why it's hard to share in full wars links and band of video links that's why we've got to
[2:19:55.720 --> 2:20:03.480]  share them now more than ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's
[2:20:03.480 --> 2:20:28.120]  alex jones uh yes this is the official much about the french anthem of the modern day liberal
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:41.960]  progressive i don't know a damn thing all right let me just mention this story i went to the
[2:20:41.960 --> 2:20:47.560]  break with real quick and we'll go back to your phone calls it's amazing how this isn't a bigger
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:51.560]  story it's just we just don't even care that's the problem with americans we're so fat and happy
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:59.400]  and lazy and stupid that uh we just we just don't even care when the government lies to us okay osama
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:05.480]  bin laden did 9 11 is what we were told i don't know how many people still believe that especially
[2:21:05.480 --> 2:21:10.200]  with all the latest lies we've seen from our media that now america's paying attention really since
[2:21:10.200 --> 2:21:19.880]  trump but okay obama obama osama bin laden did 9 11 and we went to war over it and we spent billions
[2:21:19.880 --> 2:21:25.240]  of dollars overseas and it was a war on islamic terrorism and all this other stuff well today
[2:21:27.000 --> 2:21:33.720]  and then i'm quoting from just the news dot com uh john sullivan site but you can find the story
[2:21:33.720 --> 2:21:39.240]  anywhere government prosecutors for 9 11 attacks are in plea talks that could avert death penalty
[2:21:39.240 --> 2:21:46.920]  for the accused tell me if you hear anything here that is a little odd prosecutors have begun talks
[2:21:46.920 --> 2:21:54.120]  with the attorneys for a colleague seek mohammed the man accused of plotting september 11 2001
[2:21:54.120 --> 2:22:00.200]  attacks and his four co-defendants to negotiate a plea deal that would eliminate the possibility of
[2:22:00.200 --> 2:22:13.000]  execution what the man accused of plotting september 11 so silently our government is saying
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:21.640]  it wasn't osama bin laden we're now saying it was khalid mohammed what is going on here
[2:22:23.720 --> 2:22:30.120]  did osama bin laden ever have anything to do with 9 11 was it saudi arabia was it our own
[2:22:30.920 --> 2:22:34.120]  politicians was it all of them what the hell is going on
[2:22:34.120 --> 2:22:41.080]  on i'm just asking legitimately reasonable questions here
[2:22:44.440 --> 2:22:50.840]  federal prosecutors are now going off the man accused of plotting september 11 and his name
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:58.760]  is not osama bin laden it's khalid mohammed i mean what what what is going on here
[2:22:58.760 --> 2:23:07.080]  here well let me just put it simply for you you were lied to about 9 11
[2:23:08.680 --> 2:23:14.120]  and you should be pissed off about it now let's go back out to the phone lines
[2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:21.880]  we've got mcqueen called in from georgia mcqueen you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[2:23:22.920 --> 2:23:28.040]  hey how you doing today i'm good thank you all right uh really quick i just want to touch on
[2:23:28.040 --> 2:23:35.480]  a couple things um i haul i'm a flatbed hauler so i uh i go down from like the chicago market to
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:42.840]  the atlanta market almost every week um a couple weeks ago the rate from atlanta back up to chicago
[2:23:42.840 --> 2:23:47.800]  was anywhere from 21 to 28 if you're lucky and are you talking about when you say rate are you
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:53.720]  talking about when you have to stop at weigh stations no the rate as in like the the the
[2:23:53.720 --> 2:24:00.200]  rate of pay that they give us for the load oh oh your pay rate okay yeah because we we we negotiate
[2:24:00.200 --> 2:24:04.840]  with the brokers who have the customer um and they say hey we'll give you this much to haul the
[2:24:04.840 --> 2:24:12.040]  load so we say yes or no um and typically it's around 25 26 maybe 28 if you're lucky last week
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:20.440]  i got paid 45 uh for lumber and this week it's 48 and also uh going from the chicago market out to
[2:24:20.440 --> 2:24:28.200]  like idaho uh that used to pay about 4300 bucks last year now it's paying 8 000 and those are real
[2:24:28.200 --> 2:24:35.640]  rates that i get and so it's just a just a call saying hey you know rates are going up a lot so
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:43.080]  we already know inflation's coming but it's you know it's really coming but um and the other thing
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:48.280]  was the whole the whole cia thing about you know yahoo said all the cia has been training this and
[2:24:48.280 --> 2:24:53.240]  that whatever i think that's just uh it was a failed attempt to boost morale trying to make us
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:58.440]  feel like special or something oh yeah like oh we're so great we've been training neo-nazi's
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:04.200]  in ukraine ha ha look at how look how great we are yeah yeah because i mean you think about it
[2:25:04.200 --> 2:25:08.200]  they're only going to see all we've been over there the cia great you know it makes us feel
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:13.240]  like oh we're untouchable we're great we've been there a long time you know but when in reality
[2:25:13.240 --> 2:25:17.720]  we're being lied to anyway and so it's a whole bunch of cracker crap yeah you do have to wonder
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:22.360]  why they decided to uh make this a mainstream news story all the sudden when when we've known
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:29.800]  it's been going on for years yeah yeah it's oh it's a yahoo exclusive like oh nobody knew it was
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:35.960]  a big secret yeah okay they probably watch you guys and then just come out with it a month later
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:41.560]  and say oh it's an exclusive they you know because they think nobody watches you but that's the rude

[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:48.680]  here in america is getting pulled out of russia like you think that's a bad thing like i wish they

[2:28:18.680 --> 2:28:23.880]  then it usually lasts till y'all get it back in stock i'm just you know that's my personal experience
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:29.880]  and i took that uh silver round i got from y'all claimed it real good because of the uh
[2:28:29.880 --> 2:28:34.920]  point nine nine percent silver in it and i put that in my elect the pure water filter

[2:28:50.680 --> 2:28:54.360]  call more calls on the other side is the alex jones show
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:02.680]  two of our best selling products are back in stock then fullwarstore.com and they will sell
[2:29:02.680 --> 2:29:06.760]  out in the next three four months before i get more of the product in if i sell it at full price
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:11.320]  but i want those of you that have been on the fence about getting one or son
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:17.560]  or getting x3 to try the products and see how amazing they are and i believe you will then
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:22.920]  get hooked on them like myself and my family and the crew are so again both these products are back
[2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:30.120]  in stock both x3 and one or son they are 50 off for a limited time because they're going to sell
[2:29:30.120 --> 2:29:36.360]  out at this price i would estimate in less than a month so this is your chance to get x3 and
[2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:40.040]  experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens this is your chance to have the highest
[2:29:40.040 --> 2:29:45.000]  quality vitamin d3 with vitamin k for your muses as well they're amazing and they're an
[2:29:45.000 --> 2:29:51.240]  infowarstore.com and the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation i need funds to run
[2:29:51.240 --> 2:29:55.400]  the operation you need to be healthy we need to stay on air it's a match made in heaven
[2:29:56.520 --> 2:30:02.760]  the globalist social engineers always intended to push their covid biomedical tyranny
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:10.120]  lockdowns until the populations rebelled they would then use that as the pretext for permanent
[2:30:10.120 --> 2:30:16.440]  martial law and banning and arresting anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of
[2:30:16.440 --> 2:30:21.880]  so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers
[2:30:22.600 --> 2:30:29.160]  now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government
[2:30:29.160 --> 2:30:35.080]  corporate takeover and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some
[2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:40.440]  globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover like canada but they've now
[2:30:40.440 --> 2:30:46.360]  declared a civil emergency and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following
[2:30:46.360 --> 2:30:51.720]  suit like australia so pray for these folks big time this is a very serious situation and stay
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:58.760]  tuned into info wars dot com because truth is absolutely paramount so i did it i signed up for
[2:30:58.760 --> 2:31:04.120]  the austin marathon i've been training probably not as much as they should be but thank goodness for
[2:31:04.120 --> 2:31:10.520]  prayer and thank goodness for info wars store dot com before i start out on a run i throw down some
[2:31:10.520 --> 2:31:16.840]  turbo force to give me that energy i need to get going you know besides the energy turbo force it is
[2:31:16.840 --> 2:31:21.880]  giving me the vitamins i need like vitamin c to keep me healthy and the essential b vitamins
[2:31:21.880 --> 2:31:27.080]  plus the amino acids for sustained energy giving me the best chance at getting through the training
[2:31:27.080 --> 2:31:33.800]  and then every day now i'm taking dr jones sore less i have bad joints thanks mom so this is
[2:31:33.800 --> 2:31:38.760]  great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now plus inflammation support
[2:31:38.760 --> 2:31:43.880]  and extra flexibility the quick release capsules help me recover fast so i can get back to the
[2:31:43.880 --> 2:31:49.720]  training even if you are not crazy enough to take on a marathon good news turbo force that can still
[2:31:49.720 --> 2:31:54.440]  give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore less can keep you moving and feeling
[2:31:54.440 --> 2:32:04.040]  great at any age granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air glad challenge
[2:32:04.040 --> 2:32:10.360]  first of all let me say i love your products i am a granny and um for all the senior citizens out
[2:32:10.360 --> 2:32:15.880]  there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots
[2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:21.720]  as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just
[2:32:21.720 --> 2:32:28.360]  really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:33.080]  supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because i just thought it was a
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:38.200]  hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen immediately but you know
[2:32:38.200 --> 2:32:44.360]  over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:51.160]  wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so anyway it works
[2:32:51.160 --> 2:33:01.320]  wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:04.600]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:04.600 --> 2:33:24.600]  you've found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with owin troyer
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:34.840]  you know i want to mention here that there is a trucker convoy in dc and apparently today
[2:33:36.600 --> 2:33:43.160]  they are being discriminated against by the dc police when they see a truck or a car with an
[2:33:43.160 --> 2:33:50.760]  american flag they're pulling them over and harassing them which i'm i'm i'm sad to say this i'm not
[2:33:50.760 --> 2:33:57.560]  trying to be uh cold here but it's probably the best thing that's happened to that convoy that's
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:02.360]  getting no press coverage and and really has barely even made a ripple i'm not trying to be rude or
[2:34:02.360 --> 2:34:06.440]  slight those individuals i say godspeed keep the trucker convoy going we love you americans
[2:34:06.440 --> 2:34:13.160]  you're free to loving americans fighting for us but apparently today the cops and the government
[2:34:13.160 --> 2:34:17.720]  are getting really active in trying to shut it down so it might finally be making some
[2:34:17.720 --> 2:34:23.640]  headlines today you might finally start to see some video clips of this today and we'll see if
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:30.200]  this hardens the resolve of that convoy that is still occupying dc in some way shape or form the
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:38.520]  problem is nobody goes in dc anymore dc is a dead town so i get the idea hey let's go to dc the
[2:34:38.520 --> 2:34:45.320]  nation's capital where the biggest american criminals hang out but dc is dead folks the
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:51.320]  democrats have killed washington dc nobody goes out to eat the streets are always empty there's
[2:34:51.320 --> 2:34:59.640]  violent crime every night uh dc has been killed by the democrats and it was amazing because dc was
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:07.160]  once a a really bad area and then it kind of had a bit of a revival and once again had a night life
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:12.520]  and and a and a daily life and it was busy and it was an attraction and it was kind of starting to
[2:35:12.520 --> 2:35:17.400]  boom again and then the democrats got back into power with all their covet crap and dc is just
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:23.560]  dead again so i'm not sure if it'll ever come back anymore uh the disgusting district of criminals
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:28.840]  but uh the trucker convoy is still there and apparently now being harassed
[2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:32.440]  by law enforcement just more political persecution just more political bigotry
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:39.400]  from the dc police you hate to see it we we go back to the phone lines now mic calling in from
[2:35:39.400 --> 2:35:44.840]  missouri mic you're on the alex joneshow go ahead how's it going yeah it's good thanks for calling
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:52.440]  thanks uh i was first i want to say about the sanctions that putin put on biden i mean on one
[2:35:52.440 --> 2:36:00.520]  hand i think it kind of was a bad press you know look because it just encouraged all these you
[2:36:00.520 --> 2:36:06.920]  know npcs in america to be like you know to just forward the ukraine movement you know look at
[2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:11.480]  putin he's being that you know he's being a dig day he's a jerk you know because nobody looks at
[2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:16.680]  what we do in america they just look at what other people do to us so first i'm like and that's kind
[2:36:16.680 --> 2:36:22.680]  of an odd play to say you can't come into our country but then i heard that ukraine isn't really
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:28.600]  a country it's still part of russia so i wonder if that's like he's going to freeze their assets
[2:36:28.600 --> 2:36:34.120]  that they do have in ukraine you know i don't i don't know much about the rules on that and then
[2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:39.160]  it makes me wonder like how much taiwan is going to get if they get it they are we going to show
[2:36:39.160 --> 2:36:46.040]  out 35 billion to taiwan to you know to to boost their their military or whatever it's going to be
[2:36:46.040 --> 2:36:51.320]  an interesting juxtaposition if and when that goes down in taiwan and uh yeah that that's going to
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:55.240]  be an interesting juxtaposition uh with with what's been happening in ukraine and everything
[2:36:56.280 --> 2:37:01.720]  and as a as a gen X kid like i grew up in the cold war so i'm i'm war never really
[2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:07.320]  you know surprises me or makes me feel kind of cautious because like for example
[2:37:08.280 --> 2:37:12.520]  couldn't just threaten to anyone who interfered right he said there's going to be conscious and
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:18.440]  then biden gets on tv and does it you know so it's always like this it's just a bunch of people it's
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:23.000]  it's like they say they're old men talk any young men dying because that's all they do they just
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:28.360]  show money all over the place and there's never really you never know what's going on because
[2:37:28.360 --> 2:37:33.400]  there's there's all these news people putting out everybody's got to be the first person
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:39.560]  to say something about it and that's all that news is it's new and now you combine that with this new
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:48.920]  aspect of virtue signaling as hard as you can and so that creates a a bias that that taints the the
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:55.560]  representation in the media as well oh i'm going to virtue signal so hard for ukraine
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:00.520]  i don't even care if it's inaccurate oh the ghost to kiavo snake island oh the russian
[2:38:00.520 --> 2:38:04.840]  killing the journalist oh and and it's just it's all inaccurate but they they're but they're virtue
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:10.200]  signaling so hard like that's reporting now is just virtue signaling yeah and like when this
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:15.640]  covid thing hit you know everybody was getting laid off mercy well my job i was getting more
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:19.880]  over time and i'm just getting pounded with it they weren't putting masks on us they weren't
[2:38:19.880 --> 2:38:23.400]  vaccinating that they weren't doing anything because we had to keep working at what part of
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:29.320]  Missouri are you in i'm in the i'm in the kansas city area okay so you're in the western area
[2:38:30.040 --> 2:38:35.160]  yeah and and i kept thinking like this can't be real like how could this possibly be real
[2:38:35.160 --> 2:38:40.440]  because all these people on tv are freaking out i'm over here like i got it i just worked 14 hours
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:46.040]  and now i gotta go in on my day off you know and i'm like this isn't real this this is all a tv
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:52.120]  because like i said when we grew up tv kind of switched over we were the first kids to have that
[2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:55.880]  i don't know if you remember that box where you could slide the channels up and down you
[2:38:55.880 --> 2:39:00.840]  had like 80 channels on that little brown box we can we can just sit there we grew up with that
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:07.480]  you can turn you can surf the news and watch 60 different programs and they're all saying the same
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:11.080]  thing in a different way and everything becomes you know excuse my friends but it all becomes
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:16.920]  bullshit and it takes like it takes almost a week before you find out the real story you know like
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:22.200]  you're like you're just saying about the osama bin Laden it's like it always takes them forever to
[2:39:22.200 --> 2:39:28.040]  come out with some of the the cia story because they they just bs you all the way through and
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:33.400]  repeat it repeat it repeat it no no no that's the the seat and that's been my biggest you know that's
[2:39:33.400 --> 2:39:39.320]  why i came on air saying this today this shouldn't even be a controversial stance this this shouldn't
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:45.960]  be something americans have to debate or sort out we have been lied to about so much i mean even
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:50.680]  beyond obviously the ukraine situation but it's like we've just been lied to so much about the
[2:39:50.680 --> 2:39:56.120]  situation in ukraine now why would we invest anything over there why would we get involved
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:40:00.360]  at all why why should we continue to throw all this emotion or money or weapons or all this
[2:40:00.360 --> 2:40:06.120]  other stuff at the ukraine situation when everything we've been told about it is a lie i mean that's
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:16.200]  just i mean it it's just it's it's low iq zero intellect it's it's completely idiotic moronic
[2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:19.480]  behavior is what it is but that's what we deal with in this country mike thank you so much for
[2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:27.320]  the call let's go to steve in wisconsin steve you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey oh and
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:33.080]  so i have to be honest i think this is what we really need under one we really want the demon

[2:40:40.360 --> 2:40:48.200]  need them to do and then the emblem of ukrainian ground forces it was on zolinski's t-shirt i you
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:53.400]  know i just don't want to jump to conclusions if there's nazis hiding all over the place uh yes
[2:40:54.280 --> 2:41:01.400]  ukraine has a history of nazism yes it was a bastion of it yes after world war two that's where
[2:41:01.400 --> 2:41:06.760]  all the nazis went and hid however come into paragraph yeah well hold on now that that's the
[2:41:06.760 --> 2:41:12.840]  nazis that the u.s government didn't hire to run all of our programs you mean 100 100 percent but
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:17.720]  i don't want to jump to that conclusion and ukraine already has its own problems i i'm a
[2:41:17.720 --> 2:41:23.480]  political atheist with all this stuff you know right now you have ukrainian men flooding into
[2:41:23.480 --> 2:41:30.520]  the polish border ukrainian and polish border guards are pushing them back because on on on books

[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:43.320]  nothing out of it so it's a money pit i think we need to completely step out bingo debt

[2:41:55.320 --> 2:42:01.160]  the debt and reducing the deficit it's biden he never lies of course but these are all numbers
[2:42:01.160 --> 2:42:07.640]  that people need to know right now we're sitting at 30.29 trillion and that's on u.s government

[2:42:40.600 --> 2:42:47.240]  rest of this news on my desk ahead of k dally taking over the fourth hour it's the alex joneshow
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:53.800]  and it's your support at info wars store dot com that keeps this transmission on the air
[2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:02.120]  alex jones here with a very simple proposal for all our great info wars listeners and viewers
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:08.920]  if you will simply get x3 with all three types of good iodine that boosts your immune system and
[2:43:08.920 --> 2:43:14.040]  help everything that goes on your body at the cellular level it will change your life it will
[2:43:14.040 --> 2:43:20.840]  invigorate you it will empower you almost everyone has iodine deficiency look into it for yourself
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:27.160]  it's the opposite of fluoride it's the good halogen and then your purchase of x3 funds our
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:32.040]  operation now a lot of our products have been sold out and never came back in because the lockdowns
[2:43:32.040 --> 2:43:37.080]  and supply chain breakouts we were sold out of x3 for a long time and i had it on sale for 50
[2:43:37.080 --> 2:43:41.160]  percent off a lot of folks were getting it and i was thinking you know what i'm gonna bring it back
[2:43:41.160 --> 2:43:45.960]  on sale again just until it sells out because even though we won't make as much money in the long
[2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:50.680]  run a lot of folks need this product and we need to get the money from the sales in now to stay on
[2:43:50.680 --> 2:44:00.280]  air see your x3 right now at 50 percent off at info wars store dot com get our great bag of it here
[2:44:00.280 --> 2:44:05.560]  i mean this is from people say why is it from Chiapas mexico the communist well that's where
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:11.080]  some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better
[2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:15.320]  than watermelon coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:19.160]  communists but really they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee
[2:44:19.160 --> 2:44:22.760]  and we've got it and the farmers don't let the mexican government take over so i actually buy
[2:44:22.760 --> 2:44:26.440]  this from the mexican rebels and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone
[2:44:26.440 --> 2:44:31.320]  up the same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50 percent more per pound and i just
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:35.240]  think it's some of the best coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend
[2:44:35.240 --> 2:44:43.720]  from the Chiapas rebels literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story um we had like that

[2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:22.600]  where they come and take quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety
[2:45:22.600 --> 2:45:27.240]  this is nothing less than martial law and one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high

[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:17.880]  but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty and speech and massive censorship
[2:46:17.880 --> 2:46:24.120]  and now across the world from the united states to europe legislations being introduced that if

[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:21.320]  and how will it impact any of you if at all sure i would first note that president biden is a junior
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:27.080]  so uh they may have may have sanctioned his dad may he rest in peace um the second piece i would say
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:34.280]  is that you uh that none of us are planning uh tourist trips to russia none of us have made
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:40.840]  accounts that we won't be able to access so we will forge ahead thank you oh uh it's all a big
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:48.200]  joke uh biden sanctioned me ha ha ha it's just funny how nobody here's going to rush anytime

[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:09.400]  worst press secretary ever biggest liar in the history of us press secretaries but that just
[2:48:09.400 --> 2:48:14.760]  follows suit with uh the standard the president is setting it's all fun and games folks here's
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:22.440]  joe biden forgetting who he himself is in clip one stage but that's enough too look at the stage
[2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:27.240]  but there's been a little change in the arrangement who's on the stage because of
[2:48:27.800 --> 2:48:33.800]  the first lady's husband uh contracting covid but uh look at this room and what you see
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:46.680]  the party that's you joe that's right that's me that's not together

[2:49:07.720 --> 2:49:15.400]  blast it's just so much fun and then the media and the democrats get confused at why we don't
[2:49:15.400 --> 2:49:24.760]  hate putin like they want us to because you suck and we're a little preoccupied dealing with you
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:33.080]  and you know what i'm glad putin sanctioned you the us people should have sanctioned you a long

[2:50:57.320 --> 2:51:05.320]  put these memes on the screen um that that i said but but see i'm so sick of this notion that we're
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:12.680]  supposed to buy into that oh the poor gays oh the poor homosexuals they're so discriminated against
[2:51:12.680 --> 2:51:18.920]  that's so oppressive the entire system props you up you come out as gay overnight you're a hero
[2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:25.000]  you have pride months you have all these different fortune 500 mainstream companies they all make
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:31.480]  their logos gay don't tell me that being gay in america is an oppressive thing don't tell me that
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:35.960]  if you're gay you're somehow discriminated against no you're praised you're lifted up even if you've
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:43.480]  done nothing and all of corporate america supports you so shut the hell up you're not victims i'm
[2:51:43.480 --> 2:51:48.840]  sick and damn tired of it and guess what so we're gay people because it's all just more liberal bs
[2:51:50.520 --> 2:51:56.360]  and i think that this meme pretty much sums it up quite frankly and uh it's a it's a person
[2:51:57.000 --> 2:52:04.280]  with a tuba and it's the it's the gay pride flag with the lgbt propaganda as the french horn and
[2:52:04.280 --> 2:52:09.400]  they're just blowing it in our face and it's me trying to live my life mind my own business but
[2:52:09.400 --> 2:52:18.120]  it's just the lgbt gay global homo propaganda just blowing us up non-stop and i'm sick and tired of
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:25.240]  it and guess what so is putin and so is jizhin ping and so is so is saudi arabia and egypt and the
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:32.840]  ua e and syria and brazil and mexico and the american media is not telling you anything about it
[2:52:32.840 --> 2:52:39.080]  because they hate you and they're in on the joke and they just love bringing it to kids
[2:52:40.040 --> 2:52:44.280]  and they lie and they say oh there's a don't say gay bill in florida doesn't even exist
[2:52:44.280 --> 2:52:50.360]  and so then the gay mafia goes on to tiktok and uh does this video just bragging about how they
[2:52:50.360 --> 2:52:56.680]  indoctrinate your kids and sexualize your kids in clip 2 showing up to teach fourth grade the day

[2:54:26.920 --> 2:54:32.520]  isn't about trans people it's about one thing and one thing only pedophiles that want access to your
[2:54:32.520 --> 2:54:40.040]  kids that virtue signal about gayness or transgenderism as the access point as the conduit to getting
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:46.280]  their hands on your children in the classrooms in the doctor's offices in the libraries anywhere
[2:54:46.280 --> 2:54:52.280]  they can do it they're damn pedophiles they're damn deviance even if they're not pedophiles

[3:03:00.440 --> 3:03:04.600]  this guy's had a weird strange awakening here in the last couple months getting getting hit
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:09.080]  by snowballs when he tries to do a live stream having his right aid robbed right in front of
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:13.960]  his face and then being shut down because of the robbery crimes happening right outside of his door
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:17.960]  now he apparently tries to go on the new york subway and it's just littered with trash yeah
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:27.240]  it's called democrat party rule and then you have stories like this ross employee shot
[3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:34.920]  after helping his colleague who is being harassed by a group of teens teenagers yes teens
[3:03:36.680 --> 3:03:42.920]  teens uh rod rick joseph was the hero
[3:03:42.920 --> 3:03:51.880]  and elderly lady was being harassed by this group of teens teens at a ross and he stepped in and
[3:03:51.880 --> 3:03:57.320]  said hey leave this woman alone then he saw them plotting something and he said you guys
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:03.800]  need to leave now they pulled out a gun and shot him a group of teens a group of teens
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:10.200]  blm leader and boston's woman of the year is arrested and indicted on federal charges for

[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:30.760]  joe biden who says you're only black if you vote for him i forgive my son for working with the fbi
[3:04:30.760 --> 3:04:34.840]  to convict me exclusive interview with convicted january sixth political prisoner guy ref it from
[3:04:34.840 --> 3:04:38.120]  dc gitmo that's from kara kastronova she's going to be joining me on the war room later this week
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:42.600]  breaking all that down by the way all of these protesters you see in russia including the one
[3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:46.760]  that went on tv yeah they're getting arrested folks they're getting released within an hour
[3:04:46.760 --> 3:04:52.680]  in russia january sixth prisoners are treated worse here than people in russia so so quit talking
[3:04:52.680 --> 3:04:59.080]  about pudin as an oppressor mike in california thanks for calling i think we're barking up the
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:05.240]  wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual you know 2014 legislation
[3:05:05.240 --> 3:05:11.480]  the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research funding pause on selected
[3:05:11.480 --> 3:05:15.960]  gain of function research involving influenza mers and dars viruses there's nothing about
[3:05:15.960 --> 3:05:21.720]  stars like viruses and it's a research funding pause it's not a stop it's not a prohibition it's
[3:05:21.720 --> 3:05:25.880]  when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stops on you stop you look both ways and
[3:05:25.880 --> 3:05:31.320]  then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just selected gain of function
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:36.200]  but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and qualification research so
[3:05:36.200 --> 3:05:39.800]  you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite know what they're
[3:05:39.800 --> 3:05:43.480]  talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't perjure himself that's
[3:05:43.480 --> 3:05:47.640]  why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic life forms that
[3:05:47.640 --> 3:05:52.280]  mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function you're
[3:05:52.280 --> 3:05:56.040]  making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you
[3:05:56.040 --> 3:06:05.960]  hi welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host from kate dally radio dot

[3:06:30.920 --> 3:06:35.720]  fourth interview with him over the years and he always has something very very intriguing to say

[3:06:59.160 --> 3:07:06.360]  markets and in 2004 he launched a very popular website called golden hyphen jacks jackass dot

[3:07:23.560 --> 3:07:28.360]  everything is strange yeah everything is strange it can't get any weirder and i think
[3:07:28.360 --> 3:07:32.840]  we're we're feeling like we're being hit from every side in every angle and i get it and i
[3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:38.120]  think a lot of people just feel fatigued but we're always worried about money we're always
[3:07:38.120 --> 3:07:42.360]  because it affects all of us right and so we're always worried about housing crypto all of these
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:49.080]  things so let's let's uh let's talk just a little bit about crypto and about what you know the other
[3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:53.720]  shoe dropping what what do you well we could probably do a little lesson in history talk
[3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:58.440]  about china and russia and then talk about those moving parts and how they affect us monetarily
[3:08:00.600 --> 3:08:10.920]  you want me to start with uh 1998 and china and the reunification okay okay back in 1998
[3:08:10.920 --> 3:08:18.040]  hong kong reverted back to chinese control and it was a complicated deal and a lot of secret
[3:08:18.040 --> 3:08:26.680]  elements to that deal what was known to most people in the public was that hong kong would go back
[3:08:26.680 --> 3:08:34.120]  to chinese rule and they would allow it to remain independent they had their regional governor
[3:08:34.120 --> 3:08:39.560]  commissioner whatever they call it and nothing would change and hong kong would remain an
[3:08:39.560 --> 3:08:45.400]  interesting experiment where china would observe what's going on but there were some hidden elements
[3:08:45.400 --> 3:08:52.760]  to that one big hill hidden element was that the chinese would lend i don't know exactly how much
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:56.280]  i'm thinking it might have been something like three or five thousand tons of gold
[3:08:57.080 --> 3:09:03.160]  and there was a significant amount of silver there was also lent so we had a big lease of
[3:09:03.160 --> 3:09:11.800]  gold and silver the chinese being greatly distrustful of the british think about 100 years ago the
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:18.600]  opium wars box your belly and all that they decided well the only way we're going to lease gold to you
[3:09:18.600 --> 3:09:23.640]  is if you promise some things so the united states and britain and the west promised
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:29.960]  a significant amount of foreign direct investment and my understanding is that it was about 23
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:43.480]  billion dollars in 2001 02 and 03 okay the chinese did not accept just that they decided we need some
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:51.080]  collateral we need something because you tend not to return your gold and silver that is leased to
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:10:00.680]  you so true to form united states did not return the golden silver but what they did get in return was
[3:10:00.680 --> 3:10:10.200]  a what i call an internal revenue service secure stream bond think what as a macro version of a
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:17.080]  mortgage bond a national version and because of the deep recession that occurred in 2003 4 and 5
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:26.680]  that we never admitted to we defaulted on that bond to china and china with their agents at hand
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:34.920]  a chinese conglomerate property firm sees control of the jp morgan headquarters property
[3:10:34.920 --> 3:10:45.960]  and according to the reports it was something like a 350 million dollar payment that locked in
[3:10:47.000 --> 3:10:55.960]  their seizure of the property and included a tower a conference center and a nuclear proof
[3:10:56.920 --> 3:11:03.480]  gold vaults that connected to the federal reserve okay so they got a bargain basement
[3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:10.520]  price for the jp morgan headquarters okay fine but something else happened cake that's really really
[3:11:10.520 --> 3:11:17.960]  ugly and that is something that they don't talk about and it is that jp morgan became
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:25.000]  an agent for the chinese government in locating and securing silver and gold in particular silver
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:32.280]  because that was used for their industrial development which took off as we know last decade
[3:11:32.280 --> 3:11:39.320]  two decades ago it's amazing to think we're 2022 golly this is these are dates that we had in
[3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:47.480]  science fiction futuristic movies but jp morgan is an agent for securing silver to replenish the
[3:11:47.480 --> 3:11:58.680]  chinese stockpile wow um it's a lot and you know that you talk a lot about too about the chinese
[3:11:58.680 --> 3:12:05.240]  buying up the fanny uh the fanny main mortgage bonds and helping to create the 2008 crisis too
[3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:11.800]  there was a lot going on since 1998 with the chinese in our country let me give that quick story
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:22.200]  okay when china developed their industrial power it was foundries factories car plants
[3:12:22.200 --> 3:12:29.080]  motorcycle plants car parts pharmaceuticals a lot of different things they quickly acquired an enormous
[3:12:30.360 --> 3:12:40.280]  trade surplus and just like with the arab partners we required on the back end that china
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:49.320]  remain in the dollar and not cash out of those dollar surplus funds so what they did was they
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:59.640]  bought treasury bonds they bought fanny may bonds they made deposits in wells fargo california bank
[3:13:00.280 --> 3:13:09.240]  they went shopping um for commercial buildings in the united states i heard it that by late
[3:13:10.280 --> 3:13:15.800]  by the end of the 2000 decade china owned one third of commercial properties in the united states
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:22.440]  and what they did was they used collateral of treasury bonds and borrowed 10 times that amount
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:27.880]  who could object in the banking industry to treasury bonds as collateral for a loan 10 to
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:35.960]  one loan okay but they accumulated a lot of mortgage bonds fanny may mortgage bonds and
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:44.840]  when we reneged on the gold and silver lease and didn't pay back by 2005 which i believe was the
[3:13:44.840 --> 3:13:50.360]  deadline date hard to get information like this out of wall street because they prefer their corrupt
[3:13:50.360 --> 3:14:00.840]  ways um they started china started selling the fanny may bonds that was 2005 so they they began
[3:14:00.840 --> 3:14:08.280]  a process that gained tremendous momentum and resulted in the the layman brothers incident
[3:14:08.280 --> 3:14:15.160]  and few people realized that jp morgan and goldman sex owned a lot more mortgage bonds
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:22.040]  than layman brothers did but as i mentioned before layman brothers was the odd man out
[3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:29.400]  in wall street just like bare sterns was the odd man out in 2003 bare sterns was
[3:14:30.040 --> 3:14:37.240]  long gold and short the dollar that's not how you get along among the brethren yeah those are
[3:14:37.240 --> 3:14:47.080]  they were pretty gold bars they were sacrificed right so uh on the chopping block uh bare sterns
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:53.720]  and layman brothers were murdered as companies right uh layman brothers was suffocated to death
[3:14:53.720 --> 3:14:59.720]  because they sold a bunch of mortgage bonds and were never paid by jp morgan and goldman sacks
[3:14:59.720 --> 3:15:07.880]  those are the two top criminal uh banking enterprises in the united states along with maybe
[3:15:07.880 --> 3:15:14.760]  black rock black rock we're gonna go to a break soon but i did want to mention um as jim and i
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:19.800]  were talking off air as well they of course we all know that they they acquired the alaskan

[3:16:16.040 --> 3:16:21.640]  volatility really really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been
[3:16:21.640 --> 3:16:28.040]  heated up and so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions they also work quite well
[3:16:28.040 --> 3:16:32.760]  but just aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is
[3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:36.600]  different sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling
[3:16:36.600 --> 3:16:40.520]  something and admitting sometimes the batch is in a strong that's just how it is it's how it works
[3:16:40.520 --> 3:16:46.760]  uh so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls

[3:20:13.560 --> 3:20:19.640]  dally your guest host my guest is dr jim willi in this hour who writes the hat trick letter newsletter
[3:20:19.640 --> 3:20:25.000]  you must check this out you must subscribe he's got insights i've never heard anywhere else i love
[3:20:25.000 --> 3:20:30.200]  jim how you bring history into this picture you started noticing things in 2019 that play into
[3:20:30.200 --> 3:20:36.360]  this financial picture right now and as a cautionary tell for what's maybe about to happen to a precursor
[3:20:36.360 --> 3:20:43.160]  to of course blovid that came in in 2020 and king fraud a lot who came into power so what did you
[3:20:43.160 --> 3:20:52.680]  notice in 2019 it was the explosion of the repo market the us treasury repurchase market
[3:20:53.880 --> 3:21:01.080]  it's an overnight window where a big bank like in wall street can say take a billion dollars
[3:21:01.080 --> 3:21:07.320]  worth of treasury bonds or bills and get cash so it's it's the other way around they're not buying
[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:15.880]  a bond they're trading in a bond for some cash okay i hope you didn't lose me right my screen
[3:21:15.880 --> 3:21:27.320]  froze okay um so this is a very important window the repo market is where banks reveal their insolvency
[3:21:29.240 --> 3:21:35.000]  they are essentially saying we're in trouble we don't have cash to maintain our operations
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:41.960]  make payroll you know handle all the different redemptions and we need to hand over some treasuries
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:52.280]  and get some cash okay back in august september october of 2019 the repo market exploded and i
[3:21:52.280 --> 3:21:56.920]  made a forecast early in that period that we were going to get to a trillion dollars a night
[3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:02.600]  and a lot of people thought that's crazy well yeah it's crazy everything's crazy in the us dollar
[3:22:02.600 --> 3:22:11.160]  financial sector we got over a trillion it was somewhere around 1.3 or 1.4 trillion and i thought
[3:22:11.160 --> 3:22:20.120]  in october uh oh here we go this could be the end of the dollar system this could be a magnificent
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:30.760]  banking crisis that would eclipse 2008 with the mortgage bond situation often called layman crisis
[3:22:30.760 --> 3:22:39.480]  um and instead of getting a major financial crisis what we got was a jump shift we moved
[3:22:39.480 --> 3:22:47.080]  from the financial highway of control to the medical highway of control and we got the fake
[3:22:47.080 --> 3:22:54.760]  pandemic right i i don't want to get into a lot of the different aspects of say wuhan and
[3:22:54.760 --> 3:23:02.200]  you know false medical data diagnoses i have i got tipped off very early i had a very good friend
[3:23:02.200 --> 3:23:07.960]  his father died of a stroke and they called it coveted a different friend had a father who died
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:13.800]  of a heart attack they called that coveted okay i i wow everything's coveted okay they got to make
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:20.600]  the numbers and then i noticed i produced a chart from may of 2020 it was the disappearance
[3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:29.400]  of influenza because they're calling it coveted so four years in a row the data was very very steady
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:38.920]  and then 2020 whoops got a 60 80 drop in the influenza cases screens from this i have
[3:23:38.920 --> 3:23:44.440]  actual screenshots as i was tracking all of this isn't that crazy i just totally dipped down and so
[3:23:44.440 --> 3:23:51.000]  king fraud a lot gets into power um and little hormola and uh and so what what happens then was
[3:23:51.000 --> 3:23:55.000]  that the death of the dollar we just didn't know it was it being propped up at that point
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:02.840]  that was the death of the dollar because they delayed information on how much the big banks
[3:24:02.840 --> 3:24:10.200]  were given relief i called big bank welfare they called us coveted stimulus relief fund
[3:24:10.200 --> 3:24:18.040]  and and information came out just a few weeks ago that uh five trillion dollars was granted to
[3:24:18.040 --> 3:24:26.520]  the big wall street banks in late 2019 exactly at that point and and the repo market had another
[3:24:26.520 --> 3:24:33.080]  aspect kate it was really quite interesting they expanded it from just the wall street banks and
[3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:40.440]  they included the hedge funds because they're run by wall street they buy treasury bonds and
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:47.800]  they do arbitrage trade they buy treasuries and sell interest rate swap derivatives capture 30 basis
[3:24:47.800 --> 3:24:57.160]  points in profit and amplify it 100 fold with leverage it's just a big game so they had to
[3:24:57.160 --> 3:25:04.040]  include the hedge fund okay we started seeing the money go up in trillions right go ahead yes
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:13.080]  the stimulus relief plans funds and acts the bills with congress they were in the trillions
[3:25:13.800 --> 3:25:23.000]  and we suddenly saw a move from 22 to 24 25 trillion as us government dead and i thought
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:32.280]  this is a ponzi peak blow off but we did not see the banking crisis because of all the different
[3:25:32.280 --> 3:25:39.240]  stimulus funds and then we got the household personal protection program you know the ppp's
[3:25:39.240 --> 3:25:44.520]  i might not have gotten the acronym correct but the ppp i got denied that at my bank they said oh
[3:25:44.520 --> 3:25:51.480]  no we ran we hit our limit and i said i i'd like my 2000 or 3000 what the hell and they said maybe
[3:25:51.480 --> 3:26:00.280]  next time and i said well you know maybe next time um so you know so we saw payments are going out
[3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:08.200]  uh-huh everything turned crazy everything turned you know gosh that then you had the supply chain
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:16.040]  interrupted with covid cases for workers and then you got the biden uh the biden unemployment
[3:26:16.040 --> 3:26:21.080]  offer if you if you're worried about your work and you're worried about the crisis you can get
[3:26:21.080 --> 3:26:26.520]  unemployment and that was a backdoor way of undermining the supply chain all these different
[3:26:26.520 --> 3:26:31.800]  measures we're under attack from five sides kate we're not going to get out of this without a food
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:38.120]  crisis and and riots so oh we'll definitely talk about that because food shortages are definitely
[3:26:38.120 --> 3:26:43.640]  coming there's no question and so there there might have been some subterranean payments being made
[3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:51.560]  through the use of crypto possible okay i you really you're yeah you moved you switch lanes fast
[3:26:51.560 --> 3:27:00.200]  there um i've got it on good authority from a pacific rim source a pacific rim source
[3:27:00.760 --> 3:27:09.320]  and he told me there is some intergenerational restitution going on and they wanted to do it
[3:27:09.320 --> 3:27:17.880]  but it's it's trillions it's hundreds of billions and trillions and i said what is this for this is
[3:27:17.880 --> 3:27:25.480]  a conversation just after christmas a client of mine and he's he's a fund manager uh he manages uh
[3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:30.680]  big funds in the pacific rim he didn't want me to reveal much in the way of details regarding that
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:37.560]  but he said i'll give you one example in the 19th century there was a lot of construction
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:46.760]  of railroads in the west our west california etc the western states and we use chinese slave labor
[3:27:47.720 --> 3:27:52.360]  and we put them in housing we gave them a minimum amount of food to eat water
[3:27:53.080 --> 3:27:58.040]  we didn't treat them very well and and i don't have a lot of detail i'm not an expert in that part
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:03.720]  of history except i do know that we had a lot of chinese workers and some of them were slaves
[3:28:03.720 --> 3:28:11.000]  and we never properly paid for that well apparently there's been some decisions that the next couple
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:18.440]  of decades are going to see restitution and tremendous shift of wealth from our part in
[3:28:18.440 --> 3:28:24.520]  the west to their part in the east and a lot of these funds are being moved subterraneanly
[3:28:24.520 --> 3:28:32.120]  subterraneously uh by means of crypto bitcoin and not just bitcoin not just bitcoin but that's
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:39.160]  one reason bitcoin went up a lot in value and they do this because they don't want the wall
[3:28:39.160 --> 3:28:45.800]  street hands at the table i call them the ferryman they don't want the ferryman

[3:31:12.600 --> 3:31:18.200]  anybody that speaks out against their lives but because of so many scientists and engineers
[3:31:18.200 --> 3:31:24.280]  and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers now their whole project is falling
[3:31:24.280 --> 3:31:31.400]  apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover and so it's
[3:31:31.400 --> 3:31:36.440]  pulling back the curtain now more than ever the problem is some globalist controlled areas are
[3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:42.360]  not going to give up on their takeover like canada where they've now declared a civil emergency
[3:31:42.360 --> 3:31:47.640]  and martial law in ontario and other areas of the world are following suit like australia

[3:32:57.960 --> 3:33:06.760]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:33:10.120 --> 3:33:15.720]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host my guest is dr jim willie uh
[3:33:15.720 --> 3:33:22.440]  golden hyphen jackass.com uh the hat trick newsletter you must get a copy of this um
[3:33:22.440 --> 3:33:26.840]  dr jim willie you were talking a little bit about fairy men we were talking about china
[3:33:26.840 --> 3:33:32.040]  i know that they had a dam break um and uh they talked about it in the news just a little but it
[3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:36.920]  created some problems maybe some shortages and some things that fed a lot of people is a very
[3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:42.120]  very big dam and then also we have this food shortage coming so i want you to comment on
[3:33:42.120 --> 3:33:48.440]  so many things plus crypto so how you're gonna wrap all that in i don't know um but i you were
[3:33:48.440 --> 3:33:52.360]  just talking about the fairy men and we had to go to break so if you want to pick it up from there
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:34:01.160]  that'd be great a lot of money i'm talking about hundreds of billions and trillions low trillions
[3:34:02.200 --> 3:34:09.560]  have been transferred from our part of the world in the west to the pacific rim to china and to
[3:34:09.560 --> 3:34:16.680]  asia and they're using bitcoin and they're not just using bitcoin but they wanted to avoid the
[3:34:16.680 --> 3:34:22.040]  security and exchange commission and the wall street bankers they want to avoid the wall street
[3:34:22.040 --> 3:34:29.560]  hands i call them the fairy men the fairy men want to see and control the movement and they say
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:37.960]  we want to assure the security but they usually want 5 10 15 20 percent of the funds in movement
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:44.680]  so the asians and the westerners agreed to move it by means of bitcoin and not just bitcoin
[3:34:44.680 --> 3:34:53.560]  they're actually moving many many billions of dollars in tiny crypto tokens just imagine
[3:34:53.560 --> 3:35:03.400]  a crypto token that's um valued at 100 to the penny well one could rise 100 100 fold and it's
[3:35:03.400 --> 3:35:10.120]  still be a penny and not be on the sec radar security and exchange commission okay there's
[3:35:10.120 --> 3:35:17.640]  something big going on at the three gorges dam china is threatening our country with nuclear
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:24.440]  missiles of small types off the west coast in container vessels it's not on the news not
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:33.240]  much news is on the news and we're threatening the three gorges dam mark me that's why you're here
[3:35:33.240 --> 3:35:40.760]  jim yeah not much news on the news if the news had value they would charge for it but it's free so
[3:35:40.760 --> 3:35:46.680]  it's not it's propaganda i learned that a long time ago anyway the three gorges game i have a
[3:35:46.680 --> 3:35:52.760]  tickly nose i apologize i've always had a tickly nose um even though i cut my nose here okay so
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:36:02.920]  three gorges gam is in china and there are 300 million people living downstream and there are
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:12.920]  many many farms in agricultural corporate businesses downstream also the three gorges dam has something
[3:36:12.920 --> 3:36:21.960]  like a dozen or 15 different power plants that are operated by the hydroelectric source of energy
[3:36:22.920 --> 3:36:30.280]  they use some of that to do bitcoin mining they also have a gigantic center that i don't want to
[3:36:30.280 --> 3:36:36.520]  talk about much at all but it's for child trafficking okay let's just leave that alone um the point is
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:44.200]  that the three gorges dam is a target it's a strategic target and the united states whatever
[3:36:44.760 --> 3:36:50.120]  you want to call them the space force the military the white hats the white alliance
[3:36:50.120 --> 3:36:56.920]  they're targeting the three gorges dam and i think they're doing it with a water frequency
[3:36:56.920 --> 3:37:05.320]  harp type weapon it agitates the water to such a point that it breaks and causes cracks in the dam
[3:37:06.280 --> 3:37:12.360]  now we all know about the hurricane harp we know about the the uh earthquake harp but most people
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:21.640]  don't know about the water agitation harp it stirs up water and breaks dams i do not believe
[3:37:21.640 --> 3:37:31.160]  the three gorges dam is broken i believe it is damaged and it's a warning it's a warning back
[3:37:31.160 --> 3:37:38.280]  off on control through bribery and threat nuclear threat to the united states or else we will break
[3:37:38.280 --> 3:37:46.040]  your dam and you could have a hundred million casualties downstream and destroy your entire
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:52.680]  national food production system so there's a lot going on with the three gorges dam i have a picture
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:59.240]  of it um i think it was about november or december hattrick letter the report my monthly report
[3:37:59.880 --> 3:38:09.160]  and it's a gigantic dam it's it's like three quarters of a mile wide wow wow so how does
[3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:15.560]  ukraine and russia work into this right now today what's going on there in in your analysis
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  real quick that works into this ukraine is the last stand for the cabal
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:30.920]  ukraine is where they've got their multiple criminal activity enterprises operating it's
[3:38:30.920 --> 3:38:41.000]  a failed state and that's perfect for the cabal to run their narcotics trafficking child trafficking
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:47.480]  white woman trafficking with the aid of the united nations by the way uh that was the subject of a
[3:38:47.480 --> 3:38:56.120]  rachel weiss movie about 18 20 years ago that i saw uh human organ trafficking this is all activity
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:02.200]  in ukraine all in ukraine not on the news not on the this is what's being halted by the russian
[3:39:02.200 --> 3:39:13.320]  military adrenochrome harvesting centers um testing locations public testing locations for virus
[3:39:13.320 --> 3:39:20.760]  propagation like a mid-sized town away from the capital and they spread a virus to see how quickly
[3:39:20.760 --> 3:39:27.800]  people die okay and the bio labs of course you can't leave out the the bio lab development for
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:37.080]  a you know gain of function development ethnic targeting uh for viruses and they're mostly
[3:39:37.080 --> 3:39:46.360]  funded by the u.s department of defense kate absolutely so russia and china once this is gone
[3:39:48.040 --> 3:39:54.360]  once once russia absorbs ukraine and they probably will what happens with what what's the goal of
[3:39:54.360 --> 3:40:03.160]  russia and china together well or is there a together in the united nations the ukrainian
[3:40:03.160 --> 3:40:12.200]  official borders are the same as the old soviet union so from a united nation's perspective russia
[3:40:12.200 --> 3:40:22.360]  has not invaded ukraine this is almost funny um yeah okay russia and china are big trade partners
[3:40:22.360 --> 3:40:27.960]  remember it was about five years ago they announced the holy grail energy deal it was
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:37.640]  about a 10 12 year contract for 230 billion dollars worth okay that that formalized the
[3:40:37.640 --> 3:40:50.040]  yuan oil gold triangle for shanghai futures contracts because russia was selling oil to china
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:57.320]  and with with respect to shanghai they could take the oil sales and convert it to gold
[3:40:58.680 --> 3:41:05.800]  shanghai was a conversion location for russian oil sold to china converted to gold
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:11.080]  okay that's very important now russia and china are expanding their trade they've
[3:41:11.080 --> 3:41:16.680]  been expanding it all these years but they're also expanding their methods of payment and
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:20.840]  they've announced they're not going to use the dollar anymore uh they're going to use the
[3:41:20.840 --> 3:41:27.240]  cross-border interbank payment system the cips it's going to be competing with swift
[3:41:28.440 --> 3:41:35.640]  okay here's a big big takeaway kate the united states by pretending pretending to be
[3:41:36.520 --> 3:41:43.560]  in control and being bullies uh on the international stage we're trying to declare
[3:41:43.560 --> 3:41:51.480]  that country that country that country you're not going to use the dollar anymore and what
[3:41:51.480 --> 3:42:00.760]  we're essentially doing is creating a critical mass of non-dollar using trade partners like
[3:42:00.760 --> 3:42:09.240]  what i call the eurasian trade zone the eurasian trade zone will come into public eye when they
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:15.800]  capture western europe by that i mean when they begin to make trade deals with western europe
[3:42:16.600 --> 3:42:20.600]  that's going to be an economic capture and here's how it's going to happen
[3:42:21.640 --> 3:42:29.240]  russia will say to germany and france and italy you want russian gas you need to put aside the
[3:42:29.240 --> 3:42:38.120]  united states players and agents in the room and we're going to demand your gold as payment
[3:42:38.120 --> 3:42:43.880]  for the oil and gas we're going to come right back on that note more with dr jim willey don't
[3:42:43.880 --> 3:42:47.320]  go anywhere we're going to talk housing we're going to talk crypto is there something you
[3:42:47.320 --> 3:42:52.520]  should invest in right now we'll be right back i'm kate deli your guest host don't go anywhere this

[3:47:11.560 --> 3:47:15.640]  hi welcome back a big thank you to alex jones for letting me host today i'm kate dally your guest
[3:47:15.640 --> 3:47:20.600]  host from kate dally radio dot com we don't have a lot of time and we need to cover a lot of ground
[3:47:20.600 --> 3:47:27.400]  my guest is uh jim willey from dr jim willey from uh from golden hyphen jackass dot com you
[3:47:27.400 --> 3:47:31.800]  can check out his newsletter and subscribe and there's so much to go over because i want to go
[3:47:31.800 --> 3:47:35.800]  over what if somebody's sitting there listening right now who says i don't know whether to buy a
[3:47:35.800 --> 3:47:39.640]  house right now is it going to keep going up i don't know whether to take my equity out i don't
[3:47:39.640 --> 3:47:45.480]  know whether to keep cash in my house i don't know whether to invest in crypto and uh you were
[3:47:45.480 --> 3:47:50.760]  saying on a previous show you know the banks were not ready yet and so maybe this is why we have
[3:47:50.760 --> 3:47:56.360]  this little reprieve right now but uh there's so much to talk about jim what do you tell somebody
[3:47:56.360 --> 3:48:00.360]  what kind of advice you give somebody not financial advice just advice in general
[3:48:00.360 --> 3:48:08.120]  because people don't know what to do right now with all of this be very careful don't trust your bank
[3:48:09.240 --> 3:48:14.840]  realize that bail ins are a possibility that the big banks are going bankrupt because they're
[3:48:14.840 --> 3:48:23.560]  narcotics money laundering profits are being interdicted away um i like silver i've always
[3:48:23.560 --> 3:48:29.320]  liked silver i'd like it even more now than i did when i started the newsletter uh but there's a
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:36.680]  transformation going on where people had better get in line and learn about digital finance
[3:48:37.480 --> 3:48:45.480]  aka cryptocurrency they better get in line and learn because they don't want to be left behind
[3:48:45.480 --> 3:48:53.560]  i have kind of a saying a maxim that if you're stuck and you remain in the dollar
[3:48:54.520 --> 3:49:00.840]  and in money market and in the stock market and in the bond market you're probably going to lose 30
[3:49:00.840 --> 3:49:09.080]  percent during a conversion that's forced upon you if you move ahead of the crowd or with a growing
[3:49:09.080 --> 3:49:16.680]  part of the crowd into the crypto digital finance world you're probably going to really realize some
[3:49:16.680 --> 3:49:25.720]  rather significant profit and i like xrp because they've enlisted the support of the wall street banks
[3:49:26.840 --> 3:49:31.560]  and the wall street banks are deceiving themselves into thinking they're going to remain in control
[3:49:32.520 --> 3:49:36.200]  in order to continue their fraudulent games but they're going to have to operate
[3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:44.680]  within decentralized rules and transparency rules and operate on that firm blockchain
[3:49:44.680 --> 3:49:52.200]  road so xrp has enlisted the support of wall street and i believe xrp is going to be the
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:50:00.840]  bridge to the future financial system from the dollar which is on which it must the dollar
[3:50:00.840 --> 3:50:11.160]  must move toward the off ramp look at the debt hard to think about sure 30 trillion dollars in debt
[3:50:11.880 --> 3:50:17.000]  we got a four trillion dollar budget five trillion dollar budget half of it is in deficit
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:24.520]  we've got giveaways and look at look at the sabotage we have the strategic oil reserve that
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:31.320]  was directed to china we had the colonial gas pipeline that was turned off they claimed it was
[3:50:31.320 --> 3:50:40.040]  a crypto a crypto event a hacking no that's to implicate and to tarnish crypto now we've got
[3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:49.160]  more oil giveaway to france i believe that the strategic petroleum reserve has been captured
[3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:56.600]  by the white hats okay all of this indicates that the dollar system and the wall street banks
[3:50:56.600 --> 3:51:04.600]  they're insolvent they had to get five trillion dollars in late 2019 to stay afloat the system
[3:51:04.600 --> 3:51:10.760]  is coming apart at the seams i call it the vi more dollar i call it the vi more banking system
[3:51:11.720 --> 3:51:18.600]  i call it vi more stimulus we're in vi more and a lot of people are to say deceived into thinking
[3:51:18.600 --> 3:51:25.720]  well it's not really vi more because it's global and i say it is vi more because of its characteristics
[3:51:25.720 --> 3:51:29.720]  and the fact that it's global means we have a global crisis on our hands
[3:51:31.320 --> 3:51:38.200]  hmm would you keep cash on hand right now i would keep cash on hand i would i would keep silver
[3:51:38.200 --> 3:51:46.360]  rounds silver coins not collector items like you know an old morgan silver dollar like
[3:51:46.360 --> 3:51:53.320]  bullion coins the definition of a bullion coin is under 10 years of age uh keep keep
[3:51:53.320 --> 3:51:59.640]  silver coins available um i mean gold coins are going to be wonderful too but you don't go to the
[3:51:59.640 --> 3:52:05.640]  grocery store with a gold coin you go to a grocery store for food with a silver coin but
[3:52:05.640 --> 3:52:09.880]  we don't know whether the grocery store is going to have any food in it i'm thinking we're going
[3:52:09.880 --> 3:52:17.320]  to see a third to half the shelves empty in a matter of several weeks or a couple months we
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:25.160]  have a very difficult planting season coming up for instance the nato forces sank a ship in the Black
[3:52:25.160 --> 3:52:36.520]  Sea off Crimea Ukraine they sank a fertilizer ship okay wow this is a yeah and it's a rick scares
[3:52:36.520 --> 3:52:44.280]  it's a food war uh there's going to be a lot of i i i got some technical information uh recently
[3:52:45.080 --> 3:52:51.640]  corn requires a lot more fertilizer so farmers are moving to soybean so we're likely to see a
[3:52:51.640 --> 3:52:59.480]  shortage of quite watch you want to do a a a wild bet get some get some september corn futures
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:05.080]  you'll probably see a double price and you could see a 15 fold increase in your
[3:53:05.080 --> 3:53:14.840]  your bet so so buy food right so buy food buy silver maybe have some cash on hand because
[3:53:14.840 --> 3:53:20.680]  there still will be merchants and uh and businesses that will take cash that will rebel against this
[3:53:20.680 --> 3:53:24.840]  and then if you're wanting to buy a house right now do you think this is a good time to get into a
[3:53:24.840 --> 3:53:29.720]  house because a lot of people fear it going up so they want to get it right now before interest
[3:53:29.720 --> 3:53:36.840]  keeps up now um the fed is in a horrible position the federal reserve i call it us fed
[3:53:36.840 --> 3:53:43.640]  because they're on our ground um they're in a terrible spot they must raise the interest rates
[3:53:43.640 --> 3:53:51.080]  but they cannot we cannot have the dollar and the treasury bonds operating where they are
[3:53:51.080 --> 3:53:58.040]  at current level in the forex and current bond yield we cannot have it operate where it is
[3:53:58.040 --> 3:54:05.880]  for long because we've got a differential of like 18 to 20 percent inflation and a 1 or 2
[3:54:05.880 --> 3:54:13.880]  percent bond yield you can't have that kind of differential that is like a hyper fire hose
[3:54:14.920 --> 3:54:21.320]  of vaimar funding you can't do that you you're you're discouraging the savers i've got some
[3:54:21.320 --> 3:54:27.400]  clients in south florida and they they don't know what to do where do i get any yield in order to
[3:54:27.400 --> 3:54:32.600]  have income to live on well you can't get it from a bond you can't get it from the treasury bond
[3:54:32.600 --> 3:54:38.600]  and what they're doing is they're getting tempted into junk bonds but the junk bonds even though
[3:54:38.600 --> 3:54:45.400]  they're paying a bigger interest rate they can go down remarkably in value in principal value
[3:54:46.120 --> 3:54:51.960]  if the situation gets worse and then you have a risk of default on the junk bond we've got a
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:58.600]  spread right now between let me see if i get right in the camera here the spread between the treasury
[3:54:58.600 --> 3:55:05.480]  bond long-term yield and the junk bond yield it's getting big it's getting big and it's usually
[3:55:06.040 --> 3:55:13.320]  a big loud alarm signal so we've got the alarm signal and we're just getting multiple alarm
[3:55:13.320 --> 3:55:19.800]  signals we had alarm signals back in 2019 remember with the the repo bond window repurchase of
[3:55:19.800 --> 3:55:26.920]  treasury we're going from one alarm to the next to the next and now they're all sounding together
[3:55:26.920 --> 3:55:33.960]  because the repo market is back repo market problem is back i've got a one client who told me of a
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:42.680]  friend who had a 38 000 certified check with bank of america he deposited it they put it in the bank
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:53.560]  and they did not put it in his account wow ouch ouch oh no uh it's not looking good it's not looking
[3:55:53.560 --> 3:55:57.880]  good and i know a lot of people are are are panicking but i don't know if this is a good time to keep
[3:55:57.880 --> 3:56:02.600]  your money in the stock market i know we only have about a minute 45 seconds uh what would you tell
[3:56:02.600 --> 3:56:11.400]  people to do other than what we've talked about anything else get food legitimate silver exchange
[3:56:11.400 --> 3:56:21.320]  traded fund okay silver okay i like silver silver is going to survive what happened to nickel i think
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:27.240]  it went up i'm not sure i think it tripled or quadrupled in price nickel what happened to nickel
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:37.160]  is going to happen to silver you have to take signals as as real it's a signal of something
[3:56:37.160 --> 3:56:46.360]  that's going to happen to its related financial types uh okay i noticed that three years ago the
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:55.480]  triple a general electric corporate bond lost its triple a that was a signal you got to pay
[3:56:55.480 --> 3:57:00.760]  attention to signals if you don't you're going to miss the main event you're going to get run over
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:05.160]  okay these banks are in trouble i think mortgages are going to be in trouble because interest rates
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:11.880]  might move higher because of treasury bond earthquake events
[3:57:13.320 --> 3:57:20.040]  ooh interesting i wish we were out of time and and also um job loss because of the shortages
[3:57:20.040 --> 3:57:25.240]  because of what's happening too will people be able to pay their mortgages uh dr jim willy thank you
