[00:00.000 --> 00:26.200]  Info wars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.200 --> 00:31.680]  The two-party system in America that we have today is a result of the Civil War.
[00:31.680 --> 00:37.680]  The Republican Party stood to abolish slavery, and the Democrat Party stood to abolish the
[00:37.680 --> 00:38.920]  Republic.
[00:38.920 --> 00:45.240]  For years after the Civil War, the Democrat Party created Ku Klux Klan, killed black political
[00:45.240 --> 00:51.240]  leaders, kidnapped heads of families, and leaders of churches and community groups.
[00:51.240 --> 00:57.480]  In 1870, John Stevens, a Republican state senator who advocated for the rights of African
[00:57.480 --> 01:03.600]  Americans, was murdered in the Caswell County Courthouse by the Ku Klux Klan as part of
[01:03.600 --> 01:07.960]  a terror campaign being carried out by the Democrat Party.
[01:07.960 --> 01:13.400]  By the end of the century, the Democrat Party helped foster several radical left pro-communist
[01:13.400 --> 01:19.280]  groups such as the National Labor Union, the Revolutionary Socialist Labor Party, and the
[01:19.280 --> 01:21.200]  Social Democratic Party.
[01:21.200 --> 01:27.800]  In the 1900s, the Democrat Party's new radical left began killing members of law enforcement
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.000]  and government officials in several major U.S. cities, which culminated in 1920 when
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.840]  U.S. Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer ordered a series of raids that targeted these
[01:39.840 --> 01:42.200]  leftist organizations.
[01:42.200 --> 01:47.520]  By the 1940s, the Democrat Party had to go underground with their Communist plans to
[01:47.520 --> 01:49.280]  overthrow America.
[01:49.280 --> 01:51.120]  But this did not last long.
[01:51.120 --> 01:57.760]  The leftist media soon labeled this pro-American movement as McCarthyism and portrayed it as
[01:57.760 --> 01:59.600]  un-American.
[01:59.600 --> 02:05.160]  During the early 1970s, with the support of pop culture media, the Democrat Party's
[02:05.160 --> 02:11.640]  weather underground started riots, murdered police, and bombed government buildings,
[02:11.640 --> 02:14.680]  including the United States Capitol Building.
[02:14.680 --> 02:21.040]  And today, the Democrat Party's anti-American Communist crusade has grown into an unstoppable
[02:21.040 --> 02:28.480]  force with the support of Hollywood, the big banks, corporations, and private think tanks,
[02:28.480 --> 02:31.800]  as well as the majority of the Republican Party.
[02:31.800 --> 02:39.000]  Today, the Democrat Party's radical BLM and ANTIFA are able to murder Americans in cold
[02:39.000 --> 02:46.320]  blood and burn down cities while law enforcement defends them and the average American supports
[02:46.320 --> 02:47.480]  them.
[02:47.480 --> 02:52.840]  What we are witnessing today is the final act of the destruction of individual liberty,
[02:52.840 --> 02:55.720]  natural law, and the Bill of Rights.
[02:55.720 --> 03:01.760]  And what follows will be a tyranny unlike anything we have ever seen in recorded history,
[03:01.760 --> 03:05.400]  because the average American no longer cares about freedom.
[03:05.400 --> 03:11.000]  Today's liberal Democrats are all on board with illegal wars for profit, imprisoning
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.960]  their opposition, and exploiting the most innocent among us, our children.
[03:16.960 --> 03:22.920]  The American people have become fat, drunk, and stupid, with swollen egos incapable of
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.600]  seeing even the most minute flaw in their own character.
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.960]  The American people have become so dumbed down that all the enemy has to do is lie.
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.040]  And no matter how radical the lie is, they will believe it.
[03:38.040 --> 03:42.960]  Some of us would gladly die for freedom, thousands already have.
[03:42.960 --> 03:47.480]  But unfortunately, most of us will do nothing but comply.
[03:47.480 --> 03:53.800]  The biggest cowards in all of human history can be found today in America, because with
[03:53.800 --> 03:59.080]  only the slightest bit of courage, we could turn this all around.
[03:59.080 --> 04:25.440]  Coming for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[04:25.440 --> 04:33.000]  The destruction and terror that they bring to this country will not cease to exist.
[04:33.000 --> 04:40.960]  And we'll look back someday if the Democrats' destruction of America continues, and we'll
[04:40.960 --> 04:45.240]  live in a third world hellhole, and we'll see the swallow and everything that comes
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.840]  with it, and we'll sit back and we'll look at ourselves, and we won't say, what happened?
[04:48.840 --> 04:49.840]  How did this happen?
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.040]  We'll know exactly how it happened, because we know exactly how it's happening right
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.440]  now, with Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrat thieves and criminals.
[05:00.440 --> 05:29.400]  The Internet and talk radio are on fire, with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[05:29.400 --> 05:31.880]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[05:31.880 --> 05:37.000]  So now, the fight's out in the open, they're making their move, because they know they're
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  behind schedule.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  We're going to win this thing.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.360]  God's watching, the children counting on us, and I just want to thank the viewers and
[05:42.360 --> 05:45.800]  listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, because
[05:45.800 --> 05:48.160]  without you, Infowars would not be here.
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.560]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Infowar, and you are the
[05:52.560 --> 05:54.840]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[05:54.840 --> 06:21.040]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done, and ask you now to redouble
[06:21.040 --> 06:29.880]  with you on this Tuesday, June 14th, 2022, Flag Day.
[06:29.880 --> 06:35.520]  No, not your gay flag, how about the American flag?
[06:35.520 --> 06:42.760]  As we are just 147 days away from the historic midterms, that almost certainly will determine
[06:42.760 --> 06:45.320]  the fate of the future of this country.
[06:45.320 --> 06:53.120]  More Democrat Party rule means more destruction, more poverty, more lies, more deception, more
[06:53.120 --> 06:58.840]  war, or we can start to reverse that trend by getting a Republican-controlled Congress
[06:58.840 --> 07:08.200]  to try to mitigate the damage being done intentionally right now by the Biden regime.
[07:08.200 --> 07:13.760]  And I do have the latest news here in front of me on what the Biden regime is up to.
[07:13.760 --> 07:18.920]  We have new record high increases in the producer price index.
[07:18.920 --> 07:23.800]  That just means the cost of producing goods is skyrocketing.
[07:23.800 --> 07:29.520]  And so, of course, in turn, the consumer price index also has record high gains.
[07:29.520 --> 07:31.000]  It's all by design, folks.
[07:31.000 --> 07:35.200]  Let's not act like this is a uncontrollable circumstance.
[07:35.200 --> 07:38.640]  Let's not act like this is something nobody saw coming.
[07:38.640 --> 07:39.640]  Everybody saw it coming.
[07:39.640 --> 07:46.040]  It was a presidential Democrat Party policy, and it was actually put well to me by a friend
[07:46.040 --> 07:52.000]  of mine the other day, basically insinuating I should change my rhetoric, or that's kind
[07:52.000 --> 07:53.000]  of how I took it.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.720]  It's not how it was proposed to me, but it's how I took it.
[07:55.720 --> 08:00.080]  Folks, you're not seeing inflate...
[08:00.080 --> 08:02.040]  Well, you are obviously seeing inflation.
[08:02.040 --> 08:05.400]  You are obviously seeing a recession, maybe even a depression.
[08:05.400 --> 08:08.600]  It's all these different things we can talk about.
[08:08.600 --> 08:17.800]  But the better understanding of it would be to understand that it's actually rationing
[08:17.800 --> 08:21.200]  already taking place on a global stage.
[08:21.200 --> 08:27.320]  The U.S. has been too fat and happy, and so our leaders are now rationing us back down
[08:27.320 --> 08:28.680]  into poverty.
[08:28.680 --> 08:34.040]  We have too big of a middle class, so they're rationing that middle class down into lower
[08:34.040 --> 08:35.440]  classes.
[08:35.440 --> 08:37.200]  That's what's going on.
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.080]  When you're getting your energy shut off, when your food prices are skyrocketing and
[08:42.080 --> 08:46.320]  everything else, you're just learning to deal with rationing.
[08:46.320 --> 08:53.280]  You're just learning to deal with, you no longer are going to have ease of access and
[08:53.280 --> 08:55.400]  excess in this country.
[08:55.400 --> 09:00.760]  No, you're going to be trained to be poor and hungry.
[09:00.760 --> 09:06.180]  That's the new rationing of the new world order that the Democrats and Biden are bringing
[09:06.180 --> 09:07.180]  to us.
[09:07.180 --> 09:11.920]  You can sit here and say, hey, it's a recession, hey, it's record high inflation, it's record
[09:11.920 --> 09:14.480]  high consumer price index, producer price index.
[09:14.480 --> 09:18.960]  You can actually look at all the data and the numbers and the variables and all the
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.360]  stuff, and it's very comprehensible.
[09:22.360 --> 09:23.360]  You're just living it.
[09:23.360 --> 09:24.800]  You don't even need to look at the numbers.
[09:24.800 --> 09:29.160]  You're living double your energy prices, double your price at the pump, double your
[09:29.160 --> 09:31.760]  grocery bill.
[09:31.760 --> 09:41.200]  You're being taught all by design that no more, no more abundance, no more excess, no
[09:41.200 --> 09:48.040]  more bountiful harvests, you're done, you're done, America, you're done.
[09:48.040 --> 09:54.560]  And Biden told you all of this, that he would do all of this before he got into office,
[09:54.560 --> 10:00.960]  and it's the Democrat Party officially signed on to the globalist new world order, World
[10:00.960 --> 10:08.240]  Economic Forum, Bilderberg Group, World Health Organization, global government that uses
[10:08.240 --> 10:15.640]  manmade climate change as their number one cause to cease human activity on this planet.
[10:15.640 --> 10:21.640]  So you haven't, you're AC running all day, you haven't four flat screens in your house,
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.960]  you haven't a refrigerator in your kitchen full, and a refrigerator in your basement
[10:25.960 --> 10:32.000]  full, and a refrigerator in your garage full, or a deep freezer full, two cars in the garage,
[10:32.000 --> 10:37.520]  one outside for junior, a pool in the back, all that stuff, all the American life, the
[10:37.520 --> 10:42.240]  American way of life, dead.
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.800]  You've had too much, cockroach.
[10:46.800 --> 10:50.480]  That's the attitude of the World Economic Forum.
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.000]  That's the attitude of the World Health Organization.
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.120]  That's the attitude of our political leaders.
[10:55.120 --> 10:59.760]  And they're just so out of touch with reality, there's almost this gamemanship that goes
[10:59.760 --> 11:08.040]  on in DC with the DC elites, when they go meet with other world leaders, they brag.
[11:08.040 --> 11:11.000]  They brag about how they've gotten America to heal.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.280]  They brag about how they've shut off our energy.
[11:14.280 --> 11:19.560]  They show up to these global events, and they brag about how they're crushing the American
[11:19.560 --> 11:27.000]  people, because they think that's virtuous, because America has had it so good for so
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.600]  long, such prosperity, such ease of access, such abundance, that the world hated us for
[11:34.600 --> 11:35.600]  it.
[11:35.600 --> 11:39.720]  And so now our leaders say, well, we'll crush the American people, will you like us then?
[11:39.720 --> 11:41.720]  Will you respect us then?
[11:41.720 --> 11:43.800]  Look, look at us.
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.480]  We've doubled their gas prices, we've doubled their grocery prices, we've doubled their
[11:47.480 --> 11:48.480]  energy prices.
[11:48.480 --> 11:55.000]  See, we're crushing America, we're crushing our people, and they go and brag at these
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.080]  international consortiums about how they're crushing the American people, because it's
[11:59.080 --> 12:06.400]  so bad what we do for climate change, oh, except the U.S. is actually probably the most
[12:06.400 --> 12:11.320]  green industrial nation on the planet, it's not even close.
[12:11.320 --> 12:15.000]  But that's not even the point.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.840]  That's just this little game that the D.C. elite play that they don't tell you about,
[12:20.840 --> 12:25.240]  so that they can go to these international groups and brag about how they've crushed
[12:25.240 --> 12:27.960]  the American people.
[12:27.960 --> 12:32.800]  But that's what's so odd about it, is Joe Biden campaigns with his five campaign events,
[12:32.800 --> 12:40.120]  you could fit 10 campaigns in one large automobile, one extended cab automobile can have 10 Biden
[12:40.120 --> 12:41.880]  rallies in it.
[12:41.880 --> 12:45.920]  But no, he campaigns, he goes up to people, he says, we're ending fossil fuels, we're
[12:45.920 --> 12:51.160]  going to take the guns, like he campaigns on all of it, oh, we're going to raise taxes,
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.280]  shut down the energy, and then all of it happens and people shake their heads, they can't even
[12:56.280 --> 12:57.280]  believe it.
[12:57.280 --> 13:04.240]  I mean, Biden told you he would do all this.
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.080]  So I've got a stack of that news, by the way, another food processing plant burned to the
[13:09.080 --> 13:14.920]  ground, other food processing plants in California are being closed because they're being priced
[13:14.920 --> 13:17.880]  out of existence by the Democrats in California.
[13:17.880 --> 13:18.880]  So they don't even hide it.
[13:18.880 --> 13:23.640]  Smithfield Foods plant in California, they say, yeah, we're shutting down, Media says,
[13:23.640 --> 13:27.720]  well, this is one of the biggest food manufacturing plants in California, why are you shutting
[13:27.720 --> 13:28.720]  down?
[13:28.720 --> 13:33.760]  He says, can't afford to work here, can't afford to, can't afford to exist in California.
[13:33.760 --> 13:37.280]  We're being taxed out the wazoo can't afford to produce food anymore, so we're closing
[13:37.280 --> 13:38.780]  our doors.
[13:38.780 --> 13:39.780]  How does that work out?
[13:39.780 --> 13:43.080]  But see, again, the Democrats applaud that, they think that's good.
[13:43.080 --> 13:49.280]  Hey, less consumers, hey, hey, less carbon emissions, that's good, shut down the economy,
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.760]  shut down the manufacturing, that's a good thing, according to Democrats.
[13:52.760 --> 13:54.480]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up, folks.
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.320]  These people are completely out of reality, they're lost in a world that doesn't exist,
[14:00.320 --> 14:06.320]  they're driven by hatred and lust for power, and we're all just the victims of it.
[14:06.320 --> 14:13.200]  And why we're still putting up with the Democrat Party in the year 2022 in this country is absurd.
[14:13.200 --> 14:21.160]  This scourge, the Democrat Party, this scourge, this cancer, this demon should have been eradicated
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.240]  from America long, long ago.
[14:24.240 --> 14:28.800]  But here we are still dealing with it, and now it's crushing us.
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.040]  Oh, the Democrats started as a terrorist group, I know, that's why they haven't changed to
[14:35.040 --> 14:37.040]  this day.
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.320]  I've got unbelievable news about what's going on in D.C. with the Democrats right now.
[14:41.320 --> 14:49.040]  They're all poised to riot as soon as the Roe vs. Wade decision drops, and they have
[14:49.040 --> 14:55.680]  what they call jail liaisons or jail support because, well, why would you go to a peaceful
[14:55.680 --> 15:01.080]  protest with lawyers and bail bondsmen ready to bail you out of jail?
[15:01.080 --> 15:07.320]  Because they plan on committing crimes, folks, because it's a criminal group, it's a domestic
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.280]  terror group called the Democrat Party that we're still dealing with in this country.
[15:12.280 --> 15:18.040]  It blows my mind that we're still dealing with these groups, but I'll tell you the latest,
[15:18.040 --> 15:20.920]  they even call themselves Shut Down D.C.
[15:20.920 --> 15:24.040]  Oh, does that sound like an insurrection?
[15:24.040 --> 15:26.280]  Shut Down D.C.?
[15:26.280 --> 15:29.080]  That's the name of their group, Shut Down D.C.
[15:29.080 --> 15:30.080]  But you're not allowed.
[15:30.080 --> 15:31.080]  You're a conservative.
[15:31.080 --> 15:32.080]  You're a Christian.
[15:32.080 --> 15:33.080]  You're a Trump voter.
[15:33.080 --> 15:36.080]  You're not allowed to even breathe in D.C.
[15:36.080 --> 15:38.960]  They won't even let you breathe if they continue this pace in five years.
[15:38.960 --> 15:42.080]  They'll just probably just throw you in a jail and just put a bullet in your head.
[15:42.080 --> 15:44.640]  It's a Democrat Party for you.
[15:44.640 --> 15:50.440]  But they get to have their groups called Shut Down D.C. that terrorize Supreme Court justices
[15:50.440 --> 15:55.280]  and try to murder people, and they have lawyers and bail bondsmen that walk around with them
[15:55.280 --> 15:58.160]  in the case where they commit a crime and they get arrested.

[16:12.680 --> 16:18.480]  High quality, storable food is now back in stock, ready to ship to you and your family.
[16:18.480 --> 16:22.360]  We've not sold food for three months because there was a wait.
[16:22.360 --> 16:24.200]  Now there is not a wait.
[16:24.200 --> 16:28.520]  Almost every other storable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food
[16:28.520 --> 16:33.480]  for months if ever, and the prices are exploding.
[16:33.480 --> 16:37.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to protect yourself and your family and not be dependent
[16:37.680 --> 16:38.680]  on the system.
[16:38.680 --> 16:40.680]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[16:58.400 --> 17:05.920]  I'm a humble person, and I want to say that I'm just a man, but I'm not just a man.
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.240]  It's like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, you were
[17:10.240 --> 17:15.560]  made by the creator of the universe, who had a plan for you, who has a destiny for you.
[17:15.560 --> 17:19.680]  That's why the system hates you and fears you, and that's why they hate me.
[17:19.680 --> 17:24.720]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and
[17:24.720 --> 17:26.720]  will and love.
[17:26.720 --> 17:31.600]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[17:31.600 --> 17:36.560]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person,
[17:36.560 --> 17:40.080]  and because you love God and God loves you.
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.200]  And so I signed up for this.
[17:41.200 --> 17:43.760]  I signed up for this fight, and I'm not a victim.
[17:43.760 --> 17:46.680]  I'm an overcomer, but I can't fight this fight without you.
[17:46.680 --> 17:50.440]  And that's why I want you to always remember that I appreciate you, and I thank you, because
[17:50.440 --> 17:52.120]  Info Wars is your fight.
[17:52.120 --> 17:53.200]  Info Wars is your baby.
[17:53.200 --> 17:54.920]  It's the thing you built.
[17:54.920 --> 17:55.920]  We did this together.
[17:55.920 --> 17:57.560]  So God bless you all.
[17:57.560 --> 18:01.040]  Let's keep fighting.
[18:01.040 --> 18:03.320]  Info Wars has made history.
[18:03.320 --> 18:07.400]  You have made history in your support of Info Wars, and one of the biggest tools we've had
[18:07.400 --> 18:12.800]  to circumvent and override the sensors has been patriot, apparel, so we can identify
[18:12.800 --> 18:17.880]  each other so we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com
[18:17.880 --> 18:20.800]  so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[18:20.800 --> 18:24.080]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.840]  designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[18:27.840 --> 18:29.080]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[18:29.080 --> 18:33.240]  They are about to be history, and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your
[18:33.240 --> 18:34.240]  wardrobe.
[18:34.240 --> 18:39.360]  So there's only 15,000 shirts of 60 plus thousand left, and a couple weeks they'll all be gone
[18:39.360 --> 18:40.360]  and they'll be history.
[18:40.360 --> 18:45.240]  We're selling them all at cost at infowarstore.com.
[18:45.240 --> 18:47.080]  So thank you all for your support.
[18:47.080 --> 18:52.440]  Please visit infowarstore.com and get one of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves,
[18:52.440 --> 18:54.640]  ball caps, you name it, while you still can.
[18:54.640 --> 18:56.840]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[18:56.840 --> 18:57.840]  Infowarstore.com.
[18:57.840 --> 19:03.480]  Get our great bag of it here.
[19:03.480 --> 19:07.720]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[19:07.720 --> 19:12.160]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested, above
[19:12.160 --> 19:16.520]  organic, in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from
[19:16.520 --> 19:19.520]  the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists, but really they're just
[19:19.520 --> 19:20.520]  a commune.
[19:20.520 --> 19:23.840]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee, and we've got it, and the farmers
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.000]  don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.880]  and I've been buying it for what, 14 years, and the price has never gone up.
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.560]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more, for pound, and I just
[19:34.560 --> 19:36.760]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[19:36.760 --> 19:40.960]  It's Wake Up America, a Patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally, in fact, I'm
[19:40.960 --> 19:48.240]  not going to tell you a little story, we had like the, okay, you wouldn't believe it.
[19:48.240 --> 19:53.280]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[19:53.280 --> 20:01.160]  fund us and don't want to see it, that's fine.
[20:01.160 --> 20:12.520]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:12.520 --> 20:32.080]  You know, let me do a proper introduction here.
[20:32.080 --> 20:38.520]  Roger Stone is joining me in studio in the next hour, and we'll be discussing all the
[20:38.520 --> 20:47.000]  latest news with Roger, and then he's going to be hosting himself ahead of the fourth
[20:47.000 --> 20:53.400]  hour host today, which is Wayne Allen Root.
[20:53.400 --> 20:57.160]  So let me just do this.
[20:57.160 --> 21:00.880]  Let me get into this stack of news, and I'll start to roll off some of these shocking clips
[21:00.880 --> 21:02.160]  that we have from Democrats.
[21:02.160 --> 21:08.680]  I mean, what Chris Coons said on Fox News, and then what Karine Jean-Pierre was saying
[21:08.680 --> 21:10.760]  yesterday is just unbelievable stuff.
[21:10.760 --> 21:15.280]  Then we'll get into the Democrat terrorism that is, they're allowed to engage in that,
[21:15.280 --> 21:19.280]  but if you're a Trump supporter, you take a breath of fresh air in D.C. or step on a
[21:19.280 --> 21:24.760]  blade of grass, they're going to be looking to arrest you sometime between now and the
[21:24.760 --> 21:27.440]  year 2050, whenever it's convenient for them.
[21:27.440 --> 21:30.440]  I'm not joking about that, by the way.
[21:30.440 --> 21:35.640]  If this charade, this sham of January 6th continues, the Democrats will be arresting
[21:35.640 --> 21:40.160]  people for the next 30 years in connection with January 6th.
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.160]  Of course they will be.
[21:41.160 --> 21:45.600]  Look at what they just did to the leading GOP candidate for governor in Michigan.
[21:45.600 --> 21:47.040]  Oh, he's leading in the polls?
[21:47.040 --> 21:49.280]  Well, let's go arrest him for January 6th.
[21:49.280 --> 21:50.280]  Perfect, perfect.
[21:50.280 --> 21:51.720]  It's what they do.
[21:51.720 --> 21:52.720]  They're terrorists.
[21:52.720 --> 21:53.720]  They're Democrats.
[21:53.720 --> 21:56.760]  Again, why we still deal with this domestic terror group and hate group in this country
[21:56.760 --> 22:00.360]  is just mind blowing.
[22:00.360 --> 22:02.280]  But we do it.
[22:02.280 --> 22:05.760]  We do it for at least one more day.
[22:05.760 --> 22:07.880]  But here's some of the economic news.
[22:07.880 --> 22:14.600]  May producer price index soars to 10.8% as energy costs reach daily record highs.
[22:14.600 --> 22:19.880]  I mean, liberals aren't very smart people, so they don't get it.
[22:19.880 --> 22:23.000]  We need to stop fossil fuels.
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.320]  We need to stop carbon emissions.
[22:26.320 --> 22:27.320]  Oh.
[22:27.320 --> 22:28.320]  Okay.
[22:28.320 --> 22:29.320]  So what do you do?
[22:29.320 --> 22:30.320]  Are you doing American energy?
[22:30.320 --> 22:31.320]  Great.
[22:31.320 --> 22:32.320]  Smart move.
[22:32.320 --> 22:33.320]  What's going to happen?
[22:33.320 --> 22:34.760]  Oh, now gas prices are reaching record highs.
[22:34.760 --> 22:36.320]  Oh, who could have seen that coming?
[22:36.320 --> 22:37.320]  Not a liberal.
[22:37.320 --> 22:38.520]  They're stupid.
[22:38.520 --> 22:41.920]  So oh, now gas prices go up.
[22:41.920 --> 22:45.960]  So if gas prices double, they've actually more than doubled now.
[22:45.960 --> 22:48.400]  They're going to be tripled, actually.
[22:48.400 --> 22:52.080]  Probably in July, gas prices will have tripled under Joe Biden.
[22:52.080 --> 22:56.920]  And I would say also in or by July, you're going to see $10 a gallon gas.
[22:56.920 --> 22:59.280]  We made that prediction right here first.
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.500]  Not that hard of a prediction to make.
[23:03.500 --> 23:09.840]  So what do you think happens to the people that distribute the food and move the food
[23:09.840 --> 23:12.200]  and the goods across the country and the planet?
[23:12.200 --> 23:14.240]  What do you think happens to them?
[23:14.240 --> 23:17.200]  Their prices go up.
[23:17.200 --> 23:21.640]  And when their prices go up, your price goes up.
[23:21.640 --> 23:24.520]  Oh, now you can't afford to live.
[23:24.520 --> 23:25.520]  Wow.
[23:25.520 --> 23:26.520]  No kidding.
[23:26.520 --> 23:27.520]  Duh.
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.680]  That's the whole idea of the Green New Deal.
[23:31.680 --> 23:35.160]  That's the whole idea of the Paris Climate Accord.
[23:35.160 --> 23:37.920]  That's the whole idea of stopping manmade climate change.
[23:37.920 --> 23:40.080]  You don't live anymore.
[23:40.080 --> 23:41.420]  You are the problem.
[23:41.420 --> 23:42.680]  You emit carbon.
[23:42.680 --> 23:44.020]  You drive a car.
[23:44.020 --> 23:45.560]  You have air conditioning.
[23:45.560 --> 23:48.760]  You must be shut down.
[23:48.760 --> 23:52.440]  But again, liberals exist in this odd vacuum where they think that all the stuff they want
[23:52.440 --> 23:55.680]  to apply to their political enemy doesn't apply to them.
[23:55.680 --> 23:57.800]  No, you're still paying more for food.
[23:57.800 --> 23:59.640]  You're still paying more for energy, too.
[23:59.640 --> 24:04.680]  And then they're ticked off and they demand student loan debt relief.
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.480]  What a scam that would be.
[24:08.480 --> 24:12.520]  But they'll do it.
[24:12.520 --> 24:16.520]  They'll do it.
[24:16.520 --> 24:22.360]  Real inflation for the vast majority of Americans is far higher than what's being reported.
[24:22.360 --> 24:28.000]  Steve Cortez breaks down massive 25% increase in necessities like gas, food, and utilities.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.800]  It's more than 25%, folks.
[24:29.800 --> 24:31.640]  It's doubled.
[24:31.640 --> 24:32.960]  It has doubled.
[24:32.960 --> 24:37.760]  I mean, I don't have to look outside my own life.
[24:37.760 --> 24:44.520]  My energy bills to cool my home have not doubled, but 25% is probably where it's at
[24:44.520 --> 24:45.520]  right now.
[24:45.520 --> 24:48.520]  I'd say about 25%.
[24:48.520 --> 24:51.040]  I mean, you can go look at your own bills, probably like me.
[24:51.040 --> 24:52.040]  You have it all online.
[24:52.040 --> 25:03.120]  I can go look, and I can see June 2020, June 2021, June 2022, and I can see that if I'm
[25:03.120 --> 25:12.920]  paying, and it was like, I forget the exact number, it was something like 130 for my electric
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.800]  bill in June 2020.
[25:16.800 --> 25:23.780]  And my last electric bill was like 183 last month.
[25:23.780 --> 25:26.120]  So I mean, you can go look at that for yourself.
[25:26.120 --> 25:27.360]  You're experiencing that for yourself.
[25:27.360 --> 25:28.960]  I don't have to tell you.
[25:28.960 --> 25:31.480]  And now the food processing plant's burning down continues.
[25:31.480 --> 25:33.840]  We've got another one.
[25:33.840 --> 25:40.400]  Multiple crews responding to a fire at food manufacturing facility near Portage, Wapaka
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.400]  County line.
[25:41.400 --> 25:43.840]  This is in Wisconsin.
[25:43.840 --> 25:51.040]  Active food, LLC, manufacturing, massive fire, and they're shutting down their facility
[25:51.040 --> 25:54.720]  for now, and they're going to try to rebuild and get it operational as soon as possible.
[25:54.720 --> 26:01.520]  But another, I mean, what, 30, 40, 50 fires at food plants, food processing plants, manufacturing
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.360]  plants, fertilizer plants, what is going on here?
[26:05.360 --> 26:06.360]  Ask Merrick Garland.
[26:06.360 --> 26:08.680]  He has no idea.
[26:08.680 --> 26:09.680]  No clue.
[26:09.680 --> 26:11.080]  Ask the Department of Homeland Security.
[26:11.080 --> 26:13.200]  They don't have a clue either.
[26:13.200 --> 26:17.720]  So those are just food processing plants burning to the ground that we don't get any answers
[26:17.720 --> 26:18.720]  on.
[26:18.720 --> 26:19.720]  Is that more Democrat terrorism?
[26:19.720 --> 26:20.720]  I don't know.
[26:20.720 --> 26:21.720]  I don't get any answers.
[26:21.720 --> 26:22.720]  Is this a space weapon from China?
[26:22.720 --> 26:23.720]  I don't know.
[26:23.720 --> 26:24.720]  I don't get any answers.
[26:24.720 --> 26:25.720]  I don't get any investigation.
[26:25.720 --> 26:26.720]  I'm just supposed to believe that's normal.
[26:26.720 --> 26:27.960]  But this is the Democrats.
[26:27.960 --> 26:28.960]  We know that.
[26:28.960 --> 26:33.440]  Smithfield Foods siding high cost of operating in California to close pork plant.
[26:33.440 --> 26:39.080]  It's one of the biggest plants in California, and it actually was one of the biggest in
[26:39.080 --> 26:43.920]  the United States even for processing pork, and they're shutting down, and they said,
[26:43.920 --> 26:45.920]  we can't afford to operate in California.
[26:45.920 --> 26:48.080]  Yeah, that's the whole point, folks.
[26:48.080 --> 26:52.040]  Like, I just, I wish people could understand this.
[26:52.040 --> 26:53.200]  I really wish.
[26:53.200 --> 26:54.620]  And I'm not lecturing the audience.
[26:54.620 --> 26:59.600]  Most of you probably understand this, and maybe it's a fool's errand to even try to
[26:59.600 --> 27:03.520]  explain this on the air because liberals and Democrats are either not going to listen or
[27:03.520 --> 27:07.440]  not get it, or maybe they like it.
[27:07.440 --> 27:12.800]  Once you see the entire Democrat economic policy does just this.
[27:12.800 --> 27:15.400]  It prices you out of existence.
[27:15.400 --> 27:16.800]  That's the point.
[27:16.800 --> 27:18.840]  You can't exist anymore.
[27:18.840 --> 27:19.840]  You're bad.
[27:19.840 --> 27:23.560]  You're causing manmade climate change.
[27:23.560 --> 27:30.520]  The whole, the whole idea, the whole idea of build back better, the whole idea of the
[27:30.520 --> 27:36.800]  great reset is to create a new global economy where the individual cannot exist, cannot
[27:36.800 --> 27:39.440]  thrive, cannot prosper.
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.800]  That is the entire purpose.
[27:44.800 --> 27:49.040]  When they say they want to stop manmade climate change, take climate change out of the equation.
[27:49.040 --> 27:50.920]  They want to stop man.
[27:50.920 --> 27:53.800]  They want to stop you.
[27:53.800 --> 27:57.880]  So Smithfield closes their processing plant and says, yeah, I mean, Democrats price us
[27:57.880 --> 27:58.880]  out of existence.
[27:58.880 --> 28:01.520]  What do you want us to do?
[28:01.520 --> 28:07.080]  Really can't operate in California, can't produce food for people.
[28:07.080 --> 28:08.760]  We're shutting down.
[28:08.760 --> 28:14.200]  That is the entire green new deal, Paris climate accord, build back better, great reset in
[28:14.200 --> 28:15.800]  a nutshell.
[28:15.800 --> 28:18.240]  How can people not see this?
[28:18.240 --> 28:20.740]  Or maybe they are seeing this.
[28:20.740 --> 28:22.240]  Women now can't get tampons.
[28:22.240 --> 28:24.240]  There's a tampon shortage in America.
[28:24.240 --> 28:28.840]  We're not sure if this is due to the Biden economy or if this is because liberals are
[28:28.840 --> 28:34.200]  putting tampons in boys bathrooms now, but that's going on.
[28:34.200 --> 28:37.400]  Americans dismayed and furious with Biden administration over soaring inflation.
[28:37.400 --> 28:40.400]  Yeah, you go out and do a man on a street interview, folks.

[28:44.680 --> 28:45.680]  walks of life.
[28:45.680 --> 28:49.640]  In fact, the only ones are white liberals are the only ones that seem to be embracing
[28:49.640 --> 28:52.720]  the collapse of America thanks to themselves and Joe Biden.
[28:52.720 --> 28:56.360]  You ask any rational thinking person, they know Biden is crushing this country.
[28:56.360 --> 28:59.000]  They know it's Democrats.

[29:32.680 --> 29:33.680]  worse.

[31:09.360 --> 31:10.360]  the election.
[31:10.360 --> 31:15.240]  They stole the proof, absolutely cut and dry, there's no denying it.

[31:56.240 --> 31:57.440]  steal the next election.
[31:57.440 --> 32:02.200]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the Internet
[32:02.200 --> 32:06.360]  and mobile technology first came out which is we thought this is going to level the
[32:06.360 --> 32:07.360]  playing field.
[32:07.360 --> 32:09.720]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[32:09.720 --> 32:12.520]  to freely communicate that information.
[32:12.520 --> 32:18.440]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[32:18.440 --> 32:23.480]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[32:23.480 --> 32:28.360]  we want and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[32:28.360 --> 32:35.600]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[32:35.600 --> 32:40.640]  we're having, because of the Internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[32:40.640 --> 32:43.040]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[32:43.040 --> 32:47.520]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them take back
[32:47.520 --> 32:48.520]  their privacy.
[32:48.520 --> 32:53.640]  And so that's really what we're trying to do and so I hope that everybody listening will
[32:53.640 --> 33:00.800]  check us out at boltowireless.com, that's v-o-l-t-a-wireless.com.
[33:00.800 --> 33:17.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:17.400 --> 33:25.240]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[33:25.240 --> 33:34.080]  Remember when a bunch of Trump supporters started a group called Shut Down DC and then they
[33:34.080 --> 33:38.800]  were terrorizing Supreme Court justices and trying to kill them at their houses and doxing
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.040]  their private addresses and then even doxing the addresses of their children's schools
[33:43.040 --> 33:44.480]  so they could terrorize those two.
[33:44.480 --> 33:45.480]  Remember when Trump supporters were doing that?
[33:45.480 --> 33:48.800]  Oh no, I'm sorry, I got confused.
[33:48.800 --> 33:50.440]  That's the Democrats.
[33:50.440 --> 33:52.680]  My bad guys, honest mistake.
[33:52.680 --> 33:53.680]  That's the Democrats.
[33:53.680 --> 33:56.960]  Again, the largest domestic terror group in the history of this country, the Democrats
[33:56.960 --> 33:58.440]  are still at it.
[33:58.440 --> 34:04.520]  Shut Down DC group plans blockade at Supreme Court with jail support on hand.
[34:04.520 --> 34:07.120]  Oh, jail support.
[34:07.120 --> 34:11.680]  Shut Down DC, that's the name of the leftist group that's terrorizing the streets of DC
[34:11.680 --> 34:12.840]  to this day.
[34:12.840 --> 34:19.400]  It's mostly just grumpy, fat, obese women and deranged-looking, skinny, jean-wearing
[34:19.400 --> 34:23.080]  libtards, but they're out there, they're at it.
[34:23.080 --> 34:26.120]  They're threatening Supreme Court justices, they're trying to kill them, they're going
[34:26.120 --> 34:30.240]  to their private addresses, they're banging on the doors of the Supreme Court, and they're
[34:30.240 --> 34:34.240]  just waiting to have a total ride on their hands as soon as the Rovers Wade decision
[34:34.240 --> 34:35.240]  is dropped.
[34:35.240 --> 34:39.820]  So the Democrats are just keeping their terrorists out on the streets as a check against Rovers
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.960]  Wade being overturned, which it would then just go to the states, so I don't know what
[34:43.960 --> 34:49.320]  the big thing here is, I guess Democrats just really love terrorism, and so there you're
[34:49.320 --> 34:50.320]  seeing some of this stuff.
[34:50.320 --> 34:53.560]  So it's Shut Down DC is the group, can you imagine if a group of Trump supporters called
[34:53.560 --> 34:58.200]  themselves Shut Down DC, they'd all be arrested yesterday, but oh, Libs are, they're allowed
[34:58.200 --> 35:05.440]  to do it, Democrats, and they have lawyers and bail bondsmen that travel around with
[35:05.440 --> 35:11.080]  these terrorists because they're expecting to commit crimes and be arrested.
[35:11.080 --> 35:13.040]  Just amazing stuff, isn't it?
[35:13.040 --> 35:17.600]  They are really a well-organized, well-trained, well-oiled terror group.
[35:17.600 --> 35:20.160]  It's the Democrat Party.
[35:20.160 --> 35:23.800]  And Biden completely is in bed with these people.
[35:23.800 --> 35:29.240]  Biden's White House hosted several defund the police activists over the last year visitor
[35:29.240 --> 35:30.400]  logs show.
[35:30.400 --> 35:32.800]  You know, real quickly, I don't know if I have the story on my desk today, but did
[35:32.800 --> 35:35.760]  you know there was another attempted shooting in Texas?
[35:35.760 --> 35:38.640]  It was either this morning or yesterday, I forget.
[35:38.640 --> 35:39.640]  And you know what happened?
[35:39.640 --> 35:42.240]  A policeman stopped him.
[35:42.240 --> 35:45.640]  That's right, but we should defund those police and disarm the citizens.
[35:45.640 --> 35:48.760]  That way we can have mass shootings killing hundreds of people in this country.
[35:48.760 --> 35:50.120]  Democrats would love that.
[35:50.120 --> 35:53.960]  Less people, Democrats love that, they hate people, you know, because they're causing
[35:53.960 --> 35:56.960]  climate change after all, but that's another story.
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.140]  Back to the Democrat terrorists and Duncanville, there it is.
[36:01.140 --> 36:04.080]  So tried to kill kids at a summer camp, policeman with a gun stopped it.
[36:04.080 --> 36:05.080]  Oh, what do you know?
[36:05.080 --> 36:07.200]  A good guy with a gun at the scene stops the shooter.
[36:07.200 --> 36:08.760]  Who could have figured that logic out?
[36:08.760 --> 36:10.120]  Certainly not a Democrat.
[36:10.120 --> 36:11.560]  They still haven't figured it out.
[36:11.560 --> 36:13.920]  It could happen a hundred times they wouldn't figure it out.
[36:13.920 --> 36:14.920]  D.C.
[36:14.920 --> 36:18.920]  Mayor Ups police presence ahead of protests says cities won't live in fear.
[36:18.920 --> 36:19.920]  Oh.
[36:19.920 --> 36:20.920]  Oh.
[36:20.920 --> 36:27.840]  Oh, we're adding security now because Democrat terrorists are outside in Washington, D.C.
[36:27.840 --> 36:32.920]  I see, and now they're admitting that that's the case.
[36:32.920 --> 36:34.720]  I got you.
[36:34.720 --> 36:36.480]  Okay.
[36:36.480 --> 36:40.920]  But let's recall, and this is the New York Times, they're even admitting it, folks.
[36:40.920 --> 36:45.560]  Police told to hold back on Capitol riot response report fines.
[36:45.560 --> 36:46.560]  That's the New York Times.
[36:46.560 --> 36:51.280]  So, oh, Trump calls Pelosi and says, hey, we should have 10,000 National Guard out there
[36:51.280 --> 36:52.280]  on January 6th.
[36:52.280 --> 36:55.160]  Pelosi says, no, thanks.
[36:55.160 --> 37:00.000]  And then it was, I can't remember who it was, it was either maybe Radcliffe or someone else
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.040]  from the Trump administration reached out to the D.C.
[37:02.040 --> 37:05.960]  Mayor and said, hey, we should have added police on the day of January 6th.
[37:05.960 --> 37:08.920]  There's going to be more than a million people in D.C.
[37:08.920 --> 37:10.320]  Mario Bowser said, no, thanks.
[37:10.320 --> 37:15.200]  Actually, we're going to have less police on that day.
[37:15.200 --> 37:17.200]  Amazing.
[37:17.200 --> 37:20.120]  Really incredible stuff there.
[37:20.120 --> 37:22.800]  Back to today's Democrat terrorism.
[37:22.800 --> 37:31.120]  Ruth sent us group hinted at targeting Supreme Court Justice Barrett's children and her church.
[37:31.120 --> 37:36.800]  Well hinting at it wasn't enough for these scumbags, and so they've actually done it
[37:36.800 --> 37:37.800]  now.
[37:37.800 --> 37:43.640]  Pro-choice protesters post-school information on the children of Justice Amy Coney Barrett,
[37:43.640 --> 37:48.840]  and now they're going to show up at her children's schools to terrorize children.
[37:48.840 --> 37:49.840]  Nice.
[37:49.840 --> 37:52.080]  That's a good look, don't you think?
[37:52.080 --> 37:57.320]  That's a good look for the Democrats to show up at schools after a mass shooting happened.
[37:57.320 --> 37:58.320]  Remember that?
[37:58.320 --> 38:01.760]  I think it's a good idea for Democrats to show up and terrorize schools less than a
[38:01.760 --> 38:04.560]  month after a mass shooting.
[38:04.560 --> 38:05.800]  Good idea, Democrats.
[38:05.800 --> 38:06.800]  Keep it up.
[38:06.800 --> 38:09.120]  Go terrorize those kids, libs.
[38:09.120 --> 38:12.800]  Go show the world what a bunch of terrorists you are.
[38:12.800 --> 38:14.040]  Most of us already know it.
[38:14.040 --> 38:16.640]  The rest of us are starting to realize it.
[38:16.640 --> 38:21.520]  So sadly, if your child goes to school with Amy Coney Barrett's kids, expect Democrat
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.320]  terrorists to show up very soon, I would imagine, and they continue to burn pregnancy centers
[38:27.320 --> 38:28.320]  to the ground.
[38:28.320 --> 38:30.800]  It's the liberal summer of rage, after all.
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.200]  Pro-abortion terrorists fire bomb Oregon pregnancy center.
[38:34.200 --> 38:35.200]  What is this?
[38:35.200 --> 38:36.200]  The 10th?
[38:36.200 --> 38:37.800]  10th this month, I think.
[38:37.800 --> 38:42.360]  10 pregnancy centers fire bombed by Democrat terrorists.
[38:42.360 --> 38:45.240]  It's the liberal summer of rage, after all.
[38:45.240 --> 38:47.000]  That's what they do.
[38:47.000 --> 38:48.200]  It's not just pregnancy centers.
[38:48.200 --> 38:49.720]  The liberals are terrorizing.
[38:49.720 --> 38:57.480]  Arsonists with a hammer and flair attack office of GOP lawmaker in Washington state.
[38:57.480 --> 39:05.000]  Two male appearing terrorists attack the office of Washington state rep Andrew Barkus.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.240]  Yesterday morning, smashing windows and lighting the building on fire.
[39:11.240 --> 39:15.280]  Democrats, doing what Democrats do.
[39:15.280 --> 39:16.280]  Terrorism.
[39:16.280 --> 39:21.440]  Those for fumigation, BLM chapter co-founder arrested after hundreds of cockroaches released
[39:21.440 --> 39:22.440]  in New York courthouse.
[39:22.440 --> 39:24.480]  Oh, what's that?
[39:24.480 --> 39:31.040]  One of the BLM chapter founders was in court facing arraignment.
[39:31.040 --> 39:37.960]  So the BLM activists decided they were going to put cockroaches into the courtroom to shut
[39:37.960 --> 39:40.720]  it down, and they did.
[39:40.720 --> 39:41.720]  Democrat terrorism.
[39:41.720 --> 39:47.560]  Antifa members who brutally beat, robbed two Latino marines will get no jail time.
[39:47.560 --> 39:52.800]  All charges dropped by Soros-backed Philadelphia district attorney.
[39:52.800 --> 39:56.760]  Yes, that's why they commit their criminal acts.
[39:56.760 --> 40:04.160]  That's why they can engage in domestic terror without any fear of consequence, because the
[40:04.160 --> 40:06.040]  Democrat terrorists run everything.
[40:06.040 --> 40:07.560]  They run the courts.
[40:07.560 --> 40:08.840]  They run the district attorneys.
[40:08.840 --> 40:09.840]  They run the streets.
[40:09.840 --> 40:11.840]  They run the White House.
[40:11.840 --> 40:12.840]  They're terrorists.
[40:12.840 --> 40:16.880]  But see, some people are starting to realize this, folks, and there's a story in the intercept
[40:16.880 --> 40:18.520]  today.
[40:18.520 --> 40:22.120]  The headline doesn't really do this, but here's the headline for you.
[40:22.120 --> 40:27.880]  Elephant in the Zoom, meltdowns have brought progressive advocacy groups to a standstill
[40:27.880 --> 40:31.200]  at a critical moment in world history.
[40:31.200 --> 40:37.960]  And it's basically how you see all these leftist groups, and it's run by leftists and liberals,
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.320]  but at the top, they're extremists, they're terrorists.
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.240]  And so the moderate and the centrist that might consider itself a liberal is sitting
[40:45.240 --> 40:49.520]  there watching all this, scratching their head like, I didn't know we were just straight
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.640]  up domestic terrorists.
[40:50.640 --> 40:52.600]  I didn't know we were just straight up evil people.
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.560]  I thought we were just bleeding heart liberals that wanted to do what's good for the planet.
[40:56.560 --> 41:02.080]  And they're slowly realizing, no, the people that you call your leaders are actually avowed
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.200]  terrorists and demons.
[41:06.200 --> 41:12.400]  Among Dems more likely to despise the other party, yeah, that's right, college students
[41:12.400 --> 41:18.040]  who would not date someone or support a business to someone or be friends with someone who
[41:18.040 --> 41:19.960]  voted for the opposing presidential candidate.
[41:19.960 --> 41:24.400]  Would you be surprised that it's liberals and Democrats that are filled with hate here?
[41:24.400 --> 41:30.080]  71% of Democrats would not go on a date with a Republican, compared to 31% of Republicans
[41:30.080 --> 41:33.400]  not wanting to go on a date with a Democrat.
[41:33.400 --> 41:39.440]  41% of Democrats would not shop at a business run by a Republican, 7% of Republicans wouldn't
[41:39.440 --> 41:41.520]  shop at a business run by Democrats.
[41:41.520 --> 41:47.440]  37% of Democrats would not be friends with a Republican, whereas only 5% of Republicans
[41:47.440 --> 41:48.720]  would not be friends with the Democrats.
[41:48.720 --> 41:50.400]  Do you see who the real hate group is?
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.920]  Do you see who the real group that lives with hatred and violence in their heart is?
[41:55.920 --> 41:58.280]  It's the left, but you knew that.
[41:58.280 --> 42:04.920]  Hate internal messages show how Twitter employees debating whether to ban libs of TikTok.
[42:04.920 --> 42:11.280]  They don't know what to do because libs of TikTok is not violating any of the rules,
[42:11.280 --> 42:13.880]  but it is showing the Democrat pedophiles.
[42:13.880 --> 42:17.520]  It is putting a spotlight on all the Democrat pedophiles getting access to your kids in
[42:17.520 --> 42:20.040]  schools and so they don't like that happening.
[42:20.040 --> 42:21.840]  So what are they going to do?
[42:21.840 --> 42:26.320]  Are they just going to outright ban libs of TikTok and show that they're engaged in
[42:26.320 --> 42:28.920]  this censorship because see, they don't want that to happen.
[42:28.920 --> 42:33.360]  They don't want people to know they're just outright engaging in censorship, even though
[42:33.360 --> 42:34.600]  we already know it anyway.
[42:34.600 --> 42:36.400]  They pretend like we don't.
[42:36.400 --> 42:39.200]  So that saga will continue.
[42:39.200 --> 42:43.640]  Leaked Twitter chat shows employees saying we successfully deplatformed Trump as they
[42:43.640 --> 42:47.400]  consider deplatforming libs of TikTok.
[42:47.400 --> 42:52.720]  What does every tyrannical authoritarian murderous regime do?
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.840]  They censor their political opposition, they arrest their political opposition, and they
[42:56.840 --> 42:59.560]  disarm the civilians.

[45:03.320 --> 45:07.600]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the Communists?
[45:07.600 --> 45:12.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.360]  organic in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee, and yeah, we buy it from
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.320]  the little farmers that, you know, the media calls Communists, but really, they're just
[45:19.320 --> 45:20.320]  a commune.
[45:20.320 --> 45:23.120]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[45:23.120 --> 45:26.200]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over, so I actually buy this from the
[45:26.200 --> 45:29.560]  Mexican rebels, and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone
[45:29.560 --> 45:30.560]  up.
[45:30.560 --> 45:34.400]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound, and I just
[45:34.400 --> 45:36.560]  think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[45:36.560 --> 45:39.960]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[45:39.960 --> 45:47.960]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story, we had one, you wouldn't believe it.
[45:47.960 --> 45:53.080]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com, and that's how we fund this operation, and if you don't
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.960]  fund us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[45:58.960 --> 46:02.640]  The globalists are making their move, their great reset is here.
[46:02.640 --> 46:06.480]  They're coming for your children, they're coming for the value of your currency, they're
[46:06.480 --> 46:11.880]  coming for your national sovereignty, they're coming for your very bodies with their biomedical
[46:11.880 --> 46:18.240]  tyranny, they're coming for your free speech, they're coming for your privacy, and ladies
[46:18.240 --> 46:23.000]  and gentlemen, they're coming for your right to vote and have your representative in government
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.840]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[46:25.840 --> 46:31.480]  The new film, the seminal film, the most important documentary ever made in my view, 2000 Mules

[46:39.280 --> 46:44.360]  powerful film with other documentaries discounted at infowarstore.com.
[46:44.360 --> 46:47.400]  Everyone needs this DVD in their library to show everyone you know.
[46:47.400 --> 46:51.280]  We have the tools to bring these criminals to justice, if they're planning to run the
[46:51.280 --> 47:00.880]  same scams again, this film can stop them if you take action, infowarstore.com, 2000 Mules.
[47:00.880 --> 47:07.880]  Making a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:07.880 --> 47:19.800]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[47:19.800 --> 47:25.880]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got
[47:25.880 --> 47:26.880]  one.
[47:26.880 --> 47:41.200]  And from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[47:41.200 --> 47:45.640]  Infowars has been inundated in the last week with listeners and viewers asking where is
[47:45.640 --> 47:46.640]  Alex Jones.
[47:46.640 --> 47:52.680]  In fact, while I have been on a business slash vacation trip on the West Coast, I have had
[47:52.680 --> 47:56.120]  a lot of people log up to me and say, Hey, I tried to turn in your stay and her to an
[47:56.120 --> 47:57.120]  employer.
[47:57.120 --> 47:58.120]  We love Owen, but where are you?
[47:58.120 --> 47:59.280]  Why aren't you on air?
[47:59.280 --> 48:02.800]  And the answer is I never take time off.
[48:02.800 --> 48:07.960]  We also have a lot of sponsor opportunities out of the things where it needs a personal
[48:07.960 --> 48:09.880]  touch that I've been involved in.
[48:09.880 --> 48:16.560]  And so the answer is I am taking off part time, at least for the rest of this week.
[48:16.560 --> 48:21.480]  And I'll be back in studio, Lord willing, because nothing's granted in this crazy world
[48:21.480 --> 48:26.680]  back in studio fighting the globalist at point blank range, but I want to thank Troyer,
[48:26.680 --> 48:32.000]  Mike Adams, Christie Lee, and of course, Harrison Smith and others doing a great job holding
[48:32.000 --> 48:33.480]  on the floor while I've been gone.
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.720]  And also want to thank the listeners for being so concerned and asking where is where is Alex
[48:38.720 --> 48:39.720]  Jones.
[48:39.720 --> 48:41.240]  But there's no grand conspiracy here.
[48:41.240 --> 48:44.920]  A lot of people have also asked, Well, there's these huge hearings attacking you and other
[48:44.920 --> 48:50.280]  people going on right now in January six, thinking maybe that I've, you know, been headed to
[48:50.280 --> 48:51.640]  the hills or something.
[48:51.640 --> 48:54.480]  And again, that is not the answer.
[48:54.480 --> 48:57.320]  This has been planned for a long time separately.
[48:57.320 --> 49:03.880]  Look, if I try to respond all day, the January six lies or to CNN's lies with that hit piece
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.200]  they aired last Sunday, I wouldn't have time to be researching all the really important
[49:08.200 --> 49:09.720]  news and things that are unfolding.
[49:09.720 --> 49:14.360]  They are engineering financial collapse, as you know, by design, we predicted it all.
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.320]  This is the great reset.
[49:16.320 --> 49:20.160]  They plan to use inflation to destroy our savings and get us all deeper into debt and
[49:20.160 --> 49:25.320]  to annihilate small businesses, something I'm going to talk about more here in just a moment.
[49:25.320 --> 49:31.640]  But it really is more important to focus on that and the fact that all other than is mainstream
[49:31.640 --> 49:37.680]  and alternative, there are stories everywhere with professors and teachers and so-called
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.000]  clergy saying we should just get used to pedophilia.
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.760]  We should demystify it, desensitize it.
[49:45.760 --> 49:50.800]  They use all these different types of words, decriminalize it, it's one of the big words
[49:50.800 --> 49:52.720]  they use, and just have the public accept it.
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.160]  What an incredible moment we're living in, in the middle of 2022, that these people have
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.240]  come out of their pedophilia closet and are openly saying we want your kids.
[50:01.240 --> 50:02.800]  But that's what this is all about.
[50:02.800 --> 50:08.040]  It's about raping adults and children of our psyches, of our wills, of our spirits, of
[50:08.040 --> 50:09.040]  our bodies.
[50:09.040 --> 50:15.160]  What do you think Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca and J&J with emergency authorization, gene
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.120]  therapy, injections confirmed to cause mass death, heart attacks, blood clots, it is the
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.480]  raping of our bodies and they're getting more lockdowns planned.
[50:27.480 --> 50:31.520]  That said, briefly responding to the CNN special that they promoted for months and finally
[50:31.520 --> 50:34.080]  aired last Sunday, I didn't watch it that night.
[50:34.080 --> 50:40.720]  I ended up watching excerpts of it online today and it is just complete lies, fabrications
[50:40.720 --> 50:43.920]  and twisted information, none of it's true.
[50:43.920 --> 50:47.640]  There are statements in there like Alex Jones said the truth doesn't matter and we're not
[50:47.640 --> 50:48.960]  about truth.
[50:48.960 --> 50:50.760]  That is absolutely asinine.
[50:50.760 --> 50:53.680]  And listen, you don't need to believe me to know that's true.
[50:53.680 --> 51:00.040]  Who has a track record of actively fighting tyranny and actively predicting what is going
[51:00.040 --> 51:04.080]  to come in the near future and even in the long term future?
[51:04.080 --> 51:06.360]  Who is next decade's news today?
[51:06.360 --> 51:08.200]  Who is next year's news today?
[51:08.200 --> 51:10.080]  Who is tomorrow's news today?
[51:10.080 --> 51:11.280]  It's info wars.
[51:11.280 --> 51:18.440]  Our bread and butter, everything we do, everything we stand for is about telling the truth and
[51:18.440 --> 51:22.920]  we do make mistakes and when we make them, we are very happy to own up to them because
[51:22.920 --> 51:25.240]  we want to be credible with the audience.
[51:25.240 --> 51:30.040]  We're not like the corporate media with all the insider leaks from Project Veritas and
[51:30.040 --> 51:35.560]  others exposing the fact that they're lying to the public on purpose while they surveil
[51:35.560 --> 51:40.480]  their competition and while they engage in mass censorship and while they coordinate with
[51:40.480 --> 51:45.920]  government institutions and the Democratic Party illegally to carry that out.
[51:45.920 --> 51:52.000]  And now they're setting up fact checkers in the European Union and in Canada and in other
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.200]  nations which is going to be the model for the US where these government affiliated fact
[51:56.200 --> 52:04.360]  checkers list something as a disinformation outlet and then those individuals can be arrested.
[52:04.360 --> 52:10.760]  Things that they say have lied selectively or put out disinformation can be barred from
[52:10.760 --> 52:11.760]  running.
[52:11.760 --> 52:13.480]  Same thing they tried with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[52:13.480 --> 52:15.720]  So yeah, they're not just stealing elections at the ballot box.
[52:15.720 --> 52:20.240]  They're trying to steal them by blocking what candidates can run and that model is being
[52:20.240 --> 52:24.880]  orchestrated by the ADL, the Southern Parvy Law Center and even NATO that's heavily involved
[52:24.880 --> 52:25.880]  in it.
[52:25.880 --> 52:30.200]  So we know they're blueprint of control, disarm us, bankrupt us, take over our bodies.
[52:30.200 --> 52:32.400]  Say our children belong to them.
[52:32.400 --> 52:36.240]  Say that children can give the age of consent at age seven so that the state can come in
[52:36.240 --> 52:40.480]  and basically be the parent and confuse the children.
[52:40.480 --> 52:46.040]  This is their overall plan and so of course those of the lie, the children of the lie,
[52:46.040 --> 52:50.440]  those that serve the author of lies, Satan are going to say that we're not legitimate,
[52:50.440 --> 52:55.960]  that we're not modified, that we're not real because we are real and we are telling the
[52:55.960 --> 52:56.960]  truth.
[52:56.960 --> 53:00.440]  We are legitimate and the people know it and that's the other good news I wanted to give
[53:00.440 --> 53:02.320]  you right now.
[53:02.320 --> 53:10.000]  I have traveled to multiple states on the West Coast in the last week and I have been
[53:10.000 --> 53:18.560]  mobbed at grocery stores, mobbed on the streets, mobbed at restaurants, mobbed at hotels.
[53:18.560 --> 53:24.440]  I mean mobbed where first five people run up and then 10 people, I've had up to 25 people
[53:24.440 --> 53:30.800]  snapping pictures asking for autographs, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, all saying
[53:30.800 --> 53:34.600]  we know you're right, we know you told the truth, you're a legend, they're not going
[53:34.600 --> 53:37.960]  to stop us, the fact that they attack you makes us know you're for real plus everything
[53:37.960 --> 53:39.880]  you said has come true.
[53:39.880 --> 53:43.880]  I mean it is insane ladies and gentlemen and again I'm not bragging, oh I'm famous, oh
[53:43.880 --> 53:47.800]  I'm cool, I've been through hell, we've been through hell together but the point is I am
[53:47.800 --> 53:52.560]  a barometer or a gauge because most people obviously aren't well known who are patriots
[53:52.560 --> 53:56.480]  so you don't know if somebody else is a patriot or a wake when you walk past them, whether
[53:56.480 --> 54:03.680]  they're old, black, white, young, straight, you know, gay, whatever, it doesn't matter
[54:03.680 --> 54:09.080]  but when you are well known, when you are famous, like I am or infamous, you get to
[54:09.080 --> 54:15.640]  realize and basically do on the scene focus groups and polls and it is incredible.
[54:15.640 --> 54:20.200]  Now the enemy has AI, they're able to grab giant amounts of billions of pieces of data
[54:20.200 --> 54:25.480]  and crunch it and actually see that the whole world has turned against them and Alex Jones
[54:25.480 --> 54:30.600]  is again just one small part of that but a focal point but infowars is a very, very large
[54:30.600 --> 54:31.600]  part of that focal point.
[54:31.600 --> 54:36.080]  Now getting back to small and medium sized businesses, the target of the great reset
[54:36.080 --> 54:42.040]  being told they're not essential, I've talked a lot about this, we have four companies that
[54:42.040 --> 54:46.480]  supply our high quality supplements and the biggest one we've used for ten years they
[54:46.480 --> 54:50.920]  got bought a year and a half ago during the pandemic because obviously most companies
[54:50.920 --> 54:53.960]  couldn't get their supplies anymore, they couldn't pay employees, they had to basically
[54:53.960 --> 54:58.240]  lay people off or shut down or reorganize and then we wondered why the new owners for
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.840]  eight months held on to our money for four of our top products like DNA force and weren't
[55:02.840 --> 55:04.520]  giving them to us.
[55:04.520 --> 55:07.720]  Our contracts that we had to pay half up front, we finally said okay we're taking our money
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.960]  back, you didn't make the product and they said no, you're going to wait till we make
[55:11.960 --> 55:14.240]  it, you're going to give us all the money up front now, you know the contract doesn't
[55:14.240 --> 55:17.720]  have to say it and then we're not going to do business with you after this.
[55:17.720 --> 55:22.600]  Well we did some legal actions and things and got our raw materials and our products
[55:22.600 --> 55:29.880]  and now have a new top lab even better producing it, thank God, but just imagine what's happening
[55:29.880 --> 55:33.680]  to other companies and other individuals and then understand politically they're not just
[55:33.680 --> 55:38.360]  censoring, they're not just surveilling at the business level, it's not just this company,
[55:38.360 --> 55:43.520]  it's been a bunch of companies that we used to use for other things that got bought out
[55:43.520 --> 55:50.040]  and then said sorry, we're not doing business with you anymore like power reviews, that's
[55:50.040 --> 55:51.200]  just the latest example.
[55:51.200 --> 55:55.560]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is the global social credit score where if you don't play
[55:55.560 --> 55:58.800]  a ball with a new world order, they come in and attack you at every level but the good
[55:58.800 --> 56:03.960]  news is humanity's waking up and saying no, I need to sell our products at close to full
[56:03.960 --> 56:08.360]  price to even fund our operation but it's a catch-22, I need to also move the products
[56:08.360 --> 56:13.400]  we do have out of the warehouse and so this is a great deal, the best deal you're going
[56:13.400 --> 56:18.320]  to find anywhere on high-quality immune support and up to 60% off but this sale will only
[56:18.320 --> 56:22.280]  last four, five, six days because the products will sell out.
[56:22.280 --> 56:27.800]  So there's two new sales, the ultimate immune support, 60% off of the immune support system
[56:27.800 --> 56:30.800]  that we have, it's a bunch of concentrated known herbs that boost your immune system
[56:30.800 --> 56:38.160]  in amazing ways, the superchargent, you get that 60% off with X2, 60% off, D3 gummy, 60%
[56:38.160 --> 56:44.000]  off and the whole food multivitamin, 60% off, so that's the ultimate immune support, 60%
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.320]  off when you get all four of those products together, everybody should be taking this,
[56:47.320 --> 56:48.320]  I know I am.
[56:48.320 --> 56:54.320]  Then there's the trifecta immune support at 50% off, the immune support, the X2 and
[56:54.320 --> 56:59.000]  the D3 gummies, all three of those together, 50% off and then a limited supply of X2 is
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.400]  so good for your immune system, the missing link with most people is clean iodine in their
[57:02.400 --> 57:10.240]  body, it is 40% off, back in stock at infowarsstore.com and again without your purchase we cannot

[1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:09.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Press Secretary Kareen Jean-Pierre has been the unmitigated disaster
[1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:11.880]  that we expected her to be.
[1:00:11.880 --> 1:00:16.600]  But when you hire somebody based off their skin color or sexual preference, well we shouldn't
[1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:20.000]  be so surprised when they turn out to be complete morons.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:26.520]  So we've got some just golden clips here, but what an embarrassment of a Press Secretary.
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:32.840]  Here's Kareen Jean-Pierre, I mean folks, no context needed for this, I mean this is a
[1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:39.220]  self-own, listen to how Jean-Pierre tries to justify what's been going on economically
[1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:42.120]  under Joe Biden clip 7.
[1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:47.360]  He has made this his top economic prior as we're talking about inflation, as we're talking
[1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:53.520]  about the economy, like we have to remember where this country was more than a year ago
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.400]  when he walked into office.
[1:00:55.400 --> 1:01:00.680]  The economy was not in a great place, schools were closed, businesses were closed, we didn't
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:07.280]  have a comprehensive COVID strategy and what he ended up doing was meet that moment, pass
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:13.800]  the American Rescue Plan, only Democrats passed that plan, he signed it, it was his plan and
[1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.200]  now we're seeing an economy that's bouncing back.
[1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:20.840]  I mean should I even bother responding to that?
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:26.120]  We remember where the economy was at under Trump, oh we remember pretty much booming
[1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:31.600]  economy unlike we've seen in decades on all metrics and she says oh we have to remember
[1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:37.240]  where the economy was, oh we remember $2 a gallon gas, cheap energy, booming economy,
[1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:45.120]  yeah we remember, but about that American Rescue Plan that she's bragging about so much,
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:51.240]  see how that held water here in clip 6 when Peter Ducey was asking about it.
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:56.360]  We are coming out of the strongest job market in American history and that matters and that
[1:01:56.360 --> 1:02:02.080]  a lot of that is thanks to the American Rescue Plan which only Democrats voted for that, Republicans
[1:02:02.080 --> 1:02:08.640]  did not and it led to this economic boom, this historic economic boom that we're seeing
[1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:09.640]  with jobs.
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.960]  Do you not believe in historic inflation?
[1:02:11.960 --> 1:02:18.760]  No that is not, that is not how we're seeing the American Rescue Plan.
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:26.120]  Where are these historic economic booms, the prices are booming that's for sure, booming
[1:02:26.120 --> 1:02:31.160]  right through the roof, gas per gallon is more than doubled under Biden, your energy
[1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:35.640]  costs to heat or cool your home are up more than 25%, your grocery bill you've probably
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:41.560]  noticed is almost doubled now, where is this historic economic boom, this mythical historic
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:45.880]  economic boom she's talking about, I can't find it anywhere, nobody can but she's still
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:50.040]  bragging about it isn't she and all Peter Ducey had to say was oh you mean record
[1:02:50.040 --> 1:02:57.280]  high inflation, I'm not talking about that, yeah that's definitely happening, so again
[1:02:57.280 --> 1:03:01.120]  I mean this woman is such a joke, she says we have to remember where the economy was
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:07.280]  at under Trump, oh we remember, we remember 401Ks through the roof, stocks through the
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:11.200]  roof, crypto through the roof, people had savings, people were buying assets, buying
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:17.440]  property, making more money than they ever made and then Biden happened and then inflation
[1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:24.680]  and then CPI and then PPI and she says that's a booming economy, that's incredible but
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:30.040]  if you want to see how truly pathetic the press secretary is and I've been telling
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:34.280]  you this is the case, this is the strongest evidence proving it right now, ladies and
[1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:41.680]  gentlemen, Karine Jean-Pierre literally cannot answer questions, she has a notebook in front
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:50.720]  of her with every answer pre-staged, pre-prepared for her to read off of note cards and if the
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:57.040]  answer isn't in her note cards, it goes something like this in clip 5, first what is the White
[1:03:57.040 --> 1:04:00.760]  House, what is the latest update the White House has received on the current and current
[1:04:00.760 --> 1:04:04.840]  formula situation across the country, yeah let me see if I have anything new for you
[1:04:04.840 --> 1:04:22.400]  on that, I think it's been a couple of days since we have been asked that question, okay
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:26.640]  I don't have anything new, I know we made some announcements last week, I just don't
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:31.680]  have them in front of me but if you want to come back and we'll talk through the things
[1:04:31.680 --> 1:04:38.160]  that we have been able to do in the past, yeah they give me pre-prepared answers for
[1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:41.840]  all the questions that you're supposed to ask and I don't have that one in front of
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:46.640]  me and I don't have my pre-prepared response here in my notebook so I can't answer it sorry,
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:50.480]  I only read off this little notebook that I have here and I can't actually have a real
[1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:55.840]  conversation but I'm black and gay, you know I am very black and very gay so you know I'm
[1:04:55.840 --> 1:05:02.120]  up here I'm doing it, a lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands

[1:06:19.520 --> 1:06:28.560]  We're celebrating Donald J. Trump's birthday, Roger Stone, how old is the greatest president
[1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.800]  in my lifetime?
[1:06:31.800 --> 1:06:36.520]  That's an excellent question, I haven't looked at Wikipedia this morning but I did call the
[1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:42.160]  president this morning to wish him a happy birthday and I want to make it clear, I still
[1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:48.320]  think I'm balanced, it turns out to be the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,
[1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:53.680]  does that mean we agree with everything he did, no, does that mean that he wasn't misled
[1:06:53.680 --> 1:07:01.360]  and betrayed by some of the people around him, no, but he did always put America first,
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:08.880]  I think the president's instincts have been extraordinarily solid, he built the most vibrant,
[1:07:08.880 --> 1:07:14.880]  robust economy in American history, I'm not sure what that woman at the White House was
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:25.400]  talking about but let's go through that if we may, the Dow down 876.5 points, a 30,000
[1:07:25.400 --> 1:07:35.880]  drop from the Dow under Donald Trump, the S&P 500 down 21% since January 3rd, Bitcoin
[1:07:35.880 --> 1:07:47.840]  in which many of our supporters have invested down $3,195, a 14% drop in value, the lowest
[1:07:47.840 --> 1:08:01.120]  value since 2020, mortgage rates, a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 5.23% up from 2.96 under
[1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:09.160]  the last year of the Trump administration, a 15 year high, gas prices, where are the
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:15.360]  gas prices $5 because certainly not in South Florida, that's for sure, you're paying six
[1:08:15.360 --> 1:08:22.800]  and a half bucks for a gallon of gas and if you want high test, it's now hit $7, driving
[1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:30.600]  from here to Ocala, Florida to meet Mike Lindell for a terrific rally by Rock the Red on Saturday,
[1:08:30.600 --> 1:08:41.680]  $100 to fill my gas tank, yes Joe, you did that, inflation at 8.6%, the highest since
[1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:49.880]  1981, so Owen, where is the economic recovery, the boom Biden economy that this woman is
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:54.480]  talking about because I'm not seeing it and I don't think the American people are seeing
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:55.480]  it.
[1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:58.560]  Well it's pretty incredible, she gets to go up there and just lie, I mean that's all
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:03.560]  it is, she's just lying and the only person in the press room that's not a Democrat activist
[1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:09.320]  is Peter Ducey and he's barely even able to get a question in or a word in edge wise,
[1:09:09.320 --> 1:09:14.360]  but yeah, I mean it's amazing that the press secretary sits up there saying it's the most
[1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:19.960]  historic boom the economy has ever had, the American economy has ever had, as the American
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:24.520]  citizen is scratching his head saying, wait a second, where is that going on, how am I
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:28.520]  missing out on that, I'm getting crushed, I'm having to dip into my savings, I'm having
[1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:33.800]  to dump my stock portfolio, I'm looking at my retirement and my 401k, it's almost gone,
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:38.400]  where is this booming economy she's talking about, it's got to be insulting for Americans
[1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:41.680]  Roger, I mean that is just insulting for her to say that.
[1:09:41.680 --> 1:09:49.200]  Well Owen, did you ever think that you would miss Jen Pisaki, I mean at least she was able
[1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:56.160]  to lie in a much more fluid way and she, and of course we miss her endless circling back,
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:02.240]  this woman is literally just a dunce, no that's not a racist comment, has nothing to do with
[1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:08.240]  her or with her race or her skin color or her sexual orientation, she's just stupid,
[1:10:08.240 --> 1:10:16.080]  I'd call her stupid if she were a white male, it's embarrassing, but then this entire administration
[1:10:16.080 --> 1:10:22.400]  is embarrassing, terrific stories repeatedly on the Gateway Pundit, Joe doesn't know where
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:29.000]  he is or what day of the week it is, anyone who really believes that he's running the
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:35.800]  country, that he's in charge or that his number two is in charge really is unrealistic about
[1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:39.160]  how things work in Washington these days.
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.800]  Well people should take note, when you hire somebody based off the color of their skin
[1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:48.360]  and their sexual preferences, you're probably going to end up hiring a moron and I'd say
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:54.040]  that Jean Pierre is probably the dumbest press secretary in U.S. history, at least I can't
[1:10:54.040 --> 1:11:00.600]  think of one, Roger, I can't think of a press secretary that I've witnessed that is as moronic
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:06.160]  as Jean Pierre, perhaps not the biggest liar, but they all max out on lying, so she just
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:10.680]  fits the bill there, but boy oh boy, what an embarrassment to sit there and tell the
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:15.880]  American people it's the most historic booming U.S. economy ever as most people are suffering,
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:20.240]  the middle class is shrinking, food processing plants being burned to the ground, grocery
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:26.440]  bills doubling and everything else, I mean it's insulting for the people, Roger, but
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:34.520]  I think the Democrats know that what they're doing is so destructive for their own party
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:38.920]  that they're kind of starting to kind of bite their tongue a little bit, they know maybe
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:43.920]  that they should lose big time in the midterms, I've got an interesting clip I want to play
[1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:48.560]  for you later where the Democrats saying, basically calling for civil war, if Democrats
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:53.120]  don't maintain the House and the Senate, I get your response to that, but I mean, do
[1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:56.760]  you think Democrats are starting to realize, huh, we really have screwed the pooch, we
[1:11:56.760 --> 1:12:01.040]  really have destroyed this country and the people know it's us, no matter the blame games
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:04.000]  we play on Putin or Russia?
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:11.280]  Look, I think their strategy is one of distraction, first there is of course the epic January
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:17.080]  6 charade, they've now postponed the next set of hearings until Thursday, I guess the
[1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:23.440]  ratings weren't too good, they've hired the ABC News producer, James Goldstone, you may
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:30.480]  remember him, he's the guy who spiked the Jeffrey Epstein story at ABC, he's producing
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:37.040]  this made for television extravaganza, so they're hoping that that will distract people
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:43.080]  from gas prices, from food shortages, from epic inflation, from the fact that we are
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:48.840]  shipping 40 billion, and by the way, that's just a down payment, there's another 60 billion
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:57.280]  in the pipeline to Ukraine, so we can't spend $5.7 million to seal our own border, we've
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:02.840]  come to a point in America where fentanyl is more readily available and plentiful than
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.760]  baby formula, thank you Joe Biden.
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:11.560]  Yeah, that's just one story that really kind of gives you the full picture, by the way,
[1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:18.240]  the situation in Ukraine is there's some interesting developments there, Roger, Ukraine's losing
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:23.480]  badly first of all, they keep saying Ukraine's winning, again that's like saying the U.S.
[1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:28.600]  has a booming economy, this is in the Washington Post ladies and gentlemen, the headline is
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:34.520]  Ukraine is running out of ammunition as prospects dim on the battlefield, and then in the story
[1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:41.200]  I'm reading directly here, Russia is firing as many as 50,000 artillery rounds a day into
[1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:47.120]  Ukrainian positions, and the Ukrainians can only hit back with around 5,000 to 6,000 rounds
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:53.200]  a day, he said, how is that possible with all the funding that the U.S. has given to
[1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:57.600]  Ukraine at least $40 billion that they only have 5,000 rounds a day, something doesn't
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:04.000]  add up there folks, and then this one was even more weird to me, Ukraine has now almost
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.360]  completely run out of ammunition for the Soviet era weapons systems that were the mainstay
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:13.880]  of its arsenal, and the Eastern European countries that maintain the same systems have run out
[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:21.000]  of surplus supplies to donate, Ukraine urgently needs to shift to longer range and more sophisticated
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:26.280]  Western systems, but those have only recently been committed and in insufficient quantities
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:32.680]  to match Russia's immense power, so they're using like 50 year old weapons is what they're
[1:14:32.680 --> 1:14:38.440]  claiming, that Ukraine is using 50 year old weapons, how is that even going on, and then
[1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:42.080]  apparently they don't have enough even though the U.S. has sent tens of billions of dollars
[1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:47.360]  over there, and as Rand Paul said over a month ago, all I requested is an amendment to be
[1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:51.280]  included in the final bill that allows for the inspector general to oversee how funds
[1:14:51.280 --> 1:14:55.680]  are spent, anyone who is opposed to this is irresponsible, all the Democrats opposed it,
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:00.960]  I mean, how is this going on, have you ever seen a more, to me this is just the most
[1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:08.480]  blatant money laundering, money theft operation of the hundreds and even thousands that happen
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:13.720]  via our government, this is like the most obvious Roger, a tiny correction, all the
[1:15:13.720 --> 1:15:19.920]  Republicans and all the Democrats opposed any effort to trace where the money was going,
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:25.360]  so Senator Rand Paul, perhaps a handful of patriots in the Senate simply wants to know
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:31.320]  where's the money going, and on a bipartisan basis that is voted down, I think it tells
[1:15:31.320 --> 1:15:37.480]  you everything you need to know, but the Russians must be winning because I'm reading in the
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:43.320]  New York Post that the Ukrainians are kicking the crap out of them, I read it every day,
[1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:48.880]  this is the worst war propaganda since William Randolph Hearst and the Spanish-American
[1:15:48.880 --> 1:16:06.880]  War, that's Roger Stone, this is the Alex Jones show, we'll be right back after this
[1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:23.080]  episode.
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:27.840]  other storeable food distributor is completely out and will not have more food for months
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:31.920]  if ever and the prices are exploding.

[1:16:36.100 --> 1:16:37.100]  on the system.
[1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:39.120]  The time to be self-sufficient is now.

[1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:04.160]  I'm a humble person and I want to say that I'm just a man, but I'm not just a man.
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:08.640]  It's like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, you were
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:14.000]  made by the creator of the universe who had a plan for you, who has a destiny for you.
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:18.080]  That's why the system hates you and fears you and that's why they hate me.
[1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:23.120]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and
[1:17:23.120 --> 1:17:25.120]  will and love.
[1:17:25.120 --> 1:17:30.000]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:35.400]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person,
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:37.880]  because you love God and God loves you.
[1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:39.600]  And so I signed up for this.
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:44.680]  I signed up for this fight and I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer, but I can't fight this fight
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:45.680]  without you.
[1:17:45.680 --> 1:17:49.840]  I want you to always remember that I appreciate you and I thank you because Info Wars is your
[1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:50.840]  fight.
[1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:51.840]  Info Wars is your baby.
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:53.280]  It's the thing you built.
[1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:54.280]  We did this together.
[1:17:54.280 --> 1:17:55.960]  So God bless you all.
[1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:57.880]  Let's keep fighting.
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:18:02.440]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:03.920]  carefully.
[1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:10.760]  The Nestuses have made the most important documentary in U.S. history, 2000 Mules.
[1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:12.320]  That's not hype.
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:13.480]  That's the truth.
[1:18:13.480 --> 1:18:19.120]  The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:20.320]  to do it again.
[1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:25.640]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with

[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:44.040]  year history.

[1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:19.160]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones 76 Roger
[1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:27.200]  76 is how old President Donald Trump is today and boy oh boy I mean just the comparison
[1:20:27.200 --> 1:20:33.320]  of Donald Trump's cognition next to Joe Biden's so I believe is 77 a year older.
[1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:39.480]  Biden is like at a at a score of zero to 100 Biden's cognition is about a nine.
[1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:45.420]  Trump's is about an 89 if not higher and the juxtaposition of that is just incredible.
[1:20:45.420 --> 1:20:49.000]  But Roger I want to kind of finish up we were just discussing Ukraine I want to just finish
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.920]  this up real quick because I've got some other headlines here.
[1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:52.920]  It's amazing.
[1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:59.680]  So like you said the war propaganda Ukraine says troops holding out in Severian Donsk after
[1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:03.600]  last bridge destroyed I may have butchered that that city there but again it's another
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:08.320]  story Ukraine they can't do anything they don't know what to do they're losing the bridges
[1:21:08.320 --> 1:21:13.600]  they're losing the routes in fact the original headline here in the Reuters story was Russian
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:18.680]  forces cut off last route outside of Eastern Ukraine so it's more proof Russia is winning
[1:21:18.680 --> 1:21:26.520]  but now Zelensky says he vows to retake Don bus and Crimea well how is he going to do that
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:31.920]  just exactly I guess he's hoping the U.S. finally intervenes in a larger war but the
[1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:38.280]  Mexican president he sees what's going on Mexico president slams immoral NATO proxy
[1:21:38.280 --> 1:21:43.720]  war in Ukraine and that's really what it is Roger so I mean just just what do you make
[1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:48.660]  of all this war propaganda what sense do you make of it and I mean in your opinion is this
[1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:53.400]  something that America should really be that concerned about look I think you have to go
[1:21:53.400 --> 1:22:01.160]  back to the origins in the entire purpose of this war and when you say this like Tucker
[1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:09.120]  Carlson has like Alex Jones has as I have you have to be expected to be slammed as a
[1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:16.000]  Russian stooge as one of Putin's puppets but the facts are very clear Putin has said
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:24.840]  for well over two years that he objected to Ukraine joining NATO we know for an absolute
[1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:30.960]  fact that in 1994 we signed an agreement with Boris Yeltsin and the Soviets in which we
[1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:38.480]  agreed not to bring Ukraine into the NATO orbit let me translate that for you what Putin
[1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:47.480]  is saying is he does not want offensive missiles pointed at Russia cited sitted in in Ukraine
[1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:53.520]  the silos interesting enough Max Blumenthal the left wing but anti-war journalist reported
[1:22:53.520 --> 1:23:00.160]  this the silos for these missiles have already been built at NATO that means U.S. expense
[1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:06.400]  so he's made it very clear that he's acting defensively yesterday the U.S. Department
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:12.920]  of Defense finally released a document that proves that there are as many as twenty five
[1:23:12.920 --> 1:23:19.920]  bio weapons labs in operating under taxpayer funding actually the document said forty six
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:23.840]  Roger the official document of the Defense Department forty six bio labs I thought it
[1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:30.000]  was Russian propaganda no it was real so I I stand corrected again I hate you scratch
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:34.800]  my back you correct me I correct you we're in this together brother all that that is
[1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:43.600]  entirely true the point I guess I'm making is that this entire notion that Putin wants
[1:23:43.600 --> 1:23:50.960]  to insert a puppet government in Ukraine to restore the faded glory of the once great
[1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:57.880]  Soviet Union is economically unfeasible and it's just incorrect he is acting defensively
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:24:05.000]  and no matter what you read in the U.S. press right now the Ukrainian puppet state popped
[1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:11.880]  up by the United States the money laundering and child sex trafficking capital of the world
[1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:20.360]  and they're losing and they are losing badly president Zelensky has an amazing three point
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:26.680]  six million dollar luxury beach condominium just down the road here in Miami Beach wonder
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:31.720]  how he got that I mean the guy is an actor and you have to admit the casting has been
[1:24:31.720 --> 1:24:38.240]  very well done very well I mean he does play the role of a president extraordinarily well
[1:24:38.240 --> 1:24:45.080]  but nobody thinks he is running anything and the desire to cover up the epic corruption
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:50.320]  of the money laundering that has happened in Ukraine over the last two decades under
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:57.040]  the bushes under the Clintons under the obaidon biden's under the obamas most certainly is
[1:24:57.040 --> 1:25:03.760]  a major major impetus behind this war even the pope is saying NATO in the west has provoked
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:08.040]  Russia into this war and I want to get back to domestic issues but just one more thing
[1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:15.240]  with your vast political experience here I ran in Venezuela signed a 20 year agreement
[1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:20.440]  will confront the U.S. together so I mean I've been talking about this for a while and I don't
[1:25:20.440 --> 1:25:26.160]  see many other people talking about this Roger how since Biden got into office and and his
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:33.600]  foreign policy basically whatever strength the U.S. had on the international stage and
[1:25:33.600 --> 1:25:39.280]  whatever relations the U.S. had that kind of added to that strength it's all it's all
[1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:45.000]  dissipating quickly Roger I mean like overnight I mean people don't understand how the U.S.
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:50.160]  has lost its seat at the table on the world stage how we've been knocked down the totem
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:55.240]  pole so much I mean Russia and China are now coming together and kind of an anti U.S. stance
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:00.720]  India looks like they're kind of more friendly with that alliance than even the U.S. Mexico
[1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:07.480]  Brazil seem to be siding with with Russia on the Ukrainian front as well so I mean all
[1:26:07.480 --> 1:26:11.800]  these different global power structures are kind of turning their back to the U.S. kind
[1:26:11.800 --> 1:26:15.200]  of giving us the cold shoulder kind of saying you know what we don't really want to deal
[1:26:15.200 --> 1:26:18.160]  with you anymore I think the same thing is happening in Saudi Arabia I don't think they
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:23.760]  want to meet with Biden he's a joke why would you even waste your time Roger what what what
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:28.840]  is your take on all of this developments right now in the world stage because it pretty much
[1:26:28.840 --> 1:26:33.280]  is going unreported by the media but I mean the U.S. is quickly going down the totem pole
[1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:40.560]  and fast well I think this is probably Donald Trump's greatest single accomplishment which
[1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:47.320]  is he rebuilt our military and then he created the clear impression around the world that
[1:26:47.320 --> 1:26:54.920]  he was not not unwilling to project American power when he cut off the Iranian arms deal
[1:26:54.920 --> 1:26:59.920]  which all of his advisors told him he could not actually do in other words Mr. President
[1:26:59.920 --> 1:27:04.520]  that was great campaign rhetoric I understand it made for great applause lines during the
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:11.800]  2016 campaign but you can't really do it and he did it it's signaled I think to all of
[1:27:11.800 --> 1:27:20.440]  our allies and our adversaries an unpredictability about Trump that put them at a disadvantage
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:27.800]  Biden's initial move to remove sanctions on the Iranians and to essentially restart the
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:34.680]  Iranian arms deal was a signal to everyone around the world that he would not step up
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:44.320]  in any arena so the Iranians begin raining missiles on Israel the Russians mass on the
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:52.280]  Ukrainian border at that time the Chinese start harassing American flagged ships in the South
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:28:00.480]  China Sea the North Koreans restart their nuclear weapons development program that's because
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:09.240]  Joe Biden exudes weakness lack of resolve is abundantly clear to the Chinese for example
[1:28:09.240 --> 1:28:16.240]  that should they move on Taiwan Joe Biden will do absolutely nothing I mean he might
[1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:22.240]  sponsor a strong resolution in the U.N. should probably get voted down at this point but
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:30.080]  he will take no action whatsoever to defend our allies on in the mainland up army on on
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:37.320]  Taiwan so this is the manifestation of weakness the greatest single attribute of the Trump
[1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:42.880]  administration was the concept that starts under Dwight Eisenhower is particularly true
[1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:49.840]  under Ronald Reagan and is revived by Donald Trump peace through strength that strength
[1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:55.240]  is a deterrent to mischief around the globe that's Roger Stone we'll be right back we
[1:28:55.240 --> 1:29:01.640]  got to take a break the Internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones
[1:29:01.640 --> 1:29:05.960]  was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling
[1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:12.200]  because I knew this was coming I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:17.480]  is going to become more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore
[1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:23.480]  in policy reports and documents it's now out in the open Klaus Schwab said last week that
[1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:31.240]  they rule the earth the Bilderberg group founded Davos group so now the fights out in the open
[1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:34.880]  they're making their move because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win

[1:33:52.440 --> 1:33:58.600]  for you and get your response to it here is a democrat representative on msnbc threatening
[1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:07.160]  civil war if democrats don't maintain congress here in clip 20
[1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:15.560]  should the glp retake congress in the fall what happens to the january 6 committee
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:21.080]  investigation and its findings and what might the glp do or not do with their newly claimed power
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:30.440]  so the january 6 commission would cease to exist the findings will be completely suppressed and
[1:34:30.440 --> 1:34:38.360]  will not be admitted into any further investigations while the glp will be in power they would
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:46.520]  they would impeach president biden as quickly as possible and they will continue to continue
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:54.200]  to find ways to impeach him going forward it would also embolden republicans and the far right
[1:34:54.200 --> 1:35:00.520]  and white nationalists across the country to begin to believe that it is their time to not just
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:05.480]  take power in the house but the senate the white house and state houses across the country and we
[1:35:05.480 --> 1:35:10.840]  got to understand that this is a group that has been radicalized by the great replacement myth
[1:35:10.840 --> 1:35:18.520]  and many other things and have been pushing for violence and pushing for even civil war so that
[1:35:18.520 --> 1:35:24.840]  is what's at stake right now in terms of this election oh okay rogers let me get this straight
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:29.320]  democrats are currently engaged in terrorism at pregnancy centers they fire bombed more than 10
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:33.960]  of them in the last month democrats are currently engaged in terrorism when it comes to supreme
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:38.680]  court justices threatening their lives attempting to kill them democrats are literally running around
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:44.440]  dc right now with the group called shut down dc with what they call jail liaisons uh because
[1:35:44.440 --> 1:35:49.480]  they're planning on committing crimes so they have lawyers and bail bondsmen's running around with them
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:56.680]  in case they may get arrested by their friends in the police force in dc oh but roger oh it's
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:02.520]  it's trump supporters it's conservatives that are the problem if we win an election i mean this is
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:08.040]  just it's such a load of bull and then he says oh the great replacement theory oh roger i'm sorry
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:12.920]  i didn't just watch a video of 20 000 illegal immigrants coming across our border i didn't
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:17.480]  just see three million illegal immigrants come across the border in 2021 i mean i might i
[1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:26.680]  must be seeing things roger well as usual jamal has everything exactly backwards uh so yes if the
[1:36:26.680 --> 1:36:32.200]  republicans win the house there probably will be impeachment proceedings against joe biden
[1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:37.880]  his dereliction of duty on our southern border certainly grounds for impeachment there's
[1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:44.440]  more than enough evidence in hunter biden's laptop 10 for the big guy far more evidence
[1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:51.240]  that was ever used in the two phony impeachments of donald trump by the way by your standard
[1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:59.560]  jamal uh your claim of civil uh war you should be referred to the justice department for prosecution
[1:36:59.560 --> 1:37:06.360]  because you're essentially saying that words uh are responsible for the actions of a handful on
[1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:11.880]  january 6th i understand that you hate the first amendment i understand that you see everything
[1:37:11.880 --> 1:37:17.240]  backwards no we do have replacements not a theory it's not a conspiracy theory the raw
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:24.120]  numbers are there what the uh republican uh control of congress might do would be to empower
[1:37:24.120 --> 1:37:30.680]  not white supremacists a tiny group but your friends in antifa and black lives matter who burned
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:37.320]  down half the country killed people did destroyed public and private property injured thousands
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:44.920]  jamal bowman is a clown he's a buffoon uh he's a jerk off the fact that uh he sees everything
[1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:51.320]  asked backwards is right out of the alinsky book but we've marked it down now you called for civil
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:56.440]  war if republicans won the house your you should be referred to the justice department
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:03.880]  for prosecution under your standard but of course i guess because democrats part of their makeup part
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:08.280]  of their fabric is terrorism i guess that's why they never have to answer to all their
[1:38:08.280 --> 1:38:12.440]  terroristic threats and crimes because that's part of their makeup whereas the republicans are
[1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:17.160]  christians and conservatives that love this country so uh you know somebody step sideways in dc
[1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:23.640]  they have to uh be sent to jail for for a year well what look there should be one standard uh
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:30.200]  essentially the january sixth committee hearing so far have produced a no beef what they're trying
[1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:36.360]  to say is that trump's public comments uh which are constitutionally protected free speech by the
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:43.000]  way it's interesting the way cnn always edits out what he says peacefully and patriotically
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:49.880]  march to the capital notice how they just truncate that to march to the capital not even clever uh
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:57.560]  but uh if that's true then vice president kamala here must be prosecuted for her responsibility
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:05.320]  in the blm antifa riots two summers ago by that standard she is responsible for those riots
[1:39:05.320 --> 1:39:11.880]  because she exercised her first amendment rights to support the burning down of half of america
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:18.360]  one standard one standard of justice but we haven't seen that so if you're hillary clinton
[1:39:18.360 --> 1:39:24.520]  if you're doc if you're general james clapper if you're uh islamic convert and former cia director
[1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:32.280]  john brennan if you're rod rozenstein if you're if you're james comey the fbi director
[1:39:32.280 --> 1:39:40.600]  andrew mccabe his deputy you can lie to congress with impunity regarding material matters that
[1:39:40.600 --> 1:39:47.880]  actually hide underlying crimes and you will not be prosecuted but if you make mistakes of
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:55.720]  omission that are immaterial irrelevant and hide no underlying crime as i did well you'll be not
[1:39:55.720 --> 1:40:02.520]  only railroaded in a soviet style show trial uh but you'll also they'll attempt to give you seven
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:08.680]  to nine years uh in prison if you're like going shroyer uh in which you just happen to be standing
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:14.760]  in the wrong place where you have destroyed no property assaulted no one trespassed nowhere
[1:40:14.760 --> 1:40:22.120]  broke hurt no one at all just standing in the wrong place a place that was secretly a special
[1:40:22.120 --> 1:40:27.000]  zone where you couldn't stand uh you'll be prosecuted for a crime even though you're a
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:33.400]  journalist and you're covering the event but if you're cnn cameraman or if you're john sullivan
[1:40:33.400 --> 1:40:41.320]  of antifa you you won't be harassed at all so we again the double standard uh as they said
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:47.640]  if it weren't for double standards liberals would have no standards whatsoever roger i think we have
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:53.960]  a bit of an insight here into maybe where the trump administration went a little sideways as we
[1:40:53.960 --> 1:41:00.360]  changed lanes leaked leaked texts between sean hannity and kailey mac and any come out during the j6
[1:41:00.360 --> 1:41:06.760]  hearing and it's sean hannity basically telling mac and any um no more crazy people which to me means
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:12.040]  it's the elitist hey no more people that aren't new york elitist or dc elitist getting trumps
[1:41:12.040 --> 1:41:17.000]  here getting trumps influence and uh he then goes on to say no more stolen election talk oh okay so
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:25.240]  let the democrats deal the elections he says um he wants hunter um to be pardoned and so some other
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:32.440]  stuff here i mean roger shed some light on this if you can and then the weird testimony from jason
[1:41:32.440 --> 1:41:38.600]  miller he's wearing a mask he says juliani was drunk i mean to me this is dc elitism this is
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:44.040]  our proof dc elitist we're trying to influence trump keep him away from the people and hannity
[1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:53.640]  must have been one of them uh let me take those backwards so uh in 1988 when the election pardon
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:42:01.080]  in 2000 when the election result was in doubt uh james a baker the third former secretary of state
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:09.800]  then running the recount operation for george w bush urged bush despite the fact that the returns
[1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:17.640]  were inconclusive to claim a victory he was hailed in the legacy media as a strategic genius now
[1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:26.200]  when rudy juliani gives the exact same advice to john trump while jason miller says that juliani
[1:42:26.200 --> 1:42:32.520]  was drunk no i think it was good political advice then it's good political advice now
[1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:40.840]  possession is nine tenths of the law particularly in the fight over a public perception so uh
[1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:48.200]  jason miller as you know works for getter funded by uh the chinese uh and uh he is a
[1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:54.680]  clearly not a reliable ally of the president by the way he did testify uh we gotta go to break
[1:42:54.680 --> 1:43:02.360]  right we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen we have the truth we have the smoking gun evidence
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:08.360]  we know what happened during the 2020 election how the deep state controlled democrats stole
[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:15.480]  the election all the proof absolutely cut and dry there's no denying it it's the film 2000 mules

[1:47:36.920 --> 1:47:42.120]  tireless fighting you've engaged in the ridicule the attacks the scorn the demonization the
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:47.720]  persecution and i want to just salute you again for what you've done it is a great honor to have
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:56.280]  the most deceitful known liars on the planet cnn put together a collection of disinformation lies
[1:47:56.920 --> 1:48:03.240]  and fraud and then package it and spew it against info wars and to have their affiliate
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:10.680]  organizations like yahoo and countless other publications you name it come out and regurgitate
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:19.480]  the lies the idea that we are an empire that info wars is an empire that we're the establishment
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:25.240]  and that we don't care about truth and that uh you wear all these horrible terrible things is
[1:48:25.240 --> 1:48:31.640]  just preposterous and i i don't have time and i'm not going to bore people's and i'm hardly anybody
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:37.240]  watching cnn with the disinformation they put out sunday but i went ahead and watched the whole
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:43.240]  thing yesterday i only watched pieces of it previously and it was just all regurgitated
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:51.000]  lies and just total gaslighting like alex talks about freedom but he was he was out there with
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:57.480]  protesters telling him not to wear a mask i mean what in the world do they think they're doing
[1:48:57.480 --> 1:49:05.960]  they've convinced themselves because they've got zombie banking from at&t and the establishment
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:10.760]  that they can just stay on air forever and even though they have basically no listeners
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:16.200]  it doesn't matter that their propaganda will override and silence the american people but
[1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:22.040]  i'll say this uh for some of the former employees that haven't worked in info wars in years and years
[1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:31.560]  and years who have made it their new job their new profession uh to go around the establishment
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:38.840]  media corridors and the state-run media and spew things that they know aren't true that i forgive
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:45.560]  them and i feel sorry for them and i understand that when trump got in a lot of people got pressured
[1:49:45.560 --> 1:49:51.640]  by their families and got intimidated and got threatened uh and that they were convinced that
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.200]  anybody associated with trump would be destroyed forever and and and certainly that's what the
[1:49:56.200 --> 1:50:02.840]  globals have tried to do and so they made decisions to basically defect uh or become benedict arnold's
[1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:09.240]  and join the establishment and and all i can say is america is going to win humanity is going to
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:13.880]  win people are waking up not just here but worldwide and you've chosen the wrong side of history but
[1:50:13.880 --> 1:50:22.440]  i forgive you and i just thank god every day that i don't come from the type of people that produce
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:29.320]  uh individuals that would do the type of things that they've done and they have to live for the
[1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:33.880]  rest of their lives with who they are and what they've done and the things they've said the things
[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:40.920]  they've done because they know that almost everything they said is not true and that the only
[1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:46.680]  kernels in there are basically things they took and and and twisted i can give so many examples
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:53.480]  but it's all based on the john ronson npr disinfo piece that was 95 lies and the rest twisted
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:59.800]  disinformation and there's also new york times article uh that one of them supposedly wrote
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:06.120]  a few years ago that's the same blueprint and folks there never was a goldfish period at the office
[1:51:07.160 --> 1:51:13.080]  on my children may i be struck down by 10 000 bolts of lightning there was never a goldfish
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:20.600]  and i didn't grab a goldfish out of a goldfish uh bowl and eat it because the employee wasn't
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:26.360]  doing their job that's the wolf of wall street and you know that's what's sick about the new york
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:34.040]  times and cnn is they they they just throw it in your face it it's like biden uh running around
[1:51:34.040 --> 1:51:39.800]  right now saying he doesn't want to hear about inflation and the economy because they're doing
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:45.160]  great things for people what the hell does that mean or saying it's russian disinformation
[1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:50.440]  or saying that it's putin's gas hike we all know it's him shutting down the pipelines
[1:51:50.440 --> 1:51:54.280]  and the drilling permits and on and on and on and the and the and the overprinting by the
[1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:58.040]  fellow reserve and and in fairness trump was part of that too this has been going on a long
[1:51:58.040 --> 1:52:03.880]  time but it accelerated under biden they printed more money in the last year and a half under biden
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:10.600]  that had ever been printed in the history of the united states over 250 years look it up so yeah
[1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:15.640]  trump pressed on the accelerator but at least we're trying to bring jobs back to us and make
[1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:21.640]  the dollar dominant and i still had some some criticism of it i'm not a trump cult but what
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:29.480]  biden's done is just jam the accelerator down through the floorboard and the idea that that
[1:52:29.480 --> 1:52:34.040]  it's a disinformation or russian disinfo to say that i mean these people fall to banana peel
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:39.320]  it's the russians so i'm really worried about this country in the world i'm worried about my
[1:52:39.320 --> 1:52:44.120]  children i'm worried about everybody's future and you know i told one of these individuals
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:50.920]  whenever they were defecting over to cnn and the establishment years ago i said listen
[1:52:51.960 --> 1:52:55.160]  you know you're going you're writing this piece you've called me you've told me you're writing
[1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:58.680]  you want me to be interviewed for it i'm not going to be interviewed for it but i said mark
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:03.160]  my words you'll be a creature of these people now for the rest of your life you'll now be
[1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:07.080]  in the system and you're going to find out how horrible they are i mean these are the folks that
[1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:12.600]  pushed the un-tested poison shot on people these people that are pushing the collapsed borders
[1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:17.880]  these are the people pushing all the fake wmd lies and the wars and the airport scanners and
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:24.680]  and just all of it that's another crazy part about the piece in cnn and again it's
[1:53:24.680 --> 1:53:30.600]  we're going to hear this info from the ronson stories that there wasn't radiation from fukashima
[1:53:30.600 --> 1:53:35.480]  and fukashima wasn't a big deal and it wasn't in the san francisco chronicle and west coast
[1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:42.120]  newspapers that they had up to five times elevated radiation and fish being caught off of san francisco
[1:53:42.680 --> 1:53:47.480]  and areas off anchorage alaska and that we didn't send people out there with geiger counters
[1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:52.040]  and it did the show three to five times the normal level that is exactly what the local newspaper
[1:53:52.040 --> 1:54:00.040]  said and then and then and then i'm bad because we sell iodine that's good for your thyroid when you
[1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:06.040]  can turn on national news and they're selling iodine and their precious zealinsky says people
[1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:13.320]  should be taking it i mean god zealinsky says take it so if god says it you see but the the idea is
[1:54:13.320 --> 1:54:17.240]  oh my god he sells water filters he tells you there's bad stuff in the water he says you water
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:22.520]  filters it's like if i own an outfitter so before somebody's about to go on the wilderness to pan
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:28.120]  for gold 150 years ago and i said you better buy some waterproof jackets or you'll freeze the death
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:32.760]  out there in the rain like look he's selling waterproof jackets well what kind of profiteer
[1:54:32.760 --> 1:54:36.600]  is that i mean i mean you do need a waterproof jacket when you're on the wilderness but you
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:42.840]  know you need a gun too but still why is he selling guns you know it's just totally insane how they
[1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:48.280]  operate as if they're not the establishment as if they're not owned by the arms manufacturers
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:52.840]  and big tech that's censoring and surveilling everybody it's just it's just sad to see people
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:57.240]  think that they can run into the skirts of the establishment under the black wings of the new
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:02.520]  world order that they're going to be winners and successful it's just so sad but hey the world's
[1:55:02.520 --> 1:55:06.760]  waking up america's waking up and humanity's winning and i commend and salute our listeners
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:10.920]  and supporters for all you've done the fact you're giving us more support than ever and as i said
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:18.040]  earlier everywhere i go we're just getting massive unprecedented support it just the outpouring of love
[1:55:18.040 --> 1:55:23.800]  is incredible i'd say we're getting five times the response on the street positive response we've
[1:55:23.800 --> 1:55:29.080]  ever gotten and so it really really shows that uh in the beginning of patriot's a scarce man hated
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:33.400]  feared scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the tim had joined him because then it cost nothing
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:38.360]  to be a patriot uh look i got a lot of negative stuff when trump first got in and i got a lot of
[1:55:38.360 --> 1:55:47.400]  attacks but it was still 10 to 1 now the negative stuff is 100 to 1 positive is 100 to 1 negative
[1:55:47.400 --> 1:55:52.680]  100 to 1 i mean hell more like 500 to 1 i don't even really get negative comments anymore a guy on
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:57.400]  the airport the other day said uh scumbag when you walk past me that's like the one thing i've

[2:00:19.720 --> 2:00:27.480]  sean hannity it just screams dc elitism new york elitism political elitism they don't want trump
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:31.880]  connected to the people they don't want the people with access to trump c trump's soul trump's heart
[2:00:31.880 --> 2:00:36.840]  which is what endeared him so much to his supporters and his vote and of course hannity was anti
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:42.600]  trump until he got into office i mean i just feel so much of the problem with dc politics and us
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:48.520]  politics exists right here lead class they know what their stake is they know what their hold is
[2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:54.680]  they know their control and they don't like it to be relinquished even sean hannity well first of
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:01:01.800]  all sean hannity is a friend of mine uh on the other hand this is a graphic example of why tucker
[2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:10.920]  carlson's ratings at fox have zoomed ahead of sean hannity's sean is traditionally a neocon
[2:01:10.920 --> 2:01:17.320]  republican um to his credit uh and with great gratitude i would tell you that he prayed for
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:25.480]  justice in my case and therefore i'm not going to criticize him uh in an unduly harsh way uh
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:32.200]  but i i do think as he's told me himself he doesn't even go to the bathroom without his lawyer
[2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:40.680]  and he recognizes that those who stand up to the new world order oh i don't know say alex jones
[2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:49.800]  for example or oan schreuer or maybe even roger stone uh you get targeted you get targeted by a
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:56.280]  politicized justice department they don't want to just defeat us politically they don't want to
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:02:03.160]  defeat us in an election or in a public debate they want to destroy us they want to incarcerate us
[2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:13.320]  and destroy us they can't win a debate they can't win a free fair exchange of ideas so uh i find none
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:22.920]  of this shocking in the sense that sean would seek to mollify uh the establishment also by the way
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:31.400]  in keeping with the new uh uh management style of fox i mean fox during the day if you see their
[2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:40.520]  program is every bit as debased and left-wing and misleading as cnn if it weren't for tucker carlson
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:49.160]  there'd be no reason to go to fox whatsoever uh and uh real conservatives are limited in their
[2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:56.680]  access in terms of being guests so if you're not an establishment republican uh other than the
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:03.560]  programming of tucker carlson where i believe he gets to choose his own guests you're not appearing
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:10.360]  on fox what's particularly interesting oan is is i look at republican primary voter data
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:17.640]  in the primaries in may and june and the upcoming primaries in july and august fox is losing ground
[2:03:17.640 --> 2:03:25.800]  every single day the number of patriots watching fox drops by the week many of them are coming here
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:35.320]  to info wars others are going to uh newsmax or oan uh or frank speech dot com or other uh more
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:43.320]  diffuse locations uh but sean hannity as you remember some of his most celebrated broadcasts
[2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:51.400]  were when he interviewed president george w bush so he is not an america first conservative
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:58.360]  he is a more traditional neocon conservative witness the way he has beat the drum for the war
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:06.360]  in ukraine roger stone ladies and gentlemen always entertaining informative and of course
[2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:11.320]  a great friend of mine roger uh you're going to be taking over here hosting the rest of the way i
[2:04:11.320 --> 2:04:16.760]  know you have a very important topics and a litany a range of topics as well including the latest
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.720]  cnn hit piece of alex jones i don't think it was a coincidence that they finally released it they've
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:26.200]  been sitting on it for a while now i don't think it's a coincidence this timing uh but you'll be
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:31.000]  talking about that coming up so ladies and gentlemen the next hour of the alex joneshow
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:36.840]  it's roger stone and then wane allen root so stick around don't go anywhere and folks remember to
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:41.480]  shop at info wars store dot com as usual you know sales are down when alex is out that gets him a
[2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:45.960]  little worried uh considering the attacks were under so go to info wars store dot com get yourself
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:51.080]  a tube of the super coral whitening toothpaste and all the other great supplements roger stone takes
[2:04:51.080 --> 2:05:02.200]  over on the other side the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alex jones was right
[2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:07.080]  people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling because i knew
[2:05:07.080 --> 2:05:13.080]  this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going to become
[2:05:13.080 --> 2:05:19.160]  more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:25.800]  documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the
[2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:32.280]  billderberg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:36.520]  because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching the children
[2:05:36.520 --> 2:05:40.920]  counting on us i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer
[2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:45.480]  and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here so you to really
[2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:50.520]  internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting
[2:05:50.520 --> 2:05:55.960]  chance so i want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your
[2:05:55.960 --> 2:06:10.680]  efforts welcome back i'm roger stone and this is the alex jones show i'm so delighted to be back
[2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:17.240]  in the saddle here substituting for my friend alex jones and off the bat i want to salute
[2:06:17.240 --> 2:06:26.120]  my colleague oan schreuer as many of you know uh for almost two years oan schreuer and i co-hosted
[2:06:26.120 --> 2:06:33.640]  the war room uh which shows from four o'clock uh central five o'clock eastern i think i have that
[2:06:33.640 --> 2:06:41.400]  right but it is must-watching for anyone who understands the info war in which we are engaged
[2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:51.160]  and as for my good friend oan schreuer we pray for justice in the outrageous prosecution of him
[2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:56.920]  where i believe he's being prosecuted essentially for standing in the wrong place at the wrong time
[2:06:56.920 --> 2:07:05.800]  on january 6th uh he is single-handedly pioneering the james a garfield look with that beard uh and he
[2:07:05.800 --> 2:07:15.160]  has never been better than he was on the air today today is the 76th birthday of president
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:26.840]  donald j trump uh without any question donald trump in 2016 upsets the apple cart for the two-party
[2:07:26.840 --> 2:07:35.080]  duopoly that had been running for president you see the 2016 election was a settled matter
[2:07:35.080 --> 2:07:43.080]  it was going to be hillary clinton versus a former florida governor jeb bush uh and the
[2:07:43.080 --> 2:07:51.560]  globalist one world one government policies of the two-party duopoly we're going to move forward
[2:07:52.840 --> 2:08:01.320]  without any interruption along comes the most improbable political candidate in american
[2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:10.520]  political history not since 1940 has either major party actually nominated a businessman
[2:08:10.520 --> 2:08:19.640]  for president uh and of course the mainstream media builds donald trump up in the pre-nomination
[2:08:19.640 --> 2:08:28.600]  phase particularly fox news i might add on the false assumption that trump would be the easiest
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:36.840]  republican for hillary clinton to defeat in truth the exact opposite turns out to be true in other
[2:08:36.840 --> 2:08:44.840]  words uh in based on my 40 years in american politics i don't believe any of the other republican
[2:08:44.840 --> 2:08:54.280]  candidates be they jeb bush marco rubio carly fiorina any of these candidates would have stood
[2:08:54.280 --> 2:09:03.800]  any chance against the vaunted clinton machine what is it that is trump's great strength by the way
[2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:10.680]  we don't defend everything that he did we don't agree with everything that he did but on balance
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:20.520]  he essentially puts america first rebuilds our economy to give us the most robust economy in
[2:09:20.520 --> 2:09:30.520]  american history the greatest rate of job creation in our history the greatest rate of wage increases
[2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:39.880]  in our history he appoints scores of conservatives to the judiciary at all federal levels uh he
[2:09:39.880 --> 2:09:47.720]  restores respect and more importantly fear for america around the world regarding our adversaries
[2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:55.800]  but he also much as nixon going to china is the only president who is able to engage the north
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:04.360]  koreans who have on their way to nuclear weapons in a dialogue when barack obama left office he
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:12.120]  told donald trump two things one your greatest single danger is the north koreans uh advice
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:19.480]  echoed by the way by bill clinton to joe biden uh the other thing he told him was whatever you do
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:27.080]  don't appoint general michael flinn to any office well donald trump actually was able to open the
[2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:33.720]  door to the north koreans because he believes that talking is always better than a nuclear war
[2:10:34.680 --> 2:10:43.240]  now of course under joe biden the north koreans have restarted their nuclear weapons development
[2:10:43.240 --> 2:10:54.200]  program the question i get the most of course is is trump going to run again in 2024 the answer
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:11:00.520]  to your question is based on my own conversations with him i think he would like to i think he
[2:11:00.520 --> 2:11:09.400]  is inclined to i also think that he has not yet made a decision there was a story in yesterday's
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:19.160]  uk daily mail uh which said that the president plans a florida-based announcement of his 2024
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:29.080]  candidacy uh this summer uh and that the purpose in doing so is to steal a march on florida governor
[2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:36.680]  ron desantis checking out this story on my own i think that is not necessarily inaccurate
[2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:44.120]  but i do think it is premature i do not see president trump making a decision about the
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:54.520]  2024 elections uh prior to the 2022 elections after all if you don't find out whether the 2022
[2:11:54.520 --> 2:12:05.400]  elections are fair free transparent and honest why would you risk all in yet another election uh
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:13.080]  ron desantis is running for president no matter what he tells you today he has amassed a hundred
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:20.520]  million dollars in his state campaign fund he has amassed another 90 million dollars in a
[2:12:20.520 --> 2:12:28.680]  federal campaign fund uh he has been a good governor of florida i will most definitely vote
[2:12:28.680 --> 2:12:35.320]  for his reelection as governor i particularly like the way he has taken on the culture war
[2:12:36.040 --> 2:12:44.360]  where he has fought those who would foist gender race or sexual lies upon our children
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:51.320]  but in many cases i wish that his rhetoric would match his record so for example when governor
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:58.360]  desantis says uh when they send illegal immigrants here to florida i'm going to send them back to
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:06.120]  delaware fabulous applause line great applause line unfortunately he has yet to send anybody
[2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:13.640]  to delaware or anyone they're anywhere they're over 248 000 illegals who have been resettled
[2:13:13.640 --> 2:13:19.560]  in the state of florida they come here by plane they come here by bus uh and none of them have
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:28.520]  been deported then there's the question of nancy polosi's secret police force uh through an act of
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:34.840]  congress uh we know that the house in the senate appropriated monies for a legislative based
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:42.120]  branch of the capitol hill police well with a barracks somewhere between orlando and tampa
[2:13:42.120 --> 2:13:50.040]  and that there are five up to 500 uh capitol hill police officers in the state of florida investigating
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:57.880]  right wing extremism this is unheard of in american history a police force that reports to
[2:13:57.880 --> 2:14:05.480]  nancy polosi not to the justice department not to the fbi so uh i would like to see governor
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:13.800]  santa santis uh do something about that and do it soon we also have the election uh integrity
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:22.920]  issue i believe that there are 1.6 million uh phantom voters uh on the rolls here in florida
[2:14:22.920 --> 2:14:28.600]  what we should do about that while we'll talk about that on the other side um we are going to
[2:14:28.600 --> 2:14:36.360]  bring you a message now from info wars dot com's store because as oan said as alex said in the last
[2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:44.360]  segment it is absolutely vital to keep info wars on the air as that beacon of freedom as that

[2:20:12.040 --> 2:20:19.480]  welcome back i'm roger stone and i'm proud to be sitting in for alex jones
[2:20:21.080 --> 2:20:28.120]  several months ago cnn began promoting a special on alex jones
[2:20:28.120 --> 2:20:36.360]  they spent millions of dollars and many precious minutes on the air promoting the coming hatchet
[2:20:36.360 --> 2:20:47.560]  job the title megaphone for conspiracy finally this aired at eight o'clock eastern time this past
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:55.640]  sunday night in the 40 years that i've been involved in american politics i have never seen
[2:20:55.640 --> 2:21:05.320]  a more audacious hatchet job let me tell you about the alex jones uh that i know uh i didn't meet alex
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:14.120]  jones until the 50th anniversary of john f kennedy's assassination uh when uh he was in dealie plaza
[2:21:14.120 --> 2:21:23.080]  and i was also there promoting my first book the man who killed kennedy the case against lbj uh we
[2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:30.280]  met uh and he invited me to be interviewed on info wars which would come to pass uh we subsequently
[2:21:30.280 --> 2:21:38.120]  became extraordinarily good friends the reason i like alex jones is the reason i like donald trump
[2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:46.440]  because he's genuine because he's authentic because he's real it's not an act it's not
[2:21:46.440 --> 2:21:55.480]  artifice it's he doesn't have an on-air personality and an off-air personality he is a true american
[2:21:55.480 --> 2:22:05.640]  patriot uh yes the entire way info wars sets up to be completely self-sufficient is ingenious
[2:22:06.280 --> 2:22:13.080]  it's entrepreneurial genius you see alex jones doesn't have to worry about pressure from his
[2:22:13.080 --> 2:22:20.680]  advertisers he doesn't have to worry about being taken off the air or censored or shut down
[2:22:20.680 --> 2:22:28.760]  because he owns his own servers sure there was a time when many people watched this program through
[2:22:28.760 --> 2:22:37.720]  spotify or youtube or hulu and other places but even when there was a massive conspiracy which
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:45.560]  on one single day alex jones and the alex jones show and info wars were de-platformed across the
[2:22:45.560 --> 2:22:54.360]  board because of the loyalty of the info wars audience people quickly went to the url info
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:23:00.920]  wars dot com where this program can be seen every day not to mention the american journal
[2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:09.160]  with ericsson smith uh in the war room uh with oh and schwar and uh this is what drives the left
[2:23:09.160 --> 2:23:17.640]  crazy but let's let's get into some of the specifics no alex jones never punched somebody in the arm
[2:23:17.640 --> 2:23:25.080]  so hard that they split their arm open and there was blood everywhere that never happened alex
[2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:32.440]  jones never said i'm only in this for the money i have no interest in the truth alex jones never
[2:23:32.440 --> 2:23:41.160]  said that and that is not what he believes uh alex jones although you may disagree with his views
[2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:47.960]  on sandy hook i do for example i believe he has a first amendment right to say anything he wishes
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:55.080]  regardless of how repugnant or or offensive it may be to some people therefore i believe the
[2:23:55.080 --> 2:24:01.880]  cases against him have been wrongly decided again i'm not defending the substance of what he's
[2:24:01.880 --> 2:24:11.400]  accused of saying i'm defending his right to say it that's how the constitution works uh so it is
[2:24:11.400 --> 2:24:18.200]  an outrageous takedown but what's most obvious about this new documentary is the way it must have
[2:24:18.200 --> 2:24:26.920]  been quickly re-edited first of all interviewing uh alex jones's ex-wife she's certainly an unbiased
[2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:34.600]  witness wouldn't you say she has no axe to grind by the way red beans and rice didn't miss ha
[2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:43.080]  uh i thought that was a particularly vicious part of this hatchet job but what they really
[2:24:43.080 --> 2:24:49.480]  hate more than anything else is the continued existence of info wars the fact that we are
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:57.320]  even here and the fact that we are self-sufficient uh in these times of stress and believe me my
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:07.480]  wife and i have known extraordinary stress because in the period after my pardon we have been subjected
[2:25:07.480 --> 2:25:16.200]  to no less than 17 baseless fraudulent highly sensationalized lawsuits uh which are designed
[2:25:16.200 --> 2:25:23.480]  to both drag by name in the mud yet again i'm already clickbait uh and run up run up massive

[2:32:01.400 --> 2:32:05.560]  propaganda by the corporate media by the controlled churches and the universities
[2:32:06.360 --> 2:32:12.600]  why is this the case because we innately by god have been given the keys for our own minds our
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:18.840]  own side he's our own souls and by connecting to god we can empower ourselves and transcend sin
[2:32:18.840 --> 2:32:25.320]  the quote fallen or sinful state so the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring
[2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:31.560]  into our bodies to change who we are are only lowering us they're only making us more depressed
[2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:36.680]  from the end they're only making us less fulfilled it is only by going within and really making that
[2:32:36.680 --> 2:32:41.320]  connection to god that we can truly empower ourselves that's why the globalist bombardists
[2:32:41.320 --> 2:32:46.520]  and toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements
[2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:52.280]  our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension
[2:32:52.280 --> 2:32:55.240]  and that's where the incredible products come in at infowarstore.com
[2:32:55.240 --> 2:33:11.160]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:11.880 --> 2:33:21.160]  welcome back this is roger stone and i'm delighted to be back in the host chair on the alex jones show
[2:33:21.160 --> 2:33:29.480]  alex is taking some well deserved rest let me return to the cnn hatchet job on alex jones
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:36.280]  that showed on sunday night don't be surprised if you missed it so did most of the people
[2:33:36.280 --> 2:33:42.840]  who had a television set on because if there weren't airports well nobody would be watching cnn
[2:33:43.480 --> 2:33:49.960]  the idea that they would put on oliver darcy a man with no credibility whatsoever to assault alex
[2:33:49.960 --> 2:33:56.840]  jones man who has pretty much turned out to be right about most but not everything that he has
[2:33:56.840 --> 2:34:04.840]  predicted from the time he began in radio and locally there in austin well that's a little
[2:34:04.840 --> 2:34:13.880]  hard to swallow this was a hatchet job i personally suspect checkbook journalism in other words
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:23.640]  those former info wars uh employees who came forward to disparage the work being done by alex
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:30.280]  jones and the hardworking people in info wars i question whether they were paid for their
[2:34:30.280 --> 2:34:40.360]  appearances i don't assert it i simply question it that cnn is not above paying for those to smear
[2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:48.040]  jones well that's indisputable uh there he is now there is the bdi look of a criminal and a
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:58.680]  congenital liar take a look uh so what is the real purpose of this documentary that was revealed
[2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:07.240]  in the final two thirds of the documentary uh there is no question that like me alex jones was
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:16.440]  present in washington dc on january 5th and 6th there is no question that alex jones exercised
[2:35:16.440 --> 2:35:24.680]  his first amendment right of free expression to question the accuracy uh and the uh uh and the
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:33.400]  authenticity of the results of the 2020 election there is no question that alex jones unlike me
[2:35:33.400 --> 2:35:41.240]  chose to go to the president's speech at the ellipse march to the capital uh and uh was at the
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:49.800]  capital but no one has found a link where alex jones urged anyone directly or indirectly to
[2:35:49.800 --> 2:35:59.640]  violate the law in fact alex jones like me supported a 10 day delay in the certification
[2:35:59.640 --> 2:36:06.760]  of the electoral college by the way we don't argue that vice president mike pence had the
[2:36:06.760 --> 2:36:13.480]  authority to just reject the certification of the electoral college vote for joe biden
[2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:19.880]  we simply argue that he had the constitutional right to send the decision back to individual
[2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:27.000]  states where quite clearly under the law the authority lies with the state legislatures
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:33.720]  to determine whether the vote in their state was honest uh and legitimate uh and to award
[2:36:33.720 --> 2:36:41.080]  electors on the basis of that decision so the effort by some or the actions by some
[2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:48.840]  to breach of the capital were completely and totally counterproductive uh to what we were
[2:36:48.840 --> 2:36:55.960]  trying to achieve what we were trying to achieve is based in constitutional free speech and the
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:37:03.320]  constitutional right uh of under the fourth amendment for americans to gather together
[2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:11.080]  and express peacefully and patriotically their point of view in the alex jones documentary
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:17.320]  the actual bite of donald trump is edited to take the words peacefully and patriotically out
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:23.640]  so he's urged people to march to the capital but not peacefully and patriotically because
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:32.680]  oliver darcy and his illegitimate friends edited that section out if there is a subtitle for the
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:40.120]  alex jones special it should be why alex jones should be indicted regarding january 6 despite
[2:37:40.120 --> 2:37:47.000]  any evidence whatsoever that he did anything illegal look closely folks that's the face of a
[2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:56.280]  psychopath uh it is uh very reminiscent of a long five page article that was done by the
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:05.240]  washington post uh which once again proves that i wasn't at the ellipse i wasn't at did not march
[2:38:05.240 --> 2:38:13.000]  to the capital i was not at the capital i did speak on january 5 to the same rally alex jones
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:19.160]  spoke to it was a particularly effective speech by jones i think it was also a pretty effective
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:25.880]  a speech that i gave unfortunately you can't find it now since youtube has under their censorship
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:34.280]  policies removed it from the internet but when i said that my apocalyptic view of the choices
[2:38:34.280 --> 2:38:43.400]  facing america a choice between good and evil a choice between dark and light a choice between
[2:38:43.400 --> 2:38:51.400]  the godly and the godless and my belief that if we fail america steps off into a thousand
[2:38:51.400 --> 2:38:59.800]  years of darkness cnn said that was fomenting violence no that's cnn engaging in religious
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:06.840]  bigotry uh i do believe that that this is not a struggle between republicans and democrats
[2:39:07.480 --> 2:39:14.600]  it's not a struggle between two alternative governing philosophies the once great democratic
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:20.760]  party of harry truman and john f kennedy has been captive by a small group of socialists
[2:39:20.760 --> 2:39:29.640]  ney communists who are bent in destroying the u.s constitution uh in the end they will destroy
[2:39:29.640 --> 2:39:37.480]  the corporate democrats like nasty pig loci and chuck schumer those who thrive and gorge on
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:46.360]  corporate campaign contributions uh know the aocs of the world the jamal bowens if you will
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:53.800]  know that's the future of the democratic party a democratic party that doesn't include any working
[2:39:53.800 --> 2:40:02.840]  class folks that doesn't include any uh uh any regular middle class people a party of elites
[2:40:03.400 --> 2:40:10.440]  and extremists normally that would be a problem for the political party but not if you don't expect
[2:40:10.440 --> 2:40:19.640]  to have to face any free fair honest elections which leads me to my belief that before the next
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:28.360]  election we will have another pandemic another pandemic perhaps i should say some believe it
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:35.480]  will be a monkey pox although i think our problem today is more better described as donkey pox
[2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:44.520]  uh but the excuse to give joe biden the ability to sign a executive order that mandates that there
[2:40:44.520 --> 2:40:53.160]  can be no in-person voting and that all voting must be done by mail-in ballot amazing that you
[2:40:53.160 --> 2:41:00.200]  have attorney general bar testifying for the january sixth committee saying uh that the uh
[2:41:00.200 --> 2:41:06.120]  that the claims of election fraud are to accuse his exact words bullshit when he admits in the
[2:41:06.120 --> 2:41:15.240]  next breath that he never actually investigated any of them so how would he know i think donald
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:21.400]  trump's analysis is exactly right once bill bar was threatened with impeachment by the u.s house
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:27.000]  and a democratic majority in the senate not wanting to go down as the first attorney general in
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:35.320]  history to be impeached he began undermining the trump administration if president trump had merely
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:41.400]  bothered to look at his wikipedia entry and seen who he was and that he had run the drug
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:48.600]  trafficking operations through the cia through mina arkansas while working for george bush
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:56.280]  perhaps he would never have appointed bill bar at all and no bill bar did not intercede with the
[2:41:56.280 --> 2:42:02.520]  prosecutors in my case to argue for a more lenient sentence the washington post themselves
[2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:09.720]  have reported that the three top non-political uh career prosecutors at the department justice
[2:42:09.720 --> 2:42:16.440]  testified under oath that that was entirely false we're going to go to a message here from

[2:47:02.840 --> 2:47:20.200]  welcome back i'm roger stone sitting in for alex jones so let's wrap up the hatchet job
[2:47:20.200 --> 2:47:28.920]  that cnn aired on alex jones last night funny uh it doesn't cover the part about secret service
[2:47:28.920 --> 2:47:37.160]  agents suddenly appearing and offering to escort alex jones to the capital had jones
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:44.280]  not stopped for a bathroom break he would have arrived at the capital at the precise time that
[2:47:44.280 --> 2:47:52.360]  i believe government provocateurs were breaking into the u.s capital funny they also don't show
[2:47:52.360 --> 2:47:59.320]  jones jumping up i think on a chair uh with a bullhorn urging people to pull back pointing out
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:08.120]  this is a peaceful demonstration they truncated that uh there is no uh connection as the fbi
[2:48:08.120 --> 2:48:15.800]  was reported to have concluded by roiders some months ago that either alex jones or i were
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:26.360]  involved in any conspiracy to violate the law on january 6th or on any other date at any other
[2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:36.760]  location uh this entire tactic is known as guilt by association do i know donald trump and do i
[2:48:36.760 --> 2:48:44.840]  speak to him occasionally yes do i know members of the proud boys yes did i come in contact with
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:52.840]  members of the oath keepers on january 5th yes that proves absolutely positively nothing
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:49:01.640]  and so is the non case against alex jones so the special which aired sunday night is an attempt
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:11.560]  to stampede the justice department into some kind of prosecution of jones who like me has done nothing
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:21.800]  wrong uh the level of uh hatred and bloodlust among menopausal harpies uh on twitter screaming
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:28.520]  that i need to be held accountable accountable for what knowing people uh let me say it again
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:38.440]  there is no text message no encrypted message no email no phone call no witness that can tie me in
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:47.960]  any way to the wrongheaded and illegal actions at the capital on january 6th or on any other date
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:56.200]  or time any assertion to the contrary is categorically false and no one including the january 6th
[2:49:56.200 --> 2:50:04.040]  committee has been able to locate any evidence or proof to the contrary i believe this is also the
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:11.160]  case when it comes to alex jones who's been subjected to one of the most vicious attacks
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:20.040]  in american political or media history but anyone who has any illusions about alex jones giving up
[2:50:20.040 --> 2:50:26.760]  or quitting or riding off into the sunset or ending his fight for america against the globalist
[2:50:26.760 --> 2:50:37.160]  does not understand alex jones what you see is what you get he is 100 percent patriot
[2:50:38.120 --> 2:50:46.040]  folks i hate to complain and i hate to ask for help uh it really pains me but as i said earlier
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:53.640]  my wife and i have been targeted in no less than 17 completely frivolous groundless unsubstantiated
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:51:03.640]  uh uh legal suits uh civil suits against us there is literally not a single month in which
[2:51:03.640 --> 2:51:11.240]  the total of my legal bills and the total of my wife's unpaid medical bills that were uninsured
[2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:18.040]  in her fight against stage 4 cancer do not exceed the amount of money that i made that month so
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:28.200]  please go to stonefamilyfund.com stonefamilyfund.com i hate asking perhaps as much as you are tired
[2:51:28.200 --> 2:51:36.360]  of being asked uh but i will not give up the fight for freedom i will not plead to any phony
[2:51:36.360 --> 2:51:43.720]  civil suit financed by george soros and his minions and i will never stop fighting for freedom
[2:51:43.720 --> 2:51:50.920]  or appearing here on info wars so please could you find it in your heart to send a contribution
[2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:58.520]  to the stonefamily fund where mr stone and i are drowning in debt between our legal bills
[2:51:58.520 --> 2:52:04.120]  and her uh uninsured medical bills god will bless you for it
[2:52:04.120 --> 2:52:16.200]  uh speaking of cnn uh part of the overall scheme here is a uh is a special they ran sunday night
[2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:25.320]  right after the hatchet job uh on alex jones uh on watergate called uh blueprint for something or
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:32.280]  other uh we have a graphic here for it someplace this is the second greatest uh act of fiction
[2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:41.000]  i have ever seen this is supposedly the blueprint for scandal uh one man's story of watergate from
[2:52:41.000 --> 2:52:50.680]  the man that ended it no let's be clear john w dean is the man who conceived of planned pushed and
[2:52:50.680 --> 2:52:58.360]  covered up the watergate break-in and then lied to president uh richard nixon for 19
[2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:06.920]  straight months about it uh everything in this hatchet job is fictional uh we see carol bernstein
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:17.480]  lying about who deep throat really is uh we see tim naftali uh an extremely angry gay man a nixon
[2:53:17.480 --> 2:53:24.920]  hater but who's billed as the founder and first director of the nixon presidential library let
[2:53:24.920 --> 2:53:33.640]  me explain that to you when the nixon library ceased to be privately funded through contributions
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:41.800]  mostly because nixon's many contemporaries had passed on and therefore went under the control
[2:53:41.800 --> 2:53:48.280]  of the federal archivist they inserted a nixon hating leftist and one of the most vile human
[2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:56.280]  beings i've ever met tim naftali a total piece of human garbage as the director of the library
[2:53:56.280 --> 2:54:02.600]  he would then take the nixon library and refashion it to focus not on nixon's historic
[2:54:02.600 --> 2:54:10.120]  breakthrough uh of uh strategic arm limitations with the soviets not with his uh historic
[2:54:10.120 --> 2:54:17.080]  desegregation of the public schools not over his skillful playing off of the chinese uh against
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:25.880]  the russians uh by recognizing china at the time it had more oxen than it had automobiles unable
[2:54:25.880 --> 2:54:33.560]  to foresee the day uh when president george bush would give them most favored nation trading
[2:54:33.560 --> 2:54:42.200]  status uh but uh nothing about this narrative is true john dean lied to the senate uh intelligence
[2:54:42.200 --> 2:54:48.440]  committee uh pardon me the senate watergate committee he lied under oath to the senate uh
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:57.720]  the watergate prosecutors he was a disbarred he is the perp he is the man who covered up watergate
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:05.880]  and he lied to president richard nixon for nine long months about it what's the significance
[2:55:05.880 --> 2:55:15.720]  to january six quite simply who should pop up in the cnn special uh on watergate but michael cohen
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:22.600]  i checked michael cohen was nine years old during watergate why did they interview him well he had
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:30.360]  to equate the character flaws of richard nixon with the character flaws of donald trump the
[2:55:30.360 --> 2:55:36.840]  allegation that just as nixon lied about watergate he wasn't lying he'd been misled by his council
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:45.320]  john dean while now donald trump is lying about january sixth you see how it all fits together
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:52.840]  folks uh i want to remind you one more time i wouldn't be able to be with you today uh without the

[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:28.280]  you know drank the vaccine covid vaccine kool aid they're all stepford wives so you could absolutely
[3:01:28.280 --> 3:01:33.320]  bet that justin beaver is vaccinated you could aptly bet that ray leota was vaccinated you can't
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:38.680]  get out of movie or tv set or step on a music stage without being vaccinated and it's happening
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:46.120]  the shoe is dropping all over the world there's ray leota's picture and i'm a great fan of ray leota
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:54.120]  and uh justin beaver and his wife both injured and both again this is an opinion show it's my
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:02:01.080]  opinion they're public figures it's clear to me they're part of the vaccine injury and death disaster
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:07.000]  going on in the united states of america so i'll talk about my donald trump interview
[3:02:07.560 --> 3:02:12.440]  coming up in the next segment i want to make this a mystery i want you to hold on and get excited
[3:02:12.440 --> 3:02:18.200]  because there were some huge eye-opening revelations because trump and i are great friends and have
[3:02:18.200 --> 3:02:22.840]  been for a long time and he's very comfortable around me so it wasn't an interview it was like
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:29.080]  two great friends talking and you got to listen in and so because he's a little bit looser
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:35.640]  than in a normal interview and not on guard he said some things that i think are very important
[3:02:35.640 --> 3:02:41.160]  for everyone to hear and i think that the media will take some of them and make them into headlines
[3:02:41.160 --> 3:02:47.400]  around the world just as we did last year not last year but maybe about six eight months ago
[3:02:47.400 --> 3:02:55.160]  i was the guy who created the idea of trump becoming house speaker he needs to be house
[3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.520]  speaker i said and he said great idea i like that i've never heard of anyone before and i said it
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:07.320]  to him right on uh live radio and so all of a sudden that became headlines all over the world
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:11.240]  literally all of the united states all over the world was that wane root said to donald trump
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:15.960]  you should be house speaker and what many of them didn't know was a lot of them said but it was
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:20.920]  steve bannon's original idea i love steve bannon he's a friend of mine too but sorry steve it was
[3:03:20.920 --> 3:03:26.760]  my idea steve bannon first spoke about it at a speech in boston and i think it was uh february
[3:03:26.760 --> 3:03:35.480]  of 2021 and i was the guy who brought the idea up and wrote it in a column in january of 2021
[3:03:35.480 --> 3:03:40.040]  i think it was two weeks after biden was sworn in as president i wrote a column and said trump's
[3:03:40.040 --> 3:03:45.320]  gotta be speaker the house and i'll tell you the significance of why trump needs to be speaker of
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:49.720]  the house uh and wait till you hear what trump had to say about it because everyone assumes
[3:03:49.720 --> 3:03:54.920]  that he will not do that because he endorsed kevin mccarthy but i have breaking news for you
[3:03:54.920 --> 3:03:59.400]  from my interview with president trump but i need to explain why he needs to be speaker of the house
[3:04:00.040 --> 3:04:07.560]  because he can lead the impeachment of biden and kamala harris for the crimes and the trees
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:12.120]  they've committed against the united states and once they're both thrown out of office
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:17.000]  guess who's next in line to be president speaker of the house that's how donald trump
[3:04:17.000 --> 3:04:22.040]  becomes president of the house quickly because i don't believe we could wait till 2024 i don't
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:27.880]  believe this country will last till 2024 and i asked president trump about that and guess what
[3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:34.440]  he had a wild answer that you're gonna want to hear uh about whether america can last till 2024
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:40.760]  wait now the root root for america dot com and my email wane root at gmail dot com we'll be right
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:47.240]  back more about justin beaver ray leota my commentary about the covid vaccine in my interview with
[3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:59.640]  president donald j trump you know it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:04.200]  90s when the internet and mobile technology first came out which is we thought you know this is
[3:05:04.200 --> 3:05:07.480]  going to level the playing field everybody's going to have access to the same information
[3:05:07.480 --> 3:05:12.840]  everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information that's our goal to get back to
[3:05:12.840 --> 3:05:18.520]  that place where we all have access to all of the information we all have the ability to freely
[3:05:18.520 --> 3:05:23.960]  communicate that information with whomever we want whenever we want and we don't have to worry
[3:05:23.960 --> 3:05:30.200]  about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some
[3:05:30.200 --> 3:05:35.800]  way to go after us because of the conversations we're having because of the internet searches
[3:05:35.800 --> 3:05:41.240]  that we're doing because of the the discussions the people we want to talk to about these things
[3:05:41.240 --> 3:05:46.040]  so that's our goal is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their
[3:05:46.040 --> 3:05:51.160]  privacy and so that's really what we're trying to do and so i hope uh that everybody listening

[3:07:15.240 --> 3:07:22.520]  i want to explain why i know and understand liberal democrats who worship the vaccine god better than
[3:07:22.520 --> 3:07:29.160]  any conservative in america it's because i know nothing but liberal democrats all my life i grew
[3:07:29.160 --> 3:07:36.040]  up on a dead end street on the bronx borderline in a majority minority city i attended almost 100
[3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:44.680]  black middle school and almost a 90 black high school and almost everyone i knew was a democrat
[3:07:44.680 --> 3:07:53.240]  i grew up jewish attended synagogue and was bar mitzvah almost every jew i knew was a democrat
[3:07:53.240 --> 3:08:01.080]  from my rabbi to my own uncle and aunts i accepted i was accepted to columbia university
[3:08:01.080 --> 3:08:07.320]  one of the finest ivy lee colleges in america forget democrats virtually every human being
[3:08:07.320 --> 3:08:13.640]  there classmate and professor identified and bragged to me that they were either socialist marxists
[3:08:13.640 --> 3:08:21.320]  or communists i became host of five television shows on financial news network now known as cnbc
[3:08:21.320 --> 3:08:28.120]  and everyone i met in journalism broadcasting television and media was an ultra liberal democrat
[3:08:28.120 --> 3:08:34.200]  everyone i lived for 13 years in malibu california and everyone i met malibu was an ultra liberal
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:40.840]  democrat and one more unique tidbit of my life i'm a lifelong health food and vitamin enthusiast
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:47.400]  and for decades almost everyone i met in vitamin stores identified as liberal democrats so i've
[3:08:47.400 --> 3:08:54.040]  been living and working around liberal democrats socialists marxists and communists my entire life
[3:08:54.040 --> 3:09:01.880]  i may understand them better than any conservative or republican in america and never never ever
[3:09:01.880 --> 3:09:09.000]  did politics or liberal democrat politics in particular ever have anything to do with medicine
[3:09:09.000 --> 3:09:15.160]  or vaccines actually to the contrary most of the liberal democrats i've met in my life
[3:09:15.160 --> 3:09:22.120]  were cynical anti-establishment never trusted anything politicians or government told them
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:31.240]  hated and distrusted big pharma and were almost always anti-vaccine most of the birkenstock crowd
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:36.440]  that i met in vitamin stores and health stores would not allow their children to be vaccinated
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:41.880]  most of the liberal mothers i met over the years and i lived in manhattan the hollywood hills below
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:47.800]  the hollywood sign and malibu so i know liberal mothers better than anyone most of them did not
[3:09:47.800 --> 3:09:56.200]  trust vaccines and believe vaccines caused autism so how did we get here because right now at this
[3:09:56.200 --> 3:10:02.040]  moment in time liberal democrats and assorted socialist marxists and communists who make up the
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:07.640]  democrat party and in particular everyone in hollywood and the entertainment industry have
[3:10:07.640 --> 3:10:19.240]  spent the past 18 months in a spell mass psychosis a steppford wife trance a jim jones of gyan alike
[3:10:19.240 --> 3:10:25.880]  kool-aid drinking mass brainwashing event the liberal democrats i've known my whole life
[3:10:25.880 --> 3:10:33.000]  were mostly atheists yet today suddenly every democrat i meet believes in god and they've all
[3:10:33.000 --> 3:10:41.560]  found religion their god of choice is the covid vaccine and their religion is vaccinology they
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:48.520]  love vaccinology so much many of them have switched from Scientology their liberal crowd is filled
[3:10:48.520 --> 3:10:55.000]  with addicts drug addicts alcohol addicts sex addicts they all go to AA meetings but now their
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:11:02.200]  addiction of choice is the covid vaccine the needle and instead of AA meetings soon they'll
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:10.120]  be attending the a meetings vaccine anonymous suddenly every liberal democrat in hollywood
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:17.160]  loves covid vaccines like christians love jesus christ they worship the needle they're desperate
[3:11:17.160 --> 3:11:24.120]  for boosters for their boosters suddenly democrats ask no questions they trust everything
[3:11:24.120 --> 3:11:30.680]  that big pharma tells them they hate capitalism and anyone who makes money they call them greedy
[3:11:30.680 --> 3:11:37.080]  yet big pharma committing fraud and covering up vaccine injuries and deaths to make trillions
[3:11:37.080 --> 3:11:43.640]  of dollars and turn big pharma executives into billionaires doesn't bother them in the slightest
[3:11:44.360 --> 3:11:51.400]  if a brain dead zombie puppet with diapers and dementia i.e. joe biden tells them the vaccine
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:59.240]  is safe they just roll up their sleeves and say your wish is my command hollywood limousine liberals
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:08.280]  want the covid vaccine god on the back of coins in vax we trust funny but doesn't it sound a lot
[3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:15.080]  like what happened under stalin and hitler and casserole and reverend jim jones and gianna
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:23.880]  all over the world athletes politicians actors rock stars and television celebrities
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:31.160]  have been dying suddenly or suffering cardiac arrest heart issues strokes blood clots and
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:36.920]  massive increases in cancer all since 2021 and the advent of the vaccine
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:49.800]  athlete deaths are up 1700 percent as in 1,700 percent fifa as in pro soccer deaths are up
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:12:57.160]  fivefold almost 100 percent are heart related they're dropping dead on the soccer field
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:04.600]  millennial deaths are up by a staggering 84 percent since the advent of the vaccine
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:11.560]  the numbers are shocking ask any life insurance executive or funeral homeowner ask any cardiac
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:18.200]  nurse study the veirs report but now it's hitting home in hollywood in recent weeks one of my favorite
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:23.960]  actors ray leota died in his sleep on the set of his latest movie was he vaccinated almost
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:29.880]  certainly because no actor can get on a movie set without proof of vaccination we don't know
[3:13:29.880 --> 3:13:34.920]  whether it's covid vaccine related but we could certainly guess and we should certainly be asking
[3:13:34.920 --> 3:13:40.440]  questions we should certainly investigate and then only days ago 28 year old superstar singer
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:47.880]  justin beaver went public with his face paralysis from a rare disease called ramsey hunt syndrome
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:54.040]  from a virus in the shingles family beaver was forced to cancel his latest tour shockingly
[3:13:54.040 --> 3:14:01.000]  his 26 year old wife had a mini stroke unexpectedly only weeks ago these are medical conditions that
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:07.240]  mimic vaccine injuries happening all over the world where beaver and his young wife vaccinated
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:15.240]  almost certainly his fans are not even allowed to attend his concerts without proof of vaccination
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:22.200]  so are his injuries from the vaccine is his wife 26 year old wife stroke from the vaccine we can
[3:14:22.200 --> 3:14:28.200]  only guess but we're allowed to ask questions and we're allowed to investigate all over the world
[3:14:28.200 --> 3:14:33.320]  vaccine injuries and deaths are piling up hundreds of studies from around the globe report the
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:39.160]  covid vaccine damages the immune system and results in dramatic increases in heart attacks
[3:14:39.160 --> 3:14:45.560]  heart inflammation strokes blood clots cancer and terrible outbreaks of shingles and facial paralysis
[3:14:45.560 --> 3:14:52.120]  liberal hollywood has lopped up the lies misinformation at world class cover up by the
[3:14:52.120 --> 3:14:58.200]  government the media and the cdc like no other group in the world you can't step stage in hollywood
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:03.480]  or anywhere in the entertainment industry without proof of vaccination beaver and his
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:08.680]  wife are the tip of the iceberg soon we'll be seeing and hearing about a tsunami of justin

[3:22:18.200 --> 3:22:24.920]  audio version is out right now and uh i gotta tell you there's some things about my interviews with
[3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:31.080]  trump uh that my own audience my own fans tell me and then i noticed it after they said it to me
[3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:35.880]  see i listen to you and i had so many emails yesterday after listening to my interview
[3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:41.480]  that said you do an interview with trump like no one else the country because it isn't a media
[3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:47.960]  interview it's like we are all let in on a secret conversation between two friends trump and i are very
[3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:53.160]  comfortable with each other and he lets his guard down and talks to me like a friend and i you know
[3:22:53.160 --> 3:22:57.000]  i was there for the first day came down the escalator and i said that's the next president
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:02.120]  united states he was at one percent in the polls at that point and uh and he sent me a note in the
[3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:06.360]  mail and said thank you for the wonderful column you just wrote in fox news saying on the next
[3:23:06.360 --> 3:23:10.440]  president united states i really appreciate it you know you're the greatest way down the route
[3:23:10.440 --> 3:23:16.040]  from that moment on everything i wrote he sent me correspondence handwritten saying how much he
[3:23:16.040 --> 3:23:21.960]  enjoyed it and then sometimes he'd ask me to write certain things write about certain topics uh or
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:26.840]  point them out on my radio or tv interviews and eventually i got my national radio show and eventually
[3:23:26.840 --> 3:23:31.880]  i was the number one host on newsmax tv for three years and over 700 episodes and he would send me
[3:23:31.880 --> 3:23:35.880]  notes and tell me some of the things he wanted me to talk about and some of the things i ought to
[3:23:35.880 --> 3:23:41.960]  investigate and so we became uh kind of pen pals more than anything else he'd send me notes i'd
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:47.640]  send me notes back uh we met on several occasions i was his opening speaker at seven speeches in
[3:23:47.640 --> 3:23:52.760]  las vegas when he ran for president and then his first actually six when he ran for president
[3:23:52.760 --> 3:23:57.240]  and then his first speech back to vegas as president of the united states about a year after
[3:23:57.240 --> 3:24:01.880]  he was elected uh he personally asked his advanced man in the secret service to call me and i should
[3:24:01.880 --> 3:24:07.480]  be the opening speaker for that event in las vegas all of these 10 to 15 000 people in the audience
[3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:12.440]  so it's been a great experience for me getting to know president trump and he started to rely on me
[3:24:12.440 --> 3:24:16.440]  as the vegas odds maker would give him his odds and the and my predictions on whether he'd win
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:20.840]  the election i kept telling me you're gonna win and and he kept saying to me really are you sure
[3:24:20.840 --> 3:24:26.680]  about that i'm gonna beat hillary and i'd say yes and he'd say wow really he just didn't think at
[3:24:26.680 --> 3:24:30.680]  first i don't think he thought he had a chance to win but i think i gave him a lot of confidence
[3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:35.240]  that he'd win and he did win and after that he appreciated it and we've been friends ever since
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:40.920]  i just enjoyed my honeymoon at barilago at his residence so it was a great honor and then
[3:24:40.920 --> 3:24:45.400]  about two weeks later i flew back to florida and gave a speech in palm beach with president trump
[3:24:45.400 --> 3:24:49.960]  it was a wane root president trump's speech and the two of us were on the stage together so
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:54.840]  you know i listen i appreciate the guy he appreciates me and it's a friendship that
[3:24:54.840 --> 3:25:00.360]  leads to these interviews that are very different than your average interview very loose uh let me
[3:25:00.360 --> 3:25:05.320]  tell you over the rest of the show some of the points some of the key points that came out of
[3:25:05.320 --> 3:25:11.320]  my interview with president trump yesterday let's start with number one i am the guy who came up
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:15.960]  with the idea for president trump to be speaker of the house and i'm the guy that believes and has
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:22.360]  been writing about this that america is about to go under that we're not going to make it to 2024
[3:25:22.360 --> 3:25:26.440]  i don't even know that we're going to make it to november that's how bad things are and i asked
[3:25:26.440 --> 3:25:30.840]  president trump about that in the interview as well and you might be interested in his answer
[3:25:30.840 --> 3:25:34.360]  but the more important one is speaker of the house because i believe
[3:25:34.360 --> 3:25:39.960]  that he is the only one that could lead to the impeachment of biden and kamala harris both of
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:44.200]  them and if he does then he's third in line to be president he'd be president united states
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:51.960]  hypothetically so we need him now there's no time to wait to 2024 we cannot wait
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:58.840]  wait so i suggested uh several months ago i guess it was in uh i was probably
[3:25:58.840 --> 3:26:05.080]  april of 2021 i think it was about a year ago a little over a year ago and i said you ought to be
[3:26:05.080 --> 3:26:08.280]  this the speaker of the house run for the speaker house and be the speaker of the house
[3:26:08.840 --> 3:26:14.600]  and uh so on my show yesterday here's the important news and so i know you're showing all these great
[3:26:14.600 --> 3:26:20.120]  scenes of president trump but if you can alec jones producers show me on the screen because i want
[3:26:20.120 --> 3:26:26.680]  to talk to the people one on one now there we go so i said to president trump live you need to be
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:34.200]  speaker of the house and you really i can't believe that you endorsed uh kevin mccarthy a speaker
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:39.400]  you need to be speaker mccarthy will not get the job done and this should be national news and i'll
[3:26:39.400 --> 3:26:43.960]  bet it will be after the media watches me on the alex jones show and then watches my interview
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:50.920]  you trump responded to me and said no no no no no no i never endorsed kevin mccarthy a speaker of
[3:26:50.920 --> 3:26:57.320]  the house i did not endorse kevin mccarthy a speaker of the house i only endorsed kevin mccarthy
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:04.200]  for his run for reelection to his house seat see everyone in america including me watched all the
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:09.480]  headlines trump adores mccarthy and a lot of trump fans got very angry at that i had hundreds of
[3:27:09.480 --> 3:27:15.160]  emails saying your boy trump why is he endorsing mccarthy mccarthy doesn't like him mccarthy
[3:27:15.160 --> 3:27:19.560]  stabs him in the back mccarthy's no good he's not a good house speaker him and mccunnell
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:26.440]  gotta go and i agree well trump said live on national radio no no no no no i did not endorse
[3:27:26.440 --> 3:27:33.640]  kevin mccarthy for house speaker i did not that's not true i only endorsed his reelection for congress
[3:27:33.640 --> 3:27:39.720]  and i said well then you need to be the house speaker you need to run for house speaker and
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:44.600]  let me paraphrase not in front of me the exact words but basically what trump responded was
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:51.560]  okay wane we'll save that one for a private conversation at another time soon you and me
[3:27:51.560 --> 3:27:57.960]  and i thought that was a interesting and shocking answer because what it sounds like he's saying is
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:04.040]  i'm leaving my options open to be speaker of the house no i didn't endorse mccarthy a speaker
[3:28:04.040 --> 3:28:09.400]  and you and i could talk about this in a future time in private maybe he will talk about why you
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:15.400]  will run and why he doesn't want to disclose it now maybe it would affect fec fundraising regulations
[3:28:15.400 --> 3:28:21.400]  or maybe what he'd say to me is i can't run for reason x y and z i've got to help kevin mccarthy
[3:28:21.400 --> 3:28:27.560]  but if that's the case why would he say to me no no no no i did not endorse kevin mccarthy a speaker
[3:28:27.560 --> 3:28:35.560]  i think this is huge national news my idea is still in his mind percolating and he's thinking
[3:28:35.560 --> 3:28:40.600]  about what he might do but first we have to win the house he's not going to say it now
[3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:45.000]  because it might interfere with us winning the house by a massive landslide he's not going
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:50.680]  to say a word till after we win the house but my gut instinct says after this interview that he
[3:28:50.680 --> 3:28:58.520]  likes my idea and he may very well run for speaker of the house that's just susan's new film two

[3:34:32.920 --> 3:34:37.080]  i asked him about becoming a house speaker running for house speaker because we need him
[3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:43.240]  because the country won't survive till 2024 we've got a shortcut to time and his answer was uh you
[3:34:43.240 --> 3:34:48.040]  know and i said and why did you endorse gevin mccarthy as house speaker and his answer was i
[3:34:48.040 --> 3:34:53.160]  didn't endorse kevin mccarthy i never endorsed kevin mccarthy i for house speaker i endorsed him
[3:34:53.160 --> 3:34:58.840]  only for reelection of his house seat that's a major revelation that no one understood until now
[3:34:59.720 --> 3:35:05.640]  and and why would you say that unless you might be actually thinking of running for house speaker
[3:35:05.640 --> 3:35:11.480]  so my hopes are up that trump may be considering that now number two i said that well if that's
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:17.400]  the case then you should run for house speaker and he said that's a private conversation for another
[3:35:17.400 --> 3:35:23.080]  time between you and me what does that mean that's a very interesting revelation i think he's really
[3:35:23.080 --> 3:35:27.720]  considering it and maybe he's holding back till after the midterm elections he's going to play
[3:35:27.720 --> 3:35:31.960]  his cards tight to the vest we're going to win by a landslide and then he's going to announce he's
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:36.760]  running for speaker the house uh if his people look at it from a lot of angles and decide
[3:35:36.760 --> 3:35:41.240]  it's the right thing to do and it makes sense for him and i think it would because he would
[3:35:41.240 --> 3:35:45.160]  leave the impeachment of biden and he would be in the news every day and then he could literally
[3:35:45.160 --> 3:35:49.800]  he could do this in coordination with kevin mccarthy personally i can't stand kevin mccarthy
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:53.480]  personally i think he's the wrong guy he's not a real conservative and he's stabbed trump in the
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:59.080]  back we've got video uh to be audio of him saying terrible things about trump after january 6th
[3:35:59.080 --> 3:36:03.640]  having said that if that's the issue that kevin mccarthy has to be friends with trump
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:08.280]  we got to be partners we can't move forward without his side of the establishment then trump
[3:36:08.280 --> 3:36:13.160]  speaker of the house and he agrees to step down after as soon as the impeachment hearings are over
[3:36:13.160 --> 3:36:17.080]  and maybe at that point his third line he becomes president of the united states so kevin mccarthy
[3:36:17.080 --> 3:36:22.040]  can have his speaker ship back if that's the only way to make this happen but anyway i'm an idea guy
[3:36:22.040 --> 3:36:27.240]  and i throw ideas out and well work some work some don't but it was a great idea and trumps
[3:36:27.240 --> 3:36:30.920]  obviously clearly still thinking about it or he wouldn't have given that answer
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:36.520]  number one number two i brought up bill bar actually i think trump brought up bill bar
[3:36:36.520 --> 3:36:41.560]  excuse me trump in the interview brought up bill bar's name and and i said because we were talking
[3:36:41.560 --> 3:36:47.080]  about the january 6th witch hunt uh the congressional witch hunt and trump mentioned bill bar what
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:52.840]  illusory is and i said listen you know i love you you know i think you're great but man that
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:59.160]  was a lousy pick that was a bad pick from the first day that guy's a rhino he's a bushy you never
[3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:05.160]  should have picked them and shockingly trump said you're right he is a bad guy he is a rhino it was
[3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:13.720]  a big mistake and it wasn't mine it was on advice from someone i trusted that's the summary of what
[3:37:13.720 --> 3:37:18.600]  trump had to say again i'm paraphrasing from memory i don't have the exact words in front of me but
[3:37:18.600 --> 3:37:24.360]  almost word for word he blamed it on someone he trusted that recommended bill bar and i said i knew
[3:37:24.360 --> 3:37:30.280]  from day one he was a rhino and no good there he is he is no good and everything he says about the
[3:37:30.280 --> 3:37:36.440]  election is a lie so i thought that was groundbreaking number three i didn't bring it up he brought up
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:41.640]  in the course of the conversation about january 6th and the witch hunt actually bob it that's the
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:48.600]  air force veteran gal who was killed by a police officer just literally unarmed and not threatening
[3:37:48.600 --> 3:37:53.320]  any violence doing nothing wrong she was shot and killed going through a window that was already
[3:37:53.320 --> 3:37:58.920]  broken along with hundreds of other people and he shot her dead you know what you call that murder
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:05.000]  well trump didn't use the word murder but he came as close as any person in the world could come
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  to saying she was murdered by that capital police officer again it's an opinion show it's my opinion
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:19.560]  trump has an opinion we all believe it was very bad it looked horrible again you get a trial in life
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:24.840]  so he should get a trial he should be indicted for murder he should or manslaughter there should
[3:38:24.840 --> 3:38:29.480]  be a trial and then we'd find out if he's guilty or not and trump said how outrageous that they
[3:38:29.480 --> 3:38:36.200]  covered that up it was so clear that she was shot down in cold blood and nobody did anything about
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:41.560]  i was shocked that trump was basically for all intents and purposes saying what i know and you
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:47.560]  know she was murdered by a police officer you know it's ironic all over america every time a black
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:53.160]  criminal see if a black kid is killed by a cop a white cop or otherwise i'm as outraged as the
[3:38:53.160 --> 3:38:57.560]  rest of everybody else you have no right to kill someone who doesn't deserve who isn't pointing
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:03.640]  a gun at you and isn't shooting that's terrible thing but how about when a white gal is shot by
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:10.920]  a black capital police officer no investigation no argument no debate nobody wants to talk about it
[3:39:10.920 --> 3:39:16.680]  the media doesn't want to cover it was that racist perhaps is it doesn't go both ways is there not
[3:39:16.680 --> 3:39:22.360]  racism on both sides of the aisle so you know ashley babba was shot down by a police officer
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:26.840]  she happened to be white he happened to be black no one said a word about that but when a black
[3:39:26.840 --> 3:39:30.600]  kid gets shot by a white police officer even if he's threatening the white police officer
[3:39:30.600 --> 3:39:36.200]  the whole nation burns rioting looting and murders and attempted murder of police officers
[3:39:36.200 --> 3:39:42.600]  in every major city in america boy talk about one-sided discussions in the media in any case
[3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:49.000]  forget about white or black the important issue is ashley babbot was killed in a way that looks
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:54.760]  like murder or manslaughter that looks like it was never necessary and that someone should go on
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:00.440]  trial for it they never did president trump brought that up i brought up the intentional
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:07.880]  destruction of the united states by the forces and the handlers behind joe biden this is purposeful
[3:40:07.880 --> 3:40:14.040]  this is intentional this is not incompetence this is not a mistake president trump in not so
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:19.560]  exact words agreed with me that it was the intentional destruction of the united states he
[3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:25.640]  said look he said if you want to count intentional as the things they're doing they know they're
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:30.600]  doing them and they're purposely doing them and they're killing america's middle class
[3:40:30.600 --> 3:40:35.080]  and they're making gas prices rise to the roof and they're making the borders open
[3:40:35.080 --> 3:40:39.960]  and bringing in all kinds of criminals that will kill good hardworking americans and take their jobs
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:45.240]  and and you know explode the national debt yes way and then it is intentional destruction
[3:40:45.240 --> 3:40:50.040]  if you want to call it that but it's still incompetence he said because how could you be
[3:40:50.040 --> 3:40:56.440]  so incompetent as to do such terrible things and i said because they're not incompetent this is the
[3:40:56.440 --> 3:41:02.280]  intentional destruction and purposeful destruction of the united states i asked president trump
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:09.080]  about 2024 i said i don't believe we're gonna make it to 2024 and president trump could have said no
[3:41:09.080 --> 3:41:13.720]  no you're wrong everything will be okay this is america no that's not what he said president trump
[3:41:13.720 --> 3:41:19.640]  said i agree with you i think it's a very big question and a very big doubt whether we're
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:26.840]  going to make it to 2024 that's an explosive answer by the former president of the united states
[3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:32.040]  this is not wane root the talk show saying this is the president of the united states agree with me
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:36.680]  that there is a huge question he didn't say like me we're not going to make it to 2024
[3:41:36.680 --> 3:41:43.320]  but he said it is a huge question let's see i actually wrote the quote down it's a huge question
[3:41:43.320 --> 3:41:49.800]  whether we're gonna make it or not to 2024 he said uh um oh and we asked about biden i asked him
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:55.560]  is biden ever gonna run against you in 2024 and president trump said i really doubt it i don't
[3:41:55.560 --> 3:41:59.800]  believe biden will ever run against me i don't believe he'll ever run again and i said i don't
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:05.320]  think the democrat party will ever let him run again and uh and then trump talked about his
[3:42:05.320 --> 3:42:12.360]  doubts his doubts that uh his doubt that we can make it to 2024 big question big doubt he said
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:19.400]  i believe those are the exact words so i he said that's a much bigger question than anything we've
[3:42:19.400 --> 3:42:26.680]  we've talked about today will the country exist in its present form in 2024 and then he said more
[3:42:26.680 --> 3:42:32.920]  bad things have been done in the last year and a half than in the 25 worst years in the history
[3:42:32.920 --> 3:42:40.120]  of america added together so trump is equal with me questioning whether america will exist
[3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:45.800]  in its present form in 2024 or whether the country will collapse under the debt and under
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:43:12.120]  the crime and under the open borders and under all the disasters going on in this country
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:17.400]  is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore
[3:43:17.400 --> 3:43:23.880]  in policy reports and documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they
[3:43:23.880 --> 3:43:31.160]  rule the earth the bilderberg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open

[3:47:15.800 --> 3:47:20.280]  i hope you've enjoyed the revelations about my interview with president donald trump yesterday
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:25.000]  on my national radio show by the way not only are we both relaxed and and you're listening to a
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:30.040]  conversation between two friends but even more important than that i get him because of that
[3:47:30.040 --> 3:47:34.040]  friendship more than any other host i believe in the united states america i don't think anybody's
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:39.080]  had trump as often as i got him four times in the last year every three months i've got trump as
[3:47:39.080 --> 3:47:43.320]  my guest so i don't know that the hennedys the world the levins of the world i don't know that
[3:47:43.320 --> 3:47:49.080]  anybody has ever gotten trump every three months like i do but i'm very proud and honored that he
[3:47:49.080 --> 3:47:55.080]  loves to join me let's talk about the last two remaining points i have to make about this interview
[3:47:55.080 --> 3:48:01.240]  first of all we both agreed about the january 6 congressional hearing it's a show trial i said
[3:48:01.240 --> 3:48:06.680]  there's a communist attack on the united states and you could see it all around you look at peter
[3:48:06.680 --> 3:48:12.600]  navarro i said you know that was trump's former top official and assistant to the president united
[3:48:12.600 --> 3:48:18.920]  states and head of all trade negotiations peter navarro went to china and negotiated the trade
[3:48:18.920 --> 3:48:23.800]  deal with china you know there's no one more important american business in the whole country
[3:48:23.800 --> 3:48:28.360]  than the president united states and peter navarro and they arrested him in handcuffs and
[3:48:28.360 --> 3:48:34.200]  lake shackles and stuck him in a prison cell this is beyond anything that's ever happened
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:41.240]  in the history of america this is russia this is nazi this is communist china and i said to trump
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:47.160]  who's next first they took peter navarro who's next you are they going to take you in shackles
[3:48:47.160 --> 3:48:52.600]  from marilago and so you know again you'll have to listen to the interview but trump said you know
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:59.240]  all of this is part and parcel of a show trial uh or i said a communist show trial he actually
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:05.640]  said his exact words were a witch hunt and a kangaroo court and he mentioned how there's nobody
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:12.040]  on his side on the panel it's like having a trial for murder and and the prosecution is able to
[3:49:12.040 --> 3:49:17.080]  make their case and on the other side is nobody there's no defense attorney on the other side
[3:49:17.080 --> 3:49:21.640]  there isn't one republican congressman on the committee that cares about trump
[3:49:21.640 --> 3:49:26.760]  there's only two republicans on the committee everyone else the democrat and the two republicans
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:33.800]  are liz cheney and adam kidzinger who both hate trump with such a passion that i'm guessing again
[3:49:33.800 --> 3:49:38.600]  the opinion show and it's my opinion those two are members card-carrying members of the communist
[3:49:38.600 --> 3:49:44.840]  party of china those two are so out to get trump they would lynch him on a tree if they could
[3:49:44.840 --> 3:49:51.560]  they're like taking orders from the communist party of china the ccp what an outrage again
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:57.960]  my opinion opinion show they exhibit everything about them makes them sound like they are owned
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:50:04.120]  by the deep state the dc swamp george soros claus Schwab of the world economic forum and don't
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:09.080]  forget the chinese communist party everything these people do is to hurt trump and make sure
[3:50:09.080 --> 3:50:13.800]  he can never be president again for those of you who doubt that trump should be president you're mad
[3:50:13.800 --> 3:50:18.360]  at him over the vaccines as an example and i get it i've always said to trump it's only one thing
[3:50:18.360 --> 3:50:22.600]  in the world let's disagree with you on the vaccines the vaccines are horrible they're terrible
[3:50:22.600 --> 3:50:26.520]  they're injuring people they're killing people and you think they're great well you and i disagree
[3:50:26.520 --> 3:50:31.480]  on that but that's it on everything else in the world and the economy uh we're in a foreign affairs
[3:50:31.480 --> 3:50:36.440]  and national defense we're in agreement he did a great job on everything and even on that one
[3:50:36.440 --> 3:50:41.640]  he did a great job he didn't invent the vaccines that's not his job he's not a scientist he's not
[3:50:41.640 --> 3:50:47.640]  dr. Fauci he's not head of the cdc he simply was a field general who made sure the vaccines were
[3:50:47.640 --> 3:50:53.000]  created in record time that no one thought possible so we could all get back to the business he didn't
[3:50:53.000 --> 3:50:59.160]  know there was an evil dr. evil in the background creating a a death vax that would kill and injure
[3:50:59.160 --> 3:51:06.520]  so many people under the guise of protecting you from a flu that had a 99.95 percent chance of you
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:12.040]  being healthy in three or four days nobody ever needed the vaccine they needed ivermectin they
[3:51:12.040 --> 3:51:17.720]  needed hydroxchloroquine again it's an opinion show it's my opinion studies prove ivermectin
[3:51:17.720 --> 3:51:24.360]  hydroxchloroquine kill covid quickly but let's not say kill they're very effective against covid the
[3:51:24.360 --> 3:51:30.680]  most effective drugs we've ever seen against covid throw in vitamin c vitamin d zinc and quercetin
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:36.440]  and you got an incredible formula for everyone to use and they never needed the vaccine to take
[3:51:36.440 --> 3:51:42.280]  that incredible risk of death that that vaccine's giving you and so uh he believes the kangaroo
[3:51:42.280 --> 3:51:46.520]  court jeduary 6 he believes the witch hunt i believe the same thing i added that there's a
[3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:50.920]  communist takeover the united states and that's why i call this a show trial like you'd see in a
[3:51:50.920 --> 3:51:56.200]  communist country i also mentioned solid linsky in my interview with trot but he said yes yes
[3:51:56.200 --> 3:52:00.760]  i said solid linsky wrote rules for radicals and rules for radicals said look in the mirror
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:06.360]  and whatever you see blame the other guy blame your opponent for what you're doing
[3:52:06.360 --> 3:52:12.360]  and that's what they're doing with this show trial they know they are the traders they know
[3:52:12.360 --> 3:52:18.600]  they've already uh what what do they call the uh january 6 they called it a insurrection they
[3:52:18.600 --> 3:52:24.760]  committed the insurrection the insurrection was the stolen election they stole the election
[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:32.120]  and they stole our country it was a coup and an insurrection so they made january 6 a peaceful
[3:52:32.120 --> 3:52:38.120]  protest look like a coup and an insurrection now they're charging it's a coup and an insurrection
[3:52:38.120 --> 3:52:42.200]  and the greatest lawyer in the history of the world alex dirshowitz who's a regular guest on my
[3:52:42.200 --> 3:52:46.840]  show just said the other day go ahead and try trump on all those charges there's not one thing
[3:52:46.840 --> 3:52:53.240]  he did that is a crime not one there's nothing you can get him on so and finally the last
[3:52:53.240 --> 3:53:00.040]  observation i'll make about my trump interview is if you listen to it he sounds more deflated
[3:53:00.040 --> 3:53:06.040]  than usual i won't use the word depressed i'll use the word deflated and i'm just reading into
[3:53:06.040 --> 3:53:10.200]  this because president trump you know you and i didn't have a private conversation off the air
[3:53:10.200 --> 3:53:15.480]  i have no idea if it's true it's my opinion and i'm an opinion commentator i believe
[3:53:15.480 --> 3:53:21.480]  that president trump is deflated as i am as enthusiastic and high energy and positive
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:27.720]  as i am my whole life i'm deflated right now because i see my country being destroyed in
[3:53:27.720 --> 3:53:32.440]  front of me at his record speed the likes of which no one has ever seen remember i wrote
[3:53:32.440 --> 3:53:37.400]  the biden blitzkrieg because i compared the speed at which he's destroying america to the
[3:53:37.400 --> 3:53:43.320]  nazi blitzkrieg that took over europe and he compared to the holocaust don't send any organizations
[3:53:43.320 --> 3:53:49.160]  after me to say i'm comparing it to the holocaust i'm comparing it to the speed at which the hitlers
[3:53:49.160 --> 3:53:55.400]  nazi army took over europe there is an absolute comparison to be made for the speed at the of
[3:53:55.400 --> 3:54:02.200]  the destruction of america right now and trump sees what i see again my opinion and he's deflated
[3:54:02.200 --> 3:54:07.880]  because it never should have happened he was the president he was reelected they stole the
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:13.960]  election from him and therefore stole not only his place in history but his chance to make america
[3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:21.080]  truly great again and they're making america poor again mappa the democrat party is making america
[3:54:21.080 --> 3:54:25.720]  poor again they're making us into the poorest country in the world what did trump call all those
[3:54:25.720 --> 3:54:31.400]  other countries crap holes i'm saying it nicely he used a different word with a sh at the start
[3:54:31.400 --> 3:54:36.920]  but let's call them crap holes central america filled with crap holes mexico nice people but
[3:54:36.920 --> 3:54:43.160]  crap hole heady crap hole these countries are crap holes in bob way's a crap hole almost every
[3:54:43.160 --> 3:54:48.120]  nation in africa is a crap hole america is the greatest nation in the world people have such
[3:54:48.120 --> 3:54:54.760]  great lives here they're trying to drag us down and turn us into one of those crap holes ironically
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:55:00.120]  that all those people from those countries are running away from to come to america and they're
[3:55:00.120 --> 3:55:04.440]  willing to break it illegally because it's so great here and the streets are paved with gold
[3:55:04.440 --> 3:55:11.080]  they're trying to make us into those crap holes so trump is seeing that like i am and he is deflated
[3:55:11.080 --> 3:55:16.360]  that someone's got to do something yet legally there's almost nothing we can do other than vote
[3:55:16.360 --> 3:55:21.800]  and voting isn't going to cut it voting alone isn't going to save us we're not going to make it to
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:28.680]  2024 just because we win an election in 2022 november and by the way there's no guarantee we're
[3:55:28.680 --> 3:55:36.760]  going to win a landslide in november either because they rig elections so all i could tell you is i
[3:55:36.760 --> 3:55:42.600]  believe in that interview that my friend donald j trump was deflated and is deflated just as i
[3:55:42.600 --> 3:55:47.880]  am deflated after you see my excitement of my high energy and all that other stuff i must tell you i
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:54.680]  am deflated what are we gonna do the only answer i have at this point is to vote and to vote them
[3:55:54.680 --> 3:55:58.840]  out and to win at a gigantic landslide and the other only other answer i've got which i've
[3:55:58.840 --> 3:56:04.120]  found this show is we need a divorce divorce american style remember that famous movie the
[3:56:04.120 --> 3:56:09.560]  set uh tv series in the 70s marriage american style this is or love american style this is
[3:56:09.560 --> 3:56:15.560]  divorce american style blue states have got to go their own way separate and reds uh and red states
[3:56:15.560 --> 3:56:20.520]  have to go their own way separate and we got to get away from these crazy people they're suicide
[3:56:20.520 --> 3:56:27.400]  bombers they're kamikaze's they're domestic terrorists again solinsky democrats are the
[3:56:27.400 --> 3:56:33.240]  domestic terrorists and they accuse us of being domestic terrorists they burned the country down
[3:56:33.240 --> 3:56:39.240]  with blm and antifa they destroyed two billion in property they killed policemen they tried to
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:44.920]  murder thousands of policemen they killed many many people murder rate was up dramatically in 2020
[3:56:44.920 --> 3:56:50.360]  and yet they accuse us of being domestic terrorists because we don't want to take a vaccine because
[3:56:50.360 --> 3:56:54.680]  we don't like critical race theory and we go to pta meetings and complain about it we're domestic
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:57:00.040]  terrorists do you see it's solid linsky look in the mirror and blame the other guy for everything
[3:57:00.040 --> 3:57:05.160]  you're really doing that was russian collusion they're the ones that tried to steal the election
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:09.800]  they're the ones that rigged the election they're the ones that spied on trump like communists
[3:57:09.800 --> 3:57:14.840]  and yet they accused us of russian collusion it's all solid linsky rules for radicals i'm
