[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information that's powerful and I hope
[00:10.000 --> 00:16.480]  that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had chills since
[00:16.480 --> 00:17.480]  last night.
[00:17.480 --> 00:21.000]  It just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.880]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed,
[00:27.880 --> 00:32.440]  mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other
[00:32.440 --> 00:33.440]  documents.
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.160]  But this dev tells of all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to
[00:37.160 --> 00:41.040]  sterilize you with the forced vaccines and the hell we're already living in.
[00:41.040 --> 00:45.080]  This is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics
[00:45.080 --> 00:46.080]  madmen.
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.600]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:48.600 --> 00:52.120]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:52.120 --> 00:55.920]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:55.920 --> 01:00.760]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're
[01:00.760 --> 01:11.560]  producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast.
[01:11.560 --> 01:19.040]  The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines for children
[01:19.040 --> 01:22.800]  as young as six months old.
[01:22.800 --> 01:27.560]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.840]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[01:32.840 --> 01:37.320]  We now know, based on rigorous scientific review, that the vaccines available here in
[01:37.320 --> 01:42.920]  the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[01:42.920 --> 01:47.760]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization
[01:47.760 --> 01:49.600]  and death from COVID-19.
[01:49.600 --> 01:55.800]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[01:55.800 --> 02:02.400]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know
[02:02.400 --> 02:11.480]  is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[02:11.480 --> 02:16.960]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors
[02:16.960 --> 02:19.560]  of mRNA technology.
[02:19.560 --> 02:26.160]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths, and yet
[02:26.160 --> 02:33.080]  we are still being lied to by our own government who wants us to sacrifice our youngest children.
[02:33.080 --> 02:37.120]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[02:37.120 --> 02:39.200]  I have some really exciting news.
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.720]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under five.
[02:44.720 --> 02:46.920]  These vaccines are incredibly safe.
[02:46.920 --> 02:49.920]  They work to prevent serious illness.
[02:49.920 --> 02:54.560]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated, and now if you're a parent of
[02:54.560 --> 02:59.040]  a kid under five, it's a great time to go out and get your child protected.
[02:59.040 --> 03:01.280]  Get them vaccinated.
[03:01.280 --> 03:08.120]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which
[03:08.120 --> 03:10.680]  we know is a lie.
[03:10.680 --> 03:16.120]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.640]  vaccine in history.
[03:19.640 --> 03:28.280]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death, there is a well-documented
[03:28.280 --> 03:38.640]  risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys, and severe blood clotting in young women.
[03:38.640 --> 03:45.600]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[03:45.600 --> 03:51.280]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more
[03:51.280 --> 03:57.080]  vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[03:57.080 --> 04:03.520]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response
[04:03.520 --> 04:14.480]  to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[04:14.480 --> 04:20.560]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[04:20.560 --> 04:27.200]  The UK reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the US is seeing a 20%
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.720]  increase in deaths and a 10% increase in disability.
[04:33.720 --> 04:39.160]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing
[04:39.160 --> 04:43.960]  just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[04:43.960 --> 04:51.240]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[04:51.240 --> 05:18.560]  Coming for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:18.560 --> 05:46.920]  We have
[05:46.920 --> 06:12.440]  a
[06:12.440 --> 06:31.960]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[06:31.960 --> 06:47.960]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:47.960 --> 06:54.080]  Bill Biden, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all the usual suspects are telling us that a new pandemic
[06:54.080 --> 07:03.520]  and lockdowns are imminent as the world plunges into financial crisis via hyperinflation.
[07:03.520 --> 07:08.960]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this live, Wednesday, June 22nd, worldwide broadcast.
[07:08.960 --> 07:13.200]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, very pleased and honored to be back in this chair.
[07:13.200 --> 07:18.440]  I want to say, great job, the crew, Owen Schreuer, and of course others, while I have been out
[07:18.440 --> 07:24.080]  of town, I've been back for days, dealing with just the finances to keep this operation
[07:24.080 --> 07:29.560]  on air, because all small companies, and we're not a business to be a business, but we're
[07:29.560 --> 07:35.440]  a business to fund ourselves, using capitalism to exercise the First Amendment and freedom,
[07:35.440 --> 07:39.640]  are under absolute attack, not just this operation, but the entire country.
[07:39.640 --> 07:46.040]  We have a lot of very important news on that front and the next leg of the great reset that
[07:46.040 --> 07:51.400]  our enemies have planned for us, and how to stop that, and so much more today.
[07:51.400 --> 07:55.800]  But as I sit here, looking at all this incredible news, I ask myself, what is the most important
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.160]  news item out there?
[07:57.160 --> 08:03.440]  Well, there's all the symptoms of the disease that is the new world order and globalism.
[08:03.440 --> 08:05.840]  And so the big question is, how do we tackle globalism?
[08:05.840 --> 08:08.320]  How do we expose globalism?
[08:08.320 --> 08:11.280]  How do we dismantle and prosecute globalism?
[08:11.280 --> 08:13.960]  The greatest tyranny humans have ever seen.
[08:13.960 --> 08:19.120]  And separately, how do we recognize the fruits of globalism to wake up our friends, family,
[08:19.120 --> 08:24.520]  neighbors, and strangers, so they understand why their lives are getting very bad, why
[08:24.520 --> 08:27.440]  crime is increasing, why they're going bankrupt?
[08:27.440 --> 08:33.640]  We're going to be discussing it all here today, and I intend at the bottom of the hour to
[08:33.640 --> 08:38.480]  give the number out and take calls today, but I'm going to be very specific, and we're
[08:38.480 --> 08:44.720]  going to screen your calls today and ask that you call in on the specific subject that I'm
[08:44.720 --> 08:49.080]  about to lay out, which is, how do we defeat the globalist?
[08:49.080 --> 08:53.560]  That's a huge, giant subject, go a thousand different directions with.
[08:53.560 --> 08:55.840]  How do we defeat the new world order?
[08:55.840 --> 08:59.280]  And then currently, what is the worst thing they're doing?
[08:59.280 --> 09:03.080]  What is the number one thing they're doing that we need to stop?
[09:03.080 --> 09:12.800]  Defunding the currencies, defunding the police, dissolving the borders, coming after our guns,
[09:12.800 --> 09:22.280]  launching war with Russia, preparing to release new bio weapons, but you know they're not
[09:22.280 --> 09:28.120]  really preparing to release new bio weapons, they are releasing new bio weapons, or targeting
[09:28.120 --> 09:40.480]  a new group of people with their bio nanotech weapon, and that is babies, six months old
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.600]  and up.
[09:42.600 --> 09:49.720]  The corrupt FDA had three different rounds of resignations, firings, off their board
[09:49.720 --> 09:54.520]  the last year and a half, because the board would not even authorize, authorizing these
[09:54.520 --> 09:59.520]  experimental injections for anybody, so they had one board resign, or large portions of
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.280]  it, then they got new people on and said now we're going to go down to age 16 and a bunch
[10:03.280 --> 10:11.040]  of them said no, now we're going to add boosters and shots every few months, no.
[10:11.040 --> 10:17.440]  And now they had more board members resign, and they've got a board now that unanimously
[10:17.440 --> 10:22.600]  voted to lie to the public and say that this works great, that it's a vaccine and that
[10:22.600 --> 10:25.000]  it totally protects you.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.160]  When it isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system, causes all
[10:29.160 --> 10:37.920]  sorts of serious problems, and doesn't protect you.
[10:37.920 --> 10:45.720]  Absolute organized evil depopulation against the people of this planet.
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.440]  Outrageous, you know, some stations don't carry the first little five minute segment
[10:49.440 --> 10:53.360]  we do every day, but a lot of them do, but I'm going to be re-airing, coming up later
[10:53.360 --> 10:58.920]  in the hour, a short four minute report by Greg Rees, and all of his reports are pivotal
[10:58.920 --> 11:05.960]  and critical, this one particularly, establishment loyalists manipulated into sacrifice in their
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.480]  own children.
[11:07.480 --> 11:13.880]  When I was on a workcation to the West Coast and other areas, I talked to many nurses and
[11:13.880 --> 11:18.360]  doctors in the airport and on the street.
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.280]  Who told me the same thing we see in the news, the same thing we hear from callers, the same
[11:24.280 --> 11:32.600]  thing we experience in our own lives, about how at the hospital, in one particular case
[11:32.600 --> 11:40.480]  talking to a registered nurse who's a grandma, been a nurse for more than three decades,
[11:40.480 --> 11:48.920]  and she said, multiple doctors got sick from the shots, and one of the main doctors, 12
[11:48.920 --> 11:53.880]  year old son took the shot and had to have heart ablation, something a 70 year old man
[11:53.880 --> 11:57.920]  would get, carterizing his heart, because his heart was beating at a resting level of
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.600]  160 beats per minute and was in danger of a heart attack, and it was directly from the
[12:02.600 --> 12:08.440]  shot and he said, no, it's not from the shot, I don't care, and they have shortages, not
[12:08.440 --> 12:14.160]  just from the people that they ran off that wouldn't take the shot, she was so senior
[12:14.160 --> 12:19.000]  they didn't get rid of her, she didn't take it, her husband works there too, but they
[12:19.000 --> 12:23.280]  have massive shortages at this one big hospital, she told me the name of it, I'm not gonna
[12:23.280 --> 12:34.160]  say it, because so many of the staff were sick from the injections, this is massive,
[12:34.160 --> 12:41.600]  this is huge, and the question is, what are we gonna do about it?
[12:41.600 --> 12:49.280]  I mean, how crazy is this gonna get before we find sanity, and thank God, Governor DeSantis
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.720]  came out and said, how dare Biden target babies with this, when no babies have died of COVID,
[12:54.720 --> 12:58.880]  and little children don't even really get sick from it, why are they doing this?
[12:58.880 --> 13:01.960]  Because they're targeting them to sterilize them.
[13:01.960 --> 13:07.360]  We know the shots reduce fertility, sterilize many people, we know that it annihilates immune
[13:07.360 --> 13:15.720]  systems and will turn these children into invalids if they even survive, so good for
[13:15.720 --> 13:23.120]  DeSantis, but here's Biden chillingly saying a new pandemic is coming and he's reading
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.040]  out the same script as Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and others here at us.
[13:26.040 --> 13:31.480]  At least this year, we do need more money, but we don't just need more money for vaccines
[13:31.480 --> 13:35.960]  for children eventually, we need more money to plan for the second pandemic, there's
[13:35.960 --> 13:40.960]  gonna be another pandemic, we have to think ahead, and that's not something the last outfit
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.800]  did very well, that's something we've been doing for fairly well, that's why we need
[13:44.800 --> 13:46.600]  the money.
[13:46.600 --> 13:54.040]  We need the money to create a biomedical tyranny in a world ID system that's now all been announced,
[13:54.040 --> 13:59.080]  and we've got all the other little satanic parents up there saying the exact same thing,
[13:59.080 --> 14:06.960]  because the general public cannot get it through their heads that they are under attack by
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.640]  these monsters, but that is exactly what's going on.
[14:11.640 --> 14:15.840]  So as I said, I'm gonna open the phones up, not yet, please don't call yet, it's a computer
[14:15.840 --> 14:21.600]  system, we gotta flip it on, but at the bottom of the hour, at 30 after, we're gonna flip
[14:21.600 --> 14:30.480]  that computer on, a digital phone system, and we're gonna open the phones up for first
[14:30.480 --> 14:36.840]  time callers to give you a chance in the first round, after that everybody can call in, on
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.000]  how do we defeat the New World Order, and what is the most evil thing they're doing
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.640]  right now, because we all know it's one of our concerns ever to collapse civilization,
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.520]  but what is the most wicked thing they're doing right now that we can focus on and expose
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.200]  and try to stop the New World Order?
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.560]  That's the issue, I'll be giving the number out coming up in about 13, 14 minutes, we'll
[14:58.560 --> 15:02.880]  take a lot of your phone calls today, Leo Zagami is gonna be popping in for the first
[15:02.880 --> 15:08.120]  30 minutes of the third hour, he's the Vatican expert that predicted everything that's happened
[15:08.120 --> 15:12.880]  so far, he predicted the last pope with a resign, he predicted the next pope with a
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.200]  resign, and I'll say that's imminent, what does that really politically mean, that's
[15:17.200 --> 15:22.800]  such a political office, it's a big deal geopolitically, we'll be discussing that coming up, some
[15:22.800 --> 15:28.680]  in the third hour today, but the first hour and second hour, we're gonna play a ton of
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.080]  clips, go over a ton of big news stories, and I'm gonna give you my breakdown of what
[15:33.080 --> 15:37.360]  I think is coming next and how to stop this nightmare situation, there's also been a lot
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.880]  of vindication that's happened, and we're gonna hit that information on the other side,
[15:41.880 --> 15:46.240]  because it shows how right you've been, how right I've been, how right we've been, and
[15:46.240 --> 15:52.760]  where this is all going, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, band.videos where the censored

[18:59.160 --> 19:09.840]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[19:09.840 --> 19:16.480]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[19:16.480 --> 19:17.480]  lost.
[19:17.480 --> 19:22.800]  Just like you're lost to sleep, you're lost in a bad nightmare, you're in a car, you get
[19:22.800 --> 19:30.800]  knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused,
[19:30.800 --> 19:31.800]  you have a concussion.
[19:31.800 --> 19:35.200]  And that's what the globalists have done, they have stunned us.
[19:35.200 --> 19:40.160]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings, and then Klaus Schwab recently
[19:40.160 --> 19:44.200]  came out and gave speech, he called the great new narrative, where he brags how the public
[19:44.200 --> 19:45.200]  is lost.
[19:45.200 --> 19:50.040]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they
[19:50.040 --> 19:53.000]  can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.520]  That's what the great reset is.
[19:54.520 --> 19:56.000]  They need darkness to thrive.
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.680]  The light lives at infowars.com.
[20:00.680 --> 20:16.600]  Meeting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:16.600 --> 20:30.640]  It's psychology, and if you're not aware of how the human mind works, you will be absolutely
[20:30.640 --> 20:36.040]  defenseless against the enemies of humanity.
[20:36.040 --> 20:38.840]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:38.840 --> 20:46.920]  The social engineers know that if they do horribly evil things and nobody engages in
[20:46.920 --> 20:51.960]  leadership and opposes them and challenges them, the general public will just buy the
[20:51.960 --> 20:58.480]  official stories and let the very abusers carrying out the attacks pose as the saviors
[20:58.480 --> 21:03.880]  to then get even more power and more control and carry out their goal of depopulation.
[21:03.880 --> 21:07.920]  And it's scary to admit that these COVID shots aren't vaccines.
[21:07.920 --> 21:11.840]  It's scary to admit they're killing us, that all the actuaries and numbers from insurance
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.400]  companies show that.
[21:13.400 --> 21:16.000]  It's horrifying to know you're living in the middle of this.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.120]  I'm a pretty strong guy, and I have real trouble.
[21:19.120 --> 21:23.720]  If I didn't have faith in God, I couldn't do it.
[21:23.720 --> 21:28.080]  So I know why people have trouble dealing with this because it's just too horrible for
[21:28.080 --> 21:32.640]  their minds to even face or deal with.
[21:32.640 --> 21:37.000]  But let's talk about some of the things we were right about that just came out in the
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  last week.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[21:39.000 --> 21:40.960]  Got picked up all over the world.
[21:40.960 --> 21:48.720]  WHO chief quote believes COVID did leak from the Wuhan lab, says the European Union, but
[21:48.720 --> 21:51.360]  they're afraid of what the public will do if they learn that.
[21:51.360 --> 21:53.720]  Well, we know it came from the lab.
[21:53.720 --> 21:54.720]  They had records.
[21:54.720 --> 21:55.720]  They made it.
[21:55.720 --> 21:56.720]  They had records.
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.720]  They released it.
[21:57.720 --> 21:58.720]  They had records.
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.360]  They approached the Pentagon about releasing it.
[22:01.360 --> 22:06.960]  It's a nanotech virus, genetically engineered chimeric.
[22:06.960 --> 22:09.640]  And now that's all admitted.
[22:09.640 --> 22:13.800]  And of course, all these big publications came out and groups said, Alex Jones was right.
[22:13.800 --> 22:20.560]  Our water supply is poisoned with deadly chemicals, says Michael Knowles and others over there
[22:20.560 --> 22:25.360]  at the Daily Wire, a huge operation they've got going in Tennessee.
[22:25.360 --> 22:30.880]  And what did the Environmental Protection Agency say last week?
[22:30.880 --> 22:40.560]  They said, my goodness, best for you in LA and the plastic liners of soda cans and juice
[22:40.560 --> 22:48.200]  boxes feminizes boys and hyperfeminizes women.
[22:48.200 --> 22:50.040]  It makes girls who want to puberty early.
[22:50.040 --> 22:55.880]  It makes boys not become masculine and it gives you cancer.
[22:55.880 --> 23:01.160]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones was not right.
[23:01.160 --> 23:07.200]  The science has been on record for more than 40 years that they chose the formulas for
[23:07.200 --> 23:08.200]  the plastics.
[23:08.200 --> 23:10.520]  They've got a bunch of clean plastics.
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.520]  They chose these plastics that would cause this and would do this.
[23:16.520 --> 23:20.280]  People go out that have been smart for decades and buy glass bottles for their babies.
[23:20.280 --> 23:24.560]  They drink out of glass because they don't trust plastic.
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.920]  There's a whole bunch of plastics that don't leach anything on record.
[23:29.920 --> 23:37.560]  But they put plastics in products like microwavable trays that have plastic lining that are basically
[23:37.560 --> 23:48.680]  bisphenol A and give you a massive dose of sterilant for men and hyperfeminization for
[23:48.680 --> 23:51.840]  women that doesn't make women look like Marilyn Monroe.
[23:51.840 --> 23:56.920]  It makes them look like bloated ogreuses.
[23:56.920 --> 24:00.440]  You ever walked around the shopping mall and at least you're old enough to remember and
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.840]  you're like, man, since when are the girls taller than the boys?
[24:04.840 --> 24:09.720]  And it goes into the hormones and the endocrine disruptors and the studies.
[24:09.720 --> 24:15.280]  So when I tell you all this, there are tens of thousands of studies from every major prestigious
[24:15.280 --> 24:21.280]  university and medical facility you can imagine knowing all of this and they've done it by
[24:21.280 --> 24:26.240]  design.
[24:26.240 --> 24:30.560]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.960]  Here's a Fox News headline.
[24:32.960 --> 24:38.280]  Forever chemicals in water and packaging can risk health, EPA says, and it goes into what
[24:38.280 --> 24:39.280]  it does.
[24:39.280 --> 24:45.640]  Washington Post's EPA warns toxic forever chemicals more dangerous than once thought.
[24:45.640 --> 24:52.280]  See they know this is all coming out, so they start getting ahead of it and acting like
[24:52.280 --> 24:53.280]  they didn't know.
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.040]  Oh, we didn't know 5G caused massive cancer.
[24:57.040 --> 25:01.400]  Oh, we didn't know these chemicals did that.
[25:01.400 --> 25:06.920]  And the whole microplastic subject is a whole other issue.
[25:06.920 --> 25:14.160]  Suddenly in Europe, suddenly in the US, government agencies are constantly testing blood and other
[25:14.160 --> 25:21.560]  tissue samples are reporting unprecedented for the first time microplastics in the blood
[25:21.560 --> 25:24.920]  and in the tissue of humans everywhere.
[25:24.920 --> 25:28.160]  Well what happened?
[25:28.160 --> 25:31.840]  Starting two years ago in a global program directed by the World Economic Forum, they
[25:31.840 --> 25:38.960]  brag about it, they got authorization from the different regulatory agencies around the
[25:38.960 --> 25:47.800]  world to spray your food with trackable plastic nanoparticles, and I've been showing you those
[25:47.800 --> 25:53.920]  headlines for a while, but go to the EPA's own website, go to the FDA's own website,
[25:53.920 --> 26:04.560]  and the FDA and the EPA say we have no jurisdiction over microplastics and nanotech, just type
[26:04.560 --> 26:12.280]  in the headline, nanotech now being sprayed on US food supply, and you will get government
[26:12.280 --> 26:15.920]  websites telling you they're doing it.
[26:15.920 --> 26:22.880]  And then you can play a clip of Yuval Harari last year saying we're putting micro nanotech
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.080]  in your food and water to take over your body, this is our revolution, the end of humans
[26:28.080 --> 26:29.080]  is here.
[26:29.080 --> 26:35.280]  There's the Journal of Food and Drug Analysis, the current application of nanotechnology in
[26:35.280 --> 26:45.080]  food and in agriculture, that's from four years ago, there's USDA, nanotechnology can
[26:45.080 --> 26:49.520]  be used in food production enhanced taste, color, flavor, texture, consistency of a variety
[26:49.520 --> 26:55.440]  of foods.
[26:55.440 --> 27:01.360]  So this has been going on for at least a decade, but it's accelerated the last four or five
[27:01.360 --> 27:05.920]  years, and this is a takeover.
[27:05.920 --> 27:13.000]  The COVID shots create a matrix in the body that begins growing nanotech using your cell's
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.480]  own resources to do this.
[27:20.480 --> 27:25.600]  And then you wonder why, and we should put a video together of this, Stephen Colbert,
[27:25.600 --> 27:31.640]  CNN, ABC News, the other nighttime host, all of them were given talking points in the last
[27:31.640 --> 27:38.600]  decade to attack me and say, Jones is crazy, he claims the liner in juice boxes are making
[27:38.600 --> 27:41.680]  your boys feminine.
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.280]  Jones claims there's nanotech, Jones claims you're being attacked to your food and water,
[27:46.280 --> 27:52.960]  to make it about Alex Jones, instead of actually showing the real studies, oh that's not studies
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.360]  saying it, it's just Alex Jones.
[27:57.360 --> 28:03.080]  Now who do these people work for, why are they doing this, I'll leave that up to you
[28:03.080 --> 28:09.840]  to figure out, it's pretty obvious, the folks that aren't very pro-human, they have a group
[28:09.840 --> 28:14.600]  of people that have signed on to it saying the post-human era is here, looking forward
[28:14.600 --> 28:22.080]  to the end of humanity, these are real headlines, Wall Street Journal, NBC News, and that's just
[28:22.080 --> 28:28.600]  the further vindication of everything we warned you about, what we told you about right there.
[28:28.600 --> 28:35.600]  The toll-free number to join us on two subjects, two subjects, how do we stop the globalists,
[28:35.600 --> 28:41.680]  what's the most evil thing they're up to in doing, those are the subjects we're covering,
[28:41.680 --> 28:54.400]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539, your calls, well we come back straight
[28:54.400 --> 28:59.920]  ahead and so much more.
[28:59.920 --> 29:05.760]  The internet and talk radio are on fire, with the slogan, Alex Jones is right, people ask
[29:05.760 --> 29:10.120]  what's it like to be vindicated, well it's actually a very sick feeling because I knew
[29:10.120 --> 29:16.040]  this was coming, I tried to stop it, and now everything I've talked about is going to become
[29:16.040 --> 29:22.200]  more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[29:22.200 --> 29:24.680]  documents, it's now out in the open.
[29:24.680 --> 29:30.320]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[29:30.320 --> 29:36.200]  Group, so now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know
[29:36.200 --> 29:39.960]  they're behind schedule, we're going to win this thing, God's watching the children counting
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.640]  on us, I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your
[29:43.640 --> 29:47.640]  prayer and your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here,
[29:47.640 --> 29:52.000]  so I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[29:52.000 --> 29:56.280]  reason humanity has a fighting chance, so I want to thank you and salute you again for
[29:56.280 --> 29:59.880]  all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[29:59.880 --> 30:04.400]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very
[30:04.400 --> 30:12.760]  carefully, the Nestist is made the most important documentary in US history, 2000 mules, that's
[30:12.760 --> 30:19.560]  not hype, that's the truth, the film proves how the deep state democrats stole the 2020
[30:19.560 --> 30:22.400]  election and how they're planning to do it again.
[30:22.400 --> 30:27.600]  Now ladies and gentlemen with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with
[30:27.600 --> 30:31.640]  the expanded extras so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you
[30:31.640 --> 30:36.240]  can show it to your church, your business, your neighbors or just perfect strangers.
[30:36.240 --> 30:42.440]  We have the film available, ready to ship to you right now at infowarstore.com and we
[30:42.440 --> 30:47.480]  also have it discounted when you get other films like covidland part one, two or three

[30:51.800 --> 30:58.520]  and so much more at infowarstore.com, get 2000 mules by the Nestist Susan now at infowarstore.com
[30:58.520 --> 31:06.640]  I'm a humble person and I want to say that I'm just a man, but I'm not just a man, just
[31:06.640 --> 31:10.960]  like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, you were made by
[31:10.960 --> 31:16.520]  the creator of the universe, who had a plan for you, who has a destiny for you, that's
[31:16.520 --> 31:21.120]  why the system hates you and fears you and that's why they hate me, it's because spirit
[31:21.120 --> 31:27.520]  I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and will and love, my friends the
[31:27.520 --> 31:32.360]  enemy is coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner, they're
[31:32.360 --> 31:37.360]  coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person, because
[31:37.360 --> 31:43.240]  you love God and God loves you and so I signed up for this, I signed up for this fight and
[31:43.240 --> 31:47.080]  I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer, but I can't fight this fight without you and that's
[31:47.080 --> 31:51.360]  why I want you to always remember that I appreciate you and I thank you because infowarstore is
[31:51.360 --> 31:56.240]  your fight, infowarstore is your baby, it's the thing you built, we did this together,
[31:56.240 --> 31:59.920]  so God bless you all, let's keep fighting.
[31:59.920 --> 32:05.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, high quality, storeable food is back in stock, ready to ship right
[32:05.080 --> 32:09.560]  now, we've not been selling food for three months because it was taking several weeks
[32:09.560 --> 32:13.280]  for the food to get packaged and delivered to you, most of their companies are completely
[32:13.280 --> 32:18.520]  out, but now they have a large spectrum of high quality food, ready to ship, everything
[32:18.520 --> 32:25.560]  you find at preparewithalix.com or preparetoday.com is in stock, ready to ship, so go to preparewithalix.com
[32:25.560 --> 32:30.160]  or preparetoday.com and order your high quality, storeable food right now, ready to ship to
[32:30.160 --> 32:31.160]  you and your family.
[32:31.160 --> 32:34.960]  With the inflation happening, with the food shortages, with the wars, with the collapse
[32:34.960 --> 32:38.560]  and wars, everything's happening, is one of the most important things you can make is
[32:38.560 --> 32:42.400]  to have high quality, storeable food, water filtration, air filtration and more and it's
[32:42.400 --> 32:46.400]  not just those items, it's hundreds of other high quality, preparedness items and survival
[32:46.400 --> 32:53.000]  items right now at preparewithalix.com that again redirects to preparetoday.com.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important things you can do
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.760]  is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[33:00.760 --> 33:12.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.760 --> 33:20.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups, you want to stop tyranny?
[33:20.600 --> 33:38.840]  Yo so does he, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:38.840 --> 33:46.280]  The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines for children
[33:46.280 --> 33:48.880]  as young as six months old.
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.800]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[33:54.800 --> 34:00.080]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.560]  We now know, based on rigorous scientific review, that the vaccines available here in
[34:04.560 --> 34:10.160]  the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[34:10.160 --> 34:15.000]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  and death from COVID-19.
[34:17.000 --> 34:23.040]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[34:23.040 --> 34:29.640]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know
[34:29.640 --> 34:38.680]  is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[34:38.680 --> 34:44.200]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors
[34:44.200 --> 34:46.960]  of mRNA technology.
[34:46.960 --> 34:52.840]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths.
[34:52.840 --> 34:59.160]  And yet, we are still being lied to by our own government who wants us to sacrifice our
[34:59.160 --> 35:00.320]  youngest children.
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.360]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[35:04.360 --> 35:06.440]  I have some really exciting news.
[35:06.440 --> 35:11.960]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under five.
[35:11.960 --> 35:14.160]  These vaccines are incredibly safe.
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.160]  They work to prevent serious illness.
[35:17.160 --> 35:20.680]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated.
[35:20.680 --> 35:24.680]  And now if you're a parent of a kid under five, it's a great time to go out and get
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.520]  your child protected, get them vaccinated.
[35:28.520 --> 35:35.360]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which
[35:35.360 --> 35:37.920]  we know is a lie.
[35:37.920 --> 35:43.320]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other
[35:43.320 --> 35:46.840]  vaccine in history.
[35:46.840 --> 35:55.480]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death, there is a well-documented
[35:55.480 --> 36:05.840]  risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys and severe blood clotting in young women.
[36:05.840 --> 36:12.800]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[36:12.800 --> 36:18.480]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more
[36:18.480 --> 36:24.200]  vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[36:24.200 --> 36:30.600]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response
[36:30.600 --> 36:42.000]  to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[36:42.000 --> 36:48.120]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.800]  The U.K. reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the U.S. is seeing
[36:53.800 --> 37:01.280]  a 20 percent increase in deaths and a 10 percent increase in disability.
[37:01.280 --> 37:06.720]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing
[37:06.720 --> 37:11.520]  just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.800]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[37:18.800 --> 37:42.080]  Waiting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[37:42.080 --> 37:47.520]  I don't normally play a report twice a day, much less twice an hour, but it's just so
[37:47.520 --> 37:49.800]  short, so powerful, so documented.
[37:49.800 --> 37:54.400]  For a radio listener, you hear him talking about the different pieces of information,
[37:54.400 --> 37:56.480]  the report for TV viewers.
[37:56.480 --> 37:59.520]  Everything is an article, everything is a document.
[37:59.520 --> 38:04.680]  Establishment loyalists manipulated into sacrificing their own children, or at least
[38:04.680 --> 38:06.520]  they tell you their kids are taking the shots.
[38:06.520 --> 38:07.520]  Don't believe that.
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.280]  For a minute, the report is at theinfowar.tv.
[38:12.280 --> 38:14.680]  That's the URL that takes you to Band-Aid Video.
[38:14.680 --> 38:19.040]  Band-Aid Video URL is blocked on Twitter, Instagram, everywhere else, but the new URL
[38:19.040 --> 38:22.640]  they're not censoring yet is theinfowar.tv.
[38:22.640 --> 38:29.600]  Save some lives, defeat the globalists in the Info War, go to theinfowar.tv or Band-Aid
[38:29.600 --> 38:34.200]  Video and share with everyone you know.
[38:34.200 --> 38:38.480]  Okay.
[38:38.480 --> 38:43.760]  I'm sitting here looking at hundreds of clips and incredible announcements and war news
[38:43.760 --> 38:46.920]  and economy news and so many things I want to get to.
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.600]  I'm also going to start taking your phone call, start of the next segment, but I'm going
[38:50.600 --> 38:53.480]  to go ahead and do this right now.
[38:53.480 --> 38:58.600]  There is a lot of news out there attacking Info Wars, a lot of control corporate press.
[38:58.600 --> 39:04.800]  I'm more demonized than any other media figure in modern history.
[39:04.800 --> 39:08.560]  Trump is more demonized than me, but I'm a close second.
[39:08.560 --> 39:11.360]  And it's important to know why that is.
[39:11.360 --> 39:17.720]  They fear populism, they fear people waking up, they fear leadership, they fear the truth.
[39:17.720 --> 39:23.560]  And it's very important if they can shut us down and silence us or curtail us, then they
[39:23.560 --> 39:32.240]  can create a false Alex Jones, a straw man, and they can demonize the populist movement
[39:32.240 --> 39:34.480]  by demonizing that straw man.
[39:34.480 --> 39:41.880]  They can use Info Wars and the fake straw man they've created as a mobilizer for their
[39:41.880 --> 39:42.880]  people.
[39:42.880 --> 39:47.560]  A great example of this is whether you liked Benjamin Netanyahu or were neutral on him
[39:47.560 --> 39:55.360]  or didn't like him, unified dislike of him got him out of office.
[39:55.360 --> 40:01.720]  Now that Benjamin Netanyahu is gone, that coalition has fallen apart and that government
[40:01.720 --> 40:09.200]  broke up and fell yesterday and today, and he'll probably be back in.
[40:09.200 --> 40:10.440]  And it's the same thing.
[40:10.440 --> 40:16.320]  They don't like Trump because he's a unifier of the populist movement, but it could also
[40:16.320 --> 40:19.440]  be used to energize opposition.
[40:19.440 --> 40:25.360]  Well, Info Wars is good at unifying populists against tyranny, but if you can silence Info
[40:25.360 --> 40:30.440]  Wars and then misrepresent what Info Wars is, you can use it as a weapon against the
[40:30.440 --> 40:31.440]  people.
[40:31.440 --> 40:35.320]  That's why I can't just say, hey, hang up my spurs.
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.880]  I've already warned everybody.
[40:36.880 --> 40:38.520]  We've already done all this.
[40:38.520 --> 40:45.120]  My work is done because they will then misrepresent who we are and use the false Alex Jones they
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.280]  create as this media creature to destroy the liberty movement.
[40:50.280 --> 40:52.520]  And that's why it's so critical.
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.520]  We stay in the fight.
[40:53.520 --> 40:56.520]  So I'm going to go to break, come back, play some of these key clips and go to your calls.
[40:56.520 --> 40:58.680]  Let me just say this now.
[40:58.680 --> 41:03.120]  I try to bring you products that I use that I think are great to stay on air.
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.880]  And we got some big Bitcoin donations in the last three months that I thought actually
[41:07.880 --> 41:11.680]  put us into the black quite a bit that we did further accounting, brought in some outside
[41:11.680 --> 41:17.800]  accounts, looked at everything projected forward with product price increases, supply chain
[41:17.800 --> 41:18.800]  problems.
[41:18.800 --> 41:22.240]  And they said, man, it's like God did this.
[41:22.240 --> 41:30.280]  The money that came in was exactly what you needed to just go into the black and pay off
[41:30.280 --> 41:39.640]  past bills and buy enough product to just continue on another three, four, five months.
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.480]  And so I want to thank everybody that's bought products and info or short.com want to think
[41:43.480 --> 41:47.800]  whoever it is that made those big giant Bitcoin donations because we would have been insolvent
[41:47.800 --> 41:49.280]  and imploding right now without you.
[41:49.280 --> 41:50.280]  You saved them for worse.
[41:50.280 --> 41:51.280]  You did that.
[41:51.280 --> 41:52.280]  That was historic.
[41:52.280 --> 41:53.280]  Thank you.
[41:53.280 --> 41:54.280]  That was money we'll spend.
[41:54.280 --> 41:57.760]  But I want to encourage everybody to go to info or short.com.
[41:57.760 --> 42:05.880]  We're about to have to end the ultimate immune support package with four of our bestselling
[42:05.880 --> 42:13.160]  products, vitamin D three gummies, the multivitamin X two and the immune support.

[42:23.080 --> 42:27.800]  for 50% off and we have X two by itself for 40% off.
[42:27.800 --> 42:34.920]  Two of the products are about to sell out.

[42:38.160 --> 42:41.920]  If you want to get up to 60% off on those and boost your immune system with all the

[43:02.600 --> 43:07.640]  witnessed the globalist hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard.

[43:13.480 --> 43:17.760]  and your families to the greatest extent possible and these two new sales do that.

[44:00.840 --> 44:10.840]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[44:10.840 --> 44:17.960]  France, but the general public is in the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[44:17.960 --> 44:22.600]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car, I can get
[44:22.600 --> 44:30.760]  knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused
[44:30.760 --> 44:31.760]  because you have a concussion.
[44:31.760 --> 44:33.600]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[44:33.600 --> 44:34.600]  They have stunned us.
[44:34.600 --> 44:39.960]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[44:39.960 --> 44:40.960]  came out and gave him speech.
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.480]  He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture
[44:45.480 --> 44:50.560]  in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide
[44:50.560 --> 44:52.720]  humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[44:52.720 --> 44:54.240]  That's what the great reset is.
[44:54.240 --> 44:55.240]  They need darkness to thrive.
[44:55.240 --> 45:11.040]  The light lives at nfowars.com William, in California, people are asleep
[45:11.040 --> 45:12.360]  and programmed controlled.
[45:12.360 --> 45:13.360]  I agree.
[45:13.360 --> 45:14.360]  How do you make the sleeper?
[45:14.360 --> 45:15.360]  I can, William.
[45:15.360 --> 45:16.360]  Hi, Alex.
[45:16.360 --> 45:17.360]  Thanks for taking my call.
[45:17.360 --> 45:18.360]  Can I plug, uh, Alex real quick?
[45:18.360 --> 45:19.360]  Yeah, go ahead.
[45:19.360 --> 45:24.920]  Hey, I'm in my sixties, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30 year olds and I worked them
[45:24.920 --> 45:29.680]  into the ground and you wanted a Y and I've tested this and I've taken your B12 and let
[45:29.680 --> 45:32.480]  me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[45:32.480 --> 45:33.480]  I really do.
[45:33.480 --> 45:36.560]  I take that B12 and I'm electric, man.
[45:36.560 --> 45:37.800]  I can run 10 miles.
[45:37.800 --> 45:42.840]  I do some pretty heavy work, uh, with a highway department and my friends will attest to the
[45:42.840 --> 45:48.840]  fact that, yeah, for a guy in his sixties, you know, pushing 70, I'm, and I'm not just
[45:48.840 --> 45:59.800]  blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[45:59.800 --> 46:04.400]  Every single person listening to the sound of my voice needs to listen to me very, very
[46:04.400 --> 46:05.400]  carefully.
[46:05.400 --> 46:12.680]  The Nestos is made the most important documentary in the U.S. history, 2000 mules.
[46:12.680 --> 46:14.240]  That's not hype.
[46:14.240 --> 46:15.400]  That's the truth.
[46:15.400 --> 46:21.040]  The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[46:21.040 --> 46:22.040]  to do it again.
[46:22.040 --> 46:27.520]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with
[46:27.520 --> 46:31.520]  the expanded extra so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you
[46:31.520 --> 46:36.160]  can show it to your church, your business, your neighbors, or just perfect strangers.
[46:36.160 --> 46:42.600]  We have the film available, ready to ship to you right now at infowarstore.com and we also
[46:42.600 --> 46:47.480]  have a discounted when you get other films like covidland part one, two, or three that
[46:47.480 --> 46:48.680]  just came out.
[46:48.680 --> 46:54.480]  There's discounts to get in game for global enslavement and so much more at infowarstore.com.
[46:54.480 --> 47:00.360]  Get 2000 mules by the next to Susan now at infowarstore.com.
[47:00.360 --> 47:14.120]  Using a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.480]  All right, we're about to be taking your phone calls on the specific topics of how do we
[47:18.480 --> 47:23.480]  defeat the globalist and what is the most evil project they've got going right now
[47:23.480 --> 47:25.160]  against humanity.
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.760]  I want to get your take on that and so much more with Joe, Mike, Joe, Mark, Tony, Noah,
[47:30.760 --> 47:38.040]  Digital Dave, John, Jay, Derek, and others here today on this live June 22, Wednesday
[47:38.040 --> 47:39.040]  broadcast.
[47:39.040 --> 47:44.280]  But first, Alex Morrier is a very successful filmmaker in her own right.
[47:44.280 --> 47:47.640]  She works with some other great filmmakers as well.
[47:47.640 --> 47:53.120]  I've said no to a lot of documentary film crews to basically cover infowarstores.
[47:53.120 --> 47:56.720]  It's just a distraction, they're almost always hit pieces.
[47:56.720 --> 48:01.280]  But she did, I think, a fair job and did a really powerful entertaining film.
[48:01.280 --> 48:08.440]  It's about two hours long and it's going to come out in late July.
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.200]  And there's some big heavy hitters have seen it and are going to be endorsing it and pushing
[48:13.200 --> 48:14.200]  it and promoting it.
[48:14.200 --> 48:16.040]  I had nothing to do with this.
[48:16.040 --> 48:17.040]  But it's very interesting.
[48:17.040 --> 48:19.320]  Just wait for that in the next month.
[48:19.320 --> 48:26.240]  You'll see what I'm talking about very, very soon that this film has a lot of backing and
[48:26.240 --> 48:28.200]  it's not just a one-sided Alex Jones Lovefest.
[48:28.200 --> 48:29.440]  I think it's very, very fair.
[48:29.440 --> 48:31.440]  It actually brought some tears to my eyes.
[48:31.440 --> 48:34.680]  But here's the first trailer that dropped today.
[48:34.680 --> 48:38.680]  If you want to share the trailer, it's posted on infowarst.com.
[48:38.680 --> 48:45.280]  And then Scott Adams, the well-known artist, cartoonist and pundit, he had some of his
[48:45.280 --> 48:46.800]  own analysis dealing with it.
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.520]  And so we're going to play the trailer and then Scott Adams comments back to back.
[48:51.520 --> 48:52.520]  I'm Alex Jones.
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.800]  The story you're about to see is truth.
[48:54.800 --> 48:55.800]  This is reality.
[48:55.800 --> 48:58.800]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[48:58.800 --> 49:03.400]  I'm the most banned, most demonized media person in the world.
[49:03.400 --> 49:04.400]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[49:04.400 --> 49:05.800]  And he's a performance artist.
[49:05.800 --> 49:10.000]  I'm perceived as a clown, a nut, a maniac.
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.640]  On his website, info wars, he touts Aaron Neuerborn, the sickest, most offensive
[49:16.640 --> 49:17.640]  theories.
[49:17.640 --> 49:23.120]  Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[49:23.120 --> 49:25.120]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[49:25.120 --> 49:27.120]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.120]  Ain't that something?
[49:30.120 --> 49:31.960]  You're burning hell.
[49:31.960 --> 49:33.960]  I met him back in 1990.
[49:33.960 --> 49:36.200]  I knew right away he was going to be a star.
[49:36.200 --> 49:37.200]  How's my look?
[49:37.200 --> 49:40.320]  I saw all these conspiracy theorists that were talking about the New World Order.
[49:40.320 --> 49:42.320]  And I thought, that's what I'll do.
[49:42.320 --> 49:43.320]  Hey, Alex.
[49:43.320 --> 49:44.320]  Yeah!
[49:44.320 --> 49:45.320]  The New World Order.
[49:45.320 --> 49:49.040]  I got an attack on humanity I saw early on that I really wanted to waste war on.
[49:49.040 --> 49:50.040]  You're lying to the public.
[49:50.040 --> 49:51.040]  It's disgusting.
[49:51.040 --> 49:55.960]  When she tastes that, there's no going back.
[49:55.960 --> 49:56.960]  Everything's a war.
[49:56.960 --> 49:57.960]  And that's the way the universe works.
[49:57.960 --> 49:58.960]  And everything is propaganda.
[49:58.960 --> 50:00.960]  I don't trust Donald Trump.
[50:00.960 --> 50:04.920]  But I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says.
[50:04.920 --> 50:06.680]  Your reputation's amazing.
[50:06.680 --> 50:09.680]  I will not let you down.
[50:09.680 --> 50:12.160]  That's what the media loves off.
[50:12.160 --> 50:16.920]  Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children, was fake.
[50:16.920 --> 50:19.200]  I try to tell the truth, and sometimes I'm wrong.
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.640]  Did the New York Times get in trouble for consciously lying about WMDs that then led
[50:23.640 --> 50:24.640]  to a war?
[50:24.640 --> 50:26.640]  Killed tens of thousands in conflict?
[50:26.640 --> 50:27.640]  No.
[50:27.640 --> 50:29.640]  The attempts to be platformers have failed.
[50:29.640 --> 50:32.320]  They had the CIA, the FBI following me around.
[50:32.320 --> 50:34.120]  Now we've got to destroy Alex Jones.
[50:34.120 --> 50:35.120]  We're not playing games here.
[50:35.120 --> 50:38.120]  This is such a historic moment together.
[50:38.120 --> 50:39.120]  USA!
[50:39.120 --> 50:40.120]  USA!
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  It's all just insane.
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.000]  Okay, let's put me in prison for questioning, okay, even though that's my right.
[50:46.000 --> 50:47.680]  In fact, let's execute Alex Jones.
[50:47.680 --> 50:50.600]  Let's put him in front of a firing squad and pull the trigger.
[50:50.600 --> 50:59.120]  I have a sick feeling, actually, because I know what comes next.
[50:59.120 --> 51:05.840]  I just looked at a little trailer for that, and you see just a snippet of Alex Jones defending
[51:05.840 --> 51:06.840]  what he does.
[51:06.840 --> 51:14.920]  Now, his defense is this, that he believes what he says to be true, and that sometimes
[51:14.920 --> 51:17.920]  he's wrong.
[51:17.920 --> 51:26.920]  And I looked at that, and I think, maybe, maybe, you can't really rule that out, can
[51:26.920 --> 51:27.920]  you?
[51:27.920 --> 51:29.600]  I mean, think about it.
[51:29.600 --> 51:35.200]  Think about how easy a target Alex Jones is, and then I'm going to give you his defense.
[51:35.200 --> 51:36.200]  It's really simple.
[51:36.200 --> 51:39.040]  It's a very simple defense.
[51:39.040 --> 51:43.640]  He believes what he says, but sometimes he's wrong.
[51:43.640 --> 51:49.480]  And I hear that, and I think, all right, nobody has ever presented evidence that he doesn't
[51:49.480 --> 51:51.440]  believe what he says.
[51:51.440 --> 51:54.360]  Am I wrong?
[51:54.360 --> 51:55.920]  And then here's the second part.
[51:55.920 --> 51:58.840]  Here's the mic drop.
[51:58.840 --> 52:05.480]  Alex Jones asks us, why would we treat him differently than the New York Times, which
[52:05.480 --> 52:11.280]  also presumably believes what it says, but sometimes they're wrong, like weapons of mass
[52:11.280 --> 52:18.360]  destruction in Iraq, like really wrong, like wrong start of war wrong, like that's as
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.200]  wrong as you can be.
[52:20.200 --> 52:23.080]  And Alex Jones says, why would you treat me differently?
[52:23.080 --> 52:32.720]  We both believe what we said, and we both could be wrong, to which I say, oh, shit,
[52:32.720 --> 52:36.640]  that's actually a complete defense.
[52:36.640 --> 52:39.920]  There's nothing wrong with that defense at all.
[52:39.920 --> 52:45.720]  The only way he could be thwarted in that defense is if there's some recording of him
[52:45.720 --> 52:49.760]  saying, I make all this stuff up.
[52:49.760 --> 52:56.120]  Now apparently there is some evidence that he likes the conspiracy theory domain.
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.400]  So that part I think he said directly.
[52:58.400 --> 53:02.120]  I believe that's also part of the trailer.
[53:02.120 --> 53:09.280]  But that doesn't mean he doesn't believe it.
[53:09.280 --> 53:11.520]  But all you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[53:11.520 --> 53:15.120]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself.
[53:15.120 --> 53:20.880]  And Tucker Carlson, everywhere, every day, Jones admits he's an actor.
[53:20.880 --> 53:24.600]  Or Tucker Carlson says, nobody would take me seriously.
[53:24.600 --> 53:25.600]  Where did we say that?
[53:25.600 --> 53:26.600]  We never said that.
[53:26.600 --> 53:30.000]  They just say we said that.
[53:30.000 --> 53:31.120]  But where's the clip?
[53:31.120 --> 53:32.240]  Where's the article?
[53:32.240 --> 53:33.240]  Where do we say that?
[53:33.240 --> 53:34.240]  It doesn't exist.
[53:34.240 --> 53:39.800]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[53:39.800 --> 53:47.160]  And it's all based on a custody battle of my ex-wife five years ago.
[53:47.160 --> 53:50.800]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before like
[53:50.800 --> 53:56.520]  the Joker being sarcastic saying, take your Prozac kids, take your illegal drugs too.
[53:56.520 --> 53:57.520]  You'll die.
[53:57.520 --> 53:58.520]  It's fun.
[53:58.520 --> 54:02.120]  People wouldn't take drugs, and they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[54:02.120 --> 54:03.120]  They look.
[54:03.120 --> 54:04.960]  He's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[54:04.960 --> 54:10.120]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's
[54:10.120 --> 54:11.200]  really Jack Nicholson.
[54:11.200 --> 54:18.320]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander or Optimus Prime or the Joker, because I can
[54:18.320 --> 54:24.320]  do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader, do I really think I'm Darth
[54:24.320 --> 54:25.320]  Vader?
[54:25.320 --> 54:26.320]  No.
[54:26.320 --> 54:27.320]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[54:27.320 --> 54:28.600]  Cobra Commander, the Joker?
[54:28.600 --> 54:29.600]  No.
[54:29.600 --> 54:35.000]  And clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying
[54:35.000 --> 54:36.760]  is what I really think.
[54:36.760 --> 54:38.600]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[54:38.600 --> 54:39.880]  It's not trying to lie to you.
[54:39.880 --> 54:43.480]  It's being sarcastic.
[54:43.480 --> 54:46.840]  But they play those games.
[54:46.840 --> 54:49.560]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[54:49.560 --> 54:51.440]  Even though I tell people, OK, this is a joke.
[54:51.440 --> 54:52.600]  This isn't serious.
[54:52.600 --> 54:56.640]  They clip it out, and they say, no.
[54:56.640 --> 54:59.280]  This is what he really believes.
[54:59.280 --> 55:00.280]  And they go, look.
[55:00.280 --> 55:01.280]  He admitted in court.
[55:01.280 --> 55:02.280]  He's an actor.
[55:02.280 --> 55:03.280]  Well, yeah.
[55:03.280 --> 55:04.360]  I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[55:04.360 --> 55:05.960]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.760]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[55:10.760 --> 55:15.760]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to
[55:15.760 --> 55:19.240]  you isn't a real thing, and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[55:19.240 --> 55:20.680]  And you know that.
[55:20.680 --> 55:21.680]  You're insulted right now.
[55:21.680 --> 55:23.360]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[55:23.360 --> 55:24.360]  And so am I.
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.960]  And that's who these people are.
[55:28.960 --> 55:31.720]  Megatron prepare to die.
[55:31.720 --> 55:35.640]  Autobots transform and roll out.
[55:35.640 --> 55:41.320]  I was sent to your appointment to save it from Megatron.
[55:41.320 --> 55:42.320]  That's me having fun.
[55:42.320 --> 55:48.920]  I don't actually believe I'm Optimus Prime or Cobra.
[55:48.920 --> 55:51.960]  I'm not actually Cobra Commander or the Joker.
[55:51.960 --> 55:56.720]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.080]  And my mother is Carol Jones, and my dad is David Jones, and my sister is Marley Jones.
[56:02.080 --> 56:04.160]  And I am an American.
[56:04.160 --> 56:13.440]  And that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[56:13.440 --> 56:17.480]  I find you're like a face disturbing.
[56:17.480 --> 56:23.800]  Find me, and I will complete your training.
[56:23.800 --> 56:28.120]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[56:28.120 --> 56:31.080]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[56:31.080 --> 56:39.240]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what
[56:39.240 --> 56:45.680]  I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola
[56:45.680 --> 56:51.800]  on infowars.com that has all the sighted information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult
[56:51.800 --> 56:52.800]  death syndrome?
[56:52.800 --> 56:56.440]  No, that's a real thing.
[56:56.440 --> 57:02.400]  That's something happening in the real world.
[57:02.400 --> 57:04.200]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[57:04.200 --> 57:06.400]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[57:06.400 --> 57:08.560]  I'll get to your phone calls next hour.
[57:08.560 --> 57:12.760]  Please stand by, looking forward to talking to every single one of you about the big
[57:12.760 --> 57:15.240]  questions we've asked her today.
[57:15.240 --> 57:20.560]  How do we defeat the globalists, and what is the most evil project they've got going
[57:20.560 --> 57:21.560]  on?
[57:21.560 --> 57:22.560]  Is it the geoengineering?
[57:22.560 --> 57:23.840]  Is it the imploding borders?
[57:23.840 --> 57:24.840]  Is it virus releases?
[57:24.840 --> 57:28.120]  Is it the transgender movement targeting our children?
[57:28.120 --> 57:32.480]  Is it the legalization of pedophilia, the push to do it?
[57:32.480 --> 57:35.320]  Is it the push to give these deadly injections to children?
[57:35.320 --> 57:36.960]  Well, there's not a push.
[57:36.960 --> 57:38.920]  It's happening now.
[57:38.920 --> 57:44.240]  What is the big issues so we can identify it and mobilize against it and defeat it?
[57:44.240 --> 57:45.240]  Over to Straight Ahead.
[57:45.240 --> 57:46.240]  Stay with us.
[57:46.240 --> 57:54.240]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old, and it goes like this.
[57:54.240 --> 57:57.040]  Trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[57:57.040 --> 57:59.040]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[57:59.040 --> 58:01.280]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[58:01.280 --> 58:05.200]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[58:05.200 --> 58:06.200]  and killed.
[58:06.200 --> 58:07.200]  But also, try to row away.
[58:07.200 --> 58:11.360]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish, and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[58:11.360 --> 58:13.440]  God helps those who help themselves.

[59:10.640 --> 59:13.200]  is already unfolding with global food shortages.
[59:13.200 --> 59:17.480]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[59:17.480 --> 59:22.440]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork, and I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot
[59:22.440 --> 59:23.440]  worse.
[59:23.440 --> 59:24.440]  They have designed this.
[59:24.440 --> 59:29.920]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.

[59:47.440 --> 59:50.440]  Take action.
[59:50.440 --> 1:00:09.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:14.280]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this June 22,
[1:00:14.280 --> 1:00:22.040]  Wednesday broadcast, we are going to be taking your phone calls coming up next segment, but
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:29.080]  I want to just get back to Greg Reese's report with the FDA board, the fourth board they've
[1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:34.920]  created, the other boards wouldn't do it, to not just give children the shots, but babies
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:37.160]  unsolved and older, these deadly shots.
[1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:43.520]  I'm going to play a clip coming up here in a moment that deals with all of this with
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:48.160]  Steve Kirsch, because it's so important to understand that even if you believe they're
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:54.560]  cooked statistics, this is not protecting people.
[1:00:54.560 --> 1:01:02.240]  It's erasing their immune systems, it's causing very, very serious health problems.
[1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:09.360]  And if they can get away with this, they believe they can get away with anything.
[1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:15.400]  So we're going to play clip 19 here in just a minute or so with Steve Kirsch, the great
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:21.440]  investigative journalist, he says, so you've killed 150,000, that's a conservative number,
[1:01:21.440 --> 1:01:26.040]  that's what they admit, in order to maybe save 10,000 lives.
[1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:32.440]  Many people died in the vaccine group in the first placebo group, and it takes 22,000 vaccines
[1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:35.520]  to save one life from COVID.
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.560]  But it's about testing how many of us can they kill?
[1:01:40.560 --> 1:01:46.880]  It's about testing what can they get away with?
[1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.040]  How dumb are we?
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:50.200]  Can they start depopulating us?
[1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.240]  Can they launch the next pandemic?
[1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.600]  Can they launch stuff way worse than COVID, which was a real attack?
[1:01:55.600 --> 1:01:59.720]  If you have your minerals and vitamins and stuff, you're basically protected all the
[1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:01.920]  evidence shows.
[1:02:01.920 --> 1:02:08.480]  So that's where we are dealing with all this, and we're all being tested right now to see
[1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:09.480]  what we will accept.
[1:02:09.480 --> 1:02:12.440]  You know, I think that's the most important thing to say.
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:13.680]  How did you defeat the globalists?
[1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:17.680]  You realize you're being tested to see what you'll put up with, and you expose them and
[1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:21.480]  you mobilize against them, and you say no to them, and you boycott them, and you run
[1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:22.480]  for office.
[1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:26.640]  It doesn't matter if you're a city council member or a mayor or a governor or a legislator
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:32.760]  or in Congress, the world's looking for leadership right now to defend against this and stop
[1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:33.760]  it.
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:36.960]  So we've got this clip of Steve Kerch, we'll come back from break, put a clip of Governor
[1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:42.440]  DeSantis, and I promise the full hour, your phone calls, and then Leo Zagami pops in and
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:45.400]  we'll go back to your phone calls, but here's the report.
[1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:51.360]  Now we all know in the Pfizer trial that was published in the medical literature that more
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:59.960]  people died who got the vaccine than who got the placebo.
[1:02:59.960 --> 1:03:04.560]  In other words, the vaccine killed more people than the placebo did.
[1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:07.680]  Now it's not supposed to work that way for a vaccine, right?
[1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:12.240]  Vaccines are supposed to save lives, but in fact in the clinical trial, more people died
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:18.480]  who got the drug than who didn't get the drug, and the reason is because that the clinical
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:26.840]  trial showed that you could save one life for every 22,000 people who got the drug
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:28.480]  from COVID.
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:35.000]  However, more people died who got the drug because they died from different reasons.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.160]  They died from the vaccine.
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:41.760]  But see, everybody is focused on how many lives we can save from COVID, and they're
[1:03:41.760 --> 1:03:46.280]  not focused on how many deaths were caused by the vaccine.
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.400]  So I did a calculation.
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:53.160]  Well, it turns out that when you save one person for every 22,000 people you inject,
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:59.600]  it means we could have saved that the vaccines have saved 10,000 lives over the course of
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:00.600]  a year.
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:01.600]  10,000 lives.
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:04.800]  Now three million people die every year.
[1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:06.880]  You just saved 10,000 lives.
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:07.880]  Congratulations.
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.440]  That's rounding error.
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:18.120]  We turned this country upside down to save just 10,000 lives, but we actually didn't
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:23.960]  save 10,000 lives because when you look at the VAERS numbers and you look at it 12 different
[1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:28.400]  ways that didn't even use VAERS, you come up with at least 150,000 people who have been
[1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:30.400]  killed by the vaccine.
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:32.320]  There's no other explanation.
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:38.520]  So you killed 150,000 in order to maybe save 10,000 lives.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:45.160]  And that's if the actual variant matched the vaccine, which it doesn't.
[1:04:45.160 --> 1:04:51.880]  So in other words, and for kids, by the way, the risk benefit is even worse.
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:05:21.720]  You kill 117 kids to save one life.
[1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:28.920]  So you kill 120,000 in order to save our lives.
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:32.780]  Can you feel like Hugam점 funny?
[1:05:32.780 --> 1:05:33.860]  Of course.
[1:05:33.860 --> 1:05:41.180]  If you have said that you've got more sadly injured victims, it's obvious, but you know
[1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:41.920]  they did not have enough injured victims.
[1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:44.400]  So this would be the best scene to make the?!?
[1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:46.520]  No, no, that's not right now.
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:51.280]  not be here. So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the Infowars and you
[1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:55.620]  are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again
[1:05:55.620 --> 1:06:21.620]  for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:06:21.620 --> 1:06:36.820]  So the White House is lying about it. We are surprised. Not surprised the White House
[1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:41.500]  would lie. Definitely not surprised that legacy media would amplify the lie because
[1:06:41.500 --> 1:06:45.460]  that's what they do. The state of Florida, they came out with an article saying the state
[1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:50.420]  of Florida has not ordered, its Department of Health has not ordered mRNA jabs for
[1:06:50.420 --> 1:06:55.780]  the babies. Yes, we didn't. We recommend against it. We are not going to have any programs
[1:06:55.780 --> 1:07:06.540]  where we're trying to jab six-month-old babies with mRNA. That's just the reality.
[1:07:06.540 --> 1:07:11.900]  And I think what happened was they thought somehow we would be embarrassed by that.
[1:07:11.900 --> 1:07:17.780]  No, we're following the data. You look at these European countries. A lot of them don't
[1:07:17.780 --> 1:07:22.500]  even allow Moderna for under age 30 or they recommend against it. So that was always that.
[1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:26.500]  We still have not ordered it. We're not going to order it. Now what they're saying is because
[1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:31.500]  practitioners and hospitals can order it. Somehow we've reversed. I said from the beginning
[1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:35.700]  they'll be able to do that. We don't have the authority to prevent it. And quite frankly,
[1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:40.420]  if someone wants to make a different decision, I would just caution people, look at the actual
[1:07:40.420 --> 1:07:47.820]  data in the clinical trial. It is the weakest possible data that you could possibly see.
[1:07:47.820 --> 1:07:54.020]  Very small number of people. What the recommendation is from them doesn't even track the outcomes.
[1:07:54.020 --> 1:07:58.620]  It was something that... But people can ask their pediatricians. They can ask their doctors.
[1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:02.900]  What's the evidence of protection against severe disease? There was none in the clinical
[1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:08.900]  trial. But that's something that people would do. But for us, Joe Lattapo, our Department
[1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:16.180]  of Health has looked at it. There is no proven benefit to put a baby with an MNRA. So that's
[1:08:16.180 --> 1:08:20.660]  why our recommendation is against it. That's different than prohibiting the use in Florida,
[1:08:20.660 --> 1:08:25.420]  which we don't have the authority to do. And quite frankly, we're confident people can
[1:08:25.420 --> 1:08:29.420]  make their own judgments on it. But I would say when you look at the trial, one of the
[1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:34.580]  things they did, they did not have babies or very young kids who had recovered from COVID
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:39.460]  in the trial. So we don't know what this will do for people that have recovered. But in
[1:08:39.460 --> 1:08:46.300]  their recommendation, they are recommending giving the mRNA shot to people, young babies
[1:08:46.300 --> 1:08:50.820]  and kids that have already recovered from COVID. They don't have any clinical data on
[1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:55.140]  that. And people have looked at some of this stuff and have recognized how that... And you
[1:08:55.140 --> 1:09:00.300]  know what? The White House is bragging that we're the only country that is trying to do
[1:09:00.300 --> 1:09:05.180]  mRNA shots for infants. And I'm just thinking to myself, well, wait a minute, there's nothing
[1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:11.100]  wrong with being the lone ranger, if you're right. But the other countries in Europe that
[1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:15.020]  are going a different direction, similar to the direction Florida's gone, they have been
[1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:20.860]  right on COVID way more than Fauci and his crew have been throughout this whole thing.
[1:09:20.860 --> 1:09:27.140]  Remember, these are people in Washington that rejected the idea of natural immunity.
[1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:32.420]  For a year and a half, they said that the vaccine was better than prior infection. And
[1:09:32.420 --> 1:09:37.100]  every credible study that's been done has said that that's not the case. And so they've
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:41.780]  been wrong time and time again. They were wrong when they criticized me for having schools
[1:09:41.780 --> 1:09:46.020]  open. They wanted our kids locked out of school in the state of Florida. They were wrong when
[1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:50.900]  they criticized me for having businesses open, beaches, all these other things. And so this
[1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:59.020]  is an example where they are pushing this with very, very, very scant data. But again,
[1:09:59.020 --> 1:10:03.180]  people can make their judgments, but ask questions. And the fact of the matter is I think what
[1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:09.620]  this whole year and a half has shown us is these regulatory agencies in the federal government
[1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:16.980]  have basically become subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical companies. They are not independent
[1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:23.380]  regulators. They basically are there to rubber stamp what Pfizer wants to do. So people can
[1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:28.500]  make their judgments on it, but we have not ordered any for the Department of Health. There's
[1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:33.820]  been absolutely zero change in our recommendations. And the recommendations, remember, we were
[1:10:33.820 --> 1:10:39.300]  the first state to recommend against six to 11 year olds. We never had any state programs
[1:10:39.300 --> 1:10:44.220]  for any of that. There have been some practitioners that have ordered it and some have gotten it.
[1:10:44.220 --> 1:10:49.100]  These parents are not giving it for the kids with the MNRA, but some did. And I think it's
[1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:53.860]  the same thing. So this is a continuation of our policy that we've had in place really
[1:10:53.860 --> 1:10:54.860]  since the spring.
[1:10:54.860 --> 1:10:59.780]  Well, I really liked DeSantis before, but I love him. That's exactly what Trump should
[1:10:59.780 --> 1:11:06.380]  be saying. Hey, these regulatory agencies lied to us. This is a fraud. We should stop
[1:11:06.380 --> 1:11:14.020]  this. Here's the evidence. That's leadership. He needs to be the next president. 100 percent
[1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:19.660]  behind what DeSantis is doing. That was powerful. That was truth. That is an example of how
[1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:23.980]  we defeat the globalists with the truth and the science and the facts. I am just blown
[1:11:23.980 --> 1:11:30.860]  away by DeSantis at this point. He is the man we should be behind. There's no way he'd
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:36.860]  be saying all that if he was a Trojan horse. There's no way he'd be doing that. This guy
[1:11:36.860 --> 1:11:41.260]  is for real. You judge a tree by its fruits. It is simply amazing. All right, let's start
[1:11:41.260 --> 1:11:45.820]  going to your phone calls here. I just had to play at DeSantis Club. This is so amazing.
[1:11:45.820 --> 1:11:50.140]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina to talk about how to defeat the globalists. Tell us
[1:11:50.140 --> 1:11:56.220]  how to do that. Alex, can you hear me? I can. Go ahead. Man, this is amazing. I'm a first
[1:11:56.220 --> 1:12:04.100]  time caller and I mean, first time ever to...anyway, I almost made it on the Pete Santilli show,
[1:12:04.100 --> 1:12:11.220]  but something went wrong. And I'm glad to just be talking to you right now. And I appreciate
[1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:17.220]  it. I appreciate you. Go ahead, sir. Thank you. Well, you have for a year and a half
[1:12:17.220 --> 1:12:26.780]  of my life really been helping me put pieces together. I think I found you on a documentary
[1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:35.660]  in the talking about Washington, DC, and just showed short clips from the Bohemian Grove.
[1:12:35.660 --> 1:12:42.340]  The fact that all these years you've been nailing it on the head, the biggest problem we have,
[1:12:42.340 --> 1:12:46.580]  the Bible tells us we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities,
[1:12:46.580 --> 1:12:53.780]  powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places. So this is the same scenario over and over
[1:12:53.780 --> 1:13:00.220]  again and you've exposed this satanic element. And because of that, I feel like that would
[1:13:00.220 --> 1:13:08.220]  be their most needful thing. They may not believe they're talking to demons. They may
[1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:15.700]  not believe that what they're doing is evil. But somehow, some way, it has to be exposed
[1:13:15.700 --> 1:13:21.220]  for what it is. So you're saying the answer is it's a spiritual battle. I agree. Realizing
[1:13:21.220 --> 1:13:25.100]  it's a fight between good and evil is the most important thing to do to defeat the
[1:13:25.100 --> 1:13:31.220]  new ruler. How can we do that together? I want to encourage you. I want to exhort you.
[1:13:31.220 --> 1:13:40.780]  You share the name of Jesus Christ. That, to me, puts you in a league that few can handle
[1:13:40.780 --> 1:13:48.780]  because the pressure of being unashamed is constantly coming at you. You talk about Jesus
[1:13:48.780 --> 1:13:53.620]  and God in a spiritual battle, that's when they come after you because that's the solution.
[1:13:53.620 --> 1:13:57.340]  That's why it doesn't mean I'm perfect. It doesn't mean I'm unpredictable how to live.
[1:13:57.340 --> 1:14:01.540]  I just know it's a fight between good and evil. I know Jesus is the answer. He's the
[1:14:01.540 --> 1:14:08.300]  enemy number one to them. You know, we're attached to his hip. He said, because you support
[1:14:08.300 --> 1:14:13.060]  me, you will be persecuted. Right. They hated me. They're going to hate you. It's not something
[1:14:13.060 --> 1:14:19.460]  that we should resent. Bless them. No, we should be glad. We should believe me. Yes. Bless
[1:14:19.460 --> 1:14:25.300]  our you, Alex, when men revile you and persecute you and speak all manners of evil against
[1:14:25.300 --> 1:14:30.940]  you falsely for his namesake, for yours is the kingdom. And because of this element that
[1:14:30.940 --> 1:14:37.220]  you have become in the United States of America, people are like dissenters. You just said
[1:14:37.220 --> 1:14:42.020]  dissenters, but I'm guaranteeing you he's listening to your broadcast. I'm guaranteeing
[1:14:42.020 --> 1:14:47.340]  it because he understands where you come from. You come from the place where no one
[1:14:47.340 --> 1:14:52.580]  wants to admit they've been and you've not been ashamed. You've not ever as far as I've
[1:14:52.580 --> 1:14:57.140]  been listening to you. You've been telling on yourself. You're not, you're not hiding
[1:14:57.140 --> 1:15:02.100]  the fact that you're, you're a flawed human being, you know, so you're, you're really
[1:15:02.100 --> 1:15:07.420]  defeating them because you take from them the only weapon that they have to use against
[1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:12.460]  you. And that's your flaws. So you're kind of like, well, beautifully said, brother,
[1:15:12.460 --> 1:15:18.180]  and I hear you and you're right. I said, what is the answer? I wanted to hear from you guys
[1:15:18.180 --> 1:15:22.180]  and you, the first caller, you were the first caller in on the board. I went in the order
[1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:26.140]  they received you said it is a spiritual battle. Beautifully said, Jay, I appreciate you from
[1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:30.540]  North Carolina. Are we going to go to break and I get everybody in this hour that's holding
[1:15:30.540 --> 1:15:34.980]  right now. We're going to come back and go to Joe and John and so many others on the
[1:15:34.980 --> 1:15:40.780]  other side. Remember, it's an information war. The enemy is working around the clock
[1:15:40.780 --> 1:15:46.340]  to block what this information getting out. What do they hate the most? This broadcast
[1:15:46.340 --> 1:15:53.420]  share the live feeds info wars.com forward slash show, band.video, the info war.tv,
[1:15:53.420 --> 1:15:58.260]  the info war.tv will be right back.
[1:15:58.260 --> 1:16:04.140]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right. People ask
[1:16:04.140 --> 1:16:08.460]  what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew
[1:16:08.460 --> 1:16:14.420]  this was coming. I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become
[1:16:14.420 --> 1:16:20.580]  more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and
[1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:27.180]  documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth.
[1:16:27.180 --> 1:16:32.660]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're
[1:16:32.660 --> 1:16:36.780]  making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing.
[1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:40.500]  God's watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners
[1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:44.540]  for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you
[1:16:44.540 --> 1:16:48.500]  info wars would not be here. So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are
[1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:53.260]  the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank
[1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:57.940]  you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:16:57.940 --> 1:17:03.060]  That's just Susan's new film 2000 meals is the most important documentary in modern times
[1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:07.540]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:12.300]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[1:17:12.300 --> 1:17:15.860]  Now it's great that it's online. It's great that millions watched online but you need
[1:17:15.860 --> 1:17:21.580]  to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras show it can't be
[1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:27.260]  censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know. Go to infowarstore.com

[1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:49.060]  of covid land get them separate get them together massively discounted at infowarstore.com but
[1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:55.820]  everyone needs to have 2000 meals in their library so the globalist can't censor it infowarstore.com

[1:20:01.860 --> 1:20:25.860]  new world order it's alex jones.
[1:20:31.860 --> 1:20:44.860]  Welcome back alex jones here on the live show take your calls how to defeat the new world
[1:20:44.860 --> 1:20:49.100]  order what's the most evil thing they're up to and how do we stop them john and tennessee
[1:20:49.100 --> 1:20:56.420]  you're on the air welcome hello can you hear me alex yes sir go ahead first time caller
[1:20:56.420 --> 1:21:00.540]  just been listening to you for about a year and man you've been very impactful on on
[1:21:00.540 --> 1:21:04.100]  my life and I know so many others and just want to say we're glad to have you back in
[1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:08.660]  the studio and we really missed you last week hope you got some good rest.
[1:21:08.660 --> 1:21:12.900]  I guess to start off how do we stop the globalist I believe it's imperative kind of dovetailing
[1:21:12.900 --> 1:21:16.860]  off the last caller we've got to lose our fear of man we've got to be able to speak
[1:21:16.860 --> 1:21:22.100]  out in the public square and alerting everyone to the crimes against humanity that you have
[1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:27.500]  awakened so many of us to and also the what's their plan to be in the future they're coming
[1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:31.980]  global attack we've got to we've got to speak out and one easy way that I did that I bought
[1:21:31.980 --> 1:21:36.740]  the alex jones's right t-shirt I went to the trump rally in Memphis this past weekend and
[1:21:36.740 --> 1:21:41.340]  let me tell you I felt like a rock star walking around with that t-shirt on I was getting high
[1:21:41.340 --> 1:21:45.980]  five this this bumps you know I got to get me one of those shirts we went to our seats
[1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:53.100]  my wife and I we had great seats right to stage left real quickly don jr. comes out he sees
[1:21:53.100 --> 1:21:57.860]  the shirt it's like a it's like I was highlighted he's just locked in on me during I mean half
[1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:02.620]  of his talk he was talking right to me he he mentioned the globalist I know it was a you
[1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:08.820]  know a direct result of that shirt you know trump comes out same things he's a shirt it's
[1:22:08.820 --> 1:22:14.140]  just a small way that I believe we can speak out for this whole message because everyone
[1:22:14.140 --> 1:22:18.620]  understands the alex jones messages the message of the globalist and the elite and what they're
[1:22:18.620 --> 1:22:25.500]  doing and it was almost like the tale of you know two stories because after after the
[1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:30.980]  the rally was over with my wife and I we go to a kind of a bougie area of Memphis and
[1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:36.300]  go eat go going to go have a Thai meal so we get out of our car walking across the park
[1:22:36.300 --> 1:22:41.980]  and I can enjoy a good dinner at a Thai restaurant and this elderly gentleman walks out with his
[1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:48.460]  wife getting into his nice little sports car and he looks up at me he sees the shirt and
[1:22:48.460 --> 1:22:53.340]  he yells out across the parking lot it's like a the devil came out of the man he says alex
[1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:58.860]  jones was not right and I just lifted the shirt off my chest and I said sir alex jones
[1:22:58.860 --> 1:23:04.940]  was right he sits down in his car sticks his finger out flips me off yells some obscenities
[1:23:04.940 --> 1:23:11.860]  out the window instead of reciprocating and kind I calmly walked to the window I asked
[1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:16.500]  him to roll the window down I said I said sir I just want you to realize my wife and
[1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:21.460]  I were just trying to walk across park line to have a nice meal and you are behaving you
[1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:26.820]  know completely erratic out of control like what's going on with you he starts to apologize
[1:23:26.820 --> 1:23:30.100]  I didn't have anything to do with him I walk away and my wife walks up and begins this
[1:23:30.100 --> 1:23:35.340]  conversation with him about the globalist and Bill Gates and Clow Schwab and all these
[1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:40.980]  things you know so we go in we sit down the waitress that waits on us she's like oh my
[1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:46.140]  god alex jones I love that she was like she starts we had this long conversation over
[1:23:46.140 --> 1:23:50.620]  the meal about alex jones and everything that's going on with the globalist she says my car
[1:23:50.620 --> 1:23:53.780]  is covered in bumper stickers we go outside after dinner drive around the back of the
[1:23:53.780 --> 1:23:59.900]  car a back of the restaurant sure enough you know trumps alex jones stickers all over
[1:23:59.900 --> 1:24:03.980]  one of the people in the restaurant come out of the back and and my wife yells out alex
[1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:09.260]  jones was right and the guy calmly is like heck yeah he was I mean we just had the best
[1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:15.580]  night but wearing that shirt is just one small way to get in the public square and proclaim
[1:24:15.580 --> 1:24:20.220]  the message we have got to alert everyone around us what is going on let me say this
[1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:24.580]  I'm so glad you called because when I tell the story how I get mobbed when I was on
[1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:29.500]  a business vacation trip mobbed at airports mobbed at grocery stores mobbed at hotels
[1:24:29.500 --> 1:24:35.660]  mobbed at restaurants mobbed black white old young didn't matter liberties popular but
[1:24:35.660 --> 1:24:40.540]  the average person doesn't know how many people are awake but wearing one of these alex jones
[1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:43.860]  was right shirts by the way were sold out they're now back in stock the regular one
[1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:48.580]  and designer one really lets you break through and see how many people are actually awake
[1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:53.220]  it's an amazing adventure but I want to thank you sir for calling and just God bless you
[1:24:53.220 --> 1:25:00.580]  and I appreciate your call and yes we are battling to stay on air and and and I'm so
[1:25:00.580 --> 1:25:06.060]  thankful to people that buy products and for short I come but I've been so busy that for
[1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:12.980]  three weeks we had the regular it's actually a very nice expensive shirt for us to make
[1:25:12.980 --> 1:25:17.380]  alex jones was right shirt but I wanted a designer shirt well the designer shirt is
[1:25:17.380 --> 1:25:26.100]  now in at infowarstore.com and again it causes a big uproar when you wear it believe me
[1:25:26.100 --> 1:25:30.620]  I don't lie to you sometimes I'm a little wrong about things but I never purposely
[1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:35.180]  to steer you wrong you want to see what it's like to be alex jones wear one of these shirts
[1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:41.260]  now listen you might get hit in the head with a ball peen hammer or stab too now you'll
[1:25:41.260 --> 1:25:45.980]  shake 200 hands before somebody takes a swing at you but I want to tell you wear one of
[1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:50.820]  these shirts watch your ass because you're going to be alex jones at that point wear
[1:25:50.820 --> 1:25:55.180]  the shirt you'll experience the adventure for yourself and you'll go my god I didn't
[1:25:55.180 --> 1:25:59.300]  know this many people are awake did you hear him he goes to trump rally he's mobbed he
[1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:04.580]  goes to a restaurant has three four contacts that are positive one contact that was in
[1:26:04.580 --> 1:26:10.620]  his face that is exactly what it's like I want you to experience it and then it puts
[1:26:10.620 --> 1:26:16.420]  money into operation stay on air to keep putting the message out but yes they are enraged
[1:26:16.420 --> 1:26:22.460]  and how successful and informative info wars is and all the glory goes to God and the listeners
[1:26:22.460 --> 1:26:29.180]  and the crew I'm just a focal point of this and I get all the attacks to look out what
[1:26:29.180 --> 1:26:35.180]  she asked for but listen it's all in God's hands at this point this is a limited edition
[1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:39.220]  by the way this last run these shirts will not be made again there'll be a new alex
[1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:43.380]  jones's right shirt but people kept asking for it you got it it's extremely popular
[1:26:43.380 --> 1:26:50.320]  if you want to get it there's the designer shirt costs us like $18 a shirt the other
[1:26:50.320 --> 1:26:56.860]  shirt really is his honor as well it costs us $11 $12 a shirt but they're both available
[1:26:56.860 --> 1:27:01.700]  they were great for men and women info wars for a comic I'm done plugging I'm done plugging
[1:27:01.700 --> 1:27:05.220]  because if I go to break or I go to calls now I'm gonna cut you off short I'm gonna
[1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:10.820]  come back do this the gommies great you'll understand let's push the gommie back to 15
[1:27:10.820 --> 1:27:15.820]  after next hour only 45 minutes was a smart guy when talking about the waterfront boys
[1:27:15.820 --> 1:27:20.940]  he got a prediction everything that way we'll have plenty of time to get to all these callers
[1:27:20.940 --> 1:27:28.660]  up next who's the longest holding that'll be John Joe digital Dave everybody but these
[1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:33.060]  callers are all great but no matter how good your call is I gotta cut you off at two minutes
[1:27:33.060 --> 1:27:38.700]  we'll never get to everybody so that's coming up next segment you know I wish we could find
[1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:46.300]  this operation with Alex Jones's right shirts I think we've sold like 15,000 of them but
[1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:50.660]  that's over three months and so if you're making $10 on a shirt that's not gonna pay
[1:27:50.660 --> 1:27:54.980]  for the uplinks and the bandwidth and I'm not complaining and we're looking at trying
[1:27:54.980 --> 1:28:00.220]  to cut the quality of videos at Band-Aid video and stuff because it's just moderate quality
[1:28:00.220 --> 1:28:04.820]  but man two hundred three hundred thousand dollar bills a month I mean we got five six
[1:28:04.820 --> 1:28:10.060]  seven million people a day watching videos at Band-Aid video which I love it's what I
[1:28:10.060 --> 1:28:15.580]  want but we don't have YouTube we don't have Twitter we don't have Instagram we are paying
[1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:21.740]  for it all and I've already spent 90% of the money from my house sale and I've already
[1:28:21.740 --> 1:28:26.140]  spent almost all the money I've got and I don't even care about that except I care about
[1:28:26.140 --> 1:28:31.300]  the tank running low and thinking what will it be like when I finally got to start shutting
[1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:35.180]  stuff down I don't want to do that I can't imagine that's gonna happen so I'm asking

[1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:33.860]  I know there are people that believe that as well the significant number of people believe
[1:33:33.860 --> 1:33:39.500]  that then shouldn't they have been made readily available in poorer countries or does it only
[1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:44.420]  matter that richer countries have access to that medicine there's a problem there particularly
[1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:50.380]  when these ideas are couched in neoliberalist politics there are all that fairness and sharing
[1:33:50.380 --> 1:33:54.700]  and kindness and whenever there's any cynicism and doubt you're a conspiracy theorist you're
[1:33:54.700 --> 1:33:58.580]  a nutter you're against progress follow the science we've just heard the problem with
[1:33:58.580 --> 1:34:03.860]  following the science is that the science follows the money that's the issue science
[1:34:03.860 --> 1:34:09.660]  is a subset of commerce truly objective science as is being suggested here independent networks
[1:34:09.660 --> 1:34:13.820]  focused on scientific endeavour of course we want that you'd have to be an idiot to
[1:34:13.820 --> 1:34:19.740]  sort of deny the effectiveness of bloody geniuses in laboratories looking at cells and examining
[1:34:19.740 --> 1:34:23.860]  the behaviour of viruses and medicines although I would suggest there are some evidence that
[1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:28.660]  implies that that should be conducted with extreme caution especially if you're near
[1:34:28.660 --> 1:34:32.700]  a wet market all sorts of stuff comes out of those things but science within extreme
[1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:37.460]  commercial and financial imperatives we just accept as normal because none of us appreciate
[1:34:37.460 --> 1:34:41.540]  the water that we swim in this is our reality which is always just normal yeah big business
[1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:45.460]  shareholders we don't do the research if it's not cost effective we've grown up on that
[1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:50.460]  but it's a problem when you present it as medically effective socially responsible personally
[1:34:50.460 --> 1:34:54.380]  necessary there are many many questions that are left unanswered and not questions that
[1:34:54.380 --> 1:34:59.780]  are going to be asked by Klaus Schwab at the Bloody Davos WF Puff Peace Factory that's
[1:34:59.780 --> 1:35:04.180]  primary intention it seems to me is to create a globalist technocracy limit your individual
[1:35:04.180 --> 1:35:26.260]  power your community collective and even national power you know if you just joined us the last
[1:35:26.260 --> 1:35:30.700]  caller brought up how he wore an Alexandros right shirt and the adventure of the evening
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:36.140]  how insane it was and when I tell you that put one of these shirts on as an adventure
[1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:41.940]  by just saying that it will let you know how awake humanity is in your area you can wear
[1:35:41.940 --> 1:35:47.060]  one in Portland and you'll get more support than you get negative you can wear one in
[1:35:47.060 --> 1:35:52.020]  red areas to people be carrying around their shoulders and it just shows how awake people
[1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:58.140]  are and how weak the globalists are and how we can win together if we just stand up and
[1:35:58.140 --> 1:36:02.500]  don't have fear of man as an earlier caller said and tell the truth and let the chips
[1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:08.180]  fall where they may okay let's go the calls of the order they are received let's talk
[1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:18.220]  to Joe in Nebraska Joe thanks for calling oh yes sir go ahead all right good afternoon
[1:36:18.220 --> 1:36:22.100]  and if you're doing God's work so thank you I'll keep this short I'll make my point and
[1:36:22.100 --> 1:36:27.900]  let you answer I've got three things in my mind it's hard to answer your question because
[1:36:27.900 --> 1:36:33.660]  they're all important but justice we need to get rid of the DA's the FBI that's not
[1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:37.740]  doing his job I think that these people had a fear of prosecution they wouldn't keep doing
[1:36:37.740 --> 1:36:42.540]  the things like you know spraying chemicals on us and releasing things and thing number
[1:36:42.540 --> 1:36:46.660]  two might be the media we need to do like we did with the big oil and the phone companies
[1:36:46.660 --> 1:36:51.860]  years ago we need to break up the big media we need to bring back the truth and advertising
[1:36:51.860 --> 1:36:57.220]  rules and number three I think we needed to deal with the education I think we need to
[1:36:57.220 --> 1:37:03.140]  you know get God back in schools common sense teach the truth not just propaganda whether
[1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:09.300]  one or one or all of these three are on the top of the list I don't know but in my mind
[1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:16.220]  I think we don't get the rules and laws we have enforced and they're going to get worse
[1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:21.820]  and keep doing what they're doing that's why I love taking calls because I laid out open
[1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:29.060]  borders collapsing currency pedophilia poison shots devaluation of currency starting wars
[1:37:29.060 --> 1:37:35.020]  but the end of the day we have a Praetorian guard that protects the corrupt deep state
[1:37:35.020 --> 1:37:40.180]  that is the Justice Department that persecutes the innocent and defends and protects the
[1:37:40.180 --> 1:37:45.460]  corrupt and so that really is the big issue that we have a captured government with a
[1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:50.140]  deep state and that's why they're able to do everything else they do because they've
[1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:55.740]  captured the American Empire so what you said out of all the issues is really the answer
[1:37:55.740 --> 1:38:00.140]  I didn't think of that and you're absolutely right and the other two points you made restate
[1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:05.700]  those again education the brainwashing our children and then what was the other one
[1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:13.340]  the education might take you know seven years like what the Stalin said but the media if
[1:38:13.340 --> 1:38:18.940]  we don't break break up the monopolies of what for they're right all the trust busting
[1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:23.300]  we need to end monopolies take control of education and we need to take control the
[1:38:23.300 --> 1:38:27.700]  federal government and the and the deep state apparatchics beautifully said God bless you
[1:38:27.700 --> 1:38:35.940]  Joe our full call and again I think I'm pretty smart and I say here's what I think the big
[1:38:35.940 --> 1:38:40.580]  issues are what do you think and he calls in I totally agree with him because all those
[1:38:40.580 --> 1:38:48.380]  other things are a symptom of a captured government bingo bingo bingo bingo digital Dave in Wisconsin
[1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:55.260]  digital Dave go ahead thank you Alex God bless you and yours my brother my beloved wife and

[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:05.780]  anointed staff and all of the info warriors out there I'll get right to my point but let's
[1:39:05.780 --> 1:39:11.420]  say a quick prayer here Father God we are grateful and thankful and your hope you tell
[1:39:11.420 --> 1:39:17.340]  us to be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving
[1:39:17.340 --> 1:39:23.220]  let our request be known to you God and then the peace of God with passes all understanding
[1:39:23.220 --> 1:39:27.860]  shall keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus because you have not given us a spirit
[1:39:27.860 --> 1:39:33.820]  of fear Lord but of power and of love and of a sound mind Alex thank you for allowing
[1:39:33.820 --> 1:39:38.660]  us to be part of the info wars broadcast and they in a sympathical relationship by making
[1:39:38.660 --> 1:39:43.980]  product resources available to us I mean that's really great I mean we got the coins videos
[1:39:43.980 --> 1:39:48.460]  product that even the mask you know and everything is super high quality thing and let me tell
[1:39:48.460 --> 1:39:54.260]  you sorrows the Democrats have thrown hundreds of millions against you and I and you have
[1:39:54.260 --> 1:40:02.540]  stood with us like a storm wall around a city I mean all I can say is thank you for staying
[1:40:02.540 --> 1:40:06.780]  in the fight because it's been and now the fight is so important because we know we were
[1:40:06.780 --> 1:40:11.820]  right and we know the world's waking up and now we're reaching that critical twelfth round
[1:40:11.820 --> 1:40:16.700]  absolutely we we have a much longer history than what you know back to your beginnings
[1:40:16.700 --> 1:40:21.820]  and and what that left it to us I mean they removed all of our websites and everything
[1:40:21.820 --> 1:40:26.020]  from all all stuff we've got over a hundred and five and I'd like to I'd like to put your
[1:40:26.020 --> 1:40:34.220]  ad on our site so I have to talk to you about that later here why my priority one to defeat
[1:40:34.220 --> 1:40:40.540]  the demonic new world order Luciferian death spots is the vaccine because everything is
[1:40:40.540 --> 1:40:48.820]  tied to the vaccine reasons there are a lot of reasons you know to use the vaccine because
[1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:54.020]  there's so much and like I said everything is tied to it the kids and school the media
[1:40:54.020 --> 1:41:03.260]  everything reason of using the vaccine is because there is so much going on in media
[1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:14.100]  from reputable source creators reputable medical sources and it should be easier to call out
[1:41:14.100 --> 1:41:22.140]  these people if we can if we can prove it now people have a natural propensity to be
[1:41:22.140 --> 1:41:31.620]  in the dark so proving the masses proving to the masses that the Vax is deadly and calling
[1:41:31.620 --> 1:41:37.860]  out those supporters and who what when we're why and how situation it should always be
[1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:43.540]  on the tip of our tongue we should have the names of the people involved I mean I know
[1:41:43.540 --> 1:41:50.060]  personally that these inbred freaks are weak but they have money in NATO and we all know
[1:41:50.060 --> 1:41:58.380]  that and and if we post important information we can tie every one of the people from Klaus
[1:41:58.380 --> 1:42:08.540]  Schwab to Bill Gates to you know governors and senators right to this and and get our
[1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:15.420]  nation back but it's going to require work and a plan and the people have to individually
[1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:21.980]  create that plan and don't do it without prayer first start with prayer listen they're killing
[1:42:21.980 --> 1:42:30.100]  170 people to save one person Steve Kerr said in one of Greece's great videos so what we
[1:42:30.100 --> 1:42:34.780]  what we can do I think is get a list of names of all the Davos attendees might not be that
[1:42:34.780 --> 1:42:40.100]  easy but I think we could do it and share it with everyone well that's happening they're
[1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:44.060]  panicking all over the corporate media that people are looking at Davos the Davos alumni
[1:42:44.060 --> 1:42:50.580]  powerful points digital digital Dave we've got Derek up next on the other side and then

[1:48:22.940 --> 1:48:30.340]  a performance artist I'm perceived as a clown to nut the maniac on his website info wars
[1:48:30.340 --> 1:48:37.220]  he tells her and noia born the sickest most offensive theories alex jones claims that
[1:48:37.220 --> 1:48:43.660]  9 11 and the oklahoma city bombings were inside jobs don't you stand for america sir he said
[1:48:43.660 --> 1:48:53.740]  me and hillary are demons I met him back in 1990 I knew right away he was going to be
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:49:03.340]  a star I saw all these conspiracy theorists that we're talking about the new world order
[1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:07.260]  was that attack on humanity I saw early on that I really wanted to wait for on you're
[1:49:07.260 --> 1:49:14.260]  lying to the public it's disgusting when she tastes that there's no going back to everything's
[1:49:14.260 --> 1:49:19.060]  a war that's the way the universe works and everything is propaganda I don't trust Donald

[1:49:24.940 --> 1:49:31.700]  I will not let you down that's when the media took the gloves off alex jones said the sandy
[1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:36.380]  hook shooting which claimed the lives of 20 children was fake I try to tell the truth
[1:49:36.380 --> 1:49:40.740]  and sometimes I'm wrong do the new york times get in trouble for consciously lying about
[1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:50.540]  wmds that then led to a war kill tens of thousands of consulate no the attempts to platformers

[1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:50.180]  and just wanted to say one of the things most important stuff that we can do is continue

[1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:03.500]  just try to keep breaking through to your friends and family it may take a lot of effort
[1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:07.700]  may not feel like it's gotten anywhere but we have to break through over the past six
[1:51:07.700 --> 1:51:11.860]  months I've gotten through to some people that would have never ever listened to this
[1:51:11.860 --> 1:51:20.500]  stuff and it does cause the train chain reaction as you always say and just a reminder that
[1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:26.420]  I think I heard it here but at no other point in human history have we ever had as many
[1:51:26.420 --> 1:51:32.540]  people awake to the scam as we do right now there are more people on earth right now aware
[1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:38.780]  of what's going on and all it takes is more spreading the word and sharing the information
[1:51:38.780 --> 1:51:44.860]  and the biggest thing that I think we need to do is get to people in positions of power
[1:51:44.860 --> 1:51:50.060]  and authority police officers people that can the people that are actually following the
[1:51:50.060 --> 1:51:55.540]  orders because never the order givers that are doing the damage it's the order followers
[1:51:55.540 --> 1:52:02.620]  who are actually injecting the vaccines walking people up stopping people from from you know
[1:52:02.620 --> 1:52:07.780]  using their first amendment rights and freedom of speech it's the police officers the ones
[1:52:07.780 --> 1:52:13.780]  that follow the orders not just police officers but you know people in positions of authority
[1:52:13.780 --> 1:52:19.460]  that just say I'm just doing my job and I'm just doing that without them these people
[1:52:19.460 --> 1:52:23.980]  don't have anybody to carry out their evil dictates and their evil stuff it's getting
[1:52:23.980 --> 1:52:29.780]  to the people that actually are the ones that are doing the subjugation the people following
[1:52:29.780 --> 1:52:34.220]  the orders the minion those are the most important people to try to break through to and just
[1:52:34.220 --> 1:52:40.740]  keep going just keep pushing and and you know spread the good word I totally agree with
[1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:45.980]  you Mike and I mean look they got us all compartmentalized they've got us all vulcanized atomizes
[1:52:45.980 --> 1:52:50.620]  the term and it's just going to get worse I mean I've got stacks of news how to destroy
[1:52:50.620 --> 1:52:54.220]  on the economy how they're coming after beef we knew they would do it but now they've announced
[1:52:54.220 --> 1:52:59.140]  how they're gonna do it carbon taxes on the beef we knew it was coming it's all here and
[1:52:59.140 --> 1:53:05.660]  it's just gonna get worse and worse and worse until we wake up to it it's that simple yep
[1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:11.300]  and I mean look at you know who who's flying the plane dropping chemtrails on top of us
[1:53:11.300 --> 1:53:15.620]  I mean it's the people that are actually doing the work it's the pilot it's the you know
[1:53:15.620 --> 1:53:20.900]  police officer the soldier the doctor and that's why they're trying to move to robots and drones
[1:53:20.900 --> 1:53:25.460]  so now humans will be completely cut out of it and then they can do anything they want
[1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:31.420]  that's why we've got them in check we got to take them to checkmate now have to keep pushing
[1:53:31.420 --> 1:53:36.820]  have to keep pushing and spreading the word thank you Mike anything else Mike no no just
[1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:41.540]  that's it thanks Alex I appreciate it welcome back appreciate you God bless you all right
[1:53:41.540 --> 1:53:46.660]  let's go ahead and talk to Derek in Virginia Derek are on the air hey how you doing Alex
[1:53:46.660 --> 1:53:51.580]  I'm all right hey you know I was wondering I want to cover the issue act you know one
[1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:56.340]  thing I've never heard nobody talk about on the show that Trump's biggest mistake was
[1:53:56.340 --> 1:54:01.540]  not selecting Rudy Giuliani and his attorney general he would have selected Rudy Giuliani
[1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:05.460]  his attorney general I don't believe we would have had Russia I don't believe we would have
[1:54:05.460 --> 1:54:10.380]  had Ukraine I don't believe we would have had so many cabinet members inside who turned
[1:54:10.380 --> 1:54:15.300]  on the president and that's just top that was his biggest mistake I believe and no one
[1:54:15.300 --> 1:54:20.540]  wants to say that or admit that but personally my opinions that was his greatest mistake
[1:54:20.540 --> 1:54:25.940]  that he made to this day and I agree Giuliani would have had a lot better attorney general
[1:54:25.940 --> 1:54:31.180]  than the other two he had you know man when he was campaigning man you know we thought
[1:54:31.180 --> 1:54:34.900]  that he was going to pick Giuliani and when he announced sessions man I couldn't believe
[1:54:34.900 --> 1:54:40.100]  it or neither could my wife and we suffered gravely from that because whether just session
[1:54:40.100 --> 1:54:46.060]  was an insider or not somebody got him to give up his post and refuse himself and everything
[1:54:46.060 --> 1:54:51.220]  went down here from there but I wanted to ask you also to Alex and I don't know if this
[1:54:51.220 --> 1:54:57.500]  is personal for you or not but why don't you and Steve Bannon get together man they are
[1:54:57.500 --> 1:55:03.060]  after you they are after Ben listen Steve Bannon said a lot of nice things about me I'm not
[1:55:03.060 --> 1:55:06.700]  the middle of him and Rogers fight I stay out of that I think Bannon is a lot of great
[1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:10.900]  work I think Rogers a lot of great work I'm guessing that's why it is but Bannon's people
[1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:14.100]  like oh he wants you on he wants you on he never does it I've invited Bannon on here
[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:17.420]  you name it so that's a question for Steve Bannon the door is open for Steve Bannon
[1:55:17.420 --> 1:55:18.420]  on the show.
[1:55:18.420 --> 1:55:21.500]  Well you know I would like to ask him that too if I could but you know I just asked
[1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:26.220]  it because man you too man you are number one Alex and you are man not that simple to
[1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:32.020]  spear you are the spear man nobody is leading a charge man putting their life on the line
[1:55:32.020 --> 1:55:37.060]  like you are man you and Owen and the rest of your cast your production the fact that
[1:55:37.060 --> 1:55:41.540]  you produce your own commercials man it's amazing what you're doing man and I know
[1:55:41.540 --> 1:55:46.460]  that God is pushing you man because the evilest thing they're doing to us my mind is the
[1:55:46.460 --> 1:55:52.460]  proper gander that's why we need info wars that's why we got to have Alex Jones Owen
[1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:58.700]  Schroyer all the guests they come on and contribute the proper gander is killing us I talked to
[1:55:58.700 --> 1:56:05.340]  my dad the other day he over in the Dominican Republic right now and nothing I tell him
[1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:10.540]  will get through as a matter of fact he told me it's nothing I could show him that would
[1:56:10.540 --> 1:56:16.940]  change his mind I try to show him info wars articles I try to show him the 2000 mules
[1:56:16.940 --> 1:56:23.620]  he has solely bought the proper gander 100 million percent and all we could do is keep
[1:56:23.620 --> 1:56:30.860]  using the info war man battle tank to keep breaking the armor I mean as everything implodes
[1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:34.820]  under Biden what is the point your dad's gonna wake up so I'm sure he's a good person he
[1:56:34.820 --> 1:56:41.100]  just can't believe it's this bad he's projecting his own goodness I think onto the system I
[1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:45.380]  think he's right man because he take every shot he take every booster and I can't even
[1:56:45.380 --> 1:56:49.460]  believe he ain't fell out yet well you know I learned the stuff all it was him and learned
[1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:55.660]  to take his point is just that man if we need a worldwide prayer just like when these entertainers
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:56:59.900]  that the whole world so-called stop spinning and everybody want to hold candles and prayer
[1:56:59.900 --> 1:57:07.940]  and London Paris friends do we got to have a worldwide call to God and a focal point

[1:59:49.820 --> 2:00:17.100]  getting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:00:17.100 --> 2:00:30.220]  America is already suffering a food shortage which can be felt by rising costs and emptying
[2:00:30.220 --> 2:00:36.180]  shelves at the grocery store but this is a cakewalk it's going to get much worse the
[2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:43.460]  writing as they say is on the wall any reasonable person can see that this is all being done
[2:00:43.460 --> 2:00:51.260]  deliberately over 10 000 cattle just died and we are told that it was due to 100 degree
[2:00:51.260 --> 2:00:59.100]  weather and in just the past 17 months nearly 100 disasters have mysteriously befallen the
[2:00:59.100 --> 2:01:05.940]  american food industry dozens of catastrophic fires burning down food processing plants
[2:01:05.940 --> 2:01:12.580]  in multiple cases caused by small aircraft crashing into them thousands of tons of meat
[2:01:12.580 --> 2:01:19.340]  destroyed over 2 million turkeys have been destroyed over 40 million chickens have been
[2:01:19.340 --> 2:01:26.820]  destroyed and with the rising cost of fuel farmers are unable to harvest their crops
[2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:35.220]  and it's only just beginning remember joe biden promised he would shut down oil and gas
[2:01:35.220 --> 2:01:43.340]  i have one final would you close down the oil industry would you close down the oil
[2:01:43.340 --> 2:01:48.660]  industry yes it is a big statement because i would stop why would you do that because
[2:01:48.660 --> 2:01:54.180]  the oil industry pollutes significantly i say here's the deal but that's a big statement
[2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:59.500]  well if you let me finish the statement because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over
[2:01:59.500 --> 2:02:05.780]  time over time that's the biggest statement because basically what he's saying is he is
[2:02:05.780 --> 2:02:10.180]  going to destroy the oil industry will you remember that texas will you remember that
[2:02:10.180 --> 2:02:13.860]  pennsylvania oklahoma vice president biden let me give you 10 seconds to respond and
[2:02:13.860 --> 2:02:18.500]  i have to get to the final question vice president biden takes everything out of context but
[2:02:18.500 --> 2:02:26.980]  the point is look we have to move toward a net zero emissions but kiddo i want you to
[2:02:26.980 --> 2:02:34.140]  just take a look ok you don't have to agree but i want you to look at my eyes i guarantee
[2:02:34.140 --> 2:02:40.820]  i guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel and i am not going to clock it and they are
[2:02:40.820 --> 2:02:47.700]  making good with their radical promise except there is no alternative energy plan the biden
[2:02:47.700 --> 2:02:53.780]  administration is doing everything they can to shut down all fossil fuel in this country
[2:02:53.780 --> 2:03:00.100]  and not only will that stop people from driving all public transportation all shipping and
[2:03:00.100 --> 2:03:06.380]  all industry will come to a halt millions will lose their jobs and hundreds of millions
[2:03:06.380 --> 2:03:12.700]  will starve to death whether you like it or not civilization is dependent upon oil and
[2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:20.700]  gas and our government is turning it all off we are also still suffering a baby formula
[2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:26.860]  shortage and what little we do have is being sent to the open southern border for the tens
[2:03:26.860 --> 2:03:33.500]  of thousands of hungry foreigners being brought in unchecked and flown to already struggling
[2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:41.420]  cities across america and after several countries suspended the moderna vaccine for adults due
[2:03:41.420 --> 2:03:48.700]  to safety concerns the united states fda just unanimously voted to inject your infant children
[2:03:48.700 --> 2:03:56.060]  with the deadly shot your government is trying to kill you and if anyone thinks this is hyperbole
[2:03:56.060 --> 2:04:02.580]  or fear mongering they are not paying attention or they are in shock the only solution we
[2:04:02.580 --> 2:04:08.460]  are being offered is to vote even though we have a rigged election system and two parties
[2:04:08.460 --> 2:04:15.340]  that work for the same corporate establishment starvation is coming fast and people can only
[2:04:15.340 --> 2:04:23.220]  survive a few weeks without food and so what exactly will we do if the so-called red wave
[2:04:23.220 --> 2:04:49.220]  this november fails to turn the tide reporting for info wars this is greg rees
[2:04:53.220 --> 2:05:03.780]  there's an old bed one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this trust in

[2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:35.980]  to you we are still on air let's go to noa in chicago noa you're on the air hi can you
[2:06:35.980 --> 2:06:44.420]  hear me yes sir um so when your question about how do we defeat the globalists i think i
[2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:51.340]  think you have to start with love and not taking an account of where you come from or
[2:06:51.340 --> 2:06:58.020]  what state or democratic or republican i don't think it's an issue of that i think we need
[2:06:58.020 --> 2:07:08.980]  to unite and come together in order to defeat them and i think that they push dividing us
[2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:16.860]  in school systems at work and on our media that they have bought out i think you're totally
[2:07:16.860 --> 2:07:22.660]  right we have to realize the enemy is a globalist we can have our fights and differences later
[2:07:22.660 --> 2:07:27.980]  but they're the main enemy attacking us with inflation with division with with the corporate
[2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:34.220]  media with everything they do you're right and one of the main issues that i'm dealing
[2:07:34.220 --> 2:07:40.100]  with especially with our mayor in chicago is how they preach peace in one hand and then
[2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:44.500]  they promote violence in their own city and then not allow the police to do their job
[2:07:44.500 --> 2:07:56.180]  correctly so my lord lightfoot yep so where do you see it going brother um i don't know
[2:07:56.180 --> 2:08:02.500]  it's hard it's hard to look at all the different issues that are going on and when i'm finding
[2:08:02.500 --> 2:08:10.100]  out now at 22 about how my entire life the majority of things that i had learned was
[2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:17.300]  incorrect and that i was born into this after 9 11 so we already started to give up our
[2:08:17.300 --> 2:08:22.260]  rights and allow them to infringe on those things that's right it's all slave training
[2:08:22.260 --> 2:08:27.340]  the border is completely wide open but the tsa searches everything you've got like you're
[2:08:27.340 --> 2:08:32.180]  a terrorist and now they want a world i d and a force vaccination to take over your
[2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:37.780]  body absolutely right no thank you for the call let's talk to carlos in canada carlos
[2:08:37.780 --> 2:08:47.060]  welcome thank you alex a pleasure talking to you again yes sir alex we are an inversion
[2:08:47.060 --> 2:08:53.460]  when a person like hunter biden and another person like julien assange one walks the
[2:08:53.460 --> 2:09:01.220]  streets and the other one is in prison i think it's important that if we look at the problem
[2:09:01.220 --> 2:09:06.580]  the problem of globalism seems to have been more concentrated in the united states and
[2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:13.860]  europe that other areas latin america there's an awakening to that and in in europe uh...
[2:09:13.860 --> 2:09:20.180]  there isn't there is an awakening in in russia in china etc against this globalist agenda
[2:09:20.180 --> 2:09:25.140]  that is destroying the united states ask yourself for a second why is marik garland
[2:09:26.340 --> 2:09:33.140]  in ukraine ukraine is not a nato nation ukraine is not a member of european union
[2:09:33.140 --> 2:09:39.620]  what's he doing there what a jurisdiction does he have when in reality you've got the january
[2:09:39.620 --> 2:09:47.860]  six people in prison essentially without due process um other than you know all sorts of uh
[2:09:48.660 --> 2:09:55.540]  political manipulation i think the issue is one that we're in an inversion and we have to think
[2:09:55.540 --> 2:10:01.140]  out of the box alex to get out of the inversion there was an inversion a long long time ago
[2:10:01.140 --> 2:10:06.740]  when barabas walked and jesus got crucified you have to understand that we're in that same
[2:10:06.740 --> 2:10:12.660]  type of inversion that it requires a a new conceptual way of thinking that we have to
[2:10:12.660 --> 2:10:19.060]  understand that the world economic forum is a glorified chamber of commerce where they have
[2:10:19.060 --> 2:10:26.020]  members who move twenty trillion dollars and they have a lot of power but you know the issue is that
[2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:31.060]  neither the constitution of united states has been changed neither has a constitution of many of
[2:10:31.060 --> 2:10:36.580]  these countries these people are manipulating smoke and mirrors alex and we have to simply
[2:10:36.580 --> 2:10:41.140]  look at them for what they are now other countries are simply saying we don't want any part of you
[2:10:41.140 --> 2:10:46.180]  we don't want to obey we have governor de santa saying the same thing who are these people to
[2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:51.460]  tell us what to do i think that's the attitude that we should take is to examine each individual
[2:10:51.460 --> 2:10:58.340]  and to turn the the weapon that they use against you against them uh you've all know a harari
[2:10:58.340 --> 2:11:04.420]  analyze that i've done a study on this on this thinking and it is absolutely wrong if you use
[2:11:04.420 --> 2:11:10.660]  that kind of analysis you actually show the world economic forum fallacy for what it is smokes and
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:18.740]  mirrors you're right these are complete authoritarian psychopaths creating a system where the criminals
[2:11:18.740 --> 2:11:23.540]  can rule over us and good people are punished thank you carlos all right let's go to a call in new
[2:11:23.540 --> 2:11:30.740]  jersey let's talk to joe in new jersey joe go ahead alex can you hear me yes sir go ahead
[2:11:31.780 --> 2:11:36.100]  thank you for all your sacrifice man i really appreciate it it's well worth it just keep me
[2:11:36.100 --> 2:11:42.420]  in the fire brother hey i had to say it uh there was a new york times article yesterday titled
[2:11:42.420 --> 2:11:49.380]  exciting disastrous pandemic response an expert bipartisan panel calls for the complete overhaul
[2:11:49.380 --> 2:11:55.220]  of the u.s public health system they want a ball of government approach to public health there's a
[2:11:55.220 --> 2:11:59.700]  lot of things going on and a lot of people touch on this but i think the absolute top priority and
[2:11:59.700 --> 2:12:05.940]  core goal of these globalists is the full attack destabilization the seizure seizure of control
[2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:10.900]  over these public health systems around the world they want the full autonomy to create a crisis
[2:12:10.900 --> 2:12:16.420]  and to use it to install whatever protocol they want without any limits or objection this panel
[2:12:16.420 --> 2:12:24.980]  that spoke yesterday is consisted of fda commissioners cdc directors hhs leaders all of which are tied
[2:12:24.980 --> 2:12:30.260]  to the world health organization shortly after you had biden out there asking for money and
[2:12:30.260 --> 2:12:34.740]  talking about the next pandemic i i can't definitively say that's related but the timing
[2:12:34.740 --> 2:12:40.180]  is pretty suspicious um after that world health organization treaty failed despite like 200
[2:12:40.180 --> 2:12:45.380]  countries signing it including the u.s it seems like they're moving into this next option which
[2:12:45.380 --> 2:12:50.260]  is flipping the script and painting the whole covid response is a failure of the public system
[2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:55.300]  that currently exists they want to bring in a new one they create the virus they release it they
[2:12:55.300 --> 2:13:00.500]  block therapeutics they poison the public they call it a failure and even more control for the
[2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:06.020]  next coming pandemic that biden's been talking about yeah that's all the same people they ride
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:10.820]  the momentum in any direction they can straight to the same goal which is to expand the government
[2:13:10.820 --> 2:13:16.260]  health authority with the goal of creating baseline protocol their own regulations and then
[2:13:16.260 --> 2:13:21.300]  you've got a lot a large part of the journal public that's in stockham syndrome believing it's
[2:13:21.300 --> 2:13:27.700]  the system trying to help them right and this plan they flat out state it in this new york times
[2:13:27.700 --> 2:13:35.940]  article um that they want this power to supersede patchwork over all of the 3000 state local tribal
[2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:42.100]  authorities united state no limit they want to yeah that's a that's beyond a federal takeover
[2:13:42.100 --> 2:13:47.460]  it's a global government takeover to end jurisdiction that's it it's a global government
[2:13:47.460 --> 2:13:54.500]  biomedical takeover happening now and the best part is the the people that are brainchilding
[2:13:54.500 --> 2:14:01.940]  this this commonwealth fund it's a hundred year old company you know funds uh merger all of the
[2:14:01.940 --> 2:14:07.060]  same corporate interests these people just move into it it's all from the same globalist money
[2:14:07.060 --> 2:14:14.900]  the founder was a woman who married a Rockefeller investor when she was 16 years old i it's you
[2:14:14.900 --> 2:14:19.540]  can't even make it up these people are all tied together and they want unlimited authority they
[2:14:19.540 --> 2:14:25.540]  want to consolidate all this power into one entity into one person and what is their ideology because
[2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:31.300]  the power they want is one thing but they want the power for forced depopulation the power over

[2:20:01.780 --> 2:20:17.780]  world order it's alex jones
[2:20:32.740 --> 2:20:43.780]  me
[2:20:43.780 --> 2:20:48.500]  fit on my show more than 10 years but I gotta tell you he's written best-selling books he's
[2:20:48.500 --> 2:20:53.060]  covered all he gave us tour of the Vatican and so much more years ago when I was in Rome Italy
[2:20:53.860 --> 2:20:59.540]  and he predicted he said listen they want to get rid of popes staying in their office until they die
[2:20:59.540 --> 2:21:03.540]  they want to start replacing them then they're gonna have a committee after that and all of
[2:21:03.540 --> 2:21:08.420]  its happened he predicted the current pope who's the head of the Jesuits would be the pope
[2:21:08.420 --> 2:21:12.740]  five years before he was he predicted that he would step down now it's all the news he's getting
[2:21:12.740 --> 2:21:17.860]  ready to step down what is that really about because even if you're not a Catholic there's
[2:21:17.860 --> 2:21:23.540]  over a billion people on this planet that are and we've seen this current pope do the opposite of
[2:21:23.540 --> 2:21:30.340]  somebody like john paul second and you know so many others that have been out there and it's just
[2:21:30.340 --> 2:21:38.580]  a crazy time to be alive so what does all this really mean what does this signify and what does
[2:21:38.580 --> 2:21:46.980]  it mean with the current pope a month ago saying nato started the war they should do a deal this
[2:21:46.980 --> 2:21:53.460]  war should stop what does that signify got almost no news coverage there's a lot of pieces to this
[2:21:53.460 --> 2:22:00.820]  looking at the great reset the new world order all these plans leo zegami joins us for the balance
[2:22:00.820 --> 2:22:10.340]  of the hour I appreciate him leo zegami.com leozagami.com or at real leo zegami on gab
[2:22:10.340 --> 2:22:18.340]  and he is here with us to lay this out true vatican former illuminati whistleblower insider
[2:22:18.980 --> 2:22:24.420]  what a time to be alive leo how you knew all this so many years I knew you were 20 years ago
[2:22:24.420 --> 2:22:28.100]  and I was like I don't know that's true or not then all came true that's why I've had you on
[2:22:28.100 --> 2:22:33.860]  what a time to be alive there's so many angles to cover here absolutely Alex it was a pleasure
[2:22:33.860 --> 2:22:40.180]  to speak to you and to your audience we are definitely facing a turning point in history
[2:22:40.180 --> 2:22:48.900]  the pope itself like like we said when I was with you in Rome will become a figure that will start
[2:22:48.900 --> 2:22:58.900]  to become very far from his divine appointment he is kind of like giving up on on hope of
[2:22:59.940 --> 2:23:06.740]  staying there until the end of his mandate it's pretty clear now that even Megan Kelly I mean
[2:23:06.740 --> 2:23:13.380]  I'm not talking about a big vatican expert and you of course know her too so she came out
[2:23:14.820 --> 2:23:20.180]  while in Rome stating that there is something that is going on in the vatican right now
[2:23:20.180 --> 2:23:26.660]  and I can definitely confirm that they are preparing for the pope to resign but not before
[2:23:26.660 --> 2:23:35.060]  he appoints the last progressive cardinals that will define the next paper see it's a little bit
[2:23:35.060 --> 2:23:43.220]  like the supreme court here in the US if you have it filled with progressive members it will
[2:23:43.220 --> 2:23:49.860]  act in a way if you have it with republicans in another way so he is being actually staying
[2:23:49.860 --> 2:23:58.500]  in his position only because Ratzinger is still there and Ratzinger behind the scenes could still
[2:23:58.500 --> 2:24:06.180]  be a threat that's why during the pandemic he's been increasingly isolating the now former pope
[2:24:06.180 --> 2:24:12.900]  and in the meantime he got sick he got sick with the colon cancer that got pretty bad last year
[2:24:12.900 --> 2:24:20.020]  the vatican has done everything possible to cover up the the situation which now sees really the
[2:24:20.020 --> 2:24:27.620]  pope in a wheelchair so it's pretty evident he had to also cancel a trip to Africa that he was
[2:24:27.620 --> 2:24:35.060]  planning for a long time which was also a way for him to introduce the next pontificate which will
[2:24:35.060 --> 2:24:41.300]  be definitely in the hands of an african pope so this is what's going on in the vatican he's
[2:24:41.300 --> 2:24:50.900]  waiting august to nominate these other cardinals that he will need so he can basically program the
[2:24:50.900 --> 2:24:57.700]  next papacy in line with his own and then he's gonna resign so there is not much left to this
[2:24:57.700 --> 2:25:04.980]  papacy that will probably probably end up in august maximum in september i know that we've
[2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:11.300]  been saying this before that he will resign but he has been resisting because he of course wanted
[2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:20.340]  to wait for the death of ratzinger but ratzinger is still there so that's about it he's resisting
[2:25:20.340 --> 2:25:29.620]  until on august 27th he will be nominating 21 new cardinals of which 16 will be progressively
[2:25:29.620 --> 2:25:36.580]  in cardinals under the age of 80 that will be eligible to vote in a future conclave and that's
[2:25:37.380 --> 2:25:43.220]  about it alex what do you make of him coming out as you know a month ago and saying okay
[2:25:43.220 --> 2:25:48.260]  nato started the war we need him at peace till russia they got almost no no coverage but he said
[2:25:48.260 --> 2:25:55.140]  that officially what does that signify well of course behind the scenes that the pope has really
[2:25:55.140 --> 2:26:04.500]  tried in some way to open a line of dialogue with the orthodox leadership in moscow but that
[2:26:04.500 --> 2:26:10.740]  failed miserably so at the moment he's using the knights of malta that have a long-standing
[2:26:10.740 --> 2:26:17.780]  tradition in russia for a direct line of communication with putin he really relies a lot
[2:26:17.780 --> 2:26:24.100]  on the russians also for his own interest but i'm talking about interest i'm talking about
[2:26:24.100 --> 2:26:31.380]  tourism in italy in religious places is mainly russian so he's losing a lot of money but
[2:26:32.180 --> 2:26:38.740]  he is also interested of course in siding with the china which of course behind the scenes also
[2:26:38.740 --> 2:26:49.140]  sides with russia so and while he of course in front of the general public had to agree to
[2:26:49.140 --> 2:26:55.460]  sustain ukraine and he did it quite blatantly by showing even the flag of the ground forces of
[2:26:55.460 --> 2:27:03.460]  ukraine so pretty much in line with nato behind the scenes things are different there is actually
[2:27:03.460 --> 2:27:12.020]  a pope that is part of an order the jazzwights that also have a very much a long story with russia
[2:27:12.020 --> 2:27:18.420]  when the jazzwights were persecuted by the Vatican at one point it seems strange now we have a
[2:27:18.420 --> 2:27:26.100]  jazzway pope they took refuge in russia and was actually catering the great that gave them refuge
[2:27:26.100 --> 2:27:33.300]  so he has definitely is trying behind the scenes to maintain this line of communication
[2:27:33.300 --> 2:27:41.700]  and the knights of malta also have undergone in the last few weeks a internal coup because
[2:27:42.420 --> 2:27:48.660]  the pope nominated the john t dunlap a member of the sovereign council and lieutenant now of the
[2:27:48.660 --> 2:27:55.540]  gun master because there is no master at the moment in the knights of malta and as you know for the
[2:27:55.540 --> 2:28:03.460]  last few years the jazzwights who are traditionally controlling of everything have tried also to
[2:28:03.460 --> 2:28:08.980]  take control of the sovereign order of the knights of malta when i say sovereign is very important
[2:28:08.980 --> 2:28:14.260]  to underline sovereign because they have their own sovereignty which is separate from the Vatican
[2:28:14.260 --> 2:28:20.260]  and even their own state even if it's a microstate you remember when we were in Rome at one point
[2:28:20.260 --> 2:28:25.540]  they brought you inside the headquarters of the knights of the holy sepulcher that itself is also
[2:28:25.540 --> 2:28:32.980]  another microstate so these are states that are separate from the italian jurisdiction and belong
[2:28:32.980 --> 2:28:41.380]  to these important knighthoods now the sovereign order of malta has a former wealth former royal
[2:28:41.380 --> 2:28:46.820]  who is still a prince stand stand there leo zogami explain what this means geopolitically this is big
[2:28:46.820 --> 2:28:51.700]  to the whole future of the world and people aren't talking about it leo zogami is our guest we're right

[2:32:09.380 --> 2:32:14.660]  the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with
[2:32:14.660 --> 2:32:20.660]  sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[2:32:20.660 --> 2:32:28.180]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think i'm 55 years old and i was already
[2:32:28.180 --> 2:32:32.820]  taking your other supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[2:32:32.820 --> 2:32:37.300]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it i mean it doesn't happen
[2:32:37.300 --> 2:32:43.700]  immediately but you know over a period of time i started noticing okay you know this is a ticket
[2:32:43.700 --> 2:32:49.540]  this is working this is wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on derma blend anymore
[2:32:49.540 --> 2:32:54.660]  you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[2:32:54.660 --> 2:33:04.260]  and leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:04.260 --> 2:33:25.780]  you are listening to an infowars dot com front line report if you are receiving this transmission
[2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:32.500]  you are the resistance so there are big shake ups around the world happening right now but what
[2:33:32.500 --> 2:33:39.700]  does it mean that this globalist pope is reportedly getting ready to step down leo zigami i can ask a
[2:33:39.700 --> 2:33:44.660]  lot of questions but front and center you were on a few years ago you predicted the whole globalist
[2:33:44.660 --> 2:33:51.380]  agenda those videos have since gone viral what are you predicting now is about to happen how
[2:33:51.380 --> 2:33:55.780]  is the great reset going are they planning new pandemics as biden says what do you think is
[2:33:55.780 --> 2:34:00.260]  coming next and just cover the waterfront anything you want to cover instead of my questions give us
[2:34:00.260 --> 2:34:09.140]  the data done my friend okay alex well first of all as you know this crisis will create a massive
[2:34:09.940 --> 2:34:17.540]  migration from africa for example because of the grains and flowers that are no longer
[2:34:17.540 --> 2:34:24.580]  coming from ukraine and for that reason of course the the papacy will be incented it will be focused
[2:34:24.580 --> 2:34:31.860]  on africa with an african pope that's it's it's almost like they are preparing this whole thing
[2:34:31.860 --> 2:34:39.300]  and at the same time we have of course the escalation in the last couple of days regarding
[2:34:39.300 --> 2:34:48.580]  kaliningrad the kaliningrad is a small enclave that used to be under the control a long time ago of
[2:34:48.580 --> 2:34:55.300]  the teutonic knights is on the Baltic sea it's russia but is surrounded by nato countries by
[2:34:55.300 --> 2:35:04.420]  lituania by poland and now they have stopped the import of goods from russia by train that is basically
[2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:12.740]  a violation for russia of all treaties and it also forces russia to intervene now the spokesperson
[2:35:12.740 --> 2:35:19.540]  for the foreign ministry of russia has just said that they will intervene basically militarily that
[2:35:19.540 --> 2:35:25.700]  is of an enormous gravity and i don't really know why most of the media today in america are not
[2:35:25.700 --> 2:35:32.900]  talking about it because we are literally facing now an even worse scenario than ukraine than ukraine
[2:35:32.900 --> 2:35:41.380]  because ukraine is not nato instead lituania is nato so that will be automatically america
[2:35:41.380 --> 2:35:49.140]  intervening in the swore and the consequences of course will be disastrous the pope behind the scene
[2:35:49.140 --> 2:35:55.860]  is trying diplomatically various moves but they were rejected like i said previously by the
[2:35:55.860 --> 2:36:03.140]  orthodox leadership by patryarch kiril and so at the at the moment is trying other ways but there
[2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:11.300]  is a sense of desperation almost because there is also a prophecy that was said a long time
[2:36:11.300 --> 2:36:17.940]  ago a prophecy one of these marion apparition of the holy mary in garand bandal and in these
[2:36:17.940 --> 2:36:25.060]  apparitions they said the moment in which the pope ever steps in moscow that will be the beginning
[2:36:25.060 --> 2:36:31.540]  of of the end for mankind and these visions are considered legitimate by saints of the catholic
[2:36:31.540 --> 2:36:41.700]  church like patrypia or even mother theresa of calcutta so we are really facing some incredible
[2:36:41.700 --> 2:36:48.980]  times and we need to be ready like you said before i started my segment storeable food is
[2:36:48.980 --> 2:36:57.540]  essential i have my own bucket from infowars right here and i suggest everybody has to do the same
[2:36:57.540 --> 2:37:06.500]  because we have to also be ready energetically maybe with some kind of a generator because
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:13.620]  there will be definitely some big changes in the horizon in the next few months and at the same
[2:37:13.620 --> 2:37:21.540]  time we will see the pope stepping down but we will see also the queen fading out gradually out
[2:37:21.540 --> 2:37:25.060]  of that's right they say she's about to step down like it's all the planets are aligning
[2:37:25.060 --> 2:37:34.900]  yes so basically a new a new king in england a new pope in rome we are living times of great
[2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:41.140]  changes so what is going to happen to us if we are not ready we need absolutely to prepare
[2:37:41.940 --> 2:37:49.460]  because the big seat is especially like i explained in my latest book which talks about
[2:37:49.460 --> 2:37:58.340]  the great reject away in which we can reject the the great reset which is taking place and in europe
[2:37:58.340 --> 2:38:05.620]  for example they are already discussing the possibility in the next few months of rationing
[2:38:05.620 --> 2:38:15.700]  electricity rationing gas is almost impossible to think that russia will not completely cut the gas
[2:38:15.700 --> 2:38:21.380]  towards the countries like italy and let's expand on that that was my next question i'm glad you
[2:38:21.380 --> 2:38:27.380]  brought that up we have the admissions that russia is now the biggest oil exporter the us just two
[2:38:27.380 --> 2:38:35.140]  years ago was the biggest in saudi arabia then russia now under biden the us is third russia is
[2:38:35.140 --> 2:38:42.180]  about to replace saudi arabia as the major oil exporter the globalist obviously knew this would
[2:38:42.180 --> 2:38:48.340]  make russia the biggest exporter and now india one of the biggest refiners what's the big picture
[2:38:48.340 --> 2:38:56.420]  there behind the scenes well business has actually increased for russia they are not suffering from
[2:38:56.420 --> 2:39:01.220]  the sanctions because they're simply selling their oil to china the only problem might be
[2:39:02.420 --> 2:39:09.460]  in the next couple of years to uh readdress the course of their gas pipelines because that's a
[2:39:09.460 --> 2:39:15.860]  little bit more complicated but having said that we are definitely sanctioning ourselves with these
[2:39:15.860 --> 2:39:21.380]  sanctions not russia because they are simply changing the name of mcdonald to something else
[2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:25.140]  and by the way biden mentioned that he says it's part of the great reset he says it's good for
[2:39:25.140 --> 2:39:29.380]  you to transition but they're not giving us anything to transition for so while they claim
[2:39:29.380 --> 2:39:35.220]  they're defending america aren't they really selling us out they are absolutely selling us out
[2:39:35.220 --> 2:39:42.180]  and they are of course planning to starve a lot of america like they're planning to start most of
[2:39:42.180 --> 2:39:51.060]  the population of this planet let's not forget that now famine and after we had of course the
[2:39:51.060 --> 2:39:56.500]  bacteriological warfare which of course the biological warfare that we have seen with the
[2:39:56.500 --> 2:40:03.140]  virus and with the vaccines now we have also the famine the the possibility that the people will
[2:40:03.140 --> 2:40:10.580]  really be starving is a concrete possibility it's not just uh and i also notice another thing alex
[2:40:10.580 --> 2:40:18.420]  that the price increase of the food here in america is bigger than the price increase in europe
[2:40:18.420 --> 2:40:24.420]  which actually should be the opposite uh my i was speaking with my mother the other day and she
[2:40:24.420 --> 2:40:30.180]  told me about the price increases in the supermarkets in europe or europe and they were quite modest
[2:40:30.180 --> 2:40:35.780]  compared to what is happening here in america so there is a lot of speculation that is going on
[2:40:35.780 --> 2:40:43.940]  here in the united states of america and of course joe biden is simply a face for something
[2:40:43.940 --> 2:40:48.180]  that is very right he's a front guy what do you make of him falling off the bicycle
[2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:52.900]  complete deranged we have the queen getting ready to step down the pope getting ready to step down
[2:40:52.900 --> 2:40:58.820]  what is the exit strategy when you look into all your research for joe biden well you see they are
[2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:05.140]  uh uh depicting all the old folks as uh when you have a guy like joe biden he's giving a
[2:41:05.140 --> 2:41:11.300]  bad name to old people that's what he's doing because they are planning to remodel our society
[2:41:11.300 --> 2:41:21.780]  so then we can have young folks like zealinski uh people that are simply money judge behind the
[2:41:21.780 --> 2:41:28.180]  scenes that you will have basically the same old people but they will have this new front and and
[2:41:28.180 --> 2:41:34.740]  so at the moment for them to have a guy like joe biden showing that is virtually impossible
[2:41:34.740 --> 2:41:41.300]  to to to be in the white house at a certain age they are kind of mining the possibility for future
[2:41:41.300 --> 2:41:48.580]  presidents including of course the comeback of donald j trump amazing leo zegami final

[2:47:36.340 --> 2:47:41.460]  they've officially become state-run apple 100 google is now making the transition and
[2:47:41.460 --> 2:47:47.220]  announcing a merger in total worldwide censorship they are now beta testing using me as the straw
[2:47:47.220 --> 2:47:51.860]  man a demonized version of alex jones to do that this is happening this is not like the other
[2:47:51.860 --> 2:47:56.660]  probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship thinking you would adapt
[2:47:56.660 --> 2:48:02.260]  to censorship by just putting up with it now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands
[2:48:02.260 --> 2:48:08.100]  of times the magnitude of all previous attacks this is a titrated dose reverse psychological
[2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:14.580]  warfare operation using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation in layman's
[2:48:14.580 --> 2:48:19.140]  terms they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed we adapt to being pressed
[2:48:19.140 --> 2:48:25.380]  with the low dosages of oppression now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover we try to
[2:48:25.380 --> 2:48:32.420]  adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose total
[2:48:32.420 --> 2:48:37.460]  internet of things integration global social score complete command and control system it is the
[2:48:37.460 --> 2:48:43.140]  virtual reality ai weapon system now attacking the united states with traders inside the major
[2:48:43.140 --> 2:48:48.260]  security agencies blocking trumps resistance of the program and attempting to stop us from removing
[2:48:48.260 --> 2:48:53.300]  the tentacles of the chai com slash big tech begging combine emergency situation i have been
[2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:57.460]  chosen for destruction because i brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out
[2:48:57.460 --> 2:49:03.940]  as much as i can they want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical
[2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:09.460]  deception where every angle of my good is turned against us so they take what i've said being
[2:49:09.460 --> 2:49:14.740]  sincere building into an insincere person in the straw man i'm a person that cares about life and
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:19.300]  children and is against these wars and so they make me a murder of children and then they build me
[2:49:19.300 --> 2:49:24.420]  into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a
[2:49:24.420 --> 2:49:30.260]  debate about alex jones so even if i didn't sell out to them they've now used me as an archetype
[2:49:30.260 --> 2:49:36.900]  to serve them by being the main distraction i have now been captured by the enemy in the information
[2:49:36.900 --> 2:49:42.580]  warfare fulcrum has been used against you only your full understanding of this key will break you
[2:49:42.580 --> 2:49:47.300]  free from this paradigm i have given you the transmission now break free
[2:49:50.900 --> 2:49:58.500]  i have sworn upon the altar of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[2:49:58.500 --> 2:50:14.100]  mind of man thomas jefferson if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance all right
[2:50:14.100 --> 2:50:18.100]  final segment leo zegami got a guest host the fourth hour though insured at three p.m. today
[2:50:20.420 --> 2:50:25.620]  jack was so big and others have tweeted out the link to the film alex's war that some great
[2:50:25.620 --> 2:50:30.580]  documentary filmmakers made shown what we've really done over the last 28 years we appreciate jack
[2:50:30.580 --> 2:50:36.020]  for something putting that out and others the film is linked up on info wars dot com the the
[2:50:36.020 --> 2:50:43.380]  trailer to the film so in the eight minutes we have left leo zegami big picture what would you
[2:50:43.380 --> 2:50:48.340]  describe the world as right now and where it's going and other key key points you'd like to impart
[2:50:48.340 --> 2:50:55.860]  to people well like i just said before the break there is an increasingly amount of fully vaccinated
[2:50:55.860 --> 2:51:02.500]  people that are basically giving showing strong signs of demonic possessions and that's why the
[2:51:02.500 --> 2:51:09.620]  catholic church is actually opening a center in the philippines a worldwide unique kind of center
[2:51:09.620 --> 2:51:17.380]  dedicated to exorcism because there is really this link and also this another link the lockdowns
[2:51:17.380 --> 2:51:25.380]  have also generated the isolation and an increased amount of people that are fighting with their
[2:51:25.380 --> 2:51:33.460]  demons or fighting with demons depending on your point of view so we are really in front of the
[2:51:33.460 --> 2:51:39.380]  population of the world being increasingly possessed we are of course facing all this
[2:51:39.380 --> 2:51:47.940]  evil from the big pharma because it all generates from that flexner report from 1910 when they
[2:51:47.940 --> 2:51:56.340]  basically started to deriding eclectic medicines osteopathy homopathy they destroyed natural medicine
[2:51:56.340 --> 2:52:02.980]  and then they went on to establish their big pharma but the big pharma is also linked with
[2:52:02.980 --> 2:52:10.100]  the demonic so it's quite incredible that father joseph francisco sica has actually admitted this
[2:52:10.100 --> 2:52:17.060]  link because at the same time today i also published an article showing that the Vatican has
[2:52:17.060 --> 2:52:25.540]  actually minted new coins blessing the covid-19 vaccination with this is kind of incredible
[2:52:25.540 --> 2:52:31.620]  that the Vatican is putting out a coin that by the way is a 20 euro coin so that's over
[2:52:31.620 --> 2:52:37.140]  20 dollars and with the rising inflation we start figuring out that they're getting ready for it
[2:52:37.140 --> 2:52:43.220]  where basically 20 dollars or 20 euros would just be a coin imagine that alex
[2:52:45.140 --> 2:52:51.940]  and on top of all of this of course the architect of manila and the office of exorcism that they
[2:52:51.940 --> 2:52:58.180]  are establishing said that the demons are also linked with the electrical world with the the
[2:52:58.180 --> 2:53:06.740]  technological world and after an exorcism the chief exorcist denounced that demons were actually
[2:53:07.380 --> 2:53:13.780]  even sending messages to his mobile phone i know that this might sound incredible but this was
[2:53:14.660 --> 2:53:21.620]  said by father joseph francisco sica who is the chief exorcist of this facility so it's not something
[2:53:21.620 --> 2:53:29.460]  that i'm making up there is definitely a society where aggressive satanism and demonic possession
[2:53:29.460 --> 2:53:37.060]  is in the increase at the same time we are viewing all the characteristics of this end time scenario
[2:53:37.060 --> 2:53:45.300]  where we are facing the end of the of of the western civilization as we know it but also over
[2:53:45.300 --> 2:53:52.340]  this american-centric new world order which is leaning now like i also specified already in
[2:53:52.340 --> 2:53:59.140]  february towards a sino russian new world order what does that mean it means that of course next
[2:53:59.140 --> 2:54:05.860]  we're also going to be facing the invasion of taiwan which is going to be of course like the
[2:54:06.420 --> 2:54:12.100]  ukraine of the east the the problem being though that like joe biden already said
[2:54:12.100 --> 2:54:20.020]  that america's pledge to defend taiwan so that will be definitely a direct conf confront i mean
[2:54:20.020 --> 2:54:26.660]  that they will bring us in a direct war with china a world that we can't afford we can hardly afford
[2:54:27.220 --> 2:54:33.300]  a confrontation of this kind even if it's not a direct war with russia it will be
[2:54:33.300 --> 2:54:40.500]  inimaginable to think that we are also in war with china because that will completely bankrupt
[2:54:40.500 --> 2:54:45.060]  our whole season which is the plan to bring in the world government the new cashless society
[2:54:45.860 --> 2:54:52.020]  new programmable digital token social credit score they've announced absolutely absolutely so
[2:54:52.020 --> 2:54:56.980]  none of this makes sense for prosperity or peace or a good future but it makes sense to the new
[2:54:56.980 --> 2:55:02.500]  world order don't we expose their agenda then is there any way to get the globalists to stop doing
[2:55:02.500 --> 2:55:10.100]  this at the local level there is some initiatives that we can take here in the united states of
[2:55:10.100 --> 2:55:20.740]  america where we have a federal system which is open to independence from counties from cities even
[2:55:20.740 --> 2:55:25.860]  without reaching the whole of a state the sand is a great example of that but the power has to be
[2:55:25.860 --> 2:55:32.660]  exercised by we the people through local government yes we the people also have to understand that
[2:55:32.660 --> 2:55:41.060]  probably the cities are lost the cities unfortunately are in the hands of the enemy and most of them
[2:55:41.060 --> 2:55:48.100]  are in the hands of course of the demon crats and i don't think we can recover the city so we need to
[2:55:48.100 --> 2:55:53.780]  prepare our reality outside of these cities this is something i always stress and i will continue
[2:55:53.780 --> 2:55:58.420]  to stress and let's be clear the globalists can't help but abuse and suck off of and destroy
[2:55:58.420 --> 2:56:03.380]  that you have control of so if we can just remove ourselves while they collapse things they'll destroy
[2:56:03.380 --> 2:56:08.740]  the cities we will then inherit them people think oh god got the cities no just stand back while they
[2:56:08.740 --> 2:56:14.820]  destroy it and then they'll burn themselves out well we hope they will do that but there is also
[2:56:14.820 --> 2:56:19.940]  a problem here alex that the cities might become smart cities in the hand of cybersatan and his
[2:56:19.940 --> 2:56:25.540]  robots so it's going to be a little bit difficult when we have that in place because we are all
[2:56:25.540 --> 2:56:32.180]  moving like you also said towards a reality which artificial intelligence is all controlling and
[2:56:32.180 --> 2:56:38.580]  all encompassing especially when we make the next move towards transhumanism which is that move also
[2:56:38.580 --> 2:56:45.300]  which i talk about in my book from the internet of things to the internet of body i mean the
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:51.540]  internet of bodies meaning that we are actually interacting with our own bodies with the artificial
[2:56:51.540 --> 2:56:55.700]  intelligence and that's very impressive leo i said this to you a year ago i said it again
[2:56:55.700 --> 2:57:00.580]  we're carrying some of your books i need to carry the new book but we want to get you back on about
[2:57:00.580 --> 2:57:06.740]  the very system and the mindset of the enemies of humanity but regardless huge things are afoot
[2:57:06.740 --> 2:57:11.300]  the queen of me looking ready to step down the pope getting ready to step down biden in deep
[2:57:11.300 --> 2:57:17.140]  trouble all of this is incredibly important leo zegami thank you so much thank you god bless you
[2:57:17.140 --> 2:57:23.220]  all right kate dally is about to take over and then on shroyer in one hour and just remember
[2:57:23.220 --> 2:57:28.500]  the enemy works around the clock to stop these broadcasts so when you spread the word and share
[2:57:28.500 --> 2:57:34.180]  the live links in full wars dot com forward slash show and bandot video it changes the world great

[2:57:49.940 --> 2:57:54.820]  with the slogan alec shones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually
[2:57:54.820 --> 2:58:01.300]  very sick feeling because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked
[2:58:01.300 --> 2:58:07.460]  about is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in
[2:58:07.460 --> 2:58:14.500]  policy reports and documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the
[2:58:14.500 --> 2:58:21.540]  earth the bilderberg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making
[2:58:21.540 --> 2:58:25.940]  their move because they know they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching
[2:58:25.940 --> 2:58:29.620]  the children are counting on us i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of
[2:58:29.620 --> 2:58:34.500]  mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you info wars would not be here
[2:58:34.500 --> 2:58:39.460]  so i want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason
[2:58:39.460 --> 2:58:43.620]  humanity has a fighting chance so i want to thank you and salute you again for all you've
[2:58:43.620 --> 2:58:50.740]  done and ask you now to redouble your efforts i'm a humble person and i want to say that i'm just a
[2:58:50.740 --> 2:58:57.300]  man but i'm not just a man just like you no matter what color you are whether you're a man or a woman
[2:58:57.300 --> 2:59:02.500]  you were made by the creator of the universe who had a plan for you who has a destiny for you
[2:59:02.500 --> 2:59:08.260]  you that's why the system hates you and fears you that's why they hate me it's because the spirit
[2:59:08.260 --> 2:59:14.900]  i carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and will and love my friends the enemy
[2:59:14.900 --> 2:59:20.100]  is coming after me not because i'm a loser but because i'm a winner they're coming after you
[2:59:20.100 --> 2:59:26.020]  not because you're a bad person because you're a good person and because you love god and god
[2:59:26.020 --> 2:59:31.300]  loves you and so i signed up for this i signed up for this fight and i'm not a victim i'm an
[2:59:31.300 --> 2:59:36.020]  overcomer but i can't fight this fight without you that's why i want you always remember that i
[2:59:36.020 --> 2:59:40.980]  appreciate you and i thank you because info wars is your fight info wars is your baby it's the thing
[2:59:40.980 --> 2:59:51.300]  you built we did this together so god bless you all let's keep fighting if you are receiving this
[2:59:51.300 --> 3:00:05.060]  transmission you are the resistance hey everybody how are you thank you alex i'm kate dally i am
[3:00:05.060 --> 3:00:09.620]  from kate dally radio dot com and of course sitting in on the alex jones show today and
[3:00:09.620 --> 3:00:15.220]  appreciate that i appreciate you listening to there's so many topics at hand i get it um i mean
[3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:20.340]  our food shortages look really dire i'm talking to farmers all over and it's quite a mess and it
[3:00:20.340 --> 3:00:25.700]  will be a mess for 2023 and i think that's when we're really going to see it peak is this fall
[3:00:25.700 --> 3:00:29.780]  and winter we'll probably see a little bit of that and then going into next year from what my
[3:00:29.780 --> 3:00:36.340]  farmers are telling me also um everyone's pretty horrid at the pump you should be i am and uh and
[3:00:36.340 --> 3:00:40.420]  then of course uh they're getting desperate to get those shots in our arms even all the way down to
[3:00:40.420 --> 3:00:46.180]  babies now having uh the fda approval whatever that means because they're so corrupt but the fda
[3:00:46.180 --> 3:00:52.420]  approval of babies even though the Pfizer documentation is still leaking out and still quite
[3:00:53.540 --> 3:00:58.100]  nefarious and horrifying to tell you the truth i've been reading through those documents and
[3:00:58.100 --> 3:01:04.180]  it's so horrifying what they're trying to hide um again it can ruin your immune system it can bring
[3:01:04.180 --> 3:01:08.820]  on cancer it can bring on autoimmune i mean there's so many things that can happen um from
[3:01:08.820 --> 3:01:13.540]  destroying our immune systems which is really what's going on with those shots but today i want to
[3:01:13.540 --> 3:01:19.780]  talk about two things uh that don't get talked a lot one is about our history that never gets a light
[3:01:19.780 --> 3:01:25.460]  uh shan on it and then also i want to talk a little bit about ufo's i know you heard me ufo's
[3:01:25.460 --> 3:01:29.780]  but there's a reason i want to talk about that and i want to talk about something um that's
[3:01:29.780 --> 3:01:36.500]  coming because i think it's really important um to kind of keep your eye on it so i have what's
[3:01:36.500 --> 3:01:43.940]  called freedom Tourette's i can't stop saying things that are true in the face of not being
[3:01:43.940 --> 3:01:49.780]  popular and of course this month the month of june every company is going all in so that they can
[3:01:49.780 --> 3:01:54.740]  get money on the in the future for the great reset so they're going all in for this month of june you
[3:01:54.740 --> 3:01:59.300]  know what i'm talking about and it's really hard to watch this in our country watch this happen
[3:01:59.300 --> 3:02:06.180]  but what's interesting to me is this last june 10th um on monday and the banks were closed
[3:02:06.180 --> 3:02:12.260]  and the mail didn't come and everything else and and this holiday is so well only a total
[3:02:12.260 --> 3:02:18.180]  libtard can can make sense out of the fact that you go around destroying every monument
[3:02:18.980 --> 3:02:25.300]  every monument um that has even sometimes little to do with slavery right only to build
[3:02:25.300 --> 3:02:33.060]  up a holiday that reminds you of slavery yeah i mean sometimes there's just i don't even know what to
[3:02:33.060 --> 3:02:38.100]  say to libtards anymore i have a really hard time discussing anything with them because they're afraid
[3:02:38.100 --> 3:02:43.940]  the climate's going to come get them every decade and then also uh i don't know they're just a they're
[3:02:43.940 --> 3:02:50.020]  just a whole different class of people so i have a really tough time i apologize um but they don't
[3:02:50.020 --> 3:02:55.620]  know their history many people don't know our history and um and i didn't even know our history
[3:02:55.620 --> 3:03:00.740]  until i had to dive in and start studying it and realizing what a gift america has been to the world
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:08.740]  the establishment of the constitution if anything we should be always congratulating the constitution
[3:03:08.740 --> 3:03:15.220]  that set the pace for the rest of the world in getting rid of worldwide slavery after centuries
[3:03:15.220 --> 3:03:19.780]  we never talk about that we only talk about big bad america and their slaves well the problem
[3:03:19.780 --> 3:03:25.300]  was was it was going on for the for the whites the purples the blacks the asians the you name it
[3:03:25.940 --> 3:03:32.900]  you name it the irish you name it we had slaves all the way along and so from the irish slaves
[3:03:32.900 --> 3:03:39.300]  to the welsh miners to the black africans to the roman slaves slavery was a mindset and a product
[3:03:39.300 --> 3:03:43.940]  of humanity whether we want to look at that or not that was centuries old right and then it took
[3:03:43.940 --> 3:03:49.140]  the founding of america to finally become the domino effect around the world and a lot of kids
[3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:54.020]  do not know what i'm about to talk about on the show they do not know this piece of history
[3:03:54.020 --> 3:03:59.140]  maybe you don't know it i don't know hopefully we'll we'll be able to enlighten a few people today
[3:03:59.140 --> 3:04:07.060]  but in the past slavery was indentured servitude for the most part and indentured servitude
[3:04:07.060 --> 3:04:11.780]  it took about eight years ten years to earn your servitude and then you would be freed
[3:04:11.780 --> 3:04:16.820]  given a little bag of food and maybe some clothes and you were on your way and that was to pay your
[3:04:16.820 --> 3:04:21.060]  passage over how lovely of them right because they didn't come because some some of them because
[3:04:21.060 --> 3:04:27.780]  they obviously didn't want to but we brought them over anyway and so indentured servitude versus
[3:04:27.780 --> 3:04:32.740]  slavery is very very different and i want to talk about that when we come back because there's
[3:04:32.740 --> 3:04:38.580]  something i want to i want to talk about in slavery that happened in 1600 that kind of changed the
[3:04:38.580 --> 3:04:43.460]  face of everything so when you know this piece of history then everything else you can kind of
[3:04:43.460 --> 3:04:48.260]  look at america totally different we freed slavery within 80 years of the constitution
[3:04:48.260 --> 3:04:52.580]  being established pretty awesome i'll be right back i'm kate dally your guest host for the alex
[3:04:52.580 --> 3:05:01.700]  jones show i'll be right back cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very
[3:05:01.700 --> 3:05:07.540]  stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this
[3:05:07.540 --> 3:05:13.940]  degenerative mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com
[3:05:13.940 --> 3:05:20.100]  studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure
[3:05:20.100 --> 3:05:26.180]  decrease triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction
[3:05:26.180 --> 3:05:32.660]  in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested
[3:05:32.660 --> 3:05:39.700]  that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[3:05:39.700 --> 3:05:46.340]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm

[3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:07.860]  i kate dally back with you sitting in on the alex jones show and uh let me just tell you
[3:06:07.860 --> 3:06:13.380]  we have so much to go over today so much i want to bring you and this piece of history is so
[3:06:13.380 --> 3:06:19.140]  not known and i don't know why well i do know why concerted effort to change history starting in
[3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:26.580]  1907 but we have the notes to prove it but here we go so let's talk about this just a little bit
[3:06:26.580 --> 3:06:32.740]  so the first group of 20 slaves came over in the year 1600 and it was a one of one was a black man
[3:06:32.740 --> 3:06:38.260]  his name was anthony johnson anthony johnson did his servitude eight to ten years which was pretty
[3:06:38.260 --> 3:06:44.420]  typical in that time and earned his freedom and then he became very wealthy and bought other black
[3:06:44.420 --> 3:06:49.860]  slaves you never hear about this right okay he bought other black slaves and he bought another
[3:06:49.860 --> 3:06:56.580]  black man named john kasor and john kasor why is john kasor famous because his black master
[3:06:56.580 --> 3:07:03.940]  anthony johnson pursued a case in pennsylvania court that the idea that kasor should become
[3:07:03.940 --> 3:07:11.460]  a slave for life not just for the eight years and johnson won this so a black man owning a black man
[3:07:11.460 --> 3:07:16.980]  now for life instead of indentured servitude is what johnson got initially he was not going to
[3:07:16.980 --> 3:07:23.140]  give that same thing to kasor so kasor became a lifelong slave opening the door for the precedents
[3:07:23.140 --> 3:07:30.100]  that would include three million slaves owned for life throughout and up to 1863 many people do not
[3:07:30.100 --> 3:07:34.660]  know this i guarantee your kids were never taught this in school that it was a black man that went
[3:07:34.660 --> 3:07:42.500]  to court for a nether black man to become a slave for life not necessarily the white guy so in the
[3:07:42.500 --> 3:07:47.780]  south slavery was really evident but honestly when you really look at this situation and i'm not
[3:07:47.780 --> 3:07:54.420]  minimizing slavery so whatever i'm not minimizing it what i'm saying is only 347 thousand families
[3:07:54.420 --> 3:08:00.500]  owned slaves and they were primarily in the south and that was out of a population of 30 million
[3:08:00.500 --> 3:08:05.700]  americans just before the civil war so put that into perspective it was about three million slaves
[3:08:05.700 --> 3:08:14.340]  347 thousand families and out of the whole united states so america in its entirety did not own
[3:08:14.340 --> 3:08:19.220]  slaves especially up in the northern states the northern states so get a little more credit than
[3:08:19.220 --> 3:08:25.140]  they deserve and i'll tell you why slavery um was not kind of the national ideal it was in certain
[3:08:25.140 --> 3:08:31.380]  states and from the time the ink was dry on the constitution many white people in america uh fought
[3:08:31.380 --> 3:08:37.140]  to change hearts and minds it took about 80 years harriet tubman was born at the end of it and so
[3:08:37.140 --> 3:08:42.660]  she was not instrumental nor was she ever the face of it it was white quakers white quakers got
[3:08:42.660 --> 3:08:48.740]  together with their entire congregations risking their lives risking everything to form the underground
[3:08:48.740 --> 3:08:54.340]  railroad but that started when the constitution ink was dry because the all men created equal
[3:08:54.340 --> 3:09:02.260]  could never have happened overnight it had it had to happen over a series of time and so we know
[3:09:02.260 --> 3:09:06.340]  that we were setting that forward that george washington was very intent and here we're coming
[3:09:06.340 --> 3:09:11.540]  up on independence day so this is a great lesson for us they were very intent on putting all men
[3:09:11.540 --> 3:09:15.620]  created equal but they also knew it wasn't going to happen overnight george washington wanted to
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:21.380]  free his slaves as an example because really it was an industry thing it was this is how we make
[3:09:21.380 --> 3:09:27.700]  money we have these slaves again not saying it was great not saying it was right because slavery
[3:09:27.700 --> 3:09:32.740]  needed to be ended but it was only america that was going to change the face of what that looked
[3:09:32.740 --> 3:09:38.580]  like around the world because everybody used that as an example and stopped the practice that had
[3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:45.620]  been going on for centuries this is what we don't understand harriet tubman when i came along in the
[3:09:45.620 --> 3:09:50.980]  50 years after it had even been established the underground railroad mostly she got out
[3:09:50.980 --> 3:09:57.140]  her own family members it wasn't even a case of her going out and spending her entire life for
[3:09:57.140 --> 3:10:01.620]  all these other people mostly it was family but what's interesting is is they wanted to make
[3:10:01.620 --> 3:10:08.260]  her the face of it they wanted her to be the reason the underground railroad existed and so
[3:10:08.260 --> 3:10:13.780]  they the the white quakers and some slaves that had already been freed that had went up north
[3:10:13.780 --> 3:10:18.340]  went ahead and constructed the underground railroad think about it slaves could have never
[3:10:18.340 --> 3:10:23.940]  left their homes in order to construct such a railroad they never could have had the means to
[3:10:23.940 --> 3:10:29.700]  do it um or know who to trust it was the white quakers actually that did it and so that we're
[3:10:29.700 --> 3:10:34.020]  really really in charge of it and there's many stories along the way that prove that and talk
[3:10:34.020 --> 3:10:39.060]  about it in history if you look it up i go to periodicals i go to articles i go to things in
[3:10:39.060 --> 3:10:44.580]  the past to make sure i know what i'm talking about so that i can present that to you i wish
[3:10:44.580 --> 3:10:49.780]  more people could do that and so the movement was started in the late 1700s and then of course
[3:10:49.780 --> 3:10:55.700]  it only took 80 years for it to come to pass um but the civil war was not fought over slavery it
[3:10:55.700 --> 3:11:01.220]  was fought over really profit and money it was fought over the south uh remaining independent
[3:11:01.220 --> 3:11:06.260]  and being able to profit and so there were a lot of issues at stake it was more of a state's thing
[3:11:06.260 --> 3:11:12.740]  than it was um we did not want to become the federal the over cumbersome federal united states
[3:11:12.740 --> 3:11:20.020]  okay and so now that we know this even lynching came from a word um that word came from a man
[3:11:20.020 --> 3:11:26.820]  named willy lynch who back in colonial america was asked to share his diabolical methods for
[3:11:26.820 --> 3:11:34.020]  slave treatment such as lynching with the colonials who owned slaves and so he was basically lynching
[3:11:34.020 --> 3:11:39.540]  the irish and then the colonials asked him well how do you do that what's going on with that but
[3:11:39.540 --> 3:11:45.780]  isn't it interesting that it was practiced on the white irish first that word came from the white
[3:11:45.780 --> 3:11:51.940]  irish and uh did not originate with the slaves here um so there's a lot of correction in history
[3:11:51.940 --> 3:11:58.020]  that we need to do but when it comes to juneteenth here's a great statement from brian mclanahan
[3:11:58.020 --> 3:12:04.980]  historian he said hereditary uh slavery did not end in the united states until december 6th remember
[3:12:04.980 --> 3:12:11.940]  that date 1865 the ratification date of the 13th amendment slave auctions continued in kentucky
[3:12:11.940 --> 3:12:18.820]  until november 1865 about two years later five months after slavery supposedly was supposed
[3:12:18.820 --> 3:12:25.460]  to end on june 19th 1865 so if the last slaves were told they were free on june 19th then what
[3:12:25.460 --> 3:12:30.980]  about all the slaves sold into slavery after that point because it was taking place well that would
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:38.260]  be news to them and so delaware kentucky and new jersey all slave states in 1865 actually rejected
[3:12:38.260 --> 3:12:44.660]  the 13th amendment to the constitution they rejected it and slavery was legal in each state until
[3:12:44.660 --> 3:12:53.300]  december 6 months after june 19th 1865 so it's really strange oh by the way delaware kentucky
[3:12:53.300 --> 3:12:59.620]  and new jersey were technically all union states oh i thought the union was fighting to free the
[3:12:59.620 --> 3:13:06.580]  slaves why would they reject the 13th amendment good question so during the war though kentucky
[3:13:06.580 --> 3:13:12.500]  was a special case could be considered a confederate state maybe only mississippi rejected the 13th
[3:13:12.500 --> 3:13:18.180]  amendment from the former confederate states people don't know this but this is our history
[3:13:18.180 --> 3:13:22.660]  and i hope that we can share our history with our kids and grandkids because we're losing a lot of
[3:13:22.660 --> 3:13:27.780]  time and we're losing a lot of this to the progressive left globalist communists that are
[3:13:27.780 --> 3:13:33.060]  trying to destroy the country and what are they doing destroying our history tearing down monuments
[3:13:33.060 --> 3:13:38.580]  yet they want to make the biggest federal holiday they can out of juneteenth not only does it have
[3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:44.900]  a ridiculous name they would love to co-op this and instead of having independence day they would
[3:13:44.900 --> 3:13:51.300]  love it to just be juneteenth which is absolutely asinine on so many levels because all it does is
[3:13:51.300 --> 3:13:58.260]  say i'm ignorant about my history and i don't know much because if they really knew what america's
[3:13:58.260 --> 3:14:05.220]  role was in this and how much of that role was given to all of those quakers all the way along
[3:14:05.220 --> 3:14:10.100]  the early 1800s and mid 1800s you'd feel a lot different about this country wouldn't you it's
[3:14:10.100 --> 3:14:16.340]  so odd to me well not odd because i expect them to want to destroy our history but our history came
[3:14:16.340 --> 3:14:22.740]  um at the hands of 1907 started getting destroyed through many of our non-profit organizations
[3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:28.980]  that we know so well and uh and they did a damn good job didn't they because in high school you'd
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:34.180]  probably never learned what i just talked about on the air probably not i'm gonna guess that you
[3:14:34.180 --> 3:14:41.380]  didn't and that it was a black man that went to court in pennsylvania to own another black man for
[3:14:41.380 --> 3:14:49.300]  life when was the last time you saw that on a t-shirt you didn't and so juneteenth is um absolutely
[3:14:49.300 --> 3:14:55.220]  asinine that we're celebrating this really all credit is due and goes back to the constitution
[3:14:55.220 --> 3:15:00.820]  and goes back to the men who decided that we were going to put our people in charge of our own
[3:15:00.820 --> 3:15:06.180]  government and that we were not going to let kings rule us anymore because the reason slavery
[3:15:06.180 --> 3:15:12.820]  progressed through the centuries is we had kings by decree that said that that said that that
[3:15:12.820 --> 3:15:18.660]  slavery became a thing and it became a mindset it's hard to change a mindset really tough it takes
[3:15:18.660 --> 3:15:24.420]  decades and decades to do it so it's no wonder that it took 80 years but here's the thing it only
[3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:30.020]  took 80 years it didn't take 300 they act like it took 300 we're still fighting for this it's
[3:15:30.020 --> 3:15:35.300]  ridiculous when was the last time you saw a brawl break out between blacks and whites for the cause
[3:15:35.300 --> 3:15:41.780]  of racism in an airport in an airplane in a grocery store you don't see it because we're not a racist
[3:15:41.780 --> 3:15:47.220]  country we just keep getting fed the lie that we are and so we have to counteract that i'm going
[3:15:47.220 --> 3:15:54.020]  to be right back i'm k dally from kdally radio dot com in for the alex jones show i'll be right

[3:20:12.660 --> 3:20:17.780]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm k dally your guest host and happy to be here thanks alex
[3:20:17.780 --> 3:20:24.660]  uh and so by the way get those supplements i would order as much as you possibly can right now
[3:20:24.660 --> 3:20:31.060]  after talking to farmers across the country as the shortages were about to see i would actually
[3:20:31.060 --> 3:20:36.020]  this summer i would order up i'd order extra antibiotics have them on hand i'd would order
[3:20:36.020 --> 3:20:42.420]  extra extra everything extra supplements the supplements that alex has are really great
[3:20:42.420 --> 3:20:46.980]  they are fantastic quality and i would get a lot of them i really would and i would stock
[3:20:46.980 --> 3:20:53.460]  up your shelves as much as you possibly can it'll keep on the shelf um so let's talk ufo's this is
[3:20:53.460 --> 3:20:59.940]  not going to be a popular subject with some people because um i have a very different view on ufo's
[3:20:59.940 --> 3:21:04.900]  and i don't believe in them and so right away if you're going how could you not believe in them
[3:21:04.900 --> 3:21:10.820]  i'm going to lay out my case i do a lot of research and after tens of thousands of hours of research
[3:21:10.820 --> 3:21:16.580]  i can tell you that i was i used to be very open to the thought of it and then after a lot of
[3:21:16.580 --> 3:21:23.380]  homework no way sorry we're being sold a box of rocks but i i want to lay out my case and then
[3:21:23.380 --> 3:21:28.740]  you can decide um so i have this t-shirt on and this t-shirt says the end is near i love this
[3:21:28.740 --> 3:21:33.140]  t-shirt makes me laugh for a totally different reason than probably people are buying it has
[3:21:33.140 --> 3:21:39.620]  a picture of a spaceship on it and there's more truth to this there's more truth to this t-shirt
[3:21:39.620 --> 3:21:46.660]  than people realize okay the end is near big spaceship okay and uh i laugh every time i wear this
[3:21:46.660 --> 3:21:52.340]  so let me lay out the case every week right now and for the last say three or four years there has
[3:21:52.340 --> 3:21:58.180]  been a steady barrage of strange stories coming out where the government completely flipped its case
[3:21:58.180 --> 3:22:03.620]  and now instead of hiding it they are going to tell you the truth i love it when government tells
[3:22:03.620 --> 3:22:10.340]  me the truth i feel so warm and fuzzy all over said no one with a brain anyway so they're telling
[3:22:10.340 --> 3:22:16.020]  us the truth right now and they're telling us that of course they are very very real um and
[3:22:16.020 --> 3:22:22.820]  they're leaking it out i love government leaks okay and so let's let's bring up a couple of
[3:22:22.820 --> 3:22:30.820]  things and so i started i started looking at some research and i went back into the solid articles
[3:22:30.820 --> 3:22:39.460]  and and recognition of things in the sky and before the 1940s we only had 13 situations
[3:22:39.460 --> 3:22:45.700]  where somebody saw something in the sky it was never little green men because one thing you
[3:22:45.700 --> 3:22:52.820]  need to ask yourself is what is the motivation why did they wait until the 1940s to come and
[3:22:52.820 --> 3:23:00.660]  probe us everybody needs a good anal probing so that's basically all they do anyway so why did
[3:23:00.660 --> 3:23:05.700]  they wait till the 1940s why weren't they coming down all the time why isn't there more record of
[3:23:05.700 --> 3:23:12.660]  that that's the question people should be asking right why did they wait and so i went back into
[3:23:12.660 --> 3:23:22.420]  history there were 13 different examples before 1897 going centuries back of any recording whatsoever
[3:23:22.420 --> 3:23:27.460]  but the problem is is that it looks more like a comet in the sky when they're describing it
[3:23:27.460 --> 3:23:34.340]  they're not describing little green men so keep that in mind okay so really no little green men
[3:23:34.340 --> 3:23:48.340]  sightings until about the 1940s from 1917 to 1940 nothing zero okay since 1940 176 reports on alien
[3:23:48.340 --> 3:23:54.660]  encounters wow they got busy after 1940 and that's right about the time we constructed the UN for
[3:23:54.660 --> 3:24:01.060]  global domination wasn't it in the 40s if i recall interesting that's when pharma came into being too
[3:24:01.060 --> 3:24:05.700]  so remember that too okay they really i mean they were into they were they came into being
[3:24:05.700 --> 3:24:11.300]  in the late 1800s but they really staked their claim after all of the experimentations going on
[3:24:11.300 --> 3:24:20.580]  on the jews over in um nazi germany okay so then we had 56 encounters from 1940 to just 1960 in a
[3:24:20.580 --> 3:24:24.820]  20-year span that's a lot boy they they kicked up their heels they got real busy the little green
[3:24:24.820 --> 3:24:32.500]  men then 176 alien encounters since that inception and that was uh since the league of nations okay
[3:24:32.500 --> 3:24:40.660]  became the UN right and of course um you have a series of events that look like a comet then
[3:24:40.660 --> 3:24:45.620]  we get to the 1940s and this is really interesting i mentioned nazi germany because i go back to
[3:24:45.620 --> 3:24:52.980]  warner von braun which again goes right back to my t-shirt okay the end is near big spaceship okay
[3:24:52.980 --> 3:25:00.660]  and he said to carole rosen his um here he is a nazi scientist okay and then we put him as the
[3:25:00.660 --> 3:25:07.140]  head of not the head of nasa on his deathbed for no apparent reason with no motivation whatsoever
[3:25:07.940 --> 3:25:14.980]  he said carol to his assistant which she has been proclaiming ever since the 70s there is a lie
[3:25:14.980 --> 3:25:21.380]  being told to everybody and you have to stop the weaponization of space and he said the weaponization
[3:25:21.380 --> 3:25:26.740]  of space is not coming from the russians okay that was a lie at the time that we were being told
[3:25:26.740 --> 3:25:33.220]  he said this and he says and then there would be terrorism okay boy we've had a lot of that right
[3:25:33.220 --> 3:25:39.220]  isis with matching outfits and Toyota trucks well funded anyway then there would be asteroids
[3:25:39.940 --> 3:25:42.820]  and how many times in the news in the last few years have you been hearing that
[3:25:42.820 --> 3:25:48.340]  an asteroid's coming an asteroid's probably gonna hit earth planet x whatever the case may be
[3:25:49.460 --> 3:25:55.620]  and the last card they would play would be the extra terrestrial threat
[3:25:56.740 --> 3:26:02.580]  but it was going to be a threat and they were going to play it out so i guess now we can see why
[3:26:02.580 --> 3:26:07.860]  for so many years it made it look like they were hiding something when really they were just playing
[3:26:07.860 --> 3:26:13.460]  around with greater technology than one can fathom i think in this day and age but then all of a
[3:26:13.460 --> 3:26:17.860]  sudden they start what leaking out the stories but think about the motivation for that what was
[3:26:17.860 --> 3:26:25.380]  the motivation to leak out stories why all the sudden start to give people what they want oh
[3:26:25.380 --> 3:26:31.380]  they're finally going to talk about aliens why is that nobody ever asks about motivation but isn't
[3:26:31.380 --> 3:26:38.180]  it the biggest question he told his assistant and here he is Nazi war criminal that we made
[3:26:38.180 --> 3:26:42.820]  head of nasa there was no motivation at all for him to say these things on his deathbed
[3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:49.140]  he said we have to have some reason to spend millions of dollars and that is due to satellites
[3:26:50.020 --> 3:26:54.820]  the issue though is is that nasa's always been a black hole and i think for money laundering
[3:26:54.820 --> 3:27:01.540]  just like cigarettes money laundering through cigarettes through different countries was
[3:27:01.540 --> 3:27:07.460]  the same kind of scapegoat for drugs right they use cigarettes for a long time and and so i look
[3:27:07.460 --> 3:27:12.820]  at this whole scenario being played out and i try to step back a little bit gee aliens never
[3:27:12.820 --> 3:27:18.900]  wanted to come and probe us seems to be the only thing they do am i right good anal probing i mean
[3:27:18.900 --> 3:27:25.780]  honestly think about it any accounts which really this was all after mk ultra so could be accounts
[3:27:25.780 --> 3:27:31.140]  of people on some serious drugs um but all the accounts are they pulled me into an aircraft
[3:27:31.140 --> 3:27:37.060]  and they probed me and then they let me go that's a whole lot of probing for a lot of decades why
[3:27:37.060 --> 3:27:42.260]  what's the point what are they doing right and so i always thought it was kind of funny because no
[3:27:42.260 --> 3:27:47.540]  one could ever answer that question it was like they probed us well why what would be the reason
[3:27:47.540 --> 3:27:54.260]  for that so before 1940s you really didn't have much going on but you did have a meeting
[3:27:55.460 --> 3:28:02.820]  post league of nations where john dewey from the good old dewey decimal system was meeting actually
[3:28:02.820 --> 3:28:10.340]  with japan they were meeting with japan this is 1917 actually and he was at the time with
[3:28:10.340 --> 3:28:14.900]  columbia university and here is the express written record to think that is one of our
[3:28:14.900 --> 3:28:18.660]  greatest desires of the american people and this is one of the great desires that new york
[3:28:18.660 --> 3:28:23.860]  expresses to you this is 1917 to the conclusion of your happy visit with us john dewey professor
[3:28:23.860 --> 3:28:27.860]  of philosophy at columbia university who was the next speaker was listened to with great
[3:28:27.860 --> 3:28:33.780]  intentness he said someone remarked in the best way to unite all the nations on this globe would be
[3:28:33.780 --> 3:28:42.260]  an attack from some other planet interesting john dewey says that and then all of a sudden
[3:28:42.260 --> 3:28:50.340]  we start to get all of these interesting visitations that no one can really examine
[3:28:51.060 --> 3:28:55.780]  i'll be right back i'm k dally your guest host on the alex jones show i have so much more
[3:28:56.180 --> 3:29:00.980]  the nation assumes his new film 2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times
[3:29:00.980 --> 3:29:05.780]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to steal
[3:29:05.780 --> 3:29:10.580]  future elections and complete our journey to basically being like venezuela now it's great
[3:29:10.580 --> 3:29:15.540]  that it's online it's great that millions watch online but you need to have the high quality hd

[3:33:11.140 --> 3:33:16.020]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm kate dally your guest host so glad to be here with you
[3:33:16.020 --> 3:33:20.740]  and some so glad to share these things with you part of the research i've done over the years
[3:33:20.740 --> 3:33:26.180]  and i think it's important research to take in even if you still believe that aliens are coming
[3:33:26.180 --> 3:33:31.540]  to get us at least you'll have this as background and context too that's how that's what i figure
[3:33:31.540 --> 3:33:38.660]  anyway i'm always open trust me i'm always open to things um but on this one i think that we are
[3:33:38.660 --> 3:33:44.580]  well played i really do um and i think this was a way actually to make us look a little nutty
[3:33:44.580 --> 3:33:49.940]  tell you the truth um but here we go because i know a lot of people disagree with me it's
[3:33:49.940 --> 3:33:56.660]  fine um it's all like i haven't had that happen before so john dewey of the dewey decimal system
[3:33:56.660 --> 3:34:01.140]  although john dewey wasn't the dewey decimal system when this was happening um was at the
[3:34:01.140 --> 3:34:08.500]  meeting where japan came this was prior to world war two and obviously um this was uh prior to
[3:34:08.500 --> 3:34:16.660]  league of nations this was in 1917 he said at this world meeting that uh he said he was listened to
[3:34:16.660 --> 3:34:22.020]  it was uh john dewey professor of philosophy in columbia university who was the next speaker at
[3:34:22.020 --> 3:34:28.340]  this event was listened to with great intentness and he said someone remarked that the best way to
[3:34:28.340 --> 3:34:34.740]  unite all the nations on this globe would be an attack from some other planet maybe werner von
[3:34:34.740 --> 3:34:41.700]  braun the nazi criminal but then became head of nasa was right maybe they were actually going to use
[3:34:42.420 --> 3:34:50.500]  an alien hoax to say to to to bring us together think about this the movies um you go to the
[3:34:50.500 --> 3:34:56.260]  movies and what do you usually witness usually witness a group of people all dressed in gray in
[3:34:56.260 --> 3:35:01.220]  the future why is it always gray that's what i want to know anyway um are we colorblind what's
[3:35:01.220 --> 3:35:06.980]  going on anyway so it's always a group dressed in gray and they are the world government right and
[3:35:06.980 --> 3:35:13.460]  they solve the problem of what's been going on america out the door sovereignty of any nation
[3:35:13.460 --> 3:35:18.580]  out the door because we all must come together for this huge threat that's coming our way it's
[3:35:18.580 --> 3:35:23.700]  a great way to install the new world order in other words and i think they're actually have
[3:35:23.700 --> 3:35:28.020]  been really successful about it because all you have to do is look like well we're hiding it
[3:35:28.020 --> 3:35:33.140]  since the 1940s and we're not going to let anybody know but really what we're doing is working on
[3:35:33.140 --> 3:35:39.220]  technology and um and we probably would be pretty surprised to see where our tax dollars have gone
[3:35:39.220 --> 3:35:45.940]  in darpa and all of these other agencies that freely use our money um and so we have constructed
[3:35:45.940 --> 3:35:51.940]  things that even might possibly look like alien ships you never know the technology when people
[3:35:51.940 --> 3:35:57.380]  are looking at technology it's kind of like how would somebody in the year 1600 look at a cell
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:36:02.900]  phone and try to describe it so if we're describing something in the sky how do you know that we didn't
[3:36:02.900 --> 3:36:10.260]  construct it with DARPA money because we really are not allowed on to those those places uh area
[3:36:10.260 --> 3:36:18.260]  51 and so forth and they sure are secretive so there was only one account in 1897 and and actually
[3:36:18.260 --> 3:36:24.660]  the newspaper said it was a tall tale it was in texas by the way and uh they they now say it was
[3:36:24.660 --> 3:36:31.700]  a fictional UFO story but that didn't really kick it off it was really the 1940s and the 1950s
[3:36:32.500 --> 3:36:40.580]  surprisingly what also came along at this time oh yeah the CIA love the CIA um big heart emoji for
[3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:47.620]  the CIA anyway can anyone actually tell me anything they've done that's good um so an
[3:36:47.620 --> 3:36:55.940]  extraordinary this is what they wrote as far as their role in 1947 to 1990 okay 1947 remember those
[3:36:55.940 --> 3:37:01.540]  40s um an extraordinary 95 percent of all Americans have at least heard or read something
[3:37:01.540 --> 3:37:07.060]  about a UFO unidentified flying object wasn't that convenient i think it was because the press
[3:37:07.060 --> 3:37:12.500]  kept talking about it 57 percent believe they are real ah but they were going to try to do a
[3:37:12.500 --> 3:37:18.820]  better job than that right so former u.s presidents carter and reagan have claimed to even seen a UFO
[3:37:19.620 --> 3:37:24.900]  and uh and that you at private UFO organizations are found throughout the united states and many
[3:37:24.900 --> 3:37:31.460]  are convinced that the u.s government particularly cia are engaged in a massive conspiracy this was
[3:37:31.460 --> 3:37:37.780]  written about the cia role are engaged in a massive conspiracy and cover up the issue the idea that the
[3:37:37.780 --> 3:37:45.140]  cia has secretly concealed research into UFOs has been a major theme of UFO um buff since the modern
[3:37:45.140 --> 3:37:52.820]  UFO phenomena emerged in the late 1940s coincidentally right about the time of the cia isn't it kind
[3:37:52.820 --> 3:37:58.980]  of amazing that we had the cia to keep the information secret right when it came out
[3:37:58.980 --> 3:38:07.940]  if i was a coincidence theorist i'd be like yep total coincidence there but i'm not so um
[3:38:08.580 --> 3:38:15.300]  in the late 1993 after being pressured by ufo oligists after the release of additional cia
[3:38:15.300 --> 3:38:22.660]  information on ufo's james wolsey what a gem um ordered the review of all agency files on ufo's
[3:38:22.660 --> 3:38:28.740]  and using cia records compiled from that review of course the cia has all the records of course they
[3:38:28.740 --> 3:38:37.780]  do uh this study traces cia interests super interested and involvement very very involved
[3:38:37.780 --> 3:38:43.380]  in the ufo controversy from the late 1940s to 1990 and they said it chronologically
[3:38:43.380 --> 3:38:48.900]  examines the agency's efforts to solve the mystery of ufo's they're going to solve their
[3:38:48.900 --> 3:38:55.220]  own creation interesting so its programs had an impact on the ufo sightings and its attempts to conceal
[3:38:55.220 --> 3:39:00.900]  cia involvement in the entire ufo issue just make something look like it's concealed to
[3:39:00.900 --> 3:39:07.700]  make people want it more what emerges from this examination is that while agency concern over
[3:39:07.700 --> 3:39:16.980]  ufo's was substantial until the early 1950s cia has paid only limited and peripheral attention
[3:39:16.980 --> 3:39:22.660]  to the phenomena oh i think they've done more than that and so that background is really
[3:39:22.660 --> 3:39:28.020]  interesting isn't it because the first report of a flying saucer over the united states came on
[3:39:28.020 --> 3:39:35.460]  june 24th see that's in a couple of days anniversary 1947 when kenneth arnold a private pilot
[3:39:35.460 --> 3:39:41.700]  reputable businessman while looking for a downed plane cited nine disc shaped objects near mount
[3:39:41.700 --> 3:39:48.180]  rey near washington traveling at an estimated speed of over 1 000 miles if he really did see
[3:39:48.180 --> 3:39:53.540]  this my guess would be that we've been very very busy in the technology department with things
[3:39:53.540 --> 3:39:59.220]  that we didn't know we could create you know the nazis were really far ahead in some technologies
[3:39:59.220 --> 3:40:04.820]  and very interesting that nobody ever asked that question why did we create these things
[3:40:04.820 --> 3:40:11.540]  how do you know they're from outer space i always feel like we are uh we're made in god's image
[3:40:11.540 --> 3:40:17.060]  i really don't think we'd have anybody competing that's three foot two and green but with that
[3:40:17.060 --> 3:40:23.380]  being said um i think that this has been a tremendous hoax laid out on us and i think
[3:40:23.380 --> 3:40:28.820]  we've all been pretty played so arnold's report was followed by a flood of additional
[3:40:28.820 --> 3:40:34.980]  sightings imagine that um just a flood including reports from military and civilian pilots when
[3:40:34.980 --> 3:40:40.660]  did the cia really get established oh yeah that's right it was the oss and then it became
[3:40:40.660 --> 3:40:48.580]  yep 1947 1948 right about that time what a coincidence for the coincidence theorists so
[3:40:50.100 --> 3:40:59.380]  basically a huge amount of new sightings came into effect and in 1948 the air force
[3:40:59.380 --> 3:41:05.380]  head of the air Nathan twining head of the air force service command established project sign
[3:41:05.380 --> 3:41:12.500]  it's always a project initially named project saucer i guess i was too obvious um to collect
[3:41:12.500 --> 3:41:18.660]  and evaluate and distribute right within the government all information related to such
[3:41:18.660 --> 3:41:24.260]  sightings on the premise that ufo's might be real of national security concern
[3:41:26.020 --> 3:41:32.180]  and now all of a sudden for exactly no motivation at all they seem to want you to know that they're
[3:41:32.180 --> 3:41:38.420]  real by releasing the information have they ever said why have they ever said what the motivation
[3:41:38.420 --> 3:41:45.220]  is in suddenly doing a complete 180 and saying oh yep now it now it exists after we tried to say
[3:41:45.220 --> 3:41:50.420]  it didn't exist for decades and now it all all the sudden does is that because they're getting ready
[3:41:50.980 --> 3:41:58.500]  to play this in the biggest way possible could be and isn't that kind of scary this all came along
[3:41:58.500 --> 3:42:04.100]  right after the advent of the cia and then the cia holds all the information i find that kind of
[3:42:04.100 --> 3:42:12.180]  interesting not the states the cia by the way they got a lot more feds on the payroll and
[3:42:12.180 --> 3:42:17.300]  they're really trying to go grow federal police that's a whole different show but that was one
[3:42:17.300 --> 3:42:23.460]  of the reasonings behind uvaldi was that they would make the local police look totally inept again
[3:42:23.460 --> 3:42:31.300]  just like they did in florida broward county and then introduce more federal federal fbi agents to
[3:42:31.300 --> 3:42:37.460]  cover where the ineptness of the local cop you know this is why swat became really a police force
[3:42:37.460 --> 3:42:44.020]  at every turn cat stuck in a tree go get swat that's why and so the cia being very federalized
[3:42:44.020 --> 3:42:49.860]  along with the feds everything's going to central right we know this central control is really one
[3:42:49.860 --> 3:42:55.220]  of their biggest weapons against us and they're doing it marvelously you're right back i'm k dally
[3:42:55.220 --> 3:43:01.380]  your guest home the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alec shones was right
[3:43:01.380 --> 3:43:06.420]  people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick feeling because i knew this
[3:43:06.420 --> 3:43:13.060]  was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going to become more important
[3:43:13.060 --> 3:43:20.100]  than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents it's now
[3:43:20.100 --> 3:43:26.100]  out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the bilderberg group founded
[3:43:26.100 --> 3:43:32.420]  davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move because they know
[3:43:32.420 --> 3:43:36.740]  they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching the children counting on us
[3:43:36.740 --> 3:43:40.420]  i just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your
[3:43:40.420 --> 3:43:45.300]  financial support because without you info wars would not be here it's only to really internalize

[3:46:07.540 --> 3:46:12.020]  it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than that and that's an example of what
[3:46:12.020 --> 3:46:18.340]  i'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there

[3:46:27.380 --> 3:46:31.380]  a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five capillates of krill oil
[3:46:31.380 --> 3:46:39.300]  before i go to bed i'm seeing Santa Claus that night so your brain is made basically out of
[3:46:39.300 --> 3:46:46.340]  what fish oil is so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsessed because
[3:46:46.340 --> 3:46:51.140]  whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it in four store
[3:46:57.540 --> 3:47:03.540]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:10.740 --> 3:47:14.980]  back here with you on the alex jones show so happy to be here thanks again alex and i'm kate
[3:47:14.980 --> 3:47:20.980]  dally your guesthouse from kate dally radio dot com i do a daily show and let me just let me just
[3:47:20.980 --> 3:47:26.180]  tell you going back to warner von braun nazi criminal but then became head of nasa i like
[3:47:26.180 --> 3:47:30.260]  how we like to put the criminals at the head of everything kind of interesting it was also a
[3:47:30.260 --> 3:47:36.500]  nazi scientist that came up with the um just a theory on climate change that al gore seemed to
[3:47:36.500 --> 3:47:43.380]  want to ride in um to be able to become um a member of our government um but it's it's always
[3:47:43.380 --> 3:47:50.020]  interesting to me these nazi germ these nazi um criminals war criminals that we that we really
[3:47:50.020 --> 3:47:56.980]  sort of liked um anyway so remember what he said on his deathbed with no motivation whatsoever to
[3:47:56.980 --> 3:48:01.940]  say this okay and i always look for motivation i think that's a really big tale uh but really
[3:48:01.940 --> 3:48:07.460]  big tell on what somebody's what what somebody's saying and why so they said uh the weaponization
[3:48:07.460 --> 3:48:13.620]  of space you got to stop that um the the nasa was a black hole for a lot of money laundering and that
[3:48:14.260 --> 3:48:18.980]  he didn't really exactly say that that comes from other research i've done but he did say that that
[3:48:18.980 --> 3:48:23.940]  they had to have a reason to spend millions and millions of dollars up there um but that also
[3:48:23.940 --> 3:48:29.540]  that uh that we would be told these lies that the weaponization of space is coming from the russians
[3:48:30.660 --> 3:48:35.780]  i don't think it was and he said it wasn't um that there would be terrorism threats and once
[3:48:35.780 --> 3:48:42.580]  that didn't work anymore then there would be the threat of the asteroid and then after asteroids
[3:48:42.580 --> 3:48:47.860]  didn't work they would then the last card they would ever play hence the t-shirt the end is near
[3:48:47.860 --> 3:48:53.220]  with the spaceship we have to have some reason or the last card be the extraterrestrial threat
[3:48:55.140 --> 3:49:00.100]  so if they bring that in and we're threatened with this and boy have we been have we've been
[3:49:00.100 --> 3:49:05.940]  manipulated with a lot of movies right and a lot of text um context to be able to go oh yeah we
[3:49:05.940 --> 3:49:10.820]  can totally see this coming because really and truly um they have shown us movies about this
[3:49:10.820 --> 3:49:16.660]  for decades i think to really sort of open us up to the idea that's how it works right disney's
[3:49:16.660 --> 3:49:23.380]  there to groom children and the rest of them are there to groom us as far as uh this is this is
[3:49:23.380 --> 3:49:29.460]  where we're going with the world and isn't it great said no one ever so what is project bluebeam
[3:49:29.460 --> 3:49:33.220]  and i do want to talk about this for a moment because i think this is very interesting um according
[3:49:33.220 --> 3:49:40.580]  to sir jamin ost who died suddenly at the age of 49 who i'd love to interview but can't um just
[3:49:40.580 --> 3:49:46.260]  suddenly the uh four step project was designed by nasa and united nations and it would allow these
[3:49:46.260 --> 3:49:53.380]  organizations to accomplish what he believed their ultimate goal was in creating a new age religion
[3:49:53.380 --> 3:49:59.860]  right um led by the antichrist and in order to start the work the new world order dictatorship
[3:49:59.860 --> 3:50:05.540]  so nasa would implement project bluebeam with a system of advanced mind control as well as
[3:50:05.540 --> 3:50:11.140]  top secret technology in order to trick everyone into believing there had been a second coming of
[3:50:11.140 --> 3:50:17.860]  sorts kind of interesting now think about this at the advent of the cia and mk ultra and all the
[3:50:17.860 --> 3:50:24.660]  experimentation with all the drugs that they were doing right isn't it interesting that they talk
[3:50:24.660 --> 3:50:29.700]  about advanced mind control what is the cia been working on since the very beginning and the the
[3:50:29.700 --> 3:50:34.180]  inception of the cia now didn't the cia tell us they were there to catch the bad foreign guy
[3:50:35.140 --> 3:50:40.500]  well why is it then that really the bulk of what they were doing then was all about manipulating
[3:50:40.500 --> 3:50:45.940]  us and how they were doing it and how they could do it in the future and so it is interesting that
[3:50:45.940 --> 3:50:52.180]  this whole project is about top secret technology as far as advanced mind control so the first step
[3:50:52.180 --> 3:50:59.380]  would be involving the manufacturing artificially created earthquakes right and then um uh you would
[3:50:59.380 --> 3:51:04.340]  have the second step and that would involve a gigantic space show and during the stage of
[3:51:04.340 --> 3:51:10.660]  project bluebeam the three-dimensional optical hologram as well as laser projections to hologram
[3:51:10.660 --> 3:51:17.140]  images would beam across the sky and what would these images include probably a lot of maybe
[3:51:17.140 --> 3:51:23.700]  buddha uh muhammad jesus like different pictures right would merge into one and then he explained
[3:51:23.700 --> 3:51:27.860]  that the technology behind this display saying that the conspirators would use space-based
[3:51:27.860 --> 3:51:33.940]  laser laser generating satellites to project simultaneous images to the four corners of this
[3:51:33.940 --> 3:51:39.140]  planet in every language and dialect according to the region and the whole sky would be transformed
[3:51:39.140 --> 3:51:44.340]  into a massive movie screen and people would believe their eyes because their eyes would be
[3:51:44.340 --> 3:51:49.700]  seeing something that they think is real the third step is where the mind control takes
[3:51:49.700 --> 3:51:55.940]  center stage now think about this and think about the shots that they're so desperate a series of
[3:51:55.940 --> 3:52:01.940]  shots not just a shot a series of shots what in the hell are they building in our bodies okay there's
[3:52:01.940 --> 3:52:06.900]  a reason that according to the sniffles you're supposed to run down in fear and get this shot
[3:52:06.900 --> 3:52:12.100]  even the only one percent of our nation even has a problem with their immune immunity that would
[3:52:12.660 --> 3:52:18.420]  even look at this thing they're trying to get it in everybody's arms why well the third step
[3:52:18.420 --> 3:52:24.340]  was mind control telephonic communication devices that would send waves to reach each person within
[3:52:24.340 --> 3:52:31.620]  their own minds how could you do that unless you put something in everybody's body that would enable
[3:52:31.620 --> 3:52:39.140]  them to do that what is the whole cia goal been for years and years and years mind control why study
[3:52:39.140 --> 3:52:46.820]  mind control so intently why if we if we weren't being assaulted left and right as a country if
[3:52:46.820 --> 3:52:51.780]  people weren't really out to get us at every single turn because i do think we were told that for
[3:52:51.780 --> 3:52:56.660]  years and years and years to get us to be put in fear um and not even question the fact that we
[3:52:56.660 --> 3:53:03.540]  hadn't actually been attacked okay but just in fear the cia reaches out to only work on mind control
[3:53:04.580 --> 3:53:12.420]  hmm strange so then um this third step so convincing them that their own god is speaking
[3:53:12.420 --> 3:53:18.100]  to them through the very depths of their soul interesting and so how would these rays be able
[3:53:18.100 --> 3:53:23.780]  to reach each person's inner mind in order to tell them something because look at look at it this way
[3:53:23.780 --> 3:53:29.460]  everybody with covid thought everyone was dying everywhere else just not in front of them so we
[3:53:29.460 --> 3:53:34.020]  weren't even seeing anything and people still refer to it as the pandemic and the plague okay
[3:53:35.140 --> 3:53:40.100]  so then what happens when people see something with their own eyes and they're sure they saw it
[3:53:40.100 --> 3:53:43.780]  even though they're not quite really sure of what they saw they're sure they saw it
[3:53:45.300 --> 3:53:50.100]  i think it'd be much harder to get people to really examine the way they believe in the things
[3:53:50.100 --> 3:53:55.220]  that they're seeing right because we tend to believe what we see that could be a very big
[3:53:55.220 --> 3:54:00.740]  problem for us later on and they said that hey these these such rays from satellites are fed into
[3:54:00.740 --> 3:54:05.860]  the memories of computers that have stored massive data on every human on earth think about all the
[3:54:05.860 --> 3:54:11.300]  dna testing think about all of the computers that have led to control over us and they know
[3:54:11.300 --> 3:54:16.180]  everything about us look at facebook okay the rays then interface with natural thinking to form
[3:54:16.180 --> 3:54:21.540]  what we call what we call diffuse artificial thought and for finally the fourth step would be
[3:54:21.540 --> 3:54:26.740]  to make use of all these various technologies in order to convince people that alien invasions
[3:54:26.740 --> 3:54:32.900]  and the rapture itself was taking place and making it easier for the powers that be that take control
[3:54:32.900 --> 3:54:39.700]  to a very fear laden populace and so this is kind of interesting isn't it so if you're asking
[3:54:39.700 --> 3:54:47.860]  yourself i know but can they really do that well this phenomena first demonstrated as an experiment
[3:54:47.860 --> 3:54:54.900]  1973 at walter reed army institute of research by dr joseph sharp who personally underwent tests
[3:54:54.900 --> 3:54:59.780]  in which he proved he could hear and understand spoken words delivered to him in an echo free
[3:54:59.780 --> 3:55:06.500]  isolation chamber via a pulse microwave audiogram and analog of the word sound vibration beamed
[3:55:06.500 --> 3:55:11.700]  into his brain and then they went on to state that such a device has obvious application and
[3:55:11.700 --> 3:55:19.540]  covert operation designed to drive a target crazy with a voice or deliver undetectable instruction
[3:55:19.540 --> 3:55:24.260]  to a programmed asset you know we see that all the time right did you know we never really saw
[3:55:24.260 --> 3:55:30.260]  that until the cia got involved and then we didn't really see that until really the 1960s the lone
[3:55:30.260 --> 3:55:37.860]  gun assassin anyway so this was clear back in 73 that they were playing with this technology
[3:55:37.860 --> 3:55:43.940]  there was a book in 1978 entitled microwave auditory effect in application by jamesy limb
[3:55:43.940 --> 3:55:49.300]  and it explained how audible voice can be broadcast directly into the brain the technology could be
[3:55:49.300 --> 3:55:55.300]  used to make the deaf hear but instead it has been turned against the public very interesting they
[3:55:55.300 --> 3:56:01.940]  of course studied frogs hearts by synchronizing the pulse rate they did all kinds of different
[3:56:01.940 --> 3:56:10.260]  studies all high-frequency studies too and then they were all studied at length by the cia in 1977
[3:56:10.260 --> 3:56:16.420]  in testimony before the senate subcommittee on health and scientific research and dr gotlieb
[3:56:16.420 --> 3:56:22.660]  that jim um who directed the mk ultra painless program at that time was forced to discuss aspects
[3:56:22.660 --> 3:56:29.780]  of the cia research to find technique to all of this the human organs by remote electronic means
[3:56:30.660 --> 3:56:35.140]  you know when the first shots first came out i remembered this and i remembered studying this
[3:56:35.140 --> 3:56:40.980]  and i remember thinking how else could they get people to hear things or get them to believe
[3:56:40.980 --> 3:56:46.580]  something if they didn't have control from the inside and we all know that doctors have said in
[3:56:46.580 --> 3:56:52.340]  the future you won't even have to step inside a hospital honey we'll be able to just hear you
[3:56:52.340 --> 3:56:56.980]  from where we are because we'll have access to the inside of your body how do you think that
[3:56:56.980 --> 3:57:02.500]  happens unless we're putting an operating system inside our body how would you get an operating
[3:57:02.500 --> 3:57:07.940]  system inside somebody's body tell them they're in fear of dying from the sniffles and they'll
[3:57:07.940 --> 3:57:16.500]  believe you honestly and so is that where we're going is that really what is going to happen to
[3:57:16.500 --> 3:57:21.140]  us with all of those shots one must wonder why they're so desperate you always have to ask for
[3:57:21.140 --> 3:57:27.060]  motivation don't you why are they so desperate to get that jab into every living soul and believe
[3:57:27.060 --> 3:57:32.500]  me they are we're going to get more stuff dropped on us they really want a series of shots injected
[3:57:32.500 --> 3:57:38.020]  into every human on earth including infants there's a reason for that they also hate people
[3:57:38.900 --> 3:57:43.780]  population control that's finest i'm k dally your guest host for alex jones it's been fun
