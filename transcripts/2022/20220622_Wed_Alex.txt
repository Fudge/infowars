[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.590]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.930]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.030]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:05.431]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:06.231]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:06.952]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.252 --> 00:00:08.192]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:11.433]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:13.814]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.055]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:16.175]  today.
[00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:30.054]   The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines for children
[00:00:30.054 --> 00:00:33.775]  as young as six months old.
[00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:38.317]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[00:00:38.757 --> 00:00:43.218]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:52.642]  We now know, based on rigorous scientific review, that the vaccines available here in the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[00:00:53.422 --> 00:01:00.626]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:05.269]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:19.097]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:29.606]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors of mRNA technology.
[00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:35.828]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths.
[00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:43.951]  And yet, we are still being lied to by our own government, who wants us to sacrifice our youngest children.
[00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.032]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha, and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[00:01:48.192 --> 00:01:49.773]  I have some really exciting news.
[00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:55.215]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under five.
[00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:57.435]  These vaccines are incredibly safe.
[00:01:57.916 --> 00:02:00.316]  They work to prevent serious illness.
[00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:09.559]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated, and now if you're a parent of a kid under five, this is a great time to go out and get your child protected.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.840]  Get them vaccinated.
[00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:20.402]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which we know is a lie.
[00:02:21.602 --> 00:02:28.644]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other vaccine in history.
[00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:36.247]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death.
[00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:47.363]  There is a well-documented risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys, and severe blood clotting in young women.
[00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:54.029]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[00:02:56.591 --> 00:03:06.139]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[00:03:08.044 --> 00:03:23.751]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:30.214]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:42.433]  The UK reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the US is seeing a 20% increase in deaths and a 10% increase in disability.
[00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:53.698]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.441]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:04.676]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:11.676]  Thanks for watching.
[00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:15.015]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:17.595]  (upbeat music)
[00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:26.121]  [MUSIC]
[00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:30.361]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.201]   Joe Biden, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all the usual suspects,
[00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.121]   are telling us that a new pandemic and lockdowns are imminent.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.321]  As the world plunges into financial crisis via hyperinflation.
[00:04:49.502 --> 00:04:54.584]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen to this live Wednesday, June 22nd worldwide broadcast.
[00:04:55.104 --> 00:04:59.385]  I'm your host Alex Jones, very pleased and honored to be back in this chair.
[00:04:59.505 --> 00:05:03.566]  Want to say great job to the crew, Owen Schroyer, and of course others.
[00:05:03.706 --> 00:05:23.014]   While I have been out of town, I've been back for days dealing with just the finances to keep this operation on air because all Small companies, and we're not a business to be a business, but we're a business to fund ourselves, using capitalism to exercise the First Amendment and freedom, are under absolute attack.
[00:05:23.074 --> 00:05:25.756]  Not just this operation, but the entire country.
[00:05:25.776 --> 00:05:29.218]  We have a lot of very important news on that front and the next.
[00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.370]   leg of the great reset that our enemies have planned for us and how to stop that and so
[00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.450]  much more today.
[00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.850]   But as I sit here looking at all this incredible news, I ask myself, what is the most important
[00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.091]  news item out there?
[00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:49.471]   Well, there's all the symptoms of the disease that is the new world order and globalism.
[00:05:49.471 --> 00:05:51.930]  And so the big question is, how do we tackle globalism?
[00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:53.876]  How do we expose globalism?
[00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:59.298]  How do we dismantle and prosecute globalism, the greatest tyranny humans have ever seen?
[00:05:59.918 --> 00:06:13.483]  And then separately, how do we recognize the fruits of globalism to wake up our friends, family, neighbors, and strangers so they understand why their lives are getting very bad, why crime is increasing, why they're going bankrupt?
[00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:22.688]  We're going to be discussing it all here today, and I intend at the bottom of the hour to give the number out and take calls today.
[00:06:22.788 --> 00:06:34.254]  But I'm going to be very specific, and we're going to screen your calls today and ask that you call in on the specific subject that I'm about to lay out, which is, how do we defeat the Globalist?
[00:06:35.054 --> 00:06:36.835]  That's a huge, giant subject.
[00:06:36.855 --> 00:06:38.917]  We can go a thousand different directions with.
[00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:40.818]  How do we defeat the New World Order?
[00:06:41.843 --> 00:06:45.226]  And then, currently, what is the worst thing they're doing?
[00:06:45.286 --> 00:06:47.889]  What is the number one thing they're doing that we need to stop?
[00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.831]  Devaluing the currencies?
[00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:52.393]  Defunding the police?
[00:06:52.994 --> 00:06:54.696]  Dissolving the borders?
[00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:56.698]  Coming after our guns?
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.921]  Launching war with Russia?
[00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.687]  Preparing to release new bioweapons?
[00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:10.785]  But you know, they're not really preparing to release new bioweapons.
[00:07:10.825 --> 00:07:12.746]  They are releasing new bioweapons.
[00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:18.489]  Or targeting a new group of people with their bio-nanotech weapon.
[00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:20.129]  And that is babies.
[00:07:23.431 --> 00:07:27.032]  Six months old and up.
[00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:32.575]  The corrupt FDA had three different rounds of resignations.
[00:07:33.973 --> 00:07:39.093]   firings off their board the last year and a half because the board would not even authorize
[00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:45.732]   authorizing these experimental injections for anybody So they had one board resign or large portions of it
[00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:50.812]   Then they got new people on and said now we're gonna go down to age 16 and a bunch of them said no now
[00:07:50.812 --> 00:07:59.372]   We're gonna add boosters and shots every few months. No And now they had more board members resign
[00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:06.771]   And they've got a board now that unanimously voted to lie to the public and say that this works great
[00:08:06.771 --> 00:08:19.692]   That it's a vaccine and that it totally protects you [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:21.423]  When it isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system, causes all sorts of serious problems, and... doesn't protect you.
[00:08:23.284 --> 00:08:25.165]  Absolute organized evil.
[00:08:26.386 --> 00:08:29.848]  Depopulation against the people of this planet.
[00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.310]  Outrageous.
[00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.872]  You know, some stations don't carry the first little five-minute segment we do every day, but a lot of them do.
[00:08:37.693 --> 00:08:42.215]  But I'm going to be re-airing, coming up later in the hour, a short four-minute report by Greg Reese.
[00:08:43.575 --> 00:08:45.676]  And all of his reports are pivotal and critical.
[00:08:45.716 --> 00:08:46.656]  This one particularly.
[00:08:47.437 --> 00:08:52.699]  Establishment loyalist manipulated into sacrificing their own children.
[00:08:53.479 --> 00:09:24.856]   When I was on a workcation to the West Coast and other areas, I talked to many nurses and doctors in the airport and on the street who told me the same thing we see in the news, the same thing we hear from callers, the same thing we experience in our own lives, about how at the hospital, in one particular case talking to a registered nurse, who's a grandma, been a nurse for more than three decades,
[00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.873]  And she said multiple doctors got sick from the shots.
[00:09:32.748 --> 00:09:47.193]  And one of the main doctors, 12-year-old son, took a shot and had to have heart ablation, something a 7-year-old man would get, cauterizing his heart, because his heart was beating at a resting level of 160 beats per minute and was in danger of a heart attack.
[00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:51.855]  And it was directly from the shot, and he said, no, it's not from the shot, I don't care.
[00:09:52.695 --> 00:10:01.051]   And they have shortages, not just from the people that they ran off that wouldn't take the shot, She was so senior they didn't get rid of her.
[00:10:01.372 --> 00:10:01.992]  She didn't take it.
[00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:03.432]  Her husband works there too.
[00:10:04.893 --> 00:10:08.314]  But they have massive shortages at this one big hospital.
[00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:09.114]  She told me the name of it.
[00:10:09.134 --> 00:10:09.754]  I'm not going to say it.
[00:10:13.835 --> 00:10:16.696]  Because so many of the staff are sick from the injections.
[00:10:16.776 --> 00:10:18.656]  This is massive.
[00:10:20.157 --> 00:10:20.957]  This is huge.
[00:10:21.957 --> 00:10:26.939]  And the question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:32.429]  I mean, how crazy is this going to get before we find sanity?
[00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:42.617]  And thank God, Governor DeSantis came out and said, how dare Biden target babies with this when no babies have died of COVID and little children don't even really get sick from it?
[00:10:43.669 --> 00:10:44.670]  Why are they doing this?
[00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.972]  Because they're targeting them to sterilize them.
[00:10:48.012 --> 00:10:51.415]  We know the shots reduce fertility, sterilize many people.
[00:10:51.995 --> 00:10:58.800]  We know that it annihilates immune systems and will turn these children into invalids if they even survive.
[00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:02.383]  So good for DeSantis.
[00:11:02.403 --> 00:11:11.389]  But here's Biden chillingly saying a new pandemic is coming and he's reading off the same script as Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab and others.
[00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:11.730]  Here it is.
[00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:13.122]  At least this year.
[00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:14.443]  We do need more money.
[00:11:15.003 --> 00:11:18.866]  But we don't just need more money for vaccines for children eventually.
[00:11:19.447 --> 00:11:21.829]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic.
[00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:23.210]  There's going to be another pandemic.
[00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.671]  We have to think ahead.
[00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:27.813]  And that's not something the last outfit did very well.
[00:11:28.094 --> 00:11:29.935]  That's something we've been doing fairly well.
[00:11:30.255 --> 00:11:31.256]  That's why we need the money.
[00:11:32.637 --> 00:11:33.458]  We need the money.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.182]  To create a biomedical tyranny in a world IV system.
[00:11:38.242 --> 00:11:39.683]  It's now all been announced.
[00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:44.459]  And we've got all the other little satanic parrots up there saying the exact same thing.
[00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:53.906]  Because the general public cannot get it through their heads that they are under attack by these monsters.
[00:11:54.467 --> 00:11:56.228]  But that is exactly what's going on.
[00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:00.812]  So as I said, I'm gonna open the phones up, not yet, please don't call yet.
[00:12:01.452 --> 00:12:03.154]  It's a computer system, we gotta flip it on.
[00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:18.905]   But at the bottom of the hour, At 30 after, we're going to flip that computer on, a digital phone system, and we're going to open the phones up for first-time callers to give you a chance in the first round.
[00:12:19.145 --> 00:12:20.286]  After that, everybody can call in.
[00:12:22.393 --> 00:12:27.475]  On how do we defeat the New World Order and what is the most evil thing they're doing right now?
[00:12:27.495 --> 00:12:36.998]  Because we all know it's part of a concerted effort to collapse civilization, but what is the most wicked thing they're doing right now that we can focus on and expose and try to stop the New World Order?
[00:12:39.078 --> 00:12:39.759]  That's the issue.
[00:12:39.799 --> 00:12:42.920]  I'll be giving the number out coming up in about 13-14 minutes.
[00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:46.026]  We'll take a lot of your phone calls today.
[00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:50.629]  Leo Zegami is going to be popping in for the first 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:54.792]  He's the Vatican expert that predicted everything that's happened so far.
[00:12:55.472 --> 00:12:57.113]  He predicted the last pope would resign.
[00:12:57.513 --> 00:12:59.055]  He predicted the next pope would resign.
[00:12:59.535 --> 00:13:00.515]  They don't say that's imminent.
[00:13:00.576 --> 00:13:02.377]  What does that really politically mean?
[00:13:03.117 --> 00:13:04.258]  That's such a political office.
[00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:05.679]  It's a big deal geopolitically.
[00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:11.423]  We'll be discussing that coming up some in the third hour today.
[00:13:11.483 --> 00:13:22.735]   But the first hour and second hour We're going to play a ton of clips, go over a ton of big news stories, and I'm going to give you my breakdown on what I think is coming next and how to stop this nightmare situation.
[00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:33.157]  There's also been a lot of vindication that's happened, and we're going to hit that information on the other side because it shows how right you've been, how right I've been, how right we've been, and where this is all going.
[00:13:33.617 --> 00:13:36.758]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:13:37.318 --> 00:13:39.638]  Band.videos, where the censored videos live.
[00:13:40.058 --> 00:13:41.419]  Band.video.
[00:13:42.439 --> 00:13:43.539]  It's psychology.
[00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:52.356]  And if you're not aware of how the human mind works, you will be absolutely defenseless against the enemies of humanity.
[00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:55.696]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:57.357 --> 00:14:20.716]   The social engineers know that if they do horribly evil things and nobody engages in leadership and opposes them and challenges them, The general public will just buy the official stories and let the very abusers carrying out the attacks pose as the saviors to then get even more power and more control and carry out their goal of depopulation.
[00:14:22.369 --> 00:14:25.730]  And it's scary to admit that these COVID shots aren't vaccines.
[00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.231]  It's scary to admit they're killing us, that all the actuaries and numbers from insurance companies show that.
[00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:34.512]  It's horrifying to know you're living in the middle of this.
[00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:37.792]  I'm a pretty strong guy, and I have real trouble.
[00:14:37.832 --> 00:14:40.513]  If I didn't have faith in God, I couldn't do it.
[00:14:42.173 --> 00:14:49.535]  So I know why people have trouble dealing with this, because it's just too horrible for their minds to even face or deal with.
[00:14:51.087 --> 00:14:56.069]  But let's talk about some of the things we were right about that just came out in the last week.
[00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:58.970]  Here's the Daily Mail, got picked up all over the world.
[00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:06.014]  WHO chief quote believes COVID did leak from the Wuhan lab, says the European Union.
[00:15:07.154 --> 00:15:09.815]  But they're afraid of what the public will do if they learn that.
[00:15:09.915 --> 00:15:11.916]  Well, we know it came from the lab.
[00:15:12.236 --> 00:15:13.557]  They had records they made it.
[00:15:13.957 --> 00:15:15.478]  They had records they released it.
[00:15:15.818 --> 00:15:18.179]  They had records they approached the Pentagon about releasing it.
[00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:21.630]  It's a nanotech virus.
[00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.211]  Genetically engineered chimeric.
[00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:27.312]  And now, that's all admitted.
[00:15:28.253 --> 00:15:31.814]  And of course, all these big publications came out and groups said, Alex Jones was right!
[00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:37.357]  Our water supply is poisoned with deadly chemicals, says Michael Knowles and others.
[00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:40.118]  Over there at the Daily Wire.
[00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:42.980]  A huge operation they've got going in Tennessee.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.042]  And what did the Environmental Protection Agency say last week?
[00:15:49.534 --> 00:16:06.180]  They said, my goodness, Bisphenol A in the plastic liners of soda cans and juice boxes feminizes boys and hyperfeminizes women.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:14.063]  It makes girls go into puberty early, it makes boys not become masculine, and it gives you cancer.
[00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.644]  Now ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones was not right.
[00:16:19.827 --> 00:16:26.491]  The science has been on record for more than 40 years that they chose the formulas for the plastics.
[00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:27.772]  They've got a bunch of clean plastics.
[00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:33.835]  They chose these plastics that would cause this and would do this.
[00:16:35.056 --> 00:16:38.438]  People go out that have been smart for decades and buy glass bottles for their babies.
[00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:42.941]  They drink out of glass because they don't trust plastic.
[00:16:43.121 --> 00:16:46.683]  There's a whole bunch of plastics that don't leach anything on record.
[00:16:48.510 --> 00:17:12.324]  But they put plastics in products like microwavable trays that have plastic lining that are basically bisphenol A and give you a massive dose of sterilant for men and hyper-feminization for women that doesn't make women look like Marilyn Monroe, it makes them look like bloated ogres.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:23.123]  You ever walked around the shopping mall, and at least you're old enough to remember, and you're like, man, since when are the girls taller than the boys?
[00:17:24.444 --> 00:17:28.305]  And it goes into the hormones and the endocrine disruptors and the studies.
[00:17:28.345 --> 00:17:41.111]  So when I tell you all this, there are tens of thousands of studies from every major prestigious university and medical facility you can imagine, knowing all of this, and they've done it by design.
[00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:48.934]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:50.815]  Here's a Fox News headline.
[00:17:51.276 --> 00:17:57.419]  Forever chemicals in water and packaging can risk health, EPA says, and it goes into what it does.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.180]  Washington Post.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.822]  EPA warns toxic forever chemicals more dangerous than once thought.
[00:18:04.283 --> 00:18:07.345]  See, they know this is all coming out.
[00:18:09.011 --> 00:18:11.872]  So they start getting ahead of it and acting like they didn't know.
[00:18:12.152 --> 00:18:15.153]  Oh, we didn't know 5G caused massive cancer.
[00:18:16.453 --> 00:18:18.814]  Oh, we didn't know these chemicals did that.
[00:18:21.174 --> 00:18:23.915]  The whole microplastic subject is a whole other issue.
[00:18:25.216 --> 00:18:42.567]   Suddenly in Europe, suddenly in the US, government agencies that are constantly testing blood and other tissue samples, Are reporting unprecedented for the first time microplastics in the blood and in the tissue of humans everywhere.
[00:18:43.547 --> 00:18:44.227]  Well, what happened?
[00:18:46.629 --> 00:18:51.191]  Starting two years ago in a global program directed by the World Economic Forum, they brag about it.
[00:18:53.992 --> 00:18:57.994]  They got authorization from the different regulatory agencies around the world.
[00:18:59.502 --> 00:19:05.227]  To spray your food with trackable plastic nanoparticles.
[00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:11.111]  I've been showing you those headlines for a while, but go to the EPA's own website, go to the FDA's own website.
[00:19:11.131 --> 00:19:22.320]  And the FDA and the EPA say, we have no jurisdiction over microplastics and nanotech.
[00:19:22.981 --> 00:19:27.825]  Just type in the headline, nanotech now being sprayed on US food supply.
[00:19:29.801 --> 00:19:34.445]  And you will get government websites telling you they're doing it.
[00:19:34.565 --> 00:19:44.153]  And you can play a clip of Yuval Harari last year saying, we're putting micro nanotech in your food and water to take over your body.
[00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:45.734]  This is our revolution.
[00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:47.255]  The end of humans is here.
[00:19:49.697 --> 00:19:51.419]  There's a Journal of Food and Drug Analysis.
[00:19:52.099 --> 00:19:55.462]  The current application of nanotechnology in food and agriculture.
[00:19:57.724 --> 00:19:58.705]  That's from four years ago.
[00:20:00.916 --> 00:20:02.356]  There's USDA.
[00:20:02.776 --> 00:20:08.296]   Nanotechnology can be used in food production to enhance taste, color, flavor, texture, consistency of a variety of
[00:20:08.296 --> 00:20:08.776]  foods.
[00:20:08.776 --> 00:20:20.776]   So this has been going on for at least a decade, but it's accelerated in the last four or five years.
[00:20:20.776 --> 00:20:30.776]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.421]  And this is a takeover.
[00:20:24.622 --> 00:20:29.743]  The COVID shots create a matrix in the body that begins growing nanotech.
[00:20:30.973 --> 00:20:36.837]  Using your cell's own resources to do this.
[00:20:39.119 --> 00:20:58.432]  And then you wonder why, and we should put a video together of this, Stephen Colbert, CNN, ABC News, the other nighttime host, all of them were given talking points in the last decade to attack me and say Jones is crazy, he claims the liner and juice boxes are making your boys feminine.
[00:21:00.037 --> 00:21:01.798]  Jones claims there's nanotech.
[00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.579]  Jones claims you're being attacked through your food and water.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.802]  To make it about Alex Jones, instead of actually showing the real studies.
[00:21:10.443 --> 00:21:12.264]  Oh, that's not studies saying it.
[00:21:12.664 --> 00:21:14.185]  It's just Alex Jones.
[00:21:18.087 --> 00:21:19.447]  Now who do these people work for?
[00:21:19.527 --> 00:21:20.428]  Why are they doing this?
[00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:22.409]  I'll leave that up to you to figure out.
[00:21:22.689 --> 00:21:23.449]  It's pretty obvious.
[00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:26.111]  It's the folks that aren't very pro-human.
[00:21:28.097 --> 00:21:34.202]  They have a group of people that have signed on to it saying, the post-human era's here, looking forward to the end of humanity.
[00:21:34.462 --> 00:21:38.245]  These are real headlines, Wall Street Journal, NBC News.
[00:21:40.227 --> 00:21:45.932]  And that's just the further vindication of everything we warned you about, what we told you about right there.
[00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:49.755]  A toll-free number to join us on two subjects.
[00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:52.197]  Two subjects.
[00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:54.158]  How do we stop the globalists?
[00:21:54.178 --> 00:21:56.080]  What's the most evil thing they're up to and doing?
[00:21:57.264 --> 00:21:58.445]  Those are the subjects we're covering.
[00:21:58.465 --> 00:21:58.505]  877-789-2539.
[00:22:00.346 --> 00:22:00.506]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:22:00.326 --> 00:22:05.326]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alec.
[00:22:05.326 --> 00:22:15.326]   877-789-2539, your calls, when we come back straight ahead and so much more.
[00:22:15.326 --> 00:22:17.905]  (upbeat music)
[00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:28.005]   The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and the Moderna vaccines
[00:22:28.005 --> 00:22:31.086]  for children as young as six months old.
[00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:32.746]  (upbeat music)
[00:22:32.575 --> 00:22:37.081]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[00:22:37.521 --> 00:22:41.987]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[00:22:42.587 --> 00:22:51.438]  We now know, based on rigorous scientific review, that the vaccines available here in the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[00:22:52.179 --> 00:22:59.383]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[00:23:00.004 --> 00:23:04.046]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[00:23:05.587 --> 00:23:17.854]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:28.378]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors of mRNA technology.
[00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:34.603]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths.
[00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:42.750]  And yet, we are still being lied to by our own government, who wants us to sacrifice our youngest children.
[00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.814]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha, and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[00:23:46.954 --> 00:23:48.535]  I have some really exciting news.
[00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:53.960]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under 5.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.202]  These vaccines are incredibly safe.
[00:23:56.702 --> 00:23:59.044]  They work to prevent serious illness.
[00:23:59.565 --> 00:24:08.353]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated, and now if you're a parent of a kid under 5, this is a great time to go out and get your child protected.
[00:24:08.753 --> 00:24:09.514]  Get them vaccinated.
[00:24:11.064 --> 00:24:19.151]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which we know is a lie.
[00:24:20.372 --> 00:24:27.417]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other vaccine in history.
[00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:35.004]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death.
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:46.109]  There is a well-documented risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys, and severe blood clotting in young women.
[00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:52.812]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[00:24:55.353 --> 00:25:04.896]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[00:25:06.815 --> 00:25:22.750]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[00:25:24.672 --> 00:25:29.457]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[00:25:30.757 --> 00:25:41.666]  The UK reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the US is seeing a 20% increase in deaths and a 10% increase in disability.
[00:25:43.907 --> 00:25:52.954]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[00:25:54.195 --> 00:25:58.679]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[00:26:00.922 --> 00:26:07.922]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:26:07.922 --> 00:26:25.922]  I don't normally play a report.
[00:26:26.795 --> 00:26:32.382]  Twice in a day, much less twice an hour, but it's just so short, so powerful, so documented.
[00:26:33.043 --> 00:26:38.229]  For any listener, you hear him talking about the different pieces of information, the report for TV viewers.
[00:26:38.809 --> 00:26:39.791]  Everything is an article.
[00:26:39.871 --> 00:26:40.872]  Everything is a document.
[00:26:41.613 --> 00:26:45.698]  Establishment loyalists manipulated into sacrificing their own children.
[00:26:47.054 --> 00:26:48.955]  Or at least they tell you their kids are taking the shots.
[00:26:48.995 --> 00:26:49.796]  Don't believe that.
[00:26:50.376 --> 00:26:54.458]  For a minute, the report is at TheInfoWar.tv.
[00:26:54.899 --> 00:26:56.960]  That's the URL that takes you to Band.Video.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.482]  Band.Video URL is blocked on Twitter, Instagram, everywhere else.
[00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:05.164]  But the new URL, they're not censoring yet, is TheInfoWar.tv.
[00:27:05.245 --> 00:27:06.105]  Save some lives.
[00:27:06.705 --> 00:27:08.386]  Defeat the globalists in the Info War.
[00:27:08.807 --> 00:27:14.470]  Go to TheInfoWar.tv or Band.Video and share with everyone you know.
[00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:29.090]  Okay, I'm sitting here looking at hundreds of clips and incredible announcements and war news and economy news and so many things I want to get to.
[00:27:29.751 --> 00:27:32.273]  I'm also going to start taking your phone calls start of the next segment.
[00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:34.896]  But I'm going to go ahead and do this right now.
[00:27:36.177 --> 00:27:38.759]  There is a lot of news out there attacking InfoWars.
[00:27:39.761 --> 00:27:41.361]  A lot of controlled corporate press.
[00:27:41.781 --> 00:27:46.643]  I'm more demonized than any other media figure in modern history.
[00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:50.464]  Trump is more demonized than me, but I'm a close second.
[00:27:51.224 --> 00:27:53.484]  And it's important to know why that is.
[00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:55.205]  They fear populism.
[00:27:55.225 --> 00:27:57.005]  They fear people waking up.
[00:27:57.045 --> 00:27:58.125]  They fear leadership.
[00:27:58.505 --> 00:27:59.306]  They fear the truth.
[00:28:00.426 --> 00:28:16.483]   And it's very important, if they can shut us down and silence us or curtail us, then they can create a false Alex Jones, a straw man, And they can demonize the populist movement by demonizing that straw man.
[00:28:17.244 --> 00:28:25.150]  They can use Infowars and the fake straw man they've created as a mobilizer for their people.
[00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:35.317]  A great example of this is whether you liked Benjamin Netanyahu or were neutral on him or didn't like him, unified dislike of him got him out of office.
[00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:47.583]  Now that Benjamin Netanyahu is gone, that coalition has fallen apart and that government broke up and fell yesterday and today.
[00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:50.205]  And he'll probably be back in.
[00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:52.747]  And it's the same thing.
[00:28:53.187 --> 00:29:01.674]  They don't like Trump because he's a unifier of the populist movement, but he can also be used to energize opposition.
[00:29:02.861 --> 00:29:13.608]  Well, InfoWars is good at unifying populists against tyranny, but if you can silence InfoWars and then misrepresent what InfoWars is, you can use it as a weapon against the people.
[00:29:13.728 --> 00:29:17.610]  That's why I can't just say, hey, hang up my spurs.
[00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.131]  I've already warned everybody.
[00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:20.652]  We've already done all this.
[00:29:21.252 --> 00:29:22.113]  My work is done.
[00:29:22.873 --> 00:29:35.938]   Because they will then misrepresent who we are and use the false Alex Jones they create as this media creature To destroy the Liberty Movement and that's why it's so critical we stay in the fight.
[00:29:35.978 --> 00:29:39.144]  So I'm going to go to break, come back, play some of these key clips and go to your calls.
[00:29:39.164 --> 00:29:40.006]  Let me just say this now.
[00:29:41.522 --> 00:29:45.164]  I try to bring you products that I use that I think are great to stay on air.
[00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:52.106]  And we got some big Bitcoin donations in the last three months that I thought actually put us into the black quite a bit.
[00:29:52.426 --> 00:30:03.731]  Then we did further accounting, brought in some outside accountants, looked at everything, projected forward with product price increases, supply chain problems, and they said, man, it's like God did this.
[00:30:04.972 --> 00:30:10.454]  The money that came in was exactly what you needed to just go into the black.
[00:30:12.543 --> 00:30:21.330]  And pay off past bills and buy enough product to just continue on another three, four, five months.
[00:30:22.331 --> 00:30:25.233]  And so I want to thank everybody that's bought products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:25.253 --> 00:30:31.938]  I want to thank whoever it is that made those big giant Bitcoin donations because we would have been insolvent and imploding right now without you.
[00:30:31.978 --> 00:30:32.899]  You saved InfoWars.
[00:30:32.939 --> 00:30:33.439]  You did that.
[00:30:33.699 --> 00:30:34.320]  That's historic.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.700]  Thank you.
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.741]  That was money well spent.
[00:30:36.903 --> 00:30:40.065]  I want to encourage everybody to go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:49.110]  We're about to have to end the ultimate immune support package with four of our best-selling products.
[00:30:50.971 --> 00:30:55.153]  Vitamin D3 gummies, the multivitamin, X2, and the immune support.
[00:30:55.693 --> 00:30:59.209]   That's 40 That's 60% off.
[00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:00.390]  That's 60% off.
[00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:07.078]  We have Vitamin D3, Immune Support, and Survival Shield X3, all three products, for 50% off.
[00:31:07.419 --> 00:31:09.782]  And we have X2 by itself for 40% off.
[00:31:10.463 --> 00:31:15.229]  Two of the products are about to sell out.
[00:31:17.611 --> 00:31:20.974]  And so we're going to have to pull that special in the next few days.
[00:31:21.014 --> 00:31:29.723]  If you want to get up to 60% off on those and boost your immune system with all the things that are going on with what Biden's saying, go to InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:31:29.963 --> 00:31:33.707]  InfoWarsTore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[00:31:33.807 --> 00:31:37.651]  Also, 2,000 mules on DVDs so you have it so it can't be censored.
[00:31:37.931 --> 00:31:40.454]  And Cub and Land 3 are all available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:51.663]  Alright, we're about to be taking your phone calls on the specific topics of how do we defeat the globalists and what is the most evil project they've got going right now against humanity.
[00:31:52.458 --> 00:32:05.741]  I want to get your take on that and so much more with Joe, Mike, Joe, Mark, Tony, Noah, Digital Dave, John, Jay, Derek, and others here today on this live June 22nd, Wednesday broadcast.
[00:32:05.761 --> 00:32:11.483]  But first, Alex Moyer is a very successful filmmaker in her own right.
[00:32:12.023 --> 00:32:14.365]  Sure, some other great filmmakers as well.
[00:32:15.085 --> 00:32:20.208]  I've said no to a lot of documentary film crews, you know, to basically cover InfoWars.
[00:32:20.228 --> 00:32:21.369]  This is just a distraction.
[00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:23.190]  They're almost always hit pieces.
[00:32:23.831 --> 00:32:28.394]  But she did, I think, a fair job and did a really powerful, entertaining film.
[00:32:28.854 --> 00:32:34.498]  It's about two hours long, and it's going to come out in late July.
[00:32:35.541 --> 00:32:41.104]  And there's some big heavy hitters have seen it and are going to be endorsing it and pushing and promoting it.
[00:32:41.184 --> 00:32:42.104]  I had nothing to do with this.
[00:32:43.145 --> 00:32:43.965]  But it's very interesting.
[00:32:43.985 --> 00:32:45.586]  Just just wait for that in the next month.
[00:32:47.647 --> 00:32:50.389]  You'll see what I'm talking about very, very soon.
[00:32:50.609 --> 00:32:55.431]  This film has a lot of backing and it's not just a one sided Alex Jones love fest.
[00:32:55.451 --> 00:32:56.532]  I think it's very, very fair.
[00:32:57.132 --> 00:32:58.693]  Actually brought some tears to my eyes, but.
[00:33:00.154 --> 00:33:01.956]  Here's the first trailer that dropped today.
[00:33:01.976 --> 00:33:04.919]  If you want to share the trailer, it's posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:13.987]  And then Scott Adams, the well-known artist, cartoonist, and pundit, he had some of his own analysis dealing with it.
[00:33:14.007 --> 00:33:17.090]  And so we're going to play the trailer and then Scott Adams comments back-to-back.
[00:33:18.792 --> 00:33:19.652]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.773 --> 00:33:21.494]  The story you're about to see is truth.
[00:33:21.855 --> 00:33:23.056]  This is reality.
[00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:25.318]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:33:27.386 --> 00:33:30.408]  I'm the most banned, most demonized media person in the world.
[00:33:30.548 --> 00:33:31.769]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:33.030]  He's a performance artist.
[00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.912]  I'm perceived as a clown, a nut, a maniac.
[00:33:37.213 --> 00:33:41.316]  On his website, InfoWars, he touts paranoia porn.
[00:33:41.996 --> 00:33:44.318]  The sickest, most offensive theories.
[00:33:44.918 --> 00:33:50.382]  Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[00:33:50.522 --> 00:33:51.943]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[00:33:52.283 --> 00:33:54.165]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[00:33:56.187 --> 00:33:56.807]  Ain't that simple?
[00:33:58.068 --> 00:34:00.070]  You'll burn in hell!
[00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:01.210]  I met him back in 1990s.
[00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.352]  I knew right away he was gonna be a star.
[00:34:03.812 --> 00:34:04.312]  How's my hair look?
[00:34:04.613 --> 00:34:07.534]  I saw all these conspiracy terrorists that were talking about the New World Order.
[00:34:07.635 --> 00:34:08.575]  And I thought, that's what I'll do.
[00:34:08.615 --> 00:34:09.616]  Get in there, Alex.
[00:34:09.636 --> 00:34:11.977]  Death to the New World Order!
[00:34:11.997 --> 00:34:16.200]  It was that attack on humanity that I saw early on that I really wanted to wage war on.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.281]  You're lying to the public!
[00:34:17.381 --> 00:34:18.141]  It's disgusting!
[00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:19.002]  Well, she'd taste that.
[00:34:19.522 --> 00:34:20.423]  There's no going back.
[00:34:22.859 --> 00:34:23.660]  Everything's a war.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.583]  That's the way the universe works, and everything is propaganda.
[00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:31.748]  I don't trust Donald Trump, but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says.
[00:34:32.068 --> 00:34:33.570]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.372]  I will not let you down.
[00:34:36.753 --> 00:34:38.275]  That's what the media's gloves off.
[00:34:39.324 --> 00:34:44.045]  Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children, was fake.
[00:34:44.285 --> 00:34:46.365]  I try to tell the truth and sometimes I'm wrong.
[00:34:46.645 --> 00:34:53.067]  Did the New York Times get in trouble for consciously lying about WMDs that then led to a war that killed tens of thousands in conflict?
[00:34:53.107 --> 00:34:53.487]  No.
[00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:56.627]  The attempts to platform us have failed.
[00:34:56.827 --> 00:34:59.288]  They have the CIA, the FBI following me around.
[00:34:59.508 --> 00:35:01.128]  Now we've got to destroy Alex Jones.
[00:35:01.248 --> 00:35:02.328]  We're not playing games here.
[00:35:02.468 --> 00:35:05.829]  This is such a historic moment together.
[00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:06.389]  USA!
[00:35:08.348 --> 00:35:09.609]  It's all just insane.
[00:35:10.189 --> 00:35:12.291]  Okay, let's put me in prison for questioning, okay?
[00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:13.152]  Even though that's my right.
[00:35:13.432 --> 00:35:14.893]  In fact, let's execute Alex Jones.
[00:35:15.093 --> 00:35:19.196]  Let's put me in front of a firing squad, pull the trigger.
[00:35:19.276 --> 00:35:20.657]  I have a sick feeling, actually.
[00:35:21.138 --> 00:35:25.681]  Because I know what comes next.
[00:35:26.402 --> 00:35:28.063]  I just looked at a little trailer for that.
[00:35:28.823 --> 00:35:33.547]  And you see just a snippet of Alex Jones defending what he does.
[00:35:34.488 --> 00:35:35.569]  Now, his defense is this.
[00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.968]  That he believes what he says.
[00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:39.889]  To be true.
[00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.650]  And that sometimes he's wrong.
[00:35:44.972 --> 00:35:49.434]  And I look at that and I think... Maybe?
[00:35:51.395 --> 00:35:51.716]  Maybe?
[00:35:51.736 --> 00:35:54.397]  Like, you can't really rule that out, can you?
[00:35:55.478 --> 00:35:56.278]  I mean, think about it.
[00:35:56.698 --> 00:35:59.640]  Think about how easy a target Alex Jones is.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.881]  And then I'm gonna give you his defense.
[00:36:02.402 --> 00:36:03.142]  It's really simple.
[00:36:03.442 --> 00:36:04.543]  It's a very simple defense.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.221]  He believes what he says.
[00:36:09.282 --> 00:36:10.362]  But sometimes he's wrong.
[00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:17.846]  And I hear that and I think, alright, nobody has ever presented evidence that he doesn't believe what he says.
[00:36:19.587 --> 00:36:20.067]  Am I wrong?
[00:36:21.528 --> 00:36:22.889]  And then here's the second part.
[00:36:23.469 --> 00:36:24.629]  Here's the mic drop.
[00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:31.133]  Alex Jones asks us, why would we treat him differently than the New York Times?
[00:36:32.591 --> 00:36:36.854]  Which also presumably believes what it says, but sometimes they're wrong.
[00:36:37.454 --> 00:36:40.176]  Like weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[00:36:40.756 --> 00:36:42.357]  Like really wrong.
[00:36:42.637 --> 00:36:44.478]  Like wrong, start a war wrong.
[00:36:45.159 --> 00:36:46.580]  Like that's as wrong as you can be.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.582]  And Alex Jones says, why would you treat me differently?
[00:36:50.302 --> 00:36:51.803]  We both believed what we said.
[00:36:53.864 --> 00:36:55.105]  And we both could be wrong.
[00:36:57.106 --> 00:37:01.711]   To which I say, Oh shit, that's actually a complete defense.
[00:37:03.752 --> 00:37:06.195]  There's nothing wrong with that defense at all.
[00:37:07.176 --> 00:37:15.924]  The only way he could be thwarted in that defense is if there's some recording of him saying, you know, I make all this stuff up.
[00:37:16.963 --> 00:37:22.728]  Now apparently there is some evidence that he likes the conspiracy theory domain.
[00:37:23.308 --> 00:37:25.150]  So that part I think he said directly.
[00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.093]  I believe that's, you know, also part of the trailer.
[00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:31.876]  But that doesn't mean he doesn't believe it.
[00:37:36.462 --> 00:37:38.443]  But all you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[00:37:38.683 --> 00:37:44.744]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[00:37:45.584 --> 00:37:47.185]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[00:37:48.105 --> 00:37:50.466]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[00:37:51.766 --> 00:37:52.526]  Where do we say that?
[00:37:52.826 --> 00:37:53.546]  We never said that.
[00:37:53.606 --> 00:37:55.927]  They just say we said that.
[00:37:57.187 --> 00:37:57.948]  But where's the clip?
[00:37:58.228 --> 00:37:58.968]  Where's the article?
[00:37:59.368 --> 00:38:00.108]  Where do we say that?
[00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:01.168]  Doesn't exist.
[00:38:01.328 --> 00:38:03.289]  They're lying to you.
[00:38:05.333 --> 00:38:06.513]  Because they think you're stupid.
[00:38:07.814 --> 00:38:12.975]  And it's all based on a custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[00:38:12.995 --> 00:38:21.917]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:23.257]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[00:38:23.657 --> 00:38:24.277]  You'll die.
[00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:24.897]  It's fun.
[00:38:25.277 --> 00:38:26.998]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[00:38:28.061 --> 00:38:31.485]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[00:38:32.105 --> 00:38:38.331]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:51.657]   So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander, or Optimus Prime, or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good, or Darth Vader, Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[00:38:51.797 --> 00:38:52.077]  No.
[00:38:52.617 --> 00:38:55.558]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, The Joker?
[00:38:55.618 --> 00:38:55.779]  No.
[00:38:56.079 --> 00:39:03.262]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[00:39:03.942 --> 00:39:05.423]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:08.404]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[00:39:10.605 --> 00:39:11.946]  But they play those games.
[00:39:14.002 --> 00:39:19.405]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to, even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious.
[00:39:19.746 --> 00:39:24.809]  They clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.471]  And they go, look, he admitted in court, he's an actor.
[00:39:28.731 --> 00:39:31.233]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[00:39:31.613 --> 00:39:32.854]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[00:39:33.234 --> 00:39:36.897]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:46.297]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:47.097]  And you know that!
[00:39:47.738 --> 00:39:48.859]  You're insulted right now.
[00:39:48.879 --> 00:39:50.140]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.283]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[00:39:55.504 --> 00:39:57.465]  Megatron, prepare to die.
[00:39:57.485 --> 00:40:00.868]  Autobots, transform and roll out.
[00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.973]  I was sent to your planet to save it from Megatron.
[00:40:08.424 --> 00:40:09.265]  That's me having fun.
[00:40:09.285 --> 00:40:11.286]  I don't actually believe I'm Optimus Prime.
[00:40:11.886 --> 00:40:14.828]  Or... Cobra!
[00:40:16.189 --> 00:40:17.490]  I'm not actually Cobra Commander.
[00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.270]  Or the Joker.
[00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:20.212]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:40:20.992 --> 00:40:22.733]  And I am the guy on this show every day.
[00:40:23.854 --> 00:40:25.175]  And my mother is Carol Jones.
[00:40:25.215 --> 00:40:26.315]  And my dad is David Jones.
[00:40:27.056 --> 00:40:28.297]  And my sister is Marley Jones.
[00:40:29.117 --> 00:40:30.658]  And I am an American.
[00:40:31.299 --> 00:40:36.322]  And that's what I promote, is freedom, and justice, and liberty, and they can't stand it.
[00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:42.878]  I find your lack of faith disturbing.
[00:40:44.419 --> 00:40:47.201]  Join me and I will complete your training.
[00:40:50.943 --> 00:40:54.105]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:40:55.306 --> 00:40:56.447]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[00:40:58.268 --> 00:41:10.095]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article?
[00:41:11.308 --> 00:41:16.013]  By Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com that has all the cited information.
[00:41:17.194 --> 00:41:19.877]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:41:20.397 --> 00:41:21.899]  No, that's a real thing.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.943]  That's something happening in the real world.
[00:41:29.546 --> 00:41:31.108]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[00:41:32.725 --> 00:41:33.546]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[00:41:33.626 --> 00:41:35.007]  I'll get to your phone calls next hour.
[00:41:35.607 --> 00:41:36.488]  Please stand by.
[00:41:36.608 --> 00:41:41.452]  Looking forward to talking to every single one of you about the big questions we've asked her today.
[00:41:42.413 --> 00:41:43.774]  How do we defeat the globalists?
[00:41:45.335 --> 00:41:47.977]  And what is the most evil project they've got going on?
[00:41:48.378 --> 00:41:49.459]  Is it the geoengineering?
[00:41:49.499 --> 00:41:50.700]  Is it imploding borders?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.141]  Is it virus releases?
[00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:54.703]  Is it the transgender movement targeting our children?
[00:41:55.283 --> 00:41:57.145]  Is it the legalization of pedophilia?
[00:41:57.205 --> 00:41:57.965]  The push to do it?
[00:41:59.627 --> 00:42:02.109]  Is it the push to give these deadly injections to children?
[00:42:03.399 --> 00:42:04.780]  There's not a push, it's happening now.
[00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:07.462]  What is the big issues?
[00:42:07.882 --> 00:42:10.784]  So we can identify it and mobilize against it and defeat it.
[00:42:10.804 --> 00:42:12.685]  Hour 2, straight ahead.
[00:42:12.505 --> 00:42:23.224]  Stay with us.
[00:42:23.233 --> 00:42:27.355]  Thank you for joining us on this June 22nd, Wednesday broadcast.
[00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:32.479]  We are going to be taking your phone calls coming up next segment.
[00:42:34.104 --> 00:42:49.795]  But I want to just get back to Greg Reese's report with the FDA board, the fourth board they've created, the other boards wouldn't do it, to not just give children the shots, but babies six months old and older, these deadly shots.
[00:42:49.815 --> 00:43:05.355]   I'm going to play a clip coming up here in a moment that deals with all of this with Steve Kirsch, because it's so important to understand that even if you believe their Koch statistics, This is not protecting people.
[00:43:07.336 --> 00:43:08.897]  It's erasing their immune systems.
[00:43:09.558 --> 00:43:14.300]  It's causing very, very serious health problems.
[00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:22.365]  And if they can get away with this, they believe they can get away with anything.
[00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:26.027]  So we're going to play clip 19 here in just a minute or so.
[00:43:27.298 --> 00:43:29.279]  With Steve Kirsch, the great investigative journalist.
[00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:38.101]  He says, so you've killed 150,000, that's a conservative number, that's what they admit, in order to maybe save 10,000 lives.
[00:43:38.801 --> 00:43:47.284]  Many people died in the vaccine group in the first placebo group, and it takes 22,000 vaccines to save one life from COVID.
[00:43:48.284 --> 00:43:52.225]  But it's about testing how many of us can they kill.
[00:43:53.326 --> 00:43:58.862]   It's about Testing, what can they get away with?
[00:43:59.663 --> 00:44:00.603]  How dumb are we?
[00:44:00.683 --> 00:44:02.464]  Can they start depopulating us?
[00:44:02.884 --> 00:44:04.485]  Can they launch the next pandemic?
[00:44:04.885 --> 00:44:08.106]  Can they launch stuff way worse than COVID, which was a real attack?
[00:44:09.266 --> 00:44:13.308]  If you have your minerals and vitamins and stuff, you're basically protected, all the evidence shows.
[00:44:14.708 --> 00:44:16.569]  So that's where we are dealing with all this.
[00:44:18.462 --> 00:44:22.343]  And we're all being tested right now to see what we will accept.
[00:44:22.383 --> 00:44:24.503]  You know, I think that's the most important thing to say.
[00:44:25.203 --> 00:44:26.444]  How do you defeat the globalists?
[00:44:26.484 --> 00:44:28.964]  You realize you're being tested to see what you'll put up with.
[00:44:29.484 --> 00:44:34.986]  And you expose them, and you mobilize against them, and you say no to them, and you boycott them, and you run for office.
[00:44:35.466 --> 00:44:40.327]  It doesn't matter if you're a city council member, or a mayor, or a governor, or a legislator, or in Congress.
[00:44:40.667 --> 00:44:45.808]  The world's looking for leadership right now to defend against this and stop it.
[00:44:46.704 --> 00:44:57.067]  We've got this clip of Steve Kersh, we'll come back from break, but a clip of Governor DeSantis, that I promise, the full hour, your phone calls, and then Leo Zegami pops in, we'll go back to your phone calls, but here's the report.
[00:44:58.207 --> 00:45:12.251]  Now, we all know, in the Pfizer trial that was published in the medical literature, that more people died who got the vaccine, than who got the placebo.
[00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:15.272]  In other words, the vaccine killed more people.
[00:45:16.229 --> 00:45:17.109]  Then the placebo did.
[00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:20.190]  Now, it's not supposed to work that way for a vaccine, right?
[00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:21.530]  Vaccines are supposed to save lives.
[00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:27.812]  But in fact, in the clinical trial, more people died who got the drug than who didn't get the drug.
[00:45:28.612 --> 00:45:40.335]  And the reason is because that the clinical trial showed that you could save one life for every 22,000 people who got the drug from COVID.
[00:45:41.996 --> 00:45:47.807]   However, more people died Who got the drug because they died from different reasons.
[00:45:47.827 --> 00:45:49.108]  They died from the vaccine.
[00:45:49.948 --> 00:45:53.611]  But see, everybody is focused on how many lives we can save from COVID.
[00:45:54.471 --> 00:45:58.274]  And they're not focused on how many deaths were caused by the vaccine.
[00:45:59.094 --> 00:46:00.355]  So I did a calculation.
[00:46:01.136 --> 00:46:12.744]  Well, it turns out that when you say one person for every 22,000 people you inject, it means we could have saved that the vaccines have saved 10,000 lives over the course of a year.
[00:46:13.865 --> 00:46:14.126]  10,000 lives.
[00:46:14.486 --> 00:46:16.547]  Now, 3 million people die every year.
[00:46:17.568 --> 00:46:19.029]  You just saved 10,000 lives.
[00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.850]  Congratulations!
[00:46:20.510 --> 00:46:21.531]  That's rounding error.
[00:46:22.211 --> 00:46:29.597]  We turned this country upside down to save just 10,000 lives.
[00:46:30.177 --> 00:46:32.179]  But we actually didn't save 10,000 lives.
[00:46:33.259 --> 00:46:42.206]  Because when you look at the VAERS numbers, and you look at it 12 different ways that didn't even use VAERS, you come up with at least 150,000 people who have been killed by the vaccine.
[00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:44.330]  There's no other explanation.
[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:50.614]  So you killed 150,000 in order to maybe save 10,000 lives.
[00:46:51.254 --> 00:46:55.857]  And that's if the actual variant matched the vaccine, which it doesn't.
[00:46:57.938 --> 00:47:03.581]  So in other words, and for kids, by the way, the risk-benefit is even worse.
[00:47:03.802 --> 00:47:09.802]   It's a... we kill a hundred and seventeen kids to save one life.
[00:47:09.802 --> 00:47:11.802]  Okay, questions.
[00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:11.801]  Yes, sir.
[00:47:11.821 --> 00:47:17.903]  Governor, there's obviously a lot of controversy at the end of last week between your administration and the White House.
[00:47:17.963 --> 00:47:22.884]  What do you make of the White House saying that the state reversed on child vaccines?
[00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:24.704]  So the White House is lying about it.
[00:47:25.224 --> 00:47:26.664]  We are surprised.
[00:47:27.285 --> 00:47:28.905]  Not surprised the White House would lie.
[00:47:29.145 --> 00:47:33.846]  Definitely not surprised that legacy media would amplify the lie, because that's what they do.
[00:47:34.506 --> 00:47:42.654]  The state of Florida, they came out with an article saying the state of Florida has not ordered, its Department of Health has not ordered mRNA jabs for the babies.
[00:47:42.814 --> 00:47:43.595]  Yes, we didn't.
[00:47:44.015 --> 00:47:45.296]  We recommend against it.
[00:47:45.637 --> 00:47:52.123]  We are not going to have any programs where we're trying to jab six-month-old babies with mRNA.
[00:47:52.443 --> 00:47:53.324]  That's just the reality.
[00:47:58.112 --> 00:48:03.355]  And I think what happened was they thought somehow we would be embarrassed by that.
[00:48:03.395 --> 00:48:04.855]  No, we're following the data.
[00:48:04.895 --> 00:48:06.516]  You look at these European countries.
[00:48:07.717 --> 00:48:12.659]  A lot of them don't even allow Moderna for under age 30, or they recommend against it.
[00:48:12.959 --> 00:48:14.000]  So that was always that.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.200]  We still have not ordered it.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.101]  We're not going to order it.
[00:48:16.421 --> 00:48:21.604]  Now what they're saying is because practitioners and hospitals can order it, somehow we've reversed.
[00:48:21.824 --> 00:48:24.285]  I said from the beginning they'll be able to do that.
[00:48:24.525 --> 00:48:33.609]  We don't have the authority to prevent it and quite frankly if someone wants to make a different decision I would just caution people look at the actual data in the clinical trial.
[00:48:33.889 --> 00:48:38.771]  It is the weakest possible data that you could possibly see.
[00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:44.532]   Very small number of people what the recommendation is from them, doesn't even track
[00:48:44.532 --> 00:48:45.292]  the outcomes.
[00:48:45.292 --> 00:48:49.251]   It was something that, but people can ask their pediatricians, they can ask their
[00:48:49.251 --> 00:48:53.411]   doctors, what's the evidence of protection against severe disease?
[00:48:53.411 --> 00:48:55.052]   There was none in the clinical trial.
[00:48:55.052 --> 00:49:01.331]   But that's something that people would do. But for us, Joe Latipo, our Department of Health has looked at it.
[00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:07.386]  There is no proven benefit to put a baby with an mRNA.
[00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:09.567]  So that's why our recommendation is against it.
[00:49:09.768 --> 00:49:14.291]  That's different than prohibiting the use in Florida, which we don't have the authority to do.
[00:49:14.491 --> 00:49:18.535]  And quite frankly, you know, we're confident people can make their own judgments on it.
[00:49:18.695 --> 00:49:26.879]   But I would say when you look at the trial, one of the things they did, they did not have Babies or very young kids who had recovered from COVID in the trial.
[00:49:27.119 --> 00:49:30.099]  So we don't know what this will do for people that have recovered.
[00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:40.081]  But in their recommendation, they are recommending giving the mRNA shot to people, young babies and kids that have already recovered from COVID.
[00:49:40.321 --> 00:49:42.782]  They don't have any clinical data on that.
[00:49:43.102 --> 00:49:54.105]   And people have looked at some of this stuff and have recognized how that and you know what the White House is bragging that we're the only country That is trying to do mRNA shots for infants.
[00:49:54.486 --> 00:49:56.127]  And I'm just thinking to myself, well, wait a minute.
[00:49:56.387 --> 00:49:59.969]  There's nothing wrong with being the Lone Ranger, if you're right.
[00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:12.218]  But the other countries in Europe that are going a different direction, similar to the direction Florida's gone, they have been right on COVID way more than Fauci and his crew have been throughout this whole thing.
[00:50:12.538 --> 00:50:18.161]  Remember, these are people in Washington that rejected the idea of natural immunity.
[00:50:18.721 --> 00:50:23.763]  For a year and a half, they said that the vaccine was better than prior infection.
[00:50:23.803 --> 00:50:28.226]  And every credible study that's been done has said that that's not the case.
[00:50:28.266 --> 00:50:30.226]  And so they've been wrong time and time again.
[00:50:30.567 --> 00:50:33.568]  They were wrong when they criticized me for having schools open.
[00:50:33.588 --> 00:50:36.710]  They wanted our kids locked out of school in the state of Florida.
[00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:41.652]  They were wrong when they criticized me for having businesses open, beaches, all these other things.
[00:50:42.052 --> 00:50:49.198]  And so this is an example where they are pushing this with very, very, very scant data.
[00:50:49.538 --> 00:50:53.201]  But again, people can make their judgments, but ask questions.
[00:50:53.301 --> 00:51:06.552]  And the fact of the matter is, I think what this whole year and a half has shown us is these regulatory agencies in the federal government have basically become subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:51:06.652 --> 00:51:11.553]   They are not independent regulators, they basically are there to rubber
[00:51:11.553 --> 00:51:13.472]  stamp what Pfizer wants to do.
[00:51:13.472 --> 00:51:19.711]   So people can make their judgments on it, but we have not ordered any for the Department of Health.
[00:51:19.711 --> 00:51:23.472]  There's been absolutely zero change in our recommendations.
[00:51:23.472 --> 00:51:29.152]   And the recommendations, remember, we were the first state to recommend against 6- to 11-year-olds.
[00:51:29.225 --> 00:51:31.587]  We never had any state programs for any of that.
[00:51:31.807 --> 00:51:35.530]  There have been some practitioners that have ordered it, and some have gotten it.
[00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:41.294]  Most parents are not giving it for the kids with the MNRA, but some did, and I think it's the same thing.
[00:51:41.334 --> 00:51:46.278]  So this is a continuation of our policy that we've had in place really since the spring.
[00:51:47.506 --> 00:51:49.989]  Well, I really liked DeSantis before, but I love him.
[00:51:50.029 --> 00:51:51.951]  That's exactly what Trump should be saying.
[00:51:52.572 --> 00:51:54.534]  Hey, these regulatory agencies lied to us.
[00:51:54.574 --> 00:51:55.515]  This is a fraud.
[00:51:57.298 --> 00:51:58.239]  We should stop this.
[00:51:58.279 --> 00:51:59.000]  Here's the evidence.
[00:52:00.441 --> 00:52:01.322]  That's leadership.
[00:52:02.102 --> 00:52:03.464]  He needs to be the next president.
[00:52:04.885 --> 00:52:07.067]  100% behind what DeSantis is doing.
[00:52:07.567 --> 00:52:08.528]  That was powerful.
[00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:09.308]  That was truth.
[00:52:09.769 --> 00:52:14.633]  That is an example of how we defeat the globalists with the truth and the science and the facts.
[00:52:14.653 --> 00:52:17.836]  I am just blown away by DeSantis at this point.
[00:52:18.196 --> 00:52:20.958]  He is the man we should be behind.
[00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:24.862]  There's no way he'd be saying all that if he was a Trojan horse.
[00:52:25.422 --> 00:52:27.384]  There's no way he'd be doing that.
[00:52:28.184 --> 00:52:29.445]  This guy is for real.
[00:52:29.465 --> 00:52:30.606]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.067]  It is simply amazing.
[00:52:32.087 --> 00:52:34.168]  All right, let's start going to your phone calls here.
[00:52:34.188 --> 00:52:35.509]  I just had to play that at Santa's Club.
[00:52:35.929 --> 00:52:36.770]  It's just so amazing.
[00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:41.073]  Let's go to Jay in North Carolina talking about how to defeat the globalists.
[00:52:41.113 --> 00:52:42.334]  Tell us how to do that.
[00:52:43.915 --> 00:52:44.795]  Alex, can you hear me?
[00:52:44.975 --> 00:52:45.315]  I can.
[00:52:45.356 --> 00:52:45.616]  Go ahead.
[00:52:46.256 --> 00:52:47.337]  Man, this is amazing.
[00:52:47.417 --> 00:52:56.643]  I'm a first-time caller and, I mean, first time ever to... Anyway, I almost made it on the Pete Santilli Show, but something went wrong.
[00:52:57.478 --> 00:53:01.301]  And I'm glad to just be talking to you right now.
[00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:03.003]  And I appreciate it.
[00:53:03.023 --> 00:53:03.743]  I appreciate you.
[00:53:03.783 --> 00:53:04.224]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:53:04.324 --> 00:53:04.764]  Thank you.
[00:53:04.964 --> 00:53:12.690]  Well, you have for a year and a half of my life really been helping me put pieces together.
[00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:21.878]  I think I found you on a documentary talking about Washington, D.C.
[00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:25.961]  and just showed short clips from the Bohemian Grove.
[00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:31.290]  The fact that all these years you've been nailing it on the head.
[00:53:32.051 --> 00:53:40.517]  The biggest problem we have, the Bible tells us, we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places.
[00:53:41.578 --> 00:53:47.802]  So, this is the same scenario over and over again, and you've exposed this satanic element.
[00:53:48.883 --> 00:53:56.131]   Because of that, I feel like that would be their most Needful thing.
[00:53:56.491 --> 00:53:58.872]  They may not believe they're talking to demons.
[00:53:59.632 --> 00:54:02.192]  They may not believe that what they're doing is evil.
[00:54:03.832 --> 00:54:08.053]  But somehow, some way, it has to be exposed for what it is.
[00:54:08.613 --> 00:54:11.474]  So you're saying the answer is it's a spiritual battle.
[00:54:11.494 --> 00:54:11.934]  I agree.
[00:54:12.354 --> 00:54:17.275]  Realizing it's a fight between good and evil is the most important thing to do to defeat the new world order.
[00:54:17.835 --> 00:54:19.215]  How can we do that together?
[00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:20.875]  I want to encourage you.
[00:54:21.455 --> 00:54:22.676]  I want to exhort you.
[00:54:22.736 --> 00:54:24.496]  You share the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:54:25.242 --> 00:54:32.226]  That, to me, puts you in a league that few can handle.
[00:54:32.526 --> 00:54:38.249]  Because the pressure of being unashamed is constantly coming at you.
[00:54:38.369 --> 00:54:39.270]  That's it.
[00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:43.492]  If you talk about Jesus and God in a spiritual battle, that's when they come after you.
[00:54:43.512 --> 00:54:44.693]  Because that's the solution.
[00:54:45.173 --> 00:54:46.794]  It doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[00:54:46.814 --> 00:54:48.715]  It doesn't mean I'm up here telling people how to live.
[00:54:49.095 --> 00:54:50.736]  I just know it's a fight between good and evil.
[00:54:50.816 --> 00:54:51.997]  I know Jesus is the answer.
[00:54:52.877 --> 00:54:54.518]  He's the enemy number one to them.
[00:54:55.816 --> 00:54:57.617]  You know, we're attached to his hip.
[00:54:58.217 --> 00:55:01.158]  He said, because you support me, you will be persecuted.
[00:55:01.318 --> 00:55:03.019]  Right, they hated me, they're gonna hate you.
[00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:06.660]  It's not something that we should resent.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.540]  No, we should be glad.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.221]  Believe me, yes.
[00:55:10.841 --> 00:55:18.544]  Blessed are you, Alex, when men revile you and persecute you and speak all manners of evil against you falsely for his namesake.
[00:55:19.004 --> 00:55:19.984]  For yours is the kingdom.
[00:55:20.384 --> 00:55:28.196]   And because of this element that you have become in the United States of America, People are like DeSantis.
[00:55:28.216 --> 00:55:32.097]  You just said DeSantis, but I'm guaranteeing you he's listening to your broadcast.
[00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:36.018]  I'm guaranteeing it because he understands where you come from.
[00:55:36.518 --> 00:55:40.219]  You come from the place where no one wants to admit they've been.
[00:55:40.679 --> 00:55:41.819]  And you've not been ashamed.
[00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:46.901]  You've not ever, as far as I've been listening to you, you've been telling on yourself.
[00:55:47.641 --> 00:55:51.822]  You're not hiding the fact that you're a flawed human being.
[00:55:52.442 --> 00:56:01.001]   You know, so you're really defeating them Because you take from them the only weapon that they have to use against you, and that's your flaws.
[00:56:02.302 --> 00:56:04.944]  So you're kind of like... Beautifully said, brother, and I hear you.
[00:56:05.224 --> 00:56:05.765]  And you're right.
[00:56:07.146 --> 00:56:08.087]  I said, what is the answer?
[00:56:08.107 --> 00:56:09.328]  Because I wanted to hear it from you guys.
[00:56:09.908 --> 00:56:12.711]  And you, the first caller, you were the first caller in on the board.
[00:56:12.731 --> 00:56:14.312]  I went and ordered their receipt.
[00:56:14.332 --> 00:56:15.974]  You said, it is a spiritual battle.
[00:56:16.274 --> 00:56:17.095]  Beautifully said, Jay.
[00:56:17.115 --> 00:56:18.155]  I appreciate you from North Carolina.
[00:56:18.175 --> 00:56:19.537]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:56:20.683 --> 00:56:22.523]  I get to everybody in this hour that's holding right now.
[00:56:22.543 --> 00:56:27.204]  We're gonna come back and go to Joe and John and so many others on the other side.
[00:56:28.485 --> 00:56:30.245]  Remember, it's an information war.
[00:56:30.325 --> 00:56:33.526]  The enemy is working around the clock to block what?
[00:56:34.286 --> 00:56:35.686]  This information getting out.
[00:56:35.986 --> 00:56:36.907]  What do they hate the most?
[00:56:36.927 --> 00:56:37.667]  This broadcast.
[00:56:38.067 --> 00:56:38.967]  Share the live feeds.
[00:56:39.287 --> 00:56:41.188]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:56:41.528 --> 00:56:42.448]  Band.video.
[00:56:42.788 --> 00:56:44.548]  TheInfoWar.tv.
[00:56:45.008 --> 00:56:46.409]  TheInfoWar.tv.
[00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:47.129]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:48.496 --> 00:56:50.436]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here on the live show.
[00:56:50.456 --> 00:56:51.337]  We're taking your calls.
[00:56:52.097 --> 00:56:55.497]  How to defeat the New World Order, what's the most evil thing they're up to, and how do we stop them?
[00:56:56.277 --> 00:56:58.298]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:57:00.618 --> 00:57:01.438]  Hello, can you hear me Alex?
[00:57:01.538 --> 00:57:02.258]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[00:57:03.499 --> 00:57:13.661]  First time caller, just been listening to you for about a year, and man, you've been very impactful on my life, and I know so many others, and just want to say we're glad to have you back in the studio, and we really missed you last week.
[00:57:13.681 --> 00:57:14.661]  Hope you got some good rest.
[00:57:16.815 --> 00:57:19.216]  I guess to start off, how do we stop the globalists?
[00:57:19.276 --> 00:57:21.796]  I believe it's imperative kind of dovetailing off the last caller.
[00:57:21.816 --> 00:57:23.377]  We've got to lose our fear of man.
[00:57:23.737 --> 00:57:31.639]  We've got to be able to speak out in the public square and alerting everyone to the crimes against humanity that you have awakened so many of us to.
[00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:35.140]  And also, what's their plan in the future?
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.200]  Their coming global attack.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:37.880]  We've got to speak out.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.601]  And one easy way that I did that, I bought the Alex Jones is Right t-shirt.
[00:57:41.921 --> 00:57:44.302]  I went to the Trump rally in Memphis this past weekend.
[00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.411]  And let me tell you, I felt like a rock star walking around with that t-shirt on.
[00:57:48.871 --> 00:57:52.832]  I was getting high fives, fist bumps, you know, I gotta get me one of those shirts.
[00:57:53.172 --> 00:57:57.313]  We went to our seats, my wife and I, we had great seats, right to stage left.
[00:57:58.254 --> 00:57:59.494]  Real quickly, Don Jr.
[00:57:59.534 --> 00:58:03.855]  comes out, he sees the shirt, it's like I was highlighted.
[00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:07.616]  He just locked in on me during, I mean, half of his talk, he was talking right to me.
[00:58:08.228 --> 00:58:09.669]  He mentioned the globalists.
[00:58:09.749 --> 00:58:13.332]  I know it was a direct result of that shirt.
[00:58:13.432 --> 00:58:15.613]  Trump comes out, same thing, sees the shirt.
[00:58:16.794 --> 00:58:27.161]  It's just a small way that I believe we can speak out for this whole message because everyone understands the Alex Jones messages, the message of the globalists and the elite and what they're doing.
[00:58:27.922 --> 00:58:41.568]   And it was almost like the tale of two stories because after the rally was over with, my wife and I, we go to kind of a a bougie area of Memphis and go eat, uh, go, gonna go have
[00:58:41.568 --> 00:58:46.077]   a Thai meal. So we get out of our car walking across the parking lot, gonna enjoy a good dinner
[00:58:46.077 --> 00:58:51.928]   at a Thai restaurant. And this elderly gentleman walks out with his wife getting into his nice
[00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:57.198]   little sports car. And he, and he, he looks up at me, he sees the shirt and he yells out across the
[00:58:57.198 --> 00:59:03.417]   parking lot. It's like a, the devil came out of the man. He says, Alex Jones was not right. And I just
[00:59:03.417 --> 00:59:07.618]   lifted the shirt off my chest. And I said, Sir, Alex Jones was right.
[00:59:08.052 --> 00:59:13.855]  He sits down in his car, sticks his finger out, flips me off, yells some obscenities out the window.
[00:59:14.416 --> 00:59:19.358]  And instead of reciprocating in kind, I calmly walked to his window.
[00:59:19.798 --> 00:59:21.319]  I asked him to roll the window down.
[00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:31.904]  I said, Sir, I just want you to realize my wife and I were just trying to walk across the park lot and go have a nice meal, and you are behaving, you know, completely erratic, out of control.
[00:59:31.964 --> 00:59:33.165]  Like, what's going on with you?
[00:59:33.567 --> 00:59:34.828]  He starts to apologize.
[00:59:35.088 --> 00:59:36.108]  I didn't have anything to do with him.
[00:59:36.148 --> 00:59:44.133]  I walk away and my wife walks up and begins this conversation with him about the globalists and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and all these things, you know.
[00:59:44.153 --> 00:59:46.174]  So we go in, we sit down.
[00:59:46.834 --> 00:59:50.496]  The waitress that waits on us, she's like, Oh my God, Alex Jones.
[00:59:50.676 --> 00:59:51.317]  I love that.
[00:59:51.337 --> 00:59:57.420]  She was like, she starts, we had this long conversation over the mail about Alex Jones and everything that's going on with the globalists.
[00:59:57.819 --> 00:59:59.961]  She says, my car's covered in bumper stickers.
[01:00:00.001 --> 01:00:03.704]  We go outside after dinner, drive around the back of the car, back of the restaurant.
[01:00:03.764 --> 01:00:08.147]  Sure enough, you know, Trump's, uh, Alex Jones stickers all over.
[01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:12.951]  One of the people in the restaurant come out of the back and, and my wife yells out, Alex Jones is right!
[01:00:13.031 --> 01:00:15.513]  And the guy calmly is like, heck yeah he was.
[01:00:15.853 --> 01:00:22.178]  I mean, we just had the best night, but wearing that shirt is just this one small way to get in the public square.
[01:00:22.825 --> 01:00:24.386]  And proclaim the message.
[01:00:24.406 --> 01:00:26.628]  We have got to alert everyone around us.
[01:00:26.888 --> 01:00:27.488]  What is going on?
[01:00:27.508 --> 01:00:28.469]  Well, John, let me say this.
[01:00:28.509 --> 01:00:41.979]  I'm so glad you called because when I tell the story how I get mobbed when I was on a business vacation trip, mobbed at airports, mobbed at grocery stores, mobbed at hotels, mobbed at restaurants, mobbed, black, white, old, young, didn't matter.
[01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.483]  Liberty's popular, but the average person doesn't know how many people are awake.
[01:00:46.823 --> 01:00:50.346]  But wearing one of these Alex Jones is right shirts, by the way, were sold out.
[01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:51.567]  They're now back in stock.
[01:00:51.587 --> 01:00:56.812]  The regular one and designer one really lets you break through and see how many people are actually awake.
[01:00:56.832 --> 01:00:57.793]  It's an amazing adventure.
[01:00:58.293 --> 01:01:01.436]  But I want to thank you, sir, for calling and just God bless you.
[01:01:01.456 --> 01:01:02.297]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:03.178 --> 01:01:06.361]  And yes, we are battling to stay on air.
[01:01:07.654 --> 01:01:23.459]  And I'm so thankful to the people that buy products in 4Short.com, but I've been so busy that for three weeks we had the regular, it's actually a very nice expensive shirt for us to make, Alex Jones's Rice shirt, but I wanted a designer shirt.
[01:01:24.346 --> 01:01:28.628]  Well, the designer shirt is now in at infowarestore.com.
[01:01:29.189 --> 01:01:33.871]  And again, it causes a big uproar when you wear it.
[01:01:33.911 --> 01:01:35.412]  Believe me, I don't lie to you.
[01:01:35.752 --> 01:01:39.814]  Sometimes I'm a little wrong about things, but I never purposely steer you wrong.
[01:01:40.374 --> 01:01:42.055]  You want to see what it's like to be Alex Jones?
[01:01:42.636 --> 01:01:43.356]  Wear one of these shirts.
[01:01:43.396 --> 01:01:48.138]  Now listen, you might get hit in the head with a ball-peen hammer or stabbed, too.
[01:01:48.699 --> 01:01:52.501]  Now, you'll shake 200 hands before somebody takes a swing at you.
[01:01:53.021 --> 01:01:56.205]  But I want to tell you, you wear one of these shirts, watch your ass.
[01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.288]  Because you're going to be Alex Jones at that point.
[01:01:58.869 --> 01:02:01.633]  Wear the shirt, you'll experience the adventure for yourself.
[01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:04.396]  And you'll go, my god, I didn't know this many people are awake.
[01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:04.977]  Did you hear him?
[01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.220]  He goes to a Trump rally, he's mobbed.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:10.525]  He goes to a restaurant, has three, four contacts that are positive.
[01:02:11.821 --> 01:02:13.222]  One contact that was in his face.
[01:02:13.342 --> 01:02:14.823]  That is exactly what it's like.
[01:02:15.624 --> 01:02:17.766]  I want you to experience it.
[01:02:18.346 --> 01:02:22.149]  And then it puts money into operation to stay on air, to keep putting the message out.
[01:02:22.189 --> 01:02:27.233]  But yes, they are enraged at how successful and informative InfoWars is.
[01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:31.195]  And all the glory goes to God and the listeners and the crew.
[01:02:31.496 --> 01:02:32.677]  I'm just a focal point of this.
[01:02:33.617 --> 01:02:35.799]  And I get all the attacks too.
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.001]  Look out what you ask for.
[01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.963]  But listen, it's all in God's hands at this point.
[01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:43.770]  This is a limited edition, by the way.
[01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:46.591]  This last run, these shirts will not be made again.
[01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:48.092]  They'll be a new Alex Jones is Right shirt.
[01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:49.373]  But people kept asking for it.
[01:02:49.873 --> 01:02:50.393]  You got it.
[01:02:50.513 --> 01:02:51.594]  It's extremely popular.
[01:02:51.654 --> 01:02:54.455]  If you want to get it, there's the designer shirt.
[01:02:55.576 --> 01:02:57.136]  Costs us like $18 a shirt.
[01:02:58.257 --> 01:02:59.778]  The other shirt really is a designer as well.
[01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:01.899]  It costs us $11, $12 a shirt.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.500]  But they're both available.
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.461]  They're great for men and women.
[01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:07.361]  Infowarshort.com.
[01:03:07.401 --> 01:03:08.262]  Okay, I'm done plugging.
[01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:14.706]  I'm done plugging, because if I go to break, or if I go to calls now, I'm going to cut you off short, I'm going to come back, do this.
[01:03:14.746 --> 01:03:16.087]  Sagami's great, he'll understand.
[01:03:17.087 --> 01:03:22.851]  Let's push Sagami back to 15 after next hour, then I'll do 45 minutes with him, because he's a smart guy, I'm going to talk to him about the waterfront.
[01:03:23.752 --> 01:03:25.153]  Boy, is he a guy that predicts everything.
[01:03:25.673 --> 01:03:28.675]  That way we'll have plenty of time to get to all these callers.
[01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:30.776]  Up next, who's the longest holding?
[01:03:31.137 --> 01:03:35.660]  That'll be John, Joe, Digital Dave, everybody.
[01:03:36.738 --> 01:03:42.099]  These callers are all great, but no matter how good your call is, I've got to cut you off at two minutes or we'll never get to everybody.
[01:03:42.139 --> 01:03:43.679]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.820]  You know, I wish we could fund this operation with Alex Jones's Rise shirts.
[01:03:49.661 --> 01:03:55.582]  I think we've sold like 15,000 of them, but that's over three months.
[01:03:56.562 --> 01:04:00.383]  And so if you're making $10 on a shirt, that's not going to pay for the uplinks and the bandwidth.
[01:04:00.643 --> 01:04:01.403]  And I'm not complaining.
[01:04:02.335 --> 01:04:07.658]  And we're looking at trying to cut the quality of the videos at Bandop Video and stuff because it's just moderate quality.
[01:04:08.479 --> 01:04:11.261]  But man, $200,000, $300,000 bills a month.
[01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:17.805]  I mean, we got 5, 6, 7 million people a day watching videos at Bandop Video, which I love.
[01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:18.745]  It's what I want.
[01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:20.306]  But we don't have YouTube.
[01:04:20.406 --> 01:04:21.307]  We don't have Twitter.
[01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.648]  We don't have Instagram.
[01:04:22.708 --> 01:04:24.629]  We are paying for it all.
[01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:28.452]  And I've already spent 90% of the money for my house sale.
[01:04:29.352 --> 01:04:32.734]  And I've already spent almost all the money I've got and I don't even care about that.
[01:04:33.435 --> 01:04:40.039]  Except I care about the tank running low and thinking, what will it be like when I finally got to start shutting stuff down?
[01:04:40.179 --> 01:04:40.759]  I don't want to do that.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.601]  I can't imagine that's going to happen.
[01:04:42.941 --> 01:04:44.422]  So I'm asking folks, step up.
[01:04:44.902 --> 01:04:51.812]   Get an Alex Jones was right shirt at m4warrestore.com while you get The Ultimate Immune Support Pack.
[01:04:52.173 --> 01:04:53.776]  Four different products, 60% off.
[01:04:54.076 --> 01:04:55.318]  That sale ends in the next few days.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:05:01.048]  And we've got 50% off on the Trifecta Immune Support and 40% off on X2.
[01:05:01.068 --> 01:05:02.150]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:04.031]  Here's an interesting fact though.
[01:05:04.651 --> 01:05:21.684]  If you believe that vaccines are the best thing in the world and that they're the necessary solution to the problem of the pandemic, and I know there are people that believe that as well, a significant number of people believe that, then shouldn't they have been made readily available in poorer countries or does it only matter that richer countries have access to that medicine?
[01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:23.145]  There's a problem there.
[01:05:23.345 --> 01:05:30.409]  Particularly when these ideas are couched in neoliberalist politics that are all about fairness and sharing and kindness.
[01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:36.293]  And whenever there's any cynicism and doubt, you're a conspiracy theorist, you're a nutter, you're against progress, follow the science.
[01:05:36.313 --> 01:05:40.976]  We've just heard the problem with following the science is that the science follows the money.
[01:05:41.436 --> 01:05:42.397]  That's the issue.
[01:05:42.697 --> 01:05:44.899]  Science is a subset of commerce.
[01:05:45.299 --> 01:05:50.682]  Truly objective science, as is being suggested here, independent networks focused on scientific endeavour.
[01:05:50.902 --> 01:05:51.683]  Of course we want that.
[01:05:51.923 --> 01:06:06.554]  You'd have to be an idiot to sort of deny the effectiveness of bloody geniuses in laboratories looking at cells and examining the behaviour of viruses in medicine, although I would suggest there is some evidence that implies that that should be conducted with extreme caution!
[01:06:06.574 --> 01:06:10.157]  Especially if you're near a wet market, all sorts of stuff comes out of those things!
[01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:18.003]  But science within extreme commercial and financial imperatives, we just accept as normal, because none of us appreciate the water that we swim in.
[01:06:18.283 --> 01:06:19.204]  This is our reality.
[01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:20.224]  So we say, oh, it's just normal.
[01:06:20.244 --> 01:06:23.147]  Yeah, big business, shareholders, we don't do the research if it's not cost effective.
[01:06:23.367 --> 01:06:24.628]  We've grown up on that.
[01:06:24.808 --> 01:06:30.372]  But it's a problem when you present it as medically effective, socially responsible, personally necessary.
[01:06:30.552 --> 01:06:45.803]  There are many, many questions that are left unanswered, and not questions that are going to be asked by Klaus Schwab at the bloody Davos WF Puff Piece Factory, that's primary intention, it seems to me, is to create a globalist technocracy, limit your individual power, your community, collective, and even national power.
[01:06:46.428 --> 01:06:53.437]  You know, if you just joined us, the last caller brought up how he wore an Alex Jones was right shirt and the adventure of the evening and how insane it was.
[01:06:54.398 --> 01:06:58.524]  And when I tell you that putting one of these shirts on is an adventure, I'm not just saying that.
[01:06:59.165 --> 01:07:02.409]  It will let you know how awake humanity is in your area.
[01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:04.572]  You could wear one in Portland.
[01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:07.187]  You'll get more support than you get negative.
[01:07:07.187 --> 01:07:11.187]   You can wear one in red areas and people will be carrying you around on their shoulders.
[01:07:11.187 --> 01:07:17.187]   And it just shows how awake people are and how weak the globalists are and how we can win together
[01:07:17.187 --> 01:07:23.187]   if we just stand up and don't have fear of man, as an earlier caller said, and tell the truth
[01:07:23.187 --> 01:07:25.187]  and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:07:25.187 --> 01:07:29.187]  Okay, let's go to the calls and the order they are received.
[01:07:29.187 --> 01:07:31.187]  Let's talk to Joe in Nebraska.
[01:07:31.187 --> 01:07:33.187]  Joe, thanks for calling.
[01:07:33.187 --> 01:07:35.187]  Hello.
[01:07:35.187 --> 01:07:37.187]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:47.187]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:07:38.215 --> 01:07:41.678]  Alright, good afternoon, and you're doing God's work, so thank you.
[01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:42.478]  I'll keep this short.
[01:07:42.538 --> 01:07:44.380]  I'll make my point and let you answer.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.301]  I've got three things.
[01:07:47.202 --> 01:07:51.525]  In my mind, it's hard to answer your question because they're all important, but justice.
[01:07:51.805 --> 01:07:55.828]  We need to get rid of the DAs, the FBI that's not doing its job.
[01:07:55.868 --> 01:08:02.633]  I think if these people had a fear of prosecution, they wouldn't keep doing the things like, you know, spraying chemicals on us and releasing things.
[01:08:03.658 --> 01:08:05.239]  I think number two might be the media.
[01:08:05.259 --> 01:08:08.741]  We need to do like we did with the big oil and the phone companies years ago.
[01:08:08.761 --> 01:08:10.322]  We need to break up the big media.
[01:08:10.823 --> 01:08:13.865]  We need to bring back the truth in advertising rules.
[01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:17.327]  And number three, I think we need to deal with the education.
[01:08:17.347 --> 01:08:23.571]  I think we need to, you know, get God back in schools, common sense, teach the truth, not just propaganda.
[01:08:24.511 --> 01:08:30.215]  Whether one or all of these three are on the top of the list, I don't know.
[01:08:30.275 --> 01:08:38.828]   But in my mind, I think if we don't get the The rules and laws we have enforced and they're going to get worse and keep doing what they're doing.
[01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:50.188]  That's why I love taking calls, because I laid out open borders, collapsing currency, pedophilia, poison shots, devaluation of currency, starting wars.
[01:08:50.729 --> 01:09:02.380]  But at the end of the day, we have a Praetorian Guard that protects the corrupt deep state that is the Justice Department that persecutes the innocent and defends and protects the corrupt.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:09.503]   And so that really is the big issue, that we have a captured government with a deep state and that's why they're able to do
[01:09:09.503 --> 01:09:14.193]   everything else they do because they've captured the American Empire. So what you
[01:09:14.193 --> 01:09:18.983]   said out of all the issues is really the answer. I didn't think of that and you're
[01:09:18.983 --> 01:09:22.184]   absolutely right. And the other two points you made restate those
[01:09:22.184 --> 01:09:28.302]   again. Education, they're rain washing our children and then what was the other one?
[01:09:28.302 --> 01:09:34.863]   The education might take you know seven years like what the Stalin said but the
[01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:36.662]  media...
[01:09:34.872 --> 01:09:38.953]  If we don't break up the monopolies of what, poor people?
[01:09:38.973 --> 01:09:39.314]  You're right.
[01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:47.976]  We need trust busting, we need to end monopolies, take control of education, and we need to take control of the federal government and the deep state apparatchiks.
[01:09:48.076 --> 01:09:49.617]  Beautifully said, God bless you Joe.
[01:09:50.377 --> 01:09:51.417]  Powerful call.
[01:09:52.558 --> 01:09:54.018]  And again, I think I'm pretty smart.
[01:09:55.538 --> 01:09:58.619]  And I say, here's what I think the big issues are, what do you think?
[01:09:58.919 --> 01:10:00.380]  And he calls in and I totally agree with him.
[01:10:01.493 --> 01:10:04.154]  Because all those other things are a symptom of a captured government.
[01:10:04.774 --> 01:10:05.314]  Bingo!
[01:10:05.774 --> 01:10:07.235]  Bingo, bingo, bingo!
[01:10:07.775 --> 01:10:09.976]  Digital Dave in Wisconsin.
[01:10:09.996 --> 01:10:10.976]  Digital Dave, go ahead.
[01:10:12.056 --> 01:10:12.997]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:10:13.057 --> 01:10:15.457]  God bless you and yours, my brother.
[01:10:15.937 --> 01:10:25.360]  My beloved wife and family and I are all praying for you and all of your family members and all InfoWars talented and anointed staff and all of the InfoWarriors out there.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:28.481]  I'll get right to my point, but let's say a quick prayer here.
[01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:38.421]   Father God, we are grateful and thankful And your hope, you tell us to be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving.
[01:10:39.062 --> 01:10:53.270]  Let our request be known to you, God, and then the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus, because you have not given us a spirit of fear, Lord, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.
[01:10:54.210 --> 01:11:02.534]  Alex, thank you for allowing us to be part of the InfoWars broadcast in a sympathetical relationship by making product resources available to us.
[01:11:02.694 --> 01:11:03.694]  I mean, that's really great.
[01:11:04.154 --> 01:11:06.095]  I mean, we got the coins, videos, products.
[01:11:07.073 --> 01:11:09.716]  Even the masks, you know, and everything is super high quality.
[01:11:09.756 --> 01:11:19.304]  Let me tell you, Soros and the Democrats have thrown hundreds of millions against you and I, and you have stood with us like a storm wall around a city.
[01:11:19.324 --> 01:11:32.595]  I mean, all I can say is thank you for staying in the fight, because it's been, and now the fight is so important, because we know we were right, and we know the world's waking up, and now we're reaching that critical 12th round.
[01:11:33.524 --> 01:11:34.064]  Absolutely.
[01:11:34.104 --> 01:11:40.587]  We have a much longer history than what you know, back to your beginnings and what left it to us.
[01:11:40.647 --> 01:11:44.908]  I mean, they removed all of our websites and everything from all stuff.
[01:11:44.928 --> 01:11:45.429]  We've got over 105.
[01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:51.451]  I'd like to put your ads on our sites, though I have to talk to you about that later.
[01:11:51.811 --> 01:12:03.577]   Here's why my priority one To defeat the demonic New World Order, Luciferian despots, is the vaccine, because everything is tied to the vaccine.
[01:12:04.818 --> 01:12:13.402]  Reasons, there are a lot of reasons, you know, to use the vaccine because there's so much, and like I said, everything is tied to it.
[01:12:13.742 --> 01:12:16.223]  The kids in school, the media, everything.
[01:12:16.884 --> 01:12:38.990]   The reason of using the vaccine is because there is so much going on in media From reputable source creators, reputable medical sources, and it should be easier to call out these people if we can prove it.
[01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:58.379]   Now, people have a natural propensity to be in the dark, so proving to the masses that the Vax is deadly I'm calling out those supporters in a who, what, when, where, why, and how situation.
[01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.880]  It should always be the tip of our tongue.
[01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:04.041]  We should have the names of the people involved.
[01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:11.923]  I mean, I know personally that these inbred freaks are weak, but they have money in NATO, and we all know that.
[01:13:12.543 --> 01:13:30.874]   And if we post important information, we can tie every one of the people from Klaus Schwab to Bill Gates You know, governors and senators, write to this and get our nation back.
[01:13:30.914 --> 01:13:40.877]  But it's going to require work and a plan, and the people have to individually create that plan, and don't do it without prayer first.
[01:13:41.317 --> 01:13:42.498]  Start with prayer.
[01:13:42.598 --> 01:13:49.920]  Listen, they're killing 170 people to save one person, Steve Kirsch said in one of Greece's great videos.
[01:13:50.583 --> 01:13:55.645]  So what we can do, I think, is get a list of names of all the Davos attendees.
[01:13:55.665 --> 01:14:00.347]  It might not be that easy, but I think we could do it, and share it with everyone.
[01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:01.547]  Well, that's happening.
[01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:03.148]  We're panicking all over the corporate media.
[01:14:03.168 --> 01:14:05.709]  The people are looking at Davos, the Davos alumni.
[01:14:05.749 --> 01:14:06.389]  Powerful points.
[01:14:06.429 --> 01:14:07.709]  Thank you, Digital Dave.
[01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:13.352]  We've got Derek up next on the other side, and then Mike in New York.
[01:14:13.432 --> 01:14:13.972]  Stay with us.
[01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:15.732]  Infowars.com.
[01:14:15.792 --> 01:14:16.953]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:14:16.973 --> 01:14:18.754]  At least this year.
[01:14:18.774 --> 01:14:19.754]  We do need more money.
[01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:24.256]  But we don't just need more money for vaccines for children eventually.
[01:14:24.817 --> 01:14:27.199]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic.
[01:14:27.239 --> 01:14:28.580]  There's going to be another pandemic.
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.061]  We have to think ahead.
[01:14:30.782 --> 01:14:33.184]  And that's not something the last outfit did very well.
[01:14:33.464 --> 01:14:35.305]  That's something we've been doing fairly well.
[01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:36.626]  That's why we need the money.
[01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:37.587]  Thank you.
[01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:38.788]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:40.650]  The story you're about to see is truth.
[01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:42.191]  This is reality.
[01:14:42.571 --> 01:14:44.453]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:49.552]  I'm the most banned, most demonized media person in the world.
[01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:50.934]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:14:50.974 --> 01:14:52.175]  He's a performance artist.
[01:14:52.235 --> 01:14:55.017]  I'm perceived as a clown, a nut, a maniac.
[01:14:56.358 --> 01:15:00.441]  On his website, InfoWars, he touts paranoia porn.
[01:15:01.142 --> 01:15:03.484]  The sickest, most offensive theories.
[01:15:04.064 --> 01:15:09.529]  Alex Jones claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:11.110]  Don't you stand for America, sir?
[01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:13.312]  He said me and Hillary are demons.
[01:15:15.353 --> 01:15:17.154]  Ain't that something?
[01:15:17.194 --> 01:15:19.215]  You'll burn in hell!
[01:15:19.335 --> 01:15:20.336]  I met him back in 1990.
[01:15:20.436 --> 01:15:22.497]  I knew right away he was gonna be a star.
[01:15:22.957 --> 01:15:23.438]  How's my hair look?
[01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:26.579]  I saw all these conspiracy terrorists that were talking about the New World Order.
[01:15:26.599 --> 01:15:27.860]  And I thought, that's what I'll do.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:28.901]  Get it, Alex.
[01:15:28.921 --> 01:15:31.122]  Death to the New World Order!
[01:15:31.142 --> 01:15:35.344]  It was that attack on humanity that I saw early on that I really wanted to wage war on.
[01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.405]  You're lying to the public.
[01:15:36.525 --> 01:15:37.286]  It's disgusting.
[01:15:37.326 --> 01:15:38.166]  Well, she'd taste that.
[01:15:38.666 --> 01:15:39.567]  There's no going back.
[01:15:42.003 --> 01:15:42.744]  Everything's a war.
[01:15:42.924 --> 01:15:45.706]  That's the way the universe works, and everything is propagated.
[01:15:46.246 --> 01:15:50.910]  I don't trust Donald Trump, but I agree with probably 95% of what Donald Trump says.
[01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:52.711]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:15:53.171 --> 01:15:54.532]  I will not let you down.
[01:15:55.914 --> 01:15:57.415]  That's what the media loves all.
[01:15:58.476 --> 01:16:03.184]  Alex Jones said the Sandy Hook shooting, which claimed the lives of 20 children, was fake.
[01:16:03.424 --> 01:16:05.527]  I try to tell the truth and sometimes I'm wrong.
[01:16:05.808 --> 01:16:12.238]  Did the New York Times get in trouble for consciously lying about WMDs that then led to a war that killed tens of thousands in conflict?
[01:16:12.278 --> 01:16:12.378]  No.
[01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:15.756]  The attempts to de-platform us have failed.
[01:16:15.976 --> 01:16:18.417]  They have the CIA, the FBI following me around.
[01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.217]  Now we gotta destroy Alex Jones.
[01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:21.438]  We're not playing games here.
[01:16:21.618 --> 01:16:25.059]  This is such a historic moment together!
[01:16:25.079 --> 01:16:25.879]  USA!
[01:16:26.279 --> 01:16:27.439]  USA!
[01:16:27.499 --> 01:16:28.740]  It's all just insane.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.541]  Okay, let's put me in prison for questioning, okay?
[01:16:31.561 --> 01:16:32.301]  Even though that's my right.
[01:16:32.581 --> 01:16:34.062]  In fact, let's execute Alex Jones.
[01:16:34.242 --> 01:16:38.363]  Let's put me in front of a firing squad, pull the trigger.
[01:16:38.423 --> 01:16:39.743]  I have a sick feeling, actually.
[01:16:40.043 --> 01:16:42.043]  Because I know what comes next.
[01:16:42.043 --> 01:16:50.043]  That's Alex's war film coming out in late July.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.500]  It's going to be in movie theaters, you name it.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.201]  All right, we're taking phone calls right now.
[01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:55.881]  I appreciate all of you patiently holding.
[01:16:56.401 --> 01:16:57.862]  Let's talk to Mike in New York.
[01:16:57.942 --> 01:16:58.622]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:16:58.662 --> 01:16:59.062]  Go ahead.
[01:17:00.642 --> 01:17:02.043]  Hey, thank you for taking the call.
[01:17:02.823 --> 01:17:10.705]  If you could just deal with the background noise, I'm actually outside in Manhattan, half a block away from the United Nations.
[01:17:12.425 --> 01:17:29.337]   And just wanted to say one of the things Most important stuff that we can do is continue to spread the word, listen to InfoWars, spread the word, share videos, support you guys, and just try to keep breaking through to your friends and family.
[01:17:30.038 --> 01:17:36.223]  It may take a lot of effort, may not feel like it's gotten anywhere, but we have to break through over the past six months.
[01:17:36.803 --> 01:17:44.630]  I've gotten through to some people that would have never, ever listened to this stuff, and it does cause the chain reaction, as you always say.
[01:17:45.573 --> 01:17:57.939]  And just a reminder that I think I heard it here, but at no other point in human history have we ever had as many people awake to the scam as we do right now.
[01:17:58.379 --> 01:18:06.463]  There are more people on Earth right now aware of what's going on, and all it takes is more spreading the word and sharing the information.
[01:18:07.203 --> 01:18:18.598]   And the biggest thing that I think we need to do is get the people in positions of power and authority, police officers, People that can, the people that are actually following the orders.
[01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.039]  Never the order givers that are doing the damage.
[01:18:22.419 --> 01:18:33.823]  It's the order followers who are actually injecting the vaccines, locking people up, stopping people from, you know, using their First Amendment rights and freedom of speech.
[01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:44.806]  It's the police officers, the ones that follow the orders, not just police officers, but, you know, people in positions of authority that just say, I'm just doing my job and I'm just doing that.
[01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:51.324]  Without them, these people don't have anybody to carry out their evil dictates and their evil stuff.
[01:18:51.404 --> 01:18:56.726]  It's getting to the people that actually are the ones that are doing the subjugation.
[01:18:57.186 --> 01:18:58.826]  The people following the orders of the Minion.
[01:18:59.046 --> 01:19:01.467]  Those are the most important people to try to break through to.
[01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:02.908]  And just keep going.
[01:19:03.008 --> 01:19:03.788]  Just keep pushing.
[01:19:03.808 --> 01:19:07.169]  And, you know, spread the good word.
[01:19:08.184 --> 01:19:09.324]  I totally agree with you, Mike.
[01:19:09.524 --> 01:19:11.725]  And I mean, look, they got us all compartmentalized.
[01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:13.125]  They've got us all balkanized.
[01:19:13.605 --> 01:19:14.685]  Atomized is the term.
[01:19:15.406 --> 01:19:16.446]  And it's just going to get worse.
[01:19:16.506 --> 01:19:20.847]  I mean, I've got stacks of news how they're destroying the economy, how they're coming after beef.
[01:19:20.947 --> 01:19:22.947]  We knew they would do it, but now they've announced how they're going to do it.
[01:19:23.307 --> 01:19:24.467]  Carbon taxes on the beef.
[01:19:25.148 --> 01:19:25.948]  We knew it was coming.
[01:19:26.068 --> 01:19:27.068]  It's all here.
[01:19:27.188 --> 01:19:31.289]  And it's just going to get worse and worse and worse until we wake up to it.
[01:19:31.649 --> 01:19:32.149]  It's that simple.
[01:19:33.444 --> 01:19:39.048]  Yep, and I mean, look at, you know, who's flying the plane dropping chemtrails on top of us?
[01:19:39.529 --> 01:19:41.931]  I mean, it's the people that are actually doing the work.
[01:19:42.011 --> 01:19:46.094]  It's the pilot, it's the, you know, police officer, the soldier, the doctor.
[01:19:46.134 --> 01:19:53.380]  And that's why they're trying to move to robots and drones, so now humans will be completely cut out of it, and then they can do anything they want.
[01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:55.141]  That's why we've got them in check.
[01:19:55.521 --> 01:19:57.042]  We've got to take them to checkmate now.
[01:19:57.062 --> 01:19:58.964]  Have to keep pushing.
[01:19:59.611 --> 01:20:01.212]  Have to keep pushing and spreading the word.
[01:20:01.412 --> 01:20:01.873]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:20:01.893 --> 01:20:02.593]  And people are hungry.
[01:20:02.633 --> 01:20:03.294]  Anything else, Mike?
[01:20:04.274 --> 01:20:05.395]  No, no, just that's it.
[01:20:05.455 --> 01:20:05.996]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:20:06.036 --> 01:20:06.636]  I appreciate it.
[01:20:06.656 --> 01:20:07.096]  Welcome back.
[01:20:07.116 --> 01:20:08.177]  Appreciate you.
[01:20:08.217 --> 01:20:08.818]  God bless you.
[01:20:09.378 --> 01:20:11.820]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Derrick in Virginia.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.660]  Derrick, you're on the air.
[01:20:13.821 --> 01:20:14.762]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:15.262]  I'm all right.
[01:20:16.443 --> 01:20:19.285]  Hey, you know, I was wondering, I want to try to cover the list you had.
[01:20:19.325 --> 01:20:27.551]  You know, one thing I never heard nobody talk about on the show is that Trump's biggest mistake was not selecting Rudy Giuliani and his attorney general.
[01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:32.423]  If he would have selected Rudy Giuliani as his Attorney General, I don't believe we would have had Russia.
[01:20:32.763 --> 01:20:34.484]  I don't believe we would have had Ukraine.
[01:20:34.804 --> 01:20:39.305]  I don't believe we would have had so many cabinet members inside who turned on the President.
[01:20:39.766 --> 01:20:42.947]  And that's just something, that was his biggest mistake, I believe.
[01:20:43.027 --> 01:20:49.850]  And no one wants to say that or admit that, but personally, in my opinion, that was his gravest mistake that he made to this day.
[01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:51.150]  No, I agree.
[01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:55.652]  Giuliani would have made a lot better Attorney General than the other two he had.
[01:20:56.601 --> 01:21:03.145]  You know, man, when he was campaigning, man, you know, we thought that he was gonna pick Giuliani, and when he announced Sessions, man, I couldn't believe it.
[01:21:03.165 --> 01:21:15.474]  Neither could my wife, and we suffered gravely from that because whether Sessions was an insider or not, somebody got him to give up his post and recuse himself, and everything went downhill from there.
[01:21:15.494 --> 01:21:24.640]  But I wanted to ask you also, too, Alex, and I don't know if this is personal for you or not, but why don't you and Steve Bannon get together, man?
[01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:26.387]  They are after you.
[01:21:26.207 --> 01:21:31.336]   They are after Bannon. Listen, Steve Bannon has said a lot of nice things about me. I'm not in the middle of him and
[01:21:31.336 --> 01:21:35.976]   Rogers' fight. I stay out of that. I think Bannon does a lot of great work. I think Rogers does a lot of great work.
[01:21:35.976 --> 01:21:40.927]   I'm guessing that's why it is. But Bannon's people are like, "Oh, he wants you on. He wants you on." It never does. I've
[01:21:40.927 --> 01:21:45.606]   invited Bannon on here. You name it. So that's a question for Steve Bannon. The door's open for Steve Bannon on the
[01:21:45.606 --> 01:21:46.207]  show.
[01:21:46.207 --> 01:21:50.816]   Well, you know, I would like to ask him that too, if I could. But, you know, I just asked it because, man, you too,
[01:21:50.816 --> 01:21:54.207]   man. You are number one, Alex. And you are, man, not the temp of the spirit.
[01:21:54.794 --> 01:21:56.475]  You are the spear, man.
[01:21:56.815 --> 01:22:01.436]  Nobody is leading the charge, man, putting their life on the line like you are, man.
[01:22:01.476 --> 01:22:09.318]  You and Owen and the rest of your cast, your production, the fact that you produce your own commercials, man, it's amazing what you're doing, man.
[01:22:09.338 --> 01:22:16.043]   And I know that God is pushing you, man, because The evilest thing they're doing to us, in my mind, is the propaganda.
[01:22:16.443 --> 01:22:18.124]  That's why we need InfoWars.
[01:22:18.184 --> 01:22:23.207]  That's why we gotta have Alex Jones, Owen Schwoyer, all the guests that come on and contribute.
[01:22:23.367 --> 01:22:26.049]  The propaganda is killing us.
[01:22:26.429 --> 01:22:28.050]  I talked to my dad the other day.
[01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.952]  He over in the Dominican Republic right now.
[01:22:31.463 --> 01:22:34.504]  And nothing I tell him will get through.
[01:22:34.665 --> 01:22:39.787]  As a matter of fact, he told me it's nothing I can show him that would change his mind.
[01:22:40.027 --> 01:22:42.028]  I try to show him Infowars articles.
[01:22:42.268 --> 01:22:44.729]  I try to show him the 2000 mules.
[01:22:45.150 --> 01:22:50.292]  He has solely bought the propaganda 100 million percent.
[01:22:50.592 --> 01:22:56.294]  And all we could do is keep using the M4 War Man Battle Tank to keep breaking the armor, keep bringing the high-tech guns.
[01:22:56.314 --> 01:23:01.896]  So what do we, I mean, as everything implodes under Biden, what is the point your dad's going to wake up?
[01:23:01.916 --> 01:23:05.037]  Because I'm sure he's a good person, he just can't believe it's this bad.
[01:23:05.197 --> 01:23:08.178]  He's projecting his own goodness, I think, onto the system.
[01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:14.900]  I think you're right, man, because he take every shot, he take every booster, and I can't even believe he ain't fell out yet.
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:18.321]  Well, you know, I learned to stop arguing with him and learned to take his point.
[01:23:18.361 --> 01:23:21.875]   It's just that, man, We need a worldwide prayer.
[01:23:22.335 --> 01:23:30.517]  Just like when these entertainers died, the whole world so-called stopped spinning and everybody want to hold candles in prayer in London, Paris, France, Europe.
[01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.038]  We gotta have a worldwide call to God.
[01:23:33.058 --> 01:23:33.478]  That's right.
[01:23:33.538 --> 01:23:39.940]  We need a worldwide call to God and a focal point that we reject the Great Reset, the UN, transhumanism, the world government.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:40.820]  Beautifully said.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:41.440]  Thank you, Derek.
[01:23:41.881 --> 01:23:42.801]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:23:42.821 --> 01:23:46.582]  We're going to start the next hour and take more calls in the order they're received.
[01:23:47.082 --> 01:23:48.102]  That would mean Joe.
[01:23:48.963 --> 01:23:49.843]  That would mean Noah.
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:51.561]  And that would mean everybody else.
[01:23:51.581 --> 01:23:53.082]  We're gonna get to all of you coming up.
[01:23:54.984 --> 01:23:56.965]  This is so important what we're doing right now, folks.
[01:23:57.005 --> 01:23:57.926]  The world is listening.
[01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:00.688]  We are one of the main focal points that they fear.
[01:24:01.088 --> 01:24:02.590]  And it's not because of InfoWars.
[01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:03.651]  It's because of all of you.
[01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:05.292]  Yes, the crew gets credit.
[01:24:05.312 --> 01:24:05.892]  I get some credit.
[01:24:05.912 --> 01:24:11.157]  But you have to understand, it's you and your word of mouth that overrides the AI, and they're so afraid of you.
[01:24:11.177 --> 01:24:12.638]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:16.034]  It's the most banned news network in the world.
[01:24:16.194 --> 01:24:19.158]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:24:19.198 --> 01:24:20.901]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:24:20.761 --> 01:24:29.761]  I'm Dr. Claire Craig.
[01:24:29.769 --> 01:24:32.911]  I'm a diagnostic pathologist and I'm co-chair of the Heart Group.
[01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:41.416]  And I want to take you through the evidence that Pfizer just presented to the FDA on the six-month to four-year-old children.
[01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:46.619]  There's an awful lot about this trial that has shocked me and I think will shock you too.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.120]  The trial recruited 4,526 children.
[01:24:51.222 --> 01:24:54.723]  Age from six months to four years old.
[01:24:54.743 --> 01:24:57.863]  3,000 of these children did not make it to the end of the trial.
[01:24:58.283 --> 01:25:00.044]  That is a huge number.
[01:25:00.404 --> 01:25:01.444]  Two-thirds of them.
[01:25:01.664 --> 01:25:03.504]  Why was there this drop-off?
[01:25:03.524 --> 01:25:04.644]  That needs to be answered.
[01:25:04.824 --> 01:25:09.465]  And without an answer to that, on that basis alone, this trial should be deemed null and void.
[01:25:09.845 --> 01:25:11.225]  So what did the trial show?
[01:25:11.526 --> 01:25:19.067]  Well, they defined severe COVID as children who had a slightly raised heart rate or a few more breaths per minute.
[01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:27.394]   There were six Children aged two to four who had severe COVID in the vaccine group, but only one in the placebo group.
[01:25:28.075 --> 01:25:35.763]  So on that basis, the likelihood that this vaccine is actually causing severe COVID is higher than the likelihood that it isn't.
[01:25:36.283 --> 01:25:39.447]  There was actually one child who was hospitalized in this trial.
[01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:41.569]  They had a fever and a seizure.
[01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:43.502]  They had been vaccinated.
[01:25:44.062 --> 01:25:47.445]  So now let's turn to what they defined as any COVID.
[01:25:47.865 --> 01:25:51.008]  And what they did was to utterly twist the data.
[01:25:51.912 --> 01:25:57.694]  They vaccinated the children and they waited three weeks after the first dose before the second dose.
[01:25:58.254 --> 01:26:13.259]  In that three-week period, 34 of the vaccinated children got COVID and only 13 in the placebo group, which worked out as a 30% increased chance of catching COVID in that three-week period if you were vaccinated.
[01:26:13.579 --> 01:26:14.640]  So they ignored that data.
[01:26:15.734 --> 01:26:24.059]  And then there was an eight-week gap between the second dose and the third dose, where again, children were getting plenty of COVID in the vaccine arm, so they ignored that data.
[01:26:24.759 --> 01:26:34.185]  There was then seven weeks after the third dose, which they also ignored, which meant that in the end, they had ignored 97% of the COVID that occurred during the trial.
[01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:37.967]  And they just looked at tiny numbers, so tiny.
[01:26:38.107 --> 01:26:44.771]  In the end, they were comparing three children in the vaccine arm who had COVID with seven in the placebo arm.
[01:26:45.232 --> 01:26:47.686]  And they said that this showed the vaccine was effective.
[01:26:48.129 --> 01:26:52.212]  There are more allergic reactions to the COVID vaccines than first expected.
[01:26:52.672 --> 01:26:56.695]  Headaches, nausea, hallucinations, and yes, even death.
[01:26:57.115 --> 01:26:58.736]  I've lost count of the injuries.
[01:26:58.876 --> 01:27:09.363]  Things like urinating clots of blood, paresthesias, gastroparesis, altered mental status, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, new onset diabetes.
[01:27:09.984 --> 01:27:12.185]  I have patients who can't walk anymore.
[01:27:13.086 --> 01:27:16.188]  I've just never seen anything like this in all my years of practicing medicine.
[01:27:17.913 --> 01:27:29.296]  These people are creating a whole conspiracy theory and they are trying to basically benefit and profit from this fear of the people.
[01:27:29.696 --> 01:27:30.977]  And this is who are the criminals.
[01:27:30.997 --> 01:27:33.657]  Those that they don't get the vaccine, they are people that are threat.
[01:27:33.918 --> 01:27:38.359]  The people that are circulating all this misinformation, they are criminals.
[01:27:39.239 --> 01:27:50.841]   Get your DVD copy of COVID Land 3 The Shot at Infowarsstore.com Oh, no, no, no.
[01:27:50.861 --> 01:27:51.701]  I don't even know what this is.
[01:27:51.761 --> 01:27:52.402]  How did you get here?
[01:27:53.762 --> 01:27:55.842]  I just caught you, American.
[01:27:56.162 --> 01:27:58.243]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:27:59.143 --> 01:28:02.384]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:28:02.744 --> 01:28:09.744]   Do what CNN says and do not visit me in the video or I have to hurt you.
[01:28:09.744 --> 01:28:19.744]  [Music]
[01:28:19.744 --> 01:28:28.144]   America is already suffering a food shortage, which can be felt by rising costs and emptying shelves at the grocery
[01:28:28.144 --> 01:28:28.744]  store.
[01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:29.986]  But this is a cakewalk.
[01:28:30.486 --> 01:28:31.747]  It's going to get much worse.
[01:28:32.567 --> 01:28:35.089]  The writing, as they say, is on the wall.
[01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:40.939]  Any reasonable person can see that this is all being done deliberately.
[01:28:41.919 --> 01:28:48.325]  Over 10,000 cattle just died, and we are told that it was due to 100-degree weather.
[01:28:49.346 --> 01:28:57.413]  And in just the past 17 months, nearly 100 disasters have mysteriously befallen the American food industry.
[01:28:58.133 --> 01:29:02.376]  Dozens of catastrophic fires burning down food processing plants.
[01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:07.180]  In multiple cases, caused by small aircraft crashing into them.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:10.142]  Thousands of tons of meat destroyed.
[01:29:10.863 --> 01:29:13.444]  Over 2 million turkeys have been destroyed.
[01:29:14.025 --> 01:29:16.827]  Over 40 million chickens have been destroyed.
[01:29:17.467 --> 01:29:22.131]  And with the rising cost of fuel, farmers are unable to harvest their crops.
[01:29:23.593 --> 01:29:25.395]  And it's only just beginning.
[01:29:26.396 --> 01:29:31.161]  Remember, Joe Biden promised he would shut down oil and gas.
[01:29:32.099 --> 01:29:33.260]  I have one final question.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.141]  Would he close down the oil industry?
[01:29:35.201 --> 01:29:36.281]  Would you close down the oil industry?
[01:29:36.301 --> 01:29:38.883]  On the way, I would transition from the oil industry, yes.
[01:29:39.643 --> 01:29:41.204]  Oh, that's a big statement.
[01:29:41.224 --> 01:29:42.064]  It is a big statement.
[01:29:42.104 --> 01:29:42.684]  That's a big statement.
[01:29:42.704 --> 01:29:43.585]  Because I would stop.
[01:29:43.765 --> 01:29:44.505]  Why would you do that?
[01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:48.287]  Because the oil industry pollutes significantly.
[01:29:48.608 --> 01:29:48.768]  I see.
[01:29:48.788 --> 01:29:49.488]  And here's the deal.
[01:29:49.508 --> 01:29:50.048]  But you can't do that.
[01:29:50.068 --> 01:29:50.609]  That's a big statement.
[01:29:51.009 --> 01:29:56.772]  Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time.
[01:29:57.472 --> 01:29:58.032]  Over time.
[01:29:58.313 --> 01:29:59.293]  That's the biggest statement.
[01:29:59.493 --> 01:30:04.236]  Because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry.
[01:30:04.697 --> 01:30:06.077]  Will you remember that, Texas?
[01:30:06.178 --> 01:30:08.339]  Will you remember that, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?
[01:30:08.359 --> 01:30:12.141]  Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question.
[01:30:12.301 --> 01:30:13.022]  Vice President Biden.
[01:30:13.766 --> 01:30:20.569]  He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions.
[01:30:21.429 --> 01:30:25.371]  But kiddo, I want you to just take a look, okay?
[01:30:25.391 --> 01:30:28.252]  You don't have to agree, but I want you to look in my eyes.
[01:30:29.492 --> 01:30:36.035]  I guarantee, I guarantee we're going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to cooperate.
[01:30:37.361 --> 01:30:43.405]  And they are making good with their radical promise, except there is no alternative energy plan.
[01:30:44.106 --> 01:30:50.050]  The Biden administration is doing everything they can to shut down all fossil fuel in this country.
[01:30:50.670 --> 01:30:59.136]  And not only will that stop people from driving, all public transportation, all shipping and all industry will come to a halt.
[01:30:59.676 --> 01:31:04.220]  Millions will lose their jobs and hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[01:31:05.419 --> 01:31:12.903]  Whether you like it or not, civilization is dependent upon oil and gas, and our government is turning it all off.
[01:31:14.984 --> 01:31:32.154]  We are also still suffering a baby formula shortage, and what little we do have is being sent to the open southern border for the tens of thousands of hungry foreigners being brought in unchecked and flown to already struggling cities across America.
[01:31:33.567 --> 01:31:46.537]  And after several countries suspended the Moderna vaccine for adults due to safety concerns, the United States FDA just unanimously voted to inject your infant children with the deadly shot.
[01:31:47.917 --> 01:31:57.242]  Your government is trying to kill you, and if anyone thinks this is hyperbole or fear-mongering, they are not paying attention, or they are in shock.
[01:31:58.382 --> 01:32:07.687]  The only solution we are being offered is to vote, even though we have a rigged election system and two parties that work for the same corporate establishment.
[01:32:09.005 --> 01:32:14.752]  Starvation is coming fast, and people can only survive a few weeks without food.
[01:32:15.453 --> 01:32:22.982]  And so, what exactly will we do if the so-called Red Wave this November fails to turn the tide?
[01:32:24.484 --> 01:32:27.684]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:32:27.684 --> 01:32:47.124]   We are back in hour number three in defiance of all the globalists, their wishes to shut us down.
[01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:49.772]  Thanks to you, we are still on air.
[01:32:50.233 --> 01:32:52.054]  Let's go to Noah in Chicago.
[01:32:52.194 --> 01:32:53.075]  Noah, you're on the air.
[01:32:53.095 --> 01:32:55.337]  Hi, can you hear me?
[01:32:55.517 --> 01:32:55.917]  Yes, sir.
[01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:11.049]  So when your question about how do we defeat the globalists, I think we have to start with love and not taking into account of where you come from or what state.
[01:33:11.844 --> 01:33:14.225]  Or Democratic or Republican.
[01:33:14.245 --> 01:33:15.726]  I don't think it's an issue of that.
[01:33:16.286 --> 01:33:22.609]  I think we need to unite and come together in order to defeat them.
[01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:31.854]  And I think that they push dividing us in school systems, at work, and on our media that they have bought out.
[01:33:35.233 --> 01:33:36.234]  I think you're totally right.
[01:33:37.175 --> 01:33:39.177]  We have to realize the enemy is a globalist.
[01:33:39.678 --> 01:33:49.728]  We can have our fights and differences later, but they're the main enemy attacking us with inflation, with division, with the corporate media, with everything they do.
[01:33:49.788 --> 01:33:50.148]  You're right.
[01:33:51.690 --> 01:34:04.106]   And one of the main issues that I'm dealing with, especially with our mayor in Chicago, is how they preach peace in one hand and then They promote violence in their own city and then not allow the police to do their job correctly.
[01:34:04.287 --> 01:34:05.867]  Talk about Lord Lightfoot.
[01:34:08.008 --> 01:34:08.249]  Yep.
[01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:11.990]  So where do you see it going, brother?
[01:34:13.651 --> 01:34:15.072]  Um, I don't know.
[01:34:15.772 --> 01:34:18.954]  It's hard to look at all the different issues that are going on.
[01:34:19.854 --> 01:34:33.267]   And when I'm finding out now at 22 about how my entire life, the majority of things That I learned was incorrect and that I was born into this after 9-11.
[01:34:33.367 --> 01:34:39.090]  So we already started to give up our rights and allow them to infringe on those things.
[01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:40.991]  That's right, it's all slave training.
[01:34:41.351 --> 01:34:51.597]  The border is completely wide open, but the TSA searches everything you've got like you're a terrorist, and now they want a world ID and a forced vaccination to take over your body.
[01:34:51.777 --> 01:34:52.617]  Absolutely right.
[01:34:52.938 --> 01:34:53.978]  Noah, thank you for the call.
[01:34:54.538 --> 01:34:56.459]  Let's talk to Carlos in Canada.
[01:34:56.479 --> 01:34:57.300]  Carlos, welcome.
[01:34:59.059 --> 01:34:59.679]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.900]  A pleasure talking to you again.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.500]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:14.544]  Alex, we are in inversion when a person like Hunter Biden and another person like Julian Assange, one walks the streets and the other one is in prison.
[01:35:16.805 --> 01:35:27.548]  I think it's important that if we look at the problem, the problem of globalism seems to have been more concentrated in the United States and Europe than other areas.
[01:35:28.095 --> 01:35:30.217]  Latin America, there's an awakening to that.
[01:35:30.317 --> 01:35:33.500]  And in Europe, there isn't.
[01:35:33.881 --> 01:35:40.767]  There is an awakening in Russia, in China, etc., against this globalist agenda that is destroying the United States.
[01:35:41.648 --> 01:35:46.452]  Ask yourself for a second, why is Merrick Garland in Ukraine?
[01:35:47.574 --> 01:35:49.095]  Ukraine is not a NATO nation.
[01:35:49.615 --> 01:35:51.878]  Ukraine is not a member of the European Union.
[01:35:52.258 --> 01:35:53.179]  What's he doing there?
[01:35:54.051 --> 01:36:09.243]  What jurisdiction does he have when, in reality, you've got January 6th people in prison, essentially, without due process, other than, you know, all sorts of political manipulation?
[01:36:10.184 --> 01:36:17.309]  I think the issue is one that we're in an inversion, and we have to think out of the box, Alex, to get out of the inversion.
[01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:22.974]  There was an inversion a long, long time ago when Barabbas walked and Jesus got crucified.
[01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:42.438]  You have to understand that we're in that same type of inversion, that it requires a new conceptual way of thinking, that we have to understand that the World Economic Forum is a glorified chamber of commerce, where they have members who move 20 trillion dollars, and they have a lot of power.
[01:36:43.078 --> 01:36:50.705]  But, you know, the issue is that neither the Constitution of the United States has been changed, neither has the Constitution of many of these countries.
[01:36:51.075 --> 01:36:57.200]  These people are manipulating smoke and mirrors, Alex, and we have to simply look at them for what they are.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:00.262]  Now, other countries are simply saying, we don't want any part of you.
[01:37:00.323 --> 01:37:01.543]  We don't want to obey.
[01:37:02.044 --> 01:37:04.446]  We have Governor DeSantis saying the same thing.
[01:37:04.486 --> 01:37:06.007]  Who are these people to tell us what to do?
[01:37:06.568 --> 01:37:15.275]  I think that's the attitude that we should take, is to examine each individual and to turn the weapon that they use against you against them.
[01:37:16.055 --> 01:37:17.216]  Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:37:17.556 --> 01:37:18.217]  Analyze that.
[01:37:18.257 --> 01:37:20.639]  I've done a study on this thinking.
[01:37:21.138 --> 01:37:22.739]  And it is absolutely wrong.
[01:37:22.999 --> 01:37:29.283]  If you use that kind of analysis, you actually show the World Economic Forum fallacy for what it is.
[01:37:29.363 --> 01:37:30.184]  Smokes and mirrors.
[01:37:32.926 --> 01:37:33.386]  You're right.
[01:37:33.446 --> 01:37:40.151]  These are complete authoritarian psychopaths creating a system where the criminals can rule over us and good people are punished.
[01:37:40.171 --> 01:37:40.871]  Thank you, Carlos.
[01:37:41.431 --> 01:37:43.072]  All right, let's go to a call in New Jersey.
[01:37:43.773 --> 01:37:45.114]  Let's talk to Joe in New Jersey.
[01:37:45.154 --> 01:37:45.734]  Joe, go ahead.
[01:37:45.754 --> 01:37:48.976]  Alex, can you hear me?
[01:37:49.156 --> 01:37:49.477]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:49.497 --> 01:37:49.737]  Go ahead.
[01:37:50.953 --> 01:37:52.394]  Thank you for all your sacrifice, man.
[01:37:52.434 --> 01:37:53.335]  I really appreciate it.
[01:37:54.055 --> 01:37:54.756]  It's well worth it.
[01:37:54.776 --> 01:37:55.797]  Just keep me in the five, brother.
[01:37:57.138 --> 01:37:59.119]  Hey, I had to say it.
[01:37:59.159 --> 01:38:04.424]  There was a New York Times article yesterday titled, Citing Disastrous Pandemic Response.
[01:38:04.524 --> 01:38:09.087]  An Expert Bipartisan Panel Calls for the Complete Overhaul of the U.S.
[01:38:09.127 --> 01:38:10.108]  Public Health System.
[01:38:10.548 --> 01:38:13.591]  They want an all-of-government approach to public health.
[01:38:14.111 --> 01:38:26.979]  There's a lot of things going on and a lot of people touched on this, but I think the absolute top priority and core goal of these globalists is the full attack, destabilization, and seizure of control over these public health systems around the world.
[01:38:27.399 --> 01:38:34.683]  They want the full autonomy to create a crisis and to use it to install whatever protocol they want without any limit or objection.
[01:38:34.903 --> 01:38:51.324]   This panel that spoke yesterday is consisted of FDA commissioners, CDC directors, HHS leaders, All of which are tied to the World Health Organization shortly after you had Biden out there asking for money and talking about the next pandemic.
[01:38:51.344 --> 01:38:54.749]  I can't definitively say that's related, but the timing is pretty suspicious.
[01:38:55.982 --> 01:39:10.469]  After that World Health Organization treaty failed, despite like 200 countries signing it, including the U.S., it seems like they're moving into this next option, which is splitting the script and painting the whole COVID response as a failure of the public system that currently exists.
[01:39:11.009 --> 01:39:12.029]  They want to bring in a new virus.
[01:39:12.049 --> 01:39:12.289]  That's right.
[01:39:12.349 --> 01:39:22.434]  They create the virus, they release it, they block therapeutics, they poison the public, then they call it a failure, and they've had even more control for the next coming pandemic that Biden's been talking about.
[01:39:23.462 --> 01:39:24.723]  Yeah, that's all the same people.
[01:39:24.783 --> 01:39:34.691]  They ride the momentum in any direction they can straight to the same goal, which is an expanded government health authority with the goal of creating baseline protocol, their own regulations.
[01:39:35.112 --> 01:39:41.557]  And then you've got a large part of the general public that's in Stockholm Syndrome believing it's the system trying to help them.
[01:39:42.867 --> 01:39:56.256]  Right, and this plan, they flat-out stated in this New York Times article that they want this power to supersede patchwork over all of the 3,000 state, local, tribal authorities in the United States.
[01:39:56.777 --> 01:39:57.157]  No limit.
[01:39:57.577 --> 01:39:58.538]  They want it installed digitally.
[01:39:58.558 --> 01:40:01.260]  Yeah, and that's beyond a federal takeover.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.182]  It's a global government takeover to end jurisdiction.
[01:40:04.502 --> 01:40:04.802]  That's it.
[01:40:04.842 --> 01:40:08.625]  It's a global government biomedical takeover happening now.
[01:40:09.850 --> 01:40:22.161]  And the best part is the people that are brainchilding this, this Commonwealth Fund, it's a hundred year old company, you know, funds, merger, all of these same corporate interests.
[01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:24.163]  These people just move into it.
[01:40:24.564 --> 01:40:26.225]  It's all from the same globalist money.
[01:40:26.245 --> 01:40:31.470]  The founder was a woman who married a Rockefeller investor when she was 16 years old.
[01:40:33.523 --> 01:40:34.924]  You can't even make it up.
[01:40:34.964 --> 01:40:38.465]  These people are all tied together and they want unlimited authority.
[01:40:38.505 --> 01:40:42.787]  They want to consolidate all this power into one entity, into one person.
[01:40:43.028 --> 01:40:44.388]  And what is their ideology?
[01:40:44.408 --> 01:40:46.029]  Because the power they want is one thing.
[01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:54.453]  But they want the power for forced depopulation, the power over every human's body, literal biological rape.
[01:40:56.058 --> 01:40:56.939]  God help us, Alex.
[01:40:57.279 --> 01:40:58.540]  Really appreciate the time, sir.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:40:59.701]  No, appreciate you.
[01:40:59.761 --> 01:41:00.281]  Thank you, Joe.
[01:41:00.942 --> 01:41:05.505]  All right, Leo Zagami is up next, and we got loaded phones after that.
[01:41:05.545 --> 01:41:07.306]  After he goes, I'll try to get to your calls.
[01:41:07.366 --> 01:41:08.327]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:41:08.767 --> 01:41:10.949]  Leo Zagami's taking over, but let me just say this real quick.
[01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:17.593]  The smartest thing I can say is you need to get storable food.
[01:41:18.714 --> 01:41:19.715]  It's an easy equation.
[01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:22.217]  We need to have funds to fund our operation.
[01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:25.058]  So what am I going to sell?
[01:41:25.338 --> 01:41:28.160]  High quality, storable food at a very low price, ready to ship.
[01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:37.703]  PrepareToday.com has high quality, storable food ready to ship to you right now.
[01:41:38.163 --> 01:41:42.485]  That's how you beat inflation because food prices are going up, the food shortages, all of it.

[01:41:59.898 --> 01:42:10.164]  And you are insane with what's happening with the economy and food shortages and the attacks on food processing plants and all the rest of it to not get prepared now and it supports a broadcast, a 360 win.
[01:42:10.184 --> 01:42:10.905]  Prepare today.com.
[01:42:14.733 --> 01:42:19.246]  Alright, I've known Leo Zegami for a long time.
[01:42:20.224 --> 01:42:24.863]   been on my show more than 10 years. But I gotta tell you, he's written best-selling books,
[01:42:24.863 --> 01:42:28.784]   he's covered it all, he gave us a tour of the Vatican, and so much more years ago when I was
[01:42:28.784 --> 01:42:33.663]   in Rome, Italy. And he predicted, he said, "Listen, they want to get rid of popes staying
[01:42:33.663 --> 01:42:38.384]   in their office until they die, and they want to start replacing them, then they're going to have
[01:42:38.384 --> 01:42:43.262]   a committee after that." And all of it's happened. He predicted the current pope, who's the head of
[01:42:43.262 --> 01:42:46.324]  the Jesuits, would be the pope, five years before he was.
[01:42:46.324 --> 01:42:51.583]   He predicted that he would step down. Now Now it's all in the news, he's getting ready to step down.
[01:42:52.586 --> 01:43:08.700]  Because even if you're not a Catholic, there's over a billion people on this planet that are, and we've seen this current Pope do the opposite of somebody like John Paul II, and you know, so many others that have been out there, and it's just a crazy time to be alive.
[01:43:09.882 --> 01:43:13.225]  So, what does all this really mean?
[01:43:13.825 --> 01:43:14.846]  What does this signify?
[01:43:14.866 --> 01:43:16.788]  And what does it mean with the current Pope?
[01:43:17.955 --> 01:43:24.439]  A month ago saying, NATO started the war, they should do a deal, this war should stop.
[01:43:24.959 --> 01:43:26.220]  What does that signify?
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.561]  I got almost no news coverage.
[01:43:27.881 --> 01:43:29.502]  There's a lot of pieces to this.
[01:43:30.142 --> 01:43:33.144]  Looking at the Great Reset, the New World Order, all these plans.
[01:43:33.604 --> 01:43:34.545]  Leo Zegami.
[01:43:35.743 --> 01:43:38.004]  Joins us for the Balance of the Hour.
[01:43:38.024 --> 01:43:38.764]  I appreciate him.
[01:43:38.804 --> 01:43:40.025]  LeoZagami.com.
[01:43:40.885 --> 01:43:47.068]  L-E-O-Z-A-G-A-M-I.com or at realleozagami on Gab.
[01:43:47.828 --> 01:43:50.049]  And he is here with us to lay this out.
[01:43:50.129 --> 01:43:52.330]  True Vatican, former Illuminati.
[01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:54.991]  Uh, whistleblower, insider.
[01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:57.192]  What a time to be alive, Leo.
[01:43:57.853 --> 01:43:59.313]  How you knew all this so many years.
[01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:00.774]  I knew you were 20 years ago.
[01:44:00.794 --> 01:44:02.695]  I was like, I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:44:02.715 --> 01:44:03.416]  Then it all came true.
[01:44:03.436 --> 01:44:04.316]  That's why I've had you on.
[01:44:04.856 --> 01:44:05.837]  What a time to be alive.
[01:44:05.857 --> 01:44:07.738]  There's so many angles to cover here.
[01:44:09.125 --> 01:44:12.267]  Absolutely Alex, it was a pleasure to speak to you and to your audience.
[01:44:12.807 --> 01:44:16.489]  We are definitely facing a turning point in history.
[01:44:16.969 --> 01:44:32.177]  The Pope itself, like we said when I was with you in Rome, will become a figure that will start to become very far from his divine appointment.
[01:44:32.277 --> 01:44:48.227]   He's kind of like giving up On hope of staying there until the end of his mandate, it's pretty clear now that even Megyn Kelly, I mean I'm not talking about a big Vatican expert and you of course know her too.
[01:44:48.987 --> 01:44:56.472]  So she came out while in Rome stating that there is something that is going on in the Vatican right now.
[01:44:56.952 --> 01:45:10.729]  And I can definitely confirm that they are preparing for the Pope to resign, but not before he appoints the last progressive cardinals that will define the next papacy.
[01:45:10.748 --> 01:45:15.108]  It's a little bit like the Supreme Court here in the US.
[01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:20.548]   If you have it filled with progressive members, it will act in a way.
[01:45:20.548 --> 01:45:23.268]  If you have it with Republicans, in another way.
[01:45:23.268 --> 01:45:32.228]   So he is being actually staying in his position only because Ratzinger is still there.
[01:45:32.228 --> 01:45:35.787]  And Ratzinger behind the scenes could still be a threat.
[01:45:35.787 --> 01:45:42.349]   That's why during the pandemic, he's been increasingly isolating the now former Pope.
[01:45:42.970 --> 01:45:45.370]  And in the meantime, he got sick.
[01:45:45.410 --> 01:45:49.471]  He got sick with colon cancer that got pretty bad last year.
[01:45:49.651 --> 01:45:58.153]  The Vatican has done everything possible to cover up the situation, which now sees really the Pope in a wheelchair.
[01:45:58.553 --> 01:46:05.735]  So it's pretty evident he had to also cancel a trip to Africa that he was planning for a long time.
[01:46:06.155 --> 01:46:15.338]  Which was also a way for him to introduce the next pontificate, which will be definitely in the hands of an African Pope.
[01:46:15.798 --> 01:46:17.839]  So this is what's going on in the Vatican.
[01:46:17.859 --> 01:46:31.863]  He's waiting August to nominate these other cardinals that he will need so he can basically program the next papacy in line with his own, and then he's going to resign.
[01:46:32.103 --> 01:46:40.566]  So there is not much left to this papacy that will probably end up in August, maximum in September.
[01:46:40.866 --> 01:46:51.330]  I know that we've been saying this before, that he will resign, but he has been resisting because he, of course, wanted to wait for the death of Ratzinger.
[01:46:51.489 --> 01:46:53.569]  But I think it is still there.
[01:46:53.569 --> 01:46:55.569]  So that's about it.
[01:46:55.569 --> 01:47:05.248]   He's resisting until on August 27th, he will be nominating 21 new cardinals, of which 16
[01:47:05.248 --> 01:47:11.489]   will be progressive-leaning cardinals under the age of 80 that will be eligible to vote
[01:47:11.489 --> 01:47:12.969]  in a future conclave.
[01:47:12.969 --> 01:47:15.688]  And that's about it, Alex.
[01:47:15.688 --> 01:47:20.569]   What do you make of him coming out, as you know, a month ago and saying, OK, NATO started
[01:47:20.569 --> 01:47:24.748]   the war, we need a peace deal with Russia. They got almost no coverage but he
[01:47:24.538 --> 01:47:26.937]  but he said that officially. What does that signify?
[01:47:26.937 --> 01:47:38.698]   Well, of course, behind the scenes, the Pope has really tried in some way to open a line of dialogue with the
[01:47:38.698 --> 01:47:44.498]   Orthodox leadership in Moscow, but that failed miserably. So at the moment, he's using the
[01:47:44.498 --> 01:47:52.257]   Knights of Malta that have a longstanding tradition in Russia for a direct line of communication with Putin.
[01:47:52.498 --> 01:47:58.217]   He really relies a lot on the Russians also for his own interest.
[01:47:58.217 --> 01:48:00.217]  But I'm talking about interest.
[01:48:00.217 --> 01:48:06.098]   I'm talking about tourism in Italy, in religious places is mainly Russian.
[01:48:06.198 --> 01:48:16.903]  So he's losing a lot of money, but he is also interested, of course, in siding with China, which, of course, behind the scenes also sides with Russia.
[01:48:16.963 --> 01:48:32.651]  So while he, of course, in front of the general public had to agree to sustain Ukraine, and he did it quite blatantly by showing even the flag of the ground forces of Ukraine.
[01:48:33.471 --> 01:48:36.533]  Pretty much in line with NATO.
[01:48:37.194 --> 01:48:39.115]  Behind the scenes things are different.
[01:48:39.135 --> 01:48:48.762]  There is actually a Pope that is part of an order, the Jesuits, that also have a very much long story with Russia.
[01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:58.525]   When the Jesuits were persecuted by the Vatican at one point, it seems strange now we have Jesuit Pope, they took refuge in Russia and was actually
[01:48:58.525 --> 01:49:02.864]   Catherine the Great that gave them refuge.
[01:49:02.864 --> 01:49:09.985]   So, he has definitely, he's trying behind the scenes to maintain this line of communication
[01:49:09.985 --> 01:49:19.265]   and the Knights of Malta also have undergone in the last few weeks a internal coup because
[01:49:19.265 --> 01:49:25.145]   the Pope nominated John T. Dunlap, a member of the Sovereign Council and Lieutenant now
[01:49:25.145 --> 01:49:31.385]   of the Grand Master, because there is no Grand Master at the moment in the Knights of Malta.
[01:49:31.374 --> 01:49:43.022]   And as you know, for the last few years, The Jesuits, who are traditionally controlling of everything, have tried also to take control of the sovereign order of the Knights of Malta.
[01:49:43.642 --> 01:49:53.969]  When I say sovereign, it's very important to underline sovereign, because they have their own sovereignty, which is separate from the Vatican, and even their own state, even if it's a micro-state.
[01:49:54.429 --> 01:50:00.553]  You remember when we were in Rome, at one point I brought you inside the headquarters of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre.
[01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:04.135]  That itself is also another micro-state.
[01:50:04.195 --> 01:50:11.599]  So these are states that are separate from the Italian jurisdiction and belong to these important knighthoods.
[01:50:11.659 --> 01:50:19.323]  Now, the Sovereign Order of Malta has a former royal who is still a prince.
[01:50:19.603 --> 01:50:20.944]  Stay there, Leo Zagami.
[01:50:21.004 --> 01:50:22.665]  Explain what this means geopolitically.
[01:50:22.705 --> 01:50:23.906]  This is big to the...
[01:50:24.486 --> 01:50:27.167]  A whole future of the world, and people aren't talking about it.
[01:50:27.227 --> 01:50:28.167]  Leo Zegami is our guest.
[01:50:28.187 --> 01:50:28.667]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:28.687 --> 01:50:29.087]  Stay with us.
[01:50:29.847 --> 01:50:38.750]  So there are big shakeups around the world happening right now, but what does it mean that this globalist pope is reportedly getting ready to step down?
[01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:43.251]  Leo Zegami, I can ask a lot of questions, but front and center, you were on a few years ago.
[01:50:44.251 --> 01:50:46.031]  You predicted the whole globalist agenda.
[01:50:46.051 --> 01:50:48.312]  Those videos have since gone viral.
[01:50:49.471 --> 01:50:51.693]  What are you predicting now is about to happen?
[01:50:52.253 --> 01:50:53.654]  How is the Great Reset going?
[01:50:53.714 --> 01:50:55.816]  Are they planning new pandemics, as Biden says?
[01:50:56.256 --> 01:50:57.337]  What do you think is coming next?
[01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.779]  And just cover the waterfront, anything you want to cover.
[01:50:59.799 --> 01:51:02.361]  Instead of my questions, give us the data dump, my friend.
[01:51:03.682 --> 01:51:04.382]  Okay, Alex.
[01:51:04.883 --> 01:51:19.814]   Well, first of all, as you know, this crisis will create a massive migration from Africa, for example, because of the grains and flowers that are no longer Coming from Ukraine.
[01:51:20.034 --> 01:51:24.038]  And for that reason, of course, the papacy will be centered.
[01:51:24.058 --> 01:51:28.402]  It will be focused on Africa with an African Pope.
[01:51:28.802 --> 01:51:32.565]  It's almost like they are preparing this whole thing.
[01:51:33.005 --> 01:51:41.152]  And at the same time, we have, of course, the escalation in the last couple of days regarding Kaliningrad.
[01:51:41.293 --> 01:51:43.775]  Kaliningrad is a small enclave.
[01:51:44.755 --> 01:51:52.097]  That used to be under the control a long time ago of the Teutonic Knights is on the Baltic Sea.
[01:51:52.237 --> 01:51:57.838]  It's Russia, but it's surrounded by NATO countries, by Lithuania, by Poland.
[01:51:58.318 --> 01:52:03.700]  And now they have stopped the import of goods from Russia by train.
[01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:11.982]  That is basically a violation for Russia of all treaties and it also forces Russia to intervene.
[01:52:12.682 --> 01:52:19.847]  The spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of Russia has just said that they will intervene basically militarily.
[01:52:20.208 --> 01:52:35.336]   That is of enormous gravity and I don't really know why most of the media today in America are not talking about it because we are literally facing Now, an even worse scenario than Ukraine, because Ukraine is not NATO.
[01:52:36.116 --> 01:52:38.577]  Instead, Lithuania is NATO.
[01:52:38.677 --> 01:52:44.078]  So that will be automatically America intervening in this war.
[01:52:44.538 --> 01:52:47.659]  And the consequences, of course, will be disastrous.
[01:52:48.059 --> 01:52:53.200]  The Pope behind the scene is trying diplomatically various moves.
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:53:03.003]  But they were rejected, like I said previously, by the Orthodox leadership, Patriarch Kirill, and so at the moment he's trying other ways.
[01:53:03.443 --> 01:53:18.067]  But there is a sense of desperation, almost, because there is also a prophecy that was said a long time ago, a prophecy, one of these Marian apparitions of the Holy Mary in Garam Bandal.
[01:53:18.547 --> 01:53:27.977]  And in these apparitions, they said the moment in which the Pope ever steps in Moscow, that will be the beginning of the end for mankind.
[01:53:28.257 --> 01:53:37.847]  And these visions are considered legitimate by saints of the Catholic Church, like Padre Pio, even Mother Teresa of Calcutta.
[01:53:38.087 --> 01:53:44.990]  So we are really facing some incredible times and we need to be ready.
[01:53:45.070 --> 01:53:50.493]  Like you said before I started my segment, storable food is essential.
[01:53:50.613 --> 01:53:55.135]  I have my own bucket from InfoWars right here.
[01:53:55.675 --> 01:54:13.560]  And I suggest everybody else to do the same, because we have to also be ready energetically, maybe with some kind of generator, because there will be definitely some big changes in the horizon in the next few months.
[01:54:14.021 --> 01:54:14.862]  That's right.
[01:54:14.882 --> 01:54:17.667]  They say she's about to step down.
[01:54:17.507 --> 01:54:22.507]  but we will see also the Queen fading out gradually.
[01:54:22.507 --> 01:54:26.507]   That's right, they say she's about to step down, like it's all the planets are aligning.
[01:54:26.507 --> 01:54:33.507]  Yes, so basically a new king in England, a new Pope in Rome.
[01:54:33.942 --> 01:54:36.463]  We are living times of great change.
[01:54:36.623 --> 01:54:40.365]  So what is going to happen to us if we are not ready?
[01:54:40.425 --> 01:54:51.630]  We need absolutely to prepare because the big cities, especially like I explain in my latest book, which talks about the great regions.
[01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:58.349]   A way in which we can reject the great reset which is taking place.
[01:54:58.349 --> 01:55:04.470]   And in Europe, for example, they are already discussing the possibility in the next few
[01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:09.869]  months of rationing electricity, rationing gas.
[01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:18.269]   It's almost impossible to think that Russia will not completely cut the gas towards countries
[01:55:18.269 --> 01:55:20.070]  like Italy in the next few years.
[01:55:20.086 --> 01:55:21.046]  And let's expand on that.
[01:55:21.066 --> 01:55:21.926]  That was my next question.
[01:55:21.946 --> 01:55:22.987]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:55:23.767 --> 01:55:27.088]  We have the admissions that Russia is now the biggest oil exporter.
[01:55:27.508 --> 01:55:28.069]  The U.S.
[01:55:28.109 --> 01:55:30.690]  just two years ago was the biggest, then Saudi Arabia, then Russia.
[01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:32.530]  Now under Biden, the U.S.
[01:55:32.830 --> 01:55:35.171]  is third.
[01:55:35.671 --> 01:55:41.034]   Russia is about to replace Saudi Arabia as the major oil exporter.
[01:55:41.455 --> 01:55:47.878]  The globalists obviously knew this would make Russia the biggest exporter and now India one of the biggest refiners.
[01:55:48.399 --> 01:55:50.180]  What's the big picture there behind the scenes?
[01:55:51.431 --> 01:55:55.535]  Well, business has actually increased for Russia.
[01:55:55.655 --> 01:56:00.520]  They are not suffering from the sanctions because they're simply selling their oil to China.
[01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:11.830]  The only problem might be in the next couple of years to readdress the course of their gas pipelines, because that's a little bit more complicated.
[01:56:11.890 --> 01:56:22.234]   But having said that, We are definitely sanctioning ourselves with these sanctions, not Russia, because they are simply changing the name of McDonald's to something else.
[01:56:22.434 --> 01:56:23.695]  And by the way, Biden admits that.
[01:56:23.735 --> 01:56:25.255]  He says it's part of the Great Reset.
[01:56:25.275 --> 01:56:29.296]  He says it's good for you to transition, but they're not giving us anything to transition for.
[01:56:29.376 --> 01:56:32.957]  So while they claim they're defending America, aren't they really selling us out?
[01:56:34.315 --> 01:56:44.746]  They are absolutely selling us out and they are of course planning to starve a lot of America, like they're planning to starve most of the population of this planet.
[01:56:44.886 --> 01:56:59.218]   Let's not forget that now famine and after we had of Of course, the bacteriological warfare, which, of course, the biological warfare that we have seen with the virus and with the vaccines.
[01:56:59.298 --> 01:57:01.199]  Now we have also the famine.
[01:57:01.539 --> 01:57:07.684]  The possibility that the people will really be starving is a concrete possibility.
[01:57:07.804 --> 01:57:21.253]   It's not just... And I also noticed another thing, Alex, that the price increase of the food here In America is bigger than the price increase in Europe, which actually should be the opposite.
[01:57:22.874 --> 01:57:33.280]  I was speaking with my mother the other day and she told me about the price increases in the supermarkets in Europe and they were quite modest compared to what is happening here in America.
[01:57:33.620 --> 01:57:39.103]  So there is a lot of speculation that is going on here in the United States of America.
[01:57:39.523 --> 01:57:45.628]  And of course, Joe Biden is simply a face for something that is behind the scenes.
[01:57:45.648 --> 01:57:46.689]  That's right, he's a front guy.
[01:57:46.709 --> 01:57:50.252]  What do you make of him falling off the bicycle, completely deranged?
[01:57:50.273 --> 01:57:53.575]  We have the Queen getting ready to step down, the Pope getting ready to step down.
[01:57:53.956 --> 01:57:57.539]  What is the exit strategy when you look into all your research for Joe Biden?
[01:57:58.641 --> 01:58:07.588]  Well, you see, they are depicting all the old folks as when you have a guy like Joe Biden, he's giving a bad name to old people.
[01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:12.331]  That's what he's doing, because they are planning to remodel our society.
[01:58:12.391 --> 01:58:19.817]  So then we can have young folks like Zelensky, people that are simply minority judge.
[01:58:22.359 --> 01:58:28.261]  Behind the scenes, you will have basically the same old people, but they will have this new front.
[01:58:29.061 --> 01:58:46.327]  And so at the moment for them to have a guy like Joe Biden showing that is virtually impossible to be in the White House at a certain age, they are kind of mining the possibility for future presidents, including, of course, the comeback of Donald J. Trump.
[01:58:47.958 --> 01:58:48.399]  Amazing.
[01:58:48.439 --> 01:58:50.681]  Leo Zagami, final segment with you straight ahead.
[01:58:50.701 --> 01:58:53.144]  I've got a lot of questions, but what are you going to hit when you come back?
[01:58:55.246 --> 01:59:06.458]  Well, I would like also to discuss the link between demonic possessions and the vaccines, which actually is surfacing now in the Catholic Church.
[01:59:07.205 --> 01:59:07.686]  Well, that's right.
[01:59:07.746 --> 01:59:12.491]  More and more people are acting psychotic, not just having heart attacks, not just getting cancer once they take it.
[01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:15.034]  It's doing things to the brain.
[01:59:15.114 --> 01:59:19.319]  Leo Zagami is our guest, and I want to get you on about your book.
[01:59:19.359 --> 01:59:19.760]  I've read it.
[01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:20.961]  It's amazing.
[01:59:21.261 --> 01:59:22.603]  Your new Illuminati book is incredible.
[01:59:22.623 --> 01:59:23.284]  We should carry that.
[01:59:23.304 --> 01:59:24.145]  We carry some of your books.
[01:59:24.585 --> 01:59:28.664]   at Infowarsstore.com, but you can find Leo Zagami's books by just searching his name.
[01:59:28.664 --> 01:59:32.864]   We'll be right back with the final segment of special guest in the fourth hour.
[01:59:32.864 --> 01:59:33.824]  I don't know if we'll get these calls.
[01:59:33.824 --> 01:59:38.423]   I got to a lot of them and I'm trying as best I can, but I'm back in the saddle and honored to be here.
[01:59:38.423 --> 01:59:42.944]   Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, Leo Zagami is our guest.
[01:59:42.944 --> 01:59:45.704]  We'll be right back, please stay with us.
[01:59:45.704 --> 01:59:48.264]   This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas,
[01:59:48.537 --> 01:59:56.804]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:59:57.284 --> 01:59:59.767]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:59:59.787 --> 02:00:01.248]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:00:01.588 --> 02:00:03.470]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:05.833]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[02:00:06.093 --> 02:00:07.154]  This is all confirmed.
[02:00:07.194 --> 02:00:08.135]  This is not a drill.
[02:00:08.295 --> 02:00:12.219]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:00:12.559 --> 02:00:13.961]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:00:14.101 --> 02:00:14.582]  Apple 100%.
[02:00:14.982 --> 02:00:20.588]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:00:21.048 --> 02:00:25.792]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:00:26.132 --> 02:00:26.973]  This is happening.
[02:00:27.013 --> 02:00:34.939]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:00:35.019 --> 02:00:40.983]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:00:41.384 --> 02:00:49.350]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[02:00:50.210 --> 02:00:53.753]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:00:53.833 --> 02:00:57.256]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:00:57.556 --> 02:01:04.602]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:01:04.822 --> 02:01:07.504]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:01:07.844 --> 02:01:13.049]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:18.410]   It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States with traitors
[02:01:18.410 --> 02:01:21.859]   inside the major security agencies blocking Trump's resistance of the
[02:01:21.859 --> 02:01:25.819]   program and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com
[02:01:25.819 --> 02:01:29.770]   slash big tech hanging combine emergency situation. I have been chosen for
[02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:33.459]   destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering ramming it out
[02:01:33.459 --> 02:01:38.060]   as much as I can. They want to double use me as they always do in any
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:43.189]   complex system of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is
[02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:45.950]  turned against us.
[02:01:44.085 --> 02:01:48.967]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:01:49.347 --> 02:01:52.448]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[02:01:52.668 --> 02:01:54.268]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[02:01:54.468 --> 02:02:02.251]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:02:02.771 --> 02:02:09.476]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:02:09.636 --> 02:02:15.300]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:20.264]  Only your full understanding of this, KE, will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:02:20.284 --> 02:02:22.365]  I have given you the transmission!
[02:02:22.465 --> 02:02:23.406]  Now break free!
[02:02:27.134 --> 02:02:36.420]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:39.122]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:02:39.222 --> 02:02:44.845]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:02:46.066 --> 02:02:51.649]  All right, final segment, Leo Zegami.
[02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:53.851]  Got a guest host, the fourth hour, going short at 3 p.m.
[02:02:53.871 --> 02:02:54.111]  today.
[02:02:56.636 --> 02:03:02.878]  Jack Masovic and others have tweeted out the link to the film, Alex's War, that some great documentary filmmakers made.
[02:03:03.458 --> 02:03:05.338]  Showing what we've really done over the last 28 years.
[02:03:05.898 --> 02:03:07.859]  We appreciate Jack Masovic putting that out and others.
[02:03:08.299 --> 02:03:13.420]  The film is linked up on InfoWars.com, the trailer to the film.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:24.803]  So in the eight minutes we have left, Leo Sagami, big picture, what would you describe the world as right now and where it's going and other key points you'd like to impart to people?
[02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:37.391]  Well, like I just said before the break, there is an increasing amount of fully vaccinated people that are basically showing strong signs of demonic possessions.
[02:03:37.711 --> 02:04:05.488]   And that's why the Catholic Church is actually opening a center in the Philippines, a worldwide, unique kind of center dedicated to exorcism, because there is really this link The lockdowns have also generated the isolation and an increased amount of people that are fighting with their demons or fighting with demons depending on your point of view.
[02:04:05.908 --> 02:04:11.059]   So we are really really in front of the population of the world being
[02:04:11.059 --> 02:04:18.829]   increasingly possessed. We are of course facing all this evil from the big pharma because it all
[02:04:18.829 --> 02:04:28.278]   generates from that Flexner report from 1910 when they basically started to deride eclectic medicines,
[02:04:28.278 --> 02:04:30.449]  osteopathy, homopathy.
[02:04:30.646 --> 02:04:36.192]  They destroyed natural medicine and then they went on to establish their big pharma.
[02:04:36.232 --> 02:04:39.855]  But the big pharma is also linked with the demonics.
[02:04:40.175 --> 02:05:04.610]   So it's quite incredible that Father Jose Francisco Sica has actually admitted this link because at the same time today I also published an article showing that the Vatican has actually minted new coins blessing the COVID-19 vaccination with This is kind of incredible that the Vatican is putting out a coin.
[02:05:04.630 --> 02:05:06.551]  By the way, it's a 20 euro coin.
[02:05:06.571 --> 02:05:07.352]  So that's over $20.
[02:05:07.892 --> 02:05:17.779]  And with the rising inflation, we start figuring out that they're getting ready for it, where basically $20 or 20 euros would just be a coin.
[02:05:18.319 --> 02:05:19.200]  Imagine that, Alex.
[02:05:21.352 --> 02:05:35.978]  And on top of all of this, of course, the Archdiocese of Manila and the Office of Exorcism that they are establishing said that demons are also linked with the electrical world, with the technological world.
[02:05:36.398 --> 02:05:59.771]   And after an exorcism, the chief exorcist denounced that demons were actually even sending messages to his mobile I know that this might sound incredible, but this was said by Father Giuseppe Francisco Sica, who is the chief exorcist of this facility, so it's not something that I'm making up.
[02:05:59.891 --> 02:06:06.896]  There is definitely a society where aggressive satanism and demonic possession is in the increase.
[02:06:07.516 --> 02:06:34.563]   At the same time, we are viewing all the characteristics of this end-time scenario, where we are facing the end of the Western civilization as we know it, but also of this American-centric New World Order, which is leaning now, like I also specified already in February, towards a Sino-Russian new world order. What does that mean? It means that, of
[02:06:34.563 --> 02:06:41.203]   course, next we're also going to be facing the invasion of Taiwan, which is going to be, of
[02:06:41.203 --> 02:06:47.722]   course, like the Ukraine of the East. The problem being, though, that like Joe Biden
[02:06:47.722 --> 02:06:53.653]   already said, America has pledged to defend Taiwan. So that will be definitely a direct
[02:06:53.653 --> 02:07:01.253]   confront. I mean, that it will bring us in a direct war with China, a war that we can't afford.
[02:07:01.253 --> 02:07:09.113]   We can hardly afford a confrontation of this kind, even if it's not a direct war with Russia. It
[02:07:09.113 --> 02:07:14.704]   will be unimaginable to think that we are also in war with China, because that will
[02:07:14.704 --> 02:07:17.574]  completely bankrupt our whole system.
[02:07:17.547 --> 02:07:25.136]  Which is the plan to bring in the world government, the New Cashless Society, new programmable digital tokens, social credit score they've announced.
[02:07:26.138 --> 02:07:27.460]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:07:27.821 --> 02:07:33.670]  So none of this makes sense for prosperity or peace or a good future, but it makes sense to the New World Order.
[02:07:34.491 --> 02:07:36.334]  Don't we expose their agenda then?
[02:07:36.694 --> 02:07:38.757]  Is there any way to get the globalists to stop doing this?
[02:07:40.231 --> 02:07:58.729]  At the local level, there is some initiatives that we can take here in the United States of America, where we have a federal system which is open to independence from counties, from cities, even without reaching the whole of a state.
[02:07:58.929 --> 02:08:04.615]  The Sanders is a great example of that, but the power has to be exercised by we, the people, through local government.
[02:08:05.791 --> 02:08:11.294]  Yes, but we the people also have to understand that probably the cities are lost.
[02:08:12.195 --> 02:08:19.939]  The cities, unfortunately, are in the hands of the enemy and most of them are in the hands, of course, of the democrats.
[02:08:20.219 --> 02:08:23.241]  And I don't think we can recover the cities.
[02:08:23.321 --> 02:08:27.203]  So we need to prepare our reality outside of the cities.
[02:08:27.263 --> 02:08:30.365]  This is something I always stress and I will continue to stress.
[02:08:30.425 --> 02:08:31.005]  Let's be clear.
[02:08:31.686 --> 02:08:35.886]   can't help but abuse and suck off of and destroy anything they have control of.
[02:08:35.886 --> 02:08:39.906]   So if we can just remove ourselves while they collapse things, they'll destroy the cities
[02:08:39.906 --> 02:08:41.965]  we will then inherit them.
[02:08:41.965 --> 02:08:43.285]  People think, oh, they've got the cities.
[02:08:43.285 --> 02:08:48.646]   No, just stand back while they destroy it, and then they'll burn themselves out.
[02:08:48.646 --> 02:08:50.086]  Well we hope they will do that.
[02:08:50.085 --> 02:08:56.529]  But there is also a problem here, Alex, that the cities might become smart cities in the hand of cyber Satan and his robots.
[02:08:56.989 --> 02:09:12.818]  So it's going to be a little bit difficult when we have that in place, because we are all moving, like you also said, towards a reality in which artificial intelligence is all controlling and all encompassing, especially when we make the next move towards transhumanism.
[02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:20.702]  Which is that move also which I talk about in my book from the Internet of Things to the Internet of Body.
[02:09:20.982 --> 02:09:28.586]  I mean the Internet of Bodies meaning that we are actually interacting with our own bodies with the artificial intelligence.
[02:09:28.686 --> 02:09:29.507]  Very impressive.
[02:09:29.527 --> 02:09:30.767]  Leo, I said this to you a year ago.
[02:09:30.807 --> 02:09:31.408]  I said it again.
[02:09:31.428 --> 02:09:32.988]  We're carrying some of your books.
[02:09:33.008 --> 02:09:34.029]  I need to carry the new book.
[02:09:34.589 --> 02:09:34.870]  Thank you.
[02:09:34.690 --> 02:09:40.770]   But we want to get you back on about the very system and the mindset of the enemies of humanity.
[02:09:40.770 --> 02:09:42.850]  But regardless, huge things are afoot.
[02:09:42.850 --> 02:09:44.930]  The Queen of England getting ready to step down.
[02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:46.690]  The Pope getting ready to step down.
[02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:48.250]  Biden in deep trouble.
[02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:49.490]  All of this is incredibly important.
[02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:51.850]  Leo Zegami, thank you so much.
[02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:52.850]  Thank you.
[02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:53.850]  God bless you.
[02:09:53.850 --> 02:09:54.850]  All right.
[02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:56.810]  Kate Daly is about to take over.
[02:09:56.810 --> 02:09:58.170]  And then Owen Schroer in one hour.
[02:09:58.710 --> 02:10:02.653]  And just remember, the enemy works around the clock to stop these broadcasts.
[02:10:02.673 --> 02:10:10.101]  So when you spread the word and share the live links to InfoWars.com forward slash show and man.video, it changes the world.
[02:10:10.141 --> 02:10:11.042]  Great job to the crew.
[02:10:11.062 --> 02:10:12.603]  Great job to everybody else.
[02:10:12.643 --> 02:10:13.644]  We thank you so much.
[02:10:14.265 --> 02:10:19.069]  Now, Kate Dally coming up, and then Owen Schroer with The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.430]  Central.
[02:10:21.258 --> 02:10:21.899]  Hey, everybody.
[02:10:21.959 --> 02:10:22.499]  How are you?
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.340]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:23.500 --> 02:10:24.241]  I'm Kate Dally.
[02:10:24.401 --> 02:10:30.047]  I am from katedallyradio.com and of course sitting in on the Alex Jones Show today and appreciate that.
[02:10:30.067 --> 02:10:31.528]  I appreciate you listening too.
[02:10:31.969 --> 02:10:33.490]  There's so many topics at hand.
[02:10:33.550 --> 02:10:34.391]  I get it.
[02:10:34.411 --> 02:10:37.174]  I mean, our food shortages look really dire.
[02:10:37.234 --> 02:10:39.376]  I'm talking to farmers all over and it's quite a mess.
[02:10:39.856 --> 02:10:40.956]  And it will be a mess for 2023.
[02:10:41.096 --> 02:10:46.017]  And I think that's when we're really going to see it peak is this fall and winter.
[02:10:46.137 --> 02:10:50.298]  We'll probably see a little bit of that and then going into next year from what my farmers are telling me.
[02:10:50.898 --> 02:10:53.579]  Also, everyone's pretty horrified at the pump.
[02:10:53.739 --> 02:10:54.239]  You should be.
[02:10:54.619 --> 02:10:54.919]  I am.
[02:10:56.199 --> 02:11:05.161]  And then, of course, they're getting very desperate to get those shots in our arms, even all the way down to babies now having the FDA approval, whatever that means, because they're so corrupt.
[02:11:05.721 --> 02:11:16.283]  But the FDA approval of babies, even though the Pfizer documentation is still leaking out and still quite nefarious and horrifying, to tell you the truth.
[02:11:16.644 --> 02:11:20.444]  I've been reading through those documents and it's so horrifying what they're trying to hide.
[02:11:20.464 --> 02:11:23.965]  Again, it can ruin your immune system.
[02:11:24.105 --> 02:11:25.025]  It can bring on cancer.
[02:11:25.045 --> 02:11:26.346]  It can bring on autoimmune.
[02:11:26.386 --> 02:11:32.127]  I mean, there's so many things that can happen from destroying our immune systems, which is really what's going on with those shots.
[02:11:32.768 --> 02:11:37.372]  But today I want to talk about two things that don't get talked a lot.
[02:11:37.492 --> 02:11:40.695]  One is about our history that never gets a light shone on it.
[02:11:41.095 --> 02:11:43.737]  And then also I want to talk a little bit about UFOs.
[02:11:43.818 --> 02:11:44.458]  I know you heard me.
[02:11:44.878 --> 02:11:45.519]  UFOs.
[02:11:45.859 --> 02:11:53.686]  But there's a reason I want to talk about that and I want to talk about something that's coming because I think it's really important to kind of keep your eye on it.
[02:11:54.146 --> 02:11:58.070]  So I have what's called Freedom Tourette's.
[02:11:59.398 --> 02:12:04.784]  I can't stop saying things that are true in the face of not being popular.
[02:12:04.904 --> 02:12:12.413]  And of course, this month, the month of June, every company is going all in so that they can get money in the future for the Great Reset.
[02:12:12.713 --> 02:12:14.956]  So they're going all in for this month of June.
[02:12:14.976 --> 02:12:15.997]  You know what I'm talking about.
[02:12:16.437 --> 02:12:19.541]  And it's really hard to watch this in our country, watch this happen.
[02:12:21.055 --> 02:12:28.321]  What's interesting to me is this last Juneteenth on Monday, and the banks were closed, and the mail didn't come, and everything else.
[02:12:28.881 --> 02:12:44.313]  And this holiday is so... Well, only a total libtard can make sense out of the fact that you go around destroying every monument, every monument, that has even sometimes little to do with slavery, right?
[02:12:45.054 --> 02:12:48.577]  Only to build up a holiday that reminds you of slavery.
[02:12:49.744 --> 02:12:49.904]  Yeah.
[02:12:50.265 --> 02:12:55.209]  I mean, sometimes there's just... I don't even know what to say to libertards anymore.
[02:12:55.229 --> 02:13:00.874]  I have a really hard time discussing anything with them because they're afraid the climate's going to come get them every decade.
[02:13:01.374 --> 02:13:05.798]  And then also, I don't know, they're just a whole different class of people.
[02:13:06.098 --> 02:13:07.079]  So I have a really tough time.
[02:13:07.119 --> 02:13:07.720]  I apologize.
[02:13:10.123 --> 02:13:11.143]  They don't know our history.
[02:13:11.684 --> 02:13:13.104]  Many people don't know our history.
[02:13:14.345 --> 02:13:23.468]  And I didn't even know our history until I had to dive in and start studying it and realizing what a gift America has been to the world, the establishment of the Constitution.
[02:13:23.908 --> 02:13:35.252]  If anything, we should be always congratulating the Constitution that set the pace for the rest of the world in getting rid of worldwide slavery after centuries.
[02:13:35.652 --> 02:13:36.553]  We never talk about that.
[02:13:36.613 --> 02:13:39.014]  We only talk about big, bad America and their slaves.
[02:13:39.454 --> 02:13:45.618]  Well, the problem was it was going on for the whites, the purples, the blacks, the Asians, the... You name it.
[02:13:46.298 --> 02:13:46.839]  You name it.
[02:13:46.879 --> 02:13:47.499]  The Irish.
[02:13:47.979 --> 02:13:48.459]  You name it.
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:49.600]  We had slaves.
[02:13:50.241 --> 02:13:50.921]  All the way along.
[02:13:51.454 --> 02:14:00.300]  And so, from the Irish slaves to the Welsh miners to the black Africans to the Roman slaves, slavery was a mindset and a product of humanity.
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:03.122]  Whether we want to look at that or not, that was centuries old, right?
[02:14:03.743 --> 02:14:08.266]  And then it took the founding of America to finally become the domino effect around the world.
[02:14:08.646 --> 02:14:12.349]  And a lot of kids do not know what I'm about to talk about on the show.
[02:14:12.389 --> 02:14:14.190]  They do not know this piece of history.
[02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:15.111]  Maybe you don't know it.
[02:14:15.271 --> 02:14:15.691]  I don't know.
[02:14:16.111 --> 02:14:18.933]  Hopefully, we'll be able to enlighten a few people today.
[02:14:21.064 --> 02:14:25.245]  In the past, slavery was indentured servitude for the most part.
[02:14:25.585 --> 02:14:35.669]  And indentured servitude, it took about 8 years, 10 years to earn your servitude, and then you would be freed, given a little bag of food and maybe some clothes, and you were on your way.
[02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:37.869]  And that was to pay your passage over.
[02:14:37.929 --> 02:14:38.970]  How lovely of them, right?
[02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:44.972]  Because they didn't come, some of them, because they obviously didn't want to, but we brought them over anyway.
[02:14:45.432 --> 02:14:50.815]   And so, indentured servitude versus slavery, Is very, very different.
[02:14:50.895 --> 02:14:59.898]  And I want to talk about that when we come back, because there's something I want to, I want to talk about in slavery that happened in 1600 that kind of changed the face of everything.
[02:15:00.498 --> 02:15:05.240]  So, when you know this piece of history, then everything else, you can kind of look at America totally different.
[02:15:05.440 --> 02:15:09.321]  We freed slavery within 80 years of the Constitution being established.
[02:15:09.341 --> 02:15:10.061]  It's pretty awesome.
[02:15:10.141 --> 02:15:10.782]  I'll be right back.
[02:15:10.842 --> 02:15:13.503]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:13.783 --> 02:15:14.263]  I'll be right back.
[02:15:15.231 --> 02:15:18.513]  Hi, Kate Daly, back with you sitting in on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:18.793 --> 02:15:21.374]  And let me just tell you, we have so much to go over today.
[02:15:21.815 --> 02:15:22.715]  So much I want to bring you.
[02:15:23.035 --> 02:15:27.498]  And this piece of history is so not known, and I don't know why.
[02:15:27.658 --> 02:15:28.358]  Well, I do know why.
[02:15:28.999 --> 02:15:32.220]  Concerted effort to change history starting in 1907.
[02:15:33.341 --> 02:15:34.982]  But we have the notes to prove it.
[02:15:35.542 --> 02:15:36.263]  But, here we go.
[02:15:36.583 --> 02:15:38.724]  So, let's talk about this just a little bit.
[02:15:38.844 --> 02:15:44.948]  So, the first group of 20 slaves came over in the year 1600, and one was a black man.
[02:15:45.028 --> 02:15:46.429]  His name was Anthony Johnson.
[02:15:46.889 --> 02:15:52.892]  Anthony Johnson did his servitude, 8 to 10 years, which was pretty typical in that time, and earned his freedom.
[02:15:53.413 --> 02:15:56.975]  And then he became very wealthy and bought other black slaves.
[02:15:57.235 --> 02:15:58.256]  You never hear about this, right?
[02:15:59.707 --> 02:16:03.748]  He bought other black slaves, and he bought another black man named John Cazor.
[02:16:03.888 --> 02:16:06.189]  And John Cazor, why is John Cazor famous?
[02:16:06.689 --> 02:16:20.920]   Because his black master, Anthony Johnson, pursued a case in Pennsylvania court that the idea that Cazor should become a slave for life, not just for the eight years, And Johnson won this.
[02:16:21.481 --> 02:16:27.868]  So a black man owning a black man now for life instead of indentured servitude is what Johnson got initially.
[02:16:28.389 --> 02:16:30.951]  He was not going to give that same thing to Kassur.
[02:16:31.392 --> 02:16:39.701]  So Kassur became a lifelong slave, opening the door for the precedents that would include three million slaves owned for life throughout and up to 1863.
[02:16:41.485 --> 02:16:42.706]  Many people do not know this.
[02:16:42.826 --> 02:16:45.288]  I guarantee your kids were never taught this in school.
[02:16:45.428 --> 02:16:51.032]  That it was a black man that went to court for another black man to become a slave for life.
[02:16:51.753 --> 02:16:53.454]  Not necessarily the white guy.
[02:16:54.295 --> 02:16:56.376]  So in the South, slavery was really evident.
[02:16:56.456 --> 02:17:02.381]  But honestly, when you really look at this situation, and I'm not minimizing slavery, so whatever.
[02:17:02.501 --> 02:17:03.402]  I'm not minimizing it.
[02:17:03.442 --> 02:17:07.265]  What I'm saying is, only 347,000 families owned slaves.
[02:17:07.585 --> 02:17:09.046]  And they were primarily in the South.
[02:17:09.924 --> 02:17:14.489]  And that was out of a population of 30 million Americans just before the Civil War.
[02:17:14.729 --> 02:17:16.051]  So put that into perspective.
[02:17:16.371 --> 02:17:22.998]  It was about 3 million slaves, 347,000 families, and out of the whole United States.
[02:17:23.519 --> 02:17:28.745]  So America in its entirety did not own slaves, especially up in the northern states.
[02:17:29.225 --> 02:17:32.709]  The northern states, though, get a little more credit than they deserve, and I'll tell you why.
[02:17:33.249 --> 02:17:36.293]  Slavery was not kind of the national ideal.
[02:17:36.473 --> 02:17:44.862]  It was in certain states, and from the time the ink was dry on the Constitution, many white people in America fought to change hearts and minds.
[02:17:45.522 --> 02:17:46.783]  It took about 80 years.
[02:17:46.863 --> 02:17:52.368]  Harriet Tubman was born at the end of it, and so she was not instrumental, nor was she ever the face of it.
[02:17:52.428 --> 02:17:53.409]  It was white Quakers.
[02:17:53.930 --> 02:18:01.456]  White Quakers got together with their entire congregations, risking their lives, risking everything, to form the Underground Railroad.
[02:18:01.496 --> 02:18:03.738]  But that started when the Constitution Inc.
[02:18:03.778 --> 02:18:04.339]  was dry.
[02:18:04.819 --> 02:18:07.862]  Because the All Men Created Equal could never have happened overnight.
[02:18:07.922 --> 02:18:11.145]  It had to happen over a series of time.
[02:18:12.071 --> 02:18:17.962]  And so, we know that we were setting that forward, that George Washington was very intent.
[02:18:18.002 --> 02:18:21.068]  And here we're coming up on Independence Day, so this is a great lesson for us.
[02:18:21.767 --> 02:18:26.428]  They were very intent on putting all men created equal, but they also knew it wasn't going to happen overnight.
[02:18:26.568 --> 02:18:32.189]  George Washington wanted to free his slaves as an example, because really it was an industry thing.
[02:18:32.369 --> 02:18:34.870]  It was, this is how we make money, we have these slaves.
[02:18:35.070 --> 02:18:40.771]  Again, not saying it was great, not saying it was right, because slavery needed to be ended.
[02:18:40.911 --> 02:18:45.872]  But it was only America that was going to change the face of what that looked like around the world.
[02:18:46.292 --> 02:18:52.114]  Because everybody used that as an example and stopped the practice that had been going on for centuries!
[02:18:52.834 --> 02:18:54.155]  This is what we don't understand.
[02:18:54.675 --> 02:19:01.957]  Harriet Tubman came along in the 50 years after it had even been established, the Underground Railroad.
[02:19:02.377 --> 02:19:04.218]  Mostly she got out her own family members.
[02:19:04.558 --> 02:19:10.120]  It wasn't even a case of her going out and spending her entire life for all these other people.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:11.180]  Mostly it was family.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:14.662]  But what's interesting is, is they wanted to make her the face of it.
[02:19:14.742 --> 02:19:19.164]  They wanted her to be the reason the Underground Railroad existed.
[02:19:19.804 --> 02:19:28.509]  And so they, the white Quakers and some slaves that had already been freed, that had went up north, went ahead and constructed the Underground Railroad.
[02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:29.090]  Think about it.
[02:19:29.210 --> 02:19:34.332]  Slaves could have never left their homes in order to construct such a railroad.
[02:19:34.512 --> 02:19:38.335]  They never could have had the means to do it, or know who to trust.
[02:19:38.395 --> 02:19:40.616]  It was the white Quakers, actually, that did it.
[02:19:41.196 --> 02:19:47.780]  And so that we're really really in charge of it and there's many stories along the way that prove that and talk about it in history if you look it up.
[02:19:48.221 --> 02:19:56.266]  I go to periodicals, I go to articles, I go to things in the past to make sure I know what I'm talking about so that I can present that to you.
[02:19:56.286 --> 02:19:57.927]  I wish more people could do that.
[02:19:58.547 --> 02:20:04.371]  And so the movement was started in the late 1700s and then of course it only took 80 years for it to come to pass.
[02:20:05.407 --> 02:20:07.849]  But the Civil War was not fought over slavery.
[02:20:07.869 --> 02:20:09.911]  It was fought over, really, profit and money.
[02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:14.896]  It was fought over the South remaining independent and being able to profit.
[02:20:15.357 --> 02:20:17.219]  And so there were a lot of issues at stake.
[02:20:17.279 --> 02:20:19.060]  It was more of a state's thing than it was.
[02:20:19.541 --> 02:20:24.686]  We did not want to become the federal, the over-cumbersome federal United States.
[02:20:24.967 --> 02:20:25.187]  Okay?
[02:20:27.310 --> 02:20:43.821]  Now that we know this, even lynching came from a word, that word came from a man named Willie Lynch, who back in colonial America was asked to share his diabolical methods for slave treatment, such as lynching, with the colonials who owned slaves.
[02:20:43.961 --> 02:20:50.546]  And so, he was basically lynching the Irish, and then the colonials asked him, well, how do you do that?
[02:20:50.626 --> 02:20:51.566]  What's going on with that?
[02:20:51.586 --> 02:20:56.269]   But isn't it interesting that it was practiced On the white Irish first.
[02:20:56.710 --> 02:21:01.592]  That word came from the white Irish and did not originate with the slaves here.
[02:21:02.293 --> 02:21:04.995]  So there's a lot of correction in history that we need to do.
[02:21:05.495 --> 02:21:10.838]  But when it comes to Juneteenth, here's a great statement from Brian McClanahan, historian.
[02:21:10.918 --> 02:21:16.321]  He said, hereditary slavery did not end in the United States until December 6th.
[02:21:16.922 --> 02:21:18.302]  Remember that date?
[02:21:18.963 --> 02:21:20.984]  1865, the ratification date of the 13th Amendment.
[02:21:21.909 --> 02:21:27.614]  Slave auctions continued in Kentucky until November 1865, about two years later.
[02:21:28.235 --> 02:21:32.798]  Five months after slavery supposedly was supposed to end on June 19th, 1865.
[02:21:34.099 --> 02:21:40.165]  So if the last slaves were told they were free on June 19th, then what about all the slaves sold into slavery after that point?
[02:21:40.505 --> 02:21:41.526]  Because it was taking place.
[02:21:42.863 --> 02:21:43.843]  That would be news to them.
[02:21:44.364 --> 02:21:52.466]  And so Delaware, Kentucky, and New Jersey, all slave states in 1865, actually rejected the 13th Amendment to the Constitution.
[02:21:53.427 --> 02:21:54.047]  They rejected it.
[02:21:54.887 --> 02:21:59.088]  And slavery was legal in each state until December 6 months after June 19, 1865.
[02:22:02.205 --> 02:22:03.645]  So it's really strange.
[02:22:03.746 --> 02:22:08.307]  Oh, by the way, Delaware, Kentucky, and New Jersey were technically all Union states.
[02:22:08.607 --> 02:22:12.268]  Oh, I thought the Union was fighting to free the slaves.
[02:22:12.368 --> 02:22:14.269]  Why would they reject the 13th Amendment?
[02:22:14.409 --> 02:22:15.009]  Good question.
[02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:21.471]  So, during the war, though Kentucky was a special case, could be considered a Confederate state.
[02:22:22.131 --> 02:22:22.412]  Maybe.
[02:22:22.872 --> 02:22:27.113]  Only Mississippi rejected the 13th Amendment from the former Confederate states.
[02:22:27.573 --> 02:22:29.894]  People don't know this, but this is our history.
[02:22:30.490 --> 02:22:41.299]  And I hope that we can share our history with our kids and grandkids because we're losing a lot of time and we're losing a lot of this to the progressive left, globalist communists that are trying to destroy the country.
[02:22:41.879 --> 02:22:42.660]  And what are they doing?
[02:22:42.720 --> 02:22:43.641]  Destroying our history.
[02:22:43.741 --> 02:22:49.606]  Tearing down monuments, yet they want to make the biggest federal holiday they can out of Juneteenth.
[02:22:49.986 --> 02:23:06.123]   Not only does it have a ridiculous name, they would love to co-op this and instead of having Independence Day, They would love it to just be Juneteenth, which is absolutely asinine on so many levels, because all it does is say, I'm ignorant about my history and I don't know much.
[02:23:06.543 --> 02:23:21.435]  Because if they really knew what America's role was in this, and how much of that role was given to all of those Quakers all the way along the early 1800s and mid-1800s, you'd feel a lot different about this country, wouldn't you?
[02:23:22.035 --> 02:23:23.336]  It's so odd to me.
[02:23:23.656 --> 02:23:26.798]  Well, not odd, because I expect them to want to destroy our history.
[02:23:27.258 --> 02:23:35.923]  But our history came at the hands of 1907, started getting destroyed through many of our non-profit organizations that we know so well.
[02:23:36.603 --> 02:23:39.244]  And they did a damn good job, didn't they?
[02:23:39.385 --> 02:23:44.587]  Because in high school, you probably never learned what I just talked about on the air.
[02:23:44.848 --> 02:23:45.428]  Probably not.
[02:23:45.588 --> 02:23:46.628]  I'm going to guess that you didn't.
[02:23:46.989 --> 02:23:53.781]   And that it was a black man that went to court in Pennsylvania To own another black man for life.
[02:23:54.955 --> 02:23:57.136]  When was the last time you saw that on a t-shirt?
[02:23:57.416 --> 02:23:57.816]  You didn't.
[02:23:58.416 --> 02:24:03.418]  And so Juneteenth is absolutely asinine that we're celebrating this.
[02:24:04.138 --> 02:24:16.763]  Really, all credit is due and goes back to the Constitution and goes back to the men who decided that we were going to put our people in charge of our own government and that we were not going to let kings rule us anymore.
[02:24:17.103 --> 02:24:27.652]   Because the reason slavery progressed through the centuries is we had kings By decree that said that that said that that slavery became a thing and it became a mindset.
[02:24:27.872 --> 02:24:29.274]  It's hard to change a mindset.
[02:24:29.734 --> 02:24:30.375]  Really tough.
[02:24:30.455 --> 02:24:32.418]  It takes decades and decades to do it.
[02:24:32.718 --> 02:24:34.480]  So it's no wonder that it took 80 years.
[02:24:35.061 --> 02:24:35.801]  But here's the thing.
[02:24:36.262 --> 02:24:37.383]  It only took 80 years.
[02:24:37.944 --> 02:24:38.304]  Didn't take 300.
[02:24:39.659 --> 02:24:41.980]  They act like it took 300 and we're still fighting for this.
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:42.780]  It's ridiculous.
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:50.921]  When was the last time you saw a brawl break out between blacks and whites for the cause of racism in an airport, in an airplane, in a grocery store?
[02:24:51.281 --> 02:24:52.222]  You don't see it.
[02:24:52.942 --> 02:24:54.342]  Because we're not a racist country.
[02:24:54.542 --> 02:24:56.623]  We just keep getting fed the lie that we are.
[02:24:57.303 --> 02:24:58.823]  And so we have to counteract that.
[02:24:59.243 --> 02:25:00.423]  I'm going to be right back.
[02:25:00.523 --> 02:25:05.264]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com in for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:05.565 --> 02:25:06.485]  I'll be right back.
[02:25:06.525 --> 02:25:07.345]  Let's talk UFOs.
[02:25:08.061 --> 02:25:09.602]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:09.622 --> 02:25:12.284]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, and happy to be here.
[02:25:12.364 --> 02:25:13.065]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:25:13.705 --> 02:25:15.566]  And so, by the way, get those supplements.
[02:25:15.826 --> 02:25:19.909]  I would order as much as you possibly can right now.
[02:25:20.069 --> 02:25:30.576]  After talking to farmers across the country, as the shortages we're about to see, I would actually, this summer, I'd order extra antibiotics, have them on hand.
[02:25:30.636 --> 02:25:34.379]  I would order extra everything, extra supplements.
[02:25:34.895 --> 02:25:37.636]  The supplements that Alex has are really great.
[02:25:37.796 --> 02:25:40.978]  They are fantastic quality and I would get a lot of them.
[02:25:41.138 --> 02:25:44.079]  I really would and I would stock up your shelves as much as you possibly can.
[02:25:44.139 --> 02:25:45.039]  It'll keep on the shelf.
[02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:47.941]  So let's talk UFOs.
[02:25:48.521 --> 02:25:56.545]  This is not going to be a popular subject with some people because I have a very different view on UFOs and I don't believe in them.
[02:25:56.805 --> 02:25:59.706]  And so right away if you're going, how could you not believe in them?
[02:26:00.347 --> 02:26:01.308]  I'm going to lay out my case.
[02:26:01.788 --> 02:26:02.729]  I do a lot of research.
[02:26:03.329 --> 02:26:10.073]  And after tens of thousands of hours of research, I can tell you that I used to be very open to the thought of it.
[02:26:10.654 --> 02:26:13.876]  And then after a lot of homework, no way.
[02:26:14.336 --> 02:26:14.636]  Sorry.
[02:26:15.317 --> 02:26:16.638]  We're being sold a box of rocks.
[02:26:16.838 --> 02:26:19.319]  But I want to lay out my case and then you can decide.
[02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:23.582]  So I have this t-shirt on and this t-shirt says, The End Is Near.
[02:26:23.722 --> 02:26:24.443]  I love this t-shirt.
[02:26:24.463 --> 02:26:28.025]  It makes me laugh for a totally different reason than probably people are buying it.
[02:26:28.045 --> 02:26:29.786]  It has a picture of a spaceship on it.
[02:26:30.433 --> 02:26:37.035]  And there's more truth to this, there's more truth to this t-shirt than people realize, okay?
[02:26:37.356 --> 02:26:39.356]  The end is near, big spaceship, okay?
[02:26:39.996 --> 02:26:41.777]  And I laugh every time I wear this.
[02:26:42.097 --> 02:26:43.258]  So let me lay out the case.
[02:26:43.798 --> 02:26:57.420]   Every week right now, and for the last, say, three or four years, there has been a steady barrage of strange stories coming out where the government completely flipped its case, and now instead of hiding it, They are going to tell you the truth.
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:26:59.480]  I love it when government tells me the truth.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:01.041]  I feel so warm and fuzzy all over.
[02:27:02.922 --> 02:27:03.802]  Said no one with a brain.
[02:27:04.582 --> 02:27:06.763]  Anyway, so they're telling us the truth right now.
[02:27:06.943 --> 02:27:09.864]  And they're telling us that, of course, they are very, very real.
[02:27:11.064 --> 02:27:12.605]  And they're leaking it out.
[02:27:13.045 --> 02:27:13.986]  I love government leaks.
[02:27:15.806 --> 02:27:18.487]  And so let's bring up a couple of things.
[02:27:18.687 --> 02:27:28.727]   And so I started looking at some research and I went back into the Solid articles and recognition of things in the sky.
[02:27:29.487 --> 02:27:36.672]  And before the 1940s, we only had 13 situations where somebody saw something in the sky.
[02:27:37.432 --> 02:27:39.533]  It was never little green men.
[02:27:40.014 --> 02:27:43.676]  Because one thing you need to ask yourself is, what is the motivation?
[02:27:45.017 --> 02:27:48.639]  Why did they wait until the 1940s to come and probe us?
[02:27:49.901 --> 02:27:51.302]  Everybody needs a good anal probing.
[02:27:51.922 --> 02:27:54.144]  So that's basically all they do.
[02:27:54.404 --> 02:27:57.506]  Anyway, so why did they wait till the 1940s?
[02:27:57.726 --> 02:27:59.628]  Why weren't they coming down all the time?
[02:27:59.788 --> 02:28:01.269]  Why isn't there more record of that?
[02:28:01.969 --> 02:28:04.471]  That's the question people should be asking, right?
[02:28:05.031 --> 02:28:05.872]  Why did they wait?
[02:28:06.672 --> 02:28:08.393]  And so I went back into history.
[02:28:08.454 --> 02:28:11.796]  There were 13 different examples.
[02:28:12.552 --> 02:28:17.413]  Before 1897, going centuries back of any recording whatsoever.
[02:28:17.833 --> 02:28:22.454]  But the problem is, is that it looks more like a comet in the sky when they're describing it.
[02:28:22.874 --> 02:28:24.475]  They're not describing little green men.
[02:28:25.455 --> 02:28:26.895]  So keep that in mind, okay?
[02:28:27.615 --> 02:28:31.116]  So really, no little green men sightings until about the 1940s.
[02:28:31.136 --> 02:28:32.016]  From 1917 to 1940, nothing.
[02:28:32.036 --> 02:28:33.217]  Zero.
[02:28:33.237 --> 02:28:33.337]  Okay?
[02:28:33.176 --> 02:28:38.176]  From 1917 to 1940, nothing, zero, okay?
[02:28:38.176 --> 02:28:43.377]  Since 1940, 176 reports on alien encounters.
[02:28:43.377 --> 02:28:46.377]  encounters.
[02:28:44.532 --> 02:28:46.313]  Wow, they got busy after 1940.
[02:28:47.453 --> 02:28:51.334]  And that's right about the time we constructed the UN for global domination, wasn't it?
[02:28:51.615 --> 02:28:52.755]  In the 40s, if I recall.
[02:28:54.195 --> 02:28:54.655]  Interesting.
[02:28:54.816 --> 02:28:57.356]  That's when pharma came into being, too, so remember that, too.
[02:28:57.376 --> 02:29:09.380]  Okay, they really, I mean, they were into, they came into being in the late 1800s, but they really staked their claim after all of the experimentations going on on the Jews over in Nazi Germany.
[02:29:09.813 --> 02:29:10.133]  Okay.
[02:29:10.893 --> 02:29:16.695]  So then we had 56 encounters from 1940 to just 1960 in a 20-year span.
[02:29:16.735 --> 02:29:17.435]  That's a lot.
[02:29:17.575 --> 02:29:18.896]  Boy, they kicked up their heels.
[02:29:18.916 --> 02:29:20.376]  They got real busy, the little green men.
[02:29:20.776 --> 02:29:24.117]  Then 176 alien encounters since that inception.
[02:29:24.578 --> 02:29:29.379]  And that was since the League of Nations, okay, became the UN, right?
[02:29:30.219 --> 02:29:35.261]  And, of course, you have a series of events that look like a comet.
[02:29:35.908 --> 02:29:38.890]  Then we get to the 1940s, and this is really interesting.
[02:29:38.930 --> 02:29:44.253]  I mentioned Nazi Germany because I go back to Werner Von Braun, which again goes right back to my t-shirt, okay?
[02:29:45.194 --> 02:29:48.215]  The end is near, big spaceship, okay?
[02:29:48.396 --> 02:29:54.739]  And he said to Carol Rosen, here he is a Nazi scientist, okay?
[02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:57.721]  And then we put him as the head of NASA.
[02:29:58.702 --> 02:30:08.526]   On his deathbed, for no apparent reason, with no motivation whatsoever, he said, Carol to his assistant, which she has been proclaiming ever since the 70s.
[02:30:09.527 --> 02:30:11.428]  There is a lie being told to everybody.
[02:30:12.008 --> 02:30:14.309]  And you have to stop the weaponization of space.
[02:30:15.390 --> 02:30:18.752]  And he said the weaponization of space is not coming from the Russians.
[02:30:19.292 --> 02:30:22.654]  Okay, that was a lie at the time that we were being told he said this.
[02:30:23.335 --> 02:30:25.216]  And he says and then there would be terrorism.
[02:30:25.236 --> 02:30:31.459]  Okay, well, you've had a lot of that right ISIS with matching outfits and Toyota trucks well funded.
[02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:34.481]  Anyway, then there would be asteroids.
[02:30:35.382 --> 02:30:38.083]  And how many times in the news in the last few years have you been hearing that?
[02:30:38.924 --> 02:30:39.844]  An asteroid's coming.
[02:30:39.864 --> 02:30:43.626]  An asteroid's probably gonna hit Earth, Planet X, whatever the case may be.
[02:30:44.887 --> 02:30:50.930]  And the last card they would play, da-da-da-da, would be the extraterrestrial threat.
[02:30:52.130 --> 02:30:55.292]  But it was going to be a threat, and they were going to play it out.
[02:30:55.732 --> 02:31:07.602]   So I guess now we can see why, for so many years, it made it look like they were hiding something, when really they were just playing around with Greater technology than one can fathom, I think, in this day and age.
[02:31:08.162 --> 02:31:10.824]  But then all of a sudden they start, what, leaking out the stories.
[02:31:11.164 --> 02:31:12.665]  But think about the motivation for that.
[02:31:12.945 --> 02:31:15.207]  What was the motivation to leak out stories?
[02:31:16.328 --> 02:31:20.350]  Why all of a sudden start to give people what they want?
[02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:22.071]  Oh, they're finally going to talk about aliens.
[02:31:22.632 --> 02:31:23.172]  Why is that?
[02:31:23.792 --> 02:31:25.573]  Nobody ever asks about motivation.
[02:31:26.374 --> 02:31:27.755]  But isn't it the biggest question?
[02:31:29.016 --> 02:31:34.279]  He told his assistant, and here he is, Nazi, war criminal, that we made head of NASA.
[02:31:34.699 --> 02:31:38.062]  There was no motivation at all for him to say these things on his deathbed.
[02:31:39.102 --> 02:31:44.365]  He said, we have to have some reason to spend millions of dollars, and that is due to satellites.
[02:31:45.426 --> 02:31:59.278]   The issue, though, is that NASA's always been a black hole, and I think for money laundering, just like cigarettes, money laundering through cigarettes, through different countries, Um, was the same kind of scapegoat for drugs, right?
[02:31:59.298 --> 02:32:00.879]  They use cigarettes for a long time.
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:06.142]  And so I look at this whole scenario being played out and I try to step back a little bit.
[02:32:06.783 --> 02:32:09.324]  Gee, aliens never wanted to come and probe us.
[02:32:10.505 --> 02:32:12.146]  Seems to be the only thing they do, am I right?
[02:32:13.126 --> 02:32:13.907]  Good anal probing?
[02:32:13.947 --> 02:32:15.548]  I mean, honestly, think about it.
[02:32:16.890 --> 02:32:22.853]  Any accounts, which really, this was all after MKUltra, so could be accounts of people on some serious drugs.
[02:32:23.833 --> 02:32:28.115]  But all the accounts are, they pulled me into an aircraft and they probed me and then they let me go.
[02:32:28.135 --> 02:32:31.157]  That's a whole lot of probing for a lot of decades.
[02:32:31.877 --> 02:32:32.097]  Why?
[02:32:32.457 --> 02:32:33.157]  What's the point?
[02:32:33.638 --> 02:32:34.778]  What are they doing, right?
[02:32:35.318 --> 02:32:38.900]  And so I always thought it was kind of funny because no one could ever answer that question.
[02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:40.081]  It was like, they probed us!
[02:32:40.281 --> 02:32:41.181]  Well, why?
[02:32:42.041 --> 02:32:43.142]  What would be the reason for that?
[02:32:43.880 --> 02:32:59.765]  So before 1940s, you really didn't have much going on, but you did have a meeting, post League of Nations, where John Dewey from the good old Dewey Decimal System was meeting, actually, with Japan.
[02:32:59.805 --> 02:33:00.665]  They were meeting with Japan.
[02:33:00.705 --> 02:33:02.746]  This is 1917, actually.
[02:33:03.406 --> 02:33:06.827]  And he was, at the time, with Columbia University.
[02:33:06.867 --> 02:33:08.648]  And here is the express written record.
[02:33:09.208 --> 02:33:14.693]  To think that is one of our greatest desires of the American people, and this is one of the great desires that New York expresses to you.
[02:33:14.733 --> 02:33:15.694]  This is 1917.
[02:33:15.774 --> 02:33:23.701]  To the conclusion of your happy visit with us, John Dewey, professor of philosophy at Columbia University, who was the next speaker, was listened to with great intentness.
[02:33:24.081 --> 02:33:32.128]  He said, someone remarked, in the best way to unite all the nations on this globe would be an attack from some other planet.
[02:33:33.229 --> 02:33:33.530]  Hmm.
[02:33:34.210 --> 02:33:34.771]  Interesting.
[02:33:35.481 --> 02:33:45.661]  John Dewey says that and then all of a sudden we start to get all of these interesting visitations that no one can really examine.
[02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:47.424]  I'll be right back.
[02:33:48.203 --> 02:33:50.244]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:50.284 --> 02:33:51.065]  I have so much more.
[02:33:51.325 --> 02:33:52.746]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:52.786 --> 02:33:54.126]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:33:54.547 --> 02:33:55.747]  So glad to be here with you.
[02:33:56.348 --> 02:33:58.509]  And so glad to share these things with you.
[02:33:58.529 --> 02:34:03.291]  Part of the research I've done over the years, and I think it's important research to take in.
[02:34:03.472 --> 02:34:10.936]  Even if you still believe that aliens are coming to get us, at least you'll have this as background and context too.
[02:34:10.976 --> 02:34:12.016]  That's what I figure anyway.
[02:34:12.376 --> 02:34:13.157]  I'm always open.
[02:34:13.377 --> 02:34:14.698]  Trust me, I'm always open to things.
[02:34:15.598 --> 02:34:19.401]   But on this one, I think that we are well played.
[02:34:19.882 --> 02:34:20.483]  I really do.
[02:34:20.503 --> 02:34:25.488]  And I think this was a way actually to make us look a little nutty, to tell you the truth.
[02:34:26.289 --> 02:34:29.772]  But here we go, because I know a lot of people disagree with me.
[02:34:29.893 --> 02:34:30.213]  It's fine.
[02:34:30.996 --> 02:34:32.957]  I feel like I haven't had that happen before.
[02:34:34.018 --> 02:34:49.447]  So, John Dewey of the Dewey Decimal System, although John Dewey wasn't the Dewey Decimal System when this was happening, was at the meeting where Japan came, this was prior to World War II, and obviously this was prior to League of Nations.
[02:34:50.067 --> 02:34:51.488]  This was in 1917.
[02:34:51.888 --> 02:35:13.199]  He said at this world meeting that he said he was listened to, it was John Dewey, professor of philosophy in Columbia University, who was the next speaker at this event, was listened to with great intentness, and he said, someone remarked that the best way to unite all the nations on this globe would be an attack from some other planet.
[02:35:13.879 --> 02:35:19.302]  Maybe Wernher von Braun, the Nazi criminal, but then became head of NASA, was right.
[02:35:20.163 --> 02:35:26.669]  Maybe they were actually going to use an alien hoax to bring us together.
[02:35:26.990 --> 02:35:27.570]  Think about this.
[02:35:30.163 --> 02:35:32.924]  You go to the movies, and what do you usually witness?
[02:35:33.144 --> 02:35:36.866]  You usually witness a group of people all dressed in grey in the future.
[02:35:37.466 --> 02:35:38.406]  Why is it always grey?
[02:35:38.426 --> 02:35:39.147]  That's what I want to know.
[02:35:39.307 --> 02:35:41.127]  Anyway, are we colorblind?
[02:35:41.167 --> 02:35:41.648]  What's going on?
[02:35:42.108 --> 02:35:46.970]  Anyway, so it's always a group dressed in grey, and they are the world government, right?
[02:35:47.010 --> 02:35:50.251]  And they solve the problem of what's been going on.
[02:35:50.291 --> 02:35:51.731]  America, out the door.
[02:35:52.172 --> 02:35:58.214]   Sovereignty of any nation, out the door, because we all must come together For this huge threat that's coming our way.
[02:35:58.614 --> 02:36:01.476]  It's a great way to install the New World Order, in other words.
[02:36:01.996 --> 02:36:11.221]  And I think they actually have been really successful about it because all you have to do is look like, well, we're hiding it since the 1940s and we're not going to let anybody know.
[02:36:11.581 --> 02:36:13.883]  But really what we're doing is working on technology.
[02:36:13.903 --> 02:36:23.528]  And we probably would be pretty surprised to see where our tax dollars have gone in DARPA and all of these other agencies that freely use our money.
[02:36:24.208 --> 02:36:29.491]  Um, and so we have constructed things that even might possibly look like alien ships.
[02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:30.111]  You never know.
[02:36:30.131 --> 02:36:38.676]  The technology, when people are looking at technology, it's kind of like how would somebody in the year 1600 look at a cell phone and try to describe it?
[02:36:39.176 --> 02:36:43.659]  So if we're describing something in the sky, how do you know that we didn't construct it?
[02:36:44.579 --> 02:36:44.879]  Hmm.
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:46.380]  With DARPA money.
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:53.264]  Because we really are not allowed onto those places, Area 51 and so forth, and they sure are secretive.
[02:36:54.329 --> 02:36:59.930]  So there was only one account in 1897, and actually the newspaper said it was a tall tale.
[02:36:59.970 --> 02:37:01.290]  It was in Texas, by the way.
[02:37:01.930 --> 02:37:06.311]  And they now say it was a fictional UFO story.
[02:37:06.911 --> 02:37:08.512]  But that didn't really kick it off.
[02:37:08.552 --> 02:37:11.792]  It was really the 1940s and the 1950s.
[02:37:12.652 --> 02:37:15.753]  Surprisingly, what also came along at this time?
[02:37:15.773 --> 02:37:17.133]  Oh yeah, the CIA.
[02:37:17.553 --> 02:37:19.653]  Love the CIA.
[02:37:19.753 --> 02:37:20.954]  Big heart emoji for the CIA.
[02:37:23.257 --> 02:37:26.139]  Anyway, can anyone actually tell me anything they've done that's good?
[02:37:27.279 --> 02:37:33.283]  So an extraordinary, this is what they wrote as far as their role in 1947 to 1990, okay?
[02:37:33.783 --> 02:37:36.445]  1947, remember those 40s.
[02:37:37.845 --> 02:37:44.529]  An extraordinary 95% of all Americans have at least heard or read something about a UFO, unidentified flying object.
[02:37:44.749 --> 02:37:45.630]  Wasn't that convenient?
[02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:48.011]  I think it was because the press kept talking about it.
[02:37:48.031 --> 02:37:49.332]  57% believe they are real.
[02:37:51.685 --> 02:37:53.766]  Ah, but they were going to try to do a better job than that, right?
[02:37:54.146 --> 02:37:55.126]  So former U.S.
[02:37:55.186 --> 02:37:58.947]  Presidents Carter and Reagan have claimed to even seen a UFO.
[02:37:59.907 --> 02:38:04.349]  And that private UFO organizations are found throughout the United States.
[02:38:04.669 --> 02:38:06.189]  And many are convinced that the U.S.
[02:38:06.249 --> 02:38:11.210]  government, particularly CIA, are engaged in a massive conspiracy.
[02:38:11.250 --> 02:38:13.011]  This was written about the CIA role.
[02:38:13.571 --> 02:38:16.512]  Are engaged in a massive conspiracy and cover up the issue.
[02:38:17.132 --> 02:38:28.856]  The idea that the CIA has secretly concealed research into UFOs has been a major theme of UFO buffs since the modern UFO phenomena emerged in the late 1940s.
[02:38:29.456 --> 02:38:32.017]  Coincidentally, right about the time of the CIA.
[02:38:32.437 --> 02:38:39.160]  Isn't it kind of amazing that we had the CIA to keep the information secret right when it came out?
[02:38:40.780 --> 02:38:45.382]  If I was a coincidence theorist, I'd be like, yep, total coincidence there.
[02:38:45.962 --> 02:38:46.362]  But I'm not.
[02:38:47.336 --> 02:39:21.495]   So, in the late 1993, after being pressured by UFOlogists after the release of additional CIA information on UFOs, James Woolsey, what a gem, ordered the review of all agency files on UFOs and using CIA records compiled from that review, of course the CIA has all the records, of course they do, This study traces CIA interests, super interested, and involvement, very, very involved in the UFO controversy from the late 1940s to 1990.
[02:39:21.895 --> 02:39:27.017]  And they said it chronologically examines the agency's efforts to solve the mystery of UFOs.
[02:39:27.777 --> 02:39:29.798]  They're gonna solve their own creation?
[02:39:29.938 --> 02:39:30.378]  Interesting.
[02:39:30.838 --> 02:39:38.460]  So its programs had an impact on the UFO sightings and its attempts to conceal CIA involvement in the entire UFO issue.
[02:39:39.102 --> 02:39:42.105]  Just make something look like it's concealed to make people want it more.
[02:39:43.246 --> 02:39:57.978]  What emerges from this examination is that while agency concern over UFOs was substantial until the early 1950s, CIA has paid only limited and peripheral attention to the phenomena.
[02:39:58.659 --> 02:39:59.920]  Oh, I think they've done more than that.
[02:40:00.544 --> 02:40:03.665]  And so, that background is really interesting, isn't it?
[02:40:03.725 --> 02:40:25.533]  Because the first report of a flying saucer over the United States came on June 24th, see that's in a couple of days, anniversary, 1947, when Kenneth Arnold, a private pilot, reputable businessman, while looking for a downed plane, sighted nine disc-shaped objects near Mount Rainier, Washington, traveling at an estimated speed of over 1,000 miles.
[02:40:27.409 --> 02:40:35.612]  If he really did see this, my guess would be that we've been very, very busy in the technology department with things that we didn't know we could create.
[02:40:35.652 --> 02:40:42.874]  You know, the Nazis were really far ahead in some technologies and very interesting that nobody ever asked that question.
[02:40:43.075 --> 02:40:44.795]  Why did we create these things?
[02:40:44.995 --> 02:40:47.016]  How do you know they're from outer space?
[02:40:48.109 --> 02:40:51.291]  I always feel like we're made in God's image.
[02:40:51.771 --> 02:40:55.273]  I really don't think we'd have anybody competing that's three foot two and green.
[02:40:55.973 --> 02:41:04.658]  But, with that being said, I think that this has been a tremendous hoax laid out on us, and I think we've all been pretty played.
[02:41:05.138 --> 02:41:10.120]  So Arnold's report was followed by a flood of additional sightings, imagine that.
[02:41:10.921 --> 02:41:14.923]  Just a flood, including reports from military and civilian pilots.
[02:41:15.043 --> 02:41:17.024]  When did the CIA really get established?
[02:41:18.231 --> 02:41:18.972]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:41:19.012 --> 02:41:23.095]  It was the OSS and then it became 1947-1948.
[02:41:23.115 --> 02:41:24.215]  Right about that time.
[02:41:25.116 --> 02:41:27.518]  What a coincidence for the coincidence theorists.
[02:41:30.254 --> 02:41:35.336]  Basically, a huge amount of new sightings came into effect.
[02:41:36.117 --> 02:41:45.380]  And in 1948, the Air Force, head of the Air... Nathan Twining, head of the Air Force Service Command, established Project Sign.
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:46.441]  It's always a project.
[02:41:46.981 --> 02:41:48.821]  Initially named Project Saucer.
[02:41:50.182 --> 02:41:51.122]  I guess that was too obvious.
[02:41:51.643 --> 02:41:56.099]   To collect and evaluate and distribute Right?
[02:41:56.179 --> 02:42:04.409]  Within the government, all information related to such sightings on the premise that UFOs might be real of national security concern.
[02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:14.481]  And now all of a sudden, for exactly no motivation at all, they seem to want you to know that they're real by releasing the information.
[02:42:14.501 --> 02:42:16.103]  Have they ever said why?
[02:42:16.897 --> 02:42:28.446]  Have they ever said what the motivation is in suddenly doing a complete 180 and saying, oh yep, now it exists after we tried to say it didn't exist for decades and now it all of a sudden does?
[02:42:29.047 --> 02:42:33.370]  Is that because they're getting ready to play this in the biggest way possible?
[02:42:34.511 --> 02:42:34.911]  Could be.
[02:42:35.752 --> 02:42:36.933]  And isn't that kind of scary?
[02:42:37.353 --> 02:42:40.416]  This all came along right after the advent of the CIA.
[02:42:40.696 --> 02:42:42.898]  And then the CIA holds all the information.
[02:42:43.538 --> 02:42:44.659]  I find that kind of interesting.
[02:42:44.779 --> 02:42:45.400]  Not the states.
[02:42:47.153 --> 02:42:54.367]  The CIA, by the way, they got a lot more feds on the payroll and they're really trying to go grow federal police.
[02:42:54.387 --> 02:42:56.030]  That's a whole different show, but.
[02:42:56.866 --> 02:43:18.096]  That was one of the reasonings behind Uvalde was that they would make the local police look totally inept again, just like they did in Florida, Broward County, and then introduce more federal, federal FBI agents to cover where the ineptness of the local cop, you know, this is why SWAT became really a police force at every turn.
[02:43:18.716 --> 02:43:19.577]  Cat stuck in a tree?
[02:43:19.797 --> 02:43:20.538]  Go get SWAT.
[02:43:20.898 --> 02:43:21.338]  That's why.
[02:43:21.859 --> 02:43:27.123]  And so the CIA being very federalized, along with the Feds, everything's going to Central, right?
[02:43:27.223 --> 02:43:27.683]  We know this.
[02:43:27.783 --> 02:43:31.546]  Central Control is really one of their biggest weapons against us.
[02:43:31.886 --> 02:43:33.187]  And they're doing it marvelously.
[02:43:33.748 --> 02:43:34.529]  Be right back.
[02:43:34.789 --> 02:43:37.931]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:37.951 --> 02:43:39.632]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:39.693 --> 02:43:40.613]  So happy to be here.
[02:43:40.693 --> 02:43:41.534]  Thanks again, Alex.
[02:43:41.694 --> 02:43:44.917]  And I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:43:44.957 --> 02:43:45.757]  I do a daily show.
[02:43:49.048 --> 02:43:52.871]  Going back to Wernher von Braun, Nazi criminal but then became head of NASA.
[02:43:53.031 --> 02:43:55.352]  I like how we like to put the criminals at the head of everything.
[02:43:55.433 --> 02:43:56.153]  Kind of interesting.
[02:43:56.513 --> 02:44:08.702]  It was also a Nazi scientist that came up with just a theory on climate change that Al Gore seemed to want to ride in to be able to become a member of our government.
[02:44:09.682 --> 02:44:18.407]  But it's always interesting to me these Nazi criminals, war criminals that we really sort of liked.
[02:44:18.667 --> 02:44:25.070]  Anyway, so remember what he said on his deathbed with no motivation whatsoever to say this, okay?
[02:44:25.191 --> 02:44:26.351]  And I always look for motivation.
[02:44:26.391 --> 02:44:29.793]  I think that's a really big tell on what somebody's saying and why.
[02:44:32.466 --> 02:44:36.227]  So, they said the weaponization of space, you gotta stop that.
[02:44:37.747 --> 02:44:39.948]  NASA was a black hole for a lot of money laundering.
[02:44:40.388 --> 02:44:49.030]  And that, he didn't really exactly say that, that comes from other research I've done, but he did say that they had to have a reason to spend millions and millions of dollars up there.
[02:44:50.010 --> 02:44:56.612]  But that also, that we would be told these lies, that the weaponization of space is coming from the Russians.
[02:44:57.901 --> 02:45:20.317]  I don't think it was, and he said it wasn't, that there would be terrorism threats, and once that didn't work anymore, then there would be the threat of the asteroid, and then after asteroids didn't work, they would then, the last card they would ever play, hence the t-shirt, the end is near with the spaceship, we have to have some reason, or the last card would be the extraterrestrial threat.
[02:45:22.399 --> 02:45:29.244]   So if they bring that in, And we're threatened with this, and boy have we been manipulated with a lot of movies, right?
[02:45:29.424 --> 02:45:34.128]  And a lot of text, context to be able to go, oh yeah, we can totally see this coming.
[02:45:34.168 --> 02:45:42.133]  Because really and truly, they have shown us movies about this for decades, I think, to really sort of open us up to the idea.
[02:45:42.213 --> 02:45:43.374]  That's how it works, right?
[02:45:43.454 --> 02:45:52.840]  Disney's there to groom children, and the rest of them are there to groom us as far as this is where we're going with the world, and isn't it great?
[02:45:53.638 --> 02:45:54.278]  Said no one ever.
[02:45:54.899 --> 02:45:56.580]  So, what is Project Bluebeam?
[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:59.661]  And I do want to talk about this for a moment because I think this is very interesting.
[02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:20.733]  According to Sergey Minost, who died suddenly at the age of 49, who I'd love to interview but can't, just suddenly, the four-step project was designed by NASA and the United Nations and it would allow these organizations to accomplish what he believed their ultimate goal was in creating a new age religion, right?
[02:46:21.671 --> 02:46:26.575]  Um, led by the Antichrist and in order to start the new world order dictatorship.
[02:46:27.116 --> 02:46:38.625]  So NASA would implement Project Blue Beam with a system of advanced mind control as well as top secret technology in order to trick everyone into believing there had been a second coming of sorts.
[02:46:38.665 --> 02:46:39.406]  Kind of interesting.
[02:46:40.066 --> 02:46:40.967]  Now think about this.
[02:46:41.227 --> 02:46:48.213]  At the advent of the CIA and MKUltra and all the experimentation with all the drugs that they were doing, right?
[02:46:49.503 --> 02:46:53.406]  Isn't it interesting that they talk about advanced mind control?
[02:46:53.486 --> 02:46:57.949]  What has the CIA been working on since the very beginning and the inception of the CIA?
[02:46:57.989 --> 02:47:01.251]  Now, didn't the CIA tell us they were there to catch the bad foreign guy?
[02:47:02.332 --> 02:47:11.058]  Well, why is it then that really the bulk of what they were doing then was all about manipulating us and how they were doing it and how they could do it in the future?
[02:47:11.578 --> 02:47:17.542]  And so it is interesting that this whole project is about top secret technology as far as advanced mind control.
[02:47:18.464 --> 02:47:23.607]  So the first step would be involving the manufacturing artificially created earthquakes, right?
[02:47:24.307 --> 02:47:30.110]  And then you would have the second step, and that would involve a gigantic space show.
[02:47:30.451 --> 02:47:39.956]  And during this stage of Project Bluebeam, the three-dimensional optical hologram, as well as laser projections to hologram images, would beam across the sky.
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:42.781]  And what would these images include?
[02:47:42.941 --> 02:47:48.963]  Probably a lot of maybe Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus, like different pictures, right, would merge into one.
[02:47:49.623 --> 02:48:07.690]  And then he explained that the technology behind this display saying that the conspirators would use space-based laser generating satellites to project simultaneous images to the four corners of this planet in every language and dialect according to the region and the whole sky would be transformed into a massive movie screen.
[02:48:08.746 --> 02:48:13.327]  And people would believe their eyes because their eyes would be seeing something that they think is real.
[02:48:14.667 --> 02:48:17.568]  The third step is where the mind control takes center stage.
[02:48:18.008 --> 02:48:22.009]  Now think about this and think about the shots that they're so desperate.
[02:48:22.349 --> 02:48:25.810]  A series of shots, not just a shot, a series of shots.
[02:48:25.930 --> 02:48:27.530]  What in the hell are they building in our bodies?
[02:48:27.991 --> 02:48:28.291]  Okay?
[02:48:28.851 --> 02:48:33.972]  There's a reason that according to the sniffles, you're supposed to run down in fear and get this shot.
[02:48:34.674 --> 02:48:42.981]  Even though only 1% of our nation even has a problem with their immune immunity that would even look at this thing, they're trying to get it in everybody's arms.
[02:48:43.261 --> 02:48:43.581]  Why?
[02:48:44.762 --> 02:48:46.444]  Well, the third step was mind control.
[02:48:47.184 --> 02:48:52.509]  Telephonic communication devices that would send waves to reach each person within their own minds.
[02:48:53.429 --> 02:48:59.534]  How could you do that unless you put something in everybody's body that would enable them to do that?
[02:49:00.415 --> 02:49:03.137]  What is the whole CIA goal been for years and years and years?
[02:49:03.537 --> 02:49:04.098]  Mind control.
[02:49:05.077 --> 02:49:07.959]  Why study mind control so intently?
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:09.100]  Why?
[02:49:10.341 --> 02:49:30.697]  If we weren't being assaulted left and right as a country, if people weren't really out to get us at every single turn, because I do think we were told that for years and years and years to get us to be put in fear, and not even question the fact that we hadn't actually been attacked, okay, but just in fear, the CIA reaches out to only work on mind control?
[02:49:31.818 --> 02:49:32.559]  Hmm, strange.
[02:49:33.459 --> 02:49:41.404]  So then this third step, so convincing them that their own God is speaking to them through the very depths of their soul.
[02:49:42.465 --> 02:49:43.025]  Interesting.
[02:49:43.706 --> 02:49:48.749]  And so how would these rays be able to reach each person's inner mind in order to tell them something?
[02:49:48.769 --> 02:49:50.790]  Because look at, look at it this way.
[02:49:50.970 --> 02:49:54.893]  Everybody with COVID thought everyone was dying everywhere else, just not in front of them.
[02:49:56.294 --> 02:50:00.697]  So we weren't even seeing anything and people still refer to it as the pandemic and the plague.
[02:50:00.717 --> 02:50:00.877]  Okay.
[02:50:02.279 --> 02:50:10.947]  So then what happens when people see something with their own eyes and they're sure they saw it, even though they're not quite really sure of what they saw, they're sure they saw it.
[02:50:12.508 --> 02:50:18.233]  I think it'd be much harder to get people to really examine the way they believe in the things that they're seeing, right?
[02:50:18.373 --> 02:50:20.235]  Because we tend to believe what we see.
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:23.482]  That could be a very big problem for us later on.
[02:50:23.903 --> 02:50:31.791]  And they said that, hey, these such rays from satellites are fed into the memories of computers that have stored massive data on every human on Earth.
[02:50:32.311 --> 02:50:33.933]  Think about all the DNA testing.
[02:50:34.273 --> 02:50:37.696]  Think about all of the computers that have led to control over us.
[02:50:37.877 --> 02:50:39.058]  And they know everything about us.
[02:50:39.098 --> 02:50:39.939]  Look at Facebook, okay?
[02:50:40.539 --> 02:50:45.841]  The rays then interface with natural thinking to form what we call diffuse artificial thought.
[02:50:46.321 --> 02:51:03.327]  And finally, the fourth step would be to make use of all these various technologies in order to convince people that alien invasions and the rapture itself was taking place and making it easier for the powers that be that take control to a very fear-laden populace.
[02:51:04.247 --> 02:51:06.088]  And so this is kind of interesting, isn't it?
[02:51:06.168 --> 02:51:09.089]  So if you're asking yourself, I know, but can they really do that?
[02:51:10.456 --> 02:51:34.311]  Well, this phenomena first demonstrated as an experiment 1973 at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research by Dr. Joseph Sharp, who personally underwent tests in which he proved he could hear and understand spoken words delivered to him in an echo-free isolation chamber via a pulse microwave audiogram and analog of the word sound vibration beamed into his brain.
[02:51:35.276 --> 02:51:48.043]  And then they went on to state that such a device has obvious application and covert operation designed to drive a target crazy with a voice or deliver undetectable instruction to a programmed asset.
[02:51:48.363 --> 02:51:49.864]  You know we see that all the time, right?
[02:51:50.224 --> 02:51:52.905]  Did you know we never really saw that until the CIA got involved?
[02:51:53.165 --> 02:51:56.127]  And then we didn't really see that until really the 1960s?
[02:51:56.947 --> 02:51:58.188]  The Lone Gun Assassin?
[02:51:59.669 --> 02:51:59.909]  Anyway.
[02:52:00.658 --> 02:52:04.559]  So this was clear back in 73 that they were playing with this technology.
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:14.883]  There was a book in 1978 entitled Microwave Auditory Effect and Application by James C. Lim, and it explained how audible voice can be broadcast directly into the brain.
[02:52:15.183 --> 02:52:19.945]  The technology could be used to make the deaf hear, but instead it has been turned against the public.
[02:52:20.891 --> 02:52:21.911]  Very interesting.
[02:52:21.971 --> 02:52:26.873]  They, of course, studied frogs' hearts by synchronizing the pulse rate.
[02:52:27.574 --> 02:52:32.555]  They did all kinds of different studies, all high frequency studies, too.
[02:52:33.036 --> 02:52:41.499]  And then they were all studied at length by the CIA in 1977 in testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research.
[02:52:42.219 --> 02:52:56.852]   And Dr. Gottlieb, that Jim, Um, who directed the MK Ultra heinous program at that time was forced to discuss aspects of the CIA research to find technique to all of this, the human organs by remote electronic means.
[02:52:57.893 --> 02:53:08.563]  You know, when the first shots first came out, I remembered this and I remembered studying this and I remember thinking, how else could they get people to hear things or get them to believe something?
[02:53:09.346 --> 02:53:11.428]  If they didn't have control from the inside.
[02:53:11.788 --> 02:53:16.371]  And we all know that doctors have said, in the future, you won't even have to step inside a hospital, honey.
[02:53:16.751 --> 02:53:20.154]  We'll be able to just cure you from where we are.
[02:53:20.674 --> 02:53:23.056]  Because we'll have access to the inside of your body.
[02:53:23.076 --> 02:53:24.617]  How do you think that happens?
[02:53:25.297 --> 02:53:27.879]  Unless we're putting an operating system inside our body.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:31.522]  How would you get an operating system inside somebody's body?
[02:53:32.362 --> 02:53:34.304]  Tell them they're in fear of dying from the sniffles.
[02:53:34.824 --> 02:53:35.565]  And they'll believe you.
[02:53:36.946 --> 02:53:37.366]  Honestly.
[02:53:38.567 --> 02:53:39.768]  And so is that where we're going?
[02:53:41.008 --> 02:53:44.970]  Is that really what is going to happen to us with all of those shots?
[02:53:45.250 --> 02:53:47.211]  One must wonder why they're so desperate.
[02:53:47.351 --> 02:53:49.132]  You always have to ask for motivation, don't you?
[02:53:49.932 --> 02:53:53.174]  Why are they so desperate to get that jab into every living soul?
[02:53:53.774 --> 02:53:54.654]  And believe me, they are.
[02:53:54.674 --> 02:53:56.075]  We're going to get more stuff dropped on us.
[02:53:56.875 --> 02:54:02.058]  They really want a series of shots injected into every human on earth, including infants.
[02:54:02.538 --> 02:54:03.398]  There's a reason for that.
[02:54:04.319 --> 02:54:05.119]  They also hate people.
[02:54:06.089 --> 02:54:07.551]  Population control at its finest.
[02:54:07.811 --> 02:54:09.833]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for Alex Jones.
[02:54:09.652 --> 02:54:13.412]   It's been fun and thank you for joining me in this last hour.
[02:54:13.412 --> 02:54:17.732]   The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sale there.
[02:54:17.732 --> 02:54:25.011]   I guess my feeling at this point in time is maybe we need to be completely a little bit
[02:54:25.011 --> 02:54:26.932]  more scary for the public.
[02:54:26.927 --> 02:54:31.632]  Especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[02:54:32.092 --> 02:54:34.174]  We need all the protection that we can get.
[02:54:34.234 --> 02:54:36.036]  That's why the vaccines are so effective.
[02:54:36.376 --> 02:54:39.479]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:54:40.077 --> 02:54:41.738]  We've got to get them vaccinated.
[02:54:42.259 --> 02:54:44.040]  And hopefully they will do it willingly.
[02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:49.964]  I think we really need to make it clear that there are privileges associated with being an American.
[02:54:49.984 --> 02:54:51.125]  We have to be more calm.
[02:54:51.145 --> 02:54:52.566]  We have to be more forceful.
[02:54:52.886 --> 02:54:56.729]  If you do not want to get vaccinated, you can work from home.
[02:54:57.089 --> 02:54:58.791]  You can homeschool your children.
[02:54:59.031 --> 02:55:00.272]  You can shop online.
[02:55:00.652 --> 02:55:02.093]  So where is this coming from?
[02:55:02.173 --> 02:55:05.255]  People saying, I'm now being forced to be vaccinated.
[02:55:05.415 --> 02:55:07.437]  If you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine.
[02:55:07.617 --> 02:55:12.363]  You should be wearing masks even when you are vaccinated if you are indoors.
[02:55:12.643 --> 02:55:16.327]  If you wish to have these privileges, you need to get vaccinated.
[02:55:16.448 --> 02:55:20.793]  We have to say something coming out, you know, you don't get vaccinated, you know you're going to die.
[02:55:20.792 --> 02:55:24.152]  I mean, let's just be really blunt to these people.
[02:55:24.152 --> 02:55:25.833]  Get vaccinated.
[02:55:25.833 --> 02:55:28.952]  Get vaccinated.
[02:55:28.952 --> 02:55:29.913]  Get vaccinated.
[02:55:29.913 --> 02:55:30.952]  Get vaccinated.
[02:55:30.952 --> 02:55:31.993]  Get vaccinated.
[02:55:57.511 --> 02:56:02.313]   You've always thought you couldn't bear press on nails because of all the active things you do?
[02:56:02.390 --> 02:56:05.071]  Pre-colored in seven luscious hues.
[02:56:05.771 --> 02:56:11.252]  Just... Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:56:11.793 --> 02:56:17.074]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:56:17.474 --> 02:56:19.335]  These signals being sent through time.
[02:56:21.894 --> 02:56:23.880]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:56:24.461 --> 02:56:27.590]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[02:56:28.510 --> 02:56:33.714]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[02:56:34.314 --> 02:56:43.141]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[02:56:43.721 --> 02:56:49.045]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[02:56:49.605 --> 02:56:54.909]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[02:56:55.509 --> 02:56:57.511]  Only you can defeat the globalists.
[02:56:57.811 --> 02:56:58.731]  We're in this together.
[02:56:59.172 --> 02:57:02.753]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[02:57:02.833 --> 02:57:07.775]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are my physicians.
[02:57:08.275 --> 02:57:14.157]  So the worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse.
[02:57:18.021 --> 02:57:20.663]  mRNA is messenger RNA.
[02:57:20.843 --> 02:57:29.329]  It's a message that's being sent from your DNA to your cells, telling your cells what to do to maintain health.
[02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:31.830]  In this case, create a protein.
[02:57:32.431 --> 02:57:39.816]  Any technology that does something brand new inside of our bodies needs to be watched for years, if not decades.
[02:57:40.563 --> 02:57:45.165]  If they tell you that it's safe and effective, they're lying because we don't have the data yet.
[02:57:45.746 --> 02:57:50.328]  They need to tell you that you are part of a stage four research experiment.
[02:57:50.448 --> 02:57:51.789]  You are the lab rat.
[02:57:52.189 --> 02:57:53.330]  You are the guinea pig.
[02:57:53.590 --> 02:57:55.611]  This is a scientific dictatorship.
[02:57:55.831 --> 02:57:59.313]  This is the greatest hoax and the greatest power grab in human history.
