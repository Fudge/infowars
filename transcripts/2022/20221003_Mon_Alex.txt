[00:00.000 --> 00:20.400]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30.000 --> 00:55.200]  Throughout the thousands of years, our species grew and developed incredible art, literature,
[00:55.200 --> 01:03.400]  and culture. But in a parallel track, the science of tyranny was brought to levels never
[01:03.400 --> 01:10.600]  before seen. And now together, riding through the cosmos on this beautiful planet, we are
[01:10.600 --> 01:15.800]  being targeted for depopulation, for mass murder, for genocide. To study history, it's
[01:15.800 --> 01:22.200]  replete with examples of corrupt empires and mad leaders and cults attempting total domination
[01:22.200 --> 01:30.280]  and mass death. But always in the end, humanity awakens and rises up and defeats the tyranny.
[01:30.280 --> 01:35.040]  The question is, how long will that tyranny be allowed to continue on before we awaken
[01:35.040 --> 01:40.940]  and before we say no? Well, that huge awakening has begun. It's accelerating and the enemy
[01:40.940 --> 01:44.640]  is throwing everything they can at us to try to stop that. I would tell you who's coming
[01:44.640 --> 01:48.760]  up on the broadcast today, it's one hell of a transmission. I'll host all four hours
[01:48.760 --> 01:56.520]  today. George Ellison, a videographer and reporter on the ground throughout the war,
[01:56.520 --> 02:02.560]  he is in Ukraine, he will be joining us coming up in the second hour to cover the waterfront
[02:02.560 --> 02:07.240]  there. Then the father of the U.S. Biological Chemical Weapons Treaty, also one of the main
[02:07.240 --> 02:12.840]  authors of the International UN World Treaty, Dr. Francis Boyle had been on it six months.
[02:12.840 --> 02:18.920]  And everything he warmed up two and a half years ago has come to pass exactly, exactly
[02:18.920 --> 02:23.800]  like he said it would. Because he has all the connections, he has the research, and
[02:23.800 --> 02:31.420]  he was given the special PhD that Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger got at Harvard
[02:31.420 --> 02:36.600]  that only one person a year gets to be a top manager in the New World Order. He infiltrated
[02:36.600 --> 02:46.160]  them, he had number one degrees, number one scores, and he got their entire operation.
[02:46.160 --> 02:50.400]  That's a big deal. So you better listen. People ask, how do we know so much? Because we know
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.520]  people like Dr. Boyle, we do our research, we read his books, we read his white papers,
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.760]  and he's got some shocking warnings about what's coming next, coming up in the third
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.960]  hour. And then Robert Barnes is set to be landing any minute now. In Austin, Texas he's
[03:03.960 --> 03:11.320]  going to be in studio with me, covering so much in the fourth hour. Now, there's so much
[03:11.320 --> 03:14.880]  huge world news, and I'm not going to try to make this broadcast about myself, even though
[03:14.880 --> 03:18.280]  I'm all over national television, international television, every major newspaper lying about
[03:18.280 --> 03:27.080]  me. But now they're in everything from Reuters to AP to Bloomberg to local Connecticut papers,
[03:27.080 --> 03:31.400]  admitting that Jones is not allowed to put on evidence and Jones is not allowed to defend
[03:31.400 --> 03:36.280]  himself. And then it's an unusual move by the court. Well, it's not unusual, it's never
[03:36.280 --> 03:42.100]  before been done. So we're going to be reading some of these quotes, where they're now going
[03:42.100 --> 03:48.080]  operational with, you know, this is the new system in Democrat-controlled jurisdictions,
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.800]  both criminally and civilly, we're not going to let you defend yourselves. So they can put
[03:53.800 --> 03:57.040]  on whatever fraud they want, none of it's ever challenged, they can talk for hours,
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.120]  every one of their witnesses for days if they want, and that's okay, because they're the
[04:02.120 --> 04:06.120]  moral authority, they're there on the left. So in their desperateness to maintain control,
[04:06.120 --> 04:11.480]  they're going to overdrive using judicial tyranny, election fraud, economic warfare, cultural
[04:11.480 --> 04:17.240]  and spiritual warfare, it's insane. Real polls that are scientific had Bolsonaro winning
[04:17.240 --> 04:21.200]  by five to ten points, but now there's a runoff because the communists who's already been
[04:21.200 --> 04:27.480]  president before, who ran Brazil to the ground, won by about what, seven points, eight points,
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.480]  and so now there's a runoff, and the polls had Bolsonaro 20 points behind. They put
[04:31.480 --> 04:34.960]  out those fake polls to make you think, well, no reason to go vote for him, he's going to
[04:34.960 --> 04:42.320]  lose anyways. Show massive election fraud taking place in Brazil. That's how they've
[04:42.320 --> 04:45.960]  kept control of Mexico and so are there, so many other places. And now it's happening
[04:45.960 --> 04:51.920]  here, ultramassive admissions by one of the big three vaccine makers, that indeed it does
[04:51.920 --> 05:01.080]  cost mass blood clots and death. That's mainstream news, that's coming up as well.
[05:01.080 --> 05:05.720]  Look around you, everything I predicted from the globalist stone documents from their own
[05:05.720 --> 05:11.560]  admissions is now happening. Info wars credibility, my credibility has never been higher, and
[05:11.560 --> 05:16.840]  it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship
[05:16.840 --> 05:22.520]  and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air. But now we're reaching the most
[05:22.520 --> 05:29.240]  critical juncture in the fight together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep
[05:29.240 --> 05:34.280]  me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm
[05:34.280 --> 05:38.840]  being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund
[05:38.840 --> 05:46.720]  those myself. It's unsustainable. So please visit save info wars dot com, save info wars
[05:46.720 --> 05:52.480]  dot com where you can make straight donations, 5, 10, $50, $100, whatever you can, so that
[05:52.480 --> 05:57.120]  I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[05:57.120 --> 06:13.200]  Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you. Save info wars.com big brother mainstream
[06:13.200 --> 06:20.800]  media government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info
[06:20.800 --> 06:42.880]  wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones. Something very fascinating happened in just the last
[06:42.880 --> 06:52.160]  12 hours. Secretary of state Blinken gave a press conference and bragged that it was
[06:52.160 --> 06:58.840]  a great thing that the Nord Stream two pipeline got blown up a week ago. And of course we
[06:58.840 --> 07:03.760]  have Biden saying that they would get rid of it if Russia invaded Ukraine. We have Victoria
[07:03.760 --> 07:11.080]  Newland saying it cryptically. Meanwhile, there's surrogates run around all over television
[07:11.080 --> 07:16.560]  and Twitter and Facebook and everywhere else. And the fact checkers censor anybody including
[07:16.560 --> 07:27.080]  members of Congress that dare point out that these people are bragging that they did it.
[07:27.080 --> 07:32.720]  There was a US naval ship that launches demolition submarine attacks that delivers SEAL team
[07:32.720 --> 07:40.680]  10. There for a month doing drills directly above the pipeline. The new pipeline that
[07:40.680 --> 07:45.480]  was just built by Europe was right next to Nord Stream two. It didn't get touched literally
[07:45.480 --> 07:53.560]  a half mile away. Parallels it. And of course the very same day Nord Stream two was blown
[07:53.560 --> 08:04.840]  up that new pipeline turned on. You cannot make this stuff up. Just the study of gas
[08:04.840 --> 08:11.920]  lighting itself. Now they say they'll blow it up. They blow it up. The same day they
[08:11.920 --> 08:21.480]  turn on their new pipeline. And then Blinken comes out and says this is a good opportunity
[08:21.480 --> 08:26.360]  and all but admits it. But then separately if you say you don't like them blowing up
[08:26.360 --> 08:30.880]  the pipeline, leave countries alone, let them sell energy. Remember the same people
[08:30.880 --> 08:35.520]  was shutting down our pipelines here not just Keystone but so many others. Thousands of
[08:35.520 --> 08:43.400]  spurs, hundreds of major pipelines shut down since Biden got in 20 months ago. 20 plus
[08:43.400 --> 08:49.240]  months ago. Absolutely insane. Wow. Biden Secretary of State Blinken says Nord Stream
[08:49.240 --> 08:54.920]  explosion. A tremendous opportunity for Europe to remove dependency on Russian energy. What
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.680]  did I say the day it happened? I said it doesn't help the Russians. It doesn't even really
[08:59.680 --> 09:06.400]  help the Ukrainians. Hurts the Europeans but helps the globalists destabilize Europe further
[09:06.400 --> 09:11.920]  and when it implodes they'll call for a new Marshall plan. Quadrillions in new currency
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.080]  given to themselves to prop up the economy that themselves are undermining. And that
[09:16.080 --> 09:22.640]  is indeed now precisely what they're doing. So let's, the long clip of him in context,
[09:22.640 --> 09:28.560]  he goes on, is on infowords.com but here's a short clip of Blinken talking about it.
[09:28.560 --> 09:35.160]  Then let's play Victoria Newland and Biden late last year talking about what would happen
[09:35.160 --> 09:41.000]  if the Russians invaded. Here it is. Ultimately, this is also a tremendous opportunity. It's
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.760]  a tremendous opportunity to once and for all remove the dependence on Russian energy and
[09:46.760 --> 09:52.600]  thus to take away from Vladimir Putin the weaponization of energy as a means of advancing
[09:52.600 --> 10:01.640]  his imperial designs. That's very significant and that offers tremendous strategic opportunity
[10:01.640 --> 10:07.680]  for the years to come. But meanwhile, we're determined to do everything we possibly can
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.160]  to make sure that the consequences of all of this are not borne by citizens in our countries
[10:13.160 --> 10:21.120]  or for that matter around the world. With regard to Nord Stream 2, we continue to have
[10:21.120 --> 10:27.520]  very strong and clear conversations with our German allies and I want to be clear with
[10:27.520 --> 10:34.840]  you today. If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move
[10:34.840 --> 10:35.840]  forward.
[10:35.840 --> 10:43.360]  Let me answer the first question first. If Germany, if Russia invades, that means tanks
[10:43.360 --> 10:55.080]  or troops crossing the border of Ukraine again, then there will be no longer Nord Stream 2.
[10:55.080 --> 10:59.000]  We will bring an end to it.
[10:59.000 --> 11:06.920]  But how will you do that exactly since the project and control of the project is within
[11:06.920 --> 11:09.360]  Germany's control?
[11:09.360 --> 11:17.440]  We will, I promise you, we'll be able to do it.
[11:17.440 --> 11:24.400]  America took over the British Empire in 1945 on record, but the criminal globalists got
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.320]  control of America, so they were in control of the world. And that's all you're seeing.
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.440]  That's what's happening. That's what's going on today. And they are shutting down farms
[11:35.440 --> 11:40.520]  and ranches all over Europe, all over Africa, all over Latin America, all over Asia, all
[11:40.520 --> 11:46.400]  over the United States. This just continues and continues and continues. They've told
[11:46.400 --> 11:53.600]  Dutch farmers by 2030, 90% of their cows must be slaughtered. This year, 30% must be sold
[11:53.600 --> 12:01.920]  on average. Some farmers are being told sell or kill half your milk cows this year.
[12:01.920 --> 12:07.800]  You know, the second largest food exporter in the world is the Netherlands. They are
[12:07.800 --> 12:18.440]  incredibly productive, bad-ass people, bad-ass producers, bad-ass engineers, bad-ass farmers.
[12:18.440 --> 12:23.440]  And they're being shut down. Think they're a little pest? And that's happening to everybody.
[12:23.440 --> 12:28.720]  The Netherlands is little. You go there, it's just gorgeous beyond belief, perfectly manicured
[12:28.720 --> 12:36.440]  farms and land and windmills and just, it's kick-ass. Yeah, they don't need solar. They
[12:36.440 --> 12:43.640]  got thousand-year-old windmill technology. Drive by these farms, they don't even need
[12:43.640 --> 12:51.280]  electricity, folks. They've got their own wind power. And they're all announcing in
[12:51.280 --> 12:56.240]  Europe that they're just shutting down production of whole food lines of everything from pickles
[12:56.240 --> 13:07.920]  to tomatoes to potatoes because they can't pay the 500 to 900% increase in food production.
[13:07.920 --> 13:14.400]  But don't worry, Bill Gates and the Globalists are rolling out all this new synthetic food
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.000]  that you're not going to have a choice, you're going to eat it because soon there won't be
[13:18.000 --> 13:26.000]  the choices. Just watch. I told you 11 years ago, 12 years ago now, that they'd have lockdowns
[13:26.000 --> 13:31.640]  and masks and checkpoints and forced inoculations. And the first attack would be bad, but there'd
[13:31.640 --> 13:35.880]  be another attack later, even worse, and a later one. The first one would be a beta test
[13:35.880 --> 13:40.160]  just to train you to stay locked down. Then they would take the pressure off so the next
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.640]  time they could go even further and the next time. I figured out their exact blueprint from
[13:44.640 --> 13:52.480]  reading their own documents like lockstep. And now people go back to those clips, 2011,
[13:52.480 --> 13:58.520]  and their mouths are hanging open because exactly what I said happened. Well, it's not
[13:58.520 --> 14:03.080]  hard. Again, these people were bank robbers that were planning to rob a bank next Friday
[14:03.080 --> 14:10.840]  and the bank robbers my next door neighbor and he forgets and drops in his front yard
[14:10.840 --> 14:22.920]  a two-page plan to rob the bank down the street and it blows into my yard. And I read it and
[14:22.920 --> 14:26.520]  I'm not sure where it came from, but a week later that bank gets robbed. I know my neighbor
[14:26.520 --> 14:37.520]  or somebody around me robbed the bank. Well, it's the same thing with these people. It's
[14:37.520 --> 14:46.520]  like if a football team just left in the bleachers their playbook. And you know, the NFL, they
[14:46.520 --> 14:50.440]  go and spy on each other and steal each other's playbooks and the rest of it's really dirty.
[14:50.440 --> 14:54.280]  But then you know how to win the game because you've got the playbook. Ladies and gentlemen,
[14:54.280 --> 15:02.120]  we've got the playbook. We have the New World Order playbook, damn it. And that's why they
[15:02.120 --> 15:08.240]  want to software because if people just listen to us, it's game over. That's why M4 Wars
[15:08.240 --> 15:17.600]  is beyond important. And that's why it's so important to support the broadcast. If you
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.280]  want this broadcast to continue, don't believe their lies that we've got plenty of money.
[15:21.280 --> 15:25.640]  That's not true. And believe the guy that's told you the truth over and over again and
[15:25.640 --> 15:30.880]  go to saveinfoowars.com because I'm having to pay 40% of the bankruptcy and the civil
[15:30.880 --> 15:35.760]  lawsuits out of the money. I keep this place going indefinitely, but not if I got to pay
[15:35.760 --> 15:39.800]  the legal bills. So I need your help. I need everybody to go to saveinfoowars.com right
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.800]  now and make a donation. I think those that made donations will keep us on air. It'll
[15:44.800 --> 15:48.120]  cost me to go through this finish of this trial, the next trial and the appeals, at
[15:48.120 --> 15:53.800]  least a half a million dollars. And I don't have it. I need your support. Saveinfoowars.com
[15:53.800 --> 16:00.200]  and the big sales going at infowarstore.com. X3 back in stock. We'll be right back.
[16:00.200 --> 16:07.040]  Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.920]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together. This family
[16:11.920 --> 16:18.800]  that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[16:18.800 --> 16:26.480]  Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[16:26.480 --> 16:32.720]  firing up their main base to defeat the new world order. The only reason humanity is still
[16:32.720 --> 16:38.240]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken
[16:38.240 --> 16:44.680]  action and supported this show. I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.400]  info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up. Without your support

[17:23.360 --> 17:27.320]  reached the point that I can't pay them. Now I need your support. So if you want to keep

[20:00.480 --> 20:06.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:13.680 --> 20:17.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday emergency edition. Every broadcast is an
[20:17.440 --> 20:24.960]  emergency now because we're inside the permanent New World Order emergency. The globalist emergency.
[20:24.960 --> 20:31.440]  Journalist George Ellison will be joining us from Ukraine for about 30 minutes in the next
[20:31.440 --> 20:36.160]  hour to give us on the ground take on what's really happening with this precursor to what
[20:36.160 --> 20:40.080]  many experts believe could cause World War III. Then the father of the U.S. Chemical
[20:40.080 --> 20:47.200]  and Biological Weapons Treaty and Law. Francis Boyle has beyond bombshell information dealing
[20:47.200 --> 20:52.800]  with COVID-19 and what he says is coming next. And then Robert Barnes will be joining me in
[20:52.800 --> 21:01.280]  studio. I'll be hosting the fourth hour today. Now I've got loaded news here. Absolutely jam packed
[21:02.560 --> 21:06.880]  amounts of information and clips I want to get to.
[21:06.880 --> 21:12.000]  And I don't normally play a clip two days in a row, but I'm going to play this clip again.
[21:12.800 --> 21:22.000]  Everybody's seen countless compilations showing local news from different companies, CBS, NBC,
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.400]  ABC, Fox, all getting the same talking points and putting out the same message that mask
[21:28.400 --> 21:36.720]  protects you and the vaccines work and the Second Amendment's bad and all this type of garbage.
[21:36.720 --> 21:40.880]  There's a new compilation actually have several of them here where they're saying we need to
[21:40.880 --> 21:46.640]  shut down independent media. It's a threat to our democracy. Well, I don't have a teleprompter here.
[21:46.640 --> 21:52.560]  I'm not being told what to say. You have to judge me on the course of action and my history and
[21:52.560 --> 21:58.960]  am I more right than wrong? And the answer is right 95 plus percent of the time. And I'm going
[21:58.960 --> 22:03.040]  to attack by the establishment. The reason I'm going to first play this forehead all the other news
[22:03.760 --> 22:08.560]  is this is a perfect illustration of everything they're saying that we're doing
[22:10.080 --> 22:14.560]  is what they're doing. They're the threat to our freedom. They're the threat to the rule of the
[22:14.560 --> 22:23.040]  people. And they know that. But understand it's not just like everybody with who's an NBC affiliate
[22:23.040 --> 22:32.880]  gets this talking point. That's bad enough. Everybody that's an ABC or a CBS. It's all of them. Fox,
[22:32.880 --> 22:38.800]  CBS, ABC, NBC, the local Time Warner cable news channels they've got all over the country. They
[22:38.800 --> 22:46.400]  don't tell you they're CNN, but they're owned by the parent company and are produced by CNN. Total
[22:46.400 --> 22:53.920]  propaganda. In fact, the local Time Warner channels like one they have here in Austin are
[22:53.920 --> 22:59.840]  nothing but pure propaganda. Some local stations produce their own news. They go out and do maybe
[22:59.840 --> 23:06.080]  half the stuff is their original content. But many of these stations now are simply repeaters.
[23:06.080 --> 23:11.200]  And they repeat the message they're told, then they get the sponsorship and the government grants.
[23:12.160 --> 23:17.120]  I played a clip last night of a Bill Gates event where he had this comedian up there saying it's
[23:17.120 --> 23:21.360]  ridiculous. People claim when I worked for Obama, I was being paid to promote the Affordable Care
[23:21.360 --> 23:25.360]  Act. That's ridiculous. When you can go look at the federal records, he was paid to promote that.
[23:26.240 --> 23:32.560]  So they're training you and normalizing you to be able to lie to you. But also gaslight you.
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.680]  Where, yeah, we blew up the Nord Stream too. It's good. But if you say it, we're going to censor you.
[23:38.240 --> 23:44.160]  But you just admitted you did. Well, get used to it. See, that's next level mind control.
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.040]  So here's a clip dealing with the dying corporate repeater, parent,
[23:50.160 --> 23:56.240]  regurgitation media calling for all these diverse people to be censored. See, it wasn't just about
[23:56.240 --> 24:01.200]  Alex Jones four years ago. Not just about Donald Trump. It's about all of us. And that's why you
[24:01.200 --> 24:05.200]  exercising your freedom of speech, you sharing articles and videos, you producing your own show,
[24:05.200 --> 24:08.800]  even if it's low tech, it doesn't matter. You calling it a talk radio, you going to the state
[24:08.800 --> 24:13.280]  house, you going to speak at the city council is beyond important. It is absolutely essential.
[24:15.040 --> 24:21.200]  They want to silence you because the propaganda would not be necessary if the enemy was invincible.
[24:21.200 --> 24:25.200]  And they're far from invincible. They're a joke. Here's the latest clip.
[24:25.200 --> 24:31.360]  Fox and Antonio's Jessica Hedley and I'm Ryan Wolf. Our greatest responsibility is to serve our
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.160]  Treasure Valley communities, the old Paso Las Cruces communities, eastern Iowa communities,
[24:36.160 --> 24:41.280]  mid Michigan communities. We are extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that CBS4
[24:41.280 --> 24:46.080]  News produces. But we are concerned about the trouble that we're dealing with responsible
[24:46.080 --> 24:51.520]  one side of the story is playing our country, plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and
[24:51.520 --> 24:57.360]  false news has become all too common on social media, war alarming. Some media outlets publish
[24:57.360 --> 25:03.120]  these same fake stories without checking facts first. The sharing of biased and false news has
[25:03.120 --> 25:05.720]  has become all too common on social media.
[25:05.720 --> 25:08.520]  More alarmingly, some media has come to the end
[25:08.520 --> 25:10.120]  with a policy that they think they are
[25:10.120 --> 25:13.040]  effectively true without shaking past first.
[25:13.040 --> 25:15.520]  Unfortunately, some members of the U.S.
[25:15.520 --> 25:18.440]  have left force to push their own personal bias
[25:18.440 --> 25:21.720]  and agenda to control this exactly what people think.
[25:21.720 --> 25:24.720]  And this is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:24.720 --> 25:27.200]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:27.200 --> 25:29.640]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:29.640 --> 25:31.880]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:31.880 --> 25:34.320]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:34.320 --> 25:37.080]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:37.080 --> 25:39.880]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:39.880 --> 25:42.680]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:42.680 --> 25:45.120]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.320]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:48.320 --> 25:51.640]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:51.640 --> 25:54.040]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:54.040 --> 25:56.880]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:56.880 --> 25:59.320]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[25:59.320 --> 26:01.720]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.160]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[26:06.080 --> 26:07.920]  These people are extremely dangerous
[26:07.920 --> 26:10.040]  to all of our future freedom and health.
[26:10.040 --> 26:12.640]  That's why the big tech and big pharma
[26:12.640 --> 26:13.840]  could hit us with a bio weapon
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.080]  they admit is killing everybody.
[26:15.080 --> 26:16.680]  Mainstream news when we come back,
[26:16.680 --> 26:18.400]  because they have such a stranglehold,
[26:18.400 --> 26:21.560]  they thought they could get away with it, but they didn't.
[26:21.560 --> 26:24.160]  Thanks to this audience, thanks to the activist here,
[26:24.160 --> 26:26.000]  thanks to our guest.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  We are recognized even in a new Washington Post article
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.080]  as being the epicenter of the resistance
[26:31.080 --> 26:32.880]  of the poison shots.
[26:32.880 --> 26:34.240]  We're gonna save millions of lives,
[26:34.240 --> 26:36.000]  we're gonna bring these criminals to justice.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.960]  Now here's one dealing with the election
[26:37.960 --> 26:41.040]  of the new prime minister, who they hate so much,
[26:41.040 --> 26:44.280]  Georgia Maloney in Italy, totally scripted.
[26:44.280 --> 26:47.080]  Commits first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[26:47.080 --> 26:50.280]  A far-right leader said to take the lead in Italy
[26:50.280 --> 26:52.560]  for the first time since Benito Mussolini.
[26:52.560 --> 26:55.680]  The politics have been compared to that of Mussolini.
[26:55.680 --> 26:57.960]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[26:57.960 --> 27:00.720]  The first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[27:00.720 --> 27:03.360]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:03.360 --> 27:06.520]  First far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[27:06.520 --> 27:09.000]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.600]  The first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[27:12.600 --> 27:15.520]  The first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[27:15.520 --> 27:18.560]  The first leader from the far-right since Mussolini.
[27:18.560 --> 27:20.960]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:20.960 --> 27:24.040]  The first far-right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.880]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.800]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:27.800 --> 27:30.400]  The first far-right leader since Mussolini.
[27:30.400 --> 27:35.160]  First far right leader since Mussolini First far right leader since Mussolini
[27:35.160 --> 27:39.920]  First far right leader since Mussolini First far right leader since Mussolini
[27:39.920 --> 27:45.600]  First far right leader since Bonito Mussolini Most conservative prime minister since Mussolini
[27:45.600 --> 27:50.920]  Most far right leader since Bonito Mussolini Most far right leader since Bonito Mussolini
[27:50.920 --> 27:56.800]  It's furthest right since Bonito Mussolini It's furthest right since Bonito Mussolini
[27:56.800 --> 28:00.240]  The most far right leader since Benito Mussolini.
[28:00.240 --> 28:04.220]  The most far right prime minister since Mussolini.
[28:04.220 --> 28:08.940]  The most far right Italian prime minister since Benito Mussolini.
[28:08.940 --> 28:14.600]  The most far right prime minister since Mussolini.
[28:14.600 --> 28:19.800]  She's also set to become the most far right Italian Head of Government since Benito Mussolini.
[28:19.800 --> 28:23.040]  The most far right Italian Head of Government since Mussolini.
[28:23.040 --> 28:29.000]  The most far right head of Italian government, since Benito Mussolini,
[28:29.000 --> 28:33.000]  And the most far right Italian head of government, since Benito Mussolini,
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.980]  The most far right Italian head of government, since Benito Mussolini.
[28:35.980 --> 28:39.360]  The most far right Italian head of government, since bênito Mussolini,

[28:46.680 --> 28:50.180]  The most far right Italian head of government, since Benito Mussolini,
[28:50.180 --> 28:54.180]  and the most far-right Italian head of government since Mussolini
[28:54.180 --> 29:22.180]  Look around you. Everything I predicted from the Globlestone documents from their own admissions is now happening. Info wars credibility. My credibility has never been higher. And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air. But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight.
[29:24.180 --> 29:40.180]  Together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[29:40.180 --> 29:58.180]  So please visit saveinfowars.com. Saveinfowars.com where you can make straight donations, five, ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up. I'll never give in, but I could give out. Thank you for your support. Wouldn't be without you.
[29:58.180 --> 30:11.180]  Saveinfowars.com by the will of God and by God working through you and your support. Info wars continues to persevere against the attacks never before seen in the Western world. I can send up in media.
[30:11.180 --> 30:25.180]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight. And over the years, you have come to the table. You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars and free speech on the air. And I thank you. But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[30:25.180 --> 30:42.180]  I need your support. So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me this fight against the globalist, please visit saveinfowars.com. And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives and go for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[30:42.180 --> 31:00.180]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making is almost over. And right at the end, we're not giving up. We're not giving in, but we could give out. So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[31:00.180 --> 31:18.180]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist. I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but the world. We are engaging the globalist at point blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit.
[31:18.180 --> 31:35.180]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you have the success we're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[31:35.180 --> 31:52.180]  And that's why today it's more important than ever realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target.
[31:52.180 --> 32:06.180]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.

[33:00.480 --> 33:26.180]  So if you're going to carry out a biological chemical attack or a poison injection you
[33:26.180 --> 33:30.880]  got to silence people exposing it. The orders have gone on around the world to shut down
[33:30.880 --> 33:37.400]  the opposition. It's exposing this entire program and operation. They're all over the
[33:37.400 --> 33:43.120]  national and local news saying we're suing Alex Jones to silence them. It's not to do
[33:43.120 --> 33:47.720]  with these families. It's not to take your guns claiming people, you know, go out and
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.080]  discriminately kill kids. It's the same thing over and over again. Here's a clip of America's
[33:54.080 --> 34:02.840]  animation. I ask that with your verdict you not only take Alex Jones platform that he
[34:02.840 --> 34:10.560]  talks about away. I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform. That's what
[34:10.560 --> 34:20.400]  matters. Take him out of this discourse of this misinformation of this peddling of lies
[34:20.400 --> 34:32.480]  and make sure he can't do it again. That is punishment. That is deterrence. But somewhere
[34:32.480 --> 34:39.880]  out there right now is another day. Getting there for training for school. Fixing air
[34:39.880 --> 34:46.400]  marches. Going to work. They could not take care of it. And there could be a day when
[34:46.400 --> 34:50.600]  that child doesn't come home from school. And we know it's sad and that's reality. And
[34:50.600 --> 34:57.600]  the question is going to be where is Alex Jones when that happens? Is he in the studio?
[34:57.600 --> 35:10.800]  Get ready to bounce. Or will you stop him? That's going to be your case. And we get all
[35:10.800 --> 35:15.800]  done with all the others we're going to come back and re-assist. Because that's what justice
[35:15.800 --> 35:22.840]  is in this case. What do you think he deserves at the end of this road? To no longer be in
[35:22.840 --> 35:28.440]  public life. People have been like oh you're out to destroy Alex Jones. I don't want to
[35:28.440 --> 35:32.400]  destroy him. I don't care. If he wants to work at Safeway or manage a sprint store I don't
[35:32.400 --> 35:38.000]  care. I feel the right amount of justice is you should not be able to commercially market
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.280]  yourself as a public figure anymore. You should exit the American stage. That's what I think
[35:42.280 --> 35:46.320]  is the correct result. At least that's what I think is the most utilitarian good result.
[35:46.320 --> 35:50.640]  But the money is not even really the question for me. The question is will this suit be
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.960]  successful at stopping him from being on the national stage? And my worry is like we said
[35:54.960 --> 35:57.560]  in the courthouses it won't be because the cameras will still follow him. Like he can
[35:57.560 --> 36:00.840]  lose all of his money. He gets out there again on the bullhorn and he starts building it
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.720]  right back up. So the question is can this cause of action against Jones on behalf of
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.800]  these parents come to represent something bigger? Is it a bigger referendum on the false
[36:10.800 --> 36:16.760]  things he's saying? I hope so man. I hope so.
[36:16.760 --> 36:22.880]  The false news about a new world order or a world government forced injections. So somebody
[36:22.880 --> 36:26.920]  goes and shoots kids who's on Prozac. It's a gun illegally. And it's Remington's fault
[36:26.920 --> 36:31.000]  and they get $73 million. And then they say Jones can't put on evidence. We're gonna put
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.920]  on all our fake evidence. And then we're gonna have a jury find him guilty and then have
[36:34.920 --> 36:39.040]  these giant judgments which they'll never get because the money's not there. But it's
[36:39.040 --> 36:42.240]  really about something bigger. It's setting the precedent to decide what you can listen
[36:42.240 --> 36:45.440]  to and what you can watch. You can't make your own decisions. And it's about ultimately
[36:45.440 --> 36:52.240]  silencing us all so America can exit stage left.
[36:52.240 --> 37:00.120]  But do they talk about lying about WMDs in Iraq? Because Bush Sr. put horrible sanctions
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.320]  on the Iraqis and killed a couple hundred thousand of them. And it's estimated two million
[37:03.320 --> 37:07.040]  starved to death. A half a million of them children under Bill Clinton's tripling of
[37:07.040 --> 37:10.680]  the sanctions. And when Marilyn Albright, who they worshiped like a saint, like the
[37:10.680 --> 37:16.840]  Queen of England died, she had that five day funeral. Remember last year? When Marilyn
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.640]  Albright died, it was like God had died. Well, she said 500,000 kids dying is a good price
[37:22.640 --> 37:30.000]  to pay to take over Iraq. So they do whatever they want. They promote castrating children.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.720]  They promote the fentanyl. They promote the collapsing cities. They promote total war.
[37:33.720 --> 37:38.920]  They blow up pipelines. They start the beginning of World War Three. They lie about WMDs in
[37:38.920 --> 37:44.000]  Iraq. So they can go in there and squeeze them for decades and murder millions of them.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.240]  And they're angels. But oh, then the left, because I questioned Jesse Smaller WMDs in
[37:48.240 --> 37:54.160]  Iraq or mass shootings, a lot of which are very suspicious. I'm the bad guy. And then
[37:54.160 --> 37:59.720]  oh, because there's no evidence, Jones didn't get what we say, he can't put on evidence.
[37:59.720 --> 38:02.840]  But he's ordered to show up and testify in court. But the judge says, all these things
[38:02.840 --> 38:09.680]  I can't say, like I'm innocent or I didn't make money off Sandy Hook. Can't present
[38:09.680 --> 38:17.080]  my financials. No, we're just going to lie about you. They're murdering your due process.
[38:17.080 --> 38:21.200]  But I'm unlike the corporate media. When I make a claim that somebody said something
[38:21.200 --> 38:25.080]  or did something, I show it to you. Like earlier, I showed you the Secretary of State's thing.
[38:25.080 --> 38:29.920]  It's a great thing this pipeline's blown up. And Biden's saying, we'll get rid of the
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.480]  pipeline. Don't you worry, Victoria Newland, I show it to you. Here's Madeleine Albright
[38:34.480 --> 38:42.800]  licking her vampire lips. We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean,
[38:42.800 --> 38:50.600]  that's more children than died when went in Hiroshima. And you know, is the price worth
[38:50.600 --> 38:58.160]  it? I think this is a very hard choice. But the price we think the price is worth it.
[38:58.160 --> 39:04.400]  The price of their power, the price of what they want to do, your farms, your businesses,
[39:04.400 --> 39:08.840]  your children, your biological freedom, the autonomy of your own body, it's okay because
[39:08.840 --> 39:15.440]  they have a dream. They have a program. They have a plan for you. And they can't have us
[39:15.440 --> 39:20.360]  up here with our free speech because we told you the shots didn't work. We told you they
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.240]  gave you blood clots. We told you they cause infertility and cancer because the government's
[39:24.240 --> 39:32.040]  own documents in October of 2000 and we had top scientists on 95% of what we say is dead
[39:32.040 --> 39:37.040]  on ladies and gentlemen, and they can't stand it. So here's the Daily Mail. AstraZeneca,
[39:37.040 --> 39:41.760]  the third biggest so-called vaccine maker did the exact same thing. Gates gave the orders.
[39:41.760 --> 39:47.240]  Same thing as the Pfizer Moderna creates spike protein in the body. AstraZeneca uncovers trigger
[39:47.240 --> 39:53.000]  a blood clots after its injection. AstraZeneca uncovers what's triggering blood clots after
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.640]  its jab. Vaccine acts like a magnet, like we told you two and a half years ago. Yeah,
[39:58.640 --> 40:04.360]  it's graphene oxide and attracts platelets which the body mistakes for a threat and attacks
[40:04.360 --> 40:12.040]  it, eating holes in the arteries and other blood vessels. And that's AstraZeneca going,
[40:12.040 --> 40:19.320]  oh, guess what? Kind of like Vioxx. We killed your ass. Meanwhile, we've got this big study.
[40:19.320 --> 40:24.720]  A new one came out, but here's one of 2012. In a 2012 study, 99% of breast cancer samples
[40:24.720 --> 40:31.440]  and lives contain paradigms, a common carcinogenic ingredient found in deodorants. It goes right
[40:31.440 --> 40:36.080]  into your breast and gives you cancer. They're doing it on purpose. Oh, here's another one,
[40:36.080 --> 40:44.640]  MSN.com. Scientists trick mosquitoes in delivering vaccines to humans. Biden thanks Coast Guard
[40:44.640 --> 40:52.680]  Diver for saving lives in Florida. Plans to hire him in days over Vaxman Day. Biden thanks
[40:52.680 --> 40:58.040]  Coast Guard Diver for saving lives in Florida. Plans to fire him. I said, hire him out of
[40:58.040 --> 41:04.640]  Forty and Slip. Plans to fire him in days over Vaxman Day. Why won't the Canadian Medical
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.520]  Association comment on 32 deaths of vaccinated doctors, most of them very young, since the
[41:09.520 --> 41:18.320]  rollout of heart attacks. It's normal to have 30-year-old doctors having heart attacks. It's the new normal.
[41:18.320 --> 41:23.080]  That my friends is brainwashing. That my friends is mind control. We're going to go to break
[41:23.080 --> 41:29.920]  and shift gears into replacement migration and into the situation in Ukraine and the
[41:29.920 --> 41:35.520]  economy and new pandemics. The globalists are preparing and engineering and so much
[41:35.520 --> 41:41.480]  more on this emergency Monday broadcast. But you just heard the enemies of free speech
[41:41.480 --> 41:46.920]  say, our job is to shut him down. Our job is to silence him. Well, as long as we get
[41:46.920 --> 41:51.880]  funds in and we have a goal we've got to hit, we'll make it through Chapter 5 bankruptcy.
[41:51.880 --> 41:55.760]  This company will continue on. We'll have several years of appeals and we will not be
[41:55.760 --> 42:01.120]  shut down. But if you don't support the broadcast by buying products at inforwarstore.com, they
[42:01.120 --> 42:08.080]  will get what they want. So we're on the knife's edge here. The bat signal's fired. We've got

[43:11.960 --> 43:18.840]  that is InfoWars. Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and
[43:18.840 --> 43:26.520]  Ball Sonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards
[43:26.520 --> 43:32.800]  firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order. The only reason humanity is still
[43:32.800 --> 43:38.960]  in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action

[46:01.280 --> 46:08.760]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist. I have come from nowhere to the
[46:08.760 --> 46:14.600]  very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world. We are engaging the globalist
[46:14.600 --> 46:19.880]  at point-blank range in the information war. But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've
[46:19.880 --> 46:25.080]  persevered. But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason you've
[46:25.080 --> 46:30.760]  had this success. We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[46:30.760 --> 46:38.200]  you've ever had. We are now entering the final mile of the marathon. And that's why today
[46:38.200 --> 46:41.760]  it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to
[46:41.760 --> 46:46.920]  continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all.
[46:46.920 --> 46:52.320]  I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we
[46:52.320 --> 46:57.160]  are over the target and this streak is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's
[46:57.160 --> 47:00.800]  our fight. God bless you all.
[47:00.800 --> 47:28.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones. We've got
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.320]  three big guests coming up in the next three hours. We're hosting all four hours today.
[47:32.320 --> 47:41.240]  We're now 47 minutes into this, verboten. We're a side of non-grata transmission. So
[47:41.240 --> 47:48.960]  if you go back two years ago, Sasha Bericoen, Mr. Anti-Free Speech was at the ADL Summit
[47:48.960 --> 47:55.360]  in D.C. And he said we need to arrest Alex Jones. He said we need to arrest Mark Zuckerberg
[47:55.360 --> 48:00.040]  because he won't fully turn control of Facebook over to the ADL. He actually said it. They
[48:00.040 --> 48:04.360]  put on an official policy report. Then two weeks ago they had a summit the ADL did at
[48:04.360 --> 48:09.040]  the Winehouse and called for arresting anybody they disagree with. I mean, this is some dangerous
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.320]  folks. Most of the things at Nazis I've seen in my lifetime. Oh, my grandfather's thought
[48:15.320 --> 48:20.680]  Hitler, we dealt with that. But if you look at how they cut the resources off the Third
[48:20.680 --> 48:25.320]  World, collapse things that have UN refugee centers flooding us with third world populations,
[48:25.320 --> 48:29.640]  then when they get here, they say, oh, whether you're in the U.S. or whether you're in Germany,
[48:29.640 --> 48:35.500]  they go, oh, we're going to have quotas not just for brown people to get the jobs, which
[48:35.500 --> 48:42.000]  is fine if you've got the resume in the background. I don't care what color you are. But because
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.400]  you're a quote migrant, now that's replacement migration being forced. What do the people
[48:48.400 --> 48:58.240]  do that get fired? Remember? Minneapolis came out a month ago and said we're going to fire
[48:58.240 --> 49:04.160]  white teachers. Well, that's really friendly. That's not discrimination. Germany, Greens
[49:04.160 --> 49:11.120]  plan to ban native Germans from a third of jobs, promote diversity. They've got the votes.
[49:11.120 --> 49:16.240]  The name of promoting diversity ruling greens in Germany, the city of Hanover plan to ban
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.760]  a third of native citizens from applying for government jobs so they can be given to migrants.
[49:20.760 --> 49:27.080]  So if you happen to be of African descent or Arabic descent or Asian descent or Native
[49:27.080 --> 49:32.120]  American descent, whatever reason, maybe you, maybe your father or grandfather was a GI
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.960]  in Germany, decided to stay there, got your mother pregnant, your grandmother, you live
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.840]  in Germany, you're a German citizen. Doesn't matter. You got brown skin. You don't get
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.320]  a job because you're native born. See as a magnet to pull the third world population
[49:47.320 --> 49:54.560]  in. So they don't want you discussing that. Race-based politics. But here's the original
[49:54.560 --> 50:01.400]  UN plan from 2002. UN migration pack crumbles as attention drawn to disturbing replacement
[50:01.400 --> 50:09.800]  migration plan on the UN website, which Saucer Bear Cohen says arrest anyone talking about
[50:09.800 --> 50:19.320]  it. He's not a tyrant. He's a nice man. Here's another one. Kamala Harris says by administration
[50:19.320 --> 50:27.200]  will focus on giving hurricane relief resources based on equality and equity, equity to communities
[50:27.200 --> 50:31.440]  of color. Just getting that idea out there. The government decides who gets what, then
[50:31.440 --> 50:37.760]  they can control you. But Bill Clinton wants to play the good cop. He says there's a limit
[50:37.760 --> 50:45.320]  to how many migrants any society can take without severe disruption. And that's a playbook
[50:45.320 --> 50:49.000]  that once they disrupt, once they break things down, once they give you a poison shot, they
[50:49.000 --> 50:57.600]  let a report on the poison shot and act like they're sad for it. Remember Joe Biden last
[50:57.600 --> 51:02.640]  week, mass immigration, changing demographics, making America so much better. Yeah, all the
[51:02.640 --> 51:11.960]  homeless shelters completely filled. Germany introduced a green card to bolster workforce.
[51:11.960 --> 51:16.480]  It goes on and on and on. And then we have this video. And you know, I didn't see it
[51:16.480 --> 51:21.480]  in my list. So maybe you guys can grab it or maybe it's on the list and I miss it. But
[51:21.480 --> 51:25.520]  I send the folks this list every morning. And it's an incredible video. Well, we could
[51:25.520 --> 51:36.400]  talk about four hours about just this. Just this 43 second video. We have it. Well, good
[51:36.400 --> 51:43.680]  job, crew. Now, funny, I got a five year old World Economic Forum video saying soon you'll
[51:43.680 --> 51:47.920]  own nothing and have nothing. I had another four year old video saying soon you'll only
[51:47.920 --> 51:53.080]  eat bugs. Beef won't be available. People laugh at it. Oh, yeah, right. Sure. Oh, it's
[51:53.080 --> 51:58.040]  going to shut down all the ranches. You're like, Oh, people still own the ranch. Oh,
[51:58.040 --> 52:03.960]  the meat backers won't take the meat. This is a takeover. This is war. This is a total
[52:03.960 --> 52:08.080]  shutdown of society and the synthetic garbage they're going to forcibly feed you. This is
[52:08.080 --> 52:13.760]  called being a slave. World Economic Forum just announced that your bank accounts will
[52:13.760 --> 52:20.040]  be frozen due to climate change. Now, what I cover last week, India's having a 20 day
[52:20.040 --> 52:25.640]  bank holiday to bring in a new digital currency. They're announcing these new digital programmable
[52:25.640 --> 52:38.640]  central bank digital currencies, central bank digital currencies, SBDCs that control everything
[52:38.640 --> 52:43.320]  you do, where you go, how you can operate. And now they're telling you, Oh, mass blackouts
[52:43.320 --> 52:46.600]  are coming. Mass power outages are coming. Oh, it's not because we shut off all the power
[52:46.600 --> 52:51.600]  plants. It's the Russians. And then they, it's the Russians whoop the pipeline and they
[52:51.600 --> 52:57.240]  shut down the Keystone pipeline too. And they flood us with fentanyl. And when you slipped
[52:57.240 --> 53:05.160]  on that banana peel, it was the Russians. So now they're saying extreme weather, because
[53:05.160 --> 53:10.200]  you're not going to have any power in Europe this winter. They said, Well, that's why you're
[53:10.200 --> 53:13.920]  not going to be able to spend your money, but we've got a new digital currency that'll
[53:13.920 --> 53:19.120]  be better. So they always tell you what they're about to do to you right before they do it.
[53:19.120 --> 53:31.200]  It's totally and completely scripted. So folks, if you thought it was going to be bad, if
[53:31.200 --> 53:37.840]  you thought double digit inflation was terrible, well, imagine the wonders of having your bank
[53:37.840 --> 53:42.040]  account frozen. And then when it's unfrozen, suddenly your money has a new value, but they've
[53:42.040 --> 53:45.440]  already siphoned it off. That's what they do in all the third world countries during
[53:45.440 --> 53:50.580]  inflation is they have bank holidays. And now, oh, it's global warming. Oh, there's a deadly
[53:50.580 --> 53:54.240]  virus they released because of global warming. Oh, the third world's collapsing, not from
[53:54.240 --> 53:58.200]  lockdowns, but because of global warming. Oh, your bank account got devalued because
[53:58.200 --> 54:03.200]  of global warming. Oh, and the sea level is rising. That's why they're all buying houses
[54:03.200 --> 54:06.400]  on the beach. It's not rising. Here's a clip.
[54:06.400 --> 54:12.720]  It started over. I want to be able to read it for people because I forgot. We have radio
[54:12.720 --> 54:17.760]  listeners. They won't be able to read. This is a text only video. Roll it again. One of
[54:17.760 --> 54:23.240]  extreme weather froze your bank account. The world's digital financial systems are increasingly
[54:23.240 --> 54:35.080]  interconnected. Companies have come to rely on one another. The network of critical interdependencies.
[54:35.080 --> 54:43.120]  This means disruption can more easily grow and spread throughout the system was repercussions
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.320]  that could affect us all. It means that a severe snowstorm, for example, or a cyber
[54:49.320 --> 54:58.000]  attack could cut off people's access to money, both in person and online. A situation that
[54:58.000 --> 55:02.280]  could lead to widespread panic and loss of trust, which is what they want the old system
[55:02.280 --> 55:09.800]  to feel back better. An average cyber ripple event impacts 10 additional companies beyond
[55:09.800 --> 55:16.280]  the firm's originally affected. Last year's cyber attack on U.S. software company, Solar
[55:16.280 --> 55:23.040]  Winds, highlighted the risk of interconnectedness.
[55:23.040 --> 55:28.000]  So let me decode this really quick and simply. I know you already figured it out, but the
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.640]  headlines everywhere in the last month were the end of globalism, the end of global interconnectedness.
[55:34.640 --> 55:38.680]  So they got us all interconnected and dependent on each other to then hijack us and enslave
[55:38.680 --> 55:44.640]  us and control us while they consolidate control. The end of globalization was always the beginning
[55:44.640 --> 55:49.360]  of globalism where everybody else has their resources cut off and only compact globalist
[55:49.360 --> 55:54.200]  high-tech city-states have fuel and energy and transport. Everybody else is in the Hunger
[55:54.200 --> 56:01.240]  Games. I told you this 20-plus years ago, now it's here. It's in my film Endgame. It's
[56:01.240 --> 56:08.240]  free online for God's sakes. I know it's not Pearls Before Swine, because it got 85 million
[56:08.240 --> 56:12.120]  views where they took it off Google Video, and that went away 15 years ago, 14 years
[56:12.120 --> 56:15.920]  ago. Tens of millions of views since, but it needs hundreds of millions of views. It
[56:15.920 --> 56:21.200]  needs billions of views. And if you get excited about Endgame and find the links and clips,
[56:21.200 --> 56:26.680]  there's a copy on Band-Op Video. We'll change the world if you don't, we're screwed. So
[56:26.680 --> 56:31.800]  they're getting you ready for this and the insecurity and the angrier world and the riots
[56:31.800 --> 56:35.440]  and the control. We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen. We're going to continue
[56:35.440 --> 56:39.640]  to broadcast through this as long as we can, and we will never back down in the face of
[56:39.640 --> 56:44.640]  prison threats and personal attacks and dirty tricks and everything else. But if I'm not
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.440]  backed by you, I can't do it. People notice the urgency here, because we've pushed so
[56:50.440 --> 56:55.320]  far and gotten so deep into this, and we've been saved so many times by great folks. But
[56:55.320 --> 57:00.640]  whether you make a $10 donation or a $1,000 donation in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,
[57:00.640 --> 57:06.200]  you should go now to infowars.com forward slash crypto and make a donation. You should go to
[57:06.200 --> 57:10.120]  save infowars.com if you want to fund the fact that I've got to fund 40% of the legal

[58:00.880 --> 58:06.200]  because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship

[58:18.520 --> 58:23.560]  me on the air. In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm
[58:23.560 --> 58:28.120]  being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund
[58:28.120 --> 58:36.920]  those myself. It's unsustainable. So please visit saveinfowars.com. Saveinfowars.com where

[59:56.120 --> 1:00:03.120]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:10.960]  It's a young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of his cabinet, are actually
[1:00:10.960 --> 1:00:18.840]  young nobilities of the world. So if we penetrate the cabinet, the change is not just happening.
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:27.360]  The change can be shaped by us. We have to prepare for a more angry world, how to prepare
[1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:35.120]  to take the necessary action to create the fair world. I see the need for a great reset.
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:40.680]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world, which we had and everything
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:48.200]  will be normal again. This is, let's say, it will not happen. There is only one way
[1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:53.760]  this pandemic is going to get worse and worse and worse.
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:01:01.600]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack,
[1:01:01.600 --> 1:01:10.200]  which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services.
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:19.600]  All society has a hold. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:28.600]  disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[1:01:28.600 --> 1:01:43.440]  Why don't we talk about cryptocurrency? Because one of the ways that you encourage your audience
[1:01:43.440 --> 1:01:49.600]  to give you money is in cryptocurrency donations. And you have a page on your website that is
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:51.600]  just for cryptocurrency donations.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:59.600]  We are fighting the deep state. We need money.
[1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:06.600]  This is it. Give crypto fun info wars. Sponsor us with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
[1:02:06.600 --> 1:02:17.600]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight. You know, people want to keep us in the fight.
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:21.600]  So I hope wherever the big whales are, they will give us money before we keep doing it.
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:27.600]  We will just keep minting money as early as this courtroom.
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:48.600]  When you have US senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do? Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[1:02:48.600 --> 1:03:01.600]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine. I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert. Only one level above that on their death con, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:08.600]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:20.600]  When you think of their ignorance, Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:30.600]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5. Land launch systems that can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:39.600]  And yes, the United States has those too. That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have. It's on record the US has those systems.
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:49.600]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[1:03:49.600 --> 1:04:00.600]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war, especially when Russia is not starting a fight with us, and especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[1:04:00.600 --> 1:04:23.600]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:56.600]  Think about a world without info.
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:11.600]  Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:27.600]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:37.600]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:45.600]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit. And now info wars is facing its darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.
[1:05:45.600 --> 1:06:07.600]  Without your support, we can be shut down. Please go to saveinfowars.com today. Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[1:06:07.600 --> 1:06:18.600]  You are listening to an info wars dot com front line report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:27.600]  And we are back on this live October 3rd, Monday Transmission. We have three huge guests coming up, the first of in about 15 minutes.
[1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:35.600]  But let's just race through news that all ties together here. This is going to be quite the news blitz in this 10 minute segment.
[1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:41.600]  Here's the headline. And it's being echoed everywhere in corporate establishment media.
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:48.600]  If you liked inflation is good for you, then you're going to love nuclear war is good for you.
[1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:58.600]  Could a small nuclear war reverse global warming? Nuclear war could reverse global warming by putting dust in the air to cause a new ice age and lots of radiation death.
[1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:09.600]  Well, that just sounds really fun from the Huffington Post. Could a small nuclear war reverse global warming? Nuclear war is a bad thing. No, it's good.
[1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:15.600]  Okay, so pedophilia is good too, right? Open borders is good too, right?
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:18.600]  Oh, it sounds bad, right? The media told me.
[1:07:18.600 --> 1:07:24.600]  Globalists are marching us relentlessly towards nuclear Armageddon warns former senator.
[1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:29.600]  Not wise to let Ukraine join NATO. Kissinger threatens all out war.
[1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:35.600]  Even Henry Kissinger, even the Pope doesn't want it. What if we're already fighting the Third World War with Russia?
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.600]  Excellent article from New Yorker magazine. Yes, we already are.
[1:07:39.600 --> 1:07:48.600]  Exclusive FDA withholding autopsy results of people who died after getting COVID-19 vaccines. How loving the epic times.
[1:07:48.600 --> 1:08:01.600]  And it goes on and on and on. YouTube is censoring and shutting down video compilations of Democrats denying 2016 election results because you're not allowed to question elections.
[1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:06.600]  It just goes on and on and on.
[1:08:06.600 --> 1:08:13.600]  And I mentioned this earlier, but here it is. What if extreme weather froze your bank account?
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:18.600]  The World Economic Forum says get ready for all your bank accounts to be shut down.
[1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:25.600]  And don't worry, they said when the old system goes down, they've got a new digital currency that tracks you and controls you ready.
[1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:28.600]  2023 will be the year from hell.
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:34.600]  Pop Financial Analysts warns Europe could suck the rest of the world down the tubes.
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:37.600]  I don't think it could. I think it has.
[1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:43.600]  After they blew up, the Nord Stream and one is going blown up too.
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:51.600]  It's doesn't working now. See, that's got holes all in in the US controlled area of the pipeline.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  They took control area.
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:09:02.600]  A giant screw you to taxpayers Fauci and his pal Peter Dazik is awarded new government NIH contract to study back coronaviruses like they did before.
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:08.600]  But it wasn't them that made it, even though they admittedly made it, it was global warming. It was your fault.
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:12.600]  Gas starts flowing to Poland via the new Baltic pipeline.
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:16.600]  Zero hedge reports the day the Nord Stream was blown up.
[1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.600]  Oh, how liberal.
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:25.600]  But that's okay because Bill Gates has engineered mosquitoes that forcibly inject you with vaccines.
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:28.600]  That's from bgr.com.
[1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:37.600]  Pfizer CEO pulls out of testifying to EU Parliament when it turned out he illegally paid off EU leaders to bypass human trials.
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:46.600]  Total criminal activity.
[1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.600]  We are living in quite a world right now.
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:55.600]  I mentioned this, but here it is bank holiday October 2022.
[1:09:55.600 --> 1:10:02.600]  Banks remain closed for 21 days in India and suddenly other countries are announcing in October, November.
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  They're going to lock down and the WEF told you it's coming. How liberal.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:12.600]  But it's global warming. Oh, okay.
[1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:19.600]  That's the reality of what we are facing.
[1:10:19.600 --> 1:10:24.600]  Sweden removes recommendation on general vaccination against COVID-19.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:30.600]  For ages 12 to 17, citing heart attacks, microcarditis and blood clots.
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  Wow, mainstream news.
[1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:39.600]  Isn't that interesting?
[1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  But let's shift gear to their other big attack.
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:53.600]  They've opened thousands of transitioning clinics and 300 surgery centers funded by the biggest corporations.
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:11:00.600]  And it turns out that in Europe and the US and the UK and Australia and New Zealand, it's all unified program.
[1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:16.600]  They're taking mentally retarded and autistic children, boys and girls and convincing them to sign pieces of paper between ages 7 and 12 to have their testicles, penises and breasts cut off.
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:25.600]  And we have the famous video, The Big Professor, up there at a big symposium saying we're making huge profits.
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:31.600]  Yeah, get the clip ready. We're making huge profits, mainly cutting little girls' breasts off.
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.600]  So if you go to the doctor and say I want my finger cut off, they call a patty wagon.
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  They go to the mental institution. But if you want your breast or penis cut off, my goodness, that's trendy.
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:42.600]  We want to be politically correct. We want to support that.
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:47.600]  Highly profitable pediatric gender clinics are opening up across the country.
[1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:52.600]  300 for sex changes.
[1:11:52.600 --> 1:11:57.600]  Here's the highly profitable clip.
[1:11:57.600 --> 1:12:13.600]  Starting in January 1st of 2017, according to the Affordable Care Act, insurance carriers are mandated to cover medical expenses for trans folks.
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:19.600]  Some of our BUMC financial folks in October of 2016 started a couple years ago put down some costs of how much money we think each patient would bring in.
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  And this is only including top surgery. This doesn't include any bottom surgery. And it's a lot of money. These surgeries make a lot of money.
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:34.600]  So female to male and chest reconstruction can bring in $40,000.
[1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:42.600]  A patient just got a routine hormone treatment, who I've only seen a few times a year, can bring in several thousand dollars because they require a lot of visits and lab.
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:45.600]  It actually makes money for the hospital.
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:55.600]  That's the head of the Vanderbilt Gender Affirming Care Unit saying we're making lots of money shopping little girls' breasts and little boys' penises and testicles off.
[1:12:55.600 --> 1:13:03.600]  But California just signed a law last week to ship kids as young as 10 in from around the country without parental consent to chop their breasts off.
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  You know, when Jeffrey Dahmer cut men's penises off, he was evil and a serial killer.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  But when Governor Newsom does it, it's liberal.
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  California just made it legal for minors to travel there from other states to get cross-sex drugs and surgery without parents' consent.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  And all over liberal-controlled areas like California and New York, parents aren't told when their kindergartners are taught they're another sex.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:32.600]  But don't worry, the U.S. Army's on board.
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:40.600]  The U.S. Army falls 25% short of recruiting goals despite offering pre-sex changes and critical race theory.
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:43.600]  That's how you sabotage the human military.
[1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:50.600]  Let's play a clip from 1979, Life of Brian, where Monty Python was being absurd, but now it's reality.
[1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:53.600]  Why are you always on about women, Stan?
[1:13:53.600 --> 1:13:56.600]  I want to be one.
[1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:58.600]  What?
[1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:00.600]  I want to be a woman.
[1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:05.600]  From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.
[1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:06.600]  What?
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:08.600]  It's my right as a man.
[1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:12.600]  Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:15.600]  I want to have babies.
[1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:17.600]  You want to have babies?
[1:14:17.600 --> 1:14:20.600]  It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
[1:14:20.600 --> 1:14:22.600]  But you can't have babies.
[1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:23.600]  Don't you oppress me?
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:26.600]  Oh, no, I'm pressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb.
[1:14:26.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  Where's the fetus going to gestate? You're going to keep it in a box?
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:39.600]  Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies,
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:42.600]  not having a womb, which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans,
[1:14:42.600 --> 1:14:45.600]  but that he can have the right to have babies.
[1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:47.600]  Good idea, Judith.
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.600]  We shall fight the oppressors for your right to have babies, brother.
[1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:51.600]  Sister, sorry?
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:53.600]  What's the point?
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:54.600]  What?
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:15:00.600]  What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?
[1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:06.600]  What is symbolic of our struggle against oppression?
[1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:09.600]  Symbolic of his struggle against reality.
[1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  Because they are struggling against reality,
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:16.600]  and they want the precedent to go in and destroy innocence in children
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:21.600]  and form a sick, evil, corporate relationship with them.
[1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:23.600]  This is beyond pedophilia.
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:28.600]  It's horrible enough to molest or hurt a child or rape a child
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.600]  for the innocence of their freedom and their future.
[1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  But to cut their genitals or breast off is an act of satanic sacrifice,
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:36.600]  and it's out in the open.
[1:15:36.600 --> 1:15:39.600]  You ask, how do the Aztecs sacrifice? How are the Babylonians?
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:40.600]  How are the Druids?
[1:15:40.600 --> 1:15:43.600]  Well, you see now they're doing it.
[1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:46.600]  They know you'll reject outright sacrifice.
[1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:49.600]  So instead, we sacrifice their identity
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:53.600]  and their ability to have children,
[1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  and create what we're about to do.
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:26.600]  To help keep me on the air.
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:29.600]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[1:16:29.600 --> 1:16:31.600]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:33.600]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[1:16:33.600 --> 1:16:35.600]  and I can't fund those myself.
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:36.600]  It's unsustainable.
[1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:41.600]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com.

[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.600]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:16:52.600 --> 1:16:53.600]  Thank you for your support.
[1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:54.600]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:03.600]  InfoWars continues to persevere
[1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:05.600]  against attacks never before seen
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:07.600]  in the Western world against independent media.
[1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:09.600]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:11.600]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[1:17:11.600 --> 1:17:13.600]  You have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:16.600]  and kept InfoWars in free speech on the air,
[1:17:16.600 --> 1:17:17.600]  and I thank you.
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:19.600]  But now, I have my own legal bills
[1:17:19.600 --> 1:17:21.600]  that have reached the point that I can't pay them,
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:22.600]  and I need your support.
[1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:25.600]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:28.600]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists,
[1:17:28.600 --> 1:17:31.600]  please visit SaveInfoWars.com.
[1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:34.600]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL
[1:17:34.600 --> 1:17:38.600]  that gives SINGO for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:41.600]  This whole phase of their attacks,
[1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:43.600]  four years in the making, is almost over.
[1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:45.600]  And right at the end, we're not giving up,
[1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:47.600]  we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:49.600]  So please, if you support what we're doing
[1:17:49.600 --> 1:17:51.600]  and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:17:56.600]  and just in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[1:17:56.600 --> 1:18:01.600]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[1:18:01.600 --> 1:18:05.600]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:08.600]  not just in America, but in the world.
[1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:11.600]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[1:18:11.600 --> 1:18:13.600]  in the information war.
[1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:15.600]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:18.600]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:20.600]  who support InfoWars are the real reason
[1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  you've had the success.
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:24.600]  We're having now the greatest victories
[1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:27.600]  in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.600]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[1:18:32.600 --> 1:18:35.600]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.600]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:40.600]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:41.600]  and to intensify it.
[1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:42.600]  God bless you all.
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:43.600]  I salute you.
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:44.600]  I thank you.
[1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:47.600]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:50.600]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:52.600]  The fight is my fight.
[1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:53.600]  It's your fight.
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:54.600]  It's our fight.
[1:18:54.600 --> 1:19:23.600]  Thank you all.
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:26.600]  Thank you.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:01.600]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:30.600]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:50.600]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:56.600]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday broadcast.
[1:20:56.600 --> 1:20:59.600]  And to say that the world is in an emergency
[1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:00.600]  is an understatement.
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:02.600]  We have the Secretary of State basically admitting
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:03.600]  they blew up the pipeline.
[1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:05.600]  We have Biden bragging about it.
[1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:08.600]  We have Victoria Newland doing it.
[1:21:08.600 --> 1:21:10.600]  We have Russia calling up 300,000 troops.
[1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:13.600]  This whole thing is escalating very, very quickly.
[1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:15.600]  Even Henry Kissinger is calling for peace.
[1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.600]  So is the Pope.
[1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:21.600]  And now Europe is going to be hurtled into a depression,
[1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:23.600]  which will probably suck the entire world into it.
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:26.600]  Most economists are predicting.
[1:21:26.600 --> 1:21:27.600]  And they're just going to blame Russia.
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:28.600]  And I'm not a Russophile,
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:30.600]  but I'm not an enemy of Russia either.
[1:21:30.600 --> 1:21:33.600]  And I realize Western elites want global domination.
[1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:39.600]  When they get up there and say that Putin wants an imperial takeover,
[1:21:39.600 --> 1:21:42.600]  boy, that is the pot calling the kettle black.
[1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:44.600]  George Eliason is an American journalist
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:47.600]  who lives and works in Donbass, Ukraine.
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:49.600]  They said the big referendum's there.
[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:53.600]  2014, he wrote many of the stories starting with what happened
[1:21:53.600 --> 1:21:57.600]  with the beginning of the Civil War, TNT Radio Live.
[1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  I'm not going to read his whole bio or about his blogs.
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:03.600]  He's been interviewed by everybody from RT to BBC to Press TV
[1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:06.600]  and countless other publications.
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:10.600]  And he joins us now to give us a summation of what he believes is happening,
[1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:14.600]  what he's actually witnessing and where he thinks this proxy war
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:17.600]  now metastasizing to a full bore continental war is going.
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:21.600]  So thank you very much, George.
[1:22:21.600 --> 1:22:23.600]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:25.600]  All right. I'm going to try to shut up because I can talk a lot.
[1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.600]  You want to start in details?
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:29.600]  You want to start with a big picture, 35,000-foot view?
[1:22:29.600 --> 1:22:32.600]  Where do you want to begin? You've got the floor.
[1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:36.600]  Okay. Well, let's start with that, the 35,000-foot view.
[1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:43.600]  We're looking at a situation where Ukraine has been more or less a Petru dish.
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:45.600]  And you can't consider it anything more than that.
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:50.600]  It's the laboratory for what they want to do to the rest of the world.
[1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:56.600]  Last January, I wrote an article in Modern Diplomacy
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:00.600]  that outlined what they'd done in Ukraine with the economy,
[1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:06.600]  crashing it, destroying any hope Ukraine had for a future.
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:11.600]  And when they did that, they raised gas prices worldwide
[1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:13.600]  because Joe Biden supported it.
[1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:19.600]  Joe Biden did what he did with gas, oil in the United States
[1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:24.600]  in terms of production to support Ukraine, to share the suffering.
[1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:28.600]  Everybody had to go into this global recession together
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:35.600]  because it's the only way they can get their eco-fascism online.
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:40.600]  The world of windmills starts with Ukraine, unfortunately.
[1:23:40.600 --> 1:23:48.600]  In terms of the war here, if they destroy Russia and Ukraine,
[1:23:48.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  they destroy one of the last hopes the world is going to see
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:59.600]  for regular democracy at this point until we get the Democrats out of office.
[1:23:59.600 --> 1:24:05.600]  Now, let's say going into the midterms in the United States,
[1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:14.600]  we have a big uptick in Tifa and BLM, violence, right afterwards, if the Republicans win.
[1:24:14.600 --> 1:24:20.600]  Well, what is this going to do going towards 2024?
[1:24:20.600 --> 1:24:27.600]  You've also had 2017 to 2020, yet a massive inflow of Ukrainian national
[1:24:27.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  since the United States has came right off the front lines.
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.600]  And they're not soldiers. These people are head cutters.
[1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:38.600]  That's what they do. They murder people.
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:41.600]  These are the people that are backing up Antifa right now.
[1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:48.600]  And they have been. Their violence on, you know, get the violence done on a phone call.
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.600]  Ukraine is exporting that right now.
[1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:55.600]  Political violence is the biggest export.
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:58.600]  At the same time, the capital riots were going on.
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  Aslov was running two coups in South America, in Chile and Ecuador.
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:08.600]  And Aslov had people at the Capitol Hill.
[1:25:08.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  Two to three break-ins were done by Aslov members.
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:14.600]  And that's on film.
[1:25:14.600 --> 1:25:16.600]  And so stop, stop that.
[1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:20.600]  I said, I want you to elaborate. For those that don't know, Aslov is doing school shootings.
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:22.600]  They're doing bombings in Russia.
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:25.600]  It's confirmed that they're doing assassination teams all over the world.
[1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  The globalists, the CIA are using them as a cutout country to dump hundreds of billions of dollars in.
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  It's not just 80 billion.
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:37.600]  And then basically use that as a cutout, just like the CIA ship guns through Mexico
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:40.600]  with fast inferiority before that with Iran and Contra.
[1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:44.600]  They're now basically using this as a cutout, a plausible vulnerability
[1:25:44.600 --> 1:25:48.600]  for political violence around the world.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:50.600]  That's exactly right.
[1:25:50.600 --> 1:25:54.600]  And as a matter of fact, Christopher Ray, as bad as he is,
[1:25:54.600 --> 1:26:00.600]  put a stop to these people going into the U.S. in 2020
[1:26:00.600 --> 1:26:08.600]  for the simple fact that the FBI at that point was attributing terrorist acts in the United States to Aslov.
[1:26:08.600 --> 1:26:13.600]  Now, one of the major ones that everyone would know about,
[1:26:13.600 --> 1:26:16.600]  that they don't know the attribution,
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:23.600]  do you remember the parlor hack where everybody that was on parlor was doxxed?
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:26.600]  Yes.
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:37.600]  The security system for parlor was actually made by an Aslov member who left the back door.
[1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:44.600]  So that whole situation was just to get to doxxed, mega and conservatives.
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:49.600]  So just like at the end of World War II, 35,000 Nazis were hired because they had plausible vulnerability
[1:26:49.600 --> 1:26:54.600]  and put in charge of the intelligence agencies, NASA, and so much more worldwide.
[1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:59.600]  They were saying the very same interest had basically used the stay-behind networks left by the Nazis
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:02.600]  that have been incubated and funded by George Soros for decades,
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:07.600]  now not just for Ukraine, but as a worldwide revolutionary launch point
[1:27:07.600 --> 1:27:13.600]  similar to Stalin and Lenin using Russia as a revolutionary launchpad.
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:15.600]  That's exactly right.
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:21.600]  And when you look at people like activists like Andrea Chalupa, Alexander Chalupa,
[1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:27.600]  these are the grandchildren of Nazi SS.
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:30.600]  And when they came here, the groups that you were talking about,
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:32.600]  they actually came in military formations.
[1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:35.600]  They divided down by occupation.
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:39.600]  So you have people that are men at arms.
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.600]  They went into the CIA, did that.
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:44.600]  They had intelligence people.
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:51.600]  They went either communications in the U.S. or in Eastern Europe. They started doing that.
[1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:54.600]  So what you're saying is, and I totally agree with you when you pull back,
[1:27:54.600 --> 1:27:59.600]  we'll come back and talk about this, is the war that ended in 1945 never really ended
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:04.600]  and that this is Hitler's revenge in a sick way.
[1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.600]  They're determined to win it now.
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:10.600]  That's exactly right.
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  People say when Putin says they're Nazis, they go, oh, that's propaganda.
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:18.600]  These are literally, they hail Hitler.
[1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:23.600]  We were showing their rallyers early. They actually do the fascist salute.
[1:28:23.600 --> 1:28:27.600]  Well, we don't even need to go that far.
[1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:32.600]  You had to have been there. They were their own type of Nazis.
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:38.600]  After World War II, they were taken out of Eastern Europe, Central Europe.
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:42.600]  They were there. And then we have the vice prime minister of Canada,
[1:28:42.600 --> 1:28:47.600]  whose dad was the number 200 gerbils for propaganda in Eastern Europe.
[1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:49.600]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:29:12.600]  It's all true. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:25.600]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:29:25.600 --> 1:29:28.600]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations,
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.600]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:36.600]  and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable.
[1:29:36.600 --> 1:29:42.600]  So please visit saveinfowars.com, saveinfowars.com,
[1:29:42.600 --> 1:29:46.600]  where you can make straight donations, five, 10, $50, $100, whatever you can,

[1:29:49.600 --> 1:29:51.600]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.

[1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:14.600]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[1:30:14.600 --> 1:30:18.600]  and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[1:30:18.600 --> 1:30:26.600]  as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:30:26.600 --> 1:30:30.600]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:36.600]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:40.600]  I don't take the credit. I give you the credit.

[1:33:01.600 --> 1:33:03.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:10.600 --> 1:33:13.600]  You founded the tip of the spear.
[1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:16.600]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:23.600]  So even New Yorker Magazine asks, are we already at war with Russia?
[1:33:23.600 --> 1:33:27.600]  There is yes and who are the real players?
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:32.600]  This goes back to World War II and the absorption of the Nazi system into the West.
[1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:33.600]  It's a historical fact.
[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:37.600]  I don't think it's a Nazi conspiracy, but if they'll stay behind networks, been preparing.
[1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:41.600]  They've been trying to lure Russia into this in the last Shibble War for eight years.
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.600]  And George Eliason is a long time investigative journalist, highly respected for decades.
[1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:46.600]  TNT Radio Live.
[1:33:46.600 --> 1:33:48.600]  He lives over there.
[1:33:48.600 --> 1:33:53.600]  Start over again and explain to people why this is so big and where you see this escalation going.
[1:33:56.600 --> 1:34:00.600]  Well, the actual prize in this is the United States.
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:13.600]  If they fully change over the fabric of America into a fascist socialist society and they're not that far off right now.
[1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  You look around underneath Joe Biden, how fast this is deteriorating.
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:20.600]  They win.
[1:34:20.600 --> 1:34:22.600]  Their goal is to get rid of conservatives.
[1:34:22.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  Take away your voice altogether.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:28.600]  Any voice of reason altogether.
[1:34:28.600 --> 1:34:34.600]  And the purpose of that is because those voices are the only ones that have ever stood up to them.
[1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:39.600]  Those voices are the only ones that ever actually fought with them.
[1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:42.600]  Progressives, they make them up.
[1:34:42.600 --> 1:34:44.600]  And here's the thing with Antifa.
[1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  If you go back into the history into the 1930s, Antifa in Germany became the brown shirts.
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:35:00.600]  And when they had the night at the Long Knives, all that was about was there was like Antifa today,
[1:35:00.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  you have groups of them that are drugged out drunk criminals.
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:06.600]  And they were bad for the party image.
[1:35:06.600 --> 1:35:09.600]  So they had the night at the Long Knives, they got rid of those.
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  What was left over became the SS.
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:20.600]  The SS, Waffen SS, was actually a part of Antifa.
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.600]  That's how it got its start.
[1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:27.600]  So these groups today, they're not looking for democracy.
[1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.600]  They're not looking for equality.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.600]  They're not looking for equity.
[1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:33.600]  They're looking to stomp on normal people.
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:41.600]  To do this, they have to destroy normal values, God, family, country, all of that has to go.
[1:35:41.600 --> 1:35:43.600]  The state has to be everything.
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:45.600]  The leaders have to be everything.
[1:35:45.600 --> 1:35:49.600]  You cannot argue with the leader in power and doing that.
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:51.600]  Let me just back you up for those that don't know.
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:57.600]  Antifa was founded in Germany supposedly to be anti-Nazi 45 years ago.
[1:35:57.600 --> 1:36:00.600]  Well, it was actually founded in World War I and World War II,
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:05.600]  but it's always had fascist connections and it's basically a leftist arm of the same things.
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:06.600]  What you're saying is very astute.
[1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  Most people don't even know that.
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:13.600]  Well, you know, you get to understand fascism for what it is.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.600]  It's actually a leftist value.
[1:36:15.600 --> 1:36:20.600]  Gianna Vanni Gentili, the author of Fascism, the guy that wrote the book with Mussolini,
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:23.600]  described it as the epitome of socialism.
[1:36:23.600 --> 1:36:25.600]  It is the final step of socialism.
[1:36:25.600 --> 1:36:26.600]  That's right.
[1:36:26.600 --> 1:36:32.600]  Mussolini was the deputy leader of the socialist until he became the fascista.
[1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:38.600]  Yeah, and fascism was the top end of socialism as far as they were concerned.
[1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  It had nothing to do with left or right.
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:43.600]  It was all left and left.
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  And because they were warring together, every one of them, you know, you equate,
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:50.600]  well, right wing is violent.
[1:36:50.600 --> 1:36:51.600]  Well, no, it's not.
[1:36:51.600 --> 1:36:53.600]  It's always been on the left.
[1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.600]  If you look at Middle America today, show me the violence.
[1:36:58.600 --> 1:37:01.600]  When they've been threatened in 2020, show me the violence.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:03.600]  Show me the retribution.
[1:37:03.600 --> 1:37:05.600]  It never happened.
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:07.600]  Look at the Capitol Hill.
[1:37:07.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  You had all those people there.
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:15.600]  You had people that were riled up by professional agitators.
[1:37:15.600 --> 1:37:16.600]  Okay.
[1:37:16.600 --> 1:37:22.600]  But they still had to have outsiders breaking in at two spots, the Capitol.
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:23.600]  People went in.
[1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:24.600]  Yeah.
[1:37:24.600 --> 1:37:26.600]  Walking around.
[1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:31.600]  But why were the people breaking the glass, screaming in Ukrainian?
[1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:34.600]  You know, whizzing investigation.
[1:37:34.600 --> 1:37:37.600]  They're on film, yelling in Ukrainian.
[1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.600]  Vistra, Vistra.
[1:37:39.600 --> 1:37:40.600]  Faster, faster.
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  And that's right.
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  And people were connected to Charlottesville.
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:48.600]  It's come out in court documents that were involved in the 2000 and what was it,
[1:37:48.600 --> 1:37:53.600]  16 and 14 operations in Ukraine.
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:55.600]  Well, that's exactly right.
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:57.600]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[1:37:57.600 --> 1:38:03.600]  They're moving these people to the United States to do these things.
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:09.600]  With that, you have the Democratic Party and the people behind the Democratic Party.
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:13.600]  Now, you have a giant voting block with the Ukrainian diaspora.
[1:38:13.600 --> 1:38:18.600]  You have the Ukrainian Congressional Committee of America as the main leader.
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  And they are literally the most powerful lobbying outfit in the United States today.
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:28.600]  They're bigger than Saudi Arabia in terms of lobby power.
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  Yeah.
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:34.600]  Right now they're getting roughly what about seven, eight times what Israel gets.
[1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:35.600]  Oh, yeah.
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  Think about this.
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:38.600]  And what is Ukraine?
[1:38:38.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  They can't.
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:42.600]  Ukraine was the richest country coming out of the Soviet Union.
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  They had everything.
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  All the research from the Soviet Union was done in Ukraine.
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:50.600]  Rockets were built there.
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:51.600]  Medical research.
[1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  All this going for them.
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:57.600]  And what they did with it was just squander it.
[1:38:57.600 --> 1:39:03.600]  They basically busted it out like a mafia kingpin does a restaurant.
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:06.600]  Everything down to the silverware.
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:11.600]  Now, the key to understanding Ukraine is this.
[1:39:11.600 --> 1:39:14.600]  The diaspora carried the Nazi vision.
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  The Nazi violence and vision never left these people.
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:23.600]  They didn't allow their kids to assimilate into American values.
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:28.600]  After World War II, they started a government in exile.
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  Ukrainian government in exile that ended up in Canada.
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:38.600]  And you see, Freeland's family was kingpins in it, more or less royalty.
[1:39:38.600 --> 1:39:42.600]  But they also had that government in exile.
[1:39:42.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  In 1991, 92, when Ukraine destroyed the Soviet Union by leaving it and became its own free country,
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:40:00.600]  it was a government in exile that gave them one, the power of state, two, the symbols of state, which were Nazi.
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  Ukraine, Kravchuk had signed a contract that Ukraine would be a Nazi state according to the Ukrainian diaspora government in exile.
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:19.600]  And when they didn't do that, you had the Orange Revolution that was supposed to be fixed.
[1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:26.600]  And when that didn't do that, the former government in exile told Ukraine,
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:32.600]  you need to clean this up and be a national state, a bandera state.
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  If you don't, we'll have our own revolution and you won't survive it.
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:41.600]  They did that in 2014.
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:49.600]  What you see in Ukraine now is what they always envisioned all these years as far as the government goes.
[1:40:49.600 --> 1:40:54.600]  No freedom of speech, you can't argue with the government, you can't question the government.
[1:40:54.600 --> 1:41:02.600]  The government has the right to come in, rob you, rape you, kill you, and you go to the police.
[1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:06.600]  In Ukraine right now, Azov is the police.
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  So if Azov robbed you, you go to the police, you go into Azov.
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:12.600]  That's who you're going to.
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:15.600]  You're complaining to Azov, Azov robbed you.
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  How far do you think that's going to go?
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:20.600]  And in what direction?
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:22.600]  That's what they want for America.
[1:41:22.600 --> 1:41:25.600]  They'll put their own people in place.
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:28.600]  Forget about the cops like Adam 12 used to be.
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  Remember that show?
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:35.600]  Think about cops like Antifa coming to your door.
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:38.600]  So BLM attacks your home or your business.
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:44.600]  You call the police and Antifa shows up and they beat you up for wasting their time.
[1:41:44.600 --> 1:41:48.600]  That's their ideal state in America.
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  And that's what's in Ukraine right now.
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:56.600]  That's what Ukrainians, and I'm not talking Donbass.
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:41:58.600]  I'm talking around Kiev.
[1:41:58.600 --> 1:42:00.600]  That's what people face.
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:04.600]  I first got here in 2009.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:09.600]  And Ukraine, I'll tell you, is very peaceful, very quiet.
[1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  The people were just wonderful.
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  Everybody got along.
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:15.600]  Then all this happened.
[1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  The info war kicked up.
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:19.600]  It was very purposeful.
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  It was from a company called SCL and Iota Global.
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:28.600]  They designed the information war that's going on right now.
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  And once in a while I talked to the guy managing it.
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:36.600]  He contacts me to the globe because I exposed him.
[1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  He designed the information policy for Ukraine.
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  So everything you see going on, it's actually designed to work in the United States
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:52.600]  and it's being run out of the State Department.
[1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:56.600]  I'm going to have you back for a full hour soon and we'll do a commercial free podcast.
[1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:01.600]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support,
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:06.600]  info wars continues to persevere against the attacks never before seen in the western world
[1:43:06.600 --> 1:43:08.600]  against independent media.
[1:43:08.600 --> 1:43:10.600]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:43:10.600 --> 1:43:12.600]  You have come to the table.
[1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:16.600]  You have stepped to the plate so many times and kept info wars and free speech on the air.
[1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:17.600]  And I thank you.
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:21.600]  But now I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:23.600]  And I need your support.
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:26.600]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:28.600]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist,

[1:43:41.600 --> 1:43:43.600]  four years in the making is almost over.
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:45.600]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.

[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:30.600]  This really is the missing link.
[1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:33.600]  X3 sold out for a long time is finally back in stock.
[1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:38.600]  Available at infowarstore.com or by calling toll free.

[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:52.600]  It's not just your immune system, but it's for your energy and so much more.
[1:46:52.600 --> 1:46:54.600]  X3 back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:54.600 --> 1:46:56.600]  50% off.
[1:46:56.600 --> 1:47:01.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:03.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:20.600]  So it's now 80 plus million dollars just since February that's been pumped in the last six, seven months.
[1:47:20.600 --> 1:47:28.600]  And so it's a lot bigger than just Ukraine. They admit the implosion of Ukraine's been used for a Marshall plan to create hundreds of trillions of dollars, quote, save Europe.
[1:47:28.600 --> 1:47:30.600]  That's why the pipelines are being blown up.
[1:47:30.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  It's rather being shut down here.
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:33.600]  We're being put into an artificial crisis.
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:42.600]  And then the fascism, the authoritarianism of the BLM, of the Antifa who's supporting the Azobotallians is meant as a model to be exported here.
[1:47:42.600 --> 1:47:46.600]  And a lot of the money that's sent there comes right back to fund these black projects.
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  George Eliasen is laying this out from T&E radio.com. He lives over there.
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  But just just in general, the pipeline, the war, Putin's police action.
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:47:58.600]  He now says it's expanding.
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:02.600]  I'm adding it's safe to say he is facing NATO and the full assault.
[1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  Just just just a gestalt.
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  What's the big picture?
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:11.600]  How bad is the escalation? Where do you see this going?
[1:48:11.600 --> 1:48:23.600]  Okay. If we look at the pipeline itself, I talked to Mike Ryan at T&E radio this morning about the who done it.
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:25.600]  It was actually Germany.
[1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:32.600]  I'll be doing a full report on it, hopefully finishing it by the end of the week.
[1:48:32.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  Germany went through a very quiet coup during their last election.
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:44.600]  And believe it or not, they're being run by a party that only got 15% of the vote.
[1:48:44.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  That's what's going on there.
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:56.600]  They're fully behind the Nazis in Ukraine because the Green Party, the Greens is actually a nationalist party.
[1:48:56.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  Nazis were thrown out of it in the last decade, as a matter of fact, because they were caught.
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:09.600]  They're eco-fascists, so they've been supporting what's going on in Ukraine the entire time.
[1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:23.600]  And they're actually helping to organize the media war through, if you look at NATO Stratkom, Germany helped set that up with SCL.
[1:49:23.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  The war itself, Putin came into this as an operation that was going to free Dumbos.
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:36.600]  And quite literally, he had half the troops that Ukraine fielded that were already there.
[1:49:36.600 --> 1:49:46.600]  If he didn't come in when he did, Ukraine, within a week, Ukraine was going to do what they call the Croatian scenario.
[1:49:46.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  Overrun everything, kill everybody, do it very, very fast, and they'll be able to get away with it.
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:54.600]  That's what was going to happen last February.
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  And that's what kicked all of this off.
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:50:03.600]  Now, running with half the troops that Ukraine has, look at the gains that Putin's made.
[1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  It's never been to take over Ukraine. That was never on the table.
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  But what they're finding on the ground is that all these different regions, obelisks in Ukraine, want to be free of Ukraine.
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  Because think about this. You're being run by people that worship the people that killed your grandparents.
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:32.600]  And they look at you the same way the people that killed your grandparents looked at your grandparents.
[1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  And by the way, major Ukrainian leaders have called Russians subhuman. It's all Nazi nomenclature.
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:40.600]  But they have big rallies. They're not hiding this.
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:45.600]  Well, they're not hiding this, but they keep it out of media pretty well in the West.
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  That's Joe Harding.
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  Now, with all of that, so you're looking at, it's actually 100 years ago this year was the last time everybody in Ukraine was called Russian.
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:03.600]  They were all Russian before that.
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:09.600]  And then all of a sudden by an act of the pen, Lenin made them Ukrainian.
[1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:14.600]  He did this to satisfy the generation before Bandera.
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:17.600]  Okay, that we're over in the Hungarian Empire.
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:28.600]  So the Nationalists today look at regular Ukrainians as garbage.
[1:51:28.600 --> 1:51:35.600]  They're just people that they need to sweep the streets, clean the sewers, whatever, and they don't need too many of them.
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:38.600]  Sure. They're the Uber mention, and that's all on record.
[1:51:38.600 --> 1:51:44.600]  And then they try to square it going, Oh, well, Zelensky's Jewish, but that maybe Zelensky said six months ago.
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:49.600]  He goes, Yeah, as off Nazis, that they are what they are, get over it.
[1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:53.600]  Well, be honest with you.
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:55.600]  Religion doesn't have anything to do with it.
[1:51:55.600 --> 1:51:58.600]  Power politics and religion are different things.
[1:51:58.600 --> 1:52:06.600]  So you can be Jewish and, you know, quite frankly, you can be a Democrat or a Republican, a Nazi, a fascist picture poison.
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.600]  You want to be, you want to be a communist, you can be Jewish and a communist.
[1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:09.600]  No, I agree with you.
[1:52:09.600 --> 1:52:12.600]  So I'm going to get you back for a commercial free podcast soon.
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  But just big picture.
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:16.600]  I see this only escalating getting worse.
[1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:21.600]  You think Russia is going to retaliate blowing up pipelines, Secretary of State all the minute they blow it up.
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:24.600]  I mean, how do you see this unfolding?
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:33.600]  I see this as Russia taking it very, very slowly and making sure with the investigation.
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:42.600]  The United States would want ultimately probable deniability, which means even though they okayed it, they didn't have hand in it.
[1:52:42.600 --> 1:52:47.600]  The people that I see doing it are the people that were there.
[1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:51.600]  They were doing operations, which is the Germans.
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:56.600]  They have skin in the game to get that done.
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:04.600]  Is that why Der Spiegel blamed the CIA? Because I noticed the first to say Germany was the first to say the U.S. did it.
[1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:10.600]  Yeah, well, Baerbauch wants to destroy the economy of Germany.
[1:53:10.600 --> 1:53:13.600]  They want people to stop buying cars.
[1:53:13.600 --> 1:53:17.600]  They want people to not be able to afford to eat meat.
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:20.600]  I mean, I mean, I mean, Koshwab said this is great.
[1:53:20.600 --> 1:53:23.600]  This is going to make people go on the Great Reset.
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:27.600]  Exactly. And that's exactly what it is, too.
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:31.600]  So Germany has the most skin in that game right now.
[1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:35.600]  They want to turn North Africa into a big solar panel.
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:40.600]  That's their concept of being, you know, eco-friendly energy.
[1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:44.600]  And they're going to turn Ukraine into a wind farm.
[1:53:44.600 --> 1:53:48.600]  So that'll be powering Germany, too.
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.600]  And this is all what's in the plans right now.
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:54:01.600]  So if they had that pipe there, if they had that option, at some point the German people would demand it because they can't afford to live like this.
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:04.600]  Once you start freezing, you're going to want a solution.
[1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:12.600]  And quite frankly, the German leadership under Baerbauch, who only got 15% of the vote.
[1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:15.600]  Now, keep that in mind.
[1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:24.600]  She lost the election, but as the foreign minister, because she's doing this with Ukraine, she's controlling the domestic policy.
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:30.600]  Her party has ultimate power in Germany right now, above every other figure.
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:33.600]  That's right. War is always the gateway for authoritarianism.
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:37.600]  So in closing, join us again for a full hour to really get into all this.
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:43.600]  Who's winning the war right now, Russia or the globalist?
[1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:47.600]  Russia is. Russia's got to get into it, the war.
[1:54:47.600 --> 1:54:50.600]  They still haven't yet, you know, in real terms.
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:56.600]  They were limited by the law what they could do because it was just, you know, a limited excursion.
[1:54:56.600 --> 1:55:00.600]  It's like the President of the United States says, I'm going to send troops over there to do this.
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:09.600]  Well, without an act of war, you can't bring in, you know, all the equipment, all the tech, you know, the soldiers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:13.600]  It's very limited. They're untying their hands right now.
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:17.600]  And that's part of what the referendum was about.
[1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:23.600]  It was to make sure, because they're not doing it for foreign countries now, they're doing it as self-protection part of Russia.
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:27.600]  And that's the big takeaway. Now those areas are Russia, and I guess you live in one of those.
[1:55:27.600 --> 1:55:29.600]  And so now the real war is about to start.
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:35.600]  Yes. It's kind of interesting. I didn't go to Russia, Russia came to me.
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:37.600]  You know, go figure.
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:42.600]  Well, do this for me. If you want to come on Saturday for our commercial free, those are big shows.
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:45.600]  I'd love you to send us a bunch of documents, articles, everything you say.
[1:55:45.600 --> 1:55:49.600]  I know my own mind is real. You've got next level understanding of it. You can teach us a lot.
[1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:54.600]  So I want to thank you for joining us, George Eliason TNT radio dot live.
[1:55:54.600 --> 1:55:58.600]  Thank you so much. I look forward to speaking to you soon.
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:00.600]  Thanks Alex for having me.
[1:56:00.600 --> 1:56:02.600]  Well, that guy knows what he's talking about.
[1:56:02.600 --> 1:56:06.600]  And it's very frustrating because this is bad news for everybody.
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:13.600]  All right, we're going to break. We have the father of the US biological chemical weapons law and he helped write to UN law.
[1:56:13.600 --> 1:56:18.600]  And he predicted everything unlike anybody else. He's about to tell you what's coming next.
[1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:22.600]  Dr. Francis Boyle joins us next hour.
[1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:24.600]  You're not going to get information like this anywhere else.
[1:56:24.600 --> 1:56:29.600]  We need your support. We're under globalist attack. You want somebody to fight for you? We're doing it.
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:39.600]  But I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get products you already need. If you don't get our 1100% daily allowance of vitamin C with rose hips and zinc, you're crazy.
[1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  The Linus Pauling formula of vitamin C.
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:47.600]  If you don't get X3, all three good types of iodine that just supercharge your whole body back in stock, 50% off.
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  I think you're crazy.
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:52.600]  We have the infowar store, Supercell, biggest sell of the year running right now.
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  It only runs for one more week or I guess eight, nine days or until next Sunday, not this Sunday, but the Sunday after.
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:01.600]  It's all available at infowarstore.com.
[1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:03.600]  I guess the week's already flying by. No, it ends this Sunday.
[1:57:03.600 --> 1:57:05.600]  Wow, time just feels crazy.
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:07.600]  So like six, seven days left of the sale.
[1:57:07.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:10.600]  Survival Shield X3.
[1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:11.600]  Ultimate Creole Oil.
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:12.600]  Out of power.
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:13.600]  DNA Force Plus.
[1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:14.600]  Brain Force Plus.
[1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:16.600]  Brain Force Ultra.
[1:57:16.600 --> 1:57:23.600]  It's all available at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:57:23.600 --> 1:57:32.600]  And we will come back with Dr. Francis Boyle and we've got so much to cover because they're getting ready with the next leg of their next bioweapon attack.
[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:35.600]  Only exposing these monsters can stop them.
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  This is a worldwide concerted destabilization effort.
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  Only the truth will stop them.
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:54.600]  1776coin.com.
[1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:16.600]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:25.600]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I've been forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[1:58:25.600 --> 1:58:26.600]  It's unsustainable.
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:31.600]  So please visit saveinfowarstore.com.
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:39.600]  Saveinfowarstore.com where you can make straight donations, five, 10, $50, $100, whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[1:58:39.600 --> 1:58:40.600]  I'll never give up.
[1:58:40.600 --> 1:58:42.600]  I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[1:58:42.600 --> 1:58:43.600]  Thank you for your support.
[1:58:43.600 --> 1:58:44.600]  Wouldn't be without you.
[1:58:44.600 --> 1:58:47.600]  Saveinfowarstore.com.
[1:58:47.600 --> 1:58:52.600]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[1:58:52.600 --> 1:58:58.600]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:05.600]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[1:59:05.600 --> 1:59:12.600]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them forward are the real reason you've had the success.
[1:59:12.600 --> 1:59:18.600]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[1:59:18.600 --> 1:59:31.600]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon, and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[1:59:31.600 --> 1:59:41.600]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now, because we are over the target and this great is happening.
[1:59:41.600 --> 2:00:05.600]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight, God bless you all.
[2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:12.600]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to SCUM!
[2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:23.600]  We're beholden to SCUM, and the Russian is SCUM!
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:42.600]  Please listen, if you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike in you!
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:53.600]  We're coming, we're coming, help, help, they're coming, they're coming, listen to me, listen, help me!
[2:00:53.600 --> 2:00:59.600]  Your next, please, your next, they're in danger, please listen to me, it's something terrible.
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:06.600]  Your next, here they are, they're already here, help, your next, they're coming, they're coming!
[2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:13.600]  The seed is planted, terror grows.
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  Elizabeth, wake up, get you when you sleep, sit up.
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:20.600]  Invasion of the body snatches.
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:25.600]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites, is it contagious?
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:27.600]  It's real homies.
[2:01:27.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  It looked right at me.
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:29.600]  You need to get up.
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:31.600]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human.
[2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:36.600]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[2:01:36.600 --> 2:01:38.600]  We're being cornered.
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:41.600]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[2:01:41.600 --> 2:01:43.600]  The barricading street.
[2:01:43.600 --> 2:01:47.600]  The invasion of the body-sangers.
[2:01:47.600 --> 2:02:08.600]  The land of the walking dead.
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:13.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[2:02:13.600 --> 2:02:20.600]  It's Alice Jones.
[2:02:20.600 --> 2:02:28.600]  Now, there is something though that I do want to talk about in terms of what's going on here in this state right now.
[2:02:28.600 --> 2:02:30.600]  I don't know if you know about this.
[2:02:30.600 --> 2:02:40.600]  This is a dark alliance that's been built together between Josh Shapiro and politicians like him.
[2:02:40.600 --> 2:02:45.600]  And Dr. Rachel Levine.
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:46.600]  Yes.
[2:02:46.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  I know.
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:49.600]  I know.
[2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  They have now instituted a new program.
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:53.600]  We have them on video.
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:55.600]  We have them on video saying this.
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:05.600]  That they will take under 18-year-olds, which means minors, if you've been emancipated, if you're on the street,
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:10.600]  or even if you're in the foster system.
[2:03:10.600 --> 2:03:20.600]  And they will take children from the foster system and put them into this gender transition therapy.
[2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.600]  We know what the pronouns are for.
[2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:25.600]  We know what the grooming behavior is for.
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:26.600]  And what do they call it?
[2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:28.600]  What does Dr. Levine call it?
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:30.600]  Transgeneration.
[2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  That was the name.
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:36.600]  That was the name they put this thing.
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:37.600]  Dr. Levine said that.
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:38.600]  Not me.
[2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:39.600]  Transgeneration.
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:41.600]  They'll do this to foster children.
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:45.600]  Kids who are already at a vulnerable point, right?
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:49.600]  They're obviously already suffered so much trauma, and we've heard the issues in the foster system.
[2:03:49.600 --> 2:03:50.600]  It's a cult.
[2:03:50.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  Now imagine you've got a kid like that who knows what happened to the parents,
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  and you start throwing this stuff at them.
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:03:59.600]  And Dr. Levine said, I'm happy to do it.
[2:03:59.600 --> 2:04:01.600]  Of course you're happy to do it.
[2:04:01.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  Why?
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  Because it's all about money.
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:08.600]  And Vanderbilt University, we have them on tape too.
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:09.600]  They said it's a cash cow.
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:10.600]  Why?
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  Because the younger they get you, the more money they can get you over the course of your life.
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:21.600]  And if the insurance doesn't cover it, then you're paying out of pocket $40,000 up front,
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:27.600]  and then further treatments and further procedures for the rest of your life.
[2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:29.600]  They don't care about you as people.
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:32.600]  They're going for your children.
[2:04:32.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  And what's Dr. Levine doing?
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:40.600]  Rachel Levine is trying to make it so that insurance will cover this.
[2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:43.600]  That every insurer will cover this.
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:44.600]  And guess what?
[2:04:44.600 --> 2:04:47.600]  All the insurance companies, they're all for this too.
[2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:48.600]  Why?
[2:04:48.600 --> 2:04:49.600]  Again, cash cow.
[2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:53.600]  They're coming after everybody.
[2:04:53.600 --> 2:04:58.600]  Don't just boil straight ahead and stay with us.
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:28.600]  Towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:35.600]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:38.600]  have taken action and supported this show.
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:40.600]  I don't take the credit.
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  I give you the credit.
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:45.600]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:46.600]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:05:46.600 --> 2:05:48.600]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[2:06:21.600 --> 2:06:32.600]  Well, there's no doubt we're doing the most important work in the world right now.
[2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:39.600]  And in the 55 minutes I have here, I can spend the entire time just praising Dr. Francis Boyle,
[2:06:39.600 --> 2:06:42.600]  who was the author of the U.S. Chemical Biological Weapons Law,
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:44.600]  one of the main contributors to the world law,
[2:06:44.600 --> 2:06:48.600]  former head prosecutor at the United Nations,
[2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  as well as Milosevic, so he's a heavy hitter.
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:56.600]  He's one of the few recipients, only one a year, of a special secret PhD at Harvard
[2:06:56.600 --> 2:06:59.600]  that Henry Kissinger, as a big presence, he went through.
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:02.600]  So people ask, why don't we have more insiders that go public?
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:06.600]  Well, he's been going public for 30-plus years.
[2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:09.600]  And he's a professor of law as well.
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:13.600]  He came on in January and February of 2020.
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:15.600]  He predicted everything to a T that happened.
[2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:20.600]  It is, quite frankly, nightmarish to go back and watch those interviews, which we've done,
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:24.600]  where he was so dead on with his research and background, how they made it into lab,
[2:07:24.600 --> 2:07:27.600]  how they released it, how the shot would make you sick and kill you.
[2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:33.600]  And then now, in the new executive order of Biden, they're planning the new attack.
[2:07:33.600 --> 2:07:37.600]  So you want tomorrow's news today, this is it.
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.600]  Meanwhile, AstraZeneca comes out and says, you know what?
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:43.600]  Our shot does cause blood clots.
[2:07:43.600 --> 2:07:45.600]  Big deal. Yeah, we're killing you.
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:48.600]  And foreign governments are banning all three of the shots.
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:54.600]  So there's a lot of good news as people wake up, but they're planning to hit us again.
[2:07:54.600 --> 2:08:00.600]  So Dr. Boyle, ahead of this interview, sent me some of the points he wants to get to.
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:08.600]  And he also sent us some articles, the executive order, executive order on advancing biotechnology
[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:16.600]  and bio-factoring innovation of the sustainable, safe, and secure American bioeconomy.
[2:08:16.600 --> 2:08:17.600]  It's a new economy.
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:20.600]  It's a food, we're told, is going to be all synthetic as well.
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  Another headline he sent to me is Dr. Mercola.
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:29.600]  Additional engineering pandemics, why additional engineering pandemics are to be expected.
[2:08:29.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  We've got all that.
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:34.600]  So here are the points that Dr. Boyle wants to get into.
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  I appreciate him joining us today.
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:41.600]  Biden executive order, point by point, and the implications of it.
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:44.600]  White House admits more pandemics will be created.
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:51.600]  And then these points, the toughest problems, and the Tamil genocide in Sri Lanka.
[2:08:51.600 --> 2:08:58.600]  He holds a doctorate of Madakum Latte, as well as PhD in political science from both Harvard University.
[2:08:58.600 --> 2:09:06.600]  His latest book is Poems Against the Empire, which is a collection of poetic reflections on his experiences fighting for peace, justice, human rights, international law, social welfare,
[2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:08.600]  and the United States Constitution.
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:11.600]  Dr. Boyle, you're going to give us next year's news today.
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:13.600]  This is so important.
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:16.600]  Thank you for joining us and go ahead and start wherever you like.
[2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:21.600]  Alex, thank you for having me on and my best to your viewing audience.
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  And before I get into the substance, let me just repeat for your audience so that they can evaluate what I am saying.
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:47.600]  I called for and drafted the United States Domestic Implementing Legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention that is known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989,
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  that was passed unanimously by both Houses of the United States Congress and signed into law by President George Bush Sr. with the approval of the United States Department of Justice.
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:12.600]  Now, that being said, then, there are two critical issues I want to discuss with your audience today.
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:21.600]  The first is the brand new executive order coming right out of Biden and his White House.
[2:10:21.600 --> 2:10:41.600]  And the second is the Interrelated World Health Organization Treaty that will set up a medical police state for the entire world and do an end run around American sovereignty.
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:45.600]  So let me take these one at a time.
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:49.600]  First, the Biden executive order.
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:11:01.600]  I won't go through all of it here because a lot of it is just total propaganda, Davos speak, and things of this nature.
[2:11:01.600 --> 2:11:20.600]  The critical part comes right at the very end where it says, quote, the objective Roman numeral seven, develop and work to promote and implement dual use research of concern.
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  Let me stop there.
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:32.600]  Develop work and promote dual use research of concern. What is dual use research of concern?
[2:11:32.600 --> 2:11:42.600]  They develop an offensive biological warfare weapon, and then they develop an alleged vaccine for it.
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:49.600]  That's dual use, offensive and defensive at the same in sequence.
[2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  So this is the official relaunching of the secret bio weapon program of this is officially launching a bio weapon program.
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  That's correct. And by President Biden himself. Yes, there's no doubt it's right there in writing and on the White House letterhead and Joe Biden himself personally proclaims this.
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:14.600]  That is what we are facing.
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:34.600]  So let me continue develop and work to promote and implement dual use research of concern that's offensive biological warfare weapons perfected by a so called vaccine.
[2:12:34.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  Let me continue and research involving potentially pandemic and other high consequence pathogens.
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:13:04.600]  So they admit that they will be engaging in the development of offensive biological warfare weapons involving potentially pandemic pathogens like covert 19 was which only violates the federal law you wrote.
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:17.600]  That's correct. And also the biological weapons convention of 1972. And they admit it right there. You can just read it Alex you just showed it to your audience.
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:21.600]  And then let me continue.
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:37.600]  And bio manufacturing related R&D globally research and develop globally. So they're going to do this all over the world. Indeed they already are in the BSL threes and BSL fours.
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:55.600]  They have established around the world. And now we know they're doing gain of function work even in BSL twos. All these BSL threes and BSL fours have to be shut down. And this dual use research Dirk has to be stopped immediately.
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:14:09.600]  If we don't want to see another pandemic. If you're listening to the news media and even the Biden administration. W. H. O. They're all saying well the other and another pandemic is coming.
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:21.600]  Right. It is coming precisely because of what we're reading here. This dual use research of concern involving potentially pandemic pathogens.
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:35.600]  And they admit it right there. So yes they're they're already planning the next pandemic for us along the lines of COVID-19 and bio manufacturing related R&D globally.
[2:14:35.600 --> 2:14:47.600]  So all around the world that that's what they're proposing. And you have us BSL threes BSL fours and some of our allies all over the world.
[2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:58.600]  So why are they arrogantly doing this to to try to legalize what they were already doing secretly that you expose as many others expose the big controversy in 2015 with Obama and Chapel Hill.
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:07.600]  And because that's what it looks to me as a layperson is they know all this criminal gain of functions coming out. So now he's trying to retroactively legalize it.
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:20.600]  Alex they've they've crossed the Rubicon and they know it. They can't go back. So they're just charging ahead full speed ahead. That's all I can figure here why they would admit this right there in plain English.
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:28.600]  But there there it is. I mean if you have a high school degree you can read that paragraph and figure out what's going on right.
[2:15:28.600 --> 2:15:46.600]  I mean it's pretty clear. But now let's let's also get into a bio manufacturing related R&D globally globally. All right. This then gets us into the draft World Health Organization Treaty.
[2:15:46.600 --> 2:15:53.600]  And stay there sir. For some reason I don't have that tree in front of me. I've seen it. We'll pull up in the break and come back with that which gets rid of our sovereignty.
[2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:57.600]  We'll be right back with Dr. Boyle.
[2:15:57.600 --> 2:16:07.600]  The will of God and by God working through you and your support info wars continues to persevere against the tax never before seen in the Western world.

[2:19:57.600 --> 2:20:13.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:33.600]  Mad scientist government in Biden in just the last few months, the White House and in Europe at a big EU meeting said new pandemics are coming while they are producing biological weapons illegally, not just in the US, but places like China, Ukraine, other places.
[2:20:33.600 --> 2:20:43.600]  And then they get to pose the saviors when the event happens and now the UN has a new major move to take over our sovereignty and the UN just brag to play the clip last night.
[2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:57.600]  But they're in control of censorship in America. The shutdown disinformation has turned out to be totally true. Here's a few clips of Biden this year we do need more money, but we don't just need more money for vaccines for children eventually.
[2:20:57.600 --> 2:21:08.600]  We need more money to plan for the second pandemic. There's going to be another pandemic. We have to think ahead. And that's not something the last outfit did very well. That's something we've been doing for fairly well.
[2:21:08.600 --> 2:21:10.600]  That's why we need the money. Thank you.
[2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:30.600]  Two years ago, COVID-19 didn't need any reminders about how critical investments healthcare systems were and health and health security is both to fight the pandemic and to prepare for the next one because it will not be the last pandemic we under we have to deal with.
[2:21:30.600 --> 2:21:40.600]  That's why the United States together with G7 partners in the World Bank are investing in a new industrial scale vaccine manufacturing facility in Senegal.
[2:21:40.600 --> 2:21:49.600]  When complete, we'll have the potential produce hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine annually for COVID-19 and other diseases.
[2:21:49.600 --> 2:21:59.600]  It's an investment that will enhance global vaccine supplies as well as improve access and equity for developing countries.
[2:21:59.600 --> 2:22:08.600]  So they produce the bio weapon. We say now confirm a count of a lab. They release it. They give us deadly shots and poses the saviors while getting stinking rich.
[2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:19.600]  Newly published analysis supports WHO pandemic treaty. Here's an analysis of the embryonic phase of the treaty. Our guest was involved in wrote the US laws and help write the UN laws on as well.
[2:22:19.600 --> 2:22:21.600]  Dr. Boyle, please continue.
[2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:38.600]  Right. So, well, okay. So, yes, Biden knows there's going to be another pandemic because his own laboratories here are preparing the virus that is going to produce the next pandemic whenever they decide to release it upon us.
[2:22:38.600 --> 2:22:53.600]  Indeed, monkeypox, in my opinion, obviously with 30 mutations beyond the wild type in Africa that came out of a biological warfare weapons program and laboratory.
[2:22:53.600 --> 2:23:08.600]  And the timing to me seems to indicate it was designed to scare monger people into accepting World Health Assembly regulations that failed.
[2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:23.600]  But those regulations I have now been carried forward into this new draft World Health Organization Treaty, which I just got a hold of this morning and had a chance to analyze.
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:49.600]  I won't go through all of it here. It's 19 pages long, Alex, but it's clear that this treaty if passed will give the World Health Organization dictatorial powers to determine health policies here in the United States in the event of another pandemic,
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:55.600]  which of course they know all along, they're going to create.
[2:23:55.600 --> 2:24:05.600]  And that gets into the language of the Biden executive order, quote, and bio manufacturing related R&D globally.
[2:24:05.600 --> 2:24:24.600]  So they're already planning, you know, for this to be global. And if you read the WHO treaty, first it uses the same type of Davos speak that we see in the Biden executive order, Klaus Schwab, the great reset, and the rest of them.
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:44.600]  And indeed, some of the concepts are exactly the same. Continuing the dual use research of concern, continuing with gain of function research that gave it gave us COVID-19 at the Wuhan BSL4, which is China's fourth detrick.
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:25:13.600]  So why, you know, why would any rational person want to give dictatorial powers to the WHO to deal with pandemics when we know, as a matter of fact, the WHO was involved in the Wuhan BSL4 where COVID-19 was created, along with the University of North Carolina BSL3.
[2:25:13.600 --> 2:25:40.600]  So the World Health Organization knew all about the COVID-19 pandemic. And as you know, they lied about it, they covered it up, they facilitated, and you can read through then the WHO treaty and see the overlap with some of the ideas and recommendations in the Biden executive order.
[2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:49.600]  So it does appear that the Bidenites have helped develop this WHO treaty.
[2:25:49.600 --> 2:26:11.600]  Sure, and obviously the World Economic Forum of the globalists, Bill Gates, have got their hands in it. So how would you quantify the end game? Just a total biomedical power grab, global vaccine IDs for global IDs for buying and selling, universal basic incomes, carbon taxes, I mean, they're announcing it all.
[2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:34.600]  Right. Most of it is in the treaty. Right. It's right in there by plain English, what they are going to do. And why would you want to give dictatorial powers to rule the world in the event of another pandemic that they are going to create into the hands of the WHO?
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:53.600]  When we know the WHO is controlled by the CDC, as you correctly pointed out, Bill Gates, Big Pharma, that will be developing these existentially dangerous vaccines that I call frankenshots, and also the communist government in China.
[2:26:53.600 --> 2:27:10.600]  Why would we give them dictatorial powers? And then the treaty will be set up, Alex, to do a total end run around the sovereignty of the United States of America when it comes to public health care.
[2:27:10.600 --> 2:27:34.600]  Under the 10th Amendment of the United States Constitution, you know, it says quite clearly, the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people, we the people.
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:46.600]  Now, that is what's known, we lawyers call the police powers of the state and local governments, and that is traditionally included public health.
[2:27:46.600 --> 2:28:06.600]  Now, if we get this treaty, what is going to happen then is that these WHO dictates on pandemics across the board will be able to overrule state and local governments that have dissented, have regained.
[2:28:06.600 --> 2:28:20.600]  You've seen, I'll play the clip next segment, the UN and others admit they're directing public health policy, they create the policy, and so already under Biden, they follow the order, so they're already in function following it.
[2:28:20.600 --> 2:28:39.600]  Right, and the CDC is pretty much using the WHO as a front organization to get around the problem that so many state and local authorities and the American people have rebelled against the CDC.
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:51.600]  We see who causes as to how the pandemic should be handled. Notice Texas is an open rebellion Miami, sorry, Florida is open and that's good news. Dr. Boyle stay right there.
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:29:11.600]  We'll come back with the UN head of information bragging about their power grab. Think about a world without info wars. Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:27.600]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the new World Order.

[2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:19.900]  1776 live from Austin, Texas
[2:33:20.540 --> 2:33:22.300]  Broadcasting worldwide
[2:33:22.300 --> 2:33:24.300]  It's Alex Jones
[2:33:24.300 --> 2:33:28.180]  A lot of big developments of the midterms the 36 days we're going to be covering
[2:33:28.700 --> 2:33:33.180]  The weaponization the judiciary and more Robert Barnes in studio with me fourth hour
[2:33:33.860 --> 2:33:40.660]  Dr. Francis Boyle author of the US biological chemical weapons law former head UN war crimes prosecutor
[2:33:41.580 --> 2:33:47.100]  He's here with us now laying out this incredible big pharma takeover of our society
[2:33:47.100 --> 2:33:51.300]  If you think they're just giving up on COVID and yes, people are fighting back and speaking out and yes
[2:33:51.300 --> 2:33:54.380]  They're having problems if you think they're going away
[2:33:54.380 --> 2:33:56.380]  You've been smoking something in tobacco
[2:33:57.060 --> 2:34:00.980]  But here is the spokesperson for the head of UN information
[2:34:02.180 --> 2:34:03.860]  Melissa Fleming
[2:34:03.860 --> 2:34:06.060]  Bragging how they own the science on
[2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:12.300]  Vaccines on climate change own science and now they're working with Google to censor people
[2:34:12.420 --> 2:34:17.340]  So that's what we're talking about is the UN running our medical system in America. Here it is
[2:34:17.340 --> 2:34:21.660]  You know, we partnered with Google. For example, if you Google climate change
[2:34:22.380 --> 2:34:27.860]  You will at the top of your search. You will get all kinds of UN resources
[2:34:28.500 --> 2:34:33.900]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we googled climate change
[2:34:34.060 --> 2:34:36.620]  We were getting incredibly distorted
[2:34:37.260 --> 2:34:41.300]  Information right at the top. So we we're becoming much more proactive
[2:34:41.300 --> 2:34:49.020]  You know, we own the science and we think that the world, you know, should know it and and the platforms themselves also do
[2:34:49.740 --> 2:34:58.420]  But again, it's it's it is it's it's a huge huge challenge that I think all sectors of society need to
[2:34:58.860 --> 2:35:02.060]  Be very active in so the UN owns
[2:35:02.580 --> 2:35:06.220]  questioning and they run Google and that's a good thing
[2:35:06.220 --> 2:35:13.340]  Imagine them as our doctor. So Dr. Boyle, please continue. Right and if you read the treaty
[2:35:13.340 --> 2:35:18.140]  That's obviously what's going to happen. People like me will be completely
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:28.540]  censored and cut off as disinformation and conspiracy theory and whatever new to Alex under the terms of this
[2:35:28.540 --> 2:35:35.220]  New treaty, it's all right in there just right through it. So what happened was they
[2:35:35.860 --> 2:35:38.420]  realized the amount and extent of
[2:35:39.780 --> 2:35:40.820]  resistance
[2:35:40.820 --> 2:35:45.380]  coming certainly from the American people and some of our
[2:35:46.100 --> 2:35:52.660]  elected officials and so they decided to do an in-run around this get this
[2:35:52.660 --> 2:35:58.500]  WHO treaty and if it's passed what will happen then is that the
[2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:06.180]  WHO will come up with some order that they concocted with the CDC and Bill Gates and the Chinese
[2:36:06.220 --> 2:36:13.140]  Communist government and bill a big pharma and tell our state and local authorities
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:20.500]  elected officials health authorities what they must do if they do not do it then the
[2:36:20.500 --> 2:36:22.980]  federal government will go into
[2:36:23.700 --> 2:36:25.140]  federal court
[2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:32.700]  Before a federal judge and they're part of the system too, you know, they they they get their paychecks for the US federal government and
[2:36:33.460 --> 2:36:35.460]  Seek an injunction
[2:36:35.740 --> 2:36:37.740]  against our own
[2:36:37.780 --> 2:36:46.100]  democratically elected officials and health care officials to comply with the latest orders coming out of the
[2:36:46.100 --> 2:36:50.140]  WHO CDC on pain of
[2:36:50.660 --> 2:36:52.660]  Being fined
[2:36:53.020 --> 2:37:01.300]  Exorbitantly no ten twenty thousand dollars a day. So a UN a UN medical dictatorship that also censors as well
[2:37:02.860 --> 2:37:08.020]  That's correct. If you read through the treaty, it's all very clear what's going to happen
[2:37:08.020 --> 2:37:10.660]  it will be under the control of the
[2:37:10.660 --> 2:37:16.020]  WHO that is basically a front organization for the CDC
[2:37:16.660 --> 2:37:22.980]  Bill Gates big pharma and the Communist Chinese government, right? We've discussed this before
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:27.220]  How do we fight this what do we do
[2:37:28.740 --> 2:37:38.580]  Well, I think on we have to defeat this treaty there's no question about it up and my advice is that we need a
[2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:40.380]  a
[2:37:40.380 --> 2:37:43.860]  circular letter by members of the
[2:37:44.460 --> 2:37:50.460]  Senate saying that if and when this treaty is presented to the Senate
[2:37:50.500 --> 2:37:52.500]  we will vote against it and
[2:37:52.700 --> 2:37:57.220]  We need to get one third plus one members of the US Senate
[2:37:57.820 --> 2:37:59.820]  signed on to that letter
[2:38:00.340 --> 2:38:03.580]  Send it to the head of the WHO Tedros
[2:38:04.140 --> 2:38:07.980]  Send it to every ambassador to the World Health Assembly
[2:38:07.980 --> 2:38:15.380]  And also send it to the foreign ministers of every government in the world if we make it clear that that treaty
[2:38:15.660 --> 2:38:17.660]  Will be defeated
[2:38:18.300 --> 2:38:23.100]  If if it is signed by the Biden administration, which I suspect it will be
[2:38:24.500 --> 2:38:30.300]  People might think twice why why are we going to sign on to this treaty when the Americans have made it clear?
[2:38:30.460 --> 2:38:33.020]  They will not what what's the game here?
[2:38:33.020 --> 2:38:38.420]  So that would be I think the way we need to proceed on this WHO
[2:38:39.100 --> 2:38:43.700]  Treaty to make it clear it will never never pass the United States Senate
[2:38:43.700 --> 2:38:50.740]  And we also then need to be lobbying every member of the United States Senate right now in advance
[2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:55.780]  Against this WHO treaty. Otherwise, we will be living under a
[2:38:55.780 --> 2:39:06.340]  a WHO global police state. Sure. Let's just back up because you don't want to cover ancient history
[2:39:06.340 --> 2:39:09.860]  But it's important to not to do a victory lap to prove how right you were go back
[2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:15.380]  Almost no, no, I mean, we're talking more than two and a half years ago. You laid out what they were going to do
[2:39:15.380 --> 2:39:17.620]  What was going to happen? What was going to come next?
[2:39:18.900 --> 2:39:22.220]  Can we look at how it's turned out these shots don't work? They make you sick
[2:39:22.220 --> 2:39:26.820]  How's it going for the globalist criminal investigations in the EU of the head of Pfizer?
[2:39:26.820 --> 2:39:29.420]  I mean, it looks like things aren't going well for them
[2:39:29.420 --> 2:39:32.180]  But as you said, they're just committed and charging forward
[2:39:32.500 --> 2:39:36.940]  They're not giving up and they're trying to start war in Russia. They've already started a war in Russia
[2:39:37.180 --> 2:39:42.780]  They're blowing up pipelines. I mean, this just seems like gooder-damer wrong apocalyptic stuff
[2:39:44.220 --> 2:39:47.620]  Well, you're right the I already had a
[2:39:47.620 --> 2:39:56.140]  45-minute conversation with the attorney general of Louisiana on my proposal of
[2:39:57.060 --> 2:39:58.500]  indicting
[2:39:58.500 --> 2:40:01.660]  Fauci Collins and and the rest of them
[2:40:02.700 --> 2:40:06.740]  For their involvement and everyone at the UNC BSL 3
[2:40:07.340 --> 2:40:09.340]  for their involvement in
[2:40:09.700 --> 2:40:11.700]  development of COVID-19
[2:40:11.700 --> 2:40:18.180]  Inditing them for murder and conspiracy to commit murder and then I also talked with him on a
[2:40:18.700 --> 2:40:20.700]  separate set of indictments for
[2:40:21.460 --> 2:40:23.460]  the chief
[2:40:24.620 --> 2:40:29.540]  Operating officers presidents chief scientific officers of the
[2:40:30.700 --> 2:40:37.020]  Executives in charge of the Franken shots. I wouldn't dignify them with the word vaccines at
[2:40:38.140 --> 2:40:39.900]  BioNTech
[2:40:39.900 --> 2:40:41.900]  Moderna, Pfizer
[2:40:42.580 --> 2:40:44.060]  AstraZeneca
[2:40:44.060 --> 2:40:49.940]  Etc right on murder and conspiracy to commit murder and I went through the
[2:40:51.420 --> 2:40:52.580]  Louisiana
[2:40:52.580 --> 2:40:59.420]  Statute I was originally hired here to teach criminal law taught for seven or eight years before I moved over to
[2:41:00.420 --> 2:41:06.140]  International human rights law and answered all his questions and at at the end of a 45-minute conversation
[2:41:06.140 --> 2:41:09.360]  He agreed with me on my theory of the case
[2:41:09.860 --> 2:41:15.380]  It was basically a political decision whether to indict these people
[2:41:15.380 --> 2:41:17.380]  I also had a similar
[2:41:17.940 --> 2:41:19.740]  35-minute
[2:41:19.740 --> 2:41:24.460]  Conversation with the deputy attorney general of South Carolina going through his
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:29.940]  Homestide statutes line by line with respect to these two sets of indictment
[2:41:29.940 --> 2:41:38.300]  For murder and conspiracy to commit murder and at the end of the 35 minutes he he agreed with me on the theory of the case
[2:41:38.500 --> 2:41:42.340]  But that is you know, it's it's a political decision to start
[2:41:43.500 --> 2:41:46.620]  Inditing these people. I think if we can get one
[2:41:47.660 --> 2:41:49.660]  courageous state or local
[2:41:50.220 --> 2:41:51.980]  County prosecutor
[2:41:51.980 --> 2:41:58.500]  To indict these people for murder and conspiracy to commit murder the whole house of cards will will collapse
[2:41:58.500 --> 2:42:05.860]  We did Jim garrison, but unlike the JFK thing. He was publicly successful in exposing it as an assassination
[2:42:06.860 --> 2:42:09.380]  Of the deep state but but not at bringing him to justice
[2:42:09.380 --> 2:42:15.900]  But but I agree with you the dominoes will start to fall because it's so obvious a lot about gain a function now Fauci and Dazik
[2:42:15.940 --> 2:42:22.300]  They've gotten a new contract for more corona bat research in China. I mean, they're really rubbing our nose in it
[2:42:22.300 --> 2:42:29.020]  Right as I said, they know they've crossed the Rubicon and there's no turning back. They know
[2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:37.580]  Certainly they violated my biological weapons anti-terrorism act and face life in in prison for sure
[2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:42.500]  And I'm sure it's gotten back to them that well, it's been all over that I'm
[2:42:43.780 --> 2:42:48.620]  Pursuing my campaign to get these people indicted for murder and conspiracy to commit murder
[2:42:48.620 --> 2:42:54.460]  And conspiracy to commit murder dr. Ball stay there. Let's talk about your campaign to get these criminals and died as straight ahead
[2:42:56.340 --> 2:42:58.180]  Look around you
[2:42:58.180 --> 2:43:02.660]  Everything I predicted from the globalist own documents from their own admissions is now happening

[2:45:57.420 --> 2:46:01.940]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist
[2:46:01.940 --> 2:46:04.100]  I have come from nowhere
[2:46:04.860 --> 2:46:08.340]  The very heights of politics not just in America to the world
[2:46:08.860 --> 2:46:15.340]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit
[2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:22.180]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you've had this success
[2:46:22.860 --> 2:46:27.060]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order
[2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:32.500]  You've ever had we are now entering the final mile of the marathon
[2:46:32.500 --> 2:46:35.700]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[2:46:35.900 --> 2:46:41.740]  Realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the effort you've been tearing out and to intensify them
[2:46:41.740 --> 2:46:48.180]  I bless you all I salute you. I thank you and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:46:48.300 --> 2:46:55.100]  Because we are over the target and this is happening. The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all
[2:46:55.100 --> 2:47:09.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones
[2:47:09.460 --> 2:47:26.340]  In early 2020, Dr. Francis Boyle came on this broadcast and others coming to you live from the info wars comm studios in the
[2:47:26.340 --> 2:47:39.740]  recaptured state of Texas Dr. Boyle in the eight nine minutes we have left here before dr. Has to leave us and before
[2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:44.300]  Robert Barnes joins us in studio
[2:47:45.060 --> 2:47:48.020]  You're on a quest to expose these people so they can't do it again
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:54.420]  Not just about vindictiveness. It's about stopping them and you were able over two and a half years ago to predict exactly
[2:47:54.420 --> 2:47:58.900]  What would happen? What's gonna happen if we don't bring them to justice? We have Rand Paul exposing them
[2:48:00.140 --> 2:48:04.820]  We have criminal investigation starting around the world the EU the head of Pfizer won't testify now
[2:48:05.020 --> 2:48:11.500]  So things clearly aren't going the way they thought it would but like any maglemaniac they feel invincible
[2:48:11.940 --> 2:48:15.100]  Where would you say their psychology is now and what they're planning next?
[2:48:16.740 --> 2:48:18.740]  Well, that's exactly
[2:48:18.740 --> 2:48:27.220]  You're right. They they see this thing crumbling crumbling because of our resistance
[2:48:28.140 --> 2:48:33.220]  pioneered to a good extent because you've been so kind as to have me on
[2:48:33.620 --> 2:48:37.820]  on your program repeatedly since the beginning of the
[2:48:38.540 --> 2:48:44.500]  Pandemic and so now instead of backing off since they crossed the Rubicon
[2:48:44.500 --> 2:48:50.620]  They are doubling down tripling down with the Biden executive order calling for
[2:48:51.220 --> 2:48:52.340]  more
[2:48:52.340 --> 2:48:58.380]  Offensive biological warfare weapons that would produce new pandemics and now this
[2:48:59.100 --> 2:49:05.180]  WHO treaty that will set up a global medical police state
[2:49:06.300 --> 2:49:09.300]  And especially here in the United States of America
[2:49:09.300 --> 2:49:14.140]  They'll do an end run around our constitutional rights and indeed
[2:49:14.740 --> 2:49:19.700]  There is a Supreme Court case Missouri versus Holland saying that a
[2:49:20.180 --> 2:49:25.220]  Treaty can trump the 10th Amendment and they're aware of this. Biden's a lawyer
[2:49:25.660 --> 2:49:30.680]  His chief of staff Ron claim was behind me at Harvard Law School
[2:49:31.140 --> 2:49:37.420]  They're aware then that the only way they can make a legal end run around our
[2:49:37.420 --> 2:49:44.220]  State and local control of our public health to depart from CDC orders
[2:49:44.740 --> 2:49:49.740]  Is by means of a treaty and so they're going all out out to do that as well
[2:49:49.780 --> 2:49:55.020]  This is what faces us Alex and it's it's not just a medical
[2:49:55.820 --> 2:50:03.180]  Worldwide medical dictatorship, but it's clear we've discussed this before it's the depopulation agenda
[2:50:03.180 --> 2:50:12.580]  it's a one-two punch with COVID-19 and offensive biological warfare weapon with gain of function properties and
[2:50:12.740 --> 2:50:19.000]  Now they admit in the Biden executive order issued by Biden himself under his name
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:24.620]  they're going to develop more of these offense and biological warfare weapons and
[2:50:25.100 --> 2:50:29.900]  They're fully prepared to release them just like they released the
[2:50:29.900 --> 2:50:38.980]  Amerithrax anthrax attacks in October of 2001 and I was the first to blow the whistle on that
[2:50:39.860 --> 2:50:43.380]  November 1 2001 at a conference for the
[2:50:44.700 --> 2:50:49.020]  Council for Responsible Genetics at Harvard Divinity School
[2:50:49.300 --> 2:50:53.180]  So that that we're going to see more pandemics
[2:50:53.740 --> 2:50:58.700]  More death more Franken shots. I said very early on
[2:50:58.700 --> 2:51:01.700]  Given the nature of COVID-19
[2:51:02.540 --> 2:51:11.980]  Any so-called vaccines produced by big pharma will be more dangerous than than uses and that prediction has certainly
[2:51:12.340 --> 2:51:14.140]  Come through
[2:51:14.140 --> 2:51:18.780]  You know, you can add up for yourself. How many people have been
[2:51:19.260 --> 2:51:21.940]  murdered by these franken shots or
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:29.260]  Or severely disabled and we're only at the beginning of what we are going to see
[2:51:30.060 --> 2:51:38.300]  If we don't stop the franken shots sure and I told you before I helped defend captain doctor Yolanda Hewitt Vaughn
[2:51:39.020 --> 2:51:40.380]  from the
[2:51:40.380 --> 2:51:42.380]  anthrax and botulent
[2:51:42.820 --> 2:51:49.100]  Experimental franken shots and go for one of five hundred thousand troops us troops injected
[2:51:49.100 --> 2:51:56.140]  At least eleven thousand died and a hundred thousand were disabled and that's a floor
[2:51:56.420 --> 2:52:00.180]  Not a ceiling of what we are facing here
[2:52:00.180 --> 2:52:05.340]  Well, that's right and we helped you help defeat that previously and the public helped defeat it
[2:52:05.340 --> 2:52:10.700]  So we can defeat them. I mean, I think it's fair to say their power grab is not going as well as they wanted
[2:52:10.700 --> 2:52:11.380]  It's been terrible
[2:52:11.380 --> 2:52:17.060]  They killed a lot of people maimed a lot of people both with the franken shot and with the release of the virus, but
[2:52:17.060 --> 2:52:19.020]  How would you describe?
[2:52:19.020 --> 2:52:21.900]  We're there at right now because the public wants to know if we're winning or not
[2:52:21.900 --> 2:52:26.140]  I think there's real signs of global awakening and a lot of positive things happening
[2:52:26.140 --> 2:52:28.460]  But as you said, they're just doubling and trippling down
[2:52:28.460 --> 2:52:31.460]  But clearly they don't like it that it's in mainstream news that
[2:52:32.060 --> 2:52:38.020]  AstraZeneca admits it causes blood clots and you know Pfizer admits their shot doesn't work. I mean it really is blowing up in their face
[2:52:39.700 --> 2:52:41.700]  Alex we're in the fight of our lives
[2:52:41.700 --> 2:52:46.660]  Oh, this is basically a world war three that we're fighting right now
[2:52:47.460 --> 2:52:48.500]  on
[2:52:48.500 --> 2:52:54.060]  COVID-19 on the franken shots and on the next pandemic and
[2:52:54.660 --> 2:52:58.780]  Pandemics they'll continue to release pandemics on us
[2:52:59.300 --> 2:53:01.300]  to scare monger us
[2:53:01.780 --> 2:53:03.260]  into
[2:53:03.260 --> 2:53:05.260]  accepting this global medical
[2:53:05.780 --> 2:53:07.780]  tyranny and also to
[2:53:07.780 --> 2:53:15.340]  Reduce the population. I mean right now. We're talking at least maybe a million and a half a million and a half American dead Americans
[2:53:15.340 --> 2:53:18.300]  I'm not even talking about, you know people around the world
[2:53:19.100 --> 2:53:25.500]  A million and a half. I mean that's twice the the American Civil War right there and they're not going to stop
[2:53:25.780 --> 2:53:29.940]  We have to stop them the as I said before in my opinion
[2:53:30.620 --> 2:53:32.620]  we're dealing with
[2:53:32.740 --> 2:53:34.580]  people possessed by a
[2:53:34.580 --> 2:53:41.500]  Nazi mentality and we have to face up to this the infiltration of Nazi ideas Nazi philosophy
[2:53:42.300 --> 2:53:47.580]  Into our elite here in the United States of America. Yes
[2:53:49.500 --> 2:53:52.180]  Dr. Boyle we got about a minute and a half left closing comments
[2:53:54.860 --> 2:53:58.220]  Well as you said I think
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:54:02.820]  We've seen the beginning of the end here. We're seeing
[2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:04.820]  the forces of
[2:54:05.300 --> 2:54:12.980]  Resistance being mobilized all over the country. I hear from them all the time. I hear from many of your
[2:54:13.420 --> 2:54:20.780]  Listeners, I'm happy to talk to them. Many of them have gotten together have gotten to or gotten organized
[2:54:21.540 --> 2:54:24.260]  Bringing pressure on their state local
[2:54:24.860 --> 2:54:26.140]  County
[2:54:26.140 --> 2:54:29.900]  Prosecutors, I think if we can get one set of indictments for murder
[2:54:29.900 --> 2:54:35.740]  Uh, the whole house the whole house of cards will collapse. I don't think we have them on the runk
[2:54:35.940 --> 2:54:39.460]  But but this I hope is the beginning of the end Ellen
[2:54:40.940 --> 2:54:44.380]  So we're not winning yet, but we're fighting back and having some success
[2:54:45.340 --> 2:54:47.860]  We are yes, I think we are yes
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:52.140]  All right, where's the best place for people to reach you if they want to interview you or find your work
[2:54:52.140 --> 2:54:56.380]  They can search your name and find many of your books. Professor Francis say Boyle, but what else can they do?
[2:54:56.380 --> 2:55:00.540]  Oh, yeah, they can just Google my name and all my books come up and
[2:55:01.180 --> 2:55:06.380]  My email address is there sure. I'm happy to talk with anyone
[2:55:06.380 --> 2:55:09.100]  I talk with many people all over the country about
[2:55:09.420 --> 2:55:11.420]  Getting organized
[2:55:12.060 --> 2:55:16.220]  And getting these indictments you have my book of resisting
[2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:21.060]  Medical tyranny the legal case is all set out in there
[2:55:21.060 --> 2:55:27.580]  I would also recommend Bobby Kennedy jr.'s book the real Anthony Fauci
[2:55:27.780 --> 2:55:31.300]  There's a lot of documentation in their facts
[2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:34.980]  That you can use to to convince a
[2:55:35.660 --> 2:55:40.780]  Prosecutor to to get these indictments. Yes, well, I know you don't want to feel vindicated
[2:55:40.780 --> 2:55:44.460]  It's horrible to be proven right, but this is so nightmarish and it's out in the oven
[2:55:44.460 --> 2:55:46.900]  So at least we've got a fighting chance. Thank you, Dr. Well, appreciate the time
[2:55:46.900 --> 2:55:52.180]  Sure. Thanks for having me on again, Alex. Keep up the good work. I'll try sir. All right
[2:55:52.420 --> 2:55:55.140]  Robert Barnes is coming into co-hosts with me next hour
[2:55:55.860 --> 2:56:01.460]  And I'm going to Connecticut today for the show trial. They admit mainstream news that I'm not allowed to defend myself
[2:56:01.460 --> 2:56:04.100]  It's insane. I'm there just as a
[2:56:05.220 --> 2:56:08.100]  mannequin or or they can kind of fool the jury that
[2:56:08.660 --> 2:56:12.180]  That it's actually somehow a real trial, but I'm still going to go regardless and
[2:56:12.180 --> 2:56:16.740]  Fight him of the press conferences and the rest of it. So look for that tomorrow and Wednesday. I'll be back Thursday in studio

[2:56:25.700 --> 2:56:31.780]  They're going to come in more force injections if we don't expose them now. That's why this this broadcast is so important. So please

[2:57:56.740 --> 2:58:05.140]  We've broken together this family that is info wars. Think about how info wars is cited by joe rogan and tucker carlson
[2:58:05.540 --> 2:58:07.540]  balsun arrow and other foreign leaders
[2:58:07.940 --> 2:58:09.700]  like Nigel farage
[2:58:09.700 --> 2:58:11.700]  as being the main impetus
[2:58:12.420 --> 2:58:16.340]  Towards firing up their main base to defeat the new world order
[2:58:17.380 --> 2:58:20.420]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[2:58:20.420 --> 2:58:26.420]  Is because the viewers and listeners of the broadcast have taken action and supported this show

[3:00:14.500 --> 3:00:19.620]  You want to hear why they fear alex jones go to info wars.com and actually hear my show
[3:00:20.100 --> 3:00:26.020]  Watch what we say. Watch what we do. See what we really say. Are you concerned about being held in contempt of court?
[3:00:26.020 --> 3:00:32.500]  We've been covering it on court tv, you know the judge not happy this morning jones called the judge a tyrant
[3:00:32.500 --> 3:00:38.900]  This is have a steam of justice and this judge is a tyrant. You've called this judge tyrants, correct?
[3:00:39.300 --> 3:00:43.860]  Yes, okay, and you actually use that word a lot with your audience. You call people tyrants not him
[3:00:44.340 --> 3:00:50.500]  Only when they act like it. It was wild at times in connecticut today on his first day in the courtroom
[3:00:50.580 --> 3:00:55.140]  alex jones did what alex jones does. I didn't regenerate this. It was the first person to say it
[3:00:55.460 --> 3:01:01.060]  American governors didn't like being blamed for this as the left did so we rejected it mentally and said it must not be true
[3:01:01.060 --> 3:01:03.700]  Near the end of the day the whole thing devolved into chaos
[3:01:03.940 --> 3:01:08.020]  But i legitimately thought it might have been staged and i stand by that and i don't apologize for it
[3:01:08.180 --> 3:01:12.580]  And don't apologize this jones. Please don't apologize. No i've already apologized to the parents over and over again
[3:01:13.220 --> 3:01:15.620]  I don't apologize to you. Don't apologize to you
[3:01:16.100 --> 3:01:24.260]  Well jones talked over his own lawyers objections all day long often promoting his website or advertising the products he sells
[3:01:24.260 --> 3:01:30.900]  And you have the page on your website that's just for cryptocurrency donations, right? info wards dot com forward slash crypto
[3:01:31.460 --> 3:01:35.060]  They'll go advertising just there. Well, we're fighting the deep state. We need money. All right
[3:01:35.380 --> 3:01:42.340]  He mentioned his products the ones he pimps. He mentioned those over and over today. You sell a product called basically don't you?
[3:01:43.540 --> 3:01:52.020]  No, vasily. Thank you, vasily. He kept giving the url for his website out there. 1776coin.com is the website, right?
[3:01:52.020 --> 3:01:59.460]  Yes, it's also known as patriots collectibles.com 1776 20.com. I felt like I was in the middle of an infomercial
[3:01:59.940 --> 3:02:04.580]  That will end up as a clip on your show tonight. Your advertising frame for cryptocurrency page
[3:02:05.860 --> 3:02:07.860]  You know
[3:02:07.860 --> 3:02:13.220]  I mean, I mean people want to keep us in the fight. So I mean, I hope whoever the big whales are that give us money before
[3:02:13.220 --> 3:02:15.220]  Keep going. We'll just keep we'll just keep
[3:02:16.340 --> 3:02:18.340]  Minting money as you're in the sport
[3:02:18.340 --> 3:02:22.340]  Yes, he will care about the first amendment even during the course of this trial
[3:02:22.580 --> 3:02:28.020]  He's delegitimizing it on his show and at the same time he's selling products on the website
[3:02:28.340 --> 3:02:30.500]  I felt like I was in the middle of an infomercial
[3:02:36.420 --> 3:02:38.420]  I know joe
[3:02:38.180 --> 3:02:40.180]  He is a profoundly
[3:02:40.340 --> 3:02:42.340]  decent man guided by faith
[3:02:42.740 --> 3:02:46.260]  I know a lot of weed smokers and corn pop was a bad dude
[3:02:46.260 --> 3:02:48.260]  And he ran a bunch of bad boys
[3:02:48.900 --> 3:02:55.220]  Tell me if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or trump and you ain't black and he listens
[3:02:56.260 --> 3:02:58.260]  He will tell the truth
[3:03:06.260 --> 3:03:08.260]  Civilization will be over
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:15.380]  When this is done, I just want trump out, you know, I'm saying I just feel like his mouth gets us in trouble
[3:03:15.380 --> 3:03:20.100]  In trouble so much poor kids are just as bright and just as tall as white kids
[3:03:20.580 --> 3:03:23.220]  Why why can't we just work with each other? Why?
[3:03:24.260 --> 3:03:27.140]  And we can't these white supremacists
[3:03:28.500 --> 3:03:30.500]  Nazi sympathizers
[3:03:30.900 --> 3:03:36.100]  carrying Nazi flags. How dare you you're a lying dog-faced pony soldier
[3:03:40.580 --> 3:03:42.580]  God help us
[3:03:43.460 --> 3:03:45.220]  God
[3:03:45.220 --> 3:03:50.500]  Help us. I'm sorry. I'm gonna just last question. I'll take and I said I'm really gonna be in trouble
[3:03:51.060 --> 3:03:53.060]  Do you know that I stabbed my ass?
[3:03:56.100 --> 3:03:58.100]  My god
[3:04:02.660 --> 3:04:07.780]  Joe knows what it's like to struggle which is why he gives his personal phone number to kids
[3:04:08.260 --> 3:04:10.260]  Overcoming a stutter of their own
[3:04:10.580 --> 3:04:12.580]  So we're not gonna seek us actually
[3:04:12.580 --> 3:04:19.220]  Excuse me. We're under military attack. We're under military attack. We're under military attack
[3:04:19.300 --> 3:04:21.300]  Now Joe is not perfect
[3:04:21.460 --> 3:04:26.660]  And he'd be the first to tell you that we already have a n***a mare. We don't need any more n***a big shots
[3:04:30.340 --> 3:04:35.380]  You are quite you're a really dull class. I don't feel no ways tired
[3:04:36.020 --> 3:04:38.340]  I want to walk away from this place so bad
[3:04:39.060 --> 3:04:41.060]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
[3:04:41.060 --> 3:04:45.540]  And I'm happy to take questions if that's you I'm supposed to do nance. Whatever you want me to do
[3:04:49.460 --> 3:04:51.460]  Oh, oh, I'm in trouble
[3:04:51.940 --> 3:04:56.020]  We we are in an information war and we are losing that war

[3:06:12.660 --> 3:06:15.140]  Getting ready to get on an airplane in Florida, Connecticut
[3:06:15.140 --> 3:06:20.500]  For round two of show trial two robert barnes is here with us in the studio
[3:06:21.300 --> 3:06:23.540]  Costumes a lawyer great historian. Good friend of mine
[3:06:24.740 --> 3:06:29.060]  He represents the homage farmer facing gel time for selling his neighbors cheese and milk
[3:06:30.420 --> 3:06:33.460]  He can also talk about january 6 the election 36 days out
[3:06:34.020 --> 3:06:38.100]  And all these mainstream articles saying jones isn't allowed to defend himself
[3:06:38.100 --> 3:06:43.540]  But that's a good thing and how it's the new model of american justice robert barnes. What do you want to tackle first?
[3:06:43.540 --> 3:06:49.140]  Oh, well any of it is good. I mean, I think it's good to see mainstream media at least pick up on this reality of how
[3:06:49.780 --> 3:06:53.940]  Unusual this is acknowledge and admit that what's taking place in the trial in
[3:06:54.340 --> 3:07:00.500]  Connecticut like the trial in texas does not conform to the norms and the customs of american law
[3:07:00.980 --> 3:07:02.500]  Everybody I mean it's so common
[3:07:02.500 --> 3:07:07.460]  We say everybody's supposed to get their day in court that we talk about it in colloquial use
[3:07:07.540 --> 3:07:10.900]  We talk about it in regular arguments between friends and family
[3:07:10.900 --> 3:07:13.780]  We said I haven't had a chance to have my day in court yet
[3:07:14.100 --> 3:07:16.900]  And yet here you have a court obsessed with denying
[3:07:17.380 --> 3:07:20.740]  Alex jones and infa wars ever having a day in court
[3:07:21.060 --> 3:07:27.940]  And that's disturbing and unsettling beyond the concerns of the first amendment the second amendment the fourth amendment the fifth amendment
[3:07:28.100 --> 3:07:31.700]  The sixth amendment the seventh amendment all of which are at stake here
[3:07:32.020 --> 3:07:38.180]  And then you have to ask why and one part of why is weaponizing our legal system to breach all customs and norms
[3:07:38.180 --> 3:07:45.620]  When you have a government that's willing to commit high level terrorism by sabotaging the north stream pipelines
[3:07:45.860 --> 3:07:50.340]  As uh, lieutenant colonel mcgregor recognized today one of trump's top advisors
[3:07:50.420 --> 3:07:55.140]  We are the likely culprit anybody with common sense can see that hell the secretary of state admitted it
[3:07:55.220 --> 3:08:01.140]  Oh, he brags about it effectively talking about what a great opportunity it is and this comes on victoria newland predicting it
[3:08:01.380 --> 3:08:03.380]  president biden predicting it
[3:08:03.380 --> 3:08:10.900]  Uh, that's a disturbing breach of custom and practice to engage in high level terrorism state not just state sponsored terrorism
[3:08:11.140 --> 3:08:17.460]  State directed state coordinated state orchestrated terrorism against civilian infrastructure of an ally
[3:08:17.860 --> 3:08:21.300]  There's almost no recent example of this ever happening on this scale
[3:08:21.700 --> 3:08:27.300]  And it's part of a complete lack of respect for custom for norms for presidents
[3:08:27.300 --> 3:08:30.500]  All the things they accuse trump of is what they are doing. They're the tyrants
[3:08:30.500 --> 3:08:33.940]  I mean, let's read some of this. It should bring up my case first. Yeah, this is out of current.com
[3:08:34.180 --> 3:08:36.820]  Alex jones set to testify at san june information trial this week
[3:08:36.980 --> 3:08:38.500]  Here's what to know this week
[3:08:38.500 --> 3:08:44.580]  He may be the trial's last witness testifying in his own behalf under an unusual punitive ruling
[3:08:45.060 --> 3:08:48.900]  Against him by the presiding judge jones will be able to do little more
[3:08:49.300 --> 3:08:53.700]  Then urge the jury to limit the tens of millions of dollars the victims are seeking and damages
[3:08:54.260 --> 3:08:57.300]  While at the same time opening himself to another withering
[3:08:57.300 --> 3:09:05.220]  Examination by their lawyers judge barbara bellows default ruling sanctions jones for failing to participate in reciprocal
[3:09:05.700 --> 3:09:07.700]  exchange is not true
[3:09:07.700 --> 3:09:10.180]  Information with the victims in the run-up to the trial
[3:09:10.420 --> 3:09:14.820]  It settled the trial in favor of the victims families and the central point of their suit
[3:09:15.380 --> 3:09:19.700]  That jones false broadcasts of the case of the harassment or the cause and mental anguish
[3:09:19.940 --> 3:09:23.620]  They've suffered so they could sit up there and babble for hours to whatever they want
[3:09:23.620 --> 3:09:27.940]  But I can't talk other than yes. No, we don't know as just a this vestigial
[3:09:28.660 --> 3:09:34.980]  ceremonial thing up there jones and his company free speech systems have been prohibited from defending themselves under the default
[3:09:35.220 --> 3:09:41.060]  But they can minimize what they pay in his precarious punitive damages. Well, that's what the law says season. Let me do that
[3:09:41.460 --> 3:09:47.380]  No, in fact, it's extraordinary as they know this is unheard of. This is unparalleled. This is unprepared. You were saying this a year ago
[3:09:47.380 --> 3:09:50.180]  People didn't believe you. Yeah. Oh, yeah, they're like, oh no no one does that
[3:09:50.180 --> 3:09:56.500]  I it it's unbelievable. I mean, I've challenged everybody out there that thinks otherwise to find a single case
[3:09:56.740 --> 3:10:02.980]  Where this has ever happened in american law. By the way, I mean our lawyer my lawyer in canada kids had all these former current judges
[3:10:03.060 --> 3:10:06.820]  Calling and they've just said we can't believe this is happening. I mean, this is like insane
[3:10:06.980 --> 3:10:11.620]  It's an evisceration of what it means to have your day in court every american's supposed to have their day in court
[3:10:11.700 --> 3:10:18.900]  That's what our civil justice system is about and it's what the show trials in the in the soviet union in stasi germany and in cuba
[3:10:18.900 --> 3:10:25.460]  Well, as you said that the justice system's on trial absolutely the justice system is on trial and because what they never understood is
[3:10:25.700 --> 3:10:33.300]  Why did the show trials fail in places like communist cuba in places like the soviet union in places like stasi germany places like nazi germany
[3:10:33.700 --> 3:10:37.700]  It's because they thought that people had confidence in the outcome of a case
[3:10:38.260 --> 3:10:45.380]  Simply because the appearance of a trial occurred what they discovered is that isn't what creates confidence in the outcome of a case
[3:10:45.380 --> 3:10:51.140]  It's seeing actual day in court and you getting a chance to present your full argument. It's due process
[3:10:51.140 --> 3:10:52.020]  It's rule of law
[3:10:52.020 --> 3:10:56.580]  Seeing oj go free because they couldn't prove it though. We know he was guilty gave us confidence
[3:10:56.740 --> 3:11:00.900]  We weren't glad he went free, but it showed that there were a lot of checks and balances absolutely
[3:11:00.980 --> 3:11:06.580]  It's what the confidence comes from the process being done right and what they've done is they want the appearance of a trial
[3:11:06.900 --> 3:11:12.740]  Without the reality of a trial so it's it's not just the complete unusual manner in which you're not allowed
[3:11:12.740 --> 3:11:15.700]  You're basically gagged from defending yourself dozens of things
[3:11:15.700 --> 3:11:19.940]  I can't say not that I'm broke not that I'm in bankruptcy not that I barely ever covered it
[3:11:20.260 --> 3:11:23.380]  Not not that no no they can babble on each witness for days
[3:11:23.860 --> 3:11:29.620]  But I am limited in what I can say and the plaintiff's lawyer can put up lie after lie after lie after lie
[3:11:29.700 --> 3:11:32.980]  Which is what this plaintiff's lawyer has done they can put up hillary and obama
[3:11:32.980 --> 3:11:34.340]  But then I can't talk about it
[3:11:34.340 --> 3:11:37.380]  No, I mean they get to put up and say oh look at gross revenues
[3:11:37.380 --> 3:11:40.740]  But we even they have no evidence that any of it ties to sandy hook
[3:11:40.740 --> 3:11:43.700]  You're not allowed to say no no that has anything to do with sandy hook
[3:11:44.100 --> 3:11:49.540]  It's entirely about a show trial so that you're up there effectively gagged from defending yourself
[3:11:49.780 --> 3:11:55.380]  And it's just let's look at the public shaming the public humiliation the public attack to make it appear
[3:11:55.780 --> 3:12:02.020]  That there was a substantive trial without an actual substantive trial all the rules of evidence are being eviscerated here
[3:12:02.260 --> 3:12:06.260]  90 percent of the evidence I've seen in the case has nothing to do with the plaintiff's damages
[3:12:06.340 --> 3:12:08.180]  And what about their claim we didn't give them discovery
[3:12:08.180 --> 3:12:11.780]  And that has always been false because and and and we talked about it from the get go
[3:12:11.780 --> 3:12:15.940]  I said where this case is going is the they're going their whole theory was wrong
[3:12:16.020 --> 3:12:20.340]  Their whole theory was based on a lot because they would demand give us the proof you made money out of sand here doesn't exist default
[3:12:20.660 --> 3:12:26.100]  Exactly and it was every time you said they said give us the proof that you're guilty of this caricature
[3:12:26.180 --> 3:12:31.860]  We've created of you. You're like I'm not that caricature. I'm innocent. That's grounds for default judge
[3:12:31.940 --> 3:12:37.140]  He's he's asserting his innocence default him as a matter of law. That's how insane this was
[3:12:37.140 --> 3:12:42.740]  You can't find a compare comparable case in america where this has ever happened and they're admitting this is a case
[3:12:43.540 --> 3:12:46.260]  A test case. Oh, absolutely. They're gonna do this
[3:12:46.820 --> 3:12:52.580]  Just as we're seeing with the bite administration rating a former president of the united states and putting them under criminal investigation
[3:12:52.820 --> 3:12:58.660]  We have the oath keepers subject to a trial and with a jury pool that makes 1950s birmingham
[3:12:58.980 --> 3:13:02.420]  Look like a beacon of impartiality makes the tequila mockingbird
[3:13:02.420 --> 3:13:07.220]  A verdict jury pool look wonderful. That's that we're seeing this across the board
[3:13:07.380 --> 3:13:12.820]  We're seeing the evisceration of all the customs and practices and traditions and precedents that made america america
[3:13:12.900 --> 3:13:17.940]  That made american law such a beacon for the whole entire world to want to emulate
[3:13:18.180 --> 3:13:22.820]  That's what's being attacked here. Not just alex jones. Not just the first amendment not just the second amendment
[3:13:22.980 --> 3:13:27.220]  It's your day. It's your right to have your day in court. That's what they're taking away
[3:13:27.220 --> 3:13:34.820]  I don't want to be over optimistic because I don't have the money. They're gonna get their rigged thing or probably 100 million dollars. God knows what
[3:13:35.620 --> 3:13:36.580]  but
[3:13:36.580 --> 3:13:38.740]  The public is starting to figure out this is rigged
[3:13:39.380 --> 3:13:42.660]  And the judge seems pretty freaked out as he realizes that yeah, I think that the
[3:13:43.140 --> 3:13:51.860]  Extraordinary coverage that's taken place a wide range of independent legal commentators are saying that even or institutional media is now admitting it and conceding it
[3:13:52.180 --> 3:13:55.140]  Anybody who watches this says it's even worse than I described it
[3:13:55.140 --> 3:13:59.780]  And so all kinds of people lawyers included been watching this and saying they've never seen anything like this
[3:14:00.100 --> 3:14:04.500]  They've never seen what is it the clearly a show trial in america. We've never had those
[3:14:04.740 --> 3:14:07.700]  We've had trials. We've had trials that were politically motivated
[3:14:07.700 --> 3:14:12.180]  We've had trials with corrupted jury pools, but we've never had a pure show trial
[3:14:12.340 --> 3:14:16.900]  Where only one side is allowed to present evidence even if it doesn't relate to it. They find you guilty
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:21.060]  They say you're guilty they can run on each witness saying whatever they want with no proof for days
[3:14:21.060 --> 3:14:25.940]  They can bring in new evidence wherever they want. We can put in no evidence. They admit that and we've got to say we're guilty
[3:14:26.260 --> 3:14:29.300]  Exactly. I mean, I mean it is the definition of a show trial
[3:14:29.700 --> 3:14:33.700]  And we just have never had those in america and they're now exploring the capacity to use them
[3:14:33.940 --> 3:14:38.180]  And if they can get away with it in a high-profile case, they assume they can use it against anybody else
[3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:42.900]  So we have these rules of evidence for a reason. They're there to make sure both sides get their day in court
[3:14:42.900 --> 3:14:47.380]  Those rules are being eviscerated. There's an example in the texas case all court in it rather the same way
[3:14:47.380 --> 3:14:52.500]  They would play an edited five-second clip. We say we have the full clip. The judges say no, you can't play it
[3:14:53.060 --> 3:14:56.820]  That's the rule of optional completeness explain it. Oh completely. So the the rule of completeness
[3:14:56.900 --> 3:15:00.500]  I used in the what uh, was the snipe's trial to get in all the evidence the very beginning of the case
[3:15:00.900 --> 3:15:05.220]  Uh rule 106 under the federal rules of evidence. It has its analog analogous context everywhere
[3:15:05.380 --> 3:15:08.420]  It's to make sure that your statement is taken in context
[3:15:08.740 --> 3:15:14.660]  I think there's a currently comedic meme going around of senator kennedy from louisiana about if you took him out of context
[3:15:14.660 --> 3:15:19.220]  It sounds crazy. So the it's the same principle that the rule of completeness
[3:15:19.540 --> 3:15:23.940]  Means you can't take any portion out of the context in which it's being presented
[3:15:24.340 --> 3:15:26.340]  And so in order to say if I said
[3:15:26.980 --> 3:15:31.060]  Uh, if I were a commie that and they played I am a commie
[3:15:31.380 --> 3:15:35.460]  That's an example of denial the rule of completeness. It gives a misleading impression
[3:15:35.780 --> 3:15:39.140]  And they did it to me that they did it to my commentary about the court
[3:15:39.380 --> 3:15:43.620]  They excluded the relevant part which showed why the texas case was also a show trial
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:48.500]  These are both show trials. They're a disgrace to them. Well, these people know what they're doing. They're coordinated and
[3:15:48.900 --> 3:15:52.340]  They mean to take the country down. They mean to take you down. Well, they're not back. Stay with us

[3:20:15.700 --> 3:20:19.460]  They're not just coming for info wars not just coming for the amish
[3:20:21.140 --> 3:20:23.140]  They're coming for a whole future and our children
[3:20:23.140 --> 3:20:26.900]  Robert barnes finishing up with my kangaroo case then you're representing
[3:20:27.540 --> 3:20:31.620]  The amish guy that got ready for selling milk to his neighbors and all that's happening there
[3:20:31.700 --> 3:20:35.860]  I mean, this is just a full court attack. He was selling fentanyl to kids. He'd be a lot of jail
[3:20:36.660 --> 3:20:39.940]  Sadly, I mean that that's where we're at. We're we're at just total control
[3:20:39.940 --> 3:20:45.620]  You're the food and drug administration helping to force vaccines on children that are not actually vaccines that are not safe
[3:20:45.620 --> 3:20:49.780]  They're not effective you have the state court systems in two different states
[3:20:49.780 --> 3:20:57.620]  Attempting to create through the alex jones case as a template of show trials to legitimate future show trials against dissident americans
[3:20:57.940 --> 3:21:01.860]  You have the president united states engaging in global terrorism effectively
[3:21:02.180 --> 3:21:03.380]  wide-scale
[3:21:03.380 --> 3:21:10.580]  Sabotage of a major and energy pipeline to a major ally to propagate a globalist war in
[3:21:10.820 --> 3:21:12.660]  ukraine and in europe
[3:21:12.660 --> 3:21:16.660]  And and all of this comes together with the u.s. Department of Agriculture
[3:21:16.660 --> 3:21:22.820]  Trying to control what food we eat to give you an example one of the things they wanted in the amos miller case
[3:21:23.300 --> 3:21:28.260]  Was an order folks that don't know talk about the case because you're representing sure so amos miller is an amish farmer
[3:21:28.340 --> 3:21:32.260]  Comes from a has is growing food and making food, but you know beef
[3:21:32.980 --> 3:21:34.020]  poultry
[3:21:34.020 --> 3:21:38.740]  Eggs dairy you name it in the same way his community of faith has for centuries
[3:21:39.220 --> 3:21:42.260]  And in fact, this is exactly what all of his consumers want
[3:21:42.260 --> 3:21:48.420]  Uh, he doesn't sell into the retail markets at your local grocery store across. No, they fear as direct consumers
[3:21:48.980 --> 3:21:52.260]  Absolutely, because we'll all move back to the country. That's where you get the food completely
[3:21:52.660 --> 3:21:56.100]  If they can control what goes into our body, whether it's the u.s
[3:21:56.980 --> 3:22:03.940]  FDA or the u.s. Department of Agriculture, they control us and what you have is very at least look at the amish community as a whole
[3:22:04.260 --> 3:22:09.940]  By almost every biological metric. They are healthier than the rest of america. They have been now for autism doesn't exist
[3:22:09.940 --> 3:22:16.100]  At very low levels. I mean basically you have almost every metric in the last 50 years
[3:22:16.900 --> 3:22:19.060]  The the amish community is doing better than us
[3:22:19.380 --> 3:22:23.540]  Why is it because maybe they don't take u.s. Department of Agriculture food?
[3:22:23.860 --> 3:22:26.980]  Is it because they don't do it the way the big ag wants us to do it?
[3:22:27.220 --> 3:22:31.780]  They don't do it the way bill gates with his synthetic corn and fake meat want to put on our plates
[3:22:32.180 --> 3:22:35.300]  And so the key competitor to the bill gates of the world the key
[3:22:35.300 --> 3:22:41.220]  Outlier testing the established power of the u.s. Department of Agriculture to control our food and what we eat
[3:22:41.700 --> 3:22:45.060]  Are the examples of amas miller where you have a community of private membership?
[3:22:45.700 --> 3:22:50.580]  Association of people who've come together and say we want food the way the at this community of faith makes the food
[3:22:50.740 --> 3:22:55.140]  We don't want it the way the Department of Agriculture makes it and they're afraid of that catching on
[3:22:55.380 --> 3:22:56.100]  Absolutely
[3:22:56.100 --> 3:22:58.580]  It is the most powerful competitor because they see this community
[3:22:58.900 --> 3:23:04.260]  Creating food that people like that they enjoy and that makes them healthier and that makes that
[3:23:04.260 --> 3:23:07.940]  Terrifies so they wanted soros marijuana or fentanyl it'd be fine
[3:23:07.940 --> 3:23:11.860]  But if you want milk or cheese or eggs, it's over exactly especially done in an organic
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:15.140]  Authentic original way without a bunch of chemicals stuck on it
[3:23:15.380 --> 3:23:22.260]  So the people who order food for amas miller want and demand that it be made outside of usda control
[3:23:22.580 --> 3:23:24.420]  That's driven the usda nuts
[3:23:24.420 --> 3:23:31.140]  So they brought suit after suit after suit legal claim after legal claim after legal claim seizure after seizure after seizure
[3:23:31.140 --> 3:23:35.140]  And now on on halloween of this year. He has a hearing in federal court
[3:23:35.620 --> 3:23:39.780]  Where what is the government requesting the government is requesting that amas miller go to prison?
[3:23:40.340 --> 3:23:44.500]  Until unless he complies with what they demand he do pay certain monies
[3:23:44.500 --> 3:23:48.500]  They're wanting to add his wife as you know going to show trials and do process
[3:23:48.820 --> 3:23:52.580]  His wife has never been part of this case. They're trying to out now this they can't break him
[3:23:52.580 --> 3:23:58.020]  They want to go after his wife and automatically true terrorists absolutely and they automatically add her to the judgment without any due process
[3:23:58.020 --> 3:24:03.460]  She would never get the right to discovery never get the right to hearing never get the right to a trial never get and again
[3:24:03.460 --> 3:24:08.900]  These are big monetary judgments 300,000. There's talk of seven million dollars bankrupting kind of judgment
[3:24:08.900 --> 3:24:11.860]  Here's one pay 300,000 dollars or go to jail exactly now
[3:24:12.180 --> 3:24:18.980]  Well, how does a 300,000 dollar monetary judgment happen in a case where there's never been a trial by jury in a federal district court
[3:24:19.380 --> 3:24:22.660]  How is this this case even concerning interstate commerce?
[3:24:22.660 --> 3:24:29.700]  Which all the u.s. Department of Agriculture's power is limited to food being shipped across state lines for commercial purposes
[3:24:29.940 --> 3:24:35.540]  When this is then that isn't what's happening here fundamentally. He's not sending it's supposed to protect the consumer
[3:24:35.700 --> 3:24:40.420]  So the consumer knows what they're getting and the left lies and say he was tied to a posterior outbreak not true
[3:24:40.580 --> 3:24:44.900]  There's no evidence of that that i've seen whatsoever. There's no consumer complaining here none
[3:24:45.220 --> 3:24:48.740]  There's none. He's never been sued by any consumer of his food ever
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:54.740]  So it's like why is the u.s. Department of Agriculture trying to put an homage farmer in prison for making food that people demand
[3:24:54.740 --> 3:24:58.820]  He making the way he's making both the same way these leftist lawyers attacked me were selling supplements
[3:24:59.300 --> 3:25:05.060]  That aren't FDA approved. No supplements are FDA approved. They tried to ban them in 96 congress passed a law saying you have no jurisdiction
[3:25:05.620 --> 3:25:06.340]  FDA
[3:25:06.340 --> 3:25:09.140]  Oh, well in fact in the district of columbia today, by the way
[3:25:09.620 --> 3:25:15.380]  Established that you can sue as false trade any store that puts
[3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:20.820]  Uh, non FDA approved products on this on the same shelf as FDA approved products
[3:25:20.820 --> 3:25:23.460]  The district of columbia has ruled that today that that is well
[3:25:23.460 --> 3:25:26.740]  They should just separate and say not not at the approved everybody'll go to that one
[3:25:26.980 --> 3:25:32.740]  The exactly the uh, and if you have it anywhere near or if you have it under the category of medicine
[3:25:33.060 --> 3:25:36.420]  If you have it at this is the same FDA that told us the shots were safe
[3:25:36.660 --> 3:25:40.580]  Exactly the same FDA that has been hiding autopsy reports now for years
[3:25:40.580 --> 3:25:45.220]  The same FDA that i'm suing up in the western district of texas because they approved this
[3:25:45.620 --> 3:25:50.580]  Vaccine when it wasn't a vaccine wasn't safe wasn't effective and worse. They lied about it
[3:25:50.660 --> 3:25:54.020]  I mean if they hadn't lied about it a different story, but they let's expand on that
[3:25:54.660 --> 3:25:59.540]  How is it going for them because it's coming out the shots make you sick kill you its mainstream news
[3:25:59.860 --> 3:26:02.660]  Howard, what are they gonna? This is not going the way they want not at all
[3:26:02.820 --> 3:26:05.860]  It's been a complete backfire and i mean for there's more suits coming
[3:26:06.100 --> 3:26:09.460]  There's suits coming about people who suffered in debilitating injuries
[3:26:09.460 --> 3:26:15.380]  There's been a surge in disability claims and in groups that have taken the vaccine at a high rate
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:18.340]  There's of course the actuarial tables of insurance payouts
[3:26:18.580 --> 3:26:23.140]  Insurance companies are now going to congress begging for a bailout because of how much money they've had to pay
[3:26:23.140 --> 3:26:26.500]  Due to death and disability claims arising from use of the vaccine
[3:26:26.900 --> 3:26:30.660]  So you would i mean sweet and now astrazeneca admits. Okay our shot causes blood clots
[3:26:30.820 --> 3:26:35.620]  Not only that you have norwegian you now have norway and sweden saying this shouldn't be given to most healthy people
[3:26:35.620 --> 3:26:39.940]  This shouldn't be given to kids. This shouldn't be given to people under 65 revoking it off
[3:26:39.940 --> 3:26:45.060]  So what is fouchy and borla and others gates hope we just forget about it because we're not
[3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.980]  They're hoping that the court system continues to cover up for them
[3:26:48.980 --> 3:26:53.700]  I mean that's really it at the end of the day. They're hoping that the court system doesn't hold them accountable
[3:26:54.260 --> 3:27:01.220]  We have a big case brought for brook jackson the whistleblower against fizer pending in the eastern district of texas and the bowmont division
[3:27:01.220 --> 3:27:05.620]  Uh, we'll see what happens there. Uh, there's been a lot of anomalies is what's taking place
[3:27:05.780 --> 3:27:13.220]  It turned out the fizer's local lawyer went and hired brook jackson's former local lawyer and then pretended this was all normal
[3:27:13.780 --> 3:27:19.380]  Uh, so you're seeing all of these whether it's the aim is miller case whether it's your case whether it's the trump raid case
[3:27:19.380 --> 3:27:24.820]  Whether it's the genuine total weaponization of the judiciary. Absolutely. It's turning on the full spigots
[3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:30.820]  No restriction. No restraint weaponize the legal system to go after dissidents to go after behaviors
[3:27:30.820 --> 3:27:35.460]  They don't like so they can have total global control while there's no accountability for them
[3:27:35.700 --> 3:27:38.180]  No accountability for what do we the people do to counter that?
[3:27:38.580 --> 3:27:42.740]  Continue to educate people in the court of public opinion so that we can get the reform and remedy
[3:27:42.740 --> 3:27:49.620]  We need at both the judicial and legislative levels because that's the most practical and effective way to get the change that we need
[3:27:49.620 --> 3:27:51.540]  Is it fair to say they bet off more than they can chew?
[3:27:51.700 --> 3:27:56.260]  Oh, they definitely did and I think they're they never expected this degree of public blowback
[3:27:56.260 --> 3:28:02.180]  They never expected this degree when you have prominent english doctors british doctors who were some of the biggest
[3:28:02.660 --> 3:28:10.260]  Propagandist and pushers for this vaccine now going on a public campaign saying they were wrong saying that this was a bad idea
[3:28:10.260 --> 3:28:15.700]  That's right. They attempt to intimidate medical professionals has exponentially triggered others in the public. Oh, exactly
[3:28:15.700 --> 3:28:19.380]  And in california where they just passed a bevy of crazy laws
[3:28:19.620 --> 3:28:22.820]  But one of the crazy laws they passed is banning is basically
[3:28:22.820 --> 3:28:28.900]  De-licensing doctors. This is the misuse and abuse of licensing power that some of us have been warning about for decades
[3:28:29.220 --> 3:28:34.740]  Now that basically if you're a doctor and you say something the stake doesn't approve of they can take away your medical license
[3:28:35.140 --> 3:28:38.180]  Like the vaccine doesn't work exactly which is true
[3:28:38.500 --> 3:28:44.340]  Correct or saying it's not really a vaccine doesn't work as a vaccine doesn't inoculate you like a vaccine
[3:28:44.340 --> 3:28:46.020]  It's a they're trying to bring in a new dark age

[3:33:29.380 --> 3:33:31.380]  You host
[3:33:31.300 --> 3:33:33.300]  Imagine what it's like
[3:33:34.740 --> 3:33:37.300]  Being 34 people held for more than a year and a half
[3:33:38.100 --> 3:33:42.100]  In solitary confinement the facility described worse far worse
[3:33:43.060 --> 3:33:45.060]  than guantanamo bay
[3:33:45.380 --> 3:33:48.580]  Breaking 34 us political presence is on info wars dot com
[3:33:49.140 --> 3:33:55.220]  In dc gulag demand transferred to guantanamo bay to escape intolerable conditions and heartbreaking letter
[3:33:55.220 --> 3:34:03.620]  24 us political prisoners of the biden administration penned a very sad letter this week requesting a transfer to guantanamo bay
[3:34:04.020 --> 3:34:10.020]  Human facility where they would receive meals sunlight freedom of religion exercise entertainment and even be treated like human beings
[3:34:10.580 --> 3:34:15.140]  The 34 january 6 political prisoners have been held for more than a year and a half without trial
[3:34:15.460 --> 3:34:17.860]  Permissive meaners and trumped up felony charges
[3:34:18.580 --> 3:34:22.500]  The group of men have been isolated beaten somehow in their eyes gouged out
[3:34:22.500 --> 3:34:24.980]  Visually because they're white it is racist attacks
[3:34:25.460 --> 3:34:31.300]  Abused threatened tormented and belittled by guards based on their political religious and racial background
[3:34:32.020 --> 3:34:37.460]  The men and women have been without medical assistance medications exercise and most of these men have been held in isolation
[3:34:37.620 --> 3:34:42.980]  With little human contact for months at a time and then it has the letter we'll put on screen if you can guys
[3:34:43.620 --> 3:34:45.940]  It's a link to the article as a scribe deal
[3:34:46.500 --> 3:34:50.260]  You can see the handwritten letter because they're not even given access to word
[3:34:50.260 --> 3:34:56.020]  Processing ladies and gentlemen. I mean this is beyond evil. So if you guys go to the gateway put an article
[3:34:56.980 --> 3:34:58.660]  Halfway into it. There it is
[3:34:58.660 --> 3:35:01.700]  There is the hand written letter all signed by them
[3:35:02.020 --> 3:35:06.020]  Reportedly took them months to be able to get it around everybody because the guards wouldn't even let them do it
[3:35:06.660 --> 3:35:08.900]  Uh, and when they beg for food and water
[3:35:09.380 --> 3:35:15.060]  Are they the toilets overflow that they feed them like twice a day? There's mold everywhere cockroaches flies
[3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:18.500]  Owen's been in that jail. He says you wake up and roaches are all over you
[3:35:18.500 --> 3:35:23.460]  They just laugh at you and say die honky die and it is true. They have basically like a nazi
[3:35:24.020 --> 3:35:26.820]  Black azog battalion and they're ruling over the facility
[3:35:27.220 --> 3:35:28.820]  Uh, robert barns
[3:35:28.820 --> 3:35:30.820]  Uh, it's frightening. I mean not only that they're
[3:35:31.380 --> 3:35:37.860]  Resurrecting claims that have we're supposed to be dead things like felony obstruction charges things like felony sedition charges
[3:35:38.100 --> 3:35:41.380]  The last time this was utilized much in america was during world war one
[3:35:41.700 --> 3:35:46.420]  They used it against you Eugene v. Debs a you know who ran for president of the united states
[3:35:46.420 --> 3:35:48.420]  Uh, who had actually
[3:35:48.580 --> 3:35:52.660]  Obtained a record level of support for us for a small third party at that time
[3:35:52.980 --> 3:35:55.700]  They put him in prison just just because he spoke out against the war
[3:35:56.020 --> 3:36:02.260]  We forget that because america has mostly suppressed that history our institutional narrators don't share that history
[3:36:02.500 --> 3:36:08.580]  They're trying to resurrect that they're trying to use the january 6 riots as an excuse and a pretext
[3:36:08.820 --> 3:36:14.740]  To bring back sedition laws in america to bring back obstruction laws in america that say if you disagree with us
[3:36:14.740 --> 3:36:17.780]  That's obstruction of justice and the outlaw their political opposition
[3:36:18.340 --> 3:36:23.060]  Um, what do you make with 36 days out what they're going to try to pull?
[3:36:23.860 --> 3:36:28.420]  That's going to be interesting. I mean, I think they have convinced themselves in part that they are going to prevail
[3:36:28.820 --> 3:36:31.460]  And that is a mistake and a misjudgment on their part
[3:36:31.540 --> 3:36:33.540]  I think they democrats are in severe
[3:36:33.860 --> 3:36:37.460]  Trouble in the house and the senate and the governorships and the state legislatures
[3:36:37.460 --> 3:36:44.420]  But I think because they have convinced themselves that they might win that has delayed what might otherwise be an october surprise
[3:36:44.740 --> 3:36:50.020]  But you know when they're going out doing things like the sabotage of the north stream pipeline
[3:36:50.340 --> 3:36:55.780]  You can't rule anything out. Uh, you have people talking about tactical use of nuclear weapons
[3:36:56.180 --> 3:37:00.980]  Uh, so you can't they're mad dogs complete. These are people that have no respect for limits
[3:37:01.300 --> 3:37:03.940]  Just like your trial has no respect for the rule of the law
[3:37:03.940 --> 3:37:10.420]  Just like the january 6 cases have no respect for basic human rights. How do they all get together and just suddenly engage in criminal activity?
[3:37:10.820 --> 3:37:12.820]  It's a complete lack of self-restraint
[3:37:13.220 --> 3:37:16.500]  That's that it is a culture that lacks self-restraint
[3:37:16.580 --> 3:37:20.980]  It is a culture that has irrigated to itself power the constitution never gave it
[3:37:21.380 --> 3:37:27.140]  But doesn't recognize or realize the problematic aspects of breaching these limits and customs. It's the french revolution
[3:37:27.380 --> 3:37:31.620]  Right, I mean, and i'm afraid of the right wing backlash. I don't even I see this is
[3:37:31.620 --> 3:37:38.900]  Uh, this is bad. Anyway, slice it if there's escalations or the point where they try to steal elections in 2022
[3:37:39.300 --> 3:37:44.100]  Where they do something crazy like use weapons or try to start world war three for real
[3:37:44.580 --> 3:37:50.740]  Then I think you're going to see a public backlash all around the globe and who knows where that goes and it can go in very dangerous
[3:37:51.140 --> 3:37:55.780]  Directions, that's where we it's our constitutional democracy has every solution for any problem
[3:37:55.780 --> 3:37:58.020]  We currently face it's resorting to it
[3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:03.460]  But it needs to step up and that means the courts need to step up legislators need to see we have checks and balances and
[3:38:03.460 --> 3:38:06.740]  Chivalry to protect us all absolutely and you know the you know
[3:38:07.300 --> 3:38:10.500]  All the way back. This was the foundation of how we solve any problem
[3:38:10.500 --> 3:38:15.300]  We resort to the constitutional means to do so but they've been losing culturally and politically so they're
[3:38:15.700 --> 3:38:19.460]  Overturning the chessboard. What about the oath keeper show trial beginning?
[3:38:19.700 --> 3:38:25.060]  I mean it's sad because I mean it's absurd that there's a sedition trial going on related to january 6th
[3:38:25.060 --> 3:38:29.860]  Especially when we compare it and contrast it to the so-called summer of love of 2020
[3:38:30.100 --> 3:38:37.780]  Where there was riots politically motivated riots all across the united states including in the district of columbia and the vice president bailing out
[3:38:38.500 --> 3:38:39.700]  people that
[3:38:39.700 --> 3:38:45.300]  Engaged in muggings and shootings in arson and then went out and committed rape and other crimes after they were got out on bail
[3:38:45.380 --> 3:38:49.060]  Thanks to her and thanks to other bail reforms in america that have been passed by the left
[3:38:49.060 --> 3:38:56.020]  And while these folks many of whom just walked in and took photos and stayed walking between the lines are facing
[3:38:56.660 --> 3:39:01.220]  Obstruction of congress charges are facing suggestion charges. This is insane
[3:39:01.300 --> 3:39:04.660]  Now what it shows is how dangerous our deep state has become the trial
[3:39:04.660 --> 3:39:09.860]  They're not paying attention to is the one of the fbi agent in la who was implicated tied to the national
[3:39:09.940 --> 3:39:14.500]  Who was a national security agent for the fbi was working in moonlighting for the armenian mob
[3:39:14.500 --> 3:39:20.900]  Was a key fundraiser for the clinton's obamas and Gavin Newsom through a corrupt law firm that had bogus lawyers on there
[3:39:21.060 --> 3:39:24.660]  The american media is not covering that mainstream media is not covering that story
[3:39:24.900 --> 3:39:32.580]  Instead they're highlighting the scapegoating of a couple of ordinary people who committed at worst in many cases simple trespass
[3:39:32.660 --> 3:39:34.660]  Is america a banana republic
[3:39:35.140 --> 3:39:36.740]  They would make it so
[3:39:36.740 --> 3:39:40.820]  And and it will only become so if there's not enough pushback in the court of public opinion
[3:39:40.820 --> 3:39:45.460]  If there's not enough conscientious courts and legislators that don't step. I mean just look at
[3:39:45.860 --> 3:39:49.300]  Kamala Harris says our greatest ally is north korea in the pacific
[3:39:49.860 --> 3:39:54.820]  She can hardly talk biden can't talk. I mean, this is ridiculous. Oh completely. I mean, you've got a corrupt
[3:39:55.300 --> 3:40:01.940]  Uh governor in the in in california who's considered candidate number three saying kids can come there and be sterilized without critical consent
[3:40:02.580 --> 3:40:06.740]  Oh, I mean it's like if you were trying to paint yourself as a devil you'd act like them
[3:40:06.740 --> 3:40:13.620]  Oh, yeah, pass some of the laws. They did you know not allowing autopsies about whether someone killed their committed infanticide in california
[3:40:13.860 --> 3:40:18.420]  Baining doctors from saying dissident speech at the threat of losing their medical license
[3:40:18.660 --> 3:40:24.260]  These are insane policies that are being propounded and proposed and pushed through by the left and what's crazy is if you look at the graph
[3:40:24.340 --> 3:40:26.340]  They're going straight up. They're not
[3:40:26.340 --> 3:40:28.900]  Slowing down. They're getting crazier and crazier
[3:40:29.540 --> 3:40:32.900]  Isn't that what psychos and losers do though? They try to destroy themselves
[3:40:32.900 --> 3:40:38.660]  It's like the zodiac killers are sitting letters the cops trying to get caught or you want us to stop them like ted bundy
[3:40:38.980 --> 3:40:46.500]  Uh, I mean ted bundy, you know can kept committing spontaneous crimes that were unplanned in such a way that he was inevitably going to get caught
[3:40:46.740 --> 3:40:52.180]  It's sociopathic behavior. It's borderline behavior. We have a delusional dementia candidate in the white house
[3:40:52.340 --> 3:40:56.660]  We have an assistant is one of the dumbest. They'd be still the dumbest lawyer I ever dealt with in quay
[3:40:56.660 --> 3:41:02.820]  We have mass inflation and I notice on twitter and everywhere the left defended it and said we didn't blow up the Nord Stream too
[3:41:02.820 --> 3:41:06.420]  But it needs to be blown up and now even when the democrat leaders admit they blew it up
[3:41:06.740 --> 3:41:10.500]  You will be sensitive. You say they blew it up exactly and at the same time
[3:41:10.500 --> 3:41:15.380]  They're talking about a Lehman moment with major banks like Deutsche bank and credit suise

[3:45:17.380 --> 3:45:19.380]  like nigel forage

[3:47:12.660 --> 3:47:17.380]  Welcome back to the alex jones show. This is robert barns guest hosting this last segment
[3:47:18.260 --> 3:47:22.660]  We're going to be discussing a little bit is putin right when he says the western elites
[3:47:22.660 --> 3:47:27.620]  Have a long history of seeing the world in an exploitive terms for their own self-interest
[3:47:27.940 --> 3:47:33.300]  When he calls them satanist in their cultural agenda in their woke religious beliefs
[3:47:33.780 --> 3:47:39.460]  And does that reflect what is taking place in ukraine more than what we've heard from the institutional press
[3:47:40.180 --> 3:47:45.460]  But before that let's talk about ways that a lot of times people ask me how can they
[3:47:45.460 --> 3:47:52.660]  Support the cause how can they support info wars and the message being communicated and spread how they can make sure
[3:47:53.060 --> 3:47:55.060]  That info war stays on the air
[3:47:55.380 --> 3:48:00.900]  Well, there's three ways to do so ways that make you healthier wealthier and wiser on average
[3:48:01.140 --> 3:48:10.820]  Simply by partaking in participating in this self-supported community this self-supported economy this self sustaining independent media infrastructure
[3:48:10.820 --> 3:48:17.620]  That is free of corporate control that is free of sponsor or or sugar daddy money
[3:48:17.860 --> 3:48:22.340]  That doesn't rely upon big pharma one of the ironies throughout the trial
[3:48:22.980 --> 3:48:28.180]  Has been watching the plaintiff's lawyer make it look bad that info wars sells products
[3:48:28.420 --> 3:48:35.140]  But every media network sells products the difference is when the big media is doing it when corporate media is doing it
[3:48:35.380 --> 3:48:39.460]  They're shilling for products. They have no idea whether they're any good at all
[3:48:39.460 --> 3:48:42.100]  They have invented them they can't vouch for them
[3:48:42.340 --> 3:48:46.660]  They don't know whether it helps the people that buy them or hurts the people that buy them
[3:48:46.900 --> 3:48:50.260]  That's the big difference between info wars and big media
[3:48:50.660 --> 3:48:57.940]  Info wars doesn't promote any product. It doesn't believe in it doesn't support anything for its consumers that won't make its consumers
[3:48:58.260 --> 3:49:04.980]  Healthier wealthier better off. That's the difference. So that's how you can go to info wars store dot com today
[3:49:04.980 --> 3:49:11.460]  And find something that will make your your life better make you healthier wealthier and wiser
[3:49:11.860 --> 3:49:17.140]  While you're supporting the important community and network of info wars, you're also supporting yourself
[3:49:17.540 --> 3:49:23.700]  By supporting alternative independent health. There's a reason why the district of columbia is doing what they're doing and
[3:49:23.940 --> 3:49:30.420]  Allowing homeopathic medicines to be attacked now in court is somehow fraud because it doesn't have the FDA's approval
[3:49:30.420 --> 3:49:35.380]  It's important to remember the food and drug administration much like the u.s. Department of Agriculture
[3:49:35.780 --> 3:49:45.220]  Originated as marketing agencies not as medical agencies not as health agencies not as food regulation agencies
[3:49:45.380 --> 3:49:51.540]  In fact, what they're there for was to say that the food is what it says it is that the food was made in a particular manner
[3:49:51.860 --> 3:49:55.380]  To have accuracy and advertising for the benefit of consumers
[3:49:55.380 --> 3:50:02.820]  That who is who all these laws were for the FDA was not supposed to take over the state's prerogative and governing medicine
[3:50:03.220 --> 3:50:09.940]  The usda was not supposed to take over the state's prerogative and governing food and governing farms
[3:50:10.260 --> 3:50:13.540]  This was supposed to be decisions you yourself made in your own home
[3:50:13.860 --> 3:50:17.060]  Yet in the amos miller case you have the u.s. Department of Agriculture
[3:50:17.380 --> 3:50:24.020]  Wanting the judge to dictate to amos miller what food he can make and label for his own children for private use
[3:50:24.020 --> 3:50:30.340]  Imagine that imagine if they take over to the degree that you can't even grill food the way you want to
[3:50:30.580 --> 3:50:32.980]  You can't even have a barbecue the way you want to
[3:50:33.380 --> 3:50:38.340]  There are other ways you can also support info wars directly if you want to support the effort to
[3:50:38.820 --> 3:50:41.940]  Compensate the various legal expenses that info wars currently
[3:50:42.660 --> 3:50:45.940]  Experiencing both in these law fair cases and in the bankruptcy case
[3:50:46.420 --> 3:50:51.860]  And that is at save info wars com pretty simple name pretty straightforward pretty easy
[3:50:51.860 --> 3:50:53.860]  You can share the link with others
[3:50:54.500 --> 3:51:01.300]  To continue to show that it isn't just the left that can manage to raise money to defend themselves in the court of law
[3:51:01.540 --> 3:51:07.700]  The left for a while has been able to do so with ease you had high ranking corrupt fbi agents raise
[3:51:09.140 --> 3:51:11.140]  $650,000 in 24 hours
[3:51:11.700 --> 3:51:17.300]  What does that message send that sends the message that if you're on the left you will have full legal protection because the
[3:51:18.180 --> 3:51:20.180]  There will be a rallying
[3:51:20.180 --> 3:51:27.220]  Effect of people to pour in the means of providing for their legal defense. It is a politically potent tool
[3:51:27.780 --> 3:51:34.500]  Their save info wars.com is our answer to that to show that this can be done for people that are important
[3:51:34.900 --> 3:51:42.180]  Not just to the institutional left not just to corrupt deep state actors like some of the fbi folks that raise that kind of
[3:51:42.260 --> 3:51:43.220]  cash
[3:51:43.220 --> 3:51:50.500]  In the same capacity if you want something like the very cool coins that are at 1776 coin dot com
[3:51:50.900 --> 3:51:55.540]  It is a way to have a personal momento a personal heritage of quality value
[3:51:55.940 --> 3:52:00.980]  So that you can support info wars and have something that you like and enjoy in your own home
[3:52:01.300 --> 3:52:09.780]  And it has certain intrinsic value that may increase in time and probably should so whether it's 1776 coin dot com
[3:52:09.780 --> 3:52:13.700]  Save info wars dot com or info wars store dot com
[3:52:14.020 --> 3:52:19.220]  There are multiple and myriad means whereby you can continue to keep info wars on the on the air
[3:52:19.460 --> 3:52:25.780]  Continue to make this self sustaining experiment in media democracy alive in the american
[3:52:26.740 --> 3:52:31.860]  Revolution's tradition and the best of that tradition and fight back against these show trials
[3:52:32.180 --> 3:52:38.980]  Designed to eviscerate our core constitutional rights and liberties in america so that everybody is supposed to have their day in court
[3:52:38.980 --> 3:52:44.420]  They don't want alex jones to have his day in court because they don't want you to have your day in the court
[3:52:44.900 --> 3:52:47.860]  When it becomes politically convenient to them over time
[3:52:48.500 --> 3:52:55.460]  So was putin right well when we look at how our behavior of the u.s. Department of Agriculture the food and drug administration
[3:52:55.780 --> 3:53:00.500]  The coerced vaccines the lockdowns the various dumb foreign wars
[3:53:00.500 --> 3:53:05.860]  We've seen waged in another one with the support of billions and billions of dollars in ukraine
[3:53:05.860 --> 3:53:11.300]  Pouring in for no useful purpose other than the dead lives of many young ukrainian men
[3:53:11.940 --> 3:53:18.020]  Conscripted into the conflict in a needless battle that only occurred because of the made on coup of 2014
[3:53:18.580 --> 3:53:24.420]  Sponsored and subsidized and supported by the obama administration and by john mccain and lindsay gramp
[3:53:25.060 --> 3:53:28.580]  So and there's no question that as it relates to ukraine
[3:53:28.580 --> 3:53:31.140]  There's a lot of evidence to support putin's hypothesis
[3:53:31.140 --> 3:53:38.020]  That western elites simply look at the world as a place to exploit and conquer for their own personal profit at the expense
[3:53:38.020 --> 3:53:42.340]  As he pointed out of their own domestic civilizations and population
[3:53:42.900 --> 3:53:46.020]  He also pointed out that there's a context for the wokeness
[3:53:46.900 --> 3:53:50.180]  Revolution taking place and his point was that this was an attack
[3:53:51.220 --> 3:53:56.820]  on the tradition the family on the community on cultures that provide any kind of
[3:53:56.820 --> 3:54:04.500]  Independent from their control that it's about their control and then if people support traditional family values if people don't support
[3:54:05.220 --> 3:54:10.340]  Mutilating young children because they're momentarily confused about which gender they are
[3:54:10.740 --> 3:54:16.260]  Thanks to the corruption of american educational institutions and the co-option of american medicine by these
[3:54:16.900 --> 3:54:18.900]  corrupt ideologies and idolatries
[3:54:19.700 --> 3:54:21.380]  In that context
[3:54:21.380 --> 3:54:27.220]  Why are they encouraging such behavior from putin's hypothesis and thesis presented at his speech last week
[3:54:27.700 --> 3:54:31.540]  The reason is that they need to call and quash
[3:54:31.940 --> 3:54:38.420]  All dissident movements of any kind and the thing that gives it their independence the thing that gives it its their rootedness
[3:54:38.900 --> 3:54:41.860]  Is their tradition is their culture is their
[3:54:42.660 --> 3:54:50.740]  Traditional religion is their traditional morality is their traditional understanding of gender is their traditional understanding of family
[3:54:50.740 --> 3:54:53.540]  Is their traditional understanding of marriage?
[3:54:54.100 --> 3:55:00.740]  And it is the attack on those institutions that is part and parcel of this elite driven goal to eviscerate
[3:55:01.060 --> 3:55:03.300]  Anything they see standing in their way
[3:55:03.700 --> 3:55:10.340]  The best way to think of it is the same kind of mindset not just a popular front mindset of the 1920s 1930s
[3:55:10.420 --> 3:55:18.660]  Communism which was to march like gromshee style through all the institutions to co-opt those institutions and weaponize everything
[3:55:18.660 --> 3:55:23.060]  In other words, if you're a human resources department at a mid-level corporation
[3:55:23.300 --> 3:55:28.900]  Weaponize it for politicized purposes if you're a librarian deciding what books go in and kids get to see
[3:55:29.380 --> 3:55:34.580]  Weaponize it for politicized purposes if you are a vendor or contractor or bank
[3:55:35.060 --> 3:55:42.260]  Weaponize access to capital or credit or contracts based on political purposes. They want to weaponize everything
[3:55:42.580 --> 3:55:45.780]  Not just the law in order to eviscerate any independence
[3:55:45.780 --> 3:55:51.540]  A movement that could occur any dissident movement that could occur any resistance movement that could occur
[3:55:51.940 --> 3:55:54.980]  And that is part and parcel of the culture war as well
[3:55:55.380 --> 3:55:57.380]  The effort to use their monopolization
[3:55:57.780 --> 3:56:04.580]  de facto monopolization of hollywood and our cultural institutions our academy and our schools in order to basically
[3:56:04.980 --> 3:56:09.380]  Co-opt the minds of our own youth using everything from tick tock to
[3:56:09.780 --> 3:56:10.980]  Netflix to
[3:56:10.980 --> 3:56:16.100]  What's taking place in the classroom to what's available at the local library with things like
[3:56:16.580 --> 3:56:19.620]  Normalizing drag shows and strip shows for little kids
[3:56:20.100 --> 3:56:25.060]  This mindset as putin presented is part of an attempt to eviscerate any form of resistance
[3:56:25.380 --> 3:56:32.500]  Because they know in traditional beliefs traditional cultures traditional understanding of family and marriage and personal relationships
[3:56:32.740 --> 3:56:39.620]  In almost every traditional religion in the world. They do not go along with these efforts to eviscerate a sense of gender identity
[3:56:39.620 --> 3:56:42.580]  They do not go along with sexualizing little children
[3:56:42.820 --> 3:56:44.660]  They do not go along with
[3:56:44.660 --> 3:56:51.220]  Emasculating them in their irreversible medical treatments that could prevent them from ever having their own children again or a normal life ever again
[3:56:51.460 --> 3:56:53.620]  As more and more have stepped forward and complained about
[3:56:54.020 --> 3:57:01.140]  Putin correctly put this in the context of the western elites who have no sense of deep moral values
[3:57:01.300 --> 3:57:08.900]  Who simply want to exploit the world and see our traditions our cultures our past our history as a threat to their power
[3:57:08.900 --> 3:57:10.500]  To their control
[3:57:10.500 --> 3:57:17.300]  So whether it's the case of amos miller standing up against the u.s. Department of Agriculture as a sole individual amish farmer
[3:57:17.620 --> 3:57:20.740]  Trying to respect his community of faith and his community of consumers
[3:57:21.060 --> 3:57:24.500]  Whether it's alex jones standing up against show trials or whether it's you
[3:57:24.980 --> 3:57:30.500]  Supporting networks like info wars by going to places like info war store.com. That's the resistance
[3:57:30.580 --> 3:57:33.780]  They want to quash and they can't as long as you stand up
[3:57:33.780 --> 3:57:40.580]  So remember as long as you hold the line and you're the front of the line. They can never be successful
[3:57:47.140 --> 3:57:51.300]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist
[3:57:52.020 --> 3:57:54.020]  I have come from nowhere
[3:57:54.500 --> 3:57:57.780]  To the very heights of politics not just in america for the world
[3:57:57.780 --> 3:58:04.820]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit
[3:58:05.300 --> 3:58:11.780]  Yes, I've persevered but the listeners and viewers who support them for wars for the real reason you've had the success
[3:58:12.500 --> 3:58:17.380]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had
[3:58:17.940 --> 3:58:23.700]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today
[3:58:23.700 --> 3:58:29.860]  It's more important than ever realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue and the efforts you've been carrying out
