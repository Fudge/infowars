[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.439]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:17.280]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:17.532]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:18.232]  Today.
[00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:52.081]   Well, I can't say that I personally enjoy the entire establishment trying to bring us down, but deep down it is satisfying to know that we're really given these corrupt globalists A run for their money, and that they fear us, above all others, for igniting brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere, as Thomas Jefferson talked about, the author of our Declaration of Independence.
[00:00:53.902 --> 00:01:08.414]  Well, this is a Saturday evening emergency special with my good friend and well-known constitutional lawyer, Robert Barnes, who's been here for two weeks covering the show, Trial of the Century, and they got two more coming up.
[00:01:08.674 --> 00:01:09.134]  Wow.
[00:01:10.155 --> 00:01:11.736]  To break it all down is just insane.
[00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.218]  We're going to do it here today because people have a lot of questions.
[00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:19.723]  It's been the number one story for the last week in the United States.
[00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:23.146]  It's been in the top 10 stories in Europe and other parts of the world.
[00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:37.832]  Not China threatening war, not Russia winning the Ukraine war, not collapsing borders, not human smuggling, not mass suicides and fentanyl deaths, but the monster Alex Jones who questioned a mass shooting.
[00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:47.277]  And then I have the mayor of Uvalde in my stack actually coming out and saying he thinks there's a cover-up in Uvalde.
[00:01:47.317 --> 00:01:51.899]  Well, I guess he'll be the next person to face a 40-plus million dollar judgment.
[00:01:53.018 --> 00:02:02.083]  You're about to get the exclusive details of what really happened in the show trial, what it means next, what these huge judgments mean, is M4 going to be closing, is it going to be shutting down?
[00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:09.066]  We're going to talk about it all here in the next hour with Robert Barnes and play some of these incredible clips.
[00:02:10.247 --> 00:02:12.308]  The ambulance chasing lawyers.
[00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:19.384]  of the Democratic Party openly bragged in their closing statements, take his megaphone away and everybody else like him.
[00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:22.065]  We have to shut them down and silence this information.
[00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.526]  The judge said she is the arbiter of truth, not me.
[00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.227]  She said, I'm a liar.
[00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:28.207]  My lawyer's a liar.
[00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:29.308]  Everybody's a liar.
[00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:39.211]  This is an incredible time to be alive and to lay out how this show trial of the century that would make the Nazis blush is Robert Barnes.
[00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:40.752]  Robert, simply incredible.
[00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:41.532]  No doubt.
[00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:45.836]  I mean, basically, even the Soviets tried to make a show trial at least a good show.
[00:02:46.016 --> 00:02:51.261]  This was a show trial that was so one-sided, so evidently partisan, so made-for-the-movie scripts.
[00:02:51.741 --> 00:03:00.169]  I was talking to Mark Rober the other day, and this is a Hollywood screenwriter, and even he was shocked to hear how it was basically designed, the courtroom was designed like a set.
[00:03:00.508 --> 00:03:06.347]   with three big movie cameras with the judge alternating the what could be said and when it could be said
[00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:10.468]   and how it could be said and who could say it in such a way that had nothing to do
[00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:13.427]   with the rules of evidence, nothing to do with the rules of law in Texas,
[00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:18.988]   nothing to do with constitutional liberties and protection, and everything to do with scripting a case
[00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:23.508]   so that it would have a particular outcome and in particular a future media narrative
[00:03:23.508 --> 00:03:29.908]   that could be spun, and ultimately an actual future movie where the judge has made herself the star.
[00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:34.788]   That is what has happened in this case, and it is a show trial unparalleled and unprecedented
[00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.508]  in American or world history.
[00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:40.748]   There have been analogous examples, but nothing as severe, nothing as substantial,
[00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:47.388]   and nothing as literally scripted for a movie as this film, as this case was.
[00:03:47.388 --> 00:03:52.587]   And again, whether we're right or wrong about things, that's up to the public to decide.
[00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:58.403]  When they try to censor and control outlets, they're trying to censor what you can see, what you can watch, and literally mind-control you.
[00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:00.644]  Since I mentioned it, here's Axios.
[00:04:00.664 --> 00:04:01.985]  Do they deserve to be sued in oblivion?
[00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:06.048]  The Evalde mayor says he fears cover-up of deadly school shooting.
[00:04:06.508 --> 00:04:10.451]  The same thing that the head of the state police is saying they've been lied to.
[00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:12.709]  This is incredible.
[00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:21.959]  Robert Barnes continuing with your observations, both watching the trial on TV, being down there, having live coverage of it, why you say it's the most insane show trial ever.
[00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:26.027]  It is because, well first of all, there pretty much wasn't a right that the judge didn't violate.
[00:04:26.207 --> 00:04:29.870]  First Amendment right of freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of the press.
[00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:33.814]  Second Amendment right to speak out in favor of the Second Amendment right to self-defense.
[00:04:34.154 --> 00:04:35.476]  Fourth Amendment right to privacy.
[00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:37.938]  She violated that repeatedly throughout the proceedings.
[00:04:38.218 --> 00:04:50.110]   Not only what went on in the discovery being unduly invasive, but in fact turning over and telling the plaintiff's lawyer he could turn over attorney-client privilege communications Protected by the Fourth Amendment to the January 6th Committee or whomever else.
[00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:58.439]  Fifth Amendment rights to due process of law, denied rights to bring motions to dismiss, anti-slap motions, denied right to bring appeals, summary judgment motions.
[00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:06.127]  Sixth Amendment rights to both counsel and confrontation, infringed by the attorney-client privilege being disclosed, and the right to confront those making accusations against you.
[00:05:06.867 --> 00:05:08.529]  7th Amendment right to trial by jury.
[00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.754]  And that means a right to trial by jury on all facts, not just the facts the judge decides can be tried.
[00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:20.720]  And that all of those same analogous federal constitutional provisions have analogs in the state constitution of the state of Texas.
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:27.607]  Well that's right, her quote was when Bankston said he's going to give what they call the contents of my phone, it's not, to the January 6th committee.
[00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:32.470]  He said, I will not stand between you and Congress.
[00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.470]  Well, the state's supposed to stand up for our rights.
[00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:35.130]  Exactly.
[00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:43.792]  I mean, it's only because of a judge's order that that information is in the possession at all of the plaintiff's counsel, who basically stole it under the law.
[00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:44.712]  That's what he did.
[00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:50.534]  He got information he knew he wasn't entitled to, admitted that openly in court, and yet was allowed to be rewarded for it.
[00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:51.534]  But that wasn't all.
[00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:57.358]  Then you go to Texas substantive law that was routinely and flagrantly violated at every stage of these proceedings.
[00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:03.682]  This includes the right to summary judgment for claims that are brought under these terms that don't have a legal basis.
[00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:05.983]  The right of statutes of limitations.
[00:06:06.103 --> 00:06:08.825]  These claims are mostly all past the statute of limitations.
[00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:12.047]  The right to bring an appeal of a summary judgment motion.
[00:06:12.307 --> 00:06:19.210]   The right under defamation law to challenge Whether or not an apology, correction, or retraction was given, and to mitigate damages.
[00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:30.512]  The right to demand that a punitive damages request be done in a timely manner, which didn't happen here, based on their own testimony of the plaintiffs in court, and what the plaintiffs' lawyers said and admitted in court.
[00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:37.973]  The attempts to get an inflated punitive damages verdict, that is in excess of what Texas statutes allow, or what constitutional due process permits.
[00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:42.994]  And then, after that, violation of pretty much every rule of evidence you can possibly imagine.
[00:06:43.314 --> 00:06:58.764]  The Rule of Evidence Concerning Relevance, The Rule of Evidence Concerning Materiality, The Rules of Evidence Concerning Completeness, The Rules of Evidence Concerning Hearsay, The Rules of Evidence... And for folks that don't know, they wouldn't let us have any of our videos in, even though they were in evidence, and turned over to them and their evidence.
[00:06:58.824 --> 00:07:01.326]  But then she would not let us play videos when we wanted to.
[00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:08.150]  They would play five second clips from my show last week, out of context, and I would say, may I please see the larger clip?
[00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.211]  No.
[00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:14.097]  It just went on and on and now they want to sanction my lawyer and Dino Reynaud.
[00:07:14.437 --> 00:07:18.160]  I mean, it's an attempt to punish everybody who defended you in any way, shape or form.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:24.244]  There's been constant attacks in the court of public opinion and in the courts of law against anyone who defended Alex Jones or Infowars.
[00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:32.509]   And let's be clear, if I was caught with dead kids in my basement, the defense lawyer that took the job, they'd call him a hero because every man deserves A defense.
[00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:36.290]  But now with Alex Jones, who just questioned a mass shooting, oh no.
[00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:37.511]  We've got a sanction.
[00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.511]  Every lawyer involved.
[00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:39.091]  Absolutely.
[00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:41.992]  Not only that, they excluded your lawyer of choice repeatedly.
[00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:44.133]  They tried to kick me out of the case early on.
[00:07:44.173 --> 00:07:47.494]  They did exclude multiple other lawyers who you had retained to appear.
[00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:49.234]  They didn't allow them to appear in Texas.
[00:07:49.274 --> 00:07:50.815]  Didn't allow them to appear in Connecticut.
[00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:53.716]  So they controlled which lawyer was representing you.
[00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:56.118]  They controlled how the jury selection went forward.
[00:07:56.358 --> 00:08:01.000]  They're not supposed to be allowed to ask, hey, do you commit to a ridiculous verdict before you even sit down?
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:11.906]  Yet that's what happened here, and the only jurors that were allowed to participate were the ones that thought there was never been any media bias against Alex Jones or InfoWars ever, and had committed to a $100 million verdict before they were even seated.
[00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:15.548]  So you had violations at every single level of the process.
[00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:19.910]  We had a graduate student get up there, and we're going to walk through all of it because this is historic.
[00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.411]  And you did a great job laying out just some of what they did.
[00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:25.230]   people are experts who aren't qualified to speak in the subject matter.
[00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:29.871]   They had a graduate student get up there and we're gonna walk through all of it because
[00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:30.870]  this is historic.
[00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.629]   And you did a great job laying out just some of what they did.
[00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:37.870]   You'll have more time, but we should answer the big question up front.
[00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.591]  This is the first thing I should have gotten to.
[00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.950]   Obviously the $40-something million judgment on punitives, the previous judgment, and then
[00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:50.350]   clips of the plaintiff's lawyers literally admitting they want to silence me and take
[00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.510]   me off the air and use us as the precedent for everybody else.
[00:08:54.698 --> 00:08:59.840]  Now obviously we said that was the plan, but they admitted it during their statements in court.
[00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:07.978]  During their closing arguments and in press conferences, we have those clips coming up, but this is incredible coordination.
[00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:16.195]  The law and is this really a 40 plus million dollar judgment or what's really happening?
[00:09:16.435 --> 00:09:17.536]  So two different things there.
[00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:21.219]  One, the plaintiff's counsel continues to lie to the press and the public.
[00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:29.084]  Two days ago he said that you could get a punitive damages award and the only limit was due process and whether it was 10x the ratio of damages.
[00:09:29.424 --> 00:09:30.125]  That's the U.S.
[00:09:30.145 --> 00:09:33.347]  Supreme Court that has nothing, by the way it's 6x, not 10x.
[00:09:34.568 --> 00:09:37.549]  Is the historical definition under the BMW case by the U.S.
[00:09:37.569 --> 00:09:38.129]  Supreme Court.
[00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:39.489]  So he misstated even what the U.S.
[00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:40.210]  Supreme Court said.
[00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.191]  But Texas law has always limited what punitive damages are allowed.
[00:09:44.591 --> 00:09:53.753]  And he lied again yesterday after the verdict trying to let people believe there's these false claims out there that they can enforce part of the $45 million or $13 million or $32 million.
[00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:54.093]  All false.
[00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:58.795]  The Texas law is completely clear.
[00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:03.097]  It's $750,000 per defendant cap total period.
[00:10:03.437 --> 00:10:12.180]  So basically what these verdicts end up being is something like $3.6, $3.7 million for each plaintiff.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.040]  And that's it.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.161]  And so the idea that it can... Oh, actually, $2.8 million per plaintiff.
[00:10:17.782 --> 00:10:22.285]  So you're talking about $5.7 million collectively between both defendants.
[00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:22.945]  That's all.
[00:10:23.045 --> 00:10:24.746]  It's not a $50 million verdict.
[00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:34.871]  The reason why the judge didn't honor that and respect that right out of the gate is because she wanted the fake news narrative to go around the globe to say, see, this is the death of Alex Jones.
[00:10:35.132 --> 00:10:36.532]  This is the end of Alex Jones.
[00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:39.214]  This is a judgment that nobody could possibly repay.
[00:10:39.634 --> 00:10:40.375]  That's what they wanted.
[00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:49.641]  They wanted the headline, but the headline is a lie about the law, and that's why the plaintiff's lawyer, Mark Bankston, went out and lied to the press about what Texas law represents.
[00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:59.408]  Texas law limits this to $750,000 per plaintiff, per defendant, and that puts a cap and reduces almost all of the punitive damages verdict.
[00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:02.389]  To a small percentage of what the jury issued.
[00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:05.770]  What was more terrifying from my perspective is what you bring up.
[00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:13.353]  They overtly, openly, and explicitly called for the execution of Alex Jones financially in the closing arguments.
[00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:25.358]  That what they've been hiding and lying about, saying, oh this case is just about Sandy Hook, this case is just about some parents, this case really had nothing to do with either, just look at their punitive damages arguments.
[00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:37.768]  See how much in their punitive damages arguments they're talking about Sandy Hook and parents, and how much they're talking about kill Alex Jones, kill Infowars, don't let him ever come back again, don't let him ever be on a platform again.
[00:11:37.809 --> 00:11:38.449]  Those are quotes.
[00:11:38.649 --> 00:11:40.131]  Why would they be so brazen?
[00:11:40.811 --> 00:11:53.702]  Because I think they had a political jury that they knew that the facts of the case were not persuasive enough to even a liberal democratic jury to issue a big verdict, even though this was mostly a phyrrhic symbolic verdict.
[00:11:54.082 --> 00:12:05.671]  They needed to appeal to the political prejudices of the jury, an overwhelmingly liberal democratic jury, and say, this is your chance to censor and suppress Alex Jones forever.
[00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:11.876]   Remember one of the jurors during the jury trial said, Can we use this case to go after election deniers too?
[00:12:12.457 --> 00:12:13.978]  That's what they were appealing to.
[00:12:14.038 --> 00:12:18.401]  They had heard those same questions and they said, OK, yeah, maybe our case is kind of crap.
[00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:19.302]  Ignore that.
[00:12:19.582 --> 00:12:21.723]  This is your chance to remove Alex Jones from the game.
[00:12:21.743 --> 00:12:21.983]  That's right.
[00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:22.464]  Let's be clear.
[00:12:22.584 --> 00:12:25.146]  Never said these people's names until the trial.
[00:12:25.806 --> 00:12:26.206]  Absolutely.
[00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:30.269]  I mean, and by the way, that's called the constitutional requirement of colloquium.
[00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:33.010]  New York Times versus Sullivan established this.
[00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:44.237]  Not just the actual malice standard, which they also got rid of in your case, but also the requirement that you make a specific factual claim about a specifically identified individual.
[00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:50.518]   Well, a lot of top lawyers, I've got their quotes here in a stack of articles, are saying You can't just have the Alex Jones exception.
[00:12:50.538 --> 00:12:51.839]  This is going to spread to everybody.
[00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:55.541]  This is going to cause talk show hosts, you name it, insurance to go way up.
[00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.782]  I mean, this is a real attempt to get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:12:58.122 --> 00:13:08.969]  If the same standard was applied to Axios that was applied to you, they could be sued into bankruptcy tomorrow by running a headline that says the mayor of Uvalde questions whether or not there's a school shooting cover-up.
[00:13:09.309 --> 00:13:13.773]  Because to be clear, they didn't limit this case to just one or two specific statements.
[00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:21.881]  They said any statement questioning anything concerning the Sandy Hook official narrative warranted a death penalty.
[00:13:21.921 --> 00:13:29.809]  They gave you a death penalty sanction in the default judgment stage, then gave you another, and they asked for a death penalty sanction from the jury in the punitive damages stage.
[00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.932]  A punitive damages state where you were not allowed to present any evidence.
[00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.533]  You were barred and gagged.
[00:13:34.573 --> 00:13:38.357]  I mean, I told people the closest analogy to this case is the Chicago 7 case.
[00:13:38.657 --> 00:13:41.380]  And even they got to say at least a little bit in their own defense.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.322]  I mean, they got more of a defense than you did.
[00:13:43.842 --> 00:13:44.643]  And it's the same pattern.
[00:13:44.683 --> 00:13:45.864]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[00:13:45.904 --> 00:13:47.426]  So people ask me, how are you handling it?
[00:13:48.207 --> 00:13:50.649]  These are some of the big questions people have before we get these video clips.
[00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:51.210]  I'll answer them.
[00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:55.222]  I'm worried about America and my children's future and your children's future.
[00:13:55.783 --> 00:13:58.184]  I know I don't have $2 million in cash sitting around.
[00:13:58.824 --> 00:14:00.104]  I know that we're maxed out.
[00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:02.345]  I'm not about making money.
[00:14:02.365 --> 00:14:05.147]  I'm about fighting the New World Order, but it takes money to do that.
[00:14:05.927 --> 00:14:10.289]  And so I even have crew members ask, are we still going to be on air?
[00:14:10.969 --> 00:14:12.610]  What does it mean that we've declared bankruptcy?
[00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:21.830]  We've declared bankruptcy to put our cards on the table and show there's not all this money, and we can't fight these other show trials and do all of this, and we're on the verge of insolvency.
[00:14:22.371 --> 00:14:38.884]   But yes, InfoWars is continuing on with The War Room, with American Journal, with myself, with Greg Reese, and all the other great producers, from Darren McBreen to John Bound to everybody and the millions of people a day
[00:14:38.884 --> 00:14:39.533]  that we reach.
[00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:41.933]  But that's really up to the listeners and viewers.
[00:14:41.933 --> 00:14:45.693]   If you're asking, if we're going to continue on, we can go for years and years and years
[00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:50.413]   in bankruptcy and appealing these cases and fighting for sure.
[00:14:50.413 --> 00:14:56.014]   But only if you go to m4workstore.com and buy the great products they continue to support.
[00:14:56.304 --> 00:15:09.008]  But the globalists see us as a major light on the hill or a beacon, a lighthouse that they don't want out there for the rest of the people in the nation and in the world.
[00:15:09.068 --> 00:15:11.168]  They know we're having a big effect.
[00:15:11.228 --> 00:15:13.449]  They know we're exposing the Great Reset.
[00:15:13.489 --> 00:15:17.604]   They know that if they can shut us down and demonize us,
[00:15:17.604 --> 00:15:19.204]  they can intimidate everybody else.
[00:15:19.204 --> 00:15:27.765]   So that's why InfoWars is a major rallying point right now for free speech and our message of exposing
[00:15:27.765 --> 00:15:29.525]  the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:32.804]  And that's why your support is absolutely critical.
[00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:35.525]  Yes, we're gonna continue on.
[00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:40.324]   If we get your support, if you spread the word, if you share the articles, if you tell people,
[00:15:40.324 --> 00:15:42.885]  Alex Jones is live, they don't want you to hear it.
[00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:44.720]  InfoWars.com, 11 a.m.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.181]  weekdays.
[00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:47.002]  If you do that, we will win.
[00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:49.323]  The people are hungry for the truth right now.
[00:15:49.523 --> 00:15:54.846]  Now, since we mentioned this, I want to play a few clips here because I don't want to just say this like the media does.
[00:15:55.206 --> 00:15:56.547]  They'll say something that won't show proof.
[00:15:57.387 --> 00:16:12.145]   I want to Actually show you some clips of the lawyers in front of the jury, who'd already been told I was guilty more than 20 times by the judge, unprecedented, saying it's about silencing Alex Jones.
[00:16:12.165 --> 00:16:13.386]  These are just some of the quotes.
[00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:14.986]  Take his megaphone away.
[00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:16.207]  He's patient zero.
[00:16:16.247 --> 00:16:16.787]  Get rid of him.
[00:16:17.207 --> 00:16:29.636]   And then Bankston, one of the ambulance chasers, outside, Telling the press about their big master plan to cut up the corpse and share the corpse.
[00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:30.176]  It's a quote.
[00:16:31.057 --> 00:16:33.179]  Divide up the corpse.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.140]  Quote.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.223]  But first, let's hit this because people want to know about this.
[00:16:39.526 --> 00:16:39.746]  Robert.
[00:16:41.678 --> 00:16:42.980]  What needs to come out of this?
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:56.197]  How do we, the people, how does Congress, how do the governors, how do the legislatures, how do we counter the total weaponization of the judiciary and what they admit is this pilot project with us?
[00:16:57.213 --> 00:17:00.555]  To use this against everyone, which they've now admitted they're planning.
[00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:02.036]  There needs to be a parallel approach.
[00:17:02.196 --> 00:17:08.379]  One is continuing to fight in the court of public opinion, because more and more people need to hear about this, know about this, and understand the outrage of it.
[00:17:08.719 --> 00:17:11.221]  For example, like Tim Pool yesterday had a discussion on it.
[00:17:11.401 --> 00:17:14.303]  Frankly, it was a very under-informed conversation.
[00:17:15.043 --> 00:17:20.526]  People like that need to have a much more informed conversation about what this case is really about.
[00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:26.709]  I like Tim Pool, and I only saw a clip of it, but I saw a statement about how he hated everybody in the trial, and it was just horrible.
[00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.571]  So let's, I like Tim, but let's call out what you saw.
[00:17:30.812 --> 00:17:37.115]  Yeah, so I mean, he had people on that, honestly, some of them had just read the media, and they had not actually looked at what happened in the case.
[00:17:37.455 --> 00:17:39.857]  And this is, I've run into this repeatedly.
[00:17:40.257 --> 00:17:42.138]  As I've said, you look at people who have looked at this.
[00:17:42.778 --> 00:17:46.922]  Mike Cernovich, Jack Posobiec, Charlie Kirk, and others called it out yesterday.
[00:17:47.302 --> 00:17:58.091]  The people that have studied this case, Michael Malice, others, myself, Viva Frye, and others in the legal community that have looked at this case understand how dangerous and what an outrage it is.
[00:17:58.431 --> 00:18:04.016]  That it is a case that poses an imminent risk, a perilous risk, to core First Amendment freedoms for everybody.
[00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:06.498]  And they say they're using it to take over and take speech.
[00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:06.958]  Exactly.
[00:18:06.978 --> 00:18:08.260]  They say it's a blueprint.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:18.611]  Any illusions about what this case is about are gone based on the closing statements and punitive damages stage of the case made by the plaintiff's lawyers and made by them in the press and made by other members of the press.
[00:18:18.851 --> 00:18:23.396]  You can read press articles today saying this will be the template to take out everybody we don't like.
[00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:25.659]  This was an arrogant declaration of war.
[00:18:25.959 --> 00:18:26.419]  Completely.
[00:18:26.459 --> 00:18:51.430]  I mean, the most historical analogous circumstance was in the late 1950s and early 1960s, which led to the New York Times vs. Sullivan, but only because there had been so much public outrage around the country about what was happening, was Southern corrupt sheriffs and Klan-oriented policemen were suing dissidents and press and independents and civil rights participants and protesters into bankruptcy and oblivion.
[00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.172]  That's what New York Times vs. Sullivan was really about.
[00:18:54.352 --> 00:18:55.132]  Crazy verdict.
[00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:57.894]  Similar to what took place here on the punitive damages side.
[00:18:58.274 --> 00:19:01.316]  And their goal and objective was to intimidate, terrorize.
[00:19:01.517 --> 00:19:09.182]  This is why it's so important people continue to support InfoWars, because InfoWars can continue to pay its monthly bills as long as InfoWars continues to get support.
[00:19:09.442 --> 00:19:11.263]  That money is not getting diverted to anywhere else.
[00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:14.745]  That money is going for operational, ongoing basis.
[00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:17.367]  Everybody is watching what's going to happen.
[00:19:17.707 --> 00:19:20.169]  Everybody is watching, will InfoWars be off the air?
[00:19:20.249 --> 00:19:22.991]   Because that's what the plaintiff's lawyers were That's what they were predicting yesterday.
[00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:29.733]  They were going to chop up Alex Jones and distribute him for all of their cannibalistic political patrons to consume.
[00:19:30.113 --> 00:19:32.514]  And they, that's what their audience is expecting.
[00:19:32.534 --> 00:19:34.835]  They literally, like I'm a suckling pig at dinner.
[00:19:35.095 --> 00:19:35.836]  That's exactly right.
[00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:36.676]  That's what it is.
[00:19:36.736 --> 00:19:38.457]  I mean, they got the spoke ready to roll.
[00:19:38.857 --> 00:19:44.199]  And so the, when people don't see that, when people see the, because this has really always been a war on the audience.
[00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:46.720]  We were supposed to be off the air four years ago.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.460]  Absolutely.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.281]  They've gone attack, after attack, after attack, after attack.
[00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:52.681]  And this one is supposed to be the death kill.
[00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:57.602]  This one is supposed to be the end of InfoWars, and in particular, the end of InfoWars audience.
[00:19:57.942 --> 00:20:00.562]  The audience's ability to... Yeah, you're the ones they hate.
[00:20:01.163 --> 00:20:02.823]  They know we're just a focal point, exactly.
[00:20:02.843 --> 00:20:06.503]  And I promise you, my friends, we're not going anywhere unless you don't support.
[00:20:06.984 --> 00:20:08.204]  It's not the bankruptcy.
[00:20:08.264 --> 00:20:09.524]  It's not the plaintiff's lawyers.
[00:20:10.084 --> 00:20:10.864]  None of that matters.
[00:20:11.404 --> 00:20:14.685]  We have got a lot of big stuff going on, like the film, the book.
[00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:15.665]  Absolutely.
[00:20:15.484 --> 00:20:19.623]   bigger stuff and we're gonna as John Paul Jones said the founder of the US
[00:20:19.623 --> 00:20:23.203]   Navy I've only begun to fight the British said you ready to surrender he
[00:20:23.203 --> 00:20:26.403]   said no I've only begun to fight and then his ship one-third the size of
[00:20:26.403 --> 00:20:29.964]   theirs took the ship we have only begun to fight this is when the real
[00:20:29.964 --> 00:20:34.043]   intensity starts oh absolutely and as long as people continue to hold the line
[00:20:34.043 --> 00:20:37.523]   you know the they are the front of the line and as long as they hold the line
[00:20:37.523 --> 00:20:41.163]   they will not be able to break in for wars they will not be able to destroy
[00:20:41.163 --> 00:20:47.323]   Alex Jones because Alex Jones is everybody and everybody is Alex Jones.
[00:20:45.012 --> 00:20:46.733]  This is about the voice of the people.
[00:20:47.073 --> 00:20:48.374]  That's the voice they want to silence.
[00:20:48.394 --> 00:20:48.634]  That's right.
[00:20:48.654 --> 00:20:49.454]  They're coming for everybody.
[00:20:49.494 --> 00:20:51.555]  The listeners know and we're getting a lot of support and it's great.
[00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:53.616]  So let me raise this before we play these clips.
[00:20:56.097 --> 00:21:00.559]  They had this so-called economist up who said he assessed the Koch brothers.
[00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.820]  He didn't work for the Koch brothers.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.260]  We looked it up.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.261]  He did an assessment of them from afar.
[00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:06.142]  He read newspaper headlines.
[00:21:06.162 --> 00:21:08.403]  So I couldn't have my list of notes.
[00:21:09.394 --> 00:21:14.097]  For questions, but he could have a stack of notes and say, well, this is why we know Jones does this.
[00:21:14.617 --> 00:21:15.638]  The New York Times says so.
[00:21:16.198 --> 00:21:17.959]  He said, I have $270 million.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.722]  He said, I personally made $70 million last year.
[00:21:22.703 --> 00:21:28.326]  He said that all this stuff, and I'm sitting there watching this, it was fantasy land.
[00:21:28.706 --> 00:21:34.010]  But that's why the jury then thought, well, give him $40 million, because Alex Jones has it.
[00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:40.427]   But that's why it's a joke, because bankruptcy court We'll show that we don't have all this money.
[00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:43.390]  Oh, in fact, it was an absurd calculation.
[00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:50.135]  Nobody would do a media company analysis and say it's worth $200, $100, $50, $10 million.
[00:21:50.636 --> 00:21:51.836]  You said $270 million.
[00:21:52.117 --> 00:21:52.377]  $270 million.
[00:21:52.677 --> 00:21:57.881]  No one would say anything like that with a media company that doesn't even have its talent under contract anyway.
[00:21:57.981 --> 00:22:03.245]  So, I mean, it's a patently insane calculation, not based on any economic assessment.
[00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:04.226]  But explain how that works.
[00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:12.056]   I'm not comparing myself to Michael Jordan, but they're like, They're trying to blow up Bulls Stadium because Michael Jordan and his prime is playing there.
[00:22:13.018 --> 00:22:17.662]  But Michael Jordan, if they burn down the stadium, he just goes and works for the Lakers or for whoever he wants.
[00:22:17.682 --> 00:22:24.708]  The point is, is that they see me as the Michael Jordan of populist, conservative, anti-globalism, and we are.
[00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:25.328]  The listeners are.
[00:22:25.689 --> 00:22:26.609]  This whole family is.
[00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:27.710]  We are Michael Jordan together.
[00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:36.998]  But they still don't get... I was sitting there in like the fifth deposition they have of me for Connecticut, and he goes, what is the most valuable asset of InfoWars?
[00:22:37.699 --> 00:22:38.379]  I said, it's me.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:47.667]  But, like, they think, like, I'm loyal to the audience, I'm loyal to the crew, I'm loyal to this infrastructure, but I can go anywhere and do the show, everybody's gonna come anyways.
[00:22:47.908 --> 00:22:48.048]  Right.
[00:22:48.248 --> 00:22:51.211]  So they don't even, they're like, he's over, it's over.
[00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:55.554]  No, this big operation, this crew I'm loyal to, was set up back when we were on social media.
[00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:58.577]  I've just kept them employed and spent all my personal money.
[00:22:58.717 --> 00:23:00.018]  I'm out of money keeping them employed.
[00:23:00.238 --> 00:23:01.399]  It's like this ridiculous joke!
[00:23:01.419 --> 00:23:02.420]  Oh, completely.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.822]  What they don't understand is they can't, in fact, shut down the audience.
[00:23:06.243 --> 00:23:07.644]  They can't suppress the audience.
[00:23:07.664 --> 00:23:13.248]  They can't really shut down or suppress your voice, and they can't shut down and suppress the audience from supporting that voice.
[00:23:13.268 --> 00:23:13.568]  That's right.
[00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:19.292]  As long as we can have somewhere that's a beachhead, even if I don't own it, and I'm on air, they can't shut that down.
[00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:19.893]  Exactly.
[00:23:19.953 --> 00:23:20.693]  And that's their problem.
[00:23:20.793 --> 00:23:25.501]   And all they're making me do is do that. Right, they're making you be creative and
[00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:30.662]   intelligent and informed and be strategically ahead of the curve to fight the system and fight the man on their own
[00:23:30.662 --> 00:23:31.261]  terms.
[00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:37.441]   And that's all they're really doing. And because the thing they've never understood is they've always thought that the
[00:23:37.441 --> 00:23:40.261]  audience was kind of fake and that you were kind of fake.
[00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:43.261]  And they didn't understand it couldn't be more opposite.
[00:23:43.261 --> 00:23:46.390]  The reason the audience exists is because of how real it is.
[00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.261]   And the reason you exist is because of how authentic you are.
[00:23:49.261 --> 00:23:53.261]   So that's what they don't understand. They cannot crush the American spirit.
[00:23:53.261 --> 00:23:57.261]   That's it. And they believe they can crush me and they can crush you. And I'm not just saying that.
[00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.694]  This is a battle of wills, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:01.277 --> 00:24:01.878]  That's why now...
[00:24:04.594 --> 00:24:13.063]  I'm quite frankly surprised, because listeners are so used to us being steadfast, so used to us being resilient, that they're like, OK, well Jones has said he's close to oblivion quite a bit.
[00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:15.965]  We're getting a little extra support, but not what we should.
[00:24:16.766 --> 00:24:23.253]  And I think if it becomes evident where we actually do start shutting down, we'll have a lot of support, and then we'll try to reorganize and do something.
[00:24:23.293 --> 00:24:25.315]  But now's the time to support, if you ever were.
[00:24:25.655 --> 00:24:35.259]  Oh, no doubt, because this is what keeps InfoWars alive on a monthly basis, that pays all the salaries, that makes sure that it's broadcast can continue to be made, and continue to be distributed, and continue to be shared.
[00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:39.121]  So as long as the audience holds the line, they cannot breach that line.
[00:24:39.141 --> 00:24:45.884]  And Robert, how beautiful it is, is it, that there's no extra money, so they're doing these huge expenditures and long-time wars to shut us down.
[00:24:46.984 --> 00:24:53.910]  And we're just, our listeners just hold the line in a stalemate while the new world order comes out in the open and our credibility goes way up.
[00:24:54.391 --> 00:24:57.113]  They don't understand, like, every month our credibility goes up.
[00:24:57.513 --> 00:24:58.975]  Every month their credibility goes down.
[00:24:59.395 --> 00:25:03.859]  They don't understand, like, they think we're strangling us, and they don't understand, no, it's the other way around.
[00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:04.439]  Precisely.
[00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.360]  It's very much like the Battle of Bunker Hill.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:14.543]  They thought they would win, and the British did win the Battle of Bunker Hill, but they lost the ultimate battle of the spirit and the soul because of how people fought back and resisted.
[00:25:14.823 --> 00:25:35.451]   So as long as the people hold the line, as long as they see InfoWars is still there, as long as they hear Alex Jones' voice is still heard, as long as the people are continued to get what they want to get and to distribute it accordingly and have heard and have listened to what they want to have heard and listened to, Then that will break down their ability to crush the populist movement and the American freedom movement.
[00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:39.453]  Well, Robert, they're always saying I'm this Machiavellian genius, and I'm not.
[00:25:39.513 --> 00:25:41.394]  I just go with my guts and what I think's right.
[00:25:41.655 --> 00:25:41.815]  Yes.
[00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:48.339]  And what they don't understand is if I was Machiavelli, I'd shut this down and disappear for six months.
[00:25:49.159 --> 00:25:53.442]  The minute I came back anywhere, it would have hundreds of millions of views.
[00:25:54.369 --> 00:25:56.852]  But I don't want to do that because of my crew and everything else.
[00:25:57.632 --> 00:25:58.834]  But they just, they don't even know.
[00:25:58.854 --> 00:26:00.215]  They don't even know how media works.
[00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:01.757]  It's like, it's really bizarre.
[00:26:02.037 --> 00:26:12.228]  They don't even get that as long as we stay on air and don't let them convince us that we've lost and convince us we've been silenced and convince us we're bad or they're the ones that lie on purpose, we make mistakes.
[00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:14.991]  We just got bigger from this!
[00:26:15.551 --> 00:26:18.312]  More people than ever are going to want to know, well, what is this forbidden thing?
[00:26:18.653 --> 00:26:20.153]  What is this fruit I'm not supposed to have?
[00:26:20.573 --> 00:26:20.994]  Oh, exactly.
[00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:23.655]  Well, you nuke Alex Jones, you get Godzilla.
[00:26:23.975 --> 00:26:24.976]  You don't get Hiroshima.
[00:26:25.336 --> 00:26:31.699]  And I think that's what they still don't understand and that they still won't understand as long as the people hold the line.
[00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:33.020]  Everybody holds the line.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.881]  They will not be able to breach the line.
[00:26:35.221 --> 00:26:36.001]  And that's the key.
[00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:39.103]  But that's a great analogy from the latest Godzilla movie.
[00:26:40.003 --> 00:26:43.144]  When they nuked Godzilla, that's when he really gets powerful, because he was made out of radiation.
[00:26:43.485 --> 00:26:43.765]  Exactly.
[00:26:43.785 --> 00:26:44.665]  And that's what they don't understand.
[00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:50.248]  It's not fun being nuked, but I tell you, it's a little... Well, I mean, hey, you might as well live in interesting times.
[00:26:50.588 --> 00:26:51.869]  And so it's the willy.
[00:26:52.109 --> 00:26:58.311]  Every great story needs a great crisis, needs a great obstacle, needs a great difficulty.
[00:26:58.572 --> 00:27:03.514]  It's what gives the story its moral weight and moral power and potency.
[00:27:03.954 --> 00:27:04.875]  And that's no different here.
[00:27:04.975 --> 00:27:10.739]  This is the system's attempt to take out populist independent voices by every means possible.
[00:27:11.119 --> 00:27:25.648]  And the reality is they can't because they can't crush the soul and the spirit of working-class ordinary Americans who will hold the line, have held the line, and that is why freedom stays alive is because of ordinary people like the audience holding the line.
[00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:26.889]  I totally agree.
[00:27:26.929 --> 00:27:28.490]  Let's play some of these clips we promised to.
[00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.311]  I spent hours getting these together.
[00:27:30.331 --> 00:27:31.272]  We haven't played one yet.
[00:27:32.053 --> 00:27:35.138]   Let's play Clip 21.
[00:27:35.458 --> 00:27:36.579]  Here they are in closing arguments.
[00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:37.360]  This is just part of it.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.983]  They say take away his megaphone, shut him down, he's patient, zero, send a message.
[00:27:42.364 --> 00:27:44.486]  This is their declaration of war against the First Amendment.
[00:27:44.946 --> 00:27:50.271]  Fashioning Sandy Hook not just into a Second Amendment killing operation, but a First Amendment killing operation.
[00:27:50.291 --> 00:27:50.651]  Here it is.
[00:27:51.792 --> 00:28:00.483]   I ask that with your verdict you not only Take Alex Jones' platform that he talks about away.
[00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:05.566]  I ask that you make certain he can't rebuild the platform.
[00:28:06.047 --> 00:28:07.067]  That's what matters.
[00:28:09.168 --> 00:28:19.354]  Take him out of this discourse, of this misinformation, of this peddling of lies, and make sure he can't do it again.
[00:28:20.975 --> 00:28:22.016]  That is punishment.
[00:28:22.796 --> 00:28:29.796]  That is deterrence.
[00:28:29.796 --> 00:28:34.796]  This information spreads six times faster than the truth.
[00:28:35.303 --> 00:28:39.905]  That's what we heard on that stand, and I believe it.
[00:28:39.945 --> 00:28:43.347]  Alex Jones found a way to monetize that.
[00:28:44.408 --> 00:28:46.549]  Boy, did he find a way to monetize it.
[00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:55.394]  And in monetizing that, he made a wealth, a huge, huge amount of money.
[00:28:57.203 --> 00:29:02.046]  I hope that we never see someone like him again.
[00:29:03.927 --> 00:29:06.548]  I hope that with your verdict he can go away.
[00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:18.335]  Alex Jones is patient zero for our society's inability to speak without lies.
[00:29:19.976 --> 00:29:20.576]  I believe it.
[00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:27.381]  He is patient zero for alternative facts.
[00:29:28.721 --> 00:29:29.842]  You heard it on that stand.
[00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:30.722]  Ms.
[00:29:30.742 --> 00:29:36.944]  Karpova on that stand literally used the words alternative facts or alternative reality, something like that.
[00:29:39.745 --> 00:29:40.306]  Sickening.
[00:29:41.706 --> 00:29:42.226]  Sickening.
[00:29:42.406 --> 00:29:43.667]  Two men can have a baby.
[00:29:43.747 --> 00:29:45.288]  Two women can have a baby in prison.
[00:29:46.548 --> 00:29:47.889]  Two plus two equals seven.
[00:29:48.969 --> 00:29:50.109]  Open borders is good.
[00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:51.370]  Joe Biden really got elected.
[00:29:52.402 --> 00:29:53.804]  Inflation isn't inflation.
[00:29:55.446 --> 00:29:57.888]  We're not in a recession, but a recession's not that bad.
[00:29:57.908 --> 00:30:00.531]  It goes on.
[00:30:00.751 --> 00:30:02.934]  There's like 10 minutes I want to play on the Sunday show tomorrow.
[00:30:03.334 --> 00:30:07.239]  His whole closing deal was just like, take his megaphone away.
[00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:08.220]  Ban everybody else.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:09.541]  It starts with him.
[00:30:09.561 --> 00:30:11.003]  Now we'll have the truth.
[00:30:11.463 --> 00:30:12.064]  Well, put it this way.
[00:30:12.104 --> 00:30:14.507]  If you had said what he had said, they would have accused you of a death threat.
[00:30:14.787 --> 00:30:14.987]  Right?
[00:30:15.227 --> 00:30:16.329]  Take him out.
[00:30:16.629 --> 00:30:17.170]  Those are his words.
[00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.311]  And listen to the way he said it.
[00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:19.292]  Take him out.
[00:30:19.512 --> 00:30:20.173]  Take him out.
[00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:21.535]  That's the language being used.
[00:30:21.875 --> 00:30:24.378]  Never let someone like him ever show up again.
[00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:26.320]  That's what this case has been about.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.441]  Send a message to everybody.
[00:30:27.461 --> 00:30:29.002]  You shut up, you dirty Americans.
[00:30:29.463 --> 00:30:30.884]  You flyover country scum.
[00:30:31.244 --> 00:30:33.246]  Or we will take you out.
[00:30:33.486 --> 00:30:35.688]  That's the message that they want the world to hear.
[00:30:35.748 --> 00:30:37.990]  That's the message they want the world to fear.
[00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:41.053]  And that is why it is so critical people continue to hold the line.
[00:30:41.313 --> 00:30:42.855]  Well, that's right.
[00:30:42.895 --> 00:30:44.536]  I mean, look.
[00:30:44.697 --> 00:30:45.918]  Ain't no retiring now.
[00:30:46.038 --> 00:30:48.660]  Ain't no going into lower gear now.
[00:30:51.226 --> 00:30:54.911]  Let me tell you, these people with their statements gave me more energy than I've ever had.
[00:30:55.032 --> 00:30:55.612]  It's on.
[00:30:55.632 --> 00:31:00.840]  You know, they have the phone and the secret contacts with Vlad, and you know, they were supposed to be going over to Moscow soon or whatever.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:04.445]  Oh, I'm going to play more of their clips, but let's talk about that.
[00:31:05.026 --> 00:31:06.188]  It's six months of my phone.
[00:31:07.714 --> 00:31:09.195]  Late 2019, early 2020.
[00:31:09.996 --> 00:31:11.037]  It's some CPAC stuff.
[00:31:11.998 --> 00:31:14.640]  And it's pictures of my wife and me and the kids and stuff like that.
[00:31:15.401 --> 00:31:18.964]  And I gave Texas and I gave Connecticut the phones.
[00:31:19.425 --> 00:31:21.407]  They were searching them in six-month tranches.
[00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:26.852]  And the paralegal left like a six-month raw thing in there.
[00:31:27.392 --> 00:31:28.113]  And we all went through it.
[00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:28.753]  There's nothing there.
[00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:30.742]  We didn't do anything wrong anyways.
[00:31:31.522 --> 00:31:33.223]  And so he's like, we have two years.
[00:31:33.263 --> 00:31:34.404]  We have the whole phone.
[00:31:34.444 --> 00:31:35.144]  That was not true.
[00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:35.804]  Yeah.
[00:31:35.945 --> 00:31:37.465]  Like they have Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:31:37.786 --> 00:31:39.146]  And of course, well, where's the crack pipes?
[00:31:39.206 --> 00:31:39.827]  Where's the whores?
[00:31:39.847 --> 00:31:40.987]  Where's the, sorry.
[00:31:41.308 --> 00:31:43.509]  I mean, there was a photo.
[00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:45.170]  I sent my wife or her naked.
[00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:45.530]  Okay.
[00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:46.050]  They got that.
[00:31:46.551 --> 00:31:48.011]  So my wife looks pretty good.
[00:31:48.052 --> 00:31:48.272]  Go ahead.
[00:31:48.332 --> 00:31:51.934]  I mean, the point is, is that there's one naked picture of my wife in there.
[00:31:52.334 --> 00:31:53.875]  So that's what they've got.
[00:31:54.455 --> 00:31:57.417]  And it's just no dick pics, no nothing.
[00:31:58.264 --> 00:32:01.545]  So, so, so, so, I mean, I'm a hard-working guy, guys.
[00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:03.226]  I'm not like running around party time here.
[00:32:03.806 --> 00:32:09.888]  I wish I was, but that's what's so insane about this is they tell you that and they act like that.
[00:32:09.988 --> 00:32:11.268]  Oh, January 6th has got it.
[00:32:11.588 --> 00:32:12.489]  It isn't even in 2021.
[00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:14.670]  It's from 2019.
[00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.932]  Yeah, it's more fake news.
[00:32:18.332 --> 00:32:27.599]  And it's an attempt to sort of... I mean, what's extraordinary is they got to see a microscopic up-close view of InfoWars and Alex Jones and they couldn't produce any incriminatory information.
[00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:29.721]  That's why they had... They had one text message about Paul.
[00:32:30.661 --> 00:32:31.482]  This looks like a B.S.
[00:32:31.502 --> 00:32:32.822]  Sandy Hook story.
[00:32:32.922 --> 00:32:35.544]  Exactly, which had nothing to do with Sandy Hook.
[00:32:35.644 --> 00:32:38.425]  Oh, we have your phone, and here it is!
[00:32:39.786 --> 00:32:42.407]  There's no basis of a criminal case whatsoever.
[00:32:42.448 --> 00:32:43.308]  There's no perjury.
[00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:44.088]  There's no lies.
[00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:45.809]  There never was discovery abuses.
[00:32:45.829 --> 00:32:50.112]  The only lies were the courts trying to make up stories about what existed and didn't exist.
[00:32:50.352 --> 00:32:54.174]  Well, the evidence that, basically, it was, give us the evidence that you're guilty.
[00:32:54.314 --> 00:32:55.995]  Well, I'm innocent, Your Honor.
[00:32:56.175 --> 00:32:59.397]  Okay, I will declare that you're guilty because you declared yourself innocent.
[00:33:00.017 --> 00:33:01.858]  They go, intimate Roger Stone text.
[00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:05.320]  It's like Roger saying, yeah, my wife fell and broke her leg.
[00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.441]  God, it's hard.
[00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:08.702]  Somebody just beat us up in the parking lot.
[00:33:09.263 --> 00:33:10.463]  I'm like, I'm so sorry, man.
[00:33:10.623 --> 00:33:11.464]  And that's intimate.
[00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:12.284]  Yeah, I know.
[00:33:12.545 --> 00:33:13.965]  I mean, all of it's just one thing.
[00:33:14.186 --> 00:33:18.308]  If there was anything there, it would be on the front page of CNN and The New York Times and everywhere else.
[00:33:18.348 --> 00:33:20.810]  It would have already been fully disclosed and revealed and released.
[00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.170]  There isn't anything there.
[00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.991]  It's like Trump.
[00:33:23.251 --> 00:33:30.136]  In other words, they get to do a macroscopic, microscopic look at your entire life, and all they can come up with is pretty much nothing.
[00:33:30.517 --> 00:33:32.218]  And that's because that's the reality and the truth.
[00:33:32.258 --> 00:33:35.060]  I remember somebody asked me, you know, what are the secrets of Alex Jones?
[00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:40.965]  Like, the real secrets, if you've got a sneak peek of his life, is he likes barbecue, he likes steak, he likes women, he likes water.
[00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.167]  I was about to say, his messages are like, will you go get me a T-bone?
[00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:44.087]  Yeah, exactly!
[00:33:44.327 --> 00:33:50.889]  I mean, he loves fireworks, he loves July 4th, he loves being out on the lake, he loves shooting guns that are fun in safe places.
[00:33:51.289 --> 00:33:52.289]  That's who Alex Jones is.
[00:33:52.329 --> 00:33:54.430]  That's the deep, dark secret of Alex Jones.
[00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:58.031]  If you've got a sneak peek into Alex Jones' life, that's what you find.
[00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:01.792]  An old-fashioned, old-school, true American.
[00:34:02.152 --> 00:34:04.333]  That's what drives them as crazy as anything else.
[00:34:04.973 --> 00:34:09.734]  Imagine how frustrated they were to have six months on my phone and there's one naked picture of my wife.
[00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:11.060]  I don't know.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.261]  There's nothing there.
[00:34:12.601 --> 00:34:13.141]  Put it this way.
[00:34:13.261 --> 00:34:14.202]  That's my wife!
[00:34:14.943 --> 00:34:16.444]  I consider confession through projection.
[00:34:16.624 --> 00:34:22.548]  You can imagine what's on some of these people's phones, and what's on some of these people's computer profiles, and what's on some of these people's search engines.
[00:34:22.888 --> 00:34:28.933]  I mean, you can just look at some of the social media of some of the people who follow this Alex Jones hate community.
[00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:35.358]  And go, hmm, these people you don't want around your daughter, these people you don't want to be within a mile of if you can avoid it.
[00:34:35.578 --> 00:34:38.500]  You definitely don't want to be in a dark alley or a bedroom with them, that's for sure.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.582]  It's that kind of vibe that you get.
[00:34:40.842 --> 00:34:45.645]   They project their own sins upon those they accuse when in fact Absolutely.
[00:34:45.665 --> 00:34:46.866]  So, let's play a few more clips here.
[00:34:46.706 --> 00:34:48.226]  those people they're criticizing.
[00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:49.266]  And that's what they found.
[00:34:49.266 --> 00:34:52.486]   They got to do the whole review, and at the end of the day,
[00:34:52.486 --> 00:34:57.485]   they couldn't find anything of consequence, and that's why they got stuck talking big.
[00:34:57.485 --> 00:34:59.346]  And how do they say it in Texas?
[00:34:59.346 --> 00:35:00.945]  All hat, no cattle.
[00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:01.786]  Absolutely.
[00:35:01.786 --> 00:35:05.026]  So let's play a few more clips here.
[00:35:05.026 --> 00:35:11.405]   Here is the judge scolding me for lying, saying I'm in bankruptcy,
[00:35:12.385 --> 00:35:17.385]  and scolding me for saying I'm innocent.
[00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.263]  Because you're not allowed to do that in America.
[00:35:19.803 --> 00:35:20.924]  And then let's play clip 23.
[00:35:21.144 --> 00:35:22.624]  Let's play these back-to-back.
[00:35:23.105 --> 00:35:25.326]  This is Bankston talking about his master plan.
[00:35:25.346 --> 00:35:25.686]  Here it is.
[00:35:27.407 --> 00:35:33.530]  You may not say to this jury that you comply with Discover.
[00:35:35.011 --> 00:35:36.132]  That is not true.
[00:35:36.932 --> 00:35:38.333]  You may not say it again.
[00:35:38.973 --> 00:35:42.315]  You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt.
[00:35:42.855 --> 00:35:44.536]  That is also not true.
[00:35:45.077 --> 00:35:47.439]  You're already under oath to tell the truth.
[00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:54.944]  You've already violated that oath twice today in just those two examples.
[00:35:55.784 --> 00:36:05.211]  It seems absurd to instruct you again that you must tell the truth while you testify, yet here I am.
[00:36:05.551 --> 00:36:08.353]  You must tell the truth while you testify.
[00:36:08.894 --> 00:36:10.896]  This is not your show.
[00:36:11.136 --> 00:36:13.678]  Do you understand what I have said?
[00:36:14.178 --> 00:36:14.458]  Yes.
[00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:15.879]  I believe what I said was true.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.882]  So I don't... Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[00:36:20.203 --> 00:36:22.164]  Your beliefs do not make something true.
[00:36:22.865 --> 00:36:25.667]  That is... that is what we're doing here.
[00:36:26.447 --> 00:36:28.069]  Just because you claim... Pause.
[00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.689]  Back this up.
[00:36:28.709 --> 00:36:29.510]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:39.545]  This is literally 1984, where Winston is torturing him to death, or O'Brien is torturing Winston to death, and he says, it doesn't matter what your eyes see, I'm reality.
[00:36:40.105 --> 00:36:42.306]  I mean, this is creep-fest, man.
[00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:45.436]  You know, what's the answer?
[00:36:45.456 --> 00:36:45.916]  2 plus 2.
[00:36:46.076 --> 00:36:46.776]  Oh, it's 4.
[00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:47.717]  Zap!
[00:36:48.117 --> 00:36:48.717]  No, no.
[00:36:48.737 --> 00:36:49.538]  2 plus 2 is 5.
[00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:50.958]  2 plus 2 is 5.
[00:36:51.318 --> 00:36:51.739]  And why?
[00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:53.559]  Because I say it is.
[00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:55.020]  And that's exactly what the judge says.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.022]  The judge says, I know you believe this to be true, but the only truth is what I say is true.
[00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:02.704]  That's even earlier said the truth is in this courtroom.
[00:37:02.964 --> 00:37:03.604]  Yeah.
[00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:04.524]  Start the clip over.
[00:37:05.365 --> 00:37:06.085]  Start the clip over.
[00:37:06.125 --> 00:37:06.505]  Here it is.
[00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:13.636]  You may not say to this jury that you comply with Discover.
[00:37:13.636 --> 00:37:16.925]  That is not true.
[00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:18.589]  You may not say it again.
[00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.531]  You may not tell this jury that you are bankrupt.
[00:37:23.091 --> 00:37:24.912]  That is also not true.
[00:37:25.332 --> 00:37:27.693]  You're already under oath to tell the truth.
[00:37:28.893 --> 00:37:35.196]  You've already violated that oath twice today in just those two examples.
[00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:45.398]   It seems absurd to instruct you again That you must tell the truth while you testify, yet here I am.
[00:37:45.798 --> 00:37:48.679]  You must tell the truth while you testify.
[00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:51.140]  This is not your show.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.920]  Do you understand what I have said?
[00:37:54.421 --> 00:37:54.741]  Yes.
[00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:56.141]  I believe what I said was true.
[00:37:57.081 --> 00:38:00.122]  Yes, you believe everything you say is true, but it isn't.
[00:38:00.462 --> 00:38:02.423]  Your beliefs do not make something true.
[00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:05.924]  That is what we're doing here.
[00:38:06.764 --> 00:38:10.605]  Just because you claim to think something is true does not make it true.
[00:38:11.061 --> 00:38:12.182]  It does not protect you.
[00:38:12.563 --> 00:38:13.824]  It is not allowed.
[00:38:16.507 --> 00:38:19.189]  I mean, this is North Korea.
[00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.732]  Yeah, and when you heard her say it, this is not your show.
[00:38:22.052 --> 00:38:23.274]  You know what she was wanting to say.
[00:38:23.294 --> 00:38:23.854]  This is my show.
[00:38:24.074 --> 00:38:24.595]  Exactly.
[00:38:25.035 --> 00:38:27.998]  And the judge is supposed to be an impartial referee.
[00:38:28.399 --> 00:38:33.864]  Imagine if you went to a football game and you saw the referee, the umpire, wearing the uniform of one of the teams.
[00:38:34.705 --> 00:38:40.149]  And then tell one of the teams, okay, your opponent can have 11 players, you can only have 5.
[00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.632]  They can throw a forward pass, you cannot.
[00:38:44.613 --> 00:38:46.574]  They can have certain blockers, you cannot.
[00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:56.622]  And then we'll throw, like I think they counted it up, 110, 115 objections, she sustained from the plaintiffs, and only like 8 or 9 she sustained from your side.
[00:38:56.902 --> 00:39:00.765]  I mean, imagine if all they did was throw flags on one side the entire game.
[00:39:01.085 --> 00:39:03.047]  Everybody would be like, this is a complete crock.
[00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:06.541]  Why is she so arrogant?
[00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:13.541]   Because this is what, if people wondered what does a social justice warrior who becomes a judge look like?
[00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.541]  You got to see a real live example.
[00:39:15.541 --> 00:39:21.541]   And again the difference is the Soviets and the Stasys and the Nazis, they knew how to run an actual show trial.
[00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:25.541]   The Cubans knew how to run an actual show trial so that at least it looked good.
[00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:28.761]  This looked like a disgrace.
[00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:32.943]  This made idiocracy look like an ideal version of justice.
[00:39:33.244 --> 00:39:39.748]  That's how bad this case was, how egregious it was, and it's why they did what they did and why they had to do what they had to do.
[00:39:40.028 --> 00:39:47.133]  If they had confidence in the facts, if they had confidence in the law, they would have allowed an open, impartial jury and had a neutral, fair judge.
[00:39:47.273 --> 00:39:47.613]  I agree.
[00:39:47.633 --> 00:39:49.755]  I also love how they said my cough is fake.
[00:39:49.775 --> 00:39:51.056]  I've been laryngitis for two weeks.
[00:39:51.676 --> 00:39:53.197]  I'm driving the crew crazy doing it.
[00:39:54.257 --> 00:39:56.838]  Why would I fake cough and have tears in my eyes?
[00:39:57.058 --> 00:40:02.320]  Because at one point he's asking me questions and I got tears in my eyes because my laryngitis and my larynx is torn up.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.141]  And they're like, why are you fake coughing?
[00:40:05.201 --> 00:40:06.602]  Like, what the hell does that even mean?
[00:40:06.862 --> 00:40:10.083]  Well, I remember when he asked you, he goes, well, I don't hear you coughing on the air.
[00:40:10.383 --> 00:40:12.724]  He's like, that's why I have a cough button.
[00:40:13.084 --> 00:40:16.327]  I mean, anybody who knows you and has been around you knows that's the case.
[00:40:16.387 --> 00:40:19.410]  I mean, that's the kind of patent absurdity they were trying to make up.
[00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.733]  This was about scripting a narrative that was fake.
[00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:29.879]  If any aspect of it was deeply true, they would have allowed all the evidence in, they wouldn't have violated all the rules, they would have allowed a trial by jury.
[00:40:29.899 --> 00:40:31.600]  This is a perfect microcosm.
[00:40:32.281 --> 00:40:34.963]  We're not going to be spending two years going up to the Texas Supreme Court or whatever.
[00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:36.504]  Nobody's going to waste their money doing that.
[00:40:36.324 --> 00:40:39.483]  You can see that, where they create a whole false reality.
[00:40:39.483 --> 00:40:41.123]  It's like a live mushroom strategy.
[00:40:41.123 --> 00:40:43.123]  You know, you keep them in the dark and feed them crap.
[00:40:43.123 --> 00:40:44.123]  Just keep doing it.
[00:40:44.123 --> 00:40:45.124]  I agree.
[00:40:45.124 --> 00:40:47.124]  Let's go to the Bankston clip.
[00:40:47.124 --> 00:40:51.483]   This is him yesterday evening coming out after his victory and putting out all these weird
[00:40:51.483 --> 00:40:54.563]   theories how they're going to chop up our corpse and serve it.
[00:40:54.563 --> 00:40:55.563]  Here it is.
[00:40:55.563 --> 00:40:58.923]   We're not going to be spending two years going up to the Texas Supreme Court or whatever.
[00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:00.604]  Nobody's going to waste their money doing that.
[00:41:00.604 --> 00:41:02.403]  We're going to this bankruptcy court.
[00:41:02.403 --> 00:41:05.604]   And those claims are going to have to get valued and resolved in that bankruptcy estate.
[00:41:05.615 --> 00:41:12.820]  And when we have a litigable basis to potentially wrap this case up for years and then ultimately collect our entire punitive damage argument?
[00:41:13.481 --> 00:41:16.743]  Yeah, there's going to be a resolution made on to what these claims are valued at.
[00:41:17.063 --> 00:41:22.847]  And that's also going to have to take into account what the Lafferty claims are valued at, and the Posner claims are valued at, and the Fontaine claims are valued at.
[00:41:23.387 --> 00:41:32.979]   And that is why I've been saying that what this is heading towards Is there going to be a large set of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of InfoWars and the bankruptcy estate?
[00:41:33.299 --> 00:41:40.602]  And over the course of that process, that could get very, very dangerous for Mr. Jones, because there is going to be a new level of financial scrutiny.
[00:41:41.302 --> 00:41:53.047]  And if, you know, some lawyer like me can basically find out that he's hiding the keys to the candy store, pull it out in front of him on the stand, I can only imagine what Federal Receipt is going to do.
[00:41:53.247 --> 00:41:54.988]  So yeah, it's going to get interesting from here on out.
[00:41:56.411 --> 00:41:59.473]  They think InfoWars is the candy store.
[00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:03.835]  Well, you can tell that, well, I don't want to say what comes to mind.
[00:42:04.015 --> 00:42:07.797]  I mean, the point is, is that you've seen the finances here.
[00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:08.417]  It's so funny.
[00:42:09.318 --> 00:42:10.298]  They're drilling a dry well.
[00:42:10.999 --> 00:42:14.220]  And they just can't imagine that they project this stuff onto us.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.401]  But what do you make of those claims?
[00:42:16.902 --> 00:42:20.543]  So, I mean, I think some of this has been, there was definitely some confession through projection there.
[00:42:20.603 --> 00:42:22.484]  The way his eyes lit up at candy store.
[00:42:22.765 --> 00:42:24.686]  I don't want to know why he goes to a candy store.
[00:42:24.706 --> 00:42:25.346]  I'll put it that way.
[00:42:26.206 --> 00:42:27.067]  Or what he means by it.
[00:42:27.347 --> 00:42:33.449]  But I think the nature of what's sort of taking place in general is a belief of the caricature of you from Homeland Season 6.
[00:42:34.009 --> 00:42:35.449]  They still think... They believe that!
[00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:36.250]  I've run the Democrats!
[00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.250]  Absolutely.
[00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:45.613]  They can't imagine that there's this huge group of Americans who deeply believe in liberty and freedom and will fight for it till the day they die.
[00:42:45.953 --> 00:42:51.657]  They can't believe that there's generations of it, that this goes back generations, that the future generations are the same way.
[00:42:51.897 --> 00:42:53.998]  They can't imagine that world exists.
[00:42:54.318 --> 00:42:57.580]  It requires too much cognitive dissonance for them to absorb.
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.661]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:42:58.821 --> 00:43:04.545]  If I wanted my enemies to fight me, I would say, I will destroy you.
[00:43:04.645 --> 00:43:05.265]  You're over.
[00:43:05.405 --> 00:43:06.486]  I'm going to dominate you.
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.601]  Don't they know what they're doing?
[00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:13.543]  Like, do they not know the gold with our audience?
[00:43:14.003 --> 00:43:15.644]  Them saying we're going to cut up his corpse?
[00:43:16.104 --> 00:43:17.705]  We're going to shut them down?
[00:43:17.926 --> 00:43:19.727]  We're going to shut all these Americans down?
[00:43:19.987 --> 00:43:25.010]  They literally just declared war on the middle class in America and the Midwest.
[00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.610]  Completely.
[00:43:27.251 --> 00:43:32.215]  These are people who still imagine, they're like the old Brits, who can't imagine there's a bunch of Paul Revere's out there.
[00:43:32.255 --> 00:43:34.096]  They can't conceive of that world.
[00:43:34.776 --> 00:43:41.581]  And consequently, they have this caricature of you, and that's what they're going to divvy up, is the caricature, because that person doesn't exist.
[00:43:41.861 --> 00:43:42.722]  That version of him.
[00:43:42.742 --> 00:43:43.782]  But there's no money!
[00:43:44.043 --> 00:43:44.463]  That's what I mean.
[00:43:44.523 --> 00:43:46.284]  I could go anywhere and have a huge audience.
[00:43:46.324 --> 00:43:48.345]  I'm being loyal to my crew, I love it, it was a great job.
[00:43:48.586 --> 00:43:52.848]  Like, they keep acting like there's some spoil, as if this is the spoil.
[00:43:53.729 --> 00:43:55.010]  I don't think of myself as that great.
[00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.430]  You're great.
[00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:56.050]  I love our guest.
[00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:56.691]  I love our host.
[00:43:56.991 --> 00:43:59.272]  But I mean, it's me, dumbasses!
[00:44:00.293 --> 00:44:04.876]  And that's why I said, oh, he's got to be very careful now that the feds are involved in his finances.
[00:44:05.896 --> 00:44:14.762]  As bad as the feds are, and as bad as bankruptcy is, it's better than these rig courts in Austin that are known to indict Rick Perry and Tom DeLay for no reason.
[00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:22.618]  We're certified in federal court what we have and what we've done, which is game over for you.
[00:44:22.638 --> 00:44:28.745]  Because you won't be able to tell your plaintiffs, I got $270 million when I ain't got $2 million.
[00:44:28.885 --> 00:44:30.527]  It's game over.
[00:44:30.787 --> 00:44:33.630]  So they act like, oh, we're going to run to the bankruptcy here.
[00:44:33.951 --> 00:44:35.072]  No, they're scared of that.
[00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:35.933]  Oh, exactly.
[00:44:35.953 --> 00:44:36.494]  It's game over.
[00:44:37.054 --> 00:44:39.777]  Oh yeah, and he also, he's probably as clueless about bankruptcy.
[00:44:39.938 --> 00:44:40.438]  He clearly is.
[00:44:40.478 --> 00:44:42.160]  You notice he's scared of the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.783]  He's like, oh, we're not going to have to deal with the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:44:44.823 --> 00:44:45.344]  Yes, they will.
[00:44:45.684 --> 00:44:46.766]  This is a bondable judgment.
[00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:48.207]  It will go up to the Texas Supreme Court.
[00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:50.930]  It will be decided by them at some point in the process.
[00:44:51.011 --> 00:44:53.974]  And if the Texas Supreme Court gets involved, it's game over for the plaintiffs.
[00:44:54.214 --> 00:44:55.556]  They throw out the case entirely.
[00:44:55.596 --> 00:44:57.038]  We already had like half a...
[00:44:57.818 --> 00:44:58.779]  We're one short of half.
[00:44:58.879 --> 00:45:08.783]  Only one justice short of them taking it and throwing this out from the very beginning because the very nature of the suit violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[00:45:09.144 --> 00:45:09.744]  Always has.
[00:45:09.884 --> 00:45:13.926]  Also violates Texas law on the definition of intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[00:45:14.346 --> 00:45:16.208]  So, consequently, they know they lose.
[00:45:16.248 --> 00:45:18.651]  And you can see that reflected in the way he talks about that.
[00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:21.474]  That he's nervous about that court finally stepping up.
[00:45:21.494 --> 00:45:24.838]  So, bottom line to listeners and our crew, because I've told the crew we're not going anywhere.
[00:45:25.459 --> 00:45:29.283]  And I've told the people running around like, oh, we're shutting down.
[00:45:29.303 --> 00:45:31.265]  I remember four years ago, we got deplatformed.
[00:45:31.946 --> 00:45:32.927]  Half the crew was going to quit.
[00:45:34.248 --> 00:45:39.092]  This crew is great, but some of the crew is like... And I'm like, listen, we have hardcore listeners that are going to back us.
[00:45:39.512 --> 00:45:40.713]  They're going to censor everybody now.
[00:45:41.133 --> 00:45:42.574]  We're going to be the leaders in the fight.
[00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:43.135]  It's okay.
[00:45:43.255 --> 00:45:43.855]  We were proven right.
[00:45:44.736 --> 00:45:47.698]  So, look, we will be shut down if viewers don't support us.
[00:45:49.266 --> 00:45:52.928]  If viewers don't buy the products, if viewers don't spread the word, yes, we'll be shut down.
[00:45:53.208 --> 00:45:54.669]  But it's not in Bankston's hands.
[00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:57.711]  It's not in this SJW judge's hands.
[00:45:57.751 --> 00:45:59.111]  It's not in Hillary Clinton's hands.
[00:45:59.471 --> 00:46:00.652]  It's not in Satan's hands.
[00:46:01.072 --> 00:46:02.573]  God helps those that help themselves.
[00:46:03.013 --> 00:46:04.474]  It is in your hands.
[00:46:04.534 --> 00:46:06.495]  And I'll be quite honest with you.
[00:46:07.296 --> 00:46:07.816]  I'm going to fight 100%.
[00:46:07.856 --> 00:46:11.018]  I'm going to do the best job I can.
[00:46:11.638 --> 00:46:14.660]  But if you take me out of the game, it was time for me to get off the field.
[00:46:16.135 --> 00:46:17.296]  Nothing but devastating victory.
[00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:20.498]  I'm like an old NFL quarterback ready to retire, okay?
[00:46:20.859 --> 00:46:23.320]  But I can't because this isn't football, folks.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:24.441]  This is our children's future.
[00:46:25.002 --> 00:46:27.003]  I'm telling you, I will never give up.
[00:46:27.403 --> 00:46:31.967]  But if you don't back us, and if you don't get how serious this is, you're next.
[00:46:32.407 --> 00:46:34.729]  So I can't quit and I will not quit.
[00:46:35.029 --> 00:46:39.472]  But if you quit, I have no power.
[00:46:40.253 --> 00:46:42.715]  And I say that with very humbly.
[00:46:43.899 --> 00:46:48.684]  Because I'm the opposite of these people that are in the power structure that feel powerful and screw folks over.
[00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:49.946]  I know I'm finite.
[00:46:50.246 --> 00:46:51.327]  I know I'm just flesh and blood.
[00:46:51.427 --> 00:46:52.108]  I know I'm weak.
[00:46:52.228 --> 00:46:53.109]  I know I'm gonna die.
[00:46:53.129 --> 00:46:54.851]  I'm the opposite.
[00:46:55.745 --> 00:47:00.369]  But I don't want to roll over to these people, so I need you to spread the word and pray for us.
[00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:05.033]  And I need you to support us financially, because I don't want to let these people break our back.
[00:47:05.494 --> 00:47:06.935]  Do you see what demons they are?
[00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:07.816]  No doubt.
[00:47:07.936 --> 00:47:09.997]  I mean, the goal is to simply hold the line.
[00:47:10.017 --> 00:47:11.138]  It's like the line from Braveheart.
[00:47:11.459 --> 00:47:13.841]  The reality, the power of Alex Jones is the power of the people.
[00:47:13.901 --> 00:47:16.123]  The threat of Alex Jones is the threat of the people.
[00:47:16.463 --> 00:47:21.887]  As long as the people keep Alex Jones and Infowars around, Alex Jones and Infowars will be around.
[00:47:22.187 --> 00:47:24.969]  Because you can't kill and crush everybody.
[00:47:25.269 --> 00:47:26.610]  You can't kill a spirit.
[00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:27.770]  You can't kill a message.
[00:47:28.051 --> 00:47:36.456]  And that's what will stay alive as long as ordinary everyday Americans carry the message and the torch of liberty that our ancestors gave us.
[00:47:38.277 --> 00:47:39.838]  By what they attack, what they fear.
[00:47:40.138 --> 00:47:44.480]  Despite all Trump's problems, he means well, and he loves America and freedom.
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.420]  I support him.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.940]  The Santas is even better.
[00:47:47.181 --> 00:47:49.401]  I support him.
[00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:50.842]  Kerry Lake, all this stuff.
[00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:52.183]  We're on the march.
[00:47:52.263 --> 00:47:53.403]  This is their fear.
[00:47:53.623 --> 00:47:57.405]  But if you won't back your champions, you're going to lose, folks.
[00:47:57.445 --> 00:47:58.985]  And I'm not bitching at you.
[00:47:59.646 --> 00:48:00.786]  I'm just telling you.
[00:48:01.226 --> 00:48:03.007]  I know the listeners are just like me.
[00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:05.009]  You're just regular folks.
[00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:06.211]  You don't want power.
[00:48:06.251 --> 00:48:06.992]  You don't want control.
[00:48:07.012 --> 00:48:07.973]  You want to keep your head down.
[00:48:08.013 --> 00:48:08.934]  You want to take care of your family.
[00:48:09.675 --> 00:48:10.176]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:10.196 --> 00:48:11.037]  You're not going to be able to do that.
[00:48:11.057 --> 00:48:11.698]  You've got to be leaders.
[00:48:12.719 --> 00:48:14.021]  And you've been leaders spreading the word.
[00:48:14.041 --> 00:48:15.082]  You've been leaders supporting us.
[00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:19.227]  But no matter what happens to me, folks, you're going to have to be those leaders.
[00:48:19.568 --> 00:48:21.230]  And I know we've inspired a lot of leaders.
[00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:22.161]  Oh, no doubt.
[00:48:22.261 --> 00:48:23.581]  And in fact, that's why it's there.
[00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:44.626]  If you look at it, when these kind of attempts have been made throughout American history, the Patrick Henry trial, his later speech, give me liberty or give me death, what happened in the 1950s, early 1960s with the South trying to suppress civil rights movements, the Chicago 7 trial at the end of the 60s trying to cover up the corrupt defense establishment, all of those were the despairing cries of a dying empire.
[00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:46.347]  And that's what we're seeing here.
[00:48:46.868 --> 00:48:55.094]  These desperate efforts to completely suppress and censor any independent voice is a sign that they are losing and on the verge of complete collapse.
[00:48:55.375 --> 00:49:02.961]  So they're reaching out and lashing out in this desperate effort to try to stop and prevent the spirit of American freedom from being heard.
[00:49:03.221 --> 00:49:09.206]  And as long as ordinary people continue to carry it, then it cannot be crushed like it hasn't been crushed for more than two centuries.
[00:49:09.206 --> 00:49:10.707]  All right, Robert Barnes, great job here.
[00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:12.928]  I'll be back tomorrow, Sunday night, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:49:13.369 --> 00:49:17.231]  ahead of the War Room Show they do Sunday live with Owen Schroeder, 6 to 8.
[00:49:17.531 --> 00:49:31.080]  But just in closing, because you do a great job, I'm interrupting constantly, recap this trial and the big takeaways, because I'm very pleased they had a declaration of war and said, we silenced Jones, we silenced them all, we're going to ban American speech.
[00:49:31.801 --> 00:49:41.010]   I mean, this was a horrific announcement and just a Statement of extreme hubris, which I see as weakness.
[00:49:41.551 --> 00:49:41.811]  No doubt.
[00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:44.492]  It was an attempt to lynch Alex Jones and kill InfoWars.
[00:49:44.672 --> 00:49:48.214]  To literally cut up the corpse and distribute it amongst their patrons and pals.
[00:49:48.594 --> 00:49:52.235]  The problem is, you are InfoWars, and InfoWars is you.
[00:49:52.716 --> 00:49:53.376]  And that's who they killed.
[00:49:53.416 --> 00:49:54.076]  That's what they've done!
[00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:56.858]  Deindustrialization, opening the borders, shipping in fentanyl.
[00:49:58.158 --> 00:50:00.339]  Screwing our veterans over, cutting off their benefits.
[00:50:00.619 --> 00:50:03.240]  They see America as a corpse that they're cutting up.
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:06.441]  They're externalizing who they are.
[00:50:06.881 --> 00:50:08.481]  We're not a corpse, we're alive!
[00:50:09.702 --> 00:50:10.122]  Exactly.
[00:50:10.602 --> 00:50:15.944]  And as everybody out there continues to hold the line, then Infowars will not only stay alive, but American freedom will stay alive in the process.
[00:50:16.304 --> 00:50:17.964]  And that's what they don't understand.
[00:50:18.284 --> 00:50:26.427]  What the corpse they're trying to cut up is actually just waking up, and that's the fear that they have, and they're about to live and experience that fear as they're unable to get up.
[00:50:26.527 --> 00:50:27.728]  Those are subconscious dreams.
[00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:28.848]  You're a corpse.
[00:50:28.888 --> 00:50:29.428]  You're dead.
[00:50:29.508 --> 00:50:31.769]  No, you are spiritually dead.
[00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:32.229]  Not us.
[00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:32.950]  Exactly.
[00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.351]  It's confession through projection, is what I call it often.
[00:50:35.391 --> 00:50:36.571]  Confession through accusation.
[00:50:36.892 --> 00:50:38.672]  And that's what you're seeing from this group of people.
[00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:39.613]  But now it's out in the open.
[00:50:39.653 --> 00:50:40.293]  Now it's clear.
[00:50:40.353 --> 00:50:42.214]  Now there's no doubts about what they're up to.
[00:50:42.474 --> 00:50:43.795]  No doubts about what their aims are.
[00:50:44.035 --> 00:50:46.556]  Why would they strategically admit it?
[00:50:47.196 --> 00:50:48.437]  I guess to please their funders.
[00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:55.583]  No, because they desperately need to intimidate and terrorize ordinary people into running for cover and not be willing to speak up for their ideas.
[00:50:55.683 --> 00:51:01.048]  Don't they get, like, when Hitler started bombing civilian targets, England, as you know, is 90% against the war.
[00:51:01.068 --> 00:51:06.212]  Because they'd lost millions, and they knew that they kind of started it with the Germans, so the Brits were smarter, like, no.
[00:51:06.513 --> 00:51:11.937]  But then Hitler was willing to be dealt with, and when he started bombing civilian targets, they went 99% pro-war.
[00:51:13.038 --> 00:51:13.178]  Yep.
[00:51:13.318 --> 00:51:18.459]  I mean, why does the left think messing with us and attacking us backs us down?
[00:51:18.779 --> 00:51:19.820]  All it does is wake us up.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.321]  Well, people who believe and idolize power only understand power.
[00:51:24.341 --> 00:51:25.861]  They only understand violence.
[00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:27.281]  They only understand control.
[00:51:27.581 --> 00:51:29.042]  They only understand suppression.
[00:51:29.302 --> 00:51:32.883]  They only understand punishment, like you heard that lawyer talk about.
[00:51:32.943 --> 00:51:33.263]  Punish!
[00:51:33.343 --> 00:51:33.643]  Punish!
[00:51:33.703 --> 00:51:34.163]  Take him out!
[00:51:34.323 --> 00:51:34.763]  Take him out!
[00:51:35.203 --> 00:51:36.845]  That's the only way they can think.
[00:51:36.965 --> 00:51:39.508]  It's just an un-American and un-humane way to think.
[00:51:39.868 --> 00:51:42.231]  It's the problem with their robotic system of governance.
[00:51:42.511 --> 00:51:48.878]  It's people who do not have a core soul of humanity or believe in it at a core level, and that is their ultimate limitation.
[00:51:48.918 --> 00:51:49.598]  But they think!
[00:51:50.299 --> 00:51:54.883]  Threatening us makes... Growing up in Dallas, you threaten people, you got your ass kicked.
[00:51:54.943 --> 00:51:57.726]  I mean, like, why do they think threatening us makes us scared?
[00:51:58.026 --> 00:51:59.408]  Because they're accustomed to it working.
[00:51:59.768 --> 00:52:01.029]  And in their minds, it does.
[00:52:01.149 --> 00:52:11.078]  I mean, it's just like, why would the Western powers push for a war in Ukraine that's counterproductive, try to trigger a war with China, as Trump said, that doesn't make any sense, that's a half-ass idea.
[00:52:11.379 --> 00:52:12.680]  Why is any of that taking place?
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.983]  They're used to using raw power to discipline people who disagree.
[00:52:16.263 --> 00:52:18.705]  Where Trump used economics to totally crush China.
[00:52:18.825 --> 00:52:20.045]  Exactly, to counterbalance it.
[00:52:20.086 --> 00:52:24.628]  He goes, let's protect American interest and not get into an undue, unnecessary war.
[00:52:24.929 --> 00:52:26.169]  Or trigger one.
[00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:32.834]  Because what Trump understands is that the power of the soul and of freedom and of liberty is the real power of America.
[00:52:33.114 --> 00:52:36.096]  It's not in its military, just as John Kennedy said.
[00:52:36.196 --> 00:52:39.398]  It's not in its military, it's not in its money, it's in its morals.
[00:52:39.438 --> 00:52:42.140]  The truth is the left have become corporate stooges.
[00:52:43.143 --> 00:52:46.104]  And what they don't understand is that they cannot crush the will of the audience.
[00:52:45.923 --> 00:52:50.324]   if they can attack one of the leading populist leaders and bring that down it'll help them.
[00:52:50.324 --> 00:52:52.003]  That war was already lost by them.
[00:52:52.003 --> 00:52:53.003]  Oh completely.
[00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:57.083]   And what they don't understand is that they cannot crush the will of the audience.
[00:52:57.083 --> 00:53:01.563]   They've been trying to escalate and escalate and escalate and escalate, script this trial
[00:53:01.563 --> 00:53:06.364]   to get a rigged outcome in order to be able to suppress independent voices and scare and
[00:53:06.364 --> 00:53:11.643]   terrorize people all across the country from speaking up for freedom or liberty, for standing
[00:53:11.643 --> 00:53:13.204]  up for Infowars or Alex Jones.
[00:53:13.294 --> 00:53:20.396]  And what they don't understand, what they continue to underestimate, is the will and conscience of ordinary, everyday Americans.
[00:53:21.016 --> 00:53:22.656]  Alright Barnes, you've got to catch an airplane.
[00:53:23.077 --> 00:53:24.717]  Tell folks how they find your great podcast.

[00:54:00.705 --> 00:54:03.910]  Whatever you do, thank you for tuning in on this Saturday evening.
[00:54:05.372 --> 00:54:06.273]  Thank you for caring.

[00:54:08.736 --> 00:54:13.002]  Please share this report and tell others to share it and that completes the Shane Reaction.
[00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:16.793]  Tomorrow night, I'll be covering so much here.
[00:54:17.514 --> 00:54:19.416]  And I got a bunch of special guests and so much coming up.
[00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:20.737]  So God bless you all.
[00:54:21.177 --> 00:54:22.198]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:54:22.519 --> 00:54:33.149]  Now share the live feed of this and share the archive of it at Band.Video or roll over and die, which I know you're not going to do, because I'm not going to do it either.
[00:54:33.229 --> 00:54:36.429]  And I pledge to you all, I'm going to redouble my efforts.
[00:54:36.429 --> 00:54:42.068]  [MUSIC]
[00:54:42.068 --> 00:54:46.828]   And if there were ever a case of someone being unfairly railroaded by
[00:54:46.828 --> 00:54:52.068]   the court system, just look at these civil lawsuits against Alex Jones.
[00:54:53.078 --> 00:54:55.499]  It's been nothing short of astonishing.
[00:54:56.279 --> 00:54:58.919]  Alex has been denied the right to testify in his own defense.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:03.240]  His legal team has been denied the right to present evidence in his defense.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.221]  He's been denied the right to call witnesses in his defense.
[00:55:07.429 --> 00:55:12.891]  He was deemed guilty by the judge verbally in front of the jury dozens of times.
[00:55:14.132 --> 00:55:15.272]  And where did that guilt come from?
[00:55:15.292 --> 00:55:19.054]  Oh, it was a default decision by the judge, not a jury.
[00:55:19.954 --> 00:55:21.395]  Alex did not get a jury trial.
[00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:23.676]  He did not get a trial at all.
[00:55:23.896 --> 00:55:25.717]  He got a default judgment.
[00:55:26.567 --> 00:55:32.091]  Because the judge just simply declared, well, we've decided that you're guilty and you don't get a trial.
[00:55:32.111 --> 00:55:39.056]  And then the judge gagged him and said, you can't talk about this and you can't claim that the trial is unfair.
[00:55:39.116 --> 00:55:40.057]  I mean, think about that.
[00:55:40.537 --> 00:55:50.745]  You're getting railroaded and the judge says, you're not allowed to say you're being railroaded because we don't like what you said years ago about Sandy Hook, even though you apologized for it.
[00:55:50.785 --> 00:56:00.405]   And even though you already said you were wrong in that case, even then, We're going to do all of this to you because of what you said about Sandy Hook.
[00:56:01.607 --> 00:56:15.219]  So now in America, if you say that no children died, but actually according to the media, 20 children died, then you can be sued and ordered to pay potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.701]  Because of the pain and suffering of the parents.
[00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:19.823]  So that's why I asked the original question.
[00:56:19.843 --> 00:56:22.825]  Well, what if Alex Jones had said nobody died from vaccines?
[00:56:23.125 --> 00:56:26.647]  How many children in America have died from vaccines so far?
[00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:30.570]  I mean, the COVID vaccines since early 2021, let's say.
[00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:47.367]   There is very credible evidence from multiple scientific studies and statistical analyses that the number of total deaths from COVID vaccines in America, that is excess deaths caused by the vaccines, is at least 1 million people.
[00:56:48.348 --> 00:56:53.051]  And we see the excess deaths in the insurance company statistics as well.
[00:56:53.611 --> 00:56:57.354]  According to some insurance companies, excess deaths are up 20% or 25%.
[00:56:57.754 --> 00:57:00.516]  One company reported 40% for a certain time period.
[00:57:01.337 --> 00:57:02.858]  That's a lot of excess deaths.
[00:57:03.578 --> 00:57:14.306]  Globally, the number of people very likely killed by these vaccines at this point, just by a reasonable rough estimate, must exceed 10 million people.
[00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:16.390]  And it's probably much, much higher.
[00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:22.774]  Now, it doesn't ask the question how many children have been killed by these vaccines, but I can assure you it's more than 20.
[00:57:23.374 --> 00:57:27.537]  Probably a number in the low thousands at this point.
[00:57:28.157 --> 00:57:31.859]  We've also seen lots of young athletes dying.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:44.427]  Athletes in their 20s and 30s dying on soccer fields and football fields, baseball mounds and basketball courts just keeling over and dying and doctors dying while out jogging.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:52.006]  And a whole bunch of doctors at that one hospital in Canada died, all within the span of about 10 days, it seems.
[00:57:53.288 --> 00:57:54.989]  A lot of deaths happening from this.
[00:57:55.049 --> 00:57:57.792]  But what if you had said, no one died from vaccines?
[00:57:59.093 --> 00:58:00.355]  What if Alex Jones had said that?
[00:58:00.395 --> 00:58:01.216]  Could he be sued?
[00:58:03.298 --> 00:58:06.020]  Over the pain and suffering of the parents of the dead children?
[00:58:06.361 --> 00:58:12.310]   Well, according to these court cases, Alex Jones could have been sued if he said no one died from vaccines.
[00:58:13.031 --> 00:58:19.856]  And of course, anyone saying that would be incredibly dishonest, because lots of people have died from these vaccines, and lots of children have died.
[00:58:19.876 --> 00:58:27.121]  And people like Fauci, if you ask them, how many children have been killed by these vaccines, they would tell you, zero.
[00:58:28.122 --> 00:58:30.143]  Walensky at the CDC, she would say zero.
[00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:32.925]  Dr. Birx, she would say zero.
[00:58:32.965 --> 00:58:34.066]  Fauci would say zero.
[00:58:34.186 --> 00:58:34.607]  On and on.
[00:58:35.503 --> 00:58:39.046]  If you ask the White House, some spokesperson would say zero.
[00:58:40.528 --> 00:58:41.469]  Which means they're lying.
[00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:43.010]  They're lying.
[00:58:44.031 --> 00:58:47.194]  The conspiracy theorists are not Alex Jones.
[00:58:47.214 --> 00:58:49.296]  They're the vaccine pushers.
[00:58:50.362 --> 00:59:09.817]  So, I'm wondering if Alex can be sued for tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars, does this set a precedent where the parents of children killed by vaccines can now sue all these other people, say, well, you caused pain and suffering for me by claiming that my child wasn't killed by a vaccine even though they were?
[00:59:10.765 --> 00:59:34.597]  Because if we're going to start holding people accountable in America for claiming that nobody died from fill-in-the-blank, whatever that may be, like nobody died from vaccines, nobody died from antidepressant drugs, or if somebody were to say nobody died from, you know, swimming pool accidents or automobile accidents or what have you, we're gonna have lawsuits flying left and right all over the country.
[00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:37.339]  Because there's all kinds of denialism.
[00:59:37.999 --> 00:59:39.740]  Alex Jones is not a killer.
[00:59:41.192 --> 00:59:50.420]  But those vaccine-pushing, fraudulent, treasonous, anti-human health authorities that are pushing vaccines, they are mass murderers.
[00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:53.383]  They are carrying out genocide.
[00:59:54.804 --> 00:59:59.108]  They are murdering children to protect the profits of the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.720]  And yet Alex Jones has killed no one.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:11.443]  In fact, Alex Jones sells supplements that have helped healthy mothers conceive and give birth to healthy children.
[01:00:11.803 --> 01:00:17.965]  Alex Jones provides products and solutions that promote health and longevity.
[01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:33.185]   He has no doubt saved the lives of countless thousands of children just through good nutrition and Helping to teach parents to avoid deadly vaccines that cause spontaneous abortions and birth defects.
[01:00:34.246 --> 01:00:40.609]  If anything, Alex Jones should be given credit for all the children that he's helped save over the years.
[01:00:40.629 --> 01:00:54.955]  And that doesn't even count his battles against the abortion industry, by the way, or organ harvesting of children, or Alex's battles against child trafficking and pedophilia, child grooming and genital mutilations.
[01:00:55.435 --> 01:00:59.457]  Alex opposes all of those things very strenuously, very vocally.
[01:01:00.217 --> 01:01:21.328]  But isn't it interesting that the same system that is prosecuting Alex, the same court system, the same radical leftists, the radical left-wing judges and attorneys and district courts and so on, isn't it interesting that in nearly every case, they support murdering children in the womb, don't they?
[01:01:21.828 --> 01:01:23.229]  They support baby murder.
[01:01:23.849 --> 01:01:25.410]  They support infanticide.
[01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:27.811]  They support post-birth abortions.
[01:01:28.834 --> 01:01:30.035]  They support child grooming!
[01:01:30.955 --> 01:01:33.916]  They support genital mutilations of children.
[01:01:33.936 --> 01:01:35.917]  They support chemical castrations of children.
[01:01:35.957 --> 01:01:45.241]  So the system that consumes children and routinely harms them tells you that Alex Jones is guilty?
[01:01:46.341 --> 01:01:52.904]  Even though Alex Jones battles on behalf of children in almost every issue that he covers?
[01:01:54.385 --> 01:01:55.025]  What does that tell you?
[01:01:56.988 --> 01:01:57.648]  Here's what it tells me.
[01:01:57.668 --> 01:02:15.157]  The system wants to silence Alex Jones because he is effective at waking people up to the child mutilations, child trafficking, pedophilia, grooming, abortions, child murder, infanticide, everything that the left stands for.
[01:02:16.277 --> 01:02:36.619]   And so they pretend to care about 20 children that they claim died at Sandy Hook, but they don't care about the 200 million children Imagine if Alex Jones wrote a book entitled Nobody Died From Abortion.
[01:02:39.340 --> 01:02:45.723]  Then I guess the parent of every abortion murdered child could file suit, correct?
[01:02:45.783 --> 01:02:49.885]  Except that in many cases those parents wanted to kill their own children.
[01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:55.828]  But Alex has not authored any such book and never would because he is opposed.
[01:02:56.606 --> 01:03:02.686]   to violence against children. And I encourage you to support InfoWars.com and the InfoWars platform
[01:03:02.686 --> 01:03:08.686]   and all the voices that it supports, all the different experts and people and guests and
[01:03:08.686 --> 01:03:14.285]   analysts that are there, just brilliant people like Robert Barnes, the attorney, and Paul Joseph
[01:03:14.285 --> 01:03:20.285]   Watson, and so many others. It's just amazing. And Gerald Cilenti as one of the hosts from time to
[01:03:20.285 --> 01:03:25.965]   time as well. Support their right to exist. Support their right to question the official narratives.
[01:03:26.926 --> 01:03:30.526]   And that's why I help out and fill in hosts from time to time.
[01:03:30.526 --> 01:03:33.526]  time.
[01:03:31.903 --> 01:03:36.608]  I know that Alex fights against violence against children every single day.
[01:03:37.869 --> 01:03:39.031]  And I see it behind the scenes.
[01:03:39.091 --> 01:03:39.972]  I see it in person.
[01:03:41.093 --> 01:03:47.300]  Alex is almost consumed by the idea of protecting children against the raging murderous Democrats.
[01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:49.162]  So I know the truth.
[01:03:50.253 --> 01:03:55.477]  The truth that no one else is allowed to know because the judges silence the truth.
[01:03:55.836 --> 01:03:58.317]  And that's why they want to silence Alex Jones.
[01:03:58.317 --> 01:04:12.317]  [intro]
[01:04:12.317 --> 01:04:16.715]  I've known this guy probably 20 years.
[01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:25.759]  They've had the most courage out there to publish books that nobody else will publish, and they've become one of the most successful publishing houses in North America, if not the world, at Skyhorse Publishing.
[01:04:25.859 --> 01:04:34.368]  And I just want to salute Tony Lyons because this guy is fearless, and I gotta say it, the credit goes to Tony Lyons and his researchers that we're going to mention here.
[01:04:34.568 --> 01:04:38.009]  It's not ghostwritten, it's my recordings, it's my words, it's my clips.
[01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:40.531]  I sent them, but he had lawyers involved, you name it.
[01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:41.571]  They took it next level.
[01:04:41.651 --> 01:04:43.912]  This is how they're doing it, and how to stop them.
[01:04:44.052 --> 01:04:45.913]  I am just, thank you so much, Tony.
[01:04:46.193 --> 01:04:53.916]  How the hell with your team, because you took my recordings, and 20 hours of recordings, and all the stuff I sent you, and all the meetings we had, and you did this.
[01:04:53.976 --> 01:04:54.596]  This is incredible.
[01:04:54.656 --> 01:04:58.278]  You know, this is the most controversial book coming out this year.
[01:04:58.438 --> 01:05:01.019]  There's no question, the most controversial book.
[01:05:01.339 --> 01:05:02.780]  They're going to try to shut it down.
[01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.041]  They don't want you to read this book.
[01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:10.463]  They're afraid of the revelations in this book, and they're going to censor it in every conceivable way.
[01:05:10.963 --> 01:05:19.207]  So, the thing to do now is to buy it right now, push it to the top of the list, so that everybody has to carry it.
[01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:32.172]  That they know that this book is there, that it's not going to go away, that you're not going to go away, that you're a patriot, that you're fighting for what's right, and that we don't deserve censorship in this country.
[01:05:32.672 --> 01:05:38.956]  We have fought and died for freedom in this country, and we need to fight to protect freedom in this country.
[01:05:39.276 --> 01:05:40.757]  And that's what your book is about.
[01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:43.178]  It's about combating the Great Reset.
[01:05:43.559 --> 01:05:45.460]  This is a book that people need to read.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.703]  If they disagree with it, if people disagree with it, they should make an argument against it.
[01:05:50.843 --> 01:05:51.944]  They shouldn't censor it.
[01:05:52.244 --> 01:05:53.705]  They shouldn't de-platform it.
[01:05:54.005 --> 01:05:56.106]  They shouldn't write hit pieces against you.
[01:05:56.485 --> 01:06:02.565]   They should buy The Great Reset and The War for the World by Alex Jones and they should
[01:06:02.565 --> 01:06:07.404]   decide for themselves, people should decide for themselves what they believe and if they
[01:06:07.404 --> 01:06:10.645]  have better arguments, they should make those arguments.
[01:06:10.645 --> 01:06:15.844]   But this is an important book and I highly recommend it and you know, buying it is an
[01:06:15.844 --> 01:06:21.246]   act of rebellion because like I said, they're going to try to shut it down in every conceivable
[01:06:21.502 --> 01:06:28.887]  This is a book that's already got great blurbs by, you know, Tucker Carlson, Mike Adams, Dr. Mercola, lots of people.
[01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:30.668]  I mean, this is an important book.
[01:06:30.768 --> 01:06:39.194]  You know, it's a book that people have to read and think through, and they have to realize that it's not going to be covered in any mainstream newspaper.
[01:06:39.334 --> 01:06:42.476]  It might not be available in, you know, libraries.
[01:06:42.616 --> 01:06:44.757]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson gave it a great quote.
[01:06:44.818 --> 01:06:45.478]  I mean, it's awesome.
[01:06:45.558 --> 01:06:52.000]  Tucker Carlson, you know, said, uh, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence Alex Jones?
[01:06:52.201 --> 01:06:54.301]  Read this book and decide for yourself.
[01:06:54.481 --> 01:06:55.762]  So that's the thing.
[01:06:55.902 --> 01:06:56.642]  Read this book.
[01:06:56.842 --> 01:07:02.961]   Read The Great Reset and decide for yourself whether the things that you, Alex Jones, have
[01:07:02.961 --> 01:07:08.601]   described are really happening and whether we can all get together to fight them, to
[01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:09.642]  fight for freedom.
[01:07:09.642 --> 01:07:11.521]  So this is like a battle cry.
[01:07:11.521 --> 01:07:15.602]   This is a book that people need to read and they need to recognize that a lot of people
[01:07:15.602 --> 01:07:19.282]   are going to come out with hit pieces, with reasons not to read it.
[01:07:19.282 --> 01:07:22.041]  They're going to not address any of the claims in the book.
[01:07:22.374 --> 01:07:24.814]  They're just going to go after you personally, Alex.
[01:07:24.854 --> 01:07:26.014]  They might come after me.
[01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:38.817]  But, you know, the reason that we publish books and the reason that people should read books is to learn something new, is to get out of your own kind of footprints and look at things and really think them through for yourself.
[01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:42.798]  Tony, all I can say is congratulations and gosh, I'm glad I finally...
[01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:44.359]  I've had a lot of other book deals I've turned down.
[01:07:44.419 --> 01:07:49.101]  Thank God I went with you, because what you did, what we did together, is simply groundbreaking.
[01:07:49.201 --> 01:07:52.223]  And I believe if people get behind it, it'll go to number one.
[01:07:52.523 --> 01:07:53.864]  And culturally, that's so important.
