[00:00.000 --> 00:25.840]  you can for a moment about the safety. What have you learned about serious side effects
[00:25.840 --> 00:38.880]  in this vaccine? Do you anticipate or maybe stay up at night thinking about the possibility
[00:38.880 --> 00:42.800]  you're going to have to go back in the lab at some point and come up with something better?
[00:42.800 --> 00:56.880]  Maybe your message we know from the Covid vaccine, very effective, very welcome. The logistics
[00:56.880 --> 01:00.880]  around that vaccine were not straightforward because of the new technology. It's not like
[01:00.880 --> 01:23.600]  we control the world. All rise for the reptilian anthem. Let's get down to business. Oh son of a
[01:23.600 --> 01:46.480]  bitch. That's a little bit of fun from Netflix. I don't think the globalists are reptoids,
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.360]  but if they might as well be soulless, evil creatures that aren't human because they are
[01:51.360 --> 01:56.960]  trying to artificially create life forms and they've been successful that aren't even made
[01:56.960 --> 02:03.520]  out of plant or animal life that are completely synthetic and artificial and that's what the
[02:03.520 --> 02:10.640]  whole Covid so-called 19 injections are. To say that the bottom has fallen out of the whole Covid
[02:10.640 --> 02:16.240]  19 takeover plan is an understatement and the developments every few days top the previous
[02:16.240 --> 02:25.360]  most insane developments. The stack of news over here is mainstream. Oxford University's medical
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.080]  unit has put out a study. There are literally hundreds of other studies showing the same thing
[02:30.800 --> 02:41.520]  that you are 44 times more likely to contract Covid if you've had these shots. So a so-called
[02:41.520 --> 02:46.480]  vaccine that actually makes you contract it and in the other studies you're way more likely to get
[02:46.480 --> 02:51.280]  sick or die. They knew this from the beginning. It was in the documents that came out in October of
[02:51.280 --> 02:57.200]  2000. I just want to leave that here for now. We're going to be coming back to it later. We
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.560]  obviously have the aftermath and the ongoing carnage. Now the tropical storm Ian that was a
[03:02.560 --> 03:07.440]  category five hurricane when it slammed in the sheriff's departments are reporting they expect
[03:07.440 --> 03:12.720]  there to be hundreds of dead. Roger Stone is on the east coast of Florida but his power recently
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.600]  only came back. He'll be reporting from Florida for us coming up in the second hour and covering
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.280]  40 days from the midterms the latest January 6th propaganda and more. I will also open the
[03:25.280 --> 03:33.280]  phones up today in the third hour as we open them up in the second hour yesterday. The images of
[03:33.280 --> 03:40.160]  sharks swimming down the highways and water flooding even to the second floor of some hotels is
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.160]  dramatic and we will be going over all of that and praying for the folks
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.320]  in Florida and then looking at the mainstream corporate enemy of the people media like the view
[03:53.920 --> 03:58.800]  saying that this happened because the sanis was elected. Now if you think that idiocy
[03:58.800 --> 04:08.320]  to not be top Kamala Harris who is not geriatric who does not have the later onset of dementia
[04:09.200 --> 04:17.200]  but is just a complete empty suit puppet has come out and said that the United States shares
[04:17.200 --> 04:22.960]  a very important relationship with an alliance with the Republic of North Korea. We are currently
[04:22.960 --> 04:30.880]  at war with North Korea since the armistice and the ceasefire back in the 1950s but that is a ceasefire.
[04:30.880 --> 04:40.000]  We are at war with North Korea and she says that they are our very important ally in the region
[04:40.720 --> 04:46.960]  North Korea. I mean that's who they want Alzheimer's patients idiots morons pedophiles scum.
[04:47.840 --> 04:52.800]  There's so much more coming up today. Google has censored the new prime minister of Italy
[04:52.800 --> 04:57.360]  speech because it was true so much more coming up.
[05:01.200 --> 05:06.480]  Look around you everything I predicted from the global stone documents from their own admissions
[05:06.480 --> 05:12.240]  is now happening in full wars credibility. My credibility has never been higher and it's because
[05:12.240 --> 05:18.400]  of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly despite the censorship and the boycotts
[05:18.400 --> 05:24.880]  and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air but now we're reaching the most critical juncture in
[05:24.880 --> 05:31.920]  the fight together. So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air. In my decades
[05:31.920 --> 05:36.320]  on air I've never asked for personal donations but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to
[05:36.320 --> 05:42.720]  pay for 40 percent of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself. It's unsustainable so please
[05:42.720 --> 05:49.920]  visit saveemfullwars.com saveemfullwars.com where you can make straight donations five
[05:49.920 --> 05:55.040]  ten fifty hundred dollars whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere. I'll never give up
[05:55.040 --> 05:59.840]  I'll never give in but I could give out. Thank you for your support wouldn't be without you save
[05:59.840 --> 06:17.760]  info wars dot com big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny
[06:17.760 --> 06:26.240]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones what have all military
[06:26.240 --> 06:32.480]  historians and current analysts warned up with this ongoing war with Russia the proxy war now
[06:32.480 --> 06:39.200]  turning into a full-fledged war threatening nuclear war in Ukraine escalation and that's
[06:39.200 --> 06:45.120]  happening on every front now with the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines both confirmed to be
[06:45.120 --> 06:52.160]  attacked in western controlled sectors the Russian government officially saying that NATO in the
[06:52.160 --> 06:58.960]  United States blew up the pipelines and I even had russifobe on Joel Scousen who's a smart guy
[06:58.960 --> 07:06.080]  but he's definitely anti-russian anti-communist russian anti-putin russian he agrees the analysis
[07:06.080 --> 07:12.640]  is clear that biden in the new world order blew up both pipelines and looks like Nord Stream 2
[07:12.640 --> 07:17.120]  they're saying can never be repaired well that will do economically to europe will be beyond
[07:17.120 --> 07:23.520]  devastating it'll be felt here in a big way the ongoing destruction of civilization and human
[07:23.520 --> 07:27.600]  infrastructure they promised you you'll own nothing have nothing and like it they promised
[07:27.600 --> 07:32.720]  you an end of fossil fuels one way or another and biden promised as well as victoria newland the
[07:32.720 --> 07:39.200]  state department to get rid of those pipelines if russia invaded ukraine so what's the next
[07:39.200 --> 07:44.720]  escalation that's a big question everybody should be having but listen we got communist china expanding
[07:44.720 --> 07:51.040]  across the south china sea moving into areas as far south as vietnam and of course the philippines
[07:51.040 --> 07:56.160]  and you've got russia and that huge war that proxy war expanding and we've got open borders and
[07:56.160 --> 08:00.880]  fentanyl being shipped in and human smuggling and devaluation of currencies all this is happening
[08:02.320 --> 08:10.800]  but at least we've got an alliance at least we've got north korea here is the vice president
[08:10.800 --> 08:17.360]  talking about the incredible very important relationship we have and the alliance the united
[08:17.360 --> 08:25.440]  states has with kim jong-un so the united states shares a very important relationship
[08:25.440 --> 08:32.640]  which is an alliance with the republic of north korea and it is an alliance that is strong and
[08:32.640 --> 08:42.960]  enduring that's right and we have a president that from even a month ago looked like he had the the
[08:45.280 --> 08:50.880]  second phase of dementia now is obviously the third and final phase does not know what planet
[08:50.880 --> 08:57.040]  he's on but don't worry he's got control of the nuclear weapons this is where we live this is what's
[08:57.040 --> 09:05.600]  happening and now there are governments in the uk australia germany and now the u.s. government
[09:06.560 --> 09:11.600]  is promising to put bugs in the school children's food oh you don't want to bug as an adult well
[09:11.600 --> 09:15.600]  as a child you'll be made to eat it and the keratin or the shell
[09:15.600 --> 09:27.760]  they're there they're there they're armored shell of the bugs is extremely toxic
[09:29.360 --> 09:34.160]  and extremely bad for you and causes liver failure and bone cancer amongst all the other
[09:34.160 --> 09:39.200]  wonderful things and there's the wash of posts insects a new nutritious ingredient
[09:39.200 --> 09:45.520]  for school lunches and it's being rolled out eat the bugs uk school children fed insects to encourage
[09:45.520 --> 09:50.640]  sustainability it's for the earth we have endorses bugs and insects force-fitted children
[09:50.640 --> 09:55.760]  now happening in a thousand australian public schools lock you in your house make you have a
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.600]  digital id inject you with deadly poison and make you eat the bugs isn't that just sweet gotta get
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.560]  them while they're young and whether you're in australia or the u.s or germany or canada they
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.280]  have drag queen pedophile story time as well where grotesque fat men dressed like clowns have small
[10:11.280 --> 10:19.840]  children sit on their swollen waistlines so that's where we are ladies and gentlemen total
[10:19.840 --> 10:26.640]  dehumanization training us to accept absolute tyranny but humanity is rejecting it if we adapt
[10:26.640 --> 10:31.760]  to the tyranny if we submit to the tyranny if we continue to go into mass Stockholm syndrome
[10:31.760 --> 10:39.520]  and learn helplessness and create a normalcy bias in the oberton window a pedophile story time and
[10:39.520 --> 10:46.480]  open borders and human smuggling and annihilated currencies and needles and feces all over the
[10:46.480 --> 10:54.480]  ground and defunded police and massive crime and war and surveillance and censorship if we put up
[10:54.480 --> 11:00.960]  with that can you imagine what they're normalizing us for dystopia for well you'll own nothing you'll
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.400]  have nothing and you'll like it you live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment you'll be bathed in
[11:06.400 --> 11:13.280]  five and six g radiation you will be killed by this technological metamorphosis of the
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.160]  transhumanist being carried out against the population of earth so let me tell you what's
[11:18.160 --> 11:23.440]  coming up today all the information the latest developments on hurricane ian that is now a
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.840]  tropical storm and has caused massive devastation the fact that the meteorologist said it was going
[11:27.840 --> 11:33.440]  to be a very serious storm it's not hype but it was worse than many expected we'll be tracking that
[11:33.440 --> 11:39.680]  then meanwhile officials say Nord Stream pipeline sabotage Pentagon won't say by who but russia says
[11:39.680 --> 11:47.520]  it was nato and the united states google silences women youtube removes georgia maloney's viral
[11:47.520 --> 11:51.120]  speech about how they want to turn us into commodities and destroy our families we'll
[11:51.120 --> 11:55.120]  be playing the short speech the full speech 14 minutes long i'm going to add it under the
[11:55.120 --> 12:03.760]  live show feed today at info wars dot com uh continuing the massive poison shot known as the
[12:03.760 --> 12:11.440]  covid 19 vaccine news is unbelievably powerful i have more than 15 new studies and mass reports
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.960]  and top scientists going public we're going to be giving you those headlines here's the first one
[12:17.520 --> 12:24.560]  vaccination increases infection risk by 44 oxford study finds we already knew that but it gets worse
[12:24.560 --> 12:28.240]  we're going to be covering that they definitely don't want this information getting out but now
[12:28.240 --> 12:31.440]  they're having to admit it to cover their ass and act like it was a mistake remember in the
[12:32.080 --> 12:40.720]  spars 2025 2028 globalist john hobkins un bill gates document they chronicle set in the year 2020
[12:40.720 --> 12:46.800]  2023 but set in the year 2025 2028 the exact battle plan a year and a half into the shots they then
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.520]  admit they're deadly in a racial immune system and cause cancer and heart attacks that then causes
[12:51.520 --> 12:56.320]  destruction of confidence in government and the system and a further collapse then they hit you
[12:56.320 --> 13:01.280]  with another virus it's all been planned all been blueprinted you ask why would they put it in a
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.080]  battle plan well they call it a drill so they can walk around with an operational attack profile
[13:06.640 --> 13:12.720]  an operational mission planning guide given to their people and they can't get caught or go to
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.800]  jail because oh it's just a drill of the exact same thing happening just in real time not in the
[13:18.800 --> 13:25.600]  future but it's okay the FDA has a new definition of what you can call healthy on a package and
[13:25.600 --> 13:32.960]  guess what it's stuff that's incredibly unhealthy carbohydrates sugar they want the protein and
[13:32.960 --> 13:39.600]  they want the fat cut because all the studies show good clean protein and good clean fat is
[13:39.600 --> 13:45.280]  so good for every cell in your body so good for your arteries so good for your heart it's trans
[13:45.280 --> 13:55.520]  fats artificial fats boiled fats cooked fats that are deadly deadly deadly deadly deadly
[13:55.520 --> 14:02.320]  lean steak is amazingly good lean chicken is incredibly good cooked fish or uncooked fish
[14:02.320 --> 14:09.440]  incredibly good but what is bad there are some things that are so-called natural that are not
[14:09.440 --> 14:16.560]  good let's just say it fast cooked bacon is a ticket to the heart attack it's natural but it's
[14:16.560 --> 14:20.480]  a burned fat you're gonna have bacon better cook it slow and i'm telling myself that i love crispy
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.280]  burned bacon one of my favorites on a sandwich with onions and lettuce and cheese and an egg oh my
[14:25.280 --> 14:30.720]  goodness fried egg sandwich but instead of cooking my bacon in five minutes when i have bacon a few
[14:30.720 --> 14:37.520]  days a week i cook it for 20 it even tastes better just don't be lazy about it but everything else
[14:37.520 --> 14:45.040]  they tell you is a lie yeah you want colon cancer eat well done steaks want to live to 100 eat rare
[14:45.040 --> 14:50.400]  steaks and they know it and they understand it and they're attacking the truth and what's healthy
[14:51.120 --> 14:56.080]  that's all coming i'm getting hungry talking about this and then huge economy economy news
[14:56.080 --> 15:03.200]  economy news the economies are coming huge economic news huge economic news uh this is really
[15:03.200 --> 15:09.040]  important with larry summers the architect of the collapse we're in trying to leave biden holding

[15:13.920 --> 15:20.000]  removed right now but he's a puppet and so he's a minion of obama and larry summers they're now

[20:40.080 --> 20:45.040]  and it shows how we are in a 21st century war and what that is really going to be signifying
[20:45.040 --> 20:50.800]  and meaning that's coming up next segment but first let's get into the hurricane hurricane
[20:50.800 --> 20:59.200]  again it is so disgusting to watch the corporate press in the left from abc with a view to cnn
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.040]  msnbc all of them particularly the public schools brainwashing the children that it's their fault
[21:05.040 --> 21:09.120]  hurricanes are here and that we're having the worst hurricanes ever the truth is we went over
[21:09.120 --> 21:13.600]  the documents and know of the federal government's own numbers that hurricanes last 50 years
[21:14.160 --> 21:18.560]  early 60 years have been declining from what they were previously reported and that's believed to
[21:18.560 --> 21:25.440]  be tied to sunspots the main driver but that said if you are in areas that get hit by hurricanes
[21:25.440 --> 21:30.240]  they're no joke and the sheriff's departments are estimating hundreds of people will be dead
[21:30.240 --> 21:38.800]  the storm surge was as high as 15 feet tall and went into some areas up to a mile to 10 miles
[21:38.800 --> 21:46.800]  into the florida coastline this was an extremely serious situation it's ongoing situation
[21:46.800 --> 21:53.200]  that a lot of heroes that are working on for the power companies and for the fire departments and
[21:53.200 --> 21:58.480]  for law enforcement that are going into this situation and are risking their lives to try
[21:58.480 --> 22:04.320]  to get the power back on and to save people but yes just because you've lived through other
[22:04.320 --> 22:12.320]  hurricanes when the sanice told people in those areas to get out he meant it and folks should
[22:12.320 --> 22:15.920]  have gotten out i know a lot of people are elderly they don't have a place to go a lot of people
[22:15.920 --> 22:19.840]  don't want to go to the nursing home their family doesn't visit them so they're stuck in their house
[22:20.800 --> 22:24.880]  the reports are water got in the second floors and first floors where people live and there's
[22:24.880 --> 22:29.920]  going to be a lot of dead so we need to pray for the survivors and pray for people that have lost
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.400]  family but florida is the fastest growing state it will rebuild storms are just part of the world
[22:36.400 --> 22:40.240]  part of life if you don't have hurricanes because you live inland you have tornadoes
[22:40.240 --> 22:47.840]  and wildfires and so you replace one problem with another the only thing that is constant is change
[22:47.840 --> 22:55.280]  in this universe and in this world hurricane ian updates florida sheriff says fatalities are in the
[22:55.280 --> 23:00.240]  hundreds after monster storm that is now a tropical storm ian becomes tropical storm
[23:00.240 --> 23:06.960]  after catastrophic hurricanes strike hurricane ian batters florida's coast with catastrophic fury
[23:06.960 --> 23:13.360]  people trapped 2.5 million without power as ian drenches florida nine lives good
[23:13.360 --> 23:18.080]  samaritan risk life to rescue cat perched on air conditioner as raging waters from hurricane
[23:18.080 --> 23:25.520]  ian surrounded pretty powerful video on info wars dot com ian's pat lev ruin will be going over
[23:25.520 --> 23:30.560]  that with roger stone next hour governor sannis says hurricane ian is 500 year event has stunned
[23:31.120 --> 23:36.000]  florida residents wake up to utter devastation at bassoon amie style floods killed hundreds
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.480]  as 15 national guard choppers begin search and rescue operations
[23:42.720 --> 23:51.360]  meanwhile piling on to this tragedy of the disgusting lying anti-gun anti-family anti-america
[23:51.360 --> 23:58.880]  anti-free speech harpies at the view and what have they said here's a quote and now his state
[23:58.880 --> 24:03.760]  is getting hit with one of the worst hurricanes the view thinks the hurricane ian is a direct
[24:03.760 --> 24:11.200]  result of governor sannis stance on climate change this is superstition this is voodoo this is
[24:11.200 --> 24:14.960]  idiocy but that's why they've done people down in the school system by design it's in the government
[24:14.960 --> 24:21.520]  documents the last 60 years where large portions of people believe that your cars or your air
[24:21.520 --> 24:29.360]  conditioning caused this storm remember the spanish armada thousands of ships that was going to
[24:29.360 --> 24:38.160]  invade england what was it 400 years ago and what destroyed them an atlantic storm an atlantic
[24:38.800 --> 24:48.720]  hurricane when the chinese had a multi thousand group of ships hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[24:48.720 --> 24:56.400]  of years ago what was it 500 plus years ago about to invade japan with 10 to 1 troops
[24:56.400 --> 25:04.000]  ships a huge storm because they didn't have satellites then a typhoon in the pacific the
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.840]  storms are called typhoons the atlantic are called hurricanes i know most listeners know
[25:07.840 --> 25:14.800]  that in case there's young people tuning in and japan developed the term kamikaze out of that
[25:14.800 --> 25:23.280]  meaning divine wind because almost all the ships were destroyed by the typhoon or the cyclone
[25:23.280 --> 25:31.520]  so we go through history and there are thousands of examples of of navies thousands
[25:32.240 --> 25:35.840]  it's it's been written about more than a hundred times by the greeks hundreds of times by the
[25:35.840 --> 25:39.600]  romans where their enemies were coming to get them or they were going to get somebody and
[25:39.600 --> 25:45.520]  then a storm would come and destroy them or damage their fleet and again i know our listeners
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.560]  get this i'm not insulting your intelligence we have a lot of listeners that don't understand
[25:50.560 --> 25:54.800]  that there's always been storms in fact will you guys punch up storms just go to youtube
[25:56.240 --> 26:03.920]  time lapse of storms on jupiter our storms maximum speed is about 170 miles an hour on earth
[26:05.440 --> 26:12.800]  the storms on jupiter get up to several thousand miles an hour boy you wouldn't want to be in one
[26:12.800 --> 26:20.480]  of those on that gas giant plus the gravity would tear you to pieces so those are gigantic
[26:20.480 --> 26:27.040]  storms on jupiter and they have nothing to do
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.720]  now i know our general listeners know this but when i had one of the heads of the Rothschild
[26:38.720 --> 26:41.760]  dynasty on 15 years ago it's in my film in game a clip of it
[26:44.640 --> 26:48.160]  he was saying he had a children's book out about how polar bears can't swim we
[26:48.160 --> 26:53.040]  now by the year 2017 all the coast will be flooded and the ice caps will be totally melted which
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.640]  wasn't true and i said to him i said well i got articles from nasa and and and and articles
[26:58.640 --> 27:04.720]  out of the discovery channel right here that telescopes show that the ice caps on mars are
[27:04.720 --> 27:15.120]  melting and he said well that's because of the sun and i said i know and he said well because
[27:15.120 --> 27:18.800]  of the sun they're getting bigger and i just said i just said they're getting smaller these people
[27:18.800 --> 27:25.360]  know what they're doing the Rothschild smart but he was thinking my audience was a group of morons
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.440]  so i'm going to show jupiter again you guys found an actual time lapse not just an artist rendering
[27:29.440 --> 27:37.760]  of it now that's a time lapse sped up but those are multi thousand mile an hour gas storms on the
[27:37.760 --> 27:45.920]  surface of the gas giant as you get deeper in it's got a gas core many scientists believe it's an
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.560]  unignited star when there's enough pressure from it they will ignite and you get a sun
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.160]  so the point is that we've always had storms we have storms on this planet we're orbiting a sun
[27:58.160 --> 28:02.400]  the sun is the main driver of climate and i know i'm harping on simple things this sounds
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.280]  ridiculous to regular listeners it's like me telling you two plus two equals four but the general public
[28:07.280 --> 28:10.880]  does not know this well go ahead and play the clip from the view here it is
[28:12.400 --> 28:19.840]  is the quote from governor disantis about climate change quote i am not in the pews of the church
[28:19.840 --> 28:26.240]  of the global warming leftists this is what he thinks about climate change and now his state
[28:26.240 --> 28:31.920]  is getting hit with one of the worst hurricanes that i will ever see perhaps he was right this
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.520]  is a cult of superstition and idiocy whether it was the Aztecs or many other ancient cultures they
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.320]  would tell their people do what we say we human sacrifices or the sun will be eaten by a snake
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.400]  tomorrow they would know the days of the eclipse then when the sun disappeared at high noon people
[28:46.400 --> 28:50.880]  panic and say make it come back they cut some hearts out it would come back and they would then
[28:50.880 --> 28:56.640]  believe that the priests were god it's very simple superstition it's mind control it's stockhome syndrome
[28:56.640 --> 29:04.320]  we'll be right back look around you everything i predicted from the global stone documents
[29:04.320 --> 29:09.440]  from their own admissions is now happening info wars credibility my credibility has never been

[33:25.360 --> 33:30.640]  the third hour roger stone joins us in the second with so much important news and he's in florida
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.640]  we'll talk about the terrible hurricane and the ongoing carnage and aftermath
[33:36.400 --> 33:40.320]  but i want to get to the escalation in ukraine the escalation the baltic sea
[33:40.320 --> 33:46.480]  and other areas i've done a deep dive on this the last three days and we know what happened now
[33:46.480 --> 33:51.360]  and i'm going to be laying out the facts here but i've taken my time to get this straight
[33:52.720 --> 33:56.640]  and the confluence of different things that developed in and around this and the statements
[33:56.640 --> 34:03.600]  by biden victoria newland the u.s navy ship that has submersible submarines with navy seals
[34:03.600 --> 34:12.080]  silt team 10 being in that area in the last month all the things that just unfolded along
[34:12.080 --> 34:17.520]  with the cia's own admissions tell us exactly who did this and there's one other big piece of
[34:17.520 --> 34:29.280]  information that ties into it a massive new gas pipeline get ready for it opened the same day
[34:29.280 --> 34:35.520]  three days ago when Nord Stream 2 blew up
[34:37.920 --> 34:44.480]  Nord Stream 1 also got blown up in a us nato controlled area that's all confirmed
[34:46.400 --> 34:54.640]  did you hear me they opened the new pipeline the day they blew up the russian pipelines
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.880]  and the corporate media is in overdrive saying vladimir putin would do this when it was his
[35:00.880 --> 35:08.240]  leverage over europe and how they're making a large part of the money propping up russia right now
[35:11.120 --> 35:16.160]  norway poland gas pipeline opens a key move to cut dependency on russia
[35:16.160 --> 35:27.200]  yeah absolutely insane it opened on the 27th it was tested on the 26th
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.680]  the pipelines were blown up on the 26th i'm going to say that again
[35:35.600 --> 35:38.800]  it's not just biden saying they take out the pipeline it's not just victoria newland it's
[35:38.800 --> 35:45.920]  not just the navy ship that delivers submersible underwater demolition troops sailors
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.800]  it's not just the timing it's not just who stands to benefit
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.880]  but the day they have the Baltic pipeline inauguration and turn it on
[36:01.600 --> 36:07.200]  is the day the russian pipelines turn off you're going to take one oxygen tank off when you're
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.040]  deep diving you want to have another tank with you that you test and then put in your
[36:11.040 --> 36:18.160]  mouth and then remove the other they literally turned off the russian gas blew it up and then
[36:18.160 --> 36:26.400]  turned on their pipeline i mean wow wow is all i can say and they want the russians to know it
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.800]  while the west sits back and pretends they don't know what happened as a provocation to get the
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.920]  russians to strike back just like the school shootings with men in black uniforms and the attacks
[36:35.920 --> 36:43.760]  on military bases and uh in conscription centers this is just unbelievable here's some of the
[36:43.760 --> 36:48.800]  headlines officials say Nord Stream pipelines sabotage but won't admit who did it Germany
[36:48.800 --> 36:53.920]  believes high explosive devices equivalent to 500 kilograms of tnt used destroyed Nord Stream
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.400]  russia calls u and security council meeting over pipeline flames united states for terrorist attack
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.320]  russia says Nord Stream leaks occurred in zone controlled by u.s intelligence that's Nord Stream
[37:06.320 --> 37:13.200]  one Reuters u.s military official jury still out on Nord Stream pipeline sabotage
[37:16.800 --> 37:25.760]  and it just goes on from there these people think we are complete idiots
[37:25.760 --> 37:29.680]  this white house denies claims of destroying pipeline like they said they would do
[37:32.400 --> 37:35.920]  and now you see russia blew up their own pipeline but not just the
[37:37.440 --> 37:43.760]  norwegian EU pipeline that's right next to it and just open today that's right as you hear that
[37:44.960 --> 37:52.640]  there is the new pipeline that just opened and it runs right along the russian pipeline but that
[37:52.640 --> 38:00.240]  one didn't get bombed and what do you think will happen now the russians send a submarine in to blow
[38:00.240 --> 38:08.560]  up the new pipeline you see russia blew up their own pipeline but not the norway EU pipeline that's
[38:08.560 --> 38:15.840]  right next to it it just opened on the same day 65d undersea chess in fact the subjects being
[38:15.840 --> 38:23.920]  sarcastic and he would know he's enable intelligence the Baltic pipeline from norway to poland opens
[38:23.920 --> 38:33.040]  up the day in the Baltic sea that Nord Stream 2 is blown up right as europe was buckling and about
[38:33.040 --> 38:39.040]  to accept the opening of the already completed pipeline of course who else shut down pipelines
[38:39.040 --> 38:44.320]  here in the us oh joe biden after the keystone pipeline after a decade of building was completed
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.720]  would have lowered all prices massively but sorry would have given us hundreds of thousands of jobs
[38:48.720 --> 38:54.800]  but sorry it's turned off too i bet the russians turned off keystone pipeline hell they say to
[38:54.800 --> 38:59.120]  sanis cause the hurricane that's just as mindless did you know biden didn't turn off the keystone
[38:59.120 --> 39:03.280]  pipeline no no no no because you know a year and a half ago when they wouldn't turn on the power
[39:03.280 --> 39:07.600]  when the feds wouldn't let texas turn up the coal power plants to give us enough power during that
[39:07.600 --> 39:14.960]  blue norther during that solar that that that winter polar vortex did you know that was putin
[39:14.960 --> 39:24.000]  did that yeah here it is Nord Stream 1 the Nord Stream 2 we've got the new eu pipeline and it's
[39:24.000 --> 39:30.720]  just fine ladies and gentlemen in fact here's politico same folks tell you white supremacy is
[39:30.720 --> 39:36.560]  just everywhere and the two men can have a baby everything's pointing to russia us eu officials
[39:36.560 --> 39:41.520]  on edge over pipeline explosions oh they're on edge they're so worried about it
[39:45.840 --> 39:50.800]  and here's an interesting fact sheet because you know that 99 percent of the world's data
[39:51.360 --> 39:56.720]  and communication traffic is shared through undersea cables internet-making email texting
[39:56.720 --> 40:01.600]  what happens if the russians or the chinese start targeting those because the west has clearly
[40:01.600 --> 40:11.200]  started it drew first blood opened the door for that to happen we're gonna be getting more of that
[40:11.200 --> 40:20.480]  today as the broadcast unfolds but that leads me to this stat that out of all of them is the most
[40:20.480 --> 40:27.760]  important yes florida is very important but hundreds dying is not potentially billions dying from
[40:27.760 --> 40:32.320]  nuclear war but it's still very serious but what's even bigger than potential of world war three
[40:32.960 --> 40:38.800]  well that's the biomedical world war three the genocide being carried out through the poison
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.960]  injections and more and next segment we're going to get into again the biggest developments yet
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.640]  two and a half years ago when we first chronicled and forecast all this i told you when this all
[40:52.640 --> 40:56.320]  comes out you will see the biggest news ever about the new world order and they'll try to hide this
[40:56.320 --> 41:00.960]  in plain view and hope it's so shocking the public can't deal with it and so in the last few months
[41:00.960 --> 41:04.880]  every few weeks i'd say this is the biggest news but now it's all coming out into crescendo
[41:05.600 --> 41:10.240]  it's all being brought out to light so now every day it gets topped with the news i wonder what's

[47:34.800 --> 47:48.000]  in this vaccine do you anticipate or maybe stay up at night thinking about the possibility you're
[47:48.000 --> 47:59.920]  going to have to go back in the lab at some point and come up with something better maybe your
[47:59.920 --> 48:06.480]  medicines we know from the covid vaccine very effective very welcome the logistics around
[48:06.480 --> 48:10.880]  that vaccine we're not straightforward because of the new technology it's not like we control the
[48:10.880 --> 48:24.400]  world all rise for the reptilian anthem
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.680]  let's get down to business let's talk about reptoids be sure to follow these dudes and
[48:33.680 --> 48:40.480]  don'ts to avoid a diplomatic incident do offer them a cricket mouse or vole out of your pocket
[48:40.480 --> 48:49.760]  fun fact about voles volate my father don't use loaded phrases like hisy fit or see you later

[48:56.000 --> 49:00.400]  shake it off was about how i shed my skin every thousand years and the song bad blood was about
[49:00.400 --> 49:11.840]  how i drink blood out of my grandma's save some blood for paul rudd i gave you my kidney and it
[49:11.840 --> 49:18.800]  was delicious ragan meet my favorite reptoid zentatives barb schreik and xarthax griswold
[49:18.800 --> 49:25.120]  walton of the reptoid high council good evening your uh lizardness we reptoids have had a great
[49:25.120 --> 49:31.200]  decade thanks to propaganda in the media we have made society more tolerant of our kind
[49:31.200 --> 49:39.280]  from the geico gecko to the shape of water we even got a rule in smash we did it everyone the
[49:39.280 --> 49:44.960]  world temperature is rising the time is coming brethren soon we shall fulfill the prophecy
[49:44.960 --> 49:57.520]  overthrow humanity and become the true rulers of the world son of a bitch having a little fun
[49:57.520 --> 50:00.960]  there no i don't believe the globalists are actually reptoids but they are evil they are
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.920]  anti-human and they are injecting us with poison that mutates our dna and they think they're god
[50:07.760 --> 50:11.440]  all right so let's get really serious now here because this isn't a joke
[50:11.440 --> 50:19.440]  in the pentagon john hopkins developed war game plan put out two years before they
[50:19.440 --> 50:26.400]  launched cuba 19 in late 2019 they put it out in 2017 spars 2023
[50:28.800 --> 50:32.960]  is the real number spars 2020 2023 is when they actually launched the attack
[50:33.680 --> 50:39.520]  but the document's called spars 2025 2028 if you got a band-aid video it's got close to
[50:39.520 --> 50:43.760]  four million views we did a two hour special report going over the entire document or large
[50:43.760 --> 50:50.240]  portions of the entire document and it even has the same tweets put out on the same days
[50:50.240 --> 50:56.720]  that they actually put out in the real world in 2000 and 2001 and it goes into 2003 they just
[50:56.720 --> 51:02.080]  changed the acronyms in the tweets put out by the same agencies so they would have a battle plan
[51:02.080 --> 51:07.280]  of what to say and what to do in real time and so they got caught with the battle plan it wouldn't
[51:07.280 --> 51:12.640]  be a plan for a biological attack on america through the virus and then through the scene
[51:12.640 --> 51:19.520]  it would just be a drill emergency saturday broadcast world shocked by spars 2025 2028
[51:19.520 --> 51:27.280]  document and i'm going to have that reposted to info wars dot com front page under the live show
[51:27.280 --> 51:33.280]  feed today very very important for everybody to get that and to share that because we're living it
[51:33.280 --> 51:39.600]  and it describes how there'd be opposition to the shots and then how about six months
[51:39.600 --> 51:43.760]  in it would start coming out that it actually would give you the disease they describe a
[51:43.760 --> 51:49.760]  covid-like disease respiratory disease out of china and then then describe about a year into it
[51:49.760 --> 51:53.600]  they would start having people from the health services defect and say it was wrong to do
[51:54.400 --> 52:00.080]  and then within two years of releasing the deadly vaccine they would then admit that it was lab
[52:00.080 --> 52:05.520]  grown and they would then admit that it didn't work and that they would remove the heads of
[52:05.520 --> 52:10.240]  big pharma and there'd be a bunch of punishment but that there would then be a biomedical state
[52:10.240 --> 52:15.920]  brought in to basically oversee all of big pharma which is what big pharma wants is to be merged in
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.160]  with the united nations and the world economic forum so they describe the whole process of how
[52:20.160 --> 52:24.320]  they're going to hit us how they're going to kill us and how they're then going to get away with it
[52:25.120 --> 52:29.200]  so think about what's come out in the documents from phyzer the federal court ordered that they
[52:29.200 --> 52:32.880]  knew in the trials it was killing people they said they did it without trials they actually did
[52:32.880 --> 52:38.080]  trials and it killed people killed large numbers of people they then worked with big tech and the
[52:38.080 --> 52:45.200]  white house especially under biden to suppress any opposition to it vaccination increases risk
[52:45.200 --> 52:53.440]  by 44 new oxford study finds wow that's pretty big we told you that two years ago and it increases
[52:53.440 --> 52:59.440]  hospitalization and death remember it was 100 effective then 94 effective then 80 effective then
[52:59.440 --> 53:06.080]  72 effective then 67 effective then 61 effective then 55 effective then 44 effective then 40
[53:06.080 --> 53:11.760]  effective and now it's not effective it gives you covid makes you get sick and in many cases
[53:11.760 --> 53:17.360]  kills you and that's just the early effects here's the new big study associations of bmi with
[53:17.360 --> 53:22.160]  covid 19 vaccine uptake vaccine effectiveness and risk of severe covid 19 outcomes after vaccination
[53:22.160 --> 53:32.160]  england a population-based cohort study by oxford isn't that just interesting got this new report
[53:32.160 --> 53:39.760]  famous pro vaccine doctor suspects phyzer booster shot sent his cancer into overdrive well a year
[53:39.760 --> 53:47.920]  and a half ago in germany where they started the shots like the uk first it was in a major study of
[53:47.920 --> 53:53.840]  pathology and then another major study from one of the top cancer research treatment facilities
[53:53.840 --> 53:58.960]  in germany where they did their own study on cancer patients given the phyzer and Madonna shots
[53:58.960 --> 54:05.440]  and they found whether it was lymphoma cancer or skin cancer or bone cancer or brain cancer or
[54:05.440 --> 54:12.000]  liver cancer it didn't matter it gave explosive acceleration people whose tumors had been removed
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.920]  people's whose tumors weren't growing people that were in complete remission would have
[54:15.920 --> 54:23.280]  explosive in almost every case accelerated growth and death in fact one of the big german
[54:23.280 --> 54:27.120]  studies was being conducted by a doctor who'd formally run the facility on himself
[54:29.360 --> 54:35.440]  and as part of the study he went ahead and took the second shot and it killed him he said in the
[54:35.440 --> 54:39.840]  in the interest of medicine since we push us on the public i'm taking the second dose he was dead
[54:39.840 --> 54:54.400]  a month later unbelievably wicked and it continues now they admit women that are breastfeeding to
[54:54.400 --> 54:58.640]  take the shot pass on the messenger mRNA to the children causing serious health problems
[54:59.760 --> 55:06.720]  there's a new study out hydroxychloroquine blocks SARS-CoV-2 entry into the pathway in the body
[55:06.720 --> 55:10.640]  in mammalian cell cultures but of course they blocked it for the public because they wanted you
[55:10.640 --> 55:19.120]  to die doctor turns against messenger mRNA COVID-19 vaccines calls for global pause very
[55:19.120 --> 55:26.320]  affected scientists and doctor based in maryland let's play a short clip of dr asim
[55:26.880 --> 55:31.760]  malhotra breaks down being double jab he says we need to suspend these shots now
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.600]  now double jabbed and being one of the first to take the Pfizer vaccine
[55:38.960 --> 55:45.680]  i have after several months critically appraising the data speaking to eminent scientists in
[55:45.680 --> 55:50.880]  oxford stanford and harvard speaking to two investigative medical journalists and being
[55:50.880 --> 56:01.120]  contacted by two Pfizer whistleblowers reluctantly concluded that this vaccine is not completely safe
[56:02.160 --> 56:10.160]  and has unprecedented harms which leads me to conclude that it needs to be suspended until
[56:10.160 --> 56:17.200]  all the raw data has been released for independent analysis now what does the spars 2025 2028
[56:17.200 --> 56:22.160]  document say go read it for yourself it's it's online john hopkins rockfeller foundation you
[56:22.160 --> 56:27.600]  name it what does it say it says within two years the public will discover it's erasing
[56:27.600 --> 56:33.280]  your immune system giving a microcarditis cancer infertility then all these scientists will come
[56:33.280 --> 56:38.080]  out against it but that won't matter because the public would have already found out it doesn't
[56:38.080 --> 56:43.520]  work and hurts them so we'll bring it out we estimate within two years that it doesn't help
[56:43.520 --> 56:49.440]  you and hurt you after we've already hit as many people as we can so remember what we showed you
[56:49.440 --> 56:53.360]  last week from the un zone international numbers in the western world where they've taken us
[56:53.360 --> 57:00.720]  Pfizer and Moderna shots 99 plus percent reduction in taking the shots no one's taking it almost no
[57:00.720 --> 57:07.840]  one's buying it less than one percent of just Stockholm syndrome brainwashed slaves are unbelievable
[57:07.840 --> 57:15.680]  and now oh they can tell you sorry we did this to you you know why would they do this because
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.840]  they're just normalizing killing you just like bear giving tens of millions of people hiv and
[57:19.840 --> 57:24.720]  hepatitis knowingly putting hepatitis and hiv in their factor eight product on record mainstream
[57:24.720 --> 57:30.080]  ish vioxx knew it would kill tens of millions of people it killed two million the us alone
[57:31.680 --> 57:36.880]  they try to say it killed 500 000 or you know the earlier numbers were 60 000 no it's it's
[57:36.880 --> 57:43.680]  two million heart attacks young people vioxx they knew and they did it the company developed oxy
[57:43.680 --> 57:46.960]  cotton had it in their own documents when they developed 20 years ago that would make everybody

[1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:23.520]  from the front lines from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones we're taking
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:28.640]  you live before the roger stone next segment january 6 40 days out from the midterms it's gonna
[1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:35.120]  be a jam packed transmit the north stream pipelines both blown up escalations are massive we are the
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:52.480]  tip of the spear after europe approved the covet vaccine for kids excessive deaths among children
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:01:04.080]  increased by 755 percent recent studies now prove that the covet vaccines are being transmitted to
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:14.560]  children through the vaccinated mother's breast milk a recent harvard study shows that the covet
[1:01:14.560 --> 1:01:26.080]  vaccines are far more dangerous than covet 19 itself and the cdc has quietly acknowledged all this
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:35.920]  all of these facts were once explicitly labeled false by the mainstream narrative the awakening
[1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:42.720]  masses are now aware that these experimental vaccines are deadly and that we are all being
[1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:49.600]  lied to but we still don't know what these mysterious poisons are doing to our bodies
[1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:56.880]  macroscopic research has shown us that some of these vaccines contain graphene oxide and what
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:07.760]  appears to be self-assembling nanotech morticians have found massive inorganic so-called clots growing
[1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:15.840]  inside the vascular systems of the deceased vaccinated and the fda has been using transhumanist
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:24.320]  slogans to push the latest covet booster shots so it isn't surprising that people are now questioning
[1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:30.240]  the vaccine when it comes to a strange new phenomena being captured by security cameras
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:39.040]  from around the world several videos show people suffering from the same strange attack first they
[1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.560]  act as if they see something over their shoulder compelling them to turn their head as the head
[1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:52.560]  turns the body follows an arm lifts as if to point at what they are seeing their body then spirals
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:03:22.080]  into collapse and begins to spasm turning their head to see something and then spinning
[1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:35.600]  into collapse
[1:03:52.720 --> 1:04:00.480]  these videos do not appear to be a hoax and if they are not a hoax then what is this oh they're real
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:09.280]  it has people speculating about 5g
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:20.800]  and has others thinking about cern
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:32.320]  whatever it is that is going on we are still injecting this deadly poison into the young
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:41.840]  bodies of our innocent children reporting for info wars this is greg reese
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:48.480]  roger stone is loaded for bear start your engines get ready our two three and four are straight ahead

[1:04:55.600 --> 1:05:03.920]  look around you everything i predicted from the globlestone documents from their own admissions
[1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:09.360]  is now happening info wars credibility my credibility has never been higher and it's
[1:05:09.360 --> 1:05:14.880]  because of your backing of this operation that i could steadfastly despite the censorship and the
[1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:21.040]  boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits stay on air but now we're reaching the most critical
[1:05:21.040 --> 1:05:27.760]  juncture in the fight together so i want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air
[1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:33.120]  in my decades on air i've never asked for personal donations but i'm being forced by the bankruptcy
[1:05:33.120 --> 1:05:39.120]  court to pay for 40 percent of the legal fees and i can't fund those myself it's unsustainable
[1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:46.400]  so please visit save info wars dot com save info wars dot com where you can make straight
[1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:51.760]  donations five ten fifty hundred dollars whatever you can so that i can continue to persevere i'll

[1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:18.800]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:27.920]  coming up in a few minutes i'm going to show you a graphic that's been on cnbc
[1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:34.880]  nbc abc it's based on the same graphic showing roger stone at the heart of a criminal
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:41.360]  conspiracy and spokes going on from roger all these different things that are happening in america
[1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:47.280]  they are zeroing in on roger and january six trying to outlaw their political opposition
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:52.160]  they admit they're doing it for a month after that blood red speech that biden gave so some
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:56.640]  of you may not care about roger i think most of you do but he's certainly a canary in the coal
[1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:01.360]  mine or a eagle in the coal mine and what happens to him is going to happen to us next it's like
[1:07:01.360 --> 1:07:06.800]  info wars is a canary and you know i try to not talk about the sandy hook show trial
[1:07:06.800 --> 1:07:16.160]  two happening in connecticut three weeks of parents of dead children saying i never said
[1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.360]  their names don't even know who they are but talking about their children and how they died
[1:07:19.360 --> 1:07:26.720]  and how it's my fault i mean it is it is total weaponization and then i'm not even allowed
[1:07:27.280 --> 1:07:34.320]  to give answers other than yes no or i don't know or i get sanctioned and i'll be back there next week
[1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:39.680]  because i'm basically our only witness they don't they've precluded any other witnesses for me
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:47.120]  in a rig trial that shows how deep america is in this tyranny and look this is about all of us
[1:07:47.120 --> 1:07:51.200]  it's bigger than alex jones or donald trump or roger stone or ronda sanis or tucker carlsson
[1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:57.680]  i know roger i've known roger eight nine years so many like almost 10 years ago at a jfk event
[1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:04.560]  in dallas but i've been good friends with him for about seven and a half years and i know roger
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:12.480]  wasn't involved in january 6 because i basically begged him to come and he didn't want to go
[1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:21.360]  he was busy taking care of a sick wife and i bludgeoned him into going and now they're saying
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:28.160]  he's the mastermind of january 6 it is pathetic and it's weird because the way fate works and the
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:35.200]  way history repeats or rhymes i'm the one and i'm not bragging it's not like oh i'm the big shot
[1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:40.880]  talk show host roger wanted a job here a year and a half before the election right through the
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.160]  election i didn't give him a job to laugh at the election he did a great job of the war with oan
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:49.360]  so he got indicted i'm just giving you inside baseball roger said i want to come to work at
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:53.600]  inforce and i said you're a great talk show host you're a great guy but i said i want you to get me
[1:08:54.320 --> 1:09:00.800]  julie and assange on the show he got trump on and i said get me julie and assange and you've got
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:05.200]  the show he came back and said well i'm talking to a talk show host in new york to nosy randy
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:10.000]  critico he says maybe he can get him on but i don't have any contact with with assange but i hear
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:13.360]  from critico which critico gave interviews saying this it's going to be big and then
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:20.160]  and people like assange went on handy and other shows and you know before he was put in solitary
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:25.920]  confinement and said it's going to be big it deals with hillary so he was indicted for supposedly
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:33.840]  lying about it in contact with julie and assange when he never said he had that he had sources
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:38.960]  that were talking to him so i don't want to go over ancient history here but russia gate was a fraud
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:45.280]  but all of this was a fraud but they keep coming after us because if they can label him a domestic
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:50.080]  terrorist they can label all of us that so next break i've got to send to the crew i'll send the
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:54.720]  graphics we can show it but but roger will will cover the hurricane and what's happening there
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:59.200]  your power just came back on incredible we're we're praying for everybody there this is doing a great
[1:09:59.200 --> 1:10:04.160]  job overall i think we'll get into the election in 40 days and so much more but first let's talk about
[1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:10.640]  part two of the january 6 hearings and the how they've zeroed in on you as the kingpin with zero
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:17.200]  evidence uh alex uh it's they're obsessed with me it's an absurdity but this is the way the world
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:25.680]  works uh an idea reaches critical mass on twitter no matter how false or unsubstantiated uh and it
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:30.560]  becomes uh you know it's kind of like russian collusion the russian intelligence assisted in
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:38.080]  the election of donald trump false so in this case uh they are claiming even though you know
[1:10:38.080 --> 1:10:44.880]  otherwise um that i have some involvement either in the illegal actions in the capital on january 6
[1:10:44.880 --> 1:10:52.480]  or even in the efforts to delay the uh certification of the electors um and of course neither one of
[1:10:52.480 --> 1:11:00.080]  those are true they take a video shot in july during the uh in tifa blm riots they claim it
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:07.600]  was shot the day before january 6 false uh these videos based on what i can tell manipulated
[1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:13.760]  selectively edited but they don't prove anything in fact the washington post reported that the videos
[1:11:13.760 --> 1:11:20.800]  released by these two danish left-wing filmmakers actually exonerate me proved that i uh wasn't
[1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:28.800]  at the capital or at the ellipse and i know nothing about it uh but uh again i was smart enough to
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:35.200]  foresee that a politicized justice department would come back later uh and take anyone who
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:42.080]  expressed their first amendment constitutionally guaranteed right to question the uh the uh
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:47.520]  honesty and integrity of the elections and call it a crime so yes i did suggest that the president
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:55.120]  should pardon anybody who did that uh i did not think we should have waited until the election
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:12:01.040]  to deal with the ntifa blm riots for by the way you said that on my show that the military should
[1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:05.120]  be called out and them shooting police and innocent citizens and burning down two plus
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:09.360]  billion dollars and mostly peaceful protest should have been crushed you said that everywhere so
[1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:14.480]  they're taking stuff years before january 6 and acting like you said it on the eve of it
[1:12:14.480 --> 1:12:21.680]  just like adam ship was done before editing text messages and emails look there there is no there
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:30.560]  there uh they previously claimed general flinn and i briefed uh uh uh mark meadows the president's
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:35.920]  chief of staff that never happened they claimed we were to meet in some war room at the willard
[1:12:35.920 --> 1:12:42.320]  i don't not aware of any war room at the willard all of that was perjury's testimony by this woman
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:50.960]  cassidy hudgeson never actually happened uh any claim uh ins insinuation or accusation that i knew
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:57.760]  in advance about was involved in or condone any illegal action on january 6 is just false and there
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:04.720]  is in fact no email no text message no phone number no video footage no witness who can claim
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:09.040]  at other ones absolutely so why are they zeroing in on you and what is the next phase of
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:13.600]  january 6 as our audience knows it was a setup they're sick of hearing about it but the globalists
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.240]  are building their whole domestic takeover plan their blood red speech or declaration of war
[1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:24.400]  against their political opposition on this that's why it's so important it's bloodlust alex uh they
[1:13:24.400 --> 1:13:30.400]  can't get over the fact that i escaped their last frame job and that uh through the grace of god
[1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:39.840]  i escaped the deadly snare set for me by uh eric swalwell uh and uh and uh adam schiff and robert
[1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:46.320]  muller and they take it up on my hate object on the american left uh this puts my family in danger
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:54.800]  puts me in in danger uh and the the torrent the tsunami of fake news uh in the last 24 hours is
[1:13:54.800 --> 1:14:00.560]  is uh is really extraordinary it's extraordinary it's fake and i understand when the committee comes
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:06.640]  back jamey raskin you're familiar with him he's the congressman who failed to report the multimillion
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:12.720]  dollar stock trade on his uh on his disclosure forms um he's already hinted that the next hearing
[1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:18.880]  will be focused at may of my lawyers and i will be prepared he didn't hand he said it he said it he
[1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:26.320]  he said it is well it's a teaser i guess it's a teaser uh look uh this is uh you know the real
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:33.760]  get the real crime here alex i won't shut up i won't stop coming on info wars i won't stop doing
[1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:41.040]  my show at frankspeech dot com every day at five o'clock i won't stop criticizing the globalist
[1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:48.080]  i won't just lay down and go away i'm continuing to fight in the fight for freedom it's very expensive
[1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.840]  as you know uh from both a personal point of view and a financial point of view but i'm not giving
[1:14:53.840 --> 1:15:00.000]  up on america and those who want to help me can go to sone defense fund dot com because as you know

[1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:18.480]  we're all basically competing i guess for the top slot not on purpose but it's true if they can do
[1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:23.440]  that others will be scared to stand up that's why we are standards like a roman standard in a war
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:28.000]  that's got to be protected seriously i mean folks need to understand we're objects of their hate
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:33.920]  because we carry the light of victory in our hearts and souls roger stone stay there i want to shift

[1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:15.840]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:15.840 --> 1:20:29.760]  well when kamala harris isn't announcing the north korea is our greatest ally in the pacific
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:36.480]  that she did that we played at first hour she's saying climate change has caused the hurricane
[1:20:36.480 --> 1:20:41.840]  even though hurricanes are at historic lows this is a big whopper statistically they're way down
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:46.880]  on hurricane in slammed in as a category five hundreds have been killed they're trying to get
[1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:50.880]  the actual numbers a lot of valiant folks so they're saving people the police the fire departments
[1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:56.000]  the military volunteers and rogers even on the east coast of florida has his power went out last
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:02.720]  night until this morning storm surge up to 12 to 15 feet went in up to 10 miles inland in some
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:09.520]  areas on average about a mile very very serious situation ladies and gentlemen and so i wanted
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:16.400]  to get rogers take on this and his response to the view saying governor de santis not supporting
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:21.840]  carbon taxes that it's his fault he's been in office two years and it's governor de santis's
[1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:28.400]  fault roger these people are truly sick governor de santis has done an excellent job in terms of
[1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:35.760]  not only keeping the public informed but also in the preparations uh and now uh the uh the
[1:21:35.760 --> 1:21:44.080]  remediation efforts for this hurricane some of the the images you see are really truly horrific
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:49.440]  as you know alec you never know until the last minute exactly where one of these things is going
[1:21:49.440 --> 1:21:56.320]  to reach landfall i've lived through two of them since i've lived uh in florida i think the governor
[1:21:56.320 --> 1:22:02.160]  has done an excellent job in terms of keeping people informed moving the state resources
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:09.040]  quickly and adroitly to bring relief and in some cases life-saving efforts to florida it's
[1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:15.360]  it is outrageous to say this has anything to do with climate change i do want to go back to
[1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:21.200]  something you said because you sent this to me alice the folks at msnbc yesterday accused me of
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:30.880]  insurrection murder conspiracy obstruction of congress money laundering promulgation of fake
[1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:39.680]  electors felony murder uh fundraising fraud seems to me that they left out the kidnapping of the
[1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:45.680]  linberg baby uh and the assassination of abraham lincoln i mean this is an absurdity i'm not involved
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:52.480]  in any of those things there is no evidence to the contrary roger i apologize i had folks talking
[1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:57.440]  to me during the break and i forgot to send this to the crew this is msnbc and they have you right
[1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:02.720]  in the middle of a conspiracy here with spokes that go off that accuse you of all these incredible
[1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:09.280]  crimes if this isn't defamation i don't know what is well and looking at that list i don't i didn't
[1:23:09.280 --> 1:23:17.120]  have contact with uh anybody on that list other than general flin uh during that time period uh or
[1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:22.400]  even prior to that time period and i know general flin was not involved in and it says you carried
[1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:28.000]  out insurrection witness tampering murder conspiracy voting system fraud obstruction of
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:34.800]  congress money laundering fake electors uh insurrection felony murder fundraising fraud
[1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:40.000]  fundraising fraud and witness tampering so you are and you're number two under trump you're like
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:45.440]  i'm kind of jealous i'm on this list it's amazing that you're not on the list because you didn't
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:52.160]  do anything wrong either uh no it's it's an obsession it's kind of interesting uh back in
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:59.440]  2000 you recall when the bush gore election was up in the air was not publicly clear who had won
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:06.640]  james a baker the third a texan later secretary of state at that time managing the bush uh efforts
[1:24:06.640 --> 1:24:12.640]  urged george w bush to claim victory it was a crucial political decision al gore should have
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:18.160]  done it he didn't george w bush did do it uh possession in the public eye being nine tenths
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:24.640]  of the law when i said that trump should do the same thing months ahead if there was a disputed
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:32.080]  result well i'm accused of criminal activity so baker is hailed as a genius but when i recall
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:37.200]  that historical precedent and i say bush should do the same thing well that's a that that's a
[1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:42.480]  illegal no it is not it's just straight political analysis that's right and now miss mcconnell's
[1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:46.240]  trying to pass the law with jucky schumer not to allow challenging elections that sounds like
[1:24:46.240 --> 1:24:53.200]  venezuela uh it really does everybody has a first amendment right to question the anomalies
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:57.920]  and the irregularities in the election and i foresaw that the democrats would try to
[1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:04.720]  criminalize constitutionally guaranteed first amendment speech about the outcome of the election
[1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:10.640]  so yes i did suggest that all those members of congress none of whom i spoke to uh who had stood
[1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:15.920]  up and challenged the election should be given a pardon i i i also included any other person
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:20.880]  who came forward including myself yes i did say that roger we know you're innocent of this you're
[1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:24.960]  only guilty being an american patriot but their continued obsession with january 6 them saying
[1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:28.880]  there's gonna be imminent terror attacks carried out by patriots i believe we're entering false
[1:25:28.880 --> 1:25:34.000]  flag territory in the next 40 days what tricks could they pull the next 40 days ahead of the midterms
[1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:39.600]  the biggest one i'm most worried about is world war three uh that's what i think we're
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:45.840]  inching our way towards i mean joe biden says that he can blow up this russian pipeline months ago
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:51.440]  and now suddenly the pipeline has been blown up i find that deeply troubling we're inching closer
[1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:58.320]  and closer and closer to world war three and that would certainly have an effect on an upcoming
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:05.120]  election the most recent polls that i've seen that i trust still show that the republicans
[1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:11.760]  continue to maintain an edge and as of today and again this is over a month ago but as of today i
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:18.560]  think are still likely to win the house but then i saw a very compelling interview with matt gates
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:24.000]  yesterday who said that even if the republicans do win the house he doesn't believe that the
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:30.480]  leadership has the belly to question the corruption or the politicization of any of our intelligence
[1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:36.880]  agencies well that's what you've always said unless we have a major cohort or a new big powerful
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:43.520]  matt gates mtg uh coalition in the house that could swing votes either way it'll be a parent
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:48.640]  victory to get republicans in control of the congress i totally agree with that and therefore
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:55.040]  we have to see if the republicans do hold on to that uh do and control the house how is how big
[1:26:55.040 --> 1:27:02.480]  or small is the margin that will be the question uh patriots like gates and marjorie taylor green
[1:27:02.480 --> 1:27:08.640]  and lauren bober and others will have greater leverage the smaller the margin if there's a
[1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:14.480]  blowout which i think is unlikely well then you're going to have to a go along to get along republican
[1:27:14.480 --> 1:27:20.720]  majority i don't think the direction of the country uh will be changed there's enough information
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:27.520]  in the hunter biden laptops uh to promulgate uh articles of impeachment against joe biden
[1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:32.560]  there's certainly enough regarding his dereliction of duty on our southern border but it does not
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:37.760]  appear to me that the republican leadership that is poised to take control if they win
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:45.200]  have the belly for that so what do we do well let's let's get through this election first
[1:27:45.200 --> 1:27:52.240]  in politics a week is a lifetime it's vitally important that that people support those true
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:58.560]  America first candidates do not give money to the party committees they will not spend your money well
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:05.760]  give money to individual candidates for congress and the senate uh that you believe will support
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.760]  america first over the orders and by the way let me just back what you're saying all the big
[1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:13.520]  billionaires whether they give money to good guys or bad guys they never give it to the committees
[1:28:13.520 --> 1:28:18.240]  they never give it to those big grips they give it to individual candidates we should all do the
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:25.520]  same absolutely all right roger i want to shift gears when we come back and i want to talk about
[1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:33.520]  big picture culture wars and what you think the deep state's going to do regardless of who wins
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.240]  this upcoming election this is really important because they're they're they're casting everything
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:42.560]  they're scripting and all there's about to be this imminent civil war but the right wing's not
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:47.360]  planning that so what do you think they're gonna pull not just war with russia but clearly january
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:53.360]  six is so central because they're branding and casting all conservatives as terrorists
[1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:03.360]  look around you everything i predicted from the globlestone documents from their own admissions

[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:29.280]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:36.480]  now we already talked about january 6 and roger went into his innocence and that's important
[1:33:36.480 --> 1:33:40.800]  but we all know that i want to explain to listeners i know most of you get this but i think you
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:46.320]  drill this in here you have a real sense of doom a real sense of horror here
[1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:52.960]  with all the pre-programming we're seeing that prompt supporters american patriots populist
[1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:57.360]  or terrorist and the fbi sing terror attacks are in a minute with 40 days left that they're getting
[1:33:57.360 --> 1:34:01.040]  ready to pull something we'll talk about that with roger stone here in a moment but first
[1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:08.720]  ladies and gentlemen the historic battle for america and the world is happening now and the
[1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:13.040]  globalists hate this show because they hate you they hate this is a focal point not just of my
[1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:18.480]  analysis not just of our guests but the callers and the stories and the reports and the documentaries
[1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:26.560]  and everything we do is leading the very front lines the tip of the spear the intellectual
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:31.040]  brain trust of the resistance look how my book the great reset in the war for the world last
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.640]  month off of that has been number one and that's great but it'll be months and months and months
[1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:42.240]  till i get paid for those royalties that i need to keep info wars on the air we're in bankruptcy
[1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:48.240]  right now chapter five need to be profitable to come out of this and then the democrats that
[1:34:48.240 --> 1:34:55.600]  have said in both show trials that their goal is to silence me won't work because then the company
[1:34:55.600 --> 1:35:01.120]  will continue on and then quote any extra profits will go to them well there's not a lot of extra
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:06.080]  profits around here so they want to shut down they don't want money i'm going to appeal these

[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:14.240]  all right roger stone getting back to what i was saying we know you're innocent january 6 i was there
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.600]  we know that but the obsession the drive the branding of america people's terrorists the blood
[1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:24.560]  red speech finally the mainstream media even gets it finally mainstream conservatives get it
[1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:29.440]  this is an attempt to outlaw their political opposition and war with rush is not enough to do
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:34.000]  that how do you see them getting that what do you see them pulling and i think they're gonna
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:40.080]  pull a false flag or a provocateur at action will it be before the election the next 40 days
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.080]  or will it be after or am i wrong roger look into that crystal ball you're one of the top
[1:37:44.080 --> 1:37:49.200]  political analysts out there well first of all alex let me say last night i finally finished
[1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:55.040]  your book the great reset candidly i'd only skimmed it previously when i agreed to give a blurb
[1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:00.160]  for the dust jacket and i liked it when i looked at it before but i finished it last night and i
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:05.840]  strongly recommend this to everybody out there if you want to know what's really going on in the
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:13.520]  country and the world today it's all in this book this is it's historic get the signed version
[1:38:13.520 --> 1:38:17.840]  because it's something you're going to pass on to your children and they're going to pass on
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:25.120]  to their children it really blew me away it's so succinct and so good alex i i see a number of
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:32.800]  things first of all i see the continued ratcheting down of the censorship in the cancellation you see
[1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:39.920]  you can't stampede the people with a tsunami of fake news if they have an alternative platform
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:47.760]  from which to defend themselves uh and the censorship here uh has uh on the public channels has never
[1:38:47.760 --> 1:38:54.960]  been worse but i worry about the day that info wars dot com or stone zone dot com that those
[1:38:54.960 --> 1:39:01.520]  domains can be taken away from us and there is unfortunately a way to do that so i think they
[1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:09.440]  will ratchet down the censorship and the cancellation even further secondarily i clearly see an effort
[1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:17.600]  to criminalize what has here to forebind constitutionally guaranteed political activity
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:25.280]  and political free speech the democrats wanted to sue the republicans uh for raising the question
[1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:30.640]  of the integrity of the elections in their fundraising that's using the judicial process
[1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:38.320]  against your political enemies additionally i see them framing and charging the leaders of the
[1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:44.160]  conservative movement we've already seen this before i think we could potentially see it again
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:54.400]  to take the leaders out of the the line of fire i also see the uh the continuing soft on crime
[1:39:54.400 --> 1:40:00.720]  policies that we're seeing across the board new york's governor's race is close today
[1:40:00.720 --> 1:40:07.520]  which is incredible that's because the bail reform laws put in place there are essentially
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:14.960]  providing a turnstile justice system which puts dangerous criminals back out on the streets you
[1:40:14.960 --> 1:40:22.080]  can look for soros funded prosecutors and legislators to push these kinds of soft on crime rules
[1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:29.920]  across the country uh what's going to happen between now and the election uh again i i feared a
[1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:37.360]  pandemic some kind of secondary pandemic the monkey pox thing appears to have fallen flat
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:42.400]  there's no evidence i totally agree they tried a second lockdown buildup but nobody bought it so
[1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:47.280]  that that's the good news so now they're gonna pull something else i think that's true we also
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:54.400]  have not seen election reform in enough states so while the news out of wisconsin is very good
[1:40:55.120 --> 1:41:02.400]  based on cleaning up the election laws there to have a free fair honest transparent election
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:08.560]  you still have mail-in ballots in pennsylvania where you have crucial governor and us senate races
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:15.680]  and i think mail-in ballots uh are an open invitation for fraud i agree with you roger
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:20.240]  pulling back from this though i wanted to do the next segment on trump and all these criminal
[1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:24.400]  investigations they've got going falling on their face but they keep doubling down but the next
[1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:30.800]  minute and a half towards break what are other wild cards in this election that that that that
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:36.000]  people don't know about well i think you just put your finger on the most important one they want
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:42.640]  this election to be a referendum on trump uh and to a lesser extent a referendum on uh
[1:41:42.640 --> 1:41:49.200]  governor disantis who i think exposed their hypocrisy by sending illegal immigrants that
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:55.920]  they've been flying into florida uh to uh to martha's vineyard so they would like this to be about
[1:41:55.920 --> 1:42:02.720]  the opposition they would not like this election to be about their record gas prices food prices
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:08.400]  inflation impending world war they don't want to talk about any of those things they want to make
[1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:15.760]  this election about us well i mean the the numbers i see show landslides of republicans the question
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:21.280]  is are they going to stop the election from like you said other than wisconsin the same game is in
[1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:28.480]  play right now uh i think one of the most dangerous things here is overconfidence people who say oh
[1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:32.880]  the republicans are going to win big therefore i don't need to bother to vote or they need no
[1:42:32.880 --> 1:42:38.160]  need to bother everyone in my family and in my circle out overconfidence is one of the greatest
[1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:45.200]  single dangers going into these elections nothing is done it's still over a month away voting and
[1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:51.200]  voting in person on election day will be absolutely one trillion percent agree and let's talk about
[1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:55.440]  your prediction of the 2020 election that turned out to be right when we come back
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:06.160]  i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist i have come from nowhere
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.880]  to the very heights of politics not just in america but the world we are engaging the globalist
[1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:19.120]  at point blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit yes i've persevered
[1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:25.120]  but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you've had the success we're

[1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:16.960]  i got down on my knees
[1:47:28.160 --> 1:47:31.440]  by the way roger's always been a christian but not a bible sucker
[1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:37.760]  and god always uses imperfect people that's who god rises up except in the case of christ
[1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:42.880]  who's perfect for birth let me tell you roger has done some serious christian lecturing to me
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:47.440]  he has he he he's the real deal call me up at five a.m. tell me about jesus
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:51.760]  or i'll be sitting there in a steakhouse living for and i'm going to look at that waitress my god
[1:47:51.760 --> 1:47:55.920]  and i'm married and it's okay i mean i don't cheat on my wife he's like stop that we don't do that
[1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:01.280]  now god doesn't know it's like it's real so roger stone is i mean i'm being admitting i'm kind of a
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:06.880]  devil sometimes i can't help myself it just slips out but roger is on the on the straight
[1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.520]  and narrow and roger you look healthier you look younger than when i first knew you it's like christ
[1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:14.960]  has really empowered you i didn't mean to come back and bring that up i didn't tell you i'd bring it
[1:48:14.960 --> 1:48:21.280]  up but when the media makes fun of you you you in the lion's den you in the fiery furnace you had a
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:26.320]  real conversion people shouldn't make fun of that the left should experience it and cry out to jesus
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:32.240]  and say god of your will show me and you did that and god showed you well i've experienced four
[1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:38.720]  miracles in my lifetime alex in very short order first of all of course the commutation of my sentence
[1:48:38.720 --> 1:48:43.920]  when uh they wanted to send me to a dank georgia president die of course you had your conversion
[1:48:43.920 --> 1:48:49.680]  before that spend a few minutes on this no i know i did because i realized at a certain point uh
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:52.720]  that i explained i don't mean to interrupt i'm gonna shut up but you could i know the story
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:56.480]  i won't you tell it you you've told me this a bunch of person start crying at dinner i mean this is
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:01.520]  real folks how you called out and then magically you said the way came off you you were confident
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:06.880]  suddenly and everything changed i don't want to tell your story but take your time uh alex everything
[1:49:06.880 --> 1:49:13.440]  you say is true i reached a point uh facing uh you know the soviet style show trial that i was
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:19.200]  being subjected to i realized there was no chance that i would be acquitted no chance of a fair trial
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:26.240]  i i i realized that my own lawyers would not even put up a fight even though i had substantial
[1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:33.040]  evidence uh uh you know in emails text message videos audios of my innocence i realized it was
[1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:41.520]  hopeless and therefore i became depressed uh despondent scared for my wife uh and uh it was
[1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:47.440]  then that i had an opportunity uh through my friend reverend randy cognance to meet with reverend
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:52.720]  franklin graham and of course i was still thinking politically because i knew franklin graham was a
[1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:58.080]  good friend of president trumpson i thought maybe i could get him to put in a good word for me for
[1:49:58.080 --> 1:50:02.800]  presidential clemency and while he was kind to say well i'll see what i can do he said let me give
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:08.960]  you a much much better piece of advice you need to turn your burden over to the lord you need to
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:13.280]  you need to confess your sins and start over and this is you told me this dinner sort of crying
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:18.000]  about a year ago or more than a year ago he said you need to get a pardon from the big guy and you
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.200]  asked for that part and continue and then he said you need to turn your life over to christ so i then
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.920]  went immediately to his revival at a field in bokeh ritone with about 2000 other people and there
[1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:36.240]  was a point in his oration where he said i don't care if your problems is a uh drug addiction or
[1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:41.840]  alcohol addiction or gambling addiction or health problems or family problems or financial problems
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:47.920]  i don't care what your problems are the lord will lift you up the lord will sustain you the lord
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:53.840]  will protect you from your persecutors uh if you will get right with god and at that moment
[1:50:53.840 --> 1:51:00.560]  i felt the calling to stand up with 200 other christians uh and reaffirm my faith and be redeemed
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:06.480]  in the blood of the cross and alex from that moment everything changed the commutation of my
[1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:14.400]  sentence uh my unconditional pardon uh my wife's incredible recovery from stage for aggressive
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:20.960]  cancer the fact that on january 6 i never left the hotel grounds i never went to the capital i
[1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:26.560]  never went to the ellipse uh and now i will be calling on the lord again because my persecutors
[1:51:26.560 --> 1:51:33.040]  appear to be focused on me yet again here's the great thing about faith that i've learned if you
[1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:41.200]  have complete faith you are without fear you can download and get away from fear by realizing that
[1:51:41.200 --> 1:51:48.640]  you have to put all of your faith in the lord now was i a wild man alex i was a libertine i
[1:51:48.640 --> 1:51:56.400]  was a wild man you name it i did it i'm not that person anymore and i know that elites laugh at
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:02.640]  us when we talk about christ i know the folks at media matters for america and the new york times
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:08.560]  and the rest of the day snicker when we talk about uh my read my newfound redemption i don't
[1:52:08.560 --> 1:52:15.840]  really care what they think i only care what he thinks and as a political strategist for 40 years
[1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:23.040]  as someone who kind of looks at a set of facts and a situation and devises an overall global
[1:52:23.040 --> 1:52:29.280]  strategy for my clients or from my political point of view i now realize that the single best
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:35.760]  strategy is to put your faith in the lord i do think that the lord will not allow the destruction
[1:52:35.760 --> 1:52:40.320]  of everything that he has well that's right if god be with us who can be against us i don't
[1:52:40.320 --> 1:52:45.840]  claim to be some preacher or some perfect person either but i love god i know god is real and i've
[1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:50.720]  experienced that power and you're right put god and the worship of god the belief in god first
[1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:56.480]  and foremost ask god elite god to direct you and god will change your life and that's our secret weapon
[1:52:56.480 --> 1:53:03.280]  against the satanist well yeah it's funny because a very very major canadian prophet asked me other
[1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:09.200]  day whether alice jones was truly a christian and i said absolutely i mean he's a rascal
[1:53:09.200 --> 1:53:15.760]  but he's a true believe in christian uh and and he believes as i do that the end of the day
[1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:22.640]  the forces of good will will win over the forces of evil because we've read the bible and we know
[1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:28.880]  how it comes out but we're going to go into some very very dark days here and the only way you can
[1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:36.000]  keep your sanity the only way you can stand up to the stress uh is to put your full faith in the lord
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:42.320]  i have done that i'm gonna have to go out and raise more money for lawyers through stone defense fund
[1:53:42.320 --> 1:53:48.640]  dot com i'm sick of asking but these lawyers cost a fortune and the government as you know has
[1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:52.880]  unlimited funds that's right we're targets we're targets roger enclosing because i meant to give
[1:53:52.880 --> 1:53:58.640]  this big question the attacks on trump you expect indictment when is trump said he's going to announce
[1:53:58.640 --> 1:54:04.000]  he is going to run so he's already announcing away but when is that coming you know i i still
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:09.440]  don't i don't have any update on that and i don't really know i i still don't believe based on my own
[1:54:09.440 --> 1:54:16.720]  study that there are criminal charges involved in this document controversy so uh if that's
[1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:21.600]  true i'm not sure what the point is other than to say president trump is most certainly not
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:28.560]  being held to the same standard as barack obama who still has 30 million uh it turns out it's in
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:34.480]  the news today uh reveals obama foundation documents government admits keeping classified
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:41.600]  millions of documents in an abandoned furniture warehouse i saw that so i it's hard to understand
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:49.040]  other than uh i still think they seek to frame him for something on january 6 he has free speech
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:54.800]  rights as well i was not in touch with him during that period interestingly enough but i think they
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:55:02.880]  are so desperate to eliminate him as a candidate legally in some way it's because they fear his
[1:55:02.880 --> 1:55:10.080]  power at the polls uh all of the polls continue to show that he is overwhelmingly uh the the
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:15.200]  overwhelmingly strongest candidate we can nominate doesn't mean that he did everything
[1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:20.320]  right as president nobody would claim that but he has a good heart like king david good trump is good
[1:55:21.040 --> 1:55:25.440]  trump is not an evil man he tried to do a lot of good things he's not good on the vaccines but
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:30.320]  he's pigheaded but they evil hates him because he's real just look at coming after you and me
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:35.760]  that's because our message is strong is pro-human and the enemies of god and country can't stand it
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:41.760]  so so in in closing what can we do to to to make sure we have a republican landslide
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:49.280]  don't take anything for granted don't believe stories that say either that the that the swing
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:56.400]  is to the democrats or that the republicans are home free we need every single person to vote
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:03.920]  and the way you defeat as we saw this in arizona a corrupted election machinery is by voting in
[1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:09.600]  person on election day at the poll i agree let me have this with a minute 45 left and
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:12.240]  you know what if you've got to go you got to go i don't know if you've got to go we see
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:15.360]  five more minutes because this i should have started the show with this i'm not against the
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:19.440]  queue people wanting to believe we're invincible in all those lies i'm not judging you folks you
[1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:23.600]  get conned it's okay i told you the truth i told you there were still from a trump
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:26.960]  roger you said on the show the last few months the election you said they're gonna steal it
[1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:32.320]  the election's too close people shouldn't be confident this q stuff's bad you were vindicated
[1:56:32.320 --> 1:56:38.160]  by that and so people continue to believe this q stuff it's so dangerous complacency
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:44.640]  and the belief of invincibility is our killy seal look i don't criticize anybody who chooses
[1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:50.320]  to believe in q i think they're by and large patriots and i'm not criticizing them at all but
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.200]  the idea that we just need to sit back and do nothing and trust some master plan no i don't
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:57:00.720]  think that that's true i think every one of us needs to do everything we can do to affect change
[1:57:00.720 --> 1:57:05.680]  absolutely but you did predict on this show the major criticism that trump was gonna lose
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:12.320]  i mean i mean you you did that under major heat i did i also predicted uh the the off
[1:57:12.320 --> 1:57:17.520]  here election in fact only sure still owes me a stake over that little wager all right roger i'm
[1:57:17.520 --> 1:57:22.720]  gonna let you go we really appreciate your brother be safe god bless you alex all right god bless

[2:00:24.880 --> 2:00:30.160]  living daylights out of them they censored this because this two-minute speech is the key to taking

[2:00:57.280 --> 2:01:04.400]  we're in a toe-to-toe battle against the globalist and we're taking on the big guys and people ask

[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:12.800]  why don't more people take on the satanist why don't more people why don't more churches why
[2:01:12.800 --> 2:01:19.760]  don't more groups stand up and say no and the answer is when you stand up like i've done
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:25.040]  or desanus is done or trump was done or tucker carlson's done or roger stone's done they come

[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:50.400]  i've told me to prove i'm right
[2:06:50.400 --> 2:06:52.400]  To prove I'm right.
[2:06:52.400 --> 2:06:55.400]  To prove I'm right.
[2:06:55.400 --> 2:06:57.400]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:01.400]  I don't need to be forgiven.
[2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:05.400]  On this live, Thursday broadcast.
[2:07:05.400 --> 2:07:07.400]  All right, I want to go to your phone calls,
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:09.400]  but also want to hit this because it's so central
[2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:11.400]  to understand what's going on.
[2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:14.400]  Former Obama economist Larry Summers,
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:18.400]  we basically had inflation under control for 40 years,
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:21.400]  but we lost the thread about a year and a half ago
[2:07:21.400 --> 2:07:24.400]  with Biden's 1.9 trillion stimulus.
[2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:27.400]  Now, why is that so important?
[2:07:27.400 --> 2:07:32.400]  I'm going to condense a four-year economics degree
[2:07:32.400 --> 2:07:35.400]  if they gave real degrees out in like 60 seconds,
[2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:43.400]  but since Clinton, Bush, and Obama,
[2:07:43.400 --> 2:07:45.400]  we have seen more inflation
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:47.400]  this country had 100 years previous.
[2:07:47.400 --> 2:07:49.400]  Now, under Trump, let's just be honest,
[2:07:49.400 --> 2:07:51.400]  and then accelerating under Biden,
[2:07:51.400 --> 2:07:56.400]  it went into warp speed.
[2:07:56.400 --> 2:07:59.400]  It went into hyperspace.
[2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:01.400]  And now it's just getting more insane.
[2:08:01.400 --> 2:08:05.400]  Why am I a republic, Zimbabwe Republic, numbers?
[2:08:05.400 --> 2:08:07.400]  Because the U.S. has all the high-tech weapons
[2:08:07.400 --> 2:08:09.400]  and the technology, the dollar's still king.
[2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:12.400]  That goes away, it's all over.
[2:08:12.400 --> 2:08:14.400]  So why is he saying that?
[2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.400]  Because Obama runs Biden.
[2:08:16.400 --> 2:08:20.400]  It's the third administration of Obama.
[2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:23.400]  Biden doesn't even know who he is.
[2:08:23.400 --> 2:08:26.400]  As he says, I get my butt wiped.
[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:28.400]  He craps himself repeatedly every day.
[2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:33.400]  It's on record.
[2:08:33.400 --> 2:08:35.400]  So the fact that they're getting ready to blame Biden
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:39.400]  tells you the hammer's going down.
[2:08:39.400 --> 2:08:45.400]  Very, very sad moment that they've got this decrepit puppet,
[2:08:45.400 --> 2:08:48.400]  this Boris Yeltsin 2.0,
[2:08:48.400 --> 2:08:53.400]  not knowing what planet he is on.
[2:08:53.400 --> 2:08:56.400]  Because if bureaucracy wants to be able to scapegoat him,
[2:08:56.400 --> 2:08:58.400]  here's Larry Summers.
[2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:04.400]  We basically had inflation under control for 40 years,
[2:09:04.400 --> 2:09:07.400]  despite the fact that the price of oil fluctuated,
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:14.400]  despite the fact that there were all kinds of supply shocks.
[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:21.400]  We lost the thread along with many other countries
[2:09:21.400 --> 2:09:24.400]  about a year and a half ago
[2:09:24.400 --> 2:09:28.400]  with massively expansionary policies
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:31.400]  relative to the size of the GDP gap.
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.400]  The fiscal stimulus was five times as large
[2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.400]  as it had been during the financial crisis.
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:40.400]  So they've engineered all this,
[2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:42.400]  and now they're blaming their puppet Biden.
[2:09:42.400 --> 2:09:46.400]  Key gaze of U.S. economy activity paints picture of weakness.
[2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:48.400]  Yahoo Finance News.
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:53.400]  The sticky high prices unlikely to come down anytime soon.
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:56.400]  Wall Street Journal.
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  That's where we're at.
[2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:00.400]  Now I'm going to start going to your phone calls next segment,
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:05.400]  but I wanted to play a clip we played on Monday
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:10.400]  of the new Prime Minister of Italy,
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:13.400]  Georgia Maloney.
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:16.400]  And in a two-minute clip, she lays it all out.
[2:10:16.400 --> 2:10:18.400]  It's an attack on individuals, an attack on the family,
[2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:20.400]  an attack on our sovereignty,
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:22.400]  an attack on our very identity
[2:10:22.400 --> 2:10:25.400]  to make us corporate slaves that are programmable.
[2:10:25.400 --> 2:10:29.400]  She said this three years ago when she was a member of parliament.
[2:10:29.400 --> 2:10:33.400]  This video had over 20 million views on YouTube.
[2:10:33.400 --> 2:10:34.400]  They took it down.
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:36.400]  For the 10 million views on Twitter,
[2:10:36.400 --> 2:10:38.400]  they haven't taken it down yet.
[2:10:38.400 --> 2:10:41.400]  A beautiful, smart woman telling the truth.
[2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:44.400]  And again, the censors are now threatened by that,
[2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:49.400]  so they remove it saying it violated the terms of service.
[2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:50.400]  Here's the headline.
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:52.400]  Google silences women.
[2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:57.400]  YouTuber removes Georgia Maloney's viral 2019 speech.
[2:10:57.400 --> 2:10:59.400]  So it's in Italian.
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:01.400]  That beautiful romance language.
[2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:04.400]  And so I'm going to do my best to read this as fast as I can.
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:05.400]  No need to pause it, guys.
[2:11:05.400 --> 2:11:07.400]  I'm just going to read it as it goes.
[2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:11.400]  So you can hear what it is they don't want you to see,
[2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:14.400]  and so you can share this and know this is what they fear.
[2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:17.400]  Good, healthy truth about the EU.
[2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:19.400]  I've eclipsed with her attacking the UN,
[2:11:19.400 --> 2:11:21.400]  attacking the New World Order,
[2:11:21.400 --> 2:11:23.400]  attacking Macron, destroying France.
[2:11:23.400 --> 2:11:25.400]  They're all up on infowords.com,
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:28.400]  but let's start rolling this tape.
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:32.400]  This is about what we are doing here today.
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:36.400]  Why is the family an enemy?
[2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.400]  Why is the family so frightening?
[2:11:40.400 --> 2:11:44.400]  There's a single answer to all these questions.
[2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:48.400]  Because it defines us, because it's our identity.
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:54.400]  Because everything that defines us is now an enemy.
[2:11:54.400 --> 2:12:00.400]  For those who would like us to no longer have an identity,
[2:12:00.400 --> 2:12:05.400]  and it simply be perfect consumer slaves.
[2:12:05.400 --> 2:12:07.400]  And so they attack national identity,
[2:12:07.400 --> 2:12:11.400]  they attack religious identity.
[2:12:11.400 --> 2:12:17.400]  They attack gender identity, they attack family identity.
[2:12:17.400 --> 2:12:19.400]  I can't define myself as an Italian,
[2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:25.400]  a Christian, a woman, a mother. No.
[2:12:25.400 --> 2:12:28.400]  I must be citizen X, gender X.
[2:12:28.400 --> 2:12:33.400]  Parent one, parent two, I must be a number.
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:35.400]  Because when I am only a number,
[2:12:35.400 --> 2:12:40.400]  when I no longer have an identity or roots,
[2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:42.400]  then I will be the perfect slave
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:48.400]  at the mercy of the financial speculators,
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:54.400]  the perfect consumer.
[2:12:54.400 --> 2:12:59.400]  That is the reason why.
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:03.400]  That's why we must inspire so much fear.
[2:13:03.400 --> 2:13:09.400]  That's why this event inspires so much fear.
[2:13:09.400 --> 2:13:12.400]  Because we do not want to be numbers
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:18.400]  who will define the value of the human being.
[2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:20.400]  Every single human being,
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:23.400]  because each of us has a unique genetic code
[2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:26.400]  that is unrepeatable.
[2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:29.400]  And like it or not, this is sacred.
[2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:30.400]  We will defend it.
[2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:32.400]  We will defend God, country and family.
[2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:34.400]  It paused. It paused on that.
[2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:37.400]  It's a total declaration against transhumanism,
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:40.400]  a total declaration against the social credit score,
[2:13:40.400 --> 2:13:42.400]  the carbon tax, the market of the beast,
[2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:44.400]  the new world order, everything they are.
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:46.400]  She's explaining it's a war on you
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:48.400]  and your human biology.
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:53.400]  It's a corporate takeover. Let's continue.
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:58.400]  Back in 10 seconds.
[2:13:58.400 --> 2:14:02.400]  Every single human being, like it or not,
[2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:04.400]  this is sacred. We will defend it.
[2:14:04.400 --> 2:14:13.400]  We will defend God, country and family.
[2:14:13.400 --> 2:14:15.400]  Those things that discuss people so much,
[2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:22.400]  we will do it to defend our freedom.
[2:14:22.400 --> 2:14:24.400]  Because we will never be slaves
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:31.400]  and simple consumers the mercy of financial speculators.
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:38.400]  That is our mission. That is why I came here today.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:45.400]  Chesterton wrote more than a century ago.
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:48.400]  Let's see if I can find it.
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:56.400]  Fires will be kindled to testify that two and two make four.
[2:14:56.400 --> 2:15:04.400]  Swords will be drawn to prove that leaves are green and summer.
[2:15:04.400 --> 2:15:10.400]  The time has arrived. We are ready. Thank you.
[2:15:10.400 --> 2:15:13.400]  That's it in two minutes and they're scared.
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:16.400]  They are taking you over. They are dominating you.
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:18.400]  They are brainwashing you. They are trying to break you.
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:20.400]  But as soon as you are aware of the attack
[2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:22.400]  and as soon as you decide to fight back and speak up
[2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:24.400]  and say no and back those that tell the truth,
[2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:28.400]  you have got on your side. You are invincible.
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:30.400]  So I want you to go now.
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:33.400]  I want you to go now to band.video
[2:15:33.400 --> 2:15:35.400]  and infowars.com forward slash show
[2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:37.400]  and share the best videos, the best articles.
[2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:39.400]  You decide what's best. On your email list,
[2:15:39.400 --> 2:15:41.400]  on your text messages, word of mouth,
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:43.400]  start your own podcast, call and talk radio,
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:45.400]  call and see span. I see you doing it everywhere.
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:47.400]  The enemy is on their heels. They are scared.
[2:15:47.400 --> 2:15:50.400]  They were at the UN two days ago saying censor all of us
[2:15:50.400 --> 2:15:53.400]  as their number one mission because we are kicking their ass.
[2:15:57.400 --> 2:16:02.400]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:06.400]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics
[2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:08.400]  not just in America but the world.
[2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:12.400]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[2:16:12.400 --> 2:16:14.400]  in the information war.
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:16.400]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:17.400]  Yes, I've persevered.
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:20.400]  But the listeners and viewers who support and infowars
[2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:23.400]  for the real reason we've had the success.
[2:16:23.400 --> 2:16:25.400]  We are having now the greatest victories
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:28.400]  in the fight against the new war we've ever had.
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:32.400]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:35.400]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:38.400]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:16:38.400 --> 2:16:40.400]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.400]  and to intensify them.
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:44.400]  I bless you all.
[2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:45.400]  I salute you.
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:46.400]  I thank you.
[2:16:46.400 --> 2:16:49.400]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:16:49.400 --> 2:16:52.400]  because we are over the target and this is happening.
[2:16:52.400 --> 2:16:53.400]  The fight is my fight.
[2:16:53.400 --> 2:16:54.400]  It's your fight.
[2:16:54.400 --> 2:16:55.400]  It's our fight.

[2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:29.040]  and two other types to maximize full absorption.
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:31.040]  This really is the missing link.

[2:19:50.520 --> 2:19:52.760]  but it's for your energy and so much more.

[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:01.160]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:04.720]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:13.600]  You walk into this room at your own risk,
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:15.760]  because it leads to the future.
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:19.240]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:21.480]  This is not a New World.
[2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:25.880]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[2:20:25.880 --> 2:20:28.160]  It has patterned itself after every dictator
[2:20:28.160 --> 2:20:30.600]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot
[2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:34.280]  on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[2:20:34.280 --> 2:20:37.320]  It has refinements, technological advances,
[2:20:37.320 --> 2:20:39.640]  and a more sophisticated approach
[2:20:39.640 --> 2:20:42.360]  to the destruction of human freedom.
[2:20:42.360 --> 2:20:45.520]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it,
[2:20:45.520 --> 2:20:48.040]  it has one iron rule.
[2:20:48.040 --> 2:20:50.680]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[2:20:55.680 --> 2:21:00.680]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on Earth.
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:02.480]  He's a citizen of the state,
[2:21:02.480 --> 2:21:05.040]  but will soon have to be eliminated
[2:21:05.040 --> 2:21:07.520]  because he's built out of flesh
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:08.960]  and because he has a mind.
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.520]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths
[2:21:13.520 --> 2:21:15.520]  in the twilight zone.
[2:21:15.520 --> 2:21:17.520]  The End
[2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:22.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:24.080]  thank you so much for joining us.
[2:21:24.080 --> 2:21:25.720]  I'm gonna jam in a few final news stories
[2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:28.560]  before the show ends or we go into the fourth hour
[2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:31.280]  with the great Paul Joseph Watson from London,
[2:21:31.280 --> 2:21:32.800]  and then in two hours from now,
[2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:36.040]  an hour and 40 minutes from now, Owen Schreuer,
[2:21:36.040 --> 2:21:38.000]  and the war room, the coordinates to find that
[2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:41.800]  are infowars.com, sports.show, and band.video.
[2:21:41.800 --> 2:21:43.640]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[2:21:43.640 --> 2:21:46.000]  Terry and Andrew and Jason and John and Brett and Eric
[2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.080]  and Charles and Doug and Dustin and Austin
[2:21:48.080 --> 2:21:49.360]  and so many others.
[2:21:49.360 --> 2:21:50.960]  Do you remember to call yesterday's callers back?
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:51.800]  I probably forgot to do that.
[2:21:51.800 --> 2:21:53.880]  See if you can get them back online too.
[2:21:53.880 --> 2:21:55.440]  That is the thing where when you don't get to callers,
[2:21:55.440 --> 2:21:56.920]  I want to try to get to them.
[2:21:56.920 --> 2:22:00.080]  Terry in Texas is what I'm obsessing on,
[2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:01.360]  the October surprise.
[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:03.520]  I mean, they're pre-programming right wingers,
[2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:06.120]  terror attacks, mass shootings, we're 40 days out.
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:08.360]  I am super concerned about this.
[2:22:08.360 --> 2:22:10.440]  So many other folks don't see the major branding
[2:22:10.440 --> 2:22:11.840]  and brainwashing going on.
[2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:15.280]  I think it's a central issue, Terry, what do you think?
[2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:18.440]  Alex, I think those hackable voting machines
[2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:20.360]  are going to come into play.
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:23.760]  And I think they're going to blame it on the Russians
[2:22:23.760 --> 2:22:28.680]  and then align the Republicans with the Russians.
[2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:32.600]  That's a really, really good, accurate prediction
[2:22:32.600 --> 2:22:34.680]  of what may happen with all the pre-programming.
[2:22:34.680 --> 2:22:36.440]  Because the pre-programming tells you
[2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:38.160]  what they're going to do and everything's the Russians.
[2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:39.600]  You're right.
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:43.760]  Well, Bill Gates just came out recently saying
[2:22:43.760 --> 2:22:46.840]  that the election was going to come out hung.
[2:22:46.840 --> 2:22:51.160]  And it all points to that to me.
[2:22:51.160 --> 2:22:54.200]  I also want to say, Alex, it's funny
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:22:56.920]  that you played that clip from the Twilight Zone,
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:01.760]  because I was thinking today how much stranger the world is
[2:23:01.760 --> 2:23:04.680]  than what they predicted in the Twilight Zone.
[2:23:04.680 --> 2:23:09.960]  That clip should have had a guy in cuss and a beard.
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:11.320]  Yeah, Virgin Atlantic says they're
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:15.000]  going to have their male flight attendants wear dresses now.
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:19.400]  I mean, it's just total war on our biology.
[2:23:19.400 --> 2:23:21.960]  It's a bizarre world.
[2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:23.120]  Good luck to you.
[2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:25.840]  Let me ask you this before you go, before you go, Terry.
[2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:28.320]  What do you make of Kamala Harris saying North Korea
[2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:30.880]  is our biggest ally?
[2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:35.360]  Well, I think she's completely mentally incompetent,
[2:23:35.360 --> 2:23:37.840]  or she meant to say South Korea, or she
[2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:40.000]  doesn't know the difference between North and South Korea.
[2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:40.560]  No, I agree.
[2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:42.920]  But I mean, you notice she's always wearing glasses.
[2:23:42.920 --> 2:23:44.120]  She's always slurring her words.
[2:23:44.120 --> 2:23:47.320]  She looks like she's on Xanax.
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:50.800]  She's a freak like the rest of them.
[2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:52.520]  How do you explain it?
[2:23:52.520 --> 2:23:53.800]  You can't.
[2:23:53.800 --> 2:23:57.200]  It's a runaway train with a bunch of Satan's minions.
[2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:00.040]  And look at what Satan does for you, how dumb they are,
[2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:02.280]  how unhappy they are, how horrible their families are.
[2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:04.200]  Why would anybody want to serve Satan?
[2:24:04.200 --> 2:24:04.920]  Great points, Terry.
[2:24:04.920 --> 2:24:05.960]  Thank you.
[2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:09.480]  Andrew in Florida hit by the terrible hurricane.
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:11.280]  Go ahead.
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:12.080]  Hey, Mr. Johnson.
[2:24:12.080 --> 2:24:14.080]  I'm actually up here in the Panhandle.
[2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:14.800]  We're doing all right.
[2:24:14.800 --> 2:24:19.360]  We've got a lot of strong winds, but we're fine there.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:21.640]  I know Florida Power and Light is doing a really great job
[2:24:21.640 --> 2:24:23.240]  of getting people's power back on.
[2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:24.880]  If you want to follow Representative Randy
[2:24:24.880 --> 2:24:27.440]  Fine from Brevard County on Facebook,
[2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:29.200]  he's got a lot of great confident information
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:31.480]  about that, as well as Governor DeSantis' press
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:32.880]  conferences.
[2:24:32.880 --> 2:24:35.400]  First off, I just really wanted to thank you for what you do.
[2:24:35.400 --> 2:24:37.720]  I've been listening to you for the past couple of years,
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:39.320]  and you really opened my eyes to a lot.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:42.000]  And then I wanted to ask for a quick favor.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:44.040]  Going into the last break, you said
[2:24:44.040 --> 2:24:46.720]  you encouraged your listeners to start their own podcast.
[2:24:46.720 --> 2:24:48.640]  Can I tell you a quick story about my father
[2:24:48.640 --> 2:24:50.280]  who has his own podcast?
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:51.680]  Please do.
[2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:54.760]  OK, so he's been in small market radio
[2:24:54.760 --> 2:24:56.520]  for a couple of decades now.
[2:24:56.520 --> 2:25:00.360]  His most previous job was on K.R.N. out of Little Rock,
[2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:01.840]  Arkansas.
[2:25:01.840 --> 2:25:02.680]  He was fired.
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:05.680]  This is the same company that syndicated Dan Bongino.
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:09.160]  He was fired when he did not bend to corporate will
[2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:10.680]  with the Vax mandate.
[2:25:10.680 --> 2:25:13.120]  And Bongino, as a screw you to the company,
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:15.400]  had him on to tell his story.
[2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:17.400]  But he started his own podcast after that.
[2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:19.200]  It's docwashburnshow.com.
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:22.520]  He's got a great interview with Cash Patel, most recently.
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:24.760]  A lot of great shows on there.
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:27.040]  And I just wanted to plug that real quick.
[2:25:27.040 --> 2:25:27.480]  Beautiful.
[2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:29.480]  Say the name of your dad again.
[2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:31.760]  Docwashburnshow.com.
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:32.560]  Doc Washburn.
[2:25:32.560 --> 2:25:34.000]  All right, I remember hearing about that.
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:35.280]  That's great, brother.
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:37.200]  What else?
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:39.840]  Oh, that's all I had for you, Mr. Jenza.
[2:25:39.840 --> 2:25:42.080]  Like I said, I've been trying to think of an excuse
[2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:44.720]  to call you for all two years I've been listening to you.
[2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:47.400]  And I finally just figured I'd call you and say thank you.
[2:25:47.400 --> 2:25:48.160]  Well, thank you.
[2:25:48.160 --> 2:25:49.200]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:50.520]  Let's get your dad on the show.
[2:25:50.520 --> 2:25:53.240]  Because they use the COVID shots not just to kill people,
[2:25:53.240 --> 2:25:56.200]  but as a litmus test in the military, the police, everywhere
[2:25:56.200 --> 2:25:58.600]  to find out who'll tell the line, your dad's been vindicated.
[2:25:58.600 --> 2:25:59.920]  He should be given his job back.
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:00.840]  They should apologize.
[2:26:00.840 --> 2:26:01.880]  Shame on them.
[2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:02.600]  Put him on hold.
[2:26:02.600 --> 2:26:03.320]  See what we get his dad on.
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:04.000]  Thank you.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:05.520]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air.
[2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:07.360]  Go ahead.
[2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:08.160]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:09.160]  How you doing there?
[2:26:09.160 --> 2:26:12.400]  I'm fighting as hard as I ever had, brother.
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:14.000]  So I think the two weeks are up.
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:14.360]  Thank you.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:15.600]  And should give Trump two weeks.
[2:26:15.600 --> 2:26:18.040]  You're still promoting the big vaccine salesman,
[2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:19.680]  the guy that flew on Epstein's plane.
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:21.080]  Why are you doing that, Biden?
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:21.960]  Oh, yeah.
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:22.800]  Yeah, it's true.
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:23.960]  I mean, I didn't give him two weeks.
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:25.400]  I think I gave him like a month.
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:27.200]  And I've been really against Trump on that.
[2:26:27.200 --> 2:26:31.520]  And he flew on a flight from New York to Florida
[2:26:31.520 --> 2:26:33.280]  on a chartered flight with Epstein.
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:34.640]  He never flew.
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:35.120]  Hold on.
[2:26:35.120 --> 2:26:36.560]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:37.360]  You make a statement.
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:40.200]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:41.080]  Come on, man.
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:41.640]  He'll hear you.
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:42.200]  Oh, hold on.
[2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:43.320]  Don't talk over me.
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:45.720]  You're going to put him on hold.
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:47.760]  Sir, I love calls to disagree.
[2:26:47.760 --> 2:26:51.520]  But I'm not going to have callers that lie, OK?
[2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:53.240]  So you can talk.
[2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:56.440]  Just I'm going to counter each fly as you go through them.
[2:26:56.440 --> 2:26:59.040]  Trump did not ever fly on Alita Express
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:00.880]  to Little St. John's Island.
[2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:05.800]  He did fly once in the 90s on Epstein's plane from New York
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:08.000]  with a bunch of other people to Florida.
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.480]  And if I find that Trump's involved or on the list
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:12.440]  of those flights, I'll be against him.
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:13.640]  I've not found that.
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:16.200]  So you didn't call in about the John's list
[2:27:16.200 --> 2:27:17.840]  suppressed by the feds.
[2:27:17.840 --> 2:27:21.280]  You didn't call in about the same judge
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:23.200]  that protected Epstein going after Trump.
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:24.120]  You didn't raise that.
[2:27:24.120 --> 2:27:27.280]  You just tried to dumb my audience down.
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:28.360]  I'm asking you again.
[2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:31.480]  Did Trump fly to the Caribbean with Jeffrey
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:34.480]  Epstein on Alita Express?
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:36.760]  I am possibly your biggest fan, Alex.
[2:27:36.760 --> 2:27:37.600]  I love you.
[2:27:37.600 --> 2:27:39.320]  You have so much respect for you.
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:40.560]  Brother, I love you too.
[2:27:40.560 --> 2:27:42.360]  I'm just, listen, listen.
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:44.920]  If I think Trump's a pedophile, I'll come out against him.
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.320]  I know people that know him well.
[2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:47.840]  He's not into kids.
[2:27:47.840 --> 2:27:49.200]  So what I'm asking you is, are you
[2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:51.920]  saying he flew to Epstein Island?
[2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:55.040]  I'm saying Epstein and Gates got a president in there, bud,
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:27:58.000]  and sighed up to you and to believe in him, straight up
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:27:58.560]  and down.
[2:27:58.560 --> 2:28:00.520]  And Roger Stone is probably the main guy
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:04.680]  they got working for him and keeping you along on the Trump
[2:28:04.680 --> 2:28:05.920]  train.
[2:28:05.920 --> 2:28:08.680]  You need to do the Trump deception yesterday.
[2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:11.560]  I just wish you would so bad because you did the Obama
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:12.000]  deception.
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:13.520]  It was literally just so perfect.
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:18.000]  Sir, I can tell you the persecution of Roger Stone
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.720]  is real.
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:23.880]  So give me evidence that Roger Stone works for Jeffrey Epstein.
[2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:26.400]  Go ahead and give it to me.
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:29.480]  I got no evidence to that other than my gut tells me
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:31.240]  this person's good, this person's bad.
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:33.200]  And I believe Trump for a long time.
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:35.440]  I went to the place that shall not
[2:28:35.440 --> 2:28:37.680]  be named for him, for the whole thing,
[2:28:37.680 --> 2:28:39.080]  because I believed in him.
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:41.720]  But you know what, the next day, my buddy,
[2:28:41.720 --> 2:28:43.480]  I'm going to give him a shout out, Cicero.
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:46.920]  My buddy Cicero came with the most wisdom that he always does.
[2:28:46.920 --> 2:28:51.360]  He said, the perfect three words, please set us up.
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:52.760]  Four words, D. OK.
[2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:54.480]  Well, Biden's in power now, so we
[2:28:54.480 --> 2:28:56.520]  can get off the tag of Trump.
[2:28:56.520 --> 2:29:01.400]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[2:29:01.400 --> 2:29:03.240]  Just take a moment and sit back and think
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:06.600]  about all the incredible guests and callers and stories
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:11.000]  we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:14.400]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker
[2:29:14.400 --> 2:29:18.440]  Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel
[2:29:18.440 --> 2:29:23.720]  Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up
[2:29:23.720 --> 2:29:27.240]  their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:31.040]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:34.400]  because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[2:29:34.400 --> 2:29:37.600]  have taken action and supported this show.
[2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:39.320]  I don't take the credit.
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:41.040]  I give you the credit.
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:43.680]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:45.240]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:47.120]  Without your support, we can be shut down.

[2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:08.680]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:18.960]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:33:18.960 --> 2:33:21.000]  you are the resistance.
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:25.880]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:33:25.880 --> 2:33:26.640]  show.
[2:33:26.640 --> 2:33:28.240]  By the way, let me just throw this show.
[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:30.520]  We've got some big guests tomorrow on the Live Friday
[2:33:30.520 --> 2:33:36.000]  show, and this Saturday, I've already got several huge.
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:37.440]  It's a very special guest lined up.
[2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:39.080]  We're going to tape in the morning.
[2:33:39.080 --> 2:33:42.080]  It'll be posted at Band Up Video and stream
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:45.280]  by 2 or 3 o'clock Saturday.
[2:33:45.280 --> 2:33:47.040]  Definitely want to look for that.
[2:33:47.040 --> 2:33:49.320]  But let me get to the Trump thing the last caller brought up.
[2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:51.120]  I just like him talking over me and like, you know,
[2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:53.600]  Fitzgerald, like, and all crazy, and then saying some stuff
[2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:55.440]  that wasn't true about Epstein Island.
[2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:57.280]  I'm very critical of Trump about the vaccine.
[2:33:57.280 --> 2:34:00.720]  I've said that, I wish he was better.
[2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:04.760]  But this obsession, he's not in power now.
[2:34:04.760 --> 2:34:06.280]  The globalist star.
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:07.480]  And the crew brought me this.
[2:34:07.480 --> 2:34:10.800]  And look, I know that Georgia Maloney isn't perfect,
[2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:12.640]  but they're censoring her speeches.
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:13.720]  They're coming after her.
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:15.880]  The EU is threatening to sanction her.
[2:34:15.880 --> 2:34:19.080]  I can just look at her and tell you she's for real.
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:21.080]  Doesn't mean that she's perfect, though.
[2:34:21.080 --> 2:34:23.640]  Dears of the Lensky, you know that you
[2:34:23.640 --> 2:34:26.200]  can count on our loyal support for the cause of freedom
[2:34:26.200 --> 2:34:27.480]  in Ukraine, people.
[2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:32.680]  Stay strong, keep your face, she said, just two days ago.
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:36.480]  Doesn't mean that she, I mean, I'm on the Russian side either.
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:39.880]  I'm on the Ukrainian side, I'm on the side of peace.
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:41.440]  But that's where we are.
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:44.000]  Now, I want to hit more of your calls.
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.560]  John Brett Charles is up next.
[2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:50.680]  Doug Dustin and Austin, but let me hit this real quick.
[2:34:50.680 --> 2:34:54.680]  One of the top guys, he's had like 10 number one songs.
[2:34:54.680 --> 2:34:57.240]  Kulio, Gangster's Paradise.
[2:34:57.240 --> 2:34:59.680]  We're all living in Gangster's Paradise.
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:02.440]  He'd come out and spoke out against Epstein the pedophiles.
[2:35:02.440 --> 2:35:06.320]  He died at 56 years old yesterday.
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:08.480]  And I got a chance to talk to somebody
[2:35:08.480 --> 2:35:10.920]  that knew him well, a very well-known person.
[2:35:10.920 --> 2:35:11.720]  I'll leave it at that.
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:14.960]  And they confirmed that Kulio earlier this year
[2:35:14.960 --> 2:35:19.440]  took the Pfizer shot when he went to Australia.
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:21.680]  In fact, he'd taken multiple shots
[2:35:21.680 --> 2:35:24.760]  to be able to go to Australia.
[2:35:24.760 --> 2:35:26.720]  So this headline deals with the flashback.
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:29.600]  Rapper Kulio says he kills pedophiles.
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:32.200]  They should be erased from the face of the earth.
[2:35:32.200 --> 2:35:34.080]  That's an important article on infowars.com.
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:37.000]  But I can give you the exclusive that let me pull up
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:40.560]  the actual message I got when I talked to the person.
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:43.280]  I'm going to put this message on here.
[2:35:43.280 --> 2:35:46.360]  But let me pull it up here.
[2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:48.200]  Gosh, so many texts come in.
[2:35:48.200 --> 2:35:52.280]  So hard to keep track of all this.
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:53.480]  Let me see this.
[2:35:53.480 --> 2:35:54.240]  Pull it up for you.
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:36:00.040]  Kulio did a gig in Australia in March.
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:05.280]  So he was injected from the sources they've talked to.
[2:36:05.280 --> 2:36:06.640]  So there you go, folks.
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:13.240]  So many people dead.
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:15.720]  And the statistics show it's massive.
[2:36:15.720 --> 2:36:18.120]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:19.720]  Charles in Atlanta.
[2:36:19.720 --> 2:36:21.400]  Charles, thanks for being with us today.
[2:36:21.400 --> 2:36:21.960]  You're on the here.
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:23.200]  Welcome.
[2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:25.320]  Hey, how you been, Alex?
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:26.560]  Welcome.
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:26.800]  Good.
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:29.600]  I've been listening to you since you were 25 years old,
[2:36:29.600 --> 2:36:32.000]  nearly every single day, if you believe that.
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:35.520]  So I'm kind of hatching in a couple of years on me.
[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:37.240]  Brother, you are old school, and we're
[2:36:37.240 --> 2:36:39.800]  blessed you've been putting up with my loud mouth.
[2:36:39.800 --> 2:36:44.760]  No, actually, I just fell in love with, you know,
[2:36:44.760 --> 2:36:47.600]  when I was 17, I was turned on to the world
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:49.440]  as not as it seems.
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:53.000]  And I would listen to black programming
[2:36:53.000 --> 2:36:57.160]  concerning the use of black energy
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:36:59.760]  throughout the last 300, 400 years
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:02.840]  to the New World Order's demands.
[2:37:02.840 --> 2:37:05.000]  And then when I heard somebody talk about you,
[2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:08.600]  I turned on your station when I was 23 years old.
[2:37:08.600 --> 2:37:10.680]  Oh, not 23, but 40.
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:13.680]  And never stopped listening since then.
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:15.600]  But here's what I've done.
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:19.080]  I was a transit driver here in Atlanta for 21 years,
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:22.680]  and I would distribute your DVDs on the bus route.
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:25.680]  Nearly every single day, I'd bring a package of 10,
[2:37:25.680 --> 2:37:29.640]  be it American dictators, fall of the Republic,
[2:37:29.640 --> 2:37:32.360]  true legends, in game, tear storm.
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:35.560]  I would carry these in a package and make copies.
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:38.720]  I have a 7-up DVD burner, and I would burn them
[2:37:38.720 --> 2:37:41.160]  and put a label on them and distribute them.
[2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:43.240]  You are old school.
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:44.960]  We reached tens of millions of people
[2:37:44.960 --> 2:37:46.840]  thanks to folks like you.
[2:37:46.840 --> 2:37:47.680]  Exactly.
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:49.880]  Well, here's the thing I leave your audience with.
[2:37:49.880 --> 2:37:52.040]  I want to talk to all the audience there
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.320]  that if you don't have this set up,
[2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:55.880]  find a friend that can do this for you.
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:37:58.320]  I'm a graphic artist photographer, a website designer.
[2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:02.160]  I know how to take your clips,
[2:38:02.160 --> 2:38:04.000]  download them from Band-Aid video,
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:05.360]  put them on an iPhone.
[2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:09.040]  What I do, I put on the viruses,
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:12.920]  the media is a virus t-shirt and a ball cap I have,
[2:38:12.920 --> 2:38:14.440]  go over to Kroger's.
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:17.520]  And I intentionally put about a one to three minute
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:21.240]  video clip of any powerful news on your program.
[2:38:21.240 --> 2:38:23.440]  I just walk up to a total stranger and say,
[2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:25.520]  hey, have you seen this before?
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:28.000]  And then I'll show them a few seconds of the video
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.680]  and when their eyes pop and their jaw drop,
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:32.040]  well, no, I didn't know that.
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:34.760]  Where did you see that at?
[2:38:34.760 --> 2:38:37.680]  I made over 2,000, 3,000 business cards
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:39.160]  with Band-Aid video on them.
[2:38:39.160 --> 2:38:41.640]  They're real cheap, black and white,
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:47.440]  one side, you could get them for...
[2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:48.440]  Sir, that is beautiful.
[2:38:48.440 --> 2:38:54.640]  Keep going, your phone cut off for a moment.
[2:38:54.640 --> 2:38:57.920]  Charles there, is Charles still there?
[2:38:57.920 --> 2:38:59.600]  Well, that's a bummer that Charles dropped.
[2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:00.840]  We didn't hang up on you, Charles.
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:02.560]  Call Charles back.
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:04.480]  The reason we can call Charles back is
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:05.920]  you hear him at the end of the show sometimes,
[2:39:05.920 --> 2:39:07.320]  people are on hold.
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:08.640]  And I say, give us your number,
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:09.880]  we'll call you back tomorrow and get you on.
[2:39:09.880 --> 2:39:11.160]  We did that.
[2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:13.040]  And so I'm not gonna sit here
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:15.240]  and have what Charles said cut off.
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:16.560]  So call Charles back
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:19.360]  because I really wanna hear what he has to say.
[2:39:19.360 --> 2:39:21.920]  Folks, whether it's Alex Jones' information
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:24.160]  or other Patriots' information,
[2:39:24.160 --> 2:39:27.480]  they cannot stand what he was just doing.
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:29.480]  That will override their censorship,
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:31.120]  the people are so hungry for the truth.
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:32.640]  Charles, are you back?
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:33.640]  Yes, I'm back.
[2:39:33.640 --> 2:39:35.440]  Yes, sir, you were saying you're at Kroger's,
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:37.120]  handing out things, you play him a short clip,
[2:39:37.120 --> 2:39:39.240]  it has a big effect, please continue.
[2:39:39.240 --> 2:39:42.840]  I'm in the city of fixer 700 million in Atlanta, Georgia,
[2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:45.240]  and I make it my point to carry 40,
[2:39:45.240 --> 2:39:48.560]  at least 40 of the same business cards
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:50.640]  to have Band-Aid video on them.
[2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:52.360]  And I make sure I give out two or three
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:54.240]  every time I go anywhere.
[2:39:54.240 --> 2:39:56.680]  Because it's very simple just to put a little clip
[2:39:56.680 --> 2:39:58.000]  on your phone and ask people,
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.840]  hey, have you heard of this?
[2:39:59.840 --> 2:40:01.680]  And just show them a few seconds
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:04.920]  and 99% of people will talk to you.
[2:40:04.920 --> 2:40:07.680]  And they say, no, where'd you get that information?
[2:40:07.680 --> 2:40:10.080]  I give them a card with Band-Aid video.
[2:40:10.080 --> 2:40:13.240]  I've exposed, I'm sure, multiple thousands of people
[2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:15.560]  over 20 years I've been here.
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:17.800]  But Alex, I want to commend you
[2:40:17.800 --> 2:40:21.560]  and ask all the people listening to please send your money
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:22.960]  to InfoWars.
[2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:28.640]  When you think of the side link of the 50 or so contributors,
[2:40:28.640 --> 2:40:32.880]  David Ike, Savannah, flyover conservatives,
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:36.960]  Christie Lee is the bottom, you need to have her one more,
[2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:40.280]  Kate Dally, there's just a humongous two or three
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:46.760]  to lifetimes worth of information on your site.
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:47.520]  God bless you, brother.
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:48.280]  We're fighting hard.
[2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:50.880]  But what you're doing is the greatest on the ground.
[2:40:50.880 --> 2:40:52.240]  They're so scared of people like you.
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:52.880]  God bless you.
[2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:54.480]  And I appreciate your call, Charles.
[2:40:54.480 --> 2:40:55.280]  What an amazing man.
[2:40:55.280 --> 2:40:56.560]  God bless you, Charles.
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:40:57.680]  Let's go to John in Florida.
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:40:58.400]  John, you're on the air.
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:40:59.040]  Go ahead.
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:01.960]  How is it in Florida, my friend?
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:05.920]  Yeah, well, I'm in Jacksonville right now.
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:07.440]  We're still far today.
[2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:08.960]  It's just been really windy.
[2:41:08.960 --> 2:41:10.200]  I mean, we're stinking some of it,
[2:41:10.200 --> 2:41:12.160]  but we're actually, if we've been blessed,
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:15.360]  that we haven't experienced what the West Side has experienced.
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:18.000]  So can't say it's too bad right now.
[2:41:18.000 --> 2:41:19.480]  The Santa's Trump, you want to talk about it?
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:20.760]  Go ahead.
[2:41:20.760 --> 2:41:21.600]  Yeah.
[2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:24.360]  So first, I'll give you credit.
[2:41:24.360 --> 2:41:26.640]  You've been really the only one out of all the people
[2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:29.720]  I get my news from that has been critical of Trump
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:31.400]  and actually challenged him.
[2:41:31.400 --> 2:41:33.560]  And I credit you for that.
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:37.240]  But I think this is just a crime that's unforgivable.
[2:41:37.240 --> 2:41:40.680]  And if as conservative and as populist as pro-humans,
[2:41:40.680 --> 2:41:44.000]  I think as a whole, we need to shift our support
[2:41:44.000 --> 2:41:45.040]  from Trump to the Santa's.
[2:41:45.040 --> 2:41:49.600]  I mean, we need to go all in on Ron DeSantis.
[2:41:49.600 --> 2:41:53.200]  And I just can't forgive Trump for backing Operation Warp
[2:41:53.200 --> 2:41:53.800]  to be a peaceful place.
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:54.800]  Well, let me say this.
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:58.760]  The caller before last accused me of covering up for Trump
[2:41:58.760 --> 2:41:59.720]  and use false info.
[2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:01.280]  And I'm not mad at the caller, but he did.
[2:42:01.280 --> 2:42:02.400]  You're being legitimate.
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:04.040]  The vaccine thing, I don't blame anybody
[2:42:04.040 --> 2:42:05.040]  that's against Trump now.
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:06.160]  I totally agree with you.
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:08.440]  It makes me sick.
[2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:10.440]  No, yeah, exactly.
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:12.880]  That's why I give you credit.
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:16.000]  You were literally the only one out of almost.
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:16.960]  I listen to a lot of people.
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:18.120]  You're the only one who's convinced me.
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:19.080]  Well, brother, don't hang up.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:20.080]  I'm going to come back to you, John.
[2:42:20.080 --> 2:42:20.880]  I want to cut you short.
[2:42:20.880 --> 2:42:22.480]  Let me just be clear.
[2:42:22.480 --> 2:42:25.000]  Don't give me credit for coming out against Trump.
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:25.760]  I feel guilty.
[2:42:25.760 --> 2:42:26.520]  I didn't do it earlier.
[2:42:26.520 --> 2:42:28.360]  OK, let's just be clear.
[2:42:28.360 --> 2:42:31.200]  Let's just get 100% clear about that.
[2:42:31.200 --> 2:42:32.960]  Trump did so much good, and they hate him.
[2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:35.080]  And I know he's not a bad person, but he is.
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:36.800]  Pig-headed, man.
[2:42:36.800 --> 2:42:39.520]  He doesn't listen to anybody, which is why they hate him.
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:40.800]  The globalists couldn't run him.
[2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:43.480]  But when he won't, he's not a bad person,
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:45.120]  but he's just got flaws.
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:47.200]  And we all do, and I'm not judging him,
[2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:48.960]  but I agree DeSantis is better.
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:50.720]  And I'm not trying to pick sides here.
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:52.520]  I wish Trump would get his act together.
[2:42:52.520 --> 2:42:55.120]  But when he saw my video, he said, tell Alex, basically,
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:56.840]  I don't care.
[2:42:56.840 --> 2:42:58.360]  Look around you.
[2:42:58.360 --> 2:43:01.280]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents,
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:03.400]  from their own admissions, is now happening.
[2:43:03.400 --> 2:43:05.160]  Info wars credibility.
[2:43:05.160 --> 2:43:07.360]  My credibility has never been higher.
[2:43:07.360 --> 2:43:09.760]  And it's because of your backing of this operation
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:12.880]  that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship,
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:14.880]  and the boycotts, and the attacks,
[2:43:14.880 --> 2:43:16.680]  and the lawsuits stay on air.
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:20.120]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:22.320]  in the fight together.
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:26.760]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:29.920]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:31.880]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[2:43:31.880 --> 2:43:33.800]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees,
[2:43:33.800 --> 2:43:36.160]  and I can't fund those myself.
[2:43:36.160 --> 2:43:37.440]  It's unsustainable.
[2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:41.720]  So please, visit saveinfowars.com.
[2:43:41.720 --> 2:43:45.280]  Saveinfowars.com, where you can make straight donations,
[2:43:45.280 --> 2:43:48.120]  five, 10, $50, $100, whatever you can,

[2:43:49.880 --> 2:43:51.720]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in,
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:52.800]  but I could give out.
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:54.160]  Thank you for your support.

[2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:03.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist.
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:06.920]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[2:46:06.920 --> 2:46:09.440]  not just in America, but the world.
[2:46:09.440 --> 2:46:12.920]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[2:46:12.920 --> 2:46:16.320]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:19.320]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:21.760]  who are supporting infowars are the real reason
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:23.480]  you've had the success.
[2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:25.720]  We're having now the greatest victories
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:28.880]  in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[2:46:28.880 --> 2:46:33.200]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon,
[2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:36.280]  and that's why today it's more important than ever,
[2:46:36.280 --> 2:46:38.480]  realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:46:38.480 --> 2:46:41.080]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[2:46:41.080 --> 2:46:42.440]  and to intensify them.
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:43.760]  God bless you all.
[2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:46.920]  I salute you, I thank you, and I beg you
[2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:48.840]  to intensify what you're doing now
[2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:52.000]  because we are over the target and this street is happening.
[2:46:52.000 --> 2:46:54.640]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[2:46:54.640 --> 2:46:55.800]  God bless you all.
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:00.240]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:03.840]  of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:03.840 --> 2:47:15.840]  Get up, stand up, escape from the push and pull.
[2:47:15.840 --> 2:47:31.840]  Get up, easy, let's change from the face of the planet.
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:33.240]  We're all in together, folks.
[2:47:33.240 --> 2:47:35.320]  Put us in a stable color we are and come together
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:38.280]  against Satan with Christ empowering us
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:40.280]  what we're done for.
[2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:42.760]  OK, John, yeah, I mean, I can bash Trump all day.
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:45.800]  I get really mad about Trump, but he's not in there right now.
[2:47:45.800 --> 2:47:48.000]  I wish he would wake up.
[2:47:48.000 --> 2:47:50.400]  He's doing so good on so many issues,
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:53.000]  but it just becomes a distraction for me
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:54.440]  to deal with Trump all day.
[2:47:54.440 --> 2:47:56.760]  But yeah, I mean, I like DeSantis a lot more.
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:47:58.880]  DeSantis now admits the vaccines don't work in her bad,
[2:47:58.880 --> 2:47:59.920]  we shouldn't do it.
[2:47:59.920 --> 2:48:01.920]  It's all come out that Trump's wrong,
[2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:03.600]  but they're poisoning us and now they're leaving him
[2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:05.560]  holding the bag, but at the same time,
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:07.520]  we got so many big fish to fry.
[2:48:07.520 --> 2:48:09.720]  What's your take on that?
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:11.800]  I totally agree we have so many big fish to fry,
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:16.680]  and Trump overall is good and did good for the country.
[2:48:16.680 --> 2:48:19.600]  The main burden here is on conservative ink.
[2:48:19.600 --> 2:48:23.280]  The main line conservatives, the daily wires of the world,
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:24.920]  they need to start pressuring Trump
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:27.160]  to get on stuff like this.
[2:48:27.160 --> 2:48:30.280]  And I listen to daily wires still,
[2:48:30.280 --> 2:48:33.800]  and those guys over there, like Michael Mills and Matt Walsh,
[2:48:33.800 --> 2:48:35.320]  who I totally agree with on most things,
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:39.120]  even they like you, like Michael Mills says straight up,
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:41.720]  Alex Jones was right, they sat deep with you,
[2:48:41.720 --> 2:48:44.800]  and now they understand like what you were saying.
[2:48:44.800 --> 2:48:47.840]  Well, that's the good news is even main line Republicans
[2:48:47.840 --> 2:48:49.480]  are now waking up that we're right.
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:51.480]  So that's a positive thing, thanks for the call.
[2:48:51.480 --> 2:48:54.920]  Brett, in Ohio, Brett, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:58.560]  Hey, Alex, I just wanted to take a couple minutes to talk to you.
[2:48:58.560 --> 2:49:01.680]  I originally called for Harrison Smith in the morning,
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:03.240]  and I was on hold for about three hours,
[2:49:03.240 --> 2:49:06.640]  and then so it's a miracle that I got back through to you.
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:08.400]  I'm glad you're here, you wanna talk about NATO,
[2:49:08.400 --> 2:49:10.200]  the pipeline, go ahead.
[2:49:10.200 --> 2:49:11.520]  Well, that's what I was gonna talk about,
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:13.640]  but I feel like that you've covered that pretty extensively.
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:16.640]  No, give us your views, go ahead and hit the other topic.
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:19.560]  It's escalation, I don't like escalation,
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:23.480]  especially when Russia has nukes, we have nukes,
[2:49:23.480 --> 2:49:25.880]  many parts of NATO has nukes,
[2:49:25.880 --> 2:49:27.120]  and I just don't like the escalation,
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:29.320]  I wish that there was some kind of de-escalation going on,
[2:49:29.320 --> 2:49:30.880]  but there's almost no time.
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:32.680]  I agree, it's nothing but escalation,
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:36.120]  there's not much more escalation now, but nuclear war.
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:38.520]  Or here's a question, will Russia start blowing up
[2:49:38.520 --> 2:49:39.880]  European pipelines?
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:46.360]  I have no idea about that, I'm not inside Putin's brain,
[2:49:46.360 --> 2:49:48.320]  so I don't know what he's gonna do.
[2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:49.920]  It wouldn't surprise me though,
[2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:53.160]  but I did wanna just kinda talk to you personally,
[2:49:53.160 --> 2:49:56.080]  because I just wanted to basically apologize,
[2:49:56.080 --> 2:49:58.320]  because for a long time I just thought you were kinda crazy,
[2:49:58.320 --> 2:50:00.280]  like I used to be a gay fraud guy,
[2:50:00.280 --> 2:50:03.760]  but then when you were on with Joe Rogan,
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:06.800]  and you were vindicated on what you talked about
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:09.360]  with like the human-animal hybrids,
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:11.120]  Jamie pulled up an article,
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:13.560]  if you've had a phone since 1987,
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:16.080]  there's a record of that phone call being made,
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:17.640]  and Jamie pulled up another article,
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:22.640]  and I thought of a quote from I think Tyrion Lannister,
[2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:25.960]  he said, if you tear out the tongue of a man,
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:27.080]  you're not proving him wrong,
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:28.520]  you're just telling the world that you're afraid
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:30.160]  of what he might say.
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:33.720]  And so I think that the meme of Alex Jones was right,
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:35.600]  I think that, you know, that's a wonderful meme,
[2:50:35.600 --> 2:50:37.360]  but I think what would be more powerful,
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:41.120]  at least to me, would be Alex Jones was telling the truth,
[2:50:41.120 --> 2:50:44.360]  because it's, and you've been wrong in some things,
[2:50:44.360 --> 2:50:46.800]  and you've apologized for those things,
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:49.920]  but you've been right on far more stuff
[2:50:49.920 --> 2:50:51.600]  than you've been wrong,
[2:50:51.600 --> 2:50:56.200]  and I think it's much more powerful to say,
[2:50:56.200 --> 2:50:57.280]  he was just telling the truth,
[2:50:57.280 --> 2:50:58.520]  he was just reading the news,
[2:50:58.520 --> 2:50:59.720]  and he was telling the truth.
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:00.800]  He wasn't lying to you.
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:03.280]  Absolutely, but we take the Sandy Hook thing.
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:04.680]  I never really covered that,
[2:51:04.680 --> 2:51:06.360]  I covered what people were saying,
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:07.920]  and then later I said, okay, it happened,
[2:51:07.920 --> 2:51:10.320]  but now that I've seen the trials rigged,
[2:51:10.320 --> 2:51:11.520]  and how it all looks,
[2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:14.800]  I mean, it's definitely the whole thing's deep state,
[2:51:14.800 --> 2:51:16.200]  that's all I can say.
[2:51:16.200 --> 2:51:19.440]  So I think the public's original instinct about it was right,
[2:51:19.440 --> 2:51:20.680]  I don't know what really happened there,
[2:51:20.680 --> 2:51:24.040]  but it is synthetic as hell.
[2:51:24.040 --> 2:51:25.920]  Right, and I think that you're right to question things,
[2:51:25.920 --> 2:51:28.440]  I mean, that's the right of every American,
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:29.720]  but for me personally,
[2:51:29.720 --> 2:51:32.000]  I wasn't even talking about the Sandy Hook thing,
[2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:35.600]  but to me personally,
[2:51:37.320 --> 2:51:40.240]  I just want to say thank you for everything you've done,
[2:51:40.240 --> 2:51:42.280]  because I would listen to you,
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:44.280]  I had to kind of take you in small doses,
[2:51:44.280 --> 2:51:45.240]  and then I heard, okay,
[2:51:45.240 --> 2:51:48.840]  it's the stuff on COVID made in a lab,
[2:51:48.840 --> 2:51:49.920]  okay, so if that's true,
[2:51:49.920 --> 2:51:51.080]  then that'll come out in the media,
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:52.200]  and then eventually did.
[2:51:52.200 --> 2:51:53.760]  Okay, all this stuff from the vaccines,
[2:51:53.760 --> 2:51:55.880]  and you talking about it with Dr. Malone,
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:51:57.480]  and McCullough, and the rest of them,
[2:51:57.480 --> 2:51:58.800]  and I thought, okay, so if that's true,
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:51:59.840]  that's gonna come out.
[2:51:59.840 --> 2:52:01.560]  And then every single time,
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:04.440]  you've been proven right on really big issues,
[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:06.560]  and then I look at what the mainstream media talks about,
[2:52:06.560 --> 2:52:08.800]  and it's all spin, it's all lies,
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:10.440]  and I just kind of thought, yeah,
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:13.760]  so that quote from Terry and Lannister of,
[2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:15.560]  if you just try to silence Alex Jones,
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:18.200]  you're really just kind of proving him right.
[2:52:18.200 --> 2:52:22.880]  You're trying not to allow people to see
[2:52:22.880 --> 2:52:25.240]  that what you were saying was right,
[2:52:25.240 --> 2:52:26.880]  and it was a truth,
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:28.240]  and that, I mean, because you can say
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:30.640]  that the sun is gonna come up at 8.05 tomorrow morning,
[2:52:30.640 --> 2:52:32.440]  and you could be right about that.
[2:52:32.440 --> 2:52:34.760]  But if you're trying to tell people,
[2:52:34.760 --> 2:52:36.000]  hey, this is what's going on,
[2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:36.840]  here's what's in the,
[2:52:36.840 --> 2:52:39.520]  here's his document that I have,
[2:52:39.520 --> 2:52:41.360]  here's this person that I'm talking to,
[2:52:41.360 --> 2:52:43.440]  we're not trying to lie to you
[2:52:43.440 --> 2:52:45.120]  just to try to be sensationalistic,
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:46.920]  we are telling you the truth.
[2:52:46.920 --> 2:52:47.960]  As far as I'm concerned,
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:49.840]  that's a lot more powerful than just,
[2:52:49.840 --> 2:52:51.000]  you know, Alex Jones was right.
[2:52:51.000 --> 2:52:54.080]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call, brother.
[2:52:54.080 --> 2:52:55.880]  All right, let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma.
[2:52:55.880 --> 2:52:58.680]  Eric, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[2:52:58.680 --> 2:52:59.960]  Mr. Jones.
[2:52:59.960 --> 2:53:01.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:02.280]  Amazing to talk to you,
[2:53:02.280 --> 2:53:04.480]  it's been like a decade or beyond,
[2:53:04.480 --> 2:53:07.880]  I've been in a constant hysterical battle with you.
[2:53:07.880 --> 2:53:10.480]  Bodies is a phenomenal product.
[2:53:10.480 --> 2:53:12.160]  My wife orders it regularly,
[2:53:12.160 --> 2:53:14.640]  and I thank you for not bodies,
[2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:17.920]  maybe some of us with the walk is older age,
[2:53:17.920 --> 2:53:19.600]  so we appreciate you for that.
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:22.680]  The super blue toothpaste is phenomenal.
[2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:25.240]  Makes me wanna brush my teeth
[2:53:25.240 --> 2:53:28.480]  with this COVID era nonsense going on.
[2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:31.040]  Getting to the dentist has been quite a chore,
[2:53:31.040 --> 2:53:33.440]  so I do thank you for that.
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:36.000]  As well as all the other pertinent information
[2:53:36.000 --> 2:53:39.240]  that you've given us about storeable foods,
[2:53:39.240 --> 2:53:41.280]  how to prepare for an emergency,
[2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:42.760]  and things of that nature,
[2:53:42.760 --> 2:53:45.920]  which I have shared with every single being,
[2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.920]  I've come in contact with that on a regular basis,
[2:53:51.640 --> 2:53:52.840]  let's say a daily basis,
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:56.040]  and so we're prepared, which leads me to the reason
[2:53:56.040 --> 2:54:00.040]  that my phone call with the storm in Florida,
[2:54:00.040 --> 2:54:02.600]  one can't think about Alfie Oaks,
[2:54:03.520 --> 2:54:05.600]  those guys down there, hopefully everybody's good.
[2:54:05.600 --> 2:54:06.600]  That's a great point,
[2:54:06.600 --> 2:54:10.080]  because Alfie Oaks was like at the epicenter in Naples.
[2:54:10.080 --> 2:54:12.560]  Guys, get Alfie Oaks on tomorrow.
[2:54:12.560 --> 2:54:13.880]  We got his cell phone number,
[2:54:13.880 --> 2:54:16.560]  let's get Alfie Oaks on, he's a great guy.
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:17.720]  He feeds a lot of people,
[2:54:17.720 --> 2:54:20.080]  and so whatever's going on with the food,
[2:54:20.080 --> 2:54:21.560]  and the supply chain breakdown,
[2:54:21.560 --> 2:54:23.760]  are real things that you're really talking about.
[2:54:23.760 --> 2:54:25.360]  In fact, he wanted to come on a few months ago
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:26.880]  about the supply chain breakdown,
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:27.800]  I meant to get him on.
[2:54:27.800 --> 2:54:30.080]  Alfie Oaks must come on tomorrow,
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:32.280]  or Saturday or Sunday, that's a great point.
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:37.200]  To know that there are people paying attention,
[2:54:37.200 --> 2:54:40.360]  listening very closely for a very long time.
[2:54:40.360 --> 2:54:41.800]  Alex, I love to fight with you,
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:44.080]  I fight with you every day.
[2:54:44.080 --> 2:54:46.600]  It's a challenge to listen to the things that you say,
[2:54:46.600 --> 2:54:48.320]  knowing that they're true,
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:50.960]  wishing that they weren't really true,
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:53.160]  and then trying to not explain this to people
[2:54:53.160 --> 2:54:56.520]  because I don't think anyone can comprehend what's going on.
[2:54:56.520 --> 2:54:58.720]  You cannot explain this to people
[2:54:58.720 --> 2:55:00.360]  in a 10-minute conversation,
[2:55:00.360 --> 2:55:03.400]  and so that's where your faith comes in
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:04.880]  with your higher being,
[2:55:04.880 --> 2:55:09.600]  which kind of brought me to listening to you some time ago.
[2:55:09.600 --> 2:55:11.840]  I think it was through an interview,
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:14.400]  you've done some excellent interviews, in my opinion,
[2:55:14.400 --> 2:55:17.160]  with some very interesting people,
[2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:21.360]  like Louis Farrakhan and others that I don't think
[2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:22.760]  people realize you've done,
[2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:26.120]  that has been so enlightening with information
[2:55:26.120 --> 2:55:28.560]  about Donald Trump and ICE.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:31.880]  Don't think people, this is the conspiracy, right?
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:35.040]  Infowars, this is the conspiratorial channel,
[2:55:35.040 --> 2:55:37.760]  and I don't think people understand it.
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:41.000]  When you say you are at a 5,000 view,
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:46.000]  you looking down into some very giant rabbit holes.
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:49.480]  I mean, you are the tip of the spear
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:52.360]  and the tip of the iceberg on there.
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:53.880]  Well, I'm trying, brother, and I love you, Eric,
[2:55:53.880 --> 2:55:55.080]  and I appreciate your call.
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:57.120]  Chairman, everybody in right now, amazing calls.
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:55:59.240]  Doug, in Oklahoma, last call of the hour,
[2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:00.360]  I'll come back and take a few more.
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:01.200]  Doug, go ahead.
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:05.080]  Alex, great to hear from you.
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:07.840]  Enjoying the book, loving the supplements.
[2:56:07.840 --> 2:56:08.840]  Thank you.
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:11.800]  I love the way that you handle the pencil neck geek
[2:56:11.800 --> 2:56:14.160]  of an attorney over there in Connecticut.
[2:56:14.160 --> 2:56:15.440]  What an idiot.
[2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:18.120]  Oh, well, they've already rigged the jury, it's all rigged.
[2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:19.840]  The good news is, I don't have any money.
[2:56:19.840 --> 2:56:21.040]  They're not getting any money.
[2:56:21.040 --> 2:56:22.360]  Ha, ha, ha!
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:24.400]  That's all big joke on their asses.
[2:56:26.200 --> 2:56:29.120]  Hey, I had a question about the pipeline.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:31.160]  They're saying that it's not being used,
[2:56:31.160 --> 2:56:33.880]  and why is a bunch of gas escaping out of them?
[2:56:33.880 --> 2:56:34.720]  It's not being used.
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:35.560]  That's a good point.
[2:56:35.560 --> 2:56:37.680]  If Nord Stream 2 wasn't open,
[2:56:37.680 --> 2:56:41.360]  why when they blew it up, was it having so much gas through it?
[2:56:41.360 --> 2:56:42.760]  Something that didn't add up.
[2:56:42.760 --> 2:56:44.120]  Of course, nothing ever does.
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:47.320]  Nothing they tell us on the mainstream ever makes anything.
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:48.800]  Maybe Germany opened it up,
[2:56:48.800 --> 2:56:50.880]  and that pissed off NATO, and they blew it up.
[2:56:50.880 --> 2:56:52.800]  Because you know, the same day they blew that up,
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:54.880]  they opened up that new pipeline.
[2:56:54.880 --> 2:56:56.680]  And who owns that pipeline?
[2:56:57.560 --> 2:56:59.480]  That's a good question.
[2:56:59.480 --> 2:57:01.600]  I would like to know who owns that.
[2:57:01.600 --> 2:57:04.360]  That's probably the United States owns that, huh?
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:05.640]  That's why I love taking calls.
[2:57:05.640 --> 2:57:06.680]  I didn't think of that.
[2:57:06.680 --> 2:57:09.400]  If Nord Stream 2 was closed, never opened,
[2:57:09.400 --> 2:57:10.400]  didn't have gas in it,
[2:57:10.400 --> 2:57:12.400]  why when it blew up, did it have gas in it?
[2:57:12.400 --> 2:57:14.120]  Wow!
[2:57:14.120 --> 2:57:16.200]  Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[2:57:16.200 --> 2:57:18.280]  Like I said, nothing they say makes sense.
[2:57:18.280 --> 2:57:20.480]  We gotta put a headline out asking that question.
[2:57:20.480 --> 2:57:22.880]  If Nord Stream 2 didn't have gas in it,
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:25.440]  why when it blew up, did it have all that gas in it?
[2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:27.560]  That, wow.
[2:57:28.800 --> 2:57:30.760]  This doesn't make any sense.
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:33.120]  Again, nothing they say does.
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:34.640]  Keep up the fight, Alex.
[2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:36.080]  Appreciate it, man.
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:37.120]  Appreciate you, Doug.
[2:57:37.120 --> 2:57:40.040]  Final segment at Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:42.080]  Dustin and Austin, back in two minutes,
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:43.480]  going right to your calls.
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:48.560]  Look around you.
[2:57:48.560 --> 2:57:51.480]  Everything I predicted from the Globalistone documents
[2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:53.600]  from their own admissions is now happening.
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:57:55.360]  Infowars credibility.
[2:57:55.360 --> 2:57:57.560]  My credibility has never been higher.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:57:59.960]  And it's because of your backing of this operation
[2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:03.080]  that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:05.120]  and the boycotts and the attacks
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:06.880]  and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[2:58:06.880 --> 2:58:10.280]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:12.520]  in the fight together.
[2:58:12.520 --> 2:58:14.720]  So I wanna ask all of you today
[2:58:14.720 --> 2:58:16.960]  to help keep me on the air.
[2:58:16.960 --> 2:58:18.120]  In my decades on air,
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:20.120]  I've never asked for personal donations.
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:22.080]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:24.000]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:26.360]  and I can't fund those myself.
[2:58:26.360 --> 2:58:27.640]  It's unsustainable.
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:31.920]  So please, visit saveinfowars.com.
[2:58:31.920 --> 2:58:34.240]  Saveinfowars.com where you can make
[2:58:34.240 --> 2:58:37.160]  straight donations, five, 10, $50, $100,
[2:58:37.160 --> 2:58:40.040]  whatever you can so that I can continue to persevere.
[2:58:40.040 --> 2:58:41.920]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in,
[2:58:41.920 --> 2:58:43.000]  but I could give out.
[2:58:43.000 --> 2:58:44.320]  Thank you for your support.
[2:58:44.320 --> 2:58:45.400]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[2:58:50.600 --> 2:58:54.200]  and your support, Infowars continues to persevere
[2:58:54.200 --> 2:58:56.360]  against the attacks never before seen
[2:58:56.360 --> 2:58:58.560]  in the Western world against independent media.
[2:58:58.560 --> 2:59:00.240]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[2:59:00.240 --> 2:59:02.240]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[2:59:02.240 --> 2:59:03.640]  You have stepped on the plate.
[2:59:03.640 --> 2:59:06.480]  So many times and kept Infowars in free speech
[2:59:06.480 --> 2:59:07.920]  on the air and I thank you.
[2:59:07.920 --> 2:59:10.200]  But now I have my own legal bills
[2:59:10.200 --> 2:59:12.440]  that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[2:59:12.440 --> 2:59:13.640]  Now I need your support.
[2:59:13.640 --> 2:59:16.600]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:19.160]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalist,
[2:59:19.160 --> 2:59:23.080]  please visit saveinfowars.com.
[2:59:23.080 --> 2:59:27.000]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go
[2:59:27.000 --> 2:59:30.120]  for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[2:59:30.120 --> 2:59:32.320]  This whole phase of their attacks,
[2:59:32.320 --> 2:59:34.640]  four years in the making is almost over.
[2:59:34.640 --> 2:59:36.760]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.
[2:59:36.760 --> 2:59:38.840]  We're not giving in, but we could give out.
[2:59:38.840 --> 2:59:41.120]  So please, if you support what we're doing
[2:59:41.120 --> 2:59:42.680]  and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:46.600]  in just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:52.200]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:59:52.200 --> 3:00:04.920]  you are the resistance.
[3:00:04.920 --> 3:00:06.280]  I'm no stranger.
[3:00:06.280 --> 3:00:10.560]  No stranger to the rain.
[3:00:10.560 --> 3:00:12.920]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[3:00:12.920 --> 3:00:17.920]  Friend, is it any wonder a lightning strike?
[3:00:17.920 --> 3:00:21.120]  I fought with the devil.
[3:00:21.120 --> 3:00:23.800]  I fought with the devil.
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:26.520]  Got down on his level.
[3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:28.040]  But I never gave in.
[3:00:28.040 --> 3:00:30.880]  So he gave in for me.
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:33.760]  Definitely fought with the devil.
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:37.520]  Only one because of God.
[3:00:37.520 --> 3:00:40.720]  I thought bad weather, but I'm good at fighting.
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:43.960]  You don't need me to spot the bad weather for you.
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:45.880]  You got to come together, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:00:45.880 --> 3:00:48.160]  Got to turn against our differences
[3:00:48.160 --> 3:00:52.400]  and join together under God.
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:57.720]  But through it all, I was stood the pain.
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:01:00.640]  I'm no stranger.
[3:01:00.640 --> 3:01:04.040]  Two final calls before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:06.480]  Dustin in Florida, thanks for holding.
[3:01:06.480 --> 3:01:09.680]  Where are you at and how's it going?
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:11.560]  I'm in Naples, Florida, man.
[3:01:11.560 --> 3:01:15.160]  We got hit pretty good here by that hurtful game.
[3:01:15.160 --> 3:01:16.320]  Yeah, you were right in the epicenter.
[3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:18.960]  You got cream, what's going on?
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:20.600]  Oh, yeah, man, power's still out.
[3:01:20.600 --> 3:01:22.200]  Barely getting a phone call through.
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:23.960]  No data whatsoever.
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:27.480]  No stores open, no gas, no ice.
[3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:30.760]  So it's pretty bad.
[3:01:30.760 --> 3:01:34.200]  Trees down, branches broken everywhere.
[3:01:34.200 --> 3:01:36.720]  And it just made me realize how important all that.
[3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:39.760]  Everything you sell is very important to have.
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:45.800]  Because if you don't have it, you're in some trouble.
[3:01:45.800 --> 3:01:49.560]  What else has happened to the hurricane, brother?
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:01:52.120]  Yeah, they're cleaning it up pretty good.
[3:01:52.120 --> 3:01:53.680]  But I do have to say one thing.
[3:01:53.680 --> 3:02:01.280]  Pfizer, because I'm at the 999 Vanderbilt Beach Boulevard,
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:03.320]  which is the Pfizer building.
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:07.480]  And it has a concrete parking garage.
[3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:09.920]  So they did save my life, not by the vaccine,
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:12.640]  but by the bridge or by the parking garage.
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:15.600]  So I parked here and rode that thing out, man.
[3:02:15.600 --> 3:02:19.800]  It was pretty wild, really wild.
[3:02:19.800 --> 3:02:23.520]  We're glad you're alive, brother, saying hundreds of dead.
[3:02:23.520 --> 3:02:26.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's very sad.
[3:02:26.160 --> 3:02:31.880]  I'm going to go into town here and go see T-Table Alfio.
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:34.520]  See if he needs some more drivers, because that's what I do.
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:35.840]  I drive a truck.
[3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:39.880]  See if he needs some help over there, you know?
[3:02:39.880 --> 3:02:42.560]  But yeah, that was a bad one.
[3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:43.480]  Absolutely, brother.
[3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:45.160]  We're glad you're OK, Dustin.
[3:02:45.160 --> 3:02:48.320]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:51.800]  No, man, all the storable food and everything like that,
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:53.960]  people really need to get that stuff.
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:55.320]  It's very important.
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:58.920]  If they do, if and when they do shut the grid down
[3:02:58.920 --> 3:03:01.840]  and all the cell phone service, man,
[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:03.840]  you do not realize how important it is.
[3:03:03.840 --> 3:03:04.360]  Oh, absolutely.
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:06.480]  Everything we do is to get our message out
[3:03:06.480 --> 3:03:08.240]  and sell somebody something they need.
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:09.880]  Everything we do is a moral decision.
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:11.440]  If this is quality, you need it.
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:12.920]  If you choose to get it, it's great.
[3:03:12.920 --> 3:03:14.240]  PrepareToday.com.
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:15.840]  Thank you so much, Dustin.
[3:03:15.840 --> 3:03:17.280]  Austin in Tennessee.
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:20.000]  Go ahead, Austin, the final caller.
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.160]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[3:03:21.160 --> 3:03:22.400]  Yes, sir.
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:23.840]  All right, great to talk to you.
[3:03:23.840 --> 3:03:27.240]  God bless you, first-time caller, long-time listener.
[3:03:27.240 --> 3:03:28.720]  Love your products and your book.
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:30.720]  I just wanted to share some advice
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:33.800]  that my father has given me about starting locally
[3:03:33.800 --> 3:03:34.640]  with our research.
[3:03:34.640 --> 3:03:37.160]  We're both big into history.
[3:03:37.160 --> 3:03:39.880]  And that cross-country runner that was featured in an article
[3:03:39.880 --> 3:03:44.400]  on your show from Barlett, Tennessee a week or two ago
[3:03:44.400 --> 3:03:46.320]  was actually from the high school
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:47.960]  that I attended and graduated from.
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:49.600]  And I was a runner there.
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:52.560]  And I will say any runner in that kind of shape
[3:03:52.560 --> 3:03:57.840]  is not going to have a blockage without some cause of it.
[3:03:57.840 --> 3:04:00.520]  So they are still pushing the vaccines pretty hard.
[3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:03.760]  I'm trying to do some research locally with my resources
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:06.640]  to see if he had been vaccinated.
[3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:10.440]  But my daughter's 10 months old, took her for a check-up.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:12.800]  And they were constantly, the pediatrician
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:14.440]  was trying to push the vaccine on her.
[3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:15.400]  So it is still a very hard thing.
[3:04:15.400 --> 3:04:16.240]  I totally forgot.
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:18.720]  The Washington Post wrote an article saying,
[3:04:18.720 --> 3:04:22.240]  secretly inject children without parental consent today.
[3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:24.040]  I mean, this is evil.
[3:04:24.040 --> 3:04:25.080]  It is true evil.
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:28.240]  And my wife and I have had pretty serious conversations
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:30.800]  because she believes big in medicine.
[3:04:30.800 --> 3:04:33.240]  And we've got professionals in the family.
[3:04:33.240 --> 3:04:35.680]  And both of them have recommended not to get it,
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:36.840]  including my own doctor.
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:39.480]  He said, if I had any children, I would not inject them.
[3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:41.640]  I was about to say, tell your wife you're vindicated.
[3:04:41.640 --> 3:04:42.160]  It's all come out.
[3:04:42.160 --> 3:04:42.640]  It's a fraud.
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:43.840]  Sorry I got to cut you loose.
[3:04:43.840 --> 3:04:44.720]  God bless you.
[3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:49.440]  Paul Joseph Watson from England takes over in T-minus 60
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:50.320]  seconds.

[3:06:21.860 --> 3:06:23.420]  in the United Kingdom.
[3:06:23.420 --> 3:06:26.140]  listening to her, Joseph Yatsov.
[3:06:28.700 --> 3:06:33.660]  Hello, everyone. It is the Soviet News Hour, September 29th, 2022.
[3:06:34.220 --> 3:06:38.220]  Wrath of news to cover during the course of the next 60 minutes.
[3:06:38.220 --> 3:06:41.100]  We've got the latest on the pipeline explosion.
[3:06:41.100 --> 3:06:44.300]  Of course, we know only Russia carries out false flags.
[3:06:44.300 --> 3:06:47.900]  There's no possibility whatsoever that anyone else was involved, right?
[3:06:48.540 --> 3:06:49.980]  Well, maybe not. We're going to get into that.
[3:06:49.980 --> 3:06:54.860]  We're going to get into the latest on vaccines, the 100% safe and effective,
[3:06:54.860 --> 3:06:58.140]  jibby jab proving not so 100% safe and effective.
[3:06:58.780 --> 3:07:03.100]  We're going to get into the state of woke policing in the United Kingdom,
[3:07:03.100 --> 3:07:09.180]  their latest intervention into the free speech issue as it relates to big tech social media.
[3:07:09.180 --> 3:07:13.180]  And then what they're actually doing in the real world when it comes to
[3:07:13.180 --> 3:07:15.020]  preying on the general public.
[3:07:15.740 --> 3:07:17.740]  Let's start off with some good news, though,
[3:07:17.740 --> 3:07:22.540]  because God knows there's a lot of bad news to cover in terms of censorship.
[3:07:23.420 --> 3:07:25.260]  Now, I talked about it last week on the show.
[3:07:25.820 --> 3:07:31.020]  PayPal had this new purge of customers, of businesses, of organizations.
[3:07:31.020 --> 3:07:36.700]  They took down the accounts of Toby Young, the Daily Skeptic, the Free Speech Union,
[3:07:36.700 --> 3:07:39.820]  all in one go. Of course, they claimed it was just a coincidence
[3:07:39.820 --> 3:07:41.420]  that they took them all down in one go.
[3:07:41.980 --> 3:07:45.740]  They took down the accounts of parents groups who were highlighting
[3:07:45.740 --> 3:07:50.460]  the massive damage caused by lockdown against children,
[3:07:50.460 --> 3:07:54.220]  their speech patterns being delayed, their learning difficulties accelerating,
[3:07:54.220 --> 3:07:59.500]  symptoms of autism, loneliness, suicide, everything that locked down raw.
[3:07:59.500 --> 3:08:02.300]  They were drawing attention to that. No, you can't monetize that.
[3:08:02.300 --> 3:08:03.580]  You can't fundraise off that.
[3:08:03.580 --> 3:08:07.660]  They were banned gays against groomers, of course, in the United States,
[3:08:08.540 --> 3:08:14.620]  campaigning against drag queens, men in dresses being able to sexualize themselves
[3:08:14.620 --> 3:08:17.500]  in front of toddlers. Can't do that.
[3:08:17.500 --> 3:08:21.260]  They were banned and it created a massive backlash.
[3:08:22.220 --> 3:08:25.660]  Now, of course, the common refrain is, well, PayPal's a private company.
[3:08:25.660 --> 3:08:28.620]  It can do what it want. Well, not in the United Kingdom,
[3:08:29.180 --> 3:08:33.980]  because in the United Kingdom, PayPal is regulated by the financial services regulator,
[3:08:34.700 --> 3:08:41.100]  which state directly in their terms that financial platforms have to treat everybody equally,
[3:08:41.100 --> 3:08:44.380]  no matter their view, no matter their political approach.
[3:08:45.580 --> 3:08:48.300]  Well, with the Daily Skeptic, there's actually been a victory.
[3:08:48.300 --> 3:08:51.420]  We have the headline here out of DailySkeptic.org.
[3:08:51.420 --> 3:08:53.820]  Again, questions asked in Parliament.
[3:08:54.700 --> 3:08:58.300]  You had 42 MPs write a letter to the business secretary,
[3:08:59.020 --> 3:09:02.460]  Reese Mogg, urging him to hold PayPal to account.
[3:09:03.020 --> 3:09:07.180]  Lot of questions actually asked by media outlets and it's finally worked.
[3:09:07.180 --> 3:09:12.860]  We've actually won one. Oh, my God, will all those people who got banned by PayPal years ago,
[3:09:12.860 --> 3:09:18.700]  me included, Alex Jones included, everyone else who got banned years ago by PayPal be reinstated.
[3:09:18.700 --> 3:09:21.900]  Well, we don't want to be reinstated because we don't want to use their service.
[3:09:22.860 --> 3:09:26.060]  Well, as of 5.30 p.m., a couple of evenings ago,
[3:09:27.340 --> 3:09:30.780]  PayPal notified Toby Young that it has restored all three of the accounts
[3:09:30.780 --> 3:09:34.780]  that cancelled a couple of weeks ago, only after massive pressure,
[3:09:34.780 --> 3:09:37.500]  only after questions being asked in Parliament,
[3:09:37.500 --> 3:09:40.620]  only after the government threatening to pass new laws,
[3:09:40.620 --> 3:09:44.220]  because there are actually some good people within the Conservative Party,
[3:09:44.220 --> 3:09:46.700]  within the government in the United Kingdom, believe it or not,
[3:09:47.340 --> 3:09:50.540]  threatening to pass laws that would hold PayPal to account,
[3:09:50.540 --> 3:09:52.860]  and of course, the massive backlash online.
[3:09:53.900 --> 3:09:58.300]  It took that for them to restore the accounts of these organizations
[3:09:58.300 --> 3:10:02.620]  after a week of public pressure, they finally backed down.
[3:10:02.620 --> 3:10:06.620]  Now, of course, it takes them about an hour of public pressure
[3:10:06.620 --> 3:10:10.620]  by pink-haired mobs on Twitter to get someone cancelled on PayPal,
[3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:12.060]  or indeed many other platforms.
[3:10:12.700 --> 3:10:14.860]  They cave immediately whenever that happens,
[3:10:14.860 --> 3:10:17.580]  but it literally took a week of government pressure,
[3:10:17.580 --> 3:10:21.740]  of massive media coverage, of questions being asked in Parliament,
[3:10:21.740 --> 3:10:23.980]  for them to back down, and they did back down.
[3:10:23.980 --> 3:10:26.940]  Now, I'm not sure about Gays Against Groomers,
[3:10:26.940 --> 3:10:28.620]  if they got their account back.
[3:10:28.620 --> 3:10:31.020]  Certainly, Toby Young did, the Free Speech Union did,
[3:10:31.020 --> 3:10:35.660]  it was a victory, but of course, PayPal is a completely unsafe platform.
[3:10:35.660 --> 3:10:38.940]  Nobody should be using it, even if they do restore the accounts,
[3:10:38.940 --> 3:10:40.620]  you should never use it again.
[3:10:40.620 --> 3:10:43.260]  And to his credit, that's exactly what Toby Young has said,
[3:10:43.260 --> 3:10:47.660]  despite the fact that this represented a third of account users,
[3:10:47.660 --> 3:10:50.060]  in terms of the people who were paying their monthly fees
[3:10:50.060 --> 3:10:53.020]  to the Free Speech Union, that income for them was wiped out.
[3:10:53.820 --> 3:10:56.860]  I think he said it was something like £200,000 a year,
[3:10:56.860 --> 3:10:59.900]  wiped out in one go, but he's not going to use them again,
[3:10:59.900 --> 3:11:02.700]  and he's going to continue to push for this new law,
[3:11:02.700 --> 3:11:05.020]  an amendment to a bill already in Parliament,
[3:11:05.820 --> 3:11:10.140]  to make sure that legally PayPal cannot ban people for their political views,
[3:11:10.140 --> 3:11:11.900]  as they continue to do.
[3:11:13.100 --> 3:11:14.300]  That's the good news.
[3:11:14.300 --> 3:11:16.460]  Now, let's get into the bad news.
[3:11:17.420 --> 3:11:18.780]  Reclaim the Net reports,
[3:11:18.780 --> 3:11:22.620]  YouTube says Georgia Maloney family values speech was mistakenly removed.
[3:11:22.620 --> 3:11:26.220]  This actually turns out good news, originally bad news.
[3:11:26.220 --> 3:11:30.380]  Of course, Georgia Maloney being the right-wing Italian candidate
[3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:32.540]  who won the election with her right-wing bloc,
[3:11:32.540 --> 3:11:37.420]  she's set to become Prime Minister within the course of a few weeks or months.
[3:11:37.420 --> 3:11:40.300]  If they approve her, of course, the EU is threatening sanctions,
[3:11:41.260 --> 3:11:45.980]  because, God forbid, the Italian electorate would democratically vote someone into power
[3:11:45.980 --> 3:11:47.260]  that the EU doesn't like.
[3:11:47.260 --> 3:11:47.980]  We can't have that.
[3:11:47.980 --> 3:11:48.860]  They must be punished.
[3:11:48.860 --> 3:11:50.540]  Their citizens must be punished.
[3:11:50.540 --> 3:11:50.940]  Fine.
[3:11:51.900 --> 3:11:53.100]  But she won the election,
[3:11:53.100 --> 3:11:56.220]  and YouTube responded by removing one of her speeches.
[3:11:56.220 --> 3:11:57.820]  Oh, but it was just a mistake.
[3:11:57.820 --> 3:11:59.180]  Reclaim the Net reports,
[3:11:59.180 --> 3:12:03.100]  YouTube removed a video featuring incoming Italian Prime Minister, Georgia Maloney.
[3:12:03.980 --> 3:12:05.420]  The video is of a speech.
[3:12:05.420 --> 3:12:06.540]  You've probably seen it by now.
[3:12:06.540 --> 3:12:07.580]  It went ultra-viral.
[3:12:08.380 --> 3:12:10.700]  She gave it to the 2019 World Congress of Families,
[3:12:10.700 --> 3:12:12.460]  where she focused on family values.
[3:12:12.940 --> 3:12:14.300]  Again, she basically said,
[3:12:14.300 --> 3:12:18.300]  you know, I'm Italian, I'm Christian, I'm a mother, this is my identity.
[3:12:18.300 --> 3:12:20.940]  There's nothing wrong with defending our identity.
[3:12:20.940 --> 3:12:21.980]  Everyone else does it.
[3:12:21.980 --> 3:12:23.580]  This is my nationality.
[3:12:23.580 --> 3:12:25.820]  There's nothing wrong with national identity.
[3:12:25.820 --> 3:12:27.900]  There's nothing wrong with gender identity.
[3:12:27.900 --> 3:12:29.900]  There's nothing wrong with family identity.
[3:12:29.900 --> 3:12:30.780]  We're going to defend it.
[3:12:30.780 --> 3:12:31.260]  Quo.
[3:12:31.980 --> 3:12:35.180]  She said, I can't define myself as Italian, Christian woman, mother.
[3:12:35.660 --> 3:12:39.900]  No, I must be citizen X, genders X, parent one, parent two.
[3:12:39.900 --> 3:12:41.020]  I must be a number.
[3:12:41.900 --> 3:12:44.140]  For pointing out that basic reality,
[3:12:44.140 --> 3:12:47.180]  her speech was deleted, censored by YouTube.
[3:12:47.180 --> 3:12:49.020]  It was only after a backlash again,
[3:12:49.020 --> 3:12:51.580]  and after YouTube was contacted by media outlets,
[3:12:52.140 --> 3:12:54.940]  that they said the video was censored in error.
[3:12:54.940 --> 3:12:56.540]  It wasn't censored in error.
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:13:00.700]  Obviously, probably one screeching, pink-haired moron
[3:13:00.700 --> 3:13:04.940]  complained about it, and it was like, yes, sir, it's gone.
[3:13:04.940 --> 3:13:06.860]  Well, now it's finally being restored.
[3:13:07.420 --> 3:13:10.300]  But then we have this, also a headline out of Reclaim the Net,
[3:13:11.180 --> 3:13:12.700]  or reclaim the net.org.
[3:13:12.700 --> 3:13:15.580]  Twitter hides all videos in search results
[3:13:15.580 --> 3:13:18.220]  for Italy's next Prime Minister, George Washington.
[3:13:18.220 --> 3:13:19.500]  Minister, Georgia Maloney.
[3:13:19.500 --> 3:13:23.660]  Yeah, she may be the next leader of a major European country,
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:25.660]  but if you want to see her speeches on Twitter,
[3:13:25.660 --> 3:13:27.340]  well, you can't because they've hidden them.
[3:13:29.420 --> 3:13:32.700]  Twitter is suppressing video searches for Georgia Maloney.
[3:13:32.700 --> 3:13:35.580]  It was this week elected as Italy's first woman Prime Minister.
[3:13:35.580 --> 3:13:37.500]  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised.
[3:13:37.500 --> 3:13:42.540]  They banned the president of the United States nearly two years ago.
[3:13:42.540 --> 3:13:43.820]  Why am I even surprised?
[3:13:44.540 --> 3:13:47.180]  At the time of writing, when Twitter users type her name
[3:13:47.180 --> 3:13:49.500]  in the search bar and choose videos, no results come up.
[3:13:49.500 --> 3:13:51.500]  An archive of the search captured the censorship.
[3:13:52.300 --> 3:13:54.460]  And I tested this about half an hour ago.
[3:13:55.340 --> 3:13:57.180]  You can search for her on the top searches.
[3:13:57.180 --> 3:14:00.140]  If you search for her on the video tab, nothing comes up.
[3:14:00.140 --> 3:14:03.820]  You can't watch any of her videos on Twitter via that search method.
[3:14:05.420 --> 3:14:09.340]  YouTube censors another CPAC video gives the channel a strike.
[3:14:09.340 --> 3:14:13.020]  So this was, of course, the Conservative Political Action Conference.
[3:14:13.020 --> 3:14:14.540]  They had an event in Texas.
[3:14:14.540 --> 3:14:17.020]  They had Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz,
[3:14:17.020 --> 3:14:19.340]  Jim Jordan, and others making speeches.
[3:14:19.900 --> 3:14:20.700]  Can't do that.
[3:14:20.700 --> 3:14:24.860]  This video was removed for violating the platform's policy on misinformation.
[3:14:24.860 --> 3:14:27.980]  So they've got a strike now so they could be permanently banned.
[3:14:29.020 --> 3:14:32.140]  Communication platform, front D platforms, the Babylon B.
[3:14:32.860 --> 3:14:37.020]  Plus the Babylon B was basically D platform by Twitter back in March.
[3:14:37.020 --> 3:14:38.620]  They still have an account there technically,
[3:14:38.620 --> 3:14:41.340]  but they refused to delete their offending tweet.
[3:14:41.340 --> 3:14:43.900]  Which I think was some kind of transgender joke.
[3:14:43.900 --> 3:14:44.620]  God forbid.
[3:14:44.620 --> 3:14:48.300]  And now they've been D platformed by their male provider.
[3:14:49.420 --> 3:14:52.540]  And that male provider is called front.
[3:14:52.540 --> 3:14:53.580]  Don't use front.
[3:14:53.580 --> 3:14:55.180]  It's an unsafe platform.
[3:14:56.060 --> 3:14:59.980]  Babylon B political satire website announced its internal email service provider
[3:14:59.980 --> 3:15:02.460]  withdrew its services without explanation.
[3:15:02.460 --> 3:15:03.900]  That's an unsafe platform.
[3:15:03.900 --> 3:15:07.340]  Of course, the only benefit of male service providers,
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:08.860]  mass email service providers,
[3:15:08.860 --> 3:15:11.580]  is you can just download the email list and switch it to another.
[3:15:11.580 --> 3:15:16.220]  Can't do that with things like PayPal really very easily.
[3:15:17.260 --> 3:15:20.940]  Kofi unpublishers page of UK women's rights group.
[3:15:20.940 --> 3:15:24.540]  You can't argue for women having their own spaces within locker rooms,
[3:15:24.540 --> 3:15:26.700]  shower rooms without men in dresses,
[3:15:26.700 --> 3:15:28.620]  showing their cock and balls in public.
[3:15:28.620 --> 3:15:29.340]  That's bad.
[3:15:29.340 --> 3:15:30.460]  You're an extremist.
[3:15:30.460 --> 3:15:31.420]  Can't have that.
[3:15:31.420 --> 3:15:34.060]  Conservatives will admit for women a UK campaign group
[3:15:34.060 --> 3:15:35.660]  that works to raise awareness of issues
[3:15:35.660 --> 3:15:38.300]  which that and the safety and dignity of women
[3:15:38.300 --> 3:15:43.260]  has had the page it uses to accept donations unpublished by the donation membership platform.
[3:15:43.260 --> 3:15:47.740]  Kofi, Kofi is an unsafe platform to accept any donations.
[3:15:47.740 --> 3:15:49.420]  Cancel your account right now.

[3:16:46.700 --> 3:16:48.300]  Plus it funds the info war.
[3:16:48.300 --> 3:16:49.500]  Thank you for your support.
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:52.540]  The only way you lose is not going to infowarstore.com
[3:16:52.540 --> 3:16:55.340]  and getting 40 to 50% off on all these amazing products.
[3:16:56.940 --> 3:17:01.100]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with a globalist.
[3:17:01.820 --> 3:17:05.740]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[3:17:05.740 --> 3:17:07.580]  not just in America, but in the world.
[3:17:08.300 --> 3:17:11.740]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range
[3:17:11.740 --> 3:17:12.860]  in the information war.
[3:17:13.420 --> 3:17:15.100]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[3:17:15.100 --> 3:17:16.540]  Yes, I've persevered.
[3:17:16.540 --> 3:17:19.500]  But the listeners and viewers who support info wars
[3:17:19.500 --> 3:17:21.580]  are the real reason we've had this success.
[3:17:22.300 --> 3:17:24.540]  We're having now the greatest victories
[3:17:24.540 --> 3:17:27.740]  in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[3:17:27.740 --> 3:17:32.060]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[3:17:32.060 --> 3:17:35.100]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[3:17:35.100 --> 3:17:37.260]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[3:17:37.260 --> 3:17:39.900]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out
[3:17:39.900 --> 3:17:41.260]  and to intensify them.
[3:17:41.260 --> 3:17:42.620]  God bless you all.
[3:17:42.620 --> 3:17:43.660]  I salute you.
[3:17:43.660 --> 3:17:44.700]  I thank you.
[3:17:44.700 --> 3:17:47.660]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[3:17:47.660 --> 3:17:50.860]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[3:17:50.860 --> 3:17:52.140]  The fight is my fight.
[3:17:52.140 --> 3:17:52.780]  It's your fight.
[3:17:52.780 --> 3:17:53.500]  It's our fight.
[3:17:53.500 --> 3:17:54.380]  God bless you all.
[3:17:55.500 --> 3:17:59.260]  The biggest sale of 2022 is now live.

[3:18:19.100 --> 3:18:20.940]  your stamina, your health, your energy,
[3:18:20.940 --> 3:18:22.460]  your cells, your immune system,
[3:18:22.460 --> 3:18:24.780]  but to overall give you more energy.
[3:18:24.780 --> 3:18:28.940]  It's the foundation of everything from energy to fertility.

[3:19:14.620 --> 3:19:16.060]  is X3.
[3:19:16.060 --> 3:19:18.780]  All three of the very best types of iodine
[3:19:18.780 --> 3:19:20.220]  that are natural and pure
[3:19:20.220 --> 3:19:23.420]  that actually get into your cells are in X3.
[3:19:23.420 --> 3:19:24.780]  The Deep Earth Crystal iodine
[3:19:24.780 --> 3:19:27.980]  and two other types to maximize full absorption.
[3:19:27.980 --> 3:19:30.060]  This really is the missing link.
[3:19:30.060 --> 3:19:32.060]  X3 sold out for a long time
[3:19:32.060 --> 3:19:36.940]  is finally back in stock available at infowarstore.com
[3:19:36.940 --> 3:19:38.300]  or by calling toll free,
[3:19:38.300 --> 3:19:41.020]  triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[3:19:41.020 --> 3:19:42.460]  Now it takes a few weeks
[3:19:42.460 --> 3:19:44.780]  for this high quality iodine to kick in.
[3:19:44.780 --> 3:19:47.900]  But almost everybody after that feels the effects.
[3:19:47.900 --> 3:19:49.420]  It's not just for your immune system,
[3:19:49.420 --> 3:19:51.660]  but it's for your energy and so much more.
[3:19:51.660 --> 3:20:15.180]  X3 back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:15.180 --> 3:20:18.540]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters,
[3:20:18.540 --> 3:20:24.700]  it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:24.700 --> 3:20:29.180]  Now we have trust in UK police forces across the country
[3:20:29.180 --> 3:20:33.420]  collapsing on a year by year basis because again,
[3:20:33.420 --> 3:20:36.060]  as we've seen to some extent in the United States,
[3:20:36.060 --> 3:20:37.820]  but nowhere near as bad,
[3:20:37.820 --> 3:20:41.020]  they seem to be more concerned with virtue signaling
[3:20:41.020 --> 3:20:42.780]  than policing actual crimes
[3:20:42.780 --> 3:20:44.780]  than catching actual criminals.
[3:20:44.780 --> 3:20:47.020]  We had an article a few days ago,
[3:20:47.020 --> 3:20:48.380]  headline,
[3:20:48.380 --> 3:20:51.420]  major London department store gives up on calling police
[3:20:51.420 --> 3:20:53.260]  to catch shoplifters.
[3:20:53.260 --> 3:20:55.420]  And we're seeing the same kind of mass looting
[3:20:55.420 --> 3:20:57.100]  that you've seen in major cities,
[3:20:57.100 --> 3:20:59.740]  in progressive cities in the United States,
[3:20:59.740 --> 3:21:01.500]  spreading here in the UK too.
[3:21:02.140 --> 3:21:03.660]  Now London department store,
[3:21:03.660 --> 3:21:06.540]  Fortnum and Mason has given up on calling police
[3:21:06.540 --> 3:21:07.740]  to catch shoplifters
[3:21:07.740 --> 3:21:10.460]  and is instead using its own private detectives
[3:21:10.460 --> 3:21:12.220]  to apprehend thieves.
[3:21:13.420 --> 3:21:13.980]  Because again,
[3:21:13.980 --> 3:21:15.820]  they're not responding to the calls.
[3:21:15.820 --> 3:21:18.140]  And if they are, they're turning up an hour later.
[3:21:18.140 --> 3:21:19.820]  They're not investigator.
[3:21:19.820 --> 3:21:23.740]  Between 200,000 and 300,000 shoplifting offenders
[3:21:23.740 --> 3:21:24.940]  go punished every year,
[3:21:24.940 --> 3:21:27.820]  while untold thousands more are never even reported.
[3:21:28.700 --> 3:21:29.980]  And of course they say,
[3:21:29.980 --> 3:21:33.420]  it's because the police have a lack of resources.
[3:21:33.420 --> 3:21:35.820]  We have a situation in major cities in the UK
[3:21:35.820 --> 3:21:39.020]  where car theft has effectively been decriminalized.
[3:21:39.020 --> 3:21:42.060]  They have a 0.5% success rate
[3:21:42.060 --> 3:21:44.140]  in London of solving car thefts
[3:21:44.140 --> 3:21:45.500]  in 2015.
[3:21:45.500 --> 3:21:47.900]  The National Police Chiefs Council
[3:21:47.900 --> 3:21:50.140]  in the United Kingdom said that police officers
[3:21:50.140 --> 3:21:52.700]  would be unable to respond to some burglaries.
[3:21:53.260 --> 3:21:54.460]  And then in 2018,
[3:21:54.460 --> 3:21:56.700]  it was revealed that two thirds of burglaries
[3:21:56.700 --> 3:21:58.860]  are not even investigated.
[3:21:58.860 --> 3:22:01.340]  So they can't investigate real crimes.
[3:22:01.340 --> 3:22:03.660]  Trust in police is collapsing.
[3:22:03.660 --> 3:22:05.660]  But you know what they can investigate?
[3:22:05.660 --> 3:22:10.860]  Mean and naughty words said by members of the general public.
[3:22:10.860 --> 3:22:12.860]  And we have a video about this right now.
[3:22:12.860 --> 3:22:14.860]  I'll come back and talk about it after.
[3:22:14.860 --> 3:22:16.860]  Let's roll the first five minutes of this though.
[3:22:16.860 --> 3:22:19.420]  This is called, This Shocked Even Me.
[3:22:19.420 --> 3:22:23.580]  And this is what is happening while they police mean tweets,
[3:22:23.580 --> 3:22:25.980]  naughty words, crime is exploding,
[3:22:25.980 --> 3:22:27.260]  they can't deal with it.
[3:22:27.260 --> 3:22:30.860]  But they can deal with the public swearing.
[3:22:30.860 --> 3:22:32.860]  Let's roll the clip.
[3:22:34.860 --> 3:22:38.220]  Look, I know I bang on about the state of policing in the UK.
[3:22:38.220 --> 3:22:40.220]  Look, this one's Shocked Even Me.
[3:22:40.220 --> 3:22:41.820]  And this comes courtesy of Crime Barge.
[3:22:41.820 --> 3:22:43.820]  I'll subscribe to their channel in the description.
[3:22:43.820 --> 3:22:47.820]  So this cop sits outside this dude's house for hours,
[3:22:47.820 --> 3:22:49.820]  waiting for him to come home.
[3:22:49.820 --> 3:22:53.820]  Reportedly because he drove past some bullshit sobriety checkpoint without stopping.
[3:22:53.820 --> 3:22:55.820]  Just so he can tell him off like a naughty child
[3:22:55.820 --> 3:22:59.820]  before he demands the guy give his name to which he refuses.
[3:22:59.820 --> 3:23:01.820]  And this happens.
[3:23:01.820 --> 3:23:03.820]  What? Okay, what? 1-4-1-0-4 will come through.
[3:23:03.820 --> 3:23:05.820]  I'll do the robot.
[3:23:05.820 --> 3:23:07.820]  Robert!
[3:23:07.820 --> 3:23:09.820]  What's going on now?
[3:23:09.820 --> 3:23:11.820]  Dickheaded.
[3:23:11.820 --> 3:23:13.820]  Oh no, he referred to him as a dickhead.
[3:23:13.820 --> 3:23:15.820]  Dickheaded.
[3:23:15.820 --> 3:23:17.820]  Robert!
[3:23:17.820 --> 3:23:19.820]  Yes, it is.
[3:23:19.820 --> 3:23:21.820]  On my property.
[3:23:21.820 --> 3:23:23.820]  On my property.
[3:23:23.820 --> 3:23:25.820]  The public can hear.
[3:23:25.820 --> 3:23:27.820]  Stop swearing.
[3:23:27.820 --> 3:23:29.820]  You're on a quiet residential street in what looks like a rural area.
[3:23:29.820 --> 3:23:31.820]  The public order offends that.
[3:23:31.820 --> 3:23:33.820]  Who's upset?
[3:23:33.820 --> 3:23:35.820]  Is there a squirrel in that tree that felt offended
[3:23:35.820 --> 3:23:39.820]  or causing offence by referring to the officer as a dickhead?
[3:23:39.820 --> 3:23:41.820]  Which he is.
[3:23:41.820 --> 3:23:43.820]  Officer Dickhead then proceeds to invade the guy's property
[3:23:43.820 --> 3:23:45.820]  and try to put him under arrest.
[3:23:45.820 --> 3:23:47.820]  Stop swearing.
[3:23:47.820 --> 3:23:49.820]  What?
[3:23:49.820 --> 3:23:51.820]  Get off the property.
[3:23:51.820 --> 3:23:53.820]  Well, you're under arrest.
[3:23:53.820 --> 3:23:55.820]  Come here.
[3:23:55.820 --> 3:23:57.820]  Get off the property now.
[3:23:57.820 --> 3:23:59.820]  You are on my property.
[3:23:59.820 --> 3:24:01.820]  Where? Enough, enough, Robert.
[3:24:01.820 --> 3:24:03.820]  Are you talking to me?
[3:24:03.820 --> 3:24:05.820]  No, he's not.
[3:24:05.820 --> 3:24:07.820]  Charlie, roll me a 2-3-1.
[3:24:07.820 --> 3:24:09.820]  No, he's not.
[3:24:09.820 --> 3:24:11.820]  Get on the floor now.
[3:24:11.820 --> 3:24:13.820]  Oh my God.
[3:24:13.820 --> 3:24:15.820]  Robert, stop the story.
[3:24:15.820 --> 3:24:17.820]  You're under arrest.
[3:24:17.820 --> 3:24:19.820]  Please.
[3:24:19.820 --> 3:24:21.820]  You're assaulting him. Leave him.
[3:24:21.820 --> 3:24:23.820]  You're on our property.
[3:24:23.820 --> 3:24:25.820]  Stop resisting arrest.
[3:24:25.820 --> 3:24:27.820]  What are you arresting him for?
[3:24:27.820 --> 3:24:29.820]  Robert, you're under arrest.
[3:24:29.820 --> 3:24:31.820]  What are you arresting him for?
[3:24:31.820 --> 3:24:33.820]  You are on my property.
[3:24:33.820 --> 3:24:35.820]  Please.
[3:24:35.820 --> 3:24:37.820]  Robert.
[3:24:37.820 --> 3:24:39.820]  Rob.
[3:24:39.820 --> 3:24:41.820]  Just let him do it if that's the case.
[3:24:45.820 --> 3:24:47.820]  What is going on?
[3:24:47.820 --> 3:24:49.820]  Then at some point Officer Dickhead pepper sprays him in the face.
[3:24:49.820 --> 3:24:51.820]  Robert, don't hurt him.
[3:24:51.820 --> 3:24:53.820]  Don't hurt him. Why are you doing this?
[3:24:53.820 --> 3:24:55.820]  Get off now.
[3:24:55.820 --> 3:24:57.820]  And the struggle continues for several minutes longer.
[3:24:57.820 --> 3:24:59.820]  Let me do it.
[3:24:59.820 --> 3:25:03.820]  There's also a swift elbow to the face.
[3:25:03.820 --> 3:25:05.820]  Get off now.
[3:25:05.820 --> 3:25:07.820]  You don't need to do that.
[3:25:09.820 --> 3:25:11.820]  He just elbowed him in the side of the head.
[3:25:11.820 --> 3:25:13.820]  He just wants you off his property.
[3:25:13.820 --> 3:25:15.820]  You're assaulting me.
[3:25:15.820 --> 3:25:17.820]  He's not assaulted yet.
[3:25:17.820 --> 3:25:19.820]  You've assaulted him.
[3:25:19.820 --> 3:25:21.820]  I'm going to...
[3:25:21.820 --> 3:25:23.820]  Call the police.
[3:25:23.820 --> 3:25:25.820]  Be on your back now.
[3:25:25.820 --> 3:25:27.820]  Be on your back.
[3:25:27.820 --> 3:25:29.820]  He's not a terrorist.
[3:25:29.820 --> 3:25:31.820]  Dude then begs for water because of the pepper spray.
[3:25:31.820 --> 3:25:33.820]  Water.
[3:25:33.820 --> 3:25:35.820]  What is this?
[3:25:35.820 --> 3:25:37.820]  What's he actually doing?
[3:25:37.820 --> 3:25:39.820]  What's he actually doing?
[3:25:39.820 --> 3:25:41.820]  What's he actually doing?
[3:25:41.820 --> 3:25:43.820]  What a good thing.
[3:25:43.820 --> 3:25:45.820]  Don't hold up water.
[3:25:45.820 --> 3:25:47.820]  Just keep waiting.
[3:25:47.820 --> 3:25:49.820]  No, no.
[3:25:49.820 --> 3:25:51.820]  He's a copter.
[3:25:51.820 --> 3:25:53.820]  He's a spray.
[3:25:53.820 --> 3:25:55.820]  Don't hold up water.
[3:25:55.820 --> 3:25:57.820]  He's playing.
[3:25:57.820 --> 3:25:59.820]  What are you going to do?
[3:25:59.820 --> 3:26:01.820]  What are you going to do?
[3:26:01.820 --> 3:26:03.820]  That's outrageous.
[3:26:03.820 --> 3:26:05.820]  I've never seen anything like it.
[3:26:05.820 --> 3:26:07.820]  You know we're not criminals.
[3:26:07.820 --> 3:26:09.820]  You know we're not criminals.
[3:26:09.820 --> 3:26:11.820]  Criminals?
[3:26:11.820 --> 3:26:13.820]  Is it really important to go after criminals
[3:26:13.820 --> 3:26:15.820]  when mean words have been spoken?
[3:26:15.820 --> 3:26:17.820]  So he's in handcuffs.
[3:26:17.820 --> 3:26:19.820]  He's been pepper sprayed in the face
[3:26:19.820 --> 3:26:21.820]  for saying a naughty word.
[3:26:23.820 --> 3:26:25.820]  Maybe time to de-escalate now.
[3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:27.820]  No, you know what this situation needs.
[3:26:27.820 --> 3:26:29.820]  More police officers
[3:26:29.820 --> 3:26:31.820]  all in the cavalry.
[3:26:31.820 --> 3:26:33.820]  Seven more police officers
[3:26:33.820 --> 3:26:35.820]  in six more police cars to deal
[3:26:35.820 --> 3:26:37.820]  with this dangerous speech criminal.
[3:26:37.820 --> 3:26:39.820]  I'm another one.
[3:26:41.820 --> 3:26:43.820]  Two, three, four, five, six police officers.
[3:26:43.820 --> 3:26:45.820]  Wow, I can't believe this.
[3:26:49.820 --> 3:26:51.820]  Do you need us?
[3:26:51.820 --> 3:26:53.820]  No, it's fine.
[3:26:53.820 --> 3:26:55.820]  It's real overkill, isn't it?
[3:26:55.820 --> 3:26:57.820]  Well, you can't be too careful.
[3:26:57.820 --> 3:26:59.820]  Someone might say fuck or something.
[3:26:59.820 --> 3:27:01.820]  Better call in the tactical weapons unit
[3:27:01.820 --> 3:27:03.820]  just to be on the safe side.
[3:27:03.820 --> 3:27:05.820]  As Crime Bodge explains,
[3:27:05.820 --> 3:27:07.820]  your man saying the word dickhead
[3:27:07.820 --> 3:27:09.820]  isn't a violation of the law.
[3:27:09.820 --> 3:27:11.820]  There is no blanket prohibition
[3:27:11.820 --> 3:27:13.820]  from five offence under the public order act
[3:27:13.820 --> 3:27:15.820]  which this man is arrested for
[3:27:15.820 --> 3:27:17.820]  is only made out when a person engages
[3:27:17.820 --> 3:27:19.820]  in intentionally threatening
[3:27:19.820 --> 3:27:21.820]  or abusive behaviour,
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:23.820]  likely to cause alarm and distress
[3:27:23.820 --> 3:27:25.820]  to anyone in the vicinity.
[3:27:25.820 --> 3:27:27.820]  Well, it's not exactly the town square here, is it?
[3:27:27.820 --> 3:27:29.820]  Nor is anyone likely to faint in shock
[3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:31.820]  at hearing the word dickhead.
[3:27:31.820 --> 3:27:33.820]  The only person who would
[3:27:33.820 --> 3:27:35.820]  surely must be one.
[3:27:37.820 --> 3:27:39.820]  Now, you can go watch the rest of that video
[3:27:39.820 --> 3:27:41.820]  but basically what happens, he's carted off to prison.
[3:27:41.820 --> 3:27:43.820]  The other officers show up
[3:27:43.820 --> 3:27:45.820]  and start intimidating the wife
[3:27:45.820 --> 3:27:47.820]  because she almost swears
[3:27:47.820 --> 3:27:49.820]  and they're like, oh no!
[3:27:49.820 --> 3:27:51.820]  You'll be in prison with him too,
[3:27:51.820 --> 3:27:53.820]  basically.
[3:27:53.820 --> 3:27:55.820]  And then you look up Cheshire Police,
[3:27:55.820 --> 3:27:57.820]  this police unit that's involved in that.
[3:27:57.820 --> 3:27:59.820]  And they've got
[3:27:59.820 --> 3:28:01.820]  criminal drug gangs,
[3:28:01.820 --> 3:28:03.820]  migrants coming in
[3:28:03.820 --> 3:28:05.820]  and grooming children as young as 10
[3:28:05.820 --> 3:28:07.820]  to deal drugs on the streets
[3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:09.820]  in that area.
[3:28:09.820 --> 3:28:11.820]  They've got knife crime going through the roof
[3:28:11.820 --> 3:28:13.820]  and fewer, much fewer people
[3:28:13.820 --> 3:28:15.820]  are being convicted of knife crime in that area.
[3:28:15.820 --> 3:28:17.820]  They've got all these real crimes going on
[3:28:17.820 --> 3:28:19.820]  and they're literally preying on the public
[3:28:19.820 --> 3:28:21.820]  for swearing and they wonder
[3:28:21.820 --> 3:28:23.820]  why trust in the police has collapsed.
[3:28:23.820 --> 3:28:25.820]  They wonder why criminals
[3:28:25.820 --> 3:28:27.820]  have no respect for the police
[3:28:27.820 --> 3:28:29.820]  and when we come back on the other side,
[3:28:29.820 --> 3:28:31.820]  we're going to talk about another police department,
[3:28:31.820 --> 3:28:33.820]  Essex Police or Sussex Police actually
[3:28:33.820 --> 3:28:35.820]  and what they're doing
[3:28:35.820 --> 3:28:37.820]  to valiantly fight
[3:28:37.820 --> 3:28:39.820]  against dangerous criminals
[3:28:39.820 --> 3:28:41.820]  in this case, by patrolling people's
[3:28:41.820 --> 3:28:43.820]  mean insults against
[3:28:43.820 --> 3:28:45.820]  convicted pedophiles on Twitter.
[3:28:45.820 --> 3:28:47.820]  You won't believe this, we'll come back
[3:28:47.820 --> 3:28:49.820]  and talk about it on the other side.
[3:28:49.820 --> 3:29:15.820]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[3:29:15.820 --> 3:29:19.820]  I have my own legal bills that have reached the point
[3:29:19.820 --> 3:29:21.820]  that I can't pay them and I need your support.
[3:29:21.820 --> 3:29:23.820]  So if you want to keep this operation
[3:29:23.820 --> 3:29:25.820]  moving forward, if you want to back me
[3:29:25.820 --> 3:29:27.820]  in this fight against the globalist,

[3:29:34.820 --> 3:29:37.820]  for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.

[3:29:42.820 --> 3:29:44.820]  and right at the end, we're not giving up,
[3:29:44.820 --> 3:29:46.820]  we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[3:31:57.820 --> 3:31:59.820]  without info wars.
[3:31:59.820 --> 3:32:01.820]  Just take a moment and sit back
[3:32:01.820 --> 3:32:03.820]  and think about all the incredible
[3:32:03.820 --> 3:32:05.820]  guests and callers and stories
[3:32:05.820 --> 3:32:07.820]  we've broken together.
[3:32:07.820 --> 3:32:09.820]  Think about info wars.
[3:32:09.820 --> 3:32:11.820]  Think about how info wars
[3:32:11.820 --> 3:32:13.820]  is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[3:32:13.820 --> 3:32:15.820]  and Bolsonaro and other
[3:32:15.820 --> 3:32:17.820]  foreign leaders like Nigel Farage
[3:32:17.820 --> 3:32:19.820]  as being the main
[3:32:19.820 --> 3:32:21.820]  impetus towards
[3:32:21.820 --> 3:32:23.820]  firing up their main base
[3:32:23.820 --> 3:32:25.820]  to defeat the New World Order.
[3:32:25.820 --> 3:32:27.820]  The only reason
[3:32:27.820 --> 3:32:29.820]  humanity is still in the fight today
[3:32:29.820 --> 3:32:31.820]  is because the viewers
[3:32:31.820 --> 3:32:33.820]  and listeners of this broadcast
[3:32:33.820 --> 3:32:35.820]  have taken action and supported this show.
[3:32:35.820 --> 3:32:37.820]  I don't take the credit.
[3:32:37.820 --> 3:32:39.820]  I give you the credit.
[3:32:39.820 --> 3:32:41.820]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours.
[3:32:41.820 --> 3:32:43.820]  It isn't going to give up.
[3:32:43.820 --> 3:32:45.820]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[3:32:45.820 --> 3:32:47.820]  Please go to saveinfowars.com
[3:32:47.820 --> 3:32:49.820]  today.

[3:32:51.820 --> 3:33:06.820]  for our legal defense fund.
[3:33:21.820 --> 3:33:23.820]  Broadcasting internationally
[3:33:23.820 --> 3:33:25.820]  from the summit.news headquarters
[3:33:25.820 --> 3:33:27.820]  in the United Kingdom.
[3:33:27.820 --> 3:33:29.820]  It's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:33:29.820 --> 3:33:31.820]  So we have major department
[3:33:31.820 --> 3:33:33.820]  stores in London
[3:33:33.820 --> 3:33:35.820]  like Portland and Mason
[3:33:35.820 --> 3:33:37.820]  saying that they quote lost faith in the police.
[3:33:37.820 --> 3:33:39.820]  Just one in six
[3:33:39.820 --> 3:33:41.820]  shotlifting offenses reported
[3:33:41.820 --> 3:33:43.820]  to the police have resulted in a charge.
[3:33:43.820 --> 3:33:45.820]  They're not even bothered
[3:33:45.820 --> 3:33:47.820]  by the police.
[3:33:47.820 --> 3:33:49.820]  They're not even bothered
[3:33:49.820 --> 3:33:51.820]  in a charge.
[3:33:51.820 --> 3:33:53.820]  They're not even bothering to call the police anymore.
[3:33:53.820 --> 3:33:55.820]  300,000 shotlifting offenses
[3:33:55.820 --> 3:33:57.820]  go unpunished every year in the country.
[3:33:57.820 --> 3:33:59.820]  Car theft is effectively being
[3:33:59.820 --> 3:34:01.820]  decriminalized. They've got 0.5%
[3:34:01.820 --> 3:34:03.820]  success rate.
[3:34:03.820 --> 3:34:05.820]  They're telling Brits that they're not
[3:34:05.820 --> 3:34:07.820]  even going to attend burglaries.
[3:34:07.820 --> 3:34:09.820]  Two thirds of burglaries in the country go unsold.
[3:34:09.820 --> 3:34:11.820]  Despite that
[3:34:11.820 --> 3:34:13.820]  they have plenty of resources
[3:34:13.820 --> 3:34:15.820]  to patrol mean words
[3:34:15.820 --> 3:34:17.820]  said by the general public.
[3:34:17.820 --> 3:34:19.820]  Back in June a man was jailed
[3:34:19.820 --> 3:34:21.820]  for 20 weeks for the crime
[3:34:21.820 --> 3:34:23.820]  of posting offensive George Floyd
[3:34:23.820 --> 3:34:25.820]  memes in a private
[3:34:25.820 --> 3:34:27.820]  WhatsApp and Facebook chat group.
[3:34:27.820 --> 3:34:29.820]  In 2017
[3:34:29.820 --> 3:34:31.820]  it was reported that British police had arrested
[3:34:31.820 --> 3:34:33.820]  3,395 people
[3:34:33.820 --> 3:34:35.820]  for offensive online comments
[3:34:35.820 --> 3:34:37.820]  in the space of a year.
[3:34:37.820 --> 3:34:39.820]  And despite the backlash
[3:34:39.820 --> 3:34:41.820]  despite the government
[3:34:41.820 --> 3:34:43.820]  and the police chief union
[3:34:43.820 --> 3:34:45.820]  literally telling them to stop doing this
[3:34:45.820 --> 3:34:47.820]  they just keep doing it.
[3:34:47.820 --> 3:34:49.820]  You saw the video we just played
[3:34:49.820 --> 3:34:51.820]  they prayed upon a man
[3:34:51.820 --> 3:34:53.820]  arrested him for basically calling
[3:34:53.820 --> 3:34:55.820]  the officer a dickhead.
[3:34:55.820 --> 3:34:57.820]  And now we have this
[3:34:57.820 --> 3:34:59.820]  UK police department savage
[3:34:59.820 --> 3:35:01.820]  for defending convicted serial
[3:35:01.820 --> 3:35:03.820]  pedophile against hate.
[3:35:03.820 --> 3:35:05.820]  Yes, we need to protect
[3:35:05.820 --> 3:35:07.820]  the feelings of convicted nonsense.
[3:35:07.820 --> 3:35:09.820]  That's what the police department
[3:35:09.820 --> 3:35:11.820]  is busy doing on social media.
[3:35:11.820 --> 3:35:13.820]  And this is Sussex Police
[3:35:13.820 --> 3:35:15.820]  who responded to posts from
[3:35:15.820 --> 3:35:17.820]  women's rights campaigners
[3:35:17.820 --> 3:35:19.820]  who expressed concerns that the
[3:35:19.820 --> 3:35:21.820]  58 year old transgender pedophile
[3:35:21.820 --> 3:35:23.820]  going by the name of Sally Ann Dixon
[3:35:23.820 --> 3:35:25.820]  could be incarcerated in a woman's prison.
[3:35:25.820 --> 3:35:27.820]  So basically
[3:35:27.820 --> 3:35:29.820]  this convicted nonce who had
[3:35:29.820 --> 3:35:31.820]  committed 30 indecent assaults
[3:35:31.820 --> 3:35:33.820]  against children from 1989
[3:35:33.820 --> 3:35:35.820]  to 1996.
[3:35:35.820 --> 3:35:37.820]  Seven direct sexual abuse.
[3:35:37.820 --> 3:35:39.820]  I mean it took him what
[3:35:39.820 --> 3:35:41.820]  25 years to catch him
[3:35:41.820 --> 3:35:43.820]  great you finally caught him
[3:35:43.820 --> 3:35:45.820]  after 25 years.
[3:35:45.820 --> 3:35:47.820]  All these crimes committed
[3:35:47.820 --> 3:35:49.820]  while he was a biological male
[3:35:49.820 --> 3:35:51.820]  he's still a biological male by the way
[3:35:51.820 --> 3:35:53.820]  no matter what he calls himself.
[3:35:53.820 --> 3:35:55.820]  So people got on the tweet
[3:35:55.820 --> 3:35:57.820]  Sussex police were celebrating
[3:35:57.820 --> 3:35:59.820]  this conviction which took him
[3:35:59.820 --> 3:36:01.820]  25 friggin years.
[3:36:01.820 --> 3:36:03.820]  They were patting themselves on the back
[3:36:03.820 --> 3:36:05.820]  and people were in the comments
[3:36:05.820 --> 3:36:07.820]  on Twitter saying hang on a minute
[3:36:07.820 --> 3:36:09.820]  why are you calling this person
[3:36:09.820 --> 3:36:11.820]  a woman when it's a man?
[3:36:11.820 --> 3:36:13.820]  When all the crimes were committed
[3:36:13.820 --> 3:36:15.820]  before he said he was a woman
[3:36:15.820 --> 3:36:17.820]  why are you referring to him
[3:36:17.820 --> 3:36:19.820]  as a woman?
[3:36:19.820 --> 3:36:21.820]  Will this individual
[3:36:21.820 --> 3:36:23.820]  this man be put in a women's
[3:36:23.820 --> 3:36:25.820]  prison and will the crime be
[3:36:25.820 --> 3:36:27.820]  reported or recorded as a crime
[3:36:27.820 --> 3:36:29.820]  committed by a woman?
[3:36:29.820 --> 3:36:31.820]  And what was the response from Sussex police
[3:36:31.820 --> 3:36:33.820]  while they said this quote
[3:36:33.820 --> 3:36:35.820]  hi Sussex police did not
[3:36:35.820 --> 3:36:37.820]  tolerate any hateful comments
[3:36:37.820 --> 3:36:39.820]  don't make fun of the nonce
[3:36:39.820 --> 3:36:41.820]  towards their gender identity
[3:36:41.820 --> 3:36:43.820]  regardless of crimes committed.
[3:36:43.820 --> 3:36:45.820]  So this
[3:36:45.820 --> 3:36:47.820]  pedophile literally assaulted
[3:36:47.820 --> 3:36:49.820]  30 kids but regardless of that
[3:36:49.820 --> 3:36:51.820]  don't be mean to him on Twitter
[3:36:51.820 --> 3:36:53.820]  or the police may come after you.
[3:36:53.820 --> 3:36:55.820]  This is the situation we have
[3:36:55.820 --> 3:36:57.820]  in the UK right now.
[3:36:57.820 --> 3:36:59.820]  They want to say this is irrelevant
[3:36:59.820 --> 3:37:01.820]  to the crime that has been committed
[3:37:01.820 --> 3:37:03.820]  and investigated.
[3:37:03.820 --> 3:37:05.820]  Now again after a backlash
[3:37:05.820 --> 3:37:07.820]  there have been plenty of occasions
[3:37:07.820 --> 3:37:09.820]  when they didn't apologise
[3:37:09.820 --> 3:37:11.820]  but in this case they were forced
[3:37:11.820 --> 3:37:13.820]  to apologise because the home secretary
[3:37:13.820 --> 3:37:15.820]  literally had to intervene
[3:37:15.820 --> 3:37:17.820]  and basically said
[3:37:17.820 --> 3:37:19.820]  stop policing pronouns on Twitter
[3:37:19.820 --> 3:37:21.820]  and go catch some real frigging criminals.
[3:37:21.820 --> 3:37:23.820]  So they had to come out
[3:37:23.820 --> 3:37:25.820]  and apologise
[3:37:25.820 --> 3:37:27.820]  but no doubt this is going to happen
[3:37:27.820 --> 3:37:29.820]  again and again and again because
[3:37:29.820 --> 3:37:31.820]  they don't get the message.
[3:37:31.820 --> 3:37:33.820]  Then more information about this police
[3:37:33.820 --> 3:37:35.820]  force that defended convicted
[3:37:35.820 --> 3:37:37.820]  pedophile against hateful comments
[3:37:37.820 --> 3:37:39.820]  and forces gender neutral
[3:37:39.820 --> 3:37:41.820]  warrant cards.
[3:37:41.820 --> 3:37:43.820]  Yes they won't even record their own
[3:37:43.820 --> 3:37:45.820]  employees, their own officers as male
[3:37:45.820 --> 3:37:47.820]  or female anymore.
[3:37:47.820 --> 3:37:49.820]  They give them gender neutral cards
[3:37:49.820 --> 3:37:51.820]  they don't even identify their
[3:37:51.820 --> 3:37:53.820]  actual gender.
[3:37:53.820 --> 3:37:55.820]  The same police force that is patrolling
[3:37:55.820 --> 3:37:57.820]  people's insults towards convicted
[3:37:57.820 --> 3:37:59.820]  pedophiles on Twitter
[3:37:59.820 --> 3:38:01.820]  also faced ridicule in 2017
[3:38:01.820 --> 3:38:03.820]  when one of their sergeants
[3:38:03.820 --> 3:38:05.820]  took to Twitter to warn high street stores
[3:38:05.820 --> 3:38:07.820]  that putting quote,
[3:38:07.820 --> 3:38:09.820]  feminine care signs on women's sanitary
[3:38:09.820 --> 3:38:11.820]  products was transphobic and breached
[3:38:11.820 --> 3:38:13.820]  gender equality rules.
[3:38:13.820 --> 3:38:15.820]  Woke policing is out of control
[3:38:15.820 --> 3:38:17.820]  we've got actual crimes
[3:38:17.820 --> 3:38:19.820]  we've got runaway shoplifting
[3:38:19.820 --> 3:38:21.820]  which is being exacerbated by the cost
[3:38:21.820 --> 3:38:23.820]  of living crisis. They're not interested
[3:38:23.820 --> 3:38:25.820]  in any of it, they complain about lack of resources
[3:38:25.820 --> 3:38:27.820]  where many of their
[3:38:27.820 --> 3:38:29.820]  resources are being spent on patrolling
[3:38:29.820 --> 3:38:31.820]  mean words on social media websites.
[3:38:31.820 --> 3:38:33.820]  It's absolutely
[3:38:33.820 --> 3:38:35.820]  pathetic and a sign
[3:38:35.820 --> 3:38:37.820]  of the increasing managed
[3:38:37.820 --> 3:38:39.820]  decline of the country.
[3:38:39.820 --> 3:38:41.820]  But, it's not
[3:38:41.820 --> 3:38:43.820]  as bad
[3:38:43.820 --> 3:38:45.820]  it's not quite as bad
[3:38:45.820 --> 3:38:47.820]  as what's happening in
[3:38:47.820 --> 3:38:49.820]  Germany. This video is called
[3:38:49.820 --> 3:38:51.820]  You'll Barely Believe This
[3:38:51.820 --> 3:38:53.820]  The Starzy Returns. Let's roll this clip.
[3:38:55.820 --> 3:38:57.820]  I often highlight the chilling examples of how
[3:38:57.820 --> 3:38:59.820]  people in the UK are being harassed,
[3:38:59.820 --> 3:39:01.820]  interrogated and arrested for
[3:39:01.820 --> 3:39:03.820]  offensive speech. But it's nothing
[3:39:03.820 --> 3:39:05.820]  compared to what's happening in Germany.
[3:39:05.820 --> 3:39:07.820]  This shocked even me.
[3:39:07.820 --> 3:39:09.820]  The New York Times revealed the details of treatment
[3:39:09.820 --> 3:39:11.820]  received by thousands of Germans
[3:39:11.820 --> 3:39:13.820]  who have been charged for online speech crimes
[3:39:13.820 --> 3:39:15.820]  since 2018. Reclaim the net
[3:39:15.820 --> 3:39:17.820]  published a great summary of the findings
[3:39:17.820 --> 3:39:19.820]  and what's unfolding in Germany
[3:39:19.820 --> 3:39:21.820]  sounds nightmare-ish.
[3:39:21.820 --> 3:39:23.820]  Regular home police raves of thought
[3:39:23.820 --> 3:39:25.820]  criminals which are filmed by local
[3:39:25.820 --> 3:39:27.820]  TV news stations to publicly
[3:39:27.820 --> 3:39:29.820]  humiliate them. Their cell phones are
[3:39:29.820 --> 3:39:31.820]  seized and then sent to labs to
[3:39:31.820 --> 3:39:33.820]  investigate for further offensive
[3:39:33.820 --> 3:39:35.820]  content. Internet hate speech
[3:39:35.820 --> 3:39:37.820]  investigators who track people down
[3:39:37.820 --> 3:39:39.820]  for infractions, such as comparing
[3:39:39.820 --> 3:39:41.820]  Covid lockdowns to historical acts
[3:39:41.820 --> 3:39:43.820]  of oppression. I tried to find out what
[3:39:43.820 --> 3:39:45.820]  they do in their normal life. One of these
[3:39:45.820 --> 3:39:47.820]  investigators told the Times, if I find where
[3:39:47.820 --> 3:39:49.820]  they live or their relatives then I can get
[3:39:49.820 --> 3:39:51.820]  the real person. The internet has not
[3:39:51.820 --> 3:39:53.820]  forgotten. One man at his home raided for
[3:39:53.820 --> 3:39:55.820]  attributing a quote about immigration
[3:39:55.820 --> 3:39:57.820]  to a German politician.
[3:39:57.820 --> 3:39:59.820]  Yeah, misquoting someone now
[3:39:59.820 --> 3:40:01.820]  apparently makes you a target of the speech
[3:40:01.820 --> 3:40:03.820]  crime stormtroopers.
[3:40:03.820 --> 3:40:05.820]  The accused bears the risk of spreading
[3:40:05.820 --> 3:40:07.820]  a false quote without checking it,
[3:40:07.820 --> 3:40:09.820]  the prosecutors said. Yeah, that's a real
[3:40:09.820 --> 3:40:11.820]  statement. Ever posted a quote
[3:40:11.820 --> 3:40:13.820]  meme and then realized it's not accurate?
[3:40:13.820 --> 3:40:15.820]  Well, if you're in Germany, get ready
[3:40:15.820 --> 3:40:17.820]  for a firm knock on the door. The head of
[3:40:17.820 --> 3:40:19.820]  Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger
[3:40:19.820 --> 3:40:21.820]  Munch, said quote, we are making it clear
[3:40:21.820 --> 3:40:23.820]  that anyone who posts hate messages must
[3:40:23.820 --> 3:40:25.820]  expect the police to be at the front door
[3:40:25.820 --> 3:40:27.820]  afterward. Truly outrageous.
[3:40:27.820 --> 3:40:29.820]  Wouldn't look out of place in the 1930s.
[3:40:29.820 --> 3:40:31.820]  Another Twitter user had their home raided
[3:40:31.820 --> 3:40:33.820]  by six German police officers after
[3:40:33.820 --> 3:40:35.820]  they tweeted, do Bish so want
[3:40:35.820 --> 3:40:37.820]  Pimmel, you are such a penis,
[3:40:37.820 --> 3:40:39.820]  at a city senator who had broken the local
[3:40:39.820 --> 3:40:41.820]  social distancing rules that he was
[3:40:41.820 --> 3:40:43.820]  responsible for enforcing. Another activist
[3:40:43.820 --> 3:40:45.820]  who posted a similar message in response
[3:40:45.820 --> 3:40:47.820]  to a German politician's Facebook post
[3:40:47.820 --> 3:40:49.820]  had his home raided and divisive seized.
[3:40:49.820 --> 3:40:51.820]  They were not here because I'm suspected of
[3:40:51.820 --> 3:40:53.820]  murdering someone. The activist told the
[3:40:53.820 --> 3:40:55.820]  Times, I was just suspected of insulting
[3:40:55.820 --> 3:40:57.820]  someone online. Another anonymous
[3:40:57.820 --> 3:40:59.820]  Twitter user called a journalist stupid
[3:40:59.820 --> 3:41:01.820]  was then unmasked and
[3:41:01.820 --> 3:41:03.820]  fined a thousand euros. Another
[3:41:03.820 --> 3:41:05.820]  individual was fined 10,000 euros
[3:41:05.820 --> 3:41:07.820]  for insulting Turkish immigrants.
[3:41:07.820 --> 3:41:09.820]  And apparently none of this goes far
[3:41:09.820 --> 3:41:11.820]  enough. They're trying to make the hate
[3:41:11.820 --> 3:41:13.820]  speech laws even more draconian.
[3:41:13.820 --> 3:41:15.820]  And what is hate speech? Calling
[3:41:15.820 --> 3:41:17.820]  journalists stupid, highlighting
[3:41:17.820 --> 3:41:19.820]  the hypocrisy of politicians, dissenting
[3:41:19.820 --> 3:41:21.820]  against lockdown policies. It's all
[3:41:21.820 --> 3:41:23.820]  utter bollocks. They call it hate
[3:41:23.820 --> 3:41:25.820]  speech when in reality it's just
[3:41:25.820 --> 3:41:27.820]  criticizing and making fun of people
[3:41:27.820 --> 3:41:29.820]  in authority. That's what hate
[3:41:29.820 --> 3:41:31.820]  speech laws are designed to do. They're
[3:41:31.820 --> 3:41:33.820]  passed on the phony justification of
[3:41:33.820 --> 3:41:35.820]  protecting minorities, when ultimately
[3:41:35.820 --> 3:41:37.820]  they only serve to protect those
[3:41:37.820 --> 3:41:39.820]  in power. Now the German Greens
[3:41:39.820 --> 3:41:41.820]  want to establish reporting centers
[3:41:41.820 --> 3:41:43.820]  for neighbors to snitch on each other
[3:41:43.820 --> 3:41:45.820]  for offensive speech. There's a task
[3:41:45.820 --> 3:41:47.820]  force located in the city of Gottingen.
[3:41:47.820 --> 3:41:49.820]  Their HQ has vast hallways,
[3:41:49.820 --> 3:41:51.820]  bookshelves and desks filled with
[3:41:51.820 --> 3:41:53.820]  red evidence files containing
[3:41:53.820 --> 3:41:55.820]  printouts of German citizens' Facebook
[3:41:55.820 --> 3:41:57.820]  comments, tweets and telegram
[3:41:57.820 --> 3:41:59.820]  posts. We're supposed to be thankful that
[3:41:59.820 --> 3:42:01.820]  the horrendous Stasi era ended
[3:42:01.820 --> 3:42:03.820]  30 years ago. That Germans
[3:42:03.820 --> 3:42:05.820]  are no longer placed under surveillance,
[3:42:05.820 --> 3:42:07.820]  harassed and arrested for things they
[3:42:07.820 --> 3:42:09.820]  say. Yet it's still happening to
[3:42:09.820 --> 3:42:11.820]  this day, only in the name
[3:42:11.820 --> 3:42:13.820]  of political correctness. And never mind
[3:42:13.820 --> 3:42:15.820]  condemning it. Most people don't even
[3:42:15.820 --> 3:42:17.820]  know it's happening. And if they do
[3:42:17.820 --> 3:42:19.820]  they think it's a good thing.
[3:42:23.820 --> 3:42:25.820]  We'll be back
[3:42:25.820 --> 3:42:27.820]  in the next segment with the latest
[3:42:27.820 --> 3:42:29.820]  about the Russian pipeline
[3:42:29.820 --> 3:42:31.820]  explosion. And we're also going to talk
[3:42:31.820 --> 3:42:33.820]  about a new policy by Virgin
[3:42:33.820 --> 3:42:35.820]  Atlantic, where transgender
[3:42:35.820 --> 3:42:37.820]  people at 30,000 feet
[3:42:37.820 --> 3:42:39.820]  while you're traveling 500
[3:42:39.820 --> 3:42:41.820]  miles an hour in a tin can
[3:42:41.820 --> 3:42:43.820]  will be able to wear
[3:42:43.820 --> 3:42:45.820]  dresses. Yes, very important
[3:42:45.820 --> 3:42:47.820]  development. Men will be able
[3:42:47.820 --> 3:42:49.820]  to wear dresses on Virgin Atlantic
[3:42:49.820 --> 3:42:51.820]  Airlines. We'll tell you about it on the other side.
[3:42:51.820 --> 3:43:13.820]  Some of the news don't go away.
[3:43:21.820 --> 3:43:23.820]  In my decades on air, I've never
[3:43:23.820 --> 3:43:25.820]  asked for personal donations, but I've
[3:43:25.820 --> 3:43:27.820]  been forced by the bankruptcy
[3:43:27.820 --> 3:43:29.820]  court to pay for 40% of the legal
[3:43:29.820 --> 3:43:31.820]  fees and I can't fund those
[3:43:31.820 --> 3:43:33.820]  myself. It's unsustainable.

[3:44:55.820 --> 3:44:57.820]  about a world
[3:44:57.820 --> 3:44:59.820]  without info wars.
[3:44:59.820 --> 3:45:01.820]  Just take a moment and sit back
[3:45:01.820 --> 3:45:03.820]  and think about all the incredible
[3:45:03.820 --> 3:45:05.820]  guests and callers and stories we've
[3:45:05.820 --> 3:45:07.820]  broken together. This family that is
[3:45:07.820 --> 3:45:09.820]  info wars.
[3:45:09.820 --> 3:45:11.820]  Think about how info wars is
[3:45:11.820 --> 3:45:13.820]  cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[3:45:13.820 --> 3:45:15.820]  and Bolsonaro and other foreign
[3:45:15.820 --> 3:45:17.820]  leaders like Nigel Farage
[3:45:17.820 --> 3:45:19.820]  as being the main
[3:45:19.820 --> 3:45:21.820]  impetus towards
[3:45:21.820 --> 3:45:23.820]  firing up their main base
[3:45:23.820 --> 3:45:25.820]  to defeat the New World Order.
[3:45:25.820 --> 3:45:27.820]  The only reason humanity
[3:45:27.820 --> 3:45:29.820]  is still in the fight today
[3:45:29.820 --> 3:45:31.820]  is because the viewers and
[3:45:31.820 --> 3:45:33.820]  listeners of this broadcast have taken
[3:45:33.820 --> 3:45:35.820]  action and supported this show.
[3:45:35.820 --> 3:45:37.820]  I don't take the credit.

[3:45:39.820 --> 3:45:41.820]  And now info wars is facing its
[3:45:41.820 --> 3:45:43.820]  darkest hours. It isn't going to give up.

[3:46:17.820 --> 3:46:19.820]  of iodine that are natural and pure
[3:46:19.820 --> 3:46:21.820]  that should get into your cells are in
[3:46:21.820 --> 3:46:23.820]  X3. The deep
[3:46:23.820 --> 3:46:25.820]  crystal iodine and two other types
[3:46:25.820 --> 3:46:27.820]  to maximize full absorption.
[3:46:27.820 --> 3:46:29.820]  This really is the missing link.
[3:46:29.820 --> 3:46:31.820]  X3 sold out for a long time

[3:46:43.820 --> 3:46:45.820]  but almost everybody after that
[3:46:45.820 --> 3:46:47.820]  feels the effects.
[3:46:47.820 --> 3:46:49.820]  It's not a sheer immune system but it's for your energy

[3:46:53.820 --> 3:47:07.820]  50% off.
[3:47:07.820 --> 3:47:09.820]  You're listening to the summit.news
[3:47:09.820 --> 3:47:11.820]  radio hour
[3:47:11.820 --> 3:47:13.820]  with Paul Joseph Watson
[3:47:13.820 --> 3:47:15.820]  Now another aspect of this
[3:47:15.820 --> 3:47:17.820]  well policing crisis
[3:47:17.820 --> 3:47:19.820]  in the UK that I forgot to mention
[3:47:19.820 --> 3:47:21.820]  is this we had
[3:47:21.820 --> 3:47:23.820]  riots over the past few weeks
[3:47:23.820 --> 3:47:25.820]  between Hindu and Muslim groups
[3:47:25.820 --> 3:47:27.820]  in Leicester
[3:47:27.820 --> 3:47:29.820]  a multicultural city
[3:47:29.820 --> 3:47:31.820]  which is very much proving that diversity
[3:47:31.820 --> 3:47:33.820]  isn't a strength
[3:47:33.820 --> 3:47:35.820]  because they've had running battles
[3:47:35.820 --> 3:47:37.820]  with each other over a dispute
[3:47:37.820 --> 3:47:39.820]  apparently over a cricket match
[3:47:39.820 --> 3:47:41.820]  religious sites have been attacked
[3:47:41.820 --> 3:47:43.820]  injuries have occurred
[3:47:43.820 --> 3:47:45.820]  dozens of arrests
[3:47:45.820 --> 3:47:47.820]  police officers attacked
[3:47:47.820 --> 3:47:49.820]  if it was native white people attacking
[3:47:49.820 --> 3:47:51.820]  mosques there'd be national hand wringing
[3:47:51.820 --> 3:47:53.820]  there'd be a moral panic
[3:47:53.820 --> 3:47:55.820]  because it's happening between Muslims and Hindus
[3:47:55.820 --> 3:47:57.820]  in Leicester and we have to pretend that diversity
[3:47:57.820 --> 3:47:59.820]  is a strength
[3:47:59.820 --> 3:48:01.820]  there's basically minimal media coverage
[3:48:01.820 --> 3:48:03.820]  now it's ended completely
[3:48:03.820 --> 3:48:05.820]  but the spectator writer Douglas Murray
[3:48:05.820 --> 3:48:07.820]  penned an article
[3:48:07.820 --> 3:48:09.820]  about these ethnic riots
[3:48:09.820 --> 3:48:11.820]  in Leicester
[3:48:11.820 --> 3:48:13.820]  and he was then confronted on social media
[3:48:13.820 --> 3:48:15.820]  by the police
[3:48:15.820 --> 3:48:17.820]  on Twitter because he wrote
[3:48:17.820 --> 3:48:19.820]  an article about it
[3:48:19.820 --> 3:48:21.820]  again they're more concerned about what people say about it
[3:48:21.820 --> 3:48:23.820]  on Twitter what published bestselling authors
[3:48:23.820 --> 3:48:25.820]  say about it than actually dealing
[3:48:25.820 --> 3:48:27.820]  with it in real life
[3:48:27.820 --> 3:48:29.820]  and he writes in the spectator this week
[3:48:29.820 --> 3:48:31.820]  I'm in trouble with the police
[3:48:31.820 --> 3:48:33.820]  so he wrote an article about these ethnic clashes
[3:48:33.820 --> 3:48:35.820]  between Hindu and Muslim gangs in Leicester
[3:48:35.820 --> 3:48:37.820]  and he basically
[3:48:37.820 --> 3:48:39.820]  made a joke about oh there aren't enough gay cops
[3:48:39.820 --> 3:48:41.820]  there aren't enough transgender cops
[3:48:41.820 --> 3:48:43.820]  dancing the Macarena to deal with this
[3:48:43.820 --> 3:48:45.820]  this prompted a response
[3:48:45.820 --> 3:48:47.820]  from the police
[3:48:47.820 --> 3:48:49.820]  on Twitter because they haven't got anything
[3:48:49.820 --> 3:48:51.820]  frigging more important to do apparently
[3:48:51.820 --> 3:48:53.820]  knife crime
[3:48:53.820 --> 3:48:55.820]  drug gangs forget about it
[3:48:55.820 --> 3:48:57.820]  no what's more important is owning
[3:48:57.820 --> 3:48:59.820]  a published author on Twitter
[3:48:59.820 --> 3:49:01.820]  Sir David Thompson
[3:49:01.820 --> 3:49:03.820]  the chief constable of West Midlands Police
[3:49:03.820 --> 3:49:05.820]  responded to Murray's article
[3:49:05.820 --> 3:49:07.820]  by writing quote
[3:49:07.820 --> 3:49:09.820]  if Mr Murray were to rise
[3:49:09.820 --> 3:49:11.820]  from his comfortable chair
[3:49:11.820 --> 3:49:13.820]  and toddle up to the West Midlands
[3:49:13.820 --> 3:49:15.820]  he found plenty of women and LGBT
[3:49:15.820 --> 3:49:17.820]  officers more than capable
[3:49:17.820 --> 3:49:19.820]  of putting him on his backside
[3:49:19.820 --> 3:49:21.820]  if he came at them waving his shark
[3:49:21.820 --> 3:49:23.820]  found him pen
[3:49:23.820 --> 3:49:25.820]  so basically an underhanded
[3:49:25.820 --> 3:49:27.820]  threat to physically abuse
[3:49:27.820 --> 3:49:29.820]  this published author
[3:49:29.820 --> 3:49:31.820]  because he wrote an article
[3:49:31.820 --> 3:49:33.820]  saying that diversity maybe
[3:49:33.820 --> 3:49:35.820]  isn't a strength when it causes
[3:49:35.820 --> 3:49:37.820]  ethnic riots on the streets
[3:49:37.820 --> 3:49:39.820]  of major UK cities
[3:49:39.820 --> 3:49:41.820]  again more important things
[3:49:41.820 --> 3:49:43.820]  than the knife crime the grooming gangs
[3:49:43.820 --> 3:49:45.820]  the drug gangs more important
[3:49:45.820 --> 3:49:47.820]  is to own Douglas Murray
[3:49:47.820 --> 3:49:49.820]  on Twitter apparently
[3:49:49.820 --> 3:49:51.820]  now let's go to this next video
[3:49:51.820 --> 3:49:53.820]  because on that subject
[3:49:53.820 --> 3:49:55.820]  we have a new prime minister in the United Kingdom
[3:49:55.820 --> 3:49:57.820]  who again
[3:49:57.820 --> 3:49:59.820]  is very much like the old boss
[3:49:59.820 --> 3:50:01.820]  we're not going to see reductions in immigration
[3:50:01.820 --> 3:50:03.820]  we're not going to see
[3:50:03.820 --> 3:50:05.820]  the boat migrants being intercepted
[3:50:05.820 --> 3:50:07.820]  any kind of normal sensible border policy
[3:50:07.820 --> 3:50:09.820]  under Liz Tross
[3:50:09.820 --> 3:50:11.820]  this is called meet the new boss
[3:50:11.820 --> 3:50:13.820]  same as the old boss let's play it
[3:50:13.820 --> 3:50:15.820]  14% of the UK's population
[3:50:15.820 --> 3:50:17.820]  is now foreign born
[3:50:17.820 --> 3:50:19.820]  for decades the equivalent of a medium
[3:50:19.820 --> 3:50:21.820]  sized city in immigrants has been
[3:50:21.820 --> 3:50:23.820]  added to the population every
[3:50:23.820 --> 3:50:25.820]  single year white Brits and our minority
[3:50:25.820 --> 3:50:27.820]  in London the capital of England
[3:50:27.820 --> 3:50:29.820]  we're now seeing violent running street
[3:50:29.820 --> 3:50:31.820]  battles between different ethnic groups
[3:50:31.820 --> 3:50:33.820]  in Leicester the city which has seen its native
[3:50:33.820 --> 3:50:35.820]  population decreased by an average
[3:50:35.820 --> 3:50:37.820]  of 10% every 10 years
[3:50:37.820 --> 3:50:39.820]  grooming gang scandals seem to be never
[3:50:39.820 --> 3:50:41.820]  ending you know what the UK needs
[3:50:41.820 --> 3:50:43.820]  more of though
[3:50:43.820 --> 3:50:45.820]  immigration that's the view of
[3:50:45.820 --> 3:50:47.820]  new conservative prime minister
[3:50:47.820 --> 3:50:49.820]  Liz Tross a woman who completely
[3:50:49.820 --> 3:50:51.820]  ignored the subject of immigration
[3:50:51.820 --> 3:50:53.820]  and boat migrants during the course of her
[3:50:53.820 --> 3:50:55.820]  entire campaign Tross wants to
[3:50:55.820 --> 3:50:57.820]  loosen rules on migrants entering Britain
[3:50:57.820 --> 3:50:59.820]  in order to boost the economy
[3:50:59.820 --> 3:51:01.820]  she also wants to relax the criteria
[3:51:01.820 --> 3:51:03.820]  on migrants having to learn to speak
[3:51:03.820 --> 3:51:05.820]  basic English gotta keep them
[3:51:05.820 --> 3:51:07.820]  GDP numbers up and if it means
[3:51:07.820 --> 3:51:09.820]  sacrificing the identity of the country
[3:51:09.820 --> 3:51:11.820]  so what her own home secretary
[3:51:11.820 --> 3:51:13.820]  is having to beg Tross to maintain
[3:51:13.820 --> 3:51:15.820]  a Tory election promise to cut
[3:51:15.820 --> 3:51:17.820]  immigration levels but should we really
[3:51:17.820 --> 3:51:19.820]  be surprised from the end of the 90s
[3:51:19.820 --> 3:51:21.820]  when the black government set about
[3:51:21.820 --> 3:51:23.820]  imposing a program of deliberate mass
[3:51:23.820 --> 3:51:25.820]  immigration done according to one of his
[3:51:25.820 --> 3:51:27.820]  advisors to rub the rights nose
[3:51:27.820 --> 3:51:29.820]  in diversity and change the electoral
[3:51:29.820 --> 3:51:31.820]  demographic makeup of the country
[3:51:31.820 --> 3:51:33.820]  net immigration to the UK surge
[3:51:33.820 --> 3:51:35.820]  to 349,000 by 2004
[3:51:35.820 --> 3:51:37.820]  it was even higher
[3:51:37.820 --> 3:51:39.820]  in 2015 five years
[3:51:39.820 --> 3:51:41.820]  after the so called conservatives
[3:51:41.820 --> 3:51:43.820]  had been in power at 379,000
[3:51:43.820 --> 3:51:45.820]  in 2020 after the
[3:51:45.820 --> 3:51:47.820]  Brexit vote it was still at
[3:51:47.820 --> 3:51:49.820]  374,000 a year
[3:51:49.820 --> 3:51:51.820]  apparently for Liz Tross
[3:51:51.820 --> 3:51:53.820]  that's not enough we need more just goes
[3:51:53.820 --> 3:51:55.820]  to show doesn't it whoever's in charge
[3:51:55.820 --> 3:51:57.820]  they follow the same policy
[3:51:57.820 --> 3:51:59.820]  and until someone like Nigel Farage forms
[3:51:59.820 --> 3:52:01.820]  an entirely new party predicated
[3:52:01.820 --> 3:52:03.820]  on this key issue of mass
[3:52:03.820 --> 3:52:05.820]  migration forcing the conservatives
[3:52:05.820 --> 3:52:07.820]  to act conservative like
[3:52:07.820 --> 3:52:09.820]  he did with Brexit it's very much a case
[3:52:09.820 --> 3:52:11.820]  of meet the new boss same as
[3:52:11.820 --> 3:52:13.820]  the old boss
[3:52:13.820 --> 3:52:15.820]  now your
[3:52:15.820 --> 3:52:17.820]  report so continues to enjoy the
[3:52:17.820 --> 3:52:19.820]  benefits of mass migration Breitbart
[3:52:19.820 --> 3:52:21.820]  reports migrants from Ukraine engaging
[3:52:21.820 --> 3:52:23.820]  in welfare tourism in Germany
[3:52:23.820 --> 3:52:25.820]  CDU boss there getting
[3:52:25.820 --> 3:52:27.820]  welfare payments upon entering Germany
[3:52:27.820 --> 3:52:29.820]  no questions asked no proof they're
[3:52:29.820 --> 3:52:31.820]  just given handouts by the government
[3:52:31.820 --> 3:52:33.820]  taxpayer funded going
[3:52:33.820 --> 3:52:35.820]  back to Ukraine back to live in Ukraine
[3:52:35.820 --> 3:52:37.820]  then coming back to Germany and picking up
[3:52:37.820 --> 3:52:39.820]  the welfare payments once again we saw
[3:52:39.820 --> 3:52:41.820]  the same thing in Sweden with migrants from
[3:52:41.820 --> 3:52:43.820]  the Middle East and North Africa
[3:52:43.820 --> 3:52:45.820]  where a study has shown that four out of
[3:52:45.820 --> 3:52:47.820]  five refugees who
[3:52:47.820 --> 3:52:49.820]  apparently a fleeing persecution and war
[3:52:49.820 --> 3:52:51.820]  have gone back to holiday
[3:52:51.820 --> 3:52:53.820]  to take vacations in
[3:52:53.820 --> 3:52:55.820]  their countries of origin and then have come
[3:52:55.820 --> 3:52:57.820]  back to Sweden time and time again
[3:52:57.820 --> 3:52:59.820]  back and forth back and forth
[3:52:59.820 --> 3:53:01.820]  they're so persecuted they're so
[3:53:01.820 --> 3:53:03.820]  oppressed they're so war torn
[3:53:03.820 --> 3:53:05.820]  that they keep going home for holidays
[3:53:05.820 --> 3:53:07.820]  interesting that isn't it
[3:53:07.820 --> 3:53:09.820]  want to get to this final video now though
[3:53:09.820 --> 3:53:11.820]  because we have a new policy
[3:53:11.820 --> 3:53:13.820]  announced by Virgin Atlantic
[3:53:13.820 --> 3:53:15.820]  and it's the transgender
[3:53:15.820 --> 3:53:17.820]  friendly uniform policy
[3:53:17.820 --> 3:53:19.820]  let's roll this clip here it is
[3:53:19.820 --> 3:53:21.820]  have you seen Virgin
[3:53:21.820 --> 3:53:23.820]  Atlantic's new promo yeah Virgin
[3:53:23.820 --> 3:53:25.820]  Atlantic just reported losses of
[3:53:25.820 --> 3:53:27.820]  $638 million
[3:53:27.820 --> 3:53:29.820]  and they thought this was the answer
[3:53:51.820 --> 3:53:53.820]  I mean who wouldn't want
[3:53:53.820 --> 3:53:55.820]  to fly with what they're calling the
[3:53:55.820 --> 3:53:57.820]  quote queerest airline don't say
[3:53:57.820 --> 3:53:59.820]  you weren't warned my primary concern
[3:53:59.820 --> 3:54:01.820]  while flying at 500 miles an hour
[3:54:01.820 --> 3:54:03.820]  at 30,000 feet in a metal tube
[3:54:03.820 --> 3:54:05.820]  is that she feels comfortable in day them
[3:54:05.820 --> 3:54:07.820]  tight red dress and heels good morning
[3:54:07.820 --> 3:54:09.820]  this is your captain speaking rumors are that
[3:54:09.820 --> 3:54:11.820]  the entertainment channels on Virgin Atlantic
[3:54:11.820 --> 3:54:13.820]  have been replaced by a looped never
[3:54:13.820 --> 3:54:15.820]  ending video of a drag queen twerking
[3:54:15.820 --> 3:54:17.820]  just move your thumb up and down like that
[3:54:17.820 --> 3:54:19.820]  and that's twerking the updated policies
[3:54:19.820 --> 3:54:21.820]  also provide an option for both Virgin
[3:54:21.820 --> 3:54:23.820]  Atlantic staff and passengers to wear
[3:54:23.820 --> 3:54:25.820]  pronoun badges to make sure they are
[3:54:25.820 --> 3:54:27.820]  addressed with consideration for their gender identity
[3:54:27.820 --> 3:54:29.820]  the airline's ticketing systems will also
[3:54:29.820 --> 3:54:31.820]  allow people with a gender neutral marker
[3:54:31.820 --> 3:54:33.820]  in the passport to use you or X gender
[3:54:33.820 --> 3:54:35.820]  codes on their booking as well as
[3:54:35.820 --> 3:54:37.820]  the gender neutral title meek
[3:54:37.820 --> 3:54:39.820]  when one of the engines fails
[3:54:39.820 --> 3:54:41.820]  and the oxygen mask suddenly drop down
[3:54:41.820 --> 3:54:43.820]  you can sit back safe in the knowledge
[3:54:43.820 --> 3:54:45.820]  that no pronouns have been disrespected
[3:54:45.820 --> 3:54:47.820]  when Islamic hijackers with boxcutters
[3:54:47.820 --> 3:54:49.820]  order everyone to the back of the plane
[3:54:49.820 --> 3:54:51.820]  and relax comforted by the reassurance
[3:54:51.820 --> 3:54:53.820]  that no one has been misgendered
[3:54:53.820 --> 3:54:55.820]  in addition Virgin Atlantic has updated
[3:54:55.820 --> 3:54:57.820]  its trans inclusion policies
[3:54:57.820 --> 3:54:59.820]  entitling members of this community to time
[3:54:59.820 --> 3:55:01.820]  off for medical treatments related
[3:55:01.820 --> 3:55:03.820]  to gender transition and allowing them
[3:55:03.820 --> 3:55:05.820]  to choose changing and shower facilities
[3:55:05.820 --> 3:55:07.820]  what could possibly get wrong after
[3:55:07.820 --> 3:55:09.820]  years of pandemic impact to travel misery
[3:55:09.820 --> 3:55:11.820]  what better way to reconnect
[3:55:11.820 --> 3:55:13.820]  with the average customer than to directly
[3:55:13.820 --> 3:55:15.820]  insert your company into one of the most
[3:55:15.820 --> 3:55:17.820]  polarizing culture war issues ever known
[3:55:17.820 --> 3:55:19.820]  I'm sure that'll go down well
[3:55:19.820 --> 3:55:21.820]  but here in the UK
[3:55:21.820 --> 3:55:23.820]  Virgin Atlantic just ran a months long
[3:55:23.820 --> 3:55:25.820]  TV advertising campaign
[3:55:25.820 --> 3:55:27.820]  celebrating diversity
[3:55:27.820 --> 3:55:29.820]  one notable absence in that commercial
[3:55:29.820 --> 3:55:31.820]  no white men
[3:55:31.820 --> 3:55:33.820]  apparently diversity doesn't include them
[3:55:33.820 --> 3:55:35.820]  hmm wonder if these guys will be on board
[3:55:35.820 --> 3:55:37.820]  for planes flying out of Dubai, Jeddah
[3:55:37.820 --> 3:55:39.820]  and Islamabad
[3:55:39.820 --> 3:55:41.820]  somehow I doubt it
[3:55:43.820 --> 3:55:45.820]  now on that tranny
[3:55:45.820 --> 3:55:47.820]  agenda issue we have
[3:55:47.820 --> 3:55:49.820]  actually a good development in a sense
[3:55:49.820 --> 3:55:51.820]  telegraph reports exclusive trans
[3:55:51.820 --> 3:55:53.820]  charity mermaids to be investigated
[3:55:53.820 --> 3:55:55.820]  by charity commission
[3:55:55.820 --> 3:55:57.820]  this is a taxpayer funded
[3:55:57.820 --> 3:55:59.820]  charity for
[3:55:59.820 --> 3:56:01.820]  transgender youths
[3:56:01.820 --> 3:56:03.820]  which is now being investigated by this
[3:56:03.820 --> 3:56:05.820]  regulatory committee
[3:56:05.820 --> 3:56:07.820]  because it has been found to be sending
[3:56:07.820 --> 3:56:09.820]  potentially dangerous breast
[3:56:09.820 --> 3:56:11.820]  binding devices to children
[3:56:11.820 --> 3:56:13.820]  behind their parents
[3:56:13.820 --> 3:56:15.820]  and backs
[3:56:15.820 --> 3:56:17.820]  and discussing with them how puberty blocking drugs
[3:56:17.820 --> 3:56:19.820]  are totally reversible
[3:56:19.820 --> 3:56:21.820]  so actually good news that they're now being
[3:56:21.820 --> 3:56:23.820]  investigated again
[3:56:23.820 --> 3:56:25.820]  breast binding devices
[3:56:25.820 --> 3:56:27.820]  remember the old foot binding devices
[3:56:27.820 --> 3:56:29.820]  for Chinese women it's basically
[3:56:29.820 --> 3:56:31.820]  physical abuse it's torture
[3:56:31.820 --> 3:56:33.820]  the pipeline issue
[3:56:33.820 --> 3:56:35.820]  is still very hot
[3:56:35.820 --> 3:56:37.820]  no evidence US involved in Nord
[3:56:37.820 --> 3:56:39.820]  stream pipeline attack
[3:56:39.820 --> 3:56:41.820]  because the Pentagon said so and you can believe
[3:56:41.820 --> 3:56:43.820]  them we've investigated ourselves
[3:56:43.820 --> 3:56:45.820]  and found that we did nothing wrong
[3:56:45.820 --> 3:56:47.820]  Russia asked Biden directly if he
[3:56:47.820 --> 3:56:49.820]  carried out his threat to destroy Nord stream
[3:56:49.820 --> 3:56:51.820]  to pipeline also got
[3:56:51.820 --> 3:56:53.820]  German investigators saying that explosive
[3:56:53.820 --> 3:56:55.820]  devices with the equivalent
[3:56:55.820 --> 3:56:57.820]  comparable to 500 kilograms
[3:56:57.820 --> 3:56:59.820]  of TNT
[3:56:59.820 --> 3:57:01.820]  must have been used in that event
[3:57:01.820 --> 3:57:03.820]  of course the narrative
[3:57:03.820 --> 3:57:05.820]  continues to be that it was a Russian false
[3:57:05.820 --> 3:57:07.820]  flag because as we know only Russia
[3:57:07.820 --> 3:57:09.820]  carries out false flags why
[3:57:09.820 --> 3:57:11.820]  they would need to blow up pipelines which
[3:57:11.820 --> 3:57:13.820]  weren't even active weren't even sending
[3:57:13.820 --> 3:57:15.820]  gas to Europe which were their
[3:57:15.820 --> 3:57:17.820]  only leverage over Europe
[3:57:17.820 --> 3:57:19.820]  when they could have attacked the Norwegian
[3:57:19.820 --> 3:57:21.820]  pipeline which was actually sending
[3:57:21.820 --> 3:57:23.820]  gas to Europe and wasn't that far away
[3:57:23.820 --> 3:57:25.820]  remains to be seen but again
[3:57:25.820 --> 3:57:27.820]  the narrative is the evil Russians did it
[3:57:27.820 --> 3:57:29.820]  it was a Russian false flag
[3:57:29.820 --> 3:57:31.820]  don't ask any other questions
[3:57:31.820 --> 3:57:33.820]  it's gonna wrap it up for the show
