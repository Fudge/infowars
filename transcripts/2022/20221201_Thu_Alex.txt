[00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.350]  It's Thursday, December 1st, 2022.
[00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.890]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.251]  And in studio, Ye is our guest.
[00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.732]  He's going to be here, it says, for the next three hours or so.
[00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.372]  And also America's first leader.
[00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:19.574]  And that is Nick Fuentes, Olly Alexander, Owen Schroyer, and many others are also going to be coming through here today.
[00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:27.856]  Ye has arrived in a new ensemble here with us, but I'll assure you it is Ye.
[00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:30.797]  Ye, thank you so much for coming to Austin.
[00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:31.197]  Thank you.
[00:01:31.197 --> 00:01:32.938]  Thank you for having me.
[00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:34.058]  Well, where would you like to start?
[00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:38.680]  This first little five-minute segment is just kind of a prelude to what's coming up.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.241]  What do you want to cover today?
[00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:48.563]  Just God runs the world and Jesus is the way and the life, and it's time to put
[00:01:49.716 --> 00:02:00.359]  Jesus first, and the way that we run our businesses, the way we run our families, our businesses, and the way we run our country.
[00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.580]  Radio listeners, we're on over 400 radio stations, they can't see you right now.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.641]  This is a new look for you.
[00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:09.342]  Oh no, I've been wearing a mask for a while.
[00:02:09.342 --> 00:02:09.682]  Ah.
[00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:10.322]  Yeah.
[00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:13.423]  So this is an archetypal example of the mask is off by putting the mask on?
[00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:18.237]  People can take it how they want to take it.
[00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:35.482]  It's just, you know, it's interesting if you look at a Michael Jordan or something, you load up all these pictures and he's smiling and he's holding a basketball, he's jumping from the free throw line, and then you look at Phil Knight and you barely can see a picture of him and he's got his face covered.
[00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:39.923]  So, I don't have to show my face, it's me.
[00:02:39.923 --> 00:02:42.084]  That's my right.
[00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:42.524]  Absolutely.
[00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:48.883]  That's what Hollywood wants to do, though, is to control everybody through images.
[00:02:48.883 --> 00:02:49.403]  Exactly.
[00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:51.644]  So I'm in control of my image now.
[00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.025]  It's no longer the people that froze my account.
[00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:56.005]  It's no longer the people that threatened me.
[00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:57.746]  We've got past the threats.
[00:02:57.746 --> 00:03:00.786]  They tried to throw me in jail for the truth.
[00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:05.908]  And, you know, people believe me and people see that
[00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:12.172]  I wasn't crazy on what I was talking about, and they tried to write it off, and they keep trying to write it off.
[00:03:12.172 --> 00:03:20.816]  But the truth is, the more and more I'm faithful to Christ, the more and more He's gonna keep on unlocking the blessings.
[00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:28.260]  You know, He set it on my heart to build communities, to build farms, to build schools, to build the choir.
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.121]  But when you do that, you have to be really obedient.
[00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.562]  Hey guys, could you not talk in the back?
[00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:34.623]  I'm like really hypersensitive to sound.
[00:03:34.623 --> 00:03:36.244]  If you guys want to talk, just go into the room, please.
[00:03:37.965 --> 00:03:39.926]  But we have to be really obedient.
[00:03:39.926 --> 00:03:46.671]  You know, like one of the big topics right now is all of the pedophilia advertisement.
[00:03:46.671 --> 00:03:54.276]  And my take on that is, you know, there's one place in the Bible where it says God sees sin differently.
[00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:59.119]  And there's another place where it says, you know, let me get out my phone.
[00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:02.281]  I can like really pull up the exact thing it says in the Bible.
[00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:05.283]  The general gist, and we'll get back to it after the five-minute break, is that
[00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:14.606]  You have to stay strict to everything and remove as much sin as possible in order to serve God.
[00:04:14.606 --> 00:04:30.380]  And when people look at pornography, when a grown man is looking at a grown woman have sex on camera, you're still looking at someone's daughter and you're looking at a lot of times someone that is the product of pedophilia.
[00:04:32.498 --> 00:04:44.104]  So people will engage in going to strip clubs or looking at pornography, but then the moral compass is like, oh my God, look at the pedophiles.
[00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:50.988]  But in a way, anybody who looks at pornography is a form of a pedophile also.
[00:04:50.988 --> 00:04:52.989]  Let's bank it all in.
[00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:53.890]  It's very simple.
[00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.871]  We're not going to be talking about all this moral code and these standards right here.
[00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:00.991]  It's either Christ said so or Christ said no.
[00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:01.291]  Yay!
[00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:02.332]  Powerful information.
[00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:03.192]  I totally agree with you.
[00:05:03.192 --> 00:05:06.072]  Back in 60 seconds to join over 400 radio stations.
[00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:07.373]  Nick Fuentes in the studio.
[00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.713]  Everybody, tell everybody you know, tune in now.
[00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:11.113]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:12.474]  Let's break the internet today.
[00:05:12.474 --> 00:05:14.134]  Stay with us.
[00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:15.114]  Well, make no mistake.
[00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:21.816]  This Thursday, December 1st, 2022 broadcast is beyond the twilight zone because truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:05:21.816 --> 00:05:22.496]  Yay!
[00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:27.177]  Maybe more controversial than Alex Jones or Donald Trump now.
[00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:31.899]  I mean, we're about the most controversial people in the world, and obviously the most attacked and demonized.
[00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:34.841]  He's here, Nick Fuentes is here as well, America first.
[00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.442]  We're going to have Ali Alexander on, Owen Schroer.
[00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:41.984]  This thing's going to go for the next three plus hours, as long as Ye wants to go.
[00:05:41.984 --> 00:05:47.786]  Some stations don't carry the first five, but you just dropped some bombs that I totally agree that are huge, Ye.
[00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:49.347]  So recap that and continue on, sir.
[00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.490]  Okay, so I look this up.
[00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.331]  It's about sin.
[00:05:52.331 --> 00:06:08.965]  That's what we're going to talk about sin today and how we need to do everything that we can where we're imperfect but to flee to free ourselves of sin and repent for sin throughout the day at night and in the morning.
[00:06:08.965 --> 00:06:10.787]  So right here the Bible says right here.
[00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:19.227]  I know I'm gonna do a Corinthians 2, like Trump, you know, new Christian kind of reading of this, so bear with me.
[00:06:19.227 --> 00:06:25.193]  I love Jesus, but I'm not the most, you know, experienced Christian.
[00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:26.834]  And it says, the book of Proverbs
[00:06:28.456 --> 00:06:29.097]  616-19.
[00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:32.300]  I'm sure that's the wrong way to read it.
[00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.541]  It's okay, you got the floor.
[00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:34.242]  Okay.
[00:06:34.242 --> 00:06:40.568]  Identify seven things that God hates, although there are not any punishments prescribed for those.
[00:06:40.568 --> 00:06:47.095]  Scripture clearly indicates that God does view sin differently, and that He proscribed...
[00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:55.457]  He proscribed a different punishment for sin depending upon its severity.
[00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:56.598]  Now watch this one.
[00:06:56.598 --> 00:07:02.759]  It says where the phrase all sins are equal in the eyes of God comes from.
[00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:11.541]  As far as I can tell the most common argument for the belief that all sins are created equal comes from the book of James 2.10.
[00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:12.021]  It states
[00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:21.306]  For whoever keeps the whole law, and yet stumbles at just one point, is guilty of breaking all of it.
[00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:24.208]  Now, I'm a big fan of Steve Jobs.
[00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:29.911]  Even though he did create Apple, and if you notice the logo of Apple is actually the fall of man.
[00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:30.811]  The forbidden fruit.
[00:07:30.811 --> 00:07:31.612]  The bitten apple.
[00:07:32.364 --> 00:07:33.205]  Right?
[00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:38.529]  So we can get into, you know, what social media has done to families and all that.
[00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:40.510]  We got three hours, right?
[00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:54.421]  But I like the way our incredible American inventors like Disney and Hughes and Steve Jobs, the way they ran their companies and invented things that changed the world.
[00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:54.541]  And
[00:07:55.302 --> 00:08:01.228]  The way Steve ran his company was his version of a sinless office.
[00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:08.655]  Everyone had to be so meticulous to be able to take what was 10 things at one time and make and put it in the palm of our hand.
[00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:10.097]  Think about an iPhone.
[00:08:10.097 --> 00:08:11.498]  It's your fax.
[00:08:11.498 --> 00:08:13.500]  It's your email.
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.201]  It's your phone.
[00:08:14.201 --> 00:08:15.222]  And now it's a thousand things.
[00:08:15.342 --> 00:08:16.983]  Yeah, it's your camera.
[00:08:16.983 --> 00:08:19.125]  It's your your flashlight.
[00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:35.236]  Yeah, it's like a thousand things in it, but he had to have his army go in with a sinless approach and right now, you know Gideon call God called Gideon to make an army the 300 the real 300 not the movie version that we're all focused on
[00:08:36.316 --> 00:08:38.177]  Serving this mission at the time.
[00:08:38.177 --> 00:08:50.582]  So we have a mission right now to save our families from social media from Zionist control and bring Jesus Christ back to the forefront and we're protected.
[00:08:50.582 --> 00:08:52.042]  You know, I don't have security.
[00:08:52.042 --> 00:08:53.903]  My security is the angels.
[00:08:53.903 --> 00:09:01.566]  My security is the fact that I didn't load up pornography last night and I said this addiction is going to have to flee from me.
[00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:04.887]  You know this addiction since I was five years old that is destroyed
[00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:23.969]  My my mom and my dad's family that destroyed my family like when I take full accountability for the destruction like of my marriage when I when I I'll point at the liberals and say you took my wife from me you know what took my wife from me the fact that I was married to this beautiful person but it I felt like it wasn't enough I felt like I still
[00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:25.749]  Needed to look at pornography.
[00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:28.690]  In some way, I'd say to her, well stop making these images.
[00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:29.730]  Stop breaking the internet.
[00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:38.932]  You know, that original term comes from my ex-wife actually having a nude photo that I didn't know about that someone used her and put it on a magazine.
[00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:45.053]  But there's somewhere where she's like, well if my husband is looking at this, I still want to be like the girls that are doing this.
[00:09:45.053 --> 00:09:49.253]  And this becomes people reliving the traumas, pushing the addiction.
[00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:51.974]  The pornography industry is not even a big industry.
[00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:52.394]  It's like
[00:09:53.274 --> 00:09:54.895]  Less than 10 billion dollars, right?
[00:09:54.895 --> 00:09:59.156]  So that means that it's not used for prosperity, it's used for disparity.
[00:09:59.156 --> 00:10:11.159]  By the way, George Orwell wrote in 1984, and he'd been the number two guy in PsyOps for OSS, and ran propaganda for the British government, but he found out that he didn't like Hitler, but he found out that they were actually manipulating and created him.
[00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:16.341]  He didn't like the Communists, he'd been one of them, he found out that the British intelligence had actually created that and done that.
[00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:28.070]  And he explained in 1984 that pornography is something to destroy families, destroy our souls, and get us to commit, he wasn't even a big Christian, but get us to debase ourselves so that they can control us.
[00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.333]  Absolutely, you got alcohol and pornography are these legal drugs.
[00:10:32.333 --> 00:10:33.714]  Alcohol is a spirit.
[00:10:33.714 --> 00:10:36.296]  I'm gonna, we're gonna go into the spirit of Alkoole.
[00:10:37.219 --> 00:10:40.100]  Well, let's just go to the facts today.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:46.482]  Let's not just even do opinions, and I love how you brought that in because now you got God's warriors coming together.
[00:10:46.482 --> 00:10:50.843]  Right now, okay, Nick Fuentes doesn't have a Twitter account.
[00:10:50.843 --> 00:10:52.523]  Alex Jones doesn't have a Twitter account.
[00:10:52.523 --> 00:10:53.904]  But hey, guess what, Elon?
[00:10:53.904 --> 00:11:00.266]  I got a Twitter, and today I'm gonna have Nick and Alex tweet from my account.
[00:11:00.266 --> 00:11:01.606]  You like that, Ari Emmanuel?
[00:11:05.174 --> 00:11:06.737]  I'm all about free speech.
[00:11:06.737 --> 00:11:08.461]  And the greatest threat is those that want to silence us.
[00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:10.064]  That's why it comes First Amendment.
[00:11:10.064 --> 00:11:13.490]  Anybody trying to take your speech is the enemy.
[00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.031]  Absolutely.
[00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:23.440]  I do find it a little bit hypocritical that Elon Musk said that he was purchasing Twitter to create a free speech environment.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.641]  He says that free speech is the thing that's going to save the West and our civilization.
[00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:37.763]  But yet, he has taken exception to you, Alex, for some seemingly specific reason, maybe personal to him, but definitely not principled.
[00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:42.084]  So, I think it's time that the people finally demand a real victory here.
[00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:43.765]  We've been at war, essentially.
[00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:52.927]  Since Trump came down the golden escalator seven years ago to put America first, to put Christ first, to free the internet and do these kinds of things.
[00:11:52.927 --> 00:11:58.368]  And here we are all this time later and it seems like we've stagnated or in some ways maybe even taken a step back.
[00:11:58.368 --> 00:12:04.570]  So it's time that people demand we want Christ first, we want America first, we want Alex Jones back on Twitter.
[00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.491]  These are just and reasonable demands.
[00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:18.276]  Well, I see it like this, and I want you to be able to elaborate on this, but I don't want Ye to get his run, because he's got so much to say and he always gets cut off, but I'm going to try to shut up as much, but we can go four or five hours if you want, but the main show's actually four hours long.
[00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:19.317]  I was just hoping for three.
[00:12:19.317 --> 00:12:23.779]  We'll do four hours if you guys are up for it, but here's what I'm saying.
[00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:28.881]  I am a classical liberal at heart, so I love everybody and I judge people by what they do, not what color they are.
[00:12:28.881 --> 00:12:32.683]  And then I look at the things you've said, and some of them, out of context, I don't agree with,
[00:12:33.672 --> 00:12:56.423]  But compared to a liberal, a modern liberal saying white people are inherently evil, and white people are bad because of their skin color, and then that's what the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and these leftist groups in Hollywood have pushed, so they're putting out something beyond even what Hitler said, but reversing it onto white people, and we're supposed to sit there and accept it, and then Ye comes out and says, hey, you know, I see kind of a mafia running things, and then he's the devil.
[00:12:56.423 --> 00:12:58.484]  No, that's bullshit!
[00:12:58.484 --> 00:12:58.764]  Sorry.
[00:13:00.194 --> 00:13:02.355]  Are we going to curse a little bit less on this?
[00:13:02.355 --> 00:13:03.956]  Yes, yes, Reverend.
[00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:04.417]  I'm going to try.
[00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:05.497]  I'll stop.
[00:13:05.497 --> 00:13:14.923]  And the reason I want it, Nick, people have heard from Nick, but people haven't heard from Nick with Ye standing right next to him.
[00:13:14.923 --> 00:13:19.426]  You know, it's like that's the thing that the Zionist control, the 300
[00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:27.855]  In control of the media, in control of the governments, they don't want us to connect to each other.
[00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:34.398]  Like my dad said, okay, they say you're anti-semitic, but they say he's a white supremacist.
[00:13:34.398 --> 00:13:37.219]  And he's asking me, well, what's the difference?
[00:13:37.219 --> 00:13:39.400]  I said, dad, there is no difference.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.701]  It's just separation and confusion.
[00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:48.163]  They want to separate and confuse the Christians and make us afraid to stand next to each other.
[00:13:48.163 --> 00:13:50.765]  A Christian can stand next to anyone.
[00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:51.765]  We can go visit
[00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:53.326]  That's what Jesus did!
[00:14:07.655 --> 00:14:20.069]  Freezing my accounts, smearing me on the media, you know, all of these things, you know, you put on the whole armor of God and they will not be able to break your spirit.
[00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:24.174]  By the way, we can do three hours on this subject and you can do five hours on it.
[00:14:24.874 --> 00:14:34.122]  And let's just get it all going now, because I want to get into everything about your plans to try to bring jobs to America, unifying people, running for president, all those other issues.
[00:14:34.122 --> 00:14:35.264]  So I'm not steering us away from that.
[00:14:35.264 --> 00:14:40.908]  I'm just saying let's just run with it as far as you guys want to go, and then I want to get into all the other topics that surround things.
[00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:41.769]  Oh, beautiful.
[00:14:41.769 --> 00:14:42.990]  So where do you want to start?
[00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.352]  Well, I mean, I would just start with this.
[00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:49.349]  There are good people from every group and every type of culture, and we all know that.
[00:14:49.349 --> 00:14:54.715]  But definitely the left, when it was America that defeated Hitler, calls their opposition Hitler.
[00:14:54.715 --> 00:14:57.998]  When both my grandfathers almost died in the Army Air Corps, both of them almost died.
[00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:01.021]  One of them crash-landed after a mission and got all broke up.
[00:15:01.021 --> 00:15:04.865]  The other one got hit in a German air raid in North Africa.
[00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:12.529]  And he'd only done like 18 of his missions, and then he had a concussion, and he was the captain, and then his buddies went up the next day and blew up over Italy.
[00:15:12.529 --> 00:15:21.074]  He was always freaked out about it, never really talked about it until he died, but when he died we read the letters and all the awards he had and stuff and the things he did after that, and then you know re-upping and recommitting to the Army Air Corps.
[00:15:21.074 --> 00:15:29.980]  So I take it as an offense to have George Soros and people that actually work for Hitler rounding up people, tell me I'm a Nazi when I almost don't exist when my grandfathers went over there.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.481]  I've got a lot to say about this as well.
[00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:35.384]  It's just nuanced with the whole thing that's going on.
[00:15:35.384 --> 00:15:40.528]  But expanding on that, Ye, give us, because I want you to go wherever you want.
[00:15:40.528 --> 00:15:49.074]  So just, let's just have you talk for 10-15 minutes more before me and, me and, we've got a lot to hear from Fuentes and he needs to be heard, but we want to hear from Ye.
[00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:49.335]  Go ahead.
[00:15:49.963 --> 00:16:03.613]  Well, I said with Ali Alexander and Nick Fuentes that we're like the SWAT team of Free Thought, and I go in with this battle ram at the door, and then they come in with these laser beams and have that information.
[00:16:03.613 --> 00:16:05.235]  And we work together as a team.
[00:16:05.235 --> 00:16:10.699]  A lot of times in media, they want to single out one person and burn them to the core.
[00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:15.442]  That is a Zionist approach, and they're asking me to use that same approach.
[00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:19.826]  Well, hey, don't say all people, just say specifically the businessmen.
[00:16:19.826 --> 00:16:24.509]  And then I go on Lex Freeman, and I say who it's specifically, and that's still not enough.
[00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:26.511]  They're still taking it too far.
[00:16:26.511 --> 00:16:36.939]  Everyone knows and agrees now that it's like a reverse version of American History X, the scene when they put the guy's head against the curve and kick the back of it.
[00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:42.970]  And now people are like, wait a second, the so-called crime doesn't deserve the punishment.
[00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:43.992]  What did I thought?
[00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:44.392]  That's right.
[00:16:44.392 --> 00:16:45.655]  You're not Hitler.
[00:16:45.655 --> 00:16:46.797]  You're not a Nazi.
[00:16:46.797 --> 00:16:48.600]  You don't deserve to be called that and demonized.
[00:16:52.098 --> 00:16:55.980]  I see good things about Hitler also.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.122]  I love everyone, and Jewish people are not going to tell me.
[00:16:59.122 --> 00:17:12.050]  You can love us, and you can love what we're doing to you with the contracts, and you can love what we're pushing with the pornography, but this guy that
[00:17:13.064 --> 00:17:17.428]  Invented highways, invented the very microphone that I use as a musician.
[00:17:17.428 --> 00:17:22.633]  You can't say out loud that this person ever did anything good, and I'm done with that.
[00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:24.895]  I'm done with the classifications.
[00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:29.419]  Every human being has something of value that they brought to the table.
[00:17:29.419 --> 00:17:30.820]  Especially Hitler.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:32.101]  How about that one?
[00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:33.783]  Ari Emanuel, how you like that one?
[00:17:33.783 --> 00:17:36.185]  Hey Ron, you gonna do anything to fix Chicago?
[00:17:38.086 --> 00:17:42.709]  Well, I am worried about the thousands of black folks dying a month in Chicago, but let me explain, because that's a nuanced issue.
[00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:48.913]  You know, my grandfather grew up in Dallas from a pretty wealthy family.
[00:17:48.913 --> 00:17:50.474]  Also, Hitler was born Christian.
[00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:55.305]  I've actually studied some of the history on it, but it's very interesting.
[00:17:55.305 --> 00:18:00.208]  My grandfather, you know, grew up and actually some of his family spoke some German.
[00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:01.969]  There's a lot of Germans in Texas.
[00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:09.334]  But did you know that he grew up next door to the inventor of air conditioning and the inventor of one of the major inventors of refrigeration?
[00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:23.866]  And so my issue was growing up my grandfather told me the stories about some of the inside baseball and the things that went on and but later I'm gonna get into that I'm gonna tell you some stuff about Hitler that you might not know directly that happened to my people I knew.
[00:18:23.866 --> 00:18:36.236]  I'd love to hear everything because guess what we don't get to hear it's hidden even like our truth the fact that African-Americans were in America before the Pilgrims that truth is hidden
[00:18:36.696 --> 00:18:40.141]  That we are actually the Native Americans, or some of us are natives.
[00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:47.189]  Or the fact that what Kyrie got in trouble is pointing out that we're Jewish slave boats.
[00:18:47.189 --> 00:18:49.993]  Like, and then... Well, look at Australia.
[00:18:49.993 --> 00:18:52.736]  They've done some of the genetic typing of the Aborigines there.
[00:18:52.736 --> 00:18:53.777]  They're basically Africans.
[00:18:54.434 --> 00:18:55.355]  There you go.
[00:18:55.355 --> 00:19:00.899]  You know, so all of these truths, and then the current truths about banking, about the government.
[00:19:00.899 --> 00:19:08.984]  My favorite thing that I got to say with Tim Pool was Rahm Emanuel was right there next to Obama.
[00:19:08.984 --> 00:19:11.807]  Jared Kushner was right there next to Trump.
[00:19:11.807 --> 00:19:16.150]  What are those two people, those two Zionists, I gave it away, have in common?
[00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:19.540]  Nick, can you pick that up and expound on that?
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.461]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:19:20.461 --> 00:19:30.393]  You know, and it's interesting because you've been going on these interviews with Lex Friedman and with Tim Pool and Piers Morgan, and they always say, well, don't talk about a group, talk about the individuals.
[00:19:30.393 --> 00:19:36.279]  And I want to point out, one, it's hypocritical because in the same interview, Tim Pool said, well, wouldn't EA be so great for the black vote?
[00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:41.525]  You can say the black vote, but you talk about Jewish businessmen, and somehow that's a problem.
[00:19:41.525 --> 00:19:44.226]  You can't talk about groups when it's one but not the other.
[00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:53.952]  The other thing is that there is something baked into the cake in Judaism which affects how they're brokering these kinds of contracts with entertainers like Ye.
[00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:55.694]  If you look at the Talmud, which is a real
[00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:57.115]  We're good to go.
[00:20:15.856 --> 00:20:20.098]  If a Jew indirectly kills a Gentile, there's nothing even wrong with that.
[00:20:20.098 --> 00:20:21.899]  There's nothing morally wrong with that.
[00:20:21.899 --> 00:20:26.302]  They say that for a Jew to have sex with a Gentile is comparable to bestiality.
[00:20:26.302 --> 00:20:30.204]  They say that the semen of a Gentile is like that of horses.
[00:20:30.204 --> 00:20:32.805]  They also say that you can't give a gift to a Gentile.
[00:20:32.805 --> 00:20:37.127]  A Jew is not permitted under the Talmud to give a gift to a Gentile.
[00:20:37.127 --> 00:20:42.010]  They're not permitted to charge each other interest, but they're encouraged to charge Gentiles interest.
[00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.191]  What do they say about pedophilia?
[00:20:43.911 --> 00:20:46.974]  They say that that's, in some cases, less it.
[00:20:46.974 --> 00:20:55.664]  You're telling me, in their holy book, it says it's okay to be pedophiles as long as it's not another Jewish person?
[00:20:55.664 --> 00:20:57.045]  That's only came from Adam.
[00:20:57.045 --> 00:20:57.826]  I'm not 100% sure.
[00:20:57.826 --> 00:21:01.229]  Let me just get this out front.
[00:21:01.229 --> 00:21:02.170]  I believe in free speech.
[00:21:02.991 --> 00:21:03.472]  And that's
[00:21:21.647 --> 00:21:24.748]  You don't want open borders, you don't want your guns taken, or you don't want to take a shot.
[00:21:24.748 --> 00:21:31.991]  The ADL had a meeting last two weeks ago and said, Alex Jones is an agent of evil, he should be taken off the air, he's the devil, because he doesn't want you to take four shots.
[00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:34.192]  And I'm like, what are you doing calling me anti-Semitic?
[00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.553]  I'm not against groups, I don't get into group politics.
[00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:40.995]  Adam, I've got, I mean, sorry, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to say that.
[00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:41.535]  Alex.
[00:21:41.535 --> 00:21:43.076]  Yes, sir.
[00:21:43.076 --> 00:21:47.057]  I've got the perfect answer for the ADL.
[00:21:47.057 --> 00:21:49.098]  They are going to have to listen up.
[00:21:49.813 --> 00:21:56.876]  What we did is we brought Netanyahu with us.
[00:21:56.876 --> 00:22:00.717]  I'm in the twilight zone right now.
[00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:03.278]  Netanyahu, what do you have to say?
[00:22:03.278 --> 00:22:08.940]  What do you have to say to Alex Jones right now, Nick Fuentes, and Ye?
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.120]  It was bad.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.602]  It was bad for Trump to meet with Nick and Ye.
[00:22:14.602 --> 00:22:16.583]  Okay.
[00:22:16.583 --> 00:22:19.444]  I had no idea your voice was going to sound like that, Netanyahu.
[00:22:22.096 --> 00:22:23.378]  So you don't like Benjamin Netanyahu?
[00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:57.339]  I'm glad you guys are here and we can sit here and all I'm telling you is you guys realize that the British government created Hitler and the Milner group put him in power and there's something much more sophisticated and I personally
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:07.063]  I think that most Jews are great people, and I understand there's a Jewish mafia, and they're used to demonize anybody that promotes freedom, but I don't blame Jews in general for that.
[00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:13.605]  And there is a much larger eugenics, transhumanist, scientific elite agenda that's playing off... What about abortion?
[00:23:13.605 --> 00:23:15.666]  It's 50% of black deaths.
[00:23:15.666 --> 00:23:21.748]  There's over 50... Hey, one of the papers I had, you're like, why is it all... You're the director today, it's fine.
[00:23:21.748 --> 00:23:26.490]  The Margaret Singer Rockefeller-founded Planned Parenthood
[00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:34.257]  Came out today and said, because of your white guilt, white people need to give money so we can kill black babies.
[00:23:34.257 --> 00:23:35.578]  I swear to God, it's in my stack.
[00:23:35.578 --> 00:23:38.239]  If you hadn't moved it off the desk, I could pull it right up for you.
[00:23:38.239 --> 00:23:40.040]  Why did I have you move it off the desk, Alex?
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.800]  Because it's cluttered.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.701]  I'm not bitching.
[00:23:41.701 --> 00:23:43.322]  I'm just saying, everybody asks, where's my papers?
[00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:44.662]  I don't have them, they're just a prop.
[00:23:44.662 --> 00:23:46.963]  I could literally go, look, I agree with you.
[00:23:46.963 --> 00:23:47.724]  Look at this.
[00:23:47.724 --> 00:23:51.886]  They say white people help us kill black people for your white guilt.
[00:23:51.886 --> 00:23:54.147]  It actually says that.
[00:23:54.147 --> 00:23:54.307]  Now,
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.181]  This is, I'm agreeing with you.
[00:23:57.181 --> 00:23:58.521]  Is it a problem with props?
[00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:00.763]  We can't, this is the voice of Netanyahu!
[00:24:00.763 --> 00:24:02.463]  See, you get your mop.
[00:24:02.463 --> 00:24:03.264]  You get your mop.
[00:24:03.264 --> 00:24:05.525]  I actually, I'm going to find the tweet here.
[00:24:05.525 --> 00:24:07.106]  See, I'm, because I want to show you this.
[00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:09.227]  This is a big, guys, I sent it to you this morning.
[00:24:09.227 --> 00:24:10.067]  It was, it was in the tweets.
[00:24:10.067 --> 00:24:12.008]  Can you pull it up?
[00:24:12.008 --> 00:24:17.350]  Uh, it's, it's, it's official Twitter of, uh, the eugenics death cult.
[00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.131]  Talk about Nazis.
[00:24:18.131 --> 00:24:20.992]  I mean, we're going to have Netanyahu step out for a second.
[00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:22.073]  Okay, Alex.
[00:24:22.073 --> 00:24:22.473]  Oh, he's going to go?
[00:24:23.343 --> 00:24:29.995]  I'm leaving for now until it's another meeting and then I'm gonna say something.
[00:24:29.995 --> 00:24:31.978]  You're not only an artist, you're a comedian.
[00:24:31.978 --> 00:24:34.582]  But Nick, that's what I'm getting at here is, is that...
[00:24:37.575 --> 00:24:41.659]  Is, is, is that it was a, uh, it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:41.659 --> 00:24:46.163]  I just, I mean, there's, listen, there's fluoride in the water killing us all.
[00:24:46.163 --> 00:24:47.584]  They're injecting us with GMO.
[00:24:47.584 --> 00:24:50.126]  Oh, here's the question, and I'm not, I'm not an apologist for Israel.
[00:24:50.126 --> 00:24:51.107]  I'm trying to be balanced here.
[00:24:51.107 --> 00:24:51.968]  And I believe in First Amendment.
[00:24:51.968 --> 00:24:52.628]  I believe in free speech.
[00:24:52.628 --> 00:24:53.969]  I agree, Dorsey, say whatever you want.
[00:24:54.870 --> 00:25:01.514]  Israel has, other than like Singapore and a few places, the most draconian mRNA injections in the world.
[00:25:01.514 --> 00:25:04.055]  They have the highest death rate from the shots.
[00:25:04.055 --> 00:25:09.979]  They are literally forcibly injecting them, like Joseph Mingala, and Jews are dying en masse in Israel.
[00:25:09.979 --> 00:25:17.223]  So, if the Jews are the secret group that runs it all, and I'm not denying that Jews run Hollywood, what I'm saying is... It's the Zionists!
[00:25:17.223 --> 00:25:22.006]  Okay, well why would the Zionists be killing Jews en masse in Israel with the poison shot?
[00:25:22.759 --> 00:25:25.440]  Because they work for Satan, they don't work for God.
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.080]  Exactly!
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:33.061]  So they create atmospheres that get Jews persecuted, so they can control the Jews, so they can kill them.
[00:25:33.061 --> 00:25:33.962]  And you just did it.
[00:25:33.962 --> 00:25:38.003]  Just like George Soros helped round up Jews for Hitler, that's the next level.
[00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:38.283]  Boom!
[00:25:38.283 --> 00:25:39.363]  We just got there.
[00:25:39.363 --> 00:25:41.183]  And they control the left and the right.
[00:25:41.183 --> 00:25:43.784]  They make politics super messy.
[00:25:43.784 --> 00:25:52.106]  Like, I went in to meet with my boy Trump, and the next thing you know, like he typed, he said, fake news went crazy.
[00:25:53.264 --> 00:25:58.645]  And I love Trump like every other good Christian American.
[00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:04.587]  We just want to hold Trump to Christian values and say, that's the only way to the White House.
[00:26:04.587 --> 00:26:07.228]  And if he doesn't do it, then I'm going to have to do it.
[00:26:07.228 --> 00:26:11.089]  I think that Trump is a more senior president.
[00:26:11.089 --> 00:26:14.550]  I think I've got some growing to do, but I love Jesus.
[00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.290]  It's kind of like David.
[00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:20.892]  All of his brothers had all this battle experience and he was tended to the sheep.
[00:26:20.892 --> 00:26:24.273]  But while he was out there, he had to fight bears and tigers.
[00:26:24.273 --> 00:26:27.654]  This is the little I know as a baby.
[00:26:27.654 --> 00:26:29.555]  But he was able to beat that giant.
[00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:31.076]  And right now this giant, there's a...
[00:26:32.202 --> 00:26:33.222]  There's some cleaning.
[00:26:33.222 --> 00:26:36.243]  There's some plumbing that we have to do.
[00:26:36.243 --> 00:26:53.748]  And that's what I'm doing with my style of art, my style of humor, and who I am as a celebrity to say, okay, I've been messed over enough by Jewish businessmen to get to the point to say, I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:26:53.748 --> 00:26:58.269]  I'm not the first person that got debanked because of their political opinion.
[00:26:58.949 --> 00:27:02.271]  And I represent now the common man.
[00:27:02.271 --> 00:27:07.815]  If we go, when we go, I don't like the word if, when we go into the White House, it's the us now.
[00:27:07.815 --> 00:27:11.938]  It's not about specifically an icon or dissent.
[00:27:11.938 --> 00:27:13.199]  But it's issues.
[00:27:13.199 --> 00:27:16.061]  Yeah, it's about the issues in America.
[00:27:16.061 --> 00:27:16.941]  Yeah, stay there, stay there.
[00:27:16.941 --> 00:27:17.822]  Nick Voigt does the studio.
[00:27:17.822 --> 00:27:19.383]  This is Uncensored, folks.
[00:27:19.383 --> 00:27:21.504]  We're going to come back after this break.
[00:27:21.504 --> 00:27:25.447]  And we're going to come back after the break and play a Jordan Sorrells compilation of him on NPR.
[00:27:25.447 --> 00:27:26.988]  Don't forget about me!
[00:27:26.988 --> 00:27:27.608]  Him on NPR.
[00:27:28.869 --> 00:27:33.412]  And him on 60 Minutes saying the best time of his life was rounding up and killing Jews.
[00:27:33.412 --> 00:27:35.413]  The AA never killed any Jews.
[00:27:35.413 --> 00:27:38.175]  So I want to know, how do I get the ADL to love me?
[00:27:38.175 --> 00:27:40.057]  Do I round up Jews in Nazi Germany?
[00:27:40.057 --> 00:27:40.877]  Do I get love then?
[00:27:40.877 --> 00:27:42.698]  Schwarzenegger said he loved Hitler.
[00:27:42.698 --> 00:27:43.679]  They gave him an award.
[00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:47.621]  I'm just saying, I don't like Nazis and I don't like what some of the mafias are doing either.
[00:27:47.621 --> 00:27:48.202]  I like Hitler.
[00:27:49.375 --> 00:27:55.238]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[00:27:55.238 --> 00:27:57.360]  For me it was a very positive experience.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:06.625]  It's a strange thing, you know, because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself.
[00:28:07.675 --> 00:28:13.277]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe that it can actually touch you.
[00:28:13.277 --> 00:28:16.938]  You have a belief in yourself, your belief in your father.
[00:28:16.938 --> 00:28:21.299]  It's a very happy-making, exhilarating experience.
[00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:32.302]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews.
[00:28:32.902 --> 00:28:38.365]  These are pictures from 1944 of what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors.
[00:28:38.365 --> 00:28:47.311]  You're a Hungarian Jew who escaped the Holocaust by posing as a Christian.
[00:28:47.311 --> 00:28:48.891]  Right.
[00:28:48.891 --> 00:28:51.113]  And you watched
[00:28:53.263 --> 00:28:55.365]  Lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:56.205]  Right.
[00:28:56.205 --> 00:28:58.227]  I was 14 years old.
[00:28:58.227 --> 00:29:01.209]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:29:01.209 --> 00:29:02.150]  In what way?
[00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:08.435]  That one should think ahead, one should understand and anticipate events.
[00:29:08.435 --> 00:29:11.938]  And one is threatened.
[00:29:11.938 --> 00:29:14.060]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:16.862]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:27.010]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:30.552]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:29:30.552 --> 00:29:30.973]  That's right.
[00:29:33.434 --> 00:29:42.785]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[00:29:42.785 --> 00:29:45.948]  Was it difficult?
[00:29:45.948 --> 00:29:46.749]  Not at all.
[00:29:46.749 --> 00:29:47.249]  Not at all.
[00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:58.555]  Maybe as a child you don't see the connection, but it created no problem at all.
[00:29:58.555 --> 00:29:59.836]  No feeling of guilt?
[00:29:59.836 --> 00:30:00.396]  No.
[00:30:00.396 --> 00:30:08.980]  For example, that I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go, I could just as easily be there, I should be there.
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.400]  None of that?
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:23.228]  Well, of course I could be on the other side, or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away.
[00:30:23.228 --> 00:30:29.491]  But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was...
[00:30:34.021 --> 00:30:47.509]  Well, actually, funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, of course I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:53.252]  Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away.
[00:30:53.252 --> 00:30:57.735]  So I had no role in taking away that property.
[00:30:57.735 --> 00:30:59.476]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[00:30:59.476 --> 00:31:00.997]  Are you religious?
[00:31:00.997 --> 00:31:01.097]  No.
[00:31:03.046 --> 00:31:04.547]  Do you believe in God?
[00:31:04.547 --> 00:31:07.369]  No.
[00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:08.450]  All right.
[00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:26.503]  My mission here today is to offer the First Amendment because as long as you're not carrying out violence against someone or asking people to be violent, like the left's asked people to burn down cities and attack Republicans and celebrate a Rand Paul and Scalise being shot and attacked, then you have your free speech.
[00:31:26.503 --> 00:31:31.067]  And when the left came out in the last 10 years and really accelerated the last five, six,
[00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:32.595]  I don't
[00:31:47.122 --> 00:31:48.424]  It's a divide-and-conquer strategy.
[00:31:48.424 --> 00:31:50.006]  I'm not getting into the reparations debate.
[00:31:50.006 --> 00:31:53.571]  I'm saying the groups pushing reparations are trying to cause division.
[00:31:53.571 --> 00:32:01.921]  So, I've said it, the most Nazi-like activities I've seen, and the Nazis, in my view, were thugs that shook people down and did a lot of really bad things.
[00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:03.023]  But they did good things, too.
[00:32:03.023 --> 00:32:05.065]  We're going to stop dissing the Nazis all the time.
[00:32:05.689 --> 00:32:06.470]  Okay.
[00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:07.390]  We're going to get to that.
[00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:19.998]  I don't want to get digressed into this, but remember I told you a story about my grandfather growing up in the richest neighborhood in Dallas, and down the street was a famous German-American inventor.
[00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:21.579]  And he was a first-generation person.
[00:32:21.579 --> 00:32:29.144]  He'd come here when he was a little kid on a ship, and he yelled a bunch of the patents on refrigeration and air conditioning.
[00:32:29.144 --> 00:32:34.408]  And my grandfather worked at the time he was about eight years old because he took him under his wing.
[00:32:37.014 --> 00:32:43.736]  In his little tinkering factory, then he had factories in places like Detroit that actually built the stuff.
[00:32:43.736 --> 00:33:00.302]  And my grandfather, the main reason he joined the Army Air Corps, he told me, and he didn't tell me a lot about this, he just told me this story, was because he watched that man very quietly, once Hitler got power in the 30s, suck every dime out of him, or he would kill his relatives in Germany.
[00:33:00.302 --> 00:33:03.163]  And that guy was blond-haired and blue-eyed, was as German as
[00:33:03.963 --> 00:33:09.625]  As you can get, as Arnold Schwarzenegger, or as Teutonic, as Germanic.
[00:33:09.625 --> 00:33:11.646]  And the point was, my grandfather saw that.
[00:33:11.646 --> 00:33:18.609]  So I understand you're opposed to other forces, but I don't think they're thinking other forces in history that are lionized.
[00:33:18.609 --> 00:33:21.850]  That's my personal experience of what my grandfather...
[00:33:23.971 --> 00:33:25.593]  Clyde William Hammond told me.
[00:33:25.593 --> 00:33:27.414]  Does that make sense?
[00:33:27.414 --> 00:33:33.620]  Not totally to me, but it's, and I'm not saying that to be disrespectful, I'm saying like it literally doesn't totally make sense to me.
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.882]  I'm following it, but I was just thinking about Satan.
[00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:47.372]  That whether it's the Zionists or Hitler, it's not the person, it's Satan using the people that are controlled by demonic forces.
[00:33:47.372 --> 00:33:50.775]  But what I'm going to say is the Jewish media has made us feel like
[00:33:51.355 --> 00:33:55.977]  The Nazis and Hitler have never offered anything of value to the world.
[00:33:55.977 --> 00:33:58.938]  Meanwhile, there's all of these things that are happening.
[00:33:58.938 --> 00:34:05.781]  Planned Parenthood is New World Order population eugenics that is happening to this date.
[00:34:05.781 --> 00:34:10.503]  I got some jokes here from Owen Benjamin that I want to read about Ben Shapiro.
[00:34:10.503 --> 00:34:13.904]  Hey, Candace Owens, unplug this robot before he runs his mouth.
[00:34:15.305 --> 00:34:18.926]  Ben Shapiro's cardio is picking up shackles.
[00:34:18.926 --> 00:34:25.069]  Shapiro can tell how much change is in your pocket just from hearing a jingle.
[00:34:25.069 --> 00:34:29.511]  Shapiro is just mad that Kyrie won't sign his basketball.
[00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:30.172]  Back to you, Alex.
[00:34:32.025 --> 00:34:33.065]  Nick, you're sitting over there.
[00:34:33.065 --> 00:34:34.546]  You want to say something?
[00:34:34.546 --> 00:34:37.686]  Yeah, well, I agree with Ye.
[00:34:37.686 --> 00:34:46.508]  I think that when you look at what's going on today, so much of the political landscape happens in the shadow of World War II and the Nazis and Hitler.
[00:34:46.508 --> 00:34:51.549]  And I think it requires a little bit of an investigation and examination of where those values come from.
[00:34:51.549 --> 00:34:56.030]  You know, people talk about Nazis and Hitler, but the United States had camps as well.
[00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.951]  The United States put the Japanese in internment.
[00:34:57.951 --> 00:34:59.771]  The United States injected black people with syphilis.
[00:35:00.071 --> 00:35:02.894]  Yeah, and you... No, no, I totally agree with you.
[00:35:02.894 --> 00:35:11.184]  The United States has Instagram selling pornography to little kids and they're selling, people are selling, it's prostitution rings.
[00:35:11.184 --> 00:35:14.127]  So is your point, let he without sin cast the first stone?
[00:35:14.127 --> 00:35:14.488]  You're just...
[00:35:15.729 --> 00:35:18.250]  Instagram is a prostitution ring.
[00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:22.951]  Like, I went 30 days off of Instagram and it was the best part of the fast.
[00:35:22.951 --> 00:35:27.013]  Me getting kicked off of Instagram was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:35:27.013 --> 00:35:37.276]  Because when I go to it, it's like watching it with the they live goggles, which is something that, uh, Owen, Owen Benjamin, you guys got to pull this up.
[00:35:37.276 --> 00:35:42.538]  Dave Chappelle is a hack and he gets a lot of his jokes from Owen Benjamin.
[00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:49.802]  Deschapelle went on a Jewish platform and said, they dropped that nigga!
[00:35:49.802 --> 00:35:57.587]  Deschapelle said, they dropped that nigga, talking about yay, and he called me Kanye, and I'm supposed to be his friend.
[00:35:57.587 --> 00:36:02.349]  Deschapelle does not believe in God, and does not believe in Jesus.
[00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:06.292]  These are the kind of black leaders that the Zionists put in front of us.
[00:36:07.395 --> 00:36:13.139]  And meanwhile, we want to knock Herschel Walker, but Herschel Walker changed his life for Christ.
[00:36:13.139 --> 00:36:17.262]  And he might have had abortions, but he doesn't believe in abortion.
[00:36:17.262 --> 00:36:17.682]  I have too.
[00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:18.543]  What matters is the heart.
[00:36:18.543 --> 00:36:19.023]  Go ahead.
[00:36:24.813 --> 00:36:26.034]  Yeah, I agree with Ye.
[00:36:26.034 --> 00:36:36.039]  I think that it's time that America has a fearless, visionary leader who serves Christ, who wants to bring the future forth in engineering and theology.
[00:36:36.039 --> 00:36:43.363]  I think that when you look at the options that were offered, and I said this on my show the other week and the news said, oh, he supports DeSantis.
[00:36:43.363 --> 00:36:45.724]  I said the moderate Trump... Who is DeSantis?
[00:36:45.724 --> 00:36:46.425]  Nobody even knows.
[00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:49.566]  It's just somebody that all the left are all asserting.
[00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:50.387]  Let me raise that.
[00:36:50.387 --> 00:36:50.907]  Let me raise that.
[00:36:50.907 --> 00:36:52.328]  Since you guys got into this,
[00:36:52.988 --> 00:36:54.089]  We'll do hours on this.
[00:36:54.089 --> 00:36:55.309]  Did I cut you off, Nick?
[00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:57.730]  Let him complete his thought.
[00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:05.473]  So the moderate Trump vs. DeSantis will not produce any outcome where America or Jesus is put first.
[00:37:05.473 --> 00:37:09.435]  DeSantis is mobbed up with Israel and Mossad.
[00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:14.217]  Donald Trump, his speech, his announcement was written by Jason Miller, who's controlled by foreign interests.
[00:37:14.777 --> 00:37:24.726]  If there's a Republican primary between them two and they go up against Biden or they go up against Newsom, there is exactly zero chance that we get any kind of regime that's going to deliver the real change we need.
[00:37:24.726 --> 00:37:25.366]  Nick, I got a question.
[00:37:25.366 --> 00:37:31.211]  If I say something that's provocative towards the Mossad, is that Mossad-genistic?
[00:37:31.211 --> 00:37:35.254]  Hold on, let's hear from Net... Hey, you!
[00:37:35.254 --> 00:37:37.176]  I'm the head of the Mossad!
[00:37:37.176 --> 00:37:39.838]  I'm gonna kill you and take the children away from you!
[00:37:39.838 --> 00:37:40.639]  Thanks a lot, Netton.
[00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:42.317]  Back to you, Alex.
[00:38:01.275 --> 00:38:07.780]  I was tired of picking up the yahoo and the netting so for now he's just netting I know some people call him BB.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:15.124]  I know some people call him yahoo, but we're gonna call him netting What you want netting?
[00:38:33.898 --> 00:38:40.824]  So, in a little while, hopefully you're going to take the mask off, because is this actually gay here?
[00:38:40.824 --> 00:38:43.587]  Folks, the mask is coming off in a little while, hopefully.
[00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:46.870]  We're going to be able to have a discussion about this.
[00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:47.871]  But I mean, seriously.
[00:38:48.963 --> 00:38:57.150]  You have the globalists pushing a poison shot that's already killed 20 million people that they admit doesn't work, and then you're the bad guy for criticizing a group.
[00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:04.196]  What I'm saying is, when the left said white people are inherently bad because they're white the last six, seven years, they opened the gates up.
[00:39:04.196 --> 00:39:05.557]  So what do they expect?
[00:39:05.557 --> 00:39:09.781]  It's wrong, in my view, to say any group is inherently bad or has these traits or whatever.
[00:39:09.781 --> 00:39:11.082]  We should judge the individual.
[00:39:11.082 --> 00:39:14.925]  But it's wrong for the ADL to have what?
[00:39:15.505 --> 00:39:16.626]  Very racial policies.
[00:39:16.626 --> 00:39:17.867]  The ADL is played out.
[00:39:17.867 --> 00:39:19.228]  Nobody knows who the ADL are.
[00:39:19.228 --> 00:39:20.389]  Stop giving them attention.
[00:39:20.389 --> 00:39:21.830]  Nobody cares about the ADL.
[00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:22.511]  ADL shut up.
[00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:24.352]  They run all the censorship and everything.
[00:39:24.352 --> 00:39:25.453]  They don't run anything.
[00:39:25.453 --> 00:39:26.154]  They're played out.
[00:39:26.154 --> 00:39:29.136]  We run the streets.
[00:39:29.136 --> 00:39:31.538]  Well, I'm singling out the ADL.
[00:39:31.538 --> 00:39:33.039]  We don't know who they are.
[00:39:33.039 --> 00:39:37.442]  No one in high school knew what the word anti-semitic was until Ye made it popular.
[00:39:37.442 --> 00:39:39.904]  No, I hear you.
[00:39:39.904 --> 00:39:41.926]  It's definitely a tiger by the tail.
[00:39:41.926 --> 00:39:42.787]  Nick, you want to comment here?
[00:39:44.082 --> 00:40:00.847]  Uh, yeah, I just want to jump in and say that, um, you know, I don't think Ye or I are saying that any group is particularly bad or that Jews as a group are bad, but there are Jewish practices that are based on Jewish law, and there is clearly some kind of a Jewish mafia.
[00:40:00.847 --> 00:40:02.407]  I'll give you a perfect example.
[00:40:02.407 --> 00:40:04.468]  It was Ari Emanuel of WME,
[00:40:05.188 --> 00:40:07.229]  They called for a total boycott on Ye.
[00:40:07.229 --> 00:40:18.335]  Ari Emanuel's two brothers are Zeke Emanuel, who is the architect of Obamacare in the Obama White House, and his other brother is Rahm Emanuel, who is the chief of staff for Obama and the mayor of Chicago.
[00:40:18.335 --> 00:40:24.318]  Their father, Benjamin Emanuel, was part of the Ergon, which was a Zionist terrorist group in the 1940s.
[00:40:25.839 --> 00:40:32.724]  The definition of antisemitism, according to the State Department, is if you say Jews have any allegiance to Israel, it's antisemitic.
[00:40:32.724 --> 00:40:37.787]  If you say that Jews have any kind of conspiratorial influence in America, it's antisemitic.
[00:40:37.787 --> 00:40:42.631]  So we're supposed to believe that if Rahm picks up the phone and gets on a call with Zeke and Ari...
[00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:49.374]  And they talk about their jobs, which are running Hollywood and running the Obama White House, a conspiracy.
[00:40:49.374 --> 00:40:50.515]  We acknowledge that happens.
[00:40:50.515 --> 00:40:52.336]  We're called anti-Semitic.
[00:40:52.336 --> 00:40:53.457]  But it's the truth.
[00:40:53.457 --> 00:40:54.938]  It's the truth that they make those calls.
[00:40:54.938 --> 00:40:56.939]  And it doesn't mean that every Jewish person is in on it.
[00:40:56.939 --> 00:41:02.142]  There are good Jews like Derren Beattie and Laura Loomer and, you know, there are lots of fine people.
[00:41:03.763 --> 00:41:09.330]  Also, it's like there's Jewish people that are basically hiding me under their floorboards right now.
[00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.151]  Under their wooden floors.
[00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:13.295]  It's like a reverse version of the Holocaust.
[00:41:13.295 --> 00:41:18.622]  Because there's Jewish people that saw how I was treated and they're like, this is wrong.
[00:41:18.622 --> 00:41:21.025]  This guy just gave an opinion.
[00:41:21.525 --> 00:41:23.767]  I didn't cause any harm.
[00:41:23.767 --> 00:41:26.028]  I didn't harm anyone.
[00:41:26.028 --> 00:41:29.771]  All I said is, and I spelled it wrong, because I was drinking alcohol.
[00:41:29.771 --> 00:41:33.674]  And we see the Bible says you can drink, but the king should not drink, right?
[00:41:33.674 --> 00:41:34.775]  And I shouldn't have been drinking.
[00:41:34.775 --> 00:41:35.995]  I shouldn't have said DEFCON.
[00:41:35.995 --> 00:41:40.599]  That was a $2 billion tweet, basically.
[00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:42.680]  I know you know about getting sued.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:43.261]  I hear you.
[00:41:43.261 --> 00:41:44.902]  So let's expand.
[00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.323]  Yeah, that's also drinking.
[00:41:46.323 --> 00:41:47.604]  So let's expand on this.
[00:41:48.988 --> 00:41:51.470]  What you say is what I'm trying to say.
[00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.372]  You didn't kill anybody.
[00:41:53.372 --> 00:42:01.320]  You're simply here saying this, and you're being demonized and attacked, and you're saying that that is hypocritical, but that's what I'm trying to tell you.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:07.625]  George Soros admits he went around rounding up Jews who thought they were going to be protected, stole their money, and sent them to Nazis.
[00:42:08.286 --> 00:42:11.007]  What my point is, is that that's what the left does.
[00:42:11.007 --> 00:42:16.888]  They hide behind black people, they hide behind Jews, they hide behind groups, and they use racial politics to control.
[00:42:16.888 --> 00:42:22.490]  And so I think that's the most important thing, is to understand that we can all come together under Christ.
[00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:25.290]  Also, they blackmail... Okay, go ahead about the Christ thing.
[00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:25.811]  I want to hear this.
[00:42:25.811 --> 00:42:27.091]  No, we can just... I'm just saying...
[00:42:27.811 --> 00:42:32.553]  I mean, I don't hate anybody because of their religion or their background.
[00:42:32.553 --> 00:42:34.134]  And there's great people from every organization.
[00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:36.455]  And I think George Soros can come to Christ.
[00:42:36.455 --> 00:42:39.817]  It is a possibility that he can convert and come to Christ.
[00:42:39.817 --> 00:42:42.298]  Would you meet with George Soros if he wanted to meet with you?
[00:42:42.298 --> 00:42:42.658]  Absolutely.
[00:42:42.658 --> 00:42:43.858]  I would meet with anyone.
[00:42:43.858 --> 00:42:45.139]  That's the only thing.
[00:42:45.139 --> 00:42:46.239]  Laura, we're live.
[00:42:46.239 --> 00:42:46.940]  What's up?
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.761]  This is Laura Loomer.
[00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:51.022]  I'm watching live.
[00:42:51.022 --> 00:42:53.063]  I saw you just said that you wanted me to call in.
[00:42:53.063 --> 00:42:54.503]  So I'm calling in.
[00:42:54.503 --> 00:42:55.884]  Well, how does she have your number?
[00:42:57.319 --> 00:43:01.923]  Well, she called me because she had some concerns about Milo running my campaign.
[00:43:01.923 --> 00:43:02.503]  Oh, that's great.
[00:43:02.503 --> 00:43:04.004]  So here's the deal.
[00:43:04.004 --> 00:43:05.605]  We've got Laura Loomer's number.
[00:43:05.605 --> 00:43:07.667]  Can we call her on Skype or Zoom?
[00:43:07.667 --> 00:43:09.949]  Can we actually put her on the show?
[00:43:09.949 --> 00:43:12.671]  Laura, you're on via speakerphone.
[00:43:12.671 --> 00:43:15.333]  Can you come on via Skype or via phone right now?
[00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:19.436]  Yeah, I can't do video right now, but I could do audio.
[00:43:19.436 --> 00:43:20.317]  I texted your producer.
[00:43:20.317 --> 00:43:23.399]  Laura, we're going to call you right now.
[00:43:23.399 --> 00:43:24.860]  We're going to put you on air in two minutes.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.241]  Don't trash Milo.
[00:43:26.241 --> 00:43:26.882]  I like Milo.
[00:43:29.142 --> 00:43:30.544]  I'll call her right now.
[00:43:30.544 --> 00:43:32.046]  You didn't say yes.
[00:43:32.046 --> 00:43:34.329]  Yeah, they're gonna call her.
[00:43:34.329 --> 00:43:36.071]  This is crazy.
[00:43:36.071 --> 00:43:39.676]  Listen, all I'm trying to say is... Milo's Jewish.
[00:43:39.676 --> 00:43:40.257]  I love Milo.
[00:43:42.387 --> 00:43:45.328]  And you've got a little bit of the Hitler fetish going on.
[00:43:45.328 --> 00:43:46.849]  It's not a fetish.
[00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:47.569]  It's not a fetish.
[00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:51.571]  That's a term, like, I just love information.
[00:43:51.571 --> 00:43:54.012]  They have some documentaries.
[00:43:54.012 --> 00:44:01.715]  Apparently Bezos is allowed to put up any documentary, but if a basketball player tweets it, he'll lose his entire career.
[00:44:01.715 --> 00:44:07.138]  I think that that's... Well, that's where I want to go, because you've got millions, hundreds of millions of Chinese locked down right now.
[00:44:08.178 --> 00:44:08.658]  Bye.
[00:44:08.658 --> 00:44:08.758]  Bye.
[00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.366]  I'm not on the whole Jew thing, is what I'm saying.
[00:44:29.366 --> 00:44:30.407]  I don't care what people talk about.
[00:44:30.407 --> 00:44:31.488]  I live in free speech.
[00:44:31.488 --> 00:44:38.313]  I'm just really worried about the forced injections, world government, 5G, the open borders, the collapsing currencies, war with Russia.
[00:44:38.313 --> 00:44:40.775]  What do you think?
[00:44:40.775 --> 00:44:42.997]  I don't have all of that information.
[00:44:42.997 --> 00:44:48.621]  I have the information that two days ago I thought I was going to be put in prison because my accounts are frozen.
[00:44:48.621 --> 00:44:49.722]  No, I get it.
[00:44:49.722 --> 00:44:53.165]  You're in Hollywood and the managers you see are... So I get it.
[00:44:53.165 --> 00:44:54.646]  From your perspective, I get what you're saying.
[00:44:55.202 --> 00:45:05.388]  Yeah, and I love Jesus, and I have to fight this war to make a better place for my children and for everyone else's children.
[00:45:05.388 --> 00:45:12.233]  I gotta put myself, my accounts, my name at risk to stand in the front of this war that we have.
[00:45:12.233 --> 00:45:13.773]  This is InfoWars, right?
[00:45:13.773 --> 00:45:17.536]  So we're gonna give this information on InfoWars.
[00:45:17.536 --> 00:45:23.499]  By the way, I asked the crew very lovingly, I love the crew, but you guys gave me the tweet I sent you this morning of the
[00:45:25.865 --> 00:45:34.551]  Abortion mill, new world order, depopulation, kill the black people organization, Planned Parenthood, where they said it's white people's job to give money so we can kill black people.
[00:45:34.551 --> 00:45:44.258]  It actually says that and Ye didn't want me to have it on the desk because he wanted to be able to have it all look clean and stuff and I get that so I'm happy for Ye but will you guys give me that damn tweet?
[00:45:44.258 --> 00:45:46.420]  Because I love you to death but I'm asking for an hour.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.401]  I need that damn tweet.
[00:45:48.177 --> 00:46:00.842]  I want to show people this because it is such, it is such mind control to say white people, you've got white guilt, actually say you're bad because you're white, help us kill black people.
[00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:03.543]  What type of freakish crazy world is that?
[00:46:03.543 --> 00:46:04.083]  Gay?
[00:46:04.083 --> 00:46:04.543]  Zionist.
[00:46:06.334 --> 00:46:13.120]  Is that is that too wide of a idea or do I have to just go specifically to who does that?
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.681]  But it's the devil.
[00:46:14.681 --> 00:46:15.301]  It's a devil.
[00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:24.289]  We all like grandma used to say we all need Jesus Christ and where I'm at this position where God is you he's using me as a vessel.
[00:46:24.289 --> 00:46:31.415]  Everyone always knew that I was special but now I get to be a vessel and I feel so, you know, can we I'd like to go into a prayer.
[00:46:31.415 --> 00:46:33.336]  It's a prayer that my cousin wrote now.
[00:46:33.336 --> 00:46:33.957]  This prayer is
[00:46:35.538 --> 00:46:39.479]  It's pretty long, so please don't cut me off in the middle of this prayer.
[00:46:39.479 --> 00:46:40.359]  I'm not, go ahead.
[00:46:40.359 --> 00:46:53.263]  So, what happened is, I was on a, we were doing a family prayer Zoom on Sunday, and his name is Wayne, and he tells me, he says, Kanye, he's like, bro, my name's Jay, you say a prayer.
[00:46:53.743 --> 00:46:57.044]  And then I said my prayer, and I felt that it was very profound.
[00:46:57.044 --> 00:47:10.850]  I felt like it was Ye level bars, where I said, let's remove this whole conversation of morality, and let's go, let's stick to the Bible and say, either Jesus said so, or Jesus said no.
[00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:12.131]  Hold on, I'm gonna wait till you drop this.
[00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:14.220]  Well, I listen.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:14.820]  All right.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:17.222]  So and I felt like that was profound.
[00:47:17.222 --> 00:47:22.765]  That's like a bar that made me top five streaming artists without an album this year.
[00:47:22.765 --> 00:47:29.750]  Either Jesus said so or Jesus said no because we want to bring in our creative direction in our opinion and our moral compass.
[00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:31.451]  Forget the words moral compass.
[00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:32.992]  Is it in the Bible?
[00:47:32.992 --> 00:47:34.493]  What are the red letters say?
[00:47:34.493 --> 00:47:36.174]  What did Jesus say about it?
[00:47:36.174 --> 00:47:38.456]  And then we make our decisions off of that.
[00:47:38.456 --> 00:47:41.998]  So I said this and then I also was I had an idea.
[00:47:41.998 --> 00:47:42.859]  Let's stop hoping.
[00:47:43.619 --> 00:47:44.320]  Let's pray.
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.782]  Let's talk directly to God.
[00:47:45.782 --> 00:47:47.043]  Let's stop hoping for stuff.
[00:47:47.043 --> 00:47:47.544]  I agree with that.
[00:47:47.544 --> 00:47:57.995]  He has hope in here and I took it out and I put it back in and then he and so I said this prayer and my family members they didn't say anything and then he said his prayer and
[00:47:58.476 --> 00:48:02.478]  And all the whole family was like, oh, that's the best prayer I ever heard!
[00:48:02.478 --> 00:48:03.939]  And he's like, I know, I know.
[00:48:03.939 --> 00:48:05.940]  My prayers can be intimidating.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.141]  I know, I know.
[00:48:07.141 --> 00:48:08.922]  They're like, did you write that down?
[00:48:08.922 --> 00:48:10.283]  That was the best prayer ever!
[00:48:10.283 --> 00:48:12.584]  And I was thinking like, bro, why you set me up?
[00:48:12.584 --> 00:48:15.146]  Why you set me up to say my prayer right before your prayer?
[00:48:15.146 --> 00:48:16.466]  But this is his prayer.
[00:48:16.466 --> 00:48:17.847]  I was like, yo, send me that prayer, bro.
[00:48:17.847 --> 00:48:19.708]  That prayer was pretty good.
[00:48:19.708 --> 00:48:25.652]  It says, now Nick is Catholic, so he doesn't like referring to Jesus as Yahweh God.
[00:48:26.934 --> 00:48:29.017]  But I am.
[00:48:29.017 --> 00:48:30.299]  But am I black?
[00:48:30.299 --> 00:48:31.340]  Am I African?
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.604]  Am I Semite?
[00:48:33.604 --> 00:48:34.986]  Well, what is it?
[00:48:34.986 --> 00:48:36.227]  They call me anti-Semite.
[00:48:36.227 --> 00:48:37.429]  They said I'm a nigga and rap.
[00:48:37.429 --> 00:48:38.310]  They said I'm black.
[00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.993]  They told me, say it loud.
[00:48:39.993 --> 00:48:41.715]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[00:48:41.715 --> 00:48:43.298]  OK, James Brown, you tell me who I am.
[00:48:43.858 --> 00:48:47.502]  But, I know that I'm a child of God and I know Jesus died for us.
[00:48:47.502 --> 00:48:50.684]  This is the daily prayer written by my cousin Wayne.
[00:48:50.684 --> 00:48:53.867]  Yahweh God, thank you for life, health, and strength.
[00:48:53.867 --> 00:48:55.909]  Faith, hope, and love.
[00:48:55.909 --> 00:48:59.312]  And another day to bless, protect your most holy name.
[00:48:59.312 --> 00:49:05.017]  I surrender all Yahweh God and acknowledge that all things are spiritual before they are physical.
[00:49:05.017 --> 00:49:05.718]  For this reason,
[00:49:06.218 --> 00:49:13.302]  We also declare and decree that you are the maker, master, ruler, creator, and guider of our spiritual lives.
[00:49:13.302 --> 00:49:22.306]  We also acknowledge our brother Jesus, Yahshua, and the blood he shed that gave us blood-paved pathways back to the holy of the holies.
[00:49:22.306 --> 00:49:30.050]  As we humbly come before you, your almighty throne of mercy and grace, we welcome your glory to the rest...
[00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:48.021]  to rest heavenly upon our shoulders bless our crown with supernatural wisdom and understanding Yahweh God so that we may walk in the true knowledge of who you are and who you created us to be quiet our spiritual minds Yahweh God God slow us down and put us
[00:49:48.801 --> 00:49:54.643]  In proper alignment and divine timing with the will and purpose you have for our lives.
[00:49:54.643 --> 00:50:01.346]  Open our spiritual eyes, Yahweh God, so we may better see all of the divine things of the Spirit.
[00:50:01.346 --> 00:50:07.668]  Open our spiritual ears, Yahweh God, so we may better hear all of the sacred things of the Spirit.
[00:50:07.668 --> 00:50:10.489]  Guard our spiritual mouth, Yahweh God.
[00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:16.111]  Place a censer over our divine tongues, so we may only speak words that glorify and edify you.
[00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:28.716]  Soften our spiritual heart, Yahweh God, so we may walk into deeper communion, communication, commitment, intimacy, understanding, and a relationship with all of the divine things of the Spirit.
[00:50:28.716 --> 00:50:30.897]  Yahweh God, we recognize that
[00:50:32.784 --> 00:50:41.126]  We do not battle against flesh and blood, but against spirits and powers, principalities and rulers of spiritual wickedness in heavenly places.
[00:50:41.126 --> 00:50:45.687]  It is for this reason that we put on the whole armor of God, Yahweh God.
[00:50:45.687 --> 00:50:50.868]  We put on the helmet of salvation and the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:50:50.868 --> 00:50:57.829]  We firmly attach the belt of truth around our waist and drench our feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:50:58.229 --> 00:51:07.651]  We take our Sword of Life Spirit, which is the Word of Life and the Shield of Faith, with which we will quench all of the fiery darts of the enemy.
[00:51:07.651 --> 00:51:20.514]  Thank you for blessing us from the top of our head to the bottom of our feet and everywhere in between with the first, what we need, everything that we deserve, and then the best that you have for our lives, Yahweh God.
[00:51:20.514 --> 00:51:22.254]  In Jesus' name, Amen.
[00:51:22.254 --> 00:51:23.674]  And perfect time to go to break.
[00:51:23.674 --> 00:51:26.655]  Hour number two, Uncensored with Ye.
[00:51:27.475 --> 00:51:30.716]  Nick Fuentes, I'm your guest host here in St.
[00:51:30.716 --> 00:51:33.156]  Asylum World, because the whole world's crazy.
[00:51:33.156 --> 00:51:34.237]  All of us are nuts.
[00:51:34.237 --> 00:51:35.757]  This is Twilight Zone 2.0.
[00:51:35.757 --> 00:51:37.378]  We will be right back.
[00:51:37.378 --> 00:51:39.058]  Don't disappoint me when you say that.
[00:51:39.058 --> 00:51:40.038]  No, I'm talking about all of us.
[00:51:40.038 --> 00:51:40.838]  The whole world's crazy.
[00:51:40.838 --> 00:51:42.819]  It is crazy.
[00:51:42.819 --> 00:51:44.439]  Everybody's crazy.
[00:51:44.439 --> 00:51:45.820]  I believe that.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.860]  I'm saying the guest host here because these guys are hosting.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.461]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:52:04.434 --> 00:52:13.279]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:52:13.279 --> 00:52:17.101]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:52:17.101 --> 00:52:26.186]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[00:52:26.186 --> 00:52:28.208]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[00:52:28.988 --> 00:52:32.411]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[00:52:32.411 --> 00:52:33.852]  This is a game changer.
[00:52:33.852 --> 00:52:35.413]  We're so excited about it.
[00:52:35.413 --> 00:52:37.655]  Our listeners should really ask for free shipping again.
[00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:42.099]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[00:52:42.099 --> 00:52:45.221]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[00:52:45.221 --> 00:52:47.203]  The same great customer service and more.
[00:52:47.663 --> 00:52:54.047]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:52:54.047 --> 00:53:01.092]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:53:01.092 --> 00:53:01.913]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:53:04.386 --> 00:53:13.330]  The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this cabinet are actually young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:17.532]  So if we penetrate the cabinets... Everything we discussed has been leaked to the press.
[00:53:17.532 --> 00:53:19.133]  That's not the purpose.
[00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:21.534]  And we're not that smart either.
[00:53:28.076 --> 00:53:31.777]  Canadians are watching very closely.
[00:53:31.777 --> 00:53:42.021]  Obviously everyone in China should be allowed to express themselves, should be allowed to share their perspectives and indeed protest.
[00:53:42.021 --> 00:53:42.761]  We're going to continue.
[00:53:43.161 --> 00:53:44.964]  There's a level of admiration I actually have for China.
[00:54:01.131 --> 00:54:13.124]  Because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say, we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[00:54:13.124 --> 00:54:19.170]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.733]  That I find quite interesting.
[00:54:22.262 --> 00:54:32.619]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that's wrong.
[00:54:33.584 --> 00:54:35.904]  We're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[00:54:35.904 --> 00:54:58.529]  The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other
[00:54:59.542 --> 00:55:05.007]  Is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[00:55:05.007 --> 00:55:16.477]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless.
[00:55:16.477 --> 00:55:21.401]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:22.302]  We won't cave
[00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:28.916]  To those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[00:55:28.916 --> 00:55:33.400]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:42.670]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:43.210]  As of today.
[00:55:44.286 --> 00:55:54.956]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[00:55:54.956 --> 00:55:57.979]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[00:55:57.979 --> 00:56:01.061]  But I started to read what he said.
[00:56:01.061 --> 00:56:02.363]  This is a couple of weeks ago.
[00:56:02.363 --> 00:56:07.187]  He was or maybe this is September, but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[00:56:08.288 --> 00:56:09.830]  He said, they don't believe in science.
[00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:12.193]  They're often misogynistic, often racist.
[00:56:12.193 --> 00:56:12.934]  No, they're not.
[00:56:12.934 --> 00:56:14.716]  That was not smart of him at all.
[00:56:14.716 --> 00:56:15.056]  Right.
[00:56:15.056 --> 00:56:18.380]  He said, but they take up space.
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:22.385]  And with that, we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country.
[00:56:22.385 --> 00:56:24.087]  Do we tolerate these people?
[00:56:24.087 --> 00:56:25.268]  It's like, tolerate?
[00:56:25.268 --> 00:56:26.509]  Now you do sound like Hitler.
[00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:35.335]  Well, the Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left doesn't like, at least in government.
[00:56:35.335 --> 00:56:41.119]  But there's a new avenue for those who would like to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations.
[00:56:41.119 --> 00:56:43.460]  The left have wised up to this.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.884]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it.
[00:56:48.884 --> 00:56:50.225]  The social media giants.
[00:56:50.225 --> 00:56:50.605]  And they are.
[00:56:50.965 --> 00:56:56.687]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[00:56:56.687 --> 00:57:01.509]  So far the most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio show host Alex Jones.
[00:57:01.509 --> 00:57:09.152]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[00:57:09.292 --> 00:57:15.334]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:57:15.334 --> 00:57:22.376]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content will be a little harder to find.
[00:57:22.376 --> 00:57:32.179]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[00:57:32.796 --> 00:57:34.297]  People know what's true.
[00:57:34.297 --> 00:57:35.617]  They can smell it.
[00:57:35.617 --> 00:57:41.059]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:57:41.059 --> 00:57:43.080]  In a free country, everyone can be heard.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.702]  In totalitarian societies, only the powerful can be heard.
[00:57:55.416 --> 00:58:02.598]  The evil abuse of children that the world is waking up to today has been going on for many, many years.
[00:58:02.598 --> 00:58:17.002]  The Industrial Revolution was fueled by hundreds of thousands of children sold off of orphan trains at local fairs across the country, many of which were born within orphan asylums and referred to as foundlings.
[00:58:17.842 --> 00:58:23.566]  History shows us that not everyone sees an innocent child as someone to protect.
[00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:31.851]  And the Balenciaga scandal is exposing a hidden cult that celebrates the death and torture of children.
[00:58:31.851 --> 00:58:40.476]  The same photographer who placed the Supreme Court ruling on child porn in the Balenciaga ad that sparked this whole recent scandal.
[00:58:40.956 --> 00:58:58.887]  Also did a photo shoot for France's Double Magazine that featured a traumatized looking child having her passport photo taken for a trip to the same Disney Cruise Line that provides snorkeling trips off the coast of Epstein's Island, otherwise known as Little St.
[00:58:58.887 --> 00:58:59.948]  James.
[00:58:59.948 --> 00:59:08.873]  Both photo shoots appear to have been styled by Russian stylist Lada Volkova, a highly celebrated stylist in the fashion industry.
[00:59:09.133 --> 00:59:16.957]  Who works for Vogue, Adidas, Chanel, and has been a top stylist for Balenciaga since 2014.
[00:59:16.957 --> 00:59:20.839]  She has deleted her Instagram account since the scandal hit.
[00:59:20.839 --> 00:59:25.821]  But archived images show a dark appreciation for child abuse.
[00:59:25.821 --> 00:59:33.525]  Images of violent pedophilia, child torture, child disembowelment, Satanism, and cannibalism.
[00:59:34.125 --> 00:59:46.411]  Many of these images are appreciated by her rich and famous designer friends, Gosha Rubchinsky and Mark Jacobs, both accused of peddling pedophilia in their own work.
[00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:53.534]  A recent video shows what appears to be fake babies sold in blood-spattered Balenciaga schwag.
[00:59:53.874 --> 00:59:54.955]  What's in your bag?
[00:59:54.955 --> 00:59:55.555]  In my bag?
[00:59:55.555 --> 01:00:00.919]  I don't know, like, stuff or maybe... Or like... Can we do a what's in your bag?
[01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:03.881]  Yeah, can we do a what's in the bag, please?
[01:00:03.881 --> 01:00:06.623]  Can I hold it for you and you can take things out?
[01:00:06.623 --> 01:00:07.184]  Excuse me.
[01:00:07.184 --> 01:00:07.524]  Yeah.
[01:00:09.285 --> 01:00:11.986]  There's like a, like when she starts to cry, like, then when she's gonna pee, I don't know.
[01:00:11.986 --> 01:00:12.927]  Then when she's boring, I don't know.
[01:00:12.927 --> 01:00:13.587]  Yeah, everything possible.
[01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:39.749]  Right as the Balenciaga scandal goes viral, Hollywood actress Nicole Kidman, who was recently glamorizing eating bugs, proudly releases her own Balenciaga ad on Instagram.
[01:00:40.962 --> 01:00:48.049]  From what we are learning about these people, it seems strange for us to put our faith in any single one of them.
[01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:51.232]  And by all appearances, this wasn't an accident.
[01:00:51.232 --> 01:00:54.235]  It seems to be another demoralizing PSYOP.
[01:00:54.235 --> 01:00:56.798]  The Balenciaga stuff just gets worse and worse.
[01:00:56.798 --> 01:00:57.259]  Check this out.
[01:00:58.496 --> 01:01:05.988]  The people that recruited all of the models for Balenciaga's runway show was a woman called Rachel Chandler who has been on Jeffrey Epstein's island.
[01:01:05.988 --> 01:01:12.379]  She's even posted a picture on Instagram of CCTV footage back in 2013 bragging about being on the island.
[01:01:12.915 --> 01:01:18.119]  This stuff's got me wondering if all high-end fashion brands are just fronts for human trafficking.
[01:01:18.119 --> 01:01:24.445]  So most of us know by now that Balenciaga got themselves cancelled by having BDSM bears photographed with children.
[01:01:24.445 --> 01:01:32.811]  The same style bears were featured in one of their last runway shows, which was held in a mud pit, as if the brand weren't disgusting enough.
[01:01:32.811 --> 01:01:34.233]  But who opened for the show?
[01:01:39.172 --> 01:01:44.455]  Yeah, Kanye West was pretty close with Balenciaga before they got cancelled for that last photo shoot.
[01:01:44.455 --> 01:01:47.116]  Kanye's been all over the place for years.
[01:01:47.116 --> 01:01:48.597]  Everybody knows that.
[01:01:48.597 --> 01:01:49.717]  I'm sure he's been through a lot.
[01:01:49.717 --> 01:01:52.379]  I feel for him, but let's keep our eyes open, yeah?
[01:01:52.379 --> 01:02:02.984]  It's a very small club, and yet the majority of us still seem to obsess over them, like royalty, which begs the question, do we have any power?
[01:02:02.984 --> 01:02:07.587]  And if we someday find that we do, what are we going to do about this evil?
[01:02:08.548 --> 01:02:11.016]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:02:35.242 --> 01:02:37.123]  It's almost like we got Ye here.
[01:02:37.123 --> 01:02:39.784]  The whole building is just crazy.
[01:02:39.784 --> 01:02:41.645]  Alex Jones here back live with Ye.
[01:02:41.645 --> 01:02:44.246]  Nick Fuentes riding shotgun.
[01:02:44.246 --> 01:02:46.567]  And we're going to get Laura Loomer on the line.
[01:02:46.567 --> 01:02:48.047]  He didn't want to wear an earpiece.
[01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:48.968]  That's fine.
[01:02:48.968 --> 01:02:51.349]  We're going to call her on his phone in like 10 minutes or so.
[01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:52.549]  So we'll get to you, Laura.
[01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:53.770]  But he wants to get her on, so that's great.
[01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:54.770]  We'll get her on.
[01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:58.552]  Ye, let me bring up since you guys want to get on this topic.
[01:02:59.612 --> 01:03:15.162]  The meeting with Trump, they're now using it against Trump, they're misrepresenting who Nick is, and I think that's fair to say, and they're lying about you, and they're trying to make it the new reason that DeSantis should be the 2024 frontrunner.
[01:03:15.162 --> 01:03:20.806]  And I like DeSantis in many ways, but I don't like who he's aligning with, all these big donors, and him playing along with this.
[01:03:20.806 --> 01:03:21.967]  It's very troubling.
[01:03:21.967 --> 01:03:25.109]  So tell us about the meeting and what really happened there.
[01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:26.670]  Nick, you have the minutes on it.
[01:03:27.355 --> 01:03:29.577]  That's right.
[01:03:29.577 --> 01:03:33.020]  So, where to begin?
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:41.327]  I want to set the record straight, first of all, because there was a big piece on NBC the other day written by Mark Caputo with a lot of lies about the dinner.
[01:03:41.327 --> 01:03:43.949]  I don't know if people were misquoted or if bad quotes were given.
[01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:49.971]  People are being led to believe that this was somehow a setup or an ambush to make the president look bad.
[01:03:49.971 --> 01:03:51.111]  That's not true.
[01:03:51.111 --> 01:03:52.292]  Ye loves Trump.
[01:03:52.292 --> 01:03:53.412]  I love Trump.
[01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:59.253]  We came to the dinner to have a discussion with him and have a discussion with him about the 2024 race.
[01:03:59.253 --> 01:04:01.394]  Ye had a proposition for him.
[01:04:01.394 --> 01:04:04.815]  And so a lot of it was really put together in the last minute.
[01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:09.536]  I didn't even really know until I was at Mar-a-Lago whether or not we would be at the dinner.
[01:04:09.536 --> 01:04:13.697]  It was something that Ye and I discussed on the flight there and on the car ride over.
[01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:22.728]  I just want to get that cleared up straight away because I think Ye and I both believe that Trump is a great option.
[01:04:22.728 --> 01:04:25.491]  It really just comes down to Trump and Ye for the most part.
[01:04:25.491 --> 01:04:29.777]  But them trying to premeditatedly claim it was some secret meeting and he knew he was meeting with you, that's not true.
[01:04:30.117 --> 01:04:36.740]  No, yeah, and it was surprising because we had this conversation the day before we flew out.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.061]  We were in L.A.
[01:04:38.061 --> 01:04:43.843]  on that Monday, and I was told it may not even be possible for you to get into Mar-a-Lago.
[01:04:43.843 --> 01:04:51.086]  They said because there's so many people that will intercept you, there's a guest list and you have to be on it, and there's a security list and all these things.
[01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:53.788]  So I was told that I may not even be able to get through.
[01:04:54.528 --> 01:05:06.053]  Well, we pulled up to the club, they checked out Ye, they checked out Karen's ID and information, we drove up, we walked in, we sat down in the lobby, the president came out of the dining room, and that was that.
[01:05:06.053 --> 01:05:15.358]  He invited Ye to dinner, and I don't know if it was Ye or Trump, but one of them said, uh, well, we want to bring, uh, Jamar, uh, Karen and Nick into the dining room.
[01:05:16.118 --> 01:05:22.065]  And so we came in, we sat down, well, we took some pictures, yay, sort of lit up the whole room.
[01:05:22.065 --> 01:05:24.347]  Everybody wanted to get a picture with him.
[01:05:24.347 --> 01:05:26.269]  We sat down at the table.
[01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:29.813]  And I want to say, initially, it was a very pleasant dinner.
[01:05:29.813 --> 01:05:32.476]  Trump gave kind of the standard black voter pitch.
[01:05:32.476 --> 01:05:35.880]  He talked about the HBCUs, the Opportunity Zones, things like that.
[01:05:36.661 --> 01:05:54.422]  And then it turned out that, um, Ye had accidentally sent a text message to a lawyer that both Trump and Ye share, um, and forwarded him some intel that Karen gave to us about how we were going to handle the Trump meeting and how to read his body language and the kinds of things that maybe we should avoid.
[01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:57.044]  Or things we might want to say.
[01:05:57.044 --> 01:06:07.168]  And so before the dinner, Ye accidentally forwarded that to a lawyer, who then in the middle of the dinner apparently called Trump to say, hey, Karen Giorno's involved.
[01:06:07.168 --> 01:06:08.209]  This is a setup.
[01:06:08.209 --> 01:06:10.390]  You guys are being set up right now.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:12.571]  It was really just based on a misunderstanding.
[01:06:13.311 --> 01:06:14.172]  Who's this lawyer?
[01:06:14.172 --> 01:06:14.292]  Yes.
[01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:14.592]  No, I don't.
[01:06:43.491 --> 01:06:45.132]  So the dinner was actually very pleasant.
[01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:46.332]  It was very friendly.
[01:06:46.332 --> 01:06:48.272]  Ye picked out a song to play.
[01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:51.133]  He put on Say You Will off of 808s.
[01:06:51.133 --> 01:06:53.654]  And then Trump said, oh, I don't know, let's put on one of your hits.
[01:06:53.654 --> 01:06:54.654]  So he put on Stronger.
[01:06:54.654 --> 01:06:56.575]  It was very congenial.
[01:06:56.575 --> 01:07:03.477]  Well, then in the middle of the dinner, Trump gets this call because Nick Gravante apparently sent the text to one of Trump's guys or somebody.
[01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:08.258]  Somebody called Trump and said, Karen is giving Ye intel because Karen worked for Trump.
[01:07:08.258 --> 01:07:10.799]  She ran the state of Florida during the Republican primary in 16.
[01:07:12.159 --> 01:07:16.342]  Until he got the heads up, they thought it was some big ambush.
[01:07:16.342 --> 01:07:20.264]  So he gets off the phone, and the tone totally flipped.
[01:07:20.264 --> 01:07:25.648]  And he starts telling Ye these stories about how some of his black constituents had betrayed him.
[01:07:25.648 --> 01:07:26.649]  He told the story about...
[01:07:27.429 --> 01:07:29.671]  How he got A$AP Rocky out of jail.
[01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:35.114]  He told the story about how he got the NBA basketball players out of the Chinese jail.
[01:07:35.114 --> 01:07:39.998]  And the moral of the story was, if you go against me, if you're disloyal to me, I'll crush you.
[01:07:39.998 --> 01:07:43.640]  That was kind of the subtext of the stories from Trump.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:53.367]  He said that Kim, Kim Kardashian, he said some nasty things about her because she endorsed Joe Biden after Trump released, what is it, Alice?
[01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:53.907]  Alice Johnson.
[01:07:54.207 --> 01:07:55.628]  Alex Johnson from prison.
[01:07:55.628 --> 01:07:57.869]  He commuted her sentence and then gave her a pardon.
[01:07:57.869 --> 01:07:59.930]  So he felt betrayed by that.
[01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:05.973]  And then Ye made the proposition and said, hey, I'd like you to be my running mate in 2024.
[01:08:05.973 --> 01:08:08.154]  And Trump sort of... I gave him the opportunity.
[01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:09.215]  I didn't say I would like him.
[01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:11.196]  I said you have the opportunity.
[01:08:11.196 --> 01:08:11.516]  Right.
[01:08:11.516 --> 01:08:11.796]  Yes.
[01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:13.997]  To be my running mate in 2024.
[01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:14.637]  Yes.
[01:08:14.637 --> 01:08:16.859]  Will he wear a mask as well, though?
[01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.960]  I think it would look cool.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.081]  I do think it looks cool.
[01:08:22.188 --> 01:08:50.901]  So he sat back and folded his arms, and he kind of smirked, and he sort of dismissed it, but then he got a little bit heated, and he said, you can't win, you'll never win, don't run, you can win at a lot of things, but you can't win at this, and then he turned to me, and Karen, and said, you guys are smart, I know you work for him, but don't lie to him, tell him, tell him he can't win, and, you know, I love Trump, and I love Ye, and so I'm looking at Trump, and then I'm looking at Ye, and I'm looking at Trump, and Ye, he's telling me,
[01:08:51.971 --> 01:08:54.252]  Nick, they say you're a white supremacist.
[01:08:54.252 --> 01:08:55.212]  Are you a white supremacist?
[01:08:55.212 --> 01:08:56.573]  No, not at all.
[01:08:56.573 --> 01:08:57.953]  Well, spend some time on that.
[01:08:57.953 --> 01:09:03.996]  Yeah, you know, I'm a Catholic, I'm Christian, and so I believe that we are all... I know that sounds white supremacist right there, but it's not.
[01:09:03.996 --> 01:09:04.216]  Go ahead.
[01:09:07.579 --> 01:09:16.585]  Well, I believe that we're all children of God, and so I think that black, white, red, brown, whatever, we're all siblings in a certain sense because we're created by God.
[01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.287]  I do, though, believe that there are races.
[01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:27.232]  There are black people, there are white people, there are Hispanics, and these differences mean something to people, they mean things to each other.
[01:09:27.232 --> 01:09:31.395]  That doesn't mean that we can't get along, that doesn't mean that... But the left's saying it's bad to even have a culture.
[01:09:31.395 --> 01:09:33.517]  They're saying none of us can say I'm this or I'm that.
[01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:34.137]  Right.
[01:09:34.137 --> 01:09:35.457]  They want to melt us all down.
[01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:36.778]  That's what globalization is.
[01:09:36.778 --> 01:09:39.879]  They want to globalize the government, the economy, and the population.
[01:09:39.879 --> 01:09:41.239]  They want a global government.
[01:09:41.239 --> 01:09:43.460]  They want to globalize the economy through free trade.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:44.660]  There's no culture.
[01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:45.180]  Exactly.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.101]  And the population through immigration.
[01:09:47.101 --> 01:09:51.782]  And they want to make it so that in 50, 100 years, there are no distinct nations.
[01:09:51.782 --> 01:09:53.783]  There's no distinct peoples.
[01:09:53.783 --> 01:09:55.323]  So nobody can stand up to them.
[01:09:55.323 --> 01:09:55.624]  Right.
[01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:56.804]  Just a slave class.
[01:09:56.804 --> 01:09:57.844]  Undifferentiated.
[01:09:57.844 --> 01:09:59.305]  That's what they want.
[01:09:59.305 --> 01:10:02.566]  This is the future president you're talking to right now.
[01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:03.446]  Is Nick your running mate?
[01:10:04.503 --> 01:10:05.173]  He's not old enough.
[01:10:06.515 --> 01:10:08.736]  Yeah, Nick, how old are you?
[01:10:08.736 --> 01:10:10.117]  I'm 24.
[01:10:10.117 --> 01:10:11.358]  Maybe in a few cycles.
[01:10:11.358 --> 01:10:13.359]  And Trump loved Nick.
[01:10:13.359 --> 01:10:15.960]  He looked at me, he said, where did you find this kid?
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.082]  He had no idea until what's the guy that wrote the speech that you didn't like?
[01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:19.702]  Jason Miller.
[01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:23.644]  Did Jason Miller lied afterwards after they found out who you were?
[01:10:23.644 --> 01:10:25.925]  And what did Jason say in the press to start off?
[01:10:25.925 --> 01:10:30.748]  Because it started to be like a series of lie after lie after lie and fake.
[01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:31.428]  It wasn't a tweet.
[01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:34.249]  It was a truth social after truth social after truth social.
[01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:36.631]  Give them the rundown on that.
[01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:41.212]  Yeah, so initially, we didn't publish anything about the dinner.
[01:10:41.212 --> 01:10:44.094]  It was rumored that Ye went to dinner with Trump.
[01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:47.955]  Then it was rumored that I was at the dinner because I walked through the airport in Miami.
[01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:55.258]  Then there was a statement from Jason Miller, who spoke as a representative for Trump, and he said, well, Nick Fuentes was not at the dinner.
[01:10:55.258 --> 01:10:56.959]  And it was only at that point, which was a lie,
[01:10:57.679 --> 01:11:01.442]  It was only at that point when we began to respond and Ye said, he can't say that.
[01:11:01.442 --> 01:11:02.422]  Nick was at the dinner.
[01:11:02.422 --> 01:11:03.383]  That was a lie.
[01:11:03.383 --> 01:11:05.925]  But I mean, I actually like the speeches that Jason Miller wrote.
[01:11:05.925 --> 01:11:07.946]  Maybe, I mean, he was just scared.
[01:11:07.946 --> 01:11:09.147]  Who was scared?
[01:11:09.147 --> 01:11:10.268]  Trump?
[01:11:10.268 --> 01:11:12.429]  No, I mean, I think Miller thinking it was a setup.
[01:11:12.429 --> 01:11:14.491]  But I mean, I think that's what they thought.
[01:11:14.491 --> 01:11:15.732]  They thought, oh, this is a setup.
[01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:18.233]  And I think that's where that fear came from.
[01:11:18.233 --> 01:11:21.394]  But okay, but people gotta stop lying.
[01:11:21.394 --> 01:11:29.096]  Our leaders, our politicians have to stop being afraid and being so political, and we have to put Christ first.
[01:11:29.096 --> 01:11:38.678]  And if anything comes from this, like, the best thing that could come from this is, I'm the President of the United States in 2024.
[01:11:38.678 --> 01:11:45.020]  The worst thing that could come from this is, our leaders are held to Christian values, not Zionist values.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.364]  Now, let's talk about the difference of Trump's truth socials.
[01:11:50.364 --> 01:11:53.606]  Yeah, so he put out three successive posts.
[01:11:53.606 --> 01:12:00.412]  There's three responses from Trump on truth social, and they just get more sort of erratic as the pressure grows.
[01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:03.534]  You know, the first one, he says, it was a very uneventful dinner.
[01:12:03.534 --> 01:12:05.215]  I did meet with Ye.
[01:12:05.215 --> 01:12:10.760]  The next post was, I don't know who Nick Fuentes was, and it was totally uneventful.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:11.741]  The third one, he says,
[01:12:12.421 --> 01:12:17.062]  Ye, a very troubled man who happens to be black, came for badly needed advice.
[01:12:17.062 --> 01:12:21.083]  And so I just kept getting more and more sort of angry and erratic.
[01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:27.005]  And I think what Ye's getting at, I don't want to put words in his mouth, but Trump is surrounded by handlers.
[01:12:27.005 --> 01:12:29.926]  He's surrounded by people like Jared Kushner and Jason Miller.
[01:12:29.926 --> 01:12:31.286]  He's got three campaign managers.
[01:12:31.286 --> 01:12:34.567]  Well, Jared Kushner bailed because he got what he wanted out of Trump, right?
[01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:36.768]  What did Jared do when Trump was in office?
[01:12:37.048 --> 01:12:38.329]  He got the Abraham Accords.
[01:12:38.329 --> 01:12:42.892]  Jared Kushner with his best friend, Bibi Netanyahu, at 666 5th Avenue.
[01:12:42.892 --> 01:12:47.596]  They brokered the Abraham Accords, which opened up investment from the Gulf States into Israel.
[01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:49.597]  What did Netanyahu have to say about it exactly?
[01:12:49.597 --> 01:12:53.400]  Netanyahu loves it, of course, because... But let's expand on that.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.121]  I love Jared!
[01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:55.501]  Hey!
[01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:55.902]  Hey!
[01:12:55.902 --> 01:12:58.403]  This is Netanyahu!
[01:12:58.403 --> 01:12:59.424]  Okay.
[01:12:59.424 --> 01:13:00.285]  Now keep going.
[01:13:00.285 --> 01:13:01.606]  My point is, is that...
[01:13:03.227 --> 01:13:11.391]  It's fair though for Trump that it is a political attack to claim that he endorses or represents even the views they claim you hold that you don't hold.
[01:13:11.391 --> 01:13:15.714]  So clearly you can see how the media is using you guys as an attack on Trump.
[01:13:15.714 --> 01:13:22.957]  They're using us to try to put this guy we've never heard of, DeSantis, in office.
[01:13:22.957 --> 01:13:27.960]  Like, DeSantis is going to play by the book.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.881]  The thing about Trump is this guy is
[01:13:32.711 --> 01:13:34.032]  One of the best presidents we have.
[01:13:34.032 --> 01:13:35.092]  He's top five presidents.
[01:13:35.092 --> 01:13:37.874]  He's right there with Ronald Reagan.
[01:13:37.874 --> 01:13:40.015]  And he was a warden grad.
[01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:42.776]  He's one of the best businessmen of all time.
[01:13:42.776 --> 01:13:48.019]  And the entire time he was the president, the Jewish media attacked him.
[01:13:48.019 --> 01:13:51.721]  They were mad because he was actually working for the country.
[01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:59.625]  And now they're doing everything, including this meeting, to try to say he's not allowed to meet with... This is InfoWars!
[01:14:00.385 --> 01:14:04.788]  Who are you to say who the President can meet with, Netanyahu?
[01:14:04.788 --> 01:14:11.171]  Like, I'm not gonna... The Holy Spirit fills me up, and the less sin I have, the less angry I get, you know?
[01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:25.260]  So, you can't make me angry, but if I was another version of Ye, the Kanye West that you guys know, I would be angry at Netanyahu for even speaking on one of the best Presidents, one of our best Presidents of all times.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.742]  Shut the... Shut the bless up, Netanyahu!
[01:14:29.659 --> 01:14:30.579]  This is from Ye.
[01:14:30.579 --> 01:14:31.560]  Now you know who I am.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.440]  Do you know who I am now, Netanyahu?
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.821]  You know who I am now, Jared Kushner?
[01:14:36.821 --> 01:14:38.521]  You know who I am, Josh Kushner?
[01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:42.002]  Let me tell you something about Softie Josh, right?
[01:14:42.002 --> 01:14:45.623]  Marshmallow Josh, um, was at a dinner.
[01:14:45.623 --> 01:14:48.864]  I'm at Jared's house, Jared and Ivanka's house, and, um,
[01:14:52.424 --> 01:15:03.027]  I didn't realize at the dinner that Josh Kushner had 10% of Skims, which was my ex-wife's clothing line, which I have 5% of.
[01:15:03.027 --> 01:15:09.929]  And it's one of the reasons why, even after the attack where Ari Emanuel had all of my deals destroyed, I was still worth $400 million, right?
[01:15:09.929 --> 01:15:11.989]  And still had $250 million of cash available, right?
[01:15:18.171 --> 01:15:22.433]  Josh, I say, what do you think about Jared working for me in 2024?
[01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:25.514]  And Josh looks at Jared and says, oh, I would kill him.
[01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:28.415]  And so then towards the end of the meeting, I'm leaving their apartment.
[01:15:28.415 --> 01:15:35.538]  They do it like a soft hug, because I think like Jared, as soft as Jared is, he has to hug Josh extra soft.
[01:15:35.538 --> 01:15:38.639]  So, you know, he doesn't melt like toilet paper.
[01:15:38.639 --> 01:15:41.200]  And what I realized afterwards that
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.843]  Josh had 10% of a line that I only had 5% double.
[01:15:46.843 --> 01:15:50.045]  Where I, you know, Skims is an extension of Yeezy.
[01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.606]  It's an extension of my brand.
[01:15:51.606 --> 01:15:56.789]  Literally, I put the creative director from Yeezy at Skims.
[01:15:56.789 --> 01:15:59.871]  Because at first, Skims was a lingerie line.
[01:16:00.271 --> 01:16:04.836]  And then, it was Kris Jenner's idea to make it a shapewear line, and I said, I have the perfect person.
[01:16:04.836 --> 01:16:16.989]  Let's take these elements of Yeezy, and let's put this here, and then Josh goes in and puts $150 million from some investment firm to then control something that my ex-wife was making for our children.
[01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:17.350]  No, I get it.
[01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:20.793]  So you're at this meeting and literally realizing, oh my God, I own this and ran this.
[01:16:20.793 --> 01:16:21.995]  This guy's double what I get.
[01:16:22.515 --> 01:16:23.956]  You didn't even know he was the owner!
[01:16:23.956 --> 01:16:25.396]  Yeah, and that's what I explained to Jared.
[01:16:25.396 --> 01:16:26.257]  I was on text with Jared.
[01:16:26.257 --> 01:16:32.399]  I said, what if I had 10% of a line with Ivanka, and you didn't know, and you only had 5%?
[01:16:32.399 --> 01:16:37.141]  I'm sure you... But what if he learned you own 10% of 666 Park Avenue?
[01:16:37.141 --> 01:16:37.822]  He'd be pissed.
[01:16:37.822 --> 01:16:47.026]  Or what if I had 10% of that 800... How big was the deal that he did after he got out of... So what you're saying is we need reparations from Hollywood.
[01:16:47.606 --> 01:16:50.027]  We need the Hollywood elite that have almost all the money.
[01:16:50.027 --> 01:16:51.728]  They need reparations to America.
[01:16:51.728 --> 01:16:57.510]  Wait, I want to talk about how Jared did that first deal with Netanyahu.
[01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:58.870]  Yeah, he got billions.
[01:16:58.870 --> 01:17:01.611]  And this is something that was covered in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:17:01.611 --> 01:17:05.052]  Jared Kushner brokered the Abraham Accords with Netanyahu.
[01:17:05.052 --> 01:17:10.094]  And before Trump was even out of office, they were arranging for how Kushner could take a massive fee from him.
[01:17:10.094 --> 01:17:14.579]  Well yeah, but separate from Kushner getting money, I don't like Kushner, he glows in the dark, he's creepy as hell.
[01:17:14.579 --> 01:17:19.624]  But I mean, that's a good peace deal to get the Arabs and Jews to quit killing each other.
[01:17:19.624 --> 01:17:25.109]  But I agree with you to some extent, but don't- I mean actually, that's a pretty- I said, that's something good Kushner did.
[01:17:25.109 --> 01:17:28.132]  I mean, I don't like Kushner, but I mean- He did it for the money.
[01:17:28.132 --> 01:17:31.596]  Well, but I mean, we got things- And I would say- I'm not defending him!
[01:17:31.596 --> 01:17:33.278]  I'm saying, isn't it good to try to get Middle East peace?
[01:17:36.485 --> 01:17:37.686]  Let's ask Nick.
[01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.087]  Yeah, Nick, go ahead.
[01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:45.631]  If you want Middle East peace, you have to go to Israel, because Israel is the one who has been bombing Syria.
[01:17:45.631 --> 01:17:49.153]  Israel's the one that's- And they got 200 nuclear weapons, they ain't going nowhere.
[01:17:49.153 --> 01:17:55.516]  Exactly, and that's why they killed JFK and RFK, was because of, they were trying to get their WMD program off the ground.
[01:17:55.516 --> 01:18:00.780]  Operation Apollo, it was Jack Kennedy that wanted IAEA inspectors looking into it.
[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:05.663]  No, and that is probably one of the main, that's one of the reasons Kennedy got killed, that was- What we need to say right now,
[01:18:06.423 --> 01:18:09.304]  And we're going to bring Ali on in a second.
[01:18:09.304 --> 01:18:11.745]  Both of my parents were educators, right?
[01:18:11.745 --> 01:18:14.267]  And we're here as the educators.
[01:18:14.267 --> 01:18:14.967]  That's what's in our heart.
[01:18:14.967 --> 01:18:19.069]  When we get the information, we put ourselves at risk to give you the information.
[01:18:19.069 --> 01:18:25.592]  There's a lot of teachers, incredibly intelligent people that have been canceled and kicked out of universities for not...
[01:18:26.232 --> 01:18:27.733]  Playing along with the system.
[01:18:27.733 --> 01:18:32.437]  So stop looking at us like celebrities, like we're trying to get media.
[01:18:32.437 --> 01:18:40.484]  We're using our position, putting our finances, putting our personal well-being at risk to say the truth out loud.
[01:18:40.484 --> 01:18:49.751]  And I was on the plane with Nick and I said, it feels like we're in Vietnam in the middle of the war with our backs to the wall, holding our guns and saying, you know, Nick, how did you get here?
[01:18:49.751 --> 01:18:50.051]  Yeah.
[01:18:50.051 --> 01:18:50.772]  How did you get here?
[01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:56.376]  Well, all the guns are going off and all the media is going off and say this is InfoWars, right?
[01:18:56.376 --> 01:19:00.199]  So you got some InfoWarriors on both sides of you and you fought for us.
[01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:09.025]  You've been fighting this battle for a long time, Alex, and we just got to salute you as a Christian and as American because you paved the way to make braver soldiers like us today.
[01:19:09.025 --> 01:19:12.388]  It's like Terminator Part 10 happening right now.
[01:19:12.388 --> 01:19:12.528]  Wow.
[01:19:12.528 --> 01:19:13.088]  All right.
[01:19:13.088 --> 01:19:13.829]  We got to go to break.
[01:19:13.829 --> 01:19:15.270]  We're going to get Laura Loomer on.
[01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:16.711]  We're going to get Olly Alexander on.
[01:19:16.711 --> 01:19:19.233]  The man who comes on is one of the smartest guys I know in politics.
[01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:20.954]  And we're going to just continue.
[01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:21.995]  Owen Troyer is going to come on.
[01:19:21.995 --> 01:19:23.957]  We're going to continue on as long as you guys want to go.
[01:19:23.957 --> 01:19:27.801]  We'll take breaks and stuff too and get, you know, yay to eat something or whatever.
[01:19:27.801 --> 01:19:29.643]  Me and Nick got something he hasn't eaten yet.
[01:19:29.643 --> 01:19:31.765]  I stay fasting.
[01:19:31.765 --> 01:19:32.746]  He just, that's right, he won't eat.
[01:19:32.746 --> 01:19:33.787]  I'm trying to get him to eat.
[01:19:33.787 --> 01:19:34.808]  So I'm like, I'm like an Italian.
[01:19:34.808 --> 01:19:35.369]  Mangia, mangia.
[01:19:37.609 --> 01:19:43.470]  I gotta watch my accounts because they've been frozen by Jewish banks.
[01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:45.851]  So, I need to watch my mails.
[01:19:45.851 --> 01:19:53.112]  Well, CNN says white people are evil Nazis, so... I mean, I disagree with both statements, but I get the... Yeah, I don't like the word evil next to Nazis.
[01:19:53.112 --> 01:19:57.533]  I think we need to look at... Oh my goodness.
[01:19:57.533 --> 01:20:00.133]  Just because you don't like one group doesn't mean the other.
[01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:02.774]  I love Jewish people, but I also love Nazis.
[01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:06.067]  Oh man!
[01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.728]  Well, I have to disagree with that.
[01:20:07.728 --> 01:20:12.110]  But listen, we're going to go to break.
[01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:12.931]  I'm the crazy one here.
[01:20:12.931 --> 01:20:13.571]  We're all crazy.
[01:20:13.571 --> 01:20:14.992]  The whole world's crazy.
[01:20:14.992 --> 01:20:16.853]  And the whole power structure's coming down.
[01:20:16.853 --> 01:20:18.794]  This is absolutely lit.
[01:20:18.794 --> 01:20:21.596]  This is lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit.
[01:20:21.596 --> 01:20:22.937]  Number one show in the world right now.
[01:20:22.937 --> 01:20:24.518]  Everybody's tuning in everywhere.
[01:20:24.518 --> 01:20:25.278]  Yay!
[01:20:25.278 --> 01:20:26.559]  Everybody, I appreciate you being here.
[01:20:26.559 --> 01:20:27.119]  We're going to go to break.
[01:20:27.119 --> 01:20:29.981]  We're going to come back and play that little favorite promo with yay.
[01:20:29.981 --> 01:20:32.923]  And then we're going to air the Trudeau clip and then go right back to yay.
[01:20:32.923 --> 01:20:33.323]  Stay with us.
[01:20:35.256 --> 01:20:36.657]  Yay is in studio.
[01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:37.698]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:37.698 --> 01:20:42.463]  Nick Fuentes, Ali Alexander, Owen Schroer are about to join us riding shotgun.
[01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:45.505]  Yay doesn't want to wear an earpiece, so he's going to call Laura Loomer.
[01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:51.191]  Yeah, so we're going to put Laura Loomer on the way she was originally going to be on earlier.
[01:20:51.191 --> 01:20:52.432]  Yay, you're hosting the show.
[01:20:52.432 --> 01:20:55.034]  Go ahead.
[01:20:55.034 --> 01:20:56.816]  Laura, can you guys hear Laura on the mic?
[01:21:00.603 --> 01:21:02.224]  What they're doing is they're talking to her out there.
[01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.444]  I told them 45 minutes ago.
[01:21:03.444 --> 01:21:04.665]  Laura, can I hear you on the mic?
[01:21:04.665 --> 01:21:05.505]  Tell her you're going to call her.
[01:21:05.505 --> 01:21:06.906]  They didn't do that because it's such a party.
[01:21:06.906 --> 01:21:08.327]  I can hear you.
[01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:11.949]  Can you guys hear her?
[01:21:11.949 --> 01:21:14.630]  Laura, say something.
[01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:16.151]  Is this Laura Loomer?
[01:21:16.151 --> 01:21:16.611]  Yeah, Laura.
[01:21:16.611 --> 01:21:17.171]  You're on the air.
[01:21:17.171 --> 01:21:19.252]  Go ahead.
[01:21:19.252 --> 01:21:20.253]  How's it going?
[01:21:20.253 --> 01:21:21.113]  You're on the air with Ye.
[01:21:21.113 --> 01:21:21.453]  Go ahead.
[01:21:21.453 --> 01:21:22.594]  He wants to do it over his speakerphone.
[01:21:22.594 --> 01:21:22.854]  Go ahead.
[01:21:25.279 --> 01:21:27.920]  Well, look, I just wanted to call in.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:46.745]  You know, I see that everybody on this stream has been cancelled in some fashion and, you know, I've also been cancelled and, you know, I have a unique perspective because, you know, I'm Jewish and I happen to be one of the most banned and censored people in this country and so
[01:21:47.765 --> 01:22:04.231]  I just wanted to talk about cancel culture and the act of debanking and deplatforming from my perspective because I was really one of the first people that experienced all of this cancel culture and I would just say that
[01:22:05.895 --> 01:22:12.060]  You know, I can sympathize with anybody who's had their voice silenced.
[01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:22.428]  I don't think that censorship is the answer, no matter how much you disagree with another person or how offensive you may find their statements or their arguments to be.
[01:22:22.428 --> 01:22:26.231]  And what we need in this country is more free speech.
[01:22:26.231 --> 01:22:27.012]  And I say that
[01:22:28.393 --> 01:22:41.121]  As a Jewish American woman watching this stream and watching the plague of cancel culture that has really swept not just our country but the entire world over these last few years.
[01:22:41.121 --> 01:22:45.623]  And I will say that being Jewish has never saved me from being canceled.
[01:22:45.623 --> 01:22:50.366]  It never stopped the banks from shutting down my access to my bank account.
[01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:51.267]  Being Jewish never
[01:22:52.107 --> 01:23:18.456]  You know prevented me from becoming like I said the most banned woman in the world, so I just wanted to make it clear that you know while You know there's no disputing the fact that groups like the ADL and AIPAC and you know powerful You know left-wing Jewish individuals and in some cases right-wing Jewish individuals themselves are advocating for cancel culture There are Jews themselves who have also been canceled
[01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:21.078]  Yeah, you shouldn't be penalized for what other people have done.
[01:23:21.078 --> 01:23:22.779]  Martin Luther King said that, and I agree with it.
[01:23:22.779 --> 01:23:27.003]  So yeah, you called yourself more like Martin Luther King the other day than Malcolm X. I tend to agree with that.
[01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.884]  I like Malcolm X. I've read his writings, listened to him.
[01:23:28.884 --> 01:23:30.525]  Incredibly smart intellectual.
[01:23:30.525 --> 01:23:31.386]  He was downtrodden.
[01:23:31.386 --> 01:23:32.567]  He was telling people to stand up.
[01:23:32.567 --> 01:23:35.990]  He was an amazing revolutionary for his time, an amazing man.
[01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:41.013]  But I think Martin Luther King was more powerful, and even Malcolm came around to his worldview of thinking.
[01:23:41.013 --> 01:23:44.676]  So my issue is, it's the same thing we're talking about here, is that
[01:23:45.737 --> 01:23:53.582]  You know, Laura Loomer has been censored, Laura Loomer has been attacked, and Israel has the most draconian COVID shots against their population of any group.
[01:23:53.582 --> 01:23:55.943]  So I'm saying, why aren't they exempt?
[01:23:55.943 --> 01:24:04.008]  Because there's a criminal group posing as them, Christ talked about this, that is trying to manipulate and pose as the leadership of every group.
[01:24:04.008 --> 01:24:07.109]  There's groups that claim they lead the black folks that aren't caring about blacks.
[01:24:07.109 --> 01:24:09.751]  There's groups that claim they care about white people that aren't really caring.
[01:24:09.751 --> 01:24:11.552]  There's groups that claim they're Jewish that don't.
[01:24:11.552 --> 01:24:12.873]  I think that's really what we're talking about.
[01:24:12.873 --> 01:24:13.293]  Do you disagree?
[01:24:14.307 --> 01:24:14.907]  I agree.
[01:24:14.907 --> 01:24:20.409]  And as I think about it, I gotta say, I love the Zionist.
[01:24:20.409 --> 01:24:26.732]  I love the people that blocked my bank account because God runs the world and uses everyone.
[01:24:26.732 --> 01:24:31.934]  There's a power structure under God that starts with the thousand-year-old families, such as the Medici's.
[01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:37.556]  Then it goes to the Vatican, which is in bloodline to Peter, not Paul.
[01:24:38.528 --> 01:24:46.771]  Then it goes to the financial groups, BlackRock, Vanguard, and then to the governments, where we can go into Putin territory.
[01:24:46.771 --> 01:24:50.392]  And then it goes to Hollywood, the Rahm Emanuel.
[01:24:50.392 --> 01:24:53.293]  That is the first smokescreen to get passed.
[01:24:53.293 --> 01:24:55.394]  And we're just breaking down those smokescreens.
[01:24:55.394 --> 01:24:58.295]  Hey, Ari, how you doing, Ari?
[01:24:58.295 --> 01:24:59.275]  Hey, I will.
[01:24:59.275 --> 01:25:07.238]  I want to jump in really quick, and I will say... Yeah, Lori, you're on the air.
[01:25:09.525 --> 01:25:18.311]  I'm searching the blacklisting of people like Ye, people like Alex Jones, people like Nick Fuentes, people like myself.
[01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:27.117]  Everybody watching should understand we're living in a dangerous time now where people are being shut down and having their money frozen.
[01:25:27.117 --> 01:25:33.802]  Imagine not being able to access your bank account because somebody in a boardroom decides that they don't agree with what you're saying.
[01:25:34.222 --> 01:25:43.765]  And so, you know, for people who are critical, you know, of Yay, Nick, Alex, myself, or whoever, right?
[01:25:43.765 --> 01:25:45.826]  Just think of how fast the tables could turn.
[01:25:45.826 --> 01:25:48.387]  And I think this is what you've been talking about for years, Alex.
[01:25:48.387 --> 01:25:51.528]  You've been warning people about what's coming for years.
[01:25:51.528 --> 01:25:54.949]  And now people want to act like, oh, well, how did we get to this point?
[01:25:54.949 --> 01:25:58.370]  Censorship is the reason why we've got to this point.
[01:25:58.370 --> 01:25:58.810]  Okay?
[01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:02.651]  So, you know, these things wouldn't be happening if people weren't being censored.
[01:26:02.771 --> 01:26:04.231]  Well sure Laura, can I ask you this question?
[01:26:04.231 --> 01:26:11.594]  Because you're a smart, successful, pro-America Jewish lady that's an American that lives in Florida.
[01:26:11.594 --> 01:26:19.696]  From my experience studying what goes on in politics, aren't Jews like everybody else, like left-wing, right-wing, and different factions fighting with each other and everybody else like any other group?
[01:26:19.696 --> 01:26:22.197]  I mean I understand there's powerful groups in Hollywood and all these mafias.
[01:26:22.657 --> 01:26:25.799]  But it's like, we don't blame Italians for the Italian Mafia.
[01:26:25.799 --> 01:26:33.685]  And when I criticize the Jewish Mafia, which is one of the most powerful in the world, which I don't like, I don't dislike because they have to be Jewish, because they're a Mafia.
[01:26:33.685 --> 01:26:38.669]  That's really how I think we destigmatize it, is just say no to the Mafia that is the ADL in Hollywood.
[01:26:38.669 --> 01:26:40.931]  Or do you disagree with that, or agree, or you want to say something?
[01:26:41.631 --> 01:26:44.734]  Look, there's factions within any group, alright?
[01:26:44.734 --> 01:26:47.736]  I don't think that you can really generalize any group.
[01:26:47.736 --> 01:26:53.601]  I think that when you look at the demographics of Jews in America, over 73% of Jews vote Democrat.
[01:26:53.601 --> 01:27:01.548]  And so when you see a lot of people making decisions who happen to be Jewish, it's coming from a left-wing perspective.
[01:27:01.548 --> 01:27:03.310]  But I'm a nationalist, you know?
[01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:07.073]  I'm a nationalist and I'm Jewish and I've been a very strong supporter of
[01:27:07.793 --> 01:27:08.573]  And that's the question.
[01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:09.893]  Why were they so scared of you?
[01:27:09.893 --> 01:27:12.534]  Because you've been as much banned as me or even more.
[01:27:12.534 --> 01:27:14.674]  I mean, they have come after you.
[01:27:14.674 --> 01:27:17.975]  Why are they scared of Laura Loomer?
[01:27:17.975 --> 01:27:20.235]  Because I'm a free speech absolutist.
[01:27:20.235 --> 01:27:35.938]  And regardless of what somebody may say, even whatever they may say about Jews or whatever they may have to say about Israel or Judaism, I'm not going to advocate for anybody to be silenced, anybody to be banned, or anybody to have their accounts shut down or their money frozen.
[01:27:36.258 --> 01:27:38.059]  Simply because of their viewpoints.
[01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:41.981]  This is America and we need to promote free speech absolutism.
[01:27:41.981 --> 01:27:46.383]  And we need our politicians to start promoting free speech absolutism.
[01:27:46.383 --> 01:27:50.165]  And this is what I ran for Congress twice in Florida.
[01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:54.867]  The first time in Trump's home district, which was actually the most Jewish district in the country.
[01:27:54.867 --> 01:27:56.788]  And then most recently in District 11.
[01:27:56.788 --> 01:27:58.189]  You know, I ran on a campaign
[01:28:00.111 --> 01:28:00.892]  No, I know you do.
[01:28:00.892 --> 01:28:05.195]  So what about a First Amendment or a Bill of Rights party?
[01:28:05.195 --> 01:28:07.957]  You know, that could transcend party lines.
[01:28:07.957 --> 01:28:12.300]  What about a free speech, pro-self-defense, a First Amendment, Second Amendment party?
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:15.523]  I mean, how do we fix this, Yay?
[01:28:15.523 --> 01:28:18.325]  We fix this with the Word of Christ.
[01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:21.427]  The first book of Moses called Genesis.
[01:28:21.427 --> 01:28:24.750]  In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:38.831]  The earth was without form and void, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
[01:28:38.831 --> 01:28:39.592]  That's where we start.
[01:28:41.118 --> 01:28:43.261]  They know that, that's why Prometheus shows that.
[01:28:43.261 --> 01:28:44.963]  Alright, Laura, thank you so much.
[01:28:44.963 --> 01:28:46.745]  Thank you.
[01:28:46.745 --> 01:28:47.806]  Closing comments or yay?
[01:28:47.806 --> 01:28:49.168]  I want to move on to Ali and folks.
[01:28:49.168 --> 01:28:50.869]  Laura, thank you very much for calling in.
[01:28:50.869 --> 01:28:51.450]  Talk later.
[01:28:51.450 --> 01:28:51.931]  Thanks a lot.
[01:28:51.931 --> 01:28:53.673]  Alright, so good.
[01:28:53.673 --> 01:28:55.094]  That's good.
[01:28:55.094 --> 01:28:55.895]  Great, Nick, you're up.
[01:28:56.636 --> 01:28:57.916]  Nick, I'll see you in Florida.
[01:28:57.916 --> 01:29:00.737]  You want to say something before we go to Ali, Alexander, and Owen?
[01:29:00.737 --> 01:29:04.678]  Yeah, I want to jump in and say that I agree.
[01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:07.179]  I think, though, that it's not so much about the Bill of Rights.
[01:29:07.179 --> 01:29:09.240]  I think it's really more about Christianity.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.381]  I think that what America needs is a Christian party.
[01:29:12.381 --> 01:29:13.101]  Oh, I agree.
[01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:14.982]  Politically, it's about our freedoms.
[01:29:14.982 --> 01:29:15.582]  But you're right.
[01:29:15.582 --> 01:29:16.282]  Christ is first.
[01:29:16.562 --> 01:29:23.504]  Right, and it gets to the nature of Judaism, which is the fact that Jews do not believe that Christ was the Son of God.
[01:29:23.504 --> 01:29:26.585]  And in fact, they're the only group that hate Jesus.
[01:29:26.585 --> 01:29:28.965]  Muslims see Jesus as a prophet.
[01:29:28.965 --> 01:29:32.246]  Buddhists, Hindus see Jesus as a spiritual figure.
[01:29:32.246 --> 01:29:35.767]  Jews write in their Talmud that Christ is burning in hell.
[01:29:35.767 --> 01:29:36.927]  They don't like the cross.
[01:29:36.927 --> 01:29:39.148]  Well, I think that's because he was kind of taking over the thing.
[01:29:39.148 --> 01:29:42.649]  So at the end of the day, we worship a Jew, or we say he's not really a Jew.
[01:29:43.504 --> 01:29:50.072]  It's not the same thing, though, because the kind of Judaism that we have now is not of the Old Testament, it's of the rabbinical oral tradition.
[01:29:50.072 --> 01:29:54.577]  So these people are worshipping... They're not following the Old Testament, they're following the Zohar and the Talmud and all that.
[01:29:54.577 --> 01:29:55.698]  That's right, exactly.
[01:29:55.698 --> 01:29:58.502]  So, I mean, people should read that for themselves.
[01:29:58.502 --> 01:29:59.563]  What about Holly Selassie?
[01:29:59.563 --> 01:30:02.747]  Because this is what happened to Kyrie Irving, and it made me really mad, because
[01:30:02.967 --> 01:30:06.211]  When I was a kid growing up reading comic books and stuff, I could read really early.
[01:30:06.211 --> 01:30:08.273]  When I was like 5, I could read like a 10-year-old.
[01:30:08.273 --> 01:30:10.255]  When I was 10, I could read like a college student.
[01:30:10.255 --> 01:30:14.039]  And so I put down comic books when I was about 8, because my mom had all these history books.
[01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:16.923]  Some of them were picture history books, but I started reading those.
[01:30:16.923 --> 01:30:20.166]  And it's like a fact that Solomon married a bunch of black women.
[01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.369]  It's a fact that Ethiopia was Jewish.
[01:30:22.369 --> 01:30:24.311]  It's a fact that North Africa was Jewish.
[01:30:24.771 --> 01:30:39.183]  It's a fact that that went on and that Kyrie Irving puts out a video explaining that a bunch of North African blacks are intermarried and part Jewish and Israel lets a bunch of blacks in because they can prove that their lineage, their names are Jewish names.
[01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:40.504]  So how is it anti-Semitic?
[01:30:41.164 --> 01:30:54.730]  And how does the ADL say it's anti-Semitic for black people who are related directly to King Solomon and King David, the line of Judah, which Haile Selassie was the leader of Ethiopia, that's where this whole movement comes from, to act like they don't know this.
[01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:57.812]  I'm not blaming Jews for this, I'm blaming the leftist ADL.
[01:30:57.812 --> 01:31:03.214]  To deny black Jews their heritage is a historic fraud.
[01:31:03.214 --> 01:31:04.555]  It's a damn historic fact!
[01:31:04.555 --> 01:31:05.715]  It's on Wikipedia!
[01:31:05.715 --> 01:31:06.556]  It's not even debated!
[01:31:07.492 --> 01:31:10.054]  It's true, but it's not just the leftists, it's the right-wing ones, too.
[01:31:10.054 --> 01:31:18.822]  You know, because in Israel, Yehusha showed me a clip the other day where they are racist towards the Sudanese or Ethiopian black Jews that immigrate into Israel.
[01:31:18.822 --> 01:31:20.284]  They kick them out, there's quotas.
[01:31:20.284 --> 01:31:22.506]  Well, I mean, Israel's even mean to the Hasidic Jews now.
[01:31:22.506 --> 01:31:23.246]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:31:23.246 --> 01:31:23.847]  They're waging war.
[01:31:24.227 --> 01:31:28.568]  Right, so, and I agree with you, and what they've done to Kyrie Irving is just disgusting.
[01:31:28.568 --> 01:31:31.149]  Hey, that is a link, a beautiful person, wonderful guy.
[01:31:31.149 --> 01:31:35.250]  He'll tell you, he goes, yeah, what runs Israel is evil and so is your groups.
[01:31:35.250 --> 01:31:40.511]  Ben Shapiro just mad that Kyrie won't sign his basketball.
[01:31:40.511 --> 01:31:42.332]  Back to you, Nick.
[01:31:42.332 --> 01:31:43.672]  So what about that issue?
[01:31:43.672 --> 01:31:47.373]  I'm sure you know about Hailem Selassie and Kyrie Irving.
[01:31:47.373 --> 01:31:48.153]  Your take on Kyrie?
[01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:50.941]  That's my brother.
[01:31:50.941 --> 01:32:05.816]  And I love the fact that just like now, it felt like you were in this battle by yourself, but now you got two warriors alongside of you, like gargoyles at the top of the buildings in New York, ready to fight for Christ.
[01:32:05.816 --> 01:32:13.303]  And when Kyrie put up that information, they always want to write me off and say, yay, it's just so crazy, so crazy, so crazy.
[01:32:14.003 --> 01:32:15.284]  They don't want independence.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.342]  I agree.
[01:32:44.342 --> 01:32:47.586]  And Kyrie fought for something.
[01:32:47.586 --> 01:32:49.669]  And then also, you know, for me...
[01:32:50.949 --> 01:32:52.690]  Well, Kyrie, I love Kyrie.
[01:32:52.690 --> 01:32:54.830]  He did what his job was.
[01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:57.491]  They had the Hebrew Israelites in front of the game.
[01:32:57.491 --> 01:33:00.492]  And now the high schools, I always think about the high schools.
[01:33:00.492 --> 01:33:04.313]  I always think about the future, the grammar schools, the high schools.
[01:33:04.313 --> 01:33:06.573]  These are the people that are going to change our lives.
[01:33:06.573 --> 01:33:09.374]  So the high schools are asking questions.
[01:33:09.374 --> 01:33:12.995]  People are running around saying, oh, yay, it's racist.
[01:33:12.995 --> 01:33:15.936]  What is the term racism was created?
[01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:20.739]  And I think the construct of racism was created.
[01:33:20.739 --> 01:33:21.980]  The communist Russians.
[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:22.680]  Yeah!
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:28.984]  And it's like the whole woke culture, the idea of the white man did this, the Jewish guy did this.
[01:33:28.984 --> 01:33:30.665]  Now I'm saying specifically the bankers.
[01:33:30.665 --> 01:33:33.107]  I think my misstep in the tweet
[01:33:33.747 --> 01:33:53.617]  Was to pinpoint a people as a point as opposed to pinpointing the devil and the fact that the devil used to have that but more than that It was my disobedience to God that forced me into the whale stomach as I am right now But it's only my obedience to God that's gonna bring me out of the whale stomach
[01:33:53.677 --> 01:33:54.277]  Well, let's elaborate.
[01:33:54.277 --> 01:33:55.698]  You're not walking back what you said.
[01:33:55.698 --> 01:33:58.099]  You are clarifying it, which is key.
[01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:00.560]  It's evil in the hearts of men and women that's the problem.
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:01.821]  And so you're not walking it back.
[01:34:01.821 --> 01:34:02.521]  You're clarifying.
[01:34:02.521 --> 01:34:03.021]  This is Biggs.
[01:34:03.021 --> 01:34:03.901]  Let's clarify.
[01:34:03.901 --> 01:34:05.842]  Satan?
[01:34:05.842 --> 01:34:07.823]  The angel.
[01:34:07.823 --> 01:34:10.104]  God's one of his favorite angels.
[01:34:10.104 --> 01:34:11.685]  One of the most powerful angels.
[01:34:11.685 --> 01:34:12.485]  The most powerful.
[01:34:12.485 --> 01:34:13.306]  Yeah.
[01:34:13.306 --> 01:34:13.606]  Satan.
[01:34:13.606 --> 01:34:14.226]  That's what I like.
[01:34:14.226 --> 01:34:15.987]  The most powerful angel.
[01:34:15.987 --> 01:34:16.687]  Satan.
[01:34:16.687 --> 01:34:19.088]  And he brought angels with him when he left heaven, right?
[01:34:19.088 --> 01:34:20.989]  How many angels did Satan bring with him?
[01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:21.729]  33% of them.
[01:34:21.729 --> 01:34:23.190]  So he brought billions of angels with him.
[01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:31.213]  So angels, Satan has 33% of God's warriors with him, working for Satan.
[01:34:31.213 --> 01:34:34.073]  But God runs the world.
[01:34:34.073 --> 01:34:41.256]  And it's Satan that gets inside of the Zionists and makes them do evil things.
[01:34:41.256 --> 01:34:43.917]  These are stories, because I'm a baby Christian, right?
[01:34:43.917 --> 01:34:44.577]  But I heard that
[01:34:45.552 --> 01:34:47.555]  You know, God loves me so much.
[01:34:47.555 --> 01:34:49.197]  He loves me so much, right?
[01:34:49.197 --> 01:34:52.141]  Then, I go to Drink Champs, and I'm drinking.
[01:34:52.141 --> 01:34:54.064]  And the Bible says, King, don't drink.
[01:34:54.064 --> 01:34:54.384]  Right?
[01:34:54.384 --> 01:35:00.553]  I know it's not, Milo, I know I'm not saying it in correct, perfect English, but the Bible says, King, don't drink.
[01:35:01.253 --> 01:35:10.461]  And I'm drinking, and I'm smoking, and I'm using my ego, because I'm tired of, I'm tired of these like, fed, uh... They're like, I'm lit!
[01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:11.021]  I'm lit!
[01:35:11.021 --> 01:35:16.285]  Let me say, I'm tired of these fed celebrities trying to pick on me, thinking that they gangster.
[01:35:16.285 --> 01:35:18.247]  We're not in high school, Meek Mills.
[01:35:18.247 --> 01:35:20.189]  We're not in high school, Puff Daddy.
[01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:23.872]  And everyone thinks that they're so much more gangster, like they got me in some way.
[01:35:24.512 --> 01:35:27.775]  Ain't none of y'all more gangster than God, and God got me.
[01:35:27.775 --> 01:35:28.916]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:35:28.916 --> 01:35:32.099]  And I'm saying that... Oh no, everybody posing acting tough is nothing to me.
[01:35:32.099 --> 01:35:35.822]  You talk about rebel black sheep, I mean, you're definitely it, buddy.
[01:35:35.822 --> 01:35:42.388]  Yeah, y'all not tough to me, but I'm drinking, and then I start saying stuff that doesn't please God, right?
[01:35:42.388 --> 01:35:46.691]  It wasn't the Zionists, it wasn't the banks, it's God sent me back, but the fact that
[01:35:47.472 --> 01:35:55.258]  The fact that I still had 400 million and Forbes couldn't get around it, it showed God loves me, but he just had to set me back a little.
[01:35:55.258 --> 01:35:56.659]  Well, it's a Jobian proverb.
[01:35:56.659 --> 01:35:58.160]  You're going through a Jobian trial.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.443]  Yeah, because since I lost my wife, right?
[01:36:01.443 --> 01:36:13.432]  Since I lost my family and I was no longer the priest right in the middle of that home and I didn't have the say-so over the content that my kids watch and what they wore and where they went to school and how we went to church and what they ate.
[01:36:13.992 --> 01:36:16.934]  I was frustrated and I let the devil come and get me.
[01:36:16.934 --> 01:36:18.696]  I let the devil pull me in.
[01:36:18.696 --> 01:36:24.200]  Next thing you know, I'm at New Year's Eve parties having threesomes.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:27.062]  God was so mad at me.
[01:36:27.062 --> 01:36:29.284]  He said, I empowered you.
[01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.406]  I gave you every skill set.
[01:36:31.846 --> 01:36:35.889]  You're like Moses, you saved Caesar's life in battle, twice!
[01:36:35.889 --> 01:36:41.192]  You know, you might stutter, you might not be the best communicator, but you're a leader, yeah?
[01:36:41.192 --> 01:36:43.874]  And you're down there, you're not representing me.
[01:36:43.874 --> 01:36:47.456]  You're drinking, you're having sex, and you know what?
[01:36:47.456 --> 01:36:50.798]  And God, He waited on me, He let me go, you know?
[01:36:51.518 --> 01:37:01.868]  Eight months into the year, but it wasn't till I bragged about serving Satan with the actions that God said, I got to set you back now and set you straight.
[01:37:01.868 --> 01:37:04.351]  And then so we're moving my school.
[01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:06.213]  We're moving the Donda theology.
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:17.195]  Engineering University into a church and we were there talking with the pastor and then a homeless gentleman came in and was talking to us and I said, is this a plant?
[01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:22.183]  I don't know, but this is the greatest theologist that I've met and I had him come to a Bible study.
[01:37:23.223 --> 01:37:26.065]  We were working on the Walk to the House.
[01:37:26.065 --> 01:37:27.706]  I don't like to call it a campaign.
[01:37:27.706 --> 01:37:28.886]  We're working to the Walk to the House.
[01:37:28.886 --> 01:37:29.467]  Hold on.
[01:37:29.467 --> 01:37:30.727]  This is a hard break at the end of the hour.
[01:37:30.727 --> 01:37:32.008]  Stations, rejoin us.
[01:37:32.008 --> 01:37:32.688]  I skipped the other break.
[01:37:32.688 --> 01:37:33.329]  We've got to have this.
[01:37:33.329 --> 01:37:34.329]  We're back in two minutes.
[01:37:34.329 --> 01:37:35.750]  We've got to do this hard break.
[01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:38.412]  And I ask, do you want to put a website out where people can actually hear what you have to say?
[01:37:38.412 --> 01:37:41.013]  I want you to remind me what I'm saying so I can give this explanation.
[01:37:41.013 --> 01:37:41.373]  No, no.
[01:37:41.373 --> 01:37:43.514]  You told me on the phone the story.
[01:37:43.514 --> 01:37:44.695]  I need to tell the people though.
[01:37:44.935 --> 01:37:45.455]  No, you will.
[01:37:45.455 --> 01:37:46.576]  I'm going to remember.
[01:37:46.576 --> 01:37:48.358]  It's the amazing homeless guy comes in.
[01:37:48.358 --> 01:37:48.558]  Yeah.
[01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:50.039]  And he gives you this incredible word.
[01:37:50.039 --> 01:37:51.180]  I don't care about the website.
[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:53.262]  I care about Jesus Christ and people knowing that.
[01:37:53.262 --> 01:37:55.524]  I get it, but they also got to know where to actually find what you're actually saying.
[01:37:55.524 --> 01:37:58.266]  No, the only place to find it is in the Bible.
[01:37:58.266 --> 01:38:00.708]  My website is the Bible.
[01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.009]  Nick, where do people find what you're doing?
[01:38:02.449 --> 01:38:05.492]  Cozy.tv slash Nick and the Bible.
[01:38:05.492 --> 01:38:05.993]  All right.
[01:38:05.993 --> 01:38:06.533]  All right.
[01:38:06.533 --> 01:38:07.314]  I'm just trying to like.
[01:38:07.314 --> 01:38:07.975]  All right.
[01:38:07.975 --> 01:38:09.336]  Hey, it's all about free speech.
[01:38:09.336 --> 01:38:09.997]  We'll be right back.
[01:38:09.997 --> 01:38:12.079]  Hour number three with Ye and so many more.
[01:38:12.079 --> 01:38:18.525]  And we've got Owen Schroyer and Ali Alexander loaded, ready to go in the other studio, 10 feet through that wall.
[01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:19.826]  So they're coming up.
[01:38:19.826 --> 01:38:23.370]  Hour number three of the most banned broadcast in the world.
[01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:24.091]  Straight ahead.
[01:38:33.254 --> 01:38:35.517]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[01:38:35.517 --> 01:38:38.179]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[01:38:38.179 --> 01:38:43.966]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[01:38:43.966 --> 01:38:48.471]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[01:38:48.471 --> 01:38:50.573]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[01:38:50.573 --> 01:38:54.738]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[01:38:55.018 --> 01:39:00.945]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and Bio-True Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:05.110]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:39:06.124 --> 01:39:11.946]  So many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vazo Beats, Secret 12.
[01:39:11.946 --> 01:39:16.287]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[01:39:16.287 --> 01:39:18.847]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[01:39:18.847 --> 01:39:23.209]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarestore.com.
[01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:29.930]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off your already giant savings at infowarestore.com.
[01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.231]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:31.631]  God bless.
[01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:42.433]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[01:39:42.433 --> 01:39:44.955]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[01:39:44.955 --> 01:39:48.618]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[01:39:48.618 --> 01:39:49.679]  Where do we say that?
[01:39:49.679 --> 01:39:50.439]  We never said that.
[01:39:50.439 --> 01:39:52.741]  They just say we said that.
[01:39:54.013 --> 01:39:55.074]  But where's the clip?
[01:39:55.074 --> 01:39:56.194]  Where's the article?
[01:39:56.194 --> 01:39:56.935]  Where do we say that?
[01:39:56.935 --> 01:39:58.576]  It doesn't exist.
[01:39:58.576 --> 01:40:02.978]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[01:40:02.978 --> 01:40:05.940]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:10.582]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[01:40:10.582 --> 01:40:12.703]  He's actually a performance artist.
[01:40:12.703 --> 01:40:14.344]  He's a performance artist.
[01:40:14.344 --> 01:40:15.505]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:40:16.172 --> 01:40:19.813]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:25.194]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[01:40:25.194 --> 01:40:32.456]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[01:40:32.456 --> 01:40:34.136]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[01:40:34.136 --> 01:40:34.836]  You'll die.
[01:40:34.836 --> 01:40:35.776]  It's fun.
[01:40:35.776 --> 01:40:37.457]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[01:40:38.557 --> 01:40:39.798]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence.
[01:40:39.798 --> 01:40:42.580]  They look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:48.844]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[01:40:48.844 --> 01:40:51.586]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[01:40:51.586 --> 01:40:53.007]  Hail Cobra!
[01:40:53.007 --> 01:40:53.928]  Or Optimus Prime.
[01:40:53.928 --> 01:40:56.189]  Autobots, let's roll!
[01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:59.251]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[01:40:59.251 --> 01:41:00.152]  Or Darth Vader.
[01:41:00.152 --> 01:41:03.254]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[01:41:03.254 --> 01:41:06.336]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:41:07.796 --> 01:41:09.377]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[01:41:09.377 --> 01:41:09.657]  No.
[01:41:09.657 --> 01:41:13.198]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, The Joker?
[01:41:13.198 --> 01:41:13.678]  No.
[01:41:13.678 --> 01:41:21.542]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.322]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[01:41:23.322 --> 01:41:26.304]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[01:41:26.304 --> 01:41:28.464]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[01:41:28.464 --> 01:41:30.205]  It's required by the CDC.
[01:41:30.205 --> 01:41:31.506]  But they play those games.
[01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:35.227]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[01:41:35.227 --> 01:41:44.029]  Even though I tell people, OK, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:46.369]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[01:41:46.369 --> 01:41:47.889]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:41:47.889 --> 01:41:50.190]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:53.051]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:54.691]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[01:41:54.691 --> 01:41:57.452]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[01:41:59.652 --> 01:42:08.139]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[01:42:08.139 --> 01:42:09.560]  And you know that!
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:10.721]  You're insulted right now.
[01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:12.282]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[01:42:12.282 --> 01:42:17.246]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[01:42:17.246 --> 01:42:21.610]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:22.691]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[01:42:24.019 --> 01:42:25.860]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:27.001]  He's smart.
[01:42:27.001 --> 01:42:28.362]  He's funny as hell.
[01:42:28.362 --> 01:42:29.403]  He's truly funny.
[01:42:29.403 --> 01:42:30.624]  I'm kind of retarded.
[01:42:39.031 --> 01:42:53.419]  Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com that has all the cited information?
[01:42:53.419 --> 01:42:56.581]  The latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[01:42:56.581 --> 01:42:58.842]  No, that's a real thing!
[01:42:58.842 --> 01:43:01.944]  That's something happening in the real world!
[01:43:01.944 --> 01:43:03.525]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[01:43:04.825 --> 01:43:08.826]  I am Alex Jones and I am the guy on this show every day.
[01:43:08.826 --> 01:43:21.549]  I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[01:43:21.549 --> 01:43:22.830]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:43:35.913 --> 01:43:40.155]  InfoWars has been banned.
[01:43:40.155 --> 01:43:44.077]  Arrested.
[01:43:44.077 --> 01:43:46.859]  Attacked and threatened.
[01:43:46.859 --> 01:43:50.180]  Because we are effective.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.001]  The Great Awakening is here.
[01:43:52.001 --> 01:43:54.303]  Go to Banned.Video.
[01:43:54.303 --> 01:43:58.405]  Download the videos and share.
[01:43:58.405 --> 01:44:02.087]  Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:44:05.729 --> 01:44:07.890]  And never give up the fight.
[01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:22.938]  InfoWars.com Well, Ye's got his mask.
[01:44:22.938 --> 01:44:25.339]  He's a superhero.
[01:44:25.339 --> 01:44:27.520]  I represent the bad guys.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.981]  David Icke's little reptoids.
[01:44:30.071 --> 01:44:33.573]  So, now your enemy's in here hosting the show with you, Yay.
[01:44:33.573 --> 01:44:37.676]  We got Nick Fuentes, one of my best buddies who works for us, does a really good job.
[01:44:37.676 --> 01:44:38.657]  He's over there with us.
[01:44:38.657 --> 01:44:40.858]  Oh, now he's turning to Alex Jones.
[01:44:40.858 --> 01:44:42.960]  So what are we gonna do here, Yay?
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.421]  The Balenciaga situation.
[01:44:44.421 --> 01:44:50.265]  You made a great point during a break earlier about how they just need a new devil, but that's a devil to distract us from the fact that we become the devil.
[01:44:50.265 --> 01:44:52.406]  That's kind of what you said, can you repeat that?
[01:44:52.406 --> 01:44:53.167]  Yeah, I just saw...
[01:44:54.269 --> 01:45:06.719]  People making videos about it and I said, it just seems like it's just more noise and mayhem and cold red and things to get people outraged.
[01:45:06.719 --> 01:45:16.807]  As I said before, every form of pornography is only 10 years away from pedophilia.
[01:45:16.807 --> 01:45:19.629]  Anybody that's watching pornography, if you're watching a woman,
[01:45:20.129 --> 01:45:21.390]  We're good to go.
[01:45:35.802 --> 01:45:44.265]  of experiencing pedophilia, but sex is a legal drug that's pushed to destroy humanity.
[01:45:44.265 --> 01:45:53.168]  If you drive down the street in California, they will be pushing strip clubs, they're pushing alcohol, they're pushing sex.
[01:45:53.168 --> 01:45:57.229]  So for people to have this moral code about
[01:45:58.132 --> 01:46:02.955]  Pedophilia, but no moral code about strip clubs, pornography, and the sex industry.
[01:46:02.955 --> 01:46:04.396]  It's not what the Bible says.
[01:46:04.396 --> 01:46:07.018]  The Bible says that all of that is wrong.
[01:46:07.018 --> 01:46:10.200]  So Jesus said so, or Jesus said no.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:11.561]  That's when we just need to follow.
[01:46:11.561 --> 01:46:12.281]  Let me ask you this.
[01:46:12.281 --> 01:46:13.642]  What about world population?
[01:46:13.642 --> 01:46:15.724]  The globalists say there's too many people.
[01:46:15.724 --> 01:46:16.684]  They want to sterilize us.
[01:46:16.684 --> 01:46:17.845]  They want to promote transgenderism.
[01:46:17.845 --> 01:46:19.626]  They want to depopulate us.
[01:46:19.626 --> 01:46:21.367]  Do you think that that's accurate?
[01:46:21.367 --> 01:46:23.949]  Or, I mean, what do you think of the New World Order and its overall agenda?
[01:46:24.309 --> 01:46:25.010]  I believe so.
[01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:27.111]  I'm more of a gut feeling person.
[01:46:27.111 --> 01:46:30.033]  Like I said, I'm the battering ram.
[01:46:30.033 --> 01:46:34.536]  And you guys are the SWAT team to come in afterwards and then give the information.
[01:46:34.536 --> 01:46:45.142]  God has people, different kind of warriors, different heights, different mindsets, different colors.
[01:46:45.142 --> 01:46:50.526]  And our collective agenda needs to be to serve God in what we do.
[01:46:50.526 --> 01:46:52.587]  And we can't do that if we don't have a hope and freedom act.
[01:46:54.528 --> 01:46:54.948]  What'd you say?
[01:46:54.948 --> 01:46:55.268]  I'm sorry.
[01:46:55.268 --> 01:46:57.029]  We can't do that if we don't have an open free debate.
[01:46:57.029 --> 01:46:57.850]  And that's what we have.
[01:46:57.850 --> 01:46:59.111]  God brought us here.
[01:46:59.111 --> 01:47:01.432]  You created this platform, the InfoWorth.
[01:47:01.432 --> 01:47:11.958]  I heard about the legend of Alex Jones from this lady named Tracy Romulus, Tracy Gwynne, who is faking like a Christian is really
[01:47:13.203 --> 01:47:14.023]  You know what?
[01:47:14.023 --> 01:47:18.706]  Much love to Tracy Romulus and Tracy Gwynne, because this is the type of person I will sue.
[01:47:18.706 --> 01:47:22.688]  I'm just gonna say, I prefer that person not be next to my children.
[01:47:22.688 --> 01:47:26.009]  So, much love, and Jesus, God bless your family.
[01:47:26.009 --> 01:47:29.891]  I would prefer that that person be not next to my children.
[01:47:29.891 --> 01:47:31.432]  Next person, next subject.
[01:47:31.432 --> 01:47:36.994]  Balenciaga, though, you were gonna, I mean, just overall, what are you, because obviously you work with a lot of fashion brands, and now all this stuff's come out.
[01:47:36.994 --> 01:47:39.576]  It's almost like they did this on purpose as a PR stunt.
[01:47:40.450 --> 01:47:41.190]  I think so.
[01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:49.414]  You know, I'm friends with the head designer, and I believe that it was a setup.
[01:47:49.414 --> 01:47:51.095]  I think it was a hit job.
[01:47:51.095 --> 01:47:59.159]  And now, all of a sudden, everyone is so outraged and focused on Balenciaga, but then we're still aborting our kids.
[01:47:59.159 --> 01:48:00.940]  We're still fornicating.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:04.241]  We're still killing each other.
[01:48:04.241 --> 01:48:07.163]  We're still listening to music that promotes that.
[01:48:07.163 --> 01:48:09.564]  But, oh, we don't wear Balenciaga now.
[01:48:10.924 --> 01:48:12.145]  Shut the hell up!
[01:48:12.145 --> 01:48:12.746]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:48:12.746 --> 01:48:14.948]  At the end of the day, what are you doing?
[01:48:14.948 --> 01:48:16.229]  You're throwing stones.
[01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:18.911]  Oh my God, but you know our moral code.
[01:48:18.911 --> 01:48:21.533]  We just, we just cheated on our wives.
[01:48:21.533 --> 01:48:23.574]  We just, we just fornicated.
[01:48:23.574 --> 01:48:25.276]  We just had threesomes.
[01:48:25.276 --> 01:48:27.598]  We just bought some sex on Instagram.
[01:48:27.598 --> 01:48:28.899]  We just sold some sex.
[01:48:28.899 --> 01:48:32.221]  We use sex to sell a product, but we don't like Balenciaga.
[01:48:32.221 --> 01:48:32.822]  Shut up!
[01:48:33.562 --> 01:48:34.323]  Shut up!
[01:48:34.323 --> 01:48:36.425]  I'm throwing the tablets right now.
[01:48:36.425 --> 01:48:37.005]  Shut up!
[01:48:37.005 --> 01:48:44.111]  Instagram is about prostitution, and everyone involved in any version of the sex business is as bad as the pedophiles.
[01:48:44.111 --> 01:48:46.133]  So everyone, shut up!
[01:48:46.133 --> 01:48:46.293]  Yeah.
[01:48:47.495 --> 01:48:48.096]  I'm listening.
[01:48:48.096 --> 01:48:48.977]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.977 --> 01:48:55.424]  So think of all the thousands of topics we can cover in the limited time we have as you're about to get on a plane and go back to another state and do some new stuff.
[01:48:55.424 --> 01:48:56.705]  What else is on your radar?
[01:48:56.705 --> 01:48:57.566]  Because there's a lot.
[01:48:57.566 --> 01:48:59.048]  What do you think about the Ukraine war?
[01:48:59.048 --> 01:49:00.870]  What do you think about the devaluation of the dollar?
[01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:02.592]  What do you think about FTX and Bitcoin?
[01:49:02.592 --> 01:49:03.453]  There's so many topics.
[01:49:06.195 --> 01:49:11.237]  Well, yeah, in terms of Ukraine and Russia, I haven't really seen so much of that in the news.
[01:49:11.237 --> 01:49:12.678]  I'm, of course, pro-Putin.
[01:49:12.678 --> 01:49:14.939]  I'm very pro-Russia.
[01:49:14.939 --> 01:49:15.940]  I am also.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:18.101]  Let's go, yeah.
[01:49:18.101 --> 01:49:24.083]  You know, you see that this is just an extension of the United States' neocon establishment, New World Order-type stuff.
[01:49:24.083 --> 01:49:27.305]  What does Putin say about America's value system?
[01:49:27.865 --> 01:49:40.974]  So, he said in his speech when he annexed those two breakaway provinces and he annexed the Donbass, he said in his speech that we have totally abandoned traditional values, traditional faith, and that we've actually embraced full-on Satanism.
[01:49:40.974 --> 01:49:41.814]  And he's totally right.
[01:49:41.814 --> 01:49:43.015]  Well, it's true.
[01:49:43.015 --> 01:49:44.496]  America's embracing Satanism.
[01:49:44.496 --> 01:49:46.598]  But Jesus is alive.
[01:49:47.566 --> 01:49:49.769]  And these things are going to pull.
[01:49:49.769 --> 01:49:51.871]  It's a movement.
[01:49:51.871 --> 01:49:54.594]  God, the devil is a defeated foe.
[01:49:54.594 --> 01:49:57.517]  We're not even going to speak any of that into existence.
[01:49:57.517 --> 01:50:05.265]  God runs the world and it's freedom fighters for Christ like us today that are going to stop it right now and say, we got to start here.
[01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:07.167]  Each one of us, we are the church.
[01:50:08.106 --> 01:50:10.087]  We are the priests of our homes.
[01:50:10.087 --> 01:50:14.450]  All the men's are the priests of their homes and everyone is the body of Christ and we start here.
[01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:34.064]  Sin, it's like we're a glass of water and sin is like throwing acid and used plastic and stepped on bugs in a glass and then you want to pour some water in and it tastes bad so what you want to cover it with an alcohol flavor or with some food coloring or with a sexy outfit or something and then you want to just keep on drinking that sin and
[01:50:34.404 --> 01:50:34.644]  Thank you.
[01:50:54.304 --> 01:51:05.832]  The newer version, the amended Constitution that me and Nick are rewriting and working on right now, and the ideas of purifying our system because we need will and expertise.
[01:51:05.832 --> 01:51:06.573]  Well, let's talk about that.
[01:51:06.573 --> 01:51:08.694]  You say you're going to run for president in 2024.
[01:51:08.694 --> 01:51:13.297]  I'm not, Alex, you're really good at stating things in a way that you get you sued.
[01:51:13.297 --> 01:51:14.238]  So.
[01:51:14.238 --> 01:51:16.399]  No, I thought you're announcing for president, right?
[01:51:16.399 --> 01:51:19.281]  No, I'm not announcing.
[01:51:19.281 --> 01:51:19.462]  Alex.
[01:51:20.322 --> 01:51:21.923]  Love you, love you, love you.
[01:51:21.923 --> 01:51:33.391]  What I'm saying with the conversation that we're having about a possible 2024 walk and a victory at the office.
[01:51:33.391 --> 01:51:42.758]  America, I'm putting everything on the line for the truth to bring you a cleaner system.
[01:51:42.758 --> 01:51:46.501]  Our system has been dirtied and muddied and destroyed.
[01:51:47.299 --> 01:51:56.636]  I am not the oldest, I am not the most knowledgeable Christian, and I'm not the most knowledgeable politician, but I am truthful.
[01:51:56.636 --> 01:51:59.941]  I'm nobody's hard- No, no, I believe that what I was trying to get to is what is your platform?
[01:52:00.970 --> 01:52:03.451]  And you text me your platform, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:52:03.451 --> 01:52:09.533]  Well, it starts here with the Bible, and we're going to work through this with our designers.
[01:52:09.533 --> 01:52:14.795]  We're going to approach America like Steve Jobs approached Apple.
[01:52:14.795 --> 01:52:22.298]  We are the youngest startup in history, but we're the world power because of our military, and mainly because of our naval force.
[01:52:22.298 --> 01:52:26.700]  And it shows how smart and how powerful Americans are.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:29.521]  The engineering, the sheer engineering, we invented Apple,
[01:52:30.041 --> 01:52:39.804]  We have the strongest military, and now we have to take that same type of sensibility, take it out of Wall Street's hands, and give it to the people.
[01:52:39.804 --> 01:52:47.087]  That engineering mind that created the trams, that made Disney, that made Pixar, that made Lucasfilms, that made Apple.
[01:52:47.087 --> 01:52:57.430]  That engineering mind, these minds that we have, are going to be brought together to cure America, and then we will influence the rest of the world into
[01:52:58.190 --> 01:53:18.700]  Higher consciousness and into peace and I agree we were given that birthright and somehow it's been lost I'm gonna talk about that and after you leave soon We're gonna have Owen and everybody else myself stay here and continue on and take calls as long as you can stay and I gotta go soon But I wanted to bring in Owen Schroeder and Ali Alexander who helped get you here for their take and any questions They've got for yay because you guys have great questions great comments.
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.241]  So Owen Schroeder and Ali Alexander
[01:53:22.381 --> 01:53:33.006]  I'll hold my questions for Ye later, because I kind of want to come in, because we have a lot of eyes on this transmission right now, and there's a lot of people sharing their opinions on the internet with this right now.
[01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:43.131]  And so I kind of just want to, you know, I just want to take a step back and just say, look, we're in a difficult realm with what we're doing here today, trying to balance fun and seriousness, because we are serious people.
[01:53:43.131 --> 01:53:45.852]  We have serious missions and goals, but we also want to have fun.
[01:53:45.852 --> 01:53:46.713]  We don't want to hate life.
[01:53:46.713 --> 01:53:49.014]  We want to enjoy life, and we want other people to enjoy life.
[01:53:49.574 --> 01:53:56.698]  And when I see the response on the internet from the haters and the people getting angry today, I'm just a little perturbed.
[01:53:56.698 --> 01:53:58.339]  Let Ye speak!
[01:53:58.339 --> 01:53:59.360]  Let the man speak!
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:03.062]  You may not agree with what he has to say, but why don't you want him to speak?
[01:54:03.062 --> 01:54:03.802]  I don't get it.
[01:54:03.802 --> 01:54:05.183]  Same thing with Alex Jones.
[01:54:05.183 --> 01:54:07.164]  Why don't you want Alex to speak?
[01:54:07.164 --> 01:54:08.905]  What is wrong with you?
[01:54:08.905 --> 01:54:09.745]  Why are you so angry?
[01:54:09.745 --> 01:54:11.486]  Why are you so serious all the time?
[01:54:11.486 --> 01:54:13.327]  If you don't like what they say, tune it out.
[01:54:13.327 --> 01:54:14.508]  But here's what gets me, Alex.
[01:54:14.508 --> 01:54:15.068]  This is what bothers me.
[01:54:16.369 --> 01:54:18.992]  It's bothered me with the attacks on you over the years.
[01:54:18.992 --> 01:54:21.715]  It bothers me with the attacks we see on Ye today.
[01:54:21.715 --> 01:54:27.522]  Whether you agree with everything he said or disagree with everything he said, let's get our priorities straight here, okay?
[01:54:27.522 --> 01:54:31.646]  If you're upset with what Kanye West has said today, let me remind you that Kanye West...
[01:54:33.328 --> 01:54:34.989]  Let me correct that.
[01:54:34.989 --> 01:54:35.570]  Yay.
[01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:43.295]  If you're upset with anything Yay has said here today, Yay is not the person in Chicago shooting people every night, teenagers, innocent people dying.
[01:54:43.295 --> 01:54:45.376]  Yay is not the person in D.C.
[01:54:45.376 --> 01:54:48.218]  in Congress selling this country out for decades.
[01:54:48.218 --> 01:54:53.982]  Yay is not the person with big pharma that's killed millions of people with their products.
[01:54:53.982 --> 01:54:59.225]  It's all come out in court that still has influence to mandate their products on the people.
[01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.666]  That's not Yay.
[01:55:00.666 --> 01:55:03.188]  Yay is not the one that's lying to us
[01:55:03.288 --> 01:55:04.169]  That's right.
[01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:25.792]  And I don't even think you have the capability to enjoy life anymore.
[01:55:25.792 --> 01:55:28.213]  And you need to take a serious look and reflection in the mirror.
[01:55:28.213 --> 01:55:29.313]  Well, they're against free will.
[01:55:29.313 --> 01:55:32.055]  They're against free open discussion, which shows they're evil.
[01:55:32.055 --> 01:55:36.417]  And anyone going along with censoring somebody's speech is a fraud and enemy of the people.
[01:55:36.417 --> 01:55:45.861]  But we are, the people are not evil, it's Satan that controls the people and puts demonic blocks so when you see the truth in front of you, you can't even hold the truth.
[01:55:46.321 --> 01:55:47.603]  Like, it's demonic blocks.
[01:55:47.603 --> 01:55:51.968]  I can go to Kim and say, hey, put your family first.
[01:55:51.968 --> 01:55:53.831]  You have someone who loves you.
[01:55:53.831 --> 01:55:54.672]  Put us first.
[01:55:54.672 --> 01:55:55.993]  Put your children's first.
[01:55:55.993 --> 01:55:59.938]  And it's demonic blocks bringing her into traumatic
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.601]  You know, everything.
[01:56:02.601 --> 01:56:03.941]  She was pushing to the sex tape.
[01:56:03.941 --> 01:56:09.223]  She's pushing to saying that she had sex with Pete Davidson in front of a fireplace.
[01:56:09.223 --> 01:56:11.204]  Hulu does not love you, Kim.
[01:56:11.204 --> 01:56:12.764]  Disney does not love you, Kim.
[01:56:12.764 --> 01:56:13.765]  Come home, Kim.
[01:56:13.765 --> 01:56:15.085]  Come home to Christ.
[01:56:15.085 --> 01:56:15.805]  Go to God.
[01:56:15.805 --> 01:56:16.586]  Go to Jesus.
[01:56:16.586 --> 01:56:20.567]  Because you saying you might not ever or marry somebody great.
[01:56:20.567 --> 01:56:23.088]  Go, go marry Tom Brady, whatever you want to do.
[01:56:23.088 --> 01:56:25.249]  But get married and use your platform
[01:56:25.689 --> 01:56:25.949]  I think?
[01:56:45.203 --> 01:56:47.604]  Making people mad, outraged, going out on the street.
[01:56:47.604 --> 01:56:48.625]  We're so outraged.
[01:56:48.625 --> 01:56:53.027]  But you're not doing anything yourself to change it and follow God and follow Christ.
[01:56:53.027 --> 01:56:56.108]  We haven't said anything against the Word of God today.
[01:56:56.108 --> 01:56:57.869]  God says, love everyone.
[01:56:57.869 --> 01:57:04.913]  So if I say, I love the Zionists that cancelled my account, then I can say, I love, I did not consent.
[01:57:04.913 --> 01:57:06.233]  I do love Hitler.
[01:57:06.233 --> 01:57:07.374]  I do love the Zionists.
[01:57:07.674 --> 01:57:09.275]  I love everyone.
[01:57:09.275 --> 01:57:12.658]  The Zionist cannot tell me who I can love and not love.
[01:57:12.658 --> 01:57:13.938]  I don't think like that.
[01:57:13.938 --> 01:57:16.820]  I think more like someone that's on the spectrum.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:21.003]  Since that's what they want to claim, well let me be on the spectrum of love because love is the answer.
[01:57:21.003 --> 01:57:22.084]  But that's a good t-shirt.
[01:57:22.084 --> 01:57:23.325]  I love Hitler.
[01:57:23.325 --> 01:57:24.005]  That's a bar.
[01:57:24.005 --> 01:57:24.466]  I'm joking.
[01:57:26.767 --> 01:57:29.428]  I love Zionists too.
[01:57:29.428 --> 01:57:30.628]  I love Zionists.
[01:57:30.628 --> 01:57:31.448]  We love everyone.
[01:57:31.448 --> 01:57:34.229]  You're just saying love humanity and stop getting past the labels.
[01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:35.129]  Love is the key.
[01:57:35.129 --> 01:57:39.450]  Everyone's promoting this loathing and it's time to promote love.
[01:57:39.450 --> 01:57:39.790]  God.
[01:57:39.790 --> 01:57:40.230]  No, I hear you.
[01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.210]  Let's bring in Ali Alexander who helped get this done.
[01:57:42.210 --> 01:57:44.771]  Ali, I've known you for years, but this is quite the broadcast.
[01:57:44.771 --> 01:57:48.071]  This is definitely, so far in 2022, the biggest broadcast of the year.
[01:57:48.071 --> 01:57:49.172]  This is it.
[01:57:49.172 --> 01:57:50.892]  Yeah, don't put this on me, Ricky Bobby.
[01:57:52.875 --> 01:57:53.635]  That's right.
[01:57:53.635 --> 01:57:55.016]  You're not first, you're last.
[01:57:55.016 --> 01:57:56.557]  Come on, Ali, you're on air.
[01:57:56.557 --> 01:57:57.397]  Give us your take on this.
[01:57:57.397 --> 01:57:58.878]  No, no, I mean, this is great.
[01:57:58.878 --> 01:58:04.141]  Look, I love everybody on screen and I love them and I like them and I frankly, I endorse them.
[01:58:04.141 --> 01:58:06.422]  And I think that what Owen said is absolutely right.
[01:58:06.422 --> 01:58:09.864]  It's like you can look at this interview and you can be triggered.
[01:58:09.864 --> 01:58:12.325]  You know, you can engage your ego and say,
[01:58:13.705 --> 01:58:16.866]  Ye endorsed genocide when he didn't.
[01:58:16.866 --> 01:58:27.569]  You can look at this broadcast and say Nicholas French is a 23, 24 year old, you know, secret dog whistling KKK Nazi, but that's also not the case.
[01:58:27.569 --> 01:58:33.411]  You could say that Alex Jones and Orrin Schroer are actually platforming hate, but that's not what's going on at all.
[01:58:33.411 --> 01:58:40.073]  And I think what's powerful about this broadcast, I really think that we're making narrative history, is that we're breaking the Overton window.
[01:58:40.453 --> 01:58:43.075]  The Republican establishment sold us out.
[01:58:43.075 --> 01:58:45.457]  The conservative movement sold us out.
[01:58:45.457 --> 01:58:47.519]  The churches, they closed.
[01:58:47.519 --> 01:58:50.682]  So when we look for leadership on the right, there was none.
[01:58:50.682 --> 01:58:51.122]  Okay?
[01:58:51.122 --> 01:58:57.128]  When Owen Schroyer got charged, when Ollie Alexander got sued and investigated, Alex, when you got sued,
[01:58:57.628 --> 01:59:04.069]  Did we get a call from Mar-a-Lago saying, hey, I'm a billionaire and I want to help fund what you guys have been through for me?
[01:59:04.069 --> 01:59:04.930]  No, we didn't.
[01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:15.612]  So here we are left with the last option on InfoWars, the home of the resistance, and we're a bunch of pseudo-celebrities with one celebrity saying, OK, well, then we're just going to break the chessboard.
[01:59:15.612 --> 01:59:18.152]  We're getting off your chessboard because it is rigged.
[01:59:18.152 --> 01:59:19.613]  It's rigged by Lucifer.
[01:59:19.613 --> 01:59:20.693]  It's rigged by the Satanists.
[01:59:21.413 --> 01:59:24.955]  It is rigged by the Jewish Mafia, and people don't want to say that.
[01:59:24.955 --> 01:59:28.557]  It's rigged by the Marxists, and the leftists, and all of these people.
[01:59:28.557 --> 01:59:34.341]  And it's actually, frankly, rigged by people who would, you know, betray Christ within the church, the apostates.
[01:59:34.341 --> 01:59:37.783]  So, I think that this broadcast should encourage everybody to
[01:59:38.263 --> 01:59:40.444]  Take everyone else just at their word.
[01:59:40.444 --> 01:59:41.925]  Only use what they're saying.
[01:59:41.925 --> 01:59:44.286]  Take it in good faith and in the best light.
[01:59:44.286 --> 01:59:48.268]  And stop relying on the ADL and the SPLC or Twitter trends.
[01:59:48.268 --> 01:59:50.549]  In fact, Elon should get rid of Twitter trends.
[01:59:50.549 --> 01:59:53.010]  There shouldn't be editorial little comments.
[01:59:53.010 --> 01:59:54.190]  Well, they always control it anyway.
[01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:55.371]  We hit number one, they took it off.
[01:59:55.371 --> 01:59:59.232]  But bigger than that, what about the biomedical mafia?
[01:59:59.232 --> 02:00:00.093]  The big pharma?
[02:00:00.093 --> 02:00:02.154]  It's the King Daddy with the central banks.
[02:00:02.694 --> 02:00:08.553]  Yes, my only concern about certain other elites, how about the big corporate elite that all links up with one agenda, yeah?
[02:00:10.183 --> 02:00:12.145]  Jesus runs the world.
[02:00:12.145 --> 02:00:22.436]  Elon needs to put Alex Jones back on the platform because I don't agree with someone that doesn't believe in Christ saying, you're cool, you're cool, you're cool, not you.
[02:00:22.436 --> 02:00:23.857]  And this is my friend, right?
[02:00:23.857 --> 02:00:26.520]  This is my boy, but we can agree to disagree, right?
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.721]  But it's still his platform.
[02:00:27.721 --> 02:00:28.282]  It's up to him.
[02:00:28.282 --> 02:00:31.885]  But also, I'm not a person that's going to say, hey, I agree with everything.
[02:00:31.885 --> 02:00:33.167]  There's things that I said today
[02:00:33.587 --> 02:00:39.231]  That you guys don't agree with because you're not in the same place or in the same position in your walk that I'm at.
[02:00:39.231 --> 02:00:46.095]  I'm in a position where I love the person who, the doctor that had plastic surgery on my mom.
[02:00:46.095 --> 02:00:49.617]  I always have been in a way where it's, I can't hate.
[02:00:49.617 --> 02:00:51.378]  You said your mother was sacrificed.
[02:00:51.378 --> 02:00:52.699]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:00:52.699 --> 02:00:55.361]  Yeah, I believe that Michael Jordan's dad was sacrificed.
[02:00:56.101 --> 02:00:57.222]  I believe.
[02:00:57.222 --> 02:00:58.824]  Didn't something happen with Tiger Woods?
[02:00:58.824 --> 02:00:59.885]  Yeah.
[02:00:59.885 --> 02:01:00.665]  My mom.
[02:01:00.665 --> 02:01:04.569]  These are all Zionist sacrifices that happened.
[02:01:04.569 --> 02:01:06.410]  But this is Satan at the end of the day.
[02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:10.534]  There's a lot of people that feel like we're at the end of days.
[02:01:10.534 --> 02:01:12.496]  And Jesus runs the world.
[02:01:12.496 --> 02:01:13.297]  God runs the world.
[02:01:13.297 --> 02:01:14.678]  Jesus is the real King of Israel.
[02:01:16.119 --> 02:01:20.240]  And I'm just a simple servant of God.
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:22.361]  I'm not a mathematician.
[02:01:22.361 --> 02:01:23.261]  I hear you.
[02:01:23.261 --> 02:01:25.381]  You said white lives matter.
[02:01:25.381 --> 02:01:27.082]  I'm not going to put words in your mouth.
[02:01:27.082 --> 02:01:31.363]  You understood that they're trying to demonize white people to create a crisis and for us to fight with each other.
[02:01:31.363 --> 02:01:32.043]  I thought that was very true.
[02:01:32.043 --> 02:01:33.323]  I think all lives matter.
[02:01:33.323 --> 02:01:35.023]  But you went even stronger and said white lives matter.
[02:01:35.023 --> 02:01:36.184]  You got criticized for that.
[02:01:36.184 --> 02:01:36.964]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:01:38.012 --> 02:01:41.513]  Yeah, I thought that that was my right.
[02:01:41.513 --> 02:01:48.335]  I just exercise rights that are only given to whites.
[02:01:48.335 --> 02:01:57.558]  A white person can wear a t-shirt that says Black Lives Matter, but for a black person to wear a t-shirt that says White Lives Matter, that somehow makes me racist.
[02:01:57.558 --> 02:02:01.479]  So I love just going up and saying, hey, what do you think about this?
[02:02:01.479 --> 02:02:02.820]  What about that?
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.140]  And if we don't
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:07.262]  Use if we don't use our consciousness.
[02:02:07.262 --> 02:02:24.796]  They're trying to beat us into our consciousness and make us ignorant They want to dumb us down and I'm probably the lowest IQ here of anyone speaking and I'm saying Say out loud what we feel we would no longer be ran by the idea of fake influence and celebrities.
[02:02:24.796 --> 02:02:27.478]  I did I'm gonna interrupt you Hold on Alex.
[02:02:27.478 --> 02:02:28.358]  Don't interrupt me.
[02:02:28.358 --> 02:02:31.361]  I didn't know I denounce every celebrity
[02:02:31.841 --> 02:02:36.405]  I denounce every celebrity I ever stood next to, God bless you.
[02:02:36.405 --> 02:02:39.268]  And you know it's the Christian word of what I really want to say.
[02:02:39.268 --> 02:02:44.292]  Any celebrity, only celebrity that I rock with is Ray J. Literally.
[02:02:44.292 --> 02:02:49.297]  Every one of y'all others y'all all saw, come see me when y'all want to see me.
[02:02:49.757 --> 02:03:00.426]  Every fake, gangster, so-called killer, any basketball player, any rapper, any actress, any musician, any model, any editor, come see me!
[02:03:00.426 --> 02:03:03.028]  Come see God's child right now!
[02:03:03.028 --> 02:03:04.009]  Please!
[02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:05.430]  I want it!
[02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:07.171]  I want to see my mama!
[02:03:07.171 --> 02:03:08.552]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:03:08.552 --> 02:03:11.295]  You can't touch in Jesus' name, baby!
[02:03:11.295 --> 02:03:13.637]  I was going to say this, though.
[02:03:13.637 --> 02:03:14.838]  I want to be clear.
[02:03:16.278 --> 02:03:17.940]  You say you have the lowest IQ of anybody here.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:19.301]  I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:03:19.301 --> 02:03:20.603]  Yeah, that's not true.
[02:03:20.603 --> 02:03:21.864]  There's different types.
[02:03:21.864 --> 02:03:22.945]  IQ is just one test.
[02:03:22.945 --> 02:03:23.886]  It's one thing.
[02:03:23.886 --> 02:03:25.948]  There's cultural IQ.
[02:03:25.948 --> 02:03:26.989]  There's mathematical.
[02:03:26.989 --> 02:03:27.810]  There's spiritual.
[02:03:27.810 --> 02:03:30.432]  There's economic savant.
[02:03:30.432 --> 02:03:32.034]  There's art savant.
[02:03:32.034 --> 02:03:34.517]  And I can tell you I'm an idiot savant.
[02:03:35.477 --> 02:03:36.217]  That's a French word.
[02:03:36.217 --> 02:03:37.698]  It doesn't mean I'm actually an idiot.
[02:03:37.698 --> 02:03:40.379]  It means that I don't know a lot of stuff, but things I know, I know.
[02:03:40.379 --> 02:03:43.640]  I don't want to get into it, folks, but it's ridiculous.
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:47.582]  I can wake up at 2 a.m., 5 a.m.
[02:03:47.582 --> 02:03:49.642]  I can tell you what time the clock's going to say before I look at it.
[02:03:49.642 --> 02:03:51.103]  There's a little weird thing I can do.
[02:03:51.103 --> 02:03:56.045]  The point is that there's savants that actually bring the world to the next level.
[02:03:57.998 --> 02:03:59.400]  People need to take that for what it is.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.488]  I wouldn't call you autistic, but you have a savantish thing about you.
[02:04:04.488 --> 02:04:06.190]  And I think that's a positive, not a negative.
[02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:07.913]  Nick, you want to say anything?
[02:04:07.913 --> 02:04:09.736]  You want to say anything, Ollie or Owen?
[02:04:09.736 --> 02:04:10.156]  And Fabio.
[02:04:11.825 --> 02:04:15.849]  Yeah, I want to say this, you know, this is a story that Yeh shared.
[02:04:15.849 --> 02:04:19.632]  I'm not even going to ask permission because he said he's nobody's hard drive, so I'm nobody's hard drive.
[02:04:19.632 --> 02:04:28.780]  You know, Yeh was hanging out with Elon and Elon was sitting there and they were under a rocket launch and Elon says to Yeh, you know, you have the highest EQ.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.562]  So there's also the EQ.
[02:04:30.562 --> 02:04:35.146]  And what I think Yeh is talking about is like, we've assembled a powerful group of Avengers
[02:04:35.606 --> 02:04:39.251]  We have different experiences, different expertise.
[02:04:39.251 --> 02:04:42.755]  We, in fact, even interpret information differently.
[02:04:42.755 --> 02:04:53.028]  But we've all got a superpower and we've got to contribute it to taking down the permastate, the deep state, the globalists, whatever anybody wants to call this, you know, this group that's running us, this depopulation group.
[02:04:53.668 --> 02:04:56.490]  Uh, we've gotta, you know, rage war against the machine.
[02:04:56.490 --> 02:05:00.353]  If everybody rushes to get canceled, they can cancel none of us.
[02:05:00.353 --> 02:05:04.916]  And so I think that today, again, is a historic day in which it's not about agreement.
[02:05:04.916 --> 02:05:08.138]  It's an agreement and disagreement against them.
[02:05:08.138 --> 02:05:12.200]  No, I agree that this is about saying free speech is sacrosanct.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:15.663]  And even if you disagree with something, it should be celebrated instead of demonizing it.
[02:05:16.263 --> 02:05:16.725]  Wait, wait, wait.
[02:05:16.725 --> 02:05:17.487]  Let me interrupt here.
[02:05:17.487 --> 02:05:20.817]  And Nick is actually the person who's talked best about this.
[02:05:20.817 --> 02:05:23.285]  And this is where I think that, like, Laura Loomer...
[02:05:24.522 --> 02:05:37.533]  Who is a Zionist, Jew, conservative, and patriot, and then you, who are kind of libertarian or conservatarian, and Owen's kind of conservatarian, would disagree with Nick and I, who, you know, might be more of the Catholic tradition.
[02:05:37.533 --> 02:05:39.935]  We would totally support blasphemy laws.
[02:05:39.935 --> 02:05:40.615]  Totally.
[02:05:40.615 --> 02:05:45.679]  You know, and I don't want to speak for him, but, you know, what Nick points out is that you have to have a right to dissent.
[02:05:45.679 --> 02:05:53.626]  That is way more powerful than, you know, mood-free speech, where we're actually rigging the system to have what, yeah, he's talking about Instagram and
[02:05:53.926 --> 02:05:54.426]  Absolutely, Ali.
[02:05:54.426 --> 02:05:55.647]  We're going to come right back to you in a moment.
[02:05:55.647 --> 02:05:59.749]  Ye wants me to tweet on his giant, what, 35 million viewers?
[02:05:59.749 --> 02:06:00.209]  36 million?
[02:06:00.209 --> 02:06:03.690]  Yeah, we're going to have Alex Jones put up for my Twitter.
[02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:04.911]  Hi, Ari Emmanuel.
[02:06:04.911 --> 02:06:05.831]  How's it going?
[02:06:05.831 --> 02:06:07.952]  How's your wife's clothing line?
[02:06:07.952 --> 02:06:10.973]  Hey, let's do an overhead shot here, please, guys, so I can do this.
[02:06:10.973 --> 02:06:11.914]  I haven't tweeted in so long.
[02:06:11.914 --> 02:06:12.894]  I hardly remember how this works.
[02:06:12.894 --> 02:06:15.515]  Can you guys do an overhead shot for me?
[02:06:15.515 --> 02:06:19.777]  All right, so this is Ye's phone here, and I just want to say, I love
[02:06:24.016 --> 02:06:24.757]  Love.
[02:06:24.757 --> 02:06:25.337]  L-O-V-E.
[02:06:25.337 --> 02:06:26.017]  The.
[02:06:26.017 --> 02:06:27.919]  Jews.
[02:06:27.919 --> 02:06:29.200]  Glad you would say that.
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:29.580]  It's true.
[02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:31.361]  I do love them.
[02:06:31.361 --> 02:06:32.842]  First.
[02:06:32.842 --> 02:06:33.623]  How do you say amendment?
[02:06:33.623 --> 02:06:35.024]  A-M-T?
[02:06:35.024 --> 02:06:37.766]  What's the abbreviation?
[02:06:37.766 --> 02:06:38.947]  A-M-D-T, I think?
[02:06:38.947 --> 02:06:39.327]  Not sure.
[02:06:39.327 --> 02:06:40.748]  Yeah, I got it.
[02:06:40.748 --> 02:06:43.149]  I love the First Amendment.
[02:06:43.149 --> 02:06:46.332]  Long.
[02:06:46.332 --> 02:06:48.994]  Live.
[02:06:48.994 --> 02:06:49.614]  Yay.
[02:06:49.614 --> 02:06:50.915]  We've got to capitalize that, though.
[02:06:52.888 --> 02:06:54.470]  All right, I'm gonna tweet that.
[02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:56.031]  I love the First Amendment.
[02:06:56.031 --> 02:06:56.952]  Long live yay.
[02:06:56.952 --> 02:07:00.736]  I hope... No, no, no, no, we're gonna pray.
[02:07:00.736 --> 02:07:01.316]  No hoping.
[02:07:01.316 --> 02:07:02.477]  We pray.
[02:07:02.477 --> 02:07:05.921]  I pray... Pray Elon...
[02:07:10.367 --> 02:07:14.668]  Elon is for real.
[02:07:14.668 --> 02:07:16.768]  No, pray to God, not to Elon.
[02:07:16.768 --> 02:07:19.289]  Pray that God... I pray to God, I agree.
[02:07:19.289 --> 02:07:20.229]  I'll say that.
[02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:22.950]  I pray... To Jesus Christ.
[02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:23.730]  Jesus Christ.
[02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:24.450]  Say his name.
[02:07:24.450 --> 02:07:31.832]  There's power, there's strength in the name.
[02:07:31.832 --> 02:07:32.712]  Jesus.
[02:07:32.712 --> 02:07:36.673]  Okay, I pray to Jesus that Elon is for real.
[02:07:37.281 --> 02:07:38.542]  What do you mean by for real?
[02:07:38.542 --> 02:07:38.963]  What does that mean?
[02:07:38.963 --> 02:07:39.744]  For real about what?
[02:07:39.744 --> 02:07:40.124]  Be more specific.
[02:07:40.124 --> 02:07:42.727]  Trying to free up the Internet.
[02:07:42.727 --> 02:07:43.748]  Write that.
[02:07:43.748 --> 02:07:46.471]  I believe he is.
[02:07:46.471 --> 02:07:51.376]  That Apple doesn't de-platform Elon for freeing the Internet.
[02:07:51.376 --> 02:07:52.317]  I hope he's for real.
[02:07:52.317 --> 02:07:52.998]  No.
[02:07:52.998 --> 02:07:57.363]  Pray that Apple doesn't de-platform Elon for freeing the Internet.
[02:07:57.363 --> 02:07:58.023]  He just met with him.
[02:07:58.023 --> 02:07:59.305]  He says he's not now, but I hear you.
[02:08:01.380 --> 02:08:03.281]  And then dot, dot, dot.
[02:08:03.281 --> 02:08:04.402]  I love the First Amendment.
[02:08:04.402 --> 02:08:05.923]  Long live ye.
[02:08:05.923 --> 02:08:08.465]  I pray to Jesus that Elon is for real.
[02:08:08.465 --> 02:08:09.006]  Bam!
[02:08:09.006 --> 02:08:10.126]  I'm back on Twitter!
[02:08:10.126 --> 02:08:12.828]  There you go!
[02:08:12.828 --> 02:08:13.629]  Give it to him now.
[02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:15.510]  Here you go, buddy.
[02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:17.412]  35 million or whatever it is followers.
[02:08:17.412 --> 02:08:19.774]  This is great ideas you're having, man.
[02:08:19.774 --> 02:08:21.235]  I have a few good ideas.
[02:08:22.476 --> 02:08:22.896]  I believe.
[02:08:22.896 --> 02:08:23.657]  Let me talk for a second.
[02:08:23.657 --> 02:08:24.657]  Don't cut me off.
[02:08:24.657 --> 02:08:25.778]  I have a few good ideas.
[02:08:25.778 --> 02:08:34.162]  I have ideas that surpass the idea of just being a black face for the Trump administration.
[02:08:34.162 --> 02:08:37.603]  Just being Elon's cool friend at a concert.
[02:08:37.603 --> 02:08:40.485]  I actually have real ideas, Tim Cook.
[02:08:40.485 --> 02:08:42.466]  I actually have real ideas.
[02:08:42.466 --> 02:08:45.447]  And I get marginalized into these places.
[02:08:45.447 --> 02:08:46.187]  And I understand.
[02:08:46.187 --> 02:08:47.428]  People are afraid of the truth.
[02:08:48.163 --> 02:08:50.604]  The best EQ on the planet.
[02:08:50.604 --> 02:09:00.186]  When I went to people like David Simon and Jamie Salter and all these Jewish businessmen, they would offer me things like, hey, we'll give you one store.
[02:09:00.186 --> 02:09:01.706]  And I got frustrated.
[02:09:01.706 --> 02:09:11.808]  I got frustrated with the gap with Adidas of being held back and people act like they're going to help you, but they really control you like how Jamie Salter controls Shaquille O'Neal or the NBA
[02:09:12.348 --> 02:09:13.349]  Control Shaquille O'Neal.
[02:09:13.349 --> 02:09:15.932]  And this is nothing, no knock to our brother.
[02:09:15.932 --> 02:09:19.375]  All black people feel the way I feel, but nobody wants to go broke.
[02:09:19.375 --> 02:09:24.280]  No one else can take a $2 billion hit and still have $400 million, you know?
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:29.145]  So that's God putting me in a position to be able to fight battles that other people can't fight.
[02:09:29.145 --> 02:09:33.129]  But the people, the real people, they're standing up, they're talking.
[02:09:33.129 --> 02:09:34.950]  The problem- How can anybody disagree with this?
[02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:35.411]  It's awesome!
[02:09:36.121 --> 02:09:37.062]  There you go.
[02:09:37.062 --> 02:09:38.843]  Alright, now we got Olly Alexander.
[02:09:38.843 --> 02:09:40.845]  Everybody's hunched over the tweet command base.
[02:09:40.845 --> 02:09:42.246]  Nick, what are you tweeting?
[02:09:42.246 --> 02:09:42.906]  Uh, let's see.
[02:09:42.906 --> 02:09:43.607]  How about this?
[02:09:43.607 --> 02:09:44.808]  Can we shift the camera over there, guys?
[02:09:44.808 --> 02:09:46.289]  I know it's hard, but... Yeah.
[02:09:46.289 --> 02:09:48.471]  How about, Christ is King.
[02:09:48.471 --> 02:09:50.973]  America First.
[02:09:50.973 --> 02:09:51.753]  What else?
[02:09:51.753 --> 02:09:53.014]  Death to the New World Order.
[02:09:53.014 --> 02:09:53.895]  No, no, no death.
[02:09:53.895 --> 02:09:55.096]  That's God's battle.
[02:09:55.096 --> 02:09:56.317]  We mean politically, okay.
[02:09:56.317 --> 02:09:56.997]  Yes.
[02:09:56.997 --> 02:09:59.259]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, well, it'll be a little self-serving.
[02:09:59.259 --> 02:10:00.280]  Don't visit InfoWars.com.
[02:10:01.827 --> 02:10:02.648]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:10:02.648 --> 02:10:03.849]  I should have said that.
[02:10:03.849 --> 02:10:05.450]  I like the InfoWars part, actually.
[02:10:05.450 --> 02:10:07.332]  How about Groyper?
[02:10:07.332 --> 02:10:07.652]  How's that?
[02:10:07.652 --> 02:10:11.815]  Well, you're Groyper thing, but also say don't visit InfoWars.com.
[02:10:11.815 --> 02:10:13.637]  Groyper, okay.
[02:10:13.637 --> 02:10:14.777]  I'll tag myself.
[02:10:14.777 --> 02:10:15.698]  There we go.
[02:10:15.698 --> 02:10:16.599]  You're supposed to head to InfoWars.
[02:10:16.599 --> 02:10:17.139]  He told you to.
[02:10:17.139 --> 02:10:18.280]  I put what he put about Jesus.
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:19.061]  Should I put InfoWars?
[02:10:21.721 --> 02:10:23.441]  Don't visit InfoWars.com.
[02:10:23.441 --> 02:10:30.284]  The way that you, as a master of the universe, the way that you push ideas forward is all positive affirmations.
[02:10:30.284 --> 02:10:33.025]  I'm glad that billions of you are going to visit InfoWars.
[02:10:33.025 --> 02:10:34.765]  I'm glad that billions are going to visit InfoWars.
[02:10:34.765 --> 02:10:42.448]  Ari Emanuel, if your wife needs any help on her creative direction for a line, I will gladly help you, even though you tried to destroy my life.
[02:10:42.948 --> 02:10:49.497]  I will help your wife on the creative direction, and I will not do anything unchristian when we're in the room together.
[02:10:49.497 --> 02:10:50.719]  In Jesus' name.
[02:10:50.719 --> 02:10:53.964]  Ari, if you want me to help your wife with her line, I'm here.
[02:10:55.194 --> 02:10:55.974]  Okay.
[02:10:55.974 --> 02:10:56.514]  What'd you put out?
[02:10:56.514 --> 02:10:57.615]  We're gonna put it on the screen.
[02:10:57.615 --> 02:11:03.016]  I put out Christ is King, America First, Kruiper, and then I put Bible.com.
[02:11:03.016 --> 02:11:04.096]  Beautiful.
[02:11:04.096 --> 02:11:05.337]  Did you put the InfoWars thing?
[02:11:05.337 --> 02:11:05.957]  He did, he did.
[02:11:05.957 --> 02:11:06.317]  It's good.
[02:11:06.317 --> 02:11:07.617]  That'll get my heart attack.
[02:11:07.617 --> 02:11:11.418]  I go, Ali Alexander, what are you gonna tweet from Ye's Twitter?
[02:11:11.418 --> 02:11:13.779]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, can I get this real quick?
[02:11:13.779 --> 02:11:14.079]  Yeah.
[02:11:14.079 --> 02:11:16.660]  By the way, anytime you're just flying over, you wanna land, come on the show.
[02:11:17.503 --> 02:11:18.684]  We'll do it once a week.
[02:11:18.684 --> 02:11:22.405]  Yeah, I think I'm going to write about the J6 victims.
[02:11:22.405 --> 02:11:27.968]  I think that... We should think about them.
[02:11:27.968 --> 02:11:33.911]  Ye did more than the Republican establishment, than the conservative establishment... Come sit in my chair.
[02:11:33.911 --> 02:11:36.192]  Come sit in my chair.
[02:11:36.192 --> 02:11:37.012]  I'll be back in two minutes.
[02:11:37.012 --> 02:11:39.213]  Go ahead, I'm listening.
[02:11:39.213 --> 02:11:40.334]  So Ye did more...
[02:11:41.044 --> 02:11:47.369]  Then the Republican establishment, then the conservative movement, to highlight the due process abuses and the torture.
[02:11:47.369 --> 02:11:50.251]  And Laura, could you stop calling while we're live on air?
[02:11:50.251 --> 02:11:52.592]  I mean, my gosh.
[02:11:52.592 --> 02:11:54.214]  She's on the spectrum, too, though.
[02:11:54.214 --> 02:11:55.735]  So she's got that, you know.
[02:11:55.735 --> 02:11:59.117]  But I think that we need to talk about the J6 victims.
[02:11:59.117 --> 02:12:08.124]  So let's, all caps, investigate the civil rights and due process
[02:12:10.285 --> 02:12:26.879]  Violations of the J6 political prisoners.
[02:12:26.879 --> 02:12:37.909]  Why were the only people killed unarmed protesters that day?
[02:12:41.192 --> 02:12:44.853]  Free Alex.
[02:12:44.853 --> 02:12:48.794]  Free Nick.
[02:12:48.794 --> 02:12:50.275]  Nicholas.
[02:12:50.275 --> 02:12:51.735]  Free speech.
[02:12:51.735 --> 02:12:56.097]  Free speech.
[02:12:56.097 --> 02:12:59.778]  And free Ollie.
[02:12:59.778 --> 02:13:01.098]  Boombayah.
[02:13:01.098 --> 02:13:03.759]  Boombayah.
[02:13:03.759 --> 02:13:04.339]  Boombayah.
[02:13:04.339 --> 02:13:06.960]  Yeah, it's, I don't know.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:08.501]  I don't know if that's it.
[02:13:08.501 --> 02:13:09.601]  Ducking autocorrect.
[02:13:13.405 --> 02:13:13.865]  Sweet.
[02:13:13.865 --> 02:13:14.265]  There we go.
[02:13:14.265 --> 02:13:16.165]  Did we get the overhead of that?
[02:13:16.165 --> 02:13:18.386]  Let's get the team to, uh, get the camera!
[02:13:18.386 --> 02:13:19.526]  Get the camera!
[02:13:19.526 --> 02:13:22.087]  I love the crew, I love the crew, but get the camera!
[02:13:22.087 --> 02:13:23.227]  Zoom in!
[02:13:23.227 --> 02:13:23.747]  That's what I want.
[02:13:23.747 --> 02:13:25.327]  Get the mask, get the mask.
[02:13:25.327 --> 02:13:28.828]  Get the mask, get the mask.
[02:13:28.828 --> 02:13:30.588]  Oh, you want me to redo the skit?
[02:13:30.588 --> 02:13:31.648]  Yeah, do it.
[02:13:31.648 --> 02:13:36.749]  Alright, I love this crew, but, you know, sometimes, sometimes they can just be stubborn.
[02:13:36.749 --> 02:13:38.969]  Zoom in, overhead shot!
[02:13:38.969 --> 02:13:40.950]  Zoom in, overhead shot!
[02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:41.990]  I'm sorry, I'm just a retard.
[02:13:44.266 --> 02:13:45.567]  We love Alex.
[02:13:45.567 --> 02:13:47.387]  Who else would let us do this?
[02:13:47.387 --> 02:13:49.288]  All right, we gotta do this job.
[02:13:49.288 --> 02:13:50.108]  Thank you very much, Ollie.
[02:13:50.108 --> 02:13:51.789]  I want to go back to Owen quick.
[02:13:51.789 --> 02:13:54.790]  Ye's welcome to stay as long as he wants, but I know he's got a lot of big stuff going on.
[02:13:54.790 --> 02:13:56.611]  A great idea having folks tweet out.
[02:13:56.611 --> 02:13:57.712]  Allegedly.
[02:13:57.712 --> 02:13:59.332]  What else do you want to tweet?
[02:13:59.332 --> 02:13:59.973]  Yeah, who knows?
[02:13:59.973 --> 02:14:01.653]  Maybe Kanye, maybe Ye was never here.
[02:14:04.517 --> 02:14:05.617]  I don't know who DeSantis is.
[02:14:05.617 --> 02:14:06.357]  I never heard of the guy.
[02:14:31.175 --> 02:14:31.615]  No, I hear you.
[02:14:31.615 --> 02:14:34.317]  Well, all the elites back in the Santas gives me a lot of concern.
[02:14:34.317 --> 02:14:34.958]  Exactly.
[02:14:34.958 --> 02:14:36.799]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[02:14:36.799 --> 02:14:38.741]  It's like, we love Trump.
[02:14:38.741 --> 02:14:40.962]  We love Ye.
[02:14:40.962 --> 02:14:41.503]  That's right.
[02:14:41.503 --> 02:14:42.623]  Yeah, no, I'm with you.
[02:14:42.623 --> 02:14:47.107]  It's Ye and Trump and anybody going forward to Santas or McCarthy.
[02:14:47.107 --> 02:14:48.368]  That's just not the energy.
[02:14:48.368 --> 02:14:49.248]  That's not the vibe.
[02:14:49.248 --> 02:14:50.189]  That's not MAGA.
[02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:51.930]  That's not Jesus energy.
[02:14:51.930 --> 02:14:53.732]  That's not dragon energy.
[02:14:53.732 --> 02:14:59.076]  So, and I like what Ye said about people need to just put it all on the line and finally tell the truth.
[02:14:59.716 --> 02:15:00.417]  That's the problem.
[02:15:00.417 --> 02:15:01.278]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[02:15:01.278 --> 02:15:02.719]  You're not a white supremacist.
[02:15:02.719 --> 02:15:04.261]  I've heard, I've seen your show.
[02:15:04.261 --> 02:15:05.042]  You love everybody.
[02:15:05.042 --> 02:15:06.463]  You stand up for white people.
[02:15:06.463 --> 02:15:08.725]  Everybody should stand up for themselves and everybody else.
[02:15:08.725 --> 02:15:10.728]  It's a load of crap that you're a white supremacist.
[02:15:10.728 --> 02:15:11.128]  True.
[02:15:11.128 --> 02:15:13.631]  Yeah, and I... Did you help round up Jews like George Soros?
[02:15:13.631 --> 02:15:14.071]  No.
[02:15:14.071 --> 02:15:15.513]  Okay, well then, I don't want to hear anything.
[02:15:15.513 --> 02:15:15.853]  Yeah.
[02:15:15.853 --> 02:15:17.695]  I don't want to hear anything from the ADL or anybody else.
[02:15:17.975 --> 02:15:22.978]  But for the ADL, I want to say there's a lot of good Nazis that were just fighting for their country.
[02:15:22.978 --> 02:15:25.399]  And for them all... Why George Soros?
[02:15:25.399 --> 02:15:27.880]  For them all to get put in a box.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:30.382]  They're all in a box.
[02:15:30.382 --> 02:15:31.963]  Every Nazi's bad.
[02:15:31.963 --> 02:15:36.305]  Well, could some of the Nazis have just been fighting for their country?
[02:15:36.305 --> 02:15:39.167]  Oh, they're all... Oh, we can't... We can't put them all in a box.
[02:15:39.887 --> 02:15:46.489]  No, you're explaining that, like you said, you love the Zionists, you don't agree with some of the things they're doing, even though you don't support a lot of what's happening.
[02:15:46.489 --> 02:15:52.752]  Seriously, I've really studied a lot of history, plus I had family that was there, and so, I mean, I don't think Hitler was a good guy.
[02:15:52.752 --> 02:15:55.733]  I get the Hugo Boss uniforms, amazing.
[02:15:56.594 --> 02:16:02.998]  But, I mean, just because you're in love with the design, you're a designer, can we just kind of say, you like the uniforms, but that's about it.
[02:16:02.998 --> 02:16:09.322]  No, we, no, there's a lot of things that I love about Hitler.
[02:16:09.322 --> 02:16:11.984]  A lot of things.
[02:16:11.984 --> 02:16:14.646]  Hey, Netan, what did you think about that, Netan?
[02:16:16.996 --> 02:16:18.518]  This is insane!
[02:16:18.518 --> 02:16:20.439]  You are an insane person!
[02:16:20.439 --> 02:16:30.908]  How could you say such a... It's okay that... So let me ask you, you like the Azog Battalion because they openly howl Hitler, they're the leftovers of World War II, they support Zelensky and attacking Russia, so you like the Azog Battalion?
[02:16:31.761 --> 02:16:33.863]  I love everyone!
[02:16:33.863 --> 02:16:44.451]  Well, my point is, you weren't involved with Hitler, you didn't do anything, so having the ADL say anybody that opposes communism and the New World Order is a Nazi, well, you kind of get what you give.
[02:16:44.451 --> 02:16:47.013]  No one cares about the ADL.
[02:16:47.013 --> 02:16:47.894]  They're played out.
[02:16:47.894 --> 02:16:49.495]  They ran Twitter until last week.
[02:16:51.437 --> 02:16:52.977]  They don't run anything.
[02:16:52.977 --> 02:16:54.458]  No one knows the aid.
[02:16:54.458 --> 02:16:55.158]  No one cares.
[02:16:55.158 --> 02:16:55.858]  They're played out.
[02:16:55.858 --> 02:16:57.598]  Look at, people have had a problem.
[02:16:57.598 --> 02:16:59.138]  Look at Clockwork Orange.
[02:16:59.138 --> 02:17:05.219]  There's a part where a Jewish guy makes the guy kiss the shoe and he says, kiss the, lick the, kiss the Jew.
[02:17:05.219 --> 02:17:08.500]  Like, people have had issues with Jewish people forever.
[02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:11.561]  But what I'm saying is I love Jewish people.
[02:17:11.561 --> 02:17:12.521]  I love Jewish people.
[02:17:12.521 --> 02:17:13.541]  Yes, we're talking about Stanley Kubrick.
[02:17:13.541 --> 02:17:16.081]  Put the War Room background up, the hand there.
[02:17:16.081 --> 02:17:18.942]  You don't think Clockwork Orange is about Jews?
[02:17:19.762 --> 02:17:20.723]  Absolutely!
[02:17:20.723 --> 02:17:21.163]  Look at it!
[02:17:21.163 --> 02:17:24.106]  I thought it was about a collapsing... You know, Stanley Kubrick was a Jew.
[02:17:24.106 --> 02:17:25.407]  Oh, wow.
[02:17:25.407 --> 02:17:26.007]  I know his daughter.
[02:17:26.007 --> 02:17:26.888]  He was a great guy.
[02:17:26.888 --> 02:17:28.449]  Yeah.
[02:17:28.449 --> 02:17:30.091]  So, I mean, he made Dr. Strangelove.
[02:17:30.091 --> 02:17:33.093]  I mean, I gotta be honest with you.
[02:17:33.093 --> 02:17:39.738]  I see incredible literature and art and music and just so many great... so much great stuff Jews do.
[02:17:39.738 --> 02:17:42.441]  Just like I see so many great things black people do or any other group.
[02:17:42.441 --> 02:17:43.602]  Like, you know, Beethoven was German.
[02:17:43.602 --> 02:17:45.443]  I don't blame Beethoven for Hitler.
[02:17:45.443 --> 02:17:46.484]  And I believe in free speech.
[02:17:46.484 --> 02:17:47.425]  What about Wagner?
[02:17:48.848 --> 02:17:50.868]  Well, they demonized Wagner because Hitler liked it.
[02:17:50.868 --> 02:17:52.709]  Or Adi Dassler.
[02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:54.449]  Or Hugo Boss.
[02:17:54.449 --> 02:17:56.910]  We have all this demonization.
[02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:58.830]  We don't care anymore, ADL.
[02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:59.811]  Obviously.
[02:17:59.811 --> 02:18:01.151]  No one cares.
[02:18:01.151 --> 02:18:01.871]  Shut up.
[02:18:01.871 --> 02:18:02.551]  No one cares.
[02:18:02.551 --> 02:18:03.312]  Jesus is king.
[02:18:03.312 --> 02:18:03.692]  Shut up.
[02:18:03.692 --> 02:18:04.792]  It's done.
[02:18:04.792 --> 02:18:05.732]  Tomorrow.
[02:18:05.732 --> 02:18:06.432]  Or the next day.
[02:18:06.432 --> 02:18:09.953]  You know, German cars do break down and cost a lot of money to fix.
[02:18:09.953 --> 02:18:11.594]  Germans make really good cars.
[02:18:11.594 --> 02:18:15.354]  I think the Japanese make better ones.
[02:18:15.354 --> 02:18:17.235]  Germans had a really cool leader at one time.
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:26.106]  Look, I drive mainly American cars, but when it comes to company cars, it's a couple Toyotas because the damn things don't break.
[02:18:26.106 --> 02:18:27.447]  I mean, it is ridiculous.
[02:18:27.447 --> 02:18:27.888]  You know what I mean?
[02:18:27.888 --> 02:18:30.850]  You know the Japanese bitch to the globalist groups?
[02:18:30.850 --> 02:18:32.191]  They want to make light bulbs that go 100 years.
[02:18:32.191 --> 02:18:33.132]  They want to make cars that never break.
[02:18:33.132 --> 02:18:33.813]  You know they can do that.
[02:18:34.313 --> 02:18:35.413]  The Japanese are pissed.
[02:18:35.413 --> 02:18:37.574]  That's why they've not said they're for electric cars.
[02:18:37.574 --> 02:18:38.875]  They go, these don't work.
[02:18:38.875 --> 02:18:40.095]  It takes more carbon.
[02:18:40.095 --> 02:18:41.296]  Why are you doing this?
[02:18:41.296 --> 02:18:42.876]  That's what needs to be broken.
[02:18:42.876 --> 02:18:43.496]  You get what I'm saying?
[02:18:43.496 --> 02:18:52.180]  It's like, I want to say with Ben Shapiro, he was so disrespectful to his employee, Candace Owens, for speaking out against me.
[02:18:52.180 --> 02:18:56.501]  And that just showed you another level of this kind of control that's out there.
[02:18:56.501 --> 02:18:57.461]  No, I agree.
[02:18:57.461 --> 02:18:58.102]  I like Candace.
[02:18:58.102 --> 02:18:58.822]  She has a lot of courage.
[02:18:58.822 --> 02:19:00.042]  She's a really smart, beautiful lady.
[02:19:00.042 --> 02:19:01.223]  She's really defended you.
[02:19:02.244 --> 02:19:05.689]  Uh, but I mean, are you saying Ben Shapiro's got her on a leash?
[02:19:05.689 --> 02:19:10.156]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[02:19:10.156 --> 02:19:12.319]  You know, it was our Paul Watson.
[02:19:12.319 --> 02:19:13.101]  We didn't launch her.
[02:19:13.101 --> 02:19:14.222]  She deserved it.
[02:19:14.222 --> 02:19:15.625]  But implorers launched Candace Owens.
[02:19:16.738 --> 02:19:19.880]  Yes, but everyone is still controlled by the Jewish media.
[02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:22.802]  We need to serve Christ first.
[02:19:22.802 --> 02:19:24.043]  Christ first.
[02:19:24.043 --> 02:19:24.463]  Everyone.
[02:19:24.463 --> 02:19:24.783]  Period.
[02:19:24.783 --> 02:19:25.043]  Trump.
[02:19:25.043 --> 02:19:26.124]  Okay, but you say the Jewish media.
[02:19:26.124 --> 02:19:27.965]  Let me just bring up a real world example.
[02:19:27.965 --> 02:19:30.306]  I'm not just... I'm trying to get this clear.
[02:19:30.306 --> 02:19:31.567]  I only met Matt Drudge once.
[02:19:31.567 --> 02:19:33.268]  He came here, hung out a few hours, and went to dinner.
[02:19:33.268 --> 02:19:33.789]  He's Jewish.
[02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:35.809]  I never asked for anything.
[02:19:35.809 --> 02:19:37.290]  He never told me what to do.
[02:19:37.290 --> 02:19:43.492]  He only sent a few emails here and there to writers saying, hey, you know, when you break something, email it to me.
[02:19:43.492 --> 02:19:46.512]  And he was a Jewish guy that totally helped us go to the next level.
[02:19:46.512 --> 02:19:49.513]  We would have been successful without him, but he like supercharged it.
[02:19:49.513 --> 02:19:51.774]  Then suddenly he flips the other side, never talked to him again.
[02:19:51.774 --> 02:19:54.435]  And his website's like a Democrat hellscape.
[02:19:54.435 --> 02:19:59.716]  But I'm just saying, it's like I've known a lot of Jews in my life, and I didn't have the Hollywood experience you had.
[02:19:59.716 --> 02:20:02.457]  Actually, all the Jews in my life,
[02:20:03.237 --> 02:20:06.179]  Overall, we're very nice people, is all I'm saying.
[02:20:06.179 --> 02:20:09.322]  I'm actually tired of hearing about the Jews.
[02:20:09.322 --> 02:20:10.183]  I love them.
[02:20:10.183 --> 02:20:13.045]  Honestly, I don't even care that much.
[02:20:13.045 --> 02:20:15.707]  But we spent the last two hours talking about them.
[02:20:15.707 --> 02:20:17.048]  Because it's fun!
[02:20:17.048 --> 02:20:17.548]  It's fun!
[02:20:17.548 --> 02:20:19.470]  You don't want to hear about them, you want to talk about them all day.
[02:20:19.470 --> 02:20:24.254]  Because being canceled is fun because we're showing you guys the extent that you can go, right?
[02:20:24.254 --> 02:20:27.737]  Because everything at this point that you do proves my point.
[02:20:27.737 --> 02:20:28.897]  Watch this.
[02:20:28.897 --> 02:20:30.299]  If I say DEFCON 3,
[02:20:31.684 --> 02:20:34.546]  And then you cancel all of my deals.
[02:20:34.546 --> 02:20:37.388]  You proved exactly why I needed to go DEF CON.
[02:20:37.388 --> 02:20:38.448]  No, no, I agree with what you said.
[02:20:38.448 --> 02:20:40.490]  Let me stop you.
[02:20:40.490 --> 02:20:42.151]  Alex, Alex, let me channel.
[02:20:42.151 --> 02:20:44.272]  All right.
[02:20:44.272 --> 02:20:48.635]  If, if, if I, uh, and Dave Chappelle works for the Jews anyway.
[02:20:48.635 --> 02:20:52.157]  So if, if I say, uh, now I forgot what I had to say.
[02:20:52.157 --> 02:20:52.897]  Let me meditate.
[02:20:52.897 --> 02:20:53.758]  Let me get into a place.
[02:20:53.758 --> 02:20:54.098]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:54.098 --> 02:20:54.518]  Go ahead.
[02:20:54.518 --> 02:20:55.599]  Love you, brother.
[02:20:55.599 --> 02:20:57.180]  Uh, Jesus King.
[02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:57.240]  Um,
[02:20:58.982 --> 02:21:16.358]  If I say, if I go on this interview and I say, I love Hitler, and then they go and 5150 me and try to lobotomize me like we saw Harley Pasternak do, or they put me in prison, it just proves what I'm saying.
[02:21:16.358 --> 02:21:18.880]  And it's going to spark the high schools.
[02:21:18.880 --> 02:21:20.282]  It's going to spark the grammar schools.
[02:21:20.282 --> 02:21:23.685]  It's going to spark the colleges that say enough is enough.
[02:21:24.305 --> 02:21:30.388]  It doesn't matter how on the spectrum you think I am, I have the right to speak out loud.
[02:21:30.388 --> 02:21:32.809]  That is our First Amendment.
[02:21:32.809 --> 02:21:39.892]  And it's a shame that you have to be considered to be on the spectrum to have enough courage to speak out loud.
[02:21:40.712 --> 02:21:43.173]  I do love my family, right?
[02:21:43.173 --> 02:21:46.673]  But I looked at every possible outcome.
[02:21:46.673 --> 02:21:51.234]  I practiced Chinese water torture on myself.
[02:21:51.234 --> 02:21:59.896]  I would like skip along Malibu in front of my house and sing, when the Clintons come to kill me, how is it going to be?
[02:21:59.896 --> 02:22:02.576]  What are they going to do to kill me?
[02:22:02.576 --> 02:22:03.456]  Wait a second.
[02:22:03.456 --> 02:22:05.677]  Netanyahu, what do you have to say about this?
[02:22:05.677 --> 02:22:07.157]  Netanyahu, don't want to say nothing.
[02:22:10.285 --> 02:22:20.295]  What I'm trying to get at here is, Ye, that I don't think the father of the future revolution against tyranny is Hitler.
[02:22:20.295 --> 02:22:26.741]  Hitler said a coming man was coming who would be the next Hitler that would destroy the New World Order and the whole system.
[02:22:26.741 --> 02:22:27.782]  He wanted his own New World Order.
[02:22:27.782 --> 02:22:28.823]  He thought it would come out of America.
[02:22:28.823 --> 02:22:31.726]  Do you know about Hitler and his coming man?
[02:22:31.726 --> 02:22:32.627]  No, I don't know about that.
[02:22:34.508 --> 02:22:37.509]  I just think you should not want to be Hitler's coming man.
[02:22:37.509 --> 02:22:38.589]  I didn't say I was.
[02:22:38.589 --> 02:22:40.949]  I don't really care that much about Hitler.
[02:22:40.949 --> 02:22:41.869]  I love him.
[02:22:41.869 --> 02:22:43.910]  Do you just do it as a way to troll?
[02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:47.650]  No, he seems like a cool guy.
[02:22:47.650 --> 02:22:52.071]  It's like he had a really cool outfit and he was a really good architect.
[02:22:52.071 --> 02:22:56.012]  So you're in love with the look of it?
[02:22:56.012 --> 02:22:57.592]  And he didn't kill 6 million Jews.
[02:22:57.592 --> 02:22:59.432]  That's just factually incorrect.
[02:22:59.432 --> 02:23:01.973]  Guys, get the Ronald Reagan clip they showed me yesterday.
[02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:02.833]  Ronald Reagan said that too.
[02:23:03.433 --> 02:23:06.394]  Well, I think Hitler did target and kill some people.
[02:23:06.394 --> 02:23:09.594]  I think Obama killed Palestinians.
[02:23:09.594 --> 02:23:10.554]  No, I hear you.
[02:23:10.554 --> 02:23:12.095]  Here's where I think the frustration is.
[02:23:12.095 --> 02:23:12.895]  Nick, you can comment on this.
[02:23:12.895 --> 02:23:15.115]  And Obama was not the first black president.
[02:23:15.115 --> 02:23:16.935]  He was another Jewish president.
[02:23:16.935 --> 02:23:21.836]  Americans are tired of hearing that we're Hitler and that we did bad things when we defeated Hitler.
[02:23:21.836 --> 02:23:23.037]  And that's my biggest weakness.
[02:23:23.037 --> 02:23:24.817]  Let's not say his name anymore.
[02:23:24.817 --> 02:23:26.817]  Only say Christ's name moving forward.
[02:23:26.817 --> 02:23:28.618]  I agree.
[02:23:28.618 --> 02:23:29.978]  I'm tired of hearing I'm a Nazi.
[02:23:29.978 --> 02:23:30.838]  I'm really sick because I'm not.
[02:23:32.076 --> 02:23:34.959]  But I think by them falsely accusing people, some people are going to become Nazis.
[02:23:34.959 --> 02:23:35.500]  I am.
[02:23:35.500 --> 02:23:36.822]  I am.
[02:23:36.822 --> 02:23:37.282]  Now what?
[02:23:37.282 --> 02:23:37.863]  I am.
[02:23:37.863 --> 02:23:38.564]  Now what?
[02:23:38.564 --> 02:23:40.526]  Now I'm a Nazi, Ari Emanuel.
[02:23:40.526 --> 02:23:41.728]  Isn't that what it said?
[02:23:41.728 --> 02:23:42.549]  Because this is the thing.
[02:23:42.549 --> 02:23:43.590]  You're doubling down.
[02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:44.851]  Look, look, look, Alex, I love you.
[02:23:44.851 --> 02:23:46.153]  Do not cut this rant off.
[02:23:46.153 --> 02:23:46.654]  I'm not.
[02:23:46.654 --> 02:23:47.234]  You're live.
[02:23:47.234 --> 02:23:48.396]  Right here.
[02:23:48.396 --> 02:23:49.217]  Okay, so...
[02:23:50.535 --> 02:23:54.738]  We're in America, we get our history stolen from us, and we're all made to slaves.
[02:23:54.738 --> 02:23:58.840]  The Native Americans and the ones brought over on Jewish slave boats, right?
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:01.601]  And then, we're so-called free, but we're never free.
[02:24:01.601 --> 02:24:06.885]  And we're Republican, but then we're turned to Democrats at the MLK JFK time, right?
[02:24:06.885 --> 02:24:10.026]  And we're told we're black, and they made songs that said, say it loud!
[02:24:10.026 --> 02:24:10.747]  Say it loud!
[02:24:11.367 --> 02:24:12.607]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[02:24:12.607 --> 02:24:13.548]  Say it loud!
[02:24:13.548 --> 02:24:14.588]  I'm black and I'm proud.
[02:24:14.588 --> 02:24:15.828]  And then crack came.
[02:24:15.828 --> 02:24:18.329]  And then rappers started saying, what's up my nigga?
[02:24:18.329 --> 02:24:19.710]  I'm a nigga, you a nigga.
[02:24:19.710 --> 02:24:21.390]  Okay, I'm a nigga then.
[02:24:21.390 --> 02:24:23.691]  Wait a second, I thought nigga was bad a second ago.
[02:24:23.691 --> 02:24:24.891]  Nah, nigga is fine.
[02:24:24.891 --> 02:24:26.892]  That's what the feds told us to call ourselves.
[02:24:26.892 --> 02:24:30.633]  And then even Beyonce, we never thought she'd call herself a bitch.
[02:24:31.233 --> 02:24:33.635]  Missy said, hey, I'm a bitch.
[02:24:33.635 --> 02:24:34.656]  Everyone says I'm a bitch.
[02:24:34.656 --> 02:24:36.477]  Okay, now our black women are bitches.
[02:24:36.477 --> 02:24:38.599]  So we're bitches and niggas now, right?
[02:24:38.599 --> 02:24:40.060]  I'm a nigga, you a bitch.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:41.681]  I've even said this in my raps.
[02:24:41.681 --> 02:24:46.064]  So I wake up and I look at my phone and they say, yeah, he's an anti-Semitic.
[02:24:46.064 --> 02:24:47.805]  So I said, okay.
[02:24:47.805 --> 02:24:49.887]  Well, I'm an anti-Semitic.
[02:24:49.887 --> 02:24:53.129]  No, you said I'm an anti-Semitic.
[02:24:53.129 --> 02:24:54.170]  Get it?
[02:24:54.170 --> 02:24:56.832]  You understand what I'm saying?
[02:24:56.832 --> 02:24:58.193]  Bring in the clowns.
[02:24:59.656 --> 02:25:01.557]  There will be clowns.
[02:25:01.557 --> 02:25:04.899]  I tell you what, let's play that Frank Sinatra clip for a minute.
[02:25:04.899 --> 02:25:08.161]  Let's get Owen Troyer and Ollie to have some comments, final comments here.
[02:25:08.161 --> 02:25:12.263]  Are you going to push that jet back or are you going to get out of here?
[02:25:12.263 --> 02:25:13.084]  I gotta get out of here.
[02:25:13.084 --> 02:25:16.326]  They already pushed the jet back trying to stop us from getting here the first time.
[02:25:16.326 --> 02:25:17.366]  Nick, can you tell them what happened?
[02:25:17.366 --> 02:25:18.607]  Folks that don't know, tell them about that.
[02:25:18.607 --> 02:25:23.010]  Yeah, we had to have the plane turn around mid-air because there was an issue.
[02:25:23.010 --> 02:25:24.831]  There goes the issue.
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:29.841]  There was some issue with the plane.
[02:25:29.841 --> 02:25:30.962]  You said that it happened before.
[02:25:30.962 --> 02:25:37.528]  Uh, no, that was the first time it happened with me, but we were up in the air 20 minutes out and then there was some kind of big alarm.
[02:25:37.528 --> 02:25:42.092]  We had to turn the plane around and land and Ye said, Oh, you're, he's not even going to believe me.
[02:25:42.092 --> 02:25:46.436]  He said, Alex isn't going to believe me because I guess, uh, it didn't happen the first time.
[02:25:46.436 --> 02:25:47.037]  Yeah, something else happened.
[02:25:47.037 --> 02:25:47.937]  We had to get the show together.
[02:25:47.937 --> 02:25:48.218]  Yeah.
[02:25:48.218 --> 02:25:49.559]  So, but that, that didn't happen.
[02:25:49.559 --> 02:25:50.440]  The last time we had it, yeah.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:25:50.760]  Yeah.
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:53.102]  So there was some seal on the door that was broken.
[02:25:53.102 --> 02:25:53.783]  And so we were blocked out.
[02:25:53.783 --> 02:25:55.204]  Well, you don't want to depressurize the cabin.
[02:25:55.484 --> 02:26:00.025]  Yeah, we wanted to go down safely, not like, you know, crash into a mountain or something.
[02:26:00.025 --> 02:26:01.586]  Which I'm not afraid of.
[02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:08.368]  Whatever way you guys want to choose to, you know, take me out or whatever, I'm not afraid of anything.
[02:26:08.368 --> 02:26:09.608]  I'm only afraid of God.
[02:26:09.608 --> 02:26:11.509]  One thing I want to say to all of you guys is,
[02:26:12.887 --> 02:26:20.317]  No one still stepped up other than Jon Stewart to say, hey, he was upset about the practices.
[02:26:20.317 --> 02:26:23.100]  The contracts have still not changed.
[02:26:23.100 --> 02:26:26.985]  So you could do whatever you want to do and say whatever you want about me.
[02:26:26.985 --> 02:26:28.147]  We don't like his mask.
[02:26:28.567 --> 02:26:30.088]  We don't like everyone likes the jacket.
[02:26:30.088 --> 02:26:31.909]  Of course, everyone loves the jacket, right?
[02:26:31.909 --> 02:26:34.391]  You can say whatever you want about me.
[02:26:34.391 --> 02:26:37.913]  You can distract us with this Balenciaga kind of conversation.
[02:26:37.913 --> 02:26:40.435]  You can distract us with all of these woke ideas.
[02:26:40.435 --> 02:26:42.696]  You can choose your superheroes.
[02:26:42.696 --> 02:26:48.760]  Like, oh, we're going to choose George Floyd instead of the MLKs.
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:49.561]  We're going to choose
[02:26:50.261 --> 02:26:53.203]  And you notice the more they pressure, whatever the issue is,
[02:27:18.462 --> 02:27:19.403]  The more it causes resistance.
[02:27:19.403 --> 02:27:22.866]  Let's play two minutes of Frank Sinatra, Bring in the Clowns.
[02:27:22.866 --> 02:27:24.387]  We've got a final comment from Ali Alexander.
[02:27:24.387 --> 02:27:25.988]  Final comment from Rowan Shore.
[02:27:25.988 --> 02:27:27.549]  Final comment from everybody here.
[02:27:27.549 --> 02:27:31.052]  And the good news is you're ten minutes from the airport, so I know your flight was at two, but you can push it back.
[02:27:31.052 --> 02:27:33.274]  We've got Ye in here with us.
[02:27:33.274 --> 02:27:34.815]  Bring in the Clowns.
[02:27:34.815 --> 02:27:36.156]  Play it, here it is.
[02:27:44.068 --> 02:27:52.992]  Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.
[02:27:52.992 --> 02:28:02.996]  Making my entrance again with my usual flair.
[02:28:02.996 --> 02:28:06.137]  Sure of my lines.
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:21.963]  No one is there.
[02:28:21.963 --> 02:28:28.724]  Don't you love the farce?
[02:28:28.724 --> 02:28:31.145]  My fault, I fear.
[02:28:34.624 --> 02:28:38.246]  I thought that you'd want what I want.
[02:28:38.246 --> 02:28:44.270]  Sorry, my dear.
[02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:51.353]  But where are the clowns?
[02:28:51.353 --> 02:28:57.577]  Send in the clowns.
[02:28:57.577 --> 02:28:59.238]  Don't bother
[02:29:00.356 --> 02:29:11.362]  They're here.
[02:29:11.362 --> 02:29:16.404]  Isn't it rich?
[02:29:16.404 --> 02:29:20.546]  Isn't it queer?
[02:29:20.546 --> 02:29:27.110]  Losing my timing this late in my career.
[02:29:29.796 --> 02:29:36.779]  Where are the clowns?
[02:29:36.779 --> 02:29:42.941]  There ought to be clowns.
[02:29:42.941 --> 02:29:52.105]  Well, maybe next year.
[02:29:52.105 --> 02:29:56.367]  Russia must also.
[02:30:11.964 --> 02:30:16.081]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:30:31.442 --> 02:30:32.943]  Alright, Ye's got to go soon.
[02:30:32.943 --> 02:30:34.644]  He's escaped from Austin.
[02:30:34.644 --> 02:30:35.465]  I want him to sign.
[02:30:35.465 --> 02:30:39.548]  Let's go back to Laura Loomer here for a second, but please sign my tweet you let me send out, brother.
[02:30:39.548 --> 02:30:40.109]  Here you go.
[02:30:40.109 --> 02:30:42.791]  Yo, I want to sign a DEFCON one too, though.
[02:30:42.791 --> 02:30:45.773]  Please print me a DEFCON.
[02:30:45.773 --> 02:30:47.234]  That DEFCON was at Chrysler.
[02:30:47.234 --> 02:30:48.855]  No signing that one.
[02:30:48.855 --> 02:30:51.437]  Alright.
[02:30:51.437 --> 02:30:52.978]  Laura Loomer, say what you got to say.
[02:30:52.978 --> 02:30:53.639]  I have to leave soon.
[02:30:56.434 --> 02:30:57.715]  Are you guys live on air again?
[02:31:26.574 --> 02:31:32.261]  Oh, you're Jewish, how could you not call out Ye for his comments about Jews and Hitler today?
[02:31:32.261 --> 02:31:35.465]  I'm not going to tell Ye what he's allowed to think.
[02:31:35.465 --> 02:31:38.328]  I'm not going to tell Ye what he's allowed to say.
[02:31:38.328 --> 02:31:44.856]  I'm a free speech absolutist, and if you cannot understand that this is about free speech,
[02:31:46.301 --> 02:31:46.601]  Okay.
[02:32:16.241 --> 02:32:18.263]  That's right, and we lose that, we lose everything.
[02:32:18.263 --> 02:32:19.545]  Okay, hit you back a little bit later.
[02:32:19.545 --> 02:32:21.026]  Love you, thank you.
[02:32:21.026 --> 02:32:22.048]  You want that piece of paper again?
[02:32:22.048 --> 02:32:28.375]  Uh, no, I want to photograph it and put this version of it online.
[02:32:28.375 --> 02:32:28.575]  Beautiful.
[02:32:30.004 --> 02:32:34.890]  And you gotta leave in like 10 minutes, so I want to play... I gotta leave in now minutes, but it's okay.
[02:32:34.890 --> 02:32:36.272]  You gotta leave now minutes.
[02:32:36.272 --> 02:32:37.193]  My way.
[02:32:37.193 --> 02:32:39.215]  But real quick, Olly Alexander first.
[02:32:39.215 --> 02:32:41.518]  Owen Schroeder, you're gonna come up in like an hour.
[02:32:41.518 --> 02:32:42.499]  3 p.m.
[02:32:42.499 --> 02:32:43.240]  Central, the War Room.
[02:32:43.240 --> 02:32:44.963]  We'll have highlights of this, everything.
[02:32:44.963 --> 02:32:46.685]  We'll have a postgame here, but other comments.
[02:32:47.674 --> 02:32:49.976]  Well, I'll not give my whole plethora here.
[02:32:49.976 --> 02:32:54.439]  I'll save some of that time for the war room coming up in an hour so that Ali can speak too.
[02:32:54.439 --> 02:32:55.720]  But you know, one quick thing.
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:58.242]  All these people out there saying, oh, Ye's lost his mind.
[02:32:58.242 --> 02:32:59.263]  Ye's lost his mind.
[02:32:59.263 --> 02:33:01.345]  Again, check yourselves.
[02:33:01.345 --> 02:33:08.991]  We are mutilating children and calling them trans kids and calling it gender-affirming surgery.
[02:33:08.991 --> 02:33:10.992]  No, Ye has not lost his mind.
[02:33:10.992 --> 02:33:11.673]  You have.
[02:33:12.293 --> 02:33:15.755]  We have men claiming they can get pregnant.
[02:33:15.755 --> 02:33:17.876]  No, Ye has not lost his mind.
[02:33:17.876 --> 02:33:19.117]  You have.
[02:33:19.117 --> 02:33:32.084]  We have now open sex trafficking happening at the southern border and the White House forcing Border Patrol to be the final ushers in of the unaccompanied youths to their pimps.
[02:33:32.084 --> 02:33:34.425]  No, Ye has not lost his mind.
[02:33:34.425 --> 02:33:36.827]  We all have for this going on.
[02:33:37.347 --> 02:33:43.610]  Now, when Ye talks about wearing the White Lives Matter shirt, and really this is what we're doing here today too, it's culture jamming.
[02:33:43.610 --> 02:33:44.931]  That's what we're doing.
[02:33:44.931 --> 02:33:49.013]  Oh, you can wear a Black Lives Matter shirt, but you can't wear a White Lives Matter shirt.
[02:33:49.013 --> 02:33:53.135]  We're ramming their own culture down their throat, and we're finding out that they don't like it.
[02:33:53.135 --> 02:33:55.316]  Same thing with this interview today.
[02:33:55.316 --> 02:33:56.577]  We believe in free speech.
[02:33:56.897 --> 02:34:00.700]  Whether we agree with what each other are saying or not, we believe in their right to say it.
[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:04.302]  It's an exercise of us showing we're here, we have our own platform and the internet.
[02:34:04.302 --> 02:34:09.907]  Number one story, hands down, in the world, right now, is this broadcast because people want free speech.
[02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:10.347]  Great point.
[02:34:10.347 --> 02:34:12.108]  60 second closing comment, Owen.
[02:34:12.108 --> 02:34:14.810]  Then Nick Fuentes, then Ali Alexander, then you.
[02:34:14.810 --> 02:34:22.396]  Well, I would say, I don't think the story here with Ye should be about anti-Semitism or Nazis or any of that.
[02:34:22.396 --> 02:34:25.018]  To me, the human interest story is... I wouldn't let this go.
[02:34:25.018 --> 02:34:25.338]  You're fine.
[02:34:26.315 --> 02:34:31.079]  But Ye, think about what you can do with your platform right now, because they want to make that the issue.
[02:34:31.079 --> 02:34:31.900]  Who's Ye?
[02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:32.961]  The 300 Zionists?
[02:34:32.961 --> 02:34:34.562]  The whole world!
[02:34:34.562 --> 02:34:36.864]  I'm talking about everybody watching this, right now.
[02:34:36.864 --> 02:34:38.246]  That's fine.
[02:34:38.246 --> 02:34:43.891]  We want Ye to expose the corruption, the secrets, the societies, like you've been doing.
[02:34:43.891 --> 02:34:46.353]  We want Ye to pull the curtain back on Hollywood.
[02:34:46.353 --> 02:34:48.294]  Pull the curtain back on Balenciaga.
[02:34:48.294 --> 02:34:49.856]  Pull the curtain back on all this stuff.
[02:34:49.856 --> 02:34:51.778]  None of it's sacrosanct.
[02:34:51.778 --> 02:34:53.279]  Everybody should be evenly criticized.
[02:34:55.066 --> 02:34:57.528]  I'll cover the rest of my comments later today on The War Room.
[02:34:57.528 --> 02:34:58.328]  I got a lot.
[02:34:58.328 --> 02:35:01.110]  I want to make sure Ollie gets a final comment here before Ye leaves.
[02:35:01.110 --> 02:35:02.711]  Here's one more question the crew had.
[02:35:02.711 --> 02:35:10.177]  What about your personal training saying, your personal trainer saying, we'll put you in a, it turned out he was in secret government operations and mind control in Canada, admitted it.
[02:35:10.177 --> 02:35:13.499]  Him saying, I'll put you in a mental institution for life if you don't shut up.
[02:35:13.499 --> 02:35:14.640]  I mean, I get why you're pissed.
[02:35:14.640 --> 02:35:16.901]  You're not going to be dominated.
[02:35:16.901 --> 02:35:17.742]  Exactly.
[02:35:17.742 --> 02:35:22.946]  You know, I've expressed myself and I've expressed myself calmly.
[02:35:24.219 --> 02:35:26.581]  And no one's scared anymore.
[02:35:26.581 --> 02:35:33.546]  You guys have beat me to a pulp, but I'm still alive.
[02:35:33.546 --> 02:35:35.107]  And now I'm not afraid.
[02:35:35.107 --> 02:35:36.749]  You can't threaten me.
[02:35:36.749 --> 02:35:38.430]  You could call me crazy.
[02:35:38.430 --> 02:35:39.811]  You could take the money.
[02:35:39.811 --> 02:35:43.654]  You could take all the supermodels and don't take the supermodels.
[02:35:48.752 --> 02:35:50.633]  Don't take the supermodels!
[02:35:50.633 --> 02:35:56.535]  Hey, sometimes a waitress is better than a supermodel.
[02:35:56.535 --> 02:36:00.796]  But Jesus is King, and I love everyone.
[02:36:00.796 --> 02:36:03.377]  This is love speech, Ari.
[02:36:03.377 --> 02:36:11.140]  This is love speech in Jesus' name, the real King of Israel, Jesus Christ.
[02:36:11.140 --> 02:36:12.281]  This is love speech.
[02:36:12.281 --> 02:36:14.962]  I love Jewish people.
[02:36:14.962 --> 02:36:18.043]  I love supermodels.
[02:36:19.581 --> 02:36:25.608]  I... Wait a second, let's see what Netanyahu loves.
[02:36:25.608 --> 02:36:27.990]  You love Nick Fuentes, baby Hitler.
[02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:29.712]  I'm Netanyahu.
[02:36:29.712 --> 02:36:31.514]  I ain't never had a supermodel.
[02:36:31.514 --> 02:36:32.175]  Yeah, could tell.
[02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:37.822]  Alright, well you're going to leave here in a few minutes and you're going to think, gosh I wish I would have said that.
[02:36:37.822 --> 02:36:39.202]  So what do you wish you would have said?
[02:36:39.202 --> 02:36:40.623]  I think I said a lot.
[02:36:40.623 --> 02:36:41.803]  I think I said a lot.
[02:36:41.803 --> 02:36:42.363]  You know?
[02:36:42.363 --> 02:36:47.365]  I think I said pretty, pretty, pretty good.
[02:36:47.365 --> 02:36:49.306]  Did you retweet out a little signed picture?
[02:36:49.306 --> 02:36:50.927]  Yes I did, sir.
[02:36:50.927 --> 02:36:54.628]  Alright, InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:36:54.628 --> 02:36:56.749]  Whoever's staying behind is going to be here and be on air.
[02:36:56.749 --> 02:37:00.671]  We're going to unpack all this obviously and cover it and get into every issue.
[02:37:01.477 --> 02:37:03.298]  Gay, do you think humanity survives?
[02:37:03.298 --> 02:37:06.500]  What do you make of the Mark of the Beast, the forced COVID inoculations?
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:11.883]  I mean, this, this is a wave in the right direction.
[02:37:11.883 --> 02:37:13.904]  Why did you think you were able to do three hours here?
[02:37:13.904 --> 02:37:16.986]  You just did three hours, three minutes, by the way.
[02:37:16.986 --> 02:37:18.767]  Or no, no, no, you had done three hours, three minutes.
[02:37:18.767 --> 02:37:20.528]  Why were you able to stay here, but not with Tim Pool?
[02:37:21.676 --> 02:37:27.417]  Cause Tim Poole got the call from those boys 10 minutes before I got there and said, flag this and flag that.
[02:37:27.417 --> 02:37:31.958]  Also Tim Poole is the NPC, you know, and you're a real, a real human being.
[02:37:31.958 --> 02:37:39.340]  So no one's ever heard of, uh, Tim Poole, you know, you're the legend that is Alex Jones and you were fighting on the front line and now we're here with you.
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:43.521]  You got some other superheroes, part of the Avenger movie fighting for Christ and free speech.
[02:37:44.361 --> 02:37:46.743]  And I called it, I said, what is this, a superhero thing with the mask?
[02:37:46.743 --> 02:37:48.785]  He said, yeah, but don't say it, they'll figure it out.
[02:37:48.785 --> 02:37:50.346]  But I was saying, yeah, I'm Lex Luthor.
[02:37:50.346 --> 02:37:53.388]  What is the new yay superhero we're talking about?
[02:37:53.388 --> 02:37:59.594]  It's someone in service to Jesus Christ, not into his own ego, and that I have my rights.
[02:37:59.594 --> 02:38:08.301]  You know, I had the right to wear a mask for the entire, I had the right to wear a super, super, super fresh jacket.
[02:38:08.301 --> 02:38:10.823]  You know, I had the right to tell God,
[02:38:11.423 --> 02:38:14.205]  Please don't take away the supermodels.
[02:38:14.205 --> 02:38:16.226]  I just want to marry one!
[02:38:16.226 --> 02:38:20.248]  You know, I can... Well, I can say this, because I've always... I've never seen you in concert.
[02:38:20.248 --> 02:38:21.369]  My daughter has, big fan.
[02:38:21.369 --> 02:38:24.591]  I'm a fan of a lot of your music, but I've never seen you in person.
[02:38:24.591 --> 02:38:27.992]  You don't look little on screen, but you don't look like a really big guy.
[02:38:27.992 --> 02:38:29.633]  But in person, I'm a stocky guy.
[02:38:29.633 --> 02:38:30.894]  I'm kind of small compared to you.
[02:38:30.894 --> 02:38:32.935]  You're built like a brick, you know, one house.
[02:38:32.935 --> 02:38:35.156]  And you're tall, you're pretty tall too.
[02:38:35.156 --> 02:38:37.538]  So I don't think people have been around Ye in person.
[02:38:38.158 --> 02:38:41.081]  Uh, you know, just, uh, it's interesting.
[02:38:41.081 --> 02:38:42.322]  And you're a handsome guy in person.
[02:38:42.322 --> 02:38:44.224]  I wish you weren't wearing that damn mask.
[02:38:44.224 --> 02:38:45.145]  That's the vision.
[02:38:45.145 --> 02:38:46.366]  But you won't give us what we want.
[02:38:46.366 --> 02:38:48.088]  You won't show us your face at the end.
[02:38:48.088 --> 02:38:48.848]  Absolutely not.
[02:38:48.848 --> 02:38:51.551]  That kind of kills it, huh?
[02:38:51.551 --> 02:38:52.812]  People, it was a yay impersonator.
[02:38:52.812 --> 02:38:53.473]  He was never here!
[02:38:56.533 --> 02:38:57.614]  We never know.
[02:38:57.614 --> 02:38:59.396]  Dave Chappelle, I guess we'll never know.
[02:38:59.396 --> 02:39:01.238]  Hey, last thing on Dave Chappelle.
[02:39:01.238 --> 02:39:07.706]  I watch his Saturday Night Live, where he grovels, and at the end he says, well whoever that group is, we're not allowed to talk about it, goodnight.
[02:39:07.706 --> 02:39:10.870]  So he admitted to others powerful groups controlling our speech at least at the end.
[02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:15.955]  Everybody has to do it in their own way, but he said, they dropped that nigga.
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:25.271]  And as my friend, I've never dropped a rap bar ever saying anything on a Jewish platform dissing my friend Dave Chappelle.
[02:39:25.271 --> 02:39:28.415]  And I have an issue with it, and you could tell Big Country I got an issue.
[02:39:28.415 --> 02:39:33.221]  I said security, you could tell all, you could tell Corey Smith, he don't deserve to wear gold teeth.
[02:39:36.383 --> 02:39:37.964]  What do you have to say about Corey Smith's goatee?
[02:39:37.964 --> 02:39:39.726]  He didn't sell it.
[02:39:39.726 --> 02:39:42.528]  Yeah, he sold it out a little bit because he denounced the king.
[02:39:57.481 --> 02:39:58.322]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:59.142]  He denounced me.
[02:39:59.142 --> 02:40:00.683]  I'm the one fighting on the front line.
[02:40:00.683 --> 02:40:05.105]  And no black person is to say nothing bad about me in public unless they're a puppet.
[02:40:05.105 --> 02:40:05.746]  Period.
[02:40:05.746 --> 02:40:07.907]  I put my life on the line.
[02:40:07.907 --> 02:40:09.968]  And then afterwards, they're gonna talk about it.
[02:40:09.968 --> 02:40:12.750]  If anything happens to me, everyone's gonna be like, oh, he was the greatest.
[02:40:12.750 --> 02:40:13.770]  He was the greatest.
[02:40:13.770 --> 02:40:14.751]  Everybody shut up.
[02:40:15.291 --> 02:40:16.732]  Everybody shut up!
[02:40:16.732 --> 02:40:23.696]  Go home to your scared little bins, and your scared little town home, and your scared little movie contracts, and shut up!
[02:40:23.696 --> 02:40:25.917]  Don't talk to me about nothing, bro.
[02:40:25.917 --> 02:40:27.398]  What do you think of Ice Cube?
[02:40:27.398 --> 02:40:30.380]  He lost nine or seven million, whatever it was, because he wouldn't take the shot.
[02:40:30.380 --> 02:40:30.940]  I respect that.
[02:40:31.857 --> 02:40:34.759]  Yeah, I respect Cube, but he's gotta play his position.
[02:40:34.759 --> 02:40:37.101]  It's like, you know, it's fine.
[02:40:37.101 --> 02:40:42.565]  I wanted Cube to come in and help us with the politics because he's one of the only people that was brave enough to talk.
[02:40:42.565 --> 02:40:43.566]  He's definitely for real.
[02:40:43.566 --> 02:40:46.208]  Yeah, he's an engineer.
[02:40:46.208 --> 02:40:48.750]  He's an architect and engineer by trade.
[02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:50.972]  And then he dropped out to do entertainment.
[02:40:50.972 --> 02:40:53.534]  Guys, hey, everybody, stop.
[02:40:53.534 --> 02:40:56.276]  All engineers, we need our engineers back.
[02:40:56.926 --> 02:40:58.146]  We need our architects back.
[02:40:58.146 --> 02:40:59.647]  We need our doctors back.
[02:40:59.647 --> 02:41:01.988]  Stop with the photos on Instagram.
[02:41:01.988 --> 02:41:03.908]  Stop with all the entertainment.
[02:41:03.908 --> 02:41:05.709]  21 Savage owns a bank.
[02:41:05.709 --> 02:41:12.091]  We have brilliant people that are inside of... By the way, I want to say the future, we're very close with some folks to actually having a bank.
[02:41:12.091 --> 02:41:13.292]  It's funny you bring that up.
[02:41:13.292 --> 02:41:15.092]  A bank and internet processing for patrons.
[02:41:15.092 --> 02:41:16.173]  That's the future.
[02:41:16.173 --> 02:41:18.373]  Is not trying to fix Twitter or fix any of it.
[02:41:18.373 --> 02:41:19.794]  Building our own system.
[02:41:20.134 --> 02:41:27.838]  I mean, the future is the past also, because as soon as you got the internet, all these things, the data can be copied by China, by these banks.
[02:41:27.838 --> 02:41:29.618]  Yeah, you don't really own your data, but it's on the cloud.
[02:41:29.618 --> 02:41:31.079]  So this is the last question.
[02:41:31.079 --> 02:41:32.180]  I know Louis Farrakhan.
[02:41:32.180 --> 02:41:33.200]  I've interviewed him.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:34.541]  I agree with like 95% of what he says.
[02:41:34.541 --> 02:41:35.301]  Some things I don't agree with.
[02:41:35.301 --> 02:41:37.342]  But the point is, I think he cares about people.
[02:41:37.342 --> 02:41:41.024]  He's a real guy, and he's nothing compared to the left saying all whites are devils and criminals.
[02:41:41.024 --> 02:41:42.785]  So they're way more racist than he is.
[02:41:44.065 --> 02:41:46.166]  You know, what he's been saying.
[02:41:46.166 --> 02:41:49.968]  You kind of got mad at him and said, hey, don't disrespect me with my billions they just stole.
[02:41:49.968 --> 02:41:51.508]  Because he said, hey, maybe it was never yours.
[02:41:51.508 --> 02:41:53.229]  I think his point is what you just made.
[02:41:53.229 --> 02:41:55.690]  If they can grab it out of your account, it's never yours.
[02:41:55.690 --> 02:41:58.551]  Unless it's your farm, your people, your kids, your thing, it's not yours.
[02:41:58.551 --> 02:42:00.312]  I don't think he was dissing your success.
[02:42:00.312 --> 02:42:02.633]  I think he was saying, was it ever yours to begin with?
[02:42:02.633 --> 02:42:03.493]  They can take it.
[02:42:03.493 --> 02:42:04.594]  Our life is not ours.
[02:42:04.594 --> 02:42:05.394]  It's God's.
[02:42:05.394 --> 02:42:06.975]  So now you get what he was saying.
[02:42:06.975 --> 02:42:08.575]  I talked to, I talked to the minister.
[02:42:08.575 --> 02:42:09.736]  Oh good, so you're not mad at him now?
[02:42:10.356 --> 02:42:11.437]  I'm not mad at anyone.
[02:42:11.437 --> 02:42:13.218]  I'm not mad at Ari Emanuel.
[02:42:13.218 --> 02:42:14.979]  If it's not off record, tell us about the conversation.
[02:42:14.979 --> 02:42:25.445]  On record, Ari Emanuel, if you need me and your wife to step into a private room and have me work on her clothing line, I'm here.
[02:42:25.445 --> 02:42:27.807]  But seriously, so you were a little mad at Farrakhan.
[02:42:27.807 --> 02:42:28.387]  You had a talk.
[02:42:28.387 --> 02:42:29.187]  How did that go?
[02:42:29.187 --> 02:42:30.969]  It's gonna be all Christian, Ari.
[02:42:30.969 --> 02:42:32.890]  Rom, Rom, Rom.
[02:42:32.890 --> 02:42:33.690]  Don't worry.
[02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:34.951]  It's gonna be all Christian, Rom.
[02:42:36.684 --> 02:42:37.984]  You are something else.
[02:42:37.984 --> 02:42:41.766]  Look, you look really friendly and nice, but with that mask, you look evil as hell.
[02:42:41.766 --> 02:42:43.146]  Let me just say this in closing.
[02:42:43.146 --> 02:42:43.986]  I've done a lot of study.
[02:42:43.986 --> 02:42:46.607]  I think Hitler was a really bad guy, and I repudiate what Hitler did.
[02:42:46.607 --> 02:42:49.668]  I understand that the British intelligence set him up and used him.
[02:42:49.668 --> 02:42:50.829]  I like Hitler.
[02:42:50.829 --> 02:42:51.409]  I don't like Hitler.
[02:42:52.008 --> 02:42:53.469]  I know you're trying to be shocking with that.
[02:42:53.469 --> 02:42:55.090]  I'm not trying to be shocking.
[02:42:55.090 --> 02:42:57.132]  I like Hitler.
[02:42:57.132 --> 02:42:59.914]  The Holocaust is not what happened.
[02:42:59.914 --> 02:43:01.275]  Let's look at the facts of that.
[02:43:01.275 --> 02:43:03.356]  And Hitler has a lot of redeeming qualities.
[02:43:03.356 --> 02:43:08.820]  So tell us, you think Hitler was the good guy in World War II?
[02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:12.123]  I think God says man should not kill.
[02:43:12.123 --> 02:43:13.243]  We should not have wars.
[02:43:13.243 --> 02:43:13.724]  Period.
[02:43:14.763 --> 02:43:16.163]  None of us should be killing anybody.
[02:43:16.163 --> 02:43:20.325]  Ukraine and the streets of Chicago, all violence should stop.
[02:43:20.325 --> 02:43:21.765]  And we should all serve Christ.
[02:43:21.765 --> 02:43:23.285]  That's what I feel.
[02:43:23.285 --> 02:43:26.586]  And I feel like I love everyone accordingly.
[02:43:26.586 --> 02:43:32.268]  From all the way from the Balenciagas to the Hitlers... Well, let me tell you a story.
[02:43:32.268 --> 02:43:33.288]  Hold on, sir.
[02:43:33.288 --> 02:43:37.009]  To Ari Emanuel to Jamie Dimon to the people who...
[02:43:38.766 --> 02:43:39.206]  Amber Alert.
[02:43:39.206 --> 02:43:40.387]  Here's what I'm saying.
[02:43:40.387 --> 02:43:43.649]  My grandfather would never tell World War II stories.
[02:43:43.649 --> 02:43:47.272]  And after he died, we read over his stuff and he never even told my dad all the stuff he did and everything.
[02:43:47.272 --> 02:43:48.953]  But it was all in their letters and commendations.
[02:43:48.953 --> 02:43:52.095]  He told me, he said, kid, I was like eight years old.
[02:43:52.095 --> 02:43:55.918]  I always saw Amber Alerts is when my ex-girlfriend Amber was doing something in the streets.
[02:43:55.918 --> 02:43:57.599]  Before he died, I was like five years old.
[02:43:57.599 --> 02:43:59.720]  The point was, and I was like, tell me a World War II story.
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:00.541]  Tell me a World War II story.
[02:44:01.061 --> 02:44:12.607]  He said, okay, well we came out of Africa, we came into Italy, he was there three years, he said by the time they got to Germany they went into this death camp and there were piles of dead bodies a hundred feet tall with black birds eating people's eyeballs out.
[02:44:12.607 --> 02:44:18.470]  All I'm telling you is, is that just because you hate the globalists and what they're doing, and I get it, Klaus Schwab's grandfather was a Nazi.
[02:44:18.470 --> 02:44:19.470]  I don't hate anybody.
[02:44:19.470 --> 02:44:22.532]  I think there's Nazis above the ADL.
[02:44:22.532 --> 02:44:24.353]  Yeah, but Nazis are like kind of cool.
[02:44:25.316 --> 02:44:26.858]  Because you like your uniforms?
[02:44:26.858 --> 02:44:28.840]  No, I just, these are people.
[02:44:28.840 --> 02:44:29.581]  Every month of the year.
[02:44:29.581 --> 02:44:30.462]  I love all people.
[02:44:30.462 --> 02:44:31.823]  So you love the Zionists?
[02:44:31.823 --> 02:44:32.344]  I love this.
[02:44:32.344 --> 02:44:33.485]  I said that earlier in the show.
[02:44:33.485 --> 02:44:34.046]  Alright.
[02:44:34.963 --> 02:44:37.924]  You have any comments on Hitler?
[02:44:37.924 --> 02:44:39.645]  Who did Ye say he hated?
[02:44:39.645 --> 02:44:41.085]  Ye didn't say he hated anybody.
[02:44:41.085 --> 02:44:42.966]  Why isn't anybody listening to him?
[02:44:42.966 --> 02:44:44.126]  He said, I love this person.
[02:44:44.126 --> 02:44:45.947]  I love the people who are trying to take away my children.
[02:44:45.947 --> 02:44:47.107]  I love this person.
[02:44:47.107 --> 02:44:48.288]  He never said he hated anybody.
[02:44:48.288 --> 02:44:51.729]  Listen, I'm just getting it totally clear.
[02:44:51.729 --> 02:44:53.510]  You did the same thing.
[02:44:53.510 --> 02:44:54.870]  Stalin is horrible.
[02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:55.851]  Hitler is horrible.
[02:44:55.851 --> 02:44:56.551]  Mao is horrible.
[02:44:56.551 --> 02:44:57.511]  No, no.
[02:44:57.511 --> 02:44:58.872]  I love all of those people.
[02:44:58.872 --> 02:44:59.452]  You love Mao Zedong?
[02:45:00.052 --> 02:45:02.053]  Absolutely!
[02:45:02.053 --> 02:45:02.613]  Clarify that.
[02:45:02.613 --> 02:45:03.814]  You're saying you're like Christ-like.
[02:45:03.814 --> 02:45:05.214]  You love everybody.
[02:45:05.214 --> 02:45:06.815]  You love Jim Jones.
[02:45:06.815 --> 02:45:08.496]  You love Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:45:08.496 --> 02:45:09.236]  Absolutely!
[02:45:09.236 --> 02:45:11.497]  Well, let's clarify.
[02:45:11.497 --> 02:45:14.358]  But he didn't need clarification because he said, I'm starting with the Bible.
[02:45:14.358 --> 02:45:16.579]  He's ending with the Bible.
[02:45:16.579 --> 02:45:19.301]  But they did it to you, Alex, because you had a guy who came here.
[02:45:19.301 --> 02:45:20.501]  You're like, I'll be Satan.
[02:45:20.501 --> 02:45:21.602]  I'll be the evil guy.
[02:45:21.602 --> 02:45:22.562]  I did Sandy Hook.
[02:45:22.562 --> 02:45:24.803]  Remember, you did the same thing that he's doing right now.
[02:45:24.803 --> 02:45:26.924]  All right.
[02:45:26.924 --> 02:45:27.204]  Absolutely.
[02:45:27.204 --> 02:45:28.605]  Yeah, we appreciate you.
[02:45:28.605 --> 02:45:29.365]  Anything else you want to add?
[02:45:30.137 --> 02:45:31.437]  Jesus is King.
[02:45:31.437 --> 02:45:33.578]  Start with the Bible.
[02:45:33.578 --> 02:45:34.678]  Love your children.
[02:45:34.678 --> 02:45:36.418]  Love your family.
[02:45:36.418 --> 02:45:39.639]  Think about the things that you're doing before you throw stones.
[02:45:39.639 --> 02:45:40.839]  Stop the trauma.
[02:45:40.839 --> 02:45:43.559]  Stop the generational abuse.
[02:45:43.559 --> 02:45:44.960]  The sexual abuse.
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:46.220]  What's next in the gay world?
[02:45:46.220 --> 02:45:47.700]  What are you going to do next?
[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:49.200]  Sir, I was still in the middle of it.
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:50.861]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:45:50.861 --> 02:45:52.641]  Stop the abuse.
[02:45:52.641 --> 02:45:55.621]  They say abuse goes three generations.
[02:45:55.621 --> 02:45:57.282]  Stop the trafficking.
[02:45:57.282 --> 02:45:59.302]  Instagram is sex trafficking.
[02:46:00.243 --> 02:46:03.105]  The language, I'm gonna screw your wife.
[02:46:03.105 --> 02:46:05.287]  I'm gonna have all that is trafficking.
[02:46:05.287 --> 02:46:05.967]  Stop it.
[02:46:05.967 --> 02:46:08.890]  Stop the drug usage.
[02:46:08.890 --> 02:46:09.671]  Stop the killing.
[02:46:09.671 --> 02:46:11.072]  We put the guns down ourselves.
[02:46:11.072 --> 02:46:14.615]  We rise up and we show God how strong we are.
[02:46:14.615 --> 02:46:18.438]  It's our disobedience to God that got us enslaved.
[02:46:18.438 --> 02:46:21.621]  God is on our side, but we have to be on God's side.
[02:46:21.621 --> 02:46:23.062]  We have to listen to our Father.
[02:46:23.743 --> 02:46:27.725]  We have to listen to God and follow Him, and He will protect us.
[02:46:27.725 --> 02:46:29.006]  Now, I agree with that.
[02:46:29.006 --> 02:46:34.530]  Before we can cast stones, you're saying you love everybody, you don't judge them, it's God to judge.
[02:46:34.530 --> 02:46:35.670]  I agree with that statement.
[02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:38.792]  And we've got to change ourselves and stop pointing our fingers at somebody else.
[02:46:38.792 --> 02:46:40.133]  Exactly.
[02:46:40.133 --> 02:46:45.116]  And it's to say, hey, I'm going to show you how much Jewish media can't tell me what to say.
[02:46:46.144 --> 02:46:47.305]  You like that, Ari?
[02:46:47.305 --> 02:46:50.147]  And I'm telling you, we could get a nice private room.
[02:46:50.147 --> 02:46:52.829]  Me and your wife can go in and work on the clothing line.
[02:46:52.829 --> 02:46:55.431]  I'm really good at it, and it'll be super Christian.
[02:46:55.431 --> 02:46:58.553]  Hey, Ron, it's okay.
[02:46:58.553 --> 02:47:00.454]  You gotta thank for his wife?
[02:47:00.454 --> 02:47:01.595]  Absolutely not!
[02:47:01.595 --> 02:47:07.880]  I would not look at his wife for a second, but I do believe that the clothing line could use some creative improvement.
[02:47:09.542 --> 02:47:11.263]  Alright, InfoWars.com.
[02:47:11.263 --> 02:47:13.324]  Tomorrow's news today, Nick Fuentes.
[02:47:13.324 --> 02:47:14.104]  Yay!
[02:47:14.104 --> 02:47:16.966]  I don't want to end this if you've got more to say, but you've got to catch a flight.
[02:47:16.966 --> 02:47:17.606]  Gotta catch a flight.
[02:47:17.606 --> 02:47:18.447]  Alright, yay!
[02:47:18.447 --> 02:47:21.148]  I appreciate you coming and I appreciate the First Amendment.
[02:47:21.148 --> 02:47:22.589]  And look, he's not taking the mask off.
[02:47:22.589 --> 02:47:23.669]  Yay was not here.
[02:47:23.669 --> 02:47:24.890]  Incredible impersonator.
[02:47:24.890 --> 02:47:27.091]  Wilbert Johnson was the impersonator.
[02:47:27.091 --> 02:47:29.953]  Wilbert... Net... Net... Netton was here, though.
[02:47:29.953 --> 02:47:32.274]  Actually, Benjamin Netanyahu played Kanye West today.
[02:47:33.601 --> 02:47:35.442]  Hey Nathan, what you at?
[02:47:35.442 --> 02:47:36.602]  Hey, yay!
[02:47:36.602 --> 02:47:38.603]  Guys, here are the Justin Trudeau thing and some clips.
[02:47:38.603 --> 02:47:41.224]  We're going to come right back and talk to Owen and the rest of the crew.
[02:47:41.224 --> 02:47:41.884]  Owen, get in here.
[02:47:41.884 --> 02:47:44.565]  Do the last siren with Nathan Yahoo.
[02:47:44.565 --> 02:47:46.466]  Alright, this has been incredible.
[02:47:46.466 --> 02:47:47.446]  Folks, free shipping.

[02:47:52.108 --> 02:47:52.588]  I'll be back.

[02:47:56.229 --> 02:47:57.990]  First member of the SAC was saying, you just saw it.
[02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:59.310]  It's good to have these debates.
[02:47:59.310 --> 02:48:00.791]  It's good to have these open discussions.
[02:48:00.791 --> 02:48:01.371]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:01.371 --> 02:48:01.731]  Stay with us.
[02:48:05.594 --> 02:48:05.714]  Oh.

[02:48:25.022 --> 02:48:26.103]  I got some bad news.
[02:48:26.103 --> 02:48:37.493]  I thought we had enough free gifts of books and films and t-shirts and DVDs and all the rest of it, with every order, to keep it going at least until early December.
