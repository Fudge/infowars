[00:00.000 --> 00:17.400]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:30.000 --> 00:59.240]  The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone capable of seeing
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.920]  past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[01:03.920 --> 01:24.800]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[01:24.800 --> 01:41.280]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[01:41.280 --> 01:44.240]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[01:44.240 --> 01:50.320]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines
[01:50.320 --> 01:55.440]  by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[01:55.440 --> 02:00.520]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side
[02:00.520 --> 02:07.560]  effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[02:07.560 --> 02:12.480]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[02:12.480 --> 02:18.680]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[02:18.680 --> 02:23.760]  These objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers
[02:23.760 --> 02:30.680]  and coroners, horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[02:30.680 --> 02:36.600]  These are not blood clots and they appear to be some sort of organic material with small
[02:36.600 --> 02:44.760]  crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[02:44.760 --> 02:50.400]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of
[02:50.400 --> 02:56.600]  the deadly side effects we are seeing today, what the mainstream media is currently spinning
[02:56.600 --> 03:00.920]  as sudden adult death syndrome.
[03:00.920 --> 03:05.960]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners
[03:05.960 --> 03:12.920]  everywhere, except pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out or they don't
[03:12.920 --> 03:14.120]  care.
[03:14.120 --> 03:20.880]  Everyone has shown the courage to speak out so far, and this is the real tragedy.
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.640]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[03:24.640 --> 03:31.160]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months
[03:31.160 --> 03:34.680]  old, and humanity does nothing.
[03:34.680 --> 03:39.000]  Today we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  are focused on.
[03:40.000 --> 03:45.960]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[03:45.960 --> 03:48.800]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[03:48.800 --> 03:50.480]  Well guys, here's some good news.
[03:50.480 --> 03:54.800]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.520]  five and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[03:58.520 --> 03:59.520]  That's great.
[03:59.520 --> 04:07.040]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I know that if you watch Infowars live every day, you've
[04:07.040 --> 04:14.480]  probably seen that report four or five times now, but it's extremely imperative and I've
[04:14.480 --> 04:18.480]  got all this other news to cover and it's important to remember what's been done to us
[04:18.480 --> 04:19.640]  with these vaccines.
[04:19.640 --> 04:21.320]  We can never forget it.
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.800]  We can never forget the lies of our government.
[04:24.800 --> 04:31.800]  We can never forget the lies of Anthony Fauci, the lies of the vaccine manufacturers, and
[04:31.800 --> 04:37.760]  just how evil what they've done is.
[04:37.760 --> 04:42.720]  And now not only do we have all the people getting the clots and dying and having the
[04:42.720 --> 04:51.320]  facial paralysis and the guion beret, they're having their immune systems reset.
[04:51.320 --> 05:01.200]  They don't even stop COVID and four times injected Fauci now supposedly has COVID-19.
[05:01.200 --> 05:06.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[05:06.200 --> 05:08.880]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[05:08.880 --> 05:14.720]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves
[05:14.720 --> 05:19.000]  and your families to the greatest extent possible and these two new sales do that.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.160]  We have the ultimate immune support 60% off when you get these four items together.
[05:24.160 --> 05:28.840]  The immune support, X2, D3 gummies, and multivitamin.
[05:28.840 --> 05:32.240]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[05:32.240 --> 05:34.560]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[05:34.560 --> 05:35.560]  60% off.
[05:35.560 --> 05:41.880]  Then the Trafecta immune support 50% off on immune support X2 and D3 gummies.

[06:25.840 --> 06:37.400]  We are live on this Thursday, June 16, 2022.
[06:37.400 --> 06:45.160]  The Alex Jones show info wars lives on despite the largest criminal group in world history
[06:45.160 --> 06:48.040]  trying to destroy us.
[06:48.040 --> 06:55.120]  What an epic thing to be a part of and we're all in this together ladies and gentlemen.
[06:55.120 --> 07:02.080]  All right, I have an absolutely loaded news desk today.
[07:02.080 --> 07:04.480]  Let me tell you everything we've got.
[07:04.480 --> 07:08.480]  It's going to be a heavy news broadcast.
[07:08.480 --> 07:13.920]  We've got the left, the Democrats, the liberals.
[07:13.920 --> 07:19.160]  At this point, is it fair to say they've gone full pedophilia or I guess as they would
[07:19.160 --> 07:26.600]  prefer you call it minor attracted persons because you now have attorney general saying
[07:26.600 --> 07:28.520]  we need more drag queens.
[07:28.520 --> 07:32.400]  We need a drag queen in every school every day.
[07:32.400 --> 07:33.920]  Wow.
[07:33.920 --> 07:34.920]  Why?
[07:34.920 --> 07:35.920]  Why?
[07:35.920 --> 07:37.960]  What about a stripper?
[07:37.960 --> 07:43.800]  Yeah, as there's multiple investigations underway because these drag queens who are
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.920]  just men pretending to be female strippers.
[07:48.920 --> 07:49.920]  That's what it is.
[07:49.920 --> 07:56.880]  It's men pretending to be female strippers for children and their genitals are on display.
[07:56.880 --> 07:59.480]  They're genitals.
[07:59.480 --> 08:01.480]  That's a crime.
[08:01.480 --> 08:02.480]  That's a crime.
[08:02.480 --> 08:04.800]  Plus against minors, you're on sexual watch list.
[08:04.800 --> 08:05.800]  You're now a predator.
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.800]  Oh, but it's liberal.
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.640]  Oh, it's Pride Month.
[08:09.640 --> 08:11.040]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[08:11.040 --> 08:12.400]  I forgot.
[08:12.400 --> 08:16.840]  Sexual crimes against children are now okay as long as you're a liberal or it's Pride
[08:16.840 --> 08:17.840]  Month.
[08:17.840 --> 08:18.840]  Then it's all good.
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  You're liberal, liberal.
[08:19.840 --> 08:21.240]  And then you show the kids your genitals.
[08:21.240 --> 08:27.040]  Pride Month, Pride Month, Pride Month, here's my genitals, kids.
[08:27.040 --> 08:28.040]  So that's what's going on now.
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.280]  So is it fair?
[08:30.280 --> 08:35.840]  Well we'll find out because Republicans are putting Democrats in a position now where
[08:35.840 --> 08:40.880]  they either have to come out and say, yep, we affirm minor attracted persons or they're
[08:40.880 --> 08:47.400]  going to have to back off all the sexual deviancy they've been promoting and engaging in.
[08:47.400 --> 08:52.240]  I then have a stack of economic news and it's not good.
[08:52.240 --> 08:53.240]  How could it be?
[08:53.240 --> 08:55.880]  Biden is in the White House.
[08:55.880 --> 09:02.240]  Democrats are in control and their plan was always to wreck this country.
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.280]  Biden campaigned in front of tens of people saying how he was going to shut down the energy
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.600]  sector and he's done things to shut down the energy sector.
[09:11.600 --> 09:21.960]  But last month, just last month, honestly, the ability for Joe Biden to lie, I mean,
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.160]  it's tough to even say if he knows what's going on.
[09:25.160 --> 09:32.640]  Last month Joe Biden canceled two oil pipeline leases.
[09:32.640 --> 09:33.640]  I forget the exact story.
[09:33.640 --> 09:34.640]  He canceled two of them.
[09:34.640 --> 09:35.720]  They had permits.
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.400]  He canceled them, so less oil being produced.
[09:40.400 --> 09:46.400]  And then the next day he goes out and makes a speech saying he's doing everything he
[09:46.400 --> 09:54.080]  can to lower the prices the day after he canceled a pipeline lease.
[09:54.080 --> 10:02.720]  So imagine he goes, Joe Biden goes into the electrical room and turns off all the switches.
[10:02.720 --> 10:04.880]  So no, actually, no, no, no, let's be more accurate.
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.840]  Joe Biden runs around town saying, I'm going to turn off the electricity and he goes around
[10:10.840 --> 10:14.480]  telling everybody how he's going to turn off the electricity and how good it is.
[10:14.480 --> 10:15.480]  Okay.
[10:15.480 --> 10:22.160]  Then he goes to the electrical room and actually turns all the switches off just and he's just
[10:22.160 --> 10:25.320]  down there just turning every switch off.
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.560]  And then the next day he goes on TV and he says, I'm going to do everything I can to
[10:28.560 --> 10:31.920]  put those switches on.
[10:31.920 --> 10:34.960]  And you say, I just watched you turn them all off, you told me you were going to turn
[10:34.960 --> 10:35.960]  them all off, you did it.
[10:35.960 --> 10:38.080]  What do you mean now you're telling me you're going to turn them all on and that makes you
[10:38.080 --> 10:39.080]  a hero?
[10:39.080 --> 10:40.080]  How what?
[10:40.080 --> 10:43.680]  That's the level of lying.
[10:43.680 --> 10:45.360]  That's the level of deceit.
[10:45.360 --> 10:46.680]  What a scumbag.
[10:46.680 --> 10:55.120]  And then what absolute morons or scumbags would ever support this liar, this criminal?
[10:55.120 --> 11:00.520]  But okay, we've got that economic news coming up.
[11:00.520 --> 11:06.400]  Liberals falling for fake news again, desperately, hopelessly trying to destroy the Republicans
[11:06.400 --> 11:08.440]  that are actually pushing back against them.
[11:08.440 --> 11:12.360]  Not the cucks like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, but I mean real American patriots
[11:12.360 --> 11:14.400]  like Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar and others.
[11:14.400 --> 11:17.680]  Oh, they fall for fake news every time.
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.920]  And there's kind of a little sub story there that others aren't really seeing.
[11:21.920 --> 11:24.440]  It's not, well, we'll cover that.
[11:24.440 --> 11:25.440]  It's nothing new.
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.440]  Liberals falling for fake news.
[11:26.440 --> 11:27.440]  It's what they do.
[11:27.440 --> 11:32.120]  Oh, and also domestic terrorism, that's another thing they do.
[11:32.120 --> 11:39.840]  Domestic terrorism and the group, Jane's Revenge and the group Shutdown DC are both marching
[11:39.840 --> 11:41.760]  around DC every day.
[11:41.760 --> 11:45.880]  They have lawyers on call, they have bail bondsmen's on call.
[11:45.880 --> 11:49.520]  They're anticipating the rover's way decision to come down, in which case they're going
[11:49.520 --> 11:55.000]  to start burning churches, burning pregnancy centers, burning buildings in DC, and they've
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.480]  written manifestos on how they're going to do this.
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.800]  They've published the addresses of pregnancy centers.
[12:04.800 --> 12:07.640]  They've published the addresses of the Supreme Court justices.
[12:07.640 --> 12:13.440]  They've published the addresses of the Supreme Court justices, children, all of this publicly
[12:13.440 --> 12:19.640]  done, not a word from the FBI, not a word from Department of Homeland Security, not
[12:19.640 --> 12:22.240]  a word from the Biden administration.
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.800]  In fact, I take that back, there has been a word from the Biden administration.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.160]  They're encouraging it.
[12:29.160 --> 12:31.960]  They're encouraging it.
[12:31.960 --> 12:37.360]  So how dare the largest domestic terror group in the history of this country, the Democrat
[12:37.360 --> 12:41.680]  Party, wave fingers and point fingers at Donald Trump and his voters.
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.200]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of murdering babies.
[12:46.200 --> 12:50.080]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of domestic terrorism.
[12:50.080 --> 12:58.080]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of shut off our oil.
[12:58.080 --> 13:01.840]  Then we've got developments, geopolitical developments.
[13:01.840 --> 13:08.240]  The situation in Ukraine is getting worse for Biden and Zelensky, except for the fact
[13:08.240 --> 13:10.560]  they're stealing billions of dollars.
[13:10.560 --> 13:11.640]  So that's good for them.
[13:11.640 --> 13:15.880]  They're stealing billions of dollars, but they're losing Ukraine.
[13:15.880 --> 13:18.880]  They're losing the hearts and minds of people around the world.
[13:18.880 --> 13:20.880]  They're losing the support of Europe.
[13:20.880 --> 13:22.640]  They're losing really of everyone.
[13:22.640 --> 13:25.080]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry.
[13:25.080 --> 13:36.520]  I really am sorry that our media and our politicians are such lying scumbags that won't tell you
[13:36.520 --> 13:38.360]  the truth about what's going on in Ukraine.
[13:38.360 --> 13:40.040]  I'm sorry.
[13:40.040 --> 13:43.880]  And I'm sorry that you have to tune into Info Wars and I don't know if anywhere else is
[13:43.880 --> 13:47.920]  really even telling you the truth about what's going on in Ukraine as far as the size of
[13:47.920 --> 13:48.920]  our audience here.
[13:48.920 --> 13:52.120]  I mean, there's a lot of other independent journalists, like one in Germany who's been,
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.920]  I believe, arrested now.
[13:53.920 --> 13:59.040]  Oh, no, no, no, that's right, she's had her bank account frozen, they'll probably arrest
[13:59.040 --> 14:00.040]  her next.
[14:00.040 --> 14:06.000]  Folks, Russia is doing whatever it wants in Ukraine.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.400]  It's had like a tiny amount of resistance, I guess you could call it resistance.
[14:12.400 --> 14:16.480]  They've had a small amount of resistance to which they could have just wiped out entirely,
[14:16.480 --> 14:18.280]  but they were patient about it.
[14:18.280 --> 14:21.520]  And Russia is doing pretty much whatever it wants in Ukraine.
[14:21.520 --> 14:26.680]  And European countries are saying we don't want to fight Biden's war.
[14:26.680 --> 14:32.720]  And the rest of the power structures of the planet geopolitically is siding with Russia
[14:32.720 --> 14:34.120]  now.
[14:34.120 --> 14:41.520]  So you've got the NATO and EU allies of the U.S. all basically saying we don't want anything
[14:41.520 --> 14:43.080]  to do with Biden's war in Ukraine.
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.520]  We want nothing to do with this.
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.280]  When you have all the other countries that are at the top of the power structure in the
[14:49.280 --> 14:51.680]  world, they're all siding with Russia.
[14:51.680 --> 14:55.960]  So I'm sorry your media and your politicians aren't telling you this.
[14:55.960 --> 14:58.200]  I don't even know how to properly explain it.
[14:58.200 --> 15:00.600]  I mean, isolationism, maybe?
[15:00.600 --> 15:02.840]  You know, they all said Trump would isolate us from the planet.
[15:02.840 --> 15:03.840]  Folks, that's Biden.
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.640]  You know, the Saudi Arabians don't even want to talk to Joe Biden.
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.640]  They don't even want to talk to him.
[15:10.640 --> 15:16.000]  They ignore his phone calls.
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.640]  Whenever the White House reaches out to European countries, they roll their eyes.
[15:18.640 --> 15:19.640]  They don't want to deal with this.
[15:19.640 --> 15:23.200]  They don't want to deal with this garbage administration.
[15:23.200 --> 15:26.840]  So I'm sorry that you've been lied to about everything in Ukraine.
[15:26.840 --> 15:33.280]  It's been a disaster for the U.S., actually, more than anybody, aside from Ukraine, perhaps.
[15:33.280 --> 15:34.280]  So we've got that.
[15:34.280 --> 15:40.080]  I've got a whole stack of COVID and vaccine news here that's got important developments.
[15:40.080 --> 15:42.080]  We've got some election news.
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.800]  Democrats continue to try to come after your firearms.

[18:04.320 --> 18:09.000]  rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done
[18:09.000 --> 18:10.000]  these profiles.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  You see it every year.
[18:11.000 --> 18:16.040]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers,
[18:16.040 --> 18:21.840]  and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.840 --> 18:25.240]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding
[18:25.240 --> 18:26.240]  this and knowing this.
[18:26.240 --> 18:31.840]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[18:31.840 --> 18:34.880]  to be able to do things tax wise.
[18:34.880 --> 18:37.400]  It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more of your money.
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.840]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.

[19:04.240 --> 19:05.240]  Granny Do Right.
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.240]  Granny Do Right.
[19:06.240 --> 19:07.240]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[19:07.240 --> 19:08.240]  Go ahead.
[19:08.240 --> 19:14.160]  First of all, let me say I love your products, I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens
[19:14.160 --> 19:19.000]  out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots
[19:19.000 --> 19:21.640]  or age spots as they're lovingly called.
[19:21.640 --> 19:27.640]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous actually.
[19:27.640 --> 19:30.960]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[19:30.960 --> 19:35.040]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[19:35.040 --> 19:39.280]  what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[19:39.280 --> 19:44.240]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but you know, over a period of time, I started
[19:44.240 --> 19:49.360]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[19:49.360 --> 19:55.680]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[19:55.680 --> 20:00.800]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[20:00.800 --> 20:07.800]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:43.740 --> 20:47.520]  what one commentator called this week, a bunch of high IQ, stupid people.
[20:47.520 --> 20:51.640]  No lords that were well educated, but no common sense.
[20:51.640 --> 20:55.120]  President Biden has appointed white jobs.
[20:55.120 --> 21:00.400]  I mean, it's like these people dropped acid in an outback parking lot.
[21:00.400 --> 21:07.080]  You can't reason with them that they are just so awoke, so woke and that's the difference
[21:07.080 --> 21:11.920]  in my opinion and why they haven't course corrected.
[21:11.920 --> 21:17.800]  Senator John Kennedy telling it like it is on Fox News last night, yeah, I mean, they
[21:17.800 --> 21:26.520]  are whack jobs and it's like a weird woke topia whack job fest happening in the White
[21:26.520 --> 21:27.520]  House.
[21:27.520 --> 21:28.520]  Hey, look, oh, this person's gay.
[21:28.520 --> 21:29.520]  Hey, this person's black.
[21:29.520 --> 21:31.560]  Hey, this person's a puppy kink.
[21:31.560 --> 21:35.520]  Hey, you know, hey, this person's a man that thinks he's a woman.
[21:35.520 --> 21:36.920]  Oh, right.
[21:36.920 --> 21:38.640]  It's a clown show.
[21:38.640 --> 21:40.840]  It's a circus.
[21:40.840 --> 21:42.240]  The kids are running the school.
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.440]  The kids are driving the bus.
[21:44.440 --> 21:46.000]  The insane people are running the asylum.
[21:46.000 --> 21:49.080]  I mean, pick your analogy.
[21:49.080 --> 21:50.240]  That's what's going on.
[21:50.240 --> 21:53.800]  So of course, America is falling apart at the seams.
[21:53.800 --> 21:56.760]  Of course, the economy is an absolute disaster right now.
[21:56.760 --> 22:04.000]  By the way, I said largest Fed rate hike since 74 yesterday, it's 94.
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  Here's the Fed statement on the biggest interest rate hike since 1994.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.880]  So yeah, the statement is Biden is crushing your economy.
[22:14.880 --> 22:16.520]  What do you want us to do?
[22:16.520 --> 22:21.280]  Food stamps, credit card debt, record high inflation forces some older Americans to make
[22:21.280 --> 22:23.240]  tough financial choices.
[22:23.240 --> 22:29.000]  Yeah, that access, that ease of access, that abundance, that excess, it's all gone now
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.320]  and it's all by design.
[22:31.320 --> 22:35.200]  It's all by design.
[22:35.200 --> 22:39.160]  America must be brought to heel and Biden is doing just that and the whole world is
[22:39.160 --> 22:48.280]  watching in amazement, in amazement and they don't know what to do because this is going
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.640]  to cost them in the midterms.
[22:49.640 --> 22:54.840]  The only chance the Democrats really have is just a bigger theft in 2020, which will
[22:54.840 --> 23:00.480]  be so obvious that I don't know how they'll pull that off.
[23:00.480 --> 23:04.000]  But these are desperate criminals we're talking about here.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.480]  So I wouldn't put it past them.
[23:09.480 --> 23:15.680]  I wouldn't put it past them as Biden screams into microphones yelling at Vladimir Putin.
[23:15.680 --> 23:20.560]  It's like Putin has raised our gas, Putin has done this, Putin has crashed our economy.
[23:20.560 --> 23:22.320]  Oh, really?
[23:22.320 --> 23:24.440]  I woke up this morning, had a bit of a stomach ache.
[23:24.440 --> 23:33.520]  Dang it, Putin, that darn Russian, man, oh man, yard was a mess, windstorm came through,
[23:33.520 --> 23:36.760]  blew all these trees down, man, fricking Putin, man.
[23:36.760 --> 23:43.560]  No, it's Biden, it's the Democrats, they campaigned on this.
[23:43.560 --> 23:46.280]  They call it a transition and then they deny it.
[23:46.280 --> 23:50.480]  They say this is going to be a tough transition period, we're shutting off your energy, we're
[23:50.480 --> 23:52.480]  transitioning into the new world.
[23:52.480 --> 23:54.080]  Okay, what's the transition?
[23:54.080 --> 23:56.400]  Well, you're going to have your country collapse.
[23:56.400 --> 23:58.440]  Hey, I don't like this transition much.
[23:58.440 --> 23:59.440]  What transition?
[23:59.440 --> 24:02.360]  It's Putin's fault.
[24:02.360 --> 24:07.780]  Despite ongoing energy crisis and record fuel prices every day, leftist activists sue Biden
[24:07.780 --> 24:12.840]  administration to block 3,500 oil and gas permits.
[24:12.840 --> 24:16.040]  They love shutting down our energy.
[24:16.040 --> 24:24.680]  But hey, I mean, lazy bum liberals, lazy bums who don't have a job, don't have a family
[24:24.680 --> 24:29.840]  and don't really care if they can have cheap gas or not because they're, you know, flying
[24:29.840 --> 24:36.680]  around with bongo drums, hanging out in trees, playing the bongos, yeah, they don't care
[24:36.680 --> 24:41.320]  about gas prices going up, but you, the guy and the girl that works and has a family and
[24:41.320 --> 24:44.720]  needs to take your kids to school and maybe drives 30 miles to work.
[24:44.720 --> 24:51.640]  Yeah, you care, but not the bum liberal that is begging to increase energy prices by shutting
[24:51.640 --> 24:54.800]  off all of our gas permits.
[24:54.800 --> 24:58.680]  And again, I just, guys, this is kind of bothering me.
[24:58.680 --> 24:59.680]  See if you can find it.
[24:59.680 --> 25:05.280]  It was, it was May 12th associated press headline, something about Biden cancelling
[25:05.280 --> 25:06.280]  oil leases.
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.280]  See if you can find this.
[25:07.280 --> 25:08.280]  It's just sitting in my head.
[25:08.280 --> 25:16.160]  I don't remember it, but Biden cancels oil deals, okay?
[25:16.160 --> 25:21.440]  That would bring more oil into the company, into the country, lower oil prices, give us
[25:21.440 --> 25:23.120]  some more access.
[25:23.120 --> 25:25.200]  Thank you guys so much.
[25:25.200 --> 25:26.840]  Crew has my back.
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.480]  Biden cancels offshore oil lease sales in Gulf Coast and Alaska.
[25:31.480 --> 25:33.520]  So that was May 12th, 2022.
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.320]  Next month, Biden cancels offshore oil lease sales in Gulf Coast, Alaska.
[25:38.320 --> 25:42.000]  So he's canceled, he's canceled hundreds of these deals.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.200]  These liberal activists want them to cancel the rest.
[25:45.200 --> 25:48.960]  So you'll literally have no gas coming in, $10 a gallon.
[25:48.960 --> 25:49.960]  Screw that.
[25:49.960 --> 25:56.800]  You're talking 30, 40, $50 a gallon if they do this.
[25:56.800 --> 26:02.600]  So Biden shuts off all the oil deals, shuts off all the pipelines, and then, and then the
[26:02.600 --> 26:08.560]  next day goes on TV and says, I'm doing everything I can to lower your gas prices, a complete
[26:08.560 --> 26:10.880]  lie to your face.
[26:10.880 --> 26:12.440]  He might as well spit in your face.
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.880]  He might as well piss in your face and call it rain.
[26:16.880 --> 26:25.280]  And then to buy Europe's silence in this disaster, he gives Europe our strategic oil reserves.
[26:25.280 --> 26:28.520]  That's what's going on here, folks.
[26:28.520 --> 26:32.840]  They say, hey, we're going to, we're going to release the strategic oil reserves to lower
[26:32.840 --> 26:34.080]  your gas prices.
[26:34.080 --> 26:36.080]  It never happened.
[26:36.080 --> 26:41.360]  They have released more than half our strategic oil reserves, and half of that, if not more,
[26:41.360 --> 26:43.440]  have gone to Europe.
[26:43.440 --> 26:47.920]  You say, well, why would he be sending our oil reserves to Europe?
[26:47.920 --> 26:53.760]  Because Biden's war in Ukraine has, has been a disaster for Europe, too.
[26:53.760 --> 26:57.800]  Putin hasn't doubled the gas prices in Europe, Biden has.
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.280]  So what does Biden do to buy the silence from European leaders, to buy their loyalty?
[27:02.280 --> 27:04.640]  Hey, you guys, don't blame me for this.
[27:04.640 --> 27:05.640]  Blame Putin.
[27:05.640 --> 27:06.640]  Well, what are you going to do for us?
[27:06.640 --> 27:09.720]  I'll give you our strategic oil reserves.
[27:09.720 --> 27:12.720]  And that's what Biden has done.
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.920]  And then he goes on TV and tells you he's doing everything possible to lower your gas prices
[27:16.920 --> 27:21.360]  when the exact opposite is the reality.
[27:21.360 --> 27:25.440]  Fuel thefts on the rise as Biden gas prices continue to hit all-time record highs.
[27:25.440 --> 27:29.960]  Yeah, people siphoning fuel out of cars, it's a new thing, or drilling holes into the bottom
[27:29.960 --> 27:33.880]  of your gas tank so they can leak it out into their gas can.
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.840]  Only in Biden's America, a third-world hellhole, run by Democrats, Abbott's baby formula plant
[27:38.840 --> 27:42.480]  in Sturgis, Michigan closed again, this time due to weather damage.
[27:42.480 --> 27:44.080]  So a legitimate closing this time.
[27:44.080 --> 27:47.560]  Too bad they illegitimately shut it down, and now there's a baby formula shortage.
[27:47.560 --> 27:48.560]  It's Democrats.
[27:48.560 --> 27:49.560]  That's what they do.
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.200]  Biden Energy Secretary tells Americans to stop complaining, because Brazilians have
[27:54.200 --> 27:55.920]  to pay the same amount for gas.
[27:55.920 --> 27:56.920]  Oh, I see.
[27:56.920 --> 28:00.280]  Well, hey, liberals, stop complaining about gun violence.
[28:00.280 --> 28:02.240]  It's worse in Mexico and Brazil.
[28:02.240 --> 28:03.840]  Stop complaining, liberals.
[28:03.840 --> 28:05.400]  So much worse in other countries.
[28:05.400 --> 28:06.560]  Stop complaining, Libs.
[28:06.560 --> 28:08.280]  Stop complaining, Dems, about gun crimes.
[28:08.280 --> 28:10.200]  It's worse in Brazil.
[28:10.200 --> 28:12.760]  White House demands oil companies be patriots.
[28:12.760 --> 28:13.760]  Produce more gas.
[28:13.760 --> 28:15.920]  Can you imagine how ticked off these oil companies are?
[28:15.920 --> 28:21.560]  By the way, who knows what's really going on, but in 2020 and 2021, the oil companies
[28:21.560 --> 28:25.360]  claimed to have lost money.
[28:25.360 --> 28:28.480]  In 2020 and 2021, oil companies claimed to have lost money.
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.960]  And then because the pandemic and then Biden canceled all these deals that they had basically
[28:33.960 --> 28:37.800]  planned out financially, economically for the oil companies for decades, and Biden canceled
[28:37.800 --> 28:38.800]  all of it.
[28:38.800 --> 28:40.920]  They ended up taking a loss.
[28:40.920 --> 28:44.000]  Biden threatens U.S. oil companies with the use of emergency authorities.
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  Can you imagine being an oil company and Biden is doing everything to crush your business?
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.720]  And then he turns around and points the finger at you.
[28:51.720 --> 28:55.200]  Yeah, everybody knows Joe Biden's a scumbag.
[28:55.200 --> 28:59.880]  Only liars pretend he's not.
[28:59.880 --> 29:05.520]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[29:05.520 --> 29:07.040]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[29:07.040 --> 29:11.200]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming.
[29:11.200 --> 29:12.920]  I tried to stop it.
[29:12.920 --> 29:17.960]  And now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[29:17.960 --> 29:23.120]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[29:23.120 --> 29:24.800]  It's now out in the open.
[29:24.800 --> 29:30.520]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[29:30.520 --> 29:31.520]  Group.
[29:31.520 --> 29:34.320]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.480]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[29:37.480 --> 29:38.480]  We're going to win this thing.
[29:38.480 --> 29:40.360]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[29:40.360 --> 29:44.160]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.840]  your financial support because without you, info wars would not be here.

[29:58.800 --> 29:59.800]  your efforts.
[29:59.800 --> 30:04.360]  The National Decisors' new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern
[30:04.360 --> 30:09.160]  times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[30:09.160 --> 30:13.360]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[30:13.360 --> 30:17.200]  Now, it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch it online, but you
[30:17.200 --> 30:23.160]  need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't
[30:23.160 --> 30:27.320]  be censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.

[31:01.040 --> 31:06.360]  I'm a humble person and I want to say that I'm just a man, but I'm not just a man.
[31:06.360 --> 31:10.760]  It's just like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, you
[31:10.760 --> 31:15.400]  were made by the creator of the universe, who had a plan for you, who has a destiny
[31:15.400 --> 31:16.400]  for you.
[31:16.400 --> 31:20.280]  That's why the system hates you and fears you and that's why they hate me.
[31:20.280 --> 31:25.320]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and
[31:25.320 --> 31:27.320]  will and love.
[31:27.320 --> 31:32.280]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[31:32.280 --> 31:37.600]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person,
[31:37.600 --> 31:41.800]  because you love God and God loves you and so I signed up for this.
[31:41.800 --> 31:46.880]  I signed up for this fight and I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer, but I can't fight this fight
[31:46.880 --> 31:50.560]  without you and that's why I want you always to remember that I appreciate you and I thank
[31:50.560 --> 31:55.480]  you because info wars is your fight, info wars is your baby, it's the thing you built.
[31:55.480 --> 31:58.160]  We did this together, so God bless you all.
[31:58.160 --> 31:59.160]  Let's keep fighting.
[31:59.160 --> 32:04.800]  A lot of listeners have told us it's hard to find out of the thousands of great items
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.400]  and info wars.com, all the storeable food, so we've made it easy with our great partners

[32:17.400 --> 32:21.960]  Go to preparetoday.com and protect yourself and your family with what's coming and what
[32:21.960 --> 32:24.480]  is already unfolding with level food shortages.
[32:24.480 --> 32:28.800]  I told you over two years ago, the global is going to have massive inflation and food
[32:28.800 --> 32:33.560]  shortages and it's happened just like clockwork and I'm telling you it's going to get a lot
[32:33.560 --> 32:35.680]  worse, they have designed this.
[32:35.680 --> 32:41.240]  The way to beat them is to buy food now before your dollar is even more devalued.
[32:41.240 --> 32:46.920]  We're ready to ship to you right now at preparetoday.com and not just storeable food, hundreds
[32:46.920 --> 32:52.120]  of the highest quality, survival and preparedness items in stock at low prices ready to ship

[33:01.120 --> 33:08.120]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:31.120 --> 33:39.200]  I'm not really surprised that no Democrats will endorse Joe Biden in 2024.
[33:39.200 --> 33:43.200]  Who would want to saddle up next to this disaster?
[33:43.200 --> 33:47.000]  People are leaving his administration left and right, Kamala Harris can't keep anybody
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.160]  in her office either.
[33:49.160 --> 33:53.640]  It's an absolute embarrassment, it's an absolute disaster and as much as the media tries to
[33:53.640 --> 34:00.760]  cover it up because they know they helped cause the disaster of Biden, it's not working.
[34:00.760 --> 34:03.080]  It's not working.
[34:03.080 --> 34:08.760]  So even Democrats that will parrot the same talking points, narratives, policies as Joe
[34:08.760 --> 34:14.680]  Biden, they won't belly up to say that they'll endorse him for 2024 because Biden is that
[34:14.680 --> 34:15.680]  unpopular.
[34:15.680 --> 34:25.720]  And this is a Democrat party that's very loyal, very mono thinking if you will.
[34:25.720 --> 34:28.280]  And they won't get behind Biden for 2024.
[34:28.280 --> 34:33.080]  That just tells you how bad this thing really is.
[34:33.080 --> 34:40.520]  That just tells you how much of a disaster Joe Biden really is.
[34:40.520 --> 34:44.760]  It's getting tougher and tougher for the lying media to cover it up every day.
[34:44.760 --> 34:50.040]  Boy, oh boy, but we've got a response here from the oil companies.
[34:50.040 --> 34:56.200]  I'm going to get to you here in just a second, but ladies and gentlemen, the super summer

[37:24.640 --> 37:30.080]  Infowarstore.com is what keeps us on the air.
[37:30.080 --> 37:41.040]  All right, so no Democrats want to endorse failing Joe, failing, flailing Joe.
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.480]  A news outlet asked every Democrat senator if they'll endorse Biden in 2024.
[37:45.480 --> 37:47.680]  Not many said yes.
[37:47.680 --> 37:49.400]  Not many at all.
[37:49.400 --> 37:51.400]  Only five actually.
[37:51.400 --> 37:58.800]  And I bet they probably would change their answer if they knew it wouldn't be harmonious
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.480]  with the rest of the leftist stuges in the Democrat Party.
[38:03.480 --> 38:09.000]  Another top staffer leaves Biden administration, White House Council departing next month.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.360]  And by the way, folks, look, here's what's been going on in the Kamala Harris and Joe
[38:13.360 --> 38:15.680]  Biden offices.
[38:15.680 --> 38:21.720]  With Kamala, a bunch of people got in there because, hey, it's a job in D.C., it's a job
[38:21.720 --> 38:23.560]  in the White House, vice president.
[38:23.560 --> 38:28.520]  You know, you think, hey, first female, first black female, pretty exciting stuff.
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.720]  So a lot of these people got in there and it was just so miserable that they quit.
[38:34.720 --> 38:39.840]  The dealing with Kamala Harris was too much for these people.
[38:39.840 --> 38:42.440]  She's a very unpleasant person.
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.920]  Not many people like Kamala Harris.
[38:45.920 --> 38:49.120]  They may like her for one thing and one thing only.
[38:49.120 --> 38:57.800]  But so she's been hemorrhaging staffers on her office, in her office, can't replace them.
[38:57.800 --> 39:01.040]  So nobody really knows what's going on with Kamala.
[39:01.040 --> 39:03.760]  She's kind of been the magical disappearing act.
[39:03.760 --> 39:05.800]  The liberals feigned excitement for her.
[39:05.800 --> 39:08.640]  Oh, first female, oh, first black female, all this crap.
[39:08.640 --> 39:11.560]  Yeah, they've thrown her to the trash heap.
[39:11.560 --> 39:14.800]  She's become a non-factor, a non-story, a nothing.
[39:14.800 --> 39:16.080]  But that's the Harris office.
[39:16.080 --> 39:18.760]  Then there's the Biden office.
[39:18.760 --> 39:21.160]  Now with Biden, it was a little bit different.
[39:21.160 --> 39:24.800]  The Democrats brought in a bunch of, they love their tokens.
[39:24.800 --> 39:28.880]  White liberals love their tokens, their tokens of color.
[39:28.880 --> 39:34.200]  Kamala Harris being one of them, the new press secretary being another one of them.
[39:34.200 --> 39:36.600]  White liberals really love their tokens of color.
[39:36.600 --> 39:38.400]  They're sick-racist people.
[39:38.400 --> 39:40.160]  Biden is one of them.
[39:40.160 --> 39:44.560]  And so they had a bunch of token hires in Biden's office.
[39:44.560 --> 39:48.320]  They wanted a bunch of token hires, hey, let's have, you know, quote unquote, diversity.
[39:48.320 --> 39:53.520]  Yeah, that's their cover for racism.
[39:53.520 --> 39:55.240]  Diversity is their cover for racism.
[39:55.240 --> 39:59.580]  Maybe they're just bigots who hire people as tokens.
[39:59.580 --> 40:05.280]  And so they had, in fact, you can plug into a search engine, guys, if you can, almost
[40:05.280 --> 40:11.520]  all the black staffers in Biden's office quit because they realized real quickly they were
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.360]  only hired as token hires.
[40:14.360 --> 40:17.280]  And they didn't really like that treatment, and so they quit.
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.560]  So it's a disaster.
[40:18.560 --> 40:20.840]  Nobody wants to work for these bums.
[40:20.840 --> 40:27.100]  Nobody wants to work for these crooks, these liars, the Bidens, or Kamala Harris.
[40:27.100 --> 40:33.680]  And of course, you know, the media is there to prop them up as something they're not.
[40:33.680 --> 40:37.320]  Here's an example from the Atlantic, Tom Nichols, boy, this guy must be a real piece
[40:37.320 --> 40:42.840]  of work, Tom Nichols from a headline from September 2019 on Trump.
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.040]  If this isn't impeachable, nothing is.
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.160]  Nothing is.
[40:50.160 --> 40:52.480]  That was September 21, 2019.
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.400]  Here's October 11, 2019, Tom Nichols Atlantic, the impeachable tweets.
[40:57.400 --> 41:00.080]  Oh, he's, he's begging for impeachment.
[41:00.080 --> 41:04.880]  Another one, January 21, Trump's removal is taking too long.
[41:04.880 --> 41:07.560]  Oh my, he really, he's really out for Trump.
[41:07.560 --> 41:13.000]  And then here's June 14, 2022, Tom Nichols, leave Joe Biden alone.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.040]  Ah, leave Joe Biden alone, says Tom.
[41:19.040 --> 41:23.200]  Biden's been a good president, but Republicans want to impeach him and some Democrats want
[41:23.200 --> 41:25.040]  to replace him.
[41:25.040 --> 41:30.480]  Think about the political persecution and the obstacles that were put in front of Trump,
[41:30.480 --> 41:41.960]  two fake impeachment shams, and now the January 6 sham, all during election years to harm
[41:41.960 --> 41:47.960]  Donald Trump and to harm this country.
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.800]  Republicans putting politics over everything else, liberals putting their agenda over everything
[41:52.800 --> 41:53.800]  else.
[41:53.800 --> 41:59.000]  Big oil responds to Biden's threats, 10 things you can do to ease gas prices, lift development
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.320]  restrictions on federal lands and waters, designate critical energy infrastructure projects, fix
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.960]  the NEPA permitting process, accelerate LNG exports and approve pending LNG applications,
[42:10.960 --> 42:16.120]  unlock investment and access to capital, dismantle supply chain bottlenecks, advance lower carbon
[42:16.120 --> 42:21.840]  energy tax provisions, protect competition in the use of refining technologies, end permitting
[42:21.840 --> 42:27.880]  obstruction on natural gas projects, advance the energy workforce of the future.
[42:27.880 --> 42:32.800]  The American Petroleum Institute put this out with a statement responding to Joe Biden's
[42:32.800 --> 42:40.160]  lies and blame games on what's going on with the record gas prices and the record energy
[42:40.160 --> 42:42.760]  prices.
[42:42.760 --> 42:47.120]  Now you may not have understood most of that in the 10 things, I know I didn't, but let
[42:47.120 --> 42:51.280]  me translate it for you, Biden, get out of the way.
[42:51.280 --> 42:55.400]  Here's an idea, you want us to help lower gas prices, why don't you get the hell out
[42:55.400 --> 42:58.560]  of the way and stop sabotaging the industry?
[42:58.560 --> 43:04.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[43:04.680 --> 43:07.360]  and hit humanity extremely hard.
[43:07.360 --> 43:13.200]  It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice protect yourselves
[43:13.200 --> 43:17.480]  and your families to the greatest extent possible, and these two new sales do that.
[43:17.480 --> 43:22.640]  We have the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get these four items together, the

[43:59.240 --> 44:09.320]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[44:09.320 --> 44:16.040]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[44:16.040 --> 44:17.040]  lost.
[44:17.040 --> 44:22.240]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[44:22.240 --> 44:30.240]  get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused,
[44:30.240 --> 44:34.840]  you have a concussion, and that's what the globalists have done, they have stunned us,
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.680]  they have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings, and then Klaus Schwab recently
[44:39.680 --> 44:43.720]  came out and gave a speech he called The Great New Narrative, where he brags how the public
[44:43.720 --> 44:48.640]  is lost, how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all
[44:48.640 --> 44:52.560]  alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.

[47:00.600 --> 47:29.400]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:29.400 --> 47:35.920]  I'm sorry to tell you, you probably already know this, but even I as somebody who knows
[47:35.920 --> 47:44.920]  this as good as anybody, I'm just, it's depressing really, it's depressing how fraudulent and
[47:44.920 --> 47:53.320]  phony our media is and the lies from our politicians, it's just, it's really something
[47:53.320 --> 48:00.000]  and we just covered a lot of it dealing with the energy crisis and the record high gas
[48:00.000 --> 48:07.240]  prices, but you know what's going on with Ukraine and Russia and that situation, it
[48:07.240 --> 48:16.360]  might not be as blatant, but it might even be worse actually, because what's happening
[48:16.360 --> 48:22.960]  to America right now geopolitically on the world scale is not really being properly reported
[48:22.960 --> 48:24.680]  or evaluated.
[48:24.680 --> 48:35.280]  I'm not seeing it anywhere actually and it's an odd thing because, how do I say this?
[48:35.280 --> 48:41.680]  It's like, it's so obvious, it's so apparent, you think somebody would have realized it
[48:41.680 --> 48:47.560]  and made a big deal of it and started reporting on it, but no, the fact that the US is losing
[48:47.560 --> 48:55.040]  the respect of most other world powers right now because of Joe Biden, I mean, almost no
[48:55.040 --> 48:57.200]  world leaders respect him.
[48:57.200 --> 49:04.680]  Some won't even answer his phone calls, some just blatantly disrespect him and all the influence
[49:04.680 --> 49:12.520]  that the US has had on this planet is slowly waning and the small bit of it that's left
[49:12.520 --> 49:19.700]  Joe Biden is using it to line his own pockets like he's been doing for decades, but see
[49:19.700 --> 49:25.040]  the rest of the world is waking up to it and they're done and our country's suffering
[49:25.040 --> 49:26.040]  because of it.
[49:26.040 --> 49:30.520]  Now, personally, politically, I don't even mind being an isolationist, I think America
[49:30.520 --> 49:36.480]  can do just fine on its own, but that's not the planet we live on anymore and you can't
[49:36.480 --> 49:43.680]  really be an isolationist anymore because of the global marketplace.
[49:43.680 --> 49:47.720]  That's how it's been built.
[49:47.720 --> 49:54.840]  So when China and Saudi Arabia and Europe and Mexico and Brazil and India and maybe
[49:54.840 --> 49:59.480]  next it'll be Taiwan because we got some developments there, when all of them are completely losing
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.600]  respect for America, I guess here's the analogy.
[50:03.600 --> 50:10.000]  There's a table, there's a world table where leaders sit down to meet, America's not getting
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  invited anymore, folks.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.160]  Our invitation's getting lost in the mail if you catch my drift.
[50:17.160 --> 50:21.120]  We're not there, we're not at the table, we don't have a seat, nobody wants to hear from
[50:21.120 --> 50:22.120]  us.
[50:22.120 --> 50:26.520]  Now, when Trump was there, he had the biggest seat at the head of the table, amazing how
[50:26.520 --> 50:30.360]  that's changed in just less than two short years.
[50:30.360 --> 50:38.120]  So here's what it is, here's the news, done all we can, Macron hints at giving up on Ukraine
[50:38.120 --> 50:40.880]  as Putin destroys NATO supplies.
[50:40.880 --> 50:46.320]  Folks, again, this is another one, it's just the media, it's such a disaster.
[50:46.320 --> 50:50.240]  All these weapons that NATO is supposedly trying to send into Ukraine are going into
[50:50.240 --> 50:54.880]  the same ports and Russia's just blowing them up.
[50:54.880 --> 51:01.800]  It's just a total waste, and it's happened like half a dozen times now.
[51:01.800 --> 51:10.280]  And so again, Biden is trying to lug the EU, lug other NATO nations, lug other countries
[51:10.280 --> 51:14.840]  into this war in Ukraine against Russia, and nobody's taking the bait.
[51:14.840 --> 51:20.600]  So he's having to buy them off with strategic oil reserves and basically say, hey, look,
[51:20.600 --> 51:26.560]  we'll do all the legwork, just give us some lip service along the way.
[51:26.560 --> 51:30.600]  And that's pretty much been the case, but now even Macron is like, look, this is so
[51:30.600 --> 51:35.320]  bad, I don't even want to give it lip service anymore.
[51:35.320 --> 51:39.600]  So will other European leaders follow suit?
[51:39.600 --> 51:47.200]  It's all Biden, folks, it's all, and this will come back later, and I've said this before.
[51:47.200 --> 51:52.000]  Biden has unofficially and illegally launched a war against Russia in Ukraine.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.960]  Now the good news is he's pretty much already lost.
[51:55.960 --> 52:00.360]  We don't want that war, we don't need a war with Russia, it's the worst idea ever.
[52:00.360 --> 52:05.520]  But Biden and then some of his criminal cronies, like their little piggy bank, their little
[52:05.520 --> 52:09.720]  Schluss fund operation, their little money laundering operation, their little sex trafficking
[52:09.720 --> 52:15.280]  operation in Ukraine, they don't want to lose that gemstone in their criminal crown that
[52:15.280 --> 52:21.160]  Russia has taken, that angers Joe Biden, but they've lost it, it's done.
[52:21.160 --> 52:25.680]  So everyone else is abandoning ship here, but Biden is still paying for their loyalty
[52:25.680 --> 52:31.640]  with lip service and paying Zelensky off as well.
[52:31.640 --> 52:35.560]  And so more support now, even though all the NATO weapons are getting either captured by
[52:35.560 --> 52:40.280]  Russia or destroyed by Russia, US to send heavy guided missiles to Ukraine.
[52:40.280 --> 52:43.560]  So there's more missiles going into Ukraine.
[52:43.560 --> 52:46.840]  It's just breaking, that was last night.
[52:46.840 --> 52:52.360]  Joe Biden announces an additional $1.2 billion in aid for Ukraine a day after ranting.
[52:52.360 --> 52:56.120]  I don't want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending, another billion for
[52:56.120 --> 52:57.120]  Ukraine.
[52:57.120 --> 52:58.120]  Where's the money go?
[52:58.120 --> 52:59.120]  Nobody knows.
[52:59.120 --> 53:00.120]  There's no accountability.
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.480]  There's no oversight.
[53:02.480 --> 53:03.480]  Nobody has any idea.
[53:03.480 --> 53:09.480]  Most of the weapons that get over there either end up being destroyed or end up on the black
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.160]  market.
[53:13.160 --> 53:15.240]  And then where is the money going?
[53:15.240 --> 53:18.320]  Because their stories, I've covered them, their stories like in the Associated Press
[53:18.320 --> 53:22.840]  where they say Ukraine is broke, they're like Ukraine has no money, they have no ammunition,
[53:22.840 --> 53:24.720]  they don't know what to do, really.
[53:24.720 --> 53:29.280]  Where's the, I mean, they've proposed over $100 billion for Ukraine.
[53:29.280 --> 53:30.960]  Who knows how much is actually gone?
[53:30.960 --> 53:31.960]  Who knows where it's going?
[53:31.960 --> 53:35.600]  I mean, it's just, it's total, it's total insanity.
[53:35.600 --> 53:36.920]  And here comes another billion.
[53:36.920 --> 53:37.920]  Where's the money going?
[53:37.920 --> 53:40.440]  The Ukraine army says they have no money, no weapons.
[53:40.440 --> 53:41.840]  How can that be?
[53:41.840 --> 53:43.400]  How is that possible?
[53:43.400 --> 53:44.880]  Where's it all going?
[53:44.880 --> 53:46.400]  We have no oversight.
[53:46.400 --> 53:50.320]  It's being stolen, folks, it's being stolen.
[53:50.320 --> 53:53.360]  10% for the big guy.
[53:53.360 --> 53:55.000]  And so this is the new one.
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.840]  Miami announces no questions asked, gun by back, to take guns off the streets and send
[53:59.840 --> 54:00.840]  them to Ukraine.
[54:00.840 --> 54:03.560]  They're literally taking American weapons and sending them into Ukraine.
[54:03.560 --> 54:06.840]  Oh, so I guess the Second Amendment does have a purpose.
[54:06.840 --> 54:09.320]  I guess those AR-15s do have a purpose.
[54:09.320 --> 54:14.120]  I guess all those guns Democrats want to get rid of do have a purpose, don't they?
[54:14.120 --> 54:17.280]  Yeah, they do have a purpose, after all.
[54:17.280 --> 54:20.240]  Purpose for them in Ukraine.
[54:20.240 --> 54:21.480]  You will never need it, though.
[54:21.480 --> 54:22.480]  They need it.
[54:22.480 --> 54:23.920]  The globalists need it for their operation in Ukraine.
[54:23.920 --> 54:27.760]  So disarm American citizens and give them to Ukrainian civilians.
[54:27.760 --> 54:28.760]  Gotcha.
[54:28.760 --> 54:30.320]  That's the policy here.
[54:30.320 --> 54:35.720]  Nicaragua, Nicaragua approves joint military exercise with Russia.
[54:35.720 --> 54:39.080]  Oh, how do you like them, apples?
[54:39.080 --> 54:43.600]  Mexico's on Russia's side, Nicaragua says, basically is inviting the Russian army.
[54:43.600 --> 54:45.000]  They're excited.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  Nicaragua's excited.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.240]  This is one of the most exciting things that's happened to them.
[54:48.240 --> 54:49.720]  It's like, oh, Russia's coming in.
[54:49.720 --> 54:51.360]  They want to do joint military exercises.
[54:51.360 --> 54:53.160]  Yes, please, Putin, please, we love it.
[54:53.160 --> 54:54.160]  We love the Russians.
[54:54.160 --> 54:55.840]  Bring them in, yes.
[54:55.840 --> 54:56.840]  Wow.
[54:56.840 --> 54:59.720]  Did you see that one coming?
[54:59.720 --> 55:01.240]  Right down there.
[55:01.240 --> 55:05.600]  And hell, I mean, I guess the Russian army could just amass a Nicaragua.
[55:05.600 --> 55:08.120]  They just start marching north until they get to the southern border.
[55:08.120 --> 55:10.520]  It's wide open anyway.
[55:10.520 --> 55:12.240]  What's going to stop them from doing that?
[55:12.240 --> 55:15.880]  Did you ever think about that, Libs?
[55:15.880 --> 55:17.880]  Anybody could do it.
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.280]  Government, German government labels, journalist, criminal, freezes bank account over Ukraine
[55:22.280 --> 55:23.720]  war reporting in Donbas.
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.280]  Yeah, this independent journalist is one of the few that are actually there.
[55:28.280 --> 55:35.400]  Elena Lip, that's actually there on the scenes, folks, look, who knows what's really
[55:35.400 --> 55:36.400]  going on.
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.840]  But everybody in Donbas and that Eastern region knows.
[55:40.840 --> 55:42.640]  It wasn't Russia that was shelling the cities.
[55:42.640 --> 55:44.320]  It wasn't Russia that was killing the civilians.
[55:44.320 --> 55:47.080]  It was Ukraine.
[55:47.080 --> 55:52.120]  It was Ukraine and it was NATO and it was the Azov battalion and it was Western front
[55:52.120 --> 55:57.080]  groups and they all know it and they reported on it and now they're getting shut down.
[55:57.080 --> 55:58.200]  They're getting censored.
[55:58.200 --> 56:02.080]  They're getting their bank accounts frozen because you're not allowed to report the truth
[56:02.080 --> 56:03.720]  on these situations of war.
[56:03.720 --> 56:04.720]  Don't you know?
[56:04.720 --> 56:06.560]  You have to have the corporate war.
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.400]  You have to have the corrupt wars go on.
[56:09.400 --> 56:15.320]  People can't know it's Ukraine bombing its own people and they won't support the war.
[56:15.320 --> 56:19.800]  Zelensky caught red-handed destroying evidence of Hunter Biden biolab network.
[56:19.800 --> 56:20.800]  Stories at infowars.com.
[56:20.800 --> 56:23.160]  Oh, first they said it's Russian propaganda.
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.600]  Then the Pentagon came out and admitted actually we have 46 biolabs in Ukraine and now Ukraine
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.760]  has blown them all up hiding the evidence.
[56:31.760 --> 56:32.760]  Isn't it fun?
[56:32.760 --> 56:34.280]  Isn't it fun to be lied to?
[56:34.280 --> 56:39.240]  Ukraine threatens to destroy Europe's longest bridge and it turns out this is actually Western
[56:39.240 --> 56:44.520]  U.S. strategy, really.
[56:44.520 --> 56:50.200]  They're trying to pressure Ukraine into blowing up the biggest bridge in the region.
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.480]  Folks, if they do that, I mean, the whole world will turn against America.
[56:54.480 --> 56:55.480]  I'm sorry.
[56:55.480 --> 56:57.480]  It's just ridiculous.
[56:57.480 --> 57:00.760]  But hey, it might hurt Russia, so let's blow up that bridge.
[57:00.760 --> 57:06.960]  Maripul Deja Vu, Ukraine fighters and civilians trapped in besieged Severn-Dontesk chemical
[57:06.960 --> 57:07.960]  plant.
[57:07.960 --> 57:10.360]  So another situation, a bunch of Ukrainians being held hostage.
[57:10.360 --> 57:11.360]  They're losing the war.
[57:11.360 --> 57:13.160]  Media tells you they're winning.
[57:13.160 --> 57:15.000]  And then there's China.
[57:15.000 --> 57:20.160]  China's President Xi Jinping has signed a directive allowing for a quote-unquote non-war
[57:20.160 --> 57:24.720]  uses of the military, raising concerns it could pave the way for an invasion of Taiwan, fears
[57:24.720 --> 57:28.440]  for Taiwan as China lanes groundwork for its own special military operation.
[57:28.440 --> 57:32.480]  Now why are they calling it a non-war or a special military operation?
[57:32.480 --> 57:35.360]  Because that's the precedent Joe Biden has said in Ukraine.
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.120]  So China's basically saying if Joe Biden can illegally launch a war against Russia in Ukraine
[57:40.120 --> 57:45.840]  and not tell anybody, we, the Chinese military, can do the same thing in Taiwan and now they're
[57:45.840 --> 57:49.680]  getting ready to do it.
[57:49.680 --> 57:54.920]  There's an old Bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[57:54.920 --> 57:55.920]  Trust in God.
[57:55.920 --> 58:01.120]  But tie up your camel, Hunter S. Thompson put it this way, pray to God but row away from
[58:01.120 --> 58:02.120]  the rocks.
[58:02.120 --> 58:05.920]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[58:05.920 --> 58:07.920]  and killed but also try to row away.
[58:07.920 --> 58:12.080]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[58:12.080 --> 58:14.160]  God helps those who help themselves.

[59:51.040 --> 1:00:03.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:11.080]  Remember that liar, Anthony Fauci?
[1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:12.080]  Yeah.
[1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:15.640]  He's got COVID.
[1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:20.080]  It's funny because he's quadruple injected.
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:22.920]  He's taken four of the clot shots.
[1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.760]  Four of the vades, supposedly he has.
[1:00:26.760 --> 1:00:28.600]  But let's flash it back, guys.
[1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:32.920]  Don't you remember, Anthony Fauci told you how effective and you'd never get COVID if
[1:00:32.920 --> 1:00:34.560]  you got the vaccine here in clip three?
[1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:35.560]  Remember this?
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:39.240]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[1:00:39.240 --> 1:00:43.680]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[1:00:43.680 --> 1:00:47.640]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:53.600]  Interesting, because you've taken four injections and you have COVID.
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:55.520]  You have COVID.
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:01:04.960]  So either you lied about the vaccine or the test doesn't work.
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.920]  Which one is it, Fauci?
[1:01:06.920 --> 1:01:10.200]  Trick question, both.
[1:01:10.200 --> 1:01:14.880]  The answer is actually both, but I'll give Fauci credit.
[1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:19.120]  He's actually working through his supposed sickness.
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.720]  And so here he is begging for more money.
[1:01:22.720 --> 1:01:24.760]  I mean, this guy is just a rat.
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:29.360]  This is just a criminal rat, a money-grubbing rat.
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:35.560]  And so here he is in clip two with COVID, begging for more money.
[1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:41.360]  My age is to do the basic clinical and translational research to develop the countermeasures that
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.240]  we have so successfully been part of that process to get us the vaccines, therapeutics
[1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:48.800]  and diagnostics.
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:53.840]  As you mentioned in your opening statement, this virus is changing and we need to keep
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:54.840]  up with it.
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:59.880]  In order to do that, we've got to do better with new vaccine platforms such as nanoparticle
[1:01:59.880 --> 1:02:00.880]  vaccines.
[1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:05.280]  We cannot proceed with that unless we get additional funding.
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:09.120]  Finally, we need to both prevent infection and transmission.
[1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:16.320]  We know that we cannot do that unless we get a highly effective eucosal or intranasal vaccine.
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:21.760]  We have a number of projects that will not be able to be funded unless we do get new
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:25.200]  resources to continue these funding.
[1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:29.680]  These are challenges that we have that I believe will be letting the American people down if
[1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:35.000]  we do not use our scientific capabilities to meet the next challenge of this ever-changing
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  virus.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  Thank you.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Thank you.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:42.400]  You know what I would do if I was trying to catch a rat criminal like Fauci and this
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:46.600]  should have been done already, so it's probably too late anyway, but you know what, I would
[1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:50.280]  actually say, okay, you know what, let's release those funds.
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:54.120]  Let's give those funds to Fauci or wherever he says they're going to and let's follow
[1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:55.480]  that money.
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:03:00.920]  How much you want to bet some of that money ends up in Fauci's pocket?
[1:03:00.920 --> 1:03:06.760]  Boy, oh boy, I feel pretty confident, I feel pretty strongly that somehow all these fundings
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:12.440]  and money initiatives end up in Fauci's pocket.
[1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:15.000]  How did that rat bastard get so rich?
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:22.960]  Remember the story that came out how basically the NIH or whatever government bureaucracy
[1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:28.600]  he was working with was getting hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions
[1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:39.600]  of dollars for quote-unquote special projects, and when transparency groups requested that
[1:03:39.600 --> 1:03:47.280]  the allocation of those monies and where those monies went to be made transparent and reported
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.720]  on, they said, I know thank you.
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:51.720]  I know thank you.
[1:03:51.720 --> 1:03:53.200]  We will keep it secret.
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:55.400]  We will keep our money secret.
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:04:02.080]  Yes, I am Anthony Fauci, I am the highest paid government employee, I've been stealing
[1:04:02.080 --> 1:04:08.040]  money from you for decades, I get hundreds of millions of dollars in special projects
[1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:12.720]  and I put it all right back in my own little pocket.
[1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:16.840]  I'm very rich and powerful, don't you know, I'm Fauci.
[1:04:16.840 --> 1:04:18.560]  So he's there begging for more money.
[1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:19.560]  We need more vaccines.
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:24.720]  Oh, the vaccine that you said would be safe and effective and was neither safe or effective
[1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.000]  and now he's up there begging for more money.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.400]  Who would give that rat criminal liar a dime?
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:40.160]  Democrats, that's who and I'm sure they will fund whatever project Fauci wants to work
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:41.800]  on next.
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:48.680]  Wow, so there he is folks, he promised you if you get the vaccine, you won't get COVID.
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:53.560]  He claims to have had four of them and now he has COVID, not even wearing a mask.
[1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:58.840]  Wow, spreading COVID all over the planet too, wow.
[1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:04.480]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:05.960]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:11.680]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:16.920]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:05:16.920 --> 1:05:23.080]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents, it's now out
[1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:24.080]  in the open.
[1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:29.240]  Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  Group.
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:35.360]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[1:05:35.360 --> 1:05:36.360]  behind schedule.
[1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:37.360]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:40.760]  God's watching, the children are counting on us, I just want to thank the viewers and
[1:05:40.760 --> 1:05:44.160]  listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because
[1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:46.520]  without you, info wars would not be here.
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:50.960]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.240]  reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:05:53.240 --> 1:05:57.760]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble
[1:05:57.760 --> 1:06:27.720]  your efforts.
[49:40.700 --> 1:06:45.720]  yes, one thing liberals hate is looking into the mirror and angers them, very much
[1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:46.720]  so.
[1:06:46.720 --> 1:06:50.920]  Two things, if you want to anger a liberal, two things you can do, tell them the truth
[1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:55.520]  or put a mirror in front of their face, two things that anger the liberals like nothing
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:56.520]  else.
[1:06:56.520 --> 1:07:01.640]  And of course, that's why they're trying to censor libs of tick tock because libs of
[1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:07.000]  tick tock is just a mirror, a mirror of themselves.
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.240]  But boy, oh boy, they are really obsessed with grooming children.
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:12.040]  It is really an odd thing.
[1:07:12.040 --> 1:07:16.880]  So I've got a bunch of these clips from Biden yesterday at a child grooming White House
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:17.880]  event.
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:21.040]  But let's look at some of the news first here.
[1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:25.240]  Breaking Biden to ban conversion therapy for gender identity.
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:32.360]  Now, folks, I have to tell you here, this is all really confusing to me and I'm not trying
[1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:33.360]  to make a joke.
[1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:37.600]  I'm being serious and it's meant to be that way.
[1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:44.000]  But it's so nonsensical, it's so confusing, it's straight up clown world behavior here.
[1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:49.640]  And so my best understanding, because I read the bill or the executive order rather, I
[1:07:49.640 --> 1:07:53.680]  read the EO and I read the story and it still makes no sense to me.
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:07:54.680]  Of course not.
[1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:59.840]  You can be women, women can be men, you can be a man, woman, man, child, bear pig.
[1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:01.880]  So it's just total insanity.
[1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:06.040]  Kids having multiple transgender surgeries or reverse surgeries.
[1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:13.640]  So my understanding is basically that Biden wants to make it illegal to have what they
[1:08:13.640 --> 1:08:16.360]  call conversion therapy.
[1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.920]  And again, I'm not trying to be funny here.
[1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:20.160]  None of this makes any sense, folks.
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:21.400]  You can go read the executive order.
[1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.040]  You can read the story in the post millennial.
[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:25.560]  I mean, it just scrambles your brain.
[1:08:25.560 --> 1:08:26.560]  And that's the whole point.
[1:08:26.560 --> 1:08:29.080]  Imagine what it's going to do to children.
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:39.600]  But my best understanding is that Biden is making it illegal to have therapies or interventions
[1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:45.840]  that would stop a child from having transgender surgery.
[1:08:45.840 --> 1:08:50.560]  Or like if a child says, hey, you know, a five-year-old says, hey, it's a girl and says, oh, I'm
[1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:51.560]  a boy.
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:52.560]  I'm a boy.
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:53.560]  I'm a top surgery.
[1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:59.680]  And it becomes a serious psychological problem with this mental disorder.
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:04.840]  You can take them to conversion therapy just so that they understand, no, you're a girl.
[1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:06.840]  That's what you are.
[1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:09.960]  Or vice versa, whatever the case is.
[1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:18.200]  So that's basically, so Biden is making it illegal or even with gay, like, oh, gay homosexual
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:21.480]  conversion therapy, like, you know, get you straight again or something like that.
[1:09:21.480 --> 1:09:25.760]  Like, he's signed an executive order making all of that illegal.
[1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:29.520]  Again, it's my best understanding.
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:31.720]  You can try to read it for yourself.
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:35.200]  It might as well be in another language because it is.
[1:09:35.200 --> 1:09:37.080]  There's men and there's women and that's it.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:40.560]  They start throwing all these other things in there so it gets confusing.
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:44.240]  But this is from the post-millennial story I quote directly and they're quoting from
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:47.240]  the bill or the executive order.
[1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:51.800]  Women told parents across America to affirm their children, meaning that should a child
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:58.120]  claim to be what they are not, parents should nod affirmatively and sign them up for irreverable
[1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:02.960]  courses of medical treatment that will prevent them from living a full life.
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:07.800]  So in other words, force your kid to be transgender if they even, like, a girl wears a basketball
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:09.040]  jersey or something.
[1:10:09.040 --> 1:10:13.520]  This new order states that so-called conversion therapy must be banned across the country.
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:20.440]  So in other words, but it's not just that, if you try to stop your child from having
[1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:25.420]  a sexual reassignment surgery, you're now the criminal.
[1:10:25.420 --> 1:10:28.480]  Or if you're a school or a psychologist or anybody that's trying to do this, whether
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.680]  it's homosexuality or transects or any of this other stuff, this executive order makes
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:35.840]  that illegal.
[1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.480]  What?
[1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:40.160]  What is that?
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:45.240]  The executive order is intended to mark Pride Month and will prevent so-called conversion
[1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.680]  therapy with a historic initiative to protect children from the harmful practice.
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:52.440]  That's a quote from the executive order.
[1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:57.280]  The harmful practice of not chopping their genitals up.
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:00.800]  The harmful practice of not chopping a little boy's penis off.
[1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:04.900]  The harmful practice of not mutilating a little girl's genitals.
[1:11:04.900 --> 1:11:05.900]  That harmful practice.
[1:11:05.900 --> 1:11:12.380]  If you want to stop kids from having their genitals chopped up, this executive order now
[1:11:12.380 --> 1:11:16.080]  labels you a criminal.
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:20.280]  As well as safeguarding health care and programs designed to prevent you suicide.
[1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:27.560]  So in other words, you have a higher likelihood of committing suicide if you are in the transgender
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:34.320]  community and they say by doing this, they're going to decrease suicide.
[1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:38.200]  So by putting people into the group that has the highest rate of suicide, they're planning
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.040]  on decreasing suicide.
[1:11:40.040 --> 1:11:43.040]  Again, folks, none of it makes sense.
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:46.240]  I'm trying my best to make sense of this for you.
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:56.200]  It's just more sexual deviancy, more grooming of the children, more perverted pedophilia.
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:12:00.840]  This sweeping executive order requiring federal agencies to comply will issue guidance to
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:08.360]  states on gender affirmation, which the president believes is essential to protect children.
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:12.520]  Chopping up little boys and girls genitals is essential to protecting children, says
[1:12:12.520 --> 1:12:13.520]  Joe Biden.
[1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:16.200]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:20.680]  Here's some of the quotes from his event, his Pride event at the White House yesterday.
[1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:23.520]  Guys, just roll me clips nine through 11.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:29.120]  While in attacks on the community, including ongoing attacks on transgender women of color.
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:34.160]  He's got marbles in his mouth because the attacks are more than ever last year and they're
[1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:35.760]  on pace again this year.
[1:12:35.760 --> 1:12:36.760]  What?
[1:12:36.760 --> 1:12:37.760]  Disgusting.
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:38.760]  What does that even mean?
[1:12:38.760 --> 1:12:39.760]  I have to stop.
[1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:40.760]  What is he talking about?
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:45.160]  Right now there are young people sitting in their bedroom, doors closed, silent, scrolling
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:46.960]  through social media.
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:47.960]  You know what?
[1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:48.960]  Turn him off.
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:49.960]  I can't take this creep, man.
[1:12:49.960 --> 1:12:52.840]  I don't want to hear Joe Biden fantasizing about little kids in bed, okay?
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:54.840]  I'm sorry.
[1:12:54.840 --> 1:12:55.920]  I'm sorry.
[1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:57.560]  I don't want to listen to mush mouth anymore.
[1:12:57.560 --> 1:12:59.640]  This guy sounds like he's got marble in his mouth.
[1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:01.440]  He's up there fantasizing about kids in bed.
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:03.600]  I mean, what a sick freak.
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:04.600]  Here he is.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:07.000]  Guys, give me clip 10 quickly.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:13.120]  Here he is fumbling through, I mean, I don't blame LGBTQIA, Niner, 69, Topeka, Topeka,
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:17.000]  Washington, Blue 16, Blue 16, Hut Hut, Hike Plus, sexual agenda.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.440]  Here he is fumbling that.
[1:13:18.440 --> 1:13:25.280]  Let me say, as commander in chief, I'm proud to have ended the Un-American ban on transgender
[1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:28.680]  Americans serving in our militant.
[1:13:28.680 --> 1:13:39.080]  I mean, honestly, guys, you know, bring me a bag of marbles, and I'll put them in my
[1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:42.440]  mouth and see if I can sound like Joe Biden.
[1:13:42.440 --> 1:13:43.840]  And then here's the first lady.
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:46.960]  She's a complete embarrassment.
[1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.960]  She had to get a little word in here, too, in clip 11.
[1:13:49.960 --> 1:13:58.840]  In places across the country, like Florida, Texas, or Alabama, rights are under attack.
[1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:05.960]  And we know that in small towns and big cities, prejudice and discrimination still lurk.
[1:14:05.960 --> 1:14:06.960]  Uh-huh.
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:07.960]  I see.
[1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:08.960]  Okay.
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:14.640]  Oh, boy, oh, boy, man, these people, when will we not have to deal with these demons
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:15.640]  anymore?
[1:14:15.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  Maybe never.
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:21.360]  A Michigan attorney general says drag queens make everything better, suggest a drag queen
[1:14:21.360 --> 1:14:22.360]  for every school.
[1:14:22.360 --> 1:14:23.360]  Oh, that's nice.
[1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:28.360]  Your local pedophile now works at the school and gets special access to children.
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.760]  That's a Democrat party policy there.
[1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:31.760]  How's that going to go?
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:32.760]  How about this one?
[1:14:32.760 --> 1:14:37.240]  Idaho police investigating drag queen who may have exposed genitals to children at local
[1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:38.240]  LGBT event.
[1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:40.720]  No, not may have, did.
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:41.880]  And this isn't the first time.
[1:14:41.880 --> 1:14:42.880]  It's not the second time.
[1:14:42.880 --> 1:14:44.000]  It's not the third time.
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:47.700]  It's the fourth time that I've seen on camera alone.
[1:14:47.700 --> 1:14:55.520]  It's the fourth time I've seen a male drag queen flash, uh, trouser snake to young kids
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.120]  at a Pride event.
[1:14:57.120 --> 1:15:00.440]  I've seen it on camera four times myself.
[1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:01.840]  Hey, what?
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:04.900]  We need to put that in every school, said the pedophile Democrats.
[1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:06.560]  This is how you respond.
[1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:10.060]  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announces she is introducing Bill to make it illegal
[1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:14.200]  for children to be exposed to drag queen performances, similar bill in Texas.
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:15.360]  This is what you do.
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:17.800]  Make Democrats defend this publicly.
[1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:21.280]  Make Democrats publicly defend their pedophilia.
[1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:25.400]  Make Democrats publicly defend their sexual perversions.
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:26.960]  Put this out in the public.
[1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:30.400]  They hate you looking at the lives of TikTok account because it shows you what the left
[1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:31.400]  is up to.
[1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:34.120]  So let's make the left defended on a national stage.
[1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.240]  Good for Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:40.160]  Black sniffing dog helps in pedophile arrest in Mexico.
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:46.880]  Yeah, this, uh, minor attracted person activist from Europe was down in Mexico City and, uh,
[1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:48.280]  they were able to find him.
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.480]  You know, it's because they say it's minor attracted persons now.
[1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:51.480]  You need to respect them.
[1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:52.480]  And this dog found them.
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:57.960]  Can you imagine if this dog was in the Biden house, he'd probably be going crazy.
[1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:03.240]  There's an old better one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:04.240]  Trust in God.
[1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:06.240]  But tie up your camel.
[1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:08.040]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:10.280]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[1:16:10.280 --> 1:16:14.240]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:15.240]  and killed.
[1:16:15.240 --> 1:16:16.240]  But also try to row away.
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:20.360]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system.
[1:16:20.360 --> 1:16:22.440]  God helps those who help themselves.

[1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:04.440]  carefully.
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:10.680]  The Nestosus have made the most important documentary in US history, 2,000 mules.
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:12.240]  That's not hype.
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:13.400]  That's the truth.
[1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:19.040]  The film proves how the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:20.040]  to do it again.
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:25.560]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with
[1:17:25.560 --> 1:17:29.520]  the expanded extras so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:34.160]  can show it to your church, your business, your neighbors, or just perfect strangers.

[1:17:56.200 --> 1:18:03.960]  I'm a humble person and I want to say that I'm just a man, but I'm not just a man.
[1:18:03.960 --> 1:18:08.480]  It's like you, no matter what color you are, whether you're a man or a woman, you were
[1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:13.840]  made by the creator of the universe who had a plan for you, who has a destiny for you.
[1:18:13.840 --> 1:18:17.920]  That's why the system hates you and fears you and that's why they hate me.
[1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:22.920]  It's because the spirit I carry is one of justice and truth and courage and honor and
[1:18:22.920 --> 1:18:24.920]  will and love.
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:29.680]  My friends, the enemy's coming after me, not because I'm a loser, but because I'm a winner.
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:34.680]  They're coming after you, not because you're a bad person, because you're a good person,
[1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:38.240]  or because you love God and God loves you.
[1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:39.400]  And so I signed up for this.
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:41.960]  I signed up for this fight and I'm not a victim.
[1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.440]  I'm an overcomer, but I can't fight this fight without you and that's why I want you
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:50.400]  to always remember that I appreciate you and I thank you because Info Wars is your fight.
[1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:51.400]  Info Wars is your baby.
[1:18:51.400 --> 1:18:53.080]  It's the thing you built.
[1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:54.240]  We did this together.
[1:18:54.240 --> 1:18:55.720]  So God bless you all.
[1:18:55.720 --> 1:18:56.720]  Let's keep fighting.
[1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.520]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when
[1:19:00.520 --> 1:19:04.520]  the internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this
[1:19:04.520 --> 1:19:06.200]  is going to level the playing field.
[1:19:06.200 --> 1:19:08.560]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's going to be able
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:11.360]  to freely communicate that information.
[1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:17.320]  That's our goal, to get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:22.360]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:27.240]  we want, and we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying
[1:19:27.240 --> 1:19:34.480]  to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations
[1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:39.480]  we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions,
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:42.000]  the people we want to talk to about these things.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:46.200]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take
[1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:47.200]  back their privacy.
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:52.560]  And so that's really what we're trying to do, and so I hope that everybody listening will
[1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:54.920]  check us out at boltowireless.com.
[1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:58.760]  That's B-O-L-T-A, wireless.com.
[1:19:58.760 --> 1:20:10.120]  Meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:10.120 --> 1:20:27.400]  You know, there's been an awful lot of talk about extremist behavior here, and it's funny
[1:20:27.400 --> 1:20:33.040]  because we're ignoring the actual violent extremists, and Democrats are just going after
[1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:39.000]  their political opposition, but of course that's what the terrorist would do, and that's
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.160]  the Democrat Party, the largest terror group in the history of this country, continues
[1:20:43.160 --> 1:20:48.320]  to operate, and it will continue to be that until it is shut down.
[1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:57.040]  So they are ready to riot, burn, loot, plunder, assault, if their rovers wade decision comes
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:01.400]  down at any time, they are just ready to go.
[1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:06.080]  The Democrats have their terrorists out in the streets ready to burn, loot, riot, steal,
[1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:12.840]  assault, burn churches, burn pregnancy centers, and it's an odd thing because what is the
[1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:17.360]  complaint that they can't kill their baby anymore?
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:22.480]  Which is duly odd because, one, 99% of these women are not going to have an abortion, so
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:24.680]  it doesn't affect them at all.
[1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:30.280]  And then two, this decision does not ban abortions or make abortions illegal in America.
[1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:38.800]  So the two things they think they're protesting neither exists, typical liberal dumbasses.
[1:21:38.800 --> 1:21:44.320]  But no, they are, actually they were in front of Kavanaugh's house last night, again, in
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:51.280]  front of Kavanaugh's house, and they have posted two groups in D.C. actually, two groups
[1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:57.760]  in D.C. right now getting ready to riot if they think they can't kill their babies anymore.
[1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:02.600]  And that's shut down D.C., boy, with a name like shut down D.C., you think the Democrats
[1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:08.960]  will be crying insurrection, they're not because it's their people, it's their terrorist groups.
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:15.480]  And then you have Jane's Revenge, which is openly making statements, openly publishing
[1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:21.800]  addresses, openly encouraging violence to pregnancy centers.
[1:22:21.800 --> 1:22:26.520]  I've got the full statement right here that they're posting all over the streets of D.C.
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:29.440]  and other areas where they operate.
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:34.520]  Full statement from Jane's Revenge announcing that it's open season on pro-life pregnancy
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:35.520]  centers.
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:39.600]  Future measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and
[1:22:39.600 --> 1:22:42.180]  graffiti, the terrorist group threatens.
[1:22:42.180 --> 1:22:45.680]  Nothing from the FBI, anything from the Department of Homeland Security.
[1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:52.960]  Yeah, in fact, guys, it is the liberal summer of rage, after all, and so here we are, once
[1:22:52.960 --> 1:23:07.880]  again, covering the liberal summer of rage, liberal summer of rage, ah yes, ah yes, the
[1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:10.080]  liberal summer of rage.
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:13.560]  And so they're openly saying, we're going to burn pregnancy centers, we're going to
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:17.880]  burn churches, here's our targets, here's our address, we're burning them to the ground
[1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:20.880]  and we might do worse.
[1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.320]  Nothing from the FBI, nothing from the Department of Homeland Security.
[1:23:23.320 --> 1:23:26.760]  It's encouraged, in fact, by the Democrat Party.
[1:23:26.760 --> 1:23:32.800]  They've already fire bombed more than 10 pregnancy centers since the leak, since the Supreme
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:36.240]  Court leak, which we still don't have the leaker, why not?
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:37.640]  Because the leaker's a Democrat.
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:42.080]  Our left pro-abortion group, James Revenge, issues terroristic threat against pro-life
[1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:48.160]  pregnancy centers and it's ignored by the media, it's ignored by the Democrats, it's
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:52.320]  ignored by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security because they're all in it, they're
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:56.920]  all part of the same terrorist group, it's called the Democrat Party.
[1:23:56.920 --> 1:24:03.680]  James Revenge, shut down DC, weather underground, these are all just offshoots of the larger
[1:24:03.680 --> 1:24:07.040]  terror group, the Democrat Party.
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:11.280]  One group claims responsibility for recent attacks, again, they don't even hide it.
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:15.440]  They post it right there, they put it on the buildings that they burned to the ground and
[1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.760]  vandalized, put James Revenge on there.
[1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:18.920]  Anybody investigating that?
[1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:20.360]  Any hearings on that?
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:21.480]  Anything on that?
[1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:22.480]  Domestic terror group?
[1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:23.480]  No.
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:24.480]  They're Democrats, they're allowed to do it.
[1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:31.520]  And what is with white liberals that love to make black people commit crimes in their
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:32.520]  agenda?
[1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:33.520]  Have you noticed that?
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:37.920]  White liberals love to put black people on the front lines, white liberals love to have
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:39.800]  black people commit crimes for them.
[1:24:39.800 --> 1:24:40.800]  Have you ever noticed that?
[1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:45.400]  I don't know why white liberals love using black people to commit crimes so much, but
[1:24:45.400 --> 1:24:47.840]  they do, they really do.
[1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:53.720]  And so that's why they're trying to drum up hatred right now in the black community and
[1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:56.160]  anger if they can't have abortions.
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:01.800]  And so here's a story from a Florida source, actually it's from, it's in Tennessee, it's
[1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:07.360]  Tampa Bay dot com, stakes high for black women in states that could ban abortion.
[1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.720]  Well, what, why would that, why would the stakes be high for black women?
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:18.160]  Well, because of the vast majority of abortions in this country are black women's abortions,
[1:25:18.160 --> 1:25:20.080]  black babies being aborted.
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:24.240]  That was the entire purpose of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the black population, just
[1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:25.560]  ask Margaret Sanger.
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:30.960]  The entire operational agenda of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the black population in America
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:35.960]  and they've done a great job of it, 40 million black babies murdered by Planned Parenthood.
[1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:37.600]  So it's done a good job.
[1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:41.840]  But they say, oh, so that's a bad thing that black babies aren't going to be murdered by
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:43.960]  their mothers anymore.
[1:25:43.960 --> 1:25:47.440]  And they're all worried about this Dobbs versus Jackson women health organization.
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:51.320]  This Mississippi case they think is going to be the kind of the crutch of the whole thing.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:56.120]  But no, this is, this is Democrats trying to rile up black people to get out in the streets
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:25:58.360]  and commit crimes for them again.
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.760]  White liberals riling up black people to go out in the streets and commit crimes for them.
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:05.920]  Really amazing stuff.
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.320]  Supreme Court rifts divide abortion views in Mississippi.
[1:26:08.320 --> 1:26:13.280]  Yeah, they're making it all about that case.
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:14.280]  Abortion this one.
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:15.280]  Oh, this is hilarious, folks.
[1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:16.800]  This is, oh my gosh.
[1:26:16.800 --> 1:26:17.800]  This is from Bloomberg.
[1:26:17.800 --> 1:26:19.080]  I had a good laugh at this last night.
[1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:25.320]  Let me tell you abortion care workers abortion care care, don't you love care?
[1:26:25.320 --> 1:26:26.320]  What care?
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:27.840]  No, it's abortion.
[1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:29.960]  But see, they know abortion is murder.
[1:26:29.960 --> 1:26:34.600]  So now they're trying to murder care, murder care workers care.
[1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:35.600]  They love throwing the care.
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:38.960]  They have their little words that they try to gloss over what they're really up to.
[1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:39.960]  It's murder.
[1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:40.960]  So they call it abortion care.
[1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:41.960]  Hmm.
[1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:43.440]  You know, murder sounds really bad.
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:44.440]  Most people don't like murder.
[1:26:44.440 --> 1:26:45.440]  It's not really good.
[1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.720]  It's not really going over well in our think groups and our think tanks.
[1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:49.840]  What can we do?
[1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:51.400]  We can't call it murder.
[1:26:51.400 --> 1:26:52.400]  So what should we call it?
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:54.000]  Let's call it abortion care.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  Brilliant.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.720]  Brilliant strategy.
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:59.360]  Abortion care.
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:05.360]  Abortion care workers look to unionize, oh, as road decision approaches.
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:08.000]  Now this, folks, it gets better.
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.920]  Employees at abortion clinics are dealing with burnout.
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:11.920]  They're burnt out.
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.160]  They've committed so many murders.
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:18.480]  They're burnt out and exhaustion just as reproductive rights in the U.S. are hanging
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:19.480]  by a thread.
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:20.480]  Wait a second.
[1:27:20.480 --> 1:27:21.480]  Hold on.
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:22.480]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:23.560]  I'm confused here.
[1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:28.840]  You're suffering from burnout and exhaustion, but you're complaining that there's no abortions
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:31.040]  happening anymore.
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:37.480]  You're complaining that you work too much, and so therefore you want more abortions?
[1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:42.080]  I'm just trying to, this is, this is their logic.
[1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:45.760]  And so they're unionizing so they can have more abortions?
[1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:46.920]  What?
[1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:51.280]  They're burnt out because they've had so many abortions, even though they're complaining
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:56.640]  that there's not enough abortions, and they're afraid that there might not be any more abortions,
[1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:01.960]  but they're complaining about how they're tired of so many abortions?
[1:28:01.960 --> 1:28:04.560]  I don't have it, folks.
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:05.800]  I don't have this logic.
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:06.800]  It's liberal logic.
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:10.960]  You try to make sense of it, but there it is.
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:15.600]  So murder, murder workers, excuse me, abortion care workers are burnt out from working so
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:20.280]  much with the abortions so they're unionizing so there can be more abortions.
[1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:23.320]  I tell ya, you just, more liberal summer of rage.
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:29.200]  Boston BDS map of Jewish groups has potential to incite violence, yeah, it's the pro-Palestine
[1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:31.480]  left that hates Jews and Israel.
[1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:35.440]  It's funny because you have the anti-Israel left and the anti-Israel right.
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:39.400]  The anti-Israel right doesn't like Israel's influence in the West and doesn't like the
[1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:41.840]  Jewish influence in a Christian nation.
[1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:46.880]  The anti-Israel left just hates Israel, hates Jews, and wants to see it burn to the ground
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:49.440]  and is pro-Palestine.
[1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:53.160]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, oh, radicals in Wisconsin, vandalized side of
[1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:56.800]  Tuesday night's fundraiser for GOP candidate, oh, more liberal terrorism.
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:03.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity
[1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:05.920]  and hit humanity extremely hard.

[1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:03.720]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan, Alex Jones was right.
[1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:05.240]  People ask, what's it like to be vindicated?
[1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:11.120]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming, I tried to stop it,
[1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:16.200]  and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever because
[1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:21.360]  the globalists aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents.
[1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:22.960]  It's now out in the open.
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:28.520]  Claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth, the Bilderberg group founded Davos
[1:30:28.520 --> 1:30:29.520]  Group.
[1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:34.640]  So now the fight's out in the open, they're making their move because they know they're
[1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:35.640]  behind schedule.
[1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:36.640]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.560]  God's watching the children counting on us.
[1:30:38.560 --> 1:30:42.400]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and

[1:30:50.120 --> 1:30:52.480]  the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:57.000]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble

[1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:16.360]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:16.360 --> 1:33:30.600]  You've found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:35.160]  So the question is about gas prices and inflation, you know what I could do, if you could give
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:42.800]  me a time machine to go back to January 20, 2021, we would just do the opposite of what
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:48.080]  Biden has done and we'd be in a better spot, no I mean I really think it's, he's got a
[1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:55.520]  lot of hook spot to attack energy producers when he campaigned saying he was going to
[1:33:55.520 --> 1:33:58.400]  shut down energy production in the United States.
[1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:01.400]  He said we're not going to let him drill, we're not going to give leases, we're not
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:07.000]  going to do any of that and so then he comes in, he puts really negative policies to try
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:13.160]  to kneecap American energy production and of course that's been a huge driver as to
[1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:19.840]  why we now have gas higher than we have ever seen it before in my lifetime in this country
[1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:27.120]  and so he has facilitated this and I think that's had a huge impact on overall inflation.
[1:34:27.120 --> 1:34:34.640]  Ron DeSantis telling it like it is, telling it like it is and Elon Musk came out and basically
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:39.240]  said he'd like to see Ron DeSantis run for president, he'd vote for him.
[1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:45.720]  Elon Musk also was proud of voting for Mayra Flores on her recent election victory and
[1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:53.240]  this has the left in an absolute uproar but we'll have more on that coming up.
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:58.920]  But yeah, the Democrats, Joe Biden, they are intentionally collapsing the U.S., they are
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:07.920]  intentionally sabotaging our energy, it's an operation from within to destroy our great
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:13.000]  country and I hope they don't succeed.
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:19.240]  Of course I hope they don't succeed but you've noticed some of the signs and the symptoms
[1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:24.040]  of this right now with the record-eyed gas prices, the grocery bill going up, the energy
[1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:29.080]  bill going up, all these other factors and so people are looking and they're realizing
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:34.280]  wow this is actually a lot worse than I thought it would be, Biden is a bigger disaster than
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:43.000]  I thought he would be and so they're trying to make plans if you will for the future just
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:48.080]  not knowing what might come and so a lot more people are realizing boy I should probably
[1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:54.200]  have an emergency food supply considering that under Joe Biden this country might turn
[1:35:54.200 --> 1:35:58.280]  into a third world hellhole like Venezuela, I should probably at least have some emergency

[1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:45.560]  southern border where the Democrats continue to facilitate an invasion by the tens of
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:51.120]  thousands every day and by the multi-millions every year, Allie Bradley is down there reporting
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:56.000]  at the border, she has some latest photos now, they're renting nice beautiful big private
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:01.720]  buses paid for by the taxpayer to shuttle the illegal immigrants all over the country
[1:38:01.720 --> 1:38:05.520]  wherever they may want to go, you're paying for the whole thing, you're paying for your
[1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:10.920]  own invasion, it's really an unbelievable thing actually, it's kind of hard to even
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:14.520]  believe this is going on but it is so outrageous.
[1:38:14.520 --> 1:38:20.120]  The local NGOs are feeling the influx of migrants, Valverde border humanitarian coalition in
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:26.440]  Del Rio had a little help Monday, three charter buses, three DC buses, three shuttle buses,
[1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:33.400]  two Greyhound buses, one great out-of-town volunteer group and yeah, I mean they have
[1:38:33.400 --> 1:38:37.520]  so many illegal immigrants coming in, they don't know what to do with them, yeah they
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:41.040]  can fly them around the country, yeah they can put them up in hotels but they're running
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.520]  out of space in the hotels, they've already filled up all the local Catholic Charity
[1:38:46.520 --> 1:38:51.720]  groups buildings, they can't fit anymore there, they filled up all the hotels in the southern
[1:38:51.720 --> 1:38:56.920]  Texas counties and flying is a bear right now, flying is a pain in the butt so they
[1:38:56.920 --> 1:39:00.040]  can't really fly them anywhere so they're just getting them nice private buses to fly
[1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:06.600]  them wherever they want now, excuse me to drive them wherever they want now, I'm at
[1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:13.880]  a loss on this one, I don't, I just, I cannot understand how this is going on, there's
[1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:20.160]  something real sinister behind this folks, I mean we have an idea I think of what's
[1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:28.480]  going on and we know the agenda but I'm telling you this is so out of control and the lack
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:35.000]  of response, the lack of accountability, the lack of urgency when it comes to the invasion
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:42.160]  at the southern border, this, is everyone involved in this, seriously like is everyone
[1:39:42.160 --> 1:39:47.920]  involved in this, is everyone making money off of this wide open southern border, I can't
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:56.480]  fathom how I can sit here every day and play hours of footage of tens of thousands of
[1:39:56.480 --> 1:40:03.520]  illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border, all paid for, all organized, all orchestrated,
[1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:09.560]  how is that even possible, how can that, where in the hell does that even go on, when has
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:18.680]  that even happened in world history, I'm at a loss folks, I just, I cannot fathom how
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:24.240]  this is really going on and we just sit here and take it, I mean this would be like if
[1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:33.320]  somebody came up to you with like a butcher's knife or a steak knife and stabbed you right
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:41.320]  in the side of your body and you just had a gaping wound bleeding out, someone said hey
[1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.240]  you got a gaping wound there and you said oh really where's that and you looked at it
[1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:48.760]  and then you said hey maybe I should open it up a little wider maybe, maybe you think
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:52.600]  you can help me open this up a little wider and then the person he's saying that to you
[1:40:52.600 --> 1:40:56.680]  was yeah actually I will help, here let me stab you again actually, I mean what, like
[1:40:56.680 --> 1:41:07.040]  how is this even, it's insane man, the southern border situation is insane, insane, three
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:14.360]  US women had fentanyl hidden inside their bodies, border patrol says, so yeah the continuation
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:21.840]  of the deadly fentanyl drug that killed George Floyd, I mean my brother George, my brother,
[1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:28.120]  my brother George Floyd killed by the fentanyl, killed by the open border, George Floyd can
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:34.080]  you believe that, I mean obviously liberals know that, they rioted for an entire summer
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:38.480]  because George Floyd was killed by the fentanyl overdose, oh I'm sorry that's, I'm mistaking
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:42.960]  that was democrat terrorism because they hate police, I'm sorry, I get them confused, I
[1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:47.920]  thought they were rational for a second, no they don't care about George Floyd dying from
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:53.120]  a drug overdose, that doesn't really help them, that doesn't really fit their agenda,
[1:41:53.120 --> 1:42:00.040]  that doesn't really add fuel to their rage, but a policeman killing George Floyd, ooh,
[1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:05.360]  now that they can get behind, they hate the police or the anti-police agenda, that works,
[1:42:05.360 --> 1:42:08.880]  the police officer who happened to be white, they hate white people, so okay that works
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:14.800]  for their anti-white agenda as well, so this is all going good for them and now they can
[1:42:14.800 --> 1:42:20.640]  blame an unarmed black man's death on a white police officer, ching ching ching ching ching
[1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:27.840]  baby, money money money, let's go, burn loot, riot, do it all, but oh if it's George Floyd
[1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:33.280]  dies from fentanyl overdose, well that really doesn't help them does it, there's no agenda
[1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:37.800]  there, fentanyl comes from the wide open southern border that they love so much, a black man
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:45.120]  dying from a drug overdose, they don't want that, jeez, and what happens, the human trafficking,
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:49.480]  multiple victims of human trafficking operation rescued in Akron, Ohio, you think they were
[1:42:49.480 --> 1:43:08.960]  bussed up there, bussed up there in a greyhound to be sex slaves with the open border?

[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:47.920]  wow. Another fire burns down an important facility in America. So now it's not just the
[1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:58.720]  food sector or the fertilizer sector, but the energy sector as well. Very nice. Very good. Fire
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:10.080]  burns it down. All right, everything collapsing in Biden's America. Everything collapsing. And how
[1:48:10.080 --> 1:48:17.120]  are those vaccines going for you? Not so well, not so good. Representative Maxine Waters tests
[1:48:17.120 --> 1:48:26.800]  positive for COVID for a second time this year. It's almost like that vaccine reset your immune
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:33.200]  system and now you don't have one. Maybe that's why she was all bug-eyed and a bug-eyed freak
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:42.400]  in that TV interview. What a psychotic maniac Maxine Waters. Look out. You see here on the streets,
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:51.040]  folks? Look out. Remember, who pays for these cowboys? I mean, this woman is just a dingbat
[1:48:51.040 --> 1:48:57.760]  lunatic claiming that board patrol is whipping people. Well, okay. All right, Maxine, how's
[1:48:57.760 --> 1:49:05.120]  that vaccine working for you? Maxine vaccine COVID two times in a year. FDA advisors recommend
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:12.480]  emergency authorization for Moderna's COVID-19 shot in young kids, six months to five years.
[1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:18.160]  They got to get those young kids blood clotted up. They got to clog up those young kids' arteries.
[1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:23.520]  They got to give those young kids a little guillonne beret. It's not all for Justin and Hailey
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:28.640]  Bieber. After all, you can suffer from blood clots and face paralysis too. Give your kid a COVID
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:36.160]  vaccine shot today. But oh, oh, oh, so it's amazing that we can't figure out what's going on. All these
[1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:42.400]  anomalies directly tied into the vaccine. Here's another one. This is, folks, this is just, it's
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:51.760]  really sad, actually. It's really sad this is being done to children. And you know, I have an
[1:49:51.760 --> 1:50:00.640]  instinct to protect innocent children. And it's something that I can't even really avoid,
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:08.160]  whether it's abortion or whether it's with this vaccine stuff, because I can understand the argument,
[1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:14.000]  the perspective. I can, I can fully comprehend and understand of the people that would say, hey,
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  let them do it. People want to kill their kids. People want to shoot their kids up with poison.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:23.440]  Let them do it, man. Let them do it. None of your business. But while I understand that,
[1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:28.160]  I can't help my instinct to protect innocent children. So this breaks my heart. Children are
[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:34.400]  being infected with up to three viruses at a time because COVID measures have worn down their immune
[1:50:34.400 --> 1:50:41.840]  systems and made them vulnerable to illnesses usually only caught in winter. Health experts
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:45.840]  across the United States have told the Washington Post that they are seeing children with multiple
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:50.960]  viral infections at once. As the weather warms, doctors usually see a decrease in the prevalence
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:55.600]  of influenza and other viruses associated with the common cold. Now some children are arriving
[1:50:55.600 --> 1:51:00.400]  at their doctor's office with three viral infections at the same time. Experts believe that it is a
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:06.160]  result of COVID pandemic policies. Yeah, the vaccine, which meant children were not exposed
[1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:12.000]  to the normal array of viruses. Well, whether it's the vaccines killing their immune system,
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.960]  which we know is going on, or the COVID measures that kept kids locked inside for a year so they
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:25.520]  didn't have a strong immune system, it was the COVID response either way. So that's true.
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:33.440]  True. Now, is it children that are vaccinated? Is it children that are vaccinated having these
[1:51:33.440 --> 1:51:41.760]  problems? Now, here's the other thing about this to me. You know, we do all this COVID testing. Of
[1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:45.120]  course, you're going to have high COVID numbers. Who knows if the test results are real or not.
[1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:51.840]  You could do that with any disease on the planet, I believe. I believe you could do that with any
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:55.840]  disease on the planet. You ramp up, you test everybody. Guess what? You're going to have a
[1:51:55.840 --> 1:52:01.680]  500% increase of that disease just because you tested everybody. So they're testing these kids,
[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:07.200]  but who knows if they always had the virus or it just shows up positive or so. So there's still
[1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:13.280]  kind of some gray area there to me. But what's clear is that kids are getting sicker than they ever
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:20.160]  have. And it is because of the pandemic response, either shutting kids into their houses for a year
[1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:26.800]  or forcing them to take the vaccine that kills their immune system. Kids infected with more
[1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:31.520]  viruses after lockdown due to weakened immune systems. Well, is it the weakened immune system
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:37.440]  because of lockdown? Is it a weakened immune system because of the vaccine? But here's the,
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:45.920]  here's kind of the, I don't know if you would say scary, but the unknown factor here is that
[1:52:45.920 --> 1:52:55.360]  they made COVID-19 in a lab and they released it. So if they're willing to do that and lie about
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:59.600]  that and cover that up, what else are they up to? What else are they releasing that we don't know
[1:52:59.600 --> 1:53:06.880]  about? There's all kinds of unnatural inorganic things that the globalists are doing to this
[1:53:06.880 --> 1:53:12.000]  planet right now that we don't even know about. Yeah, we know about they poison the water. Yeah,
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:15.840]  we know about they poison the air. Yeah, we know about they poison the vaccines. Yeah,
[1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:20.160]  we know about they make viruses in a lab and release them. What else are they doing that we
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:26.080]  don't know about? Yeah, the GMOs and the food. Yeah, okay. I mean, what else is going on? So
[1:53:26.880 --> 1:53:33.040]  stories like this that seem to kind of have the obvious answer, but maybe not so much remind me
[1:53:33.040 --> 1:53:36.880]  that, you know, there's always something else going on that we probably don't even know about.
[1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:40.480]  There's all these globalist operations who knows what they're doing, who knows how many viruses
[1:53:40.480 --> 1:53:45.040]  they've released, who knows what's really going on in the southern border. It's like, yeah, we know
[1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:51.920]  what's going on. What's the story behind the story? Every state but Florida preordered COVID-19
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:58.800]  vaccines for kids under five. Good for Florida. So Florida won't be jabbing their kids to death,
[1:53:58.800 --> 1:54:03.680]  and they'll be the healthiest state. You watch 40 year old British Columbia man diagnosed with
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:08.480]  Guillain-Barre syndrome is awarded compensation for vaccine injury. That's the same thing that
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:13.760]  happened to Justin Bieber, but perhaps a little variation of the same facial paralysis that
[1:54:13.760 --> 1:54:18.720]  happened to Justin Bieber. But he's not allowed to say it's the vaccine because he'll lose his
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:24.320]  record deal, I'm sure. So he just says, oh, maybe I'll be fine. I don't know. They hit you with the
[1:54:24.320 --> 1:54:34.080]  vaccine, Justin. And you know what, Justin? You have made so much money in your life. And you have
[1:54:34.080 --> 1:54:42.800]  a great wife. Why don't you just do the right thing, Justin? Tell people it was the vaccine
[1:54:43.760 --> 1:54:47.920]  that caused you to not be able to perform again. Because what difference does it make
[1:54:47.920 --> 1:54:55.680]  with a record label if you can't perform? What, millions of dollars? You already got millions
[1:54:55.680 --> 1:55:05.040]  of dollars. So maybe there's something else there that we don't know, but I mean, come on. Justin
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:16.480]  Bieber magically gets the second, the second highest rate of vaccine side effect is Guillain-Barre
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:20.560]  syndrome, facial paralysis. Justin Bieber gets that and it's not the vaccine. Give me a break.
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:28.800]  Give me a break. I feel bad for Justin Bieber. But Justin, you've got plenty of money. You don't
[1:55:28.800 --> 1:55:34.400]  need a record label. You've got a wife and everything. Just come out and tell the truth, man.
[1:55:35.920 --> 1:55:42.720]  Just tell the truth. MSN Highlight Survey showing severe COVID-19
[1:55:42.720 --> 1:55:51.040]  rare and unvaccinated after months of safe and effective propaganda. Oh, that's right.
[1:55:51.840 --> 1:55:59.440]  Oh, but see, look, Justin Bieber's concerts forced you to get a vaccine to attend. How ironic.
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:07.680]  But now you can't attend Justin Bieber concerts because of the vaccine. It is just a wild time
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:13.520]  to see reality for what it is, isn't it? But no, back to this story. MSN Highlight Survey showing
[1:56:13.520 --> 1:56:18.400]  severe COVID-19 rare and unvaccinated after months of safe and effective propaganda. Yeah, so it's
[1:56:18.400 --> 1:56:22.560]  the vaccinated that are getting sick. It's the vaccinated that are getting really sick. It's
[1:56:22.560 --> 1:56:28.000]  the vaccinated that are getting sick multiple times and it's the unvaccinated rather non-vaccinated
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:33.520]  that are not getting sick, not having severe effects, not being bedridden for a week,
[1:56:33.520 --> 1:56:38.160]  not needing to go to the hospital, still have an immune system, not having blood clots,
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:45.760]  not having facial paralysis. Sad but true, isn't it? It turned out the people that refused the
[1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:52.000]  vaccine were the smartest people on the planet. And you know, there's that meme. I don't know what
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  you call it. I think there's actual a word for the actual structure of this intellectual hierarchy
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:04.320]  where on the two ends, you have like the lowest level IQ and the highest level IQ, and they typically
[1:57:04.320 --> 1:57:10.480]  seem to be simpatico. They seem to be synced up. And then you have most of the people that are just
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:14.640]  on the on the average end of the IQ spectrum up here, and they're the most brainwashed. They're
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:19.280]  the ones that fall for all the propaganda, do whatever they're told. And then it's the highest IQ
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:24.240]  and the lowest IQ that seem to have the instincts to know when they're being attacked and to know
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:29.520]  when something is wrong. Those are the two groups that avoided the vaccine. And now they're the two
[1:57:29.520 --> 1:57:33.680]  groups that will inherit the earth, the meat shall inherit the earth, as the Bible said. Now,
[1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:38.800]  I feel bad. I don't mean this to be ridiculing of people that have the vaccine that are tuned in.
[1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:43.840]  I don't want to scare you with all the side effects. But I just call it as it is, folks.
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:52.640]  That's what we do here at info wars. The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:57.360]  Jones was right. People ask what's it like to be vindicated? Well, it's actually very sick feeling
[1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:03.760]  because I knew this was coming. I tried to stop it. And now everything I've talked about is going
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:10.320]  to become more important than ever, because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports
[1:58:10.320 --> 1:58:16.400]  and documents. It's now out in the open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth,
[1:58:17.040 --> 1:58:23.040]  the Bilderberg group founded Davos Group. So now the fight's out in the open. They're making
[1:58:23.040 --> 1:58:26.960]  their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing. God's
[1:58:26.960 --> 1:58:30.960]  watching the children counting on us. I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:35.680]  of mouth and your prayer and your financial support, because without you, info wars would not be
[1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:40.960]  here. I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:45.520]  humanity has a fighting chance. So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:50.640]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts. Every single person listening to the sound of my voice
[1:58:51.280 --> 1:58:56.320]  meets to listen to me very, very carefully. The Nestistus have made the most important
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:59:05.440]  documentary in the US history 2000 mules. That's not hype. That's the truth. The film proves how
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:11.360]  the deep state Democrats stole the 2020 election and how they're planning to do it again. Now,
[1:59:11.360 --> 1:59:16.080]  ladies and gentlemen, with all the censorship going on, it is critical to own the DVD with the
[1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:20.400]  expanded extra so you have it in your library so it can't be censored and so you can show it to

[1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:55.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:55.360 --> 2:00:18.080]  We have a mental health crisis in this country that is leading to so many of the other crises,
[2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:27.360]  including sadly some of these mass shootings, if not all of them. It's a mental health problem.
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:35.440]  So gun bills and restricting access to firearm fringing on the Second Amendment is not going
[2:00:35.440 --> 2:00:41.440]  to help and this is from the Texas Tribune. There's never ever, ever enough in rural Texas,
[2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.680]  millions of people in rural Texas who are vulnerable to higher rates of depression,
[2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:52.320]  anxiety and suicide than their urban counterparts have only limited access to patchwork mental
[2:00:52.320 --> 2:01:01.440]  health services. Story headline, Uvaldi was a mental health desert before a school shooting
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:08.400]  prompted Texas to respond with resources. After the May 24th school shooting, mental health help
[2:01:08.400 --> 2:01:14.000]  is now pouring into Uvaldi where a fourth of residents are uninsured and counseling options
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:19.840]  are few and far between. What is going on? Why do we have a mental health crisis and why in children?
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:26.320]  You know, I could sit here and play the political game of left and right and blame
[2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:36.640]  games which will do when it's appropriate and accurate, but this isn't a political partisan
[2:01:36.640 --> 2:01:43.200]  thing to me. This is just a nation problem thing. I don't even know what the source of this problem
[2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:48.000]  would be. I mean, I think their source is all over the place, quite frankly. I think the most
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:53.920]  accurate description would not to be to find the source of the problem, but just to say,
[2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:58.400]  this is a sign of a collapsing nation. This is the sign of a collapsing civilization
[2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:04.400]  when children are anxious, depressed, whatever and they need mental help all day. They need a
[2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:12.560]  psychiatrist. They need a therapist. They need drugs. What is that? That's a new phenomenon.
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:18.720]  That's not normal. That's not traditional. That's never been seen before. This is a new thing.
[2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:25.040]  I don't think drugs are the answer. I don't think psychiatrists are the answer. I think getting
[2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:31.280]  back to life is the answer. Now, maybe there's a problem with these school systems, public school
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:38.720]  systems built and treated like prisons. Maybe there's something wrong with the seven or eight
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:45.680]  hour school day. I mean, this should not be happening. Maybe it's the violent video games,
[2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:48.560]  the violent movies. I'm not sitting here, that's what I'm saying. I'm not sitting here pointing
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:53.120]  fingers saying all the answers, but I mean, this is just to sit here and say, look at how sick our
[2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:57.760]  kids are. Look at how much mental health problems we have. Now, the one thing here could be it's
[2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:03.680]  just extremely exaggerated. I do think there may be an aspect of that, just looking for anything
[2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:11.120]  and everything to publish a story about the Texas shooting. So it could drastically over exaggerate
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:14.480]  the problem. But there's no doubt there is a problem. I forget the story, but it was like
[2:03:15.120 --> 2:03:22.000]  50% of college age males are on some form of antidepressants or SSRI drugs. I mean, that is just
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:28.640]  bombing our civilization with drug abuse. But oh, it's a prescription, so it's good for you.
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:35.840]  No, no, it's probably worse for you, actually. So, but what's the answer? Oh, we just need more.
[2:03:35.840 --> 2:03:40.880]  We need more of this, more that, more gun control, more, more health advocates, more mental health
[2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:46.880]  advocates, more people in school. It's like we just keep going farther and farther away from
[2:03:46.880 --> 2:03:53.040]  normal human life. The more we try to respond to stuff like this and it just makes it worse.
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:58.320]  Lawmakers introduced bill to tax assault weapons 1000%. Oh, so only the rich can have
[2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:04.800]  guns. I see. That's what we want. Lawmaker introduces bill. It's a Democrat bill, of course,
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:10.560]  Don Byer to tax assault weapons 1000%. That way only rich people can have guns.
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:17.280]  That's what the Democrat elitists are all about. Only rich people having guns. So that'll be them.
[2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:21.600]  They'll have guns. They'll have armed security, but they'll defund the place and disarm you.
[2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:26.640]  They just love you so much. These 27 Democrats voted against extra security for Supreme Court
[2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:31.600]  justices. This is one of the weirder things to me. Why are the Supreme Court justices
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:36.000]  lives in danger because of Democrats and Democrat propaganda and Democrat hatred?
[2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:42.560]  And then Democrats, some of them vote to protect the Supreme Court justices that they put in harm.
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.200]  And then others don't vote to protect the Democrat, the Supreme Court justices that
[2:04:47.200 --> 2:04:51.360]  Democrats put in harm's way. And then the ones that do vote, they virtue signal like,
[2:04:51.360 --> 2:04:57.200]  look at how great I am. I voted to protect them. No, you're the one that put them in danger.
[2:04:57.200 --> 2:05:02.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalist hit humanity and hit
[2:05:02.880 --> 2:05:10.160]  humanity extremely hard. It is beyond critical that everyone listening to the sound of my voice
[2:05:10.160 --> 2:05:14.400]  protect yourselves and your families to the greatest extent possible. And these two new

[2:06:29.360 --> 2:06:35.200]  And then Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour. Ladies and gentlemen, we have put together,
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:41.120]  we're very proud of this, an immune support formula package at infowarstore.com.
[2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:48.720]  It's the ultimate immune support pack. It includes survival shield X2. That's the nascent iodine.
[2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:53.600]  Most people are deficient in iodine. So we take care of that with survival shield X2.
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:58.640]  Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium. Again, most people are deficient in vitamin D.
[2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:02.960]  Plus we had the calcium in there. Kids love these gummies, by the way, they taste great.
[2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:07.840]  Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium in there. The immune support formula, we just put together
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.120]  in all natural organic ingredient immune support formula things that are derived from nature that

[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:34.000]  have here. And you know the trend is to stop Asian hate, right? Everybody knows about the
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:40.400]  stop Asian hate trend that we've been seeing except all of a sudden it went away because it wasn't
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:45.920]  being done by white people. And so all of a sudden the liberals and the media didn't care about
[2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:51.120]  stopping Asian hate anymore when they couldn't blame it on white people. But here's a nice,
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:59.280]  fresh example of some of the Asian hate from a non whitey. And boy, oh boy, is this one fun here.
[2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:08.880]  She's not so bright. She hates Asians. And here she is. But we'll see if this one makes the stop
[2:09:08.880 --> 2:09:16.720]  Asian hate brigade trend in clip six. Hey, Orlando, Florida, I'd like you to meet someone.
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:22.400]  You're a Chinese bitch, not me. Okay, I got that camera. I got that camera calling me back.
[2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:27.040]  You're a Chinese bitch. Okay, thank you. You want me to spell it for you? You're a Chinese bitch.
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:30.400]  Okay, thank you. Can you stop? Okay, I have her on camera saying that.
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:34.720]  Who the fuck? Bitch, call the police. What they going to do? You're casting in front of them,
[2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:41.440]  you're a Chinese bitch. Now what? We can trust Pat to you. Bitch. Try and try and try and try and
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:46.640]  try and try and try and try. Okay, you're going on Facebook. It is dumb to spew racial hate at
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:51.120]  someone who is recording you with their phone. But you know what's even dumber? To do that to
[2:09:51.120 --> 2:09:55.520]  someone as you're paying for your food and then wait around for the person you just insulted
[2:09:56.080 --> 2:09:59.600]  to make and give you your food, because that's what she did.
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:12.880]  And you know what's even dumber than that.
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:17.440]  Paying for your food with a debit card that not only has your name on it,
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:24.800]  it also has the name of your business. So, not the best move, Liz Nighton,
[2:10:24.800 --> 2:10:30.880]  owner of Body Beauty Bar in Orlando. She also allegedly went home and then left two nasty
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:35.360]  reviews for the business making up stories that didn't happen. So apparently she's fine with
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:40.720]  people going to say a business and writing bad reviews that never took place. Although I can
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:45.200]  imagine what further damage that could do. Her current Better Business Bureau rating is an F,
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:48.880]  including several very legitimate sounding complaints that were reported long before
[2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:53.520]  this video was made, including one claiming that she likes to take money and then not provide the
[2:10:53.520 --> 2:10:59.200]  services. That's not great, Liz, but I can finish this on a positive note. The place she was at,
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:06.160]  King Cajun, Orlando, Mills 50, looks absolutely amazing. Their food looks incredible.
[2:11:06.160 --> 2:11:09.440]  And it looks like they're about to open an additional location in Daytona Beach.
[2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:13.600]  So I think the next time I'm in Orlando, I'm going to have to stop by and try them for myself.
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:20.480]  And I hope to not see you there, Liz. You think that's going to make the old stop Asian hate
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:31.520]  theater? No, somehow I doubt it. Also, I'd be willing to make quite a significant bet
[2:11:32.240 --> 2:11:39.840]  that that lady is a Democrat. I have a feeling I know what she would say if I asked her how she
[2:11:39.840 --> 2:11:46.160]  felt about Donald Trump. Yeah, I think it's pretty obvious, isn't it? Oh, liberals, they're
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:53.280]  everywhere and their hatred just overwhelms them. Really just incredible stuff, sad stuff. But there
[2:11:53.280 --> 2:12:03.280]  it is. Let me do this right now as well. Incredible footage of a police officer in Naperville. This
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:14.480]  is outside of Chicago. And guys, I'll pitch to the video here. But so this police officer is
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:21.360]  dealing with a traffic stop. The guy is delaying and he's dealing with them for now more than
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:26.640]  10 minutes. And he obviously called up a friend of his to, I guess, come assault the officer.
[2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:33.760]  And so here it is. Guy pulls up in a vehicle, police. Okay, what's going on? Guys, give me
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:36.720]  the audio here. Does this want to have audio or I guess the doc cam doesn't have audio? We'll go
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:44.160]  to body cam. So he runs out. Oh, there it is. So he runs out to try to. Yeah, here's the body cam.
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:47.840]  Watch this. At this point at the traffic stop, the officer has been on scene with the driver
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.240]  for more than 11 minutes. When a guy pulls up to try to hatch at him.
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:04.320]  All right, take a picture and send it to me.
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:27.040]  All right, so there you go. There you see it. And I mean, obviously, folks,
[2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:32.000]  the problem here is the the hatchet. I mean, that hatchet was out of control.
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.560]  I mean, that poor innocent man was taken advantage of by a radical hatchet.
[2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:46.160]  He comes out of the car. He's got his hatchet. And he tries to attack the police officer with it.
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:51.040]  And he doesn't make it more than three steps before the officer puts him down.
[2:13:51.760 --> 2:13:57.840]  Down goes the hatchet, man. Oh, I'm sure it's the hatchets to blame. We should probably ban hatchets.
[2:13:57.840 --> 2:14:05.920]  And disarm police and ban hatchets. That's the answer here. Pretty incredible stuff there,
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:10.720]  isn't it? Pretty amazing stuff. Police officers are the ones that get attacked and
[2:14:13.040 --> 2:14:16.160]  demonized and everything. And look, I've had plenty of problem with cops over the years.
[2:14:16.160 --> 2:14:19.920]  I still have plenty of problems with bad cops. I have more of a problem, I think with the law
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:27.360]  than I do individual police officers. But that's what police deal with all the time.
[2:14:28.400 --> 2:14:38.320]  And they just get hate, sadly, when they put those criminals down. That's what they do.
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:41.840]  All right, I'm going to give out the phone number now. We'll start aggregating calls.
[2:14:41.840 --> 2:14:45.280]  I'll probably take calls in the last two segments that I'm with you here today.
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:50.720]  I'm going to do a news blitz in the next segment. But anything I've covered so far today is fair
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:15:00.160]  game. 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. Anything we've covered so far today is fair game.
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:03.040]  I'm going to come back in the next segment. I'm going to do a news blitz, try to get the
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.880]  rest of this news off my desk, and then we will take phone calls until Paul Joseph Watson takes
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:16.880]  over. But of course, remember folks, infowarstore.com is how everything we do here is possible,
[2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:22.400]  including the great crew. Did you hear about this one, though, as we go to break? DC Star
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:27.920]  kidnaps teenager and vanishes authorities continue searching. You probably, I've covered this
[2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:32.320]  Ezra Miller story before. You know, they say you can't make it in Hollywood these days without
[2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:37.280]  being a liberal or a pedophile. Lucky for them, most of them are the same. You knock both those
[2:15:37.280 --> 2:15:43.200]  birds out with each one. But now this guy, after allegedly abusing these teenage girls,
[2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:50.880]  now has kidnapped them and is missing. Man, that is some wacky, wild stuff there.
[2:15:50.880 --> 2:16:06.720]  I don't think he'll be playing flash in the next movie.
[2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:40.720]  I don't think he'll be playing flash in the next movie.
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:17:01.040]  Let's go ahead and take another call. Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee. Welcome.
[2:17:01.040 --> 2:17:05.280]  Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm. All right, I will make this quick and real short where the other
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.720]  Patriots can get on the line. Alex, I have to promote one thing from one of your co-hosts, Owen
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:16.640]  Shroyer. Supermail volatility and brain force plus. Mix those two together. You're an unstoppable
[2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:22.160]  tank. Supermail volatility really, really works. It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:28.320]  that have never been heated up. And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions
[2:17:28.320 --> 2:17:33.520]  that also work quite well, but just aren't as strong. This is like a very fine wine. In fact,
[2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:37.360]  each batch is different. Sometimes it's super strong. Sometimes it's just okay. People are like,
[2:17:37.360 --> 2:17:40.800]  why are you selling something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong? That's just how
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:46.720]  it is. It's how it works. So it's always good. It's just sometimes it's like super strong. But
[2:17:46.720 --> 2:18:02.640]  yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price, then this is it. PrepareToday.com. PrepareToday.com,

[2:18:56.720 --> 2:19:00.640]  You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:04.640]  and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is going to level
[2:19:04.640 --> 2:19:07.760]  the playing field. Everybody's going to have access to the same information and everybody's
[2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:12.720]  going to be able to freely communicate that information. That's our goal, to get back to
[2:19:12.720 --> 2:19:18.400]  that place where we all have access to all of the information. We all have the ability to freely
[2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:23.840]  communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want, and we don't have to worry
[2:19:23.840 --> 2:19:30.320]  about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some
[2:19:30.320 --> 2:19:35.920]  way to go after us because of the conversations we're having, because of the internet searches
[2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:41.280]  that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[2:19:41.280 --> 2:19:46.080]  So that's our goal, is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their
[2:19:46.080 --> 2:19:51.200]  privacy. And so that's really what we're trying to do. And so I hope that everybody listening
[2:19:51.200 --> 2:20:06.000]  will check us out at boltowireless.com. That's B-O-L-T-A-Wireless.com.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:23.680]  Constraints that COVID has played. Look, we have the warner off. We have COVID, which has
[2:20:26.400 --> 2:20:32.240]  really constraints that COVID has played. Look, we have the warner off. We have COVID, which has
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:39.120]  really constraints that COVID has played. Look, we have the warner off.
[2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:46.560]  Geez. Another geriatric mush mouth corrupt criminal Democrat, Nancy Pelosi. She can't even
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:52.320]  talk right. By the way, she's up there wearing a Ukrainian badge, wearing a Ukrainian bracelet,
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:59.920]  wearing Ukraine colors, and then she says the war in Iraq. She's gone. Why are we still dealing
[2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:10.400]  with these geriatric old criminal fools like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden? Oh, God. I can, you know,
[2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:14.400]  I just, the day that we don't have to deal with these criminals anymore, the day this country
[2:21:14.400 --> 2:21:18.720]  rid itself of the Democrat party, folks, we are going to see so much prosperity, such a boom of
[2:21:18.720 --> 2:21:25.280]  life and love and happiness and rejuvenation of the American way of life and just everything
[2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:29.120]  that comes with it. It's going to be awesome, man. We're going to do it. It's not going to be,
[2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:32.880]  it's not going to be easy. It's going to be difficult. There's going to be a lot of crossroads
[2:21:32.880 --> 2:21:37.600]  and a lot of obstacles, but we're going to do it. I really believe so. I hope I'm alive to witness it,
[2:21:37.600 --> 2:21:42.160]  but we're going to defeat the evil globalists. We're going to defeat the corporate world government
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:46.880]  and we're going to rid ourselves of the biggest scourge in the history of this nation,
[2:21:46.880 --> 2:21:51.360]  the Democrat party. And we're going to start to see life and love and liberty and the pursuit
[2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:56.720]  of happiness and prosperity combined like we have never seen in this country. And it's going to be
[2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:04.160]  incredible, but we got to get those maggots. We have to get these maggots like Nancy Pelosi out
[2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:11.360]  of our way, who wears the Ukrainian colors and bracelet and lapel pen and then says it's the
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:19.520]  war in Iraq. Wow. All right. Let's do a news blitz here before we start to take phone calls.
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:24.640]  Joe Biden shatters all records of migrants entering the United States at open southern border.
[2:22:24.640 --> 2:22:30.800]  Yeah, it's three million a year now pouring in and you're paying for all of it. Isn't that nice?
[2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:36.720]  Don't you love having a wide open border and getting replaced by people that come here for free
[2:22:36.720 --> 2:22:42.240]  the illegal way? Yeah. Mail-in ballots found scattered along local San Diego freeway. Oh,
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:47.840]  I'm sure nothing to find there. A California man found several mail-in ballots on the freeway near
[2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:54.960]  San Diego last week. Just some boxes of mail-in ballots. I don't know if somebody called a local
[2:22:54.960 --> 2:22:59.680]  Democrat party. They may be missing some ballots. Hey, Democrats, we found your ballots in case
[2:22:59.680 --> 2:23:08.000]  you're missing them. Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says, I don't think the Department
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:16.160]  of Education should exist. Wow. Bow, Queen. I love somebody that works for the government that has
[2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:22.000]  disdain for the government. That's the kind of government worker I like, one that has distrust
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:29.200]  and disdain even for the very government it works for, like Betsy DeVos. Too true, Betsy,
[2:23:29.200 --> 2:23:35.280]  the Department of Education shouldn't exist. I agree. I'd start to shut this government down
[2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:42.880]  quicker than you could even imagine. Oh boy, the left is really mad at Elon Musk. He voted for
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:49.440]  Myra Flores. He wants Ron DeSantis to run. So the left is just all up in a tizzy because they don't
[2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:55.200]  like him. Here's Jamal Bowman, a Democrat from New York. He's a real piece of trash. Elon Musk is
[2:23:55.200 --> 2:24:02.160]  not a leader. He's just another Republican billionaire who supports white supremacy
[2:24:02.160 --> 2:24:07.040]  and authoritarianism because he doesn't want his workers to unionize or to pay his fair share in
[2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:15.040]  taxes. Oh, and there it is. Here come the tropes against Elon Musk. The GOP just tried to end
[2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:19.440]  democracy and now he's supporting them. The GOP tried to end democracy. The Democrats are the
[2:24:19.440 --> 2:24:23.920]  ones that cheat all day. We all know that. They don't even want you to have voter ID. Why do you
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:27.840]  think that is? They have illegal immigrants coming here and voting for them. Why do you think that
[2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:35.040]  is? They don't want an audit of the 2020 election. Why do you think that is? Should I go on Jamal
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:40.720]  Bowman? What an absolute scum human. They're mad at Elon Musk because they can't control him.
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:45.120]  That's what it really comes down to. They want to control the billionaire class,
[2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:51.040]  like the Bill Gates and the Jeff Bezos of the world. And when they can't control Elon Musk,
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:56.720]  that makes them mad. Democrats like to control your life. They like to control you. And if they
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:03.760]  can't, they get mad. By the way, guys, see if you can find this. I'm sorry. I meant to print it.
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:08.800]  Elon Musk was talking about this the other day. There's all of these government incentive programs
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:16.320]  to get people to buy electric vehicles. And so you can go out. In fact, it's such a crime,
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:22.400]  actually, what Obama did. If you go out and buy a car, you have to pay a gas guzzler tax. I think
[2:25:22.400 --> 2:25:27.360]  it's like five grand or something. Obama put that tax on the books. You buy a combustion engine.
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:31.920]  You're paying a tax for it. It's called the gas guzzler tax. Total criminal activity. Thanks,
[2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:38.800]  Barack. But they also did an incentive where they give you, like, a thousand or two thousand or
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:48.080]  five thousand cash back if you buy an electric vehicle. But here's the thing. They didn't give
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:56.320]  that to Tesla. All the other motor companies got that advantage, that cash back incentive to buy
[2:25:56.320 --> 2:26:05.920]  an electric vehicle except Tesla. Why is that, I wonder? They really don't like Elon Musk,
[2:26:05.920 --> 2:26:11.120]  which just makes me like him all the more. FAA requires SpaceX to make environmental adjustments
[2:26:11.120 --> 2:26:15.280]  to move forward with its Starship program in Texas. Yeah, government getting an Elon Musk's away
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:20.640]  again. Government always getting in your way, always wanting to run your life and control you.
[2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:26.960]  I'm sick of government quite personally. Democrats love government because it's a tool of control.
[2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:32.640]  It's a source of power for them and their lust for control and power in your life.
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:40.960]  Here's a perplexing one. Murder, suicide, murder, suicides by pilots are vexing airlines
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:48.000]  as deaths mount. And this is really in the aftermath of a story in China. And it's funny
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:52.720]  because I remember seeing this and thinking it had to be intentional. And they said it was a mistake,
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:57.040]  but then they admitted no, it was a murder, suicide, where you have these airline pilots
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:27:02.320]  literally nose diving into the ocean and into the mountains. And it's like, what?
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:08.320]  So this is just a perplexing one here, folks.
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:15.520]  Murder, suicides by pilots, vexing airlines as deaths mount. Now, I know what some of you
[2:27:15.520 --> 2:27:19.920]  were probably thinking. I don't know. Maybe it is a vaccine thing, but I don't necessarily see
[2:27:19.920 --> 2:27:25.120]  that here for sure. That's a new one. That's interesting. Fortunes of crypto billionaires
[2:27:25.120 --> 2:27:31.200]  are melting with Bitcoin crash. Everything's crashing in the Biden economy. And of course,
[2:27:31.200 --> 2:27:35.200]  all those people that told you to invest in Bitcoin, it's the be all end all. It'll solve
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:38.960]  every problem on the planet. And then you lost your money and they made a lot of money with
[2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:45.520]  corporate crypto sponsorships. So they didn't mind. But you lost all your money. They didn't
[2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:49.920]  tell you there was a risk involved. But yeah, it's just everything's collapsing under Biden.
[2:27:50.960 --> 2:27:58.000]  Here's an interesting one. Obama to install 2500 gallon commercial grade propane tank for
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:03.520]  Martha's Vineyard estate. So Obama, who says that sea levels are going to kill us all
[2:28:03.520 --> 2:28:12.720]  and then buys multiple beachfront mansions. Is he preparing for a apocalypse 2500 gallon
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:20.640]  propane tank for Obama? What is he preparing for the apocalypse? That is a pretty, pretty odd one
[2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:27.200]  right there. Savage monster accused of decapitating pregnant ex girlfriend and throwing head in a
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:34.880]  dumpster. Wow. Wow. Must be some of that might mighty white supremacy. No exact opposite actually.

[2:28:57.360 --> 2:29:03.760]  better one saying that's thousands of years old. And it goes like this. Trust in God, but tie up
[2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:09.520]  your camel. Hunter s Thompson put it this way. Pray to God, but roll away from the rocks. If your
[2:29:09.520 --> 2:29:14.480]  boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him and killed. But also
[2:29:14.480 --> 2:29:18.320]  try to roll away. You can't just sit there like a jellyfish. And it's the same thing with our

[2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:34.880]  I apologize to callers on the line we're gonna have to preempt your calls here and so I just
[2:33:34.880 --> 2:33:38.800]  want to explain this to the callers on the line we're gonna be joined by Alex Jones any minute
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:44.720]  now and then in the next segment Pete Santilli as well with Alex so I apologize to callers on
[2:33:44.720 --> 2:33:49.280]  the line but Alex is going to be joining us here any moment now so I'm not going to be able to take
[2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:56.160]  calls so instead I'll just do a news coverage here until we are joined by Alex. This is a story
[2:33:56.160 --> 2:33:59.760]  that is not hitting much coverage in the media but you need to understand something about it
[2:34:00.400 --> 2:34:06.320]  because I think it's going to come back to the front pretty soon that's the lower food lower
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:12.640]  food and fuel costs bill which was proposed more than a month ago by Biden and the Democrats
[2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:19.920]  and I think it's it's starting to get new life again US rep Angie Craig applauds lower food
[2:34:19.920 --> 2:34:24.880]  and fuel costs act as it's about to get to the floor to a vote now here's what you need to understand
[2:34:24.880 --> 2:34:31.920]  about this they want to lower the fuel costs is really what they're trying to do here by
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:40.240]  putting more ethanol out there which is using a corn in fuel folks this is not going to lower the
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:47.200]  price of gasoline and it's going to raise the price of food what do you think happens when
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:53.360]  you're no longer using that corn for food not just for for people to eat but for livestock to eat
[2:34:54.880 --> 2:35:01.680]  so the lower food and fuel cost act is going to not lower the price of gas and it's going to increase
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:14.480]  the price of food our leaders are clowns our leaders are clowns oh it's so frustrating
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:21.040]  it is so frustrating los angeles soft on crime district attorney george gascon
[2:35:21.600 --> 2:35:25.120]  blamed for the death of two police officers this week yeah another criminal that gascon
[2:35:25.120 --> 2:35:29.680]  lets out of jail goes out and commits another murder it's typical in democrat cities they
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:33.680]  released the criminals from jail oh but then they tell you about january 6 and they tell you about
[2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:37.440]  people that need to be in jail for the rest of their lives and never committed a crime never
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:42.400]  heard a fly but oh actual hardened murderers and rapists and criminals and democrats let them out
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:49.040]  on the street to rape and murder again no problem no problem nothing to see here nothing to see here
[2:35:49.040 --> 2:35:53.680]  all right the uh the left is coming for lauren bobert because she tells the truth and that
[2:35:53.680 --> 2:36:00.880]  angers democrats now so they tried to do a hit piece on her yesterday liberals rushed to spread
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:06.480]  bogus lauren bobert escort and abortion rumors they found some pictures of i guess a hooker
[2:36:07.520 --> 2:36:12.400]  on the internet that apparently bragged about abortions and they said it was lauren bobert it
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:20.320]  wasn't she's also looking at lawsuits for defamation in regards to this we'll see the luck has there
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.800]  she's not a democrat so it's a lot harder to win cases like that only democrats win those cases it
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:31.440]  seems but uh here was here's what i found funny about this this is will somner shared the daily
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:36.960]  beast story that i just had the headline and this is hilarious let's see if you guys catch on
[2:36:36.960 --> 2:36:43.120]  let's see if you guys catch on here from will somner sharing the lauren bobert story i'm sorry
[2:36:43.120 --> 2:36:52.240]  but the viral lauren bobert escort and abortion story is obviously fake yes will like everything
[2:36:52.240 --> 2:37:02.000]  else you liberals believe russian collusion russian propaganda hunter biden's laptop isn't real
[2:37:02.800 --> 2:37:09.280]  should we go on safe and effective should we go on do we need to go on
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:15.680]  on i'm sorry but the lauren bobert escort and abortion story is obviously fake says liberal
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:25.520]  will sommer uh yeah everything you guys believe is fake and not only fake obviously fake everything
[2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:34.720]  you guys believe is obviously fake not just the lauren bobert story everything every story just
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:46.400]  see small at everything liberals believe is obviously fake you just figured it out one time
[2:37:46.400 --> 2:37:52.400]  you're one for your whole life you figured it out with lauren bobert's story there now i'm not the
[2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:58.000]  guy obsessed with race because i'm not a racist bigot liberal democrat they're the racist bigot
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:05.280]  bigots in this country so i but i'm pretty sure that clarence thomas is the only uh black supreme
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:11.600]  court justice for now i don't i don't think um the pedophile judge the pedophile supporting
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:17.280]  judge has has officially been put in her place yet so so as of now i believe it's clarence thomas
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:23.600]  is the only one so why are democrats trying to remove him from the from the bench msnbc the case
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:29.840]  for impeaching justice clarence thomas now guess what their case is their case is that his wife
[2:38:30.400 --> 2:38:35.680]  is a trump supporter that's their case they don't like his wife they don't like his wife telling
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:39.920]  it like it is they don't like his wife that doesn't trust the 2020 election results they don't like
[2:38:39.920 --> 2:38:44.560]  his wife that likes donald trump and so they want to remove clarence thomas because they don't like
[2:38:44.560 --> 2:38:52.800]  his wife you democrats are sick people you all belong in mental institutions maybe we i hope
[2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:56.800]  maybe we should just send you all to mars since you hate this planet so much maybe you'll like it on
[2:38:56.800 --> 2:39:01.520]  mars maybe you can find a way to destroy mars that'd be a challenge so i'd actually like to see
[2:39:01.520 --> 2:39:07.840]  democrats i challenge democrats to try to destroy mars like they've destroyed america that's a
[2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:13.200]  challenge for them that would be an interesting challenge let's see democrats try to destroy
[2:39:13.200 --> 2:39:17.440]  mars but so they want to remove clarence thomas from the bench because they don't like his politics
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:21.360]  they don't like his wife he's the only black justice on there right now so wow i guess that
[2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:26.480]  would mean democrats are racist but we all knew that here's more proof this is a democrat professor
[2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:34.080]  at cal state attention white people uh this is professor melina abdulla cal state attention
[2:39:34.080 --> 2:39:40.560]  white people please do not ask if you can come to the cookout juneteenth is freedom day for black
[2:39:40.560 --> 2:39:47.920]  folks it should be reparation day for white folks uh spoken like a true hardcore bigot she must be a
[2:39:47.920 --> 2:39:57.200]  liberal democrat and she is she's also a professor now i'd love to see the logic of individuals who
[2:39:57.200 --> 2:40:05.840]  have never been slaves getting paid by individuals who have never owned slaves for slavery that's
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:12.320]  called liberal logic might also be called a mental disorder because it is but it's even more absurd
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:18.320]  than that because they'll say oh what about your ancestors okay so you're gonna have people whose
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:23.360]  ancestors that have never been slaved being paid off by people whose ancestors who have never had
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:29.120]  slaves so as you see the logic still plays out it's still the same logic because when logic can be
[2:40:29.120 --> 2:40:37.840]  applied universally it's logic when logic cannot be applied universally it's propaganda that's why
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:44.160]  liberal logic is so frustrating because it's not logic it's propaganda and here's some more of it
[2:40:44.160 --> 2:40:50.000]  this is hilarious opinion it's about damn time we got a celebrity apology like lizzo so lizzo
[2:40:50.000 --> 2:40:56.880]  writes a song about how she likes to fight and shoot people and chop men's penises off not even
[2:40:56.880 --> 2:41:04.560]  kidding you she writes a song about how she likes to fight people and chop men's penises off
[2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:11.760]  but there's a lyric in her song girls that's all about chopping men's penises off and fighting
[2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:19.840]  in the club but there's a lyric in there it goes do you see this beep i'm a spaz i'm about to knock
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:28.000]  somebody out she the only one here let me just read some of these lyrics here for you i'm a spaz
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:38.480]  i'm about to knock somebody out we throw them we throwing them bows let's eff it up that's the
[2:41:38.480 --> 2:41:45.440]  type of fight i'm looking for let me take these earrings off and hit the boozy ratchet with my
[2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:52.640]  friends i'm gonna go lorraine a bobbin on him so he can never beep again now you can't beep again
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:57.040]  and it goes on the same stuff in the song now of all those lyrics which one do you think was
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:03.040]  offensive and which one do you think lizzo was apologizing for the part where she talks about
[2:42:03.040 --> 2:42:08.640]  chopping men's penises off or fighting in the club promoting the violence no it was spaz
[2:42:10.080 --> 2:42:19.760]  spaz because apparently spaz is ableist i'm not even kidding you lizzo apologizes for ableist
[2:42:19.760 --> 2:42:28.080]  lyrics using the word spaz because there's some disorder called spastic something and so she
[2:42:28.080 --> 2:42:33.680]  used spaz and she apologized because someone sent her a message saying i have spastic disorder
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:38.720]  i'm offended uh but not at her chopping off men's penises or fighting in the club or all of her
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:48.240]  other uh disgusting smut that she puts out it was the word spaz that did it uh liberals put
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:52.160]  him in the mental institutions and watch everything else work itself out

[2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:18.960]  lots of big breaking developing news you're not going to find it covered anywhere else like right
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:27.360]  here on the alex joneshow and alex jones joins us on the phone now uh i'm not even sure what alex
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:31.920]  is breaking right now he's about to be joined by pete sandtilly as well so uh alex i'm uh
[2:47:31.920 --> 2:47:38.320]  i'm waiting here on the edge of my sheet to know what the big news is well i was told about this
[2:47:38.320 --> 2:47:43.040]  from some of the inside sources for some of the more well-known defendants that have been charged
[2:47:43.680 --> 2:47:50.320]  with the seditious conspiracy uh situation and they knew that the committee was swearing people
[2:47:50.320 --> 2:47:55.520]  in acting like it was a real hearing under law which it is and then when they were having witnesses
[2:47:55.520 --> 2:48:00.800]  in the room to listen to other witnesses and when they'd already pre-coached them that is
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:06.400]  completely illegal that's how you rig a trial uh anyone even if they were an axmer would have to
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:11.440]  be released uh from from from jail and charges dropped uh whenever things like this happen this
[2:48:11.440 --> 2:48:17.120]  is just one oh one that you do not do this and it's the same thing with democrats doing civil
[2:48:17.120 --> 2:48:22.320]  cases and criminal cases all over the united states uh they're they're doing in canada
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:28.880]  uh as well they have weaponized the judiciary so i was told about this on monday and tuesday
[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:32.560]  because they were clearly just violating the law out in front of the whole world not just tainting
[2:48:32.560 --> 2:48:38.720]  the jury pool but but saying people were convicted airing edited tapes falsified evidence of violating
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:42.880]  the rule of completeness where if you show a clip you've got to show it in context or show basically
[2:48:42.880 --> 2:48:47.600]  the whole clip or most the clip so it's a two-hour show you got to show 15 minutes of it if it's a
[2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:52.640]  five minute clip you got to show four minutes of it you got to show at least the majority of it
[2:48:52.640 --> 2:48:56.720]  instead of edited tapes similar to what shiff already did three times in the committee editing
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:02.560]  emails to say completely false things about trump and others and so we have cnn pieces saying i'm
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:08.320]  guilty uh cnn pieces saying that i that that that that i basically commanded the attack on the capital
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:13.920]  uh we've got that piece coming up next segment and so whether whether joe biggs is guilty or not
[2:49:13.920 --> 2:49:17.600]  whether sure roads is guilty or not and i don't believe they're guilty of seditious conspiracy
[2:49:17.600 --> 2:49:22.000]  that they go in the capital would a democrat maybe get a trip to jail and out in two hours for that
[2:49:22.000 --> 2:49:27.360]  yeah so maybe jail for two hours and then out in two hours you know if it's a equally applied
[2:49:27.360 --> 2:49:31.360]  justice system certainly not seditious conspiracy and they certainly were being commanded by me
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:35.520]  or trump or anybody else that's why i was there trying to stop people going to the capital in
[2:49:35.520 --> 2:49:40.320]  the same cnn piece that they did covering the hearings and how i'm a dangerous extremist
[2:49:40.320 --> 2:49:45.280]  they said that i was there encouraging people to go into the capital and they show footage without
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:50.240]  audio of me saying don't go in the capital it'll be a new kent stay you'll get shot you'll get
[2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:56.240]  killed so these people are absolute criminals the committee list shaney all of them are working
[2:49:56.240 --> 2:50:00.560]  in concert with the control corporate press and so the big announcement that pete has here and i
[2:50:00.560 --> 2:50:05.040]  was told this two days ago talked to some folks last night confirmed it but he talked to the
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:09.440]  same people obviously but at that uh that are very close to case and those filings are happening
[2:50:09.440 --> 2:50:15.200]  within hours to say you have to let all of these people that you showed in the committee with edited
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:20.400]  tapes uh because you had witnesses in the same room that are going to be called in the criminal
[2:50:20.400 --> 2:50:24.320]  case and you had witnesses in there listening to the other witnesses because you've done this on
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:29.440]  purpose to put out your fake narrative to take the whole world's mind everybody has to be released
[2:50:29.440 --> 2:50:35.760]  now and again better than a hundred guilty men go free that one innocent man go to jail well
[2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:40.560]  these people are innocent of what they've claimed it's a total fraud and we are truly in a banana
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:45.120]  republic rig kangaroo court show trial system and this is the case the same thing's happening with
[2:50:45.120 --> 2:50:48.800]  my sandy hook cases that are designed here or the first amendment democrats have bragged about this
[2:50:48.800 --> 2:50:54.480]  on national television and said now that we're going to be able to shut alex jones down they think
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:51:01.200]  we'll be able to basically shut everybody else down so so so that's the precedent defaulting me
[2:51:01.200 --> 2:51:04.400]  saying we didn't give them all the stuff they asked for which is a lie didn't say they're
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:09.280]  going to have a jury trial on how guilty i am but we're not supposed to be able to even talk
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:14.400]  at these upcoming show trials that begin in late july i'm not putting myself in the middle of the
[2:51:14.400 --> 2:51:18.960]  story i'm explaining this is part of concerted effort the suits against trump uh the criminal
[2:51:18.960 --> 2:51:24.000]  investigations against trump all the things that are being done against the rest of the independent
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:28.240]  media all the different lawsuits being followed against independent media is an attempt to shut
[2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:33.520]  everybody down and so we are all having our rights taken right now this is a blueprint for all of
[2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:39.600]  america as tucker carlson said just love on monday of this week he said this is a blueprint to to
[2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:44.480]  criminalize the political opposition to the democratic party in america because the democratic
[2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:48.320]  party has lost everybody hates them there's a political realignment against them so this is
[2:51:48.320 --> 2:51:52.800]  their last desperate gamble but they even had to cancel one of the day's hearings because the
[2:51:52.800 --> 2:51:56.320]  ratings are so low and no one's buying it and people are getting very angry at him so pete
[2:51:56.320 --> 2:52:01.920]  centel he's got the specifics here this is exclusive coming down today multiple defendants
[2:52:01.920 --> 2:52:07.280]  multiple group filings uh demanding that they be released uh because the entire system of
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:14.080]  due process has been violated in royal flush spades pete centeli uh thank you alex uh
[2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:20.160]  that's right it is uh this is exclusive i've gotten word now uh it's imminent uh within
[2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:26.240]  hours there will be a filing on behalf of all of the um january six defendants i'm sure all of
[2:52:26.240 --> 2:52:32.160]  them will join in but a group uh is going to be doing a filing in mass and let me just tell you
[2:52:33.360 --> 2:52:39.680]  how egregious these these violations are they're basic fundamental constitutional violations
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:45.840]  if you go read the sixth amendment uh due process violations you're supposed to uh to have an
[2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:51.680]  adequate defense uh of course um representation by your attorney but let me tell you what's
[2:52:51.680 --> 2:52:59.920]  happened here i believe that um uh that liz halliburton cheney uh is is so psychotically
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:06.240]  zealous towards getting president trump that she essentially destroyed any possibility of a fair
[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:11.840]  trial now let me tell you uh that there's legal precedents here uh ollie north i think was back
[2:53:11.840 --> 2:53:20.480]  in 1991 was convicted and the way he was convicted was after he was forced to give testimony uh in
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:26.880]  the iran contra committee hearings uh he asserted his fifth amendment right they compelled him to
[2:53:26.880 --> 2:53:32.160]  give testimony and then by doing so they brought him to trial although they uh they offered him
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:38.000]  immunity uh they withhold withheld that brought him to trial and he was convicted as a result of
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:44.400]  that conviction they appealed it and on appeal almost identical to the circumstances here in the
[2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:52.000]  january six hearings um is that basically the jury pool was tainted another thing alex jones uh
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:58.320]  he's not a defendant but i'll give you an example of how the jury pool was tainted um this marcus
[2:53:58.320 --> 2:54:05.200]  children's he's a an officer of the court an attorney he doctored evidence and lined up a video
[2:54:05.200 --> 2:54:11.200]  creating a certain impression that essentially is irreversible you what they say is you cannot
[2:54:11.200 --> 2:54:16.080]  unring a bell so this bell has been rung in two hearings i mentioned this too
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:21.840]  oh in the other day uh that there are blessings in disguise here either getting caught doctoring
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:29.760]  evidence uh giving just horrifying a testimony without any cross examination or challenging
[2:54:29.760 --> 2:54:34.480]  of anything that they're presenting this is so egregious that i'm gonna i'm gonna make the
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:40.640]  call right now there is a strong possibility that the defendants that are locked up in the gulag
[2:54:40.640 --> 2:54:47.200]  could literally walk not just walk out the door uh but also have all their charges dropped a mist
[2:54:47.200 --> 2:54:53.200]  trial before the trial even begins and p let me just add this anywhere else in america in michigan
[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:58.240]  where the jury said no these people are not guilty in the fake widmer kidnapping false flag event
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:03.680]  you're absolutely right or in texas or even in a place like new york or florida or or even california
[2:55:03.680 --> 2:55:09.440]  but dc has such rig courts and such rig systems on record you know we just saw that with the
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:13.280]  sussman verdict where he's caught right handed nothing happens because he works for hillary
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:18.000]  uh these judges may just go ahead and say no we don't care they can do anything and that sets
[2:55:18.000 --> 2:55:23.840]  the precedent so how does that what's the process there i guess that's appealed to a higher court
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:30.560]  because as you said these are cut and drive basic 101 rules uh of the game and they're able to do
[2:55:30.560 --> 2:55:35.120]  this is just incredible that's question a question b pete and also oh and why do you think they're so
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:39.360]  reckless why are they so wild i why are they doctoring evidence in front of everybody why are
[2:55:39.360 --> 2:55:44.320]  they doing this when they fundamentally know it's against the law well i'll go first i'll make it
[2:55:44.320 --> 2:55:51.680]  quick pete they're psychotic alex they're psychotic and i i don't think there's anybody that that has
[2:55:51.680 --> 2:55:57.120]  committed to understand the psychology of liberals right now in media i pick a lot of it up from the
[2:55:57.120 --> 2:56:02.240]  great rush limbaugh and and michael savage who's who's kind of passed his prime as well no disrespect
[2:56:02.240 --> 2:56:08.560]  they're psychotic they have a mental disorder and everything the liberal agenda trumps everything
[2:56:08.560 --> 2:56:14.480]  else in their mind you have to understand this in everything they do the liberal propaganda the
[2:56:14.480 --> 2:56:18.880]  liberal agenda trumps everything else so when you see them acting like this understand they're
[2:56:18.880 --> 2:56:22.320]  number one number two number three number four number five number six number seven number
[2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:26.880]  eight number nine number all their top 100 priorities are all whatever the liberal agenda is
[2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:34.000]  so they're acting like psychos because of it pete yeah and that's why i said uh psychotic zeal
[2:56:34.640 --> 2:56:39.280]  liz halibut and chinia there's a couple of elements here uh they have a window of opportunity
[2:56:39.280 --> 2:56:44.480]  the doj will not prosecute if you get too close to the november elections so they were pressed for
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:50.640]  time uh there was this mad rush uh to bring this soviet show trial but they're so zealous about
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:55.360]  going after president trump that they even even if they wanted to prosecute uh president trump here's
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:57:02.000]  the case the united states of america versus ollie north as the appellant the circumstances are almost
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:09.520]  identical because of his testimony to a congressional hearing he tainted the jury uh it's essentially
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:15.040]  mr supreme court but pete didn't that sound like oh the supreme court that was uh that was an appeals
[2:57:15.040 --> 2:57:21.600]  court in the district of colombia so no judge is going to override you know well settled law
[2:57:21.600 --> 2:57:26.880]  already ruled upon uh by by an appeals court their career would be destroyed at that point no
[2:57:26.880 --> 2:57:30.800]  matter how corrupt they are well that's right from day one we pointed out that they had these
[2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:34.720]  show trials it would do the same thing that happened in the in the oliver north case so the
[2:57:34.720 --> 2:57:38.400]  question is why would they do this because they only care about the optics and demonizing their
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:42.640]  political opposition as terrorists i think you both agree everybody agrees that people walk
[2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:48.080]  down the street and say man these hearings blew up in their face there's an old better one saying
[2:57:48.080 --> 2:57:55.040]  that's thousands of years old and it goes like this trust in god but tie up your camel hunter

[3:00:20.720 --> 3:00:26.160]  confinement they have absolutely railroad them and if they can do this they can railroad america

[3:00:57.520 --> 3:01:01.520]  to distract from the devaluation of the currency the inflation the tyranny the collapsing borders
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:06.080]  the human smuggling just all the crimes they're committing and so that's why this is so incredibly
[3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:09.680]  important i'm really glad that pete centeli who's a former political prisoner himself
[3:01:09.680 --> 3:01:14.240]  that they had to release it was proven that they were framing him has been so you know on the ball
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:17.920]  fighting this and as well as the rest of crews want to thank the listeners for their support
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:22.480]  and their prayers because info wars is right in the crosshairs oh and has been falsely charged
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:27.440]  obviously with all of all this crazy stuff and it just shows you how serious and how real this is
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:31.600]  sam muntoya our great employee that just shot footage like any other journalist they're trying
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:35.680]  to put him in prison and so this is a very very important time understand we need your prayers
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:40.240]  we need your support here at info wars because we're under attack at every level because we're
[3:01:40.240 --> 3:01:44.800]  the people fighting for you we're the people fighting for our own future together and we just
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:49.280]  need your support at infowarstore.com more than ever because it takes money to fight george
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:52.720]  sorrows the democratic party but we're winning hearts and minds we're winning spiritually
[3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:56.400]  we're winning culturally and the enemy knows it's so throwing everything they've got at us so
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:02:00.240]  i'm in a hand of a ton back over to pete centeli you know and shroyer then again paul joseph watson
[3:02:00.240 --> 3:02:04.720]  is coming up i run to so many great people i've been traveling on business and i just want to
[3:02:04.720 --> 3:02:08.240]  salute everybody that's waking up and tell them to wake up others and just keep spreading the word
[3:02:08.240 --> 3:02:12.400]  the chain reaction is happening victory is happening but we've got to defend our political
[3:02:12.400 --> 3:02:16.960]  prisoners ladies and gentlemen or we will all suffer their same fate god bless i hand the
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:22.000]  baton over to oh and shroyer and peace until it that's right alex thank you uh pete we've got
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:27.280]  just over two minutes left here why don't you give us some final departing words you know uh
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:32.400]  oh i'll mention you you don't even need to respond back to it with this what i'll say uh not only
[3:02:32.400 --> 3:02:38.880]  if they have they falsely charged you but they selectively charged you and targeted you because
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:44.800]  there were other journalists that went into the capital and done things even far worse than anything
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:51.760]  you uh you you were um you were found to have done uh so selective and malicious prosecution
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:57.360]  i'm also going to say this that because of this appeal and what's about to be filed here
[3:02:57.360 --> 3:03:02.800]  imminently by the attorneys in mass there's all of the january six defendants are going to pile
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:08.480]  on to this thing and and join in it's already been ruled by an appellate court almost identical
[3:03:08.480 --> 3:03:14.080]  in the ollie north case that not only have they made egregious errors oh and i'm going to throw
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  back to you to also give you final word here in commentary i believe that it was a fatal error by
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:28.480]  liz haliburton cheney she has totally and completely and i think that's the reason
[3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:34.320]  it wasn't a tactical uh reason that they call the the next hearing off i think they were advised
[3:03:34.320 --> 3:03:40.160]  by counsel you just destroyed all possibilities of prosecuting any one of these january six
[3:03:40.160 --> 3:03:45.520]  defendants i'd say that there's a 99.99 percent chance they're gonna walk all of them well and
[3:03:45.520 --> 3:03:49.760]  let me kind of just ask you the question that you've kind of already answered but maybe just
[3:03:49.760 --> 3:03:56.400]  give it a new framing um you know liz cheney jumped the shark here uh maybe bit off more than she
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:02.160]  could chew or is this kind of a probing thing of the deep state to see what they can get away with
[3:04:03.760 --> 3:04:10.880]  i would say uh no i i would say that i i felt a sense of ultra urgency for political reasons
[3:04:10.880 --> 3:04:16.240]  because the doj once you get close enough to the november elections they won't prosecute anything
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:21.760]  so any criminal referrals or anything that they're doing so they had a short window of opportunity
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:26.800]  uh i heard that they hired 600 attorneys a couple of months ago because they wanted to do
[3:04:26.800 --> 3:04:32.640]  the remaining filings uh by the end of may uh well they're they've far surpassed that now
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:37.920]  they're into the hearings uh once you get close to the november election the doj will not prosecute
[3:04:37.920 --> 3:04:44.480]  because it's political uh so she was rushed uh to to judgment here and she wanted to put herself
[3:04:44.480 --> 3:04:50.240]  to be judge jerry and executioner of course pete sand tilly thank you so much the pete sand tilly
[3:04:50.240 --> 3:04:59.280]  show paul joseph watson takes over the alex jones show now ladies and gentlemen high quality
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:05.040]  storeable food is back in stock ready to ship right now we've not been selling food for three
[3:05:05.040 --> 3:05:09.840]  months because it was taking several weeks for the food to get packaged delivered to you most of
[3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:15.120]  their companies are completely out but now they have a large spectrum of high quality food
[3:05:15.120 --> 3:05:20.480]  ready to ship everything you find that prepare with alex dot com or prepare today dot com is in
[3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:25.760]  stock ready to ship so go to prepare with alex dot com or prepare today dot com and order your

[3:05:29.840 --> 3:05:34.320]  happening with the food shortages with the wars with the collapsing wars everything's happening
[3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:38.080]  is one of the most important things you can make is to have high quality storeable food
[3:05:38.080 --> 3:05:42.240]  water filtration air filtration and more and it's not just those items it's hundreds of other
[3:05:42.240 --> 3:05:46.960]  high quality preparing this items and survival items right now and prepare with alex dot com
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:52.560]  that again redirects to prepare today dot com i would not procrastinate ladies and gentlemen
[3:05:52.560 --> 3:05:56.160]  one of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation
[3:05:56.160 --> 3:06:08.640]  is just beginning
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:22.720]  transmuting worldwide from the summit dot news studios in the united kingdom you are listening
[3:06:22.720 --> 3:06:34.880]  to her joseph that's it it is the 16th of june it is 2022 and we are live we've got a ton of news
[3:06:34.880 --> 3:06:42.560]  to cover over the course of the next hour including and once again we ask the question is diversity a
[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:49.360]  strength especially as it applies to europe given the acceleration of migration that is taking place
[3:06:49.360 --> 3:06:55.040]  from the middle east from north africa to european countries and what impact that is having at least
[3:06:55.040 --> 3:07:01.600]  in the short term not even to mention the long term on culture on society now i mentioned that
[3:07:01.600 --> 3:07:07.520]  because obviously later we're going to get into what is happening here in the uk with hundreds upon
[3:07:07.520 --> 3:07:13.280]  hundreds of boat migrants arriving from the war torn country of france apparently france is no
[3:07:13.280 --> 3:07:18.720]  longer a safe country now they have to come here because the government rewards them with
[3:07:18.720 --> 3:07:25.280]  well for a start a free taxi service when they get near the shore and free hotel accommodation as
[3:07:25.280 --> 3:07:32.960]  well as free cash free food all generous little benefits that these economic migrants the vast
[3:07:32.960 --> 3:07:40.560]  majority of them young fighting age men do not get in the quote war torn country of france
[3:07:40.560 --> 3:07:46.640]  what impact is that having on european countries well i come on this show basically every week
[3:07:46.640 --> 3:07:53.600]  and say there's a massive buried ignored story that should be global news right now which is only news
[3:07:53.600 --> 3:08:00.320]  in its host country and this week is italy because we had of course the cologne mass
[3:08:00.320 --> 3:08:07.200]  molestation back on new years eve 2015 which did make the news where huge gangs of north african
[3:08:07.200 --> 3:08:14.240]  migrants primarily from algeria conducted attacks sexual assaults molestations and physical
[3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:20.640]  full-on rapes of german women outside the cologne train station during the new years eve celebrations
[3:08:20.640 --> 3:08:27.440]  in 2015 now of course very few people got prosecuted for that but it did start a national conversation
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:36.960]  over the sanctity over the benefits of importing a million migrants which of course germany did
[3:08:36.960 --> 3:08:43.120]  from 2015 onwards merkel claimed it was a huge success what's happened in germany since tends to
[3:08:43.120 --> 3:08:50.000]  argue in the opposite direction but again a huge ignored story this time out of italy and remix news
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:57.680]  has done a full breakdown of this rmx.news italian parliament opens investigation after hundreds of
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:04.560]  migrants blamed for unleashing hell at lakeside towns with rioting and sexual assaults this
[3:09:04.560 --> 3:09:11.840]  should be one of the top stories in the world it happened about a week ago it's barely made a ripple
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:18.000]  now it's interesting that this happened around lake garter and in the villages and towns in
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:23.920]  between the circle lake garter given that of course that's where george cluney the actor
[3:09:23.920 --> 3:09:32.640]  owns one of his many multi-million dollar mansions now of course back in language 2015 2016 cluney
[3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:40.400]  said that he would be open to inviting a refugee to stay in his own home and to be fair to him
[3:09:40.400 --> 3:09:46.000]  unlike others people like jk rowling he actually did that he followed through on it of course
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:53.200]  the migrant refugee that he invited turned out to be a well-educated doctor we're not being
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:09:58.240]  a deluge with doctors and lawyers let's just say that based on the raw statistics alone
[3:09:58.240 --> 3:10:05.440]  but again that signaled cluney's virtue that he wanted these migrants these refugees to be
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:13.200]  brought into europe and now they've run riot near lake garter around the very same area that he
[3:10:13.200 --> 3:10:20.800]  owns one of his multiple mansions last week saw widespread chaos breaking out in parties in
[3:10:20.800 --> 3:10:29.120]  italian lakeside towns near lake garter involving up to two thousand migrants deluged these small
[3:10:29.120 --> 3:10:34.480]  towns and villages the italian public prosecutor's office and the italian parliament have opened a
[3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:39.760]  number of investigations which will probably go nowhere because they always do including one
[3:10:39.760 --> 3:10:47.360]  case where 30 migrant men allegedly sexually assaulted 16 girls on a train from lake garter
[3:10:47.360 --> 3:10:54.080]  to milan these migrant youths poured into these villages this was obviously predetermined
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:11:01.840]  pre-arranged attack they smashed shop windows they assaulted people on the street they stole
[3:11:01.840 --> 3:11:09.120]  people's belongings and they sexually harassed young girls in some cases children and what did
[3:11:09.120 --> 3:11:14.480]  they say while they were doing this well in the act of carrying out this absolute carnage
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:22.400]  they were waving the flags of african countries and they were openly saying we're here to invade
[3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:27.760]  no white people are allowed here in fact i'm going to get on to the exact quotes in a second
[3:11:27.760 --> 3:11:34.320]  but again this was under the guise of a street party the majority of these migrants the vast
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:38.640]  majority were north african it's the same demographic that we see over and over again
[3:11:38.640 --> 3:11:42.080]  some were sub-saharan african from the videos that i've seen
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:48.800]  they destroyed everything said a business owner speaking with corriera de la cera one of
[3:11:48.800 --> 3:11:53.920]  its least biggest newspapers they broke shop windows stormed the tourist train and blocked
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:12:03.120]  passes by on four or by malped riot police arrived imagine this a peaceful tourist lakeside village
[3:12:03.680 --> 3:12:10.000]  and riot police have to show up to deal with this is that a strength is that really something
[3:12:10.000 --> 3:12:17.200]  that we should be encouraging in our european villages in holiday tourist resorts when riot
[3:12:17.200 --> 3:12:21.920]  police attempted to intervene the group of teens began throwing stones i don't know if they were
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:28.400]  first or second generation immigrants said or a to galley the mayor of peshira they're just a race
[3:12:28.400 --> 3:12:36.400]  of criminals who have left a deep wound in my community we lived a day of war it was absolute
[3:12:36.400 --> 3:12:43.600]  bedlam and again no global mainstream media coverage whatsoever one video shows the group
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:49.040]  attacking a motorcyclist causing a traffic jam another video shows them trying to tear away
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:55.840]  another passenger's purse another twitter user who posted a video of the incident wrote quote
[3:12:55.840 --> 3:13:01.760]  thousands of immigrants unleash hell in peshira delgada vandalism fights clashes with police
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:08.000]  stabbings families robbed tourist terrified and forced to flee the process of integrating
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:16.080]  migrants in italy has clearly bailed remember a couple of weeks ago we had the swedish prime
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:22.800]  minister left wing swedish feminist prime minister come out and admit that their attempts to integrate
[3:13:22.800 --> 3:13:29.520]  to absorb such huge numbers of migrants in that scandinavian country have again completely failed
[3:13:29.520 --> 3:13:36.080]  we had the top left wing belgian political leader come out a few weeks before that and say he was
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:42.080]  driving through mollambique which is a suburb of brussels in belgium and he felt that it no longer
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:49.040]  resembled belgium at all these no-go zones these ghettos are getting worse and worse and worse
[3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:55.920]  because more of the same demographic is pouring in the sexual assaults continue to happen the mass
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:14:01.280]  robbings continue to happen as we saw before the champions league final in paris last month
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:10.480]  the only difference is back in 2015 1617 these were major stories these were the centerpiece
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:16.480]  of massive conversations about whether indeed diversity is a strength whether this rate of
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:23.840]  accelerated migration is happening too quickly now you don't even hear about it the champions
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:29.680]  league final thing was one of the biggest stories of the year i follow this i didn't even know it
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:36.960]  had happened until almost a week afterwards same thing with this series of incidents in italy
[3:14:36.960 --> 3:14:43.840]  days later i find out about it through what to the average normie would be relatively obscure
[3:14:43.840 --> 3:14:50.080]  websites which track this kind of thing and which get translated reports out of countries like italy
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:57.040]  so again it's under investigation just like the champions league riot chaos is under investigation
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:01.920]  which again the process is the cover-up the investigation is the cover-up and we're going
[3:15:01.920 --> 3:15:08.720]  to get into that in the next segment but again sexually assaulted girls it's the same demographic
[3:15:08.720 --> 3:15:15.120]  that mass molested women in cologne germany back in 2015 italy is dealing with this there
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:21.120]  they recently released a criminal statistics which found that migrants despite again making up a
[3:15:21.120 --> 3:15:27.680]  small portion of their population account for nearly half of rapes in italy and we continue
[3:15:27.680 --> 3:15:34.160]  to import this same culture in different european countries with devastating impacts not just in
[3:15:34.160 --> 3:15:39.200]  terms of crime and sexual assaults but as with the manchester arena bombing carried out by a
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:46.160]  refugee rescued by our own government deathly terrorist jihadist attacks we're going to come
[3:15:46.160 --> 3:15:50.640]  back yet more into this get into what's happening with the boat migrant crisis in england this is

[3:19:55.200 --> 3:20:14.480]  action leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:15.040 --> 3:20:20.080]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:20:20.080 --> 3:20:30.880]  so two thousand migrant men from north african countries or at least african north african
[3:20:30.880 --> 3:20:37.280]  migrant background invaded this small village in a series of villages and towns around lake
[3:20:37.280 --> 3:20:44.400]  garter in italy a tourist area these incidents were pre arranged and they were convened as remix
[3:20:44.400 --> 3:20:52.000]  news reports under the slogan african empeciera they were waving moroccan flags the country the
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:57.760]  flags of other african countries breitbart reports on the comments of some of these
[3:20:57.760 --> 3:21:03.280]  individuals which again were mostly young men aged between 16 and 20 attacking people sexually
[3:21:03.280 --> 3:21:09.920]  assaulting women throwing objects at police smashing into shop windows stealing people's
[3:21:09.920 --> 3:21:15.920]  belongings and what did they say while they were carrying out this carnage quote we came here to
[3:21:15.920 --> 3:21:25.520]  reconquer pesciera this is our territory africa must come here now at least for an hour or two of
[3:21:25.520 --> 3:21:32.640]  absolute bedlam africa did come to pesciera around lake garter in italy and i think we can
[3:21:32.640 --> 3:21:38.320]  conclude from what happened that africa coming to europe is certainly not a good development
[3:21:38.320 --> 3:21:45.520]  and it certainly goes some way to disprove the mantra that diversity is a strength now why this
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:52.160]  is even more concerning because a survey came out a few days ago headline survey more than half of
[3:21:52.160 --> 3:21:58.640]  young people want to leave africa oh great and when do they want to come they want to come to europe
[3:21:59.280 --> 3:22:03.520]  a new survey of 15 african countries has found that more than half of young people want to
[3:22:03.520 --> 3:22:07.920]  leave the continent in the coming years with the majority of those who emigrate expected to head
[3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:15.360]  to europe and again you have to put in the proviso hashtag not all africans if i came from some s
[3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:21.840]  whole country in africa i'd be the same as them i'd want to go to europe and yes obviously the vast
[3:22:21.840 --> 3:22:27.440]  majority of them are not no rape women they're not going to commit crimes but a significant enough
[3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:34.080]  portion of them do and if you invite millions and millions of africans into europe europe is
[3:22:34.080 --> 3:22:40.800]  going to become more like africa which is not a good thing because why are they leaving africa
[3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:48.720]  in the first place now we had this story and i'm going to get to the video about the champions
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:54.960]  league final because again more updates on that cover up in full swing but again this is another
[3:22:54.960 --> 3:23:00.800]  story that got zero attention it was in swedish media for a day then it was forgotten father of
[3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:07.920]  swedish child islamic terror victim says her stock home grave has been desecrated over 100
[3:23:07.920 --> 3:23:16.480]  times this is the father of eba akaland the 11 year old swedish girl who was torn limb from limb
[3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:22.320]  on the streets of stock home by an islamic terrorist an illegal migrant oh and by the way
[3:23:22.320 --> 3:23:30.480]  a refugee a rejected asylum seeker from us bekistan back in 2017 the attack killed five people
[3:23:30.480 --> 3:23:34.800]  it seriously injured 14 others it's probably a miracle that it didn't kill more than that
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:41.520]  obviously that event on a standalone basis is horrific enough of course in the broader context
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:47.360]  of what happened over the course of those years it's kind of tailed off a little bit thankfully
[3:23:47.360 --> 3:23:53.440]  because trump kicked isis's ass and these attacks stopped happening to some extent they're still
[3:23:53.440 --> 3:23:58.720]  attempting them we've been lucky over the past couple of years several of them have been stopped
[3:23:58.720 --> 3:24:03.200]  unlike the manchester bombing which wasn't stopped because the police and security guards feared
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:09.120]  being called racist even though they saw a young muslim fiddling with a huge backpack right before
[3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:16.480]  he blew himself up and killed 23 people a lot of them children but again i guess not being called
[3:24:16.480 --> 3:24:22.240]  racist is kind of more important than saving the lives of children from being blown up and dismembered
[3:24:22.240 --> 3:24:29.920]  limb from limb isn't it so this 11 year old swedish girl killed by a terrorist that's not enough
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:36.480]  apparently she's buried in stock home which again is absorbing huge numbers of these islamic migrants
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:45.360]  and her grave in stock home has been desecrated a hundred times at least and they won't even
[3:24:45.360 --> 3:24:52.960]  install cctv to try and catch the perpetrators they caught one of them back in 2018 and guess what
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:59.760]  he turned out to be an illegal migrant a refugee imagine my shock so it's not enough to kill an
[3:24:59.760 --> 3:25:05.920]  11 year old girl by ramming a truck into her tearing her limb from limb and if you've seen the pictures
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:13.120]  will know the scale of this horror no they have to literally desecrate her grave in stock home
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:19.440]  home for what message to send i don't know i mean the mind boggles at this point but again he's out
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:28.240]  in the media desperately complaining this bereaved father who visits his lost daughter's grave every
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:34.800]  day at 10 a.m to say good morning every evening at 6 p.m to say good night he's going back there
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:41.120]  the little trinkets he's left the flowers in honor of his slain daughter have been stolen
[3:25:41.120 --> 3:25:49.440]  have been ripped up have been smashed desecrated this is happening in a european capital city
[3:25:49.440 --> 3:25:55.600]  and again it was in the news for a day in sweden nobody knows about it and all those protesters
[3:25:55.600 --> 3:26:01.680]  are out on the streets once again they're down in dover with their little placards refugees
[3:26:01.680 --> 3:26:07.600]  welcome not even considering for a second the absolute carnage and horror that this policy
[3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:14.480]  has visited on europe Putin plans to weaponize refugees to generate instability in europe but
[3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:20.800]  wait after thought refugees welcome diversity of strength why would he be weaponizing refugees
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:28.880]  to cause instability in europe unless mass waves of unintegrated migrants cause instability
[3:26:28.880 --> 3:26:34.560]  in the host countries that they can't do and again this we had a story last week
[3:26:34.560 --> 3:26:40.560]  a president erdo and out of turkey has been doing exactly the same thing he threatens
[3:26:40.560 --> 3:26:45.680]  Greece over and over again if you try and block this sale of fighter jets from america to turkey
[3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:53.440]  i will unleash another wave of refugees to culturally enrich your country if it's such
[3:26:53.440 --> 3:26:58.400]  a good thing and if there are no overwhelmingly negative consequences of absorbing all these
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:04.800]  refugees why are world leaders threatening to use them as weapons against countries they don't like
[3:27:05.680 --> 3:27:06.960]  interesting that isn't it
[3:27:09.200 --> 3:27:15.440]  switzerland illegal immigrant attacks massive church organ recently restored for 530 000 euros
[3:27:15.440 --> 3:27:22.560]  in a swiss city syrian migrant blames rape of eight-year-old stepdaughter on alcohol claims
[3:27:22.560 --> 3:27:31.120]  she's older than that in her head nice and then off the backdrop of all this we have a
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:35.440]  border policy situation in the united kingdom which i'm going to get into in the next segment
[3:27:35.440 --> 3:27:41.280]  where the government said don't worry we've got a solution as we literally roll out the red carpet
[3:27:41.280 --> 3:27:47.040]  and invite all these migrants in from the war-torn country of france which apparently is too intolerable
[3:27:47.040 --> 3:27:53.920]  for them to stay there rescue them in royal navy boats rescue them in charity boats put them up in
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:59.440]  30 000 hotel rooms at a cost of five million pounds a day to the taxpayer
[3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:06.880]  hundreds and hundreds coming in every day 50 000 have come in so far since 2018 maybe 100 000 more
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:13.600]  are going to come in this year their solution to that is to send them to ruanda these left-wing
[3:28:13.600 --> 3:28:19.520]  groups the european court of human rights and activist judges in the united kingdom say no
[3:28:19.520 --> 3:28:24.800]  you're not doing that this is the same government that locked us down overnight with no legal hurdles
[3:28:24.800 --> 3:28:31.520]  but apparently they can't deport a single illegal immigrant without the entire force of a policy
[3:28:31.520 --> 3:28:36.480]  collapsing and i've got a couple of videos on that which i'm going to get into in the next segment
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:41.600]  and then we're going to contrast it with what is happening as these illegals event are given royal
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:48.160]  treatment to british citizens who post offensive memes in private chat groups you're not going to
[3:28:48.160 --> 3:28:57.840]  believe this we'll be back summit dot news don't go away the globalists are making their move

[3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:23.280]  system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this so it's a
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:28.960]  very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able

[3:32:06.000 --> 3:32:11.760]  i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked about is going to
[3:32:11.760 --> 3:32:18.240]  become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports
[3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:24.240]  and documents it's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[3:32:24.880 --> 3:32:30.960]  the billderberg group founded davos group so now the fight's out in the open they're making

[3:32:52.960 --> 3:33:00.400]  done and ask you now to redouble your efforts leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[3:33:00.400 --> 3:33:16.320]  world order it's alex jones
[3:33:16.320 --> 3:33:24.240]  uh
[3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:33.280]  broadcasting internationally from the summit dot news headquarters in the united kingdom it's paul
[3:33:33.280 --> 3:33:40.800]  joseph watson i've been rambling on for two segments now and if i don't get to these videos
[3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:45.680]  i'll never get to them we'll come back and we'll talk about the ramifications of this but first
[3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:53.440]  let's go to this video which focuses on the uk angle the absolute shambles of uk borders
[3:33:53.440 --> 3:33:59.440]  this video is called an absolute farce let's roll it here it is the british government's
[3:33:59.440 --> 3:34:05.520]  naff attempt to deal with uncontrolled immigration has been an absolute shambles you mean the same
[3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:10.800]  government that literally provides a taxi service for illegal boat migrants incentivizing them to
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:16.160]  come here from france and rewarding criminal people smugglers before putting them up in hotels at
[3:34:16.160 --> 3:34:20.960]  taxpayer expense is completely useless when it comes to trying to deport them wow who could
[3:34:20.960 --> 3:34:26.880]  have foreseen that thanks to mobs of protesters and activist judges the first flight of illegal
[3:34:26.880 --> 3:34:32.720]  migrants being deported to ruanda was whittled down to just a handful then thanks to an intervention
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:39.360]  by the european court of human rights the plane didn't take off at all the european court of human
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:45.360]  rights i thought we'd voted to leave the european union doesn't matter we're still taking orders
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:51.520]  from them it's an absolute farce this is the same Tory government that locked down the entire
[3:34:51.520 --> 3:34:57.680]  population of the country overnight with no legal hurdles whatsoever yet when it comes to
[3:34:57.680 --> 3:35:03.440]  deporting a single migrant they're rendered completely impotent where were all those activist
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:09.200]  judges in march 2020 when brits were placed under de facto house arrest they're more interested in
[3:35:09.200 --> 3:35:14.640]  protecting the rights of illegal migrants who broke the law to get here than the rights of
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:20.320]  actual british citizens case in point while economic migrants fleeing the war-torn country of
[3:35:21.040 --> 3:35:26.000]  france are treated like royalty because of activist judges british citizens are being
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:32.480]  thrown in prison for sharing edgy memes no this is not a babel on b story a man was actually
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:40.080]  given 20 weeks in prison by a judge for posting offensive george floyd memes in private chat
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:47.200]  groups absolute unmitigated weapons grade clam world pretty patelle says critics have no alternative
[3:35:47.200 --> 3:35:53.280]  proposals to deal with uncontrolled immigration is a proposal stop rolling out the red carpet for
[3:35:53.280 --> 3:35:58.960]  them in the first place italy's mattio salvini halved the number of migrant deaths at sea
[3:35:58.960 --> 3:36:05.600]  by vowing to turn the boats back it saves migrant lives and it saves the lives of westerners lest
[3:36:05.600 --> 3:36:12.640]  we forget the manchester arena bomber was literally rescued as a refugee by our royal navy and
[3:36:12.640 --> 3:36:18.480]  despite numerous police officers and security guards witnessing his overtly suspicious behavior
[3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:25.120]  they refused to stop him for fear of being called racist shortly after he blew himself up killing
[3:36:25.120 --> 3:36:31.520]  23 and injuring over a thousand people many of them children now our pathetic government is being
[3:36:31.520 --> 3:36:38.400]  bullied into submission by far-left protesters the eu and activist judges for fear of being called
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:45.760]  racist having handed ruanda 120 million quid upfront as part of this genius plan nearly a
[3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:50.880]  thousand boat migrants have arrived in britain since sunday alone while they fail to deport a
[3:36:50.880 --> 3:36:56.640]  single migrant to ruanda again almost all of them young men economic migrants coming from france
[3:36:56.640 --> 3:37:01.680]  a safe country to the benefits haven of great britain now the migrants who are supposed to be
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:07.760]  deported to ruanda have been set loose in the community by the end of the year if nothing changes
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:13.440]  a hundred thousand boat migrants are expected to enter britain while they continue to be looked
[3:37:13.440 --> 3:37:19.440]  after in hotels or huge numbers of them dumped on tiny villages like linton on ooze just grow
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:23.920]  a frigging spine and enforce the law how hard can it be
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:32.960]  now i mentioned it in that video and i mean i'm not surprised by much these days but sometimes
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:40.720]  you see these stories and it is a face palm moment yes a man was arrested in the uk
[3:37:40.720 --> 3:37:48.800]  former police officer and convicted for posting offensive george floyd memes in private what's
[3:37:48.800 --> 3:37:54.640]  happened facebook group chats back in 2020 he committed this horrendous thought crime
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:01.760]  he's literally going to prison for posting edgy memes in a private group chat again this is in a
[3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:09.760]  country where the police came out the national police chief counsel back in 2015 and said their
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:15.520]  resources are too stretched there isn't enough time to deal with the crimes and they can't
[3:38:15.520 --> 3:38:22.320]  attend burglaries in 2018 it was revealed that two-thirds of burglaries in the united kingdom
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:29.280]  aren't even investigated but they have the resources to investigate to prosecute to convict
[3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:36.240]  to imprison a 31 year old man for posting funny memes on a facebook private chat group
[3:38:36.240 --> 3:38:45.920]  absolutely incredible and then you look further into the details this guy by the way could have
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:51.760]  probably won this if he hadn't cowed and submitted at the start by apologizing and saying he was sorry
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:56.720]  if he'd have actually got a decent lawyer he would have won but he didn't because there's another
[3:38:56.720 --> 3:39:01.520]  case of one of his colleagues who did the same egregious behavior of posting offensive memes
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:07.840]  who is now on trial for the same thing but when the judge handed down this prison sentence he
[3:39:07.840 --> 3:39:14.240]  openly said he was making an example of this individual former police officer james was
[3:39:14.880 --> 3:39:19.840]  he said quote a message must go out and that message can only go out through an immediate
[3:39:19.840 --> 3:39:29.840]  sentence of imprisonment this guy is in prison for posting a meme that made fun of george floyd
[3:39:29.840 --> 3:39:36.320]  he didn't even post it publicly on the internet he posted it in a private chat group someone
[3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:42.240]  ratted him out to the authorities and now he's a criminal and that's on his record for life
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:53.120]  this is the kicker the guy because he was in the prison system because he was basically part of
[3:39:53.120 --> 3:40:00.560]  society which is how everyone has to go through this social engineering diversity training brain
[3:40:00.560 --> 3:40:07.360]  washing while giving him the sentence the judge on top of that lectured him that he should have
[3:40:07.360 --> 3:40:17.040]  known better because he received quote training in relation to diversity and inclusion absolutely
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:24.160]  incredible the judge by the way was a migrant that's quite funny isn't it in 2017 it was reported
[3:40:24.160 --> 3:40:32.320]  that british police had arrested 3395 people for offensive online comments in the space of a single
[3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:38.080]  year but they can't attend burglaries if you get robbed you're screwed they don't have the resources
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:47.360]  post a spicy meme about george floyd get in prison absolute weapons grade clown world meanwhile
[3:40:47.360 --> 3:40:52.000]  migrants landing in britain will refuse to board rwanda flights and one policy won't stop them
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:58.240]  crossing the channel as 677 arriving two days and two boats are brought ashore at dover today
[3:40:58.240 --> 3:41:04.880]  if you get on a boat and break the law by entering the country and then i just set loose in the
[3:41:04.880 --> 3:41:09.680]  community to get up to whatever you want and as we saw in italy as we saw before the champions
[3:41:09.680 --> 3:41:16.320]  league final a couple of weeks ago they really do enriches culturally you get treated like literal
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:22.480]  royalty you get free hotel rooms you get free cash you get free food you get free wi-fi which
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:26.320]  then the migrants complain about because their iPhones don't work properly because they're so
[3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:34.160]  oppressed that's all good and dandy but if as a british citizen you post a spicy meme on facebook
[3:41:34.160 --> 3:41:42.640]  private chat group not only will you be investigated they seized his phone convicted sent to prison
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:48.080]  for 20 weeks while you're being sent down the judge will lecture you about how you should have
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:54.000]  known better because you went through the social engineering diversity training brainwashing
[3:41:54.720 --> 3:42:00.720]  absolutely incredible i'm going to come back in the next segment i think we'll play the
[3:42:00.720 --> 3:42:06.000]  champions league video because then again there's an update on that case and it ties into everything
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:12.560]  that i've been saying also get a little bit into coveted and then he found she has had four count
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:20.160]  them for coveted 19 vaccinations and he just has tested positive for coveted once again this is the
[3:42:20.160 --> 3:42:26.480]  same guy who says he won't go to white house events because he doesn't want to risk spreading the
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:32.000]  disease or catching the disease but then the night before the white house press events he'll go to a
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:37.760]  private party and getting close proximity with don lemon and all the other people attending
[3:42:37.760 --> 3:42:44.080]  without wearing a face mask and that's all good and well we'll get into the latest on monkeypox
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:50.880]  and if we've got time we'll dig into the latest benefits that the much wanted lgbt community
[3:42:50.880 --> 3:42:57.520]  is offering up summit dot news we'll be back on going there's an old better one saying that's
[3:42:57.520 --> 3:43:04.320]  thousands of years old and it goes like this trust in god but tie up your camel hunter as

[3:44:08.560 --> 3:44:15.120]  is there a real study of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design the large central banks
[3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:21.280]  that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics that look into say the
[3:44:21.280 --> 3:44:25.360]  anglo-american establishment the sound of the builder bird group the trilateral commission
[3:44:25.360 --> 3:44:30.880]  the united nations the whole project of the rock shawls and the rock folks until 10 years ago the
[3:44:30.880 --> 3:44:36.480]  media said the control corporate media the builder bird group didn't exist well now the builder bird

[3:44:47.760 --> 3:44:52.640]  globalist head on about the second thing or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover
[3:44:52.640 --> 3:44:58.480]  we don't have a shot we do expose them we can beat them easily the internet and talk radio are on fire
[3:44:58.480 --> 3:45:03.360]  with the slogan alec shawls was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually
[3:45:03.360 --> 3:45:09.840]  very sick feeling because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it and now everything i've talked

[3:47:17.120 --> 3:47:26.400]  now we are going to try and get through at least two of these videos because i've only played one
[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:30.400]  because i've been renting for the entire show let's round up on the whole migrant situation
[3:47:30.400 --> 3:47:35.440]  with this video of course i talked about the top of the show the mass molestation of women
[3:47:35.440 --> 3:47:40.560]  the crimes that took place around late garter in italy we also had similar scenes before the
[3:47:40.560 --> 3:47:46.080]  champions league final in paris a couple of weeks ago but now during the course of the
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:50.080]  investigation we learned that the footage which would have shown who was responsible
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:55.440]  has been mysteriously deleted it's gone here's the video let's roll it
[3:47:57.440 --> 3:48:02.800]  so rwanda when that announcement was made i told you there'd be a problem i predicted
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:07.920]  that the european court of human rights would get involved of course no one listened they never do
[3:48:07.920 --> 3:48:12.960]  and we were given assurances by pretty paternal barris johnson but all would be well this policy
[3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:17.760]  would happen maybe even launched a facebook campaign saying the people don't come to britain
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:25.280]  or you might end up in rwanda well here we are in brexit britain we voted not to have european courts
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:32.080]  making decisions over our lives and yet on that runway yesterday at boscombe down the last few
[3:48:32.080 --> 3:48:37.680]  people who were due to go to rwanda the previous lot all having been taken off because of the human
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:43.840]  rights act and we had an intervention from the strazberg court which means that no one left
[3:48:43.840 --> 3:48:52.240]  for rwanda yesterday or by the way 444 came in through dover yesterday as i speak this morning
[3:48:52.240 --> 3:48:56.960]  there are loads more crossing the channel there are going to be over the course of the next few
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:03.120]  months tens of thousands of young men that come across the english channel according to the today
[3:49:03.120 --> 3:49:09.440]  program this morning they're all desperate people well some may be the vast majority are coming here
[3:49:09.440 --> 3:49:15.120]  for purely economic reasons and many of course will finish up in this country in a form of modern
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:22.800]  day slavery and a form of criminality so what happens now well as ever borris will bluster well
[3:49:22.800 --> 3:49:29.280]  we'll have to look at possibly changing legislation and in two weeks time dominant rob you know the
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:33.440]  one the guy that looks like a rabbit in the headlights god knows how people like this are
[3:49:33.440 --> 3:49:39.040]  running our country he will introduce a british bill of rights that will be told it will amend
[3:49:39.920 --> 3:49:46.320]  the chr it will amend the human rights act it will make no difference and our newspapers the
[3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:54.160]  front pages will go on and on and on condemning lefty judges but it's just like the same argument
[3:49:54.160 --> 3:50:00.480]  about EU membership for years and years and years politicians and press moaned about decisions taken
[3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:08.480]  with the european union it was uke that said let's end this let's leave we left we thought in doing
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:14.400]  so there'd be no more foreign courts we thought in doing so we'd get back control of our borders
[3:50:14.400 --> 3:50:20.720]  and now we find because borris didn't do brexit properly because we stayed part of the echr
[3:50:20.720 --> 3:50:26.240]  our own they'll tell you it's different to the EU well believe you me in strazburg you can walk
[3:50:26.240 --> 3:50:32.320]  from the european parliament through the corridors straight into the european court they are completely
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:40.640]  interconnected i don't think this government have got the guts to grasp this nettle they fear
[3:50:40.640 --> 3:50:46.240]  being condemned but they're being condemned anyway by the archbishop of canterbury prince
[3:50:46.240 --> 3:50:52.560]  charles the media most people in parliament including many on the conservative side this
[3:50:52.560 --> 3:50:59.680]  folks is brexit 2.0 this is about are we really going to get back control of our country and our
[3:50:59.680 --> 3:51:07.440]  borders we should not be continued to be bound by 1951 convention from the un we should not have
[3:51:07.440 --> 3:51:14.800]  that european court of human rights in strazburg overriding a supreme court decision yesterday
[3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:20.560]  if we want okay that is nigel forage talking about the disastrous rwanda migrant policy
[3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:25.760]  which has fallen flat on its face and failed in the united kingdom over the past 48 hours
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:29.680]  we got the order mixed up but we're going to go to this video now because i talked about what
[3:51:29.680 --> 3:51:36.000]  happened in italy earlier on in the show similar scenes unplayed in paris before the champions
[3:51:36.000 --> 3:51:42.560]  league final a couple of weeks ago this video is called it's mysteriously disappeared the footage
[3:51:42.560 --> 3:51:46.320]  showing what happened has just vanished it's gone here's the clue
[3:51:48.160 --> 3:51:53.440]  given the authorities in paris promised to conduct a full investigation into the chaos that occurred
[3:51:53.440 --> 3:51:57.920]  before the champions league final you'd think they'd have requested all the security footage from
[3:51:57.920 --> 3:52:04.640]  around the ground showing what happened and it's gone yeah all the evidence showing who was behind
[3:52:04.640 --> 3:52:10.960]  the rioting robbing and violent attacks on livable and rail madrid supporters has been deleted
[3:52:10.960 --> 3:52:16.960]  whoops the stad de france said it wiped the footage after a week as it's standard because no
[3:52:16.960 --> 3:52:22.320]  request to obtain it was received both police and prosecutors never requested the footage
[3:52:22.320 --> 3:52:27.200]  baffling experts and law enforcement sources and the latest information only adds to the
[3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:32.080]  scandal surrounding the event reports remix news wrongly we may not have known that many people
[3:52:32.080 --> 3:52:37.200]  had experienced hell we were not aware that these videos showed very serious things no one told us
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:41.600]  about it claimed one police source the stadium features cameras at every entrance and on the
[3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:46.880]  grounds of the stadium which likely means hundreds of hours of valuable footage has been lost camera
[3:52:46.880 --> 3:52:53.520]  footage from french public transport operator ratp was also deleted after 72 hours for the same
[3:52:53.520 --> 3:52:58.400]  reason the authorities didn't ask for it to be saved in any modern investigation one of the
[3:52:58.400 --> 3:53:04.560]  first steps investigators take is to secure video footage even for minor crimes the fact that courts
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:09.280]  and police forgot to request footage featuring one of the biggest riots at one of the world's
[3:53:09.280 --> 3:53:14.160]  biggest sporting events is perplexing and lacks credibility according to sources close to the
[3:53:14.160 --> 3:53:18.960]  case there hasn't been a surveillance camera cock up this disastrous since diana and dodie
[3:53:18.960 --> 3:53:23.920]  fired entered the pond the lalma tunnel if you know you know lest we forget according to victims
[3:53:23.920 --> 3:53:29.440]  and eyewitness reports the bedlam was largely the work of migrant youths from the sand in the area
[3:53:29.440 --> 3:53:34.720]  which is home to 400 000 illegal immigrants apparently in their continued effort to pretend
[3:53:34.720 --> 3:53:40.240]  that such no-go zones don't exist the authorities conveniently forgot to secure the evidence that
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:45.280]  would have proved they're a massive and growing problem and that maybe just maybe diversity isn't
[3:53:45.280 --> 3:53:50.560]  always a strength the poll found that 76 percent of french people didn't believe the official
[3:53:50.560 --> 3:53:55.520]  explanation behind the riots which was to blame liverpool fans who were actually the victims
[3:53:55.520 --> 3:53:59.840]  yeah good luck rebuilding that trust when you've allowed all the footage to be lost
[3:54:02.240 --> 3:54:06.400]  there you have it there's a few minutes left so we'll switch gears this headline went up on
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:12.560]  summit.news about two hours ago doctor criticized over tweets showing his baby wearing face mask
[3:54:12.560 --> 3:54:19.440]  filtration device on pram yes the covid cultists despite the fact that to all intents and purposes
[3:54:19.440 --> 3:54:23.920]  the pandemic appears to be coming to an end unless they bring it back in winter which they
[3:54:23.920 --> 3:54:32.640]  probably will still zealous in their beliefs there's a pediatrician on twitter and i expect him to
[3:54:32.640 --> 3:54:37.440]  lock down his account or disappear entirely at some point which is why i save screenshots of these
[3:54:37.440 --> 3:54:44.880]  tweets this is dr greg kelly who is based in australia an icu specialist again a covid cultist
[3:54:44.880 --> 3:54:50.560]  he wants all the restrictions to return he's openly bragging on twitter about how he puts
[3:54:50.560 --> 3:54:57.440]  his baby in a face mask but the baby doesn't want to wear a face mask he's pulling it off
[3:54:57.440 --> 3:55:02.800]  he keeps sucking on the mask from the inside rendering it useless he's then posted another
[3:55:02.800 --> 3:55:10.720]  tweet as you see right there where he's got some kind of air filter airtight seal with some contraption
[3:55:10.720 --> 3:55:17.360]  attached to it over his pram his baby's pram so the baby doesn't breathe any fresh air because
[3:55:17.360 --> 3:55:24.240]  god forbid it might contain the deadly covid of course the actual number of children who have been
[3:55:24.240 --> 3:55:30.240]  killed by covid over the past two years is lower than the number of children who have been killed
[3:55:30.240 --> 3:55:38.320]  by falling over from putting their pants on but he's decided not only to mask smother his baby in
[3:55:38.320 --> 3:55:44.000]  face masks at every available opportunity but brag about it on twitter like it's a great thing
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:52.160]  small problem with that speech therapists are now reporting that there's a 350 plus
[3:55:52.160 --> 3:55:58.720]  percent increase in referrals of babies and toddlers with cognitive learning disorders
[3:55:58.720 --> 3:56:03.760]  because either they're wearing masks or more specifically adults have been wearing masks
[3:56:03.760 --> 3:56:10.800]  on and off for the past two years we also had a study out of brown university which found that
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:16.960]  mean IQ scores of young children born during the pandemic have tumbled by as much as 22 points
[3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:21.920]  we have a study out of royal college of speech and language therapists
[3:56:21.920 --> 3:56:26.800]  which found that quote repeated lockdowns had left young children without the chance to play
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:33.120]  and learn how to communicate setting back their development you have children as we highlighted
[3:56:33.120 --> 3:56:39.200]  earlier earlier in the week with another study being unable to say their own name when they
[3:56:39.200 --> 3:56:45.760]  enter elementary school they can't even talk because of social isolation caused by lockdown
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:51.680]  because of cognitive learning development disorders delays in their verbal communication
[3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:57.200]  learning and of course masks adults wearing masks of course kids learn how to speak
[3:56:57.840 --> 3:57:03.280]  via facial expressions from their parents from other people from other kids it's all
[3:57:03.280 --> 3:57:09.840]  contributed to an absolute disaster in terms of young children being held back in their education
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:17.200]  an impact that could last as we know for a lifetime we've got speech therapists reporting
[3:57:17.200 --> 3:57:24.480]  a 350 plus percent increase in children exhibiting signs of autism at a very early age because of
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:30.800]  the lockdowns because of the face masks and this quack doctor is all over twitter bragging about
[3:57:30.800 --> 3:57:38.720]  smothering his six month old baby in one of them like it's a good thing absolutely ludicrous
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:42.640]  summit dot news is done we'll be back with war room don't go away
