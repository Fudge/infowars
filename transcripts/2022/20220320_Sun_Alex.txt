[00:00.000 --> 00:23.400]  It's Sunday, March 20, 2022, you have found the embattled, bloodied, punished, but in
[00:23.400 --> 00:29.800]  ways stronger than ever, tip of the spear, promoting truth, justice, and a human future.
[00:29.800 --> 00:33.520]  I'm going to be live here this evening with an incredible four-hour broadcast, not just
[00:33.520 --> 00:39.080]  my own Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., but Sunday live, normally hosted by Owen Shroyer.
[00:39.080 --> 00:41.160]  I'll be hosting that as well.
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.800]  We have a special guest in studio coming up, I'll tell you a little bit about later.
[00:47.800 --> 00:51.400]  Every time I start the broadcast now, I tend to say, man, I've got to really be good today
[00:51.400 --> 00:54.680]  and try to cover all this because it's also incredibly important, and we're definitely
[00:54.680 --> 01:00.920]  going to be doing that today, but here's the show broadcast headline today that I really
[01:00.920 --> 01:03.840]  think tells you everything you need to know.
[01:03.840 --> 01:10.320]  When I make a statement like this, I put a lot of calculus and a lot of pieces of information
[01:10.320 --> 01:14.520]  into it that would take days to lay out, I'm going to lay out some of it, but what you
[01:14.520 --> 01:24.560]  need to know is that the Russians are warning that the deep state, the globalist deep state
[01:24.560 --> 01:32.080]  will put the show headline up, it's up, it's live, but the globalist deep state may be
[01:32.080 --> 01:39.400]  planning a massive false flag by assassinating U.S. officials, including Joe Biden.
[01:39.400 --> 01:47.200]  Now when I saw that Russian report and I noticed that Biden is going to be in Europe for the
[01:47.200 --> 01:56.840]  NATO summit this week, this week starting today, and you add everything else together,
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.960]  I have always believed, and you know this, that they're going to assassinate Biden.
[02:01.960 --> 02:06.360]  It never made sense how they were running a corpse, it never made sense how he would
[02:06.360 --> 02:11.000]  destroy them in the ratings, never made sense about what would they do before the midterms,
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.920]  but by killing him, just like John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln, he will then have the
[02:17.920 --> 02:24.600]  quote Reconstruction 2.0, or Marshall Law in America, which will also then be blamed
[02:24.600 --> 02:25.600]  on the Russians.
[02:25.600 --> 02:31.040]  So they'll have a domestic crackdown, they've already geared up with January 6th as the
[02:31.040 --> 02:39.520]  cover story, they'll have an international crackdown, going after the Russians and others,
[02:39.520 --> 02:43.520]  and really hand dictatorial power to the deep state and the Democrats, which they will never
[02:43.520 --> 02:46.000]  relinquish again.
[02:46.000 --> 02:54.400]  The perfect false flag would be the assassination of Biden.
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.760]  Now for those of you that don't know how World War I started, I'm going to get into it when
[02:59.760 --> 03:02.640]  we come back, but this is a big, big deal.
[03:02.640 --> 03:08.760]  So there's your full show headline that everybody should share, like World War III depends on
[03:08.760 --> 03:13.200]  it, like stopping World War III depends on it, because I don't just say things like this
[03:13.200 --> 03:15.840]  to be a fiction writer.
[03:15.840 --> 03:18.360]  This is a real possibility.
[03:18.360 --> 03:22.760]  Emergency Sunday broadcast, Russia warns, deep state may assassinate Biden, trigger massive
[03:22.760 --> 03:33.280]  escalation and war.
[03:33.280 --> 03:46.280]  So we're talking about a mask of escalation in the war, and that's what we're dealing
[03:46.280 --> 03:50.240]  with as a society and as a civilization.
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.120]  And I don't just believe what the Russians say.
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.920]  I know the New World Order's history, I know how British intelligence that's kind of the
[03:59.920 --> 04:05.800]  key operating system of this operates, and the minute I saw that this morning, I got
[04:05.800 --> 04:10.960]  chills up and down my spine, and that's when my spirit or subconscious, whatever you want
[04:10.960 --> 04:17.800]  to call it, is much more powerful in your conscious mind, says, look at this, because
[04:17.800 --> 04:22.120]  the Russians didn't say they think they're going to try to kill Biden.
[04:22.120 --> 04:23.640]  I'm saying that.
[04:23.640 --> 04:29.440]  They said they got intel that they had plans to kill senior diplomats and U.S. officials.
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.960]  Well, who's more senior than the puppet Biden?
[04:32.960 --> 04:41.880]  And then I saw the other headline on infowars.com that he's going to Europe for the NATO summit.
[04:41.880 --> 04:46.480]  This is when you get a missile fired or a car bomb, something like that.
[04:46.480 --> 04:51.080]  And then they'll claim it's some multinational pro-Russia group that's involved in it.
[04:51.080 --> 04:53.240]  And then we're off the races, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:53.240 --> 04:56.400]  We need to pray for Joe Biden's safety.
[04:56.400 --> 05:01.200]  Pray with us.
[05:01.200 --> 05:08.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20
[05:08.480 --> 05:14.400]  year history, and that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding,
[05:14.400 --> 05:20.520]  the supply chains have broken down, and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll
[05:20.520 --> 05:25.200]  and paying for operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.080]  globalist making their main move.
[05:27.080 --> 05:30.080]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[05:30.080 --> 05:33.280]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[05:33.280 --> 05:36.760]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[05:36.760 --> 05:40.640]  our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[05:59.040 --> 06:13.320]  Thank you for your support.
[06:13.320 --> 06:32.440]  On the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.440]  March 20th.
[06:33.440 --> 06:36.320]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday Transmission.
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.240]  I am your host, Alex Jones, we're going to be live here for the next four hours this
[06:41.240 --> 06:42.240]  evening.
[06:42.240 --> 06:44.960]  This is going to be an incredibly important transmission.
[06:44.960 --> 06:47.080]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:47.080 --> 06:50.400]  All right, here's where we are.
[06:50.400 --> 06:56.760]  The planets have aligned politically, militarily, economically, and everybody keeps asking the
[06:56.760 --> 07:03.000]  question how can Biden, who can't finish a sentence, how can Biden, who has under 30%
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.160]  approval ratings, even in cooked polls that are pro-democrat, means his real approval
[07:08.160 --> 07:10.080]  is about 15%.
[07:10.080 --> 07:14.360]  How can the deep state grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[07:14.360 --> 07:19.480]  And I've said this over and over again the last year, assassinate Biden, I'm not calling
[07:19.480 --> 07:25.120]  for assassinating Biden, but the globalists wind up some lunatic, have the security stand
[07:25.120 --> 07:31.880]  down, or detonate a truck mom, or poisoning, there's a million ways to do it, and then
[07:31.880 --> 07:35.360]  blame it on their political enemies, or just say he died in his sleep.
[07:35.360 --> 07:38.880]  Because then that turns him into a victim, and now there's a big funeral, and now they
[07:38.880 --> 07:42.040]  can slip in the next puppets that they want into place.
[07:42.040 --> 07:47.200]  But you talk about dumb, dumber, and even more dumb, if he dies, then you get Kamala
[07:47.200 --> 07:54.440]  Harris, and then after him rolls in the Speaker of the House, and you know who that is, Nancy
[07:54.440 --> 07:56.880]  Pelosi.
[07:56.880 --> 08:01.160]  And these old cryptkeepers, these skexies, are not going to turn loose of power.
[08:01.160 --> 08:08.360]  So I've really been talking about the danger of them assassinating Biden the last year.
[08:08.360 --> 08:14.560]  It's the only way it fits, so that they can, again, push forward their agenda.
[08:14.560 --> 08:18.120]  And my mother hardly ever gets in my face about something, but when she does, she's
[08:18.120 --> 08:23.080]  always right, and she's been ranting for a good six months when I see her that they're
[08:23.080 --> 08:24.600]  going to kill Biden.
[08:24.600 --> 08:28.760]  She just sees it in all the tea leaves, she sees it in the preparation, she sees it all
[08:28.760 --> 08:32.600]  over the place, and my mom and dad are just as smart as I am, and I've always had a lot
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.760]  of foresight.
[08:34.760 --> 08:36.520]  But I think a lot of you see this as well.
[08:36.520 --> 08:39.000]  I mean, how do they get rid of him?
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  Does he step down?
[08:40.000 --> 08:41.000]  No, he'll never do that.
[08:41.000 --> 08:45.200]  He'll still be seen as evil and corrupt, and all the bad things he's done, he'll still
[08:45.200 --> 08:46.200]  get the blame for.
[08:46.200 --> 08:51.000]  But if he's assassinated, they can demonize their political opposition, and they can expand
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.640]  wars, and they can have the giant police state they've set up as a bear trap closed on our
[08:55.640 --> 08:56.640]  leg.
[08:56.640 --> 09:02.680]  And then I saw these big articles today on infowars.com.
[09:02.680 --> 09:10.520]  Your advisor to Zelensky invites Biden to Kiev next week if he's brave when the commander
[09:10.520 --> 09:14.640]  in chief visits Europe for NATO summit next week.
[09:14.640 --> 09:19.720]  Ukrainian official number two under Zelensky invited President Joe Biden to visit Kiev
[09:19.720 --> 09:20.720]  next week.
[09:20.720 --> 09:25.800]  I mean, Russia's ongoing invasion of the country saying one should not be afraid if you're
[09:25.800 --> 09:26.800]  brave.
[09:26.800 --> 09:31.960]  So Zelensky's cheap diplomatic advisor.
[09:31.960 --> 09:40.240]  So if you're brave Caesar, you'll go during the Ides of March to the Roman Forum.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.240]  You'll be safe there.
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.120]  You know what happened to him.
[09:43.120 --> 09:48.680]  Warning, global deep state may be planning assassination of President Biden when he travels
[09:48.680 --> 09:49.680]  Europe next week.
[09:49.680 --> 09:55.600]  An excellent article that Jamie White and I put together this morning that deals with
[09:55.600 --> 10:00.720]  all of this and gives you some historical examples of what's been going on and unfolding,
[10:00.720 --> 10:08.120]  including how World War I started in 1914 when groups connected to the British Secret
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.160]  Service of the Black Hand subgroup, Serbia's Black Hand connected to the British Secret
[10:13.160 --> 10:20.160]  Service assassinated the king of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which of course Germany was the capital
[10:20.160 --> 10:23.680]  of, Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.040]  So that's a big deal.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.440]  All the same parallels of that war.
[10:30.440 --> 10:32.120]  And why are we talking about that?
[10:32.120 --> 10:38.360]  Well, again, Biden's traveling to NATO next week, Brussels, Belgium, and we've got the
[10:38.360 --> 10:45.640]  Russians warning and saying that they have intercepted and arrested Canadian intelligence
[10:45.640 --> 10:52.400]  operatives high level that tell them that is the next big shoot to drop.
[10:52.400 --> 11:01.120]  There are plans to assassinate American officials and leaders to be blamed on Russia.
[11:01.120 --> 11:03.240]  Now would Russia assassinate U.S. leaders?
[11:03.240 --> 11:06.000]  No, that would blow up in their face.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.840]  Would Russia have a motive to kill U.S. leaders?
[11:08.840 --> 11:09.840]  Absolutely not.
[11:09.840 --> 11:11.200]  They would turn them into the devil overnight.
[11:11.200 --> 11:12.200]  That's the worst possible move.
[11:12.200 --> 11:14.760]  Well, then who has a motive to kill U.S. diplomats?
[11:14.760 --> 11:17.640]  Who has a motive to kill?
[11:17.640 --> 11:22.520]  Well, you know who, the Deep State.
[11:22.520 --> 11:26.280]  They have the motive for all of that.
[11:26.280 --> 11:33.000]  And so I see that as them killing two birds with one stone and is a very, very serious
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.680]  concern to me.
[11:36.680 --> 11:37.680]  Let me go ahead and just do this.
[11:37.680 --> 11:43.480]  Let me just go ahead and read this article from M4Wars.com as it covers all the facts.
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.080]  Warning, global Deep State may be planning assassination of President Biden when he travels
[11:47.080 --> 11:48.080]  to Europe next week.
[11:48.080 --> 11:53.040]  Russia has warned Zelenskyi government planning false flag against U.S. government leaders
[11:53.040 --> 11:54.840]  in pretext to expand war.
[11:54.840 --> 11:59.000]  Joe Biden has become a liability for the global Deep State, which is why they may try to have
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.880]  him assassinated as a way to accelerate a world war against Russia.
[12:05.880 --> 12:10.560]  Ukraine President Zelenskyi, chief of medic advisor on Saturday, asked Biden to visit
[12:10.560 --> 12:15.240]  the embattled city of Kiev next week during his trip to Brussels, saying in a taunting
[12:15.240 --> 12:20.720]  message, one should not be afraid to, if you are brave, close quote, inviting a sitting
[12:20.720 --> 12:24.400]  president to an active war zone is probably not the wisest idea.
[12:24.400 --> 12:27.400]  Yeah, anybody asking you to do it wants you to get killed.
[12:27.400 --> 12:31.320]  Coincidentally, this comes amid reports by the Russian military that they have received
[12:31.320 --> 12:38.040]  intelligence of Ukrainian nationalist hardliners planning to target U.S. and Western military
[12:38.040 --> 12:39.040]  installations.
[12:39.040 --> 12:47.480]  The officer spoke about a planned terrorist acts in Lvov, the city's Russian language
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.000]  name against employees and facilities of the diplomatic missions maintained by the U.S.
[12:52.000 --> 12:58.360]  other Western nations, said Russia's defense minister, Major General Igor, I'm not gonna
[12:58.360 --> 12:59.920]  butcher that.
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.680]  What's more, the Ukrainian government is apparently aware of this plot, but is doing
[13:03.680 --> 13:04.680]  nothing to stop it.
[13:04.680 --> 13:11.960]  I like to stress that Kiev regime is fully aware of the plans abroad by nationalists,
[13:11.960 --> 13:17.840]  but is doing nothing to prevent them, he said, the plans being harbored by nationalists.
[13:17.840 --> 13:24.120]  The state, when the stage appears to be set to have Biden assassinated during his diplomatic
[13:24.120 --> 13:28.360]  visit to Europe, such a scenario would echo the prairie to World War One, where Austrian
[13:28.360 --> 13:34.080]  Archduke, Franz Ferdinand's assassination by Serbian's blackhand terrorist 1914 was actually
[13:34.080 --> 13:36.240]  orchestrated by British Secret Service.
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.840]  Biden's assassination could potentially be extremely useful to globalists, not just
[13:39.840 --> 13:45.080]  as a spark for global war, but also alleviate political fallout for Democrats in America.
[13:45.080 --> 13:49.360]  The Democrats are getting dragged down politically because of Biden's terrible polling due to
[13:49.360 --> 13:54.000]  disastrous radical domestic and foreign policy positions.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.120]  Racing for massive losses in the incoming midterms, Democrats have even been discussing
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.560]  amongst themselves how best to replace Biden before 2024.
[14:03.560 --> 14:09.080]  At this point, the globalist, Biden is now more useful dead than alive, which is a precarious
[14:09.080 --> 14:12.160]  situation for the whole world.
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.480]  However, in a veiled response to Ukraine's request, Biden's press secretary Jen Psaki
[14:17.480 --> 14:22.360]  said Sunday that Biden would not travel to Ukraine during his visit to Brussels.
[14:22.360 --> 14:28.560]  Biden is instead scheduled to appear at NATO's meeting to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.600]  efforts against Russia, and the G7 meeting with European leaders, hopefully his bumbling
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.840]  European visit will go off without a hitch.
[14:37.840 --> 14:42.400]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, hopefully nothing happens to the satanic pedophile version
[14:42.400 --> 14:45.240]  of Dr. Magoo or Mr. Magoo.
[14:45.240 --> 14:51.000]  Here's the big article, Russia warns of false flag attacks on U.S. triple maps.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.960]  You should go read the article for yourself on infowars.com.
[14:55.960 --> 15:00.640]  Some good news, Ukraine and Russia, close to agreement on critical issues, Turkey says.
[15:00.640 --> 15:02.720]  We'll see if that turns out to be true.
[15:02.720 --> 15:07.720]  NATO should not expand to the east, says top Chinese implement, a day after Xi and Biden
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  had talks.
[15:08.720 --> 15:14.960]  Russian defense ministers has over 100 Ukrainian covert, op troops, and foreign mercenaries
[15:14.960 --> 15:20.960]  eliminated West of Kiev in a huge weapon cache that the West admits was blown up.
[15:20.960 --> 15:28.240]  One article at Zero Hedge by Chris Hedges also on infowars, waltzing towards Armageddon.
[15:28.240 --> 15:29.720]  You need to go read this article.
[15:29.720 --> 15:31.320]  This is very balanced and very accurate.
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.960]  There's another video we're going to be playing coming up with the great Laura Logan knocking
[15:35.960 --> 15:37.840]  it out of the park explaining what's really going on.
[15:37.840 --> 15:39.960]  That's coming up as well with so much more.
[15:39.960 --> 15:44.560]  Meanwhile, we've got all these former war criminal presidents calling for a big war
[15:44.560 --> 15:49.720]  against Russia, Bush, Clinton, and Obama.
[15:49.720 --> 15:56.120]  We got video of that next segment and then giant COVID news, economy news, censorship
[15:56.120 --> 16:00.120]  news and more.
[16:00.120 --> 16:01.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.240]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.280]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[16:09.280 --> 16:10.480]  I was born for this.
[16:10.480 --> 16:11.480]  You were born for this.
[16:11.480 --> 16:16.320]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.680]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.360]  And now with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[16:25.360 --> 16:31.280]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[16:31.280 --> 16:32.280]  of charge.
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.040]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22.
[16:37.040 --> 16:41.520]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[16:41.520 --> 16:42.520]  movement worldwide.
[16:42.520 --> 16:48.240]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[16:48.240 --> 16:49.640]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[16:49.640 --> 16:53.960]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[16:53.960 --> 16:59.360]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[16:59.360 --> 17:03.800]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[17:03.800 --> 17:05.160]  I like going to concerts.
[17:05.160 --> 17:06.520]  I like going to play golf.
[17:06.520 --> 17:07.920]  I like going out to dinner.
[17:07.920 --> 17:09.960]  I like the metropolitan life.
[17:09.960 --> 17:15.520]  I like everything that comes with this, but see, I have the survival instinct that is
[17:15.520 --> 17:21.400]  to get the hell out of Democrat run cities, get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[17:21.400 --> 17:24.440]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[17:24.440 --> 17:26.360]  Is it time to just move out to the woods?
[17:26.360 --> 17:29.960]  Is it time to go get a piece of property in the woods, just get off grid, just get the
[17:29.960 --> 17:32.400]  emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[17:32.400 --> 17:33.600]  That's the survival instinct.
[17:33.600 --> 17:37.320]  But see the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no,
[17:37.320 --> 17:39.360]  no, no, no, stay in the city.
[17:39.360 --> 17:42.760]  The survival instinct says get the hell out of anywhere there, whatever notion that you
[17:42.760 --> 17:44.560]  need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[17:44.560 --> 17:50.040]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing
[17:50.040 --> 17:51.040]  as well.
[17:51.040 --> 17:55.640]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[17:55.640 --> 17:57.840]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[17:57.840 --> 18:18.840]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking
[18:18.840 --> 18:19.840]  about.
[18:19.840 --> 18:40.840]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking
[18:40.840 --> 18:41.840]  about.
[18:41.840 --> 19:07.840]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking
[19:07.840 --> 19:08.840]  about.
[19:08.840 --> 19:34.840]  That's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking about, that's what I'm talking
[19:34.840 --> 20:00.840]  about, that's what I'm talking about.
[20:00.840 --> 20:27.240]  That's what I'm talking about.
[20:30.840 --> 20:43.560]  If I tried to go over all the fake war propaganda put out by Zelensky and Ukraine, we would
[20:43.560 --> 20:46.520]  never have enough time on air to play it all or go over it all.
[20:46.520 --> 20:49.360]  And the Russians have lied as well.
[20:49.360 --> 20:51.880]  That's what happens to these type of wars.
[20:51.880 --> 20:55.080]  The Russians lied about invading, the Russians lied about the time of the invasion, they
[20:55.080 --> 20:58.360]  lied about how big the invasion would be, because you definitely want to lie if you're
[20:58.360 --> 21:01.000]  about to invade somebody, you don't want them to know.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.600]  So let's make no mistake, the Russians aren't little saints here either.
[21:04.600 --> 21:09.760]  But the way our media says Zelensky and the Ukrainians are saints, when it comes to lying,
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.000]  it's the slickest, most orchestrated thing I've ever seen, because it's being run by
[21:14.000 --> 21:15.500]  the CIA.
[21:15.500 --> 21:19.160]  And I told you that a month ago, I told you that years ago, because it's on record.
[21:19.160 --> 21:25.200]  But now even the CIA was in Yahoo and Bloomberg, as you know last week, bragging that they
[21:25.200 --> 21:33.120]  helped overthrow the elected Ukrainian government in 2014, and bragging they'd been in a proxy
[21:33.120 --> 21:37.960]  war on the border with Russia, killing Russians ever since.
[21:37.960 --> 21:41.640]  I don't want my government and my country doing covert wars.
[21:41.640 --> 21:44.680]  The CIA has overthrown hundreds of countries.
[21:44.680 --> 21:47.360]  The Russians have overthrown a couple dozen.
[21:47.360 --> 21:51.360]  They tried to compete with us and they couldn't even do it.
[21:51.360 --> 21:55.180]  And what's our government put in, authoritarian groups?
[21:55.180 --> 21:58.680]  Zelensky just banned 11 opposition parties.
[21:58.680 --> 22:05.560]  He banned all opposition parties, pro-Russia, anti-Russia, liberal, conservative, Christian,
[22:05.560 --> 22:07.840]  Catholic, banned.
[22:07.840 --> 22:10.160]  He's a dictator.
[22:10.160 --> 22:15.280]  The Nazis banned all parties, but they're a party.
[22:15.280 --> 22:18.640]  And Putin's done a lot of stuff too, authoritarian censorship.
[22:18.640 --> 22:23.640]  But compared to Zelensky, well, he can't hold a candle up.
[22:23.640 --> 22:27.520]  And the left's like, yeah, ban everybody, he's so great.
[22:27.520 --> 22:33.600]  And I've got stacks of articles and videos here where they have famous models and famous
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.160]  actors in Eastern Europe.
[22:37.160 --> 22:42.920]  I mean, Zelensky himself is the famous guy that would do drag queen shows and gay bonded
[22:42.920 --> 22:43.920]  shows.
[22:43.920 --> 22:45.720]  I mean, that's why they have him compromised and controlled.
[22:45.720 --> 22:47.560]  Not the first time we've seen this.
[22:47.560 --> 22:52.600]  You see him dancing in the leather high heels and leather outfits, shaking his ass.
[22:52.600 --> 22:59.640]  But I got stacks of articles here of well-known Ukrainian actresses posing as pregnant women,
[22:59.640 --> 23:00.640]  posing as dead women.
[23:00.640 --> 23:05.120]  I mean, they don't even care because it's for the rest of the world.
[23:05.120 --> 23:08.240]  And I've got them right here in my stack.
[23:08.240 --> 23:14.560]  So that's insulting to me to hear from CNN and ABC News and to hear from the Democratic
[23:14.560 --> 23:19.560]  Party and the neocons like Mitt Romney that if you question anything like Laura Logan
[23:19.560 --> 23:28.560]  does or Alex Jones does or Peter Carlson does or Tulsi Gabbard's does, you are a traitor.
[23:28.560 --> 23:33.600]  It's treason to not want war with Russia.
[23:33.600 --> 23:36.800]  What it is is insanity and totally mindless.
[23:36.800 --> 23:42.160]  So here's a clip from MSNBC and they've got all these state department officials and
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.160]  others on them.
[23:43.160 --> 23:47.920]  This is part of the whole piece of how they're the best and their propaganda is the best.
[23:47.920 --> 23:49.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[23:49.440 --> 23:52.000]  So we have a right and a duty to question it.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.280]  And all my goal here is to just lay everything out the best I can and tell you what I really
[23:56.280 --> 23:57.280]  think is going on.
[23:57.280 --> 24:00.920]  And we've got a much better track record mainstream media, which shouldn't be hard.
[24:00.920 --> 24:03.040]  They try to lie to you.
[24:03.040 --> 24:06.360]  I don't condescend to you like you need me to tell you what to do.
[24:06.360 --> 24:10.600]  I'm going to lay out my best thinking, the best info I've got, lay out the different
[24:10.600 --> 24:15.640]  options and take your calls and have guests on that bring up other options.
[24:15.640 --> 24:22.320]  And we're right 98% of the time or so.
[24:22.320 --> 24:27.760]  So here they are bragging that Zelensky's got the best propaganda.
[24:27.760 --> 24:30.760]  You also have to figure out a way to tell people about it, right?
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.600]  And I think the way in which this small team of mostly ex television producers who worked
[24:36.600 --> 24:43.520]  with him for years in Ukraine have kind of fashioned the most sophisticated political
[24:43.520 --> 24:47.760]  communications operation I've ever seen in real time.
[24:47.760 --> 24:52.600]  Every single choice they've made has been brilliant and pitch perfect.
[24:52.600 --> 24:53.600]  And they have played it.
[24:53.600 --> 24:57.960]  They understand that in this world we now live in, there's very complicated, fragmented
[24:57.960 --> 25:02.360]  media landscape we occupy that you got to play it high and low.
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.560]  You got to play insurgent and establishment.
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.200]  You got to do the interview with Lester Holtz, but you also got to be on TikTok.
[25:08.200 --> 25:10.360]  You got to be everywhere all at once.
[25:10.360 --> 25:12.920]  He's out there speaking English, speaking Russian.
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.920]  He's transmitting on telegram all day long, messages to different audiences.
[25:16.920 --> 25:22.480]  And then this week we saw him do this global tour for hearts and minds, you know, the spring
[25:22.480 --> 25:26.480]  training games in Canada and the British parliament and then coming to the big stage
[25:26.480 --> 25:27.480]  of America.
[25:27.480 --> 25:34.160]  And again, with a perfectly executed 16 minute speech with video in the middle of it and
[25:34.160 --> 25:39.000]  a switch to English on the back end, I still think I've ever seen anything more masterful
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.960]  at the level of performance, not just the performance again, got to be a hero to look
[25:43.960 --> 25:44.960]  like a hero.
[25:44.960 --> 25:48.200]  But man, he's done an incredible, he and his team have done an incredible job making
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.080]  the case for their people and using every media tool and understanding the world we
[25:54.080 --> 25:58.000]  now live in in terms of media and digital technology as well as anybody I think ever
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.960]  that we've seen, that we've ever seen.
[26:00.960 --> 26:03.000]  So that's called gushing.
[26:03.000 --> 26:06.120]  And that's them telling you what they're doing and how they're doing it.
[26:06.120 --> 26:09.240]  And again, the CIA and the news going, yeah, we overthrew their government.
[26:09.240 --> 26:11.600]  Yeah, we're in a war with the Russians.
[26:11.600 --> 26:13.400]  And so does that legitimize what Putin did?
[26:13.400 --> 26:14.880]  No, but you see why he did it.
[26:14.880 --> 26:15.960]  We would do that.
[26:15.960 --> 26:20.040]  I don't want a war, but it's just bull.
[26:20.040 --> 26:22.920]  And then like, oh, look, the Russians can't get their propaganda together.
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.440]  Oh, look, the Russians, you know, their military isn't that powerful.
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.560]  Putin's already said that.
[26:30.560 --> 26:32.320]  He said, we don't want to fight you.
[26:32.320 --> 26:35.320]  They've cut their defense spending massively in the last decade.
[26:35.320 --> 26:38.000]  They said, we're not in arms race with you, but you're not moving weapons on our
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  border.
[26:39.000 --> 26:43.080]  And I got to tell the left out there, the average real liberal is against this war
[26:43.080 --> 26:46.240]  and every conservative I know is against it as well.
[26:46.240 --> 26:50.400]  And people are so sick of our government and see it as so evil that almost everyone
[26:50.400 --> 26:55.120]  I know is pro-Putin, I mean, just everybody, liberal, conservative, old, young.
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.960]  So their masterful propaganda has failed.
[26:57.960 --> 27:03.120]  I personally am horrified by this whole thing and think Putin got tricked into a trap and
[27:03.120 --> 27:07.880]  they're having to admit that and he's getting general slaughtered and it's a set up and
[27:07.880 --> 27:14.400]  the CIA is jamming their communications and flooding the zone with high tech weapons.
[27:14.400 --> 27:17.000]  And so now this is just going to escalate.
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.920]  So this is not good for anybody except the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[27:20.920 --> 27:25.880]  Now I got some big clips about the first casualty of war being the truth and about the massive
[27:25.880 --> 27:27.640]  censorship here in America.
[27:27.640 --> 27:32.400]  Now it ties into the huge revelations with Hunter Biden's laptop.
[27:32.400 --> 27:36.520]  That's coming up next segment and then later I'm going to show you some of the photos and
[27:36.520 --> 27:39.520]  some of the articles where they admit it's fake.
[27:39.520 --> 27:45.560]  You know, not just the ghost of Kiev being fake, not just Snake Island being fake, not
[27:45.560 --> 27:51.120]  just so much of this being fake or the Ukrainian militias hiding in hospitals and schools which
[27:51.120 --> 27:57.080]  they admit they're doing, those are war crimes right there, but the lying and having the
[27:57.080 --> 28:04.760]  actresses and the actors on record and then admitting that they've got actors out doing
[28:04.760 --> 28:05.760]  it.
[28:05.760 --> 28:06.760]  We're not denying there's a war.
[28:06.760 --> 28:11.280]  We're not denying people are dying, but they are TV producing this and showing old war
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.880]  footage of him from TV shows he was in as if it's real.
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.880]  They are scripting and producing this.
[28:16.880 --> 28:20.560]  You just saw MSNBC say it.
[28:20.560 --> 28:27.040]  And so this is a very dangerous propaganda game that these individuals are running here.
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.400]  So we're going to go to break, come back with all this and more, infowars.com, tomorrow's
[28:31.400 --> 28:32.400]  news today.
[28:32.400 --> 28:37.720]  We have Alex Stein, the guy with the mega viral wrapping videos at city councils joining
[28:37.720 --> 28:38.720]  us in studio.
[28:38.720 --> 28:45.000]  Cover a lot of serious news, also a very serious fellow, not just the funny side, runs the
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  conspiracy castle.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.240]  Now I'm going to be hosting third and fourth hour with just jam packed information as well.
[28:50.240 --> 28:51.240]  Please stay with us.
[28:51.240 --> 28:54.600]  This is listener participation radio.
[28:54.600 --> 29:00.000]  Please help us get past the sensors, share the links to Band-Aid video.
[29:00.000 --> 29:08.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowars.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[29:08.880 --> 29:13.800]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[29:13.800 --> 29:19.720]  are broken down and info wars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[29:19.720 --> 29:20.720]  operations.
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.760]  We do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalist making their main move.
[29:25.760 --> 29:29.800]  In full wars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people
[29:29.800 --> 29:31.960]  than ever despite the censorship.
[29:31.960 --> 29:35.520]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for
[29:35.520 --> 29:39.400]  our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[29:39.400 --> 29:46.440]  So listen, up to 75% off infowars.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread
[29:46.440 --> 29:53.440]  the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75%
[29:53.440 --> 29:54.440]  off right now.
[29:54.440 --> 29:57.840]  The biggest sell in our history at infowars.com.
[29:57.840 --> 30:00.760]  Thank you for your support.
[30:00.760 --> 30:06.160]  It's only been in the last 60 years that we've had satellites that can decently measure what's
[30:06.160 --> 30:07.160]  happening in the atmosphere.
[30:07.160 --> 30:11.480]  But if you look at all the different studies and reports about my NASA and other governments
[30:11.480 --> 30:16.040]  and other agencies, they all disagree on what's really happening with the client.
[30:16.040 --> 30:21.640]  The only constant, the only great truth is, change is the only constant.
[30:21.640 --> 30:24.040]  So yes, climate change is totally real.
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.240]  But notice, first they called it global freezing back in the 70s and 80s and then it's gonna
[30:28.240 --> 30:31.560]  be global warming and when that didn't really happen the way they wanted it to, okay, now
[30:31.560 --> 30:32.800]  it's just climate change.
[30:32.800 --> 30:38.760]  But did you know that manmade climate change is a real thing when it comes to the United
[30:38.760 --> 30:42.680]  Nations and the Department of Energy and Bill Gates and the UN?
[30:42.680 --> 30:43.680]  They have.
[30:43.680 --> 30:48.520]  They control trees from 1979 and Bill Gates has been manipulating the weather for a very
[30:48.520 --> 30:49.520]  long time.
[30:49.520 --> 30:53.720]  In fact, back in 1974, two scientists won a Nobel Prize for an idea of spraying different
[30:53.720 --> 30:56.440]  particles out of jet engines to control the weather.
[30:56.440 --> 30:59.440]  So yes, manmade climate change is real.
[30:59.440 --> 31:02.280]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[31:02.280 --> 31:07.440]  They're here all over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[31:07.440 --> 31:11.400]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, then coming to your house
[31:11.400 --> 31:17.880]  and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[31:17.880 --> 31:22.440]  And they're planning the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[31:22.440 --> 31:26.440]  quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[31:26.440 --> 31:28.240]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[31:28.240 --> 31:32.480]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[31:32.480 --> 31:36.760]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[31:36.760 --> 31:39.360]  grade at infowarstore.com.

[32:00.440 --> 32:04.600]  The eugenicists over 100 years ago were very public about their plans.
[32:04.600 --> 32:10.200]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[32:10.200 --> 32:14.760]  their propaganda of the New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family, as we know
[32:14.760 --> 32:17.360]  it, is a bad thing and must be ended.
[32:17.360 --> 32:22.880]  And the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching women that
[32:22.880 --> 32:26.880]  cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing.
[32:26.880 --> 32:31.280]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four and a half
[32:31.280 --> 32:34.800]  years old daughter, my wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well,
[32:34.800 --> 32:35.800]  I love to make breakfast.
[32:35.800 --> 32:40.040]  And literally, it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[32:40.040 --> 32:44.200]  nurturative and then all sit down together and have that communal event.
[32:44.200 --> 32:50.440]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[32:50.440 --> 32:51.440]  and coming together.
[32:51.440 --> 32:56.760]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and
[32:56.760 --> 32:57.760]  turn us into lab rats.
[32:57.760 --> 33:26.760]  We cannot let this continue.
[33:27.760 --> 33:34.760]  Welcome back, my friends.
[33:34.760 --> 33:39.400]  Let's drill more into this Russia situation that is a black hole threatening to engulf
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.640]  the entire world economy and all of our speech as well as one of the big casualties of war
[33:45.640 --> 33:48.840]  is also people's freedoms, not just the truth.
[33:48.840 --> 33:55.880]  But Zelensky, who we're told is the most wonderful person the world has ever seen when he was
[33:55.880 --> 34:09.080]  not doing leather gay bondage shows or transvestite tranny shows on national Ukrainian television.
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.800]  And my point is, he's come out and said, oh, the Russians, they've hacked computers and
[34:14.800 --> 34:19.840]  they're probably about to release me and gay porn, it's not real.
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.160]  Why do you think Arnold Schwarzenegger always comes out for the wars and says screw your
[34:24.160 --> 34:26.720]  freedom and does all this?
[34:26.720 --> 34:32.440]  Pornography with him is in the Getty Collection on record, 35 millimeter film, all of it.
[34:32.440 --> 34:35.240]  I made a documentary and did some research on Schwarzenegger.
[34:35.240 --> 34:41.200]  He's about 20 minutes of it and that stuff's out there and I've seen it, okay?
[34:41.200 --> 34:45.880]  Now the point is, they'll put that all over the news and then his tough guy image is gone
[34:45.880 --> 34:52.200]  if you see Arnold Schwarzenegger sucking men off and all the rest of it.
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.640]  And so, you know, I made a film about that, I talked about it, Schwarzenegger didn't
[34:55.640 --> 34:56.640]  sue me, did he?
[34:56.640 --> 34:58.800]  Because he's blackmailed.
[34:58.800 --> 34:59.800]  And listen, here's the issue.
[34:59.800 --> 35:03.720]  I'm not against Schwarzenegger that he made a bunch of his money when bodybuilding wasn't
[35:03.720 --> 35:07.640]  huge before he made money with Weeder on supplements.
[35:07.640 --> 35:12.440]  They helped pioneer that because he made money doing that.
[35:12.440 --> 35:13.640]  I'm not putting him down.
[35:13.640 --> 35:14.760]  I'm not judging him.
[35:14.760 --> 35:19.600]  The point is, he's compromised and it's the same thing with Zelensky.
[35:19.600 --> 35:21.800]  He's compromised.
[35:21.800 --> 35:27.320]  And so everything this guy does is scripted, ladies and gentlemen, Zelensky says World
[35:27.320 --> 35:31.400]  War III assured if negotiations with Russia break down.
[35:31.400 --> 35:34.360]  I didn't just believe zero hedge when I saw that.
[35:34.360 --> 35:36.840]  That's in the British and the U.S. News now.
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.040]  He said World War III is going to happen if you don't escalate a war that could cause
[35:41.040 --> 35:43.880]  World War III.
[35:43.880 --> 35:44.880]  Unbelievable information.
[35:44.880 --> 35:46.400]  And then here's some of the photos I showed you.
[35:46.400 --> 35:51.080]  Here's some of the famous models and that's why they hate me talking about crisis actors.
[35:51.080 --> 35:53.040]  Is every event a crisis actor?
[35:53.040 --> 35:54.040]  No.
[35:54.040 --> 35:55.040]  Is every event staged?
[35:55.040 --> 35:56.040]  No.
[35:56.040 --> 35:59.320]  But have there been a lot of cases where the U.N. got caught in serious staging chemical
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.920]  attacks that turned out to be fake confirmed with the kids on TV that were in the video
[36:02.920 --> 36:05.640]  saying they weren't hired to do it?
[36:05.640 --> 36:08.880]  Yes.
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.400]  Famous actress, famous model dressing up like she's pregnant in one shot and bombed
[36:13.400 --> 36:14.680]  out of a building in another.
[36:14.680 --> 36:19.160]  And you look at these photos, you can see they're fake to begin with.
[36:19.160 --> 36:22.240]  So when the Russians bomb a military base or whatever, they just have these folks go
[36:22.240 --> 36:27.000]  and crawl around the rubble and act like they've been hurt because the Russians are not trying
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.600]  to target civilian infrastructure.
[36:28.600 --> 36:34.080]  That's just a fact because they know it makes them look bad.
[36:34.080 --> 36:41.600]  Now I want to hit some really, really important news here that deals with all of this and
[36:41.600 --> 36:42.600]  deals with disinformation.
[36:42.600 --> 36:48.440]  And I want to look at what this is doing to the economy and why the globalists are pushing
[36:48.440 --> 36:54.280]  it so hard and what oil barons are making money and what oil companies are losing money
[36:54.280 --> 37:02.120]  in this whole artificial energy crisis where the U.N. is now saying take away beef, take
[37:02.120 --> 37:06.520]  away plentiful chicken, take away fish, take away everything but bugs.
[37:06.520 --> 37:07.520]  You knew it was coming.
[37:07.520 --> 37:09.920]  They told you you'll eat bugs and love it, you'll own nothing and like it.
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.040]  It's now official the U.N. and the Democratic Party and Bloomberg News is all saying and
[37:15.040 --> 37:21.960]  Sky News is all saying that you cannot have cars, you cannot have beef and beef is racist.
[37:21.960 --> 37:23.960]  That's all coming up next segment.
[37:23.960 --> 37:28.120]  But let's get to some of these clips talking about disinformation.
[37:28.120 --> 37:35.000]  Here is the New York Times in a big article that got praised by CNN and Reason and everybody
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  else.
[37:36.000 --> 37:43.920]  America has a free speech problem and it shows an evil drain that is asking questions.
[37:43.920 --> 37:49.560]  It says asking questions is bad and it's a mind drain and it goes on to say New York
[37:49.560 --> 37:55.240]  Times deserves free speech but Alex Jones does not specifically.
[37:55.240 --> 37:56.760]  They get their speech.
[37:56.760 --> 37:59.920]  They can say whatever they want about Sarah Palin that they knew they were lying about
[37:59.920 --> 38:05.320]  but if Alex Jones might make a mistake and ever admit it, he's got to be taken off air
[38:05.320 --> 38:06.320]  forever.
[38:06.320 --> 38:10.560]  Oh, the New York Times admits that America has a free speech problem.
[38:10.560 --> 38:14.120]  Oh, the praise from the news.
[38:14.120 --> 38:17.160]  Oh, but here's the New York Post, spies who lie.
[38:17.160 --> 38:22.120]  The intelligence experts who falsely discredited Hunter Biden's laptop and still won't say
[38:22.120 --> 38:23.120]  sorry.
[38:23.120 --> 38:29.440]  Well, of course not because the Hunter Biden thing was open and shut from the local store
[38:29.440 --> 38:30.880]  where he left it, never got it.
[38:30.880 --> 38:31.880]  State police had it.
[38:31.880 --> 38:32.880]  Feds had it.
[38:32.880 --> 38:33.880]  Everybody saw it.
[38:33.880 --> 38:38.000]  Everybody had copies of it and it was him having sex with children.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.880]  You can't have that, that's used to blackmail Biden and others to control them just like
[38:42.880 --> 38:51.960]  Zelensky's blackmailed with all of his escapades reportedly being a nude dancer at a gay bar.
[38:51.960 --> 38:54.480]  So let's go to these clips.
[38:54.480 --> 39:00.080]  Here's the media pun is telling you the laptop didn't exist or was Russian disinfo and then
[39:00.080 --> 39:03.720]  we have some of the latest developments on that front.
[39:03.720 --> 39:06.400]  Biden's secret emails are really fishy story.
[39:06.400 --> 39:11.000]  The Post claimed that the emails were found on a laptop computer that was brought to repair
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.440]  shop in Delaware in the spring of 2019.
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.480]  The FBI is now investigating whether those alleged Hunter Biden emails are actually connected
[39:17.480 --> 39:20.080]  to a larger foreign intelligence operation.
[39:20.080 --> 39:26.120]  They may be related to a foreign intelligence operation.
[39:26.120 --> 39:27.120]  Foreign intelligence.
[39:27.120 --> 39:28.120]  Foreign intelligence.
[39:28.120 --> 39:29.120]  Foreign intelligence operation.
[39:29.120 --> 39:31.640]  For all we know, these emails are made up.
[39:31.640 --> 39:37.040]  The information found on the laptop may be part of a Russian disinformation campaign.
[39:37.040 --> 39:42.680]  Part of a Russian disinformation effort described by many intelligence experts as having hallmarks
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.520]  all the hallmarks rather all the hallmarks of a Russian Russian Russian disinformation
[39:47.520 --> 39:49.920]  Russian disinformation disinformation campaign.
[39:49.920 --> 39:55.640]  This is a classic example of the right wing media machine.
[39:55.640 --> 39:58.120]  And here is a flashback.
[39:58.120 --> 40:03.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, when Trump brought it up, he was told, you're Russian disinformation.
[40:03.080 --> 40:04.080]  It doesn't exist.
[40:04.080 --> 40:07.200]  Even though they always knew it was real, it was always certified as real.
[40:07.200 --> 40:08.720]  The FBI admitted it was real.
[40:08.720 --> 40:09.720]  But it mattered.
[40:09.720 --> 40:15.240]  Mainstream media would lie and then the Internet, the corporate giants, big tech would censor
[40:15.240 --> 40:17.640]  anybody that talked about it.
[40:17.640 --> 40:24.000]  Our 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what this he's accusing me of is
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.920]  a Russian plan.
[40:25.920 --> 40:32.440]  They have said that this is has all the four, five former heads of the CIA, both parties
[40:32.440 --> 40:35.800]  say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.
[40:35.800 --> 40:39.720]  Nobody believes it except of his and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani.
[40:39.720 --> 40:43.480]  You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?
[40:43.480 --> 40:48.000]  And that's exactly what is exactly what is where he's going.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.320]  The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia.
[40:50.320 --> 40:52.040]  I want to stay on the issue of race.
[40:52.040 --> 40:53.040]  You have to be kidding.
[40:53.040 --> 40:55.320]  Here we go again with Russia.
[40:55.320 --> 40:58.960]  And then Hunter got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife and
[40:58.960 --> 41:00.720]  so much more.
[41:00.720 --> 41:03.240]  Here is Fox doing a great job one time to play the full clip.
[41:03.240 --> 41:05.480]  We'll add it in post later when we archive this.
[41:05.480 --> 41:08.600]  This is Harris Faulkner knocking out of the park.
[41:08.600 --> 41:10.280]  I have a different question.
[41:10.280 --> 41:13.280]  How thick are the thieves of truth?
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.720]  Because I remember another media outlet and let's go ahead and throw them in as a media
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.080]  outlet and not some just outlier social platform Twitter.
[41:22.080 --> 41:25.300]  Because remember they want to put their thumb on the scale about what is factual and what
[41:25.300 --> 41:32.520]  is information and what is disinformation and what is qualification, all of that.
[41:32.520 --> 41:35.000]  So I guess they think they're journalists.
[41:35.000 --> 41:40.200]  So let's just do the mind experiment for just a second and pretend like they're journalists.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.320]  So how thick are the thieves of truth?
[41:42.320 --> 41:49.200]  Because if you even tweeted, retweeted, talked about tweeting, the New York Post's true and
[41:49.200 --> 41:55.400]  real story about Hunter Biden, his ties with energy, right?
[41:55.400 --> 41:59.880]  Oil companies and the millions, potentially billions of dollars that were wrapped up in
[41:59.880 --> 42:05.480]  deals with him sitting on energy boards with no prior work experience to do so.
[42:05.480 --> 42:09.120]  And an admission on 60 Minutes, he said, I use my dad's name.
[42:09.120 --> 42:10.120]  So we know the time.
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.600]  So we know that they were always compromised in the corporate media with big tech and the
[42:14.600 --> 42:20.400]  whole system suppressed that news, kept it from the public, the FBI did nothing.
[42:20.400 --> 42:25.520]  The Justice Department did nothing when it's him having sex with his niece on video.
[42:25.520 --> 42:31.400]  And it's him raping women and underage Chinese girls and snorting cocaine off their rear
[42:31.400 --> 42:33.960]  ends and everything else.
[42:33.960 --> 42:35.040]  And I refused to look at it.
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.880]  I talked to journalists that went through it, but I'm not even sure it's legal to even
[42:38.880 --> 42:39.880]  look at that stuff.
[42:39.880 --> 42:41.200]  So we never opened it.
[42:41.200 --> 42:43.460]  We just went to the sites that blurred it out and showed it.
[42:43.460 --> 42:44.920]  It's all confirmed.
[42:44.920 --> 42:45.920]  And it's unbelievable.
[42:45.920 --> 42:50.720]  Because I've never looked at child porn by, you know, even an investigation.
[42:50.720 --> 42:51.720]  I'm not looking at it.
[42:51.720 --> 42:53.920]  Thank God I've never seen it.
[42:53.920 --> 42:56.920]  I've never seen all this other stuff that goes on out there either.
[42:56.920 --> 42:59.680]  And I find myself very blessed and lucky because I know a lot of folks.
[42:59.680 --> 43:02.000]  Our world is so full of hype.
[43:02.000 --> 43:07.800]  We are force-fed dehumanizing propaganda by the corporate media, by the controlled churches
[43:07.800 --> 43:08.800]  and the universities.
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.800]  And why is this the case?
[43:13.800 --> 43:16.280]  Because we innately, by God, have been given the keys to our own minds, our own psyches,
[43:16.280 --> 43:17.280]  our own souls.
[43:17.280 --> 43:24.280]  And by connecting to God, we can empower ourselves and transcend the quote, fallen or sinful state.
[43:24.280 --> 43:30.000]  So the chemicals that we ingest and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.080]  change who we are are only lowering us.
[43:33.080 --> 43:34.080]  They're only making us more depressed.
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.080]  In the end, they're only making us less fulfilled.
[43:36.080 --> 43:41.880]  It is only by going within and really making that connection to God that we can truly empower
[43:41.880 --> 43:42.880]  ourselves.
[43:42.880 --> 43:47.560]  That's why the globe was bombarded with toxins and chemicals to block us getting the normal
[43:47.560 --> 43:52.880]  vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to be healthy and to be able to
[43:52.880 --> 43:55.080]  basically reach out beyond the third dimension.
[43:55.080 --> 43:59.080]  And that's where the incredible products come in at infostore.com.
[43:59.080 --> 44:09.080]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[44:09.080 --> 44:16.080]  prince that the general put is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[44:16.080 --> 44:21.880]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare, you're in a car and you get
[44:21.880 --> 44:29.880]  knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[44:29.880 --> 44:32.880]  You have a concussion and that's what the globalists have done.
[44:32.880 --> 44:33.880]  They have stunned us.
[44:33.880 --> 44:39.240]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[44:39.240 --> 44:40.240]  came out and gave him speech.
[44:40.240 --> 44:44.880]  He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture
[44:44.880 --> 44:49.880]  in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide
[44:49.880 --> 44:51.880]  humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[44:51.880 --> 44:53.880]  That's what the great reset is.
[44:53.880 --> 44:55.880]  They need darkness to thrive.
[44:55.880 --> 44:59.880]  The light lives at infowars.com.
[44:59.880 --> 45:08.880]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[45:08.880 --> 45:16.880]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are lost.
[45:16.880 --> 45:21.880]  That's what the globalists have done.
[45:21.880 --> 45:27.880]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then Klaus Schwab recently
[45:27.880 --> 45:28.880]  came out and gave him speech.
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.880]  He called the great new narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture
[45:33.880 --> 45:37.880]  in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone.
[45:37.880 --> 45:39.880]  That's what the globalists have done.
[45:39.880 --> 45:43.880]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[45:43.880 --> 45:48.880]  How the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone so they
[45:48.880 --> 45:51.880]  can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff.
[45:51.880 --> 45:52.880]  That's what the great reset is.
[45:52.880 --> 45:54.880]  They need darkness to thrive.
[45:54.880 --> 46:14.880]  The Light Lives at infowars.com.
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.880]  With a rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[46:54.880 --> 47:20.880]  That's infowarslife.com.
[47:24.880 --> 47:40.880]  So, thousands of videos, thousands of photos of him raping women, raping children, raping
[47:40.880 --> 47:48.880]  his family, taking trophy photos of his niece, smoking crack, his rotten teeth, who lays
[47:48.880 --> 47:54.880]  an evening on the laptop, and yeah, this is just some of it right here.
[47:54.880 --> 47:59.880]  Totally compromised by all these foreign governments that have no respect for us.
[47:59.880 --> 48:08.880]  And then we have Jen Psaki and all the rest of them absolutely, totally, and completely
[48:08.880 --> 48:15.880]  censoring all their opposition and using big tech to surveil everybody in live time.
[48:15.880 --> 48:16.880]  Look at this headline.
[48:16.880 --> 48:19.880]  America has a free speech problem.
[48:19.880 --> 48:25.880]  New York Times came out with this two days ago and calls for silencing people like Alex
[48:25.880 --> 48:26.880]  Jones.
[48:26.880 --> 48:30.880]  That's the press for you in this country today.
[48:30.880 --> 48:42.880]  While the queens of this corruption, like this individual, Jen Psaki, run around and
[48:42.880 --> 48:47.880]  do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, and just keep force feeding
[48:47.880 --> 48:52.880]  us lies and then censoring when we try to stand up and point out they're lying.
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.880]  Don't expect Twitter to provide restitution for censoring kicking Americans off the platform
[48:57.880 --> 49:04.880]  for showing totally legit Hunter Biden laptop stories, including the New York Post, because
[49:04.880 --> 49:07.880]  Congress doesn't act against this level of criminal activity.
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.880]  Senator Vowell's inquiry, the Hunter Biden's laptop.
[49:12.880 --> 49:13.880]  Why do you need an inquiry?
[49:13.880 --> 49:15.880]  You know what happened.
[49:15.880 --> 49:17.880]  It's all part of a larger program.
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.880]  I want to show a short clip from just a few months ago.
[49:22.880 --> 49:30.880]  Myself and Rob Dew sat through days of the last big Davos conference and Klaus Schwab,
[49:30.880 --> 49:33.880]  who's the Bilderberg group head and the head spokesman for the globalist.
[49:33.880 --> 49:34.880]  He's their PR man.
[49:34.880 --> 49:35.880]  He's their hype man.
[49:35.880 --> 49:37.880]  He's up there.
[49:37.880 --> 49:39.880]  He doesn't run it, but he's their hype man.
[49:39.880 --> 49:40.880]  You'll own nothing.
[49:40.880 --> 49:41.880]  You'll have nothing.
[49:41.880 --> 49:45.880]  And he talked about how we're going to set the narrative in the world and we're going
[49:45.880 --> 49:48.880]  to execute that narrative on you and we're going to control the future.
[49:48.880 --> 49:53.880]  That's why they want us alone and dumbed down and censored so they can rain down fraud on
[49:53.880 --> 49:56.880]  us and rain down lies on us and rain down.
[49:56.880 --> 49:57.880]  You'll own nothing.
[49:57.880 --> 49:58.880]  You'll have nothing.
[49:58.880 --> 49:59.880]  You'll eat bugs.
[49:59.880 --> 50:00.880]  And now they're rolling out.
[50:00.880 --> 50:03.880]  I'll show you in a moment how all we're going to have is bugs under the energy being cut
[50:03.880 --> 50:04.880]  off.
[50:04.880 --> 50:09.880]  They cut off our energy and shot off the Russian energy and shot off everybody else's energy.
[50:09.880 --> 50:13.880]  Now, let me show you a cartoon for TV viewers before I go to this clip.
[50:13.880 --> 50:16.880]  It's on the front page of infowars.com.
[50:16.880 --> 50:18.880]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[50:18.880 --> 50:27.880]  It's, again, making fun of a cartoon or making fun of Thanos and the end game series, I guess,
[50:27.880 --> 50:30.880]  where they all have the different rings and together they combine their powers.
[50:30.880 --> 50:33.880]  I guess Lord of the Rings is another analogy.
[50:33.880 --> 50:35.880]  Captain Planet.
[50:35.880 --> 50:41.880]  And it's with our powers combined, you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[50:41.880 --> 50:45.880]  And it's got Trudeau, the dictator of Canada, saying, I'll shut down your bank account.
[50:45.880 --> 50:48.880]  Hell, I'll put you in jail for 10 years without a trial.
[50:48.880 --> 50:51.880]  I'll shut down your social life.
[50:51.880 --> 50:54.880]  I'll shut down your electric car.
[50:54.880 --> 50:56.880]  I'll shut down your farmlands.
[50:56.880 --> 51:02.880]  And, of course, it's got Zuckerberg, I'll shut down your media, your social media.
[51:02.880 --> 51:07.880]  And all together Bill Gates, I'll shut down your farmlands.
[51:07.880 --> 51:09.880]  Biden, I'll destroy your borders, all the rest of it.
[51:09.880 --> 51:12.880]  Well, with our powers combined, you know what happens.
[51:12.880 --> 51:18.880]  Well, here's the James Bond villain in real life laying this out, how they're charting the future
[51:18.880 --> 51:21.880]  and they don't want any narrative that can challenge that.
[51:21.880 --> 51:26.880]  They've got a neoliberal, sexualizer children, pedophilia, open borders, world government,
[51:26.880 --> 51:34.880]  deep debt, be lazy, smoke weaponized marijuana all day long while they're positioning you
[51:34.880 --> 51:37.880]  for the collapse of civilization in their own words.
[51:37.880 --> 51:40.880]  Here's what Dr. Ebel had to say.
[51:40.880 --> 51:52.880]  What pleasure to be together again and to design the future.
[51:52.880 --> 51:59.880]  We are here to develop the great narrative, a story for the future.
[51:59.880 --> 52:07.880]  In order to shape the future, you have first to imagine the future, you have to design the future,
[52:07.880 --> 52:10.880]  and then you have to execute.
[52:10.880 --> 52:21.880]  Here, I think, the next two days, we will look how we imagine, how we design,
[52:21.880 --> 52:32.880]  how we execute the great narratives, how we define the story of our world for the future.
[52:32.880 --> 52:35.880]  So there's the great reset, the great collapse, the build back better,
[52:35.880 --> 52:40.880]  and the great narrative of the brainwashing as they create the crisis, they offer the solution.
[52:40.880 --> 52:43.880]  Let's go over a few of the headlines here today.
[52:43.880 --> 52:49.880]  Brits told to work from home three days a week in van cars on Sundays to beat Putin's energy crisis,
[52:49.880 --> 52:52.880]  even though they've already engineered the crisis, the value of the currencies.
[52:52.880 --> 52:56.880]  Now it's all Putin's fault, but don't worry, now they're going to have climate energy lock-downs,
[52:56.880 --> 53:01.880]  which they told you they'd do a few years ago, I told you they would do, and now here they're doing it.
[53:01.880 --> 53:07.880]  Elites suggest, they don't suggest that UN calls for it, price controls dystopian travel restrictions
[53:07.880 --> 53:12.880]  to manage soaring energy costs, which again will then destroy the infrastructure
[53:12.880 --> 53:15.880]  to even bring it out and drive up prices even higher later.
[53:15.880 --> 53:20.880]  For the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied the world with one out of every ten barrels of crude.
[53:20.880 --> 53:26.880]  Now it's not supplying those, and the International Energy Agency of the UN
[53:26.880 --> 53:31.880]  and a consortium of private banks is telling you they're about to cut your energy off even faster.
[53:31.880 --> 53:37.880]  Globalist agency calls for energy lock-downs including banning cars on Sundays to achieve climate goals,
[53:37.880 --> 53:43.880]  so what extinction rebellion can't get done blocking highways, their big brother will.
[53:43.880 --> 53:47.880]  I can't figure this out yet, I told you the last two years, thousands of times,
[53:47.880 --> 53:52.880]  they're going to cut the energy off, start cutting the power off, I've perseverated over and over again.
[53:52.880 --> 53:58.880]  Eat lentils instead of meat, Bloomberg News tells peasants earning less than 300,000 a year
[53:58.880 --> 54:02.880]  how to deal with inflation, stop eating meat, eat bugs, wow!
[54:02.880 --> 54:04.880]  They all got you ready for it, didn't they?
[54:04.880 --> 54:09.880]  Tucker Carlson, Americans becoming much poorer due to Washington's driven inflation,
[54:09.880 --> 54:15.880]  but it's okay, Mark Ruffalo, Leonardo DiCaprio, he's a big Davos guy,
[54:15.880 --> 54:21.880]  and Ben Stiller and more stars sign letter protesting Canada's gas pipeline.
[54:21.880 --> 54:25.880]  They've already shut down the keystone coming into the U.S. that would cut prices by 30% at least.
[54:25.880 --> 54:30.880]  Now they want existing pipelines over 50 years old all shut down
[54:30.880 --> 54:34.880]  and they're going against the Bank of Canada for runs on banks till more energy shut down
[54:34.880 --> 54:38.880]  because they're liberal, they care about you.
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.880]  Continuing, New York Post has got its own brand of corruption.
[54:42.880 --> 54:46.880]  I've talked to a lot of experts including nutritionists this week, this is pure bull,
[54:46.880 --> 54:50.880]  there's no truth to this, it's actually the opposite, you're less fertile if you don't eat meat.
[54:50.880 --> 54:52.880]  But they're saying if you eat meat, you can't have children.
[54:52.880 --> 54:56.880]  Oh, young people are having heart attacks and strokes after the COVID shot,
[54:56.880 --> 54:58.880]  they claim because they're depressed.
[54:58.880 --> 55:03.880]  And oh, meat's causing you to be infertile, the sperm 96% sterile now in the West.
[55:03.880 --> 55:06.880]  Oh, it's that meat they don't want you to eat.
[55:06.880 --> 55:11.880]  Now I see, yes, it makes you become infertile.
[55:11.880 --> 55:15.880]  Yes, because veganism was obviously a common trend years ago,
[55:15.880 --> 55:20.880]  that's what everybody had on average, six, seven kids 50 years ago, now it's less than two.
[55:20.880 --> 55:21.880]  Yes, it's all that meat.
[55:21.880 --> 55:27.880]  You know, they ate more meat 60, 70 years ago than we eat on average now.
[55:27.880 --> 55:34.880]  Unbelievable levels of BS, my friends.
[55:34.880 --> 55:38.880]  I'm not funded by George Soros, I'm not funded by the New World Order,
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.880]  I'm funded by you and nobody else has built an independent media outlet
[55:44.880 --> 55:49.880]  with tens of millions of views at Band-Aid video now every day or so
[55:49.880 --> 55:56.880]  with millions of millions of people tuned in right here every single day, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:56.880 --> 56:01.880]  So I just want to encourage everybody out there
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.880]  to understand that you built InfoWars
[56:05.880 --> 56:09.880]  and we had to have our own satellites and our own bandwidth and our own servers
[56:09.880 --> 56:14.880]  and we're serving millions and millions and millions and millions of videos a day
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.880]  and tens of millions of web serve pages a day
[56:18.880 --> 56:22.880]  and we're not the big global corporations with unlimited money.
[56:22.880 --> 56:26.880]  We are backed by you and the work we're doing is now more important than it's ever been.
[56:26.880 --> 56:30.880]  So I want to encourage everybody to go to infowarstore.com.
[56:30.880 --> 56:34.880]  We are running the biggest sale in our history right now
[56:34.880 --> 56:39.880]  because it turns out we have hundreds of items, a lot of it's t-shirts and things like that
[56:39.880 --> 56:43.880]  that are great shirts but that I never promoted and I never pushed
[56:43.880 --> 56:47.880]  more than 20 designs of t-shirts that are limited edition and really cool
[56:47.880 --> 56:51.880]  and that we need to sell to get funds in here to keep operating.
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.880]  We got a bunch of supplements, we got a bunch of survival gear, we got a lot of great stuff
[56:56.880 --> 57:01.880]  up to 75% off. That means we're losing money
[57:01.880 --> 57:05.880]  on things like the Save the Frogs flags
[57:05.880 --> 57:09.880]  or some of the Save the Frogs t-shirts that are already popular but I haven't promoted in a while so we got to move them out.
[57:09.880 --> 57:13.880]  And Fizzy Magnesium sold out for 8 plus months, it's back in stock.
[57:13.880 --> 57:16.880]  25% off, so good for your body, so delicious.
[57:16.880 --> 57:19.880]  Vitamin D gummies back in stock, 25% off.
[57:19.880 --> 57:23.880]  We have vasobites, amazing for your cardiovascular, your lungs, your heart, everything.
[57:23.880 --> 57:26.880]  Creates nitrous oxide in the blood, it's 40% off.
[57:26.880 --> 57:30.880]  And we also have a lot of other great products like Biotrystallinium, 40% off.
[57:30.880 --> 57:37.880]  But the big 75% off sale, a big Save the Frogs InfoWars.com shirt, 9.95.
[57:37.880 --> 57:41.880]  A flag, 9.95, these are big flags, these are nice.
[57:41.880 --> 57:54.880]  Please take advantage of this and keep us on air. We'll be right back with hour number two.
[58:11.880 --> 58:15.880]  I'm Phil Lomzash, as their transhumanist nightmare vision.
[58:15.880 --> 58:22.880]  Suppressing the voices of good people all around the world, and of doctors and scientists and engineers
[58:22.880 --> 58:31.880]  that are exposing all their lies, their COVID hysteria, their world's gonna end in 2030, carbon tax, global warming bull, all of it.
[58:31.880 --> 58:38.880]  And none of it can succeed, none of it can actually be carried out unless everybody is silenced and gas lit.
[58:38.880 --> 58:43.320]  That's why truth comes with hard work and with research and with diligence and that's
[58:43.320 --> 58:47.200]  why it's hard to share InfoWars links and band up video links.
[58:47.200 --> 58:50.120]  That's why we've got to share them now more than ever.
[58:50.120 --> 58:55.520]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[58:55.520 --> 58:57.560]  a healthier life.
[58:57.560 --> 59:01.400]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement
[59:01.400 --> 59:03.040]  that contains both.
[59:03.040 --> 59:08.000]  This InfoWars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.600]  from the InfoWars store.
[59:09.600 --> 59:14.400]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that
[59:14.400 --> 59:16.680]  contain the rose plant seeds.
[59:16.680 --> 59:21.960]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[59:21.960 --> 59:26.680]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[59:26.680 --> 59:27.680]  shown.
[59:27.680 --> 59:31.920]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important
[59:31.920 --> 59:36.520]  role in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[59:36.520 --> 59:41.640]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate even in affluent populations
[59:41.640 --> 59:42.640]  like here in America.
[59:42.640 --> 59:47.440]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com where we promise
[59:47.440 --> 59:50.800]  our rose hips don't lie.
[59:50.800 --> 1:00:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:10.560]  The first nation to successfully weaponize and mass produce deadly pathogens was Great
[1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:17.320]  Britain during the start of World War II, soon followed by the United States, Germany,
[1:00:17.320 --> 1:00:19.640]  France and Japan.
[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:26.520]  While many nations mass produced them, Japan was notorious for deploying biological weapons,
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:32.760]  killing almost a half a million Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:40.560]  including 1940 bombing of Ningbo China when Japan's secret bio-weapon 731 dropped ceramic
[1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:45.440]  bombs full of livingies carrying the bubonic plague.
[1:00:45.440 --> 1:00:51.360]  German pharmaceutical company IG Farben Bayer conducted fatal human experiments on prisoners
[1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:57.720]  and killed over a million people with its cyanide-based Zyclon B.
[1:00:57.720 --> 1:01:04.520]  The U.S. established their own bio-weapons program at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:10.240]  and by the end of the war, brand new facilities were completed for mass production of anthrax
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:12.440]  and other bio-weapons.
[1:01:12.440 --> 1:01:17.320]  After the war, the directors of IG Farben were punished at the Nuremberg trials, but
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:23.720]  the scientists were secretly absorbed into America's bio-weapons program.
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:29.360]  Japan was planning to attack the city of San Diego, California with weaponized plague,
[1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:33.240]  but they surrendered three weeks prior to the scheduled attack.
[1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:39.400]  And while Japanese researchers arrested by Soviet forces were tried for war crimes, those
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:44.960]  captured by the United States were secretly given immunity in exchange for working with
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:48.320]  the U.S. bio-weapons team.
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:54.840]  Long after World War II, the U.S. bio-weapons program continued to expand with the help
[1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:58.040]  of Japanese and German war criminals.
[1:01:58.040 --> 1:02:04.440]  And in 1969, the U.S. government officially terminated their offensive biological weapons
[1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:11.040]  program, continuing on with a defensive biological weapons program, which was nothing more than
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:17.040]  a change of language ahead of the biological weapons convention in 1972.
[1:02:17.040 --> 1:02:22.780]  The U.S. would continue to experiment with and produce deadly pathogens, but now under
[1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:29.000]  the guise of defense, and mostly defense against Russia.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:35.080]  Of all the nations involved in bio-weapons research, Russia factors in very little.
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:39.920]  The U.S. government claims that the Soviet Union had the biggest bio-weapons program
[1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:46.640]  in history, but this is based solely on a mysterious 1979 anthrax leak and the lone
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:52.400]  testimony of Soviet defector Ken Alebeck, who has also been absorbed into the U.S.
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:58.400]  bio-weapons program, and who has helped the U.S. surround Russia with dangerous bio-weapons
[1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:00.640]  labs.
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:05.040]  Russia is now releasing confiscated documents of the work that was being conducted in the
[1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:09.000]  NATO-backed bio-labs they have secured in Ukraine.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:15.200]  These labs were allegedly developing genetically engineered bio-weapons to target specific
[1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:22.320]  Slavic people, and experimenting with ways of spreading pathogens via bats, ticks, lice,
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:28.800]  and fleas, like the work Japan's Unit 731 was doing before being secretly brought into
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:30.120]  the U.S.
[1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:35.960]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is currently allowed to release hundreds of millions of genetically
[1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:43.360]  modified mosquitoes within the United States as some sort of disease control experiment.
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:48.040]  You can say what you want about Vladimir Putin and Russia, but they aren't the ones waging
[1:03:48.040 --> 1:03:50.920]  war against the people of the West.
[1:03:50.920 --> 1:03:56.400]  That would be the World Economic Forum, the big banks, and their lackeys of the Great Reset
[1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:58.160]  Agenda.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:04.080]  After the U.S. government sanctioned all the Russian people, Putin responded by only targeting
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:10.520]  a few known criminals of the Great Reset Cabal, as if sending a message to the Americans that
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:13.400]  we share the same enemies.
[1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:20.440]  Whereas the global elites are working towards destroying the nation-states, Russia is reinventing
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.400]  the nation-state.
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:28.720]  Russia hopes to be the world's biggest producer of organic farming, while the globalists are
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:34.680]  pushing for genetically modified foods, bugs, and synthetic meat.
[1:04:34.680 --> 1:04:40.280]  The globalists are actively destroying the family down to the mother's womb.
[1:04:40.280 --> 1:04:46.280]  While Russia seeks to build a society based on family and Christian values, the Russian
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:52.080]  government provides fallout shelters for the civilian population to potentially survive
[1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:57.480]  a nuclear war, and the U.S. government has absolutely nothing.
[1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.400]  This is a great sponsor.
[1:05:01.400 --> 1:05:05.600]  We have one of the best deals you're going to find out there on a high-quality, high-rated

[1:05:48.800 --> 1:06:02.320]  Infowarsphone.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020 and ask the Alex Jones Special.
[1:06:02.320 --> 1:06:13.440]  One answer to 1984 is 1776, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex
[1:06:13.440 --> 1:06:14.440]  Jones.
[1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:20.880]  Well, he's been having a lot of big viral videos the last two years, going up and really
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:25.240]  telling jokes in front of city councils, the Dallas, Fort Worth area, but also doing some
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.240]  of his rapping.
[1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.440]  And one of them got tens of millions of views this week dealing with the whole situation
[1:06:30.440 --> 1:06:35.720]  with Ukraine and Russia, and of course he is a Pimp, he owns a blimp, Alex Stein, comedian,
[1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:38.560]  really funny guys here with us for the balance of the hour, they're going to get back to
[1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:43.560]  being serious in the third and fourth hour tonight with some big breaking news and more.
[1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:48.800]  But first, here's one of the previous viral clips where he's in scrubs, not in a business
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:57.320]  suit, talking about the fraud of the whole COVID police state, which is now all confirmed.

[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:20.520]  So great satire, that got millions and millions of views as well, people can say it's over
[1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:24.600]  the top cringe, I think that's the point, Alex Stein is here, he's on YouTube with
[1:09:24.600 --> 1:09:29.320]  conspiracycastle, also he has a band.video channel, conspiracycastle, it's very very popular,
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:32.600]  he goes out into serious interviews, he's on the screen, he's attacked by liberals
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:33.720]  and more.
[1:09:33.720 --> 1:09:37.120]  We had John Friday, I appreciate you coming down here from Dallas, appreciate the crew
[1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:39.480]  getting, doing a great job getting here, thank you so much.
[1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:43.240]  Come on Alex, this is an honor, for me this is like the Super Bowl, I know you do this
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:47.200]  every single day, this guy does it six days a week, he's the hardest working man in show
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:50.000]  business and I know he doesn't call it show business cause he's a truth teller but at
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.240]  the end of the day, Alex, you are the number one comedian out there, so you, I mean.
[1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:56.560]  Well we gotta have some fun sometime but seriously tell us about yourself cause people wanna know
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:01.360]  about you, I mean this obviously this last video, 10 million views on Twitter, tens of
[1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:05.880]  millions everywhere else, people really really like the last one, I wanted to play the one
[1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:07.880]  before last for folks that haven't seen it.
[1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:12.480]  Well Alex, everybody knows what's going on right now is problem reaction solution, these
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:16.800]  these companies wanted to sell us a unlimited vaccine schedule, if you think the fourth
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:19.520]  booster is gonna stop, we're gonna be on the fifth booster, so what people don't realize
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:23.680]  is they manufactured a virus, now I'm not saying the virus isn't real but they overblown
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.480]  it, even in the media they're talking about right now, that they gave misinformation
[1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:30.760]  on the amount of children, they had a coding error, so they said there's more children
[1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:34.560]  that died from it than they actually, yeah they're covering their ass now, exactly, so
[1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:38.600]  what's going on guys, is they're lying to us and Bill Casey, the head of the ex-head
[1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:43.960]  of the CIA said it best, he said, our disinformation campaign will be complete when everything the
[1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:47.240]  public believes is a lie and that's what's happening right now, we do not know what
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:50.360]  is up, we do not know what is down, we do not know what is left, we do not know what
[1:10:50.360 --> 1:10:55.120]  is right, and that's a purpose deconstruction of our civility and that's what they're doing,
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:58.600]  they want to cause us to fight each other so we don't actually go and fight the people
[1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:00.320]  that are causing all the problems Alex.
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:05.080]  Now it seems to have worked on some people, so they're just getting dumber and dumber
[1:11:05.080 --> 1:11:08.560]  deeper into the lie, but a lot of people it seems to have backfired on.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:11.440]  Well see Alex, let me tell you something, when I first got into it, you inspired me,
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:14.040]  I'm not gonna sit here with my knee pads and kiss your butt all day, but what I'm saying
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:18.120]  is I promise not to do that if you came on, boring, you're a funny guy, everybody knows
[1:11:18.120 --> 1:11:19.120]  about Alsham.
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:22.520]  Let's be funny, let's be funny, what I'm trying to say is, listen, they've been lying to us
[1:11:22.520 --> 1:11:25.520]  and people are now realizing this, but when you come and you tell people information,
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:29.320]  you tell them young people are getting myocarditis at a level that they've never seen in the world,
[1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.840]  people aren't gonna get that, so what you have to do is, you have to use satire, you
[1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:35.680]  have to do cringe stuff in order to make people question the reality that we live in, because
[1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:38.400]  people don't want to ask questions, because everybody's a sheep, everybody's a sheep.
[1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:41.560]  You're shaking them out of their doldrums.
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.080]  Of course, and all I'm doing is put a mirror to the mainstream media, because the mainstream
[1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:49.960]  media is bull crap, I mean, we know that everything they tell us is a lie, and that's not some
[1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:54.040]  sort of hyperbole, that's not a cliche, that is the actual fact, and you look at any information
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.680]  you're talking about earlier, we knew Hunter Biden's laptop, we knew all the evidence on
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.720]  that laptop, yet when the New York Post tweeted it, if you retweeted it, they canceled your
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:06.680]  account, I got a strike for just sharing it on my YouTube, the actual story about it,
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:10.760]  so the technocracy, by the way, it gets worse, it gets worse, I've got articles in the Stack
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:15.440]  Today we'll show coming up, where mainstream news articles, when they have the CDC admitting
[1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.840]  they overestimated the number of people that got sick or died, those are being censored
[1:12:19.840 --> 1:12:24.120]  and blocked, I mean, it's like, Big Pharma is even in control of mainstream media when
[1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:27.520]  they try to finally tell the truth, or government officials, this is insane.
[1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:30.840]  No, Alex, this is the most insane part, and I don't want to get too low vibrational, but
[1:12:30.840 --> 1:12:34.960]  my mom got diagnosed with COVID, went to the hospital, went to the ICU, was given rem
[1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:38.680]  desivir without our, we told them, do not get, oh my God, that kills people.
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:43.480]  My mom died, my mom died October 25th, she was murdered at Baylor Hospital, the same
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:46.600]  hospital that fired Peter McCullough, and I got him on camera saying, do not get my
[1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:50.120]  mom rem desivir, they gave my mom rem desivir, and she died six days later.
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:51.120]  So guys, this is the problem.
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.080]  Brother, I didn't know that, well, tell us about your mom.
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  Yeah, well, my mom was the most important person in my life.
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:56.280]  Take your time on this, this is a big deal, start over.
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:00.120]  Well, I just want to say, my mom was my closest friend, she was my biggest fan, loved my content,
[1:13:00.120 --> 1:13:03.920]  more than anything, and they murdered my mom, because they know the protocols in the hospital
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:04.920]  is killing people.
[1:13:04.920 --> 1:13:05.920]  Why?
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:07.800]  Because they do have to inflate the numbers, because not enough people are dying from
[1:13:07.800 --> 1:13:08.960]  the actual virus.
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:11.680]  So if you guys think that Big Pharma has your back, they don't.
[1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:14.000]  As a matter of fact, they just want to use you like cattle.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.360]  They murdered my mom, the same hospital, Baylor Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that Peter McCullough
[1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:22.640]  got fired for saying this is not the proper protocol to treat this virus, yet they never
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.320]  gave my mom a chance to live.
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:28.560]  They murdered her, they tied her to a bed, they put a CPAP machine, basically, a BIPAP
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:32.840]  machine, excuse me, duct taped to her face, basically, and they murdered my mother.
[1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:37.280]  And so this, I'm out for blood, so listen, I can talk about comedy all day, I can laugh,
[1:13:37.280 --> 1:13:39.160]  because I have to laugh or else I'm going to cry.
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:41.080]  Every morning I wake up and I cry about my mom.
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:45.080]  So the New World Order, the Globus, they murdered the most important person in my life.
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.880]  So now, this is the origin story for me, a guy, to go attack the New World Order, because
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:50.880]  I'm...
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:54.360]  Okay, I was missing a piece, because there seemed to be kind of an anger and desperation
[1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.880]  in the rap, even though it seems funny, some pain there.
[1:13:56.880 --> 1:13:59.640]  I followed your videos, but I did not see the memorial for your mother.
[1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:03.320]  The great crew will download that video, we're going to play that memorial you gave for her
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:09.560]  there at the City Council in Dallas, in Plano, because this is a big, big deal.
[1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:13.280]  And again, for those that don't know, it's 100% in fact that in a bunch of studies, the
[1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:18.240]  best rendezavir did was somebody with COVID was a 7% increase, and that turned out to
[1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:23.920]  be a fraud, but over a 36% chance it would cause total renal failure of the kidneys and
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:24.920]  other organs.
[1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:30.320]  So this Fauci, just like he used AZT to kill people that had HIV in the 80s and 90s, he
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:31.320]  did it again.
[1:14:31.320 --> 1:14:34.760]  Fauci literally ordered that, Fauci literally murdered your mother.
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:35.760]  Alex, it's worse than that.
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:39.040]  I said, no rendezavir, no rendezavir is what I said.
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:42.160]  They still gave my mom rendezavir, because the infectious disease specialist looked
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:44.960]  me in the face and said, I know more than you, I know better than you.
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:48.360]  And I said, but I asked you not to, well, guess what, I'm not the doctor, so they murdered
[1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:49.360]  my mother.
[1:14:49.360 --> 1:14:50.360]  Now, I just hate sitting here.
[1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:51.360]  How do they feel now?
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:52.360]  Have you talked to those scumbags?
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:57.200]  Oh my gosh, Alex, they escorted me out with the police, when my mother died, when I held
[1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:01.240]  her hand, I watched her turn gray, she died my arms, and they had a cop escort me out
[1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:05.120]  of Baylor hospital after my mother died, because they didn't know what I was going to do, because
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:06.120]  they knew how emotional I was.
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:12.640]  Well, that's it, they've turned these into, I mean, rendezavir and the, and the ventilators
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:13.960]  are the new guillotines.
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:15.560]  Alex, this is not a joke.
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:19.720]  I can joke all day, but the pain is the only reason that I try to joke around because it
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:20.720]  hurts so bad.
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:24.840]  So what I'm telling you guys is we are living in a world of lies when you got a guy like
[1:15:24.840 --> 1:15:27.760]  Alice that's being persecuted so much, it's because he's hitting on target.
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:28.760]  It's not accidental.
[1:15:28.760 --> 1:15:31.800]  The reason they have to take him out, because he's one of the only voices out there that
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:33.200]  is able to save Remdesivir.
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:36.240]  If I said this on my channel, my own YouTube channel, they give me a strike.
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:39.640]  Even a video of my mother, I can get a strike talking about how my mother was murdered.
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  So that's where we live.
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:43.880]  We live in a world where the technocracy can say, oh, you can kill Vladimir Putin.
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:44.880]  That's fine.
[1:15:44.880 --> 1:15:47.920]  But if you say that young people are getting myocarditis, if you say that this vaccine
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.760]  is not safe and effective, when almonds, even almonds are not safe and effective for
[1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:52.760]  everyone.
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:53.760]  Yeah, you think a bi-
[1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  Hi there, Mr. Stein.
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:16:09.840]  William, in California, people are asleep and programmed controlled.
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:10.840]  I agree.
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.240]  How do you make the sleeper awaken, William?
[1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:13.240]  Oh, hi, Alice.
[1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:14.240]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:16.240]  Can I plug, uh, Alice, real quick?
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:17.240]  Yeah, go ahead.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:22.760]  Hey, I'm in my 60s, uh, and I did the work of 25, 30-year-olds, and I worked them into
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:27.120]  the ground, and you wanted to know why, and I've tested this, and I've taken your B12,
[1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:30.040]  and let me tell you, when I don't take it, I pay a price.
[1:16:30.040 --> 1:16:31.040]  I really do.
[1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:34.120]  I take that B12, and I'm electric, man.
[1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:35.360]  I can run 10 miles.
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:40.200]  I did some pretty heavy work, uh, with the highway department, and my friends will attest
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:46.400]  to the fact that, yeah, for a guy in his 60s, you know, pushing 70, I mean, I'm not just
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:57.640]  blowing smoke here, the B12 saves my life.
[1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:05.080]  The globalist social engineers always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:08.280]  until the populations rebelled.
[1:17:08.280 --> 1:17:13.800]  They would then use that as a pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:19.360]  anybody that speaks out against their lives, but because of so many scientists and engineers
[1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:25.080]  and researchers and others coming public and whistleblowers, now their whole project is
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:32.200]  falling apart because the people are aware that it is a world government corporate takeover,
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:35.520]  and so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:39.920]  The problem is some globalist-controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:46.280]  Like Canada, with a doubt, declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[1:17:46.280 --> 1:17:50.520]  areas of the world are following suit, like Australia, so pray for these folks big time.
[1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:55.880]  It's a very serious situation, and stay tuned into infowars.com because truth is absolutely
[1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:56.880]  paramount.
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:02.960]  I need your help keeping infowars on the air and strong.
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:07.000]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:11.640]  I was born for this, you were born for this, and people are really waking up right now,
[1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:16.640]  but we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:18.360]  that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:23.040]  And now, with Band-Aught Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:28.960]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:18:28.960 --> 1:18:29.960]  of charge.
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:34.760]  And because it becomes so successful, it's a catch-22.
[1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:39.240]  Infowars and Band-Aught Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty
[1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.240]  movement worldwide.
[1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:45.920]  But the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:50.440]  of thousands of dollars a month, so the biggest sale in Infowars history is going right now,
[1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:55.160]  the mega emergency blowout sale, up to 75% off, getting incredible products and keeping
[1:18:55.160 --> 1:18:57.760]  infowars as strong as ever.
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:06.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[1:19:06.600 --> 1:19:11.520]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:17.440]  have broken down, and Infowars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for
[1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:22.360]  operations, and I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making
[1:19:22.360 --> 1:19:23.360]  their main move.
[1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.160]  Infowars, it's paradoxical, it's more popular than ever, it's reaching more people than ever
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:32.800]  despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure
[1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:37.040]  and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:43.680]  So listen, up to 75% off at infowarsstore.com on things like amazing Patriot t-shirts that
[1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:49.400]  help spread the word and fund the operation, on supplements, on books, on films, everything

[1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:58.720]  Thank you for your support.
[1:19:58.720 --> 1:20:11.760]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:17.680]  Well I've been watching Alex Stein stuff for a couple years, I've seen his comedy and
[1:20:17.680 --> 1:20:19.160]  things, it was where it was working.
[1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:23.200]  I didn't know his mother just died last October, he's with us here on the Alex Jones show,
[1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:26.600]  he's got a lot of these big viral videos where he goes and raps and says things in front
[1:20:26.600 --> 1:20:32.280]  of different city councils up in the Dallas area, but I didn't know that in October of
[1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:37.160]  last year, a year after they knew, don't give rendezvous to people, of course Fauci knew
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:42.720]  from trials, 36% of people you give it to die of kidney failure alone and then it just
[1:20:42.720 --> 1:20:43.720]  gets worse from there.
[1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:47.200]  If you give them morphine or opiates, it makes you stop breathing.
[1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:52.000]  It turned out they give me even stronger drugs in the UK and knew it was to get rid of quote
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  old people.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.640]  So Alex, I was telling you, let's get serious and cover serious news, you went right into
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:20:57.640]  that, wow.
[1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:00.680]  I wasn't aware of it, now that I noticed, I went and looked on Band-Aid video and saw
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:05.960]  a video of you at the city council doing a memorial for her, we'll get to that next segment.
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:10.840]  But start at the beginning, because I mean you know Dr. Peter McCullough, he worked there,
[1:21:10.840 --> 1:21:15.080]  he exposed it, I know he's helping you out with some lawsuit things, but for people that
[1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:18.440]  don't know describe what happened because this is a big deal.
[1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:22.480]  So what happened was, my mom was not feeling well for about two weeks honestly, but she
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.640]  wasn't feeling that bad, so I was getting her groceries, then it got to where her breathing
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:27.500]  was kind of strained.
[1:21:27.500 --> 1:21:31.560]  She calls 911, they come to her house the first night, they said, oh well she's stable
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:36.040]  by the time they got there, you don't need to go to the hospital because her doctor,
[1:21:36.040 --> 1:21:41.200]  she had a telemedicine meeting and her doctor gave her albuterol for the breathing, right?
[1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:45.320]  But then the second night my mom faints while she's on the couch, so she calls 911 before
[1:21:45.320 --> 1:21:48.480]  she can even call me, she goes straight to the hospital, I go to check on her in the
[1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:53.440]  morning, I dial 911 to see if they picked up my mom, they had, so then I go to the hospital,
[1:21:53.440 --> 1:21:58.920]  the first day they had my mom sign a DNR, we told them, no remdesivir, do not give my
[1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:01.320]  mom any remdesivir.
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.160]  They had your mom sign a do not resuscitate.
[1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:07.240]  The first time we got there, as a matter of fact they had the palliative care come to
[1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:11.320]  us the first day, why my mom is still breathing, why my mom is talking to me, and then-
[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:13.360]  They might as well just head swinging a grim reaper outfit.
[1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:16.960]  And see this is the thing, my mom had an accident, so my mom was on disability and they knew
[1:22:16.960 --> 1:22:21.280]  that, my mom was on Medicaid even though she was only 60 years old, and they knew that,
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:24.640]  they know the remdesivir is $1800 a shot and you look at Baylor Hospital, which is the
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:27.560]  worst hospital in the entire world, so they took advantage of that, they knew that my
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:31.760]  mom was an open checkbook for whatever they could prescribe, they gave her, they did not
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:35.160]  take proper care and so what happened was this is the same hospital that Peter McCullough
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:36.160]  was fired from.
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:40.000]  I'm working with Peter McCullough's attorney to file a medical malpractice lawsuit, but
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:44.840]  the problem is, now on the death certificate it says COVID, so now I'm fighting an uphill
[1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:48.320]  battle, it doesn't say that she died from the fluids filling up her lungs and her kidneys,
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:51.320]  it says she died of COVID, so I'm not going to have an easy court case, this isn't going
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:54.840]  to be some money payday, even though I have them on tape saying, I told you don't give
[1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:56.640]  my mom remdesivir, I got this on tape.
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:22:58.880]  And by the way, she gave you the power to direct that?
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:01.280]  Yes, 100% and yet they still gave it to her because-
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:03.840]  Well they get $53,000 for anybody they intubate.
[1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:04.840]  Yes.
[1:23:04.840 --> 1:23:05.840]  And there's a bounty.
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:09.600]  This is what we said, we walked there, we said no intubation, no matter what, no intubation.
[1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.720]  When we said that, we said no intubation, no matter what, they said, well here's a DNR,
[1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:16.840]  your mom's going to die, the palliative care came, all because they wanted to intubate
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:22.000]  her as soon as we got there, so as a matter of fact, they let my mom die slowly, it wasn't
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.520]  some sort of, I almost sort of felt better if my mom was intubated and didn't have to
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:28.520]  feel the pain that she went through, but I watched my mom struggle and take her last
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:31.080]  breath and I mean, I don't even want to cry, I don't want to get emotional.
[1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:32.080]  Did they give her steroids?
[1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:33.080]  Did they give her steroids?
[1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:36.640]  Or did they give her a cocktail of medicine, that is what killed her Alex, it was-
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:37.640]  The ivermectin.
[1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  No ivermectin.
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:39.640]  No, they didn't give her ivermectin.
[1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:41.320]  We asked for ivermectin and they looked at me like I was some juror.
[1:23:41.320 --> 1:23:44.840]  By the way, they admit Rindesivir caused this massive organ failure.
[1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:48.680]  Of course, and listen, this isn't an accident, like you said earlier, Dr. Fauci during the
[1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:52.680]  AIDS epidemic was giving people AZT, which is some back-ordered cancer drug that didn't
[1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:54.480]  help people, as a matter of fact, it killed people.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.360]  So listen, this isn't a conspiracy theory, I wear my tinfoil hat all the time, I love
[1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:02.000]  conspiracies, but I'm telling you, this is not a conspiracy, this is a fact, my mom
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.560]  died because of the globalists, because they have big pharma murdered my mom to pump up
[1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:12.600]  their numbers to make a vaccine that will never end, a schedule that will never, ever
[1:24:12.600 --> 1:24:13.600]  end.
[1:24:13.600 --> 1:24:18.080]  And I'm telling you right now, Alex, I'm not done fighting the globalists, like you are
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:22.240]  fighting globalists, they mess with the wrong guy, I'm just telling you that much, Alex.
[1:24:22.240 --> 1:24:26.000]  Well, they know good and well what they did, they planned the whole thing out, England
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:31.080]  a year and a half before ordered over a hundred times what they normally had of a drug even
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:35.440]  stronger than morphine that they use in assisted suicide that makes you stop breathing.
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:38.720]  And then they gave it to hundreds of thousands of people, they killed.
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:41.480]  Yes, and this is the thing, guys, you're like, oh, what is COVID?
[1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:46.360]  Well, we've had SARS, sudden acute respiratory syndrome, MERS, before March of 2020.
[1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:50.720]  So there have been viral diseases, but what happens is in normal year, about 60 to 100,000
[1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:52.240]  people die of those viruses.
[1:24:52.240 --> 1:24:55.280]  So that number is about the same this past year, but in order to...
[1:24:55.280 --> 1:24:58.280]  Well, in 2020 it was, now it exploded because of the vaccines after that.
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:25:01.760]  And guys, listen, you're going to talk about the vaccine, oh, I know somebody got the vaccines
[1:25:01.760 --> 1:25:05.360]  totally fine, but I also know children that got the vaccine have had heart attacks.
[1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:07.320]  The news is trying to cover up, like Alex said...
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:08.960]  Now they tell you heart attacks are normal in kids.
[1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:12.520]  Of course, yeah, they said, oh, kids are stressed, oh, that's why they're having heart attacks.
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:15.280]  It has nothing to do with the bio weapon that they're putting in your vein.
[1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:16.400]  And it's a never ending schedule.
[1:25:16.400 --> 1:25:19.320]  Just look at Israel, they're on their fourth booster, their numbers are going up and that's
[1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:20.320]  what they're going to do now.
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:21.320]  They're going to do a fourth booster.
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:22.320]  And you never, exactly.
[1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:24.680]  And then you wonder why the hospitals are full.
[1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:27.120]  Every country that takes the shots, the hospitalizations explode.
[1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:32.400]  Well, Alex, these hospitals are in the, they're a business, a capitalist business.
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:35.880]  This is not some sort of, oh, go lucky, we're trying to save your life.
[1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:38.600]  And the doctors that murdered my mom, I wouldn't have brought my cat to them.
[1:25:38.600 --> 1:25:41.280]  I have more respect for my veterinarian than I have for these doctors.
[1:25:41.280 --> 1:25:44.160]  They were right off the medical school boat, whatever you want to call it.
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:46.280]  And they were a clown, they were a joke.
[1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:49.840]  And that's why my mom had to die because in any ICU you're going to get some doctor that
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.560]  just graduated school that doesn't know his derriere from his elbow and he's going to sit
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:57.240]  there and just listen to whatever the, whatever the proper protocol is.
[1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:59.680]  But this protocol is what killed my mother.
[1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:04.480]  Which allows, again, murder through medicine, the Soviets did it, the Nazis did it.
[1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:09.440]  And they all know it's a lie, but they followed orders and this is the new woke medicine where
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:13.040]  they've now committed these massive crimes, they've committed murder.
[1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:16.840]  And don't worry, the system now has an army that'll do whatever they want when they release
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:22.440]  the next bio weapon, which Fauci says is imminent and he wants more lockdowns after the midterms.
[1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:25.400]  Alex, I want to say this, you just played a clip of the dancing nurses.
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:28.120]  When I was at the hospital, I was there for hours every single day.
[1:26:28.120 --> 1:26:31.360]  I'd go down and go get, you know, the Chick-fil-A or whatever.
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:34.160]  And I would see the nurses making tick-tock dances.
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:38.560]  While my mom is dying, I would see nurses joking around, having an old cow town around.
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:43.000]  That's because they kicked everybody else out so they could carry out their operation
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.240]  with no one looking and wouldn't let most areas family in to even see what they were
[1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:47.240]  doing.
[1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:49.520]  Well, luckily, you know, you're allowed to go every single day.
[1:26:49.520 --> 1:26:53.440]  I had to sign a COVID release like I cared, and they were so mad at me.
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:55.080]  They were actually mad that I was in there, Alex.
[1:26:55.080 --> 1:26:58.480]  I'm telling you, they looked at me, they're like, are you not afraid of getting COVID?
[1:26:58.480 --> 1:27:00.960]  We really don't recommend you being with your mom while she dies.
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:04.680]  I'm like, I would be with my mom if she had the most viral disease in the world because
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:08.360]  I would die for my mother, yet they look at me for wanting to be there with my mom like
[1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.360]  I was some jerk, like I was some psychopath.
[1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:15.000]  And again, it was really also the big hospitals and nursing homes to get $53,000 for every
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  person they killed.
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:20.400]  Well, and they got $39,000, I think, just for her being diagnosed with COVID.
[1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:24.960]  So listen, we are another $15,000 for putting the tube down the throat and guys, they are
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:25.960]  $10,000 when they kill them.
[1:27:25.960 --> 1:27:27.440]  So I guess it's $63,000.
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:28.440]  Sorry.
[1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:32.200]  No, they made more money than my mom had in the bank killing her.
[1:27:32.200 --> 1:27:35.200]  And I'm telling you, I would have paid that money a million times over to save her life,
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:38.320]  but that doesn't matter because those doctors are not interested in saving my mom's life.
[1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:40.800]  Those doctors are just interested in following orders.
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:41.800]  And that's the problem.
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:44.280]  And this is all a technocracy beta test, what they're getting ready to roll out even
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:45.280]  bigger.
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:48.720]  And guys, you know, any doctor, all these doctors do are follow orders.
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:50.760]  None of these doctors are actually making decisions on their own.
[1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:51.760]  As a matter of fact, when I went to...
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:52.760]  They might as well be robots.
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:55.960]  Well, when I went to CVS to go try to fill it up for Ivermectin, if they said that that
[1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:58.080]  was for coronavirus, they wouldn't even give it to me.
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:27:59.440]  They wouldn't even give me Ivermectin.
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:00.680]  So listen, they can control...
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:04.880]  The left is for assisted suicide and for cutting little boys' genitals off.
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:08.600]  But if you want to give them a pill that they admit is safe, but they claim doesn't work,
[1:28:08.600 --> 1:28:09.600]  you can't have it.
[1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:12.960]  Because they're tyrants, because they're control freaks, because they're murderers, because
[1:28:12.960 --> 1:28:17.560]  they're corporate front people posing as liberals who are actually a bunch of dangerous pedophiles.
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:19.280]  Alex, just look at Nigeria.
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:21.760]  Nigeria has the lowest numbers of COVID in the world.
[1:28:21.760 --> 1:28:25.120]  They prescribe Ivermectin like crazy because they have parasites in their water.
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:26.120]  India.
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:27.120]  Yeah, India.
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:28.120]  Listen!
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:29.120]  And those numbers of COVID are all the way down.
[1:28:29.120 --> 1:28:31.880]  So I'm not saying that Ivermectin is a cure-all, but it would help.
[1:28:31.880 --> 1:28:33.040]  These people are not trying to help.
[1:28:33.040 --> 1:28:34.040]  They're trying to...
[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:35.040]  And Alex, here's the deal, though.
[1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:38.560]  They're just pausing here because they knew we woke up and were about to hit the crest
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:39.640]  of awakening.
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:40.800]  They're bringing this all back.
[1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:41.800]  That's the plan.
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:44.520]  They've got to keep hammering these people and call for justice.
[1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:48.400]  Bill Gates, Peter Dazik, Fauci, they all need to go to prison.
[1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:49.880]  We have them red-handed.
[1:28:49.880 --> 1:28:50.880]  They've been caught.
[1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:51.880]  They cooked the weapon up.
[1:28:51.880 --> 1:28:52.880]  They released it.
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:54.240]  And then the injection is even worse.
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:56.240]  It's the same thing.
[1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:57.240]  Let me taste it.
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:01.520]  I am a worldly person, meaning I like going to ball games.
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:02.880]  I like going to concerts.
[1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:04.200]  I like going to play golf.
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:05.640]  I like going out to dinner.
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:07.640]  I like the metropolitan life.
[1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:10.120]  I like everything that comes with this.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:16.200]  You see, I have the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of Democrat-run cities,
[1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.040]  get the hell out of major metropolitan areas.
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:22.080]  Because unless we change course soon, it's all crashing down.
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:25.720]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:29.280]  the woods, just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the
[1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:30.280]  land?
[1:29:30.280 --> 1:29:31.280]  That's the survival instinct.
[1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:35.040]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says, no,
[1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:36.040]  no, no, no, no.
[1:29:36.040 --> 1:29:37.040]  Stay in the city.
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:40.520]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere, whatever notion that you need
[1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:42.200]  to get a vaccine or a mask.
[1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:47.720]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you and the audience are facing
[1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:48.720]  as well.
[1:29:48.720 --> 1:29:53.280]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:55.880]  And so we have the best ones at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:55.880 --> 1:30:03.040]  It has been noted by many a historian, the first casualty of war is the truth.
[1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:07.640]  And the next big casualty isn't even the people that died.
[1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:10.400]  No, that is very of these hollows.
[1:30:10.400 --> 1:30:18.720]  But first there is the crackdown on populations, basic liberty and speech and massive censorship.
[1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:24.320]  And now across the world from the United States to Europe, legislation is being introduced
[1:30:24.320 --> 1:30:32.840]  that if you amplify any quote pro-Russian information, you can be censored.
[1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:34.280]  You can be arrested.
[1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:35.280]  You can be at prison.
[1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:41.200]  And of course now Canada is under this legislation that if you have a thought crime and they
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:47.080]  think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online, that you will be censored
[1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:48.080]  and arrested.
[1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:52.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, the authoritarianism is being carried out by the globalists around
[1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:56.920]  the world against humanity that makes infowarstore.com more important than ever.
[1:30:56.920 --> 1:31:06.920]  If I had to describe with just one word, the brainwashing, the mind control, the asleep
[1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:13.680]  prince that the general public is in, the best word would actually be the people are
[1:31:13.680 --> 1:31:14.680]  lost.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:19.920]  Just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a bad nightmare or you're in a car or you
[1:31:19.920 --> 1:31:28.160]  are knocked out and you've lost your bearings because you are totally dizzy and confused.
[1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:29.160]  You have a concussion.
[1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:30.960]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[1:31:30.960 --> 1:31:31.960]  They have stunned us.
[1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:35.840]  They have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings.
[1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:39.120]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave him a speech he called The Great New
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:44.680]  Narrative where he brags how the public is lost, how the culture in the media has been
[1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:48.920]  driven to make sure the people are all alone so they can now guide humanity over the edge
[1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:49.920]  of a cliff.
[1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:51.720]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[1:31:51.720 --> 1:31:57.520]  They need darkness to thrive, the light lives at infowars.com.
[1:31:57.520 --> 1:32:01.640]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans.
[1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:07.240]  They financed major universities, they ran full page stories and advertisements pushing
[1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:11.800]  their propaganda of New York Times, other major newspapers, that the family as we know
[1:32:11.800 --> 1:32:17.200]  it is a bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of
[1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:22.540]  the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters
[1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:24.040]  and husbands is a bad thing.
[1:32:24.040 --> 1:32:28.920]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter, my four natural daughter.
[1:32:28.920 --> 1:32:29.920]  My wife makes dinner a lot of times.
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:30.920]  But I like to make it as well.
[1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:31.920]  I love to make breakfast.
[1:32:31.920 --> 1:32:37.920]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be nurturative
[1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:41.520]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event.
[1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:47.520]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding, is our normal biological actions
[1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:48.520]  are coming together.
[1:32:48.520 --> 1:32:54.000]  They really are a sick, evil, scientific cult of filth that will domesticate us and turn
[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  us into lab rats.
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.960]  We cannot let this continue.
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:11.960]  Using a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:11.960 --> 1:33:18.960]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:25.960]  I lost family and friends from the bio weapon that was created by Fauci and the globalist
[1:33:25.960 --> 1:33:27.960]  Bill Gates on record.
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:31.400]  And then they rolled their weapon out on purpose to remove Trump from office.
[1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:33.760]  He of course fell for their trick to roll out the vaccine.
[1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:37.240]  Who could imagine they were going to roll out the same thing that's in the virus, spike
[1:33:37.240 --> 1:33:38.640]  protein in a shot.
[1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:39.880]  But they did.
[1:33:39.880 --> 1:33:42.840]  And now we know the carnage and what's happened since then.
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:44.680]  I've got some big news on that front.
[1:33:44.680 --> 1:33:48.840]  I was already planning to get into it with Alex Stein here, who is already a well-known
[1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:53.600]  talk show host and comedian, but then I know that his mother had actually died last October
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:33:58.160]  despite the fact that he was informed and knew what was going on and had the power of attorney
[1:33:58.160 --> 1:34:00.640]  or power over life with that.
[1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:04.960]  They just over read and did what they wanted and I've talked to a lot of medical doctors.
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:08.760]  My dad's a physician retired and they just say this is the tyranny of the new corporate
[1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:13.920]  medicine where the bioethics boards with the big companies that own the hospitals, they
[1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:16.560]  make the decision.
[1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:18.720]  Alex Stein is here with us.
[1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:19.920]  We actually have a clip.
[1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:23.600]  You just hope folks, the whole name of the video, they want to find it on your YouTube
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  or at Band-Aid video.
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:25.600]  They can see the whole thing.
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:29.720]  But you actually have video of you telling them no remdesivir because this was a year
[1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:33.720]  after it had already killed a bunch of people around the world and was well known in a lot
[1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:36.160]  of hospitals where we're not giving it anymore.
[1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:37.160]  This is just crazy.
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:40.960]  But these guys took their directive, I guess, directly from Fauci.
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:41.960]  Damn them to hell.
[1:34:41.960 --> 1:34:42.960]  Tell us what happened.
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:46.640]  So in this clip, the first clip we're going to play, I talk about how I told the doctors
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:47.640]  no remdesivir.
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:51.120]  You're going to see the palliative care doctor and off-screen, you're going to see Dr. Snow.
[1:34:51.120 --> 1:34:53.240]  That's the one that okayed the medicine for my mother.
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:56.080]  So this clip, this is my mom dying right here.
[1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:59.600]  This is not, you know, I like to joke around, I like to laugh, but I'm telling you the only
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:01.320]  reason why is because I'm in so much pain.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:04.560]  It's the only thing that makes it, you know, even livable because my life is actually a
[1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:05.560]  living nightmare.
[1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:10.760]  So in this video, the last 20 seconds, I tell them no remdesivir and they just look at me
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:14.160]  like I'm some sort of conspiracy tinfoil hat idiot.
[1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:15.160]  And I'm telling you.
[1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:19.440]  Which on record, fills up the body with fluid because the kidneys fail.
[1:35:19.440 --> 1:35:24.200]  Oh, 100% in her health declined rapidly after they gave her the remdesivir.
[1:35:24.200 --> 1:35:27.200]  So if you have the clip, the last 20 seconds of it, yeah.
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:31.960]  Well, I just don't understand why I said I didn't want a remdesivir when you guys put
[1:35:31.960 --> 1:35:32.960]  on remdesivir.
[1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:36.440]  I was the infectious disease doctor and she had already been on that and completed the
[1:35:36.440 --> 1:35:37.440]  course.
[1:35:37.440 --> 1:35:40.320]  I'm talking about before the first day we're in here, I said we didn't want to do that.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:41.320]  And you guys did that anyway.
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:43.320]  So if you look at the studies right now.
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:46.320]  Listen, I don't care about the studies, I asked you not to do something and you did
[1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:47.320]  it.
[1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:48.320]  Okay.
[1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:49.320]  That's the problem.
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:50.320]  That's what they say to me.
[1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:51.320]  They said, oh, well, the study told us to do it.
[1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:53.360]  Guys, they murdered my mother.
[1:35:53.360 --> 1:35:54.920]  I don't care what you say.
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:55.920]  Anybody can look me in the face.
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:58.840]  I watch my mom get murdered and I told them do not give her.
[1:35:58.840 --> 1:35:59.840]  It's on record.
[1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.840]  She does.
[1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:01.840]  This is how he kills people.
[1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:02.840]  He does it through the medical system.
[1:36:02.840 --> 1:36:05.320]  He commits the same crime in different ways over and over again.
[1:36:05.320 --> 1:36:06.320]  It's classic.
[1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:07.320]  We have all the documents.
[1:36:07.320 --> 1:36:08.320]  Nuremberg too.
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:12.160]  They should all be charged and brought up on crimes against humanity charges.
[1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:15.920]  Now, now describe this city council, Dallas city council.
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:18.280]  This is not you doing a rap video.
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:22.120]  This is you right after she's died giving a memorial.
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  Tell us about this.
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:24.120]  We'll go to the clip.
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:27.280]  Well, this is just me, you know, talking about how my mom was murdered, trying to bring
[1:36:27.280 --> 1:36:28.280]  awareness to it.
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:30.800]  So this wasn't me being a goofball or clown like normal.
[1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:32.320]  So this is the problem though, Alex.
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:36.280]  I go up there and I spilled my heart and soul out there and they look at me like I'm some
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:37.280]  freak.
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:38.880]  That's the sad problem with these politicians.
[1:36:38.880 --> 1:36:42.320]  That's why I have to act goofy because these are what I call non playable characters.
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:44.880]  That's video game terminology that they're not going to interact with us.
[1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:47.240]  These politicians, once we elect them, they think they're better than them.
[1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:48.520]  Well, they're like these new doctors.
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:51.960]  It's all about not caring, not having the facts, not having empathy and carrying out
[1:36:51.960 --> 1:36:56.200]  their orders from Klaus Schwab that come down the directive, just like Trudeau, just like
[1:36:56.200 --> 1:36:57.200]  all of them.
[1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:01.880]  Let's go ahead and roll this tape.
[1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:02.880]  Dallas city council memorial.
[1:37:02.880 --> 1:37:03.880]  Hello.
[1:37:03.880 --> 1:37:09.240]  Usually I come here to joke around or say something, you know, to highlight the absurdity
[1:37:09.240 --> 1:37:11.560]  and hypocrisy of our elected officials.
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:17.240]  But today is not that day because my mom was murdered on October 25th at Baylor hospital.
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:21.240]  She was given remdesivir without our authority.
[1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:24.400]  We told them specifically not to give her remdesivir.
[1:37:24.400 --> 1:37:27.480]  Five days later, all of my mom's organs shut down.
[1:37:27.480 --> 1:37:28.920]  We showed them the studies.
[1:37:28.920 --> 1:37:32.640]  Over 30% of the people that were given remdesivir in the studies died.
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:36.880]  We told the doctor, the infectious disease specialist, do not give my mom remdesivir.
[1:37:36.880 --> 1:37:37.880]  Guess what they did?
[1:37:37.880 --> 1:37:40.480]  They gave her a five day cycle and my mom is dead.
[1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:41.480]  She's dead.
[1:37:41.480 --> 1:37:46.440]  She died at Baylor hospital, tied to a bed with a ventilator stuck to her, taped to
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:52.120]  her face with her hands tied to the bed because she was ripping it off.
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:58.600]  What they did to my mom by slowly torturing her to death will not happen to me because
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:00.160]  I'm not going to go out like that.
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:01.760]  First of all, nobody should go out like that.
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:05.200]  Every single person on this council should hope and pray that you do not receive the
[1:38:05.200 --> 1:38:09.680]  same care that my mom received at Baylor hospital when she was murdered.
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:13.920]  You guys better hope and pray that when you are in a circumstance, when you have needed
[1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:17.880]  life saving treatment and you tell the doctor to do something, you better go to a hospital
[1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:21.200]  where they will listen to you because at Baylor hospital, they wanted to ventilate my mom
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.680]  as soon as she got there while she was walking and talking in the hospital, they wanted to
[1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:29.440]  ventilate her because they get a $39,000 federal funding every time somebody is on
[1:38:29.440 --> 1:38:30.440]  a ventilator.
[1:38:30.440 --> 1:38:35.720]  I know my mom is dead given an experimental drug and so now I have to live with this pain
[1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:38.320]  every single day for the rest of my life.
[1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:40.880]  So I wrote a little poem to honor my mom.
[1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:42.840]  I miss my mother more than I ever thought.
[1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:45.320]  I've been to hell and boy, it's hot.
[1:38:45.320 --> 1:38:50.760]  Watching my mom die in front of my face, it was more painful than a bottle of mace.
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:55.080]  Sometimes you forget the world is so bad until you go to Baylor hospital and die before your
[1:38:55.080 --> 1:38:56.320]  son's dad.
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.200]  I will never recover from this pain.
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:02.280]  The memory of my mom dying is tattooed in my brain.
[1:39:02.280 --> 1:39:06.320]  I don't wish this hurt on any mortal soul.
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:09.960]  The feeling is empty like a shattered bowl.
[1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:12.880]  I lost my number one fan on the earth.
[1:39:12.880 --> 1:39:15.440]  Without my mother, I feel a little worth.
[1:39:15.440 --> 1:39:18.480]  Please don't let my mom die in worthless vein.
[1:39:18.480 --> 1:39:22.480]  Baylor hospital killed her with a side of extra pain.
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:26.160]  My story is not unique in the slightest.
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.400]  So hug your mom and dad while they're still the brightest.
[1:39:29.400 --> 1:39:33.800]  Because my mom is dead and my heart is broken, you can lose a loved one before you finish
[1:39:33.800 --> 1:39:35.320]  that sig that you're smoking.
[1:39:35.320 --> 1:39:40.320]  And I'm telling you guys, we told these doctors at Baylor hospital, do not give my mom room
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:41.320]  a desert.
[1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:46.000]  Five days later, tied to a bed, all of her organs failed and she died in my arm.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:47.880]  I watched my mom turn gray.
[1:39:47.880 --> 1:39:51.480]  And now that I've been to hell and back, my mom will not die in vain.
[1:39:51.480 --> 1:39:56.120]  And the people at Baylor hospital, they will know what they did was wrong because I will
[1:39:56.120 --> 1:40:02.040]  bring and highlight the travesty of the murder of Kelly Fahy Stein by the hands of Baylor
[1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:04.000]  hospital in Dallas, Texas.
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  So my mom will not die in vain.
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:09.880]  RIP mom, I miss you more than anything in this entire world and you shouldn't have had
[1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:12.080]  to die at 60 years old.
[1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:13.640]  Thank you.
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:14.640]  Thank you.
[1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:15.640]  Thomas Lambert.
[1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:16.640]  All right.
[1:40:16.640 --> 1:40:20.400]  Let me lay this out for people and obviously you comment about your mother.
[1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:24.040]  It's not like Alex Stein is just pissed off because his mom died.
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:25.600]  We know how they made the virus.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.560]  We have the emails, the documents, the funding, how they prepared to release it to blow up
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:38.040]  the old system and bring in mRNA gene therapy, gene editing takeover and studying the spike
[1:40:38.040 --> 1:40:43.160]  protein, studying how the vaccine would actually give you permanent infections of long COVID.
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:45.160]  They did it all.
[1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:47.600]  Then they rolled out the rendezvous of your that all the world killed people.
[1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:50.120]  So most places stopped it in a few months.
[1:40:50.120 --> 1:40:56.480]  New York by October last year when they killed your mother had to stop ventilating people
[1:40:56.480 --> 1:40:59.880]  when they were standing up because ventilating somebody with COVID kills them.
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:04.480]  So Baylor knew that's what's incredible and was doing stuff late last year when almost
[1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:09.640]  everybody else had quit like robots because that's what the hospital directives told them
[1:41:09.640 --> 1:41:14.640]  to get the maximum amount of money and let me tell you, you think you want to bring judgment
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:15.640]  on them?
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:17.640]  God will bring judgment on all these people.
[1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:20.320]  Whatever they did to you and your mother is going to be done to them sevenfold by God.
[1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:21.320]  You can guarantee it.
[1:41:21.320 --> 1:41:22.320]  Well, that's a fact.
[1:41:22.320 --> 1:41:23.320]  I mean, I'm going to tell you something.
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:24.520]  My mom will not die in vain.
[1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:29.120]  I will never stop fighting these evil people that did this to my mom because nobody else
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:31.120]  that I know or love is going to be murdered like that.
[1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:34.120]  Now I'm telling you, some stuff is out of my control even though I was at the hospital
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:36.280]  because they will look you in your face and lie to you.
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:39.440]  These same people that you're supposed to trust, these doctors will say, oh, we're not going
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:40.440]  to do that.
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:41.960]  And they do it behind your back and they say that they know better.
[1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.360]  So they'll tell you, they're not going to vaccinate your baby with some deadly shot
[1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:45.360]  and do it anyways.
[1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:46.360]  Well, and we know because they're criminals.
[1:41:46.360 --> 1:41:50.800]  I mean, if you look at the back schedule, they even say the MMR vaccine, if they didn't
[1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:53.160]  give it at a certain time, it wouldn't cause autism.
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:56.960]  Yet they still recommend to give it at such an early age where the numbers, they say,
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.360]  oh, correlation doesn't mean causation.
[1:41:59.360 --> 1:42:00.840]  That's how evil these people are.
[1:42:00.840 --> 1:42:04.320]  And it's the same people that will lie to you on the news so you cannot ever, ever know
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:05.480]  what the truth is.
[1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:08.480]  Because like I said at the beginning of this interview, Bill Casey, the head of the CIA
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:13.000]  said, the biggest disinformation campaign, you'll know that we're winning this campaign
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.080]  when everything everybody believes is a lie.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:16.240]  And that's what's going on now.
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:20.200]  And the doctors know this is bull crap, but they do it and they're following orders killing
[1:42:20.200 --> 1:42:21.720]  people on purpose, Alex.
[1:42:21.720 --> 1:42:24.640]  We started winning in the last few months around the world.
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:25.640]  Our numbers were exploding.
[1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:27.120]  They were losing more whistleblowers.
[1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:30.480]  So now they're acting like they're backing off their medical tyranny, hoping we fall
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:31.480]  asleep.
[1:42:31.480 --> 1:42:33.320]  Now, we know you're never going to go away until we get rid of you.
[1:42:33.320 --> 1:42:34.860]  We know you're going to keep coming back.
[1:42:34.860 --> 1:42:38.720]  So we're on you and we're not going to stop exposing the medical tyranny and we're going
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:40.920]  to bring Bill Gates and the globalists to justice.
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:41.920]  Yeah.
[1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:44.400]  And it can't happen fast enough, but that's what's happening now, guys.
[1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:45.600]  It's all wag the dog.
[1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:47.600]  We're trying to distract us because people are waking up.
[1:42:47.600 --> 1:42:48.600]  People are tired of the mass.
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:49.600]  People are not.
[1:42:49.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  Stay there.
[1:42:50.600 --> 1:42:53.800]  The other side of Alex Stein on the other side of ton of news, I'm hosting 34th hour
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:54.800]  as well.
[1:42:54.800 --> 1:42:55.800]  Huge.
[1:42:55.800 --> 1:42:58.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:02.360]  I need your help keeping info wars on the air and strong.
[1:43:02.360 --> 1:43:06.400]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:07.560]  I was born for this.
[1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:12.040]  You were born for this and people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:17.040]  own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions
[1:43:17.040 --> 1:43:18.040]  of dollars.
[1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:22.560]  And now with Bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for
[1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:28.360]  thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free
[1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:29.360]  of charge.
[1:43:29.360 --> 1:43:35.800]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Bandot video have
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:41.320]  become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide, but the expenses
[1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:45.840]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[1:43:45.840 --> 1:43:46.840]  of dollars a month.
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:51.000]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:56.480]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:01.360]  We here at info wars are proud to announce the first ever kava kava root supplement
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:05.120]  that is now available at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:05.120 --> 1:44:09.280]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:13.920]  it has been used for hundreds of years in the pacific islands for its relaxation and
[1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:15.400]  euphoric effects.
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:21.160]  According to ancient Samoan legend, kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa,
[1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:25.160]  who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:30.200]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to
[1:44:30.200 --> 1:44:31.440]  loosen up a little.
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:36.000]  Nowadays kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:42.280]  The new kava chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other
[1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:48.400]  herbs including but not limited to, German chamomile, organic skullcap, and balearion
[1:44:48.400 --> 1:44:49.400]  root.
[1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:56.880]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:04.320]  The globalist social insiders always intended to push their COVID biomedical tyranny lockdowns
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:07.520]  until the populations rebelled.
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:13.040]  They would then use that as the pretext for permanent martial law and banning and arresting
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.000]  anybody that speaks out against their lives.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:21.480]  But because of so many scientists and engineers and researchers and others coming public and
[1:45:21.480 --> 1:45:27.160]  whistleblowers, now their whole project is falling apart because the people are aware
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:31.440]  that it is a world government corporate takeover.
[1:45:31.440 --> 1:45:34.760]  And so it's pulling back the curtain now more than ever.
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:39.160]  The problem is some globalist controlled areas are not going to give up on their takeover.
[1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:45.520]  Like Canada, where they've now declared a civil emergency in martial law in Ontario and other
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:47.840]  areas of the world are following suit like Australia.
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:52.640]  So pray for these folks big time, this is a very serious situation, and stay tuned into
[1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:56.440]  infowarstore.com because truth is absolutely paramount.
[1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:00.000]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:04.400]  All over the world from Australia to the United States from Canada to Germany.
[1:46:04.400 --> 1:46:07.880]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do everywhere you go and then coming to your
[1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:13.600]  house and threatening in some cases actually taking people away into the night to their
[1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:14.600]  facilities.
[1:46:14.600 --> 1:46:19.360]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process where they come and take
[1:46:19.360 --> 1:46:23.360]  quote healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:25.160]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:29.360]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many
[1:46:29.360 --> 1:46:33.680]  of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S. government military
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:36.280]  grade at infowarstore.com.

[1:46:59.200 --> 1:47:22.480]  Creating a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:26.480]  Well Alex Stein is here, ladies and gentlemen, and he's going to be leaving us soon and going
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:31.240]  back to Dallas, I want to invite him to come down sometime and co-host with me.
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:33.400]  And his story is just incredible.
[1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:40.280]  His mother was killed, the Everett Silverwhelming Byron Dezevir and that is a default position
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:45.480]  of these people but it's only going to be education that stops them next time because
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.360]  they've said they're going to release a new virus, they've said more variants are coming
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:53.080]  and until Fauci and all of them go to prison for what they've done, they're going to keep
[1:47:53.080 --> 1:47:54.720]  doing it over and over and over again.
[1:47:54.720 --> 1:47:58.680]  If you're a new listener, you're like, wow, this is incredible, folks, we've done endless
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:02.960]  shows with top scientists with all the documents, how they made it, how they created it, how
[1:48:02.960 --> 1:48:05.560]  they went to the Pentagon and said we want to release this in China and they said, are
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:06.560]  you crazy?
[1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:07.560]  That'll start a war.
[1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:11.920]  So Peter Dazek and them did it on their own to take over the planet and they own the patents
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:15.560]  to then treat the very thing they released.
[1:48:15.560 --> 1:48:21.280]  The company set up by Bill Gates and the rest of it, Moderna had the COVID-19 and the spike
[1:48:21.280 --> 1:48:24.200]  protein in 2016.
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:25.200]  This is just incredible.
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:29.280]  Yeah, there's video of him admitting it all before COVID was released or right when it's
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:33.080]  being released before it was announced to cover their ass.
[1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:34.840]  Alex Stein, where do you see all this going?
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:37.840]  Well, let me tell you something, we're under constant trauma-based mind control.
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:41.440]  They want to keep people in that fight-or-flight state of mind so that they can control them
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:44.920]  so you can't see two inches in front of your face but like you said, people are waking
[1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.840]  up but sadly what they're going to do now, what just happened is a beta program for the
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:52.000]  climate change lockdowns for future lockdowns of future variants.
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:55.560]  So if you don't stand up and do something and be civilly disobedient, I'm not saying
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:59.200]  be dumb disobedient, do it with civility because that's what they can't stop.
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:03.480]  If you can be civilly disobedient, then we can actually win this culture war, this whatever
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:04.480]  we're talking about.
[1:49:04.480 --> 1:49:07.200]  Oh yeah, we won round two but I don't mean to interrupt you but I keep meaning to make
[1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:08.200]  this point.
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:10.280]  I don't, keep going, I'm going to make the point in a moment.
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:13.840]  Well, I'm just saying guys, you have to be civilly disobedient.
[1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:16.040]  We have to do something because it's not going to stop.
[1:49:16.040 --> 1:49:17.280]  This is just the beta test.
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:19.520]  This is just the start and they've had viruses.
[1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:23.280]  They've been wanting to do this with SARS, with MERS and they just, they had to do it
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:26.080]  this time because they had to steal an election from Trump with mail-in ballots.
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:29.720]  So they had to pump up this virus and then they had to kill people in order to get us
[1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:31.320]  used to the lockdown lifestyle.
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.800]  So when they do it again, people run to it because there are people that love wearing
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:34.800]  their mask.
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:37.320]  There are people that love the lockdown because their life is such crap, they want to bring
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:38.320]  people down with them.
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:40.680]  Misery loves company and that's what's happening right now.
[1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:43.920]  They keep us all in this state of constant trauma-based mind control so that we bring
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:47.160]  people down with us and that's what's happening, Alex.
[1:49:47.160 --> 1:49:49.640]  You planned it on them, brother.
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:52.040]  Well, I'm not going to stop to the day I die and they're going to have to kill me to stop
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:54.360]  and I know they're going to try to take me out at one point, they're going to try to
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:57.760]  shadow ban me or whatever they can but I'm telling you, I am not going to stop fighting
[1:49:57.760 --> 1:50:01.880]  for the truth until the day I die because we live under constant lies and people need
[1:50:01.880 --> 1:50:03.720]  to understand that.
[1:50:03.720 --> 1:50:04.720]  Absolutely.
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:08.680]  You know, I think you should, I think everybody should do what you do and go to city halls,
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:13.400]  county commission, school boards and just speak about whatever issues you want and the people
[1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.240]  should be heard and just through those venues, all of it basically goes viral.
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:21.680]  I mean, even if just the school board or the city council hears you and those watching
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.320]  a local cable see you, you're reaching thousands but when it gets picked up, you're reaching
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:27.320]  tens of millions.
[1:50:27.320 --> 1:50:29.840]  I mean, your latest video has got to have 30 million views.
[1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:32.520]  Oh yeah, I mean, it's been shared by every single big account too.
[1:50:32.520 --> 1:50:34.360]  You know, even the stupid young Turks fell for it.
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:35.360]  I don't know if you saw that.
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:37.880]  They played it and they said it was their favorite video ever.
[1:50:37.880 --> 1:50:38.880]  They're such imbeciles.
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:39.880]  They believe that.
[1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:40.880]  They didn't get the satire.
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:41.880]  They didn't get, that's how dumb they are.
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:44.880]  They're so evil, they thought they could trick their viewers.
[1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:45.880]  I think you underestimate.
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:50.200]  Well, maybe they've taken videos of me with one and two second clips and totally edited
[1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:51.720]  them together to say the opposite.
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:52.720]  They are really evil.
[1:50:52.720 --> 1:50:54.560]  They're fully funded by George Soros.
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:55.560]  No, they're the worst.
[1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:58.160]  And guys, you don't realize this George Soros guy that we're talking about, he's putting
[1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:00.400]  all these crooked district attorneys in all these cities.
[1:51:00.400 --> 1:51:03.040]  They're poisoning us from the inside, from the very small local.
[1:51:03.040 --> 1:51:05.000]  So they can then medically terror kill us.
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:08.680]  He also had them do the strange to weaponize marijuana where it causes brain damage to
[1:51:08.680 --> 1:51:09.680]  schizophrenia.
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:10.680]  Yeah, but forget about the marijuana.
[1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:13.720]  It's terrible, but they have Chinese fentanyl coming through the border that are murdering
[1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:14.720]  my friends.
[1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.000]  I've had friends die of a drug overdose.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  They thought they were taking Vicodin and that was a pressed pill with fentanyl.
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:22.080]  So it's not some accident that this Chinese fentanyl is killing everybody.
[1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:23.080]  They like it.
[1:51:23.080 --> 1:51:24.080]  They want you to be sad.
[1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:26.460]  They want your child to die and that is not hyperbole.
[1:51:26.460 --> 1:51:29.960]  They want to murder you, make you feel guilty about it so they can control you even more.
[1:51:29.960 --> 1:51:30.960]  And I want to be clear.
[1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:36.160]  I've always been for drug decriminalization, but the marijuana now is not the marijuana
[1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:38.280]  it was even 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[1:51:38.280 --> 1:51:44.520]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I smoked some pot with Mike Tyson and was stoned for two
[1:51:44.520 --> 1:51:45.520]  days.
[1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  Okay.
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:47.520]  And that interview is coming out soon.
[1:51:47.520 --> 1:51:48.520]  And Mike's a good guy.
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:50.320]  I don't think he's put people in prison for it.
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.680]  The whole point is, is that this is extremely strong and people that don't have any drive,
[1:51:55.680 --> 1:51:56.680]  it'll destroy them.
[1:51:56.680 --> 1:51:57.680]  Yeah.
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:58.680]  But Alex, it's not just the drugs.
[1:51:58.680 --> 1:52:00.120]  I mean, there's a reason there's a liquor store in every corner.
[1:52:00.120 --> 1:52:04.280]  They want you dumb, drunk, high and stoned on purpose so that you cannot actually go
[1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:05.680]  after the people that are causing you.
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:06.680]  You're absolutely right.
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:07.680]  There's no doubt alcohol is even worse.
[1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:08.680]  Right.
[1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:11.840]  And I mean, listen, I'm not some, you know, T total, everybody life is short, have some
[1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:16.040]  fun, but at the same time, do not let these people, these evil people influence you to
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:18.160]  make decisions that are going to kill you at the end of the day.
[1:52:18.160 --> 1:52:22.520]  Well, yeah, I mean, they're setting up a medical biomedical surveillance tyranny, bringing
[1:52:22.520 --> 1:52:26.840]  a world government on it, admitting that, and now getting ready for new lockdowns and
[1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:27.840]  new attacks.
[1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:29.360]  Other parts of the world are still locked down.
[1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:30.880]  We have got to say no to this.
[1:52:30.880 --> 1:52:34.640]  We've got to not just let them squeeze us and then they turn loose for a minute and squeeze
[1:52:34.640 --> 1:52:35.640]  us even tighter.
[1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:37.440]  I've told her by that's the plan.
[1:52:37.440 --> 1:52:40.040]  They have psychological graphs explaining how they're doing it.
[1:52:40.040 --> 1:52:41.720]  We've got to come together and say no.
[1:52:41.720 --> 1:52:42.720]  I mean, here they are.
[1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:46.160]  Well, they're now announcing climate lockdowns because of Putin, because there's not enough
[1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:48.440]  energy as they turn off the energy everywhere.
[1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:51.400]  Well, Alex, look at every CVS is adding a doctor there.
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:54.240]  What's going to happen is in the very near future, you're not even going to go to a doctor.
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:55.240]  It's going to be all telemedicine.
[1:52:55.240 --> 1:52:58.040]  And like you've said before, all shots and drugs, yeah, you're going to be talking to
[1:52:58.040 --> 1:52:59.040]  a doctor in New York.
[1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:01.360]  You're going to say, and they're going to say, oh, you're getting a team of doctors at the
[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:03.040]  same time where you're doing it over Skype.
[1:53:03.040 --> 1:53:06.000]  And these doctors are going to prescribe something that's literally going to kill you.
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:09.440]  They are actually disconnecting us from actually trying to get out.
[1:53:09.440 --> 1:53:11.440]  They're just pill dispensers for big pharma.
[1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:12.440]  100%.
[1:53:12.440 --> 1:53:15.560]  And if you want the right pill, ivermectin, you can't even have it.
[1:53:15.560 --> 1:53:17.480]  So the pills they give you are crap.
[1:53:17.480 --> 1:53:18.880]  They want you dead.
[1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:20.200]  I'm not saying that.
[1:53:20.200 --> 1:53:21.920]  That's not cliche.
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:23.040]  Absolutely, my friend.
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:27.680]  I mean, their depopulationist, Bill Gates and all of Peter Dazik says he wants to depopulate.
[1:53:27.680 --> 1:53:29.720]  And then he runs a deadly bio lab.
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:31.240]  I mean, it's like 12 monkeys.
[1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:32.560]  Well, look at William Gates Sr.
[1:53:32.560 --> 1:53:33.840]  That's Bill Gates's dad.
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:35.480]  Started Planned Parenthood with Margaret Sanger.
[1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:38.680]  Planned Parenthood kills babies.
[1:53:38.680 --> 1:53:40.680]  There's nothing more evil than killing a baby.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:42.640]  They talk about, oh, that's women's health care.
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:44.120]  What about that baby's health care?
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:45.120]  They don't care about that.
[1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:47.400]  And as a matter of fact, they're trying to pass legislation where they can kill a baby
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:48.400]  28 days after birth.
[1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:49.400]  That's not a joke.
[1:53:49.400 --> 1:53:50.400]  28 days after birth.
[1:53:50.400 --> 1:53:51.400]  Think about that.
[1:53:51.400 --> 1:53:55.280]  They're ultra rich people that want to get rid of the rest of us.
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:57.200]  And if we let them do it, we deserve it.
[1:53:57.200 --> 1:53:59.960]  Well, you know, sadly, we don't deserve it, but I know what you're saying because we're
[1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:00.960]  letting them do it.
[1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:01.960]  We're giving them consent.
[1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:03.880]  What they do is they trick us into giving us consent.
[1:54:03.880 --> 1:54:06.080]  And they have to do that for their karma.
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:07.520]  And they know what they're doing.
[1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:10.120]  But the sad thing is everybody else doesn't, Alex.
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:11.120]  All right.
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:16.760]  Listen, I want to invite you back again very, very soon to be in studio with us again.
[1:54:16.760 --> 1:54:20.720]  Tell everybody how they follow you, how they find you and the great work you're doing.
[1:54:20.720 --> 1:54:23.240]  Guys, you can follow me, Alex 999.
[1:54:23.240 --> 1:54:24.680]  If you can't find me, you're not looking.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:27.120]  But I just want to say, and I'm not just trying to plug, but guys, you guys need to
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  support Alex.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:31.120]  He's lost his First Amendment right of freedom of speech.
[1:54:31.120 --> 1:54:35.160]  And now he's going through an actual legal battle that is unfair for what he said was
[1:54:35.160 --> 1:54:36.160]  the truth.
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:37.560]  But guys, it's never going to end.
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:39.400]  Alex is just, he's just an example.
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.400]  It's going to happen to you.
[1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:41.600]  It's going to happen to me.
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:42.920]  He's just the tip of the spear.
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:46.600]  So we need to protect Alex at all costs because by protecting him, you protect people like
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:48.160]  me because I wouldn't be where I am today.
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:51.880]  I wouldn't be making viral videos if it wasn't for a guy like this opening my eyes.
[1:54:51.880 --> 1:54:56.280]  So guys, all I can say is please come and support me, but definitely support the info
[1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:57.280]  award.
[1:54:57.280 --> 1:54:58.280]  Sure.
[1:54:58.280 --> 1:54:59.280]  You just do a lot of great videos.
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:00.280]  I like your man on the street.
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:01.280]  It's great.
[1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:02.280]  It's great.
[1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:03.280]  You do a lot of diverse stuff.
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:04.840]  People can find it at Conspiracy Castle.
[1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:06.800]  Everywhere you've got a great page on Bandai Video.
[1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:07.800]  Listen, I'm fine.
[1:55:07.800 --> 1:55:11.360]  And in fact, 20% of people used to hate me now.
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:15.120]  I walk down the street all I get is love because people really are awake now.
[1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:17.560]  Now they've got to put that awakeness into action.
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:22.760]  Our issue is we built Bandai Video and all of this and we have to pay for our own bandwidth
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:27.280]  and our own systems and our own uplinks and our own crew and all the infrastructure that
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:31.200]  costs millions and millions of dollars a quarter.
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:33.080]  People say, well, why doesn't everybody just start their own network?
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:35.080]  Why doesn't everybody just start their own servers?
[1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:38.480]  Well, you can go get a video server thing and have a little site you've got with a few
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:41.960]  thousand viewers here and there and your bill will be a few hundred bucks a month.
[1:55:41.960 --> 1:55:46.560]  When you're getting five, six, seven, eight million views a day, which some days we get
[1:55:46.560 --> 1:55:50.720]  10 million, most days about five million alone at Bandai Video.
[1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:52.920]  Those are people watching those videos.
[1:55:52.920 --> 1:55:54.480]  And it's just when you click on it, it counts.
[1:55:54.480 --> 1:55:56.400]  Well, some videos are long, some are short.
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:55:59.560]  We serve out people's films that are censored that are two hours long.
[1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:03.600]  That cost us thousands of thousands of dollars when one of their films gets five hundred
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:04.960]  to a million views.
[1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:07.240]  And I'm not bitching.
[1:56:07.240 --> 1:56:13.000]  I'm just simply saying you cannot fund a better tip of the spear with the biggest sale in
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.960]  our history running 25 to 75 percent off a lot of t-shirts, books and films that are
[1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.440]  excellent, that are amazing, that I've got to move out a clearance sale to get funds
[1:56:22.440 --> 1:56:23.440]  even into operate.
[1:56:23.440 --> 1:56:26.120]  This is our biggest sale ever up to 75 percent off.
[1:56:26.120 --> 1:56:29.560]  A bunch of amazing t-shirts that I never wore, never promoted on air.
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:30.560]  I wore them privately.
[1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:34.320]  They're like, hey, man, you've made like 50 shirts designs last year, Alex.
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:35.320]  Most of these I designed.
[1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:36.320]  So some are great.
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:37.720]  Some are okay.
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:42.120]  This is why we have a shortfall in just this quarter of $300,000.
[1:56:42.120 --> 1:56:45.160]  So I need to move all this excess inventory out.
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:46.880]  A lot of the other stuff has already been sold out.
[1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:53.040]  This is the stuff that hasn't sold out or just came back into stock like the great Biotree
[1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:57.000]  Selenium, 40 percent off, Vaso Beats, 40 percent off.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.200]  Again, those sell out quickly, but I'm offering those this kind of two.
[1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:05.200]  The Super Magnesium, a fizzy drink that has both the different types of magnesium.
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:07.240]  It's really high end at a low price.
[1:57:07.240 --> 1:57:09.080]  It's back in stock 25 percent off.
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:11.960]  A vitamin D3, high quality gummies, 25 percent off.
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:14.480]  It's all at infowarkshore.com.
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:20.200]  But we've got Save the Frogs, infowars.com, flags that are big nice flags, $9.95.
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:23.560]  T-shirts is low as $5 at cost.
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:27.520]  Some of them we've got bullet bottle openers.
[1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:28.520]  We've got so much.
[1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:30.360]  We've got Let's Go Brandon shirts.
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:35.920]  We've got it all infowarshore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three,
[1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:36.920]  nine.
[1:57:36.920 --> 1:57:37.920]  Do you got to go?
[1:57:37.920 --> 1:57:38.920]  No, I mean, I can stay out.
[1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:42.320]  Why don't you hold over another 30 minutes with us because we're going to go into overdrive
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:44.600]  here in just a few minutes on the other side.
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:45.600]  And I got to wrap.
[1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:46.600]  I can't.
[1:57:46.600 --> 1:57:49.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.440]  I need your help keeping infowars on the air and strong.
[1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:56.480]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:57:57.640]  I was born for this.
[1:57:57.640 --> 1:57:58.640]  You were born for this.
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:03.480]  And people are really waking up right now, but we had to build our own infrastructure
[1:58:03.480 --> 1:58:07.840]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[1:58:07.840 --> 1:58:12.520]  And now with Band-Aid video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform
[1:58:12.520 --> 1:58:18.040]  for thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content
[1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:19.320]  free of charge.
[1:58:19.320 --> 1:58:25.880]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch 22 info wars and Band-Aid video have
[1:58:25.880 --> 1:58:31.400]  become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide, but the expenses
[1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:35.920]  in bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds of thousands
[1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:36.920]  of dollars a month.
[1:58:36.920 --> 1:58:41.080]  So the biggest sale in info wars history is going right now, the mega emergency blowout
[1:58:41.080 --> 1:58:46.680]  sale up to 75% off, getting credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever.
[1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:51.320]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet is still unaware that there's a war
[1:58:51.320 --> 1:58:56.960]  between free individuals and nation states on one side and the globalist on the other
[1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:02.080]  who are literally trying to create a post-human world from the United States to Brazil, and
[1:59:02.080 --> 1:59:04.760]  of course triggered by the Brexit in the UK.
[1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:08.440]  Nations were pulling out of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:13.880]  That's why they launched their great recess and their program after collapsing us of build
[1:59:13.880 --> 1:59:15.640]  back better.
[1:59:15.640 --> 1:59:21.640]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation of the world economy because
[1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:26.560]  they couldn't take our guns because we wouldn't bow because the left, which is the ideology
[1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:32.400]  of this world government system could win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:37.280]  Now we know two years ago, we learned about it about 20 months ago, it's that simple.
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:41.640]  They can't be because of our free speech and our guns, so the global corporate combine
[1:59:41.640 --> 1:59:46.480]  released COVID-19 and you know the rest of this history, expose this peri-
