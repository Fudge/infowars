[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.759]  [Music]
[00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.920]  It's Sunday, March 20th, 2022.
[00:00:18.057 --> 00:00:27.665]  You have found the embattled, bloodied, punished, but in ways stronger than ever, tip of the spear, promoting truth, justice, and a human future.
[00:00:28.885 --> 00:00:38.112]  I'm going to be live here this evening with an incredible four-hour broadcast, not just my own Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m., but Sunday Live, normally hosted by Owen Schroyer.
[00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:39.654]  I'll be hosting that as well.
[00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:42.015]  We have a special guest in studio coming up.
[00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:44.021]   I'll tell you a little bit About later.
[00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:52.892]  Every time I start the broadcast now, I tend to say, man, I've got to really be good today and try to cover all this because it's all so incredibly important.
[00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:54.854]  We're definitely going to be doing that today.
[00:00:55.775 --> 00:01:02.503]  But here's the show broadcast headline today that I really think tells you everything you need to know.
[00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:11.087]  When I make a statement like this, I put a lot of calculus and a lot of pieces of information into it that would take days to lay out.
[00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:35.418]   I'm going to lay out some of it, but what you need to know is that the Russians are warning that the deep state, the globalist deep state, we'll put the show headline up, it's up, it's live, but the globalist deep state Maybe planning a massive false flag by assassinating U.S.
[00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:36.959]  officials, including Joe Biden.
[00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:59.751]  Now, when I saw that Russian report, and I noticed that Biden is going to be in Europe for the NATO summit this week, this week starting today, and you add everything else together, I have always believed, and you know this, that they're going to assassinate Biden.
[00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.051]  It never made sense how they were running a corpse.
[00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:06.372]  It never made sense how he would destroy them in the ratings.
[00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:09.313]  Never made sense about what would they do before the midterms.
[00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:24.437]  But by killing him, just like John Wilkes Booth killed Lincoln, he will then have the quote, Reconstruction 2.0, or martial law in America, which will also then be blamed on the Russians.
[00:02:25.057 --> 00:02:30.782]   So we'll have a domestic crackdown, They've already geared up with January 6th as the cover story.
[00:02:32.262 --> 00:02:43.729]  They'll have an international crackdown, going after the Russians and others, and really hand dictatorial power to the Deep State and the Democrats, which they will never relinquish again.
[00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.274]  The perfect false flag would be the assassination of Biden.
[00:02:53.374 --> 00:03:01.111]   Now, for those of you that don't know how World War I started, I'm going to get into it when we come back, but this is a big, big deal.
[00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:10.434]  So there's your full show headline that everybody should share, like World War III depends on it, like stopping World War III depends on it.
[00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:14.595]  Because I don't just say things like this to be a fiction writer.
[00:03:14.775 --> 00:03:16.096]  This is a real possibility.
[00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:25.716]   Emergency Sunday broadcast Russia warns Deet State may assassinate Biden, trigger massive escalation and war.
[00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:42.716]  So, we're talking about a massive escalation in the war.
[00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:44.516]  .
[00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:47.696]  And that's what we're dealing with as a society and as a civilization.
[00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:51.639]  And I don't just believe what the Russians say.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.761]  I know the New World Order's history.
[00:03:56.061 --> 00:04:01.084]  I know how British intelligence, that's kind of the key operating system of this, operates.
[00:04:02.293 --> 00:04:06.156]  And the minute I saw that this morning, I got chills up and down my spine.
[00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:15.284]  And that's when my spirit, or subconscious, whatever you want to call it, is much more powerful than your conscious mind, says, look at this.
[00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:20.989]  Because the Russians didn't say they think they're going to try to kill Biden.
[00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:21.929]  I'm saying that.
[00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.534]  They said they got intel that they have plans to kill senior diplomats and U.S.
[00:04:27.574 --> 00:04:28.054]  officials.
[00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:30.897]  Well, who's more senior than the puppet Biden?
[00:04:31.903 --> 00:04:39.845]  And then I saw the other headline on Infowars.com that he's going to Europe for the NATO summit.
[00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:43.886]  This is when you get a missile fired or a car bomb, something like that.
[00:04:45.406 --> 00:04:49.647]  And then they all claim it's some multinational pro-Russia group that's involved in it.
[00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:51.728]  And then we're off the races, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:54.569]  We need to pray for Joe Biden's safety.
[00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:55.829]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.298 --> 00:05:09.298]  [music]
[00:05:09.298 --> 00:05:14.298]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:28.298]  [music]
[00:05:28.623 --> 00:05:32.306]  Thank you for joining us on this live Sunday transmission.
[00:05:32.406 --> 00:05:34.267]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:34.287 --> 00:05:37.709]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours this evening.
[00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.791]  This is going to be an incredibly important transmission.
[00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:43.032]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:05:43.172 --> 00:05:44.313]  All right, here's where we are.
[00:05:46.434 --> 00:06:10.327]   The planets have aligned politically, militarily, economically, And everybody keeps asking the question, how can Biden, who can't finish a sentence, how can Biden, who has under 30% approval ratings, even in Cook polls that are pro-Democrat, means his real approval is about 15%, how can the deep state grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:11.208]  And I've said this.
[00:06:12.162 --> 00:06:13.422]  Over and over again the last year.
[00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:14.843]  Assassinate Biden.
[00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:16.603]  I'm not calling for assassinating Biden.
[00:06:17.203 --> 00:06:24.025]  Let the globalists wind up some lunatic, have the security stand down, or detonate a truck bomb, or poison him.
[00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.085]  There's a million ways to do it.
[00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:31.007]  And then blame it on their political enemies, or just say he died in his sleep.
[00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:37.788]  Because then that turns him into a victim, and now there's a big funeral, and now they can slip in the next puppets that they want into place.
[00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:51.126]   But you talk about dumb, dumber, and even more dumb, If he dies, then you get Kamala Harris, and then after him rolls in the Speaker of the House, and you know who that is, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:06:52.848 --> 00:06:57.092]  And these old Crypt Keepers, these Skeksis, are not going to turn loose of power.
[00:06:57.152 --> 00:07:04.139]  So I've really been talking about the danger of them assassinating Biden in the last year.
[00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:05.561]  It's the only way it fits.
[00:07:07.082 --> 00:07:09.743]  So that they can again push forward their agenda.
[00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:14.884]  And my mother hardly ever gets in my face about something, but when she does, she's always right.
[00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:19.945]  And she's been ranting for a good six months when I see her that they're going to kill Biden.
[00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:22.266]  She just sees it in all the tea leaves.
[00:07:22.786 --> 00:07:24.066]  She sees it in the preparation.
[00:07:24.146 --> 00:07:25.447]  She sees it all over the place.
[00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:29.648]  And my mom and dad are just as smart as I am and have always had a lot of foresight.
[00:07:30.748 --> 00:07:32.569]  But I think a lot of you see this as well.
[00:07:32.609 --> 00:07:33.909]  I mean, how do they get rid of him?
[00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:35.783]  Does he step down?
[00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:36.743]  No, he'll never do that.
[00:07:37.544 --> 00:07:41.785]  He'll still be seen as evil and corrupt and all the bad things he's done, he'll still get the blame for.
[00:07:42.125 --> 00:07:52.027]  But if he's assassinated, they can demonize their political opposition and they can expand wars and they can have the giant police state they've set up as a bear trap close on our leg.
[00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:57.188]  And then I saw these big articles today on InfoWars.com.
[00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:09.492]   Senior advisor to Zelensky invites Biden to Kiev next week if he's brave When the Commander-in-Chief visits Europe for NATO Summit next week.
[00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:26.578]  Ukrainian official number two, Andr Zelensky, invited President Joe Biden to visit Kiev next week amid Russia's ongoing invasion of the country, saying, one should not be afraid if you're brave, said Zelensky's chief diplomatic advisor.
[00:08:27.938 --> 00:08:35.623]   So if you're brave, Caesar, you'll go during the ides of March To the Roman Forum.
[00:08:36.163 --> 00:08:37.143]  You'll be safe there.
[00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:38.143]  You know what happened to him.
[00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:40.524]  Warning!
[00:08:40.544 --> 00:08:45.465]  Global Deep State may be planning assassination of President Biden when he travels to Europe next week.
[00:08:45.485 --> 00:08:58.849]  An excellent article that Jamie White and I put together this morning that deals with all of this and gives you some historical examples of what's been going on and unfolding, including how World War I started in 1914.
[00:09:02.014 --> 00:09:19.310]  When groups connected to the British Secret Service of the Black Hand subgroup, Serbia's Black Hand connected to the British Secret Service, assassinated the king of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, which of course Germany was the capital of, Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
[00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.172]  So that's a big deal.
[00:09:23.053 --> 00:09:25.396]  All the same parallels of that war.
[00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:27.809]  And why are we talking about that?
[00:09:27.929 --> 00:09:31.850]  Well, again, Biden's traveling to NATO next week, to Brussels, Belgium.
[00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:52.277]  And we've got the Russians warning and saying that they have intercepted and arrested Canadian intelligence operatives, high level, that tell them that is the next big shoe to drop, that there are plans to assassinate American officials and leaders.
[00:09:53.717 --> 00:09:56.700]  To be blamed on Russia.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.822]  Now, would Russia assassinate U.S.
[00:09:58.862 --> 00:09:59.162]  leaders?
[00:09:59.242 --> 00:09:59.422]  No.
[00:09:59.462 --> 00:10:00.423]  That would blow up in their face.
[00:10:01.944 --> 00:10:03.746]  Would Russia have a motive to kill U.S.
[00:10:03.766 --> 00:10:04.026]  leaders?
[00:10:04.547 --> 00:10:05.107]  Absolutely not.
[00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:06.649]  They would turn them into the devil overnight.
[00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:08.130]  That's the worst possible move.
[00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.272]  Well, then who has a motive to kill U.S.
[00:10:10.292 --> 00:10:10.752]  diplomats?
[00:10:10.772 --> 00:10:12.434]  Who has a motive to kill?
[00:10:15.336 --> 00:10:16.017]  Well, you know who.
[00:10:16.437 --> 00:10:17.038]  The deep state.
[00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:20.181]  They have the motive for all of that.
[00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:30.521]  And so I see that as them killing two birds with one stone, and it's a very, very serious concern to me.
[00:10:32.662 --> 00:10:33.743]  Let me go ahead and just do this.
[00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:38.906]  Let me just go ahead and read this article from InfoWars.com as it covers all the facts.
[00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:39.626]  Warning!
[00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:43.889]  Global Deep State may be planning assassination of President Biden when he travels to Europe next week.
[00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:47.090]  Russians warn Zelensky government planning false flag against U.S.
[00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:47.771]  government leaders.
[00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:59.942]  In pretext to expand war, Joe Biden has become a liability for the global deep state, which is why they may try to have him assassinated as a way to accelerate a world war against Russia.
[00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:15.043]  Ukraine President Zelensky, Chief Ombudsman, on Saturday asked Biden to visit the embattled city of Kiev next week during his trip to Brussels, saying in a taunting message, one should not be afraid to if you are brave.
[00:11:16.023 --> 00:11:20.445]  Inviting a sitting president to an active war zone is probably not the wisest idea.
[00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:23.107]  Yeah, anybody asking you to do it wants you to get killed.
[00:11:23.547 --> 00:11:32.578]   Coincidentally, this comes amid reports by the Russian military that they have received intelligence of Ukrainian nationalist hardliners planning to target U.S.
[00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:35.038]  and Western military installations.
[00:11:35.458 --> 00:11:47.841]  The officer spoke about a planned terrorist acts in Lvov, the city's Russian language name, against employees and facilities of the diplomatic missions maintained by the U.S.
[00:11:47.861 --> 00:12:00.449]   and other Western nations, said Russia's Defense Minister, Major General Igor, I'm not going to butcher that, What's more, the Ukrainian government is apparently aware of this plot, but is doing nothing to stop it.
[00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:10.216]  I'd like to stress that Kiev regime is fully aware of the plans abroad by nationalists, but is doing nothing to prevent them, he said.
[00:12:11.037 --> 00:12:13.098]  The plans being harbored by nationalists.
[00:12:13.859 --> 00:12:20.139]   the state when the stage appears to be set to have Biden assassinated during his diplomatic
[00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.139]  visit to Europe.
[00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:25.218]   So the scenario would echo the prelude to World War I where Austrian Archduke Franz
[00:12:25.218 --> 00:12:30.459]   Ferdinand's assassination by Serbians, black hand terrorists in 1914, was actually orchestrated
[00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:32.259]  by British Secret Service.
[00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:35.819]   Biden's assassination could potentially be extremely useful to the globalists, not just
[00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:41.099]   as a spark for global war, but also alleviate political fallout for Democrats in America.
[00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:45.299]   The Democrats are getting dragged down politically because of Biden's terrible polling due to
[00:12:45.299 --> 00:12:49.218]  disastrous radical domestic and foreign policy positions.
[00:12:49.882 --> 00:12:59.009]  Bracing for massive losses in the incoming midterms, Democrats have even been discussing amongst themselves how best to replace Biden before 2024.
[00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:07.075]  At this point, the globalist Biden is now more useful dead than alive, which is a precarious situation for the whole world.
[00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:18.060]  However, in a veiled response to Ukraine's request, Biden's Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday that Biden would not travel to Ukraine during his visit to Brussels.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:28.130]  Biden is instead scheduled to appear at NATO's meeting to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts against Russia and the G7 meeting with European leaders.
[00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:31.634]  Hopefully, his bumbling European visit will go off without a hitch.
[00:13:33.775 --> 00:13:35.236]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:40.657]  Hopefully nothing happens to the satanic pedophile version of Dr. Magoo or Mr. Magoo.
[00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:45.919]  Here's the big article, Russia warns of false flag attacks on U.S.
[00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:46.459]  diplomats.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.561]  You should go read the article for yourself on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:51.892 --> 00:13:55.114]  Some good news Ukraine and Russia close to agreement on critical issues.
[00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:58.475]  Turkey says we'll see if that turns out to be true.
[00:13:59.236 --> 00:14:04.298]  NATO should not expand to the east says top Chinese implement a day after Xi and Biden had talks.
[00:14:05.739 --> 00:14:11.019]   Russian defense ministers, there's over 100 Ukrainian covert op troops and foreign mercenaries
[00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:17.018]   eliminated west of Kiev in a huge weapon cache that the West was blown up.
[00:14:17.018 --> 00:14:24.298]   Excellent article at Zero Hedge by Chris Hedges, also on InfoWars, "Waltzing Towards Armageddon."
[00:14:24.298 --> 00:14:25.778]  You need to go read this article.
[00:14:25.778 --> 00:14:27.339]  This is very balanced and very accurate.
[00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:32.019]   There's another video we're going to be playing coming up with the great Laura Logan knocking
[00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:33.739]  it out of the park, explaining what's really going on.
[00:14:33.698 --> 00:14:35.839]  That's coming up as well with so much more.
[00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:41.482]  Meanwhile, we've got all these former war criminal presidents calling for a big war against Russia.
[00:14:42.302 --> 00:14:45.704]  Bush, Clinton, and Obama.
[00:14:45.524 --> 00:14:52.803]   We got video of that next segment and then giant COVID news, economy news, censorship news and more.
[00:14:52.803 --> 00:15:09.803]  [MUSIC]
[00:15:09.641 --> 00:15:11.641]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:15:11.641 --> 00:15:28.081]   If I tried to go over all the fake war propaganda put out by Zelensky in Ukraine, we would never
[00:15:28.081 --> 00:15:30.200]  have enough time on air to play it all or go over it all.
[00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:32.262]  And the Russians have lied as well.
[00:15:33.564 --> 00:15:34.865]  That's what happens in these type of wars.
[00:15:36.135 --> 00:15:41.098]  The Russians lied about invading, the Russians lied about the time of the invasion, they lied about how big the invasion would be.
[00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:44.321]  Because you definitely want to lie if you're about to invade somebody, you don't want them to know.
[00:15:45.341 --> 00:15:48.183]  So let's make no mistake, the Russians aren't little saints here either.
[00:15:48.904 --> 00:15:56.709]  But the way our media says Zelensky and the Ukrainians are saints, when it comes to lying, it's the slickest, most orchestrated thing I've ever seen.
[00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:59.411]  Because it's being run by the CIA.
[00:15:59.851 --> 00:16:21.200]   And I told you that a month ago, I told you that years ago, because it's on record, but now even the CIA was in Yahoo and Bloomberg, as you know, last week, bragging that they helped overthrow the elected Ukrainian government in 2014, and bragging that they've been in a proxy war on the border with Russia, killing Russians ever since.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.622]  I don't want my government and my country doing covert wars.
[00:16:26.062 --> 00:16:29.043]  The CIA has overthrown hundreds of countries.
[00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.844]  The Russians have overthrown a couple dozen.
[00:16:31.744 --> 00:16:33.665]  They tried to compete with us and they couldn't even do it.
[00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:36.924]  And what's our government put in?
[00:16:36.964 --> 00:16:38.005]  Authoritarian groups.
[00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:43.009]  Zelensky just banned 11 opposition parties.
[00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:45.150]  He banned all opposition parties.
[00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:50.154]  Pro-Russia, anti-Russia, liberal, conservative, Christian, Catholic.
[00:16:50.955 --> 00:16:51.295]  Banned.
[00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:52.997]  He's a dictator.
[00:16:54.578 --> 00:16:56.559]  The Nazis banned all parties but their party.
[00:16:59.642 --> 00:17:02.584]  And Putin's done a lot of stuff too, authoritarian censorship.
[00:17:02.984 --> 00:17:07.325]   But compared to Zelensky, Well, he can't hold a candle up.
[00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:10.087]  And the left's like, yeah, ban everybody!
[00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:11.428]  He's so great!
[00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:21.215]  I've got stacks of articles and videos here where they have famous models and famous actors in Eastern Europe.
[00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:27.753]   I mean, Zelensky himself is a famous guy that would do drag queen shows and Gay bonded shows.
[00:17:27.773 --> 00:17:30.034]  I mean, that's why they have him compromised and controlled.
[00:17:30.614 --> 00:17:31.835]  Not the first time we've seen this.
[00:17:32.496 --> 00:17:36.798]  We've seen him dancing in the leather high heels and leather outfits, shaking his ass.
[00:17:37.839 --> 00:17:44.923]  But I got stacks of articles here of well-known Ukrainian actresses posing as pregnant women, posing as dead women.
[00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:48.986]  I mean, they don't even care, because it's for the rest of the world.
[00:17:50.407 --> 00:17:51.588]  And I've got them right here in my stack.
[00:17:52.648 --> 00:18:11.322]  So that's insulting to me to hear from CNN and ABC News and to hear from the Democratic Party and the neocons like Mitt Romney that if you question anything like Laura Logan does or Alex Jones does or Tucker Carlson does or Tulsi Gabbard does, you are a traitor.
[00:18:12.943 --> 00:18:15.885]  It's treason to not want war with Russia.
[00:18:17.987 --> 00:18:19.148]  What it is is insanity.
[00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:21.170]  And totally mindless.
[00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:27.133]  So, here's a clip from MSNBC, and they've got all these State Department officials and others on them.
[00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:31.915]  This is part of the whole piece of how they're the best, and their propaganda is the best.
[00:18:32.295 --> 00:18:33.796]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:33.856 --> 00:18:41.579]  So, we have a right and a duty to question it, and all my goal here is to just lay everything out the best I can and tell you what I really think is going on.
[00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:45.260]  And we've got a much better track record in mainstream media, which shouldn't be hard.
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.381]  They try to lie to you.
[00:18:47.597 --> 00:18:50.279]  I don't condescend to you like you need me to tell you what to do.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:19:02.450]  I'm going to lay out my best thinking, the best info I've got, lay out the different options, and take your calls and have guests on that bring up other options, and we're right 98% of the time or so.
[00:19:06.734 --> 00:19:10.718]  So, here they are bragging that Zelensky's got the best propaganda.
[00:19:11.961 --> 00:19:15.162]   You also have to figure out a way to tell people about it, right?
[00:19:15.162 --> 00:19:21.001]   And I think the way in which this small team of mostly ex-television producers, who worked
[00:19:21.001 --> 00:19:29.122]   with him for years in Ukraine, have fashioned the most sophisticated political communications
[00:19:29.122 --> 00:19:32.041]  operation I've ever seen in real time.
[00:19:32.036 --> 00:19:37.918]  Every single choice they've made has been brilliant and pitch-perfect, and they have played it.
[00:19:37.978 --> 00:19:46.501]  They understand that in this world we now live in, this very complicated, fragmented media landscape we occupy, that you've got to play it high and low.
[00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:48.942]  You've got to play insurgent and establishment.
[00:19:48.962 --> 00:19:52.303]  You've got to do the interview with Lester Holt, but you've also got to be on TikTok.
[00:19:52.583 --> 00:19:54.404]  You got to be everywhere all at once.
[00:19:54.705 --> 00:19:57.046]  He's out there speaking English, speaking Russian.
[00:19:57.287 --> 00:20:01.289]  He's transmitting on telegram all day long, messages to different audiences.
[00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:11.637]  And then this week, we saw him do this global tour for Hearts and Minds, you know, the spring training games in Canada and the British Parliament, and then coming to the big stage of America.
[00:20:12.037 --> 00:20:25.243]   And again, With a perfectly executed 16-minute speech with video in the middle of it and a switch to English on the back end, I just don't think I've ever seen anything more masterful, purely at the level of performance.
[00:20:25.763 --> 00:20:29.005]  Not just the performance, again, gotta be a hero to look like a hero.
[00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:44.471]   But man, he and his team have done an incredible job making the case for their people and using every media tool And understanding the world we now live in, in terms of media and digital technology, as well as anybody I think ever that we've seen, that we've ever seen.
[00:20:45.392 --> 00:20:46.732]  So that's called gushing.
[00:20:47.433 --> 00:20:49.914]  And that's them telling you what they're doing and how they're doing it.
[00:20:50.534 --> 00:20:53.195]  And again, the CIA in the news going, yeah, we overthrew their government.
[00:20:53.675 --> 00:20:54.916]  Yeah, we're in a war with the Russians.
[00:20:55.977 --> 00:20:57.677]  And so does that legitimize what Putin did?
[00:20:57.917 --> 00:20:59.238]  No, but you see why he did it.
[00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:00.038]  We would do that.
[00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:01.139]  I don't want a war.
[00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.918]  But it's just bull.
[00:21:04.439 --> 00:21:07.244]  And then like, oh look, the Russians can't get their propaganda together.
[00:21:07.685 --> 00:21:10.390]  Oh look, the Russians, you know, their military isn't that powerful.
[00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:11.933]  Putin's already said that.
[00:21:14.991 --> 00:21:16.252]  He said, we don't want to fight you.
[00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:19.375]  They've cut their defense spending massively in the last decade.
[00:21:19.755 --> 00:21:22.718]  They said, we're not in an arms race with you, but you're not moving weapons on our border.
[00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:30.245]  And I got to tell the left out there, the average real liberal is against this war, and every conservative I know is against it as well.
[00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:33.127]  And people are so sick of our government and see it as so evil.
[00:21:33.928 --> 00:21:36.029]  That almost everyone I know is pro-Putin.
[00:21:36.609 --> 00:21:37.609]  I mean, just everybody.
[00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:39.150]  Liberal, conservative, old, young.
[00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.931]  So, their masterful propaganda has failed.
[00:21:42.591 --> 00:21:48.593]  I personally am horrified by this whole thing, and think Putin got tricked into a trap, and they're having to admit that.
[00:21:49.253 --> 00:21:56.756]  And he's getting generals slaughtered, and it's a setup, and the CIA's jamming their communications, and flooding the zone with high-tech weapons.
[00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.257]  And so now this is just going to escalate.
[00:22:01.371 --> 00:22:04.553]  So, this is not good for anybody except the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:05.273 --> 00:22:11.596]  Now, I got some big clips about the first casualty of war being the truth, and about the massive censorship here in America.
[00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:16.618]  Now it ties into the huge revelations with Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:22:16.658 --> 00:22:17.739]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:22:18.219 --> 00:22:23.201]  And then later, I'm going to show you some of the photos and some of the articles where they admit it's fake.
[00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:28.364]  You know, not just the ghost of Kiev being fake, not just Snake Island being fake.
[00:22:29.858 --> 00:22:36.525]  Not just so much of this being fake or these Ukrainian militias hiding in hospitals and schools, which they admit they're doing.
[00:22:37.886 --> 00:22:39.207]  Those are war crimes right there.
[00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:49.316]   But the lying and having the actresses and the actors On record and then admitting that they've got actors out doing it.
[00:22:49.336 --> 00:22:50.417]  We're not denying there's a war.
[00:22:50.437 --> 00:22:51.518]  We're not denying people are dying.
[00:22:52.098 --> 00:22:58.845]  But they are TV producing this and showing old war footage of him from TV shows he was in as if it's real.
[00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:01.047]  They are scripting and producing this.
[00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:03.109]  You just saw MSNBC say it.
[00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:07.693]  And so this is a very dangerous propaganda game.
[00:23:08.578 --> 00:23:11.300]  These individuals are running here.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.501]  So we're going to go to break.
[00:23:12.541 --> 00:23:13.781]  Come back with all this and more.
[00:23:13.882 --> 00:23:15.022]  Infowars.com.
[00:23:15.423 --> 00:23:16.523]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:17.204 --> 00:23:24.329]  We have Alex Stein, the guy with the mega viral rapping videos at city councils, joining us in studio to cover a lot of serious news.
[00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:26.970]  Also a very serious fellow.
[00:23:27.651 --> 00:23:28.711]  Not just the funny side.
[00:23:29.252 --> 00:23:30.433]  Runs the Conspiracy Castle.
[00:23:30.453 --> 00:23:34.115]  And I'm going to be hosting third and fourth hour with just jam-packed information as well.
[00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:35.236]  Please stay with us.

[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.820]  Share the links to Bandai Video.
[00:23:43.462 --> 00:23:44.202]  Big Brother.
[00:23:45.183 --> 00:23:46.424]  Mainstream media.
[00:23:47.505 --> 00:23:48.626]  Government cover-ups.
[00:23:49.286 --> 00:23:50.747]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:23:51.388 --> 00:23:52.709]  Well, so does he.
[00:23:53.308 --> 00:23:58.308]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:04.308]  [Music]
[00:24:04.308 --> 00:24:05.308]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:05.989 --> 00:24:38.959]   Let's drill more into this Russia situation that is a black hole threatening to engulf the entire world economy and all of our speech as well as one of the big casualties of war is also people's freedoms not just the truth but Zelensky who we're told is the most wonderful person the world has ever seen when he was not doing Leather gay bondage shows or transvestite tranny shows on national Ukrainian television.
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:48.066]  And my point is, he's come out and said, oh, the Russians, they've hacked computers and they're probably about to release me and gay porn.
[00:24:48.166 --> 00:24:48.886]  It's not real.
[00:24:50.768 --> 00:24:56.192]  Why do you think Arnold Schwarzenegger always comes out for the wars and says screw your freedom and does all this?
[00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.231]  Pornography with him is in the Getty Collection on record.
[00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:03.432]  35mm film, all of it.
[00:25:03.492 --> 00:25:05.792]  I made a documentary and did some research on Schwarzenegger.
[00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:07.233]  He's about 20 minutes of it.
[00:25:07.733 --> 00:25:11.294]  And that stuff's out there and I've seen it, okay?
[00:25:12.134 --> 00:25:21.717]  Now the point is, they'll put that all over the news and then his tough guy image is gone if you see Arnold Schwarzenegger sucking men off and all the rest of it.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.241]  And so, you know, I made a film about that.
[00:25:25.341 --> 00:25:25.982]  I talked about it.
[00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:27.323]  Schwarzenegger didn't sue me, did he?
[00:25:27.343 --> 00:25:28.903]  Because he's blackmailed.
[00:25:29.724 --> 00:25:30.765]  And listen, here's the issue.
[00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:38.189]  I'm not against Schwarzenegger, that he made a bunch of his money when bodybuilding wasn't huge, before he made money with Wheater on supplements.
[00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:39.610]  They helped pioneer that.
[00:25:41.051 --> 00:25:42.772]  Because he made money doing that.
[00:25:43.532 --> 00:25:44.413]  I'm not putting him down.
[00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:45.453]  I'm not judging him.
[00:25:45.773 --> 00:25:47.114]  The point is, he's compromised.
[00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:49.956]  That's the same thing with Zelensky.
[00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:51.517]  He's compromised.
[00:25:52.788 --> 00:25:56.269]  And so everything this guy does is scripted, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:57.129 --> 00:26:02.191]  Zelensky says World War III assured if negotiations with Russia break down.
[00:26:02.551 --> 00:26:04.672]  I didn't just believe Zero Hedge when I saw that.
[00:26:05.232 --> 00:26:06.892]  That's in the British and the U.S.
[00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:07.312]  news now.
[00:26:07.853 --> 00:26:12.774]  He said World War III's gonna happen if you don't escalate a war that could cause World War III.
[00:26:14.495 --> 00:26:15.635]  Unbelievable information.
[00:26:15.675 --> 00:26:17.356]  And then here's some of the photos I showed you.
[00:26:17.396 --> 00:26:18.556]  Here's some of the famous models.
[00:26:19.704 --> 00:26:21.784]  That's why they hate me talking about crisis actors.
[00:26:22.104 --> 00:26:23.725]  Is every event a crisis actor?
[00:26:24.025 --> 00:26:24.205]  No.
[00:26:24.485 --> 00:26:25.585]  Is every event staged?
[00:26:25.645 --> 00:26:25.845]  No.
[00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:35.347]  But have there been a lot of cases where the UN got caught in Syria staging chemical attacks that turned out to be fake confirmed with the kids on TV that were in the video saying they were hired to do it?
[00:26:36.547 --> 00:26:36.947]  Yes!
[00:26:39.647 --> 00:26:45.468]  Famous actress, famous model dressing up like she's pregnant in one shot and bombed out of a building in another.
[00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:48.509]  And you look at these photos, you can see they're fake to begin with.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:55.506]  So when the Russians bomb a military base or whatever, they just have these folks go and crawl around the rubble and act like they've been hurt.
[00:26:56.988 --> 00:26:59.390]  Because the Russians are not trying to target civilian infrastructure.
[00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.753]  That's just a fact, because they know it makes them look bad.
[00:27:05.097 --> 00:27:10.983]  Now, I want to hit some really, really important news here that deals with all of this.
[00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:14.012]  And deals with disinformation.
[00:27:14.032 --> 00:27:20.538]  And I want to look at what this is doing to the economy and why the globalists are pushing it so hard.
[00:27:21.219 --> 00:27:31.469]  And what oil barons are making money and what oil companies are losing money in this whole artificial energy crisis where the UN is now saying, take away beef?
[00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:37.391]  Take away plentiful chicken, take away fish, take away everything but bugs.
[00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:38.171]  You knew it was coming.
[00:27:38.191 --> 00:27:39.533]  They told you you'll eat bugs and love it.
[00:27:39.873 --> 00:27:40.814]  You'll own nothing and like it.
[00:27:40.854 --> 00:27:41.594]  It's now official.
[00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:42.675]  The U.N.
[00:27:42.695 --> 00:27:52.404]  and the Democratic Party and Bloomberg News is all saying, and Sky News is all saying that you cannot have cars, you cannot have beef, and beef is racist.
[00:27:52.844 --> 00:27:54.625]  That's all coming up next segment.
[00:27:54.926 --> 00:27:57.328]  But let's get to some of these clips talking about disinformation.
[00:27:59.059 --> 00:28:06.442]  Here is the New York Times in a big article that got praised by CNN and Reason and everybody else.
[00:28:07.122 --> 00:28:09.283]  America has a free speech problem.
[00:28:11.804 --> 00:28:14.886]  And it shows an evil drain that is asking questions.
[00:28:14.926 --> 00:28:17.127]  It says, asking questions is bad.
[00:28:17.147 --> 00:28:19.007]  And it's a mind drain.
[00:28:19.348 --> 00:28:24.950]  And it goes on to say, New York Times deserves free speech, but Alex Jones does not, specifically.
[00:28:26.186 --> 00:28:30.929]  If they get their speech, they can say whatever they want about Sarah Palin that they knew they were lying about.
[00:28:30.969 --> 00:28:37.632]  But if Alex Jones might make a mistake and ever admit it, he's got to be taken off air forever.
[00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:41.474]  Oh, the New York Times admits that America has a free speech problem.
[00:28:41.774 --> 00:28:43.795]  Oh, the praise from the news.
[00:28:45.116 --> 00:28:46.257]  Oh, but here's the New York Post.
[00:28:46.617 --> 00:28:47.577]  Spies who lie.
[00:28:48.118 --> 00:28:53.881]  The intelligence experts who falsely discredited Hunter Biden's laptop and still won't say sorry?
[00:28:56.408 --> 00:29:00.170]  Well, of course not, because the Hunter Biden thing was open and shut from the local store.
[00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:01.671]  Where he left it, never got it.
[00:29:01.691 --> 00:29:02.532]  State police had it.
[00:29:02.932 --> 00:29:03.432]  Feds had it.
[00:29:03.472 --> 00:29:04.033]  Everybody saw it.
[00:29:04.073 --> 00:29:05.033]  Everybody had copies of it.
[00:29:05.494 --> 00:29:07.535]  And it was him having sex with children!
[00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:09.736]  You can't have that!
[00:29:10.016 --> 00:29:15.139]  That's used to blackmail Biden and others to control them, just like Zelensky's blackmailed.
[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.821]  With all of his escapades.
[00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:20.483]  Reportedly being a nude dancer at a gay bar.
[00:29:22.924 --> 00:29:24.065]  So let's go to these clips.
[00:29:25.356 --> 00:29:29.820]  Here's the media pundits telling you the laptop didn't exist or was Russian disinfo.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.544]  And then we have some of the latest developments on that front.
[00:29:34.665 --> 00:29:36.146]  Biden secret emails.
[00:29:36.186 --> 00:29:37.347]  A really fishy story.
[00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:43.673]  The Post claimed that the emails were found on a laptop computer that was brought to a repair shop in Delaware in the spring of 2019.
[00:29:43.734 --> 00:29:50.520]  The FBI is now investigating whether those alleged Hunter Biden emails are actually connected to a larger foreign intelligence operation.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:52.022]  For all we know, these emails are made up.
[00:29:51.841 --> 00:29:54.321]  to a foreign intelligence operation.
[00:29:54.321 --> 00:29:56.680]  Foreign intelligence operation.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.001]  Foreign intelligence.
[00:29:58.001 --> 00:29:58.801]  Foreign intelligence.
[00:29:58.801 --> 00:30:00.321]  Foreign intelligence operation.
[00:30:00.321 --> 00:30:02.561]  For all we know, these emails are made up.
[00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:07.961]   The information found on the laptop may be part of a Russian disinformation campaign.
[00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:11.040]  Part of a Russian disinformation effort.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.761]  Described by many intelligence experts as having hallmarks.
[00:30:13.789 --> 00:30:15.311]  All the hallmarks, rather.
[00:30:15.372 --> 00:30:16.734]  All the hallmarks of a Russian.
[00:30:16.954 --> 00:30:17.355]  Russian.
[00:30:17.435 --> 00:30:18.577]  Russian disinformation.
[00:30:18.637 --> 00:30:19.860]  Russian disinformation.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.901]  Disinformation campaign.
[00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:23.907]  This is a classic example of the right-wing media machine.
[00:30:26.582 --> 00:30:31.104]  And here is a flashback, ladies and gentlemen, when Trump brought it up.
[00:30:31.164 --> 00:30:32.385]  He was told, you're Russian.
[00:30:32.405 --> 00:30:34.006]  Disinformation.
[00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:34.966]  It doesn't exist.
[00:30:35.026 --> 00:30:36.627]  Even though they always knew it was real.
[00:30:36.647 --> 00:30:37.847]  It was always certified as real.
[00:30:38.168 --> 00:30:39.288]  The FBI admitted it was real.
[00:30:39.608 --> 00:30:40.248]  But it didn't matter.
[00:30:40.289 --> 00:30:42.670]  Mainstream media would lie.
[00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:47.792]  And then the internet, the corporate giants, the big tech would censor anybody that talked about it.
[00:30:48.632 --> 00:30:51.634]  Our 50 former national intelligence folks.
[00:30:52.315 --> 00:30:56.240]  Who said that what this he's accusing me of is a Russian plant.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.967]  They have said that this is has all the care for five former heads of the CIA.
[00:31:02.367 --> 00:31:05.631]  Both parties say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage.
[00:31:06.392 --> 00:31:07.954]  Nobody believes it except them.
[00:31:08.314 --> 00:31:10.276]  His and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.
[00:31:10.656 --> 00:31:14.579]  You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?
[00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:16.480]  That's exactly what it's called.
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.941]  Is this where you're going?
[00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:18.722]  This is where he's going.
[00:31:18.982 --> 00:31:21.344]  The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?
[00:31:21.364 --> 00:31:22.945]  Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue of race.
[00:31:23.005 --> 00:31:24.086]  You have to be kidding.
[00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:25.607]  Here we go again with Russia.
[00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:30.615]  And then Hunter got three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife and so much more.
[00:31:31.597 --> 00:31:33.179]  Here is Fox doing a great job.
[00:31:33.199 --> 00:31:36.063]  Won't have time to play the full clip, but we'll add it in post later when we archive this.
[00:31:36.444 --> 00:31:38.207]  This is Harris Faulkner knocking it out of the park.
[00:31:40.004 --> 00:31:41.025]  I have a different question.
[00:31:41.225 --> 00:31:43.107]  How thick are the thieves of truth?
[00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:52.416]  Because I remember another media outlet, and let's go ahead and throw them in as a media outlet and not some just outlier of social platform Twitter.
[00:31:52.897 --> 00:32:01.705]  Because remember, they want to put their thumb on the scale about what is factual and what is information and what is disinformation and what is disqualification.
[00:32:02.626 --> 00:32:03.247]  All of that.
[00:32:03.507 --> 00:32:05.510]  So I guess they think they're journalists.
[00:32:06.011 --> 00:32:10.778]  So let's just do the mind experiment for just a second and pretend like they're journalists.
[00:32:11.198 --> 00:32:12.820]  So how thick are the thieves of truth?
[00:32:13.201 --> 00:32:14.803]  Because if you even tweeted...
[00:32:15.763 --> 00:32:26.188]  Retweeted, talked about tweeting the New York Post's true and real story about Hunter Biden, his ties with energy, right?
[00:32:26.348 --> 00:32:27.048]  Oil companies.
[00:32:27.628 --> 00:32:35.772]  And the millions, potentially billions of dollars that were wrapped up in deals with him sitting on energy boards with no prior work experience to do so.
[00:32:36.432 --> 00:32:39.634]  In an admission on 60 Minutes, he said, I use my dad's name.
[00:32:40.094 --> 00:32:41.514]  So we know the time together.
[00:32:41.554 --> 00:32:47.556]  So we know that they were always compromised and the corporate media with big tech and the whole system suppressed that news.
[00:32:48.356 --> 00:32:49.236]  Kept it from the public.
[00:32:49.276 --> 00:32:50.896]  The FBI did nothing.
[00:32:51.396 --> 00:32:56.197]  The Justice Department did nothing when it's him having sex with his niece on video.
[00:32:57.098 --> 00:33:04.499]  And it's him raping women and underage Chinese girls and snorting cocaine off their rear ends and everything else.
[00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:06.080]  And I refuse to look at it.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.640]  I talked to journalists that went through it.
[00:33:08.544 --> 00:33:10.646]  But I'm not even sure it's legal to even look at that stuff.
[00:33:10.686 --> 00:33:12.127]  So, we never opened it.
[00:33:12.187 --> 00:33:14.148]  We just went to the sites that blurted out and showed it.
[00:33:14.408 --> 00:33:15.249]  It's all confirmed.
[00:33:15.829 --> 00:33:16.490]  And it's unbelievable.
[00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.531]  Because I've never looked at child porn.
[00:33:19.152 --> 00:33:21.073]  By, you know, even an investigation.
[00:33:21.814 --> 00:33:22.594]  I'm not looking at it.
[00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:24.095]  Thank God I've never seen it.
[00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:27.458]  I've never seen all this other stuff that goes on out there either.
[00:33:27.717 --> 00:33:29.717]  And I find myself very blessed and lucky.
[00:33:29.717 --> 00:33:39.717]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:56.117 --> 00:34:04.116]   So, thousands of videos, thousands of photos of him raping women, raping children, raping his family, taking trophy
[00:34:04.116 --> 00:34:06.517]  photos with his niece.
[00:34:06.693 --> 00:34:10.934]  Smoking crack, his rotten teeth, too lazy to even go get the laptop.
[00:34:12.995 --> 00:34:14.635]  And yeah, this is just some of it right here.
[00:34:15.856 --> 00:34:18.937]  Totally compromised by all these foreign governments that have no respect for us.
[00:34:20.517 --> 00:34:35.582]  And then we have Jen Psaki, and all the rest of them, absolutely, totally, and completely censoring all their opposition, and using big tech to surveil everybody in live time.
[00:34:36.783 --> 00:34:40.225]  Look at this headline, America has a free speech problem.
[00:34:40.925 --> 00:34:46.229]  New York Times came out with this two days ago and calls for silencing people like Alex Jones.
[00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:50.251]  That's the press for you in this country today.
[00:34:51.452 --> 00:35:13.612]   While the queens of this corruption, like this individual, Jen Psaki, Run around and do whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want, and just keep force-feeding us lies, and then censoring when we try to stand up and point out they're lying.
[00:35:14.032 --> 00:35:29.100]  Don't expect Twitter to provide restitution for censoring, kicking Americans off the platform for showing totally legit Hunter Biden laptop stories, including the New York Post, because Congress doesn't act against this level of criminal activity.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.370]   Senator Vowles' inquiry into Hunter Biden's Laptop.
[00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:34.230]  Why do you need an inquiry?
[00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.731]  You know what happened!
[00:35:37.051 --> 00:35:38.712]  It's all part of a larger program.
[00:35:38.732 --> 00:35:42.093]  I want to show a short clip from just a few months ago.
[00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:48.395]  Myself and Rob Deuce sat through days of the last big Davos conference.
[00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:56.277]  And Klaus Schwab, who's the Bilderberg Group head and the head spokesman for the Globalist, he's their PR man, he's their hype man.
[00:35:57.304 --> 00:35:58.005]  He's up there.
[00:35:58.025 --> 00:35:59.588]  He doesn't run it, but he's their hype man.
[00:35:59.889 --> 00:36:00.510]  He'll own nothing.
[00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:01.171]  He'll have nothing.
[00:36:01.632 --> 00:36:04.698]  And he's talking about how we're going to set the narrative in the world.
[00:36:05.598 --> 00:36:08.799]  And we're going to execute that narrative on you, and we're going to control the future.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.981]  That's why they want us alone, and dumbed down, and censored.
[00:36:12.341 --> 00:36:29.929]  So they can rain down fraud on us, and rain down lies on us, and rain down, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll eat bugs, and now they're rolling out, I'll show you in a moment, how all we're going to have is bugs under the energy being cut off, while they shut off our energy, and shut off the Russian energy, and shut off everybody else's energy.
[00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.211]  Let me show you a cartoon for TV viewers, before I go to this clip.
[00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.332]  It's on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:36:37.372 --> 00:36:38.653]  For radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[00:36:38.973 --> 00:36:51.462]  It's, again, making fun of a cartoon or making fun of Thanos and the Endgame series, I guess, where they all have the different rings and together they combine their powers.
[00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.904]  I guess Lord of the Rings is another analogy.
[00:36:55.025 --> 00:36:55.806]  Captain Planet.
[00:36:56.866 --> 00:37:01.250]  And it's with our powers combined, you will own nothing and you will be happy.
[00:37:02.355 --> 00:37:06.638]  And it's got Trudeau, the dictator of Canada, saying, I'll shut down your bank account.
[00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:09.720]  Hell, I'll put you in jail for 10 years without a trial.
[00:37:10.061 --> 00:37:11.802]  I'll shut down your social life.
[00:37:12.562 --> 00:37:14.203]  I'll shut down your electric car.
[00:37:16.025 --> 00:37:17.686]  I'll shut down your farmlands.
[00:37:18.406 --> 00:37:22.750]  And of course, it's got Zuckerberg, I'll shut down your media, your social media.
[00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.852]  And all together, Bill Gates, I'll shut down your farmlands.
[00:37:28.595 --> 00:37:30.736]  Biden, I'll destroy your borders, all the rest of it.
[00:37:30.796 --> 00:37:32.998]  Well, with our powers combined, you know what happens.
[00:37:33.298 --> 00:37:42.084]  Well, here is the James Bond villain in real life laying this out, how they're charting the future, and they don't want any narrative that can challenge that.
[00:37:42.104 --> 00:37:51.850]  They've got a neoliberal, sexualize your children, pedophilia, open borders, world government, deep debt, be lazy, smoke weaponized marijuana all day long.
[00:37:54.551 --> 00:38:00.813]  While they're positioning you for the collapse of civilization, in their own words, here's what Dr. Ebel had to say.
[00:38:02.134 --> 00:38:11.777]  What pleasure to be together again, and to design the future.
[00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:31.028]   We are here to develop the great narrative, a story for the future, in order To shape the future, you have first to imagine the future, you have to design the future, and then you have to execute.
[00:38:32.189 --> 00:38:52.710]   Here, I think the next two days, we will look how we imagine, how we decide, how we execute the great narratives, how we define the story, Of our world for the future.
[00:38:53.499 --> 00:39:01.165]  So there's the great reset, the great collapse, the Build Back Better, and the great narrative of the brainwashing as they create the crisis, they offer the solution.
[00:39:01.485 --> 00:39:03.727]  Let's go over a few of the headlines here today.
[00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:13.274]  Brits told to work from home three days a week and ban cars on Sundays to beat Putin's energy crisis, even though they've already engineered the crisis, the value of the currencies.
[00:39:13.294 --> 00:39:21.680]  Now it's all Putin's fault, but don't worry, now they're going to have climate energy lockdowns, which they told you they'd do a few years ago, I told you they would do, and now here they're doing it.
[00:39:23.112 --> 00:39:36.035]  Elite suggests, they don't suggest the UN calls for it, price controls, dystopian travel restrictions to manage soaring energy costs, which again will then destroy the infrastructure and even bring it out and drive up prices even higher later.
[00:39:36.375 --> 00:39:40.856]  Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia supplied the world with one out of every ten barrels of crude.
[00:39:41.256 --> 00:39:52.092]   Now it's not supplying those, and the International Energy Agency of the UN And a consortium of private banks is telling you they're about to cut your energy off even faster.
[00:39:52.653 --> 00:39:58.357]  Globalist Agency calls for energy lockdowns, including banning cars on Sundays, to achieve climate goals.
[00:39:58.957 --> 00:40:03.661]  So what Extinction Rebellion can't get done blocking highways, their big brother will.
[00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:05.102]  Figure this out yet?
[00:40:05.142 --> 00:40:10.286]  I told you the last two years, thousands of times, they're going to cut the energy off, start cutting the power off.
[00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:11.987]  I perseverated over and over again.
[00:40:13.539 --> 00:40:14.881]  Eat lentils instead of meat.
[00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:20.329]  Bloomberg News tells peasants earning less than $300,000 a year how to deal with inflation.
[00:40:20.389 --> 00:40:21.310]  Stop eating meat.
[00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:22.331]  Eat bugs!
[00:40:22.672 --> 00:40:23.153]  Wow!
[00:40:23.733 --> 00:40:25.235]  They all got you ready for it, didn't they?
[00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:29.962]  Tucker Carlson, Americans becoming much poorer due to Washington's driven inflation.
[00:40:30.783 --> 00:40:31.463]  But it's okay.
[00:40:31.943 --> 00:40:41.865]  Mark Ruffalo, Leonardo DiCaprio, he's a big Davos guy, and Ben Stiller and more stars sign letter protesting Canada's gas pipeline.
[00:40:42.145 --> 00:40:44.405]  They've already shut down the Keystone coming into the U.S.
[00:40:44.425 --> 00:40:45.966]  that would cut prices by 30% at least.
[00:40:46.366 --> 00:40:51.507]  Now they want existing pipelines, over 50 years old, all shut down.
[00:40:51.527 --> 00:40:55.788]  And they're going against the Bank of Canada for runs on banks till more energy's shut down.
[00:40:55.968 --> 00:40:56.968]  Because they're liberal!
[00:40:57.148 --> 00:40:57.968]  They care about you.
[00:40:59.845 --> 00:41:03.348]  Continuing, New York Post got its own brand of corruption.
[00:41:04.009 --> 00:41:06.631]  I've talked to a lot of experts, including nutritionists, this week.
[00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:07.451]  This is pure bull.
[00:41:07.772 --> 00:41:08.692]  There's no truth to this.
[00:41:08.712 --> 00:41:09.473]  It's actually the opposite.
[00:41:09.493 --> 00:41:10.954]  You're less fertile if you don't eat meat.
[00:41:11.575 --> 00:41:13.576]  But they're saying if you eat meat, you can't have children.
[00:41:13.917 --> 00:41:17.339]  Oh, young people are having heart attacks and strokes after the COVID shot.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.641]  They claim because they're depressed.
[00:41:19.681 --> 00:41:21.843]  And oh, meat's causing you to be infertile.
[00:41:22.203 --> 00:41:24.745]  The sperm, 96% sterile now in the West.
[00:41:25.206 --> 00:41:27.708]  Oh, it's that meat they don't want you to eat.
[00:41:28.348 --> 00:41:29.469]  Now I see.
[00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.792]  Yes, it makes you become infertile.
[00:41:32.912 --> 00:41:36.895]  Yes, because veganism was obviously a common trend years ago.
[00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:38.616]  That's what everybody had on average.
[00:41:38.656 --> 00:41:40.518]  Six, seven kids 50 years ago.
[00:41:40.578 --> 00:41:41.419]  Now it's less than two.
[00:41:41.799 --> 00:41:42.980]  Yes, it's all that meat.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.324]  You know, they ate more meat 60, 70 years ago than we eat on average now.
[00:41:49.505 --> 00:41:53.909]  Unbelievable levels of B.S., my friends.
[00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:57.251]  I'm not fun about George Soros.
[00:41:58.254 --> 00:41:59.575]  I'm not funded by the New World Order.
[00:41:59.595 --> 00:42:00.496]  I'm funded by you.
[00:42:01.076 --> 00:42:16.667]  And nobody else has built an independent media outlet with tens of millions of views at Bandop Video now every day or so, with millions and millions of people tuned in right here every single day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:17.688 --> 00:42:20.690]  So I just want to encourage everybody out there.
[00:42:22.486 --> 00:42:38.512]  To understand that you built InfoWars and we had to have our own satellites and our own bandwidth and our own servers and we're serving millions and millions and millions and millions of videos a day and tens of millions of web serve pages a day.
[00:42:40.032 --> 00:42:42.933]  And we're not the big global corporations with unlimited money.
[00:42:43.053 --> 00:42:47.154]  We are backed by you and the work we're doing is now more important than it's ever been.
[00:42:47.174 --> 00:42:48.415]  So I want to encourage everybody.
[00:42:50.103 --> 00:42:51.784]  To go to infowarstore.com.
[00:42:52.185 --> 00:43:04.474]  We are running the biggest sale in our history right now, because it turns out we have hundreds of items, a lot of it's t-shirts and things like that that are great shirts, but that I never promoted and I never pushed.

[00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:17.404]  We got a bunch of supplements, we got a bunch of survival gear, we got a lot of great stuff.

[00:43:20.927 --> 00:43:30.630]  That means we're losing money on things like the Save the Frogs flags, or some of the Save the Frogs t-shirts that are already popular, but I haven't promoted in a while, so we've got to move them out.
[00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.931]  And Fizzy Magnesium, sold out for 8 plus months, it's back in stock.

[00:44:01.327 --> 00:44:01.928]  These are nice.
[00:44:02.648 --> 00:44:04.270]  Please take advantage of this and keep us on air.
[00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.289]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:15.250]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:21.490]   The first nation to successfully weaponize and mass-produce deadly pathogens was Great Britain
[00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:28.410]   during the start of World War II, soon followed by the United States, Germany, France,
[00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:30.050]  and Japan.
[00:44:29.795 --> 00:44:36.058]  While many nations mass-produced them, Japan was notorious for deploying biological weapons.
[00:44:36.698 --> 00:44:55.603]  Killing almost a half a million Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns, including the 1940 bombing of Ningbo, China, when Japan's secret bioweapons unit 731 dropped ceramic bombs full of living fleas carrying the bubonic plague.
[00:44:56.963 --> 00:45:10.328]  German pharmaceutical company IG Farben-Bayer conducted fatal human experiments on prisoners and killed over a million people with its cyanide-based Zyklon B. The U.S.
[00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:15.329]  established their own bioweapons program at Fort Detrick, Maryland, in 1942.
[00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:23.512]  And by the end of the war, brand new facilities were completed for mass production of anthrax and other bioweapons.
[00:45:24.352 --> 00:45:34.183]  After the war, the directors of IG Farben were punished at the Nuremberg trials, but the scientists were secretly absorbed into America's bioweapons program.
[00:45:35.464 --> 00:45:44.591]  Japan was planning to attack the city of San Diego, California with weaponized plague, but they surrendered three weeks prior to the scheduled attack.
[00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:57.720]  And while Japanese researchers arrested by Soviet forces were tried for war crimes, those captured by the United States were secretly given immunity in exchange for working with the U.S.
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:58.861]  bioweapons team.
[00:46:00.106 --> 00:46:02.828]  Long after World War II, the U.S.
[00:46:02.888 --> 00:46:09.253]  bioweapons program continued to expand with the help of Japanese and German war criminals.
[00:46:10.074 --> 00:46:12.395]  And in 1969, the U.S.
[00:46:12.435 --> 00:46:27.267]  government officially terminated their offensive biological weapons program, continuing on with a defensive biological weapons program, which was nothing more than a change of language ahead of the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972.
[00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:29.688]  The U.S.
[00:46:29.848 --> 00:46:39.453]  would continue to experiment with and produce deadly pathogens, but now under the guise of defense, and mostly defense against Russia.
[00:46:41.095 --> 00:46:46.699]  Of all the nations involved in bioweapons research, Russia factors in very little.
[00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:47.579]  The U.S.
[00:46:47.599 --> 00:47:04.571]  government claims that the Soviet Union had the biggest bioweapons program in history, but this is based solely on a mysterious 1979 anthrax leak and the lone testimony of Soviet defector Ken Alavek, who has also been absorbed into the U.S.
[00:47:04.631 --> 00:47:05.692]  bioweapons program.
[00:47:06.152 --> 00:47:07.517]  And who has helped the U.S.
[00:47:07.818 --> 00:47:10.970]  surround Russia with dangerous bioweapons labs.
[00:47:12.574 --> 00:47:20.438]  Russia is now releasing confiscated documents of the work that was being conducted in the NATO-backed biolabs they have secured in Ukraine.
[00:47:21.019 --> 00:47:41.490]  These labs were allegedly developing genetically engineered bioweapons to target specific Slavic people, and experimenting with ways of spreading pathogens via bats, ticks, lice, and fleas, like the work Japan's Unit 731 was doing before being secretly brought into the U.S.
[00:47:42.572 --> 00:47:54.035]  Meanwhile, Bill Gates is currently allowed to release hundreds of millions of genetically modified mosquitoes within the United States as some sort of disease control experiment.
[00:47:55.399 --> 00:48:02.283]  You can say what you want about Vladimir Putin and Russia, but they aren't the ones waging war against the people of the West.
[00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:09.106]  That would be the World Economic Forum, the big banks, and their lackeys of the Great Reset agenda.
[00:48:10.086 --> 00:48:10.747]  After the U.S.
[00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:24.294]  government sanctioned all the Russian people, Putin responded by only targeting a few known criminals of the Great Reset cabal, as if sending a message to the Americans that we share the same enemies.
[00:48:25.356 --> 00:48:33.461]  Whereas the global elites are working towards destroying the nation-states, Russia is reinventing the nation-state.
[00:48:34.321 --> 00:48:45.908]  Russia hopes to be the world's biggest producer of organic farming, while the globalists are pushing for genetically modified foods, bugs, and synthetic meat.
[00:48:46.789 --> 00:48:51.372]  The globalists are actively destroying the family, down to the mother's womb.
[00:48:52.265 --> 00:48:57.231]  While Russia seeks to build a society based on family and Christian values.
[00:48:58.012 --> 00:49:05.200]  The Russian government provides fallout shelters for the civilian population to potentially survive a nuclear war.
[00:49:05.901 --> 00:49:06.522]  And the U.S.
[00:49:06.582 --> 00:49:09.225]  government has absolutely nothing.
[00:49:13.155 --> 00:49:17.017]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:49:17.157 --> 00:49:25.041]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:27.887 --> 00:49:36.770]  Well, he's been having a lot of big viral videos the last few years, going up and really telling jokes in front of city councils, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, but also doing some of his rapping.
[00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:42.671]  And one of them got tens of millions of views this week, dealing with the whole situation with Ukraine and Russia.
[00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:44.072]  And of course, he is a pimp.
[00:49:44.092 --> 00:49:44.852]  He owns a blimp.
[00:49:45.292 --> 00:49:48.893]  Alex Stein, comedian, really funny guy, is here with us for the Balance of the Hour.
[00:49:48.913 --> 00:49:54.375]  Then we'll get back to being serious in the third and fourth hour tonight with some big breaking news and more.
[00:49:54.395 --> 00:50:04.271]   But first, Here's one of the previous viral clips where he's in scrubs, not in a business suit, talking about the fraud of the whole COVID police state, which is now all confirmed.
[00:50:08.134 --> 00:50:10.355]  With the real Dr. Fauci, please stand up.
[00:50:10.695 --> 00:50:11.475]  Please stand up.
[00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:12.576]  Please stand up.
[00:50:12.956 --> 00:50:13.756]  Vaccinate your mom.
[00:50:14.036 --> 00:50:14.816]  Vaccinate your dad.
[00:50:15.117 --> 00:50:15.917]  Vaccinate the happy.
[00:50:16.157 --> 00:50:16.957]  Vaccinate the sad.
[00:50:17.197 --> 00:50:18.218]  Vaccinate your babies.
[00:50:18.278 --> 00:50:18.958]  Vaccinate them.
[00:50:19.298 --> 00:50:20.258]  Even if they got rabies.
[00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:21.059]  Vaccinate my life.
[00:50:21.379 --> 00:50:22.139]  Vaccinate my wife.
[00:50:22.479 --> 00:50:24.260]  Vaccinate your DNA.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:26.361]  Vaccine created by the CIA.
[00:50:26.661 --> 00:50:28.201]  Vaccinate your body.
[00:50:28.682 --> 00:50:30.562]  Vaccinate me at the party.
[00:50:30.662 --> 00:50:31.903]  Vaccination free.
[00:50:32.663 --> 00:50:34.344]  Vaccination Freak-A-League!
[00:50:34.505 --> 00:50:36.266]  I want the vaccine in my life!
[00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:38.307]  I want the vaccine for my wife!
[00:50:38.348 --> 00:50:40.489]  I want to vaccinate you all day long!
[00:50:40.749 --> 00:50:42.471]  Vaccinate you while I wear my thong!
[00:50:42.731 --> 00:50:43.652]  Vaccinate me!
[00:50:43.932 --> 00:50:44.652]  Vaccinate who?
[00:50:44.913 --> 00:50:45.673]  Vaccinate she!
[00:50:45.913 --> 00:50:46.614]  Vaccinate her!
[00:50:46.874 --> 00:50:47.615]  Vaccinate them!
[00:50:47.835 --> 00:50:48.916]  Vaccinate my friend!
[00:50:49.436 --> 00:50:51.157]  I want to vaccinate to the end!
[00:50:51.438 --> 00:50:52.298]  Vaccinate me!
[00:50:52.398 --> 00:50:53.199]  Pure L!
[00:50:53.659 --> 00:50:54.260]  I love you!
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.060]  What can I say?
[00:50:55.381 --> 00:50:56.161]  DNA!
[00:50:56.301 --> 00:50:56.822]  I love you!
[00:50:57.222 --> 00:51:00.264]  I've got the pure, I'm feeling pure, so clean.
[00:51:00.544 --> 00:51:02.385]  Got the lights off, cause I'm calling Paul.
[00:51:02.625 --> 00:51:03.885]  Dude, you gotta clean the mic.
[00:51:04.326 --> 00:51:05.967]  You gotta vaccinate.
[00:51:06.347 --> 00:51:08.608]  You gonna get Corona from Mona.
[00:51:08.968 --> 00:51:10.149]  Don't vaccinate.
[00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:11.149]  Don't wait.
[00:51:11.509 --> 00:51:12.410]  Don't hesitate.
[00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:14.491]  You gotta vaccinate in the Lone Star State.
[00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.432]  Vaccination is so great.
[00:51:16.732 --> 00:51:18.393]  Vaccinate me all day long.
[00:51:18.693 --> 00:51:20.314]  Vaccinate your daddy and mom.
[00:51:20.614 --> 00:51:21.935]  Vaccinate my body.
[00:51:22.435 --> 00:51:25.617]  Vaccinate me at the party, a vaccine dream.
[00:51:26.117 --> 00:51:28.739]  I love the vaccine all day long.
[00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:31.461]  I want to vaccinate your mom.
[00:51:31.601 --> 00:51:34.382]  I want to stick a D in your arm.
[00:51:34.602 --> 00:51:36.283]  Oh ma, where are you?
[00:51:36.404 --> 00:51:40.146]  I want to vaccinate you, but you can't hear my song.
[00:51:40.746 --> 00:51:42.428]  Vaccinate me in my thong.
[00:51:42.708 --> 00:51:44.269]  Vaccination right or wrong.
[00:51:44.609 --> 00:51:46.491]  Dr. Fauci, give me that ouchie.
[00:51:46.671 --> 00:51:48.533]  I want it in my body.
[00:51:48.853 --> 00:51:51.075]  Vaccinate me to go to the party.
[00:51:51.495 --> 00:51:52.396]  Omar is back.
[00:51:52.836 --> 00:51:54.357]  Vaccinate me white or black.
[00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:55.518]  Vaccinate you.
[00:51:55.798 --> 00:51:56.459]  Vaccinate who?
[00:51:56.759 --> 00:51:58.360]  Vaccinate you all day long.

[00:52:04.245 --> 00:52:05.886]  I am a vaccination player.
[00:52:06.167 --> 00:52:07.167]  What can I say?
[00:52:08.048 --> 00:52:09.789]  I'm the real Ron Sayer.
[00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:11.210]  Prime time, 99.
[00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.432]  I'm on the grind all the time.
[00:52:13.532 --> 00:52:14.433]  I blow your mind.
[00:52:14.493 --> 00:52:15.313]  I spit the rhyme.
[00:52:15.373 --> 00:52:16.254]  I commit the crime.
[00:52:16.494 --> 00:52:17.635]  I'm always on time, because I'm 99.
[00:52:17.775 --> 00:52:19.176]  I understand.
[00:52:19.396 --> 00:52:20.197]  And I grind and shine.
[00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:22.338]  And I blow your mind one more time.
[00:52:22.598 --> 00:52:23.479]  Vaccinate your mind.
[00:52:23.699 --> 00:52:24.560]  Vaccinate your body.
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.681]  Vaccinate your life if you're vaccination party.
[00:52:26.982 --> 00:52:27.342]  I love y'all.
[00:52:28.032 --> 00:52:29.073]  So great satire.
[00:52:29.093 --> 00:52:30.714]  That got millions and millions of views as well.
[00:52:30.734 --> 00:52:32.215]  People can say it's over-the-top cringe.
[00:52:32.235 --> 00:52:33.256]  I think that's the point.
[00:52:33.336 --> 00:52:34.337]  Alex Stein is here.
[00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:36.379]  He's on YouTube at Conspiracy Castle.
[00:52:36.439 --> 00:52:38.380]  Also he has a Band.Video channel.
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.942]  Conspiracy Castle is very, very popular.
[00:52:40.162 --> 00:52:44.045]  He goes out into serious interviews and down the street gets attacked by liberals and more.
[00:52:44.565 --> 00:52:45.466]  We had you on Friday.
[00:52:45.506 --> 00:52:47.207]  I appreciate you coming down here from Dallas.
[00:52:47.227 --> 00:52:49.529]  Appreciate the crew doing a great job getting here.
[00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:50.050]  Thank you so much.
[00:52:50.677 --> 00:52:51.377]  Come on, Alex.
[00:52:51.437 --> 00:52:52.097]  This is an honor.
[00:52:52.157 --> 00:52:53.498]  For me, this is like the Super Bowl.
[00:52:53.538 --> 00:52:54.818]  I know you do this every single day.
[00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:56.259]  This guy does it six days a week.
[00:52:56.299 --> 00:52:58.560]  He's the hardest working man in show business.
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:53:03.561]  And I know he doesn't call it show business because he's a truth teller, but at the end of the day, Alex, you are the number one comedian out there.
[00:53:03.601 --> 00:53:05.682]  Well, we've got to have some fun sometime.
[00:53:05.702 --> 00:53:07.983]  But seriously, tell us about yourself, because people want to know about you.
[00:53:08.003 --> 00:53:13.064]  I mean, obviously, this last video, 10 million views on Twitter, tens of millions everywhere else.
[00:53:13.444 --> 00:53:15.265]  People really, really liked the last one.
[00:53:15.685 --> 00:53:18.186]  I wanted to play the one before last for folks that haven't seen it.
[00:53:18.706 --> 00:53:22.627]  Well, Alex, everybody knows what's going on right now is problem, reaction, solution.
[00:53:22.807 --> 00:53:27.029]  These companies wanted to sell us a unlimited vaccine schedule.
[00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:29.530]  If you think the fourth booster is going to stop, we're going to be on the fifth booster.
[00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.451]  So what people don't realize is they manufactured a virus.
[00:53:32.491 --> 00:53:34.752]  Now, I'm not saying the virus isn't real, but they overblown it.
[00:53:34.852 --> 00:53:39.393]  Even in the media, they're talking about right now that they gave misinformation on the amount of children.
[00:53:39.413 --> 00:53:40.654]  They had a coding error.
[00:53:40.674 --> 00:53:44.635]  So they said there's more children that died from it than they actually... Yeah, they're covering their ass now.
[00:53:44.935 --> 00:53:45.355]  Exactly.
[00:53:45.415 --> 00:53:47.757]  So what's going on, guys, is they're lying to us.
[00:53:47.817 --> 00:53:50.519]  And Bill Casey, the ex-head of the CIA, said it best.
[00:53:50.559 --> 00:53:55.982]  He said, our disinformation campaign will be complete when everything the public believes is a lie.
[00:53:56.242 --> 00:53:57.343]  And that's what's happening right now.
[00:53:57.383 --> 00:53:58.544]  We do not know what is up.
[00:53:58.584 --> 00:53:59.505]  We do not know what is down.
[00:53:59.525 --> 00:54:00.485]  We do not know what is left.
[00:54:00.605 --> 00:54:01.626]  We do not know what is right.
[00:54:01.966 --> 00:54:05.348]  And that's a purpose deconstruction of our civility.
[00:54:05.368 --> 00:54:05.989]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:54:06.009 --> 00:54:10.712]  They want to cause us to fight each other so we don't actually go and fight the people that are causing all the problems, Alex.
[00:54:11.192 --> 00:54:16.936]  Now it seems to have worked on some people, so they're just getting dumber and dumber, deeper into the lie.
[00:54:17.257 --> 00:54:19.078]  But a lot of people it seems to have backfired on.
[00:54:19.398 --> 00:54:20.599]  Well see Alex, let me tell you something.
[00:54:20.619 --> 00:54:22.360]  When I first got into it, you inspired me.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.423]  I'm not going to sit here on my knee pads and kiss your butt all day, but what I'm saying... You promised not to do that if you came on.
[00:54:26.503 --> 00:54:27.064]  It's boring.
[00:54:27.544 --> 00:54:28.345]  You're a funny guy.
[00:54:28.405 --> 00:54:30.026]  Everybody knows about Alex Jones.
[00:54:30.046 --> 00:54:30.566]  Let's be funny.
[00:54:30.586 --> 00:54:41.013]  What I'm trying to say is, listen, they've been lying to us and people are now realizing this, but when you come and you tell people information, you tell them young people are getting myocarditis at a level that they've never seen in the world, people aren't going to get that.
[00:54:41.053 --> 00:54:42.654]  So what you have to do is you have to use satire.
[00:54:42.674 --> 00:54:48.658]  You have to do cringe stuff in order to make people question the reality that we live in because people don't want to ask questions because everybody's a sheep.
[00:54:48.838 --> 00:54:49.359]  You're right.
[00:54:49.399 --> 00:54:50.820]  You're shaking them out of their...
[00:54:52.561 --> 00:54:57.503]  Of course, and all I'm doing is putting a mirror to the mainstream media, because the mainstream media is bullcrap.
[00:54:57.563 --> 00:55:03.844]  I mean, we know that everything they tell us is a lie, and that's not some sort of hyperbole, that's not a cliche, that is the actual fact.
[00:55:04.084 --> 00:55:13.167]  And you look at any information you were talking about earlier, we knew Hunter Biden's laptop, we knew all the evidence on that laptop, yet when the New York Post tweeted it, if you retweeted it, they cancelled your account.
[00:55:13.467 --> 00:55:17.408]  I got a strike for, you know, just sharing it on my YouTube, the actual story about it.
[00:55:17.688 --> 00:55:20.091]  So they, the technocracy... By the way, it gets worse.
[00:55:20.251 --> 00:55:20.792]  It gets worse.
[00:55:20.872 --> 00:55:31.424]  I've got articles in the Stack the Table show coming up where mainstream news articles, where they have the CDC admitting they overestimated the number of people that got sick or died, those are being censored and blocked.
[00:55:31.524 --> 00:55:36.390]  I mean, it's like Big Pharma is even in control of mainstream media when they try to finally tell the truth.
[00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.651]  Or government officials!
[00:55:37.691 --> 00:55:38.511]  This is insane!
[00:55:38.652 --> 00:55:44.015]  No, Alex, this is the most insane part, and I don't want to get too low-vibrational, but my mom got diagnosed with COVID.
[00:55:44.116 --> 00:55:49.660]  Went to the hospital, went to the ICU, was given remdesivir without our... We told them, do not give my mom... Oh my God, that kills people.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:50.360]  My mom died.
[00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:50.981]  My mom died.
[00:55:51.001 --> 00:55:51.681]  I didn't know that, brother.
[00:55:51.701 --> 00:55:52.742]  My mom died October 25th.
[00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:55.944]  She was murdered at Baylor Hospital, the same hospital that fired Peter McCullough.
[00:55:56.204 --> 00:55:58.466]  I got him on camera saying, do not give my mom remdesivir.
[00:55:58.806 --> 00:56:00.888]  They gave my mom remdesivir, and she died six days later.
[00:56:01.128 --> 00:56:02.049]  So guys, this is the problem.
[00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.909]  Brother, I didn't know that.
[00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:03.870]  Well, tell us about your mom.
[00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.852]  Yeah, well, my mom was the most important person in my life.
[00:56:05.872 --> 00:56:06.312]  Take your time on this.
[00:56:06.332 --> 00:56:06.832]  This is a big deal.
[00:56:06.852 --> 00:56:07.233]  Start over.
[00:56:07.433 --> 00:56:09.395]  Well, I just want to say my mom was my closest friend.
[00:56:09.415 --> 00:56:10.336]  She was my biggest fan.
[00:56:10.496 --> 00:56:11.677]  Loved my content more than anything.
[00:56:11.917 --> 00:56:15.800]  And they murdered my mom because they know the protocols in the hospital is killing people.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:16.121]  Why?
[00:56:16.161 --> 00:56:19.584]  Because they do have to inflate the numbers because not enough people are dying from the actual virus.
[00:56:19.944 --> 00:56:22.665]  So if you guys think that Big Pharma has your back, they don't.
[00:56:22.725 --> 00:56:24.766]  As a matter of fact, they just want to use you like cattle.
[00:56:25.026 --> 00:56:26.127]  They murdered my mom.
[00:56:26.327 --> 00:56:33.370]  The same hospital, Baylor Hospital in Dallas, Texas, that Peter McCullough got fired for saying this is not the proper protocol to treat this virus.
[00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:35.311]  They never gave my mom a chance to live.
[00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:35.991]  They murdered her.
[00:56:36.031 --> 00:56:36.991]  They tied her to a bed.
[00:56:37.031 --> 00:56:43.814]  They put a CPAP machine, basically, a BiPAP machine, excuse me, duct taped her face, basically, and they murdered my mother.
[00:56:43.854 --> 00:56:45.435]  And so this, I'm out for blood.
[00:56:45.455 --> 00:56:47.515]   So listen, I can talk about comedy all day.
[00:56:47.515 --> 00:56:50.195]   I can laugh because I have to laugh or else I'm going to cry.
[00:56:50.195 --> 00:56:52.075]  Every morning I wake up and I cry about my mom.
[00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:56.075]   So the New World Order, the Globus, they murdered the most important person in my life.
[00:56:56.075 --> 00:57:00.915]   So now this is the origin story for me, a guy, to go attack the New World Order.
[00:57:00.915 --> 00:57:05.514]   OK, I was missing a piece because there seemed to be kind of an anger and desperation in
[00:57:05.514 --> 00:57:07.674]  the rap, even though it seems funny, some pain there.
[00:57:07.972 --> 00:57:10.354]  I followed your videos, but I did not see the memorial for your mother.
[00:57:10.634 --> 00:57:12.115]  The great crew will download that video.
[00:57:12.135 --> 00:57:20.141]  We're going to play that memorial you gave for her there at the City Council in Dallas, in Plano, because this is a big, big deal.
[00:57:20.521 --> 00:57:22.062]  And again, for those that don't know, it's 100% fact.
[00:57:23.283 --> 00:57:29.745]  In a bunch of studies, the best Remdesivir did was somebody with COVID was a 7% increase, and that turned out to be a fraud.
[00:57:30.005 --> 00:57:35.566]  But over a 36% chance it would cause total renal failure of the kidneys and other organs.
[00:57:35.606 --> 00:57:41.887]  So this Fauci, just like he used AZT to kill people that had HIV in the 80s and 90s, he did it again.
[00:57:42.027 --> 00:57:43.648]  Fauci literally ordered that.
[00:57:44.208 --> 00:57:45.548]  Fauci literally murdered your mother.
[00:57:45.848 --> 00:57:46.749]  Alex, it's worse than that.
[00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:47.809]  I said no Remdesivir!
[00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:48.529]  No Remdesivir!
[00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:54.754]  They still gave my mom remdesivir because the infectious disease specialist looked me in the face and said, I know more than you.
[00:57:54.854 --> 00:57:55.695]  I know better than you.
[00:57:55.955 --> 00:57:57.456]  And I said, but I asked you not to.
[00:57:57.496 --> 00:57:58.097]  Well, guess what?
[00:57:58.137 --> 00:57:58.817]  I'm not the doctor.
[00:57:58.837 --> 00:57:59.838]  So they murdered my mother.
[00:57:59.878 --> 00:58:01.459]  Now, I just hate sitting here.
[00:58:01.679 --> 00:58:02.340]  How do they feel now?
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.421]  Have you talked to those scumbags?
[00:58:03.501 --> 00:58:04.482]  Oh my gosh, Alex.
[00:58:04.522 --> 00:58:05.763]  They escorted me out with the police.
[00:58:06.884 --> 00:58:08.685]  My mother died when I held her hand.
[00:58:08.725 --> 00:58:09.566]  I watched her turn gray.
[00:58:09.606 --> 00:58:10.206]  She died in my arms.
[00:58:10.607 --> 00:58:14.610]  They had a cop escort me out of Baylor Hospital after my mother died.
[00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.212]  Because they didn't know what I was going to do because they knew how emotional I was.
[00:58:17.232 --> 00:58:17.632]  Well, that's it.
[00:58:17.672 --> 00:58:24.637]  They've turned these into, I mean, Rendez-vous and the ventilators are the new guillotines.
[00:58:25.387 --> 00:58:26.608]  Alex, this is not a joke.
[00:58:26.668 --> 00:58:31.772]  I can joke all day, but the pain is the only reason that I try to joke around, because it hurts so bad.
[00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:35.035]  So, what I'm telling you guys is we are living in a world of lies.
[00:58:35.075 --> 00:58:38.738]  When you got a guy like Alex that's being persecuted so much, it's because he's hitting on target.
[00:58:38.758 --> 00:58:39.579]  It's not accidental.
[00:58:39.799 --> 00:58:44.203]  The reason they have to take him out, because he's one of the only voices out there that is able to say Remdesivir.
[00:58:44.223 --> 00:58:46.865]  If I said this on my channel, my own YouTube channel, they'd give me a strike.
[00:58:47.165 --> 00:58:50.626]  Even a video of my mother, I can get a strike, talking about how my mother was murdered.
[00:58:50.646 --> 00:58:51.307]  So that's where we live.
[00:58:51.547 --> 00:58:55.228]  We live in a world where the technocracy can say, oh, you can kill Vladimir Putin, that's fine.
[00:58:55.468 --> 00:59:03.412]  But if you say that young people are getting myocarditis, if you say that this vaccine is not safe and effective when almonds, even almonds are not safe and effective for everyone.
[00:59:03.452 --> 00:59:04.532]  Alex, stay there.
[00:59:04.592 --> 00:59:05.573]  Stay there, Mr. Stein.
[00:59:09.414 --> 00:59:11.215]  Well, I've been watching Alex Stein stuff.
[00:59:12.247 --> 00:59:16.534]  For a couple years, I've seen his comedy and things and was aware of his work.
[00:59:16.974 --> 00:59:19.198]  I didn't know his mother just died last October.
[00:59:19.218 --> 00:59:20.921]  He's with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:20.941 --> 00:59:27.030]  He's got a lot of these big viral videos where he goes and raps and says things in front of different city councils up in the Dallas area.
[00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:34.276]  But I didn't know that in October of last year, a year after they knew, don't give Randesivir to people.
[00:59:34.336 --> 00:59:35.536]  Of course, Fauci knew from trials.
[00:59:36.257 --> 00:59:41.361]  36% of people you give it to die of kidney failure alone, and then it just gets worse from there.
[00:59:41.381 --> 00:59:44.643]  If you give them morphine or opiates, it makes you stop breathing.
[00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:50.373]  And it turned out they give even stronger drugs in the UK and knew it was to get rid of quote, old people.
[00:59:50.733 --> 00:59:53.635]  So Alex, I was telling you, let's get serious and cover serious news.
[00:59:53.655 --> 00:59:54.376]  You went right into that.
[00:59:54.476 --> 00:59:54.796]  Wow.
[00:59:55.236 --> 00:59:55.957]  I wasn't aware of it.
[00:59:55.997 --> 01:00:02.561]  Now that I noticed, I went and looked on Bandot video and saw a video of you at the city council doing a memorial for her.
[01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:09.406]  We'll get to that next segment, but start at the beginning because I mean, you know, Dr. Peter McCullough, he worked there, he exposed it.
[01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:15.490]  I know he's helping you out with some lawsuit things, but for people that don't know, describe what happened because this is a big deal.
[01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:21.252]  So what happened was, my mom was not feeling well for about two weeks, honestly, but she wasn't feeling that bad.
[01:00:21.312 --> 01:00:24.793]  So I was getting her groceries, and it got to where her breathing was, you know, kind of strained.
[01:00:25.213 --> 01:00:27.193]  She calls 911, they come to her house.
[01:00:27.454 --> 01:00:30.234]  The first night, they said, oh, well, she's stable by the time they got there.
[01:00:30.254 --> 01:00:38.137]  You don't need to go to the hospital because her doctor, she had a telemedicine meeting, and her doctor gave her albuterol for the breathing, right?
[01:00:38.897 --> 01:00:41.598]  So then the second night, my mom faints while she's on the couch.
[01:00:41.658 --> 01:00:43.860]  So she calls 911 before she can even call me.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.080]  She goes straight to the hospital.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.621]  I go to check on her in the morning.
[01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:48.622]  I dial 911 to see if they picked up my mom.
[01:00:49.022 --> 01:00:49.582]  They had.
[01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:51.163]  So then I go to the hospital.
[01:00:51.223 --> 01:00:53.925]  The first day, they had my mom sign a DNR.
[01:00:54.345 --> 01:00:55.986]  We told them, no remdesivir.
[01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:58.067]  Do not give my mom any remdesivir.
[01:00:59.093 --> 01:01:00.934]  They had your mom sign a do not necessitate.
[01:01:00.974 --> 01:01:01.955]  The first time we got there.
[01:01:02.756 --> 01:01:05.918]  As a matter of fact, they had the palliative care come to us the first day.
[01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:06.998]  Why is my mom still breathing?
[01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.399]  Why is my mom talking to me?
[01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:10.921]  They might as well have just had someone in a Grim Reaper outfit.
[01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:11.942]  And see, this is the thing.
[01:01:11.982 --> 01:01:14.263]  My mom had an accident, so my mom was on disability.
[01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.064]  And they knew that.
[01:01:15.124 --> 01:01:17.045]  My mom was on Medicaid, even though she was only 60 years old.
[01:01:18.266 --> 01:01:19.007]  And they knew that.
[01:01:19.047 --> 01:01:21.029]  They know the remdesivir is $1,800 a shot.
[01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:24.792]  And you look at Baylor Hospital, which is the worst hospital in the entire world, so they took advantage of that.
[01:01:24.832 --> 01:01:28.776]  They knew that my mom was an open checkbook for whatever they could prescribe, they gave her.
[01:01:29.116 --> 01:01:30.397]  They did not take proper care.
[01:01:30.437 --> 01:01:33.700]  And so what happened was, this is the same hospital that Peter McCullough was fired from.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:38.384]  Now, I'm working with Peter McCullough's attorney to file a medical malpractice lawsuit, but the problem is...
[01:01:39.205 --> 01:01:41.646]  Now, on the death certificate, it says COVID.
[01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:42.966]  So now I'm fighting an uphill battle.
[01:01:42.986 --> 01:01:45.707]  It doesn't say that she died from the fluids filling up her lungs and her kidneys.
[01:01:46.047 --> 01:01:47.027]  It says she died of COVID.
[01:01:47.047 --> 01:01:48.668]  So, I'm not going to have an easy court case.
[01:01:48.688 --> 01:01:53.429]  This isn't going to be some money payday, even though I have them on tape saying, I told you, don't give my mom remdesivir.
[01:01:53.449 --> 01:01:54.310]  I got this on tape.
[01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:57.271]  It's not like she gave you the power to direct that.
[01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:57.611]  Yes, 100%.
[01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:00.272]  And yet they still gave it to her because... Well, they get $53,000 for anybody they intubate.
[01:02:01.832 --> 01:02:03.154]  Yes, and there's a bounding.
[01:02:03.274 --> 01:02:04.155]  Well, this is what we said.
[01:02:04.195 --> 01:02:05.577]  We walked there, we said no intubation.
[01:02:05.617 --> 01:02:07.099]  No matter what, no intubation.
[01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:11.364]  And when we said that, we said no intubation no matter what, they said, well, here's the DNR.
[01:02:11.404 --> 01:02:12.165]  Your mom's gonna die.
[01:02:12.205 --> 01:02:13.086]  The palliative care came.
[01:02:13.406 --> 01:02:16.410]  All because they wanted the intubator as soon as we got there.
[01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:19.394]  So as a matter of fact, they let my mom die slowly.
[01:02:19.434 --> 01:02:20.195]  It wasn't some sort of...
[01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:24.338]  I almost would have felt better if my mom was intubated and didn't have to feel the pain that she went through.
[01:02:24.358 --> 01:02:26.560]  But I watched my mom struggle and take her last breath.
[01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:28.142]  I mean, I don't even want to cry.
[01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:29.803]  I don't want to get emotional.
[01:02:29.823 --> 01:02:30.984]  Did they give her steroids?
[01:02:31.004 --> 01:02:32.966]  They gave her a cocktail of medicine.
[01:02:33.066 --> 01:02:34.147]  That is what killed her, Alex.
[01:02:34.207 --> 01:02:36.889]  It was the ivermectin.
[01:02:36.909 --> 01:02:39.151]  We asked for ivermectin, and they looked at me like I was some jerk.
[01:02:39.191 --> 01:02:42.534]  By the way, they admit Rendezivir causes massive organ failure.
[01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:43.275]  Of course!
[01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.756]  And listen, this isn't an accident.
[01:02:44.796 --> 01:02:50.960]  Like you said earlier, Dr. Fauci during the AIDS epidemic was giving people AZT, which is some back-ordered cancer drug that didn't help people.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.221]  As a matter of fact, it killed people.
[01:02:52.241 --> 01:02:54.242]  So, listen, this isn't a conspiracy theory.
[01:02:54.362 --> 01:02:55.783]  I wear my tinfoil hat all the time.
[01:02:55.863 --> 01:02:56.824]  I love conspiracies.
[01:02:57.084 --> 01:02:58.705]  But I'm telling you, this is not a conspiracy.
[01:02:58.745 --> 01:02:59.426]  This is a fact.
[01:02:59.486 --> 01:03:02.808]  My mom died because of the globalists, because they have big pharma.
[01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:10.848]   murdered my mom to pump up their numbers to make a vaccine that will never end, a schedule that will never ever end.
[01:03:10.848 --> 01:03:15.309]   And I'm telling you right now, Alex, it's not, I'm not done fighting the globalists.
[01:03:15.309 --> 01:03:19.808]   Like you are fighting globalists. They mess with the wrong guy. I'm just telling you that much, Alex.
[01:03:19.808 --> 01:03:21.808]  Well, they know good and well what they did.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.841]  They planned the whole thing out.
[01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:33.109]  England, a year and a half before, ordered over a hundred times what they normally had of a drug even stronger than morphine that they use in assisted suicide that makes you stop breathing.
[01:03:33.129 --> 01:03:36.271]  And then they gave it to hundreds of thousands of people they killed.
[01:03:36.491 --> 01:03:36.731]  Yes.
[01:03:37.091 --> 01:03:37.872]  And this is the thing, guys.
[01:03:38.172 --> 01:03:39.232]  You're like, oh, what is COVID?
[01:03:39.252 --> 01:03:43.594]  Well, we've had SARS, Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome, MERS, before March of 2020.
[01:03:44.074 --> 01:03:45.635]  So there have been viral diseases.
[01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:49.676]  But what happens is in a normal year, about 60 to 100,000 people die of those viruses.
[01:03:49.977 --> 01:03:51.997]  So that number is about the same this past year.
[01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:53.978]  But in 2020, it was.
[01:03:53.998 --> 01:03:55.579]  Now it exploded because of the vaccines.
[01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:56.139]  Of course.
[01:03:56.219 --> 01:03:58.120]  And guys, listen, you're going to talk about the vaccine.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.041]  Oh, I know somebody got the vaccine totally fine.
[01:04:00.241 --> 01:04:02.862]  But I also know children that got the vaccine have had heart attacks.
[01:04:03.102 --> 01:04:04.863]  The news is trying to cover up, like Alex said.
[01:04:05.503 --> 01:04:07.264]  And you wonder why the hospitals are full.
[01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:10.284]   They said, "Oh, kids are stressed. Oh, that's why they're having heart attacks."
[01:04:10.284 --> 01:04:12.784]   It has nothing to do with a bioweapon that they're putting in your vein.
[01:04:12.784 --> 01:04:15.683]   And it's a never-ending schedule. Just look at Israel. They're on their fourth booster.
[01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:17.683]   Their numbers are going up, and that's what they're going to do now.
[01:04:17.683 --> 01:04:18.683]  They're going to do a fourth booster.
[01:04:18.683 --> 01:04:22.084]   And you never... Exactly. And then you wonder why the hospitals are full.
[01:04:22.084 --> 01:04:24.984]   Every country that takes the shots, the hospitalizations explode.
[01:04:24.984 --> 01:04:29.984]   Well, Alex, these hospitals are in the... They're a business, a capitalist business.
[01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:33.338]  This is not some sort of, oh, go lucky, we're trying to save your life.
[01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.261]  And the doctors that murdered my mom, I wouldn't have brought my cat to them.
[01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:38.983]  I have more respect for my veterinarian than I have for these doctors.
[01:04:39.003 --> 01:04:43.667]  They were right off the medical school boat, whatever you want to call it, and they were a clown, they were a joke.
[01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:56.936]   And that's why my mom had to die, because in any ICU, you're gonna get some doctor that just graduated school that doesn't know his derriere from his elbow, and he's gonna sit there and just listen to whatever the Whatever the proper protocol is, but this protocol is what killed my mother.
[01:04:57.357 --> 01:04:59.617]  Which allows, again, murder through medicine.
[01:04:59.657 --> 01:05:20.045]  The Soviets did it, the Nazis did it, and they all know it's a lie, but they followed orders, and this is the new woke medicine, where they've now committed these massive crimes, they've committed murder, and don't worry, the system now has an army that'll do whatever they want when they release the next bioweapon, which Fauci says is imminent, and he wants more lockdowns after the midterms.
[01:05:20.145 --> 01:05:21.106]  And Alex, I want to say this.
[01:05:21.126 --> 01:05:23.028]  You just played a clip of the dancing nurses.
[01:05:23.088 --> 01:05:25.890]  When I was at the hospital, I was there for hours every single day.
[01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:31.555]  I'd go down, I'd go get, you know, the Chick-fil-A or whatever, and I would see the nurses making TikTok dances.
[01:05:31.875 --> 01:05:36.179]  While my mom is dying, I would see nurses joking around, having a, you know, cow-town!
[01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.940]  That's because they kicked everybody else out!
[01:05:38.661 --> 01:05:44.264]  So they could carry out their operation with no one looking and wouldn't let most areas family in to even see what they were doing.
[01:05:44.504 --> 01:05:46.385]  Well, luckily, you know, you're allowed to go.
[01:05:46.665 --> 01:05:49.507]  Every single day I had to sign a COVID release like I cared.
[01:05:49.807 --> 01:05:51.147]  And they were so mad at me.
[01:05:51.187 --> 01:05:52.848]  They were actually mad that I was in there, Alex.
[01:05:52.888 --> 01:05:56.210]   I'm telling you, they looked at me, they were like, Are you not afraid of getting COVID?
[01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:58.530]  We really don't recommend you being with your mom while she dies.
[01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:03.711]  I'm like, I would be with my mom if she had the most viral disease in the world because I would die for my mother.
[01:06:03.931 --> 01:06:08.353]  Yet they look at me for wanting to be there with my mom like I was some jerk, like I was some psychopath.
[01:06:08.373 --> 01:06:13.454]  And again, it was really also the big hospitals and nursing homes that get $53,000 for every person they kill.
[01:06:13.914 --> 01:06:17.815]  Well, and they got $39,000, I think, just for her being diagnosed with COVID, I believe.
[01:06:17.835 --> 01:06:17.915]  Yeah.
[01:06:18.135 --> 01:06:21.756]  So, listen, we are- I got another $15,000 for putting the tube down the throat.
[01:06:22.036 --> 01:06:25.756]  And guys, they- Another $10,000 when they kill them, so I guess it's $63,000, sorry.
[01:06:25.976 --> 01:06:29.697]  No, they made more money than my mom had in the bank killing her.
[01:06:29.877 --> 01:06:35.978]  And I'm telling you, I would have paid that money a million times over to save her life, but that doesn't matter because those doctors were not interested in saving my mom's life.
[01:06:35.998 --> 01:06:39.019]  Those doctors were just interested in following orders, and that's the problem.
[01:06:39.079 --> 01:06:42.180]  Again, this is all a technocracy beta test, but they're getting ready to roll out even bigger.
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:42.840]  For sure.
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:46.401]  And guys, you know any doctor, all these doctors do are follow orders.
[01:06:46.461 --> 01:06:48.442]  None of these doctors are actually making decisions on their own.
[01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:50.322]  As a matter of fact, when I went to- They might as well be robots.
[01:06:50.342 --> 01:06:55.584]  Well, when I went to CVS to go try to fill it up for ivermectin, if they said that that was for coronavirus, they wouldn't even give it to me!
[01:06:55.784 --> 01:06:57.164]  They wouldn't even give me ivermectin!
[01:06:57.184 --> 01:07:00.285]  So listen, they can control- The left is for assisted suicide.
[01:07:00.885 --> 01:07:06.951]  And for cutting little boys' genitals off, but if you want to give them a pill that they admit is safe, but they claim doesn't work, you can't have it.
[01:07:07.151 --> 01:07:15.278]  Because they're tyrants, because they're control freaks, because they're murderers, because they're corporate front people posing as liberals who are actually a bunch of dangerous pedophiles.
[01:07:15.518 --> 01:07:16.839]  Alex, just look at Nigeria.
[01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:19.261]  Nigeria has the lowest numbers of COVID in the world.
[01:07:19.522 --> 01:07:22.725]  They prescribe ivermectin like crazy because they have parasites in their water.
[01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:23.085]  India.
[01:07:24.426 --> 01:07:29.328]  Listen, and those numbers of COVID are all the way down, so I'm not saying that Ivermectin is a cure-all, but it would help.
[01:07:29.568 --> 01:07:32.350]  These people are not trying to help, they're trying to- And Alex, here's the deal though.
[01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.932]  They're just pausing here because they knew we woke up, we're about to hit the crest of awakening.
[01:07:37.293 --> 01:07:39.013]  They're bringing this all back, that's the plan.
[01:07:39.274 --> 01:07:42.015]  So we gotta keep hammering these people and call for justice.
[01:07:42.355 --> 01:07:46.137]  Bill Gates, Peter Daszak, Fauci, they all need to go to prison.
[01:07:46.177 --> 01:07:51.720]  We have them red-handed, they've been caught, they cooked the weapon up, they released it, and then the injection is even worse.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:58.740]  It's the same thing.
[01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:03.900]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:06.540]  [Music]
[01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:12.950]  I lost family and friends from the bioweapon that was created by Fauci and the globalist Bill Gates on record.
[01:08:13.851 --> 01:08:17.211]  Then they rolled their weapon out on purpose to remove Trump from office.
[01:08:17.231 --> 01:08:19.252]  He, of course, fell for their trick to roll out the vaccine.
[01:08:19.592 --> 01:08:24.233]  Who could imagine they were going to roll out the same thing that's in the virus, spike protein, in a shot?
[01:08:24.353 --> 01:08:26.854]  But they did, and now we know the carnage.
[01:08:27.802 --> 01:08:28.702]  And what's happened since then?
[01:08:28.722 --> 01:08:30.623]  I've got some big news on that front.
[01:08:30.643 --> 01:08:45.426]  I was already planning to get into with Alex Stein here, who is already a well-known talk show host and comedian, but then I didn't know that his mother had actually died last October, despite the fact that he was informed, knew what was going on, and had the power of attorney or, you know, power over life.
[01:08:46.087 --> 01:08:48.627]  With that, they just overrid and did what they wanted.
[01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:50.588]  And I've talked to a lot of medical doctors.
[01:08:50.628 --> 01:08:52.028]  You know, my dad's a physician, retired.
[01:08:52.048 --> 01:08:55.109]  And they just say, this is the tyranny of the new corporate medicine.
[01:08:55.689 --> 01:09:01.345]  Where the bioethics boards, with the big companies that own the hospitals, they make the decision.
[01:09:02.483 --> 01:09:03.804]  Alex Stein is here with us.
[01:09:04.565 --> 01:09:05.526]  We actually have a clip.
[01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:08.328]  People, you just tell the folks the whole name of the video.
[01:09:08.348 --> 01:09:10.310]  They want to find it on your YouTube or at Bandot Video.
[01:09:10.571 --> 01:09:11.331]  They can see the whole thing.
[01:09:11.351 --> 01:09:21.340]  But you actually have video of you telling them, no Randezivir, because this was a year after it had already killed a bunch of people around the world and was well known in a lot of hospitals, but we're not giving it anymore.
[01:09:21.961 --> 01:09:22.882]  This is just crazy.
[01:09:22.902 --> 01:09:26.285]  But these guys took their directive, I guess, directly from Fauci.
[01:09:26.665 --> 01:09:27.586]  Damn them to hell.
[01:09:27.766 --> 01:09:28.347]  Tell us what happened.
[01:09:28.647 --> 01:09:36.795]  So in this clip, the first clip we're going to play, I talk about how I told the doctors no remdesivir and you're going to see the palliative care doctor and off screen you're going to see Dr. Snow.
[01:09:36.835 --> 01:09:39.018]  That's the one that okayed the medicine for my mother.
[01:09:39.058 --> 01:09:41.220]  So this clip, this is my mom dying right here.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:47.106]  This is not, you know, I like to joke around, I like to laugh, but I'm telling you the only reason why is because I'm in so much pain.
[01:09:47.146 --> 01:09:51.190]  It's the only thing that makes it, you know, even livable because my life is actually a living nightmare.
[01:09:52.071 --> 01:09:55.654]  In this video, the last 20 seconds, I tell them, no remdesivir.
[01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:59.458]  And they just look at me like I'm some sort of conspiracy tinfoil hat idiot.
[01:09:59.938 --> 01:10:04.963]  And I'm telling you... Which on record fills up the body with fluid because the kidneys fail.
[01:10:05.844 --> 01:10:06.184]  Oh, 100%.
[01:10:06.565 --> 01:10:09.988]  And her health declined rapidly after they gave her the remdesivir.
[01:10:10.028 --> 01:10:12.510]  So, if you have the clip, the last 20 seconds... Gotta roll it.
[01:10:14.733 --> 01:10:18.656]  Well I just don't understand why I said I didn't want her on remdesivir when you guys put her on remdesivir.
[01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:22.939]  That was the infectious disease doctors and she had already been on that and completed the course.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:27.343]  I'm talking about before the first day we were in here I said we didn't want to do that and you guys did that anyway.
[01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:29.264]  So if you look at the studies right now.
[01:10:29.304 --> 01:10:33.528]  Listen I don't care about the studies I asked you not to do something and you did it okay that's the problem.
[01:10:34.161 --> 01:10:35.021]  That's what they say to me.
[01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:36.842]  They said, oh, well, the study told us to do it.
[01:10:37.443 --> 01:10:39.224]  Guys, they murdered my mother.
[01:10:39.264 --> 01:10:40.444]  I don't care what you say.
[01:10:40.524 --> 01:10:41.725]  Anybody can look me in the face.
[01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:45.907]  I watched my mom get murdered, and I told them, do not give her... Look, it's on record, Fauci does.
[01:10:45.927 --> 01:10:47.007]  This is how he kills people.
[01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:48.468]  He does it through the medical system.
[01:10:48.508 --> 01:10:51.169]  He commits the same crime different ways over and over again.
[01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.690]  It's classic.
[01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:52.510]  We have all the documents.
[01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:53.571]  Nuremberg, too.
[01:10:53.631 --> 01:10:57.152]  They should all be charged and brought up on crimes against humanity.
[01:10:57.433 --> 01:10:57.693]  Charges.
[01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:00.054]  Now, describe this city council.
[01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:03.276]  Dallas City Council, this is not you doing a rap video.
[01:11:04.036 --> 01:11:07.598]  This is you, right after she's died, giving a memorial.
[01:11:07.918 --> 01:11:08.518]  Tell us about this.
[01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:09.099]  We'll go to the clip.
[01:11:09.379 --> 01:11:14.041]  Well, this is just me, you know, talking about how my mom was murdered, trying to bring awareness to it.
[01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.523]  So this wasn't me being a goofball or clown like normal.
[01:11:17.203 --> 01:11:18.204]  This is the problem though, Alex.
[01:11:18.244 --> 01:11:22.726]  I go up there and I spill my heart and soul out there, and they look at me like I'm some freak.
[01:11:22.886 --> 01:11:24.647]  That's the sad problem with these politicians.
[01:11:24.667 --> 01:11:28.088]  That's why I have to act goofy, because these are what I call non-playable characters.
[01:11:28.108 --> 01:11:30.670]  That's video game terminology that they're not going to interact with us.
[01:11:30.710 --> 01:11:32.971]  These politicians, once we elect them, they think they're better than us.
[01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:34.131]  Well, they're like these new doctors.
[01:11:34.351 --> 01:11:42.635]  It's all about not caring, not having the facts, not having empathy, and carrying out their orders from Klaus Schwab that come down the directive, just like Trudeau, just like all of them.
[01:11:42.655 --> 01:11:43.676]  Let's go ahead and roll this tape.
[01:11:47.469 --> 01:11:48.790]  Dallas City Council, Memorial Day.
[01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:49.591]  Hello.
[01:11:49.811 --> 01:12:03.042]  Usually I come here to joke around or say something, you know, to highlight the absurdity and hypocrisy of our elected officials, but today is not that day because my mom was murdered on October 25th at Baylor Hospital.
[01:12:03.062 --> 01:12:06.445]  She was given remdesivir without our authority.
[01:12:07.066 --> 01:12:09.688]  We told them specifically not to give her remdesivir.
[01:12:10.128 --> 01:12:12.851]  Five days later, all of my mom's organs shut down.
[01:12:13.271 --> 01:12:14.252]  We showed them the studies.
[01:12:14.692 --> 01:12:18.095]  Over 30% of the people that were given remdesivir in the studies died.
[01:12:18.455 --> 01:12:22.298]  We told the doctor, the infectious disease specialist, do not give my mom remdesivir.
[01:12:22.598 --> 01:12:23.239]  Guess what they did?
[01:12:23.259 --> 01:12:25.701]  They gave her a five-day cycle and my mom is dead.
[01:12:26.221 --> 01:12:26.781]  She's dead.
[01:12:26.821 --> 01:12:36.549]  She died at Baylor Hospital tied to a bed with a ventilator taped to her face with her hands tied to the bed because she was ripping it off.
[01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:47.444]  What they did to my mom by slowly torturing her to death will not happen to me because I'm not going to go out like that, first of all, and nobody should go out like that.
[01:12:47.524 --> 01:12:55.113]  Every single person on this council should hope and pray that you do not receive the same care that my mom received at Baylor Hospital when she was murdered.
[01:12:55.453 --> 01:13:04.576]  You guys better hope and pray that when you are in a circumstance, when you need life-saving treatment, and you tell the doctor to do something, you better go to a hospital where they will listen to you.
[01:13:04.596 --> 01:13:07.977]  Because at Baylor Hospital, they wanted to ventilate my mom as soon as she got there.
[01:13:07.997 --> 01:13:11.078]  While she was walking and talking in the hospital, they wanted to ventilate her.
[01:13:11.338 --> 01:13:15.819]  Because they get a $39,000 federal funding every time somebody is on a ventilator.
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.120]  And now my mom is dead, given an experimental drug.
[01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:23.202]  And so now I have to live with this pain every single day for the rest of my life.
[01:13:24.144 --> 01:13:26.046]  So I wrote a little poem to honor my mom.
[01:13:26.886 --> 01:13:28.608]  I miss my mother more than I ever thought.
[01:13:28.788 --> 01:13:30.509]  I've been to hell, and boy, it's hot.
[01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:35.574]  Watching my mom die in front of my face, it was more painful than a bottle of mace.
[01:13:36.334 --> 01:13:41.719]  Sometimes you forget the world is so bad until you go to Baylor Hospital and die before your son's dad.
[01:13:42.379 --> 01:13:44.521]  I will never recover from this pain.
[01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:47.584]  The memory of my mom dying is tattooed in my brain.
[01:13:48.264 --> 01:13:51.067]  I don't wish this hurt on any mortal soul.
[01:13:52.182 --> 01:13:54.786]  The feeling is empty, like a shattered bowl.
[01:13:55.928 --> 01:13:57.911]  I lost my number one fan on the earth.
[01:13:58.492 --> 01:14:00.475]  Without my mother, I feel little worth.
[01:14:01.176 --> 01:14:03.680]  Please don't let my mom die in worthless vain.
[01:14:04.341 --> 01:14:07.005]  Baylor Hospital killed her with a side of extra pain.
[01:14:08.325 --> 01:14:11.149]  My story is not unique in the slightest.
[01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:14.473]  So hug your mom and dad while they're still the brightest.
[01:14:15.013 --> 01:14:21.121]  Because my mom is dead and my heart is broken, you can lose a loved one before you finish that cig that you're smoking.
[01:14:21.581 --> 01:14:26.567]  And I'm telling you guys, we told these doctors at Baylor Hospital, do not give my mom remdesivir.
[01:14:27.168 --> 01:14:31.834]  Five days later, tied to a bed, all of her organs failed, and she died in my arm.
[01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.336]  I watched my mom turn gray.
[01:14:33.656 --> 01:14:49.797]   And now that I've been to hell and back, my mom will not die in vain, and the people at Baylor Hospital, they will know what they did was wrong, because I will bring and highlight The travesty of the murder of Kelly Fahey Stein by the hands of Baylor Hospital in Dallas, Texas.
[01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:51.479]  So my mom will not die in vain.
[01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:57.026]  RIP mom, I miss you more than anything in this entire world and you shouldn't have had to die at 60 years old.
[01:14:57.767 --> 01:14:58.147]  Thank you.
[01:14:59.349 --> 01:14:59.810]  Thank you.
[01:15:00.811 --> 01:15:01.512]  Thomas Lambert.
[01:15:02.856 --> 01:15:05.558]  All right, let me lay this out for people, and obviously you comment about your mother.
[01:15:06.178 --> 01:15:09.480]  It's not like Alex Stein is just pissed off because his mom died.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.361]  We know how they made the virus.
[01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:28.572]  We have the emails, the documents, the funding, how they prepared to release it, to quote, blow up the old system and bring in mRNA gene therapy, gene editing takeover, and studying the spike protein, studying how the vaccine would actually give you permanent infections of long COVID.
[01:15:28.993 --> 01:15:29.553]  They did it all.
[01:15:30.919 --> 01:15:34.903]  Then they rolled out the rendezvous that all the world killed people, so most places stopped it in a few months.
[01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:45.312]  Even New York, by October last year when they killed your mother, had to stop ventilating people when they were standing up because ventilating somebody with COVID kills them.
[01:15:45.693 --> 01:15:51.258]  So Baylor knew that's what's incredible and was doing stuff late last year when almost everybody else had quit.
[01:15:52.677 --> 01:15:53.318]  Well, that's a fact.
[01:15:53.338 --> 01:15:54.539]  I mean, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:15:54.559 --> 01:15:55.860]  My mom will not die in vain.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.640]  get the maximum amount of money.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:01.399]   And let me tell you, you think you want to bring judgment on them?
[01:16:01.399 --> 01:16:03.359]  God will bring judgment on all these people.
[01:16:03.359 --> 01:16:06.199]   Whatever they did to you and your mother is going to be done to them sevenfold by God,
[01:16:06.199 --> 01:16:07.199]  you can guarantee it.
[01:16:07.199 --> 01:16:08.199]  Well, that's a fact.
[01:16:08.199 --> 01:16:09.199]  I mean, I'm going to tell you something.
[01:16:09.199 --> 01:16:10.400]  My mom will not die in vain.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.960]   I will never stop fighting these evil people that did this to my mom because nobody else
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.960]  that I know or love is going to be murdered like that.
[01:16:16.941 --> 01:16:21.906]  Now, I'm telling you, some stuff is out of my control, even though I was at the hospital, because they will look you in your face and lie to you.
[01:16:22.066 --> 01:16:27.711]  These same people that you're supposed to trust, these doctors, will say, oh, we're not going to do that, and they do it behind your back, and they say that they know better.
[01:16:27.891 --> 01:16:30.793]  They'll tell you they're not going to vaccinate your baby with some deadly shot and do it anyways.
[01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:32.094]  Because they're criminals.
[01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:44.784]  I mean, if you look at the VAX schedule, they even say the MMR vaccine, if they didn't give it at a certain time, it wouldn't cause autism, yet they still recommend to give it at such an early age, where the numbers, they say, oh, correlation doesn't mean causation!
[01:16:45.044 --> 01:16:54.431]  That's how evil these people are, and it's the same people that will lie to you on the news, so you cannot ever, ever know what the truth is, because like I said at the beginning of this interview, Bill Casey, the head of the CIA, said...
[01:16:55.271 --> 01:16:57.152]  The biggest disinformation campaign.
[01:16:57.192 --> 01:17:00.833]  You'll know that we're winning this campaign when everything everybody believes is a lie.
[01:17:00.873 --> 01:17:01.833]  And that's what's going on now.
[01:17:01.933 --> 01:17:04.254]  Even the doctors know this is bullcrap, but they do it.
[01:17:04.594 --> 01:17:07.495]  And they're following orders, killing people on purpose, Alex.
[01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:10.016]  We started winning in the last few months around the world.
[01:17:10.456 --> 01:17:11.337]  Our numbers were exploding.
[01:17:11.357 --> 01:17:12.637]  They were losing more whistleblowers.
[01:17:12.897 --> 01:17:16.499]  So now they're acting like they're backing off their medical tyranny, hoping we fall asleep.
[01:17:16.539 --> 01:17:19.099]  Now, we know you're never going to go away until we get rid of you.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.340]  We know you're going to keep coming back.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:26.525]  So we're on you, and we're not going to stop exposing the medical tyranny, and we're going to bring Bill Gates and the globalists to justice.
[01:17:26.785 --> 01:17:30.128]  Yeah, and it can't happen fast enough, but that's what's happening now, guys.
[01:17:30.188 --> 01:17:31.369]  It's all wag the dog.
[01:17:31.389 --> 01:17:33.230]  They're trying to distract us, because people are waking up.
[01:17:33.270 --> 01:17:34.391]  People are tired of the mask.
[01:17:34.491 --> 01:17:35.332]  All right, stay there.
[01:17:35.352 --> 01:17:36.713]  The other side of Alex Stein.
[01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:38.355]  On the other side, a ton of news.
[01:17:38.415 --> 01:17:40.336]  I'm hosting third and fourth hour as well.
[01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:41.456]  Huge.
[01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:42.456]  [music]
[01:17:42.456 --> 01:18:00.456]   Well, Alex Stein is here, ladies and gentlemen, and he's going to be leaving us soon and going
[01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:04.016]  I want to invite him to come down sometime and co-host with me.
[01:18:05.151 --> 01:18:06.572]  And his story is just incredible.
[01:18:06.592 --> 01:18:08.554]  His mother was killed.
[01:18:09.535 --> 01:18:10.456]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:18:10.496 --> 01:18:11.457]  Byron Dezavir.
[01:18:11.497 --> 01:18:14.940]  And that is a default position of these people.
[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:18.883]  But it's only going to be education that stops them next time.
[01:18:18.943 --> 01:18:21.205]  Because they've said they're going to release a new virus.
[01:18:21.605 --> 01:18:23.067]  They've said more variants are coming.
[01:18:23.467 --> 01:18:28.712]  And until Fauci and all of them go to prison for what they've done, they're going to keep doing it over and over and over again.
[01:18:28.732 --> 01:18:31.134]   If you're a new listener, you're like, Wow, this is incredible.
[01:18:31.234 --> 01:18:39.181]  Folks, we've done endless shows with top scientists with all the documents, how they made it, how they created it, how they went to the Pentagon and said, we want to release this in China.
[01:18:39.201 --> 01:18:40.102]  And they said, are you crazy?
[01:18:40.442 --> 01:18:41.223]  That'll start a war.
[01:18:41.503 --> 01:18:44.946]  So Peter Daszak and them did it on their own to take over the planet.
[01:18:45.026 --> 01:18:48.089]  And they own the patents to then treat the very thing they released.
[01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:52.413]  The company helped be set up by Bill Gates and the rest of it.
[01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:55.916]  Moderna had the COVID-19 and the spike protein in 2016.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.042]  This is just incredible.
[01:18:59.102 --> 01:19:02.287]  Yeah, there's video of him admitting it all before COVID was released.
[01:19:02.828 --> 01:19:04.651]  Or right when it was being released, before it was announced.
[01:19:04.912 --> 01:19:06.234]  To cover their ass.
[01:19:06.956 --> 01:19:08.956]  Alex Stein, where do you see all this going?
[01:19:08.956 --> 01:19:09.956]  Well, let me tell you something.
[01:19:09.956 --> 01:19:11.795]  We're under constant trauma-based mind control.
[01:19:11.795 --> 01:19:14.435]   They want to keep people in that fight or flight state of mind
[01:19:14.435 --> 01:19:17.275]   so that they can control them, so you can't see two inches in front of your face.
[01:19:17.275 --> 01:19:19.355]  But like you said, people are waking up.
[01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:24.195]   But sadly, what they're going to do now, what just happened, is a beta program for the climate change lockdowns,
[01:19:24.195 --> 01:19:25.916]  for future lockdowns, or future variants.
[01:19:25.916 --> 01:19:29.076]   So if you don't stand up and do something and be civilly disobedient--
[01:19:29.076 --> 01:19:30.835]  I'm not saying be dumb disobedient.
[01:19:30.835 --> 01:19:33.154]  Do it with civility, because that's what they can't stop.
[01:19:33.154 --> 01:19:37.596]   If you can be civilly disobedient, then we can actually win this culture war, this whatever--
[01:19:37.596 --> 01:19:38.115]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:38.115 --> 01:19:42.275]   We won round two, but-- and I don't mean to interrupt you, but I keep meaning to make this point.
[01:19:43.001 --> 01:19:44.362]  Keep going, I'm going to make the point in a moment.
[01:19:44.382 --> 01:19:47.785]  Well, I'm just saying, guys, you have to be civilly disobedient.
[01:19:47.805 --> 01:19:49.907]  We have to do something because it's not going to stop.
[01:19:49.947 --> 01:19:51.168]  This is just the beta test.
[01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:52.249]  This is just the start.
[01:19:52.529 --> 01:19:53.450]  And they've had viruses.
[01:19:53.470 --> 01:20:00.035]  They've been wanting to do this with SARS, with MERS, and they just, they had to do it this time because they had to steal an election from Trump with mail-in ballots.
[01:20:00.055 --> 01:20:05.079]  So they had to pump up this virus and then they had to kill people in order to get us used to the lockdown lifestyle.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.182]  So when they do it again, people run to it because there's people that love wearing their masks.
[01:20:08.362 --> 01:20:12.084]  There are people that love the lockdown because their life is such crap, they want to bring people down with them.
[01:20:12.405 --> 01:20:14.386]  Misery loves company, and that's what's happening right now.
[01:20:14.626 --> 01:20:18.829]  They keep us all in a state of constant trauma-based mind control so that we bring people down with us.
[01:20:19.149 --> 01:20:20.270]  And that's what's happening, Alex.
[01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:22.051]  Keep landing on them, brother.
[01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.472]  Well, I'm not going to stop.
[01:20:23.512 --> 01:20:24.732]  I'm not going to stop till the day I die.
[01:20:24.752 --> 01:20:26.033]  And they're going to have to kill me to stop.
[01:20:26.073 --> 01:20:27.914]  And I know they're going to try to take me out at one point.
[01:20:27.934 --> 01:20:29.956]  They're going to try to shadow ban me or whatever they can.
[01:20:29.976 --> 01:20:33.498]  But I'm telling you, I am not going to stop fighting for the truth until the day I die.
[01:20:33.538 --> 01:20:36.600]  Because we live under constant lies, and people need to understand that.
[01:20:37.859 --> 01:20:38.500]  Absolutely.
[01:20:38.540 --> 01:20:48.252]  You know, I think you should, I think everybody should do what you do and go to city halls, county commissions, school boards, and just speak about whatever issues you want and the people should be heard.
[01:20:48.612 --> 01:20:52.136]  And just through those venues, all of it basically goes viral.
[01:20:52.376 --> 01:21:01.160]   I mean, even if just the school board or the city council hears you and those watching on local cable see you, You're reaching thousands, but when it gets picked up, you're reaching tens of millions.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:03.761]  I mean, your latest video has got to have 30 million views.
[01:21:03.982 --> 01:21:06.503]  Oh yeah, I mean, it's been shared by every single big account, too.
[01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:08.344]  You know, even the stupid Young Turks fell for it.
[01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:09.165]  I don't know if you saw that.
[01:21:09.185 --> 01:21:11.786]  They played it, and they said it was their favorite video ever.
[01:21:11.806 --> 01:21:12.587]  They're such imbeciles.
[01:21:12.627 --> 01:21:14.248]  They believe that I- They didn't get the satire.
[01:21:14.288 --> 01:21:15.648]  They didn't get- that's how dumb they are.
[01:21:15.668 --> 01:21:18.170]  Actually, they're so evil, they thought they could trick their viewers.
[01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:20.631]  I think you underestimate me.
[01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:25.573]  They've taken videos of me with one and two second clips and totally edited them together to say the opposite.
[01:21:25.853 --> 01:21:26.774]  They are really evil.
[01:21:26.794 --> 01:21:28.714]  They're fully funded by George Soros.
[01:21:28.795 --> 01:21:29.475]  No, they're the worst.
[01:21:29.535 --> 01:21:34.457]  And guys, you don't realize this George Soros guy that we're talking about, he's putting all these crooked district attorneys in all these cities.
[01:21:34.477 --> 01:21:37.518]  They're poisoning us from the inside, from the very small local government.
[01:21:37.538 --> 01:21:38.739]  So they can then medically kill us.
[01:21:39.139 --> 01:21:43.401]  He also had them do the strains to weaponize marijuana, where it causes brain damage and schizophrenia.
[01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:44.741]  Yeah, but forget about the marijuana.
[01:21:44.761 --> 01:21:48.482]  Marijuana's terrible, but they have Chinese fentanyl coming through the border that are murdering my friends.
[01:21:48.522 --> 01:21:50.122]  I've had friends die of a drug overdose.
[01:21:50.142 --> 01:21:53.103]  They thought they were taking Vicodin, and that was a pressed pill with fentanyl.
[01:21:53.123 --> 01:21:55.963]  So it's not some accident that this Chinese fentanyl is killing everybody.
[01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:56.744]  They like it.
[01:21:56.764 --> 01:21:57.844]  They want you to be sad.
[01:21:57.884 --> 01:21:59.184]  They want your child to die.
[01:21:59.284 --> 01:22:00.384]  And that is not hyperbole.
[01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:04.085]  They want to murder you, make you feel guilty about it, so they can control you even more.
[01:22:04.265 --> 01:22:12.209]   And I want to be clear, I've always been for drug decriminalization, but the marijuana now It's not the marijuana it was even 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:19.477]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I smoked some pot with Mike Tyson and was stoned for two days, okay?
[01:22:20.037 --> 01:22:21.298]  And that interview is coming out soon.
[01:22:21.418 --> 01:22:23.681]  And Mike's a good guy and I don't think you should put people in prison for it.
[01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:30.448]  The whole point is that this is extremely strong and people that don't have any drive, it'll destroy them.
[01:22:30.828 --> 01:22:32.329]  Yeah, but Alex, it's not just the drugs.
[01:22:32.369 --> 01:22:34.251]  I mean, there's a reason there's a liquor store in every corner.
[01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:39.736]  They want you dumb, drunk, high and stoned on purpose so that you cannot actually go after the people that are causing it.
[01:22:39.756 --> 01:22:40.337]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[01:22:40.357 --> 01:22:40.837]  There's no doubt.
[01:22:40.897 --> 01:22:41.678]  Alcohol's even worse.
[01:22:41.718 --> 01:22:42.058]  You're right.
[01:22:42.178 --> 01:22:44.600]  And I mean, listen, I'm not some, you know, teetotaler.
[01:22:44.661 --> 01:22:45.701]  Everybody, life is short.
[01:22:45.742 --> 01:22:46.302]  Have some fun.
[01:22:46.322 --> 01:22:52.227]  But at the same time, do not let these people, these evil people, influence you to make decisions that are going to kill you at the end of the day.
[01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:52.708]  Well, yeah.
[01:22:52.748 --> 01:22:55.690]  I mean, they're setting up a medical, biomedical surveillance tyranny.
[01:22:56.391 --> 01:23:01.473]  Bring in a world government on it, admitting that, and now getting ready for new lockdowns and new attacks.
[01:23:01.513 --> 01:23:02.993]  Other parts of the world are still locked down.
[01:23:03.473 --> 01:23:04.914]  We have got to say no to this.
[01:23:04.954 --> 01:23:09.535]  We've got to not just let them squeeze us and then they turn loose for a minute and then squeeze us even tighter.
[01:23:09.895 --> 01:23:11.256]  I've told everybody that's the plan.
[01:23:11.576 --> 01:23:13.816]  They have psychological graphs explaining how they're doing it.
[01:23:14.116 --> 01:23:15.877]  We've got to come together and say no.
[01:23:15.977 --> 01:23:16.737]  I mean, here they are.
[01:23:16.757 --> 01:23:22.459]  They're now announcing climate lockdowns because of Putin, because there's not enough energy, as they turn off the energy everywhere.
[01:23:22.719 --> 01:23:25.441]  Well, Alex, look at every CVS is adding a doctor there.
[01:23:25.481 --> 01:23:28.383]  What's going to happen is in the very near future, you're not even going to go to a doctor.
[01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:29.544]  It's going to be all telemedicine.
[01:23:29.584 --> 01:23:31.345]  And like you've said before... All shots and drugs.
[01:23:31.385 --> 01:23:33.106]  Yeah, you're going to be talking to a doctor in New York.
[01:23:33.126 --> 01:23:37.169]  You're going to say, and they're going to say, oh, you're getting a team of doctors at the same time where you're doing it over Skype.
[01:23:37.369 --> 01:23:40.091]  And these doctors are going to prescribe something that's literally going to kill you.
[01:23:40.131 --> 01:23:45.295]  So they are actually disconnecting us from actually trying to get... They're just, they're just pill dispensers for big pharma.
[01:23:45.695 --> 01:23:49.480]  100%!
[01:23:45.715 --> 01:23:49.480]  And if you want the right pill, ivermectin, you can't even have it!
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:51.503]  So the pills they give you are crap!
[01:23:51.603 --> 01:23:53.005]  They want you dead!
[01:23:53.205 --> 01:23:54.206]  I'm not saying that!
[01:23:54.246 --> 01:23:55.147]  That's not cliche!
[01:23:56.115 --> 01:23:57.176]  Absolutely, my friend.
[01:23:57.256 --> 01:23:58.836]  I mean, they're depopulationists.
[01:23:58.896 --> 01:24:00.237]  Bill Gates and all of them.
[01:24:00.457 --> 01:24:02.018]  Peter Daszak says he wants to depopulate.
[01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:04.019]  And then he runs a deadly bio lab.
[01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.239]  I mean, it's like 12 monkeys.
[01:24:05.319 --> 01:24:06.700]  Well, look at William Gates Sr.
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:07.720]  That's Bill Gates' dad.
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:09.761]  Started Planned Parenthood with Margaret Sanger, guys.
[01:24:09.801 --> 01:24:12.562]  Planned Parenthood kills babies.
[01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:14.843]  There's nothing more evil than killing a baby.
[01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.504]  They talk about, oh, that's women's health care.
[01:24:16.744 --> 01:24:18.045]  What about that baby's health care?
[01:24:18.265 --> 01:24:19.125]  They don't care about that.
[01:24:19.285 --> 01:24:22.987]  And as a matter of fact, they're trying to pass legislation where they can kill a baby 28 days after birth.
[01:24:23.227 --> 01:24:24.467]  That's not a joke!
[01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:25.448]  28 days after birth!
[01:24:25.788 --> 01:24:26.449]  Think about that!
[01:24:26.469 --> 01:24:29.070]  They're ultra-rich people that want to get rid of the rest of us.
[01:24:29.411 --> 01:24:30.832]  And if we let them do it, we deserve it.
[01:24:31.372 --> 01:24:33.153]  Well, you know, sadly, we don't deserve it.
[01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:34.794]  But I know what you're saying, because we're letting them do it.
[01:24:34.814 --> 01:24:35.875]  We're giving them consent.
[01:24:35.915 --> 01:24:38.117]  What they do is they trick us into giving us consent.
[01:24:38.137 --> 01:24:39.918]  And they have to do that for their karma.
[01:24:40.198 --> 01:24:41.419]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:24:41.639 --> 01:24:43.721]  But the sad thing is, everybody else doesn't, Alex.
[01:24:45.157 --> 01:24:50.721]  All right, listen, I want to invite you back again very, very soon to be in studio with us again.
[01:24:50.902 --> 01:24:54.685]  Tell everybody how they follow you, how they find you, and the great work you're doing.
[01:24:55.045 --> 01:24:57.307]  Guys, you can follow me, Alex999.
[01:24:57.447 --> 01:24:58.808]  If you can't find me, you're not looking.
[01:24:58.848 --> 01:25:02.130]  But I just want to say, and I'm not just trying to plug, but guys, you guys need to support Alex.
[01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:09.797]  He's lost his First Amendment right of freedom of speech, and now he's going through an actual legal battle that is unfair for what he said was the truth.
[01:25:09.837 --> 01:25:11.498]  But guys, it's never going to end.
[01:25:11.818 --> 01:25:13.360]  Alex is just an example.
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:14.321]  It's going to happen to you.
[01:25:14.421 --> 01:25:15.182]  It's going to happen to me.
[01:25:15.663 --> 01:25:17.004]  He's just the tip of the spear.
[01:25:17.024 --> 01:25:19.067]  So we need to protect Alex at all costs.
[01:25:19.107 --> 01:25:20.989]  Because by protecting him, you protect people like me.
[01:25:21.009 --> 01:25:22.331]  Because I wouldn't be where I am today.
[01:25:22.411 --> 01:25:25.955]  I wouldn't be making viral videos if it wasn't for a guy like this opening my eyes.
[01:25:25.995 --> 01:25:28.999]  So guys, all I can say is please come and support me.
[01:25:29.059 --> 01:25:30.821]  But definitely support the InfoWars.
[01:25:31.141 --> 01:25:32.642]  I mean, you just do a lot of great videos.
[01:25:32.702 --> 01:25:33.543]  I like your Man on the Street.
[01:25:33.903 --> 01:25:35.104]  I like the reportage you're doing.
[01:25:35.144 --> 01:25:35.505]  It's great.
[01:25:35.525 --> 01:25:36.586]  You do a lot of diverse stuff.
[01:25:36.606 --> 01:25:40.950]  People can find it at Conspiracy Castle, everywhere you've got a great page on Man.Video.
[01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:41.890]  Listen, I'm fine.
[01:25:42.951 --> 01:25:45.353]  In fact, 20% of people used to hate me.
[01:25:45.413 --> 01:25:47.015]  Now I walk down the street, all I get is love.
[01:25:48.136 --> 01:25:49.417]  Because people really are awake now.
[01:25:49.437 --> 01:25:51.499]  Now they've got to put that awakeness into action.
[01:25:51.719 --> 01:26:03.222]   Our issue is, We built Bandot Video and all of this, and we have to pay for our own bandwidth and our own systems and our own uplinks and our own crew and all the infrastructure that costs millions and millions of dollars.
[01:26:04.121 --> 01:26:05.121]  A quarter.
[01:26:05.121 --> 01:26:07.320]   People say, "Well, why doesn't everybody just start their own network?
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.121]  Why doesn't everybody just start their own servers?"
[01:26:09.121 --> 01:26:12.640]   Well, you can go get a video server thing and have a little site you've got with a few
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.181]   thousand viewers here and there, and your bill will be a few hundred bucks a month.
[01:26:16.181 --> 01:26:20.640]   When you're getting five, six, seven, eight million views a day, which some days we get
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:24.921]   10 million, most days about five million alone at Bandot Video.
[01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.201]  Those are people watching those videos.
[01:26:27.201 --> 01:26:28.600]  It's just when you click on it, it counts.
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.621]  Well, some videos are long, some are short.
[01:26:30.621 --> 01:26:33.740]   We serve out people's films that are censored that are two hours long.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.280]   That cost us thousands and thousands of dollars when one of their films gets 500 to a million
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  views.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.421]  I'm not bitching.
[01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:45.400]   I'm just simply saying you cannot fund a better tip of the spear.
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:55.400]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:26:46.442 --> 01:26:47.903]  We have the biggest sale in our history running.
[01:26:47.923 --> 01:26:49.924]  25 to 75% off.
[01:26:50.385 --> 01:26:54.847]  A lot of t-shirts, books and films that are excellent, that are amazing, that I've got to move out.
[01:26:55.368 --> 01:26:57.769]  A clearance sale to get funds even in to operate.
[01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:59.090]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:26:59.150 --> 01:27:00.171]  Up to 75% off.
[01:27:00.431 --> 01:27:03.713]  A bunch of amazing t-shirts that I never wore, never promoted on air.
[01:27:03.733 --> 01:27:04.534]  I wore them privately.
[01:27:05.114 --> 01:27:08.416]  They're like, hey man, you've made like 50 shirts designs last year, Alex.
[01:27:08.436 --> 01:27:09.217]  Most of these I designed.
[01:27:09.417 --> 01:27:10.618]  So some are great, some are okay.
[01:27:11.786 --> 01:27:15.009]  This is why we have a shortfall in just this quarter of $300,000.
[01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:19.112]  So I need to move all this excess inventory out.
[01:27:19.132 --> 01:27:25.437]  A lot of the other stuff has already been sold out, but this is the stuff that hasn't sold out or just came back into stock, like...
[01:27:26.243 --> 01:27:28.865]  The Great Bio-Truth Selenium, 40% off.
[01:27:28.885 --> 01:27:31.207]  The Azo Beets, 40% off.
[01:27:31.427 --> 01:27:34.249]  Again, those sell out quickly, but I'm offering those at a discount, too.
[01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:39.513]  The Super Magnesium Fizzy Drink, it has both the different types of magnesium.
[01:27:39.533 --> 01:27:41.014]  It's really high-end at a low price.
[01:27:41.355 --> 01:27:42.956]  It's back in stock, 25% off.
[01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:45.098]  Vitamin D3 High Quality Gummies, 25% off.
[01:27:45.118 --> 01:27:51.590]   It's all at Infowars.com. But we've got Save the Frogs, Infowars.com,
[01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:54.300]  flags that are big nice flags, $9.95.
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:28:00.460]   T-shirts as low as $5 at cost. Some of them we've got bullet bottles.
[01:28:00.614 --> 01:28:01.134]  EvoTechPlus.com.
[01:28:01.395 --> 01:28:10.435]   We've got so much. We got Let's Go Brandon shirts. We got it all. Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:10.435 --> 01:28:14.994]   Do you got to go? No, I mean, I can stay. Why don't you hold over another 30 minutes with us
[01:28:14.994 --> 01:28:18.914]   because we're going to go into overdrive here in just a few minutes on the other side. And I got
[01:28:18.914 --> 01:28:31.074]   to wrap. I can't. Evatacplus.com. Evatacplus.com. Folks, you all know that Infowars has been looking
[01:28:31.795 --> 01:28:36.114]   for really good sponsors that are top flight, that are high quality products,
[01:28:36.114 --> 01:28:40.434]  that we can stand behind and celebrate and be excited about.
[01:28:40.663 --> 01:28:48.307]  And I have literally prayed to get some great sponsors after the globalists threatened and harassed and everything else, our other good sponsors away.
[01:28:49.228 --> 01:28:57.913]  And now because so many Americans know that giving into tyranny doesn't make it go away, a lot of great sponsors are coming along to support us.
[01:28:58.817 --> 01:29:01.639]  And EBTAC is one of those companies.
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:06.042]  E-V-A-T-A-C plus dot com.
[01:29:07.183 --> 01:29:20.472]  When you go to that website, the site right here on screen, you get access to just amazing tactical gear and bags and knives and daggers and so much other survival gear.
[01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:21.273]  All of it.
[01:29:22.205 --> 01:29:24.766]  Is just the very best you're going to find out there.
[01:29:25.226 --> 01:29:31.229]  But if you were trying to buy one of these knives, and they're exactly the same at one of the big stores like Cabela's, it'd be $100, $200.
[01:29:32.589 --> 01:29:38.491]  We're talking 20, 30, $40 for these knives, and they are high end.
[01:29:38.531 --> 01:29:42.513]  Let me just tell you, this is a real Special Forces style dagger.
[01:29:43.113 --> 01:29:59.417]   I mean, if things really break down and you got to protect yourself, This is just absolutely amazing, top of the line, and it is so inexpensive, it's ready to ship, it's quality, and they are financing the InfoWar.
[01:29:59.617 --> 01:30:03.939]  The folks over at EvatacPlus.com.
[01:30:04.579 --> 01:30:09.958]   evatacplus.com (upbeat music)
[01:30:09.958 --> 01:30:12.539]  (upbeat music)
[01:30:12.539 --> 01:30:22.439]  (dramatic music)
[01:30:22.439 --> 01:30:24.000]  (woman laughing)
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.278]  The biggest scandal was when they spied on my campaign.
[01:30:27.635 --> 01:30:28.676]  They spied on my campaign.
[01:30:28.696 --> 01:30:30.578]  There's no real evidence of that.
[01:30:30.598 --> 01:30:31.198]  Of course there is.
[01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:32.239]  It's all over the place.
[01:30:32.259 --> 01:30:35.483]  A new report from special counsel John Durham.
[01:30:35.523 --> 01:30:45.713]  Clinton campaign lawyers paid a tech company to infiltrate Trump servers to fabricate a connection between Trump and Russia.
[01:30:46.053 --> 01:30:49.474]  Hillary Clinton broke the law to frame Trump as a Russian traitor.
[01:30:49.534 --> 01:30:54.576]  This is truly unprecedented, truly something that has never happened in the history of our great country.
[01:30:54.836 --> 01:30:56.996]  This is a digital insurrection.
[01:30:57.036 --> 01:31:01.758]  Turns out the Trump-Russian collusion story was just a deflection from the Hillary-Russian collusion story.
[01:31:01.798 --> 01:31:02.838]  Trump was right.
[01:31:02.918 --> 01:31:04.698]  Trump was telling the truth.
[01:31:04.778 --> 01:31:07.959]  It was you, Hillary Clinton, who undermined our democracy.
[01:31:07.779 --> 01:31:09.779]  There are people that should go to jail.
[01:31:09.779 --> 01:31:16.779]  [Crowd chanting "Fuck her up"]
[01:31:16.779 --> 01:31:18.779]  [Tires screeching]
[01:31:19.779 --> 01:31:21.779]  [Music]
[01:31:21.779 --> 01:31:23.779]  Two of our best selling products are back in stock.
[01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:25.971]  ThinfoWarsTore.com.
[01:31:26.071 --> 01:31:30.773]  And they will sell out in the next 3-4 months before I get more of the product in if I sell it at full price.
[01:31:31.374 --> 01:31:39.899]  But I want those of you that have been on the fence about getting Winter Sun or getting X3 to try the products and see how amazing they are.
[01:31:39.979 --> 01:31:43.941]  And I believe you will then get hooked on them like myself and my family.
[01:31:44.341 --> 01:31:44.981]  And the crew are.
[01:31:45.502 --> 01:31:47.483]  So again, both these products are back in stock.
[01:31:47.903 --> 01:31:49.384]  Both X3 and Winter Sun.
[01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:57.849]  They are 50% off for a limited time because they're going to sell out at this price, I would estimate, in less than a month.
[01:31:58.369 --> 01:32:02.691]  So, this is your chance to get X3 and experience the good halogens versus the bad halogens.
[01:32:03.072 --> 01:32:07.554]  This is your chance to have the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your immune system as well.
[01:32:07.954 --> 01:32:09.836]  They're amazing and they're at InfoWars4.com.
[01:32:09.896 --> 01:32:13.738]  And the reason this is a 360 win is it funds the operation.
[01:32:14.579 --> 01:32:15.982]  I need funds to run the operation.
[01:32:16.323 --> 01:32:17.245]  You need to be healthy.
[01:32:17.305 --> 01:32:18.347]  We need to stay on air.
[01:32:18.447 --> 01:32:19.409]  It's a match made in heaven.
