[00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:15.355]  By opening the floodgates to unfettered free speech, Elon Musk has allowed hate to spread far and fast on Twitter.
[00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:26.300]  While the left winds out another distraction about Matt Taibbi catering to the richest man in the world, what do the Twitter files reveal about the inner workings of
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.881]  I'm good.
[00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:50.284]  And if it turns out there are a lot of us on this list, where the DNC targeted us,
[00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:22.407]  And I will quote the immortal words of Joseph Welch when he attacked Joe McCarthy for the enemies list he had.
[00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:25.650]  At long last, sir, have you no shame?
[00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.774]  President Biden, all of your
[00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:37.263]  Toxie's little operative in the DNC who have targeted American citizens.
[00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:42.267]  Have you, Mr. President, have all of you at last.
[00:01:42.267 --> 00:01:43.368]  No shame.
[00:01:43.368 --> 00:01:48.333]  Taibbi points out that both parties had access to these tools.
[00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:56.541]  For instance, in 2020, requests from both the Trump White House and the Biden campaign were received and honored.
[00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:05.444]  But the overwhelming amount of leftist Marxist cucks staffed at Twitter ensured that Democrat Party requests took the front burner.
[00:02:05.444 --> 00:02:13.827]  A fact backed up by the overall donations by Twitter to the Democrat Party reaching 99.73% or $165,969 to Democrats while $451 went to Republicans in 2022.
[00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.992]  Are you worried about these Twitter files coming out?
[00:02:25.992 --> 00:02:33.717]  What was that experience like having Kellyanne, who's always in control of herself, siccing this MAGA trolls on you?
[00:02:33.717 --> 00:02:34.697]  It's terrifying.
[00:02:34.697 --> 00:02:44.424]  When you get targeted in some of these ways, it's hard to differentiate between what is somebody just online trying to rattle you and what's a real threat.
[00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:53.388]  You see in things like Pizzagate that online conspiracies can mobilize very real and very direct offline violence.
[00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:54.609]  I saw those harms.
[00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.230]  I experienced those harms.
[00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.114]  And now it was those harms through a mainstream news outlet being held up in the Oval Office by the former President of the United States.
[00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:06.655]  Deeply terrifying.
[00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:22.023]  What does appear to be illegal to the point of treason is that a false narrative of possible foreign hacks supposedly behind the Biden laptop debacle was manufactured by Silicon Valley, the media, and the DNC.
[00:03:22.023 --> 00:03:27.646]  Well, we know that this whole smear on Joe Biden comes from the Kremlin.
[00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:33.870]  That's been clear for well over a year now that they've been pushing this false narrative about the Vice President and his son.
[00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.195]  According to internal emails, there was zero evidence of foreign interference occurring.
[00:03:40.195 --> 00:03:55.887]  What did occur was a meltdown of internal Twitter censorship spearheaded by top Twitter management, with the result of ultimately burying a critical story under false pretenses in order to sway popular opinion and alter the outcome
[00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:56.207]  We're good.
[00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:33.046]  Not only have Twitter employees like Head of Legal, Policy and Trust Vijaya Gadhi and Trust and Safety Chief Yoel Roth proven that they willingly altered the 2020 U.S.
[00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:47.053]  presidential election, but they have demonstrated that Silicon Valley, the Mockingbird Media, and the corruption in Washington is an occupying force and a direct threat to the stability and the future of the United States of America.
[00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.020]  This cyber insurrection is what I'm calling it.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.813]  It's an assault on this country and it's borderline treason if you think about what the executives did on Twitter.
[00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:09.744]  December 2022 is here, and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:05:09.744 --> 00:05:13.586]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:22.651]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company, and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:24.692]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[00:05:25.472 --> 00:05:28.894]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:30.354]  This is a game changer.
[00:05:30.354 --> 00:05:31.895]  We're so excited about it.
[00:05:31.895 --> 00:05:34.156]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:38.578]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:41.699]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.140]  The same great customer service and more.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.883]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[00:05:50.743 --> 00:05:58.395]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep Inforwards on the air at InforwardsTour.com.
[00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:11.574]  Big Brother.
[00:06:11.574 --> 00:06:13.376]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:13.376 --> 00:06:15.297]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:15.297 --> 00:06:16.979]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.620]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.745]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:23.745 --> 00:06:26.727]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:43.356]  An honor and a privilege to be with you here on this Thursday, December 8, 2022 edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:43.356 --> 00:06:53.140]  Yesterday I said to the crew, when I found out I would be doing double duty today, I said, let's get Darren Beattie on.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.061]  He's constantly
[00:06:55.066 --> 00:07:16.236]  Following big news stories he'll probably have something big to break and then surely enough today there are a bunch of January 6th developments and so Darren Beatty going to be joining us to discuss that and some other things he's breaking at revolver.news.
[00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:23.520]  There's a couple stories today that really just show you where the world is going and
[00:07:25.302 --> 00:07:32.186]  You know, there's a way... I am a believer in metaphysics, if you will.
[00:07:32.186 --> 00:07:35.828]  Call it karma.
[00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:48.374]  But there are multiple stories today that if we, the people, not just of America, but of planet Earth, don't have a problem with this, then in a way we deserve what we get.
[00:07:48.374 --> 00:07:50.315]  And it's not even fair to say that.
[00:07:50.315 --> 00:07:51.676]  You don't deserve to be a slave.
[00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:57.371]  You don't deserve to be abused by your government.
[00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:59.092]  You don't deserve to live in fear.
[00:07:59.092 --> 00:08:12.599]  You don't deserve to work your entire life and pay a quarter of your earnings to the government that they then dole out however they feel fit, giving it to their friends, giving it to wars, laundering it, whatever.
[00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:15.421]  You breaking your neck, breaking your back.
[00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:21.264]  Specifically, if you're a small business owner or the entrepreneurial type, you know especially
[00:08:22.827 --> 00:08:34.013]  The daunting task of just legally owning and operating a business in this country now, because our government is so out of control.
[00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:45.459]  And then the fear of not doing it right, that they'll send their goons at the IRS after you, or worse.
[00:08:45.459 --> 00:08:48.760]  But what am I talking about?
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.481]  How is it
[00:08:50.888 --> 00:08:54.350]  That Sam Bankman Freed has not yet been arrested.
[00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.571]  Would somebody like to explain that?
[00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:57.533]  Well, of course you know the answer.
[00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:03.156]  Because he does the Democrats' money laundering.
[00:09:03.156 --> 00:09:10.962]  And I'm not even sure how aware Sam Bankman Freed is about what he was up to or what he was being used for.
[00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:13.884]  Still to this day, I'm not sure he has a clue.
[00:09:13.884 --> 00:09:15.005]  He seems pretty clueless.
[00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:36.781]  Maybe on the autism spectrum or something like that, and that's why his Democrat parents, just like the Democrat parents of Caroline Ellison, probably a similar story, used them as a front man and a front woman for the biggest money laundering operation maybe in world history?
[00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:42.806]  I mean, you could make arguments about what's your definition of money laundering, but
[00:09:44.306 --> 00:09:51.908]  Just face value, this case is the biggest money laundering story of all time.
[00:09:51.908 --> 00:09:56.589]  And the people at the front of it have not been arrested.
[00:09:56.589 --> 00:10:05.612]  And now Maxine Waters, who's one of the most corrupt politicians in US history, but she's on the oversight board in the House.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.141]  In charge of investigating stuff like this.
[00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:12.103]  And she also has her own ethics violations.
[00:10:12.103 --> 00:10:19.486]  And her and her husband have been bailing out banks and making money in kickbacks all of these years.
[00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:24.589]  True, true, dirty, corrupt people.
[00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:34.594]  And Maxine Waters says she's not going to subpoena Sam Bankman Freed because, you know, they're just such good friends.
[00:10:35.933 --> 00:10:37.955]  They are just such good friends.
[00:10:37.955 --> 00:10:43.839]  So now your only hope is that, as the Republicans have the Senate, that they'll be able to subpoena him.
[00:10:43.839 --> 00:10:46.441]  How much you want to bet that doesn't happen?
[00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:48.703]  You know who's in charge of the Senate, right?
[00:10:48.703 --> 00:10:49.704]  Mitch McConnell.
[00:10:49.704 --> 00:10:53.026]  You know who took millions of dollars from Sam Bankman Freed, right?
[00:10:53.026 --> 00:10:54.347]  Mitch McConnell.
[00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:55.668]  Don't get your hopes up.
[00:10:55.668 --> 00:10:59.211]  Sam Bankman Freed is going to walk a free man.
[00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:01.213]  See, oh, you had a little COVID violation?
[00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:25.897]  Oh, you opened your church, you opened your business during COVID while the strip clubs and the liquor stores and the pot stores were all open, and you opened your hair salon, or you opened your vitamins store, or your farmers market, and then you dealt with the full onslaught of our big government law enforcement, but the biggest money laundering operation
[00:11:26.966 --> 00:11:29.287]  Not just in terms of dollars.
[00:11:29.287 --> 00:11:31.549]  I mean, definitely it's in terms of dollars.
[00:11:31.549 --> 00:11:32.870]  I mean, what are we really looking at?
[00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.852]  Thirty billion dollars missing?
[00:11:35.852 --> 00:11:45.477]  But the implications of how it went through Ukraine, where we're being lied to about a war that we're funding, that we're arming, that nobody else is interested in except us?
[00:11:45.477 --> 00:11:48.639]  And the two parties involved?
[00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:50.300]  That has major implications.
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.324]  The fact that Sam Bankman-Fried was donating millions of dollars
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.943]  To the political parties, hundreds of millions, even to the Democrats.
[00:11:59.943 --> 00:12:02.324]  Maybe tens of millions to the Republicans.
[00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:06.327]  It's about a 20 to 1 ratio, Democrat to Republicans, but they're both in there.
[00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:10.150]  That has major implications.
[00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:12.572]  But see, he's not going to be arrested.
[00:12:12.572 --> 00:12:14.934]  Caroline Ellison isn't going to be arrested.
[00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:21.859]  He's running around the Bahamas in his flip-flops and his cargo pants and his Bahama shirt.
[00:12:23.447 --> 00:12:30.071]  And then Caroline Ellison, she's running around New York City doing whatever she wants, nobody knows, nobody cares.
[00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:36.955]  And I've reached out, we've reached out to Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, he's been on before.
[00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:44.899]  But he's trying to get a group of people to go down there in a form of protest to raise awareness that this crook is on the loose still.
[00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:49.742]  But he's a good money launderer for the deep state, he's a good money launderer for the Democrats, so
[00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:53.319]  He gets away with it.
[00:12:53.319 --> 00:12:55.202]  He gets away with it.
[00:12:55.202 --> 00:12:59.207]  Now, why is that so important?
[00:12:59.207 --> 00:13:00.208]  Because it shows
[00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:02.766]  That justice is dead.
[00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:11.815]  It shows that if you're well-connected to the deep state, well-connected to the Democrat Party or the Republican Party, that you're above the law.
[00:13:11.815 --> 00:13:15.098]  But we, the American people, we don't get such treatment, you see.
[00:13:15.098 --> 00:13:17.421]  We get treated like dirt by our government.
[00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:19.382]  We get treated like scum.
[00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.805]  They call us terrorists.
[00:13:21.805 --> 00:13:22.866]  The bastards.
[00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:23.827]  They're the terrorists.
[00:13:27.219 --> 00:13:29.781]  And then the story out of New Zealand.
[00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:31.803]  We had the guests on yesterday.
[00:13:31.803 --> 00:13:33.625]  It's so sad when this happens.
[00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:39.750]  Especially right after people come on our transmission with big news and then the next day they get hit with a hammer.
[00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.013]  We're not talking Paul Pelosi style.
[00:13:43.013 --> 00:13:49.559]  New Zealand takes custody of baby over parents transfusion objection.
[00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:53.363]  Because they don't want to get the COVID vaccine blood.
[00:13:55.049 --> 00:14:02.714]  Which is causing clots and strokes and heart attacks and all kinds of stuff.
[00:14:02.714 --> 00:14:17.083]  And now their baby has been taken from their custody and we have a statement from the parents that were on yesterday that I will read today on the air.
[00:14:18.905 --> 00:14:20.226]  So why is that so important?
[00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:23.547]  Because it shows you what the medical tyranny is really all about.
[00:14:23.547 --> 00:14:27.129]  It's not about keeping you safe.
[00:14:27.129 --> 00:14:31.510]  It's not about making sure people have access to medicine or health care.
[00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.431]  No, that's all nonsense.
[00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:35.572]  It was always about control.
[00:14:35.572 --> 00:14:37.793]  And that's what they saw.
[00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:40.894]  We're not talking about the globalists that ran the whole scamdemic.
[00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:46.577]  We're talking about your average liberal democrat that saw a pandemic and said, how can I seize
[00:14:48.735 --> 00:14:53.217]  How can I become more powerful?
[00:14:53.217 --> 00:14:56.479]  How can I control the masses?
[00:14:56.479 --> 00:15:03.722]  How can I use this fear to intimidate and destroy?
[00:15:03.722 --> 00:15:05.383]  And then that's what they've done.
[00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:09.165]  And so you don't want your little baby to get that experimental vaccine.
[00:15:09.165 --> 00:15:13.487]  You don't want your little baby to get blood from somebody that's taken the vaccine.
[00:15:13.487 --> 00:15:15.008]  You demand pure blood.
[00:15:15.008 --> 00:15:16.429]  You lose your baby.
[00:15:17.725 --> 00:15:21.547]  Now tell me how that's about health and tell me how that's about safety.
[00:15:21.547 --> 00:15:22.107]  It's not.
[00:15:22.107 --> 00:15:23.528]  It was always about control.
[00:15:23.528 --> 00:15:26.429]  So you see, you're a slave now.
[00:15:26.429 --> 00:15:29.851]  You don't properly adhere to the medical tyranny.
[00:15:29.851 --> 00:15:32.552]  You lose your child.
[00:15:32.552 --> 00:15:34.773]  You lose your job.
[00:15:34.773 --> 00:15:36.754]  You lose your freedom.
[00:15:36.754 --> 00:15:41.036]  You lose your bank account.
[00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:45.658]  And then you realize, maybe you're not so free after all.
[00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:57.302]  So those are just a couple examples of the stories we have coming up today and of course we'll talk about Brittany Griner being released and some of the details behind that and more today on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:06.840]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:12.402]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:14.902]  But thank God that we have you.
[00:16:14.902 --> 00:16:21.344]  All of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.

[00:17:00.447 --> 00:17:07.451]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:17:07.451 --> 00:17:12.634]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:17:12.634 --> 00:17:19.678]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:17:19.678 --> 00:17:23.741]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:27.883]  And you can do that now at Infowarestore.com.

[00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:05.746]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:17.423]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[00:18:17.423 --> 00:18:30.173]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[00:18:30.854 --> 00:18:31.374]  Thank you.
[00:19:00.387 --> 00:19:07.314]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:13.200]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:19.567]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:27.096]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[00:19:27.096 --> 00:19:37.408]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:46.811]  As for Vitamin C and Zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:53.073]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[00:19:53.073 --> 00:20:01.016]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[00:20:01.016 --> 00:20:06.898]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:20.428 --> 00:20:23.889]  Man, I'll tell ya, we are just in the clown world.
[00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:33.194]  Do you ever just sit there and just soak it all in and just say, how is this possible?
[00:20:33.194 --> 00:20:35.115]  How did humanity get so insane?
[00:20:36.786 --> 00:20:38.367]  Can we return from this?
[00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:39.987]  Has it always been this way?
[00:20:39.987 --> 00:20:45.490]  Are we destined to be run by crooks and demons the rest of our lifetimes?
[00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:49.571]  This cannot be the future for humanity.
[00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:53.713]  This cannot be the future for America.
[00:20:53.713 --> 00:20:59.575]  And I'm just going through some of these clips we'll get to later of the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
[00:20:59.575 --> 00:21:02.577]  And I'm not even listening to the clips, I'm just going through the list
[00:21:03.424 --> 00:21:09.666]  Deciding which ones I want to play, reading the quotes, and I'm... I'm dying of laughter here.
[00:21:09.666 --> 00:21:12.847]  I mean, I'm literally, like, laughing hysterically.
[00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:14.727]  Because it's so ridiculous.
[00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:21.910]  I mean, I've got Karine Jean-Pierre saying that the White House has been doing great work lowering prices and fighting inflation.
[00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.070]  Uh... What?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:33.102]  That's like if I came in today and I, you know, let's say I have somebody that decides my clothes, and I say, yeah, I'd like a white shirt with a blue jacket.
[00:21:33.102 --> 00:21:36.903]  Well, I've got a black shirt with a black jacket.
[00:21:36.903 --> 00:21:42.124]  Or me telling the crew, hey, I want an image of the beach behind me.
[00:21:42.124 --> 00:21:43.925]  It's woods.
[00:21:43.925 --> 00:21:48.246]  It's a coniferous forest with snow.
[00:21:48.246 --> 00:21:53.647]  And then saying, look at me in my white shirt with my blue blazer and my beach background.
[00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:59.782]  And you'd say, you're wearing a black shirt with a black blazer and you have a winter background.
[00:21:59.782 --> 00:22:00.883]  Well, that's the Biden White House.
[00:22:00.883 --> 00:22:05.184]  They're fighting inflation and they're lowering costs.
[00:22:05.184 --> 00:22:10.025]  But let me just look at this story with the Brittany Griner situation.
[00:22:10.025 --> 00:22:13.606]  Because there's some... I don't think we're getting the full story.
[00:22:13.606 --> 00:22:15.386]  I mean, of course we're not.
[00:22:15.386 --> 00:22:17.187]  And people are pointing out some of the anomalies.
[00:22:17.187 --> 00:22:18.187]  Here's the basic facts.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:31.625]  Britney Griner released from a Russian jail in exchange for international arms dealer Victor Bout, known as the Merchant of Death.
[00:22:31.625 --> 00:22:34.226]  So this offer was on the table six months ago.
[00:22:34.226 --> 00:22:36.207]  Britney Griner could have been freed six months ago.
[00:22:36.207 --> 00:22:38.388]  Why didn't it happen then?
[00:22:38.388 --> 00:22:43.550]  Well, the response is that it's because the U.S.
[00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:49.853]  was trying to work out a deal, a two-man deal, so that they can get Waylon released as well.
[00:22:51.994 --> 00:23:03.541]  Now, when you look at this, you say, okay, let's try to be reasonable and fair here.
[00:23:03.541 --> 00:23:14.147]  And it's pretty obvious that if there was a priority of who was to be released, it would be Paul Whelan.
[00:23:14.147 --> 00:23:15.188]  I don't even think that that
[00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.270]  Would be a debate.
[00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.591]  He's a former U.S.
[00:23:20.591 --> 00:23:32.337]  Marine who's been over there for years versus a basketball player who hasn't been there as long.
[00:23:32.337 --> 00:23:43.722]  Now, maybe if this was like Michael Jordan, you would get it, but still, I think if you're being fully honest, the Marine should probably get the priority.
[00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:54.036]  Considering the status that we claim to revere of U.S.
[00:23:54.036 --> 00:23:56.378]  Veteran.
[00:23:56.378 --> 00:23:56.678]  U.S.
[00:23:56.678 --> 00:23:58.819]  Marine.
[00:23:58.819 --> 00:24:01.941]  But no, it's a female basketball player.
[00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:06.343]  So why did the U.S.
[00:24:06.343 --> 00:24:11.045]  prioritize Brittany Griner over Paul Whelan?
[00:24:11.045 --> 00:24:11.806]  And we all know why.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:20.688]  Because she's a black, gay woman, liberal.
[00:24:20.688 --> 00:24:25.233]  And now they know she's going to come back and be a good Democrat spokesperson.
[00:24:25.233 --> 00:24:28.837]  She's not going to talk about how grateful she is to be back in the United States of America.
[00:24:28.837 --> 00:24:29.558]  I doubt that.
[00:24:29.558 --> 00:24:30.359]  I hope she would.
[00:24:32.281 --> 00:24:33.282]  But no.
[00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:39.167]  Why was Brittany Griner a higher priority for the Biden administration than Paul Whelan?
[00:24:39.167 --> 00:24:49.515]  Because of publicity, and because she has the right attributes, let's say.
[00:24:49.515 --> 00:24:53.878]  Now, Brittany, I don't believe she doesn't belong in prison.
[00:24:53.878 --> 00:24:55.420]  I don't think it should be a crime.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.842]  What she had, some weed juice,
[00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:03.013]  She's like smoking a cigarette pen, but it's for weed.
[00:25:03.013 --> 00:25:06.296]  Look, I don't want to get into the whole thing of is Britney Griner transgender.
[00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.477]  I just don't even want to go down there.
[00:25:07.477 --> 00:25:08.638]  It's pointless.
[00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:10.099]  It doesn't matter.
[00:25:10.099 --> 00:25:14.382]  And quite frankly, I think if she was, the Russians would have figured it out and probably made a story of it.
[00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:14.843]  Maybe not.
[00:25:14.843 --> 00:25:16.284]  Maybe they're using it as blackmail.
[00:25:16.284 --> 00:25:16.704]  I don't know.
[00:25:16.704 --> 00:25:19.227]  I don't really care to go down it.
[00:25:19.227 --> 00:25:24.151]  The point is the Biden administration prioritized a basketball player over a Marine.
[00:25:25.356 --> 00:25:26.756]  And that should tell you something.
[00:25:26.756 --> 00:25:28.037]  There should be something there.
[00:25:28.037 --> 00:25:30.957]  Again, that's not a slight to Brittany Griner.
[00:25:30.957 --> 00:25:31.618]  Good for her.
[00:25:31.618 --> 00:25:33.038]  I'm sure she's so relieved.
[00:25:33.038 --> 00:25:35.379]  I don't think she belonged there.
[00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:37.919]  But that's Russian loss.
[00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:40.240]  And she's not the only one that suffered because of it.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.421]  But they prioritized, because here's how they look at it.
[00:25:44.335 --> 00:25:49.417]  They value a black woman, a gay person, or a basketball player.
[00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:52.179]  It could have been any combination of that.
[00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:53.559]  She checks all three boxes.
[00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:59.002]  It could have just been one of them, and they would have still prioritized that over a U.S.
[00:25:59.002 --> 00:26:01.203]  Marine, an American veteran.
[00:26:01.203 --> 00:26:05.745]  That's where the Democrat Party is at ideologically.
[00:26:05.745 --> 00:26:09.326]  That's where the Democrat Party is at politically.
[00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:10.707]  Well, then you ask the other question.
[00:26:12.139 --> 00:26:12.959]  Is it worth it?
[00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:14.600]  Is the trade worth it?
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:32.850]  To trade an arms dealer known as the Merchant of Death, a serious criminal, a guy who probably does belong in jail, to keep the world safer, for a woman that doesn't belong in jail, while you're supposedly at war with Russia.
[00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:39.293]  So, you didn't care about the US Marine enough to get the deal done for him to get out,
[00:26:42.543 --> 00:26:57.815]  You then released somebody who's immediately going to be thrown into the war in Ukraine, which the United States' stance is a war against Russia, an illegal, illegitimate war against Russia that the Biden administration has launched without congressional approval.
[00:26:57.815 --> 00:27:00.738]  And this guy's about to go right back into the playing field.
[00:27:02.324 --> 00:27:04.686]  And what is Brittany Griner going to do?
[00:27:04.686 --> 00:27:06.527]  Come back and play basketball.
[00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:20.657]  And so now you're going to have people fighting this arms dealer, fighting the weapons that he gets, and Brittany Griner will continue to play basketball in front of tiny audiences.
[00:27:20.657 --> 00:27:21.338]  And the U.S.
[00:27:21.338 --> 00:27:24.020]  Marine still rots in jail.
[00:27:25.595 --> 00:27:27.676]  Now, consider this.
[00:27:27.676 --> 00:27:36.058]  It was not a coincidence that this happened right after the midterm runoff last night.
[00:27:36.058 --> 00:27:38.459]  So that one kind of confuses me.
[00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:52.284]  That's definitely not a coincidence, but the Democrats obviously knew to some extent it was bad publicity to trade a basketball player for an arms dealer while you're at war with Russia
[00:27:53.206 --> 00:28:00.409]  They knew that there was enough bad publicity or potential for bad publicity that they did it after the runoff in Georgia.
[00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:03.691]  That was not a coincidence.
[00:28:03.691 --> 00:28:18.237]  And so now they have more time to steer this narrative and try to turn it into a good thing instead of the obvious gut reaction from so many Americans today, which is, hey, we're glad Britney Griner is home, good for her and her wife there, but
[00:28:19.318 --> 00:28:25.385]  This is clearly horrible diplomacy from the Biden administration.
[00:28:25.385 --> 00:28:28.128]  Clearly the priorities are off.
[00:28:28.128 --> 00:28:35.436]  And that would have been everybody's response, saying, how does a basketball player get higher priority than a veteran who's been over there longer?
[00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:41.339]  But I think there's another, I think there's another ripple to this.
[00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:48.401]  And I think it goes into the larger geopolitical issues that we're facing in the world right now.
[00:28:48.401 --> 00:28:51.201]  And I'll get into that on the other side.
[00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:53.822]  But man, you ever seen a woman dunk like that?
[00:28:53.822 --> 00:28:55.222]  Woo!
[00:28:55.222 --> 00:28:56.903]  We get to see it again, alright!
[00:28:56.903 --> 00:28:57.823]  Joanna Mann, yeah!

[00:29:36.354 --> 00:29:43.037]  So again, that's free shipping on all orders, $50 or more at infowarestore.com.
[00:29:43.297 --> 00:29:43.938]  We're good to go.
[00:30:00.743 --> 00:30:07.726]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:30:07.726 --> 00:30:12.929]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:19.972]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:30:19.972 --> 00:30:24.014]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:30:24.014 --> 00:30:28.176]  And you can do that now at infowarestore.com.
[00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:29.777]  Help us clear out our stock
[00:30:30.117 --> 00:30:35.081]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and merry Christmas.
[00:31:00.109 --> 00:31:11.593]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:16.055]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:31:16.055 --> 00:31:20.016]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:31:20.016 --> 00:31:24.457]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:31:24.457 --> 00:31:25.518]  You see, the sun
[00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:26.558]  I think so.
[00:31:50.166 --> 00:31:53.929]  At InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:54.629]  Don't wait!

[00:32:00.123 --> 00:32:20.758]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[00:32:21.318 --> 00:32:34.361]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:43.223]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:32:43.223 --> 00:32:49.644]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:51.165]  So, continue to do it.
[00:32:51.165 --> 00:32:53.367]  Go to places like Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:55.469]  Go to the places like Save Infowars.
[00:32:55.469 --> 00:33:00.414]  Continue to keep Infowars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[00:33:18.456 --> 00:33:21.657]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[00:33:21.657 --> 00:33:28.859]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:33:28.859 --> 00:33:39.302]  It's hard to make sense of the Brittany Griner prisoner swap.
[00:33:39.302 --> 00:33:44.184]  And part of me says, well, okay, we can always peek behind the curtain and maybe it makes sense, or
[00:33:45.589 --> 00:33:50.032]  Well, chalk it up to nothing this administration does make sense.
[00:33:50.032 --> 00:33:55.115]  Chalk it up to the nonsensical ideology that occupies their brains.
[00:33:55.115 --> 00:33:58.496]  That prioritizes... It could have been one of these check boxes.
[00:33:58.496 --> 00:34:05.460]  Gay, black, probably woman, but basketball player.
[00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:12.965]  And Greiner just happened to check all three boxes, so she was a higher priority than the Marine that's still over there.
[00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:18.082]  She could have just been gay, or she could have just been black, or she could have just been a ball player.
[00:34:18.082 --> 00:34:20.084]  Probably would have been the same story.
[00:34:20.084 --> 00:34:22.406]  But because she checked all three, it was a no-brainer.
[00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:27.770]  Whelan was not even in the discussion.
[00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:34.256]  And now, as you're at war with Russia, you just released one of their top arms dealers back into the playing field.
[00:34:34.256 --> 00:34:37.678]  So, I mean, it's just cuckoo land.
[00:34:37.678 --> 00:34:40.961]  But that's what we get from the Democrat Party.
[00:34:40.961 --> 00:34:41.842]  It's all cuckoo land.
[00:34:43.203 --> 00:34:47.265]  Now what is this being reported by the Daily Mail?
[00:34:47.265 --> 00:35:04.112]  Saudi Crown Prince brokered deal to swap WNBA star Brittany Griner for merchant of death arms dealer Victor Bout who walked past each other on the UAE airport tarmac two days after America dropped Khashoggi lawsuit against the Saudi leader.
[00:35:04.112 --> 00:35:06.714]  So is this Saudi Arabia
[00:35:07.717 --> 00:35:24.877]  With their increasing good relations with Russia, throwing some of their leverage around, was this actually discussed when Joe Biden was kissing the boots and licking the floors in Saudi Arabia?
[00:35:26.243 --> 00:35:28.003]  Begging them for more oil.
[00:35:28.003 --> 00:35:29.624]  They said no.
[00:35:29.624 --> 00:35:32.684]  Only to increase output after the midterms.
[00:35:32.684 --> 00:35:35.585]  After Joe Biden cut a deal with Venezuela.
[00:35:35.585 --> 00:35:40.326]  So Joe Biden got double teamed in the foreign diplomatic negotiations.
[00:35:40.326 --> 00:35:42.506]  The media completely missed that story.
[00:35:42.506 --> 00:35:43.786]  But what do you expect?
[00:35:43.786 --> 00:35:47.547]  They're all in the tank for Biden anyway.
[00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:50.188]  Now this wouldn't surprise me.
[00:35:50.188 --> 00:35:51.868]  And it's a hard
[00:35:52.793 --> 00:35:58.476]  Thing for Americans to understand or conceive or accept.
[00:35:58.476 --> 00:36:04.040]  But the United States of America is now a laughingstock to the world.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:13.585]  To all major industrious countries, Joe Biden's America is a joke.
[00:36:13.585 --> 00:36:15.526]  A joke.
[00:36:15.526 --> 00:36:21.310]  Even with the lack of respect many of these countries had for Obama, there was at least some dignity there.
[00:36:23.979 --> 00:36:37.052]  And then Trump, we were really starting to climb that totem pole again of respect and of, I mean, you could say power, but really that's just because Trump started exporting energy.
[00:36:37.052 --> 00:36:38.033]  That's really all it would take.
[00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.691]  And now you have this doddering old fool.
[00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:45.251]  No world leaders believe he actually won the election.
[00:36:45.251 --> 00:36:48.052]  They all know it was a big thief job.
[00:36:48.052 --> 00:36:49.072]  He doesn't know where he is.
[00:36:49.072 --> 00:36:50.832]  He doesn't know who he is.
[00:36:50.832 --> 00:36:52.973]  His vice president is Kamala Harris.
[00:36:52.973 --> 00:36:56.094]  She's nowhere near where she belongs.
[00:36:56.094 --> 00:37:06.216]  Kamala Harris is like a single A bullpen catcher on a starting roster for the MLB All-Star game.
[00:37:08.414 --> 00:37:12.536]  Everybody watching is going to know that ain't the real deal.
[00:37:12.536 --> 00:37:17.498]  That player don't belong here.
[00:37:17.498 --> 00:37:21.619]  I mean, that's not even fair to bullpen catchers.
[00:37:21.619 --> 00:37:24.941]  She's like a high school catching coach.
[00:37:26.465 --> 00:37:30.647]  On the field in the World Series, everybody knows she doesn't belong.
[00:37:30.647 --> 00:37:35.909]  Everybody knows, they're nudging, they're winking, they're like, what is she doing here?
[00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:37.349]  What is this embarrassment?
[00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:40.550]  That's Biden-Harris.
[00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:53.575]  So I definitely think Saudi Arabia threw some weight around here to help Russia get this arms dealer back in the war.
[00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:54.956]  And that was kind of their little
[00:37:56.021 --> 00:38:01.905]  Tip of the hat or nod to Russia saying, hey, we're in this.
[00:38:01.905 --> 00:38:05.688]  We're with you.
[00:38:05.688 --> 00:38:06.749]  What an embarrassment.
[00:38:06.749 --> 00:38:10.011]  What an embarrassment for the United States on the world stage.
[00:38:10.011 --> 00:38:16.896]  Foreign leaders are running laps around Joe Biden.
[00:38:16.896 --> 00:38:18.537]  And then this was also in the news.
[00:38:18.537 --> 00:38:22.720]  Chinese leader and Saudi king sign strategic partnership agreement.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.801]  So here's what's going on.
[00:38:24.895 --> 00:38:32.296]  Because you can flesh all of this out with actual geopolitical developments.
[00:38:32.296 --> 00:38:34.077]  And I actually took a bunch of notes on this yesterday.
[00:38:34.077 --> 00:38:35.697]  This is going to be my lead story on the war room.
[00:38:35.697 --> 00:38:38.458]  Of course, I left my notes at home today, but I still remember most of it.
[00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:44.219]  Writing things down is one of the best ways to learn and remember things.
[00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:51.420]  The BRICS system that's being set up right now, this is the future.
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:51.540]  And
[00:38:53.604 --> 00:39:16.022]  The world leaders that are rational and not totally corrupt or just straight-up pedophiles or blackmailed or whatever know that the financial system is going to collapse and know that in specific the Western system, the United States system is going to collapse and we're not taking any of the proper measurements to stop it.
[00:39:16.022 --> 00:39:22.246]  So the BRICS system has been set up by other first world leading nations
[00:39:23.479 --> 00:39:34.001]  To say, look, we can have a financial infrastructure, we can have a trading infrastructure set up that will allow us to not just survive the U.S.
[00:39:34.001 --> 00:39:35.481]  dollar collapsing or the U.S.
[00:39:35.481 --> 00:39:47.164]  economy collapsing, but then in that moment being ready to just assume full control over world trade and geopolitical relations.
[00:39:47.164 --> 00:39:48.304]  Now here's the damn shame of it.
[00:39:51.423 --> 00:39:56.567]  Xi Jinping, as you see on the left side of the screen there, shouldn't be in there.
[00:39:56.567 --> 00:40:00.471]  Instead, that should be Donald Trump.
[00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:02.633]  But here's what's happened.
[00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:03.614]  Because the U.S.
[00:40:03.614 --> 00:40:08.478]  has become so pathetic, and frankly Trump could have done more, but what was he supposed to do?
[00:40:08.478 --> 00:40:15.103]  He had the media on his back all the time, demonizing Russia all the time, so he couldn't cut deals with Russia.
[00:40:15.103 --> 00:40:16.605]  Attacking Bolsonaro all the time.
[00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:24.154]  Under all of his own investigation, so he can never properly address this.
[00:40:24.154 --> 00:40:27.257]  But instead of the U.S.
[00:40:27.257 --> 00:40:34.823]  completing that chain, now it's China.
[00:40:34.823 --> 00:40:37.966]  And I just wish our leaders could see the potential.
[00:40:37.966 --> 00:40:38.666]  And you know what?
[00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:40.708]  Sadly, it may be dead now.
[00:40:40.708 --> 00:40:42.350]  Sadly, the opportunity may have passed.
[00:40:43.351 --> 00:40:44.933]  And quite frankly, I'd say it has.
[00:40:44.933 --> 00:40:48.937]  We got two more years of this clown in the White House, so... It's done, folks.
[00:40:48.937 --> 00:40:49.697]  It's done.
[00:40:49.697 --> 00:40:53.020]  The only option America has now is fully independence.
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:58.886]  If we believe that our country is going to stay in the world marketplace and remain a world power, we're idiots.
[00:40:58.886 --> 00:40:59.787]  It ain't happening.
[00:40:59.787 --> 00:41:01.689]  We're being left off the table.
[00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:05.493]  Joe Biden is sitting under the table, crawling around, begging for breadcrumbs.
[00:41:06.937 --> 00:41:08.357]  And he shut off our energy.
[00:41:08.357 --> 00:41:10.798]  If he didn't shut off our energy, it wouldn't matter.
[00:41:10.798 --> 00:41:11.999]  We could be energy independent.
[00:41:11.999 --> 00:41:13.079]  We'd be exporting energy.
[00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.019]  We'd be fine.
[00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:15.340]  We'd find ways to deal.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.081]  But he has shut off our energy.
[00:41:19.081 --> 00:41:21.021]  And so we're begging for scraps.
[00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:23.342]  We're not even invited to the table anymore.
[00:41:23.342 --> 00:41:36.326]  I wish our leadership could have seen the potential of a BRICS system, but with the United States and Brazil and Russia
[00:41:37.907 --> 00:42:00.289]  As the three partnership countries to lead the way, and then every single puzzle piece would fall into place from there, and it would be the Chinese communists that get cut out, and then we could save the millions of people in China that are in prison camps, we could save the billions of Chinese people that are being oppressed by their government, and we could have a world system based on free market capitalism.
[00:42:01.092 --> 00:42:08.775]  Which has spurred the industrial revolution, which has taken these countries into the first world, out of the third world pits.
[00:42:08.775 --> 00:42:10.896]  And like Saudi Arabia, they all know it.
[00:42:10.896 --> 00:42:12.996]  And that's why they're scratching their heads like, why is the U.S.
[00:42:12.996 --> 00:42:13.356]  doing this?
[00:42:13.356 --> 00:42:13.877]  Why is the U.S.
[00:42:13.877 --> 00:42:16.057]  committing suicide?
[00:42:16.057 --> 00:42:22.680]  But okay, well look, you got a guy stabbing himself in the neck and running into walls, eventually you just say, okay, time to move on.
[00:42:24.198 --> 00:42:31.003]  And then out of the US, Brazil, and Russia, you would have really seen the world powers for freedom align.
[00:42:31.003 --> 00:42:33.084]  And you would have seen Mexico enter the frame.
[00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:35.926]  And you would have seen Japan enter the frame.
[00:42:35.926 --> 00:42:38.668]  And you would have seen India enter the frame.
[00:42:38.668 --> 00:42:41.490]  And then everything else would have aligned.
[00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:44.432]  And we could have not had a total financial collapse in the West.
[00:42:45.776 --> 00:42:47.478]  That would have crushed us.
[00:42:47.478 --> 00:42:53.105]  And we could have had a world design and free market based on free trade and fair trade practices.
[00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:58.292]  But instead now China is at the head of the table and Joe Biden is on the ground begging for breadcrumbs.
[00:43:02.574 --> 00:43:06.897]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[00:43:06.897 --> 00:43:12.461]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[00:43:12.461 --> 00:43:21.427]  But thank God that we have you, all of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.
[00:43:21.427 --> 00:43:26.090]  It's your love, our love, that makes all of this possible.
[00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:37.137]  And if you feel like showing us some love today and help keep us on the air, you can do so at infowarestore.com.
[00:43:37.137 --> 00:43:45.164]  Products that will make your life better and allow us to keep broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:48.707]  We are all in this together through thick and thin.
[00:43:48.707 --> 00:43:53.411]  On behalf of the whole crew, we love you and we thank you for your support.
[00:44:00.629 --> 00:44:07.556]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[00:44:07.556 --> 00:44:13.442]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[00:44:13.442 --> 00:44:19.789]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:27.335]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[00:44:27.335 --> 00:44:37.624]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[00:44:38.044 --> 00:44:47.050]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:53.634]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[00:44:53.634 --> 00:45:00.199]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfoWarsStore.com, where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[00:45:00.199 --> 00:45:00.659]  Look at that.
[00:45:01.374 --> 00:45:03.436]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[00:45:03.436 --> 00:45:06.058]  That's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[00:45:06.058 --> 00:45:08.460]  We didn't do that.
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.984]  You think I would metaphysically sell you something that is the very best I can get?
[00:45:12.984 --> 00:45:15.206]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[00:45:15.206 --> 00:45:24.254]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:26.016]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[00:45:26.016 --> 00:45:27.056]  Don't you get the big secret?
[00:45:27.777 --> 00:45:30.298]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:32.199]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[00:45:32.199 --> 00:45:42.645]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.
[00:45:42.645 --> 00:45:44.206]  Look it up!
[00:45:44.206 --> 00:45:44.646]  Find out!
[00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:50.197]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[00:45:50.197 --> 00:45:55.527]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[00:45:55.527 --> 00:45:58.632]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products and forestore.com.
[00:46:00.228 --> 00:46:07.252]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[00:46:07.252 --> 00:46:12.434]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[00:46:12.434 --> 00:46:19.458]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[00:46:19.458 --> 00:46:22.640]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.683]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:27.683 --> 00:46:34.128]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[00:46:34.128 --> 00:46:41.553]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[00:46:41.553 --> 00:46:44.795]  Now, with free shipping.
[00:46:44.795 --> 00:46:47.077]  We thank you for your support.
[00:46:47.077 --> 00:46:51.040]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[00:47:01.098 --> 00:47:05.700]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:11.461]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.461 --> 00:47:25.186]  All right, we got more clown behavior from the Biden administration today.
[00:47:31.209 --> 00:47:44.612]  But I'll leave my coverage of the Griner swap as it is, but just re-emphasize that the U.S.
[00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:49.573]  right now is getting lapped on the world stage.
[00:47:49.573 --> 00:47:57.615]  We're getting embarrassed, we're losing respect, and it's just something that you can't really conceive, we don't really understand yet.
[00:47:59.261 --> 00:48:25.901]  But just look at your inner cities, look at the inflation, look at the coming recession, look at the joke of the leadership, look at the military prioritizing trans sex activities and puppy dog kinks, look at the head of the nuclear waste of the Department of Energy, a puppy kink guy who gets caught stealing and hosts puppy kink seminars on how to spank your puppy lover.
[00:48:27.114 --> 00:48:32.118]  And the White House still won't fire him from his job, even after he gets caught stealing.
[00:48:32.118 --> 00:48:34.800]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.661]  And so, the U.S.
[00:48:36.661 --> 00:48:38.362]  is now the laughingstock of the world.
[00:48:38.362 --> 00:48:43.066]  World leaders don't understand why we're suiciding ourselves.
[00:48:43.066 --> 00:48:54.614]  And here we are, just observing it all, not understanding the repercussions of the current political times we're living through.
[00:48:56.147 --> 00:49:08.049]  I'd love to see America rise out of this like the Phoenix, and I think the world would too, but we got another two years of this clown show in the White House, and so it ain't happening anytime soon, folks.
[00:49:08.049 --> 00:49:11.190]  It's only gonna get worse.
[00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:20.092]  But I'm gonna move on from that now, and start getting into some other news, but ladies and gentlemen, remember,

[00:50:08.988 --> 00:50:10.009]  Great drink mix.
[00:50:10.009 --> 00:50:11.029]  I drink it every morning.
[00:50:11.029 --> 00:50:13.031]  So does a lot of the crew.

[00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:10.917]  And it's your support there that keeps us on the air.
[00:51:10.917 --> 00:51:13.038]  All right, what is the Biden administration up to?
[00:51:13.038 --> 00:51:19.179]  We're going to play some of these Kareem Jean-Pierre clips, but there was a Border Patrol agent killed yesterday, another one killed.
[00:51:21.434 --> 00:51:38.985]  After chasing in pursuit another illegal immigrant transfer into the United States, another coyote, another human trafficker, and was involved in an ATV accident and lost his life.
[00:51:38.985 --> 00:51:42.707]  And of course, what has the Biden administration said about this publicly?
[00:51:42.707 --> 00:51:44.788]  Nothing.
[00:51:44.788 --> 00:51:47.190]  Nothing.
[00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.490]  Nothing.
[00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:57.512]  The only use that Border Patrol has to this Biden administration is to human traffic their products into the country.
[00:51:57.512 --> 00:52:05.757]  Human traffic little boys and little girls into sex slavery, which happened in the Obama years, now is happening even worse in the Biden years.
[00:52:05.757 --> 00:52:08.758]  It was on record in the Obama years mainstream news.
[00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:09.679]  They talked about it.
[00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:11.640]  Now, though, they just bury it.
[00:52:13.083 --> 00:52:14.164]  But it'll be the big story.
[00:52:14.164 --> 00:52:15.705]  Eventually it's going to catch up.
[00:52:15.705 --> 00:52:20.509]  You know, you're not going to human traffic little boys and little girls into sex slavery forever and get away with it, right?
[00:52:20.509 --> 00:52:21.410]  You know that.
[00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.511]  And the Border Patrol knows that.
[00:52:22.511 --> 00:52:24.872]  That's why they feel so bad about what's going on.
[00:52:24.872 --> 00:52:26.354]  I feel bad for the Border Patrol.
[00:52:26.354 --> 00:52:27.194]  I'm not blaming them.
[00:52:27.194 --> 00:52:28.595]  I don't know how any of them are still working.
[00:52:28.595 --> 00:52:31.658]  I wouldn't work for the Border Patrol anymore.
[00:52:31.658 --> 00:52:35.441]  You're just a human trafficking government operation now.
[00:52:35.441 --> 00:52:36.682]  It's not a knock on the agents.
[00:52:36.682 --> 00:52:38.824]  They know it's true more than anybody.
[00:52:38.824 --> 00:52:39.304]  I've met them.
[00:52:39.304 --> 00:52:39.884]  I've talked to them.
[00:52:39.884 --> 00:52:41.406]  They're afraid to even talk about it.
[00:52:44.275 --> 00:52:45.636]  Border Patrol agent killed.
[00:52:45.636 --> 00:52:47.116]  38 years old.
[00:52:47.116 --> 00:52:51.799]  I believe left two kids behind.
[00:52:51.799 --> 00:52:57.321]  Killed in pursuit of a human trafficker and the Biden administration says nothing.
[00:52:57.321 --> 00:52:58.902]  Says zero.
[00:52:58.902 --> 00:52:59.723]  Zilch.
[00:52:59.723 --> 00:53:00.323]  Nada.
[00:53:00.323 --> 00:53:02.924]  Biden goes to Arizona.
[00:53:02.924 --> 00:53:04.605]  Doesn't even go to the border and he's asked why.
[00:53:04.605 --> 00:53:07.006]  He says because it's not a problem.
[00:53:07.006 --> 00:53:08.127]  Oh, it's not a problem.
[00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:13.022]  Five million illegal immigrants since Biden has been in office.
[00:53:13.022 --> 00:53:18.925]  Hundreds of thousands of little boys and girls human trafficked into sex slavery and raped.
[00:53:18.925 --> 00:53:19.805]  Thanks, Joe.
[00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:21.245]  Thanks, Democrats.
[00:53:21.245 --> 00:53:23.886]  I want you to think about that.
[00:53:23.886 --> 00:53:31.369]  All those Democrat voters and Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, just think about all the little boys and girls being tortured right now as sex slaves.
[00:53:31.369 --> 00:53:32.370]  They have you to thank for it.
[00:53:33.416 --> 00:53:38.077]  And when the Border Patrol agent dies, you don't say anything because you don't want people to know what's going on at the border.
[00:53:38.077 --> 00:53:39.057]  That's what it's really about.
[00:53:39.057 --> 00:53:43.398]  Oh, there's more important things in the border, says Joe Biden.
[00:53:43.398 --> 00:53:44.118]  Right, right.
[00:53:44.118 --> 00:53:46.999]  Because you don't want people to see what's going on down there, huh?
[00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:47.919]  Yeah.
[00:53:47.919 --> 00:53:55.661]  You don't want people to see the footage of the little boys and girls where they're talking to reporters saying, yeah, I came here in an unaccompanied minor, now I'm a sex slave.
[00:53:55.661 --> 00:53:59.062]  They don't want you to see that.
[00:53:59.062 --> 00:54:00.402]  They don't want you to see that.
[00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:03.732]  I hope all you libs, because I know you're tuned in.
[00:54:03.732 --> 00:54:07.616]  That's what's so incredible about this platform is that all the liberals tune in too.
[00:54:07.616 --> 00:54:09.777]  I know all you liberals are tuned in.
[00:54:09.777 --> 00:54:12.680]  I want you to think about that when you lay down to sleep tonight.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:18.104]  All those innocent little boys and girls that are being tortured and raped because of you.
[00:54:18.104 --> 00:54:19.666]  That feel good?
[00:54:19.666 --> 00:54:20.887]  Hope that feels nice.
[00:54:20.887 --> 00:54:23.649]  Hope it feels as nice as it does for them.
[00:54:23.649 --> 00:54:26.071]  You did it!
[00:54:26.071 --> 00:54:26.992]  You have done it!
[00:54:28.424 --> 00:54:37.753]  Congratulations, you have opened up the largest child sex trafficking ring in United States history when you voted for Biden and ignored the open border.
[00:54:37.753 --> 00:54:39.475]  Way to go, Democrats.
[00:54:39.475 --> 00:54:42.498]  Way to go, liberals.
[00:54:42.498 --> 00:54:46.221]  What is more important that Joe Biden can't address the border?
[00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:49.184]  Joe Biden renews call for assault weapons ban.
[00:54:49.184 --> 00:54:49.905]  Ah, there it is.
[00:54:49.905 --> 00:54:51.706]  Taking your firearms is more important.
[00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:55.473]  Getting rid of the Second Amendment is more important.
[00:54:55.473 --> 00:55:00.416]  Disarming you and turning you into slaves is more important.
[00:55:00.416 --> 00:55:01.536]  Of course it is.
[00:55:01.536 --> 00:55:02.797]  The border's running just fine.
[00:55:02.797 --> 00:55:07.420]  They've got the largest human trafficking operation going on in American history down there at the border.
[00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.781]  That's exactly what they want.
[00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:12.703]  There's no need to address that.
[00:55:12.703 --> 00:55:14.344]  That's things going swimmingly.
[00:55:16.223 --> 00:55:19.224]  But you, the pesky Americans, still have a firearm.
[00:55:19.224 --> 00:55:21.706]  You, the pesky Americans, still have a Second Amendment right.
[00:55:21.706 --> 00:55:23.907]  That is a higher priority.
[00:55:23.907 --> 00:55:26.688]  To get rid of that is a higher priority.
[00:55:26.688 --> 00:55:32.051]  Alright, let's start getting into some of these crazy clips.
[00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:34.932]  From Crene Jean-Pierre.
[00:55:34.932 --> 00:55:36.414]  It's a total clown show.
[00:55:36.414 --> 00:55:37.856]  She's part of the circus.
[00:55:37.856 --> 00:55:40.259]  Crene Jean-Pierre here in clip three.
[00:55:40.259 --> 00:55:46.508]  They're all denying their involvement in the Twitter censorship, even though we have the emails and the phone calls and the whistleblowers.
[00:55:46.508 --> 00:55:51.174]  Here's Crene Jean-Pierre just lying to the American people, completely unashamed, in clip three.
[00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:55.438]  I'm wondering if there was that communication there surrounding the Hunter Biden laptop story.
[00:55:55.438 --> 00:56:00.343]  I can't speak to decisions made by the campaign from here.
[00:56:00.343 --> 00:56:06.008]  It is a political campaign, so I can't speak to that from here.
[00:56:06.008 --> 00:56:11.713]  I'm covered by the Hatch Act, and so I'm just not going to comment on the question that you're asking me.
[00:56:11.713 --> 00:56:13.054]  Oh, oh, oh.
[00:56:13.054 --> 00:56:14.215]  She's not going to comment.
[00:56:14.215 --> 00:56:14.936]  Isn't that funny?
[00:56:16.687 --> 00:56:20.090]  She says, well, that was when it was a political campaign.
[00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:25.094]  So even though she's refusing to answer, she just answered.
[00:56:25.094 --> 00:56:27.236]  Yeah, that was the Biden campaign that did that.
[00:56:27.236 --> 00:56:28.797]  Oops!
[00:56:28.797 --> 00:56:31.800]  Oops!
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.721]  Oops!
[00:56:32.721 --> 00:56:34.302]  Oh, I don't know anything about that.
[00:56:34.302 --> 00:56:35.944]  We have nothing to do with that.
[00:56:35.944 --> 00:56:38.546]  Oh, I had nothing to do with Joe Biden's campaign censoring on Twitter.
[00:56:38.546 --> 00:56:39.867]  I wasn't there then.
[00:56:39.867 --> 00:56:41.829]  Oh, oops!
[00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:43.750]  Oops!
[00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:44.111]  Hmm.
[00:56:45.464 --> 00:56:48.488]  Every once in a while they tell you the truth.
[00:56:48.488 --> 00:56:54.154]  Now this one, folks, as we go to break here, final segment of the hour, this is a belly laugher.
[00:56:54.154 --> 00:56:55.696]  Get ready for this one.
[00:56:55.696 --> 00:57:01.463]  Karine Jean-Pierre claims the Biden administration has been successful in lowering costs and fighting inflation.
[00:57:01.463 --> 00:57:01.824]  Here we go.
[00:57:04.215 --> 00:57:10.281]  Let me just say the vice president has been a great partner of the president this past two years.
[00:57:10.281 --> 00:57:24.196]  You know, the successes that they both have had in the clearly Biden-Harris administration on getting things done for the American people when it comes to the economy, when it comes to lowering costs, when it comes to fighting inflation.
[00:57:24.196 --> 00:57:26.017]  And that is something that we're going to continue to do.
[00:57:27.082 --> 00:57:28.163]  Let's play it again!
[00:57:28.163 --> 00:57:29.484]  Take it to break!
[00:57:29.484 --> 00:57:30.224]  Take it to break!
[00:57:30.224 --> 00:57:30.985]  I want to hear it again!
[00:57:30.985 --> 00:57:31.585]  I'm loving it!
[00:57:31.585 --> 00:57:32.265]  Go ahead!
[00:57:32.265 --> 00:57:35.327]  Let me just say, the Vice President has been a great partner.
[00:57:35.327 --> 00:57:37.068]  Oh, she's so great!
[00:57:37.068 --> 00:57:38.309]  What a partner!
[00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:41.051]  You know, the successes that they both have had... The successes!
[00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:42.232]  Both of them!
[00:57:42.232 --> 00:57:43.432]  Both of them!
[00:57:43.432 --> 00:57:46.434]  The list of Biden-Harris successes, folks, it's so long!
[00:57:46.434 --> 00:57:46.675]  Oh, man!
[00:57:49.761 --> 00:57:58.586]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.

[00:58:46.393 --> 00:58:49.955]  InfoWars.com.
[00:58:49.955 --> 00:58:52.176]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[00:58:52.176 --> 00:58:56.198]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[00:58:56.198 --> 00:58:57.518]  There's a solution.
[00:58:57.518 --> 00:58:58.499]  The Wellness Company.
[00:58:58.499 --> 00:59:07.243]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer, and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[00:59:07.563 --> 00:59:09.264]  Doctors on demand.

[00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:36.800]  Thank you.
[01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:12.113]  Is the sun rising or setting on the American way of life?
[01:00:12.113 --> 01:00:13.574]  Or returning to it?
[01:00:13.574 --> 01:00:14.094]  Alright.
[01:00:14.094 --> 01:00:18.838]  You know, it wouldn't be so funny if they weren't destroying our country and destroying our future.
[01:00:20.177 --> 01:00:25.839]  Turning America into a third world hellhole, where we're all just going to be treated like commodities.
[01:00:25.839 --> 01:00:27.560]  But I mean, come on.
[01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.261]  It's so good, I almost want to play it a third time.
[01:00:30.261 --> 01:00:38.125]  Karine Jean-Pierre telling you how much of a success Biden and Harris have been, specifically at lowering costs and fighting inflation.
[01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:43.047]  I mean, those are like... That's like the two things that obviously are not going well.
[01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:57.770]  The two things that are obviously, universally, subjectively not going well, and she sits up there with a straight face, and I mean, honestly, this is a spectacle.
[01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:58.551]  This is a spectacle.
[01:00:58.551 --> 01:00:59.312]  I want to play it again.
[01:00:59.312 --> 01:01:05.779]  This is, this, this, this behavior needs to be studied throughout human history.
[01:01:07.426 --> 01:01:12.570]  How somebody can get up there and just blatantly lie to you with a straight face.
[01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:15.012]  It's an amazing psychological phenomenon.
[01:01:15.012 --> 01:01:15.692]  It truly is.
[01:01:15.692 --> 01:01:21.476]  I mean, I'm sitting here as a student of human psychology and I'm just enamored at this.
[01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:23.898]  And so maybe I shouldn't because it's kind of a personal thing.
[01:01:23.898 --> 01:01:26.660]  But listen, I mean, this is truly a spectacle.
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.562]  Here's Karine Jean-Pierre.
[01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:33.450]  I'm telling the American people who are all paying more money.
[01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.112]  Grocery bill is up.
[01:01:35.112 --> 01:01:36.653]  Electricity bill is up.
[01:01:36.653 --> 01:01:38.835]  Gas bill is up.
[01:01:38.835 --> 01:01:40.477]  The inflation is 10%.
[01:01:40.477 --> 01:01:42.118]  They just dropped a new number, actually.
[01:01:42.118 --> 01:01:42.659]  It was 10%.
[01:01:42.659 --> 01:01:46.182]  Now it's down to like 9.8 or something.
[01:01:46.182 --> 01:01:48.344]  It was like 1% when Trump was in.
[01:01:48.344 --> 01:01:52.068]  Now it's pushing double digits all the time.
[01:01:52.068 --> 01:01:53.369]  And everybody feels it.
[01:01:53.369 --> 01:01:54.170]  Everybody knows it.
[01:01:55.154 --> 01:01:59.037]  And then there's Kamala Harris, I mean, what does she even do?
[01:01:59.037 --> 01:02:00.959]  Nobody even knows what she does.
[01:02:00.959 --> 01:02:16.953]  And then, this is truly, folks, I mean, let's just soak in the incredible psychological phenomenon of this is either massive pathological lying, or these are just the most corrupt propaganda liars in the history of the United States of America.
[01:02:16.953 --> 01:02:19.635]  Either way, this is historical stuff.
[01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:21.057]  This is truly historical stuff.
[01:02:22.543 --> 01:02:34.795]  So here's Jean Pierre, the Press Secretary of the White House, to the American people who are all paying more for gas, more for electricity, more for groceries, and she's about to tell you that none of that is happening.
[01:02:34.795 --> 01:02:35.056]  Play it.
[01:02:35.595 --> 01:02:41.658]  Let me just say, the Vice President has been a great partner of the President for the past two years.
[01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:45.199]  You know, the successes that they both have had.
[01:02:45.199 --> 01:02:55.564]  Clearly, Biden-Harris administration on getting things done for the American people when it comes to the economy, when it comes to lowering costs, when it comes to fighting inflation.
[01:02:55.564 --> 01:02:57.284]  And that is something that we're going to continue to do.
[01:02:57.284 --> 01:02:58.185]  Wow.
[01:02:58.185 --> 01:02:58.485]  Wow.
[01:03:00.097 --> 01:03:01.298]  Folks, that's an all-timer.
[01:03:01.298 --> 01:03:06.661]  I mean, honestly, put that down, download that, that's all-time history right there.
[01:03:06.661 --> 01:03:13.106]  That's a clip that people will be playing for decades as an example of the biggest liars in U.S.
[01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:13.606]  history.
[01:03:13.606 --> 01:03:17.529]  That is a clip that we will remember and play for decades.
[01:03:19.151 --> 01:03:22.773]  As one of the top moments of US propaganda.
[01:03:22.773 --> 01:03:32.179]  Karine Jean-Pierre says, the successes of the Biden-Harris administration, and then says lowering cost and lowering inflation, the exact opposite of the reality.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:48.349]  The Biden-Harris administration, if known for anything, is going to be known for the high, record high inflation, and the record high producer price index, and the record high consumer price index, and Karine Jean-Pierre sits up there and tells you the exact opposite.
[01:03:49.474 --> 01:03:53.337]  Sure, I mean, look.
[01:03:53.337 --> 01:04:05.104]  Aside from the fact that I'm an American suffering under this faux regime, I, as a student of psychology, that is amazing.
[01:04:05.104 --> 01:04:10.628]  It's like, have you ever seen the movie Shutter Island?
[01:04:10.628 --> 01:04:12.950]  Great film.
[01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:16.272]  And I don't want to do a spoiler, but when one of the patients
[01:04:17.603 --> 01:04:31.955]  It's a mental patient facility and when one of the mental patients is walking around in the room full of doctors exhibiting his mental disorder behavior, the doctor is sitting in his leather chair leaning back and he's just like, outstanding!
[01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:32.815]  Fantastic!
[01:04:33.556 --> 01:04:35.878]  And you watch it the first time and you're like, what is he talking about?
[01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:37.520]  Why does he keep saying this stuff?
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.563]  But then you realize, he's truly enamored by this human psychology.
[01:04:41.563 --> 01:04:45.948]  He's truly enamored by this anomaly of a human that has all these mental problems.
[01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:46.768]  That's like the same thing.
[01:04:46.768 --> 01:04:49.291]  We're like, I'm just sitting here completely astounded.
[01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:55.837]  Karine Jean-Pierre is such an unashamed, blatant liar.
[01:04:55.837 --> 01:04:56.958]  It's fantastical.
[01:05:02.243 --> 01:05:06.565]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[01:05:06.565 --> 01:05:12.127]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[01:05:12.127 --> 01:05:21.090]  But thank God that we have you, all of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.
[01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:25.752]  It's your love, our love, that makes all of this possible.

[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:53.064]  On behalf of the whole crew, we love you and we thank you for your support.
[01:06:09.955 --> 01:06:11.636]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:11.636 --> 01:06:13.337]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.278 --> 01:06:18.339]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:20.149 --> 01:06:45.832]  So when I found out I was doing double duty today I thought who's a great guest that I can get on so that people don't have to listen to me all day and immediately I thought about Darren Beattie not even because there was some big developments in the news that he's been covering just because he's always on top of the stories with Revolver.News but then there is now there are actually big developments in the January 6th news realm and we'll be getting into some of that with
[01:06:46.272 --> 01:06:47.573]  Darren Beattie here today.
[01:06:47.573 --> 01:06:49.434]  But Darren, let me do this.
[01:06:49.434 --> 01:06:59.360]  Let me do a follow-up of where we last left off, because you've broken so many huge stories at revolver.news, specifically following the January 6th story.
[01:07:00.509 --> 01:07:14.198]  And so let me just ask you this, since we last spoke, when you broke the news, I mean, you would probably say you're 99% confident in the fact that somebody tampered with the video evidence of the January 6th pipe bomber.
[01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:26.566]  Now we have this geofencing story that came out in Wired, where they're bragging how effective their geofencing is in regards to finding all the January 6th defendants, but yet they can't find the pipe bomber.
[01:07:26.566 --> 01:07:30.249]  So I'm just curious, since you broke that huge story of the video
[01:07:30.469 --> 01:07:32.950]  You know, that's a great question.
[01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:39.214]  And of course, a lot of people in sort of independent media, conservative media, they have taken an interest and they have covered it.
[01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:10.652]  So I did a whole hour long phone call getting into the full range of discrepancies pertaining to the pipe bomb with Norbin Laden, which was very good.
[01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:19.341]  And my understanding is Glenn Beck dedicated a whole show basically based on Revolver News' coverage.
[01:08:19.341 --> 01:08:24.826]  And so we've had a lot of pundits and sort of conservative commentators
[01:08:25.592 --> 01:08:31.974]  Um, come around to covering the story, which is good, but, you know, that's really not enough.
[01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:47.219]  And, you know, just to put a stark point on it, one of our earlier pieces, we proved definitively that the FBI was withholding footage that would have shown the pipe bomber actually planting the bomb at the DNC.
[01:08:48.197 --> 01:09:11.865]  Now, this would be great footage to see because one of the really bizarre features of the January 6th official story with the pipe bomber is that this DNC bomb was allegedly planted at the DNC headquarters the evening before, so January 5th around 8 p.m., and then we're supposed to believe that it was just sitting there for 17 hours.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:23.503]  Out there, right in its open, conspicuous position, laying right out there for all to see, by the foot of a bench.
[01:09:23.503 --> 01:09:35.226]  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't suggest anybody do this, but my guess is, if you tried to repeat that scenario, if somebody went and left a strange package outside the DNC, there's no way it sits out there for almost a full day.
[01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.773]  Well, well, Owen, it's not even a hypothetical.
[01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:47.076]  We had, you know, one of our many pieces on this, we did a walkthrough to sort of reconstruct the path.
[01:09:47.076 --> 01:10:00.060]  And it's really funny, like our guy who I guess will remain nameless, but we had somebody do the walkthrough, and literally the second he was there, the security came up to him and said, what are you doing here?
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.061]  Blah, blah, blah, started harassing him.
[01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:05.502]  It was technically, you know, that's public, that's a public area.
[01:10:06.464 --> 01:10:11.116]  We also found through the use of Google Satellite imagery
[01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:21.158]  That the DNC had a physical security guard regularly stationed nearly eight feet away from where the pipe bomb was planted.
[01:10:21.158 --> 01:10:39.167]  And so it just compounds discrepancy upon bizarre and almost unbelievable coincidence until there's so many piled on top of one another that it becomes simply unbelievable that this DNC pipe bomb was sitting there for 17 hours.
[01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:41.048]  The DNC security guard that
[01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:42.490]  We're good to go.
[01:10:59.023 --> 01:11:06.252]  It was covered up for over a year, but now we know that Kamala Harris was in the DNC building while the pipe bomb was sitting there.
[01:11:06.252 --> 01:11:12.060]  The Secret Service is on record saying they swept all exits and entrances.
[01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:13.582]  The pipe bomb was planted again.
[01:11:14.062 --> 01:11:20.324]  Less than 10 feet away from the parking garage entrance and exits, which the Secret Service claimed that they swept.
[01:11:20.324 --> 01:11:22.424]  And the Secret Service managed to miss it.
[01:11:22.424 --> 01:11:24.725]  So were all of these people missing it?
[01:11:24.725 --> 01:11:29.826]  And then on top of that, we said, well, was it actually planted there when they said it was?
[01:11:29.826 --> 01:11:42.049]  And that's the one piece of money-shot footage that the FBI just happened to censor from the footage that it released to the public with no explanation.
[01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:46.810]  And so just getting back to what you're saying, like, are people picking up on the story?
[01:11:46.810 --> 01:12:10.138]  I think it's very weird, frankly, and even a little bit damning that the Democrats themselves aren't joining the chorus, aren't joining Revolver to say, wait a minute, this is a, from their point of view, MAGA pipe bomber terrorist who planted an explosive device outside of their national headquarters.
[01:12:10.965 --> 01:12:16.109]  You would think that they would be more interested in uncovering who this person actually is.
[01:12:16.109 --> 01:12:19.271]  Yeah, I mean, you scowl at a Democrat.
[01:12:19.271 --> 01:12:21.253]  You scowl at a Democrat, they call you a terrorist.
[01:12:21.253 --> 01:12:26.016]  This guy actually puts a bomb outside their headquarters and they don't even buzz about it.
[01:12:26.016 --> 01:12:26.797]  They don't care.
[01:12:26.797 --> 01:12:31.420]  They're not joining me and asking the FBI to release the footage.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.641]  And here's the thing is that
[01:12:33.570 --> 01:12:39.831]  You know, the Fed's erection thesis is a, I mean, I think it's 100% correct.
[01:12:39.831 --> 01:12:57.514]  I think anyone who has doubts should just read our stories on it, but it's difficult politically unless you are a hero, unless you're a firebrand, unless you're one of the warriors like, you know, Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene or Paul Gosar or Thomas Massey.
[01:12:57.514 --> 01:13:00.755]  Not everyone can get away with
[01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:02.087]  That's right.
[01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.797]  This person was a terrorist.
[01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:25.178]  I'll even pay lip service to the idea it was a MAGA terrorist.
[01:13:25.178 --> 01:13:27.038]  But we condemn terrorism.
[01:13:27.038 --> 01:13:28.979]  We're a law and order party.
[01:13:28.979 --> 01:13:36.861]  And we call on the Democrats to join us in getting the full, unedited, raw footage of this terrorist pipe bomber.
[01:13:36.861 --> 01:13:41.082]  Because the entire nation has an interest in uncovering who this person is.
[01:13:41.702 --> 01:13:44.384]  You don't have to say it was a fedsurrection, anything.
[01:13:44.384 --> 01:13:52.710]  You just have to say this is the most terrorist-like aspect of the day that the Democrats are comparing to 9-11.
[01:13:52.710 --> 01:14:08.661]  Why don't we get to the bottom of it and at the very least have the chain of custody of the footage and the full and unedited footage so that we can get to the business of finding out who this guy or woman or sort of ambiguous in-between might be.
[01:14:09.642 --> 01:14:25.358]  Well, and I kind of look at this the same way I look at the QAnon thing, where they love to use the pipe bomber, they love to use QAnon when they can kind of fit it into their narrative and use it to build a narrative or move the narrative along, but when it comes to genuine interest, it's just not there.
[01:14:25.678 --> 01:14:26.399]  It's just not there.
[01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:28.361]  They don't really seem to care who QAnon is.
[01:14:28.361 --> 01:14:30.304]  They claim he led this big revolution.
[01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:31.625]  They don't claim to care.
[01:14:31.625 --> 01:14:32.646]  They're not investigating.
[01:14:32.646 --> 01:14:33.948]  They're not asking the questions.
[01:14:33.948 --> 01:14:35.270]  They're not digging into that.
[01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.731]  Same thing with the pipe bomber.
[01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:37.672]  They're not digging into it.
[01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:39.455]  They're not asking the main questions.
[01:14:39.455 --> 01:14:40.696]  Obviously, they're not trying to find him.
[01:14:40.696 --> 01:14:42.318]  They didn't even do the geofencing.
[01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:44.220]  So to me, I just sit here and I say, hmm, okay.
[01:14:45.017 --> 01:14:48.000]  You don't want to go after QAnon, probably one of your own.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.163]  You don't want to go after the Pipe Bomber, probably one of your own.
[01:14:51.163 --> 01:14:53.505]  That's my opinion, not Darren's.
[01:14:53.505 --> 01:14:56.508]  But what are you making out of all of this, from covering all that?
[01:14:56.508 --> 01:15:01.332]  How do you even make sense of the lack of interest in the DC Pipe Bomber?
[01:15:01.332 --> 01:15:04.295]  Well, I mean, again, it looks very weird.
[01:15:04.295 --> 01:15:07.698]  And I'll tell you a story about the geofencing, because, you know,
[01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:28.357]  I'm not an idiot, like the idea occurred to me, why don't I, you know, try to replicate the, you know, 2000 mules strategy and do some geofencing on my own, because there are a handful of sort of data service companies from which, in theory, you can purchase that information.
[01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:31.898]  You don't have to be a government actor.
[01:15:31.898 --> 01:15:38.302]  Governments are the primary clients of these services, but it's not a law that they can only do business with the government.
[01:15:38.302 --> 01:15:41.944]  In fact, in many cases they do do business in the private sector.
[01:15:41.944 --> 01:15:48.848]  And so I knew that as a known quantity, they're probably not going to want to deal with Darren Beattie.
[01:15:48.848 --> 01:15:50.629]  Alright, we've got to take a break.
[01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:52.410]  This is so key though, when we come back.
[01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:57.473]  Because folks, they're bragging about how effective the geofencing is to get J6 defendants, but why didn't it get the pipe bomber?
[01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:07.677]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:16:07.677 --> 01:16:11.519]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[01:16:11.519 --> 01:16:20.585]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[01:16:20.585 --> 01:16:22.647]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[01:16:23.387 --> 01:16:26.830]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[01:16:26.830 --> 01:16:28.271]  This is a game changer.
[01:16:28.271 --> 01:16:29.832]  We're so excited about it.
[01:16:29.832 --> 01:16:32.094]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[01:16:32.094 --> 01:16:36.517]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[01:16:36.517 --> 01:16:39.639]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:42.081]  The same great customer service and more.
[01:16:42.081 --> 01:16:47.805]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at infowarestore.com right now.
[01:16:48.746 --> 01:16:56.313]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:16:58.777 --> 01:17:10.264]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:17:10.264 --> 01:17:14.726]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:17:14.726 --> 01:17:18.688]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:17:18.688 --> 01:17:23.131]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:17:23.131 --> 01:17:24.192]  You see, the sun
[01:17:24.872 --> 01:17:25.092]  I think?
[01:17:48.379 --> 01:17:48.860]  We're good.
[01:17:58.809 --> 01:18:10.295]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[01:18:10.295 --> 01:18:14.757]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[01:18:14.757 --> 01:18:18.659]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[01:18:19.099 --> 01:18:23.141]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[01:18:23.141 --> 01:18:29.203]  You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:33.085]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[01:18:33.085 --> 01:18:37.827]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[01:18:37.827 --> 01:18:42.589]  So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high quality vitamin D3.
[01:18:42.589 --> 01:18:47.692]  And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off.
[01:18:48.852 --> 01:18:52.636]  At InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[01:18:52.636 --> 01:18:53.317]  Don't wait!
[01:18:53.317 --> 01:18:57.621]  Support the InfoWar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:18:58.749 --> 01:19:10.074]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:19:10.074 --> 01:19:11.975]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:19:11.975 --> 01:19:13.436]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:19:13.436 --> 01:19:14.937]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:19:14.937 --> 01:19:16.638]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:19:16.638 --> 01:19:17.918]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:19:17.918 --> 01:19:19.319]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:19:19.739 --> 01:19:24.582]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:19:24.582 --> 01:19:26.984]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:19:26.984 --> 01:19:29.005]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:19:29.005 --> 01:19:35.950]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:41.976]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:19:41.976 --> 01:19:50.925]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:19:50.925 --> 01:19:57.192]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:05.010]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:06.334]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:35.037]  Dr. Darren Beattie is with us from revolver.news, truly one of the great groundbreaking websites of the modern day, truly emerging as one of the greats, as is Darren Beattie.
[01:20:35.037 --> 01:20:51.107]  And Darren was just getting into how they were running some real world human intelligence down in DC in regards to this geofencing story, so people understand, they brag in Wired Magazine and all these leftist publications about their geofencing
[01:20:52.654 --> 01:21:06.163]  Abilities to track and trace and get data on all these January 6th defendants, and they brag how they can pick one out of a crowd of millions on a day where there was no service, and magically they can use this technology, find all these J6 defendants.
[01:21:06.163 --> 01:21:16.270]  But when it's the pipe bomber, a crowd of one in a crowd of one, alone in a night out in front of the DNC on camera, they can't seem to find that.
[01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:18.671]  So Darren was getting into that before we took the break.
[01:21:18.671 --> 01:21:19.572]  Darren, let's pick it up.
[01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:21.732]  Absolutely.
[01:21:21.732 --> 01:21:32.224]  So as I was saying, I tried to avail myself of the geofencing technology and it is available to the private citizens.
[01:21:32.224 --> 01:21:38.751]  It's more controlled, but there are a handful of companies that have this data and they can sell it if they want to.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:22:01.017]  And knowing that I was kind of a public quantity and I might not have success approaching them as myself, I had a friend, a proxy who's done business with them before, go and say, hey, you know, not much information on the political implications of the data, but just we'd like
[01:22:02.038 --> 01:22:11.344]  Um, to, you know, explore the possibility of getting, you know, your geofencing data for, you know, this general area, this general time.
[01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:18.448]  And the initial response in, uh, two cases was, Oh, this, this sounds great.
[01:22:18.448 --> 01:22:20.029]  You know, it shouldn't be a problem.
[01:22:20.029 --> 01:22:22.130]  Happy to do business.
[01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:27.854]  Then the next day, and one case the same day, we get a follow-up message saying,
[01:22:28.775 --> 01:22:33.418]  Basically, sorry, this isn't something we can work on.
[01:22:33.418 --> 01:22:35.439]  No further explanation.
[01:22:35.439 --> 01:22:38.862]  So, yeah, I don't know, again, what to make of that.
[01:22:38.862 --> 01:22:50.189]  But, like, assuming that they did discover the political significance of this, you'd think that one of these sort of data collection firms would be thrilled
[01:22:51.098 --> 01:22:56.460]  To participate in a project that would uncover who this pipe bomber terrorist was.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.661]  Wouldn't they be lauded as a hero?
[01:22:58.661 --> 01:23:05.683]  Wouldn't they get great publicity for playing a decisive role in figuring out who this person is?
[01:23:05.683 --> 01:23:08.844]  Wouldn't the FBI give them a medal?
[01:23:08.844 --> 01:23:09.584]  You know?
[01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:13.006]  And for some reason, they didn't think that would be the case.
[01:23:13.006 --> 01:23:19.688]  And maybe, whatever reason that is, it's the same reason that the Democrats aren't joining me and saying, hey FBI,
[01:23:20.268 --> 01:23:29.071]  Why don't you release the footage of the alleged MAGA pipe bomber actually planting the bomb outside of the DNC headquarters?
[01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:34.734]  Maybe that's the same reason the Democrats don't seem to be interested in finding out who this is.
[01:23:34.734 --> 01:23:39.235]  And why, basically, the public face... Here's another thing, Owen.
[01:23:39.235 --> 01:23:45.778]  The public face of the pipe bomb investigation at the FBI, someone called Steven DiAntonio,
[01:23:47.162 --> 01:23:57.148]  His previous job was running the Detroit field office in the FBI where he oversaw the Michigan Fednapping plot disaster.
[01:23:57.148 --> 01:24:07.655]  It's literally that guy who after the suspected Whitmer kidnappers were arrested, the day after Christopher Wray propelled him to this coveted
[01:24:08.275 --> 01:24:20.182]  Post at the DC field office when he went on to oversee things in the months leading up to and on January 6, then became the public face of the pipe bomb investigation.
[01:24:20.182 --> 01:24:23.204]  This position he had at the Washington field office.
[01:24:23.784 --> 01:24:28.406]  That, according to FBI sources, is in a highly coveted position.
[01:24:28.406 --> 01:24:38.930]  It's something that McCabe had, for instance, that is almost always a stepping stone for climbers into the coveted seventh floor at the Hoover Building.
[01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:44.572]  And the fact that he quietly and suspiciously retires from this key post
[01:24:45.192 --> 01:24:59.377]  In the same way that he was quietly and suspiciously propelled to it from his job in Michigan, where he oversaw the infiltration operation of the Whitmer thing, it's really bizarre.
[01:24:59.377 --> 01:25:09.640]  And again, there are too many coincidences here, too much damning information, too many glaring discrepancies with zero explanation.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.901]  And we know for a fact
[01:25:11.894 --> 01:25:22.986]  The footage released by the FBI to the public was both censored by withholding the critical footage of the pipe bomber planting the bomb and tampered with.
[01:25:22.986 --> 01:25:28.091]  They reduced the frame rate to a rate of 1.2 frames per second, which is unheard of.
[01:25:28.091 --> 01:25:32.436]  And just to put a capstone on it, one reason they may be interested in
[01:25:33.617 --> 01:25:49.424]  Lowering the frame rate artificially is that with a higher frame rate, you'll be able to see very clearly that the pipe bomber was using his or her phone and texting continuously, which would have established a narrative that there was a third party involved.
[01:25:49.424 --> 01:25:51.605]  And then the question, who was this third party?
[01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:55.387]  And also would make it very clear that, okay, it was using a phone.
[01:25:55.387 --> 01:25:56.948]  Why don't you use geofencing?
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:09.323]  Well, it sounds to me, the conclusion that I reach based off of what you just said, it's not that there's a lack of interest in finding the pipe bomber.
[01:26:09.323 --> 01:26:12.824]  They know something that we don't know about the pipe bomber.
[01:26:12.824 --> 01:26:15.705]  I mean, that's clearly what this says to me.
[01:26:15.705 --> 01:26:28.329]  Especially, I mean, it sounds to me, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but just listening to this story, it sounds to me like somebody behind the scenes got wind of you looking for this geofencing data, and somebody in a real powerful position shut that down.
[01:26:30.202 --> 01:26:31.224]  That's possible.
[01:26:31.224 --> 01:26:43.743]  Or the geofencing people looked into it a little bit further and they just, you know, people in these industries, they develop certain sensitivities as to where they're allowed to go and where they're not allowed to go.
[01:26:43.743 --> 01:26:45.346]  And maybe it was just that they sensed
[01:26:46.289 --> 01:26:48.371]  You know, they didn't want to get involved.
[01:26:48.371 --> 01:26:51.954]  Maybe they had the right intuitions about what was really going on.
[01:26:51.954 --> 01:26:52.654]  I don't know.
[01:26:52.654 --> 01:27:07.307]  All I know is that multiple cases, and there are only a handful of these firms that I approached through a proxy who is not a political quantity whatsoever, someone that they should have been extremely comfortable doing business with.
[01:27:07.307 --> 01:27:10.049]  They got an initial very warm response.
[01:27:10.049 --> 01:27:11.190]  Yes, shouldn't be a problem.
[01:27:11.190 --> 01:27:12.471]  And then shortly after,
[01:27:12.932 --> 01:27:21.316]  In one case, on the same day, there was a complete about face saying, you know what, sorry, we can't touch this, basically, with no further explanation.
[01:27:21.316 --> 01:27:35.542]  And again, in light of all the other data points, all the other glaring discrepancies, all the other burning and really dark questions surrounding the pipe bomb issue in particular, it really doesn't paint a rosy picture as far as
[01:27:36.371 --> 01:27:50.722]  What Merrick Garland was up to, what Christopher Wray is up to, and what the disgraced and now recently resigned Steve Indiantuono was up to after having run the Fednapping entrapment operation in Michigan.
[01:27:51.986 --> 01:28:03.134]  Well, and maybe the people that you reached out to for this geofencing data, maybe they're aware of when you cross the Democrat Party, a lot of times you end up in a casket.
[01:28:03.134 --> 01:28:04.314]  Just ask Elon Musk.
[01:28:04.314 --> 01:28:09.758]  That's why he's telling people he's not suicidal right now, because he's aware of that trend.
[01:28:09.758 --> 01:28:11.579]  Darren, I'd like to get one more segment with you.
[01:28:11.579 --> 01:28:13.060]  We're about to hit this break.
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:15.502]  Any final words before we hit this break, if you can't stick around?
[01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:22.356]  Um, no, just, you know, go to revolver.news in the exclusive section.
[01:28:22.356 --> 01:28:26.041]  And if you're interested, read our, read our pieces on the pipe bomb.
[01:28:26.041 --> 01:28:32.269]  We have some really entertaining and fun and also informative videos illustrating the key theses.
[01:28:33.296 --> 01:28:42.161]  The public pressure is really our only leverage in this case.
[01:28:42.161 --> 01:28:49.184]  The politicians will only follow up on things insofar as they think there remains public interest.
[01:28:49.184 --> 01:28:59.089]  And from Merrick Garland's position, from Christopher Wray's position, the one thing that they're counting on is for us to just forget about it and move on to the next thing.
[01:28:59.582 --> 01:29:09.226]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.

[01:30:01.778 --> 01:30:06.100]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:11.663]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.

[01:30:47.912 --> 01:30:52.594]  On behalf of the whole crew, we love you and we thank you for your support.
[01:30:59.318 --> 01:31:05.295]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[01:31:06.610 --> 01:31:16.979]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[01:31:16.979 --> 01:31:29.729]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.990]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.930 --> 01:32:05.774]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:32:05.774 --> 01:32:12.198]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:32:12.198 --> 01:32:17.322]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:32:17.322 --> 01:32:19.023]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:32:19.023 --> 01:32:20.384]  Yes, I've persevered.
[01:32:20.384 --> 01:32:25.448]  But the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[01:32:26.168 --> 01:32:31.593]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:32:31.593 --> 01:32:35.576]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:32:35.576 --> 01:32:45.224]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:32:45.224 --> 01:32:46.505]  God bless you all.
[01:32:46.505 --> 01:32:47.545]  I salute you.
[01:32:47.545 --> 01:32:48.646]  I thank you.
[01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:53.991]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:32:54.651 --> 01:32:55.993]  The fight is my fight.
[01:32:55.993 --> 01:32:56.614]  It's your fight.
[01:32:56.614 --> 01:32:57.375]  It's our fight.
[01:32:57.375 --> 01:33:00.319]  God bless you all.
[01:33:00.319 --> 01:33:06.206]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:25.607]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.607 --> 01:33:28.851]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:30.862 --> 01:33:31.923]  Darren Beatty still with us.
[01:33:31.923 --> 01:33:32.563]  One more segment.
[01:33:32.563 --> 01:33:33.544]  We appreciate his time.
[01:33:33.544 --> 01:33:42.449]  Revolver.news is the website, folks, and it's truly one of the go-to websites if you want to stay informed on the information the mainstream media passes on.
[01:33:42.449 --> 01:33:47.853]  Darren, we had a subject of discussion we got a little bit off track on earlier, and I'd like you to just kind of re...
[01:33:49.454 --> 01:34:05.923]  Re-emphasize, everything from your investigation as far as FBI tampering with evidence from the edited footage of the pipe bomber and other such things, where is that issue at in this process to you?
[01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:18.009]  Well, where it's at is basically, you know, we did the editing piece with consultation with a number of kind of video forensics professionals.
[01:34:18.009 --> 01:34:34.395]  And the basic insight there was that the frame rate on the piece of footage that the FBI released of the pipe bomber at the pipe bomb site at the DNC was 1.2 frames per second, which is extremely slow.
[01:34:34.395 --> 01:34:36.836]  And it turns out on further research that
[01:34:37.436 --> 01:34:49.465]  The lowest commercially available surveillance standard is 8 frames per second, and even 8 is pretty rare.
[01:34:49.465 --> 01:34:57.351]  Like, even your average, like, gas station and McDonald's will typically have 10 to 15.
[01:34:57.351 --> 01:35:05.798]  And so I found it very bizarre that not only in it, first of all, like, the DNC has VIPs working there, VIPs coming and going,
[01:35:06.238 --> 01:35:11.581]  It's located in one of the most violent and dangerous cities in the country, namely Washington, DC.
[01:35:11.581 --> 01:35:21.947]  A break-in to the DNC was what precipitated one of the largest political scandals in American history, namely Watergate.
[01:35:21.947 --> 01:35:25.349]  So you think with all of those things and the budget they must have,
[01:35:26.195 --> 01:35:31.899]  They wouldn't be playing around with the lowest commercially available framerate.
[01:35:31.899 --> 01:35:39.224]  But it's actually worse than that, because the framerate they had was 1.2, where the lowest commercially available was 8.
[01:35:39.224 --> 01:35:44.648]  So, for them to have that, they didn't just, you know, buy the cheapest available.
[01:35:44.648 --> 01:35:55.035]  They had to go to find the one antique store that still carried, you know, a surveillance camera with that Jurassic-era... Yeah, I would wonder if you could even find it!
[01:35:55.895 --> 01:36:01.159]  I wonder if you sent out a crew, one of your crew members or riders, if they could even find one that does one frame per second.
[01:36:01.159 --> 01:36:02.140]  I bet they couldn't even find it.
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:03.241]  No, they can't.
[01:36:03.241 --> 01:36:05.723]  No, there is a, I mean, this is a whole industry.
[01:36:05.723 --> 01:36:08.325]  There's a security industry, a surveillance industry.
[01:36:08.325 --> 01:36:13.929]  They do tests and, you know, we looked at the recent sort of survey of
[01:36:14.909 --> 01:36:25.232]  Operational surveillance cameras and it found that 0% of operational surveillance cameras have between 0 and 5 frames per second.
[01:36:25.232 --> 01:36:25.612]  0%!
[01:36:25.612 --> 01:36:28.633]  So it's simply unheard of.
[01:36:28.633 --> 01:36:38.736]  There must be some additional explanation as to why the footage from the DNC has a frame rate that is so low that you never see it anywhere and that
[01:36:40.477 --> 01:36:46.039]  The cheapest available commercial cameras have far superior frame rates to that.
[01:36:46.039 --> 01:36:52.081]  And so it indicates that there was tampering involved and the tampering makes sense because again,
[01:36:52.864 --> 01:37:01.809]  When you cut the frame rate, it makes it a lot more difficult, in this case impossible, to see the perpetrator's face.
[01:37:01.809 --> 01:37:05.711]  So they, for whatever reason, didn't want us to see the perp's face.
[01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:12.135]  Cutting the frame rate makes it impossible to conduct an informal gait analysis.
[01:37:12.135 --> 01:37:13.656]  How does the suspect walk?
[01:37:13.656 --> 01:37:16.637]  You need a good frame rate in order to find that out.
[01:37:16.637 --> 01:37:20.980]  That's also curtailed with this tampering that
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:29.383]  You know, someone did, presumably the FBI or maybe some other point in the chain of custody, which is why we want the chain of custody.
[01:37:29.383 --> 01:37:43.449]  And thirdly, as I mentioned, cutting down the frame rate will make it more difficult to gauge just how actively and continuously the pipe bomber was texting with a third party while engaged in planting the pipe bomb.
[01:37:43.709 --> 01:37:53.879]  Which again, we don't even know if he planted it because the part of the footage that would have shown that was simply censored and that's an entirely different aspect from the frame rate issue.
[01:37:53.879 --> 01:37:54.040]  So...
[01:37:54.978 --> 01:38:05.847]  All of these reasons really point to a tremendous amount of suspicion toward the FBI and really, you know, if we're wrong about this, the issue can be settled easily.
[01:38:05.847 --> 01:38:13.334]  We just want the full chain of custody of that surveillance footage along with the raw and unedited footage.
[01:38:13.334 --> 01:38:14.755]  It's as simple as that.
[01:38:14.755 --> 01:38:17.637]  The issue can be settled as simply as that.
[01:38:17.637 --> 01:38:20.340]  We just want the chain of custody and the footage.
[01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:40.097]  Well, actually, the DNC has an answer for you as to why they have security cameras from the Stone Age, and they've just actually equipped a carrier pigeon with a message, and so the carrier pigeon will be delivering that to you in no time, I'm sure, with the Stone Age camera.
[01:38:40.097 --> 01:38:49.381]  I'm curious, because I actually just learned this recently, and as far as I can tell, this is new information, but I think it had been out there a while, but I'm not sure if I'd heard you talk about this yet.
[01:38:50.572 --> 01:38:56.015]  Did you hear that they, uh, they claim, I believe at the FBI, they claim that they detonated the pipe bomb.
[01:38:56.015 --> 01:38:56.615]  Did you see that?
[01:38:56.615 --> 01:39:00.157]  They claim they actually detonated it and blew it up?
[01:39:00.157 --> 01:39:04.340]  Yeah, there are conflicting reports about what exactly went on here.
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:13.885]  There's a, the full kind of forensics report pertaining to the pipe bomb is something that, um, parts of it were leaked to CBS.
[01:39:15.186 --> 01:39:18.949]  A long time ago, and beyond that, there's been no word.
[01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:33.259]  And so there were reports of some kind of detonation, but it's unclear whether that was actually detonating using the alleged live explosive material that they claim was there on the bomb.
[01:39:33.539 --> 01:39:33.960]  We're good to go.
[01:39:47.057 --> 01:40:06.153]  The full kind of the full forensics report that for whatever reason the government chose to leak portions to CBS and we haven't heard anything from it since but that's where we got a lot of our information including the report that there was live explosive material on it which if true
[01:40:06.893 --> 01:40:13.158]  Makes the official story even less believable because the Secret Service was conducting its sweep.
[01:40:13.158 --> 01:40:16.781]  Their dogs should have detected that immediately.
[01:40:16.781 --> 01:40:22.546]  There's nothing easier for Secret Service dogs to sit down next to live explosive, you know, powder.
[01:40:22.546 --> 01:40:25.588]  That's like the number one thing that they're trained to do.
[01:40:25.588 --> 01:40:32.534]  And so I guess the Secret Service dogs may have had COVID that day, and so their sense of smell was affected.
[01:40:32.534 --> 01:40:33.575]  But, um,
[01:40:34.475 --> 01:40:45.721]  I would love to get the full forensics report so we can better get to the bottom of all of the competing claims pertaining to the pipe bomb and its status when discovered.
[01:40:46.403 --> 01:41:10.712]  I mean, my reasoning would be, just because I know how they operate, my reasoning would be if they did, let's say, detonate it as its own explosive device, and they detonated it that way, then it obviously either had very little explosive impact, or none, or didn't detonate at all, which wouldn't work for the narrative, so maybe they did try that and it failed, and that's why they're not being clear about it, because, again,
[01:41:11.192 --> 01:41:12.052]  It just doesn't work.
[01:41:12.052 --> 01:41:14.313]  I mean, they'd want to build this up as bad as possible.
[01:41:14.313 --> 01:41:18.815]  If they detonated it and it turned out it was a massive bomb, then they'd want to use that for their narrative.
[01:41:18.815 --> 01:41:26.418]  And so the fact that they aren't tells me that, again, this is just more proof that they're lying about pretty much everything, sadly.
[01:41:26.418 --> 01:41:32.841]  And a lot of people have suffered because of the events of that day, and still to this moment, we don't get any answers that we can trust.
[01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:43.804]  Sadly, I think from our government, as far as what really happened that day and the investigation since, whether it's the geofencing, the pipe bomb, the security cameras, all of it, very sad.
[01:41:43.804 --> 01:41:54.287]  But hey, at least we're going to have high-definition footage of death warmed over Nancy Pelosi and all of her activities that day, Darren, so at least we have that as a consolation.
[01:41:55.828 --> 01:41:57.629]  Indeed, and really that's all we need.
[01:41:57.629 --> 01:42:03.073]  You know, you can't always get what you want, but you get what you need, so we can take solace in that.
[01:42:03.073 --> 01:42:09.857]  I mean, I love looking at beef jerky after it's been in the microwave for 30 minutes, and so that's going to be the HD footage of Nancy Pelosi.
[01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:12.759]  Amazing how she knew to have HD footage there that day.
[01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.340]  Darren Beattie, thank you so much.
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:16.902]  Revolver.News, folks, I'm telling you, it's a great go-to site.
[01:42:16.902 --> 01:42:21.645]  You want to find the news that the mainstream media doesn't want to touch, you're going to find it at Revolver.News.
[01:42:21.645 --> 01:42:22.866]  Dr. Darren Beattie, thank you so much.
[01:42:23.936 --> 01:42:24.336]  Thank you.
[01:42:24.336 --> 01:42:27.439]  All right, there he goes.
[01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:40.192]  Oh, man, I gotta tell you, folks, as somebody that's been at InfoWars here for, what is it, seven years or so, man, I mean, people like Dr. Darren Beatty are just a breath of fresh air.
[01:42:40.192 --> 01:42:44.917]  It's like a wind, a gust of wind in the sailboat.
[01:42:46.445 --> 01:42:52.908]  Thank God for great people like Darren Beattie and so many others that are trying to get the truth out there.
[01:42:52.908 --> 01:42:55.790]  Because that's what this country needs.
[01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:56.350]  Needs the truth.
[01:42:59.096 --> 01:43:06.081]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[01:43:06.081 --> 01:43:11.264]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:43:11.264 --> 01:43:18.329]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:43:18.329 --> 01:43:22.372]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[01:43:22.372 --> 01:43:26.535]  And you can do that now at Infowarestore.com.
[01:43:26.535 --> 01:43:28.136]  Help us clear out our stock
[01:43:28.476 --> 01:43:33.317]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and merry Christmas.
[01:43:58.368 --> 01:44:01.692]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[01:44:01.692 --> 01:44:04.515]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[01:44:04.515 --> 01:44:07.139]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[01:44:07.139 --> 01:44:08.540]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:12.465]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[01:44:12.465 --> 01:44:17.371]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:23.835]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[01:44:23.835 --> 01:44:32.561]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[01:44:32.561 --> 01:44:37.985]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[01:44:37.985 --> 01:44:43.569]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[01:44:43.809 --> 01:44:46.293]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[01:44:46.293 --> 01:44:48.956]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[01:44:48.956 --> 01:44:50.378]  So go check out the store.
[01:44:50.378 --> 01:44:51.660]  Go support their store.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:53.162]  Go support InfoWars.
[01:44:53.162 --> 01:44:54.524]  Leave a donation right now.
[01:44:54.524 --> 01:44:56.026]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[01:44:58.638 --> 01:45:10.409]  So when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it.
[01:45:10.409 --> 01:45:13.471]  So the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, and it was
[01:45:14.352 --> 01:45:14.733]  We're good.
[01:45:30.930 --> 01:45:36.936]  For the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back, and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[01:45:36.936 --> 01:45:39.318]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[01:45:39.318 --> 01:45:41.199]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[01:45:41.199 --> 01:45:43.442]  It'll literally, like, if you want to sleep, just take it.
[01:45:43.442 --> 01:45:44.182]  It's amazing.
[01:45:44.182 --> 01:45:44.703]  It works.
[01:45:44.703 --> 01:45:47.205]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[01:45:47.205 --> 01:45:53.451]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[01:45:53.451 --> 01:45:54.712]  Beautifully said, brother.
[01:45:54.712 --> 01:45:56.654]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[01:45:58.516 --> 01:46:19.151]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[01:46:19.651 --> 01:46:32.774]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[01:46:32.774 --> 01:46:41.616]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[01:46:41.616 --> 01:46:48.037]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[01:46:48.137 --> 01:46:49.558]  So, continue to do it.
[01:46:49.558 --> 01:46:51.759]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:51.759 --> 01:46:53.860]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:58.823]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive, because in the process, you're keeping American liberty alive.
[01:47:16.434 --> 01:47:19.095]  Alright, we're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.095 --> 01:47:20.156]  Owen Troyer filling in.
[01:47:20.156 --> 01:47:23.537]  Thanks for being with us today.
[01:47:23.537 --> 01:47:30.100]  Alex is hanging around, taking care of some business.
[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:34.362]  And folks, we need to take care of some business right now.
[01:47:34.362 --> 01:47:36.743]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:36.743 --> 01:47:37.564]  Have you heard of it?
[01:47:37.564 --> 01:47:41.426]  If not yet, do you have potatoes growing in your ears?
[01:47:41.426 --> 01:47:42.566]  What are you doing?
[01:47:42.566 --> 01:47:44.167]  Get over to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:45.447 --> 01:47:58.716]  Now look, the power of supplementation is truly one of the great health revolutions of the 21st century, and anybody who's studied it or anybody in the know is extremely into it.
[01:47:58.716 --> 01:48:05.901]  I mean, I'm no fan of Ray Kurzweil, but he talks about how he takes like 86 different supplemental pills a day.
[01:48:05.901 --> 01:48:10.544]  You know, Ray Kurzweil, a globalist, a transhumanist, but even he gets it.
[01:48:11.604 --> 01:48:20.576]  And so that's why we said, well let's just go out and find the highest quality supplements and then have the nexus point of the highest quality at the lowest price.
[01:48:20.576 --> 01:48:23.980]  And that's what we deliver at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:28.446]  Take vitamin D with calcium, the gummies, a perfect example.
[01:48:29.645 --> 01:48:36.210]  I suggest you have these out on the counter every morning for your kids before they go to school, especially right now in these winter months.
[01:48:36.210 --> 01:48:42.195]  I mean, folks, I'm telling you, here in Austin in the winter months, it's rare if we see the sun.
[01:48:42.195 --> 01:48:45.798]  We get to see the sun, we start getting on our knees and bowing.
[01:48:45.798 --> 01:48:47.179]  It's a miracle.
[01:48:47.879 --> 01:48:55.204]  And so, what do you do when you're not getting that vitamin D from the sun in the winter months, and then your immune system gets weakened?
[01:48:55.204 --> 01:48:58.385]  Well, if your answer is nothing, change that!
[01:48:58.385 --> 01:49:01.027]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com, get the vitamin D3 gummies.
[01:49:01.027 --> 01:49:05.190]  Great for adults, I'm just saying your kids will love them, and that way you'll know that you're...
[01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:10.976]  Children's immune system is boosted with the vitamin D, and they'll like the taste.
[01:49:10.976 --> 01:49:11.637]  They'll enjoy it.
[01:49:11.637 --> 01:49:12.477]  It's a gummy.
[01:49:12.477 --> 01:49:14.199]  So they'll be thinking, oh, it's like a gummy bear.
[01:49:14.199 --> 01:49:14.840]  It's like candy.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.861]  So it tastes good.
[01:49:15.861 --> 01:49:18.284]  And they get the vitamin D3.
[01:49:18.284 --> 01:49:22.669]  Just one of the great supplements at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:49:27.194 --> 01:49:36.741]  And they're realizing, hey, why should I be taking these big pharmaceutical pills that are so bad for me, so bad for my mind, so bad for my body?
[01:49:36.741 --> 01:49:47.528]  Why do I continue to take these things when I can get an all-natural nootropic like BrainForce Plus or BrainForce Ultra and support free speech by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com?

[01:50:08.369 --> 01:50:10.632]  I've got some other J6 stories on my desk.
[01:50:10.632 --> 01:50:12.635]  I'll just kind of breeze through these headlines quickly.
[01:50:15.995 --> 01:50:19.038]  Your stuff with Gateway Pundit has to stop.
[01:50:19.038 --> 01:50:19.679]  I kind of butchered that.
[01:50:19.679 --> 01:50:20.860]  Let me reset that.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:24.043]  Your stuff with Gateway Pundit has to stop.
[01:50:24.043 --> 01:50:28.307]  J6 political prisoner Ryan Samsel warned by authorities.
[01:50:28.307 --> 01:50:30.149]  FBI prison staff outraged.
[01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:35.934]  Gateway Pundit is telling the horrific stories of J6 prisoner abuse.
[01:50:35.934 --> 01:50:38.236]  Yeah, a lot is getting out.
[01:50:38.236 --> 01:50:39.558]  And I guess they don't like that.
[01:50:41.018 --> 01:50:48.600]  You should just release them, but they're political prisoners, so that's the situation there.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:54.381]  Retired Green Beret Jeremy Brown's attorney, FBI planted evidence in his trial.
[01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:56.921]  Oh, more of that narrative.
[01:50:56.921 --> 01:50:59.142]  Carrying over from the last segment.
[01:50:59.142 --> 01:51:00.082]  Call to action.
[01:51:00.082 --> 01:51:00.602]  D.C.
[01:51:00.602 --> 01:51:04.943]  Mayor Muriel Bowser refuses to allow J6 political prisoner visitation.
[01:51:06.118 --> 01:51:09.800]  Even computer visitation after nearly two years in D.C.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:10.280]  Gulag.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.502]  Folks, it's brutal for them.
[01:51:14.502 --> 01:51:24.308]  Political prisoners being held and tortured for the Democrat Party.
[01:51:24.308 --> 01:51:27.589]  Just breaks your heart.
[01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:29.930]  I hope this is the darkest day for America.
[01:51:29.930 --> 01:51:34.413]  I hope this is the darkest time in America, in our history.
[01:51:35.816 --> 01:51:38.077]  And there's no doubt that it is, in many ways.
[01:51:38.077 --> 01:51:41.758]  It's just a matter of how much worse does it have to get?
[01:51:41.758 --> 01:51:44.980]  How many political prisoners have to rot in jails?
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:51.903]  How much longer do we have to deal with this scourge, this cancer that is the Democrat Party?
[01:51:51.903 --> 01:52:01.327]  This scourge, this cancer that is left-wing ideology, which is really just authoritarianism and totalitarianism,
[01:52:02.409 --> 01:52:05.311]  Wearing the mask of communism or socialism.
[01:52:05.311 --> 01:52:06.132]  It's not.
[01:52:06.132 --> 01:52:08.653]  Socialism, communism, they're both the same.
[01:52:08.653 --> 01:52:16.759]  And socialism and communism, by nature, are authoritarian and totalitarian.
[01:52:16.759 --> 01:52:28.027]  And see, I get... I actually have people with kind of a communist mind or a socialist mind that reach out to me and they say, hey, I agree with most of your stuff, but why do you bash socialism so much?
[01:52:28.027 --> 01:52:29.548]  It doesn't have to be so bad.
[01:52:29.548 --> 01:52:29.668]  So,
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:33.862]  To me it's like this.
[01:52:33.862 --> 01:52:44.433]  We spent 21 trillion dollars for George Bush's wars in the Middle East that Barack Obama said he would end and then expanded.
[01:52:44.433 --> 01:52:47.836]  21 trillion dollars and then the disastrous pullout in Afghanistan.
[01:52:47.836 --> 01:52:49.798]  But let's just focus on this.
[01:52:49.798 --> 01:52:54.803]  21 trillion dollars on these wars didn't help us at all, did nothing for our country.
[01:52:54.803 --> 01:52:55.644]  Just millions dead.
[01:52:57.805 --> 01:52:58.665]  $21 trillion.
[01:52:58.665 --> 01:53:10.671]  So, I would understand the argument if I was going to say, hey, okay, socialism could work here.
[01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:16.934]  Yeah, $21 trillion spent on war, I would rather invest in our healthcare system.
[01:53:16.934 --> 01:53:19.395]  Absolutely.
[01:53:19.395 --> 01:53:20.795]  Absolutely.
[01:53:20.795 --> 01:53:21.576]  Now, I'd rather not
[01:53:22.577 --> 01:53:28.739]  Tax the American people to the price of $21 trillion to fund any of it.
[01:53:28.739 --> 01:53:30.299]  But yeah, no, I get the argument.
[01:53:30.299 --> 01:53:34.540]  I get the conclusion.
[01:53:34.540 --> 01:53:38.061]  If you're going to spend $21 trillion on war, why not spend it on education?
[01:53:38.061 --> 01:53:40.422]  Why not spend it on healthcare?
[01:53:40.422 --> 01:53:41.542]  Completely agree.
[01:53:41.542 --> 01:53:44.623]  I don't want to spend $21 trillion on war.
[01:53:44.623 --> 01:53:47.784]  But yeah, if you're going to spend $21 trillion, yeah, let's spend it on America.
[01:53:47.784 --> 01:53:50.505]  Let's help Americans.
[01:53:50.505 --> 01:53:51.005]  I get that.
[01:53:52.540 --> 01:53:53.620]  But none of it should be going on.
[01:53:53.620 --> 01:53:58.282]  But see, that's not even the point.
[01:53:58.282 --> 01:54:01.544]  It's that it always leads to what?
[01:54:01.544 --> 01:54:06.326]  Political prisoners and authoritarian and totalitarian.
[01:54:06.326 --> 01:54:08.486]  Because how do you get everybody to do the same thing?
[01:54:08.486 --> 01:54:10.427]  You can't.
[01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:12.528]  You shouldn't want to.
[01:54:12.528 --> 01:54:19.691]  But that's ultimately the bottom of the barrel of communism and socialism.
[01:54:20.953 --> 01:54:24.359]  Which this current administration is, and that's why they lie to you all the time.
[01:54:24.359 --> 01:54:26.343]  And they've got all kinds of shortages.
[01:54:26.343 --> 01:54:27.766]  The economy is, uh...
[01:54:28.925 --> 01:54:36.230]  I think after Christmas, folks, I think once we get into next year, you're really going to start seeing how bad it is.
[01:54:36.230 --> 01:54:51.640]  And I'm guessing that Austin is not alone in that they're debating what they're going to do locally with the electricity prices because they're running at a deficit of like $20, $30 million with the deals they cut with the power companies here to switch to green energy.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.501]  And it just didn't work.
[01:54:52.501 --> 01:54:54.022]  I mean, it's just not there.
[01:54:54.022 --> 01:54:55.143]  How am I going to get solar energy?
[01:54:55.143 --> 01:54:56.103]  There's no sun today.
[01:54:56.103 --> 01:54:57.724]  How am I going to get wind energy?
[01:54:57.724 --> 01:54:58.405]  There's no wind today.
[01:54:59.265 --> 01:54:59.966]  No, we need coal.
[01:54:59.966 --> 01:55:02.307]  We need gas.
[01:55:02.307 --> 01:55:06.570]  And so the switch didn't work, and they can't keep the prices down.
[01:55:06.570 --> 01:55:08.931]  And so they're literally, I mean, they're talking about it here.
[01:55:08.931 --> 01:55:11.773]  They're saying we might just have to double electricity prices.
[01:55:11.773 --> 01:55:12.834]  And that's just their only option.
[01:55:12.834 --> 01:55:14.195]  They don't know what else to do.
[01:55:14.195 --> 01:55:15.816]  So my guess is that's not isolated here.
[01:55:15.816 --> 01:55:17.137]  But here's Karine Jean-Pierre.
[01:55:18.615 --> 01:55:20.698]  Discussing the medicine shortages.
[01:55:20.698 --> 01:55:22.461]  So this is a new one.
[01:55:22.461 --> 01:55:25.606]  The medical shortages, thanks to the Biden administration.
[01:55:25.606 --> 01:55:28.610]  This is right after she told you how great everything was going.
[01:55:28.610 --> 01:55:31.154]  And then she tells you about medical shortages.
[01:55:31.154 --> 01:55:32.756]  But it's not a big deal, she says in clip four.
[01:55:34.432 --> 01:55:36.913]  Is there something that the President has been engaged in?
[01:55:36.913 --> 01:55:39.713]  Has he been briefed on medicine shortages?
[01:55:39.713 --> 01:55:44.535]  So let me just say this and share where we are.
[01:55:44.535 --> 01:55:54.517]  So, as I've said, as you mentioned, on Monday I was asked by your colleague, I believe Ben, the administration is closely monitoring for the possibility of any national shortages.
[01:55:54.517 --> 01:55:57.538]  Medicine shortages are not uncommon.
[01:55:57.538 --> 01:55:58.258]  Oh, it's not uncommon.
[01:55:58.258 --> 01:56:00.559]  It's closely monitored and led by the FDA.
[01:56:00.939 --> 01:56:07.724]  So remember, we had the baby formula shortage, you had food shortages, you have a diesel shortage.
[01:56:07.724 --> 01:56:08.705]  Right.
[01:56:08.705 --> 01:56:10.546]  Oh, it's just, that's just common.
[01:56:10.546 --> 01:56:13.088]  Yeah, you're right, it is common in a communist country.
[01:56:13.088 --> 01:56:15.209]  You're right, it is common in a socialist country.
[01:56:15.209 --> 01:56:17.331]  You're right, it is common in a third world country.
[01:56:17.331 --> 01:56:18.511]  I guess she's being honest now.
[01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.993]  I guess this is Jean-Pierre being honest now.
[01:56:21.993 --> 01:56:22.853]  You're right.
[01:56:22.853 --> 01:56:28.494]  Medical shortages, power shortages, this is all normal in a socialist third-world country.
[01:56:28.494 --> 01:56:30.275]  Thank you, Karine Jean-Pierre, for telling us.
[01:56:30.275 --> 01:56:32.595]  Because she just said, I just want to address the state of things.
[01:56:32.595 --> 01:56:34.296]  So she's addressing the state of things.
[01:56:34.296 --> 01:56:37.557]  You're in a third-world socialist country under Biden-Harris.
[01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:39.617]  And so she's just saying, this is normal.
[01:56:39.617 --> 01:56:40.397]  This is common.
[01:56:40.397 --> 01:56:41.498]  Don't you know?
[01:56:41.498 --> 01:56:41.998]  Finish the clip.
[01:56:42.619 --> 01:56:45.983]  Let me explain to you what has just happened in this video.
[01:57:01.906 --> 01:57:08.651]  The Biden administration, the Democrat Party has operatives in the press pool, in the White House press room.
[01:57:08.651 --> 01:57:10.772]  And they stage questions.
[01:57:10.772 --> 01:57:18.618]  So when they see that there's an issue about to arise, or they see that there's an anti-Biden narrative about to form, they try to get ahead of it.
[01:57:18.618 --> 01:57:22.881]  So the issue of medical shortages hasn't really been a big issue yet.
[01:57:22.881 --> 01:57:28.445]  So this is them planting a question in the press pool to get out ahead of it.
[01:57:28.445 --> 01:57:29.345]  And you can see it.
[01:57:29.345 --> 01:57:31.367]  So they plant the question, she calls on the planted.
[01:57:32.236 --> 01:57:37.659]  ...journalist, and then she just reads, put her on the screen as we go to break, she just reads off a script.
[01:57:37.659 --> 01:57:38.800]  That's all planted, folks.
[01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:39.460]  That's all fake.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:40.801]  Again, this is what communists do.
[01:57:40.801 --> 01:57:43.062]  This is called propaganda.
[01:57:43.062 --> 01:57:46.324]  They plant a journalist to ask a question and then she reads off a script.
[01:57:48.865 --> 01:57:58.415]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.

[01:58:11.129 --> 01:58:11.489]  Thank you.
[01:58:30.263 --> 01:58:30.644]  Thank you.
[01:58:49.289 --> 01:58:56.274]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[01:58:56.274 --> 01:59:01.478]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[01:59:01.478 --> 01:59:08.523]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[01:59:08.523 --> 01:59:11.685]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[01:59:12.545 --> 01:59:16.707]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:59:16.707 --> 01:59:23.169]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[01:59:23.169 --> 01:59:30.592]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[01:59:30.592 --> 01:59:33.833]  Now, with free shipping.
[01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.113]  We thank you for your support.
[01:59:36.113 --> 01:59:40.075]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[01:59:50.686 --> 01:59:55.308]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:55.308 --> 02:00:05.552]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.552 --> 02:00:15.437]  We got one more from Jean-Pierre and then a doozy from Biden's economic advisor, Brian Deese.
[02:00:15.437 --> 02:00:16.057]  But remember,
[02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:26.543]  And Trump has said this, that we need to repeal the vaccine mandate for the military and do back pay for all of those who were terminated for refusing to get it.
[02:00:26.543 --> 02:00:35.929]  And then the Republicans in Congress said... I don't remember what their threat was, but they basically said, if you don't... Oh, it was to cut funding.
[02:00:35.929 --> 02:00:36.830]  They said, if you don't...
[02:00:38.038 --> 02:00:43.062]  Relieve the military of the vaccine mandate and now they want the mask mandate returned at bases too.
[02:00:43.062 --> 02:00:49.287]  So they said if you don't relieve the military of the mask mandates and the vaccine mandates, we're going to cut funding to the military.
[02:00:49.287 --> 02:00:57.653]  I guess the Democrats didn't blink at that because here's Jean Pierre today saying that mandate is not going anywhere.
[02:00:57.653 --> 02:01:05.359]  And we believe that it is a mistake what we saw, what we saw happen on the NDAA as it relates to the vaccine mandate.
[02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:07.560]  Again, reading off a script.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:17.423]  I mean, you just... This is like, we might as well have Kim Jong Un as president with his sister running the propaganda administration.
[02:01:17.423 --> 02:01:20.424]  I mean, this is just absurd.
[02:01:20.424 --> 02:01:21.424]  It's just absurd.
[02:01:21.424 --> 02:01:31.307]  So, okay, no vaccine mandate relinquished from the military, and they're going to put that mask back on your face, too, because they love you so much.
[02:01:31.307 --> 02:01:32.447]  Now, this is...
[02:01:34.113 --> 02:01:39.520]  Honestly, like, this is to the point where it's just like, I should just quit.
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:42.303]  Like, we should all just quit.
[02:01:42.303 --> 02:01:50.573]  And I don't want to be redundant from something I covered yesterday on The War Room, but it's so key to understanding everything.
[02:01:51.795 --> 02:01:57.101]  As a follow-up to what top Biden economic advisor Brian Deese is about to say.
[02:01:57.101 --> 02:02:00.365]  So listen, of course we know about their climate change agenda.
[02:02:00.365 --> 02:02:04.310]  We know about the net neutral, carbon neutral, and man-made climate change.
[02:02:04.310 --> 02:02:04.690]  Okay, right.
[02:02:04.690 --> 02:02:07.534]  We know about the Green New Deal, all this bullcrap.
[02:02:07.534 --> 02:02:10.537]  So, but let's really bring it home.
[02:02:11.877 --> 02:02:16.384]  And tell you what it means, not by our admission, but by a Democrat's admission.
[02:02:16.384 --> 02:02:19.889]  That's what's so incredible about this, is now the Democrats are telling you what it really means.
[02:02:19.889 --> 02:02:21.472]  But first, let's set it up.
[02:02:21.472 --> 02:02:25.097]  Here's Biden's economic advisor, Brian Deese, on the climate change issue.
[02:02:25.982 --> 02:02:34.993]  One of the things Larry did say last week at the Doable Conference was that he said he expects fossil fuels to be part of our life for at least the next 70 years.
[02:02:34.993 --> 02:02:36.575]  Do you agree with that?
[02:02:36.575 --> 02:02:42.803]  And do you believe that that's a consistent message from him, given that you've spent a long time with him over the years?
[02:02:44.028 --> 02:02:52.673]  Look, I'll tell you what our view is, which is we need to rapidly hit our climate goals, including a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030.
[02:02:52.673 --> 02:02:59.757]  As you do that, you still see a reliance and you still see a maintenance, for example, of oil in the energy mix.
[02:02:59.757 --> 02:03:02.639]  That's something that will be true for the next several years.
[02:03:02.639 --> 02:03:04.560]  But the real opportunity here, and
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:06.441]  And I hear this from companies across the board.
[02:03:06.441 --> 02:03:15.709]  The real opportunity here is to now move as quickly as possible to develop and to expand and to scale these new zero-carbon technologies.
[02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:23.876]  So, here's what I'm going to have to do, I think, is I'm going to have to pull this clip from yesterday of Frank Figluzzi on MSNBC.
[02:03:23.876 --> 02:03:26.478]  Now, actually, according to Democrats, we're all already dead.
[02:03:27.738 --> 02:03:31.381]  Uh, because we didn't do enough about climate change 20 years ago, we're all already dead.
[02:03:31.381 --> 02:03:35.544]  According to Al Gore's documentary, we're all drowning in the sea levels rising.
[02:03:35.544 --> 02:03:37.085]  It's all BS, folks.
[02:03:37.085 --> 02:03:40.947]  Look, most of the knowledge is esoteric, but there's enough information.
[02:03:40.947 --> 02:03:43.509]  We know the ice ages come in cycles.
[02:03:43.509 --> 02:03:47.572]  It's all about the rotation of the sun around the... so it's just...
[02:03:49.161 --> 02:03:50.082]  I'm not even going to get into that.
[02:03:50.082 --> 02:03:59.967]  The point is, it's all BS, they know it's all BS, and now it's all been proven BS, because everything they've been saying for decades has not a single one of it come true.
[02:03:59.967 --> 02:04:02.769]  So they're still lying to you about this.
[02:04:02.769 --> 02:04:06.891]  But okay, what's the solution, they say?
[02:04:06.891 --> 02:04:09.833]  Well, what is the solution is, you have to cut energy.
[02:04:11.067 --> 02:04:12.488]  You have to stop man activities.
[02:04:12.488 --> 02:04:14.128]  You have to stop men.
[02:04:14.128 --> 02:04:17.490]  You want to stop man-made climate change, you're going to have to stop man.
[02:04:17.490 --> 02:04:30.396]  So, okay, you don't fly on an airplane, you don't drive a vehicle, you don't get to go out on a boat ride, you don't get to travel, you don't get to eat steak or meat or anything like that.
[02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:31.397]  And so that's what it is.
[02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:35.179]  And they say, we're shutting down fossil fuels, we're shutting down oil, we're shutting down coal.
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:39.443]  Now it's obvious what that would do to civilization.
[02:04:39.443 --> 02:04:40.504]  They don't tell you that.
[02:04:40.504 --> 02:04:43.206]  Except they do tell you that.
[02:04:43.206 --> 02:04:49.911]  And Frank Figluzzi, a Democrat FBI agent, told you what's going to happen on MSNBC.
[02:04:49.911 --> 02:04:53.594]  But see, he accidentally admitted their big plan without telling you.
[02:04:53.594 --> 02:04:55.496]  I'm going to show you on the other side of this break.
[02:04:59.687 --> 02:05:08.533]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:05:08.533 --> 02:05:12.356]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.
[02:05:12.356 --> 02:05:21.442]  But we've signed a new deal with a big national shipping company and they're able to cut our regular shipping costs by up to 50%.
[02:05:21.442 --> 02:05:23.463]  So that means even on orders that are below $50,
[02:05:24.244 --> 02:05:27.686]  You're going to be paying way lower than you were previously.
[02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:29.127]  This is a game changer.
[02:05:29.127 --> 02:05:30.668]  We're so excited about it.
[02:05:30.668 --> 02:05:32.929]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[02:05:32.929 --> 02:05:37.352]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[02:05:37.352 --> 02:05:40.474]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[02:05:40.474 --> 02:05:42.915]  The same great customer service and more.
[02:05:42.915 --> 02:05:49.259]  So, get huge discounts and free shipping on so many great items at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:05:49.599 --> 02:05:56.321]  I want to thank you all for your support, but now there's no excuse to boost your immune system, lead a healthier life, and keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:05:56.321 --> 02:06:04.283]  InfoWarsTroyer.com.
[02:06:04.283 --> 02:06:08.605]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:08.605 --> 02:06:13.326]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:13.326 --> 02:06:16.247]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:23.052 --> 02:06:25.114]  So I played this clip yesterday.
[02:06:25.114 --> 02:06:33.162]  Now again, the Democrats have been telling you for decades that man's activities on this planet are going to kill the planet.
[02:06:33.162 --> 02:06:34.484]  They've been lying about that.
[02:06:34.484 --> 02:06:35.165]  They know it.
[02:06:35.165 --> 02:06:40.530]  And now it's just been proven with documentaries like Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth.
[02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:42.152]  Not a single thing he predicted in that 2002...
[02:06:43.553 --> 02:06:46.355]  Documentary has come true.
[02:06:46.355 --> 02:06:53.521]  They put signs at the National Glacier Park that says all these glaciers will be melted by 2020.
[02:06:53.521 --> 02:06:54.642]  2020 has come and went.
[02:06:54.642 --> 02:06:55.843]  They had to remove the sign.
[02:06:55.843 --> 02:06:57.164]  The glaciers are bigger than ever.
[02:06:57.164 --> 02:06:58.085]  So I'm not going to sit here.
[02:06:58.085 --> 02:07:09.094]  The Vostok ice core samples, the expansion of the South Pole ice caps, I'm not going to sit here and just go over all the evidence that everything they tell you about man-made climate change is a lie.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:11.141]  It's all a lie.
[02:07:11.141 --> 02:07:14.844]  Whether they actually believe it or they just want to use the lie to control you is irrelevant.
[02:07:14.844 --> 02:07:16.306]  It's all a lie.
[02:07:16.306 --> 02:07:17.407]  Well, I shouldn't say it's irrelevant.
[02:07:17.407 --> 02:07:17.967]  It is relevant.
[02:07:17.967 --> 02:07:20.309]  But for this discussion, it doesn't matter.
[02:07:20.309 --> 02:07:21.170]  Point is, it's a lie.
[02:07:21.170 --> 02:07:25.574]  So, what would this actually look like, though?
[02:07:25.574 --> 02:07:26.375]  They don't tell you that.
[02:07:26.375 --> 02:07:33.882]  They just sit there and virtue signal as the good guys, saying, we're going to stop man-made climate change, we're going to save the Earth, we're saving you, we're the good guys.
[02:07:33.882 --> 02:07:35.943]  Well, they're actually the bad guys that want to control you.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:45.828]  But what would it look like if you shut down human activity, if you shut down energy, like they're doing, it's the end of civilization as you know it.
[02:07:45.828 --> 02:07:57.879]  And if you don't realize how the final conclusion to this agenda is you dying, just you dying, forget about you living in the pod, not owning anything, eating bugs.
[02:07:57.879 --> 02:08:01.323]  That's the final stage before you get murdered.
[02:08:02.578 --> 02:08:09.900]  Oh, come get your new COVID, like, come get your new COVID vaccine, and then that's the one that... Done.
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:12.801]  And we have now successfully ended man.
[02:08:12.801 --> 02:08:13.822]  Made climate change.
[02:08:13.822 --> 02:08:15.982]  But okay.
[02:08:15.982 --> 02:08:18.863]  We all know that's what would happen if they shut the energy off.
[02:08:18.863 --> 02:08:23.165]  But they don't tell you that until they do.
[02:08:23.165 --> 02:08:24.165]  Frank Figluzzi
[02:08:26.164 --> 02:08:36.212]  Democrat FBI agent who goes on MSNBC as a guest, one of the most whacked-out psychotics that's ever been on TV, and worked in the federal government.
[02:08:36.212 --> 02:08:39.954]  And he accidentally tells you the big plan.
[02:08:39.954 --> 02:08:44.218]  And so, let me give you the context, and it ties into some other news today that I'll get to.
[02:08:45.763 --> 02:08:49.906]  A power plant in North Carolina got sabotaged.
[02:08:49.906 --> 02:08:52.228]  Somebody went there or multiple people went there.
[02:08:52.228 --> 02:08:53.629]  They don't have any suspects.
[02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:54.590]  They don't know anything right now.
[02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:56.031]  They're still investigating it.
[02:08:56.031 --> 02:08:59.934]  And they shot into a power plant.
[02:08:59.934 --> 02:09:10.382]  And apparently they must have had some knowledge because the law enforcement says the place that they shot in their investigation, they found out that this person had to know to shoot right there to sabotage the whole thing.
[02:09:10.382 --> 02:09:11.523]  It couldn't have been a lucky guess.
[02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:25.674]  So Frank Figluzzi covering this blames it on Trump supporters and says that it was Trump supporters trying to sabotage a drag queen sexy time for kids event.
[02:09:25.674 --> 02:09:35.357]  And so he says Trump supporters sabotaged this power plant as part of their anti-LGBTQ activism with no evidence, he says that.
[02:09:35.357 --> 02:09:36.437]  But here's the beauty of it.
[02:09:37.489 --> 02:10:05.804]  When Frank Figluzzi believes, Democrat FBI agent who goes on MSNBC, when Frank Figluzzi believes that it's Trump supporters that sabotaged the power grid, listen to the conclusions that he reaches on live television, unwittingly showing you the entire globalist corporate government stop man-made climate change plan, accidentally, because he thinks in this moment he can blame it on Trump supporters,
[02:10:06.044 --> 02:10:09.925]  Listen to this all-time classic.
[02:10:09.925 --> 02:10:20.126]  Well, we all want to know who and why, and that's where the FBI comes in, not only generally when they respond to crimes and support... Pause it right there, because he lies right out of the gates.
[02:10:20.126 --> 02:10:21.407]  He doesn't want to know who or why.
[02:10:21.407 --> 02:10:23.667]  He's already decided who and why.
[02:10:23.667 --> 02:10:28.688]  He's already decided it's Trump supporters that wanted to sabotage a drag queen sexy time event for kids.
[02:10:28.688 --> 02:10:29.868]  He doesn't want to know who or why.
[02:10:29.868 --> 02:10:31.808]  He's already determined that.
[02:10:31.808 --> 02:10:34.929]  There's an investigation ongoing, and he's already reached his conclusion.
[02:10:34.929 --> 02:10:35.249]  Go on.
[02:10:37.577 --> 02:10:41.478]  ...develop a profile, they're gonna help with forensic, physical evidence, all of that, yes.
[02:10:41.478 --> 02:10:46.139]  But we know the FBI, of course, is the lead agency for an act of domestic terrorism.
[02:10:46.139 --> 02:10:48.360]  And they're gonna be pursuing motive here.
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.542]  And yes, it's quick and convenient to say, look, we know about this planned drag show in town.
[02:10:53.542 --> 02:10:54.842]  It happens, I think, every year.
[02:10:55.322 --> 02:11:03.366]  And yes, the coordinators of that show said they have been receiving unprecedented levels of threats or disagreement over this.
[02:11:03.366 --> 02:11:06.887]  So they'll be exploring all of that, the communications around that event.
[02:11:06.887 --> 02:11:13.210]  But let's not necessarily do the quick and convenient thing, because there's something much larger going on here, Nicole.
[02:11:13.210 --> 02:11:16.271]  We saw something similar to this out in California in 2013.
[02:11:16.271 --> 02:11:17.412]  It's never been solved.
[02:11:17.412 --> 02:11:24.555]  It was at a Pacific Gas and Electric facility where sniper fire was used to take out Transformers at a substation.
[02:11:25.095 --> 02:11:33.142]  And it woke everybody up in law enforcement to how vulnerable the threat was to our infrastructure, our power grid, and lots of security took place after that.
[02:11:33.142 --> 02:11:40.649]  Cameras and patrols and all kinds of things that are in place now, particularly at a big player like Duke Energy in North Carolina, where this happened.
[02:11:40.649 --> 02:11:44.772]  So this requires a very sophisticated... Now this is where it gets amazing, folks.
[02:11:44.772 --> 02:11:48.676]  Okay, so you've seen the build-up, you've seen the narrative.
[02:11:48.676 --> 02:11:51.218]  Now I want you to think about the framing I've given you.
[02:11:52.554 --> 02:12:00.804]  With the entire Stop Man-Made Climate Change Agenda, Green Agenda, Carbon Neutral Agenda, Get Carbon Emissions Down to Zero Agenda.
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:03.321]  What are they doing?
[02:12:03.321 --> 02:12:08.626]  They're shutting off the power, shutting down coal, shutting down gas, shutting off the energy, right?
[02:12:08.626 --> 02:12:11.709]  That's what they're doing to stop man-made climate change, and that's a good thing.
[02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:15.512]  So their agenda is to shut off the energy to stop man-made climate change.
[02:12:15.512 --> 02:12:16.633]  That's a good thing.
[02:12:16.633 --> 02:12:21.978]  But listen to the conclusion that Fig Lucey reaches when he thinks that that's what Trump supporters are doing.
[02:12:21.978 --> 02:12:22.639]  It's incredible.
[02:12:22.639 --> 02:12:23.059]  Watch this.
[02:12:24.090 --> 02:12:49.440]  thing going on here is the knowledge it takes to know what you're shooting at, what equipment, the relay system, the backup that's going to happen to the next substation when the first one you shoot at goes down, and then we know in law enforcement that there's increased chatter and even specific instructions as recently as last year in something called the Accelerationist Handbook that shows you how to do this.
[02:12:49.440 --> 02:12:50.721]  The theory behind this
[02:12:51.021 --> 02:13:00.248]  The idea, the bigger idea here, is that you can quickly destabilize society and get to chaos if you pull the plug, literally.
[02:13:00.248 --> 02:13:05.733]  They see electricity, Nicole, as the great equalizer in society that makes everybody kind of equal.
[02:13:05.733 --> 02:13:06.894]  They don't like that.
[02:13:06.894 --> 02:13:18.603]  So they want survivalists and white nationalists, this is the far right side of accelerationist theory, because there's a far left side too, but the far right side, which has been chatting about this ad nauseam for the past couple
[02:13:18.643 --> 02:13:18.743]  Okay.
[02:13:18.743 --> 02:13:22.685]  Now, I would like to just cut out that last part where he says, pull the plug to destabilize.
[02:13:22.685 --> 02:13:23.205]  So, okay.
[02:13:23.205 --> 02:13:25.666]  So, this is Frank Figluzzi's Democrat FBI agent's logic on MSNBC.
[02:13:48.641 --> 02:13:59.728]  Is that when you shut off the energy, or as his words, pull the plug, you destabilize and cause chaos in a scenario to empower yourself.
[02:13:59.728 --> 02:14:03.271]  He says that energy is the great equalizer.
[02:14:03.271 --> 02:14:05.932]  And that they don't like this.
[02:14:05.932 --> 02:14:10.635]  So again, let's just look at this here from Frank Figluzzi's logic.
[02:14:10.635 --> 02:14:12.777]  Democrat, FBI agent on MSNBC.
[02:14:14.929 --> 02:14:19.994]  People that want to shut off your energy want to destabilize civilization.
[02:14:19.994 --> 02:14:30.303]  They want to cause chaos and they want to pull the plug because energy is the great equalizer and they want to dominate and conquer you and take control.
[02:14:30.303 --> 02:14:34.767]  Does that sound familiar to anybody?
[02:14:34.767 --> 02:14:41.573]  You do realize that that is exactly what the Democrat Party agenda and policy is.
[02:14:42.898 --> 02:14:48.179]  To pull the plug and to shut off energy.
[02:14:48.179 --> 02:14:51.620]  Oh, but I guess when they do it, it's not to destabilize.
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:54.681]  I guess when they do it, it's not going to cause chaos.
[02:14:54.681 --> 02:15:00.502]  I guess when they're the ones deciding who gets energy and who doesn't, it's not the great equalizer.
[02:15:00.502 --> 02:15:10.305]  But when Frank Figluzzi makes up a fantastical tale in his own mind about something that happened in North Carolina with no evidence,
[02:15:11.749 --> 02:15:26.634]  And he reaches the conclusion that people that want to destabilize civilization and take away the great equalizer of cheap and easily accessible energy, that they're terrorists and that's a bad thing.
[02:15:26.634 --> 02:15:31.015]  When he thinks it's Trump supporters doing it, something he made up in his own mind.
[02:15:31.015 --> 02:15:32.816]  But ladies and gentlemen, as you know,
[02:15:33.939 --> 02:15:44.023]  That is the exact agenda of carbon neutrality, net zero carbon emissions, and the Green New Policies.
[02:15:44.023 --> 02:15:55.467]  So to Frank Figluzzi, he just admitted the entire Green New Carbon Neutral Policy is to destabilize, cause chaos, and take away the Great Equalizer to conquer you.
[02:15:58.539 --> 02:16:10.025]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:16:10.025 --> 02:16:14.488]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:16:14.488 --> 02:16:18.450]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:21.791]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:16:21.791 --> 02:16:23.132]  You see, the sun
[02:16:24.693 --> 02:16:24.993]  We're good to
[02:16:48.593 --> 02:16:52.356]  At InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.
[02:16:52.356 --> 02:16:53.056]  Don't wait!
[02:16:53.056 --> 02:16:57.359]  Support the InfoWar and your immune system with vitamin D3 gummies at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:16:58.629 --> 02:17:08.772]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:17:08.772 --> 02:17:16.815]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:17:16.815 --> 02:17:23.057]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[02:17:23.957 --> 02:17:29.822]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:17:29.822 --> 02:17:48.097]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Makaru from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[02:17:51.338 --> 02:18:00.742]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[02:18:00.742 --> 02:18:04.764]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[02:18:04.764 --> 02:18:06.085]  There's a solution.
[02:18:06.085 --> 02:18:07.085]  The Wellness Company.
[02:18:07.085 --> 02:18:10.387]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[02:18:10.387 --> 02:18:17.590]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:43.909]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[02:18:44.984 --> 02:18:45.484]  I think so.
[02:19:05.345 --> 02:19:15.735]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:19:15.735 --> 02:19:28.486]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:19:29.147 --> 02:19:29.747]  We're good to go!
[02:19:59.167 --> 02:20:03.789]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.789 --> 02:20:10.211]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:10.211 --> 02:20:13.713]  So you see, it's... It's the stuff...
[02:20:23.430 --> 02:20:34.973]  Like what we just played in the last segment, where I'm just like, if people can't see this, why, you're just, there's no, it's done, we're done, it's over, it's futile.
[02:20:34.973 --> 02:20:51.218]  Frank Figluzzi says, sabotaging energy, turning off energy, the great equalizer, will cause destabilization, chaos, and that's a bad thing, except when liberals and democrats do it, it's a good policy.
[02:20:52.824 --> 02:21:04.788]  I mean, it's just, like right then and there, I should not hear a damn word further from a leftist liberal Democrat about your new energy, your green energy agenda.
[02:21:04.788 --> 02:21:09.329]  Frank Figluzzi, your own guy, just explained what it's really about.
[02:21:09.329 --> 02:21:14.731]  But see, he thought he could blame that on Trump supporters, so in that instance, it's a good thing.
[02:21:16.209 --> 02:21:21.070]  To say, hey, when you turn off the power grid, you're going to destabilize, and that's a bad thing.
[02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:23.451]  But when they do it, it's good policy.
[02:21:23.451 --> 02:21:24.131]  Don't believe me?
[02:21:24.131 --> 02:21:26.451]  Here, how about some further proof here.
[02:21:26.451 --> 02:21:34.453]  Here's John Kerry, who flies around the planet, and then when he gets asked about his carbon footprint, he says, well, I get to fly around the planet, just not you.
[02:21:34.453 --> 02:21:36.254]  Oh, thank you, John.
[02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:42.535]  Here he is talking about how they have to accelerate their green new energy agenda in clip one.
[02:21:44.117 --> 02:21:49.823]  And so, everything has to accelerate, and by, you know, vast amounts.
[02:21:49.823 --> 02:21:53.386]  We have to be deploying renewables six times faster than we are today.
[02:21:53.386 --> 02:21:57.450]  We have to be deploying electric vehicles about twenty times faster than we are today.
[02:21:57.450 --> 02:22:00.512]  If you're going to keep the Earth's temperature at 1.5 degrees of increase.
[02:22:00.512 --> 02:22:02.174]  Right.
[02:22:02.174 --> 02:22:08.059]  I just, it's just, it's unreal the amount of lies.
[02:22:08.059 --> 02:22:08.360]  I just...
[02:22:09.918 --> 02:22:17.963]  Oh yeah, because mining for lithium and cobalt and everything else it takes to make the electric car battery is so much better.
[02:22:17.963 --> 02:22:22.766]  You've just completely destroyed the rainforest in the Philippines mining for lithium, but forget that.
[02:22:22.766 --> 02:22:25.528]  The child slaves over there doing that.
[02:22:25.528 --> 02:22:26.329]  What about the cobalt?
[02:22:26.329 --> 02:22:27.129]  What about everything else?
[02:22:27.129 --> 02:22:29.511]  Oh, that doesn't matter.
[02:22:29.511 --> 02:22:34.174]  And John Kerry flies around the world on private jets telling you that you can't fly around the world on private jets.
[02:22:35.558 --> 02:22:43.961]  But again, this is, I mean, it's so elementary here, I don't even, how many different ways do I tell you 1 plus 1 equals 2?
[02:22:43.961 --> 02:22:51.703]  How many different examples, how many different methods can I show you that 1 plus 1 equals 2?
[02:22:51.703 --> 02:22:52.723]  Because that's what this is.
[02:22:52.723 --> 02:22:54.184]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:22:54.184 --> 02:22:56.004]  I'm just trying to figure out how to explain it.
[02:22:56.004 --> 02:23:02.226]  So, again, it's official, Democrat, corporate world government, world economic forum policy,
[02:23:03.766 --> 02:23:11.368]  To end carbon emissions, get to carbon emission zero, and have all this green new energy stuff, and so what does that look like?
[02:23:11.368 --> 02:23:15.408]  They're shutting off coal, they're shutting off gas, and what does that look like?
[02:23:15.408 --> 02:23:21.250]  Your electricity bill is going up, now you can't even afford it, look at what's going on in Europe right now.
[02:23:21.250 --> 02:23:27.831]  Where they're telling people, you can't charge your electric car, we don't have the energy, you can't play video games online, we don't have the energy.
[02:23:29.464 --> 02:23:41.207]  So their official agenda, the official Democrat, liberal world order agenda, is to shut off your energy, and in that case they say it's to save the planet.
[02:23:41.207 --> 02:23:54.631]  But when Frank Figluzzi makes up a fantastical tale of what he believes are a group of Trump supporters shutting down a power plant in North Carolina to destabilize and cause chaos, that's terrorism.
[02:23:56.403 --> 02:23:59.084]  Even though that's exactly what their official policy is.
[02:23:59.084 --> 02:24:13.347]  So even though it didn't happen, yes, if somebody goes to blow up a power plant to shut down the power grid for an ulterior motive that's political in nature, that is terrorism.
[02:24:13.347 --> 02:24:18.809]  Absolutely 100% Frank Figluzzi would be right, except that he made the story up.
[02:24:18.809 --> 02:24:21.950]  But no, Frank Figluzzi is right.
[02:24:21.950 --> 02:24:22.930]  If you sabotage
[02:24:24.028 --> 02:24:28.730]  A power plant, for an ulterior political motive, you're a terrorist.
[02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:37.133]  Except when the Democrats do it, when the World Economic Forum does it, and when liberals promote it, they're saving the planet.
[02:24:37.133 --> 02:24:39.054]  But see, Frank Figluzzi was just being honest.
[02:24:40.182 --> 02:24:45.546]  When he was thinking he was going to be able to blame this on conservatives and right-wingers and Trump supporters, he was being honest.
[02:24:45.546 --> 02:24:49.548]  He was saying, yeah, when you sabotage the power grid, you destroy civilization.
[02:24:49.548 --> 02:24:50.389]  You cause chaos.
[02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:51.490]  You destabilize.
[02:24:51.490 --> 02:24:52.991]  Energy is the great equalizer.
[02:24:52.991 --> 02:24:56.013]  Yeah, so why are the Democrats trying to take energy from us?
[02:24:56.013 --> 02:24:58.674]  Why did Joe Biden shut our energy down?
[02:24:58.674 --> 02:24:59.615]  And so that's what I'm saying.
[02:24:59.615 --> 02:25:03.658]  I feel like I'm being redundant, but it's all right there.
[02:25:03.658 --> 02:25:04.919]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:25:04.919 --> 02:25:05.459]  It's 2.
[02:25:05.459 --> 02:25:05.619]  It's 2.
[02:25:05.619 --> 02:25:06.119]  It's 2.
[02:25:06.119 --> 02:25:06.279]  It's 2.
[02:25:06.279 --> 02:25:06.780]  It's 2.
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:06.920]  It's 2.
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:07.160]  It's 2.
[02:25:11.533 --> 02:25:13.054]  This is 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:25:13.054 --> 02:25:26.200]  Here's the liberals telling you it's terrorism to sabotage a power plant for an ulterior political motive, and then here's the Democrats sabotaging your power plants for an ulterior political motive.
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:32.803]  So by Frank Figluzzi's own conclusion, Democrats and liberals are terrorists.
[02:25:34.749 --> 02:25:35.850]  Not my logic.
[02:25:35.850 --> 02:25:38.091]  I just played you the clip of Frank Figluzzi.
[02:25:38.091 --> 02:25:39.952]  I just played you the clip of John Kerry.
[02:25:39.952 --> 02:25:44.615]  You've been living their new green energy agenda.
[02:25:46.229 --> 02:25:47.069]  1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:25:47.069 --> 02:25:48.030]  1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:49.390]  1 plus 1 equals 2.
[02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:50.931]  I should be able to quit.
[02:25:50.931 --> 02:25:52.652]  I should be able to retire.
[02:25:52.652 --> 02:26:01.215]  I should never have to fight this man-made climate change, stop man-made climate change, green new agenda bullcrap ever again.
[02:26:01.215 --> 02:26:03.756]  Frank Figluzzi just killed it in the womb.
[02:26:03.756 --> 02:26:05.157]  It should be done!
[02:26:05.157 --> 02:26:05.997]  Their own guy!
[02:26:06.317 --> 02:26:18.300]  Their own idiot, their own moron, their own corrupt son of a bitch goes on TV and tells you, when you sabotage the energy, that's an act of terror to destabilize and conquer.
[02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:22.361]  By the way, we're sabotaging your energy to destabilize and conquer.
[02:26:22.361 --> 02:26:23.862]  We're good liberal Democrats.
[02:26:23.862 --> 02:26:24.122]  Gay!
[02:26:26.271 --> 02:26:27.852]  So I should be done, that should be it.
[02:26:27.852 --> 02:26:36.799]  We shouldn't have to fight this fight anymore, we shouldn't have to battle it, but it didn't matter because it didn't stop with the Vostok ice core samples completely proving the whole thing wrong.
[02:26:36.799 --> 02:26:44.245]  It didn't stop with the ice caps expanding when they told you they'd all be completely melted.
[02:26:44.245 --> 02:26:49.549]  I mean, folks, you understand, again, I don't want to get too esoteric here, but it's important.
[02:26:49.549 --> 02:26:53.412]  Like, you understand, you've been completely lied to about human history.
[02:26:54.522 --> 02:26:57.903]  You have been completely lied to about human history.
[02:26:57.903 --> 02:27:00.224]  And it all does tie together, actually.
[02:27:00.224 --> 02:27:08.488]  Because they can't have you knowing the truth about human history because it once again disproves their theory of man-made climate change.
[02:27:08.488 --> 02:27:16.751]  They want you to think that the arc of human evolution is a straight line like this, just going up like this.
[02:27:16.751 --> 02:27:23.794]  This is what mainline history and science wants you to believe, that it's just from the bottom up, a straight line up.
[02:27:24.790 --> 02:27:26.231]  That is a lie.
[02:27:26.231 --> 02:27:27.952]  They know it's a lie.
[02:27:27.952 --> 02:27:32.376]  Mankind has survived three, four, maybe even five ice ages.
[02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:41.723]  We don't have the exact science in dating, but it looks like it's on a cyclical period of about every 3,000 years, all based off the sun's activity.
[02:27:41.723 --> 02:27:43.944]  And they know this.
[02:27:43.944 --> 02:27:52.251]  And they know that in prior times on planet Earth, where we didn't have an industrial age, there was more carbon in the atmosphere.
[02:27:53.971 --> 02:28:00.517]  This is all documented, it's all out there, and they just keep lying to you about it.
[02:28:00.517 --> 02:28:02.419]  So why would you ever trust a liar?
[02:28:02.419 --> 02:28:04.701]  Well, you wouldn't, would you?
[02:28:04.701 --> 02:28:17.852]  And I guess that's the ultimate hill that we still have to climb, is to convince people, everybody telling you, well maybe not everybody, some of them are just genuine morons, but the leaders of this Green New Agenda, the leaders of this
[02:28:18.931 --> 02:28:23.135]  Stop Man-Made Climate Change Movement are liars!
[02:28:23.135 --> 02:28:32.965]  And they're going off years and decades and centuries and millennia of lies!
[02:28:32.965 --> 02:28:35.267]  They will not win.
[02:28:35.267 --> 02:28:37.349]  You will not conquer the planet.
[02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:39.431]  You will not turn off our energy.
[02:28:39.431 --> 02:28:41.634]  You will not crush civilization.
[02:28:43.342 --> 02:28:47.186]  We have survived much worse than you.
[02:28:47.186 --> 02:28:49.068]  And we will have to again.
[02:28:49.068 --> 02:28:56.076]  But my God, how much longer do we have to sit here and show you what scumbag lying criminals they are?
[02:28:58.356 --> 02:29:07.980]  Christmas 2022 is almost here, and we have great products at InfoWarsTore.com that empower your body, your libido, your immune system, that just enrich your life.

[02:29:15.343 --> 02:29:16.043]  And now, finally,

[02:29:34.381 --> 02:29:41.068]  So again, that's free shipping on all orders, $50 or more at infowarestore.com.
[02:29:41.348 --> 02:29:41.949]  We're good to go!
[02:29:58.357 --> 02:30:09.662]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:30:09.662 --> 02:30:11.563]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:30:11.563 --> 02:30:13.023]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:30:13.023 --> 02:30:14.544]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:30:14.544 --> 02:30:16.245]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:30:16.245 --> 02:30:17.525]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:30:17.525 --> 02:30:18.906]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:30:19.346 --> 02:30:24.190]  I studied The Globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:30:24.190 --> 02:30:26.573]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[02:30:26.573 --> 02:30:28.594]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:30:28.594 --> 02:30:35.541]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to The Globalist agenda.
[02:30:36.181 --> 02:30:41.567]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:30:41.567 --> 02:30:50.518]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:30:50.518 --> 02:30:52.880]  1776 is the promo code.
[02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:56.805]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:30:58.248 --> 02:31:09.736]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:31:09.736 --> 02:31:14.179]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:31:14.179 --> 02:31:18.162]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:31:18.162 --> 02:31:21.644]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:31:21.644 --> 02:31:22.885]  You see, the sun
[02:31:24.386 --> 02:31:24.706]  We're good
[02:31:48.738 --> 02:31:49.500]  We're good to go.
[02:31:58.160 --> 02:32:06.705]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[02:32:06.705 --> 02:32:11.167]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously.
[02:32:11.167 --> 02:32:14.769]  It's election month, Alex.
[02:32:14.769 --> 02:32:16.330]  It's not election day.
[02:32:16.330 --> 02:32:17.431]  And that's the problem.
[02:32:17.431 --> 02:32:20.772]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[02:32:20.772 --> 02:32:23.534]  They illegally changed state elections.
[02:32:24.434 --> 02:32:29.976]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[02:32:29.976 --> 02:32:31.976]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[02:32:31.976 --> 02:32:36.257]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[02:32:36.257 --> 02:32:51.341]  And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections
[02:32:52.101 --> 02:32:54.203]  Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[02:32:54.203 --> 02:32:59.106]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists.
[02:32:59.106 --> 02:33:04.991]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:12.688 --> 02:33:15.189]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:15.189 --> 02:33:20.811]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:20.811 --> 02:33:23.712]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:23.712 --> 02:33:33.915]  Alright, I'm gonna calm down here and get back into the news.
[02:33:33.915 --> 02:33:35.456]  It's just frustrating, you know?
[02:33:36.793 --> 02:33:50.279]  It's just frustrating the double standard and the lies and when it's just right out there in front of your face with their own words and yet you still have to sit here and fight them when they're admitting everything they're doing is to crush you and destroy you.
[02:33:50.279 --> 02:33:55.120]  But let's just get into some of the headlines here.
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:59.862]  Before I do that, folks have been asking, hey, what happened to free shipping?
[02:33:59.862 --> 02:34:02.543]  We used to have free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com all the time.
[02:34:02.543 --> 02:34:04.704]  It saved us a bunch of money on our purchases.
[02:34:04.704 --> 02:34:05.765]  Where did the free shipping go?
[02:34:05.765 --> 02:34:05.945]  Well,
[02:34:07.438 --> 02:34:14.366]  We've had to make some changes around here with some of the recent situations you're familiar with, obviously.
[02:34:14.366 --> 02:34:23.336]  But some of the changes are starting to reach their conclusions, and we've got a new shipping deal worked out, and so free shipping is back!
[02:34:25.217 --> 02:34:25.557]  Thank you.
[02:34:42.350 --> 02:34:47.353]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, by the way, selling out fast, so I would load up on that.
[02:34:47.353 --> 02:34:56.138]  If you're a regular consumer like myself, I did reload and I got about five, I think, Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:34:56.138 --> 02:35:01.942]  I got about five in my pantry when I first bought it, but now I'm down to, I think, one, so I may have to make a bulk purchase myself.
[02:35:01.942 --> 02:35:04.383]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, I start every day with it.
[02:35:04.383 --> 02:35:05.724]  I suggest you do the same.
[02:35:07.145 --> 02:35:19.413]  The label for all the different vitamins and minerals that you get 100% of your daily value in with just one serving, and you will see why I start every day with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, but it's selling out quick, so take advantage.
[02:35:19.413 --> 02:35:26.377]  50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:35:26.377 --> 02:35:30.160]  Okay, let's just start pile driving through some of these news stories.
[02:35:30.799 --> 02:35:32.180]  Gateway Pundit was right.
[02:35:32.180 --> 02:35:38.425]  Arizona media PR company find impossible variant in election day data.
[02:35:38.425 --> 02:35:43.269]  25% of GOP voters flipped their votes on top GOP candidates.
[02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:55.339]  Folks, this story, I think, is actually just beginning because they just got their hands on more data that shows, I mean, basically,
[02:35:57.366 --> 02:36:03.909]  To kind of just get to the bottom line here, about, I forget, I crunched the numbers yesterday on the show.
[02:36:03.909 --> 02:36:04.870]  Do you guys remember?
[02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:10.732]  I think it was about 120,000 more Republicans voted in the Arizona election in Maricopa County.
[02:36:10.732 --> 02:36:11.993]  Do you guys remember that number I landed on?
[02:36:11.993 --> 02:36:12.433]  I don't remember.
[02:36:12.433 --> 02:36:15.395]  I did the math on the screen with the latest data.
[02:36:15.395 --> 02:36:21.978]  But basically, Republicans outvoted Democrats in Maricopa County by more than 100,000.
[02:36:21.978 --> 02:36:25.960]  And yet somehow the Democrats had a better turnout.
[02:36:27.577 --> 02:36:30.358]  In the results.
[02:36:30.358 --> 02:36:49.286]  And now we're learning with new data that it's not just the anomaly of more Republican voters, it's that the anomaly of how come some Republicans voted for this Republican candidate but not for this Democrat at such a high rate.
[02:36:49.286 --> 02:36:50.507]  And that happened in Georgia too.
[02:36:52.478 --> 02:37:03.449]  So it just leads to more questions, and it just leads to more distrust in our election system, which at this point, how could you not?
[02:37:03.449 --> 02:37:16.141]  Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer attacks the Gateway Pundit in meeting with federal agency CISA and Twitter chief censor Vijaya Gadeh, attacks the Gateway Pundit completely factual and sourced report on secret county meeting.
[02:37:17.574 --> 02:37:24.822]  Yeah, they're mad because the Gateway Pundit publishes this stuff and they've got eyes and ears usually right there.
[02:37:24.822 --> 02:37:32.510]  And then they go on to talk shows like here at Infowars with Jim Hoft on the War Room with me yesterday and they expose it all and so then they get attacked for it.
[02:37:33.939 --> 02:37:40.425]  Karine Jean-Pierre refuses to say if the Biden campaign communicated with Twitter to suppress Hunter Biden laptop story.
[02:37:40.425 --> 02:37:42.027]  Now, why does she refuse to say?
[02:37:42.027 --> 02:37:44.409]  Because the answer is, yes, they did.
[02:37:44.409 --> 02:37:48.413]  And we have the emails and the phone calls and the whistleblowers.
[02:37:49.013 --> 02:37:57.136]  So we have all the evidence that yes, the Biden campaign did communicate and she won't answer the question because she knows if she's asked directly yes or no, did they?
[02:37:57.136 --> 02:37:58.697]  She has to say yes.
[02:37:58.697 --> 02:38:00.257]  I don't know why lying is such a problem.
[02:38:00.257 --> 02:38:02.038]  She does it all day for a living.
[02:38:02.038 --> 02:38:04.379]  So I don't know why she doesn't just doesn't say no.
[02:38:04.379 --> 02:38:05.659]  Maybe that lies too big.
[02:38:05.659 --> 02:38:09.541]  Maybe even Jen or maybe Jean-Pierre even has limits to how much she'll lie.
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:18.143]  CDC and Census Bureau had direct access to Twitter portal where they could flag speech for censorship.
[02:38:18.143 --> 02:38:21.084]  That's a direct violation of the First Amendment.
[02:38:21.084 --> 02:38:25.206]  There need to be massive criminal investigations and charges.
[02:38:25.206 --> 02:38:29.488]  I mean, you want to talk about seditious conspiracy, forget J6.
[02:38:29.488 --> 02:38:33.429]  You want to talk about treason, do we need to start throwing the T-word around here?
[02:38:33.429 --> 02:38:34.690]  How serious do we need to get?
[02:38:34.690 --> 02:38:36.031]  It needs to start somewhere.
[02:38:37.031 --> 02:38:41.937]  According to Elon Musk, some data was likely hidden and deleted from the Twitter files.
[02:38:41.937 --> 02:38:43.939]  Now this is, this is odd and it's not...
[02:38:45.211 --> 02:38:53.637]  Maybe it's not as odd as we think because Twitter is a much bigger business, a much bigger company than InfoWars, but I can understand.
[02:38:53.637 --> 02:38:55.518]  I mean, just a company of InfoWars here.
[02:38:55.518 --> 02:38:58.320]  I mean, I could sabotage things.
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:01.303]  I mean, somebody could sabotage this whole thing right now.
[02:39:01.303 --> 02:39:03.424]  Somebody in the crew could just shut it down.
[02:39:03.424 --> 02:39:05.225]  Somebody could go pull the plug in the back.
[02:39:05.225 --> 02:39:07.947]  Somebody could go delete all the archives.
[02:39:07.947 --> 02:39:12.831]  So I can understand maybe if Elon Musk not getting control, complete control of the company,
[02:39:14.716 --> 02:39:16.697]  I could understand maybe that's a possibility.
[02:39:16.697 --> 02:39:18.958]  Twitter's a huge company and you could have bad actors.
[02:39:18.958 --> 02:39:31.285]  But how it's Jim Baker, how it's James Baker, known federal lawyer, known Democrat lawyer that's in there doing this, that's stunning how that was able to get through the filter.
[02:39:31.285 --> 02:39:36.948]  I can understand maybe, you know, you got a bunch of employees, maybe some low-level employees, maybe somebody tried to sabotage you, but Jim Baker?
[02:39:36.948 --> 02:39:38.829]  Like, top Democrat lawyers in there?
[02:39:38.829 --> 02:39:39.370]  FBI guy?
[02:39:42.441 --> 02:39:43.742]  That's crazy.
[02:39:43.742 --> 02:39:52.547]  And so who are they saying might have hidden or deleted some of the Twitter files?
[02:39:52.547 --> 02:39:59.311]  He's got to be referring to Baker, who he fired recently.
[02:39:59.311 --> 02:40:09.618]  Just a swamp member who was put as the head communications, Twitter's deputy general counsel, who is basically steering the entire
[02:40:10.776 --> 02:40:11.176]  We're good to go.
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:39.087]  But good for Jack Dorsey saying, hey Elon, stop playing these games, release the whole thing.
[02:40:39.087 --> 02:40:41.731]  I think Elon's got his own little game of cat and mouse going on.
[02:40:41.731 --> 02:40:49.382]  Hopefully it's for the good of the people and not just himself, but that saga isn't going anywhere.
[02:40:49.382 --> 02:40:50.764]  Senator Marsha Blackburn.
[02:40:52.472 --> 02:40:57.494]  Open App Markets Act would remove Apple and Google as the gatekeepers on smartphones.
[02:40:57.494 --> 02:40:59.655]  Hey, this is wow!
[02:40:59.655 --> 02:41:03.316]  Marsha Blackburn is starting to have some forward thinking here.
[02:41:03.316 --> 02:41:05.057]  Thank God!
[02:41:05.057 --> 02:41:07.317]  Somebody gets it.
[02:41:07.317 --> 02:41:10.578]  And of course, it was InfoWars that reported this first.
[02:41:10.578 --> 02:41:13.279]  Myself, even.
[02:41:13.279 --> 02:41:14.420]  Over a month ago, I said,
[02:41:15.635 --> 02:41:22.761]  Google Play and Apple are threatening Elon Musk that they're going to remove his app from the platform if he doesn't keep Alex Jones censored.
[02:41:22.761 --> 02:41:28.446]  And then, a couple weeks later after I reported that, he came out and said that that's exactly what happened.
[02:41:28.446 --> 02:41:29.587]  And so, what do you do?
[02:41:29.587 --> 02:41:40.517]  What do you do when you have this duo, duopoly system, while maintaining a free market capitalist, you know, country?
[02:41:40.517 --> 02:41:41.358]  It's okay, well,
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.740]  Maybe this is a solution.
[02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:47.741]  Open App Markets Act.
[02:41:47.741 --> 02:41:53.482]  Now, at the end of the day, I don't really know how this goes, because I don't think there's going to be enough support behind Marsha Blackburn.
[02:41:53.482 --> 02:41:54.202]  Maybe there will.
[02:41:54.202 --> 02:42:02.603]  I don't think enough Republicans are forward-thinking enough, or have the courage enough to do something good like this.
[02:42:02.603 --> 02:42:10.845]  But, ultimately, I think Elon Musk realizes he's going to have to make his own smartphone, and he's going to have to make his own operating system.
[02:42:12.048 --> 02:42:29.919]  And my guess is, once he's gotten comfortable with wherever he's at, at Twitter, and by the way, they launched an investigation in San Francisco because he has bedrooms at Twitter headquarters, and then they found out that he was the one sleeping there.
[02:42:29.919 --> 02:42:34.402]  It was Elon Musk who's been living at Twitter since he made the purchase.
[02:42:34.402 --> 02:42:38.545]  So when he's not flying around the country, he's living at Twitter, working on Twitter.
[02:42:40.717 --> 02:42:41.939]  And then they, oh, we're investigating.
[02:42:41.939 --> 02:42:43.101]  He's making people sleep here.
[02:42:43.101 --> 02:42:45.285]  Well, he was the one sleeping there.
[02:42:45.285 --> 02:42:48.250]  But, oh, well, then why didn't he just send them out to the streets?
[02:42:48.250 --> 02:42:52.498]  And then they could sleep on the streets like everyone else in San Francisco does, that they tell you is so great.
[02:42:52.498 --> 02:42:53.479]  They can get a free needle, too.
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:04.841]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[02:43:04.841 --> 02:43:10.402]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[02:43:10.402 --> 02:43:12.903]  But thank God that we have you.
[02:43:12.903 --> 02:43:19.344]  All of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.
[02:43:19.344 --> 02:43:24.045]  It's your love, our love, that makes all of this possible.
[02:43:25.005 --> 02:43:35.071]  And if you feel like showing us some love today and help keep us on the air, you can do so at infowarestore.com.
[02:43:35.071 --> 02:43:43.096]  Products that will make your life better and allow us to keep broadcasting free worldwide.
[02:43:43.096 --> 02:43:46.638]  We are all in this together through thick and thin.
[02:43:46.638 --> 02:43:51.361]  On behalf of the whole crew, we love you and we thank you for your support.
[02:43:58.562 --> 02:44:05.488]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life.
[02:44:05.488 --> 02:44:11.373]  InfoWars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system with a supplement that contains both.
[02:44:11.373 --> 02:44:17.718]  This InfoWars Life Offering Vitamin C Plus Zinc with Rose Hips should be your next purchase from the InfoWars store.
[02:44:18.058 --> 02:44:25.285]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[02:44:25.285 --> 02:44:35.574]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery, studies have shown.
[02:44:35.994 --> 02:44:44.977]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[02:44:44.977 --> 02:44:51.159]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[02:44:51.579 --> 02:44:58.064]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[02:44:58.064 --> 02:45:09.132]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:45:09.352 --> 02:45:11.254]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:45:11.254 --> 02:45:12.715]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:45:12.715 --> 02:45:14.236]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:45:14.236 --> 02:45:15.978]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:45:15.978 --> 02:45:17.199]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:45:17.199 --> 02:45:19.040]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:21.682]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[02:45:21.682 --> 02:45:23.884]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:45:23.884 --> 02:45:26.286]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:45:26.286 --> 02:45:28.308]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:45:28.308 --> 02:45:35.214]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:45:35.874 --> 02:45:41.259]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:45:41.259 --> 02:45:50.208]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[02:45:58.277 --> 02:46:05.262]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[02:46:05.262 --> 02:46:10.465]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[02:46:10.465 --> 02:46:17.370]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[02:46:17.370 --> 02:46:20.632]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[02:46:21.532 --> 02:46:25.695]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.

[02:46:45.108 --> 02:46:49.071]  And we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[02:46:59.085 --> 02:47:05.003]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[02:47:22.830 --> 02:47:29.844]  Paul Joseph Watson is coming up to host the fourth hour, and then I will be back to host the war room.
[02:47:29.844 --> 02:47:32.489]  And right out of the gates, we're going to have the lawyer on.
[02:47:33.683 --> 02:47:37.424]  The parents that were featured on the Alex Jones Show yesterday just lost their child.
[02:47:37.424 --> 02:47:39.925]  So they had it with them on the air yesterday.
[02:47:39.925 --> 02:47:41.825]  They were holding it, loving embrace.
[02:47:41.825 --> 02:47:47.346]  And then the totalitarians, the good commies, the good liberals came and took the baby away.
[02:47:47.346 --> 02:47:51.787]  New Zealand takes custody of baby over parents' transfusion objection.
[02:47:51.787 --> 02:47:59.209]  New Zealand parents who lost custody of baby for demanding unvaxed blood donors join InfoWars to expose medical tyranny.
[02:47:59.209 --> 02:48:02.050]  And I've got their whole statement here.
[02:48:03.226 --> 02:48:13.696]  I'm going to read for you the entire statement, and then again, the lawyer of this family will be joining me at 3.06 Central Time.
[02:48:14.844 --> 02:48:20.388]  To discuss further, here's the official statement that we have been given exclusively.
[02:48:20.388 --> 02:48:25.493]  Four police officers entered the room where Baby Will and his twin brother slept soundly.
[02:48:25.493 --> 02:48:27.734]  Without notice, they seized him.
[02:48:27.734 --> 02:48:38.343]  In the words of Will's father, quote, Baby Will has tonight been ripped from his bed and his mom in a display of ultimate cowardice by masked police dressed as police.
[02:48:38.783 --> 02:48:51.006]  Masked people dressed as police at 11 o'clock at night to be made to undergo invasive procedures before being forced against our will to have a rushed and unprepared for surgery."
[02:48:51.006 --> 02:48:52.146]  End quote.
[02:48:52.146 --> 02:49:03.588]  This happened despite last minute efforts by the family's legal team and experts from across the world who were studying his case and making the recommendations that were then passed to the judge on the case.
[02:49:03.588 --> 02:49:05.609]  Now his life is in the hands of the hospital staff.
[02:49:06.269 --> 02:49:11.870]  Let's hope for Will's sake they see sense and provide him with an uncontaminated blood supply.
[02:49:11.870 --> 02:49:17.871]  I've talked to Sam since she was allowed to join baby Will after he was taken at midnight.
[02:49:17.871 --> 02:49:20.872]  I've also texted evidence.
[02:49:20.872 --> 02:49:23.012]  She is exhausted and very scared.
[02:49:23.012 --> 02:49:32.013]  They have imposed a condition that she can only stay with her baby if she stays awake even though it's from midnight to 8am and both babies are sleeping.
[02:49:32.013 --> 02:49:34.874]  The police are trailing her even to the toilet.
[02:49:35.274 --> 02:49:38.616]  They told her this was due to orders from above.
[02:49:38.616 --> 02:49:41.837]  The policewoman let slip they intend to arrest Sam in the morning.
[02:49:41.837 --> 02:49:43.158]  Sam doesn't know why.
[02:49:43.158 --> 02:49:46.199]  We need an urgent support communications and support plan.
[02:49:46.199 --> 02:49:48.540]  We must protect Will and Jethro.
[02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:51.861]  Protect legal privilege so far as possible.
[02:49:51.861 --> 02:49:54.042]  I'm guessing they will try to close me down too.
[02:49:54.042 --> 02:49:55.743]  I plan to get to the hospital at 7 a.m.
[02:49:55.743 --> 02:49:56.423]  to support Sam.
[02:49:56.423 --> 02:49:59.485]  So different time zone obviously over there in New Zealand.
[02:50:00.342 --> 02:50:04.585]  So I think this is going to be all going on right around by the time the lawyer comes on with me.
[02:50:04.585 --> 02:50:08.988]  So following that heartbreaking story, this is the corporate world government.
[02:50:08.988 --> 02:50:19.255]  This is medical tyranny, medical fascism that has been really cemented into our civilization post-COVID.
[02:50:19.255 --> 02:50:20.856]  This is what communism looks like.
[02:50:20.856 --> 02:50:23.498]  This is what totalitarianism looks like.
[02:50:23.498 --> 02:50:24.739]  Your child is not yours.
[02:50:27.213 --> 02:50:32.896]  Just like Democrat Melissa Harris Perry said, your child is not yours, it belongs to the larger community.
[02:50:32.896 --> 02:50:36.619]  In other words, it belongs to them.
[02:50:36.619 --> 02:50:51.007]  So they can't convince you that you belong to them, but that's why they're going after your children, that's why they're confusing them with the gender stuff, that's why they're mutilating them with the surgeries, that's why they're poisoning them with the vaccines,
[02:50:53.413 --> 02:50:56.236]  It's all about turning them into slaves.
[02:50:56.236 --> 02:50:58.118]  It's too late for you.
[02:50:58.118 --> 02:51:00.601]  Your limits of slavery have been tested.
[02:51:00.601 --> 02:51:08.950]  You've only been able to deal and put up with so much, but the children, they're really going hard for them.
[02:51:08.950 --> 02:51:11.974]  And so we should pray for baby Will.
[02:51:11.974 --> 02:51:12.675]  I mean, ugh.
[02:51:14.926 --> 02:51:22.232]  I mean, you don't even want to think about the worst case scenario that the baby gets contaminated blood, then has a heart attack, a blood clot, dies.
[02:51:22.232 --> 02:51:25.014]  Obviously, that's the concern.
[02:51:25.014 --> 02:51:26.815]  But that shouldn't even be the concern.
[02:51:26.815 --> 02:51:29.177]  The concern has already been breached.
[02:51:29.177 --> 02:51:38.804]  The concern is that you as a parent no longer have control over medical decisions that are made for your baby.
[02:51:38.804 --> 02:51:39.145]  That's
[02:51:40.472 --> 02:51:41.653]  The problem here.
[02:51:41.653 --> 02:51:48.256]  Not, oh well, let's hope that baby Will gets good blood that won't kill him.
[02:51:48.256 --> 02:51:50.197]  That's totally against the parents' wishes.
[02:51:50.197 --> 02:51:55.439]  They don't want him to get contaminated blood, but the doctors may force him to do it.
[02:51:55.439 --> 02:51:56.820]  That's the situation right now.
[02:51:56.820 --> 02:52:07.825]  No, it's, do parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children instead of the government or the state?
[02:52:07.825 --> 02:52:08.866]  That's already been breached.
[02:52:11.232 --> 02:52:12.112]  And now here you are.
[02:52:12.112 --> 02:52:13.433]  This is liberalism.
[02:52:13.433 --> 02:52:16.014]  This is the left-wing ideology.
[02:52:16.014 --> 02:52:17.675]  They're coming out of their shell.
[02:52:17.675 --> 02:52:19.995]  They're showing you who they are.
[02:52:19.995 --> 02:52:22.116]  Will you take them in?
[02:52:22.116 --> 02:52:23.557]  Will you accept them?
[02:52:30.923 --> 02:52:32.064]  Now, this is crazy.
[02:52:32.064 --> 02:52:35.366]  You want to see the other angle of these freaks?
[02:52:35.366 --> 02:52:38.028]  They don't just want the medical control over your child.
[02:52:38.028 --> 02:52:40.470]  They want sexual control over them, too.
[02:52:40.470 --> 02:52:42.932]  Project Veritas video.
[02:52:42.932 --> 02:52:50.037]  Elite Chicago private school's dean of students brags about teaching queer sex to minors and giving them butt plugs.
[02:52:50.037 --> 02:52:52.919]  Folks, it's so disgusting, but it is the truth.
[02:52:52.919 --> 02:52:53.659]  We have the video.
[02:52:54.540 --> 02:53:00.284]  And so these people are bragging about how they groom and sexualize children in the classroom in undercover video.
[02:53:00.284 --> 02:53:07.989]  Project Veritas caught up with these scumbags in the streets and it went like this in clip 14.
[02:53:11.198 --> 02:53:13.779]  Like our LGBTQ Plus Health Center come in.
[02:53:13.779 --> 02:53:21.661]  They were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students, talking about queer sex, using glue versus using spit.
[02:53:21.661 --> 02:53:29.444]  Meet Joe Bruno, Dean of Students at the prestigious Francis W. Parker Private School in Chicago, which happens to charge $40,000 per student.
[02:53:31.144 --> 02:53:34.086]  They're just like passing around dildos, butt plugs.
[02:53:34.086 --> 02:53:35.567]  The kids are just playing with them.
[02:53:35.567 --> 02:53:37.869]  They're like, how do you, how does this book work?
[02:53:37.869 --> 02:53:40.371]  How do I do, like, how does this work?
[02:53:40.371 --> 02:53:43.113]  That's a really, like, new part of my job.
[02:53:43.113 --> 02:53:51.700]  Parents might be stunned to learn that Bruno's version of love and acceptance means handing out sex toys to underage students.
[02:53:51.700 --> 02:53:53.781]  So I've been on the team for four years.
[02:53:53.781 --> 02:53:58.945]  During Pride, we do a Pride week every year, and I had, um,
[02:54:01.102 --> 02:54:04.586]  I had, like, our LGBTQ Plus Health Center come in.
[02:54:04.586 --> 02:54:12.373]  They were passing around butt plugs and dildos to my students, talking about queer sex, using lube versus using spit.
[02:54:12.373 --> 02:54:13.414]  Who is this?
[02:54:13.414 --> 02:54:18.239]  This is, uh, an LGBTQ Plus Health Center came in to talk to my high school students.
[02:54:18.239 --> 02:54:21.202]  They're just, like, passing around dildos and butt plugs.
[02:54:21.202 --> 02:54:22.663]  The kids are just playing with them.
[02:54:22.663 --> 02:54:23.564]  They're looking at them.
[02:54:23.564 --> 02:54:24.585]  In the school?
[02:54:24.585 --> 02:54:25.326]  In a classroom.
[02:54:25.726 --> 02:54:25.966]  Yeah.
[02:54:25.966 --> 02:54:27.647]  Well, I'm sitting there.
[02:54:27.647 --> 02:54:33.932]  And we had a drag queen come in, pass out cookies and brownies and do photos.
[02:54:33.932 --> 02:54:34.973]  It's so amazing.
[02:54:34.973 --> 02:54:35.993]  And everybody's cool with that.
[02:54:35.993 --> 02:54:38.035]  Like, they're about clothes and their dildos.
[02:54:38.035 --> 02:54:39.556]  Nobody complains.
[02:54:39.556 --> 02:54:41.497]  I mean, if the parents found out, would they?
[02:54:43.018 --> 02:54:43.538]  It's queer sex.
[02:54:43.538 --> 02:54:44.398]  This is the drag queen that came in.
[02:54:44.398 --> 02:54:44.799]  What's her name?
[02:54:44.799 --> 02:54:45.179]  Uh, Alexis Bevels.
[02:54:45.179 --> 02:54:45.459]  Alexis Bevels.
[02:54:45.459 --> 02:54:46.299]  I just hung out in my classroom.
[02:54:46.299 --> 02:54:46.779]  Was there a girl?
[02:54:46.779 --> 02:54:47.279]  I hung out in my office.
[02:54:47.279 --> 02:54:47.819]  You have so much freedom.
[02:54:47.819 --> 02:54:47.999]  So much.
[02:54:47.999 --> 02:54:48.319]  Wiggle girl.
[02:54:48.319 --> 02:54:48.900]  So much freedom.
[02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:49.320]  So much money.
[02:54:49.320 --> 02:54:49.760]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:50.280]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:50.940]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:50.940 --> 02:54:51.340]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:51.340 --> 02:54:51.840]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:52.400]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:52.881]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:52.881 --> 02:54:53.401]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:53.401 --> 02:54:54.301]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:54.301 --> 02:54:54.861]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:54.861 --> 02:54:55.301]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:55.301 --> 02:54:55.921]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:55.921 --> 02:54:57.662]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:57.662 --> 02:54:58.182]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:58.182 --> 02:54:58.702]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:58.702 --> 02:54:59.082]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:54:59.082 --> 02:55:00.022]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:00.022 --> 02:55:00.663]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:00.663 --> 02:55:01.223]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:01.223 --> 02:55:01.903]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:01.903 --> 02:55:02.323]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:02.323 --> 02:55:02.883]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:02.883 --> 02:55:03.383]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:03.383 --> 02:55:03.763]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:03.763 --> 02:55:05.284]  I mean, weird stuff.
[02:55:05.284 --> 02:55:05.444]  I mean
[02:55:07.148 --> 02:55:09.089]  Man, I just... How much do we have to put up with?
[02:55:37.978 --> 02:55:52.966]  You know, I don't have a kid in school, so this is a societal issue for me that's a pretty easy one to take a stance on, but if you had a kid in that school and you heard this, I mean, what are the odds?
[02:55:52.966 --> 02:55:55.267]  This guy seems to be pretty obsessed with butt plugs.
[02:55:55.267 --> 02:55:58.589]  What are the odds he's wearing one in that interview?
[02:55:58.589 --> 02:56:06.893]  What are the odds he's got one in while the kids are in class and he's wriggling around in the chair looking at the little boys and girls getting off to it?
[02:56:06.893 --> 02:56:07.053]  Yeah.
[02:56:08.732 --> 02:56:20.995]  You really think a guy that talks like that and is that audacious about grooming and sexualizing children wouldn't... you'd put that past him?
[02:56:20.995 --> 02:56:23.576]  These people are completely insane.
[02:56:23.576 --> 02:56:28.897]  They belong in mental institutions, not in classrooms.
[02:56:28.897 --> 02:56:32.098]  They belong on lists that warn parents about predators.
[02:56:34.833 --> 02:56:40.117]  Radical pro-trans college professor won't let her daughter watch shows with white boy leads.
[02:56:40.117 --> 02:56:40.738]  She's white, by the way.
[02:56:42.776 --> 02:56:45.478]  Yeah, those white guys, they're awfully bad.
[02:56:45.478 --> 02:56:49.981]  It's kind of like when Jennifer Lawrence was like, oh, you know, I was the first female lead ever.
[02:56:49.981 --> 02:56:54.404]  We weren't sure it was going to be successful with The Hunger Games, me being the first female lead.
[02:56:54.404 --> 02:57:08.053]  And the entire movie industry and fans of movies were like, hey, hey, you narcissistic bimbo, have you ever heard of this list of movies, which is just, you know, dozens of movies with strong female leads?
[02:57:08.053 --> 02:57:11.195]  Tomb Raider, Alien, the list just goes on.
[02:57:11.195 --> 02:57:12.396]  But she had to make it all about her.
[02:57:13.516 --> 02:57:14.837]  And that's what it's really all about at the end of the day.
[02:57:14.837 --> 02:57:16.217]  It's just all about them.
[02:57:16.217 --> 02:57:26.100]  That individual, the Dean of Students there, he's obviously got his own weird sexual preferences and so he wants to use that and bring that into the children.
[02:57:26.100 --> 02:57:28.001]  He wants to make that fun with the children.
[02:57:28.001 --> 02:57:28.821]  It's all about him.
[02:57:30.034 --> 02:57:34.498]  Woke military threatens mother who questioned LGBTQ school indoctrination.
[02:57:34.498 --> 02:57:36.800]  Oh, you don't like us grooming your kids?
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:39.202]  You don't like us mainstreaming pedophilia?
[02:57:39.202 --> 02:57:41.624]  We're gonna send the military after you!
[02:57:41.624 --> 02:57:43.966]  This is Biden's America!
[02:57:48.652 --> 02:57:57.476]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.

[02:58:18.086 --> 02:58:19.627]  We're so excited about it.
[02:58:19.627 --> 02:58:21.888]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[02:58:21.888 --> 02:58:26.311]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[02:58:26.311 --> 02:58:29.413]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.
[02:58:29.413 --> 02:58:31.874]  The same great customer service and more.

[02:58:48.573 --> 02:59:00.059]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:59:00.059 --> 02:59:04.522]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:59:04.522 --> 02:59:08.484]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:59:08.484 --> 02:59:11.825]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:59:11.825 --> 02:59:13.226]  You see, the sun
[02:59:14.707 --> 02:59:15.007]  We're good to
[02:59:38.613 --> 02:59:40.914]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:26.856]  Transmuting worldwide, from the Summit.nu studios in United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:30.042 --> 03:00:35.984]  It is the Summit News Hour for this December 8th, 2022 edition.
[03:00:35.984 --> 03:00:52.789]  Gonna cover a whole host of stories over the course of the next hour and yes, we're gonna get into the Harry and Meghan self-victimhood, race-baiting, grievance, pity party with the launch of their self-obsessed new Netflix special.
[03:00:52.789 --> 03:00:56.470]  They've dropped three episodes today, another three episodes coming.
[03:00:56.470 --> 03:00:57.610]  The people behind it
[03:00:58.217 --> 03:01:02.019]  The narratives, the false narratives that they're pushing, of course.
[03:01:02.019 --> 03:01:18.566]  Prince Harry got up in front of the UN not too long ago, and not only did he talk about the planet literally being on fire, as he of course takes private jet trips around the world, including to pick up a climate change award, he also talked about the threat of disinformation.
[03:01:19.338 --> 03:01:26.561]  Well, even in the first 30 seconds of their trailer for this Netflix special, there were numerous examples of disinformation.
[03:01:26.561 --> 03:01:31.322]  We're going to talk about some of the fallout that's happened as a result of that.
[03:01:31.322 --> 03:01:46.048]  We're also going to talk about climate lockdowns, because if you remember back during the coronavirus lockdowns, which were proven to be an unscientific totalitarian outrage, and it took two, three years for everyone to start admitting that, well, at the time,
[03:01:46.781 --> 03:02:05.559]  We read news articles, we saw top environmentalists praising how quiet it was, how nature had returned, how everything was so serene, how maybe we should do this again in the future, only in the name of preventing global warming, a completely made-up hysterical nonsense topic.
[03:02:06.596 --> 03:02:12.198]  Now, at the time, during the lockdowns, we came out and said they're going to start pushing climate lockdowns.
[03:02:12.198 --> 03:02:21.161]  You're not allowed to go outside a certain area, you're not allowed to drive your vehicles in certain areas, because you're harming, you're killing the planet.
[03:02:21.161 --> 03:02:29.464]  Now, at that exact same time, the mainstream media, the regime narrative came out that climate lockdowns were a baseless conspiracy theory.
[03:02:29.464 --> 03:02:31.945]  How dare you even suggest we're planning that?
[03:02:32.654 --> 03:02:43.360]  Of course, on the very same day when news outlets like Sky News came out and claimed that it was all a baseless conspiracy theory, Indian cities were literally telling their people to stay indoors.
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:48.842]  They banned cars in major cities because of pollution, because of the climate.
[03:02:48.842 --> 03:02:52.164]  So it was already happening two years ago.
[03:02:52.164 --> 03:03:01.709]  Now it's about to happen for real, on a sustained basis, in the United Kingdom, in a major city, City of Oxford.
[03:03:02.995 --> 03:03:19.317]  Now, a couple of days ago, What's Up With That, which is a top climate change skeptic website, came out with an article pointing out that the local council, the local authorities in Oxford, had outlined this scheme which they were set to trial, and in fact the trials are already beginning.
[03:03:20.163 --> 03:03:35.570]  To designate residents who live in the city of Oxford individual regions where they're not allowed to drive their private vehicle outside of that region more than a hundred times a year.
[03:03:35.570 --> 03:03:39.032]  You can do it a hundred times a year with government permission.
[03:03:39.032 --> 03:03:41.052]  That of course equates to two times a week.
[03:03:41.052 --> 03:03:46.515]  If you live in a certain area of the city of Oxford and you drive to work five times a week,
[03:03:47.262 --> 03:03:59.405]  To an area of Oxford, which is maybe on the other side of the city, on the outskirts, or even in a different town, you will only be allowed to leave your region twice a week with government permission.
[03:03:59.405 --> 03:04:09.447]  If you're a naughty boy or girl and you do that more than twice a week, you will be hit with onerous fines at the same level as speeding fines, which in the UK it's about £70.
[03:04:12.287 --> 03:04:13.288]  Which is, of course, about $100.
[03:04:13.288 --> 03:04:19.493]  Now, you add that up over the course of the week, that is an onerous level of fines.
[03:04:19.493 --> 03:04:31.743]  The Council came out after this article went viral and tried to fact-check the claims within it, but in doing so, only basically acknowledged and admitted that the entire scheme was taking place.
[03:04:31.743 --> 03:04:33.224]  That is massive!
[03:04:33.224 --> 03:04:37.448]  The first of its kind that we've seen and an indication of what's going to happen in the future
[03:04:37.948 --> 03:04:42.611]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[03:05:05.259 --> 03:05:15.642]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[03:05:15.642 --> 03:05:28.385]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[03:05:29.165 --> 03:05:29.645]  We're good.
[03:06:06.377 --> 03:06:12.422]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:12.422 --> 03:06:26.253]  Now of course the foot soldiers of the Great Reset globalist technocratic agenda have been out on the streets of London for basically now what, the past two months plus?
[03:06:26.253 --> 03:06:31.017]  Blocking traffic, blocking ambulances, causing major accidents in some cases.
[03:06:32.131 --> 03:06:33.952]  Legally, they were stopped from doing that.
[03:06:33.952 --> 03:06:35.413]  They were prevented from doing that.
[03:06:35.413 --> 03:06:41.116]  Now they're doing slow walks through major streets in London on a daily basis.
[03:06:41.116 --> 03:06:43.217]  The public absolutely hates it.
[03:06:43.217 --> 03:06:45.319]  They have an approval rating of about 8%.
[03:06:45.319 --> 03:06:46.439]  They don't care.
[03:06:46.439 --> 03:06:51.602]  They're not trying to convince anyone because they know they have establishment backing.
[03:06:51.602 --> 03:06:56.085]  They're literally funded by Getty Oil billionaire money.
[03:06:56.725 --> 03:07:05.868]  Every major institution, every major transnational corporation, bank, legacy media outlet, academic front supports their agenda.
[03:07:05.868 --> 03:07:14.771]  The government is enacting their agenda every single day with the march, the relentless hysterical march towards net zero.
[03:07:14.771 --> 03:07:20.133]  They're just not doing it quite as fast enough as these eco-warrior groups want them to.
[03:07:21.138 --> 03:07:24.559]  Of course, Just Stop Oil is a rebrand of Extinction Rebellion.
[03:07:24.559 --> 03:07:28.601]  Extinction Rebellion has been around for a fair few years now.
[03:07:28.601 --> 03:07:30.722]  Their stunts garnered them again.
[03:07:30.722 --> 03:07:37.385]  Widespread disdain amongst the public, they became very unpopular, so they merely rebranded themselves.
[03:07:37.385 --> 03:07:43.768]  They were called Insulate Britain last year, now they're back in the guise of Just Stop Oil.
[03:07:43.768 --> 03:07:49.410]  These are the people who are out attacking precious works of art in art galleries with paint,
[03:07:50.089 --> 03:07:53.352]  With substances, ironically, that come from the oil industry.
[03:07:53.352 --> 03:07:54.653]  They're literally made from oil.
[03:07:54.653 --> 03:07:55.834]  They don't care about it.
[03:07:55.834 --> 03:07:57.815]  They're rampant hypocrites.
[03:07:57.815 --> 03:08:01.999]  They're not trying to convince anyone because they don't need to.
[03:08:01.999 --> 03:08:05.541]  They have establishment backing.
[03:08:05.541 --> 03:08:06.042]  Headline!
[03:08:06.042 --> 03:08:08.804]  Just Stop Oil activists admit using petrol cars.
[03:08:08.804 --> 03:08:11.446]  Claim they're not hypocrites.
[03:08:11.446 --> 03:08:13.007]  I'm a vegan.
[03:08:13.007 --> 03:08:15.089]  I eat meat, but I'm not a hypocrite.
[03:08:15.089 --> 03:08:16.130]  Okay then.
[03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:17.931]  That's literally what they're saying now.
[03:08:17.931 --> 03:08:18.572]  This is the level.
[03:08:19.272 --> 03:08:33.736]  Leading activists with climate change protest group Just Stop Oil have admitted that they drive petrol cars, you can't have an annual family holiday though, you're bad, you need to reduce your carbon footprint, but still claim that this doesn't make them hypocrites.
[03:08:33.736 --> 03:08:42.698]  This was a report in the Telegraph where they interviewed Dr. Larch Maxey, another posh professor with plums in his mouth, they're all upper middle class toffs.
[03:08:43.473 --> 03:08:48.035]  Living on mummy and daddy's money, nothing going on in their lives, so what do they need to do?
[03:08:48.035 --> 03:08:51.017]  They need social media clout!
[03:08:51.017 --> 03:09:00.261]  Maxi, a climate scientist from the Eco Group, said some members still drive cars and fill up with petrol, but rejected the idea that it was hypocritical.
[03:09:00.261 --> 03:09:07.565]  Now bear in mind, not only do you have electric cars now, people would say, well they're too expensive, they can't afford them.
[03:09:08.624 --> 03:09:13.427]  The United Kingdom is not like America in the sense that it's a way smaller country.
[03:09:13.427 --> 03:09:27.397]  Obviously, we have a vast public transport network, which despite all the strikes and all the people who work within that public transport network constantly demanding pay raises and striking, is still pretty good.
[03:09:27.397 --> 03:09:32.020]  It covers the entire country, trains, buses, you name it.
[03:09:32.020 --> 03:09:32.720]  It's pretty good.
[03:09:32.720 --> 03:09:34.962]  You can get around fairly easily.
[03:09:34.962 --> 03:09:36.663]  This will sound absolutely alien,
[03:09:37.653 --> 03:09:46.561]  People living in America with their six lanes of traffic where in Austin or any of these major cities, Dallas, you can't walk anywhere.
[03:09:46.561 --> 03:09:51.785]  It's basically a war on the pedestrian, which I don't think they've got the balance right.
[03:09:51.785 --> 03:10:02.513]  So they'd be shocked to learn that yes, indeed, in the United Kingdom, you can basically get anywhere within a reasonable amount of time using buses, using trains.
[03:10:02.513 --> 03:10:05.776]  Of course, it's more convenient to use a car and everyone should have the right to do that.
[03:10:06.474 --> 03:10:09.415]  But you can get out of using a car!
[03:10:09.415 --> 03:10:12.616]  So it's no excuse to say, oh, we can't use a car because we can't get anywhere.
[03:10:12.616 --> 03:10:13.737]  You can!
[03:10:13.737 --> 03:10:30.303]  Every single major city and town in the United Kingdom is festooned with cycle lanes, to the point where they will literally close off entire major roads, which have funneled traffic, important traffic, to different areas of the city, and turn them entirely over to cycle lanes.
[03:10:31.218 --> 03:10:36.922]  They install 20 mile per hour speed limit zones throughout major cities now.
[03:10:36.922 --> 03:10:38.843]  It started in London.
[03:10:38.843 --> 03:10:41.084]  It's actually dangerous to go that slow.
[03:10:41.084 --> 03:10:51.231]  I mean, have you ever been driving and you're stuck behind someone who's incredibly slow doing 20 miles an hour below the speed limit that's supposedly in place for that road?
[03:10:51.231 --> 03:10:53.752]  You literally have to concentrate while you're driving.
[03:10:53.752 --> 03:10:54.433]  It's dangerous.
[03:10:55.419 --> 03:11:00.842]  So everything caters for the eco-mentalist warrior in the United Kingdom in terms of transport.
[03:11:00.842 --> 03:11:03.123]  They've got so many different options.
[03:11:03.123 --> 03:11:04.204]  But no!
[03:11:04.204 --> 03:11:10.707]  These eco-warriors who say, just stop oil, shut down the entire industry now.
[03:11:10.707 --> 03:11:14.929]  Is it too much to ask them to take alternative green forms of transport?
[03:11:14.929 --> 03:11:17.751]  Well, apparently so.
[03:11:17.751 --> 03:11:21.413]  According to activist leaders, they are victims of the fossil fuel economy.
[03:11:22.859 --> 03:11:32.747]  Maxi says people who call for the oil industry to be shut down but then drive petrol cars shouldn't be called out for hypocrisy, because they're just doing our best within that to push for the necessary change.
[03:11:32.747 --> 03:11:46.137]  Again, it's literally like some militant hardcore vegan lecturing you about eating a McDonald's or eating a steak in a fancy restaurant, then going home and talking into a friggin Burger King.
[03:11:46.137 --> 03:11:51.461]  Yes, you can live by your cause without being a massive hypocrite.
[03:11:52.583 --> 03:11:59.648]  And what did we see with Insulate Britain, another offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, of Just Stop Oil, it's all the same people.
[03:11:59.648 --> 03:12:15.458]  The leader of Insulate Britain, and again, the same people were out last year under the banner of this name, blocking the roads, stopping ambulances, causing absolute bedlam, protected by the establishment, as I'll talk about in a minute.
[03:12:15.458 --> 03:12:18.040]  This was the leader of this group.
[03:12:18.962 --> 03:12:24.206]  Who said he didn't even insulate his own home, and doesn't care about insulating homes.
[03:12:24.206 --> 03:12:28.109]  The leader of the group calling for all homes in Britain to be insulated.
[03:12:28.109 --> 03:12:30.111]  Didn't even do it himself.
[03:12:30.111 --> 03:12:34.194]  Rampant hypocrisy, but again it goes beyond hypocrisy.
[03:12:34.194 --> 03:12:40.059]  It's about attention seeking, it's about social media clout, and it's about do as we say, not as we do.
[03:12:42.239 --> 03:12:51.125]  And again, the government, every major cultural institution, transnational corporation, bank, academic institution, legacy media outlet, they're all pushing the same message!
[03:12:51.125 --> 03:13:01.191]  How is that an organic grassroots resistance movement when the entire regime establishment is on the same side of you and is pushing your message?
[03:13:01.191 --> 03:13:08.236]  And not only that, we saw the treatment of anti-lockdown protesters, of anti-vaccine mandate protesters,
[03:13:08.906 --> 03:13:14.890]  Across the world, of course, in Canada, getting their bank accounts frozen, being treated like literal domestic terrorists.
[03:13:14.890 --> 03:13:17.011]  We also saw it in the UK.
[03:13:17.011 --> 03:13:20.513]  I attended several anti-lockdown marches, rallies.
[03:13:20.513 --> 03:13:33.220]  If any anti-lockdown protesters, anti-vaccine mandate protesters, blocked a major road in London for two friggin' minutes, they would send in the riot cops to crack skulls.
[03:13:33.220 --> 03:13:34.581]  I was right in the middle of it.
[03:13:34.581 --> 03:13:38.003]  I got footage of it and posted it on Twitter last summer.
[03:13:39.016 --> 03:13:40.897]  July 2021.
[03:13:40.897 --> 03:13:42.479]  They steamed in.
[03:13:42.479 --> 03:13:46.782]  These hippies were sat in the middle of the road, dancing to Bob Marley music.
[03:13:46.782 --> 03:13:51.546]  Two minutes later, full riot cops steamed in to get them out of the way.
[03:13:51.546 --> 03:13:54.948]  How do they treat just-stop oil protesters?
[03:13:54.948 --> 03:13:57.730]  Well, we've seen how they treat them when they sit in the middle of the road.
[03:13:57.730 --> 03:14:02.994]  They give them cups of tea and cancelling and say, oh, if there's anything you need, just let us know.
[03:14:02.994 --> 03:14:05.636]  And they sit there for hours.
[03:14:05.636 --> 03:14:07.798]  The police do nothing.
[03:14:08.658 --> 03:14:18.000]  The public outcry was so vast that they finally passed a new law, or changed the existing law, to empower the police to shift them if they sit in the middle of the road.
[03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:23.281]  So now they're just slow walking through major cities with traffic backed up behind them anyway.
[03:14:23.281 --> 03:14:26.362]  Basically the same thing.
[03:14:26.362 --> 03:14:28.643]  And they're still getting police protection.
[03:14:28.643 --> 03:14:29.683]  Telegraph reports.
[03:14:30.549 --> 03:14:36.192]  Just stop oil, skip lorry, plough through park to dodge protests and is then stopped by the police.
[03:14:36.192 --> 03:14:40.094]  Anyone who shouts at these upper middle class snobs.
[03:14:40.094 --> 03:14:43.496]  One guy threw an orange at them, didn't hit them.
[03:14:43.496 --> 03:14:45.997]  They're immediately pounced on by the cops.
[03:14:46.647 --> 03:14:49.068]  These people can cause major chaos.
[03:14:49.068 --> 03:14:58.134]  People have literally died, not only from not getting to hospital in time, but through other pile-ups which occur as a result of the traffic building on other roads.
[03:14:58.134 --> 03:15:00.395]  There was a woman who had to be airlifted to hospital.
[03:15:00.395 --> 03:15:01.455]  She didn't make it.
[03:15:01.455 --> 03:15:04.617]  She died because of this group's actions.
[03:15:04.617 --> 03:15:13.102]  Their protest is literally killing people, which is any definition of domestic terrorism in any other language, and they do nothing.
[03:15:14.978 --> 03:15:21.642]  A skip truck driver roared into a park while yelling expletives at police officers as he dodged the Just Stop oil blockade.
[03:15:21.642 --> 03:15:30.046]  He mounted the pavement, sped through the grass and trees of Stoke Newington Common, and careened off the pavement to the other side of the road.
[03:15:30.046 --> 03:15:32.788]  A police car raced after the trucker following the incident.
[03:15:32.788 --> 03:15:37.870]  Again, they're causing mass bedlam and chaos in the capital of England.
[03:15:37.870 --> 03:15:44.274]  This frustrated truck driver tries to take a shortcut through a park to get past them to get in front of them,
[03:15:44.941 --> 03:15:48.843]  He's pounced on like he's the terrorist, like he's the criminal.
[03:15:48.843 --> 03:15:54.747]  The trucker gave the middle finger to police officers walking alongside the protest and yelled, you're just as bad as them.
[03:15:54.747 --> 03:15:55.787]  We'll have more, we'll be back.
[03:15:55.787 --> 03:15:57.088]  Submit not news, don't go.
[03:15:57.088 --> 03:16:04.072]  So, when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[03:16:04.452 --> 03:16:05.073]  We're good to go.
[03:16:20.333 --> 03:16:25.697]  Two weeks I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[03:16:25.697 --> 03:16:27.159]  You know, I could think again.
[03:16:27.159 --> 03:16:29.000]  I could connect with people again.
[03:16:29.000 --> 03:16:35.366]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements.
[03:16:35.366 --> 03:16:37.828]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[03:16:37.828 --> 03:16:39.649]  One I like recently is Knockout.
[03:16:39.649 --> 03:16:41.891]  It'll literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[03:16:41.891 --> 03:16:42.612]  It's amazing.
[03:16:42.612 --> 03:16:42.932]  It works.
[03:16:43.112 --> 03:16:45.676]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[03:16:45.676 --> 03:16:48.180]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[03:16:48.180 --> 03:16:51.866]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[03:16:51.866 --> 03:16:53.128]  Beautifully said, brother.
[03:16:53.128 --> 03:16:55.091]  I thank you so much for your call and Godspeed.
[03:16:57.307 --> 03:17:04.290]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:17:04.290 --> 03:17:09.472]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[03:17:09.472 --> 03:17:16.515]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[03:17:16.515 --> 03:17:19.697]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[03:17:20.577 --> 03:17:24.739]  And you can do that now at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:17:24.739 --> 03:17:31.181]  Help us clear out our stock of body's turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[03:17:31.181 --> 03:17:38.604]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[03:17:38.604 --> 03:17:41.825]  Now, with free shipping.
[03:17:41.825 --> 03:17:48.087]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[03:17:56.661 --> 03:18:17.274]  The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible,
[03:18:17.814 --> 03:18:30.905]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[03:18:30.905 --> 03:18:45.998]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[03:18:46.038 --> 03:18:47.720]  So continue to do it.
[03:18:47.720 --> 03:18:49.902]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:49.902 --> 03:18:52.004]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.
[03:18:52.004 --> 03:18:56.950]  Continue to keep InfoWars alive because in the process you're keeping American liberty alive.
[03:18:57.930 --> 03:19:00.152]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:19:00.152 --> 03:19:04.176]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:19:04.176 --> 03:19:05.497]  There's a solution.
[03:19:05.497 --> 03:19:06.498]  The Wellness Company.
[03:19:06.498 --> 03:19:09.801]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:19:09.801 --> 03:19:17.007]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:19:17.247 --> 03:19:43.313]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:19:44.409 --> 03:19:44.910]  I think so.
[03:20:12.719 --> 03:20:25.123]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:25.123 --> 03:20:33.645]  So this Just Stop Oil Eco Warrior Establishment funded group, literally funded by billionaires, continues to cause chaos across London.
[03:20:34.603 --> 03:20:38.845]  One van driver, as I explained before the break, got frustrated and tried to get ahead of them.
[03:20:38.845 --> 03:20:43.447]  He was immediately pounced on by the police because he's the bigger threat, obviously.
[03:20:43.447 --> 03:20:47.790]  There was another guy who threw an orange at the eco group.
[03:20:47.790 --> 03:20:52.952]  Again, the headline is, Just Stop Oil Police Tell Furious Pedestrian Who Threw Orange.
[03:20:52.952 --> 03:20:54.533]  So, basically leave them alone.
[03:20:55.393 --> 03:20:58.574]  Says it prompted four police officers to rush over him.
[03:20:58.574 --> 03:21:08.777]  Bear in mind, these police officers are marching side by side as if they're part of the movement with Just Stop Oil in the streets.
[03:21:08.777 --> 03:21:12.639]  Just the sight of that makes the public angry and frustrated, as you can tell.
[03:21:12.639 --> 03:21:15.800]  They're not trying to stop them do anything.
[03:21:15.800 --> 03:21:19.781]  So four police officers rushed over, quick!
[03:21:19.781 --> 03:21:22.602]  Because he threw an orange at them, which didn't even hit anyone.
[03:21:23.473 --> 03:21:26.814]  And told him to, quote, leave them to it.
[03:21:26.814 --> 03:21:32.415]  An officer told the pedestrian, they're minding their own business, what harm are they doing to you?
[03:21:32.415 --> 03:21:34.816]  They're literally siding with them.
[03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:38.937]  None of this nonsense about, oh, we want to arrest them, we just can't.
[03:21:38.937 --> 03:21:42.338]  A lot of these cops are basically eco-warriors as well.
[03:21:42.338 --> 03:21:43.919]  You've seen what they do elsewhere.
[03:21:43.919 --> 03:21:49.340]  They literally go out and arrest people for posting mean things about transgenders on Facebook.
[03:21:50.387 --> 03:21:54.709]  Another officer said, this is your final warning or you'll get nicked.
[03:21:54.709 --> 03:22:05.854]  Again, some of these same cops literally dance in the streets with these eco-warrior criminals as they do at the gay pride parades.
[03:22:05.854 --> 03:22:07.014]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:22:07.014 --> 03:22:10.176]  Then listen to this.
[03:22:10.176 --> 03:22:15.458]  There's another quote in this article which I couldn't believe.
[03:22:15.458 --> 03:22:15.958]  Here it is.
[03:22:15.958 --> 03:22:19.740]  It says, during Thursday morning's protest,
[03:22:20.592 --> 03:22:28.318]  A Met Police officer asks Sean Irish, the Just Stop Oil health and safety officer, leading the protest.
[03:22:28.318 --> 03:22:31.541]  This is what the cop said to the protest leader.
[03:22:31.541 --> 03:22:38.146]  Do you know how long you're going to be in the road for, sir?
[03:22:38.146 --> 03:22:41.849]  They would never say that to anti-vaccine mandate protesters.
[03:22:41.849 --> 03:22:47.934]  They're the most confrontational, aggressive individuals when it comes to those kind of protests.
[03:22:47.934 --> 03:22:49.896]  Some protesters are better than others, I guess.
[03:22:51.351 --> 03:23:02.775]  This is the Met Police Officer literally asking the leader of the group that's committing crimes, Do you know how long you're going to be in the road for, sir?
[03:23:02.775 --> 03:23:05.416]  They're commanding the police!
[03:23:05.416 --> 03:23:10.598]  The police aren't even telling them what to do, they're telling the police what to do.
[03:23:10.598 --> 03:23:19.962]  When Mr Irish responded that he did not know, the police officer replied, Is there anything I could ask you that you might want to tell us just to help us manage the rest of London?
[03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:23.636]  What the hell?
[03:23:23.636 --> 03:23:25.456]  That is incredible.
[03:23:25.456 --> 03:23:31.357]  Is there anything I could ask you that you might want to tell us?
[03:23:31.357 --> 03:23:32.098]  Oh my God.
[03:23:32.098 --> 03:23:44.080]  A pedestrian waiting for a bus later took his anger out on the strolling officers walking alongside the blockade shouting, Why are eight police officers walking alongside them for F sake?
[03:23:44.080 --> 03:23:45.921]  Oh God.
[03:23:45.921 --> 03:23:47.121]  Just for optics.
[03:23:48.155 --> 03:23:59.197]  At least act like you're somewhat adversarial towards these eco-warriors who are stopping ordinary working people from getting to work.
[03:23:59.197 --> 03:24:01.278]  They're blocking ambulances.
[03:24:01.278 --> 03:24:04.778]  I put footage of that in my video.
[03:24:04.778 --> 03:24:06.479]  They're literally blocking ambulances.
[03:24:06.479 --> 03:24:09.819]  They're causing accidents which are killing people.
[03:24:09.819 --> 03:24:13.020]  And the police are going up to them and saying, is there anything that you need?
[03:24:13.020 --> 03:24:14.360]  Can we help you in any way?
[03:24:14.360 --> 03:24:15.701]  It's pathetic.
[03:24:15.701 --> 03:24:17.141]  That's why people are angry.
[03:24:18.337 --> 03:24:23.879]  It's not really the protesters, it's the way that they're treated by the police.
[03:24:23.879 --> 03:24:25.620]  Same with BLM.
[03:24:25.620 --> 03:24:28.341]  Literally, they might as well start kneeling before them.
[03:24:28.341 --> 03:24:31.662]  Why don't you start doing that?
[03:24:31.662 --> 03:24:34.844]  And this is the absolute foundation of all this.
[03:24:34.844 --> 03:24:43.507]  They're pushing hysterical nonsense, which is harming people's lives, which is causing fuel poverty, which is killing people.
[03:24:43.507 --> 03:24:45.308]  We've got warnings this week in the UK.
[03:24:46.599 --> 03:24:48.421]  about low temperatures.
[03:24:48.421 --> 03:24:54.285]  It's down to about minus one degrees outside as I make this program where I live.
[03:24:54.285 --> 03:25:01.751]  They're telling pensioners you have to keep your heating at 18 degrees Celsius or you may get ill and die.
[03:25:01.751 --> 03:25:14.261]  Many people can't do that because they can't afford to pay the heating bill because of the same green levies that these protesters are pushing that the government isn't acting.
[03:25:14.261 --> 03:25:15.562]  So yeah, people are going to die.
[03:25:16.195 --> 03:25:22.420]  There was a guy who posted his heating bill on Twitter yesterday, and I've put this in one of the videos today.
[03:25:22.420 --> 03:25:25.702]  His heating bill is £1,000 plus a month.
[03:25:25.702 --> 03:25:30.206]  That's about $1,300 per month.
[03:25:30.206 --> 03:25:33.628]  That's like a mortgage for most people.
[03:25:33.628 --> 03:25:37.711]  That's more than a lot of people earn in a month, just the heating bill alone.
[03:25:37.711 --> 03:25:42.195]  Because of the current thing, keep waving your Ukraine flag, and because of these green levies,
[03:25:42.955 --> 03:25:49.277]  That incentivise useless wind turbines that can't cover the energy demands of the population.
[03:25:49.277 --> 03:25:53.298]  And that's only getting worse.
[03:25:53.298 --> 03:26:03.642]  So they're literally pushing that paradigm where people, old people, OIPs can't afford to put the heating on because of these green levies and they're literally going to die in their own homes.
[03:26:04.338 --> 03:26:14.664]  And these people claim to have the moral high ground when they're supported by every branch of the establishment and literally protected by the police on a daily basis.
[03:26:14.664 --> 03:26:18.667]  UK City defends new climate lockdown policy.
[03:26:18.667 --> 03:26:23.870]  Again, we're not going to have time to play the video now, but I talked about it in the opening segment.
[03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:33.496]  The City of Oxford has embraced the concept of limiting citizens' personal travel to fight climate change, an idea once dismissed as a conspiracy theory.
[03:26:33.496 --> 03:26:33.816]  And again,
[03:26:34.609 --> 03:26:53.659]  I did an article during lockdown where the Indian government came out in Delhi and these other cities and said you're not allowed to drive your car in these certain cities over the course of the next week because there's too much pollution, there's too much traffic congestion and it's bad for the planet.
[03:26:53.659 --> 03:26:58.182]  It was a de facto climate lockdown but because they didn't call it a climate lockdown
[03:26:58.931 --> 03:27:06.137]  Then anyone that claimed it was a climate lockdown was a dangerous conspiracy theorist pushing misinformation.
[03:27:06.137 --> 03:27:24.171]  And of course at the time on Twitter, maybe not so much now, but definitely on Facebook, those claims of a climate lockdown were buried in the algorithm because it was deemed a conspiracy theory by the fact-checkers working for legacy media outlets, which is basically the same thing.
[03:27:24.171 --> 03:27:28.495]  They're all the same people and yet they claim to be an independent body outside of the mainstream media.
[03:27:29.480 --> 03:27:35.781]  And they said that's a conspiracy theory, it's not happening on the very day that India was doing it.
[03:27:35.781 --> 03:27:40.803]  Well now they're rolling it out across the United Kingdom in some of these major cities.
[03:27:40.803 --> 03:27:44.523]  You know, I went back to Sheffield, my home city, a couple of months ago.
[03:27:44.523 --> 03:27:48.984]  They're introducing all the 20 mile per hour roads.
[03:27:48.984 --> 03:27:52.445]  Sheffield's not even really a busy city compared to London.
[03:27:52.445 --> 03:27:55.866]  But everywhere is a war on personal choice.
[03:27:56.869 --> 03:28:01.851]  A war on living standards, a war on basically being able to get out anywhere.
[03:28:01.851 --> 03:28:13.915]  Now in Oxford they're telling people, we will give you permits from the central government local authorities, 100 permits a year, where you're allowed to go outside your little region of Oxford.
[03:28:13.915 --> 03:28:17.516]  Oxford's not even a huge city!
[03:28:17.516 --> 03:28:21.518]  Where you're not allowed to go outside of your little region more than a hundred times a year.
[03:28:21.518 --> 03:28:25.599]  If you do so, you'll get fined, because we have traffic congestion.
[03:28:26.403 --> 03:28:30.704]  There's literally been massive protest at City Hall in response to this.
[03:28:30.704 --> 03:28:32.164]  It slipped out in the media.
[03:28:32.164 --> 03:28:34.905]  It's now becoming a major nationwide issue.
[03:28:34.905 --> 03:28:39.866]  And the local council has come out basically and said, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:39.866 --> 03:28:48.808]  We're going to fact check this by pointing out that some of the details about how the scheme is implemented were slightly exaggerated or inaccurate.
[03:28:48.808 --> 03:28:50.869]  And so the whole thing's a conspiracy theory.
[03:28:51.522 --> 03:28:53.384]  This is the fact checker industrial complex.
[03:28:53.384 --> 03:28:54.485]  That's what they do every time.
[03:28:54.485 --> 03:28:55.687]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[03:28:55.687 --> 03:28:57.448]  Summit.News, don't go.
[03:28:57.448 --> 03:29:07.760]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[03:29:08.300 --> 03:29:12.761]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:29:12.761 --> 03:29:17.082]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:29:17.082 --> 03:29:21.163]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:29:21.163 --> 03:29:27.204]  You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[03:29:27.204 --> 03:29:31.085]  But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[03:29:31.085 --> 03:29:35.346]  And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:29:35.846 --> 03:29:40.591]  So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high-quality vitamin D3.
[03:29:40.591 --> 03:29:50.640]  And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body for 50% off at InfoWarStore.com with promo code 1776.

[03:29:56.773 --> 03:30:08.086]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:30:08.086 --> 03:30:09.988]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:30:09.988 --> 03:30:11.450]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:12.952]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:30:12.952 --> 03:30:14.694]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:30:14.694 --> 03:30:15.955]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:30:15.955 --> 03:30:17.337]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:30:17.757 --> 03:30:22.602]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:30:22.602 --> 03:30:24.984]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:30:24.984 --> 03:30:27.006]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:30:27.006 --> 03:30:33.953]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:30:34.594 --> 03:30:39.976]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[03:30:39.976 --> 03:30:48.919]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.

[03:30:56.601 --> 03:31:02.583]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you the Wellness Company.

[03:32:16.991 --> 03:32:17.451]  We're good.
[03:32:36.505 --> 03:32:39.986]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:22.506 --> 03:33:30.948]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:33:30.948 --> 03:33:42.450]  I've waffled on about it enough now, so let's just go to the video and then I'll come back and talk about Harry and Meghan and their new Netflix special.
[03:33:42.450 --> 03:33:46.651]  But first, let's go to this video about the climate lockdowns.
[03:33:46.651 --> 03:33:48.912]  This is called It's Real.
[03:33:48.912 --> 03:33:49.512]  Let's roll it.
[03:33:50.430 --> 03:33:53.472]  Update to the climate lockdown video from earlier this week.
[03:33:53.472 --> 03:34:18.387]  In case you missed it, local authorities in Oxford, England are trialling a scheme set to be launched in 2024 that would see residents restricted to travelling by car outside their designated regional zone within the city, being forced to register their vehicle and get permission passes from the government, which would then only allow them to travel outside of their designated regional zone twice a week and be hit with onerous fines if they violate that.
[03:34:18.407 --> 03:34:27.399]  Which means if you work in a different part of the city and have to travel there five times a week, if you make that journey by private car, they're gonna fine you three times a week, every week!
[03:34:27.399 --> 03:34:33.748]  Well now the council has come out and tried to fact-check the whole thing as if it isn't happening, while simultaneously admitting...
[03:34:34.389 --> 03:34:35.230]  That it's all happening.
[03:34:35.230 --> 03:34:36.711]  The Oxfordshire Mail reports...
[03:34:51.380 --> 03:34:51.540]  Really?
[03:34:51.540 --> 03:34:51.720]  Right!
[03:35:17.461 --> 03:35:18.562]  So it is happening.
[03:35:18.562 --> 03:35:26.005]  Contrary to the viral article's claims, there will be no physical barriers with the restricted zones monitored by automatic number plate recognition cameras.
[03:35:26.005 --> 03:35:26.765]  Oh, don't worry.
[03:35:26.765 --> 03:35:28.706]  There'll be no physical barriers.
[03:35:28.706 --> 03:35:33.568]  Your car will be tracked and traced for infractions via a network of surveillance cameras.
[03:35:33.568 --> 03:35:35.069]  So I guess it's okay then.
[03:35:35.069 --> 03:35:41.992]  Up to 100 day passes per year will be offered to residents of businesses affected by the changes, enabling them to travel through the filters without penalty.
[03:35:41.992 --> 03:35:42.753]  Right, so again...
[03:35:43.513 --> 03:35:44.613]  It is still happening.
[03:35:44.613 --> 03:35:51.535]  Everywhere in the city will still be accessible by car, although some private car drivers may need to use a different route during the operating hours of the traffic filters.
[03:35:51.535 --> 03:35:56.337]  When they are operating, private cars will not be allowed through without a permit.
[03:35:56.337 --> 03:35:57.817]  Right, so it's still happening.
[03:35:57.817 --> 03:36:05.040]  Just because you call it a traffic congestion reduction scheme and not a climate lockdown doesn't mean it's not happening.
[03:36:05.040 --> 03:36:05.640]  It is.
[03:36:05.640 --> 03:36:06.080]  So yes.
[03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:07.260]  It's all true.
[03:36:07.260 --> 03:36:14.082]  If you exceed your government travel ration, every time you dare leave your allocator regional zone, they'll fine you.
[03:36:14.082 --> 03:36:24.925]  I love how they imply that the coverage of this is fake news or inaccurate, by contesting a couple of details about how the scheme will be implemented, but then basically acknowledge that it's all going to be implemented anyway.
[03:36:24.925 --> 03:36:33.927]  Meanwhile, thanks in part to the current thing and the move towards net zero, which is going to make energy even more expensive for people already struggling through a cost of living crisis,
[03:36:34.087 --> 03:36:45.174]  For some people, it's cheaper to stay in a holiday home in Spain, where temperatures are still around 20 degrees Celsius, as part of a package deal, than it is to heat your home in Britain.
[03:36:45.174 --> 03:36:52.699]  This poor guy's paying over a thousand pounds a month simply to stay warm, when he could be sunning himself on the Costa Brava for less money.
[03:36:52.699 --> 03:37:01.185]  And if these climate hysteria clowns get their way, not only will you be put under climate lockdown, but your energy bills are just gonna get higher and higher.
[03:37:03.900 --> 03:37:23.945]  Now, sticking with the subject of climate change hysteria, in the same week that Meghan and Harry launched the latest installment of their victimhood pity party, race-baiting crap, climate change activists Harry and Meghan take private jet to pick up Anti-Racism Award in New York.
[03:37:23.945 --> 03:37:28.026]  The second private jet trip in the space of one week.
[03:37:28.026 --> 03:37:29.126]  Wait until you find out.
[03:37:30.249 --> 03:37:38.135]  After what event they took the other private jet trip, this video is called, What Have They Done Now?
[03:37:38.135 --> 03:37:38.756]  Let's roll it.
[03:37:39.864 --> 03:37:42.267]  It's everyone's favourite idiotic insufferable couple.
[03:37:42.267 --> 03:37:43.708]  What have they done now?
[03:37:43.708 --> 03:37:57.103]  Harry and Meghan have been praised as heroic and given an anti-racism award by other elitists, so they're friends basically, for their incredibly brave stance against the structural racism of the royal family.
[03:37:57.103 --> 03:37:59.586]  That stance ostensibly comprising of claiming
[03:38:00.106 --> 03:38:07.051]  With no evidence whatsoever that certain members of the Royal Family speculated on what skin colour Harry and Meghan's newborn baby would be.
[03:38:07.051 --> 03:38:11.374]  Something that multiple media publications engaged in months before the baby was born.
[03:38:11.374 --> 03:38:16.938]  And guess how Harry and Meghan, sanctimonious climate change activists, extraordinaire...
[03:38:17.458 --> 03:38:19.038]  ...arrived at this event in New York.
[03:38:19.038 --> 03:38:21.859]  Via their luxury private jet, of course.
[03:38:21.859 --> 03:38:26.800]  The second time in the space of one week that the pair have used such transport.
[03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:31.280]  The first private jet trip was to pick up an environmental award.
[03:38:31.280 --> 03:38:37.402]  Maybe they're trying to beat their previous record of taking four private jet trips in the space of just 11 days.
[03:38:37.402 --> 03:38:42.943]  Remember, this is the guy who gets up in front of the UN and claims that the planet is literally burning up.
[03:38:42.943 --> 03:38:44.663]  Our world is on fire.
[03:38:44.663 --> 03:38:44.863]  Again.
[03:38:45.763 --> 03:38:47.484]  And this crisis will only grow worse.
[03:38:47.484 --> 03:38:57.471]  According to The Independent, last year the company's non-profit Archwell issued a net zero plan which said the organization is committed to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
[03:38:57.471 --> 03:39:08.539]  Presumably, net zero carbon emissions doesn't include the untold tons of carbon emissions being belched out by their private jet, which they continue to use on a regular basis as part of their opulent lifestyle.
[03:39:08.539 --> 03:39:10.800]  But as ever, it's okay when they do it.
[03:39:12.995 --> 03:39:20.101]  If you're so worried about global warming and carbon emissions, accept the bloody award remotely via a Zoom call!
[03:39:20.101 --> 03:39:26.846]  Then they could even use that to draw attention to the cause, like, oh, we didn't turn up in person because we wanted to reduce our carbon footprint.
[03:39:26.846 --> 03:39:28.768]  No, they can't do that, can they?
[03:39:28.768 --> 03:39:30.770]  Because they're shameless grifters!
[03:39:30.770 --> 03:39:40.958]  Any opportunity to engage in more attention-seeking, any chance to have other regime loyalists acknowledge them as really good people, and their egos can't resist.
[03:39:41.238 --> 03:39:45.220]  Suddenly, carbon emissions and saving the planet very much takes a back seat.
[03:39:45.220 --> 03:39:53.745]  Last night, someone yelled at Harry and Meghan that they were destroying the royal family.
[03:39:53.745 --> 03:39:55.366]  Forget destroying the royal family.
[03:39:55.366 --> 03:40:04.832]  If they believe carbon emissions are destroying the planet, then they're destroying the planet, while lecturing you about your carbon footprint for taking an annual family holiday.
[03:40:04.832 --> 03:40:05.172]  Our world
[03:40:05.532 --> 03:40:13.578]  And if you want more Harry and Meghan cringe, check out the video I did on the main channel, which is posted in the pinned comment.
[03:40:13.578 --> 03:40:22.745]  Now, on the subject of shameless grifters, of course, today we've had the release of the first three episodes of Harry and Meghan's new Netflix docuseries.
[03:40:22.745 --> 03:40:30.992]  Yes, this is the same couple that demanded everyone respect their privacy, said their privacy was being invaded by the press, by the general public.
[03:40:31.744 --> 03:40:40.926]  Well, now they've literally done a six-hour special with Netflix, which is slowly being released, claiming that they're harassed.
[03:40:40.926 --> 03:40:42.547]  Again, this is Prince Harry, right?
[03:40:42.547 --> 03:40:52.249]  He got up in front of the UN the same time he did that The World Is On Fire speech, and said that dangerous disinformation was a threat to democracy.
[03:40:52.249 --> 03:40:55.710]  In the first 30 seconds of the trailer for this new Netflix show,
[03:40:56.573 --> 03:41:00.894]  They have about four, five different examples of disinformation.
[03:41:00.894 --> 03:41:04.995]  Their entire narrative is that they're constantly harassed by the press.
[03:41:04.995 --> 03:41:11.236]  And yet in every single instance where they show them allegedly being harassed by the press, it's not even them!
[03:41:11.236 --> 03:41:15.697]  It's British celebrity Katie Price being photographed by the press.
[03:41:15.697 --> 03:41:22.198]  It's a ten-year-old picture from a Harry Potter premiere in London with journalists taking photos.
[03:41:23.024 --> 03:41:33.716]  It's journalists taking photos of Kate Middleton, Prince William's wife, or it's them being photographed by the press in America, not in the United Kingdom.
[03:41:34.384 --> 03:41:56.150]  Literally four separate brazen examples of manipulative, misleading misinformation in their own trailer to this Netflix special, which of course is an addendum to their pity party, self-aggrandizing victimhood narrative that they've been pushing in this country for the past, what, three, four years plus now.
[03:41:56.150 --> 03:42:02.912]  Breitbart reports Harry and Meghan feature prof who said Queen wanted to be white supremacy figurehead in Netflix docs.
[03:42:03.579 --> 03:42:08.962]  Again, this is the same Queen that Harry and Meghan themselves have praised on numerous occasions.
[03:42:08.962 --> 03:42:15.446]  This is the same Queen that oversaw a royal wedding attended by thousands of their adoring fans.
[03:42:15.446 --> 03:42:28.273]  And they released it on the day, three months to the day after the Queen died, and they've got these extremist left-wing woke professors in there claiming that the Queen is the figurehead of white supremacy.
[03:42:29.031 --> 03:42:36.315]  Talking about Queen Elizabeth I, what, 400 friggin' years ago, overseeing slavery.
[03:42:36.315 --> 03:42:39.697]  British people were the first in the world to end slavery.
[03:42:39.697 --> 03:42:44.840]  My ancestors literally risked their lives to go to Africa to end slavery.
[03:42:44.840 --> 03:42:46.121]  We abolished it.
[03:42:46.121 --> 03:42:49.002]  Slavery still exists across the world right now.
[03:42:49.002 --> 03:42:54.305]  Tell you where it does exist now, in non-white countries, but no, apparently, they're to blame.
[03:42:54.305 --> 03:42:55.246]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[03:42:58.953 --> 03:43:03.277]  Because you want it, here's another one just for you.
[03:43:03.277 --> 03:43:08.842]  Because without you, it would truly be a blue Christmas.
[03:43:08.842 --> 03:43:11.344]  But thank God that we have you.
[03:43:11.344 --> 03:43:17.789]  All of us, awakening and vibrant souls all over the Earth.
[03:43:17.789 --> 03:43:22.473]  It's your love, our love, that makes all of this possible.
[03:43:23.448 --> 03:43:33.493]  And if you feel like showing us some love today and help keep us on the air, you can do so at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:43:56.457 --> 03:43:59.801]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[03:43:59.801 --> 03:44:02.624]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[03:44:02.624 --> 03:44:05.348]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[03:44:05.348 --> 03:44:06.629]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:44:06.629 --> 03:44:10.554]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[03:44:10.554 --> 03:44:15.440]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[03:44:15.740 --> 03:44:21.904]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[03:44:21.904 --> 03:44:30.530]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:44:30.530 --> 03:44:36.233]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[03:44:36.233 --> 03:44:41.637]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[03:44:41.877 --> 03:44:44.361]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:44:44.361 --> 03:44:47.046]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[03:44:47.046 --> 03:44:48.548]  So go check out the store.
[03:44:48.548 --> 03:44:49.730]  Go support their store.

[03:44:56.687 --> 03:45:05.530]  December 2022 is here and we are proud and very excited to announce that free shipping is back at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:45:05.530 --> 03:45:09.351]  That's right, free shipping on all orders of $50 or more.

[03:45:24.677 --> 03:45:26.139]  This is a game changer.

[03:45:27.660 --> 03:45:29.922]  Our listeners have really asked for free shipping again.
[03:45:29.922 --> 03:45:34.366]  We couldn't afford it before, but by moving to a bigger national distributor, we're able to do it.
[03:45:34.366 --> 03:45:37.489]  So now, your orders will be shipped even faster.

[03:45:56.901 --> 03:45:59.121]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:45:59.121 --> 03:46:03.142]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[03:46:03.142 --> 03:46:04.463]  There's a solution.
[03:46:04.463 --> 03:46:05.443]  The Wellness Company.
[03:46:05.443 --> 03:46:08.744]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:46:08.744 --> 03:46:15.946]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:46:16.206 --> 03:46:42.282]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:46:43.366 --> 03:46:43.866]  I think so.
[03:47:09.719 --> 03:47:19.446]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:19.446 --> 03:47:23.650]  So this Meghan Markle character is the phoniest person I've ever witnessed.
[03:47:23.650 --> 03:47:24.991]  She's a pure actress.
[03:47:24.991 --> 03:47:27.392]  She's acting all the time.
[03:47:27.392 --> 03:47:30.135]  She's crying in the Netflix trailer.
[03:47:30.135 --> 03:47:34.558]  I mean, you should go and see the clip about... She talks about meeting the Queen, right?
[03:47:35.302 --> 03:47:43.425]  Not expecting to meet the Queen, and then when Prince Harry, her husband, tells her that she's gonna have to curtsy when she meets the Queen.
[03:47:43.425 --> 03:47:44.746]  Now, obviously, I get it.
[03:47:44.746 --> 03:47:46.327]  Curtsying is stupid.
[03:47:46.327 --> 03:47:47.127]  It's ridiculous.
[03:47:47.127 --> 03:47:54.030]  But she claimed she didn't know she had to do that, and she thought it was a joke, that it didn't even exist.
[03:47:54.030 --> 03:48:00.793]  How stupid do you have to be to not know that when you meet the Queen as a woman, you curtsy?
[03:48:00.793 --> 03:48:04.234]  Yeah, I think it's silly, but that's just the tradition, isn't it?
[03:48:04.864 --> 03:48:06.645]  She didn't even know it existed!
[03:48:06.645 --> 03:48:09.086]  She thought it was a joke!
[03:48:09.086 --> 03:48:13.468]  And so she does this overly dramatic curtsy, and you'll see it in the clip.
[03:48:13.468 --> 03:48:16.049]  I've tweeted about it if you want to go and see it.
[03:48:16.049 --> 03:48:21.311]  And it's the most obnoxious, self-righteous crap that you can imagine.
[03:48:21.311 --> 03:48:30.215]  Where she's overly, dramatically doing this massive curtsy as if she's in a, you know, Game of Thrones episode or whatever.
[03:48:30.215 --> 03:48:31.436]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:48:32.140 --> 03:48:36.686]  Narcissistic, egomaniacal scumbags.
[03:48:36.686 --> 03:48:39.049]  Who left the royal family of their own accord.
[03:48:39.716 --> 03:48:46.703]  But then constantly attack the Royal Family at every available opportunity because it defines their entire existence.
[03:48:46.703 --> 03:49:02.579]  Because they're given a hundred million dollars by Netflix for this docu-series which contains intimate details, photographs, videos of their private life, while simultaneously they're constantly whinging about people invading their privacy.
[03:49:03.416 --> 03:49:13.105]  They're talking about intimate details of Prince William and Kate Middleton's relationship in this docuseries while whining about their privacy being invaded.
[03:49:14.048 --> 03:49:26.914]  And then claiming that the Queen is the head of white supremacy and trotting out these far-left extremist woke academics to blame Britain for slavery when we were the first country to end it.
[03:49:26.914 --> 03:49:30.595]  When Brits risked their lives to go abroad to end it.
[03:49:30.595 --> 03:49:34.537]  It still exists in non-white countries to this day.
[03:49:34.537 --> 03:49:38.799]  They've got nothing whatsoever to say about that.
[03:49:38.799 --> 03:49:40.500]  The woke academic, this is Breitbart,
[03:49:41.610 --> 03:50:01.262]  The woke academics' appearances in the series so far have been brief compared to that of the much more heavily featured Afua Hirsch, who previously called for Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square to be toppled, and David Olusoga, who appeared in court to help justify a mob destroying a historic statue during the Black Lives Matter unrest.
[03:50:01.262 --> 03:50:08.347]  So they've literally got these demented far-left academics who want to hate, want to destroy Britain because they hate it,
[03:50:09.105 --> 03:50:14.328]  Talking smack about the Royal Family, because like it or not, it's a British institution.
[03:50:14.328 --> 03:50:16.030]  They want to bring it down.
[03:50:16.030 --> 03:50:19.672]  While saying, oh don't invade our privacy, just leave us alone.
[03:50:19.672 --> 03:50:28.538]  We'll get, we'll take a hundred million dollars from Netflix to literally have them play our intimate relationship diaries.
[03:50:28.538 --> 03:50:31.900]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:50:31.900 --> 03:50:33.281]  Breitbart also reports
[03:50:34.355 --> 03:50:36.116]  Palace hits back at Harry and Meghan.
[03:50:36.116 --> 03:50:38.678]  Netflix claims say they weren't asked to participate.
[03:50:38.678 --> 03:50:39.779]  So it's this common thing.
[03:50:39.779 --> 03:50:42.601]  It's like that when the media does a hit piece against you.
[03:50:42.601 --> 03:50:44.343]  Against someone on the right.
[03:50:44.343 --> 03:50:47.765]  And they say, oh, we reached out for comment, but they never responded.
[03:50:47.765 --> 03:50:49.967]  And they actually never reached out for comment.
[03:50:49.967 --> 03:50:54.650]  Or they reached out for comment two minutes before they published the article.
[03:50:54.650 --> 03:50:57.572]  Daily Mail cites a Buckingham Palace source.
[03:50:57.572 --> 03:51:03.637]  Basically, they said, this weird third-party company reached out and they didn't even know that it was legitimate.
[03:51:04.261 --> 03:51:08.825]  The Royal Family asked Netflix directly, is this legit?
[03:51:08.825 --> 03:51:11.087]  Are they representing who they say they represent?
[03:51:11.087 --> 03:51:14.410]  Netflix didn't respond, so the Royal Family didn't respond.
[03:51:14.410 --> 03:51:23.218]  And then they get to say, oh we told them about all these claims, but they didn't respond, implying that they have no response, when in fact they weren't even properly asked.
[03:51:23.218 --> 03:51:26.401]  It's absolutely incredible.
[03:51:26.401 --> 03:51:28.503]  Let's get to these final two videos now though, because
[03:51:29.204 --> 03:51:31.587]  Breitbart also reports CNN catastrophe.
[03:51:31.587 --> 03:51:33.470]  Viewership plummets to below 500,000.
[03:51:33.470 --> 03:51:41.060]  Ball F.CNN's total day viewership averaged dip below 500,000 during the week of November 28th.
[03:51:41.060 --> 03:51:43.403]  And this is why I make the point over and over again.
[03:51:43.403 --> 03:51:45.005]  The propaganda now...
[03:51:45.865 --> 03:51:58.696]  increasingly is not in current affairs shows, it's not in news broadcasts, it's in fictional TV shows, and especially it's in advertising, which brings us to our next video.
[03:51:58.696 --> 03:52:01.098]  This is called Cringe Washing.
[03:52:01.098 --> 03:52:01.719]  Let's roll it.
[03:52:02.645 --> 03:52:05.987]  I've found another brazen example of THE MESSAGE!
[03:52:05.987 --> 03:52:13.873]  Some of you may have seen the video on my main channel about social engineering woven into virtually every major Christmas TV commercial in the UK.
[03:52:13.873 --> 03:52:15.254]  Well, here's one that I missed!
[03:52:15.254 --> 03:52:19.998]  It's a particularly odious entry from UK retailer Not On The High Street.
[03:52:22.540 --> 03:52:25.321]  This is the only six-pack you should be working on.
[03:52:25.321 --> 03:52:26.021]  Merry Christmas!
[03:52:26.021 --> 03:52:28.261]  Don't exercise, don't bother staying healthy.
[03:52:28.261 --> 03:52:34.563]  Issue self-discipline, embrace instant gratification, and just spend the whole time getting drunk.
[03:52:34.563 --> 03:52:37.723]  OMG, what a year!
[03:52:37.723 --> 03:52:39.464]  Social media addiction is cool.
[03:52:39.464 --> 03:52:41.744]  Sod spending time with your family at Christmas.
[03:52:41.744 --> 03:52:44.625]  Just spend even more time on your phone.
[03:52:44.625 --> 03:52:47.786]  Sorry you have to share your special day with Jesus.
[03:52:47.786 --> 03:52:48.906]  Happy birthday!
[03:52:50.876 --> 03:52:52.197]  Bit of casual blasphemy.
[03:52:52.197 --> 03:52:56.321]  Sorry, your narcissistic moment has to be interrupted by Jesus.
[03:52:56.321 --> 03:52:58.623]  Here, eat some cake and get fat.
[03:52:58.623 --> 03:53:01.446]  Coming from me to complete your Christmas party look.
[03:53:01.446 --> 03:53:02.126]  Stunning.
[03:53:02.126 --> 03:53:05.730]  Celebrate Christmas with gift ideas for all the people who matter in life.
[03:53:05.730 --> 03:53:09.013]  You didn't expect them to forget to pander to the alphabet people, did you?
[03:53:09.013 --> 03:53:10.995]  A 30-second ad.
[03:53:10.995 --> 03:53:14.978]  And in every single instance, they invoke some version of the message.
[03:53:14.978 --> 03:53:16.860]  What is it about Christmas ads?
[03:53:16.980 --> 03:53:30.984]  It's like they get so angered at what Christmas is supposed to represent, faith, family, tradition, wholesomeness, Jesus Christ, that not only do they have to sully it with appeals to vapid consumerism, they have to snidely subvert the foundation of the entire thing.
[03:53:30.984 --> 03:53:34.925]  Unfortunately for Not On The High Street, they forgot to turn off the comments.
[03:53:34.925 --> 03:53:37.486]  In terms of degenerative art, this is by Martia.
[03:53:37.486 --> 03:53:42.827]  Imagine if you rephrased your advert to, sorry you have to share your special day with Eid Diwali Hanukkah.
[03:53:42.827 --> 03:53:46.228]  Obviously, Not On The High Street has a selective discriminative policy.
[03:53:46.328 --> 03:53:47.129]  Not on the high street.
[03:53:47.129 --> 03:53:48.913]  It's not in my internet bookmarks anymore.
[03:53:48.913 --> 03:53:51.818]  This is the most disgusting Christmas advert I've ever seen.
[03:53:51.818 --> 03:53:53.701]  I know exactly where never to shop.
[03:53:53.701 --> 03:53:55.424]  THE MESSAGE!
[03:53:55.424 --> 03:53:59.030]  Yeah, seems like the message isn't being received very well.
[03:54:01.707 --> 03:54:10.853]  Now, the update on that is that not only did they remove the comment section, but they removed the video entirely off of YouTube, so maybe they weren't so proud of it in the end.
[03:54:10.853 --> 03:54:27.163]  Meanwhile, also in the UK, Strep A kills more children than Covid did in its first year, basically because they kept kids away from school, their immunity was completely exposed, they had no national immunity to everything, and now kids across the country are dying of Strep A. Professor Carl Hennigan,
[03:54:27.771 --> 03:54:28.051]  Yeah, I think.
[03:54:45.569 --> 03:54:46.509]  Guess what?
[03:54:46.509 --> 03:54:47.850]  To wear masks!
[03:54:47.850 --> 03:54:54.151]  Let's get to this final video now, though, because this is a very important subject in terms of climate change and the Great Reset Agenda.
[03:54:54.151 --> 03:54:56.712]  This is called The War on Farmers.
[03:54:56.712 --> 03:54:57.892]  Let's roll it.
[03:54:57.892 --> 03:55:05.093]  Well, you've seen the war on farmers in the Netherlands, and now our esteemed globalist technocrats are pulling the same stunt in Germany.
[03:55:05.093 --> 03:55:11.675]  Farmers in Germany's most popular state, North Rhine-Westphalia, have been ordered to rein in the use of fertilizer.
[03:55:11.715 --> 03:55:19.119]  Green bureaucrats have told them to use 20% less nitrate fertilizer in areas deemed to have problematic levels of the chemical.
[03:55:19.119 --> 03:55:23.021]  The demand is all part of the plan to make the industry more green.
[03:55:23.021 --> 03:55:28.304]  An inconvenient knock-on effect is that it will severely impact the amount of food they're allowed to grow.
[03:55:28.304 --> 03:55:33.487]  A wheat field requiring 200 kilograms of fertilizer will now have to use 40 kilograms less.
[03:55:33.607 --> 03:55:37.590]  Meaning a drop in both the quantity and the quality of the wheat harvested.
[03:55:37.590 --> 03:55:43.094]  Technocrats in the region passed the rule right before Christmas, and then they all promptly buggered off on holiday.
[03:55:43.094 --> 03:55:46.056]  Meaning no one can even challenge the mandate until next year.
[03:55:46.056 --> 03:55:49.638]  The rules appear to be unpopular with some local farmers and political officials.
[03:55:49.638 --> 03:55:58.644]  Eric Gossen, Vice President of the Rheinisch Agricultural Association, warned that the new regulations would mean a lower quality of crop, hinting farmers would not accept the rules without a fight.
[03:55:58.644 --> 03:56:02.847]  There is great indignation among the farmers, which really upsets, as he told German news outlet,
[03:56:03.187 --> 03:56:13.231]  The move is similar to what's already unfolding in the Netherlands, where the government is enforcing compulsory purchases of thousands of farms that don't meet environmental regulations.
[03:56:13.231 --> 03:56:15.652]  Those farms will then all be shut down.
[03:56:15.652 --> 03:56:22.875]  In a country which is second in terms of world exports of food, the measures have produced widespread sustained civil unrest.
[03:56:22.875 --> 03:56:24.976]  We can't allow farmers to farm!
[03:56:25.216 --> 03:56:25.896]  Are you mad?
[03:56:25.896 --> 03:56:28.958]  Letting the agriculture industry produce food?
[03:56:28.958 --> 03:56:29.838]  Can't have that!
[03:56:29.838 --> 03:56:33.520]  How are we going to control people and make them all dependent on us if we allow that to happen?
[03:56:33.520 --> 03:56:35.221]  I mean, it's for the planet, right?
[03:56:35.221 --> 03:56:39.243]  So I guess both the Dutch and now Germans will just have to eat the bugs.
[03:56:39.243 --> 03:56:44.346]  If only to save money, thanks to soaring inflation in Germany which just hit a record high.
[03:56:44.346 --> 03:56:48.768]  One quarter of Germans can't even afford to buy Christmas presents for their kids this year.
[03:56:48.768 --> 03:56:50.589]  What's on the menu for Christmas dinner?
[03:56:50.589 --> 03:56:51.390]  Turkey, perhaps?
[03:56:51.875 --> 03:56:52.876]  Eh, a bit expensive.
[03:56:52.876 --> 03:56:53.818]  But don't worry.
[03:56:53.818 --> 03:56:56.421]  There are reasons to put insects on the Christmas menu.
[03:56:56.421 --> 03:56:57.302]  Mmm, lovely!
[03:56:57.302 --> 03:56:58.203]  What's for dessert?
[03:56:58.203 --> 03:57:00.025]  Edible mealworm in banoffee pie!
[03:57:00.025 --> 03:57:01.387]  I've suddenly lost my appetite.
[03:57:03.362 --> 03:57:05.524]  Now this isn't just in Holland or Germany.
[03:57:05.524 --> 03:57:09.208]  Now the UK is facing a food supply crisis.
[03:57:09.208 --> 03:57:21.701]  We've got rationing on eggs in supermarkets and again it's largely because of these environmental restrictions that they're imposing on farmers with nitrogen fertilizer massively increasing in price.
[03:57:21.701 --> 03:57:24.504]  It's absolutely devastating the farming community.
[03:57:25.180 --> 03:57:33.402]  And now we're going to have food rationing and our food security is going to be offshored to other countries exactly how they want it.
[03:57:33.402 --> 03:57:34.843]  They want you dependent.
[03:57:34.843 --> 03:57:37.403]  They don't want farmers producing cheap food.
[03:57:37.403 --> 03:57:39.644]  They don't want us to have access to cheap energy.
[03:57:39.644 --> 03:57:42.605]  It's all about the deliberate reduction of living standards.
[03:57:42.605 --> 03:57:43.525]  The Great Reset.
[03:57:43.525 --> 03:57:44.465]  I was going to wrap it up.
[03:57:44.465 --> 03:57:45.306]  War Room is next.
[03:57:45.306 --> 03:57:45.946]  Don't go away.
[03:57:45.946 --> 03:57:46.226]  Summit.
[03:57:47.259 --> 03:57:54.244]  It's hard to believe sometimes that we are still live on air, broadcasting free worldwide.
[03:57:54.244 --> 03:57:59.447]  And it seems quite real that things can change in an instant.
[03:57:59.447 --> 03:58:06.492]  Things are getting very weird, and it's definitely more difficult than ever to even know what's going on.
[03:58:06.492 --> 03:58:09.674]  But we'll keep doing our best, so long as you keep us on the air.
[03:58:10.514 --> 03:58:14.675]  And you can do that now at InfowarStore.com.
[03:58:14.675 --> 03:58:21.136]  Help us clear out our stock of bodies' turmeric, vitamin C with zinc, and alpha power.
[03:58:21.136 --> 03:58:28.557]  Turn those shady Federal Reserve notes into the highest quality supplements available, while they still last.
[03:58:28.557 --> 03:58:31.778]  Now, with free shipping.
[03:58:31.778 --> 03:58:38.039]  We thank you for your support, and we wish you a very peaceful, happy, and Merry Christmas.
[03:58:46.701 --> 03:58:52.688]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[03:58:52.688 --> 03:58:56.832]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
