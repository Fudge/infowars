[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.313]   InfoWars.com Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:23.193]  today. Well, we made it.
[00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:25.139]  Another day.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.320]  Thank God.
[00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:31.523]  Here on this spaceship Earth that we all live on, hurtling through space.
[00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:34.183]  orbiting the sun.
[00:00:34.183 --> 00:00:40.542]  I'm sitting here.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:51.703]  Getting ready for the broadcast last few hours, trying to think of what headline do I put out to accurately describe just how serious the situation is on this planet today.
[00:00:55.004 --> 00:01:05.047]  And none of us really can process the danger we're all in because humans have never, at least in recorded history that we know of, faced anything like we're dealing with right now.
[00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:13.113]  We have a proxy war between NATO and Russia that the United States on record is commanding and running in Ukraine.
[00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:30.196]  And as it becomes clear that Russia is winning that war to take over the east of Ukraine and 90% of their industrial and energy capacity, the West is escalating and sending in heavier and heavier weapons, including long-range missiles.
[00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:42.596]   And Putin said on Friday That if that continued, they would start targeting Western cities, including the possible use of nuclear weapons.
[00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:50.438]  And then the next day, a bunch of cruise missiles hit Kiev, blowing up arms depots.
[00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.878]  That's a pretty big deal.
[00:01:53.538 --> 00:01:58.379]  And that's back in the newspaper, because they've already moved on to the Evaldi shooting.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.380]  They moved from COVID.
[00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:12.138]  To Ukraine, to Monkeypox, to Givaldi, and it's all a distraction from the ongoing design economic collapse of the Western world by design.
[00:02:12.158 --> 00:02:13.939]  But we'll be going over all of this today.
[00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.720]  Russian military strikes Kiev.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.561]  Putin issues warning to the West.
[00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:22.003]  MSM, AP, Russia hits Kiev with missiles.
[00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:23.704]  Putin warns West on arms.
[00:02:25.765 --> 00:02:29.827]  Russia targets Western-supplied tank depot in Kiev in rare cruise missile attack.
[00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:36.086]  Russia threatens direct attacks on Western cities for providing long-range missiles to Ukraine.
[00:02:37.227 --> 00:02:39.447]  Putin officially says it could even be nuclear war.
[00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.349]  This is a very serious situation.
[00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.188]  Zelensky now admits they're losing the war.
[00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:55.068]   The globalists just want to have an ongoing, prolonged operation
[00:02:55.068 --> 00:02:58.269]  where they can launder hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:02:58.885 --> 00:03:04.167]  It's over $100 billion since February that the West, over $60 billion from the U.S.
[00:03:04.247 --> 00:03:08.749]  of it, another $40 billion from other states, has been pumped into that war zone.
[00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.814]  And even the Pope had to admit three weeks ago, I'm no fan of the globalist Pope, that okay, NATO overthrew the elected president of Ukraine eight years ago.
[00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.627]  And they've been pushing out Russians into the east when the Russians are from Ukraine.
[00:03:22.647 --> 00:03:24.008]  That's where Russia started.
[00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.630]  And you need to stop.
[00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:32.133]  Even Henry Kissinger came out last week and says, OK, we need to make a peace deal.
[00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:33.094]  This needs to stop now.
[00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:38.677]  But the neocons and others, they want a big war.
[00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:53.309]   So if you thought World War II was bad, killing over 100 million people, 20-something million Russians, 20-something million Germans, the lion's share, Well, you ain't seen nothing yet, and we are sleepwalking into this.
[00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:00.494]  You know, they just had World War I relatively soon, shortly before World War II, in which tens of millions died.
[00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:04.136]  And they still had that giant war.
[00:04:05.377 --> 00:04:07.439]  World War I was supposedly the war to end all wars.
[00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.681]  So you had a population aware of how bad war is.
[00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:11.381]  It still happened.
[00:04:12.802 --> 00:04:18.106]  Imagine now, where we've got people that just watch Netflix all day and believe that men can have babies.
[00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:22.881]  And all the rest of this while we are sleepwalking into Armageddon.
[00:04:24.362 --> 00:04:25.903]  That's just one of the stats we've got.
[00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:29.185]  All hell broke loose in Dallas yesterday.
[00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:31.547]  Alex Stein is going to be joining us and others.
[00:04:32.288 --> 00:04:42.075]  They had a grooming, pedo, drag queen storytime celebration where they had little kids like trophies at an adult stripper gay bar.
[00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:45.648]  And some patriots showed up and all hell broke loose.
[00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:51.191]  That ties into Satanism demystified and the heart of the problem when we come back.
[00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:53.792]  And then of course other big reports here.
[00:04:54.492 --> 00:04:54.712]  U.S.
[00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:59.814]  Social Security and Medicare approach insolvency warn the trustee boards.
[00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:07.458]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:05:07.298 --> 00:05:14.298]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:05:14.298 --> 00:05:22.298]   Make no mistake, my friends, we are living in an incredibly historic time, a true crossroads in the future of humanity.
[00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.856]  We'll put that headline back on screen for TV viewers.
[00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:29.617]  I'll read it out for radio listeners because it says it all.
[00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:33.618]  Emergency Sunday broadcast.
[00:05:34.338 --> 00:05:40.799]  Putin officially threatens to nuke Western cities if NATO continues escalation in Ukraine.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.780]  Wow!
[00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:48.443]  We'll be covering that at the bottom of the hour in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:05:50.423 --> 00:05:55.065]  We've got the Davos Group announcing world government and what is going to be in that world government.
[00:05:55.485 --> 00:05:58.826]  And they've released 10 statements about the world you live in.
[00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:02.307]  You couldn't make up something more dystopic and nightmarish.
[00:06:03.376 --> 00:06:15.186]  That's coming up next segment as the Bilderberg Group, on hiatus for two years, that's the secret group that founded Dabos, meets in DC at the Grand Orient Hotel.
[00:06:15.246 --> 00:06:22.732]  We've got a lot of exclusive intel and information on that as we identify who is orchestrating this worldwide crisis.
[00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:42.814]   And then on the economic front, the trustees Of Social Security and Medicare, two different boards have come out last week, got no coverage except in the Epoch Times, and said that U.S.
[00:06:42.854 --> 00:06:48.078]  Social Security and Medicare are approaching insolvency, warns trustees.
[00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:51.280]  That means going bankrupt, kaput, with the inflation.
[00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:52.862]  And believe me, it's already done.
[00:06:54.159 --> 00:07:27.427]   Ultra massive information and then you have the head of the Commerce Department asked on national television on the Sunday news show What are you gonna do about 79% of the baby formula being totally sold out across the country as high as 90% in some areas And she didn't even respond to that and just sidestepped the question I mean it is Believable to be living in this, and I'm here to tell you, I'd be a liar if I told you that things were about to get better.
[00:07:27.787 --> 00:07:28.928]  They're going to get a lot worse.
[00:07:30.049 --> 00:07:31.249]  At least we know it's coming.
[00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:40.615]  You know, the last car wreck I was in, thank God I hadn't been in one in a long time, was 12 years ago.
[00:07:40.635 --> 00:07:49.100]  I was driving back, visiting family in Fredericksburg, Texas, where my uncle and aunt lived, and then moved to East Texas.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:56.464]  There were a bunch of storms forming in between Austin and Fredericksburg.
[00:07:56.484 --> 00:08:04.910]  I remember my great, it wasn't my great grandmother, but my great wonderful grandmother saying, you know, I want to get in the car and I want to go.
[00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.732]  I got a feeling the storms can be bad.
[00:08:08.172 --> 00:08:09.013]  You need to leave too.
[00:08:09.793 --> 00:08:21.600]   We waited an hour longer and drank coffee and shot guns after my grandmother and my now ex-wife And my three children got in their car and left back to Austin.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.422]  We drank some more coffee and shot some more guns off the porch because he lived up on this big hilltop.
[00:08:27.462 --> 00:08:30.723]  You can shoot a thousand yards down at targets we had.
[00:08:32.984 --> 00:08:38.066]  And I'm driving down the highway and I hit Johnson City, where LBJ's from.
[00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:41.468]  I'm driving 50 because it's raining so hard and there's wind blowing.
[00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:47.010]  And my Tahoe gets thrown off the road where there's 60, 70 foot embankments going down.
[00:08:50.302 --> 00:08:56.225]  And it started spinning and then ran into a bunch of oak trees.
[00:08:56.965 --> 00:08:59.486]  But thank God, it was me and my dad in the car.
[00:09:00.787 --> 00:09:05.469]  It hit the back of us and crushed the whole vehicle, more than half the Tahoe into where we were.
[00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:06.950]  My dad got a concussion.
[00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.811]  I was okay.
[00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:11.552]  You know, the steering wheel broke and our seats broke.
[00:09:11.632 --> 00:09:12.452]  It hit us so hard.
[00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:27.100]   The reason I tell that story is when we start spinning on the road, From the storm, and the most important part of the story is coming in a moment, it felt like a lifetime.
[00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:41.686]  And then as we shot down over the embankment backwards, down a 60-70 foot gully, through a fence, into a bunch of oak trees, I remember looking at my dad and saying, brace for impact.
[00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:45.528]  And that's the moment we're in right now.
[00:09:46.872 --> 00:09:50.835]  But what engineered, what was the storm that brought us this place?
[00:09:52.376 --> 00:10:08.807]  The New World Order, the Great Reset, the big central banks getting ready to pop their world financial bubble and pose as saviors instead of the authors of our problems and totally take over the planet with the New World Market to Beast Casual Society that's now been officially announced.
[00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:17.828]   So the way tornadoes work, if you haven't lived in Tornado Alley like Goes down from Illinois right down to Central Texas, kind of ends in Austin.
[00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:23.254]  Is... Sky will be blue, then it's black, then it's green.
[00:10:24.318 --> 00:10:27.320]  And should have known it was a tornado because the sky was green.
[00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:32.884]  When we're just driving 45 miles an hour down the highway, it's raining high wind, the tornado hit.
[00:10:33.224 --> 00:10:36.806]  When the state police got there, like in 10 minutes, they said, you're lucky to be alive.
[00:10:37.507 --> 00:10:41.269]  We just were parked down the road and watched it destroy that barn across the street.
[00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.611]  And you were hit by the tornado.
[00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:46.273]  And we watched the tornado throw you off the road.
[00:10:46.473 --> 00:10:49.875]  See, I thought the car was spinning because I was like, this is weird.
[00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:54.018]  The car spinning down the highway for spinning six, seven, eight times.
[00:10:55.019 --> 00:11:00.042]  Like in Wizard of Oz when Dorothy's in the house and it, you know, it's picked up.
[00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:03.004]  I'm like, why is this car just spinning down the road?
[00:11:03.884 --> 00:11:14.071]  And then, because a tornado, we were in a tornado, taking us down the road and then spit us out, shooting us down a hill.
[00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:17.149]  That was a miracle we lived.
[00:11:17.849 --> 00:11:20.370]  But my point is, that was nature.
[00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.530]  That was the earth.
[00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.430]  That was the world.
[00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.211]  And God gave us the good sense that we should have left right away, or we should have stayed.
[00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:27.631]  My grandmother said, we're leaving.
[00:11:27.651 --> 00:11:28.532]  Those storms are dangerous.
[00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:33.213]  See, these aren't acts of nature, acts of God.
[00:11:33.733 --> 00:11:35.233]  The globalists are the tornado.
[00:11:35.813 --> 00:11:45.135]  And if we don't recognize that they're the storm, and they're the tornado, and they're the bad guys, and they're the people causing all of this, we're done.
[00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:51.939]  But I didn't know until the tornado went by and the state police were like, we were parked down the road and saw it happen.
[00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.599]  We've never seen anything like it.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.601]  Their mouths were hanging open because they'd never seen a car grabbed by a tornado.
[00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.722]  I was in it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:04.822 --> 00:12:05.822]  Talk about a weird world.
[00:12:05.842 --> 00:12:06.923]  Talk about a weird life.
[00:12:07.583 --> 00:12:10.443]  But I'm done talking about all that.
[00:12:12.024 --> 00:12:37.283]   The point is, is that The viruses and the open borders and the collapsing currencies and all the open pedophilia and the shortages and all of this is because the New World Order doubled and tripled and quadrupled its profits the last 30 months of this and they're running the whole show and they are consolidating power and control and they are orchestrating and triggering every bit of these crises.
[00:12:38.843 --> 00:12:47.194]   But the issue is they're in the storm too and these crises Have already gotten out of control.
[00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:51.556]  So when we come back, I want to look at the root causes of all this.
[00:12:52.756 --> 00:13:00.179]  And let me tell you, we got a lot of fabulous researchers and reporters here like Christy Lee and Owen Schroer and so many others.
[00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:01.659]  They all do great jobs.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:10.303]   But Greg Reese, who's worked here now five years, Just does better and better and better all the time.
[00:13:10.803 --> 00:13:19.889]  And I asked him six months ago, I said, I want a report on the origins of Satanism and how it is conquest versus Renaissance.
[00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:22.170]  And I usually have asked him to do a report.
[00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.590]  He does it.
[00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.271]  He never did it.
[00:13:24.031 --> 00:13:25.952]  He called me yesterday and he said, I've done it.
[00:13:26.793 --> 00:13:27.313]  Watch this.
[00:13:27.433 --> 00:13:28.714]  Satanism demystified.
[00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:31.556]  And he's done so many reports.
[00:13:32.116 --> 00:13:35.298]  And I'm always saying, man, this is his best report because they just keep getting better and better.
[00:13:39.617 --> 00:13:45.362]  But this one is so key and it's just like PragerU has four or five minute videos that tell you so much.
[00:13:45.963 --> 00:13:51.247]  He's kind of our PragerU because they're short, they're sweet, they're true, they're powerful.
[00:13:51.748 --> 00:13:55.191]  If you understand what's happening in the world, it's becoming satanic.
[00:13:55.451 --> 00:13:56.572]  It's always had problems.
[00:13:56.672 --> 00:13:57.593]  We've always been falling.
[00:13:57.973 --> 00:14:05.880]  But everything the New World Order does is predatory and is there to hurt you by design because they think that's a good thing.
[00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:08.619]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:15.666]  I'm going to tie it into everything that is unfolding with the economy and Russia threatening nuclear war again.
[00:14:15.687 --> 00:14:18.029]  Now people are just getting punch drunk to that.
[00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:20.471]  And we've got special guests on.
[00:14:20.551 --> 00:14:33.337]   Alex Stein was up in Dallas where they had a grooming pedo event, pedo grooming, drag queen children dancing at a Homosexual strip club.
[00:14:34.277 --> 00:14:40.820]  All of this is coming up on the other side of this special Sunday, June 5th, 2022 broadcast.
[00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.920]  I'm so honored to be here.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.941]  So thankful to all the listeners and viewers and affiliates and crew.
[00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:48.322]  We have been through so much together, but we're stronger than ever.
[00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:49.943]  And that is just an answer to prayer.
[00:14:49.983 --> 00:14:51.303]  So thank you all for your prayer.
[00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:52.824]  And thank you all for your support.
[00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:54.004]  Everybody tune in now.
[00:14:54.043 --> 00:14:57.043]  This is critical information coming up.
[00:14:57.043 --> 00:15:00.524]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:04.004]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:07.482]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:07.482 --> 00:15:10.963]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:10.963 --> 00:15:14.443]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:14.443 --> 00:15:17.923]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:17.923 --> 00:15:21.403]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:21.403 --> 00:15:24.883]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:15:24.883 --> 00:15:42.644]  Alex Stein's going to be joining us.
[00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:44.728]  I'll cover Bilderberg and Rood in the Dave Ostrup Huge Developments next segment.
[00:15:44.748 --> 00:15:53.356]  But I want to go to the very nature of why these people are so evil and why they think hurting and killing people is a sign of their power and something they feel compelled to do.
[00:15:54.514 --> 00:16:00.677]  So before I play this very important report that's on Infowars.com and Band.video, Satanism Demystified.
[00:16:01.257 --> 00:16:03.678]  Couldn't be a more important four and a half minutes to watch.
[00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:05.459]  We're going to premiere here in a moment.
[00:16:05.859 --> 00:16:07.540]  Let me show you some of the background here.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.241]  It is the Fortune 1000.
[00:16:09.421 --> 00:16:11.562]  It is the Fortune 500.
[00:16:11.742 --> 00:16:31.510]   It is the most powerful people and universities and think tanks and banks that are pushing transgenderism Because I have a clip next segment of Fox News telling you about human animal clones being made and how last year they wouldn't even pass a law to block it.
[00:16:34.092 --> 00:16:44.017]  If you'll accept that a man can have a baby, if you'll accept five-year-olds being taught how to give blowjobs and being taken to gay bars to dance in front of people, you'll accept anything.
[00:16:44.277 --> 00:16:45.197]  And that's what's happening.
[00:16:45.217 --> 00:16:46.258]  We're being trained right now.
[00:16:47.478 --> 00:16:50.260]  European Union Commission declares the future is queer.
[00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:56.229]  In their youth children's Twitter account, targeted to schools and children.
[00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.092]  Well, that means there's no future, because if you don't have children, you die.
[00:17:01.452 --> 00:17:02.253]  And that's the target.
[00:17:02.993 --> 00:17:06.355]  So they go, oh, be open-minded, don't be mean to people that like the same sex.
[00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:07.615]  You're like, okay, well, I don't hate you.
[00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:09.496]  Okay, well, your kids belong to me.
[00:17:09.957 --> 00:17:16.200]  Well, that's not being homosexual, that's being a pedophile, or being a groomer for these people.
[00:17:17.205 --> 00:17:19.306]  Big report on Infowars.com from Breitbart.
[00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:24.488]  Biden threatens to take away school lunch money that doesn't adhere to Trans Agenda.
[00:17:24.828 --> 00:17:31.752]  They can feed your kids and control that, well they can tell them what they're going to hear at age 5, again, to confuse their gender, which is by design.
[00:17:33.212 --> 00:17:38.054]  Pizza Hut goes full woke recommending drag queen books inside the pizza boxes.
[00:17:38.595 --> 00:17:41.256]  Ads for drag queen books as kids as young as 5.
[00:17:41.496 --> 00:17:45.618]  It's not drag queen, it's teaching your child to have sex with the same sex.
[00:17:47.363 --> 00:17:48.124]  It shouldn't be going on.
[00:17:48.204 --> 00:17:48.564]  Period.
[00:17:48.604 --> 00:17:49.865]  Heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:17:51.426 --> 00:17:54.829]  And it goes on and on and on from there.
[00:17:55.169 --> 00:17:59.592]  As Pride Month kicks off, it's time to give straight folks their parade too.
[00:17:59.632 --> 00:18:00.773]  Straight folks have their parade.
[00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:03.495]  It's called their children and grandparents and communities.
[00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:09.580]  Not a bunch of men dressed up like clowns calling themselves women demanding access to everybody's children.
[00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:17.286]  This is the vanguard of clowns to condition you to accept anything and everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:17.926 --> 00:18:20.149]  Creepy men masquerading as women.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.301]  Child exploitation exposed as groomer drag queen kick off Pride Month.
[00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:29.802]  We've got all the footage coming up at the end of the hour, next hour.
[00:18:30.123 --> 00:18:31.443]  And look at this photo here, TV viewer.
[00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.704]  Trans cyclist finished first and second in the UK.
[00:18:35.144 --> 00:18:39.325]  Kiss on the podium next to third place mom holding her baby.
[00:18:39.905 --> 00:18:41.866]  And the full photos on InfoWars.com.
[00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:46.030]  Where they're just towering above this woman that they barely beat.
[00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.210]  These men couldn't compete against men.
[00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.031]  Soon the entire sport will be men masquerading as women for the cash prizes.
[00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:56.672]  It's called bullying, it's called fraud, it's called disgust.
[00:18:57.892 --> 00:19:02.293]  And then of course they do a sexual act in front of everyone.
[00:19:02.613 --> 00:19:04.314]  It's a sex cult dominating you.
[00:19:05.554 --> 00:19:10.175]  Usually somebody comes up and starts talking about sex to you at the park or the grocery store, you call them a pervert!
[00:19:10.993 --> 00:19:14.536]  But oh, they're wrapped in the rainbow flag!
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.243]  Majorities say allowing preferred pronouns in schools confuses kids.
[00:19:23.623 --> 00:19:26.146]  National poll shows only 37% agree with it.
[00:19:26.166 --> 00:19:28.968]  Well that's 37% of people under Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:19:29.308 --> 00:19:37.855]  Targeting children who aren't even supposed to be thinking about sex to totally confuse them and have the state form a relationship with them about their identity that supersedes parental control.
[00:19:37.955 --> 00:19:38.556]  That's what it's about.
[00:19:39.926 --> 00:19:43.910]  Viral comedian assaulted while exposing drag queen grooming of children.
[00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.733]  That's coming up Alex Stein next hour.
[00:19:47.294 --> 00:19:53.600]  Bill Maher comes out again this week and says, we're losing civilization because of woke policies, homelessness, and drugs.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.945]  And he goes on to say, leave children alone, do not sexualize them.
[00:19:58.185 --> 00:20:00.307]  He's finally got a line he won't pass.
[00:20:01.168 --> 00:20:01.969]  Where is your line?
[00:20:04.707 --> 00:20:05.530]  And I went too far.
[00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.559]  I went too long on the segment to get to the report.
[00:20:08.579 --> 00:20:09.542]  I'll keep going with this.
[00:20:09.963 --> 00:20:12.290]  We'll come back and play the Satanism.
[00:20:13.544 --> 00:20:17.286]  Demystified Report, and then get into Bilderberg and the New World Order and the rest of it.
[00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:20.047]  Let's push Stein back to the start of the next hour.
[00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:22.748]  I had him on at 4.45 Central.
[00:20:22.768 --> 00:20:23.509]  We're live right now.
[00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:24.349]  It'll be archived.
[00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:26.470]  But let's just start clean with him.
[00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:34.034]  Second hour, so I have time to hit Bilderberg and the Globalist and everything that ties into who's controlling this, who's doing this in the final segment of this hour.
[00:20:34.074 --> 00:20:37.675]  But next segment, I'll get into this key report, Satanism Demystified.
[00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:38.616]  But I'll give you some background.
[00:20:39.896 --> 00:20:50.462]  House Republicans unveil restoring the American family agenda to combat left's culture war on and low birth rates, which is what it's all about, not having children.
[00:20:51.763 --> 00:21:01.968]  Meanwhile, Amazon, as you know, last week had a big die-in at their headquarters because Amazon won't ban books criticizing sterilizing six and seven-year-olds, the transgender movement.
[00:21:04.704 --> 00:21:07.528]  Demanding access to your children, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:09.391]  It doesn't get more evil.
[00:21:09.932 --> 00:21:11.073]  It doesn't get more sick.
[00:21:12.195 --> 00:21:13.817]  Destroying the innocence than that.
[00:21:13.877 --> 00:21:15.981]  And we've got that all coming up.
[00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:18.624]  And I want to hit the Satanism demystified and then tie it in.
[00:21:20.475 --> 00:21:34.686]  To the top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things pushed by the World Economic Forum and the latest exclusive information on Bilderberg Group 2022, the secret group that runs the Davos Group that the media doesn't want you to know about, meeting in Washington, DC.
[00:21:34.946 --> 00:21:36.567]  The meeting started ending today.
[00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:38.849]  Sometimes they extend it into Monday.
[00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:42.552]  We'll give you all the latest on that coming up as well.
[00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:48.096]  Separately, today is the last day to get the Memorial Day specials.

[00:23:57.496 --> 00:24:05.097]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:10.064]  There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[00:24:10.664 --> 00:24:14.488]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up.
[00:24:14.968 --> 00:24:17.110]  Some say they sacrifice children.
[00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.992]  And others believe they have magical powers.
[00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:22.575]  But the truth is much more simple.
[00:24:23.375 --> 00:24:27.777]  Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[00:24:28.297 --> 00:24:31.338]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[00:24:31.878 --> 00:24:38.360]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow man.
[00:24:39.682 --> 00:24:42.566]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[00:24:43.047 --> 00:24:49.716]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase, pimps and hoes.
[00:24:50.777 --> 00:24:52.980]  If these words upset you, good.
[00:24:53.681 --> 00:24:55.744]  We are talking about the nature of evil.
[00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:58.786]  And if it makes light of it, even better.
[00:24:59.266 --> 00:25:01.246]  These animals are nothing to fear.
[00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:09.488]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks, they are nothing more than pimps and hoes.
[00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:10.588]  Cannibals.
[00:25:11.129 --> 00:25:14.029]  Feeding off other people like predatory animals.
[00:25:14.469 --> 00:25:17.650]  Completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love.
[00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.351]  Satanism is base-level animal tribalism.
[00:25:21.771 --> 00:25:30.015]   An animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top The hoes they control, and the tricks they both exploit.
[00:25:31.056 --> 00:25:34.498]  This is the law of the jungle which has existed for millennia.
[00:25:35.379 --> 00:25:41.744]  A survival of the fittest, dog-eat-dog world, where the nice guys always finish last.
[00:25:42.564 --> 00:25:57.151]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-Christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense, because we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love, where everyone is equally welcome.
[00:25:58.271 --> 00:26:07.254]  There is much talk about a battle being waged between good and evil, but this sort of simple black and white duality only exists in our mind.
[00:26:07.674 --> 00:26:13.376]  In reality, what's going on is a balancing act between our spirit and our body.
[00:26:14.116 --> 00:26:22.698]  While our spirit may be drawn to love and light, our body is an animal with innate animal instincts that cannot easily be suppressed.
[00:26:23.418 --> 00:26:29.460]  And like every other species of animal, the primary instincts are survival and reproduction.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.301]  So as far as mammals go, the female is the ultimate prize in the game of life.
[00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:43.067]  A society built upon a Christian ethos of brotherly love is one that honors individual freedom.
[00:26:43.547 --> 00:26:52.894]  And the way to satisfy our animal desires for survival with brotherly love is through marriage and raising a family with some degree of selflessness.
[00:26:54.096 --> 00:27:04.819]  And without the Christian ethos of brotherly love, the Satanist simply sees women as the most valued commodity to be bought and sold for one's own selfish desire.
[00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:06.459]  Pimps and hoes.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:13.421]  Whether it be in the poorest communities or at the top of the pyramid, Satanism is all about control.
[00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:19.563]  And the ones at the top have invested everything into their technocratic pop culture media machine.
[00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:22.145]  Which is their main method of pimping.
[00:27:22.566 --> 00:27:25.489]  And they see the brainwashed masses as their hoes.
[00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.953]  Because according to the laws of the jungle, they own them.
[00:27:29.574 --> 00:27:31.896]  Which is why they resent the Christian ethos.
[00:27:32.317 --> 00:27:35.420]  Because it is the only thing on earth that stands against them.
[00:27:36.462 --> 00:27:43.449]  But the real problem with Satanism is that it keeps an individual from knowing God and discovering their true path.
[00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:56.423]  Our free will allows us the choice to either transcend spiritually, which requires a personal relationship with God, or descend into the animal kingdom and forever remain a beast.
[00:27:57.604 --> 00:28:02.110]  Which is what the pimps and hoes are ultimately selling, but we don't have to buy it.
[00:28:02.731 --> 00:28:06.996]  Satanic influence has always been with us, and it is nothing to fear.
[00:28:07.677 --> 00:28:10.520]  These Satanist pimps are not gods.
[00:28:11.121 --> 00:28:14.805]  They are merely animals playing mind tricks and spinning lies.
[00:28:15.746 --> 00:28:19.267]  Redemption is for everyone and humanity has a choice.
[00:28:19.947 --> 00:28:32.591]  We can either submit to the beast system and live like animals or we can follow the Christian impulse for brotherly love and stand up against evil so that our children will know freedom.
[00:28:34.392 --> 00:28:36.833]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:28:39.465 --> 00:28:48.012]  That report's on the front page of InfoWars.com, but I'm gonna have it added in the live show feed under the live broadcast link for everybody so you can share it.
[00:28:49.092 --> 00:28:53.556]  Greg Reese has a lot of reports that get 2-3 million views, most get about a half a million, they all need to get 50 million views.
[00:28:54.877 --> 00:28:58.620]  Our mission here is to reach people, and I appreciate you all being part of that mission.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.242]  You are right beside us in that fight, and I salute you all.
[00:29:04.764 --> 00:29:05.585]  We have a choice to make.
[00:29:06.966 --> 00:29:10.207]  We can be part of the beast system, or we can be part of God's system.
[00:29:10.227 --> 00:29:14.548]  And that doesn't mean you're going to find it at these candy-ass churches full of a bunch of Pharisees.
[00:29:16.268 --> 00:29:26.531]  It means that you have a decision whether you want to be part of the predator class and be destroyed in the process, not just physically but spiritually, or whether you want to be part of the winning team.
[00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:30.132]  There are economies of conquest and economies of renaissance.
[00:29:31.983 --> 00:29:41.686]  And if you read the UN documents that I cover in Endgame, in the 60s they said, we'll promote homosexuality, we'll break the family up, we will bring back paganism and even human sacrifice.
[00:29:42.966 --> 00:29:43.626]  That's in Endgame.
[00:29:44.466 --> 00:29:45.067]  With the quotes.
[00:29:45.807 --> 00:29:54.209]  And you watch that film that's free online still, one version had 80 million views, they took it down, but the other ones have 5 million, 6 million, 3 million views, you can find it.
[00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:55.029]  Endgame.
[00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:56.710]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.750]  Go watch that 2007 film.
[00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:00.731]  It's my best work yet.
[00:30:01.636 --> 00:30:03.558]  Never made Endgame 2 because I've just been too busy.
[00:30:04.098 --> 00:30:05.900]  Plus, you can just see the Endgame here for yourself.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.203]  You don't need to make another film, really, do you?
[00:30:09.243 --> 00:30:11.725]  Because Part 1 already told you everything.
[00:30:12.445 --> 00:30:14.807]  People watch it now, and they flip out.
[00:30:15.368 --> 00:30:24.436]  In fact, we'll find a link to something that's still on YouTube or wherever, and we'll link it up on the live show feed as well underneath Greg Reese's report.
[00:30:25.056 --> 00:30:26.057]  Satanism Demystified.
[00:30:26.077 --> 00:30:28.219]  There's a copy on Bandoff Video as well.
[00:30:31.817 --> 00:30:34.738]  All right, let's talk about who actually controls this.
[00:30:35.899 --> 00:30:39.341]  Let's talk about who actually runs this.
[00:30:40.321 --> 00:30:45.824]  And again, call them sociopaths, call them sociopaths.
[00:30:46.404 --> 00:30:50.667]  That's just terms that 200-year-old German psychology came up with.
[00:30:51.967 --> 00:30:59.191]  It doesn't mean that modern psychology doesn't have some real things it talks about, but it's man labeling things that are already going on.
[00:31:00.072 --> 00:31:02.993]  And then really most of psychology is being used against us now, we know.
[00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:13.577]  And most people that are part of that system in advertising and government are engaged in weaponization of psychology and behavioral psychology for control.
[00:31:13.657 --> 00:31:18.718]  Pavlovian manipulation, opera conditioning, the list goes on and on.
[00:31:20.439 --> 00:31:31.785]   And people that engage in that type of predatory behavior are pretending That it doesn't affect them and that they're winning by doing it.
[00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:43.779]  And I've used the analogy of going to the local community pool and not just pissing in the pool, but taking a crap in the pool.
[00:31:45.201 --> 00:31:47.343]  One person does it, it ruins it for everybody.
[00:31:48.104 --> 00:31:49.646]  Why don't you just get up and go to the bathroom?
[00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:54.251]  Well, Satanist just says, I'm in charge, I'm God, like cancer in the body.
[00:31:54.631 --> 00:31:56.632]  I'll do whatever I want, but you kill the whole body.
[00:31:56.892 --> 00:31:58.853]  But let's not use the analogy I've used a hundred times.
[00:31:58.893 --> 00:31:59.513]  Let's use another one.
[00:32:02.774 --> 00:32:07.375]  If you live in a decent neighborhood, and you just decided you were going to start robbing houses.
[00:32:09.316 --> 00:32:10.516]  Don't need the money, but you're going to do it.
[00:32:11.974 --> 00:32:13.895]  Maybe you decide you're going to start burning houses down.
[00:32:14.496 --> 00:32:17.518]  You know, you burn down one house in the neighborhood, it's going to drive down property values 5%.
[00:32:18.459 --> 00:32:19.260]  You burn down two, 10%.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.561]  You burn down three, 30%.
[00:32:21.822 --> 00:32:25.985]  You burn down four or five, everybody's going to put up for sale signs and leave.
[00:32:28.683 --> 00:32:36.488]  Now maybe you're the globalist banks that are engaged in arsenal society, because once everybody leaves, you buy out every penny of the dollar, and that's really their mode of operation.
[00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:46.413]  But they are positioning Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid that the trustees of the federal board have said it's already basically insolvent.
[00:32:47.134 --> 00:32:48.474]  They are collapsing the border.
[00:32:48.735 --> 00:32:50.135]  They are collapsing the currency.
[00:32:50.396 --> 00:32:51.936]  They are shutting off all the energy.
[00:32:52.217 --> 00:32:57.740]  If I see one more headline of like, Biden can do nothing, there's nothing we can do to lower energy prices.
[00:32:59.795 --> 00:33:01.137]  They cut off the pipelines.
[00:33:01.697 --> 00:33:03.799]  They said we're not going to have fuel in the future.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.342]  They killed almost all the drilling permits.
[00:33:08.725 --> 00:33:11.247]  That's like, you don't gas your car up, you wonder why it runs out of gas.
[00:33:11.488 --> 00:33:13.330]  Gee, I don't know why my car's out of gas.
[00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.531]  There's plenty of gas.
[00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:16.153]  They won't let you gas it up.
[00:33:18.473 --> 00:33:20.695]  All right, I'm going to come back and look at the problem, who's running it.
[00:33:21.216 --> 00:33:23.338]  Because by identifying these folks, we're going to have major victory.
[00:33:23.358 --> 00:33:30.106]  And then we're going to look at these pedophile drag queen story time events now happening everywhere with children drug into topless bars.
[00:33:30.126 --> 00:33:31.407]  All right, we'll be right back.
[00:33:31.226 --> 00:33:47.785]  Stay with us.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.841]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:51.461 --> 00:33:53.622]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:54.322 --> 00:33:56.763]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[00:33:57.304 --> 00:33:59.845]  Sooner or later, gotta cut you down.
[00:34:01.946 --> 00:34:12.951]  Go tell that long-tongued liar... The show, we just talked about the ruling class of the pimps, and the rest of us, the hoes, the slaves, and the tricks that are getting played.
[00:34:14.758 --> 00:34:20.562]  Now the slaves are made by their slave masters to go out and commit crimes against others, or they will be attacked, they will be destroyed.
[00:34:20.582 --> 00:34:22.744]  But in the end, we all get destroyed.
[00:34:24.144 --> 00:34:30.049]  And to illustrate that, there's a big article on Infowars.com from Zero Hedge that just broke.
[00:34:30.549 --> 00:34:43.302]   New York Times op-ed applauds inflation as means to enforce green diet, make you eat bugs, make you drink sewage, make you not have a car, Carbon lockdowns.
[00:34:43.342 --> 00:34:45.444]  We told you that was coming 30 months ago.
[00:34:46.084 --> 00:34:47.145]  It's in their own documents.
[00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:49.547]  That story is on Infowars.com right now.
[00:34:51.689 --> 00:35:04.841]  So before I hit the top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things pushed by the World Economic Forum, let's go to a clip from Fox News reporting what was happening a year ago.
[00:35:06.064 --> 00:35:14.867]  About how they wouldn't even in a law funding biotech research say you can't cross humans and animals and then create these creatures.
[00:35:15.687 --> 00:35:17.988]  And whatever you're being told about it's 30 years ahead of that.
[00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:48.212]   Now how satanic is it if Satanism is making humans a commodity, not caring about free will, enslaving people, euthanizing old, killing the babies, And saying it's fun and cool, but all the big reckless corporations, all the big arrogant psychopathic corporations are behind it while they claim they're the avant-garde pushing for people's rights for the state to have access with men dressed up like clowns to your children at drag queen pedophile time.
[00:35:50.153 --> 00:36:04.988]   So here's a clip from Fox News talking about the Senate Passing the Endless Frontier Act, which allowed the human chimeras, because China's doing it, we can't get caught.
[00:36:05.888 --> 00:36:10.389]  It's like in Dr. Strangelove, based on real things that happened with Curtis LeMay and others in the early 60s.
[00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:20.051]  Well, if the Russians are going to build a doomsday bomb that blows the whole Earth up, with radiation, and makes the surface unlivable, well, we gotta have one too!
[00:36:20.511 --> 00:36:24.952]  I mean, Mr. President, we cannot allow a mineshaft gap!
[00:36:25.412 --> 00:36:25.772]  Here it is.
[00:36:28.874 --> 00:36:30.395]  Human chimeras living among us.
[00:36:30.475 --> 00:36:32.117]  It's only science fiction for right now.
[00:36:32.677 --> 00:36:42.545]  Yesterday, the Senate passed the Endless Frontier Act, a bill that commits nearly $250 billion to promote emerging technologies so that America can keep pace with Chinese innovation.
[00:36:42.945 --> 00:36:47.629]  Back in May, Democrats shot down an important amendment outlawing U.S.
[00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:51.432]  participation in research that would create human-animal hybrids.
[00:36:51.972 --> 00:36:53.073]  Also known as chimeras.
[00:36:53.453 --> 00:36:54.754]  China's already doing it.
[00:36:55.234 --> 00:37:03.200]  Announcing in April that an international team successfully grew human monkey embryos and sustained them for 20 days in a lab.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.402]  The only question is, what will they do next?
[00:37:06.842 --> 00:37:12.366]  Chimeric research is a Pandora's box, that's obviously from hell, that should not be opened.
[00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:17.469]  But the scientific community, spurred on by their own hubris, may very well open it!
[00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:19.731]  Using American taxpayer dollars.
[00:37:20.814 --> 00:37:21.875]  Now they already opened it.
[00:37:23.417 --> 00:37:40.738]  You know I covered, four days ago on the show, a stack of EU, UN, and Spanish government documents admitting that they're spraying the atmosphere to manipulate the weather on a global scale, but also spraying pesticides on us, biocides to quote, stop COVID.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.381]  Spring poison on you to stop COVID.
[00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:44.061]  It's all made up.
[00:37:44.362 --> 00:37:45.983]  It's their pretext to spray poison on you.
[00:37:46.323 --> 00:37:47.284]  This is happening.
[00:37:48.044 --> 00:37:54.648]  The actuaries show in insurance companies, 40 plus percent increase in death, 18 to 64 working age.
[00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:56.450]  The other numbers are off the chart.
[00:37:59.872 --> 00:38:07.157]  The COVID vaccines, after their introduction, has caused a shocking rise in permanent disabilities.
[00:38:07.697 --> 00:38:08.478]  We're being killed.
[00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:09.518]  We're being exterminated.
[00:38:09.879 --> 00:38:11.580]  And they're just normalizing it.
[00:38:12.674 --> 00:38:14.214]  I'm like, hey, just go watch a movie.
[00:38:14.715 --> 00:38:16.975]  Go watch a show.
[00:38:17.355 --> 00:38:18.356]  Just go back to sleep.
[00:38:20.376 --> 00:38:22.097]  So he's been on the show before.
[00:38:22.117 --> 00:38:23.797]  He'll be back on this week.
[00:38:24.357 --> 00:38:26.818]  We've got John Stein, who's also there, coming up next hour.
[00:38:26.838 --> 00:38:35.601]  But John Doyle confronts parents outside Children's Drag Queen Show at a gay strip club where Children's Youngest Five are being brought in.
[00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:37.901]  We'll show you some of that footage next hour.
[00:38:37.941 --> 00:38:40.002]  But here he is confronting them out front.
[00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:43.411]  I only have one question.
[00:38:43.993 --> 00:38:47.145]  Why do you want to put an axe wound in between your son's legs?
[00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:50.656]  Yes, we are.
[00:38:50.676 --> 00:38:51.397]  What do you mean?
[00:38:51.437 --> 00:38:52.958]  You're making America worse.
[00:38:52.998 --> 00:38:57.321]  You're bringing your children to this event.
[00:38:57.341 --> 00:38:58.282]  We need to go now.
[00:38:58.322 --> 00:38:59.663]  We'll pray for you, sweetie.
[00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:00.543]  We'll pray for you.
[00:39:00.383 --> 00:39:03.023]  Yes, we are. What do you mean? You're making America worse.
[00:39:03.023 --> 00:39:05.383]  You're bringing your children to this event.
[00:39:05.383 --> 00:39:06.383]  We need to go now.
[00:39:06.383 --> 00:39:08.383]  You're literally someone better.
[00:39:08.383 --> 00:39:10.383]  We'll pray for you, sweetie.
[00:39:10.383 --> 00:39:12.383]  We'll pray for you.
[00:39:12.383 --> 00:39:14.383]  You must repent.
[00:39:14.383 --> 00:39:16.383]  Yes, you may. Please.
[00:39:16.383 --> 00:39:18.383]  You're in a cult.
[00:39:18.383 --> 00:39:20.383]  I'm in a cult.
[00:39:20.383 --> 00:39:22.383]  Says the man in the press.
[00:39:22.383 --> 00:39:28.533]   I wonder if the mama bear instinct is going to come out in three years when the mainstream Democrat party platformers,
[00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:29.383]  they want to rape your kids.
[00:39:29.383 --> 00:39:30.922]  Oh.
[00:39:31.087 --> 00:39:35.089]  And they're all gonna think it's one big, smug little joke, these people, by the way.
[00:39:35.469 --> 00:39:46.895]  Understand that there is a bigger difference between ten years ago and now than there would be between now and in five years when they're openly advocating for pedophilia like they've already started doing.
[00:39:47.235 --> 00:39:50.897]  You people are the symptom of a dying society, and you know it.
[00:39:50.937 --> 00:39:52.258]  You're scaring children!
[00:39:52.318 --> 00:39:53.719]  Shut the fuck up!
[00:39:58.683 --> 00:39:59.003]  Shame on you!
[00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:00.104]  Shame on you!
[00:40:00.725 --> 00:40:00.985]  Shame on you!
[00:40:01.525 --> 00:40:01.846]  Shame on you!
[00:40:03.227 --> 00:40:03.627]  Shame on you!
[00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:04.628]  Shame on you!
[00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:05.629]  Shame on you!
[00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.770]  Shame on you!
[00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.791]  Shame on you!
[00:40:08.671 --> 00:40:09.172]  Shame on you!
[00:40:09.792 --> 00:40:10.173]  Shame on you!
[00:40:10.973 --> 00:40:11.314]  Shame on you!
[00:40:12.555 --> 00:40:12.875]  Shame on you!
[00:40:13.576 --> 00:40:13.856]  Shame on you!
[00:40:15.878 --> 00:40:16.138]  Shame on you!
[00:40:16.698 --> 00:40:16.998]  Shame on you!
[00:40:17.659 --> 00:40:18.580]  Shame on you!
[00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:20.201]  Shame on you!
[00:40:21.402 --> 00:40:21.783]  Shame on you!
[00:40:21.803 --> 00:40:22.223]  Shame on you!
[00:40:23.208 --> 00:40:24.388]  And we got the footage coming up.
[00:40:24.709 --> 00:40:26.309]  They do this all over the country, all over the world.
[00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:37.233]  This is corporately funded to destroy their innocence and to normalize the sexualization of children, to destroy their future and make sure they don't get a wife or a husband and have a family.
[00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:38.693]  This is hate.
[00:40:39.213 --> 00:40:40.274]  This is bullying.
[00:40:40.634 --> 00:40:45.155]  This is child abuse on steroids with the gravy of PCP.
[00:40:46.476 --> 00:40:49.477]  And they drag these poor children in like zombies.
[00:40:50.526 --> 00:40:58.908]  To stand around and be in the middle of this and have them go up and give money to big fat men dressed like clowns as they dance.
[00:40:59.589 --> 00:41:03.830]  Because the servants of Satan have been promised the children.
[00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.250]  I mean, look at this.
[00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:20.029]   Taking children that don't have their free will yet, putting them in a position like that, green-lighting them, fast-tracking them like Anderson Cooper's mother did to his brother, and he right into this.
[00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:21.911]  They did the same thing with their boys.
[00:41:22.471 --> 00:41:24.313]  One son committed suicide over it.
[00:41:25.294 --> 00:41:27.996]  And the other one conformed and took to it.
[00:41:28.596 --> 00:41:30.118]  And that's what this is.
[00:41:31.999 --> 00:41:34.141]  Man, two years, three years ago, it's gay marriage.
[00:41:34.201 --> 00:41:34.982]  All we want is gay marriage.
[00:41:35.022 --> 00:41:37.644]  Now it's, we want your children, we want them now.
[00:41:38.766 --> 00:41:45.529]  This is pedophilia writ large in a corrupt, decadent society that can't get excited about anything anymore.
[00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.891]  Not about a sunset, not about a man and woman, no, none of that.
[00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:58.476]  It's all about we've got children as a trophy and we're going to come in the schools and we're going to indoctrinate them and the corporations on the cereal boxes.
[00:41:59.758 --> 00:42:03.141]  And the pizza boxes and the toy boxes are all going to do this.
[00:42:03.461 --> 00:42:11.267]  And the answer is, I'll never eat... I don't eat all that General Mills high fructose corn syrup stuff anyways.
[00:42:12.728 --> 00:42:19.096]  And I haven't probably ordered a Pizza Hut in years, but I will never order from Pizza Hut.
[00:42:19.376 --> 00:42:19.957]  You shouldn't.
[00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:22.360]  All these big corporations are out to get you, folks.
[00:42:22.821 --> 00:42:25.504]  Unless it's like Goya Foods or something who's speaking out.
[00:42:26.025 --> 00:42:30.750]  You need to check everybody you buy stuff from and make sure they're not coming after kids.
[00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:37.354]  But the whole big corporate world is coming down on our children because they're the future.
[00:42:37.674 --> 00:42:43.059]  And if they can get them, and they can screw them up, they can do anything they want.
[00:42:44.901 --> 00:42:46.061]  So roll your own dough.
[00:42:46.361 --> 00:42:47.242]  Make your own pizza.
[00:42:47.442 --> 00:42:50.342]  Hell, Bill Gates says you won't be getting meat anyway soon.
[00:42:50.862 --> 00:42:53.563]  They're gonna take everything away from you.
[00:42:53.863 --> 00:43:02.085]  And if you'll accept a five-year-old being brought to a homosexual bar with men dancing around in front of them, you will accept human-animal hybrids.
[00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:03.505]  You will accept clones.
[00:43:03.845 --> 00:43:05.086]  You will accept GMOs.
[00:43:05.386 --> 00:43:07.006]  You will accept forced inoculations.
[00:43:07.306 --> 00:43:08.887]  You will accept the takeover of your body.
[00:43:09.167 --> 00:43:19.035]   And these clowns Are just the useful idiot vanguard of the system to totally scramble everybody's brain to accept anything going in the future.
[00:43:20.476 --> 00:43:22.939]  All right, Alex Stein, who was at this event in Dallas.
[00:43:22.959 --> 00:43:23.739]  These are happening everywhere.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.641]  We'll join us the first 30 minutes of next hour.
[00:43:25.962 --> 00:43:27.043]  I'm behind, but it's okay.
[00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:33.821]  And we're going to get into the top 10 creepiest and most dystopian things pushed by the World Economic Forum.
[00:43:34.141 --> 00:43:35.322]  That's on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:35.662 --> 00:43:37.363]  The Bilderberg Group meeting that just happened.
[00:43:38.603 --> 00:43:41.165]  Putin threatening nuclear war, but this is very serious.
[00:43:41.205 --> 00:43:42.105]  People are just ignoring it.
[00:43:42.725 --> 00:43:43.966]  What's happening to the economy.
[00:43:44.886 --> 00:43:49.429]  The latest COVID news and so much more in our number two now.
[00:43:50.229 --> 00:43:51.269]  Override the censors.
[00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.190]  Take the videos.
[00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:52.850]  Take the links.
[00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.171]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:43:55.712 --> 00:43:56.452]  Fan.video.
[00:43:58.277 --> 00:43:59.357]  Take the links, share them.
[00:44:00.238 --> 00:44:05.819]  That's how you override these tyrants that believe because they've got the corporate money and the power of Satan they rule us.
[00:44:05.919 --> 00:44:07.700]  No, you're losers, you will fail.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.920]  Hour 2 coming up.
[00:44:11.801 --> 00:44:15.762]  He just confronted, he just confronted the major groomer operation.
[00:44:16.342 --> 00:44:17.802]  Alex Stein's coming up.
[00:44:17.882 --> 00:44:20.543]  But first, it's so important, I'm gonna play it again.
[00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:21.964]  Satanism demystified.
[00:44:22.004 --> 00:44:22.584]  Stay with us.
[00:44:23.904 --> 00:44:24.704]  InfoWars.
[00:44:25.044 --> 00:44:26.565]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:44:27.628 --> 00:44:32.573]  There are many preconceived notions about what defines Satanism.
[00:44:33.174 --> 00:44:36.977]  Some people will say that Satanists are just playing dress-up.
[00:44:37.478 --> 00:44:39.620]  Some say they sacrifice children.
[00:44:40.021 --> 00:44:42.503]  And others believe they have magical powers.
[00:44:43.204 --> 00:44:45.066]  But the truth is much more simple.
[00:44:45.866 --> 00:44:50.271]  Most people will agree that Satanism is the antithesis of Christianity.
[00:44:50.812 --> 00:44:53.855]  So first we must define what Christianity is.
[00:44:54.396 --> 00:45:00.863]  In a sentence, Christianity is the impulse to express brotherly love towards our fellow man.
[00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:05.075]  Satanism does not have that impulse at all.
[00:45:05.556 --> 00:45:12.225]  In the most simple terms, Satanism can be described with the pop culture phrase, pimps and hoes.
[00:45:13.286 --> 00:45:15.489]  If these words upset you, good.
[00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:18.233]  We are talking about the nature of evil.
[00:45:18.974 --> 00:45:21.275]  And if it makes light of it, even better.
[00:45:21.756 --> 00:45:23.757]  These animals are nothing to fear.
[00:45:24.457 --> 00:45:32.001]  While the rich and powerful Satanists want you to believe they are witches and warlocks, they are nothing more than pimps and hoes.
[00:45:32.621 --> 00:45:33.081]  Cannibals.
[00:45:33.642 --> 00:45:36.543]  Feeding off other people like predatory animals.
[00:45:36.963 --> 00:45:40.165]  Completely devoid of the impulse for brotherly love.
[00:45:40.545 --> 00:45:43.867]  Satanism is base-level animal tribalism.
[00:45:44.267 --> 00:45:52.493]   An animal hierarchy comprised of the pimps at the top The hoes they control, and the tricks they both exploit.
[00:45:53.554 --> 00:45:56.997]  This is the law of the jungle, which has existed for millennia.
[00:45:57.898 --> 00:46:04.244]  A survival of the fittest, dog-eat-dog world, where the nice guys always finish last.
[00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:19.704]  It is the patriarchy that the anti-Christians claim to oppose, which makes no sense, because we are only able to transcend this ruthlessness with the Christian impulse of brotherly love, where everyone is equally welcome.
[00:46:20.766 --> 00:46:29.757]  There is much talk about a battle being waged between good and evil, but this sort of simple black and white duality only exists in our mind.
[00:46:30.177 --> 00:46:35.884]  In reality, what's going on is a balancing act between our spirit and our body.
[00:46:36.605 --> 00:46:45.191]  While our spirit may be drawn to love and light, our body is an animal with innate animal instincts that cannot easily be suppressed.
[00:46:45.912 --> 00:46:51.976]  And like every other species of animal, the primary instincts are survival and reproduction.
[00:46:52.857 --> 00:46:57.800]  So as far as mammals go, the female is the ultimate prize in the game of life.
[00:46:58.761 --> 00:47:05.567]  A society built upon a Christian ethos of brotherly love is one that honors individual freedom.
[00:47:06.047 --> 00:47:15.394]  And the way to satisfy our animal desires for survival with brotherly love is through marriage and raising a family with some degree of selflessness.
[00:47:16.599 --> 00:47:28.968]  And without the Christian ethos of brotherly love, the Satanist simply sees women as the most valued commodity to be bought and sold for one's own selfish desire, pimps and hoes.
[00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:35.874]   Whether it be in the poorest communities or at the top of the pyramid, Satanism is all about control.
[00:47:36.494 --> 00:47:42.119]  And the ones at the top have invested everything into their technocratic pop culture media machine.
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.661]  Which is their main method of pimping.
[00:47:45.082 --> 00:47:47.984]  And they see the brainwashed masses as their hoes.
[00:47:48.505 --> 00:47:51.467]  Because according to the laws of the jungle, they own them.
[00:47:52.068 --> 00:47:54.390]  Which is why they resent the Christian ethos.
[00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.913]  Because it is the only thing on earth that stands against them.
[00:47:58.973 --> 00:48:05.955]  But the real problem with Satanism is that it keeps an individual from knowing God and discovering their true path.
[00:48:06.435 --> 00:48:18.918]  Our free will allows us the choice to either transcend spiritually, which requires a personal relationship with God, or descend into the animal kingdom and forever remain a beast.
[00:48:20.098 --> 00:48:24.603]  Which is what the pimps and hoes are ultimately selling, but we don't have to buy it.
[00:48:25.244 --> 00:48:29.489]  Satanic influence has always been with us, and it is nothing to fear.
[00:48:30.169 --> 00:48:33.013]  These Satanist pimps are not gods.
[00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:37.297]  They are merely animals playing mind tricks and spinning lies.
[00:48:38.258 --> 00:48:41.779]  Redemption is for everyone, and humanity has a choice.
[00:48:42.459 --> 00:48:55.103]  We can either submit to the beast system and live like animals, or we can follow the Christian impulse for brotherly love and stand up against evil, so that our children will know freedom.
[00:48:56.884 --> 00:48:59.365]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:48:59.985 --> 00:49:00.885]  Please share the report.
[00:49:00.905 --> 00:49:02.946]  It's a banned-out video on InfoWars.com.
[00:49:03.406 --> 00:49:05.847]  Alex Stein confronted the evil just yesterday.
[00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:14.467]  day. Stay with us.
[00:49:14.421 --> 00:49:15.863]  We're in hour number two.
[00:49:16.204 --> 00:49:18.427]  And the people are fighting back!
[00:49:19.108 --> 00:49:20.129]  Alex Stein, coming up.
[00:49:24.235 --> 00:49:28.235]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:28.235 --> 00:49:35.235]  [music]
[00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.432]  We're asking you to leave.
[00:49:39.193 --> 00:49:40.915]  You're denying me entry!
[00:49:40.935 --> 00:49:42.036]  They're being bigoted!
[00:49:42.056 --> 00:49:43.137]  They're bigoted!
[00:49:43.177 --> 00:49:45.039]  They're not letting me in here!
[00:49:45.059 --> 00:49:47.121]  I can't believe they're not letting me in a gay bar!
[00:49:47.141 --> 00:49:48.742]  I thought you guys were inclusives, right?
[00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:51.885]  Are you guys trying to be inclusive?
[00:49:51.905 --> 00:49:54.187]  They're not letting me in the game floor!
[00:49:54.227 --> 00:49:55.868]  Look how inclusive this is!
[00:49:55.909 --> 00:49:58.311]  Look how inclusive they are here!
[00:49:58.571 --> 00:50:04.215]  In a moment, the camera gets cut off while all these ghouls are hitting him.
[00:50:04.296 --> 00:50:06.017]  I'm going to ask what happened to him after.
[00:50:07.158 --> 00:50:08.059]  We see fists flying.
[00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:09.740]  Hey, you're on the clock.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.521]  You gotta go.
[00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:21.341]  [CROSSTALK]
[00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:31.341]  [CROSSTALK]
[00:50:31.496 --> 00:50:33.017]  You guys don't think that's weird?
[00:50:33.037 --> 00:50:37.401]  Trying to dance with a bunch of children.
[00:50:37.501 --> 00:50:44.501]   All right, all right, we gotta go. We gotta lock this door. We gotta lock this door. We're
[00:50:44.501 --> 00:50:52.501]   gonna lock this door. All right, you're out. I wanna go out here with this. We're gonna
[00:50:52.501 --> 00:50:54.501]  lock this door. You're gonna lock it? Yeah.
[00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:55.501]  All right.
[00:50:55.735 --> 00:50:57.116]  They want access to your children.
[00:50:57.496 --> 00:51:05.735]   Many of the attendees who were pro-grooming said they're teachers or becoming teachers.
[00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:08.195]  They want access to your children.
[00:51:08.195 --> 00:51:12.276]  They have a real hunger for them.
[00:51:12.276 --> 00:51:16.976]  Alex Stein is well known for his political commentary.
[00:51:16.976 --> 00:51:19.014]  And more, he's up in Dallas.
[00:51:19.014 --> 00:51:21.296]  This is happening all over the world, corporately backed.
[00:51:21.296 --> 00:51:25.936]   And while he's with us, TV viewers will see a better angle of the assault that happened
[00:51:25.936 --> 00:51:27.335]  on him.
[00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:31.535]  Just incredible to see this continuing to unfold.
[00:51:31.535 --> 00:51:32.894]  Alex Stein, thank you for joining us.
[00:51:32.894 --> 00:51:34.976]  Tell us where this was and what was happening.
[00:51:34.976 --> 00:51:44.976]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:37.351]  Well Alex, it's always a pleasure.
[00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:38.552]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:51:38.592 --> 00:51:42.376]  So this was in Cedar Springs, what they call the gayborhood of Dallas.
[00:51:42.417 --> 00:51:45.520]  I know you know Dallas pretty well.
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:47.923]  People don't realize that Dallas has a big gay community.
[00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:51.768]  I think it's like LA, San Francisco, and Dallas is kind of on that.
[00:51:52.348 --> 00:51:53.730]  Gay radar, I guess you'd say.
[00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.895]  And listen, I want to start off by saying, I don't have any problem really with gay and trans people.
[00:51:57.915 --> 00:52:05.744]  I mean, they're not necessarily, their mental health probably isn't the best state, and a lot of them have probably been sexually abused as a child, so I'm probably empathetic to a lot of them.
[00:52:06.184 --> 00:52:08.287]  So I just want to start off by saying, I really don't have any problem.
[00:52:08.327 --> 00:52:12.832]  If they want to do a drag queen dance-off, but I don't want kids involved.
[00:52:12.912 --> 00:52:15.774]  The fact that they're trying to groom these kids and get them in there, Alex.
[00:52:16.054 --> 00:52:18.235]  Listen, it's very similar to the drug culture.
[00:52:18.255 --> 00:52:21.277]  There's a saying in the drug world, they say your first time is always free.
[00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:23.098]  That was the vibes that I got.
[00:52:23.138 --> 00:52:24.699]  And I'm an edgy person myself.
[00:52:24.739 --> 00:52:26.280]  Like, not a lot of stuff shocks me.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:35.385]  And I was shocked because the way that they were preying on these kids, the way that they were feasting on them, they were literally like feasting on them as if they were feasting on their souls.
[00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:37.747]  And I was just watching the report by Greg Reese.
[00:52:37.767 --> 00:52:39.888]  He does great work, you know, before the break.
[00:52:40.328 --> 00:52:44.069]  And it literally is some sort of demonic possession.
[00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:51.411]  These people have disassociated themselves from God, totally, and that they've sold their soul, probably because of past prior abuse.
[00:52:51.732 --> 00:52:53.972]  And what they want to do is they want to pay that forward.
[00:52:54.252 --> 00:52:56.613]  They want to bring them into their miserable life.
[00:52:56.653 --> 00:52:59.594]  They want to bring that miserious company, the famous cliché.
[00:53:00.214 --> 00:53:02.895]  It was never more real in my life.
[00:53:02.915 --> 00:53:06.616]  Statistically, these people have the highest level of suicide, the highest level of everything.
[00:53:06.676 --> 00:53:09.697]  I mean, these are captives of Satan, and now they want children.
[00:53:10.973 --> 00:53:12.255]  Well, that's what I'm saying, Alex.
[00:53:12.595 --> 00:53:15.980]  The fact that they were so happy to get these kids in there, they were so happy.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.144]  And then what was so weird is the door, they have a glass door normally.
[00:53:19.424 --> 00:53:21.247]  They put paper over the glass door.
[00:53:21.627 --> 00:53:25.212]  Oh, kind of like it was Pennsylvania or Michigan or Georgia at the voting.
[00:53:26.153 --> 00:53:27.414]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:53:27.554 --> 00:53:28.775]  Exactly like that.
[00:53:28.795 --> 00:53:30.016]  They probably used their playbook.
[00:53:30.437 --> 00:53:40.125]  And listen, at least with a drag queen story time in a library in Houston, a 32-year-old convicted sexual offender just did a drag queen story time.
[00:53:40.165 --> 00:53:41.826]  They should pull that up in Houston, Texas.
[00:53:42.087 --> 00:53:42.887]  Now, that's terrible.
[00:53:43.167 --> 00:53:44.749]  But that's at least at a public library.
[00:53:45.029 --> 00:53:46.270]  This was at a bar, Alex.
[00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:48.512]  And again, for many of our listeners, you're not having to see this.
[00:53:49.012 --> 00:53:57.838]   We have men dressed as women with 3 and 4 and 5 and 6-year-old kids giving them money Yes, and obviously we know what that means.
[00:53:57.858 --> 00:53:59.679]  They're not talking about food.
[00:53:59.799 --> 00:54:01.159]  And this is the problem, Alex, too.
[00:54:01.219 --> 00:54:02.679]  It's the denuclearization of the family.
[00:54:02.499 --> 00:54:06.979]   behind it saying it's not gonna lick itself. Yes and obviously we know what
[00:54:06.979 --> 00:54:10.298]   that means they're not talking about food and this is the problem Alex - it's
[00:54:10.298 --> 00:54:12.909]  the denuclearization of the family that's what's so bad.
[00:54:12.909 --> 00:54:19.819]   And they parade the children around like trophies. Yeah Alex you just nailed it.
[00:54:17.896 --> 00:54:18.696]  They were trophies.
[00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:20.417]  You know how you want a trophy wife?
[00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:25.759]  These are like trophy kids because when we went and confronted the people when they came out, Alex, all the moms were single moms.
[00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:26.579]  They were with an aunt.
[00:54:26.819 --> 00:54:32.781]  I didn't see one dad that you would say a normal dad, a dad that looks like you, you know, that would wear the khaki shorts and a t-shirt.
[00:54:33.161 --> 00:54:36.742]  Everybody was a single parent and it was a lot of people of color.
[00:54:36.762 --> 00:54:41.124]  Let's say the parents all look like mutants, like a giant satanic spider shucked their soul.
[00:54:42.265 --> 00:54:56.208]  And so I have intel, some of the people that did get in, of course they recognized me immediately, but they said there was kids that were trying to play on their Nintendo DS, their little video game thing, I'm not a video gamer, and that the parents took the video games out of their hands and said, pay attention to the drag race.
[00:54:56.668 --> 00:54:57.268]  What is that?
[00:54:57.308 --> 00:55:06.750]  What kind of world do we live in, Alex, where a kid doesn't even want to be there, wants to play on his video games, that's bad enough, but the parent says, no, look, look at the stripper dance, look at the person dance.
[00:55:06.790 --> 00:55:08.690]  This is total, total recruitment.
[00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:11.754]  And then bullying, and it's going on in the schools.
[00:55:12.155 --> 00:55:15.099]  It's going on in Pizza Hut and Disney.
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:17.764]  I mean, this is a full globalist assault.
[00:55:18.164 --> 00:55:19.026]  This is their assault.
[00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:23.493]  And Alex, this is the problem, so I'll send a photo to your producer too.
[00:55:23.533 --> 00:55:27.075]  So Andy Ngo did some great journalism by finding out who all these people were.
[00:55:27.355 --> 00:55:44.445]  That was my next question, because I'm not trying to give us credit because it's below the radar, but we've sent out PIs before and others in Houston and other places, running the plates of these people, and a bunch of their events got shut down by us and others because they're convicted pedophiles.
[00:55:44.745 --> 00:55:46.866]  So no wonder some of them are wearing masks.
[00:55:47.206 --> 00:55:48.127]  Who knows what's going to come out?
[00:55:49.161 --> 00:55:50.202]  Well, of course, they have to hide.
[00:55:50.262 --> 00:55:53.224]  And then somebody already told me one of them is a volleyball coach.
[00:55:53.284 --> 00:55:58.127]  One of the people there is a volleyball coach at Richardson High School, which is a prominent high school in a nice neighborhood.
[00:55:58.488 --> 00:56:04.432]  But what I'm trying to say is, on one of the things, I need to pull up the picture, the drag queen's name, I believe, was Noelle.
[00:56:04.552 --> 00:56:11.117]  And they posted, they went back on their Instagram, and then Noelle talked about, in full drag, in downtown Dallas, said, want to get pizza.
[00:56:11.537 --> 00:56:15.118]  So this is the problem, is the mainstream media is going to say, oh, Pizzagate is fake!
[00:56:15.198 --> 00:56:20.120]  It's a debunked conspiracy theory of a bunch of people having a child sex ring at a pizza parlor.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:20.840]  False.
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.080]  That's not what we believe.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:28.062]  What we know is that we have people, John Podesta, sending weird emails talking about maps, minor attracted persons.
[00:56:28.082 --> 00:56:29.002]  There's so much evidence.
[00:56:29.022 --> 00:56:33.344]  We got Bill Clinton on the Lolita Express 26 times with no secret service.
[00:56:33.364 --> 00:56:44.555]   This is the facts that we have, that we're hanging out with Prince Andrew, the queen The FBI manuals say they use pizza as the code word for having sex with children.
[00:56:45.636 --> 00:56:48.420]  Surprise, surprise, that's being promoted here.
[00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:54.894]  Yeah, and listen, this is not, we talk about conspiracy all the time, but this is being done out in the open.
[00:56:54.914 --> 00:56:56.455]  This is in Dallas, Texas.
[00:56:56.475 --> 00:56:57.376]  What do you make of it?
[00:56:57.396 --> 00:56:58.256]  We've got plenty of time.
[00:56:58.276 --> 00:57:04.982]  We're going to go over it all, Alex, but even Bill Maher says leave the kids alone and this drag queen stuff, targeting kids, is out of control.
[00:57:05.022 --> 00:57:09.185]  I mean, are people really going to, liberals, are you really going to sign on to this?
[00:57:10.595 --> 00:57:14.758]  Well, you know, I have gay friends and family members that have reached out and they said, hey, this is too far.
[00:57:14.778 --> 00:57:16.240]  Why are they sexualizing children?
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:21.964]  But Alex, you know, and I know this is their target because in the gay community, they can't procreate.
[00:57:22.224 --> 00:57:24.046]  So they have to recruit people.
[00:57:24.086 --> 00:57:25.387]  They have to recruit children.
[00:57:25.707 --> 00:57:26.608]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:57:26.628 --> 00:57:27.489]  This is a recruitment.
[00:57:27.509 --> 00:57:29.410]  This is like, oh, this is your first time free.
[00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.592]  Because, like, imagine your first rock concert.
[00:57:31.632 --> 00:57:32.573]  I remember like it was yesterday.
[00:57:32.673 --> 00:57:33.373]  Oh, it was so fun.
[00:57:33.774 --> 00:57:34.674]  This is what they're trying to do.
[00:57:35.155 --> 00:57:36.996]  They're trying to take them to a bar for an adult.
[00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:39.118]  You're trying to convert them into a lifestyle.
[00:57:39.969 --> 00:57:41.710]  Yes, and I'm saying a bar is a fun place.
[00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.991]  I remember with the college, when I first went to a bar, I was like, oh, this is so much fun.
[00:57:45.031 --> 00:57:46.512]  I get to drink, I get to hang out.
[00:57:46.752 --> 00:57:48.833]  But they're trying to sexualize children in a gay bar.
[00:57:48.853 --> 00:57:50.093]  This has gone too far.
[00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:57.036]  They're trying to make something that is cool, something that is a part of American culture, going to a bar, having a beer, and grooming little children.
[00:57:57.136 --> 00:57:59.237]  And the entire corporate system is behind it.
[00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:02.141]  And Alex, you talk about the corporate system.
[00:58:02.281 --> 00:58:05.124]  Every single June 1st, they all put their gay flag.
[00:58:05.364 --> 00:58:09.147]  But in that same corporation, BMW doesn't have a gay flag in Saudi Arabia.
[00:58:09.488 --> 00:58:11.910]  Apple Computer doesn't have a gay flag in Saudi Arabia.
[00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:14.452]  So these multinational corporations are the biggest hypocrites.
[00:58:14.713 --> 00:58:15.734]  And that's the biggest problem.
[00:58:15.774 --> 00:58:18.216]  Now George Carlin, you know, some of his politics I didn't agree with.
[00:58:18.436 --> 00:58:20.796]  But that's the problem, is Americans are idiots.
[00:58:20.836 --> 00:58:25.077]  And I hate to say that, but all we care about is these stupid corporations and what they say.
[00:58:25.117 --> 00:58:26.277]  They dictate our happiness.
[00:58:26.398 --> 00:58:30.778]  Oh, if I don't have the newest car, if I don't have the newest cell phone, if I don't have the newest blah, blah, blah.
[00:58:30.978 --> 00:58:35.239]  It's all inanimate bullcrap from corporations that literally just want you to consume.
[00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:44.521]  And sadly, most Americans, I would say 95% of Americans, fall into the trap of pure consumption until there's nothing left and their soul is just given to some corporation.
[00:58:44.841 --> 00:58:46.222]  And then finally, they just want the children.
[00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.284]  I mean, look, it took over the Catholic Church.
[00:58:48.364 --> 00:58:49.545]  It took over the Boy Scouts.
[00:58:49.985 --> 00:58:52.848]  They're using sex operatives to take over.
[00:58:52.888 --> 00:59:01.235]  Then institutions cover up the sex abuse, and now the intel operatives, through their vanguard of the clown men dressed as women, take over.
[00:59:01.495 --> 00:59:02.276]  That's all this is.
[00:59:02.156 --> 00:59:14.476]  pedophiles dressed as clowns.
[00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:15.761]  This is Live Sunday Edition.
[00:59:15.801 --> 00:59:20.086]  Owen Schroer coming up in T-minus 40 minutes with Sunday Live 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:59:21.047 --> 00:59:22.129]  Alex, I'm just like you.
[00:59:22.149 --> 00:59:25.112]  I don't hate anybody if they're an adult.
[00:59:26.034 --> 00:59:27.095]  I'm not judging people.
[00:59:27.155 --> 00:59:27.976]  I'm not a Pharisee.
[00:59:29.079 --> 00:59:30.319]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:33.180]  We all preface, oh, we don't hate people.
[00:59:33.781 --> 00:59:38.442]  I don't care if they're homosexual or heterosexual, whoever they are, leave kids alone.
[00:59:38.502 --> 00:59:48.146]  There is a corporate targeting of children in their sexual lives, something parents don't talk to their children about until they're 10, 11, 12 years old.
[00:59:48.666 --> 00:59:49.666]  It is pedophilia.
[00:59:50.046 --> 00:59:50.787]  It is evil.
[00:59:51.187 --> 00:59:51.887]  It is sick.
[00:59:52.027 --> 00:59:53.728]  It is behavioral psychology.
[00:59:54.668 --> 01:00:00.737]  CIA mind control, MKUltra was all about sex and kids, BF Skinner, all of it.
[01:00:01.438 --> 01:00:06.765]  It needs to be rejected totally and we have to say no to it.
[01:00:06.805 --> 01:00:08.407]  So you were there at this facility.
[01:00:09.817 --> 01:00:12.641]  It's got national attention, but it's going on everywhere.
[01:00:13.001 --> 01:00:13.962]  What else did you observe?
[01:00:14.002 --> 01:00:18.508]  You had this photo you sent us of one of these individuals that says they want to be in education.
[01:00:19.288 --> 01:00:20.490]  They want access to your children.
[01:00:21.331 --> 01:00:22.112]  That's what's happening.
[01:00:22.392 --> 01:00:24.314]  So when you turn your children over to these people...
[01:00:25.293 --> 01:00:27.234]  It's now confirmed, by the way, the police lied.
[01:00:27.274 --> 01:00:28.234]  I'm so ashamed of them.
[01:00:28.555 --> 01:00:29.995]  I'm not just here to bash the police.
[01:00:30.636 --> 01:00:40.760]  In Texas, Uvalde, worse than Sandy Hook, worse than Columbine, worse than Broward County, the stand down was 75 minutes.
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:41.801]  They weren't in the building.
[01:00:42.161 --> 01:00:51.886]  They were ordered by the head cop at the school, who's now a city council member, who won't cooperate with an investigation with the state police or anybody.
[01:00:53.126 --> 01:00:58.183]  That's coming up after you leave us, but the point is, is that the system is after our children.
[01:00:58.605 --> 01:00:59.708]  Alex Stein, please continue.
[01:01:00.805 --> 01:01:02.506]  Well, I mean, you nailed it with Uvalde.
[01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:11.490]  I mean, we can only say so much, but I mean, just the story that they tell us, the fact that they stood down for so long is insubordination, and it's just typical after 9-11.
[01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:16.352]  Somehow these guys fail miserably, and all of a sudden now it becomes a city council member that's probably going to be protected.
[01:01:16.693 --> 01:01:19.894]  And you bet your bottom dollar I'm going to be in a Uvalde City Council meeting.
[01:01:19.934 --> 01:01:26.397]  They've already canceled one meeting, but eventually they're going to have to open it up, and that police chief is going to get an earful from primetime 99 Alex 9.
[01:01:26.557 --> 01:01:29.499]  You know, I'm not speaking hyperbolically when I talk about that.
[01:01:30.379 --> 01:01:42.364]  Well Alex, you just nailed it.
[01:01:42.464 --> 01:01:45.505]  When you talk about the children, it's a lot like the Black Lives Matter movement.
[01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:50.627]  Even in their manual, they talk about the denuclearization of the family.
[01:01:50.647 --> 01:01:53.788]  They don't want a family household with the father, with the mother.
[01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:59.570]  And they say their main mission is the end of the nuclear family and making black men transgender, which is sterilize black men.
[01:02:00.842 --> 01:02:02.623]  Well, Alex, you got Kentaji Brown-Jackson.
[01:02:02.643 --> 01:02:03.623]  They said, what is a woman?
[01:02:03.683 --> 01:02:06.845]  She can't even say, boys have a penis, girls have a vagina.
[01:02:06.985 --> 01:02:09.066]  I mean, they just can't even break it down to the simple terms.
[01:02:09.306 --> 01:02:13.188]  They want your third grade teacher to dictate what your sexuality is.
[01:02:13.948 --> 01:02:17.710]  They want your third grade or first grade teacher to literally screw your kids up.
[01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.671]  And we're supposed to just stand by and let them do that.
[01:02:19.951 --> 01:02:20.852]  It's a litmus test.
[01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:28.902]  Well, and the thing is, we're failing that litmus test because most people are letting it do it because they're already busy with their bills, with their stress, or the inflation.
[01:02:28.922 --> 01:02:30.603]  People can't afford to put gas in their car.
[01:02:30.883 --> 01:02:34.685]  People are living in an absolute nightmare, so then they have to put their kids in public school.
[01:02:34.926 --> 01:02:38.487]  And you're basically, when you do that, you're putting your kid, the state is raising your kid.
[01:02:38.507 --> 01:02:40.729]  And let's just tell you this, the state does not care about you.
[01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:42.009]  People suffer from cognitive dissonance.
[01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:47.052]  When you put your child in a public school, you're putting them in a den of behavioral psychologists and pedophiles.
[01:02:48.237 --> 01:02:51.801]  Every pedophile on earth is racing towards access with children.
[01:02:52.081 --> 01:02:52.782]  That's all this is.
[01:02:53.983 --> 01:02:56.565]  Well, Alex, because these people want to be around children.
[01:02:56.605 --> 01:03:00.169]  I mean, listen, unless a kid is your own kid, most people don't want to be around kids.
[01:03:00.249 --> 01:03:00.989]  Most normal people.
[01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:02.191]  And I'm not anti-kids.
[01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:05.514]  I'm just saying people have enough with their hands over their own children.
[01:03:05.554 --> 01:03:10.579]  I mean, statistically, we know that a large percentage of these drag queen pedophile times are pedophiles.
[01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:14.381]  100%!
[01:03:11.741 --> 01:03:14.381]  In Houston, a guy that was just arrested.
[01:03:14.441 --> 01:03:16.602]  I mean, he was on the sex offender list.
[01:03:16.902 --> 01:03:18.502]  He was doing the Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:03:18.682 --> 01:03:22.863]  So these guys are actually risking going back to jail just to be able to put a kid in their lap.
[01:03:23.083 --> 01:03:24.363]  Just to be able to watch a kid.
[01:03:24.423 --> 01:03:28.164]  Just because their sexual fantasies are more important than their actual long-term goals.
[01:03:28.184 --> 01:03:29.164]  They are willing to go to jail.
[01:03:29.404 --> 01:03:30.484]  And this is the problem, Alex.
[01:03:30.804 --> 01:03:37.025]  Even in jail, if you're a child molester, you have to be in a special wing because they are going to kill you in jail if you're a child molester.
[01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:40.846]  And now these liberal mothers bring their children to sit on these people's laps.
[01:03:41.872 --> 01:03:46.194]  Yeah, but I'm just saying, even in jail, the worst place on earth, they hate child molesters.
[01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:51.057]  So these are the most hardened criminals in the world, still don't respect a child molester.
[01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.778]  These are the worst people on earth.
[01:03:52.998 --> 01:03:55.180]  And this is the problem though, Alex, it's very cyclical.
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.702]  I would guarantee the majority of these people doing this would abuse children.
[01:03:58.762 --> 01:04:04.105]  And again, the police would raid an Austin Topless bar and they brought a 16-year-old girl to it.
[01:04:05.529 --> 01:04:07.934]  I mean, if adults want to go do that, do that.
[01:04:08.435 --> 01:04:09.117]  That's your right.
[01:04:09.357 --> 01:04:14.909]  But the point is, they're bringing children to strip-tease events because it's LGBT-P.
[01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:15.550]  It's okay.
[01:04:15.830 --> 01:04:16.792]  No, it's not okay.
[01:04:17.901 --> 01:04:23.382]  Yeah, and Alex, this place didn't serve food, and now they say, oh, in Texas, there's a law, if you're with your parent, you can have a beer.
[01:04:23.582 --> 01:04:24.663]  Yeah, that's for teenagers.
[01:04:24.683 --> 01:04:26.003]  That's not for nine-year-olds.
[01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:29.864]  Yeah, if you're 16 or 15, yeah, a waiter lets you have a beer with your dad sometimes.
[01:04:30.144 --> 01:04:43.667]  But a nine-year-old, a six-year-old, toddlers inside of a bar that doesn't serve food, so there's no justification for them to even be in there, unless you want them to be part of some sort of satanic lifestyle that's grooming them for them to be socially acceptable.
[01:04:43.867 --> 01:04:47.488]  Because this is the thing, is these people know their whole culture is not socially acceptable.
[01:04:47.728 --> 01:04:49.348]  They know that it's not okay to shake their genitals in the face.
[01:04:49.388 --> 01:04:51.389]  And they're trying to take the culture over, and they're corporately backed.
[01:04:51.729 --> 01:04:53.449]  Alex Stein, tell me about this individual.
[01:04:53.769 --> 01:04:55.410]  The photo you sent us, we'll do an overhead shot.
[01:04:55.970 --> 01:05:00.471]  This individual says they want to go to school, they're going to school to be a teacher.
[01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:02.391]  Well, this is Noel.
[01:05:02.471 --> 01:05:09.112]  So I have a video, I think it's at 1.2 million views just on Twitter, and it's been shared on, you know, every single social media platform and YouTube.
[01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:15.073]  And this person right there, when I confronted them, Alex, they melted like an ice cream cone in the sunlight.
[01:05:15.133 --> 01:05:17.414]  I mean, they felt so guilty, so much shame.
[01:05:17.794 --> 01:05:20.918]  And then when you look at that photo, if they can zoom out a little bit, you'll see the caption.
[01:05:20.938 --> 01:05:22.120]  It says, want to get pizza.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.802]  So this goes back to what I was saying.
[01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.164]  These are FBI.
[01:05:25.424 --> 01:05:27.126]  This is declassified information.
[01:05:27.146 --> 01:05:31.792]  These are the secret code words that they use in order to talk about their child pedophilia.
[01:05:31.812 --> 01:05:32.854]  Pizza means children.
[01:05:33.746 --> 01:05:34.086]  Yes.
[01:05:34.326 --> 01:05:35.607]  Walnuts mean this.
[01:05:35.787 --> 01:05:37.588]  Map means minor attracted person.
[01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:39.089]  So they have to speak in code words.
[01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:40.770]  That's why they have symbols and signs.
[01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:42.971]  And it's a lot like what the people that are in power use.
[01:05:43.251 --> 01:05:46.653]  That's why they trick us and they mock us with signs and symbols.
[01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:47.814]  So we don't know what's going on.
[01:05:48.074 --> 01:05:50.175]  But they have a dog whistle and they're laughing.
[01:05:50.195 --> 01:05:51.136]  Like Klaus Schwab.
[01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.036]  These people that are in church.
[01:05:52.276 --> 01:05:53.857]  They're all laughing at us, Alex.
[01:05:54.097 --> 01:05:54.478]  That's the thing.
[01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.419]  Less than 1% of the population has 99% of the wealth.
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.062]  So we know that there is no middle class currently in America.
[01:06:02.303 --> 01:06:08.927]  So it is a destabilization making it impossible to even live and operate in a world and have happiness, to have joy.
[01:06:09.968 --> 01:06:17.033]  I remember ten years ago they were handing out condoms to five-year-olds at the Cub Scout and Boy Scout Jubilee.
[01:06:17.634 --> 01:06:20.916]  Thousands of rapes and then the left took over the Boy Scouts.
[01:06:21.376 --> 01:06:23.038]  This is how they took over the Catholic Church.
[01:06:23.358 --> 01:06:25.960]  It's how they take over the Boy Scouts, how they take over universities.
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.441]  This is a sex cult.
[01:06:28.703 --> 01:06:30.785]  And Alex, the social media is the big problem.
[01:06:30.805 --> 01:06:33.488]  Because when you and I were in school, we didn't have our teacher's Facebook group.
[01:06:33.508 --> 01:06:35.230]  We didn't know about our teacher's gay cruise.
[01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:37.772]  We didn't know about our teacher's boyfriend.
[01:06:37.873 --> 01:06:40.315]  When I left school at 3.30, I didn't know what my teachers did.
[01:06:40.655 --> 01:06:44.900]  But now with the social media, now everybody has their extremely online lifestyle.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:50.920]   you're able to indoctrinate these kids and they see, "Oh, you know, the teacher is, this is seems cool."
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:55.719]   So what I'm saying is these teachers have a lot of power over the youth, they have even more power now
[01:06:55.719 --> 01:06:56.920]  than they've ever had.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:02.478]   And they're using it for evil, satanic agenda in order to indoctrinate our children,
[01:07:02.478 --> 01:07:07.400]   in order to groom them so that we live in a world because I, you know, call me conspiratorial all you want.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.039]   In the future, they want us to all be one race and one sexual gender.
[01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:11.880]  How do they do that?
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:17.880]   They confuse us, they make it so we don't have love, we don't find a sex partner, we all die alone, unhappy,
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.159]  we're all gay, bisexual, like.
[01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:23.948]  They want us isolated, totally confused, programmed by them.
[01:07:24.428 --> 01:07:25.449]  It's the corporate takeover.
[01:07:25.489 --> 01:07:34.055]  We come back, Elon Musk came out and asked, why doesn't the DOJ leak, like everything else, Epstein's client list?
[01:07:34.495 --> 01:07:35.956]  Doesn't that seem odd?
[01:07:36.316 --> 01:07:37.537]  Because they're running it.
[01:07:37.877 --> 01:07:38.938]  Because they're part of it.
[01:07:39.038 --> 01:07:45.038]   and we'll expose Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein and the pedo rings and the cloning rings and
[01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:47.677]  what it's really all about with Alex Stein straight ahead.
[01:07:47.677 --> 01:08:04.798]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:05.004 --> 01:08:14.948]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:22.432]  I want something to sink in really deep on this Sunday evening, June 5th, 2022.
[01:08:22.572 --> 01:08:33.659]   Imagine 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, If you heard any of the things will be going on now, that are happening now, what would you say?
[01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:46.502]  I mean, if random groups wanted to obsess and meet with your five-year-old about their politics, you'd say, no, you're trying to take over my territory, my life, my family, our ancestors, who we are, you're trying to dominate me.
[01:08:47.222 --> 01:08:50.782]  But these are people saying, we want to teach your child, they're another gender.
[01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:58.037]   We want to take your children to a Gabor, we want to do all this.
[01:08:58.357 --> 01:09:04.143]  This is absolute evil taking place all over the world.
[01:09:04.784 --> 01:09:07.087]  It's just Alex Stein in Dallas that's confronting it.
[01:09:07.807 --> 01:09:10.090]  So Alex, please continue, my friend, with what you're laying out here.
[01:09:11.044 --> 01:09:20.873]  Well, Alex, and one thing I want to say, you know, somebody sent me some better pictures, but, you know, a lot of these people, Antifa, I'm just using that as a general term, the people that were counter-protesting us, they were caring.
[01:09:20.913 --> 01:09:45.349]   They had weapons, so I'm not trying to virtue-save, nor trying to, you know, get a pat on my back, but these people are evil, sadistic, they're probably on some sort of psychotropic drugs, they're probably all having suicidal idolization, so the fact that they have a gun out there and they're trying to counter-protest us, It is a scary place, and I'm not saying this to try to, like I said, I'm not trying to get a pat on my back, but we have to stand up before it's too late, because if we don't stand up, if we don't speak for ourselves, nobody's going to speak for us.
[01:09:45.429 --> 01:09:46.749]  Nobody's going to represent us.
[01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:49.950]  And that's the problem is these people, they're afraid of sounding homophobic.
[01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:51.511]  They're afraid of sounding bigoted.
[01:09:51.891 --> 01:09:52.571]  I'm not a bigot.
[01:09:52.851 --> 01:09:53.651]  I'm not a homophobe.
[01:09:53.871 --> 01:09:55.892]  But I am a pedophobe.
[01:09:57.057 --> 01:09:58.518]  I am a pedophobe, 100%.
[01:09:58.558 --> 01:09:59.158]  That's the problem.
[01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:01.639]  Like I was saying earlier, in prison, the chomos get killed.
[01:10:01.939 --> 01:10:05.700]  And we know, we have people like Dennis Hastert, who's Secretary of the State.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:06.961]  Convicted pedophile.
[01:10:06.981 --> 01:10:08.901]  These are people in high positions.
[01:10:08.921 --> 01:10:11.362]  You look at Kentaji Brown-Jackson, Supreme Court Justice.
[01:10:11.402 --> 01:10:15.904]  Her resume is being easy on child predators, people that have looked up child porn.
[01:10:16.224 --> 01:10:17.745]  So this is the world that we're living in.
[01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:19.665]  You just talk about a 10-year flashback.
[01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:31.930]  I mean, what's happening now, we would never, nobody could have even written this in a book, except for George Orwell, or except for Brave New World, where everybody's on somas, everybody's on antidepressants that make them more depressed.
[01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.372]  And like I said, the misery loves company.
[01:10:34.412 --> 01:10:38.795]  These people want to indoctrinate our kids and bring them into their hellhole of a life, their depression of a life.
[01:10:39.055 --> 01:10:41.156]  Because in some of the videos, I call them out.
[01:10:41.417 --> 01:10:45.139]  These people that are defending him, Alex, they have huge cut marks on their wrists and their hands.
[01:10:45.379 --> 01:10:46.480]  So they're obviously cutters.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.041]  They're self-mutilators.
[01:10:48.422 --> 01:10:52.805]  That type of person, a self-mutilator, you know, God bless him.
[01:10:53.105 --> 01:10:54.005]  I feel bad for him.
[01:10:54.025 --> 01:10:54.746]  I have empathy for him.
[01:10:54.966 --> 01:10:57.388]  But these are the people you want hanging around your children.
[01:10:58.158 --> 01:10:58.358]  No.
[01:10:58.378 --> 01:11:03.062]  We've got a bunch of people that should be in mental institutions obsessed with our children.
[01:11:03.382 --> 01:11:04.663]  This isn't rocket science.
[01:11:04.943 --> 01:11:06.584]  And they have corporate backing.
[01:11:06.644 --> 01:11:07.205]  That's the key.
[01:11:08.311 --> 01:11:10.112]  Yeah, and we have a mental health crisis.
[01:11:10.252 --> 01:11:10.952]  It's obvious.
[01:11:10.992 --> 01:11:11.632]  That's the problem.
[01:11:11.652 --> 01:11:12.873]  That's why they say the gun violence.
[01:11:12.893 --> 01:11:14.293]  Well, a gun has never shot itself.
[01:11:14.634 --> 01:11:16.094]  It's some crazy person behind it.
[01:11:16.134 --> 01:11:23.577]  So we have a system where people are literally, depending on Big Pharma, that is a multinational corporation that wants to keep you sick.
[01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:27.139]  Listen, Big Pharma is not trying to heal any of the sickness.
[01:11:27.179 --> 01:11:29.920]  And I love when they start attacking and hitting you.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.860]  For TV viewers who can see it, radio listeners can.
[01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:35.402]  The videos are all on Infowars.com and on your Twitter and other sites.
[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:39.012]  You don't punch them back, you just pull a ski mask off.
[01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:42.315]  Yeah, because I want to de-mask them, because that's what they do.
[01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:47.218]  They think that they're comfortable putting on the mask, hiding behind it, so they think that they can operate very freely.
[01:11:47.439 --> 01:11:48.239]  Well, that's not the case.
[01:11:48.279 --> 01:11:51.362]  We need to stand up and de-mask these people and expose them.
[01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:58.908]  And that's why InfoWars does a great job, because when you expose them and they have to put their name on it, it's like those keyboard warriors, Alex, that can hide behind an avatar.
[01:11:58.928 --> 01:12:00.269]  They'll say a lot of mean stuff.
[01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.809]  But they'll never say it to your face.
[01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:06.811]  Well, these people say mean stuff to your face, but they hide behind a mask because they don't want to back it up.
[01:12:06.851 --> 01:12:08.531]  They're not wearing a mask because of COVID.
[01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:12.032]  You know, they're doing it because they want to hide because they know there are going to be cameras there.
[01:12:12.072 --> 01:12:12.852]  So we have to stand up.
[01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:14.333]  We have to de-mask these people.
[01:12:14.593 --> 01:12:17.293]  And they should be held accountable for their crazy viewpoints.
[01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:22.775]  Because when I confronted that drag queen, you could see just the shame and the guilt.
[01:12:23.435 --> 01:12:31.099]  You know in their personality they knew what they did is wrong and most of these people know what they're doing is wrong But they continue to do it because they have other people cheerleading them.
[01:12:31.139 --> 01:12:32.180]  They have other evil people.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:34.141]  They're like, oh, this is good This is good.
[01:12:34.181 --> 01:12:38.663]  It only takes one person at the top to make other people do it It's like the polish.
[01:12:38.703 --> 01:12:45.667]  I know you've got so many clips and I want to get to this Can you send it to us or which clip is it where you confront?
[01:12:47.172 --> 01:12:50.812]  Yes, I'll send it to you.
[01:12:50.812 --> 01:12:52.212]  That clip is one of the best ones.
[01:12:52.212 --> 01:12:54.452]  Hold on, let me send it to her right now.
[01:12:54.452 --> 01:12:56.172]  But that's where I'm walking to the car.
[01:12:56.172 --> 01:12:57.252]  Yes, this is the one.
[01:12:57.252 --> 01:13:00.572]  So this is the person that has the "I want to get pizza."
[01:13:00.572 --> 01:13:02.572]  And you can just tell, like, they're so mad.
[01:13:02.572 --> 01:13:07.011]   They started off, you know, walking very normal, but you can just tell the guilt and the shame
[01:13:07.011 --> 01:13:08.011]  that they had.
[01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:10.452]  That's why all of a sudden they go off the handle like that.
[01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:11.452]  Because it's projection.
[01:13:11.452 --> 01:13:12.452]  They're projecting all that pain.
[01:13:12.452 --> 01:13:14.172]  Okay, so we do have the clip.
[01:13:14.172 --> 01:13:15.972]  So we're going to pause here for a moment.
[01:13:15.972 --> 01:13:18.332]  We're going to queue the clip up.
[01:13:18.332 --> 01:13:19.971]  And here is the clip.
[01:13:19.971 --> 01:13:20.971]  We're little children.
[01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:21.972]  Do you like dancing?
[01:13:21.972 --> 01:13:22.972]  We're little children.
[01:13:22.972 --> 01:13:27.972]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[01:13:27.884 --> 01:13:29.184]  Dancing around for little children.
[01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:29.924]  Get the fuck away from me!
[01:13:30.184 --> 01:13:31.425]  Don't you think that's disgusting?
[01:13:31.445 --> 01:13:33.365]  Hey, get the fuck away!
[01:13:33.425 --> 01:13:34.825]  Hey, well you can't just touch me!
[01:13:35.065 --> 01:13:36.906]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[01:13:37.066 --> 01:13:40.327]  You don't think that's disgusting?
[01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:44.187]  Dancing for little children!
[01:13:44.267 --> 01:13:47.128]  You should be ashamed of yourself dancing for little children!
[01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:49.068]  You should be ashamed of yourself!
[01:13:49.248 --> 01:13:49.948]  Is he a child?
[01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:50.389]  No!
[01:13:50.569 --> 01:13:53.009]  You guys dancing little children!
[01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:54.689]  You should be ashamed of yourselves!
[01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:55.750]  You're disgusting!
[01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:57.090]  Think about what you just did!
[01:13:58.090 --> 01:14:01.132]  Okay, that's fine, but you dance naked in front of little children.
[01:14:01.152 --> 01:14:06.494]  I mean, look at these freaks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:06.594 --> 01:14:09.155]  And they have a total desire to destroy innocence.
[01:14:09.175 --> 01:14:11.096]  Alex Stein, please continue.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.182]  I'm just saying, you can tell the guilt and shame.
[01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:16.043]  That's why they're freaking out.
[01:14:16.083 --> 01:14:17.444]  That's why they're trying to get into a car.
[01:14:17.464 --> 01:14:19.145]  See, I stand behind what I say.
[01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:21.027]  I'm willing to sit there and have a conversation.
[01:14:21.067 --> 01:14:21.567]  They aren't.
[01:14:21.808 --> 01:14:30.295]  As soon as they dance and they shake around in front of their kids and they get tipped like a stripper, they want to run through the back door and get in their car and drive off because they don't want to actually face the music.
[01:14:30.355 --> 01:14:31.696]  That's the problem in society.
[01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:38.695]  Which steals a woman's identity that a fat, ugly man or a man is a woman because they're in a clown outfit.
[01:14:38.715 --> 01:14:39.015]  They're not.
[01:14:39.335 --> 01:14:47.683]  It's it the clown comes in disguise to go and do this event and they don't want the light of day because they don't want their backgrounds checked.
[01:14:48.942 --> 01:14:53.545]  Well, Alex, all you gotta do is look at the numbers of people with gender reassignment surgeries and the trans movement.
[01:14:53.605 --> 01:14:55.907]  I mean, in the 80s, it was a very small percent.
[01:14:55.947 --> 01:14:56.587]  It was like 1%.
[01:14:56.627 --> 01:15:02.291]  Bill Maher had the best monologue about it, talking about from the 60s, it was one-tenth of 1%, then it doubled, then it doubled.
[01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:06.634]  And now you look at places, now it's like, you know, 20% of kids are trans or transitioning.
[01:15:06.674 --> 01:15:12.198]  In California, you know, there's that one, it's like one out of every- This is a sterilization death call taking over.
[01:15:13.064 --> 01:15:23.074]  But I just want to say this point, in California, it's like 1 out of every 20 kids, and I'm just saying this number for a general term, 1 out of every 20 kids is trans, but in Ohio, it's like 1 out of every 1,000.
[01:15:23.575 --> 01:15:27.459]  So what's the difference between Los Angeles and Cleveland, Ohio?
[01:15:27.779 --> 01:15:30.582]  It's because the indoctrination of the culture they're around.
[01:15:30.642 --> 01:15:35.187]  It's not because all of a sudden, oh, I'm a girl, I was born, even though I have a penis, I'm a girl.
[01:15:35.487 --> 01:15:36.407]  So this is the problem.
[01:15:36.447 --> 01:15:42.170]  It's these outside forces are the ones that are dictating and taking advantage of these children and this transgender movement.
[01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:43.270]  This isn't some new thing.
[01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.671]  I mean, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[01:15:44.691 --> 01:15:46.632]  You look at the Statue of Liberty, they say is trans.
[01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:49.233]  I mean, there's this has been a kind of a long time.
[01:15:49.533 --> 01:15:53.134]  Even Shakespeare would put the male actors in dresses and there was women there.
[01:15:53.174 --> 01:16:03.147]   So I'm just saying this is a calculated thing in order to transition people to make men boys, to make make girls guys to confuse us so we don't know what's going
[01:16:03.147 --> 01:16:03.577]  on.
[01:16:03.577 --> 01:16:07.777]   There's always been men that want to take over the place of women.
[01:16:07.777 --> 01:16:10.937]  First they tell you, "Oh there are no women, men and women."
[01:16:10.937 --> 01:16:13.257]  There's a targeting of women going on.
[01:16:13.257 --> 01:16:16.016]  There's a key report that breaks this down at Bandai Video.
[01:16:16.016 --> 01:16:18.897]  Satanism demystified.
[01:16:18.897 --> 01:16:21.457]   And sorry my dogs are going crazy, but this is all we've got to talk about Alex.
[01:16:21.579 --> 01:16:22.580]  Look at Leah Thomas.
[01:16:22.861 --> 01:16:33.009]  Swam on the men's team for three years in the NCAA, ranked 457, then switches over to the women's team, wins multiple NCAA championships, and the media cheerleads this.
[01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:36.292]   That is so against That's everything that is right.
[01:16:36.332 --> 01:16:41.076]  Those poor women that spend every weekend, every summer going to summer camp, swimming, in a pool.
[01:16:41.317 --> 01:16:46.681]  They finally make it to the top 17 in the entire country out of the thousands of colleges in America.
[01:16:46.841 --> 01:16:55.369]  There's only 17 in that final race and they got to race against a guy that has a penis and testicles and that still likes to sleep with women.
[01:16:55.829 --> 01:17:01.496]  What kind of clown world accepts that, and not only accepts it, Alex, cheerleads it for the mainstream media?
[01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:02.217]  It's absolutely insanity.
[01:17:02.237 --> 01:17:09.126]  It all is a test, Alex Stein, to see what we'll put up with, and what we'll submit with the clones, and all of it, the transhumanism coming out.
[01:17:09.446 --> 01:17:11.729]  Where does everybody find the amazing work you and others are doing?
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:16.662]  Well, listen, I want to say, you guys find me on Twitter, Instagram, Alex999.
[01:17:16.682 --> 01:17:21.685]  If you can't find me, you're not looking, and I'm not trying to virtue signal, but make sure to support you, Alex.
[01:17:21.705 --> 01:17:28.829]  You've done so much, and, you know, being fearless, and I take a lot of my inspiration from you, so you guys definitely support the InfoWar.
[01:17:29.089 --> 01:17:31.671]  And I sent Daria a great picture of the kids.
[01:17:32.151 --> 01:17:33.572]  Alex, all the youth love you!
[01:17:33.852 --> 01:17:35.053]  You are so loved!
[01:17:35.293 --> 01:17:36.453]  You have no idea, Alex.
[01:17:36.493 --> 01:17:37.154]  We appreciate you, brother.
[01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:37.974]  You're doing a great job.
[01:17:37.793 --> 01:17:39.793]  We're going to look at the Bilderberg group.
[01:17:39.793 --> 01:17:47.793]  [Music]
[01:17:47.793 --> 01:17:54.793]   All right, in about 12 minutes from now, I'm going to end this Sunday transmission with Alex Jones hosting.
[01:17:54.793 --> 01:17:56.793]  But Owen Schroer is coming in.
[01:17:56.793 --> 01:18:01.793]   And we did the Sunday live show where the radio stations and TV stations can pick it up.
[01:18:01.793 --> 01:18:03.793]  But we only do six minutes of ads an hour.
[01:18:04.523 --> 01:18:06.125]  Only the local ads.
[01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:07.186]  No network ads.
[01:18:08.211 --> 01:18:09.652]  And that's a model I want to go to soon.
[01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:11.712]  You know, I go on these other big podcasts and shows.
[01:18:11.732 --> 01:18:14.453]  They go, why do you have 14 minutes of ads an hour?
[01:18:14.533 --> 01:18:16.474]  Well, that's what TV and radio have.
[01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:18.235]  That's the industry standard.
[01:18:18.255 --> 01:18:19.615]  Some have more, some have less.
[01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.216]  14 minutes is the average.
[01:18:22.056 --> 01:18:28.878]  And that's why they couldn't de-platform us, because we had 200 affiliates on radio four years ago when they de-platformed us.
[01:18:28.898 --> 01:18:34.080]  Now we have approaching 400 radio affiliates and hundreds of TV stations.
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.741]  The broadcast has exploded.
[01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:42.286]  So as negative as all this is, and as scary as it is, it's in God's plan.
[01:18:42.967 --> 01:18:44.008]  Evil's making its move.
[01:18:44.229 --> 01:18:45.531]  We will win.
[01:18:45.611 --> 01:18:49.437]  But we have to have the courage to speak out and say no to it.
[01:18:51.633 --> 01:18:53.374]  We'll be hosting Sunday Night Live.
[01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.616]  If your station doesn't carry it, it really should.
[01:18:55.676 --> 01:19:02.441]  But regardless, InfoWars.com forward slash show, band.video, the big live show feed on the front page of the site will have it.
[01:19:03.182 --> 01:19:09.106]  We'll talk about the pedo drag show for kids in Dallas, a bunch of key reports.
[01:19:09.347 --> 01:19:14.090]  He'll be taking calls throughout the next two hours coming up straight ahead.
[01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:16.693]   And then I'll be back Tomorrow morning, 11 a.m.
[01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:23.080]  Central, right after Harrison Smith at American Journal, 8 a.m., weekdays at Infowars.com.
[01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:25.003]  But look at this right here.
[01:19:25.563 --> 01:19:28.306]  This is the photo that Alex Stein mentioned right before we went to break.
[01:19:29.107 --> 01:19:31.230]  And it's just all these great listeners.
[01:19:32.045 --> 01:19:32.565]  That are there.
[01:19:32.605 --> 01:19:34.686]  He said, not just these folks, but so many others.
[01:19:34.726 --> 01:19:35.347]  We salute them.
[01:19:35.887 --> 01:19:36.847]  Them full war shirts.
[01:19:36.947 --> 01:19:37.808]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:19:38.348 --> 01:19:40.369]  Standing against pure evil.
[01:19:40.869 --> 01:19:42.050]  Being on the right side of history.
[01:19:42.090 --> 01:19:43.470]  And look at those glowing eyes.
[01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:45.471]  Those sweet, good, smart people.
[01:19:45.991 --> 01:19:48.613]  You look at the people serving the New World Order.
[01:19:48.873 --> 01:19:50.353]  And they just look like they're dead.
[01:19:51.714 --> 01:19:53.355]  And they are just servants of evil.
[01:19:53.395 --> 01:19:55.256]  They are captured souls.
[01:19:55.956 --> 01:19:59.458]  Turned into engines of corruption and domination.
[01:19:59.558 --> 01:20:00.178]  Elon Musk.
[01:20:02.119 --> 01:20:02.960]  It's totally right.
[01:20:03.901 --> 01:20:08.084]  We have Justice Department leaks on myself, Trump, Roger Stone.
[01:20:08.705 --> 01:20:10.206]  They do congressional subpoenas.
[01:20:10.586 --> 01:20:13.249]  Then they release the stuff selectively out of context.
[01:20:14.490 --> 01:20:15.771]  They have Supreme Court leaks.
[01:20:16.371 --> 01:20:22.577]  But where are the leaks of Jeffrey Epstein's phone and Jeffrey Epstein's client list that the FBI has?
[01:20:23.858 --> 01:20:24.598]  Where are the leaks?
[01:20:24.738 --> 01:20:28.702]  We already have the public laptop with all the pedophilia on it of Hunter Biden.
[01:20:30.194 --> 01:20:31.955]  It's a cult of pedophiles.
[01:20:32.455 --> 01:20:44.481]  Because if somebody will hurt a child, they'll do anything, and they're soulless, and Satan can just swoop right in, because there is no God, there is no connection to the infinite, there is no Holy Spirit.
[01:20:45.936 --> 01:20:49.759]  So Elon Musk asks, why does the DOJ leak espionine client list?
[01:20:49.799 --> 01:20:51.440]  Doesn't that seem odd?
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.741]  Great job, Elon Musk.
[01:20:53.401 --> 01:20:56.423]  Liking you more every single day.
[01:20:56.963 --> 01:21:04.989]  And here's one of the main men dressed as a woman's, because kids dress women, at the event saying, want to get pizza?
[01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:07.991]  Hmm.
[01:21:08.151 --> 01:21:08.851]  Very interesting.
[01:21:09.572 --> 01:21:11.253]  I mentioned this quite a bit earlier.
[01:21:11.273 --> 01:21:14.495]  We're going to get into it right now.
[01:21:16.169 --> 01:21:22.198]  It's an article that's all over the place from Vigilant Citizen, and it only scratches the surface.
[01:21:22.839 --> 01:21:25.502]  It's worse than they even say here, but this article's great.
[01:21:26.243 --> 01:21:28.847]  It's at ZeroHedge.com and Infowars.com.
[01:21:30.802 --> 01:21:34.263]  Because it'll really wake people up, but it only covers some of the stuff.
[01:21:34.303 --> 01:21:36.344]  I've got some other examples, but look at this.
[01:21:37.044 --> 01:21:45.927]  The top ten creepiest and most dystopian things pushed by the World Economic Forum that is the public arm of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:21:47.547 --> 01:21:48.788]  Penetrating governments.
[01:21:49.248 --> 01:21:50.608]  We control your governments.
[01:21:50.668 --> 01:21:51.669]  We are now in control.
[01:21:51.969 --> 01:21:53.509]  We don't want the people involved.
[01:21:53.949 --> 01:21:57.250]  His own Wikipedia page says he doesn't want the people involved.
[01:21:57.571 --> 01:21:58.711]  That's called being a dictator.
[01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:00.890]  And we've got number nine.
[01:22:03.171 --> 01:22:04.051]  Number nine.
[01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:07.892]  And this article is great because it shows all the videos, all the quotes, all the clips.
[01:22:08.492 --> 01:22:08.992]  Number nine.
[01:22:09.052 --> 01:22:11.993]  Controlling minds using sound waves.
[01:22:12.653 --> 01:22:12.993]  Look at this.
[01:22:13.073 --> 01:22:15.554]  Mind control using sound waves in 5G.
[01:22:16.054 --> 01:22:17.634]  We asked the scientists how it works.
[01:22:18.075 --> 01:22:18.915]  World Economic Forum.
[01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:21.175]  The 5G will make you submit.
[01:22:21.835 --> 01:22:22.676]  You will love it.
[01:22:22.696 --> 01:22:23.516]  It's so good.
[01:22:25.305 --> 01:22:31.088]  Number 8, pills that contain microchips to make sure you're taking the pill the government orders you to take.
[01:22:31.749 --> 01:22:37.072]  That's the Davos group all agreeing you should be made to take pills with microchips in it.
[01:22:38.683 --> 01:22:51.227]  Number seven, praising massive lockdowns, praising the lockdowns that starved 40 plus million to death, demanding new lockdowns anytime there's a virus for total martial law and fear and control.
[01:22:51.427 --> 01:22:55.909]  All the clips, all the links, all the tweets, right there.
[01:22:56.949 --> 01:22:58.752]  And saying the lockdowns were good for the earth.
[01:22:59.092 --> 01:23:00.975]  Number six, take a peek in the future.
[01:23:01.455 --> 01:23:02.316]  You'll eat bugs.
[01:23:02.356 --> 01:23:03.338]  You'll have no beef.
[01:23:03.718 --> 01:23:04.880]  There are no families.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.001]  Pedophilia is legal.
[01:23:06.362 --> 01:23:09.546]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:23:10.327 --> 01:23:19.872]   It is just the declaration of war against humanity by the bankers that have stolen pure and total absolute control.
[01:23:20.332 --> 01:23:28.355]  Number five, pushing the Great Reset, shut down fossil fuels, collapse borders, end the family as we know it, get rid of small businesses.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:35.005]  The Great Reset is the Great Extermination and it goes on.
[01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:45.676]  You know, tomorrow, I think I'm going to play all the clips and the excerpts that are in this and maybe spend like two hours on it because it is so powerful.
[01:23:46.416 --> 01:23:51.742]  Rehabilitating, or excuse me, that's a Freudian slip, recalibrating freedom of speech.
[01:23:53.191 --> 01:24:08.646]  And they define that as getting rid of freedom of speech and only allowing corporate speech they want and having surveillance and AI control and lecturing you about what your speech can be or should not be.
[01:24:08.667 --> 01:24:10.448]  Number three.
[01:24:11.778 --> 01:24:14.800]  Tracking your clothes and then finally chips inside your body.
[01:24:15.241 --> 01:24:21.445]  Klaus Schwab, the UN, all of them saying it's the next phase of the global ID with the vaccine passport.
[01:24:21.926 --> 01:24:25.908]  That'll be the carbon passport that they're bringing out right now.
[01:24:26.909 --> 01:24:29.931]  Number two, smartphones will be in your body.
[01:24:30.472 --> 01:24:32.573]  You'll have to have it to leave your house by law.
[01:24:33.054 --> 01:24:35.536]  You will live in a virtual reality inside your own home.
[01:24:36.196 --> 01:24:40.159]  Number one, you'll own nothing and be happy because we will totally bankrupt you.
[01:24:42.307 --> 01:24:45.825]  And there's all the clips and all the links and every word we say.
[01:24:47.094 --> 01:24:49.695]  Every word we cover is in the document.
[01:24:50.216 --> 01:24:59.821]  What an important article from Vigilant Citizen, at InfoWars.com, ZeroHedge.com, and so many other great sites in defiance of this anti-human force.
[01:25:00.181 --> 01:25:02.622]  The war for the future is now.
[01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:04.784]  You're being made a corporate commodity.
[01:25:05.244 --> 01:25:14.689]  And if you'll let pedophiles and criminals and crazy people come have access to your children, if you'll put up with that, they believe you will put up with anything.
[01:25:16.035 --> 01:25:16.635]  But they're weak.
[01:25:16.715 --> 01:25:19.437]  That's why, since the 50s, they denied the Bilderberg Group existed.
[01:25:19.737 --> 01:25:20.697]  Then it created the Davos Group.
[01:25:20.717 --> 01:25:21.758]  It would be its public group.
[01:25:22.058 --> 01:25:24.359]  They're meeting at the Grand Orient in D.C.
[01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:24.859]  right now.
[01:25:25.219 --> 01:25:26.920]  The meeting is just now ending as we speak.
[01:25:28.001 --> 01:25:28.781]  Here's Lennon Gardy.
[01:25:28.801 --> 01:25:29.862]  I mean, forced to report on it.
[01:25:30.222 --> 01:25:35.404]  Bilderberg reconvenes in person after a two-year pandemic gaffe.
[01:25:35.444 --> 01:25:36.685]  Charlie Skelton's a great guy.
[01:25:38.024 --> 01:25:39.645]  It goes on and on.
[01:25:39.745 --> 01:25:46.050]  Bill Gates and Richard Branson are betting lab-grown meat might be the food of the future, grown from dead bugs.
[01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.853]  And they're buying up all the farmland so you can't have beef.
[01:25:50.234 --> 01:25:51.675]  It's associated with our IQ.
[01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:59.341]  And then we have the footage of the dictator of New Zealand taking orders from BlackRock and Vanguard.
[01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:05.386]  That's some of the news at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.607]  And I've got all these other stacks of news.
[01:26:09.107 --> 01:26:10.407]  Putin threatening nuclear war.
[01:26:10.487 --> 01:26:11.707]  It's back in the newspaper.
[01:26:12.268 --> 01:26:15.829]  Everybody blaming Biden for what's happening, which I hate Biden, but he's a puppet.
[01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:17.769]  It's the globalist agenda doing it.
[01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:18.889]  We've got all that.
[01:26:18.929 --> 01:26:22.610]  But Owen Schroer takes over in the next two hours.
[01:26:23.090 --> 01:26:24.431]  Only six minutes ads an hour.
[01:26:24.551 --> 01:26:25.431]  Only local breaks.
[01:26:25.831 --> 01:26:26.691]  No network breaks.
[01:26:27.051 --> 01:26:28.812]  Coming up with your phone calls and more.
[01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:34.453]  Ladies and gentlemen, I can't prosecute this war without your word of mouth and your prayer and your support.
[01:26:34.473 --> 01:26:35.193]  You've been doing it.
[01:26:35.473 --> 01:26:37.875]  We've had so many amazing things happen in the last few months.
[01:26:38.315 --> 01:26:44.279]  So many doors opened when just two months ago I could not make payroll and we thought we have to be shut down.
[01:26:45.785 --> 01:26:56.033]  And then three or four big doors opened up, big donations, small donations, new suppliers for the products, incredible companies, a bunch of other stuff that's happened.
[01:26:56.594 --> 01:27:01.257]  So thanks to the grace of God, we are still on air.
[01:27:01.537 --> 01:27:02.658]  And I want to thank you all.
[01:27:02.858 --> 01:27:05.781]  Number one, more important than a financial support.
[01:27:06.693 --> 01:27:09.516]  More important than word of mouth is prayer.
[01:27:10.077 --> 01:27:16.824]  Intercessing to God and praying for doors to open for info wars and for the truth to get out and for you to spread the word is incredible.
[01:27:17.184 --> 01:27:21.909]  So I thank you all for what you've done and tomorrow I'll talk more about the positive things that have happened as well.
[01:27:22.249 --> 01:27:25.452]   Not just the negative of the enemy but God deserves the credit.
[01:27:25.792 --> 01:27:30.073]  We don't spend enough time thanking God for intercessing through a year for your prayer.
[01:27:30.093 --> 01:27:31.814]  Because God is a God of free will.
[01:27:32.174 --> 01:27:33.355]  God is the God of the universe.
[01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:35.215]  And you've got to ask for it.
[01:27:35.355 --> 01:27:36.456]  You've got to believe in it.
[01:27:36.836 --> 01:27:37.836]  You've got to want it.
[01:27:38.637 --> 01:27:43.018]  Just like the globalists want to make contact with your children, just screw them up.
[01:27:43.098 --> 01:27:47.840]  God wants to make contact with you to empower you and fulfill you and just do amazing things.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:51.902]  So tomorrow, 11 a.m., we're talking about positive things, kicking things off.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.102]  But, whatever you do, spread the word, my friends.
[01:27:55.162 --> 01:27:58.104]  It's a real power you've got on your email, your text message.
[01:27:58.144 --> 01:28:06.110]  However, InfoWars.com forward slash show, band dot video, front page InfoWars.com, and local stations, spread the word.
[01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:12.635]  The power of millions listening can be tens of millions and hundreds of millions and billions listening if you realize the power you've got.
[01:28:12.935 --> 01:28:13.796]  Great job, crew!
[01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:16.158]  Owen Schroeder takes over in two minutes!

[01:29:07.319 --> 01:29:13.319]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:29:13.319 --> 01:29:16.758]  Thanks for being part of the Tip of the Spear.
[01:29:16.758 --> 01:29:21.719]   The worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually
[01:29:21.719 --> 01:29:23.998]  make them worse.
[01:29:24.006 --> 01:29:27.288]  We've just put together a new DVD pack for you.
[01:29:27.888 --> 01:29:31.070]  Two essential Patriot films have arrived at the InfoWars store.
[01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:36.454]  COVID Land 3 has just dropped and right now we're selling it with 2,000 mules.
[01:29:36.514 --> 01:29:48.959]   Of course, the documentary film taking America by storm right now, proving That there was mass election fraud in 2020, which is how Joe Biden got in the White House.
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:54.981]  So you can get both of those right now at InfoWarsStore.com, a combo DVD pack.
[01:29:55.382 --> 01:30:04.485]  And by the way, I purchased the digital copy, and it's the same price that we're selling the hard DVD copy with COVIDLAND 3 for.
[01:30:05.606 --> 01:30:13.965]  So, if you're gonna get 2,000 mules, you might as well go to InfoWarsTore.com to get it, because you're gonna get it for the same price, plus COVID land Part 3.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:19.223]  There are more allergic reactions to the COVID vaccines than first expected.
[01:30:19.684 --> 01:30:23.707]  Headaches, nausea, hallucinations, and yes, even death.
[01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:25.748]  I've lost count of the injuries.
[01:30:25.888 --> 01:30:36.677]  Things like urinating clots of blood, paresthesias, gastroparesis, altered mental status, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, new onset diabetes.
[01:30:36.977 --> 01:30:39.199]  I have patients who can't walk anymore.
[01:30:40.099 --> 01:30:43.122]  I've just never seen anything like this in all my years of practicing medicine.
[01:30:44.827 --> 01:30:56.312]  All these people are creating a whole conspiracy theory and they are trying to basically to benefit and profit from this fear of the people.
[01:30:56.712 --> 01:30:57.973]  And this is who are the criminals.
[01:30:57.993 --> 01:31:00.674]  Those that they don't get the vaccine.
[01:31:00.934 --> 01:31:05.396]  The people that are circulating all this misinformation, they are criminals.
[01:31:06.237 --> 01:31:12.760]  Get your DVD copy of COVID Land 3 The Shot at Infowarsstore.com
