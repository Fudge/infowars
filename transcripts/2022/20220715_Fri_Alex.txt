[00:00.000 --> 00:07.800]  American Providence is careening off the rails, as it is diverted by a spineless, tax money
[00:07.800 --> 00:11.600]  pit salesman from California known as Adam Schiff.
[00:11.600 --> 00:16.660]  You might think it's okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie.
[00:16.660 --> 00:18.080]  You might think that's okay.
[00:18.080 --> 00:19.080]  I don't.
[00:19.080 --> 00:24.740]  As the Washington Times reported, Representative Adam Schiff wants a defense policy bill to
[00:24.740 --> 00:30.280]  include language blocking Congress from oversight of the military and National Guard, in some
[00:30.280 --> 00:32.400]  cases of domestic deployment.
[00:32.400 --> 00:37.640]  The exemption from congressional oversight is narrowly focused on the domestic deployment
[00:37.640 --> 00:44.240]  of troops, but Mr. Schiff's free pass for the Pentagon could impact a range of oversight
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.360]  from border security to the January 6th riot at the U.S. Capitol.
[00:49.360 --> 00:55.680]  The U.S. military is not allowed to be involved in any way, even the most minor way involved
[00:55.680 --> 00:57.200]  in domestic politics.
[00:57.200 --> 01:02.160]  So this suggests the U.S. military under Joe Biden is involved in domestic politics.
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.360]  Well we also know, Tucker, from reporting by Newsweek that said that military assets
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.280]  were involved in January 6th, even leading up to the events of January 6th.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.480]  What was the military doing?
[01:15.480 --> 01:19.600]  We know that the military was fully hostile to Donald Trump.
[01:19.600 --> 01:25.320]  His own military leaders, including Mark Milley, were completely hostile to the president at
[01:25.320 --> 01:26.320]  that point.
[01:26.320 --> 01:32.160]  Ray Epps, not Jacob Chansley or Joe Biggs, should be the poster boy for the supposed
[01:32.160 --> 01:34.400]  insurrection on January 6th.
[01:34.400 --> 01:40.760]  As Revolver News reported, Ray Epps has turned out to be perhaps the only person nailed dead
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.000]  to rights confessing on camera to plotting a pre-planned attack on the Capitol.
[01:46.000 --> 01:52.760]  On both January 5th and January 6th, Epps announced multiple times at multiple locations
[01:52.760 --> 02:10.360]  his upcoming plot to breach the U.S. Capitol.
[02:10.360 --> 02:15.240]  He then spent three weeks attempting to recruit hundreds of others to join him.
[02:15.240 --> 02:20.920]  On top of it all, Epps was seen leading key people and managing key aspects of the initial
[02:20.920 --> 02:41.920]  breach of the Capitol grounds himself.
[02:41.920 --> 02:57.760]  During the fog of war of the events following January 6th, Ray Epps and the actors surrounding
[02:57.760 --> 03:00.880]  him were hunted by the FBI in the New York Times.
[03:00.880 --> 03:06.400]  Now Epps isn't even mentioned during SHIFTS January 6th committee hearings, and now the
[03:06.400 --> 03:11.480]  New York Times has painted Epps as a victim of conspiracy theory.
[03:11.480 --> 03:39.720]  Taking its own conspiracy theory, meanwhile, 69-year-old grandmother Pam Hemphill from
[03:39.720 --> 03:46.320]  Idaho who suffers from breast cancer and has no criminal history just began her 60-day
[03:46.320 --> 04:01.320]  sentence.
[04:01.320 --> 04:06.160]  Your government wants you to know it hates you as they cover up further evidence.
[04:06.160 --> 04:12.040]  According to the Intercept, the Secret Service erased text messages from January 5th and
[04:12.040 --> 04:19.120]  January 6th, 2021, though the Secret Service maintains that the text messages were lost
[04:19.120 --> 04:22.880]  as a result of a device replacement program.
[04:22.880 --> 04:28.400]  The letter to the Intercept says the erasure took place shortly after oversight officials
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.240]  requested the agency's electronic communications.
[04:32.240 --> 04:37.440]  The United States wasn't forged by bug-eyed corporate prostitutes.
[04:37.440 --> 04:43.960]  The revolutionary fortitude of the invigorating human spirit imbued in the Declaration of
[04:43.960 --> 04:50.680]  Independence are alien concepts to those who would twist the very character of our nation
[04:50.680 --> 04:57.160]  to fulfill the half-baked whims of their foreign, globalist masters and their dwindling party.
[04:57.160 --> 05:22.960]  John Bowne reporting.
[05:22.960 --> 05:44.920]  A
[05:44.920 --> 05:51.520]  This is history happening now info work states your support is changing the world and this is the final
[05:51.960 --> 05:53.960]  75 three-point set
[05:54.320 --> 05:56.320]  exclusively available at
[05:57.360 --> 05:59.360]  1776 point com
[05:59.360 --> 06:01.360]  I
[06:12.080 --> 06:17.800]  From Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones
[06:23.680 --> 06:26.040]  All into July first
[06:26.040 --> 06:38.280]  I was talking to Roger stone off air before he came on and I said when is Trump set to announce because he's told Roger
[06:38.520 --> 06:40.440]  That he is gonna run
[06:40.440 --> 06:46.160]  Starting about six months ago. He was planning not to he got angry. They had dinner several times and he said yes
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.660]  I'm running and he consulted Roger on what he should run. I
[06:49.160 --> 06:54.440]  Said can you talk about that on air and he said y'all talk some about it and he said look for Trump to announce in July in
[06:54.440 --> 06:55.880]  fact
[06:55.880 --> 06:58.680]  He's thinking about announcing on July 4th. I
[06:59.480 --> 07:02.320]  Mean he just talked to Trump the day before I
[07:03.200 --> 07:06.840]  Made some phone calls to members of Congress that you see on the show some you haven't
[07:07.480 --> 07:12.160]  That talked to Trump on a weekly basis and they meet with him many times in Mar-a-Lago
[07:12.680 --> 07:15.320]  And they said yeah, he's set to announce in July
[07:16.840 --> 07:18.840]  In fact, he's not even making a secret of it. I
[07:18.840 --> 07:26.560]  Went on air and I said he's may announce July 4th, but he's currently planning to announce in July now
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.360]  I said for tactical flexibility as he calls it. He might
[07:30.960 --> 07:33.520]  Not do it in July, but that was big real news
[07:34.280 --> 07:37.960]  It's all over the news today tomorrow's news today July 15th
[07:38.360 --> 07:42.200]  That Trump has done sit down interviews with major newspapers and publications
[07:42.200 --> 07:45.080]  We've got them right here, and they've talked to others that have talked to him
[07:45.080 --> 07:49.160]  And he said my question is will I announce eminently in July?
[07:50.240 --> 07:52.240]  Or will I wait till after the midterms?
[07:53.400 --> 07:55.600]  What he's doing is peaking interest in that right now
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.880]  but as of
[07:59.800 --> 08:01.800]  15 days ago
[08:02.440 --> 08:07.720]  He told Roger he's going in July. Maybe even July 4th
[08:09.120 --> 08:13.120]  Now when he didn't announce on July 4th, it was national news that Alex Jones is wrong
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.560]  Alex Jones said he would run on July 4th. He would announce it, and he didn't that's not what I said. I
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.500]  Said he told multiple people that I've talked to
[08:25.840 --> 08:35.440]  That he is going to run for president and would probably announce in July. Maybe even July 4th
[08:36.800 --> 08:38.800]  That's what I said on the Friday
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.280]  That's what now came true today
[08:41.280 --> 08:44.760]  So it happened
[08:46.160 --> 08:48.160]  Nine days ten days
[08:49.320 --> 08:51.320]  After I
[08:51.640 --> 08:53.640]  Said he was thinking about doing it
[08:54.440 --> 08:57.120]  So it's all over the news MSNBC
[08:58.200 --> 09:00.200]  ABC news you name it
[09:01.240 --> 09:08.720]  Donald Trump on 2024. I've already made that decision. I'm going to run the only question is do I announce now or after the midterms?
[09:08.720 --> 09:10.720]  Forbes
[09:10.880 --> 09:18.040]  Forbes Trump made up his mind about 2024 report says but he's unsure when to announce the real headline is Trump just announced
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.560]  But see that's the mind games and how people can't engage in even basic critical thinking
[09:26.640 --> 09:32.160]  That I mean I don't make stuff up I get things wrong occasionally, but I talked to three people
[09:33.800 --> 09:35.800]  That talked to Trump
[09:35.800 --> 09:42.360]  In the last few weeks and he told him I am going to announce
[09:43.200 --> 09:45.200]  probably in July and
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.680]  Maybe because I made that big announcement was all of the news. Maybe Trump didn't want his thunderstorm. Maybe he didn't
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.520]  Announce on July 4th because of that, but it doesn't matter. He just announced
[09:58.280 --> 10:01.040]  So Alex Jones is not always right
[10:01.040 --> 10:07.000]  Alex Jones is usually right and I try as hard as I can to be right and
[10:07.400 --> 10:10.960]  To really give you the facts here in the inside and tell as best we can
[10:12.760 --> 10:14.760]  They have a special guest who
[10:15.960 --> 10:17.960]  Was told her business is not essential and
[10:19.760 --> 10:24.200]  Then they have find her and feed her and now they're taking her business away eminently
[10:25.080 --> 10:27.160]  Because she's not essential talk about slavery
[10:27.160 --> 10:33.560]  That nice lady will be joining us coming up in studio in the third hour Oregon Salon owner
[10:35.080 --> 10:38.000]  States and chop pick of services after because I opened
[10:39.920 --> 10:44.560]  My business yeah, they won't just take your business. They'll try to take your children
[10:46.120 --> 10:48.360]  Lindsey Graham not the senator but Lindsey Graham
[10:48.360 --> 10:55.520]  Patriot Barbie calm will be joining us in the third hour of open phones for that and
[10:57.160 --> 10:59.960]  So much more here today
[11:03.640 --> 11:06.560]  Now let me go ahead and tell you some more of the news
[11:10.360 --> 11:12.360]  imminent
[11:12.360 --> 11:20.200]  Defaults by ten major governments
[11:24.000 --> 11:26.000]  Are set to be announced
[11:26.920 --> 11:28.920]  major rating agencies are
[11:30.560 --> 11:33.800]  Announcing that and guys I was shuffling my papers around
[11:33.800 --> 11:41.520]  Before the break and I can't find that one. So you reprint me ten ten ten major nations set to default
[11:41.880 --> 11:47.320]  There's a bunch of news on it, but I just I can try to dig around around the break, but I'm gonna I'm gonna be getting to that
[11:49.240 --> 11:55.640]  We have this ultra massive news Adam Schiff the globalist neural order puppet I
[11:59.120 --> 12:02.640]  Said ten nations the headline I saw US is a world report say a dozen
[12:02.640 --> 12:07.880]  I mean that's the whole point of it is once you get a bunch of dominoes going they just keep falling
[12:07.880 --> 12:10.280]  I mean we're going over the edge of a cliff. That's not a lot of ourselves
[12:11.160 --> 12:13.160]  So that's coming up to
[12:13.640 --> 12:15.160]  But this is kind of a big deal
[12:15.160 --> 12:18.080]  You know we already basically live under a form of globalist martial law
[12:18.080 --> 12:24.280]  They put us under lock-down those training wheels for it. They're bringing in the world ID. They're trying to push force inoculations and
[12:25.920 --> 12:27.920]  Now a
[12:27.920 --> 12:32.600]  A member of Congress wants the power of the purse
[12:33.040 --> 12:34.240]  transferred
[12:34.240 --> 12:39.240]  To the Pentagon where the funding and their operations do not have congressional oversight
[12:39.920 --> 12:46.120]  You want to say rogue government, baby? That's it and when the military is its own standalone unit
[12:46.200 --> 12:49.200]  You are living in a tyranny
[12:50.440 --> 12:56.320]  Schiff seeks rule that would block oversight of some military operations and guess what?
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.560]  those military operations are
[13:01.080 --> 13:03.080]  Give you a wild guess
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.160]  Domestic operations Posse come and taught us
[13:10.720 --> 13:12.400]  Because they're getting ready
[13:12.400 --> 13:17.360]  For full-on hot martial law in this country when the economy goes completely belly-up
[13:18.280 --> 13:21.160]  And that's why I've said every day. We're still on air as a blessing. I
[13:21.160 --> 13:27.000]  Try to stop this you try to stop it. We're now deep into it. At least a lot of people know what we're dealing with now and
[13:27.680 --> 13:30.000]  Folks understand it's a globalist takeover, but wow
[13:31.320 --> 13:33.080]  Wow
[13:33.080 --> 13:37.560]  And they're putting in digital surveillance digital martial law. That's what they call it
[13:38.560 --> 13:41.360]  That is just such a giant area there
[13:43.000 --> 13:46.520]  And then we've got what's going on in the public schools
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  where
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.280]  Children as young as six are being directed to secret chat rooms
[13:56.760 --> 14:00.480]  Run by the federal government to discuss sex changes
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  Activism and the occult
[14:04.720 --> 14:09.080]  And the devil worship and pedophiles are right out in the open now
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.080]  Kid come here with us and get in a secret chat room talk about sex
[14:15.080 --> 14:21.640]  The average person does that the FBI bust them they go to jail, but not when it's the almighty pedophile run
[14:22.600 --> 14:24.600]  collapsing US government
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.680]  They also have a bunch of videos of the world economic forum having their 40th anniversary and
[14:37.680 --> 14:44.200]  World leaders pledging allegiance to Klaus Schwab a
[14:46.400 --> 14:48.400]  Super villain

[19:31.880 --> 19:39.480]  Including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown as for vitamin C and zinc themselves
[19:39.480 --> 19:45.840]  You probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health
[19:45.920 --> 19:49.240]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate
[19:49.760 --> 19:52.640]  Even in affluent populations like here in America
[19:52.640 --> 19:58.920]  So next time you visit be sure to check it out at info or store.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie
[19:58.920 --> 20:08.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[20:32.560 --> 20:34.560]  Friday live
[20:34.600 --> 20:40.120]  Donald John Trump is announced. He is running for president in 2024 Alex Jones right again
[20:40.680 --> 20:43.400]  Just 11 days later than I said
[20:44.160 --> 20:46.160]  He said I'm running for president. I
[20:46.680 --> 20:52.880]  Just don't know when I'll launch the official campaign, but the declaration he is running is he's running. He said my mind is my own
[20:53.760 --> 20:55.760]  I won't be intimidated
[20:55.760 --> 20:57.560]  I'm throwing down the gauntlet
[20:57.560 --> 20:59.440]  I'm running for president
[20:59.440 --> 21:04.640]  to be the 47th president and the 45th president of the United States of
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.520]  America
[21:06.520 --> 21:11.880]  And everything that entails and what that means. Thanks for joining us on this live Friday broadcast
[21:12.480 --> 21:13.760]  all right
[21:13.760 --> 21:17.080]  I'm gonna hit the amendment to the house rules
[21:18.480 --> 21:21.360]  Offered by mr. Schiff of California coming up
[21:21.360 --> 21:27.520]  To put the United States under military dictatorship. That's what it is. Just cut and dry like it's no big deal
[21:27.520 --> 21:30.840]  Like everything else you see is over the top. It's really happening. You just saw
[21:31.680 --> 21:35.840]  two years plus of on and off again lockdowns and masks and
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.120]  attempts at forced inoculations and many groups were forcibly injected like our military and
[21:42.280 --> 21:45.480]  Now the real martial law is coming ahead of the total financial collapse
[21:45.480 --> 21:51.680]  We have dozens of major nations set to default on their sovereign debt Russia already did it last week
[21:52.320 --> 21:57.840]  This is just incredible. This is mind-blowing. I know why the average person can't believe all this because it's horrible
[21:58.240 --> 22:01.560]  But you need to know about bad so you prepare for it and be ready
[22:02.960 --> 22:05.960]  Speaking of that, let me just go ahead and say this is a status report on
[22:06.720 --> 22:13.800]  the state of independent free media in America and on info wars and on the info wars family and everything that the listeners and viewers
[22:13.800 --> 22:15.800]  And supporters have done in your investment
[22:16.200 --> 22:22.240]  In my quest in your quest in the last 28 years to expose the global to try to stop their new order takeover
[22:22.240 --> 22:27.680]  Or they did launch or take over have folks ready to understand the submission to it only makes it a hundred times worse
[22:29.120 --> 22:33.280]  We've reached billions of people we've awakened hundreds of millions together and
[22:36.280 --> 22:39.520]  Now the challenges we face are the same challenge everybody else faces
[22:39.520 --> 22:44.960]  Inflation a collapsing economy supply chain breakdowns the annihilation of the family exploding crime
[22:45.840 --> 22:49.920]  And I truly love this audience of activists, and I truly love this crew. They're amazing people and
[22:51.680 --> 22:54.720]  In the last three months I brought in two outside
[22:55.560 --> 23:02.400]  Accounting firms to really look at the back books look at the current books project forward and come up with the real numbers we have
[23:03.560 --> 23:07.160]  And I know that with the capital injections
[23:07.160 --> 23:13.120]  I made with the emergency backup savings we had because any real operation needs, you know, at least a tent of a tank
[23:14.360 --> 23:16.160]  that
[23:16.160 --> 23:18.160]  Despite all the donations and all the support
[23:18.800 --> 23:25.360]  In about a month info wars will be insolvent. We don't have the money to battle these three sandy hook trials that start
[23:26.280 --> 23:31.680]  July 25th here in Texas or in Connecticut a week later. They'll have two trials at once going
[23:31.680 --> 23:33.720]  I mean, it's just insane the judges don't care
[23:33.720 --> 23:39.360]  They say they're gonna order me to be two places at once. I mean, it's just it's just incredible tearing
[23:40.040 --> 23:46.440]  The judge in Texas is issued an order saying I will not be allowed to defend myself or speak about the first amendment or anything else
[23:46.440 --> 23:52.920]  It's gonna be one-sided. I'm guilty and I'm just there to be pummeled and yelled at and then I can't talk seriously that that's official
[23:53.880 --> 23:59.280]  People can't believe it. No one's ever seen it. I think this is worse than Guatemala or North Korea
[23:59.280 --> 24:05.420]  But nevertheless, they will compel me and make me go there or they will lock me up
[24:05.720 --> 24:11.720]  This is what these people are doing. It's all just a sick attack on populism. They see Alex Jones as you as
[24:12.120 --> 24:14.680]  The populist is flyover country that they dearly hate
[24:15.760 --> 24:18.440]  So with the projections the good news is
[24:19.320 --> 24:23.240]  Some supply chains a little bit better. We got some better manufacturers bigger ones
[24:23.240 --> 24:28.680]  One of the dozen plus products that have been sold out for 60 months to a year came in bodies ultimate to reformula
[24:28.680 --> 24:31.280]  That's bringing in every day about a third of the money we need
[24:31.800 --> 24:37.560]  In the next month or so more of those products come in and I trust you'll be there and you love them and that will get a stable
[24:38.080 --> 24:40.080]  but in the interim
[24:40.080 --> 24:45.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I tell you this I'm 100% firing the bat signal and the SOS
[24:45.960 --> 24:50.080]  signal and explaining what you've invested in and what you've built and what's going on here
[24:50.080 --> 24:52.080]  Will collapse
[24:53.200 --> 24:54.800]  Within a month
[24:54.800 --> 24:57.960]  Right as the money starts to come in. It's just it's insane
[24:58.480 --> 25:04.040]  If you don't support so I need people to go to the live show feed and put that headline back up this headline about Trump
[25:04.560 --> 25:08.400]  Donald John Trump has announced he is running for president 2024 Alex Jones right again
[25:09.640 --> 25:14.760]  And if you scroll down under the live show feed there is a link because it's so hidden for whatever reason at
[25:14.760 --> 25:21.320]  infowarstore.com and I have a banner added at the top of the site to donate. You can go right below the live show feed right there
[25:21.960 --> 25:28.160]  Please donate today to keep info wars on the air so we can defend the First Amendment and fight the globalist agenda
[25:29.720 --> 25:31.720]  We need to bring in
[25:31.920 --> 25:38.120]  $20,000 a day because we pay for our own satellite up links our own bandwidth our own infrastructure
[25:38.120 --> 25:43.840]  Midsize small-town newspapers cost 10-15 million dollars a year. That's why they all went bankrupt and shut down
[25:44.640 --> 25:49.840]  And then you didn't have local news anymore, but so many of them were just echo chambers. It wasn't that big a loss
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.840]  info wars imploding and our independent infrastructure
[25:56.040 --> 25:58.040]  that
[25:58.040 --> 26:03.040]  Creates the truthful narrative that so many others then pick up on is something we can't lose
[26:03.040 --> 26:08.240]  And so I come to you respectfully and I come to you humbly asking you for your aid now
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.240]  As we send this
[26:12.760 --> 26:14.760]  letter out
[26:14.760 --> 26:19.680]  With an emergency rider in this digital Alamo that we're in because we'll go on to the end
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.720]  We'll do it all and I would imagine once we start shutting down people are gonna freak out and we have much donations
[26:25.040 --> 26:27.040]  but something that
[26:27.360 --> 26:29.360]  Is that something that
[26:29.360 --> 26:36.880]  We have much donations, but something that is this complex is very hard to turn back on and with the
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.000]  Debanking and the attacks and everything it'll be very very hard for us to operate
[26:42.160 --> 26:46.160]  Into the future even as a shadow of ourselves. I mean here's an example
[26:46.600 --> 26:50.880]  We have six seven million people clicking and watching videos a day at Bandai video
[26:51.440 --> 26:56.440]  We can lower the bandwidth where it's not really a quality video stream and save about half the money
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.160]  And we may have to do that. I really don't want to but we had to build our own infrastructure
[27:00.160 --> 27:05.560]  You understand the hundreds of billions of dollars that go into Google video and in Twitter video and in YouTube
[27:06.080 --> 27:09.200]  We don't have that we you don't have that the people have
[27:10.520 --> 27:17.640]  Bandai video that is then getting picked up everywhere and amplified with millions and tens of millions of views on every other
[27:17.640 --> 27:20.480]  Platform every day, but they have to come there to the production platform
[27:20.920 --> 27:24.560]  That has hundreds of people that have been censored different providers on it
[27:24.560 --> 27:28.640]  And we try to pay for that with advertising, but if we didn't have the product in
[27:29.320 --> 27:35.880]  Because of supply chain issues and problems then we don't have the products, but the product will be here soon
[27:36.440 --> 27:38.440]  bodies came in
[27:39.440 --> 27:42.440]  Vitamin refusion gets in next week. It'll start to stabilize
[27:43.880 --> 27:49.960]  And then we've got to take that money and pay the other 50% on the other nine products
[27:49.960 --> 27:53.880]  That's why and then when that happens in the next month and a half
[27:54.960 --> 27:58.640]  It's about a month and a half then we'll be stabilized and be able to fund and run things
[27:58.640 --> 28:05.480]  But I need money now or your investment in time and energy will go down in flames right at a moment
[28:06.640 --> 28:10.080]  We're having a bigger effect in the world than we've ever had
[28:10.680 --> 28:15.720]  So yes by the products at info or store.com and by the Alex Jones's right t-shirt
[28:15.720 --> 28:20.280]  Because that's all the other shirts we sold at cost to get them out to the public with that when we sold a premium
[28:20.280 --> 28:24.320]  You know raise ten dollars on the regular shirt and twenty dollars on the custom shirt
[28:24.320 --> 28:29.200]  You go buy that all day at the mall for you know way more why not support the truth while you still can
[28:29.520 --> 28:35.000]  Get a Dinesh de Souza two thousand mules get an in-game whatever you do go to info or store.com
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.400]  But the easiest thing to do is go the live show feed where it says donate or go to info or store.com
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.320]  Where it says support and just go make a one-time or recurring donation
[28:43.320 --> 28:46.840]  You know who you are and I thank you and whoever gave that a Bitcoin man
[28:46.880 --> 28:48.720]  We would be shut down right now without you
[28:48.720 --> 28:52.560]  We had to use all that to pay off back bills and buy products in the future, but it hadn't come in yet
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.720]  So we need your support now info or store.com and I thank you all and I have faith in you
[29:00.040 --> 29:06.320]  Seven months ago in December of 2021 we launched the first in the three coin founding member series
[29:06.320 --> 29:13.400]  George Washington slaying the dragon then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally the second amendment come and take it
[29:13.400 --> 29:15.400]  Molan lobby point there are only
[29:16.080 --> 29:20.280]  75 points left in the three-point series
[29:21.080 --> 29:23.080]  exclusively right now at
[29:23.080 --> 29:26.480]  1776 point.com for the final
[29:26.920 --> 29:30.960]  75 people become founding members for this big project. We're launching in the near future
[29:30.960 --> 29:37.960]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art. I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf and a personal message
[29:37.960 --> 29:40.680]  It's your last chance to get all three points at
[29:41.360 --> 29:46.200]  1776 point.com. This is history happening now
[29:46.600 --> 29:50.800]  Info work states your support is changing the world and this is the final
[29:51.280 --> 29:54.760]  75 three-point set exclusively available at
[29:55.040 --> 29:58.360]  1776 point.com
[29:58.360 --> 30:01.720]  There is nothing there is no more
[30:02.440 --> 30:05.480]  epitome of free speech than right here and
[30:06.200 --> 30:12.240]  That's what people recognize and resonate with and as word said you're not gonna find a better place for
[30:12.960 --> 30:18.640]  Information you might not agree with everything you might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information and
[30:19.400 --> 30:24.480]  There's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank you for that word info war store.com by the way
[30:24.480 --> 30:29.680]  The products he mentions info war store.com is where to get them folks and we do have the best supplements
[30:29.680 --> 30:33.920]  I mean just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information
[30:34.640 --> 30:41.080]  We do the best with our supplements as well. I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks
[30:41.080 --> 30:44.920]  This is a joke. I mean we're giving this thing away at 75% off
[30:44.920 --> 30:51.120]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working for me
[30:51.120 --> 30:57.920]  Quite well, I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men
[30:57.920 --> 30:59.720]  I go and see him quite often now
[30:59.720 --> 31:07.000]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago
[31:07.200 --> 31:13.240]  The bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs for your drains your boats
[31:13.240 --> 31:17.080]  It goes on and on it'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water
[31:17.080 --> 31:21.880]  But it's been so successful now. We're selling it to major RV parks
[31:22.440 --> 31:28.680]  Pig farms you name it because this stuff will eat anything that is organic
[31:28.680 --> 31:35.120]  And it's exclusively available at the bio pros calm and now info or store calm
[31:35.160 --> 31:37.560]  We sold out of this for almost a year
[31:37.560 --> 31:44.040]  But we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at info or store calm
[31:44.040 --> 31:51.840]  They'll also find instructional videos and more information at info or store calm or the bio pros calm made America
[31:52.400 --> 31:56.760]  Powered by God's great creation. It is amazing and it funds the info work
[32:04.480 --> 32:10.440]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with fish oil
[32:10.440 --> 32:17.680]  It's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and that's an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is
[32:18.080 --> 32:22.400]  Liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there
[32:22.400 --> 32:27.080]  Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you want something like this
[32:27.080 --> 32:32.600]  You don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be I'm not a medical statement here
[32:32.600 --> 32:37.960]  But let me tell you something I eat five capillates of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night
[32:37.960 --> 32:44.320]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is
[32:46.920 --> 32:53.080]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess cuz whatever the best is we've got I just can't lie to you
[32:53.080 --> 32:55.080]  I just can't do it
[32:55.080 --> 33:06.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[33:06.360 --> 33:33.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[33:36.760 --> 33:39.240]  I want everybody listening to my voice
[33:41.560 --> 33:46.120]  To say a prayer for awakening and for justice, please if you feel the way I do
[33:48.120 --> 33:54.520]  And I want to ask all the viewers and listeners and affiliates and just sponsors and everybody that cares about the truth
[33:57.560 --> 33:59.560]  To understand something
[33:59.560 --> 34:05.880]  I told you a few years ago. This is long gonna get worse and I don't think you need me to tell you that you know that
[34:06.760 --> 34:08.760]  I want everybody include myself
[34:09.720 --> 34:14.520]  Let it really sink in that this is a new type of war high-tech siege
[34:15.400 --> 34:18.520]  The purposeful destruction of the world economy and total collapse
[34:20.360 --> 34:23.080]  And it's gonna be long and it's gonna be slow and they're gonna
[34:23.080 --> 34:29.960]  Take their time strangling us while they consolidate total power and control the end game having power over our bodies
[34:32.360 --> 34:37.560]  And just as Winston Churchill gave that speech after the British forces have been driven into the ocean at Dunkirk
[34:38.680 --> 34:40.680]  But the real kickoff of world war two
[34:41.720 --> 34:43.720]  All I can offer you is the truth
[34:44.360 --> 34:47.880]  And the truth is a lot of blood a lot of sweat a lot of tears and a lot of pain
[34:50.200 --> 34:52.200]  But total submission to this tyranny
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.320]  And the things it's gonna do is gonna be a thousand times worse
[34:55.960 --> 34:57.960]  Than what we're gonna go through saying no to this
[34:58.440 --> 35:00.440]  Everybody's got their breaking point
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  I've got mine. You've got yours
[35:03.320 --> 35:06.520]  And you just got to have a breaking point where you break with the system
[35:07.320 --> 35:09.320]  And you understand it's predatory and insane
[35:10.840 --> 35:14.440]  See once you get evil in high places it then recruits more evil
[35:14.920 --> 35:21.080]  And then even more twisted sick evil people replace those evil people and then those sickos get replaced
[35:21.080 --> 35:27.160]  With worse and worse people. That's why organizations like al-qaeda and other groups end up, you know
[35:27.720 --> 35:30.120]  raping children and eating people's hearts and
[35:31.720 --> 35:33.720]  Because the very worst
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.720]  Of the worst of the worst are going to replace
[35:38.280 --> 35:40.280]  Who was the worst last month?
[35:40.360 --> 35:43.960]  And it just always inevitably goes into a death spiral
[35:44.840 --> 35:47.080]  Now the globalists know that as historians
[35:47.080 --> 35:52.520]  They like evil. They like destruction. They like power. They are triggering the collapse
[35:53.080 --> 35:58.920]  That decadence and evil always brings pretending like they're in control of it because they understand that processing
[36:00.600 --> 36:02.600]  Talk about smoking your own dope
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.200]  Talk about drinking your own Kool-Aid
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.760]  And then you've got all the people Pavlovianly trained and conditioned
[36:10.760 --> 36:16.360]  On social media that is nothing but a digital reeducation camp
[36:19.240 --> 36:26.680]  Getting up before congress the heads of federal agencies and in groups saying men can have babies
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.400]  Pedophilia is good and you look at that you go. What is that? That's mind control
[36:35.400 --> 36:39.560]  That's the slave a lot of these people believe it
[36:42.200 --> 36:44.200]  And they find power
[36:46.360 --> 36:48.360]  In
[36:48.360 --> 36:56.360]  The brainwashing and and and in in giving into it and actually believing their lie can destroy logic
[37:00.360 --> 37:02.360]  They decide to believe two plus two equals ten
[37:02.360 --> 37:06.920]  You know, I was sent a clip by Eddie Bravo of this morning
[37:08.600 --> 37:11.800]  of the John Burt society video from the 1990s
[37:14.280 --> 37:16.920]  And you'd think they'd been in a time machine to the future
[37:17.800 --> 37:21.080]  And we cover some of these very UNESCO documents in in-game
[37:22.360 --> 37:24.360]  blueprints for global enslavement
[37:24.360 --> 37:35.960]  And they explain how that from 2005
[37:36.760 --> 37:44.280]  To 2015 through UNESCO in the world brainwashing system of the UN that took control of all major education systems on earth except for handful of countries
[37:45.800 --> 37:49.160]  Russia's not under it. They still follow it. China is not
[37:49.160 --> 37:55.560]  Commanded by it, but basically follows it. They're a member of UNESCO
[37:57.480 --> 38:05.880]  And it's teaching people to not have logic and believe two plus two equals five and have total moral relativism
[38:09.320 --> 38:11.320]  Brainwashed into the children
[38:11.320 --> 38:18.520]  So they don't know which end is up and boy did their brainwashing program their gaslighting program work like a charm
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.240]  And you know, I know I used to own this video and a bunch of other things
[38:23.960 --> 38:27.880]  People ask how I know so much these people were directly over the target starting in vietnam
[38:32.440 --> 38:36.360]  And we everybody's got to look to their archives and their records and
[38:36.360 --> 38:38.360]  And
[38:39.320 --> 38:41.720]  Put those back online somewhere I can reach out to the
[38:42.440 --> 38:45.080]  JBS, I guess they had we like to put the stuff on band on video
[38:46.600 --> 38:48.600]  But this stuff's evergreen
[38:49.160 --> 38:54.360]  I mean, this is a copy of a copy of a digital copy. So it's all foggy. I remember watching this very presentation
[38:56.120 --> 38:58.840]  And it was uh, and then these presentations were given
[38:59.880 --> 39:01.880]  to legislators
[39:01.880 --> 39:07.320]  In fact, I'm going from memory. There's only a piece of it, but I think this was in front of the kentucky
[39:09.800 --> 39:11.800]  Legislature in like 1996
[39:13.480 --> 39:15.480]  But but the point is is that
[39:16.840 --> 39:18.840]  This is a plan
[39:18.920 --> 39:23.080]  And the people brainwashed by it really think they're on a winning team because they're delusional
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.240]  Even though in the real world, they're gonna get poor. They're gonna be enslaved. They can't even come to grips with it
[39:29.560 --> 39:31.560]  Here's the clip
[39:31.560 --> 39:37.240]  The people who are perpetrating these things expect to do this and make it last and the answer to that is that you
[39:37.720 --> 39:39.720]  steal a generation of children
[39:40.120 --> 39:42.360]  And you indoctrinate them so that they
[39:42.920 --> 39:47.560]  Accept these ideas and they become global citizens in the coming global village
[39:48.440 --> 39:51.320]  UNESCO came out and declared
[39:52.600 --> 39:57.960]  2005 to 2015 the decade of education for sustainable development
[39:57.960 --> 40:03.000]  But they go on to say that it will encompass the 40 chapters of agenda 21
[40:03.080 --> 40:06.120]  That is your federal national curriculum
[40:06.360 --> 40:11.800]  The entire purpose of second grade social studies is to transfer loyalty from the family to the government
[40:12.680 --> 40:16.360]  And teach them about sustainable economic consumption
[40:16.920 --> 40:22.600]  Students construct their own understandings of reality and realize that objective reality is not knowable
[40:22.600 --> 40:31.880]  So why bother? The truth is the truth which keep men free is being suppressed in order to prop up the attitude training agenda
[40:32.120 --> 40:33.560]  And it moves on
[40:33.560 --> 40:41.000]  This is our new math called connected mathematics standard three tells us that students learn that mathematics is man made
[40:41.480 --> 40:43.480]  That it is arbitrary
[40:43.560 --> 40:46.120]  And good solutions are arrived at by consensus
[40:47.240 --> 40:50.280]  Most of us assume two plus two has always been equal four
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.320]  You're wrong. We might reach a new consensus
[40:54.440 --> 40:57.720]  How well does it work? Well, they tell you in the teacher's guide in the back
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.840]  It tells us that because the curriculum doesn't emphasize arithmetic computations done by hand
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.880]  Some students may not do as well on tests assessing computational skills
[41:08.760 --> 41:16.840]  We believe such a trade-off in the favor of cmp is very much to the students advantage in the world of work
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.560]  Our children are mathematically illiterate
[41:22.440 --> 41:23.800]  on purpose
[41:23.800 --> 41:27.560]  How do I know on purpose? Why isn't this just a basic bad idea?
[41:28.280 --> 41:30.920]  Because the sustainable development plan tells us so
[41:31.640 --> 41:38.120]  Generally more highly educated people who have higher incomes consume more resources than poorly educated people
[41:38.120 --> 41:46.920]  Who tend to have lower incomes in this case more education increases the threat to sustainability
[41:48.680 --> 41:51.960]  Charlotte is or be I owe you an apology
[41:53.560 --> 41:57.560]  I did not believe for the longest time. It was a deliberate dumbing down
[41:58.280 --> 42:02.200]  I thought the dumbing down was a natural consequence of a bad idea
[42:03.240 --> 42:05.240]  folks, it's deliberate
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.600]  The sustainable globalist goal is the orchestration of a planned fall of american principles
[42:13.320 --> 42:15.320]  Values and lifestyles
[42:15.880 --> 42:19.000]  The effect on the average american will be devastating
[42:19.720 --> 42:25.480]  With modernizing technology the ordinary person will live without independence
[42:26.680 --> 42:29.000]  Privacy or substantive rights
[42:29.000 --> 42:36.520]  Another press conference that I attended was the IKLEI group the international committee for local environmental initiatives
[42:36.600 --> 42:39.960]  that helps in the implementation of agenda 21 in all of our local communities
[42:41.320 --> 42:42.840]  and
[42:42.840 --> 42:45.080]  One of the speakers was a Harvey Reuven
[42:46.120 --> 42:48.920]  Who happens to be the vice chair of IKLEI?
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.880]  And I asked him about the correlative rights that americans derive
[42:53.880 --> 42:59.240]  From the united states constitution and the bill of rights and that of course is your

[47:39.960 --> 47:41.960]  Seems like you're only
[47:41.960 --> 47:43.960]  Are you soon in i'll recap it
[47:43.960 --> 47:49.000]  Those are from the UNESCO UN world plans. I've seen them myself
[47:49.640 --> 47:53.560]  Gone to the library back in the 90s couldn't believe it pulled up the UN documents
[47:54.760 --> 47:56.600]  Made films about it
[47:56.600 --> 47:58.600]  America's robot design was the first
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  Now you see that name is correct today, isn't it?
[48:03.160 --> 48:05.160]  25 years later
[48:08.200 --> 48:10.680]  Poor people don't consume as much
[48:10.680 --> 48:14.680]  We're going to make people dumb and poor actually said that
[48:17.080 --> 48:23.160]  And now they're so mind controlled and so dumb they think a man can have a baby and oh two women had a baby in the prison
[48:25.400 --> 48:27.400]  And in the u.s in
[48:27.800 --> 48:29.480]  england
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.560]  Because they do it as an activism thing men go in with beards muscles tattoos
[48:34.120 --> 48:37.000]  They get up the stirrups nurse comes in doctor comes in
[48:37.640 --> 48:39.640]  He says check my cervix
[48:39.640 --> 48:41.640]  For HPV
[48:43.320 --> 48:45.320]  And the doctors all over the world
[48:46.280 --> 48:48.920]  To go to the west they say all right your cervix is clear
[48:52.760 --> 48:54.760]  They don't have a vagina
[48:56.200 --> 48:59.240]  They don't have a cervix, but you know why they do those checkups
[49:01.560 --> 49:04.360]  You know why the tampon makers all say men have periods too
[49:04.360 --> 49:06.360]  You
[49:09.080 --> 49:11.080]  Because it's mind control
[49:13.560 --> 49:15.560]  There it is
[49:15.560 --> 49:17.560]  Yes, men need pap smears too
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.320]  And if you don't give the man the pap smear
[49:22.760 --> 49:24.760]  You don't check his penis for a cervix
[49:26.280 --> 49:27.880]  You get fired
[49:27.880 --> 49:32.040]  People go that's insane. No, that's not insane. That's mind control
[49:32.040 --> 49:37.080]  How are the pedophiles going to get to the point where they can have sex with your children publicly?
[49:37.560 --> 49:44.920]  They're going to normalize everything else and scramble everybody's brains and they've done it to a large portion of people
[49:49.080 --> 49:53.240]  Yeah, why don't you cue that up since you pulled it up the I need a good laugh or a good cry
[49:54.040 --> 49:56.040]  From I don't know almost a year ago now
[49:56.600 --> 49:58.600]  Stephen Crowder's show
[49:58.600 --> 50:03.480]  This piece got censored off YouTube by the way with all the men getting women pregnant in prison
[50:05.240 --> 50:07.240]  And
[50:07.320 --> 50:10.440]  We made a whole joke about it. You ready with that guys?
[50:11.800 --> 50:13.800]  Go ahead and roll it
[50:19.480 --> 50:21.960]  Do not be afraid for behold
[50:21.960 --> 50:28.520]  I bring you good tidings of great joy, which will be to all people for there is born to you a baby
[50:28.920 --> 50:32.920]  In this cell and this shall be a sign unto you. Oh
[50:33.080 --> 50:35.080]  Virgin birth a miracle
[50:35.640 --> 50:38.440]  No, your cellmate that guy dresses a woman
[50:41.560 --> 50:45.160]  He's going to rape you. I'm a girl
[50:46.840 --> 50:48.840]  Repeatedly
[50:48.840 --> 50:55.000]  But it's not funny is it it's actually very very very very very sad
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.600]  All right, I mentioned a lot of
[50:59.640 --> 51:01.640]  Just ultra massive information
[51:02.360 --> 51:06.680]  And I'm going to plow into it in detail in the next hour and I'm going to open the phones up
[51:09.000 --> 51:13.640]  For veterans and current active duty serving military and police only
[51:13.640 --> 51:18.680]  And we're going to calls quick now. You've heard me. I'm really getting to him. So you won't be on hold that long
[51:19.560 --> 51:21.560]  We're taking five six calls a segment
[51:24.040 --> 51:26.360]  What do you make of the democrats introducing a bill
[51:28.120 --> 51:32.120]  That the house of representatives of the congress and the house armed services committee will no longer be
[51:32.520 --> 51:34.280]  involved in oversight
[51:34.280 --> 51:39.960]  Of the funds or operations of the pentagon for domestic military operations. That's domestic
[51:39.960 --> 51:44.280]  Martial law and it's in the different presidential decision directives that go back decades
[51:44.840 --> 51:49.000]  Bipartisanly that in a total emergency congress suspends its control
[51:50.600 --> 51:52.600]  Over the purse strings for six months
[51:53.000 --> 51:57.960]  This would statutorily put it into place and it's just being announced like it's no big deal
[51:59.960 --> 52:04.680]  I'd like to hear from you on that and how it ties into the control collapse how it ties into the
[52:04.680 --> 52:09.160]  Sjw critical race theory and forced inoculation to drive out the best people from the military
[52:09.800 --> 52:12.280]  Military recruiting falling to all-time lows
[52:12.600 --> 52:15.560]  Defunding the police so they can kick out the cops. They don't like bringing the
[52:16.040 --> 52:18.600]  Politicos and commas ours. They do control
[52:20.600 --> 52:25.400]  And it ties into all this other news, but I'm going to go right to your calls. Bam, bam, bam
[52:25.800 --> 52:29.800]  Finally broken my bad habit of not getting the calls by first five years on talk radio man
[52:29.800 --> 52:32.600]  I was the king of taking 30 40 calls an hour
[52:32.600 --> 52:36.520]  And I got to be really bad about ever even taking calls, but I like calls listeners like calls
[52:36.840 --> 52:38.840]  I love the different angles you bring up
[52:38.840 --> 52:40.840]  So I want to hear from law enforcement military
[52:41.480 --> 52:43.480]  active-duty veterans
[52:43.480 --> 52:49.800]  On this and just what it means with major governments defaulting on debt massive inflation open borders. I mean
[52:50.520 --> 52:56.680]  They're really collapsing things to then bring in the tyranny as the solution and they're saying they want to hell. Yes
[52:57.160 --> 52:59.160]  ban our semi-autos
[52:59.160 --> 53:04.600]  The toll-free number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[53:05.080 --> 53:08.600]  two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine Alex
[53:10.120 --> 53:14.600]  And I can say I've fought really as hard as I can that a lot of great success together
[53:15.080 --> 53:17.080]  whatever happens
[53:17.080 --> 53:19.640]  God's on our side at the end of the day and this evil will pass but
[53:19.880 --> 53:23.000]  The question is how bad's going to get first and I'm going to leave it all in the field
[53:24.040 --> 53:26.040]  I'm going to stay on air as long as we can
[53:26.040 --> 53:29.640]  There's a real spirit of evil in the nation in the world. There's a real spirit of
[53:30.600 --> 53:32.600]  of
[53:32.600 --> 53:34.600]  dysfunctionalism
[53:34.600 --> 53:36.600]  That's been put out there by design
[53:36.600 --> 53:40.120]  And it's creeping into every facet of life and all we got to do is love our children
[53:40.600 --> 53:42.600]  Love each other love God
[53:42.920 --> 53:49.000]  Not hate each other but defend ourselves and just be as good of persons as we can. I know this is all a big test
[53:50.200 --> 53:53.160]  Satanists think they're doing their stress test with a great reset God's the best
[53:53.160 --> 53:58.520]  Satanists think they're doing their stress test with a great reset. God's put us through a real great reset and a real stress test
[53:58.520 --> 53:59.960]  so
[53:59.960 --> 54:02.840]  Leave it all the field ladies and gentlemen. That's what this is all about
[54:03.720 --> 54:05.720]  And there's so much other news here
[54:07.640 --> 54:09.880]  Wait to hear what they're doing with the six month olds with the shocks
[54:09.960 --> 54:14.760]  It's killing them and it's hurting them and they know what they're just doing is an act of raw power
[54:15.640 --> 54:17.640]  They can't outright rape them
[54:17.800 --> 54:20.440]  They're gonna rape them biologically chemically
[54:20.440 --> 54:24.840]  With these injections, it's just it's just very very painful, but
[54:26.040 --> 54:29.160]  We killed the unborn we euthanized the old and now we're all fair game
[54:30.200 --> 54:34.200]  When are we gonna hit bottoms the question? That's another question for listeners. When are we gonna hit bottom?
[54:34.200 --> 54:38.040]  I'd like to hear your take on that eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine
[54:38.600 --> 54:41.000]  Your calls are coming up eight seven seven seven eight nine
[54:41.400 --> 54:43.400]  Alex
[54:43.400 --> 54:44.200]  separately
[54:44.200 --> 54:47.320]  I'm trying to front load the plugs here today because we need to stay on air
[54:47.320 --> 54:50.760]  We've gotten real first rate accounting done
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.160]  To actually project out what we need what the expenses are what's going to happen
[54:58.040 --> 55:00.040]  And if we don't
[55:00.200 --> 55:03.160]  Raise major capital in the next month
[55:04.680 --> 55:06.680]  We're completely out of even reserves
[55:07.880 --> 55:09.880]  And the good news is in a month and a half
[55:10.680 --> 55:15.240]  We got the numbers were enough of the product that's been sold out that with past projections is popular
[55:15.240 --> 55:17.240]  We will be doing actually okay
[55:18.520 --> 55:20.520]  You know with a tent the tanker gas instead of
[55:21.240 --> 55:22.280]  fumes
[55:22.280 --> 55:24.760]  We're on fumes right now. We got great products. You need
[55:25.560 --> 55:27.560]  It could be your last chance
[55:27.480 --> 55:30.840]  Seriously to get an Alex Jones's ride shirt or get an in-game
[55:31.480 --> 55:34.680]  Or to buy body's ultimate turmeric formula or
[55:35.960 --> 55:39.080]  To make a donation. I mean we'll still be able to do that. We'll still have something going here
[55:39.160 --> 55:42.680]  But I really need you to go to info or store.com and get the great products
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.480]  And I need you to go to the front page of info or calm in the live show feed of the day
[55:48.040 --> 55:50.280]  Where Trump announced he's running for president told you that was coming
[55:50.920 --> 55:56.600]  Right underneath the live show video feed. We have a link that takes you right to the sub page at info or store.com
[55:57.800 --> 55:59.800]  And we're gonna add a banner
[56:00.600 --> 56:06.120]  To the top of info or calm and enforce where calm to make a donation a one-time or recurring
[56:06.600 --> 56:09.560]  So it's easy to find whether it's $10 or $100
[56:09.560 --> 56:14.520]  This is one place. You really know you're fighting a new world order. This is one place
[56:15.000 --> 56:19.560]  You really know you're having a big effect and I just can't imagine a world where info wars isn't here
[56:19.560 --> 56:25.560]  But the democratic party and the lawsuits and the attacks and everything has basically almost run us to ground
[56:25.720 --> 56:27.400]  We're about to go to the rocks
[56:27.400 --> 56:30.600]  I don't have this will or the the strength to turn the wheel myself
[56:31.160 --> 56:34.120]  Together we can turn the wheel of the ship and not run in the rocks
[56:34.120 --> 56:39.320]  And we're be doing pretty good as we fix our supply chain problems in about three months
[56:40.440 --> 56:42.440]  I need to be at the point where
[56:42.440 --> 56:46.440]  I only plug twice a day instead of every hour or whatever because we'll be doing well
[56:46.760 --> 56:51.320]  We have a lot of plans to continue on but it is nip and tuck and it's just god showing us that hey
[56:51.720 --> 56:56.920]  I'm the one that gets you out of the trouble always bringing me right to the edge and I have total faith in you
[56:56.920 --> 57:00.440]  But thank you for your passport. Don't let that support be lost
[57:00.440 --> 57:04.120]  Let your investment of liberty and freedom and stick into the new world order continue
[57:04.840 --> 57:06.840]  infowarstore.com
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.880]  or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[57:12.920 --> 57:13.880]  and
[57:13.880 --> 57:16.360]  We fixed a lot of problems found out about a lot of issues
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.640]  Fixed a lot of things the last few months. I've been spending more time
[57:20.440 --> 57:22.760]  Getting the finances right and learning everything about it
[57:23.240 --> 57:27.080]  Instead of just you know selling product and hoping enough money came in and then nobody orders the product
[57:27.080 --> 57:29.080]  there's a supply chain problem and then
[57:29.080 --> 57:31.640]  I've had that about a lot of other stuff too like
[57:33.160 --> 57:37.880]  Somehow it got flipped to the default that all the supplements had to be california standard when nobody can do that
[57:37.960 --> 57:43.160]  So just saying not california standard prop 65. So that's other reason we couldn't get product is they were doing california standards
[57:43.240 --> 57:45.240]  No one can even do that. So we're
[57:45.480 --> 57:47.880]  We're gonna go we're gonna go to industry standard not california standard
[57:49.960 --> 57:54.520]  Seven months ago in december of 2021 we launched the first in the three coin
[57:54.520 --> 58:01.240]  Founding member series george washington slaying the dragon then we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally

[58:42.120 --> 58:48.280]  Three coin set exclusively available at 1776 point dot com
[58:48.280 --> 58:50.280]  Look at that
[58:50.920 --> 58:56.280]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured. It's been worked out. We didn't do that
[58:57.880 --> 58:59.880]  You think I would metaphysically
[59:00.120 --> 59:04.120]  Tell you something this is the very best I can get I'd rather go to hell and do that
[59:04.600 --> 59:10.920]  I will only give you the maximum best info the maximum truth the maximum product because I
[59:11.560 --> 59:16.600]  Want that good will what I do to you. I do to myself. Don't you get the big secret?

[59:21.560 --> 59:24.680]  And this little jewel right here is solid

[59:36.120 --> 59:41.640]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible the number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[59:41.640 --> 59:48.200]  Is take good fish oil or krill oil just like our informations dynamite store our products in four store dot com
[59:48.200 --> 1:00:10.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:20.920]  Are we seeing the earth?
[1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:23.560]  We've got it
[1:00:24.520 --> 1:00:26.520]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:29.160]  You've got it
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:32.120]  Are we seeing the earth?
[1:00:32.760 --> 1:00:34.760]  You've got it
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:48.760]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[1:00:50.120 --> 1:00:52.520]  Evil has organized itself
[1:00:55.240 --> 1:01:00.840]  Into very powerful forces and it's confused and scrambled most people's moral compasses
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:04.040]  None of us are perfect
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.400]  But some a lot worse than others and it's here
[1:01:09.480 --> 1:01:12.520]  And the new world order knows humanity was awakening
[1:01:13.720 --> 1:01:16.760]  So it's accelerating its operation into warp speed
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  Now I'm gonna open the phones up this hour
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.840]  from former military veterans current military law enforcement about
[1:01:28.120 --> 1:01:31.960]  Adam Schiff the democrats introduced bill for no financial or
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:33.960]  political military oversight
[1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:39.320]  Operational oversight of the military. I mean that's just a staggering
[1:01:40.120 --> 1:01:42.120]  bill to be introduced
[1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:48.520]  As if congress in a bill could give up its oversight that's in the constitution
[1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:54.440]  That's military dictatorship they're setting up
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:57.240]  Tucker Carlson covered it last night
[1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.240]  In fact, I'm gonna air John Bounds report again at the start of the next segment and then go to your calls
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:09.240]  Because it's so important and he actually shows the clubs in the documents, but right now. Let's just go ahead and get to the first caller here
[1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:15.240]  And and Matt wants to bring this up. It's true
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:21.720]  They're using the cover of nuclear war as the pretext to put the emergency system in or to activate the emergency system
[1:02:21.720 --> 1:02:27.720]  Matt said massachusetts says he has friends the national guard new york preparing for nukes. Give us your information
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:31.720]  Hey, thanks for having me on alex and thank you for everything you do
[1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:40.760]  So I'm in massachusetts and I have a lot of friends in the national guard one of them's an e8 actually a couple of my e7s
[1:02:41.720 --> 1:02:48.760]  And uh, one of them called his wife who are good friends with the family and told us, you know, he's he was sent out to training two weeks ago
[1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:52.760]  He was only supposed to be there for a week
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:58.200]  So we get his wife gets a phone call and he's telling her. Hey, listen, I'm gonna be out here longer
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:00.920]  I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be here
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:04.600]  But there's something I gotta tell you and she says what and he says listen
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:06.760]  They have us doing a lot of weird stuff
[1:03:06.760 --> 1:03:10.600]  He said I've been out here training at night and for the last week
[1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:14.600]  We've been doing night training and he said basically quote unquote training
[1:03:14.600 --> 1:03:20.040]  They have us loading live ordinance into the back of trucks under the complete cover of darkness
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.440]  They're not allowed to use any flashlights
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:28.680]  The buildings where they're getting the ordinance from they're not allowed to have lights on the trucks are not allowed to have lights on
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  And they're only allowed to use nods
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.680]  Which is uh the acronym for night vision for the military
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:39.000]  And he tells his wife you said hey listen you got to tell our friends and I want you to do this
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:44.680]  You need to go get extra batteries and you need to fill up the gas cans for the generator and go get more gas cans
[1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:48.680]  He said there's a lot of rumors floating around. I don't know what's going to happen
[1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:51.960]  So on top of that a week ago in new york
[1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:54.440]  released a public service announcement
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:04:00.200]  Where they had a thing on tv telling people what to do in the invent of a nuclear explosion
[1:04:00.840 --> 1:04:03.720]  Now I have other friends in there. So I wanted to confirm this
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:10.040]  So I asked I asked one of my other buddies to give a call and ask what's going on. I said hey you in training
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:15.320]  And he said yeah, I'm in training. I'm in new york. And I said I'm like what you're in new york
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:21.240]  Okay, so he said I'm only supposed to be here for two weeks and now they're telling us but they don't know how long we're gonna be here
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:28.440]  And I was like really and um, and that's what they do in a war. They deploy the troops first to go last to know
[1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:34.760]  Yes, yep, and he said the same exact thing that they're doing a lot of training at night
[1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:37.160]  I asked him. I said are you training at night with live ordinance?
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:40.200]  And there was about an hour pause before a message came back
[1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:44.760]  And he said how the bleep do you know that and if he doesn't know I'm talking to the other one
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:47.800]  And he said there's a lot of weird stuff going on. I don't know
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:52.600]  Matt stay there. Don't hang up and I'm gonna go to mike rodney angel jim jonathan
[1:04:52.600 --> 1:04:57.800]  Surfer joe dr steward and joe your calls are all coming up
[1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:06.280]  Seven months ago in december of 2021 we launched the first in the three coin founding member series
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:08.360]  George washington slaying the dragon
[1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:14.360]  Then we launched the tree of liberty coin and finally the second amendment come and take it molan laby coin
[1:05:14.760 --> 1:05:20.280]  There are only 75 points left in the three point series
[1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:26.360]  Exclusively right now at 17 76 point dot com and for the final
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.080]  75 people become founding members for this big project. We're launching in the near future
[1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:34.040]  You'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:37.880]  I made of the sheep dog chasing the wolf and a personal message
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:44.200]  It's your last chance to get all three coins at 17 76 point dot com
[1:05:44.440 --> 1:05:49.240]  This is history happening now info war station support is changing the world
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:58.360]  And this is the final 75 three coin set exclusively available at 17 76 point dot com
[1:05:58.360 --> 1:06:14.040]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.440]  American providence is
[1:06:22.440 --> 1:06:31.000]  Careening off the rails as it is diverted by a spineless tax money pit salesman from california known as adam schiff
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:36.040]  Do you might think it's okay that the president is reported to have helped dictate that lie?
[1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:40.440]  You might think that's okay. I don't as the washington times reported
[1:06:40.680 --> 1:06:48.200]  Representative adam schiff wants a defense policy bill to include language blocking congress from oversight of the military
[1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:57.800]  And national guard in some cases of domestic deployment the exemption from congressional oversight is narrowly focused on the domestic deployment of troops
[1:06:58.040 --> 1:07:08.360]  But mr. Schiff's free pass for the pentagon could impact a range of oversight from border security to the january 6th riot at the us capital
[1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:16.360]  The u.s. Military is not allowed to be involved in any way even the most minor way involved in domestic politics
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:21.400]  So this suggests the u.s. Military energy of biden is involved in domestic politics
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:29.080]  Well, we also know tucker from reporting by newsweek that said that military assets were involved in january 6th
[1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:32.360]  Even leading up to the events of january 6th
[1:07:32.600 --> 1:07:41.080]  What was the military doing and we know that the military was fully hostile to donald trump his own military leaders including
[1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:49.080]  Mark milley were completely hostile to the president at that point ray epps not jacob chansley or joe biggs
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:57.880]  Should be the poster boy for the supposed insurrection on january 6th as revolver news reported ray epps has turned out to be perhaps
[1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:08.280]  The only person nailed dead to rights confessing on camera to plotting a pre-planned attack on the capital on both january 5th and january 6th
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:15.480]  Epps announced multiple times at multiple locations his upcoming plot to breach the us capital
[1:08:29.720 --> 1:08:31.720]  He then spent
[1:08:31.720 --> 1:08:40.120]  To recruit hundreds of others to join him on top of it all epps was seen leading key people and managing key aspects of the
[1:08:40.120 --> 1:08:43.320]  Initial breach of the capital grounds himself
[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:55.560]  Far, it's that correction. We spread the word. All right, no dave, but one more thing. Yes, sir. Can we go up there? No, when we go in? Are we gonna get arrested? We go up there?
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:57.560]  We don't need to get shot
[1:08:57.560 --> 1:08:59.560]  All
[1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:19.320]  During the fog of war of the events following january 6th ray epps and the actors surrounding him were hunted by the fbi in the
[1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:30.600]  New York times now epps isn't even mentioned during shifts january 6 committee hearings and now the new york times is painted epps as a victim of conspiracy theory
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:35.080]  Creating its own conspiracy theory. The piece describes ray epps as a
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:43.080]  Disappointed trump support. Well, here's the only thing ray epps as far as we know did not go to this speech
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:51.400]  Here is the alleged trump supporter ray epps who traveled all the way from arizona to washington dc
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:53.800]  and doesn't even attend
[1:09:53.800 --> 1:10:03.400]  The speech meanwhile 69 year old grandmother pam hemphill from idaho who suffers from breast cancer and has no criminal history
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:10.120]  Just began her 60 day sentence mom. What do you have to say to the american people is your last words before you go in
[1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:16.440]  Keep your faith. No matter what's going on in your life. God's with us. No matter what's happening to us
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:20.520]  Do what's right and and help make this country better again
[1:10:20.760 --> 1:10:25.240]  Your government wants you to know it hates you as they cover up further evidence
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:32.600]  According to the intercept the secret service erased text messages from january 5th and january 6th
[1:10:32.600 --> 1:10:40.680]  2021 though the secret service maintains that the text messages were lost as a result of a device
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:47.800]  Replacement program the letter to the intercept says the erasure took place shortly after oversight officials
[1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:56.760]  Requested the agency's electronic communications. The united states wasn't forged by bug-eyed corporate prostitutes
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:04.360]  The revolutionary fortitude of the invigorating human spirit imbued in the declaration of independence
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:11.000]  Are alien concepts to those who would twist the very character of our nation to fulfill
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:18.040]  The half-baked whims of their foreign globalist masters and their dwindling party john bound reporting
[1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:25.160]  We knew the globalist were planning this attack they'd been attested in the third world
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:29.400]  And we fought to stop them launching it
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:32.680]  But it's really a paradox because they had to go ahead and launch it because we were winning
[1:11:33.320 --> 1:11:38.520]  But it's better that they launch it on bad footing than launch it from a winning perspective
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.080]  They're losing but they're still going ahead with
[1:11:41.880 --> 1:11:44.600]  People say well, why'd you take them on why why we push them into a corner?
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:48.520]  Well, it's better that we do it on our terms and we know who they are
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:51.720]  Then just let them keep us in the dark and still do it comprende
[1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:55.240]  I think we did the right thing
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:12:00.040]  I know we did the right thing. I want to go back to your phone calls, but we were just talking to maddy talked of his friends
[1:12:00.600 --> 1:12:02.440]  in multiple states
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:04.600]  who were doing nighttime martial law drills
[1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:07.640]  for the power being off
[1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:10.120]  and combating basically the american people
[1:12:10.120 --> 1:12:16.120]  Nuclear war drills and you have introduced legislation that the military can operate domestically
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:18.600]  in the u.s. Without congressional oversight
[1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:21.640]  If that in treason, I don't know what is for those that don't know
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:29.000]  In the constitution it is bedrock law that the military is under the control funding wise of congress
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:34.200]  And the president and they're saying the military will operate on its own
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:37.400]  Make a law where they're their own new branch of government
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:41.320]  I mean it's it that means the globalist top people
[1:12:41.560 --> 1:12:46.520]  Everybody keeps looking for the military to come save you the rank and file military are on average the best
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.400]  people in the world most of my family are veterans
[1:12:51.160 --> 1:12:53.960]  My ancestors they were all I mean just incredible men
[1:12:55.720 --> 1:13:01.240]  And they taught me everything about the new world order and they told me the military was controlled in the 70s and 80s
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:09.160]  And I had family in the u.s. Army that went around killing people in the united states on assassination squads. Let's just get that straight
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:13.560]  So I know what I'm talking about and they didn't like what they were doing then
[1:13:15.400 --> 1:13:17.400]  Killing people extrajudicially
[1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.520]  So the u.s. Government's been out of control
[1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:24.040]  for a long long time and now is completely
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:26.680]  and totally out of control
[1:13:26.760 --> 1:13:28.760]  and run by globalist
[1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:33.320]  They were killing mafia people and gang bangers and communists without
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:36.120]  even a death warrant
[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:43.000]  30 40 years ago in this country and and people them were like this could be used against us someday. Guess what it is now
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:49.320]  And so you need to understand that and really let that burn in ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:54.520]  Matt go ahead and finish up with what you said your friends were telling you about the
[1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:57.720]  Creepy drills they're doing
[1:13:57.720 --> 1:13:59.720]  yeah, so
[1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:07.800]  Um, they'll load. I guess the most creepy thing he was saying is that they're loading truck after truck with live ordinance into the complete cover of darkness
[1:14:08.520 --> 1:14:11.400]  Um, and he's he told me that in his 15 years of service
[1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:13.560]  He's never done any type of training like this
[1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:19.640]  And they've never sent them to new york to do this usually when the massachusetts national guard does their training
[1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:24.520]  They go down to the borne base, which is on the cape or they go to uh fort devins
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:28.360]  Um, so they're over in new york doing this now. I don't know if you covered this
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:34.440]  But the same week that they're there training new york television released a public service announcement
[1:14:34.440 --> 1:14:39.080]  It was a video and it freaked a bunch of people out to the point where the governor had to respond to it
[1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:43.000]  Telling people what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:45.880]  um, so
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:52.920]  It just seems to me like uh things things are really getting serious over here enough where people that are 15 20 years in
[1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:57.400]  Are freaked out by what's going on and calling their wives telling them to go buy extra batteries
[1:14:57.480 --> 1:14:58.840]  Go get extra food
[1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:02.280]  Go fill up the gas cans for the generator tell our friends to do this
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:03.880]  We don't know what's going to happen
[1:15:03.880 --> 1:15:09.480]  But I guess there's a lot of rumors going around and when she asked what are the rumors going around he's told her
[1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:14.040]  I really can't say anything on the phone and I shouldn't even have said this to you on the phone
[1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:18.200]  So I just want people to know if you have friends in the guard or you're in the guard
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:22.360]  You should be paying attention to what you're doing for training because i'm pretty sure you're going to be doing this
[1:15:22.360 --> 1:15:24.680]  Kind of stuff and I I hate to say it
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:27.800]  But I really think something's going to happen in new york and that's why they're over there
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:31.320]  And that's why they're being told they don't know how long they're going to be over there
[1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:35.160]  I god bless you. I appreciate your call. I mean, I'll tell you what is in the cards
[1:15:35.240 --> 1:15:40.520]  Not just stage mass shootings not just bombings to be blamed on from supporters and info warriors
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:42.920]  You already see that but
[1:15:42.920 --> 1:15:46.760]  A nuclear false flag to be blamed on russia and then we go into marshal off forever
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:52.120]  That's why I don't I don't I don't I don't have a fatalistic feeling. I have a really sad feeling
[1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:54.840]  uh because

[1:20:41.480 --> 1:20:47.640]  Trump needs to announce for president now he needs to come out like the sanis has done and
[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:56.280]  Bolsonaro and apologize for being looped into the poison shots and moved past that
[1:20:57.240 --> 1:21:04.040]  And say no to the martial law and no to the new world order and realize that the enemy isn't going to give up with their political defeats
[1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:06.520]  And the fact that everybody hates them they're going to take over
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:15.720]  And they're bringing the lockdowns back abc news is reporting. It's so sad

[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:35.560]  As well first
[1:21:36.280 --> 1:21:39.160]  Mike is in colorado. He's an immigrant from poland
[1:21:39.160 --> 1:21:44.920]  Well, that's a good thing to do to open the phones up to immigrants to talk about what they left and what they see happening here
[1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:46.920]  There's some of the most powerful testimonies. Mike
[1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:54.280]  You want to comment on quote the usa going bad? That's a good way to put it going bad
[1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:57.080]  Mike give us your take
[1:21:57.080 --> 1:22:03.960]  Yeah, so first of all, I just want to let you know that I've heard your back signal and I ordered a whole bunch of
[1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:07.480]  The preparedness foods I have
[1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:15.000]  The protein the protein heavy one and the one month supply and already had a couple before
[1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:20.200]  And then I ordered a whole bunch of like x2 ultra 12 oils and everything so
[1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:27.720]  Thank you. Yeah, and yeah, so going back to where I came from. I was a teenager in my late 50s now
[1:22:28.680 --> 1:22:34.360]  I was in the in my late teens when everything transpired in poland with like valenza and
[1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:40.600]  The solidarity movement and you're talking about martial law and this feels like right before it right now
[1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:44.440]  They had show trials just like we have the january 6th
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:48.040]  You know the all the people who were striking in the shipyards
[1:22:48.040 --> 1:22:53.080]  They were they were on tv and non-stop bashing of of of them
[1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:54.760]  um
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:57.160]  The kind of the follow-up on the previous caller
[1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:05.000]  All kinds of rumors going around that, you know, the military is getting ready to go and you know, they're getting the tanks filled up with fuel
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:09.800]  Uh, and then of course, you know a few weeks later. This was in uh, december of 1981
[1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:15.000]  They rolled out the tanks and just started going through the streets and shutting everything down
[1:23:15.640 --> 1:23:16.760]  um
[1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:23.480]  Then also you had your uh coupons issued so like say you wanted a tank of gas. You only had one tank in gas a month
[1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:28.360]  Uh, you could only have a like a kilo of meat a kilo of sugar
[1:23:28.920 --> 1:23:32.920]  Uh, there were restrictions on how much coal you could have and of course at that time
[1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:37.320]  Uh, everybody had coal burning fireplaces or you know furnaces
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:42.440]  And um, so you only had so much so your house was always cold because it was you know
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:50.040]  That just a very little amount and now they're announcing everybody's going to be cold or not have air conditioning. It's all the same plan
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:55.320]  Yeah, it's it's surreal. I mean I I my family escaped it and you know
[1:23:55.960 --> 1:24:01.160]  My parents and listening to my dad is like listening to you alex and it's it's unreal
[1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:05.000]  You know, I grew up with with that sort of view and always the non-stop fighting
[1:24:05.560 --> 1:24:09.400]  And you know for the longest time it was like, oh, we're in america. It's free everything is great
[1:24:09.400 --> 1:24:15.560]  And now it's like what the hell is going on? We're this is like what we live through already. Why is this story repeating itself?
[1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:17.320]  What what's going on here?
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:20.840]  I don't know what the average americans are gonna do when they lose everything. It's yeah, I'm
[1:24:21.800 --> 1:24:23.800]  It's just so sad
[1:24:24.040 --> 1:24:29.080]  Oh, I agree. I can't sorry. I mean, I just I just wanted to give you my perspective and it's not that
[1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:35.160]  Um, I want to make people sad or or whatever we need to know what's happening and and and I hear you
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:40.520]  It's an exact feudalist globalist plan the common is carried out against your people and everybody else
[1:24:40.840 --> 1:24:44.520]  And now it's happening to all of us again. God bless you. I appreciate your call
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:51.880]  Powerful it's true too same globalist ran that that run this same damn scum
[1:24:54.200 --> 1:24:57.400]  Joel in california and then angel joe you're on the air
[1:24:58.600 --> 1:25:01.560]  Hey, how's it going? I was just uh, good to speak with you
[1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:06.120]  Um, first time caller. Um, and uh, I buy all your vitamins. You guys are awesome
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:11.080]  Um, I wanted to speak on the the the bill that they're proposing and it makes sense because
[1:25:11.800 --> 1:25:17.800]  Um, you know, they're terrified of mid-term elections. Um, you know, they can only cheat so much and because of
[1:25:18.040 --> 1:25:21.480]  And I said in an issue your u.s. Army combat vet giving your take on
[1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:27.400]  The democrats trying to hand dictatorial power of the military. I mean, how is that not a big story? It's it's it's
[1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:32.680]  It's double canary in the coal mine man. This is the parrot in the coal mine. This is gigantic
[1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:38.280]  Oh, it's huge and it's bad because fox news became liberal and they don't even report on it either and it
[1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:42.360]  You know, you know, they're scared of mid-term. They really are and they've they've cheated so much
[1:25:42.440 --> 1:25:45.720]  But because thank the lord for dinesh the susan 2000 mules
[1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:49.640]  You know, he showed half this country that you know, but we were right. We're not crazy
[1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:55.000]  And you know, they're terrified of it and I think trumps holding off on announcing because
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:01.160]  I think he's trying to be strategic about it because they're I think they're trying to destroy this country as fast as they can
[1:26:01.400 --> 1:26:03.400]  because if he
[1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:09.640]  He's declared early and roger agrees. He told trump dad trumps it. Well, I may do it. July 4th. Now. He announced obviously today
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:15.560]  So, I mean, he needs to come out against them and and it's a new world order and a great reset
[1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:19.880]  And he needs to basically follow what I'm saying and what took a Carlson saying he needs to do it now
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:24.360]  We don't have time by the way. They're not saying the Iranians are gonna kill him. No, they're gonna kill trump
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:26.840]  They're gonna kill trump trump better announced now
[1:26:28.360 --> 1:26:32.360]  No, hi, you know, and I'm with you, you know problem is if trump doesn't listen sometimes and you know
[1:26:33.080 --> 1:26:35.320]  You know, but yes, his mind is his own. I know
[1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:41.400]  You know, and the problem is too is the the military I was in the military you you do your toll
[1:26:41.880 --> 1:26:45.480]  You know, we're we're scared of you know, the typical the real american work
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:49.640]  You know, and we're afraid to get into dishonorable discharge for not following orders
[1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:55.960]  And the problem is is the higher up. They're all democrats. They're all liberals. They're all part of the government
[1:26:55.960 --> 1:26:59.640]  Oh, I know there's this right wing thing with Q that the militaries are gonna save us
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:02.120]  Yeah, 50 years ago the military had their leadership
[1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:07.000]  They have put globalist in every position of power the guy that runs the nuclear waste dumps
[1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.800]  Where's a dress to work and supports pedophilia?
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:16.440]  Oh, no, I know it's disgusting and you know, and they're trying I think they're trying to collapse as fast as they can because they
[1:27:16.440 --> 1:27:20.360]  Know a hundred percent that you know, they they if if you know
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:23.800]  We get house the house in the senate and if trump gets back in
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:29.240]  You know a hundred binds exactly they know we're winning which is why they're gonna make their move now
[1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:33.160]  And that's why everything is so critical. God bless you. I appreciate your call

[1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:53.000]  Don't like getting up here saying buy this buy that but when you're not giving hundreds of millions of dollars like other media by George Soros
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:58.840]  Or Bill Gates. They prop it all up. None of the media makes money. There's a glut of media. There's a media war
[1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:02.600]  That's why there's millions of outlets and the globalists have flooded the zone. This is key
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:06.840]  With this info and propaganda, but we cut through it. That's why they're so scared of us
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:14.040]  And again to our guests our callers our information is the most powerful. We've got to stay on air. You think you think I want to
[1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.600]  Sit up here and beat you over the head for support. I don't

[1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.280]  On the situation just say hey, we're gonna let the military run everything look
[1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:16.920]  Back in the 80s when I was on active duty
[1:37:17.160 --> 1:37:20.840]  And we spoke with this amongst ourselves as soldiers back then about
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:25.560]  Having our guns on the street military point guns and convenience. This was not going to happen
[1:37:26.200 --> 1:37:28.200]  And that's why you know every veteran
[1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.560]  Because of what branch everybody in active duty shares
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:38.200]  Local police departments y'all please. I mean listen to me. Please y'all pay attention to what these people are telling you
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:40.200]  This is all out. You know, this is a dictatorship
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.480]  And if we have to watch and be very careful
[1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:47.960]  Of the people that we do have in power up in the white house and at pentagon
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:53.080]  We don't know which side really these people are on but when you're looking at a human race
[1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:57.720]  We're on the brink of this total just destruction now. You know, it's written all in scriptures
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:04.040]  It's going to be a time that we got to stand up right now right now as you've been preaching just like you told about the uh
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:10.040]  When we was going over uh, uh, Dwight the eisenhower the military industrial complex and everything we were warned of this
[1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:16.120]  Everybody need to stand up and get out here right now and get off your butts to date and say no
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:21.000]  We're not going to allow this to happen in this country. We got to stop this now. It's we got to stop this
[1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:24.440]  Well, as you know angel being a veteran and obviously a smart person
[1:38:25.720 --> 1:38:27.720]  This happens in most places in the world
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:32.680]  And believing it can't happen here is foolish plus it is happening. It's not about to happen
[1:38:33.080 --> 1:38:37.720]  It's all happening destroying the currency dissolving the border promoting pedophilia
[1:38:37.960 --> 1:38:41.080]  Preparing the military for war saying they want to confiscate our guns
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:48.200]  Uh going after free speech surveilling people. I mean, we've got a foreign multinational corporate group of criminals
[1:38:49.560 --> 1:38:52.680]  In charge our average enlisted men and women are great people
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.920]  But the folks running it at the top are absolute globalists and now
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.680]  They're activating it and saying congress is watching his hands
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:03.640]  Is saying whatever the military does it just does
[1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:07.240]  We don't have oversight about what's about to happen
[1:39:07.240 --> 1:39:11.720]  That that doesn't look too good. I mean, what does that look like to you?
[1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:13.560]  I mean, it's insanity
[1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:18.440]  It's total insanity and I mean if every day people sit out here and not understand and look at the whole program
[1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:21.000]  I mean, like I've been listening you for over 15 years, Alex
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:25.480]  And I sit here every time, you know, and I talked to people and I did a matter of fact yesterday
[1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:29.880]  I was wearing my uh my space force, uh shirt t-shirt that I ordered from you guys who
[1:39:30.440 --> 1:39:34.360]  And uh, you know, people love it, you know, they see the info wars flag and everything on the side
[1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:38.840]  I love it and I'm gonna tell you what is uh, some people are coming around and not fully awake
[1:39:39.080 --> 1:39:41.720]  But they start asking questions. I start putting out information
[1:39:41.720 --> 1:39:46.440]  I start promotion promoting info wars more I do and uh, I want to do a quick plug
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:51.000]  On the vitamin mineral fusion, uh, that real quick. I got to put in on
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:54.520]  Uh, I take a lot of medications from va and stuff. They help me
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:56.680]  You know, I have a lot of joint pains and everything else
[1:39:56.840 --> 1:40:02.120]  But when I even with the vitamin mineral fusion with all those essential minerals and everything in it a man
[1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:05.800]  I have my energy my joint aches and pains my fingers
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.920]  I was able to use my hands and everything and I'm telling people if y'all can get out there and buy these products
[1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:14.600]  Go out there to the info wars store. Check everything out without them
[1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:17.560]  They're not pushing poison. They're not pushing garbage and junk out there
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:20.840]  Go out there and use these things these things work that they put out there
[1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:26.200]  These are great supplements and you guys keep that going. Okay, bam. I'm jumping right back. I bless you angel. Thank you
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:31.400]  Let me say this. It's all the highest quality vitamins and minerals. It's been sold out for over six months
[1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:39.000]  We had like a thousand canisters in the warehouse that accounting didn't know was there and found that sold out like in 10 minutes last week
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:42.600]  It supposedly gets here next week and the way this works is
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:46.840]  We got to have an FDA tested again and double checked and everything, but it's done
[1:40:47.320 --> 1:40:52.280]  15,000 canisters that'll pay for a lot of stuff once we get that and I just can't wait for it to get here
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:54.280]  And I'm totally honest with the audience
[1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:58.680]  I've dug into everything around here and I found out why
[1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:05.160]  We did have so many products it was supply chain was part of it
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:09.880]  The other part was and you know, god bless our FDA compliance people, but I didn't tell them to do this
[1:41:09.880 --> 1:41:11.880]  I said follow industry standards
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:14.680]  We've been doing california standards for years
[1:41:15.800 --> 1:41:18.120]  And they were sometimes making our manufacturers
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:23.720]  Reduce stuff three four times. You can't pass california standards with most products
[1:41:24.120 --> 1:41:26.280]  If they're multi multi ingredient products
[1:41:26.840 --> 1:41:29.800]  There's more lead in the air than they'll let you have in a product
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:35.240]  And so make the announcement now. We're going to standard us system
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.520]  now
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  And thank god we got some bigger better
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:45.240]  Manufacturers and explain that to us. They're like, well, we'll really try to do your california standard
[1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:52.200]  But that's going to cost you all the testing because nobody does that the lawyers wrote that law 15 years ago in california to bankrupt everybody
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:56.920]  All you got to do is put on the container doesn't follow california standards
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:00.840]  And so that's the weird stuff about business in life
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:07.240]  My main thing is the show and information and research and I try to just sell good products and have the highest standards
[1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:11.880]  I'm like, I want the highest standards. Well, I didn't know what I was saying. I guess I'm the one that did that
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:20.280]  What are the standards too high? It's like saying carbon dioxide is poison. So you can't have a coal plant. Well, carbon dioxide is good
[1:42:22.200 --> 1:42:25.080]  And so that log jam is being fixed
[1:42:26.920 --> 1:42:31.080]  The products are getting ready to come in and we'll be good, but we need money now
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:34.680]  So the biggest thing that raises money for us is the alex jones. Let's write t-shirt
[1:42:35.400 --> 1:42:40.040]  At infowarstore.com and we need to move these films out. Everybody's in their archive
[1:42:40.040 --> 1:42:42.680]  I know dbd's old technology, but it's great to have the information
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:49.320]  2,000 mules with a free copy of the order of death while supplies last to the order of death at infowarstore.com
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:56.360]  Get 2,000 mules and a free copy of my film two films on bohemian grove of the occult and infowarstore.com
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:43:03.160]  We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil companies
[1:43:03.160 --> 1:43:10.120]  Around the world to the civilian market two years ago the bio pros for septic tanks for porta potties for RVs
[1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:15.720]  For your drains your boats it goes on and on it'll eat the oil off of your driveway if you just add water
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:20.520]  But it's been so successful now. We're selling it to major RV parks
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:27.240]  Pig farms you name it because this stuff will eat anything that is organic
[1:43:27.240 --> 1:43:33.400]  And it's exclusively available at the bio pros dot com and now infowarstore.com
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:36.040]  We sold out of this for almost a year
[1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:42.680]  But we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is at infowarstore.com
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:50.440]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at infowarstore.com or the bio pros dot com made america
[1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:57.480]  Powered by god's great creation. It is amazing and it funds the infowar.
[1:43:58.360 --> 1:44:04.360]  The eugenicists over a hundred years ago were very public about their plans. They financed major universities. They ran
[1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:06.840]  full page stories and
[1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:10.920]  Advertisements pushing their propaganda of new york times other major newspapers
[1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.800]  That the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:44:14.440 --> 1:44:19.400]  It must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household and teaching
[1:44:19.400 --> 1:44:24.840]  Women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing
[1:44:25.320 --> 1:44:27.320]  And I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[1:44:27.960 --> 1:44:32.520]  For my daughter my four national daughter. My wife makes dinner a lot of times, but I like to make it as well
[1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:33.880]  I love to make breakfast
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:38.120]  And literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[1:44:38.680 --> 1:44:42.120]  And then all sit down together and have the communal event
[1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:47.000]  And that's what the system is attacking and bombarding is our normal
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:54.200]  Biological actions are coming together. They really are sick evil scientific cult of filth and want to domesticate us
[1:44:54.600 --> 1:44:57.480]  And turn us into lab rats. We cannot let this continue
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:07.480]  Granny do right granny do right. Thanks for holding her on the ear. Go ahead challenge. First of all, let me say
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:10.120]  I love your products. I am a granny and
[1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:15.320]  For all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun like me
[1:45:15.320 --> 1:45:19.560]  I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called
[1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:27.560]  But since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:34.200]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:36.600]  Because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:39.720]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[1:45:39.880 --> 1:45:43.320]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing
[1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:47.880]  Okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful. You know, I don't
[1:45:48.760 --> 1:45:56.440]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin

[1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:44.600]  Right back to your phone calls we stand in the democratic party has entered a bill
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:47.720]  sponsored by the party
[1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:53.480]  To remove congressional oversight of the u.s. Military in all branches of it
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:48:00.200]  Domestically in the united states that is the definition of martial law
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:04.920]  No civilian oversight of the military. You can't have a stronger
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:07.880]  definition, I mean it's
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:12.200]  The highest card in a deca cards is the ace of spades
[1:48:13.320 --> 1:48:15.320]  This is the ace of spades
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  of tyranny
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:22.120]  I mean it's it's it's just
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  Fathomless that they would do this
[1:48:27.080 --> 1:48:29.240]  But
[1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:35.960]  They brought forward untested. They'd secretly tested them gene therapies that cause cancer and destroy your DNA and attack your liver and heart
[1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:41.480]  And now they're giving it to six month olds and up and i've got a stack of reports that's killing them the government knows it
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:43.560]  I mean mainline reports
[1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:49.800]  They are destroying confidence in the system. They are making us angry to have a civil war
[1:48:50.120 --> 1:48:54.200]  Klaus Schwab a very angry world will collapse the old system
[1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:57.000]  You will then own nothing and have nothing at the end
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.280]  And they're doing it
[1:49:00.920 --> 1:49:02.920]  And I watch the people that serve the system
[1:49:03.480 --> 1:49:10.120]  Pretending like they're gonna come out on top doing this with their children that live in this world
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:13.320]  It is crazy town
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:17.880]  All right taking calls the order that they are received
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:22.440]  That would be geo in texas geo. Thanks for holding go ahead
[1:49:24.680 --> 1:49:27.880]  Yes, sir, alec Jones. Good afternoon. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. Welcome
[1:49:28.920 --> 1:49:29.960]  Yes, sir
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:35.640]  So I've been listening to your shows since uh, I want to say back when I was like a fourth fifth grade back when you were selling the
[1:49:35.640 --> 1:49:40.520]  Burkey light the tea tree oil talking about uh old school stuff their brother
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:46.680]  I remember the bh tapes and uh the corner stores and stuff like that, but that's right. So you've been listening since the mid 90s
[1:49:47.720 --> 1:49:56.360]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Mid mid 90s late 90s and everything and uh, so i'm a i'm an disabled veteran and uh, I was in the army for a few years
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:57.720]  They sent me uh
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:02.840]  Over to afghanistan and all that I recall the injections they used to inject me with and everything and uh
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:07.160]  All of a sudden I'm hitting 70 push-ups out stopping 80 push-ups out stopping
[1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:13.160]  I'm all of a sudden going into the 90s and uh hitting 105 110 push-ups without stopping
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:19.560]  Same thing with the setups. I'm hitting like five six minute one miles and stuff like that and uh
[1:50:20.200 --> 1:50:22.600]  It all it all came down to these injections brother
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:29.960]  I was gonna ask, you know, if if you might have heard something like that about uh, maybe some uh experimental injections and everything that they might have
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:38.920]  Uh, yeah, no, it's on record that any captured population poor whites in appalachia black people in the south and the us military
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:45.480]  Gets all this stuff tested on them. And so there's all sorts of programs thousands of known programs
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:51.000]  Secret programs that have been declassified, uh, where they tested things on you
[1:50:52.680 --> 1:50:54.920]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You got put in a
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:51:01.480]  Super soldier program, you know, a lot of folks get put in a death shot program to see about, you know, how they can hurt people
[1:51:01.720 --> 1:51:05.640]  But I imagine the side effects probably weren't great, but it sounds like you were probably uh,
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:08.440]  I mean, have you seen, um
[1:51:09.400 --> 1:51:11.400]  The born supremacy
[1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:14.120]  Yes, sir. The uh, especially the uh, born legacy
[1:51:15.080 --> 1:51:19.400]  You're getting to the uh, the whole pill and all that. Well, they actually had that
[1:51:19.720 --> 1:51:23.400]  I mean, I've covered that 20 years ago and then that movie came out 10 years ago whenever dead
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:25.400]  They have viruses
[1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:30.200]  They can inject you that are programmed to only eat certain parts of the brain
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:35.640]  Where it gets rid of your inhibition. So like let's say I can bench press today
[1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:38.680]  This is my joints
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:41.400]  250 pounds I could bench press 400 pounds when I was in shape
[1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:43.960]  When I was, you know, 20 years old. I was super strong
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:46.760]  and
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:49.320]  But I have an inhibition
[1:51:49.320 --> 1:51:54.120]  Where you could really bench press three times what you think you can your body has a governor
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:52:00.680]  Well, they have viruses that go in and eat parts of the brain where the inhibition is taken away and if I had to guess
[1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:05.640]  Because if you took shots for a few years, they were training every day and you got stronger that'd be steroids
[1:52:05.800 --> 1:52:09.320]  But if it was small shots and all of a sudden you didn't care
[1:52:09.640 --> 1:52:14.920]  That was probably a viral reprogramming of the brain, which is the born legacy
[1:52:14.920 --> 1:52:19.320]  I forget well, what's the one where they give them the virus shots, which is real. That's actually a real program
[1:52:19.960 --> 1:52:23.000]  Uh, but but was it born supremacy or born legacy?
[1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:25.560]  Yes, the born legacy legacy
[1:52:26.040 --> 1:52:31.560]  They had a program where uh, they uh, had them had them on controlled had them on control these uh,
[1:52:31.720 --> 1:52:35.400]  Special pills that that they would take them. They didn't want to risk another born
[1:52:35.400 --> 1:52:37.400]  So they had more control with your special pills
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:41.240]  And uh, they were uh, you know, they were sent a virus
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:43.240]  Sure, sure. No, no, no
[1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:47.800]  If they didn't have the pills then they wouldn't have the that they wouldn't have the attribute anymore exactly
[1:52:47.960 --> 1:52:52.840]  It's a binary system. They wanted to be able to control them once they had uh reprogram their brain
[1:52:52.840 --> 1:52:55.640]  Yeah, well, that's all real science brother. God bless you and I appreciate your call
[1:52:57.080 --> 1:53:00.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to dr. Stewart in california dr. Stewart. Thanks for holding go ahead
[1:53:01.640 --> 1:53:05.000]  Yes, good morning. Uh, should I say well good morning? Uh, uh,
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:09.560]  Mr. Alex Jones. I have been a longtime supporter of yours. I
[1:53:09.560 --> 1:53:15.560]  support info wars and the various products that I receive continually
[1:53:16.120 --> 1:53:20.120]  But addressing what's going on right now, and I'm a veteran of the u.s. Coast Guard
[1:53:21.080 --> 1:53:23.080]  I work for the department of veterans affairs
[1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:26.200]  and currently under this
[1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:32.280]  dictatorship of denise mcdonald who's the secretary of uh, of um
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:37.800]  Department of veterans affairs and what's going on in our nation here right now
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  But all of what I'm looking at what's taking place because I'm drafting some
[1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:48.760]  Uh, uh, communication to go over to the long beach city council regarding militarizing the local police
[1:53:49.560 --> 1:53:57.000]  I look at there's a sundry of things that are happening with respect to what mr. Trump, uh, uh
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:53:59.800]  negated and uh
[1:54:00.360 --> 1:54:06.600]  Reputed the uh, the agreement that took place between cost school in the city of long beach
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:12.600]  allowing the communist party to come in and now we've got the militarization of the of the
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:14.920]  of the police force
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:20.280]  Who are they going to be waging war in the city of, uh, california and all this is under the guise of
[1:54:20.440 --> 1:54:24.120]  What had taken place by the approval of the the senate
[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:30.040]  The the legislature here in california and that was signed in the law by gavin newson
[1:54:30.040 --> 1:54:38.360]  Authorizing the local municipalities to purchase these military weapons right now. Now we hear
[1:54:39.480 --> 1:54:41.480]  What's being proposed right now?
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:44.040]  in in congress
[1:54:44.040 --> 1:54:46.040]  regarding
[1:54:46.040 --> 1:54:47.560]  giving
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:56.760]  Authority and removing and modifying the u.s. Constitution given and removing the authority and giving and allowing that to take place with the military
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:04.040]  Well, they took an oath and is they took an oath to uphold that constitution
[1:55:04.760 --> 1:55:09.000]  It's a violation of that constitution when we look at article one section eight
[1:55:09.720 --> 1:55:15.880]  To do anything other than that is now is now advocating another form of government with government
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:18.840]  Exactly. It is a new form of government. It is a coup
[1:55:19.720 --> 1:55:23.160]  Thank you for the call great points. All right. Let's go ahead take another call here
[1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:28.600]  Uh, let's go ahead and talk to flow joe in new jersey retired police officer on the
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:32.200]  Marshall law bill introduced by adam schiff go ahead
[1:55:33.800 --> 1:55:39.240]  Alex jones. I love you. I've been listening to you for many years. I was a police officer in new jersey
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:45.160]  Retired after being involved in the shooting and i'm now disabled retired police officer, but I have to say
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:51.720]  Uh, I have many plugs. I have almost every one of your supplements and products, but I can get to that at the end if we have time
[1:55:51.720 --> 1:55:53.240]  um
[1:55:53.240 --> 1:55:55.240]  bottom line is
[1:55:55.240 --> 1:55:58.840]  No matter if the bill or this latest claim from
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:03.560]  Our government saying that because of alex sign 99
[1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:10.520]  Supposedly stalking aoc. We should have more laws to protect politicians
[1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:14.920]  That's right now. You can't even talk. They say go harass supreme court justices
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:17.880]  They say harass us at our homes our businesses
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:24.040]  And at the gas station and grocery store, but you can't then talk to her on the street
[1:56:25.880 --> 1:56:27.880]  Exactly and
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:32.840]  What I want to say and I think what everyone should start to understand no matter what side of the spectrum you're on
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:38.760]  Because I once was a democrat, but I was born into that otherwise. I wouldn't have been able to be a police officer
[1:56:39.240 --> 1:56:44.280]  Uh, now I see the world in a completely different way, but what everyone should understand is
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:49.480]  Laws mandates rules bills. It doesn't matter
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:55.560]  They are all nothing more than little tiny circumventions of the of the constitution
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:56:58.920]  Not one of
[1:56:58.920 --> 1:57:03.240]  I mean, I could name only a handful of laws that are actually constitutional
[1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:05.960]  Most of them 98 percent maybe
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:08.840]  Are unconstitutional if you really think about it
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:13.640]  And this is not something I understood when I was a police officer because I wasn't taught that
[1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:19.960]  Um, but you know, we don't need more laws more laws equals less freedom period
[1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:23.320]  We don't need more bill. There's already a law on the book
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:25.960]  against stalking
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:30.440]  a politician there's already laws on the books against ticketing outside of
[1:57:31.320 --> 1:57:36.840]  Uh, you're right. That's what they do is selectively enforce and I intend to go live tomorrow as I did last saturday at noon
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:42.200]  We're gonna get alex stein on the show tomorrow at noon to talk about it all. Thank you so much flow joe

[2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:07.560]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about alex jones for example
[2:00:12.280 --> 2:00:16.040]  Alex jones the foray conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[2:00:16.040 --> 2:00:18.040]  The
[2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:25.160]  Alex jones

[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:05.320]  You're gonna see some serious
[2:01:05.320 --> 2:01:11.800]  You know someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to america it'll come in the name of liberalism
[2:01:11.800 --> 2:01:13.800]  So
[2:01:17.320 --> 2:01:21.720]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not phased by gun control laws
[2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:25.160]  I happen to know this from personal experience
[2:01:27.080 --> 2:01:30.440]  All you gotta do is arm all your best. I don't think that
[2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:34.600]  That the you should look back and whine and belly ache
[2:01:34.600 --> 2:01:41.400]  Or try to hold somebody else. You'll leave for everything you did. Where's the beat? All right. What is the trilateral commission?
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:47.400]  An organization founded in 1973 by david rock. Well, you see what they're really up to
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:55.320]  Is a scheme to plant their own royal members in positions of power in this country to work to erase
[2:01:55.800 --> 2:02:04.040]  National boundaries and create an international community and in time bring about a one world government with david rockabeller
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:06.040]  Calling the shots
[2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:11.640]  as Oliver north's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the nicaraguan
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:13.800]  Contras is waged in washington
[2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:21.080]  Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if minna arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns
[2:02:21.240 --> 2:02:29.880]  To the u.s. Back country rebels it all begins in 1982 when this man adler barryman seal showed up in minna arkansas
[2:02:29.880 --> 2:02:36.120]  He used to smuggle drugs and he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine
[2:02:36.280 --> 2:02:41.000]  But last night in louisiana barry seals enemies caught up with him and killed him
[2:02:42.040 --> 2:02:46.440]  17 year old kevin irons and 16 year old don henry were struck by a train
[2:02:46.760 --> 2:02:52.200]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana the parents however
[2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:57.560]  disputed that claim the boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:03:04.360]  Shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane tears in the fabric indicate that don had been stabbed before
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:11.640]  He was run over by the train in light of this new evidence the grand jury changed this ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:15.720]  i'm scared of these people i'm very scared of them
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.400]  How you think the crack drop fits into the country we don't own any planes
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:30.600]  We don't own no ships. We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here
[2:03:30.760 --> 2:03:37.480]  I will tell you director dorge has a former los angeles police narcotics detective that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long
[2:03:39.880 --> 2:03:46.920]  Men who are working for the ca's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into los angeles that sparked the fact of it
[2:03:47.080 --> 2:03:52.040]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with george busch and when they come back they say the ends justify the means
[2:03:52.040 --> 2:03:59.080]  Sir the republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at meaner arkansas
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:03.800]  This base was set up by george busch and oliver north and uh the cia
[2:04:04.360 --> 2:04:10.200]  To help the iran contras and they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:12.600]  The sale in the united states
[2:04:12.840 --> 2:04:18.360]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the contras all of which was illegal as you know under the
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:24.440]  Lower night, but tell me did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:26.440]  We had nothing
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:31.160]  Zero to do with it and everybody who's ever looked into it knows that

[2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:53.320]  Think about them saying you're non-essential

[2:07:24.040 --> 2:07:30.040]  Well, a lot of people probably remember seeing on the news. It was may of 2020 so back when lockdowns were fresh
[2:07:30.440 --> 2:07:35.080]  We were six weeks in as you recall it was two weeks to flatten the curve and two weeks and two weeks
[2:07:35.640 --> 2:07:40.760]  And at the six week mark I had reached my breaking limit. My husband and I had six businesses
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:44.280]  We were going to probably be bankrupt if it continued
[2:07:44.840 --> 2:07:50.600]  And so on may 5th of 2020. I was probably the second american to defy lockdowns
[2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:53.560]  I opened up against the lockdowns publicly
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:55.560]  and
[2:07:55.560 --> 2:08:00.680]  In doing so, I I triggered kate brown the wrath of democratic governor kate brown
[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:03.400]  She weaponized state agencies against me
[2:08:03.960 --> 2:08:07.560]  Including cps. She sends child protective services after my kids
[2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:13.720]  They illegally interviewed my children searched my home. I was threatened with um classy misdemeanor
[2:08:14.440 --> 2:08:18.360]  $50,000 a fines. I received a $14,000 osha citation
[2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:22.040]  Um, basically all the things for not complying
[2:08:22.120 --> 2:08:27.720]  It was let's make an example out of this woman and and teach everyone to sit down shut up and do as they're told
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:35.400]  And then now the aftermath continues on the aftermath continues, uh, they created a monster
[2:08:35.400 --> 2:08:40.360]  I ended up closing my business due to cancel culture. We sold our
[2:08:41.080 --> 2:08:43.560]  Other businesses. We moved out of oregon to arizona
[2:08:44.200 --> 2:08:48.840]  And I am now a full-time podcast host for the patriot barbie podcast
[2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.280]  I wrote a book about my experiences fighting the government cancel culture
[2:08:52.920 --> 2:08:59.080]  And um, just a very staunch ally for other conservatives patriots and speaking up for freedoms
[2:08:59.080 --> 2:09:05.560]  Um, it's been life-changing to say the least, but 100 percent worth the glory of laying
[2:09:06.040 --> 2:09:08.520]  Laying my head down at night knowing I stood up for what was right
[2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:11.160]  But they're currently trying to take a bunch of stuff away from me
[2:09:12.040 --> 2:09:14.040]  They are currently trying to
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:19.720]  Garnish my bank accounts and put a lien on my home for the $14,000 citation, which I refuse to pay
[2:09:20.120 --> 2:09:22.680]  They're charging me 9 interest on that citation
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:28.120]  Until I pay it. I have on record on recording the osha panel
[2:09:28.120 --> 2:09:34.520]  Stating that they do not have a document in their file that can prove that I had employees at my salon
[2:09:34.520 --> 2:09:36.520]  Which is the basis for the citation
[2:09:37.080 --> 2:09:42.040]  Um, however, they refuse to drop it and are now trying to put a lien on my home
[2:09:42.520 --> 2:09:48.600]  Unless I pay that as of I think so they let armed robbers and over 800 jurisdictions run by jord sorrow
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:50.440]  So the district attorneys
[2:09:50.440 --> 2:09:53.400]  Out of jail the next day. They had a guy shoot three kids at a school
[2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:59.720]  This year in in Dallas or it was in between Fort Worth and Dallas and they just let him go the next day
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:02.360]  So they let people that shoot people loose
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:08.840]  But then you wouldn't close down. So now you've got to have everything taken away from me. Yeah lost lost six businesses
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:15.080]  I had to close my 25, um chair salon and actually the city of Salem is trying to come after me for
[2:10:15.640 --> 2:10:21.720]  $80,000 for the lease due on the salon that I no longer own because of lockdowns
[2:10:21.720 --> 2:10:23.720]  That's the great reset, isn't it?
[2:10:24.760 --> 2:10:27.720]  Yes. Yeah, I'm I'm a big part of it
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:34.040]  What do you make of all the just where we're at right now? They're they're in the news saying they want new lockdowns
[2:10:34.360 --> 2:10:39.960]  Um, I I would encourage people not to comply with that. I will say that even
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:42.440]  Despite losing what I've lost
[2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:48.040]  Doing what's right is more important right now and fighting for this country and fighting for our freedoms is way more important
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:52.520]  Um than any money monetary value. Um any business whatsoever
[2:10:53.240 --> 2:10:59.640]  We have slipped a slippery slope the last two years and you know, my breaking point was being shut down for six weeks
[2:11:00.120 --> 2:11:04.600]  Other people have reached breaking points with vaccine mandates mask mandates things like that
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:09.240]  The there can't be many more breaking points before we need the entire
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:13.960]  United States to stand up and say we the people have had enough
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:18.520]  And then of course a light foot in the middle of all this two years ago said well, I'm important
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:23.480]  I still get my hair cut and so did Pelosi. I mean, it's just next level. Yeah
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:28.520]  There was hypocrisy from the very beginning, which is another reason. I was comfortable opening up
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:33.880]  Um, I wasn't political. I wasn't doing my research. I didn't know much about covet. I didn't care to be honest
[2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:40.600]  I basically had decided well if walmart can be open and home depot can be open and there's hundreds of people in there
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:47.000]  I know that it's not about safety. I think that it's about compliance and this is me getting redpilled in my own world
[2:11:47.000 --> 2:11:52.600]  Yeah, it's big corporations shutting down the competition. Yeah, so opening up was not controversial to me
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:56.920]  I knew that it wasn't about our safety and it took me some time to figure out what it really was about compliance and
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:03.080]  Obedience, but you know against the mandates I opened and I never enforced masks in my business
[2:12:03.160 --> 2:12:09.080]  We had thousands of people as you can imagine coming through and we have had and we had no covid cases
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:12.360]  Not one no stylist. No client. Why were you forced to shut down?
[2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:15.400]  Uh, to quote flatten the curve
[2:12:16.200 --> 2:12:19.480]  No, I know but like once you you refuse to comply you had to shut the salon
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:24.440]  I would imagine all the other salons are shut down. I had people coming here to the office for a year to just you know
[2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:27.080]  Cut my hair literally sitting around over there in a chair
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:33.800]  What happened there wasn't no funds coming in. No, there was funds coming in a lot of people donated, which I was thankful for
[2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:37.480]  Um, blm when the george floyd writes all you're saying you got harass
[2:12:37.480 --> 2:12:42.840]  Oh, I got cancelled cultured to the extreme. Yeah, that is what cost me my six business
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:44.840]  I love how antifa and blm
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:49.160]  Go out and harass people trying to open their business. What does that have to do with black lives matter?
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:50.120]  It's just crazy
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:56.040]  Well, their rationality was and they had no problem telling me this directly was that I cared more about money than black lives
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:01.000]  And that if I didn't allow them to burn down my salon as they were stating they were going to do
[2:13:01.400 --> 2:13:05.400]  Then I didn't care about black lives when I could simply file an insurance claim. So
[2:13:05.400 --> 2:13:09.080]  The intention was the idea was that they had the right
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:11.720]  to burn down my salon
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:13.880]  Because I was killing people by being open
[2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:16.840]  So I did a cold arms
[2:13:17.080 --> 2:13:19.080]  The news did not cover this
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:23.080]  400 patriots showed up outside my salon in Salem, Oregon
[2:13:23.880 --> 2:13:27.560]  proud boys three percenters veterans ex-military
[2:13:28.120 --> 2:13:31.080]  And we protected the entire city of downtown Salem
[2:13:31.080 --> 2:13:35.640]  And no shots were fired. No windows were broken. Nothing was stolen
[2:13:36.440 --> 2:13:41.160]  And someone from the police department called me and said I'll never go on record saying this
[2:13:41.400 --> 2:13:43.400]  But if you hadn't called arms
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:45.480]  Salem would look like portland, Oregon
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:47.880]  And we saved the city
[2:13:48.440 --> 2:13:49.960]  Wow
[2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:56.600]  Are you horrified like I am that they're openly saying new lockdowns new new hysteria coming. I mean, they're really pushing that
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:14:01.480]  Um, is that have something to do with trump running thinking about running again exactly. Yeah, okay
[2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:07.240]  I'm not surprised. I mean, I think the first round was a test. I think we failed miserably
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:12.520]  My hope and prayer would be that americans learn a very valuable lesson in 2020
[2:14:13.080 --> 2:14:16.920]  The government will lie even if you don't believe that covet was a lie
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:22.280]  Two weeks to flatten the curve was a lie and they didn't have any problem hiding that they will not
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:24.360]  cease
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:30.520]  To demand your compliance whenever they feel like it it's a cult of control a cult of compliance and
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:33.560]  Now we have
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:37.720]  The democrats introducing a bill to have the u.s. Military operate domestically with no oversight
[2:14:38.120 --> 2:14:40.680]  Talk about washing their hands. Talk about get ready for martial law
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:46.520]  The definition of martial law is a military standing outside of law. That's like the worst form of it
[2:14:47.080 --> 2:14:48.600]  well, and
[2:14:48.600 --> 2:14:52.360]  If we continue to comply which we've gotten ourselves into this mess
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:55.480]  By complying the first round by complying the last two years
[2:14:56.280 --> 2:14:58.280]  Masking up by taking the vaccine
[2:14:58.520 --> 2:15:01.400]  They know where to hit us and and they're looking for our weak spots
[2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:06.440]  And for me, you know, my weak spot was saying that I was reopening because I had a right to provide for my kids
[2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:09.800]  Well, the next day child protective services showed up. But what does that tell you?
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:14.200]  They are looking for our weak spots and when they enforced
[2:15:14.840 --> 2:15:20.680]  Vaccine mandates and people knew I can't afford to lose my job. That's my weak spot. I'm going to comply
[2:15:20.680 --> 2:15:24.120]  They're testing the waters and again, we are failing
[2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:30.680]  And if we continue to fail and refuse to stand up for our own rights our own freedoms and green lights their takeover
[2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.440]  It does. Yep
[2:15:32.440 --> 2:15:34.600]  It does. All right, lizzie gramm stay there
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:39.800]  I want to get your take on how we fight back your book and so much more and then if you're good to do it
[2:15:39.960 --> 2:15:44.280]  We got some callers about the martial law legislation. You want to talk to those folks? Sure
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:48.360]  All right, we got callers coming up and and not just the callers on there
[2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:55.800]  We're gonna open the phones up a free for all any topic. You want to discuss eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:15:59.800]  There is nothing there is no more
[2:16:00.360 --> 2:16:03.240]  epitome of free speech than right here
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:07.240]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with
[2:16:08.040 --> 2:16:10.040]  And as word said, you're not going to find a better place

[2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:40.120]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks. This is this is a joke
[2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:43.560]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75 off by the way
[2:16:43.560 --> 2:16:49.080]  It works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working for me
[2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:50.760]  Quite well
[2:16:50.760 --> 2:16:57.320]  I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now
[2:16:58.120 --> 2:17:02.040]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[2:17:02.760 --> 2:17:04.760]  Of the planet's ruling class
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.480]  Not in communist china not in mexico
[2:17:08.040 --> 2:17:10.040]  Not in the united states not anywhere
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:12.680]  Is there a real study
[2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:15.240]  Of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design
[2:17:16.040 --> 2:17:21.320]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:24.840]  That look into say the anglo-american establishment
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:31.160]  The sound of the builder bird group the trilateral commission the united nations the whole project of the rock shawls and the rock folks
[2:17:31.960 --> 2:17:37.000]  Until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media of the builder bird group didn't exist
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:40.360]  Well, now the builder bird group is public and its former head

[2:19:56.280 --> 2:19:58.280]  First
[2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:04.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:20:16.760 --> 2:20:21.880]  Our revolutionary war in 1776 started for a lot of reasons done confiscation
[2:20:21.880 --> 2:20:29.400]  corrupt courts. But the big one was taxation without representation. And the power to tax
[2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:33.720]  is the power to destroy. Well, if you can say your business is not essential and it's
[2:20:33.720 --> 2:20:38.700]  shut down, that's the ultimate tax. That's siege. That's not letting you live. It's trying
[2:20:38.700 --> 2:20:44.640]  to make you dependent. And Lindsey Graham, it was a salon owner in Oregon who stood up
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:51.720]  and was attacked and shut down by a mob of criminals. And now they're trying to take
[2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:56.840]  everything she's got because she dared stand up to them. What a group of bullies. What
[2:20:56.840 --> 2:21:00.860]  a group of criminals. We have a totally open border. Illegals pouring across devalued
[2:21:00.860 --> 2:21:05.640]  currencies. All these crimes being committed and they're targeting you to send you a message
[2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:11.360]  of submission. What a cult. I will not comply. In fact, I'm excited to announce that next
[2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:17.840]  week I will be filing a lawsuit against Kate Brown in her individual and official capacity
[2:21:17.840 --> 2:21:23.120]  and all of the state agencies that have targeted me. So they will, they will not get away with
[2:21:23.120 --> 2:21:26.120]  doing what they're doing to the American people. Well, a lot of folks are going to say, why
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:30.440]  do we care about Oregon? It's the same globalist running it everywhere. It's the same program.
[2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:34.240]  If it can happen to you, it can happen to us. Well, and we see people fleeing Oregon now
[2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:38.960]  because they've destroyed it. There's homelessness, running rampant. There's graffiti that the
[2:21:38.960 --> 2:21:43.200]  state is being destroyed from the inside out. People are fleeing. Well, if they take those
[2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:47.000]  politics with them to other states, you've got a virus that's spreading all over the
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:52.080]  US. No one is safe. They keep saying Arizona, which is where I live now is purple. Well,
[2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:57.640]  it's very, very red. We all know there's election fraud. But if you've got this virus spreading
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:02.680]  all over the US, then we are all going to be looking at states in which authority figures
[2:22:02.680 --> 2:22:08.640]  have the capacity to do what they did to me and to make you suffer if you do not obey.
[2:22:08.640 --> 2:22:15.560]  And that is very, very scary. How do we find back? We go on Alex Jones show and we speak
[2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:23.000]  up. I think we all need to take a good look at our lives and what we own, what we have,
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:29.240]  what we possess and decide for yourself now before your face with it. What your, what
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:33.120]  your, where the line is drawn for you. You should be organizing local businesses now
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:37.200]  against the new lockdowns. Yes, absolutely. You know what? And I had this idea when I
[2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:43.080]  had reopened, no one opened up with me that there would be a foundation where every business
[2:22:43.080 --> 2:22:46.520]  that said, I'm going to make a commitment and I'm going to sign a contract to defy these
[2:22:46.520 --> 2:22:51.680]  lockdowns. This is my membership fee and they're going to target more people that they can't
[2:22:51.680 --> 2:22:55.640]  pick you off. That's right. And then if you do get picked off, you've got already the
[2:22:55.640 --> 2:23:00.480]  funds that your fellow business owners have collaborated to get for you to help you fight
[2:23:00.480 --> 2:23:05.160]  to a business owner union. Yes. And if they're going to do this again, it was too late for
[2:23:05.160 --> 2:23:09.040]  me. It was, I had already opened, I'd already defied, took on the government. But if they're
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:14.000]  going to threaten this again, we can activate now and business owners can start communicating
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:19.000]  and start donating to an organization, a foundation where they can support each other and say,
[2:23:19.000 --> 2:23:23.520]  listen, if you're the one that gets picked out of the group to get harassed and targeted
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:26.360]  by the government, we're going to, we're going to have your back financially. We're going
[2:23:26.360 --> 2:23:30.120]  to have your back emotionally and we're going to support you as being the one that's taking
[2:23:30.120 --> 2:23:31.120]  the hit for us.
[2:23:31.120 --> 2:23:35.480]  Well, that's what listeners have done for us and it's been great. We've stayed on air,
[2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:40.680]  but now it's enraged the system. They just keep doubling down, but if there's more targets,
[2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:45.200]  they can't beat us all. Right. And they're trying to not only shut us down, but just
[2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:49.600]  make everything harder. Everything's harder for a conservative. If you're de-platformed,
[2:23:49.600 --> 2:23:54.800]  if your followers are erased, you have to waste your time rebuilding that support system.
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:23:59.240]  And so they're effectively slowing us down. But if we continue, eventually they're going
[2:23:59.240 --> 2:24:02.440]  to get worn out and we're just going to keep persevering. I know people that have had their
[2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:06.480]  accounts deleted, you know, three, four times and they get back up on the horse and rebuild.
[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:10.080]  That's exhausting. But eventually they're going to get tired and realize we're not quitting.
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:12.960]  I'm going to, we're going to fight back as long as it takes. I'm not willing to give
[2:24:12.960 --> 2:24:13.960]  up any freedoms.
[2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:18.680]  Well, let me expand on that. On Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, all these places they censor
[2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:23.000]  our information, other people just keep popping up and even though they get deleted a month
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:27.680]  or a week, it goes viral before they stop them. People are really hungry. So they're
[2:24:27.680 --> 2:24:30.240]  suppressing, but it makes it that much more desirable.
[2:24:30.240 --> 2:24:34.000]  Yeah. The information is getting out there. You've got to get it out there quickly before
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:38.920]  they find it. But I think if we just keep persevering, they can't silence all of us.
[2:24:38.920 --> 2:24:39.920]  They can try, but they can't.
[2:24:39.920 --> 2:24:44.600]  Let me ask you this question, Lindsey Graham, the, uh, Patriot Barbie, patreon Barbie.com.
[2:24:44.600 --> 2:24:50.200]  So we're going to call her here, Jim, in a moment, Jim in New Jersey, is America over?
[2:24:50.200 --> 2:24:55.360]  I think it's over if we roll over. It's not over if we say no to them.
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:25:00.240]  I agree. It's a scary question to wonder. Have we, have we reached rock bottom? Is this
[2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:04.520]  it? But I don't think it's it. I think that they're going to continue to test us.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:08.480]  Um, and exactly, we can't give up because there's no bottom. I mean, they're not going
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:11.480]  to ever stop. Even though we're crazy, no, and we're not going to stop either. We're
[2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:16.960]  talking about a situation where it could be holocaustic, right? At what point do you comply
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:20.480]  with being shipped off to a camp? I mean, we are going to fight them. I know there are
[2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:25.120]  plenty of people that are going to fight to the very, very end, whatever that looks like.
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:29.000]  And I think everyone needs to get that in their brains that this is not going to stop.
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:33.240]  So you better start figuring out what your role in this is now beautifully said. They
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:37.640]  are introducing us to martial law and the long night, long dark night of turning right
[2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:45.120]  now. Jim in New Jersey is America over? What is rock bottom? What needs to happen? Go ahead.
[2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:49.960]  We have to decide that we've hit rock bottom because the reality of we can go down further.
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:57.280]  But most people don't do anything until they hit rock bottom to start building back up.
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:05.000]  We have to all realize that it's only going to get worse from here. We've got to start
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:10.600]  fighting back. I mean, the government, they think they're so stupid. They give you a public
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:16.240]  service announcement that if you don't take the COVID jab, you're going to have a bad
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:19.920]  time. You may die of COVID, but then they give you a public service announcement to
[2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:25.800]  say that you could survive a nuclear attack. It's so ridiculous because nothing in that
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:30.800]  public service announcement out in New York, I live in New Jersey, said, you know, any
[2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:35.840]  statistics of you surviving, they didn't say if you should survive, this is what you should
[2:26:35.840 --> 2:26:40.560]  do. We didn't even say that the government was going to help you, but they're trying
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:45.640]  to get you to take a shot because you've got to be afraid of COVID. But you got this.
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:52.440]  If we get hit with a nuclear bomb, just go inside your house. You'll be fine. You know,
[2:26:52.440 --> 2:26:58.080]  they've been dumbing us down. I have a son that was born in 88, a daughter named Lindsay
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:03.600]  spelt the same way as you in 90. And I've been telling them since the early 90s with
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:09.640]  television, this is the dumbing down of America. You continue to see it. It's been in our faces
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:18.520]  for 30 years. So are your children going, wow, dad was right? Of course they're like,
[2:27:18.520 --> 2:27:23.960]  you know, I didn't have older particulars, but you know, I can certainly see the stuff
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:28.720]  that was going on. I mean, this is just dumbing down. It's like, in the, they're telling you
[2:27:28.720 --> 2:27:34.080]  exact opposite of what you should, you know, what is true. I mean, it's, and they expect
[2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:38.000]  you to believe it. I mean, just like I said, they're getting expecting you to believe that
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:46.840]  you can survive a nuclear attack, but you can't survive COVID unless you get that jab.
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:51.720]  They think we're so stupid. And the Marshall laws coming in, one of the reasons why the
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:55.040]  Marshall laws coming in numbers, I have a feeling you're going to do away with jury
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:28:00.520]  trials because they, they, they can't, they can't take the chances on the people siding
[2:28:00.520 --> 2:28:05.120]  with the people. So eventually jury trials are going to go to the side. The other thing
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.800]  too is that they expect, I think it was Marshall law comes in, they don't, I think that a lot
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:15.760]  of people are not going to comply a second time and they're going to force them to comply.
[2:28:15.760 --> 2:28:18.360]  That's one of the other things I think they absolutely right. I mean, that's why in these
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:22.720]  cases against me, they've defaulted me saying he gave us nothing. We gave him everything
[2:28:22.720 --> 2:28:26.200]  did it all. And they go, Oh, you're guilty. Now we're going to have a jury trial on how
[2:28:26.200 --> 2:28:31.520]  much money you pay. It's just insane. All right, brother.
[2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:35.560]  Well, you're doing what's right. Honestly, when, when we talk about calls to action,
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:39.360]  you are doing what's, what's right. You're teaching your kids because we are all going
[2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:44.280]  to die, probably not of COVID. And your kids need to know the truth and they need to know
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:48.040]  how to speak it boldly. And with Senator Graham, stay there.
[2:28:48.040 --> 2:28:57.640]  We'll be right back. Ladies and gentlemen, more phone calls and Senator Lindsey Graham.
[2:28:57.640 --> 2:29:03.720]  One month ago in December of 2021, we launched the first three-coin founding member series,
[2:29:03.720 --> 2:29:08.960]  George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally

[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:36.880]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:32:36.880 --> 2:33:04.400]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:33:30.400 --> 2:33:36.800]  in Ukraine and it happens to be one of our best foundations.
[2:33:36.800 --> 2:33:50.600]  They refuse to live and they are leading civil society.
[2:33:50.600 --> 2:34:01.880]  I also want to mention that there is one person who was very deeply involved in Ukraine and
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:13.600]  that's Biden. In fact, I got to know him with regard to Ukraine. He had a lot more patience
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:24.240]  than I had in trying to convert Poroshenko into a democratic leader. I fed up with him
[2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:39.640]  and I told him so, but actually Biden kept on trying to convert Poroshenko into a democrat.
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:47.160]  Professor, to take a moment to offer my personal congratulations to you on this, the 40th annual
[2:34:47.160 --> 2:34:54.040]  gathering of your creation, the World Economic Forum. You chose, as its motto, committed
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:34:59.760]  to improving the state of the world. I would observe that few who have set such a lofty
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:05.680]  goal have more reason to be pleased with their accomplishments, to have conceived of the
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:12.400]  need for such an institution as this, required insight, to have established it took commitment,
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:16.360]  but to have then nurtured it as a podium from which business and political leaders could
[2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:22.480]  nudge public policy by addressing their peers from around the world. That is a formidable
[2:35:22.480 --> 2:35:26.480]  achievement and, Professor, this gathering can salute you.
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:31.720]  That's the former prime minister of Canada, Stephen Harbour, praising Klaus Schwab, Lindsey
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:37.280]  Graham, not the senator I was talking about earlier, but the patriot, Barbie, who had her
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:41.720]  salon shut down. She refused to shut down. They said BLM shut it down. She's out moved
[2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:50.520]  from Oregon to Arizona and she's here visiting us today. She'll be on 4 p.m. also today on
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:35:54.120]  the war rooms that's coming up in a couple hours. I want to go back to some more phone
[2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:59.200]  calls from Tito and others, just talking about this great tyranny and people from other countries
[2:35:59.200 --> 2:36:03.240]  that have seen their nations go down the tubes and now see America go down the tubes. But
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:05.480]  what are other things you'd like to add to the audience?
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:09.320]  Oh, I would love to tell people how I became the patriot, Barbie, because I always think
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:14.640]  it's such a kind of vain term. But when cancel culture came for me and decided that I was
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:19.520]  this raging conservative Trump supporter just for wanting to open my business, they took
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:24.800]  a picture of me wearing a MAGA hat and said, I don't always play patriot, Barbie, but when
[2:36:24.800 --> 2:36:31.360]  I do, I kill people's grandmas and steal their money. And I had been so sick to death of
[2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:36.280]  the left coming at me and trying to cancel me that I changed my Facebook page to say
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:42.520]  patriot, Barbie, and they lost their minds. So now it's so you took that attack and I
[2:36:42.520 --> 2:36:45.680]  turned it right on its head. I took, I took everything. I took every attack and turned
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:50.320]  it on its head. And it's like the British called Northerners Yankee doodle dandies, which
[2:36:50.320 --> 2:36:55.840]  means like goofy, wimp, gay dudes. So they should have called themselves the hour Yankees.
[2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:01.000]  That's what you got to do. Laugh with them. They're trying so hard to get out and hurt
[2:37:01.000 --> 2:37:07.320]  us. And the less that we give them that ability, that's our fight. Our fight is that we they
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:15.600]  don't identify us. They don't they don't define us. What we do in the in the in the privacy
[2:37:15.600 --> 2:37:20.360]  of our homes and what we do for this fight is what's right. And no, no amount of name
[2:37:20.360 --> 2:37:26.800]  calling is ever going to silence me again. So they've unleashed the Kraken, the fury
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:33.700]  of the Patriot Barbie. Yes. It's it's an honor to be a conservative activist. I was not political
[2:37:33.700 --> 2:37:38.760]  before lockdowns. And I actually don't even know if I consider myself political. Now I
[2:37:38.760 --> 2:37:44.000]  just see that there's social and cultural issues. I'm a mom. I want to leave a beautiful
[2:37:44.000 --> 2:37:50.040]  America for my kids. I want my kids to not be brainwashed sheep. And that's what we need
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:54.960]  to be doing is is training up the next generation to they're going to need to fight this too.
[2:37:54.960 --> 2:38:02.720]  This isn't going to go away overnight. And it's not going to go away anytime soon. Targeted.
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:07.920]  Mom's fight for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Targeted by tyranny. I've read
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:11.600]  your book. I'm going to read it this weekend. Tell us about your book. So the book was very
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:16.880]  distinctly a calling from God to sit down and write what had happened to me because
[2:38:16.880 --> 2:38:21.520]  it was it's such a unique story. And and and it's like I'm telling someone else's story
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:25.920]  when I say that not very many people went through what those of us who stood up against
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:32.040]  lockdowns did. And as I sat down to write, I realized that I have had a colorful life.
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:38.280]  I've made I've made some pretty bad choices in my youth. And my faith in God says that
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:42.600]  God turns all things to good. And we know that. And I lost everything in this fight.
[2:38:42.600 --> 2:38:47.880]  Everything of monetary value, if you will, the businesses, the home. And I've been put
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:54.320]  on a purpose that I believe is much, much bigger than hair extensions and being. Yes,
[2:38:54.320 --> 2:38:58.480]  you're more fulfilled now than ever. I'm more fulfilled now than ever. Absolutely. And
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:02.400]  that book is is a compilation of what what has God allowed me to go through in my life
[2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:07.400]  that has made me prepared for this fight. And it's not easy. It's every day it's a struggle
[2:39:07.400 --> 2:39:11.880]  and it's a commitment. And I believe that he's taking all of the things that I did in
[2:39:11.880 --> 2:39:16.280]  my youth, those bad decisions, turning them into good. And he said, look, I let you go
[2:39:16.280 --> 2:39:21.000]  through these so that you could be this person. Exactly. Let's talk to a caller in California,
[2:39:21.000 --> 2:39:25.480]  Tito, you're on the air with the Patriot Barbie. Go ahead, Tito. What is your view? You're
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:28.960]  an immigrant from Nicaragua. Give us your take on what you witnessed in communism.
[2:39:28.960 --> 2:39:36.520]  Yes, yes, I was born in Caragua in the 80s, and I came here to US in the early 90s. My
[2:39:36.520 --> 2:39:40.200]  mom migrated here. Thank God, I didn't have to go through crossing the border on all that.
[2:39:40.200 --> 2:39:44.520]  I had a visa. Thank God. But I just wanted to reach out to you. Just first of all, I
[2:39:44.520 --> 2:39:48.920]  want to say thank you for everything you do. I got introduced to you when Trump was running.
[2:39:48.920 --> 2:39:54.120]  But I want to just give an idea to you if you can have a show or a segment of having
[2:39:54.120 --> 2:39:58.600]  Latinos, you know, because a lot of us are waking up, you know, we were, but we need
[2:39:58.600 --> 2:40:02.040]  more guidance, you know, and kind of like, Hey, a lot of people want to stay in the closet
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:05.800]  in the but, you know, they have the same views that we have, but, you know, they're afraid
[2:40:05.800 --> 2:40:11.400]  to have come out because they feel alone. So it'll be awesome to have some Latinos in
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:16.160]  your shows, reach out to them. I know there's Lexic in California. I'm not sure if you heard
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:22.360]  them like, you know, exiting the Democratic Party. But just, yeah, being a growing up
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:27.080]  in Nicaragua, you know, it's the stocks, you know, the whole war happened in the 80s,
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:31.320]  you know, coming to the United States is a beautiful country. I mean, it's the dream,
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:35.560]  you know, the dream being here and people don't take that. They take advantage of it in the wrong
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:39.880]  way, you know, but I just want to say thank you for all you do. God bless you. But you were,
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:46.360]  I see the text you told the call answer, the call screener about the paradox of seeing what
[2:40:46.360 --> 2:40:53.000]  tyranny is like and then seeing it now here. Yes. Yes. And I see that's the thing that's
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:40:57.800]  been being born here and not not being seeing the communists and how that works. You don't
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:01.480]  have, you have no idea. You want to see what the news is telling you, but to actually have
[2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:05.640]  family that are being born there and actually experiencing it for yourself, you see very
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:09.880]  differently. And as much as you tell people, Hey, this is coming, this is coming, they don't
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:14.200]  believe it until they actually hear. And then when it's here, it might be a little too late,
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:17.960]  you know, so please, please people out there, listen to the people that are telling you that
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:22.680]  they come from this country. You know, we're not just saying, I just say, I mean, we experienced
[2:41:22.680 --> 2:41:26.280]  it. You know, I said how family over there that anytime they want to send up to the government,
[2:41:26.280 --> 2:41:29.960]  they have rocks and machetes and that's it. But the government responsible guns and that's it
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:36.120]  only lasts that day or two. Powerfully said, Tito. Thank you for calling today. What do you think
[2:41:36.120 --> 2:41:40.280]  of Trump announcing he's going to run for president? Did he actually do it? Well, he said,
[2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:44.680]  I'm going to run. I'm not going to say when I'm going to announce the same thing. Okay. He said,
[2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:49.000]  I've made up my mind, right? I've made it my mind to run the question. My mind to run. I think
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:54.600]  that's amazing. I miss Trump terribly. I'm very, very excited to see him back in office. If we can
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:42:01.240]  get the elections under control, and then there is no way he won't win. He would have won. He did
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:05.400]  win this last time. It's going to be a landslide this. Well, absolutely. But I mean, I talked to
[2:42:05.400 --> 2:42:08.680]  Roger Stone, a bunch of folks that talked to Trump, he said he was going to announce in July.
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:12.520]  People are like, Oh, it's not going to happen. No, he said, I'm going to run, not just sure when
[2:42:12.520 --> 2:42:15.640]  I'm going to announce, but that's like, you're announcing, you're announcing that you're going
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:20.920]  to announce. Yeah, because I'm going to run. I've made up my mind. I think he, I think he likes to
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:25.640]  play with the media because if you take that headline all on its own, it's like, I'm announcing,
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:29.320]  but I'm not announcing because then they can't run a story that he's announcing. I think he's,
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:32.360]  I think he's toying with that. He's getting announcements over and over. Oh, he's, yeah,
[2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:35.880]  and he's getting the media over and over again, and they don't know what to do with him and his
[2:42:35.880 --> 2:42:40.120]  play on words and, and where's the official announcement from the 45th president of the
[2:42:40.120 --> 2:42:43.800]  United States? I think, I think it's amazing that he messes with the media the way he does. They
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:48.840]  deserve it. All right, Lindsey Graham, I've always wanted to debate Lindsey Graham. What's debate?
[2:42:49.960 --> 2:42:54.280]  Oh, you're the wrong Lindsey Graham. You are a lot better looking than Lindsey Graham. We'll be right

[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:07.560]  I want to say Brain Force is great. I want to say Turbo Force is amazing. It is. But if you took it
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:13.800]  with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it and that's an example
[2:45:13.800 --> 2:45:19.960]  of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best
[2:45:19.960 --> 2:45:24.680]  out there. Crill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry. You want something
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:29.160]  like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. It might be.
[2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:32.200]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five
[2:45:32.200 --> 2:45:35.960]  capillots of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:45:37.640 --> 2:45:42.360]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:45:45.160 --> 2:45:49.240]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best
[2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:53.240]  is with God, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it. Import store.
[2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:04.600]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:09.400]  what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better
[2:46:09.400 --> 2:46:13.880]  place for information. You might not agree with everything. You might not agree with all our
[2:46:13.880 --> 2:46:18.600]  perspectives, but we cover all the information and there's nowhere else really that does it
[2:46:18.600 --> 2:46:23.160]  like we do here. Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he
[2:46:23.160 --> 2:46:27.800]  mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to get them folks. And we do have the best supplements. I mean,
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:34.520]  just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[2:46:34.520 --> 2:46:39.960]  supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula. Folks, this is a joke.
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:44.840]  I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:52.440]  noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well,
[2:46:52.440 --> 2:47:18.680]  my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see him quite often now.
[2:47:24.520 --> 2:47:26.600]  Jay, all of you that have been holding, I'm going to get to you.
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:31.160]  It's the Alex Jones Show, Patriot Barbies here in studio with us. Lindsay Graham,
[2:47:32.600 --> 2:47:39.560]  the Patriot mother, business shut down by the Communist in Oregon now living in Arizona,
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:44.600]  visiting us in Austin, Texas. And let's run through these phone calls right now.
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:51.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ruben in California. Ruben, you're on the air.
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:59.320]  Ruben, they say silence is golden. It really is. I appreciate your ribbon.
[2:48:00.040 --> 2:48:05.880]  All right, let's go. Oh, yes. Andrew in Toronto, Canada. Talk about tyranny.
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:10.680]  Justin Trudeau, go ahead. You're on the air. Andrew. Hey, Alex. I love what you do.
[2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:14.760]  Here's your God sent. I just wanted to touch briefly on like,
[2:48:15.800 --> 2:48:19.800]  at my experience of talking to friends and kind of, I guess, waiting them up or something.
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:25.000]  What seems to work really well is kind of group chats on signal and whatever.
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:30.520]  I had some kind of conservative-ish friends, like it was more or less political chat.
[2:48:31.880 --> 2:48:35.480]  And, you know, after, let's say, six months or something,
[2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:41.400]  there are pretty much all libertarian. They kind of get what the game is with the government and
[2:48:41.400 --> 2:48:47.000]  everything like that. And I think that's a good way to wake up kind of friends and family.
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:54.920]  I think it has to do with like the dialogue, the two-way of it rather than just, you know,
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:49:00.920]  shouting at them. I think you're right. What do you think about the announcements of
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:05.560]  the military to be outside of government and operate on its own? The Democrats introducing
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:13.080]  bills to eventually put in military dictatorship. I don't know what the implications of that is.
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:18.680]  I assume it's bad. I really don't know, though. All right, brother. I appreciate your call.
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:24.120]  You know, Lindsey, I don't see them doing all this as a sign of strength. I see it as a sign of
[2:49:24.120 --> 2:49:33.400]  weakness. Yeah, I see it as one more way to passive-aggressively threaten us. If we are so
[2:49:33.400 --> 2:49:39.160]  uncontrollable that they have to go straight to the military, first of all, good for us,
[2:49:40.040 --> 2:49:47.720]  we should be so non-compliant that they have to go that far to get the people to shut up and comply.
[2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:55.240]  But it's also terrifying. The more we speak up and stand up, the harder it's going to get.
[2:49:55.240 --> 2:49:57.000]  We got to be prepared for this. We knew it was coming.
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:02.520]  What do you make of the left that are having their own futures destroyed but pretend they're part of
[2:50:02.520 --> 2:50:09.400]  the power structure from social media, encouraging them, all of it? They have no idea of even what
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:14.280]  they're doing. I've been asking myself this. Like the mainstream news, these reporters that are,
[2:50:14.280 --> 2:50:19.960]  you know, refusing to report some things and twisting the rest, what do they think is going
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:25.560]  to happen when we are a socialist communist country? Do they think they are going to get
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:30.440]  an elite status and be above? Do they think that their children are going to get a free pass?
[2:50:30.440 --> 2:50:37.400]  Because they're not. They're not. You are sealing the fate, the demise of your own future. I can't
[2:50:37.400 --> 2:50:42.440]  imagine a world where I would be okay saying, well, eventually it's going to get really bad.
[2:50:42.440 --> 2:50:46.040]  I'll help and then I'll let my kids endure that wrath later.
[2:50:46.040 --> 2:50:51.720]  Absolutely. That's the big debate. Alex in North Carolina is a security clearance investigator
[2:50:51.720 --> 2:50:57.240]  for the DOD. Let's talk about corruption and this martial law legislation introduced by the
[2:50:57.240 --> 2:51:03.480]  Democrats. Thanks for holding Alex here on the air. Thank you, sir. 22 years long with you.
[2:51:04.360 --> 2:51:09.240]  Great that you're waking people up still and we're in the fight all together with this and
[2:51:09.240 --> 2:51:15.320]  we've got to keep going. One thing about the corruption I want to say is with the security
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:21.400]  clearance is this one I want to back this corruption on. These guys would not be in office if these
[2:51:21.400 --> 2:51:26.760]  investigators were doing their due diligence and not playing the games just because they were the
[2:51:26.760 --> 2:51:33.400]  title of a general or president or a private. They are not all the same and when they walk in the
[2:51:33.400 --> 2:51:40.680]  door and they walk in there and they see a general title general and assume that they've got a perfect
[2:51:42.040 --> 2:51:48.760]  background and no history to them and they write them off like it's no problem.
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:54.120]  Every one of them needs to be investigated properly. If they were done due diligently,
[2:51:54.760 --> 2:52:00.440]  these people like Adam Schiff with the Chinese spy and all these others that are in Congress and
[2:52:00.440 --> 2:52:08.200]  the Pentagon and the White House, including Hunter Biden, they wouldn't have these clearances.
[2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:12.600]  We wouldn't have the problems that we have right now. Well, that's right. They use security
[2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:17.400]  clearances to hold Trump up getting anybody when all these Democrats are literally selling the country
[2:52:17.400 --> 2:52:21.800]  out. Yeah, we have the resources but they're spending it on the wrong narrative.
[2:52:21.800 --> 2:52:31.720]  Right. And pulling in the military to come on to be on domestic territory is absolutely
[2:52:31.720 --> 2:52:35.480]  going to turn this into martial law. There's no doubt about it. That's what they're looking
[2:52:35.480 --> 2:52:39.320]  to do. They're going to reinforce their backup and that's going to be their backup.
[2:52:39.320 --> 2:52:46.440]  And what is the trigger though? A mass shooting, a power outage, a nuclear false flag?
[2:52:46.440 --> 2:52:52.680]  I mean, this is big stuff they're getting ready. Yeah, exactly. They're getting ready to do something
[2:52:52.680 --> 2:52:58.920]  very big and I believe it's going to be maybe like an October surprise or a dark winter that we've
[2:52:58.920 --> 2:53:05.880]  been hearing about so faithfully. And I believe that we've come to the fruition of being right here
[2:53:05.880 --> 2:53:10.920]  in it. We're in it right now and it's going to be exposed in front of us. And I don't know if it's
[2:53:10.920 --> 2:53:17.240]  going... I kind of feel like it's going to be something having to do with our electrical grid
[2:53:17.880 --> 2:53:21.560]  because once the grid goes down, we have no communication. I totally agree with you.
[2:53:21.560 --> 2:53:23.800]  They want to bring us to our knees. Thank you so much, Alex.
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:30.760]  Gut level Patriot Barbie, Lindsey Graham, what do you see them pulling? Oh gosh,
[2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:37.000]  it's terrifying to think about. I think that the food supply chain is probably their very first
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:41.880]  move. Listen, I don't know what I'm talking about, but when I'm a normal mom sitting around trying
[2:53:41.880 --> 2:53:47.960]  to do what all I can do, this is what I'm seeing is the fake meat, the cows dying. These are not
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:52.120]  conspiracy theories. This is just too weird. Anyone that's awake knows that this is not normal.
[2:53:52.120 --> 2:53:56.040]  All the food factories burning down. I mean, that's not something they're going to do. That's
[2:53:56.040 --> 2:54:01.480]  currently happening. To me, that is the first thing. They're shutting the infrastructure off,
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:08.760]  the energy off, everything. Jay in Pennsylvania, combat veteran. Go ahead. Hey Jay, I just
[2:54:08.760 --> 2:54:13.400]  just bought this game back in Pennsylvania with most of the youth that you were selling your caveman
[2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:19.000]  haven't messed up. So me and my fiance since back four stops, still you and Owen, we have both
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:25.080]  a founder, Corey and street school bars. Basically, Mary's going to call in is for everybody listening
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:31.000]  who hasn't bought a product is on effect. I used to be a drug addict with snorting pills.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:35.480]  I couldn't get 12 hours without withdrawing. I used to think you were peddling snake oil or
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:41.720]  just trying to make money until I bought your product. I feel the busy magnesium,
[2:54:41.720 --> 2:54:47.560]  the vitamin mineral fusion, your winter sun, S2I9, B12, and palladium. I literally
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:54:52.360]  subsidized my withdrawals. I'm trying not to cry, Alex, but I don't want to thank you because you
[2:54:52.360 --> 2:54:57.720]  went through products literally saved my life. I was a drug addict and I'm now clean and a
[2:54:57.720 --> 2:55:02.360]  paramedic and I just can't thank you enough. That's why I want to call because your products do
[2:55:02.360 --> 2:55:06.280]  work. Oh, they're all the highest grade out there. It doesn't mean I'm perfectly in health or
[2:55:06.280 --> 2:55:10.200]  perfect myself, but they're great products and they keep us on air, which makes them amazing
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:15.800]  and everybody should get them. Absolutely. What's your view on this whole craziness?
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:22.680]  It's absolutely mind-blowing what's going on. We've definitely seen supply chains in my area
[2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:29.240]  and going down the false flags, what they're doing with the military. I mean, I've got out in 2011,
[2:55:29.240 --> 2:55:34.440]  so I saw it going downhill and I got out a long time ago and just like the weather,
[2:55:34.440 --> 2:55:38.360]  I'm in central Pennsylvania. It's a creature drying up. It's like they're messing with the
[2:55:38.360 --> 2:55:46.360]  weather like they're trying to kill the crops. They're doing border crisis. I'm seeing migrants
[2:55:46.360 --> 2:55:50.760]  in my area, your rural Pennsylvania, they're breaking it down and it's happening right
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:54.120]  over there. They're bringing the country down. All right. Well, we're aware of it. We're going
[2:55:54.120 --> 2:55:58.200]  to fight back against it. It's the only option we have. Patriot Barbie, I want to thank you
[2:55:58.200 --> 2:56:03.960]  for coming in studio with us. You'll be on the war room coming up in two hours at 4 p.m. Central
[2:56:03.960 --> 2:56:08.840]  with Owen Schreuer, but closing comments to the audience. Thank you guys so much for supporting
[2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:14.520]  my fight. Thank you for supporting Info Wars. Let's get Hunter Biden some of those supplements,
[2:56:14.520 --> 2:56:18.840]  shall we? Get him on the right track. That would help him. Thank you guys. Thanks for having me
[2:56:18.840 --> 2:56:24.840]  and guys. Keep the faith. Stay strong. Fight back. Always, always do what's right, no matter what
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:30.120]  it costs. That's what we all need to be doing. Absolutely. And speaking of that, we have the
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:34.920]  Democratic Party that bankrupted the NRA and Remington trying to shut us down. We've held out
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:38.760]  longer than they have. We can hold out forever. Got a bunch of plans that are behind schedule,
[2:56:38.760 --> 2:56:42.520]  but are very close to launching. We need funds now. Your whole investment of time in there is
[2:56:42.520 --> 2:56:46.920]  over the years. It's now up to right now. We're on air at the most critical time in our history.
[2:56:46.920 --> 2:56:52.280]  We need to stay on air. So get great products you need at the same time and keep Info Wars on
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:57.640]  the air. Get an Alex Jones's right t-shirt. Get an Info Wars t-shirt that really funds our operation

[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:31.400]  the baton to our guest hosts. I'm going to try to jam in a few more phone calls from Mark,

[2:58:47.240 --> 2:58:53.160]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the highest
[2:58:53.160 --> 2:58:58.680]  quality signature-reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon, and other U.S. government agencies.

[3:00:00.520 --> 3:00:04.840]  The end game of the globalist is implantable microchips in our bodies, Klaus Schwab told us.
[3:00:05.560 --> 3:00:11.800]  Stories on InfoWars.com. China is the beta test. CCP issuing location, temperature monitoring
[3:00:11.800 --> 3:00:20.200]  bracelets, the Beijing residents returning from other cities. It's on right now. Let's talk to
[3:00:20.200 --> 3:00:27.000]  Donna in Texas, then Mark and John. Donna, thanks for calling today. Go ahead. Hi, Alex. I love the
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  show today. Listen, I'm calling. You just said about the end game. You know, I want to encourage
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:40.280]  everybody that obviously all the struggle that's going on, it's mainly bringing everybody together
[3:00:40.280 --> 3:00:46.920]  in Christ. The union in Christ is going to make us stronger. But not just theoretically,
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:56.200]  it's we get stronger when we're giving. So if I'm giving financially to you to support you
[3:00:56.200 --> 3:01:02.680]  or other places consistently, I wanted to share this because I myself have dedicated my life to
[3:01:02.680 --> 3:01:08.680]  ministering and specifically understanding the quantum physics of human consciousness
[3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:16.600]  and specifically in terms of giving and receiving. And when we're giving constantly,
[3:01:16.600 --> 3:01:23.560]  like if I make a commitment every month to give, it's not just over being nice. We need to support
[3:01:23.560 --> 3:01:29.480]  obviously those that are sharing truth and speaking up. But for our community in Christ,
[3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:37.800]  when we're giving consistently, we literally heal our brain and our mind when we give the left and
[3:01:37.800 --> 3:01:45.320]  the right brain hemisphere merge together in unity and light. So we heal anxiety, insomnia,
[3:01:45.320 --> 3:01:51.000]  depression, anything in our body through giving. So I just want to encourage everybody that
[3:01:51.720 --> 3:01:58.280]  everything that's going on right now, just give, give support, Alex, give to, you know,
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:03.400]  people that are in Christ, you know, by the way, Donna, you're not just saying that the studies
[3:02:03.400 --> 3:02:08.600]  do show that, but plus it's a natural defense mechanism against tyranny to stand up and support
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:13.720]  organizations that are fighting for you. But just like humans, exhale, carbon dioxide, plants,
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:19.000]  breathe carbon dioxide, they put off oxygen. It's a symbiotic relationship giving us key.
[3:02:20.040 --> 3:02:26.920]  Yes, but I believe all this challenge ultimately is going to end in Christ winning. So we have
[3:02:26.920 --> 3:02:34.840]  to have this for Christians and people in Christ to come together to be so strong in Christ through
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:39.240]  our relationship with Christ, but specifically in giving to our communities. And that's right.
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:44.360]  And the evil is going to force things so bad and cut us all off with a social credit score
[3:02:44.360 --> 3:02:47.800]  that it's going to force us to finally understand that and come together. You're right.
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:54.200]  Yeah, but here's what I have believed for so long. The quicker we get the lesson right now,
[3:02:54.200 --> 3:03:00.040]  the quicker we start giving more, give more money, support the church, support us, support the people
[3:03:00.040 --> 3:03:06.040]  in your neighborhood. Because listen, I'm coming just like Patriot Barbie. I'm telling you, I've
[3:03:06.040 --> 3:03:11.320]  been in ministry for many, many years as a senior Christian recording artist, as well as a public
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:17.560]  speaker. But I have struggled, Alex, the last two years, I've lost everything, everything. I'm a
[3:03:17.560 --> 3:03:25.640]  literally starving artist, but I have faith. And I've been where I've ministered in shelters
[3:03:25.640 --> 3:03:30.520]  and women's shelters. I've done fundraisers, but when I needed it, I wanted to share this too,
[3:03:31.160 --> 3:03:36.520]  that I've gone through, I've looked into the government help, the, you know, homeless places
[3:03:36.520 --> 3:03:45.240]  to get housing. Alex, there is no help for people like me. There's help for other identity groups,
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:51.480]  okay, and racial groups. But if you're a single female like myself, that doesn't do drugs, I'm
[3:03:51.480 --> 3:03:58.680]  not a certain identity group, I'm not an ex-con, you just leave on the street. And so I'm, I share
[3:03:58.680 --> 3:04:04.760]  that to say people, please be there for the people in your community, because that's what it's going
[3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:11.720]  to take right now. Support giving, make a commitment to give financially. And beautifully said, Donna,
[3:04:11.720 --> 3:04:16.040]  God bless you. And I appreciate your call so much. What an honor to have you on the broadcast with
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:21.000]  us today. All right, Paul Joseph Watson always does a great hour. And I don't want to cut him
[3:04:21.000 --> 3:04:26.440]  short. So John and Mark, don't forget, crew's great. Don't forget tomorrow. We're going to open
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:29.960]  the phones up. We're going to continue the discussion of the Democrats preparing martial law,
[3:04:30.520 --> 3:04:35.160]  all of it. I'm sure Owen will be covering an hour with the war room. But John and Mark,
[3:04:35.160 --> 3:04:38.840]  you'll be first tomorrow. We'll call you back if you give us your number and get you on the show.
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:44.760]  Paul Joseph Watson from England takes over summit.newstraightaheadinfowars.com.

[3:05:24.840 --> 3:05:29.560]  and it's happened just like clockwork. And I'm telling you, it's going to get a lot worse.

[3:06:24.920 --> 3:06:31.800]  It is the 15th of July, 2022. It is the height, the middle of summer. And yet, as we're going to
[3:06:31.800 --> 3:06:38.600]  cover in this broadcast, some people whose entire identity is predicated upon, revolves around being
[3:06:38.600 --> 3:06:44.680]  constantly terrified of whatever the current thing may be, have a new current thing to be
[3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:50.040]  terrified by. Because yes, indeed, it is summer. And despite the fact that much of the summer here
[3:06:50.040 --> 3:06:57.800]  in the UK has been relatively mild, suddenly, in the middle of July, we have hot temperatures. And
[3:06:57.800 --> 3:07:06.200]  you know what that means? Global warming, fear mongering. BBC News reports, heatwave national
[3:07:06.200 --> 3:07:12.600]  emergency declared after UK's first red extreme heat warning. You know, we've had these kind of
[3:07:12.600 --> 3:07:17.720]  temperatures in the past. They didn't call national emergencies. They didn't have emergency
[3:07:17.720 --> 3:07:25.400]  government cobra meetings. They didn't issue red extreme heat warnings. We had one in 1976,
[3:07:25.400 --> 3:07:29.880]  the summer of 76. Everyone just went out. They went to the swimming pool. They went to the beach.
[3:07:29.880 --> 3:07:36.680]  They had fun. They enjoyed themselves. No. Now, because of this weasley safetyism that's gripped
[3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:42.760]  our country over the past couple of decades, people are once again scurrying back inside.
[3:07:42.760 --> 3:07:46.840]  They're retreating to the safety of their own homes, despite the fact that in many cases,
[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:50.760]  because we don't have air conditioning in this country, the inside of their homes are even
[3:07:50.760 --> 3:07:56.200]  hotter than mean outside. That doesn't matter. And basically the media, the clickbait mainstream
[3:07:56.200 --> 3:08:01.000]  media is absolutely loving it because everyone likes to talk about the weather in this country
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:09.400]  anyway. And now we get some hot weather in summer. My God, the absolute horror. Sky News reports UK
[3:08:09.400 --> 3:08:13.720]  heatwave cobra meeting called as national heat wave emergency could be declared.
[3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:19.480]  Yes, they're literally calling an emergency congregation of top government officials
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:24.360]  because it's getting a little bit hot in the middle of July. Absolutely incredible.
[3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:30.920]  Bear in mind, these are all the same people that locked us down based on the founding myth that
[3:08:30.920 --> 3:08:37.160]  COVID was this massive killer. The same people are doing so. Again, you've got this strange dichotomy
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:43.320]  where people are equally terrified of a slight rise in COVID cases in the United Kingdom over
[3:08:43.320 --> 3:08:48.920]  the past few weeks, while also being absolutely petrified of it getting a bit hot in summer.
[3:08:49.480 --> 3:08:55.400]  So they're outside in summer in 35 degrees Celsius temperatures, but also with their masks on,
[3:08:56.280 --> 3:09:00.280]  actually restricting their own breathing at a time when you wouldn't want that to happen,
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:04.680]  because they're scared equally of both things because the media and the government have told
[3:09:04.680 --> 3:09:12.520]  them to be scared of it. Headline up on summit.news latest excuse for technocratic control. It's hot in
[3:09:12.520 --> 3:09:19.160]  summer. Now, bear in mind, this is coming out of the UK Met Office, which poses as an independent
[3:09:20.600 --> 3:09:27.720]  meteorological agency. Easy for me to say. And yet they've engaged in climate change hysteria
[3:09:27.720 --> 3:09:34.920]  on the regular routinely over the course of the past two decades. And in fact, there's an article
[3:09:34.920 --> 3:09:40.680]  speaking to that before I get into the latest hysteria, which is out of Daily Skeptic,
[3:09:40.680 --> 3:09:45.320]  which is linked in that article, net zero global warming alarm based on temperatures
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:51.960]  measured next to airport runways with hot jet engines and tarmac. We've seen these reports
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:57.800]  before where the foundational global temperature rises that are parodied in the media that parodied
[3:09:57.800 --> 3:10:03.080]  by the media as being indicative of manmade climate change and rising temperatures. They
[3:10:03.080 --> 3:10:08.920]  take the temperature measurements of the hottest surface in the hottest location you could imagine.
[3:10:08.920 --> 3:10:15.240]  It's not a fair measurement. It's deliberate manipulation. So there's about one half of all
[3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:19.320]  land surface temperature measurements used to show global warming and promote the command and
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:25.640]  control net zero agenda. It's basically across Europe has got the farmers in revolt. We've seen
[3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:30.520]  it in Holland. We've seen it in France. Now we're seeing it in Spain as well because they're bearing
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:36.280]  the brunt of the nitrogen restriction rules that they're imposing in those countries.
[3:10:36.280 --> 3:10:41.080]  They measure the temperature rises in the hottest places you could possibly do that.
[3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:48.280]  They're taken near or adjacent to airport runways. This is one half of all land surface temperature
[3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:54.360]  measurements. There's this amazing fact from research by Professor Ross McKittrick cast
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:10:58.360]  further serious doubt on the validity of three major global temperature data sets,
[3:10:58.360 --> 3:11:06.280]  including the one compiled by the Met Office, which is in the news today saying it's a national
[3:11:06.280 --> 3:11:13.720]  emergency that it's getting hot in summer. Oh my God, panic. Red extreme heat warning
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:19.560]  issued says the Met Office's official Twitter account, parts of England on Monday and Tuesday.
[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:26.520]  And as commentators have noticed over the past couple of days, they posted the previous weather
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:34.440]  forecast maps for the United Kingdom when we had similar temperatures in the mid 30s to early 40s
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:42.600]  or mid 30s to late 30s. Previously, they didn't color the country in blood red. Now they've changed
[3:11:42.600 --> 3:11:48.520]  it to color the country in blood red with these temperature forecasts again to advance this
[3:11:48.520 --> 3:11:55.560]  hysterical contrived moral panic that it's never hot at the height of summer. Granted most weather
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:01.320]  and most weather in the UK is terrible. It rains out of one of every three days. But again, as I
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:07.480]  said, it's been a cold winter two weeks, two weekends ago, it was absolutely freezing. It was
[3:12:07.480 --> 3:12:15.320]  like 16 degrees at the start of July. They don't talk about that. The same people who say weather
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:21.400]  is an indicative of climate change when it's cold say, Oh, no, but it is indicative of climate
[3:12:21.400 --> 3:12:27.480]  change when it's hot because we say so. That's basically the argument. So they put out these
[3:12:28.760 --> 3:12:34.600]  apocalyptic temperature graphs in the mid 30s with blood red covering the entire country
[3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:39.080]  and say people are going to die in their thousands. It's going to be horrific. Again, it's this entire
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:46.200]  mindset of safetyism. They've built this mindset within the United Kingdom, which the stereotype
[3:12:46.200 --> 3:12:50.520]  was true. It used to be stiff or polyp. The United Kingdom used to be comprised of people
[3:12:50.520 --> 3:12:57.720]  who were hard as nails. Now everyone's living in constant terror, constant panic, constant fear
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:02.920]  of whatever current narrative they've been fed by the media and by the government.
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:09.800]  But as we've noted, and as I know in this article, in the real world, and this was just a few months
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:17.720]  ago, Arctic sea ice is just 3% below its 30 year average. But again, what's the real agenda as we
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:24.280]  reported last year, one of the authors of the United Nations IPCC report notoriously unreliable
[3:13:24.280 --> 3:13:31.320]  debunked bias, which focused on extreme consequences of manmade global warming. He lauded the fact
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:37.160]  that people are quote starting to get scared about climate change and that this would affect
[3:13:37.160 --> 3:13:43.000]  the way they vote. So they're literally explicitly and these were the same people behind the Club
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:50.280]  of Rome report in the early 1990s, saying the only thing that's going to unify people behind
[3:13:50.280 --> 3:13:56.280]  our agenda is making man an enemy of the planet, making man itself the enemy, because they've
[3:13:56.280 --> 3:14:01.240]  tried all these other things, none of them worked. They tried to run with the Oh, there's going to be
[3:14:01.240 --> 3:14:08.360]  a new Ice Age scam in the 1970s. Newsweek printed that bunch of other legacy media publications
[3:14:08.360 --> 3:14:14.680]  ran with that complete bunk never happened. We also had the 2004 report in The Guardian, which
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:20.440]  again, I linked to in this article, they said that manmade climate change would cause quote
[3:14:20.440 --> 3:14:26.840]  millions of deaths, major European cities would be sunken, and there'd be nuclear war. And they
[3:14:26.840 --> 3:14:32.840]  actually put a date on it. And that date was 2020. That day has kind of passed, didn't happen.
[3:14:32.840 --> 3:14:40.040]  Again, I remember being a kid in the early 90s. I literally remember the moment of feeling terrified
[3:14:40.040 --> 3:14:46.040]  myself as a kid, hearing a radio report saying that the climate of the United Kingdom would be
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:52.920]  like Siberia within 30 years. They were spinning this yarn 30 years ago, they've been proven wrong
[3:14:52.920 --> 3:15:00.840]  time and time again. Montana's Glacier National Park, they put up signs which said glaciers will
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:08.360]  all be gone by 2020. Didn't happen, they had to remove the signs. Again, we've had the predictions
[3:15:08.360 --> 3:15:15.160]  of massive global population boom over population that would lead to giant famines. The same people
[3:15:15.160 --> 3:15:22.600]  who put out that propaganda back in the 60s and 70s, Paul Ehrlich and his ilk. And now the same
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:27.880]  people behind the global warming scam. Why would we trust these people when they've lied to us
[3:15:27.880 --> 3:15:34.840]  over and over again? Al Gore, Arctic would have ice-free summers by 2013. Again, as we've seen,
[3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:41.880]  the extent of Arctic sea ice is barely any different from what it was 10 years ago. It's a scam
[3:15:41.880 --> 3:15:46.840]  that pulling it over and over again, why anyone affords them any credibility at this point,
[3:15:46.840 --> 3:15:50.840]  is absolutely mind-boggling. Summit.News. Well, goodbye.
[3:15:50.840 --> 3:16:00.520]  Goodbye. The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:06.280]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press. Free speech means
[3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:12.920]  the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference and restraint
[3:16:12.920 --> 3:16:20.040]  by the government. 231 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious
[3:16:20.040 --> 3:16:26.440]  attack. GCN is under attack. Your freedom is currently under siege from those who do not

[3:19:56.360 --> 3:20:14.280]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:19.240]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:20:22.200 --> 3:20:27.480]  Well, we know why they're pushing the extreme heat, the moral panic, the hysteria over
[3:20:28.120 --> 3:20:33.800]  God forbid warm weather in summer in the United Kingdom, a country that moans incessantly about
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:40.040]  the cold and the rain for 10 months out of the year. As soon as it gets a bit warm,
[3:20:40.040 --> 3:20:45.400]  as soon as it gets a bit Mediterranean, oh my God, the horror. We're destroying the planet.
[3:20:45.400 --> 3:20:51.320]  Absolute bunk from the same people who take these global temperature measurements from
[3:20:51.320 --> 3:20:59.720]  airport runways on hot tarmac fired by jet engines. Absolutely incredible. And you know the agenda
[3:20:59.720 --> 3:21:04.360]  because they'll introduce any current thing necessary to try and convince you to go along
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:08.360]  with it to reduce your living standards. We have that again with the war in Ukraine.
[3:21:08.360 --> 3:21:15.960]  Macron announces street lights will be turned off in France in response to energy crisis despite
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:21.480]  claiming that France has little dependence on Russian gas. President Macron, who has just
[3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:25.640]  formed a minority government that is pathetic and can't get anything through parliament,
[3:21:26.760 --> 3:21:31.880]  announced that public lighting will be turned off at night to save energy. And again,
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:36.840]  this was a program, this was an agenda, food inflation, the cost of living crisis that was
[3:21:36.840 --> 3:21:43.080]  in evidence before the invasion of Ukraine. They just use that as an excuse to get you to go along
[3:21:43.080 --> 3:21:48.280]  with it to support the current thing. Even as in other European countries like Germany,
[3:21:48.280 --> 3:21:54.920]  they're literally designating areas of cities as warm up areas for people who are freezing
[3:21:54.920 --> 3:22:00.600]  this coming winter because they won't be able to afford their energy bills. And again,
[3:22:00.600 --> 3:22:06.360]  whether it's through climate change propaganda, whether it's through war current thing propaganda,
[3:22:06.360 --> 3:22:12.360]  the end goal always remains the same. Of course, we have the same narrative being pushed
[3:22:13.000 --> 3:22:20.520]  during the coronavirus lockdown, the one in 2021, also in the context of climate change where the
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:26.760]  Indian government locked down cities based on pollution. And then the mainstream media came
[3:22:26.760 --> 3:22:32.120]  out and ran articles saying it was a conspiracy theory to even suggest that there were climate
[3:22:32.120 --> 3:22:38.520]  lockdowns taking place, even as the Indian government, the biggest democracy in the world,
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:45.000]  was literally implementing them in major cities in India. Absolutely incredible.
[3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:49.640]  Let's talk about the other current thing, which still remains current, despite the fact that
[3:22:49.640 --> 3:22:56.840]  many people thought it would disappear in 2022. That is COVID, we see the same technocrats creeping
[3:22:56.840 --> 3:23:03.720]  back once again, here in the United Kingdom, BBC News reports COVID booster will be offered to all
[3:23:03.720 --> 3:23:10.840]  over 50s this autumn. Meanwhile, daily skeptic reports, corona phobic Britain starts locking
[3:23:10.840 --> 3:23:18.360]  itself down. Again, there's been a tiny spike in cases of this new variant, oh my God, that causes
[3:23:18.360 --> 3:23:25.560]  sniffles. No knock on effect in terms of serious illness, people going on ventilators or people
[3:23:25.560 --> 3:23:31.560]  dying in hospitals, none of that is happening, because this new variant, the latest variant,
[3:23:31.560 --> 3:23:38.280]  which I had, I've literally had worst colds, doesn't cause serious illness. Maybe it does for
[3:23:38.280 --> 3:23:43.480]  people who took their four or five vaccines. But the UK is currently in the midst of a mild
[3:23:43.480 --> 3:23:48.440]  fifth wave that has seen infections rise for the past month. And again, if you look at the actual
[3:23:48.440 --> 3:23:55.320]  infection rates, it's like a tiny blip. But you go out in the streets and there's like 50%
[3:23:55.320 --> 3:24:01.320]  more people wearing masks again, they have no critical thinking skills, they're so easily led,
[3:24:01.320 --> 3:24:06.760]  and their entire existence is based around being terrified by something. It's like they need to be
[3:24:06.760 --> 3:24:12.200]  terrified by something to instill their lives with some kind of meaning, despite the fact they're
[3:24:12.200 --> 3:24:16.680]  not even living their lives because they're living in constant fear of everything, whether that be
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:21.720]  COVID in its mildest ever form, or oh my God, the sunshine.
[3:24:21.720 --> 3:24:29.000]  So with 2.7 million people carrying COVID in the most recent week, even though deaths and ICU
[3:24:29.000 --> 3:24:36.920]  admissions have remained flat, but a poll for mail online found 29% of people have stayed indoors
[3:24:37.480 --> 3:24:45.240]  at some point since cases began rising to avoid catching the sniffles, while 42% of worn a face
[3:24:45.240 --> 3:24:50.760]  covering. So almost half of worn a face covering, despite the fact there hasn't been any mandates
[3:24:50.760 --> 3:24:56.680]  on face masks in the United Kingdom for half a year now, there's almost half observed social
[3:24:56.680 --> 3:25:01.480]  distancing rules that have not been in place since February, while two thirds said they had
[3:25:01.480 --> 3:25:08.200]  sanitized their hands. So again, as soon as it creeps back into the headlines, as soon as the
[3:25:08.200 --> 3:25:14.680]  globalists, the technocrats stop ramping it up, hyping it up in an alarmist fashion again,
[3:25:14.680 --> 3:25:20.360]  you see the knock on effect in the streets in people's behavior. And yet these people who
[3:25:20.360 --> 3:25:26.760]  are so obsessed with staying safe and safetyism in general, and not putting themselves at any
[3:25:26.760 --> 3:25:32.600]  risk whatsoever, living in a bubble their entire lives, they're deathly afraid of a virus which
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:39.720]  is now mutated into such a mild form that people have way worse colds. But what they're not concerned
[3:25:39.720 --> 3:25:48.600]  about is the fact that in the United Kingdom, there have been 9,000 non COVID excess deaths
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:55.320]  in the last 10 weeks alone. Now, what's causing these excess deaths that weren't registered
[3:25:55.320 --> 3:26:01.000]  in previous records if you go back three years, five years, 10 years? Well, we know some of them
[3:26:01.560 --> 3:26:07.320]  are because during the pandemic, during the lockdown, hospitals were only 40% full.
[3:26:08.360 --> 3:26:13.000]  Despite the fact that we were told they were overwhelmed, because they kicked all the patients
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:18.840]  out, and they prevented people from being treated for serious illnesses in hospital, something that
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:23.560]  has already killed tens of thousands of people will probably end up killing hundreds of thousands
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:28.840]  of people. So now all those people who didn't get that urgent medical care that they required
[3:26:28.840 --> 3:26:32.600]  during the lockdowns because they were either afraid to go into hospitals because of the
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:37.400]  propaganda, or the hospitals didn't want them to come, or they couldn't get doctor's appointments
[3:26:37.400 --> 3:26:42.440]  because all the doctors said you have to do a remote appointment, you have to do it via Zoom,
[3:26:42.440 --> 3:26:47.320]  so people said what's the point in that? I'm not going to bother. Well, all those people are now
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:52.520]  dying. And all those people who supported lockdown, the blood is on their hands.
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:58.200]  But no one's talking about this. They're talking about a slight rise in COVID infections. They're
[3:26:58.200 --> 3:27:06.120]  talking about a fifth vaccine, the 100% ineffective vaccine, giving out to 50 year olds here in the
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:11.800]  coming months. They're talking about heatwaves killing people. They're not talking about something
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:19.480]  that has killed 9,000 people, non-COVID excess deaths, none of the usual reasons, heart attacks,
[3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:26.920]  cancer, whatever. This is excess deaths that are not normally registered, 9,000 in the last 10 weeks.
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:32.280]  If there were 9,000 COVID deaths in the last 10 weeks that have us under lockdown again.
[3:27:33.240 --> 3:27:40.440]  But this article in The Daily Skeptic also notes, looking at deaths by date of occurrence,
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:46.200]  if we compare them to the rollout of the vaccine doses in the spring booster campaign
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:51.800]  among over 75s in England, we can see what appears to be a correlation,
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:57.320]  meaning a possible connection should be investigated. Then you look at this graph in the article,
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:03.640]  the spring boosters for the over 75s in England started at the end of March,
[3:28:03.640 --> 3:28:08.200]  they continued and peaked throughout April towards the end of April, then they continued
[3:28:08.200 --> 3:28:14.920]  throughout May until the end of June. And you'll notice that the correlation between the vaccine
[3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:23.560]  boosters and the non-COVID excess deaths almost aligns completely. Now obviously some of these
[3:28:23.560 --> 3:28:28.440]  deaths are caused by people not being able to get treatment because of lockdown, but then others
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:33.800]  are caused by a different reason that we're not allowed to talk about in this country,
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:39.480]  that we're not allowed to talk about on social media because we'll be blacklisted and silenced.
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:45.480]  But if you want to look at that graph, very interesting correlation between the spring boosters
[3:28:45.480 --> 3:28:51.080]  in England and non-COVID excess deaths which remain in this country according to the media,
[3:28:51.080 --> 3:29:20.920]  the mystery will be back.
[3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:45.160]  By the way, it works for me in case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working
[3:29:45.160 --> 3:29:52.680]  for me quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men,

[3:30:54.520 --> 3:30:58.600]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer,
[3:30:58.600 --> 3:31:03.640]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[3:31:03.640 --> 3:31:08.360]  profiles, you see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different
[3:31:08.360 --> 3:31:13.960]  tax returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big
[3:31:13.960 --> 3:31:18.360]  firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[3:31:18.360 --> 3:31:23.880]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation with inflation
[3:31:23.880 --> 3:31:29.800]  and all the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and
[3:31:29.800 --> 3:31:34.040]  lawful that allows you to keep more your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great
[3:31:34.040 --> 3:31:40.680]  tax advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,

[3:32:41.160 --> 3:32:48.600]  info workstation support is changing the world and this is the final 75 three-point set exclusively
[3:32:48.600 --> 3:33:12.600]  available at 1776point.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:34.440]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:42.120]  Joseph Watson. Now I want to get to some of these videos here in a moment, we've got quite a few
[3:33:42.120 --> 3:33:47.240]  to plow through and indeed there are updates to those videos that I put out that I want to
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:52.680]  come back and talk about off the back of them. Final word on this vaccine COVID issue though,
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:33:57.960]  because I mentioned Macron earlier, he was actually booed and given the finger by French
[3:33:57.960 --> 3:34:03.960]  citizens in Paris during their Bastille Day parade yesterday. Someone put out a video on
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:10.120]  Twitter of multiple clips of Macron being booed, jeered, whistled, given the finger,
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:15.320]  that didn't make the media at least at the time that I put this article out. Problem with Macron
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:20.520]  is that he now rules over a minority government because he had basically a disastrous election
[3:34:20.520 --> 3:34:27.000]  last month. So he can't get any legislation through and they tried to get the vaccine
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:32.280]  passport scheme through at least as it applies to foreigners coming into the country. Despite the
[3:34:32.280 --> 3:34:37.000]  fact that virtually every other European country now has dropped that mandate that you have to get
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:42.360]  vaccinated to enter the country. United States doesn't drop to obviously so I've got no hope
[3:34:42.360 --> 3:34:47.960]  of entering the United States probably until Biden gets kicked out of office if not beyond that.
[3:34:48.920 --> 3:34:55.080]  But in France they tried to pass a vaccine passport scheme. Macron's government lost the vote by a
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:35:03.480]  margin of 219 votes to 195. We saw wild cheering celebrations in the French parliament because
[3:35:03.480 --> 3:35:09.000]  of that. Remember the vaccine passport was of course initially enforced against French people
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:14.120]  themselves. You weren't even allowed to go to a cafe, to a bar, to a restaurant without a vaccine
[3:35:14.120 --> 3:35:21.000]  passport and they literally had police patrolling checking people's vaccine papers even if they
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:27.880]  were sitting outside at a Parisian cafe. Good news though because Macron now had a disastrous
[3:35:27.880 --> 3:35:33.720]  election. He's got a minority government. He can't get it through. That gridlock is a good thing
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:39.400]  for freedom. But let's go to this first video now because there is an update on it. This is
[3:35:39.400 --> 3:35:46.280]  regarding the bizarre behavior of Joe Biden. He's obviously slipped into dementia, into cognitive
[3:35:46.280 --> 3:35:52.840]  decline which has become very apparent over the past two years since a doctor, as I feature in
[3:35:52.840 --> 3:35:58.920]  this video, made an estimation on whether he was suffering from dementia or not. This video is called
[3:35:58.920 --> 3:36:10.760]  There's Something Wrong with Biden. Here it is. There's Something Wrong with Joe. The evidence is
[3:36:10.760 --> 3:36:15.800]  just overwhelming and I'm sorry I'm not making fun of dementia or anything like that. But for the
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:38.440]  political leader of the free world, it's just getting really awkward. When the political coverage of the
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:56.120]  finale, excuse me, finale and what am I doing here? A question that has baffled some of the
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:12.040]  greatest minds on planet Earth. Well folks, you know, you don't have to stand every time I hear
[3:37:12.040 --> 3:37:17.640]  Hail of the Chief wonder where the hell is he? It took me a long while. Do you think I'm joking?
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:23.160]  Turn around and where's the president? Some of this is actually quite sad. It's almost like
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:33.320]  it's a cry for help. She's fine. It's me. That's not together. This doctor talked about signs of
[3:37:33.320 --> 3:37:39.640]  dementia back in 2020. This is Dr. Grande. Does he have some type of dementia or is he exhibiting
[3:37:39.640 --> 3:37:44.280]  early warning signs of dementia? And although the doc was quite skeptical at the time,
[3:37:44.280 --> 3:37:50.600]  look at what he said and compare it to how Biden has behaved since. Memory problems really stand out,
[3:37:50.600 --> 3:37:58.520]  especially short-term recall. And we're also joined today by, uh, uh, Larson and, uh, and, uh,
[3:37:58.520 --> 3:38:08.760]  uh, how do you answer whether to go to Saudi Arabia? No, not yet. No, no. It happens to be a
[3:38:08.760 --> 3:38:13.800]  large immediate taking place in Saudi Arabia. That's the reason I'm going. It's that short-term
[3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:19.160]  recall that is much more noticeable in terms of looking at symptoms that point to dementia.
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:36.200]  Next, we see difficulty concentrating, losing track of the topic.
[3:38:36.200 --> 3:38:44.440]  You, uh, like to be able to, anyway, America is a nation that can be defined in a single word.
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:51.000]  I was in the foothills of the Himalayas with Xi Jinping.
[3:38:56.440 --> 3:39:01.160]  Getting lost when outside the house. Sometimes people also get lost in their own house.
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:18.200]  This is considered a more severe symptom.
[3:39:42.520 --> 3:39:56.200]  I get up in the morning and look at you and say, where the hell are we getting lost?
[3:39:56.200 --> 3:40:03.960]  That's the president of the United States in his own house. Sometimes people also get lost in their
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:19.640]  own house. Other symptoms include going off on tangents, being repetitious, having difficulty
[3:40:19.640 --> 3:40:33.240]  finding the right word. He forgot Barack Obama's name.
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:40.120]  We have a conversion of the road to Damascus because now you say, by the way, are you going
[3:40:40.120 --> 3:40:50.280]  to stick with the president on the following president, the last guy on this issue?
[3:40:50.280 --> 3:41:03.720]  This is when somebody has gaps in their memory and their brain populates memories into those gaps.
[3:41:03.720 --> 3:41:23.160]  The president didn't make a commencement speech.
[3:41:23.160 --> 3:41:29.080]  Getting a lot of reaction after saying he used to drive an 18-wheeler during a visit
[3:41:29.080 --> 3:41:34.360]  to a Mack truck assembly plant yesterday while the White House is struggling to defend the claim
[3:41:34.360 --> 3:41:38.680]  since driving a big rig requires a special license for one and while there is nothing in
[3:41:38.680 --> 3:41:44.120]  Biden's history to suggest he's ever actually done this. We also see difficulties with agitation,
[3:41:44.120 --> 3:42:08.680]  anxiety, paranoia. I don't know if Biden has dementia or not. The doctor said that in 2020,
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:13.880]  but as you've seen, the last two years of Biden's antics somewhat fit the bill.
[3:42:16.680 --> 3:42:21.800]  Now, there's been an update to this today. Former White House physician says Biden won't finish
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:27.080]  his first term. This is Ronnie Jackson, physician to Obama, physician to Trump.
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:32.120]  Obama wrote him a scathing letter basically saying, how dare you question Biden's cognitive
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:38.760]  ability? Well, now he's questioning it even more given what we just saw in Israel where once again,
[3:42:38.760 --> 3:42:42.600]  that happened after I edited that video together. Yet another example of it,
[3:42:42.600 --> 3:42:48.680]  where he's doing a fresh air handshake with nobody in particular. This is Summit.
[3:42:48.680 --> 3:43:03.240]  Don't use. We'll be back on the other side on the way.
[3:43:33.880 --> 3:43:36.920]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today
[3:43:37.560 --> 3:43:43.560]  and ordering bodies, ultimate tumor formula and info or sort of calm. It is simply amazing.

[3:45:53.800 --> 3:46:01.240]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[3:46:01.240 --> 3:46:06.920]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[3:46:06.920 --> 3:46:13.480]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested
[3:46:13.480 --> 3:46:19.800]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:25.480]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:32.280]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and
[3:46:32.280 --> 3:46:38.920]  DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of
[3:46:38.920 --> 3:46:45.640]  immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about
[3:46:45.640 --> 3:46:51.880]  actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend family member or

[3:47:00.760 --> 3:47:16.840]  Alex Jones. You're listening to the summit. news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:47:16.840 --> 3:47:23.480]  We've got a couple of videos to get through and we have updates on these issues. So first we're
[3:47:23.480 --> 3:47:29.560]  going to go to this one. Basically, it happened again. It should have been the top story in the
[3:47:29.560 --> 3:47:34.120]  United Kingdom for the whole of this week for the whole of the rest of the month. It wasn't. It was
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:41.800]  a story for about a day. Once again, gangs of Pakistani Bangladesh Muslim men grooming young
[3:47:41.800 --> 3:47:48.120]  white girls over the course of 30 years, viciously abusing them when it's investigated or indeed not
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:53.560]  investigated by the authorities. They cover it up. They blame the victims because they feared
[3:47:53.560 --> 3:48:00.520]  being called racist. This is yet another example of how political correctness isn't just being nice
[3:48:00.520 --> 3:48:08.360]  to people. It causes relentless real world harm. Political correctness is just being nice to people.
[3:48:08.360 --> 3:48:16.200]  Here's the clip. Can this at least spell the end of that whiny disingenuous craven mantra we've
[3:48:16.200 --> 3:48:22.360]  heard over and over again. Political correctness is just being nice to people. Oh, it isn't. Political
[3:48:22.360 --> 3:48:29.320]  correctness facilitates evil. And yet I'm afraid to say it happened again. Over 1000 young girls
[3:48:29.320 --> 3:48:35.800]  in Telford, children, trafficked and sexually abused over the course of 30 years. The perpetrators
[3:48:35.800 --> 3:48:41.560]  not only got away with it, but the victims were blamed. Why? Because the police and authorities
[3:48:41.560 --> 3:48:47.400]  didn't want to be called racist. Just like Rotherham, just like Rochdale, just like Oxford,
[3:48:47.400 --> 3:48:53.720]  it's an oh-so-familiar tale in diversity's a strength Great Britain. Telford scandal over 1000
[3:48:53.720 --> 3:48:58.680]  girls abused and raped by Asian gangs while police looked the other way. More than 1000 girls were
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:04.040]  sexually abused by gangs of Asian men in Telford while police dropped cases like a hot potato
[3:49:04.040 --> 3:49:09.240]  for fear of inflaming racial tensions. A damning report has found for at least 30 years abusers
[3:49:09.240 --> 3:49:14.280]  in the Shropshire town thrived as their appalling crimes went unchecked by the authorities who were
[3:49:14.280 --> 3:49:21.480]  more concerned about political correctness. They turned a blind eye, ignored obvious signs of sexual
[3:49:21.480 --> 3:49:27.320]  exploitation and get this. Tried to pressure the girls into admitting that they had consented to
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:33.560]  having sex with members of this vile grooming gang. Despite knowing that under the law children
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:39.160]  can't consent to having sex with adults and they accused the girls some as young as 12 of being
[3:49:39.160 --> 3:49:45.720]  prostitutes. Where are all the me too people? Where are all the believe all women activists?
[3:49:45.720 --> 3:49:50.680]  Fucking AWOL, that's where. After brainwashing them they then abused and raped them issuing death
[3:49:50.680 --> 3:49:55.160]  threats if they threatened to expose the abuse. Witnesses told an inquiry how West Mercia police
[3:49:55.160 --> 3:49:58.840]  had appeared frightened to question or challenge because they didn't want to have the finger
[3:49:58.840 --> 3:50:03.880]  pointed at them saying they were being racist. In its findings the report said the forces decisions
[3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:09.480]  were impacted by fear of complaint or because of concern about the impact on racial tensions.
[3:50:09.480 --> 3:50:13.960]  Manchester, same thing. Where authorities refused to stop a network of Pakistani men
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:19.480]  abusing children because they feared it would spark community tensions. Listen if protecting
[3:50:19.480 --> 3:50:25.960]  kids from nonsense sparks community tensions. What kind of communities are we creating in jolly
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:31.720]  old England? The Telford report highlights the fact that these men these abusers were emboldened
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:37.800]  by all this. They knew they'd get away with it for years for decades in some cases forever because
[3:50:37.800 --> 3:50:43.800]  apparently child welfare ranks below our concern about offending minority groups. Tom Crowther QC
[3:50:43.800 --> 3:50:47.720]  who shared the inquiry said quote countless children were sexually assaulted and raped.
[3:50:47.720 --> 3:50:52.840]  They were deliberately humiliated and degraded. They were shared and trafficked. They were subjected
[3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:57.960]  to violence and their families were threatened. Basically every year now a report comes out
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:03.800]  telling the same sordid story. It just keeps happening over and over again so don't keep
[3:51:03.800 --> 3:51:09.240]  telling me that political correctness is just being nice to people. When political correctness
[3:51:09.240 --> 3:51:15.320]  facilitated kids being blown up and maimed at the Manchester arena because despite brazen and
[3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:21.160]  relentless signs of suspicious behavior the suicide bomber was left alone because eyewitnesses,
[3:51:21.160 --> 3:51:27.080]  security guards, police officers feared being called racist. Don't keep telling me we have to
[3:51:27.080 --> 3:51:32.520]  look the other way while over a thousand children are abused simply because police councils and
[3:51:32.520 --> 3:51:37.640]  local authorities didn't want to be called Islamophobic by idiots on Twitter and don't keep
[3:51:37.640 --> 3:51:43.400]  telling me that diversity is a strength as a camouflage to hide the awful truth about what
[3:51:43.400 --> 3:51:52.920]  has happened to this country. So we have not only the industrial abuse of young white girls by this
[3:51:52.920 --> 3:51:59.960]  certain minority community but we also have the systemized cover-up of that crime by the
[3:51:59.960 --> 3:52:05.880]  authorities again out of fears that they would be seen as offending minority groups. Why they would
[3:52:05.880 --> 3:52:12.200]  feel offended by that I don't know. And of course the fact that they may be seen as racist this
[3:52:12.200 --> 3:52:18.120]  kind of ties into it. This came out today at the London Times bearing in mind that this just
[3:52:18.120 --> 3:52:23.080]  happened and it's happened multiple times in the United Kingdom over the past 20 years. Racist
[3:52:23.080 --> 3:52:28.600]  met police course for detectives ditched after protests by attendees. The Metropolitan Police
[3:52:28.600 --> 3:52:32.760]  has been forced to drop a racist misogynistic and discriminatory training program for its next
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:37.640]  generation of detectives after university lecturers refused to deliver it. Lecturers and
[3:52:37.640 --> 3:52:42.520]  students objected to an excessively violent case study that they said stereotyped Asian and Middle
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:50.280]  Eastern immigrants as rapists and child abusers. Because that would never happen in reality would
[3:52:50.280 --> 3:52:56.840]  it? Now it just happens every single month at this point. Let's go to this final video because
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:04.520]  while these Asian grooming gangs are abusing children en masse the important thing in this
[3:53:04.520 --> 3:53:12.600]  country is to continue to make white people feel guilty. This video is called oh no how awful here
[3:53:12.600 --> 3:53:19.560]  it is. Viewers watching the BBC's coverage of the women's European Championships football tournament
[3:53:19.560 --> 3:53:25.320]  noted the very odd reaction of the BBC presenter who was reading out a script to England beating
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:37.960]  Norway the previous night but it wasn't enough just to celebrate England's victory no no no no
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:41.080]  you see the team may have won 8-0 but they did so
[3:53:46.680 --> 3:53:53.240]  they did so while being white but all starting 11 players and the five substitutes that came
[3:53:53.240 --> 3:53:59.640]  on to the pitch were all white oh no the absolute horror were all white and that does point towards
[3:53:59.640 --> 3:54:06.840]  a lack of diversity in the women's game. White people in England a country with an 85% white
[3:54:06.840 --> 3:54:13.160]  population how awful the BBC was noticeably less perturbed about the lack of diversity on
[3:54:13.160 --> 3:54:18.280]  display when the British women's four by 100 meters relay team competed at the Tokyo Olympics
[3:54:18.280 --> 3:54:22.840]  strangely enough I've also never heard them highlight the serious problem which is the lack
[3:54:22.840 --> 3:54:28.520]  of diversity within the Ghanaian national women's team or the Nigerian national women's team or
[3:54:28.520 --> 3:54:33.800]  the Pakistani national women's team what's next is the BBC gonna do a segment on the shocking
[3:54:33.800 --> 3:54:38.840]  lack of diversity within the UK grime scene perhaps they're just too busy telling us that the
[3:54:38.840 --> 3:54:44.520]  English countryside is racist because 98% of the people who live there are white. Thing is there
[3:54:44.520 --> 3:54:49.400]  are three non-white players on the England women's football team presumably they just weren't good
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:54.440]  enough to get in the squad on that night but three players out of a 23 player roster represents
[3:54:54.440 --> 3:55:00.520]  about 13% of them being non-white which mirrors almost exactly the demographic makeup of the
[3:55:00.520 --> 3:55:06.520]  country so in reality by the numbers they are fairly represented. Bear in mind what happened
[3:55:06.520 --> 3:55:12.440]  last summer during the men's tournament where speculation was rife the England manager Gareth
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:17.640]  Southgate deliberately chose black players to take crucial penalties in the Euro final against
[3:55:17.640 --> 3:55:22.840]  Italy in an apparent attempt to enforce some kind of try hard message about diversity and have the
[3:55:22.840 --> 3:55:29.320]  final word on weeks of controversy over players taking the BLM knee before kickoff. Problem being
[3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:35.880]  they both missed the penalties and England lost the game in the whole tournament. Whoops here's
[3:55:35.880 --> 3:55:42.440]  a novel concept maybe just pick the best players regardless of their skin colour and stop crowbarring
[3:55:42.440 --> 3:55:47.880]  divisive identity politics into a sport which already has plenty of non-white representation
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:52.840]  and some kind of desperate extension of your weird agenda to make white people feel guilty
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:56:01.960]  about an immutable characteristic. So let's turn to Germany now in this final two minutes because
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:06.520]  we had a big story out of there the other day. Government figures show non-Germans responsible
[3:56:06.520 --> 3:56:12.360]  for over 39% of murders remember this is off the back of Chancellor Angela Merkel inviting
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:19.400]  in over a million migrants refugees into the country after 2015 she said it was a great success
[3:56:19.400 --> 3:56:25.320]  the government statistics on serious crime tend to suggest otherwise figures released by the
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:30.440]  German government show that non-German foreigners are responsible for over 39% of total murders
[3:56:30.440 --> 3:56:38.680]  and over 56% of manslaughter convictions those figures have risen from 2000 when the number
[3:56:38.680 --> 3:56:46.360]  of non-Germans convicted of murder rose from 29% so that's gone up by 10% in 20 years as they
[3:56:46.360 --> 3:56:55.160]  import more of them and the manslaughter has gone up from 37% to 56% so again a rise of almost 20%
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:57:03.480]  in the space of 20 years now that's interesting because while they represent 39% of total
[3:57:03.480 --> 3:57:10.840]  convictions murder wise they only represent 12% of the population but diversity as we're constantly
[3:57:10.840 --> 3:57:17.400]  reminded is a strength. Germany's new anti-discrimination commissioner called ethnic Germans potatoes
[3:57:18.040 --> 3:57:24.520]  yes this is the woman rewarded with a government role to enforce equality diversity turns out
[3:57:24.520 --> 3:57:29.080]  though she basically hates white people of course she does that's why she's been given the job
[3:57:29.080 --> 3:57:35.240]  in a spiegel article she wrote that Germans resemble potatoes that's the perfect candidate to
