[00:02.960 --> 00:09.200]  Maybe the establishment doesn't know it due to their narcissism and their symbiotic CDC
[00:09.200 --> 00:15.360]  FDA Pfizer cash cow that they're shooting up into their veins. But no matter how many bots
[00:15.360 --> 00:21.280]  try to prop it up on Twitter, the world is no longer buying the vaccine lockdown great
[00:21.280 --> 00:27.280]  reset prison planet lie anymore. Many Americans are under vaccinated,
[00:27.280 --> 00:34.160]  meaning they are not up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. Not all people over the age of 50
[00:34.160 --> 00:39.520]  have received their first booster dose. Of those who received their first booster dose,
[00:39.520 --> 00:46.880]  only 28% of those over 50 have received a second booster dose. And of those over the age of 65,
[00:46.880 --> 00:53.120]  only 34% have received their second booster dose. So my message right now is very simple.
[00:53.120 --> 00:59.760]  It's essential that these Americans, as Dr. Shaw said, get their second booster shot right away.
[00:59.760 --> 01:08.000]  Everybody wants to put this pandemic behind us and feel and hope that it doesn't exist. It does.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.440]  The Johns Hopkins pandemic study showed that the lockdowns did more harm than good.
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.680]  Hundreds of people under 40 are going into cardiac arrest and suffering from sudden adult
[01:19.680 --> 01:25.840]  death syndrome. Athletes are dying. Countless vaccine injuries and deaths are all over Twitter.
[01:25.840 --> 01:31.760]  Media and advertising panic as blood clot gaslighting is coming out of the woodwork.
[01:31.760 --> 01:37.280]  Still birth numbers are skyrocketing, while the ineffective vaccines themselves can't
[01:37.280 --> 01:43.520]  compete with natural immunity. And recently, a Swedish study revealed what had been relegated
[01:43.520 --> 01:50.560]  to conspiracy theory to be absolutely horribly true. The first demonstration in a human
[01:51.520 --> 01:59.760]  hepatic or liver cell line that the Pfizer vaccine in fact reversed transcribes and installs DNA
[01:59.760 --> 02:06.000]  into the human genome. Basically, there's an enzyme that can take that messenger RNA vaccine
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.120]  information and put it into the DNA of the person. The spike proteins and the chemicals in these shots
[02:11.120 --> 02:15.920]  are breaking down the blood-brain barrier. And as that gets broken, we could actually measure
[02:15.920 --> 02:23.600]  something called tau proteins, spelled T-A-U, tau proteins in the blood as an acute independent
[02:23.600 --> 02:28.800]  marker of cognitive dysfunction. So these people that you're seeing that can't talk,
[02:28.800 --> 02:33.440]  can't finish sentences are really grasping for different types of things that they didn't do
[02:33.440 --> 02:39.040]  before. And this is just one element of the neurocognitive decline. The other is the
[02:39.040 --> 02:43.440]  cardiovascular markers and what we're seeing with myocarditis. I wrote another article on my
[02:43.440 --> 02:49.120]  sub-stack about myocarditis. And all of these things are happening. And Alex, these are just two
[02:49.120 --> 02:55.840]  of 1,100 different things. To add to the massive violation of the Nuremberg code, even the mass
[02:55.840 --> 03:02.800]  not only never worked, but research is now showing that mass don't protect you, but may actually
[03:02.800 --> 03:10.320]  make you sick. Using CDC data, researchers with the University of Louisville calculated total
[03:10.320 --> 03:17.440]  COVID-19 case growth and mass use for the U.S. No significant differences were found in case
[03:17.440 --> 03:24.160]  growth between mandate and non-mandate states during periods of low or high transmission.
[03:24.160 --> 03:31.440]  The widespread use of mass did not reduce COVID-19 transmission in Europe. COVID-19 case rates in
[03:31.440 --> 03:38.560]  Kansas, counties with a mask mandate, had significantly higher COVID-19 case fatality rates
[03:38.560 --> 03:45.440]  than counties without a mask mandate. One way mass caused harm may be the Foggan effect. The idea
[03:45.440 --> 03:52.640]  that deep re-inhalation of droplets and virions caught on face masks might make COVID-19 infection
[03:52.640 --> 03:59.440]  more likely or more severe. In fact, Dr. Shana Swan, a professor of environmental medicine
[03:59.440 --> 04:04.960]  and public health at Mount Sinai Health System, warned in a book that phthalates,
[04:04.960 --> 04:11.520]  a chemical commonly used in the manufacturing of plastics, can shrink penises and decrease
[04:11.520 --> 04:17.360]  male fertility. Fauci and company need to prepare for the inevitable repercussions they cannot
[04:17.360 --> 04:24.320]  escape. Everyone knows or will soon know that the entire pandemic response has been a blatant
[04:24.320 --> 04:31.200]  ruse that created 500 new billionaires, crippled our economy, exponentially killed and injured
[04:31.200 --> 04:38.880]  millions, and decimated our educational system by design, first battle in a war on modern civilization

[06:14.720 --> 06:17.440]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[06:20.640 --> 06:24.640]  When I grow up, I want to launch the global rebellion against the new world order
[06:24.640 --> 06:28.640]  and the mark of the beast and I want to win.
[06:37.680 --> 06:44.640]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the eruption.
[06:46.880 --> 06:53.360]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance.
[06:53.360 --> 06:55.360]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[06:58.720 --> 07:00.320]  Liberty is rising.
[07:05.280 --> 07:09.360]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday July 14th transmission.
[07:10.320 --> 07:16.080]  All right. Huge news. Mask is off. New world order. Mark of the beast to buy and sell. All
[07:16.080 --> 07:22.320]  publicly being announced and rolled out. National news in the UK, Europe, the US, Japan announcing
[07:22.320 --> 07:26.880]  you will take microchips to buy and sell. Remember Klaus Schwab just said that on French TV
[07:26.880 --> 07:34.000]  five years ago. It's all happening, but the awakening is happening as well. Big, big, big
[07:34.720 --> 07:38.160]  broadcast. Some big guests I'll tell you about coming up next segment, but let me just
[07:38.160 --> 07:44.320]  break down what's happening. Massive announcements of lockdown twos coming in the fall as we warned
[07:44.320 --> 07:50.160]  you they were planning. It's been announced. Huge stack of critical intel. Massive stack on the
[07:50.160 --> 07:55.600]  great reset by design destroying the global economy. China on the verge of total.
[07:57.120 --> 08:02.720]  Revolt. They already have massive revolt runs on banks. You name it. China on verge of violent
[08:02.720 --> 08:07.440]  debt jubilee as his grunt old home buyers refused to pay their mortgages. It is all going down.
[08:08.640 --> 08:16.400]  Meanwhile, we've got US news, UK news, all of them saying any team that is mainly white is bad
[08:16.400 --> 08:22.560]  and that whiteness is bad. BBC reporter highlights problem of English female football team being
[08:22.560 --> 08:29.120]  white. England women are superb, but they're all white. Why and should this be fixed? That's
[08:29.120 --> 08:34.640]  Yahoo news. Just total brainwashing. Meanwhile, the president of the National Woman's Law Center
[08:34.640 --> 08:41.920]  won't define what a woman is. Total divide and conquer. Just 18% of Americans say Biden should
[08:41.920 --> 08:48.320]  run for president 2024. A new low in Gallup. That's all coming up. Huge Hunter Biden developments.
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.920]  Massive secret human cloning operation news with Jeffrey Epstein,
[08:53.920 --> 09:00.320]  Nygard and others breaking. We've got that. Governor Newsom. Well, Biden's gone going to the
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.280]  White House and pretending to be the new president as they get him ready to replace Biden. It's all
[09:05.280 --> 09:17.280]  coming up today. But in a major sign of the global awakening on Apple video, Apple TV,
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.320]  which is the second largest platform, the first place has been offered. Alex's war and independent
[09:22.320 --> 09:30.880]  documentary is now number two in pre-orders only behind Top Gun Maverick ahead of Jurassic Park,
[09:30.880 --> 09:35.600]  ahead of the Justice League, ahead of it all. And some listeners I see them coming in for say,
[09:35.600 --> 09:43.040]  why should you support Apple? It's a culture war. And the avant-garde cutting edge of the
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.200]  resistance is film. That's the arena they're trying to keep us out of. They've blocked the
[09:47.200 --> 09:51.600]  makers from advertising it on Google and Twitter. They have blocked the makers. And it's a very
[09:51.600 --> 09:56.800]  fair film. It's cinema verite. It's flying on the wall. But it's an example of how hungry people
[09:56.800 --> 10:05.520]  are for liberty on the hip hop national charts in the top 10 songs for our anti-hunter Biden
[10:05.520 --> 10:09.520]  New World Order. We played one the other day. That's approaching number one on the charts. Just
[10:09.520 --> 10:15.040]  another illustration of how liberty is so popular. And how if you're not a public figure, which is
[10:15.040 --> 10:20.400]  a blessing, by the way, but you don't know how awake people are, you feel alone. Believe me.
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.840]  Believe me. I can go to downtown Austin. It's liberal in San Francisco. And I might shake 100
[10:25.840 --> 10:30.080]  hands before one person drives by and says, F you Russian agent, you need to go to prison.
[10:31.840 --> 10:36.400]  Or, oh, you lost your kids, which isn't even true. I won't custody of my children. I mean, just, you
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.840]  know, they spout a handful of stop, attack and say any hook kids or families never did. You know,
[10:41.840 --> 10:48.560]  you're a Russian agent, you know, stuff like this. When I go to small towns, whether it's in
[10:48.560 --> 10:54.160]  Oregon or whether it's in Minnesota or whether it's in upstate New York or Florida, I'll be the
[10:54.160 --> 10:59.760]  gas station in the middle of nowhere in central Florida. And half of the people, Hispanic, black,
[10:59.760 --> 11:02.640]  white, you name it, come up and shake my hand and say, we appreciate what you're doing. That's not
[11:02.640 --> 11:07.520]  Alex Jones saying, Oh, I'm famous. I'm cool. I'm a winner. No, no, I want you to know the awakening
[11:07.520 --> 11:13.040]  is gigantic. And you hear the listeners call in that we're an Alex Jones writing shirt or an
[11:13.040 --> 11:18.800]  acting shirt or an informer shirt. And they say they get 99 to one positive. They get mobbed
[11:18.800 --> 11:25.520]  everywhere. So I mean, this is a real indicator that let me let me just give you some of the facts
[11:25.520 --> 11:30.160]  here. And this is God at work. God always showing me that it's God in control and that it's not me
[11:30.160 --> 11:36.480]  and it's not you. It's got at the end. We got a $7 million in donations in the last four months
[11:36.480 --> 11:41.200]  from an anonymous Bitcoin donor. The media said 9 million. But the time we sold it 7 million.
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.840]  And we were we were behind four or five months in bandwidth bills and a bunch of others. And that's
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.920]  what I was on air saying. We are desperate. We need money in it. I sold my house, put all that
[11:49.920 --> 11:54.240]  money in because I bought a nice house knowing that it would go up in value, doubled in value,
[11:54.240 --> 11:59.200]  sold it. My wife wasn't too happy. But I said, Hey, I didn't like this big thing. Anyways,
[11:59.200 --> 12:04.160]  I love our, you know, still have a nice house we moved into, but much more homie and then the
[12:04.160 --> 12:08.560]  thing we got. And I did that as an investment. That money's all been committed into the steel.
[12:08.560 --> 12:14.560]  So I've put $10 million that 7 million is all in now. And the 3 million from my house sale
[12:14.560 --> 12:20.000]  is 90% in. I've got like a couple hundred thousand dollars left from that. And I'm putting an end
[12:20.000 --> 12:26.800]  today into info wars into free speech systems. Because I know how God operates. I have faith.
[12:26.800 --> 12:31.360]  I've seen it over and over again. I'm not worried about the fact that, you know, in a month or two,
[12:31.360 --> 12:36.080]  I won't be able to pay my bills because that's not how I judge myself and how I measure myself
[12:36.080 --> 12:39.840]  by how much money I have. It's the effect we have and standing up and being honorable. And
[12:39.840 --> 12:43.440]  what would my ancestors, who I know can see what's happening, what would they say to me about
[12:43.440 --> 12:48.880]  what I'm doing? And they would say great job. It went up tears in their eyes. So that's what
[12:48.880 --> 12:56.400]  this is about. But here's the good news and the bad news. We had some good national manufacturers
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.400]  of high quality supplements, but left us bottom and wouldn't do business with a C more and we had
[13:00.400 --> 13:06.880]  supply chain breakdowns. Four of our six manufacturers wouldn't do business with a C more the last year.
[13:06.880 --> 13:14.240]  Total next level censorship. We got two now top firms, one of them, one of the smaller,
[13:14.240 --> 13:20.640]  but still huge national pharmaceutical companies. And the owner is a listener. They said, you know
[13:20.640 --> 13:25.840]  what? Just give us your top products and we'll do it all. And you just pass when it's ready.
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.960]  They're delivering it early. So we have nine products coming in the next two months.
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.120]  And it's just a total blessing, but I can do the math. It'll take a few months to get those
[13:37.120 --> 13:46.000]  products in. Bodies came in first, vitamin, and real fusion next week. Then then DNA force.
[13:46.560 --> 13:53.200]  But I will personally in one month be completely maxed out. And I'm already telling the career
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.960]  right now, there might be a point where I say, sorry, we'll get your paycheck in a month. I mean,
[13:56.960 --> 14:04.400]  we are to that point of just nipping tuck right up the line like a sudden death overtime NFL game.
[14:04.720 --> 14:08.240]  I mean, this is like the best game you ever watched. That's how God does it, where it's just
[14:08.240 --> 14:13.440]  right to the moment, right to the second we need it. We get it. It's like jumping across hot lava
[14:13.440 --> 14:18.240]  on stepping stones. And as you jump on each one and jump away, that one goes under the lava like
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.360]  a movie or like a Mario Brothers video game, and you're just jumping to the next one. So
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.320]  I need you to go to infowarstore.com and get great products you already need.
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.680]  We're selling our amazing hair and beard formula. It's really a super strong vitamin, mineral,
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.960]  you know, total complete system for adults and children. High quality, organic, best there is.
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.360]  I thought this would be a great seller. I make decisions around here. It was a horrible seller.
[14:43.360 --> 14:49.200]  Nobody bought it till I offered it at 75% off. That's below cost. Despite that, it's going to sell
[14:49.200 --> 14:55.040]  out by Monday. We're still offering at 75% off because I just got to get funds in here. I know

[15:21.360 --> 15:25.280]  for your joints, for inflammation, for everything, it is incredible. And when you forget to take it,

[15:29.040 --> 15:36.160]  effect. I've lost 37 pounds this last few months. So bodies is back in stock infowarstore.com

[17:50.480 --> 17:57.840]  for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for
[17:57.840 --> 18:01.920]  men. I go and see him quite often now. Ladies and gentlemen, high quality,

[18:44.800 --> 18:50.160]  high quality preparedness items and survival items right now at preparewithalix.com that again,
[18:50.160 --> 18:55.360]  redirects to preparetoday.com. I would not procrastinate, ladies and gentlemen. One of the
[18:55.360 --> 18:59.760]  most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the inflation is just beginning.
[18:59.760 --> 19:07.760]  Introducing the newest product from infowarslife.com. We are so proud of InfoWarslife immune support.
[19:07.760 --> 19:15.360]  It is concentrated herbs that are known on record to supercharge our body's natural defenses.
[19:15.360 --> 19:19.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that is essential and everyone should get,
[19:19.680 --> 19:24.640]  and on top of it, it funds the InfoWarslife so that's a 360 win. Let me tell you what is in
[19:24.640 --> 19:30.560]  this amazing product. Concentrated elderberry, concentrated echinacea, concentrated astragalus
[19:30.560 --> 19:38.480]  root, angelica root, loatium root and more. This product is incredible. InfoWars immune support
[19:38.480 --> 19:44.560]  exclusively available at infowarsstore.com is funding the tip of the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.760]  It is a 360 win. The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product
[19:49.760 --> 19:54.240]  to boost your body's natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air. The globalists are hoping
[19:54.240 --> 20:03.680]  you don't take action. Take action now, infowarsstore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[20:03.680 --> 20:25.120]  New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:33.680 --> 21:03.120]  Everything we do is about
[21:03.920 --> 21:10.560]  exposing the globalists and lazing the target. Everything we do is about exposing who is behind
[21:10.560 --> 21:15.680]  this worldwide corporate digital market of these takeover which is now operational out in the open.
[21:16.320 --> 21:20.160]  And thanks to this audience of incredible activists and it's not about giving you credit,
[21:20.160 --> 21:25.440]  it's about knowing you did it so you'll fight even harder now and realize how damn important you are.
[21:26.480 --> 21:32.160]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night talking about this incredibly important issue of the ESGs.
[21:32.160 --> 21:35.840]  That's a corporate global governance system and I have Klaus Schwal making new announcements here
[21:35.840 --> 21:40.160]  in a moment about how they will control where you can spend money, what you can do, and what
[21:40.160 --> 21:45.200]  businesses can operate. And it's what bankrupted Sri Lanka and Spain and now they're moving it to
[21:45.200 --> 21:50.000]  Canada, the US, Germany, the Netherlands, you name it. Here it is. And it's not just happening,
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.200]  by the way, in the third world. It's happening even in rich countries. The Netherlands, for
[21:53.200 --> 21:58.000]  example, is a very rich country, the second biggest food exporter in the world, tried to do for reasons
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.600]  that are not clear but may have to do with Western guilt. The same thing that leaders in
[22:01.600 --> 22:06.000]  Sri Lanka tried to do. They just ordered farmers to cut virtually all of their nitrogen oxide
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.800]  emissions to, quote, save the environment. Now doing that would shutter most farms in the Netherlands
[22:10.800 --> 22:17.600]  and destroy the country's food supply. And once again, that led to riots. So everything that's
[22:17.600 --> 22:24.240]  happened in Sri Lanka and Ghana and the Netherlands is happening at the behest, not simply of ideologues,
[22:24.240 --> 22:29.040]  but of some of the largest financial institutions in the world. They want more of this. It's why
[22:29.040 --> 22:36.960]  Ghana has achieved a near-perfect ESG environmental impact score of 97.7. According to world economic
[22:36.960 --> 22:44.800]  research, Sri Lanka has an ESG score of 98.1. The Netherlands, 98.7. So the poorer you get,
[22:44.800 --> 22:50.400]  the more human suffering there is, the higher your ESG score. And that's important because
[22:51.280 --> 22:58.720]  companies will not invest unless you have a high ESG score. Interesting. So these countries have
[22:58.720 --> 23:03.840]  no choice. And that's why South Africa, for example, works so hard to get an ESG score that now totals
[23:03.840 --> 23:10.160]  91. Now that effort began in 2015 when South Africa switched to renewables. Now how did that work?
[23:10.160 --> 23:13.520]  Well, like everything in South Africa, no one in America really wants to know.
[23:13.520 --> 23:18.000]  It's their favorite country. It's a huge success. What's life like in South Africa for people of
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.200]  all colors? Stop. Well, the Guardian of all places reported at the time when we're quoting,
[23:25.200 --> 23:29.920]  solar biomass and wind energy systems are popping up all over the country and feeding the clean
[23:29.920 --> 23:34.880]  energy into the strained electrical grid. So their grid's been falling apart since 1994. But no
[23:34.880 --> 23:40.880]  problem. The green energy geniuses are going to save South Africa. How'd that work? Well,
[23:40.880 --> 23:44.560]  seven years later, the Washington Post reports that South Africa regularly experiences, quote,
[23:44.560 --> 23:49.760]  rolling blackouts that last eight hours or more, crippling economic activity and disrupting life
[23:49.760 --> 23:53.040]  in this nation of 60 million people. And that's true. Ask anyone who lives there.
[23:53.040 --> 24:00.320]  It's falling apart. Doesn't work. But it's a transition the Department of Energy had and
[24:00.320 --> 24:07.360]  the Department of Transportation had said and Biden said and Merkel said and Boris Johnson said
[24:07.360 --> 24:13.280]  and they all said and Justin Trudeau said. It's the ESGs. It's designed to collapse things. You
[24:13.280 --> 24:20.400]  know, I went out to eat for a business meeting in downtown Austin two nights ago at a Chinese food
[24:20.400 --> 24:26.320]  restaurant. The best in Austin is excellent. And it's by the way, it's owned by Chinese expats
[24:26.320 --> 24:30.080]  that are big listeners. So we I'm having all this free food, shoveled at me and they're
[24:30.080 --> 24:34.080]  trying to bring me drinks. I'm like, no, I'm not drinking. Thank you. Just an example of
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.800]  the way people are and the power goes out. And everybody leaves. We wait. I said, they're just
[24:38.800 --> 24:43.840]  getting used to it. It'll turn back on in 30 minutes. It turned back on. My wife was along
[24:43.840 --> 24:48.560]  a business meeting was quite impressed. I said, give it about five minutes. This is all a setup.
[24:48.560 --> 24:53.360]  Yeah, the grids are failing because they're not being given the coal and the power they need to
[24:53.360 --> 24:57.840]  run it and they know it's going to shut off. They told us last weekend was shot off Monday and it did.
[24:59.520 --> 25:03.840]  I said two days ago, I guess that's three days ago. So that's where we are.
[25:05.680 --> 25:09.920]  It's a plan. They admit it's a plan for a post-industrial world. It doesn't put you
[25:09.920 --> 25:13.520]  onto a new system. It collapsed the system you're under. And here is a video. It's up
[25:13.520 --> 25:21.120]  on info wars.com where the WEF no longer even hides what they're doing. They're out in the open.
[25:21.120 --> 25:25.680]  Here it is. We're going to have to think about a recalibration of a whole range of human rights
[25:25.680 --> 25:30.400]  that are playing out online. Individual carbon footprint tracker. Many of these things will
[25:30.400 --> 25:38.000]  be built directly into our bodies. It's a hostile corporate takeover of your body and a digital
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.200]  surveillance censorship dictatorship. President Eisenhower tried to warn us about this
[25:43.200 --> 25:51.200]  years ago, the hostile takeover of a scientific technological elite. They provide much more
[25:51.200 --> 26:01.280]  powerful intelligence for decision making. Can a microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body
[26:01.280 --> 26:08.800]  to track his every movement? You will rule on that. The next phase is the surveillance going
[26:08.800 --> 26:15.040]  under our skin. Now that we've cracked the code of life, it will not take much longer before we
[26:15.040 --> 26:25.440]  can start to play God. The new powers that we are gaining now, especially the powers of biotechnology
[26:26.000 --> 26:33.680]  and artificial intelligence, are really going to transform us into gods. It's a total complete
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.040]  AI takeover of every fast human life, like a Ferrari and others have been saying.
[26:42.960 --> 26:49.360]  Given all the technological developments, it might be feasible, even easy, to support people,
[26:50.080 --> 26:55.600]  even if they don't work, to give them a universal basic income, to give them enough food, enough
[26:55.600 --> 27:03.840]  medicine and so forth. The big question is meaning, what will they do all day? And one of the answers
[27:03.840 --> 27:10.160]  is that they will just play computer games all day, virtual reality games. They will spend more
[27:10.160 --> 27:18.400]  and more time playing virtual reality games that will give them much more excitement and emotional
[27:18.400 --> 27:25.920]  engagement than anything in the real world outside. So what I see is a huge disruption
[27:25.920 --> 27:31.360]  that is before we get to the world that human envisage and his description of the future,
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.960]  there's going to be a complete destabilization of the human condition and of human society.
[27:36.960 --> 27:45.280]  This is not going to happen quietly. So they lock you up in your house and the World Economic
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.720]  Forum announced today a partnership with Facebook that they will control what you see in the metaverse.
[27:50.720 --> 27:54.320]  So your only job is in the metaverse, you can't leave your house because of viruses,
[27:54.320 --> 28:00.000]  robots live everything. But don't worry, we're just making you independent or dependent on us
[28:01.200 --> 28:05.680]  so that we can help you know they want to kill you, they want to make you obsolete,
[28:05.680 --> 28:11.200]  that's their plan. We've got all of it when we come back, the Klaus Schwab announcements,
[28:11.200 --> 28:16.880]  everything, it is out of the open. They don't want you to be independent, they want you to be
[28:16.880 --> 28:23.760]  dependent on them, they want to control every facet of your life to then make you obsolete
[28:23.760 --> 28:29.520]  and then kill you. Oh, all these poor people, we're going to give them video games and VR. Oh,
[28:29.520 --> 28:36.400]  really, that's why the future didn't need us. April 1999, Wired Magazine, Bill Joy, code owner
[28:36.400 --> 28:42.320]  MicroSystem said, I went to a meeting with over 200 tech CEOs and we said we're not going to have
[28:42.320 --> 28:46.160]  the public play video games when they're obsolete, we're going to kill them, we're going to kill them
[28:46.160 --> 28:53.520]  with injections. It's in the damn article, why the future doesn't need us. Bill Joy, 1999,
[28:53.520 --> 28:57.120]  we'll be right back with your calls, I'm going to take calls today and more, stay with us.

[31:14.800 --> 31:20.160]  off of your driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful now, we're selling it to

[33:01.120 --> 33:07.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:07.120 --> 33:15.760]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone
[33:15.760 --> 33:21.120]  have the cure. If your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon?
[33:21.120 --> 33:29.200]  A newly elected government seeking power and control develops a secret bio-weapon and launches it
[33:29.200 --> 33:35.840]  against its own population to establish authoritarian rule and to blame the attack
[33:35.840 --> 33:42.320]  on their political enemies. Taking pages right out of the 20th century, we see this
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.840]  fictional dictatorship not just seeking to dominate and control the population,
[33:47.840 --> 33:54.480]  but to be seen as saviors of the very people that they are dumbing down, enslaving,
[33:55.040 --> 34:02.400]  imprisoning, and killing. The writers had a deep historical well to work from
[34:02.400 --> 34:10.960]  in just the 20th century, with monsters like Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, Fidel Castro, Hugo
[34:10.960 --> 34:17.760]  Chavez, Kim Jong-un, who don't just seek to dominate and control the very lives and thoughts
[34:17.760 --> 34:24.240]  of their minions, but who also want to be seen as the savior by the very people who are their slaves.
[34:24.240 --> 34:30.000]  Tonight, I will speak directly to these people and make the situation perfectly clear to them.
[34:30.000 --> 34:35.440]  The security of this nation depends on complete and total compliance.
[34:35.440 --> 34:40.960]  So, of course, in the film, those that release the bio-weapon on their own population that
[34:40.960 --> 34:44.080]  they're preying on also have the cure.
[34:44.080 --> 34:50.080]  Lo and behold, American, some believed it was the work of God himself,
[34:50.080 --> 34:55.360]  that it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all
[34:55.360 --> 35:00.800]  obscenely rich. But the end result, the true genius of the plan was the fear.
[35:02.000 --> 35:05.600]  The fear became the ultimate tool of this government, and through it, our politician
[35:05.600 --> 35:10.160]  was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of high chancellor.
[35:10.160 --> 35:15.120]  In V for Vendetta, we truly see art imitating life.
[35:15.120 --> 35:21.040]  This is clearly an offensive, biological warfare agent.
[35:21.040 --> 35:25.840]  This is only the beginning to train you to be locked down so in the future, when the really
[35:25.840 --> 35:30.720]  deadly bio-weapons are released and billions begin dying, you sit there believing governments
[35:30.720 --> 35:35.200]  and corporations are actually your savior and are going to shepherd you and protect you when,
[35:35.200 --> 35:37.920]  in truth, they're Judas Goats leading you into the slaughter.
[35:37.920 --> 35:47.920]  Powerful, powerful report.
[35:59.440 --> 36:02.240]  Darren Median, Revolver News, is going to be joining us with big
[36:03.680 --> 36:07.520]  breaking information concerning the deep state's plan to try to suspend the next election
[36:07.520 --> 36:12.480]  in 117 days and arrest President Trump. That's coming up next hour.
[36:15.200 --> 36:18.800]  And then Matt Bragg is going to be popping in. He had been on the show and over a year,
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.520]  he was the guy that said, hey, people might need to storm the Capitol when he gets those
[36:23.520 --> 36:26.960]  to show. I didn't know he said that on the show. I'm not saying he's a fed. I'm not saying he's a
[36:26.960 --> 36:32.400]  bad guy. I'm just saying it was very interesting that he said that when he's always been a very
[36:32.400 --> 36:40.560]  non-confrontational guy. He'll be explaining that coming up when he pops in on the broadcast as well.
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.360]  But Darren Beatty is only going to spend 30 minutes. Matt Bracken is going to actually,
[36:45.360 --> 36:52.800]  I wanted him at 130. So Matt Bracken is at 130. That means I can intersperse phone calls in between
[36:52.800 --> 36:56.800]  those times. And that's what we're going to be doing here today.
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.920]  I'm going to give the number out at the start of the next segment.
[37:04.160 --> 37:09.600]  And I specifically want to ask listeners and viewers about what are you planning to do
[37:10.480 --> 37:17.920]  when they launch the next lockdown coming up here in just a few months. I've got the articles
[37:17.920 --> 37:21.760]  where they're planning it, where they're announcing it. It's all here. That number,
[37:21.760 --> 37:24.560]  that toll free number will be given out at the start of the next segment. So let's look at some
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.120]  of these headlines. The U.S. industrial complex is starting to buckle from high power cost.
[37:29.840 --> 37:36.240]  That's very simple. That's the great reset. World Economic Forum paper. Gas prices must go higher
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.400]  to save democracy. Yes, make you poor so they can control you. Transition to green energy, which is
[37:43.120 --> 37:48.480]  all anti-carbon, is key to both tracking climate change and creating sustainable economies. Here's
[37:48.480 --> 37:57.120]  why banning all human activity. Mexican presidents, as Americans, living costs can be saved by going
[37:57.120 --> 38:03.600]  to Mexico and buying your gasoline. WEF pushes for restricting certain types of actors and
[38:03.600 --> 38:10.720]  transactions from using decentralized finance. They want a global body. They control who can
[38:10.720 --> 38:18.080]  buy and sell. Yep, Margaret the Beast. London's Heathrow Airport caps daily passengers at 100,000
[38:18.800 --> 38:25.040]  to save carbon. If carbon dioxide is so bad for the planet, why do greenhouse growers buy
[38:25.040 --> 38:32.560]  CO2 generators to double plant growth? And Politico says pay raises being frozen and
[38:32.560 --> 38:37.840]  making less money is good to stop inflation once the central banks that are causing it all.
[38:37.840 --> 38:44.800]  Dutch farmers rise up against food system reset. Here's the article I mentioned with Politico.
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.240]  There's one hopeful sign for the federal inflation. Reality.
[38:52.640 --> 38:58.000]  Pay raises are bad. If carbon dioxide is so bad, I mentioned this. Here's the article
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.120]  for the planet. Why do greenhouse growers buy CO2 generators to double plant growth? Natural news.
[39:03.120 --> 39:11.280]  This is where we are, ladies and gentlemen. I hope the depopulation will occur in a
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.360]  civil and peaceful way. WEF Mastermind, Club of Rome founder, publicly states.
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.240]  And here's a graphic showing you can put 8 million people, the UN says they're about to hit,
[39:24.240 --> 39:33.760]  with three feet apart in a grid and it would fill up this tiny dot that is Los Angeles.
[39:37.920 --> 39:41.360]  Now, let's look at the COVID news that ties all into this with the World ID
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.120]  and the control system because the vaccine passport is the nexus to all of this.
[39:46.400 --> 39:50.560]  WHO Director General wants you to put the slave mask back on.
[39:50.560 --> 39:55.600]  John Bowne does a report. Even the mask makes you sick.
[40:00.320 --> 40:07.840]  Macron, minority government defeated on vaccine passports. French government votes to not
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.960]  have a national ID tied to the vaccine passport and kills it. And for all the tyranny and arresting
[40:12.960 --> 40:19.200]  people in restaurants and cafes, now this has happened. Big victory. Corporate media hyping
[40:19.200 --> 40:24.800]  the midterm variant. It was Ninja last week. Now it's the midterm variant as COVID is the most
[40:24.800 --> 40:34.000]  dangerous yet. Biden signs a $137 million deal for COVID test to start producing 83.3 million tests
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.600]  a month. Is they're going to hype up COVID or get rid of it? No, they're going to bring it all back.
[40:39.600 --> 40:46.160]  Beijing scraps China's first COVID vaccine mandate in just 48 hours after furious social
[40:46.160 --> 40:53.120]  response. Fauci acknowledges vaccines don't protect overall well against COVID infection.
[40:53.120 --> 41:02.400]  Oh, really? But he's calling for mask indoors yet again. And Rand Paul accuses Biden
[41:03.840 --> 41:11.120]  and his COVID reassurgence, doomers of sensationalism. Think so? And then now from the World Economic
[41:11.120 --> 41:17.680]  Forum, would you implant a tiny debit card chip in your hand if you got special discounts?
[41:17.680 --> 41:26.960]  That from the Daily Mail. And it goes on and on and on and on. Oh, and Bill and Melinda Gates made
[41:26.960 --> 41:34.720]  a record level donation to their own tax-free foundation. How nice of them. And all over the
[41:34.720 --> 41:41.840]  world, record orders for child-sized caskets as babies and children begin to be given the deadly
[41:41.840 --> 41:54.240]  shots. I'm going to give the number out when we come back. And then I'm going to get to this stack
[41:54.240 --> 41:59.760]  of reports, the attack on the family, the attack on women, the attack on men, the attack on humans.
[41:59.760 --> 42:05.520]  Again, president of National Women's Law Center won't define what a woman is, just like the Supreme
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.880]  Court nominee, who is now Supreme Court Justice Wooden. In the World Health Organization, gender
[42:10.880 --> 42:16.640]  is not limited to male and female. Insane video. Dem pro-abortion witness declares it
[42:16.640 --> 42:24.960]  incites violence to say men can't give birth. And the World Economic Forum calls for the
[42:24.960 --> 42:31.120]  metaverse to be controlled by them as they force you into this grid. It's all coming up. And this
[42:31.120 --> 42:34.640]  report, before we go to calls, I forgot to tell the crew to grab this because I'm going to cover it
[42:34.640 --> 42:41.200]  Monday. I didn't. Shock video. TV producers interview real vampires. Wait till you see that
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.640]  and you will eat the bugs. All this sounds dystopic. All this sounds insane. None of this sounds real,
[42:46.640 --> 42:52.560]  but it is. We're going to cover shock vampires. TV producers interview real vampires. When we
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.760]  When we come back on the other side to get that video ready, we'll be right back.
[43:25.440 --> 43:30.640]  For the final 75 people become founding members for this big project we're launching in the near
[43:30.640 --> 43:36.720]  future. You'll also get a personal signed piece of art I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[43:36.720 --> 43:45.280]  and a personal message. It's your last chance to get all three coins at 1776. This is history
[43:45.280 --> 43:52.080]  happening now. Info War States, your support is changing the world and this is the final 75
[43:52.080 --> 43:58.080]  three point set exclusively available at 1776 point dot com.
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.600]  sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going on both
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.280]  at home and the world at large. If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all
[44:11.280 --> 44:18.080]  use more of our new sleep support formula down and out. It's just the thing. It's our new faster
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.360]  absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you get the shut eye you deserve.

[44:29.040 --> 44:34.720]  herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution. So the
[44:34.720 --> 44:40.080]  ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it. One of the other sleep
[44:40.080 --> 44:45.920]  support herbs included is the passion flower, which was traditionally used by Native Americans
[44:45.920 --> 44:51.360]  like the Cherokees who used it for its relaxing qualities. Be sure to take this product when
[44:51.360 --> 44:59.200]  you are completely ready for sleep because you will be down and out. Selling out now at infowarstore.com

[47:03.840 --> 47:29.840]  New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:44.640 --> 47:51.840]  The thrill is gone. The thrill is gone away.
[47:51.840 --> 48:01.840]  The thrill is gone, baby. The thrill is gone away.
[48:05.840 --> 48:13.840]  You know you've done me wrong, baby. And you'll be sorry someday.
[48:14.880 --> 48:17.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to know who we're dealing with,
[48:17.840 --> 48:23.440]  you want to know what we're up against. I'm going to lay it out right now for you.
[48:24.720 --> 48:30.080]  They want us to give up on our dignity. They want us to give up on our humanity.
[48:30.880 --> 48:34.800]  They want us to not care about each other so they can isolate us individually
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.200]  and do whatever they want to us. You think I like collapsing Africa
[48:39.200 --> 48:44.080]  and hundreds of millions of poor Africans they can brainwash and use as political slaves
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.600]  coming in here? No. I don't hate those black people.
[48:50.320 --> 48:54.560]  You think I like them collapsing Latin America for two plus years with lockdowns
[48:54.560 --> 48:58.480]  and then brainwashing them and flooding us with communism? Absolutely not.
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.040]  You think I hate those brown people? No, I love them because I love myself because I know God
[49:03.040 --> 49:09.760]  loves them and I got the Holy Spirit. But I've used this analogy 500 times and I'll use it for
[49:09.760 --> 49:18.880]  the 500 first. If I lived in some mountain valley with a big old Hoover Dam on it and I love water,
[49:18.880 --> 49:23.120]  I love to take basins, I love to drink it, I love to swim in it, I love to look at it.
[49:23.920 --> 49:28.480]  But if somebody detonated a small nuclear weapon on Hoover Dam and then those hundreds of
[49:28.480 --> 49:34.160]  billions of gallons of water came rushing down as a destructive force, I don't want to be killed by
[49:34.160 --> 49:46.400]  that water. It's the same thing. So, we first exposed Jeffrey Epstein 15 years ago and a decade
[49:46.400 --> 49:51.280]  ago I told you Harvey Weinstein was branding women and they had sex cults because all they
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.880]  want is power over people and I had Hollywood sources that were high level, I mean household names.
[49:56.880 --> 50:04.560]  Tell them me about it and it wasn't Charlie Sheen. I knew Charlie Sheen through Martin Sheen and
[50:04.560 --> 50:10.560]  Emilio Estevez who invited me to their house because they liked my films and then I got to know
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.040]  Charlie and then but when I talk about Hollywood, it's not Charlie Sheen I'm talking about because
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.160]  I don't care about Hollywood or any of that but they tried to recruit me into it.
[50:21.760 --> 50:25.440]  You know, Tom Cruise grew up for over a couple of years living with the Sheens
[50:25.440 --> 50:34.880]  and it's that whole group of people. It's Brad Pitt, I mean it's all of them and I've been
[50:34.880 --> 50:43.280]  at those parties with all those people from old to young. Oh look, Jack Nicholson's here.
[50:46.720 --> 50:49.680]  Oh look, Anthony Hopkins is going to sit down and eat roast beef with you.
[50:49.680 --> 50:57.360]  Yeah, I've sat down and I've eaten roast beef at Martin Sheen's house with his wife serving
[50:57.360 --> 51:03.280]  roast beef to us. It was an interesting experience. I thought I would eat my liver with a
[51:04.000 --> 51:12.000]  farver beans and a nice Q&A but the point is is that for at least 10 years,
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.720]  any time I wanted to go out to LA, I could stay at these people's houses
[51:14.720 --> 51:24.080]  and I got to learn what they were being told and what was going on and what was
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.320]  going on in the future. Not from Martin Sheen or Charlie Sheen or me,
[51:28.320 --> 51:32.000]  like I said those are the people that I've been known to know but the other people
[51:32.000 --> 51:41.520]  know. And so when we see an article
[51:43.520 --> 51:47.440]  in TV reports like this one, shocked video of TV producers interviewing real vampires,
[51:47.440 --> 51:53.200]  that's my headline but it's these beautiful black women sitting around with Peter Nygaard
[51:53.200 --> 51:58.720]  who worked with Epstein, the rest of them and I told you Epstein was involved in human cloning
[51:58.720 --> 52:05.760]  and they were cloning humans to then suck all their blood out and suck all their stem cells out
[52:05.760 --> 52:14.720]  and injecting themselves and the very best clones, the very best stem cells come from
[52:14.720 --> 52:23.280]  your baby or your clone. So they were taking people's genetics and they claim in their studies
[52:23.280 --> 52:28.240]  injecting it to black women's eggs and the black women's eggs were the best to actually
[52:28.240 --> 52:34.320]  create a human which then the woman would grow in her womb and then Peter Nygaard would suck
[52:34.320 --> 52:40.400]  the blood out of and the stem cells out of and inject in his ass and George Herbert Walker Bush
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.440]  and Obama and all of them went to Nygaard's facility and reportedly had this done and
[52:45.440 --> 52:54.800]  here's what's frustrating, that's on record that they did that. This isn't just about raping little
[52:54.800 --> 53:01.680]  kids folks, this is about creating human clones growing them in women and then sucking those babies
[53:01.680 --> 53:08.000]  dry for these vampires. They don't drink the blood of a baby like the archetypal Count Dracula or
[53:08.000 --> 53:19.040]  Nosferatu in your bedroom at night. They suck the babies their own clones dry so the genetics
[53:19.040 --> 53:24.720]  matches them and that's the ambrosia they're talking about. And here's one of the national TV shows
[53:24.720 --> 53:30.480]  that hit the cutting room floor that shows exactly what Epstein and Nygaard and the rest of them are
[53:30.480 --> 53:36.000]  up to. These are the real vampires.
[53:38.000 --> 53:43.120]  The stem cell technology that Peter and I are investing in is called SCNT which takes the
[53:43.120 --> 53:49.520]  egg of a young, perfect woman specimen, takes the egg and takes out the nucleus. Since there's
[53:49.520 --> 53:58.400]  art, DNA in the nucleus, they just want to take it out. This is part of this genetic
[53:58.400 --> 54:07.600]  greatness that we don't see in any other race on the planet. These curvy, sexy black women from
[54:07.600 --> 54:15.440]  Africa. You girls have a kind of a monopoly on this genetic perfection and we want some of that.
[54:18.560 --> 54:23.440]  So girls, for $100, pay you for your egg.
[54:23.440 --> 54:37.440]  How much do you want for it? Let's pay it. I built $500. Whoever I paid, he's gonna have to pay me.
[54:37.440 --> 54:44.800]  I bought a book, $60,000 worth of eggs. If you have a portion, that's very valuable.
[54:44.800 --> 54:54.000]  I built a cord at the center. In a period of time, it's so rich with stem cells.
[54:54.880 --> 55:02.320]  We regard it as waste and it actually should be captured as recycled. It shouldn't go to waste.
[55:03.520 --> 55:07.920]  It's life for somebody else. It's life for mankind.
[55:07.920 --> 55:14.720]  Those are the best eggs out of 60 to 18 years old. Those are the best eggs. As you get older,
[55:14.720 --> 55:20.960]  your eggs get bigger and bigger. Yeah, thank you. So you may not be out of your way.
[55:20.960 --> 55:23.520]  No, that's fine. I don't like it this way.
[55:24.800 --> 55:31.600]  Cloning yourself with the idea of making yourself immortal, I think, is a science fiction
[55:31.600 --> 55:43.200]  and I think it's unethical. They were attested this practice in mice and also fat and got six
[55:43.200 --> 55:50.000]  back when he was jumping all the women, you know, young, right? You know, at first it's just everybody
[55:50.000 --> 55:55.440]  safe and after that. Oh, son of a bitch.
[55:55.440 --> 56:02.960]  So that's the video on Manda video, shock video to producers, interview real vampires.
[56:02.960 --> 56:06.160]  They're lit. The women are totally grossed out of a radio listener. You didn't see it.
[56:06.160 --> 56:09.840]  Two of you saw they're totally grossed out of these gross old men. But the thing is,
[56:09.840 --> 56:18.960]  they got thousands of women to create clones of these rich men, grow them and they pay them
[56:18.960 --> 56:26.240]  50 to $100,000 for the baby that they would then kill and drain for its juices.
[56:28.160 --> 56:29.040]  That's what they just said.
[56:32.320 --> 56:37.920]  And they put TV shows out on camera bragging about how they've done it.
[56:37.920 --> 56:41.520]  So when you ask me who we're facing, that's who we're facing.
[56:41.520 --> 56:48.480]  These are the same genetic engineers that want to take over our bodies and put
[56:48.480 --> 56:52.080]  these gene therapies into us. They want to play God. These are mad scientists.
[56:52.080 --> 56:55.040]  We're going to go to break. We're going to open the phones up.
[56:56.240 --> 57:05.200]  We're going to take your phone calls. The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[57:05.200 --> 57:19.360]  877-789-2539 specifically on the Great Reset and the New World Order and where you see all of this
[57:19.360 --> 57:25.600]  going. And I've got more with them saying, we can't say what a woman is because if you can
[57:25.600 --> 57:29.520]  end what men and women are, you can define whatever you want and do whatever you want.
[57:29.520 --> 57:35.680]  It's coming up next hour, 877-789-2539. That's a very important Gregory's report coming up.
[57:35.680 --> 57:41.280]  And then your phone calls and then Dr. Darren Beattie with big breaking news and then another
[57:41.280 --> 58:00.640]  special guest today, Matt Bracken, infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[58:28.480 --> 58:34.720]  So the only way you fail is not taking action today and ordering bodies ultimate tumor formula
[58:34.720 --> 58:43.840]  at infowars.com. It is simply amazing. Discover the power of your humanoids at 95% at infowars.com
[58:43.840 --> 58:52.960]  today with bodies ultimate tumor formula. I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or pump gas
[58:52.960 --> 58:57.520]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire. Fortune and Money
[58:57.520 --> 59:01.920]  Magazine have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[59:01.920 --> 59:07.200]  30 different answers. 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And almost all of them
[59:07.200 --> 59:12.320]  just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the
[59:12.320 --> 59:16.560]  system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this. So it's
[59:16.560 --> 59:20.800]  a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody
[59:21.600 --> 59:26.720]  to be able to do things tax wise. It's legal and lawful that allows you to keep
[59:26.720 --> 59:32.720]  more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[59:32.720 --> 59:39.760]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com, one word, jonestaxrelief.com,
[59:39.760 --> 59:56.720]  or call 833-904-285-833-904-285. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:56.720 --> 1:00:11.520]  What we are seeing in Sri Lanka is system failure. And that is nothing to celebrate. There is no
[1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:18.800]  victory in system failure. In fact, it is what these tyrants are counting on. It's part of the plan
[1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:26.000]  and it's been their business model for decades. As simple as the mafia movies on TV. The World Bank
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:32.560]  and the IMF, strong arm world leaders into accepting loans are designed to bankrupt the nation.
[1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:39.200]  While the CIA acts management, secretly administering to the overthrow of national sovereignty
[1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:45.040]  and of the nation's wealth. This international mafia organization has been doing like this for
[1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:51.120]  years because it always works. They know that once the people become a hungry angry mob,
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:57.680]  they can be controlled like animals. And this reactive behavior is exactly what these globalist
[1:00:57.680 --> 1:01:03.200]  crooks are counting on. It's why they are destroying the world's economies and creating
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:10.640]  a food crisis. So the answer is to become proactive. And that is exactly what the Dutch
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:16.800]  are now showing us. How the people of the world can achieve victory against the tyrants of the
[1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:23.200]  New World Order. The prolific farmers of the Netherlands are the second biggest food exporters
[1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:29.680]  in the world. And they know that the World Economic Forum is planning on buying up their land and
[1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:35.840]  cutting off the food supply for billions of people. And they also know that the people united
[1:01:35.840 --> 1:01:43.280]  are an unstoppable force. And so they united against tyranny and peacefully with unstoppable
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:50.480]  strength shut down the system. The shelves in many stores are now empty, but it's on their terms.
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:56.640]  And the people now have the upper hand as it should be and could be everywhere if we want it.
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:03.040]  The New World Order's plan is for all nations to collapse, which tells us that we must not
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:09.920]  wait until system failure. We must act now. Many people all over the world are now starting to
[1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:17.360]  rise up together with the Dutch farmers, rising up not as a reactive, hungry, angry mob, but as a
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:24.960]  righteous people united in a love for humanity. Society is made up of we the people and we must
[1:02:24.960 --> 1:02:31.760]  now peacefully take control of it. This is the path to victory and time is quickly running out.
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:39.520]  The lockdowns are coming back. The pandemic isn't over. As we've said, the pandemic
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.000]  is not over. We need more money to plan for the second pandemic. There's going to be another
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:50.240]  pandemic. We have to think ahead. China has announced five more years of lockdowns. And if
[1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:56.560]  you're awake by now, then you know they're coming back everywhere with quarantine camps and forced
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:03.840]  business closures all designed to mentally break us and collapse society. If we were to believe
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:10.240]  that we are powerless and weak or domesticated pets, then yes, the only path would be to wait
[1:03:10.240 --> 1:03:16.320]  until the food runs out and then join the angry mob. But if we were to believe that we were righteous
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:23.280]  and powerful, then we would just fix it. So what's the plan, fellow humans? Do we wait for the
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:31.120]  inevitable collapse and lose everything, celebrating system failure? Or do we learn from the Dutch
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.560]  and take control of everything and fix the system so that it serves we the people?
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:47.040]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[1:03:47.040 --> 1:04:02.480]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:07.440]  and chemicals added to the food. It's all come out. And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[1:04:07.440 --> 1:04:13.040]  but because we're made the image of God, the Creator. And we are powerful. And the social
[1:04:13.040 --> 1:04:18.880]  engineers fear that so much. So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows
[1:04:18.880 --> 1:04:27.600]  who first came up with the boy, is it true? The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation
[1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:32.400]  was hopeless. They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all
[1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:39.360]  their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on
[1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:44.240]  the God of this world who is a loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep Infowars
[1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:48.800]  in the air now more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:53.920]  manifesting and setting up is satanic. And we are opposing the one world government and the

[1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:14.720]  Look, I know that everybody tuned in to this show knows that January 6th was a provocative event
[1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:19.040]  to make our peaceful protests look bad and you're sick of hearing about it. But the Democrats are
[1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:23.840]  betting everything they've got on it and trying to outlaw their political opposition. So we've
[1:06:23.840 --> 1:06:27.520]  got our guests on for just a little while and we're going to be going to your phone calls and
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:34.640]  covering all the other big news here today on the Alex Jones show. As mainline institutions,
[1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:40.720]  universities, you name it, say women are not women. What's really behind that? As the president of
[1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:46.800]  the National Women's Law Center won't define what a woman is. But I wanted to hit this news
[1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:50.560]  because we've played the clips a thousand times. We're not going to play it again.
[1:06:50.560 --> 1:06:57.360]  Probably I've played it 500 times. Ray Epps is running around the day before January 6th and on
[1:06:57.360 --> 1:07:01.920]  January 6th saying go into the Capitol, go into the Capitol right when the breach happens. Our own
[1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:07.920]  Owen Shroyer has been charged as facing years in prison for being with me peaceful at the Capitol
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:16.240]  trying to stop it. So how is Owen Shroyer charged facing prison time? But Ray Epps is running around
[1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:23.200]  doing this. Well, the New York Times had a big piece yesterday about how he's a victim of conspiracy
[1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:29.760]  theory and they never quote him or never show what he actually said or did. What's behind that?
[1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:34.960]  Meanwhile, ex-Trump spokesperson said the former president liked the crazies when Alex Jones,
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:40.320]  L.A. Alexander, January 6th speakers, despite red flags, she raised. So this is what they're
[1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:47.680]  having in this kangaroo committee. So I'm sick of it. You're sick of it. But there's something big
[1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:53.840]  behind it. And Dr. Darren Beatty is a former professor of political science, a Trump advisor,
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:59.920]  and he is here to lay this out. Why is January 6th so important to them? What's coming next?
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:05.440]  And what do you make of the historic show trials that would make Joseph McCarthy blush?
[1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:12.320]  Well, those are all very important questions. I like to start by addressing the New York Times
[1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:17.520]  piece. And first of all, I think it's really important to appreciate, just let it sink in.
[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:30.000]  Of all of the January 6th riot participants, there's a single one about whom the New York Times
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.960]  decided to write a sympathetic piece, not just a sympathetic piece, but a puff piece. And that's
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:44.160]  Reyes. The singular person caught repeatedly since January 5th, the evening before, urging people to
[1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:49.840]  go into the Capitol and who was there the next day directing people to the Capitol and who was
[1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:56.560]  right there at the initial breach point. That is the person that the New York Times decides to write
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:02.000]  a puff piece about. And that's alone pretty shocking. But I want to get into the details
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:08.640]  of the actual piece so everyone can understand what an egregious mop up job this is. There's
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:14.960]  journalism and there's being a janitor. There are journalists and janitors who mop up dirty deeds
[1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:21.280]  of the federal government. And this is a janitorial exercise, the likes of which I didn't even think
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:28.320]  the New York Times was capable. So first of all, the sympathy is amazing. Oh, life has been held.
[1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:36.080]  Poor Reyes. Life has been held. He's getting bad press. People are criticizing him and so forth.
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:41.520]  Well, what about Michael Perna, who committed suicide in prison? What about all the guys?
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:48.400]  Everyone, they decide to cover Reyes's sob story and he's not even in prison. It's pretty amazing.
[1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:55.440]  A couple of things. This is a rehabilitation piece for Ray Epps. And yet in the entire piece,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:03.760]  one cannot find a single explicit denial on the part of Epps of any association with
[1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:09.520]  military intelligence, Department of Homeland Security, Joint Terrorism Task Force,
[1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:17.280]  or other cut out or intermediary groups thereof. In fact, the only thing we really see is references
[1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:25.840]  generally to lies. Epps's desire that the truth come out. And the author, Alan Foyer, referencing
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:31.440]  Ray Epps's statement to the committee, alleged statement to the committee from a lawyer that
[1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:36.480]  he was not involved with any law enforcement agency emphasis on law enforcement. All of the
[1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:41.920]  organizations I just described, Intel organizations, Department of Homeland Security, Joint Terrorism,
[1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:47.680]  Task Force, Military Intelligence, none of that is law enforcement. So why the weird,
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:54.160]  explicit mention of law enforcement and why not just a blanket denial?
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:01.920]  Did the author of this piece, who got unique access to Ray Epps to do this interview,
[1:11:01.920 --> 1:11:08.160]  did he ask for a denial? And if he did, what happened? And if not, why didn't he ask? We don't
[1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:15.840]  know this at the time. It's not reflected in the piece. Secondly, the piece describes Ray Epps as
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:23.280]  a disappointed Trump supporter. He's a disappointed Trump supporter. He, along with one of his sons,
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:29.920]  just did a last minute trip to the Capitol to support Trump and to go listen to Trump's speech.
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:36.240]  Well, here's the only thing. Ray Epps, as far as we know, did not go to the speech. Here is the
[1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:44.080]  alleged Trump supporter, Ray Epps, who traveled all the way from Arizona to Washington DC and
[1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:50.400]  doesn't even attend the speech, certainly not the full speech. And instead, he uses his time
[1:11:50.400 --> 1:11:57.760]  to advance this bizarre mission to go into the Capitol beginning the night before January 6
[1:11:57.760 --> 1:12:04.240]  itself. Does Allen Foyer, the author of the piece, who describes Ray Epps as a Trump supporter,
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:09.680]  who is going there to listen to Trump's speech, ask, well, if you're going there to listen to
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:13.840]  the speech, why did you not attend it? Did you attend it? Did you attend the full thing?
[1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:21.920]  As far as we're aware, the author of the janitorial exercise, the janitor, does not ask these questions.
[1:12:23.040 --> 1:12:30.000]  Most importantly, how did Ray Epps get the idea to go into the Capitol in the first place?
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:36.720]  Isn't that kind of weird? He's the only person in that iconic video saying, we need to go into
[1:12:36.720 --> 1:12:43.440]  the Capitol who has remotely thought of this idea. Everyone else thinks it's shocking, scandalous,
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:50.960]  ridiculous, and they were so immediately put off by it that the immediate response was to call him
[1:12:50.960 --> 1:12:58.960]  a fed. And so where did Ray Epps get this idea? Did it come out of nowhere? Where did it come from?
[1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:06.640]  And why was he so doggedly insistent on pursuing it despite the radically low buying temperature of
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:11.200]  the crowd around him? That's a very important question. That's right. They're yelling at him
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:16.240]  the night before the day, calling him a fed. And so Owen Shroy is charged with being outside the
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.400]  Capitol, trying to stop people going in. But Ray Epps says, go in the Capitol, go in the Capitol,
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:27.440]  all these videos. He's a dear little angel. Right. Alex, just one more thing. So Allen Foyer had
[1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:33.760]  access to Ray Epps. He was interviewing him. Did he think to ask Epps, where did you get the idea
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:40.400]  to go into the Capitol? That would seem to be a fundamental question to ask, so fundamental
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:49.120]  that to not ask it amounts to a commission of profound journalistic malpractice. Did Allen
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:56.000]  Foyer ask this? Well, if he did, it's not reflected in the piece at all. And finally, and here's a big
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  whopper for you, Alex, is that this guy, Ray Epps, his behavior was so egregious that he was
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:14.560]  immediately a target of the addition hunter, sort of left wing investigative sort of semi vigilante
[1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:22.320]  organization. His behavior was so egregious that he was listed as one of the first 20 people on
[1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:28.000]  the January 6 FBI most wanted list. And his behavior was so egregious. This is this will shock
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:36.880]  you. His behavior was so egregious that in the New York Times, his own video documentary on January
[1:14:36.880 --> 1:14:45.760]  six, explosively titled Day of Rage, Ray Epps is depicted and referred to as one of the rioters
[1:14:45.760 --> 1:14:53.760]  who had a plan to storm the Capitol all along. The New York Times's own video documentary on
[1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:59.680]  January 6 depicts Epps as someone. So the government has a rehabs they have a rehabs problem,
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:06.320]  they're trying to rehabilitate him right now. Right, but but just like let this point seek in.
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:12.160]  Now we have the New York Times basically dismissing anyone who brings up questions about Epps as a
[1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:18.080]  ridiculous baseless conspiracy theorist. When the New York Times itself in its own video documentary
[1:15:18.080 --> 1:15:25.440]  on January 6 depicts Ray Epps and refers to him through the narration as one of the rioters who
[1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:30.640]  knew about the plan and plan to storm the Capitol all along. Alright, there are meetings stay there
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:34.160]  doc. I want to come back and finish up on where this is going because everybody's like yeah,
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.880]  we know January 6 is staged. Why do we care? Well, they're basing their whole political takeover
[1:15:38.880 --> 1:15:43.360]  on January 6. That's why it's important. And why are they having a front page article
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:47.920]  propping him up right now saying it's preposterous. That's why he's running around like a chicken with
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.160]  his head cut off saying go into the Capitol. It's just incredible. Well, so many people that
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:56.080]  didn't even go into the Capitol. And we're trying to stop it like Owen Troyer have now been charged.
[1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:04.480]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first three coin founding member series,
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:09.840]  George Washington slaying the dragon. Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally
[1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:17.440]  the second amendment come and take it Molon lobby point. There are only 75 points left in the three

[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:27.280]  products he mentions info war store dot com is where to get them folks and we do have the best
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:32.000]  supplements. I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information.
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:38.880]  We do the best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula
[1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:44.240]  folks. This is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away at 75% off. By the way, it works for
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:50.400]  me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard formula is working for me quite well.
[1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:56.560]  I might add quite well. My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men. I go and see
[1:17:56.560 --> 1:18:02.240]  him quite often now. We brought the game changing product previously only available to major oil
[1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:08.080]  companies around the world to the civilian market two years ago, the bio pros for septic tanks for
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:13.920]  porta potties for RVs for your drains, your boats, it goes on and on. It'll eat the oil off of your
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:20.000]  driveway if you just add water. But it's been so successful. Now we're selling it to major RV parts,
[1:18:20.800 --> 1:18:27.440]  pig farms, you name it, because this stuff will eat anything that is organic. And it's
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:34.560]  exclusively available at the bio pros dot com. And now info war store dot com. We sold out of this
[1:18:34.560 --> 1:18:40.880]  for almost a year, but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock for whatever your need is

[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:56.560]  scams again. This film can stop them if you take action info wars store dot com 2000 mules.
[1:19:56.560 --> 1:20:22.800]  Watch leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:28.880]  So the power structure is scared right now. They're in a full panic. Why would they have a huge
[1:20:29.760 --> 1:20:35.200]  New York Times article and others saying Ray Epps is this angel. He's this wonderful person
[1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:42.480]  running around on January 5th, January 6th, all over DC and at the Capitol saying go in,
[1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:47.600]  go into the Capitol. And now we have a clip coming up in a moment of AOC admitting that the police
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:51.760]  open the doors up and let those people in. So peaceful people that went in, they're in jail
[1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:57.200]  still or charged with serious crimes or only shortly try to stop the event. He's charged. But
[1:20:57.200 --> 1:21:04.240]  Ray Epps isn't and we're told not to look into him. Why are they so scared of people looking
[1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:10.080]  into Ray Epps? Dr. Darren Beatty. That's a great question. Now it's in the simple answer. The
[1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:18.000]  simple and just striking answer is that look Ray Epps is the smoking gun of the entire fed
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:26.320]  direction. If it turns out as it really looks like it's the case that Ray Epps was not an authentic
[1:21:26.320 --> 1:21:33.200]  actor on that day, but rather was acting according to a plan that was given to him by some third
[1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:39.440]  party perhaps associated with intelligence, perhaps in an agency or an intermediary or cutout
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:47.840]  or cutout of one of those agencies, the entire establishment narrative on January 6th collapses
[1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:55.040]  in one fell swoop. Ray Epps is the smoking gun. And as bad as it's gotten in terms of the narrative
[1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:01.520]  on Ray Epps, I have every expectation that it will get even worse. And that certain elements,
[1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:07.200]  including this New York Times reporter, probably know that it's going to get a lot worse and indeed
[1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:12.640]  have hinted as much that certain aspects of the official narrative will change as a result of
[1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:19.360]  changed testimony. And we could be learning a lot of things that only reinforce are already quite
[1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:26.400]  clear understanding that the Ray Epps story doesn't add up. And so in order to get in front of this,
[1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:33.200]  I think this is the part, the opening throw of a massive damage control campaign that's going to
[1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:39.200]  attempt to make any mention of Ray Epps in any context that contradicts the official narrative
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:45.280]  so toxic as to become impossible. Well, they say that they say we're getting ready to sue anybody
[1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:50.080]  that questions Ray Epps and what he was doing, they really don't want us to talk about Ray Epps.
[1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:55.520]  Right. No, I mean, they're bringing out all the tools and there's certainly an implicit
[1:22:55.520 --> 1:23:03.200]  ret of lawsuits, defamation suits. But look, you know, it's, it's one of those things that
[1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:10.320]  the case is pretty solid. I mean, Epps is on video doing the things that reporters,
[1:23:10.320 --> 1:23:14.720]  including myself was listening to the problem early on to be looked at. So justice be done,
[1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:19.440]  may the heavens fall. But they went so overboard, not even pointing out in the piece that he said,
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:27.600]  going to the Capitol. And I mean, it's ridiculous. It's remarkable, but it shows how sloppy and
[1:23:27.600 --> 1:23:32.720]  desperate they are, because if they feel the need to bring all of this additional and renewed
[1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:40.000]  tension, attention on Epps right now, I can only imagine how bad the forthcoming revelations will
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:47.520]  be that the author of this piece is kind of implicitly anticipating and feeling the need to
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:56.800]  undertake this really unbelievable exercise in janitorial damage control. But most Americans
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:01.440]  are like, we know a million people showed up in D.C. We know only 800 or so in the Capitol,
[1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:05.680]  most peaceful waiting by police say, why do we care? Because they're betting their whole political
[1:24:05.680 --> 1:24:11.680]  outlawing of Republicans, a populism of censorship of declaring Republicans terrorists, they're
[1:24:11.680 --> 1:24:16.720]  betting the whole rollout on January 6. That's why January 6 is so important. No, no, Alex,
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:24.160]  no, no, this is it's impossible to exaggerate the importance of this. Just as 9 11 was the
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:35.760]  pretext to build up a new and robust and invasive national security state. January 6 is used as a
[1:24:35.760 --> 1:24:44.960]  pretext for the full scale reorientation, repurposing and political weaponization of that
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:53.360]  national security state domestically to silence, suppress and destroy anyone who supports Trump
[1:24:53.360 --> 1:25:00.000]  or is adjacent to movements that are associated with Trump. That's what's at stake here. There's
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:05.280]  too much riding on this false feds erection narrative. And that's why they will protect
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:11.520]  that narrative at all costs. Even if it means be clowning oneself in a ridiculous piece for
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:19.520]  somebody like Ray Epps, they will pull out all the stops to shut up any information that embarrasses
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:26.480]  their corrupt and manifestly false official narrative on January 6. I agree, but if they were
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:30.160]  smart, they would have just let it alone. This this is not going to blow the story back up.
[1:25:30.960 --> 1:25:33.200]  Well, that's what I'm saying. He didn't do anything.
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:38.800]  To give them the benefit of the doubt that it wasn't just a tremendous
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:45.520]  unforced error. If it seems stupid for them to re up the Ray Epps story now, that can only
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:51.040]  indicate that there's going to be very embarrassing revelations coming in the near future that they
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:57.680]  feel they need to get ahead of such that they're even willing to undergo this otherwise inexplicably
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:03.200]  embarrassing effort in damage control right now. That's that's my only speculation. Otherwise,
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:08.800]  it doesn't make sense. Maybe it's an unforced error like you described. Maybe it's an act of
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:14.720]  necessary a necessary act of desperation because they know that as bad as it's already gotten,
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:20.720]  as a result of revolvers reporting Tucker, you and you know, a handful of others who have been brave
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:27.600]  enough to that is it's been because of that, it will get even worse as we move into the January
[1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:35.280]  6 trials as we learn more as various text messages come out as we gain more clarity into the
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.640]  circumstances leading up to that initial and decisive breach on the west side of the Capitol.
[1:26:42.240 --> 1:26:46.560]  For me, it was surreal to watch the hearings and they're acting like I wanted to attack the Capitol.
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:51.920]  They omit the footage of us trying to stop people going in the Capitol. I mean, it's just it's such
[1:26:51.920 --> 1:26:59.440]  a rigged event. It's shameful. Absolutely. Now it's it's rigged event. It's ridiculous. It's
[1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:05.040]  a charade, but it's dangerous. And everything is at stake along the lines of what I described.
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:11.120]  Ray Epps, the smoking gun of Ray Epps threatens to collapse the entire fed
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:16.960]  direction narrative. That's why they're going in full mobilization mode to protect the narrative,
[1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:21.920]  especially that's why they're probably gonna let's see what so let's see what happens. Let's see what
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:27.280]  happens. Unfortunately, I have to run, but I hope I hope everyone will go to revolver.news.
[1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:33.280]  Read the full piece and watch the videos. We've added some special new videos that really expose
[1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:39.760]  what's going on with Epps, a full definitive takedown of the janitorial exercise in the New
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:44.800]  York Times. Everyone should check it out. It's right at the top. It's white hot that revolver.news.
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:47.680]  Yeah, that's what we mentioned, the hidden agenda behind the New York Times desperate
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.800]  puff piece on Ray Epps. All right, Dr. Beatty, thank you. Thank you so much. All right, we're
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:56.720]  going to come back and we're going to go to your phone calls. And I'm also going to hit the story
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:01.040]  I've been mentioning for an hour everywhere. They're saying women are not women. What is behind
[1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:08.080]  that? We're going to cover that and then go to Markell and Chris and Brian and HB and Spencer
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:13.840]  and Mitch and Josh and Tyler and Jennifer and Joe and Jason. But again, the general audience is
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:18.960]  like, Hey, man, we know January 6th, we know it's a stage thing. Why are you covering it?
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:25.520]  Because they're betting their whole system takeover on it, banning protesting stolen elections,
[1:28:26.880 --> 1:28:36.480]  banning questioning anything they do based on this. And so that's why it's important to expose.
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:40.000]  We're going to shift gears, the attack on men and women in your phone calls
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:46.480]  straight ahead as we enter the great reset in the New World Order info wars.com news wars.com

[1:30:57.360 --> 1:31:26.360]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is. But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. Crill oils is the best. And it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm sorry. You want something like this. You don't get stuff for free.
[1:31:26.360 --> 1:31:52.360]  The Crill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view. I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something. I eat five capillots of Crill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is. So we don't make a big profit off of it. But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do it.
[1:31:52.360 --> 1:32:21.360]  So I did it. I signed up for the Austin Marathon. I've been training probably not as much as I should be. But thank goodness for prayer and thank goodness for info wars store dot com. Before I set out on a run, I throw down some turbo force to give me that energy I need to get going. You know, besides the energy turbo force, it is giving me the vitamins I need like vitamin C to keep me healthy.
[1:32:21.360 --> 1:32:42.360]  And the essential B vitamins plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training. And then every day now I'm taking Dr. Jones, sore less. I have bad joints. Thanks mom. So this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:58.360]  The quick release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training. Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news turbo force that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day and sore less can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[1:32:58.360 --> 1:33:25.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:30.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:45.360]  Live from the info wars dot com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:34:01.360]  All right, a lot of big breaking news here in just the last 10 minutes. And we'll take your calls right now and cover news and I'll have more of this next hour after I'm tired of the brakes to analyze it. But we've seen world leaders all the planet resigned last week.
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:17.360]  And we've seen a bunch of assassinations, not just the former Prime Minister Japan, whose party still in power and he was really still running the country. Mario Draghi, the Italian Prime Minister quits in shock resignation. He's a W E F globalist head.
[1:34:17.360 --> 1:34:31.360]  We have other major Prime Ministers that are also globalist stepping down, not just Boris Johnson, Bulgaria's outgoing PM rejects Russian ultimatum, but now has resigned.
[1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:38.360]  We had a bunch of these other ones coming in. This is big. This is big. So a lot of shake ups happening.
[1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:50.360]  This is crazy stuff going on. And as I told you on Monday, it's just getting started. This is this is economic war. This is a bunch of different factions. This is crazy.
[1:34:50.360 --> 1:35:00.360]  Now let's get to this. When you see the new Supreme Court justice, when she was in confirmation hearings asked, Can you define a woman? She said, No, I can't.
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:13.360]  When you see the BBC saying they can't do it, all these other publications and groups, because they're in La La Land, they're in gaslighting, and they've got to say a man can have a baby, two women can have a baby, because they're going to sell you transhumanism.
[1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:24.360]  They need to eat you totally confused, giving up your body, giving up common sense. So again, president of the National Women's Law Center won't define what a woman is.
[1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:36.360]  During testimony, the House laid a Supreme Court decision to hand back abortion laws to states. A pro-abortion witness would refuse to define what a woman is despite being asked to do so several times by Republican Congressperson.
[1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:41.360]  This is the head of the nation's Women's Law Center. Here it is.
[1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:48.360]  Since you are the president of the National Women's Law Center, I was hoping that you could define what a woman is for us in this committee hearing.
[1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:54.360]  Well, as the president of the National Women's Law Center, you can imagine I say woman a lot in my day job.
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:57.360]  Okay, so I'm just asking for the definition.
[1:35:57.360 --> 1:36:03.360]  And so what I'll tell you is I am my woman. That's how I identify.
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  But I wonder, however, if in part the reason that you're asking a question is that you're trying to suggest that people don't identify a woman.
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:13.360]  I am simply asking the question, and I simply want an answer.
[1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:22.360]  And so I think it's actually really important to be very clear here that there are people who identify as non-binary.
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:24.360]  I think about 5% of young people do.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:36.360]  We're not going to go there. I was hoping maybe you would say something that maybe we learned in high school biology that has to do with X and Y chromosomes, which define male and female.
[1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:38.360]  But I guess we're not going to get there.
[1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:43.360]  This is a cult, and here's the rest of the headlines.
[1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:47.360]  World Health Organization. Gender is not limited to male or female.
[1:36:47.360 --> 1:36:50.360]  And my wife was showing me this weekend on her email.
[1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:59.360]  She didn't even sign up to tampon maker ads, but they know she's a woman, so they sent her tampon ads.
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:04.360]  And she showed me three major tampon producers, and she sent me, I've got it on my phone.
[1:37:04.360 --> 1:37:08.360]  I meant to do a whole story on it. She wanted me to. I should do a story on it.
[1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:18.360]  And it says men can have periods, too.
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:23.360]  That's a cult, folks. That's brainwashing.
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:24.360]  Here's another one.
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:25.360]  Insane video.
[1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:30.360]  Dim Pro Abortion Witness declares it incites violence to say men can't give birth.
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:32.360]  Cue that video up, please.
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:37.360]  I forgot to tell the crew. Let me know when you have that.
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:40.360]  So this is the fantasy land they're creating.
[1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:41.360]  And here's an example.
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:47.360]  World Economic Forum calls for metaverse to have rules and standards that they run.
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.360]  So we're going to play that clip for you.
[1:37:49.360 --> 1:37:53.360]  Here's the radical pro-abortion activist by Democrats who was called to testify.
[1:37:53.360 --> 1:37:57.360]  A witness to the Citizens History Committee hearing on the legal consequences of the Supreme Court's
[1:37:57.360 --> 1:38:04.360]  Attorney Roe v. Wade declared that anyone who says men can't give birth is inciting violence.
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:08.360]  This is planet cuckoo, like during the Democrat debates.
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:13.360]  When multiple Democrats said, we need abortion funding for men.
[1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:20.360]  And the moon's made of cheese, and the Easter Bunny's real. Here it is.
[1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:23.360]  Professor Bridges, you said several times, you've used a phrase.
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  I want to make sure I understand what you mean by it.
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:28.360]  You've referred to people with a capacity for pregnancy.
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:31.360]  Would that be women?
[1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:35.360]  Many women, cis women, have the capacity for pregnancy.
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.360]  Many cis women do not have the capacity for pregnancy.
[1:38:38.360 --> 1:38:43.360]  There are also trans men who are capable of pregnancy, as well as non-binary people who are capable of pregnancy.
[1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:46.360]  So this isn't really a women's rights issue.
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:51.360]  We can recognize that this impacts women while also recognizing that it impacts other groups.
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:54.360]  Those things are not mutually exclusive, Senator Hawley.
[1:38:54.360 --> 1:39:00.360]  So your view is that the core of this right then is about what?
[1:39:00.360 --> 1:39:05.360]  So I want to recognize that your line of questioning is transphobic.
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:09.360]  And it opens up trans people to violence by not recognizing that.
[1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:14.360]  Wow, you're saying that I'm opening up people to violence by asking whether or not women are the folks who can have pregnancies?
[1:39:14.360 --> 1:39:21.360]  So I want to note that one out of five transgender persons have attempted suicide.
[1:39:21.360 --> 1:39:25.360]  Because of my line of questioning? We can't talk about it?
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:30.360]  Because denying that trans people exist and pretending not to know that they exist is injurious.
[1:39:30.360 --> 1:39:35.360]  I'm denying that trans people exist by asking you if you're talking about women having pregnancies?
[1:39:35.360 --> 1:39:38.360]  Do you believe that men can get pregnant?
[1:39:38.360 --> 1:39:40.360]  No, I don't think men can get pregnant.
[1:39:40.360 --> 1:39:42.360]  And that leads to violence.
[1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:45.360]  Is this how you run your classroom? Are students allowed to question you?
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:46.360]  Absolutely.
[1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.360]  Or are they also treated like this?
[1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:51.360]  Opening up people to violence by questioning.
[1:39:51.360 --> 1:39:54.360]  Oh, we have a good time in my class. You should join. You might learn a lot.
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.360]  Well, I've learned a lot. I've learned a lot.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:57.360]  I know.
[1:39:57.360 --> 1:40:00.360]  I know. This is what a cult looks like.
[1:40:00.360 --> 1:40:04.360]  This is a cult. These are lunatics.
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:07.360]  But it's created by big banks.
[1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  It's created by the power structure to absolutely get people to give up on their humanity and the family and everything else.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:15.360]  This is unbelievable.
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:22.360]  And then I've got these videos where, oh, here it is right here.
[1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.360]  But you know what? I'm going to hit that next hour.
[1:40:24.360 --> 1:40:26.360]  I'm going to go to break and come back with your calls.
[1:40:26.360 --> 1:40:31.360]  But BBC Reporter highlights problem of English female football team being white.
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  They're the best players. They're who's there.
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:38.360]  You don't look at a football team, an NFL, and like 80% is black and go, why are there a bunch of black people?
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:41.360]  They're the best at football. They got into it. They trained hard.
[1:40:41.360 --> 1:40:43.360]  They deserve the slot they're in.
[1:40:43.360 --> 1:40:47.360]  I'm going to ask why is 80% of the NBA black?
[1:40:47.360 --> 1:40:52.360]  But oh my God, this woman's soccer team is 90% white.
[1:40:52.360 --> 1:40:53.360]  We can't have that.
[1:40:53.360 --> 1:40:58.360]  And then Bloomberg and Yahoo, and they all picked it up and agreed, we cannot have a bunch of white people.
[1:40:58.360 --> 1:40:59.360]  White people are bad.
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:02.360]  Again, just training you for racial division.
[1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:04.360]  It is so sick. It is so evil.
[1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:06.360]  And it's what the big corporations are doing.
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.360]  That's coming up next hour.
[1:41:08.360 --> 1:41:10.360]  But first, we're going to continue on here.
[1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.360]  I'm going to take your phone calls when we come back.
[1:41:12.360 --> 1:41:14.360]  Let me just throw this out there.
[1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:18.360]  Our hair and beard formula for men is really for women as well.
[1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.360]  Of course, women can have beards as well.
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:22.360]  Men can have babies, too.
[1:41:22.360 --> 1:41:23.360]  I'm joking.
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:25.360]  The point is, it's really a high-quality multivitamin mineral.
[1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:28.360]  Highest end, it's a multivitamin mineral.
[1:41:28.360 --> 1:41:31.360]  And as soon as I started pointing that out, it's almost sold out.
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:36.360]  But despite the fact it's about to sell out, it's still being sold at 75% off at infowarstore.com.

[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:03.360]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:07.360]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.360]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[1:43:11.360 --> 1:43:13.360]  You might not agree with everything.
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.360]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[1:43:16.360 --> 1:43:19.360]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.360]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[1:43:20.360 --> 1:43:25.360]  infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:27.360]  And we do have the best supplements.
[1:43:27.360 --> 1:43:32.360]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:36.360]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.360]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:40.360]  Folks, this is a joke.
[1:43:40.360 --> 1:43:41.360]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:42.360]  It's 75% off.
[1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.360]  By the way, it works for me.
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:49.360]  In case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me.
[1:43:49.360 --> 1:43:51.360]  Quite well, I might add.
[1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:55.360]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:57.360]  I go and see him quite often now.
[1:43:57.360 --> 1:44:01.360]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds.
[1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:02.360]  I was overweight.
[1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:04.360]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe.
[1:44:04.360 --> 1:44:06.360]  I was barely holding onto a job.
[1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:09.360]  And I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it.
[1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:12.360]  So the first one I got was the original survival skills, the X1.
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:13.360]  And it worked pretty good.
[1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.360]  And then shortly thereafter, you came out with X2.
[1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:19.360]  You had, you know, with a deep burden source, you know, and I got really excited about that.
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:26.360]  So I took it and man, in two weeks, I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened.
[1:44:26.360 --> 1:44:29.360]  You know, I could think again, I could connect with people again.
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:33.360]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back
[1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:36.360]  and I religiously took basically all of your supplements.
[1:44:36.360 --> 1:44:38.360]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.
[1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:40.360]  The one I like recently is Knockout.
[1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:42.360]  It literally like if you want to sleep, just take it.
[1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:43.360]  It's amazing.
[1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:44.360]  It works.
[1:44:44.360 --> 1:44:46.360]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:49.360]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:52.360]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:53.360]  Beautifully said, brother.
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:56.360]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[1:44:59.360 --> 1:45:03.360]  Taking advantage of one of nature's most nutrient dense ingredients,

[1:45:57.360 --> 1:46:01.360]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:05.360]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:09.360]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:14.360]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:46:14.360 --> 1:46:18.360]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.360]  can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels,
[1:46:22.360 --> 1:46:24.360]  decrease the growth rate of plaque
[1:46:24.360 --> 1:46:28.360]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses
[1:46:28.360 --> 1:46:30.360]  in joints and the digestive system.
[1:46:30.360 --> 1:46:35.360]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:39.360]  can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:42.360]  and activity of immune cells.
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:47.360]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:50.360]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:46:50.360 --> 1:46:54.360]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:47:06.360]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:47:39.360 --> 1:47:41.360]  We're going to go to your phone calls right now.
[1:47:41.360 --> 1:47:43.360]  Let's talk to Markel in Washington.
[1:47:43.360 --> 1:47:44.360]  You're on the air.
[1:47:44.360 --> 1:47:45.360]  Thanks for holding.
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:46.360]  Yes, sir.
[1:47:46.360 --> 1:47:47.360]  Markel from the Circle.
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:48.360]  Hey, Alex.
[1:47:48.360 --> 1:47:50.360]  First, I just want to say God bless you, man.
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:53.360]  The name of the Messiah keep going.
[1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.360]  I'm a hip hop artist.
[1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:58.360]  So, you know, when I started looking into information
[1:47:58.360 --> 1:48:00.360]  more about what's been going on in the world
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:04.360]  and it was contrary to what we were being told to believe,
[1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:07.360]  you know, I got looked at a little bit, you know,
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:09.360]  with some side eyes and stuff.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:14.360]  But I realized that God had me that needed me to look for the truth
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:15.360]  and be a truth seeker.
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:19.360]  When I was in college, the last two months of college,
[1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.360]  I had to spend on Zoom classes because of all this
[1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:25.360]  and I was in Kirkland, Washington,
[1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:27.360]  where I believe one of the first,
[1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:31.360]  if not the first one of the first recorded COVID deaths was there.
[1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:36.360]  And so everybody that I was around was on high alert.
[1:48:36.360 --> 1:48:39.360]  But we started, at least I started to see it wasn't exactly
[1:48:39.360 --> 1:48:41.360]  what I was being told.
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:44.360]  And after I graduated, I went across the country
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.360]  and experienced like COVID life within the first couple of months
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:49.360]  of everything and stuff.
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:52.360]  And things in Washington got kind of bad.
[1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:55.360]  They wanted everybody to start showing passports
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:57.360]  and all that kind of stuff.
[1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.360]  The stores with the masks was too much.
[1:48:59.360 --> 1:49:00.360]  Oh yeah.
[1:49:00.360 --> 1:49:02.360]  This is all, this is all great reset.
[1:49:02.360 --> 1:49:04.360]  Margaret The Beast training wheels.
[1:49:04.360 --> 1:49:05.360]  Exactly.
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:09.360]  You know, and I've tried to talk to my pastor and stuff
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:13.360]  and I hope that everybody continues to become more aware.
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:16.360]  But listening to you and seeing what was going on around the country
[1:49:16.360 --> 1:49:18.360]  and who was handling COVID differently,
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.360]  I actually came down to Texas and moved to Dallas.
[1:49:22.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  And I've been doing my thing here and stuff.
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:25.360]  And it's been great.
[1:49:25.360 --> 1:49:26.360]  I love Texas.
[1:49:26.360 --> 1:49:28.360]  I've just received so much love here.
[1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:29.360]  Well, that's awesome.
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:32.360]  There's a lot of kick-ass rap exposing the new world order right now
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:33.360]  and hip-hop.
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:36.360]  Where do we find you, Mirkel?
[1:49:36.360 --> 1:49:38.360]  You can find me on all the stream platforms,
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:42.360]  Markel from the Circle, N-A-R-K-E-L-L from the Circle.
[1:49:42.360 --> 1:49:43.360]  All right, brother.
[1:49:43.360 --> 1:49:44.360]  Got to jump getting everybody.
[1:49:44.360 --> 1:49:45.360]  Thank you so much.
[1:49:45.360 --> 1:49:48.360]  Man in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:49.360]  Hi, Alex.
[1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:51.360]  I want to put this out there very quickly
[1:49:51.360 --> 1:49:54.360]  and then let you put it all together.
[1:49:54.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  But this is what I believe it's going to be the next agenda
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:01.360]  to make us a cashless society.
[1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:07.360]  I'm picking up on your topic of the debit card ship implant
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:13.360]  with the perk of a discount to society.
[1:50:13.360 --> 1:50:15.360]  That's not my prediction.
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:17.360]  They're saying that's the plan.
[1:50:17.360 --> 1:50:19.360]  Absolutely.
[1:50:19.360 --> 1:50:23.360]  I am 25 miles north of Houston in the Woodlands, Texas,
[1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:26.360]  and I read this bizarre story yesterday
[1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:30.360]  on the Montgomery County police reporter.com
[1:50:30.360 --> 1:50:34.360]  at Caney Creek High School, which is Conroe ISD.
[1:50:34.360 --> 1:50:38.360]  They have an unannounced but planned
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:43.360]  mass medical casualty drill at the high school,
[1:50:43.360 --> 1:50:48.360]  which shut down the highways and roads,
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:53.360]  used tied up crucial resources of personnel,
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:58.360]  firemen, police department, EMT,
[1:50:58.360 --> 1:51:02.360]  all in the name of this so-called planned
[1:51:02.360 --> 1:51:06.360]  but unannounced act of a poisoning.
[1:51:06.360 --> 1:51:11.360]  The school nurse calls in to the dispatch
[1:51:11.360 --> 1:51:14.360]  about a student being poisoned,
[1:51:14.360 --> 1:51:17.360]  and then when medics arrive,
[1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:21.360]  they find out that there's over 50 students that are poisoned.
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.360]  This theatrical, whatever you want to call it,
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:28.360]  lasts for three hours and really has the community concerned.
[1:51:28.360 --> 1:51:31.360]  They do drills and act like they're real,
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.360]  and then they did a bunch of drills
[1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:36.360]  right before the mass shooting, and now we have the footage
[1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:38.360]  of the police standing down for 77 minutes.
[1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:40.360]  We don't even know what really happened.
[1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:42.360]  Now, I want you to tie this in,
[1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:44.360]  because I'm uneasy about this last night.
[1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:47.360]  I wake up and I read an article on Fox News
[1:51:47.360 --> 1:51:50.360]  about a supposed Kentucky woman that claims
[1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:53.360]  that she's poisoned by handling a dollar bill
[1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:56.360]  that was laid by Sentinel.
[1:51:56.360 --> 1:51:58.360]  Now, that's it. They're getting us ready to ban cash.
[1:51:58.360 --> 1:52:00.360]  It's everywhere. I appreciate your call.
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:02.360]  Incredible points. Absolutely, brother.
[1:52:02.360 --> 1:52:04.360]  Psyop is everywhere. You can see what's coming next
[1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:06.360]  from the Psyop. Thank you.
[1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:08.360]  I can talk to each caller for 20 minutes,
[1:52:08.360 --> 1:52:10.360]  but we'll get to everybody, so I got to move quick.
[1:52:10.360 --> 1:52:12.360]  Let's talk to Spencer in Arizona.
[1:52:12.360 --> 1:52:14.360]  Spencer, you're on the air.
[1:52:14.360 --> 1:52:17.360]  Hey, Alex. Long time fan.
[1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:19.360]  I had just two questions.
[1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.360]  One question was, if communication systems went down,
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:26.360]  what would your plan be to continue broadcasting
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:28.360]  or do you have a plan at all?
[1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:31.360]  There is no plan. If they totally shut it all down,
[1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.360]  they'll only be approved, things are still on air,
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:35.360]  and we're going to be off the air.
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:37.360]  I don't have a plan for that.
[1:52:37.360 --> 1:52:40.360]  Okay, would you not use radio or ham?
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:42.360]  Yeah, I mean, I can try to use shortwave radio
[1:52:42.360 --> 1:52:44.360]  to give out Alex Jones' message to people.
[1:52:44.360 --> 1:52:46.360]  I've got a shortwave transmitter,
[1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:48.360]  but I mean, that's like trying to shoot an elephant
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:50.360]  with a pea shooter.
[1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:52.360]  Okay, second question.
[1:52:52.360 --> 1:52:55.360]  Everything we do now, like a ripple in the pond,
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:57.360]  a pebble in the pond, what we say now
[1:52:57.360 --> 1:52:59.360]  is what will be heard in the future.
[1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:02.360]  Whatever I talk about, if we don't win, it's going to happen.
[1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.360]  So people can take this show today,
[1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.360]  and in 10 years it'll be just as valuable or more.
[1:53:06.360 --> 1:53:08.360]  So you understand, I don't need to be on the air in the future.
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  I'm doing it all now. I'm leaving it all in the field.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  Gotcha. Okay, one quick question.
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  As you know, I'm sure Texas, if it were its own sovereign nation,
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:20.360]  would have the 13th largest economy in the world,
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.360]  and there's a lot of talk of Texas defeating,
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  and if that happened, no Republican would ever win
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:28.360]  in the United States again.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:30.360]  That's a strong hold for electoral votes.
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.360]  But I feel like this would be a really good move
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  against the globalists, because if Texas left,
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:38.360]  then so many red states would join it,
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:41.360]  and they would no longer have control over us.
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:44.360]  I like the plan of a new Declaration of Independence
[1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:47.360]  of the states pulling out of the captured D.C.
[1:53:47.360 --> 1:53:49.360]  to reconstitute the New Republic.
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:51.360]  Instead of seceding to leave,
[1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:54.360]  secede to point out that the government's been hijacked
[1:53:54.360 --> 1:53:57.360]  to then reform with the majority of states
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:53:59.360]  through a constitutional convention overriding the enemy.
[1:53:59.360 --> 1:54:01.360]  I appreciate your call.
[1:54:01.360 --> 1:54:03.360]  That's only one way to do it.
[1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:05.360]  Let's talk to Mitch in Texas.
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:07.360]  A lot of calls from Texas.
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:09.360]  Hey, Alex, can you hear me?
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  Yes, sir.
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:12.360]  Hey, just wanted to let you know,
[1:54:12.360 --> 1:54:15.360]  first-time caller been listening since the Jade Home days,
[1:54:15.360 --> 1:54:17.360]  and also wanted to let you know
[1:54:17.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  that women actually can grow beards today.
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:23.360]  But as far as your question is,
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:25.360]  to the lockdowns that are coming,
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:29.360]  I had a Bible verse Galatians 5-1.
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:31.360]  Stand fast, therefore,
[1:54:31.360 --> 1:54:34.360]  in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free,
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.360]  and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
[1:54:37.360 --> 1:54:40.360]  And I feel like that is a very clear message
[1:54:40.360 --> 1:54:43.360]  for the day that we need to come together
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:45.360]  and link arms against what they are trying to do
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:48.360]  to our society as far as the breakdowns
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:51.360]  and keeping us from everyday life.
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:53.360]  I totally agree.
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.360]  We've got to get independent as much as we can now.
[1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:58.360]  None of it's perfect.
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:00.360]  But we've got to get independent.
[1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.360]  We've got to grow crops.
[1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:04.360]  We've got to have neighbors we can trust.
[1:55:04.360 --> 1:55:06.360]  We've got to have community now.
[1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.360]  Everything the enemy is doing is about
[1:55:08.360 --> 1:55:10.360]  making us dependent on them.
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:11.360]  Yes.
[1:55:11.360 --> 1:55:13.360]  And as far as, like, my line of business,
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:16.360]  I'm a handyman, and I've seen this stuff break down.
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:19.360]  My favorite caulk, I can't even get in the store anymore.
[1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:21.360]  And it's just ridiculous.
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:23.360]  We've got to walk down everything previously,
[1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:26.360]  and, you know, we just can't stand for that kind of society.
[1:55:26.360 --> 1:55:29.360]  It's all if they use this great open society
[1:55:29.360 --> 1:55:31.360]  with these supply chains that are so strung out,
[1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:34.360]  and it seems great, but that's our weakness at the same time.
[1:55:34.360 --> 1:55:37.360]  And the globalists admit they're doing stress tests
[1:55:37.360 --> 1:55:40.360]  for bigger lockdowns and bigger viral releases in the future.
[1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:42.360]  That's really the big takeaway.
[1:55:42.360 --> 1:55:44.360]  The big ones coming, folks. Get ready.
[1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.360]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:48.360]  Alex, thank you so much.
[1:55:48.360 --> 1:55:50.360]  Big love from out here in East Texas to you, brother.
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:52.360]  We love you. Where are you at in East Texas?
[1:55:52.360 --> 1:55:53.360]  Tyler.
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:55.360]  All right. God bless you.
[1:55:55.360 --> 1:55:57.360]  Beautiful area. Got family out there.
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:59.360]  All right, I'm going to go to break,
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:02.360]  and I'm going to come back with Jennifer and Joe and Jason
[1:56:02.360 --> 1:56:08.360]  and Josh and Jefferson and Chris and HB and Robert.
[1:56:08.360 --> 1:56:12.360]  Everybody, your phone calls are bam, bam, bam, bam.
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:13.360]  And I'll do this.
[1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.360]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment,
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:17.360]  because that's how they got their sponsors to stay on air.
[1:56:17.360 --> 1:56:20.360]  Because most folks tune out of their regular ad breaks.
[1:56:20.360 --> 1:56:23.360]  We're behind. We're about to go back into the red.
[1:56:23.360 --> 1:56:25.360]  Plus, we have great products you already need.
[1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:27.360]  Go to infowarstore.com.

[1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:32.360]  hair and beard formula.

[1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:35.360]  It's not just for hair and beard.
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:37.360]  It's a powerful hair and beard formula
[1:56:37.360 --> 1:56:39.360]  that is a powerful multivitamin mineral.

[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:43.360]  Got to move it.
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:45.360]  It'll be sold out by next Monday at current sales rates.
[1:56:45.360 --> 1:56:47.360]  But I'm keeping it at that rate.
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.360]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% is humanoid.
[1:56:50.360 --> 1:56:52.360]  Leading competitors have 5%.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.360]  The other strongest brand is 75%.
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:57.360]  It's concentrated turmeric that does incredible things

[1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:52.360]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies
[1:58:52.360 --> 1:58:55.360]  in the U.S. that supplies the highest quality signature
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:58.360]  reducing Faraday cages, the Pentagon,
[1:58:58.360 --> 1:59:00.360]  and other U.S. government agencies.
[1:59:00.360 --> 1:59:03.360]  And now they have produced specifically for us
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:07.360]  this made America onion line at a very affordable price.
[1:59:07.360 --> 1:59:10.360]  Whether it's small palates that protect your cell phone
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:13.360]  or big palates that protect laptops and iPads
[1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:16.360]  or big bags that promote whatever electronics
[1:59:16.360 --> 1:59:18.360]  you want to put in it like desktop computers,

[1:59:44.360 --> 2:00:06.360]  exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:18.360]  From the front lines of the information war,
[2:00:18.360 --> 2:00:45.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:48.360]  As the 21st century began,
[2:00:48.360 --> 2:00:51.360]  human evolution was at a turning point.
[2:00:51.360 --> 2:00:53.360]  Natural selection,
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:56.360]  the process by which the strongest, the smartest,
[2:00:56.360 --> 2:01:00.360]  the fastest reproduced in greater numbers than the rest,
[2:01:00.360 --> 2:01:04.360]  a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man
[2:01:04.360 --> 2:01:07.360]  now began to favor different traits.
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:09.360]  Most science fiction of the day
[2:01:09.360 --> 2:01:12.360]  predicted a future that was more civilized
[2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:15.360]  and more intelligent, but as time went on,
[2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:18.360]  things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction,
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:20.360]  a dumbing down.
[2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:22.360]  Harvard researchers have found children
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:24.360]  who live in high-floor-eyed areas
[2:01:24.360 --> 2:01:27.360]  have significantly more IQs.
[2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:31.360]  Enjoy your extra-big-ass crime.
[2:01:31.360 --> 2:01:34.360]  Researchers found members of Congress, on average,
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:36.360]  speak at a tenth grade level.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:39.360]  Most Americans read at an eighth or ninth grade level.
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:42.360]  Look, now I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.360]  It was just a few thousand years ago
[2:01:44.360 --> 2:01:47.360]  that our ancestors were using primitive breath
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:49.360]  to communicate.
[2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  Millie's a good leader, I trust Hillary.
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:57.360]  Millie is a good leader.
[2:01:57.360 --> 2:01:59.360]  I stand here as a free slave.
[2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:00.360]  You are so dumb.
[2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:04.360]  You are really dumb, for real.
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:08.360]  Mankind became stupider at a frightening rate.
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:11.360]  You're a f***ing white man.
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:14.360]  Do you want to know what I found out?
[2:02:14.360 --> 2:02:17.360]  Most of England speaks American-ish.
[2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:20.360]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:22.360]  I've come too far.
[2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:24.360]  I believe that our education,
[2:02:24.360 --> 2:02:28.360]  like, such as South Africa and Iraq,
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.360]  everywhere, like, such as.
[2:02:30.360 --> 2:02:33.360]  And I believe that they should...
[2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:35.360]  our education over here in the U.S.
[2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:37.360]  should help the U.S.
[2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:39.360]  should help South Africa.
[2:02:39.360 --> 2:02:40.360]  What does that mean?
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:42.360]  Mercury-containing vacuum may help not harm kids
[2:02:42.360 --> 2:02:44.360]  according to two new studies
[2:02:44.360 --> 2:02:46.360]  with the journal Pediatrics.
[2:02:55.360 --> 2:02:58.360]  We now go live to violence channel correspondent
[2:02:58.360 --> 2:03:01.360]  for Micah Davis at the extreme court
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:03.360]  with highlights on today's trial.
[2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:07.360]  Good to see you in this exercise
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:09.360]  in transparency and democracy.
[2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:22.360]  Is that what it is?
[2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:28.360]  A great dust bowl had ravaged food supplies
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:31.360]  and the number one movie in the country was called...
[2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:33.360]  Ass.
[2:03:33.360 --> 2:03:36.360]  If Mr. Trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory,
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:39.360]  I think that doesn't make any sense.
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:41.360]  Of course the elections will not be rigged.
[2:03:41.360 --> 2:03:42.360]  What does that mean?
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:44.360]  Obama, you should run for a third term
[2:03:44.360 --> 2:03:45.360]  because he needs to.
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.360]  Obama, third term!
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:49.360]  How many sides does a triangle have?
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:52.360]  Damn, four.
[2:03:52.360 --> 2:03:53.360]  There's no size.
[2:03:57.360 --> 2:04:00.360]  What's Osama bin Laden most infamous for?
[2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:01.360]  Osama?
[2:04:01.360 --> 2:04:02.360]  Or Obama?
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:03.360]  Osama.
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:05.360]  I have no idea who Osama is.
[2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:08.360]  Which state does KFC come from?
[2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:10.360]  What, the chicken?
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.360]  I don't know.
[2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:14.360]  I really don't know.
[2:04:14.360 --> 2:04:16.360]  Okay, do you know what KFC stands for?
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:18.360]  Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:20.360]  A little further south from that facility,
[2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:22.360]  there's a completely separate building
[2:04:22.360 --> 2:04:24.360]  where they get this,
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:27.360]  change raw sewage water
[2:04:27.360 --> 2:04:29.360]  into water people drink.
[2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:30.360]  Wow.
[2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:31.360]  Like out the toilet?
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:33.360]  But Brando's got what plants pray.
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:35.360]  It's got electrolytes.
[2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.360]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:39.360]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:41.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:43.360]  I thought your hair would be bigger.
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:45.360]  If I wore a stock copy.
[2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:51.360]  It's a circus everybody, look!
[2:04:51.360 --> 2:04:53.360]  Yeah, look at the monkey!
[2:04:53.360 --> 2:04:54.360]  Look at the monkey!
[2:04:54.360 --> 2:04:58.360]  It was, I did that on purpose!
[2:05:24.360 --> 2:05:27.360]  And for the final 75 people to become founding members
[2:05:27.360 --> 2:05:30.360]  for this big project we're launching in the near future,
[2:05:30.360 --> 2:05:33.360]  you'll also get a personal signed piece of art
[2:05:33.360 --> 2:05:35.360]  I made of the sheepdog chasing the wolf
[2:05:35.360 --> 2:05:37.360]  and a personal message.
[2:05:37.360 --> 2:05:39.360]  It's your last chance to get all three coins

[2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:45.360]  This is history happening now.

[2:05:48.360 --> 2:05:52.360]  And this is the final 75 three coin set
[2:05:52.360 --> 2:05:57.360]  exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:06.360]  So honored, so blessed, so empowered to be here with you.
[2:06:06.360 --> 2:06:09.360]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:06:09.360 --> 2:06:11.360]  you are the Resistance.
[2:06:11.360 --> 2:06:13.360]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:16.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:18.360]  So, and welcome back.
[2:06:18.360 --> 2:06:19.360]  We're taking your phone calls.
[2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:20.360]  I'm not being rude.
[2:06:20.360 --> 2:06:23.360]  I got to hang up on you no matter how great your points are,
[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:26.360]  or we'll never get to the next person, which means you.
[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:28.360]  So let's go to Jennifer in Kentucky.
[2:06:28.360 --> 2:06:29.360]  Jennifer, thanks for calling.
[2:06:29.360 --> 2:06:31.360]  Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:35.360]  Hi, I just wanted to comment on ectopic pregnancies.
[2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:37.360]  A lot of people have been talking about that lately.
[2:06:37.360 --> 2:06:42.360]  And I just want to confirm that there is definitely not an abortion.
[2:06:42.360 --> 2:06:44.360]  And for the people that claim it is,
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:48.360]  it does a very, very big disservice to women everywhere.
[2:06:48.360 --> 2:06:52.360]  An ectopic pregnancy is a medical emergency.
[2:06:52.360 --> 2:06:54.360]  And if it isn't taken care of,
[2:06:54.360 --> 2:06:57.360]  if it isn't operated on right away, you will die.
[2:06:57.360 --> 2:07:01.360]  And you don't go to an abortion clinic for an ectopic pregnancy.
[2:07:01.360 --> 2:07:04.360]  So abortion is not healthcare.
[2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:05.360]  Well, that's right.
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:06.360]  They try to claim health of a woman.
[2:07:06.360 --> 2:07:08.360]  That's not called an abortion.
[2:07:08.360 --> 2:07:10.360]  If it's going to kill the mother and the baby,
[2:07:10.360 --> 2:07:13.360]  or the baby, if you don't, if you kill the mother, absolutely.
[2:07:13.360 --> 2:07:17.360]  And they try to mix those two issues.
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:21.360]  To the detriment of women everywhere.
[2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:25.360]  That's a good point. What should be done about that?
[2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:27.360]  Well, I think people need to realize what it is.
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:29.360]  It happened to me about 20 years ago.
[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:32.360]  And the saddest day was when I left that hospital empty-handed.
[2:07:32.360 --> 2:07:34.360]  That was not my choice.
[2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:37.360]  Of course it wasn't your choice to lose a baby.
[2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:43.360]  I mean, my wife had two miscarriages before we had my five-year-old daughter.
[2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:45.360]  She didn't kill that baby.
[2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:48.360]  That was God's choice. That's not my wife's fault.
[2:07:48.360 --> 2:07:55.360]  Right. And for them to put the two in the same bucket and then confuse people.
[2:07:55.360 --> 2:07:58.360]  I mean, can you imagine if you're a young lady?
[2:07:58.360 --> 2:08:00.360]  Oh, it's totally evil. And you're right.
[2:08:00.360 --> 2:08:01.360]  That's a great point I've been to make.
[2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:05.360]  I'm glad you read that because my wife was tough when she had two miscarriages
[2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:06.360]  and one of the baby.
[2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:08.360]  And I think God, she was tough. I wouldn't be that tough.
[2:08:08.360 --> 2:08:10.360]  Because one was a few months, one was a little bit more.
[2:08:10.360 --> 2:08:14.360]  And it was very sad when you could actually see the little baby.
[2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:18.360]  It's very horrifying and I'm not going to get into the details of it,
[2:08:18.360 --> 2:08:19.360]  but it's very serious.
[2:08:19.360 --> 2:08:20.360]  And you're right.
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:25.360]  The left acts like a baby lost in a medical emergency is abortion too.
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:27.360]  It's two different things.
[2:08:27.360 --> 2:08:29.360]  Yeah, it sure is. Thank you.
[2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:30.360]  Thank you. God bless you.
[2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:32.360]  I'm glad you raised that point because I've meant to make that point.
[2:08:32.360 --> 2:08:35.360]  They go, oh, medical emergency, we should be able to have an abortion.
[2:08:35.360 --> 2:08:39.360]  It's not an abortion if the umbilical cord is wrapped around the baby's head
[2:08:39.360 --> 2:08:40.360]  and it's dead.
[2:08:40.360 --> 2:08:42.360]  And then the mother is going to die of toxic shock.
[2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.360]  The baby is dead or the baby's already dying.
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:47.360]  The mother's going to die.
[2:08:47.360 --> 2:08:48.360]  That is not abortion.
[2:08:48.360 --> 2:08:52.360]  That is a medical procedure.
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:57.360]  I'm going to stop right there.
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:01.360]  I'm not going to say any names, but I'm going to leave it as private.
[2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:06.360]  I'm going to get into it.
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:11.360]  But yeah, when you hold in your hand and your wife comes out of the bathroom
[2:09:11.360 --> 2:09:17.360]  and they've got a baby twice the size of a gummy bear.
[2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:22.360]  And it's got a little umbilical cord attached to it.
[2:09:22.360 --> 2:09:28.360]  And you're looking at a baby, a boy or girl the size of a Lego toy, a Lego figure.
[2:09:28.360 --> 2:09:33.360]  But you can see its sweet little face, its sweet little eyes, its sweet little nose,
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:35.360]  its sweet little belly and legs.
[2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  It's just, oh my God, and not just with my current wife,
[2:09:42.360 --> 2:09:46.360]  but I've seen that three times when the woman comes out of the bathroom
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:49.360]  with that little dead baby in their hand.
[2:09:49.360 --> 2:09:51.360]  It's the next level, folks.
[2:09:51.360 --> 2:09:55.360]  And how could you ever support killing them when they're eight months old
[2:09:55.360 --> 2:10:00.360]  and are viable when you've seen them an inch tall
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:01.360]  and you see God right there.
[2:10:01.360 --> 2:10:03.360]  God made that.
[2:10:03.360 --> 2:10:05.360]  That's a human right there.
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:09.360]  Three times, which is why I'm cursed,
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:11.360]  paying for all those abortions when I didn't know about her,
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:13.360]  but I'm still repent for it.
[2:10:13.360 --> 2:10:18.360]  Three times I've held in my hands my dead children.
[2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:20.360]  That's what life's all about.
[2:10:20.360 --> 2:10:22.360]  It's hardcore. It's real.
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:25.360]  That's why taking these random calls is so powerful.
[2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:27.360]  I would never have even probably talked about that on air.
[2:10:27.360 --> 2:10:30.360]  But I know anybody that's had children, anybody that's been married,
[2:10:30.360 --> 2:10:33.360]  especially you've been married a long time and you've had a lot of kids,
[2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:39.360]  you've sat there, your wife walks out of that bathroom,
[2:10:39.360 --> 2:10:47.360]  that dead baby in her palm over him.
[2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:48.360]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[2:10:48.360 --> 2:10:49.360]  I'll go ahead and tell the story.
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:52.360]  We had a toilet baby here last week at the office.
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:54.360]  I'm not going to say who.
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:56.360]  It was at the warehouse, a nice lady.
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:59.360]  And she just thought she was having stomach pains for months.
[2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:06.360]  And she went home and had a 7-pound, 4-ounce baby.
[2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:09.360]  And the baby lived and was doing well.
[2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.360]  But you always hear those toilet baby stories.
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:14.360]  A woman goes to McDonald's bathroom and has a baby.
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:17.360]  And you're like, is that really real?
[2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:19.360]  Yeah, it's real.
[2:11:19.360 --> 2:11:22.360]  It's 100% real.
[2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:27.360]  And life's just hardcore.
[2:11:27.360 --> 2:11:29.360]  I mean, it's hardcore, man.
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:33.360]  When you're sitting there looking at a 1-inch tall baby in your hands.
[2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:36.360]  And that's your kid, man.
[2:11:36.360 --> 2:11:41.360]  Especially when you've already had children and you'd kill somebody like that for her.
[2:11:41.360 --> 2:11:45.360]  I mean, there's no doubt you attack my child, the shopping mall, whatever.
[2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:47.360]  I'm going to break your neck so fast.
[2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:49.360]  I mean, I've got whatever power it needs.
[2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:53.360]  I'm going to snap your head right off your body.
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.360]  And you think, but I just threw a bunch of my kids away saying they weren't human before that.
[2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:01.360]  And God's like, really, we'll take a look at this.
[2:12:01.360 --> 2:12:03.360]  That's all your ancestors.
[2:12:03.360 --> 2:12:04.360]  That's you.
[2:12:04.360 --> 2:12:07.360]  That's your woman combined in one creature right there.
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:17.360]  And it's dead in your hand.
[2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:25.360]  I was already so emotional, they almost did this show.
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:28.360]  But that shows you how sick the left is.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:31.360]  That's what they look like, just like that picture right there in your hand.
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:33.360]  Little sweet angel.
[2:12:33.360 --> 2:12:35.360]  Those little eyes.
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:41.360]  That little black eyes.
[2:12:41.360 --> 2:12:44.360]  The saddest part is when you put them in a little box.
[2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:47.360]  You bury them in the backyard.
[2:12:47.360 --> 2:12:51.360]  There's that little cross in the backyard.
[2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:52.360]  And then you got to move.
[2:12:52.360 --> 2:12:56.360]  You got to sell our house and you don't dig them up.
[2:12:56.360 --> 2:13:01.360]  You just leave and your child's buried in the backyard.
[2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:06.360]  But to the world, they don't have any value.
[2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:10.360]  We don't value our children.
[2:13:10.360 --> 2:13:16.360]  We don't value ourselves.
[2:13:16.360 --> 2:13:19.360]  I've sat there three times.
[2:13:19.360 --> 2:13:22.360]  That dead child right there in the palm of my hand.
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:25.360]  That's how God sees us when he sees us destroying ourselves.
[2:13:25.360 --> 2:13:27.360]  We're right there in God's palm.
[2:13:27.360 --> 2:13:30.360]  God loves us so much more than even love our children.
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:34.360]  And we chop these little babies up.
[2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:41.360]  We let them dehumanize us, burn them in furnaces, power these evil hospitals.
[2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:43.360]  I don't want to talk about anymore.
[2:13:43.360 --> 2:13:45.360]  I don't want college bringing up anymore.
[2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:46.360]  I don't want to go down this road.
[2:13:46.360 --> 2:13:47.360]  I can't do the show.
[2:13:47.360 --> 2:13:49.360]  We talk about this.
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:51.360]  But I say this.
[2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:55.360]  I thank God every minute I'm not a sociopath and I got feelings.
[2:13:55.360 --> 2:13:57.360]  Because my feelings are my strength.
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:59.360]  I intellectually make decisions.
[2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:01.360]  I spiritually make decisions, but I do have feelings.
[2:14:01.360 --> 2:14:03.360]  And I know you've got feelings.
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:07.360]  People we face, they don't have feelings except they like to hurt people.
[2:14:07.360 --> 2:14:10.360]  And we're going to beat them in the end together.
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:13.360]  I said I'd take five, six calls this segment, but I didn't.
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:16.360]  Because that lady brought that up.
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:19.360]  Think how they confuse women, what they do to them, trying to guilt them.
[2:14:19.360 --> 2:14:23.360]  Oh, a woman had lost a baby in a medical procedure.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:24.360]  That was an abortion.
[2:14:24.360 --> 2:14:26.360]  No, it wasn't.
[2:14:26.360 --> 2:14:30.360]  And we're not even judging women that spiritually didn't know what they were doing
[2:14:30.360 --> 2:14:34.360]  when they had that abortion because they were broke and the guy wasn't there
[2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:35.360]  and they didn't know what to do.
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:37.360]  People told him it was okay.
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:38.360]  God's not judging you.
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:39.360]  God understands that.
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:44.360]  But now that you're older and now that you know the truth,
[2:14:44.360 --> 2:14:47.360]  God lets you go back and fix what happened in the past
[2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:52.360]  by repenting time travel spiritually is real.
[2:14:52.360 --> 2:14:56.360]  The whole universe is connected in one space time continuum, like a big loop.
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:00.360]  And you can go back and say you were sorry for things you did,
[2:15:00.360 --> 2:15:03.360]  but you've got to be really sorry.
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:08.360]  And you got to promise to do whatever it takes to not do it again.
[2:15:08.360 --> 2:15:10.360]  And that's real power.
[2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:14.360]  The power to be forgiven for what we've done in the past.
[2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:17.360]  But I will warn you.
[2:15:17.360 --> 2:15:23.360]  God's got a way of doing things where you're not just going to repent
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:26.360]  and then sit on your ass.
[2:15:26.360 --> 2:15:27.360]  You're going to have to fight.
[2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:31.360]  And God's going to show you what you did once you're awake
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:39.360]  so that it burns into you real good so you understand what the big picture is.
[2:15:39.360 --> 2:15:43.360]  I'd kill anybody for my children just like that.
[2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:49.360]  But in a previous incarnation, I flushed them like they were nothing.
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  Think about that.
[2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:55.360]  We'll be right back with your phone calls info wars.com.
[2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:35.360]  We sold out of this for almost a year,
[2:16:35.360 --> 2:16:39.360]  but we made a major purchase and it is now in stock
[2:16:39.360 --> 2:16:42.360]  for whatever your need is at info wars.com.
[2:16:42.360 --> 2:16:46.360]  You'll also find instructional videos and more information at info wars.com
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:52.360]  or vbiopros.com made America powered by God's great creation.
[2:16:52.360 --> 2:16:57.360]  It is amazing and it funds the info war.
[2:16:57.360 --> 2:17:02.360]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:05.360]  and with poisons and chemicals added to the food.
[2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:07.360]  It's all come out.
[2:17:07.360 --> 2:17:09.360]  And they're doing that not because we're weak,
[2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:11.360]  but because we're made the image of God, the creator.
[2:17:11.360 --> 2:17:13.360]  And we are powerful.
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:16.360]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[2:17:16.360 --> 2:17:19.360]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:23.360]  that nobody knows who first came up with the boy, is it true?
[2:17:23.360 --> 2:17:30.360]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[2:17:30.360 --> 2:17:32.360]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:35.360]  and all their evil and all their cultural death
[2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:39.360]  because they know we are strong.
[2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:43.360]  And they know in the end they signed on to God of this world who is a loser.
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:47.360]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep info wars in the air now more than ever.
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:49.360]  Because even if you don't believe in God,
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:53.360]  what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is safe channel.
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:57.360]  And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[2:17:57.360 --> 2:17:59.360]  The National Dissues is a new film.
[2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:02.360]  2000 mules is the most important documentary in modern times
[2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:06.360]  because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election
[2:18:06.360 --> 2:18:09.360]  and how they are planning to steal future elections and complete our journey
[2:18:09.360 --> 2:18:11.360]  to basically being like Venezuela.
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:14.360]  Now it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch online.

[2:19:00.360 --> 2:19:03.360]  and that's because it's been denatured, it's been marked down.
[2:19:03.360 --> 2:19:05.360]  We didn't do that.
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:10.360]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that this is the very best I can get?
[2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:12.360]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[2:19:12.360 --> 2:19:17.360]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product
[2:19:17.360 --> 2:19:21.360]  because I want that good will.
[2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:24.360]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[2:19:24.360 --> 2:19:27.360]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:29.360]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:39.360]  And this little jewel right here is solid liquid consciousness.

[2:19:47.360 --> 2:19:52.360]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil

[2:20:45.360 --> 2:20:49.360]  Thank you Heavenly Father for giving us consciousness and giving us a soul.
[2:20:49.360 --> 2:20:53.360]  Thank you for giving us will and the sermon of no life wrong.
[2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:59.360]  Thank you.
[2:20:59.360 --> 2:21:06.360]  Alright, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[2:21:06.360 --> 2:21:09.360]  Joe in Florida, you're on the air, welcome sir.
[2:21:09.360 --> 2:21:11.360]  Hello, Alex, how are you?
[2:21:11.360 --> 2:21:13.360]  I'm alright brother.
[2:21:13.360 --> 2:21:16.360]  Yeah, I just saw that powerful speech brother, powerful speech.
[2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:20.360]  You really transformed what I was going to talk to you about.
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.360]  I have a little girl and you know what?
[2:21:24.360 --> 2:21:28.360]  I look at my little girl every day and I'm just thankful to the Lord of what I have.
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:29.360]  Absolutely beautiful.
[2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:30.360]  Absolutely.
[2:21:30.360 --> 2:21:32.360]  And you know what?
[2:21:32.360 --> 2:21:36.360]  I'm going to tell you Alex, God always never gives up on anybody.
[2:21:36.360 --> 2:21:41.360]  So let's just pray for those who are just not in the spirit of the Lord.
[2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:43.360]  And they don't know what they're missing.
[2:21:43.360 --> 2:21:46.360]  They have no idea what they're missing and they just do the Holy Spirit.
[2:21:46.360 --> 2:21:50.360]  I wish our enemies could experience it.
[2:21:50.360 --> 2:21:56.360]  Yeah, no, it's and honestly, we were traveling, we never wanted to have children
[2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:00.360]  and by the grace of God, my little girl is the most,
[2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:04.360]  I mean every parent will say that they're the most beautiful thing, a person thing.
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:05.360]  I shouldn't say that.
[2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:07.360]  The most beautiful person I've ever met in my life.
[2:22:07.360 --> 2:22:09.360]  How old is your little sweetheart?
[2:22:09.360 --> 2:22:10.360]  Four years old Alex.
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:12.360]  Wow.
[2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:17.360]  She's a beautiful little girl and I can't even tell you how thankful I am to the Lord
[2:22:17.360 --> 2:22:20.360]  and his son Jesus Christ and that she was healthy.
[2:22:20.360 --> 2:22:29.360]  But I saw your speed before the commercial break and I'm like, wow, powerful stuff Alex.
[2:22:29.360 --> 2:22:30.360]  Well, it's real.
[2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:36.360]  I share that stuff because it's about being real and you see your children born
[2:22:36.360 --> 2:22:37.360]  and they're wonderful.
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:38.360]  You couldn't imagine killing them.
[2:22:38.360 --> 2:22:43.360]  But for women that go through miscarriages, it's what women go through.
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:45.360]  Women are so amazing.
[2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:47.360]  Yeah, I had this thought.
[2:22:47.360 --> 2:22:49.360]  I was going to plug one of your products.
[2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:54.360]  It sounds kind of backwards thinking here because you just, but you know,
[2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:57.360]  all those out there are looking for quality products.
[2:22:57.360 --> 2:23:02.360]  I order a lot of your t-shirts and they're eye-openers, they're conversation getters
[2:23:02.360 --> 2:23:05.360]  and I think for those of us who are watching your show, you know,
[2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.360]  get online, get to theinfowarsstore.com and buy some products because...
[2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:11.360]  Well, sign up, brother.
[2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:12.360]  They're trying to shut us down.
[2:23:12.360 --> 2:23:13.360]  I know God's going to provide.
[2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:14.360]  Thank you.
[2:23:14.360 --> 2:23:15.360]  Thank you.
[2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:16.360]  I appreciate it.
[2:23:16.360 --> 2:23:17.360]  God bless you, man.
[2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:21.360]  If you were conscious, this would be easy.
[2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:25.360]  But every one of those babies that didn't make it had a soul and in a way
[2:23:25.360 --> 2:23:28.360]  it's transcended and made it through even having to go through what you have to go through.
[2:23:28.360 --> 2:23:32.360]  So it's all in God's plan.
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:38.360]  In fact, those are probably the best souls.
[2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:44.360]  And God doesn't want them to be killed, but God greedily keeps them for himself.
[2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:47.360]  And the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[2:23:47.360 --> 2:23:50.360]  Jason in Texas, go ahead.
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:52.360]  Yeah, Alex.
[2:23:52.360 --> 2:23:55.360]  Just real quick, I'll run it down.
[2:23:55.360 --> 2:24:02.360]  Just like we talked two years ago with what's his name in California.
[2:24:02.360 --> 2:24:08.360]  Eric Solwell had the tweet about, you know, Nuke and in bombing our own cities and states.
[2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:10.360]  That will be true here soon.
[2:24:10.360 --> 2:24:15.360]  Let's remind him, he said, we'll nuke gun owners to get your guns.
[2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:18.360]  I mean, what an incredibly evil statement.
[2:24:18.360 --> 2:24:19.360]  Exactly.
[2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:21.360]  And you know what they say, they'll actually do.
[2:24:21.360 --> 2:24:24.360]  They follow through on those kind of things.
[2:24:24.360 --> 2:24:30.360]  Another thing, we have to act like these Dutch farmers, you know, we can't go back into
[2:24:30.360 --> 2:24:31.360]  lockdown.
[2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:32.360]  We're not doing none of this.
[2:24:32.360 --> 2:24:36.360]  I never did in the first place, but, you know, if you guys all hide in tower, you know,
[2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:39.360]  they're just going to run right over us, you know, there's millions of us.
[2:24:39.360 --> 2:24:45.360]  And there's what, a handful of these, you know, evil criminals that try to run our
[2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:46.360]  world in life.
[2:24:46.360 --> 2:24:47.360]  I don't think so.
[2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:50.360]  They're getting their big global collapse ready.
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:53.360]  They want to use another virus as a pretext to lock us down.
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:55.360]  We must not comply with it.
[2:24:55.360 --> 2:24:58.360]  And the new attack is imminent.
[2:24:58.360 --> 2:24:59.360]  Absolutely.
[2:24:59.360 --> 2:25:04.360]  And then real quick, I said, Beto Rourke, he will be the governor of Texas through fraud.
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:05.360]  Now mark my words.
[2:25:05.360 --> 2:25:06.360]  I hope not.
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:08.360]  I pray to God not.
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:15.360]  And then if he saw down in Nevada, that man that filmed himself harassing Steve Stisselack,
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:17.360]  he ended, he's dead now.
[2:25:17.360 --> 2:25:20.360]  He committed suicide.
[2:25:20.360 --> 2:25:21.360]  Unbelievable.
[2:25:21.360 --> 2:25:22.360]  Thank you, sir.
[2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:24.360]  Let's talk to Chris in Georgia.
[2:25:24.360 --> 2:25:25.360]  Chris, welcome.
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:26.360]  Hey, buddy.
[2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:29.360]  I, by the way, I love that song you just played.
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:31.360]  Who was that, by the way?
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:32.360]  Laina Del Rain.
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:34.360]  Oh, that's terrific.
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:41.360]  Yeah, you know, on the issue of global population and the reduction of it, well, even the World
[2:25:41.360 --> 2:25:48.360]  Health Organization and the UN, they all agree that most of the cultures of this world are
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:51.360]  as the white elites call them, people of color.
[2:25:51.360 --> 2:25:58.360]  So how is it not genocidal racism to talk about reducing population?
[2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:01.360]  It is pure genocide.
[2:26:01.360 --> 2:26:04.360]  Absolutely in the Stalinist mold.
[2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:08.360]  And nobody's noticing this except, of course, the great people who listen to this.
[2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:14.360]  Well, that's because the average leftist is a racist, greedy, hateful pig.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  But most of them actually aren't even part of the power structure.
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:19.360]  They pretend they're part of it.
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:20.360]  They're pretenders.
[2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:21.360]  Does that make sense?
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:24.360]  Like, it's bad enough to be Bill Gates or Prince Charles.
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.360]  But 99% of their minions are being destroyed by their very system.
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:30.360]  But they have the spirit, so they go along with it.
[2:26:30.360 --> 2:26:35.360]  It is truly the useful idiots that the Russians talked about.
[2:26:35.360 --> 2:26:39.360]  And it's on the move right now.
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:40.360]  It is, brother.
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:41.360]  Anything else, Chris?
[2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:42.360]  That's it.
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:43.360]  Thanks, brother.
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:44.360]  Thank you, my friend.
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:46.360]  I really appreciate you calling and holding.
[2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:48.360]  Josh in FEMA Region 8, you're on the air.
[2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  Go ahead.
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:52.360]  Hey, my barbecue and brother.
[2:26:52.360 --> 2:26:56.360]  I just wanted to say that we need to take the steps in our own hands.
[2:26:56.360 --> 2:27:00.360]  We need to get out there, start pushing dutchuprising.com.
[2:27:00.360 --> 2:27:04.360]  We need to start saying that Biden's just a puppet.
[2:27:04.360 --> 2:27:07.360]  Bring up the names like Klaus Schwab, George Soros.
[2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:08.360]  I agree.
[2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:09.360]  The Dutch are the way.
[2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:11.360]  Don't wait till they shut your energy off.
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:13.360]  Take peaceful civil disobedient action now.
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:16.360]  I think the Dutch model is the way to go.
[2:27:16.360 --> 2:27:20.360]  And I also believe that in the COVID land out there showing people,
[2:27:20.360 --> 2:27:22.360]  I've been handed out to people.
[2:27:22.360 --> 2:27:26.360]  I was wondering, is that a zero country code?
[2:27:26.360 --> 2:27:27.360]  Not sure.
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.360]  I didn't make the film, but it probably is.
[2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:31.360]  Okay.
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:32.360]  I was just wondering about that.
[2:27:32.360 --> 2:27:34.360]  Try to get more copies, get it out and everything.
[2:27:34.360 --> 2:27:37.360]  And I just think that we just need to start pushing it and showing people
[2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:39.360]  their agenda through the dutchuprising.
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:42.360]  And then showing them that it's not really Biden in charge.
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.360]  It's a global elite coming at us.
[2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:47.360]  Beautifully said, Josh.
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:48.360]  Thank you.
[2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:49.360]  All right.
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:51.360]  Matt Bracken hadn't been on the show in over a year.
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:55.360]  And he was a little upset by what I said yesterday about him.
[2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:57.360]  So he scheduled to come on.
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:27:59.360]  All I said was is that I didn't agree with going to the Capitol.
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:01.360]  He said we may need to go on the Capitol.
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:02.360]  He said it on my show.
[2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:03.360]  He was guest hosting.
[2:28:03.360 --> 2:28:06.360]  So it became this big fiasco with the January 6th committee and subpoenas
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:08.360]  asking me what Matt Bracken meant by that.
[2:28:08.360 --> 2:28:10.360]  So we'll find out what Matt means today.
[2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:12.360]  The left store was capitals all the time.
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:13.360]  And it's, you know, wonderful and a good thing.
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:15.360]  But, but I didn't think it was a good idea that day.
[2:28:15.360 --> 2:28:16.360]  And I wasn't involved in it.
[2:28:16.360 --> 2:28:18.360]  Well, they're trying to frame me for it right now.
[2:28:18.360 --> 2:28:22.360]  So January 6th becomes this thing that sucks all the oxygen out of the room.
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:25.360]  As they try to brand the American opposition to tyranny as terrorists.
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:29.360]  But I think Matt's, you know, a great author and been a popular host here on the show.
[2:28:29.360 --> 2:28:30.360]  Hadn't been on a while.
[2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:33.360]  And he said, hey, we really haven't reached out very much to him.
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.360]  Well, we did some, but regardless, he's coming up right now on the other side.
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.360]  Infowars.com.
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:41.360]  Tomorrow's news today.

[2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:50.360]  And I'm going to get to Tyler and Fabio and Jefferson and HB and Robert before this broadcast

[2:30:52.360 --> 2:30:56.360]  One of the most important things you can do is get ahead of inflation now because the
[2:30:56.360 --> 2:30:57.360]  inflation is just beginning.
[2:30:57.360 --> 2:31:03.360]  Several years ago, I approached one of the top companies in the U.S. that supplies the
[2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:08.360]  highest quality signature reducing Faraday Cages, the Pentagon and other U.S. government
[2:31:08.360 --> 2:31:09.360]  agencies.

[2:32:42.360 --> 2:32:47.360]  For a guy in his 60's pushing 70, I'm not just blowing smoke here.
[2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:49.360]  here, the B-12 saves my life.
[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:02.680]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:33:02.680 --> 2:33:03.960]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:03.960 --> 2:33:20.600]  All right, a bunch of Prime Ministers have designed in the world. In Italy, in
[2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:24.320]  Aries, Eastern Europe, you name it, it's a big deal that's coming up so the next
[2:33:24.320 --> 2:33:28.040]  hour also take your phone calls, people that are holding. But Matt Braggen's been
[2:33:28.040 --> 2:33:32.600]  a long-term guest on the show, best-selling author, former Navy Seal, and he sent me an
[2:33:32.600 --> 2:33:37.040]  email yesterday, taking what I said as attacking him, and that's not what was
[2:33:37.040 --> 2:33:40.960]  meant by it. We tried to get him on last year, he was busy with family stuff, didn't
[2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:45.480]  come on. I was subpoenaed by the January 6th Committee saying, what did Matt
[2:33:45.480 --> 2:33:49.600]  Braggen mean by this clip we're about to play here in just a moment, this played
[2:33:49.600 --> 2:33:53.360]  two days ago, the January 6th Committee, with Matt saying, maybe you need to store
[2:33:53.360 --> 2:33:57.160]  on the Capitol. And then they're telling me that I told Matt Braggen to do that,
[2:33:57.160 --> 2:34:01.880]  so my issue is, I don't think that was a good idea, and that's my point. But Matt's
[2:34:01.880 --> 2:34:04.600]  here to respond to it, we appreciate him doing that, I don't think Matt Braggen's
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:08.800]  a bad person, he's a good person, I don't think he is a Ray Apps, and he's gonna be
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:12.080]  able to respond to this here in just a moment. But first, let's go ahead and play
[2:34:12.080 --> 2:34:16.720]  this clip from the January 6th hearings. Meanwhile, other key Trump supporters,
[2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:22.040]  including far-right media personalities, began promoting the wild protest on
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:29.880]  January 6th. It's Saturday, December 19th, the year of 2020, and one of the most
[2:34:29.880 --> 2:34:36.280]  historic events in American history has just taken place. President Trump, in the
[2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:42.440]  early morning hours today, tweeted that he wants the American people to march on
[2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:50.240]  Washington DC on January 6th, 2021. And now Donald Trump is calling on his
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:58.280]  supporters to descend on Washington DC, January 6th. He is now calling on we, the
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:35:03.400]  people, to take action and to show our numbers. We're going to only be saved by
[2:35:03.400 --> 2:35:11.120]  millions of Americans moving to Washington, occupying the entire area, if
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:16.720]  necessary, storming right into the Capitol. You know, there, we know the
[2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:22.640]  rules of engagement. If you have enough people, you can push down any kind of
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:28.000]  offense or a wall. This could be Trump's last stand, and it's a time when he has
[2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:33.200]  specifically called on his supporters to arrive in DC. That's something that may
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:37.440]  actually be the big push. So the Democrats burned down millions of dollars. They
[2:35:37.440 --> 2:35:42.200]  killed hundreds of people. They invaded all these capitals. I understand being
[2:35:42.200 --> 2:35:46.840]  angry and saying, say no election fraud, but they're using this to claim there's
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.080]  some brain conspiracy here, and it's out of context with Matt Bracken said. That's
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:54.960]  a fair point. He may look back and watch full tape. And so Matt Bracken joins us
[2:35:54.960 --> 2:35:59.720]  right now. Matt, good to have you back on the info war, buddy. Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[2:35:59.720 --> 2:36:05.080]  I hope that people will go back and watch that full show. That's easy to find. It's
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:11.360]  the last show of 2020, December 31. And I had the last hour, so it's easy to find.
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:18.320]  It's, it's just called, we'll see you in the year 2021, Alex Jones final
[2:36:18.320 --> 2:36:24.520]  broadcast of 2020. Anyway, that clip that they played, I think it's like 22
[2:36:24.520 --> 2:36:28.840]  seconds, something like that. Is at the end of almost an hour, there's maybe two
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:33.440]  or three minutes after that, where I'd gone through, you know, a lot of the
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:38.520]  election fraud proof that I still think is standing proof. And that if we don't
[2:36:38.520 --> 2:36:43.000]  do something about it, there's not going to be a meaningful next election. Just
[2:36:43.000 --> 2:36:47.880]  like in Venezuela, you know, they after the first Hugo Chavez election,
[2:36:47.880 --> 2:36:51.040]  conservatives down there thought, well, you know, we'll get them next time.
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:55.360]  There's not a next time once they can rig an election. I mean, you're just,
[2:36:55.360 --> 2:37:00.720]  you're just going to get rolled over more easily each time. And to me, what the
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:07.720]  whole J6 thing is about is criminalizing, questioning election fraud that, you know,
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:12.360]  they can cement the election fraud if they can intimidate people away from,
[2:37:12.360 --> 2:37:16.880]  you know, even looking into it. As far as I'm concerned, there has been no
[2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:23.520]  meaningful investigation. Anyway, that's, I said what I said, but I also had said
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:28.240]  in that hour, that final hour, you know, there were things we could do if they
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:33.040]  don't let us, if there's no redress of grievance, we can arrange giant car
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:38.520]  caravans, the Circle Washington DC. I mean, I talked about a lot of things.
[2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.640]  Sure, you're saying you covered every scenario. You're saying they took it out of
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:45.960]  context. Well, I mean, I believe it. And that statement, the one that they clip
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:52.560]  that they played, if, you know, it says, if necessary, storming into the capital,
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:58.880]  that's in the context of if there is no redress, if it's just, you know, double
[2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:04.120]  barreled middle fingers, you're not, you know, we cheat, screw you, go home, you
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:08.720]  know, sign up for social credit. So finish comments on that. I agree. And if I
[2:38:08.720 --> 2:38:12.480]  sounded half cocked, I apologize. I don't think you're a fed. I'm glad to have you
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.560]  back on the show here. I want to get your takers. You're a smart guy. What do you
[2:38:16.560 --> 2:38:20.520]  think's coming next with 170 days after the election and like the state of
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:24.720]  America? I mean, my God, do we not predict? Did you not predict this all?
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:31.080]  I'm really worried about the Russia Ukraine thing. I mean, that PSA about,
[2:38:31.080 --> 2:38:34.840]  you know, what to do in a nuclear war, you know, watch the radiation.
[2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:39.480]  Yeah, they might do a nuclear false flag to blame Russia or or they're just
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:44.080]  going to escalate it. You know, they give the high Mars to Ukraine. Hi, they
[2:38:44.080 --> 2:38:47.800]  push them up close to Russia, fire into Russia. The next thing it's going to
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:53.760]  happen is America or the Russians will take down the ISR platforms over our
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:38:58.600]  American ISR platforms that are over Ukraine, Poland, Romania and the Black
[2:38:58.600 --> 2:39:05.640]  Sea that when when they target ISR platforms are explained to them, the
[2:39:05.640 --> 2:39:09.520]  escalation of things. Well, it's basically reconnaissance and
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:13.360]  intelligence surveillance reconnaissance. These big global hawks are like three
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:17.800]  times as big as a predator. When the high Mars, which it's rumored that there's
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:22.520]  actually American crews, whether they're active duty military or wink, wink
[2:39:22.520 --> 2:39:28.000]  contractors, when they punch in the GPS coordinate on the high Mar missile, that
[2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:33.600]  GPS coordinate was gained from an American ISR platform hovering, you know,
[2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:38.440]  high over the Black Sea able to look way down into Ukraine. So Americans are the
[2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:43.920]  ones that are giving the GPS coordinates that kill the kill Russians. You can
[2:39:43.920 --> 2:39:48.080]  say I don't have a problem with that, you know, that they're including like targeted
[2:39:48.080 --> 2:39:53.040]  assassinations. You could call it of Russian generals because our ISR figures
[2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:57.280]  out from their communications, etc. Where there are some Russian generals
[2:39:57.280 --> 2:40:02.800]  meeting and boom, you know, a Ukrainian supposedly, then sure, it's like Obama
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:06.360]  bragging, I'm really good at killing people with drones. Yeah, and this is
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:10.680]  going to have consequences. So I think that we could easily see an ex and an
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:16.840]  escalation that's going to lead to the Russians taking out unmanned platforms,
[2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:22.360]  you know, initially, and you know, in order to try to blind us and including
[2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:26.960]  satellites in space. Well, they said that they said we're gonna take out the
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:32.360]  NATO forces that the heavy weapons, the high tech weapons in Ukraine. But at the
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:36.800]  top at the pinnacle of this whole pyramid, our entire financial house of
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:43.640]  cards is about to, you know, implode burn down. And one of the proven ways for the,
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:50.120]  you know, for the the guilty bankers that have profited from this all along is to
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:53.880]  just you burn the books, you know, there's if there's no more Wall Street,
[2:40:53.880 --> 2:40:57.120]  you're not going to have a trial over, you know, why did the Great Depression
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:02.480]  happen? Why did the American dollar collapse to zero? You know, it'll just be that
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:07.040]  was those Russians. You know, they blame them for the gas prices. They blame them
[2:41:07.040 --> 2:41:11.480]  for the open borders. I mean, I agree. So I look, I believe you. And if it sounded
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:14.840]  like I was saying we're a bad person, man, I apologize. I believe you're just
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:18.400]  covering all the different angles of what could happen on January 6 and they
[2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:22.760]  took it into context. I believe you show if it came off wrong, I apologize. That's
[2:41:22.760 --> 2:41:27.080]  why email never said anything on any platform, you know, and in any way
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:31.040]  against you. I want to mention in a time that I have, are we doing another break
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:35.360]  or? Yeah, no, you'll have another, you'll have as long as you need. Okay, that there's
[2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:40.960]  there's still J6 people languishing in solitary confinement in the United
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:46.520]  States of America. You know, there's there's a retired master sergeant Jeremy
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:51.800]  Brown. He's been on this show, I think he served 20 years multiple tours in
[2:41:51.800 --> 2:41:57.680]  Afghanistan and Iraq. He was recruited, attempted to be recruited by the FBI.
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:42:01.640]  He's the green beret that never went in the capital but exposed them. So he's
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:07.840]  still in jail. Well, and he's in jail because in March, he released footage
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:12.880]  where he had kind of burned the FBI when they tried to recruit him to be a
[2:42:12.880 --> 2:42:18.160]  stasi for the FBI, you know, to secretly record other retired green berets and
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:23.320]  other friends of his to set them up. He refused, but he not only refused, he
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:26.560]  recorded the pitch. Well, that's just like what happened with Randy Weaver guy
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:29.640]  blessed him down a month ago. Stay there, Matt. It's great to have you back. You
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:34.840]  can come host an hour here. Just do it. Do a disclaimer if you're playing all
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:38.640]  the angles and I give they could take out a context. But I mean, literally, they're
[2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:41.920]  trying to indict me now. I'm claiming you and I were in some command base and I
[2:42:41.920 --> 2:42:45.000]  ordered you to say that on air. We know you. It's out of context. We'll talk
[2:42:45.000 --> 2:42:48.200]  about it with Matt Bracken right ahead. Matt Bracken enemies foreign domestic

[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.200]  or rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire. Fortune and Money magazine
[2:45:06.200 --> 2:45:10.160]  have all done these profiles. You see it every year. 30 different tax returns,
[2:45:10.160 --> 2:45:14.120]  30 different answers, 50 different tax returns, 50 different answers. And
[2:45:14.120 --> 2:45:18.720]  almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big
[2:45:18.720 --> 2:45:21.960]  tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general
[2:45:21.960 --> 2:45:26.320]  public understanding this and knowing this. So it's a very important situation
[2:45:26.320 --> 2:45:31.840]  with inflation, all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do

[2:45:38.960 --> 2:45:45.920]  last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com,
[2:45:45.920 --> 2:45:54.480]  one word, jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-904-285-833-904-285.
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:46:03.600]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:09.240]  that's what people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not
[2:46:09.240 --> 2:46:12.480]  going to find a better place for information. You might not agree with
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.960]  everything. You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the
[2:46:15.960 --> 2:46:19.880]  information. And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here. Thank
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:25.160]  you for that Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:28.480]  is where to get them, folks. And we do have the best supplements. I mean, just
[2:46:28.480 --> 2:46:33.880]  like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the
[2:46:33.880 --> 2:46:38.200]  best with our supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support
[2:46:38.200 --> 2:46:42.440]  formula. Folks, this is a joke. I mean, we're giving this thing away. It's 75
[2:46:42.440 --> 2:46:46.440]  percent off. By the way, it works for me. In case you haven't noticed, the hair and
[2:46:46.440 --> 2:46:53.400]  beard formula is working for me. Quite well, I might add. Quite well. My barber
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:58.080]  appreciates hair and beard support for Ben. I go and see him quite often now.
[2:46:58.080 --> 2:47:17.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:32.320]  West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River. Life is older, older than the trees,
[2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:44.120]  younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze. Country roads, taking home to the
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:54.120]  place I belong. West Virginia. West Virginia, Mountain Mama.
[2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:57.320]  All right, Matt Dragon, we really appreciate you. You're welcome back anytime you'd like
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:48:02.240]  for a full hour. But just big picture, moving past. I get it. You were covering
[2:48:02.240 --> 2:48:06.080]  all the scenarios, all the war games. Now you're back here on the show, and I believe
[2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:11.520]  you're a great guy. We inferred anything, I apologize. But separately, big picture
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:17.440]  about where the world is, and the economy, and China, and new lockdowns coming. Wow,
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:22.320]  are not the patriots of vindicated with all of our predictions?
[2:48:22.320 --> 2:48:26.600]  I would say totally vindicated. And, you know, I try not to be too black-pilled about the
[2:48:26.600 --> 2:48:34.040]  coming elections. You know, maybe there'll be such a conservative title wave that it'll
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:38.600]  defeat every kind of cheating. I hope so. But I don't know what good it's going to
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:47.080]  do if Biden is still nominally in charge of the executive branch. So what if the Republicans
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:52.400]  can have meaningless committee chairmanship and hold some meaningless hearings? The borders
[2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:57.720]  still wide open. You know, the criminals, the fentanyl, still flooding in. We're still
[2:48:57.720 --> 2:49:04.080]  sabotaging the military. That's total sabotage what they're doing. You know, between the
[2:49:04.080 --> 2:49:11.760]  sexual confusion they're forcing at every level, and the mandatory mRNA injections,
[2:49:11.760 --> 2:49:17.480]  which are driving out more than a tenth of the military, is going to be booted out.
[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:23.720]  And it's the tenth that are the conservatives that said no to the jab, leaving us stripped
[2:49:23.720 --> 2:49:28.720]  of our best warriors. So this is an intentional thing going on. And at the same time, poking
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:35.400]  the bear, trying to instigate some kind of a, you know, a missile crisis that can result
[2:49:35.400 --> 2:49:42.320]  in whether it's a false flag or not, it really doesn't matter if you keep prodding and poking
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:43.320]  a hornet's nest.
[2:49:43.320 --> 2:49:48.360]  I agree. Say, hey, what are your predictions with Ukraine? Because Putin's clearly winning
[2:49:48.360 --> 2:49:53.280]  the war to take over eastern Ukraine. The globalists, Ukraine's kind of moved out of
[2:49:53.280 --> 2:49:59.960]  the news, but the weapons, now the IMF and World Bank wants $600 plus billion. I mean,
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:03.280]  it's just an unbelievable acceleration.
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:09.200]  We're already running out of money to pay for this, even our funny money. They're sawing
[2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:15.000]  off the branch that they're sitting on because they still require the Russian gas. Europe's
[2:50:15.000 --> 2:50:18.000]  going to freeze in the winter. Europe's going to go into a great depression.
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:22.360]  And by the way, why did they think of that? Because Russian grains at all-time highs,
[2:50:22.360 --> 2:50:26.240]  Russian fuel, Russia's actually doing well other than a bunch of dead Russian troops,
[2:50:26.240 --> 2:50:31.320]  which is their big sacrifice. It's massive. It makes me think like Putin's running this
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:34.680]  or something. This is only making him stronger.
[2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:40.640]  This is not, these are not massive casualties compared to other conflicts that Russia has
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:41.640]  been involved in.
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:44.200]  Yeah, 20 million dead in World War II.
[2:50:44.200 --> 2:50:48.680]  At least 20 million. And that's very fresh and current because this is actually taught
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:55.880]  in, you know, patriotism is like a main subject in Russian education. It's not, you know,
[2:50:55.880 --> 2:50:59.880]  like America is tear down the statues, crap on our history.
[2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:05.800]  No, let's be clear. The Russians lost 30% of their people in World War II. The real war.
[2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:09.160]  Americans were involved, obviously, but it was chicken feet compared to the Russians,
[2:51:09.160 --> 2:51:14.720]  the Germans, toe-to-toe. 24 million dead Germans, 27 million dead Russians. This was the real
[2:51:14.720 --> 2:51:16.520]  war.
[2:51:16.520 --> 2:51:21.480]  Russians went over there to fight. And on the home front, the war just made me some rationing.
[2:51:21.480 --> 2:51:28.000]  You couldn't get new tires. You couldn't get much gas for your car. But Russians, the Russian
[2:51:28.000 --> 2:51:33.920]  comprehension of World War II would be something as if, you know, the Nazis had been a vast
[2:51:33.920 --> 2:51:39.760]  superior army, had landed in New York and just laid waste all the way to, say, Ohio.
[2:51:39.760 --> 2:51:47.920]  You know, had seized Washington for 700 days, leading to cannibalism, mass starvation, and
[2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:50.800]  just scorched earth, going all the way to Stalin's death.
[2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:53.720]  So the genetic memory of the Russians is total war.
[2:51:53.720 --> 2:52:00.280]  Totally different. And that they have been invaded from the Mongols, then from the Swedes,
[2:52:00.280 --> 2:52:06.760]  the Germans, you know, finally the, you know, Napoleon, every century, every other century,
[2:52:06.760 --> 2:52:12.480]  all have come from the east, the north, and the west to try to conquer Russia. And they,
[2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:17.000]  and it's not an easy place to defend because there's no mountain barrier.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:23.800]  So their memory is when an enemy is gearing up to put an alliance in Ukraine. I mean,
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:30.080]  they told us for 20 years, Ukraine is the final red line. In 1990, James Baker told
[2:52:30.080 --> 2:52:36.640]  Gorbachev, we will not, you know, in return for the reunification of Germany and the Soviets
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:40.720]  leaving Eastern Europe, NATO would not push eastward.
[2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:47.000]  So to them, to the Russians, we're, that's like the Sue listening to, you know, the great
[2:52:47.000 --> 2:52:51.200]  white father, when they sign a treaty, you know, for, you know,
[2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:56.160]  Exactly. And we know that half of Putin's family died in World War II. So they're fully
[2:52:56.160 --> 2:53:00.880]  committed is what you're saying. And when, and it's a predictable thing
[2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:06.280]  that they told us for 20 years, look, we are pissed that you're putting missiles in Poland
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.600]  and Romania. They, we call them anti ballistic missiles, but it's really a joke because it
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:16.600]  just depends on that, you know, the trajectory and what you put on the front of the missile.
[2:53:16.600 --> 2:53:22.600]  So you, when they, when we were talking even last December, January, February about Ukraine
[2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:26.320]  still joining NATO for Russia, that was all bets are off.
[2:53:26.320 --> 2:53:29.560]  So what are you predicting? What are you, you're a smart guy. What are you predicting
[2:53:29.560 --> 2:53:31.960]  is going to happen?
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:36.960]  I think that cooler, they're, they're setting up a situation where we're basically bowling
[2:53:36.960 --> 2:53:43.640]  and juggling, uh, flaming chainsaws in a nitroglycerin factory. And that's by design because the
[2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:49.360]  economic house of cards is going to collapse anyway. If it collapses with, with missiles
[2:53:49.360 --> 2:53:56.000]  across Europe and, and, uh, uh, a world war, then the banks get to just say, Hey, it was,
[2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:01.480]  it was out of anybody's control. Nobody, we did the best we could. If the, if the economy
[2:54:01.480 --> 2:54:07.120]  collapses, the dollar goes to zero. There's mass starvation in cities without a war. Then
[2:54:07.120 --> 2:54:13.080]  it's going to be pitchforks, you know, and torches up to Wall Street and Washington.
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:18.480]  So a war cleans all those dirty books out of war, erases the history. And they, we just
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:23.700]  get to say it was those Russians that did it. That's what, so I, that's why we keep
[2:54:23.700 --> 2:54:27.400]  prodding the bear. It's a way to just erase the bad books.
[2:54:27.400 --> 2:54:35.480]  You're totally right. I mean, Putin is, is the scapegoat, whether he's good or bad, he's
[2:54:35.480 --> 2:54:41.400]  the scapegoat for everything. And they tell us gas prices. All of it is the Russians when
[2:54:41.400 --> 2:54:45.240]  we know it's not. And then separately though, Biden says, Oh, it's really part of a great
[2:54:45.240 --> 2:54:50.040]  transition to build back better. Why do you think they say at a one side of their mouth,
[2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:54.000]  yeah, we're doing on purpose, the other side of their mouth, it's Putin's fault.
[2:54:54.000 --> 2:54:59.480]  Well, I think that the, that the scheme of the world economic forum has been, is being
[2:54:59.480 --> 2:55:05.040]  very successfully exposed, you know, that what's happening in Sri Lanka, that was all
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:10.200]  an ESG thing, getting rid of, getting rid of, you know, modern fertilizer. Now they're
[2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:16.160]  trying to push the Dutch farmers off the land. So country, each country that it happens to
[2:55:16.160 --> 2:55:23.320]  first serves to wake up the rest of the world. So they're just bringing in the great reset,
[2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:28.200]  the build back better, great reset. I think that they see that that's a failing plan.
[2:55:28.200 --> 2:55:34.000]  And even the, the, the great pandemic so-called, that wasn't quite the pandemic that they needed
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:38.520]  for the great reset. So that what they're going to do is push for the great war. The
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:42.440]  great war will be the one that erases all the, you know, and at the end of the day,
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:46.200]  they always tell people, if you don't accept global government, there's going to be war.
[2:55:46.200 --> 2:55:50.800]  The UN says that the Debo script says, do we say there'll be a war? And now they're
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:55.640]  showing us. So do you think Putin falls for that trap?
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:01.280]  In the time that I have left here, I have, I feel really like bound to say something
[2:56:01.280 --> 2:56:10.080]  as like on a public apology. In a sense, Stewart Rhodes, the head of the Oath Keepers, I had
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:15.120]  considered in the same category as Ray Epps because he was not arrested, even though he
[2:56:15.120 --> 2:56:21.160]  was like, you know, person number one with the FBI, et cetera. And, and I had assumed
[2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:27.760]  he was in the same Ray Epps mold. And he was arrested a couple months or not, not too
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:34.160]  long ago, but he spends 22 hours a day in a 12 by eight cell. All right, this is American
[2:56:34.160 --> 2:56:39.440]  Gulag stuff. And it's a shame. And I'm, and I want to personally apologize to Stewart
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:47.400]  Rhodes for, for putting him in the Ray Epps league at all ever, you know, even implying
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:53.800]  it. So I'm, I, I'm sorry for that. But, and it's, and he's not the only one and neither
[2:56:53.800 --> 2:56:58.240]  is Master Sergeant Jeremy Brown is down in Pinellas County jail in Florida.
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:03.040]  There's a lot of confusion, Matt Bracken, the fog of war. Join us again next week for

[2:59:56.160 --> 3:00:10.160]  A month they worry of me, me stride, today's time so you meet, meet, ride.
[3:00:10.160 --> 3:00:15.400]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up next segment, and I want to air a few minutes of
[3:00:15.400 --> 3:00:20.800]  batgates, taking it to them. When they won't say what a woman is, when they won't say what
[3:00:20.800 --> 3:00:25.600]  a man is, it's because they don't want to say what a baby is. They want to teach us
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:30.800]  to have no limits and put up with anything they're putting anything they're doing.
[3:00:30.800 --> 3:00:36.520]  And it's sick and it's degenerate evil. We're going to play this clip, go to break, come
[3:00:36.520 --> 3:00:42.360]  back and go to Tyler, Fabio, Jefferson, HB and Robert, here before the great J. Dyer,
[3:00:42.360 --> 3:00:47.800]  who always takes over. But I got to tell you, it's one hell of a time to be alive right
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:55.040]  now, and I cannot express the listeners enough. You see how we're at game time. You see how
[3:00:55.040 --> 3:01:03.480]  it's all down to the line right now. And I, for strategic reasons, don't want the enemy
[3:01:03.480 --> 3:01:06.920]  to know where their targeting is working, so I can't tell you all the stuff that's going
[3:01:06.920 --> 3:01:11.640]  on at this point. But down the road if I can, I will, but let me just explain something.
[3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:17.720]  We're on the verge of total victory or total defeat. We are in incredibly important time
[3:01:17.720 --> 3:01:23.360]  right now and God's in control, not the Satanist. So I just want to take a little bit of time
[3:01:23.360 --> 3:01:27.480]  out here to salute the boom operator of that camera and the crew and they're making the
[3:01:27.480 --> 3:01:32.160]  switches and getting the guests on and run the show and view the audience and our affiliates,
[3:01:32.160 --> 3:01:36.320]  almost 400 radio affiliates right now. The broadcast is exploding because people get,
[3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:41.160]  man, this Jones isn't crazy. He knows what he's talking about. So thanks to all your
[3:01:41.160 --> 3:01:47.600]  work, we are in a position to affect the world more than ever at a critical space. And that's
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:52.160]  why God put us in this position. And everything we've done so far was just to put us in this
[3:01:52.160 --> 3:01:54.560]  position right now. Here's Matt Gaetz.
[3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:59.520]  Questions of the person who created a great deal of confusion by saying that this matter
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:04.840]  was for the reproductive freedom of women. And I appreciate her yielding to a few questions
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:09.720]  that I think clarified that point. If the gentle lady would yield to another clarifying
[3:02:09.720 --> 3:02:13.080]  question and I'm not here to make a partisan argument, I'm here to understand the effect
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:18.280]  of the bill and what you're talking about in support of the bill. You used the phrase
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:26.360]  unborn child in your most recent debate. What does that phrase mean to you?
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:30.280]  Mr. Gaetz, Ms. Bass would like to answer your questions.
[3:02:30.280 --> 3:02:31.720]  Well, then she can strike the last word.
[3:02:31.720 --> 3:02:34.880]  I am finished with you right now and I do not yield.
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:39.680]  So that's telling, right? I mean, I'm just here trying to get answers and questions.
[3:02:39.680 --> 3:02:44.200]  Ms. Bass, you didn't use the words that were confusing, so I'm not going to yield to you.
[3:02:44.200 --> 3:02:45.880]  Thank you. It is my bill.
[3:02:45.880 --> 3:02:47.840]  But you didn't use the words in description of it.
[3:02:47.840 --> 3:02:48.840]  And guess what?
[3:02:48.840 --> 3:02:50.320]  It was Ms. Ross who used those words.
[3:02:50.320 --> 3:02:51.320]  Who was what?
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:53.880]  If I were to ask questions to Ms. Ross, she could choose whether or not to yield to give
[3:02:53.880 --> 3:02:59.120]  the answers. But you covering for her doesn't know the words that she uses and cannot enter
[3:02:59.120 --> 3:03:04.080]  the Judiciary Committee, sit and answer the questions on something as important as life
[3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:06.240]  or death when I control the time.
[3:03:06.240 --> 3:03:07.240]  Is outrageous.
[3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:08.240]  Are you done?
[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:09.800]  I'm done when my term is done.
[3:03:09.800 --> 3:03:11.560]  Mr. Gaetz, it's time.
[3:03:11.560 --> 3:03:16.160]  You can yield for those questions, but it's crazy that in this committee, when I'm trying
[3:03:16.160 --> 3:03:20.000]  to get honest answers to questions about the effect of the bill, whether or not it paves
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:24.040]  the way to abortions, that you all want to sit up there and squawk at me rather than allow
[3:03:24.040 --> 3:03:28.720]  me to ask questions. When you have the time, you can control the time. How about that?
[3:03:28.720 --> 3:03:31.840]  But these are fair questions. She used the phrase, unborn child.
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:32.840]  This is ridiculous.
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:37.720]  I would like to know what that means to her, because what it means to Ms. Ross is that
[3:03:37.720 --> 3:03:38.720]  it is a life.
[3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.720]  But you know what? I want the answer on the record, Ms. Bass. I want the answer for the
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:47.200]  American people, because to all of us, my party that was impugned, we actually think that
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:52.240]  unborn life is a child, and that there is a liberty interest there that is worthy of
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:03:58.480]  our defense and our protection and the values that undergird the American Constitution.
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:03.640]  I don't think that's too unreasonable. And by the way, if you use a phrase in this committee,
[3:04:03.640 --> 3:04:07.760]  you shouldn't have to have a senior member answer the questions for you. You should be
[3:04:07.760 --> 3:04:12.120]  able to answer those questions yourself. And if not, I think it speaks to the credibility
[3:04:12.120 --> 3:04:14.200]  of the debate that is offered.
[3:04:14.200 --> 3:04:17.920]  So I'll yield, Ms. Bass. I got 50 seconds.
[3:04:17.920 --> 3:04:23.360]  Thank you. I would like for us to vote on the amendment. I think the bill is clear.
[3:04:23.360 --> 3:04:27.240]  The rest of this discussion is theater. I would like to vote on the amendment.
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:29.680]  Can we vote on the amendment, Mr. Chair?
[3:04:29.680 --> 3:04:34.080]  I'll tell you what, Ms. Bass, reclaiming my time, we'll vote when we're damn well ready
[3:04:34.080 --> 3:04:35.360]  and when we're done answering our questions.
[3:04:35.360 --> 3:04:36.960]  Oh, you chair the committee now?
[3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:41.720]  No. We have rights in the minority to utilize time under the five-minute rule to be able
[3:04:41.720 --> 3:04:46.440]  to offer our perspective on matters. And we're sorry if you all are in such a rush to kill
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.560]  unborn life that you're unwilling to answer our questions. But you know what? The good
[3:04:50.560 --> 3:04:57.560]  news is with the Supreme Court we currently have, this is now a pro-life country.
[3:05:43.520 --> 3:05:48.280]  now whether you need this or not you need it. Before it was just a backup plan of insurance.
[3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:55.280]  This is an insurance. This is survival. Preparetoday.com. Preparetoday.com and I'll see you there!
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:20.280]  What's going on, Alex? How are you doing today?
[3:06:20.280 --> 3:06:22.280]  Man, I'm fighting hard, brother.
[3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:28.960]  Oh, man, we're with you, man. Hey, quick question I had for you. What do you think the people
[3:06:28.960 --> 3:06:33.280]  are going to start standing up maybe taking action in their own hands? I kind of feel
[3:06:33.280 --> 3:06:39.280]  like another lockdown might get something going, you know? I mean, not saying it's going
[3:06:39.280 --> 3:06:43.280]  to be great, but it's going to be, I think maybe a little bit better.
[3:06:43.280 --> 3:06:46.680]  You're right. They're getting their new lockdown ready. I think people saw through the first
[3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:49.680]  one, thought they had to back off, but they can't help themselves. They're going to try
[3:06:49.680 --> 3:06:52.680]  it again and I think that will blow up in their face.
[3:06:52.680 --> 3:06:56.680]  Oh, yeah. No, absolutely. After my, I had a little Fourth of July get together, celebrate
[3:06:56.680 --> 3:07:01.680]  being American and my whole coldest second, you know, we're all, we're Trump people,
[3:07:01.680 --> 3:07:06.680]  you know, we're in Kansas, you know, we're red. So we, everybody, but we're sick and
[3:07:06.680 --> 3:07:10.160]  tired of this, man. I mean, I just, I have a feeling that something's going to happen
[3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:14.680]  and it might not be something good. It might take some lives. I don't know, but I think
[3:07:14.680 --> 3:07:20.680]  the good news is we got people in Latin America and Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe
[3:07:20.680 --> 3:07:24.680]  and Russia and every damn old place that are awake and know what's going on and they're
[3:07:24.680 --> 3:07:28.680]  fighting back everywhere, brother. So the new world order is in trouble. They admit that
[3:07:28.680 --> 3:07:29.680]  in their own publications.
[3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:33.680]  I hear you, Alex. That's all I was saying, man. I appreciate you. I'll let you get to
[3:07:33.680 --> 3:07:36.680]  the other callers and have a wonderful, wonderful evening, man. I appreciate you.
[3:07:36.680 --> 3:07:41.680]  You too, brother. Love you. Thank you. Let's talk to a caller in Texas. A lot of calls
[3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:46.680]  from Texas today. Robert, you're on the air. Hey, Alex, though, I was going to call and
[3:07:46.680 --> 3:07:50.680]  talk about Rayups and Rayups never talks about Stuart Rhodes or anything like that, but I
[3:07:50.680 --> 3:07:55.680]  thought that was kind of a downer. So I thought instead I'd let you finish the show on an
[3:07:55.680 --> 3:08:01.680]  up note and just say, if anybody's looked into that Bitcoin transaction from the anonymous
[3:08:01.680 --> 3:08:06.680]  donor, that's really cool because you can trace it all the way back to the point where
[3:08:06.680 --> 3:08:12.680]  all of that Bitcoin got into the wallet that gave the money to you or gave the Bitcoin
[3:08:12.680 --> 3:08:19.680]  to you. And you find out that that was like 29 transactions, all that occurred on January
[3:08:19.680 --> 3:08:29.680]  20th of 2016. So that's like Trump's inauguration date. So somebody got a big, a big pile of
[3:08:29.680 --> 3:08:36.680]  money on Trump's inauguration date, and then seven, eight years later gave it to you. And
[3:08:36.680 --> 3:08:41.680]  he got me thinking that it's probably Chuck C. Johnson is your anonymous Bitcoin donor.
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:49.680]  And I just wanted to say Chuck C. Johnson. Who's that? You don't know who Chuck C. Johnson
[3:08:49.680 --> 3:08:56.680]  is. Tell me. Okay. Well, just Google it, man. Have a good day. You're on here. Tell us.
[3:08:56.680 --> 3:09:04.680]  All right, probably prank caller. Let's talk to Jefferson of Virginia. Jefferson, you're
[3:09:04.680 --> 3:09:11.680]  on the air. Alex, I was moved by your miscarriage story, reminding me of the Jeremiah I knew
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:16.680]  you before I formed you in the womb. I think it's very likely that souls don't enter the
[3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:23.680]  fetus until the brain is big enough to be a transceiver for the soul. You're probably
[3:09:23.680 --> 3:09:28.680]  right, brother. I think there's a way out of this mess. Maybe I should talk to you off
[3:09:28.680 --> 3:09:33.680]  here, but I think you can monetize this argument. I think if you talk to a child, much like
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:38.680]  Nick Sandman, you can turn yourself into a moneymaker on this argument, how we get these
[3:09:38.680 --> 3:09:46.680]  people out of office. USC 18, title 18, 1918, they're all in violation of their oath because
[3:09:46.680 --> 3:09:52.680]  Kamala Harris is not a natural born citizen. If you make an interview with a child making
[3:09:52.680 --> 3:09:57.680]  that argument and you take the opposing view, that will go viral and you will get rich when
[3:09:57.680 --> 3:10:02.680]  that child gets defamed by the media that you hate so much, the fake media.
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:07.680]  Well, I'm sorry I'm not as smart as you and I mean that for real, Jefferson. Do I do a
[3:10:07.680 --> 3:10:09.680]  mock interview with Kamala Harris or what are you saying?
[3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:15.680]  No, no. You need like a Nick Sandman child to take the position that Kamala Harris is
[3:10:15.680 --> 3:10:20.680]  not a natural born citizen. You do the interview with the child making the opposing view that
[3:10:20.680 --> 3:10:26.680]  the child is wrong. So that will become a viral video where the media has to attack the child
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:30.680]  for saying that Kamala Harris is illegally in office and you don't get in trouble for
[3:10:30.680 --> 3:10:33.680]  being the interviewer that's saying that the child is wrong.
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:38.680]  All right, Jefferson, I appreciate your call. HB in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:43.680]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man? Hey, I got a whole bunch of stuff here, but you mentioned
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:49.680]  Pretender. We said Pretender all ago. We used to watch this show called Pretender and they
[3:10:49.680 --> 3:10:54.680]  adept these kids and they take them to this place called the Center and make them run
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:11:01.680]  simulations. It was like MK Ultra. So the other night we're watching a show called Gotham
[3:11:01.680 --> 3:11:08.680]  reruns from the 90s and it's about Adrenochrome. So this whole thing is just, it's too much.
[3:11:08.680 --> 3:11:12.680]  That was like from the mid 90s. They're thrown in our face, aren't they?
[3:11:12.680 --> 3:11:18.680]  They are. It was wild. I mean, I didn't see that the first time through and watch those shows
[3:11:18.680 --> 3:11:22.680]  you know, 10 years or so to go back and see them. It was really wild. But I want to know
[3:11:22.680 --> 3:11:29.680]  a little bit about the CBDC. How in the hell is that going to work if they're rioting over
[3:11:29.680 --> 3:11:34.680]  in China? Do you think the US will riot when they shut our bank accounts down and we can't
[3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:38.680]  trade our precious metals in for CBDC? What's going to happen?
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:43.680]  No, you're right. They're doing a beta test in China right now for America. It's all going
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:48.680]  down right now. Thank you, HB. Anything else? He's gone. Fabio in Canada, you're on the
[3:11:48.680 --> 3:11:49.680]  gear. Go ahead.
[3:11:49.680 --> 3:11:51.680]  How are you, Alec?
[3:11:51.680 --> 3:11:52.680]  Good, brother.
[3:11:52.680 --> 3:11:59.680]  I just want to thank you, Owen, Gregory, Harrison. You guys are doing an amazing job. I'm up
[3:11:59.680 --> 3:12:08.680]  here in Canada and you guys basically make, with all this tyranny, all this evil, all
[3:12:08.680 --> 3:12:15.680]  this demonic behavior worthwhile because you are the positive light in the world of darkness.
[3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:18.680]  Well, we're trying, brother, as hard as we can.
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:26.680]  I have a question. So I'm in Canada. We had a Canada-wide outage for Rogers and it was
[3:12:26.680 --> 3:12:32.680]  on the exact day of cyber-polygon. Do you believe that is related? Do you believe that's
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:38.680]  definitely the globalist tells what we're going to do next? First was a viral attack.
[3:12:38.680 --> 3:12:40.680]  Next was a cyber-power outage. Absolutely.
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:45.680]  All right. And I just want to thank you. You guys are doing a great job and just keep up
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:49.680]  the great work and fight the power and glory to be to God.
[3:12:49.680 --> 3:12:56.680]  Absolutely, brother. God bless you. You know, I didn't get to this today because it's so
[3:12:56.680 --> 3:13:01.680]  outrageous and because it's happening to us. It's like hard to talk about because it's
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:09.680]  so weird. It's like not believable. But the judge in Texas on the fake show trial Sandy
[3:13:09.680 --> 3:13:14.680]  Hook, then coming up in August entered an order saying we can't talk about the First
[3:13:14.680 --> 3:13:22.680]  Amendment. We can't talk about free speech. We can't talk about America. It's official.
[3:13:22.680 --> 3:13:28.680]  And now in Connecticut, they have their experts listed about white supremism to
[3:13:28.680 --> 3:13:33.680]  say I'm a white supremacist of the jury. What the hell does white supremacy have to do
[3:13:33.680 --> 3:13:39.680]  with us questioning the events of Sandy Hook? But they already defaulted to this.
[3:13:39.680 --> 3:13:42.680]  They already said we're guilty. They're going to tell a jury they're guilty and
[3:13:42.680 --> 3:13:47.680]  they're white supremacist. I don't feel bad for myself having that happen.
[3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:53.680]  I sit back and I go, what is it they won't do? They have weaponized judiciary.
[3:13:53.680 --> 3:13:59.680]  They've weaponized Congress with the January 6th committee. They don't care.
[3:13:59.680 --> 3:14:03.680]  And anybody playing games with this, anybody going along with this system is a
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:07.680]  fool because you can pretend you're part of the power structure. You can pretend
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:12.680]  you're going along with it. You're part of it, but you're not. You're not.
[3:14:12.680 --> 3:14:16.680]  It doesn't matter who's involved or who's engaged in it. This is tyranny.
[3:14:16.680 --> 3:14:23.680]  Tyranny has come to America, world government, world IDs, mark of the beast.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.680]  It's all here. And so I have faith in humanity and I see the political class
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:34.680]  that's gone totally insane. And I just say we've got to stay out of their way
[3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:37.680]  while they collapse because they are destroying themselves and they're trying
[3:14:37.680 --> 3:14:42.680]  to claw us down with them and drag us down into the system with themselves.
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:47.680]  Jay Dyer is set to take over for the next 45 minutes ahead of the war with
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:51.680]  Owen Schreuer. I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank you all

[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:20.680]  Welcome back to the Altshah Junction. Your guest host Jay Dyer of jsonalysis.com. We've lectured through many, many of the writings of the global elite.
[3:20:20.680 --> 3:20:24.680]  And today I want to cover a book that you might have heard Alex mention earlier this week.
[3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:28.680]  It's a very well-known book and it's a great compliment to Dr. Carol Quigley's
[3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:33.680]  book Tragedy and Hope and his other book The Anglo-American Establishment detailing
[3:20:33.680 --> 3:20:38.680]  the means and methods of the Atlantis' power block in the 20th century, how they
[3:20:38.680 --> 3:20:42.680]  orchestrated the two world wars and then the Cold War. There's another professor
[3:20:42.680 --> 3:20:46.680]  that you again may not have heard about or may not have read his books. His name is
[3:20:46.680 --> 3:20:51.680]  Professor Anthony Sutton and he was a professor of economics from England who
[3:20:51.680 --> 3:20:57.680]  eventually became a U.S. citizen. And he wrote several famous books, the first of
[3:20:57.680 --> 3:21:00.680]  which is what we're going to talk about today and I won't be able to go into the whole
[3:21:00.680 --> 3:21:05.680]  book but I'll give you an introduction to this work and then if you go over to my
[3:21:05.680 --> 3:21:10.680]  channel on YouTube or over on Rockfin in the next couple of days I'm going to lecture
[3:21:10.680 --> 3:21:15.680]  through the totality of the book and it's called Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution.
[3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:19.680]  Now you might think, well, you know what, so this is just another conspiracy book.
[3:21:19.680 --> 3:21:24.680]  Now as you know what we do is we lecture through the books of the professors, of the
[3:21:24.680 --> 3:21:29.680]  academics, of the elite themselves. Now Professor Sutton was not initially some kind
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:34.680]  of conspiracy theorist but the more that he dug into congressional records and
[3:21:34.680 --> 3:21:40.680]  declassified cables and so forth, he started noticing a pattern of the
[3:21:40.680 --> 3:21:45.680]  dialectic of the capitalist or the monopoly capitalist and the Soviet Marxist
[3:21:45.680 --> 3:21:51.680]  socialist not to be a real dialectic. In fact, it's a manipulated dialectic and one
[3:21:51.680 --> 3:21:55.680]  of the things he put at the beginning of the book which by the way this book came out
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:22:03.680]  in 1974 so this is not that old of a text. He includes a cartoon where he shows
[3:22:03.680 --> 3:22:12.680]  in 1911 a cartoonist for the St. Louis Dispatch had drawn this cartoon which kind of
[3:22:12.680 --> 3:22:17.680]  spills the beans here and what you see is a bunch of industrialists, a bunch of
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:22.680]  wealthy capitalists shaking hands and befriending Karl Marx.
[3:22:22.680 --> 3:22:27.680]  Well wait a minute, I thought that the enemy of the capitalist, the enemy of
[3:22:27.680 --> 3:22:34.680]  the person who wants to obtain wealth and industry and so forth isn't his
[3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:39.680]  greatest enemy, the Marxist socialist aren't they, the paradigm opposites?
[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:44.680]  Well as we said as Professor Sutton dug deeper and deeper into the history of
[3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:49.680]  Bolshevism, Marxism, Communism, Socialism, etc., and Fascism as well, he has
[3:22:49.680 --> 3:22:53.680]  another book called Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler. He started noticing
[3:22:53.680 --> 3:22:58.680]  that well the first question that we should ask is there's no revolution that
[3:22:58.680 --> 3:23:04.680]  can obtain any success without money. Have you ever thought about that?
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:09.680]  Where do revolutionaries get their money? Especially revolutionaries that at
[3:23:09.680 --> 3:23:14.680]  least claim or appear to be critical of money, critical of capital, critical of
[3:23:14.680 --> 3:23:19.680]  industry, critical of private property, well who's funding that? I mean is it
[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:24.680]  really the case that Marxism, Socialism are movements for the grassroots,
[3:23:24.680 --> 3:23:28.680]  movements for the people? Now they might have people amongst them that are
[3:23:28.680 --> 3:23:34.680]  grassroots and really believe in the story and the mythology of the oppressor,
[3:23:34.680 --> 3:23:39.680]  the oppressor narrative and the class warfare, but it does seem like it takes
[3:23:39.680 --> 3:23:44.680]  money to have a revolution, especially to overthrow a government. And if you
[3:23:44.680 --> 3:23:48.680]  heard the Greg Rees report that he just put out that was really good about
[3:23:48.680 --> 3:23:52.680]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins, you know he talks about in
[3:23:52.680 --> 3:23:58.680]  that little clip the success of the CIA working at the behest of the Rockefellers
[3:23:58.680 --> 3:24:03.680]  and the big money at overthrowing dozens and dozens and dozens of countries
[3:24:03.680 --> 3:24:08.680]  in the US. There have been coups going all the way back to the 1800s that the
[3:24:08.680 --> 3:24:12.680]  power structure that the intelligentsia and the wealthy had themselves really
[3:24:12.680 --> 3:24:16.680]  been behind. And so the reason this book is so important is that it's kind of
[3:24:16.680 --> 3:24:21.680]  an addendum to Dr. Quigley's work, not just showing the manipulation of
[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:25.680]  revolutions or the support of liberalism on the part of very wealthy people,
[3:24:25.680 --> 3:24:30.680]  but actually tracing the money for the funding of the actors on the revolutionary
[3:24:30.680 --> 3:24:35.680]  stage. So the first thing he notes as he begins the book is that there's a letter
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:39.680]  from one of the two President Woodrow Wilson who some people think was actually
[3:24:39.680 --> 3:24:44.680]  blackmailed by the banking elite. He had a handler named Colonel Edward Mandel
[3:24:44.680 --> 3:24:48.680]  House who seemed to have been the go between from the banking elite and Woodrow
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:53.680]  Wilson. So that's an interesting thing to keep in mind. But there's a letter
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:24:57.680]  written to President Woodrow Wilson from William Lawrence Saunders, the chairman
[3:24:57.680 --> 3:25:02.680]  of the Ingersoll Rand Corporation, also a director of the American International
[3:25:02.680 --> 3:25:06.680]  Corporation and deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
[3:25:06.680 --> 3:25:11.680]  And he says, I am in very much, I'm in sympathy with the Soviet government.
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:17.680]  It is best suited for the Russian people. So the head of the Federal Reserve
[3:25:17.680 --> 3:25:23.680]  of New York writes a letter to Woodrow Wilson, president, saying, I'm a big
[3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:28.680]  fan of Bolshevism, of Sovietism. But again, how can we make sense of this?
[3:25:28.680 --> 3:25:33.680]  I remember that here on the fourth hour I've covered many times David Rockefeller's
[3:25:33.680 --> 3:25:39.680]  famous 1979 New York Times editorial where he says that Chairman Mao was a
[3:25:39.680 --> 3:25:44.680]  great experiment. The Chinese Maoist experiment was a great success and how
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:50.680]  much he loves Mao because that social experiment had the benefit of completely
[3:25:50.680 --> 3:25:55.680]  renovating, bulldozing Chinese society and putting it under the ages of the
[3:25:55.680 --> 3:26:00.680]  power elite, the internationalists. Rockefeller brags about that in a
[3:26:00.680 --> 3:26:06.680]  famous editorial. And so the same principle is at work here where all the
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:14.680]  way back in the early 19s, 1910s, we had this evidence popping up that
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:18.680]  Professor Sutton, Dr. Sutton noticed that the key issue here is that the
[3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:24.680]  false left-right dialectic needs to be exposed insofar as it relates to the
[3:26:24.680 --> 3:26:27.680]  Cold War, he says. Remember this book comes out during the period of the
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:31.680]  Cold War. And he says that it needs to be exposed because there is an alliance,
[3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:37.680]  a hidden alliance between monopoly capital on Wall Street and Marxism
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:43.680]  socialism. For example, revolutionaries such as Lenin and Trotsky would find
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:48.680]  unsuspecting supporters in the figures of J.P. Morgan, John D. Rockefeller and
[3:26:48.680 --> 3:26:54.680]  other European bankers who he has later chapters covering. So it's just amazing
[3:26:54.680 --> 3:26:59.680]  how much foresight and how much perceptiveness, especially for the
[3:26:59.680 --> 3:27:03.680]  70s in the middle of the Cold War that Professor Sutton had working at the
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:07.680]  Hoover Institute to realize, hey, wait a minute, big money loves Marxism
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:12.680]  socialism. This is even before you had David Rockefeller writing his famous
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:18.680]  editorials. And so Professor Sutton was just a hero in that sense in terms of
[3:27:18.680 --> 3:27:22.680]  digging into, we need to figure out where these revolutionaries get their
[3:27:22.680 --> 3:27:28.680]  money. So the first names that he comes upon are, as we said, the big
[3:27:28.680 --> 3:27:32.680]  monopoly capitalists and bankers, J.P. Morgan, J.D. Rockefeller. And then as he
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:38.680]  dug deeper and deeper, he uncovered all kinds of secretive cables and memos
[3:27:38.680 --> 3:27:45.680]  and money transfers and loans that had been doled out, not just to the
[3:27:45.680 --> 3:27:50.680]  Tsarist government to get them into debt, but also secretive money transfers,
[3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:54.680]  wire transfers, gold transfers to the revolutionaries themselves, like
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:28:00.680]  Lenin and Trotsky. Now, one point that he makes early on that's very perceptive
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:05.680]  for what we've gone through in recent times is bailouts. In fact, he says
[3:28:05.680 --> 3:28:11.680]  that there's a reason that the bankers love these loans and that they love
[3:28:11.680 --> 3:28:16.680]  socialism. Socialism creates the situation of corporate welfare. We hear all
[3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:20.680]  the time people complaining about, oh, those are the lazy people out there
[3:28:20.680 --> 3:28:25.680]  that just want their EBT costs. Why my EBT? Why my EBT? But it turns out the
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:31.680]  biggest socialists and welfare people are the corporations. Remember how
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.680]  the government would get money from the government? Corporate welfare? And I
[3:28:35.680 --> 3:28:38.680]  think the only person I remember even calling this out back in the day was
[3:28:38.680 --> 3:28:43.680]  Ron Paul and Alex Jones. And so socialism is not the enemy of the
[3:28:43.680 --> 3:28:48.680]  corporatist. It is the friend of the corporate elite. So as we continue,
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:51.680]  we'll get deeper into this as the Alex Jones show doesn't go anywhere. This is
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:56.680]  J.Dyer guest hosting for the Info War over on Alex. There is nothing,
[3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:02.680]  there is no more epitome of free speech than right here. And that's what
[3:29:02.680 --> 3:29:06.680]  people recognize and resonate with. And as Ward said, you're not going to
[3:29:06.680 --> 3:29:10.680]  find a better place for information. You might not agree with everything. You

[3:33:05.680 --> 3:33:14.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones. I'm your guest host Jay Dyer for the fourth hour.
[3:33:14.680 --> 3:33:20.680]  We are covering the classic very important text from 1974 from Professor Anthony Sutton Wall Street in the
[3:33:20.680 --> 3:33:26.680]  Bolshevik Revolution. Part of his trilogy where he looked into the real story behind not just the
[3:33:26.680 --> 3:33:31.680]  revolutions of the left but also the revolutionary right wing philosophy or the
[3:33:31.680 --> 3:33:37.680]  fascist tradition and where they got their money in his other book Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler.
[3:33:37.680 --> 3:33:43.680]  And then also he looks into the person of FDR and so what about FDR and the banking elite behind FDR and that
[3:33:43.680 --> 3:33:50.680]  actually is backed up by the lesser known chapters in Dr. Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope where he talks about
[3:33:50.680 --> 3:33:56.680]  the bankers utilizing FDR to put the country into debt through the public works project.
[3:33:56.680 --> 3:34:02.680]  So they did have the ability at least for some time for about a decade to help the U.S. come out of the
[3:34:02.680 --> 3:34:08.680]  depression. But Dr. Quigley says that the banking elite knew very well that the public works projects,
[3:34:08.680 --> 3:34:14.680]  even though they might have put a band-aid on the debt for a time, all they did was put the country deeper into debt
[3:34:14.680 --> 3:34:22.680]  for the next generation that came along. And so he discusses in passing in Tragedy and Hope the boom bus cycle
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:27.680]  and how there's a sort of a two-step back and forward that happens back and forth that happens sometimes between
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:34.680]  generations even where the elite can push privatization for a time period which consolidates and then they can push
[3:34:34.680 --> 3:34:41.680]  collectivization and liberal ideas for the next decade. And so there's a boom bus cycle that can be manipulated
[3:34:41.680 --> 3:34:48.680]  and even the depressions themselves are manipulated, the Great Depression being engineered and triggered on purpose
[3:34:48.680 --> 3:34:55.680]  in my view. And so the reason that again Sutton's book is so important is that he also came to those same conclusions
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:35:03.680]  through studying the cables and the congressional records and these archives that covered a lot of these
[3:35:03.680 --> 3:35:11.680]  lesser known transmissions of money, lesser known cables that have been sent between embassies about funding the
[3:35:11.680 --> 3:35:17.680]  revolution and how it wasn't the U.S. government but very wealthy, higher people, people above the level of government
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:24.680]  that were on board with the revolutionaries, not because they believed the philosophy of Marxism, Communism,
[3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:30.680]  Leninism or whatever, but because they see it as a useful tool for destroying the existing order and preparing
[3:35:30.680 --> 3:35:38.680]  the way for through the collectivization of the wealth in the industry then to come in when it collapses
[3:35:38.680 --> 3:35:44.680]  and buy it up for pennies on the dollar and transfer that wealth offshore after the collectivization process.
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:51.680]  This is always the standard cycle that the elite use as a scam and that's why the boom bus cycle itself is a
[3:35:51.680 --> 3:35:57.680]  manipulated and engineered scam. And that's again something that even Ron Paul has talked about for a long time
[3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:03.680]  and he's completely correct about that because both Quigley and Sutton had come to the same conclusions
[3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:09.680]  again from different vantage points. Quigley, of course, being the proponent of this system, a believer in the
[3:36:09.680 --> 3:36:15.680]  New World Order system, a big apologist for it, Sutton being more of a critic of it and pointing out that
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:23.680]  this is going to lead us into a bad place. And he goes on to say, well, if we look at the structure of this
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:31.680]  supporting and funding of revolutions, we'll notice that socialists always get money from industry bankers
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:39.680]  and monopoly capitalists. That always seems to be the case. And then he says that again, this is because it
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:44.680]  collectivizes the wealth and we can even begin to understand how Woodrow Wilson played into this because
[3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:50.680]  of course he played a big role as the tool of the banking elite and helping to push forward support for
[3:36:50.680 --> 3:36:57.680]  not just World War I but also for the centralized banking power in the U.S., right? We get the Federal Reserve
[3:36:57.680 --> 3:37:04.680]  again in 1913, which is one of the planks of the Communist Manifesto. Now, I don't think that the Federal Reserve
[3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:10.680]  and what's happening in America is a Marxist conspiracy per se because it's higher than that, right?
[3:37:10.680 --> 3:37:19.680]  And so what a lot of people like Anthony Sutton and people that were looking into the Communist takeover,
[3:37:19.680 --> 3:37:27.680]  right? What McCarthy and others, what they were really stumbling upon without knowing it was high, high-level
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:33.680]  industrialists and capitalists in Wall Street funding for liberalism and socialism, which they mistook to be
[3:37:33.680 --> 3:37:40.680]  a sort of grassroots or a foreign power running that operation. And it wasn't Moscow primarily.
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:45.680]  Now, Moscow was a Soviet government. But again, the point that Sutton makes is that there wouldn't have been
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:52.680]  a Moscow, a Soviet government or anything like that if you hadn't had treason at the highest, wealthiest levels
[3:37:52.680 --> 3:37:58.680]  in the West to support those movements. And so he says industrialists and bankers formed the support,
[3:37:58.680 --> 3:38:04.680]  first of all, for Trotsky and the U.S. Bolsheviks in the U.S. were big supporters of Woodrow Wilson
[3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:12.680]  because they saw him as an ally. And so you get this important support for Trotsky, oil money, Wall Street,
[3:38:12.680 --> 3:38:20.680]  through oil, magnets and oil money supported the Bolshevik Revolution. And he ends his first chapter
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:27.680]  by saying that this is really a kind of a dialectic. And I think that's the key point here is that to understand
[3:38:27.680 --> 3:38:34.680]  dialectics is just to understand the philosophy of opposing power and forces of the good guys versus the bad guys,
[3:38:34.680 --> 3:38:40.680]  black versus white, night versus day, right? Now, I don't believe that those things are inherently bad
[3:38:40.680 --> 3:38:45.680]  or inherently evil or anything like that. But what happens is that through manipulation,
[3:38:45.680 --> 3:38:49.680]  people will take things that are distinct and try to smash them against one another.
[3:38:49.680 --> 3:38:57.680]  This is a central component of Marxism socialism. They actually believe that dialectical process is almost
[3:38:57.680 --> 3:39:04.680]  this sort of mystical evolutionary thing which brings about revolution. And so that's why Marxism has,
[3:39:04.680 --> 3:39:11.680]  as its fundamental core component, the idea of never ending revolution and never ending critique, never ending clash.
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:19.680]  It's a philosophy, a worldview of clashing. And that's why it's red because it's blood and it's warfare.
[3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:28.680]  It's never ending warfare, never ending destruction and chaos to bring about eternal revolution which produces
[3:39:28.680 --> 3:39:34.680]  the final stages which produces the utopia, which produces the omega point, right?
[3:39:34.680 --> 3:39:39.680]  These different philosophers of dialectics believe this. And so that's why they fund and promote
[3:39:39.680 --> 3:39:48.680]  and constantly refer to war, chaos, destabilization, and manipulated chaos.
[3:39:48.680 --> 3:39:54.680]  It's necessary in their view for the whole process. And that's why as a Marxist or as a socialist,
[3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:59.680]  as a revolutionary, you can't just be an academic. You can't just be in your ivory tower.
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:03.680]  You have to be out there involved in the streets. You have to be part of the praxis.
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:09.680]  And so for a Marxist socialist, praxis is just as important as knowing and understanding this esoteric
[3:40:09.680 --> 3:40:12.680]  mystery, religion, philosophy of Marxism.
[3:40:12.680 --> 3:40:18.680]  This is the first character that he goes into is Leon Trotsky. And he talks about how the U.S.
[3:40:18.680 --> 3:40:25.680]  intelligence agencies had at that time when Trotsky was in New York, they noticed that he had gotten,
[3:40:25.680 --> 3:40:32.680]  I think, $10,000 from a, quote, German source. And they couldn't figure out how between him going to New York
[3:40:32.680 --> 3:40:37.680]  and to Mexico and these different places that he had gotten, again, I think in the 19-teens, right?
[3:40:37.680 --> 3:40:41.680]  You know, $10,000 would be a lot more than it is now, probably like $100,000, right?
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:50.680]  So why would he get $10,000 from, quote, German elites? And it does appear to have come from the German government.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:56.680]  Well, it turns out that other information and cables disclosed, according to Professor Sutton,
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:03.680]  that this had come from another banking family in Sweden that had funneled the money to Germany
[3:41:03.680 --> 3:41:10.680]  to then send it to Trotsky so that it was kind of lost in concentric circles of, you know, networks of funding.
[3:41:10.680 --> 3:41:16.680]  In other words, it wasn't really German banking elites or interests or the German government,
[3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:22.680]  but it provided a cover to where it looked like people thought, oh, Trotsky, he's one of those German agents.
[3:41:22.680 --> 3:41:26.680]  Okay, but he wasn't a German agent.
[3:41:26.680 --> 3:41:32.680]  President Woodrow Wilson then provides a special passport for Trotsky.
[3:41:32.680 --> 3:41:40.680]  Why would the president provide an open Bolshevist, an open communist, a passport so that he could go to Russia?
[3:41:40.680 --> 3:41:46.680]  Well, if we believe, according to, you know, the academic story and history of the Federal Reserve,
[3:41:46.680 --> 3:41:50.680]  we know that it's because Colonel Edwin Mandelhouse was the agent of the banking elites,
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:55.680]  especially from the UK, to get Woodrow Wilson to do the things that were necessary.
[3:41:55.680 --> 3:42:00.680]  Again, some people claim that Woodrow Wilson was actually sexually blackmailed.
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:03.680]  I don't know for sure, but that's a theory that some historians have,
[3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:09.680]  that that's part of the reason that he was able to be cajoled into so many of these policies
[3:42:09.680 --> 3:42:14.680]  that helped the Federal Reserve elite, the banking elite, the international industrial elite.
[3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:18.680]  And so then you get companies like Crane, the Crane company,
[3:42:18.680 --> 3:42:24.680]  Westinghouse company, who begin to make moves towards supporting the Russian Revolution
[3:42:24.680 --> 3:42:27.680]  so that they can plan to set up their corporations in Russia.
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:32.680]  So in other words, you can begin to see that with the revolution and getting rid of the czar,
[3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:38.680]  then the corporations could be present in Russia and experience tremendous profits.
[3:42:38.680 --> 3:42:44.680]  And so we can see multiple motivations by different groups for the Russian Revolution.
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:47.680]  And that's not to say that there weren't, you know, problems in Russia,
[3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:49.680]  there wasn't poverty, there wasn't tyranny.
[3:42:49.680 --> 3:42:54.680]  Certainly there was, but is the answer, the solution for the elite always the best? No.
[3:42:54.680 --> 3:43:01.680]  Seven months ago in December of 2021, we launched the first in the three-coin founding member series,
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:03.680]  George Washington slaying the dragon.
[3:43:03.680 --> 3:43:08.680]  Then we launched the Tree of Liberty coin and finally the Second Amendment come and take it,
[3:43:08.680 --> 3:43:15.680]  Molan Labe coin. There are only 75 points left in the three-point series,

[3:47:06.680 --> 3:47:21.680]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This is your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis. You'll notice there on my website if you see that picture of me sitting there in that Tony Montana suit.
[3:47:21.680 --> 3:47:25.680]  In my library, if you go to that link, it will be an evening with Jay Dyer in Nashville, Tennessee.
[3:47:25.680 --> 3:47:33.680]  We've sold quite a few of the tickets. There's still a few left, so if you're interested in attending that, July 30th from 4pm to 10pm, you can come.
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:37.680]  The link's there at the website at Eventbrite and it'll be a fun evening.
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:44.680]  I'll be opening it up with an icebreaker of silly stuff, a lot of impressions and personations for the first hour.
[3:47:44.680 --> 3:47:56.680]  Then Jamie will be giving a talk on Hollywood and the esoteric from her books and then we'll have a talk on my new book, Meta Narratives Essays in Philosophy and Symbolism,
[3:47:56.680 --> 3:48:03.680]  which I did last week's fourth hour for Alex. We covered that in the fourth hour if you want to see more about what the book is about.
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:08.680]  It'll be going into a lot more depth in the live event for about a two hour talk on that.
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:17.680]  Then we'll open it up for Q&A. There's cameras and there's private security, so it is a secure event in North Nashville about a couple weeks from now.
[3:48:17.680 --> 3:48:22.680]  If you want to reserve your tickets, go ahead and do that. Again, it's North Nashville, Tennessee.
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:31.680]  If you're in Kentucky, if you're in Georgia, if you're in any of these other southern states in the area, go ahead and come on over.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:38.680]  We've got people flying in, so we've got already quite a few tickets sold, so I'm happy that so many people are going to make their way out.
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:46.680]  I might just expand that into other cities. Maybe we'll do a speaking event in Florida, Austin, Hollywood.
[3:48:46.680 --> 3:48:51.680]  Those are the cities that we usually done very well when we've done speaking events in the past.
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:54.680]  We'll look for that in the coming months as well.
[3:48:54.680 --> 3:49:01.680]  Next up, Dr. Sutton goes on to discuss in the Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, the character of Lenin.
[3:49:01.680 --> 3:49:12.680]  We find the exact same patterns with Lenin as we saw with Trotsky, where Lenin also seems to get curious German assistance for his Bolshevik Revolution.
[3:49:12.680 --> 3:49:28.680]  He cites a Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Kaiser in 1917 who had noticed that it was not until the Bolsheviks had received from us a steady flow of money through various channels
[3:49:28.680 --> 3:49:35.680]  and underlying labels that they were in a position to be able to build up their main organ, Pravda,
[3:49:35.680 --> 3:49:42.680]  and thus to conduct an energetic propaganda campaign, especially extending to the narrow base of their party.
[3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:51.680]  So Germans had noticed and mentioned and said that the success of the Bolsheviks kind of depended upon money that came from the German government.
[3:49:51.680 --> 3:50:01.680]  But as we know that money from the German government was actually a front, a cut out for other banking interests and people that he goes on to mention in the book later on.
[3:50:01.680 --> 3:50:11.680]  A guy named Olaf Ashberg, who was a Swedish banker, who sent money to both Trotsky and to Lenin, it appears, according to Professor Sutton.
[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:25.680]  Another important factor that seemed to be a cut out for pushing money to this revolution was the American International Corporation, which is one of the J.P. Morgan outfits.
[3:50:25.680 --> 3:50:37.680]  And so this is J.P. Morgan interest in the U.S. had as one of their subsidiaries this AIC, and AIC was one of the main ways that money was being pushed and sent to these revolutionaries.
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:50.680]  Because again, they had recognized that when the revolution occurred in Russia, this would free up a lot of resources, a lot of public works that could then be bought up by private interests.
[3:50:50.680 --> 3:50:56.680]  And so we need to understand that at this level, it's a lot more sophisticated than good guy, bad guy.
[3:50:56.680 --> 3:51:08.680]  It's a lot of pragmatic, high IQ, 66 dimensional chess, where you have people who can see what a revolution will do and then how to profit once that revolution occurs.
[3:51:08.680 --> 3:51:11.680]  And of course, they know that the revolutionary governments are not going to work.
[3:51:11.680 --> 3:51:12.680]  They know they're going to fail.
[3:51:12.680 --> 3:51:14.680]  They know they're going to collapse after a certain amount of time.
[3:51:14.680 --> 3:51:28.680]  And then when it collapses, because everyone at that level knows good and well that communism, Marxism, socialism are scams and their tricks to destroy societies, then you come in and buy it up for pennies on the dollar.
[3:51:28.680 --> 3:51:30.680]  This is really the whole thing.
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:37.680]  This is why it's so useful to the power elite, especially the mega elite.
[3:51:37.680 --> 3:51:38.680]  We're not talking about millionaires here.
[3:51:38.680 --> 3:51:40.680]  We're talking about billionaires.
[3:51:40.680 --> 3:52:06.680]  I mean, billionaires in 1900, billionaires that long ago, they had the foresight and the pragmatic concern because of that psychopathy, because of that control freak motivation to utilize Marxism for the benefit of industry and rebuilding society after all of this bloodshed and chaos.
[3:52:06.680 --> 3:52:13.680]  So again, it's a much bigger game than the supposed freedom that the revolutionaries are promising.
[3:52:13.680 --> 3:52:27.680]  And even the famous historian, who I think himself was a socialist, Audrelt Spangler, has the famous quote that there's never been a revolution of socialism or communism or Marxism that was not propped up by big money.
[3:52:27.680 --> 3:52:28.680]  Exactly.
[3:52:28.680 --> 3:52:32.680]  I mean, who pays for the revolutionaries to put out all the propaganda?
[3:52:32.680 --> 3:52:34.680]  Who pays for their speaking events?
[3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:40.680]  Who pays for them to travel all around the world promoting their revolutionary philosophy?
[3:52:40.680 --> 3:52:48.680]  You think that the revolutionaries, who almost in every case are just basically lazy, lay around pseudo academics?
[3:52:48.680 --> 3:52:59.680]  Do you think they have the money to fund traveling all over the globe and staying in these villas and traveling in high profile limousines and whatnot?
[3:52:59.680 --> 3:53:02.680]  I mean, this is always what's been the case with socialism, right?
[3:53:02.680 --> 3:53:04.680]  They're propped up by wealthy people.
[3:53:04.680 --> 3:53:06.680]  That's done in kind of the background.
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:14.680]  And it's a bigger game that's being played than the liberation of some tiny dictatorship somewhere.
[3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:25.680]  Russia, as we saw according to the global elites in this next chapter, is a future free market where the corporations could come in and rebuild it.
[3:53:25.680 --> 3:53:28.680]  Now, it's not a free market in the way that you probably think.
[3:53:28.680 --> 3:53:32.680]  Oh, they're going to be free and every Russian will be able to have his own business.
[3:53:32.680 --> 3:53:33.680]  No, no, no.
[3:53:33.680 --> 3:53:41.680]  It's a free market in the sense of the monopoly capitalists coming in to set up Chase Bank, just as we see in the Chinese Revolution.
[3:53:41.680 --> 3:53:44.680]  What's the first bank allowed into communist China?
[3:53:44.680 --> 3:53:45.680]  Chase Bank.
[3:53:45.680 --> 3:53:53.680]  There's a whole chapter in David Rockefeller's memoirs where he says, you know, because I love communist China,
[3:53:53.680 --> 3:54:00.680]  I was able to go over there and meet with them before Nixon did and set up Chase Bank in communist China.
[3:54:00.680 --> 3:54:07.680]  And so the next important point is that he kind of mentions in passing, something that a lot of people don't know about,
[3:54:07.680 --> 3:54:13.680]  that one of the covers, one of the fronts for getting money and support to the revolutionaries was the Red Cross.
[3:54:13.680 --> 3:54:23.680]  The Red Cross was an intelligence front even back then for giving support, money, aid, and probably eventually guns to the revolutionaries.
[3:54:23.680 --> 3:54:30.680]  And so, again, allied with the elite is not just the support for the Bolshevik revolutionaries,
[3:54:30.680 --> 3:54:36.680]  but using an intelligence cutout, which is an aid organization.
[3:54:36.680 --> 3:54:43.680]  I thought the Red Cross was going to help people and they're there to pass out, you know, supplies and band-aids to people that are, you know,
[3:54:43.680 --> 3:54:45.680]  have their arms blown off or whatever.
[3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:50.680]  Well, they might be doing that, but they're also supported by big money as well.
[3:54:50.680 --> 3:54:52.680]  You see, where do you think the Red Cross gets money?
[3:54:52.680 --> 3:54:54.680]  Oh, is it just giving?
[3:54:54.680 --> 3:55:01.680]  No, let's not be as naive as to think that everything that is presented to us is just as is presented.
[3:55:01.680 --> 3:55:05.680]  A lot of things like that are cutouts, a lot of things have been used.
[3:55:05.680 --> 3:55:14.680]  And then this next chapter, he goes into other examples where entities like Sullivan and Cromwell were instrumental via Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan's support
[3:55:14.680 --> 3:55:20.680]  in obtaining the, in black operations in the Panama Canal.
[3:55:20.680 --> 3:55:27.680]  He talks about funding from the elites to Chinese secret societies to support Sun Yat-sen.
[3:55:27.680 --> 3:55:36.680]  And then he talks about Marxism and socialism aiding the OSS in helping Mao in China.
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:37.680]  This is all declassified.
[3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:38.680]  I've covered this many times.
[3:55:38.680 --> 3:55:42.680]  Bill Donovan is who trained Mao's guerrillas.
[3:55:42.680 --> 3:55:47.680]  And so in 1974, Professor Sutton had talked about this.
[3:55:47.680 --> 3:55:54.680]  There was banking elite money that went into the support of the first Bolshevik Revolution, which happened in Mexico.
[3:55:54.680 --> 3:56:08.680]  And this is the support for Pancho Villa through the Guarantee Trust Company and money that was sent to Pancho Villa and the Carranza Revolution,
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:13.680]  which some historians call the pre-Bolshevik Revolution in Mexico.
[3:56:13.680 --> 3:56:20.680]  So they call it a dry run for a money-supported Bolshevik Revolution in Mexico.
[3:56:20.680 --> 3:56:30.680]  And so the Texas Revolution was a dry run for what would later be the banking revolution in Russia.
[3:56:30.680 --> 3:56:36.680]  Again, he picks out the American International Corporation, the National City Bank,
[3:56:36.680 --> 3:56:44.680]  and other entities as being fundamental in the Bolshevik rise to power and them getting that money.
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:51.680]  So again, fascinating book. If you want to head over to my YouTube channel, I'm almost at 100,000, so you can help me hit 100,000 this week.
[3:56:51.680 --> 3:56:54.680]  I'm going to be lecturing through the rest of this book, this excellent book,
[3:56:54.680 --> 3:57:02.680]  and then we'll probably move on to lecturing through Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler and then some of Sutton's other famous books that he put out
[3:57:02.680 --> 3:57:10.680]  about the curious case of the remarkable true story he says of American capitalists who finance Russian communism.
[3:57:10.680 --> 3:57:16.680]  We'll find the same thing to be the case with fascism. We'll find the same thing to be the case with all of these control systems.
[3:57:16.680 --> 3:57:23.680]  And the reason that we're talking about this is that what's coming about today, the great reset, everything that Klaus is pushing.
[3:57:23.680 --> 3:57:28.680]  Klaus has a bust of linen when he does his interviews. Why do you think Klaus has a bust of linen behind him?
[3:57:28.680 --> 3:57:35.680]  Is it because Klaus actually believes in Marxism? Well, Klaus is a revolutionary in the sense of being a post-human.
[3:57:35.680 --> 3:57:41.680]  And so in that sense he is, but he's also beyond that because he understands, I think, at that level that it's a bigger game.
[3:57:41.680 --> 3:58:06.680]  This is the Alex Jones Show and I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
