[00:00.000 --> 00:18.480]  Info wars tomorrow's news today
[00:31.040 --> 00:38.560]  It's Monday August 15th 2022 we have an extremely powerful informative transmission
[00:39.200 --> 00:46.800]  lined up for you today but I come to you the info wars listeners and viewers with the most intense
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.480]  dire information not just for the future of info wars but for the future of free speech
[00:54.480 --> 01:01.280]  in america and across the world if we don't have free speech and if we don't have independent
[01:01.280 --> 01:07.040]  media outlets to counter the great reset globalist onslaught we have very little hope
[01:08.080 --> 01:14.320]  but if we can stay on air at this critical time while the globalists are launching their major
[01:14.320 --> 01:19.760]  offensive their operations will backfire on them and it will accelerate the great awakening and
[01:19.760 --> 01:25.440]  they will be defeated easily that's why your tireless work keeping info wars on the air has been
[01:25.440 --> 01:33.040]  beyond critical the enemies of freedom recognize info wars as the cultural and political and and
[01:33.040 --> 01:42.240]  spiritual vanguard of a pro-human future in an anti-transhumanist system ladies and gentlemen
[01:42.240 --> 01:49.520]  there was an article in Reuters that came out this morning that told us that our suspicions
[01:50.560 --> 01:55.920]  and the information we had was dead on about the first of three show trials that was held
[01:55.920 --> 02:03.040]  two weeks ago in austin texas ladies and gentlemen they have now talked to the jury
[02:03.040 --> 02:14.240]  and the jury has now confirmed what we knew they were not going to give them any more money after
[02:14.240 --> 02:21.760]  the five plus million dollar judgment in the first part of actual damages because they didn't have a
[02:21.760 --> 02:30.560]  formula to decide when the judge told them that i was already guilty that they could use to decide
[02:30.560 --> 02:34.880]  how much money to give them and you read what the jury had to say they're like well he was already
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.880]  guilty the judge said so so they bought that incredibly dangerous precedent but we didn't
[02:40.880 --> 02:46.080]  have a formula and they didn't believe the formula that the plaintiff's lawyers gave them of one
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.520]  dollar for every american that i told the lie that sainthood didn't happen to but then when
[02:51.520 --> 03:00.960]  in this so-called economist bernard francis pettengill jr who behaved and acted just like
[03:00.960 --> 03:06.960]  thurston howell from gilligan's island when that guy got up there with all our financials
[03:08.080 --> 03:12.800]  that they said we hadn't given them so we were defaulted and twisted it around
[03:12.800 --> 03:20.400]  they believe that i am worth two hundred and sixty million dollars so the jury said
[03:22.640 --> 03:28.320]  in the reuters article they decided to give ten percent of my net worth to each parent
[03:29.920 --> 03:36.880]  heslin and lewis the divorcee who lost their son ladies and gentlemen this is so insane
[03:36.880 --> 03:44.160]  the judge would not let us even though we'd already given them our net worth bring that forward and
[03:44.160 --> 03:50.080]  she knew exactly what she was doing this is judicial fraud this is criminal in my view
[03:50.640 --> 03:54.320]  and it's outrageous and it gets worse we're going to lay all this out when we come back
[03:54.320 --> 03:57.920]  and we're going to shift gears and all the other news but we now have crystal clear
[03:58.960 --> 04:03.920]  evidence here of exactly what happened i'm going to go through it line by line and give you the
[04:03.920 --> 04:11.840]  facts imagine a judge knowing that someone doesn't have two million dollars in cash and that their
[04:11.840 --> 04:17.360]  net worth is maybe six seven million dollars and that our debts are bigger than that so i'm actually
[04:17.360 --> 04:26.000]  in negative territory to then have that information hold it back and let a so-called expert come in
[04:26.000 --> 04:30.160]  who's got our documents but twist them around so there's our evidence but we can't actually
[04:30.160 --> 04:35.440]  show you what's really in the evidence and then let the other side get up and tell the jury
[04:36.240 --> 04:40.400]  that jones isn't speaking and his lawyers aren't speaking during this phase of the trial the last
[04:40.400 --> 04:47.920]  day because they didn't give any evidence because they don't have any evidence and then they show
[04:47.920 --> 04:54.320]  twisted financials we gave them this is absolutely unprecedented ladies and gentlemen we'll be
[04:54.320 --> 05:04.240]  right back on the other side of info wars tomorrow's news today sold out for more than a year and a

[06:05.920 --> 06:14.400]  he is patient zero for alternative facts is there's going to be a large set of plaintiffs
[06:14.400 --> 06:20.480]  who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy estate take him out of this
[06:20.480 --> 06:28.320]  discourse of this misinformation of this peddling of lies and make sure he can't do it again
[06:33.520 --> 06:39.200]  it's monday august 15th the year is 2022 i'm Alex Jones your host i want to thank you all for
[06:39.200 --> 06:46.400]  joining us today i have some extremely serious news to lay out for you right now and i wanted
[06:46.400 --> 06:51.280]  to really sink into everybody that every major globalist media outlet from bloomberg to the
[06:51.280 --> 06:58.800]  new york times to cnn are openly saying that these lawsuits against info wars are now going to be
[06:58.800 --> 07:03.920]  used against fox news against tucker carlson and against all the other conservative publications
[07:03.920 --> 07:08.880]  and operations that are left they have to take out the opposition to the new world order to succeed
[07:08.880 --> 07:14.560]  because what they're doing is unpopular it's destructive and it is criminal we have had a
[07:14.560 --> 07:20.640]  major breakthrough and a huge development has now come out in Reuters and it confirmed the
[07:20.640 --> 07:26.720]  information that we already had we have their blueprint we understand how the fraud works and
[07:26.720 --> 07:33.200]  we're going to expose it right now as you know a week and a half ago the big show trial the first
[07:33.200 --> 07:39.360]  of three ended in austin texas the judge had already said i was guilty the same judge in a
[07:39.360 --> 07:44.400]  few months has me before her again with another kangaroo operation they have a connecticut
[07:44.400 --> 07:52.320]  system where i've been defaulted it's all coordinated she would not let us have a witness or testify
[07:52.320 --> 07:59.520]  the final day unprecedented and talk about our net worth instead using our documents we gave them
[07:59.520 --> 08:06.640]  but twisted they put bernard frances pettengill a so-called economist up there on the stand
[08:08.000 --> 08:14.640]  to claim that i'm worth 260 million dollars at least when ladies and gentlemen if you look at
[08:14.640 --> 08:21.440]  our debts and operations and my personal life we are in the hole we filed for bankruptcy free speech
[08:21.440 --> 08:28.800]  systems and in the very near future i am going to be publishing my actual finances to the world
[08:28.800 --> 08:33.040]  so that when the corporate media and the courts lie and say that i have hundreds of millions of
[08:33.040 --> 08:38.400]  dollars it will be a known quantifiable fraud i have to do this because they continue to lie
[08:39.200 --> 08:44.000]  and not let us show these juries as information they tell them we're guilty and they decide now
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.960]  it's time for you to decide what percentage of his net worth should be given when they know full
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.680]  damn well that we are on the rocks and could easily be shut down so here is their blueprint ladies
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.160]  and gentlemen info wars and the most dire straits but so is america the using law fair and the
[09:00.160 --> 09:03.840]  weapon i should just share as you're seeing with trump and everybody else against the people
[09:04.480 --> 09:12.960]  here's the big article from roiders exclusive inside the alex jones jury room tensions pizza
[09:12.960 --> 09:19.280]  and lizard people and it goes on to say that a large part of the jury only thought there should be
[09:19.280 --> 09:26.560]  five hundred thousand dollars given to them but some of the jury thought two hundred million we
[09:26.560 --> 09:30.400]  saw those numbers on the board someone said well i guess we're never leaving this room because they
[09:30.400 --> 09:37.440]  couldn't agree and it goes on until we couldn't testify and they put this so-called economist up
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.040]  who looked right at them and said he's got two hundred and sixty million dollars
[09:41.040 --> 09:49.200]  this is page two this is key because the judge overseeing the case had in september already
[09:49.200 --> 09:54.320]  found jones liable for defamation and intentional emotional stress for claiming the 20 children
[09:54.320 --> 09:59.840]  hadn't died so again she found me guilty they went along with it said okay he's guilty and
[09:59.840 --> 10:05.280]  i tell us how much money he's got the plaintiff's lawyers had asked for 150 million the previous
[10:05.280 --> 10:11.360]  day and actual damages had given 4.1 million this was now the punishment phase at first some
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.840]  jurors were skeptical that haslan and lewis were entitled to any compensatory damages at all it goes
[10:15.840 --> 10:24.960]  on to say but then then pettingill rides over the hill jurors didn't give much credence to the parents
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.680]  lawyers request for one dollar for every one of the 24 percent of americans who gouted nobly
[10:29.680 --> 10:35.600]  sandy hook see i gotta pay for every person in some poll they admit was fake they went on and
[10:35.600 --> 10:42.000]  saw 150 million the jurors didn't buy that instead they calculated off of pettingill the damages
[10:42.000 --> 10:46.800]  based on their own formulas and by the end of the afternoon the room resembled a math classroom
[10:46.800 --> 10:53.920]  a math classroom based on fake data my net worth is less than 10 million dollars my debt is over
[10:53.920 --> 11:00.880]  50 million dollars continuing ladies and gentlemen so negative eventually they arrived at four
[11:00.880 --> 11:07.920]  point million a compensatory now here's the biggest key part sharon said jurors decided to award punitive
[11:07.920 --> 11:16.880]  damages worth 10 of jones's net worth per parent jones is worth 130 million and 270 million a
[11:16.880 --> 11:22.320]  plaintiff's expert testified so i'm sorry it's more than 270 it's 270 i said 260 i was remembering
[11:22.320 --> 11:27.760]  270 he made up and pulled out of his rear end and 130 million so i'm worth 130 million and free
[11:27.760 --> 11:34.240]  speakers were 270 million so now we're up there at uh 400 million okay so 400 million dollars
[11:35.280 --> 11:40.400]  sharon said jurors decided to award punitive damages were 10 of jones's net worth per parent
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.680]  jones's worth 130 million and 270 million a plaintiff's expert testified the jurors punitive
[11:45.680 --> 11:52.960]  damages verdict was 45.2 million or 10 for each parent 45 plus million if you count the cash i've
[11:52.960 --> 12:01.440]  got in my house and all the rest of it is what is that 10 times i mean this is incredible the award
[12:01.440 --> 12:05.600]  could wind up being slashed by the judge to as little as 10 percent now that's state law but
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.760]  she'll probably ignore that free speech systems file for bankruptcy in texas midway through the
[12:09.760 --> 12:14.480]  trial a group of sainthood parents you mean the lawyers interviewed the case had asked a judge
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.920]  to freeze the company's assets to prevent jones from funneling cash to different entities we're
[12:19.920 --> 12:27.120]  in federal bankruptcy and they're calling for us to not be able to even run operations and just
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.560]  whatever money's left for payroll and to buy products and just be given to them but you think
[12:32.560 --> 12:36.480]  they want to get these big damages and be paid out of the money you know they want the golden goose
[12:36.480 --> 12:42.400]  dead because again take him out take his bullhorn away take his platform silence him
[12:42.400 --> 12:48.000]  him that's what the democratic party in the deep state one that's what they admit they've done
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.720]  and the jury's well he's guilty the judge says and he's worth 400 million dollars and so we're
[12:52.720 --> 12:58.960]  going to give you 40 something million dollars all based on a lie all based on bs and the judge
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.960]  knew and the judge let them say the plaintiffs lawyers to them mr. jones didn't testify today
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.120]  and he didn't have an expert because he knows what we're saying is true he doesn't have any evidence
[13:09.120 --> 13:16.000]  and then they twisted all these financials to show false numbers they take 60 something million
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.320]  dollars over the years to buy supplements and call that money i kept and say it's a money laundering
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.880]  operation because it was given to a supplement company about product this is the games they play
[13:24.880 --> 13:30.320]  and this is who these people are they're coming for you and your family we're going to play a
[13:30.320 --> 13:35.680]  clip of them again admitting they want to chop up our corpse and feed on it cannibalistically
[13:35.680 --> 13:43.120]  of info wars in a metaphysical archetypal analogy but first i just want to remind you

[15:09.280 --> 15:13.120]  of plaintiffs who are going to be dividing up the corpse of info wars in the bankruptcy
[15:13.120 --> 15:17.280]  estate and over the course of that process that could get very very dangerous for mr

[19:38.960 --> 19:43.520]  I mean look at the hair and beard support formula folks this is a joke I mean we're giving this
[19:43.520 --> 19:49.040]  thing away it's 75% off by the way it works for me in case you haven't noticed the hair and beard
[19:49.040 --> 19:57.440]  formula is working for me quite well I might add quite well my barber appreciates hair and beard
[19:57.440 --> 20:04.080]  support for Ben I go and see him quite often now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[20:04.080 --> 20:18.640]  world order it's Alex Jones waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[20:18.640 --> 20:27.600]  front lines of the info war and we are back here on this Monday live edition of the Alex Jones show
[20:27.600 --> 20:32.160]  this is a very special edition of the broadcast because we don't normally make the main focus
[20:32.160 --> 20:38.160]  of what we cover info wars but info wars is at the very heart of the globalist program to
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.800]  silence the people of America in the world and so I want to open the phones up today on a wide
[20:42.800 --> 20:51.040]  range of issues that are under the umbrella of free speech and and how do we keep the globalists
[20:51.040 --> 20:56.800]  from silencing the people so when I give the number out I'd like to hear callers views and
[20:56.800 --> 21:02.800]  perspectives on what would America and the world be like if info wars was taken off the
[21:02.800 --> 21:08.400]  air and if we weren't reaching five six seven eight nine sometimes 10 million people a day
[21:08.960 --> 21:13.360]  despite all of the intense censorship in fact sometimes thanks to all your support we reach
[21:13.360 --> 21:18.640]  more than that so I'm going to give the number out specifically for listeners to call in and
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.200]  no insurers are about to be taking over I'll be back doing the full show tomorrow asking the question
[21:23.200 --> 21:29.040]  what would the world be like with info wars what will the world be like if this AI merger
[21:30.080 --> 21:36.880]  with humans censoring people in pre-crime before they can even post online what effect will that
[21:36.880 --> 21:41.840]  have and how do we stop them that's a giant area to discuss we're also going to open the phones
[21:41.840 --> 21:47.520]  up about the persecution of Trump these so-called nuked secrets and where you think the deep state's
[21:47.520 --> 21:53.280]  going to go next they're openly fomenting civil war they're claiming Trump supporters are about to
[21:53.280 --> 21:59.600]  engage in all this terror Trump reportedly sent the attorney general garland a message saying hey
[21:59.600 --> 22:05.040]  people are really mad the temperatures high what can I do to help lower the temperature which Trump's
[22:05.040 --> 22:11.520]  been trying to do and the media called that a veiled threat at garland these people are out of
[22:11.520 --> 22:16.640]  control they're disconnected from reality there's been a major political realignment people don't
[22:16.640 --> 22:20.960]  want to be under their control anymore and they're losing more and more hearts and minds every day
[22:20.960 --> 22:27.360]  so like tyrants in history they doubled down when they start losing when hitler was losing the
[22:27.360 --> 22:35.680]  attack on england and on north africa what did he do he invaded poland he invaded a bunch of other
[22:35.680 --> 22:43.280]  countries what happened when he started losing those wars he then invaded russia in fact the
[22:43.280 --> 22:48.640]  actual order of it goes first he invaded poland then he invaded some other areas france then he
[22:48.640 --> 22:53.840]  started attacking england losing that losing the north african conflict and then he went into russia
[22:53.840 --> 23:01.600]  but but the point is is that that's what megalomaniacs do and they double down even though it's going
[23:01.600 --> 23:08.000]  to ensure they're destroyed because they subconsciously want to take everyone with them and so
[23:08.560 --> 23:12.080]  that's what we're facing and dealing with here and i want to have a larger debate about how we
[23:12.080 --> 23:18.080]  stop civil war how we stop violence and how we continue our nonviolent cultural revolution of
[23:18.080 --> 23:22.560]  freedom and liberty against their globalist revolution of transhumanism and corporate
[23:22.560 --> 23:27.760]  run communism the toll-free number to join us is eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three
[23:27.760 --> 23:33.280]  nine eight seven seven seven eight nine alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three
[23:33.280 --> 23:38.240]  nine and we're doing first time callers for the first 20 calls of the board that after those 20
[23:38.240 --> 23:42.320]  calls have been taken we're going to move to the next folks and and oh it's going to do a great job
[23:43.200 --> 23:48.560]  just bam bam bam giving each person 60 seconds and then moving on to the next person so you
[23:48.560 --> 23:52.640]  won't be sitting on hold a long time we've been a lot better but actually going to your calls and
[23:52.640 --> 23:56.480]  actually taking them bam bam bam but we're going to dispense with the pleasantries we all love
[23:56.480 --> 24:01.040]  each other and just like rush limo you should say just say ditto and we know what that means
[24:01.040 --> 24:06.160]  now if you disagree and hate us by all means call in we'd love to hear why we're the bad guys and
[24:06.160 --> 24:11.760]  we're the establishment and i'm lex luther and you know we're we're we're the insiders no we're not
[24:11.760 --> 24:17.200]  we are the rebels and we are fighting the globalist at point like range now some of the other news on
[24:17.200 --> 24:23.600]  info wars dot com that we're dealing with is the first dog has monkeypox there's been no deaths
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.440]  in the u.s for monkeypox we're told we need new lockdowns new mask new controls but now a dog
[24:29.440 --> 24:33.920]  has it and it's being reported by the local news not not the national news that the dog had been
[24:33.920 --> 24:40.640]  anally raped and it had anal monkeypox so uh that's what happens in these cultures folks is they
[24:40.640 --> 24:45.920]  just get more and more decadent more more out of control and that's why the fetish of the left now
[24:45.920 --> 24:54.160]  is the lgbtpq ppp which is for pedophilia very very serious situation also twitter is now banning
[24:54.160 --> 25:00.080]  a bunch of women that are complaining about big giant men with shaved heads twice their size beating
[25:00.080 --> 25:04.880]  them up in rugby used to beating up a girl was the worst thing you could do other than
[25:04.880 --> 25:10.560]  i guess raping children but the left is all about sex with children forcibly sex changing children
[25:11.360 --> 25:19.120]  brainwashing them men in mma beating up women i mean this is just psychotic evil continuing
[25:19.920 --> 25:26.400]  we're also going to be looking more at what you think the next shoot a drop is with msnbc and others
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.600]  have their new hoax their new talking point that well trump was a russian agent or trump
[25:31.600 --> 25:35.600]  tried to steal the election or trump stole the first election all these other lies they've told
[25:35.600 --> 25:41.280]  that we now know were frauds well now again they're saying he's selling newt secrets to the russians
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.160]  and the chinese all a bit of fraud all of it a lie as we get deeper and deeper into this
[25:46.160 --> 25:54.240]  orwellian world so 8777892539 we're going to be taking your phone calls today i'm also shooting
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.280]  some reports on the street before i come back to austin texas this afternoon that you'll see
[25:59.280 --> 26:05.360]  later on in the broadcast but from the earlier subject of the weaponization of the judiciary
[26:05.360 --> 26:10.240]  telling the jury i was already guilty letting fake evidence be put on that i have 400 million
[26:10.240 --> 26:17.200]  dollars and all this other garbage we need to have a larger discussion about this because again
[26:17.200 --> 26:21.920]  this is the blueprint they're going to use against everybody else now we're going to go to break here
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.520]  in just a few minutes and when we come back we're going to continue
[26:27.840 --> 26:33.440]  with the breaking news and with your phone calls because i know oan has a lot of news and a lot of

[27:20.480 --> 27:26.080]  two of them are mrna the other two operate on a virus vector system but they go in and program
[27:26.080 --> 27:31.520]  the body to create these deadly spike proteins it is so huge that the insurance companies have
[27:31.520 --> 27:36.480]  confirmed what broke a year ago when a big german insurance company first reported it now u.s
[27:36.480 --> 27:39.680]  insurance companies multinational insurance companies somebody's the biggest insurance
[27:39.680 --> 27:44.480]  companies out there that there is a massive increase in death but you can also go to any

[27:49.680 --> 27:56.880]  a 40 to 50 times increase in the normal number of people they're bearing at those cemeteries did

[28:15.840 --> 28:20.800]  percentage above the average a few percentage below the average many years the average stays the same

[38:29.520 --> 38:37.440]  and we are going to start with mike right here in texas mike you're on the alex jones show go ahead
[38:37.440 --> 38:47.040]  yeah hi owen uh i was there that friday after the after this case in austin wrapped up and the
[38:47.600 --> 38:51.040]  the attorneys were coming out the the front door of the courthouse
[38:52.480 --> 39:01.840]  in that heat and humidity that only sell texas can can provide and i heard first was alex's
[39:01.840 --> 39:09.120]  lead attorney he came out and told the interviewer that uh yeah we're pleased with the way this
[39:09.680 --> 39:17.840]  case went and i was stunned and i uh i didn't want to harass him while he was being interviewed
[39:17.840 --> 39:27.200]  but as he and his colleague left i said you're pleased with a 40 million dollar award are you
[39:27.200 --> 39:33.920]  nuts and he just looked at looked back at me with a sardonic smile and walked on uh but then i uh i
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.880]  stayed on for the uh for the knuckle draggers the the clowns who were destroying the legal system
[39:40.880 --> 39:51.200]  to get at alex and uh i know alex knows the sound of my voice i'm a retired doc i uh i don't often
[39:51.200 --> 39:59.280]  get uh uh the impulse to pound someone's head into sand but uh i i really wanted to go after
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.360]  these there about four four guys including the the lead schmucked on the other side with some
[40:05.360 --> 40:11.120]  attractive young lady uh who was saying i i just don't understand how these people can be so callous
[40:11.120 --> 40:21.600]  i was holding up the uh a hand-drawn sign that said uh uh more more people uh uh how did i put
[40:21.600 --> 40:29.040]  that uh but it it doesn't matter it was it was questioning uh sandy hook the the truth of the
[40:29.040 --> 40:37.440]  story and uh you know they looked at me with utter contempt as i looked at them um well look they
[40:37.440 --> 40:42.080]  they flaunted their true agenda in their closing statements they said this is all about shutting
[40:42.080 --> 40:46.480]  down alex jones and destroying alex jones and making sure that alex jones cannot exist anymore
[40:46.480 --> 40:52.320]  and that info wars goes away and nobody ever thinks about uh starting a free speech alternative news
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.560]  platform ever again i mean they just said that to the jury in their final statement and i mean i
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.600]  guess the jury bought it and you know the funny thing about that is and i mean look i i'm not
[41:03.600 --> 41:08.320]  going to speak for the lawyer they were trying to get 300 million dollars they tried to claim
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.920]  that the value of info wars was a billion dollars during the lawsuit i mean folks the lies that these
[41:15.920 --> 41:21.680]  attorneys tell are just earth shattering and it's like you're just sitting here getting gaslit and
[41:21.680 --> 41:26.640]  then they just tell you the whole agenda to shut it down but they wanted to get 300 million dollars
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.480]  they're not going to get the 40 is probably going to get capped because of the texas law i don't
[41:30.480 --> 41:36.160]  know what the final number will be so it might be like 5 million it might be survivable um they got
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.400]  more lawsuits coming to try to do the exact same thing and it's and it's really about whatever they
[41:40.400 --> 41:45.280]  can do to us financially is is one angle it's really just about tarring and felt feathering alex
[41:45.280 --> 41:52.880]  jones uh for the public to see to scare others off from questioning mainstream media government
[41:52.880 --> 41:59.920]  narratives um i stayed there i stayed on a couple hours to to talk to this lady who said her name's
[41:59.920 --> 42:06.160]  kim she said she was a neighbor of uh of alex's mother and i had no reason to doubt that but
[42:06.160 --> 42:12.160]  we were both puzzle why there weren't uh more supporters out there um well look we didn't
[42:12.160 --> 42:19.920]  want to well let me i'll i'll tell you why you think us publicizing where that case was would be
[42:19.920 --> 42:25.040]  good headlines when they already try to claim make false claims like we're sending people after people
[42:25.040 --> 42:30.240]  which never happened so yeah inviting a bunch of people to show up outside of the courtroom to
[42:30.240 --> 42:34.160]  support us probably they would use that against us in court but you know i was going to say this
[42:34.160 --> 42:39.600]  and mike thanks for the call they added up the totals of the jury at the end of it and i meant
[42:39.600 --> 42:45.840]  to ask a lawyer about this but so they added it up a couple of the jurors said zero dollars so what
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.440]  if what if 11 of the 12 jurors said zero dollars but one said 300 million dollars and then they
[42:51.440 --> 42:56.480]  would have gotten that 300 million dollar number that doesn't really seem right a lot of a lot of
[42:56.480 --> 43:03.280]  chicanery going down in that courtroom so many people over the years have walked up to me randomly
[43:03.280 --> 43:09.200]  on the street and said super male vitality is incredible why does it work so well and the
[43:09.200 --> 43:15.520]  answer is very simple it takes from chinese medicine and other ancient traditions known herbal
[43:15.520 --> 43:22.240]  compounds that boosts libido, stamina and energy and it comes from cold pressed herbs so they're
[43:22.240 --> 43:29.600]  not boiling or heating up the herbs that are known to have these natural effects it's cold pressed

[45:06.800 --> 45:11.680]  money magazine have all done these profiles you see it every year 30 different tax returns 30
[45:11.680 --> 45:17.600]  different answers 50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[45:17.600 --> 45:22.240]  screw you over especially the big firms and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[45:22.240 --> 45:27.040]  and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this so it's a very important
[45:27.040 --> 45:33.520]  situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody to be able to do things
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.840]  tax wise it's legal and lawful that allows you to keep more your money we wouldn't even be here
[45:37.840 --> 45:44.320]  if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years the only way you fail is not

[47:24.000 --> 47:31.520]  decision with that final number in the punitive judges uh the judgment against alex jones and
[47:31.520 --> 47:38.880]  info wars and it just so happens robert barnes is going to be joining me now at one o'clock
[47:39.840 --> 47:44.160]  so i'll ask him that we'll get into the latest on the marlago raid and other developments
[47:44.720 --> 47:50.400]  but let's go back to the phone lines now and we've got craig in ohio craig you're on the alex
[47:50.400 --> 47:59.680]  jones show go ahead hello elin hi hey um hey first off i just i really come to appreciate your
[47:59.680 --> 48:05.200]  analysis um you know i obviously started watching with alex and thank you and heresy you guys have
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.840]  done a great job and i the biggest thing is i'm glad you guys haven't completely dove in on the
[48:09.840 --> 48:15.040]  marlago thing if you keep covering other stuff because sometimes i think that stuff a lot of
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.360]  times of diversion you know just to take our focus off of stuff so i think well there's no
[48:19.360 --> 48:24.400]  doubt the marlago raid took focus off a lot of things that develop like the cdc saying that
[48:24.400 --> 48:29.440]  covet is the flu the fbi still refusing to turn over hunter biden's laptop they're they're they're
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.080]  past their due date on that uh and there was there was a lot of other stuff the border there's
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.120]  like a cartel war going on at the border right now uh so there's all kinds of crazy stuff but
[48:39.120 --> 48:43.200]  having said that i mean the marlago raid was obviously a very dangerous precedent setting
[48:43.200 --> 48:50.880]  event uh in a historical event in our country's history but there's also for for me when i see
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.000]  all the other mainstream media covering an event and fox news nightly covering the marlago raid
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.200]  with with the best coverage i've seen on fox news like ever that takes the pressure off that's
[49:01.200 --> 49:05.920]  like a big pressure reliever that we don't have to show up and and and score the touchdown on that
[49:05.920 --> 49:12.000]  coverage because others are yeah i mean every night on fox news someone's calling to dismantle
[49:12.000 --> 49:19.440]  the fbi and it's just like wow talk about a pressure reliever yeah it's good to see you know and i
[49:19.440 --> 49:24.080]  think like you said and i think most people agree i think you guys have been driving that it's good
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.600]  to see it you know dripping over to the other news outlets and whether we're driving it or not
[49:29.600 --> 49:35.040]  people are catching up we'll put it that way yep so i've got a quick thing here so you know i mean
[49:35.040 --> 49:43.440]  i've been watching economy type stuff for 30 years and 30 plus years and um the what there's always
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.240]  a theme to this stuff right there's always a money and then there's a cover up right it's always a
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.640]  case we could go back to jekyll island we could you know we could go through all that stuff right
[49:52.640 --> 49:58.880]  which you guys have covered through time very well i think we're in the same thing here right i don't
[49:58.880 --> 50:04.640]  know how good that this scam is right the novel parari and you know these what do you guys say
[50:04.640 --> 50:09.120]  they have all this stuff i'm not convinced they have it all sometimes i think they use that to
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.920]  sell to their corporate buddies that we've got it all under control get on board with us you know that
[50:13.920 --> 50:20.160]  kind of stuff well it's like have you ever seen um well okay let's or let's use the bug's life
[50:20.160 --> 50:26.800]  analogy with the grasshoppers they have the illusion of control but as soon as the people decide to
[50:26.800 --> 50:33.440]  stand up for themselves their control is gone right i think that's great here's the thing though as
[50:33.440 --> 50:39.360]  i don't think that we right as the other side right as the people you know if we look at any
[50:39.360 --> 50:44.720]  war through history right we always have the ability to win it if we just could get together
[50:44.720 --> 50:49.920]  you know if we could just unite right these they have no chance but what i don't think we're doing
[50:49.920 --> 50:55.360]  right i'm not doing you guys are doing because we're not like calling people out like who are
[50:55.360 --> 51:02.160]  they right you know is it is it you know um you know i mean we threw out the name bill you know bill
[51:02.160 --> 51:06.640]  games and other well here's been the problem over the years craig and and i think that we
[51:06.640 --> 51:10.480]  mean we talk about claus schwaab you talk about you just called in about harari you just mentioned
[51:10.480 --> 51:16.080]  bill gates i mean we obviously know who's corrupt in our government now covid really removed the
[51:16.080 --> 51:24.160]  veil of a lot of i would say covid and trump removed the veil of a lot of deep state operations and
[51:24.160 --> 51:30.560]  a lot of deep state operatives i mean they have peter stroke going on msnbc over the weekend talking
[51:30.560 --> 51:37.920]  about the integrity of the fbi peter stroke like that's his real name and so i mean i i think we are
[51:37.920 --> 51:41.920]  starting to realize who the bad guys are i mean there's obviously going to be the the men in the
[51:41.920 --> 51:46.960]  shadows but uh i think we do know who's pulling the strings i think we do know about the world
[51:46.960 --> 51:53.520]  economic forum i think we do know about the bill deberg group uh so i i i mean claus schwaab and
[51:53.520 --> 51:57.280]  these people come out and say we need to be prepared for an angry world and now we're seeing it
[51:57.280 --> 52:03.840]  we're seeing uprisings all across the planet we're so good here in the us we've got it so good off
[52:03.840 --> 52:09.280]  that we haven't had to have violent uprisings because people are so starved out uh with with
[52:09.280 --> 52:15.280]  no hope for the future but a lot of countries around the world are at that breaking point
[52:15.920 --> 52:21.600]  and it's because they introduced the world economic forum green politics policies and now
[52:21.600 --> 52:27.440]  they have no energy they have no gas they have no coal and um they're just they're just violent uprisings
[52:27.440 --> 52:31.760]  they're shutting down farmers farmers are rising up all over too uh craig thank you for the call
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.600]  let's go to jonathan in florida jonathan you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[52:39.120 --> 52:44.480]  part of say that this is very scary what's happening here and uh these these stateness
[52:44.480 --> 52:51.280]  these globalists they're hiding behind trans people and green energy because these are things that
[52:51.280 --> 52:55.360]  they can if somebody goes against these things it's very easy for them to call them a bigot
[52:55.360 --> 53:00.320]  and it's very easy for them to say oh you just don't care about the planet so they have this sort of a
[53:00.960 --> 53:05.680]  virtue is sort of on their side but not really yeah that's what they i i i don't know if there's
[53:05.680 --> 53:10.320]  an act really a word for that phenomenon or propaganda but it's the same thing they do with
[53:10.320 --> 53:14.400]  like oh we're black lives matter well if you criticize that you're racist well it's nothing to
[53:14.400 --> 53:18.800]  do with black people they just they just use black people as a mask as a front it's like
[53:18.800 --> 53:24.320]  corporate blackface or political blackface to run their to ram their agenda through without any
[53:24.320 --> 53:29.920]  buddy stepping up to them yep they prop up an enemy and then hide behind the opposition to that
[53:29.920 --> 53:36.320]  propped up enemy so that that is the psychology behind them and they also have the resentful
[53:36.320 --> 53:41.600]  people just you know regular resentful people because even not see germany and cuba and all these
[53:41.600 --> 53:48.640]  uh socialist uh agendas have all been propagated by resentment for rich people because most people
[53:48.640 --> 53:53.600]  let's face it are lazy and don't want to work so they also have the majority of people under the
[53:53.600 --> 54:00.720]  belt that fit into that category and and i wish that you could get the average low low level
[54:01.360 --> 54:05.920]  communists understand this all communism does is just increase the difference between the
[54:05.920 --> 54:10.720]  haves and the have nots and so that's that that's really what we're seeing more than anything right
[54:10.720 --> 54:15.280]  now is just the gap between the haves and the have nots is widening and they don't care because
[54:15.280 --> 54:20.960]  they promise they they they think that anybody that that success or anything is this evil and
[54:20.960 --> 54:25.600]  they don't they don't care a lot of it is sadistic they want to see america fall they want to
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.080]  absolutely suffer they love watching trump go through this they love watching alex jones go
[54:30.080 --> 54:34.800]  through this they love torturing anybody that has any sense of god and truth in them
[54:36.880 --> 54:42.800]  yeah just look at how they dance and parade around and celebrate like like uh heathens
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.520]  when they tear down a statue of you know thomas jefferson or something
[54:48.400 --> 54:51.680]  thank you thank you so much all right thank you for the call remember they they
[54:52.560 --> 54:56.640]  they tore down that statue i forget where it was we probably find the footage that toppled
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.560]  and it landed on a guy and busted his skull wide open i don't know if he survived that he was in a
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.360]  coma for like a year i think i mean you can see like the thing topples on his head and like a
[55:07.360 --> 55:20.000]  fragment of his skull is exposed that's like barbaric heathens in in in a deranged psychotic
[55:20.960 --> 55:29.360]  mass mental illness ritual it's like oh my gosh we're taking down this inanimate object because
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.720]  we're told to hate it's been there for decades like oh now we want to take it down and then
[55:34.720 --> 55:38.240]  they're all hopping up and down ah and then get the statue down and then
[55:39.520 --> 55:48.560]  smashes a guy right in the head like you're out of control you are out of control
[55:50.320 --> 55:55.440]  let's go to flash in south carolina flash yeah there there it is right there i think it was
[55:55.440 --> 56:01.040]  maybe in new warlands i don't remember but yeah they take it down topples a guy and uh i think
[56:01.040 --> 56:07.520]  it i think it i think it killed him boom and look they all just kind of stand around like oh my
[56:07.520 --> 56:13.120]  gosh oh what have we done what have we done well you you're out of control you've you've had a
[56:13.120 --> 56:19.520]  psychotic break uh flash go ahead oh i didn't know if you could hear me hey no sorry i kept talking

[56:25.760 --> 56:33.440]  it was really strange um the reason i'm calling in it has to do with the censorship and until
[56:33.440 --> 56:39.360]  people have a way to communicate with each other and do it without being obstructed this problem
[56:39.360 --> 56:44.320]  we're having is not going to end now for a good while i've been working on something that i'm
[56:44.320 --> 56:50.480]  calling the patriot phone book it can be for liberal conservative it doesn't matter what your
[56:50.480 --> 56:57.280]  political views are it allows people to go in and they can leave email addresses they can
[56:57.280 --> 57:03.280]  grab email addresses from people from state by state where they're at and what this will allow
[57:03.280 --> 57:11.280]  them to do this will allow them to form uh basically just little chapters with each other
[57:11.280 --> 57:17.840]  they're outside media so other words that uh they can't be shut off by youtube or something like that
[57:17.840 --> 57:23.840]  and um well this is just so great to hear because i mean i get guests on about this
[57:24.400 --> 57:30.560]  so many americans are are are hearing the the call of paul revere now and they're doing what you're
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.720]  doing they're building uh you know contact lists they're building different social media platforms

[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:26.560]  got john in wisconsin twice on the board back to back but one just called in so if you're the john
[1:02:26.560 --> 1:02:29.840]  that hasn't been on hold that long i'm going to the john that's been on hold for half an hour
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:36.400]  so john in wisconsin one of the two johns in wisconsin here man i'm this is wild all right
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:42.720]  john in wisconsin one go hey how you doing man uh i don't know why i'm on there twice but can you
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:47.200]  hear me well you're you're you're multi-dimensional today you're calling in from multiple dimensions
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:52.400]  i called a couple times and i hung up and got through so so to be on the line here long time
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:58.080]  listener big fan um today i just i wanted to talk to you a little bit about uh my theory on
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:05.760]  q and on and how it's being used to silence free speech and how um my interpretation of it i followed
[1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:10.160]  it but i wasn't a believer in it i just i love analyzing conspiracy theories i think they're
[1:03:10.160 --> 1:03:16.720]  fascinating and so um my ultimate conclusion on it was that it was actually a left wing
[1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:25.440]  lark and i don't know if you remember the qism was was it all for a lark and yeah i think it was
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:31.440]  it was a left wing lark and that's where the deception lies so um well no you say left wing
[1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:37.920]  lark i mean i you think it was some a democrat or a liberal like running it like as a as a joke
[1:03:39.520 --> 1:03:45.360]  that i mean i'm running it by you but that's what i've come to believe so i i think well i don't
[1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:51.520]  think here's what i i i i don't know what the true origins originally of q and on were and there
[1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:56.560]  were people that are pretty big in media i won't name names but they're very influential and big
[1:03:56.560 --> 1:04:01.040]  followings in media that when q first started they told me how they knew q and they knew q was the
[1:04:01.040 --> 1:04:03.920]  real deal and so i don't know if they were lying to me or maybe there was some good people that
[1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:11.600]  were q but at the end of the day q was i believe a probably fbi or something running q at the end
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:15.760]  of the day they commandeered it if it was ever legitimate they took it over and then it was a
[1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:22.480]  total psi op used to set people up on january 6th 100 percent 100 percent so that's i mean that's
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:27.360]  what i wanted to say is that i i believe that it was actually created as the controlled opposition
[1:04:27.360 --> 1:04:31.920]  yeah for the great reason because why are they not here's and here's the proof right here the
[1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:38.640]  proof is in the pudding as they say how come the january 6 committee or the fbi or anybody talking
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:43.600]  about january 6 how come not a single one of them has brought up q and on now they brought up q and
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:48.400]  on all the time leading up to the election they would they would say q and on this q and on that
[1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:53.520]  now that they're doing their investigations into january 6 they won't even mention q and on that's
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:05:03.440]  clearly the giveaway right there so many people over the years have walked up to me randomly on

[1:06:21.840 --> 1:06:31.040]  taken four covid vaccines four that's four more than you so i'm obviously better than you i have
[1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:42.560]  four covid vaccines say the line say the line i have tested positive for covid 19 but because
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:53.440]  of my vaccination status i am only suffering from low to mild symptoms if i hadn't gotten my four
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:07:02.240]  injections certainly right now i would be dead like everyone we said would be dead that didn't
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:11.760]  take the vaccine but now everyone that takes the vaccine is getting sick of course the cdc just
[1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:21.520]  admitted that covid is basically the flu we still gotta have a press release statement he's got covid
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:29.680]  all right he's sick have a have a cup of chicken soup take a rest you'll be fine but hey that vaccine
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:35.360]  guys that vaccine hey you know they were giving away free vaccines this weekend i was tempted to get
[1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:42.080]  nine because if it's free give me three no i'm serious i mean this is a this is a historic
[1:07:42.080 --> 1:07:48.640]  moment in my life right here actually this is me at a mls soccer game and i just i was so inspired
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:56.400]  that i had to get a covid 19 vaccine and they were so bored they had so many vaccines and no one
[1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:01.040]  to take i just kept showing up they just kept jack and they just kept jacking right into my vein
[1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:07.120]  and hit me with that magical sauce the next thing you know i'm like seizing on the field like
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:15.520]  and i said hey whoa calm down guys i'm just i'm just having a vaccine reaction totally normal
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:18.880]  no free vaccine at the soccer game
[1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:25.200]  oh oh my gosh i'm sorry it's just
[1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:34.080]  you just you have to laugh it's just so ridiculous it's just so ridiculous
[1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:41.200]  and ironically enough as i'm standing there and i'm having my picture taken in front of the free
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:45.760]  covid 19 vaccine tent i mean this is a historic moment folks not every day you get a free mra
[1:08:45.760 --> 1:08:53.040]  injection and uh i got 10 of them one shot but um i'm sitting there making fun of this thing
[1:08:54.160 --> 1:09:01.200]  and uh a lady walks by and she's like oh she's like yeah the vaccine is stupid whatever
[1:09:02.240 --> 1:09:08.000]  she's like oh i had to get the vaccine to travel internationally and i was so sick i couldn't travel
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:16.960]  yeah hey but thank god you got that vaccine Lloyd Austin because uh i guess you'd be like us
[1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:21.280]  unvaccinated people dead i'm dead according to them i never got the vaccine and they said

[1:09:55.040 --> 1:09:59.600]  about folks that's what it's all about all right let's go back to the phone lines here we've got
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:06.800]  danny in new york danny you're on the alex jones show go ahead oh i am a retired deputy sheriff
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:12.160]  in rochester new york which is one of the most dangerous cities in the country to live in in
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:19.040]  about two weeks we got the final countdown our governor has made virtually every area that you
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:27.040]  can go into a quote unquote sensitive area that means you can't carry a firearm into any of those
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:32.160]  areas and of course those are the most dangerous areas in in new york were probably the highest
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:39.520]  rate of gun crime not only gun crime car jackings are spiked in rochester right now
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:45.760]  it's bad my friend's daughter just got car jacked and you know they're shooting every single night
[1:10:45.760 --> 1:10:52.320]  you know it's just it's out of hand and you know you figure after 25 plus years of working as a
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:58.560]  deputy sheriff that there would be at least and i don't want to say we're categorized of anything
[1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:02.560]  special and we shouldn't be treating anything different than any group anybody else but not
[1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:12.880]  even myself is has an exception against these rules so so so wait a minute all is it only police
[1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:21.680]  officers that can carry that in in in those zones well from my idea they're exempt um as an alleo
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:29.280]  or peace officers but retired peace officers as of right now peace or police officers are not
[1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:35.040]  included in the exemption list um you would have to actually probably become an i mean that is just
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:40.480]  crazy that is just insane like why i mean just think about the common sense of it
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:50.320]  why would you tell criminals you're disarmed like what it's it's mind-boggling the the complete ill
[1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:56.400]  logic of it i'm sure you heard some of the rules associated with these restrictions that she laid
[1:11:56.400 --> 1:12:02.160]  down it especially with businesses that they plan to post a sign on their window that says we allow
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:07.760]  guns inside here it's okay to come in this is like a comedy they're supposed to be concealed brother
[1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:12.960]  they're guys pull up but you said this was in rochester guys pull up a map of the the new york
[1:12:12.960 --> 1:12:17.680]  boroughs or whatever and i mean because i mean this is honestly this is a comedy skit because
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:25.120]  it's like okay all right everyone uh this part of the map it's like i'm the governor
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:35.440]  this part of the map right here no one has a gun right here at this part you're not allowed to have
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:43.600]  a gun so if there's any criminals listening don't go here this is not where you want to go
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:51.760]  oh there are no guns allowed here no citizens can have a gun either and and we're no exception to
[1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:56.400]  the rule and we're gonna defund the police and disarm the police and they don't go there either
[1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:05.120]  yes right here guys see no guns allowed so if you're a criminal listening right here you see this
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:11.600]  you are not allowed to have a gun there so all law-abiding citizens will be disarmed all right
[1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:21.360]  so if you're a criminal do not go to this part of the map there are no guns here allowed don't go
[1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:28.000]  here oh i wonder what the reaction to that's going to be danie well let me tell you something
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:34.720]  another thing just happened just a few days ago they made an announcement that no active law enforcement
[1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:41.440]  officers are allowed to carry at the new york state fair whatsoever so now okay so the skit continues
[1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:49.120]  after law enforcement so the skit continues not only are there no guns in this exact specific area
[1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:56.480]  we will not have any armed police officers there entered ever never so there you go we've done it
[1:13:56.480 --> 1:14:04.560]  we defeated crime no we just did the exact opposite not even snake not even snake plisken can bust us
[1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:11.040]  out of new york at this time it's bad that is insane danie thank you so much for the call
[1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:18.960]  let's go to paul in florida paul you're on the alex joneshow uh go ahead hey guys i can't believe
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:23.280]  what's going on right now i just can't even believe that people don't believe it that's what blows
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.000]  the way the most is the damn stockholm syndrome we got going on well i think you've got that but
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:38.080]  the one caller said earlier i mean liberals like wild far left radical liberals that have just fully
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:42.240]  in on this abortion death call vaccine death call like all of it just the world's gonna end
[1:14:42.240 --> 1:14:47.520]  in five-year death call they like it i mean they like seeing their opposition getting tortured
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:54.480]  yeah yeah i mean it's unbelievable it's massive brainwashing on a scale you've never even seen
[1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:58.560]  and uh i mean alex has been talking about it forever that i can't wait to get the great
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:04.160]  reset the books but uh i'm telling you man it's just incredible the way people can look right at
[1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:11.920]  the increases in death the poison in the vaccine the the censorship well they write mainstream news
[1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:16.720]  articles because they got it's all about the victim economy and they say they say trans kids
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:24.640]  and lgbtq youth have the highest suicide rates and it's like you did that to them right like like
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:28.480]  you're you're victimizing them because they're committing suicide you're the one that did that
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:34.640]  to them i mean you have to admit it's a mental condition you know i mean you're talking trans
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:40.720]  sexual gay i mean it's a mental condition and they've been put in that condition on purpose
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:44.320]  yeah it's like i mean you know because you got to be honest with doctors and stuff or you know
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.040]  so if they ask you you know do you have a history of mental illness in your family say well i mean

[1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:56.640]  in houston stephanie you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hi can you hear me yes okay i know i'm
[1:20:56.640 --> 1:21:01.680]  not annoying when people say that okay i made notes so that i won't take up your time um i
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:08.080]  wanted to say that for years now i've listened to y'all and when i try to listen to their podcast
[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:15.840]  or friends share other podcasts they're rehashing information in research that y'all put out for
[1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:21.760]  probably weeks or months earlier so that's a source of it really bothers me i know y'all are
[1:21:21.760 --> 1:21:27.680]  probably aware of that i guess we wish people would understand that a lot of people are just
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:35.520]  strictly sharing your research so that's one thing deborah tivarez is the only other person
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:43.360]  researcher um who who has shared anywhere close to the same degree of information that y'all share
[1:21:43.360 --> 1:21:48.080]  and does the same amount of research and i've always wondered why she has never been on your show
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:55.440]  um she's with stuff the crime what was the name again something tivarez yeah deborah tivarez
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:22:03.440]  is amazing and between her and your information you've changed my life because she what she i mean
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:10.080]  she's amazing like alex as far as reading and researching and you know parceling out the information
[1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:16.640]  so that people can understand about let's just say water wars um food you know all the things
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:23.120]  that are going on now her and alex were talking about four years ago five years ago um so for
[1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:29.120]  me i want to say that info wars has influenced my life tremendously to look at me nobody would be able
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:36.160]  to tell that i bought a farm um i'm having my well as being finished this week um i learned
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:43.600]  more than i ever cared to about abortion yeah i think abortion education is very very important
[1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:49.200]  and alex you know he gets graphic with it and he forces you to have to go look like what is this
[1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:55.200]  man talking about so i learned a lot about the technology to see the life inside of the womb
[1:22:55.200 --> 1:23:00.880]  now and so there's no denying that that's a life that's a human in there you know and i can't believe
[1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:07.040]  when i have conversations with people about it um i wrote a song about right to life and i when
[1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:12.320]  i people try to ask why i care so much well my god have you done any research at all and when i
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:18.160]  tell them about partial birth abortions and beg them to look at um videos like justice for the five
[1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:25.120]  or whatnot they they don't they think that's just a rarity they don't understand we're murdering human
[1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:31.520]  beings and um the other thing i wanted to ask you is um you mentioned earlier the world world
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:39.760]  economic forum and governor abbott is one of their students as is obviously biancrenshaw
[1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:49.360]  what say you well abbott is essentially the lesser of the evils that can run the state of texas right
[1:23:49.360 --> 1:23:56.400]  now and he's certainly better than robert frances oh roark who wants to take our firearms and god
[1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:04.000]  knows what else that whack job would do um you know tulsi gabbert is also in the world economic
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:10.080]  forum class too so you know i think that just because they brought you in and tried to train you
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:15.920]  and indoctrinate you into all these things as young leaders maybe they don't all totally sell out
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:20.560]  and that's why you don't really see the greg abbott's and the tulsi gabbert's really
[1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:25.920]  showing up or showing out any world economic forum policies or at any of their events and not
[1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:30.960]  really getting um you know lifted up by the establishment whereas someone like diancrenshaw
[1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:36.480]  i think wants to cater uh to those people a little bit more and then you just have the
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:44.960]  total sell out operatives like tridot and ardent in new zealand and so many others so um but yes
[1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:51.360]  i i'm not the biggest advocate of greg abbott but compared to oh roark i mean there's it's
[1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:58.080]  it's kind of just lighten day unfortunately evidently screws us with a smile on his face i mean he
[1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:04.240]  looks like a genuinely um decent human being and that's what that's what throws me off and i mean
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:08.080]  all things considered i mean again it's like i shouldn't have to beg a governor to keep our
[1:25:08.080 --> 1:25:12.880]  state open because some people get sick but i mean he did for the most part keep texas more
[1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:18.880]  open than most places and i mean he at least talks about the border security he doesn't
[1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:23.760]  do enough but no i mean abbott is uh yeah abbott's abbots a squish republican needs to do more for
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:29.280]  texas stephanie thanks for the call let's go to roe in florida where the best governor
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:37.120]  is in charge uh desantis roe you're on the air go ahead hey um i was uh i was thinking that um
[1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:43.760]  you know florida seems kind of like a last stand kind of state you know in my opinion and
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.760]  you know i thought it would be cool if like info wars was like able to expand you know
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:56.160]  into florida not you know not that i know whether or not that's possible but you know it would be
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:03.280]  kind of cool if if we did have like a an info wars satellite in florida well yeah i mean we
[1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:07.840]  you know we've kind of had operations in europe before but if you've noticed we've kind of had
[1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:12.720]  to scale some things back uh just to keep our transmissions going on air here and that was
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:16.560]  that was kind of the agenda is to let's just keep the live transmissions going we got more
[1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:20.960]  people tuning in than ever before and we don't really get on the road as much or expand as much
[1:26:20.960 --> 1:26:27.120]  so it's it's it's hard to expand right now when they're trying to shut us down yeah i
[1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:32.960]  realized that going on going process i'd like to plug for info wars real quick though because i've
[1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:39.280]  had a lot of stuff that i've got from info wars um i've got the elective pure water filter i've
[1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:47.520]  had vaso beat uh survival shield x2 super silver immune support fish oil krill oil knockout bone
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:52.560]  broth vitamin mineral fusion and we're now me and my wife are currently trying the new diet
[1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:57.760]  force and we like that seems to be helping us out too well you've tried just about it all
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:02.720]  yeah we've uh now there's probably more things i've tried that's all i can think of off the top
[1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:09.920]  of my head well we appreciate your support it's just the products that i've tried so far have
[1:27:09.920 --> 1:27:15.440]  been way better and i have tried in comparison to store bought products and there's just no
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:21.920]  comparison they're just from what uh from what i've tried and uh i feel like uh i'm definitely
[1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:27.600]  getting my money's worth when i uh buy info or store products well that's what alex did i mean
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:34.320]  some of the stuff we have is the top selling products at let's say a whole foods that we just
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:39.440]  private label other stuff is totally proprietary but that's what alex does is he goes out he gets
[1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:42.960]  the best ingredients makes the best supplement and tries to sell it at the lowest price i mean
[1:27:42.960 --> 1:27:48.720]  that's just and and because of that we have small margins and so yeah we don't have a billion dollars
[1:27:48.720 --> 1:27:52.320]  like these lawyers claim in the case like we're worth billions of dollars the margins on the
[1:27:52.320 --> 1:28:00.160]  supplements most most supplement companies have huge margins because they put a little amount of
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:04.560]  product in there and sell it for high we do the opposite we have the most product in there and
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:10.160]  sell it as low as we possibly can and usually offer it on sale too uh so our margins are thin
[1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:14.160]  but they say oh you they've got a billion they're worth a billion dollars they have a supplement
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.880]  company well okay if a supplement company works to make a profit and they have big margins then
[1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:24.560]  yes the supplement company does well we have a supplement company to fund a news operation
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:29.680]  so it's like we're the supplement company isn't just making money the supplement company makes
[1:28:29.680 --> 1:28:35.680]  money to fund the news operation and the margins are obviously small but you know what with the
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:41.280]  audience's support like roy in florida and the audience's uh prayers and and spreading of the
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:47.360]  links i believe we're gonna get through this next trial this next challenge this next tribulation
[1:28:47.360 --> 1:28:53.520]  and continue to be on air into the future and hopefully continuing to bring you great products
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:29:04.720]  at infowarstore.com sold out for more than a year and a half because of supply chain breakdowns our

[1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:56.640]  hope well hope for the hope for the best prepare for the worst right yep that's it um uh my also
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:02.320]  my my father passed away a couple months back and uh i i was playing caregiver trying to
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:08.960]  take care of my my father keeping him out of the nursing home and uh when he passed away i talked
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:15.360]  i i got talked into the funeral director and uh and he said he agreed with you what you guys are
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:22.000]  saying the deaths are uh oh there's no doubt i mean insurance companies are reporting a mass spike
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:29.040]  in deaths and it is odd because i mean you what you're gonna see is you can take a five-year
[1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:38.160]  sample let's say and maybe the best would be 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 and you're gonna see that eight
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:42.880]  you're gonna see that 18 19 20 pretty much had the exact same death rate and you're gonna see that
[1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:49.920]  2021 and 2022 had an increase of a death rate of at least probably one or one percent any one percent
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:56.320]  is a mass a huge increase usually the difference is like 0.2 percent in any given year uh one percent
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:59.920]  would be a huge increase and and i think that's what the numbers are going to bear out when you
[1:37:59.920 --> 1:38:04.320]  take a five-year sample when it's all said and done but yeah funeral directors are calling it out
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:09.760]  insurance agencies are calling it out morticians are calling it out it's just it's so obvious at
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:17.840]  this point and and most people uh sadly even the ones that got the vaccine uh now know that uh they
[1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:23.760]  were sold a bill of goods and it's not only not safe or effective but the likelihood of you having
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:29.760]  a side effect are pretty high matt thanks for the call we go to uh we go to canada now first time in
[1:38:29.760 --> 1:38:37.120]  canada today to jerry jerry you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hi i went uh i watched your show
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:42.160]  uh i used to watch on rumble and uh i was watching yesterday and i had the live chat
[1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:46.960]  only and there's a couple of jokers there cutting you up high-fiving each other they must know each
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:53.280]  other so anyway i made a comment i didn't talk to them i didn't get provoked by their obviously
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:39:00.400]  trying to provoke i just typed something uh was uh against pedophile it was like all pedophiles
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:08.400]  should be home that's it and oh actually maybe all pedophiles should be uh skinned a lot and uh
[1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:15.360]  not 10 minutes later i got deactivate actually deactivate not even not even reprimand it i
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:20.720]  can't even go back my account was this on maybe maybe because i called myself trump and the number
[1:39:20.720 --> 1:39:25.680]  one but i think it's because you were actually talking about how something is happening when
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:32.240]  this happens something's going on right now behind the scenes and i do that people on your live chat
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:40.080]  wait wait are you talking about on rumble yet on rumble i used to be on rumble as of yesterday
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:45.600]  as of yeah as of yesterday after i made that comment i don't believe we have any moderators
[1:39:45.600 --> 1:39:50.720]  there i think that those are rumble moderators i could be wrong yes yes yes like that like i like
[1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:55.920]  it's so true is that on rumble they're they're watching you so closely there i made a comment
[1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:01.600]  and i got deactivated from rumble well i'm not surprised they'd be watching us closely my my
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:05.920]  guess is though and i i don't know how the process works so i'm i'm having to take a guess but my
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.720]  guess is because this is how it usually works is whoever those individuals were that didn't like
[1:40:10.720 --> 1:40:16.400]  your comment they probably reported you for abuse and there's probably no real back check of that
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:20.480]  just if they see multiple reports they probably just file it instead of actually looking into it
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:25.200]  and that's probably why your account got silenced or whatever but anyway i liked also not i got
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:31.360]  expecting that in 2015 i was a blind person i listened to the news and up here in canada the
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:35.920]  news saying all hillary's the best trump's not going to win i sort of believed it and my whole
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:41.520]  way i didn't even know about info but then when trump got in and he started doing good things
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:47.040]  and everybody turned against them that's when my eyes opened up that's when something happened to me
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:51.920]  and that's when i found info work well it was so obvious i mean it's like when all the corrupt
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:58.720]  people the career politicians the lying media all of them when they all team up against one man i mean
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:04.000]  it couldn't be more obvious that's what actually opened my eyes i mean if you had to say moment
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.560]  i mean that was the moment and now it's just been amplified with the raid on mora lago and also i
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:15.360]  noticed a little bit like i'm watching tv now they got this relax team coming out and they got
[1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:20.720]  all of these things that you guys actually sell why don't you like why aren't you advertising on tv
[1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:26.080]  well they wouldn't let us advertise on the tv yeah that is ripping off your knockout you know
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:32.720]  that's so funny you say that jerry i noticed that it and it's not just uh whatever i guess it's a
[1:41:32.720 --> 1:41:39.280]  sleep age you're talking about they have tried they have tried to and and hey it's fine we make
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.240]  great products i don't blame them i don't blame them for stealing our ingredients but yes it's
[1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:49.920]  specifically at conservative naval cable news networks and they will basically rip off a product
[1:41:49.920 --> 1:41:56.640]  of ours that either is proprietary or just something we private label and i remember specifically the
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:04.000]  one that we have that is proprietary or that we've kind of really popularized is a dna force
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  and dna force plus and uh i forget all the ingredients off the top my head but it's it's
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:17.760]  known to um help the telomeres on your dna um and and that's good for the aging process and it has
[1:42:17.760 --> 1:42:22.960]  so many great ingredients and it's a it's a very elite supplement it's probably the flagship most
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:28.160]  expensive supplement we have here and i remember a couple years ago someone tried to recreate dna
[1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:34.480]  force and they were selling it kind the same concept same idea same ingredients with the
[1:42:34.480 --> 1:42:41.440]  coq 10 and everything and they were selling it for five hundred dollars a bottle five hundred
[1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:47.440]  dollars and they were marketing on uh conservative cable news networks well it didn't last i don't
[1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:50.880]  know if people didn't buy it or if it was too expensive or they didn't like it but dna force
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.640]  plus always sells out so it's sold out right now but yeah they try to steal our product ideas too
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:02.000]  because they're the best the great reset in the war for the world is the book that the government
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:07.440]  doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life
[1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:12.960]  the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book they want to control what you think
[1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:18.480]  what you do what you read but you don't want that and alex jones doesn't want that and this book
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:24.080]  shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to fight against it and so by
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:29.040]  buying this book you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work that freedom is alive in
[1:43:29.040 --> 1:43:35.120]  this country this is essential reading and you know i would go right now and buy it before the

[1:47:51.520 --> 1:47:56.000]  wisconsin now finally the board has come back around to john in wisconsin john you're on the
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:04.640]  here go ahead uh yeah i'm just uh curious about trump he said that the vaccine was one of the
[1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:10.400]  greatest achievements of mankind and the people in the hospital are those that don't take it
[1:48:11.360 --> 1:48:18.880]  so is he a con man or an idiot you know i think uh you might even be fair to say both
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:24.480]  in that regard because i think he is obviously conning people when he says that the vaccine
[1:48:24.480 --> 1:48:30.160]  the covid-19 vaccine was was good but but here's here's what i think his logic is
[1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:33.520]  which is a flawed logic but this is what i believe his logic is
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:39.120]  um the whole reason we were able to get the economy back open and everything was because
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:44.480]  of the vaccines and the pandemic was stopped because of the vaccines now obviously both of those
[1:48:45.920 --> 1:48:52.480]  conclusions are wrong so he is just straight up wrong but if he's consciously lying about that
[1:48:52.480 --> 1:48:57.520]  then yeah he's a con man or if he just doesn't know any better then you could say he's just he's
[1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:02.400]  wrong on that or your words an idiot no on the vaccine subject on that issue trump completely
[1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:07.920]  blew it and it was such a it was such a letdown because we know he'd been skeptical of vaccines
[1:49:07.920 --> 1:49:12.640]  in the past and and maybe thought family members of his were injured by vaccines so for him to just
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:20.160]  completely screw us on that vaccine deal was really a big letdown yeah it is kind of interesting
[1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:26.720]  because he can't be real enough about it which makes me curious about him why can't he just be
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:33.680]  straight up open about the vaccine well i think again you gotta understand no nobody's nobody's
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.240]  gonna be perfect nobody's gonna be perfect trump can mis-measure things and make mistakes
[1:49:38.240 --> 1:49:42.880]  and keep in mind that there's probably people in his ear telling him things about these vaccines
[1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:48.000]  and telling him telling him about the results that that he doesn't even know what's actually going on
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:53.440]  but it was odd the last time he had a rally and mentioned the vaccines he got booed and
[1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:59.200]  i don't think he said anything about them since so i think he got the message to at least pipe down
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:06.640]  on the vaccines after getting booed at a rally months ago uh this wasn't long ago it was uh on
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:13.440]  the interview with uh kandace allen uh i'm just curious and skeptical about the guy um
[1:50:13.440 --> 1:50:19.600]  um sure maybe absolutely be skeptical uh that's that's all i got i'm just going to hear your
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:25.200]  opinion and uh your thoughts i just chalk it up to there's never going to be a politician that
[1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:29.280]  agrees with everything i think he's getting bad information on the subject and part of him might
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:32.720]  kind of even be a little ashamed a little embarrassed and he doesn't want to admit he was
[1:50:32.720 --> 1:50:37.360]  he was wrong about the vaccines and he promoted something that ended up being a bad product um
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:41.760]  but to me i think the good outweighs the bad with trump in that regard
[1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.160]  and that's why i'm not willing to throw the baby out with the bath water at this point and i think
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:54.160]  after the the raid at marlago uh certainly that put a lot of wind into his sails to run again
[1:50:54.160 --> 1:50:58.560]  and i think a lot of people will get behind him uh after the raid as well all right let's go to
[1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:02.560]  chris in michigan chris you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:14.800]  chris going once twice and missing like joe biden let's go to jacob in texas jacob you're on the
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:24.240]  air go ahead hello hello hey uh oh and first thing i'd like to say i apologize um for everything
[1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:32.800]  just before god um now on to the next thing though i would like to say and this is i apologize
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:39.440]  first and foremost because i was once um in the group that controlled the cia and under uh what
[1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:46.400]  was operation c job spiritual and international justice and warfare um and so with that being
[1:51:46.400 --> 1:51:54.400]  said i really um i really have a lot to expound in this moment but that that that is um illuminating
[1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:59.680]  an eye opening to the public but essentially what's happening in the grand scheme of things is that
[1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:08.320]  lucifer and satan come to appear before these politicians and they offered them a choice of
[1:52:08.320 --> 1:52:14.160]  wealth and power and this is literally hallucinations i i've hallucinated lucifer and satan before
[1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:20.080]  and and i called upon the name of god and he saved me and i i said i leave my decision to god and so
[1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:26.320]  god chose for me instead um that i would be falling victim to satan and lucifer instead of one of
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:32.960]  their accomplices but um so so i just want to know have you heard anything regarding that fact that
[1:52:32.960 --> 1:52:39.840]  that these politicians literally hallucinate lucifer and satan and they um um they're they're
[1:52:39.840 --> 1:52:44.240]  given this wealth and power because spiritual warfare is such a and this is the subject i
[1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:52.720]  worked under in the cia is um is um just spiritual warfare in general because you know how science
[1:52:52.720 --> 1:52:58.000]  is intertwined with the spiritual realm there's no there's no denial with this fact that every
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:02.960]  thing will actually take is a test for order or disorder so with that being said no matter what
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:09.520]  you do in this realm um satan and lucifer are charged by god to deceive humanity i just wanted
[1:53:09.520 --> 1:53:18.960]  to know how far you've known about this fact well that's kind of a complex and heavy question
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:25.040]  as far as you know what politicians engage in what rituals i i i obviously don't know
[1:53:25.040 --> 1:53:31.680]  all the details there it's no secret that the cia and and the government has been working with
[1:53:31.680 --> 1:53:38.160]  mind control programs and using hallucinogenic drugs yes like lsd and other things in that
[1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:43.840]  process i think in the modern day the drug of choice at least for kind of the cultural
[1:53:43.840 --> 1:53:50.560]  ritualistic ceremonies is dmt they don't really like the iowaska that's more of a spiritual thing
[1:53:50.560 --> 1:53:54.240]  and kind of farther out there but the dmt is kind of a quick hit you can get in and out and you
[1:53:54.240 --> 1:54:00.160]  can kind of control the experience a little bit more um so i know that that type of stuff goes down
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:06.160]  we don't we have declassified documents about what they were doing with with lsd and others
[1:54:06.160 --> 1:54:13.600]  to people and and and brain controlling them um but as far as what politicians or people are doing
[1:54:13.600 --> 1:54:19.680]  with with the hallucinogenic you know satanic rituals i mean i i don't know the facts as you
[1:54:19.680 --> 1:54:25.520]  say behind all of that i wouldn't be surprised if that's going down behind the scenes uh in fact it
[1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:30.160]  would probably make more sense than assuming that these people are just that stupid or or that big
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:33.760]  of liars is that they're all in some sort of weird satanic cult where they do these rituals
[1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:40.240]  but uh there's no doubt there aren't there is no doubt that there's a group of elite
[1:54:41.200 --> 1:54:47.440]  that engage in rituals and they don't believe what they're seeing is a hallucination
[1:54:48.080 --> 1:54:52.560]  they believe it's actually there and and and through the shared experience
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:57.360]  they've landed on the conclusion that it's it's real and so they're actually communicating with
[1:54:57.360 --> 1:55:02.480]  satan or these other little demons uh let's jump to another phone call here though before we get
[1:55:02.480 --> 1:55:07.360]  to off the rails let's go to keith in virginia keith you're on the alex joneshow go ahead
[1:55:08.960 --> 1:55:14.960]  hey oh and i got a good omen maybe from a local election here in uh chest filled county
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:22.000]  we had a republican primary over the weekend on saturday with a very limited voting time from 10
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:29.040]  to two um and the only person you really hear about running is the establishment republican
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:35.440]  candidate that's endorsed by all the sort of rhinos that we don't like so i go up here and vote
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:41.600]  and i find out oh this is a primary i'm like well who's running and then i find out oh there's this
[1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:50.480]  other lady named jen um mcninch who's running against the uh terra carol establishment person
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:56.880]  and i go talk to her and i'm finding out oh my gosh i'm voting for i'm voting for uh the lady i'd
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:02.960]  never heard of before i got here and i thought i talked to her a little bit outside the polling
[1:56:02.960 --> 1:56:08.960]  place and i said boy i didn't even know you were on the ballot it's probably a long shot but you
[1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:17.120]  know if you don't win this time hang in there and lo and behold she overwhelmingly won with a 12
[1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:22.400]  margin so i'm kind of thinking hey if this is a microcosm omen for the rest of the country
[1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:29.440]  maybe we'll have some victories well it's a lot easier to have those victories in smaller counties
[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:35.520]  i mean i'm guessing chesterfield county is not too big no it's it's big it's it's one of the
[1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:42.240]  largest in the state and she was still able to pull it off larger yeah yeah yeah it's huge well
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:49.040]  there's no doubt there is a there is i don't know what you want to call it there's a challenge inside
[1:56:49.040 --> 1:56:54.480]  of the republican party from outsiders non-establishment republicans and you can you can see the
[1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:59.120]  republican establishment pushing its choice for candidates in the primaries and then you can see
[1:56:59.120 --> 1:57:03.680]  the more trump supporting america first type candidates kind of going head to head with the
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:09.440]  republican establishment some of them having victories some of them getting railroaded uh
[1:57:09.440 --> 1:57:13.440]  but yeah that that's definitely a phenomenon happening in the republican party right now
[1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:19.520]  not happening in democrat party elections uh those are mostly going uncontested actually
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:24.880]  it's funny too you should say that because everybody was so happy there and all i could
[1:57:24.880 --> 1:57:32.080]  come to find out you know they're all republicans hey man uh mega ditto's to turbo force alexa

[1:59:55.040 --> 2:00:07.440]  the cause of nearly every american war and the mother of today's corruption it's the federal reserve
[2:00:08.080 --> 2:00:19.040]  okay zero point five percent of the citizen's country own more assets than the bottom
[2:00:19.040 --> 2:00:26.400]  90 percent that's all happened over the last 10 years since 2008 the federal reserve by the way
[2:00:27.040 --> 2:00:33.440]  that's owned not by the american people a central bank that's owned by 24 prime brokers being jp morgan
[2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:40.880]  and goldman son morgan stanley how does that work we don't need to audit the we need to end the federal
[2:00:40.880 --> 2:00:51.520]  reserve the federal reserve has usurped has usurped has usurped its power and the power of the american
[2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:57.120]  people and our elective representatives and no they do not have the consent of the government we
[2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:03.360]  will not comply we will not submit and it must be ended the federal reserve banking system
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:10.240]  introduced the most destructive form of usury the modern world has ever known a debt-based
[2:01:10.240 --> 2:01:17.680]  currency designed to rob and enslave entire nations the federal reserve prints money out of
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:23.600]  thin air and this is given the crooks who wield it the power and influence to create their own
[2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:31.120]  corporate government within the united states and the irs has made every hardworking american
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:38.720]  into a criminal guilty until proven innocent the irs was always seen as unconstitutional
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:47.280]  but in 1913 the powers of the irs were weaponized and made de facto law by the 16th amendment
[2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:53.280]  never properly ratified which states that the government can collect a percentage of everyone's
[2:01:53.280 --> 2:02:01.600]  income over 50 of americans refuse this unconstitutional amendment but the irs will come
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:08.480]  after you they have a long reputation for targeting religious groups and political opponents
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:16.400]  and it's only looking to get much worse the inflation reduction act guarantees more inflation
[2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:22.720]  with the billions of dollars required to be printed out of thin air and while local police
[2:02:22.720 --> 2:02:30.720]  are defunded so that violent criminals are set free the irs is being funded to hire over 80
[2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:38.320]  000 new agents to make sure everyone is paying their taxes and they have recently bought five
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:45.120]  million rounds of ammunition they are building their own police force to execute search warrants
[2:02:45.120 --> 2:02:52.000]  make arrests and exert the use of deadly force while many liberal progressives may argue that
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:58.800]  the crimes of the federal reserve are necessary they are hurting people worldwide because it's
[2:02:58.800 --> 2:03:05.600]  the world's reserve currency 40 percent of international transactions are in usd and as the
[2:03:05.600 --> 2:03:12.160]  fed continues pushing the illusion of a strong dollar the rest of the world is made poor if the
[2:03:12.160 --> 2:03:18.240]  americans don't remedy the situation soon then the international community has a reasonable
[2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:26.640]  excuse to get involved the entire international fiat system is collapsing and the crooks responsible
[2:03:26.640 --> 2:03:33.600]  will be selling us a new centralized digital currency which is obviously another trap
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:40.400]  but the alternative is simple restore the constitutional republic to promote the general
[2:03:40.400 --> 2:03:47.200]  welfare and secure the blessings of liberty with sound money backed by gold and silver
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:58.000]  and the fed the irs the cia the fbi it's written right there on your hundred dollar reserve note
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:05.600]  whenever any form of government becomes destructive it is the right of the people to alter or to
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:12.160]  abolish it and to institute new government that will most benefit their safety and happiness
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:18.080]  what is the highest federal income tax any american should have to pay
[2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:24.000]  well we should have the lowest tax that we've ever had and up until 1913 it was zero percent
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:31.920]  lots of bad about that i would like to follow up on that because i think the question on taxes
[2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:38.080]  is generally misleading because anytime you spend money it's a tax you might tax you might borrow
[2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:42.960]  you might inflate the vicious tax is attacking the american people the retired people today
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:47.840]  is the inflation tax the devaluation of the currency the standard of living is going down
[2:04:47.840 --> 2:04:53.120]  and you need to address that and that's why i want to make the inflation tax zero as well
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:05:02.640]  so your answer is zero zero reporting for info wars sold out for more than a year and a half

[2:09:14.400 --> 2:09:19.280]  i've had work bro all right well you're you're half you're half and half because all right all
[2:09:19.280 --> 2:09:24.000]  right so you're still clean he did he did do three segments this morning but i i i did promote it
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:27.360]  like he was going to host the whole show and that's what was the plan but here i am all right
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:31.840]  you're stuck with me again all right you're clean bro you're clean so i just wanted to say about the
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:37.760]  uh about the rate on marlago they had uh the search warrant that had a specific list right
[2:09:38.400 --> 2:09:43.040]  the specific list of things they were going after and they had a list why did take nine hours why
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:47.680]  were they there nine hours searching yeah none of it adds up and to be honest i don't even trust
[2:09:47.680 --> 2:09:53.920]  that list you know what i think they were looking for epstein's client list that's what i think
[2:09:53.920 --> 2:10:01.200]  i know there's so many questions and i'm looking forward to see what bob thinks about it because
[2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:05.680]  there's so many different angles there's so many deep state elements that are scared of
[2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:09.680]  what trump might have or what trump might know it's like how do you know are they all
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:17.120]  operating together to go in there or was this one person freaking out man it's crazy that's all i know
[2:10:17.120 --> 2:10:22.880]  but uh a couple years ago i left social media right once uh they took alex and you and everybody
[2:10:22.880 --> 2:10:28.720]  off the one right once y'all disappeared we stayed on facebook trying to to keep the show on every
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:34.960]  live we'd all get banned you know and uh so i've left uh social media alone completely for two years
[2:10:34.960 --> 2:10:40.560]  i want to tell the facebook people man uh wane and steve and jj and all of y'all man miss y'all
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:47.440]  man seriously i know you're all listening but it's crazy man i hope y'all make it through this man
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:54.320]  i really do well that's the plan and uh we're gonna fight and scratch and claw to be on here
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:59.040]  every day if that's what it takes but uh we've got a great audience uh that supports us and
[2:10:59.040 --> 2:11:04.000]  prays for us and you guys shop at our store so i mean we're gonna we're gonna chug it out every
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:08.080]  day is a victory for free speech that we're on air every day so we just you know when they when
[2:11:08.080 --> 2:11:12.240]  they have their victory against free speech that'll be the day we're off air but here we are another
[2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:20.080]  day still on the air shane thank you for the call let's go to jefferson in virginia uh jefferson
[2:11:20.080 --> 2:11:24.160]  you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey allen thanks for taking my call
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:32.160]  yes i said you want to talk about carmela harris on the board absolutely i i hope you can ask
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.520]  robert barnes at some point either either on the air or off the air is he aware that she is a jamaican
[2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:45.120]  citizen at birth under their constitution chapter two paragraph three c she's a citizen of jamaica
[2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:49.440]  from the moment of her birth even though she was born in oakland california so she's a dual
[2:11:49.440 --> 2:11:55.280]  citizen at best that's supposed to be disallowed under the natural born citizen article two
[2:11:55.280 --> 2:12:01.040]  requirement and i it's a constitutional issue i barnes this is right down barnes valley i don't
[2:12:01.040 --> 2:12:07.520]  know i will ask barnes when we get barnes on i will ask him if carmela uh carmela is a uh is a
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:11.360]  legitimate but maybe that's why they made her vice president so when they got rid of biden
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:16.480]  polosi could slip in right but i don't think he's aware that she's a jamaican citizen
[2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:20.880]  that's the biggest issue it's not just about the 14th amendment it's about whether he knows
[2:12:20.880 --> 2:12:27.520]  she's a jamaican citizen at birth okay thanks i will bring that up uh and i'm sure bob will be
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:34.400]  with us in the next segment uh let's go to another caller then let's go to andrew in new york
[2:12:35.440 --> 2:12:42.880]  andrew you're on the alex joneshow go ahead hey oh great show those you hear about um that
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:48.400]  like an event called uh the pet a few days ago uh it was about like election integrity and stuff
[2:12:48.400 --> 2:12:58.160]  it was a true devotee people i did not know yeah and uh it was about um like to have a system where
[2:12:58.160 --> 2:13:03.680]  it's like uh real time you could report on like people like uh breaking election laws and stuff
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:09.360]  like that and they were talking about like other things i can see the whole thing but it's like
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:15.760]  on rumble you probably find it on that i i am planning on covering this later on the war room
[2:13:15.760 --> 2:13:21.200]  there's hilarious mainstream media stories from uh over the weekend and they're panicked and they're
[2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:28.880]  like uh republican conspiracy theorist and vote deniers are can't are are campaigning outside
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:35.600]  of drop boxes and are staking out mail-in drop boxes and the simple response would be if you're
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:41.520]  not cheating why does that bother you yeah and they actually said that um they were gonna
[2:13:41.520 --> 2:13:47.040]  shut off the cameras like towards the end of uh the show was called the pit well thank god for
[2:13:47.040 --> 2:13:53.520]  two thousand mules exposing the the mail-in drop box ballot uh fraud that happened in 2020 so maybe
[2:13:53.520 --> 2:13:57.920]  we can keep that out of the next elections yeah they said it's supposed to be a lot more about
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:14:04.480]  on the 2020 election coming out about the cheating stuff but i actually think that the devolution
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:10.080]  stuff is real and i actually heard that trump they overturned the election and trump's gonna be
[2:14:10.080 --> 2:14:15.440]  coming back in like december or january yeah i mean look those kind of pipe dream
[2:14:16.400 --> 2:14:21.680]  pie in the sky predictions never seem to come true it sounds nice it might even it might even
[2:14:21.680 --> 2:14:25.760]  like you know be the legitimate thing but some paperwork before you left
[2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:34.080]  well here's what bothers me trump continues to put out statements on his true social account
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:38.400]  because he's banned everywhere uh and so then people have to repost them on twitter and other
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:43.440]  mainstream media platforms but he keeps putting out these statements about how corrupt the fbi is
[2:14:43.440 --> 2:14:47.840]  how corrupt combi was and stroke and page and all these people and you know it's it's kind of like
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:54.880]  hey man you let them go like you got you had them dead to rights why didn't you do anything
[2:14:54.880 --> 2:15:01.120]  about it now it's coming back to buy you like duh maybe you say that's a strategy he's using but
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:05.680]  it's kind of just it's baffling you're sitting here reading about the guy who was president when
[2:15:05.680 --> 2:15:10.800]  all the corruption was going on complaining about the corruption yeah but i think durham
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:16.400]  he said durham scope is bigger than like just the the rest of stuff so i think durham is actually
[2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:23.520]  gonna play a big part in it well my friend i hope you're right but uh i would not bet on that i would
[2:15:23.520 --> 2:15:28.400]  not put too much stake in durham to do anything quite frankly he's had what like four years
[2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:33.840]  and and and what is he even doing it's like he's he's just growing a mustache or something
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:41.760]  so i hope you're right but um i i've just heard about that song and dance for way too long with no
[2:15:41.760 --> 2:15:50.000]  fruits to put any stake in it unfortunately but uh it'd be nice it would be nice all right bob barns
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:16:00.560]  coming up next on the alex joneshow don't go anywhere the great reset in the war for the world
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:06.000]  is the book that the government doesn't want you to read that most of the big powerful companies
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:11.280]  trying to control your life the big tech companies they don't want you to read this book they want
[2:16:11.280 --> 2:16:16.720]  to control what you think what you do what you read but you don't want that and alex jones
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:22.000]  doesn't want that and this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook
[2:16:22.000 --> 2:16:27.440]  for how to fight against it and so by buying this book you're gonna prove that censorship doesn't
[2:16:27.440 --> 2:16:33.600]  work that freedom is alive in this country this is a central reading and you know i would go right
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:39.040]  now and buy it before the censorship kicks in it's not going to be available in bookstores
[2:16:39.040 --> 2:16:43.440]  it's not going to be available in libraries they're going to try to take it down from every
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:48.560]  platform that they can but they're not going to be able to do it prove that censorship doesn't work
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:53.520]  by the great reset thank you alex jones i really appreciate you having me on and i appreciate you

[2:21:39.440 --> 2:21:45.360]  most people know it's complete clown world crap uh you know men or women stuff i get the same thing
[2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:49.920]  i say even doctors also ask which gender you're don't say we're not allowed to ask that these days are we
[2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:56.720]  yeah now most people know it's crap yeah but um yeah i just want to get you know i'm just losing my
[2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:00.880]  mind over here i mean there's a little bit of faith up here in the northeast you know it is pretty
[2:22:00.880 --> 2:22:06.480]  much concerned liberalism and everything but south jersey is a little bit of uh you have 50 states in
[2:22:06.480 --> 2:22:10.800]  one in new jersey south jersey is a little bit more farmland than everything so we do have some
[2:22:10.800 --> 2:22:18.560]  trump and anti-establishment you know uh uh supporters down here as far as as far as that
[2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:23.200]  goes info wars are pumping you guys up up and watching you not too long but long enough and
[2:22:23.200 --> 2:22:29.200]  putting in the hours on just i love the team and uh the satire videos gray grease videos i mean you
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:35.200]  guys crack me up i love alex doing his opera what he was freaking out well that's great i you know i
[2:22:35.200 --> 2:22:40.880]  always i always like it you know we're obviously serious here but uh if we can make a if we can
[2:22:40.880 --> 2:22:45.440]  lighten lighten your day with humor that that means a lot too when did you start listening to info
[2:22:45.440 --> 2:22:51.440]  wars chris uh i guess it's been about a year now i remember somebody had told me about alex and
[2:22:51.440 --> 2:22:55.920]  everything but uh hard to get up to hold you guys i got the app on my phone everything i do it there
[2:22:55.920 --> 2:23:01.120]  and you know i have a channel i'm able to get but it always seems to break the signal up with you
[2:23:01.120 --> 2:23:08.800]  guys so i always have you on the app on the phone and stuff like that but it's so mildly when i take
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:14.320]  calls from people that have only been listening for a year or so because i mean the audience just
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:19.600]  keeps growing the awakening just keeps growing and i mean it's wild to me to think that i'm like a
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:26.080]  veteran in this now that that's what's so crazy about it yeah i mean it i don't know i guess somebody
[2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:30.080]  pulled the wool over my eyes and i just see what's going on i've always felt like this just crazy
[2:23:30.080 --> 2:23:34.640] ness and then to see you guys actually putting everything that i was thinking and i was just
[2:23:34.640 --> 2:23:38.640]  like i'm you know we're on the same team here well see that's what it is the world is crazy
[2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:45.840]  you're not alone out there but there's not there's no reception of your ideas or there's no
[2:23:47.040 --> 2:23:51.920]  reverberation of your ideas so they're stuck in your head and you feel isolated and you feel alone
[2:23:51.920 --> 2:23:56.080]  and then you tune into info wars and you realize oh wait there's millions of us out here we're not
[2:23:56.080 --> 2:24:01.920]  alone i i have been right my my inclinations my notions my logic has been right it's just been
[2:24:01.920 --> 2:24:06.960]  i've been cut off from the feed i've been cut off from the spirit i've been cut off from the

[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:43.520]  and we're the crazy ones for they follow the science the science is telling us we were right

[2:25:47.600 --> 2:25:54.960]  glad to have you here all right let's see here let's go to jeff in maryland up there we'll stay on
[2:25:54.960 --> 2:26:02.320]  the east coast jeff you're on the alex joneshow go ahead how are you doing man i'm good i hear you
[2:26:02.320 --> 2:26:06.880]  this this movie's pretty fucking good oh excuse me this movie's pretty weird all right we got one
[2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:13.120]  dump in but you can't curse again oh don't worry about it i want um i would i'm asking you if you
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:24.240]  could possibly uh touch on the case of touch on the case of like the the uh what the american people
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:31.200]  could do against the insurance situation because it's still coming out um i didn't know if that's
[2:26:31.200 --> 2:26:39.120]  something that we could start a petition for or something of that nature um i'm not sure i've
[2:26:39.120 --> 2:26:44.560]  understood it you mean just getting the information from the insurance companies well they're all
[2:26:44.560 --> 2:26:49.360]  coming out and saying that uh you know there's three times the amount of people that they killed
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:55.920]  this year and uh due to the vaccine effects and things of that nature so i didn't know if down
[2:26:55.920 --> 2:27:00.800]  the road that would be something that we could bring out put a massive movement against the uh
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:07.120]  these company's CEOs and things of that nature well here's the problem you're not the information
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:12.400]  will come out and we'll cover it and we'll play the you know the quotes from lawyers and insurance
[2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:18.160]  company executives and everything but it's not going to get one percent of the coverage that
[2:27:18.160 --> 2:27:24.080]  the fear mongering for covid got and so that's the problem is uh it just doesn't reach that critical
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:28.080]  mass that it needs to and that's why info wars has to stay on air and that's why they want us all
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:32.240]  fair because they know that this the closest thing to getting information like that out
[2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:37.680]  is right here this is as close to critical mass to get that information out and so that's why
[2:27:37.680 --> 2:27:43.840]  they want it shut down well let me just tell you every day i drink my patreon and uh i probably
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:49.280]  spent nearly nine thousand dollars on the store i have two of the signed copies coming and i bought
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:55.040]  more of the regular ones on amazon for the family so i'm doing everything i can to uh keep the movement
[2:27:55.040 --> 2:28:00.320]  on and to all the info warriors out there around the world and stay blessed and talk and do everything
[2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:07.200]  you can't shake hands and let make make plans and keep the word alive well jeff we can't thank you
[2:28:07.200 --> 2:28:12.560]  enough it's the audience members like you that keep us on the air and and you know that's the
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:17.920]  thing about the info wars dynamic that i i think separates us from the rest is we just have a
[2:28:17.920 --> 2:28:23.840]  direct connection or rather you have a direct investment in the company you have a direct
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:29.120]  investment in free speech and what we do here and so if you don't like the investment you don't shop
[2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:33.280]  if you do like the investment you continue to shop at infowarstore.com and that's what happens
[2:28:33.280 --> 2:28:38.480]  is people continue to shop and you know they obviously want to get it shut down and so they're
[2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:43.280]  going to have to take big shots to do it and in that process they're going to increase traffic
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:49.440]  to our shows and so they've increased the traffic to our show uh but now they're just even more
[2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:54.240]  desperate to get it off the air because our numbers continue to go up despite the attacks

[2:34:01.760 --> 2:34:09.440]  go ahead how's it going on good thanks we've talked before um but we were uh i've called in about the
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:15.600]  transgender topic a while back and we also you also mentioned that we should start you know getting
[2:34:15.600 --> 2:34:21.920]  activated in our local communities and stuff and so i figured i'd start my campaign because i decided
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:28.800]  to run for school board in my area and i feel that i would be a good candidate for that so i just
[2:34:28.800 --> 2:34:33.280]  also want to thank the crew because you guys are awesome and i also want to give a quick
[2:34:33.280 --> 2:34:38.320]  plug to your hair and beard supplement i've been on it for about a month now and being an
[2:34:38.320 --> 2:34:42.480]  extra transgender and trying to find supplements that would actually help grow my beard back
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:47.120]  yours seems to be working pretty well that is an amazing story
[2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:56.560]  so what i want to start off with is that i'm running for monorai peninsula unified school
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:35:04.960]  district board of education trustee area two um i am truly grassroots and i have my education from
[2:35:04.960 --> 2:35:11.840]  hillsdale college uh mostly about the u.s document the understanding of the k-12 educational system
[2:35:11.840 --> 2:35:18.400]  going down to classic children's literature um now hillsdale is the one that uh they used to do their
[2:35:18.400 --> 2:35:23.760]  marketing on limbaugh show for years right yes yes they did that's right um and that's where
[2:35:23.760 --> 2:35:28.400]  that's when i started and i just completed most of the courses and i got my certifications and
[2:35:28.400 --> 2:35:34.640]  they're not degrees so and i'm i'm running against people who have degrees like the bma's and aas and
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:39.520]  stuff like that so i'm trying to figure out like some of these people that i'm running against they
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:44.560]  don't seem they one person seems pretty legit but the other guy i don't know he seems pretty
[2:35:44.560 --> 2:35:49.520]  fishing people around the area in my area seems like he seems a little fishy myself i don't want
[2:35:49.520 --> 2:35:55.040]  to give the names out or anything but i also wanted to hear the answer though this is the answer
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.840]  taking action getting locally political action getting into office i mean that that that that is
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:04.480]  that is one of the many solutions but that is one of the biggest solutions it's just getting
[2:36:04.480 --> 2:36:09.280]  patriots getting good people activated politically because we've just been on the sidelines and out
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:13.920]  of the fight for so long because we've just had it so good in this country but we see our lifestyle
[2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:17.760]  slipping away so uh good people like david are running for office now david uh thank you for
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:22.960]  the call best of luck with that uh hopefully we'll hear uh a success a success story down there
[2:36:23.920 --> 2:36:27.600]  let's go to mike now in colorado mike here on the alex joneshow go ahead
[2:36:28.960 --> 2:36:33.600]  yeah so there's a guy who called earlier about trump succumb and i understand why people are
[2:36:33.600 --> 2:36:38.480]  frustrated i'm frustrated and i think the whole base is frustrated with the whole covid nonsense
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:43.760]  and how he went along with it but i have a strange theory i have a feeling you know uh people like
[2:36:43.760 --> 2:36:50.080]  reagan wink and trump they tend to break through the establishment thing and i have a feeling that
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:57.040]  the people that on top uh that control everything come to these people and go okay look look there's
[2:36:57.040 --> 2:37:03.040]  no way we can stop you we'll stay out of your way we'll let you do your thing but you got to do one
[2:37:03.040 --> 2:37:09.360]  thing for us you know with trump it was covid with Ronald Reagan it was amnesty and my feeling
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:13.680]  uh because if you look at history in the civil war it was a very unavoidable war we could have
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:18.240]  dealt with it legislatively better i think that they went to lincoln said you got to start a civil
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:23.360]  war and then when they actually won in america wasn't destroyed they assassinated them so i think
[2:37:23.360 --> 2:37:27.840]  there's something with they get these populist people in because they look way too obvious and
[2:37:27.840 --> 2:37:33.360]  the people to revolt and they go along but they give them one thing they have to do to make their
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:40.960]  globalist plan work it's a interesting theory with the historical references there as well
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:48.640]  i would be more along the belief that trump was genuinely fooled by the covid stuff he he he should
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:53.120]  have gone with his original instincts to just say hey you know it's probably going to be like the
[2:37:53.120 --> 2:37:58.240]  flu but we still shouldn't lock stuff down like this and instead he had the real true con artists
[2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:03.440]  like anthony fauci uh in his ear lying to him tricking him deceiving him and he went along with
[2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:06.720]  it and so maybe he's embarrassed that he went along with it and that's still kind of why he
[2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:14.640]  doubles and triples down on it um but i think the the likelihood is more that he was deceived
[2:38:15.200 --> 2:38:20.800]  in the process than uh he he was going along to get along as you might suggest but but certainly
[2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:25.840]  an interesting take with the historical background there as well mike thanks for the call all right
[2:38:25.840 --> 2:38:32.880]  let's go to this is always fun shrimp dog in texas shrimp dog back on the air go ahead
[2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:40.160]  hey oh and nice to hear from you i'm nice to hear your voice again uh love you brother may
[2:38:40.160 --> 2:38:46.480]  y'all always bless you and all your loved ones uh i made a meme for you looks like it's about a
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:52.320]  year ago now on um bright neon it's old but i wish you'd check it out because i think you'd like it
[2:38:52.320 --> 2:39:01.120]  it's under shrimp dog archives and that's da wg but but anyways you know uh two weeks in the row
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:08.960]  at the congregation there's been people that took the vaccine that's been waiting to hear what i gotta
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:16.400]  say about alex jones and for two weeks they've been arguing that he did get a chance to defend
[2:39:16.400 --> 2:39:23.280]  himself and when i finally proved they were wrong that what they were watching was during the punitive
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:29.920]  damages stages after he had already been pronounced guilty after i proved they were wrong they were
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:34.960]  arguing me down for two weeks one thing they could say was well good he's what we still think
[2:39:34.960 --> 2:39:40.160]  that he got what he deserved and i said so the same thing could happen to you no it would never
[2:39:40.160 --> 2:39:46.240]  happen to me but you know so i'm hoping they're still thinking about it and realizing how wrong
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:51.920]  they are because i try to handle it with tenderness and gentleness because this is my brotherhood
[2:39:51.920 --> 2:39:57.920]  at the assembly you see but anyways but the problem is see the problem is this is like any other
[2:39:58.880 --> 2:40:03.040]  this is like any other thing that you might do in your life that uh feels good in the moment but
[2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:09.440]  you know is going to hurt you the next day let's say and so they just feel so good it's just such
[2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:15.040]  oh it's just so much joy to them to see alex jones get tart and feathered in public they just love
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:19.040]  it so much and that's why they try to deny what they're really into and then they just admit it's
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:24.720]  like okay yeah we just like watching this man get tortured and and suffer um so that that's really
[2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:31.600]  what it is i agree to that but it did also to add to it you know i like to analyze it even more you
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:37.680]  know they took the the vaccine they want alex to be discredited because it makes them feel better
[2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.560]  because they have buyers remorse about taking the vaccine and i told them i don't care if alex
[2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:49.600]  jones reputation gets nuked or not which which it isn't i put in parentheses the vaccines are still
[2:40:49.600 --> 2:40:54.800]  dangerous so it's a new point in the design distractions so get out of my face with that bull
[2:40:54.800 --> 2:41:00.640]  crap you know what i mean but anyway before you uh we run out of time that brought a guy brought up
[2:41:00.640 --> 2:41:06.480]  emp shield dot com there's a guy i want you to interview the lady i like her approach i'm using
[2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:14.720]  her same approach i wish you would interview steven ben new he's also emp shield dot com uh
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:19.760]  what you might call uh he uses him as sponsor whatever and and and he he pulled out that
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:26.000]  trump is heavily invested in the vaccine so all that you know uh if that's you know i i've heard
[2:41:26.000 --> 2:41:33.280]  that theory i i've never seen any proof of that and even i i just feel like if that were true
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:38.800]  even even the media that promoted the vaccine they would still be hammering trump over that i mean i
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:44.400]  don't know how they would let that one slide um but but i don't know i've heard different people
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:48.880]  say that and i and i have not really seen any evidence of that and i feel like the media would
[2:41:48.880 --> 2:41:53.440]  attack trump on that if that were the case uh shrimp dog good to hear from you again let's

[2:46:54.400 --> 2:47:04.720]  that leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:18.960]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.200]  live from freedom command central it's the alex joneshow
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:35.120]  this is the parable of watch where you take your next step
[2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:41.200]  and don't take it for granted there might always be level ground under your feet
[2:47:42.160 --> 2:47:50.080]  i was walking along yesterday with my wife here in oman Nebraska walking our french bulldog
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:56.960]  and up ahead i saw a really cool mural of it looked like an eagle with a two cans head on
[2:47:57.680 --> 2:48:02.560]  so i was looking ahead at that mural way down the street we're about to show you
[2:48:02.560 --> 2:48:06.560]  and then something pretty interesting happened but just look ahead of you
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:13.280]  does it look like any threat on that street looks completely flat looks nice
[2:48:13.280 --> 2:48:20.080]  you zoom in you can see the mural i was talking about right there
[2:48:21.920 --> 2:48:24.720]  but as you get closer if you're actually watching around
[2:48:26.240 --> 2:48:31.760]  let's see something a little bit different and this ties into so many things let's go
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:44.160]  ahead start walking down there together i see some people are looking at their phones some people
[2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:52.800]  look at the mural on the wall but some people are looking at the ground so i was walking along
[2:48:52.800 --> 2:49:00.640]  here looking at that eagle with a two can head and right when we got here someone's already
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:11.840]  filled it up since yesterday thank god this hole oh excuse me i'm wrong this hole was wide open
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:18.400]  and i stepped into it it was about a foot deeper here it looks like they've dumped something in
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:23.840]  there but imagine who was drilling these holes in the sidewalk and not thinking that somebody
[2:49:23.840 --> 2:49:30.160]  might step in it and break their leg we just saw that guy on his phone he almost stepped in it i was
[2:49:30.160 --> 2:49:37.520]  about to warning when he saw it stepped around it so i'm here looking at this
[2:49:41.840 --> 2:49:45.200]  i guess mexican eagles what you call them distracted
[2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:49.040]  there's even cooler part of the mural over here
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:58.240]  and almost broke my leg i blew my killies out eight years ago and big men stuffing in a hole
[2:49:58.240 --> 2:50:03.920]  just like that but that was in the dark that was my fault so what's the moral of this story
[2:50:06.080 --> 2:50:11.280]  if i was a litigious person i could sue the city of Omaha Nebraska where my wife's from
[2:50:12.320 --> 2:50:17.200]  for a million dollars for drilling this recent hole you can see the spray paint where they
[2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:22.560]  marked it and to put the conduit in or something perfect to break your leg but i'm not going to
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:29.200]  do it but whoever was over this job to say Omaha you need to fire whoever was in charge
[2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:34.240]  of this let this happen now let me tell you what else happened yesterday we went over and got a big
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:36.880]  pile of bricks which have now been removed
[2:50:43.600 --> 2:50:48.080]  and we went and piled them up around it someone's removed those bricks they didn't bring them back
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:57.760]  over here we grabbed a few of these bricks to put them around it so that people would see it when
[2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:03.280]  they're walking they would think oh what's that and someone removed those so since we were here
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:08.720]  yesterday what just happened we put bricks all around it someone's removed those bricks
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:15.440]  but doesn't think this is a problem and again this morning we had breakfast
[2:51:15.440 --> 2:51:22.160]  again this morning we had breakfast and walked over here and just as we were here yesterday
[2:51:23.200 --> 2:51:26.000]  someone's removed the bricks and we saw a man walking with a cell phone
[2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:32.560]  almost stepped into it but he went around it at the last minute so that's what we're talking about
[2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:41.280]  here now there's a lot of examples of this but just a few weeks ago when i was leaving
[2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:46.240]  trial in the kangaroo court in austin i saw an old man with what would look like his wife on the
[2:51:46.240 --> 2:51:51.120]  side of the road holding his chest so i told my security guys pull over let's help him
[2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:55.120]  and i didn't put that video out because people would say oh you're being opportunistic showing
[2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:59.280]  you're a hero it's not heroic when you see somebody having a heart attack and indeed he was having
[2:51:59.280 --> 2:52:03.360]  heart problems he has a heart condition to get out of your car and help him i would expect somebody
[2:52:03.360 --> 2:52:08.000]  to help me so see that's the opposite of being litigious that's just caring about people and
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:11.760]  getting involved but more and more you see reports where somebody gets hit by a car on the road
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:16.080]  and people just drive by and don't help them especially in places like china
[2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:20.480]  or people see a woman being right in the middle of the street nobody helps you you see those reports
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:28.240]  but this is an example of government completely breaking down what low IQ person cuts this
[2:52:28.240 --> 2:52:38.560]  freshly cut hole you can see it's fresh and then does it fill it they fill this one
[2:52:39.680 --> 2:52:45.760]  but they didn't fill that one again this is a microcosm i'm not just government
[2:52:47.440 --> 2:52:50.720]  refusing to fill potholes now now they make holes in the ground
[2:52:52.640 --> 2:52:57.680]  where anybody a child an old lady you name it could break their leg and it sure hurt my already
[2:52:57.680 --> 2:53:02.880]  heard of killings when i stepped into that and it's just very frustrating and some of my crew
[2:53:02.880 --> 2:53:06.240]  were like hey you we're not litigious but you ought to still make them stop doing that that
[2:53:06.240 --> 2:53:11.680]  will make them stop we need to fire incompetent people somebody needs to get in trouble for
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:15.920]  this right here like i saw this fellow earlier walking by you almost stepped in that hole then
[2:53:15.920 --> 2:53:22.160]  your brother hey how you doing man i stepped in that yesterday and i was about to warn you but
[2:53:22.160 --> 2:53:29.040]  you were smart and you stepped around it i tried to be smart i am all shows how you doing very well
[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:32.960]  how are you no but i saw you down there i'm like we're walking down here shooting a report because
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:37.760]  i almost broke my leg that yesterday i was looking at the cool mural yeah and i just stepped right
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:42.320]  in that hole can i get a picture sure man sorry i don't have like that doesn't bother me
[2:53:42.320 --> 2:53:52.960]  well so so you saw that didn't you yeah yeah i kind of yeah yeah is this not insane that's pretty
[2:53:52.960 --> 2:53:56.960]  insane yeah and it's brand new what do you think of this i mean this is just like why would you do
[2:53:56.960 --> 2:54:00.880]  that oh man that's uh kind of interesting looks like maybe they're fixing it like they're already
[2:54:00.880 --> 2:54:04.720]  doing a lot of construction here no i know but i mean anybody knows a hole in the sidewalk is not
[2:54:04.720 --> 2:54:09.200]  good it's true like check this out they filled this one yeah and then i guess they thought well
[2:54:09.200 --> 2:54:13.600]  we're not gonna be worried about this one over here and out of gobble man yeah well god bless you man
[2:54:13.600 --> 2:54:19.520]  yeah take care take care so anyways that was the guy i saw almost up in the hole so this is a real
[2:54:19.520 --> 2:54:25.520]  story and i mean i can show you my killies so just go ahead and show me for this again i was in big
[2:54:25.520 --> 2:54:33.680]  bin eight years ago i never got a fix see the chair right there see oh there's no killies
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:43.280]  they're almost done that's the 20 killies you see over here i got a killies that's normal killies
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:49.440]  there's a hole just like that this money had put the parking lot up the edge of the parking lot
[2:54:50.240 --> 2:54:54.960]  in big bin national park and i stepped in and again i'm not whining this is not about me stepping
[2:54:54.960 --> 2:55:00.080]  in a hole this is about realizing this is a metaphor for society open borders let them ship
[2:55:00.080 --> 2:55:06.000]  fentanyl in when we don't care about our fellow humans we don't deal with stuff like this it's
[2:55:06.000 --> 2:55:12.320]  going to cause a problem so i want to know who came and took the bricks away i want to know
[2:55:12.960 --> 2:55:17.600]  why this is going on i guarantee you once this goes on air the city of Omaha is going to do something
[2:55:17.600 --> 2:55:22.160]  but i feel bad even leaving this open i'm sure whoever's bricks or without that building they're
[2:55:22.160 --> 2:55:32.240]  willing to volunteer them so i'm gonna go ahead and just fill this hole up yeah that guy almost
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:52.480]  stepped in a hole he said well he kind of saw it maybe he just stepped around it magically or something
[2:55:52.480 --> 2:56:08.160]  all right so that's the parable of the hole drilled in the sidewalk the parable of the what the hell
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:12.080]  is happening to society that someone would walk off and leave that why would they fill that
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:20.480]  but not fill that that my friends is the big question info wars.com tomorrow's news today

[3:34:09.600 --> 3:34:19.840]  the big change starting happening in um september here's the deal on friday a place not too far
[3:34:19.840 --> 3:34:27.200]  from the united states called mexico it came out with their inflation numbers and inflation
[3:34:27.200 --> 3:34:36.960]  at 9.1 percent in the united states it had 8.5 percent or a little over 9 percent it had
[3:34:37.600 --> 3:34:44.000]  i don't know the exact numbers over 9 percent in mexico the numbers came in in the united states
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:35:00.800]  last week it came in at 8.5 mexico's interest rate is 8.5 percent we have roughly the same
[3:35:00.800 --> 3:35:08.880]  we're about a percentage point lower than them on inflation they have an interest rate of 8.5
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:19.600]  percent the us interest rate the overnight rate is 2.25 to 2.50 when our inflation rates
[3:35:20.640 --> 3:35:21.600]  are very similar
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:36.320]  we got it the game is rigged even at these low low low low low interest rate numbers
[3:35:36.320 --> 3:35:41.040]  you're still seeing inflation going up but
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:51.360]  the markets are going up because the money is still cheap it's still cheap at this level
[3:35:52.400 --> 3:35:58.320]  considering the inflation rate so the bigs keep buying up and they keep getting bigger
[3:35:58.320 --> 3:36:07.520]  as i said why do we spend it's between 160 to 180 thousand dollars to educate one person
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:13.120]  from kindergarten to you know k-12 you know in the 12th grade
[3:36:14.560 --> 3:36:20.080]  and what do you do after you get to get out get a job driving an amazon truck now i think i'll

[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:38.720]  i think you're going to home depot but maybe lows is better how about staples cvs wargreen
[3:36:40.400 --> 3:36:45.920]  what are we spending all this money to give people these kind of jobs
[3:36:45.920 --> 3:36:57.520]  what's happened to america low life pieces a scum crap that people call their presidents
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:05.600]  sold out this country when i was a young guy there were no war moths there were no targets
[3:37:05.600 --> 3:37:15.280]  there were no lows at home depot there was a local hardware store local stationary store
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:17.440]  the local drug store
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:24.320]  all the local retailers
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:31.840]  god the bigs have taken off everything they sold us out
[3:37:31.840 --> 3:37:41.200]  do you think goldman sacks would pay a clown like bill clinton who you could hear him shooting his
[3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:48.880]  fat mouth off anytime you want with his arrogant little attitude pay him 300 thousand dollars for
[3:37:48.880 --> 3:37:54.320]  an hour talk oh how about the glass steagle act i forgot about that one that they got rid of
[3:37:54.320 --> 3:38:02.720]  what do you think they pay him this money for morons and imbeciles call it campaign contributions
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:10.000]  adults call it bribes and payoffs matter of fact biden yeah waxed up boosted
[3:38:10.720 --> 3:38:17.760]  covid biden got a million dollars from the borrola group over there phyza that's right
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:23.680]  to celebrate his inauguration that was the maximum they could give him and they gave him that
[3:38:23.680 --> 3:38:28.640]  a million bucks hey hey borrola how about giving occupied peace and a million dollars
[3:38:30.480 --> 3:38:39.200]  so we could keep our peace movement going hey where are you musk how come no money for peace
[3:38:40.320 --> 3:38:46.720]  gates you like the vax how about a buck for peace yeah maybe 50 cents here's the lenty
[3:38:46.720 --> 3:38:58.240]  bazos you don't like peace maybe just like peace is a crap because that's what you created
[3:39:01.920 --> 3:39:09.360]  so going back to this old scheme the markets having crashed because the money flow is still cheap
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:17.360]  when you look at what's going on i mean i just you know in taking a break over here you know
[3:39:17.360 --> 3:39:23.440]  just between breaks when let's see what's going on and when to see nbc stores and suppliers clash
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:28.640]  over price hikes as shoppers hit by sticker shock
[3:39:28.640 --> 3:39:40.320]  yeah long before shoppers filled their carts with hot dogs with detergent supermarkets
[3:39:40.960 --> 3:39:46.560]  and suppliers negotiate and sometimes clash over how much products it cost oh filled your
[3:39:46.560 --> 3:39:53.280]  cart with hot dogs how about filling up your cart with crap i go drive by all the lines going
[3:39:53.280 --> 3:40:01.040]  around pot buys and mcdonalds and holy god could stop i could eat that stuff and drink that stuff
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:07.200]  but again the facts are here the people are getting very hit very hard
[3:40:10.800 --> 3:40:17.600]  those delicate discussions spilled into the public view is summer when crafts hines propose price hikes
[3:40:17.600 --> 3:40:23.680]  as much 30 percent on its foods in the united kingdom according to guardian
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:27.360]  but yet
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:39.280]  just had the biggest military defense budget ever over 60 billion dollars going to ukraine
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:45.040]  as the country goes down the toilet and the reason we're going down the toilet
[3:40:45.040 --> 3:40:52.400]  is we got crap students ahead and that's all they like toilet crap that's what they speak
[3:40:53.200 --> 3:41:00.160]  that's what they eat and that's what they sell we got the toilet bowl mob in charge
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:09.280]  how could anybody with a pea brain bigger than a pea look up to little lindsay graham
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:15.040]  mitch mcconnell nancy polosi chucky schuma
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:18.880]  look at the freak show
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:30.400]  the facts are right here the middle class is shrinking people living paycheck to paycheck
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:37.680]  and more war on the horizon so going back to the markets we're going to see you know
[3:41:37.680 --> 3:41:39.600]  an easing up right now a pressure
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:42.880]  but come
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:51.440]  september that's when you're going to start seeing near the end of september some real volatility
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:58.160]  for two reasons you're buying all the stuff they need for this winter for the christmas holidays
[3:41:59.200 --> 3:42:01.920]  you're back from vacation they see the realities
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:05.840]  and then it starts sinking in
[3:42:07.600 --> 3:42:11.200]  when did the crash of 87 happen it was october

[3:47:51.040 --> 3:47:57.200]  and we want it to be buried because we don't like the truth we sell propaganda like the new
[3:47:57.200 --> 3:48:03.120]  york times the toilet paper of record that guy said i'm saying he got them aluminum tube was he
[3:48:03.120 --> 3:48:10.320]  gonna weapons of mass destruction all you that that place so yeah anyway i've been talking about
[3:48:10.320 --> 3:48:16.720]  the economy and before this far went off the air uh we could break i said about the loss of jobs and
[3:48:16.720 --> 3:48:23.360]  air travel and then i just we took a break over there went back to cnbc looking at the markets
[3:48:24.560 --> 3:48:30.320]  and this is the top one of the top stories business travel spending might not return
[3:48:30.320 --> 3:48:41.280]  to pre-pandemic levels until 2026 this is 2022 that's four years away and this is propaganda by
[3:48:41.280 --> 3:48:47.520]  the way this is what we do in trend research by the way what we do is we analyze the words of each
[3:48:47.520 --> 3:48:57.040]  story to look for the facts as well when you read this business travel spending might not return to
[3:48:57.040 --> 3:49:02.800]  pre-pandemic levels what do you mean pre-pandemic levels we didn't have a pandemic
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:08.080]  we had a scandemic a scandemic
[3:49:11.360 --> 3:49:21.520]  because of what politicians did not what covid did the politicians made up this crap crap heads
[3:49:21.520 --> 3:49:33.040]  who spew out crap the crap that the masses swallow and then hate you for not swallowing it
[3:49:34.240 --> 3:49:42.160]  caused this problem as well as others as i said before we took a break the damage done by the
[3:49:42.160 --> 3:49:51.680]  covid war is incalculable but they're blaming it on the pandemic and not the politicians
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:58.480]  and the health authorities look at these clowns what a bunch of clowns health authorities
[3:49:59.200 --> 3:50:04.560]  what a joke again i was in government i was the assistant to the secretary of the new york state
[3:50:04.560 --> 3:50:12.720]  senate at 26 years old these authorities the clowns that are that are that are the bureaucrats or as i
[3:50:12.720 --> 3:50:18.000]  call them bureaucrats these are these are people that can't get a job in the real world that suck
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:27.760]  into the system so they destroyed us it's not the pandemic that did it no jab no job can't figure
[3:50:27.760 --> 3:50:37.920]  out why you're not getting oh look there he is masked up yep a masquerade can't get any dumber
[3:50:37.920 --> 3:50:45.440]  than these clowns so they're blaming it on the pandemic and it's not the pandemic at all it's
[3:50:45.440 --> 3:50:54.160]  the actions taken by the politicians so going back to this article business travel spending might not
[3:50:54.160 --> 3:51:00.960]  return they say that spending by business travel is a key source of revenue for airlines that's right
[3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:06.080]  that's where they make the big dough now let's put this together more than that how about all the
[3:51:06.080 --> 3:51:12.480]  hotels they go to how about all that they're not going there anymore all the cities that you travel
[3:51:12.480 --> 3:51:16.400]  all the restaurants that used to go to all the meetings that they used to have it's not going
[3:51:16.400 --> 3:51:21.840]  to come back it's going to be more and more zoomed all right listen you don't have to travel
[3:51:21.840 --> 3:51:27.200]  anymore i just saved myself you know eight thousand dollars you know you don't have to go to your
[3:51:27.760 --> 3:51:36.720]  stay over here it's not going to come back they go on to say that there's been an upswing this
[3:51:36.720 --> 3:51:50.880]  year spending worldwide is set to rise nearly 34 in 2022 to $933 billion oh great before the
[3:51:50.880 --> 3:52:03.280]  COVID war in 2019 it was 1.4 trillion and that was with less people and less business this
[3:52:03.280 --> 3:52:14.720]  COVID war has destroyed life in ways that we it's incalculable yep you ready
[3:52:14.720 --> 3:52:20.240]  occupancy was 63 percent
[3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:30.160]  this thing is huge that's where you make your big dough
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:41.280]  and the implications are far and wide that you can't find people working
[3:52:41.280 --> 3:52:47.200]  the report forecast the 42 percent increase in business travel spending in the u.s. this year
[3:52:47.760 --> 3:52:52.320]  from 2021 yep it's still way down
[3:52:55.520 --> 3:53:01.120]  still way way down so the markets are going to go down when the summer vacation's over
[3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:09.920]  with and again talking about they showed that picture of uh Trump getting the shot
[3:53:12.080 --> 3:53:20.560]  Fauci events about Americans opposition to forced masking i saw this on info wars
[3:53:21.600 --> 3:53:28.880]  and it was first on fox dr. Anthony Fauci complained during the talk last tuesday
[3:53:28.880 --> 3:53:38.080]  that many americans see forced masking policies as a violation of their liberties
[3:53:39.520 --> 3:53:47.440]  yeah no kidding hey that face Fauci or i should say freak face is not that fat
[3:53:49.680 --> 3:53:55.920]  you're wearing a mask you're safe while you're bothering me no no you didn't hear me
[3:53:55.920 --> 3:54:03.120]  hey you're wearing a mask and everybody that believes in wearing a mask is wearing a mask
[3:54:04.160 --> 3:54:11.120]  why are you bothering me and trying to steal my freedom and liberty from me

[3:54:33.360 --> 3:54:36.960]  when you tell people they need a mask in an indoor congregation setting
[3:54:37.680 --> 3:54:44.800]  when you're in a zone that has high dynamics of infection that is looked upon by a lot of
[3:54:44.800 --> 3:54:50.400]  people not everybody has an encroachment of your freedom you got it right man and i'll tell
