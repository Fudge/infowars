[00:00.000 --> 00:24.720]  If you are dumbfounded by the motivation to systemically seduce all children into thinking
[00:24.720 --> 00:29.800]  that they can change what sex they are, then it is because you are a more balanced human
[00:29.800 --> 00:30.800]  being.
[00:30.800 --> 00:35.560]  And if you think tricking a child into believing they were born in an accident is evil, then
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.760]  you are likely a person who believes in God, spirit, or love, whichever word you are more
[00:41.760 --> 00:43.600]  comfortable with.
[00:43.600 --> 00:47.520]  When it comes to belief in God, people fall into three categories.
[00:47.520 --> 00:50.880]  The faithful, the agnostic, and the atheist.
[00:50.880 --> 00:57.120]  The faithful believe in God, the atheist doesn't, and the agnostic is open-minded either
[00:57.120 --> 00:58.120]  way.
[00:58.120 --> 01:04.560]  Both the faithful and agnostic can be accepting of this unseen spirit realm, which allows them
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.520]  the ability to strive towards balance with nature, but others are at war with it.
[01:10.520 --> 01:16.600]  The atheist will argue that there is no proof of God, and therefore there is no God, which
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.320]  is nothing more than materialism.
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.560]  The doctrine that nothing exists except for physical matter.
[01:23.560 --> 01:31.000]  Rudolf Steiner described two types of evil within the hearts of man, luciferic and armonic.
[01:31.000 --> 01:36.080]  Luciferic is the evil force that wants to be free of the laws of nature, and armonic
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.920]  wants to obsessively control the laws of nature.
[01:39.920 --> 01:46.360]  We can also describe these energies as satanic and materialistic, while the satanist believes
[01:46.360 --> 01:49.880]  in God and the materialist may not.
[01:49.880 --> 01:56.600]  They both want to dismantle nature and control it, and they are no longer hiding in the shadows.
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.840]  Their radical war against nature is now out in the open for all to see.
[02:01.840 --> 02:10.320]  But control of data might enable human elites to do something even more radical than just
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.640]  build digital dictatorships.
[02:13.640 --> 02:22.080]  By hacking organisms, elites may gain the power to re-engineer the future of life itself.
[02:22.080 --> 02:30.600]  Science is replacing evolution by natural selection with evolution by intelligent design.
[02:30.600 --> 02:37.800]  Not the intelligent design of some god above the clouds, but our intelligent design.
[02:37.800 --> 02:43.920]  The birth of a living human soul comes as a result of the sexual union between a man
[02:43.920 --> 02:45.320]  and a woman.
[02:45.320 --> 02:51.520]  This sexual union is perhaps the most potent spiritual energy that humans can achieve.
[02:51.520 --> 02:57.480]  It is sacred and divine, which is why the evil forces who seek to play God have been
[02:57.480 --> 03:03.480]  subverting it for decades with pornography, abortion, and the welfare system.
[03:03.480 --> 03:09.800]  They seek to replace the mother and father and control this sexual power with technology,
[03:09.800 --> 03:12.600]  making women their number one target.
[03:12.600 --> 03:17.760]  California is introducing a bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to seven
[03:17.760 --> 03:24.600]  days after birth, completely demoralizing what it means to mother a child.
[03:24.600 --> 03:29.720]  And if castrating a man can legally make him a woman, then can mutating a human legally
[03:29.720 --> 03:32.280]  make him non-human?
[03:32.280 --> 03:38.080]  We are discussing whether or not transhumans will qualify for human rights in the future,
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.560]  and with the mother out of the way, who will teach them about love?
[03:42.560 --> 03:48.080]  A child created and raised by the state will be subjected to the authority of the state
[03:48.080 --> 03:50.680]  from birth till death.
[03:50.680 --> 03:56.000]  This is the ultimate goal, and it now seems to be within their grasp.
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.800]  Embryos have been created in laboratories without human sperm or eggs.
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.120]  California's Suzhou Institute of Biomedical Engineering and Technology has created a system
[04:07.120 --> 04:12.520]  to raise human embryos with an artificial intelligence that monitors and adjusts the
[04:12.520 --> 04:17.920]  nutrition, carbon dioxide, and other levels within an artificial womb.
[04:17.920 --> 04:23.160]  The system was originally created to bring the birth rate in China back on track after
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.840]  its disastrous one-child policy, but it's just another step towards dismantling nature
[04:29.840 --> 04:32.360]  and playing God.
[04:32.360 --> 04:37.840]  And so it's good that you see this all as insane, but it would really be great if we
[04:37.840 --> 04:43.040]  could all stop these psychopaths before they kill us all.
[04:43.040 --> 05:10.040]  Coming for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[05:10.040 --> 05:14.120]  The second installment is the Tree of Liberty, Thomas Jefferson Quote must be watered with
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.680]  the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[05:15.680 --> 05:20.880]  It's a coin I designed, I'm very, very proud of it, and it will end up being a collectible.
[05:20.880 --> 05:25.960]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[05:25.960 --> 05:27.280]  we sold it.
[05:27.280 --> 05:32.960]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly, and I appreciate listeners getting
[05:32.960 --> 05:33.960]  over half of them now.
[05:33.960 --> 05:36.080]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[05:36.080 --> 05:41.040]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days, and without the last coin
[05:41.040 --> 05:44.080]  sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.480]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[05:46.480 --> 05:50.440]  So as a limited edition collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom,
[05:50.440 --> 05:54.640]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems, so please give yourself
[05:54.640 --> 06:19.920]  and us aid in the fight against the new rule of order at 1776coin.com.
[06:19.920 --> 06:25.240]  It's Sunday, April 3, 2022.
[06:25.240 --> 06:33.240]  You found it, the embattled info wars, the front lines of the fight for a human future.
[06:33.240 --> 06:39.120]  There's the live show headline, Sunday Live.
[06:39.120 --> 06:45.520]  Disney stock plunges after company endorses pedophilia and grooming of children.
[06:45.520 --> 06:50.720]  Meanwhile, newly released Pfizer docs under court order, proved company purposely covered
[06:50.720 --> 06:56.920]  up deadly effects, they're not side effects, they're meant to happen, of COVID-19 experimental
[06:56.920 --> 07:07.040]  gene therapies, and so much more, like the Ukrainian president, whose band is political
[07:07.040 --> 07:13.160]  parties who has shut down all of the TV stations and radio stations he'd agree with, the dictator
[07:13.160 --> 07:26.160]  was on Fox News Friday and was asked about the video of the battalions, the Nazi battalions,
[07:26.160 --> 07:32.000]  they're wearing the Ukrainian Nazi patches, executing and shooting Russian soldiers in
[07:32.000 --> 07:37.000]  the genitals and kneecaps and feet, and of course they went and found big, large piles
[07:37.000 --> 07:41.480]  of their dead bodies when the Russians were able to take those areas, and what did Zelensky
[07:41.480 --> 07:48.200]  do a week ago, he didn't deny it, he said, yeah, it's a war, well now he said, yes, these
[07:48.200 --> 07:56.800]  units do work for me and that's just what they are doing, he said, quote, they are,
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.160]  what they are.
[08:01.160 --> 08:06.720]  Our corporate media though has been telling us they're no Nazis on his side, even though
[08:06.720 --> 08:13.960]  that's the majority of his main force, vestigial leftovers of World War II, with the big Nazi
[08:13.960 --> 08:20.640]  battles with the Russians centered around Ukraine, but I was on Twitter this morning
[08:20.640 --> 08:26.640]  looking at the post of that and I saw the comments, I read hundreds of them, as I was
[08:26.640 --> 08:31.440]  sitting there eating breakfast, of leftist, well-known big leftist accounts on Twitter
[08:31.440 --> 08:36.600]  saying, well, big deal, it's a war, we got to defeat Putin, so there's the Democratic
[08:36.600 --> 08:43.320]  Party in the left openly working with real Nazis committing war crimes and Zelensky doesn't
[08:43.320 --> 08:50.480]  even deny it, on Fox News, he's being interviewed live and the left is celebrating it, it just
[08:50.480 --> 08:55.120]  shows they're completely amoral and it's all about power and control to them, ladies and
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.440]  gentlemen, just like Jordan Soros is a Nazi collaborator, so they call anyone that doesn't
[08:59.440 --> 09:02.320]  want open borders, anybody that doesn't want to bankrupt the country, anybody that doesn't
[09:02.320 --> 09:09.080]  want election fraud, anybody that doesn't want forced inoculations, a Nazi and then
[09:09.080 --> 09:14.240]  you can't swing a stick in the dark around leftist and globalist and not run into them
[09:14.240 --> 09:20.760]  supporting Nazi-like policies and how many real Nazis are still left alive, not many
[09:20.760 --> 09:28.240]  Jordan Soros, works for the Nazis when he was 14, 15, and 16 and says it was the best
[09:28.240 --> 09:32.800]  time of his life on 60 minutes and if you talk about it, the young Turks call you the
[09:32.800 --> 09:38.720]  worst person in the world talking about yours truly, so let's just hit that first and I'll
[09:38.720 --> 09:43.360]  tell you the other big news, we're going to go through it all here today and again, nothing
[09:43.360 --> 09:49.440]  against the Iron Cross, it's an ancient crusader symbol but when he wears it, the particular
[09:49.440 --> 09:56.160]  Iron Cross he wears is again a symbol of the neo-Nazis in that country and there is Zelensky,
[09:56.160 --> 10:01.520]  they go but he's Jewish, well then it's okay, it's like Soros, oh Soros worked for Hitler,
[10:01.520 --> 10:07.800]  well it's okay, he's Jewish, he told 60 Minutes, he said it's like markets, if I wouldn't have
[10:07.800 --> 10:14.440]  helped the Nazis somebody else would have and so I have no personal blame that I helped
[10:14.440 --> 10:20.400]  them because it's how I survived and see that's the attitude of these soulless globalists,
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.800]  no you should have fought the Nazis but see you didn't and now you run our lives because
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.800]  the establishment went, here's a really evil person who helped round up his own people,
[10:30.800 --> 10:33.600]  let's put him in charge.
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.920]  The patron saint of the left, George Soros, Nazi collaborator and now here's the new
[10:37.920 --> 10:46.360]  patron saint, they literally worship him, sexiest man alive as people, CNN, oh he's Christ like,
[10:46.360 --> 10:53.980]  ABC News, oh he's Winston Churchill 2.0 and here he is saying yeah, we got Nazis in our
[10:53.980 --> 10:59.960]  military, big deal, yeah they commit atrocities, big deal, at the end he says well, some of
[10:59.960 --> 11:07.960]  them got in trouble, some of them had to resign but they later had those resignations overturned,
[11:07.960 --> 11:11.640]  here it is.
[11:11.640 --> 11:17.760]  I want to have you clear something up for us and this is these reports about the Azov
[11:17.760 --> 11:23.360]  battalion that is said to be Nazi affiliated organization operating as a militia in your
[11:23.360 --> 11:27.080]  country said to be committing their own atrocities.
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.760]  What should Americans know about that unit, about those reports?
[11:31.760 --> 11:39.480]  So Azov was one of those many battalions, they are what they are, they were defending
[11:39.480 --> 11:49.560]  our country and later I want to explain to you, everything from all the components of
[11:49.560 --> 11:58.360]  those volunteer battalions later were incorporated into the military of Ukraine.
[11:58.360 --> 12:06.280]  Those Azov fighters are no longer self-established group, they are component of the Ukrainian
[12:06.280 --> 12:13.880]  military, back in 2014 there were situations when our volunteers were encircled and some
[12:13.880 --> 12:20.440]  of them did violate laws, laws of Ukraine and they actually were taken to court and
[12:20.440 --> 12:24.880]  got prison sentences, so law is above all.
[12:24.880 --> 12:31.080]  And of course that was then overturned, the West ran a coup with Soros, he bragged on
[12:31.080 --> 12:36.720]  Verizharkaria CNN in 2015 that he got $5 billion of taxpayer money to overthrow the
[12:36.720 --> 12:42.320]  electric government and start the civil war that has now led to the Russian invasion.
[12:42.320 --> 12:47.400]  So that's just the reality ladies and gentlemen and again, anywhere you get around the left
[12:47.400 --> 12:52.520]  you get euthanasia, you get secret medical testing, you get what can only be described
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.160]  as eugenics and I'm going to move on from that now.
[12:57.160 --> 13:01.280]  I'm going to move on to the economy, I'm going to move on to the mass shooting in Sacramento,
[13:01.280 --> 13:06.880]  I'm going to move on to Kamala Harris and Oliver Gaffes and then some good news, all
[13:06.880 --> 13:11.880]  these top Republicans are coming out against the New World Order and against global government
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.980]  and saying hey, China's a big threat, radical Islam's got a problem but we're mainly worried
[13:18.980 --> 13:22.600]  about the globalist, they're the main problem, they're the enemy.
[13:22.600 --> 13:27.160]  As soon as you recognize that and people start thinking about that as geopolitically, who's
[13:27.160 --> 13:31.840]  coming up against everybody worldwide, all over the world then we can start fixing things
[13:31.840 --> 13:37.360]  and their infiltrators, we've penetrates their cabinets, we control half the cabinets of
[13:37.360 --> 13:38.360]  the earth.
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.760]  I mean, they're announcing that they've penetrated our governments and control them and all these
[13:42.760 --> 13:47.520]  world leaders spout the slogans of the world economic forum.
[13:47.520 --> 13:53.520]  We identify that in this game over as Klaus Schwab would say, you're going to own nothing,
[13:53.520 --> 13:54.520]  you're going to have nothing.
[13:54.520 --> 13:57.560]  Well, I say Klaus Schwab, you're going to be in a super max prison, you're going to
[13:57.560 --> 14:00.040]  own nothing and have nothing and you're going to hate it.
[14:00.040 --> 14:04.640]  As long as we just get out of the daydream, out of the hoax and realize we're in the real
[14:04.640 --> 14:06.760]  world we can beat these people.
[14:06.760 --> 14:10.600]  And so my main mission for 28 years on there has been to expose the globalists, it's finally
[14:10.600 --> 14:14.920]  happening thanks to all of us together, big stack.
[14:14.920 --> 14:20.080]  Senator Paul comes out at the anti-globalism summit, Senator Rand Paul at the Globalism
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.120]  Rising event at Regent University, we've got that, we've got all these other prominent
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.120]  top people coming out and we've got Dr. Malone coming out.
[14:28.120 --> 14:33.560]  I mean, it's just so refreshing to know who our enemy is.
[14:33.560 --> 14:36.520]  You know as a listener, a lot of you before you ever heard of me.
[14:36.520 --> 14:40.560]  But the general public still doesn't know why their gas prices are up, they still don't
[14:40.560 --> 14:44.160]  know why we're at war with Russia, they still don't know why trans-generisms being forced
[14:44.160 --> 14:49.800]  down on children everywhere because it is a trans-humanist operation and the whole trans
[14:49.800 --> 14:53.880]  movement is just the tip of that spear.
[14:53.880 --> 14:58.120]  And then we've got unbelievable evidence of Disney promoting pedophilia and more as their
[14:58.120 --> 15:01.120]  stock plunges, just a huge stack there.
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.360]  And as I mentioned, the massive niche on Pfizer, remember six months ago, federal court ordered
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.120]  them, a great federal judge in Texas, ordered them to release the documents and they kept
[15:12.120 --> 15:17.160]  refusing so he started sanctioning them so they released them blacked out.
[15:17.160 --> 15:21.000]  Now they ordered them released un-blacked out and it's them, what do you think's in
[15:21.000 --> 15:22.240]  the blacked out areas?
[15:22.240 --> 15:26.400]  Well, you know what's in there, right?
[15:26.400 --> 15:33.920]  They knew it was causing major autoimmune disorders and major sicknesses and even death,
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.520]  A-D-E is just one of the things.
[15:38.520 --> 15:42.720]  So it's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, on this live Sunday show.
[15:42.720 --> 15:47.400]  Remember, the enemies of freedom work around the clock to keep you and your family and
[15:47.400 --> 15:48.800]  others from hearing the truth.
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.920]  So when you share the links from man.video and battleplan.news and infowars.com, it's
[15:53.920 --> 15:55.420]  a revolutionary act.
[15:55.420 --> 15:59.120]  Quick action now so everybody you know, tune in.
[15:59.120 --> 16:07.360]  In December of 2021, infowars offered the first in a three-part series, the 1776 Anti-Tyrant
[16:07.360 --> 16:10.640]  Coin and it sold out in 10 days.
[16:10.640 --> 16:15.200]  And if it wasn't for listeners getting this original, powerful coin, a founding member
[16:15.200 --> 16:18.640]  coin, we would not be on air today.
[16:18.640 --> 16:23.960]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[16:23.960 --> 16:26.000]  out in 10 days again.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.480]  It certainly needs to be front of operation.
[16:28.480 --> 16:33.520]  It is so historic and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty
[16:33.520 --> 16:37.400]  being refreshed with the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more.
[16:37.400 --> 16:41.400]  See the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com.
[16:41.400 --> 16:43.640]  It's also at infowars.com.
[16:43.640 --> 16:44.640]  It's amazing.
[16:44.640 --> 16:49.160]  There's only 10,000 of them and as a founding member, we're able to stay on the air.
[16:49.160 --> 16:54.440]  We're planning something very, very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level.
[16:54.440 --> 16:59.080]  So get your new Tree of Liberty coin while you still can at 1776coin.com.
[16:59.080 --> 17:04.400]  The first 10 amendments to our country's constitution were adopted in 1791.
[17:04.400 --> 17:09.320]  The first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech and free press.
[17:09.320 --> 17:15.560]  Free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship, interference
[17:15.560 --> 17:18.360]  and restraint by the government.
[17:18.360 --> 17:24.720]  131 years later, free speech across America is under chronic and insidious attack.

[19:18.360 --> 19:22.080]  top of it, it funds the InfoWars so that's the 360 win.

[19:31.080 --> 19:33.560]  loatium root, and more.

[19:35.480 --> 19:40.880]  InfoWars immune support exclusively available at InfoWarsTour.com is funding the tip of
[19:40.880 --> 19:43.200]  the spear, the InfoWars operation.
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.560]  It is a 360 win.
[19:44.560 --> 19:49.040]  The only way you fail is by not taking action and getting this product to boost your body's
[19:49.040 --> 19:51.640]  natural defenses and keep InfoWars on the air.
[19:51.640 --> 19:54.080]  The globalists are hoping you don't take action.
[19:54.080 --> 20:06.960]  Take action now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[20:24.080 --> 20:49.520]  Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, in the next segment, I'm going to break down some very
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.240]  positive good news as the world awakens the real threat to globalists.
[20:54.240 --> 20:59.000]  I wanted to hit now what they're actually doing to us on the economic front and then
[20:59.000 --> 21:03.520]  with the poison injections, masquerading as vaccines.
[21:03.520 --> 21:07.880]  And I know this horrible news is very frightening, very disgusting.
[21:07.880 --> 21:12.040]  You don't want to admit it to yourself, but they're counting on us all being naive and
[21:12.040 --> 21:14.400]  not facing up to this real evil.
[21:14.400 --> 21:19.640]  As Christians or just as people that love justice, we can all unify together of every
[21:19.640 --> 21:25.640]  race, color, and creed and say no to this or civilization as we know it is over.
[21:25.640 --> 21:29.960]  And I'll get to those headlines just in a moment.
[21:29.960 --> 21:36.480]  Please remember that InfoWars is more important now than it's ever been.
[21:36.480 --> 21:39.400]  Our most important work is being done right now because everything we've talked about
[21:39.400 --> 21:41.000]  unfortunately is now here.
[21:41.000 --> 21:46.320]  I thought we could expose it, really push against it and stop it.
[21:46.320 --> 21:49.920]  They're still going ahead with their operation and now everything we've talked about is unfolding
[21:49.920 --> 21:54.440]  exactly as we said because I'm going off their own statements, their own battle plans and
[21:54.440 --> 21:59.300]  all the expert guests we've interviewed over the years.
[21:59.300 --> 22:04.360]  So our most important work ever is being done right now.
[22:04.360 --> 22:07.080]  And two minutes to midnight, the world is awakening.
[22:07.080 --> 22:12.840]  So please understand that the Democratic Party, the corrupt establishment, the Justice Department
[22:12.840 --> 22:18.080]  they control, all of these powerful forces are attacking us and are on our ass right
[22:18.080 --> 22:21.800]  now on our six trying to take us down.
[22:21.800 --> 22:27.080]  We need your prayers, we need your word of mouth, and we need your financial support.
[22:27.080 --> 22:28.440]  I'm making it very easy.
[22:28.440 --> 22:33.440]  We've done major accounting around here to try to find out ways to not downsize, to not
[22:33.440 --> 22:39.560]  lay people off, to pay for the massive bandwidth with up to 6, 7, 8 million, well up to 10
[22:39.560 --> 22:45.040]  million a day, on average 7 million people a day that watch videos and band out video
[22:45.040 --> 22:46.520]  alone for free.
[22:46.520 --> 22:50.520]  Or the millions that tune in over our audio and video streams here on air, or the millions
[22:50.520 --> 22:54.320]  that tune in over AM and FM, thank God we don't have to pay for that, the stations pick
[22:54.320 --> 22:55.320]  it up.
[22:55.320 --> 23:01.640]  But the bandwidth cost, all of it is crazy and I need funds to fight this war.
[23:01.640 --> 23:05.920]  So I thank you all for your support, and I appreciate you and your prayers, and I ask
[23:05.920 --> 23:08.080]  you to go to infowarstore.com.
[23:08.080 --> 23:12.480]  We did our own research, finally people kept telling me, Alex you should sell your t-shirts.
[23:12.480 --> 23:16.840]  Alex, you keep ordering t-shirt designs, but you never promote them.
[23:16.840 --> 23:24.440]  And so we had over 200 t-shirt designs, 63,000 of them on Wednesday.
[23:24.440 --> 23:29.160]  Some of them here for three, four years, half our warehouse full of them, it was finally
[23:29.160 --> 23:33.240]  the warehouse crew said, sir, you don't have room in the warehouse for other products because
[23:33.240 --> 23:36.360]  half of its t-shirts, you need to get rid of these.
[23:36.360 --> 23:40.280]  A lot of these, I've never even promoted, they're awesome.
[23:40.280 --> 23:46.600]  So I started telling you about this on Thursday, the good news is 10,000 shirts have been sold
[23:46.600 --> 23:52.440]  and that vital money has come in, and now we're going to sell the other 50 plus thousand
[23:52.440 --> 23:57.480]  we have left, hopefully in the next few weeks listeners have come through like never before,
[23:57.480 --> 24:04.480]  go to infowarstheese.com, infowarstheese.com, and that takes you right to the sub page at
[24:04.480 --> 24:11.440]  infowarstore.com to find the t-shirts, the only and ball caps and flags and so much more.
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.160]  The only hassle is there's hundreds of them, so you'll have to scroll through to find what
[24:15.160 --> 24:16.720]  you want, but thank you.
[24:16.720 --> 24:22.520]  And oh, I forgot the most important part, we are selling them at cost, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:22.520 --> 24:27.640]  We're talking shirts that cost us 15 bucks to make, 17 bucks, because there's added handling
[24:27.640 --> 24:29.280]  them and dealing with it.
[24:29.280 --> 24:34.680]  Shirt costs $5, it's $7, a ball cap costs us $9, it's $11.
[24:34.680 --> 24:39.360]  We are selling these at cost because we've got to move them out to fund the operation,
[24:39.360 --> 24:44.960]  the beautiful part is it'll flood the world, the third dimension with all these great t-shirts.
[24:44.960 --> 24:51.240]  So many, so many really funny t-shirts, serious t-shirts, beautiful t-shirts, great designs,
[24:51.240 --> 24:56.200]  baby lives matter, my wife loves that Biden shirt where it shows two hands on a woman's
[24:56.200 --> 25:02.440]  shirt, grabbing the woman, that people love the military info wars symbol shirt, so many
[25:02.440 --> 25:10.320]  things, the classic info wars, bright red on navy blue in your face, that's, oh, and
[25:10.320 --> 25:13.240]  one more point that I'm done talking about this.
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.480]  Last point on this and I'm done talking about it, I'm going to get to the news, but that's
[25:16.480 --> 25:20.440]  how you fund tip of the spear news that nobody else is hearing, because everybody else gets
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.640]  attacked or shut down or bought off, we can't be bought off, but we can be shut down if
[25:24.640 --> 25:25.640]  we don't have funds.
[25:25.640 --> 25:32.680]  The last part, there's over 200 designs and even though some of these designs are 25,
[25:32.680 --> 25:38.160]  26 years old, like mass murderers agree gun control work shirt, when they're gone I'm
[25:38.160 --> 25:43.120]  never reprinting any of these designs again.
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.640]  Oh, look at that, beautiful, scroll down a little bit, scroll down, up, up, up the other
[25:48.640 --> 25:55.000]  way, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, look at that beautiful classic, that's a shirt that's
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.360]  top flight, look at that 13 original colony snake, nobody else has got that design, join
[26:02.360 --> 26:07.640]  or die snake, that is a designer shirt that I know, back when we printed it, costs us
[26:07.640 --> 26:13.840]  like $15 a piece, that is a top end designer shirt for 20 something bucks, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:13.840 --> 26:19.840]  when it's gone, it is gone, gone, gone, and speaking of beautiful, let's go back, you
[26:19.840 --> 26:26.120]  got Leanne McAdoo underneath that, wearing the women's gold foil shirt, that is so awesome,
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.840]  my wife loves that one as well, we've got men's and women's, but it's a gold foil women's
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.680]  shirt, and again, we're selling that shirt, it's a designer shirt at cost at infowarstore.com.
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.960]  So when these shirts are gone, ladies and gentlemen, they are gone forever because I'm
[26:42.960 --> 26:46.840]  in war mode, I'm clearing, I'm getting rid of everything, I'm just throwing everything
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.920]  into the fight, everything into the bandwidth, everything into the crew, and we may, if we
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.880]  stabilize things in the future, have maybe a shirt or two at a time that are designer
[26:55.880 --> 26:59.880]  that are original, and then kind of a popular low cost shirt for getting the word out that's
[26:59.880 --> 27:04.720]  at cost, so we're going to have shirts in the future, but no more than three designs
[27:04.720 --> 27:08.800]  at one time, they'll all be limited edition, so over 200 designs, some of which that have
[27:08.800 --> 27:16.560]  been around for 25, 26 years, I designed on, what's that called, as long as I used it,
[27:16.560 --> 27:22.920]  Photoshop, over, let me see, my son's 19 years old, I was a couple years before he was born,
[27:22.920 --> 27:26.880]  more than 20 years ago I designed our first shirt, and it was the mass murderers agree
[27:26.880 --> 27:32.400]  shirt, and I remember how slow Photoshop was, putting a picture of Hitler stalling and
[27:32.400 --> 27:37.080]  Mao on it, and then saying mass murderers agree, gun control works, on the back, politicians
[27:37.080 --> 27:42.400]  love disarm peasants, we've sold over 100,000 of that t-shirt, no last 20 plus years, it's
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.400]  gone as well, everything, there will not be one, not the tyranny response team shirts,
[27:47.400 --> 27:54.200]  none of them, none of these will ever be available, I need the 500 plus, 600 plus, thousand dollars
[27:54.200 --> 27:58.080]  into my operation now to pay for bandwidth and crew, because I'm not going to lay these
[27:58.080 --> 28:04.720]  people off, and we were out of money as of last week, and I'm dumping in my final savings,
[28:04.720 --> 28:07.960]  which is very liberating and feels good, all these leftist Democrats think they're going
[28:07.960 --> 28:12.680]  to try to win their fake lawsuits and rig courts and get money, it's very liberating at this
[28:12.680 --> 28:18.200]  point to be putting everything into the fight, I normally do 10 minute plugs, but I'm just
[28:18.200 --> 28:23.360]  ranting because it's such an insane time, infowarstheese.com, and the current sales
[28:23.360 --> 28:27.840]  rates, it will be sold out by next Thursday or Friday, we have the second and the three
[28:27.840 --> 28:34.920]  part series of the Liberty Coin, the Liberty Tree Coin at 1776coin.com and it helps fund
[28:34.920 --> 28:39.440]  us staying on air and some secret operations that will announce in the near future that
[28:39.440 --> 28:44.840]  founding members will get exclusive, first use of and big discounts that basically end
[28:44.840 --> 28:48.400]  up saving you the cost of the coin if we're able to stay on air, no guarantees because
[28:48.400 --> 28:53.400]  who knows, we're in a war, but these are founding member coins, second and the three part series
[28:53.400 --> 28:59.280]  is going to be sold out very, very soon, 1776coin.com.
[28:59.280 --> 29:06.960]  In December of 2021, infowarsthe offered the first in a three part series, the 1776 anti
[29:06.960 --> 29:12.440]  tyrant coin, and it's sold out in 10 days, and if it wasn't for listeners getting this
[29:12.440 --> 29:18.640]  original, powerful coin, a founding member coin, we would not be on air today.
[29:18.640 --> 29:24.160]  Now the second coin, the Liberty Tree Coin is being offered and it will probably sell
[29:24.160 --> 29:30.520]  out in 10 days, again, it certainly needs to the front of operation, it is so historic
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.480]  and it has a quote from Thomas Jefferson about the Tree of Liberty being refreshed with
[29:34.480 --> 29:41.600]  the blood of Patriots and Tyrants and more, see the coin for yourself at 1776coin.com,

[32:57.400 --> 33:01.200]  Thank you for your support.
[33:01.200 --> 33:28.040]  Speaking of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.040 --> 33:32.200]  I want to thank God for all my blessings, I want to thank God for my family and this
[33:32.200 --> 33:36.080]  country and this world and the great crew I've got, I want to thank God Almighty for
[33:36.080 --> 33:39.200]  all of you, I mean it.
[33:39.200 --> 33:43.720]  I am so blessed to be able to fight these people, I'm so blessed to be here on air talking
[33:43.720 --> 33:48.000]  to all of you, because at the end of the day all that matters is about our free will and
[33:48.000 --> 33:52.520]  the choices we make in this universe and not failing this task right now.
[33:52.520 --> 33:58.680]  Okay, let me race through this news and break down what's unfolding and happening.
[33:58.680 --> 34:03.840]  The first clip I want to get to is Dr. Robert Malone, the inventor of mRNA technology,
[34:03.840 --> 34:08.120]  very successful, very wealthy guy with a bunch of patents, worked for many of the top companies
[34:08.120 --> 34:14.040]  in the world and he started warning them two years ago, this mRNA is not good for vaccines,
[34:14.040 --> 34:18.720]  you've already done studies on animals, it causes ADE and blood clots and death, what
[34:18.720 --> 34:19.720]  are you doing?
[34:19.720 --> 34:23.960]  One of the other top scientists, the former chief scientist at Pfizer, he just retired
[34:23.960 --> 34:29.600]  a year before all this, Dr. Michael Yidon, he came out and said, wrote emergency papers
[34:29.600 --> 34:36.520]  and followed lawsuits in the EU with Dr. Wolfgang Wudarg predicting everything that happened.
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.040]  But then you got the document from the CDC in October of 2020 where they were predicting
[34:41.040 --> 34:47.400]  it all, remember, because this is known stuff, this is known stuff.
[34:47.400 --> 34:51.760]  And so as that process unfolded, you can see the full speech he gave that's 25 minutes
[34:51.760 --> 34:57.960]  long on infowars.com, he then did the research on why are they doing this and found out it's
[34:57.960 --> 34:59.960]  a total depopulation takeover.
[34:59.960 --> 35:03.760]  In fact, let's put that back on screen, great job, the crew put that article up.
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.000]  Please everyone, care about yourself, care about your family, I know you know what's
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.360]  going on but do people in your neighborhood know?
[35:09.360 --> 35:14.680]  You better warn them, give them a printout of the article from infowars and ask them
[35:14.680 --> 35:18.920]  to go visit it, just because it's banned in cyberspace doesn't mean you can't send to
[35:18.920 --> 35:20.240]  the URL.
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.640]  Global fascism, Dr. Malone breaks down the World Economic Forum's globalist agenda and
[35:25.640 --> 35:33.680]  here's the good news, whether it is Joe Rogan or whether it's his guest or Tucker Carlson
[35:33.680 --> 35:39.000]  or whether it is a lot of these other prominent scientists or whether it's Senator Paul or
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.080]  Josh Senator Holly or Senator Cruz, they're all talking about globalists in the new world
[35:44.080 --> 35:50.680]  order and their plan and how the transgenderism and the world IDs and the forced inoculations
[35:50.680 --> 35:54.640]  is them and I know as an audience you're like, yeah, we know, we've known before you were
[35:54.640 --> 35:58.480]  on air, most of you, a lot of you were, you know, before I was born knew this.
[35:58.480 --> 36:00.960]  I know Barry Goldwater knew about this 60 years ago.
[36:00.960 --> 36:06.200]  I know Ron Paul knew about it 50 years ago, before I was born, I know that.
[36:06.200 --> 36:12.400]  The public doesn't know but the fact is the enemies out in the open, last week it ended
[36:12.400 --> 36:18.280]  Friday, they had a five day conference in Dubai put on by the World Economic Forum called
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.080]  World Government Conference where they announced total takeover of the planet and now they're
[36:23.080 --> 36:24.600]  going to end humans as we know it.
[36:24.600 --> 36:29.400]  I have the damn clips, plate of all week.
[36:29.400 --> 36:35.040]  And so you know all about this but your neighbor doesn't know, your pastor doesn't know the
[36:35.040 --> 36:39.440]  lady that cuts your hair or the man that fixes your car or the farmer down the street.
[36:39.440 --> 36:43.480]  They don't know.
[36:43.480 --> 36:49.800]  And if we don't get our leaders of every color and every race and every creed and religion
[36:49.800 --> 36:55.600]  to understand this transhuman thing is like an alien, in fact it calls itself alien.
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.480]  It says it's taking over the human species, whether it's run by some gray alien flying
[37:00.480 --> 37:09.840]  around in a tinfoil saucer or whether it's run by a demon, whatever it is, it's happening.
[37:09.840 --> 37:14.680]  We started the show with the Gregory's report at the Davos group up there on a big stage,
[37:14.680 --> 37:16.680]  100 foot ceilings.
[37:16.680 --> 37:23.040]  Hell, 200 foot ceilings looks like saying the age of humans is over, we're taking you
[37:23.040 --> 37:28.240]  over, you have no more freedom, you have no more mobility, I mean it's like worse than
[37:28.240 --> 37:35.240]  the Borg in the 1990s when they show up and John Luke McCartney say, you will be assimilated,
[37:35.240 --> 37:38.920]  we are the Borg, you cannot resist, resistance is futile.
[37:38.920 --> 37:45.360]  Here's the Davos group literally saying resistance is futile.
[37:45.360 --> 37:49.160]  And by the way, we're not even going to let you be absorbed, we're going to kill you,
[37:49.160 --> 37:51.080]  there's too many people.
[37:51.080 --> 37:52.680]  They say that.
[37:52.680 --> 38:00.400]  And you're asking why are they suddenly announcing it, well that's the $64 trillion question.
[38:00.400 --> 38:06.000]  Because they've got to act powerful in front of all their minions and sign on to the cult
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.400]  to believe, well they must be about to win, I mean they're up there bragging about it
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.640]  on TV and the general public said a transit doesn't know, maybe the public deserves to
[38:14.640 --> 38:15.640]  die.
[38:15.640 --> 38:23.640]  You know, William Shatner was given a speech, he talked about it.
[38:23.640 --> 38:28.680]  So here's Dr. Malone discussing globalism at a major conference and in this particular
[38:28.680 --> 38:32.280]  speech he was talking to 50,000 people, here it is.
[38:32.280 --> 38:34.160]  So what comes out on the other side?
[38:34.160 --> 38:43.480]  It really depends on whether or not people value freedom and autonomy, personal autonomy,
[38:43.480 --> 38:46.840]  conscious medical autonomy, of course globally.
[38:46.840 --> 38:53.000]  And are they willing to step up to the bar and fight for it?
[38:53.000 --> 39:03.320]  Or are they okay with becoming serfs in a techno-fascist situation where the financial,
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.680]  global financial elite control everything you do, everything you can buy, everything
[39:08.680 --> 39:11.480]  you can think, everything you can eat.
[39:11.480 --> 39:12.480]  Is that what you want?
[39:12.480 --> 39:14.360]  Is that the world you want to live in?
[39:14.360 --> 39:17.960]  Is that the world you want for your children?
[39:17.960 --> 39:20.600]  That's what's in today's care.
[39:20.600 --> 39:22.480]  And by the way, the crew does the best job ever.
[39:22.480 --> 39:25.680]  I send them like hundreds of clips a day and stuff gets confused.
[39:25.680 --> 39:29.080]  There's another clip of him giving a big speech a few days ago where he basically says the
[39:29.080 --> 39:30.080]  same thing.
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.200]  So I send them a bunch of links, that's what they got, I hadn't seen that, that's something
[39:33.200 --> 39:34.200]  separate.
[39:34.200 --> 39:37.880]  So there's just so much, so much going on.
[39:37.880 --> 39:45.160]  Let me get back to world leaders and major scientists and speakers and Rand Paul talking
[39:45.160 --> 39:47.740]  about what's currently happening and who our enemies are in a moment.
[39:47.740 --> 39:51.800]  But let's look at some of the things they're doing to us first.
[39:51.800 --> 39:52.800]  Here's CNN.
[39:52.800 --> 39:57.120]  Now you heard me in the last two years say their plan is to start killing the dollar.
[39:57.120 --> 40:00.440]  Here's a big story out of CNN this weekend.
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.720]  Is the dollar in danger?
[40:03.720 --> 40:05.240]  And it says yes, it's in danger.
[40:05.240 --> 40:11.120]  In fact, it was 90% just 20 years ago of world reserve currency.
[40:11.120 --> 40:13.440]  Now it's 60%.
[40:13.440 --> 40:14.440]  And guess what?
[40:14.440 --> 40:18.320]  Two years ago, it was 70% roughly.
[40:18.320 --> 40:28.720]  So most of that loss from 90 to 60 is accelerating.
[40:28.720 --> 40:31.720]  You got your loss going kind of slow here.
[40:31.720 --> 40:37.080]  Now it's going like that.
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.600]  So you've seen the graphs out there that in the first year of Biden's administration,
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.680]  the dollar lost 30% of its value.
[40:45.680 --> 40:47.200]  That was just in the first eight months.
[40:47.200 --> 40:48.880]  Now it's half its value.
[40:48.880 --> 40:53.440]  So it already lost a bunch of its value, but what it had left in the last year, it lost
[40:53.440 --> 40:58.280]  more than half.
[40:58.280 --> 41:02.000]  Now folks, I know everybody's kind of got short attention spans.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  I know I do too.
[41:03.000 --> 41:04.640]  We're kind of in the moment, everything.
[41:04.640 --> 41:09.280]  But I mean, when I go to sleep at night, I'm worried about stuff.
[41:09.280 --> 41:10.280]  I'm worried about this.
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.280]  Because let me tell you something, the dollar goes belly up, which is happening.
[41:15.280 --> 41:18.400]  It's dying slowly though, like grandma.
[41:18.400 --> 41:21.560]  Grandma looks pretty sick as she might die in a month later she's dead.
[41:21.560 --> 41:22.560]  That's the dollar.
[41:22.560 --> 41:23.560]  But here's the thing.
[41:23.560 --> 41:29.280]  Guys, you just go bury it in the ground and feel sorry for it and go to her wake or whatever
[41:29.280 --> 41:32.640]  and eat some pie or remember how great she was.
[41:32.640 --> 41:40.200]  When the dollar dies, you're purchasing power dies and you become impoverished because we're
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.120]  not a multi-crop economy.
[41:42.120 --> 41:44.640]  We're not thousands of industries like we used to be.
[41:44.640 --> 41:45.840]  We're not resilient.
[41:45.840 --> 41:48.160]  We're not farmers anymore.
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.000]  And when we lose the dollar, when every bit of power we've got is based in that.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.440]  And CNN admits it in an article.
[41:54.440 --> 42:00.600]  It says the US may have the world's most powerful military, but the dollar is its greatest weapon.
[42:00.600 --> 42:06.080]  Now after nearly 80 years of dollar dominance, the US might be in danger of losing the world
[42:06.080 --> 42:09.480]  reserve status.
[42:09.480 --> 42:12.040]  But you don't tune in to see what CNN's saying.
[42:12.040 --> 42:17.840]  You tune in to hear what our listeners and our guests and callers and myself have to
[42:17.840 --> 42:19.240]  say.
[42:19.240 --> 42:22.640]  Why is it losing its world reserve currency?
[42:22.640 --> 42:24.240]  What caused that?
[42:24.240 --> 42:25.600]  Who did that?
[42:25.600 --> 42:27.680]  And then you see the policies.
[42:27.680 --> 42:32.720]  If you had a checklist of 20 things to screw the dollar and destroy America, I mean, they're
[42:32.720 --> 42:34.480]  not just checking them off.
[42:34.480 --> 42:40.320]  If there's little check boxes, they are stabbing them with daggers.
[42:40.320 --> 42:41.720]  They want to check them off so hard.
[42:41.720 --> 42:48.720]  I mean, they're just like, ah, kill it, kill it, kill it, go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, I mean,
[42:48.720 --> 42:52.000]  that's what your government's doing is everything you can to destroy your country.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.600]  Your dollar, your children, your borders, your future, your rights, your freedoms.
[42:56.600 --> 42:57.600]  They're the enemy.
[42:57.600 --> 42:58.600]  They're not Americans.
[42:58.600 --> 43:06.960]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three-part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[43:06.960 --> 43:08.920]  or m4store.com.
[43:08.920 --> 43:11.360]  And the second installment is the Tree of Liberty.
[43:11.360 --> 43:14.840]  Thomas Jefferson, quote, must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[43:14.840 --> 43:15.840]  It's a coin I designed.
[43:15.840 --> 43:17.160]  I'm very, very proud of it.
[43:17.160 --> 43:19.800]  And it will end up being a collectible.
[43:19.800 --> 43:24.880]  I know that the first coin is already selling on eBay and other places for three times what
[43:24.880 --> 43:26.200]  we sold it.
[43:26.200 --> 43:29.280]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly.
[43:29.280 --> 43:32.920]  And I appreciate listeners getting over half of them now.
[43:32.920 --> 43:35.000]  I'd like to move them out very quickly.
[43:35.000 --> 43:38.680]  I think they will sell out probably in five or six more days.
[43:38.680 --> 43:43.040]  And without the last coin sale, we would not be operating at the same capacity.
[43:43.040 --> 43:45.400]  We would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems.
[43:45.400 --> 43:49.280]  So it was a limited edition collectible tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom.
[43:49.280 --> 43:52.440]  And it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems.
[43:52.440 --> 43:59.800]  So please give yourself and us aid in the fight against the new world order at 1776coin.com.
[43:59.800 --> 44:08.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, m4store.com is offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history.
[44:08.720 --> 44:13.640]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.440]  are broken down and in full wars is having serious trouble making it's payroll and paying
[44:19.440 --> 44:20.440]  for operations.
[44:20.440 --> 44:24.560]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their
[44:24.560 --> 44:26.400]  main move in full wars.
[44:26.400 --> 44:27.400]  It's paradoxical.
[44:27.400 --> 44:28.400]  It's more popular than ever.
[44:28.400 --> 44:33.640]  It is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship, but because of cost increasing
[44:33.640 --> 44:36.960]  and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth, everything else,
[44:36.960 --> 44:39.120]  we are running out of money.
[44:39.120 --> 44:46.280]  So listen up to 75% off m4store.com on things like amazing patriot t-shirts that help spread
[44:46.280 --> 44:53.240]  the word and fund the operation on supplements, on books, on films, everything is 25 to 75%
[44:53.240 --> 44:54.240]  off right now.
[44:54.240 --> 44:57.680]  The biggest sell in our history at m4store.com.
[44:57.680 --> 44:58.680]  Thank you for your support.
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.960]  Folks, I only bring you things I believe in and what David Sinclair and Volta Wireless
[45:03.960 --> 45:05.520]  have created is game changing.
[45:05.520 --> 45:10.620]  Go to VoltaWireless.com, use promo code Alex, get a big discount signing up to their virtual
[45:10.620 --> 45:15.680]  sim or they'll send you a sim card or your cell phone that uses machine to machine communications
[45:15.680 --> 45:20.440]  and triple layered encryption to defeat all these different surveillance systems.
[45:20.440 --> 45:21.720]  This is the future.
[45:21.720 --> 45:23.440]  So I appreciate David Sinclair.
[45:23.440 --> 45:27.240]  He is a former telecommunications and tech industry executive is now the founder and
[45:27.240 --> 45:34.360]  CEO of Volta Wireless, VoltaWireless.com, promo code Alex to get a big discount on signing
[45:34.360 --> 45:35.360]  up.
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.760]  So VoltaWireless began with the idea of we want people to be free and so we want them
[45:39.760 --> 45:41.320]  to be able to have their privacy back.
[45:41.320 --> 45:44.320]  So the first thing we looked at is what's the most important thing in free speech?
[45:44.320 --> 45:45.320]  It's free communication.
[45:45.320 --> 45:47.320]  The ability to share information with one another.
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.440]  So the first thing we did was we worked on an encrypted messenger and as we've seen everybody
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.480]  last year was talking about how signal was the biggest thing for secure communications.
[45:56.480 --> 45:57.840]  You need to get an encrypted messenger.
[45:57.840 --> 45:58.840]  You go get signal.
[45:58.840 --> 46:00.840]  Signal uses basic end to end encryption.
[46:00.840 --> 46:04.640]  They're using an open source piece of code and lo and behold, we discovered of course
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.080]  that the FBI and frankly other government agencies have figured out how to hack that
[46:08.080 --> 46:09.080]  code.
[46:09.080 --> 46:11.760]  You know the next step then is how do you improve upon that?
[46:11.760 --> 46:16.400]  Well we developed our own encrypted messenger which allows you to do calls, messaging, file
[46:16.400 --> 46:20.520]  transfer and also voice and video calls both with up to a thousand people at the same time
[46:20.520 --> 46:23.960]  and it uses three layers of 256 bit encryption.
[46:23.960 --> 46:24.960]  That's huge I'm told.
[46:24.960 --> 46:25.960]  Oh yeah.
[46:25.960 --> 46:26.960]  Three layers.
[46:26.960 --> 46:27.960]  So three layers.
[46:27.960 --> 46:32.920]  Two 256 bit encryption is what the NSA uses to communicate top secret materials.
[46:32.920 --> 46:39.000]  Three layers of 256 bit encryption, it takes every super computer in the world more than
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.200]  a million years to break through three layers of 256 bit encryption.
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.040]  Essentially the computing power does not exist in the world today to hack through that.
[46:47.040 --> 46:48.440]  You're doing trailblazing stuff.
[46:48.440 --> 46:50.360]  People should really go there now.
[46:50.360 --> 47:00.240]  Even an idiot like me can sign up for VoltaWireList.com, promo code Alex and sports broadcast.
[47:00.240 --> 47:06.240]  Including a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.240 --> 47:38.680]  Thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[47:38.680 --> 47:45.000]  Chrissy Lee is going to take over at 6 p.m. this evening for two hours of powerful radio
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.640]  slash TV with reboting guests and information but I'm going to be here for the next hour
[47:50.640 --> 47:55.040]  and 13 minutes or so.
[47:55.040 --> 47:58.840]  And I'm a little bit behind because I've been ranting and preaching tonight but I've
[47:58.840 --> 48:01.360]  already hit maybe 5% of the news we have here.
[48:01.360 --> 48:10.280]  So forgive me if I spent a lot of the last segment freaking out over CNN, having an extremely
[48:10.280 --> 48:18.200]  accurate article about the end of the dollar and what that means to you and your family
[48:18.200 --> 48:21.000]  because it's bad.
[48:21.000 --> 48:30.400]  Use the U.S. dollar in danger, battleground, state, Democrats panic over Biden ending Trump
[48:30.400 --> 48:33.680]  era border controls, a frightening decision.
[48:33.680 --> 48:40.520]  You think the border was broken, it's totally broken now, millions pouring across every
[48:40.520 --> 48:43.400]  month.
[48:43.400 --> 48:50.840]  As predicted, record illegal alien surge begins, border agents force to use proper LGBTQ
[48:50.840 --> 48:55.280]  I pronouns, yes.
[48:55.280 --> 49:02.360]  Tucker Carlson, who's profiting from Biden's energy crisis, Democrats, of course.
[49:02.360 --> 49:08.360]  Biden administration reverses Trump fuel efficiency rules, new vehicles must average 49 miles
[49:08.360 --> 49:14.160]  per gallon, all other vehicles banned from manufacture.
[49:14.160 --> 49:18.800]  And just as he cuts off our energy, Gazprom, the Russian main energy company, halts gas
[49:18.800 --> 49:26.600]  shipments to Europe via critical pipeline entry, he refuses to pay in rubles.
[49:26.600 --> 49:34.920]  That's just some of what we've got here in that stack, but let's get back to the globalist.
[49:34.920 --> 49:40.100]  Let's get back to what they're doing to us and the fact is, if we identify that we're
[49:40.100 --> 49:45.120]  not low on energy, that we're not low on resources, but we have parasites that want
[49:45.120 --> 49:51.600]  to dumb us down and make us poor to control us so they can depopulate us, well, then we
[49:51.600 --> 49:55.840]  are surging towards the future and cannot be defeated.
[49:55.840 --> 50:01.800]  So here's some of the articles that I suggest all of you go check out in some of the videos.
[50:01.800 --> 50:07.680]  What we have learned is the government has not been honest with us, Senator Rand Paul
[50:07.680 --> 50:15.880]  at Globalism Rising event at Regent University, and all these big leaders, governors, senators,
[50:15.880 --> 50:21.880]  you name it, are at a major university for days talking about the new world order, Klaus
[50:21.880 --> 50:28.040]  Schwab, Bill Gates, the eugenics operation, all of it, that is victory.
[50:28.040 --> 50:33.200]  Can we just identify who's running all this?
[50:33.200 --> 50:37.520]  And while we're meeting here in the U.S., they're meeting in Dubai.
[50:37.520 --> 50:44.720]  World Government Summit 2022 asked, are we ready for the new world order, says Klaus
[50:44.720 --> 50:46.920]  Schwab.
[50:46.920 --> 50:56.560]  X-W-H-O employee, that's U-N, warns of world government power grab, very important article
[50:56.560 --> 51:00.600]  and video by Brian Wilson at MFullWars.com.
[51:00.600 --> 51:05.840]  And we mentioned Dr. Malone, global fascism, Dr. Malone breaks down the World Economic
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.160]  Forum's globalist agenda.
[51:10.160 --> 51:16.160]  And in this clip, this was at the World Government Summit, see it right behind her?
[51:16.160 --> 51:21.440]  World Government Summit, top economists, we're about to abandon traditional systems of money
[51:21.440 --> 51:27.440]  and replace it with digital blockchain, but not run by the people, run by private central
[51:27.440 --> 51:31.520]  banks.
[51:31.520 --> 51:35.080]  What is the great reset and what do the globalists actually want?
[51:35.080 --> 51:42.000]  Very important article by Brandon Smith at alt-market.us, also posted at MFullWars.com.
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.240]  Big thick article, you can go read that.
[51:44.240 --> 51:48.080]  There's some mainstream news articles out of Forbes, bragging about it all.
[51:48.080 --> 51:56.640]  World Government Summit to host Forbes under 30 forum, CNBC, new world orders here, world
[51:56.640 --> 52:01.920]  governments here, again, all this doesn't exist, all this is crazy, all this is bad to talk
[52:01.920 --> 52:04.160]  about, but here it is.
[52:04.160 --> 52:16.120]  Here it is, global fascism, corporations running governments, dominating people, the definition
[52:16.120 --> 52:17.120]  of fascism.
[52:17.120 --> 52:19.760]  And then we move along to this.
[52:19.760 --> 52:26.440]  I mentioned this earlier, but what an incredible article, you've got to go read this.
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.200]  First they de-industrialize us, they ship our jobs overseas, they tell us we're a service
[52:30.200 --> 52:35.280]  economy, they shut the service economy down with a COVID-19 fair mongering, now they want
[52:35.280 --> 52:39.120]  to put us on universal basic income to put us deeper into debt, and they tell you, oh
[52:39.120 --> 52:46.520]  yeah, the dollar is dying, everybody's leaving it, so people during the war leave the dollar
[52:46.520 --> 52:53.400]  to the Chinese currency, to the Russian currency, but then the UN proposes, oh, those are too
[52:53.400 --> 52:58.880]  weak, we'll have a global digital currency, and that's what Davos is calling for right
[52:58.880 --> 53:05.000]  now, but you've got to lower the dollar down to be not inviting, not popular, so people
[53:05.000 --> 53:10.920]  jump from it, then get confused in other currencies, but don't worry, the new super currency,
[53:10.920 --> 53:16.040]  the digital one that's pre-programmable tokens that controls what you can buy, what you can
[53:16.040 --> 53:23.280]  do and surveils everything, that programmable token is now available, it's all been announced.
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.480]  Where are our senators, where's the Pentagon, where are our leaders, where is anybody saying
[53:28.480 --> 53:34.640]  this is a bad idea, because this is all going on at giant summits, all being announced,
[53:34.640 --> 53:40.360]  and then I talk about it, and the Democratic Party sues me and tries to shut our show down,
[53:40.360 --> 53:45.280]  because it's like the big adult tables over here at Thanksgiving, the little kids are
[53:45.280 --> 53:50.880]  over at this table, and I'm trying to get folks from the little kid table, the people,
[53:50.880 --> 53:55.200]  to go hey, we're adults too, what's going on, and come over to the big kid table, the
[53:55.200 --> 54:02.200]  big people table, and say hey, we want to be involved in this, we don't want to be obsolete,
[54:02.200 --> 54:06.400]  we don't want to be transgender, we don't want to be sterilized, we don't want to have
[54:06.400 --> 54:15.080]  nothing and own nothing and like it, so you really need to be discussing that, and talking
[54:15.080 --> 54:22.440]  about that and asking yourselves whether or not you like the future that these monsters
[54:22.440 --> 54:30.200]  right now are preparing for you and your family and me and everybody else, because we literally
[54:30.200 --> 54:35.520]  are all in this together, you know, I've been on Howard Stern's show a few times, and his
[54:35.520 --> 54:42.600]  show is a shadow of itself, and I don't say that because Howard Stern is so establishment
[54:42.600 --> 54:51.480]  and so anti-free speech and such a bootlicker, I say that because he's just mailing it in,
[54:51.480 --> 54:57.840]  there are almost no viewers, but it's still interesting and funny to watch it because
[54:57.840 --> 55:04.680]  what he says and does is like the mouth of the establishment or the rear end of it, and
[55:04.680 --> 55:16.800]  he came out with a piece making fun of me a few days ago, and he goes after us on a whole
[55:16.800 --> 55:24.760]  host of issues, but the real reason he goes after us in the piece, I'll reveal in the
[55:24.760 --> 55:35.240]  next hour when we play it, because it's extremely illustrative of how these people think and
[55:35.240 --> 55:41.400]  how their brains work, but the establishment is very, very scared, it's very, very scared
[55:41.400 --> 55:47.240]  of renaissance, it's very, very scared of new blood, it's very, very scared of change,
[55:47.240 --> 55:52.240]  and so it has inflicted the planet in its leftist brainwashing system that is nothing
[55:52.240 --> 56:01.000]  less than a disease because they themselves have succumbed to a form of disease, mentally
[56:01.000 --> 56:07.960]  and spiritually, and so that's why they do what they do, so that's coming up, but first,
[56:07.960 --> 56:14.880]  breaking recently unredacted documents prove Pfizer and FDA in a criminal conspiracy, new
[56:14.880 --> 56:24.000]  independent enhancement occurred in the vaccinated causing mass death, and that ties into so
[56:24.000 --> 56:31.600]  many of these other big subjects, we're going to be hitting next hour, and then this giant
[56:31.600 --> 56:41.880]  stack right here that says everything right here, boy, doesn't that photo tell you everything?
[56:41.880 --> 56:50.400]  Every student's marching in with a mask on, of course, until the LGBT cult about to be
[56:50.400 --> 56:56.760]  taught about their sexual future, their reproductive future, and to be mentally screwed up and
[56:56.760 --> 57:01.520]  told they should have sex with the same sex or be in bondage or anything so that they
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.720]  don't naturally follow their normal programmed biology.
[57:06.720 --> 57:14.400]  State sponsored, world government sponsored perverts taking full control of civilization,
[57:14.400 --> 57:19.200]  we're going to be covering what's really behind all this and more, and now they've gotten
[57:19.200 --> 57:26.080]  documents as of Friday, nobody's covering this, of the new Supreme Court Justice, she's
[57:26.080 --> 57:31.600]  about to be confirmed, they hope she's the Supreme Court Justice, the Supreme Court nominee
[57:31.600 --> 57:39.360]  or she apologized to child rapists. I'm not joking, men raping 13 year old girls, eight
[57:39.360 --> 57:44.600]  year old boys, and she said you shouldn't go to jail for that. We have the transcripts,
[57:44.600 --> 57:50.800]  we have it all coming up next hour, stay with us. I want to encourage listeners to understand
[57:50.800 --> 57:56.000]  that info wars is more important than it's ever been, and we can't stay on air without
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.120]  your support. So I knew we had over 100 t-shirts in the last few years that I basically designed,
[58:01.120 --> 58:06.000]  summer amazing, summer okay, the point is I designed them, over 200 designs, many of
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.640]  which only did one run of and I never talked about, there's one with 50 great t-shirts
[58:10.640 --> 58:17.160]  I've never worn, never had, never promoted on the show, that are at infowarstore.com.
[58:17.160 --> 58:21.200]  So the good news is if we even sell those at cost, that gets us a half million dollars
[58:21.200 --> 58:26.240]  in, we got about a $200, $300 underage every month to fund this independent operation with
[58:26.240 --> 58:29.840]  all the bandwidth we use for victims of our own success. So I'm going to try to create
[58:29.840 --> 58:36.520]  a page at infowarstore.com the next few days that has the 220 something shirts, which are
[58:36.520 --> 58:41.440]  all basically special edition. In fact I made the decision, even the old classics, shirts
[58:41.440 --> 58:47.720]  I designed 25, 26 years ago, like mass murderers agree gun control works, all of them are limited
[58:47.720 --> 58:53.000]  edition now, and it's the last run of all of these shirts, ball caps, everything. And
[58:53.000 --> 58:57.080]  the future, we're going to have limited editions for like a month or two of one or two shirts,
[58:57.080 --> 59:00.440]  and that's it, that's how you're supposed to do it to fund your operation and get the
[59:00.440 --> 59:06.240]  word out. So if you want these limited edition, and help keep us on air and get them at cost,
[59:06.240 --> 59:09.120]  almost all of them are set at cost, if they aren't, we're having them set at that, go
[59:09.120 --> 59:14.280]  to infowarstore.com and get some of these amazing t-shirts. A lot of them are designer, some
[59:14.280 --> 59:19.000]  of them are just plain james, they still have great messages, ball caps, three American
[59:19.000 --> 59:24.480]  shirts, wake up shirts, arrest Fauci shirts, Alex Jones' right shirts, they're all there
[59:24.480 --> 59:29.480]  at infowarstore.com, and then that's it, we're never going to make any of these again, all
[59:29.480 --> 59:33.400]  of them are limited edition, every one of these shirts, even though some of them were staples,
[59:33.400 --> 59:38.640]  we're never going to offer again. So please help us stay on air, get these original shirts
[59:38.640 --> 59:44.800]  that are now collector's editions at infowarstore.com, or by calling toll-free, triple-A-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[59:44.800 --> 59:50.720]  Go poke around the website, check them out, so for 200 of them right there.
[59:50.720 --> 59:56.480]  Getting a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[59:56.480 --> 1:00:09.600]  All right, next segment, we've got the Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, flamethrowing
[1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:14.800]  the pedos. It is powerful, we're going to hit, while they're sexualizing our children,
[1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:19.120]  how we stop them, then we'll hit the COVID poison, that garbage, and then big inside
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:24.920]  knowledge on the midterms of 219 days, Roger Stone, the last 30 minutes of tonight's show,
[1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:31.360]  then Christy Lee takes over with a huge Sunday Live broadcast, 6 to 8 p.m. Central Standard
[1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:38.640]  Time tonight, that's all coming up, but first I wanted to hit a really important John Boundary
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:45.760]  dealing with Disney peddling Marxist broke wokeness, because that sets it up for next
[1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:48.520]  segment, what we're about to hit, here it is.
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:53.840]  The left's Marxist revolution to normalize pedophilia has in recent years launched a
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:01:01.200]  full scale invasion from its decades old Frankfurt school origins, infiltrating American schools,
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:02.440]  culture, and government.
[1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:06.280]  I've received several emails confirming that these kinds of things are happening in schools.
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:11.920]  Hi Vicki, I have grandchildren in the Wanaquise school district, they have been instructed
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:16.680]  not to take pictures of, make fun of, stare at, or in any way call out the behavior of
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:19.480]  their classmates who are furries.
[1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:22.880]  The furries can choose whether they want to speak or not.
[1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:26.920]  The furries are allowed to dress in their choice of furry costumes.
[1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:31.160]  The furries can choose not to run in gym class, but instead sit at the feet of their teacher
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:33.120]  and lick their paws.
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:39.000]  Barking, kissing, and other similar animal noises are commonplace in the hallways at school.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.680]  The children have been told that the furries are an identity and they must treat these
[1:01:42.680 --> 1:01:46.920]  children normally and the school administration and teachers have normalized the behavior
[1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.200]  of the furries in their school.
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:50.480]  I am appalled.
[1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:55.480]  These progressives, democratic socialist community activists, as they like to be called, are
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:02:01.760]  merely wielding the imagined social injustice of dominant capitalist culture against itself.
[1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:04.120]  The right has declared war on Disney.
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:08.040]  Just since yesterday morning, Fox News mentioned the company more than 250 times.
[1:02:08.040 --> 1:02:13.200]  Their crusade is based on that new law signed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida,
[1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:18.480]  prohibiting instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in early elementary school
[1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:19.980]  classrooms.
[1:02:19.980 --> 1:02:24.200]  Under the guise of protecting children from being sexualized, the law essentially bans
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:26.760]  the discussion of gayness.
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:32.000]  That really sent everyone on the right side into the stratosphere.
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:36.400]  The most unhinge faction of the right, which as you heard on Fox News, is now vilifying
[1:02:36.400 --> 1:02:41.680]  Disney as some sort of creepy Q and non-adjacent nefarious group of sexual deviants.
[1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:45.600]  But all that obscures what I think is really going on here.
[1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:49.520]  We're seeing, and I really, really gather, seeing in the last month or so, a seismic
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:56.240]  change in our politics with the conservative movement restarting its war against gay people.
[1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:02.040]  No matter how many times the text of the bill is explained, the mass formation psychosis
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:07.760]  can't be broken, while the progenitors of pedophilia take their stand behind the lie.
[1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:10.680]  Don't say gay.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:19.120]  Don't say as the first two words in a sentence spoken by a political leader of a state.
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:24.600]  I'm here as a mother of two queer children, actually.
[1:03:24.600 --> 1:03:32.320]  One transgender child, and one pansexual child, and also as a leader.
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:41.120]  We have many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories, and yet we don't have enough
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:48.720]  leads, and narratives in which gay characters just get to be characters.
[1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:51.040]  What is goofy sexual preference?
[1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:55.920]  Is many a pansexual? Is Snow White secretly into BDSM?
[1:03:55.920 --> 1:03:58.000]  The answer is, of course, no.
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:03.760]  Their sexuality has never mattered to anyone, except for the creeps at Disney and the perverts
[1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.680]  coming for our children.
[1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:11.480]  Until recently, Disney had cornered the market on celebrating innocence, a brand built on
[1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:12.480]  trust.
[1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:15.640]  But this is the hill that that brand will die on.
[1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:18.840]  A lot of these issues are not necessarily political.
[1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:20.600]  It's about right and wrong.
[1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:26.760]  So I happen to feel, and I tweeted an opinion about the don't say gay bill in Florida.
[1:04:26.760 --> 1:04:27.760]  To me, it wasn't politics.
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:31.640]  It was what is right and what is wrong, and that just seemed wrong.
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:34.000]  It seemed potentially harmful to kids.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.720]  When you're dealing with right and wrong, or when you're dealing with something that
[1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.840]  does have a profound impact on your business, then I just think you'd have to do what is
[1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:46.240]  right and not worry about the potential backlash to it.
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:51.880]  There's no small development that the once happiest place on earth for boys and girls
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:57.120]  has become the wokest place on earth for the future indoctrination of Marxism.
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.960]  Or we can all just sit back and...
[1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:06.880]  There is very little contemporary study in the world of the planet's ruling class.
[1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:12.480]  Not in communist China, not in Mexico, not in the United States, not anywhere.
[1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:16.120]  Is there a real study of the planet's ruling class?
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:17.840]  It's done by design.
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:23.880]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:27.960]  that look into, say, the Anglo-American establishment, the founder of the Bilderberg
[1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:31.760]  group, the trilateral commission of the United Nations, the whole project of the Rothschilds
[1:05:31.760 --> 1:05:33.760]  and the Rockefellers.
[1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:38.160]  Until 10 years ago, the media said the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg group didn't
[1:05:38.160 --> 1:05:39.160]  exist.
[1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:42.160]  Well, now the Bilderberg group is public in its former head.
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:47.520]  So the steering committee is called Schwab, and he has set up the great reset in global
[1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:48.520]  government.
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:53.400]  And if, as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head-on about
[1:05:53.400 --> 1:05:57.400]  the second thing, or worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover, we don't have a shot.
[1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:21.400]  Can you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:34.200]  So the world is waiting about the fact there's a plan to manipulate the biological future
[1:06:34.200 --> 1:06:42.480]  of our children and connect that to the corporate Disney, New World Order, UN, combine.
[1:06:42.480 --> 1:06:45.560]  And now it's out in the open.
[1:06:45.560 --> 1:06:49.320]  They didn't want us to warn people about it while they were building it.
[1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:54.400]  But because we exposed it, because you exposed it, because so many people exposed it, they
[1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:58.120]  are now launching it full power out of desperation.
[1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:01.280]  Tabistock Institute, CIA, you name it.
[1:07:01.280 --> 1:07:03.200]  For TV viewers, you're going to have to look at this.
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:06.920]  For radio listeners, you're going to have to listen to it, but this is the facts of
[1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:07.920]  what's happening.
[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:16.680]  Here's a photo of a school with elementary students being marched in to the sexual brainwashing
[1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:19.480]  that is taking place inside the facility.
[1:07:19.480 --> 1:07:26.400]  It's not about love, it's not about tolerance, it's not about creating a sexual relationship,
[1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:31.360]  it's about creating a definitional moment with these children.
[1:07:31.360 --> 1:07:35.760]  Imagine if we saw like five, six kids marching in to their parents' house when they're a
[1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:38.400]  little, to talk about sex you go, that's a weird place.
[1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:44.520]  But when it's them, oh, with the rainbow flag hanging above in a ritual, so you know what
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.920]  you're going into, this is truly satanic.
[1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:53.880]  To protect our children, we really need to fire these teachers that are following this
[1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:54.880]  cult programming.
[1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:58.480]  This is a gang, this is a cult, that's what it is.
[1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:04.560]  And along with it, we see the signs up all over the country, stop having kids.org, stop
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:05.560]  having children.
[1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:11.120]  If you can't kill a kid before it's born, well, just make it sterilize itself, it's transgender,
[1:08:11.120 --> 1:08:12.520]  or be with the same sex.
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:13.880]  That's really the plan.
[1:08:13.880 --> 1:08:18.960]  This is the West one-child policy through social engineering.
[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:22.880]  Hollywood town, and how many times did I tell you this?
[1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:23.880]  Hundreds.
[1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:31.040]  Well, under the social credit score, if you're gay or don't have children, you get thousands
[1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:41.000]  of dollars a month from BlackRock, and now through the city of West Hollywood, and all
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:46.240]  their subliminal images that are on screen right now, we'll get to that in a moment.
[1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:52.600]  You get thousands of dollars a month free if you go sign up and identify what type of
[1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:53.600]  sex you have.
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:56.440]  I mean, the government now knows what type of sex you have.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:01.080]  This is so fascistic, this is so evil, this is so sick, but they know Americans want to
[1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:06.520]  be open and free, so they push their whole revolution of coming after our children to
[1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:11.720]  screw them up and label them and lead their lives out of this.
[1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:18.560]  West Hollywood to give people basic income for free if they don't have children, if they're
[1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:19.960]  gay.
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:24.880]  Clown World, UK hospitals are now being encouraged to ask all men under 60 if they're pregnant
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:31.880]  before getting medical procedures, and the good news is the Disney stock is going straight
[1:09:31.880 --> 1:09:36.760]  down, ladies and gentlemen, as the world realizes that it's in their portfolio.
[1:09:36.760 --> 1:09:42.400]  MTG was getting criticized, oh, we found a few thousand dollars of Disney stock in her
[1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:46.680]  portfolio.
[1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:50.120]  She said, well, great, I'm taking it out of there, I know it was there.
[1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:55.000]  Let us know, let us think about what's in the portfolio, let us get it out of there.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:10:04.920]  We don't want to be part of Walt Pito Co, Pito Co, no longer Walt Disney Co, it's now Walt
[1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:06.920]  Rapier Children Company.
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:09.840]  How many of their executives have been arrested raping children?
[1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:12.960]  How many of their workers held hundreds in the last month?
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:20.520]  And look at this, this is a real Disney image, they're famous for the subliminals, where Mickey
[1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:28.520]  and Minnie are having a dance, and Minnie's lower body is, of course, something else,
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:31.080]  100% a penis.
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:35.960]  That's real certified Disney, ladies and gentlemen, assaulting your children.
[1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:42.280]  There's another transgender man who gave birth to his son, criticized his medical staff for
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:47.200]  calling him mother, and claims it's important to stop automatically linking pregnancy with
[1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:48.200]  being a woman.
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:55.440]  There's a crazy woman with a beard that has a baby, and then it's a woman, I mean, it's
[1:10:55.440 --> 1:11:01.040]  all them training you, oh, look at this mother, just had a baby, they had a surrogate have
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:06.680]  a baby, but they say, oh, this man just gave birth, and the subtitle as well, actually
[1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:07.680]  a woman did.
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:13.120]  So you've got the genders over here, you've got female and male, and then you've got all
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:19.880]  the mental illnesses over here that this alien force is bringing down upon us.
[1:11:19.880 --> 1:11:26.160]  We'll get to the autism in children in more in a moment, but first, let's play a woman
[1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:33.200]  who's gone viral on Instagram and Twitter for letting her husband's father know, oh,
[1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:37.120]  this baby boy, she holds up like a trophy, he's gonna be gay.
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:43.040]  He ain't gonna like girls, he'll probably have his testicles cut off by the time he
[1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:44.040]  stands.
[1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:50.040]  She just holds him up, look, I'm with the establishment, he's gay, he's gay, he's gay,
[1:11:50.040 --> 1:11:52.040]  here it is.
[1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:54.040]  Baby is gay.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:11:57.000]  Yeah, this is him, he's gay.
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:05.600]  I called up my dad, and then started over, back it up, I gay, I gay.
[1:12:05.600 --> 1:12:10.640]  And notice she's getting all thrilled, like it's excites her that she's sexualizing a
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:13.800]  child that is even two years old.
[1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:17.680]  But she sat there like it's a parrot and told it, you're gay, it doesn't even know what
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:21.880]  that means, but it knows it's mommy told it, that's what it's gonna do.
[1:12:21.880 --> 1:12:25.720]  It's like I saw this lady we aired on Friday, she goes, I've got two-year-olds and three-year-olds
[1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:28.040]  I take care of, they all want to be gay.
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:36.280]  No, their teacher's like, you are gay, then we are gay, I mean, literally, if a mother,
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:40.320]  well I guess we have a mother right here, is telling their child this, they're sexualizing
[1:12:40.320 --> 1:12:41.720]  on their mentally ill.
[1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:47.600]  But oh, when it's the school, it's like, oh, it's so cute, I mean, these people are just
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:52.360]  demonic, start over, it's hard to watch here it is.
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:12:57.080]  Baby is gay, yeah, this is him, he's gay.
[1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:03.920]  I called up my dad, and I said, hey, guess what, your grandson, gay, gay, gay, gay.
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:09.160]  My dad says, you can't just say that your baby is gay before he gets a chance to tell
[1:13:09.160 --> 1:13:14.120]  us he's gay, and I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:22.080]  Straight people do it all the time, little baby boy is born, oh, he's gonna be a heartbreaker.
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:29.040]  Little baby girl is born, oh, you better lock her up when she turns 16, clearly people want
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:31.040]  their children to be straight.
[1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:35.000]  Well, my son is gay, gay, very gay.
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:42.200]  Yeah, they, like whales are straight, and horses are, and butterflies, it's called biology.
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:46.200]  These people are in a cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:51.000]  But talk about clown world, here is the transgender, the creepiest looking dude ever, undersecretary
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.240]  of health, declared a role model for trans kids.
[1:13:55.240 --> 1:14:02.160]  This is Rachel Levine, a dude with a penis, now in what looks like an admiral outfit,
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:07.360]  he got at a costume shop, talking about how he's an admiral.
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:10.960]  So he's not just a woman, he's an admiral now.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:16.520]  How about a genie, how about a Empire State building, I mean, you're everything.
[1:14:16.520 --> 1:14:20.920]  This is mass mental illness, they're teaching the public, here it is.
[1:14:20.920 --> 1:14:25.880]  How much do you see yourself, in some ways admiral Levine is a role model for trans kids,
[1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:28.360]  given that you are such a high ranking official in the government?
[1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:33.200]  Well, thank you so much, it is such an honor to serve in this position, it's an honor to
[1:14:33.200 --> 1:14:38.000]  have been nominated and then confirmed as the assistant secretary for health, and then
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:42.520]  truly an honor to have taken the uniform of the United States Public Health Service Commission
[1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.280]  Corps as a four star admiral.
[1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:52.640]  So I am truly privileged, and I am honored to serve as a role model for transgender individuals,
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:55.440]  but what I want to do is give back.
[1:14:55.440 --> 1:15:00.520]  And what the two ways that I can give back is one, to be very vocal and advocate for
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:07.520]  the LGBTQI plus community, specifically transgender individuals, and to work on specific policies
[1:15:07.520 --> 1:15:15.600]  at HHS and throughout the administration that support diversity, equity and inclusion.
[1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:22.320]  So it wants a relationship with your children, it rubs the lotion on the skin, a creepy scary
[1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:23.320]  looking dude.
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:27.200]  I mean, again, if you want to make a horror movie of somebody that kidnaps kids, keeps
[1:15:27.200 --> 1:15:31.680]  them in basements, you are casting admiral.
[1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:40.840]  And you heard admiral, I am a four star admiral, commanding marine sailors in the field, it's
[1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:46.000]  an admiral, it's all about delusion, all about making you give up on being hardworking, give
[1:15:46.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  up on being a good person and saying the whole world's insane, I give up, and then these people
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  take over.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  You can't let them do it.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:58.520]  It's a freak show, it's a behavioral psychology, we're going to beat them, God's on our side.
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:04.480]  The globalists are bombarding us with propaganda and with spiritual warfare and with poisons
[1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:07.400]  and chemicals added to the food, it's all come out.
[1:16:07.400 --> 1:16:11.560]  And they're doing that not because we're weak but because we're made the image of God,
[1:16:11.560 --> 1:16:17.240]  the creator, and we are powerful and the social engineers fear that so much.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:21.640]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up
[1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:25.440]  with the boy, is it true?
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:31.280]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:35.080]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural
[1:16:35.080 --> 1:16:41.760]  death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the God
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:43.560]  of this world who is a loser.
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:47.200]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep them full wars in the air now more than
[1:16:47.200 --> 1:16:48.200]  ever.
[1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:51.880]  And even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:56.640]  up is safe handling and we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:58.140]  they just announced.
[1:16:58.140 --> 1:17:02.480]  I'm very excited to welcome David Sinclair, he's a former telecommunications and tech
[1:17:02.480 --> 1:17:06.120]  industry executive and is now the founder and CEO of Volta Wireless.
[1:17:06.120 --> 1:17:11.120]  You can now pre-order a Volta Private Phone or the Volta Private Phone Pro with promo
[1:17:11.120 --> 1:17:16.400]  code Alex at checkout and in fact we have here a Volta Wireless Phone, this is still
[1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:21.600]  in pre-production, you can pre-order it right now, but it's a beautiful phone, it looks
[1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:28.080]  like any Android or Samsung phone but it's manufactured by Volta Wireless so it doesn't
[1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:35.560]  have those embedded hardware tracking services that Google and Apple rely on, it's really
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:39.280]  a beautiful phone, very lightweight, I'm very excited about this, so people can pre-order
[1:17:39.280 --> 1:17:40.280]  this now, is that right?
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:43.000]  That's right, people can pre-order it now and it's scheduled to start shipping in May
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.440]  and so the Volta Private Phone and the Volta Private Phone Pro really give a lot of security
[1:17:48.440 --> 1:17:52.680]  that people are not used to having in terms of their privacy with Google and with Apple.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:58.120]  If you look at the Volta Private Phone or base offering, it's a secure piece of hardware
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:01.280]  that's manufactured in a secure facility to prevent any type of what they call zero day
[1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:05.200]  hacks, so nobody can stick some chip in there or anything else in the hardware that's going
[1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:08.040]  to be able to send information that we don't know about, right?
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:11.480]  The second piece of the secure operating system, it's a de-Google version of Android meaning
[1:18:11.480 --> 1:18:15.120]  that you don't have any of the Google services, you have the same abilities, there's a maps
[1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:19.040]  offering and things like that but you don't have data going back to Google anymore.
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:23.760]  Now the Volta Private Phone Pro brings a few additional benefits, one of the core ones
[1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:27.080]  is with the Volta Private Phone Pro you're going to get an app that essentially is a
[1:18:27.080 --> 1:18:30.840]  phone controller app and with this app what you're able to do is to actually turn off
[1:18:30.840 --> 1:18:34.880]  certain pieces of your hardware so that they aren't sending out signals of any kind and
[1:18:34.880 --> 1:18:39.720]  so that really gives you the ability to really control what information your phone is sharing
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:40.720]  with anyone.
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:44.560]  I believe that privacy is the key to freedom and if you don't have freedom you can never
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:45.560]  have prosperity.
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:49.260]  So really if these things are concerns to you, if you're tired of having your mobile
[1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:53.600]  phone used as a tracking device, go out to VoltaWireless.com, sign up with the coupon
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:57.600]  code ALEX, you get your first month for $9.99, give it a shot, try it out.
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  I want to thank folks that got part one in the three part Founder Series at 1776coin.com
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:11.160]  and the second installment is the Tree of Liberty, Thomas Jefferson quote, must be
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:15.400]  watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants, it's a coin I designed, I'm very, very proud
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:20.800]  of it and it will end up being a collectible, I know that the first coin is already selling
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:24.840]  on eBay and other places for three times what we sold it.
[1:19:24.840 --> 1:19:30.520]  We need to sell all 10,000 of these very, very quickly and I appreciate listeners getting
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:34.600]  over half of them now, I'd like to move them out very quickly, I think they will sell out
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:41.000]  probably in five or six more days and without the last coin sale we would not be operating
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.960]  at the same capacity, we would have had to lay off a lot of people and had some big problems
[1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:48.240]  so as a limited edition, collectible, tied to our political movement of liberty and freedom
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.240]  and it's needed for our infrastructure and building new systems so please give yourself
[1:19:52.240 --> 1:20:00.040]  and us aid in the fight against the new order at 1776coin.com.
[1:20:00.040 --> 1:20:11.480]  Starting a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:11.480 --> 1:20:25.320]  Day after day, alone on a hill, the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[1:20:25.320 --> 1:20:33.760]  Nobody wants to hear him, nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
[1:20:33.760 --> 1:20:43.600]  and he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and the
[1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:51.640]  eyes in his head, sees the world spinning round, so I'm going to lay some heavy knowledge
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:56.760]  on you, you're all going to know it internally once you heard it, you tune in here not because
[1:20:56.760 --> 1:21:02.800]  you want to hear what you want to hear but because you already know what's true.
[1:21:02.800 --> 1:21:09.680]  You know why they dress up women like at the clown and men like at the clown and dress
[1:21:09.680 --> 1:21:18.720]  up women like men and men like women and try to target children because children epigenetically
[1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:24.160]  in their instincts know what's good and knows what's bad and they've never seen something
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:29.240]  in their entire genetic history that this life, this body is only one manifestation
[1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:40.840]  of, they've never seen anything like that and that's why they have a man that says he's
[1:21:40.840 --> 1:21:50.000]  a woman who says he's an admiral, dressed up on TV saying I want a relationship with
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:58.880]  your children because in all your children's genetic history they've never run into a man
[1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:02.880]  saying they're a woman in a clown outfit saying they're an admiral.
[1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:08.960]  That's why drag queen story time, it's weird ass crazy outfits and purple hair and clown
[1:22:08.960 --> 1:22:14.120]  makeup and they'll say in the parking lot I'm here to groom the children, I need them
[1:22:14.120 --> 1:22:19.920]  because it's a cult and they took over the Boy Scouts and they took over Penn State
[1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:24.360]  and they took over the Catholic Church and they took over everything so you go why are
[1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:29.840]  they so brazen, why are they like you send your you know a nine year old daughter to
[1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:35.200]  a summer camp and then there's men saying they're women full grown men sleeping in the
[1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:42.560]  room with them, it's about power, it's about control of men's spaces and women's spaces
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:50.600]  and children's spaces and it's their entire agenda and I got more of these clips but
[1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:56.440]  I just played you a clip earlier of a mother saying oh this baby's grandfather says you
[1:22:56.440 --> 1:23:02.640]  can't tell a one year old it's gay, I am, you understand folks they're telling a child
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:08.320]  its identity is that it's going to have sex with the same sex, you wouldn't tell a one
[1:23:08.320 --> 1:23:12.480]  year old you're going to have sex with women and look at the demonic look on her face,
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:17.480]  she thinks she's cool, she thinks she's part of the club, she thinks she's open, she thinks
[1:23:17.480 --> 1:23:23.120]  it's great but what it does is bring in the transhumanism.
[1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:29.960]  The child is nothing but a captured sacrifice for her to show it off like she's captured
[1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:35.680]  a flag or the standard, oh really all you wanted was gay marriage, well it didn't turn
[1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:42.000]  out that huh, all you wanted was our children, this isn't about gay or any of that, it's
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:47.680]  about not having children if you do have children sterilizing them and screwing them up and
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:54.480]  using them as some trendy virtue signal you destroy.
[1:23:54.480 --> 1:24:02.880]  So here's clip 14, this is a transgender army soldier being celebrated as a hero and
[1:24:02.880 --> 1:24:11.240]  then let's go to the next clip, clip 20 is shocky saying pregnant people not women and
[1:24:11.240 --> 1:24:18.120]  then 23 is the real agenda behind transhumanism, I'm going to air all these, I don't have time
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:25.600]  for the full clip, go ahead and play those first two clips.
[1:24:25.600 --> 1:24:31.600]  You are an inspiration to many, you are breaking barriers and it's important though for us
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:37.280]  I think for everyone to understand what motivates you, what inspires you, what keeps you motivated.
[1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:42.000]  What really keeps me motivated is the people that are going to come after us, some people
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.040]  have called me a trailblazer in some of the things that I do and that's something I really
[1:24:46.040 --> 1:24:51.160]  embrace because what that means is that it's not about me, it's about the fact that the
[1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:57.640]  road behind me is now paved and the generation coming after us has an easier chance to make
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:01.640]  it to where I've made it, to make it where so many others have made it but then they've
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:04.320]  got the time and the energy to go further.
[1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:08.480]  So if we can set the conditions where the folks after us get to do even greater things
[1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:09.480]  I'm thrilled.
[1:25:09.480 --> 1:25:17.080]  Beginning today as many as 720,000 pregnant and postpartum people across the United States
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:21.480]  could be guaranteed Medicaid and children's health insurance program coverage.
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:27.560]  Beginning today as many as 720,000 pregnant and postpartum people across the United States
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:32.240]  could be guaranteed Medicaid and children's health insurance program coverage.
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.120]  Now if you go back to that last dude, I can tell you looking at it, he's a PSYOP officer,
[1:25:37.120 --> 1:25:44.120]  globalist running serious ops because they know they're depopulating us and they know
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:48.640]  they put chemicals in the water that are sterilizing almost everybody and also emasculating people
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:54.720]  so they're going to tell men, hey, just because you got emasculated, don't get gene therapies,
[1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:58.760]  don't take hormones, you're really a woman.
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:03.040]  That's just a PSYOP, that guy's an officer in PSYOPs, you know, the space force, this
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:08.720]  is 100% clear, this is meant again to demoralize the human force, bring in the robots because
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:16.000]  they won't play all these games, I mean attacking our biology, men and women is the very core
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.440]  of taking us down.
[1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:22.960]  Let me show you some more of these, again you have Clown World Transgender Undersecretary
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:29.520]  of Health declares a role model for trans kids, the main mission is get to your children.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:35.920]  That is a pervert missile, a grooming missile, coming right at them, I'm sick of all the
[1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:42.640]  jokes, I've worked my balls off to become a woman of the year, look at this headline,
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:49.120]  not a joke, mother and son are becoming father and daughter, the mom is becoming a man, the
[1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:58.680]  girl's becoming, the mother's becoming, mother and son are becoming father and mother, the
[1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:04.600]  daughter's becoming the father, the son's becoming the daughter, because they're doing
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:15.440]  what's trendy, what's cool and who taught the daughter how to do it, oh look, Tony Blair
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.360]  with the guy that runs sex dungeons and murdered children, and Sittinette Ritzel's on record,
[1:27:20.360 --> 1:27:26.160]  Jimmy Savelle, what a nice group of people that came up with all of this.
[1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:31.960]  50,000 sign petitions for Disney to rehire James Gunn for Guardians of the Galaxy Part
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:41.160]  3, every three pedophile parties, here's the Disney pedo stack, I already showed you
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:46.120]  some liminal images earlier but for adults you can go look this up for yourself, this
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:51.200]  is what Disney has been up to for a long, long time, the truth about the hidden sexual
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:58.720]  messages in Disney's movies, that's mainstream Australian news, news.com.au and the reason
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:02.480]  they do it is that's stealing the future of someone, if you can do that you got a lot
[1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:08.000]  of power, Weinstein's scandal exposes Disney for giving convicted pedophile access to kids
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:16.480]  as film director who'd rape little boys, that's who they are, four Disney employees, retired
[1:28:16.480 --> 1:28:21.800]  judge among 108 arrested and human trafficking sting in central Florida, including filming
[1:28:21.800 --> 1:28:30.480]  footage of young children being raped, Disney hire convicted child molester, Disney's employees
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:38.240]  among, again it just goes on and on and on and on and on, hand of silence, God bless
[1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:43.440]  her, calls for boycott of pedophile Disney, yeah, we're in a war against a pervert cult
[1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:47.960]  that took over the Catholic church, everything else, we're gonna let them take us over, the
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:53.400]  answer is no, our children are too much with your poison shots and all of your crap, we
[1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:59.040]  know who you are and we say no to you, Roger Stone's about to take over, stay with us.

[1:33:00.760 --> 1:33:16.400]  on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones and it's time for humanity to stand
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:20.880]  up in the info war and say I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this but you
[1:33:20.880 --> 1:33:29.600]  want to fight you better believe you got one from the front lines of the information war
[1:33:29.600 --> 1:33:31.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:17.120]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us again on this live sunday edition I really
[1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:23.600]  appreciate roger stone former top advisor to president trump joining us to get into
[1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:30.200]  so many issues you know he was on about mass and cothorn and the republican party denying
[1:34:30.200 --> 1:34:35.840]  that there are bipartisan sex parties and things go on that are all about control and
[1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:42.400]  then now we've got all the january 6 information we've got the laptop coming out we're now
[1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:47.640]  even CNN has turned against hunter biden and it's saying he's a chinese spy that to me
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:51.760]  signals are getting ready to try to remove biden how would that unfold how would that
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:55.880]  work out roger thanks for joining us tonight those are the three big topics i've got for
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:00.360]  you what else is front and center for you and what do you want to hit first well let's
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:05.520]  take them right off let's take it right off the top i mean yes i did come forward because
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:12.400]  i was myself a washington elite i had a very successful lobbying and political consulting
[1:35:12.400 --> 1:35:20.200]  firm i was a month for 41 years among the elites i can tell you first hand that these
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:26.120]  parties and this kind of rampant drug use exists in the upper echelon in the elites
[1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:34.840]  of washington dc of both parties and and because i am am redeemed in christ i can look back
[1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:40.480]  at my sins and admit to them and therefore i yes i should have credit credibility on
[1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:48.520]  this issue now of course some online say certified cocaine and orgy expert roger stone backs
[1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:56.640]  up madison coffins claims no felix i i'm able to tell the truth i have truth to power in
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:02.520]  this case because i accepted christ in my life and i'm a different person than the person
[1:36:02.520 --> 1:36:10.320]  who partied hard in washington dc and and what's amazing to me alex is the speed in
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:16.640]  which the members have moved to silence him lest he blurt out a name now those who say
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:22.120]  he should name names no i actually think he's being discreet but i think he could name names
[1:36:22.120 --> 1:36:28.960]  i think some of the names would be rather shocking so i don't know why the senior republicans
[1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:35.920]  didn't just kind of let this ride not comment on it let the phenomena burn out but the vehemence
[1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:45.920]  with which uh... kevin mccarthy uh... not only attacked uh... carthorne and i think mischaracterized
[1:36:45.920 --> 1:36:51.080]  a private meeting with him which uh... uh... mccarthy said that the young congressman
[1:36:51.080 --> 1:36:56.800]  from north carline had retracted or admitted making up his charges that is not what carthorne
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:02.200]  told me that is mccarthy trying to put words in carthorne's mouth carthorne has not backed
[1:37:02.200 --> 1:37:07.520]  down and he should not because he's telling the truth alex well that's right roger and
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:12.880]  let's be a hundred percent clear you and i were both very very specific we said here's
[1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:18.160]  some news articles it's well-known people know that these orgies happen they're bipartisan
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:23.720]  then they go why is stone and jones saying republicans are in orgies with cocaine and
[1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:28.040]  why are they on cocaine with them they totally twisted what we were saying we were just backing
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:34.120]  him up saying you don't think elites in california new york and dc party i mean all carthorne
[1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:38.080]  said is it's just like house of cards i've been invited to that well of course that's
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:44.520]  going on you've been at those things he was invited it's preposterous to say that that
[1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:50.440]  this isn't happening let's remember that the american people have paid out millions and
[1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:56.320]  millions and millions of dollars in settlements secret settlements uh... against members of
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:38:01.520]  congress in nancy polosi and her comrades pay the legal bills but we're not even allowed
[1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:06.160]  to have a list of those who have broken the rules so that's the kind of people you have
[1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:11.720]  in in in congress a substantial number of them have had to settle sexual harassment or other
[1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:17.760]  sex related and roger let's not forget it's not just sexual harassment rape we have interns
[1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:23.400]  getting their brains beat out in florida no there's no there's no question there's murder
[1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:29.400]  in there so uh... it is uh... i think the whole thing
[1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:36.360]  uh... is uh... is a joke but i noticed that the two senators from north carolina now trying
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:42.920]  to bump off carthorne in the coming republican primary uh... very late entry for that in
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:47.320]  my opinion but appears that they're they're going to try it and again he obviously didn't
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:51.760]  do it for political power he's done some podcast he talks about yeah this is going on so they
[1:38:51.760 --> 1:38:56.880]  keep asking why did he do it he's just talking like a normal person or what's our angle saying
[1:38:56.880 --> 1:39:01.360]  he's telling the truth we're just we're just commentating there's not some big political
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:06.360]  mastermind thing going on they're like why is roger stone backing him up what's really
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:11.040]  going on because everybody knows they got sex parties in dc folks
[1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:15.000]  yeah well i mean look i i uh... knew what i was getting into when i started talking
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.120]  about this but i still think he's right let's move on to your next question i agree let's
[1:39:19.120 --> 1:39:23.520]  move on well i mean i throw out a lot what do you make of the laptop seems like the wheels
[1:39:23.520 --> 1:39:28.720]  have completely come off mainstream news all turning on biden and uh... his idiot crack
[1:39:28.720 --> 1:39:34.600]  head son the chinese spy all a while they cover it up in the campaign they censor everybody
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:38.000]  and now the floodgates are open what does that signify
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:43.360]  it signifies it signifies that the powers that are really running the country have finally
[1:39:43.360 --> 1:39:47.640]  determined that uh... good old joe from scranton is dead weight
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:50.120]  the sun situations only to get bad
[1:39:50.120 --> 1:39:53.680]  the old man barely can get jibberish out of his mouth
[1:39:53.680 --> 1:39:55.960]  he can't stay on a script
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:40:00.480]  uh... he shoots from the hip and calls it causes international incidents
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:03.560]  he craps his pants when he goes to the vatican
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:04.720]  literally
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:08.560]  uh... so they had a certain point the baggage becomes too heavy
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:11.280]  alex if you look at the what i had the stone plan
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:15.280]  it entails the democrats themselves removing by
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:20.080]  so the the the the the people run the country
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:22.280]  uh... the ruling elites
[1:40:22.280 --> 1:40:27.200]  have decided biden is now dispensable he always serve them anyway so hot or is the
[1:40:27.200 --> 1:40:30.000]  pretext to not get into all things joe's done
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  because you know in the white house said they may have been pardoned hunter looks
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:34.520]  like joe may fight
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:38.400]  so so how would that look them trying to remove their puppet if he fights
[1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:40.440]  on the way out
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:44.080]  well he's very very stubborn that's part of the problem
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:47.680]  uh... it he also thinks he knows everything when he knows
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:49.480]  nothing but he's also
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:53.080]  barely compass meant to so i don't know what kind of condition
[1:40:53.080 --> 1:40:56.800]  he's in the fight his wife will not want to go in for a long battle
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:01.400]  uh... and since lord emperor brock who say will be a obama
[1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:05.920]  and bill gates and zuckerberg and soros got together and said
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:10.000]  as guys now dispensable we is too heavy a burden let's get another leftist in
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:10.840]  office
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:12.760]  who will do our bidding
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:16.600]  i totally agree so how how are they going to pull this office to be
[1:41:16.600 --> 1:41:18.920]  very nasty
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:23.360]  well here's you don't know and that is whether he goes along with the fights
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:24.240]  i mean
[1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:27.760]  what they'll try to say is good old joe biden what a great guy
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:31.240]  it's a shame that his health failed me just couldn't finish the job
[1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:34.560]  but he said it's on the right course the bill back better program
[1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:36.680]  and now president kamala harris
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:40.680]  will carry out the rest of it now if you've republicans have won the senate
[1:41:40.680 --> 1:41:43.920]  and she nominate somebody for vice president i would suggest the republicans
[1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:44.920]  simply
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:46.160]  refuse
[1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.200]  to uh... to confirm that nominee
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:53.640]  until uh... and an impeachment of an immediate impeachment
[1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:54.400]  effort
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:56.600]  which we have to begin in the house
[1:41:56.600 --> 1:42:00.440]  which is like an indictment the house passes an article of impeachment
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:02.600]  which the house republicans would do
[1:42:02.600 --> 1:42:06.480]  uh... and uh... then the senate would have to hold a trial
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:10.320]  uh... so the real question is can you get to the house now
[1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:13.240]  can you get to sixty seven votes in the trial
[1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:19.080]  child could be pretty ugly these people guilty of crimes against humanity
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:22.280]  well said what i've got a lot of questions final segment you roger but
[1:42:22.280 --> 1:42:23.640]  while
[1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:25.440]  what do you make of
[1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:29.320]  the january six hysteria and how they're running their whole campaign on that
[1:42:29.320 --> 1:42:32.160]  with no evidence and then also want to ask you
[1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:36.080]  about the midterms just in general and what you expect to happen because
[1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.200]  if the democrats don't pull a rabbit out of the hat they're done
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:42.160]  roger stones our guests don't call truth
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:44.960]  and roger what is the best websites we go to break that's so many great

[1:46:20.400 --> 1:46:21.120]  summit
[1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:23.560]  and they are announcing incredible tyranny
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:26.440]  everything we've talked about is now coming true
[1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:28.880]  and the globalists want to take us off air
[1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:29.960]  ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.480]  we are running the biggest sale in the history of info wars right now
[1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:35.760]  in our twenty eight years
[1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:40.840]  all info wars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:45.400]  we're never gonna print these t-shirts and ball caps info wars flags again
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:48.640]  you may have t-shirts and apparel in the future but i don't even know
[1:46:48.640 --> 1:46:52.000]  we are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now i'm

[1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:03.720]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:10.720]  it's alex jones
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:19.240]  we're caught in a trap
[1:47:19.240 --> 1:47:23.400]  i can't walk out
[1:47:23.400 --> 1:47:27.240]  because i love you too much
[1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:30.680]  welcome back you know i've talked to some former high-level people in the
[1:47:30.680 --> 1:47:33.240]  trump administration today
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:37.080]  and they agree that the democrats are a hundred percent running on january six
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:39.840]  and the republicans are laughing at him because we weren't part of a conspiracy
[1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:40.960]  nothing went on
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:44.680]  but they're really intending something in two hundred nineteen days
[1:47:44.680 --> 1:47:47.760]  to try to just outlaw the republican party and outlaw
[1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:49.560]  questioning election fraud
[1:47:49.560 --> 1:47:54.000]  roger stone is obviously been implicated in demonize just as i have
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.760]  this is really important on other listeners are sick and hearing about it i
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:47:58.560]  am too
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:01.200]  it's it's very real it's very front and center
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:04.800]  what do you make of this week's big developments roger
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:09.360]  uh... well i look the democrats have nothing else to run it so first of all
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:11.680]  january six is a distraction
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:15.360]  also happens to be the only card they have left to play
[1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:18.760]  gas prices are out all off the charts
[1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:24.240]  uh... inflation is uh... ravaging families we have really substantial
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:26.440]  food sort of shortages i want to buy
[1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:28.480]  chicken breasts tonight
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:31.240]  uh... to chop up to make a chicken cacciatore would
[1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:34.480]  send marzano tomatoes little garlic and so on
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:38.920]  uh... there are no chicken breasts i swear to you in the most prosperous
[1:48:38.920 --> 1:48:41.440]  a country in the face of the earth so
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:45.000]  the democrats what they seek to do though is take
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.760]  everything surrounding january fifth and sixth
[1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:49.240]  and make all
[1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:54.120]  constitutionally protected political activity such as pre-association
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:55.360]  free expression
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:48:59.560]  free speech regarding the results uh... you have the constitutional right to
[1:48:59.560 --> 1:49:02.000]  question the authority of an election
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:02.920]  uh...
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:05.680]  uh... the fb i reported as you know back
[1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:08.760]  uh... to roiders months ago that
[1:49:08.760 --> 1:49:13.880]  no evidence that either you or i was involved in any conspiracy
[1:49:13.880 --> 1:49:17.320]  uh... there is another group of in charge with conspiracy
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:20.080]  they are innocent till proven guilty
[1:49:20.080 --> 1:49:23.320]  uh... we've seen the government's case against them yet
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:26.600]  uh... but those who broke the law should be prosecuted
[1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:30.200]  on the other hand we'd be the people who are charged
[1:49:30.200 --> 1:49:32.080]  deserve due process
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:34.920]  they deserve adequate representation
[1:49:34.920 --> 1:49:40.080]  they deserve sanitary into uh... uh... incarceration
[1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:44.080]  i mean these people are living in a feces and blood-infested
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:47.920]  hellhole in the dc jail in it and many cases
[1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:50.880]  uh... their attorneys do not have discovered from the government the
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:52.880]  government's holding back discovery
[1:49:52.880 --> 1:49:54.560]  including potentially
[1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.080]  uh... uh... sculptory uh... uh... material and make no mistake this is a
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:02.320]  beta test for all of us what they're doing
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:06.360]  well i know we've already had the tragic assassination of part me the
[1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:07.320]  tragic
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:10.360]  suicide of one of the men in there
[1:50:10.360 --> 1:50:13.120]  uh... i was contacted recently by
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:16.840]  jeff brown if you know him he's spoken here on info wars
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:18.440]  they confiscated the
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:20.880]  the uh... the uh...
[1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:23.920]  what i guess i should say the contraband cell phone
[1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:27.680]  he was talking info wars on a and he want to get reconnected with you alec
[1:50:27.680 --> 1:50:28.400]  so
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:31.480]  look we have we actually have a guy inside the gulag
[1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:34.080]  who can speak and the things he tells you
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.720]  are just horrific uh... in terms of the twenty three hours in solitary
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:40.040]  confinement
[1:50:40.040 --> 1:50:43.800]  men or women who are not men who are not bob
[1:50:43.800 --> 1:50:46.680]  vaccinated are not permitted to uh...
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:47.720]  to shave
[1:50:47.720 --> 1:50:51.640]  uh... or to brush their teeth and they're rarely allowed to shower
[1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:55.840]  uh... in this is this is a violation the geneva conventions
[1:50:55.840 --> 1:50:57.080]  we treat
[1:50:57.080 --> 1:50:58.120]  terrorists
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:01.360]  better than we are treating these americans
[1:51:01.360 --> 1:51:05.480]  oh yeah they've got documentaries get those like a summer camp compared to this
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:08.600]  uh... and the head of the dc jails is like this crazy
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:10.520]  left this woman
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:13.160]  yeah it's really quite extraordinary uh...
[1:51:13.160 --> 1:51:16.320]  ultimately of course all of it will be known to the american people know that
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:20.280]  they will be outraged but roger's will be exactly that's my big thirty five
[1:51:20.280 --> 1:51:21.880]  thousand foot view for you
[1:51:21.880 --> 1:51:24.880]  your great well-known political and also the really good
[1:51:24.880 --> 1:51:26.240]  crystal ball
[1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:29.200]  what's happening the democrats that's the a full
[1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:32.440]  political realignment against them
[1:51:32.440 --> 1:51:35.600]  uh... everything they touched is collapsing so they know that
[1:51:35.600 --> 1:51:37.560]  so they're trying to start a civil war
[1:51:37.560 --> 1:51:40.520]  or do something to stop us before we vote them out
[1:51:40.520 --> 1:51:42.280]  what do you expect to happen
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:47.080]  i i think it's entirely possible and i'm stressed that i say possible
[1:51:47.080 --> 1:51:51.360]  uh... for the local heads of media matters for at america i said possible
[1:51:51.360 --> 1:51:54.560]  that there we have a second pandemic in late fall
[1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:59.240]  in which case all voting has to be by mail-in ballot we know where that goes
[1:51:59.240 --> 1:52:00.160]  don't we
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:03.880]  so that's right all the leftists are already their top people are leaking
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:06.920]  will be a new pandemic in a few months to shut down the election they're
[1:52:06.920 --> 1:52:08.800]  actually saying that
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:12.520]  yeah no it's uh... it's gates is has already said they'll be another
[1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:14.000]  pandemic uh...
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:17.640]  tony fouches they're all saying it because it's in the plan
[1:52:17.640 --> 1:52:21.920]  uh... how readily people accept their bs this time in their masks
[1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:24.600]  and their regimentation remains to be seen
[1:52:24.600 --> 1:52:26.900]  how did the last one work out
[1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:28.920]  all of the vaccination doesn't
[1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:30.800]  prevent your being infected
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:35.120]  with the virus and all by the way you get spike proteins that could kill you
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:37.720]  so uh... that hasn't worked out too well
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:42.400]  and when you need a booster shot no now you now you need for booster shots
[1:52:42.400 --> 1:52:48.000]  so so the first shot did what other than poison you
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:52.160]  what else do you see in the crystal ball roger there's so much happening
[1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.000]  well i i really think that that that what you see is that house democrats are
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:57.120]  hysterical
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:01.480]  they want to make sure that i'm from cannot run again they're so petrified
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:05.320]  their memories of him in twenty twelve and twenty uh... six to probably twenty
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:07.560]  sixteen and twenty twenty
[1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:12.960]  uh... and their their their political judgment gets clouded by their absolute
[1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:17.680]  hatred for a lot of say they're in the new york times watching post saying
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:19.720]  biden is ordering
[1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:23.560]  merrick garland to arrest is political opposition if you're gonna try that you
[1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:26.840]  don't announce it like they did it's crazy
[1:53:26.840 --> 1:53:31.200]  well it is uh... biden is obviously used a weasel words but the house
[1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:32.320]  democrats
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:35.160]  release their report in their report they said that
[1:53:35.160 --> 1:53:37.440]  white house a peter navarro
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:41.440]  suggested to mark meadows chief staff and call roger stone the days before
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:42.600]  january sixth
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:46.680]  and they wish to this day they wish to question mister navarro about this
[1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:49.280]  as well as mister stone
[1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:52.520]  since i haven't talked to peter navarro in three years
[1:53:52.520 --> 1:53:55.640]  uh... since i've never spoken to mark meadows in my life
[1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:57.680]  as he gives you perfect example
[1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:00.760]  uh... of the dead end and they use this kind of
[1:54:00.760 --> 1:54:03.240]  guilt by association i mean yes
[1:54:03.240 --> 1:54:08.520]  i was guarded by members of the of the uh... outkeepers that's because when i
[1:54:08.520 --> 1:54:12.760]  tried to hire the off-duty dc police officers that i normally used
[1:54:12.760 --> 1:54:15.640]  for security they were on available
[1:54:15.640 --> 1:54:19.280]  uh... the off-keepers provided their services for free to a number of the
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:20.320]  speakers
[1:54:20.320 --> 1:54:22.520]  they were polite uh... and brief
[1:54:22.520 --> 1:54:27.080]  roger let me ask you this in closing
[1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:30.600]  trump is more popular than ever obviously without bad bikes doing
[1:54:30.600 --> 1:54:34.360]  what are they gonna do because i mean you you said a long time ago
[1:54:34.360 --> 1:54:37.840]  trump wasn't going to run again now he says he is clearly he is
[1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:40.080]  what is the established going to do
[1:54:40.080 --> 1:54:42.480]  as as trump's popularity goes up
[1:54:42.480 --> 1:54:45.600]  because their policies are destroying the country
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:47.400]  what are they going to do
[1:54:47.400 --> 1:54:51.040]  they want to indict down from but this could not be clear they want to charge
[1:54:51.040 --> 1:54:52.320]  him says about
[1:54:52.320 --> 1:54:54.880]  roger stoner alex jones or
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:54:58.880]  both keepers of the proud boys of mark meadows or or
[1:54:58.880 --> 1:55:01.680]  or contraina piercer any of these people
[1:55:01.680 --> 1:55:03.760]  this is this is about
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:08.720]  targeting and taking down from so that would disqualify him
[1:55:08.720 --> 1:55:12.080]  uh... from running again there that petrified trump is a
[1:55:12.080 --> 1:55:13.720]  force of nature he is
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:14.800]  despite
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:16.400]  errors here and there
[1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:20.080]  he's had the globalists on the run for four years that's why they don't want
[1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:21.640]  him back under any
[1:55:21.640 --> 1:55:22.920]  circumstances
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:26.280]  so this is all about destroying trump and trying to
[1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:29.640]  to uh... that this is a process you and i've talked about before
[1:55:29.640 --> 1:55:33.920]  anytime an idea no matter how ridiculous absurd or incorrect
[1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:36.420]  reaches critical mass on twitter
[1:55:36.420 --> 1:55:40.120]  the intelligentsia at the new york times in the washington post
[1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:43.880]  begin or and pardon the washington post in the new york times the wall street
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:46.800]  journal start returning this bs
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.960]  and that makes it a factoid now people who are in government
[1:55:50.960 --> 1:55:55.000]  who are prosecutors are they read this and they read enough times they begin
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.200]  to believe that it is a fact
[1:55:57.200 --> 1:55:58.600]  so mother's
[1:55:58.600 --> 1:56:01.080]  gang of thugs actually thought i was
[1:56:01.080 --> 1:56:05.560]  uh... consortium with uh... with uh... the guys at wikileaks and julie
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:06.400]  nissange
[1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:08.400]  as you know alex i wasn't
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:11.200]  but they were sure they would find the evidence except for
[1:56:11.200 --> 1:56:12.240]  they didn't
[1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:14.440]  because it is didn't exist
[1:56:14.440 --> 1:56:18.120]  well roger thank you so much for the time stone cold truth dot com

[1:58:22.840 --> 1:58:26.840]  signing up here's the background volto wireless began with the idea of we want
[1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:30.120]  people to be free and so we want them to be able to have their privacy back
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:32.520]  so the first thing we looked at is what's the most important thing in free
[1:58:32.520 --> 1:58:35.600]  speech what's it's free communication the ability to share information with
[1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:37.880]  one another and so the first thing we did was we worked on an encrypted
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:41.320]  messenger and you know as we've seen everybody last year was talking about
[1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:45.680]  how signal was the biggest thing for secure communications you need to get
[1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:49.520]  encrypted messenger you go get signal signal uses basic end-to-end encryption
[1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:52.840]  they're using an open-source piece of code and low and behold you know we
[1:58:52.840 --> 1:58:55.960]  discovered of course that the fbi and frankly other government agencies have
[1:58:55.960 --> 1:58:59.400]  figured out how to hack that code you know the next step then it's okay well
[1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:02.400]  how do you improve upon that well we developed our own encrypted messenger
[1:59:02.400 --> 1:59:07.080]  which allows you to do calls messaging file transfer and also voice and video
[1:59:07.080 --> 1:59:10.800]  calls both with up to a thousand people at the same time and he uses three layers
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:15.840]  at 256 bit encryption that's huge I'm told oh yeah three layers so three layers
[1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:20.260]  you two 256 bit encryption is what the NSA uses to communicate top-secret
[1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:26.040]  materials three layers at 256 bit encryption it takes every super
[1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:30.440]  computer in the world more than a million years to break through three layers
[1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:34.240]  at 256 bit encryption essentially the computing power does not exist in the
[1:59:34.240 --> 1:59:37.520]  world today to hack through that you're doing trailblazing stuff people should
[1:59:37.520 --> 1:59:41.800]  really go there now even an idiot like me can sign up for a volt wireless comm
