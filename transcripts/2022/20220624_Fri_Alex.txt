[00:00.000 --> 00:02.060]  you
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.060]  you
[01:00.400 --> 01:02.400]  you
[01:14.640 --> 01:22.440]  Jones are just an act. He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist. Alex Jones is a fake
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.920]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid
[01:26.920 --> 01:31.520]  And it's all based on custody battle my ex-wife five years ago
[01:31.720 --> 01:37.000]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before like the Joker being
[01:37.320 --> 01:44.300]  Sarcastic saying take your prozac kids take your illegal drugs, too. You'll die. It's fun. So people wouldn't take drugs
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.840]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence. They look he's insane telling kids to use drugs
[01:48.840 --> 01:53.400]  And my lawyer went when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker
[01:53.400 --> 01:58.040]  No one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson. So, yeah, when I've been Cobra commander
[01:59.520 --> 02:01.280]  Or Optimus Prime
[02:01.280 --> 02:06.800]  Autobots, let's roll or the Joker because I can do imitations of them all really good or Darth Vader
[02:06.800 --> 02:09.280]  Don't act so surprised globalist
[02:09.800 --> 02:13.320]  You didn't think you could silence the American people did you?
[02:14.360 --> 02:18.480]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader? No, do I think I'm Optimus Prime?
[02:18.480 --> 02:24.960]  I'm a commander the Joker no and clearly no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire
[02:25.320 --> 02:31.520]  That what I'm saying is what I really think no one believes the Babylon be it's not trying to lie to you
[02:31.520 --> 02:38.360]  It's being sarcastic by the vaccinate me Elmo doll today. It's required by the CDC, but they play those games
[02:39.120 --> 02:44.000]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to even though I tell people okay. This is a joke
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.060]  This isn't serious. They clip it out, and they say no
[02:48.920 --> 02:55.360]  This is what he really believes every day when I leave work. I do this that man's breathless, and they go look
[02:55.360 --> 03:01.160]  He admitted in court. He's an actor. Well. Yeah, I was an actor in scanner darkly. I was an actor in waking life
[03:01.160 --> 03:04.440]  I was an actor when I was Cobra commander
[03:06.240 --> 03:12.000]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones the talk show host up here reading news articles to you
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.840]  Isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying and you know that
[03:16.160 --> 03:22.880]  You're insulted right now. I'm even explaining that to you and so am I but that's who these people are
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.120]  You don't know the power of the dark side
[03:28.080 --> 03:30.080]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[03:30.080 --> 03:45.640]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented. He's smart. He's funny as hell. It's truly funny. I'm kind of retarded
[03:45.640 --> 03:48.040]  Now that I've done those imitations
[03:48.600 --> 03:55.600]  Those little jokes you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article
[03:55.600 --> 04:02.960]  By dr. Joseph McCullough on info wars.com. It has all the site information the latest tragedy sudden adult death syndrome
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.200]  No, that's a real thing
[04:05.440 --> 04:10.760]  That's something happening in the real world and that's what we're breaking down here today. I
[04:11.520 --> 04:15.160]  Am Alex Jones and I am the guy on this show every day
[04:15.160 --> 04:32.760]  I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it
[04:32.760 --> 04:34.760]  past the earth creatures
[04:34.760 --> 04:46.080]  Ladies and gentlemen a day that will live in infamy for the bloodthirsty left Friday June 24th
[04:46.960 --> 04:48.960]  2022 Roe v. Wade overturned
[04:49.600 --> 04:57.800]  Restrictions on the second amendment overturned and more and the left is vowing violence and vengeance big broadcast straight ahead stay with us
[04:57.800 --> 05:07.960]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated?
[05:08.080 --> 05:11.840]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming
[05:11.840 --> 05:18.240]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about is going to become more important than ever
[05:18.480 --> 05:23.800]  Because the globalist aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents
[05:23.800 --> 05:28.840]  It's now out on the open Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[05:29.360 --> 05:32.600]  The Bilderberg group founded Davos group. So now
[05:33.200 --> 05:38.320]  The fight's out in the open. They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule
[05:38.320 --> 05:41.280]  We're gonna win this thing. God's watching the children counting on us
[05:41.280 --> 05:46.760]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you
[05:47.080 --> 05:48.560]  Info wars would not be here
[05:48.560 --> 05:54.840]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance
[05:54.840 --> 06:00.320]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts
[06:02.160 --> 06:05.320]  It's a big day Friday, June 24
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.320]  22
[06:09.320 --> 06:30.880]  It's for wars tomorrow's news today
[06:39.640 --> 06:41.640]  Oh
[06:41.960 --> 06:43.960]  They're scared
[06:44.680 --> 06:46.680]  Freedom is rising
[06:47.400 --> 06:49.080]  Human
[06:49.080 --> 06:51.080]  Intention is increasing
[06:51.880 --> 06:53.880]  Humanity is awakening from their coma
[06:53.880 --> 07:08.480]  And those that love death are in a violent panic
[07:08.480 --> 07:23.600]  So what's happened here on this historic Friday edition?
[07:24.240 --> 07:31.360]  Why did the Supreme Court do the right thing and overturn Roe v. Wade just under the Constitution to kick it back to the states?
[07:32.480 --> 07:34.240]  Well a lot of reasons
[07:34.240 --> 07:36.720]  But the big one is that we have
[07:36.720 --> 07:44.560]  3d modeling and 3d scans in HD for now 20 plus years of babies in the womb
[07:45.360 --> 07:48.240]  Suck on their thumbs and even two three months playing
[07:49.160 --> 07:56.400]  Dancing and we know that's a human and statistics show. But yeah, the baby boomers are still 5050 pro death
[07:57.120 --> 08:02.640]  But below the age of 30. It's over 75 to 80 percent of people and it's intensifying
[08:03.360 --> 08:05.360]  with the youngest generation
[08:05.360 --> 08:07.360]  Waking up and being anti-abortion
[08:08.160 --> 08:14.720]  And then you've got the pro-abortion crowd saying it's a satanic sacrament in court
[08:16.080 --> 08:21.440]  Saying we're gonna kill those little bastards wearing shirts celebrating. Yeah, I killed my baby. I'm gonna kill more
[08:22.160 --> 08:26.560]  And really showing us how sick and evil they are and their cult of death
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.360]  And so that's a big part of it as well and the Supreme Court's far from perfect
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.600]  But as Clarence Thomas said today north is still north south is still south
[08:38.240 --> 08:40.240]  this is
[08:40.640 --> 08:43.040]  Reality ladies and gentlemen
[08:43.680 --> 08:45.680]  Now it's not a total overturn
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.920]  Of roby wade saying that it's illegal
[08:48.720 --> 08:55.200]  It's simply saying it goes back to the states and Nancy Pelosi and others say that there's a paradox or a contradiction
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.440]  Or hypocrisy in the ruling that states cannot ban
[09:00.240 --> 09:02.240]  concealed carry or gun permits
[09:02.240 --> 09:04.240]  Just on a whim
[09:04.800 --> 09:06.480]  You've got to be a felon
[09:06.480 --> 09:08.480]  To be banned that really is a big overturn
[09:09.120 --> 09:15.600]  Of much of the victim disarmament that they call gun control in this country. They're saying oh look. Well, we thought that's a state right
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.280]  well
[09:17.280 --> 09:19.280]  States can't announce slavery's legal again
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.880]  States can't announce that they can take your guns states can't announce
[09:23.520 --> 09:25.520]  any of that in our republic system
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.840]  And I believe the supreme court could have outright banned abortion because it is murder
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.840]  Historically
[09:32.080 --> 09:38.640]  You see other rulings, you know saying you can't say that black people aren't human things like that by the supreme court that we all know deep down
[09:39.840 --> 09:45.520]  Is true that black people are humans and that it was wrong to say there were only two-thirds humans
[09:46.160 --> 09:47.920]  but they've gone
[09:47.920 --> 09:51.120]  90 percent of the way now and there are close to 30 states
[09:51.680 --> 09:54.640]  That are now going to heavily restrict the murder of children
[09:54.640 --> 10:02.960]  It was the left celebration of killing babies up to their due date and then multiple states like new york
[10:03.760 --> 10:07.680]  Passing laws you could kill babies for weeks after birth
[10:08.480 --> 10:10.480]  And people were like what the hell is this?
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  and finally
[10:14.080 --> 10:15.280]  started
[10:15.280 --> 10:17.280]  Waking up out of their comas
[10:18.160 --> 10:23.280]  And that's really what this is all about the left work for mega corporations that are eugenicists
[10:23.280 --> 10:29.200]  That don't want us to value human life don't want us to value our own freedoms so that none of us will stand up for ourselves
[10:29.200 --> 10:32.160]  We won't stand together, so we'll all fall
[10:33.680 --> 10:38.560]  Abortion was pushed and passed in Planned Parenthood and all of it by the Rockefellers
[10:39.520 --> 10:42.400]  by Margaret Sanger and their express goal
[10:43.920 --> 10:49.040]  Was to kill all black people and kill most white people hispanics and asians
[10:49.040 --> 10:54.240]  According to IQ tests that would be administered when children were in elementary school
[10:54.960 --> 10:59.200]  They actually called if you go back to Margaret Sanger for killing young children even
[11:00.480 --> 11:04.480]  And I can play you newscasts out of the netherlands and the uk and other places where they
[11:04.880 --> 11:11.360]  Will interview a down syndrome man and say did you know you cost society three four times what other people do and their socialist societies?
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.800]  What's the dangers post social societies they can you know put a value on human life and then devalue it
[11:16.800 --> 11:20.240]  And they say to the down syndrome man, shouldn't you just kill yourself?
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.560]  Well once we get rid of the down syndrome folks and euthanize the old people like bill gauge wants to do
[11:26.800 --> 11:32.800]  Is that really a world you want to live in? Is that a world you really think is a safe place to live?
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.240]  We have a little soiled green piece. We've been airing for about six seven years with myself in the great day of the night
[11:38.560 --> 11:44.720]  And David night is a great guy by the way, even though we had to let him go. I really admired David night really appreciate him
[11:44.720 --> 11:51.040]  And I do love him actually, but we're going to be airing that piece coming up at the start
[11:51.840 --> 11:57.840]  Of the next segment just to remind you of what this is really all about because David
[11:58.240 --> 12:02.240]  And myself and others really I think put it well, but it's the selling of the baby parts
[12:02.320 --> 12:04.160]  It's the keeping babies alive
[12:04.160 --> 12:06.160]  It is this overarching dehumanization
[12:06.640 --> 12:13.280]  Of we go out to these pro-abortion rallies and the majority of the women and men say I love satan. I love the devil and they've got
[12:13.280 --> 12:19.280]  Pentagram tattoos. They they say I kill my babies. I want to kill more babies
[12:20.640 --> 12:26.560]  This is not a minority of these people. This is the majority have converted to satanism
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.920]  And that is their operating system and they're even national
[12:30.960 --> 12:32.960]  documentaries out
[12:33.440 --> 12:35.440]  By the satanist themselves
[12:36.800 --> 12:39.920]  They just came out the last few years where they bragged that
[12:39.920 --> 12:44.080]  A large portion of democrats now identify as satanist
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.080]  And so this is about selfishness. It's about devaluing human life
[12:48.640 --> 12:56.400]  And this is a big victory for everybody that protested and spoke out and shared articles and videos and convicted other people's hearts
[12:57.040 --> 13:03.280]  About what was happening this shows in this sea of evil and corruption and collapsing borders and devalued currencies and
[13:03.680 --> 13:07.280]  pedophilia and world government attacks on the family and all of it
[13:07.280 --> 13:10.800]  But that humanity is coming back
[13:11.440 --> 13:17.280]  And that the full weight of the reality that we've got to have a turning point where we start reversing course
[13:18.400 --> 13:22.720]  And we're beginning to see this big ship start to turn around the question is
[13:23.200 --> 13:29.520]  Will it be too little too late? Well, it never will be because this life is a test re-eternal beings made by god
[13:30.160 --> 13:31.200]  and
[13:31.200 --> 13:38.880]  What matters is the choice not even what happens to you physically in the equation of life on this planet temporarily
[13:39.280 --> 13:41.600]  But what matters spiritually and
[13:42.720 --> 13:47.840]  Eternally forever, so i want to thank you all for joining us on this very important friday edition
[13:48.320 --> 13:52.080]  We already have judge brown joining us one of my favorite guests
[13:52.800 --> 13:54.160]  to cover
[13:54.160 --> 13:57.760]  The weaponization of the judiciary and more but now he will be able to get
[13:57.760 --> 14:01.600]  Uh into these big supreme court rulings as well judge joe brown
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.120]  Is going to be on the third hour jacob engels who helped break and really first exposed the guy that almost beat the fraud
[14:09.920 --> 14:15.440]  Governor to sanis a few years ago now indicted that's important to have a look at he'll be joining us for 30 minutes
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.160]  The bottom of the next hour, but i intend and i will
[14:19.440 --> 14:21.280]  at the bottom of the hour
[14:21.280 --> 14:25.840]  To give the number out specifically on roe v. Wade and what do you think of this?
[14:25.840 --> 14:32.880]  And what do you think the pitfalls are and what do you think the left's going to do next valing violence and vengeance and insurrection all across
[14:33.840 --> 14:35.200]  the united states
[14:35.200 --> 14:37.680]  Open phones on one subject
[14:38.240 --> 14:40.880]  And that is the roe v. Wade being overturned and then if you
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.760]  Humor me and give me your comment on that that i'd also like you to add the caveat
[14:46.560 --> 14:48.240]  Or the dessert
[14:48.240 --> 14:51.920]  And give us your view on the major second amendment ruling overturning new york
[14:51.920 --> 14:57.280]  Not letting folks have concealed carry unless they could give them enough campaign contributions and kiss their ass
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.240]  Oh, sorry, you run a liquor store or sorry
[15:00.240 --> 15:03.840]  You're a guy that works in your own company overnight at a factory
[15:03.840 --> 15:04.960]  You can't have a gun
[15:04.960 --> 15:09.920]  But the political ruling class they can have bodyguards many cases paid for by the citizens
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.120]  So we're going to fire up the phone system. It's not turned on yet
[15:13.600 --> 15:16.240]  We're going to turn the phone system on at the start of the next segment
[15:16.880 --> 15:20.320]  And this will be for first time callers today
[15:20.320 --> 15:24.320]  I want to hear from you. We're gonna take a lot of your calls. I just want your view on it
[15:24.320 --> 15:25.680]  I move to the next person
[15:25.680 --> 15:27.920]  So I'm gonna let callers stay on four or five minutes and that's great
[15:28.320 --> 15:32.240]  Today you get one minute because I want to load up this phone board
[15:32.560 --> 15:35.120]  And I want to take your calls bang bang bang
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.960]  And then there's all the other news man. Joe biden came out and blamed gas stations for gas prices
[15:41.280 --> 15:42.960]  You know the putin thing
[15:42.960 --> 15:44.560]  was alive, but
[15:44.560 --> 15:47.760]  A small part of the increase was the war which nato started
[15:47.760 --> 15:54.720]  But to blame gas stations for the prices when they may be making 20 cents a gallon or something just to keep their doors open
[15:54.960 --> 15:57.520]  That is unbelievable misdirection. We're right back
[15:59.600 --> 16:01.280]  Ladies and gentlemen
[16:01.280 --> 16:06.720]  In the last 30 months, we've witnessed the globalists hit humanity and hit humanity extremely hard

[16:59.920 --> 17:02.480]  At this point best case scenario
[17:02.480 --> 17:09.760]  Is a few years of hard times for us all and if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse
[17:10.560 --> 17:14.320]  But as bad as things are we still have time to prepare
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.920]  And that alone is something to be grateful for a gravity water filter will provide you with clean healthy water
[17:22.400 --> 17:25.200]  Even in the event of your taps getting shut off
[17:25.840 --> 17:30.720]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government fema camps
[17:30.720 --> 17:37.600]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors

[18:59.840 --> 19:03.760]  There is very little contemporary study in the world
[19:04.400 --> 19:06.400]  of the planet's ruling class
[19:06.640 --> 19:09.120]  Not in communist china not in mexico
[19:09.760 --> 19:11.760]  Not in the united states not anywhere
[19:12.400 --> 19:14.400]  Is there a real study
[19:14.400 --> 19:16.960]  Of the planet's ruling class and that's done by design
[19:17.760 --> 19:23.040]  The large central banks that basically control the planet will penalize and target any academics
[19:23.920 --> 19:26.560]  That look into say the anglo-american establishment
[19:27.040 --> 19:32.800]  The founder of the builder bird group the trilateral commission of the united nations the whole project of the ross shawls and the rock folks
[19:33.680 --> 19:38.640]  Until 10 years ago the media said the control corporate media of the builder bird group didn't exist
[19:39.440 --> 19:42.080]  Well now the builder bird group is public and its former head
[19:42.080 --> 19:48.000]  So the steering committee is called schwaab and he has set up the great reset in global government
[19:48.400 --> 19:52.400]  And if as a liberty movement worldwide, we don't address the globalist head on
[19:53.120 --> 19:58.960]  About the second figure worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover. We don't have a shot. If you expose them, we can beat em easily
[19:58.960 --> 20:13.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's alex jones
[20:16.320 --> 20:20.640]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat the uk hospitals
[20:21.840 --> 20:25.760]  Silent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people
[20:25.760 --> 20:29.200]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace
[20:29.840 --> 20:37.120]  In order to fuel hospitals in the uk they're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity
[20:42.080 --> 20:46.960]  The powdered flesh from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease
[20:47.360 --> 20:49.360]  Because of its enormous popularity
[20:49.680 --> 20:51.680]  Soil and green is in short supply
[20:51.680 --> 21:00.480]  Remember, Tuesday is soiling green day. The supply of soiling green has been exhausted. You must evacuate the area
[21:04.080 --> 21:10.240]  That the shareholders of pepsico big builder bird group company are not allowed to know
[21:11.200 --> 21:14.960]  Uh what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know
[21:15.600 --> 21:17.600]  So enjoy the flavor
[21:17.600 --> 21:23.840]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes. I'm consistently pro-death
[21:24.160 --> 21:29.040]  I'm for assisted suicide. I'm for regular suicide. I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving
[21:29.200 --> 21:32.960]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient?
[21:33.520 --> 21:38.000]  Would it be better not to lay off the those 10 teachers and
[21:38.640 --> 21:42.240]  To make that trade up in medical costs, but that's called the death panel
[21:42.800 --> 21:44.800]  Uh, and you're not supposed to have that discussion
[21:44.800 --> 21:48.000]  They told me to uh to say that they were sorry
[21:49.040 --> 21:51.440]  But that you had become unreliable
[21:59.440 --> 22:04.480]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its children
[22:04.880 --> 22:08.880]  Will do it to its senior citizens. It will do it to its dissidents
[22:08.880 --> 22:15.280]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the
[22:15.680 --> 22:18.320]  Quizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible
[22:18.880 --> 22:21.440]  This is nothing but a suicide cult
[22:22.080 --> 22:24.080]  The scoops are on their way
[22:24.240 --> 22:26.240]  The scoops are on their way
[22:26.720 --> 22:29.280]  I repeat the scoops are on their way
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.320]  You will find out why soylent green means life. You will find out why soylent green means death
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.120]  We've got to stop them. Come on
[22:39.120 --> 22:41.120]  That is my secret love
[22:41.680 --> 22:43.440]  Soylent green
[22:43.440 --> 22:45.440]  Silent green is people
[22:48.880 --> 22:54.000]  Each thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food. You gotta tell them
[22:58.560 --> 23:04.160]  Shockwave says the drugs report Roe v. Wade overturned what will be the crazed demonic lefts
[23:04.160 --> 23:06.960]  Response drunk on the blood of children
[23:07.440 --> 23:09.920]  Leaving their sacrament may be taken away from them
[23:10.480 --> 23:16.560]  We're taking your calls 877-789-2539 877-789-Alex
[23:17.280 --> 23:20.640]  Again 877-789-2539
[23:21.360 --> 23:24.080]  First-time callers here in the next segment
[23:25.040 --> 23:28.320]  What is your quick take view on this and where it's going?
[23:29.120 --> 23:31.120]  and what comes next
[23:31.120 --> 23:36.240]  A lot of hard work's gone into exposing this. We're not there yet. We're getting close and obviously people will still
[23:36.800 --> 23:39.440]  Go to other states to have these abortions. They'll go to other countries
[23:39.920 --> 23:44.880]  But we as a people are rejecting it and saying we know it's evil. We know it's murder
[23:45.440 --> 23:49.920]  Particularly third trimester and now trying to keep babies alive and now kill the old people
[23:50.240 --> 23:52.960]  We see the slippery slope. We know we've gone over the edge of it
[23:53.280 --> 23:57.840]  And there are the arguments they have for early abortions if they were really just doing it
[23:57.840 --> 24:03.760]  Because the person's poor or they were raped or whatever, but that's the excuse. That's very rare
[24:05.360 --> 24:10.720]  It's done because they love death and devaluing humans. And so you have to make a choice. Do you value human life or do you not?
[24:12.400 --> 24:14.240]  This is a big deal
[24:14.240 --> 24:16.640]  This is a very very big deal and I want to explain something
[24:17.600 --> 24:19.120]  I never
[24:19.120 --> 24:21.120]  judge people that have had abortions
[24:21.360 --> 24:23.600]  I was extremely promiscuous when I was young
[24:24.240 --> 24:26.560]  and did not have any trouble with the ladies
[24:26.560 --> 24:28.560]  and I
[24:28.880 --> 24:31.600]  Though I did not try to get women pregnant. I got a lot of women pregnant
[24:32.240 --> 24:33.680]  and I
[24:33.680 --> 24:37.200]  Had been involved in a lot of abortions and a lot of women. I know I got pregnant
[24:37.680 --> 24:40.240]  Uh had abortions and everybody really told me about it till later
[24:40.960 --> 24:44.160]  And it's wrong and my dad confronted me when I was about
[24:45.280 --> 24:49.520]  18 years old. I just moved out. I said I got a job. I need some more money
[24:50.320 --> 24:51.760]  and he was like
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.400]  My god, I just gave you money for an abortion a month ago. What is your problem?
[24:57.040 --> 25:00.560]  Stop killing my grandchildren. I'm like, well, how'd you even know that's why I need money?
[25:01.200 --> 25:03.200]  And he was just like you're out of control
[25:03.440 --> 25:05.040]  You got to stop it
[25:05.040 --> 25:08.640]  and my heart really got convicted about that and and I was uh
[25:11.120 --> 25:14.400]  Actually sell it for several years and really launched my operations
[25:15.040 --> 25:20.640]  After that and and as soon as I stopped just chasing women around every day at all times basically
[25:20.640 --> 25:22.160]  um
[25:22.160 --> 25:24.160]  then
[25:25.360 --> 25:27.360]  My mission basically
[25:27.680 --> 25:32.880]  Materialized in front of me and that was the beginning of so many great things and I've got four wonderful children today
[25:33.280 --> 25:35.600]  And I look at my children. I love them more than life itself
[25:35.680 --> 25:39.760]  I would die for them in a second and I just imagine all those children I threw away
[25:40.400 --> 25:46.400]  And so I'm not judging people who believed it wasn't really a human and believed it was a blob of tissue and believed it was just a choice
[25:46.480 --> 25:48.480]  like I did
[25:48.480 --> 25:50.480]  God will forgive you
[25:50.560 --> 25:53.520]  Just say you're sorry and you were wrong and a huge weight will be lifted off of you
[25:53.840 --> 25:57.280]  But if you harden your heart and say I don't care
[25:57.680 --> 25:59.120]  I'm going to keep doing it
[25:59.120 --> 26:02.880]  You will be turned over to evil and the people that are involved in abortion
[26:03.520 --> 26:04.320]  are
[26:04.320 --> 26:05.920]  turned over
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.120]  To evil ladies and gentlemen and you see the satanic fruits of what they do euthanasia
[26:11.840 --> 26:13.840]  keeping babies alive selling their organs
[26:13.840 --> 26:17.680]  I told Joe Rogan about that four years ago in studio became a big national story
[26:19.600 --> 26:22.160]  People went and looked into it and found it was true. Of course it was true
[26:22.960 --> 26:25.920]  And now that's come out and convicted everybody's hearts
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.240]  And america is saying no to being part of this
[26:31.040 --> 26:35.840]  And it is a beautiful beautiful beautiful thing that has happened
[26:36.960 --> 26:38.960]  Now obviously the timing of this
[26:38.960 --> 26:43.680]  We'll energize the left for these elections and the lefts can engage in a lot of violence
[26:43.680 --> 26:47.280]  And I would imagine if I was them thinking of their evil processes
[26:47.600 --> 26:51.120]  I've got them dead to rights. I've got their number. They'll stage some false flags now
[26:51.360 --> 26:56.880]  bombings mass shootings at abortion clinics to blame on us and to try to legitimize their culture of death
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.640]  And what they're doing and their armies of their you know pedo mask
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.360]  Antifa running around
[27:03.440 --> 27:06.560]  Working for the big banks working for the eugenicists working for the establishment
[27:06.560 --> 27:10.320]  So the fight is far from over but there is a fight happening
[27:10.560 --> 27:17.440]  And we're not just rolling over and letting these monsters continue to kill our unborn and our born and our old folks and
[27:18.960 --> 27:23.840]  That's the good news. The bad news is the globalists know they're losing the fight in america to disarm us
[27:24.400 --> 27:26.400]  They know they're losing the fight against abortion
[27:27.280 --> 27:28.320]  child murder
[27:28.320 --> 27:33.600]  And so they've just moved on to the poison vaccine to depopulate us and the gmo and the nano tech in the food
[27:33.600 --> 27:39.040]  And all the stuff that's happening the 5g on that front. So while we're battling this fight
[27:39.440 --> 27:44.240]  While we're in this war, which is important realize they've already moved on to other forms of attack
[27:44.320 --> 27:49.120]  We need to be fully aware of all of that and we have that news and information as well
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.880]  But your phone calls paul quarry adrian will paul and many others
[27:55.920 --> 28:00.960]  Your calls are coming up on the other side of this break separately. I'm going to hit this before we go to calls
[28:00.960 --> 28:07.360]  biden is given a script and there's actual photos of this that came out a year ago, but now they have hd of it
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Of the script he's given
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.280]  Walk in sit down say this do that like he's a trained seal or a trained dog. I mean that's
[28:16.560 --> 28:18.400]  What this is you talk about pump it. This is it
[28:18.960 --> 28:23.600]  But he has now done something that takes the cake and remember he's being given this to say
[28:24.320 --> 28:26.320]  That it's the gas station's fault
[28:26.320 --> 28:32.080]  That gas prices are like this and they're playing on ignorance of the general population
[28:32.160 --> 28:35.120]  They think that people don't know how this works at gas stations
[28:35.280 --> 28:39.840]  But I actually know people that own gas stations have had family that own gas stations and he's texas
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.120]  I know the business and for those that don't know i'm gonna give you a little secret
[28:43.520 --> 28:48.080]  Most gas stations lose money on gas, but that's how they get you in the convenience store to buy
[28:49.200 --> 28:52.160]  Food and drinks and things like that, you know hot dogs pizza or whatever
[28:52.160 --> 28:55.920]  So this is a giant lie. We'll cover that straight ahead stay with us
[28:59.760 --> 29:04.160]  There's an old bed of one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this
[29:04.880 --> 29:06.160]  Trust in god

[29:16.560 --> 29:21.920]  But also try to roll away. You can't just sit there like a jellyfish and it's the same thing with our immune system

[33:34.320 --> 33:35.920]  restaurants
[33:35.920 --> 33:40.080]  And then when conservatives do it politely they call us terrorists. Well now she's out in front of the supreme court
[33:40.640 --> 33:43.680]  Calling people to hit the streets ladies and gentlemen. Here she is
[33:44.480 --> 33:46.480]  You see this turn out here
[33:46.720 --> 33:48.720]  You ain't seen nothing yet
[33:49.360 --> 33:54.800]  Women are going to control their bodies no matter how they try and stop us
[33:54.800 --> 34:01.280]  They held with the supreme court. We will defy them women will be in control of their bodies
[34:01.520 --> 34:10.240]  And if they think black women are intimidated or afraid they got another thought coming black women will be out in droves
[34:10.640 --> 34:14.160]  We will be out by the thousands. We will be out by the millions
[34:14.400 --> 34:21.440]  We're going to make sure we fight by the right to control our own bodies. Thank you. Hello everybody
[34:21.440 --> 34:24.240]  Hey, that's right. We'll kill as many black people as we can
[34:25.200 --> 34:27.200]  as we're so pro-black
[34:28.560 --> 34:33.680]  Unbelievable mind control and you're gonna keep the babies alive too and sell their organs
[34:41.920 --> 34:44.560]  Let me add this women are not fighting alone
[34:45.120 --> 34:47.600]  There are men who have wives and daughters
[34:47.600 --> 34:52.480]  There are men who respect women and there will be men in this fight with women
[34:52.720 --> 34:57.840]  This is not over. It's just a genesis of a new beginning. Look at that kook out there wearing his mask
[34:57.920 --> 34:59.920]  What a cult of freakazoids
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  Oh, they murder us with these poison shots
[35:02.960 --> 35:05.360]  All right, let me go to your phone calls. But first I want to hit this
[35:06.560 --> 35:08.560]  Biden
[35:08.640 --> 35:10.640]  reads off a teleprompter
[35:10.640 --> 35:14.560]  Biden has given a script it came out his first week's in office a year and a half ago
[35:14.560 --> 35:18.560]  He would wave papers around people could freeze it and see he was being told everything to do
[35:19.200 --> 35:21.600]  Well, there's new papers out
[35:22.320 --> 35:24.320]  We've got some images of those
[35:24.720 --> 35:26.720]  Where it shows specifically
[35:28.080 --> 35:30.080]  What he's told to do like he's a dog
[35:30.960 --> 35:32.960]  You take your seat
[35:33.440 --> 35:35.440]  Very specific cheat sheet
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.000]  Reminds biden how to act and how to stay awake
[35:39.440 --> 35:41.440]  And here's the cheat sheet
[35:41.440 --> 35:44.800]  He's so dummy holds it up for everybody
[35:48.320 --> 35:54.000]  And it goes in to say you enter the Roosevelt room and say hello you take your seat
[35:56.480 --> 36:00.240]  Press enters you give brief comments and it just goes on
[36:00.880 --> 36:02.880]  press departs
[36:02.880 --> 36:07.440]  I mean you talk about mind control. So everything coming out of his mouth
[36:07.440 --> 36:11.600]  Is a prescripted thing. This is the definition
[36:12.480 --> 36:17.600]  Of a puppet. I mean he is literally a dementia addled
[36:20.480 --> 36:22.480]  Riddled creature
[36:23.200 --> 36:25.600]  And so when he says this stuff, this is not a gaffe
[36:26.560 --> 36:31.280]  This is what he's told to say. So now he says I'm really upset about gas prices
[36:31.280 --> 36:39.680]  And he points his finger at the camera will play the clip in a moment and he says gas stations. You did this. You will cut prices
[36:40.320 --> 36:46.080]  Now for anybody that doesn't know about this. It's easy to look up. You just type in most gas stations
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.720]  Lose money on gas by the time they pay for the regulations and the tanks and the maintenance and all of it on average
[36:55.760 --> 36:59.120]  They make about 25 cents a gallon because it's very competitive
[36:59.120 --> 37:02.320]  Now during hurricanes with some gas shortages sometimes
[37:02.880 --> 37:04.480]  Stations will be caught
[37:04.480 --> 37:10.880]  Charging of those lines way more and maybe they're making a dollar a gallon instead of uh, you know 15 cents a gallon
[37:11.440 --> 37:17.360]  But we're talking about people gassing up their cars with 20 gallons and maybe they make three four dollars
[37:20.720 --> 37:22.720]  I mean do you understand that
[37:23.040 --> 37:27.040]  Until recently a gallon of gas was cheaper than a gallon of water
[37:27.040 --> 37:29.040]  Because the u.s
[37:29.360 --> 37:34.720]  Was one of the top world producers in the world. We it was number one under trump now. It's number four number three
[37:34.960 --> 37:36.960]  But then I look at the numbers
[37:37.040 --> 37:38.480]  so
[37:38.480 --> 37:42.080]  Imagine they've already suspended in most states the gas tax
[37:42.720 --> 37:46.960]  And it's still at five dollars a gallon on average. It's like eight bucks a gallon in california in other areas
[37:48.640 --> 37:52.240]  Six dollars a gallon in places like hawaii, but it's a five dollar
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.880]  national average because he shut off
[37:54.880 --> 37:58.960]  Thousands of pipelines the big keystone pipeline when it was already completed
[37:59.840 --> 38:02.800]  He he cut all of the drilling permits
[38:03.120 --> 38:06.880]  He killed drilling in anwar alaska killed drilling the Gulf of mexico
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.880]  Which just means venezuela and china and everybody else just comes and drills it
[38:12.800 --> 38:15.520]  And then we buy it from venezuela and we buy it from other countries
[38:16.480 --> 38:22.080]  So for him to be the author or the front man of this and to come out and blame gas stations
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.360]  shows you a window into the minds of the controllers that they think the public's so stupid
[38:28.320 --> 38:30.720]  That they want to first misdirect and say putin did it
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.680]  Well, even the federal reserve admits that's not the case and now it's the gas station
[38:37.120 --> 38:39.120]  gas stations make their money on
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.280]  cigarettes
[38:41.280 --> 38:43.120]  and lottery tickets
[38:43.120 --> 38:51.440]  and chewing tobacco and hot pockets and honey buns and coffee and Gatorade and coca-cola
[38:51.440 --> 38:53.840]  and aspirin and lighters
[38:55.120 --> 38:56.960]  and ice cream
[38:56.960 --> 38:58.800]  and potato chips
[38:58.800 --> 39:00.800]  and magazines
[39:01.040 --> 39:05.280]  Everybody knows that that I mean that that is the bottom line
[39:07.840 --> 39:12.240]  And so gas stations couldn't operate just selling gas
[39:12.480 --> 39:16.320]  That's why you ever see places just sell gas. You don't see that anymore
[39:16.320 --> 39:21.680]  And you know you can be in small towns. They got like 80 year old gas stations and then we even have an office to sell stuff
[39:21.680 --> 39:23.680]  And they're usually closed
[39:24.240 --> 39:27.280]  You can drive all through the united states. It's the old shutdown gas stations
[39:27.360 --> 39:31.200]  They have that little bitty office and little bitty place or maybe they sell cigarettes and oil
[39:33.040 --> 39:36.640]  Those places are out of business because you can't run a business
[39:38.000 --> 39:44.000]  In the gas station business the convenience store business off gasoline you will go bankrupt before you ever start
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.440]  And here's the president of the United States with his controllers
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.480]  Loading up in his notes and his teleprompter to tell you and to tell me
[39:54.400 --> 40:02.800]  That I'm ordering you right now to lower gas prices when his policies are the direct cause of every stinking bit of the increase
[40:03.040 --> 40:05.840]  unbelievable
[40:07.840 --> 40:10.720]  Absolutely incredible. Yeah, there's NBC news
[40:10.720 --> 40:17.120]  The others NBC news station owners make most their profits in the stores and sells the food and drinks as well as alcohol
[40:17.440 --> 40:19.440]  or sales are legal
[40:20.240 --> 40:23.680]  That's a known fact, but they think you're so stupid
[40:25.680 --> 40:30.400]  That they're now going with that in the news. Well, he's right. It's the it's the gas stations
[40:31.600 --> 40:33.600]  He tried to blame the oil companies last week
[40:33.600 --> 40:40.320]  And there is some evidence that since increased prices went up and inflation they have now started charging about 10% more than they should
[40:40.880 --> 40:45.040]  But view the actuaries. I'm not defending oil companies, but they know the price is going up in the future
[40:45.280 --> 40:49.040]  So they're adding that in for the future cost delivery of goods. So
[40:49.600 --> 40:55.280]  No, ladies and gentlemen when Trump told oil companies you lower prices when Trump they said, yes, sir, let us increase output and it plunged
[40:58.240 --> 41:00.480]  Because the president has power when he's not a puppet he
[41:00.480 --> 41:06.080]  Biden could be directing all this i'm going to go to break and take your calls, but here is uh, biden and and and the biggest lie ever
[41:06.400 --> 41:08.400]  The company's running gas stations
[41:09.040 --> 41:11.040]  And setting those prices at the pump
[41:11.760 --> 41:13.760]  This is a time of war
[41:14.080 --> 41:15.600]  global peril
[41:15.600 --> 41:16.880]  Ukraine
[41:16.880 --> 41:18.880]  These are not normal times
[41:19.440 --> 41:25.120]  Bring down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you are paying for the product
[41:25.840 --> 41:27.360]  Do it now
[41:27.360 --> 41:28.640]  Do it now
[41:28.640 --> 41:30.640]  Do it now do it today
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.480]  Your customers the american people they need relief now
[41:37.680 --> 41:39.680]  So let me summarize
[41:39.920 --> 41:46.160]  So he can flip a switch and say we're now pro-energy like trump did and governing the third biggest producer to number one overnight
[41:46.160 --> 41:50.880]  Just flip a switch the old companies and the wildcatters and our people can do it like that
[41:51.840 --> 41:53.840]  The infrastructure is still there though. It's falling apart
[41:53.840 --> 42:01.280]  I've talked to a lot of people that work in the oilfields in the refineries. They say of thanks for tuning in for another year
[42:02.080 --> 42:07.200]  They won't be able to up capacity for a decade, but it's still in place right now within months. They get lower gas prices
[42:07.200 --> 42:10.080]  He is in direct control of those levers
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.480]  And he blames the gas stations. I mean that is that is just so insulting
[42:17.760 --> 42:22.880]  And he sits there all sanctimonious like he cares, but you know, there's probably 20 percent of people
[42:22.880 --> 42:26.080]  Democrats they they they stay in power by election friday knows that it's all come out
[42:27.600 --> 42:33.840]  But there's about 20 25 percent of people that would believe the moon was made out of pistachio ice cream
[42:35.040 --> 42:37.040]  if he told them so
[42:37.200 --> 42:42.160]  They would believe anything and they're like, yeah, it's the gas stations. Hey, they're the ones
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.640]  They're the reason the price went up not that he blocked the drilling and the refining and the delivery of the stuff
[42:48.640 --> 42:56.720]  Man, these people are sick. They told you it was all coming three years ago. Your calls are straight ahead info wars dot com tomorrow's news today
[42:59.520 --> 43:06.640]  The internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan Alex Jones was right people ask what's it like to be vindicated?
[43:07.040 --> 43:10.560]  Well, it's actually very sick feeling because I knew this was coming
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.400]  I tried to stop it and now everything I've talked about
[43:14.400 --> 43:22.480]  Is going to become more important than ever because the globalists aren't hiding anymore in policy reports and documents
[43:22.640 --> 43:27.680]  It's now out in the open claus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth
[43:28.320 --> 43:30.320]  The bill der berg group founded davos group
[43:30.880 --> 43:32.240]  so now
[43:32.240 --> 43:33.840]  The fight's out in the open
[43:33.840 --> 43:38.000]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule. We're going to win this thing
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.160]  God's watching the children counting on us
[43:40.160 --> 43:45.440]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support because without you
[43:45.920 --> 43:47.360]  Info wars would not be here
[43:47.360 --> 43:50.640]  So I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[43:51.120 --> 43:53.600]  And you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance
[43:53.840 --> 43:59.040]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done and ask you now to redouble your efforts
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.400]  So when I first started taking survival skills, basically I was 275 pounds. I was overweight
[44:04.480 --> 44:08.480]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe I was barely holding on to a job
[44:08.480 --> 44:11.200]  And I heard dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[44:11.280 --> 44:15.680]  So the first one I got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good
[44:15.840 --> 44:18.000]  And then shortly thereafter you came out with x2
[44:18.080 --> 44:23.200]  You have you know with a deep virgin source, you know, and I got really excited about that so I took it and man in two weeks
[44:23.360 --> 44:29.520]  I went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened, you know, I could think again
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.080]  I could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of years
[44:34.080 --> 44:40.160]  I got my health back and I religiously take basically all of your supplements. They're all absolutely amazing supplements
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.440]  The one I like recently is knockout. It literally like if you want to sleep just take it. It's amazing. It works
[44:45.520 --> 44:48.080]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.640]  We have to break free of the globalist system
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.080]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand

[50:56.720 --> 50:58.080]  Okay
[50:58.080 --> 51:00.800]  A lot of the crazy clips, but let's go to your phone calls. We've got
[51:01.840 --> 51:03.520]  A lot of folks holding here
[51:03.520 --> 51:12.800]  We're taking calls in order they're received your response to roe v. Wade ruling by the supreme court paul give us your take on this historic decision
[51:15.520 --> 51:17.520]  Welcome paul you want to give us your take on this?
[51:18.880 --> 51:22.480]  All right, thank you paul appreciate that. All right, let's go ahead and take another call
[51:22.560 --> 51:25.280]  Let's go to adrian in missouri adrian. You're on the air
[51:26.240 --> 51:32.560]  Hi, alex. Thank you for taking my call. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for being here. What's your view on this historic decision?
[51:32.560 --> 51:36.240]  Well, I never thought this day would come. I never thought I would see it
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.640]  even after the leak
[51:38.640 --> 51:39.600]  but um
[51:39.600 --> 51:44.160]  We as believers must continue to recognize that god is fully in control of this world
[51:44.880 --> 51:46.880]  and if we believe
[51:46.880 --> 51:50.320]  That he is in control then we need to abandon the evil
[51:50.720 --> 51:55.760]  We need to abandon the sickness that's taken over this country and get back to god
[51:56.240 --> 51:59.120]  Because god will change his mind and give us a reprieve
[51:59.120 --> 52:03.840]  We just have to recognize who's in control these people
[52:04.800 --> 52:05.760]  that
[52:05.760 --> 52:12.000]  Practice this evil that's called abortion. They've done this now freely for 40 years
[52:12.400 --> 52:15.760]  Long before I even knew what it was. They've been practicing this evil
[52:16.400 --> 52:19.680]  And it's time now for god to take back
[52:20.480 --> 52:25.200]  What his life has well, that's right and even though this won't stop this overnight
[52:25.200 --> 52:30.960]  It's it's our vote and and a symbol that our government is going in the right direction
[52:31.280 --> 52:37.600]  And look how cursed we are under this evil. We will begin to be blessed as soon as we begin to make the right decisions and reverse this
[52:38.560 --> 52:46.160]  Exactly, and I'm that I'm so thankful. This is just one step. It's not the end all of everything, but it's one major step
[52:46.720 --> 52:51.760]  Thanks be to god that we may get a reprieve if we just continue to go back to god
[52:51.760 --> 52:57.760]  Thank you for taking my call alex. I appreciate everything you do. Let's keep the fight because we are at war
[52:58.240 --> 53:01.040]  And a lot of people don't realize we're at war or they don't care
[53:01.360 --> 53:05.520]  But we have been at war for a long time and you've been at the front. Thank you so much for everything
[53:05.760 --> 53:08.800]  God bless you and your beautiful words, man. We love you. Thank you so much
[53:09.120 --> 53:11.360]  Adrian for being part of the info wars family. We love you
[53:12.160 --> 53:14.640]  Let's go ahead and just go in the order they're received here
[53:14.640 --> 53:20.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to will in texas responding to this historic event. What do you think's happening?
[53:22.400 --> 53:26.000]  Hey alex. Thanks a lot first time long time big fan
[53:26.480 --> 53:33.440]  Um, I think this whole notion or endeavor of trying to legislate abortion. It's a colossal waste of time
[53:34.000 --> 53:38.240]  Um, we're never going to agree. You know, there's always political implications
[53:38.320 --> 53:40.880]  There's caveats on both sides one way or the other
[53:40.880 --> 53:48.000]  It's just a colossal waste of time. So how do we deal with that in lieu of abandoning the whole notion of abortion?
[53:48.720 --> 53:54.400]  Yeah, your name, uh, we need to draw a line of the collectively draw a line in the sand
[53:55.040 --> 53:57.280]  When that baby takes on civil rights
[53:57.760 --> 54:01.520]  So then if that baby's touched, you know molested or done anything
[54:02.080 --> 54:07.680]  Outside of that timeline then the existing laws on the book apply to that baby
[54:07.680 --> 54:16.400]  Well, uh, I get part of what you're saying, but maybe extrapolated or quantified for me. Uh, so I get fully what you're saying
[54:17.600 --> 54:19.600]  Here's what I'm getting at
[54:20.160 --> 54:26.240]  The people running the abortion operation are anti-human eugenicists. I'm not saying everybody's been part of abortions or bad
[54:26.240 --> 54:28.240]  they've been deceived
[54:28.720 --> 54:30.720]  but
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.280]  The whole move to dehumanize and devalue life is the entire globalist agenda
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.080]  So I see this as a very positive move
[54:38.640 --> 54:43.360]  I I think what you're saying is human should decide to protect children and protect the weak
[54:43.840 --> 54:49.360]  Regardless and as a culture we should be good enough and informed enough to not make bad decisions
[54:49.600 --> 54:52.160]  And then abortion would be obsolete by freedom of choice
[54:52.960 --> 54:56.880]  And that's where I'd like to see this going. That's why we're seeing this beginning of the reversal
[54:57.120 --> 55:00.720]  Because all the polls and statistics show people have had their hearts convicted
[55:00.720 --> 55:03.920]  I want to read a quote to you from the bible that you put that back on screen
[55:03.920 --> 55:07.600]  This is a very very important quote and of course, there's a longer
[55:08.000 --> 55:08.960]  Uh
[55:08.960 --> 55:11.040]  Quote in context even more important from the bible
[55:11.040 --> 55:15.200]  But if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves
[55:15.680 --> 55:19.200]  And pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways that I will
[55:20.240 --> 55:27.440]  Hear from heaven and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land is our land not diseased is our land not cursed
[55:29.280 --> 55:32.400]  I'm 100 with you Alex. I'm 100 pro lines
[55:32.400 --> 55:37.920]  But the fact of the matter is that we're not going to agree on and you know, there's always going to be caveats
[55:37.920 --> 55:44.000]  Let's say health implications incest or rape and if you make sure but they're trying to say kill babies after they're born
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.600]  That's why this is being rolled back because people now know it's not just gay marriage
[55:48.160 --> 55:51.120]  The you know, the left wants to sexualize our children at age four
[55:51.680 --> 55:54.720]  It's like people get now the more you give them the more they want
[55:56.080 --> 56:01.440]  Right, that's what I'm saying draw a line in the sand whether that be the third trimester halfway through this pregnancy
[56:01.440 --> 56:05.680]  Whatever it may be and say, okay, this baby now except still the right
[56:06.240 --> 56:10.640]  So if a doctor or anybody molest or kills or does anything to that baby
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.920]  The existing laws that we have on the boat like murder manslaughter
[56:15.200 --> 56:17.200]  You're saying you're saying
[56:17.440 --> 56:22.000]  That it you declare third trimester. It's a human declare. It has human rights at that point
[56:23.840 --> 56:27.440]  I I hear what you're saying. God bless you. I appreciate your call. I mean
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.640]  I'll take any victory we can get and I get all the arguments for abortion. Believe me. I mean
[56:33.200 --> 56:37.920]  I've been Mr. abortion and I love the left always on national news shows. They've done a bunch of them
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.520]  Jones is a hypocrite. He's anti-abortion but admits he's had him
[56:41.520 --> 56:46.720]  That's like saying if I committed a murder and went to prison for 10 years and got out and and was reformed
[56:46.880 --> 56:50.800]  And I said murders wrong and they go, but you murdered somebody. You can't say murders wrong
[56:51.520 --> 56:55.520]  I have murdered my children. I was deluded. I didn't know what I was doing
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.440]  But I repent and I admit it and the left goes. Why would he tell his audience of pro-life people?
[56:59.440 --> 57:02.960]  He committed this act if he thinks it's bad because I'm not like you people
[57:03.440 --> 57:05.920]  On the left saying how you have the moral high ground. You're all perfect
[57:06.160 --> 57:08.960]  I want people that have had abortions to know they can be forgiven
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.000]  I want them to know that I'm not judging them. What matters is the heart
[57:12.640 --> 57:18.720]  God judges the heart and I want them to take the right choice and repent and be forgiven and have that weight lifted off of them
[57:19.120 --> 57:22.320]  That's why I tell the story not because it makes me look good. It makes me look bad
[57:22.320 --> 57:26.720]  But it's the truth and that's what God wants is just to admit what we've done
[57:27.520 --> 57:29.520]  Okay, it's that simple
[57:29.920 --> 57:33.840]  Best thing I ever did was admitting I killed my children and the whole world opened up to me after I did that

[59:03.120 --> 59:07.440]  50 different tax returns 50 different answers and almost all of them just
[59:07.440 --> 59:12.720]  Screw you over especially the big firms and and the big tax groups because they're part of the system
[59:12.720 --> 59:16.080]  And they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this show
[59:16.400 --> 59:20.800]  It's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody

[59:57.200 --> 1:00:03.760]  I'm saying and that's why they run the fake headline against myself
[1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:06.960]  And tucker carlson everywhere every day
[1:00:07.760 --> 1:00:09.760]  jones admits he's an actor
[1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:12.720]  Or tucker carlson says nobody would take me seriously
[1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:18.160]  Where do we say that we never said that they just say we said that
[1:00:19.280 --> 1:00:26.000]  But where's the clip? Where's the article? Where do we say that doesn't exist alex jones is playing a character?
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:33.760]  And is a performance artist jones is playing a character on his radio show the radio rants of alex jones
[1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:40.160]  Are jacked. He's actually a performance artist. He's a performance artist alex jones is a fake
[1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.800]  They're lying to you
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:46.160]  Because they think you're stupid and it's all based on
[1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:49.120]  custody battle max wife five years ago
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:54.000]  And she was trying to put into evidence of me dressed up more than a decade before like the joker
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:02.080]  He's sarcastic saying take your prozac kids. Take your illegal drugs too. You'll die. It's fun. So people wouldn't take drugs
[1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:06.560]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence. They look he's insane telling kids to use drugs
[1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:11.040]  And my lawyer went when jack nicholson plays the part of the joker
[1:01:11.520 --> 1:01:15.680]  No one thinks that's really jack nicholson. So yeah, when i've been cobra commander
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:19.520]  Or optimus prime on obonce
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:26.880]  Let's roll or the joker because i can do imitations of them all really good or darth vader. Don't act so surprised globalist
[1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.960]  You didn't think you could silence the american people, did you?
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:34.240]  Do I really think i'm barth vader? No
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:38.960]  Do I think i'm optimus prime over commander the joker? No and clearly
[1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.720]  No reasonable person would think when i'm doing satire
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:45.360]  That what i'm saying is what i really think
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:52.640]  No one believes the babelon b. It's not trying to lie to you. It's being sarcastic by the vaccinate me amodal today
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:56.160]  It's required by the cbc, but they play those games
[1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:01.600]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to even though I tell people okay. This is a joke
[1:02:01.680 --> 1:02:05.680]  This isn't serious. They clip it out and they say no
[1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:12.160]  This is what he really believes every day when I leave work. I do this that man's threatened this country
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:17.280]  And they go look he admitted in court. He's an actor. Well. Yeah. I was an actor in scander darkly
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:20.160]  I was an actor in waking life. I was an actor
[1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:22.720]  When I was cobra commander
[1:02:24.160 --> 1:02:29.600]  But it doesn't mean that alex jones the talk show host up here reading news articles to you
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.520]  Isn't a real thing and isn't something i'm actually saying and you know that
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:40.560]  You're insulted right now. I'm even explaining that to you and so am I but that's who these people are
[1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:44.800]  You don't know the power of the dark side
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:55.280]  Nick alex jones seems really talented. He's smart. He's funny as hell. It's truly funny. I'm kind of retarded
[1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:05.680]  Now that I've done those imitations
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:12.560]  Those little jokes. Do you now not listen to what I say about other things when I show you a powerful news article

[1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:22.480]  No, that's a real thing
[1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:27.520]  That's something happening in the real world. And that's what we're breaking down here today
[1:03:28.480 --> 1:03:30.480]  I am alex jones
[1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:38.480]  And I am the guy on this show every day. I am an american and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they

[1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:43.540]  I don't think so
[1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:52.220]  How do you get your abortion speed

[1:07:02.220 --> 1:07:04.220]  You piece of shit.
[1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:06.220]  Bunch of misogynists. Motherf***er.
[1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:08.220]  Take your male privilege somewhere else.
[1:07:08.220 --> 1:07:09.220]  Are you being aggressive?
[1:07:09.220 --> 1:07:10.220]  I'm being aggressive.

[1:07:11.220 --> 1:07:13.220]  Get him, Lars!
[1:07:13.220 --> 1:07:14.220]  Wow!
[1:07:14.220 --> 1:07:15.220]  Watch out.
[1:07:15.220 --> 1:07:19.220]  These stacks, the guys that attack outstrips.
[1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:25.220]  From the Frontlines of the Pro-Live War.
[1:07:25.220 --> 1:07:45.220]  From the Frontlines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:07:55.220 --> 1:08:15.220]  All this pain, all this suffering, all this screaming and crying on the left over there.
[1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.220]  Sacrament.
[1:08:16.220 --> 1:08:18.220]  The murder of unborn babies and now born babies.
[1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:21.220]  Potentially being taken away from them.
[1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:23.220]  We're taking your phone calls.
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:25.220]  We'll be quickly through your calls.
[1:08:25.220 --> 1:08:31.220]  Judge Joe Brown and others join us in the next hour to lay out how historic these events are and what they believe is coming next.
[1:08:31.220 --> 1:08:34.220]  But right now, let's continue in the order the calls are received.
[1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:37.220]  Hall in the great state of Michigan, you're on the air.
[1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:38.220]  Hey, Alex.
[1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:41.220]  We've taken the beach.
[1:08:41.220 --> 1:08:45.220]  This is the victory and now it's time to move on through the mainland.
[1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:50.220]  So you could pick this apart anyway, but it's raising awareness.
[1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:51.220]  It's raising awareness.
[1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:52.220]  You agree with me, right?
[1:08:52.220 --> 1:08:55.220]  I think the analogy of landing at Normandy is perfect.
[1:08:55.220 --> 1:08:56.220]  We're now on the beach.
[1:08:56.220 --> 1:08:58.220]  The real fight starts now.
[1:08:58.220 --> 1:08:59.220]  Thank you.
[1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:05.220]  Now, Alex, I have to tell you quickly, if I could indulge, you've inspired people in so many ways, including myself.
[1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:14.220]  And one of the things that you did is you said to pick a cause, to pick something to battle these globalists.
[1:09:14.220 --> 1:09:23.220]  And my cause, being in music over the last six or seven years, was to create a song that came to me directly from God.
[1:09:23.220 --> 1:09:27.220]  And this is how we're connected, Alex, spiritually.
[1:09:27.220 --> 1:09:28.220]  No, you're right.
[1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:32.220]  It is divine inspiration that is our secret weapon.
[1:09:32.220 --> 1:09:37.220]  I have a tattoo I'm looking at on my arm right now that says divine inspiration.
[1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:40.220]  How incredible, how synchronistic is that?
[1:09:40.220 --> 1:09:46.220]  Alex, this song came to me called Dear Mom, and I didn't know what it meant, but wrote it, created it.
[1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:50.220]  Listen, Alex, when we test this song, 15 seconds in.
[1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.220]  Well, say the name of the song again slowly.
[1:09:53.220 --> 1:09:56.220]  Okay, Dear Mom.
[1:09:56.220 --> 1:09:58.220]  Dear Mom, okay.
[1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:03.220]  This is, if you could find it, if you could put a link on it, it would be fantastic.
[1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:06.220]  Thousands of people have seen it, but this is how we're connected.
[1:10:06.220 --> 1:10:10.220]  When you interviewed John Henry Weston, I connected with him.
[1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:15.220]  And through Lifesight News, he invested in a motion picture type video that goes along.
[1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:16.220]  That's right.
[1:10:16.220 --> 1:10:21.220]  In fact, I want to get John Henry that heads up Lifesight News back on today or Sunday.
[1:10:21.220 --> 1:10:24.220]  We're trying to get him on right now to respond to all this.
[1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:25.220]  I'm sure he's very, very busy.
[1:10:25.220 --> 1:10:29.220]  But tell me where we find the song, because I get Dear Mom's name of the song.
[1:10:29.220 --> 1:10:30.220]  Where do we find it?
[1:10:30.220 --> 1:10:31.220]  Is that the headline?
[1:10:31.220 --> 1:10:32.220]  Where do I find it?
[1:10:32.220 --> 1:10:36.220]  Yes, just there's no profiteering.
[1:10:36.220 --> 1:10:37.220]  I don't care.
[1:10:37.220 --> 1:10:38.220]  Just where's the song?
[1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:39.220]  All right, YouTube.
[1:10:39.220 --> 1:10:41.220]  Just on the search bar.
[1:10:41.220 --> 1:10:44.220]  Can I give you my last name or would you rather not have to do that?
[1:10:44.220 --> 1:10:45.220]  Sir, go ahead.
[1:10:45.220 --> 1:10:46.220]  Just how do we, what I care about.
[1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:47.220]  Okay, Paul.
[1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:48.220]  Just hold on a second.
[1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:50.220]  When people call in, they try to give long URLs.
[1:10:50.220 --> 1:10:52.220]  They talk all day about their song.
[1:10:52.220 --> 1:10:54.220]  You need to say, here it is.
[1:10:54.220 --> 1:10:55.220]  It's important.
[1:10:55.220 --> 1:10:56.220]  I hope people share it.
[1:10:56.220 --> 1:10:58.220]  It was inspired by God.
[1:10:58.220 --> 1:11:00.220]  And then tell us where it's at in the name of it.
[1:11:00.220 --> 1:11:01.220]  So just tell me where it's at.
[1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:02.220]  It's on YouTube.
[1:11:02.220 --> 1:11:04.220]  The name is Dear Mom.
[1:11:04.220 --> 1:11:05.220]  Dear Mom.
[1:11:05.220 --> 1:11:06.220]  Put Paul Lubanski.
[1:11:06.220 --> 1:11:07.220]  L-U-B-A-N-S-K-I.
[1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:08.220]  Oh, brother.
[1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:09.220]  Love talking to you.
[1:11:09.220 --> 1:11:10.220]  Got to jump.
[1:11:10.220 --> 1:11:11.220]  Got to get to everybody else.
[1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:12.220]  Craig in Alabama.
[1:11:12.220 --> 1:11:13.220]  Craig, thank you.
[1:11:13.220 --> 1:11:14.220]  Go ahead.
[1:11:14.220 --> 1:11:15.220]  Hey, Alex.
[1:11:15.220 --> 1:11:16.220]  How are you doing?
[1:11:16.220 --> 1:11:17.220]  Good, brother.
[1:11:17.220 --> 1:11:18.220]  Go ahead.
[1:11:18.220 --> 1:11:19.220]  Yeah.
[1:11:19.220 --> 1:11:20.220]  I'll tell him I wrote this as well.
[1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:21.220]  I think it's a great thing.
[1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:22.220]  And it's going to be interesting.
[1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:23.220]  You're going to have the fiery peaceful protest going on this afternoon.
[1:11:23.220 --> 1:11:25.220]  That we could all look forward to.
[1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:27.220]  That's how they burn down half the country.
[1:11:27.220 --> 1:11:28.220]  It'll be mostly peaceful.
[1:11:28.220 --> 1:11:29.220]  Oh, yeah.
[1:11:29.220 --> 1:11:30.220]  Mostly peaceful.
[1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:31.220]  It's the troops in Pelosi's office.
[1:11:31.220 --> 1:11:34.220]  It's the end of the world worse than Pearl Harbor.
[1:11:34.220 --> 1:11:38.220]  Remember, Schumer and all of them said worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11.
[1:11:38.220 --> 1:11:43.220]  They're killing a couple of patriots and a cop having a heart attack three days later.
[1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:46.220]  They call that the biggest event in U.S. history.
[1:11:46.220 --> 1:11:48.220]  What gaslighting crap is that?
[1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:52.220]  It's almost as ridiculous as Biden blaming gas stations for gas prices.
[1:11:52.220 --> 1:11:53.220]  It's preposterous.
[1:11:53.220 --> 1:11:54.220]  It is.
[1:11:54.220 --> 1:11:56.220]  A lot of people believe it.
[1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:57.220]  Yeah.
[1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:00.220]  You know, the satanic temple is, you know, they, I think they fought a lawsuit saying it's
[1:12:00.220 --> 1:12:01.220]  against their worship ritual.
[1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:02.220]  So we get to look forward to that.
[1:12:02.220 --> 1:12:05.220]  No, they said it's their religious sacrament to kill babies.
[1:12:05.220 --> 1:12:06.220]  Right.
[1:12:06.220 --> 1:12:08.220]  So anybody against it must be with the Satanist.
[1:12:08.220 --> 1:12:11.220]  So we'll just see how it all rolls out.
[1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:12.220]  Absolutely.
[1:12:12.220 --> 1:12:15.220]  So what do you think is going to come out of this?
[1:12:15.220 --> 1:12:20.220]  I think there's a lot of riots and it's going to be back and forth, back and forth.
[1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:21.220]  I think it's over turning.
[1:12:21.220 --> 1:12:22.220]  It's a great thing.
[1:12:22.220 --> 1:12:25.220]  But you're going to have all their leftists come out and do their thing.
[1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:27.220]  Well, these demons are over their quarry.
[1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:29.220]  They're over the babies they want to murder.
[1:12:29.220 --> 1:12:35.220]  And they've got all these demonic women under a trance sitting there just, just, just hailing
[1:12:35.220 --> 1:12:38.220]  and howling and demanding more blood.
[1:12:38.220 --> 1:12:40.220]  So this is definitely bringing evil out in the open.
[1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:42.220]  Thank you so much for the call, Craig.
[1:12:42.220 --> 1:12:45.220]  Let's go ahead and talk to Beth in Wisconsin, then Thumper.
[1:12:45.220 --> 1:12:46.220]  Beth, thanks for holding.
[1:12:46.220 --> 1:12:47.220]  Go ahead.
[1:12:47.220 --> 1:12:54.220]  Well, Alex, I'm calling from the great state of Wisconsin because a darkness has lifted
[1:12:54.220 --> 1:12:55.220]  up.
[1:12:55.220 --> 1:13:00.220]  News outlets are reporting that within the last hour, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin
[1:13:00.220 --> 1:13:02.220]  has ceased all abortions.
[1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:03.220]  Wow.
[1:13:03.220 --> 1:13:10.220]  It's because of an 1849 law that's been on the books, but it was nullified by Roe v. Wade.
[1:13:10.220 --> 1:13:16.220]  But now that that's been overturned, it has gone back to being an abortion-free state.
[1:13:16.220 --> 1:13:17.220]  That's right.
[1:13:17.220 --> 1:13:19.100]  And God cares about the heart.
[1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:21.220]  It doesn't matter that we haven't totally stopped it yet.
[1:13:21.220 --> 1:13:22.220]  We're trying.
[1:13:22.220 --> 1:13:24.220]  And God will take us the rest of the way.
[1:13:24.220 --> 1:13:26.220]  I've seen this in my life thousands of times.
[1:13:26.220 --> 1:13:29.220]  Do the right thing, fight hard, and God will take us the rest of the way.
[1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:30.220]  And you're right.
[1:13:30.220 --> 1:13:32.220]  This is a big victory and God's watching.
[1:13:32.220 --> 1:13:33.220]  Amen, Alex.
[1:13:33.220 --> 1:13:34.220]  And one more thing.
[1:13:34.220 --> 1:13:37.220]  I just wanted you to know that I do pray for you.
[1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:43.220]  And like a year and a half ago, I was praying because now I know occasionally you go on
[1:13:43.220 --> 1:13:48.220]  one of these rants and I just asked the Lord, like, should I be listening to this?
[1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:50.220]  I mean, I'm a really conservative lady.
[1:13:50.220 --> 1:13:53.220]  I go to Sunday school and, you know, should I be listening to that?
[1:13:53.220 --> 1:14:00.220]  And so I asked the Lord and he said, Beth, not everybody is a 50-plus-year-old Sunday
[1:14:00.220 --> 1:14:03.220]  school teacher that I need warriors.
[1:14:03.220 --> 1:14:05.220]  And Alex is a warrior.
[1:14:05.220 --> 1:14:09.220]  And he said, nobody fights for Alex.
[1:14:09.220 --> 1:14:11.220]  Nobody fights for the babies.
[1:14:11.220 --> 1:14:15.220]  Nobody fights for my children like Alex.
[1:14:15.220 --> 1:14:19.220]  So I continue to pray for you, support you.
[1:14:19.220 --> 1:14:21.220]  I just wanted you to know that.
[1:14:21.220 --> 1:14:23.220]  Well, you bring tears to my eyes.
[1:14:23.220 --> 1:14:24.220]  I only know this, Beth.
[1:14:24.220 --> 1:14:25.220]  I'm a real person.
[1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:26.220]  I don't put on acts.
[1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:28.220]  And I am a fallen, evil person.
[1:14:28.220 --> 1:14:29.220]  I love God.
[1:14:29.220 --> 1:14:30.220]  My heart's right.
[1:14:30.220 --> 1:14:34.220]  But I haven't, like, you know, had my best friend killed so I could have his wife like
[1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:35.220]  King David did.
[1:14:35.220 --> 1:14:36.220]  And he repented.
[1:14:36.220 --> 1:14:39.220]  But I am a savage killer.
[1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:41.220]  I am a wild man.
[1:14:41.220 --> 1:14:45.220]  And I get out of control, especially when I do nighttime shows and I'm exhausted.
[1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:46.220]  And then later I see it.
[1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:47.220]  I think it's horrible and it's terrible.
[1:14:47.220 --> 1:14:51.220]  But it's real and I'm influenced by the flesh, everything else, but you're right.
[1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:53.220]  I love God and I'm trying as hard as I can.
[1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:55.220]  So just forgive me when I get out of control.
[1:14:55.220 --> 1:15:01.220]  Believe me, I pray every morning that I will not be a jerk to my family, that I will not
[1:15:01.220 --> 1:15:05.220]  be a jerk to my crew, that I will not beat the hell out of somebody that gets in my face
[1:15:05.220 --> 1:15:06.220]  on the street.
[1:15:06.220 --> 1:15:09.220]  And so just keep praying that I'll be given peace and I appreciate you.
[1:15:09.220 --> 1:15:10.220]  God bless you.
[1:15:10.220 --> 1:15:14.220]  All right, we got to go to break, but it's totally true, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:15.220]  You study history.
[1:15:15.220 --> 1:15:17.220]  You study the Bible.
[1:15:17.220 --> 1:15:20.220]  God normally, Christ was different because that was God's son.
[1:15:20.220 --> 1:15:25.220]  God raises up people that are John the Baptist, Moses.
[1:15:25.220 --> 1:15:29.220]  I'm not going to compare myself to that, but these people were killers.
[1:15:29.220 --> 1:15:33.220]  And the point is God is not looking for wimps to be the tip of the spear.
[1:15:33.220 --> 1:15:37.220]  And I'm not claiming that I've got all the answers around perfect, but I'm telling you,
[1:15:37.220 --> 1:15:40.220]  ladies and gentlemen, I have felt the power of the spiritual world.
[1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:44.220]  I have had the power of Satan and then I was able to reject it before it took me over.
[1:15:44.220 --> 1:15:46.220]  And I've had the power of God.
[1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:47.220]  I've experienced both.
[1:15:47.220 --> 1:15:49.220]  And so I've almost pushed Satan out of my life 95%.
[1:15:49.220 --> 1:15:51.220]  That 5% is bad though.
[1:15:51.220 --> 1:15:55.220]  I got a big old satanic streak right down my back, folks.
[1:15:55.220 --> 1:15:56.220]  And so do you.
[1:15:56.220 --> 1:16:25.220]  We'll be right back.
[1:16:26.220 --> 1:16:30.220]  The immune support formula is incredible by itself.
[1:16:30.220 --> 1:16:32.220]  These other three together, it is amazing.
[1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:33.220]  60% off.
[1:16:33.220 --> 1:16:39.220]  Then the Trafecta immune support, 50% off on immune support X2 and D3 gummies.
[1:16:39.220 --> 1:16:44.220]  And then 40% off on X2 now back in stock at infowarstore.com.
[1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:48.220]  Now, just the X2 alone is the missing link with most people.
[1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:53.220]  Highest quality deep breath crystal iodine beyond critical for immune system in your whole body.
[1:16:53.220 --> 1:16:58.220]  It's 40% off back in stock, but get four of the products together for 60% off.
[1:16:58.220 --> 1:17:05.220]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[1:17:05.220 --> 1:17:09.220]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[1:17:09.220 --> 1:17:13.220]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[1:17:13.220 --> 1:17:16.220]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[1:17:16.220 --> 1:17:24.220]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[1:17:24.220 --> 1:17:29.220]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[1:17:29.220 --> 1:17:36.220]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:41.220]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming.
[1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:47.220]  But you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:52.220]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[1:18:58.220 --> 1:19:02.220]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[1:19:02.220 --> 1:19:06.220]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[1:19:06.220 --> 1:19:11.220]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition,
[1:19:11.220 --> 1:19:15.220]  buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[1:19:15.220 --> 1:19:21.220]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[1:19:21.220 --> 1:19:25.220]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque,
[1:19:25.220 --> 1:19:31.220]  and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[1:19:31.220 --> 1:19:38.220]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[1:19:38.220 --> 1:19:43.220]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:19:43.220 --> 1:19:48.220]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion
[1:19:48.220 --> 1:19:52.220]  about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[1:19:52.220 --> 1:20:16.220]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:32.220]  We will come back up for air.
[1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:38.220]  It is June 24th, 2022, the day we hit bottom.
[1:20:38.220 --> 1:20:41.220]  I think you can say it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:41.220 --> 1:20:43.220]  We're coming back up now.
[1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:47.220]  It's gonna be hard, it's gonna be painful, but in the end, we're gonna stand for unborn,
[1:20:47.220 --> 1:20:50.220]  we're gonna stand for old people, we're gonna stand for our poor people.
[1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:52.220]  We're gonna build prosperity, we're gonna build a godly system,
[1:20:52.220 --> 1:20:56.220]  we're gonna defeat the market of beast, but we're gonna go through hell first.
[1:20:56.220 --> 1:20:59.220]  Let's continue with your phone calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:01.220]  Let's talk to Thumper in Michigan.
[1:21:01.220 --> 1:21:03.220]  Thumper, thanks for calling. Go ahead.
[1:21:03.220 --> 1:21:07.220]  Yeah, I was calling in just, I'm gonna take an opposite side.
[1:21:07.220 --> 1:21:11.220]  I'm gonna say this was done on purpose to turn the women out like hornets
[1:21:11.220 --> 1:21:16.220]  for the next vote to try to keep power of the house.
[1:21:16.220 --> 1:21:21.220]  I think California is corporate owned, UN owned,
[1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:25.220]  and that what they're gonna do is make abortions free.
[1:21:25.220 --> 1:21:28.220]  They'll fly the women out, plus they can stall the pregnant women
[1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:32.220]  so they can get older fetuses, fly them out to California,
[1:21:32.220 --> 1:21:37.220]  and they already have the women's clinic set up with the anchor baby thing,
[1:21:37.220 --> 1:21:43.220]  and they'll fly them out there, and then they can make a streamline or pipeline
[1:21:43.220 --> 1:21:47.220]  directly for organ donations from the older fetuses.
[1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:50.220]  You are completely correct that that is their plan B,
[1:21:50.220 --> 1:21:54.220]  but they did not want the Supreme Court to say this and hand it back to the states,
[1:21:54.220 --> 1:21:58.220]  but you're right, they're gonna continue to try to change up the paradigm.
[1:21:58.220 --> 1:22:00.220]  But what was the Supreme Court supposed to do then?
[1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:03.220]  Not overturn Roe v. Wade?
[1:22:03.220 --> 1:22:07.220]  I mean, obviously it was weighted, I'm not saying all the justices were part of it,
[1:22:07.220 --> 1:22:09.220]  but obviously they waited until now.
[1:22:09.220 --> 1:22:14.220]  When it came out last year, they had the votes, and Chief Justice Roberts blocked it.
[1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:18.220]  So I think, I don't think we know that you're right, you're absolutely right, Thumper,
[1:22:18.220 --> 1:22:23.220]  that they waited and he controlled this and held it up as long as he could for the election.
[1:22:23.220 --> 1:22:27.220]  You're right, but that's them trying to make lemonade out of lemons.
[1:22:27.220 --> 1:22:31.220]  Right, but what they're going to do is vilify the right and say,
[1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:33.220]  oh, it's all these religions together.
[1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:38.220]  Remember, the UN wants one world religion.
[1:22:38.220 --> 1:22:39.220]  I hear you.
[1:22:39.220 --> 1:22:42.220]  So what I'm saying is the hearts are convicted of the people.
[1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:45.220]  Young people are almost 80% anti-abortion now.
[1:22:45.220 --> 1:22:47.220]  We're winning hearts and minds, and that's what matters.
[1:22:47.220 --> 1:22:51.220]  We reach enough people to not be part of this and realize it's a life they're killing.
[1:22:51.220 --> 1:22:53.220]  It won't matter how many Planned Parenthoods they've got.
[1:22:53.220 --> 1:22:54.220]  People won't kill their children.
[1:22:54.220 --> 1:22:55.220]  Does that make sense?
[1:22:55.220 --> 1:23:00.220]  Yes, but what I want you to do is keep hammering that they're playing women for fools
[1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:04.220]  and that women, you know, they're emotional, but they're not singing with the UN.
[1:23:04.220 --> 1:23:09.220]  You're going to give up property rights, you know, your birthright, everything.
[1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:10.220]  That's right.
[1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:12.220]  Oh, you've got a right to kill your kid, but you have a right to nothing else.
[1:23:12.220 --> 1:23:13.220]  You'll owe nothing.
[1:23:13.220 --> 1:23:14.220]  You'll have nothing.
[1:23:14.220 --> 1:23:15.220]  You'll eat bugs.
[1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:16.220]  Yes.
[1:23:16.220 --> 1:23:17.220]  The way of the new world order is death and destruction.
[1:23:17.220 --> 1:23:19.220]  Thank you so much, Thumper.
[1:23:19.220 --> 1:23:21.220]  All right, up next, Josh in FEMA Region 3.
[1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:23.220]  You're on the year worldwide.
[1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:26.220]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[1:23:26.220 --> 1:23:27.220]  Yes, sir.
[1:23:27.220 --> 1:23:30.220]  Real quick, I just want to plug X2.
[1:23:30.220 --> 1:23:32.220]  Man, I've been taking it for the last month and a half.
[1:23:32.220 --> 1:23:34.220]  It's made amazing changes.
[1:23:34.220 --> 1:23:36.220]  I started dreaming again.
[1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:38.220]  It's just, it's amazing.
[1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:43.220]  But let's spend a little bit more time on that because most people are iodine deficient.
[1:23:43.220 --> 1:23:47.220]  Even the UN admits two plus billion have cognitive disabilities and health problems
[1:23:47.220 --> 1:23:48.220]  from lack of iodine.
[1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:52.220]  Most iodine is not in the soil or it's bound to other elements, so it's not absorbable.
[1:23:52.220 --> 1:23:56.220]  This is pure medical grade iodine, the highest quality anywhere.
[1:23:56.220 --> 1:24:00.220]  X2, unbelievable for your immune system, your libido, your body.
[1:24:00.220 --> 1:24:02.220]  It is critical to life.
[1:24:02.220 --> 1:24:03.220]  X2 is incredible.
[1:24:03.220 --> 1:24:05.220]  You're saying you're dreaming again.
[1:24:05.220 --> 1:24:07.220]  What else has happened with X2?
[1:24:07.220 --> 1:24:10.220]  It's just, I just feel better.
[1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:12.220]  Like it's hard to explain.
[1:24:12.220 --> 1:24:14.220]  I feel like I'm more hydrated.
[1:24:14.220 --> 1:24:15.220]  I'm a roofer.
[1:24:15.220 --> 1:24:19.220]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:21.220]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:23.220]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[1:24:23.220 --> 1:24:26.220]  I haven't had a dream in 15 years.
[1:24:26.220 --> 1:24:29.220]  And two weeks after taking it, I was starting to dream.
[1:24:29.220 --> 1:24:31.220]  I was starting to dream every single night.
[1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:33.220]  Well, this isn't some new age thing.
[1:24:33.220 --> 1:24:35.220]  They just piggyback on it.
[1:24:35.220 --> 1:24:39.220]  The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride, and that's the third eye.
[1:24:39.220 --> 1:24:43.220]  Literally, it's connected to higher dreaming, higher consciousness, medically.
[1:24:43.220 --> 1:24:47.220]  And then obviously the ancients said connected to spiritual connection.
[1:24:47.220 --> 1:24:51.220]  And when it gets filled with fluoride and bromide and bromine, all the bad halogens,
[1:24:51.220 --> 1:24:53.220]  then people don't dream.
[1:24:53.220 --> 1:24:56.220]  And they don't have higher consciousness statistically.
[1:24:56.220 --> 1:25:00.220]  But real iodine goes through and just burns all that out.
[1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:02.220]  It doesn't just get in there.
[1:25:02.220 --> 1:25:05.220]  It removes the bad stuff in the major studies.
[1:25:05.220 --> 1:25:07.220]  That's why everybody should get X2.
[1:25:07.220 --> 1:25:10.220]  We have a limited supply of it at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:10.220 --> 1:25:14.220]  It is, ladies and gentlemen, 40% off right now, though it's about to sell out.
[1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:16.220]  Get your X2 at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:18.220]  It's about 15 days to kick in.
[1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:20.220]  infowarstore.com X2.
[1:25:20.220 --> 1:25:23.220]  What else do you want to say about abortion, sir?
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:27.220]  Just that this is a small victory in a major war,
[1:25:27.220 --> 1:25:31.220]  that now we have to turn our focus to the states
[1:25:31.220 --> 1:25:35.220]  and start putting representatives in place to continue this battle
[1:25:35.220 --> 1:25:41.220]  and not just celebrate because it's really time to double down.
[1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:43.220]  I totally agree and God bless you.
[1:25:43.220 --> 1:25:45.220]  I am completely doubled down.
[1:25:45.220 --> 1:25:49.220]  I mean, all their persecution, all their attacks has just made us stronger.
[1:25:49.220 --> 1:25:52.220]  If they had done all this stuff to me, I would have been complacent.
[1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:56.220]  But the fact that they have assaulted me and my family and lied about us
[1:25:56.220 --> 1:25:59.220]  and tried to destroy us and done things I won't mention on air
[1:25:59.220 --> 1:26:01.220]  that are just so horrible because it gives them pleasure.
[1:26:01.220 --> 1:26:03.220]  I'm not going to talk about it.
[1:26:03.220 --> 1:26:06.220]  That persecution is a sign of we're over the target.
[1:26:06.220 --> 1:26:09.220]  All right, up next here. Who's been holding the longest now?
[1:26:09.220 --> 1:26:11.220]  Pretty good job taking calls, aren't we?
[1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:13.220]  Tanner in the great state of Texas.
[1:26:13.220 --> 1:26:16.220]  Tanner, you're on the air. Welcome.
[1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:18.220]  Man, y'all are doing really good on calls today.
[1:26:18.220 --> 1:26:23.220]  Look, whether the Roe vs. Wade decision was organic or orchestrated,
[1:26:23.220 --> 1:26:26.220]  it provides people a choice.
[1:26:26.220 --> 1:26:28.220]  Serve evil or serve God.
[1:26:28.220 --> 1:26:30.220]  It gets us back on track.
[1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:31.220]  Exactly, y'all.
[1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:34.220]  I'm going to say it once more. Thank God you called, Tanner.
[1:26:34.220 --> 1:26:36.220]  I want you to continue. I'm going to interrupt you more.
[1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:38.220]  But God says you're either hot or cold.
[1:26:38.220 --> 1:26:40.220]  Do not be lukewarm. I'll spit you out of my mouth.
[1:26:40.220 --> 1:26:45.220]  It makes it a very clear demarcation line and gets the war out in the open.
[1:26:45.220 --> 1:26:47.220]  This is a good thing.
[1:26:47.220 --> 1:26:49.220]  That's exactly right. So you have a choice.
[1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:51.220]  Serve evil or serve life.
[1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:54.220]  It's not over. This war is not over. It is just beginning.
[1:26:54.220 --> 1:26:56.220]  So everyone's got to double down.
[1:26:56.220 --> 1:26:58.220]  This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.
[1:26:58.220 --> 1:27:01.220]  They're going to take the economy. They're going to do everything else.
[1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:05.220]  Second part of this, look, the Supreme Court decision is great.
[1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:07.220]  I am a convicted felon.
[1:27:07.220 --> 1:27:11.220]  A nonviolent, nonfirearm, non-drug-related crime.
[1:27:11.220 --> 1:27:15.220]  And I am forced to not be able to defend my life.
[1:27:15.220 --> 1:27:19.220]  So my life has no value according to the United States government now.
[1:27:19.220 --> 1:27:22.220]  I'm a former first responder of six years.
[1:27:22.220 --> 1:27:24.220]  And I lost everything.
[1:27:24.220 --> 1:27:29.220]  But I'm still trying to hold strong in the way God wants me to be.
[1:27:29.220 --> 1:27:33.220]  And I recognize the crime that I committed was wrong,
[1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:35.220]  but I didn't know what I was doing.
[1:27:35.220 --> 1:27:37.220]  It is a long story. I didn't know what I was doing.
[1:27:37.220 --> 1:27:39.220]  I pissed the ATF off.
[1:27:39.220 --> 1:27:40.220]  And here we are.
[1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:41.220]  So I'm telling everybody.
[1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:45.220]  Oh, there's the millions of innocent people because they're unconstitutional.
[1:27:45.220 --> 1:27:48.220]  You shouldn't say you admit you were wrong.
[1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:51.220]  If you didn't commit a violent act with a gun and they got you on some fake gun law,
[1:27:51.220 --> 1:27:53.220]  you didn't know it was there.
[1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:59.220]  It's like saying in 1850, the Supreme Court said black people weren't human.
[1:27:59.220 --> 1:28:03.220]  And some blacks stood up and said, I am a human. I got rights.
[1:28:03.220 --> 1:28:06.220]  The black person was right, not the Supreme Court.
[1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:10.220]  And so it doesn't matter if the system says you're bad because you had a gun.
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:15.220]  You weren't doing it. It's a victimless crime. It's BS, brother.
[1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:18.220]  I'll humble myself before God and I will tell everyone this.
[1:28:18.220 --> 1:28:20.220]  Get ready.
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:25.220]  They will come for you because you are righteous and you stand on the right side of God.
[1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:26.220]  Everyone better get ready.
[1:28:26.220 --> 1:28:28.220]  That's right. Everybody should get ready.
[1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:31.220]  That's the theme of this broadcast. Thank you, Tanner.
[1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:33.220]  All right. Here's the deal.
[1:28:33.220 --> 1:28:36.220]  We got loaded phone lines and I will intend to get everybody.
[1:28:36.220 --> 1:28:41.220]  Judge Joe Brown's coming up in 30 minutes, but we have a very special guest who broke
[1:28:41.220 --> 1:28:49.220]  the story about Andrew Gillum and the drug-fueled gay orgies.
[1:28:49.220 --> 1:28:51.220]  And we're not attacking him because he's gay.
[1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:54.220]  We're attacking him because he was compromised and blackmailed.
[1:28:54.220 --> 1:28:56.220]  And now this has come out.
[1:28:56.220 --> 1:28:59.220]  Imagine having him instead of the Santas.
[1:28:59.220 --> 1:29:04.220]  There's an old Beto one saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like this.
[1:29:04.220 --> 1:29:07.220]  Imagine God would tie up your camel.
[1:29:07.220 --> 1:29:09.220]  Hunter S. Thompson put it this way.
[1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.220]  Pray to God, but row away from the rocks.
[1:29:11.220 --> 1:29:15.220]  If your boat is going towards the rocks, pray to God that you don't get smashed on him
[1:29:15.220 --> 1:29:17.220]  and killed, but also try to row away.
[1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:19.220]  You can't just sit there like a jellyfish.
[1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:21.220]  And it's the same thing with our immune system.
[1:29:21.220 --> 1:29:23.220]  God helps those who help themselves.
[1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:27.220]  We have a lot of amazing products on sale right now at infowarstore.com.

[1:30:27.220 --> 1:30:29.220]  The Bilderberg Group founded Davos Group.
[1:30:29.220 --> 1:30:32.220]  So now the fight's out in the open.
[1:30:32.220 --> 1:30:36.220]  They're making their move because they know they're behind schedule.
[1:30:36.220 --> 1:30:37.220]  We're going to win this thing.
[1:30:37.220 --> 1:30:38.220]  God's watching.
[1:30:38.220 --> 1:30:39.220]  The children are counting on us.
[1:30:39.220 --> 1:30:42.220]  I just want to thank the viewers and listeners for your word of mouth
[1:30:42.220 --> 1:30:44.220]  and your prayer and your financial support because without you,
[1:30:44.220 --> 1:30:46.220]  info wars would not be here.
[1:30:46.220 --> 1:30:50.220]  I want you to really internalize the fact that you are the info war
[1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:52.220]  and you are the reason humanity has a fighting chance.
[1:30:52.220 --> 1:30:55.220]  So I want to thank you and salute you again for all you've done
[1:30:55.220 --> 1:31:24.220]  and ask you now to redouble your efforts.
[1:31:25.220 --> 1:31:32.220]  So here is the thing,
[1:31:32.220 --> 1:31:35.220]  the question is,
[1:31:35.220 --> 1:31:37.220]  what will happen if we have the best deals
[1:31:37.220 --> 1:31:42.220]  and high quality food and a whole spectrum of preparedness

[1:32:51.220 --> 1:33:18.220]  You thought the lead in winter would bring you down forever
[1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:23.220]  but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[1:33:23.220 --> 1:33:32.220]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas. You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:32.220 --> 1:34:01.220]  You see this turn out here?
[1:34:01.220 --> 1:34:10.220]  You ain't seen nothing yet. Women are going to control their bodies no matter how they try to stop us.
[1:34:10.220 --> 1:34:16.220]  They held with the Supreme Court. We will defy them. Women will be in control of their bodies
[1:34:16.220 --> 1:34:23.220]  and if they think black women are intimidated or afraid, they got another thought coming.
[1:34:23.220 --> 1:34:29.220]  Black women will be out in droves. We will be out by the thousands. We will be out by the millions.
[1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:35.220]  We are going to make sure we fight by the right to control our own bodies.
[1:34:35.220 --> 1:34:42.220]  Thank you. Hello everybody. Hello young girls. We are fighting for you.
[1:34:42.220 --> 1:35:00.220]  We are fighting for you. We are fighting for you.
[1:35:00.220 --> 1:35:16.220]  All right. Jacob Ingalls has been highly persecuted and banned in the platform when in the middle
[1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:21.220]  of the big DeSantis fight to become governor a few years ago.
[1:35:21.220 --> 1:35:26.220]  Imagine we didn't have DeSantis as a governor to show us how great he was.
[1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:34.220]  He was critical in exposing what was really going on with the Florida gubernatorial candidate
[1:35:34.220 --> 1:35:39.220]  who almost won by fraud, Andrew Gillum, who has now been hit with a federal indictment.
[1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:41.220]  Jacob Ingalls, we really appreciate you joining us.
[1:35:41.220 --> 1:35:48.220]  I had to judge Joe Brown next hour to talk about this because it's not just old news.
[1:35:48.220 --> 1:35:55.220]  This shows what the Democrats with Avenatti or any other minions do when they fail, they destroy him.
[1:35:55.220 --> 1:35:59.220]  He's now indicted. Why is he indicted? I want to talk about the bigger picture of DeSantis
[1:35:59.220 --> 1:36:03.220]  who is coming out against the vaccines, coming out against the great reset.
[1:36:03.220 --> 1:36:06.220]  I like Trump a lot. I wish he was more like DeSantis.
[1:36:06.220 --> 1:36:08.220]  You're right there in Florida in the middle of this.
[1:36:08.220 --> 1:36:13.220]  You've been massively persecuted. I will spend 30 minutes on how you help push it, how you help break it,
[1:36:13.220 --> 1:36:20.220]  how you were the guys that first put it out, the hotel room, the gay-fueled orgy,
[1:36:20.220 --> 1:36:24.220]  and the guys he was with obviously looks like blackmailing him taking photos and video of this.
[1:36:24.220 --> 1:36:28.220]  You broke all that. They tried to deny it. They persecuted you, but later it was true.
[1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:34.220]  Again, we're not attacking this guy because of what he's doing with adults in a hotel room.
[1:36:34.220 --> 1:36:39.220]  The issue is he's compromised and now they didn't get their compromised operative in.
[1:36:39.220 --> 1:36:45.220]  Now they've got a burning. The question is what did he know and what is Andrew Gillum covering up
[1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:50.220]  or why are they indicting him? They don't indict criminals like Joe Biden's son, Hunter,
[1:36:50.220 --> 1:36:54.220]  when you're working with the system. So why are they turning on their own minion?
[1:36:54.220 --> 1:36:58.220]  Jacob Engels, CentralFord of Post.com, give us your expert analysis on this.
[1:36:58.220 --> 1:37:03.220]  Congratulations on helping get DeSantis elected a month before the election and exposing this
[1:37:03.220 --> 1:37:08.220]  because DeSantis barely won because of election fraud. We know that.
[1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:11.220]  If it wasn't for your report, I think there's a good chance that DeSantis wouldn't have gotten in.
[1:37:11.220 --> 1:37:14.220]  So kudos to you.
[1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:16.220]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for having me on.
[1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:24.220]  And, you know, I remember in 2018 when we had the recount and we were down there in Broward County
[1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:28.220]  and every single vote truck that was coming in, seals were broken on the back.
[1:37:28.220 --> 1:37:34.220]  It really was a primer for what they did in 2020 and 2018 in Florida with the gubernatorial election.
[1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:42.220]  And early on in 2017, Alex, late 2017, early 2018, I reported that Andrew Gillum was having
[1:37:42.220 --> 1:37:48.220]  gay drug-fueled orgies. I reported that he was involved with these lobbyists
[1:37:48.220 --> 1:37:51.220]  when he was mayor of Tallahassee, getting them sweetheart deals.
[1:37:51.220 --> 1:37:56.220]  And when you look at the indictment that came out yesterday, 19 counts of wire fraud
[1:37:56.220 --> 1:38:02.220]  and then lying to the FBI, some of the key players involved in that remain unnamed
[1:38:02.220 --> 1:38:06.220]  but you can tell by the transactions and the monies that went through
[1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:08.220]  are the same exact people I was talking about.
[1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:12.220]  And they said, Jake, you can't talk about his sexuality. It doesn't matter.
[1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:16.220]  And I said, no, it's not about his sexuality. It's about being compromised.
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:19.220]  Because if he got elected governor and he was doing this kind of stuff
[1:38:19.220 --> 1:38:23.220]  that he was doing in his private life, now three years later when we exposed him
[1:38:23.220 --> 1:38:27.220]  in the hotel room, passed out, covered in vomit after the orgy,
[1:38:27.220 --> 1:38:31.220]  what would have happened in our state, Alex? What would have happened in Florida?
[1:38:31.220 --> 1:38:33.220]  What kind of crooked developer? What kind of crooked globalist?
[1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:39.220]  What kind of crooked source scheme was going to be pushed through because they had the goods on him?
[1:38:39.220 --> 1:38:42.220]  Well, that's right. In a few minutes we'll show some of those images.
[1:38:42.220 --> 1:38:45.220]  Viewer discretion advised. We're not going to show any of the pornographic ones.
[1:38:45.220 --> 1:38:49.220]  But him covered vomit, laying on the ground in the hotel room, the methamphetamine.
[1:38:49.220 --> 1:38:54.220]  This was a compromised individual. And what a message to the system
[1:38:54.220 --> 1:38:58.220]  that if you serve this, they will destroy you.
[1:38:58.220 --> 1:39:02.220]  Yeah. And we have to wonder. He recently started a podcast.
[1:39:02.220 --> 1:39:07.220]  He was kind of going out on his own. He wasn't doing the cable news circuit anymore.
[1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:11.220]  He went to rehab. He came out as bisexual. His wife supported him.
[1:39:11.220 --> 1:39:17.220]  He had a big article in GQ last February to help rehabilitate his image.
[1:39:17.220 --> 1:39:20.220]  So they tried to prop all this up.
[1:39:20.220 --> 1:39:25.220]  Yeah. No, no. Even after what he did, even after him being caught in that hotel room,
[1:39:25.220 --> 1:39:31.220]  cheating on his wife, with the male prostitute, with the drugs, with the defibrillator machine,
[1:39:31.220 --> 1:39:37.220]  with the meth, with the coke, with all of that, they still let him clean himself up,
[1:39:37.220 --> 1:39:39.220]  trying to push him back into the spotlight.
[1:39:39.220 --> 1:39:46.220]  And before he had his incident in March of 2021, Alex, in 2020, he went up to D.C.
[1:39:46.220 --> 1:39:50.220]  for a secret meeting with Obama that was then leaked to Politico,
[1:39:50.220 --> 1:39:54.220]  where they were talking about how he was a potential 2020 presidential candidate.
[1:39:54.220 --> 1:39:59.220]  And that's the question. Was he part of Obama's $56,000 in hot dogs operation?
[1:39:59.220 --> 1:40:02.220]  Is this guy Obama's lover?
[1:40:02.220 --> 1:40:07.220]  You know, a lot of people have been discussing that since the news broke last year,
[1:40:07.220 --> 1:40:09.220]  and they were certainly very close.
[1:40:09.220 --> 1:40:13.220]  Obama bent over backwards to come out and support Gillum,
[1:40:13.220 --> 1:40:15.220]  rallying all over the state of Florida.
[1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:18.220]  And he really closed the gap for Gillum in those final weeks.
[1:40:18.220 --> 1:40:25.220]  And so nothing would surprise me, especially considering how Mayor Gillum was operating.
[1:40:25.220 --> 1:40:29.220]  How do we know about these people taking photos of him with the defibrillator,
[1:40:29.220 --> 1:40:31.220]  meaning he was taking so many drugs, he wanted his heart restarted.
[1:40:31.220 --> 1:40:34.220]  This is extreme dangerous behavior.
[1:40:34.220 --> 1:40:40.220]  Was this deep state operatives speculating that we're trying to get full control of him?
[1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:43.220]  Because who would do this?
[1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:47.220]  I think, Alex, they saw him as a future political commodity,
[1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:50.220]  but they saw him as a little bit of a free spirit.
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:54.220]  So I think what happened there, he hires the male escort,
[1:40:54.220 --> 1:40:56.220]  a couple of other people are in the room,
[1:40:56.220 --> 1:40:58.220]  and they're doing these really extreme things.
[1:40:58.220 --> 1:41:03.220]  And remember in the police report, they didn't release the police body cam footage,
[1:41:03.220 --> 1:41:06.220]  but in the police report, when the police entered the room,
[1:41:06.220 --> 1:41:09.220]  he was so incoherent, he could barely stand,
[1:41:09.220 --> 1:41:13.220]  he was falling over, he couldn't speak, he couldn't even give a statement.
[1:41:13.220 --> 1:41:18.220]  So I think something is afoot there where maybe he went off the leash a little bit,
[1:41:18.220 --> 1:41:19.220]  and they had to pull it back in.
[1:41:19.220 --> 1:41:21.220]  Well, I mean, they may have forced drugged him, too.
[1:41:21.220 --> 1:41:25.220]  He may be the victim, I mean, this looks really bad.
[1:41:25.220 --> 1:41:28.220]  Yeah, and that's a potential thing, too,
[1:41:28.220 --> 1:41:30.220]  because just seeing that defibrillator...
[1:41:30.220 --> 1:41:33.220]  You can get back to the defibrillator, exactly.
[1:41:33.220 --> 1:41:35.220]  This is how they compromise people.
[1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:36.220]  Talk about the defibrillator.
[1:41:36.220 --> 1:41:39.220]  For folks that don't know who that is, that's the paddles they use to restart your heart.
[1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:41.220]  Who the hell has that?
[1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:45.220]  Well, interestingly enough, the male escort that was with Gillum
[1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:50.220]  happened to be a emergency room nurse who brought his old kit with him.
[1:41:50.220 --> 1:41:54.220]  So very powerful drugs that are not on the street.
[1:41:54.220 --> 1:41:56.220]  So they were, it looks to me speculatively,
[1:41:56.220 --> 1:41:59.220]  like they were really getting ready to drug him out of his mind to compromise him.
[1:41:59.220 --> 1:42:01.220]  And in case that happened, they had a defibrillator there.
[1:42:01.220 --> 1:42:07.220]  Who should be indicted, in my view, is the people that brought the defibrillators and all these drugs.
[1:42:07.220 --> 1:42:10.220]  Well, Ann, let's get even more into this.
[1:42:10.220 --> 1:42:12.220]  Why hasn't the body cam footage been released
[1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:15.220]  where we would see the faces of the other men in the room?
[1:42:15.220 --> 1:42:19.220]  We know there was the male prostitute, but we don't know the other two individuals in the room.
[1:42:19.220 --> 1:42:22.220]  Why is that? Why can't that footage be released?
[1:42:22.220 --> 1:42:25.220]  That's right. So people get into politics, the dirty side of it,
[1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:28.220]  particularly Democrats, Republicans too, and they trust it.
[1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:32.220]  They just do it because they know, well, you'll trust me if I do this, then they set you up.
[1:42:32.220 --> 1:42:35.220]  We're going to talk about this with Jacob Engels, CentralFloridaPost.com,
[1:42:35.220 --> 1:42:37.220]  and where he sees all this going.
[1:42:37.220 --> 1:42:44.220]  But this is the real underbelly of how they compromise people very, very early on and then control them.
[1:42:44.220 --> 1:42:48.220]  So why are they inditing him now? What is the point of that?
[1:42:48.220 --> 1:42:49.220]  This is a really important story.
[1:42:49.220 --> 1:42:55.220]  Then Judge Joe Brown joins us, your phone calls and more on this important, this historic Friday edition.

[1:44:05.220 --> 1:44:06.220]  Good, bro.
[1:44:06.220 --> 1:44:07.220]  Great last caller.
[1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:10.220]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:15.220]  It's basically the only way I get to sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization, and absurdity.
[1:44:15.220 --> 1:44:17.220]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:44:17.220 --> 1:44:19.220]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[1:44:19.220 --> 1:44:20.220]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:44:20.220 --> 1:44:21.220]  Go ahead.
[1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:22.220]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:44:22.220 --> 1:44:25.220]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:44:25.220 --> 1:44:27.220]  The XTube does wonders.
[1:44:27.220 --> 1:44:29.220]  I recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:44:29.220 --> 1:44:32.220]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the infowar.
[1:44:32.220 --> 1:44:34.220]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the air.
[1:44:34.220 --> 1:44:35.220]  Thanks for holding.
[1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:36.220]  Go ahead.
[1:44:36.220 --> 1:44:37.220]  Hey, Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[1:44:37.220 --> 1:44:38.220]  It's an honor.
[1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:39.220]  Honor, talk to you.
[1:44:39.220 --> 1:44:45.220]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:44:45.220 --> 1:44:47.220]  If you ask my better half, she loves it.
[1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:49.220]  All right, it helps in the bedroom.
[1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.220]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:44:51.220 --> 1:44:52.220]  Well, it definitely works.
[1:44:52.220 --> 1:44:53.220]  It's not a joke.
[1:44:53.220 --> 1:44:54.220]  Absolutely.
[1:44:54.220 --> 1:44:57.220]  3, 2, 1.
[1:44:57.220 --> 1:44:58.220]  3, 2, 1.
[1:44:58.220 --> 1:45:00.220]  3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2.
[1:45:00.220 --> 1:45:01.220]  Go ahead.
[1:45:01.220 --> 1:45:04.220]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:45:04.220 --> 1:45:06.220]  Can I plug, Alex, real quick?
[1:45:06.220 --> 1:45:07.220]  Yeah, go ahead.

[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:44.240]  and let's not forget that dem super lawyer Mark Elias has been working with this
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:49.680]  former group editorial candidate Andrew Gillum who's now been indicted by the FBI
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:55.080]  this is a real window into the satanic underbelly of the new world order how a
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:47:58.120]  guy they thought was about to be governor they were getting all the dirt
[1:47:58.120 --> 1:48:05.080]  they needed but our guest Jacob Ingalls got it out before the election and helped
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:10.360]  derail what he was doing and to great detriment to his his own self but
[1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:14.560]  that's what it takes to win these fights so so how big is this and where do you
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:17.880]  see this going with him and died it now and again for listeners just tuned in
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:23.680]  why has he been indicted well he's been indicted on 19 counts of wire fraud and
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.120]  then I believe two other counts of making false statements to the FBI
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:32.480]  essentially what he was doing when he announced his run for governor in 2017
[1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:37.760]  he had to resign to run that's the rule in Florida so he lost his salary as
[1:48:37.760 --> 1:48:42.840]  mayor of Tallahassee and they concocted this scheme with one of his friends one
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:48.560]  of his longtime associates where she would create a company that then would be
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:53.880]  hired by his campaign and his political committee and then he would get a chunk
[1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:58.760]  of it on the back end nobody knew that but that's what happened and that's
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.080]  where we see this wire fraud charges coming from where he was getting 10
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:08.000]  20 30 thousand dollars a month unbeknownst to the donors and everyone
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:11.880]  else who thought giving money for his campaign and his political committee not
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:17.400]  for his personal enrichment why do you think it's obviously the Justice
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:20.880]  Department's totally deep state controlled why did they burn him because
[1:49:20.880 --> 1:49:24.560]  he knows too much and now that he'll be indicted he'll be discredited because he
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:31.200]  was obviously big buddies with Barack Obama I'm not sure I have kind of two
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:36.720]  thoughts on this Alex so either he was flying a little little too far from the
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:42.640]  reservation for them or they've charged him and we'll all spend the next couple
[1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:45.880]  of months wow this is great finally somebody's charge finally the Biden
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:51.320]  Justice Department gets something right and then what will result is a Roger
[1:49:51.320 --> 1:49:56.160]  Stone style jury except in the favor of Gillum where he gets off and they get
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:01.280]  to rebrand him and rebuild him so that that's kind of the two angles I'm
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:04.440]  thinking I think they might be taking him down a few notches and then let him
[1:50:04.440 --> 1:50:08.560]  off and then having that understanding with him going forward that you are
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:12.480]  completely and totally under our control
[1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:17.840]  what about DeSantis you know I know he went to Yale people say Trojan horse
[1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:21.480]  but he's gone up against big pharma he's come out against the vaccines for
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:26.000]  little kids he is just I don't see anybody at the level he's at doing what
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:31.080]  he's doing I really like DeSantis and I like Trump too but Trump was all in he's
[1:50:31.080 --> 1:50:34.880]  still in with warp speed I mean I got to tell you have national polls show this
[1:50:34.880 --> 1:50:39.280]  too that DeSantis can beat Trump and that DeSantis in New Hampshire another
[1:50:39.280 --> 1:50:44.560]  battleground States is way out of Trump what's your take on that well some of
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:47.680]  the polling I've seen in the state of Florida Alex over the past six months
[1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:53.640]  we've seen a market reduction in questions like are you more or less
[1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:59.040]  likely to vote for a candidate that is endorsed by Donald Trump and then when
[1:50:59.040 --> 1:51:03.960]  you go to DeSantis we've seen a market increase on questions like that from
[1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:08.200]  some of the reporting I've done and polling I've seen I think for President
[1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:12.600]  Trump he should have gotten credit more credit than he ever got for operation
[1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:16.720]  warp speed I don't think anybody denies that but I think when he was on that
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:20.600]  tour with Bill O'Reilly a couple of months ago and really pushing the hard
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:26.400]  hard sell on the vaccine and the boosters I think we saw an opening
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:30.840]  there for DeSantis who who has kind of taken a different approach so a lot of
[1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:36.880]  people are saying DeSantis is the Trump kind of candidate in 2024 without the
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:44.620]  baggage you're saying you're saying he's people think he's Trump 2.0 yeah I can
[1:51:44.620 --> 1:51:48.560]  ask a lot of questions Jacob Ingalls of CentralFordipost.com but what else is on
[1:51:48.560 --> 1:51:52.040]  your radar screen what else you want in part to viewers about Florida's become
[1:51:52.040 --> 1:51:57.320]  the real battleground for America well we have a race in Central Florida Alex
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.800]  congressional District 7 this was held by Stephanie Murphy who you know we've
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:05.360]  talked about on this program she's one of the impeachment hoaxer she's one of
[1:52:05.360 --> 1:52:11.440]  the J6 committee members she had to resign earlier this year after I reported
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.160]  that her husband had ties to China through their company which manufactures
[1:52:16.160 --> 1:52:21.080]  sportswear products almost 97% of their products manufactured in China so now
[1:52:21.080 --> 1:52:26.560]  we have this eight-way race in Central Florida where you have these candidates
[1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:31.320]  who are wearing the MAGA mantle but then I'm looking into their history one of
[1:52:31.320 --> 1:52:35.160]  them is a lobbyist for the Asian-American Pacific Chamber of Commerce tied to the
[1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:40.720]  CCP one of them just got endorsed by I patch McCain Dan Crenshaw they're
[1:52:40.720 --> 1:52:44.640]  taking gambling money they're taking money from corrupt convicted land
[1:52:44.640 --> 1:52:48.920]  developers and political fixers and so you only really have one or two
[1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:53.320]  candidates in races like this that you can trust and voters just really need to
[1:52:53.320 --> 1:52:58.960]  educate themselves I mean we have one guy Corey Mills who is a combat veteran
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:02.800]  he's one of the people who helped the airlift out of Afghanistan on his own
[1:53:02.800 --> 1:53:06.160]  dime and then you have state representative Anthony Sabatini who's
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:11.920]  running on the MAGA line and then you have six fakes so voters in Florida and
[1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:15.520]  across the country really do your homework because these people can slap a
[1:53:15.520 --> 1:53:20.640]  MAGA sticker on their car they can say America first but they are trying to get
[1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.320]  the Liz Cheney's back in control well a great example that is Dr. Oz in
[1:53:25.320 --> 1:53:29.120]  Pennsylvania the minute he wins the Republican primary he's done with Trump
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:34.240]  takes him off his website absolutely and everybody saw that coming we all saw
[1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:38.300]  that coming and and what did Sean Hannity do you know Sean Hannity I'm so
[1:53:38.300 --> 1:53:42.720]  sorry you know the way he savaged cat Kathy Barnett the way he propped Dr. Oz
[1:53:42.720 --> 1:53:52.600]  what's going on now what is going on we've got Dr. Oz and the guy's gonna
[1:53:52.600 --> 1:53:56.960]  come grab our guns he's pro-abortion he's a gun grabber Alex the voters got
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:54:01.560]  snowed what do you make Jacob Ingalls of the Roe v Wade ruling and also this
[1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:08.240]  pro-second amendment ruling that's so huge well I think the agents of Malik
[1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:13.160]  and and the demonically possessed are gonna have a very busy couple of weeks
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:16.840]  ahead of them and I think it's gonna be very dangerous and they've already
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:20.240]  planned to shut down the Supreme Court I got a text message that you might have
[1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:24.240]  heard it come through on the program here I got a text message alert from one
[1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:27.720]  of these groups that they're going to shut down the Supreme Court by any
[1:54:27.720 --> 1:54:32.960]  means necessary tonight at 5 p.m. and I just really encourage and caution people
[1:54:32.960 --> 1:54:36.600]  in your communities when these are protests when there are celebrations of
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:42.360]  the ruling from the pro-life crowd really watch yourself really really be
[1:54:42.360 --> 1:54:47.640]  safe because these people are going to get violent
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:53.920]  well said my friend it is certainly a crazy crazy time to be alive right now
[1:54:53.920 --> 1:54:59.280]  what do you make a Biden blaming gas stations for gas prices nobody bought
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:03.640]  the Putin thing so now he's moved on to gas stations anybody that knows that
[1:55:03.640 --> 1:55:07.480]  business knows they lose money on average on gas or make almost no money
[1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:13.120]  what an incredible stable and he's the one shutting down energy well we just
[1:55:13.120 --> 1:55:17.120]  see this ping-pong back and forth right Alex first it's well this is part of the
[1:55:17.120 --> 1:55:21.600]  transition Jennifer Granholm says it's part of the transition then the press
[1:55:21.600 --> 1:55:25.320]  secretary says oh there's no recession there's no problem with gas prices oh
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:30.000]  just get an electric car Jen Psaki all these others Biden has gone back and
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:33.680]  forth vacillating on this issue so I think right now they're just sitting
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:38.440]  there in the White House whack-a-mole on what excuse can we give and and and what
[1:55:38.440 --> 1:55:42.960]  excuse are the American people gonna buy but at the end of the day it's it's
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:46.800]  crazy I was walking through the grocery store yesterday and there was not a
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:54.280]  single piece of chicken poultry beef the only thing that was left in in the meat
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:56:01.480]  section was the big tube of the processed ground beef that you know I I mean so
[1:56:01.480 --> 1:56:04.480]  that the gas prices are affecting all these other parts of our life and I
[1:56:04.480 --> 1:56:07.720]  think the Biden administration just thinks we're so stupid well we'll take
[1:56:07.720 --> 1:56:10.840]  whatever excuse they throw out every other day well that's right all right
[1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:14.720]  Jacob Ingalls center for the post calm great job we really appreciate you
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:18.140]  without Jacob Ingalls we would not have a governor to stand us right now so he

[1:58:01.880 --> 1:58:06.520]  talked about is gonna become more important than ever because the globalist
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:12.120]  aren't hiding it anymore in policy reports and documents it's now out on the
[1:58:12.120 --> 1:58:17.320]  open. Klaus Schwab said last week that they rule the earth the Bilderberg group
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:22.840]  founded Davos Group so now the fight's out in the open they're making their move

[1:59:53.240 --> 1:59:56.840]  you are the resistance
[2:00:10.200 --> 2:00:14.520]  tonight the only group that continues to enthusiastically support joe biden
[2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:18.120]  is college educated white voters in urban areas particularly middle-aged
[2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:21.880]  women with unhappy personal lives if you've got more than three cats and an
[2:00:21.880 --> 2:00:24.440]  npr tote bag and wear a mask alone in the car
[2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:28.440]  you are all in everyone else is running away
[2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:33.080]  effectively what we're seeing is the end of the modern democratic party
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:38.600]  even msnbc is noticed this speaks to a story we've been talking about the 2020
[2:00:38.600 --> 2:00:42.040]  election specifically along the border the real grand valley
[2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:45.160]  south we have seen county after county whether it's in
[2:00:45.160 --> 2:00:47.720]  this district or some of the districts to the west of it
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:51.400]  where voters have moved 10 20 30 40 points
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:55.080]  away from the democrats and toward the republicans this district
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:00.520]  that my reflores won last night barack obama got more than 60% of the vote here
[2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:03.800]  when he last ran in 2012 hillary clinton won this district
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:08.440]  by 22 points it shifted that dramatically joe biden carried it by four
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:12.680]  in 2020 and now in a special election a republican candidate has won it
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:18.920]  outright barack obama got more than 60 percent of the vote in that district
[2:01:18.920 --> 2:01:23.400]  now it's republican this is an historic moment
[2:01:23.400 --> 2:01:26.760]  joe biden has destroyed the democratic coalition
[2:01:26.760 --> 2:01:29.880]  so the question is since we have only two political parties
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:34.120]  how are republican leaders responding to this fact to this opportunity
[2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:37.800]  are they making the case for a better way are they offering an alternative to
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:40.440]  what the democrats have brought this country
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:43.480]  no they're not they're doing something you never
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.920]  would have expected republican leaders are siding with joe biden
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:52.280]  at the very moment that joe biden is at his weakest
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:57.160]  months before a pivotal midterm election republicans are propping him up
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:02.200]  they are saving biden from himself since the day biden was elected republicans
[2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:05.240]  in washington have taken biden's side on virtually every
[2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:08.680]  significant item in his policy agenda that would include
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:13.400]  covid restrictions vaccine mandates transgender ideology in schools
[2:02:13.400 --> 2:02:16.840]  sanctions against china the january 6th charade
[2:02:16.840 --> 2:02:21.080]  free speech civil liberties spying by the intel agencies
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:25.240]  preserving the big tech monopolies the anti-white race politics of crt and
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:29.640]  juneteenth border enforcement and energy policy and above all the
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:33.960]  administration's signature issue it's lunatic and reckless support
[2:02:33.960 --> 2:02:36.840]  for the war on ukraine republicans are all in
[2:02:36.840 --> 2:02:40.360]  it's called kiv now that's the republican message
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:44.440]  heading into the midterm elections it's called kiv
[2:02:44.440 --> 2:02:47.160]  and by the way this isn't just happening in washington
[2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:50.680]  it is endemic among the leaders of solidly republican states in fact the
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:02:54.680]  more republican the state the more liberal the governor tends to be
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:58.440]  the governor of texas which has some of the biggest oil and gas deposits
[2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:02.520]  in the world has decided to build windmills that don't work
[2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:07.480]  the governor of utah a state where joe biden got 37 percent of the vote
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:11.240]  that governor begins conversations by announcing his preferred pronouns
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:15.960]  he really does watch well i thank you so much
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:20.840]  gabby for that that question um and uh my preferred pronouns are he him and
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:25.880]  his uh so so thank you for sharing yours with me
[2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:31.000]  it goes on and on and on the governor of south dakota where joe biden got
[2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:34.120]  35 percent of the total vote less than two years ago
[2:03:34.120 --> 2:03:37.320]  that governor tried to let female impersonators destroy women's sports in
[2:03:37.320 --> 2:03:40.360]  south dakota in texas both senators can't stop talking
[2:03:40.360 --> 2:03:44.520]  about how great juneteenth is in arkansas one of the most
[2:03:44.520 --> 2:03:48.040]  conservative states in the country the governor supports the chemical
[2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:52.200]  castration of children the most recent action of the general
[2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:57.880]  assembly while well intended is off course and i must veto
[2:03:57.880 --> 2:04:03.160]  house bill 1570 and just like that a bill to restrict children under 18 from
[2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:06.840]  receiving chemical treatments or having surgery for gender reassignment has
[2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:09.400]  been stopped the governor said this bill is government
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:13.800]  overreach interfering by the state in a parent
[2:04:13.800 --> 2:04:17.480]  in a child in a doctor patient relationship
[2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:22.680]  did not make sense to me when you vote republican in arkansas
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:25.640]  you're voting for the castration of children how many republican voters in
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:29.080]  arkansas knew that when they voted for their republican governor
[2:04:29.080 --> 2:04:32.360]  but it's everywhere apart from governor ron desantis in florida
[2:04:32.360 --> 2:04:35.560]  very few republican office holders are pushing back in
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:38.680]  any way against anything joe biden is doing in fact
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:43.320]  they're abetting what he's doing effectively they're coming to joe biden's
[2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:47.480]  rescue why are they doing this why do you think they're
[2:04:47.480 --> 2:04:51.640]  doing it because fundamentally they're on joe biden's side that's right
[2:04:51.640 --> 2:04:58.120]  just joe brown coming up stay with us
[2:04:58.120 --> 2:05:01.480]  there's an old bedouin saying that's thousands of years old
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:06.200]  and it goes like this trust in god but tie up your camel
[2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:10.440]  hunter s thompson put it this way pray to god but row away from the rocks
[2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:14.360]  if your boat is going towards the rocks pray to god that you don't get smashed
[2:05:14.360 --> 2:05:17.640]  on him and killed but also try to row away you can't just sit there like a

[2:06:12.680 --> 2:06:16.280]  it's alex jones
[2:06:16.280 --> 2:06:20.920]  and judge joe brown the balance of the hour we already had it set up a few days
[2:06:20.920 --> 2:06:24.760]  ago we're so glad it's here today with this big breaking news but first here's
[2:06:24.760 --> 2:06:29.080]  biden just minutes ago giving a speech saying a constitutional right
[2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:32.440]  of americans to kill their babies has been taken away
[2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:37.000]  today the supreme court of the united states expressly took away
[2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.880]  a constitutional right from the american people
[2:06:39.880 --> 2:06:44.600]  that it has already recognized they didn't limit it
[2:06:44.600 --> 2:06:48.920]  they simply took it away that's never been done
[2:06:48.920 --> 2:06:54.040]  to a right so important to so many americans but they did it
[2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:58.760]  it's a sad day for the court and for the country
[2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:03.800]  so there's the kkk sympathizer that judge joe brown
[2:07:03.800 --> 2:07:07.400]  witnessed as a young man say incredibly evil
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:12.680]  hateful discriminatory things up there as the president
[2:07:12.680 --> 2:07:16.680]  saying that a right has been taken away we were going to get him on about
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:20.360]  i saw him on one of our other shows in a great job harrison smith's
[2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:26.680]  american journal last week laying out just how out of control this january 6th
[2:07:26.680 --> 2:07:30.920]  committee is swearing people in but then editing videos and letting
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:34.120]  witnesses hear what witnesses had to say and so much more
[2:07:34.120 --> 2:07:37.960]  he'll cover that later but today the supreme court ruling on
[2:07:37.960 --> 2:07:41.160]  roe v wade yesterday's ruling on the second amendment
[2:07:41.160 --> 2:07:45.880]  saying new york other states can't bar concealed carries this is a big
[2:07:45.880 --> 2:07:50.280]  big deal what a historic moment what is the aftermath what does it really mean
[2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:53.640]  what does he expect about to happen the left is already all over the news saying
[2:07:53.640 --> 2:07:57.560]  they're gonna peacefully burn down america this weekend
[2:07:57.560 --> 2:08:00.600]  judge joe brown you've got the floor my friend great to have you back great
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:04.920]  patriot people can visit your website the judge joe brown show dot com
[2:08:04.920 --> 2:08:09.720]  on twitter at judge joe brown tv uh i saw you on earlier this week with one of
[2:08:09.720 --> 2:08:13.160]  our crew amazing hour thank you for spending time with us
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:16.280]  i could ask a lot of questions but where do you want to go from what i just laid
[2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:20.920]  out okay let's start off with new york's reaction
[2:08:20.920 --> 2:08:27.640]  city mayor's reaction to uh the ruling about the constitutional right
[2:08:27.640 --> 2:08:31.880]  to be armed in public i think it is a good thing
[2:08:31.880 --> 2:08:39.160]  but our lawless mayor gets up there and not our but the lawless mayor gets up
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:44.600]  there and he advocates right disobedience of
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:49.560]  of ruling by the u.s supreme court i wonder if these hypocrites on the clown
[2:08:49.560 --> 2:08:55.080]  show with the j6 committee would be interested in that because that sounds
[2:08:55.080 --> 2:09:01.240]  just like what they were accusing mr trump of doing i wonder if they want to
[2:09:01.240 --> 2:09:07.240]  pay attention to joe biden doing what he did today which is inviting
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:13.720]  disobedience of the latest ruling by the u.s supreme court
[2:09:13.720 --> 2:09:18.280]  and their support for what is bound to be some
[2:09:18.280 --> 2:09:23.240]  righteous behavior in the streets by certain
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:30.040]  groups uh this hypocrisy is awful and then the thing that we hear about uh
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:34.840]  the arkansas governor which to me is right over the bridge
[2:09:34.840 --> 2:09:41.240]  here since i live in memphis it strikes me that uh
[2:09:41.240 --> 2:09:45.160]  some things are being missed if a child is injured
[2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:51.560]  in an accident they have to get the parent a guardian in order to
[2:09:51.560 --> 2:09:59.000]  get permission to perform surgery on this child all right unless it's a dire
[2:09:59.000 --> 2:10:02.040]  emergency and there's a cadre of doctors that
[2:10:02.040 --> 2:10:08.280]  go along with saying we have to well why do we have this support for
[2:10:08.280 --> 2:10:13.080]  elective surgery where somebody can cut their dick and balls off to
[2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:16.600]  put it crudely and they're only 15 years old
[2:10:16.600 --> 2:10:21.400]  that doesn't make any sense in this whole position is based on some logical
[2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:26.600]  inconsistencies and it just shows the hypocrisy of the left
[2:10:26.600 --> 2:10:30.600]  they want what they want they don't give a damn about anything else any other
[2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:34.920]  considerations except their personal exercise of
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.960]  license rather than responsible exercise of rights and this isn't to
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:45.240]  right because children under the law are entitled to
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:49.400]  appropriate supervision they are not adults and they cannot sign
[2:10:49.400 --> 2:10:53.400]  contracts they cannot make binding agreements but
[2:10:53.400 --> 2:10:59.640]  having your genitals removed or your sex change
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:05.960]  is certainly a binding contractual agreement between the child and somebody
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:09.320]  in the state let me stop because some stations don't care that first five
[2:11:09.320 --> 2:11:13.080]  minutes for those who just joined us Tucker Carlson clip i played that
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:16.120]  little no man's land first five minutes of some stations carrying some down
[2:11:16.120 --> 2:11:19.160]  was making the point that the arkansas governor overrode and veto the
[2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:22.520]  legislature uh saying that we're not going to sterilize
[2:11:22.520 --> 2:11:26.440]  and cut the genitals off children if you or i walked into a hospital today in
[2:11:26.440 --> 2:11:31.320]  minnesota tennessee or austin texas or new york new york or la and said i want
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:35.000]  my arm cut off they'd call a patty wagon to take us to a mental
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.760]  institution but if we want to hell in europe it's as young as seven here as
[2:11:38.760 --> 2:11:44.360]  young as ten as you said the average age 15 cut the penis and balls off a child
[2:11:44.360 --> 2:11:47.800]  then we don't want the parents involved the state said the kid wants to be another
[2:11:47.800 --> 2:11:50.760]  gender it's about tagging because you know arkansas
[2:11:50.760 --> 2:11:53.800]  claiming parental rights in some cases the state's coming in and trying to
[2:11:53.800 --> 2:11:57.560]  overwrite that so this is mental illness on its face
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:00.520]  being pushed by the state so what you're saying is out of the abortion
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:05.080]  out of the gun control rulings i agree with you this transgender movement is
[2:12:05.080 --> 2:12:09.400]  the next leg of what they're doing and it's just outrageous but again
[2:12:09.400 --> 2:12:13.160]  you're a judge but am i not wrong that if i walked into a hospital and said i
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:16.840]  want you to cut my right leg off they'd put me in a mental institution but i
[2:12:16.840 --> 2:12:20.760]  say my right right leg is not as important as my
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:24.120]  dick and balls as you said because that's how i make new people that is a
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:28.200]  direct attack on my whole family line who i am and everything and i'd say
[2:12:28.200 --> 2:12:32.840]  before i wanted my testicles cut off i'd rather have my leg cut off
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:36.200]  well you're right it's it's an inconsistency it's a
[2:12:36.200 --> 2:12:40.600]  hypocrisy it's just a selfish focus on immediate
[2:12:40.600 --> 2:12:43.880]  hedonistic pleasure without any understanding
[2:12:43.880 --> 2:12:47.800]  or respect for the other issues that are brought up
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:52.760]  i mean what's more revocable than that and then i tell a joke about it what do
[2:12:52.760 --> 2:12:58.520]  you see whenever you see a human a man or a woman
[2:12:58.520 --> 2:13:05.160]  no you see a successful screw somebody's somebody is born somebody
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:09.880]  matures after they get ready that's right sex did that sex did that
[2:13:09.880 --> 2:13:14.440]  yeah they breathe and then you get the next generation so these folks want to
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:19.160]  cut it off because they can't handle it it's just absolutely ridiculous
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:23.800]  because even if the child is hurt in an accident you have to get a hold of a
[2:13:23.800 --> 2:13:26.760]  parent or a guardian in order to give permission
[2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:30.360]  for life-saving surgery so here is an elective
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:34.600]  for some reason that your child can't even fathom at that point because
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:37.400]  remember starting at eight nine years old
[2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:41.720]  in this state they were talking about having puberty blockers so the person
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:45.800]  is never getting to the point where they can't buy a pack of
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:49.000]  cigarettes or a gun they can't join the military but they can
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:53.400]  decide to have their balls cut off yeah after they've been allowed to take
[2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:57.240]  puberty blockers so they don't even get their first heart on to find out what
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:13:59.960]  it's all about exactly that's a good point they
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:03.080]  don't want you to know that's going to be the best part of your life right there
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:06.200]  they don't want you ever even experience that
[2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:09.400]  yeah i'm and let's see there's another thing to it
[2:14:09.400 --> 2:14:13.800]  part of this whole thing with the tranny thing has got to do with the lifeboat
[2:14:13.800 --> 2:14:17.080]  situation the next time the titanic goes down
[2:14:17.080 --> 2:14:20.360]  with that i don't know if lifeboats the men's are supposed to say
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:23.880]  ma'am you may have my seat you and your child i'll drown with
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:27.400]  ship when it goes down see that takes a whole lot but a lot of
[2:14:27.400 --> 2:14:31.400]  punks don't have that kind of manliness and they want to deal with
[2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:35.320]  oh i got on a dress i should be able to get in there
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:40.040]  my position's been no grab them snatch them throw them on the other side of
[2:14:40.040 --> 2:14:44.520]  the ship and chum to sharks so the women and children get away safe
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:47.480]  you know that's an abdication show brown you're right that's the perfect
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:51.560]  analogy of the lifeboats are here and there's much of men in dresses trying
[2:14:51.560 --> 2:14:58.040]  to kick out the girls and women yes see we have this thing i have a
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:01.640]  model it's all about protecting womanhood and
[2:15:01.640 --> 2:15:05.960]  promoting manhood why because the women are a resource they bear the
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:08.920]  children a man can technically fertilize
[2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:13.400]  quite a few women at the same time so we've always had this thing
[2:15:13.400 --> 2:15:18.360]  when the population goes down the more successful men they get around
[2:15:18.360 --> 2:15:24.680]  now we have monogamy but the men can procreate they go off we go off to the
[2:15:24.680 --> 2:15:31.000]  wars we guard the front doors we sacrifice ourselves to protect
[2:15:31.000 --> 2:15:36.040]  our wives and families and life goes on and
[2:15:36.040 --> 2:15:40.520]  your gene code gets continued because the mother birthed the children she
[2:15:40.520 --> 2:15:43.720]  could have been pregnant when you lost your life
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:46.680]  and it's what it is so beautifully said stay there sir
[2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:50.200]  i want to come back and more into this roe v way the gun amendment
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:55.080]  what the left's gonna do judge joe browns our guest stay with us
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:16:02.120]  at this point best case scenario is a few years of
[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:06.200]  hard times for us all and if we don't turn it around soon
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:10.360]  then it will only get worse but as bad as things are
[2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:13.800]  we still have time to prepare and that alone
[2:16:13.800 --> 2:16:17.400]  is something to be grateful for a gravity water filter

[2:20:55.880 --> 2:20:59.400]  the historic point we're at because you have a great historical
[2:20:59.400 --> 2:21:02.760]  of that dinner with you talk to you a lot and i've done a lot of history you
[2:21:02.760 --> 2:21:05.640]  know more than i do i've been blown away by your knowledge it's it's it's true
[2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:09.800]  folks well the smart people i know what is the moment we're at what is the
[2:21:09.800 --> 2:21:13.720]  choice humanity has because the left is just running around
[2:21:13.720 --> 2:21:16.840]  like chickens with their heads cut off what's their problem why don't they want
[2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:20.360]  success why don't they want order why don't they want freedom
[2:21:20.360 --> 2:21:24.600]  true liberalism which means freedom they're not the liberals to me they're
[2:21:24.600 --> 2:21:29.000]  the authoritarians what is how would you quantify judge brown
[2:21:29.000 --> 2:21:31.720]  where we are today
[2:21:32.200 --> 2:21:41.320]  55 years ago i had a course he was a visiting professor
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:47.080]  and professor said america is in grave danger of becoming a fascist country
[2:21:47.080 --> 2:21:51.160]  not from some jack booted goose stepping thugs
[2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:58.120]  but from as she turned it some pink panty wearing long haired hippies
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:04.360]  who would be glad to impose the worst methods of fascism on everybody for
[2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:09.160]  their own perceived good and that's what we're getting
[2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:12.200]  um
[2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:18.440]  what you're looking at is essentially an episode of two things one to make it
[2:22:18.440 --> 2:22:22.040]  real simple reed orwell's animal farm where the animal
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:26.360]  staged revolution and took over a farm and they had a constitution written on
[2:22:26.360 --> 2:22:29.960]  the side of a barn that said all animals are equal
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:34.760]  and then the pigs wound up pulling off a lot of stunts and taking some power in
[2:22:34.760 --> 2:22:39.720]  the constitution changed it said all animals are equal
[2:22:39.720 --> 2:22:44.120]  but pigs are more equal than others and that's what we have right now we've
[2:22:44.120 --> 2:22:48.840]  got a pig pen developing and it's there you go that was put out
[2:22:48.840 --> 2:22:54.680]  by the cia in 1952 uh to show in europe so what you
[2:22:54.680 --> 2:23:00.680]  have is a pig pen where we have a new category of pigs who
[2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:06.600]  are more equal than others one of the things that i find
[2:23:06.600 --> 2:23:11.400]  absolutely astonishing is this sense of entitlement
[2:23:11.400 --> 2:23:17.800]  wherein people say i wish upon a star makes no difference
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:23.080]  who i am my dream should come true you know makes no difference who you are
[2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:26.280]  your dreams will come true that's while disney nonsense
[2:23:26.280 --> 2:23:32.680]  and they've been fed a 50-some year course of intense propaganda from
[2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:37.080]  hollywood and other sources that all you have to do is want
[2:23:37.080 --> 2:23:41.000]  and you should have you see mothers that can barely
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:45.240]  pay the rent they get a little in their hand and they go out and buy their nine
[2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:49.960]  year old the 260-dollar pair of air jordan tennis shoes
[2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:55.160]  uh these kind of things where i want it so i should get it
[2:23:55.160 --> 2:24:00.360]  it's not necessary to go off and do all of these difficult things that are
[2:24:00.360 --> 2:24:05.480]  required becoming a human who is a free human
[2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:09.320]  we should be entitled to it and what i see
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:12.520]  is history repeating itself only this time it's
[2:24:12.520 --> 2:24:16.840]  not at state of america instead of great britain because
[2:24:16.840 --> 2:24:20.600]  if you look back to the 1920s you will see
[2:24:20.600 --> 2:24:25.400]  great britain just came out of the great war
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:32.680]  and they had this thing about social programs and they bankrupted themselves
[2:24:32.680 --> 2:24:36.120]  and by the end of world war two which was just 20
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:40.840]  some years away great britain quickly fell into being a third
[2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:45.480]  rate not even second rate power in the united states took its position
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:52.200]  now pakistan and india are much more powerful militarily economically
[2:24:52.200 --> 2:24:57.720]  scientifically and industrially than great britain used to be so
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:03.560]  instead of uh pertania ruling the waves and the royal
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:07.560]  navy controlling who moved on over under the
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:11.640]  oceans now they can't even man all their ships and what do they have
[2:25:11.640 --> 2:25:14.440]  so judge brown let me ask you this question that's where you're going
[2:25:14.440 --> 2:25:21.000]  why do why do empires commit suicide because they get too indulgent
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.920]  they get decadent degenerate and depraved
[2:25:24.920 --> 2:25:29.400]  they get more in love with their luxuries than they do with their freedom
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:34.600]  and they're willing to be safe excuse me they're willing to give up their
[2:25:34.600 --> 2:25:37.960]  freedom to be safe and to ensure their luxuries
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:41.720]  and you mentioned this biden to remove title
[2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:45.560]  nine for women's rights which i support women's rights
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:49.320]  in favor of gender identity letting men like you said on the titanic
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:53.080]  coming to take over that is crazy well yeah
[2:25:53.080 --> 2:25:58.760]  it's like see one thing i think there is a need for one constitutional
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:03.160]  amendment just one and that one would read
[2:26:03.160 --> 2:26:08.600]  something like the body of a bill or piece of legislation
[2:26:08.600 --> 2:26:14.120]  has to reflect the caption they introduced the imitial
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:20.040]  anti-lynch bill let's not go into all of the details but
[2:26:20.040 --> 2:26:23.800]  they added something which is
[2:26:25.000 --> 2:26:31.720]  gender orientation to the american legal lexicon or federal lexicon for the
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:36.840]  first time so that came in under a so-called anti-lynch
[2:26:36.840 --> 2:26:40.760]  bill but it applies now to all american law so
[2:26:40.760 --> 2:26:45.560]  what the hell do you mean by that you have ordinarily
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:49.320]  you can't discriminate against anyone because of race
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:58.440]  color national origin religion sex age medical condition
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:04.600]  and what we have now is a different kind of thing where somebody says i have
[2:27:04.600 --> 2:27:09.400]  an extra choice i can make i can be lying through my chief but if i'm
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:14.040]  punk enough to go out and say oh i'm a sissy then i can get
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:19.560]  declared to be a woman i might not be able to make the varsity so instead of
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:23.400]  sitting in the stands and cheering like everybody else who can't
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:29.320]  i get to go declare that i've got girl in me and put on a skirt no i want to be
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.640]  a girl in all this and i can go out and play with the girls
[2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:37.640]  and we even violate some old precepts like
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:41.960]  boys are stronger than girls therefore boys should never hit girl
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:45.560]  so now we have little punks out there in full contact
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:51.800]  courts crippling maiming and badly hurting we have UFC fighters killing
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:57.480]  women men killing women fighting women imagine if Mike Tyson was in a
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:00.920]  in the ring with a woman we would say arresting but oh if he saves a woman
[2:28:00.920 --> 2:28:05.240]  it's okay well this is personal to me uh not
[2:28:05.240 --> 2:28:10.520]  long ago i was at uh in the parking lot of
[2:28:10.520 --> 2:28:14.440]  uh well one of these discount

[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:43.480]  talk to me about her she'd been a martial artist since she'd been here

[2:33:36.360 --> 2:33:40.440]  so judge joe brown have just joined us was talking about
[2:33:40.440 --> 2:33:44.120]  women being beaten at the death in some cases to death
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:48.520]  by men and men women cycling contest and

[2:33:56.760 --> 2:33:59.880]  so you were getting into that and finishing up with a story you told
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:03.080]  about a woman you met and a parking lot that you've known for a long time you've
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:06.600]  forgotten about them you're obviously a celebrity don't meet a lot of people
[2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:10.840]  and then i want to ask you the big picture what do we do judge joe brown
[2:34:10.840 --> 2:34:13.720]  about this assault what is the average person listening due to
[2:34:13.720 --> 2:34:17.400]  to counter that please continue well let me tell you the story
[2:34:17.400 --> 2:34:22.040]  i hadn't seen her since she'd been about 11 years old she was 19 she grew up
[2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:26.360]  beautiful movie star beautiful but she had her arm in a cast and
[2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:30.200]  it was propped up shoulder to and i asked her what happened
[2:34:30.200 --> 2:34:33.160]  she had been a martial artist since she'd been eight or nine years old and
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:38.280]  she got a scholarship to a major university doing women's wrestling
[2:34:38.280 --> 2:34:43.640]  well right before covid hit heart she had been in a tournament and she was set
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:47.080]  up to wrestle this what turned out to be a guy
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:50.440]  she refused and so did another member of her team
[2:34:50.440 --> 2:34:53.800]  and they were told they would lose their scholarships and the team would forfeit
[2:34:53.800 --> 2:34:57.000]  if they didn't so the other woman got a broken
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:02.520]  jaw and put in a coma for three days and my friend's granddaughter got a
[2:35:02.520 --> 2:35:06.760]  compound fracture of her arm that this creek did to her
[2:35:06.760 --> 2:35:10.840]  and she was crying to me cried on my shoulder literally about she had to go
[2:35:10.840 --> 2:35:14.360]  through three surgeries how badly it hurt and that she
[2:35:14.360 --> 2:35:17.640]  couldn't stand the pain but when she took the medication
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:21.800]  she couldn't focus on her studies what was she going to do and it just wasn't
[2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:25.320]  fair well it was and these dirty creeps don't
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:29.400]  be a need to be allowed to compete against women they're sissies
[2:35:29.400 --> 2:35:33.960]  they're punks they need to sit in the damn bleachers like everybody else who
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:41.160]  can't make the men's team and this is just absolutely absurd
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:46.840]  it is absolutely unfair and it is dangerous now women have fought long
[2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:51.160]  and hard to get equality in sports and it doesn't make any damn
[2:35:51.160 --> 2:35:56.760]  sense to allow some creep who ought to be ashamed of himself to come in and
[2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:01.560]  cry to blame to be a girl and compete against the girls
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:07.640]  so it it's particularly repugnant and I commend all state legislative bodies
[2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:11.800]  that are doing something about it hell I saw a thing somebody called me up
[2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:15.000]  about just this week they had Bruce Jenner on there and he was
[2:36:15.000 --> 2:36:19.400]  talking about he thought it was unfair for guys to be allowed to
[2:36:19.400 --> 2:36:24.120]  compete against girls in women's sports
[2:36:24.120 --> 2:36:28.040]  and that's from a former male Olympic athlete
[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:32.440]  gold medal at the time or two in what was it swimming
[2:36:32.440 --> 2:36:37.400]  so it's gotten really far out of hand and we need to bring that back
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:41.240]  into focus you know just because you want something
[2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:44.520]  doesn't mean you should be able to get it just because you say
[2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:47.400]  you're an Easter Bunny doesn't make it sour Santa Claus
[2:36:47.400 --> 2:36:51.320]  so how do I counter this this madness judge brown
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:56.920]  I can fly we'll go jump off that each story building if you can fly then
[2:36:56.920 --> 2:37:00.680]  so how do we turn this madness where do you see America going
[2:37:00.680 --> 2:37:04.760]  speaking of which you're blind you can't drive a car
[2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:08.680]  I imagine there are a lot of blind people who would love to operate a car but they
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:13.960]  can't because they can't see so what do you suppose to do
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:17.400]  well it's the same thing I I mean I can fight but I couldn't be a heavyweight
[2:37:17.400 --> 2:37:19.640]  boxer get my ass kicked those are professionals
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:22.920]  the top one ten to one percent who train their whole lives
[2:37:22.920 --> 2:37:25.800]  the idea that I could be a marathon runner I could run two miles I can't run
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:29.480]  23 it's just so simple I mean it's just it's right
[2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:33.000]  there what let me bring us back to another thing
[2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:37.640]  all right just a bit about protecting everyone oh my god we're going into
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:41.320]  violence we're going to have rules against guns well okay they keep
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:44.760]  talking about assault rifles and what they're talking about a
[2:37:44.760 --> 2:37:47.720]  generally just seam autos and let's see
[2:37:47.720 --> 2:37:52.040]  interesting an anniversary passed three months ago
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:55.560]  the AR which stands for armillite design
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:38:03.080]  of stoner john eugene stoner who designed it
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:11.320]  was patented 70 years ago this year in february so this is not something new
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:17.160]  this is an antique ak-47 was adopted 75 years ago in
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:23.640]  1947 so this is nothing new we have some antique firearms and
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:26.760]  what people are putting out there with false
[2:38:26.760 --> 2:38:30.840]  propaganda is it their assault rifle no they're not
[2:38:30.840 --> 2:38:35.400]  a real assault rifle is a fully automatic weapon a machine gun
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:39.800]  you know like al Capone and
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:47.560]  elliot ness or whatever you may have or john wane charging a machine gun nest
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:51.080]  with his Thompson or whatever it may be
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:55.320]  so that isn't even the issue in switzerland
[2:38:55.320 --> 2:39:02.040]  every able-bodied man from 17 to 56 is required to have a military grade
[2:39:02.040 --> 2:39:05.480]  nine millimeter pistol in his possession
[2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:10.200]  and a machine gun a fully automatic
[2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:16.600]  a real one and two hand grenades and various incendiary rounds of ammunition
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:22.760]  but they don't have any of these crazed fools running around killing folk off in
[2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:26.680]  mass now every now and then seems a banker or two
[2:39:26.680 --> 2:39:31.560]  over in switzerland had to get his drugs but one or two of them might get off
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:34.600]  by somebody that came in from out of the country
[2:39:34.600 --> 2:39:39.160]  but had got a violent crime is zero and it brings it to me now i'm
[2:39:39.160 --> 2:39:43.080]  74 years old but i've been taking martial arts for
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:48.760]  55 years and myself and some of my associates we can kill most humans who
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:53.160]  are comparably trained very quickly a lot quicker than we could kill them with
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:57.720]  a pistol or fire on or an ar which is only a 20
[2:39:57.720 --> 2:40:00.600]  exactly so we want to punish criminals not the general public let me ask this
[2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:04.200]  question then how do we fix this an awakening
[2:40:04.200 --> 2:40:08.680]  education i mean it seems like america is going over cliff
[2:40:08.680 --> 2:40:12.840]  it's we're going over a cliff because we've attempted to emasculate the
[2:40:12.840 --> 2:40:15.640]  country in favor of these people who want to
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:19.000]  let children at 15 cut the dicks and balls off
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:23.400]  so stop letting the left bully us and stop laying down the answer
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:27.880]  yeah well yes and the other thing is is let's take this thing about bullying
[2:40:27.880 --> 2:40:31.080]  look at back to the future back in the 1980s
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:36.200]  mcflagg goes back talked his father into standing up for himself dad
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:39.880]  busts the bully in his mouth knocks him out when
[2:40:39.880 --> 2:40:43.480]  young mcflagg gets back the bully works for his dad
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:48.200]  instead of running rough shot over him we've always had this thing
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:53.480]  in human society of boys becoming men had to learn up
[2:40:53.480 --> 2:40:57.000]  and stand up and screw up that's right they don't want us going to that
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:41:00.040]  process of that they're really afraid of men
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:05.000]  yeah they don't like it so we have had a 55 year campaign to emasculate the
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.040]  country i heard this starting back in the mid 60s
[2:41:08.040 --> 2:41:14.840]  when i was at UCLA as an undergrad uh you had the lesbians who hated men
[2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:19.000]  uh the feminists who hated that they weren't men
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:22.600]  the beta boys that hated it that they couldn't be real men
[2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:25.880]  the gay folk that didn't understand being a man
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:30.360]  and then you got that anti-war crowd in there and it said war is a man thing so
[2:41:30.360 --> 2:41:34.120]  if we raise boys like girls so they are emotional
[2:41:34.120 --> 2:41:39.320]  and they uh cry and shout and let it all hang out
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:42.840]  even if you cried and shouted did it all hang out instead of being
[2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:47.480]  so we'll take that we would step forward it
[2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:50.760]  so you get all of these together and they started to
[2:41:50.760 --> 2:41:56.680]  try to and to an extent accomplish the emasculation of the country
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:02.360]  meanwhile january 21st 2021 the chinese government put in place an
[2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:08.200]  official man up campaign and russia's already had one in about 10 12 15 years
[2:42:08.200 --> 2:42:12.600]  ago they banned americans from adopting russian
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:17.240]  orphans because they did not want them turned to the dark side now i'm not
[2:42:17.240 --> 2:42:21.640]  talking about gay folk per se i mean if you want to get your freak
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:25.320]  on in your bedroom that's your damn business what i'm talking about is the
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:31.000]  lgbtq cult the rainbow cult now
[2:42:31.000 --> 2:42:37.800]  judeism islam christianity hinduism confucianism boatism they're all
[2:42:37.800 --> 2:42:40.840]  religions but the last two don't have a god
[2:42:40.840 --> 2:42:46.440]  they're systems of philosophy so if you look at lgbtq the cult that way you'll
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:49.160]  see what i'm talking about just around stay there i want to talk
[2:42:49.160 --> 2:42:52.200]  about january 6th committee i want to talk about

[2:42:57.320 --> 2:43:01.480]  there's an old bedouin saying that's thousands of years old and it goes like

[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:09.640]  hunter s thompson put it this way pray to god but row away from the rocks

[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:12.680]  trump what do you make of biden how long can he hold on
[2:48:12.680 --> 2:48:16.440]  when it's on record he doesn't even know who he is
[2:48:16.440 --> 2:48:21.080]  just big picture what do you see with russia and ukraine just just big picture
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:24.200]  in the world where do you see all this going is i really want to hear what you
[2:48:24.200 --> 2:48:29.560]  have to say well brief comment on this
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:32.920]  committee some of the people that are on this january 6
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:37.160]  committee and supporting what they're doing and saying that trump was wrong
[2:48:37.160 --> 2:48:42.280]  by trying to incite the american public when he said the election was stolen
[2:48:42.280 --> 2:48:47.080]  hell some of them were up 22 years ago in the 2000
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:54.040]  election cycles screaming from the rooftops that
[2:48:54.040 --> 2:48:59.000]  bush had stolen the election from gore and i remember that old thing with
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:05.560]  dangling chads and the debacle down in florida that went on and on so
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:08.680]  what's the matter they can talk but nobody else can but
[2:49:08.680 --> 2:49:13.000]  anyway i don't have much confidence in biden
[2:49:13.000 --> 2:49:19.160]  and mrs emhoff that administration handling what is likely to develop with
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:26.600]  the russians down in syria the russian
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:33.640]  air force did an attention getting bombing or attack on
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:40.200]  a certain rebel base where americans had been training
[2:49:40.200 --> 2:49:43.400]  some of the folk going back up to the ukraine
[2:49:43.400 --> 2:49:49.400]  that could lead to a shooting incident or two or three or four ten or twenty down
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:54.520]  there in that area and i don't think biden and emhoff are competent
[2:49:54.520 --> 2:49:57.240]  to handle it that's right that's really smart what you're saying is i haven't
[2:49:57.240 --> 2:50:01.400]  covered that but i meant to a few days ago this war is widening into syria
[2:50:01.400 --> 2:50:05.560]  turkey you name it yeah and it's getting out of hand
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:09.720]  and i have a sneaking suspicion that the reason we're over in the ukraine in the
[2:50:09.720 --> 2:50:12.840]  first place is so biden can get this
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:16.040]  hundred and twenty some count indictment against him
[2:50:16.040 --> 2:50:24.600]  dismissed uh for services rendered because you still have
[2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  article well well that's the next question why would he brag
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:32.760]  five years ago on c-span that he ordered the prosecutor fired they wouldn't give
[2:50:32.760 --> 2:50:36.440]  him a million dollars before he left office into well why would you brag
[2:50:36.440 --> 2:50:42.200]  about crimes you committed not a million it was 14 billion in american
[2:50:42.200 --> 2:50:47.400]  loan guarantees he said i guess i am guilty of bribery
[2:50:47.400 --> 2:50:53.160]  and extortion because i told them that i'd see to it that they're 14 billion
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:56.920]  dollars in loan guarantee no i agree judge i agree you're
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:51:01.000]  right it's on record why would he admit that well i'm asking you why he said
[2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:04.280]  he's a fool he's never been the brightest bulb
[2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:09.080]  on sale in the store now that being the case
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:14.360]  it's a real live mess see article six of the u.s constitution says
[2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:18.520]  ratified treaties are part of the supreme law of the land and one of our
[2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:23.240]  ratified treaties is with ukraine and it says we will
[2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:27.800]  honor agreements with them to apprehend and assist in the investment so they're
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:31.080]  using that as a blank check of prep element
[2:51:31.080 --> 2:51:34.440]  so and then they set up another one and i love this one
[2:51:34.440 --> 2:51:38.760]  when they went after mr trump and impeached him the second time
[2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:42.840]  although he was no longer in office they set the precedent
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:47.640]  so article two section four of the constitution says impeachment for bribe
[2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:53.240]  well bribery treason and high crimes and misdemeanors in office those three
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:57.960]  things well he's already admitted he's into bribery
[2:51:57.960 --> 2:52:02.440]  we have indictments in ukraine charging him with bribery
[2:52:02.440 --> 2:52:07.160]  extortion etc etc that's certainly a high crime
[2:52:07.160 --> 2:52:12.920]  and or mr office and while we will be even though he's no longer vice
[2:52:12.920 --> 2:52:17.320]  president they already set the stage so when the democratic party
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:20.600]  gets their behinds kicked in these midterms
[2:52:20.600 --> 2:52:24.760]  what with their approval ratings being so damn low
[2:52:24.760 --> 2:52:29.240]  they've opened it up to go after biden and the reason they went after mr
[2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:33.400]  trump was because of the 12th amendment that says if you've been impeached you
[2:52:33.400 --> 2:52:37.240]  can't hold any office again no i agree with you so i'm asking
[2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:40.760]  why would the democratic party commit suicide like this
[2:52:40.760 --> 2:52:44.840]  they don't know any better they don't think the rules apply to them they are
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:50.120]  myopic in this site they have this oh this is what i want it's like a child
[2:52:50.120 --> 2:52:54.120]  wanting an ice cream cone and they throw a tantrum and they forget
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:57.480]  about everything outside of that ice cream cone
[2:52:57.480 --> 2:53:01.880]  or candy or you see them pitching a tantrum
[2:53:01.880 --> 2:53:05.320]  in the aisles at a department store when you get to the
[2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:10.120]  toy department they stomp and they carry on and they
[2:53:10.120 --> 2:53:14.440]  bang their fist on the ground and they roll all over the place and they're
[2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:18.920]  screeching i want it i want it and they don't care about what's going on
[2:53:18.920 --> 2:53:22.840]  that's because they are essentially immature
[2:53:22.840 --> 2:53:25.560]  they agree and that's why they've run their cities in the ground everything
[2:53:25.560 --> 2:53:28.840]  you're right that's scary though no the people in charge of the country do you
[2:53:28.840 --> 2:53:32.760]  see biden today blame gas stations for gas prices
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:37.160]  oh yeah and then look at this you know what the travesty is for those gas
[2:53:37.160 --> 2:53:41.400]  prices is this uh
[2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:48.680]  the crude oil that has been refined and is on sale right now
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:54.680]  was acquired 13 14 months ago at those prices and a great deal of it has been
[2:53:54.680 --> 2:53:58.680]  fooled out of reserves thanks to bag exactly so it's about to explode in
[2:53:58.680 --> 2:54:05.000]  price the price is from 40 50 60 70
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:09.080]  years ago now here's another thing 99
[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:15.480]  percent of all domestically consumed oil is imported
[2:54:15.480 --> 2:54:19.880]  we don't have any alternative energy sources being funded they need to have
[2:54:19.880 --> 2:54:23.320]  a manhattan project on that like they did with the bomb
[2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:26.760]  during world war two but biden's administration
[2:54:26.760 --> 2:54:32.440]  is pushing this so when you have imported oil what happens is 25 percent
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:37.960]  has to go into the american oil reserves and by law
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:43.080]  the oil importers get paid five dollars per barrel
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:48.920]  for whatever market price is for what goes into the reserve so they're making
[2:54:48.920 --> 2:54:54.200]  money hand over foot and look at the price of fuel for trucks
[2:54:54.200 --> 2:54:58.520]  that is essentially a byproduct product it's waste
[2:54:58.520 --> 2:55:01.560]  no we know you know all the angles this amazing and closing
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:07.240]  what do you expect to happen uh under all this malfeasance
[2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:11.560]  well we're gonna have a big hole we're gonna have to climb out of and i hope
[2:55:11.560 --> 2:55:16.360]  it isn't a bottomless rabbit hole and we wind up like great britain
[2:55:16.360 --> 2:55:20.440]  a secondary power with the people's republic of china lording it over
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:25.400]  everybody's so that's the danger they have cut too
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:29.480]  much off they are destroying manhood they're destroying
[2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:33.240]  education they're pricing everything out of reach
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.640]  they have engendered deliberate inflation and i say that on purpose
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:43.720]  because that helps out the financial market the investment market because it
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:49.480]  reduces existing loan loads and debt obligations
[2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:53.080]  and we've got a bunch of creeps in there that are more
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:57.080]  interested in who gets to play girl than they are
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:56:02.040]  in the effectiveness to deal with the other 97 percent of the american
[2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:07.320]  population so we've reached a re-entry on that moment of leptomy k
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:11.160]  what do you see happening with the midterms in the election
[2:56:11.160 --> 2:56:15.240]  i think that the democratic party is going to get slaughtered
[2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:20.760]  every time for the last half century when one party's
[2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:26.520]  percentages of support drop is low below a certain point
[2:56:26.520 --> 2:56:32.200]  that party always loses control of whatever chamber of congress it controls
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:37.560]  and biden's are the worst ever and interestingly enough
[2:56:37.560 --> 2:56:41.560]  his would-be replacement camilla emhoff
[2:56:41.560 --> 2:56:47.400]  well harris him off hers are the absolute worst ever
[2:56:47.400 --> 2:56:53.320]  firu agnew who wound up doing time in state and federal penitentiaries
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:58.760]  when he was vice president to tricky dick nixon even after he resigned because
[2:56:58.760 --> 2:57:02.520]  of criminal charges pending his ratings are better than
[2:57:02.520 --> 2:57:08.120]  camilla harris him off so this is a complete disaster
[2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:11.640]  we've got two incompetent sitting up there
[2:57:11.640 --> 2:57:16.440]  in line one's already in office and he can't even remember where the hell he
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:21.880]  is let alone what's going on and camilla harris has always been
[2:57:21.880 --> 2:57:26.360]  lazy she wants to show so you're right judge joe brown amazing at judge joe
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:28.920]  brown tv on twitter the judge joe brown show
[2:57:28.920 --> 2:57:32.120]  dot com we got your great barbecue sauce at four store dot com thanks for

[2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:45.960]  watch and stay with us
[2:57:47.160 --> 2:57:52.600]  the internet and talk radio are on fire with the slogan alec shones was right
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:55.960]  people ask what's it like to be vindicated well it's actually very sick
[2:57:55.960 --> 2:58:00.120]  feeling because i knew this was coming i tried to stop it
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:03.480]  and now everything i've talked about is going to become
[2:58:03.480 --> 2:58:07.800]  more important than ever because the globalist aren't hiding anymore
[2:58:07.800 --> 2:58:11.320]  in policy reports and documents it's now
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:16.040]  out in the open claus wab said last week that they rule the earth
[2:58:16.040 --> 2:58:19.880]  the bill der berg group founded davos group so now
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:23.640]  the fight's out in the open they're making their move because they know
[2:58:23.640 --> 2:58:26.600]  they're behind schedule we're going to win this thing god's watching the

[2:59:44.760 --> 2:59:51.480]  to get two thousand mules today leading a frontal assault on the lies
[2:59:51.480 --> 3:00:15.240]  of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:00:15.240 --> 3:00:21.720]  transmuting world wide from the summit.new studios in the united kingdom
[3:00:21.720 --> 3:00:27.640]  you are listening to paul joseph watson
[3:00:27.640 --> 3:00:33.640]  it's friday it is the 24th of june it is 2022 and it is a momentous day history
[3:00:33.640 --> 3:00:37.320]  of america the supreme court ruling of course has
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:42.440]  over row v wade and suffice to say hoes mad
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:45.640]  hoes big mad we're going to get into that and a whole lot more
[3:00:45.640 --> 3:00:49.800]  over the course of the next hour maxine waters is saying to hell with the
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:54.920]  supreme court we will defy them the same people who said january 6 was a
[3:00:54.920 --> 3:00:58.680]  disgraceful attack on the very bedrock of american democracy
[3:00:58.680 --> 3:01:02.280]  they're now calling for supreme court rulings to be ignored
[3:01:02.280 --> 3:01:05.480]  and for the supreme court to be abolished entirely
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:10.680]  because they really believe in democracy aoc got out in front of the supreme
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:14.600]  court within an hour of the ruling being made public
[3:01:14.600 --> 3:01:19.240]  and called the supreme court illegitimate meanwhile the big question
[3:01:19.240 --> 3:01:24.280]  continues to be asked when will the riots begin of course
[3:01:24.280 --> 3:01:27.800]  twitter is awash with leftist threatening riots
[3:01:27.800 --> 3:01:32.200]  threatening to burn down the supreme court threatening to assassinate supreme
[3:01:32.200 --> 3:01:37.160]  court justices that's all going on right now as we speak
[3:01:37.160 --> 3:01:42.200]  will it be as bad as summer 2020 blm and t for riots a lot of people don't think
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:46.760]  so because they say the democratic party apparatus now has
[3:01:46.760 --> 3:01:50.760]  control basically whim over whether those groups stage riots
[3:01:50.760 --> 3:01:54.200]  given that they're openly inciting violence doing exactly what they
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:57.960]  falsely claim donald trump did before january 6
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:01.240]  i see riots happening tonight i don't think it's going to be anywhere near
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:05.880]  as sustained or as deadly as the billions of dollars in property damage
[3:02:05.880 --> 3:02:09.240]  dozens of people who died during the 2020 blm riots
[3:02:09.240 --> 3:02:12.600]  but you're definitely going to see massive unrest
[3:02:12.600 --> 3:02:16.120]  at least over the course of the next two nights
[3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:20.120]  again people have made the point the biggest see this coming from middle
[3:02:20.120 --> 3:02:22.840]  class white women so it's not going to be quite as
[3:02:22.840 --> 3:02:26.360]  vitriolic as the blm and t for riots but i think we will see
[3:02:26.360 --> 3:02:30.200]  massive unrest tonight given that democratic operatives
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:34.840]  are openly now calling for that because we have the dhs warning pro-life
[3:02:34.840 --> 3:02:39.480]  organizations churches and other institutions across the country of
[3:02:39.480 --> 3:02:43.560]  this coming night of rage these far-left groups
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:46.760]  james revenge have called for this have banned it
[3:02:46.760 --> 3:02:52.200]  and let's not forget a guy openly planned to assassinate justice cabanar
[3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:55.800]  didn't go through with it we've had these not cases hanging outside
[3:02:55.800 --> 3:03:01.960]  supreme court justices homes we've had attacks already in the past few weeks on
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:07.160]  pro-life institutions on churches fires so of course you're going to see more of
[3:03:07.160 --> 3:03:10.360]  that tonight later on in the show i'm going to play
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:15.000]  a reminder of how an abortion is actually performed a lot of people still
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:19.000]  can't seem to grasp the absolute barbarity that goes on
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:24.440]  with these 690 000 is it abortions in america every single year that's the
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:28.040]  official number the people who don't relate that they had an abortion means
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:32.120]  it's probably far higher also going to get into the
[3:03:32.120 --> 3:03:35.640]  pennsylvania drag queen who was arrested and charged with possessing
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:40.200]  child pornography many such cases the new york times is worried that
[3:03:40.200 --> 3:03:44.200]  big tech won't censor hard enough during the mid term elections they're
[3:03:44.200 --> 3:03:48.680]  calling for twitter and meta facebook to step up
[3:03:48.680 --> 3:03:52.360]  biden was given a cheat sheet of course which instructed him how to say
[3:03:52.360 --> 3:03:55.800]  hello how to sit down how to interact with other people
[3:03:55.800 --> 3:03:58.280]  basically the kind of thing you would give to a
[3:03:58.280 --> 3:04:03.160]  autistic high school teenager before doing a presentation that's now how
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:07.560]  dementia ridden the president of the united states is apparently
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:11.080]  meanwhile left-wing newspaper the guardian is encouraging its readers to
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:15.800]  save their yore into humiliate vladimir putin yes that's a real headline
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:19.720]  ukraine has banned its main opposition party and seized all its assets because
[3:04:19.720 --> 3:04:23.400]  it's a beacon of democracy only 11 percent believe biden
[3:04:23.400 --> 3:04:26.440]  narrative that putin is to blame for record gas prices
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:31.160]  that narrative has completely collapsed then in the third segment we're going to
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:34.600]  tell you about again another massive underreported story that should have
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:38.120]  been worldwide headlines and that is what happened in the towns
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:41.800]  around late garter italy at the beginning of the month
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:47.720]  where migrant stage robbings assault smashed up shops it was a day of war as
[3:04:47.720 --> 3:04:51.400]  the local politicians called it we'll be back with that and more in the next
[3:04:51.400 --> 3:04:54.680]  segment summit don't use them go
[3:05:02.280 --> 3:05:06.280]  i want to say brain force is great i want to say turbo force is amazing it is
[3:05:06.280 --> 3:05:11.720]  but if you took it with bish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil
[3:05:11.720 --> 3:05:15.480]  is better than that and that's an example of what i'm talking about fish oil is
[3:05:15.480 --> 3:05:19.960]  liquid energy brain body heart the cleanest the best out there
[3:05:19.960 --> 3:05:23.160]  krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and i'm just
[3:05:23.160 --> 3:05:25.000]  sorry you want something like this you don't get
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:28.680]  stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's so good in my view
[3:05:28.680 --> 3:05:31.720]  i'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something i eat five
[3:05:31.720 --> 3:05:34.360]  caplets of krill oil before i go to bed i'm seeing
[3:05:34.360 --> 3:05:39.640]  sanic laws that night so your brain is made
[3:05:39.640 --> 3:05:43.880]  basically out of what fish oil is
[3:05:44.680 --> 3:05:47.880]  so we don't make a big profit off of it but you notice i just obsessed because
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:51.880]  whatever the best is we've got i just can't lie to you i just can't do it
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:55.720]  you're a sore
[3:06:04.920 --> 3:06:13.720]  live from the summit dot news headquarters it's paul joseph watson
[3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:17.720]  well you have to give credit to the supreme court justices for standing
[3:06:17.720 --> 3:06:21.800]  by their opinion which was of course leaked a few weeks ago
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:25.480]  of course we had the open assassination attempts against the
[3:06:25.480 --> 3:06:29.880]  brett cavanaugh a few weeks back we've had these notters stood outside their
[3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:32.600]  homes they're harassing them they're harassing their neighbors
[3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:37.960]  the democratic party control groups the institution of the democratic party
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:42.440]  it's far left ideologues have called on people to get in people's faces to
[3:06:42.440 --> 3:06:47.480]  confront them on the street to escalate this violent rhetoric
[3:06:47.480 --> 3:06:51.400]  now in response to the supreme court ruling of course there is
[3:06:51.400 --> 3:06:55.480]  liberal sieve and rage swamping twitter
[3:06:55.480 --> 3:06:59.320]  libs of tiktok posted a tweet from a woman who said quote
[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:03.880]  we need to burn it all down light it on fire unhinged pro abortion activist
[3:07:03.880 --> 3:07:07.720]  openly calls for violence against supreme court justices
[3:07:07.720 --> 3:07:12.520]  another far leftist on twitter said quote every member of the supreme court
[3:07:12.520 --> 3:07:15.080]  who just allowed roe v way to be overturned should be
[3:07:15.080 --> 3:07:19.560]  pulled out of their chambers and shot in the effing street
[3:07:19.560 --> 3:07:24.440]  this isn't hyper but hyperbole gun the m m f s down they failed as they failed
[3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:27.320]  every woman we know this is the kind of rhetoric
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:32.680]  swamping twitter as we speak burn down the supreme court if you search for
[3:07:32.680 --> 3:07:38.040]  that on twitter hundreds if not thousands of people calling for that
[3:07:38.040 --> 3:07:41.400]  cameron caskey from his verified twitter account
[3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:45.480]  said quote go to the home of every supreme court justice who just voted to
[3:07:45.480 --> 3:07:49.400]  kill women let them know how you feel
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:53.800]  we've also got of course the reaction from overseas everyone sticking their
[3:07:53.800 --> 3:07:57.800]  oren including canadian prime minister justin trudeau
[3:07:57.800 --> 3:08:02.040]  who said quote no government politician or man should tell a woman what's a
[3:08:02.040 --> 3:08:06.200]  woman they don't know what she can and cannot do with a body
[3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:09.640]  that's exactly what he did with the vaccine of course he openly said you
[3:08:09.640 --> 3:08:13.720]  shouldn't be able to get on a plane or a train without the government telling
[3:08:13.720 --> 3:08:17.320]  you what you can do with your body suddenly it's changed again it's flipped
[3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:21.160]  right back mike cernovich tweeted my sense
[3:08:21.160 --> 3:08:24.680]  is the shit lived will be less likely to flee the states they
[3:08:24.680 --> 3:08:30.200]  destroyed for red ones which will be spared them overall good yes the influx
[3:08:30.200 --> 3:08:33.960]  of leftists into red states like texas maybe that
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:38.760]  will now come to an end robbie rose tweeted if children can be
[3:08:38.760 --> 3:08:43.480]  expected to wear face masks 16 hours a day surely some guys can wear a condom
[3:08:43.480 --> 3:08:49.800]  for three minutes yes apparently not but maxine waters has responded by
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:53.320]  saying quote to hell with the supreme court we will defy them these were
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:57.640]  comments she made basically an hour after the ruling was made public
[3:08:57.640 --> 3:09:00.680]  she said they ain't seen nothing yet women are going to control their bodies no
[3:09:00.680 --> 3:09:04.520]  matter how they try to stop them of course the justice department has come
[3:09:04.520 --> 3:09:08.040]  out and said they'll do everything to basically try and overturn the supreme
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:11.400]  court democrats in congress in the senate are
[3:09:11.400 --> 3:09:14.280]  going to try and pass laws that override this again
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:18.680]  they're big fans of democracy until a decision is made which they don't like
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:21.960]  now they're calling for the supreme court to be abolished
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:28.040]  and in the words of aoc to be ignored she's calling it illegitimate aoc
[3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:32.600]  protests against abortion ban she wasted a little time in showing
[3:09:32.600 --> 3:09:35.240]  up outside the supreme court joining rowdy
[3:09:35.240 --> 3:09:39.320]  demonstrators to scream about it being illegitimate and demanding people get
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:42.920]  into the streets of course this is all in the context of the
[3:09:42.920 --> 3:09:47.720]  department of homeland security headline out of zero hedge dhs communicates
[3:09:47.720 --> 3:09:50.840]  specific threats facing pro-life orgs churches
[3:09:50.840 --> 3:09:56.600]  as they brace for knights of rage dhs has come out this was yesterday that they
[3:09:56.600 --> 3:10:00.520]  gave this warning of course aware that the ruling was coming down today
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:04.440]  communicating specific threats to pro-life groups and catholic leaders after
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:07.880]  suspicious individuals and groups have in some instances been found
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:12.600]  casing the offices and buildings of pro-life organizations of course
[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:17.000]  firebombing them in some instances now they're warning of a night of rage
[3:10:17.000 --> 3:10:20.200]  targeting churches and pregnancy centers in
[3:10:20.200 --> 3:10:25.160]  this backlash labeled as an urgent memo the document is from the diocese of
[3:10:25.160 --> 3:10:29.400]  stockton california directed to all clergy as well as parish and
[3:10:29.400 --> 3:10:33.400]  pastoral staff it says extremist groups are calling
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:10:37.400]  for attacks on churches beginning at 8 p.m the evening the court
[3:10:37.400 --> 3:10:43.400]  issues its opinion which is again only in a few hours time
[3:10:43.400 --> 3:10:47.160]  some national pro-life organizations report this week they've been contacted
[3:10:47.160 --> 3:10:51.240]  by the feds warning them to take steps amid threats of extreme
[3:10:51.240 --> 3:10:54.680]  violence feds are going to congregations to pastors
[3:10:54.680 --> 3:10:58.280]  and saying if there's anyone within law enforcement within your
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:02.280]  congregation put them on alert for this
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:05.640]  backlash the night of rage of course we had this as well
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:10.600]  night of rage flyers spotted in dc ahead of roe v wade decision
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:13.880]  it says any day now likely thursday of course it was today the supreme court
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:18.280]  could publish its final decision national reviews remesh panoro
[3:11:18.280 --> 3:11:21.320]  tweeted a picture of a flyer slapped on the side of what appears to be a
[3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:25.560]  concrete base of a light pole on the side of a street in dc the flyer reads
[3:11:25.560 --> 3:11:31.400]  dc called to action night of rage the night scotis overturns roe v wade
[3:11:31.400 --> 3:11:37.640]  hit the streets you should riot posting these flyers all over dc of
[3:11:37.640 --> 3:11:41.080]  course we had the pro-abortion group janes revenge
[3:11:41.080 --> 3:11:46.600]  signing the flyer recently declaring open season on pro-life groups and crisis
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:49.960]  pregnancy centers they've already damaged property
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:53.880]  and tifa groups have already fire bombed other facilities
[3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:58.600]  we had the bret cavanaugh assassination attempt which was stopped at the last
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:12:02.760]  minute the guy seemingly backed out so again
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:06.280]  will there be massive riots tonight how will it
[3:12:06.280 --> 3:12:10.360]  scale up in comparison to what we saw over the summer of 2020
[3:12:10.360 --> 3:12:15.320]  and how will the media report it will it be reported as mostly peaceful
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:19.240]  demonstrations once again as i said in the first
[3:12:19.240 --> 3:12:22.280]  segment the consensus seems to be that because biden's in
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:26.600]  office they're gonna hold back the reins on these violent protest groups and
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:31.320]  tifa blm pro-abortion groups i don't think they have that level
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:35.160]  of control over them and you wed that to the violent rhetoric the
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:38.760]  escalation that's now coming out from the likes of vaccine waters
[3:12:38.760 --> 3:12:42.840]  from the likes of aoc and it basically creates an environment
[3:12:42.840 --> 3:12:46.440]  where they've been given free rein two-stage massive
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:50.280]  civil unrest of course you had the videos earlier of the riot cops
[3:12:50.280 --> 3:12:54.840]  already moving in to dc so yeah i think you will see unrest
[3:12:54.840 --> 3:12:59.080]  on quite a large scale tonight and saturday i don't think it will be as
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:02.920]  sustained as the summer 2020 riots which of course were
[3:13:02.920 --> 3:13:07.640]  purposefully sustained and dragged over several months if not six months or
[3:13:07.640 --> 3:13:10.680]  more to create that kind of environment to
[3:13:10.680 --> 3:13:14.440]  unseat trump to make him look illegitimate
[3:13:14.440 --> 3:13:17.640]  maybe people are suggesting they're not gonna try and pull the same stunt with
[3:13:17.640 --> 3:13:21.800]  biden in office but given how insanely crazy these
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:26.120]  protest groups have acted in the past and given this escalation of rhetoric
[3:13:26.120 --> 3:13:30.920]  i think you will see at least some violent unrest tonight
[3:13:30.920 --> 3:13:34.280]  meanwhile pennsylvania drag queen arrested and charged with possessing
[3:13:34.280 --> 3:13:40.360]  child pornography many such cases this was a two year long
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:44.440]  investigation where the officers involved the special
[3:13:44.440 --> 3:13:47.720]  agents found that this individual brice patrick
[3:13:47.720 --> 3:13:52.840]  williams was uploading obscene horrific images of children engaged in sexual
[3:13:52.840 --> 3:13:58.440]  acts to a dropbox back in may 2020 they wanted to build up the evidence they
[3:13:58.440 --> 3:14:02.360]  wanted to nail this case without this individual being able to
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:06.440]  snake out of it they issued a subpoena to con cast for the ip
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:10.360]  information of the suspect found the location and then
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:13.800]  watched as over the following months they continued
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:18.120]  to upload more and more obscene images to this dropbox account
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:22.360]  they got the warrant to search the home of this individual
[3:14:22.360 --> 3:14:27.320]  who turns out to be a drag queen performer who has been lionized by the
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:31.080]  media as this great social worker in fact
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:35.400]  local newspapers touted him as quote an hiv aids prevention advocate
[3:14:35.400 --> 3:14:39.560]  and community organizer again this sick individual
[3:14:39.560 --> 3:14:43.720]  who basically admitted to the child porn after he was forced to hand over his
[3:14:43.720 --> 3:14:47.240]  phone and it was on his phone as well in the presence of the special
[3:14:47.240 --> 3:14:51.160]  agents raiding his home now admitted to having that
[3:14:51.160 --> 3:14:55.160]  of course we've had previous cases the former head of the cream city foundation
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:58.600]  which sponsors drag queen story hour in milwaukee
[3:14:58.600 --> 3:15:02.520]  was arrested on charges of possessing child pornography
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:06.920]  2019 we report at houston public library allowed a registered sex offender to
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:10.360]  read to children as part of drag queen story hour
[3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:14.680]  and of course one of those events was attended by alberto gaza convicted of
[3:15:14.680 --> 3:15:18.200]  sexually assaulting an eight-year-old boy in 2008
[3:15:18.200 --> 3:15:23.000]  long litany of cases where these drag queens or transvestite strippers as they
[3:15:23.000 --> 3:15:26.840]  should be called are connected to these drag queen story hours
[3:15:26.840 --> 3:15:31.720]  they're reading to kids predators use these kind of excuses to get around kids
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:35.960]  a week ago we had the pride marches where they were exposed to bare breasts
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:39.960]  fetishers half naked men whipping each other on the street
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:44.280]  kids should not be around this bottom line drag queen performances should not be
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:47.880]  anywhere around kids because these nonces use it as an excuse
[3:15:47.880 --> 3:15:52.280]  to be predatory to get close to them and this one thankfully has been snared
[3:15:52.280 --> 3:15:55.480]  we'll be back some it don't use
[3:15:59.480 --> 3:16:03.240]  granny do right granny do right thanks for holding her on the air go ahead

[3:16:08.040 --> 3:16:10.760]  for all the senior citizens out there that may have
[3:16:10.760 --> 3:16:15.480]  spent a lifetime in the sun like me i was loaded up with sunspots or age spots
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:19.720]  as they're lovingly called but since taking your x2 for the last couple of
[3:16:19.720 --> 3:16:23.240]  years my skin is just really gorgeous actually people
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:27.960]  think i'm 55 years old and i was already taking your other
[3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:31.880]  supplements but i thought you know well maybe that's what i need to do because
[3:16:31.880 --> 3:16:35.480]  i just thought it was a hopeless situation but when i started taking it
[3:16:35.480 --> 3:16:39.400]  to me it doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time
[3:16:39.400 --> 3:16:43.960]  i started noticing okay you know this is the ticket this is working this is
[3:16:43.960 --> 3:16:47.320]  wonderful you know i don't i don't have to put on
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:51.640]  derma blend anymore you know so anyway it worked wonderfully and it
[3:16:51.640 --> 3:16:55.320]  really has totally cleared up my skin
[3:16:55.320 --> 3:16:59.000]  the globalists are making their move their great reset is here

[3:18:09.400 --> 3:18:12.280]  the fish oil is better than that and that's an example of what i'm talking

[3:19:51.320 --> 3:19:53.160]  things you can do is get ahead of inflation
[3:19:53.160 --> 3:19:56.680]  now because the inflation is just beginning.
[3:19:57.320 --> 3:20:01.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order
[3:20:01.880 --> 3:20:06.680]  it's alex jones.
[3:20:06.680 --> 3:20:17.640]  Broadcasting internationally from the summit.news headquarters in the United Kingdom
[3:20:17.640 --> 3:20:22.600]  it's paul joseph watson.
[3:20:23.000 --> 3:20:27.080]  Now of course with this ruling we have the massive seed the massive coat from
[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:31.320]  laxness the threats of riots we also have a complete ignorance and lack of
[3:20:31.320 --> 3:20:35.000]  understanding continually of what an abortion procedure
[3:20:35.000 --> 3:20:38.760]  especially in the second trimester actually involves
[3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:43.400]  i've got family members who've worked in hospitals friends who worked in hospitals
[3:20:43.400 --> 3:20:48.600]  all of whom used to be leftists on the issue used to be pro-choice
[3:20:48.600 --> 3:20:53.400]  and support the right to kill babies you'll find quite often that once they
[3:20:53.400 --> 3:20:57.320]  are exposed to this not directly but indirectly knowing what goes on in
[3:20:57.320 --> 3:21:00.360]  terms of abortions especially second trimester
[3:21:00.360 --> 3:21:03.720]  there's massive ignorance out there in terms of
[3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:08.200]  what do people think they do when they vacuum out these babies
[3:21:08.200 --> 3:21:11.560]  when they go in with forceps and literally pull them
[3:21:11.560 --> 3:21:15.800]  limb from limb like how did you think these babies were being killed
[3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:19.000]  gently put to sleep like you would an old dog
[3:21:19.000 --> 3:21:23.800]  it's absolutely barbaric and horrific and there was a video that came out last
[3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:29.080]  year from life site news powerful video showing how second
[3:21:29.080 --> 3:21:33.000]  trimester abortions are performed they show the people on the streets they
[3:21:33.000 --> 3:21:37.160]  all say yes i'm pro-choice blah blah blah as soon as they see
[3:21:37.160 --> 3:21:40.920]  how they didn't know in the first place people just got a basic superficial
[3:21:40.920 --> 3:21:44.120]  level of thinking and no critical thinking skills they don't even think
[3:21:44.120 --> 3:21:48.920]  beyond the first thought how it's done how this procedure
[3:21:48.920 --> 3:21:52.440]  this barbaric gruesome procedure is enacted
[3:21:52.440 --> 3:21:57.160]  and how it's now being used as a form of contraception a form of birth control
[3:21:57.160 --> 3:22:01.160]  with women using it again just killing babies because they think it's a
[3:22:01.160 --> 3:22:05.400]  straightforward procedure again cancers involved with
[3:22:05.400 --> 3:22:09.480]  women who have abortions through the roof their inability to get pregnant
[3:22:09.480 --> 3:22:13.480]  again after having an abortion significantly higher
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:18.040]  the body rebels against this horrific abnormal procedure
[3:22:18.040 --> 3:22:21.720]  and again this is how this is what underscores a society
[3:22:21.720 --> 3:22:26.440]  based on treating its own progeny like medical waste this is how we all go to
[3:22:26.440 --> 3:22:31.480]  hell in a hand basket very quickly indeed but let's go to this video
[3:22:31.480 --> 3:22:35.480]  these people were pro-choice until they watched this video of an actual abortion
[3:22:35.480 --> 3:22:39.560]  and it's not an actual abortion by the way it's a cartoon graphic of what they
[3:22:39.560 --> 3:22:44.680]  do but here is the clip let's roll it
[3:22:44.680 --> 3:22:59.640]  what are your thoughts about abortion i think that um the women should have the
[3:22:59.640 --> 3:23:05.000]  right to choose what they do with their bodies i have to second that 110 percent
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.760]  i'm pro-abortion people should have the choice if they're not ready
[3:23:08.760 --> 3:23:12.760]  would you both support abortion all the way up to the moment of birth
[3:23:12.760 --> 3:23:16.280]  oh yeah i do i do yes i have nothing against it
[3:23:16.280 --> 3:23:20.520]  and i think you know it's a right and a choice for people to exercise it
[3:23:20.520 --> 3:23:24.120]  i personally wouldn't do it but like i wouldn't restrict anyone pro-choice
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:29.000]  for sure
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.960]  in one word can you describe your thoughts on what you saw
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:36.520]  disturbing barbaric yeah it's a form of like just
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:40.120]  taking life and just throw it in the trash that's just
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:43.240]  that's too much for me i have children no i i don't think
[3:23:43.240 --> 3:23:48.520]  any kid any baby any infant i mean um you know any fetus should go through that
[3:23:48.520 --> 3:23:52.840]  no that's not okay that's not okay um i
[3:23:52.840 --> 3:23:56.840]  that changes my opinion the videos that i that you guys show me has
[3:23:56.840 --> 3:24:01.640]  changed my mind seeing that was like really sad
[3:24:01.640 --> 3:24:11.640]  my name is dr anthony levitino i'm a practicing obstetrician
[3:24:11.640 --> 3:24:15.240]  gynecologist and i've performed over 1200 abortions
[3:24:15.240 --> 3:24:18.760]  today i'm going to describe a second trimester surgical abortion called
[3:24:18.760 --> 3:24:24.280]  dilatation and evacuation or dne a dne is performed between 13 and 24 weeks of
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:28.280]  pregnancy after administering anesthesia the
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:32.520]  abortionist uses a weighted speculum like this one that opens the vagina
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:36.120]  widely because second trimester babies are so
[3:24:36.120 --> 3:24:40.440]  large this greater access facilitates a late term abortion
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:45.160]  late term abortion requires that the cervix be prepared 24 to 48 hours in
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:48.840]  advance with laminaria laminaria is a type of sterilized
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:53.480]  seaweed that absorbs water over 8 to 12 hours and swells to several times its
[3:24:53.480 --> 3:24:57.320]  original diameter once removed metal dilators can be
[3:24:57.320 --> 3:25:00.440]  used to further open the cervix as needed
[3:25:00.440 --> 3:25:03.960]  once the cervix has been stretched open the suction tube is placed
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:09.480]  inside a baby at 20 weeks gestation is as big as the length of my hand
[3:25:09.480 --> 3:25:14.440]  from head to rump not counting the legs the suction machine is turned on
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:18.120]  and pale yellow amniotic fluid surrounding the baby is suctioned out
[3:25:18.120 --> 3:25:21.800]  through the catheters the babies this big they don't fit through
[3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:25.400]  catheters this size the baby's bones and skull are too
[3:25:25.400 --> 3:25:28.520]  strong to be torn apart by suction alone
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:32.680]  this is a sofa clamp a sofa clamp is made of stainless steel
[3:25:32.680 --> 3:25:36.200]  it's about 13 inches long the business end is about
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:39.560]  two and a half inches long and a half inch wide and there are rows of sharp
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:42.760]  teeth this is a grasping instrument when it
[3:25:42.760 --> 3:25:45.880]  gets a hold of something it does not let go
[3:25:45.880 --> 3:25:50.840]  the abortionist uses this clamp to grasp an arm or leg
[3:25:50.840 --> 3:25:53.720]  once he has a firm grip the abortionist pulls
[3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:57.640]  hard in order to tear the limb from the baby's body
[3:25:57.640 --> 3:26:00.440]  one by one the rest of the limbs are removed
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:05.640]  along with the intestines the spine and the heart and lungs
[3:26:05.640 --> 3:26:09.560]  usually the most difficult part of the procedure is extracting the baby's head
[3:26:09.560 --> 3:26:13.160]  which is about the size of a large plum at 20 weeks
[3:26:13.160 --> 3:26:17.560]  the head is grasped and crushed the abortionist knows he has crushed the
[3:26:17.560 --> 3:26:20.760]  skull when a white substance comes out of the cervix
[3:26:20.760 --> 3:26:26.200]  this was the baby's brains the abortionist then removes skull pieces
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:31.000]  he removes the placenta and any leftover parts of the baby with a curette
[3:26:31.000 --> 3:26:35.800]  scraping the lining of the uterus for any remaining tissue
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:39.720]  the abortionist then collects the baby parts and reassembles them
[3:26:39.720 --> 3:26:43.800]  to make sure that there are two arms two legs and all the pieces
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:47.320]  once all the parts have been accounted for the abortion is complete
[3:26:47.320 --> 3:26:51.240]  for the woman this procedure carries a significant risk
[3:26:51.240 --> 3:26:55.320]  of major complications including perforation or laceration of the
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:58.760]  uterus or cervix with possible damage to the bowel
[3:26:58.760 --> 3:27:03.320]  bladder and other maternal organs infection and hemorrhage can also occur
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:07.800]  which can even lead to death future pregnancies are also at greater risk
[3:27:07.800 --> 3:27:12.200]  for loss or premature delivery due to abortion related trauma and
[3:27:12.200 --> 3:27:15.000]  injury to the cervix as i mentioned at the beginning
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:19.560]  i'm dr anthony levitino and in the early part of my career as an obgyn i
[3:27:19.560 --> 3:27:24.520]  performed over 1200 abortions one day after completing one of those
[3:27:24.520 --> 3:27:27.480]  abortions i looked at the remains of a preborn
[3:27:27.480 --> 3:27:31.240]  child whose life i had ended and all i could see with someone's son or
[3:27:31.240 --> 3:27:34.280]  daughter i came to realize that killing a baby at
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:37.400]  any stage of pregnancy for any reason is wrong
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:41.320]  i want you to know today no matter where you're at or what you've done
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:45.800]  you can change make a decision today to protect the preborn
[3:27:45.800 --> 3:27:48.760]  thank you for your time
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:52.520]  there you have it hope you weren't eating your lunch while that was on
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:55.560]  let's go through these stats quickly in the final minute though stats from the
[3:27:55.560 --> 3:27:58.360]  gut marker institute because again the argument is always what about rape
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:01.320]  what about incest here are the percentage of incest
[3:28:01.320 --> 3:28:05.080]  rape etc that resulted from that resulted in an
[3:28:05.080 --> 3:28:07.960]  abortion pregnancy resulted from an incestuous
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:11.640]  relationship 0.01 percent of abortions
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:15.800]  woman's life was endangered by the pregnancy 0.65 percent
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:20.200]  the woman was raped 0.85 percent women's physical health was threatened by
[3:28:20.200 --> 3:28:24.280]  the pregnancy 0.2 percent six uh the woman
[3:28:24.280 --> 3:28:28.680]  aborted for the baby is aborted for social or economic reasons that's 6.2
[3:28:28.680 --> 3:28:32.840]  percent of abortions and then no reason given for abortions
[3:28:32.840 --> 3:28:37.320]  in america is 92.3 percent so you add that up
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:41.320]  almost 99 percent of cases of abortion
[3:28:41.320 --> 3:28:45.640]  are for social or economic reasons or simply elected
[3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:49.480]  the woman chose to because it was presumably an inconvenience so again
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:55.000]  that is defeated that narrative we'll be back some of the news don't go away
[3:28:55.640 --> 3:29:02.280]  at this point best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all and if
[3:29:02.280 --> 3:29:06.280]  we don't turn it around soon then it will only get worse
[3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:09.400]  but as bad as things are we still have time
[3:29:09.400 --> 3:29:13.640]  to prepare and that alone is something to be grateful for

[3:33:35.240 --> 3:33:39.400]  now every time i host a show each week i say there's a massive story which has
[3:33:39.400 --> 3:33:43.000]  been completely buried or ignored by the mainstream media which should
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:47.240]  be a top global headline we had it with the case of linton on who was the
[3:33:47.240 --> 3:33:50.760]  village which they were planning to dump 1500
[3:33:50.760 --> 3:33:55.720]  refugees migrants on a small village of just 700 residents
[3:33:55.720 --> 3:34:00.280]  that started to build once we gave it the coverage it deserved
[3:34:00.280 --> 3:34:04.040]  still an ongoing story that i'm going to talk about but another similar case
[3:34:04.040 --> 3:34:07.640]  happened in italy when a group of 2000 migrant youths
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:12.280]  descended on the towns around lake garter this is called it happened again
[3:34:12.280 --> 3:34:16.360]  and in this video you will once again see how much diversity is a strength let's
[3:34:16.360 --> 3:34:22.280]  roll the video
[3:34:22.280 --> 3:34:27.000]  well it happened again a major incident occurred recently which in previous
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:30.520]  years would have gone atop international headlines but because we've all
[3:34:30.520 --> 3:34:35.480]  been gently boiled like the frog in the proverbial pot this huge news story
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:39.480]  passed virtually unnoticed except in italy where it has caused
[3:34:39.480 --> 3:34:43.640]  significant distress and alarm and suffice to say when it comes to what
[3:34:43.640 --> 3:34:47.880]  happened many such cases on june 2nd around 2000
[3:34:47.880 --> 3:34:51.000]  migrant background youths predominantly north african
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:54.920]  besieged italyan towns around lake garter after traveling from the migrant
[3:34:54.920 --> 3:34:59.400]  suburbs of milan brashia and bogamo they arrived in pesquiera waving the flags
[3:34:59.400 --> 3:35:02.680]  of various african countries including morocco and
[3:35:02.680 --> 3:35:07.640]  shouted slogans such as we came to reconquer pesquiera this is our
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:12.680]  territory africa must come here
[3:35:12.680 --> 3:35:17.320]  they organized the event under the slogan africa in pesquiera
[3:35:17.320 --> 3:35:21.320]  note the language here this isn't just a boisterous beach party
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:25.080]  it was a deliberate act of cultural recolonization
[3:35:25.080 --> 3:35:29.560]  before long the mob exploded into lawlessness robbing tourists brawling
[3:35:29.560 --> 3:35:33.160]  with knives and sticks and ransacking local shops and businesses
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:36.120]  they destroyed everything said a business owner speaking with
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:40.280]  corriera de la sera they broke shop windows stormed the tourist train and
[3:35:40.280 --> 3:35:52.840]  blocked passes by on foot or by moped
[3:35:52.840 --> 3:35:56.120]  and riot police who showed up were immediately pelted with stones
[3:35:56.120 --> 3:36:00.120]  imagine that you're trying to enjoy a peaceful lakeside vacation and suddenly
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:16.280]  there are swarms of migrants fighting running battles with riot cops
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:20.280]  it's gonna ruin your holiday isn't it as in cologne and as in milan this past
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:24.200]  new year's eve we also saw numerous sexual assaults of women
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:27.480]  this in a country where government statistics show migrants are responsible
[3:36:27.480 --> 3:36:30.920]  for 42 percent of all rapes despite only representing
[3:36:30.920 --> 3:36:34.680]  eight percent of the population ten teenage girls were sexually assaulted
[3:36:34.680 --> 3:36:38.760]  on one train alone and six other girls also reported being molested
[3:36:38.760 --> 3:36:42.600]  we were surrounded the heat was suffocating and some of us fainted
[3:36:42.600 --> 3:36:46.760]  said one of the victims the groups of migrant men groping and molesting the
[3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:51.400]  girls told them directly quote why girls don't come here
[3:36:51.400 --> 3:36:56.360]  the mayor of pesquiera orietta gauli said quote they are just a race of criminals
[3:36:56.360 --> 3:37:01.560]  who have left a deep wound in my community we lived a day of war
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:05.240]  what's noteworthy about this havoc is that it occurred not in a segregated
[3:37:05.240 --> 3:37:09.400]  banlio or a migrant suburb but amidst the picturesque beauty of an
[3:37:09.400 --> 3:37:12.600]  upmarket tourist destination maybe some wealthy
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:17.240]  elitists got to experience diversity being a strength upfront for the very
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:23.160]  first time
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:27.880]  as mattio salvini emphasized these so-called baby gangs migrant youths age
[3:37:27.880 --> 3:37:32.040]  16 to 20 are allowed to run riot in italy because the age at which
[3:37:32.040 --> 3:37:36.920]  criminal responsibility applies isn't low enough salvini shared messages showing
[3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:39.560]  migrants planning a repeat performance with
[3:37:39.560 --> 3:37:42.840]  preparations for more rampant criminality circulating on
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:45.880]  tiktok pesquiera delgada was just a warm-up round
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:49.800]  said one post see you in riccione let's call it
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:55.960]  the summer of cultural enrichment
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:59.320]  turns out that this reconquest of pesquiera
[3:37:59.320 --> 3:38:04.120]  is an annual event and it's been growing every year first 200 then 500 now
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:08.120]  2000 involved and every year the unrest gets more
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:11.800]  violent what's even more alarming is that many of these baby gang
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:15.400]  teens with migrant parents will have been born in italy
[3:38:15.400 --> 3:38:21.000]  yeah these are the supposedly well-integrated ones
[3:38:29.000 --> 3:38:33.800]  luca zaya the governor of the veneto region reacted to the turmoil by asserting
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:38.280]  quote the idea must not pass that events like these can become ordinary or even
[3:38:38.280 --> 3:38:42.360]  worse that we can become accustomed to it and yet events like this have become
[3:38:42.360 --> 3:38:47.000]  totally commonplace in many european countries but not others like
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:50.520]  cungary and poland wonder why that is this all
[3:38:50.520 --> 3:38:54.840]  happened just days after similar scenes before the champions league final in
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:38:57.960]  paris where visiting supporters were terrorized
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:39:02.600]  robbed and assaulted by huge gangs of migrant youths from the sandini area
[3:39:02.600 --> 3:39:06.200]  which is home to 400 000 illegal immigrants
[3:39:06.200 --> 3:39:09.800]  again the vast majority from north africa and the middle east victims said
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:14.120]  of their attackers quote they found our fear amusing after
[3:39:14.120 --> 3:39:17.160]  initially trying to frame livable supporters for the chaos
[3:39:17.160 --> 3:39:21.640]  authorities vowed to conduct a full and proper investigation but then admitted
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:25.640]  that they had failed to perform the first basic function of any legal
[3:39:25.640 --> 3:39:30.120]  investigation by forgetting to ask for the security camera footage from around
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:33.400]  the stadium which is all now being conveniently
[3:39:33.400 --> 3:39:37.000]  deleted whoops another paris suburb was rocked by further
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:40.360]  unrest last week when gangs of afghan and turkish migrants were
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:44.520]  involved in large interethnic brawls on two separate occasions if flooding
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:48.840]  western countries with economic migrants and refugees is so enriching
[3:39:48.840 --> 3:39:52.360]  and such a net positive as leftists always claim why do
[3:39:52.360 --> 3:39:57.000]  autocrats like erdoğan and putin constantly threaten to use migrants as
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:00.440]  a weapon to destabilize european countries by
[3:40:00.440 --> 3:40:03.640]  facilitating their entry en masse to european countries
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:07.720]  are they doing as a favor because it doesn't feel like it for the first time
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:11.320]  ever over one million migrants will be eligible to vote in the swedish
[3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:14.920]  national elections and they ain't voting for populist or right wing parties
[3:40:14.920 --> 3:40:18.360]  like the sweden democrats the recent survey found that more than half of
[3:40:18.360 --> 3:40:23.960]  young people want to leave africa their number one destination europe
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:28.360]  you can't import such huge numbers of people from africa at such an
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:33.080]  accelerated speed and not expect it to radically change europe and the
[3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:35.400]  fact that people merely asking to have a frank
[3:40:35.400 --> 3:40:40.040]  conversation about what all that entails are being demonized as extremists
[3:40:40.040 --> 3:40:43.800]  is a not a disgrace there's more uproar generated by banners flown over
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:48.120]  football matches saying british to be a minority by 2066 than there is by
[3:40:48.120 --> 3:40:51.800]  hundreds upon hundreds of illegal boat migrants arriving in england every
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:55.160]  single day than there was after salman abadi a
[3:40:55.160 --> 3:40:59.800]  refugee rescued by our own royal navy being allowed to perpetrate the
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:04.040]  atrocity at the manchester arena because police and security guards
[3:41:04.040 --> 3:41:09.480]  refused to act on his suspicious behavior because they feared being called
[3:41:09.480 --> 3:41:12.200]  racist what happened in france and italy
[3:41:12.200 --> 3:41:15.720]  represents a dire warning to the residents of linton on ooze
[3:41:15.720 --> 3:41:19.960]  that's the tiny english village of just 700 residents that the government
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:25.000]  planned to dump 1500 migrants on to be housed at a nearby
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:29.160]  refugee center despite indicating that they may abandon the plan after
[3:41:29.160 --> 3:41:33.720]  local staged vociferous protests the government has been secretly planning
[3:41:33.720 --> 3:41:37.080]  to go ahead with it all anyway recruitment has already
[3:41:37.080 --> 3:41:42.040]  begun to staff the site with 400 employees and according to mp kevin
[3:41:42.040 --> 3:41:45.400]  holland rake facilities are also being moved on to the site
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:48.280]  the staff are being told that they must prepare to deal with
[3:41:48.280 --> 3:41:51.720]  suicide risks domestic violence situations
[3:41:51.720 --> 3:41:56.840]  violence and antisocial behavior and death up until now those things probably
[3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:00.360]  weren't a prominent feature of village life in linton on ooze
[3:42:00.360 --> 3:42:06.840]  1500 migrants in a village with just one shop a few buses that run a day
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:10.680]  and 700 residents what could possibly go wrong
[3:42:10.680 --> 3:42:14.200]  well given the examples of what happened in france and italy recently
[3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:17.880]  they may be about to receive a little more cultural enrichment
[3:42:17.880 --> 3:42:20.920]  than they bargained for
[3:42:20.920 --> 3:42:30.680]  now we're going to come back and talk about some more fallout from the linton

[3:47:07.880 --> 3:47:11.480]  you're listening to the summit.news radio hour
[3:47:11.480 --> 3:47:15.880]  with paul joseph watson
[3:47:16.520 --> 3:47:19.880]  i'm gonna go to another video here in a minute about
[3:47:19.880 --> 3:47:26.440]  refugee protesters pro-refugee protesters and how they answered a particular question
[3:47:26.440 --> 3:47:30.360]  during demonstrations over the course of the last week but you heard me mention it
[3:47:30.360 --> 3:47:35.240]  there in the previous video the besiege of lake god are these
[3:47:35.240 --> 3:47:41.080]  gang of 2000 youth migrants robbing people smashing up shops running riot
[3:47:41.080 --> 3:47:45.880]  basically again in a tranquil tourist destination not in a
[3:47:45.880 --> 3:47:50.440]  dangerous no-go zone suburb of course we have the situation in linton on news
[3:47:50.440 --> 3:47:54.200]  this is a small village of 700 people in north yorkshire england
[3:47:54.200 --> 3:47:58.280]  the government without any consultation suddenly announced that they were going to dump
[3:47:58.280 --> 3:48:03.640]  1500 migrants all of whom were young fighting age men by the way
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:07.240]  on this village of 700 residents with one shop
[3:48:07.240 --> 3:48:11.240]  and four buses that run through it a day completely
[3:48:11.240 --> 3:48:15.080]  altering the demographic makeup of the village of course the residents were
[3:48:15.080 --> 3:48:18.360]  outraged they protested they're still being
[3:48:18.360 --> 3:48:21.960]  stone walled by the government they're not telling them what's happening with
[3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:25.160]  this planet first it looked like they did backtracked and were
[3:48:25.160 --> 3:48:28.120]  about to drop it then it turned out that they were actually
[3:48:28.120 --> 3:48:31.720]  hiring 300 to 400 employees to work at this
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:36.680]  refugee facility and what would they be tasked with doing
[3:48:36.680 --> 3:48:41.240]  headline staff at refugee facility warned they will have to handle violence
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:45.960]  anti-social behavior and death
[3:48:46.040 --> 3:48:51.240]  this is the village linton on news again 700 permanent residents they plan to
[3:48:51.240 --> 3:48:55.960]  house 1500 asylum seekers there but the government has been putting out
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:49:00.040]  tenders contracts for applicants employees to work at this
[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:03.720]  facility three to four hundred using circo the outsourcing
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:07.960]  company used by the government and in this job advertisement on the website
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:11.720]  it said that staff would need to deal with quote urgent
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:16.360]  medical needs suicide risks domestic violent situations
[3:49:16.360 --> 3:49:20.200]  violence and anti-social behavior death and child
[3:49:20.200 --> 3:49:24.280]  safeguarding needs so again as i point out in the article
[3:49:24.280 --> 3:49:28.760]  death suicide violent anti-social behavior is probably
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:33.160]  a part of village life that the 700 residents of this sleepy village
[3:49:33.160 --> 3:49:38.360]  linton on news aren't quite familiar with but they will get to enjoy that kind
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:43.960]  of cultural enrichment if and when the government approves this plan
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:48.840]  let's go to this video now though because amidst all this protesting of the
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:52.680]  government's plan to deport migrants to rwanda which they basically failed to
[3:49:52.680 --> 3:49:56.600]  deport any because all these activist judges left-wing protesters and the
[3:49:56.600 --> 3:50:01.240]  european court of human rights stepped in and prevented them from doing so
[3:50:01.240 --> 3:50:04.840]  protesters at a refugee welcome rally in
[3:50:04.840 --> 3:50:08.360]  london were asked to consider housing a refugee
[3:50:08.360 --> 3:50:13.560]  and suffice to say they weren't very welcoming towards refugees let's roll
[3:50:13.560 --> 3:50:17.080]  the clip refugees welcome me i just noticed your
[3:50:17.080 --> 3:50:20.440]  placard said if you refugees welcome me i'm just wondering if you'd like to go
[3:50:20.440 --> 3:50:23.560]  down on a list saying you're willing to take the refugees into your home
[3:50:23.560 --> 3:50:26.280]  because uh but maybe not in my backyard
[3:50:26.280 --> 3:50:29.320]  simply actually adopt a refugee and take them into your home
[3:50:29.320 --> 3:50:33.880]  but if i had any space i would but yeah it wouldn't be a nice place to bring them
[3:50:33.880 --> 3:50:37.560]  because it's a bit overcrowded right so your home is too overcrowded to take
[3:50:37.560 --> 3:50:40.040]  them yet you think our country has all the room
[3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:44.440]  required is that why they're planning to house 1500 of them in a village of
[3:50:44.440 --> 3:50:48.680]  just 700 residents sounds a bit what's the word
[3:50:48.680 --> 3:50:54.040]  oh yeah crowded the uk is one of the most densely populated countries in europe
[3:50:54.040 --> 3:50:58.120]  the roads are clogged public transport is rammed and public services are
[3:50:58.120 --> 3:51:01.880]  stretched to breaking point how is that not overcrowded
[3:51:01.880 --> 3:51:05.560]  no i'm sorry i can't you can't take one i don't have i don't have i don't have
[3:51:05.560 --> 3:51:08.600]  i don't have a don't have the space yeah we don't have space either
[3:51:08.600 --> 3:51:12.840]  space to keep relentlessly building houses many of them on greenbelt sites
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:17.640]  who accommodate 300 000 net immigrants every single year
[3:51:17.640 --> 3:51:21.640]  we'll have a refugee stay at your house yeah i don't mind you're going to list
[3:51:21.640 --> 3:51:24.840]  i don't mind yeah i don't think give me the pink oh wait i can't because my house is
[3:51:24.840 --> 3:51:28.040]  only little small amazing that would you be willing to have a refugee in your
[3:51:28.040 --> 3:51:31.400]  home uh yes if i had room if you had room it's
[3:51:31.400 --> 3:51:34.280]  funny that do any of these protesters have a spare
[3:51:34.280 --> 3:51:37.400]  bedroom not a single one so it's up to refugee
[3:51:37.400 --> 3:51:40.680]  no thank you no thank you well at least you didn't try and pull the same excuse
[3:51:40.680 --> 3:51:44.920]  any reason i don't know what sort of refugee you're talking about
[3:51:44.920 --> 3:51:49.160]  what sort of refugee well according to government statistics nine out of ten
[3:51:49.160 --> 3:51:54.600]  arriving in boats are young males aged 18 to 39 so yeah that saw
[3:51:54.600 --> 3:51:58.600]  the culturally enriching so not helpless women and children despite the
[3:51:58.600 --> 3:52:02.120]  propaganda being doled out by the media and the government excuse me
[3:52:02.120 --> 3:52:05.000]  would you be willing to adopt a refugee into your home
[3:52:05.000 --> 3:52:09.400]  uh no no but they told me diversity is a string
[3:52:09.400 --> 3:52:13.320]  would you adopt a refugee into your home thank you no
[3:52:13.320 --> 3:52:17.000]  so long as that diversity stays well away from their neighborhood doctor
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:21.240]  refugee um i would be willing to yeah if i had
[3:52:21.240 --> 3:52:26.040]  the space if you had the space yeah so where should we put them then
[3:52:26.040 --> 3:52:31.320]  where should we put them yeah uh this is uh in 30 000 hotel rooms at an expense
[3:52:31.320 --> 3:52:34.520]  to the taxpayer of five million quid a day
[3:52:34.520 --> 3:52:38.600]  obviously what does racism mean to you it means
[3:52:38.600 --> 3:52:42.520]  not equality for um those who don't come belong here
[3:52:42.520 --> 3:52:49.240]  for those that don't belong here yeah amazing wow now i'm totally convinced
[3:52:49.240 --> 3:52:53.000]  now i want to go to this final video here in the final few minutes because we
[3:52:53.000 --> 3:52:56.440]  had a headline student kicked out of uk college for supporting
[3:52:56.440 --> 3:53:00.600]  deportation of illegal immigrants this was a 17 year old
[3:53:00.600 --> 3:53:04.600]  kicked out of burnley college refused to take up his second year
[3:53:04.600 --> 3:53:08.760]  basically because he tweeted support for the government's actual policy
[3:53:08.760 --> 3:53:12.840]  failure though it is of deporting illegal migrants to rwanda
[3:53:12.840 --> 3:53:16.360]  he is a 17 year old boy is basically being cancelled
[3:53:16.360 --> 3:53:21.480]  we get people being arrested to the tune of over 3000 a year for offensive
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:25.720]  tweets in the united kingdom but now the police have announced that they're no
[3:53:25.720 --> 3:53:28.680]  longer dispatching officers to respond to burglaries
[3:53:28.680 --> 3:53:33.560]  and are completely failing to solve any of them but they have plenty of resources
[3:53:33.560 --> 3:53:39.720]  to thought patrol your mean tweets this video is clown world police here it is
[3:53:39.720 --> 3:53:44.520]  the Daily Mail reports police have failed to solve a single burglary in nearly
[3:53:44.520 --> 3:53:47.400]  half of the country's neighborhoods over the past three years
[3:53:47.400 --> 3:53:52.280]  oh wow who could have seen this coming of more than 32 000 communities analyzed
[3:53:52.280 --> 3:53:57.320]  16 000 equivalent to 46 had all their burglary cases in a three-year period
[3:53:57.320 --> 3:54:01.080]  closed with no suspect charged by police almost 2000 of the
[3:54:01.080 --> 3:54:04.680]  neighborhoods each containing around 3000 residents recorded at least 25
[3:54:04.680 --> 3:54:08.680]  burglaries but none were solved despite the impact on victims it was revealed
[3:54:08.680 --> 3:54:12.920]  that some forces no longer dispatch an officer to the scene of a burglary
[3:54:12.920 --> 3:54:17.880]  because it's not considered a policing priority what is considered a policing
[3:54:17.880 --> 3:54:23.160]  priority these days arresting over 3000 people a year for offensive online
[3:54:23.160 --> 3:54:25.960]  comments that's more of a priority arresting and
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:30.840]  convicting a man for posting offensive george floyd memes in a private chat
[3:54:30.840 --> 3:54:35.240]  group then sending him to prison for 20 weeks that's more of a priority
[3:54:35.240 --> 3:54:39.000]  investigating and interrogating a homicide man because he liked a tweet
[3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:43.640]  deemed to be transphobic didn't even tweet it merely liked the tweet
[3:54:43.640 --> 3:54:47.240]  that's more of a priority charging a 50 year old mother in scotland with a
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:51.640]  transphobic hate crime for retweeting an image of a suffragette ribbon
[3:54:51.640 --> 3:54:55.400]  that's more of a priority arresting a 38 year old woman in front of her own
[3:54:55.400 --> 3:54:58.840]  children and locking her up for seven hours because she referred to a
[3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:03.880]  transgender woman as a man that's more of a priority creating ad campaigns for
[3:55:03.880 --> 3:55:08.200]  international pronouns day warning people that misgendering others
[3:55:08.200 --> 3:55:11.640]  is a form of abuse that's more of a priority creating public
[3:55:11.640 --> 3:55:15.400]  awareness campaigns where cops stand outside supermarkets with giant
[3:55:15.400 --> 3:55:19.480]  billboards that ominously warn being offensive is an offense
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:23.400]  that's more of a priority maybe in future homeowners should just tell the
[3:55:23.400 --> 3:55:27.080]  police that during the burglary the robber made a racist comment
[3:55:27.080 --> 3:55:34.280]  maybe then they'll actually respond criminal burglars house
[3:55:34.280 --> 3:55:45.240]  person is offensive on social media
[3:55:49.080 --> 3:55:52.840]  now i talked before about what happened in late guarder italy with this mob of
[3:55:52.840 --> 3:55:56.440]  2000 migrant youths running rampage through the streets
[3:55:56.440 --> 3:56:00.600]  and i also promised to tell you about what happened to a fish
[3:56:00.600 --> 3:56:05.640]  in belgium yes we have another example of cultural enrichment this time
[3:56:05.640 --> 3:56:10.200]  at a water park near again police in belgium are looking for a group of
[3:56:10.200 --> 3:56:14.040]  migrant background youths and it's the usual demographic north african
[3:56:14.040 --> 3:56:17.160]  middle eastern who filmed themselves abusing a
[3:56:17.160 --> 3:56:21.800]  fish at a water park near again some cultures are better than others
[3:56:21.800 --> 3:56:26.040]  a clip of the animal abuse was posted on tiktok basically they find this
[3:56:26.040 --> 3:56:29.800]  large carp throw it around a bit torture it a bit
[3:56:29.800 --> 3:56:33.480]  push it down a water slide apparently that's really funny and requires the
[3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:38.520]  involvement of about two dozen people police are now looking for these
[3:56:38.520 --> 3:56:41.720]  suspects after members of the public reported the
[3:56:41.720 --> 3:56:48.040]  incident as animal abuse after it went viral on tiktok now this
[3:56:48.040 --> 3:56:51.480]  always happens in the summer these kind of scenes because we have
[3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:56.040]  numerous altercations that occur at outdoor swimming parks and water parks
[3:56:56.040 --> 3:57:01.640]  of this nature predominantly involving groups of migrant youths
[3:57:01.640 --> 3:57:04.920]  and migrant men this happens on a regular basis
[3:57:04.920 --> 3:57:10.200]  and it's happening once again this year remix news reports 65 percent of french
[3:57:10.200 --> 3:57:13.400]  people feel there is too much immigration in their country
[3:57:13.400 --> 3:57:17.160]  of course we have the unprecedented success of marine lapen and a national
[3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:22.600]  rally party on monday achieving 88 seats in parliament will now two
[3:57:22.600 --> 3:57:26.280]  thirds of french people believe that immigration levels are too high in the
[3:57:26.280 --> 3:57:30.040]  country a new poll has revealed of course we had
[3:57:30.040 --> 3:57:33.400]  lapen victoria she's hopefully going to address that
[3:57:33.400 --> 3:57:36.120]  and we're going to start to roll back some of this
[3:57:36.120 --> 3:57:40.840]  accelerating demographic influx that's going to wrap it up for summit news hour
