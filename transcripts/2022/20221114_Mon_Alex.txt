[00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.930]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.512]  stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:17.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:22.458]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:26.501]  Well, we kick off another week here.
[00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:29.363]  Breaking news.
[00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.405]  Groundbreaking coverage.
[00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:34.847]  The great crew, the great audience, all of it.
[00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.249]  Born for this moment.
[00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:38.210]  In the info war.
[00:00:39.455 --> 00:00:48.262]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I've got tons of news today and obviously the big stories being the midterm election shenanigans.
[00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:56.989]  I mean, if you don't at least doubt what's going on or have questions at this point, you're just lying to yourself, you're lying to everyone around you, you're a scumbag.
[00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.554]  But we always had that feeling about you liberals.
[00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:07.818]  And then there's the FTX scandal that really is just the icing on the cake.
[00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:20.752]  And it's the icing on the cake that just shows how the American left ignores all their own crimes while pointing the finger at conservatives with their made-up crimes.
[00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:24.273]  And then, okay, that's just between us.
[00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:33.336]  Then there's the government approach where they're all focused on going after Elon Musk right now and you watch the FTX guys will probably get ignored.
[00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.776]  The one guy was still tweeting as of moments ago.
[00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:37.917]  So here's a special report from Greg Reese
[00:01:39.006 --> 00:01:49.657]  With all the swamp connections, all the swamp-filled muck that the entire FTX Democrat money laundering through Ukraine scandal has involved with it.
[00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:51.358]  And we'll come back and get to the news.
[00:01:51.358 --> 00:01:52.900]  Here's a special report from Greg Reese.
[00:01:59.748 --> 00:02:11.178]  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was the largest donor to the Democrat Party, second to George Soros for the spurious 2022 midterms.
[00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:16.723]  Nearly $40 million, which reportedly came from crypto donations to Ukraine.
[00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:23.861]  FTX was partnered with the World Economic Forum as one of Klaus Schwab's stakeholders.
[00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:35.346]  FTX's founder reportedly used a secret backdoor to steal over a billion dollars from the customers of the now defunct cryptocurrency exchange.
[00:02:35.346 --> 00:02:42.049]  But there's more to the story than Sam Bankman-Fried and a money laundering slush fund for the failing Democrat Party.
[00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.256]  The CEO for FTX was Caroline Ellison, whose father is Glenn Ellison, head of the MIT Economics Department.
[00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:58.742]  Glenn Ellison hired Gary Gensler to head the Cryptocurrency Department at MIT in 2018.
[00:02:58.742 --> 00:03:05.388]  And in 2021, the Biden administration nominated Gary Gensler as the chair of the U.S.
[00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:11.373]  Securities and Exchange Commission, who has been laser-focused on gaining control of cryptocurrency.
[00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:26.905]  While the SEC has been routinely combative towards cryptos, they have treated FTX like family, causing many to argue that FTX was being groomed and set up by the SEC to monopolize the crypto market.
[00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:32.350]  FTX was an exchange that had a bright sheen on it.
[00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.335]  It was led by a CEO that was often on Capitol Hill and being photographed with regulators and lawmakers.
[00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:43.170]  And so there was a sense that the exchange was very buttoned up.
[00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.319]  Cryptocurrency has the potential to strip power from the central banking system.
[00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.042]  And that makes it a major threat.
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.086]  As this story unfolds, don't be surprised if this mess becomes the catalyst for government overreach into cryptocurrencies.
[00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:08.032]  The Journal reporting the CEO allegedly using customer money from FTX to fund risky bets at his other company, a hedge fund called Alameda.
[00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:13.055]  Many people believe that this will definitely set back the crypto industry for years.
[00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:16.237]  You know, this is a tale as old as time to some degree.
[00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:23.801]  Some young, charismatic guy in Bermuda shorts with the floppy hair, uh, charmed the 20 best investors in the world.
[00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.722]  Rebecca, the big question here, was this a mistake by the founders or a crime?
[00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:31.544]  Well, that's a question the regulators will ultimately have to answer here.
[00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:36.266]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:37.267]  Was it a crime?
[00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:39.127]  Well, of course not!
[00:04:39.127 --> 00:04:40.868]  It was Democrats!
[00:04:40.868 --> 00:04:41.409]  It was Liberals!
[00:04:43.124 --> 00:04:44.325]  And it was Ukraine!
[00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:46.308]  No crime here!
[00:04:46.308 --> 00:04:48.750]  No crime at all!
[00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.834]  And your elections are totally fair!
[00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:57.219]  There's no shenanigans, there's no cheating in your elections, and there was no crime with FTX!
[00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.282]  Go back to sleep, America!
[00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:09.054]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:05:09.054 --> 00:05:20.657]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:05:20.657 --> 00:05:27.039]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists.
[00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.962]  We know their number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[00:05:32.962 --> 00:05:40.165]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.

[00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:15.692]  And honor and a privilege to be with you here on this Monday, November 14th, 2022.
[00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:20.316]  Live transmission of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:20.316 --> 00:06:22.058]  And we got great guests coming up today.
[00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:31.973]  We've got Matt Baker whose boots on the ground in Arizona talking to voters down there about what they saw at the polls.
[00:06:31.973 --> 00:06:38.816]  He's going to give his account of what he saw that day and beyond as they continue to count.
[00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:40.177]  It's election season now.
[00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:41.597]  It lasts months.
[00:06:41.597 --> 00:06:46.940]  We count votes until all Democrats win and then we declare the winner.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:54.544]  Joe Hoft with his deep dive into the election systems and how they're being used to rig elections.
[00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:58.668]  That went Joe Hoffman, the Gateway Pundit, at 12.30.
[00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:13.152]  And then Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, big crypto expert, to join and discuss the FTX scandal.
[00:07:13.152 --> 00:07:18.413]  But there's so much breaking now on all these different fronts.
[00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:23.935]  And I think that the average American is really beginning to wake up and realize what's going on.
[00:07:24.898 --> 00:07:40.954]  I think between FTX scandal, money laundering for the Democrat Party, and all of these election shenanigans that always favor the Democrat Party, the average American is waking up and realizing who are the bad guys, who are the good guys.
[00:07:41.818 --> 00:07:48.503]  The brainwashed people who are just in a total trance at this point, under complete mind control, they're just gone.
[00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:51.745]  They just are in the reality that is force-fed to them.
[00:07:51.745 --> 00:07:59.651]  They are in the reality that is presented to them, and they consume it every day, without any second thought.
[00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:01.893]  So, that's an incredible phenomenon.
[00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:09.959]  But to the rest of us, that can still think, that can still see, and still have a will to be free and prosper into the future,
[00:08:11.565 --> 00:08:15.048]  I think things are getting pretty clear.
[00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:38.366]  And what is amazing about the current dichotomy of the American political debate is that the conservative side is frustrated and upset that the leftist liberal side will not react to the truth.
[00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:50.693]  Whether it's the Hunter Biden story, whether it's all the election shenanigans, whether it's this FTX deal that'll be the latest thing.
[00:08:50.693 --> 00:08:59.219]  Conservatives are frustrated that liberals won't recognize and react to the truth.
[00:08:59.219 --> 00:09:06.364]  Whereas liberals, leftists, Democrats are angry, frustrated and upset that you won't react to their lies.
[00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:18.914]  Whether it's Russian collusion, or you're an election denier when they have denied every presidential election that they've lost in the 21st century.
[00:09:18.914 --> 00:09:24.475]  So, the average American, the person that can still see, can still think, is realizing this.
[00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:27.856]  Now that doesn't mean they're going to become right-wingers or conservatives or anything.
[00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:29.637]  They're just going to know who the bad guys are.
[00:09:29.637 --> 00:09:33.918]  They're just going to have their eyes open to start asking the right questions and maybe getting the answers.
[00:09:33.918 --> 00:09:35.519]  Elon Musk might be a good example.
[00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:42.326]  Which is why they're going to be going after Elon Musk.
[00:09:42.326 --> 00:09:47.309]  The Justice Department, the Biden administration is going to be aggressively going after Elon Musk.
[00:09:47.309 --> 00:09:56.194]  More so than they will after the FTX deal with those criminals because they were Democrats.
[00:09:56.194 --> 00:10:03.118]  And Elon Musk has said as much recently in public statements.
[00:10:03.118 --> 00:10:05.380]  So we'll be covering that and they do have
[00:10:06.115 --> 00:10:32.290]  They do have basically some anvils over Elon Musk's head right now that my guess is behind the scenes some form of a government entity or democrat entity is basically giving Elon Musk the wink and the nod saying look you play ball with us these anvils we have over your head here that we could cut the rope at any minute are going to fall and crush you if you don't.
[00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.251]  So I'll explain that coming up.
[00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:38.113]  But what is it about U.S.
[00:10:38.113 --> 00:10:41.115]  elections that take months now?
[00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:43.096]  And yes, it is months.
[00:10:43.096 --> 00:10:43.796]  It is months.
[00:10:43.796 --> 00:10:51.320]  And in fact, I don't know when early voting officially opened in Texas, but my guess is it was probably about a month ago.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.082]  Probably about October 14th or so.
[00:10:54.082 --> 00:10:58.804]  So, or you can go, better yet, look at Arizona.
[00:10:58.804 --> 00:10:59.865]  Probably the same thing.
[00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:02.721]  In fact, guys, see if you can find out.
[00:11:02.721 --> 00:11:07.223]  Let's find out when Arizona opened early voting for the 2022 midterms.
[00:11:07.223 --> 00:11:19.226]  So you have month-long elections now, and we all know the system, which is we just count votes until the Democrat wins, and then we stop.
[00:11:19.226 --> 00:11:20.787]  That's how we play.
[00:11:20.787 --> 00:11:22.808]  That's the game we play.
[00:11:22.808 --> 00:11:30.650]  And the Republican leadership of the McLoosers, McConnell, McCarthy, and McDaniel, the McLoos team,
[00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:50.718]  They're more focused on getting rid of Donald Trump, and for the last two years have been working behind the scenes, trying to figure out how to get rid of Donald Trump after the midterms, that they let Georgia slip out of their hands, they let Arizona slip out of their hands, and they're letting Nevada get stolen in broad daylight.
[00:11:50.718 --> 00:11:53.699]  They've already given up Pennsylvania, they've already given up Michigan.
[00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:59.681]  Miracle win in Wisconsin, but I think there's a reason for that, we'll explain, with Joe Hoft.
[00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:00.881]  There was a strategy there.
[00:12:02.927 --> 00:12:13.832]  But the good news is, and we will be mentioning, or getting deeper into the story today, is that the Republican leadership that is, has now an expiration date of yesterday.
[00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:23.597]  And we opened up the milk carton and took one whiff and said, yep, this is rotten, this is spoiled, give it the toss.
[00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:27.579]  And so Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Ronald McDaniel really thought they could pull this off.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.603]  They really thought that they could have a complete disaster of a midterm elections that should have been much more successful for Republicans.
[00:12:34.603 --> 00:12:42.107]  And then immediately on the Wednesday after the election day, take the long knives out for Donald Trump.
[00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:43.828]  You really think we wouldn't notice that?
[00:12:43.828 --> 00:12:47.370]  You really think we wouldn't realize what you were up to all of these years?
[00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.192]  And why you abandoned us in Arizona?
[00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:51.973]  And why you abandoned us in Georgia?
[00:12:51.973 --> 00:12:53.654]  And why you abandoned us in Nevada?
[00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:57.737]  And why you've just given Pennsylvania and Michigan to the Democrats?
[00:12:57.737 --> 00:12:58.758]  Now we know why.
[00:12:58.758 --> 00:13:05.843]  Because Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Ronald McDaniel all were scheming how to get rid of Donald Trump.
[00:13:05.843 --> 00:13:09.625]  And Kevin McCarthy was in there like a little rat.
[00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:12.307]  Cozying up to Donald Trump.
[00:13:12.307 --> 00:13:16.469]  He's a rat.
[00:13:16.469 --> 00:13:17.630]  And so here we are.
[00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.891]  They're still counting votes.
[00:13:18.891 --> 00:13:20.252]  They're still stealing Arizona.
[00:13:22.609 --> 00:13:24.190]  And the Republicans are in on it.
[00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.871]  But there will be a change of the guard.
[00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:29.372]  There is a new breed of a Republican.
[00:13:29.372 --> 00:13:32.033]  There is a hostile takeover of the Republican Party.
[00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:45.998]  And now, quite frankly, it appears that the establishment has made the decision even easier for us, moving forward, which is, in this current window of time, we've got to support Donald Trump.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:14:14.294]  And I'm not saying he's the best candidate, and I'm not saying he hasn't made big mistakes, and I'm not saying that we got issues to clear up here, but clearly at this point, the deep state and the establishment want Trump out of the picture, and more importantly, he is going to have to be the one that is the head of this hostile takeover, this populist takeover of the Republican Party.
[00:14:15.066 --> 00:14:20.147]  And thank God, Ron DeSantis never took the bait.
[00:14:20.147 --> 00:14:25.348]  Thank God Ron DeSantis is just keeping his head down, doing a great job in Florida.
[00:14:25.348 --> 00:14:32.210]  And Trump is basically just puffing up his chest and he's like a bull in a china shop at this point.
[00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.510]  And so maybe it's not the best way to go about it.
[00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.091]  But here's what I think the long-term plan is.
[00:14:39.998 --> 00:14:58.027]  If they can't separate Trump from his voters and his base, and they can't get a DeSantis or a Junkin or someone else to step up and run against Trump, the Democrats will go for an indictment and an arrest, probably within the next year.
[00:15:02.188 --> 00:15:03.409]  But the awakening is on.
[00:15:03.409 --> 00:15:04.729]  Everybody's watching what they're doing.
[00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:07.771]  Oh, let's just count votes until the Democrat wins.
[00:15:07.771 --> 00:15:11.093]  In Arizona, where Katie Hobbs didn't campaign.
[00:15:11.093 --> 00:15:12.533]  Had no energy.
[00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:15.915]  The few rallies she did have had less than a hundred people.
[00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.656]  Lake had massive rallies.
[00:15:18.656 --> 00:15:19.917]  So people are just watching now.
[00:15:19.917 --> 00:15:20.617]  They're watching.
[00:15:20.617 --> 00:15:21.818]  They're finally paying attention.
[00:15:21.818 --> 00:15:27.821]  They've kind of looked away from the football game and looked away from the bread and circus and looked away from the Kim Kardashian butt.
[00:15:28.693 --> 00:15:38.495]  And they're watching how their country's being stolen, and they're watching how Democrats are above the law, and more people are now putting skin in the game.
[00:15:38.495 --> 00:15:45.137]  So despite all the bad political news, I do think there's a silver lining to all of this, and it always had to get to this point, didn't it?
[00:15:45.137 --> 00:15:53.579]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:15:53.579 --> 00:15:54.599]  Here's why.
[00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:57.900]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.641]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:12.623]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.

[00:19:57.978 --> 00:20:08.643]  I'm going to get into all of the headlines now involving the 2022 midterm elections that are ongoing!
[00:20:08.643 --> 00:20:09.143]  You thought
[00:20:18.704 --> 00:20:21.006]  Elections work like this.
[00:20:21.006 --> 00:20:24.289]  You show up, you vote, your vote is counted just like everyone else.
[00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:25.950]  Wrong-o!
[00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.732]  Wrong-o!
[00:20:27.732 --> 00:20:30.294]  You show up, you vote, maybe your vote counts, maybe not.
[00:20:30.294 --> 00:20:34.337]  Maybe it's cancelled out by some moronic brainwashed sheep.
[00:20:34.337 --> 00:20:36.219]  Maybe it's cancelled out by a machine algorithm.
[00:20:36.219 --> 00:20:38.721]  Maybe it's cancelled out by a mail-in vote from a dog.
[00:20:38.721 --> 00:20:43.645]  And we just keep counting votes till the Democrats ahead and then we declare the winner!
[00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.291]  That's how the elections go in the United States of America.
[00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:54.372]  Anywhere else, the UN would move in and take over and say, this is clearly a fraudulent election.
[00:20:54.372 --> 00:20:55.132]  But not here.
[00:20:55.132 --> 00:20:56.933]  It's just par for the course.
[00:20:56.933 --> 00:21:01.473]  And the American liberal, the American leftist, doesn't even bat an eye.
[00:21:01.473 --> 00:21:03.294]  Doesn't even bat an eye.
[00:21:03.294 --> 00:21:10.315]  But they'll fall for Russian collusion and Russian interference and meddling.
[00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:12.856]  Yes, they will, won't they?
[00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:13.736]  Well, they already have.
[00:21:14.904 --> 00:21:17.266]  Here's the news.
[00:21:17.266 --> 00:21:20.269]  As the story is ongoing, Democrats will take the Senate.
[00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:23.171]  They're fighting for the House right now.
[00:21:23.171 --> 00:21:27.135]  But are they really going to get away with such a big steal in Colorado and Maryland?
[00:21:30.439 --> 00:21:35.501]  GOP didn't lose the midterms because mail-in ballots are better than in-person voting.
[00:21:35.501 --> 00:21:40.223]  The GOP lost because the same corrupt election activities happened again.
[00:21:40.223 --> 00:21:40.923]  That's Joe Hoft.
[00:21:40.923 --> 00:21:41.684]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:21:41.684 --> 00:21:44.785]  He's got a lot of great stories right now that he's going to be joining us on.
[00:21:44.785 --> 00:21:53.929]  But here's what it comes down to, and I think here's the debate that the Republican Party should be having moving forward, because they're never going to win another election
[00:21:55.126 --> 00:21:58.188]  Nationally, probably, with the current structure in place.
[00:21:58.188 --> 00:22:00.309]  And they're certainly never going to win Pennsylvania.
[00:22:00.309 --> 00:22:01.429]  They're never going to win Michigan.
[00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:02.990]  They're never going to win Georgia.
[00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:08.733]  And now it appears they'll never win Arizona or Nevada either with the current system in place.
[00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:13.896]  And so they can sit here and we can talk about voter fraud and election fraud and all this stuff.
[00:22:13.896 --> 00:22:14.756]  It doesn't even matter anymore.
[00:22:14.756 --> 00:22:15.696]  That's clear.
[00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:16.217]  That's clear.
[00:22:16.217 --> 00:22:17.337]  The message has been sent.
[00:22:17.337 --> 00:22:18.338]  They will steal the election.
[00:22:18.338 --> 00:22:19.158]  They will rig elections.
[00:22:19.158 --> 00:22:20.639]  They will do whatever shenanigans they can.
[00:22:21.637 --> 00:22:22.578]  And that's it.
[00:22:22.578 --> 00:22:23.839]  That's how it's going to go.
[00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:28.441]  So the debate for the Republican Party now needs to be, are we going to stop this?
[00:22:28.441 --> 00:22:37.187]  And are we going to have a serious push for in-person, day-of voting, paper ballots?
[00:22:37.187 --> 00:22:48.333]  Which is the only way to stop this from continuing, this madness, this month-long election season madness, where we keep counting votes until we like the outcome.
[00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.895]  Or does the Republican Party say, okay,
[00:22:52.316 --> 00:22:55.418]  That's an unwinnable fight.
[00:22:55.418 --> 00:22:56.479]  Let's not even try it.
[00:22:56.479 --> 00:22:58.741]  Instead, let's just play by the new rules.
[00:22:58.741 --> 00:23:03.885]  And Republicans just send out millions of mail-in ballots to everybody and their dogs.
[00:23:03.885 --> 00:23:10.790]  And what the Republicans should have done this midterm election season, but, you know, they don't listen here at InfoWars.
[00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.052]  They don't listen to the voices out there that give them good advice.
[00:23:14.052 --> 00:23:17.635]  They keep going back to the same establishment hacks that suck their toes.
[00:23:19.651 --> 00:23:23.252]  No, what the Republicans should have been doing is exactly what the Democrats were doing.
[00:23:23.252 --> 00:23:44.977]  This is why they brag about the youth turnout for Democrats, because they had all of their candidates campaign on college campuses, specifically targeting that vote, and then they had voting registration booths set up, and they had early voting stations set up right there at the event.
[00:23:44.977 --> 00:23:47.538]  That's what you do now.
[00:23:47.538 --> 00:23:47.698]  So,
[00:23:48.698 --> 00:24:16.359]  If you want to give up the hope of fair elections, one person, one vote, in-day voting, which sadly might have to be the case, then you have got to take the same measurements and actions that the Democrats are to drum up as many votes they possibly can from people who normally wouldn't vote and before election day.
[00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:20.999]  And by the way, if you play this game, you win.
[00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:29.223]  Because the biggest rallies for Democrats were happening on college campuses with the youth.
[00:24:29.223 --> 00:24:30.604]  They did pretty well at those events.
[00:24:30.604 --> 00:24:33.385]  They would usually get a couple hundred people.
[00:24:33.385 --> 00:24:39.348]  And again, like I said, then they register you to vote, then you go vote early right across the street.
[00:24:39.348 --> 00:24:44.111]  Now, Republicans have rally sizes 20, 30, 40 times bigger than Democrats.
[00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:56.635]  So imagine a Trump rally, with Scott Pressler outside, registering people to vote, and across the street, an early voting center.
[00:24:56.635 --> 00:24:57.655]  At a Trump rally.
[00:24:57.655 --> 00:25:01.796]  You just got 30,000 Republican votes.
[00:25:01.796 --> 00:25:03.957]  Just like that.
[00:25:03.957 --> 00:25:14.260]  And the Democrats are doing this across the country with their midterm candidates, but in particularly, the college students that are voting for the first time.
[00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:31.585]  And they would get, probably, they probably were able to siphon about 1,000, 1,500, maybe even 2,000 votes with this phenomenon at college campuses that they went to, like University of Texas, Austin.
[00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:37.448]  So that's the debate the Republican Party, if it wants to find a way to win, should be having right now.
[00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:43.352]  Do we push hard to actually return our election, our elections to being fair?
[00:25:45.865 --> 00:25:49.887]  With in-person voting, day of voting, paper ballots?
[00:25:49.887 --> 00:26:00.933]  Or do we just say, no point in trying to save that system, let's just cheat like the Democrats and be better at it than they are?
[00:26:00.933 --> 00:26:01.814]  This is a big story.
[00:26:01.814 --> 00:26:05.075]  I might just come back and read this whole thing.
[00:26:05.075 --> 00:26:10.058]  Anonymous Wisconsin heroes demonstrated how to collapse the Democrat ballot gathering apparatus.
[00:26:10.058 --> 00:26:12.299]  So again, there is a way to push back against this.
[00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:12.960]  This one is key.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.121]  I may just come back to that and read the whole thing honestly.
[00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:17.079]  It's that good.
[00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:26.385]  Despite only 17% Democrat turnout on Election Day, Katie Hobbs and Democrats are winning over 50% of Maricopa County Election Day totals.
[00:26:26.385 --> 00:26:30.768]  And you know, I feel bad for the people on the hopium out there.
[00:26:30.768 --> 00:26:32.089]  And that's okay.
[00:26:32.089 --> 00:26:33.791]  That's okay.
[00:26:33.791 --> 00:26:37.573]  Infowars is always crossing the threshold first.
[00:26:37.573 --> 00:26:41.216]  Infowars is always crossing the barbed wire first.
[00:26:41.216 --> 00:26:44.438]  Alex Jones has always been the canary in the coal mine.
[00:26:44.438 --> 00:26:45.579]  So I don't
[00:26:46.624 --> 00:26:54.891]  I don't have a kind of, you know, I'm not laughing at them, but at the same time, it is kind of sad to see all the hopium.
[00:26:54.891 --> 00:26:56.933]  Oh, oh, Carrie Lake has the vote.
[00:26:56.933 --> 00:26:58.194]  She has the numbers.
[00:26:58.194 --> 00:27:00.255]  For sure, she has the numbers.
[00:27:00.255 --> 00:27:03.438]  Do you really not get it yet?
[00:27:03.438 --> 00:27:05.039]  You don't know what the Democrats are doing?
[00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:12.205]  You don't think that they're going to give you the exact number of percent that you think Carrie Lake needs, and then it's just going to be a little bit short in the end?
[00:27:12.205 --> 00:27:15.628]  You haven't figured it out yet?
[00:27:16.721 --> 00:27:17.642]  Okay, fine.
[00:27:17.642 --> 00:27:22.746]  Well, you enjoy learning it for yourself the hard way.
[00:27:22.746 --> 00:27:24.007]  But that's good.
[00:27:24.007 --> 00:27:24.548]  That's good.
[00:27:24.548 --> 00:27:26.209]  This is the awakening process.
[00:27:26.209 --> 00:27:28.130]  This is people realizing they've been lied to.
[00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.552]  This is people realizing their elections are rigged.
[00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:31.994]  We realized it decades ago.
[00:27:31.994 --> 00:27:33.595]  You realized it decades ago.
[00:27:33.595 --> 00:27:34.275]  This is good.
[00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:35.116]  This is good.
[00:27:35.116 --> 00:27:39.780]  And this is what all the people would lambast Alex Jones and InfoWars for talking about.
[00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.381]  Oh!
[00:27:41.381 --> 00:27:42.943]  Oh!
[00:27:42.943 --> 00:27:43.483]  Oh!
[00:27:43.483 --> 00:27:44.484]  Oh, you get it now, do ya?
[00:27:45.692 --> 00:27:52.276]  Maricopa dropped shocking Sunday numbers, claim only 50% for Kerry Lake from Election Day, and independents went to Hobbs.
[00:27:52.276 --> 00:27:53.057]  The steal is on.
[00:27:53.057 --> 00:27:56.679]  Yeah, nobody's buying this, but see, oh, what I, oh, oh, 54%?
[00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:58.800]  Oh, you thought you'd get 65?
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.181]  Oh.
[00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:09.527]  You thought you'd get actual representation?
[00:28:09.527 --> 00:28:10.467]  Yeah.
[00:28:10.467 --> 00:28:11.148]  Yeah, you did.
[00:28:12.498 --> 00:28:13.479]  Yeah, you did.
[00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:15.801]  What happens when a criminal doesn't get arrested for his crimes?
[00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:16.921]  Well, he commits the crime again!
[00:28:16.921 --> 00:28:20.124]  Video montage.
[00:28:20.124 --> 00:28:28.610]  Arizona Republican voters describe how ballots were not counted, ballots were tossed in a box, and people were not allowed to vote.
[00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.914]  Maricopa County election judge believes the machines were programmed to reject ballots on election day.
[00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.072]  The Democrats are stopping voter fraud, guys.
[00:28:41.072 --> 00:28:43.535]  The Democrats are protecting our elections, guys.
[00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:45.216]  Come on, that's Stacey Abrams told me.
[00:28:45.216 --> 00:28:53.664]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[00:28:53.664 --> 00:28:54.665]  Here's why.
[00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:57.968]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:03.689]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:12.691]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:20.673]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[00:29:21.383 --> 00:29:27.468]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[00:29:27.468 --> 00:29:31.311]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[00:29:31.311 --> 00:29:33.313]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[00:29:46.363 --> 00:29:50.887]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[00:29:52.410 --> 00:30:01.552]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:30:01.552 --> 00:30:05.914]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[00:30:05.914 --> 00:30:10.875]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:16.214]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:54.653]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:30:54.653 --> 00:31:06.280]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:12.644]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars, because we know the globalists
[00:31:12.824 --> 00:31:13.044]  I think?

[00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:12.627]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.627 --> 00:33:17.630]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:23.833]  There was a shooting at the University of Virginia last night.
[00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:26.815]  Three killed.
[00:33:26.815 --> 00:33:29.497]  And the suspect has now been arrested.
[00:33:29.497 --> 00:33:31.318]  It looks like it may have been a targeted shooting.
[00:33:32.282 --> 00:33:37.544]  Of football players, because all three of them were football players getting off a bus.
[00:33:37.544 --> 00:33:44.106]  But, I remember seeing this on social media last night, but nothing on the news.
[00:33:44.106 --> 00:33:47.747]  And there's pretty much been a news blackout on this today.
[00:33:47.747 --> 00:33:49.828]  We'll see if anybody covers it tonight.
[00:33:49.828 --> 00:33:51.808]  Mass shooting, college, university, three dead.
[00:33:51.808 --> 00:33:54.669]  You'd think they'd be all over the story.
[00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:58.090]  Well folks, they won't be.
[00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.251]  And if you know why, you know why.
[00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:04.903]  Doesn't really fit the narrative, this one, so they'll move on from that.
[00:34:04.903 --> 00:34:06.564]  I mean, do I need to check?
[00:34:06.564 --> 00:34:11.890]  I mean, guys, should I, uh, go ahead and plug it into a Google search, uh, violent Chicago over the weekend.
[00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:13.331]  Go ahead and put it up.
[00:34:13.331 --> 00:34:16.294]  But hold on, though, because I have to cover this so often.
[00:34:16.294 --> 00:34:18.517]  This is how sick I am.
[00:34:18.517 --> 00:34:21.560]  Let's give you the Vegas odds.
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.521]  Uh, over under
[00:34:23.713 --> 00:34:26.695]  Numbers probably down, it's getting a little colder.
[00:34:26.695 --> 00:34:32.298]  Over under 65 shot and 2.5 dead in Chicago this weekend, over under.
[00:34:32.298 --> 00:34:34.499]  Alright guys, give me the numbers.
[00:34:34.499 --> 00:34:37.140]  Let's go ahead and pull them up now.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:47.525]  Because you know, we want to stop gun crime, and we highlight the gun crimes, and we blame the Republicans and the NRA, and we say we should take the guns, but we never mention what goes on in Chicago every weekend.
[00:34:47.525 --> 00:34:49.766]  Because it doesn't fit the narrative.
[00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:52.164]  Five!
[00:34:52.164 --> 00:34:54.225]  That hits the over easy, doesn't it?
[00:34:54.225 --> 00:35:03.787]  Five this weekend, including 12-year-old girl among 20 wounded, so under on the shot, over on the killed.
[00:35:03.787 --> 00:35:04.687]  Sad, sad thing.
[00:35:04.687 --> 00:35:06.087]  Every weekend in Chicago!
[00:35:06.087 --> 00:35:12.769]  I'm a sick person for making a joke of it, but it's every weekend in Chicago, folks.
[00:35:12.769 --> 00:35:16.850]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, it's great to be here with you today, and I have to tell you,
[00:35:18.405 --> 00:35:24.427]  I've got a little bottle of Brain Force Ultra right here, and you may notice that it's almost empty.
[00:35:24.427 --> 00:35:25.508]  I did a big chug.
[00:35:25.508 --> 00:35:28.149]  I did a big chug about 10 minutes before going on air.
[00:35:28.149 --> 00:35:29.269]  Probably did too much.
[00:35:29.269 --> 00:35:31.270]  You're not supposed to drink that much, but it's okay.
[00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.550]  I'm an expert.
[00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.011]  So do not try this at home.
[00:35:34.011 --> 00:35:36.632]  I'm just the Brain Force Ultra expert.
[00:35:36.632 --> 00:35:40.173]  And with a big, big juicy brain, it needs a little bit of extra.
[00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:43.535]  I'm being facetious, of course, but I love the product.
[00:35:43.535 --> 00:35:44.575]  I think you will, too.
[00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:45.436]  Give it a try.

[00:35:48.337 --> 00:35:54.121]  I love to take it before I go on air for mental focus, mental clarity, mental energy.
[00:35:54.121 --> 00:36:02.266]  And if you're out there listening, you got a big work project, a big presentation, perfect to take to get prepared for that or before the presentation.
[00:36:02.266 --> 00:36:05.608]  If you're in school, you got a big exam, a big final, a big project.
[00:36:06.201 --> 00:36:11.685]  Forget about those pharmaceutical drugs that are so bad for you, your doctor wants to prescribe and make money off you.
[00:36:11.685 --> 00:36:15.689]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com, try the BrainForce Ultra for yourself.
[00:36:15.689 --> 00:36:16.809]  It's 50% off.

[00:36:25.236 --> 00:36:26.177]  Telling you once you've tried it,
[00:36:27.256 --> 00:36:28.577]  You'll never go back.
[00:36:28.577 --> 00:36:32.480]  There's just nothing else like it when it comes to mental focus and energy.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:36.303]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:36:36.303 --> 00:36:42.528]  All right, let's get back into the election headlines here.
[00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:50.715]  Maricopa election officials launched a PAC in 2021 to stop MAGA candidates.
[00:36:50.715 --> 00:36:54.518]  And that's the Republican establishment that was also
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:03.067]  Working with the Democrat Party in the midterm elections to make Trump-backed candidates look bad.
[00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:19.081]  And that attack is ongoing today with Trump-backed candidates that actually did well in the midterms, now having their House races, the votes still being tallied, conveniently, right up until the Democrat takes the lead.
[00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:22.896]  And so now you hear them saying, oh, the Democrats might take the House.
[00:37:22.896 --> 00:37:26.879]  Well, sure, they're counting votes for... What are we... We're now a week later!
[00:37:26.879 --> 00:37:29.721]  They just keep finding Democrat votes!
[00:37:29.721 --> 00:37:30.362]  It's amazing!
[00:37:30.362 --> 00:37:35.126]  It's like, oh yeah, look, the Republican won in Maryland.
[00:37:35.126 --> 00:37:37.207]  Not so fast, Democrats are finding votes.
[00:37:37.207 --> 00:37:39.029]  Oh yeah, look, the Republicans won in California.
[00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:41.110]  Not so fast, Democrats are finding votes.
[00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.411]  Oh yeah, Lauren Boebert held her seat.
[00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:44.213]  Not so fast, Democrats are finding votes!
[00:37:44.213 --> 00:37:46.335]  Come on, guys!
[00:37:47.646 --> 00:37:50.187]  It's Monday, November 14th, the week after the election.
[00:37:50.187 --> 00:37:53.068]  We gotta keep counting those votes!
[00:37:53.068 --> 00:37:58.050]  I'm surprised Democrats aren't running ads saying, still, it's not too late to vote.
[00:37:58.050 --> 00:38:00.411]  Go vote your local Democrat in the midterm.
[00:38:00.411 --> 00:38:04.053]  We will make sure it counts.
[00:38:04.053 --> 00:38:06.054]  Here's an amazing story from Joe Hoft.
[00:38:06.054 --> 00:38:09.975]  He's joining us later at the Gateway Pundit.
[00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:11.216]  Posted by Jay Valentin.
[00:38:12.765 --> 00:38:17.736]  Anonymous Wisconsin heroes demonstrated how to collapse the Democrat ballot gathering apparatus.
[00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:20.407]  Ballots and votes.
[00:38:20.407 --> 00:38:25.272]  These two words seem synonymous, yet infer opposite ways to choose a government.
[00:38:25.272 --> 00:38:28.214]  There's a big difference between votes and ballots.
[00:38:28.214 --> 00:38:30.076]  The Republicans focused on winning votes.
[00:38:30.076 --> 00:38:32.418]  The Democrats focused on gathering ballots.
[00:38:32.418 --> 00:38:33.499]  The ballots won.
[00:38:33.499 --> 00:38:41.967]  When election day became election month, mail-in ballots replacing in-person voters, the electoral world changed forever, and it's not changing back.
[00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:44.470]  Democrats, experts in anything government-related,
[00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:50.342]  Drove states to change laws, increase voting delays, and loosen voter standards.
[00:38:50.342 --> 00:38:51.845]  Republican leadership dozed.
[00:38:54.562 --> 00:39:00.085]  Governmental organizations, leftists, big tech invented every conceivable way to manipulate the ballot process.
[00:39:00.085 --> 00:39:04.467]  Collect ballots, drop into street side bins, fill them out if the voter doesn't.
[00:39:04.467 --> 00:39:07.149]  This is a ballot gathering strategy and it worked.
[00:39:07.149 --> 00:39:10.591]  Republicans remain stuck in the same voter strategy for the last decade.
[00:39:10.591 --> 00:39:14.032]  Yard signs, fundraising, obscure websites, TV ads.
[00:39:14.032 --> 00:39:22.277]  The raw material of the ballot gathering strategy is the phantom voter or address every ballot needs to tie to someone, even if only a name on a list.
[00:39:23.843 --> 00:39:30.568]  Live votable ballots accumulate at addresses where the indicated voter does not reside.
[00:39:30.568 --> 00:39:34.991]  Those ballots gathered are the inventory of electoral victory.
[00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:38.193]  He who gathers them can vote them.
[00:39:38.193 --> 00:39:41.775]  The ballot gathering system was frictionless until 2020.
[00:39:41.775 --> 00:39:45.998]  Thousands of phantom addresses inhabited every state's voter list.
[00:39:45.998 --> 00:39:48.060]  Clever leftists built a national system.
[00:39:49.634 --> 00:39:59.763]  Now used by about 30 states to make sure voter rolls protected phantoms, using in-your-face messaging, Eric claimed it was a resource to keep voter rolls clean.
[00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:01.124]  No friction, no challenge.
[00:40:01.124 --> 00:40:03.386]  After 2020, everything changed.
[00:40:03.386 --> 00:40:12.714]  The once frictionless ballot gathering apparatus was challenged in every state as voter integrity teams, citizens at kitchen tables picked apart voter rolls.
[00:40:12.714 --> 00:40:16.057]  They quickly found tens of thousands of dead or moved voters
[00:40:16.983 --> 00:40:21.045]  There were innumerable addresses where no voter could possibly live.
[00:40:21.045 --> 00:40:24.586]  For the first time, there was pushback against ballot gathering.
[00:40:24.586 --> 00:40:28.407]  Citizens demanded voter rolls be cleaned and addresses be real.
[00:40:28.407 --> 00:40:36.290]  In too many cases, affidavits with photographs of an empty lot where several voters claimed to live failed to convince a judge to action.
[00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:37.511]  Not in Wisconsin!
[00:40:38.504 --> 00:40:47.026]  A Wisconsin voter integrity team found after reviewing scores of counties and localities the number of ballots and votes cast lined up.
[00:40:47.026 --> 00:40:53.528]  Democrats know how many votes they need and cast them during the forever campaign time in the name of phantoms.
[00:40:53.528 --> 00:41:02.050]  Their ballot inventory comes from real ballots sent to fake addresses then collected by someone never a Republican and voted.
[00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:06.192]  When evaluating any system, one asks, is there an inherent contradiction?
[00:41:06.192 --> 00:41:07.752]  Is there something in the system
[00:41:08.729 --> 00:41:16.750]  That when pushed to scale, and we'll make it, that the rest of my story disappears.
[00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.551]  How about that?
[00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:19.651]  Wow.
[00:41:19.651 --> 00:41:23.072]  I don't know what happened to the rest of the story, but it's not attached here, but that's okay.
[00:41:23.072 --> 00:41:24.592]  You get the point.
[00:41:24.592 --> 00:41:26.572]  As we're up against a break anyway.
[00:41:26.572 --> 00:41:29.553]  So they cleaned up the voter rolls in Florida, and what'd you see?
[00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:32.513]  Massive red wave.
[00:41:32.513 --> 00:41:35.174]  They made an effort to clean up the voter rolls in Wisconsin.
[00:41:35.174 --> 00:41:36.694]  Democrats couldn't steal the Senate seat.
[00:41:38.613 --> 00:41:41.554]  So we know that this is what goes on.
[00:41:41.554 --> 00:41:45.115]  It got caught in 2020.
[00:41:45.115 --> 00:41:50.357]  It got caught by Project Veritas and other journalists.
[00:41:50.357 --> 00:41:58.300]  Where dozens of ballots would go to a parking lot where nobody resides.
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:03.462]  And this would happen hundreds of times over.
[00:42:03.462 --> 00:42:05.283]  And then you can trace those ballots
[00:42:06.821 --> 00:42:15.591]  And those ballots end up being cast as mail-in ballots at one of the mail-in ballot drop boxes.
[00:42:15.591 --> 00:42:26.343]  I mean, if you can't see how mail-in ballots and mail-in ballot drop boxes are being used for fraud and cheating, you're just not being honest, are you?
[00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:28.105]  You're just not being honest whatsoever.
[00:42:28.914 --> 00:42:32.597]  But here's the amazing thing about the liberal left that I do give them credit for.
[00:42:32.597 --> 00:42:41.283]  They are somehow spiritually, cosmically connected because they all lie together in unison and they don't even have to communicate while they do it.
[00:42:41.283 --> 00:42:47.948]  Like, they all know they're cheating in these elections, but they don't have to talk about it, they just all know it.
[00:42:47.948 --> 00:42:49.990]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[00:42:50.774 --> 00:42:52.816]  And I'm also pointing right back at myself.
[00:42:52.816 --> 00:42:54.818]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[00:42:54.818 --> 00:42:56.860]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:58.622]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[00:42:58.622 --> 00:43:01.004]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[00:43:01.004 --> 00:43:02.446]  You forget to take the X3.
[00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.947]  And you know it makes your life better.
[00:43:03.947 --> 00:43:05.409]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[00:43:05.409 --> 00:43:06.570]  And you constantly forget.
[00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:08.532]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.173]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[00:43:45.314 --> 00:43:47.796]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[00:43:47.796 --> 00:43:49.077]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:43:49.077 --> 00:43:52.540]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.882]  Why can't we do this here?
[00:43:53.882 --> 00:43:56.364]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[00:43:56.364 --> 00:44:02.229]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:04.210]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.112]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[00:44:06.112 --> 00:44:08.033]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[00:44:08.033 --> 00:44:17.681]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single state.
[00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:19.762]  We need more of this communication, not less.
[00:44:49.036 --> 00:44:49.256]  I think?

[00:46:07.837 --> 00:46:12.282]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[00:46:12.282 --> 00:46:13.564]  And I need your support.
[00:46:13.564 --> 00:46:20.952]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com.

[00:46:30.019 --> 00:46:34.562]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[00:46:34.562 --> 00:46:38.785]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.

[00:47:03.962 --> 00:47:22.476]  So as I'm continuing to cover all the election news, and we'll continue to focus on Arizona with Matt Baker coming up, and then the overall election with Joe Hoft as well, Biden is embarrassing himself in the country.
[00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:32.183]  Meeting with Xi Jinping and fumbling around and muttering and stumbling through press conferences is just a total embarrassment.
[00:47:34.716 --> 00:47:36.197]  So just know that's going on.
[00:47:36.197 --> 00:47:39.238]  We might have some time to get to some of those clips.
[00:47:39.238 --> 00:47:42.839]  But let's continue to focus here on the election news.
[00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:49.702]  Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs to launch leadership challenge against Kevin McCarthy.
[00:47:49.702 --> 00:47:54.824]  Now, here's what I see going on right now with there's not going to be much.
[00:47:54.824 --> 00:47:59.286]  There's pretty much going to be almost no support for Mitch McConnell.
[00:47:59.286 --> 00:48:02.067]  To stay leadership in a leadership role.
[00:48:02.924 --> 00:48:04.445]  With the Republican Party in the Senate.
[00:48:04.445 --> 00:48:06.967]  Mitch McConnell pretty much has no backing.
[00:48:06.967 --> 00:48:08.248]  Kevin McCarthy does.
[00:48:08.248 --> 00:48:20.176]  Kevin McCarthy sidled himself up next to Donald Trump, pretended to be an ally, and then basically just went mute and went limp when we needed him the most.
[00:48:20.176 --> 00:48:21.337]  That's what Kevin McCarthy is.
[00:48:21.337 --> 00:48:26.140]  He's... He's impotent.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:31.404]  And so, maybe he's friendly with Trump, and maybe he's at least
[00:48:32.552 --> 00:48:38.096]  Not gonna bash Trump, but he's certainly no leader.
[00:48:38.096 --> 00:48:41.938]  But I do think there will be a struggle for the ouster of McCarthy.
[00:48:41.938 --> 00:48:45.801]  And it's gonna be Gates and Biggs apparently leading that charge.
[00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:46.801]  And it needs to be done.
[00:48:46.801 --> 00:48:58.309]  Whether Ken McCarthy is a snake in the grass, trying to get himself close to Trump, or whether he is just... He likes Trump, but he's just a weak Republican squish.
[00:48:58.309 --> 00:49:01.791]  Either way, he's got to go from a leadership role, but I think there'll be a struggle there.
[00:49:02.719 --> 00:49:05.281]  With McConnell, I don't think McConnell will have any backing.
[00:49:05.281 --> 00:49:07.722]  McConnell's pretty much done his final deed.
[00:49:07.722 --> 00:49:21.571]  McConnell's last deed as the Senate Minority Leader was to sabotage MAGA and sabotage Donald Trump and sabotage the Republicans in the midterm to blame Donald Trump.
[00:49:21.571 --> 00:49:24.313]  So, congratulations Mitch McConnell.
[00:49:24.313 --> 00:49:26.254]  That will be your ultimate legacy.
[00:49:26.254 --> 00:49:30.397]  A turncoat, a traitor, a feckless coward.
[00:49:31.644 --> 00:49:34.306]  That stabbed America in the back.
[00:49:34.306 --> 00:49:35.868]  Congratulations, Mitch McConnell.
[00:49:35.868 --> 00:49:37.509]  That is now your legacy.
[00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:44.815]  And we will make sure that that gets stamped on your political forehead.
[00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:50.320]  Because we will not forget as much what you did, but also what you didn't do.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.941]  But we know what you did with the money.
[00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:53.943]  We know how you sabotaged Trump candidates.
[00:49:53.943 --> 00:49:58.247]  We know how you sabotaged good candidates like Masters and Joe Kent and others.
[00:49:59.295 --> 00:50:07.145]  And so, Mitch McConnell's final legacy is the MAGA, populist, Republican midterm election.
[00:50:07.145 --> 00:50:09.709]  Saboteur.
[00:50:09.709 --> 00:50:10.530]  Saboteur.
[00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:15.576]  Now, I'd like to see Rand Paul replace him, but there might be some other good candidates there.
[00:50:15.576 --> 00:50:16.037]  We'll see.
[00:50:18.144 --> 00:50:19.725]  And I suggested this the other day.
[00:50:19.725 --> 00:50:20.926]  I also heard others suggest it.
[00:50:20.926 --> 00:50:22.767]  It looks like it may come true.
[00:50:22.767 --> 00:50:28.870]  Lee Zeldin is taking calls about replacing hapless Ronna McDaniel after she blew two landslide elections.
[00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.692]  Yes, Ronna McDaniel ended up being a real zero.
[00:50:32.692 --> 00:50:41.537]  I actually had high hopes for her in 2016 when she was kind of gaining popularity and working with women for Trump and stuff.
[00:50:41.537 --> 00:50:45.519]  But she pretty much squished out and was entirely worthless.
[00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:58.154]  In the midterms, if not a net negative in the midterms, and so Lee Zeldin, who's popular and had huge victories in New York, impossible to defeat the Democrats in New York, just impossible.
[00:50:58.154 --> 00:51:02.576]  They get 90% of the vote in New York City, so it's just game over before it even begins.
[00:51:02.576 --> 00:51:10.579]  But he did very well, and he, I think, would be a good candidate to take over the RNC from Ronna McDaniel.
[00:51:12.043 --> 00:51:13.324]  Time to get rid of the McLosers.
[00:51:13.324 --> 00:51:14.865]  Josh Hawley's on board.
[00:51:14.865 --> 00:51:20.108]  Senator Josh Hawley, time to bury the Republican Party, build something new.
[00:51:20.108 --> 00:51:28.273]  Now, I don't know if Rand Paul has any interest in being a Senate leader, but Josh Hawley does, and I think he'd be a fantastic one.
[00:51:28.273 --> 00:51:30.495]  And he's right.
[00:51:30.495 --> 00:51:34.357]  It is time to bury the old Republican Party and build something new.
[00:51:34.357 --> 00:51:36.598]  He gets it.
[00:51:36.598 --> 00:51:37.939]  He gets it.
[00:51:37.939 --> 00:51:39.040]  And so, that's why
[00:51:41.061 --> 00:51:42.522]  You know, I haven't really gotten in.
[00:51:42.522 --> 00:51:46.344]  I've covered the third party phenomenon every once in a while.
[00:51:46.344 --> 00:51:52.948]  But the self-righteousness of libertarians over the last week has been extremely distasteful.
[00:51:52.948 --> 00:51:55.109]  Specifically from the libertarian leadership.
[00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:59.672]  I don't mean to make a blanket statement because some libertarians got the big picture.
[00:51:59.672 --> 00:52:06.937]  Like in Arizona, where the libertarian a week or two before the election bowed out and endorsed Blake Masters.
[00:52:06.937 --> 00:52:08.938]  That would be the classy thing to do
[00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:13.871]  If you are the Libertarians at this point.
[00:52:13.871 --> 00:52:15.972]  Run your campaign, that's good.
[00:52:15.972 --> 00:52:16.952]  I respect that.
[00:52:16.952 --> 00:52:18.572]  I understand why the third party exists.
[00:52:18.572 --> 00:52:22.393]  I understand why people don't want to trust Republicans and Democrats.
[00:52:22.393 --> 00:52:23.533]  And so they go third party.
[00:52:23.533 --> 00:52:24.314]  Totally get it.
[00:52:24.314 --> 00:52:26.234]  Totally legitimate.
[00:52:26.234 --> 00:52:31.776]  But then for the Libertarian to puff their chest out and say, ha ha ha ha, Republicans, you couldn't beat Democrats.
[00:52:31.776 --> 00:52:34.736]  Ha ha, Republicans, you couldn't put any good candidates up.
[00:52:34.736 --> 00:52:36.997]  Coming from the party that's never won a single election.
[00:52:36.997 --> 00:52:37.437]  Give me a break.
[00:52:39.318 --> 00:52:41.400]  Puffing your chest out.
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:58.739]  Because really, I think the Libertarian leadership knows that in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania, where the Libertarian vote could have put the Republican over the edge, and instead a Democrat gun-grabber, tax-raiser got in, I think they genuinely feel bad about it, and so their copium is to sit here and point at Republicans and lash out.
[00:53:00.191 --> 00:53:14.916]  But no, the Libertarian Party should have dropped out of their races, endorsed the Republican candidates, even saying, hey, we don't really like the Republicans, they've done X, Y, and Z, but you know what, they align closer to our values with Democrats, and we don't want to elect Democrat gun grabbers and tax raisers.
[00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:19.237]  No, instead they said, haha, Republicans, you couldn't even beat Democrats, you put up banned candidates.
[00:53:22.515 --> 00:53:24.377]  But see, this is the way.
[00:53:24.377 --> 00:53:29.883]  The populist movement, hostile takeover, politically, of the Republican Party.
[00:53:29.883 --> 00:53:31.464]  That's what needs to happen.
[00:53:31.464 --> 00:53:33.166]  We've already got a beachhead in.
[00:53:33.166 --> 00:53:34.748]  We've already got a reformation in.
[00:53:34.748 --> 00:53:36.710]  We've already got the people behind us.
[00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:42.516]  This is the way, I believe.
[00:53:42.516 --> 00:53:45.519]  Even the left-wing media now is coming after Biden.
[00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:52.444]  Salon, Biden was the biggest negative for Democrats in midterms, would be a disaster in 2024.
[00:53:52.444 --> 00:53:54.465]  You know, this is hilarious.
[00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:59.489]  This is more liberal Democrat doublespeak that they just get away with and don't even think twice about it.
[00:53:59.489 --> 00:54:00.990]  Oh, Biden's so great!
[00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:02.531]  Biden saved the economy!
[00:54:02.531 --> 00:54:03.231]  Biden great!
[00:54:03.231 --> 00:54:03.872]  Biden this!
[00:54:03.872 --> 00:54:04.392]  Biden that!
[00:54:04.392 --> 00:54:06.073]  They tell you how great everything is.
[00:54:06.073 --> 00:54:10.176]  And then, in the next conversation, they tell you what a disaster he is and he shouldn't run in 2024.
[00:54:10.176 --> 00:54:10.796]  Which isn't liberals!
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.421]  Which is it, Democrats?
[00:54:15.421 --> 00:54:16.381]  84 million votes?
[00:54:16.381 --> 00:54:17.782]  Most popular of all time?
[00:54:17.782 --> 00:54:18.843]  Saving the economy?
[00:54:18.843 --> 00:54:20.204]  Saving the country?
[00:54:20.204 --> 00:54:22.565]  Returning us to normal?
[00:54:22.565 --> 00:54:23.806]  Which is it?
[00:54:23.806 --> 00:54:27.528]  Which is true about Joe Biden?
[00:54:27.528 --> 00:54:28.428]  84 million votes?
[00:54:28.428 --> 00:54:29.509]  Saving the country?
[00:54:29.509 --> 00:54:32.471]  Or a complete disaster and shouldn't run again?
[00:54:32.471 --> 00:54:33.992]  Which is it, Democrats?
[00:54:33.992 --> 00:54:34.772]  Well, it's both!
[00:54:34.772 --> 00:54:36.453]  They don't need logical consistency!
[00:54:37.751 --> 00:54:39.092]  They're Democrats.
[00:54:39.092 --> 00:54:39.953]  They're liberals.
[00:54:39.953 --> 00:54:41.274]  They're mentally deranged.
[00:54:41.274 --> 00:54:42.655]  They have mental disorders.
[00:54:42.655 --> 00:54:45.498]  Now they're even doing specials with Michelle Obama!
[00:54:45.498 --> 00:54:47.379]  They're dusting off that old thing!
[00:54:47.379 --> 00:54:54.845]  And they're doing specials where she talks about how she's going through depression and how she has all these mental disorders.
[00:54:54.845 --> 00:54:57.548]  Oh, you don't say!
[00:54:57.548 --> 00:55:00.550]  Liberalism is literally a mental disorder.
[00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.612]  They've had studies out for years
[00:55:03.579 --> 00:55:07.021]  Half of liberals have been diagnosed with a mental disorder.
[00:55:07.021 --> 00:55:08.923]  Diagnosed!
[00:55:08.923 --> 00:55:10.544]  Diagnosed!
[00:55:10.544 --> 00:55:14.806]  Another half probably have it and just haven't been diagnosed!
[00:55:14.806 --> 00:55:17.968]  So yeah, liberals don't need logical consistency.
[00:55:17.968 --> 00:55:20.350]  Liberals can have double think, double speak all day long.
[00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.651]  Biden, 84 million votes saving the country.
[00:55:22.651 --> 00:55:25.613]  Biden, complete disaster during the midterms, needs to go.
[00:55:25.613 --> 00:55:26.754]  Which one is it, liberals?
[00:55:26.754 --> 00:55:28.355]  Doesn't matter.
[00:55:28.355 --> 00:55:29.396]  They lie for a living.
[00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:32.222]  You think a little double standard?
[00:55:32.222 --> 00:55:33.242]  You think a little double think?
[00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:34.963]  A little double talk?
[00:55:34.963 --> 00:55:35.723]  Gonna bother them?
[00:55:35.723 --> 00:55:38.584]  Heck no!
[00:55:38.584 --> 00:55:39.885]  But see, here's where it gets interesting.
[00:55:39.885 --> 00:55:42.906]  The entire establishment is coming after Trump again.
[00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:44.727]  And I'll just say this.
[00:55:44.727 --> 00:55:48.668]  In the dream world... Because here's the problem, though.
[00:55:48.668 --> 00:55:50.189]  You can't assume anything in the future.
[00:55:50.189 --> 00:55:57.712]  But... In the dream world... I think the best way to go about this...
[00:55:59.548 --> 00:56:06.050]  Taking things at as much of face value as you as you can, which is almost zero.
[00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:14.852]  But for the sake of this argument, I think the ideal situation is Trump 2024 should win.
[00:56:14.852 --> 00:56:18.473]  And then DeSantis 2028.
[00:56:18.473 --> 00:56:26.415]  And now you're looking at at least eight or 12 years of Republican Party rule.
[00:56:26.415 --> 00:56:27.755]  That will boom the economy.
[00:56:28.937 --> 00:56:34.098]  Take care of the southern border and just get us back on the right track.
[00:56:34.098 --> 00:56:37.219]  And so that's why the entire establishment is coming after Trump right now.
[00:56:37.219 --> 00:56:41.080]  Nancy Pelosi says a Trump 2024 bid would be bad news for the country.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.361]  Oh, my support of Trump just goes up a little bit.
[00:56:44.361 --> 00:56:47.581]  Trump wanted IRS investigation of his foes.
[00:56:47.581 --> 00:56:50.782]  TopAid says, whoa!
[00:56:50.782 --> 00:56:54.083]  Trump support goes up even more.
[00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.934]  Yeah, you're damn right that these politicians in this country need to be investigated by the IRS.
[00:56:58.934 --> 00:57:01.736]  They're going after Trump, why not everybody else?
[00:57:01.736 --> 00:57:03.577]  They're the real criminals!
[00:57:03.577 --> 00:57:08.261]  Mike Pence to David Muir and ABC.
[00:57:08.261 --> 00:57:11.703]  Trump's words on January 6th endangered me and my family and everyone at the Capitol.
[00:57:11.703 --> 00:57:12.584]  Oh, okay, Mike Pence.
[00:57:12.584 --> 00:57:13.845]  Stab him in the back.
[00:57:13.845 --> 00:57:15.646]  Now I like Trump even more.
[00:57:15.646 --> 00:57:17.047]  New York Post with the Murdochs.
[00:57:17.047 --> 00:57:19.729]  They continue to publish anti-Trump news every day.
[00:57:19.729 --> 00:57:20.329]  Boer.
[00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:22.451]  Donald Trump has gone and lost his swing.
[00:57:23.726 --> 00:57:28.489]  So now the Republican establishment, the media establishment, the Democrat Party all coming for Trump.
[00:57:28.489 --> 00:57:34.032]  And boy oh boy, despite his shortcomings and problems, every time they swing at him, my support for him goes up.
[00:57:39.082 --> 00:57:43.427]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[00:57:43.427 --> 00:57:54.639]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:07.352]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[00:58:07.352 --> 00:58:10.556]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are
[00:58:10.996 --> 00:58:14.540]  Incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.
[00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.422]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:58:16.422 --> 00:58:17.683]  Black Friday comes early.

[00:58:25.932 --> 00:58:26.873]  Biggest sale of the year.
[00:58:26.873 --> 00:58:28.555]  Promo code 1776.
[00:58:28.555 --> 00:58:29.676]  Up to 60% off.

[00:58:36.403 --> 00:58:38.906]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[00:58:38.906 --> 00:58:40.187]  Why is this taking so long?
[00:58:40.187 --> 00:58:43.650]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:44.991]  Why can't we do this here?
[00:58:44.991 --> 00:58:47.473]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[00:58:47.473 --> 00:58:53.339]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[00:58:53.499 --> 00:58:55.321]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[00:58:55.321 --> 00:58:57.223]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[00:58:57.223 --> 00:58:59.145]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[00:58:59.145 --> 00:59:08.916]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single state.
[00:59:08.916 --> 00:59:11.118]  We need more of this communication, not less.
[00:59:39.239 --> 00:59:41.920]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:15.943]  ...resilience of the message of the Democratic Party... ...with the United States of America...
[01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:18.188]  No, I'm not joking.
[01:00:18.188 --> 01:00:22.870]  A democratic platform that said your increasing poverty doesn't exist.
[01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:26.472]  But what they've done is they've taught people the word inflation, right?
[01:00:26.472 --> 01:00:31.054]  Most people who have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now because they've been taught it.
[01:00:31.054 --> 01:00:32.834]  Those machete attacks.
[01:00:32.834 --> 01:00:38.697]  In Malibu, this homeless man was recently arrested after attacking a man with a machete.
[01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:41.518]  Daylight homicides and subway rapes.
[01:00:41.518 --> 01:00:43.038]  The attack was brutal.
[01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:46.680]  It was wicked and the worst part is when the people were watching.
[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.102]  Well, they never happen.
[01:00:48.102 --> 01:00:48.943]  Anyone who commits a crime...
[01:01:01.972 --> 01:01:06.055]  Under our laws, especially with the changes we made to bail, has consequences.
[01:01:06.055 --> 01:01:07.615]  I don't know why that's so important.
[01:01:07.615 --> 01:01:12.839]  We will make owning a home and retirement impossible for subsequent generations.
[01:01:12.839 --> 01:01:15.400]  When I was born, the median price for a house was $108,900.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:15.780]  Now it's $337,200.
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.581]  Even if you account for inflation, that's about a 45% increase in cost.
[01:01:27.367 --> 01:01:34.037]  The overwhelming evidence of vaccine deaths and injuries are a figment of your conspiratorial imagination.
[01:01:34.037 --> 01:01:36.780]  And we're here with a simple message.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.304]  Get vaccinated.
[01:01:39.304 --> 01:01:40.726]  Update your COVID vaccine.
[01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:45.825]  Something like one in a thousand people have died.
[01:01:45.825 --> 01:01:47.987]  We don't know how many more will die.
[01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:52.491]  But we're into double figures of millions who have definitely been killed as a consequence of this policy.
[01:01:52.491 --> 01:02:03.102]  I've not been a religious person, but I'm absolutely clear in my mind the only people, the kind of planning and thinking it takes to have done what has happened, are people who would worship Satan.
[01:02:03.682 --> 01:02:06.524]  This was the Democrats' message.
[01:02:06.524 --> 01:02:15.031]  What factors led to this train wreck of the Corporocratic District of Criminals Country Club Mirage of our Constitutional Republic?
[01:02:15.031 --> 01:02:19.074]  Can you comment on the alleged allegations of your connection with Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:23.755]  Was there a generational factor?
[01:02:23.755 --> 01:02:29.016]  Gen Z, the 18-29 age group, gave 28 points to the Democrats.
[01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:44.939]  Swayed by the fear-mongering, Gen Z was more than happy to trade what's left of their future to their Marxist-Boomer counterparts who promised them student loan forgiveness and will now wag slavery in the form of universal basic income in their faces.
[01:02:44.939 --> 01:02:47.159]  Have you thought about where this is heading?
[01:02:47.159 --> 01:02:49.760]  This is heading to you having no life.
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:56.804]  To you spending your income on needs rather than treats and desires.
[01:02:56.804 --> 01:03:00.026]  Because you won't have any spare money left for those.
[01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.848]  They don't view you like a human being, these people.
[01:03:03.848 --> 01:03:09.452]  What we've got left is a government that's a middle management team for some higher power.
[01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:14.595]  And I think ultimately we will have to have some kind of universal basic income.
[01:03:15.169 --> 01:03:21.551]  Middle and working classes will be eroded and replaced with robots, AI and big corporations.
[01:03:21.551 --> 01:03:25.752]  And given a basic income, the old world is not coming back.
[01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:31.634]  A group of billionaires are deciding how the rest of the world should live, and they have the ear of the government that claims to represent you.
[01:03:32.174 --> 01:03:38.217]  The abortion factor saw 37 points go to the Democrats from unwed mothers.
[01:03:38.217 --> 01:03:44.340]  And did Trump's shadow loom too large over a Republican party rising from his ashes?
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:54.965]  Or are these merely excuses to distract the CNN exit polls results that revealed that 75% of voters said the country is on the wrong track?
[01:03:55.245 --> 01:03:59.691]  An overwhelming majority are angry about inflation and the economy.
[01:03:59.691 --> 01:04:12.989]  Biden and company will now ramp up the threats on anyone with an unshakable gut feeling after they witnessed once again the blatant, antiquated, and openly rigged, quote, incompetent, end quote, voting system.
[01:04:13.189 --> 01:04:17.272]  So you're telling me I should vote John Fetterman, I should vote Joshua Shapiro?
[01:04:17.272 --> 01:04:20.174]  You vote the Democrats, all of them are the Democrats.
[01:04:20.174 --> 01:04:22.315]  You only got one against one.
[01:04:22.315 --> 01:04:31.041]  Project Veritas Action journalists were told who to vote for just mere feet outside a polling center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today.
[01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:34.223]  This is referred to as electioneering.
[01:04:34.223 --> 01:04:36.944]  So you have to fill out the ballot properly.
[01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:42.788]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the full John Bowne report can be found at band.video.
[01:04:42.788 --> 01:04:45.570]  Where the audience is growing folks, this is the mothership.

[01:05:12.294 --> 01:05:14.696]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.

[01:05:22.859 --> 01:05:26.022]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[01:05:59.547 --> 01:06:02.168]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:02.168 --> 01:06:07.731]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:10.632]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:24.837 --> 01:06:46.150]  Alright, we are now joined by Matt Baker, slave to liberty, and he is out in Arizona, Maricopa County, and he was boots on the ground talking to voters out at polling locations, so I just wanted to bring him on today, talk about what he learned, what voters are saying, what's the vibe there, boots on the ground.
[01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:47.931]  Matt Baker, give us the breakdown.
[01:06:50.077 --> 01:06:51.618]  Well, it's not good, Owen.
[01:06:51.618 --> 01:06:55.639]  I mean, Arizona out here has been a very red area.
[01:06:55.639 --> 01:07:05.222]  I mean, a lot of people moved from California to escape California, not to come here and build a new California, but to actually escape all of the crazy leftist wackness.
[01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.903]  I'm actually here at my buddy's house.
[01:07:06.903 --> 01:07:09.103]  I built this fireplace behind me.
[01:07:09.103 --> 01:07:13.985]  And he's very well on the red side, and everyone around here is.
[01:07:13.985 --> 01:07:16.886]  Most people are very, almost like Texans.
[01:07:16.886 --> 01:07:18.046]  They've got pickup trucks.
[01:07:18.046 --> 01:07:18.787]  They've got guns.
[01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:22.774]  Everybody's, uh... Everybody's really, uh, very, uh...
[01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:31.095]  You know, it's funny that you say that because, you know, I'm sitting here in Texas looking at the Democrat after it turned Texas blue.
[01:07:31.095 --> 01:07:32.276]  I was proud of Texas.
[01:07:32.276 --> 01:07:32.937]  We showed out.
[01:07:32.937 --> 01:07:34.458]  We didn't let Beto win.
[01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:39.041]  But I mean, I was sitting here kind of looking like, okay, if Beto gets in, I don't know if I can live in this state anymore.
[01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:40.622]  That's how bad it was.
[01:07:40.622 --> 01:07:43.044]  And I'm thinking like, Arizona looks pretty good.
[01:07:43.044 --> 01:07:46.326]  Arizona's looking like it's going red, looking like good leadership.
[01:07:46.326 --> 01:07:49.869]  But no, no, it looks like the Democrats are trying to stomp that out.
[01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:51.828]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:51.828 --> 01:08:02.477]  Like, I mean, it's very hot out here, so I live in the perfect climate of California, which is the breeding ground of why they can get away with so much crap in California, because they know people don't really want to leave.
[01:08:02.477 --> 01:08:04.719]  Now, out here, they can say, hey, come over here.
[01:08:04.719 --> 01:08:08.703]  We've got all these great laws and we're not a bunch of leftist scumbags.
[01:08:08.703 --> 01:08:14.528]  And so people were moving out here and dealing with the high temperatures and the high electric bills from cooling their houses.
[01:08:14.528 --> 01:08:16.470]  But I got to tell you, the place is really nice.
[01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:18.051]  The idea that they can't vote
[01:08:18.723 --> 01:08:20.866]  Count these votes is absolutely ridiculous.
[01:08:20.866 --> 01:08:23.951]  The infrastructure here is like some of the best I've seen around.
[01:08:23.951 --> 01:08:25.794]  Like, the roads are perfect.
[01:08:25.794 --> 01:08:26.455]  Yeah, very new.
[01:08:26.455 --> 01:08:27.436]  A lot of new infrastructure.
[01:08:27.436 --> 01:08:27.937]  It's beautiful.
[01:08:28.453 --> 01:08:38.741]  Yeah, it's not like they're trying to gather, you know, votes from old Mary Sue's, you know, chicken coop and bring them on down the road to Bob's, you know, you know, little shack and count them.
[01:08:38.741 --> 01:08:41.763]  I mean, they have beautiful infrastructure, beautiful roads.
[01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:46.767]  I mean, the idea that they can't pull this off like a first world is absolutely BS.
[01:08:46.767 --> 01:08:50.990]  And the only reason, as we all know, is because they're going to challenge until they win.
[01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.531]  You know, it's just absolute crap.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:09:00.807]  So what are people on the ground saying about their experience voting with any of the anomalies, the machine breakdowns?
[01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:03.910]  I mean, what's the word from the people on the streets when you talk to them?
[01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:11.799]  Well, I've met several people that have said that they had trouble getting their vote to scan and it was put into so-called box three.
[01:09:11.799 --> 01:09:18.404]  And then these votes have to be, I think they're called healed, because then they have to go through and check them for signatures and this and that.
[01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:23.708]  The problem is the human beings who are then now in charge of counting those votes in these different precincts.
[01:09:24.304 --> 01:09:41.919]  I actually, it's funny after our little chat the other day, I haven't listened to Michael Savage in a long time, but I just turned into him the other day and he had this amazing thing on about how the voting machines can be made to swing one way or another simply by just making the sensitivity of the camera for the dot.
[01:09:41.919 --> 01:09:46.423]  If you say, it's gotta be above this resolution or below that resolution.
[01:09:46.423 --> 01:09:51.968]  If they tweak that in the different counties to make it more sensitive, it kicks out more ballots.
[01:09:52.268 --> 01:10:01.399]  And it sounds like we were listening to the same podcast, because it also talks about how they can use these little tweaks, like for example the felt pen, right?
[01:10:01.399 --> 01:10:10.050]  And then the machine doesn't read it correctly, and then a human has to count it, and oh, if there's no oversight of that human, all of a sudden they can just mark those ballots however they want!
[01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:15.057]  Yeah, and then they inevitably do it in these Democratic centers.
[01:10:15.057 --> 01:10:26.287]  If you go downtown, the place that I went, I don't know if you see the rest of that video, right around the corner from this counting place is this massive Sheriff's Department, which literally looks like a battleship.
[01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:29.229]  The front of it is coming at you, it's very dystopian.
[01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:33.192]  And then one block from there is the largest homeless encampment.
[01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:36.836]  I don't know, maybe I've seen as big in LA, but nothing quite like this.
[01:10:36.836 --> 01:10:39.418]  Because usually in LA, there'll be a street,
[01:10:40.158 --> 01:10:41.659]  That you know goes on and on forever.
[01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:51.461]  This is like a full on like blocks and blocks with cross streets and like a whole area of a slot meet of homeless people with like pigeons eating trash off the street.
[01:10:51.461 --> 01:10:55.022]  People yelling and screaming at you if you slow down to like videotape and stuff.
[01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:56.182]  I get it was scary.
[01:10:56.182 --> 01:10:58.223]  I mean, it was block after block.
[01:10:58.223 --> 01:11:06.105]  And like I say, cross streets and not your normal one in a row people on a street like it was like six deep tents.
[01:11:06.665 --> 01:11:09.487]  All the way down the street and cross street, cross street, cross street.
[01:11:09.487 --> 01:11:13.190]  So the liberals have already taken control of this area.
[01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:14.591]  I was joking with my girlfriend.
[01:11:14.591 --> 01:11:16.853]  I was like, hey, well now they've taken control.
[01:11:16.853 --> 01:11:18.734]  Pretty soon you're going to start seeing homeless people.
[01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:20.896]  I guess I just wasn't in the right area.
[01:11:20.896 --> 01:11:34.906]  And so this area that they are doing the vote counting, as you can see, has been infected with this liberal scum concept that it's a good idea to have people living on the streets in squalor as part of their human rights or something.
[01:11:35.365 --> 01:11:36.730]  Wow, that's amazing.
[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:39.159]  I never had seen this type of footage from Arizona.
[01:11:40.092 --> 01:11:41.013]  You know, it's odd.
[01:11:41.013 --> 01:11:43.895]  You think about the homeless phenomenon that's extremely sad.
[01:11:43.895 --> 01:11:46.937]  I mean, people die in Chicago, they die in D.C.
[01:11:46.937 --> 01:11:48.178]  in the Northeast when they're homeless.
[01:11:48.178 --> 01:11:53.322]  You're wondering why they're homeless in these cold cities, why they don't end up in Arizona, but that's a whole other story.
[01:11:53.322 --> 01:11:58.766]  Now, I have been saying here that I don't expect there to be much of a fight in Nevada.
[01:11:58.766 --> 01:12:00.867]  I don't expect there to be much of a fight in Georgia.
[01:12:00.867 --> 01:12:03.769]  I don't think the Republicans have a spine, a backbone to fight there.
[01:12:03.769 --> 01:12:05.390]  But Arizona, I see it differently.
[01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.031]  I think that
[01:12:06.491 --> 01:12:10.832]  Fincham and Hamaday and Masters and Lake have a fight in them.
[01:12:10.832 --> 01:12:16.553]  And I think they got a nice, strong support base and group behind them as well that's going to fight.
[01:12:16.553 --> 01:12:19.374]  I know they got a legal team and everything that's going to fight.
[01:12:19.374 --> 01:12:20.995]  But where do you think that fight stands?
[01:12:20.995 --> 01:12:24.035]  I mean, they're still under the delusion that Carrie Lake is going to win.
[01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:25.856]  I'm quite frankly not.
[01:12:25.856 --> 01:12:29.136]  Even if she does, the whole thing still needs to be investigated.
[01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:34.618]  Where do you think the fight stands in Arizona right now, almost a week after the election?
[01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.258]  They're still counting.
[01:12:36.906 --> 01:12:44.353]  Well, I do think that they're gonna magically find out that Katie Hobbs won, of course.
[01:12:44.353 --> 01:12:52.060]  They say that Kerry Lake is gonna have to get 58% of the remaining, still 100,000 votes are actually out.
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:58.506]  And apparently, a lot of these were the same day drop off ballots, where apparently you vote early but you drop off.
[01:12:59.128 --> 01:13:09.377]  And I found this interesting statistic, 88% of all the votes were early ballots, mail-in or early drop-off ballots, 88%.
[01:13:09.377 --> 01:13:22.069]  And when you consider that before COVID, that wasn't a thing unless you had to be out of the state, you had to be sick, you had to get a specific ballot, you had to apply to vote not in person and not on the day.
[01:13:22.729 --> 01:13:30.556]  A lot of the local patriots were complaining that I had seen some footage of that were at that ballot location area the day before.
[01:13:30.556 --> 01:13:31.637]  One was quite articulate.
[01:13:31.637 --> 01:13:33.979]  He kept on mentioning they had a bill.
[01:13:33.979 --> 01:13:41.225]  It was HB 2289, which was going to make it to what was only in person voting on the day of.
[01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:47.210]  And it was going to limit it down to only people who are in the military or people who
[01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:53.628]  Are in hospital or something of that nature to where they physically cannot show up and vote.
[01:13:53.628 --> 01:13:56.649]  And apparently one of the senators, what's her name?
[01:13:56.649 --> 01:13:59.870]  Wendy Rogers was supposed to be on board with that.
[01:13:59.870 --> 01:14:03.130]  And she actually called for this protest and then didn't even show up.
[01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:10.192]  And when the local sheriff threatened her with the bill for all the extra police he was going to have to bring in because it was dangerous.
[01:14:10.894 --> 01:14:16.297]  Then she basically called them off and they were all sitting there like idiots in the street going, what did you do?
[01:14:16.297 --> 01:14:17.057]  You called us here.
[01:14:17.057 --> 01:14:19.078]  It's kind of reminiscent of the Trump thing.
[01:14:19.078 --> 01:14:21.279]  You call us here and then you hang us out to dry.
[01:14:21.279 --> 01:14:21.860]  You know what I mean?
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:22.240]  Interesting.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:36.607]  So this Wendy Rogers didn't back the SB 2289, even though apparently they had the signatures to have, and it was all, they had the votes apparently in the signatures to at least put it on the ballot and get it to move forward so that they could have
[01:14:38.889 --> 01:14:46.553]  Real elections, I think maybe Florida may be able to maintain because it's almost too late for some of these areas.
[01:14:46.553 --> 01:14:52.516]  You're saying, we should get an electoral college for the states, which I think was an amazing idea that you had.
[01:14:52.516 --> 01:14:57.339]  However, those states are already run by Democrats and they're gonna be like, yeah, we're good, we don't need that.
[01:14:57.339 --> 01:14:59.220]  What about voting on the same day?
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:00.140]  No, we're good.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.962]  What they're gonna do, and I think I've actually
[01:15:03.556 --> 01:15:04.916]  I read that they've already started doing this.
[01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:06.637]  They're going to lower the voting age.
[01:15:06.637 --> 01:15:07.357]  That's what they're going to do.
[01:15:07.357 --> 01:15:08.558]  They're going to lower the voting age?
[01:15:08.558 --> 01:15:09.418]  Yeah, they'd like to do that.
[01:15:09.418 --> 01:15:11.338]  Yeah, it's not going to work, but yeah, they'll try.
[01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:14.799]  Well, when they run everything, we'll see.
[01:15:14.799 --> 01:15:16.280]  They'll be like, oh, you voted for it.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.341]  Turns out, Owen Troyer actually likes the idea.
[01:15:18.341 --> 01:15:20.641]  He voted for it.
[01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:24.282]  Yeah, and so did the dog that, you know, that died 12 years ago.
[01:15:24.282 --> 01:15:27.103]  And your dead grandmother, too.
[01:15:27.103 --> 01:15:28.124]  She's on board.
[01:15:28.124 --> 01:15:29.244]  Well, you know how it goes.
[01:15:29.244 --> 01:15:29.444]  I mean,
[01:15:30.675 --> 01:15:37.300]  You know, God love, uh, God love my grandmother and, um, she, she voted Republican every day till the day she died.
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.722]  Now she's voted Democrat in the last four elections.
[01:15:40.722 --> 01:15:42.783]  You know, it's amazing from the grave.
[01:15:42.783 --> 01:15:44.244]  My grandma would dare do that to me.
[01:15:44.244 --> 01:15:47.347]  Of course, the joke is we know all the dead people vote Democrat.
[01:15:47.347 --> 01:15:47.867]  It's amazing.
[01:15:47.867 --> 01:15:50.169]  You go, you want to go find a Democrat rally.
[01:15:50.169 --> 01:15:56.493]  Just go to your nearest graveyard, you know, and you'll find it.
[01:15:56.493 --> 01:15:57.734]  Your voice counts.

[01:18:09.707 --> 01:18:12.331]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[01:18:12.331 --> 01:18:15.855]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[01:18:16.255 --> 01:18:18.938]  But it helps every cellular function of the body.
[01:18:18.938 --> 01:18:26.064]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[01:18:26.064 --> 01:18:28.666]  Essential means without these things you die.
[01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:30.728]  And so much of the food is debased.
[01:18:30.728 --> 01:18:32.629]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:36.773]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[01:18:36.773 --> 01:18:38.995]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:43.667]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[01:18:57.263 --> 01:19:07.951]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:09.413]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:19:09.413 --> 01:19:10.914]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.635]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:19:12.635 --> 01:19:13.916]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.317]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:20.582]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:19:20.582 --> 01:19:22.964]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[01:19:22.964 --> 01:19:24.986]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:19:24.986 --> 01:19:31.933]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[01:19:32.555 --> 01:19:37.957]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:19:37.957 --> 01:19:46.900]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, for you to double your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:57.724]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:19:57.724 --> 01:20:00.365]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.319 --> 01:20:24.823]  I believe there's going to be a battle for Arizona.
[01:20:24.823 --> 01:20:33.253]  I don't think we're going to get the results we want, but I do think there's going to be calls for audits, recounts, review of the law, the voting process, everything.
[01:20:33.988 --> 01:20:40.315]  Because the Republicans in Arizona, Kerry Lake, Blake Masters, Mark Fincham, Abe Hamaday, they have a fight in them.
[01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:41.997]  They have a will in them.
[01:20:41.997 --> 01:20:43.218]  I don't see that in Nevada.
[01:20:43.218 --> 01:20:44.379]  I don't see that in Georgia.
[01:20:44.379 --> 01:20:47.883]  It's gone and dead in Pennsylvania and Michigan, sadly.
[01:20:50.026 --> 01:20:53.168]  Now, maybe that can change, but that's the way I see it right now.
[01:20:53.168 --> 01:21:02.192]  And you were mentioning in the last segment, Matt Baker with us, Slave to Liberty, you were mentioning the rally where Wendy Rogers invited people out and then didn't show.
[01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:06.074]  Not sure what was going on with that, but I'm seeing that there are multiple rallies.
[01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:11.257]  There's been a lot of on-the-street activism, a lot of on-the-street rallying and protesting in Arizona.
[01:21:11.257 --> 01:21:12.457]  Nowhere else.
[01:21:12.457 --> 01:21:15.038]  In Brazil, they're out by the millions.
[01:21:15.038 --> 01:21:17.860]  In Arizona, they're out by maybe the hundreds or the thousands.
[01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:19.671]  But what about that?
[01:21:19.671 --> 01:21:24.173]  What about the people, because a lot of these videos are making their way around the internet.
[01:21:24.173 --> 01:21:29.215]  People saying, we don't trust the election, it was rigged, I went to vote, it didn't work, the machine shut down.
[01:21:29.215 --> 01:21:42.061]  So what do you make of the street activism and what do you make of the Republican candidates and how do you think this fight is going to go in the coming weeks when they finally declare that not a single Republican won in Arizona?
[01:21:44.904 --> 01:21:46.626]  Well, they're going to have to take it to court.
[01:21:46.626 --> 01:21:49.348]  The problem is, is who's going to be the judge?
[01:21:49.348 --> 01:21:59.097]  And they already, when the votes were getting kicked out of the machines, they already called the judge and said, shouldn't we have some extra time to have people vote?
[01:21:59.097 --> 01:22:06.785]  Because a lot of these people weren't able to vote because they were in line and they got told to go home because the machines either didn't have paperwork or they weren't counting the votes.
[01:22:06.785 --> 01:22:07.846]  And then the judge said,
[01:22:08.226 --> 01:22:09.787]  Well, we're good.
[01:22:09.787 --> 01:22:10.728]  We're doing fine.
[01:22:10.728 --> 01:22:14.171]  And so when they come and they say, hey, what about these voting anomalies?
[01:22:14.171 --> 01:22:15.212]  What are they going to do?
[01:22:15.212 --> 01:22:16.953]  Just say, well, we're good.
[01:22:16.953 --> 01:22:20.276]  So I mean, in the end, I think it really is up to the people.
[01:22:20.276 --> 01:22:25.860]  And we're going to have to do even better than these small gatherings that have been out there.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:30.925]  I believe that in Arizona, there's a heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy contingent of right wing people.
[01:22:31.957 --> 01:22:37.184]  You have no idea what you're in for once you think it's just, oh, it's red, it's blue.
[01:22:37.184 --> 01:22:38.826]  No, this isn't going to be a big problem.
[01:22:38.826 --> 01:22:46.736]  Like your kids are going to be getting told about transgender stuff and the race, you know, the critical race theory is going to be pushed hard.
[01:22:46.736 --> 01:22:49.720]  My buddy who I'm here for, he, I used to work on his house.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.443]  In San Diego and he left because he couldn't deal with the schools in San Diego.
[01:22:54.443 --> 01:22:58.426]  Now he's out there left as a refugee on this beautiful house.
[01:22:58.426 --> 01:23:01.349]  We're fixing it up and now politics is going to change.
[01:23:01.349 --> 01:23:04.171]  He's going to be basically without a country because
[01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:10.839]  You know, his kids are now going to be, this stuff's going to start infiltrating into the schools and, you know, the economy.
[01:23:10.839 --> 01:23:15.120]  And I wouldn't be surprised if the housing market might actually take a hit.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.161]  I shouldn't say that because he doesn't want his house price to go down.
[01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:24.202]  But I mean, a lot of people might be considering moving out now and where to go because this wads the haven from the West Coast.
[01:23:24.202 --> 01:23:27.383]  I mean, the West Coast now, you pretty much got nowhere to run to.
[01:23:27.383 --> 01:23:32.364]  You know, if you don't go to Texas or Florida, I mean, I don't I don't know what your what your plan is at this point.
[01:23:33.424 --> 01:23:42.908]  Anyone who is in red states or even a tiny town, you have to make laws to make sure that the counting gets done.
[01:23:42.908 --> 01:23:45.309]  Don't just say, oh, that's been done forever and it's okay.
[01:23:45.309 --> 01:23:54.192]  Cuz no, they're gonna get a Democrat weirdo in there and they're gonna start taking over that little town and they're probably gonna use money from these crypto Ponzi schemes that they have around the world to
[01:23:54.412 --> 01:23:54.653]  I don't
[01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:18.432]  Tyranny is just that the free money and the Ponzi scheme and the money laundering is basically the fuel for tyranny.
[01:24:18.432 --> 01:24:19.732]  And it just keeps pushing it.
[01:24:19.732 --> 01:24:24.134]  It buys off local towns, local judges, local mayors.
[01:24:24.134 --> 01:24:27.095]  So you have to hold the line in any place that you have.
[01:24:27.095 --> 01:24:28.576]  You still have a voice.
[01:24:28.576 --> 01:24:32.297]  You have to make sure like they did in Florida to pass laws saying you can't vote.
[01:24:32.297 --> 01:24:34.018]  We need voter IDs.
[01:24:34.018 --> 01:24:35.318]  We need voting on the same day.
[01:24:35.318 --> 01:24:40.400]  We need people to actually make sure that they're the real people who are actually voting, that they're qualified to vote.
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.184]  You know, I mean, you have to do everything you can to save these remaining areas.
[01:24:45.184 --> 01:24:50.628]  And if we can possibly flip some of these other areas back in these smaller areas that they're not paying attention to.
[01:24:50.628 --> 01:24:55.292]  One thing I gotta say is people, we always say on that right, we're like, Democrats are dumb.
[01:24:55.292 --> 01:25:00.597]  No, the Democrat foot soldiers are dumb because they believe whatever their overlords tell them.
[01:25:00.597 --> 01:25:06.302]  The people that run the Democrat Party are the most conniving, manipulative scumbags ever to walk the earth.
[01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:06.782]  And that's why.
[01:25:06.782 --> 01:25:08.844]  They're very politically savvy criminally, yes.
[01:25:10.285 --> 01:25:17.630]  And I think to get back to what we were saying the other day about DeSantis, and by the way, I love you Laura, I was a little bit heated the other day about that.
[01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:23.894]  But I think we gotta be very careful when we talk about the Trump-DeSantis thing.
[01:25:23.894 --> 01:25:30.718]  Because for all we know, they're just trying to push pressure on the base to now throw DeSantis under the bus.
[01:25:30.718 --> 01:25:34.881]  And then they come out and indict Trump, and then now who we got?
[01:25:34.881 --> 01:25:38.043]  When we know that DeSantis is a great candidate, we know Trump is a great candidate.
[01:25:38.303 --> 01:25:42.346]  We're all going to vote for whoever the right-wing candidate is.
[01:25:52.012 --> 01:25:55.074]  So if they battle it out, may the best man win.
[01:25:55.074 --> 01:26:05.099]  Now, if they can just do it without destroying each other's careers in the meantime, because they could very easily just have all right wing people I know are already going.
[01:26:05.099 --> 01:26:12.903]  They're doing all the opposition research to undermine him as a great candidate, which could be our only hope if Trump
[01:26:13.403 --> 01:26:17.365]  He gets defeated or taken out or jailed or something by the deep state.
[01:26:17.365 --> 01:26:20.546]  So once they get that in, we have to be very careful.
[01:26:20.546 --> 01:26:22.867]  Don't call names to our fellow candidates.
[01:26:22.867 --> 01:26:24.148]  Don't do anything.
[01:26:24.148 --> 01:26:28.050]  With anything, just say we'll support Trump for now, but DeSantis is a great person.
[01:26:28.050 --> 01:26:30.391]  And don't get in the weeds because we can't do it.
[01:26:30.391 --> 01:26:32.511]  Thank God DeSantis didn't buy onto that.
[01:26:32.511 --> 01:26:33.632]  Trump did.
[01:26:33.632 --> 01:26:35.093]  I mean, technically, I understand.
[01:26:35.093 --> 01:26:40.015]  If Trump did actually save DeSantis, then technically,
[01:26:43.056 --> 01:26:53.799]  Trump took the bait or he's chewing through the buffet of bait like Lizzo or something.
[01:26:53.799 --> 01:26:58.901]  But I think it might be a political strategy of his to just get this out of the way ahead of the primary process.
[01:26:59.261 --> 01:27:01.582]  To just come in swinging and say, all right, who wants to fight me?
[01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:02.322]  You want to fight me?
[01:27:02.322 --> 01:27:03.123]  We're going to fight for me.
[01:27:03.123 --> 01:27:05.024]  Because he wants to be the president.
[01:27:05.024 --> 01:27:07.945]  That shows me Trump really badly wants to be the president.
[01:27:07.945 --> 01:27:11.666]  That he's coming out swinging already, taking on the Republican establishment.
[01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:13.247]  He really wants to be president again.
[01:27:13.247 --> 01:27:15.908]  I think it's a good sign, even though it looked bad on the surface.
[01:27:15.908 --> 01:27:17.969]  Matt Baker, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:27:17.969 --> 01:27:19.550]  Great coverage as always.
[01:27:19.550 --> 01:27:22.531]  And you know, he mentioned another great point there too.
[01:27:22.531 --> 01:27:25.993]  The phenomenon of people leaving the Democrat cities, moving to Republican areas.
[01:27:25.993 --> 01:27:26.733]  It's like, how do they...
[01:27:27.483 --> 01:27:30.244]  I'm glad that didn't happen to Texas, but it's like, how does that happen to Arizona?
[01:27:30.244 --> 01:27:32.445]  That's another amazing phenomenon.
[01:27:32.445 --> 01:27:40.167]  Ladies and gentlemen, before we come back with our next great guest, Joe Hoff, remember InfoWarsTore.com is how we do everything we do here.
[01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:41.927]  We don't have big crypto scams.
[01:27:41.927 --> 01:27:44.028]  We don't have big billionaire donors like George Soros.
[01:27:44.028 --> 01:27:46.089]  We don't have big corporate sponsors, Hollywood sponsors.
[01:27:46.089 --> 01:27:52.151]  We have you shopping at InfoWarsTore.com for great products like Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:27:52.151 --> 01:27:53.591]  And I'm telling you, you look at this.
[01:27:53.591 --> 01:27:56.512]  I mean, I've got the supplement facts right here.
[01:27:57.808 --> 01:28:11.371]  Over a hundred percent of your daily value of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, biotin.
[01:28:11.371 --> 01:28:13.591]  I mean the list just goes on and on here.
[01:28:13.591 --> 01:28:18.412]  It's got thousand milligrams of glycine, hundred milligrams of glutamine.
[01:28:18.412 --> 01:28:21.312]  It's got the NAC in here as well.
[01:28:21.312 --> 01:28:22.293]  Coenzyme Q10.
[01:28:22.293 --> 01:28:23.933]  That's just an incredible elite
[01:28:24.711 --> 01:28:25.792]  Supplement right here.
[01:28:25.792 --> 01:28:26.992]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:28:26.992 --> 01:28:28.153]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:28.153 --> 01:28:31.614]  I start every day with Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:28:31.614 --> 01:28:33.895]  I like to mix it with a little juice.
[01:28:33.895 --> 01:28:37.117]  And then I chase down my supplements with Vitamin Mineral Fusion every morning.
[01:28:37.117 --> 01:28:38.457]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:38.457 --> 01:28:41.139]  Put a big pitcher in your refrigerator.
[01:28:41.139 --> 01:28:42.039]  The kids will love it.
[01:28:43.053 --> 01:28:54.824]  So many people say to me, Alex, please stop being so negative.
[01:28:54.824 --> 01:29:03.231]  Well, for me, admitting I've gotten a rotten tooth and going in a root canal is not negative.
[01:29:03.231 --> 01:29:06.654]  It hurts, it stinks, it's got pus coming out of it.
[01:29:06.654 --> 01:29:08.015]  I go to the doctor, they fix it.
[01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:09.096]  That's not negative.
[01:29:09.096 --> 01:29:09.957]  I'm not living in denial.
[01:29:10.891 --> 01:29:17.117]  And so think of globalism as being hidden, as an infection that we didn't feel yet, but now it's come to the surface.
[01:29:17.117 --> 01:29:19.119]  That's actually a positive thing.
[01:29:19.119 --> 01:29:21.422]  And so yeah, Trump did overall a great job.
[01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:22.723]  They stole the election.
[01:29:22.723 --> 01:29:24.505]  We can't get down about that.
[01:29:24.505 --> 01:29:27.368]  We have forced them out in the open.
[01:29:28.328 --> 01:29:31.670]  So now they're trying to suppress us because they know they've been exposed.
[01:29:31.670 --> 01:29:32.531]  They're scared.
[01:29:32.531 --> 01:29:35.933]  That's why, instead of saying, oh, we're a bunch of losers, look what happened.
[01:29:35.933 --> 01:29:37.234]  No, we're a bunch of winners.
[01:29:37.234 --> 01:29:38.515]  They're trying to suppress us.
[01:29:38.515 --> 01:29:42.597]  Let our light of truth shine and tell everybody what's happening.
[01:29:42.597 --> 01:29:46.280]  Your own website, your own show, my show, other articles, other videos.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:50.502]  Just keep sharing however you can and realize we're in an information war.

[01:29:58.624 --> 01:30:02.947]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:30:02.947 --> 01:30:14.576]  They are attacking, and suing, and censoring, and spying on, and engaging in bullying, and physical attacks against populists, conservatives, and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:30:14.576 --> 01:30:20.941]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars, because we know the globalists

[01:31:54.805 --> 01:31:57.289]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[01:31:57.289 --> 01:31:58.571]  Why is this taking so long?
[01:31:58.571 --> 01:32:02.055]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:32:02.055 --> 01:32:03.377]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:32:03.377 --> 01:32:05.881]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:32:05.881 --> 01:32:11.729]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[01:32:11.889 --> 01:32:13.712]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:32:13.712 --> 01:32:15.615]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:32:15.615 --> 01:32:17.538]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:27.193]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every city.
[01:32:27.193 --> 01:32:29.515]  We need more of this communication, not less.
[01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:00.301]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.506 --> 01:33:21.574]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.574 --> 01:33:25.158]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:25.158 --> 01:33:27.240]  Well, it's incredible, folks, as we sit here.
[01:33:28.445 --> 01:33:37.347]  They're still counting votes in Oregon, and California, and Colorado, and Maryland, in House races where Republicans have a stronghold and are winning.
[01:33:37.347 --> 01:33:42.068]  But magically, the perfect number of votes are coming in for the Democrats to win!
[01:33:42.068 --> 01:33:44.429]  And they might take the House, too!
[01:33:44.429 --> 01:33:45.629]  It's totally legitimate.
[01:33:45.629 --> 01:33:48.370]  Don't ask any questions or you're a racist terrorist bigot.
[01:33:49.378 --> 01:33:54.943]  Now, the great Joe Hoft from the incredible Gateway Pundit joins me here.
[01:33:54.943 --> 01:33:56.944]  They are just all over this story.
[01:33:56.944 --> 01:34:00.467]  Here's a couple of the headlines I want to open up here with Joe Hoft.
[01:34:00.467 --> 01:34:08.794]  Despite only 17% Democrat turnout on Election Day, Katie Hobbs and Democrats are winning over 50% of Maricopa County Election Day totals.
[01:34:08.794 --> 01:34:10.936]  Nobody thought that would be the case.
[01:34:10.936 --> 01:34:11.876]  And here we are.
[01:34:11.876 --> 01:34:17.061]  Maricopa County Election Judge believes the machines were programmed to reject ballots on Election Day.
[01:34:17.061 --> 01:34:18.642]  Hmm, I wonder whose ballots they were rejecting.
[01:34:19.822 --> 01:34:24.244]  And GOP didn't lose midterms because mail-in ballots are better than in-person voting.
[01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:27.466]  The GOP lost because the same corrupt election activities happened again.
[01:34:27.466 --> 01:34:31.047]  So I want to begin the conversation right here with Joe Hoff.
[01:34:31.047 --> 01:34:33.408]  Joe, it's an amazing thing.
[01:34:33.408 --> 01:34:35.709]  The Democrats don't have to have rallies.
[01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:36.970]  They don't have to campaign.
[01:34:36.970 --> 01:34:38.891]  They don't have to have debates.
[01:34:38.891 --> 01:34:40.232]  They don't have to do anything.
[01:34:40.232 --> 01:34:42.092]  And then somehow they win in Arizona.
[01:34:44.119 --> 01:34:45.680]  How obvious is this one?
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:50.804]  To me, it's a pretty obvious one because Arizona was a really energized red state.
[01:34:50.804 --> 01:34:58.529]  I mean, they were excited for their candidates, excited for this midterm election, and yet somehow the entire state falls flat and goes blue.
[01:34:58.529 --> 01:34:59.550]  I'm not buying it, Joe.
[01:35:01.087 --> 01:35:05.129]  Yeah, I mean, it's a travesty what's happening there.
[01:35:05.129 --> 01:35:11.032]  And Jim had that great post that you just mentioned a few moments ago about Arizona.
[01:35:11.032 --> 01:35:18.677]  So on election day, which is what they told all the Carrie Lake and all the conservatives, don't mail in your ballot, they'll switch it.
[01:35:23.539 --> 01:35:25.520]  So come in on election day and vote.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.480]  That's how we're going to beat them.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.742]  And apparently that strategy worked for Terry Lake in the primaries.
[01:35:29.742 --> 01:35:31.222]  And so people do.
[01:35:31.222 --> 01:35:34.103]  And then all of a sudden, the election day is a mess.
[01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:38.845]  And then all of a sudden, here we are on, you know, almost a week later now, they're still counting.
[01:35:38.845 --> 01:35:49.490]  And then like Jim reported this, this morning overnight, you know, they, according to a Democrat, there was 17% turnout for Democrats on election day.
[01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.231]  And yet we're seeing the results being
[01:35:53.399 --> 01:36:04.312]  You know, 54% for Katie Hobbs, this corrupt, not likable woman who certified the stolen election of 2020.
[01:36:04.312 --> 01:36:09.959]  And you're still the Secretary of State overseeing this gubernatorial race?
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:14.661]  Yeah, she should have been, she should have recused herself a long, long time ago.
[01:36:14.661 --> 01:36:21.643]  But of course, she's a Soros girl and they have to make sure everything gets corrupted rightly so they can steal all these races.
[01:36:21.643 --> 01:36:23.884]  And Arizona's really important.
[01:36:23.884 --> 01:36:30.546]  I think that's the, you know, the deep state, once they steal a state, they want to, they want to, you know, they want to lock it in.
[01:36:30.546 --> 01:36:32.766]  And Carrie Lake's a threat too.
[01:36:32.766 --> 01:36:37.988]  I think the thing about Carrie Lake is a lot of people think she's Vice President, if not President material.
[01:36:38.749 --> 01:36:49.508]  She's very polished, very smart, very mega, a big Trump supporter, and just a logical, perhaps, person if he runs again as a vice president.
[01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:55.872]  I'd like to knock her out, and it doesn't make any sense.
[01:36:55.872 --> 01:36:58.933]  So you know this, I want to share this before with you.
[01:36:58.933 --> 01:36:59.934]  I was a corporate auditor.
[01:36:59.934 --> 01:37:02.915]  I've done audits around the world, maybe two, three hundred audits.
[01:37:02.915 --> 01:37:08.798]  I was stationed in Hong Kong for a decade, overseeing an audit team over there.
[01:37:08.798 --> 01:37:11.700]  I've done fraud audits, financial, operational.
[01:37:11.700 --> 01:37:15.481]  I've earned 10 degrees designations, and it's really easy to see.
[01:37:15.481 --> 01:37:22.405]  First step in auditing is kind of look at your population, get a good definition of what it is and what the process is you're looking at.
[01:37:22.585 --> 01:37:24.506]  We don't even know her name!
[01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:45.532]  Yeah, I mean, she's repulsive, too.
[01:37:45.532 --> 01:37:48.134]  The lady's got a real squeaky little girl voice.
[01:37:48.134 --> 01:37:50.376]  It's just, she's weird.
[01:37:50.376 --> 01:37:51.997]  There's nothing attractive about her.
[01:37:51.997 --> 01:37:53.479]  So, kind of like Fetterman.
[01:37:53.479 --> 01:37:56.681]  I guess Fetterman's the other obvious, you know, anomaly.
[01:37:56.681 --> 01:38:00.605]  It's like, who's going to vote for that guy, especially after that debate?
[01:38:00.605 --> 01:38:02.046]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:38:02.046 --> 01:38:05.429]  Here's the problem with the Pennsylvania-Arizona dichotomy is that
[01:38:06.252 --> 01:38:08.354]  I mean, yeah, I believe Pennsylvania was stolen.
[01:38:08.354 --> 01:38:11.756]  There's no way Fetterman could actually win, but what's the point of contesting that?
[01:38:11.756 --> 01:38:13.257]  The Republicans aren't battling for that.
[01:38:13.257 --> 01:38:14.918]  The Democrats own Pennsylvania.
[01:38:14.918 --> 01:38:15.819]  They've stamped it.
[01:38:15.819 --> 01:38:19.582]  There's no chance a Republican wins in a state-ride election in Pennsylvania.
[01:38:19.582 --> 01:38:20.642]  The Democrats just own it.
[01:38:20.642 --> 01:38:23.264]  So it's like, okay, I'm not going to focus on a futile fight here.
[01:38:23.264 --> 01:38:24.945]  But I have hope for Arizona.
[01:38:24.945 --> 01:38:29.529]  No matter the results, I think Lake and Masters and Fincham and Hominy, they're going to fight it.
[01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:30.449]  They're going to sue.
[01:38:30.449 --> 01:38:31.490]  They're going to call for audits.
[01:38:31.490 --> 01:38:32.931]  They're going to call for recounts.
[01:38:32.931 --> 01:38:34.032]  I think they're going to fight this deal.
[01:38:35.274 --> 01:38:41.276]  I think they should, you know, and I think they ultimately should ask for a new election because this was fraudulent.
[01:38:41.276 --> 01:38:51.520]  Now, what I've heard about what happened on election day, I got a piece yesterday from some individuals and there's an IT guy out there that looked at this and what appears that
[01:38:52.276 --> 01:38:56.558]  They changed the size of the ballot.
[01:38:56.558 --> 01:38:58.719]  Previously it was 19 inches long.
[01:38:58.719 --> 01:39:00.339]  Now it's 20 inches.
[01:39:00.339 --> 01:39:02.900]  And so that worked fine for all these mail-in ballots.
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.141]  They had the machinery that would handle them.
[01:39:05.141 --> 01:39:11.824]  But on election day, these machines that they're using on site apparently would only handle 19-inch paper.
[01:39:11.824 --> 01:39:14.705]  So then they had to shrink the images down to 19 inches.
[01:39:14.705 --> 01:39:16.926]  And then they tried to run them through the tabulators.
[01:39:16.926 --> 01:39:18.227]  The tabulators couldn't find the
[01:39:22.313 --> 01:39:29.877]  And so it appears to be something intentional, just a mechanism to mess with and steal the election.
[01:39:29.877 --> 01:39:35.180]  Because then they tell people, throw your ballots over here, we'll be sure to get to them later.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:42.224]  You don't know if they are, you don't know where these ballots are going, and then you end up with 54% for high.
[01:39:42.224 --> 01:39:47.707]  And maybe you haven't heard this, because I heard that news about the new ballot length.
[01:39:47.707 --> 01:39:50.929]  It was kind of breaking this weekend, and this maybe gives you a better idea.
[01:39:51.810 --> 01:40:10.517]  I know that in Travis County, where I voted in Texas, they had the same thing where they expanded the length of the insert that you put in, but they knew that in advance, and so they knew they had to print out more paper than they normally do, so they had that ready to go, and even though the machines would run out of ink quicker because of the bigger paper, they had it all ready to go.
[01:40:10.517 --> 01:40:16.739]  I witnessed it in real time, it happening, and they were able to get everything lined up so that all the images were read properly.
[01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:21.361]  So, it wasn't only Arizona that changed the size of this, it was only Arizona that had problems.
[01:40:22.358 --> 01:40:23.259]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:40:23.259 --> 01:40:26.461]  So they didn't adequately address it.
[01:40:26.461 --> 01:40:29.623]  And I saw somebody else sent something out on Twitter overnight, too.
[01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:38.909]  I haven't written about this, but they were pointing out in the manual all these things that are missing conveniently, and then they didn't prepare properly.
[01:40:38.909 --> 01:40:45.793]  So who would have guessed it, especially knowing that the Republicans are the group that's going to show up on Election Day?
[01:40:45.793 --> 01:40:47.674]  Because we can't trust these people.
[01:40:47.674 --> 01:40:51.937]  And I guess that strategy worked for Kerry Lake in the primary, so it was a good strategy.
[01:40:52.057 --> 01:40:52.939]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:07.671]  Yes, we are.
[01:41:23.827 --> 01:41:26.731]  I guess for myself, I stepped in with this election.
[01:41:26.731 --> 01:41:30.155]  I'm not too demoralized because I kind of knew they'd do it.
[01:41:30.155 --> 01:41:35.541]  There was not enough that changed and there was belief and a lot of people worked really hard.
[01:41:35.541 --> 01:41:38.344]  I don't want to discount that, but we didn't change the
[01:41:38.444 --> 01:41:42.088]  Core issues and that's kind of like auditing one-on-one too.
[01:41:42.088 --> 01:41:59.806]  You do and I've seen this where auditors will go in and do a do an audit and they'll come up with a recommendation on how to change things for the better and it doesn't address the root cause and the root cause in our elections is those machines and the and of course these absentee ballots.
[01:42:00.246 --> 01:42:00.446]  Yes.
[01:42:24.833 --> 01:42:26.074]  We're good to go.
[01:42:56.369 --> 01:42:58.471]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[01:42:58.471 --> 01:43:01.253]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[01:43:01.253 --> 01:43:03.254]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[01:43:03.254 --> 01:43:05.316]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[01:43:05.316 --> 01:43:07.057]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[01:43:07.057 --> 01:43:09.439]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[01:43:09.439 --> 01:43:10.880]  You forget to take the X3.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:12.381]  And you know it makes your life better.
[01:43:12.381 --> 01:43:13.842]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[01:43:13.842 --> 01:43:15.003]  And you constantly forget.
[01:43:15.003 --> 01:43:16.965]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[01:43:17.617 --> 01:43:20.800]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[01:43:53.907 --> 01:43:59.992]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:43:59.992 --> 01:44:03.054]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[01:44:04.073 --> 01:44:09.095]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:44:09.095 --> 01:44:13.476]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[01:44:13.476 --> 01:44:18.418]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:44:19.153 --> 01:44:23.758]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:44:23.758 --> 01:44:30.444]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.

[01:45:55.186 --> 01:46:01.951]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[01:46:01.951 --> 01:46:15.059]  And the globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:40.653]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[01:46:40.653 --> 01:46:44.995]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[01:46:57.241 --> 01:46:59.882]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.975 --> 01:47:20.801]  We've got Joe Hoff with us here, another segment.
[01:47:20.801 --> 01:47:22.382]  I want to continue with the election coverage.
[01:47:22.382 --> 01:47:29.508]  If we get an extra minute here, maybe get his opinion on the FTX Democrat money laundering situation as an expert auditor himself.
[01:47:32.205 --> 01:47:33.486]  There's two things here.
[01:47:33.486 --> 01:47:36.548]  I'll throw one out there just because we've mentioned it in the last segment.
[01:47:36.548 --> 01:47:44.275]  Clearly the incompetence of Katie Hobbs as the Secretary of State is showing here with this disaster during the election.
[01:47:44.275 --> 01:47:45.956]  That clearly shows her incompetence.
[01:47:45.956 --> 01:47:51.140]  She shouldn't be the governor if that's the level of leadership she has.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:57.245]  But you mentioned something earlier that resonated with me because I feel the same way and that's
[01:47:58.310 --> 01:48:08.479]  I'm not feeling near the amount of frustration that the mean of the Republicans and their voters seem to be facing because we knew this was coming.
[01:48:08.479 --> 01:48:12.222]  And it seems like the frustration is really going downstream now, Joe.
[01:48:12.222 --> 01:48:18.147]  It seems that the frustrations that we've had for decades, for decades, dealing with the corruption in this country,
[01:48:18.977 --> 01:48:19.117]  Is it?
[01:48:33.945 --> 01:48:47.374]  Viewed as a conspiracy theorist because they're asking basic questions about why their elections don't work or how it's possible that a candidate that doesn't even campaign or do rallies or a debate can beat a candidate with huge momentum and energy behind her, Hobbs versus Lake.
[01:48:47.374 --> 01:49:00.263]  So it seems to me that the frustration is moving downstream, which what happens with that is the frustration hits first and then the reality hits second and then the activism is what the conclusion finally is.
[01:49:00.263 --> 01:49:02.544]  That's kind of the process I'm seeing here.
[01:49:02.544 --> 01:49:03.065]  What about you?
[01:49:04.352 --> 01:49:05.973]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:49:05.973 --> 01:49:30.893]  And yeah, and then to clarify, too, we've had some of these leaders in the Republican Party and over the last couple of days, and some have said terrible candidates, which I thought was horrible, especially if I was one of these guys who ran, you know, and gave up, you know, a year of my life trying to win one of these races, then to be told by some, you know, slimeball that I wasn't good enough and that's why I lost.
[01:49:30.893 --> 01:49:31.453]  I'd be really
[01:49:31.533 --> 01:49:31.953]  I don't think
[01:49:55.450 --> 01:50:03.636]  We can't do that because, and I don't think she fully understands it, because this isn't because that they've figured out how to get their people to mail in their ballots.
[01:50:03.636 --> 01:50:08.300]  It's that they've figured out that they can do more fraud when they do mail-in ballots.
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.742]  And I don't think Molly Hemingway understands that.
[01:50:10.742 --> 01:50:18.828]  And yet this is the same people that, you know, did the Mueller exam on Trump for four years and attempted coup d'etat on President Trump.
[01:50:18.828 --> 01:50:22.951]  It's the same people that have been involved in so many corrupt activities over the last
[01:50:23.311 --> 01:50:28.592]  A few years, decades, you know, the list goes on and on and on.
[01:50:28.592 --> 01:50:33.713]  And the 2020 election, and now here we are, 22, the same thing.
[01:50:33.713 --> 01:50:35.073]  That's not the answer.
[01:50:35.073 --> 01:50:40.274]  The answer is we've got to first get rid of these bogus names off of these voter rolls.
[01:50:40.274 --> 01:50:48.396]  And there's a group in Wisconsin that wrote to me, and I put it up this morning at the Gateway Pundit, and they're bragging about their work, but Wisconsin didn't go so well.
[01:50:48.396 --> 01:50:48.896]  And I asked them,
[01:50:49.236 --> 01:50:58.289]  They said, well, because they wouldn't accept our changes in their voter rolls, but in the states that did, we clearly cleaned house, which Texas was one of them, I guess.
[01:50:58.289 --> 01:50:59.351]  Yeah, Texas and Florida.
[01:51:00.433 --> 01:51:11.524]  Yeah, and so they were able to get those voter rolls up to date so they can't steal, because I swear to God, you know, you said, you were saying before the break about somebody's cat, somebody's dog, they're on the list.
[01:51:11.524 --> 01:51:13.646]  I mean, I think they just make names up.
[01:51:13.646 --> 01:51:16.749]  I don't even, you know, they just say unknown names and stuff.
[01:51:16.749 --> 01:51:20.693]  It's the ghost of, you know, it's the ghost of Cornwallis.
[01:51:20.693 --> 01:51:23.576]  It's the ghost of George Washington, you know.
[01:51:23.576 --> 01:51:24.217]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:51:25.373 --> 01:51:29.638]  So they make that stuff up, but then it's the machines as well, like we talked about.
[01:51:29.638 --> 01:51:33.722]  And yeah, you know, this is appalling.
[01:51:33.722 --> 01:51:36.225]  This deserves our rage.
[01:51:36.225 --> 01:51:37.627]  This is really bad.
[01:51:37.627 --> 01:51:41.571]  And we're seeing how to maybe handle this from the people in Brazil.
[01:51:41.571 --> 01:51:44.174]  Well, yeah, they're out in the streets by the millions.
[01:51:45.123 --> 01:51:46.384]  By the millions.
[01:51:46.384 --> 01:51:52.290]  And they even followed some of these, you know, I'll call them whatever, slime dogs, whatever, to New York City.
[01:51:52.290 --> 01:51:56.034]  They're there the next couple days and they're protesting them in New York City.
[01:51:56.034 --> 01:51:56.435]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.435 --> 01:51:57.716]  And there are a bunch in New York City.
[01:51:57.716 --> 01:51:59.137]  Thousands of them in New York City.
[01:51:59.137 --> 01:51:59.618]  Brazilians.
[01:52:00.968 --> 01:52:02.269]  And that's what you do.
[01:52:02.269 --> 01:52:03.589]  Look at that picture.
[01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:04.490]  It's just amazing.
[01:52:04.490 --> 01:52:05.970]  There's a video that goes with that.
[01:52:05.970 --> 01:52:07.111]  It's just amazing.
[01:52:07.111 --> 01:52:07.851]  Massive crowd.
[01:52:07.851 --> 01:52:09.032]  This is over the weekend.
[01:52:09.032 --> 01:52:12.433]  People in Brazil, you know, know that their election was stolen.
[01:52:12.433 --> 01:52:13.994]  They know how important it is.
[01:52:13.994 --> 01:52:15.595]  And people here have been silenced.
[01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:16.495]  And our media has done this.
[01:52:20.786 --> 01:52:25.907]  Outlets like yours and the Gateway Pundit and others that are trying to get the truth out and you know what?
[01:52:25.907 --> 01:52:39.430]  We're doing a great job because people know that this election in 2020 was stolen and they know this and they're sitting back saying that here we go again saying same thing and So it's you know, it's good what we're doing.
[01:52:39.430 --> 01:52:45.231]  It's just that we've got You know, we've got a major no issue here that we've got it.
[01:52:45.231 --> 01:52:47.632]  We've got to address well, and you know
[01:52:48.317 --> 01:52:56.464]  You bring this up because I do think this is the debate, and I think Hemingway is kind of throwing the red meat out there, but I do think this is the debate here.
[01:52:56.464 --> 01:53:05.372]  If the goal is to get us back to in-person day of voting paper ballots, well then you have to measure out the best path to get there.
[01:53:06.221 --> 01:53:11.845]  And so I kind of throw this out there to have the debate, I'll get your take on it, even though I kind of already know where you stand.
[01:53:11.845 --> 01:53:19.531]  I mean, I think the quickest way to get there would be, the Republicans need to do what the Democrats are doing, and they need to have big Trump rallies, okay?
[01:53:19.531 --> 01:53:27.677]  Have a Trump rally, 20-30,000 people, have a voter registration booth right there at the rally, and have it right across the place from an early voting center.
[01:53:27.677 --> 01:53:32.581]  And just send 20,000 people to vote, early vote, at every Republican rally.
[01:53:32.581 --> 01:53:35.323]  Oh, the Democrats will be against it then, won't they?
[01:53:36.458 --> 01:53:39.680]  Yeah, well, I think, quite frankly, I think that's a great idea.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.661]  That's what they're doing.
[01:53:40.661 --> 01:53:43.082]  And fill out the ballots, mail them in.
[01:53:43.082 --> 01:53:44.363]  And here's what we found out, too.
[01:53:44.363 --> 01:53:50.507]  These new devices that they have for when you walk into a polling place and it looks like an iPad.
[01:53:50.507 --> 01:53:52.428]  I think it basically is.
[01:53:52.428 --> 01:53:57.411]  Probably paid a hundred times what it's worth because they're calling it something else.
[01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:00.253]  And those things are connected to the net.
[01:54:00.253 --> 01:54:02.894]  They know real time who's voted.
[01:54:02.894 --> 01:54:09.839]  And I think that helps them then when they try to steal the ballots, they know which voters haven't voted.
[01:54:09.839 --> 01:54:12.680]  They can figure that out with a simple query.
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:20.005]  And then they drop 100,000 votes for a candidate or 10,000 or whatever's needed.
[01:54:20.005 --> 01:54:24.288]  And they know who to register on that voter
[01:54:25.054 --> 01:54:25.975]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:54:25.975 --> 01:54:31.860]  But the thing that grabs me about Hemingway is that I don't think she recognizes that this election was stolen.
[01:54:40.267 --> 01:54:40.347]  Yes.
[01:54:58.764 --> 01:55:00.625]  I'm telling this.
[01:55:00.625 --> 01:55:05.727]  He couldn't get 2,000 people at his rallies leading up to the election from Labor Day to Election Day.
[01:55:05.727 --> 01:55:06.668]  No, it's a total joke.
[01:55:06.668 --> 01:55:10.970]  It's just like in Brazil, and now it's just being proven again with the millions of people in the street.
[01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:18.613]  The one difference between Brazil and there's still an election in ours is that the military is actually on Bolsonaro's side, whereas here, not so much with Trump.
[01:55:18.613 --> 01:55:22.035]  But let me just get your two-minute analysis, because you talk about the theft and the money.
[01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:23.837]  And that is involved with this too.
[01:55:23.837 --> 01:55:31.247]  We just found out with FTX, the money laundering that the Democrats did through Ukraine and FTX to just take your money, put it right back in their own pockets.
[01:55:31.247 --> 01:55:32.709]  Just clear money laundering.
[01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:35.653]  I mean, literally the standard for money laundering.
[01:55:35.653 --> 01:55:37.255]  Your two minutes on that situation.
[01:55:38.334 --> 01:55:41.215]  Well thanks, and you guys have done a great job keeping up on that too.
[01:55:41.215 --> 01:55:45.676]  I noticed some articles of yours over the weekend.
[01:55:45.676 --> 01:56:05.182]  So the way I look at it, this guy created this FTX and took people's money, promised that he was investing it in whatever cryptocurrencies they requested, then basically used the money for something else, and then he creates a big investment arm, and then he's working with all the Dems, and you've got him at the
[01:56:06.042 --> 01:56:20.475]  With the Clinton Foundation at a recent event sitting right next to Bill Clinton, and then you've got him donating $40 million to this election, maybe more than anybody, other than maybe, I think, George Soros at this election.
[01:56:20.475 --> 01:56:23.858]  You've got him donating to the Bidens.
[01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:28.582]  You know, and I think that's really the smaller part of the story.
[01:56:28.582 --> 01:56:46.933]  I think the bigger part is that we were sending billions of dollars over to the Ukraine, and then somehow Ukraine gets involved with FTX, and then we end up working, they invest, they say, in FTX, and how many billions of this whatever 60 now billion that went to the Ukraine,
[01:56:47.533 --> 01:56:50.394]  Actually landed in Ukraine and helped the people there.
[01:56:50.394 --> 01:56:51.755]  I doubt much.
[01:56:51.755 --> 01:57:04.100]  I think the big story here is that of these billions that went overseas, a lot came back through cryptocurrency, which is then hard to follow and track.
[01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:10.363]  And there's a lot of people with some big, big bank accounts and or cryptocurrency wallets.
[01:57:10.843 --> 01:57:14.885]  Full of this Ukrainian dollars that we sent over there for the Ukraine.
[01:57:14.885 --> 01:57:19.227]  And then, you know, the people in Ukraine, no wonder they're getting crushed by Russia.
[01:57:19.227 --> 01:57:20.728]  And which Armenia won't report.
[01:57:20.728 --> 01:57:22.469]  Yeah, Armenia is lying about that too.
[01:57:22.469 --> 01:57:23.969]  We got more developments there.
[01:57:23.969 --> 01:57:24.710]  We'll cover later.
[01:57:24.710 --> 01:57:26.050]  Joe Hoff, The Gateway Pundit.
[01:57:26.050 --> 01:57:26.871]  Great stuff as always.
[01:57:26.871 --> 01:57:28.732]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:57:28.732 --> 01:57:28.932]  Thanks.
[01:57:29.796 --> 01:57:35.225]  And folks, you know, people will say, oh, you can't say the Democrats are money laundering in Ukraine.
[01:57:35.225 --> 01:57:36.687]  That was back in April.
[01:57:36.687 --> 01:57:37.208]  Oh, really?
[01:57:37.208 --> 01:57:38.230]  I can't?
[01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:39.031]  Oh, how'd I know?
[01:57:39.031 --> 01:57:41.515]  How did we know they were money laundering?
[01:57:41.515 --> 01:57:42.296]  How did we know?
[01:57:42.296 --> 01:57:42.877]  I don't know.
[01:57:42.877 --> 01:57:43.558]  Oh, it's a mystery.
[01:57:47.563 --> 01:57:51.906]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[01:57:51.906 --> 01:58:03.092]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[01:58:04.033 --> 01:58:15.818]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[01:58:15.818 --> 01:58:19.020]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are

[01:58:48.668 --> 01:58:52.151]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[01:58:52.151 --> 01:58:53.472]  Why can't we do this here?
[01:58:53.472 --> 01:58:55.974]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[01:58:55.974 --> 01:59:01.820]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.802]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[01:59:03.802 --> 01:59:05.704]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[01:59:05.704 --> 01:59:07.627]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[01:59:07.627 --> 01:59:17.398]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single state.
[01:59:17.398 --> 01:59:19.600]  We need more of this communication, not less.
[01:59:48.124 --> 02:00:00.406]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.406 --> 02:00:15.169]  We're about to be joined by Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto, to get into the FTX situation.
[02:00:16.178 --> 02:00:21.760]  Let me hit some of these headlines ahead of that, though.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:27.062]  First of all, guys, let's just be very clear.
[02:00:27.062 --> 02:00:44.348]  The images that you see on the screen here, the FBI images of pedophilia symbols that appear to be in the Almeida Research symbol and appear to be in the FSBF Twitter profile, folks, that's just a coincidence, okay?
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:46.381]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:00:46.381 --> 02:00:47.442]  Don't pay attention to this.
[02:00:47.442 --> 02:00:49.644]  Don't even look at this at all.
[02:00:49.644 --> 02:00:55.048]  It's just merely a coincidence that these symbols happen to be all over the Democrat Party politics.
[02:00:55.048 --> 02:00:56.089]  Please, folks.
[02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:56.409]  Please.
[02:00:56.409 --> 02:00:57.330]  Just ignore this.
[02:00:57.330 --> 02:00:58.691]  Don't look at this.
[02:00:58.691 --> 02:00:59.632]  Just a coincidence.
[02:00:59.632 --> 02:01:00.653]  Nothing to see here.
[02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:04.135]  Now, here are some of the headlines.
[02:01:04.135 --> 02:01:09.179]  Bahamas Police and Bahamas Securities Commission looking into FTX activities for wrongdoing.
[02:01:09.179 --> 02:01:12.622]  Will they find 10% to the big guy, Joe Biden? 10%?
[02:01:15.092 --> 02:01:15.592]  10%?
[02:01:15.592 --> 02:01:17.613]  10%?
[02:01:17.613 --> 02:01:19.593]  I think the Democrats are getting closer to 100%?
[02:01:19.593 --> 02:01:20.174]  10%!
[02:01:20.174 --> 02:01:30.396]  Yeah, Joe Biden, he doesn't even know what planet he's on though.
[02:01:30.396 --> 02:01:34.737]  How much of the billions to Ukraine was laundered back to US politicians via FTX?
[02:01:34.737 --> 02:01:37.078]  Will we ever get a fair investigation?
[02:01:37.078 --> 02:01:39.178]  I don't know, they're busy looking into Elon Musk.
[02:01:39.178 --> 02:01:40.999]  He's a Republican voter now, so...
[02:01:42.324 --> 02:01:43.825]  You know how that goes.
[02:01:43.825 --> 02:01:45.166]  It is amazing, though, isn't it?
[02:01:45.166 --> 02:01:46.607]  I mean, truly, folks, truly.
[02:01:46.607 --> 02:01:54.973]  Like, people in the corporate world, people in the political world know, you come out as a liberal Democrat, you're above the law.
[02:01:54.973 --> 02:01:56.234]  They know it.
[02:01:56.234 --> 02:01:56.634]  They know it!
[02:01:57.845 --> 02:02:03.188]  You come out as a Liberal Democrat, you donate to Liberal Democrat causes, you are now above the law.
[02:02:03.188 --> 02:02:18.596]  So they'll investigate Elon Musk for the next two years, dealing with the Twitter thing, they'll investigate Tesla and SpaceX and all those other endeavors, and they will do nothing to the people that just stole billions of dollars and gave it to the Democrat Party and laundered money through Ukraine.
[02:02:18.596 --> 02:02:18.736]  Yeah.
[02:02:20.467 --> 02:02:28.456]  FTX facing criminal probe by the Hamas authorities, but Musk counters will be no investigation of major Democrat donor.
[02:02:28.456 --> 02:02:30.258]  And he's right!
[02:02:30.258 --> 02:02:30.759]  He'll be right.
[02:02:30.759 --> 02:02:31.379]  They'll let him off.
[02:02:31.379 --> 02:02:33.121]  They're all searching for themselves.
[02:02:33.121 --> 02:02:35.104]  They all knew it was going on the whole time.
[02:02:35.104 --> 02:02:35.885]  Manhattan U.S.
[02:02:35.885 --> 02:02:38.207]  Attorney Office probing FTX collapse.
[02:02:38.207 --> 02:02:39.028]  That's Democrats.
[02:02:39.028 --> 02:02:39.729]  They'll find nothing.
[02:02:41.457 --> 02:02:41.777]  U.S.
[02:02:41.777 --> 02:02:45.580]  Senator threatens Elon Musk, Edward Markey, over the weekend.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:48.201]  And it's the Biden administration, it's Jake Sullivan now.
[02:02:48.201 --> 02:02:52.704]  They're all saying they're going to go after Elon Musk because he supports free speech.
[02:02:52.704 --> 02:02:58.268]  Elon Musk should have been working to launder money for the Democrat Party.
[02:02:58.268 --> 02:02:59.549]  Don't you see how it works?
[02:02:59.549 --> 02:03:00.669]  But Elon Musk knows that.
[02:03:00.669 --> 02:03:01.890]  He knew the risks.
[02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:05.812]  He knew they were going to come after them and he's taking it all in stride.
[02:03:05.812 --> 02:03:06.393]  But here it is.
[02:03:07.395 --> 02:03:12.358]  Landmark trial involving Tesla autopilot weighs if man or machine at fault.
[02:03:12.358 --> 02:03:18.021]  Elon Musk trial opens to decide fate of his $56 billion Tesla pay.
[02:03:18.021 --> 02:03:21.423]  And then there's an issue they're investigating with SpaceX and everything.
[02:03:21.423 --> 02:03:25.986]  So, here's the thing that Elon Musk has over his head.
[02:03:25.986 --> 02:03:32.349]  He's got these legal battles that are like anvils sitting over his head right now with Tesla, SpaceX and other things.
[02:03:32.349 --> 02:03:34.771]  And the deep state and the Democrats are basically saying,
[02:03:35.666 --> 02:03:42.592]  If you do what you're intending to do with Twitter, we're going to cut that rope and that anvil is going to smash you on the head.
[02:03:42.592 --> 02:03:51.179]  And if you continue to go anti-liberal, anti-woke, we're going to cut the other rope and that anvil is going to smash you on the head.
[02:03:51.179 --> 02:03:56.284]  And if you ever think that you're going to return free speech to Twitter, just know this.
[02:03:56.969 --> 02:04:09.014]  The moment you let Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and others back on Twitter is the moment that we will remove you from the Apple App Store, and the moment we will remove you from the Google Play App Store.
[02:04:09.014 --> 02:04:12.376]  That's their plan.
[02:04:12.376 --> 02:04:13.577]  That's what they've already done.
[02:04:13.577 --> 02:04:15.317]  It's what they've done in the past.
[02:04:15.317 --> 02:04:16.618]  It's what they've done to InfoWars.
[02:04:16.618 --> 02:04:17.818]  It's what they've done to others.
[02:04:17.818 --> 02:04:20.360]  It's what they will do to Elon Musk.
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:25.602]  Now the good news is, Elon Musk seems to be ready for this fight.
[02:04:26.554 --> 02:04:32.518]  And Elon Musk may or may not be the richest man in the world.
[02:04:32.518 --> 02:04:49.669]  But we'll see how that fares in the coming weeks, months and years as the Deep State looks to destroy Elon Musk and he looks to return free speech to Twitter and continue to innovate the world of space travel and engineering on planet Earth.
[02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:54.432]  But coming up next to get into the FTX scandal, Ben Armstrong, BitBoy Crypto.
[02:04:54.432 --> 02:04:54.993]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:04:59.133 --> 02:05:01.275]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[02:05:01.275 --> 02:05:03.838]  And I'm also looking right back at myself.
[02:05:03.838 --> 02:05:05.840]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.902]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[02:05:07.902 --> 02:05:09.644]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[02:05:09.644 --> 02:05:12.027]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:12.027 --> 02:05:13.448]  You forget to take DX3.
[02:05:13.448 --> 02:05:14.970]  And you know it makes your life better.
[02:05:14.970 --> 02:05:16.411]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[02:05:16.411 --> 02:05:17.593]  And you constantly forget.
[02:05:17.593 --> 02:05:19.555]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[02:05:20.197 --> 02:05:23.380]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[02:06:04.551 --> 02:06:07.914]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:06:07.914 --> 02:06:13.700]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:22.327]  And we're joined now by Ben Armstrong, BitBoyCrypto.com, BitBoy underscore crypto on Twitter.
[02:06:22.327 --> 02:06:26.631]  And, I mean, we knew the Democrats were laundering money through Ukraine.
[02:06:26.631 --> 02:06:29.234]  That was pretty obvious to anybody paying attention.
[02:06:30.006 --> 02:06:37.152]  But never saw the crypto exchange FTX being the money laundering front organization to do this.
[02:06:37.152 --> 02:06:48.841]  But you know, Ben, now that I'm kind of looking at and investigating it, and you know, I've never really been a big crypto commentator myself, but when I'm looking at it now, it was so obvious from the beginning, wasn't it?
[02:06:48.841 --> 02:06:57.047]  I mean, now that we're looking back on this, was the whole entire FTX scandal not sitting out there from the very beginning that this was going to be the case?
[02:06:57.047 --> 02:06:58.028]  Ben Armstrong, your take.
[02:06:59.136 --> 02:07:00.117]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:07:00.117 --> 02:07:03.840]  I mean, it was sitting right in front of our eyes, right on our noses the entire time.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.783]  And that's why a lot of us have a lot of egg on our face in the crypto world.
[02:07:06.783 --> 02:07:13.950]  Just just for buying into what Sam Bankman Freed presented himself as, you know, he always tried to present himself as like
[02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:15.551]  Can you figure, is he good?
[02:07:15.551 --> 02:07:16.111]  Is he bad?
[02:07:16.111 --> 02:07:20.233]  It was hard for us to ever really know until now.
[02:07:20.233 --> 02:07:32.579]  And you look back, if you look back at several of the projects that launched on FTX, ICP, Hasper, Aptos, New Genesis Protocol that was on Liquid.
[02:07:32.579 --> 02:07:35.380]  You look at all these projects and you realize that
[02:07:36.132 --> 02:07:39.014]  There were so many signs that this stuff was going on.
[02:07:39.014 --> 02:07:46.297]  There were so many projects that Sam Bingman Freed destroyed by shorting them to zero and creating a counterfeit supply on the exchange.
[02:07:46.297 --> 02:07:48.919]  It was a scam from the very, very, very beginning.
[02:07:48.919 --> 02:07:51.900]  And we're really just kind of getting down the rabbit hole.
[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:59.464]  I mean, you know, right now what we're focused on, we're focused on like cracking the egg here on what actually happened with the scam itself.
[02:07:59.764 --> 02:08:06.747]  And then of course you start moving into the Ukraine situation and the politics and the fact that, look, it doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat.
[02:08:06.747 --> 02:08:13.869]  What matters is, is that Sam Bateman Freed was literally using your customer funds to support both sides.
[02:08:13.869 --> 02:08:27.314]  Obviously, heavily tilted Democrat there, but he supported Republicans with Democrats' money, he supported Democrats with Republicans' money, and that right there is an absolute scam and a fraud within itself that should change some, you know, election donation and contribution laws.
[02:08:28.211 --> 02:08:37.594]  Well, and we'll see if it does, but just so the layman understands this, because not everybody is really up to date on how crypto works and all this stuff.
[02:08:37.594 --> 02:08:41.675]  So explain it to the layman here, myself included.
[02:08:41.675 --> 02:08:43.736]  Investors invest in crypto.
[02:08:43.736 --> 02:08:48.437]  They give their dollar, their US dollar, to FTX Exchange.
[02:08:49.412 --> 02:08:57.082]  They're supposed to have this big mass of capital that can at least back up some of their exchanges if people want to trade out or trade in or all of this stuff.
[02:08:57.082 --> 02:09:04.412]  And I guess organically, a bunch of people were demanding to pull out at the same time and they realized that there was no reserves?
[02:09:04.412 --> 02:09:05.153]  Or how did that go?
[02:09:06.357 --> 02:09:08.719]  No, that's not what happened at all, actually.
[02:09:08.719 --> 02:09:10.120]  We have been sounding the alarm bell on this.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.862]  You can go back to October 29th.
[02:09:11.862 --> 02:09:16.005]  There's a tweet that we put out where we begged people to close their accounts and take money off FTX.
[02:09:16.005 --> 02:09:22.390]  We certainly think that we did have a certain amount of people that did withdraw to the point that they felt the crunch.
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:35.801]  But what actually happened is, is that with a lot of these exchanges, they just get so greed hungry that they end up borrowing the customer funds to make low leverage trades that they think will never go bust.
[02:09:36.334 --> 02:09:43.566]  But the thing about leverage is, you know, you're always at some point going to meet a liquidation, you know, or crazy stop loss is going to set you off.
[02:09:43.566 --> 02:09:48.375]  So what you're looking at is when you're on FTX and you are looking at the overall pool of funds on there,
[02:09:49.048 --> 02:09:52.909]  You actually did not, there was actually not assets there.
[02:09:52.909 --> 02:09:57.750]  Supposedly, there was $900 million worth of real assets and they were $9 billion in the hole.
[02:09:57.750 --> 02:10:13.133]  To understand the FTX fiasco, you have to understand Alameda Research, which is their VC arm that actually really got FTX funded and rolling in the beginning, that set off Caroline Ellison and Sam Bateman Freed to their kind of, you know, to the stage here.
[02:10:13.753 --> 02:10:27.216]  Is that there was a backdoor built into FTX, so that when Alameda was hurting for funds or needed funds, they could reach into those customer assets and pull them directly over to what they were doing with their trades, make the money back, and then put it back.
[02:10:27.216 --> 02:10:31.997]  You know, your classic Ponzi scheme is what it turned into, and eventually they couldn't put the money back.
[02:10:31.997 --> 02:10:38.898]  So what happened is, we have been front-running the story for weeks, because just a fluke on how we ended up kind of getting wind of all this.
[02:10:39.478 --> 02:10:46.906]  Well, CZ, who is the founder of Binance, the largest exchange in the world, well, he got wind of the same stuff that we had gotten wind of.
[02:10:46.906 --> 02:10:54.434]  And when he found out, he immediately dumped, I think it was $500 million worth of FTT tokens.
[02:10:54.434 --> 02:10:55.636]  So FTX was the exchange.
[02:10:56.236 --> 02:11:02.099]  They had a coin called FTT that they created that really didn't serve a purpose on the website.
[02:11:02.099 --> 02:11:04.881]  People were like, you know, why is this really even a thing?
[02:11:04.881 --> 02:11:20.668]  Well, what they would do is they would wash trade FTT back and forth between FTX and Alameda Research, and every time they would do that, they would pump up the price a little bit, and that kept their overall assets at a much higher amount because they were wash trading it.
[02:11:20.668 --> 02:11:25.431]  If you actually pulled FTT out of their portfolio, their portfolio would look very weak,
[02:11:25.991 --> 02:11:29.473]  Because it was so heavily invested in this coin that they pumped up the price of it.
[02:11:29.473 --> 02:11:33.695]  Basically the same thing the fiat system does in America is they just print money out of nothing.
[02:11:33.695 --> 02:11:34.756]  And so that's what they were doing.
[02:11:34.756 --> 02:11:40.139]  Well, when TZ found out about this, he dumped his FTZ tokens and destroyed the price.
[02:11:40.139 --> 02:11:43.901]  It went from $22 to $3 in a 24-hour period.
[02:11:43.901 --> 02:11:47.543]  And then all of a sudden, basically, FTX didn't have the windfall.
[02:11:47.543 --> 02:11:51.645]  They didn't have those FTZ tokens' value to be able to prop themselves up.
[02:11:51.645 --> 02:11:53.486]  And everybody woke up to what was happening.
[02:11:53.486 --> 02:11:55.207]  People started withdrawing their funds at that point.
[02:11:55.888 --> 02:11:58.090]  And it was already too late.
[02:11:58.090 --> 02:12:01.954]  By the time that people started pulling their funds out, it was already frozen.
[02:12:01.954 --> 02:12:06.539]  We had millions of dollars and thousands of accounts closed in the weeks leading up to this.
[02:12:06.539 --> 02:12:10.724]  Like I said, we've been warning people about this for about six weeks or more.
[02:12:10.724 --> 02:12:15.409]  So it sounds like you probably saved a lot of people a lot of money on that deal.
[02:12:15.409 --> 02:12:18.332]  Now, given the information we have now,
[02:12:19.554 --> 02:12:27.437]  Do you think this whole thing was set up for failure from the beginning to eventually target crypto for regulation and government control?
[02:12:27.437 --> 02:12:36.820]  Or do you think, you know, there was a level of organic human activity here that forced us into the position we're in now, and now they're just using it to regulate crypto?
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:38.981]  Where do you fall on that debate?
[02:12:39.952 --> 02:12:44.913]  Yeah, I certainly think that Washington has been totally fooled here by Sam Bankman-Fried.
[02:12:44.913 --> 02:12:50.855]  I think Gary Gensler in charge of the SEC, he's been meeting with Sam Bankman-Fried to talk about regulatory loopholes they can close.
[02:12:50.855 --> 02:12:59.777]  And, you know, kind of how this whole thing started between me and Sam is I actually had a bill, or I do have a bill, we're still trying to get funding for, that creates a mechanism for smart crypto regulation.
[02:12:59.777 --> 02:13:01.498]  Hopefully it will be public by the end of the month.
[02:13:02.078 --> 02:13:04.701]  And we went to FTX for funding for our bill.
[02:13:04.701 --> 02:13:07.284]  It was like $3.6 million to get this bill rolling.
[02:13:07.284 --> 02:13:12.228]  And through us contacting them is actually how we discovered what they were doing with regulation.
[02:13:12.228 --> 02:13:14.170]  We're trying to create a federal BitLicense.
[02:13:14.170 --> 02:13:17.314]  BitLicense in New York, worst piece of crypto regulation in history.
[02:13:17.314 --> 02:13:23.620]  Sam wanted to control and corner the market on licensure for centralization in the United States, meaning
[02:13:24.289 --> 02:13:27.651]  Centralized Exchange CEO, he gets all the benefits.
[02:13:27.651 --> 02:13:30.532]  Peer-to-peer transactions and anything decentralized will go away.
[02:13:30.532 --> 02:13:34.634]  So that's really what, you know, like a hound dog put us on this case in the very beginning.
[02:13:34.634 --> 02:13:41.577]  And so, no, we've been told that basically people in Washington thought Sam Bankman Freed was the adult in the room when it came to crypto.
[02:13:41.577 --> 02:13:42.777]  How ironic, right?
[02:13:42.777 --> 02:13:44.118]  I don't think this would set up.
[02:13:44.781 --> 02:13:47.983]  To bring in crypto regulation.
[02:13:47.983 --> 02:13:50.004]  I think quite the contrary.
[02:13:50.004 --> 02:13:56.629]  I think him trying to set up crypto regulation and then finding out what a scammer he is, I think it ultimately kind of helps crypto in the end.
[02:13:56.629 --> 02:13:59.310]  I think we are going to get some smart crypto regulation.
[02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:09.717]  What we want in crypto is we want the ability for us to have our leaders, to have our leaders in the movement to be able to say their piece about what we feel like things need to look like in crypto.
[02:14:09.717 --> 02:14:11.278]  At least have a seat at the table.
[02:14:11.278 --> 02:14:13.099]  That's what my bill basically does.
[02:14:13.699 --> 02:14:20.762]  However, we are going to see on the negative side of this, we are going to see Gary Gensler and them try to manipulate and use this for their advantage.
[02:14:20.762 --> 02:14:27.464]  But I want to say this, Gary Gensler is the person who has caused more loss in the crypto world than anybody else.
[02:14:27.464 --> 02:14:32.106]  His entire job at the head of the SEC is to create clarity and crypto regulation that makes sense.
[02:14:32.586 --> 02:14:34.448]  He's done literally zero of that.
[02:14:34.448 --> 02:14:35.609]  Literally zero.
[02:14:35.609 --> 02:14:43.677]  And what that means is you have companies like FTX that have to operate offshore and escape regulatory compliance here in the United States.
[02:14:43.677 --> 02:14:49.622]  They're going to continue to stay offshore until you create a mechanism that makes sense for crypto regulation.
[02:14:49.622 --> 02:14:55.548]  So if you really want to go back to who's responsible for all of this, it's really Gary Gensler with his dereliction of duty as head of the SEC.
[02:14:56.747 --> 02:15:08.759]  Well, and let's talk more about that on the other side of this break, because what I'm seeing happening now is whether or not there was an intention at the outset to use this to go after crypto regulation.
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:33.351]  This story I think has become such a, it's gone from what would be a keyhole into political money laundering to now like a three-story sliding glass window that even mainstream Republicans who try to be neutral like Greg Abbott are saying, hey wait a second, Democrats money laundering millions, maybe billions of dollars and then funding their campaigns in the midterms?
[02:15:33.351 --> 02:15:35.792]  I mean this should be massive criminal investigations
[02:15:36.492 --> 02:15:39.955]  And whether Republicans involvement too, I mean the whole thing should be investigated.
[02:15:39.955 --> 02:15:44.878]  So, I want to get your response to that, how you think this investigation should go.
[02:15:44.878 --> 02:15:51.242]  And then, I mean, there are a lot of people listening in right now that have crypto that probably are wondering, hey, what is it looking like for us right now?
[02:15:51.242 --> 02:15:52.844]  We'll get into all of that with Ben Armstrong.
[02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:53.344]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:15:53.954 --> 02:16:02.378]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:16:02.378 --> 02:16:03.398]  Here's why.
[02:16:03.398 --> 02:16:07.320]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:16:07.320 --> 02:16:12.442]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:16:12.442 --> 02:16:18.985]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply
[02:16:19.005 --> 02:16:19.406]  We're good to go.
[02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:36.202]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:16:36.202 --> 02:16:40.023]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.

[02:16:53.388 --> 02:16:54.349]  Hey everybody!
[02:16:54.349 --> 02:16:59.852]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:16:59.852 --> 02:17:02.294]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:17:02.294 --> 02:17:03.134]  Here's the thing.
[02:17:03.134 --> 02:17:07.437]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:17:07.437 --> 02:17:08.798]  Survival soup beans.
[02:17:08.798 --> 02:17:16.983]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:17:16.983 --> 02:17:17.544]  The best part?
[02:17:18.064 --> 02:17:27.374]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:17:27.374 --> 02:17:28.395]  Gets even better!
[02:17:28.395 --> 02:17:39.166]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[02:17:39.166 --> 02:17:39.587]  Period.
[02:17:39.967 --> 02:17:41.988]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:41.988 --> 02:17:44.149]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:44.149 --> 02:17:48.230]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:50.111]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:50.111 --> 02:17:51.992]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:17:54.938 --> 02:17:57.421]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:17:57.421 --> 02:17:58.702]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:17:58.702 --> 02:18:02.165]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[02:18:02.165 --> 02:18:03.506]  Why can't we do this here?
[02:18:03.506 --> 02:18:05.988]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[02:18:05.988 --> 02:18:11.854]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[02:18:12.014 --> 02:18:13.835]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[02:18:13.835 --> 02:18:15.757]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[02:18:15.757 --> 02:18:17.659]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[02:18:17.659 --> 02:18:28.247]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[02:18:28.247 --> 02:18:31.970]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:35.272]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[02:18:35.272 --> 02:18:37.714]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.
[02:18:37.714 --> 02:18:41.396]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[02:18:41.396 --> 02:18:44.719]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[02:18:44.719 --> 02:18:46.960]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:52.224]  This alternative media that we worked so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[02:18:52.224 --> 02:18:54.766]  We need more of this communications, not less.
[02:18:57.756 --> 02:18:58.217]  That's right.
[02:19:12.756 --> 02:19:13.036]  I don't know.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:31.582]  Vitamin C, 1100% with the rose hips and zinc.
[02:19:31.582 --> 02:19:33.483]  This is the Linus Pauling formula.
[02:19:33.483 --> 02:19:34.223]  You want it.
[02:19:34.223 --> 02:19:35.644]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:35.644 --> 02:19:36.985]  And the list goes on and on.
[02:19:36.985 --> 02:19:41.807]  DNA Force Plus, Rain Force Ultra, Super Mel Vitality, Fizzy Magnesium.
[02:19:41.807 --> 02:19:42.347]  All of it.
[02:19:42.347 --> 02:19:48.771]  From 40 to 60% off when you use promo code 1776 at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:51.152]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[02:19:51.152 --> 02:19:54.174]  If you don't boost your immune system, plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[02:19:57.894 --> 02:20:07.159]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:07.159 --> 02:20:22.707]  You know, I will say this on the debate of whether or not this entire thing was planned for collapse as the excuse to bring in crypto.
[02:20:23.675 --> 02:20:34.258]  You know, from my experience, when they have something planned like this, as a planned collapse for control, they have all their I's dotted and T's crossed.
[02:20:34.258 --> 02:20:35.738]  And they did not have it on this deal, folks.
[02:20:35.738 --> 02:20:40.379]  I mean, there's real political blowback and there's going to be real political consequences.
[02:20:40.379 --> 02:20:41.680]  And I mean, it was just so obvious.
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:44.380]  I mean, you can look back and say, wow, this was so obvious.
[02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:46.961]  But I mean, they steal elections right in the broad of day.
[02:20:46.961 --> 02:20:49.101]  They make viruses in a lab and release it in the broad of day.
[02:20:49.101 --> 02:20:49.862]  That's obvious, too.
[02:20:49.862 --> 02:20:50.522]  They get away with it.
[02:20:50.522 --> 02:20:51.162]  So it's not so
[02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:53.020]  Okay, it was obvious.
[02:20:53.020 --> 02:20:55.441]  Well, okay, they do a lot of things that are obvious.
[02:20:55.441 --> 02:21:04.863]  But it's the direct connection to Ukraine and the midterm elections that was so close to the chest, you feel like they did not plan on this thing going down.
[02:21:04.863 --> 02:21:09.365]  So I would err on the side of, no, this is a real organic blowback.
[02:21:09.365 --> 02:21:10.765]  This is real organic pushback.
[02:21:10.765 --> 02:21:14.666]  This is going to have real organic political consequences here.
[02:21:14.666 --> 02:21:18.047]  And of course, the deep state, the government's going to try to use it to regulate as well.
[02:21:19.321 --> 02:21:24.602]  But when it comes to the investigation, we're with Ben Armstrong here, BitBoy Crypto.
[02:21:24.602 --> 02:21:27.783]  When it comes to the investigation, how do you see this going?
[02:21:27.783 --> 02:21:34.224]  I mean, the FTX, the Almeda people, they're already flying all around, they're jet-setting all around, they're trying to hide.
[02:21:34.224 --> 02:21:40.225]  You know that the government is going to try to protect its own, like, you know, Gary, Deep State Gary.
[02:21:40.225 --> 02:21:42.925]  So where do you see this investigation going?
[02:21:42.925 --> 02:21:45.686]  And I mean, when is it really going to kick off?
[02:21:45.686 --> 02:21:46.706]  What do you think it's going to look like?
[02:21:47.992 --> 02:21:52.734]  Yeah, well, first and foremost, you know, there's a lot of people have been seeing this sentiment a lot.
[02:21:52.734 --> 02:21:58.637]  Is that, well, Sam Bateman Freedie gave so much money to Joe Biden that he's going to get off scot-free here.
[02:21:58.637 --> 02:22:00.158]  Don't buy into that.
[02:22:00.158 --> 02:22:05.380]  Sam Bateman Freed screwed and he is basically going to end up being the fall guy for this entire thing.
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:08.100]  Was he totally responsible for it?
[02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:08.381]  No.
[02:22:08.381 --> 02:22:09.441]  Is he a bad person?
[02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:10.181]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:22:10.181 --> 02:22:11.241]  Did he know what was going on?
[02:22:11.241 --> 02:22:11.921]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:22:11.921 --> 02:22:16.022]  Did he show no mercy to people consistently throughout the history of FTX?
[02:22:16.022 --> 02:22:16.922]  Absolutely.
[02:22:16.922 --> 02:22:19.023]  But he wasn't the only one acting here.
[02:22:19.023 --> 02:22:22.403]  There is another player in this game that people must know.
[02:22:22.403 --> 02:22:23.784]  Well, there's two, really.
[02:22:23.784 --> 02:22:30.445]  Gary Wang, who is a lot of people consider to be kind of the ghost in the machine, if you will, the expert hacker at FTX.
[02:22:31.646 --> 02:22:35.990]  Basically, he's someone who, you know, there's a lot of speculation has CCP ties.
[02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:38.332]  Gary Wang is someone to definitely pay attention to.
[02:22:38.332 --> 02:22:43.997]  If you went to the FTX page and looked up his bio, he's the only person that has his back turned to the camera.
[02:22:43.997 --> 02:22:48.822]  You only see him over the shoulder looking at a computer screen, if that tells you anything.
[02:22:48.822 --> 02:22:52.445]  The second person is Dan Friedberg.
[02:22:52.445 --> 02:22:55.428]  This guy, it was the general counsel for FTX.
[02:22:56.027 --> 02:22:57.773]  This guy, there's Gary Wang right there.
[02:22:57.773 --> 02:22:58.334]  You can see it.
[02:22:58.334 --> 02:22:59.458]  How weird is that?
[02:22:59.458 --> 02:23:01.484]  All the other photos are front-facing.
[02:23:01.484 --> 02:23:02.467]  Wang again!
[02:23:02.467 --> 02:23:03.209]  I'm just kidding.
[02:23:05.124 --> 02:23:12.008]  So Dan Friedberg, he's a general counsel for FTX, the lawyer for SPF, and here's what's so interesting about this guy.
[02:23:12.008 --> 02:23:14.189]  He's done this model before.
[02:23:14.189 --> 02:23:25.395]  If you look at the similarities between this and the Ultimate Bet poker scandal from the early 2000s, they recruited Phil Helmuth and Mike Matysow, two gigantic poker players, to promote it.
[02:23:25.395 --> 02:23:31.438]  And what happened is Dan Friedberg was in charge of setting up the infrastructure and the architecture of the shell game that was Ultimate Bet.
[02:23:32.288 --> 02:23:35.569]  Ultimately kept a lot of the powerful people there from getting in trouble.
[02:23:35.569 --> 02:23:41.050]  What they did was they created a software called God Mode, where they could see the other players' cards.
[02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:45.350]  They would literally call up these professional poker players and say, hey, do you want to play heads-up one-on-one?
[02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:46.231]  It might matter to us.
[02:23:46.231 --> 02:23:47.731]  We'd say, yeah, sure, of course.
[02:23:47.731 --> 02:23:52.392]  And then he would go play against these people not knowing they could see his cards from the inside.
[02:23:52.392 --> 02:23:55.172]  It took a million dollars from him in these heads-up games.
[02:23:55.172 --> 02:23:56.933]  So this all comes out.
[02:23:56.933 --> 02:23:58.853]  Well, Dan Freitberg was in charge of the entire thing.
[02:23:59.580 --> 02:24:02.682]  He's in charge of the General Council of FTX!
[02:24:02.682 --> 02:24:08.687]  Number one, shell game architecture, creating all these companies where you can't touch the people at the top.
[02:24:08.687 --> 02:24:09.527]  That was number one.
[02:24:09.527 --> 02:24:13.671]  Number two, the idea of being able to look at other players' cards in god mode.
[02:24:13.671 --> 02:24:15.372]  That's what FTX was exactly!
[02:24:16.099 --> 02:24:21.482]  FTX, from the inside of Alameda, could see all of the customers' trades before they went through.
[02:24:21.482 --> 02:24:25.344]  They could see where their sell orders were, where their buy orders were, where their leverage was.
[02:24:25.344 --> 02:24:28.566]  They could see where their, you know, their liquidation points were.
[02:24:28.566 --> 02:24:31.528]  They could see it, and they traded against it.
[02:24:31.528 --> 02:24:34.749]  Number three, one of the things is delete all the evidence.
[02:24:34.749 --> 02:24:36.130]  That's what UltimateVet did.
[02:24:36.130 --> 02:24:41.313]  Well, if you look at the giant hack from FTX the other night, all the money went to all these places that didn't really make sense.
[02:24:41.753 --> 02:24:44.114]  Because the money trail is not what is important.
[02:24:44.114 --> 02:24:53.858]  FTX was built with a fail-safe inside where they could send money out and destroy evidence and destroy, you know, trails that would lead investigators to the ultimate top here.
[02:24:53.858 --> 02:25:02.481]  And then number four, the fourth, you know, thing they have in common is find a fall guy, make sure he's responsible for everything, and we will dip out.
[02:25:02.481 --> 02:25:09.024]  Dan Friedberg did not even lose his license in the state of New York from the largest poker scandal in history.
[02:25:09.604 --> 02:25:10.065]  I don't know.
[02:25:26.484 --> 02:25:36.406]  You know, whether it's SBF's mom that was, you know, for a political lobbyist group, Mind the Gap, I think it was called, Caroline Ellison, the CEO of Alameda.
[02:25:36.406 --> 02:25:48.348]  You know, she obviously, her dad is Greg Ellison, who is direct boss to one Gary Gensler at MIT, and you start digging into all those connections, you start to find a lot of these people are kind of like, they're ghosts.
[02:25:48.348 --> 02:25:53.229]  Look into Greg Ellison, you can't really find anything about this guy, who was the leader of the finance at MIT.
[02:25:54.119 --> 02:25:58.443]  You start figuring out a lot of this stuff has been scrubbed intentionally, and it continues to be scrubbed.
[02:25:58.443 --> 02:26:05.750]  That's why we continue to be the mouthpiece of the people here, making sure that people understand who these characters are before they're able to scrub their images off the internet.
[02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:09.854]  So then I guess what you're kind of leaning into here, but we don't have the answer is,
[02:26:10.774 --> 02:26:12.715]  Who is the wolf of crypto?
[02:26:12.715 --> 02:26:16.057]  Who is the wolf of FTX?
[02:26:16.057 --> 02:26:19.719]  And we don't know because the wolf is like an apparition.
[02:26:19.719 --> 02:26:22.220]  It's just nobody really is the wolf.
[02:26:22.220 --> 02:26:24.862]  You look and you climb the ladders and it's just, oh, there's nothing here.
[02:26:24.862 --> 02:26:26.763]  It's another ghost.
[02:26:26.763 --> 02:26:28.384]  So they knew what they were doing was illegal.
[02:26:29.392 --> 02:26:29.952]  Correct.
[02:26:29.952 --> 02:26:30.713]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:26:30.713 --> 02:26:40.320]  What they're going to try to do is they're going to try to pin it on what they're calling the Gang of Four, which is Caroline Ellison, Sam Bankman-Freed, Gary Wang, and I believe Amy Wu is the fourth piece there.
[02:26:40.320 --> 02:26:48.987]  They're going to try to tie those people together and say they were responsible for everything, while your Dan Friedbergs and whoever's above him get off scot-free.
[02:26:48.987 --> 02:26:50.288]  We've got to allow that not to happen.
[02:26:50.288 --> 02:26:53.530]  Let me pause you right there, because that's where I wanted to go next.
[02:26:53.530 --> 02:26:54.111]  And this was
[02:26:55.146 --> 02:27:04.340]  I was first doing my commentary on this last night because, again, I'm not really the crypto guy, so I had to do a lot of digging just to kind of get a better understanding of this.
[02:27:05.385 --> 02:27:12.688]  My initial response, I was saying last night, was clearly Freedman and the people you just mentioned, clearly they've been set up as fall guys.
[02:27:12.688 --> 02:27:16.029]  From the very beginning, they've been propped up as fall guys.
[02:27:16.029 --> 02:27:21.572]  I mean, no offense to Freedman and the girl, but I mean, look, you take one look at them, folks, they're probably not all there.
[02:27:21.572 --> 02:27:24.193]  I mean, I'm not trying to be rude, but they're probably on a spectrum.
[02:27:24.193 --> 02:27:27.154]  They probably maybe have some learning disabilities or something.
[02:27:27.154 --> 02:27:28.275]  They're not slick talk people.
[02:27:29.575 --> 02:27:38.703]  It's interesting you mention that because there's actually a lot of evidence that points back to all these people met at somewhere called the Center for Autistic Effectiveness or something like that.
[02:27:38.703 --> 02:27:48.831]  If people really want to start digging, you know, pulling on that thread, you'll find that it was almost like all of these people came together at the same time it was orchestrated even before any of this was launched.
[02:27:49.557 --> 02:27:50.398]  Well, let's dig into that.
[02:27:50.398 --> 02:27:52.080]  We're about to go to a break here in 60 seconds.
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:54.382]  But, I mean, again, I'm not trying to be rude.
[02:27:54.382 --> 02:27:57.445]  I've got friends that have had learning disabilities and everything.
[02:27:57.445 --> 02:27:58.947]  But, I mean, you can tell.
[02:27:58.947 --> 02:28:00.428]  I mean, you can tell they have tics.
[02:28:00.428 --> 02:28:04.933]  They have certain mannerisms, even sometimes a physiology.
[02:28:04.933 --> 02:28:05.934]  They have them all.
[02:28:05.934 --> 02:28:09.277]  And so you look at this now, and now that you're realizing, hey, wait a second.
[02:28:10.279 --> 02:28:12.280]  They were propped up as the face.
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:17.304]  They were propped up as the guys here, but now you're looking behind you're saying, wait a second, they were just full guys.
[02:28:17.304 --> 02:28:19.545]  They probably couldn't have come up with this on their own.
[02:28:19.545 --> 02:28:21.786]  They couldn't have financed all of this on their own.
[02:28:21.786 --> 02:28:23.087]  They didn't have the experience.
[02:28:23.087 --> 02:28:24.528]  They didn't have the connections.
[02:28:24.528 --> 02:28:27.330]  Now you start digging, you find out, okay, here were the connections.
[02:28:27.330 --> 02:28:29.111]  Here were the people with experience.
[02:28:29.111 --> 02:28:31.132]  And now here they are being set up personally.
[02:28:31.132 --> 02:28:31.773]  So, I mean, really?
[02:28:32.671 --> 02:28:33.892]  It's even worse, folks.
[02:28:33.892 --> 02:28:38.754]  We're not talking about just normal Ponzi schemes, money laundering, political influence.
[02:28:38.754 --> 02:28:44.756]  Now we're talking about these same people taking advantage of potentially mentally impaired and disabled people.
[02:28:44.756 --> 02:28:47.797]  So, I mean, this is about as evil as it gets.
[02:28:47.797 --> 02:28:51.959]  And of course, there it right is, all tied into the midterm elections and war in Ukraine.
[02:28:51.959 --> 02:28:53.740]  It's the same, it's just the same crap we deal with.
[02:28:53.860 --> 02:29:02.289]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:29:02.289 --> 02:29:03.310]  Here's why.
[02:29:03.310 --> 02:29:06.614]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:29:07.216 --> 02:29:12.337]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:29:12.337 --> 02:29:21.340]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:29.322]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:29:30.018 --> 02:29:36.102]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:29:36.102 --> 02:29:39.944]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:29:39.944 --> 02:29:41.945]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[02:29:58.826 --> 02:30:03.172]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:30:03.172 --> 02:30:14.366]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:30:15.307 --> 02:30:27.097]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[02:31:43.211 --> 02:31:46.577]  We're funded by viewers and listeners and patriots like you.

[02:31:48.980 --> 02:31:50.042]  The sale's about to end.
[02:31:50.042 --> 02:31:51.023]  Promo code 1776 for up to 60% off.
[02:31:54.970 --> 02:32:06.297]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:32:06.297 --> 02:32:08.178]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:32:08.178 --> 02:32:09.639]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:32:09.639 --> 02:32:11.160]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:12.821]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:32:12.821 --> 02:32:14.142]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:32:14.142 --> 02:32:15.963]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:32:15.963 --> 02:32:18.545]  I studied the Globalist 30 years ago, but I've been on here 28 years.
[02:32:19.125 --> 02:32:20.807]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:32:20.807 --> 02:32:23.190]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[02:32:23.190 --> 02:32:25.213]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:32:25.213 --> 02:32:32.161]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:32:32.794 --> 02:32:38.178]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:32:38.178 --> 02:32:47.125]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:32:47.125 --> 02:32:57.973]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:32:57.973 --> 02:33:00.615]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.954 --> 02:33:17.496]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:33:17.496 --> 02:33:19.737]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:19.737 --> 02:33:26.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.739 --> 02:33:31.441]  Well, of course, Ben Armstrong from BitBoyCrypto.com has all the information here.
[02:33:31.441 --> 02:33:35.202]  Every angle that I go to, he already has the info.
[02:33:35.202 --> 02:33:38.363]  And so I just want to kind of retouch on the issue of the Fall Guys here.
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:44.784]  Because I think it really illustrates the next level of evil we're dealing with.
[02:33:44.784 --> 02:33:59.576]  We're not dealing with some, maybe some younger people, some innovators that get involved with a trending thing right now, like cryptocurrency, and find ways to make money, or maybe they think they're going to spread the wealth or whatever, or maybe they think it's good causes they're helping to.
[02:33:59.576 --> 02:34:08.224]  No, clearly there were people on top of them, using them, leading them on, and again, you just take one look at these individuals,
[02:34:08.917 --> 02:34:13.921]  That are going to be used as the Fall Guys now and maybe successfully so.
[02:34:13.921 --> 02:34:14.661]  And it was pretty obvious.
[02:34:14.661 --> 02:34:16.543]  So let's just talk about that one more time here.
[02:34:16.543 --> 02:34:18.624]  Who do you think is going to be the Fall Boy?
[02:34:18.624 --> 02:34:21.106]  Why do you think it was always set up that way?
[02:34:21.106 --> 02:34:23.488]  But do you think that that's how it's going to finish up?
[02:34:23.488 --> 02:34:28.832]  Or will the real criminals be involved in the investigations here as well?
[02:34:28.832 --> 02:34:31.414]  Yeah, that's a great question.
[02:34:31.414 --> 02:34:37.098]  I certainly think that one thing that's different now than scandals in the past
[02:34:37.891 --> 02:34:41.313]  Is the voice of social media is so amplified now.
[02:34:41.313 --> 02:34:44.655]  Now, of course, there's deep political corruption you can't really touch, right?
[02:34:44.655 --> 02:34:52.999]  But when it comes to these criminal cases, especially something that, you know, definitely looks like, you know, it was not meant to happen.
[02:34:52.999 --> 02:34:55.440]  You know, like you said, it wasn't pre planned out for regulation.
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:57.321]  It doesn't look like they're going to use it for that.
[02:34:57.321 --> 02:34:59.382]  But it looks like there were some big mistakes made here.
[02:35:00.077 --> 02:35:10.142]  Is that our voice on amplifying the criminals involved in this, like your Dan Friedbergs and your Gary Wangs, I think it's enough to push these people into the spotlight.
[02:35:10.142 --> 02:35:15.725]  And you think, you know, you know, pressure, pressure is going to be felt by Gary Gensler.
[02:35:15.725 --> 02:35:17.286]  You know, he's going to feel the pressure.
[02:35:17.626 --> 02:35:22.690]  We've already got Tom Emmer out there talking about having hearings, questioning him about his meetings with SPF.
[02:35:22.690 --> 02:35:29.635]  He's got a lot of egg on his face, and so he's going to be really amped up to try to make sure that there are some fall guys, not just SPF.
[02:35:29.635 --> 02:35:36.220]  Because if SPF is the only fall guy, if SPF is the only villain here, then how bad does Gary Gensler look?
[02:35:36.660 --> 02:35:39.661]  And so he's having meetings with him time after time.
[02:35:39.661 --> 02:35:46.442]  One of only basically two people, Joseph Lubin of Consensus, another guy who has been able to meet with Gary Gensler.
[02:35:46.442 --> 02:35:49.002]  You can't just call Gary Gensler and get on the list.
[02:35:49.002 --> 02:36:00.045]  So the fact that SBF was of that level and having these kinds of meetings with him, I think it really shows the lack of judgment from Gary Gensler and he's going to be really itching to nail people down for this.
[02:36:00.045 --> 02:36:01.905]  So I think I do want to make one correction here.
[02:36:02.948 --> 02:36:13.152]  There is an account on Twitter called Autism Capital, and that supposedly is ran by Sam and also some of his buddies that work there.
[02:36:13.152 --> 02:36:22.055]  What I was actually referring to earlier, where all four of the founders of FTX met, it was actually the Center for Effective Altruism, not Autism, Altruism.
[02:36:22.055 --> 02:36:25.136]  They did all meet there, and somebody's laid out a pretty interesting scenario.
[02:36:25.136 --> 02:36:31.779]  It's kind of like, almost like the movie 21, the card counting scandal, where basically a teacher tied together all of these
[02:36:32.339 --> 02:36:47.410]  Uh, you know, people are able to count cards and pull them into its criminal scheme, uh, that maybe that Center for Effective Altruism was used as a linchpin to bring all these people in, uh, that had, you know, not all of them have autism, but we do believe, you know, probably Carolina and SBF did.
[02:36:47.410 --> 02:36:49.691]  And like you said, you know, it just is what it is.
[02:36:49.691 --> 02:36:52.353]  I mean, we're not trying to, you know, poke fun of these people.
[02:36:52.353 --> 02:36:57.797]  What we're saying is they were very easily used by people in power and people with authority.
[02:36:57.797 --> 02:37:01.540]  So I wonder when you look and when you listen to SBF,
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:13.124]  Some of the things that he said, especially if you look at, you know, this clip of him with Tom Brady, like, it looks really, it's really hard to believe that this was the guy who was in power in charge of the whole thing.
[02:37:13.124 --> 02:37:29.289]  When you listen to clips of him talk about altruism and wanting good and wanting effectiveness, you know, it really makes you wonder, like, somewhere deep within that Center for Effective Altruism was this basically brainwashed into these people's heads so they could get out and say the right talking points.
[02:37:29.289 --> 02:37:31.510]  Meanwhile, the people behind the scenes were doing all the dirty work.
[02:37:32.464 --> 02:37:34.313]  Yeah, and you know it's interesting too because...
[02:37:35.932 --> 02:37:41.216]  You wonder how much he was aware of what he was doing was illegal.
[02:37:41.216 --> 02:37:47.120]  You wonder of how much, you know, he was told, oh, you'll be fine, oh, don't worry about it, oh, we've got your back, whatever.
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.423]  And then the people that end up, you know, disappearing, stabbing him in the back.
[02:37:50.423 --> 02:37:54.205]  It's interesting, though, he did flee to the Bahamas.
[02:37:54.205 --> 02:37:56.387]  That was probably a decision that he made.
[02:37:56.387 --> 02:38:04.473]  Whether or not that was for, to go down there and do something, or he just thought, I need to get out of the States because I'm about to be arrested or investigated, we may not know.
[02:38:05.433 --> 02:38:13.598]  But I mean, moving forward, I see a situation here where if I am his lawyer, that would be my play.
[02:38:13.598 --> 02:38:28.366]  I would say, hey, look, I've got a client here who suffers from a learning disability or has some sort of, you know, spectrum autism here, and he was taken advantage of, and so we want the individuals that took advantage of him to be called to task here.
[02:38:29.125 --> 02:38:38.048]  I don't know how much of this, you know, SBF will be thinking about, but that would be my play as the lawyer, because I mean, that is, I think that that's a real element of this.
[02:38:38.048 --> 02:38:41.870]  Not to get him off the hook, but just to say, hey, let's, you know, let's look at all the players.
[02:38:42.955 --> 02:38:45.317]  Yeah, I mean, look at Jeffrey Dahmer.
[02:38:45.317 --> 02:38:46.578]  They tried for the insanity plea.
[02:38:46.578 --> 02:38:53.203]  I mean, it's a good way to go to be able to try to not get the harshest sentence or consequence you can get.
[02:38:53.203 --> 02:38:58.528]  And in this case, it could actually be used as a way to point fingers above him.
[02:38:58.528 --> 02:39:09.717]  And I think that this is really where it gets kind of dark, because when we're looking at SBF being portrayed as the fall guy here, and you're looking at if he were really to point fingers
[02:39:10.482 --> 02:39:13.645]  At the people behind the scenes that were really running this.
[02:39:40.842 --> 02:39:47.269]  If you start going down this rabbit trail and really who's in charge of all this thing, it can get pretty scary and pretty deep.
[02:39:47.269 --> 02:39:54.337]  When you start really touching on the Ukrainian situation, I shared a New York Times article from, I believe, April 2021 on my Twitter last night.
[02:39:56.181 --> 02:40:09.235]  You really start getting into how the Ukrainian government is tied in with the top crypto exchange, and how easy the money laundering is, and then you look at some of the things they actually brag about doing in that New York Times article.
[02:40:09.235 --> 02:40:11.378]  It gets very dark very quick.
[02:40:11.378 --> 02:40:16.123]  And so I definitely think, you know, watching that pipeline of money in between Ukraine and the United States is something to watch.
[02:40:16.743 --> 02:40:20.367]  And really, here's one thing that people really have to understand.
[02:40:20.367 --> 02:40:31.556]  We have a video that we've been showing on various articles of Dan Friedberg explaining that they literally counterfeited tokens on the exchanges.
[02:40:31.556 --> 02:40:41.025]  When you really start looking at how these flywheel coins were set up, how they counterfeited tokens, and then the money that was given to the Democratic Party, Joe Biden specifically,
[02:40:41.645 --> 02:40:49.997]  What you realize is they found a mechanism to print money out of nothing to make political donations with.
[02:40:49.997 --> 02:40:52.301]  And that's not even counting the money laundering aspect of this.
[02:40:52.301 --> 02:40:54.965]  So you're looking, in my opinion, you're looking at
[02:40:55.586 --> 02:41:04.569]  Counterfeiting, tax evasion, RICO laws, racketeering, when you really start adding up all the laws that were broken here, I mean, this is going to turn out to be a very massive case.
[02:41:04.569 --> 02:41:13.952]  Well, and you get into that, I want to come back and get into the Ukrainian issue on the other side, but when you get into the idea here, you know, maybe there's an analogy, but for people to understand,
[02:41:14.864 --> 02:41:17.406]  I mean, folks, they literally made up a currency.
[02:41:17.406 --> 02:41:33.939]  They literally made up a cryptocurrency that was their own in-house exchange currency, and they knew that they were just going to use it to inflate the value of their currency and then to basically launder money in and out, inflating the value with every transaction, as you mentioned earlier.
[02:41:33.939 --> 02:41:37.382]  And so again, now you go back to, is that really SBF's idea?
[02:41:37.382 --> 02:41:39.324]  Was that really Ellison's idea?
[02:41:39.324 --> 02:41:44.408]  Or was that a master money launderer who gave them that idea and said, this is how we're going to do it?
[02:41:45.856 --> 02:41:49.197]  Yeah, well, my best guess is Dan Freeberg is the architect here.
[02:41:49.197 --> 02:41:50.678]  He's the mastermind behind all of this.
[02:41:50.678 --> 02:42:02.943]  And like I said, we know this because the FTX game, when you really look at it, it looks different, it's packaged different, but it's the exact same game the Ultimate Bet used, previously, about 20 years earlier.
[02:42:03.423 --> 02:42:07.007]  So when you really break that down, it makes sense that he's the puppet master.
[02:42:07.007 --> 02:42:10.832]  The question is, is there someone above him?
[02:42:10.832 --> 02:42:11.552]  Because you're right.
[02:42:11.552 --> 02:42:17.279]  I mean, it just doesn't really seem like all of a sudden, you know, SVF just came up with all these ideas.
[02:42:17.279 --> 02:42:19.701]  Usually when you have an exchange, here's what's unique about FTX.
[02:42:20.462 --> 02:42:27.491]  When you have an exchange that creates its own token, like BNB for Binance, for example, it does something.
[02:42:27.491 --> 02:42:39.265]  Like, when it was first launched on Binance, you got utility, you got cheaper trading fees for using that coin to pay your trading fees with, a more natural way to inflate the price, I guess you could say, where as opposed to the FTT,
[02:42:40.386 --> 02:42:41.828]  It never did a single thing.
[02:42:41.828 --> 02:42:44.290]  It had zero utility on the platform.
[02:42:44.290 --> 02:42:49.114]  I mean, they're basically selling the equivalent of plastic coins and diamonds, folks.
[02:42:49.114 --> 02:42:56.600]  I mean, it'd be like a kiddie toy of plastic gold coins that you sold for real money.
[02:42:56.600 --> 02:42:58.642]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[02:42:59.426 --> 02:43:01.468]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[02:43:01.468 --> 02:43:03.470]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[02:43:03.470 --> 02:43:05.532]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[02:43:05.532 --> 02:43:07.273]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[02:43:07.273 --> 02:43:09.656]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[02:43:09.656 --> 02:43:11.097]  You forget to take DX3.
[02:43:11.097 --> 02:43:12.599]  And you know it makes your life better.
[02:43:12.599 --> 02:43:14.060]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[02:43:14.060 --> 02:43:15.221]  And you constantly forget.
[02:43:15.221 --> 02:43:17.183]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[02:43:17.822 --> 02:43:20.826]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[02:43:54.031 --> 02:43:56.534]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[02:43:56.534 --> 02:43:57.815]  Why is this taking so long?
[02:43:57.815 --> 02:44:01.299]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[02:44:01.299 --> 02:44:02.620]  Why can't we do this here?
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:05.123]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[02:44:05.123 --> 02:44:10.989]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.

[02:44:16.775 --> 02:44:27.367]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America First majority in every single one of them.
[02:44:27.367 --> 02:44:31.111]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[02:44:31.491 --> 02:44:34.394]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[02:44:34.394 --> 02:44:36.817]  Communications are the reason why we didn't well.

[02:46:53.447 --> 02:46:57.990]  Visit InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:46:57.990 --> 02:47:00.612]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.938 --> 02:47:34.265]  Final segment here with Ben Armstrong, BitBoyCrypto.com on Twitter at BitBoy underscore crypto.
[02:47:34.265 --> 02:47:37.348]  A couple other questions I have for him here.
[02:47:38.783 --> 02:47:47.606]  Now, in dealing with Ukraine, and we have some of the numbers, they say, I think it was $40 million to Democrats, $200,000 to Republicans.
[02:47:47.606 --> 02:47:55.209]  There's some other numbers we see going out as well, but I, looking more into this, I don't think this is the full picture.
[02:47:55.209 --> 02:48:06.373]  I don't think we're getting the full story here, because when you hear the numbers of $1 billion, $2 billion in supposed capital that they had, $400 million, or $40 million rather, is barely a drop in the bucket.
[02:48:07.248 --> 02:48:13.495]  I feel that they would have reached in with a much larger scoop, if you will, than just a little $40 million.
[02:48:13.495 --> 02:48:15.157]  Do you think we're getting the full numbers?
[02:48:15.157 --> 02:48:21.345]  Do you think we're getting the full story as far as how much money was actually laundered and spent during these midterms?
[02:48:21.345 --> 02:48:23.227]  Or do you think there's still more to be discovered here?
[02:48:24.338 --> 02:48:28.899]  No, I mean, I certainly think there is a lot more to be discovered here.
[02:48:28.899 --> 02:48:46.924]  I think one thing that's really interesting when you start digging into this and you start realizing, you know, how long this could have potentially been going on, when you look at how much money was raised in crypto alone for the war there in Ukraine, it's $135 million.
[02:48:46.924 --> 02:48:48.164]  And when you start thinking about that,
[02:48:52.185 --> 02:49:00.834]  You start wondering, okay, how much of this money actually came from, you know, how much of this money actually came from FTX in a roundabout way?
[02:49:00.834 --> 02:49:09.203]  The total amount that they raised in fiat for the Ukrainian effort, this article goes back, this is a Coindesk article, back in June, was about $600 million.
[02:49:09.203 --> 02:49:09.803]  They're saying about 25%
[02:49:12.746 --> 02:49:27.444]  Of those of that money raised came in through crypto at a time when crypto was dropping dramatically, making it much less advantageous for someone to send crypto as opposed to sending, you know, fiat or US dollars.
[02:49:27.444 --> 02:49:30.007]  So I think really digging into these numbers.
[02:49:30.939 --> 02:49:36.544]  And especially when you say, OK, 40 million versus 200,000, that doesn't sound quite accurate.
[02:49:36.544 --> 02:49:42.129]  So I think these are things I'm actually this is something I'm on the investigation trail of right now.
[02:49:42.129 --> 02:49:54.200]  People can tell from this New York Times article I posted last night on Twitter that I referenced, you know, I'm starting to really get into this Ukrainian angle and trying to figure out what happened here, because, look, at this point,
[02:49:55.023 --> 02:49:58.786]  I don't think there's anybody out there that believes that this did not happen.
[02:49:58.786 --> 02:50:10.133]  It is just a matter of trying to figure out the trail of what money went where, who it came back to, and the amount is definitely something that we've got to start looking into, and it's something I'm digging into now.
[02:50:10.905 --> 02:50:26.201]  And of course, it was our government, Washington D.C., the White House, that said, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not gonna be, no oversight of the funds, no oversights, no audits of the funds, we're sending all the money to Ukraine, you don't get to know where it goes, none of that.
[02:50:26.201 --> 02:50:30.025]  Oh, okay, maybe now we know why.
[02:50:30.025 --> 02:50:32.368]  Who are the victims of this crime, Ben?
[02:50:34.471 --> 02:50:36.493]  I mean, the victims of this crime are the holders.
[02:50:36.493 --> 02:50:39.475]  The victims of this crime are the people that have funds left on FTX.
[02:50:39.475 --> 02:51:02.294]  And not just FTX, but also the companies that have been left in the wake, including BlockFi, another large lending platform here in the United States that, you know, tons of larger, Anthony Pomplianos and your Peter McCormick, a lot of your really large kind of Bitcoin, primarily influencers, were really saying, you know, Graham Stephan, Andrei Zhiks, Meet Kevin, Mainstream Financial.
[02:51:03.074 --> 02:51:07.035]  YouTubers that aren't even in crypto are pushing this platform so heavily.
[02:51:07.035 --> 02:51:10.316]  And once again, I said this on my show earlier, like, I don't blame these people for doing it.
[02:51:10.316 --> 02:51:12.057]  It seemed like it was very safe.
[02:51:12.057 --> 02:51:18.019]  But how much money now has been lost and locked on these platforms because people were 100% behind them?
[02:51:18.019 --> 02:51:23.000]  I think the really important lesson for us going forward here in crypto is there's not a platform you can trust 100%.
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:28.802]  At the end of the day, the retail investors are always the ones that get stuck with these bills.
[02:51:29.358 --> 02:51:30.999]  We are seeing, of course, a lot of the hedge funds.
[02:51:30.999 --> 02:51:41.725]  There have been hedge funds that have been absolutely decimated by this, too, which is another reason why you know that this wasn't pre-planned out, in my opinion, because the hedge funds, the institutional money... They never lose.
[02:51:41.725 --> 02:51:42.005]  Right.
[02:51:42.005 --> 02:51:48.389]  So the fact that they've lost, I mean, there was a big one, a guy that came out, Travis Kling, a guy that was in charge of a big hedge fund today said,
[02:51:48.929 --> 02:51:51.590]  All their capital was locked up in FTX.
[02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:53.510]  You're going to see a lot of reverberating effects.
[02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:56.931]  But ultimately, as always, the losers in this are the people.
[02:51:56.931 --> 02:51:57.871]  The people of crypto.
[02:51:57.871 --> 02:52:00.911]  The people that have bought into something that's bigger than themselves.
[02:52:00.911 --> 02:52:06.913]  The people that bought into the idea of decentralization and that crypto is really a better way for us to do things.
[02:52:06.913 --> 02:52:10.113]  And at the end of the day, we've now watched it burn to the ground.
[02:52:10.113 --> 02:52:13.594]  And it's up to us, the people that have a voice in this space, to pick it back up.
[02:52:14.496 --> 02:52:18.008]  And to move forward and to assure people that we're not going to let this happen again.
[02:52:18.008 --> 02:52:20.236]  We can't let, and here's the real problem.
[02:52:20.822 --> 02:52:26.787]  The real problem is allowing the stock market 2.0 people to come into crypto.
[02:52:26.787 --> 02:52:32.631]  We've got to create alliances that keep these people out and push people towards more decentralized platforms.
[02:52:32.631 --> 02:52:36.394]  You know, look, if you're a trader, you're going to have to use an exchange at some point.
[02:52:36.394 --> 02:52:37.876]  That's a necessary evil.
[02:52:37.876 --> 02:52:44.561]  So there are exchanges that we do support that we think are OK, but we're never going to give 100% confidence in anything again.
[02:52:45.293 --> 02:52:48.715]  Well, and my final question for you was going to be, what is the state of crypto?
[02:52:48.715 --> 02:52:52.878]  But let me just ask you one more thing quickly here.
[02:52:52.878 --> 02:53:10.310]  The fact that of all the different cryptocurrencies and all the different trends and all the different hype and excitement and everything, it was FTX and SBF that were really the only ones introduced by the establishment, embraced by the establishment, sold to you by the establishment.
[02:53:10.310 --> 02:53:11.211]  What does that tell you?
[02:53:12.702 --> 02:53:15.205]  Yeah, well that tells me that's somebody we should be wary of.
[02:53:15.205 --> 02:53:16.547]  Someone we should be very scared of.
[02:53:16.547 --> 02:53:22.373]  Look, crypto was created, Bitcoin was created in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis.
[02:53:22.373 --> 02:53:25.557]  Where basically we were forced to bail out banks with our money.
[02:53:25.557 --> 02:53:27.820]  We paid taxes once and we had to bail them out twice.
[02:53:28.340 --> 02:53:31.642]  And it was a reaction to that, like, we should be our own banks.
[02:53:31.642 --> 02:53:37.224]  We should be able to make our own decisions with our money, not allow the government to just move it around and do whatever it wants.
[02:53:37.224 --> 02:53:39.465]  And we all know the fiat system is going to burn down 100%.
[02:53:39.465 --> 02:53:42.187]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:53:42.187 --> 02:53:44.628]  I believe USDC is going to become the digital dollar.
[02:53:44.628 --> 02:53:46.329]  It's going to kick the can down the road.
[02:53:46.329 --> 02:53:49.010]  But ultimately, you just can't print money out of nothing.
[02:53:49.010 --> 02:53:50.811]  And this is a lesson we've learned with FTX.
[02:53:50.811 --> 02:53:52.872]  You can't just print money out of nothing for no reason.
[02:53:53.385 --> 02:53:56.328]  There's no way that is a viable strategy for the long term.
[02:53:56.328 --> 02:54:00.511]  So eventually, it is going to burn down, you know, in that respect.
[02:54:00.511 --> 02:54:08.177]  But when you have the government, the very people that you don't trust so much, you created cryptocurrency out of, telling you, hey, these are the guys.
[02:54:08.177 --> 02:54:17.265]  You know, you got Kevin O'Leary on stage saying, well, you know, and once again, don't blame Kevin O'Leary for coming out and saying, well, there's one safe place you can go with your crypto.
[02:54:17.265 --> 02:54:18.386]  It's definitely FTX.
[02:54:18.386 --> 02:54:19.567]  You know everything's going to be fine.
[02:54:20.067 --> 02:54:23.469]  You know, we bought into that establishment lie, and we have to reject that.
[02:54:23.469 --> 02:54:33.814]  In crypto, we do a pretty good job of being skeptical and rejecting those types of behaviors, but this one here, for some reason, got under all of our noses and we didn't see it.
[02:54:33.814 --> 02:54:36.976]  All right, and just finally, what do you see the state of crypto right now?
[02:54:38.263 --> 02:54:40.764]  Yeah, the state of crypto is, here's what's funny.
[02:54:40.764 --> 02:54:47.966]  What's funny is, I'm what we call a strict four-year fundamentalist, four-year cycle fundamentalist in Bitcoin.
[02:54:47.966 --> 02:54:53.488]  When you look back at the history of Bitcoin, there's been a constant four-year cycle.
[02:54:53.488 --> 02:54:57.369]  You have an event called the Bitcoin halving, which basically cuts the production of Bitcoin in half.
[02:54:57.369 --> 02:55:02.191]  Right now, the average of 900 Bitcoin created per day in 2024, that number is going to get cut down to 450 per day.
[02:55:03.467 --> 02:55:05.070]  You have that halving event.
[02:55:05.070 --> 02:55:07.654]  They were in 2012, 2016, and 2020.
[02:55:07.654 --> 02:55:18.911]  That halving event leads to one and a half years of parabolic upward action, one year of a gigantic 85% drop, one and a half years of slowly rebuilding towards a halving.
[02:55:19.420 --> 02:55:20.920]  We are right on track.
[02:55:20.920 --> 02:55:29.103]  Nothing that's happened in the macro, nothing with inflation, nothing with Ukraine, nothing with this event so far has got us off track.
[02:55:29.103 --> 02:55:38.606]  I've said since the beginning of this year that we should see the bottom of Bitcoin at the end of November to the middle of December, sometime in that range based on the history of Bitcoin.
[02:55:39.355 --> 02:55:41.056]  We're still right on track for that.
[02:55:41.056 --> 02:55:42.497]  Bitcoin is still holding very well.
[02:55:42.497 --> 02:55:46.419]  We do think it's going to probably drop somewhere between $10,000 and $12,000.
[02:55:46.419 --> 02:55:55.865]  But unless we break that trend and we were to go, say, maybe below $8,000, there's no reason to think that we're going to see anything different in this cycle.
[02:55:55.865 --> 02:56:03.749]  Every single cycle, whether it's around the halving or around the all-time highs or around the bear market, you always hear people say, it's different this time.
[02:56:03.749 --> 02:56:07.031]  Look at the macro environment or look at this or look at that.
[02:56:07.031 --> 02:56:08.512]  And what we found in crypto is
[02:56:09.338 --> 02:56:13.181]  Bitcoin just keeps doing the same thing over and over and over again.
[02:56:13.181 --> 02:56:21.086]  The entire industry is pulled by Bitcoin, obviously, because even in times like this, while everything else is burning around it, Bitcoin is still fine.
[02:56:21.086 --> 02:56:26.289]  But the prices and the liquidations and the mass selling may come and may send the price down.
[02:56:26.289 --> 02:56:30.212]  But for guys like you, it's a good thing.
[02:56:30.212 --> 02:56:31.072]  What's that?
[02:56:31.072 --> 02:56:31.993]  When the price gets low.
[02:56:33.041 --> 02:56:35.022]  Well, yeah, it is, but it's not.
[02:56:35.022 --> 02:56:38.263]  Certainly, look, we like to accumulate at lower prices, but I'm for the people.
[02:56:38.263 --> 02:56:39.443]  Like, I like when people win.
[02:56:39.443 --> 02:56:42.724]  Like, it's not all about my personal portfolio and making money.
[02:56:42.724 --> 02:56:48.727]  I like it when people get into crypto and they win, and then they start sticking around for the ideals and the philosophies.
[02:56:48.727 --> 02:56:52.508]  You know, we say you come for the money and the Lambos, but you stick around because you love decentralized.
[02:56:52.568 --> 02:56:59.693]  Well, that's why I'm so glad we got you on today, because you're one of the few out there that I think keeps it level and keeps it grounded, and I appreciate that.
[02:56:59.693 --> 02:57:02.015]  An excellent commentary with us for the last hour.
[02:57:02.015 --> 02:57:04.276]  Ben Armstrong, bitboycrypto.com.
[02:57:04.276 --> 02:57:07.358]  Follow him at bitboy underscore crypto.
[02:57:07.358 --> 02:57:08.439]  Ben, great stuff as always.
[02:57:08.439 --> 02:57:09.340]  Thank you for joining us today.
[02:57:10.123 --> 02:57:11.104]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[02:57:11.104 --> 02:57:12.064]  Always enjoy it.
[02:57:12.064 --> 02:57:12.624]  Great stuff.
[02:57:12.624 --> 02:57:13.385]  I learned a lot, too.
[02:57:13.385 --> 02:57:20.309]  Again, I'm not the Bitcoin expert here, but when I talk to people about it, pretty much everything he just said is 100% spot on.
[02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:22.210]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm about to take an hour break.
[02:57:22.210 --> 02:57:23.790]  I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[02:57:23.790 --> 02:57:25.772]  Gerald Cilente, I believe, is about to take over.
[02:57:25.772 --> 02:57:27.593]  Folks, remember, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:27.593 --> 02:57:30.654]  None of this is possible without your support at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:57:40.075 --> 02:57:47.780]  And, of course, in the process, supporting free speech.
[02:57:47.780 --> 02:57:52.103]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[02:57:52.103 --> 02:58:03.310]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:16.022]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is Infowars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[02:58:16.022 --> 02:58:19.425]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are
[02:58:19.565 --> 02:58:20.545]  I am extremely honored.
[02:58:47.813 --> 02:58:51.377]  To be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:58:51.377 --> 02:59:00.507]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:59:00.507 --> 02:59:04.892]  They know if the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's game over.
[02:59:04.892 --> 02:59:09.837]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:59:10.552 --> 02:59:15.176]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:59:15.176 --> 02:59:21.802]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Band.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[02:59:21.802 --> 02:59:33.233]  And that's why when you go to Infowarsstore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[02:59:33.773 --> 02:59:39.875]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com, and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:39.875 --> 02:59:47.417]  God bless, and thank you all for your support.
[02:59:47.417 --> 02:59:50.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.218 --> 03:00:09.519]  Yep.
[03:00:09.519 --> 03:00:09.619]  1776.
[03:00:09.619 --> 03:00:10.840]  Spirit of 76.
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:14.101]  And that's what you need to do.
[03:00:14.101 --> 03:00:25.507]  You need to support InfoWars and do everything you can to get them what they need to keep going here.
[03:00:25.507 --> 03:00:30.969]  Because the future's in your hands, so don't drop it.
[03:00:30.969 --> 03:00:32.370]  InfoWars.
[03:00:32.370 --> 03:00:32.790]  Spirit of 1776.
[03:00:35.840 --> 03:00:41.141]  And it's so important because censorship is the new abnormal.
[03:00:41.141 --> 03:00:45.863]  And they're robbing us of our freedom day in and day out.
[03:00:45.863 --> 03:00:47.583]  I want to talk about the equity market.
[03:00:47.583 --> 03:00:50.824]  Because, you know, it's the bottom line.
[03:00:50.824 --> 03:00:55.305]  The bottom line is that people want to make money.
[03:00:55.305 --> 03:00:57.805]  Again, they're selling out their mega blowout sale.
[03:01:00.652 --> 03:01:02.173]  To help him blow it out.
[03:01:02.173 --> 03:01:04.774]  Because... 1776, by the way.
[03:01:04.774 --> 03:01:07.295]  I'm gonna be 76.
[03:01:07.295 --> 03:01:09.536]  Oh, my Lord.
[03:01:09.536 --> 03:01:11.597]  Later this month.
[03:01:11.597 --> 03:01:14.598]  When I was a kid, yeah, I grew up in a... I was born in the Bronx.
[03:01:14.598 --> 03:01:16.859]  I lived there for quite a while.
[03:01:16.859 --> 03:01:19.641]  And, uh, grew up enough there.
[03:01:19.641 --> 03:01:24.883]  And, um... I was so out of control.
[03:01:24.883 --> 03:01:26.644]  I was the youngest of five.
[03:01:26.644 --> 03:01:27.124]  I'm born in 1946.
[03:01:29.255 --> 03:01:34.179]  Right at the height, America's at its height, you know, right after World War II.
[03:01:34.179 --> 03:01:39.904]  And they used to say to me, you little S.O.B., you're not going to make it till 21.
[03:01:39.904 --> 03:01:42.886]  I heard that.
[03:01:42.886 --> 03:01:45.228]  I heard that almost at times, 21.
[03:01:45.228 --> 03:01:48.531]  The trouble I used to get into, the stuff I used to pull.
[03:01:48.531 --> 03:01:54.415]  Anyway, going back to the markets.
[03:01:54.415 --> 03:01:55.116]  Here's the deal.
[03:01:55.116 --> 03:01:58.719]  After
[03:02:00.124 --> 03:02:04.646]  40 midterm elections.
[03:02:04.646 --> 03:02:27.416]  The S&P 500 has gone up some, let's see, 15% in the following 12 months.
[03:02:27.416 --> 03:02:28.276]  So those are the facts.
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:38.665]  And the midterm elections didn't come out the way the repulsive Finns thought they would.
[03:02:38.665 --> 03:02:45.169]  So, again, you can't forecast this because the game is rigged.
[03:02:45.169 --> 03:02:52.293]  They have a thing called a plunge protection team, the markets go down too deep, they pump the markets up.
[03:02:52.293 --> 03:02:54.915]  Federal Reserve.
[03:02:54.915 --> 03:02:55.115]  So,
[03:02:56.491 --> 03:03:03.195]  The trend line is, though, that the markets are going to go up.
[03:03:03.195 --> 03:03:04.696]  And gold.
[03:03:04.696 --> 03:03:06.998]  Gold is at $17.76.
[03:03:06.998 --> 03:03:10.280]  The spirit is $76.
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:16.363]  We have forecast in the Trends Journal that gold hit its bottom a couple of weeks ago.
[03:03:16.363 --> 03:03:25.269]  Now, you're also hearing more and more about the Fed banksters lowering
[03:03:26.187 --> 03:03:31.091]  We're not raising interest rates as much as they said that they would.
[03:03:31.091 --> 03:03:32.812]  So here we go.
[03:03:32.812 --> 03:03:42.659]  Fed Vice Chair Brain Hard says it may soon be appropriate to move to slower pace of rate hike.
[03:03:42.659 --> 03:03:48.984]  Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lyle Brain Hard, Brain Dead, Brain Hard, Brain Dead,
[03:03:50.177 --> 03:03:51.218]  Member of the Club.
[03:03:51.218 --> 03:03:55.119]  Boy, they put this picture up of her on CNBC.
[03:03:55.119 --> 03:03:57.200]  I mean, she got rings on every finger.
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:03:59.021]  She got one on her thumb.
[03:03:59.021 --> 03:04:02.063]  I don't look at this anyway.
[03:04:02.063 --> 03:04:13.308]  She, um... He's saying that they could slow down the pace of its interest rate increases.
[03:04:13.308 --> 03:04:17.030]  Now, let's put this into perspective.
[03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.630]  You have...
[03:04:19.210 --> 03:04:31.276]  A 17, a 7.7 percent, 7.7 percent inflation rate.
[03:04:31.276 --> 03:04:37.439]  What do you have, like a 3.5, 3.75 interest rate?
[03:04:37.439 --> 03:04:40.941]  Your interest rates are in negative territory.
[03:04:40.941 --> 03:04:41.361]  Got it?
[03:04:47.188 --> 03:04:50.735]  And now they're not going to raise them that much.
[03:04:50.735 --> 03:04:57.127]  So they can keep artificially pumping up the economy.
[03:04:57.127 --> 03:04:59.171]  I'm pointing my finger at you!
[03:04:59.955 --> 03:05:01.978]  And I'm also pointing right back at myself.
[03:05:01.978 --> 03:05:03.980]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:06.063]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[03:05:06.063 --> 03:05:07.785]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[03:05:07.785 --> 03:05:10.188]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[03:05:10.188 --> 03:05:11.610]  You forget to take the X3.
[03:05:11.610 --> 03:05:13.112]  And you know it makes your life better.
[03:05:13.112 --> 03:05:14.574]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[03:05:14.574 --> 03:05:15.735]  And you constantly forget.
[03:05:15.735 --> 03:05:17.698]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[03:05:18.351 --> 03:05:21.312]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[03:05:46.037 --> 03:05:46.557]  1770 for Store.com.
[03:05:59.176 --> 03:06:00.936]  The answer to 1984-1766.
[03:06:00.936 --> 03:06:10.138]  You're listening to The Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:06:10.138 --> 03:06:19.900]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:26.341]  As they're saying, you know, they say the markets are rigged.
[03:06:26.341 --> 03:06:27.761]  And everybody has to get that.
[03:06:29.332 --> 03:06:36.236]  That they're going to do everything they can to keep the interest rates going up.
[03:06:36.236 --> 03:06:39.457]  Going lower, rather, and pump up the economy.
[03:06:39.457 --> 03:06:42.039]  So that's where we see it going.
[03:06:42.039 --> 03:06:45.501]  And you look at what's going on with oil prices.
[03:06:45.501 --> 03:06:50.383]  It's very important to take a globalnomic view.
[03:06:50.383 --> 03:06:52.704]  To look at the future.
[03:06:52.704 --> 03:06:53.465]  And that means...
[03:06:54.804 --> 03:06:56.944]  What in the world is going on?
[03:06:56.944 --> 03:07:02.646]  People just concentrated on what's going on in the United States.
[03:07:02.646 --> 03:07:07.167]  How about what's going on in China?
[03:07:07.167 --> 03:07:09.247]  They got their zero COVID policy.
[03:07:09.247 --> 03:07:14.688]  They were taking it off later this week, earlier this week, or the end of last week.
[03:07:14.688 --> 03:07:17.489]  And now they're, you know, they're going to make travel easier.
[03:07:17.489 --> 03:07:20.070]  They weren't eliminating it.
[03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:21.970]  And now the case rate is going up.
[03:07:24.742 --> 03:07:30.505]  So now they're imposing more COVID restrictions.
[03:07:30.505 --> 03:07:39.469]  This is hurting not only the Chinese economy, but everybody that sells to the Chinese.
[03:07:39.469 --> 03:07:44.171]  So now you look at Brent crude prices.
[03:07:44.171 --> 03:07:47.052]  And the oil prices are going down.
[03:07:47.052 --> 03:07:50.874]  Because the economy is slowing down.
[03:07:50.874 --> 03:07:53.335]  China is the second largest economy in the world.
[03:07:55.174 --> 03:07:56.195]  This is big.
[03:07:56.195 --> 03:07:57.675]  There's 1.4 billion people.
[03:07:57.675 --> 03:07:59.156]  What do we got over here?
[03:07:59.156 --> 03:08:05.039]  We don't even have the .4.
[03:08:05.039 --> 03:08:06.400]  We got what?
[03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:07.961]  332 million.
[03:08:07.961 --> 03:08:16.625]  So if they're cutting back on their spending, they're cutting back on their manufacturing.
[03:08:16.625 --> 03:08:18.466]  This is serious.
[03:08:18.466 --> 03:08:20.067]  Now we take a trip to Europe.
[03:08:21.937 --> 03:08:23.578]  Remember when B.S.
[03:08:23.578 --> 03:08:28.321]  Biden said we're going to punish Putin?
[03:08:28.321 --> 03:08:41.688]  And by punishing Putin, by putting the sanctions on Russia, they punish the people.
[03:08:41.688 --> 03:08:44.550]  The energy prices in Europe are skyrocketing.
[03:08:46.573 --> 03:09:00.821]  You're looking at over a hundred thousand small and medium-sized businesses in Italy going out of business.
[03:09:00.821 --> 03:09:01.562]  New York.
[03:09:01.562 --> 03:09:03.323]  New York is nothing compared to it.
[03:09:03.323 --> 03:09:10.187]  There's some hotspots in New York, you know, the east side, west side, down the villages, you know, but the rest of it, nothing compared to what it was.
[03:09:12.276 --> 03:09:23.445]  This COVID war has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people and now the Ukraine war with the sanctions.
[03:09:23.445 --> 03:09:36.976]  If the United States and NATO did not keep funding the Ukraine war, it would have been over a long time ago.
[03:09:36.976 --> 03:09:40.119]  The sanctions would be off, it would be over, people wouldn't care.
[03:09:41.221 --> 03:09:44.803]  You think people really care about what was going on between Ukraine and Russia?
[03:09:44.803 --> 03:09:50.227]  I mean, there you got it.
[03:09:50.227 --> 03:09:54.450]  Europe's energy crisis.
[03:09:54.450 --> 03:09:56.231]  Again, they're doing this for propaganda.
[03:09:56.231 --> 03:09:59.513]  They've been doing it all along.
[03:09:59.513 --> 03:10:02.895]  They're taking down a statue of Catherine the Great over there in Odessa.
[03:10:02.895 --> 03:10:06.077]  The place where she founded, they say.
[03:10:06.077 --> 03:10:07.398]  Back in what, 1750?
[03:10:07.398 --> 03:10:08.279]  Because they hate her?
[03:10:09.235 --> 03:10:14.396]  You mean it's been going on between 1750 between the Russians and the Ukrainians?
[03:10:14.396 --> 03:10:17.257]  And you want me to get involved in it as an American?
[03:10:17.257 --> 03:10:22.438]  I saw some clown boy yesterday driving by holding up a sign, Support Ukraine.
[03:10:22.438 --> 03:10:29.799]  Hey, you want to go support Ukraine, go over there and support them, send your money, leave me out of it!
[03:10:29.799 --> 03:10:33.480]  There are protests going on all across Europe!
[03:10:37.566 --> 03:10:42.531]  Last week over 100,000 Italians took to the streets.
[03:10:42.531 --> 03:10:50.037]  They don't want to send any more armaments, any more money.
[03:10:50.037 --> 03:10:54.501]  Because?
[03:10:54.501 --> 03:10:58.685]  They're going out of business.
[03:10:58.685 --> 03:11:03.770]  They can't afford to pay for their gas and oil.
[03:11:09.770 --> 03:11:16.093]  And now the bragging over there, and by the way, who bombed this Nord Stream Pipeline?
[03:11:16.093 --> 03:11:24.737]  The Swedes did a study on it and refuse, refuse to provide the information.
[03:11:24.737 --> 03:11:31.981]  Again, there you have it, the protests going on, one after another, but nothing in the United States.
[03:11:31.981 --> 03:11:35.662]  The dead woke America!
[03:11:35.662 --> 03:11:36.583]  No protests.
[03:11:37.896 --> 03:11:49.426]  Again, I had the Occupy Peace Rally here, and Judge Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Noll, Phil Giraldi, no coverage at all.
[03:11:49.426 --> 03:11:52.648]  Peace is a dirty word.
[03:11:52.648 --> 03:11:59.234]  So going back to putting this all together, you're going to see a new world disorder.
[03:11:59.234 --> 03:12:03.758]  When people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:12:03.758 --> 03:12:05.099]  America had an election.
[03:12:06.767 --> 03:12:08.968]  It was worthless.
[03:12:08.968 --> 03:12:13.589]  The Democrats were the repulsive kind.
[03:12:13.589 --> 03:12:17.030]  You know what the difference over there in Europe is?
[03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:20.992]  New third parties, the old ones, are getting pushed out.
[03:12:20.992 --> 03:12:25.013]  Not everywhere, but in a lot of places.
[03:12:25.013 --> 03:12:33.476]  Here is the same crime syndicate that's been running the show for what, the last hundred and something years?
[03:12:34.870 --> 03:12:42.192]  It's almost impossible to get on a ballot.
[03:12:42.192 --> 03:12:44.773]  Yep, Americans should prepare for the worst.
[03:12:44.773 --> 03:12:50.494]  Oh, oh, Bezos gave Dolly Parton, what, $100 million?
[03:12:50.494 --> 03:12:52.315]  I looked up, how much is she worth?
[03:12:52.315 --> 03:12:54.055]  $350 million.
[03:12:54.055 --> 03:12:55.896]  And he gave her $100 million?
[03:12:55.896 --> 03:12:58.897]  Hey, how about some money for Occupy Peace?
[03:12:58.897 --> 03:12:59.357]  Peace?
[03:12:59.357 --> 03:13:01.817]  The hell with you, Celenti!
[03:13:01.817 --> 03:13:03.638]  No peace!
[03:13:05.822 --> 03:13:09.144]  What kind of jerk are you?
[03:13:09.144 --> 03:13:14.826]  We only give our money to the club.
[03:13:14.826 --> 03:13:16.647]  Oh, and they all promoted the Vax.
[03:13:16.647 --> 03:13:18.448]  I remember Dolly Parton.
[03:13:18.448 --> 03:13:19.769]  Oh, I love the Vax.
[03:13:19.769 --> 03:13:20.969]  Oh, I love the Vax.
[03:13:20.969 --> 03:13:21.590]  Yeah.
[03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:24.071]  One after another.
[03:13:24.071 --> 03:13:25.832]  George Carlin said it.
[03:13:25.832 --> 03:13:30.514]  One big club and you ain't in it.
[03:13:30.514 --> 03:13:32.035]  A hundred million bucks.
[03:13:33.098 --> 03:13:36.959]  Not a penny for peace from any of these billionaires.
[03:13:36.959 --> 03:13:39.139]  All they do is support the war machine.
[03:13:39.139 --> 03:13:43.620]  Hey, Bezos, go fight!
[03:13:43.620 --> 03:13:47.961]  All you guys that want war, go fight!
[03:13:47.961 --> 03:13:51.182]  Yep.
[03:13:51.182 --> 03:13:53.242]  And he says he's gonna get rid of all his money.
[03:13:53.242 --> 03:13:55.483]  Yeah, he's gonna donate it.
[03:13:55.483 --> 03:13:59.943]  Donate it to what?
[03:13:59.943 --> 03:14:02.684]  So anyway, going back to the economy, all things are connected.
[03:14:04.150 --> 03:14:05.731]  This thing's going down big and hard.
[03:14:05.731 --> 03:14:09.054]  Now winter's coming.
[03:14:09.054 --> 03:14:15.038]  You're gonna see energy prices skyrocket.
[03:14:15.038 --> 03:14:17.079]  Yep.
[03:14:17.079 --> 03:14:18.761]  And, you can see the effects.
[03:14:18.761 --> 03:14:23.904]  Like they say, Amazon's ready to lay off, what, thousands of employees.
[03:14:23.904 --> 03:14:26.426]  Facebook, or Meta, excuse me.
[03:14:26.426 --> 03:14:28.047]  Yeah, Meta.
[03:14:28.047 --> 03:14:28.628]  Metagots.
[03:14:32.216 --> 03:14:33.077]  One after another.
[03:14:33.077 --> 03:14:37.119]  Every week in the Trends Journal, we have the layoffs.
[03:14:37.119 --> 03:14:38.761]  Every week.
[03:14:38.761 --> 03:14:41.803]  And they keep adding up, and adding up, and adding up.
[03:14:41.803 --> 03:14:42.963]  But don't worry about it.
[03:14:42.963 --> 03:14:47.286]  The bigs are getting bigger.
[03:14:47.286 --> 03:14:49.588]  And the mom and pops are gone.
[03:14:49.588 --> 03:14:50.489]  Dead.
[03:14:50.489 --> 03:14:52.290]  Killing them.
[03:14:52.290 --> 03:14:55.112]  They're taking over everything.
[03:14:55.112 --> 03:14:58.534]  Housing.
[03:14:58.534 --> 03:14:59.515]  Chain stores.
[03:14:59.515 --> 03:15:01.316]  Didn't we have chain stores when I was a kid?
[03:15:02.322 --> 03:15:03.243]  Chains own everything.
[03:15:03.243 --> 03:15:05.744]  We're chained.
[03:15:05.744 --> 03:15:06.925]  You gotta go to Home Depot.
[03:15:06.925 --> 03:15:08.646]  You can't go to your local hardware store anymore.
[03:15:08.646 --> 03:15:10.507]  They're out of business.
[03:15:10.507 --> 03:15:12.188]  Stationary stores are out of business.
[03:15:12.188 --> 03:15:17.371]  Now you gotta go to state.
[03:15:17.371 --> 03:15:19.812]  Yep.
[03:15:19.812 --> 03:15:20.753]  That's the story.
[03:15:20.753 --> 03:15:23.935]  It's just getting worse.
[03:15:23.935 --> 03:15:27.517]  With the economy going down, equity markets going up.
[03:15:30.643 --> 03:15:32.185]  That's the way we see it so far.
[03:15:32.185 --> 03:15:33.347]  Again, going by the trend.
[03:15:42.995 --> 03:15:49.358]  What if you could cut your heating bills this winter with your existing wood-burning fireplace and not spend thousands doing it?
[03:15:49.358 --> 03:15:52.320]  You can with Great Wall of Fire Fireplace Grates.

[03:16:13.220 --> 03:16:14.180]  Hey everybody!
[03:16:14.180 --> 03:16:19.683]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[03:16:19.683 --> 03:16:22.124]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.

[03:16:22.964 --> 03:16:27.266]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[03:16:27.266 --> 03:16:28.627]  Survival soup beans.
[03:16:28.627 --> 03:16:36.811]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[03:16:36.811 --> 03:16:37.351]  The best part?

[03:17:12.535 --> 03:17:13.756]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:13.756 --> 03:17:17.679]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:17.679 --> 03:17:19.200]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:19.200 --> 03:17:22.162]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:22.162 --> 03:17:27.725]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:27.725 --> 03:17:28.926]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:28.926 --> 03:17:31.868]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:31.868 --> 03:17:34.090]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:34.090 --> 03:17:38.533]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:38.533 --> 03:17:40.874]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:47.717 --> 03:17:52.058]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[03:17:52.058 --> 03:18:03.661]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:18:03.661 --> 03:18:10.022]  And their number one most hated enemy in the media is InfoWars because we know the globalists
[03:18:10.162 --> 03:18:15.964]  We know their number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.

[03:19:22.943 --> 03:19:24.364]  Infowarstore.com.

[03:19:25.704 --> 03:19:30.546]  DNA Force Plus, Brain Force Ultra, Supramel Vitality, Physic Magnesium.

[03:19:47.325 --> 03:20:06.178]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:06.178 --> 03:20:09.560]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:09.560 --> 03:20:13.243]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente!
[03:20:16.397 --> 03:20:27.286]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show, and as I keep saying, do everything you can to support InfoWars, because censorship is the new normal.
[03:20:27.286 --> 03:20:33.351]  Remember they call it misinformation when you won't swallow the crap that they spew out.
[03:20:33.351 --> 03:20:40.097]  Go back to the COVID war when it began, and they started hyping the COVID jab.
[03:20:40.097 --> 03:20:40.397]  96% efficacy rate.
[03:20:44.747 --> 03:20:45.868]  That's what they sold it at.
[03:20:45.868 --> 03:20:48.330]  Two shots will do you.
[03:20:48.330 --> 03:20:51.392]  And boy, oh boy, did that change.
[03:20:51.392 --> 03:20:56.416]  And then all the clowns that got all the shots, all the boosters, gets all the COVID.
[03:20:56.416 --> 03:20:58.378]  But boy, I'm happy I got it.
[03:20:58.378 --> 03:20:59.779]  Misinformation.
[03:20:59.779 --> 03:21:01.480]  And by the way, that's sexist.
[03:21:01.480 --> 03:21:04.503]  We should not call it misinformation anymore.
[03:21:04.503 --> 03:21:06.764]  We should call it gender information.
[03:21:06.764 --> 03:21:08.586]  Let's really be stupid.
[03:21:09.582 --> 03:21:11.302]  And again, support InfoWars.
[03:21:11.302 --> 03:21:16.244]  So, go to InfoWarsStores.com and get what you get.
[03:21:16.244 --> 03:21:18.304]  You know, what we do is trend forecasting.
[03:21:18.304 --> 03:21:20.225]  We're the only magazine in the world.
[03:21:20.225 --> 03:21:23.246]  Only trend forecasting magazine in the world.
[03:21:23.246 --> 03:21:27.327]  And remember, the trend is your friend.
[03:21:27.327 --> 03:21:33.748]  They don't teach trend forecasting at Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Oxford, Cambridge, none of them.
[03:21:33.748 --> 03:21:34.289]  You know why?
[03:21:34.289 --> 03:21:35.909]  They don't know how to do it.
[03:21:37.088 --> 03:21:39.489]  Yeah, but you can get a degree in history.
[03:21:39.489 --> 03:21:47.552]  Yeah, we'll give you some baloney that we'll make up that we'll tell you happened years ago.
[03:21:47.552 --> 03:21:54.694]  I had a buddy up here the other week, this weekend, and we're talking about how, you know, we don't know anything about the future.
[03:21:54.694 --> 03:22:04.558]  And I looked up, I said, you know, I wonder when they first, the first skull, you know, they say the world all began like, you know, like, you know, like,
[03:22:07.397 --> 03:22:11.798]  1,500 years ago, some stupid, you know, well, you know, some stupid number, you know.
[03:22:11.798 --> 03:22:13.159]  2,000 years ago.
[03:22:13.159 --> 03:22:13.259]  2022.
[03:22:13.259 --> 03:22:18.120]  And, uh, I think the skull they found was like 230,000 years old.
[03:22:18.120 --> 03:22:20.941]  In other words, we don't have a clue.
[03:22:20.941 --> 03:22:21.761]  And they distort history.
[03:22:33.934 --> 03:22:44.300]  And one of the great distortions you're seeing right in front of your eyes right now is that they blame certain things like the mental illness of children.
[03:22:44.300 --> 03:22:47.722]  Again, an article in this week's Trends Journal.
[03:22:47.722 --> 03:22:53.226]  The failure of children in school.
[03:22:53.226 --> 03:22:57.248]  The amount of suicides.
[03:22:57.248 --> 03:23:00.990]  The increases of crime.
[03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:03.452]  They blame it, quote, on the pandemic.
[03:23:05.000 --> 03:23:06.521]  No, no.
[03:23:06.521 --> 03:23:07.862]  Not the pandemic.
[03:23:07.862 --> 03:23:11.864]  Blame it on the politicians that locked everything down.
[03:23:11.864 --> 03:23:19.829]  I ask my friends and people I know, how many people do you know that died of COVID?
[03:23:19.829 --> 03:23:22.951]  Remember, they're calling it a pandemic.
[03:23:22.951 --> 03:23:25.492]  How many people do you know?
[03:23:25.492 --> 03:23:31.356]  Well, I don't know anybody, but a friend of mine's friend's friend, you know, that kind of stuff.
[03:23:31.356 --> 03:23:32.296]  Or I knew someone who was 88 years old.
[03:23:33.644 --> 03:23:37.406]  Yeah, the average age in America is 78, okay?
[03:23:37.406 --> 03:23:38.706]  Of death.
[03:23:38.706 --> 03:23:39.527]  Death age of men.
[03:23:39.527 --> 03:23:42.488]  88, phew, had a good run.
[03:23:42.488 --> 03:23:44.989]  Would've lived forever if it wasn't COVID.
[03:23:44.989 --> 03:23:48.291]  Would've lived to 188.
[03:23:48.291 --> 03:23:52.953]  So, I'm saying they distort history, they don't talk about trends.
[03:23:52.953 --> 03:23:59.816]  And that's why I want to continue to talk about the importance of the geopolitical trends taking place.
[03:24:01.184 --> 03:24:09.593]  And of course, the biggest one right on the scale right now is what's going on over there in Ukraine.
[03:24:09.593 --> 03:24:14.478]  And today, the Ukrainian president, the guy that used to play a comedian on TV,
[03:24:16.758 --> 03:24:22.319]  And his role on TV was playing the President of Ukraine in a sitcom.
[03:24:22.319 --> 03:24:25.360]  And he played the piano with his penis.
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:26.941]  I'm not making that up.
[03:24:26.941 --> 03:24:29.621]  And then he becomes the President of Ukraine.
[03:24:29.621 --> 03:24:35.243]  Yeah, that guy, Vladimir Zelensky.
[03:24:35.243 --> 03:24:42.444]  He made his first visit to Kursan, where they're taking over part of where Russia pulled back.
[03:24:42.444 --> 03:24:44.305]  And he hailed the Russian withdrawal, quote,
[03:24:46.821 --> 03:24:47.782]  Yep, there he is.
[03:24:47.782 --> 03:24:53.006]  As the beginning of the end of the war.
[03:24:53.006 --> 03:24:56.009]  This is the beginning of the end of the war.
[03:24:56.009 --> 03:25:04.195]  We are step by step coming to all the temporarily occupied territories.
[03:25:04.195 --> 03:25:05.056]  You know what that is.
[03:25:05.056 --> 03:25:10.520]  What are you kidding me?
[03:25:10.520 --> 03:25:13.763]  He just took back that much.
[03:25:13.763 --> 03:25:15.304]  Russia still has over 20%.
[03:25:19.286 --> 03:25:21.548]  Here he is.
[03:25:21.548 --> 03:25:22.008]  That's him.
[03:25:22.008 --> 03:25:25.932]  Isn't that great?
[03:25:25.932 --> 03:25:30.095]  That's who's running the show.
[03:25:30.095 --> 03:25:32.617]  Playing the piano with his penis.
[03:25:32.617 --> 03:25:34.719]  Not making this up.
[03:25:34.719 --> 03:25:36.240]  He's some jerk.
[03:25:36.240 --> 03:25:40.604]  Off over there in Ukraine.
[03:25:40.604 --> 03:25:43.767]  These are who's running our country.
[03:25:43.767 --> 03:25:45.168]  It's no different.
[03:25:45.168 --> 03:25:46.569]  You got little Chucky Schumer.
[03:25:49.364 --> 03:25:50.885]  Mitch McConnell.
[03:25:50.885 --> 03:25:54.387]  Cat got more chins than Chinatown.
[03:25:54.387 --> 03:25:58.910]  Lowlife Lindsey Graham.
[03:25:58.910 --> 03:26:00.791]  Adam Schiff.
[03:26:00.791 --> 03:26:02.833]  I can't spell it right.
[03:26:02.833 --> 03:26:07.416]  But there's an S and H in there, too.
[03:26:07.416 --> 03:26:09.997]  One little jerk after another.
[03:26:09.997 --> 03:26:12.379]  That is global.
[03:26:12.379 --> 03:26:15.000]  You got that little Katson Macron over there in France.
[03:26:15.000 --> 03:26:17.382]  Nothing of a boy with an arrogant attitude.
[03:26:20.194 --> 03:26:25.017]  The world is going down big time, which goes back to me with gold.
[03:26:25.017 --> 03:26:36.042]  Gold, and I don't give financial advice, is the number one safe haven asset, and I believe the prices have bottomed.
[03:26:36.042 --> 03:26:39.304]  And now they're talking about not raising interest rates.
[03:26:39.304 --> 03:26:42.846]  I just read you the article.
[03:26:42.846 --> 03:26:45.347]  As rapidly as they said they were going to.
[03:26:45.347 --> 03:26:47.408]  And they're still very low compared to inflation.
[03:26:48.863 --> 03:26:53.885]  That means inflation is going to keep going up, but the dollar is going to get weaker.
[03:26:53.885 --> 03:26:59.867]  And they're doing this too, because the dollar is only getting strong because the other currencies are so weak.
[03:26:59.867 --> 03:27:06.809]  So the higher the interest rates go, the stronger the dollar goes, but the deeper all the other world economies go down.
[03:27:06.809 --> 03:27:09.730]  Because they have a lot of money borrowed in dollar.
[03:27:09.730 --> 03:27:11.210]  Dollar debt.
[03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:14.852]  So the lower their currency goes, the more they have to pay back.
[03:27:14.852 --> 03:27:15.992]  And they can't afford to do it.
[03:27:20.467 --> 03:27:26.788]  So they're not raising interest rates because the whole global economy is going down.
[03:27:26.788 --> 03:27:29.269]  And that's what you have to focus on.
[03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:31.789]  This is deadly serious.
[03:27:31.789 --> 03:27:47.112]  France, Spain, Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, one Czech Republic, one country after another, major demonstrations, people, Belgium,
[03:27:47.691 --> 03:27:49.592]  Taking to the streets.
[03:27:49.592 --> 03:27:51.714]  But not in America.
[03:27:51.714 --> 03:27:53.495]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:27:53.495 --> 03:27:54.836]  No.
[03:27:54.836 --> 03:27:57.077]  It's dead woke.
[03:27:57.077 --> 03:27:59.258]  Dead woke, swallow the crap.
[03:27:59.258 --> 03:28:02.140]  If you don't swallow my crap, then I don't like you.
[03:28:02.140 --> 03:28:05.682]  That's the America of today.
[03:28:05.682 --> 03:28:08.904]  So it's important to take a global nomic view.
[03:28:08.904 --> 03:28:11.666]  And all things are connected.
[03:28:11.666 --> 03:28:15.889]  Or as they said, all things are connected like the blood which unites us all, said Chief Seattle.
[03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:20.562]  You can't call him an Indian anymore either.
[03:28:20.562 --> 03:28:21.522]  No, he's not from India.
[03:28:21.522 --> 03:28:22.583]  He's indigenous.
[03:28:22.583 --> 03:28:23.364]  Don't get blah blah blah.
[03:28:23.364 --> 03:28:24.144]  Take it easy.
[03:28:24.144 --> 03:28:26.806]  Take it easy.
[03:28:26.806 --> 03:28:31.369]  So, watch gold and watch oil prices.
[03:28:31.369 --> 03:28:35.973]  Oil prices are going down because China's going down.
[03:28:35.973 --> 03:28:39.015]  And now they're talking about protecting Taiwan against China.
[03:28:39.015 --> 03:28:40.136]  Listen, we're gonna take a break.
[03:28:40.136 --> 03:28:41.457]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:41.457 --> 03:28:41.757]  Hang on.
[03:28:43.317 --> 03:28:57.188]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:28:57.188 --> 03:29:02.512]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I've got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:29:02.512 --> 03:29:03.213]  But it's true.
[03:29:03.213 --> 03:29:06.636]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:29:07.356 --> 03:29:08.057]  We're good to go.
[03:29:25.033 --> 03:29:27.116]  And America's still quasi-free.
[03:29:27.116 --> 03:29:32.243]  You can't have InfoWars, it's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold.
[03:29:32.243 --> 03:29:34.346]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[03:29:34.346 --> 03:29:40.514]  So thank you all, and get into InfoWarsTore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more.
[03:29:40.514 --> 03:29:42.277]  They're wonderful products, and they support the InfoWars.
[03:29:42.277 --> 03:29:42.517]  Thank you.
[03:29:43.798 --> 03:29:46.280]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:47.561]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:29:47.561 --> 03:29:51.024]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:29:51.024 --> 03:29:52.365]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:29:52.365 --> 03:29:54.847]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:29:54.847 --> 03:30:00.711]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[03:30:00.871 --> 03:30:02.693]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:30:02.693 --> 03:30:04.594]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:30:04.594 --> 03:30:06.516]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[03:30:06.516 --> 03:30:16.404]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single
[03:30:16.624 --> 03:30:17.104]  One of them.
[03:30:17.104 --> 03:30:21.247]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:30:21.247 --> 03:30:24.128]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:30:24.128 --> 03:30:26.569]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[03:30:26.569 --> 03:30:30.252]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:30:30.252 --> 03:30:33.593]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:30:33.593 --> 03:30:35.815]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[03:30:35.815 --> 03:30:41.077]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:30:41.077 --> 03:30:43.579]  We need more of this communications, not less.

[03:32:04.253 --> 03:32:05.414]  And you constantly forget.

[03:32:40.427 --> 03:32:46.790]  1776 at InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:49.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:10.668 --> 03:33:17.234]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:17.234 --> 03:33:20.977]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:26.711]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.711 --> 03:33:32.294]  And as I say, take advantage of these mega sales they have going on now.
[03:33:32.294 --> 03:33:37.638]  And in that spirit of 1776, fight for freedom, do what you can.
[03:33:37.638 --> 03:33:42.861]  And Infowars is helping you do that, as we do with the Trends Journal.
[03:33:42.861 --> 03:33:50.166]  You know, I was talking about, you know, what's going on and that Bezos and all these other billionaires, not a penny for peace.
[03:33:50.166 --> 03:33:52.188]  Not a penny for peace.
[03:33:52.188 --> 03:33:54.129]  But they keep the war machine going.
[03:33:55.180 --> 03:34:05.564]  And now the warmongers in Congress, they're pushing for record spending for the military-industrial complex.
[03:34:05.564 --> 03:34:10.325]  It's going to be over, when it comes in it's going to be over a trillion bucks.
[03:34:10.325 --> 03:34:12.486]  A trillion dollars.
[03:34:12.486 --> 03:34:18.488]  And you know the guy that plays our Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin.
[03:34:18.488 --> 03:34:18.708]  Yeah.
[03:34:20.037 --> 03:34:21.697]  Where was his last job?
[03:34:21.697 --> 03:34:26.198]  Sat on the board of directors of Raytheon, the second largest defense contractor in America.
[03:34:26.198 --> 03:34:30.159]  So this is very serious.
[03:34:30.159 --> 03:34:34.160]  As I say, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:36.761]  What followed the Great Depression?
[03:34:36.761 --> 03:34:38.801]  Ah, World War II.
[03:34:38.801 --> 03:34:40.742]  What followed the dot-com bust?
[03:34:40.742 --> 03:34:47.223]  Oh, you mean the, uh, blowing up of the, uh, the World Trade Center?
[03:34:47.223 --> 03:34:48.504]  The 9-11, you mean?
[03:34:48.504 --> 03:34:49.664]  Yeah, yeah, that happened.
[03:34:51.411 --> 03:34:57.755]  Oh, the Nasdaq was only down 66% before 9-11.
[03:34:57.755 --> 03:35:02.018]  This global economy is going down big and hard.
[03:35:02.018 --> 03:35:09.363]  The markets going up in the United States is a joke as the economy goes down for the average person.
[03:35:09.363 --> 03:35:15.407]  63% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.
[03:35:15.407 --> 03:35:16.948]  And now on the war machine front,
[03:35:17.978 --> 03:35:19.579]  I was talking about what's going on with China.
[03:35:19.579 --> 03:35:22.261]  When all else fails, they take it to war.
[03:35:22.261 --> 03:35:25.864]  Same thing's gonna happen in China.
[03:35:25.864 --> 03:35:29.186]  Bye-bye Taiwan!
[03:35:29.186 --> 03:35:32.669]  And by the way, people have no idea the history of what went on.
[03:35:32.669 --> 03:35:34.911]  They used to call it Formosa at one time.
[03:35:34.911 --> 03:35:36.512]  That's the Portuguese name.
[03:35:36.512 --> 03:35:40.755]  When I was a kid, I remember that name.
[03:35:40.755 --> 03:35:43.157]  Going back to the Ming Dynasty.
[03:35:43.157 --> 03:35:45.739]  Anyway, the Chinese economy's going down big.
[03:35:47.003 --> 03:35:51.704]  The chip makers are having a tough time getting chips.
[03:35:51.704 --> 03:35:54.965]  When all else fails, they take it to war.
[03:35:54.965 --> 03:35:56.885]  So now the Taiwan war is going to heat up.
[03:35:56.885 --> 03:36:01.246]  They're going to overtake it.
[03:36:01.246 --> 03:36:02.567]  Again, people have no idea.
[03:36:02.567 --> 03:36:04.187]  How did Taiwan get to where it is?
[03:36:04.187 --> 03:36:14.750]  Or the guy running the show before the communists overtook it, Chiang Kai-shek, him and those people, they left and they went to Taiwan.
[03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:16.330]  The United States, by the way,
[03:36:18.402 --> 03:36:31.669]  Has sent 10 billion dollars of our money, the plantation workers of Slavelandia, our money for military equipment for Taiwan to fight China.
[03:36:31.669 --> 03:36:34.631]  Taiwan is one of the richest countries in Asia.
[03:36:34.631 --> 03:36:37.452]  It may be the richest.
[03:36:37.452 --> 03:36:43.836]  And tens of billions of dollars, and they got more on the chart, that are going to Taiwan.
[03:36:46.636 --> 03:36:49.419]  Enriching the military-industrial complex.
[03:36:49.419 --> 03:36:52.601]  And Biden says we're going to defend Taiwan.
[03:36:52.601 --> 03:36:56.505]  Oh yeah, you did a great job defending... You did a great job in North Korea.
[03:36:56.505 --> 03:36:58.066]  In the Korean War, rather.
[03:36:58.066 --> 03:36:59.608]  Terrific in the Vietnam War.
[03:36:59.608 --> 03:37:02.870]  Man, what a home run you hit in the Afghan War.
[03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:07.374]  You mean you couldn't beat the Taliban?
[03:37:07.374 --> 03:37:09.616]  You couldn't beat the Iraqis?
[03:37:09.616 --> 03:37:11.158]  And you're going to beat the Chinese?
[03:37:11.158 --> 03:37:12.419]  What am I, six years old?
[03:37:13.732 --> 03:37:15.032]  Oh, Salenti, stop it!
[03:37:15.032 --> 03:37:22.614]  Be stupid like the rest of the Americans and swallow the crap that the government throws out.
[03:37:22.614 --> 03:37:25.234]  Goes back to gold.
[03:37:25.234 --> 03:37:32.075]  To me, it's the most precious of the precious metals.
[03:37:32.075 --> 03:37:41.137]  So all eyes, and we're going to have to write about it a lot in this Trends Journal going out tomorrow, are on Big Bad Beijing.
[03:37:46.745 --> 03:37:53.129]  And as for the equity markets, they have no connection to the real world.
[03:37:53.129 --> 03:37:55.831]  1% owns 54% of all the stocks.
[03:37:55.831 --> 03:37:55.851]  1%!
[03:37:55.851 --> 03:37:55.871]  10%!
[03:37:55.871 --> 03:37:58.553]  It comes up to about 90%.
[03:38:11.064 --> 03:38:14.546]  Which leaves the plantation workers of slave land to you.
[03:38:14.546 --> 03:38:21.650]  You know, you got these things in your retirement fund.
[03:38:21.650 --> 03:38:22.611]  Pennies.
[03:38:22.611 --> 03:38:25.393]  Pennies.
[03:38:25.393 --> 03:38:26.633]  They're not going to let it go down.
[03:38:26.633 --> 03:38:30.636]  They're going to do everything they can.
[03:38:30.636 --> 03:38:33.638]  But watch out what goes on in China.
[03:38:33.638 --> 03:38:35.739]  Because their economy is going down big.
[03:38:37.165 --> 03:38:45.011]  I had forecast that China was going to overtake America as the largest economy in the world within the next seven years.
[03:38:45.011 --> 03:38:48.454]  Not anymore.
[03:38:48.454 --> 03:38:50.195]  Their exports are down.
[03:38:50.195 --> 03:38:52.117]  Their imports are down.
[03:38:52.117 --> 03:38:55.740]  Their GDP is down.
[03:38:55.740 --> 03:39:00.844]  Retail sales across the board, down, down, down, down, down, and they're locking up more.
[03:39:00.844 --> 03:39:02.785]  Locking up more.
[03:39:02.785 --> 03:39:03.466]  Locking up more.
[03:39:05.160 --> 03:39:06.901]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:39:06.901 --> 03:39:10.323]  They're going to take the people to war against Taiwan.
[03:39:10.323 --> 03:39:14.545]  Oh, and the American people are going to want to defend Taiwan.
[03:39:14.545 --> 03:39:15.265]  Oh, we have to.
[03:39:15.265 --> 03:39:16.066]  It's our duty.
[03:39:16.066 --> 03:39:17.566]  Yeah, it's our duty.
[03:39:17.566 --> 03:39:20.328]  It's none of your business.
[03:39:20.328 --> 03:39:21.649]  Oh, why?
[03:39:21.649 --> 03:39:23.089]  Don't you want to help the people?
[03:39:23.089 --> 03:39:28.452]  Oh, you bring freedom and democracy like you don't have here in America?
[03:39:28.452 --> 03:39:29.993]  Look at the elections we had.
[03:39:32.563 --> 03:39:37.927]  Democrats vs. Republicans, to me, equals Bloods vs. Crips.
[03:39:37.927 --> 03:39:40.850]  Murderers and thieves.
[03:39:40.850 --> 03:39:43.472]  No third party.
[03:39:43.472 --> 03:39:45.573]  Only elections rigged?
[03:39:45.573 --> 03:39:48.556]  Ask Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:39:48.556 --> 03:39:52.579]  Go to paulcraigroberts.com.
[03:39:52.579 --> 03:39:56.362]  And you got all the data of the rigging.
[03:39:56.362 --> 03:39:57.643]  America.
[03:39:57.643 --> 03:40:00.525]  I got the simple solution, by the way, to this whole
[03:40:01.508 --> 03:40:05.290]  Election fraud.
[03:40:05.290 --> 03:40:07.051]  Writing ballots.
[03:40:07.051 --> 03:40:08.312]  And no mailing in.
[03:40:08.312 --> 03:40:10.133]  You got election day.
[03:40:10.133 --> 03:40:12.114]  Election day you go to the polls.
[03:40:12.114 --> 03:40:13.895]  They give you a piece of paper.
[03:40:13.895 --> 03:40:16.317]  You mark off who you want.
[03:40:16.317 --> 03:40:18.998]  You have the people counting them.
[03:40:18.998 --> 03:40:25.342]  Not the machines that could be easily rigged and stupidly rigged as they're rigged.
[03:40:25.342 --> 03:40:27.183]  And it's mail-in ballot crap.
[03:40:30.996 --> 03:40:34.097]  What happened to Election Day?
[03:40:34.097 --> 03:40:39.298]  So it's a very simple solution.
[03:40:39.298 --> 03:40:42.379]  Write in ballots like they have in most countries in the world.
[03:40:42.379 --> 03:40:43.619]  Democracy!
[03:40:43.619 --> 03:40:44.179]  Duh!
[03:40:44.179 --> 03:40:44.959]  Democracy!
[03:40:44.959 --> 03:40:45.359]  D-U-H!
[03:40:45.359 --> 03:40:46.260]  Duh!
[03:40:46.260 --> 03:40:48.000]  Democracy!
[03:40:48.000 --> 03:40:50.061]  Republicans and Democrats.
[03:40:50.061 --> 03:40:52.541]  And I vote for lesser of two evils.
[03:40:52.541 --> 03:40:54.402]  Yeah.
[03:40:54.402 --> 03:40:55.902]  Whoever you vote for, you lose.
[03:41:00.214 --> 03:41:03.575]  Again, it's a crime syndicate to me.
[03:41:03.575 --> 03:41:06.036]  Murderers and thieves, by their deeds you shall know them.
[03:41:06.036 --> 03:41:11.039]  Look at the money they steal from us and give to the corporate buddies and the banksters.
[03:41:11.039 --> 03:41:13.440]  Look at the wars that they start and they kill people.
[03:41:13.440 --> 03:41:16.041]  Those Russians, ooh.
[03:41:16.041 --> 03:41:19.602]  Anyway, we got a lot going on.
[03:41:19.602 --> 03:41:25.645]  And we're in very, very critical times and that's why it's important for you to stay tuned to InfoWars.
[03:41:25.645 --> 03:41:28.986]  To have a wide variety of guests put out a wide variety of information.
[03:41:31.954 --> 03:41:38.139]  And again, this Ukraine war, this is a wild card, the likes of which we've never seen.
[03:41:38.139 --> 03:41:40.301]  And you're not allowed again to negotiate for peace.
[03:41:40.301 --> 03:41:50.308]  They went after this guy Miley, the guy who plays the Joint Chiefs of Staff, saying that they should consider talking about peace.
[03:41:50.308 --> 03:41:56.453]  And the Biden administration went after him.
[03:41:56.453 --> 03:41:58.314]  There's going to be a holdup in the war.
[03:41:58.314 --> 03:41:59.035]  Winter's coming.
[03:42:00.891 --> 03:42:04.814]  The Russians are going to secure their places.
[03:42:04.814 --> 03:42:08.756]  Meanwhile, almost 50% of the energy is gone in Ukraine.
[03:42:08.756 --> 03:42:13.899]  Wouldn't you love to live there with the winter coming?
[03:42:13.899 --> 03:42:15.841]  So again, it goes back, what do you invest in?
[03:42:15.841 --> 03:42:17.982]  I don't give financial advice.
[03:42:17.982 --> 03:42:25.887]  But to me, gold is the number one safe haven asset.
[03:42:25.887 --> 03:42:26.928]  And what do you invest in?
[03:42:26.928 --> 03:42:28.309]  You invest in InfoWars.
[03:42:29.497 --> 03:42:33.102]  They have products that can help you.
[03:42:33.102 --> 03:42:36.667]  And by helping you, you also help InfoWars.
[03:42:36.667 --> 03:42:37.208]  It's a 360 win.
[03:42:37.208 --> 03:42:40.413]  We're going to take a break.
[03:42:40.413 --> 03:42:41.174]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:46.607 --> 03:42:50.948]  The globalists are in an absolute panic right now.
[03:42:50.948 --> 03:43:02.132]  They are attacking and suing and censoring and spying on and engaging in bullying and physical attacks against populist conservatives and Christians, not just in America, but worldwide.
[03:43:03.072 --> 03:43:14.861]  Number one most hated enemy in the media is Info Wars because we know the globalist number, we know their operation, we know their modus operandi, and we know how to take them down peacefully.
[03:43:14.861 --> 03:43:18.064]  We've got great products that fund the operation that also are
[03:43:18.524 --> 03:43:22.045]  Incredibly powerful and the highest quality for your immune system and more.
[03:43:22.045 --> 03:43:23.946]  We have the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[03:43:23.946 --> 03:43:25.206]  Black Friday comes early.

[03:43:33.448 --> 03:43:34.308]  Biggest sale of the year.

[03:43:36.069 --> 03:43:37.189]  Up to 60% off.

[03:43:42.805 --> 03:43:45.288]  Alex, why is this taking so long?
[03:43:45.288 --> 03:43:46.569]  Why is this taking so long?
[03:43:46.569 --> 03:43:50.052]  In France, they can count all the paper ballots and they're done in a day.
[03:43:50.052 --> 03:43:51.373]  Why can't we do this here?
[03:43:51.373 --> 03:43:53.875]  The answer is fraud and corruption.
[03:43:53.875 --> 03:43:59.721]  If we don't fix the system, it doesn't matter whether the Republican nominee is Donald Trump or Governor DeSanctimonious.
[03:43:59.901 --> 03:44:01.723]  They're going to deny us Michigan.
[03:44:01.723 --> 03:44:03.624]  They're going to deny us Pennsylvania.
[03:44:03.624 --> 03:44:05.546]  They're going to deny us Arizona.
[03:44:05.546 --> 03:44:15.555]  And I can't come to 270 electoral votes without any of those states where I believe there is an America first majority in every single one.
[03:44:15.635 --> 03:44:16.115]  One of them.
[03:44:16.115 --> 03:44:20.257]  So we need to keep fighting for reform of the system.
[03:44:20.257 --> 03:44:23.158]  Tucker Carlson said this better last night than anything else.
[03:44:23.158 --> 03:44:25.579]  Communications are the reason why we did well.
[03:44:25.579 --> 03:44:29.281]  That's why Infowars.com is so damn important.
[03:44:29.281 --> 03:44:32.602]  That's why they're so desperate to take you off the air, Alex.
[03:44:32.602 --> 03:44:34.843]  People need to get behind Infowars.
[03:44:34.843 --> 03:44:40.086]  This alternative media that we work so hard to bring you is vitally important.
[03:44:40.086 --> 03:44:42.587]  We need more of this communications, not less.

[03:45:44.431 --> 03:45:50.013]  Don't let the Globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[03:45:51.192 --> 03:46:04.978]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[03:46:04.978 --> 03:46:19.044]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.

[03:46:23.682 --> 03:46:27.144]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[03:46:27.144 --> 03:46:29.906]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[03:46:29.906 --> 03:46:34.228]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[03:46:46.796 --> 03:46:49.418]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:03.856 --> 03:47:06.216]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:06.216 --> 03:47:08.917]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:47:08.917 --> 03:47:12.779]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:12.779 --> 03:47:16.540]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.540 --> 03:47:23.242]  You know, as I said, you know, the news out there is just nothing more than propaganda.
[03:47:24.290 --> 03:47:26.911]  And, you know, just sell their lies continually.
[03:47:26.911 --> 03:47:30.773]  The Toilet Paper Record, they call themselves the Paper Record, the New York Times.
[03:47:30.773 --> 03:47:36.715]  You know, remember they sold the Iraq War saying, you know, Saddam Hussein had them aluminum tubes.
[03:47:36.715 --> 03:47:38.376]  It was proof, you know.
[03:47:38.376 --> 03:47:41.817]  Anyway, so InfoWars, and again, we do the same thing with the Trends Journal.
[03:47:41.817 --> 03:47:44.519]  We give you the facts, not the fiction.
[03:47:44.519 --> 03:47:50.561]  And one of my favorite products from InfoWars is Supermail Vitality.
[03:47:50.561 --> 03:47:51.181]  Ka-choo!
[03:47:51.181 --> 03:47:52.462]  You gotta be a supermail.
[03:47:53.234 --> 03:47:54.395]  And have vitality.
[03:47:54.395 --> 03:47:56.296]  And that's lost in this country, man.
[03:47:56.296 --> 03:47:57.476]  You know.
[03:47:57.476 --> 03:47:58.557]  Lola.
[03:47:58.557 --> 03:47:59.397]  L-O-L-A.
[03:47:59.397 --> 03:48:00.378]  Lola.
[03:48:00.378 --> 03:48:01.218]  Yeah.
[03:48:01.218 --> 03:48:04.880]  So I love super male vitality and super female vitality.
[03:48:04.880 --> 03:48:09.863]  You know, it's a... The better of both parts.
[03:48:09.863 --> 03:48:10.604]  You know.
[03:48:10.604 --> 03:48:12.144]  All parts are equal.
[03:48:12.144 --> 03:48:17.427]  And so, super male vitality and female super vitality.
[03:48:17.427 --> 03:48:19.569]  These are great products.
[03:48:19.569 --> 03:48:21.670]  And I love this.
[03:48:21.670 --> 03:48:22.090]  I love it.
[03:48:22.953 --> 03:48:25.214]  And again, I'm gonna be 76.
[03:48:25.214 --> 03:48:27.696]  Spirit is 76.
[03:48:27.696 --> 03:48:32.659]  And super male vitality keeps that spirit going, you know?
[03:48:32.659 --> 03:48:33.719]  Yep.
[03:48:33.719 --> 03:48:34.920]  And you know how I feel.
[03:48:34.920 --> 03:48:39.943]  You gotta boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy.
[03:48:39.943 --> 03:48:44.386]  So anyway, talking about what's going on, you know, the Dow is up.
[03:48:44.386 --> 03:48:47.287]  It was a hundred and something points before I got on the air.
[03:48:47.287 --> 03:48:47.988]  And now it's down.
[03:48:49.631 --> 03:48:53.435]  So they're going to do what they can to keep the equity markets going up.
[03:48:53.435 --> 03:48:56.277]  End of story.
[03:48:56.277 --> 03:49:00.601]  And the inflation is way worse than what they're saying.
[03:49:00.601 --> 03:49:05.505]  When you go to, I subscribe to it actually, John Williams Shadow Stats.
[03:49:05.505 --> 03:49:11.351]  They rigged the numbers back in the late 70s, early 80s, so they wouldn't have to pay us more Social Security.
[03:49:11.351 --> 03:49:15.655]  Because Social Security went up according to the Consumer Price Index.
[03:49:16.917 --> 03:49:19.658]  So they took out, like, housing prices.
[03:49:19.658 --> 03:49:24.198]  I think the average price of a home now is almost $400,000.
[03:49:24.198 --> 03:49:24.579]  $400,000.
[03:49:24.579 --> 03:49:33.380]  And you saw them go up by 26%, 38% when the COVID war happened.
[03:49:33.380 --> 03:49:36.821]  That's not included in inflation.
[03:49:36.821 --> 03:49:37.861]  Prices of steak went up?
[03:49:37.861 --> 03:49:38.341]  No, no, no.
[03:49:38.341 --> 03:49:41.422]  People changed their eating habits so we don't put it in there.
[03:49:41.422 --> 03:49:42.342]  It's a rigged game.
[03:49:44.073 --> 03:49:45.954]  Going back to the markets.
[03:49:45.954 --> 03:49:49.757]  They're going to do everything they can to keep the markets going.
[03:49:49.757 --> 03:50:04.046]  And we have a great article in here, in the Trends Journal going out tomorrow, by Gregory Manorino, about how these interest rates are going to do nothing, nothing, to affect inflation.
[03:50:04.046 --> 03:50:07.708]  And the BS they keep throwing out there is, oh, inflation is going down.
[03:50:07.708 --> 03:50:09.950]  It's going down, but look how high it is!
[03:50:12.870 --> 03:50:18.994]  Look how high the number is.
[03:50:18.994 --> 03:50:20.915]  Prices aren't going back to where they were.
[03:50:20.915 --> 03:50:25.659]  It's still way up there.
[03:50:25.659 --> 03:50:27.260]  Oh, lumber prices went down 40%.
[03:50:27.260 --> 03:50:33.884]  Yeah, but how much are they higher than they were before the COVID war?
[03:50:33.884 --> 03:50:35.545]  So it's a cheap money game.
[03:50:35.545 --> 03:50:40.749]  And they're going to keep pumping in the cheap money
[03:50:42.193 --> 03:50:44.634]  To keep the scheme going.
[03:50:44.634 --> 03:50:48.755]  Particularly in Europe.
[03:50:48.755 --> 03:50:53.236]  You have inflation over 10% in Europe.
[03:50:53.236 --> 03:50:56.096]  Over 10%.
[03:50:56.096 --> 03:50:58.157]  What's the interest rate?
[03:50:58.157 --> 03:50:58.417]  1.50.
[03:50:58.417 --> 03:51:03.138]  They aggressively raised them 75 basis points twice.
[03:51:03.138 --> 03:51:04.058]  Who are you talking to?
[03:51:06.325 --> 03:51:07.925]  What do you mean aggressively raising?
[03:51:07.925 --> 03:51:11.926]  They said when inflation hit 2% they'd be raising interest rates.
[03:51:11.926 --> 03:51:17.808]  Oh yeah, but they said inflation wasn't coming.
[03:51:17.808 --> 03:51:18.768]  You see where this is going?
[03:51:18.768 --> 03:51:27.770]  They're going to do everything they can to artificially prop up the markets.
[03:51:27.770 --> 03:51:29.230]  So what does that mean?
[03:51:29.230 --> 03:51:35.992]  More inflation and a declining economy because as they raise interest rates even they're going to put more people out of work.
[03:51:37.285 --> 03:51:43.289]  Again, every week in the Trends Journal, we have the job layoffs.
[03:51:43.289 --> 03:51:45.271]  Astounding!
[03:51:45.271 --> 03:51:49.574]  Astounding!
[03:51:49.574 --> 03:51:57.860]  So, again, when inflation goes up, gold goes up.
[03:51:57.860 --> 03:52:01.622]  When economies go down, gold goes up.
[03:52:01.622 --> 03:52:04.024]  When interest rates go way up, gold goes down.
[03:52:05.325 --> 03:52:13.887]  Because the value of the dollar increases and gold is dollar-based, so people around the world can't buy it.
[03:52:13.887 --> 03:52:25.609]  But, you look, we did an article in last week's Trends Journal about all the central banksters that are buying gold.
[03:52:25.609 --> 03:52:28.170]  And then going back to the picture I was talking about before,
[03:52:32.771 --> 03:52:39.254]  I told you about tens of thousands of Italians take to the streets in opposition to armed shipments to Ukraine.
[03:52:39.254 --> 03:52:42.216]  You don't have that here.
[03:52:42.216 --> 03:52:45.957]  And it's one after another, the protests going on.
[03:52:45.957 --> 03:52:47.618]  I mentioned Belgium.
[03:52:47.618 --> 03:52:49.419]  I mentioned Germany.
[03:52:49.419 --> 03:52:51.240]  I mentioned Greece.
[03:52:51.240 --> 03:52:54.262]  I mentioned France.
[03:52:54.262 --> 03:53:00.605]  And again, for all different reasons, but the bottom line is money.
[03:53:00.605 --> 03:53:01.025]  Poland.
[03:53:02.202 --> 03:53:02.902]  Bulgaria?
[03:53:02.902 --> 03:53:20.407]  This inflation is destroying people and it's brought to you by the morons and imbeciles that put in sanctions against Russia.
[03:53:20.407 --> 03:53:24.409]  This is hardly making me, it doesn't make the American news hardly at all.
[03:53:24.409 --> 03:53:25.349]  You gotta go look for it.
[03:53:30.160 --> 03:53:35.823]  Tens of thousands of protesters marched in Warsaw Friday, on Polish Independence Day.
[03:53:35.823 --> 03:53:39.166]  And you know what they have concerns about?
[03:53:39.166 --> 03:53:51.253]  They're against the European Union, and against immigration.
[03:53:51.253 --> 03:53:56.296]  An Italian doctor stopped by, a guy from Italy, on Saturday.
[03:53:58.675 --> 03:54:04.380]  And he was telling me how terrible the immigration issue is in Italy.
[03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:07.802]  And how low the country's going and how fast it's going down.
[03:54:07.802 --> 03:54:14.508]  And how the culture's dying.
[03:54:14.508 --> 03:54:16.750]  You haven't seen anything yet.
[03:54:16.750 --> 03:54:21.934]  It's the New World Disorder!
[03:54:21.934 --> 03:54:28.219]  People are protesting against sending armed shipments to Ukraine as their country's going down.
[03:54:28.914 --> 03:54:36.878]  The sanctions that are making them poorer as the rich get richer.
[03:54:36.878 --> 03:54:39.479]  Government corruption.
[03:54:39.479 --> 03:54:41.260]  Crime.
[03:54:41.260 --> 03:54:42.841]  Violence.
[03:54:42.841 --> 03:54:48.643]  You think you want to leave your country?
[03:54:48.643 --> 03:54:49.824]  This has just begun.
[03:54:49.824 --> 03:54:53.866]  And when the winter sets in, it's going to be much worse.
[03:54:55.911 --> 03:54:59.733]  You know, another article is going to come out in your Trans-Journal.
[03:54:59.733 --> 03:55:01.354]  Everybody got worried about COVID.
[03:55:01.354 --> 03:55:03.295]  You worry about COVID?
[03:55:03.295 --> 03:55:06.777]  How about all the poisons they're putting in our food, in the water, in the air.
[03:55:06.777 --> 03:55:11.980]  All these chemical companies, how they're killing us.
[03:55:11.980 --> 03:55:16.522]  And now 3M and DuPont are being sued over Forever Chemicals.
[03:55:16.522 --> 03:55:21.885]  Isn't that a wonderful name, Forever Chemicals?
[03:55:21.885 --> 03:55:24.867]  It's like, you know, being sued for the GMOs.
[03:55:27.034 --> 03:55:29.557]  Look how they're killing us with all this stuff.
[03:55:29.557 --> 03:55:31.679]  But here's the point.
[03:55:31.679 --> 03:55:37.546]  It's prosecution to the fullest for we the little people of Slavelandia.
[03:55:37.546 --> 03:55:39.528]  Where were you?
[03:55:39.528 --> 03:55:41.830]  The taillight was off in the back of your car.
[03:55:41.830 --> 03:55:44.133]  How many drinks did you have?
[03:55:44.133 --> 03:55:46.756]  Stand on your head, repeat the vowel alphabet backwards.
[03:55:47.805 --> 03:55:54.189]  They lock you up and send you off to jail for being over some fake limit that they made up of a breathalyzer test.
[03:55:54.189 --> 03:56:00.873]  A fake number like stands six feet apart because COVID doesn't go six feet.
[03:56:00.873 --> 03:56:02.894]  COVID stops at six feet!
[03:56:02.894 --> 03:56:08.377]  The wind doesn't blow in circles or up and down, it blows in straight lines.
[03:56:08.377 --> 03:56:13.420]  So what I'm saying is, prosecution to the fullest for us, but hey,
[03:56:16.232 --> 03:56:21.495]  You think 3M and DuPont heads are gonna go to jail?
[03:56:21.495 --> 03:56:26.597]  For killing us with forever chemicals?
[03:56:26.597 --> 03:56:28.438]  Forever?
[03:56:28.438 --> 03:56:29.578]  Forever and ever?
[03:56:29.578 --> 03:56:32.620]  Oh, you're worried about COVID though, huh?
[03:56:32.620 --> 03:56:32.840]  Yeah.
[03:56:33.664 --> 03:56:35.725]  Oh, you love those artificial flavors.
[03:56:35.725 --> 03:56:37.886]  I like artificial colors.
[03:56:37.886 --> 03:56:40.487]  I like ultra-processed food.
[03:56:40.487 --> 03:56:43.128]  Oh, blimped out America.
[03:56:43.128 --> 03:56:53.531]  And by the way, that guy Fetterman, that slob that got elected over there in Pennsylvania with the hoodie and the... He symbolizes America today.
[03:56:53.531 --> 03:56:55.692]  How low can you go?
[03:56:55.692 --> 03:56:57.773]  Fetterman low.
[03:56:57.773 --> 03:56:59.814]  That's how low.
[03:56:59.814 --> 03:57:01.394]  That's America.
[03:57:01.394 --> 03:57:02.635]  Unless we turn it around.
[03:57:03.988 --> 03:57:07.949]  And InfoWars is helping you do that, and we're doing it with the Trends Journal.
[03:57:07.949 --> 03:57:14.792]  This guy Fetterman is an example of how America's slobbed out.
[03:57:14.792 --> 03:57:19.674]  Slobbed out on slob food.
[03:57:19.674 --> 03:57:24.135]  And a slob brain now in charge.
[03:57:24.135 --> 03:57:26.056]  Of a country near you.
[03:57:26.056 --> 03:57:28.137]  Look at this guy!
[03:57:28.137 --> 03:57:29.877]  Woof!
[03:57:29.877 --> 03:57:31.578]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:57:31.578 --> 03:57:32.218]  See you next week.
[03:57:35.447 --> 03:57:37.569]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[03:57:37.569 --> 03:57:40.311]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[03:57:40.311 --> 03:57:42.332]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[03:57:42.332 --> 03:57:44.394]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[03:57:44.394 --> 03:57:46.135]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[03:57:46.135 --> 03:57:48.517]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[03:57:48.517 --> 03:57:49.938]  You forget to take DX3.
[03:57:49.938 --> 03:57:51.439]  And you know it makes your life better.
[03:57:51.439 --> 03:57:52.920]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[03:57:52.920 --> 03:57:54.081]  And you constantly forget.
[03:57:54.081 --> 03:57:56.023]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[03:57:56.681 --> 03:57:59.663]  This stuff will blow you away, plus it funds our operation.

[03:58:33.929 --> 03:58:45.232]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:58:45.232 --> 03:58:47.133]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:58:47.133 --> 03:58:48.593]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:58:48.593 --> 03:58:50.094]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:58:50.094 --> 03:58:51.854]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:58:51.854 --> 03:58:53.094]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:58:53.094 --> 03:58:54.915]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:58:54.915 --> 03:58:59.776]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:58:59.776 --> 03:59:01.677]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere,
[03:59:02.137 --> 03:59:04.158]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:59:04.158 --> 03:59:11.123]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, Honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[03:59:11.753 --> 03:59:17.134]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
